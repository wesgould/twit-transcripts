[00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.800]   It's time for Twig this week in Google
[00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.000]   and we've got a big, really big show for you
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.720]   with the regulars, of course, starting with Jeff Jarvis
[00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.920]   from buzzmachine.com.
[00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.960]   It's good to see you, Jeff.
[00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.600]   Android, ready with questions?
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.720]   Oh, good.
[00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.840]   Yeah, this is going to be the Android Nexus 1 tips show,
[00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.240]   I think, because Gina Trapani and I are big fans.
[00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.680]   There's Gina Trapani.
[00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:16.760]   There's mine with answers.
[00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.560]   Smartaward.org.
[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.680]   Am I supposed to hold mine up too now?
[00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:22.960]   Since we're all in the family.
[00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.960]   And of course joining us--
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.600]   Let's see if Siva's going to be joining.
[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:28.560]   Yes, he--
[00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.600]   No, it's an iPhone.
[00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.200]   Yeah, it's an iPhone.
[00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.680]   Siva Vaidianathan, who is the author of the Googleization
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:35.000]   of everything.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.400]   So 2007, I'm--
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.600]   Yeah, even Steve Wozniak gave up the iPhone.
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.120]   What's your--
[00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.600]   What's your art classes, Siva?
[00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.680]   Siva is a professor at--
[00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.760]   is it University of Virginia?
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:48.440]   That's correct, yes.
[00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:49.640]   UVA.
[00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.080]   Thomas Jefferson's alma mater.
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.080]   Yep.
[00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.920]   And here, because I think you have quite a bit to say
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.240]   about the big blockbuster story of the week,
[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.200]   the late night shenanigans with Conan O'Brien and Jay Leno.
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.160]   I think it's going to be the whole show.
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.200]   No, I'm not talking about that.
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.920]   I'm talking about the fact that Google got so pissed off
[00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.240]   at the world's largest nation, the world's biggest group
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:21.680]   of internet users that they're ready to pull out.
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.680]   You wrote a great blog post, I thought, Jeff,
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.000]   applauding Google, saying, yay, this is how--
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.240]   if you're going to do no evil, this is how you do it.
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.160]   Why don't you give us the rundown of what happened,
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.120]   then we'll get a dissenting opinion.
[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.480]   Well, it is a chicken egg question
[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.960]   as to what actually caused this.
[00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.000]   There were cyber attacks on Google,
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.520]   and I think the number is now more than 30 other companies.
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.240]   Google said they were going after the email accounts
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.520]   of people fighting for human rights.
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.280]   And other things, including, I think,
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.240]   Google Code as well and that of other companies.
[00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.600]   Not ever said directly that this was the Chinese government,
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:04.040]   no smoking hacker to show that it was the Chinese government,
[00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.800]   but the assumption is that it is.
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.440]   Well, in fact, yeah, I think Secretary of State Clinton
[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:11.120]   thinks it is, because I think she said the State Department
[00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.840]   said, we want some splaining to do, China.
[00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.280]   You've got to say, what happened.
[00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:18.200]   And at the same time, it came along
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.560]   to say that they said that they were going to sometime
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.720]   in the near future stop censoring Google.cn results
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.520]   at the behest of the Chinese government.
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:28.680]   And we're going to open discussions
[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.960]   with the Chinese government about whether they could stay there,
[00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:35.080]   which is to say that they're threatening to pull out.
[00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.600]   Is that a fair summary?
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.320]   Seems so, Siva.
[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.320]   And I should say that Jeff, you applauded it, as I did.
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:41.880]   Yes.
[00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:42.800]   When I heard about it.
[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.840]   I mean, having being the official Google fanboy,
[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.560]   having written the book on being a Google fanboy--
[00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.480]   I was looking for a copy-- but the one thing people always
[00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.640]   throw at me and that I throw at Google is Google's China
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:57.640]   policy.
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:59.920]   And as far as I'm concerned, Google
[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.760]   stands to benefit from free speech more than any other company
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.400]   ever, even more than publishers.
[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.000]   It enables free speech.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.640]   And I thought that Google should stand up for free speech
[00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:12.960]   as a result.
[00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:17.600]   And it's old policy was that a hampered internet,
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.960]   a hampered Google was better for the Chinese people
[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:22.200]   than no Google at all.
[00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.800]   But I argued in the book and since that Google has more power
[00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.960]   here than even it knows.
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.000]   And the problem I see with China is that because the market is
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.520]   so large and are lust for its revenue and the fact
[00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.080]   that it holds us by the short hairs in debt,
[00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.840]   has made everyone chicken to go after China
[00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.080]   and demand something better.
[00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.240]   You have companies like Yahoo that have handed over email
[00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.840]   addresses for dissidents, Cisco, Nokia, Siemens,
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.160]   are helping China in their censorship.
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.680]   Steve Bomber this week through Google under the bus
[00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.120]   and said, I don't know what's the problem.
[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:04.120]   He was kind of like the J-Lintl of technology.
[00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.880]   And I think it's important to stand up.
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:08.840]   Siva in his post-- he's a very good post.
[00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.000]   And he and I, as we always do, simply disagree on some
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.880]   of the points and not all.
[00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:18.120]   But it does make the analogy that I make as well to apartheid.
[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:26.240]   And at some point, you stand up for standards for principles.
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.160]   And the interesting thing I think too about Google here
[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:32.320]   is that a deep site in Germany called
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.760]   Google a quasi-state under the headline.
[00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:37.480]   I think it was the Google Reich.
[00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:43.640]   And Jim Fallows from Atlantic magazine who knows China well,
[00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:46.080]   the way he phrased it was that Google had cut off diplomatic
[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:47.800]   relations with China.
[00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:49.840]   And the interesting thing to me is what we're seeing here
[00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:54.760]   rise is the rise of what I call interest states.
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:06:01.760]   That Google is really acting a bit like a country.
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:04.400]   And it has the economy itself that's the size of, I think,
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:07.000]   the 29th largest country in the world.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.440]   And so we're starting to see these cross-border influences.
[00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:13.240]   And so the fact that Google is going up against China
[00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:17.720]   rather than the US or the EU or European countries
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.800]   tells a lot.
[00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:23.880]   Before we get to see, Vegeta, you concur?
[00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:24.400]   I do.
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:25.880]   I mean, it was a gutsy move.
[00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:29.160]   It was one that I also applauded and celebrated.
[00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.880]   I mean, I found it very interesting
[00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:34.200]   that the cause, the events that led up to it,
[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:37.160]   the hacking, the surveillance, and then the making
[00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:38.560]   that decision.
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.840]   But yeah, I pretty much concur with Jeff.
[00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:41.200]   I don't know.
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:44.960]   I feel like maybe Google being another kind of state
[00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:47.080]   feels like a little bit of a stretch for me.
[00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:48.200]   But I don't know.
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:49.920]   I can tell you how to use Android,
[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:52.240]   but I'm not the one you want commenting on politics
[00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:53.640]   or business.
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:55.760]   So I'll go with Jeff on that one.
[00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:57.760]   Yeah.
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:58.560]   I mean, yeah.
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:06:59.960]   Look, Google's just a big company.
[00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:02.280]   Ford decided not to make cars in China.
[00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:06.640]   Or I mean, there's economic clout that a big company has.
[00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:11.120]   Google's only 31% though of the search engine business
[00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:11.560]   in China.
[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:13.280]   Baidu is much bigger.
[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:17.120]   Sorry to put it this way, but Google is the new Coke.
[00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:19.560]   In that sense, the Coke was the symbol of America
[00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:21.280]   and the symbol of capitalism.
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:22.600]   And Google is that now.
[00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:23.640]   Right.
[00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:25.800]   Well, certainly it's got to have some impact.
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:28.400]   Now, Siva--
[00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:28.880]   Yeah.
[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:30.280]   What's your thought?
[00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:33.920]   The only major statement of Jeff's that I want to take issue with
[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:38.720]   is that Google is the new Coke because Coke is still Coke.
[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:41.880]   And Coke is still a dominant brand.
[00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:47.080]   And in many ways, the world's favorite corn syrup
[00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:48.040]   flavored beverage.
[00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:50.000]   So that's not changed.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.560]   No, but I actually am a bigger fan of this move
[00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:57.800]   than I think Jeff is.
[00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:02.040]   And I'm a bigger fan of Google's policy in China
[00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:06.320]   over the last five years than Jeff is, or just about anybody,
[00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:07.600]   actually.
[00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:08.640]   And I'll explain why.
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:14.840]   So first, let me say I don't believe in corporate responsibility.
[00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:18.160]   I actually don't think it's Google's business
[00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:23.320]   to be in the business of liberating anybody
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:29.560]   or enhancing anybody in particular's political agenda.
[00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:33.720]   But that's a nice byproduct of this,
[00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:36.080]   within limitations because I actually
[00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:38.080]   don't think Google has that much influence.
[00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:45.120]   Now, Google may be 31% of the current Chinese internet market,
[00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:48.680]   but we are talking about 100 million users
[00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:51.320]   because just over 300 million people in China
[00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:53.360]   use the internet every day.
[00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:56.320]   But we also have to remember that the vast majority of people
[00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:59.160]   in China are basically subsistence farmers.
[00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:04.800]   So the government of China has far bigger problems, challenges,
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:08.480]   issues, and thorns in their side than Google could ever
[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:10.600]   present with that context.
[00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:14.320]   But let me explain, first of all, why I think that for the past five
[00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:18.720]   years, Google's been doing the right thing in China.
[00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:24.640]   First of all, Google has never had the power
[00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:27.360]   to empower anybody.
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:30.240]   The people in China who are fighting for their rights
[00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:34.680]   to speak, their rights to practice their religion freely,
[00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:38.680]   their rights to raise little girls on equal terms, right?
[00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:43.360]   All of those important human rights, flesh and bone issues,
[00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:49.640]   are so much deeper, broader, and more grave than search
[00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:52.840]   results could ever affect.
[00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:57.560]   Having people in China be able to Google Falun Gong
[00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:01.640]   or find pictures of the tank man from the Tiananmen Square
[00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:05.800]   incidents in 1989 is not going to improve
[00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:08.200]   anyone's life significantly.
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:09.760]   Now, those are all sort of side issues
[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:16.840]   just to sort of think this particular move is important.
[00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:21.840]   Oh, see, but we're getting some hesitation on your skype.
[00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:22.840]   It's icing on the cake.
[00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:25.680]   It's nice that they get to feel good and make us feel good
[00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:28.880]   and get human rights organizations to applaud them finally.
[00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:31.160]   But basically, for the past five years,
[00:10:31.160 --> 00:10:34.160]   they have not been a human rights problem in China.
[00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:38.480]   While Cisco is, while Yahoo has been,
[00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:42.800]   Google was very deft and careful about how it did business in China.
[00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:45.960]   Cisco, because it turned over information about dissidents.
[00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:46.640]   Well, not just that.
[00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:47.560]   Oh, Yahoo! Because it did.
[00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:49.440]   Cisco, I think, sold technology there, right?
[00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:50.040]   That's the problem.
[00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:52.960]   Yahoo did turn over information about dissidents.
[00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:56.480]   Now, you have to do that if you have that information
[00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:58.680]   within the people's problem of China, right?
[00:10:58.680 --> 00:10:59.200]   By law.
[00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:00.520]   So in a lot of ways, Google-- yeah,
[00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:03.920]   Yahoo made the mistake of actually being there
[00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:05.120]   with sensitive information.
[00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:07.680]   That was a dumb move from the beginning.
[00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:10.840]   Once you're there, you kind of have to obey the law, right?
[00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:15.520]   So-- but Cisco is far worse largely because Cisco is actively
[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:19.840]   selling the sorts of technologies that China uses to do.
[00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:21.360]   Well, it's not just the filters are a big part,
[00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:26.760]   but China's major tool for limiting
[00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:29.640]   the distribution of unsavory material
[00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:33.440]   is the surprise reset of your connection, right?
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:36.360]   So they have these ways of just blipping out people's connections
[00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:39.680]   if they end up going to bad places or places
[00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:41.160]   the Chinese government doesn't like.
[00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.400]   In general, also, the Chinese government
[00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:47.880]   makes sure that there are really, I think, only two major channels
[00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:49.080]   into the People's Republic.
[00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:51.600]   And it's very easy for them to block YouTube and block
[00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:55.680]   blogger and block any service that they can
[00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:58.440]   Facebook, which they often do, which they consider potentially
[00:11:58.440 --> 00:11:59.040]   troublesome.
[00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:00.760]   So that's how China does its thing.
[00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:03.560]   But Google, five years ago, decided to do the following.
[00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:08.120]   Google.cn would be hosted in China because you need to do that
[00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:10.200]   to get it to run at a decent speed
[00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:13.800]   and to be able to work on the linguistic challenges that
[00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:16.560]   are so important in search.
[00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:22.120]   You really need native Mandarin speakers, readers,
[00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:25.880]   computer scientists, linguists working on these problems
[00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:28.200]   and be able to mess with the code right there, right?
[00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:29.240]   So that makes sense.
[00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:33.320]   But any service that required anyone to register, log in,
[00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:36.640]   and leave a record, those services were offshore.
[00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:38.680]   Those services were on--
[00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:41.040]   held on servers-- the same servers that we have.
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:45.480]   So to get to Gmail, to Google Book Search,
[00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:50.200]   to get to Google Scholar, to get to any of those important
[00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:56.040]   services, even YouTube, where you can register,
[00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:57.680]   people in China who use these services
[00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:01.760]   would have to go to the same servers we use, which meant
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:03.480]   that occasionally they were blocked.
[00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:04.360]   But they were safe.
[00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:06.840]   The Chinese government couldn't come knocking and say,
[00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:10.520]   by the way, we want all the data and email of this person,
[00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:13.840]   the way they could do it with any such business hosted in China.
[00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:15.560]   So that worked out great.
[00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:19.720]   I think now, Google was always at a competitive disadvantage
[00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:23.080]   in China because it would not do what Baidu did, which
[00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:27.600]   is present direct, simple searches and links
[00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:29.440]   to pirated music and movies.
[00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:31.480]   That's the number one thing Baidu does.
[00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:35.040]   Baidu also takes advantage of nationalism.
[00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:37.080]   It's the homegrown web company that's
[00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:38.840]   kicking the butt of this big bad American company.
[00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:41.720]   I mean, that's a great story for the vast majority of people
[00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:45.120]   in China who are terribly supportive of the government.
[00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:49.000]   And as a result, Google found ways to make money,
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.560]   but it was slowly creeping up in the size of the market.
[00:13:53.560 --> 00:13:55.400]   But the total market was still pretty huge.
[00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:58.320]   I mean, 100 million people in a population
[00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:02.200]   where Google clearly had a much better representation
[00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:03.760]   among two very important groups.
[00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:07.080]   One, the cosmopolitan elite, the people
[00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:09.120]   who were involved in international banking,
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:11.920]   people who go to college and university in Europe
[00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:14.080]   or Canada or the United States, people
[00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:17.640]   who were interested in connecting with the outside world,
[00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:20.440]   usually for business reasons, but often
[00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:22.560]   for political reasons, religious reasons, whatever.
[00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:25.960]   Those folks tended to use Google over Baidu,
[00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:28.120]   except when they wanted to get music.
[00:14:28.120 --> 00:14:33.920]   Now, the other segment of the Chinese internet user
[00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:38.280]   population that was sort of more Google than Baidu of late
[00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:41.320]   has been younger college educated people.
[00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:43.600]   And there are more people than ever going to college now
[00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:44.360]   in China.
[00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:47.240]   So there was a sense that younger people
[00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:51.480]   found a lot of virtue in the vast array of Google services.
[00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:53.440]   As long as they were able to get to them.
[00:14:53.440 --> 00:14:55.200]   And in college, one of the first things
[00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:57.920]   you learn in college in China is how to use VPN
[00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:00.720]   and how to use proxy servers, how to use proxy servers
[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:03.080]   to get a consistent connection with Google services
[00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:06.360]   and get the thoroughly unfiltered search results anyway.
[00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:08.240]   So that's kind of what they were looking at.
[00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:11.760]   So this is by threatening to pull out of China,
[00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:14.800]   this is actually a major risk for them
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:15.760]   for a couple of reasons.
[00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:18.760]   One, it doesn't matter if they remain 30% of the market
[00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:24.120]   forever, 30% of a potential billion people
[00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:26.640]   is nothing to sneeze at.
[00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:28.840]   You can still sell a lot of ads that way.
[00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:33.200]   And maybe even a lot of phones to put some transition down.
[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:35.560]   But so that's what's really at risk here.
[00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:38.520]   So I mean, I've read a lot of blog posts from Senex saying,
[00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:40.560]   well, Google is failing and this is--
[00:15:40.560 --> 00:15:41.840]   they don't really mean anything with this
[00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:43.760]   because they're backing out because they're just--
[00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:45.040]   tail between the legs.
[00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:46.440]   They don't want to admit that they're losing.
[00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:48.080]   Well, it's not a race, right?
[00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:49.680]   Every paying customer is a paying customer.
[00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:51.960]   Every click is a click.
[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:54.640]   So they weren't necessarily losing.
[00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:57.080]   But of course, they would love to be the dominant search
[00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:58.200]   engine in any market.
[00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:00.160]   It just wasn't going to happen any time in the next decade.
[00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:01.840]   But whatever.
[00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:05.760]   The reason that this is important in a larger sense
[00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:11.120]   is that Google is making a stand for the internet itself.
[00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:13.880]   But what we've discovered with-- Google revealed.
[00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:16.200]   This is the other thing that was amazing about what happened.
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:19.080]   Google is the first company to speak openly
[00:16:19.080 --> 00:16:24.240]   about that level of attacks and the level of vulnerability
[00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:25.080]   that's true.
[00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:29.320]   And people who are involved in web security and server security
[00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:31.720]   have known this secret for a long time
[00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:33.280]   that nothing is really secure.
[00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:37.400]   Now, think about the anxiety going through the room
[00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:41.320]   as the top 10 people at Google discuss this issue.
[00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:45.680]   Are we willing to explain to the world not really secure?
[00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:48.000]   That Google Docs is not really secure.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.240]   We already saw the Twitter hacking event with Google Docs
[00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:52.080]   sort of demonstrate that.
[00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:55.480]   So they're risking eroding the perception
[00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:59.400]   that they have been trying to put forth in their gamble
[00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:00.440]   on cloud computing.
[00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:03.480]   They're putting cloud computing at risk as well as that huge
[00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:05.200]   Chinese market by this move.
[00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:07.200]   The reason they're doing this is they
[00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:12.960]   find their current state of practice and environment
[00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:14.600]   in China untenable.
[00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:21.840]   They can't stand for this level of aggressive intrusion
[00:17:21.840 --> 00:17:23.120]   into their security.
[00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:24.920]   That's just not the sort of thing that would happen.
[00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:27.360]   Because imagine if they hadn't announced this,
[00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:30.080]   imagine if they hadn't gone public with this vulnerability.
[00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:35.720]   And 30, 60 days from now, some political dissonant gets arrested
[00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:38.440]   and they come to his door with all his Gmail's.
[00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:40.280]   All his Gmail mail.
[00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:44.720]   At that point, Google becomes as big a sinner, if not bigger,
[00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:46.120]   than Yahoo was for giving up that.
[00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:49.440]   And also, none of us trusts our Gmail with Google.
[00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:50.160]   That's right.
[00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:51.520]   None of us trusts our--
[00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:54.440]   So if that happens, if they hadn't gotten ahead of this
[00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:57.880]   and taken this stand, they knew they were risking
[00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:01.880]   monumental embarrassment both within China and worldwide.
[00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:04.160]   Already, Google's taken a number of important reputation
[00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:04.760]   hits.
[00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:07.000]   They could not afford that kind of tragedy.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:10.160]   Nor did they want the blood of anybody.
[00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:10.720]   I mean, nobody wants--
[00:18:10.720 --> 00:18:14.400]   Like, a drastic to Microsoft's response, which was essentially--
[00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:16.000]   No, I don't think--
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:16.680]   What's the problem?
[00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:18.360]   I don't think we're being hacked.
[00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:19.120]   Or are we being hacked?
[00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:19.620]   Oh, my gosh.
[00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:22.000]   If we want to do this week in Microsoft, just a whole fact.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.400]   I don't think we're being hacked.
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:25.800]   I don't think we're being hacked.
[00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:30.760]   Microsoft is just so dumb in this entire Microsoft.
[00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:34.360]   But here's where Google really, by planning a flag in the sand,
[00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:37.800]   drawing a line in the sand, says, come on Microsoft and Yahoo,
[00:18:37.800 --> 00:18:38.880]   put up or shut up now.
[00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:41.440]   And other American corporations--
[00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:43.000]   I don't know if I'd go so far as to say,
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.160]   Google now has a foreign policy.
[00:18:45.160 --> 00:18:48.080]   In fact, in some ways, you could say this is a fit of peak.
[00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:50.840]   They talk about in the Computer World article,
[00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:54.040]   which is a great article about a Christmas Eve meeting
[00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:58.880]   that Larry Page led to discuss this.
[00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:02.680]   And the reaction was, holy crap, the malware
[00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:06.000]   is accessing our internal intercept system.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.080]   And I think the first reaction from people
[00:19:08.080 --> 00:19:11.960]   like Larry and engineers is, screw you, China.
[00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:14.000]   You know, I mean, I could kind of understand that.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:15.080]   Well, I think it was right.
[00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:17.160]   I think we're all sensey, but as usual,
[00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:19.320]   we don't disagree as much as it appears,
[00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:24.120]   that the new world here is the internet,
[00:19:24.120 --> 00:19:27.160]   and Google is what?
[00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:27.600]   Great Britain.
[00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:28.600]   Well, yeah, so my--
[00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:29.120]   It's my fault.
[00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:29.880]   --it's the politics of this.
[00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:31.400]   And it's the protector of this.
[00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:33.560]   And I want to go back to one point you said before,
[00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:35.520]   those of you who I think where we do disagree,
[00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:37.520]   is on the idea of corporate responsibility.
[00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:41.240]   I just put up on the wiki piece by Umer Haik
[00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:43.960]   at the Harvard Business School blog, where Umer has been
[00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:48.440]   arguing very eloquently that basically Google's
[00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:51.440]   Don't Be Evil case, that is a business strategy today,
[00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:53.960]   that in an age when we can all talk about a company,
[00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:57.040]   in an instant, doing evil is bad business.
[00:19:57.040 --> 00:20:00.000]   But it also begs the question why they've done--
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.960]   why they've been there for four years.
[00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:03.520]   That's exactly it, right.
[00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:04.480]   They've always-- they've always--
[00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:05.480]   I think that is good marketing.
[00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:05.880]   --not happy about it.
[00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:07.680]   And Britain supposedly is not going to be about it.
[00:20:07.680 --> 00:20:10.160]   And so this is-- I think the argument
[00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:12.080]   that this is really about the cyber attacks,
[00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:14.320]   the convenient way to bring up a censorship
[00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:17.920]   and also try to make that the issue is a nice--
[00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:19.160]   So it gave them a hook.
[00:20:19.160 --> 00:20:20.760]   It gave them a hook to do something they should have done
[00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:21.800]   four years ago.
[00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:23.840]   OK, I mean, I don't want to argue too much about this.
[00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:26.400]   But look, basically, I don't buy that there
[00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:28.680]   was a free speech motivation at the core of this,
[00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:32.960]   because Google could have made a similar move
[00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:35.960]   in early December 2009, if it really
[00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:36.800]   were about free speech.
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:40.400]   It could have made it in 2007, if it were about free speech.
[00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:45.040]   No, it was really about the fact that the security
[00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:47.640]   and integrity of the internet and e-commerce
[00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:49.240]   is directly threatened by this.
[00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:50.320]   That's what it felt like.
[00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:50.720]   It's like--
[00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:51.720]   --cloons free speech.
[00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:53.640]   Yeah, but it looked like to me, it's
[00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:55.120]   like, well, we can deal with these guys
[00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:57.160]   until they start stealing stuff from us.
[00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:59.280]   OK, now they've gone too far.
[00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:00.280]   Exactly.
[00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:04.280]   But putting that aside, the real challenge--
[00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:08.080]   I tried to imagine what they want out of this, right?
[00:21:08.080 --> 00:21:10.480]   First of all, it's a total bluff.
[00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:12.280]   And maybe even--
[00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:13.240]   Oh, it's a total bluff.
[00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:13.800]   That's all I wanted to know.
[00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:14.880]   You think there's an expectation--
[00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:16.800]   they have an expectation that China might change its law
[00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:17.480]   and allow them to--
[00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:18.160]   No, no, no, no.
[00:21:18.160 --> 00:21:20.160]   Listen, it's not a total bluff that they'll pull out of China.
[00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:23.200]   It's a total bluff that they will run an unfiltered,
[00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:27.600]   uncensored web search project in China in Google.cn.
[00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:29.400]   It's absolutely a total bluff.
[00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:30.680]   Let me clarify this, though.
[00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:32.480]   They're not yet doing that.
[00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:33.120]   What they--
[00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:33.680]   No, exactly.
[00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:35.960]   What they said in the blog post is,
[00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:37.640]   we're going to give you two choices, China.
[00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:40.520]   You either change the law so that we can run an unfiltered
[00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:42.800]   search, or we leave.
[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:44.480]   And you say that there's no--
[00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:45.560]   that first choice is not even.
[00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:46.400]   It's a total bluff.
[00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:49.120]   And so it was weird, because the first day that this broke,
[00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:50.800]   there were all sorts of people tweeting and blogging
[00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:53.680]   about the fact that, oh, now you can see Tankman on Google.cn.
[00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:54.160]   No, you can't.
[00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:55.080]   I never looked for it.
[00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:55.640]   I don't know.
[00:21:55.640 --> 00:21:56.480]   But the point was--
[00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:58.320]   You can if you're searching from within the US.
[00:21:58.320 --> 00:21:58.880]   But it's simply--
[00:21:58.880 --> 00:21:59.720]   Exactly, right.
[00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:02.160]   But so they haven't uncensored anything.
[00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:04.040]   And they're not going to, because the moment that they go
[00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:10.000]   censor free, that's the point at which Chinese soldiers arrest
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.200]   every Google employee in the office.
[00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:14.840]   Do we know if that office is still open,
[00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:16.640]   they have the beautiful new offices in Beijing.
[00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:17.720]   Is that office still open?
[00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:20.440]   Do employees do believe?
[00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:22.120]   Yeah, I saw it on TechCrunch.
[00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:23.120]   You could take it or leave it.
[00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:24.520]   It was on TechCrunch.
[00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:28.920]   Google had given them the long weekend, the MLK weekend off.
[00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:29.680]   And--
[00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:32.000]   Now a lot of them have to be Chinese citizens,
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.640]   which means they're not going anywhere.
[00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:35.240]   Right, right.
[00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:37.280]   But still, you don't want to keep everybody in one place
[00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:41.280]   where it's easy to confiscate all the computers, all the servers,
[00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:45.240]   all the logs, and all the people at the same time.
[00:22:45.240 --> 00:22:47.160]   You may want to make it a little bit more challenging.
[00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:51.120]   But basically, Google does not want to put its employees at risk.
[00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:55.320]   Google does not want to put its infrastructure at risk.
[00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:57.960]   It is willing to put its revenue at risk.
[00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:00.040]   And because there's a bigger battle to be fought here.
[00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:03.040]   Now what Google would like with this threat to pull out
[00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:03.920]   is two things.
[00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:07.240]   One, that class of Google users who deeply love Google--
[00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:09.120]   and there's a story in the New York Times,
[00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:12.080]   I think, coming out tomorrow, sort of interviewing
[00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:14.520]   the number of these people, the educated elites,
[00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:17.200]   the folks who are really sort of deeply
[00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:20.800]   into all the different Google products--
[00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:24.840]   Google's hoping that there is some sort of, dare we say,
[00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:28.280]   rising political sensibility attached to this.
[00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:30.360]   I really doubt that people love Google enough
[00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:31.960]   to put their lives at risk.
[00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:35.160]   And I really doubt that China is liberal enough today
[00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:37.440]   to even create space for that.
[00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:41.000]   Nonetheless, seeding that dissatisfaction
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.680]   can be really important over the long run.
[00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:46.360]   But more importantly, I think Google desperately
[00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:50.200]   wanted to force the hand of Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama,
[00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:54.640]   and various European leaders so that they stand up and say,
[00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:55.680]   you know what?
[00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:58.440]   China's activities in this area are threatening
[00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:01.600]   a major area of global commerce and a major segment
[00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:04.080]   of the European and American economy.
[00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:07.320]   And the trust that we all hope to have in the internet
[00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:10.040]   in the future, that is major.
[00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:14.120]   And because so far the United States government,
[00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:17.480]   under Obama, has been meek dealing with China,
[00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:20.280]   not willing to challenge them on a number of issues,
[00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:22.200]   I think Google felt it didn't have a choice,
[00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:23.720]   even though Eric Smith could pick up the phone
[00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:25.640]   and talk to the president, it didn't have a choice
[00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:26.640]   without going public.
[00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:29.080]   - Well, isn't Secretary Clinton speaking on Thursday on this?
[00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:30.640]   I mean, isn't that--
[00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:33.640]   - Well, it was gonna be a fuzzy speech about internet freedom,
[00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:35.880]   blah, blah, blah, you know, flowers and puppies.
[00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:38.680]   But now it actually has to be grounded in something
[00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:41.760]   that directly takes on the Chinese government.
[00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:43.400]   And that is big.
[00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:46.120]   - And they did already say, you know,
[00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:47.760]   hands off or whatever I can.
[00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:48.600]   - Exactly.
[00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:50.600]   - Get your fingers out of our servers.
[00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:52.360]   - Google succeeded in making sure
[00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:54.200]   that the United States government is on record
[00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:55.880]   about this issue and is taking it seriously.
[00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:57.760]   - She does say that the State Department
[00:24:57.760 --> 00:24:58.880]   was briefed by Google.
[00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:02.280]   So they're, you know, Google has access.
[00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:04.280]   - And I'm sure there's much more going on behind the scenes
[00:25:04.280 --> 00:25:05.600]   that we'll never know about.
[00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:07.800]   - Here's the quote from Secretary Clinton.
[00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:09.400]   She says, "We look to the Chinese government
[00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:10.560]   for an explanation.
[00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:12.160]   Those are, that's harsh words.
[00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:14.800]   The ability to cooperate with confidence in cyberspace
[00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:18.800]   is critical in a modern society and economy."
[00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:19.800]   She said-- - We didn't say this
[00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:21.640]   about, you know, dangerous products
[00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:22.640]   that were killing people.
[00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:23.480]   - Yeah, lay it.
[00:25:23.480 --> 00:25:24.320]   - No.
[00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:25.400]   - At least Andy and I will put you--
[00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:27.600]   - That was a different Secretary of State.
[00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:28.640]   So, yeah, let's put it--
[00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:29.480]   - That's true.
[00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:32.600]   - That's a funny thing, Jim Fallows says,
[00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:36.200]   is that China's entering its Bush-Cheney era.
[00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:41.200]   In which they're pissing off their foreign allies
[00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:42.720]   with their policy.
[00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:43.560]   - Well, but not for the first time,
[00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:45.480]   but let's also remember, I mean,
[00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:47.040]   Jeff and I had this really neat,
[00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:49.480]   so back and forth on our blogs about this notion
[00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:52.320]   of the extent to which Google is behaving like a state.
[00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:55.040]   But so historically though, let's be clear,
[00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:57.880]   this isn't radically new that British East India Company
[00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:00.000]   acted like a state, you know,
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.040]   and basically colonized India and Indonesia.
[00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:05.240]   The Dutch East India Company, I'm sorry,
[00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:08.080]   colonized Indonesia the same way, right?
[00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:10.760]   Acted like a state with many of the powers of the state,
[00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:15.080]   you know, employing privateers to do warfare,
[00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:17.040]   to actually go, you know, and lots of,
[00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:20.200]   you know, basically raising their own private armies
[00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:21.640]   to do these sorts of activities.
[00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:24.280]   So it's not new that companies,
[00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:27.040]   multinational companies doing work around the globe
[00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:29.720]   have foreign policies and actually military policies.
[00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:33.120]   So that's actually been a longstanding thing.
[00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:35.360]   You know, when Rockefeller ran Standard Oil,
[00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:37.760]   he had a foreign policy as he went
[00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:39.840]   beyond North America looking for oil.
[00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:42.360]   Today ExxonMobil has a foreign policy
[00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:43.680]   and many of them in fact.
[00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:45.480]   So none of that's radically new.
[00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:48.240]   Coca-Cola of course has its own version of foreign policy,
[00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:50.680]   one that's light enough we don't even notice.
[00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:53.280]   So that's not necessarily the new thing.
[00:26:53.280 --> 00:26:56.720]   The interesting thing about Google is that
[00:26:56.720 --> 00:27:00.680]   because so many of the challenges of sort of
[00:27:00.680 --> 00:27:05.360]   raining in or maybe civilizing or making the internet
[00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:08.760]   work well for everyday people,
[00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:11.720]   those challenges, fighting spyware, fighting malware,
[00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:15.440]   making sure that the cacophony of information
[00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:18.720]   available out there is usable and navigable.
[00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:20.720]   These are questions of governance
[00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:24.040]   and because no state or group of states
[00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:28.440]   or coalition of states is either authorized or capable
[00:27:28.440 --> 00:27:30.440]   of engaging in this level of governance.
[00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:31.840]   - Or trusted to.
[00:27:31.840 --> 00:27:32.680]   - Or trusted to.
[00:27:32.680 --> 00:27:35.040]   Google is filling that vacuum.
[00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:36.400]   - So you say it's super international.
[00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:37.240]   - Yeah.
[00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:38.240]   - It's essentially the thing about it,
[00:27:38.240 --> 00:27:40.280]   what it's said is it's the governance of the internet.
[00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:43.680]   And some may get uncomfortable with that wording,
[00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:44.920]   but I think he's right.
[00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:45.920]   I think that that's-
[00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:47.800]   - I can't get away from the notion though
[00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:51.920]   that Google didn't care until their servers were broken into.
[00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:53.280]   - Well they compared.
[00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:54.360]   - But they did care.
[00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:57.360]   There was an argument going on inside the company.
[00:27:57.360 --> 00:27:59.280]   The word is, and I have no inside knowledge on this,
[00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:00.480]   but the word is that Sergey Brin
[00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:02.040]   has been uncomfortable since the first.
[00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:05.040]   I linked to a quote of his in 2006
[00:28:05.040 --> 00:28:06.320]   and was clearly uncomfortable.
[00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:09.760]   - It's clear, but that's good PR.
[00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:11.920]   Well, one of our principles is uncomfortable.
[00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:13.720]   We're still gonna do it.
[00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:17.000]   - Even if it's true, even if it's true, it doesn't matter.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.080]   What really matters is effects in the real world.
[00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:20.640]   So William James said,
[00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:22.960]   "A belief is that upon which you are willing to act."
[00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:23.800]   - Yes.
[00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:25.160]   - And basically Google was-
[00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:27.200]   - For four years, not one act on it.
[00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:30.760]   So that's why I am a little suspect of the whole thing.
[00:28:30.760 --> 00:28:32.000]   I applaud them.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.600]   I think one of the reasons they're doing it
[00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:35.680]   is because to the outside world
[00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:38.640]   where there's mounting suspicion of Google,
[00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:41.560]   they needed some way to say, oh look, see?
[00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:42.680]   - Well they needed virtue.
[00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:44.040]   - They needed virtue.
[00:28:44.040 --> 00:28:47.360]   But the timing's very convenient for that.
[00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:50.080]   - I think that's truly over the same way.
[00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:51.320]   Again, Yahoo hasn't done it,
[00:28:51.320 --> 00:28:53.120]   Microsoft hasn't done it, Cisco hasn't done it.
[00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:54.680]   - No, it's the right thing to do.
[00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:56.360]   - I'm not saying it's not the right thing to do.
[00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:58.840]   I'm saying it was the right thing to do four years ago.
[00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:00.680]   And I understand the need, look, if you're eBay,
[00:29:00.680 --> 00:29:03.160]   you don't sell Nazi memorabilia in Germany.
[00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:04.880]   Whether you agree with that law or not,
[00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:06.800]   you have to follow the laws of the nation.
[00:29:06.800 --> 00:29:08.920]   So the choice is not whether to do it or not.
[00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:11.280]   The choice is whether to participate
[00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:12.360]   in that country's economy.
[00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:14.600]   And that's where I think maybe
[00:29:14.600 --> 00:29:16.520]   Google could have said four years ago no.
[00:29:16.520 --> 00:29:18.800]   And I think that would have had equal power
[00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:19.880]   and would have put challenge,
[00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:22.760]   the same kind of challenge to Yahoo and Microsoft then.
[00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:24.800]   - Leo, that's--
[00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:29.200]   - What are you hearing in technology circles from people?
[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:31.000]   Is this a resonating as a big issue
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.360]   or is it more on the blather sphere?
[00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:36.080]   - I mean, I think everyone's really happy
[00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:37.560]   and excited about what happened.
[00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:40.080]   I mean, I think that I too am stuck like Leo
[00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:41.520]   on this idea that they made the announcement
[00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:46.080]   after realizing the attacks and the surveillance.
[00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:49.600]   I mean, I think that this is very much like a geek ego thing.
[00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:53.840]   Google can stand the idea that they were hacked
[00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:55.520]   and that their servers were in a building somewhere
[00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:57.080]   in China and possibly wiretapped.
[00:29:57.080 --> 00:29:58.600]   I mean, then later on that week,
[00:29:58.600 --> 00:29:59.560]   I don't know if this is related,
[00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:01.040]   but it's interesting that later on that week,
[00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:03.400]   HTTPS, the encrypted version of Gmail becomes--
[00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:04.240]   - It's turned on.
[00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:06.640]   - Yeah. - Turned on by default.
[00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:08.600]   So, you know, I think that this--
[00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:09.440]   - It's about time, excuse me.
[00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:10.280]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:11.120]   - It is about time.
[00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:12.600]   It's a turn on before, but it's about time
[00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:15.480]   that it was just the default.
[00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:17.440]   So, which is interesting because security then
[00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:18.840]   becomes more important than speed
[00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:21.280]   because encryption speed is a tiny bit slower.
[00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:22.120]   You really don't feel it.
[00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:24.360]   But so, yeah, I mean, I really think
[00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:25.560]   that this was just a matter of ego.
[00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:27.240]   They couldn't swallow the idea
[00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:30.200]   that they were actually enabling, you know,
[00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:32.520]   the Chinese government to find dissidents,
[00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:36.000]   you know, and to find information about those people.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:37.320]   - And they're right, you'd be up and on.
[00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:38.720]   - And they should. - Yeah.
[00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:41.080]   - Yeah, yeah, but that's how it changed.
[00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:42.560]   I mean, that's the thing that changed the game.
[00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:43.800]   - But it's a little bit like saying,
[00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:45.400]   we're gonna do business with Nazi Germany
[00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:46.240]   selling them guns.
[00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:47.720]   Oh my goodness, they're harming Jews.
[00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:49.400]   Oh, well, we'll get out now.
[00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:52.920]   It's like, yeah, that's good now,
[00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:55.760]   but come on, what happened four years ago?
[00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:57.440]   I still don't-- - Yeah, but Leo,
[00:30:57.440 --> 00:30:59.560]   I think it is different in scale.
[00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:01.160]   It's a very different scale.
[00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:03.040]   - Well, yeah, no, I mean, people aren't getting,
[00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:04.520]   well, I don't know, maybe they are getting killed.
[00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:05.600]   I don't know. - Well, people are getting killed.
[00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:06.440]   - Let me try to see what it is.
[00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:07.440]   - Let me let Gina finish.
[00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:08.440]   Hold on, hold on a second.
[00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:09.760]   Let me let Gina finish.
[00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:12.760]   - I mean, the point that Google was attacked
[00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:14.720]   and some information was what,
[00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:16.040]   there was a security breach
[00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:17.720]   is a big threat to their business, right?
[00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:19.280]   I mean, they wanna convince the whole world
[00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:21.640]   that storing your information on the cloud is secure.
[00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:23.360]   So here's an example when it wasn't,
[00:31:23.360 --> 00:31:24.760]   for whatever reasons.
[00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:27.280]   And I think Douglas Riskoff wrote an article saying
[00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:29.440]   that this was a PR move to cover up
[00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:30.520]   what was a security breach.
[00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:32.600]   And I think I've said this in past shows,
[00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:36.120]   all Google needs is one major, well publicized security breach
[00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:39.120]   to step back their cloud business years and years.
[00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:40.920]   Why wasn't this it?
[00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:44.040]   - Well, this wasn't it because they turned it into,
[00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:46.360]   you know, what could be perceived as a brilliant PR move.
[00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:48.960]   - Riskoff calls it the great Google cover up.
[00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:50.120]   - Yes.
[00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:51.640]   So you have lots of people cheering them on,
[00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:53.280]   yay, Google's doing the right thing.
[00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:54.320]   But you know, they're still,
[00:31:54.320 --> 00:31:56.680]   they got it to people's Gmail accounts.
[00:31:56.680 --> 00:31:57.520]   - Right.
[00:31:57.520 --> 00:31:58.360]   - What is that?
[00:31:58.360 --> 00:31:59.200]   - What is that?
[00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:00.040]   - What is that?
[00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:00.880]   - It's not a bad thing.
[00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:01.720]   I agree with you.
[00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:02.560]   I think that what was, I think Siva is right.
[00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:05.480]   And I think you agree with him that the cloud was at risk.
[00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:09.760]   Google was at risk, the internet was at risk,
[00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:10.920]   and who was doing it?
[00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:15.920]   A regime dictator, a tyrannical dictator that's been putting out
[00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:19.720]   products that kill people, killing people for their views
[00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:20.840]   and prisoning for their views.
[00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:21.920]   And we never stood up.
[00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:22.760]   Why?
[00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:24.120]   Because we're all so damn greedy,
[00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:26.480]   we don't want to pass up the market.
[00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:27.320]   - Right.
[00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:28.600]   - And so, you know, yes, Leo,
[00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:29.920]   they should have done it four years ago.
[00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:33.480]   I said it at the time, I've said it since.
[00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:35.080]   Sometimes we all have to make mistakes
[00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:36.600]   and then come to our damn senses.
[00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:38.720]   And I'm glad somebody did.
[00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:39.560]   - Yeah.
[00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:40.880]   - I think we're all applauding Google
[00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:42.520]   for coming to their senses.
[00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:46.680]   - I would say though, that Google was not complicit
[00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:50.840]   in the imprisoning of anyone, the exploitation of anyone,
[00:32:50.840 --> 00:32:52.040]   the murderer of anyone.
[00:32:52.040 --> 00:32:54.760]   - Unlike Yahoo.
[00:32:54.760 --> 00:32:55.760]   - Unlike Yahoo.
[00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:57.400]   And Google was careful about that.
[00:32:57.400 --> 00:33:00.640]   And not only because it's their human beings
[00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:02.200]   and who would really want to,
[00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:04.120]   unless you want to absolve yourself of all responsibility.
[00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:08.280]   But more than that, they also knew that at post Yahoo,
[00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:13.280]   it was an impossible business relationship to do
[00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:14.800]   on those same terms,
[00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:17.000]   to keep the sensitive information on China,
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:19.640]   just in China, it just would have been madness.
[00:33:19.640 --> 00:33:22.520]   So they learned a lot from what Yahoo did.
[00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:25.760]   So I think that it would have been corporate malpractice,
[00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:27.600]   not to do business in China.
[00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:30.640]   Every major American company does business in China.
[00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:33.680]   Nike employs people in sweatshops in China.
[00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:35.160]   - Hey, every iPod we've got,
[00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:37.720]   and probably this Google phone is made in China.
[00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:38.560]   - Exactly.
[00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:40.320]   Look, if you have a problem,
[00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:42.080]   this is one of the big arguments in my book,
[00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:46.000]   and the other side of the corporate responsibility,
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:50.760]   dismissal is basically corporations are legally bound
[00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:54.240]   to basically be immoral, to be amoral,
[00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:59.240]   to be interested in the interests of their stockholders
[00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:02.680]   and period, right, basically period.
[00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:05.520]   - So do you read an archaic on that, Siva?
[00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:06.360]   - I'm sorry.
[00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:07.800]   - O'Bor says, O'Bor's argument is,
[00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:10.080]   O'Bor's argument is that, again,
[00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:13.240]   now that we can all talk about a company in a flash,
[00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:16.360]   that being evil is gonna affect your business,
[00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:18.680]   that it becomes part of your enlightened self-interest.
[00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:19.520]   - That's right.
[00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:20.360]   - And that being good.
[00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:21.200]   - I don't disagree with that at all.
[00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:22.480]   - You have a fiduciary responsibility
[00:34:22.480 --> 00:34:24.320]   to your stakeholders to be a good company.
[00:34:24.320 --> 00:34:25.320]   - And don't disagree at all,
[00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:26.840]   but what that deflates, he agrees with me,
[00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:28.400]   'cause what that deflates is a sense
[00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:31.600]   that corporate responsibility is somehow distinct
[00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:33.640]   from self-interest.
[00:34:33.640 --> 00:34:36.320]   - And maybe that's what this is a manifestation of.
[00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:40.240]   Now, Rushkoff raises a specter that I think is important,
[00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:42.320]   which is we don't know how much Google
[00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:44.400]   was cooperating with China.
[00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:47.280]   - I think Rushkoff's full of crap for a couple of reasons.
[00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:49.440]   Generally, he's on the bubble battle.
[00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:52.520]   First of all, he gets completely wrong,
[00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:54.480]   a major fact in his piece.
[00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:57.400]   One, he says that Google has servers
[00:34:57.400 --> 00:34:59.480]   with sensitive information within the People's Republic
[00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:01.560]   of China, that is absolutely not true.
[00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:06.400]   And that was the key to Google strategy five years ago.
[00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:09.400]   Nobody would be stupid enough to defy the policy
[00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:12.160]   as outlined to Congress under oath, right?
[00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:14.040]   About this sort of thing.
[00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:15.840]   So that was absolutely untrue.
[00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:20.640]   Rushkoff's also surmising that Google's close interaction
[00:35:20.640 --> 00:35:23.760]   with the government created these vulnerabilities.
[00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:26.240]   What we've seen from the security researchers so far,
[00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:29.460]   and we've had very little clarity on this,
[00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:34.460]   was that basically the vulnerabilities were surprise,
[00:35:34.460 --> 00:35:38.480]   Microsoft Internet Explorer vulnerabilities,
[00:35:38.480 --> 00:35:40.640]   which, you know, it works.
[00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:44.000]   And maybe to some degree, some Adobe PDF vulnerabilities.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:45.160]   Again, not a surprise.
[00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:48.040]   - That was for the human rights activist worldwide
[00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:48.880]   who got hacked.
[00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:50.840]   Was that for Google as well?
[00:35:50.840 --> 00:35:52.120]   - Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[00:35:52.120 --> 00:35:54.240]   So, you know, they're just, I mean,
[00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:57.120]   but again, we don't know exactly, well, okay, I don't know.
[00:35:57.120 --> 00:35:58.720]   I don't know when nobody knows for sure.
[00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:01.980]   But in addition, a lot of these vulnerabilities,
[00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:04.220]   a lot of sort of back doors in a lot of these systems
[00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:07.420]   are actually required under US law
[00:36:07.420 --> 00:36:11.500]   to allow the NSA and the FBI into back doors.
[00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:14.200]   Again, not very well expressed or understood.
[00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:17.700]   So in a lot of ways, the government we tend to trust
[00:36:17.700 --> 00:36:20.660]   helps make a lot of these servers insecure
[00:36:20.660 --> 00:36:22.580]   and open some potential vulnerabilities.
[00:36:22.580 --> 00:36:23.660]   That's one possibility.
[00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:26.380]   But saying that Google basically was in bed
[00:36:26.380 --> 00:36:29.100]   with the Chinese government,
[00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:34.100]   it requires either a complete invocation of a falsehood,
[00:36:34.100 --> 00:36:38.220]   which is what he did, or a reaction
[00:36:38.220 --> 00:36:39.800]   to the absence of evidence, right?
[00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:40.640]   The absence of evidence.
[00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:42.820]   - No, it's pure speculation, obviously.
[00:36:42.820 --> 00:36:43.820]   It's pure speculation.
[00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:45.300]   - Yeah, but it raises, I mean, I don't know
[00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:46.140]   if it's a response.
[00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:47.580]   I think it raises an interesting point.
[00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:48.420]   We don't know.
[00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:52.020]   - Well, it's worse because without any evidence
[00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:55.980]   to, I remember during the Iraq war,
[00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:58.980]   there were bloggers who were in Iraq
[00:36:58.980 --> 00:37:00.700]   who were in favor of US policy.
[00:37:00.700 --> 00:37:01.980]   They've all actually switched around,
[00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:03.100]   but at the time they were.
[00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:04.620]   And there were people who went on the air
[00:37:04.620 --> 00:37:07.940]   who speculated they were CIA with absolutely no evidence
[00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:09.660]   and could have killed them as a result.
[00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:10.500]   - Right.
[00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:11.740]   - And I think that it is just plain,
[00:37:11.740 --> 00:37:15.780]   I mean, as a journalist, it is just plain irresponsible.
[00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:17.460]   - Well, is it on the basis of a,
[00:37:17.460 --> 00:37:19.940]   gee, I guess, to then come to all these conclusions?
[00:37:19.940 --> 00:37:21.660]   - But is it irresponsible to point out,
[00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:22.980]   and I won't go as far as Doug,
[00:37:22.980 --> 00:37:25.420]   but is it irresponsible to point out that
[00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:28.140]   we don't really know to what degree you can't?
[00:37:28.140 --> 00:37:28.980]   - Just for the negative.
[00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:32.940]   We don't really know that Google didn't cause--
[00:37:32.940 --> 00:37:35.020]   - Well, but everybody's assuming--
[00:37:35.020 --> 00:37:37.100]   - Show me proof to be the Google didn't cause it.
[00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:37.940]   - No, I understand.
[00:37:37.940 --> 00:37:38.780]   You can't prove a negative.
[00:37:38.780 --> 00:37:41.100]   But everybody's assuming that Google,
[00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:44.540]   you know, kept China at arm's length,
[00:37:44.540 --> 00:37:47.460]   but we don't know how,
[00:37:47.460 --> 00:37:49.540]   whether they did or not, do we?
[00:37:49.540 --> 00:37:50.380]   I mean--
[00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:51.780]   - So we know for sure that there were no Google servers
[00:37:51.780 --> 00:37:54.020]   in China, even just serving search results.
[00:37:54.020 --> 00:37:55.100]   - Well, as Siva was saying,
[00:37:55.100 --> 00:37:57.180]   there were some servers there.
[00:37:57.180 --> 00:37:58.380]   - There were some servers there.
[00:37:58.380 --> 00:37:59.540]   That's what you're saying, Siva.
[00:37:59.540 --> 00:38:01.380]   - But only for search, only for Siva.
[00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:02.220]   - Only for Siva.
[00:38:02.220 --> 00:38:03.780]   - Because the email was here.
[00:38:03.780 --> 00:38:04.620]   - Right.
[00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:05.460]   - Right, Siva.
[00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:06.740]   - So Gmail was kept here.
[00:38:06.740 --> 00:38:07.580]   - So Gmail was here.
[00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:09.500]   Any apps that you'd design into access and use
[00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:11.260]   were located in like Texas, right?
[00:38:11.260 --> 00:38:13.740]   But there were some search servers in China.
[00:38:13.740 --> 00:38:16.060]   See, I thought that Doug was saying that China,
[00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:17.500]   because there were servers in China,
[00:38:17.500 --> 00:38:19.140]   even the ones just serving search results,
[00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:21.980]   that they could have been just, you know,
[00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:23.340]   tapped the wires and washed the--
[00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:24.180]   - Well, here's what we don't know.
[00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:27.260]   You know as a programmer and as a geek,
[00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:30.140]   that those servers were certainly connected
[00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:31.700]   to Google servers in the States
[00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:33.180]   and could have provided a portal
[00:38:33.180 --> 00:38:34.660]   to those servers in the States.
[00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:35.500]   We don't know.
[00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:38.780]   We don't have any information about what happened, really.
[00:38:38.780 --> 00:38:39.620]   - Right.
[00:38:39.620 --> 00:38:40.460]   - We just don't know.
[00:38:40.460 --> 00:38:43.860]   And you have to trust Google to tell us what happened.
[00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:46.420]   And let's be honest, when a bank gets broken into,
[00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:48.420]   they don't tell you what happened.
[00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:49.860]   - Not until they close it up.
[00:38:49.860 --> 00:38:50.700]   (laughs)
[00:38:50.700 --> 00:38:51.780]   - Until it's done.
[00:38:51.780 --> 00:38:53.700]   So we don't know, but you're right.
[00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:54.660]   You can't prove the negatives.
[00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:56.580]   So I don't, I think maybe it's irresponsible
[00:38:56.580 --> 00:38:59.620]   to promulgate a conspiracy theory,
[00:38:59.620 --> 00:39:03.620]   but I'm just, I'm not convinced by Google at this point.
[00:39:03.620 --> 00:39:06.740]   It seems like there, it was more of a fit of peak
[00:39:06.740 --> 00:39:08.060]   because they got hacked into
[00:39:08.060 --> 00:39:10.940]   than any commitment to human rights.
[00:39:10.940 --> 00:39:13.860]   And I think the timing is very convenient for Google.
[00:39:13.860 --> 00:39:15.660]   It gives them a chance to say,
[00:39:15.660 --> 00:39:16.980]   look, see how good we are.
[00:39:16.980 --> 00:39:20.020]   It distracts from the fundamental issue of how secure they are.
[00:39:20.020 --> 00:39:20.860]   - Well, put it another way, Leo.
[00:39:20.860 --> 00:39:21.700]   - They are.
[00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:22.700]   Look at another way then.
[00:39:22.700 --> 00:39:25.260]   If it's fine, then Google could not criticize,
[00:39:25.260 --> 00:39:27.420]   attack China for the attacks
[00:39:27.420 --> 00:39:29.220]   and hold China to a more than 100.
[00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:30.220]   - They can't.
[00:39:30.220 --> 00:39:32.700]   - They can't and not bring up censorship.
[00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:35.980]   In that sense, Google was forced to bring up censorship.
[00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:37.500]   Because if they turned around and said,
[00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:39.500]   "Nasty, nasty you Chinese.
[00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:41.500]   "How dare you do this?"
[00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:43.940]   The response kind of, A, they have no proof.
[00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:46.300]   So you're in a rush-craft territory.
[00:39:46.300 --> 00:39:50.420]   And B, he puts them in a delicate ethical position
[00:39:50.420 --> 00:39:54.620]   because they are conspiring with the Chinese
[00:39:54.620 --> 00:39:56.940]   to the extent of censoring results.
[00:39:56.940 --> 00:40:00.700]   - But censoring, I just got a tweet from Simon at Illuminaunt
[00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:05.500]   who puts up a link I will put up on the wiki saying
[00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:08.780]   that here's evidence that the Tiananmen Square stuff
[00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:11.820]   was up on a Google.cn search on 15th.
[00:40:11.820 --> 00:40:15.420]   - Simon's in our chatroom and says that he has,
[00:40:15.420 --> 00:40:18.180]   he's coming in from the US IP address,
[00:40:18.180 --> 00:40:19.780]   but he says that he has employees in China
[00:40:19.780 --> 00:40:23.260]   and uses log me in to check those Chinese servers.
[00:40:23.260 --> 00:40:25.860]   So it's, I don't know whether you can--
[00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:26.700]   - I don't know either.
[00:40:26.700 --> 00:40:27.540]   - I don't know.
[00:40:27.540 --> 00:40:28.380]   - I don't know.
[00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:30.460]   - Well, look, stuff can appear and get indexed
[00:40:30.460 --> 00:40:34.620]   by Google.cn within a day and not get scrubbed immediately.
[00:40:34.620 --> 00:40:36.220]   That's always possible too.
[00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:38.700]   There are lots of different ways things can happen,
[00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:39.540]   can pop up.
[00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:41.940]   - I saw, I too saw these images from Google.cn
[00:40:41.940 --> 00:40:44.100]   that showed the protester and so forth,
[00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:44.940]   but you just don't know.
[00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:46.540]   - But I think it's, I need to make two points.
[00:40:46.540 --> 00:40:51.540]   One search result censorship is trivial.
[00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:53.060]   That's not the sort of censorship
[00:40:53.060 --> 00:40:57.020]   that really makes a difference in people's lives.
[00:40:57.020 --> 00:40:59.780]   Most of the folks who want illicit material,
[00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:02.140]   whether it's pornography or Falun Gong material
[00:41:02.140 --> 00:41:06.940]   or democratic activists, they are going to use proxy servers,
[00:41:06.940 --> 00:41:09.300]   use VPN, they're gonna find ways to do it.
[00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:10.740]   It's not hard to do.
[00:41:10.740 --> 00:41:15.020]   The knowledge is easy to get once you're in those groups.
[00:41:15.020 --> 00:41:16.820]   Now, it's nice, it's much better,
[00:41:16.820 --> 00:41:19.780]   makes us feel better as narcissistic westerners
[00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:24.020]   to think that free speech is gonna change the world instantly.
[00:41:24.020 --> 00:41:27.940]   But in fact, what really matters is the flesh and bones
[00:41:27.940 --> 00:41:31.460]   issue the fact that China tortures people
[00:41:31.460 --> 00:41:33.740]   and prisons people without charge.
[00:41:33.740 --> 00:41:36.860]   And that, the real human body's at risk.
[00:41:36.860 --> 00:41:39.300]   That's what the human rights question was.
[00:41:39.300 --> 00:41:41.940]   And ultimately what the real threat
[00:41:41.940 --> 00:41:43.820]   to and by in the internet company was.
[00:41:43.820 --> 00:41:48.820]   I just saw a tweet saying, "Hey me, my Twitter address,
[00:41:48.820 --> 00:41:50.820]   "please stay off Twitch shows
[00:41:50.820 --> 00:41:53.100]   "with your garbage Republican rants."
[00:41:53.100 --> 00:41:54.900]   - Republicans, Republican.
[00:41:54.900 --> 00:41:56.220]   - Yeah, Republican.
[00:41:56.220 --> 00:41:58.500]   - Oh, I just ignore these nitwits.
[00:41:58.500 --> 00:42:01.580]   I should always warn anybody who comes on our show
[00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:02.780]   that no matter who you are,
[00:42:02.780 --> 00:42:05.500]   you will get some nitwits saying something.
[00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:06.620]   'Cause you're in public now.
[00:42:06.620 --> 00:42:10.140]   Welcome, welcome to the general public.
[00:42:10.140 --> 00:42:11.420]   They're a lovely bunch.
[00:42:11.420 --> 00:42:13.380]   I hope you enjoy them.
[00:42:13.380 --> 00:42:15.700]   - What is your Republican book coming out to?
[00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:17.180]   - Are you a Republican seva?
[00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:19.460]   Because I'm sorry, we don't allow Republicans on this show.
[00:42:19.460 --> 00:42:20.780]   - You know I'm a Republican with a small R
[00:42:20.780 --> 00:42:22.900]   and it's sort of, I have some Republican hair cut
[00:42:22.900 --> 00:42:23.900]   that's finished.
[00:42:23.900 --> 00:42:24.740]   - Yeah, right.
[00:42:24.740 --> 00:42:27.740]   - If I'd only know and I tell you.
[00:42:27.740 --> 00:42:29.660]   - Oh, wow.
[00:42:29.660 --> 00:42:31.660]   - No. - Anyway, the,
[00:42:31.660 --> 00:42:34.420]   I think the fascinating thing here, like,
[00:42:34.420 --> 00:42:36.620]   we can unpack motives, whatever.
[00:42:36.620 --> 00:42:38.020]   The fascinating thing here is,
[00:42:38.020 --> 00:42:40.260]   there's some major stuff going down here.
[00:42:40.260 --> 00:42:45.100]   We have big important companies standing up,
[00:42:45.100 --> 00:42:46.460]   at least one in the lead,
[00:42:46.460 --> 00:42:48.020]   several others joining behind,
[00:42:48.020 --> 00:42:51.380]   standing up to this dirty little secret
[00:42:51.380 --> 00:42:54.740]   that the Chinese government has been actively disrupting
[00:42:54.740 --> 00:42:58.500]   some of the core functions of the internet and of e-commerce.
[00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:01.580]   And we are going to see in the next few weeks
[00:43:01.580 --> 00:43:04.620]   whether the United States seriously
[00:43:04.620 --> 00:43:08.500]   and puts its relationship with China at risk because of it.
[00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:10.300]   And over the long term,
[00:43:10.300 --> 00:43:13.380]   we're gonna see whether the cosmopolitan elite in China
[00:43:13.380 --> 00:43:16.700]   actually can forge some sort of political identity
[00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:18.660]   because all of the big political conflicts in China
[00:43:18.660 --> 00:43:22.740]   over the past 20 years have been largely on the margins
[00:43:22.740 --> 00:43:25.980]   of China in the Western provinces with the Uighurs,
[00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:27.340]   into bat and so forth.
[00:43:27.340 --> 00:43:31.420]   We've not seen an uprising since 1989
[00:43:31.420 --> 00:43:34.540]   in places like Shanghai and Beijing.
[00:43:34.540 --> 00:43:37.300]   This wouldn't be the trigger by no means,
[00:43:37.300 --> 00:43:39.780]   as a search engine company gonna create a new demonstration,
[00:43:39.780 --> 00:43:43.940]   but a sense of political consciousness and potential
[00:43:43.940 --> 00:43:47.820]   because good things that the elites
[00:43:47.820 --> 00:43:50.660]   who have been winning so much in China
[00:43:50.660 --> 00:43:53.580]   are suddenly in danger because of the quirks
[00:43:53.580 --> 00:43:54.620]   of the Chinese government,
[00:43:54.620 --> 00:43:58.620]   that could help feed into a sense of sort of,
[00:43:58.620 --> 00:44:01.620]   middle to upper middle class political consciousness
[00:44:01.620 --> 00:44:02.460]   within China.
[00:44:02.460 --> 00:44:04.540]   - I think they're probably moderate forces.
[00:44:04.540 --> 00:44:06.460]   And I think I know there are moderate forces
[00:44:06.460 --> 00:44:11.460]   in the Chinese Politburo and there are extreme forces
[00:44:11.460 --> 00:44:14.660]   and there is a very delicate balance between them
[00:44:14.660 --> 00:44:16.700]   and something as little as this can actually shift
[00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:17.540]   those forces.
[00:44:17.540 --> 00:44:19.380]   So it might not be protests in the streets.
[00:44:19.380 --> 00:44:21.500]   It might be something that's completely invisible
[00:44:21.500 --> 00:44:24.820]   that happens in the highest ranks of government
[00:44:24.820 --> 00:44:25.660]   where the moderates.
[00:44:25.660 --> 00:44:27.540]   - It might make a huge difference.
[00:44:27.540 --> 00:44:28.380]   - It might make a huge difference.
[00:44:28.380 --> 00:44:29.220]   The moderates might say, see,
[00:44:29.220 --> 00:44:31.460]   we're running the risk of getting cut off
[00:44:31.460 --> 00:44:33.980]   from the rest of the world by this policy.
[00:44:33.980 --> 00:44:35.220]   Maybe we ought to think about it.
[00:44:35.220 --> 00:44:36.900]   - I'll tell you, when I was in China in July,
[00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:39.740]   one of the things that's really apparent in Beijing is
[00:44:39.740 --> 00:44:42.740]   that, and I talked to a lot of Chinese nationals
[00:44:42.740 --> 00:44:46.820]   about filtering of the internet and censorship and so forth.
[00:44:46.820 --> 00:44:48.180]   And they of course said, yeah,
[00:44:48.180 --> 00:44:50.140]   anybody can get around it if they want to.
[00:44:50.140 --> 00:44:51.580]   We don't really care.
[00:44:51.580 --> 00:44:52.780]   Some people said, oh, you know,
[00:44:52.780 --> 00:44:54.460]   they're mostly just filtering pornography.
[00:44:54.460 --> 00:44:55.380]   That's fine.
[00:44:55.380 --> 00:44:56.660]   And I think one of the reasons
[00:44:56.660 --> 00:44:57.940]   you don't see protests in the streets
[00:44:57.940 --> 00:45:02.060]   is there's this general sense of prosperity and progress
[00:45:02.060 --> 00:45:04.700]   right now in the cities of China.
[00:45:04.700 --> 00:45:06.420]   And I think as long as that continues,
[00:45:06.420 --> 00:45:08.460]   I think a lot of the people there feel like,
[00:45:08.460 --> 00:45:10.060]   well, we'll get there.
[00:45:10.060 --> 00:45:12.140]   And we're making progress.
[00:45:12.140 --> 00:45:13.860]   I mean, it's a lot better than it was under Mao.
[00:45:13.860 --> 00:45:16.220]   It's a lot better than it was 20 years ago.
[00:45:16.220 --> 00:45:19.660]   So maybe they're not quite so revolutionary
[00:45:19.660 --> 00:45:21.620]   as say the people in Iran.
[00:45:21.620 --> 00:45:24.940]   - Gina, what we've learned so far about the,
[00:45:24.940 --> 00:45:25.980]   this is a question for Regina,
[00:45:25.980 --> 00:45:29.100]   for the other attacks on other companies.
[00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:31.100]   Was China just going after dissidents
[00:45:31.100 --> 00:45:34.580]   or was China going after the internet for the rest of us?
[00:45:34.580 --> 00:45:36.820]   - That's a good question, yeah.
[00:45:36.820 --> 00:45:37.860]   - I'm not sure.
[00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:38.700]   I'm not sure.
[00:45:38.700 --> 00:45:40.100]   I actually haven't read a whole lot.
[00:45:40.100 --> 00:45:42.420]   I saw a couple of headlines that Windows 7
[00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:44.300]   or like that one of the bugs that was exploited
[00:45:44.300 --> 00:45:47.260]   was in like all the versions of Windows.
[00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:49.820]   But I'm not sure exactly what the other,
[00:45:49.820 --> 00:45:52.540]   have other companies published information
[00:45:52.540 --> 00:45:53.380]   about these attacks as well?
[00:45:53.380 --> 00:45:57.180]   - Just to Toby, which is an odd company to have been hacked.
[00:45:57.180 --> 00:45:58.180]   - Yeah, you know, it's interesting.
[00:45:58.180 --> 00:46:00.100]   Once again, regardless of what happens,
[00:46:00.100 --> 00:46:02.980]   once again, Google is first to market.
[00:46:02.980 --> 00:46:05.020]   Not this time I was caught up.
[00:46:05.020 --> 00:46:06.900]   But this time with as decision now.
[00:46:06.900 --> 00:46:09.380]   So like if other US companies do follow suits,
[00:46:09.380 --> 00:46:11.260]   say Microsoft and Yahoo both come out and say,
[00:46:11.260 --> 00:46:12.540]   we're going to do the same thing,
[00:46:12.540 --> 00:46:14.860]   that they're just going to look like me too's.
[00:46:14.860 --> 00:46:17.260]   Which is really like Google strategy all the time,
[00:46:17.260 --> 00:46:19.220]   it seems like is to make these sort of, you know,
[00:46:19.220 --> 00:46:21.780]   whatever new products or revolutionary kind of stands
[00:46:21.780 --> 00:46:24.100]   right away and then anyone who tries to follow them,
[00:46:24.100 --> 00:46:27.140]   I mean with the exception of Android, right?
[00:46:27.140 --> 00:46:28.500]   Because iPhone was first.
[00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:29.340]   But you know,
[00:46:29.340 --> 00:46:31.660]   - They can receive jobs since his phones are made there.
[00:46:31.660 --> 00:46:33.020]   - Yeah.
[00:46:33.020 --> 00:46:35.300]   - Well, everything Apple makes is made there, yeah.
[00:46:35.300 --> 00:46:37.340]   - It'll be interesting to see if other companies
[00:46:37.340 --> 00:46:38.500]   do what Google did.
[00:46:38.500 --> 00:46:39.660]   I mean, in one way, it's like,
[00:46:39.660 --> 00:46:41.180]   do you want to look like the Me Too?
[00:46:41.180 --> 00:46:42.860]   Do you want to kind of come out and say,
[00:46:42.860 --> 00:46:44.660]   well, you didn't have the guts to do this first,
[00:46:44.660 --> 00:46:45.980]   but now that they did, we will?
[00:46:45.980 --> 00:46:46.820]   I don't know.
[00:46:46.820 --> 00:46:48.460]   - You know, here's an interesting point,
[00:46:48.460 --> 00:46:52.100]   which is that sometime about six months ago,
[00:46:52.100 --> 00:46:56.300]   it became out that it was believed to be the Chinese
[00:46:56.300 --> 00:46:59.340]   government had hacked the electrical grid in the US
[00:46:59.340 --> 00:47:02.460]   and that many private electrical providers
[00:47:02.460 --> 00:47:05.700]   had trojans on their system that appear to have been put
[00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:06.980]   there by the Chinese government.
[00:47:06.980 --> 00:47:09.980]   And instead, there was no hue and cry.
[00:47:09.980 --> 00:47:11.980]   Secretary Clinton didn't say,
[00:47:11.980 --> 00:47:13.420]   well, you got some explaining to do.
[00:47:13.420 --> 00:47:15.700]   It just kind of went over quietly.
[00:47:15.700 --> 00:47:18.540]   And I think until Google kind of made this big stink,
[00:47:18.540 --> 00:47:21.100]   it was something that the feds could kind of,
[00:47:21.100 --> 00:47:23.220]   you know, we know what's going on.
[00:47:23.220 --> 00:47:25.900]   But apparently, according to some,
[00:47:25.900 --> 00:47:28.460]   these kinds of spearfishing attacks
[00:47:28.460 --> 00:47:31.100]   that were going after human rights advocates
[00:47:31.100 --> 00:47:33.740]   have been going on for three years.
[00:47:33.740 --> 00:47:37.900]   And what's interesting, according to eye defense,
[00:47:37.900 --> 00:47:40.740]   which is a security firm,
[00:47:40.740 --> 00:47:44.240]   that many of these attacks were going after source code.
[00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:48.860]   That for instance, the attack on Adobe was for source code.
[00:47:48.860 --> 00:47:51.500]   - So that's what makes me say that this is more than just--
[00:47:51.500 --> 00:47:53.980]   - This is economic espionage.
[00:47:53.980 --> 00:47:54.820]   - Precisely.
[00:47:54.820 --> 00:47:55.660]   - Oh yeah.
[00:47:55.660 --> 00:47:58.660]   And you know, look, the idea of corporate espionage
[00:47:58.660 --> 00:48:02.140]   is not new, well, to the world, but not new to China either.
[00:48:02.140 --> 00:48:06.380]   And being able to get into Adobe's servers
[00:48:06.380 --> 00:48:10.740]   could certainly serve Chinese software companies quite well,
[00:48:10.740 --> 00:48:12.620]   could serve the Chinese military quite well.
[00:48:12.620 --> 00:48:14.860]   Understanding Adobe's encryption
[00:48:14.860 --> 00:48:16.820]   could serve both interests quite well.
[00:48:16.820 --> 00:48:19.860]   And look, the Chinese military is heavily involved
[00:48:19.860 --> 00:48:21.900]   with a lot of major industries in China.
[00:48:21.900 --> 00:48:24.620]   I mean, right down to the pressing of DVDs--
[00:48:24.620 --> 00:48:25.620]   - Oh, absolutely.
[00:48:25.620 --> 00:48:26.460]   - Absolutely.
[00:48:26.460 --> 00:48:27.540]   - The DVDs that the army's involved.
[00:48:27.540 --> 00:48:29.860]   - The Aeon Hotel's everything, yeah.
[00:48:29.860 --> 00:48:30.700]   - Right, exactly.
[00:48:30.700 --> 00:48:34.940]   So, you know, while you have the internet threatened
[00:48:34.940 --> 00:48:35.980]   and internet security threatened
[00:48:35.980 --> 00:48:38.460]   and the cloud threatened and maybe even Amazon
[00:48:38.460 --> 00:48:40.380]   and eBay threatened down the line,
[00:48:40.380 --> 00:48:45.380]   what is on top of that is the trade secrets
[00:48:45.380 --> 00:48:49.260]   of so many major American companies.
[00:48:49.260 --> 00:48:51.140]   One of the companies listed in the New York Times
[00:48:51.140 --> 00:48:53.420]   the other day that had been a victim of this
[00:48:53.420 --> 00:48:55.100]   was a defense contractor, right?
[00:48:55.100 --> 00:48:56.340]   Which should not be surprising.
[00:48:56.340 --> 00:48:57.380]   If you were the Chinese government
[00:48:57.380 --> 00:48:59.340]   and you had the ability to get,
[00:48:59.340 --> 00:49:02.340]   to breach some systems you would want Northrop Grumman.
[00:49:02.340 --> 00:49:05.260]   You know, you'd wanna get some airplane engine information.
[00:49:05.260 --> 00:49:09.300]   So yeah, it's, you know, it's such a huge problem.
[00:49:09.300 --> 00:49:11.620]   But again, that's what's so fascinating about this is why
[00:49:11.620 --> 00:49:14.620]   this is, I think, gonna be one of the biggest stories
[00:49:14.620 --> 00:49:16.180]   of the next three years.
[00:49:16.180 --> 00:49:17.260]   This is not gonna go away soon.
[00:49:17.260 --> 00:49:18.460]   - But it's not even a dollar story.
[00:49:18.460 --> 00:49:20.860]   Remember the ghost net attacks we heard about last year
[00:49:20.860 --> 00:49:22.260]   against the Dylai Lama.
[00:49:22.260 --> 00:49:24.980]   These are the same techniques, the same technology,
[00:49:24.980 --> 00:49:27.060]   the same controlling servers.
[00:49:27.060 --> 00:49:31.220]   So it's, I mean, I think it's very interesting
[00:49:31.220 --> 00:49:33.420]   because this has been going on, well, we know for,
[00:49:33.420 --> 00:49:36.380]   since 2001, according to F-Secure,
[00:49:36.380 --> 00:49:38.700]   since two, for nine years.
[00:49:38.700 --> 00:49:42.300]   But now Google raises the issue and suddenly it's a story.
[00:49:42.300 --> 00:49:45.020]   It does, in fact, kind of underscore what you said, Jeff,
[00:49:45.020 --> 00:49:48.020]   that Google is now kind of extra national, you know?
[00:49:48.020 --> 00:49:49.860]   - Well, that's not what Deetseid was saying in Germany
[00:49:49.860 --> 00:49:53.620]   was look, Germany and the US didn't have the pardon me,
[00:49:53.620 --> 00:49:55.300]   Kehone. - We didn't do anything.
[00:49:55.300 --> 00:49:56.900]   We just said how is it? - Because, yeah.
[00:49:56.900 --> 00:49:59.620]   - And then Google, you know, you find 31% of the market,
[00:49:59.620 --> 00:50:00.860]   but it has less to lose.
[00:50:00.860 --> 00:50:04.500]   And I think if Siva's, the question is,
[00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:07.620]   if that middle class, if that intelligentsia
[00:50:07.620 --> 00:50:10.060]   does start to feel empowered by this
[00:50:10.060 --> 00:50:12.140]   and feel that someone in the world is gonna back them up,
[00:50:12.140 --> 00:50:12.980]   that's the key.
[00:50:12.980 --> 00:50:15.980]   Someone in the world will back us up.
[00:50:15.980 --> 00:50:17.100]   Then what will they do?
[00:50:18.100 --> 00:50:21.500]   Will it be like the Kurds in Iraq with the first Bush?
[00:50:21.500 --> 00:50:23.820]   Or, you know, what will happen to people
[00:50:23.820 --> 00:50:26.860]   who do try to stand up on behalf of human rights in China?
[00:50:26.860 --> 00:50:28.740]   Right now, there's, you know, we all on the occasion,
[00:50:28.740 --> 00:50:30.500]   "Oh, you shouldn't do that protest
[00:50:30.500 --> 00:50:32.180]   and then let's do some more business, guys."
[00:50:32.180 --> 00:50:34.900]   - And just in case you needed some more encouragement,
[00:50:34.900 --> 00:50:37.860]   one of the security experts from IT Harvest said,
[00:50:37.860 --> 00:50:42.340]   "My message to everybody is you are all under attack.
[00:50:42.340 --> 00:50:44.380]   You are all under attack."
[00:50:44.380 --> 00:50:46.980]   This is going on a very widespread fashion.
[00:50:46.980 --> 00:50:51.220]   Is it in China's interest to hurt the internet?
[00:50:51.220 --> 00:50:53.180]   - It says, "These attacks demonstrate a shift
[00:50:53.180 --> 00:50:55.700]   for the Chinese now brazenly going after
[00:50:55.700 --> 00:50:57.960]   US industry interests."
[00:50:57.960 --> 00:51:01.340]   The defense group incorporated says,
[00:51:01.340 --> 00:51:04.660]   "They've gone from attacking the military and defense
[00:51:04.660 --> 00:51:07.100]   such that it benefited their state
[00:51:07.100 --> 00:51:09.940]   and national security to striking the heart
[00:51:09.940 --> 00:51:13.340]   of American technology economy."
[00:51:13.340 --> 00:51:14.580]   - And I hate to get, you know,
[00:51:14.580 --> 00:51:16.260]   to now I'll be accused of being Republican,
[00:51:16.260 --> 00:51:18.820]   but Al-Qaeda is rooting them on.
[00:51:18.820 --> 00:51:20.620]   - Now Al-Qaeda doesn't have the sophistication though.
[00:51:20.620 --> 00:51:21.900]   This is what's really interesting.
[00:51:21.900 --> 00:51:22.740]   - They're telling us to help.
[00:51:22.740 --> 00:51:24.220]   - China has the sophistication to do this.
[00:51:24.220 --> 00:51:26.300]   And the, well, I think what you're seeing is it's hard,
[00:51:26.300 --> 00:51:28.220]   I mean, it's hard liners in China.
[00:51:28.220 --> 00:51:30.820]   And maybe if the world gets upset
[00:51:30.820 --> 00:51:32.100]   and finally stands up to this,
[00:51:32.100 --> 00:51:33.420]   maybe starting with Google,
[00:51:33.420 --> 00:51:36.060]   I'd love to see Microsoft and Yahoo come along.
[00:51:36.060 --> 00:51:38.820]   - There are those, this goes to modernity.
[00:51:38.820 --> 00:51:42.340]   It goes to those who think that the internet is a bad thing
[00:51:42.340 --> 00:51:45.180]   because the internet takes away control.
[00:51:45.180 --> 00:51:47.060]   - Well, or it's a good thing because it lets us
[00:51:47.060 --> 00:51:48.540]   invade your systems.
[00:51:48.540 --> 00:51:49.940]   I don't think they're trying to shut down the internet.
[00:51:49.940 --> 00:51:51.380]   They love this.
[00:51:51.380 --> 00:51:52.740]   - Nobody's more modern than Chinese.
[00:51:52.740 --> 00:51:55.060]   The Chinese just want the internet on their terms.
[00:51:55.060 --> 00:51:55.900]   - Yeah.
[00:51:55.900 --> 00:51:58.540]   - And the internet is not forever the internet.
[00:51:58.540 --> 00:51:59.380]   There's nothing.
[00:51:59.380 --> 00:52:00.940]   - Well, and it's, but it's not,
[00:52:00.940 --> 00:52:02.980]   I think it's, I would say, I can even go farther say,
[00:52:02.980 --> 00:52:05.380]   it's not about filtering at this point.
[00:52:05.380 --> 00:52:08.860]   It's about using the, I mean, this isn't about--
[00:52:08.860 --> 00:52:11.180]   - It's about the very definition of the internet.
[00:52:11.180 --> 00:52:13.420]   It is the Constitution, the internet, the Warfar ago.
[00:52:13.420 --> 00:52:14.260]   - I agree with you there,
[00:52:14.260 --> 00:52:15.980]   but I won't go as far as modernity.
[00:52:15.980 --> 00:52:17.060]   I mean, it's really--
[00:52:17.060 --> 00:52:17.900]   - The more I--
[00:52:17.900 --> 00:52:21.220]   - It's a different vision of how things should be laid out.
[00:52:21.220 --> 00:52:24.060]   But, you know, look, the Chinese government would love,
[00:52:24.060 --> 00:52:26.980]   you know, everybody to be totally wired just--
[00:52:26.980 --> 00:52:27.820]   - Under their term.
[00:52:27.820 --> 00:52:28.820]   - The way that I am.
[00:52:28.820 --> 00:52:29.820]   (laughing)
[00:52:29.820 --> 00:52:32.340]   - And I think this is them being economically
[00:52:32.340 --> 00:52:34.500]   very aggressive and competitive and saying,
[00:52:34.500 --> 00:52:36.780]   we're gonna steal your stuff.
[00:52:36.780 --> 00:52:38.980]   We're gonna make it better than you.
[00:52:38.980 --> 00:52:39.820]   We're gonna--
[00:52:39.820 --> 00:52:41.340]   - The great irony to me is that,
[00:52:41.340 --> 00:52:44.540]   that we attack China as a moral communist country
[00:52:44.540 --> 00:52:48.020]   when China has become the most capitalist country.
[00:52:48.020 --> 00:52:50.180]   - I've said that for a long time.
[00:52:50.180 --> 00:52:51.020]   - Instead of standard.
[00:52:51.020 --> 00:52:54.820]   - If you wanna worry about capitalism run riot.
[00:52:54.820 --> 00:52:55.660]   - You're watching it.
[00:52:55.660 --> 00:52:58.700]   - You just wait to one billion Chinese say,
[00:52:58.700 --> 00:53:00.000]   okay, here we come.
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:03.140]   'Cause they, you know, absolutely.
[00:53:03.140 --> 00:53:05.940]   - And that's why the idea that no matter what the cause,
[00:53:05.940 --> 00:53:10.940]   if the rationale and discussion is about evil and ethics,
[00:53:11.780 --> 00:53:15.220]   I'm glad for that, but it's not purely about,
[00:53:15.220 --> 00:53:16.700]   even though it is enlightened self-interest,
[00:53:16.700 --> 00:53:17.900]   there's an enlightenment in Malta.
[00:53:17.900 --> 00:53:19.980]   I think that's very important for the discussion.
[00:53:19.980 --> 00:53:23.060]   - I think it was Bill Gross who said
[00:53:23.060 --> 00:53:26.460]   that China slept through the Industrial Revolution.
[00:53:26.460 --> 00:53:29.340]   They've woken up in the IT revolution
[00:53:29.340 --> 00:53:31.780]   and they're not gonna miss this boat.
[00:53:31.780 --> 00:53:35.300]   They may have a different opinion about how to run it,
[00:53:35.300 --> 00:53:36.980]   but they're not gonna miss this boat.
[00:53:36.980 --> 00:53:38.820]   We're gonna move on to topic two.
[00:53:38.820 --> 00:53:40.740]   There doesn't really need to be a topic two on this one,
[00:53:40.740 --> 00:53:45.740]   but we promised we would talk about the Nexus One phone.
[00:53:45.740 --> 00:53:47.940]   - And where is it made?
[00:53:47.940 --> 00:53:49.100]   - In China, I'm sure.
[00:53:49.100 --> 00:53:50.700]   Well, it doesn't say, but I'm sure it's in China.
[00:53:50.700 --> 00:53:52.100]   It's made by HTC, I don't know.
[00:53:52.100 --> 00:53:53.780]   - HTC, yeah.
[00:53:53.780 --> 00:53:57.140]   - So Jeff, now I'm gonna say even more strongly
[00:53:57.140 --> 00:53:58.340]   than I did last week.
[00:53:58.340 --> 00:54:01.700]   And you've given it some time, I hope,
[00:54:01.700 --> 00:54:05.380]   but this phone in my opinion knocks the socks off the iPhone.
[00:54:05.380 --> 00:54:08.260]   It is simply the best phone I've ever used.
[00:54:08.260 --> 00:54:11.220]   - Gina, you're gonna back me up on this one?
[00:54:11.220 --> 00:54:12.540]   - Well, of course.
[00:54:12.540 --> 00:54:13.940]   But wait a second now,
[00:54:13.940 --> 00:54:15.300]   but you were the one in the middle.
[00:54:15.300 --> 00:54:16.460]   - You took a spy or I know.
[00:54:16.460 --> 00:54:19.380]   - I was in the middle 'cause I hadn't used it yet.
[00:54:19.380 --> 00:54:21.300]   Mine was waiting for me at home.
[00:54:21.300 --> 00:54:22.140]   - But wait a second.
[00:54:22.140 --> 00:54:23.340]   So Leo, this is your phone now?
[00:54:23.340 --> 00:54:24.820]   Like this is your primary phone?
[00:54:24.820 --> 00:54:26.860]   - Do you see an iPhone anywhere in here?
[00:54:26.860 --> 00:54:29.460]   - I know, I'm well welcome.
[00:54:29.460 --> 00:54:30.780]   (laughs)
[00:54:30.780 --> 00:54:32.260]   - It's finally good enough and I'll tell you,
[00:54:32.260 --> 00:54:34.460]   in some ways it's better, the screen is spectacular.
[00:54:34.460 --> 00:54:35.300]   They're not great in daylight
[00:54:35.300 --> 00:54:36.460]   'cause OLED doesn't do well in daylight,
[00:54:36.460 --> 00:54:38.460]   but when I go back to the iPhone,
[00:54:38.460 --> 00:54:42.700]   it just feels blurry and washed out and just-
[00:54:42.700 --> 00:54:44.100]   - Let's see, converted.
[00:54:44.100 --> 00:54:45.540]   That's okay, that's good.
[00:54:45.540 --> 00:54:47.180]   - The UI with the five pages,
[00:54:47.180 --> 00:54:48.900]   and I used your folders trick,
[00:54:48.900 --> 00:54:51.580]   which basically gives the UI unlimited pages, right?
[00:54:51.580 --> 00:54:54.340]   Now we can, or not unlimited, but we certainly-
[00:54:54.340 --> 00:54:56.380]   - Well, that's spunked grin on Gina's face.
[00:54:56.380 --> 00:54:58.500]   - That's a great tip, and if you missed that,
[00:54:58.500 --> 00:55:00.100]   listen to it last week,
[00:55:00.100 --> 00:55:02.300]   which by the way was late coming out because of CES,
[00:55:02.300 --> 00:55:04.100]   and I think our editors, in fact,
[00:55:04.100 --> 00:55:05.740]   if you're watching live, I think it's still not out,
[00:55:05.740 --> 00:55:08.060]   but we'll get it out before we get this one out.
[00:55:08.060 --> 00:55:10.140]   I just love the Widgeting.
[00:55:10.140 --> 00:55:11.380]   There's some great widgets on here.
[00:55:11.380 --> 00:55:16.420]   I think Google has enhanced its applications.
[00:55:16.420 --> 00:55:20.300]   Now I did get the straight scoop on multi-touch.
[00:55:20.300 --> 00:55:21.700]   - Yeah, let's talk about that.
[00:55:21.700 --> 00:55:23.580]   - I got an email from inside Google.
[00:55:23.580 --> 00:55:25.780]   Okay, you're gonna love this.
[00:55:25.780 --> 00:55:28.020]   And now again, it's un-sourced, it's inside Google,
[00:55:28.020 --> 00:55:29.700]   and blah, blah, blah.
[00:55:29.700 --> 00:55:31.260]   But I do believe it's inside Google.
[00:55:31.260 --> 00:55:35.340]   He said, "Apple asked us not to implement
[00:55:35.340 --> 00:55:38.700]   "multi-touch just yet in the US,
[00:55:38.700 --> 00:55:41.140]   "because Apple knows its patents for multi-touch
[00:55:41.140 --> 00:55:44.940]   "are very weak and doesn't want to contest them
[00:55:44.940 --> 00:55:46.100]   "at this point."
[00:55:46.100 --> 00:55:48.820]   So Apple, which apparently still has very good relationships
[00:55:48.820 --> 00:55:51.500]   with Google over everything except phones,
[00:55:51.500 --> 00:55:55.420]   said, "Hey, Eric, dude."
[00:55:55.420 --> 00:55:58.100]   - Could Google have licensed multi-touch from Apple?
[00:55:58.100 --> 00:55:59.300]   - Yeah, that might've been one way to do it,
[00:55:59.300 --> 00:56:00.700]   but the truth is multi-touch is in here.
[00:56:00.700 --> 00:56:02.260]   The milestone does do multi-touch,
[00:56:02.260 --> 00:56:05.100]   the droid in Europe, that the OS supports it,
[00:56:05.100 --> 00:56:06.740]   and in fact, the guy who sent it to me said,
[00:56:06.740 --> 00:56:08.460]   "I could prove multi-touch is in there.
[00:56:08.460 --> 00:56:12.300]   "Press shift and P at the same time on your keyboard."
[00:56:12.300 --> 00:56:15.260]   And in fact, there are a number of applications available,
[00:56:15.260 --> 00:56:18.540]   including a browser that support multi-touch on here.
[00:56:18.540 --> 00:56:20.260]   So it's just that the Google apps
[00:56:20.260 --> 00:56:22.780]   don't have multi-touch enabled, it is on the phone.
[00:56:22.780 --> 00:56:26.180]   And I expect it'll be enabled fully as soon as Apple,
[00:56:26.180 --> 00:56:28.100]   I don't know, that's what,
[00:56:28.100 --> 00:56:30.300]   licenses at the Google or whatever it is,
[00:56:30.300 --> 00:56:31.940]   to avoid the court case.
[00:56:31.940 --> 00:56:33.980]   But that's all that's missing on here is multi-touch.
[00:56:33.980 --> 00:56:35.980]   And I think in many ways, for instance,
[00:56:35.980 --> 00:56:38.500]   the gallery application, which is much improved in 2.1,
[00:56:38.500 --> 00:56:41.620]   and pulls from Picasa is spectacular.
[00:56:41.620 --> 00:56:45.540]   If it had multi-touch, it'd be the best photo application out there.
[00:56:45.540 --> 00:56:47.140]   The camera is great.
[00:56:47.140 --> 00:56:50.100]   It's a much better camera than the iPhone.
[00:56:50.100 --> 00:56:53.380]   In fact, it's as good as the N95 or the N900.
[00:56:53.380 --> 00:56:55.900]   It's a great five megapixel camera.
[00:56:55.900 --> 00:56:57.220]   I'm just, I'm blown away by this.
[00:56:57.220 --> 00:56:58.300]   - What network do you use, Leo?
[00:56:58.300 --> 00:57:01.900]   - It's T-Mobile, but you know, where I am, T-Mobile's okay.
[00:57:01.900 --> 00:57:03.820]   I have HSDPA and I have, you know,
[00:57:03.820 --> 00:57:04.900]   it's decent connectivity.
[00:57:04.900 --> 00:57:08.820]   It, frankly, it's better than AT&T here.
[00:57:08.820 --> 00:57:09.820]   Doesn't drop calls as much.
[00:57:09.820 --> 00:57:11.580]   - Leo, I would imagine you have your own cell tower
[00:57:11.580 --> 00:57:12.420]   in the back here.
[00:57:12.420 --> 00:57:14.700]   - Oh, I mentioned that, I T-Mobile did put one out there.
[00:57:14.700 --> 00:57:17.740]   So, no, I've had good results with T-Mobile.
[00:57:17.740 --> 00:57:19.500]   I think when this is out on Verizon,
[00:57:19.500 --> 00:57:22.140]   which I'm told it will be March 23rd,
[00:57:22.140 --> 00:57:24.140]   the first day of spring, 2010,
[00:57:24.140 --> 00:57:28.740]   this will be the best phone in America.
[00:57:31.340 --> 00:57:32.860]   So, Jeff, how's your experience?
[00:57:32.860 --> 00:57:33.860]   Have you come along?
[00:57:33.860 --> 00:57:35.540]   Are you coming along?
[00:57:35.540 --> 00:57:37.060]   - I'm coming along.
[00:57:37.060 --> 00:57:39.300]   I'm being pissy.
[00:57:39.300 --> 00:57:40.140]   - No, be pissy.
[00:57:40.140 --> 00:57:42.140]   That's, somebody's got a descent here.
[00:57:42.140 --> 00:57:43.060]   - Talk to us, talk to us.
[00:57:43.060 --> 00:57:44.860]   - I have a whole bunch of questions for Gina.
[00:57:44.860 --> 00:57:45.700]   Okay.
[00:57:45.700 --> 00:57:46.940]   (laughing)
[00:57:46.940 --> 00:57:48.500]   Let me see, where do I start here?
[00:57:48.500 --> 00:57:50.380]   The first thing that's driving me a little nutty about it
[00:57:50.380 --> 00:57:53.900]   is I cannot turn off all the friggin' notifications
[00:57:53.900 --> 00:57:55.740]   and I can't tell what it's notifying me about.
[00:57:55.740 --> 00:57:58.460]   It's, you know, buzzing again.
[00:57:58.460 --> 00:58:00.860]   And I'm going to turn them off all over.
[00:58:00.860 --> 00:58:01.700]   - I don't know.
[00:58:01.700 --> 00:58:03.300]   - No, no, you have to do an application by application.
[00:58:03.300 --> 00:58:04.140]   - I have no idea.
[00:58:04.140 --> 00:58:06.060]   - It took me a little while to figure this out, Jeff.
[00:58:06.060 --> 00:58:09.500]   I'm with you, but I love the notification system on Android.
[00:58:09.500 --> 00:58:11.060]   And you can totally control it.
[00:58:11.060 --> 00:58:12.780]   So you have different sounds for each program.
[00:58:12.780 --> 00:58:14.780]   I have Twidroid that does a tweet
[00:58:14.780 --> 00:58:16.220]   when I get a direct message.
[00:58:16.220 --> 00:58:17.820]   My email makes a different sound.
[00:58:17.820 --> 00:58:19.020]   My text message makes a different sound.
[00:58:19.020 --> 00:58:20.980]   - None. I can't turn them off.
[00:58:20.980 --> 00:58:21.820]   - Or you can turn them off.
[00:58:21.820 --> 00:58:23.820]   - Jeff, you found the window shade, right?
[00:58:23.820 --> 00:58:25.740]   So like if you pull and drag down,
[00:58:25.740 --> 00:58:29.100]   you'll get the details of what the notifications mean.
[00:58:29.100 --> 00:58:30.700]   - Oh, see, this is why--
[00:58:30.700 --> 00:58:32.380]   - Oh, you didn't know about that?
[00:58:32.380 --> 00:58:34.180]   - Yeah, tap and drag this now.
[00:58:34.180 --> 00:58:36.740]   This is one of the coolest things that Android has over the iPhone.
[00:58:36.740 --> 00:58:38.420]   You don't have the iPhone's notifications
[00:58:38.420 --> 00:58:39.860]   or just these kind of modal pop-ups.
[00:58:39.860 --> 00:58:41.420]   - Oh, why is it just missed the one by one?
[00:58:41.420 --> 00:58:42.740]   - That's just these notifications.
[00:58:42.740 --> 00:58:43.580]   - Yeah.
[00:58:43.580 --> 00:58:45.380]   - But I only have two on here.
[00:58:45.380 --> 00:58:49.220]   And it's been buzzing at me like every 10 minutes.
[00:58:49.220 --> 00:58:50.060]   - Yeah, okay.
[00:58:50.060 --> 00:58:51.540]   So if you pull down the window shade,
[00:58:51.540 --> 00:58:52.860]   just check out to see what are they.
[00:58:52.860 --> 00:58:55.580]   Is it, you know, is it, is it seismic?
[00:58:55.580 --> 00:58:57.300]   Is it your Gmail?
[00:58:57.300 --> 00:58:58.820]   And then you can, or is it Google Voice?
[00:58:58.820 --> 00:59:00.700]   And then you just need to go into each application
[00:59:00.700 --> 00:59:03.460]   in the settings and say notify me, yes, no, maybe.
[00:59:03.460 --> 00:59:05.580]   Seismic, you can say notify me for DMs,
[00:59:05.580 --> 00:59:08.500]   but not for @ replies or notify me for all.
[00:59:08.500 --> 00:59:10.900]   You can, you just have to calibrate it.
[00:59:10.900 --> 00:59:12.540]   And I agree, when I first, you know,
[00:59:12.540 --> 00:59:13.780]   when you first set up an Android phone,
[00:59:13.780 --> 00:59:16.620]   often the notifications come so, so, you know,
[00:59:16.620 --> 00:59:18.180]   so much and the phone buzzes so much
[00:59:18.180 --> 00:59:19.180]   that it gets overwhelming.
[00:59:19.180 --> 00:59:20.500]   It's just a matter of configuring.
[00:59:20.500 --> 00:59:22.380]   - But you can totally configure it.
[00:59:22.380 --> 00:59:25.140]   But it's per, it's a per application setting.
[00:59:25.140 --> 00:59:25.980]   - Yeah.
[00:59:25.980 --> 00:59:29.620]   - I love the unified email box and this is great.
[00:59:29.620 --> 00:59:32.660]   I mean, that, that, this is something the iPhone doesn't do.
[00:59:32.660 --> 00:59:33.500]   Just put it off.
[00:59:33.500 --> 00:59:34.340]   - Yeah, but I don't think the email is as good
[00:59:34.340 --> 00:59:36.180]   as the iPhone app.
[00:59:36.180 --> 00:59:38.540]   I mean, I wanna, I have to open it to,
[00:59:38.540 --> 00:59:39.620]   I mean, I don't open it to kill it,
[00:59:39.620 --> 00:59:41.180]   but I wanna be able to, again,
[00:59:41.180 --> 00:59:44.660]   it's not using the gestures enough, I think.
[00:59:44.660 --> 00:59:49.100]   And the main app doesn't put conversations together.
[00:59:49.100 --> 00:59:52.100]   And the Gmail app, I don't think is as good here as it is.
[00:59:52.100 --> 00:59:54.220]   - The main app does, and I would use the main app.
[00:59:54.220 --> 00:59:55.900]   Oh, you mean, threaded conversations.
[00:59:55.900 --> 00:59:57.740]   - I think I'm saying, yeah, that is a nice feature.
[00:59:57.740 --> 00:59:58.580]   And I wish it did that.
[00:59:58.580 --> 01:00:01.140]   - It's weird that it doesn't operate like Google Mail
[01:00:01.140 --> 01:00:02.540]   in the phone.
[01:00:02.540 --> 01:00:04.860]   - They can't do the email app, I think it's a little weak.
[01:00:04.860 --> 01:00:06.860]   - What don't you like about the Gmail app?
[01:00:06.860 --> 01:00:09.180]   Because that's actually one of my main reasons
[01:00:09.180 --> 01:00:10.860]   for being on Android as well.
[01:00:10.860 --> 01:00:15.900]   - Silly stuff, I will be able to read more on it.
[01:00:15.900 --> 01:00:19.460]   I wish that I could use gestures more to do things like
[01:00:19.460 --> 01:00:22.300]   kill, I'm gonna, you know, I can mark them and kill them.
[01:00:22.300 --> 01:00:25.420]   Getting to, let's see, boxes,
[01:00:25.420 --> 01:00:26.420]   so I know how to do that.
[01:00:26.420 --> 01:00:29.700]   Yeah, how do I get to the other mailboxes?
[01:00:29.700 --> 01:00:33.300]   - So there's, well, there's two ways.
[01:00:33.300 --> 01:00:36.140]   There's the Gmail app itself, and then you just hit,
[01:00:36.140 --> 01:00:37.620]   you hit the menu item at the bottom.
[01:00:37.620 --> 01:00:39.620]   You know, the button at the bottom with the lines?
[01:00:39.620 --> 01:00:40.460]   Is that setting? - Yep, yep, yep,
[01:00:40.460 --> 01:00:41.300]   we got that far. - And how do I get
[01:00:41.300 --> 01:00:42.380]   into other mailboxes? - You know what I'm saying?
[01:00:42.380 --> 01:00:43.860]   - How do I get into my outboxes,
[01:00:43.860 --> 01:00:46.020]   or my sent box from there?
[01:00:46.020 --> 01:00:47.140]   - Oh, I see what you mean.
[01:00:47.140 --> 01:00:49.420]   Other mailboxes, okay, so just, it's labels.
[01:00:49.420 --> 01:00:52.100]   So hit that menu button, and then you see it.
[01:00:52.100 --> 01:00:54.100]   - View labels, yeah, you can just go into the line.
[01:00:54.100 --> 01:00:55.100]   - Google engineer.
[01:00:55.100 --> 01:00:57.180]   - No, I'm not going to get into the label.
[01:00:57.180 --> 01:00:59.300]   - Yeah, that's one thing I didn't like about Gmail.
[01:00:59.300 --> 01:01:00.140]   - That's what they think, right?
[01:01:00.140 --> 01:01:00.980]   - Is it focusing on labels? - Okay, all right,
[01:01:00.980 --> 01:01:02.900]   this is helping me immensely, all right.
[01:01:02.900 --> 01:01:07.900]   Next, my C's-mic thinks that it's 19 hours ago at all times.
[01:01:07.900 --> 01:01:12.420]   - I would buy, I would buy Twidroid Pro.
[01:01:12.420 --> 01:01:13.620]   I know a lot of people like C's-mic,
[01:01:13.620 --> 01:01:16.460]   but Twidroid Pro, to me, is so much more customizable.
[01:01:16.460 --> 01:01:17.980]   I have much multiple accounts.
[01:01:17.980 --> 01:01:20.340]   Control the notifications, so for instance,
[01:01:20.340 --> 01:01:21.740]   C's-mic can notify you for everything.
[01:01:21.740 --> 01:01:23.420]   Twidroid, you can just say,
[01:01:23.420 --> 01:01:24.900]   oh look, email just forced close.
[01:01:24.900 --> 01:01:26.100]   That's been happening a lot for me.
[01:01:26.100 --> 01:01:26.940]   That's the only application.
[01:01:26.940 --> 01:01:27.780]   - That's another question.
[01:01:27.780 --> 01:01:28.780]   How do I kill an app?
[01:01:28.780 --> 01:01:30.260]   Because sometimes I just want to kill the app
[01:01:30.260 --> 01:01:31.100]   and I can't figure out how to do that.
[01:01:31.100 --> 01:01:32.900]   - Yeah, I don't know what you do, Gina,
[01:01:32.900 --> 01:01:34.460]   but I got the advanced task manager,
[01:01:34.460 --> 01:01:36.580]   which I really like on here.
[01:01:36.580 --> 01:01:39.660]   - If you go into settings, so you go to the menu,
[01:01:39.660 --> 01:01:41.940]   so you tap the menu and you go to settings,
[01:01:41.940 --> 01:01:44.020]   and you go to applications, you can see
[01:01:44.020 --> 01:01:46.220]   a list of running services.
[01:01:46.220 --> 01:01:47.060]   - Thank you, there you go.
[01:01:47.060 --> 01:01:50.260]   - And you can quit any one of them from there.
[01:01:50.260 --> 01:01:52.740]   Some applications have the option to quit
[01:01:52.740 --> 01:01:53.940]   inside of its own settings.
[01:01:53.940 --> 01:01:55.820]   Like C's-mic, you can go into C's-mic settings
[01:01:55.820 --> 01:01:57.140]   and there's a quit option.
[01:01:57.140 --> 01:01:59.540]   I think it's buried in the more menu.
[01:01:59.540 --> 01:02:01.620]   But if there's a process running on your phone
[01:02:01.620 --> 01:02:03.180]   that's sucking up a lot of battery,
[01:02:03.180 --> 01:02:04.060]   and you can see that too,
[01:02:04.060 --> 01:02:06.780]   because Android will list the biggest battery hogs,
[01:02:06.780 --> 01:02:08.340]   your phone's been on for four hours
[01:02:08.340 --> 01:02:11.540]   and your display has used this percentage of battery.
[01:02:11.540 --> 01:02:12.940]   - You definitely.
[01:02:12.940 --> 01:02:14.860]   - That's also in settings.
[01:02:14.860 --> 01:02:15.700]   Let's see.
[01:02:15.700 --> 01:02:17.860]   - I think it's in the running services in applications,
[01:02:17.860 --> 01:02:18.780]   isn't it?
[01:02:18.780 --> 01:02:19.980]   Does that show you battery life?
[01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:21.060]   No.
[01:02:21.060 --> 01:02:24.340]   - See, I actually downloaded and used a task manager,
[01:02:24.340 --> 01:02:26.500]   which lets me just kind of mass kill everything.
[01:02:26.500 --> 01:02:28.100]   And I do that from time to time.
[01:02:28.100 --> 01:02:32.740]   - If you go into settings about phone, battery use.
[01:02:32.740 --> 01:02:34.260]   - Oh, that's handy.
[01:02:34.260 --> 01:02:37.580]   - So yeah, so my display has taken up 82%
[01:02:37.580 --> 01:02:39.300]   of the battery, my live wallpapers,
[01:02:39.300 --> 01:02:41.580]   it's taken up 7% live wallpapers are cool,
[01:02:41.580 --> 01:02:43.260]   but they eat CPU.
[01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:47.420]   Yeah, you can see a whole list there.
[01:02:47.420 --> 01:02:48.380]   - That's nice.
[01:02:48.380 --> 01:02:49.460]   - Okay, that's good, all right.
[01:02:49.460 --> 01:02:50.300]   - Mom, I'm getting there in my list.
[01:02:50.300 --> 01:02:51.140]   This is beautiful.
[01:02:51.140 --> 01:02:53.780]   I'm gonna be taking communion shortly.
[01:02:53.780 --> 01:02:56.740]   - I mean, let's just say in Android,
[01:02:56.740 --> 01:02:58.780]   there are many sub menus and there's lots of tap.
[01:02:58.780 --> 01:03:00.900]   - Yeah, it's really hard to get the logic up.
[01:03:00.900 --> 01:03:02.380]   Speaking of logic, here's my main thing.
[01:03:02.380 --> 01:03:05.260]   I still give me a worldview.
[01:03:05.260 --> 01:03:10.260]   So I understand the difference between the home screens,
[01:03:10.260 --> 01:03:14.420]   the little hash mark screens,
[01:03:14.420 --> 01:03:18.500]   the idea of a folder,
[01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:22.540]   the idea of a widget, what's a shortcut?
[01:03:22.540 --> 01:03:24.780]   I'm just confused about the structure of this.
[01:03:24.780 --> 01:03:27.060]   And I think it's simpler than I'm giving it credit for,
[01:03:27.060 --> 01:03:31.220]   but there's some elegant logic here that I'm not seeing.
[01:03:31.220 --> 01:03:33.580]   - Yeah, so, okay, so you use a Mac, right?
[01:03:33.580 --> 01:03:34.420]   - Yeah.
[01:03:34.420 --> 01:03:36.380]   - So, I mean, the Android paradigm
[01:03:36.380 --> 01:03:37.860]   is much different from the iPhone paradigm,
[01:03:37.860 --> 01:03:38.940]   and for these reasons.
[01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:40.700]   And I think this is why people who use the iPhone,
[01:03:40.700 --> 01:03:43.180]   who try Android at first, are just totally put off.
[01:03:43.180 --> 01:03:44.740]   The Android paradigm is very similar
[01:03:44.740 --> 01:03:46.260]   to your desktop computer.
[01:03:46.260 --> 01:03:48.700]   There's your desktop, which is an Android terms,
[01:03:48.700 --> 01:03:49.780]   are the home screens.
[01:03:49.780 --> 01:03:50.700]   Those are the screens that you see
[01:03:50.700 --> 01:03:52.700]   when you kind of swipe to left to right.
[01:03:52.700 --> 01:03:56.540]   And then there's the menu, which would be the equivalent,
[01:03:56.540 --> 01:03:58.580]   the menu when you tap the menu button,
[01:03:58.580 --> 01:04:00.660]   that little button that looks like a grid,
[01:04:00.660 --> 01:04:02.860]   that shows you everything that's installed on the phone.
[01:04:02.860 --> 01:04:04.460]   That's the equivalent is if you had
[01:04:04.460 --> 01:04:08.060]   an applications folder stack on your Mac's dock,
[01:04:08.060 --> 01:04:10.540]   and you click it, or if you just go to the applications folder,
[01:04:10.540 --> 01:04:13.140]   it shows you every single thing that's installed on the phone.
[01:04:13.140 --> 01:04:17.020]   So, the point of having both the applications menu,
[01:04:17.020 --> 01:04:18.940]   and the home screens, is just the same reason
[01:04:18.940 --> 01:04:21.060]   why you have a desktop on your desktop computer,
[01:04:21.060 --> 01:04:22.980]   and an applications list.
[01:04:22.980 --> 01:04:24.780]   The home screens give you the opportunity
[01:04:24.780 --> 01:04:26.900]   to put shortcuts to the things that you use the most.
[01:04:26.900 --> 01:04:28.420]   So you don't have to scroll through the home,
[01:04:28.420 --> 01:04:31.180]   you know, applications menu every time.
[01:04:31.180 --> 01:04:32.180]   Does that make sense?
[01:04:32.180 --> 01:04:33.020]   - That makes sense.
[01:04:33.020 --> 01:04:36.100]   Okay, Dan, so then if I hold down on the home screen,
[01:04:36.100 --> 01:04:39.180]   and I, let's say hit shortcut,
[01:04:39.180 --> 01:04:41.820]   I get a very limited list of a few things.
[01:04:41.820 --> 01:04:43.500]   I don't understand that function.
[01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:45.660]   The way to do a shortcut is just to hold down on the app
[01:04:45.660 --> 01:04:47.140]   in the grid thing.
[01:04:47.140 --> 01:04:48.620]   - Yeah, that's the best way to do it.
[01:04:48.620 --> 01:04:50.140]   It's faster, yeah.
[01:04:50.140 --> 01:04:51.780]   - So there's nothing special about this shortcut.
[01:04:51.780 --> 01:04:52.620]   - No, no, no.
[01:04:52.620 --> 01:04:54.620]   By the way, works best with Gina's folder tip,
[01:04:54.620 --> 01:04:57.180]   because you can hold it down and drag it to a folder directly.
[01:04:57.180 --> 01:04:58.860]   So if you wanna add something to a folder,
[01:04:58.860 --> 01:05:00.900]   you just hold it down and drag it into the folder.
[01:05:00.900 --> 01:05:02.020]   It works great.
[01:05:02.020 --> 01:05:06.140]   - Yeah, I mean, the add to home screen shortcuts dialogues.
[01:05:06.140 --> 01:05:08.420]   If you tap and hold your wallpaper,
[01:05:08.420 --> 01:05:09.500]   you get that add to home screen.
[01:05:09.500 --> 01:05:10.900]   That also is pretty hierarchical.
[01:05:10.900 --> 01:05:11.780]   So you only get a few choices.
[01:05:11.780 --> 01:05:14.380]   You get shortcuts, widgets, folders, wallpapers,
[01:05:14.380 --> 01:05:15.780]   but then you drill down into each.
[01:05:15.780 --> 01:05:17.740]   - There's a lot of kinds of shortcuts, for instance.
[01:05:17.740 --> 01:05:19.780]   - Yeah, there's a lot of different kinds of shortcuts.
[01:05:19.780 --> 01:05:21.580]   - It's worth investigating this.
[01:05:21.580 --> 01:05:23.220]   I think widgets are fantastic.
[01:05:23.220 --> 01:05:25.460]   I've even downloaded a few extra widgets,
[01:05:25.460 --> 01:05:28.140]   because this is something that's lacking on the iPhone.
[01:05:28.140 --> 01:05:29.500]   The ability to put, for instance,
[01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:32.380]   a big Facebook widget that gives you status updates,
[01:05:32.380 --> 01:05:34.820]   or this widget that goes with the Google News
[01:05:34.820 --> 01:05:36.220]   and weather application,
[01:05:36.220 --> 01:05:38.540]   or even just a big weather and clock application.
[01:05:38.540 --> 01:05:40.300]   This is something missing from the iPhone.
[01:05:40.300 --> 01:05:41.860]   I love having the calendar right there
[01:05:41.860 --> 01:05:43.780]   that I can tap on it and see the calendar.
[01:05:43.780 --> 01:05:45.860]   I think they've done a nice job with the widgets.
[01:05:45.860 --> 01:05:48.100]   I really want to put a shortcut, for example,
[01:05:48.100 --> 01:05:50.660]   to get right to the Wi-Fi settings
[01:05:50.660 --> 01:05:52.940]   without having to go through these three layers.
[01:05:52.940 --> 01:05:53.900]   - Here's what I would--
[01:05:53.900 --> 01:05:56.580]   There's a set of widgets called beautiful widgets
[01:05:56.580 --> 01:05:58.140]   that are really great.
[01:05:58.140 --> 01:06:00.020]   I use those all the time.
[01:06:00.020 --> 01:06:01.100]   And there's a number of them.
[01:06:01.100 --> 01:06:04.580]   Blutiful, Bluetooth, GPS, plain mode, silent.
[01:06:04.580 --> 01:06:06.420]   You can actually have a beautiful Wi-Fi,
[01:06:06.420 --> 01:06:09.300]   which will put a widget that you can just turn on or off there.
[01:06:09.300 --> 01:06:10.980]   But there's also a larger widget.
[01:06:10.980 --> 01:06:12.060]   I bet Gina uses this.
[01:06:12.060 --> 01:06:13.180]   It comes on the phone,
[01:06:13.180 --> 01:06:15.980]   where you get all of these wireless connections.
[01:06:15.980 --> 01:06:18.060]   So I've turned off Bluetooth to say battery life,
[01:06:18.060 --> 01:06:19.700]   'cause I'm not in my car right now,
[01:06:19.700 --> 01:06:21.660]   or I could change the screen.
[01:06:21.660 --> 01:06:24.020]   And that general one is a really--
[01:06:24.020 --> 01:06:26.900]   - That doesn't really, you can't really adjust things there,
[01:06:26.900 --> 01:06:28.380]   but you can just turn on or off.
[01:06:28.380 --> 01:06:29.780]   - Just if Tom was not enough.
[01:06:29.780 --> 01:06:33.620]   So, Jeff, if you wanted to do a shortcut directly to Wi-Fi settings,
[01:06:33.620 --> 01:06:36.380]   you tap and hold on the home screen.
[01:06:36.380 --> 01:06:39.380]   And then you go to shortcuts,
[01:06:39.380 --> 01:06:42.260]   and then scroll down and choose settings.
[01:06:42.260 --> 01:06:44.180]   And then scroll down and choose Wi-Fi settings.
[01:06:44.180 --> 01:06:45.660]   - You could take any setting and put it on there.
[01:06:45.660 --> 01:06:46.500]   That's cool.
[01:06:46.500 --> 01:06:48.380]   You could do that also with a phone number.
[01:06:48.380 --> 01:06:51.300]   If you wanna text somebody with one touch,
[01:06:51.300 --> 01:06:53.340]   or call somebody with one touch, that's cool.
[01:06:53.340 --> 01:06:54.900]   - And then just Wi-Fi settings at the bottom.
[01:06:54.900 --> 01:06:56.740]   And so now you have one click access
[01:06:56.740 --> 01:06:57.980]   to your Wi-Fi settings right there.
[01:06:57.980 --> 01:07:00.660]   - That's great, that's handy, that's a nice tip.
[01:07:00.660 --> 01:07:02.660]   Gina, you gotta write a book on this, this is great.
[01:07:02.660 --> 01:07:05.140]   - Yeah, she can do it in about a week, I think.
[01:07:05.140 --> 01:07:07.340]   - Yeah. (laughing)
[01:07:07.340 --> 01:07:11.340]   - But what I got one odd thing, I tried to set up a Google voice,
[01:07:11.340 --> 01:07:14.860]   voicemail, and it's told me your network carrier
[01:07:14.860 --> 01:07:16.380]   is not configured for voicemail.
[01:07:16.380 --> 01:07:18.660]   - Huh?
[01:07:18.660 --> 01:07:20.060]   - Are you on T-Mobile?
[01:07:20.060 --> 01:07:21.060]   - Yeah, you're--
[01:07:21.060 --> 01:07:23.260]   - You know, I replaced, one of the things I love about this
[01:07:23.260 --> 01:07:27.100]   is I was able to replace T-Mobile's voicemail
[01:07:27.100 --> 01:07:28.100]   and everything with Google Voice.
[01:07:28.100 --> 01:07:30.020]   I just use Google Voice for the voicemail.
[01:07:30.020 --> 01:07:32.340]   It's my voicemail application.
[01:07:32.340 --> 01:07:33.980]   You're getting some weird anomaly there.
[01:07:33.980 --> 01:07:34.820]   - Okay, that's fun.
[01:07:34.820 --> 01:07:36.580]   - It's strange because when it prompted me, I just hit,
[01:07:36.580 --> 01:07:38.140]   yes, set up voicemail and I did it.
[01:07:38.140 --> 01:07:38.980]   - Did it, did it?
[01:07:38.980 --> 01:07:43.900]   - I'm gonna go to Google.com/voice in a regular browser
[01:07:43.900 --> 01:07:45.940]   on your desktop and then you can configure it there.
[01:07:45.940 --> 01:07:47.740]   You just have to give it your T-Mobile number
[01:07:47.740 --> 01:07:48.580]   and I'll-- - Oh, okay.
[01:07:48.580 --> 01:07:49.580]   - Or you.
[01:07:49.580 --> 01:07:51.060]   - One more question, what was it?
[01:07:51.060 --> 01:07:55.300]   Oh, my contacts, is there any way to export my contacts
[01:07:55.300 --> 01:07:58.460]   from my Apple, from my Mac?
[01:07:58.460 --> 01:07:59.740]   'Cause that's where I have my phone number.
[01:07:59.740 --> 01:08:01.180]   - Do you have Snow Leopard?
[01:08:01.180 --> 01:08:02.020]   - Mm-hmm.
[01:08:02.020 --> 01:08:02.860]   - Yeah.
[01:08:02.860 --> 01:08:05.620]   - In your address book, you sync it with your Google account.
[01:08:05.620 --> 01:08:06.460]   - You can now.
[01:08:06.460 --> 01:08:08.020]   - That was something new in Snow Leopard.
[01:08:08.020 --> 01:08:08.860]   - But I didn't have Snow Leopard.
[01:08:08.860 --> 01:08:09.700]   - Yep.
[01:08:09.700 --> 01:08:12.420]   - All right, okay, so here's the story guys.
[01:08:12.420 --> 01:08:16.620]   Thursday, I called the company in the instructions
[01:08:16.620 --> 01:08:18.700]   and I got a return authorization code.
[01:08:18.700 --> 01:08:20.780]   - Oh, Jeff, you're breaking my heart.
[01:08:20.780 --> 01:08:24.100]   - I'm, well, that's where I am right now.
[01:08:24.100 --> 01:08:25.260]   You've done it.
[01:08:25.260 --> 01:08:27.820]   (laughing)
[01:08:27.820 --> 01:08:29.220]   - I'll tell you, Gina, do you--
[01:08:29.220 --> 01:08:30.620]   - I don't know if it's gonna be my main phone
[01:08:30.620 --> 01:08:33.540]   'cause it's still a lot of night.
[01:08:33.540 --> 01:08:34.900]   - Oh, it's too many--
[01:08:34.900 --> 01:08:36.260]   - It's still a little rough.
[01:08:36.260 --> 01:08:37.100]   It is, it's still a little rough.
[01:08:37.100 --> 01:08:37.940]   - I find it rough at all.
[01:08:37.940 --> 01:08:41.260]   I think that that's mostly a mismatch between expectations.
[01:08:41.260 --> 01:08:44.140]   I find it very straightforward, easy to use,
[01:08:44.140 --> 01:08:45.340]   and once you use it for a while,
[01:08:45.340 --> 01:08:48.020]   I find it more intuitive than the iPhone.
[01:08:48.020 --> 01:08:49.020]   - But you're still capable of using it.
[01:08:49.020 --> 01:08:50.940]   - Once you use it for a while, this is the thing.
[01:08:50.940 --> 01:08:53.460]   I think it has a learning curve that the iPhone just doesn't.
[01:08:53.460 --> 01:08:55.820]   And I think that the iPhone has sort of set expectations
[01:08:55.820 --> 01:08:57.980]   on what app phones should look like.
[01:08:57.980 --> 01:08:59.860]   So I think when someone switches from iPhone
[01:08:59.860 --> 01:09:01.820]   to Android, it's like, what is it?
[01:09:01.820 --> 01:09:04.500]   If I grew, John Gruber has been cracking me up
[01:09:04.500 --> 01:09:06.580]   'cause someone gave him a Nexus One to play with
[01:09:06.580 --> 01:09:09.020]   and he's been tweeting the most sort of sarcastic
[01:09:09.020 --> 01:09:10.500]   (laughing)
[01:09:10.500 --> 01:09:12.620]   things about the Nexus One.
[01:09:12.620 --> 01:09:16.100]   He's a total SD and loves Apple products.
[01:09:16.100 --> 01:09:18.740]   So it's kind of funny to listen to his impressions
[01:09:18.740 --> 01:09:20.500]   of Nexus One as he tries different things out.
[01:09:20.500 --> 01:09:21.660]   - I think that's big a tree.
[01:09:21.660 --> 01:09:24.260]   I think this is more elegant than the iPhone.
[01:09:24.260 --> 01:09:26.020]   Believe me, I'm open-minded and I believe
[01:09:26.020 --> 01:09:29.260]   this is more elegant in every way than the iPhone.
[01:09:29.260 --> 01:09:30.860]   - That's the thing that I do.
[01:09:30.860 --> 01:09:33.700]   - What Gina just proved my point against you, Leo, I think,
[01:09:33.700 --> 01:09:36.500]   is that it's what I said, I think last week,
[01:09:36.500 --> 01:09:40.740]   that Apple tries so hard to think like we do
[01:09:40.740 --> 01:09:42.620]   that we don't have to think too.
[01:09:42.620 --> 01:09:44.180]   - I feel constrained by the iPhone.
[01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:47.740]   The fact that I can only put an icon on the desktop
[01:09:47.740 --> 01:09:50.340]   is a huge constraint and really limits what I can do
[01:09:50.340 --> 01:09:51.660]   with the phone's display.
[01:09:51.660 --> 01:09:52.500]   Things like that.
[01:09:52.500 --> 01:09:53.580]   - Is your Mustang a stick shift?
[01:09:53.580 --> 01:09:54.500]   - Yeah.
[01:09:54.500 --> 01:09:55.420]   - Yeah, you say, well, there it is.
[01:09:55.420 --> 01:09:56.420]   (laughing)
[01:09:56.420 --> 01:09:57.980]   - No, no, I think the iPhone,
[01:09:57.980 --> 01:10:00.940]   if you use this phone for a month and went back to the iPhone,
[01:10:00.940 --> 01:10:02.100]   you would see what I'm seeing,
[01:10:02.100 --> 01:10:04.820]   which is the iPhone feels antiquated compared to this.
[01:10:04.820 --> 01:10:07.940]   I really feel like it's constrained compared to this.
[01:10:07.940 --> 01:10:09.500]   I really do, Jeff.
[01:10:09.500 --> 01:10:10.500]   - Yeah, yeah, I believe that.
[01:10:10.500 --> 01:10:13.660]   - Gina, have you seen this thing when you press and hold?
[01:10:13.660 --> 01:10:15.820]   I love the, there are a few things in two one I really like.
[01:10:15.820 --> 01:10:18.660]   These little ellipsees on the left and right that let me go.
[01:10:18.660 --> 01:10:20.180]   But if you press and hold,
[01:10:20.180 --> 01:10:23.060]   you get a thumbnail of the home screens?
[01:10:23.060 --> 01:10:24.820]   - No.
[01:10:24.820 --> 01:10:25.660]   - Oh, this is so sweet.
[01:10:25.660 --> 01:10:27.500]   - I didn't see that, wait a second.
[01:10:27.500 --> 01:10:28.380]   - What button are you pressing?
[01:10:28.380 --> 01:10:30.060]   - So you know, on the bottom of your phone,
[01:10:30.060 --> 01:10:32.620]   you have the ellipsees that let you go to a different screen.
[01:10:32.620 --> 01:10:33.460]   - Right?
[01:10:33.460 --> 01:10:34.340]   - Press and hold it.
[01:10:34.340 --> 01:10:36.060]   - Oh, that's a new one to me.
[01:10:36.060 --> 01:10:37.340]   - Yes, that's a new one too one.
[01:10:37.340 --> 01:10:38.180]   Isn't that slick?
[01:10:38.180 --> 01:10:39.020]   - See, that's the point of thinking about this.
[01:10:39.020 --> 01:10:40.460]   This is so meant for engineers.
[01:10:40.460 --> 01:10:41.300]   It's, it's, it's.
[01:10:41.300 --> 01:10:42.140]   - No, it's not.
[01:10:42.140 --> 01:10:42.980]   It's not.
[01:10:42.980 --> 01:10:43.820]   - It's not.
[01:10:43.820 --> 01:10:44.660]   - You know what?
[01:10:44.660 --> 01:10:45.500]   - It's the joy.
[01:10:45.500 --> 01:10:48.620]   - You poisoned your mind with this iPhone thing, Jeff.
[01:10:48.620 --> 01:10:51.860]   You need to, you need to get away from it.
[01:10:51.860 --> 01:10:53.660]   - See, but what do you use?
[01:10:53.660 --> 01:10:54.580]   What's your phone?
[01:10:54.580 --> 01:10:57.060]   - I have an iPhone, but I hate it.
[01:10:57.060 --> 01:10:59.540]   - Okay, Siva, this is the phone for you.
[01:10:59.540 --> 01:11:02.260]   - Well, except that I live in the middle of nowhere
[01:11:02.260 --> 01:11:04.060]   where T-Mobile doesn't work very well.
[01:11:04.060 --> 01:11:05.620]   - That's the biggest drawback.
[01:11:05.620 --> 01:11:08.220]   - T-Mobile's great in Prague and Budapest,
[01:11:08.220 --> 01:11:11.860]   but it's not good in places like rural Virginia, Vermont,
[01:11:11.860 --> 01:11:12.780]   Westchester County.
[01:11:12.780 --> 01:11:14.860]   - And it's the opposite for Verizon, unfortunately.
[01:11:14.860 --> 01:11:16.620]   Works great where you are, but not Prague.
[01:11:16.620 --> 01:11:18.100]   - I lived in New York for a long time.
[01:11:18.100 --> 01:11:18.940]   You use T-Mobile.
[01:11:18.940 --> 01:11:20.380]   It was beautiful in the city,
[01:11:20.380 --> 01:11:22.020]   but as soon as I got to Westchester didn't work,
[01:11:22.020 --> 01:11:23.500]   as soon as I got to Vermont, I didn't work.
[01:11:23.500 --> 01:11:24.860]   It was great in Europe, and that's why I had it.
[01:11:24.860 --> 01:11:27.380]   I was spending more time in Europe than in most places
[01:11:27.380 --> 01:11:28.220]   in the United States.
[01:11:28.220 --> 01:11:30.940]   I moved here, had to break my contract
[01:11:30.940 --> 01:11:33.900]   for both my wife's phone and my phone with T-Mobile,
[01:11:33.900 --> 01:11:35.580]   had to then sign up with AT&T
[01:11:35.580 --> 01:11:37.580]   so I could get a phone that would work in Europe.
[01:11:37.580 --> 01:11:40.900]   Used a BlackBerry for a year till the track ball broke.
[01:11:40.900 --> 01:11:43.020]   My wife went to the first generation of iPhone.
[01:11:43.020 --> 01:11:46.660]   When it came time for me to replace that BlackBerry,
[01:11:46.660 --> 01:11:48.820]   they gave me a great deal, I couldn't refuse it,
[01:11:48.820 --> 01:11:52.060]   I wanted to figure out why my wife liked the iPhone so much.
[01:11:52.060 --> 01:11:57.060]   I love the apps, I hate all of the Apple native services.
[01:11:57.060 --> 01:12:02.740]   I hate being imprisoned by this box.
[01:12:02.740 --> 01:12:06.340]   - That's what this is, this is open ideologically.
[01:12:06.340 --> 01:12:08.020]   - Idealized, I'm totally with the Gphone,
[01:12:08.020 --> 01:12:08.860]   but I don't look at it.
[01:12:08.860 --> 01:12:10.300]   - But it's not a sacrifice, Jeff.
[01:12:10.300 --> 01:12:11.180]   That's what the problem is.
[01:12:11.180 --> 01:12:12.900]   You think this is a sacrifice to be open.
[01:12:12.900 --> 01:12:13.740]   This is a--
[01:12:13.740 --> 01:12:14.820]   - I don't wanna think about it.
[01:12:14.820 --> 01:12:16.380]   - Look it, I'm gonna show you the killer app.
[01:12:16.380 --> 01:12:18.780]   This is it, this is the killer app.
[01:12:18.780 --> 01:12:19.620]   Are you ready?
[01:12:19.620 --> 01:12:20.460]   All right, I'm in Twitter,
[01:12:20.460 --> 01:12:22.820]   but it would work anywhere that you can type.
[01:12:22.820 --> 01:12:24.980]   When you hit the typing key,
[01:12:24.980 --> 01:12:27.700]   you notice there's a little microphone.
[01:12:27.700 --> 01:12:31.940]   I am dictating my tweet right now.
[01:12:31.940 --> 01:12:35.740]   You can dictate anywhere.
[01:12:35.740 --> 01:12:36.620]   - Okay, I want this.
[01:12:36.620 --> 01:12:39.940]   - Anywhere there is a keyboard.
[01:12:39.940 --> 01:12:40.780]   And it does--
[01:12:40.780 --> 01:12:42.860]   - Put on the wiki, Fred Wilson did that
[01:12:42.860 --> 01:12:44.140]   for a whole blog post.
[01:12:44.140 --> 01:12:45.060]   - And it's, you have to--
[01:12:45.060 --> 01:12:46.580]   - You're almost English.
[01:12:46.580 --> 01:12:47.500]   - No, no, no, no.
[01:12:47.500 --> 01:12:49.420]   First of all, you do have to train yourself,
[01:12:49.420 --> 01:12:50.260]   it's not perfect.
[01:12:50.260 --> 01:12:51.100]   You have to be online
[01:12:51.100 --> 01:12:54.100]   'cause it uses the Google servers for the recognition.
[01:12:54.100 --> 01:12:57.300]   You have to speak slowly and enunciate clearly.
[01:12:57.300 --> 01:12:59.140]   - You're how easy it is for me, Leo.
[01:12:59.140 --> 01:13:01.340]   - Yeah, and I'll give you another one.
[01:13:01.340 --> 01:13:04.260]   You stop at every period because it doesn't do periods.
[01:13:04.260 --> 01:13:05.500]   You have to stop-- - For it.
[01:13:05.500 --> 01:13:07.500]   - You have to say a sentence,
[01:13:07.500 --> 01:13:10.940]   let it recognize it, check it, press the period key
[01:13:10.940 --> 01:13:13.620]   and go on and I have had perfect dictation.
[01:13:13.620 --> 01:13:15.860]   I've been tweeting with it for a couple of days
[01:13:15.860 --> 01:13:17.500]   and text messaging for a couple of days.
[01:13:17.500 --> 01:13:19.580]   That to me is, that's the killer app, it's done.
[01:13:19.580 --> 01:13:21.540]   - So here's the question I pop with the wiki.
[01:13:21.540 --> 01:13:23.860]   Are we going to have a keyboard less world
[01:13:23.860 --> 01:13:25.700]   or is that like having a paperless office
[01:13:25.700 --> 01:13:26.540]   that will never come?
[01:13:26.540 --> 01:13:27.540]   - No, I think it solves that problem,
[01:13:27.540 --> 01:13:28.380]   although you feel like a dork
[01:13:28.380 --> 01:13:29.940]   when you're tweeting in public.
[01:13:29.940 --> 01:13:32.460]   - One extra tip for the voice to text.
[01:13:32.460 --> 01:13:34.180]   If you don't, if you're driving
[01:13:34.180 --> 01:13:35.900]   or you don't want to look at the keyboard
[01:13:35.900 --> 01:13:38.220]   to find that little tiny microphone key,
[01:13:38.220 --> 01:13:40.300]   you can swipe your finger across the keyboard
[01:13:40.300 --> 01:13:41.540]   to activate it, to start.
[01:13:41.540 --> 01:13:43.340]   - Oh, that's a great tip.
[01:13:43.340 --> 01:13:45.860]   Now when-- - Again, it's OS by Easter Egg.
[01:13:45.860 --> 01:13:47.300]   - Well, yeah, is it-- - Yeah, it is a whole question.
[01:13:47.300 --> 01:13:49.900]   - Is it thoroughly documented somewhere, Gina,
[01:13:49.900 --> 01:13:51.740]   or is it just we discover it and share it?
[01:13:51.740 --> 01:13:54.620]   - I have just discovered this one from one of my,
[01:13:54.620 --> 01:13:57.700]   actually I discovered it in one of the Google Android
[01:13:57.700 --> 01:13:59.220]   tutorial videos.
[01:13:59.220 --> 01:14:01.860]   Another good one is if the keyboard is up
[01:14:01.860 --> 01:14:03.700]   and you want it to go away, sometimes it blocks
[01:14:03.700 --> 01:14:04.980]   like the remember me checkbox,
[01:14:04.980 --> 01:14:06.900]   you can swipe down to put it down.
[01:14:06.900 --> 01:14:08.420]   - Oh, that's cool, 'cause I'm always pressing
[01:14:08.420 --> 01:14:10.100]   the back button to do that.
[01:14:10.100 --> 01:14:11.340]   Swipe down. - Yeah, kind of have to swipe.
[01:14:11.340 --> 01:14:12.980]   There you go, kind of have to swipe quickly.
[01:14:12.980 --> 01:14:14.660]   But you know, listen, Leo, I'm thrilled
[01:14:14.660 --> 01:14:17.260]   that you feel this way, but I'm, I agree with Jeff.
[01:14:17.260 --> 01:14:22.260]   - I love it. - I still feel like it is
[01:14:22.260 --> 01:14:24.020]   an operating system designed by engineers.
[01:14:24.020 --> 01:14:24.860]   I think that's clear.
[01:14:24.860 --> 01:14:26.900]   I think that it has multiple layers of hierarchy,
[01:14:26.900 --> 01:14:29.020]   which the iPhone doesn't have for better or for worse.
[01:14:29.020 --> 01:14:31.940]   I like it because it gives me more options.
[01:14:31.940 --> 01:14:33.940]   But the bad news is that things get hidden.
[01:14:33.940 --> 01:14:36.140]   And I do think it's a little bit like OS by Easter Egg.
[01:14:36.140 --> 01:14:37.780]   Like I had no idea that if you tapped and hold
[01:14:37.780 --> 01:14:40.220]   those little ellipses that that could come up.
[01:14:40.220 --> 01:14:41.740]   And in fact, to add to that tip,
[01:14:41.740 --> 01:14:43.820]   if you tap and hold the home button,
[01:14:43.820 --> 01:14:46.140]   you can see all your currently running apps.
[01:14:46.140 --> 01:14:48.380]   It's sort of like-- - Oh yeah, isn't that nice?
[01:14:48.380 --> 01:14:50.380]   - Alt-Tab on the windows.
[01:14:50.380 --> 01:14:51.780]   So I mean, these things are hidden.
[01:14:51.780 --> 01:14:52.940]   They're not obvious.
[01:14:52.940 --> 01:14:55.660]   I get a lot of joy from discovering this stuff.
[01:14:55.660 --> 01:14:58.980]   And like, you know, the discovery time with an iPhone
[01:14:58.980 --> 01:14:59.820]   is pretty short.
[01:14:59.820 --> 01:15:01.660]   - 'Cause it doesn't do diddly-doo.
[01:15:01.660 --> 01:15:03.140]   - 'Cause it doesn't do as much.
[01:15:03.140 --> 01:15:04.340]   But at the same time, do you--
[01:15:04.340 --> 01:15:05.660]   - Because it did less than a--
[01:15:05.660 --> 01:15:06.740]   - That's the time.
[01:15:06.740 --> 01:15:08.300]   - It went to the work for us.
[01:15:08.300 --> 01:15:09.620]   - You know what, Jeff, I'm telling you,
[01:15:09.620 --> 01:15:11.940]   and this is the same thing we said last week.
[01:15:11.940 --> 01:15:13.380]   But you may never get to this point,
[01:15:13.380 --> 01:15:15.140]   but just give it a little more time, Jeff.
[01:15:15.140 --> 01:15:19.860]   - So it seems to me that the iPhone is Baidu
[01:15:19.860 --> 01:15:22.980]   and this phone is Google.
[01:15:22.980 --> 01:15:25.460]   Because basically Baidu satisfies most people in China
[01:15:25.460 --> 01:15:27.300]   for most of their consumer interests,
[01:15:27.300 --> 01:15:28.700]   and they're not willing to dig deep,
[01:15:28.700 --> 01:15:31.860]   and they just want the easy access to the music.
[01:15:31.860 --> 01:15:35.180]   And, you know, if you're a specialized user,
[01:15:35.180 --> 01:15:37.620]   a little bit more technologically hip,
[01:15:37.620 --> 01:15:39.260]   you might be attracted to Google.
[01:15:39.260 --> 01:15:40.740]   And so you may end up with the same market share.
[01:15:40.740 --> 01:15:42.620]   If Google's lucky, they get the same market share.
[01:15:42.620 --> 01:15:44.620]   - Thanks for bringing us back right around
[01:15:44.620 --> 01:15:45.620]   to the-- - But let me tell you,
[01:15:45.620 --> 01:15:46.620]   this is my great hope. - Good to tell you.
[01:15:46.620 --> 01:15:48.540]   - Of all the things that Google has done
[01:15:48.540 --> 01:15:51.820]   and put itself into in the past five years,
[01:15:51.820 --> 01:15:55.540]   the mobile phone environment is, to me, the most exciting.
[01:15:55.540 --> 01:15:56.380]   - Yes.
[01:15:56.380 --> 01:15:59.060]   - And the one in which it can make the most difference
[01:15:59.060 --> 01:16:01.220]   in my life and in the world.
[01:16:01.220 --> 01:16:05.100]   Because the mobile phone system in the United States
[01:16:05.100 --> 01:16:08.660]   is embarrassing and cruel and expensive.
[01:16:08.660 --> 01:16:12.100]   I mean, I ended up that switch from T-Mobile to AT&T
[01:16:12.100 --> 01:16:15.100]   cost me about $1,200 all said and done
[01:16:15.100 --> 01:16:18.020]   with all the broken contracts and new box-
[01:16:18.020 --> 01:16:18.900]   - Let me point out something,
[01:16:18.900 --> 01:16:22.740]   both AT&T and Verizon this week announced new rate plans
[01:16:22.740 --> 01:16:27.460]   because T-Mobile's pay as you go rate plan is starting.
[01:16:27.460 --> 01:16:30.500]   I'm telling you, this is the crack in the egg.
[01:16:30.500 --> 01:16:31.500]   - Finally. - Yeah.
[01:16:31.500 --> 01:16:32.500]   And--
[01:16:32.500 --> 01:16:34.740]   - So do we think Google caused that at T-Mobile?
[01:16:34.740 --> 01:16:36.100]   Do you think that was-- - Totally.
[01:16:36.100 --> 01:16:37.980]   - Yes, it was for this phone.
[01:16:37.980 --> 01:16:39.300]   Yeah, you bet.
[01:16:39.300 --> 01:16:41.740]   - You know, listen, if I'm gonna be,
[01:16:41.740 --> 01:16:43.300]   where the Google fanboy hat,
[01:16:43.300 --> 01:16:45.820]   it's gonna be for this, the phone activities.
[01:16:45.820 --> 01:16:49.780]   What I wanna see though is a real sort of severing
[01:16:49.780 --> 01:16:52.620]   of the habits of long-term contracts,
[01:16:52.620 --> 01:16:56.140]   the idea that phones have to be locked to service carriers.
[01:16:56.140 --> 01:16:57.420]   I mean, those are the sorts of things
[01:16:57.420 --> 01:16:59.500]   that Google really should,
[01:16:59.500 --> 01:17:01.740]   and I think hopefully will play a part in.
[01:17:01.740 --> 01:17:04.460]   - That's why I wish they had put the AT&T frequency
[01:17:04.460 --> 01:17:06.020]   on this phone.
[01:17:06.020 --> 01:17:07.660]   Because I wouldn't have to go to T-Mobile.
[01:17:07.660 --> 01:17:09.140]   I think that was probably a soft to T-Mobile.
[01:17:09.140 --> 01:17:10.940]   - That was, I'm sure, yeah.
[01:17:10.940 --> 01:17:12.540]   The tit for TAT, you know.
[01:17:12.540 --> 01:17:15.220]   - And that was a compromise,
[01:17:15.220 --> 01:17:18.460]   not unlike not showing you Falun Gong.
[01:17:18.460 --> 01:17:19.820]   - Or not putting in multi-touch.
[01:17:19.820 --> 01:17:22.620]   I think, look, they live in this world as we do.
[01:17:22.620 --> 01:17:24.140]   But I, this is--
[01:17:24.140 --> 01:17:24.980]   - Oh, it's their world.
[01:17:24.980 --> 01:17:26.700]   - This is the, we live in Google's,
[01:17:26.700 --> 01:17:28.860]   it's Google's world, we just live in it.
[01:17:28.860 --> 01:17:32.300]   I just, I think this phone is the closest
[01:17:32.300 --> 01:17:34.100]   to an uncompromised phone I've ever seen.
[01:17:34.100 --> 01:17:35.940]   And it's unlocked.
[01:17:35.940 --> 01:17:37.580]   - Any frustrations with it, Leo?
[01:17:37.580 --> 01:17:40.260]   - Well, there are a few apps that I love
[01:17:40.260 --> 01:17:42.460]   on the iPhone like Mint.
[01:17:42.460 --> 01:17:43.300]   - Mint.
[01:17:43.300 --> 01:17:44.140]   - The biggest, you know, the biggest
[01:17:44.140 --> 01:17:45.420]   for a station is no Audible.
[01:17:45.420 --> 01:17:47.180]   But Audible is working with Google.
[01:17:47.180 --> 01:17:48.660]   It's up to Google to provide it.
[01:17:48.660 --> 01:17:49.580]   But Audible's working with them.
[01:17:49.580 --> 01:17:52.860]   And they say this first half of 2010, they'll have it.
[01:17:52.860 --> 01:17:55.220]   That's the biggest thing is I can't, it's not an iPod.
[01:17:55.220 --> 01:17:56.940]   So I can't listen to my audio books.
[01:17:56.940 --> 01:17:58.700]   However, you'll see in my tool of the week,
[01:17:58.700 --> 01:18:00.900]   there is a very good way to sync this,
[01:18:00.900 --> 01:18:02.260]   which I'll talk about.
[01:18:02.260 --> 01:18:03.100]   - So I wanna hear that.
[01:18:03.100 --> 01:18:05.700]   I was gonna say the media management is not as good
[01:18:05.700 --> 01:18:07.180]   as the iPhone to be expected.
[01:18:07.180 --> 01:18:08.940]   - Yeah, but you can mount an SD card
[01:18:08.940 --> 01:18:11.220]   and I put a 16 gig SD card in it.
[01:18:11.220 --> 01:18:12.060]   - That is nice.
[01:18:12.060 --> 01:18:14.460]   There are people that need to be able to add more space
[01:18:14.460 --> 01:18:15.780]   to stores, definitely.
[01:18:15.780 --> 01:18:16.620]   It's fantastic.
[01:18:16.620 --> 01:18:19.580]   But the media player isn't as good as it could be.
[01:18:19.580 --> 01:18:22.140]   One of my problems is sometimes I accidentally tap
[01:18:22.140 --> 01:18:24.900]   one of the buttons on the lower part of the phone
[01:18:24.900 --> 01:18:25.740]   while I'm typing.
[01:18:25.740 --> 01:18:27.220]   That's kind of annoying.
[01:18:27.220 --> 01:18:28.660]   I never did that with the G1
[01:18:28.660 --> 01:18:31.000]   'cause those buttons were hard buttons.
[01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:34.020]   - That is, in fact, these buttons don't seem
[01:18:34.020 --> 01:18:35.140]   as responsive sometime.
[01:18:35.140 --> 01:18:36.860]   And I think that's the same issue
[01:18:36.860 --> 01:18:38.140]   is that they're soft buttons.
[01:18:38.140 --> 01:18:40.140]   So it's kind of part of the touchscreen.
[01:18:40.140 --> 01:18:41.140]   - Well, the funny thing about it is
[01:18:41.140 --> 01:18:42.900]   when I hold the phone in my hand,
[01:18:42.900 --> 01:18:45.340]   I'm fine with the bottom buttons.
[01:18:45.340 --> 01:18:47.980]   But when I put it on a cable and try to hit it,
[01:18:47.980 --> 01:18:49.260]   it somehow doesn't work.
[01:18:49.260 --> 01:18:52.380]   - I'm sure they did that on purpose.
[01:18:52.380 --> 01:18:53.700]   - The other good thing about this
[01:18:53.700 --> 01:18:55.100]   is that it does, correct me if I'm wrong,
[01:18:55.100 --> 01:18:56.420]   this does do flash, right?
[01:18:56.420 --> 01:18:59.340]   - Supposedly it will be able to.
[01:18:59.340 --> 01:19:00.540]   It doesn't come with flash.
[01:19:00.540 --> 01:19:02.140]   - Here's what I found was,
[01:19:02.140 --> 01:19:04.420]   I called into Howard Stern's show on--
[01:19:04.420 --> 01:19:06.900]   - Yeah, by the way, you were on Howard Stern's show.
[01:19:06.900 --> 01:19:07.740]   - Yeah, Thursday.
[01:19:07.740 --> 01:19:08.740]   - How was that?
[01:19:08.740 --> 01:19:09.580]   - It was fine.
[01:19:09.580 --> 01:19:10.420]   I love calling it Howard.
[01:19:10.420 --> 01:19:12.300]   I called in because he was talking about Jay Leno.
[01:19:12.300 --> 01:19:14.460]   And I told him about the time when I gave,
[01:19:14.460 --> 01:19:16.620]   I was T.B. Keringer, T.B. God.
[01:19:16.620 --> 01:19:18.980]   And when Jay premiered on the Tonight Show,
[01:19:18.980 --> 01:19:21.020]   I gave him a bad review and Jay called me.
[01:19:21.020 --> 01:19:23.460]   - What, you did like the show?
[01:19:23.460 --> 01:19:25.100]   (laughing)
[01:19:25.100 --> 01:19:27.300]   - Oh, no Jay, I didn't, what did you like about it?
[01:19:27.300 --> 01:19:29.620]   - I'm like, what did I say to the review, Jay?
[01:19:29.620 --> 01:19:31.780]   - Whichever, tell the truth though,
[01:19:31.780 --> 01:19:33.220]   it was nothing like being on Twitter, right?
[01:19:33.220 --> 01:19:34.140]   I mean, come on.
[01:19:34.140 --> 01:19:35.060]   - Oh, not at all.
[01:19:35.060 --> 01:19:36.060]   - I think it's strippers.
[01:19:36.060 --> 01:19:36.900]   - Do you want some strippers?
[01:19:36.900 --> 01:19:38.380]   We'll get you strippers, whatever you need.
[01:19:38.380 --> 01:19:39.220]   - I did, I did.
[01:19:39.220 --> 01:19:40.980]   I feel very bad.
[01:19:40.980 --> 01:19:41.900]   - No, no, don't worry.
[01:19:41.900 --> 01:19:43.740]   Believe me, I don't want Howard Stern's audience
[01:19:43.740 --> 01:19:44.580]   listening to this show.
[01:19:44.580 --> 01:19:46.060]   - Hey, that's me.
[01:19:46.060 --> 01:19:48.660]   But I mentioned on the air that I'm so frustrated
[01:19:48.660 --> 01:19:50.500]   I can't get Howard on my iPhone.
[01:19:50.500 --> 01:19:52.660]   The hilarious thing was that in minutes,
[01:19:52.660 --> 01:19:54.420]   my email was just Jay.
[01:19:54.420 --> 01:19:55.420]   - Sure, sure.
[01:19:55.420 --> 01:19:56.260]   - You tell me how to do it.
[01:19:56.260 --> 01:19:58.980]   There's a couple applications I'm hesitant to say it out loud
[01:19:58.980 --> 01:20:00.540]   because the Chinese government will go after it.
[01:20:00.540 --> 01:20:02.860]   - There's illegal redirection of the Howard Stern feed.
[01:20:02.860 --> 01:20:04.020]   - Fucking tunes and that kind of stuff.
[01:20:04.020 --> 01:20:05.740]   So it kind of fakes flash.
[01:20:05.740 --> 01:20:10.100]   I went on to the Nexus and went to Sirius
[01:20:10.100 --> 01:20:11.940]   and went to the player, which is a flash player.
[01:20:11.940 --> 01:20:14.380]   And I got pretty far along and seemed to be playing
[01:20:14.380 --> 01:20:16.460]   and then I couldn't hear anything.
[01:20:16.460 --> 01:20:17.300]   - Oh.
[01:20:17.300 --> 01:20:20.700]   - So there's something there.
[01:20:20.700 --> 01:20:22.460]   But I think that's, if you can do flash,
[01:20:22.460 --> 01:20:24.020]   as much as I don't like flash,
[01:20:24.020 --> 01:20:26.260]   getting flash on this, we'll open it up more too.
[01:20:26.260 --> 01:20:29.420]   - There are also people who will legally redirect
[01:20:29.420 --> 01:20:32.500]   the Sirius feed.
[01:20:32.500 --> 01:20:35.340]   - But no, I still had to put in my password.
[01:20:35.340 --> 01:20:36.620]   - Oh, I still had to. - Okay, good.
[01:20:36.620 --> 01:20:39.020]   - Hey, 29 a month to get. - Oh, that's good.
[01:20:39.020 --> 01:20:40.500]   - Online, so it was, you know.
[01:20:40.500 --> 01:20:42.580]   - It was legit. - Sirius lost nothing.
[01:20:42.580 --> 01:20:43.820]   - It was legit. - Oh, that's good.
[01:20:43.820 --> 01:20:45.140]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:20:45.140 --> 01:20:46.140]   - Hey, we're running real long,
[01:20:46.140 --> 01:20:47.620]   but this has been such a great conversation.
[01:20:47.620 --> 01:20:49.580]   Let's quickly get to our tip number and tool,
[01:20:49.580 --> 01:20:52.580]   but after commercial, how about that?
[01:20:52.580 --> 01:20:56.660]   From our friends at Citrix, the folks who do go to meeting
[01:20:56.660 --> 01:20:59.380]   a great solution for people who don't want to travel,
[01:20:59.380 --> 01:21:02.260]   who would like to get more done and travel less,
[01:21:02.260 --> 01:21:06.500]   go to meeting is an indispensable part of how I work today,
[01:21:06.500 --> 01:21:08.860]   and I invite you to give it a try for free.
[01:21:08.860 --> 01:21:11.860]   The idea is using their great remote access technology,
[01:21:11.860 --> 01:21:13.580]   the same technology as in GoToMyPC,
[01:21:13.580 --> 01:21:15.700]   they allow you very quickly, very easily,
[01:21:15.700 --> 01:21:16.980]   a set up online meetings.
[01:21:16.980 --> 01:21:19.220]   You can be on the conference call once you've got this
[01:21:19.220 --> 01:21:20.860]   installed, and in fact, you can install it right now,
[01:21:20.860 --> 01:21:24.340]   quickly, go to meeting.com/twig, 30 days free.
[01:21:24.340 --> 01:21:25.740]   And while you're on the conference call,
[01:21:25.740 --> 01:21:27.620]   you click a button, you start the meeting,
[01:21:27.620 --> 01:21:28.780]   and you say, here's the meeting ID,
[01:21:28.780 --> 01:21:31.740]   go to go to meeting.com, now you'll see my desktop.
[01:21:31.740 --> 01:21:33.540]   You can see my Mac or my PC desktop.
[01:21:33.540 --> 01:21:36.540]   You can see the presentation, the spreadsheet,
[01:21:36.540 --> 01:21:38.740]   the websites, whatever it is we're talking about.
[01:21:38.740 --> 01:21:40.860]   You can share control so you can collaborate.
[01:21:40.860 --> 01:21:43.100]   You can even, once you've got it running,
[01:21:43.100 --> 01:21:44.580]   you can even, they can give you control
[01:21:44.580 --> 01:21:46.220]   of their computer, so your clients can say,
[01:21:46.220 --> 01:21:49.420]   well, here's my thinking, what do you think?
[01:21:49.420 --> 01:21:50.700]   It's so powerful.
[01:21:50.700 --> 01:21:53.780]   It truly is indispensable for sales, product demos,
[01:21:53.780 --> 01:21:55.940]   training sessions, collaboration,
[01:21:55.940 --> 01:21:59.380]   and even one meeting a month will save you
[01:21:59.380 --> 01:22:01.740]   over a plane ticket or even a drive across town.
[01:22:01.740 --> 01:22:04.580]   It's just $49 a month for as many meetings as you want,
[01:22:04.580 --> 01:22:07.980]   as long as you want, including phone and voice over IP
[01:22:07.980 --> 01:22:09.220]   conferencing.
[01:22:09.220 --> 01:22:10.260]   I want you to try it right now.
[01:22:10.260 --> 01:22:13.140]   Go to go to meeting.com/twig,
[01:22:13.140 --> 01:22:14.700]   and try it free for 30 days.
[01:22:14.700 --> 01:22:16.060]   You're gonna love it.
[01:22:16.060 --> 01:22:19.380]   Go to meeting.com/twig.
[01:22:19.380 --> 01:22:23.980]   And now time for Gina's tool of the week.
[01:22:23.980 --> 01:22:24.820]   - Tip.
[01:22:24.820 --> 01:22:27.100]   - I'm sorry, you're a tip, I'm a tool.
[01:22:27.100 --> 01:22:29.340]   I always forget, I don't wanna be a tool, but I am.
[01:22:29.340 --> 01:22:31.460]   (laughs)
[01:22:31.460 --> 01:22:34.020]   Quick tip this week, Google has just launched
[01:22:34.020 --> 01:22:37.860]   the ability for you to upload files up to,
[01:22:37.860 --> 01:22:41.860]   I believe, 250 megabytes in size to Google Docs.
[01:22:41.860 --> 01:22:45.380]   So Google Docs becomes kind of this portable storage place
[01:22:45.380 --> 01:22:46.220]   to bring stuff.
[01:22:46.220 --> 01:22:48.820]   Now, I think you get one gigabyte of space,
[01:22:48.820 --> 01:22:49.660]   so you can zip up--
[01:22:49.660 --> 01:22:50.980]   - But you can buy more, right?
[01:22:50.980 --> 01:22:53.020]   - For 25 cents. - You can buy more, yeah.
[01:22:53.020 --> 01:22:54.540]   I think you get one gigabyte for free,
[01:22:54.540 --> 01:22:57.860]   and you can buy more, so you can upload big old zip files
[01:22:57.860 --> 01:23:00.460]   or music files or something, and put them in Google Docs.
[01:23:00.460 --> 01:23:04.180]   The attachment size limit is, I believe, bigger
[01:23:04.180 --> 01:23:05.940]   than on Gmail and most email clients.
[01:23:05.940 --> 01:23:08.940]   So it's a similar kind of thing to Dropbox,
[01:23:08.940 --> 01:23:12.380]   or even like an online backup, like Mosi or Carbonite.
[01:23:12.380 --> 01:23:14.140]   Just this place in the cloud, the store your stuff,
[01:23:14.140 --> 01:23:15.780]   and get access to from any computer.
[01:23:15.780 --> 01:23:18.820]   And they said that they're rolling this out
[01:23:18.820 --> 01:23:19.700]   over the next few weeks.
[01:23:19.700 --> 01:23:22.140]   So you may not have in your Google Docs account right now,
[01:23:22.140 --> 01:23:24.660]   but when you do, I think it'll be in a button
[01:23:24.660 --> 01:23:27.020]   that just has upload next to the,
[01:23:27.020 --> 01:23:28.820]   right under the Google Docs logo,
[01:23:28.820 --> 01:23:31.980]   and you can choose your file and stuff it there.
[01:23:31.980 --> 01:23:33.460]   - So if you still-- - Just in time,
[01:23:33.460 --> 01:23:35.260]   just in time for the Chinese cover writing.
[01:23:35.260 --> 01:23:36.100]   - Exactly.
[01:23:36.100 --> 01:23:36.940]   (laughing)
[01:23:36.940 --> 01:23:37.780]   Get your stuff.
[01:23:37.780 --> 01:23:39.460]   I actually thought about making this my tool, Gina,
[01:23:39.460 --> 01:23:41.780]   and then I thought, maybe this wouldn't be the week to do that.
[01:23:41.780 --> 01:23:44.380]   (laughing)
[01:23:44.380 --> 01:23:47.260]   Get all your stuff up there so the Chinese can see it quickly.
[01:23:47.260 --> 01:23:49.140]   - Yeah, make sure it's as much sensitive information
[01:23:49.140 --> 01:23:50.700]   as possible. - Absolutely.
[01:23:50.700 --> 01:23:52.820]   - Social security numbers, bank accounts.
[01:23:52.820 --> 01:23:56.700]   - I really do wonder if some companies will have
[01:23:56.700 --> 01:23:59.540]   second thoughts about using Google Docs because of this.
[01:23:59.540 --> 01:24:00.380]   I imagine.
[01:24:00.380 --> 01:24:02.660]   - I think that the Twitter hack should have done that already.
[01:24:02.660 --> 01:24:03.900]   - Yeah, no kidding.
[01:24:03.900 --> 01:24:05.420]   - I mean, that was pretty embarrassing.
[01:24:05.420 --> 01:24:07.580]   And to have those two companies involved
[01:24:07.580 --> 01:24:09.580]   in something just so obvious.
[01:24:09.580 --> 01:24:13.100]   I mean, apparently it was just a dumb password issue, right?
[01:24:13.100 --> 01:24:13.940]   - Right, exactly.
[01:24:13.940 --> 01:24:15.740]   - I mean, it wasn't even a forced hack.
[01:24:15.740 --> 01:24:17.020]   I mean, I proved forced hack.
[01:24:17.020 --> 01:24:17.860]   It was just a--
[01:24:17.860 --> 01:24:19.300]   - One of the chances that next week
[01:24:19.300 --> 01:24:20.460]   the New York Times will report
[01:24:20.460 --> 01:24:23.380]   that Google's password was password.
[01:24:23.380 --> 01:24:25.940]   (laughing)
[01:24:25.940 --> 01:24:27.140]   - No.
[01:24:27.140 --> 01:24:27.980]   - No.
[01:24:27.980 --> 01:24:28.980]   - No, it was Marissa.
[01:24:28.980 --> 01:24:31.860]   (laughing)
[01:24:31.860 --> 01:24:34.580]   - Jeff Jarvis, time for your number of the week.
[01:24:34.580 --> 01:24:36.900]   - Well, according to Flurry,
[01:24:36.900 --> 01:24:38.620]   I don't even know if they're a software company,
[01:24:38.620 --> 01:24:40.540]   they put out a report, I don't know,
[01:24:40.540 --> 01:24:44.620]   about the relative first week sales of phones.
[01:24:44.620 --> 01:24:48.860]   And the Nexus One, they say sold 20,000.
[01:24:48.860 --> 01:24:50.020]   - Not many.
[01:24:50.020 --> 01:24:51.780]   - The Droid 250,000.
[01:24:51.780 --> 01:24:54.900]   Of course, the Droid had benefit of considerable advertising,
[01:24:54.900 --> 01:24:57.900]   not just the Google Home page, but also--
[01:24:57.900 --> 01:25:00.620]   - And Verizon, what's not for that.
[01:25:00.620 --> 01:25:01.460]   - That's true.
[01:25:01.460 --> 01:25:02.700]   - And then, however, you know,
[01:25:02.700 --> 01:25:05.380]   I'm fanboy that I still am for Apple.
[01:25:05.380 --> 01:25:08.540]   The iPhone first week was 1.6 million.
[01:25:08.540 --> 01:25:10.100]   (laughing)
[01:25:10.100 --> 01:25:12.620]   But, you know, which is, by the way,
[01:25:12.620 --> 01:25:15.300]   can I just point out that Nokia sells more phones
[01:25:15.300 --> 01:25:16.860]   in a day than Apple sells in a month?
[01:25:16.860 --> 01:25:20.100]   Just, you know, if you're going by numbers alone,
[01:25:20.100 --> 01:25:22.980]   people are still buying the Nokia candy bar phone.
[01:25:22.980 --> 01:25:23.820]   - Is that true?
[01:25:23.820 --> 01:25:24.660]   - Oh yeah.
[01:25:24.660 --> 01:25:25.860]   - In Europe, right?
[01:25:25.860 --> 01:25:26.700]   I mean, globally, this is--
[01:25:26.700 --> 01:25:27.540]   - It's not here, yeah.
[01:25:27.540 --> 01:25:28.380]   - Roll everywhere.
[01:25:28.380 --> 01:25:29.620]   - Leo, you know what I saw today?
[01:25:29.620 --> 01:25:31.420]   I remember a few months ago, you had talked about
[01:25:31.420 --> 01:25:33.620]   how much you wanted the new super Nokia.
[01:25:33.620 --> 01:25:35.180]   - And 900, I have it, yeah.
[01:25:35.180 --> 01:25:38.180]   - So, apparently, Apple is putting forth
[01:25:38.180 --> 01:25:39.860]   a pretty strong patent challenge
[01:25:39.860 --> 01:25:41.340]   to keep it out of North America.
[01:25:41.340 --> 01:25:42.660]   - Oh, interesting.
[01:25:42.660 --> 01:25:44.860]   Well, Nokia sued Apple, so it's a--
[01:25:44.860 --> 01:25:46.260]   - Yeah, over something else, right, yeah.
[01:25:46.260 --> 01:25:48.860]   So, this apparently, like, dueling patent battles right now
[01:25:48.860 --> 01:25:50.900]   to limit competition.
[01:25:50.900 --> 01:25:53.980]   - Well, and Kodak is now suing both Google and Apple
[01:25:53.980 --> 01:25:57.340]   over photo displaying.
[01:25:57.340 --> 01:25:59.780]   If you can't compete in this country, what do you do?
[01:25:59.780 --> 01:26:00.620]   You sue.
[01:26:00.620 --> 01:26:01.460]   - Well, that's the thing, like,
[01:26:01.460 --> 01:26:03.100]   let me tell you, the patent system right now
[01:26:03.100 --> 01:26:08.100]   is so tangled, so thick with all of these,
[01:26:08.100 --> 01:26:10.700]   you know, broad and obvious patents
[01:26:10.700 --> 01:26:15.020]   that were approved, you know, five, 10, 15 years ago,
[01:26:15.020 --> 01:26:18.300]   just on a basic memo back of a napkin.
[01:26:18.300 --> 01:26:22.620]   And you have these, you know, these patent troll companies,
[01:26:22.620 --> 01:26:25.940]   like the one that almost took down research in motion,
[01:26:25.940 --> 01:26:27.620]   you know, gathering up all these patents,
[01:26:27.620 --> 01:26:31.020]   finding some way to hold somebody hostage.
[01:26:31.020 --> 01:26:33.220]   And it's a huge drag, and we pay for it.
[01:26:33.220 --> 01:26:37.100]   Who knows how many dollars out of the 500
[01:26:37.100 --> 01:26:39.860]   it's gonna cost you for an open droid, you know,
[01:26:39.860 --> 01:26:43.340]   an unopened droid actually has to go
[01:26:43.340 --> 01:26:46.060]   for these hostage patents, right,
[01:26:46.060 --> 01:26:48.660]   a sort of extortion that's built into the price
[01:26:48.660 --> 01:26:49.620]   of almost anything.
[01:26:49.620 --> 01:26:51.140]   - Hey, Jean, do you think, you know,
[01:26:51.140 --> 01:26:53.020]   oh, you never used a droid, I used a droid.
[01:26:53.020 --> 01:26:55.380]   I do think that the Nexus one is better than the droid.
[01:26:55.380 --> 01:26:58.220]   It's faster, it's got a gigahertz snapdragon
[01:26:58.220 --> 01:27:00.460]   in it, which really makes a big difference.
[01:27:00.460 --> 01:27:01.940]   - And it doesn't have a big,
[01:27:01.940 --> 01:27:03.700]   clunky keyboard that's not really easy to use
[01:27:03.700 --> 01:27:04.540]   to begin with. - Forget the clunky
[01:27:04.540 --> 01:27:06.020]   keyboard that we don't want.
[01:27:06.020 --> 01:27:07.660]   Better screen, I think it's a better choice.
[01:27:07.660 --> 01:27:10.460]   And 2.1 is an improvement.
[01:27:10.460 --> 01:27:11.340]   - Yeah, 2.1 is great.
[01:27:11.340 --> 01:27:13.220]   And hopefully the droid users will get 2.1,
[01:27:13.220 --> 01:27:15.300]   I'll get pushed down over the air to the droid user soon.
[01:27:15.300 --> 01:27:17.340]   - I hope so, yeah, 'cause it's nice.
[01:27:17.340 --> 01:27:22.780]   My tip of the week is for people who have Android,
[01:27:22.780 --> 01:27:25.460]   not necessarily an Nexus one, but Android,
[01:27:25.460 --> 01:27:27.060]   and they're saying, well, I really wish, you know,
[01:27:27.060 --> 01:27:31.780]   I could sync my songs, my iTunes music, that kind of thing.
[01:27:31.780 --> 01:27:34.140]   It comes to us from DVD John,
[01:27:34.140 --> 01:27:38.620]   who's, I guess, gone legit, or semi-legit anyways.
[01:27:38.620 --> 01:27:41.060]   Companies called Double Twist, DoubleTwist.com.
[01:27:41.060 --> 01:27:43.540]   This is a free program for Mac or Windows.
[01:27:43.540 --> 01:27:47.540]   You can download, install, and then it really is slick.
[01:27:47.540 --> 01:27:50.260]   It sees very much like iTunes does.
[01:27:50.260 --> 01:27:53.340]   It sees what's on your droid phone,
[01:27:53.340 --> 01:27:55.460]   and you can sync that up to it,
[01:27:55.460 --> 01:27:58.540]   but it also sees what's in your iTunes library.
[01:27:58.540 --> 01:28:03.500]   It has an Amazon MP3 music store, so you can buy stuff.
[01:28:03.500 --> 01:28:05.040]   You can add feeds.
[01:28:05.040 --> 01:28:08.300]   It's pretty sophisticated and a great way
[01:28:08.300 --> 01:28:11.940]   to get photos, movies,
[01:28:11.940 --> 01:28:15.500]   and music onto your droid platform.
[01:28:15.500 --> 01:28:19.180]   Absolutely free, DoubleTwist.com.
[01:28:19.180 --> 01:28:22.420]   And I think this is a really great solution
[01:28:22.420 --> 01:28:25.540]   for people who are saying, well, you know,
[01:28:25.540 --> 01:28:27.660]   Nexus one or droid, it's a great platform,
[01:28:27.660 --> 01:28:29.660]   but it's not an MP3, it's not a music player.
[01:28:29.660 --> 01:28:31.420]   I think this really puts it back into--
[01:28:31.420 --> 01:28:33.140]   - So you just obviously install everything
[01:28:33.140 --> 01:28:34.900]   straight onto the memory card.
[01:28:34.900 --> 01:28:36.260]   - It does it automatically, yeah.
[01:28:36.260 --> 01:28:38.620]   In fact, I would suggest upgrading your SD card.
[01:28:38.620 --> 01:28:40.420]   It comes with a four gig card in the Nexus one,
[01:28:40.420 --> 01:28:43.140]   but you can get a 16 gig card for under 100 bucks,
[01:28:43.140 --> 01:28:44.180]   and I think it's a nice--
[01:28:44.180 --> 01:28:45.700]   If you're gonna put a lot of stuff on there.
[01:28:45.700 --> 01:28:47.260]   The only thing missing to me at this point
[01:28:47.260 --> 01:28:48.420]   is if I get audible on here,
[01:28:48.420 --> 01:28:51.420]   I'd be done with the iPhone.
[01:28:51.420 --> 01:28:52.260]   I really would.
[01:28:52.260 --> 01:28:55.980]   So there's my tip, DoubleTwist.com.
[01:28:55.980 --> 01:28:57.140]   That's nice too. - That's what I'm using.
[01:28:57.140 --> 01:28:58.700]   Yeah. - Oh, you know it already.
[01:28:58.700 --> 01:29:00.260]   - Yeah, DoubleTwist is actually,
[01:29:00.260 --> 01:29:03.660]   it's uncanny, uncanny, looks very similar to iTunes,
[01:29:03.660 --> 01:29:04.780]   and we know with album art,
[01:29:04.780 --> 01:29:06.020]   and the good ones to sync. - It's really great.
[01:29:06.020 --> 01:29:08.220]   - It's pretty great, yeah, and that is what I'm using, so.
[01:29:08.220 --> 01:29:13.220]   There's another one from Saling for the folks who use a Mac.
[01:29:13.220 --> 01:29:14.580]   They're, the,
[01:29:14.580 --> 01:29:16.340]   S-A-L-L-I-N-G.com,
[01:29:16.340 --> 01:29:18.140]   Saling Software has a sync program.
[01:29:18.140 --> 01:29:19.300]   It's very similar, but it's not free,
[01:29:19.300 --> 01:29:20.620]   so why not use DoubleTwist?
[01:29:20.620 --> 01:29:22.900]   - Siva, so great to have you on.
[01:29:22.900 --> 01:29:25.060]   Thank you so much for adding your perspective to this,
[01:29:25.060 --> 01:29:28.100]   which one of the biggest news days since this show launched,
[01:29:28.100 --> 01:29:30.780]   and frankly, every week's been huge.
[01:29:30.780 --> 01:29:33.260]   Google's been so busy since we launched this show.
[01:29:33.260 --> 01:29:37.100]   Siva's blog is called The Googleization of Everything.
[01:29:37.100 --> 01:29:40.860]   It's a place to go to read about Google and--
[01:29:40.860 --> 01:29:43.260]   - When is the book coming out, Siva?
[01:29:43.260 --> 01:29:45.580]   - We don't have a pub date yet, but it's probably fall.
[01:29:45.580 --> 01:29:49.300]   It's days, weeks like this have slowed it down.
[01:29:49.300 --> 01:29:50.980]   - Yeah, no kidding, it's because before.
[01:29:50.980 --> 01:29:53.900]   I bet you would love Google to stop doing stuff.
[01:29:53.900 --> 01:29:56.020]   - I thought I had a totally solid China chapter,
[01:29:56.020 --> 01:29:58.060]   and now I had to break right back into it.
[01:29:58.060 --> 01:29:59.620]   - They are a moving target.
[01:29:59.620 --> 01:30:00.460]   - They really are.
[01:30:00.460 --> 01:30:02.460]   - No, no, no, no, no folks without general motor.
[01:30:02.460 --> 01:30:04.220]   - Something that doesn't change that fast, right?
[01:30:04.220 --> 01:30:05.100]   - Yeah, there you go.
[01:30:05.100 --> 01:30:07.460]   - Yeah, newspapers.
[01:30:07.460 --> 01:30:09.420]   - No, no, that's not a bad one right now.
[01:30:09.420 --> 01:30:11.900]   Jeff Jarvis covers the media.
[01:30:11.900 --> 01:30:13.700]   Go ahead, I'm sorry, Siva.
[01:30:13.700 --> 01:30:15.300]   - Our next book is actually about newspapers.
[01:30:15.300 --> 01:30:16.140]   We'll talk about that some other time.
[01:30:16.140 --> 01:30:17.700]   - Oh, Siva, we gotta talk.
[01:30:17.700 --> 01:30:20.460]   - Oh, that's Jeff Jarvis's being--
[01:30:20.460 --> 01:30:21.340]   - We're up and it'll be dead.
[01:30:21.340 --> 01:30:24.260]   - He's covering the end of journalism as we know it.
[01:30:24.260 --> 01:30:25.500]   He also teaches this--
[01:30:25.500 --> 01:30:26.860]   - Or calls it in, someone's sorry.
[01:30:26.860 --> 01:30:28.300]   - Some would say causing it.
[01:30:28.300 --> 01:30:30.620]   At Cooney at the City University of New York
[01:30:30.620 --> 01:30:32.340]   in the graduate program journalism there,
[01:30:32.340 --> 01:30:34.460]   and he also is the author of the Buzz Machine blog
[01:30:34.460 --> 01:30:37.220]   in the book, "What Would Google Do Available Everywhere
[01:30:37.220 --> 01:30:39.100]   Including Audible.com?"
[01:30:39.100 --> 01:30:42.380]   And Gina Trapani is still working on the complete guide
[01:30:42.380 --> 01:30:45.300]   to Google Wave, completewaveguide.com.
[01:30:45.300 --> 01:30:46.780]   Any day now.
[01:30:46.780 --> 01:30:48.500]   - Oh yeah, I'm working on the first edition.
[01:30:48.500 --> 01:30:51.420]   - Hey, is Wave, I mean, we don't hear much about Wave
[01:30:51.420 --> 01:30:53.460]   these days, is it being changed a lot?
[01:30:53.460 --> 01:30:56.060]   - It's definitely not getting the kind of press that it was,
[01:30:56.060 --> 01:30:58.780]   and the changes that are coming out are like small
[01:30:58.780 --> 01:31:00.780]   kind of, you know, dribs and jabs of this, that,
[01:31:00.780 --> 01:31:02.940]   and the other thing, there haven't been any major releases,
[01:31:02.940 --> 01:31:04.140]   but just little things here and there.
[01:31:04.140 --> 01:31:06.820]   This week they launched suggested contacts.
[01:31:06.820 --> 01:31:09.420]   You know, if you create a new wave and go to add someone,
[01:31:09.420 --> 01:31:12.860]   it algorithmically recommends the people who you wave
[01:31:12.860 --> 01:31:14.940]   with the most, which is nice.
[01:31:14.940 --> 01:31:17.620]   They added the ability to kind of expand your image
[01:31:17.620 --> 01:31:18.940]   thumbnails inside of a wave.
[01:31:18.940 --> 01:31:20.820]   I mean, they're adding little things here and there.
[01:31:20.820 --> 01:31:23.580]   I'm kind of, I don't know, I lay awake at night
[01:31:23.580 --> 01:31:26.100]   and hope that there's gonna be like a major wave release
[01:31:26.100 --> 01:31:28.180]   that integrates with Gmail and like,
[01:31:28.180 --> 01:31:30.140]   makes the product do all the things that like,
[01:31:30.140 --> 01:31:32.180]   I feel like it can do and just isn't there yet,
[01:31:32.180 --> 01:31:33.180]   but it hasn't happened yet.
[01:31:33.180 --> 01:31:34.020]   Some days.
[01:31:34.020 --> 01:31:35.500]   - So we'll see, hopefully it won't happen before it,
[01:31:35.500 --> 01:31:37.540]   or it will happen before it, but out the first edition,
[01:31:37.540 --> 01:31:40.420]   because I might want my book to be obsolete
[01:31:40.420 --> 01:31:41.500]   in the first month.
[01:31:41.500 --> 01:31:44.700]   - The preview PDF is now available at completewaveguide.com
[01:31:44.700 --> 01:31:47.860]   for $6 as Gina says, the price of a sandwich.
[01:31:47.860 --> 01:31:51.940]   Better than a sandwich and more nutritional and sustaining.
[01:31:51.940 --> 01:31:54.820]   But Gina, I do wanna concur with Jeff.
[01:31:54.820 --> 01:31:57.180]   When is your Android book coming out?
[01:31:57.180 --> 01:31:58.260]   That's the one.
[01:31:58.260 --> 01:31:59.740]   That's the one. - Oh man.
[01:31:59.740 --> 01:32:00.700]   - It's begging for it.
[01:32:00.700 --> 01:32:03.260]   It's begging, the problem is, Andrew is in moving target.
[01:32:03.260 --> 01:32:04.100]   It really is.
[01:32:04.100 --> 01:32:05.540]   I'd hate to kind of try to pin it.
[01:32:05.540 --> 01:32:06.900]   - We asked for a question Twitter
[01:32:06.900 --> 01:32:09.140]   to keep going with this topic of,
[01:32:09.140 --> 01:32:11.660]   Gina explains the Android to Jeff in the world.
[01:32:11.660 --> 01:32:15.060]   - You know, I think maybe next week, if nothing happens.
[01:32:15.060 --> 01:32:16.220]   - Sure.
[01:32:16.220 --> 01:32:18.340]   - If Google would just take a week off.
[01:32:18.340 --> 01:32:21.540]   - Jeff, keep using the phone.
[01:32:21.540 --> 01:32:22.900]   Like, take the phone with you this week.
[01:32:22.900 --> 01:32:25.020]   And then, and jot down questions.
[01:32:25.020 --> 01:32:26.860]   You know, let's give more questions, let's do it.
[01:32:26.860 --> 01:32:27.900]   - More questions, yeah.
[01:32:27.900 --> 01:32:29.420]   - Yeah, yeah, I'd be happy to,
[01:32:29.420 --> 01:32:31.140]   I love talking about that stuff.
[01:32:31.140 --> 01:32:32.660]   - You know, I wake up in the middle of the night.
[01:32:32.660 --> 01:32:34.340]   I play with the phone for three hours.
[01:32:34.340 --> 01:32:35.500]   It's my new girlfriend.
[01:32:35.500 --> 01:32:38.340]   I know it's sad, but it's true.
[01:32:38.340 --> 01:32:39.300]   I love this thing.
[01:32:39.300 --> 01:32:40.580]   I mean, it's just-- - I was gonna make a crack
[01:32:40.580 --> 01:32:42.380]   about all the porn apps in the Android market,
[01:32:42.380 --> 01:32:44.540]   but I'm gonna-- - I know nothing about that.
[01:32:44.540 --> 01:32:45.940]   That's not what I'm playing with.
[01:32:45.940 --> 01:32:47.500]   No, I don't, I'm not looking at that.
[01:32:47.500 --> 01:32:49.380]   I'm just loving this thing.
[01:32:49.380 --> 01:32:52.340]   - If you search for Mint in the Android market,
[01:32:52.340 --> 01:32:54.620]   some enterprising developer,
[01:32:54.620 --> 01:32:56.580]   realize that everyone in the world wants a Mint app.
[01:32:56.580 --> 01:32:57.580]   - That's all we want is Mint.
[01:32:57.580 --> 01:32:58.420]   - Mint.com.
[01:32:58.420 --> 01:33:01.420]   But it's actually you get daily Mint girls
[01:33:01.420 --> 01:33:02.860]   as a result, remember.
[01:33:02.860 --> 01:33:06.420]   So yeah, you know that-- - I got capitalism.
[01:33:06.420 --> 01:33:08.620]   - I'm breaking out the SDK. - Or because you're finances,
[01:33:08.620 --> 01:33:10.660]   or whatever. - Or whatever.
[01:33:10.660 --> 01:33:12.620]   - Get the stress. - Take that China.
[01:33:12.620 --> 01:33:15.260]   (laughing)
[01:33:15.260 --> 01:33:17.180]   - You wouldn't see that in the iTunes store.
[01:33:17.180 --> 01:33:19.220]   - Gina's blog is smarter where.org,
[01:33:19.220 --> 01:33:20.580]   a great place to go, some great effect.
[01:33:20.580 --> 01:33:22.380]   We didn't even talk about some of the really good articles
[01:33:22.380 --> 01:33:23.900]   this week you put up there.
[01:33:23.900 --> 01:33:25.660]   I actually had them bookmarked,
[01:33:25.660 --> 01:33:26.980]   and we didn't get around to them.
[01:33:26.980 --> 01:33:28.460]   How to tether your Android phone,
[01:33:28.460 --> 01:33:30.900]   I thought that was gonna be your tip.
[01:33:30.900 --> 01:33:31.900]   You do have to root it though.
[01:33:31.900 --> 01:33:33.380]   - That's the next big thing. - Do you have to root it?
[01:33:33.380 --> 01:33:36.300]   - You don't have to, there are three ways to do it.
[01:33:36.300 --> 01:33:40.620]   One is by rooting, another is by sort of being a cisab man.
[01:33:40.620 --> 01:33:43.180]   The third is cost $30, but it's super simple.
[01:33:43.180 --> 01:33:44.100]   - Oh, okay.
[01:33:44.100 --> 01:33:45.660]   - PDA net.
[01:33:45.660 --> 01:33:46.900]   - That's what I'm doing. - She just works with me on,
[01:33:46.900 --> 01:33:50.540]   it worked beautifully for me on my old trio,
[01:33:50.540 --> 01:33:51.660]   may I rest in peace.
[01:33:51.660 --> 01:33:53.060]   - All right, PDA net.
[01:33:53.060 --> 01:33:54.220]   - Yeah, it worked great on Android.
[01:33:54.220 --> 01:33:55.500]   I mean, it's 30 bucks, and in fact,
[01:33:55.500 --> 01:33:58.380]   you can use it for free, but you just can't access any HTTPS
[01:33:58.380 --> 01:34:00.260]   and any encrypted connections.
[01:34:00.260 --> 01:34:02.660]   But yeah, pay 30 bucks, install the software on your computer,
[01:34:02.660 --> 01:34:04.180]   and you put the app on your Android phone,
[01:34:04.180 --> 01:34:05.220]   and you can get online from anywhere.
[01:34:05.220 --> 01:34:07.020]   And actually, I sent my blog post,
[01:34:07.020 --> 01:34:07.900]   I think I'm getting old,
[01:34:07.900 --> 01:34:10.540]   because I decided to go that route instead of rooting it.
[01:34:10.540 --> 01:34:11.940]   - Yep, yep. - Either given China,
[01:34:11.940 --> 01:34:13.500]   I think everything will be HTTPS.
[01:34:13.500 --> 01:34:14.340]   (laughing)
[01:34:14.340 --> 01:34:15.260]   - Yeah, you better.
[01:34:15.260 --> 01:34:17.020]   - So you can't use Gmail if you--
[01:34:17.020 --> 01:34:18.060]   - That's very clever though,
[01:34:18.060 --> 01:34:20.060]   that's a very clever way to do the freemium,
[01:34:20.060 --> 01:34:22.540]   which is you can see if it works,
[01:34:22.540 --> 01:34:24.020]   you just can't do Gmail.
[01:34:24.020 --> 01:34:25.940]   - Not that you need to, 'cause you got Gmail on there.
[01:34:25.940 --> 01:34:28.380]   That's cool. - Well, you'd have your Gmail cached
[01:34:28.380 --> 01:34:29.820]   in the Gmail app on Android,
[01:34:29.820 --> 01:34:31.700]   but I'm pretty sure that that app makes
[01:34:31.700 --> 01:34:34.060]   encrypted connections to Gmail, so it wouldn't sync.
[01:34:34.060 --> 01:34:34.900]   You know what I mean? - Right, right.
[01:34:34.900 --> 01:34:36.220]   - So if you were tethering, it wouldn't sync.
[01:34:36.220 --> 01:34:38.980]   But you could still use your Gmail offline
[01:34:38.980 --> 01:34:41.580]   using the Gmail app on Android, which is pretty cool.
[01:34:41.580 --> 01:34:43.420]   - How do you do Android screenshots?
[01:34:43.420 --> 01:34:45.100]   Are you just taking a picture?
[01:34:45.100 --> 01:34:46.260]   - Oh, it's the worst.
[01:34:46.260 --> 01:34:48.420]   There's no screenshot app, like, go ahead.
[01:34:48.420 --> 01:34:49.580]   - Oh, a week-- - This is the one thing,
[01:34:49.580 --> 01:34:50.580]   I mean, the iPhone.
[01:34:50.580 --> 01:34:52.060]   (laughing)
[01:34:52.060 --> 01:34:52.900]   I don't know, this is--
[01:34:52.900 --> 01:34:53.740]   - The iPhone is built in. - It's not gonna be
[01:34:53.740 --> 01:34:54.580]   something like me. - Yeah.
[01:34:54.580 --> 01:34:55.620]   - In the iPhone, you press the two buttons
[01:34:55.620 --> 01:34:56.460]   and you have a screenshot.
[01:34:56.460 --> 01:34:58.180]   With Android, it is like a process.
[01:34:58.180 --> 01:34:59.780]   You have to install the SDK,
[01:34:59.780 --> 01:35:01.940]   connect the phone to your computer,
[01:35:01.940 --> 01:35:03.540]   bring up this debugger thing,
[01:35:03.540 --> 01:35:05.020]   and then save screenshots from there.
[01:35:05.020 --> 01:35:05.940]   It is a rigmarole.
[01:35:05.940 --> 01:35:07.380]   And, you know, it's one of those things where,
[01:35:07.380 --> 01:35:10.660]   like, if Android developers want people to show off Android,
[01:35:10.660 --> 01:35:13.540]   there should be either way to take screenshots, you know?
[01:35:13.540 --> 01:35:14.380]   So yes.
[01:35:14.380 --> 01:35:15.220]   - I should, you should look.
[01:35:15.220 --> 01:35:16.820]   I bet there, if there's an API call
[01:35:16.820 --> 01:35:19.900]   to shoot the screen, that would be an easy app to write.
[01:35:19.900 --> 01:35:22.420]   - There are some apps, but you have to have root access.
[01:35:22.420 --> 01:35:23.260]   - There's a run.
[01:35:23.260 --> 01:35:25.900]   So there's some sort of hardware layer protection
[01:35:25.900 --> 01:35:28.540]   in the hardware that isn't letting Android take screenshot.
[01:35:28.540 --> 01:35:30.140]   It's weird, I don't understand why that would have to
[01:35:30.140 --> 01:35:30.980]   figure this out. - So that's what we
[01:35:30.980 --> 01:35:32.500]   want Android to be.
[01:35:32.500 --> 01:35:33.460]   (laughing)
[01:35:33.460 --> 01:35:35.180]   - We could do that.
[01:35:35.180 --> 01:35:38.300]   Really great blog, must read if you're into iPhone
[01:35:38.300 --> 01:35:40.140]   or anything, anything productivity-wise,
