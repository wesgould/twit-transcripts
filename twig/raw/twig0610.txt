[00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.180]   There's probably some Google in it, but I don't know god. Yeah, we all got we got all the
[00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:04.940]   But I but I also have probably competitors. So I feel like it's not gonna bias my I've done that too

[00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:20.060]   Did the clock set up yes dream this sound like somebody said we all got a little
[00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.700]   Google in us we all got a little Google in us
[00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:30.580]   Yes, we do you know that you know that how you be sir. I am well. How are you somebody was telling me always
[00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:35.260]   Mary Joe Foley earlier on Windows weekly. Well, it seems like hours ago now
[00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:42.380]   Was because I don't know if you've seen her
[00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:49.540]   Picture on the petri site, but you apparently you took it and she loves it. Oh, yeah, and she said and is so good
[00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:54.740]   he you know he he's kind of subtle and he sneaks around and
[00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:56.940]   and
[00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.920]   So it's good. It's really good. It's a good photographer should yeah, here's the
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.860]   MJ Foley chat. Let's see if I could
[00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:12.840]   Find the picture it's on her um Twitter profile - is it oh nice oh nice
[00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:18.360]   Yeah, I was I was so honored when she yeah changed it. Yeah, it's beautiful. I
[00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:23.420]   Actually wasn't sure so I said have you paid him for that here? It is
[00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:29.700]   She said it was great because she just captured me. This was when she was in our studio. She gets me a beautifully
[00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:39.100]   US RP I believe was the camera that I use did you give a turn quote unquote lower end?
[00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.780]   Yes, there's no lower
[00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:46.700]   You shoot it in black and white or did she did they do it later that way?
[00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:52.920]   She did it later because I sent it to her in color nice. It's all sure that Twitter profile. It's in color. Oh nice
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:59.580]   Anyway, that's a great. Thank you for hands-on photography is a show where you could catch all his his tips
[00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:04.900]   Also, we welcome normally Stacy Higumoth would be here. She has the day off
[00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:10.140]   So we thought we'd bring in our producer Jason Howell also the host of all about Android and
[00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:13.920]   Man about town tech news weekly. It's great to have you. Thank you Jason
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:17.400]   So we thank you produce a lot of you get your sushi. He's good
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:22.240]   He just does everything everything do everything at this point everything. Yes, we've kind of pay the bills
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:25.720]   We kind of stripped down to just a handful of people so
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:30.500]   We all do more than we used to that's all I could say except for me. I don't do anything. I
[00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:36.540]   Just hang out. I want to ask a question real quick before we jump in. Yes
[00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:40.440]   What what is the genesis behind singing Craig Newmark?
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:47.500]   Jeff do you want to explain that? I'm not I'm not even sure I remember. I think it was just that was the important part
[00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:55.200]   Yeah, you told us joke with a you told us the Craig Newmark the the founder of Craig's list and still owner
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:59.680]   I mean, there's only about eight people work there amazing philanthropist. He's done them very well
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.680]   So he's got lots of money to give away
[00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:03.760]   endowed
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:08.040]   The Graduate School of Journalism. So it's now called the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:10.840]   And I think that's a cUNY and I think the joke was
[00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:17.840]   That he really liked it to us to emphasize Craig Newmark and so it started Craig Newmark and it got more and more
[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:21.600]   Eventually we started singing it. That's that's the origin of it. I guess
[00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:25.160]   We need to rehearse three-part harmony. We have a well
[00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.160]   You can't do it very well in
[00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.800]   difficult to do on zoom with latency
[00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:34.160]   So what I've done is I've paused and I wait till they start singing and then I sing
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.560]   That's the way we could do Craig Craig
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:39.160]   Newmark
[00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.640]   But then we would sound like the three stooches
[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:46.040]   Well, well, it's fitting kind of are
[00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:54.000]   Did you see the I just love this New York Times article
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.040]   I've talked about it a couple of times I apologize if you watch all of our shows Google's plan for the future of work
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:04.360]   This is as people come back to the Google Plex where or Google campuses all over the world
[00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:11.160]   It was in the New York Times, but the best way to read it is on on more website online because they've created a bunch of
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:15.280]   animated gifts to demonstrate so this is the pod that
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:22.520]   They're creating see there's the you know somebody finally bought this Google big screen remember this they they promoted this
[00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:30.200]   You have one all right, yeah, and then they're doing avatars kind of like we do avatars in their meetings and stuff
[00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:32.600]   so the idea is
[00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:42.280]   Board it was a jam jam board. That's it. What is this white board? This is just a regular worth billions and you sit on uncomfortable plywood plywood
[00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:49.120]   Why would well, maybe be be be way though. These might be prototypes. I don't know
[00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.520]   So does that camera in the middle swing around? Oh?
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:54.560]   That's a good question. I was a 360 maybe
[00:07:54.560 --> 00:08:02.880]   That's the Google magic and I love how they made the the tube that hides the wires clear so it doesn't hide the wires
[00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:05.960]   It reminds me of something. Oh
[00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:09.560]   Yeah, I've just spent the last three hours watching
[00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:17.840]   Maybe you prefer this this is their campsites on the Mountain View campus because it's in Northern California weather
[00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:24.760]   It's exactly Jason is this is just exactly like out of Iowa. Isn't it they just read yeah? It really is very reminiscent actually you're right
[00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:27.440]   That's good stuff though the press area especially
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.760]   Adirondack chairs also, you know, you could make them you could paint them, but no it's Google
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:40.080]   So we're just gonna leave them raw wood the way it is these are they took over some of the parking lots and turned them into little
[00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:42.080]   This is a camp Charleston
[00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:48.840]   They're gonna do this in London Los Angeles Munich New York and Sydney as well each camp theme name
[00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:56.280]   Each each meeting room has a camp themed name like so I'm saying is there is there a person whose job it is to name things there
[00:08:56.560 --> 00:09:04.800]   I'm the master neighbor. I have met they have some very good facilities people and there are people there who are designers
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:12.960]   Basically and that's the whole that's that's clearly who did this is designers kindling is one of them smores is another
[00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:18.560]   canoe is another look here's somebody waiting to do something in canoe
[00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:26.440]   Yeah, it looks kind of lonely you're close to my favorite part though if you scroll down a couple more pictures
[00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:28.440]   I know I've been saving the best for last
[00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:34.960]   Right here's here's the woman who does this by the way Michelle. Oh, here's the prize as you oh this is good
[00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:41.280]   You want this chair? This is the chair right into the tube that blows cold air, but you can control it
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:46.000]   Yeah, it's to keep you safe. Yes, but what if you're follically challenged?
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:51.360]   Yeah, I don't I don't you can control her. You know, it may turn it down. It's possible. That's not blows
[00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:56.680]   I don't know. We're just assuming right it could be zips into the lines, which is fascinating to yeah
[00:09:56.680 --> 00:10:02.640]   You go to your car at the end of it. It's it's it's in so you can move around. There's a little zippers exactly Wow
[00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:09.200]   Wow very flexible and then this is the one you were talking about Jason now actually we should start at the beginning
[00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:14.160]   Yeah, it's an animal. I don't know how you triggered from the beginning because it's very anti climactic when it first
[00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:19.360]   Yeah, so close your eyes folks. So here's the deal. You're in your office and you want privacy
[00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:26.080]   So you I don't know the button or what you send an email and a pro privacy robot comes robot
[00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:30.160]   In fact at the beginning of this video, which is coming up here. You'll see it and then it expands
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:32.720]   It looks like it's got sticky jelly
[00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:36.080]   It it really looks like it looks like the
[00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:42.480]   Fissioning potty spotty snatchers is what it looks like. It's a rainbow-y cellophane now. Maybe by the way
[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:45.360]   I should point out these people are moving faster than real time
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:48.000]   So this thing is just taking a long
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.360]   Slower than setting up a nixie clock. It's infinitely
[00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:53.920]   slow
[00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:58.160]   But does it's all the time and then it inflates and you're gonna have privacy
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:05.200]   I think actually they call it the nookie wall. I don't know why I could have gone and grabbed a C stand in a backdrop
[00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:11.360]   I know this is so or just hey, how about I got this. I got an idea. How about pulling a curtain across like in the hospital
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:14.080]   That yeah, this would make me
[00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:15.840]   But that would be googly enough though, right?
[00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:16.880]   Yeah, yeah
[00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:23.600]   Those options require a person to do the work and this is meant to eliminate that person as uh, you know, all jobs are going away
[00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:26.560]   I love the new old breed would it be? Yes
[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:30.960]   So I'm sitting there next to to Jason and then Jason suddenly just decides
[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:34.800]   Jarvis can't hear this. I'm calling the wall robot
[00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:38.800]   Lower the privacy dome
[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:40.960]   Wall balloon
[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:43.360]   Wall balloon come silence. Yeah, she's
[00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:46.320]   Anyway, google is getting ready for the future. Oh, this is a good one
[00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:52.160]   You go in and you swipe your your key card on here. See on the left. There's a little pad
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:58.960]   She swipes it and and and the and everything adjusts to her so the tables rising. Oh, yeah
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:04.560]   Yeah, it knows your settings kind of like your car might if I was gonna say cars do that now, right? Yeah, yeah
[00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:10.320]   Again, google's really got to work on their cable food though. This is just not acceptable. What is that going on there?
[00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:12.480]   Rare would really mark them terrible look
[00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:18.960]   Look even if I've seen with with like uh, Alex Lindsey's crew and office hours
[00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:21.200]   That's that's amazing cable man. I know
[00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:28.800]   I'm gonna be on office hours tomorrow by the way. I know I was told agenda. I was told that the uh
[00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:31.760]   Mike call is 640 a.m. My time
[00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:39.120]   Yes, sir. Hmm. They're they're actually on they're actually online before dad. Oh, usually they're only about about six
[00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:42.400]   She's um doing your PJ's Leo. Yeah
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:46.560]   Notice by the way that the the google max hub
[00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:50.800]   Changes to have her content and her pictures watch turn to her dog
[00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:53.360]   Which is awesome is really kind of neat. Yeah
[00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:57.840]   And when she goes away, it changes back again. So I you know, I wouldn't mind that
[00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:04.480]   So soon forgotten. Yeah. Yeah. This is the new campus. They're building in mountain view. It's uh, that's the garden
[00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:07.600]   Can't we've talked about this years ago. That's what it looks like. I remember seeing that
[00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:12.640]   Still on the construction still yeah, I feel like every year we go to google.io
[00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:15.760]   We see like the next phase of this and it just kind of looks the same
[00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:20.560]   It's like a couple of more bubbles hanging up in the sky, but that's about it
[00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:23.440]   One of these days. Here's a team
[00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:27.920]   Still be a construction check everything in the team pot is on casters. So it's completely
[00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:33.760]   Moveable. They you know, this must be silicon valley chic all these open wires and and stuff
[00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:37.600]   Because remember in the facebook headquarters mark said don't finish anything
[00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:41.520]   Just you know like paint dribbling down the wall don't finish at all. It just just that's the shtick
[00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:43.280]   That's the shtick. Yeah
[00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:46.400]   Makes it. It's you know what they they have to do this make it feel messy though
[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:50.880]   Yeah, but this is young people right now. This is for young people. They want you to feel like you're in a dorm room
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:53.840]   And boy, I'm sure it looks like what you're in
[00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:57.040]   That's a good perspective. I never thought about it that way
[00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:00.080]   Younger people because they always people
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:01.600]   uh
[00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:03.600]   35 and up bar
[00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:07.360]   are signing up to work at google these days they always said um
[00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:15.120]   At microsoft back in the day that they they call it a campus and they give it a campus like environment google always has with food
[00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:17.360]   your cleaning is done
[00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:19.040]   uh because
[00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:24.160]   You know dry cleaning like you can drop off your dry cleaning as you write because they want to attract kids out of school
[00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:29.520]   And they want them to feel at home because yeah, obviously they're young people now everything you just saw as somebody is scooter x's point
[00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:34.640]   And that's just a demo but I have a feeling the demo is gonna if the final product's not gonna be anymore
[00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:40.720]   Nice in fact, I would wire the demo better than the final product probably but you're not gonna get any that stuff a base camp
[00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:43.040]   Oh no more
[00:14:43.040 --> 00:14:45.840]   Hey, what happened at base camp 20 people left
[00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:52.480]   We talked about this last week. I thought it was a little gossipy to be honest casey newton blew the lid off of
[00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:55.760]   Base camp just to recap if you didn't hear last week's show
[00:14:55.760 --> 00:15:02.480]   Uh, it started because they found out that somebody had been keeping a list of quote funny customer names
[00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:05.760]   Since the beginning of 20 37 signals
[00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:10.480]   Um apparently nobody wants to say what the names were because they were so racist and insulting
[00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:12.160]   uh that
[00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:18.240]   Prompted kind of a call to Jesus. They there was a lot of discussion on the company's base camp is uh, you know a
[00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:20.080]   Co-working
[00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:24.640]   Pit of software so you have chats in there and stuff and that got very heated apparently
[00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:30.000]   The guy in charge of product have been with base camp since almost the beginning since when it was 37 signals
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.560]   Uh was conservative
[00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:38.560]   And would put links from bright bard in there and stuff and I think that that actually is what happened that might have been a trigger
[00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:42.320]   uh because yeah, if you read casey's latest
[00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:44.640]   he uh
[00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:47.840]   Was saying things like there's no white supremacy in the united states and then
[00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:50.560]   Uh a black team member who nobody
[00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:56.400]   Everybody's declined to name said well, that's not true obviously
[00:15:56.400 --> 00:15:59.680]   and they gotten a bit of a fight and uh
[00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:05.760]   Anyway, they had an all hands meeting last friday. This is after we were talking about it last week
[00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:09.040]   Uh in which it just got completely out of hand
[00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:11.120]   and
[00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:15.040]   Jason freed the ceo said look if you guys want buyouts will buy you out and
[00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:19.600]   20 people took it including that designer far that's so far amount
[00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:22.400]   Wow
[00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:24.400]   That's still pretty gossipy
[00:16:24.400 --> 00:16:28.240]   But I think it's not it's it's relevant to kind of
[00:16:28.240 --> 00:16:31.760]   you know
[00:16:31.760 --> 00:16:34.400]   Work workplace morays versus
[00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:39.840]   Public morays and this actually relates to the google thing because young people I think expect
[00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:43.440]   Just because they this is how it was in the dorms and in college
[00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:47.680]   To that these discussions should be held in the open if they're acrimonious or acrimonious
[00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:52.080]   And us old types think oh that shouldn't happen at work
[00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:55.200]   And I think there's a little bit of a
[00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:59.600]   Collision there that's my that's well, it's the funny thing about this because this is
[00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:02.160]   You know, these are the young farts
[00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:04.320]   who are in charge who decreed this and
[00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:10.880]   Jason freed and david henamier hanson are no longer young farts. Well, but there are you younger than I am and you are
[00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:13.040]   Well, almost everybody is
[00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:15.440]   And you had a third of the companies
[00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:17.680]   To work 47
[00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:19.840]   So depending on your depending on which end of the
[00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:23.200]   Telescope you're looking at that's either young or old depending on
[00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:25.840]   Which ended the um oh dish
[00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:32.480]   So the all hands meeting led to a third of the company quitting. It's not that big a company
[00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:38.560]   So you think it's the youngs that are doing this. I think Jason is considered by the staff
[00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:41.680]   Older as his boss. He's the boss
[00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:44.880]   But but you have that that denial stage
[00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:51.600]   In this stuff. No, no, no, we're okay. I'm not like that. Let me tell you how I'm okay. Oh, it's a problem. Okay. I'll fix it
[00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:56.320]   Um, you know, and that's why I've been I live that most of my life there, right?
[00:17:56.320 --> 00:18:01.840]   I'm you know, you learn these things. Yeah, and so the idea that a company could be not political
[00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:04.480]   Is like saying technology is neutral
[00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:11.360]   It's political. Yeah, it's political but at the same time you don't want these kind of bitter fights to
[00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:15.360]   Go on in a company chat where productivity is supposed to be happening
[00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:20.640]   Right, we agree with that last week. Right. Yeah, you want to have a but you but you don't want to just tamp it down and say don't have it
[00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:25.440]   It doesn't exist that ain't gonna help. Well, I think that's what they were trying to do. That's what they did initially
[00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:27.840]   Yeah, they were gonna bring in a facilitator. They said
[00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:30.320]   um
[00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:33.520]   But it just went all and went all the hell yeah
[00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:35.600]   um
[00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:37.600]   Singer who um
[00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:41.360]   Was the guy who said let me give you his exact quote. I strongly disagree
[00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:48.400]   We live in a white supremacist culture. I don't believe in a lot of framing around implicit bias. I think a lot of that is actually racist
[00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:50.880]   um
[00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:55.840]   And this and so he said and you know, I've heard this. This is very much like the james damor
[00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:59.600]   Memo that circulated at google and got damor fired at google
[00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:03.360]   Very often if you express it a sending view you get called a nazi
[00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:08.480]   I've not felt this is open territory for discussion if we were to try to get into it as a group discussion
[00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:11.200]   It would be very painful and divisive
[00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:14.400]   uh, and then
[00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:18.240]   Jason free the ceo responded to that message with thank you ryan
[00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:20.720]   which
[00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:22.720]   Got some people upset
[00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:28.160]   One employee the black employee that shall remain nameless said the fact that you can be a white male
[00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:30.960]   And come to this meeting a call people racist
[00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:36.640]   And say white supremacy doesn't exist when it's blatant at this company is white privilege
[00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:40.160]   The fact he wasn't corrected and was in fact thanked
[00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:43.040]   It makes me sick
[00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:48.720]   This is a this is a culture. This is a company culture that is that is rapidly dissolving. This is not good
[00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:53.600]   And but but the thing is this is a company that says we we can we can we can tell all companies how to work
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.840]   Yeah, so there's some shot and Freud here and I think that's one of the exactly big story as people going
[00:19:57.840 --> 00:19:59.520]   Yes, see
[00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:01.520]   They're not as easy as it is
[00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:03.520]   exactly
[00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:12.400]   Well, and I wonder how much of this actually did exist but was very unspoken prior to all of this right like it really seems like the
[00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:16.400]   It's hitting the fan at this point around this particular
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:19.120]   This particular situation
[00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:23.680]   But I but I would have a hard time believing that there weren't at least some sort of indicators
[00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:26.320]   Prior to this that the people that are leaving
[00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:28.640]   weren't unsatisfied in some way
[00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:34.080]   Related to this in different ways that weren't quite as public and this was just like the tipping point to be like
[00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:38.720]   Yeah, all right. Yeah, either the ethics here or the the ethical boundaries have been crossed
[00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:43.040]   I no longer identify with this work environment. I'm out of here. Yeah, I can understand that
[00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:48.000]   You know, I have to say they've been a full disclosure. They've been a sponsor. I've interviewed both david and jason
[00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:54.080]   The founders and I think I used to think a lot of 37 signals. I think basecamp is great software
[00:20:54.080 --> 00:20:59.760]   but clearly it's running a company in these days is just as hard as any other kind of
[00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:06.240]   Social environment that we live in it's it's become so polarized and so angry that it's difficult
[00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:10.400]   So I think that's what you say right what else can you say by the way google
[00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:13.760]   Says it's saving a billion dollars a year
[00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:17.200]   By not taking people come back to the office
[00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:20.000]   Um, yeah
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:26.880]   They civil yeah, I say the travel budget with people going from the midwest or or texas or whatever
[00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:30.800]   Over here to the pacific coast that adds up. That's all around the world
[00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:35.520]   And I didn't notice this in their annual report. We talked about their quarterly results last week
[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:43.120]   But then their annual report they said advertising and promotional expenses dropped by 1.4 billion dollars in 2020
[00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:48.560]   Now here's the thing i'm glad jason's here because this is going to be very interesting
[00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:50.560]   sooner or perch i
[00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:52.800]   in the quarterly analyst call
[00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:58.000]   Said uh, we're ready this to kick back into gear right jason
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:02.800]   Well, yeah, he announced he announced some sort of significant
[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:09.680]   I don't know if it's product announcements or whatever, but he used the term significant announcements for google io
[00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:13.280]   And yeah, we were talking about this on all about andrade last night
[00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:18.880]   Just trying to figure out ok does that mean the usual like oh yeah andry 12 is pretty significant
[00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:23.440]   You know just as one example or does that mean this is one of those ios where they actually have
[00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:29.840]   Some hardware that they consider to be a big deal or maybe it's a deeper integration of assistant
[00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:32.560]   With smart home like what exactly does significant?
[00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:37.120]   Significant mean in light of what we've come to expect from my own the last couple of years
[00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:39.040]   So i'm pretty curious
[00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:46.560]   Normally saw it as market and speak because he he could have said pretty much the same thing about project treble and everything else
[00:22:46.560 --> 00:22:50.400]   Right totally. So yeah, it could be light. It could not be you know
[00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:56.960]   To him everything significant that google does but i i feel like when you come out in an earnings call and you say that specifically
[00:22:56.960 --> 00:23:01.200]   Hopefully you're backing it up so that you don't get on the other side of this and it's like well
[00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:04.720]   It's that's significant, but you know they change the colors on androids and that's about all i saw
[00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:09.680]   You know or it could be iowhere where it's stuff that they promised but two years later because i remember that
[00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:12.400]   Whatever happened to that
[00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:19.600]   Some people took it to mean well first of all I took it to be an admission that google had slept through 2020
[00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:26.400]   Understandably, but they really did was they didn't do much in 2020 and that he was in effect saying
[00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:31.840]   Hey, we slept through 2020, but we are waking up and get ready because google ios gonna have some great stuff
[00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:36.160]   And a number of people have taken that to mean that it might in fact be the pixel six
[00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:40.720]   Early right when does that come out Jason that would come out in october normally?
[00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:47.680]   Usually that would come out in october right and then we're also expecting the pixel five a five g which you know
[00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:50.240]   Five a would not be that exciting
[00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:52.560]   No, that wouldn't be exciting, but it would be a
[00:23:52.560 --> 00:23:57.680]   Mirror to the normal time of release based on previous devices of the similar
[00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:04.080]   Family so yeah, i'd be really surprised actually if they released the pixel six or at least you know
[00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:10.160]   But what google does is it's not necessarily that they release it. I could totally see them you're right google iow happens
[00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:16.400]   Here's the pixel six. We're beating all of the leaks. Here's everything you need to know about it and it comes out in three months
[00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:18.720]   You know well
[00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:22.880]   What about a watch mr. Howl that's
[00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:31.280]   Excited about that. Well, I mean well, I tell you I was I was excited about the one plus watch in that price point that it had and
[00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:36.160]   It totally bombed according to mr. Howl and everyone else they got their hands on it
[00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:41.920]   Um, he wants to see a watch and I would like to see what they offer up as mr
[00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:45.040]   Jarvis mentions there is they um pixel book
[00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:47.760]   Here's what I think
[00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:51.680]   I think first of all we know the pixel six is going to have google design chips
[00:24:52.800 --> 00:24:58.000]   Already okay already big deal right things they can do with that the one made yeah
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.480]   Right. I think that they did coast last year and that gave them time
[00:25:02.480 --> 00:25:06.800]   To you know in a in in sports they call it a rebuilding year
[00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:10.000]   Yep, and I think last year was the rebuilding year for google
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:13.680]   And they gave them the time to really rethink what they want to do with the pixel
[00:25:13.680 --> 00:25:17.200]   It's the strategy has been all over the map. It first came out. It was a low cost
[00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:20.960]   Developer phone then it got to be a flagship phone
[00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:26.640]   Then last year was a hohum flagship phone. They didn't update the camera. They didn't do anything
[00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:30.720]   I here's my guest this they're going to announce and ship
[00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:33.840]   A pixel six with all new google silicon
[00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:39.680]   In at google I owe in a week. Oh, it's gonna do local I AI
[00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:43.120]   Stop it's gonna be I'll do all that it's gonna have a much
[00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:45.520]   Better camera
[00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:49.440]   You know, they're still the pixel five didn't have anything different than the pixel four
[00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:53.600]   Correct. They're gonna have a much better camera. I think there's gonna be I think
[00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:58.720]   The way put chai said that to me sounded like
[00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:06.720]   Stand back. It's the same thing when apple said spring loaded is gonna be our venom and it was loaded had more stuff than they may delivered
[00:26:06.720 --> 00:26:12.400]   I feel like google and they need I also feel like they need to do this. They need it. Yep. They need a
[00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:18.320]   Whip crack wake-up call. We're back to work. We took this year. We did a rebuilding year
[00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:21.840]   You won't believe what we've been doing. So yeah, maybe you watch
[00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:28.000]   Forget about harvard for a second at a strategic level because he won't say where AI where AI where AI
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:29.760]   um
[00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:31.760]   What could they do?
[00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:34.080]   From a larger product perspective that would be wally
[00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:41.920]   If it's a AI AI AI first start by keeping some of your best staff on that team. Yeah, they're
[00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:48.480]   So they fired of course two people from their nai ethics commission and as a result
[00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:55.280]   uh one of their best people left he's uh now going to apple apple, right?
[00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:59.200]   Um, yeah, so what can you do with unethical AI?
[00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:05.760]   We're finding that out every single day. Jeff you can make a lot of news with that
[00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:07.840]   We're new frontiers
[00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:10.160]   Of evil ai man
[00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:15.520]   Here it is apple said on monday at hired former distinguished google scientist
[00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:17.520]   That's a very high level guy
[00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:22.640]   Sammy benjio who left the search giant amid turmoil in its ai research department
[00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:28.080]   He's expected to lead a new ai research unit at apple under another former googler
[00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:30.720]   john jian nuria
[00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:34.720]   Uh, he joined apple after spending about eight years in google a couple of years ago
[00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:38.080]   so apple's building this big ai team
[00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:45.520]   And googles, uh, this is this is the blowback from that really poorly handled ai ethics, uh,
[00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:51.920]   Fireings. Yeah, indeed. Don't get me wrong. I I root for google on this considering
[00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:54.080]   I'm in the google ecosystem
[00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:58.000]   So being able to have some ai that's going to make day-to-day life
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:05.040]   Better for me isn't my best interest, but they still got to get their crap together in their own house. You know what I mean?
[00:28:05.680 --> 00:28:11.280]   I agree always. Yeah, that's why I think it's so important that may 18th and by the way, we will be covering that
[00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:13.120]   That's a week from tuesday
[00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:17.920]   Uh, it will be doing jason and I will be doing the coverage of the keynote which just starts at 10 a.m
[00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:19.040]   Pacific
[00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:23.920]   Uh, 1 p.m. Eastern time and we'll be streaming that uh probably they say two hours right jason
[00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:29.440]   Yeah, yeah would be surprised if it was any less than that but yeah, probably about two hours
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:30.480]   Yeah
[00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:32.160]   Yeah, what you're saying about
[00:28:32.160 --> 00:28:35.920]   So circling back to the hardware, you know the potential of a pixel six
[00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:39.040]   Release at google.io. I would be
[00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:45.440]   Thrilled if that happened like I'd I'd feel like sundar pachai is delivering if if he made that happen
[00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:50.480]   If he truly showed that google spent the last year in like an introspective state and said
[00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:54.320]   What should we do to actually be taken seriously in the hardware game?
[00:28:54.320 --> 00:29:00.800]   Um, I think that would be great. What makes me believe that is not going to happen is google is horrible about keeping secrets
[00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:04.320]   And I feel like at this point this close to google.io if that was going to happen
[00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:09.440]   We'd have at least some semblance of information about the pixel six whatever it is
[00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:12.640]   I mean we know about the white chapel chip, but we don't really have a whole lot
[00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:17.760]   Of of uh the kinds of leaks that we're used to seeing leading up to a google release
[00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:23.120]   Which i'll you're after year show us google just does not know how to keep a lid on this stuff
[00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:27.920]   I feel like we'd see it by now, but maybe i'm wrong and i would love to be wrong because that would be
[00:29:28.000 --> 00:29:31.280]   That would mean that they're learning lessons and I want to see that from google
[00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:36.000]   Well, you know what maybe because they're not the same place. It's harder to leak
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:42.800]   Uh, well, yeah, that's a good point. Yeah, I still argue that they were leaking it themselves to the
[00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:46.640]   Of course, it's probably part of that too. Is it because you know what you're right? You're right
[00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:51.360]   The with google all the eddyroyd stuff wasn't that exciting anyway
[00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:53.920]   Nope, they might as well have leaked it
[00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:58.400]   Right. Well, I have a question for y'all with with this being a
[00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:02.960]   Google engineered piece of silicon that's going to be in place
[00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:05.520]   Do you think any of the masses care?
[00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:13.280]   Uh because even with apple doing the m1 and just how powerful it's been inside of its laptop so whatnot
[00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:20.240]   Uh people still seem to just worry more so about the cache of the iphone. Um, so so
[00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:27.520]   Do you think it is matters? Will will google's be able to take away some of the market share from the folks at sam's song
[00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:32.640]   With their new developments because I think all the people that are going to care are the nerds and geeks
[00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:36.640]   Yeah, so sam's on his promising room map
[00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:41.760]   I agree sam's on promises, you know, it's it's the the laptop that's like the phones
[00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:44.480]   So the so you love the phone and everything you do on the phone
[00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:47.440]   You can do in the laptop and it'll handle your home and we'll handle all this other stuff
[00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:50.320]   Google has never really done a good job with this ecosystem
[00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:52.320]   I
[00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:57.200]   Understand the home stuff all that right. I like the home. I disagree. I think
[00:30:57.200 --> 00:31:02.560]   the google nest home hub pod next max
[00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:05.680]   Game
[00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:10.160]   But that that thing is pretty good
[00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:15.680]   The little this thing screen thing the google nest hub max and the google nest hub. They're good
[00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:18.240]   uh, I think that
[00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:22.880]   They've done pretty well with the google assistant in these various devices
[00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:30.400]   Right. I mean amazon is the king of the hill, but I think google's so strong second and there's no third
[00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:33.040]   I can't think of syria's being third
[00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:38.560]   You know, they acquired fit bits which would lend some credence ant to your idea that maybe they'll do a fitness
[00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:41.120]   watch of some kind
[00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:45.920]   Uh, i would love to see that they fit they seems like they abandon and red wear i there just no
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.280]   They're not I mean fossils doing more with it and red where than they are
[00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:55.200]   Right. Yeah, I mean most most everybody seems to have a path in dandroid where except for uh fashion brands
[00:31:55.200 --> 00:32:00.400]   But I mean, you know just a hint of what to look forward to at google i.o a couple of events
[00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:06.160]   Um that are streaming from i.o and notably they are listed as showing off
[00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:12.880]   Uh, where and not where o s so some people are wondering if that's pointing to you know
[00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:17.440]   Kind of tying back into what you're talking about ant we've we've heard a lot of rumors about a pixel watch
[00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:22.160]   We've seen leaked photos on that like that's that's a product that has been fully leaked
[00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:28.560]   Uh in a number of different ways and we're just kind of like waiting for that to eventually happen if they're going such a hoham device
[00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:31.520]   You know, they just they're completely owned in this market
[00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:33.040]   uh totally
[00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:34.240]   Totally agree
[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:39.600]   It's it would be hard for them to come out with a with a wearable that gets everybody excited especially
[00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:41.840]   Nixi tubes
[00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:48.160]   Watch will have nixi tubes. I don't have that actually when they probably sell wet better than an android wear watch. I have
[00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:51.280]   Probably would sell better
[00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:55.360]   Uh the nest hub did show up at the bluetooth sig running fuchsia
[00:32:55.360 --> 00:33:00.720]   Yeah, that's interesting. That's the operating system google's been working on they've open sourced it
[00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:04.560]   When they've never really said exactly what fuchsia is intended to do
[00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:09.520]   Uh, I mean, it's been a long time since we had a new opera
[00:33:09.520 --> 00:33:14.400]   All right, could that be the announcement could they could they say we're replacing android and chrome the new os
[00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:17.520]   What nest hub uses chrome os I think right
[00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:21.680]   I believe that's not sure at least the original and it initial ones did
[00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:27.280]   I don't know if they stopped you and that was a bit of a surprise that they didn't use android they use chrome os
[00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:29.440]   um
[00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:31.440]   I
[00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:34.320]   Fuchsia might be an interesting play here
[00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:38.080]   Um, apparently wondering what the heck's gonna happen with fuchsia
[00:33:38.080 --> 00:33:42.960]   I mean and you know, they've been they've been putting out those little nuggets here and there if they were to come out
[00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:44.480]   at google io like
[00:33:44.480 --> 00:33:49.920]   The thing with fuchsia though is that I don't understand how deep that actually goes like I think this is interesting news
[00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:58.000]   Uh at the same time. This is fuchsia 1.0 as the operating system, you know on this listing is being attached to a piece of hardware
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.320]   That's two years old. I don't understand what that means
[00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:04.480]   Um, maybe that's like a place holder for something else like I
[00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:09.760]   I can't like wrap my head around what it means that they're doing that on our device has been out for a couple of years
[00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:16.320]   But I'm very curious to see what fuchsia actually is leading to and if they can come out at google
[00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:20.320]   Io and say all right you guys have had an insane amount of questions and rightfully so
[00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:24.880]   Here's what we're doing, you know every the all of your nest products or I don't know what their announcement would be
[00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:29.760]   But at least at least there's some excitement there because we've it's been building
[00:34:29.760 --> 00:34:33.520]   Towards something with this fuchsos that nobody understands at this point
[00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:37.440]   Well, I know it's going to be big because they have their own
[00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:40.560]   Twitter hashtag now
[00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:42.640]   So
[00:34:42.640 --> 00:34:48.960]   That means it's pretty darn serious, right? Yeah. Yeah, there it is. It's a little see little
[00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:56.320]   I don't know that is it's about time. It's a custom hashtag icon. You know you've made it on twitter when you have a custom hashtag
[00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:58.560]   Yeah
[00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:03.120]   I I this is going to be really really interesting Jason. We're sitting here
[00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:06.720]   We it's possible that we'll go. Oh my god
[00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:10.000]   Google's got their mojo back
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:16.080]   And they are firing on all cylinders. I honestly think it's much more likely. We'll say well
[00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:18.880]   Yeah, wasn't that special
[00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:27.840]   Yeah, I know and it's kind of like a kind of like at this point. I've been conditioned into that position
[00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:31.040]   I want the excitement just beat up again. Yeah, it's it's kind of a
[00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:37.680]   By being let down. You know remember going to google I own it was exciting and there was new stuff and you expected new interesting
[00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:45.440]   Innovations, you know part of the problem is they showed things like that simultaneous the translation with the pixel buds that was so cool
[00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:48.080]   or the making the
[00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:52.880]   Reservations of the chinese restaurant that was so cool and then never delivered on it
[00:35:52.880 --> 00:36:01.120]   Yeah, or removing the fence from the picture remember that the automatic removal of the scent the the chain link fence that never happened
[00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:04.720]   Instead of doing that they removed the head of photography and he went to adobe so
[00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:11.760]   There's been there's been a brain drain. There's been a bit of a brain drain frankly
[00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:17.360]   Absolutely, that's a bad sign too when you see people leaving that usually means they don't see a strong future
[00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:19.920]   In their field at that company
[00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:24.400]   Yeah, well you brought up the pixel buds. I should mention these pixel bud bud a
[00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:26.560]   series
[00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:29.680]   devices that you you've talked about on the show in weeks past
[00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:32.800]   Google messed up on the ad android
[00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:39.600]   Twitter account they posted a promotional image for it like a big announcement, you know touting its fast
[00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:46.960]   Pairing capabilities and then removed it 10 minutes later. So, so maybe that's the significance of Jeff. Oh geez
[00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:52.560]   We actually we finally have pixel buds that work they pay
[00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:59.040]   Fireworks, we didn't say they played but they pay it. Yeah, they pay exactly. That's all we promise
[00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:05.280]   I really wasn't that the one there you lose the only great thing about them, right? Which is the the the UI
[00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:11.280]   Yeah, I wasn't gonna say anything Jeff, but there's also remember they're gonna put fuchsia on the pixel books
[00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:16.400]   It's not gonna be not gonna make you happy at all
[00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:20.560]   No, maybe fine. Maybe better. I live love you to google. I'm fine
[00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:26.720]   Yeah, I mean really all you all the operating system on a pixel book is unless you're using is a Linux platform or something
[00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:33.520]   Is just a holder for the chrome which is where everything in the chrome browser is the whole thing really, right?
[00:37:33.520 --> 00:37:36.880]   it's funny because
[00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:39.120]   Then there's this headline at
[00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:47.520]   On the information which is very well connected as good reporters at booming google search chief gives more love to product managers
[00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:50.800]   This is you know like google's about to take off
[00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:56.720]   Um, they also broke the story that the state chief of stadia is leaving
[00:37:56.720 --> 00:37:58.960]   and
[00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:07.440]   What stadia was uh, what is that is that a thing where I think it's an uh, it's a pia what's holding io games? Yeah, yeah, okay
[00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:09.040]   All right
[00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:12.880]   Six additional staff leave stadia to join haven studios
[00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:17.600]   jade raimund was of course a big higher at stadia than when she left
[00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:18.960]   um a
[00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:25.760]   A lot more people followed her to haven studios, which is what she founded after she left stadia. So
[00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:32.320]   You can't look at stadia and think anything that except that it's over. I mean, it's it's over
[00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:38.560]   I mean the writing feels like it's on the wall. I don't I don't know what the end game is for stadia except the fact that that
[00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:44.480]   Bad news keeps pouring out about it and then the unfortunate thing is it's all
[00:38:44.480 --> 00:38:50.480]   Confirms the bad the bad feelings that people had when stadia was announced it was cool technology
[00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:53.040]   Really very ambitious
[00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:57.600]   But yet people immediately jumped on to the out and this is gonna fail like all other
[00:38:57.600 --> 00:39:01.280]   Google things because google's either gonna get bored or they're gonna know
[00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:06.160]   Reputation whatever and it's like history has proven itself again with with stadia
[00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:08.320]   I don't know what the future holds for stadia at this point
[00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:14.160]   All right, let's take a little break. Uh, we're gonna end the google gloom and doom report and give you some good news
[00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:16.560]   Yeah, as soon as I can find it

[00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:25.360]   um just hanging out and just talking
[00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:28.000]   tech and random stuff and
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.800]   Let me take all their chills. How's the best poker face?
[00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:39.040]   Not me. Yeah, you can tell look at him. Look at it. You don't know what's going on behind my eyes. It's a good hand
[00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:42.640]   That is good. Wow. Look at that. Oh, good
[00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:47.840]   Be blaked and I've been playing some valheim in there. We're getting that set up for later this week
[00:44:47.840 --> 00:44:51.440]   I'm gonna do it. Hold on. Well done play along. Yeah, you're very good
[00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:55.120]   I do that. I do that when I'm playing valheim except my face looks like this
[00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:59.680]   You can kind of tell what i'm thinking a trowel
[00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:05.280]   Uh, we're getting close to a countdown t minus
[00:45:05.280 --> 00:45:13.680]   258 two minutes of 58 seconds for a starship. This is a flight test into is this their deep space flight test john
[00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:16.400]   same
[00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:18.400]   Files miles up five miles down
[00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:23.920]   It's the hard thing is the landing have they landed without blowing up yet
[00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:30.640]   They landed and then they blew up so that's kind of still blowing up
[00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:33.360]   um the good news is
[00:45:33.360 --> 00:45:36.640]   There's no atmosphere really to be spoken of in on the moon
[00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:40.640]   So you won't blow up from the explain go ahead and show this shot. This is what I love about this
[00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:45.200]   The space starship is this is this ela musk space x
[00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:49.280]   Starship it's going to add the nasa did a deal with them to actually take
[00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:51.920]   uh people to the moon
[00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:57.680]   What I love about it is how it looks like a 1950s rocket ship like from a sci-fi movie
[00:45:57.680 --> 00:45:59.920]   and
[00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:03.600]   When they land on the moon they're gonna land like those rocket ships in a sci-fi movie
[00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:05.600]   That's why they're practicing those landings
[00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:10.960]   No, there's no gantry around it. Just it's just sitting like well on the moon
[00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:12.560]   There's not gonna be a gantry. It's gonna land like that
[00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:15.520]   It goes up it goes down. Yeah, that's uh, that's it
[00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:19.520]   uh nasa did a uh apparently it was the low cost leader
[00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:27.920]   Last nasa turned down jeff bezos is blue origin and uh, I think was it bowing that had uh
[00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:29.920]   uh
[00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:35.440]   A bid because they were so expensive one of the things that's really great about these um tests
[00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:41.680]   Is they have you know elan smart he puts good cameras on there john show the uh show the rocket
[00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:45.280]   Do we crash again there you there you go show the engines
[00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:50.400]   So you really get a good view of uh of that launch right before it blows up
[00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:55.920]   I mean not the not the launch the camera because the camera is right there in next to the engines
[00:46:56.560 --> 00:47:00.720]   And the separation's been good. There's people out there looking at it watch and I would love to go down
[00:47:00.720 --> 00:47:02.960]   Is this in florida? Where is he launching it?
[00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:06.560]   Yeah, it's lon texas from what it's launched
[00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:12.720]   That that's what uh folks in chat are saying a long two direct said. Oh, we're really way lagged. Oh man
[00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:15.760]   Yeah, so I think that feed that you're seeing is
[00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:20.720]   The
[00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:22.720]   SpaceX feed froze
[00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:25.600]   You know you can launch rockets, but uh
[00:47:26.480 --> 00:47:28.960]   You know you can't predict when it talk about streaming
[00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:32.400]   That's another problem. Both cacheka texas
[00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:34.640]   Um
[00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:37.920]   The day the earth stood still yeah boy that that feed is awful
[00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:40.720]   You know what I think that probably means a lot of people are
[00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:43.600]   Watching it right there's a lot of interest in this
[00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:48.640]   Because people are very interested in space. Yeah, somehow we went backwards in the countdown
[00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:50.720]   So I know we're not watching this in real time
[00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:57.120]   That's how you know it's already elon musk froze. Oh, this is t plus. It's already
[00:47:57.120 --> 00:48:03.360]   So that's oh that's in i see it's frozen, but it's up in space. Yeah, it's not space. It's in the air
[00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:08.720]   That is not that shot is not doing nothing. Okay. All right
[00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:15.920]   That's hilarious. They need one of mine. They need a nixie clock. I think for the countdown
[00:48:15.920 --> 00:48:20.960]   It went from 259 to one o'clock
[00:48:21.840 --> 00:48:23.840]   The clock did hall
[00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:26.480]   I didn't remember it with enough alcohol apparently
[00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:32.160]   Is it now at the one as it says it's one of us chop says this awfully low res
[00:48:32.160 --> 00:48:35.120]   Oh shut up
[00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:37.520]   I think he's talking about the nasa. No, he's talking about the
[00:48:37.520 --> 00:48:43.680]   Division was it coming back already? Is it coming down already? No, I saw flames. Yeah, this pretty quick, right?
[00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:48.560]   I would love to see the landing if we can get the boy. That's terrible video. Yeah, it's awful
[00:48:48.560 --> 00:48:50.720]   nice
[00:48:50.720 --> 00:48:53.600]   Well, they put the money elsewhere. It'll it'll do
[00:48:53.600 --> 00:49:00.480]   Well, you know, it's actually really important. Yeah, I'm sorry about the clock. It went backwards, didn't it?
[00:49:00.480 --> 00:49:05.760]   It's me. It's my fault. I said it weird. I have to get back. Yeah, I haven't done any uh setting on the clock
[00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:09.760]   We're gonna relive the last hour. Yeah. Oh boy
[00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:14.640]   Right about now. I was carefully wiping the tubes with alcohol
[00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:19.040]   Do you like to go back? Oh, the here goes here we go
[00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:22.400]   a little bit better video
[00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:28.000]   Yeah, is this is it going down or up which direction can we tell that is that the horizon?
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:31.200]   It's leveled off. Yeah
[00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:37.280]   I just I it's a planet sure looked flat to me
[00:49:37.280 --> 00:49:42.480]   Wait a minute. It's curved wait a minute
[00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:49.360]   Apparently speaking of the new pixel phone there is a rumor that it will have uwb in it
[00:49:49.360 --> 00:49:54.160]   This is something that apples made a lot of with on the air tags the next pixel phone
[00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:56.880]   Uh could hop on the ultra
[00:49:56.880 --> 00:50:01.520]   Wide bandwagon along with sam-sung and apples sam-sung and i's already using it
[00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:06.960]   It's really a cool way to do a lot of things you can aim at things you can find things
[00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:13.040]   Uh, sam-sung has their smart tags apple has we're about to land their tags. Oh, let's watch
[00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:15.920]   It's coming down
[00:50:15.920 --> 00:50:23.200]   Stop it. Come on. Come on. Come on. Oh boy. That's you got it. Is that
[00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:26.160]   It's hard to tell
[00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:31.040]   Yeah, bokachika's got a lot of fall. We know yeah
[00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:35.360]   I'm not going
[00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:38.080]   It looks pretty good
[00:50:38.080 --> 00:50:41.680]   Remember last time there was a small leak that eventually
[00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:46.400]   Caught fire, but this looks pretty stable
[00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:50.160]   Awesome. That's important because that's what it needs to do on the moon, right?
[00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:56.160]   And of course take off again afterwards, right? Nice very cool
[00:50:56.160 --> 00:51:03.200]   Yeah, uwb back to the uwb story from my understanding michaal roman from xda was the
[00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:09.120]   The person who got the kind of information from a source nine to five google confirmed it
[00:51:09.120 --> 00:51:12.240]   It was specific to udb or sorry
[00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:15.120]   Sorry ultra wide. Yeah uwb
[00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:23.040]   Um an api being created and so they were positing does this mean that the next pixel would have support for ultra wide
[00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:24.720]   Um
[00:51:24.720 --> 00:51:32.240]   Yeah, oh interesting. So so i don't know a lot of information then i don't know that it necessarily means that the pixel six is going to have that support
[00:51:32.240 --> 00:51:35.120]   But it definitely means that google is working on building the support
[00:51:35.120 --> 00:51:39.120]   Into android probably in a similar way to what they did with foldables where
[00:51:39.520 --> 00:51:42.640]   Everybody was kind of doing their own thing with foldables and then finally google was like
[00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:46.880]   Hey, we're gonna make an official api to support these multiple displays
[00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:49.040]   And so that everybody's on the same page
[00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:55.600]   So it could at the at the least be that for android and at the most who knows maybe the pixel six will actually have support for it too
[00:51:55.600 --> 00:51:57.600]   Which would be good it'd be current
[00:51:57.600 --> 00:52:04.160]   You know here's an argument for there being a new pixel book jeff chrome books dominate
[00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:08.560]   That's a strong word dominate the global pc market
[00:52:09.120 --> 00:52:11.280]   275 growth
[00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:16.960]   I have to think this the pandemic has something to do with that and hp is currently never returned
[00:52:16.960 --> 00:52:18.960]   Yeah, sure
[00:52:18.960 --> 00:52:21.360]   Look at the
[00:52:21.360 --> 00:52:27.680]   Yeah, look at that graph. So this gray line is and it started at a q3 the big growth q3 to q4
[00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:33.200]   What we care about is is connectivity in the web. This is the connected age. It's not the it's not the software age. Yeah, you're right
[00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:36.080]   In fact, it's clear, you know, even
[00:52:36.080 --> 00:52:38.720]   Companies like microsofter starting to look at
[00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:42.800]   You know, basically running the operating system in the cloud
[00:52:42.800 --> 00:52:46.320]   That's why I wonder whether I mean it is
[00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:49.520]   I'm not saying this fuchsia
[00:52:49.520 --> 00:52:54.720]   But I think that there's there's a moment here for some leaps in os
[00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:58.720]   We haven't been there in a while. I don't know what it would be
[00:53:02.240 --> 00:53:06.800]   Just make it work. That's the main thing chrome does chrome
[00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:10.320]   Light
[00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:12.880]   I don't know. I have my moments with it
[00:53:12.880 --> 00:53:16.000]   It's especially from a resources perspective
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:19.840]   Um, well, you're you're you're trying to run a rocket ship on a
[00:53:19.840 --> 00:53:23.280]   Hyundai. I know not a rocket ship just a tank
[00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:31.040]   The only negative on this is if you look at the top sellers of uh chromebooks
[00:53:31.760 --> 00:53:34.800]   HP Lenovo Acer Samsung Dell
[00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:38.720]   And others I don't see the word google in there at all
[00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:43.200]   Well, because they haven't had a new one in shocking. Yeah, really and and four years
[00:53:43.200 --> 00:53:47.840]   Yeah, the pooks will go that was a couple of years. That doesn't count. That was a
[00:53:47.840 --> 00:53:50.080]   No
[00:53:50.080 --> 00:53:51.920]   Well, it's a chromebook
[00:53:51.920 --> 00:53:59.040]   It was their chromebook. You want to I know it you want a high-end chromebook. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, mr
[00:53:59.040 --> 00:54:01.040]   Jarvis if it makes you feel any better
[00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:05.680]   Queen Pruitt's laptop was just totally on the fritts and I said
[00:54:05.680 --> 00:54:12.400]   Don't you don't need a laptop. Just go get a chromebook and so she did just go out
[00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:19.680]   She happy and she is happy because it allows her access to the web just to do simple stuff on the web
[00:54:19.680 --> 00:54:25.040]   She doesn't need to do a whole bunch of computing stuff. Just connect to the web use google docs. She's trying to
[00:54:25.520 --> 00:54:31.840]   Run things with her plain tastic pot heads and that chromebook is totally fine. It was under 300 bucks
[00:54:31.840 --> 00:54:34.800]   There you go. You see that's how you use the light room. Yeah
[00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:36.400]   Perfect
[00:54:36.400 --> 00:54:41.280]   Perfect for that. All right when we can wonder I wonder if you look at what's happening with android
[00:54:41.280 --> 00:54:45.280]   And how they put more computing locally on on the phone
[00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:51.600]   Whether without having to get into a whole mess with windows and apple of installing software and stuff
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:56.720]   Could you look more stuff locally on to a laptop to handle finally photos and videos?
[00:54:56.720 --> 00:54:59.680]   The real thing missing here is photos and videos once you get that
[00:54:59.680 --> 00:55:05.600]   Solved the chrome there's no reason I would argue unless you're programming unless you're doing the specialized things
[00:55:05.600 --> 00:55:10.080]   For 99 percent what you need the chromebooks gonna be fine. Yep. I agree with you
[00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:16.960]   And when you say photos and videos, what do you mean like a photo photo of video manipulation or just photo?
[00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:21.600]   Yeah, you really can't you can't edit video. Yeah. Yeah, I would be I would love to have our students
[00:55:22.080 --> 00:55:27.760]   Switch to chromebook could be a lot cheaper for them to be great and they could for everything except doing
[00:55:27.760 --> 00:55:32.960]   You can do retouching but you're going to do a really hardcore editing
[00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:34.320]   on photos
[00:55:34.320 --> 00:55:39.280]   Well, I blame google for this because uh if you wanted to if you really wanted to support the
[00:55:39.280 --> 00:55:43.440]   Pixelbook you'd make google photos have better editing tools
[00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:48.800]   Yeah, right if they did that I think that then you could say you could point to that and say look
[00:55:49.360 --> 00:55:51.920]   They'll store unlimited well, I'm not limited
[00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:58.160]   There a lot of photos up there in the cloud and they give you editing tools
[00:55:58.160 --> 00:56:03.680]   They do all the other good stuff that google photos does that's all they are making an effort with it
[00:56:03.680 --> 00:56:08.480]   They're trying so, you know, they just recently added those sharpening then denoise in tools
[00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:12.480]   Right. It was a pretty pretty significant tool. They don't get rid of fences. It's just and
[00:56:12.480 --> 00:56:15.760]   Remove fences
[00:56:16.320 --> 00:56:21.920]   Um, but yeah, so I haven't really used the editor that much. Have you used it at all and is it decent?
[00:56:21.920 --> 00:56:29.360]   I use it often on the phone for quick hitter stuff to put out on instagram stories something like that, but that's about it
[00:56:29.360 --> 00:56:35.120]   Yeah, how's the kind of strikes me as the use case for for the editing because you've got before those anyways
[00:56:35.120 --> 00:56:38.000]   That's what you're gonna be exactly if you care that if you care enough
[00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:41.280]   You're gonna jump jump into the light rooms and and that sort of thing
[00:56:41.680 --> 00:56:48.800]   All right, I don't know that google's necessarily paying, you know, positioning google photos to be the solution for professional photographers either
[00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:50.960]   No, no, no, not much about that. No
[00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:54.000]   Yeah, well, I think there are people buying Chromebooks either
[00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:59.280]   All right, but the people that are buying chromebooks should still have some decent tools though. I mean, they shouldn't be left
[00:56:59.280 --> 00:57:03.760]   That's what i'm saying. Yeah, exactly right. That's exactly what i'm saying and that's up to google
[00:57:03.760 --> 00:57:08.000]   So they have filters. I mean i'm playing with these filters. That's kind of fun
[00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:10.160]   um
[00:57:10.160 --> 00:57:15.040]   But where's the where's the rest of the editing is there any more editing anywhere? It was under that menu
[00:57:15.040 --> 00:57:17.680]   Over to the right
[00:57:17.680 --> 00:57:21.040]   Here it says this and then right there this menu in the center
[00:57:21.040 --> 00:57:25.920]   There used to be a lot of difference not a lot. It used to be a little drop down. So there you go
[00:57:25.920 --> 00:57:31.040]   Okay, so this is a lot of what you could do in light room in light room. I mean not
[00:57:31.040 --> 00:57:33.520]   uh, you know, I mean
[00:57:33.520 --> 00:57:39.680]   It's pretty basic. Is there something to be said for the quality of these particular adjustments in a
[00:57:39.920 --> 00:57:44.720]   Program like light room versus what google is offering in the cloud at like like you as like a
[00:57:44.720 --> 00:57:53.040]   Someone all right there familiar with that aunt would would know that panel right there is very comparable to the free version of light room
[00:57:53.040 --> 00:57:55.280]   Yeah, it's very comparable
[00:57:55.280 --> 00:58:00.480]   In some ways you kind of got it's got more ai capability. I like that skin tone. Yeah
[00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:02.960]   um
[00:58:02.960 --> 00:58:06.080]   Yeah, it's fun. I you know pop needs more than just
[00:58:06.800 --> 00:58:10.080]   Was you you bring up pop that's like the go-to?
[00:58:10.080 --> 00:58:16.880]   And the option of queen pruit she she loves to pop her images up and the first thing she looks for is pop
[00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:22.720]   And she goes to social because it does look pretty good with most of the things that she she and the filters
[00:58:22.720 --> 00:58:24.960]   You know if you're used to instagram or
[00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:30.640]   You know a photo app and on your phone this very much something like you're used to so
[00:58:30.640 --> 00:58:35.600]   Auto does it actually auto does the best job. That's actually a pretty good shop with the auto
[00:58:36.160 --> 00:58:38.160]   Yeah, yeah agreed. Yeah
[00:58:38.160 --> 00:58:46.080]   Uh, all right. Let me let's take a little break and uh come back with more of the action. So it looks like a
[00:58:46.080 --> 00:58:48.560]   SpaceX
[00:58:48.560 --> 00:58:50.560]   Starship landed and is
[00:58:50.560 --> 00:58:56.880]   Hasn't blown up yet. Yeah, still standing. So that's it. That's very sick. I don't want a jinx. It. That was the thing
[00:58:56.880 --> 00:59:02.080]   Yeah, no, I don't want a jinx it either. I want to buy it. You have lower the expectations, right?
[00:59:02.080 --> 00:59:04.800]   It's the results, right?
[00:59:05.280 --> 00:59:07.840]   It's gonna blow up. Oh, it doesn't. Hey, what a happy
[00:59:07.840 --> 00:59:13.440]   I showed it. I brought to you by nirava, you know where people are coming back
[00:59:13.440 --> 00:59:19.600]   Uh, the offices are starting to fill but people are still nervous and rightly so and they want to be careful and you want a social distanced
[00:59:19.600 --> 00:59:22.640]   Uh, it's going to change distance is really going to change
[00:59:22.640 --> 00:59:28.080]   Meeting remedial as people come back and may require changes in room configurations
[00:59:28.080 --> 00:59:32.640]   And that means usually terrible sound right? No, not if you're using nirava
[00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:38.080]   Nirava gives you great mic coverage even when people are socially distanced in a meeting space
[00:59:38.080 --> 00:59:42.640]   It's not no it's not beamforming beam forwarding performing systems need adjustments
[00:59:42.640 --> 00:59:45.200]   Usually by an expensive technician
[00:59:45.200 --> 00:59:50.160]   Uh, you might have a tabletop kind of system right now, but you know, there's one in the middle
[00:59:50.160 --> 00:59:54.480]   You're going to need multiple mics and then each one has to be sanitized between meetings
[00:59:54.480 --> 00:59:58.880]   You may have to change how you behave in a meeting sit in a predetermined spot
[00:59:58.880 --> 01:00:02.960]   Face in a particular direction. None of that's good. You want nirava
[01:00:03.680 --> 01:00:10.080]   But what if there a better way to get clear reliable audio let your team act naturally and still feels safe
[01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:18.000]   One analyst called nirava audio the first socially distanced mic system and it all comes down to a patented technology
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:22.800]   Only nirava can do they call it microphone mist for patents
[01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:25.840]   It it actually in effect
[01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:29.360]   Fills the room with thousands of virtual microphones
[01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:33.520]   And the audio automatically adapts to any configuration
[01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:41.040]   The hdl 300 system they have a variety of them the hdl 300 is the first microphone and speaker bar to be certified for large
[01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:45.040]   Meaning spaces up to 15 feet by 28 feet. That's huge
[01:00:45.040 --> 01:00:50.400]   But you still get true full room coverage people could be heard from anywhere in the room
[01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:55.520]   Doesn't matter where they're sit doesn't even matter where they're facing or how they're distanced
[01:00:56.240 --> 01:00:58.240]   It's kind of magical
[01:00:58.240 --> 01:01:04.720]   And you don't need to bring in technicians. You can install each microphone and speaker bar on the wall by yourself
[01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:07.120]   It's easy
[01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:11.360]   And then you've got the nirava console which puts device management into your hands and on your terms
[01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:18.560]   You're going to adjust settings install firmware updates check device status and more all from a secure cloud based platform
[01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:23.280]   Console comes with every single nirava audio system
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:29.440]   And it's kind of a little bonus when you enroll your system you'll receive an extra year of warranty absolutely free
[01:01:29.440 --> 01:01:38.080]   Narava products people rave about them. They've won many awards including top new technology at ISE 2020 for the hdl 200 system
[01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:45.120]   But no matter what size your room is they have a full line of systems to fit your needs from small to medium to large spaces
[01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:49.680]   You know where people are using narayva you can kind of tell because the sound is great even though people are
[01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:52.080]   Spread all out around the room
[01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:55.920]   Hubspot uses at jimmy yan who's their principal collaboration engineer says quote
[01:01:55.920 --> 01:02:02.080]   We were so impressed with the sound quality the ease of install and the ease of use of our hdl 300
[01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:04.560]   It was a no-brainer for us to adopt it
[01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:11.680]   To learn more how nirava audio is the simple and cost effective way to let your teams distance and meetings is still act and converse naturally

[01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:27.440]   Even after the pandemic you're going to be very glad you'd have an array of a system in there great audio
[01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:33.200]   No matter how people sit no matter how people face that's that's worth its weight in gold
[01:02:33.200 --> 01:02:41.760]   Narava, thank you Narava for supporting this week in google. Thank you for supporting it by going to nirava.com/twit
[01:02:41.760 --> 01:02:44.800]   Should we do a
[01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:47.040]   I wish I could get Jason to do the google change lock
[01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:53.280]   That's my that's my goal of life. Jason too bad. He's not on the show. Oh rats
[01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:56.080]   Actually before we do that
[01:02:56.080 --> 01:03:01.040]   You did you did put it this article in here that i've got to know more about mr. Beast
[01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:05.920]   Who is no what who is mr. Who is actually i didn't actually i didn't actually didn't put that in there
[01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:07.680]   Can explain it
[01:03:07.680 --> 01:03:12.720]   Well, yeah, so i mean i'll do my best to explain it basically you know taylor lorens she's awesome
[01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:19.760]   New York Times she does such a good job of writing about just everything that's going on in the social world and especially you know
[01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:23.520]   TikTok and youtube and all that kind of stuff. She did kind of a feature on
[01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:27.600]   youtube star who you may or may not have heard of called mr. Beast
[01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:30.960]   And uh, I just saw jeff that you put it in there and i'm like, oh, yeah
[01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:38.800]   I've i've seen so many of his videos because of my kids his whole shtick and basically he's like one of the most popular youtubers at this point
[01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:42.320]   I love how that like top spot is so fluid, you know
[01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:45.760]   Couple of years ago it was pewdiepie and that was the name everyone knew
[01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:50.880]   A pair prepare yourselves for mr. Gold fart. No, i've been hearing that mr. Beast for months
[01:03:50.880 --> 01:03:53.920]   Yeah, in fact i've seen his videos this he's a guy gives away money
[01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:58.240]   Yeah, so that's kind of his deal is he gets these sponsorships where he's he
[01:03:58.240 --> 01:04:04.480]   Is given like a million dollars to give out, you know in some grand way where he just kind of goes out on the street
[01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:07.600]   And you know starts talking to someone and hands them a suitcase full of money
[01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:09.840]   So I was wondering where he got the money from okay
[01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:14.480]   So people yeah sponsors give him the money because that when I saw it it's like he doesn't say where it came from
[01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:18.640]   And it's like you have just a thousand bucks to give people randomly. What's the deal?
[01:04:18.640 --> 01:04:24.880]   Well, you know, he's also making an insane amount of money off of off of you know all of these videos
[01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:28.640]   He's he's figured out what works for the algorithm to get people to watch
[01:04:28.640 --> 01:04:31.840]   I think he has something like 36 different people
[01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:35.440]   Working for him. So he's got a full production arm
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:40.160]   Always coming up with these new ideas, you know what uh some of them are like, you know
[01:04:40.160 --> 01:04:43.680]   He he isolates himself in a room for like 48 hours
[01:04:43.680 --> 01:04:46.320]   And he just has to be in there with absolutely nothing to do
[01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:49.840]   And it's just a video of like him in a room and all of his friends on the outside
[01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:54.720]   Just doing pranks on him to try and you know drive him crazy over the course of 48 hours
[01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:57.280]   It's actually pretty entertaining. I have to say like
[01:04:57.280 --> 01:04:58.640]   I
[01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:04.880]   It's easy to get pulled into it and uh and not feel like what what I realized in watching some of his videos is
[01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:09.200]   There's a lot of stuff on youtube that I watch it and at the end like I just kind of feel gross
[01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:14.400]   Like what did I do? What did I just yeah, why and and at least with his like there's a little bit of like a
[01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:17.680]   Uh, you know, he's giving he's giving money to people
[01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:21.040]   There's something nice about like the fact that he's truly authentically
[01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:26.720]   Surprising these people with something that literally, you know could has the potential to change their lives in that moment
[01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:30.640]   Yes, he's doing it because it makes him a star it makes him more more
[01:05:30.640 --> 01:05:32.720]   You know get some more subscribers and everything
[01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:35.840]   But you can find in my opinion you can find a lot worse on youtube than
[01:05:35.840 --> 01:05:41.040]   It's so funny how what goes around comes around because radio stations for years have been giving away
[01:05:41.040 --> 01:05:47.840]   Money to get listeners. It's it's not new according to the new york times he started in middle school in 2012
[01:05:47.840 --> 01:05:49.840]   and he
[01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:56.400]   Apparently his one and only goal was becoming youtube star because he cycled through different genres trying to figure out
[01:05:56.400 --> 01:06:00.800]   How to get the attention of the youtube recommendation algorithm?
[01:06:01.200 --> 01:06:03.200]   He played games
[01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:06.640]   He commented on youtube drama. He uploaded funny video compilations
[01:06:06.640 --> 01:06:13.520]   Did reaction videos for a while it was a couple of years ago. He discovered giving away thousands of dollars
[01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:17.600]   Who knew giving away thousands of dollars and cash to random people
[01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:19.120]   uh
[01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:22.000]   Would be a recipe for success
[01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:26.160]   Uh, he rebranded himself youtube's biggest philanthropist
[01:06:26.480 --> 01:06:31.200]   He declined a comment for the story because there have been there's some cracks
[01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:34.320]   In the the armor ones he apparently
[01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:41.280]   Pushed a cryptocurrency scam that or scheme maybe not a scam that uh cost people
[01:06:41.280 --> 01:06:46.640]   Money he promoted it and invested in it, but there be some fans lost a lot of money
[01:06:46.640 --> 01:06:50.640]   Um, and you know, I have to say that one of the problems with youtube
[01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:56.320]   In a way is uh, it loans it lends itself to this exact kind of thing
[01:06:56.960 --> 01:07:02.480]   Uh, which is you know here. I just gonna give you money. That's not content. Yeah, right?
[01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:06.720]   That's buying an audience although it ends up being content because it's interesting to see the reactions
[01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:10.320]   And then the problem is and this is where we'll see how well he does
[01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:13.520]   It then becomes very difficult to top yourself
[01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:20.320]   And and people get tired and they move on and you have to find and say that about all of the platforms where that's tick-tock
[01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:24.720]   YouTube's worst any any algorithmically driven platform is going to be bad because
[01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:27.440]   You know attention moves on the algorithm
[01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:33.840]   Boosts you up very quickly it can take you down just as quickly and then you get that desperation
[01:07:33.840 --> 01:07:39.840]   Oh, what do I do to keep you know keep this uh keep this thing going? I've got 36 mouths to feed
[01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:42.960]   Uh, eventually gave back a million dollars by the way
[01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:48.480]   Uh, he is i've heard of him, but I never watched in his videos. The only reason I
[01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:54.560]   Took it sent my interest was because he was from carolina. Right and he's a kid. He's 22
[01:07:55.280 --> 01:07:59.920]   Uh and parents like you Jason like him because at least he isn't filthy. He's a swear
[01:07:59.920 --> 01:08:02.640]   You know, he's not pranking people
[01:08:02.640 --> 01:08:05.200]   So he's palatable
[01:08:05.200 --> 01:08:08.800]   Uh, although apparently a way to put it. Yeah, he's palatable
[01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:16.480]   Like I can I can stand watching his videos some of the videos that end up on the on the tv when they're watching youtube
[01:08:16.480 --> 01:08:20.240]   I'm just like, uh, like this just like nails on a chalkboard
[01:08:20.640 --> 01:08:26.080]   It's none of it is none of it is educational by the way like I I still don't know how I feel about like
[01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:32.560]   Watching for entertainment this like hyper drive of uh of spreading money all over the place
[01:08:32.560 --> 01:08:39.200]   You know like what is the value like what is like the the like ethical or moral value that comes out of that sort of content
[01:08:39.200 --> 01:08:44.720]   I'm not sure you know, I certainly don't know the answer to have you know, I heard of a show called queen for a day
[01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:49.920]   Yeah, that's exactly what he's doing. It's queen for a day. Right and so it's it's poverty porn too
[01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:56.880]   It's it's over. You're all gonna feel good. I mean tv all media are made to make you feel better and superior to the rest of the world
[01:08:56.880 --> 01:09:00.720]   Hmm. He created the way is that oh, I'm in better shape
[01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:03.920]   He's also right. He's also doing what a lot of these guys do
[01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:07.520]   Which is you got to figure out where to put the money and how to keep the money coming in
[01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:14.080]   He's he's done a lot of it's interesting. He's obviously a go getter. He created a ghost kitchen frances
[01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:16.080]   This is the mr. Beast burger
[01:09:16.480 --> 01:09:21.120]   That's that kudos for that. I don't think you're I think that's actually three of them. I don't think you're supposed to eat that
[01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:23.760]   No
[01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:30.400]   That's one of the topics of his video. Yeah, he uh, he opened he says I literally just opened 300 restaurants all across america
[01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:33.440]   But we only serve people through delivery apps
[01:09:33.440 --> 01:09:41.040]   When a customer orders from the mr. Beast burger in mid-vail utah the food is prepared at a location of bucca de beppo
[01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:43.920]   Which is an Italian china? I used to eat there
[01:09:44.080 --> 01:09:48.560]   Yeah, and then manhattan mr. Beast burgers are made at handcraft kitchen and cocktails
[01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:53.280]   So it's called a ghost franchise because you I guess bet in effect you just
[01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:57.600]   Put a name on something that somebody else is is making. I don't know he also
[01:09:57.600 --> 01:09:59.840]   uh
[01:09:59.840 --> 01:10:01.840]   Let's see has a mobile gaming app
[01:10:01.840 --> 01:10:09.520]   He wants to be elon musk one day. He says how many times have I heard that? Yeah, right, right
[01:10:10.080 --> 01:10:15.440]   I mean he's 22 and he's done a heck of a lot in a short amount of time at a young age like yeah
[01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:22.160]   I gotta get a loop props for his entrepreneurial drive. Yeah, he's clearly that. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah
[01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:25.040]   Um
[01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:27.040]   Pretty impressive mr. Beast
[01:10:27.040 --> 01:10:29.920]   Yeah, I've been hearing his name for a while actually
[01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:33.440]   Yeah, I don't know from whom but I I yeah
[01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:39.440]   Someone who we don't know yet will out mr. Beast. Yeah, mr. Beast in two years at least somebody else
[01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:42.640]   Yeah, exactly. That's just the way youtube seems to seem strong
[01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:45.840]   YouTube if you if you want to watch up
[01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:49.360]   I didn't even work with us but queen for a day the videos are amazing
[01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:54.960]   Yeah, it's a sob story. So the you get to be queen for the day by telling the saddest
[01:10:54.960 --> 01:10:57.040]   story like
[01:10:57.040 --> 01:11:01.120]   You know my husband left me and then the house burned down and now the kids need dental work
[01:11:01.120 --> 01:11:06.720]   And the whole thing is is about watching these people and then they pick one of these right jeff uh
[01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:11.520]   There were several on the show. This this show was started before I was born. Yeah. Yeah, it's really old at all
[01:11:11.520 --> 01:11:14.080]   And they give you you know a
[01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:19.760]   Maytag washing machine. You take washer, right? Yeah, you know boy. I can now wash the family's clothes. Yeah
[01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:22.240]   I wish I had a house to do it in. Yeah
[01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:24.800]   You know, uh, all right
[01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:30.480]   So this morning the oversight board decided what to do about Donald's
[01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:32.480]   Trump
[01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:36.000]   Wait a minute. Hold on. We sort of supposed to get a popcorn break for this
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.640]   Get your popcorn
[01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:40.480]   So
[01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:46.720]   Maybe be you know and the former president had made noises about starting a social network, but you know, he's he's very
[01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:48.560]   Add and is
[01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:51.120]   I think eventually put something on his blog
[01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:54.560]   Like he's posting a blasey start a blog
[01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:59.680]   He's really heard he's really lost frankly without twitter
[01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:04.640]   Uh, how important is facebook to him? I don't know. What was the what was the decision?
[01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:08.400]   Jeff, I so the decision was was was I think odd
[01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:12.800]   Uh, the legal twitter thinks it's nuanced and fascinating. I don't
[01:12:12.800 --> 01:12:17.440]   What they said was you were right to take him down. You were wrong to make it indefinite
[01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:22.960]   You uh are not clear with your rules and you didn't have a bunch of rules and you didn't really
[01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:28.560]   Enforce where this was and why it was and within six months. We insist they use the urban system
[01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:31.040]   We insist that facebook come back
[01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:36.880]   with another decision so that decision could be in six months that
[01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:39.280]   um
[01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:43.280]   It's permanent he ain't coming back ever, which is what jack dorsey has done
[01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:48.320]   Uh just on his own authority without an oversight board or it could be that
[01:12:48.320 --> 01:12:53.840]   Um, we've decided that he's performed. He's seen the burning bush. Uh, he can go back up
[01:12:55.200 --> 01:12:59.440]   So it's a non decision decision. Absolutely. So what they did was they threw the ball back
[01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:04.560]   Across now the legal people were saying well, I really showed how facebook, uh is inconsistent
[01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:09.040]   Yeah, we already knew that and um, you know put the put it back on facebook
[01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:13.280]   They couldn't put this on the oversight board. Well, the oversight board shouldn't have taken the decision in the first place
[01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:16.400]   They were gonna say no, we're not gonna they should have said that in the first place
[01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:20.160]   So what's happened now what sets mean about this now is that
[01:13:20.160 --> 01:13:22.400]   um
[01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:26.720]   It's it's it's a it's a vice. It's a wedge. It's gonna sit there for six months
[01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:33.120]   And so you're gonna have cancel culture whining going on from the right constantly waiting to see what facebook does facebook is gonna
[01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:35.280]   be nervous as hell
[01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:36.240]   um
[01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:43.360]   And neither organization neither facebook nor the oversight board took the opportunity to discuss the behavior itself
[01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:50.240]   They concentrated as the oversight board has been doing on a statutory level of the really fine nitty gritty of it
[01:13:50.480 --> 01:13:52.880]   Of like what do you post it that day to my mind?
[01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:54.880]   I'll be politically here for a moment pardon me for this
[01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:58.080]   The big lie alone is reason to take them off
[01:13:58.080 --> 01:14:02.640]   And leave them off, but they didn't deal with that. They didn't deal with the bigger issues
[01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:08.400]   They didn't deal. They you know, they had pappin there about how important democracy is but they didn't deal with the impact on democracy
[01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:14.240]   Neither body did so they've both just punted in their own way facebook did take them down
[01:14:14.240 --> 01:14:16.320]   They did something level late in my view, but they did something
[01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:21.680]   But then they punted to go to the oversight board and the oversight board punted back. It's like lucy in the football
[01:14:21.680 --> 01:14:24.640]   and and again meanwhile, I watch
[01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:29.360]   You know, they've been people say oh mark soccer books too powerful. He did makes two big decisions
[01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:32.560]   Well, he they didn't make the decisions meanwhile jack dorsey
[01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:35.760]   Changed the world immensely by saying this is enough
[01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:39.840]   I'm taking him down and he's been down and it's been quiet and it's made a difference
[01:14:39.840 --> 01:14:43.520]   It has been so in a way. I want a more authoritarian company. Yeah
[01:14:44.960 --> 01:14:49.920]   Interesting for mr. Jarvis. Yes, you um in your thread here you said
[01:14:49.920 --> 01:14:59.360]   Facebook should keep trump banned because of quote his uttering present imminent danger to democracy
[01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:06.720]   What exactly did you mean by that sir? I mean the big lie. I mean I mean saying that an election is invalid
[01:15:06.720 --> 01:15:10.880]   And saying that it has no value and trying to convince people of that
[01:15:11.440 --> 01:15:14.400]   tears up down a pillar of democracy
[01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:17.440]   And pretty funny because
[01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:19.440]   Even though he has no pulpit anymore
[01:15:19.440 --> 01:15:22.720]   It's like kind of on his own because there's no reason that he couldn't be
[01:15:22.720 --> 01:15:25.520]   Putting out press releases and doing interviews and stuff
[01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:31.680]   But mostly what he seems to be doing is wandering aimlessly around mara lago until he finds a group of people and then telling him
[01:15:31.680 --> 01:15:36.480]   You know, I won that election. It's all it was all a I mean, it's a very strange
[01:15:36.480 --> 01:15:39.280]   almost it is kind of
[01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:43.360]   Citizen Kane kind of bizarre and would be poignant if
[01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:48.800]   Yeah, we're human. Yeah, well, it's it's very it's odd. It's very interesting. Yeah
[01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:54.640]   Is the florida bill this is kind of in response to what facebook and twitter did
[01:15:54.640 --> 01:15:59.440]   florida bill is so everybody. I'm sorry you want to play it first
[01:15:59.440 --> 01:16:05.200]   Yeah, so this bill which I don't know if if desantis has signed it yet. Uh, it was past
[01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:12.240]   I he he wanted it. So I imagine you'll by now have signed it. It was passed by the florida house of representatives
[01:16:12.240 --> 01:16:19.280]   Uh by a vote of 77 to 38 and then she's the other house. Yeah, it was just but the bill
[01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:21.360]   is
[01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:23.360]   nutty it says
[01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:29.680]   Uh, if you're a social network and you deplatform political candidates, you're gonna you're gonna get a fine
[01:16:29.680 --> 01:16:34.240]   Uh, oh, I guess it's in reconciliation right now. So
[01:16:35.680 --> 01:16:40.080]   The bill is now going to the senate to approve the changes made by the house the senate version call for fines of
[01:16:40.080 --> 01:16:42.720]   $10,000 a day
[01:16:42.720 --> 01:16:44.720]   for banning a political candidate
[01:16:44.720 --> 01:16:48.640]   100,000 a day if the candidate was running for election
[01:16:48.640 --> 01:16:54.960]   Then the house version said no, that's not enough. They they bumped the fines up even more and almost more than doubled them
[01:16:54.960 --> 01:16:57.840]   Uh
[01:16:57.840 --> 01:17:04.240]   It doesn't apply to temporary social media bans and it wouldn't apply to instances with a platform roo specific posts
[01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:06.720]   That violate the terms of service
[01:17:06.720 --> 01:17:14.160]   But any social media ban that lasts longer than 60 days both facebook's and twitter's bans have would result in a fine
[01:17:14.160 --> 01:17:16.320]   I
[01:17:16.320 --> 01:17:21.280]   Strikes me that this is a violation of the first amendment so clearly in relation to
[01:17:21.280 --> 01:17:25.680]   To by a state to regulate interstate commerce. So it's gonna fail
[01:17:25.680 --> 01:17:33.600]   Around it. Yeah, it's yeah. It's and what's weird is they they they actually included an exemption
[01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:39.680]   Yeah, for any information service system internet search engine or access software provider
[01:17:39.680 --> 01:17:46.080]   Operated by a company that owns and operates a theme park or large entertainment complex
[01:17:46.080 --> 01:17:49.200]   Who's in florida? Oh
[01:17:49.200 --> 01:17:53.840]   The exemption was included so that the disney plus streaming service isn't caught up in this
[01:17:53.840 --> 01:17:59.200]   And and comp guys and disney world. Yeah, right. Um, wow
[01:17:59.200 --> 01:18:02.800]   It's just ridiculous. It's really just absurd
[01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:07.760]   And it's they say it's not about president trump, but it's it's clearly
[01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:11.840]   It was stimulated by the ban from twitter and facebook
[01:18:11.840 --> 01:18:17.200]   I can't imagine it'll hold up in court. I don't know what will happen. No way. Yeah, no
[01:18:17.200 --> 01:18:22.480]   I have a question. It's just gonna show my ignorance on all of this. So and i'm okay with that
[01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:25.200]   this ban of
[01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:27.840]   trump is essentially because of what happened
[01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:32.400]   um far as the insurrection or a collection of everything
[01:18:33.280 --> 01:18:35.280]   So if the insurrection
[01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:38.080]   It's a good question because it
[01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:44.480]   Yes, it's primarily january 6th and the insurrection that was the last straw wasn't it was also a last straw exactly
[01:18:44.480 --> 01:18:50.240]   Right. That's what i was asked if the insurrection had never happened, you know, could we potentially still
[01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:52.880]   Had to deal with him. No, and the funny thing is
[01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:56.160]   I think that that that
[01:18:57.280 --> 01:19:03.680]   We don't account enough for how even big titans of technology can become scared
[01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:06.240]   And as long as trump was in office
[01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:12.000]   Uh, look what he tried to do with with with tick with sicktock, right? I think that they were scared of him
[01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:16.240]   Um, and and so january 6th. He was already defeated
[01:19:16.240 --> 01:19:21.200]   And he was leaving office and he did this thing and so it was the moment
[01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:24.000]   When they all could do it
[01:19:24.880 --> 01:19:27.520]   Uh should there are those who said they should have done it a year before
[01:19:27.520 --> 01:19:32.080]   Or should have at least done it from november when he was claiming the big lie from then
[01:19:32.080 --> 01:19:34.800]   But he was still in office and it was
[01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:37.920]   And they were nervous or scared
[01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:40.480]   But golly at that point they were concerned with retaliation, right?
[01:19:40.480 --> 01:19:43.680]   Right that point. Yes, exactly. Oh, we do this with a year left in his term
[01:19:43.680 --> 01:19:47.760]   What is he going to come back with? It's probably not going to be pretty for us. Yeah
[01:19:47.760 --> 01:19:52.320]   So it was it was the accumulation of carbon monoxide in the blood finally got here
[01:19:52.720 --> 01:19:57.840]   So officially and I think it was more about that day, but actually it was more about the accumulation
[01:19:57.840 --> 01:20:00.800]   Okay
[01:20:00.800 --> 01:20:04.080]   Uh
[01:20:04.080 --> 01:20:07.840]   So he says instead of rose buddy goes around muttering kofimi
[01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:14.400]   I do wish I had a facebook account for this this one story
[01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:20.720]   Signal and I I guess I wouldn't have seen these ads because they got immediately turned down my facebook
[01:20:20.720 --> 01:20:26.880]   Actually, there's even a dispute over what happened signal, which is the the uh encrypted messaging platform
[01:20:26.880 --> 01:20:33.040]   a run by open whisper systems and moxie marlin spike the founder trying to run a facebook ad
[01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:37.520]   Gizmodo called it the most honest facebook ad campaign ever created
[01:20:37.520 --> 01:20:41.920]   The ad says you got this ad because and then it says something about you in this
[01:20:41.920 --> 01:20:47.760]   Example case from signal you're a newlywed pilates instructor and your cartoon crazy
[01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:52.480]   This ad used your location to see you're in lahoya and so they're all these examples
[01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:55.280]   Outstanding signal said facebook turned them down
[01:20:55.280 --> 01:21:00.320]   And then canceled their account facebook says no no
[01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:03.280]   Um, we didn't do that
[01:21:03.280 --> 01:21:08.400]   They said this is just a publicity stump by signal who never even tried to actually run these ads
[01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:11.680]   And we didn't shut down their ad account for trying to do so and then signal says
[01:21:11.680 --> 01:21:17.280]   Uh, we absolutely did try to run these the ads were rejected and facebook disabled our ad account
[01:21:17.280 --> 01:21:20.480]   These are real screenshots as facebook should know
[01:21:20.480 --> 01:21:23.120]   So I don't know what really happened
[01:21:23.120 --> 01:21:30.480]   I would trust signal a little more than facebook there's got to be some sort of transaction record out there, right? Yeah, they could show the receipts
[01:21:30.480 --> 01:21:33.520]   Um
[01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:39.760]   I think it's a great idea for an ad of course. It's exactly kind of ad facebook doesn't want anybody to run because it's essentially saying
[01:21:39.760 --> 01:21:46.320]   Well, you see what facebook knows about you and is willing to tell advertisers come to signal stop using facebook messenger because we don't do that
[01:21:47.200 --> 01:21:55.120]   So pretty brilliant. Can you advertise a competitor to facebook on facebook using fit the information facebook provides advertisers?
[01:21:55.120 --> 01:22:00.080]   I would have loved I would love to know I would love to see this ad just to know what facebook knows about me, right?
[01:22:00.080 --> 01:22:01.040]   Yeah
[01:22:01.040 --> 01:22:05.600]   Is that in the terms of service to have ads has probably written somewhere possibly?
[01:22:05.600 --> 01:22:09.120]   Well, I think they could probably say no to anything, but yeah, that's up to i'm curious
[01:22:09.120 --> 01:22:13.200]   The there is a and again. I don't have facebook haven't had it for more than a year
[01:22:13.520 --> 01:22:15.520]   Actually more like two years now
[01:22:15.520 --> 01:22:22.080]   Um, but there used to be a thing you could go see what facebook thinks about you right what think facebook thinks you're a republican and thinks you're this
[01:22:22.080 --> 01:22:23.120]   Well, you can see that
[01:22:23.120 --> 01:22:28.400]   You know was that in facebook was that google? Yeah, no, it's in facebook both facebook. Yeah, i'm wearing on facebook
[01:22:28.400 --> 01:22:31.280]   Uh, I don't know is they still have that. I don't know. I don't know
[01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:37.520]   So that would have been one way to find out but uh, you know, you have to be
[01:22:37.520 --> 01:22:42.640]   So they just simply the idea was they just bought lohoya residents who like long
[01:22:42.640 --> 01:22:50.160]   Lot of individual ads highly to make exposure. Yeah. Yeah, just as every political campaign does
[01:22:50.160 --> 01:22:52.800]   Uh, you know, they bought the targeted ads. Yeah
[01:22:52.800 --> 01:22:55.920]   Um
[01:22:55.920 --> 01:23:00.080]   Facebook is going to give five million dollars to local journalists covering communities
[01:23:00.080 --> 01:23:04.800]   This is a problem. Of course local journalism is dying in a lot of towns
[01:23:05.280 --> 01:23:10.880]   This is part of their and full disclosure is my school might I think do some training for this or something? I don't know but
[01:23:10.880 --> 01:23:17.280]   This is this is part of their journalism product project. I'm not involved. Not really. Yeah, but they're they're trying to
[01:23:17.280 --> 01:23:19.600]   um
[01:23:19.600 --> 01:23:23.840]   We talked about it briefly before but they're trying to create a mechanism and train
[01:23:23.840 --> 01:23:27.680]   Individual journalists, but they're interestingly. It's not just on facebook
[01:23:27.680 --> 01:23:32.720]   They're pursuing people will have blogs off off of facebook and podcasts off of facebook
[01:23:33.040 --> 01:23:40.400]   But use facebook for community and promotion and that facebook is going to try to get some of these going to fill in news deserts giving priority
[01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:42.560]   to people who are covering
[01:23:42.560 --> 01:23:47.200]   Uh areas that don't have major news coverage who come from communities that have not been covered
[01:23:47.200 --> 01:23:50.800]   And so, you know, we'll see what how far five million dollars gets them
[01:23:50.800 --> 01:23:55.040]   I've long believed in the power of hyper local, but it's hard people
[01:23:55.040 --> 01:24:00.160]   It's hard work and people don't make a lot of money doing it and it's hard to find them and to train them
[01:24:00.480 --> 01:24:04.960]   So we'll see how well it goes. I'll try for anything when it comes to local news. Yeah, and I you know
[01:24:04.960 --> 01:24:13.360]   The cynical part of me says oh facebook's a small amount of money and this is a way to kind of revitalize their reputation among journalists
[01:24:13.360 --> 01:24:18.000]   But frankly any corporation that does any kind of giving is doing it
[01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:21.040]   maybe because they believe in the in the in the
[01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:22.880]   you know
[01:24:22.880 --> 01:24:24.720]   Subject but
[01:24:24.720 --> 01:24:29.760]   Just as much because it's good PR. So, you know, yeah, that's no different than anybody else
[01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:36.720]   Enlighten self interest in my interest. It's still is. Yes in my this is a Campbell Brown initiative. Yeah inside facebook
[01:24:36.720 --> 01:24:38.720]   So she's a journalist and wants to see it
[01:24:38.720 --> 01:24:41.280]   Happen and full disclosure
[01:24:41.280 --> 01:24:47.600]   Facebook has given money to my school for various activities when I make no money personally from any of the platforms
[01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:52.560]   Uh fcc has ruled that uh elan musk's
[01:24:52.560 --> 01:24:55.600]   SpaceX satellites can fly even lower
[01:24:56.640 --> 01:25:03.200]   Amazon was a little upset about this initially, but amazon said its concerns were adequately adequately addressed by the conditions the
[01:25:03.200 --> 01:25:08.000]   Commission placed on its approval the fcc authorized SpaceX to lower
[01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.560]   the primary operational altitude for
[01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:13.440]   2,800 four of its satellites
[01:25:13.440 --> 01:25:14.800]   from
[01:25:14.800 --> 01:25:19.840]   1,100 to 1,200 kilometers to about half that 540 to 570 kilometers
[01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:22.560]   Lower
[01:25:22.560 --> 01:25:26.080]   Yes, i'm meaning to ask so like today with that role launch
[01:25:26.800 --> 01:25:30.320]   Is there a map of where these little buggers are so that um
[01:25:30.320 --> 01:25:33.680]   You know that that that is going to be a safe launch
[01:25:33.680 --> 01:25:37.200]   So you don't fly into one of them. Yeah
[01:25:37.200 --> 01:25:41.440]   Well space let me tell you jeff is a very big place
[01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:46.400]   There's more and more stuff up there, right? How do they do that john?
[01:25:46.400 --> 01:25:50.240]   It's all mapped. They know where it's stuff is going to be
[01:25:51.840 --> 01:25:57.840]   You can uh you can actually go to a live picture of the satellites right now and i guess they just plan the launch
[01:25:57.840 --> 01:26:03.760]   It might get more complicated because you know things like the mars launch the window for that is is fairly short
[01:26:03.760 --> 01:26:08.240]   And if you miss it, you might have to wait a year till the next time you can launch to mars
[01:26:08.240 --> 01:26:09.920]   Do you want to do it when it's closest?
[01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:16.000]   Uh, and so it may be that you don't have a whole lot of time to get around the satellites, but you know they're moving around and i yeah
[01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:18.960]   There is some concern
[01:26:18.960 --> 01:26:21.280]   That uh with there you go
[01:26:22.080 --> 01:26:23.760]   Oh, holy
[01:26:23.760 --> 01:26:26.400]   Where's where's that from john is that google says google
[01:26:26.400 --> 01:26:30.160]   Look at that
[01:26:30.160 --> 01:26:32.160]   They're all but you see that line
[01:26:32.160 --> 01:26:38.480]   You get a john a mic
[01:26:38.480 --> 01:26:42.560]   He's talking about that line above
[01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:45.920]   Go go go go up that orange line across
[01:26:45.920 --> 01:26:48.400]   Is that a that's see
[01:26:48.400 --> 01:26:52.320]   Everybody gets on the mic there that those are all star links
[01:26:52.320 --> 01:26:59.600]   The recent launch and they haven't deployed their positions. Yeah. Yeah, okay. Thank you
[01:26:59.600 --> 01:27:06.320]   So they get you know they launched from one rocket 60 or more satellites at once and then and then they have to fly in a position
[01:27:06.320 --> 01:27:09.440]   So yeah, wow, look at that. Geez. There's a lot of them up there
[01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:14.960]   But yeah, no kidding. There's hundreds and hundreds of miles between each one, you know, i mean, it's you know, but
[01:27:16.080 --> 01:27:19.360]   You know, i'd finally get on the rocket ship just my odds
[01:27:19.360 --> 01:27:23.840]   Talk so you're saying those a chance
[01:27:23.840 --> 01:27:29.200]   We're gonna have to turn around and go home. Yeah
[01:27:29.200 --> 01:27:36.560]   So i'm the guy who paid for skylab, you know, so
[01:27:36.560 --> 01:27:40.720]   Yeah, he bought pizza for all of australia. What was the story?
[01:27:41.680 --> 01:27:46.640]   10,000 bucks for a beer haul or as helper bringing us the first pieces of skylab
[01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:50.400]   Stan Thornton so i didn't know that nuzzle
[01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:54.080]   You know, it's a real meeting people said on twitter bought nuzzle
[01:27:54.080 --> 01:27:58.240]   And i said what i didn't know that nuzzle got sold to scroll
[01:27:58.240 --> 01:28:01.840]   Yes, two years ago kind of rescued rescued
[01:28:01.840 --> 01:28:06.180]   Scroll which is this actually very interesting company
[01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:13.520]   Scroll one of the things scroll is doing and i'm a subscriber to this is you pay five bucks a month and they distributed. Oh, you got it
[01:28:13.520 --> 01:28:15.040]   Yeah
[01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:22.160]   They distribute it to partner sites as you're browsing around so scroll is proven they say there's a new model for journalism
[01:28:22.160 --> 01:28:26.640]   40 more revenue 28 more time spent 15 percent increase in page views
[01:28:26.640 --> 01:28:29.680]   twitter just bought scroll
[01:28:29.680 --> 01:28:32.480]   And getting nuzzle in the process i might add
[01:28:32.480 --> 01:28:37.200]   Which i think is interesting they're gonna shut down nuzzle, which is too bad because i love nuzzle
[01:28:37.840 --> 01:28:40.160]   For now, but i get the feeling
[01:28:40.160 --> 01:28:46.960]   That they might be planning something because remember they have also bought that newsletter business a few months ago
[01:28:46.960 --> 01:28:53.440]   Right exactly and and and so tony hale who's the founder of scroll who prior to that was the the head of chart beat
[01:28:53.440 --> 01:28:55.360]   That's tony hale. I know tony hale
[01:28:55.360 --> 01:28:56.480]   Tony's great
[01:28:56.480 --> 01:29:00.800]   Tony's a friend and tony believes deeply in journalism and and in in the case of scroll
[01:29:00.800 --> 01:29:04.560]   He was just saying there's some before it's not everybody is not gonna save everything
[01:29:04.800 --> 01:29:09.200]   But there's some proportion of your audience who would pay money every month to get rid of me ads
[01:29:09.200 --> 01:29:11.360]   Yeah, and you capture them right? Yeah
[01:29:11.360 --> 01:29:14.960]   And and and they're using and they're feeling guilty is a damn well showed about using
[01:29:14.960 --> 01:29:19.840]   um ad blockers and stuff and they get a better experience anyway, it's not not clued
[01:29:19.840 --> 01:29:21.840]   And so he set that up
[01:29:21.840 --> 01:29:27.040]   But what he said was that the twitter is the one he said from facebook and google news is come c come saw
[01:29:27.040 --> 01:29:33.440]   It's not really part of their strategy if it went away it wouldn't hurt them twitter is the one company for which news is
[01:29:33.600 --> 01:29:36.960]   critical to its strategy. So he believed this was a core
[01:29:36.960 --> 01:29:45.040]   Marriage meant to happen and and I think it shows I mean I'm really getting every day. I get more to be more a fan of jackporsey
[01:29:45.040 --> 01:29:51.120]   Uh considering how he handled trump considering how he's buying this stuff and starting to do things. He cares about news
[01:29:51.120 --> 01:29:52.720]   um
[01:29:52.720 --> 01:30:00.720]   He cares about expertise. I think there's interesting stuff happening on twitter and so by getting scroll in and nuzzle
[01:30:01.840 --> 01:30:06.240]   you know, well and nuzzle has a newsletter kind of a component because
[01:30:06.240 --> 01:30:11.040]   Uh, so what nuzzle is is a news site that is based on your twitter
[01:30:11.040 --> 01:30:16.240]   Feed so you sign links from the links that people link to
[01:30:16.240 --> 01:30:20.080]   Right. It's no sign in with your twitter feed and then it shows you
[01:30:20.080 --> 01:30:25.120]   shows uh news from your friends news from your friends of friends
[01:30:25.120 --> 01:30:28.000]   News you may have missed because none of your friends link to it
[01:30:28.640 --> 01:30:33.040]   And uh, I found it to be very useful. It's not it's not I don't use it just for tech
[01:30:33.040 --> 01:30:40.640]   Has apparently based on the people i'm following their very interesting politics as well. So it would be that will look different for
[01:30:40.640 --> 01:30:42.880]   Everybody I would guess
[01:30:42.880 --> 01:30:46.240]   But imagine if you can have a different view of twitter where you don't just see the tweets
[01:30:46.240 --> 01:30:48.880]   You see the nuzzle view of your twitter feed
[01:30:48.880 --> 01:30:53.280]   Which is what are the interesting stories in twitter more and more ones is forcing you to read those stories before you
[01:30:53.280 --> 01:30:55.360]   You know, you know, you're doing anything with them, right? Yeah
[01:30:55.360 --> 01:30:59.440]   So so that becomes an interesting way to do it imagine too if you can have a one sign in
[01:30:59.440 --> 01:31:04.240]   View then across premium news sites from twitter
[01:31:04.240 --> 01:31:09.680]   And your site you're subscribing to twitter and to tons of good news sites
[01:31:09.680 --> 01:31:12.400]   That starts to be really interesting
[01:31:12.400 --> 01:31:20.720]   So then are are you thinking like with with this kind of in combination with you know the the word that we've heard that twitter is working on
[01:31:20.800 --> 01:31:26.560]   Some sort of a premium model like this kind of ties into that right or does right?
[01:31:26.560 --> 01:31:28.080]   I would imagine
[01:31:28.080 --> 01:31:34.960]   This would be a component of whatever their premium model would be because when when i've thought about twitter as a premium model prior
[01:31:34.960 --> 01:31:41.280]   It was kind of like well, what could you really do to the twitter experience that I would actually pay for but that's a lot of added value there
[01:31:41.280 --> 01:31:44.080]   I would absolutely pay for that and actually when I think about it
[01:31:44.080 --> 01:31:47.120]   And I mentioned this last night on all about android as well
[01:31:47.360 --> 01:31:50.720]   There aren't a whole lot of services that I use as much as I use twitter
[01:31:50.720 --> 01:31:53.120]   So if it really came down to paying for something
[01:31:53.120 --> 01:31:58.320]   I would have to put my money where my mouth is I use twitter pretty pretty constantly
[01:31:58.320 --> 01:32:03.600]   I should be able to um to you know pitch a podium pay for the sauce
[01:32:03.600 --> 01:32:05.920]   But I but I think that that you know
[01:32:05.920 --> 01:32:12.800]   Part of the problem Jason is that it's hard to say what would be premium on top of yeah twitter has to have a free layer or else
[01:32:13.040 --> 01:32:17.280]   It's because it's it's it's stock just went down because it's user growth
[01:32:17.280 --> 01:32:19.200]   stalled a bit
[01:32:19.200 --> 01:32:20.080]   though
[01:32:20.080 --> 01:32:22.160]   Investors are buying the stock at the same time
[01:32:22.160 --> 01:32:23.440]   um
[01:32:23.440 --> 01:32:27.200]   So you don't necessarily you either charge for the core thing and shrink it
[01:32:27.200 --> 01:32:34.240]   Or you cope with something new and so coming up with something and this this goes to your thing and to the other day is
[01:32:34.240 --> 01:32:37.120]   You didn't really want to commit to
[01:32:37.120 --> 01:32:39.440]   Subscribing to the washington post
[01:32:39.440 --> 01:32:41.600]   You did because we kind of brought you into it
[01:32:42.240 --> 01:32:46.800]   And i'm but if you're not just going to get out of that trial because it hasn't really added any value
[01:32:46.800 --> 01:32:48.960]   uh to my day-to-day consumption
[01:32:48.960 --> 01:32:53.280]   But if you could get the occasional article from 20 different places that had value
[01:32:53.280 --> 01:32:56.320]   Without friction would you pay for that?
[01:32:56.320 --> 01:32:58.880]   That's a different story. All right
[01:32:58.880 --> 01:33:04.240]   Uh and you could imagine through the nuzzle functionality getting links
[01:33:04.240 --> 01:33:07.440]   I mean it could be it could be a hell of a draw a driver
[01:33:07.440 --> 01:33:09.200]   of
[01:33:09.200 --> 01:33:10.480]   subscription
[01:33:10.480 --> 01:33:12.480]   One definition or another
[01:33:12.480 --> 01:33:16.720]   To this there's another company called uh x
[01:33:16.720 --> 01:33:19.280]   Oh, should i forget what it is x eight? No
[01:33:19.280 --> 01:33:23.760]   Uh, there's another company out there that does some interesting things in this model where where you
[01:33:23.760 --> 01:33:29.600]   Um pay a lump sum in the month and you can choose when to use it. There's a few different models
[01:33:29.600 --> 01:33:35.920]   By the way, we should give a a plug here to the amazing wonderful jonathan aprons
[01:33:35.920 --> 01:33:39.360]   Yes, who was the founder of nuzzle? Yes
[01:33:39.920 --> 01:33:42.880]   Also, of course the founder of friend's juror and hot legs before that
[01:33:42.880 --> 01:33:48.400]   Jonathan's one of those great unsung people who really is always just a little bit too ahead of the world
[01:33:48.400 --> 01:33:53.920]   But that's great. Yeah, I love nuzzle. I use it. I will be sad to lose it. Frankly
[01:33:53.920 --> 01:33:55.840]   I enjoyed using it. I had a
[01:33:55.840 --> 01:33:59.680]   couple opportunities to co-host tech news weekly with mr
[01:33:59.680 --> 01:34:00.400]   Howl and mr
[01:34:00.400 --> 01:34:01.760]   sergeant and
[01:34:01.760 --> 01:34:06.640]   And it was nice to be able to pull that up and take a look at my followers that I know
[01:34:07.280 --> 01:34:10.400]   Pay attention to some things that I typically don't pay attention to
[01:34:10.400 --> 01:34:14.400]   And be able to grab some interesting insight now granted
[01:34:14.400 --> 01:34:18.400]   October and november was a pain in the butt because it was all political stuff
[01:34:18.400 --> 01:34:24.240]   But outside of that it was it was a great resource for some stuff that I had no idea what's going on out there
[01:34:24.240 --> 01:34:29.520]   And and trust it are screaming about losing nuzzle. They're just
[01:34:29.520 --> 01:34:35.920]   It was trusted sources to you know, really. Yeah. I mean, it's a great. It's a great tool for for journalism. Yeah
[01:34:36.560 --> 01:34:38.560]   Absolutely. I wonder if
[01:34:38.560 --> 01:34:44.080]   Twitter might not have liked it because it honestly I used it more than I use twitter
[01:34:44.080 --> 01:34:47.520]   I used it to scrape my twitter and I only read nuzzle
[01:34:47.520 --> 01:34:53.200]   Uh, I wonder if that twitter would i'm sure twitter would free you go to the twitter page
[01:34:53.200 --> 01:34:54.960]   Unless they know
[01:34:54.960 --> 01:34:58.800]   To fix twitter then if that's the case because I went to twitter first
[01:34:58.800 --> 01:35:01.680]   I've said before that twitter is where I got my
[01:35:02.160 --> 01:35:06.080]   News but again, if I was working tech news weekly that week
[01:35:06.080 --> 01:35:11.200]   I wanted to get a little bit more than what I normally would get because I don't particularly care about
[01:35:11.200 --> 01:35:16.000]   News the way other people do and when I go to my version of twitter
[01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:22.880]   It's it's enough news in there for ant prove it but not enough for you know, you or mr. Jarvis or what have you so
[01:35:22.880 --> 01:35:29.440]   Having nuzzle step in and say okay ant you need to know more about this stuff right here too not just because your buddy
[01:35:29.440 --> 01:35:31.120]   um posted it
[01:35:31.120 --> 01:35:35.520]   But your buddy posted it his friend posted it her friend posted it
[01:35:35.520 --> 01:35:40.880]   It's so it's pretty important to take a look at it and and I like that about nuzzle twitter didn't really give me that
[01:35:40.880 --> 01:35:43.520]   Well for for me the difference
[01:35:43.520 --> 01:35:47.120]   As i'm listening to you kind of talk through this it kind of it
[01:35:47.120 --> 01:35:54.640]   Suddenly became clear to me the thing that I appreciate about nuzzle compared to an algorithm is the algorithm
[01:35:54.640 --> 01:35:59.040]   On a twitter site that says this is news that you would care about is very anonymous
[01:35:59.120 --> 01:36:03.200]   It's very much just like we think you care about this are we right here is
[01:36:03.200 --> 01:36:07.920]   Are you gonna read it on nuzzle it was it was a very transparent
[01:36:07.920 --> 01:36:13.680]   Approach to saying we think you're gonna care about this because all these people that you care about care about it
[01:36:13.680 --> 01:36:21.120]   And being able to to read to open up a news story and see all the people that I respect enough to follow on twitter
[01:36:21.120 --> 01:36:24.960]   Commenting you know about their views and their takes on these stories
[01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:30.320]   It was just the the contextual kind of bonus out of that was just so much more
[01:36:30.320 --> 01:36:36.720]   Satisfying to me then just going on a site and taking what it says it thinks I want to read
[01:36:36.720 --> 01:36:39.120]   Jason, I think you're so right
[01:36:39.120 --> 01:36:42.080]   Uh, and I was talking to somebody else about a different business this morning
[01:36:42.080 --> 01:36:48.480]   They were just calling for advice and I've been arguing that I think the next generation of the web is an expert player
[01:36:48.480 --> 01:36:54.560]   And uh, you know, I've talked to offer the show about my my covid twitter list of 600 experts
[01:36:54.560 --> 01:36:56.560]   And how much it's taught me
[01:36:56.560 --> 01:36:59.520]   And and twitter has been trying to build those expert lists
[01:36:59.520 --> 01:37:03.200]   Their covid player list frankly isn't as good as mine because they have a few turkeys on it
[01:37:03.200 --> 01:37:04.800]   Um
[01:37:04.800 --> 01:37:06.800]   And and so you can see where
[01:37:06.800 --> 01:37:12.080]   A nuzzle slash scroll scroll for the big brands nuzzle for the kind of individuals
[01:37:12.080 --> 01:37:17.520]   Could start to bring you an entirely different window onto twitter and now remember again jack strategy
[01:37:17.520 --> 01:37:22.560]   Of looking at the possibility of a federated open lower layer of twitter
[01:37:23.200 --> 01:37:27.840]   Then the money is made like wordpress with the value you add on top of that layer
[01:37:27.840 --> 01:37:34.480]   The recommendations you give the curation you do the the subscription models you you offer
[01:37:34.480 --> 01:37:38.080]   Um, uh, the relationships you you you enable
[01:37:38.080 --> 01:37:41.520]   Uh in social there's a huge new opportunity on top of that
[01:37:41.520 --> 01:37:43.840]   But I think it becomes based in
[01:37:43.840 --> 01:37:48.880]   The people you trust the people who are experts now that can also mean you trust the wrong people and
[01:37:48.880 --> 01:37:51.760]   Idiots feed idiots, but that's the world
[01:37:52.720 --> 01:37:54.720]   So we'll see
[01:37:54.720 --> 01:37:58.160]   Uh
[01:37:58.160 --> 01:38:01.840]   There's so many stories I want to talk about but I also
[01:38:01.840 --> 01:38:05.200]   We're kind of running out of time
[01:38:05.200 --> 01:38:11.840]   Time time time time time tell me what the time is Leo. That's wrong. It's not
[01:38:11.840 --> 01:38:14.800]   2017
[01:38:14.800 --> 01:38:18.720]   Why what a good a new clock was Leo shut up
[01:38:20.080 --> 01:38:23.920]   I got a new clock and I have to set it. It's a nixie clock
[01:38:23.920 --> 01:38:24.960]   It's actually a very cool clock
[01:38:24.960 --> 01:38:30.400]   But if for some reason at two o'clock it went back to one o'clock and now it syncs his two o'clock again
[01:38:30.400 --> 01:38:34.960]   So let's see, you know, I see that three o'clock if it goes back to one o'clock. I don't know what's going on
[01:38:34.960 --> 01:38:37.760]   It's actually a time machine Leo. Maybe that's it
[01:38:37.760 --> 01:38:47.040]   Um, about dog day in the podcast. Yeah, it really is that time over and over and over again
[01:38:48.720 --> 01:38:55.280]   New york requiring 15 broadband for poor people immediately sued by all the big isp saying what are you nuts?
[01:38:55.280 --> 01:38:58.480]   There's no money in that
[01:38:58.480 --> 01:39:06.160]   Why people don't get more why they don't stay angrier at their cable company and internet company versus the platforms
[01:39:06.160 --> 01:39:09.520]   Pros me. Yeah, that forms give you wonderful freeze stop. Yeah
[01:39:09.520 --> 01:39:12.480]   You're getting ripped off by your
[01:39:12.480 --> 01:39:14.800]   Yeah, yeah
[01:39:14.800 --> 01:39:21.280]   I don't get it lobbying groups for Verizon 18 t and other isp's went to court to overturn the
[01:39:21.280 --> 01:39:24.880]   state law. What a surprise Verizon and att you say
[01:39:24.880 --> 01:39:27.760]   Where's cum casting that I bet they're in there too
[01:39:27.760 --> 01:39:31.040]   Of course they are uh, let's see
[01:39:31.040 --> 01:39:34.160]   Google is rising. Yes
[01:39:34.160 --> 01:39:40.880]   Um, we talked about this last week briefly, but they now yeah, who yeah, yeah, yeah, where they get loaded them
[01:39:41.760 --> 01:39:45.760]   Five billion supposed to is a yeah to Apollo global management
[01:39:45.760 --> 01:39:48.960]   Why are all these private equity firms? Why do they have such?
[01:39:48.960 --> 01:39:56.240]   Anodyne names like this well cuz they're they don't want you to know what they're up to the devil where is a uh, yeah
[01:39:56.240 --> 01:40:00.400]   Nice Apollo global management. What could be wrong with that?
[01:40:00.400 --> 01:40:05.760]   The news becoming the final the newspapers is all didn't management right? No, it was a meme. Yeah, nothing
[01:40:05.760 --> 01:40:11.200]   Is there a guy named Apollo running it? I don't think so would have been better if they called himself zeus
[01:40:11.600 --> 01:40:13.600]   Yeah, zeus
[01:40:13.600 --> 01:40:15.600]   You should know what you were getting into right?
[01:40:15.600 --> 01:40:18.560]   Yeah
[01:40:18.560 --> 01:40:24.880]   Uh, so Verizon medium media which has gone through several names will be renamed yet again
[01:40:24.880 --> 01:40:28.240]   Uh to yahoo
[01:40:28.240 --> 01:40:33.200]   Isn't that funny so they bought yahoo renamed it osu was that osu?
[01:40:33.200 --> 01:40:39.120]   That's great and then and then they got rid of osu and called it Verizon media and now let's go back to yahoo
[01:40:39.760 --> 01:40:41.760]   Oh my goodness. Yeah
[01:40:41.760 --> 01:40:43.600]   But it isn't all of yahoo
[01:40:43.600 --> 01:40:48.960]   So we were talking about this on sunday and the speculation was that they they bought parts of it
[01:40:48.960 --> 01:40:53.360]   But maybe not intellectual property and things like the advertising technology business. So
[01:40:53.360 --> 01:40:59.280]   I don't know we'll see we'll see we'll see five billion is a lot less than they paid for
[01:40:59.280 --> 01:41:01.360]   the
[01:41:01.360 --> 01:41:09.120]   various parts and pieces to about half of what they paid for yeah, it is a fraction of what their market cap was some kind of a
[01:41:09.360 --> 01:41:12.960]   Couldn't have happened. Oh a nicer bunch of people. Yeah, I hated yahoo male
[01:41:12.960 --> 01:41:18.960]   But I used to love yahoo sports and yahoo games back in the days. Yeah, yeah
[01:41:18.960 --> 01:41:23.360]   Yeah, this was the front page of the internet. It was huge
[01:41:23.360 --> 01:41:27.600]   My yahoo and others. I mean yahoo the tv
[01:41:27.600 --> 01:41:35.760]   Yahoo which I think was tv.com had more views than almost any other site on the internet. I mean it was really really huge
[01:41:35.760 --> 01:41:38.080]   You still love it. Yeah
[01:41:39.040 --> 01:41:41.040]   Um
[01:41:41.040 --> 01:41:44.640]   Good new yorker article. I'll just get through you a tip on a
[01:41:44.640 --> 01:41:52.160]   Probably the greatest simpsons writer of all time who has never ever done a media interview
[01:41:52.160 --> 01:41:57.120]   Uh, rarely profiled. He's very uh private
[01:41:57.120 --> 01:42:02.320]   But um, I started reading it and it's very good. So I recommend that
[01:42:03.600 --> 01:42:09.920]   We the classy show we're classy the simpsons. I mean, another one in there. So classy. Let's talk about the simpsons
[01:42:09.920 --> 01:42:12.000]   john Schwartz
[01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:15.520]   Welder Schwartz world the sage of the simpsons
[01:42:15.520 --> 01:42:20.160]   First major interview one of the one of the most revered comedy writers of all time
[01:42:20.160 --> 01:42:23.360]   If you're a simpsons fan, it's his
[01:42:23.360 --> 01:42:29.920]   A monster gonna make a confession. Yes as a former tv critic never watched the simpsons. Don't tell me that never
[01:42:31.600 --> 01:42:33.600]   Later late in the later years not good
[01:42:33.600 --> 01:42:37.680]   But in the early years really ground breaking
[01:42:37.680 --> 01:42:44.400]   I used to love it. I just yeah, I thought I missed I used to love him, but then I later boycotted the simpsons
[01:42:44.400 --> 01:42:46.720]   Why did you boycott?
[01:42:46.720 --> 01:42:49.680]   Uh, lisa simpson got a letter in the mail
[01:42:49.680 --> 01:42:52.320]   um from the
[01:42:52.320 --> 01:42:55.440]   Quote best state university in south carolina
[01:42:55.440 --> 01:42:58.480]   In homo simpsons says go gamecocks
[01:42:59.520 --> 01:43:03.840]   Now it's done. You know, it's a you know, it's a cartoon right? I mean, it's not I don't care
[01:43:03.840 --> 01:43:07.680]   I don't have done with you
[01:43:07.680 --> 01:43:11.760]   I haven't watched him since
[01:43:11.760 --> 01:43:22.480]   There was another new york article you were about to mention well just just because it's interesting um they
[01:43:22.480 --> 01:43:26.720]   And this is you know, we see these kind of ai stories before but they they
[01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:31.600]   It keeps on advancing and they took known writers
[01:43:31.600 --> 01:43:36.480]   And then had it kind of continue on in their style and it did amazingly
[01:43:36.480 --> 01:43:39.360]   And what it says to me is that is writing
[01:43:39.360 --> 01:43:42.000]   since montenia
[01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:45.280]   That was the kind of the entry point you had to have in the conversation
[01:43:45.280 --> 01:43:48.880]   Oh, you're a writer if you're not a writer people aren't going to read you and listen to you right?
[01:43:48.880 --> 01:43:52.880]   so writing became the the requirement for an elite
[01:43:52.880 --> 01:43:54.800]   and
[01:43:54.800 --> 01:43:55.600]   Now
[01:43:55.600 --> 01:43:58.800]   It is writing everywhere right everybody's got their hot takes out there
[01:43:58.800 --> 01:44:03.200]   Everybody's got their blogs everybody's got it out there and now the machines will be able to do it
[01:44:03.200 --> 01:44:07.840]   Incredible ways to they've been doing it of course for sports stories and finniet stories, which are how they structured
[01:44:07.840 --> 01:44:10.320]   But now they're even doing it to a level of art
[01:44:10.320 --> 01:44:15.600]   And writing is commodified writing is not a special thing anymore writing is not a big deal folks
[01:44:15.600 --> 01:44:21.040]   They proved as a writer they proved it and i'm kind of spoiling the article by
[01:44:21.040 --> 01:44:23.680]   giving you the first paragraph of
[01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:28.960]   Gregor Kafka's famous book the metamorphosis and then giving you the second paragraph
[01:44:28.960 --> 01:44:31.360]   Which as far as you can tell
[01:44:31.360 --> 01:44:33.760]   seems pretty
[01:44:33.760 --> 01:44:37.520]   Right on and then they say except that that was written by an ai
[01:44:37.520 --> 01:44:40.960]   This is gpt3. We've talked about it before
[01:44:40.960 --> 01:44:44.400]   Right, uh the open ai neural learning
[01:44:44.400 --> 01:44:50.320]   Network that can auto generate text. It wasn't very good in the first few iterations
[01:44:50.320 --> 01:44:53.040]   It's getting better keeps getting better
[01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:57.120]   So yeah, it's clearly only a matter of time before it will be
[01:44:57.120 --> 01:45:04.560]   You know the deep fake of writing it'll be indistinguishable from uh from the real thing gary vaynerchuk quoted on cnn
[01:45:04.560 --> 01:45:09.440]   Nft is the next amazon
[01:45:09.440 --> 01:45:12.800]   No, you're wrong gary
[01:45:12.800 --> 01:45:18.000]   You're wrong. You're just wrong. Well, see have this amazing. Oh, what if he's right?
[01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:20.640]   No, but he's not what does it even mean?
[01:45:22.080 --> 01:45:26.000]   I don't know guess what gary v has his own nft collection
[01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:33.680]   Which gives buyers three years of access to his vcon business good well named vcon and marketing convention
[01:45:33.680 --> 01:45:37.680]   Customers can buy the tokens with ethereum cryptocurrency
[01:45:37.680 --> 01:45:40.800]   What a surprise
[01:45:40.800 --> 01:45:48.720]   I like you know what gary's an old friend but i'm same here the hype machine has as a venture got to just wind down a little bit
[01:45:51.520 --> 01:45:54.080]   the thing at my at at this point I hear
[01:45:54.080 --> 01:46:04.960]   People like him say that about nft's and it makes me think back to my first thoughts of bitcoin and dogecoin and and how i'm kicking myself
[01:46:04.960 --> 01:46:10.720]   Well, you know, it's really kicking himself the guy who co-created dogecoin
[01:46:10.720 --> 01:46:12.400]   No kidding
[01:46:12.400 --> 01:46:20.240]   Uh dogecoin which hit 45 cents on monday night, which means it is now bigger than honda motor company
[01:46:20.640 --> 01:46:22.960]   in terms of market cap except
[01:46:22.960 --> 01:46:28.640]   The guy who created what was basically a joke cryptocurrency billy mark us
[01:46:28.640 --> 01:46:34.800]   Recent revealed that he sold off all his dogecoin in 2015
[01:46:34.800 --> 01:46:40.320]   For an amount equivalent to what he used honda civic would cost at that
[01:46:40.320 --> 01:46:48.320]   $10,000 he used it to pay rent not by a honda civic, but it's now worth more than all of honda company
[01:46:48.960 --> 01:47:00.640]   It's a crazy world we got in here on a crazy world. It's a crazy world. Yeah, there's always been that you know, they're gonna steal it
[01:47:00.640 --> 01:47:06.400]   Oh, there's always been that stuff. It's not it's 66. Okay. Yeah, 66 right now
[01:47:06.400 --> 01:47:14.080]   Wow, the the the meme has been pushing for a dollar for i don't know how many months now and it seemed crazy
[01:47:14.080 --> 01:47:18.240]   About about five months ago, you know, it's all like a ridiculous thought and now we're close
[01:47:18.400 --> 01:47:22.000]   Father robert balisare who when he was doing know how
[01:47:22.000 --> 01:47:25.600]   Set up a dogecoin miner as a joke
[01:47:25.600 --> 01:47:30.160]   Mine how many millions 1.2 million no no
[01:47:30.160 --> 01:47:33.760]   john saying 20 million
[01:47:33.760 --> 01:47:38.960]   I don't know about that was only one checked i checked i checked him with him yesterday
[01:47:38.960 --> 01:47:44.240]   About it said so how many how many millions did you have and i think he said 1.2 unless i misread that
[01:47:44.240 --> 01:47:47.840]   But regard no matter how you slice it close enough
[01:47:48.400 --> 01:47:53.840]   What is 69? What is 69 cents time to 1.2. It's not a million bucks. Let's face it
[01:47:53.840 --> 01:47:57.360]   It's always you can buy the vatican. It's only a lot of cash
[01:47:57.360 --> 01:48:00.160]   700,000 it's not like you know
[01:48:00.160 --> 01:48:04.640]   Still a lot of cash dogecoin has done 20
[01:48:04.640 --> 01:48:09.600]   I'm sorry 42 billion dollars in volume in the last 24 hours
[01:48:09.600 --> 01:48:11.920]   Wow
[01:48:11.920 --> 01:48:13.920]   Whatever happened to my dogecoin wallet
[01:48:15.120 --> 01:48:18.000]   I invested it in this fine nixie cloth
[01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:21.760]   That's wrong
[01:48:21.760 --> 01:48:28.000]   I haven't said it yet. Well, I did but you did said it you did that's the thing
[01:48:28.000 --> 01:48:30.320]   He spent an hour and a half to set it
[01:48:30.320 --> 01:48:35.920]   No, I had to carefully wipe down every tube with alcohol wearing gloves
[01:48:35.920 --> 01:48:42.160]   And slowly very very slowly insert the tubes into the pins
[01:48:42.560 --> 01:48:45.520]   It was like watching missing missing impossible on the pre-show
[01:48:45.520 --> 01:48:52.480]   They come around from the pre-show. You don't want to miss this fun. I'm telling you
[01:48:52.480 --> 01:49:09.760]   Sony ditches DSLRs moving beyond film era designs. What does that mean at prut? Yeah, prut
[01:49:10.800 --> 01:49:13.760]   I'm sorry. My heart had just messaged me what
[01:49:13.760 --> 01:49:20.640]   I didn't know Sony made DSLRs. I thought they were all mirrorless way back in the day
[01:49:20.640 --> 01:49:25.440]   But they stopped now completely they apparently were still making them, but they were no longer
[01:49:25.440 --> 01:49:29.280]   Yeah, right when they got into that nx any x line
[01:49:29.280 --> 01:49:36.320]   Just smaller compact system cameras. It really started to take off and then you started to see the a7 line now for
[01:49:36.880 --> 01:49:40.800]   a7. Yeah, that's what I asked. Yeah, yeah, you have a7r
[01:49:40.800 --> 01:49:49.120]   Their prowess really just took off especially on the video standpoint because it was so lightweight and the color science is really good
[01:49:49.120 --> 01:49:52.320]   And it just been getting better and better and better
[01:49:52.320 --> 01:49:53.920]   and
[01:49:53.920 --> 01:49:59.120]   Why not just just stick to with what's working? You know, and they also had a mirror is dying of cameras
[01:49:59.120 --> 01:50:03.840]   Pardon the mirrors die at some point because that whole technology go away
[01:50:04.960 --> 01:50:11.840]   Yeah, it's pretty much a dead a dead tech everybody's moving more towards the mirrorless design because it's a lot more
[01:50:11.840 --> 01:50:18.960]   No, I shouldn't say this. I shouldn't say a lot more because it's lighter than the DSLR body
[01:50:18.960 --> 01:50:21.600]   because if you look at the
[01:50:21.600 --> 01:50:23.200]   r5
[01:50:23.200 --> 01:50:24.480]   and this
[01:50:24.480 --> 01:50:26.720]   A1 that I just reviewed for hands-on tech
[01:50:26.720 --> 01:50:32.720]   They're fairly light bodies, but when you put a lens on them, these things are still just as heavy as a DSLR
[01:50:32.800 --> 01:50:37.760]   It's just this a smaller compact body that's a little bit more manageable to carry around
[01:50:37.760 --> 01:50:46.560]   While we're on photo can we can I get and you're just your explanation of how the bidens look like giants and the carters
[01:50:46.560 --> 01:50:52.160]   Lens choice
[01:50:52.160 --> 01:51:00.800]   You use a wide angle lens you get lens distortion and they tend to make things sort of bow out
[01:51:01.360 --> 01:51:03.360]   If you use software like Lightroom
[01:51:03.360 --> 01:51:10.960]   Lightroom has a calibration feature that will help flatten your image out to make things look a little bit more natural
[01:51:10.960 --> 01:51:17.440]   They're on the same plane. I don't think I think they the bidens actually are giants and they and the carters are
[01:51:17.440 --> 01:51:25.840]   That is not they're on the same focal plane. There is no that's no lens issue
[01:51:25.840 --> 01:51:30.160]   What I saw it looked like they were down lower that okay. Yeah, that does look weird
[01:51:31.120 --> 01:51:33.120]   Oh boy, it's just amazing
[01:51:33.120 --> 01:51:39.520]   It looks like they've gone to visit a home for munchkins boy and uh
[01:51:39.520 --> 01:51:42.400]   But you do get smaller when you get older
[01:51:42.400 --> 01:51:49.440]   See how one of the I means now because if he was using say like a
[01:51:49.440 --> 01:51:56.080]   85 or something it would be a lot more compressed there. I don't know does that make any sense? I know
[01:51:56.640 --> 01:52:03.040]   I know there's there's something about how the carters are sitting and the fact that the angle that we're seeing them
[01:52:03.040 --> 01:52:05.760]   We're seeing the top of their legs as if it's a small
[01:52:05.760 --> 01:52:12.560]   Distant. Yeah, I think the president is actually uh kind of maybe is a foot or two ahead of Roslyn
[01:52:12.560 --> 01:52:18.480]   But I and I don't know maybe Jimmy's just that small because it looks like Jill Biden is exactly next to him
[01:52:18.480 --> 01:52:20.960]   Yeah
[01:52:20.960 --> 01:52:25.200]   Yeah, I don't know if you mentioned as you know what you're not alone the guardian
[01:52:26.240 --> 01:52:28.880]   Photo editor said the image is possibly deserted by using a
[01:52:28.880 --> 01:52:32.240]   Wide-angle lens and I'm sure that that's true
[01:52:32.240 --> 01:52:39.200]   It maybe it was so wide that even the small distance between them was enough to create that kind of strange
[01:52:39.200 --> 01:52:47.920]   It was so fun watching twitter if you take your if you take your smartphone and want to take a selfie or of yourself or whatever
[01:52:47.920 --> 01:52:53.120]   And the closer you put it you will start to notice like your nose would get yeah, you know
[01:52:53.120 --> 01:52:59.920]   And that's just the distortion of the lens. It's the same principle here, but I don't know this looks a little walking
[01:52:59.920 --> 01:53:05.920]   I'm thinking it was like a I'm thinking he was shooting with like a 16-mill or something like that
[01:53:05.920 --> 01:53:07.920]   This something is really really wide
[01:53:07.920 --> 01:53:09.280]   um
[01:53:09.280 --> 01:53:10.160]   And
[01:53:10.160 --> 01:53:14.480]   Went and got it into post and tried to compress it down and you ended still ended up with this
[01:53:14.480 --> 01:53:19.920]   Might have happened in post you're saying right so probably still should have shot with like a 35 prime
[01:53:21.280 --> 01:53:23.280]   Yeah, yeah
[01:53:23.280 --> 01:53:26.720]   My favorite part too is built which is the kind of tabloid of germany
[01:53:26.720 --> 01:53:32.880]   Uh ran the picture of the big headline on page on the on the front page saying leave like their haban di cares geschrift
[01:53:32.880 --> 01:53:35.600]   Honey we've shrunk the carters
[01:53:35.600 --> 01:53:47.440]   Actually, it's worth reading the guardian article because they also include a lot of other famous
[01:53:47.440 --> 01:53:48.640]   uh
[01:53:48.640 --> 01:53:50.640]   viral photos
[01:53:50.720 --> 01:53:56.160]   What scooter is put in the chat is hilarious too. He says the carters what he say are
[01:53:56.160 --> 01:53:59.840]   I mean, they really are giants. It's in the rc
[01:53:59.840 --> 01:54:02.400]   Here's where the car is really
[01:54:02.400 --> 01:54:06.240]   And here is here is the uh
[01:54:06.240 --> 01:54:08.640]   here is the
[01:54:08.640 --> 01:54:11.280]   The actual photo before we touch it
[01:54:11.280 --> 01:54:14.160]   A lot of people
[01:54:14.160 --> 01:54:19.280]   A lot of people really uh didn't you know, this is uh, this is example of fake news really distorting
[01:54:20.000 --> 01:54:22.000]   Yeah, that's good stuff
[01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:25.040]   That's good rax good fun
[01:54:25.040 --> 01:54:29.040]   Yeah, nice
[01:54:29.040 --> 01:54:33.360]   Let's uh, let's see anything else. I want to do a changelog. I really do
[01:54:33.360 --> 01:54:41.280]   Uh, let's let's let's wait a minute. Is there not a changelog? Yeah, there is. It's a pretty small one
[01:54:41.280 --> 01:54:44.720]   It's a teensy one play the drums. It's time for the google changelog
[01:54:48.800 --> 01:54:51.920]   Oh, hallelujah, hallelujah if you've been using
[01:54:51.920 --> 01:54:53.920]   stadia
[01:54:53.920 --> 01:54:57.360]   google's uh gaming streaming gaming service
[01:54:57.360 --> 01:55:02.240]   You have been moaning along with everybody else. In fact, we even mentioned a couple of weeks ago. There is no
[01:55:02.240 --> 01:55:07.040]   Search even from the search giant to find the game you want
[01:55:07.040 --> 01:55:10.880]   Google has finally added a search bar to the stadia store
[01:55:10.880 --> 01:55:16.400]   To allow you to search through the 172 games currently on the service now if they could only find
[01:55:16.720 --> 01:55:18.960]   Some new executives to replace the ones who left
[01:55:18.960 --> 01:55:21.680]   They might have a shot at it
[01:55:21.680 --> 01:55:30.240]   So finally a search bar added after after almost two years that that is pretty ridiculous. It's ridiculous
[01:55:30.240 --> 01:55:33.040]   You're the search company
[01:55:33.040 --> 01:55:34.480]   Yeah
[01:55:34.480 --> 01:55:38.000]   Google assistant will finally be able to say your name correctly
[01:55:38.000 --> 01:55:41.200]   apples always had this feature
[01:55:41.200 --> 01:55:43.920]   that you could say
[01:55:43.920 --> 01:55:45.280]   uh, you know
[01:55:45.280 --> 01:55:48.880]   Here's how you say my name in the in serie because serie never knew
[01:55:48.880 --> 01:55:55.200]   Google finally in the assistant you can scroll down in the settings tap on google assistant tap on the u badge
[01:55:55.200 --> 01:55:59.120]   uh under basic info type on nickname and you can
[01:55:59.120 --> 01:56:05.280]   You can listen to the way google would pronounce that name or you can recall record your own
[01:56:05.280 --> 01:56:09.120]   So this is rolling out
[01:56:09.120 --> 01:56:14.400]   I will then say back in the google voice or in your voice. Yeah in the google voice
[01:56:14.640 --> 01:56:16.800]   Yeah, you just tell us given us some information
[01:56:16.800 --> 01:56:20.640]   It doesn't just for you. It's anyone in your family from what I understand
[01:56:20.640 --> 01:56:25.120]   I don't know if that's going to extend into other contacts at some point as well, but yeah
[01:56:25.120 --> 01:56:29.200]   What uh, what I like and I google I don't know does
[01:56:29.200 --> 01:56:32.800]   Mr. All about android because google have a feature that you can change your nickname
[01:56:32.800 --> 01:56:35.280]   See what listen i'm gonna tell serie to change my nickname
[01:56:35.280 --> 01:56:38.160]   Change my nickname
[01:56:38.160 --> 01:56:43.120]   And then it says, okay, what would you like me to call you actually I should turn up the sun
[01:56:43.120 --> 01:57:01.040]   >> And I think I'm going to 8, 8, 8, 8, 6.
[01:57:01.040 --> 01:57:01.880]   >> Thank you.
[01:57:01.880 --> 01:57:17.800]   >> I'm going to be here for another five hours.
[01:57:17.800 --> 01:57:18.800]   >> H.J.
[01:57:18.800 --> 01:57:19.800]   >> Oh, please.
[01:57:19.800 --> 01:57:20.800]   Come on, Siri.
[01:57:20.800 --> 01:57:21.800]   >> Sorry, come on.
[01:57:21.800 --> 01:57:22.800]   >> I'm is that.
[01:57:22.800 --> 01:57:23.800]   Could you say that?
[01:57:23.800 --> 01:57:24.800]   >> That's what you get, Leo.
[01:57:24.800 --> 01:57:25.800]   >> Take that.
[01:57:25.800 --> 01:57:26.800]   >> It's a fun trick.
[01:57:26.800 --> 01:57:27.800]   That's what you get.
[01:57:27.800 --> 01:57:28.800]   >> So yes, I just looked it up.
[01:57:28.800 --> 01:57:29.800]   You can edit your own name.
[01:57:29.800 --> 01:57:30.800]   >> Okay.
[01:57:30.800 --> 01:57:33.800]   >> Change the name your Google Assistant calls you.
[01:57:33.800 --> 01:57:40.200]   You go into a H.J. Open Assistant Settings, tap Basic Information, tap Nick Name, Edit,
[01:57:40.200 --> 01:57:42.400]   and make your changes there.
[01:57:42.400 --> 01:57:46.960]   >> Google has announced, oh, you already did this story, so I don't know.
[01:57:46.960 --> 01:57:47.960]   It's not really a choice.
[01:57:47.960 --> 01:57:48.960]   >> Yeah, yeah, I'm sorry.
[01:57:48.960 --> 01:57:53.200]   >> The Pixel A, but A series, they accidentally unveiled it.
[01:57:53.200 --> 01:57:54.960]   So that won't be very excited.
[01:57:54.960 --> 01:57:55.960]   Wait a minute.
[01:57:55.960 --> 01:57:59.040]   >> That Jason did in his own changelog, yeah.
[01:57:59.040 --> 01:58:00.560]   >> Yeah, that's good.
[01:58:00.560 --> 01:58:06.560]   >> Google's bringing a Google TV-like experience to Android tablets.
[01:58:06.560 --> 01:58:08.520]   >> Yeah.
[01:58:08.520 --> 01:58:11.880]   >> This is Florence Ion's story from Gizmodo, her new master.
[01:58:11.880 --> 01:58:12.880]   >> Go ahead, Florence.
[01:58:12.880 --> 01:58:18.360]   >> Go ahead and do that thing that you do so well.
[01:58:18.360 --> 01:58:19.680]   Entertainment spaces the name of it.
[01:58:19.680 --> 01:58:22.360]   Quick access to movies, shows, games.
[01:58:22.360 --> 01:58:24.440]   Does anybody have an Android tablet?
[01:58:24.440 --> 01:58:26.080]   That's what I was laughing about.
[01:58:26.080 --> 01:58:28.000]   It starts with Walmart, too.
[01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:29.560]   It's a special thing with Walmart.
[01:58:29.560 --> 01:58:30.560]   >> Oh, that is crazy.
[01:58:30.560 --> 01:58:32.320]   >> They're on tablet cheap.
[01:58:32.320 --> 01:58:34.080]   Those are the really cheapo.
[01:58:34.080 --> 01:58:39.000]   We still have an old Sony Android tablet that gets used here in the home for watching Netflix
[01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:40.000]   or YouTube.
[01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:46.640]   >> Yeah, I mean, at the very least, those, you know, not too updated tablets.
[01:58:46.640 --> 01:58:47.640]   At least they do that.
[01:58:47.640 --> 01:58:49.120]   >> Yeah, they still works with that.
[01:58:49.120 --> 01:58:50.120]   That's all it's good for.
[01:58:50.120 --> 01:58:53.280]   >> Cue my lament for my Nexus 7, which I adored.
[01:58:53.280 --> 01:58:54.280]   I would buy it again.
[01:58:54.280 --> 01:58:55.280]   >> Yeah, it was awesome.
[01:58:55.280 --> 01:58:56.280]   >> Yeah.
[01:58:56.280 --> 01:58:58.560]   >> Yeah, you have Hall of Fame device there as far as I'm concerned.
[01:58:58.560 --> 01:59:01.400]   >> Yeah, I had two of them and they finally just died on me.
[01:59:01.400 --> 01:59:02.400]   Yeah.
[01:59:02.400 --> 01:59:03.400]   Yeah.
[01:59:03.400 --> 01:59:07.960]   You know what was wrong with them was the storage they use really wore out.
[01:59:07.960 --> 01:59:08.960]   >> Yeah, it did.
[01:59:08.960 --> 01:59:09.960]   >> It was a storage issue.
[01:59:09.960 --> 01:59:10.960]   >> Yeah, you're right.
[01:59:10.960 --> 01:59:11.960]   You're right.
[01:59:11.960 --> 01:59:12.960]   I did have problems.
[01:59:12.960 --> 01:59:13.960]   Yep.
[01:59:13.960 --> 01:59:14.960]   >> Yep.
[01:59:14.960 --> 01:59:16.260]   >> YouTube has started testing something that's actually been around for a long time.
[01:59:16.260 --> 01:59:21.000]   If you use SoundCloud, you know, you can put a comment in the audio stream and it shows
[01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:22.000]   up as you're playing.
[01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:25.040]   They're little dots on the bottom on the timeline and it shows up.
[01:59:25.040 --> 01:59:29.480]   It was testing time-linked comments on YouTube videos now.
[01:59:29.480 --> 01:59:30.480]   >> Like that.
[01:59:30.480 --> 01:59:31.480]   >> Yeah.
[01:59:31.480 --> 01:59:32.480]   I love that.
[01:59:32.480 --> 01:59:33.480]   >> Super handy.
[01:59:33.480 --> 01:59:34.480]   >> Yeah.
[01:59:34.480 --> 01:59:36.680]   >> I love how SoundCloud has implemented that.
[01:59:36.680 --> 01:59:37.680]   Yeah, you're right.
[01:59:37.680 --> 01:59:40.080]   They've had it on SoundCloud for a very long time.
[01:59:40.080 --> 01:59:41.080]   >> Years.
[01:59:41.080 --> 01:59:42.080]   >> But what do you like about it?
[01:59:42.080 --> 01:59:43.080]   >> Yes, it's very useful.
[01:59:43.080 --> 01:59:44.080]   >> What do you like about it?
[01:59:44.080 --> 01:59:49.120]   I see that and I've assumed that it was just another way to drive engagement if people
[01:59:49.120 --> 01:59:50.120]   read it.
[01:59:50.120 --> 01:59:51.520]   What do you like about it?
[01:59:51.520 --> 01:59:57.640]   >> Well, I mean, on SoundCloud, specifically, I'm probably listening to a song and if I
[01:59:57.640 --> 02:00:01.680]   see a cluster of comments around a certain area, it either means that's really great
[02:00:01.680 --> 02:00:02.680]   or it's not.
[02:00:02.680 --> 02:00:03.880]   You know, something that happens there.
[02:00:03.880 --> 02:00:04.880]   I don't know.
[02:00:04.880 --> 02:00:09.960]   It's just an added bit of context to the experience that isn't detached in a comment section
[02:00:09.960 --> 02:00:10.960]   down below.
[02:00:10.960 --> 02:00:14.840]   It's actually kind of in real time associated with a particular moment in whatever media
[02:00:14.840 --> 02:00:16.560]   I'm listening to.
[02:00:16.560 --> 02:00:17.560]   And I don't know.
[02:00:17.560 --> 02:00:19.360]   I appreciate that extra layer.
[02:00:19.360 --> 02:00:20.360]   >> Nice.
[02:00:20.360 --> 02:00:21.360]   >> Yeah.
[02:00:21.360 --> 02:00:23.440]   All righty.
[02:00:23.440 --> 02:00:25.640]   That's the Google change log.
[02:00:25.640 --> 02:00:27.880]   >> Short and sweet.
[02:00:27.880 --> 02:00:28.880]   >> Short and sweet.
[02:00:28.880 --> 02:00:30.160]   Prepare your picks of the week.
[02:00:30.160 --> 02:00:31.400]   They're coming up next.
[02:00:31.400 --> 02:00:34.440]   But first a word from our sponsor, CashFly.
[02:00:34.440 --> 02:00:37.280]   This week in Google literally brought to you by CashFly.
[02:00:37.280 --> 02:00:41.920]   It's the CDN, the content delivery network we've been using for over 10 years.
[02:00:41.920 --> 02:00:47.640]   It started literally now 21 years ago, 1999.
[02:00:47.640 --> 02:00:50.440]   CashFly has gotten better and better and better.
[02:00:50.440 --> 02:00:55.200]   It's one of the reasons, you know, people, you may not be aware of it, but you know,
[02:00:55.200 --> 02:00:57.160]   our podcasts are download fast.
[02:00:57.160 --> 02:00:58.440]   They're always there.
[02:00:58.440 --> 02:01:02.840]   You never get a server disappearing or, you know, file not found error.
[02:01:02.840 --> 02:01:05.080]   And that's, that's because of CashFly.
[02:01:05.080 --> 02:01:07.760]   Now CashFly is just added a new feature, which is amazing.
[02:01:07.760 --> 02:01:09.520]   Ultra low latency streaming.
[02:01:09.520 --> 02:01:12.520]   It's not the web RTC solution that's let you down in the past.
[02:01:12.520 --> 02:01:18.760]   It's a new feature that's available in the past.
[02:01:18.760 --> 02:01:22.760]   And it's a new feature that's available in the past.
[02:01:22.760 --> 02:01:25.760]   It's a new feature that's available in the past.

[02:04:27.960 --> 02:04:30.960]   This looks like something you might use in your music.
[02:04:30.960 --> 02:04:31.960]   Yeah.
[02:04:31.960 --> 02:04:35.960]   I'm talking about this not because it's anything new necessarily.
[02:04:35.960 --> 02:04:39.960]   I think this actually came out like a year and a half ago.
[02:04:39.960 --> 02:04:40.960]   My camera's here.
[02:04:40.960 --> 02:04:41.960]   Oh, there it is.
[02:04:41.960 --> 02:04:42.960]   Here it is.
[02:04:42.960 --> 02:04:43.960]   It's the Apollo Twin X.
[02:04:43.960 --> 02:04:44.960]   Oh, it's called by UAD.
[02:04:44.960 --> 02:04:46.960]   Oh, it's called by Nixi Clock.
[02:04:46.960 --> 02:04:47.960]   Yeah, I know.
[02:04:47.960 --> 02:04:49.960]   It's actually -- well, not quite as cool.
[02:04:49.960 --> 02:04:52.960]   I don't need gloves to use it though, so at least there's that.
[02:04:52.960 --> 02:04:54.960]   Yeah, the voice is hard.
[02:04:54.960 --> 02:04:56.960]   Oh, Lord.
[02:04:56.960 --> 02:04:57.960]   Lord.
[02:04:57.960 --> 02:05:00.960]   But I'm kind of smitten with this right now.
[02:05:00.960 --> 02:05:02.960]   I got it, I don't know, about a month ago.
[02:05:02.960 --> 02:05:04.960]   It's an audio interface.
[02:05:04.960 --> 02:05:10.960]   The thing about the Apollo Twin X is that it's by a company called Universal Audio.
[02:05:10.960 --> 02:05:17.960]   And they make a lot of hardware, but they also make a lot of really high quality audio production plugins.
[02:05:17.960 --> 02:05:23.960]   And what you get when you buy this kind of hardware, this runs -- I think this was 800 bucks.
[02:05:23.960 --> 02:05:27.960]   And then they have some that you can get that are more powerful.
[02:05:27.960 --> 02:05:35.960]   They have inside of them something called a shark processor, which is -- I mean, a processor specifically supports their own plugins.
[02:05:35.960 --> 02:05:43.960]   So in order to use any of the plugins that Universal Audio has created, you need their hardware to do it.
[02:05:43.960 --> 02:05:51.960]   And so this allows me to plug in an instrument, either a guitar or I can do mic inputs on the back and everything.
[02:05:51.960 --> 02:06:06.960]   And I can do something called unison, which essentially means that I can take models of real, like, classic audio hardware, like the Neve 88RS channel strip, for example.
[02:06:06.960 --> 02:06:15.960]   Like, you know, these old, like, hardware outboard gear that it would cost tens of thousands of dollars for me to bring into my studio.
[02:06:15.960 --> 02:06:22.960]   Instead, Universal Audio has gone through and they've done modeling of these things to a very precise level.
[02:06:22.960 --> 02:06:32.960]   And then they've made it completely off-board from the processor in your computer, so that all the processing is happening inside of this device and with no latency.
[02:06:32.960 --> 02:06:41.960]   So, for example, if I wanted to plug my guitar in here and pretend like I'm plugging directly into that Neve channel strip, I get zero latency when I do that.
[02:06:41.960 --> 02:06:52.960]   And it's all modeled in real time. And it's just so cool to be, to feel like I'm pulling up these, you know, classic pieces of hardware gear, audio hardware.
[02:06:52.960 --> 02:07:01.960]   And, you know, and I know it's probably not 100% the same as having the actual piece of hardware on my rack, but it's about as close as I'm ever going to get.
[02:07:01.960 --> 02:07:03.960]   And it really does sound incredible.
[02:07:03.960 --> 02:07:11.960]   And having the lack of latency for performance, you know, when you do a music production, you want no latency, ideally.
[02:07:11.960 --> 02:07:20.960]   And any time that I've been doing this sort of, like, plug-in management for writing music, I've always dealt with latency and just gotten used to it.
[02:07:20.960 --> 02:07:23.960]   Now I don't have to, and it's like a dream come true, I'm loving it.
[02:07:23.960 --> 02:07:27.960]   So, it's called the Apollo Twin X by Universal Audio.
[02:07:27.960 --> 02:07:30.960]   If you make music, look for it. It's pretty cool.
[02:07:30.960 --> 02:07:33.960]   Very nice. Yeah.
[02:07:33.960 --> 02:07:37.960]   You are talented. You want to give a plug for Yellow Gold and where we can find your music?
[02:07:37.960 --> 02:07:45.960]   Oh, sure. Yeah. YellowGoldMusic.com is the site that has any of the albums that I've done to date.
[02:07:45.960 --> 02:07:50.960]   I kind of feel like I'm, especially with the purchase of this, and I got a new guitar, not too long ago.
[02:07:50.960 --> 02:07:57.960]   I kind of feel like I've been working on ideas and stuff, and I'm working towards something. I don't know what it is quite yet.
[02:07:57.960 --> 02:08:01.960]   But any of the music that I've done already is at YellowGoldMusic.com.
[02:08:01.960 --> 02:08:03.960]   Check it out. It's all there. It's free.
[02:08:03.960 --> 02:08:04.960]   Nice. Thank you.
[02:08:04.960 --> 02:08:08.960]   Yeah. And that's the album cover over your right shoulder there.
[02:08:08.960 --> 02:08:14.960]   Oh, yeah. That's the art. A friend of mine, Ben Minter. And then also Scott Johnson.
[02:08:14.960 --> 02:08:16.960]   So, it's kind of like emerging.
[02:08:16.960 --> 02:08:19.960]   Oh, I didn't realize that. They both did. They both did stuff.
[02:08:19.960 --> 02:08:25.960]   Yeah. I gave them both a photo of me and said, "Do your art, and then I'm going to scale it together and kind of do a mixture of both of them."
[02:08:25.960 --> 02:08:27.960]   That's awesome. That's awesome.
[02:08:27.960 --> 02:08:29.960]   Yeah. It turned out really good.
[02:08:29.960 --> 02:08:35.960]   I should play some YellowGold. I don't think we've ever played it on the show. Is there a song that you really like?
[02:08:35.960 --> 02:08:39.960]   You'll make me blush if you do that. I know I would do it, but disconnected.
[02:08:39.960 --> 02:08:42.960]   You play all the instruments, right? Oh, yeah.
[02:08:42.960 --> 02:08:46.960]   Yeah. This was an outtake from the last album.
[02:08:46.960 --> 02:08:53.960]   Yeah. Yeah. I do all the instruments. This is way more electronic than most of the stuff I do.
[02:08:53.960 --> 02:08:56.960]   But a lot of the other stuff I do is more indie.
[02:08:56.960 --> 02:08:58.960]   Yeah. I love the rock.
[02:08:58.960 --> 02:09:01.960]   Yeah. Thank you. It's called Freeform.
[02:09:01.960 --> 02:09:03.960]   Yeah. Thank you. You can use it right there.
[02:09:03.960 --> 02:09:04.960]   Hey, there you go.
[02:09:04.960 --> 02:09:06.960]   Thank you. I'm a photo artist.
[02:09:06.960 --> 02:09:07.960]   No, but...
[02:09:07.960 --> 02:09:11.960]   Yeah. Right on. Thank you. Nice. Thank you, Jason.
[02:09:11.960 --> 02:09:15.960]   Now, if Jason Howl.com takes us down...
[02:09:15.960 --> 02:09:17.960]   That would have been...
[02:09:17.960 --> 02:09:20.960]   Don't worry. You've got nothing to worry about as far as I know.
[02:09:20.960 --> 02:09:24.960]   I've got the yellow gold lawyers all over me now.
[02:09:24.960 --> 02:09:27.960]   Jeff Jarvis, number of the week.
[02:09:27.960 --> 02:09:29.960]   So I'm going to do a thing this week.
[02:09:29.960 --> 02:09:31.960]   Does anybody know... I'm assuming you see it.
[02:09:31.960 --> 02:09:33.960]   But that is. Can you see it?
[02:09:33.960 --> 02:09:35.960]   I'm thinking you should have done it.
[02:09:35.960 --> 02:09:38.960]   It looks like a relay. I don't know what is that.
[02:09:38.960 --> 02:09:41.960]   Is that a Bitcoin? No. Oh, it's an actual Bitcoin.
[02:09:41.960 --> 02:09:47.960]   It's a Doge. This is part of my favorite machine ever made in history.
[02:09:47.960 --> 02:09:49.960]   You can see there's a little key...
[02:09:49.960 --> 02:09:51.960]   It's got to be a line inside.
[02:09:51.960 --> 02:09:52.960]   Bingo.
[02:09:52.960 --> 02:09:54.960]   This is the mold.
[02:09:54.960 --> 02:09:56.960]   The matrix for a line type. So you can't...
[02:09:56.960 --> 02:09:58.960]   It's hard to get the thing to focus.
[02:09:58.960 --> 02:10:00.960]   But you see those two little indentations on top there?
[02:10:00.960 --> 02:10:02.960]   Are you calling me a thing now?
[02:10:02.960 --> 02:10:04.960]   Yeah.
[02:10:04.960 --> 02:10:06.960]   That's the letter H 9.
[02:10:06.960 --> 02:10:08.960]   Oh, that's cool.
[02:10:08.960 --> 02:10:10.960]   This looks like a...
[02:10:10.960 --> 02:10:13.960]   kind of an early pre-electric Pac-Man.
[02:10:13.960 --> 02:10:16.960]   These little teeth?
[02:10:16.960 --> 02:10:18.960]   So these teeth are in a key pattern.
[02:10:18.960 --> 02:10:20.960]   So when the mold would shoot down,
[02:10:20.960 --> 02:10:23.960]   this would come out of each part of the magazine.
[02:10:23.960 --> 02:10:26.960]   Then it would go up and the printer could see on the other side.
[02:10:26.960 --> 02:10:28.960]   It says, "Oh, it's an H." You could see what the line was going to be.
[02:10:28.960 --> 02:10:30.960]   The line got all created.
[02:10:30.960 --> 02:10:31.960]   It got molded.
[02:10:31.960 --> 02:10:34.960]   And then all these went back up on an elevator to the top of the machine.
[02:10:34.960 --> 02:10:36.960]   They went around and around and around this thing.
[02:10:36.960 --> 02:10:41.960]   Where when the teeth met the right pattern,
[02:10:41.960 --> 02:10:44.960]   it would fall back in with the other ages.
[02:10:44.960 --> 02:10:49.960]   This was incredibly revolutionary in the history of all.
[02:10:49.960 --> 02:10:53.960]   It was kind of the last big machine in the Gutenberg age.
[02:10:53.960 --> 02:10:58.960]   So I just won a cheap auction on eBay to get a box of these on one of these for years.
[02:10:58.960 --> 02:10:59.960]   Oh, that's hysterical.
[02:10:59.960 --> 02:11:00.960]   That's hysterical.
[02:11:00.960 --> 02:11:02.960]   Oh, that's hysterical.
[02:11:02.960 --> 02:11:04.960]   So these are the matrices.
[02:11:04.960 --> 02:11:07.960]   We used to be called a "patrix" and a "matrix."
[02:11:07.960 --> 02:11:11.960]   The "patrix" was the stamp you'd do it, which had the letter and the positive.
[02:11:11.960 --> 02:11:15.960]   And the matrix was in the negative. It was the female.
[02:11:15.960 --> 02:11:17.960]   And so this is a matrix mold.
[02:11:17.960 --> 02:11:18.960]   So were the letter H?
[02:11:18.960 --> 02:11:21.960]   Line of types have been around since Gutenberg era.
[02:11:21.960 --> 02:11:30.960]   It was the last lead, hot lead innovation since the 1890s.
[02:11:30.960 --> 02:11:32.960]   And until the 1970s.
[02:11:32.960 --> 02:11:39.960]   When I was a little kid, my friend Joseph had a hot lead soldier kid.
[02:11:39.960 --> 02:11:42.960]   And I can't believe they sold this to children.
[02:11:42.960 --> 02:11:43.960]   I know.
[02:11:43.960 --> 02:11:51.960]   You would melt lead on your stove and then pour it into molds for lead soldiers.
[02:11:51.960 --> 02:11:54.960]   And I came over one afternoon. We did that all afternoon.
[02:11:54.960 --> 02:11:56.960]   Nobody got maimed.
[02:11:56.960 --> 02:11:59.960]   And then you suck on them and you're like the bloodstream.
[02:11:59.960 --> 02:12:00.960]   Yeah.
[02:12:00.960 --> 02:12:05.960]   I can't believe now that I think of it that they sold that.
[02:12:05.960 --> 02:12:06.960]   Wow.
[02:12:06.960 --> 02:12:07.960]   Yeah.
[02:12:07.960 --> 02:12:09.960]   That's interesting.
[02:12:09.960 --> 02:12:12.960]   Aunt Pruitt, let's get a pick from you, sir.
[02:12:12.960 --> 02:12:17.960]   My first pick is I want to give a shout out to Pen for Ware.
[02:12:17.960 --> 02:12:23.960]   They are, this is a friend of mine that basically years ago decided to just start creating music
[02:12:23.960 --> 02:12:29.960]   and getting a collective of musicians together and putting content out there.
[02:12:29.960 --> 02:12:33.960]   So other content creators can use their music and they actually get paid.
[02:12:33.960 --> 02:12:35.960]   The musicians actually get paid.
[02:12:35.960 --> 02:12:37.960]   They've since grown that site.
[02:12:37.960 --> 02:12:43.960]   He has since grown that site and he's now also connected with disco and he's offering basically
[02:12:43.960 --> 02:12:49.960]   a license in way a perpetual license for people to add music to their content.
[02:12:49.960 --> 02:12:53.960]   You know, and it all depends on the price, depends on the type of license you want to use.
[02:12:53.960 --> 02:13:00.960]   I think they started like 200 bucks or if you're a member of disco, the disco is tied into it as well
[02:13:00.960 --> 02:13:02.960]   because you have a disco subscription.
[02:13:02.960 --> 02:13:08.960]   I've used his tracks before and he's super talented and the musicians that he has with them are all super talented.
[02:13:08.960 --> 02:13:09.960]   You've got to work on them.
[02:13:09.960 --> 02:13:11.960]   There's no country music in here.
[02:13:11.960 --> 02:13:14.960]   At one time there were because I used to laugh at that.
[02:13:14.960 --> 02:13:17.960]   Oh, I made it friendship and country.
[02:13:17.960 --> 02:13:18.960]   That's my mistake.
[02:13:18.960 --> 02:13:20.960]   There's lots of country music.
[02:13:20.960 --> 02:13:22.960]   I'm getting tired of this place.
[02:13:22.960 --> 02:13:24.960]   That's the song I should play for you.
[02:13:24.960 --> 02:13:25.960]   Look at that.
[02:13:25.960 --> 02:13:29.960]   There was a time this was my kingdom.
[02:13:29.960 --> 02:13:32.960]   So I could get this royalty for it.
[02:13:32.960 --> 02:13:33.960]   I'm not paying for it.
[02:13:33.960 --> 02:13:34.960]   So I'm going to stop right there.
[02:13:34.960 --> 02:13:35.960]   But that sounds pretty darn good.
[02:13:35.960 --> 02:13:37.960]   Yeah, it's all pretty high quality stuff.
[02:13:37.960 --> 02:13:38.960]   Wow.
[02:13:38.960 --> 02:13:39.960]   I'm impressed.
[02:13:39.960 --> 02:13:40.960]   And he's been doing this for his Pete Perwett.
[02:13:40.960 --> 02:13:43.960]   Penful of years now and it's starting to grow.
[02:13:43.960 --> 02:13:47.960]   And I just wanted to give him some kudos just to see the growth of these experiences.
[02:13:47.960 --> 02:13:48.960]   Nice.
[02:13:48.960 --> 02:13:50.960]   And then next I will do it.
[02:13:50.960 --> 02:13:53.960]   And F-U-R-W-A-R-E.
[02:13:53.960 --> 02:13:54.960]   That's correct.
[02:13:54.960 --> 02:13:56.960]   .disco.ac.
[02:13:56.960 --> 02:13:58.960]   But just Google a pan for where I'm sure you'll go.
[02:13:58.960 --> 02:14:05.960]   And next I want to give a shout out to Floss Weekly, the episode that dropped at the time
[02:14:05.960 --> 02:14:09.960]   of this recording featured Dr. Andre Kudra.
[02:14:09.960 --> 02:14:16.960]   And they talked about SSI and something called demo scene that I had never heard of.
[02:14:16.960 --> 02:14:17.960]   Oh, Del Zing.
[02:14:17.960 --> 02:14:18.960]   So, get me started.
[02:14:18.960 --> 02:14:19.960]   Oh, yeah.
[02:14:19.960 --> 02:14:20.960]   It was so fascinating.
[02:14:20.960 --> 02:14:21.960]   Mostly Germany.
[02:14:21.960 --> 02:14:24.960]   Although I think you did you ever get into the world?
[02:14:24.960 --> 02:14:29.960]   I think it was a lot of Amiga types doing it.
[02:14:29.960 --> 02:14:31.960]   Amiga and Commodore.
[02:14:31.960 --> 02:14:32.960]   Amiga.
[02:14:32.960 --> 02:14:33.960]   Yeah.
[02:14:33.960 --> 02:14:34.960]   Yeah.
[02:14:34.960 --> 02:14:38.960]   I remember obsessing over the demo scene when that happened.
[02:14:38.960 --> 02:14:39.960]   Yeah.
[02:14:39.960 --> 02:14:41.960]   But I never, never participated.
[02:14:41.960 --> 02:14:45.960]   I always wished that I had a lot of time.
[02:14:45.960 --> 02:14:48.960]   And I was like, "Oh, I'm not going to be a fan of this."
[02:14:48.960 --> 02:14:51.960]   And I was like, "Oh, I'm not going to be a fan of this."
[02:14:51.960 --> 02:14:56.960]   And I never participated.
[02:14:56.960 --> 02:15:01.960]   I always wished that I could back then, but I didn't.
[02:15:01.960 --> 02:15:02.960]   Yeah.
[02:15:02.960 --> 02:15:07.960]   I had a hard time TDing the show this morning because I kept getting glued in on what he
[02:15:07.960 --> 02:15:10.960]   was saying instead of TDing the show.
[02:15:10.960 --> 02:15:13.960]   It was so diagram fascinating.
[02:15:13.960 --> 02:15:19.960]   And that was with Mr. Doc Seros and Mr. Aaron Nukem and Dr. Andre Kudra.
[02:15:19.960 --> 02:15:20.960]   And music.
[02:15:20.960 --> 02:15:24.960]   And I guess that's probably why this is somebody talking about them.
[02:15:24.960 --> 02:15:27.960]   But this is kind of what they looked like.
[02:15:27.960 --> 02:15:29.960]   They were very, they're dated now.
[02:15:29.960 --> 02:15:31.960]   They look so old now.
[02:15:31.960 --> 02:15:35.960]   But they didn't have any actual resources, computer resources.
[02:15:35.960 --> 02:15:38.960]   This stuff was done in like 256 bytes.
[02:15:38.960 --> 02:15:39.960]   Exactly.
[02:15:39.960 --> 02:15:40.960]   Yeah.
[02:15:40.960 --> 02:15:41.960]   Yeah.
[02:15:41.960 --> 02:15:42.960]   Yeah.
[02:15:42.960 --> 02:15:43.960]   Yeah.
[02:15:43.960 --> 02:15:48.960]   I mean, on the Commodore 64, you know, Floyd Duck in the Discord is talking about.
[02:15:48.960 --> 02:15:51.960]   The Commerce 64, of course, didn't have any video.
[02:15:51.960 --> 02:15:53.960]   It was just 64K.
[02:15:53.960 --> 02:15:58.960]   So the demos were often just the SID chip and the really cool song that somebody created
[02:15:58.960 --> 02:15:59.960]   with the SID chip.
[02:15:59.960 --> 02:16:00.960]   Yeah.
[02:16:00.960 --> 02:16:01.960]   Yeah.
[02:16:01.960 --> 02:16:04.960]   And then like a bouncing set of letters, you know, for the cracking group or whatever the
[02:16:04.960 --> 02:16:06.960]   group was called, you know, and cracking.
[02:16:06.960 --> 02:16:07.960]   Yeah.
[02:16:07.960 --> 02:16:08.960]   He mentioned that today.
[02:16:08.960 --> 02:16:09.960]   Yeah.
[02:16:09.960 --> 02:16:12.960]   Me and my friends would collect those things.
[02:16:12.960 --> 02:16:13.960]   Yeah.
[02:16:13.960 --> 02:16:15.960]   I got really obsessed with them at a certain point.
[02:16:15.960 --> 02:16:19.960]   And then we started me and my friend would record the music to an audio cassette and we
[02:16:19.960 --> 02:16:20.960]   would trade the cassettes.
[02:16:20.960 --> 02:16:21.960]   And that was like what I listened to.
[02:16:21.960 --> 02:16:23.960]   This was back in like the sixth grade.
[02:16:23.960 --> 02:16:25.960]   So I was a big fan of them.
[02:16:25.960 --> 02:16:26.960]   Oh, that's cool.
[02:16:26.960 --> 02:16:27.960]   That's so cool.
[02:16:27.960 --> 02:16:28.960]   I don't know why.
[02:16:28.960 --> 02:16:29.960]   But I kind of thought you might have been.
[02:16:29.960 --> 02:16:30.960]   Yeah.
[02:16:30.960 --> 02:16:31.960]   That's really hysterical.
[02:16:31.960 --> 02:16:32.960]   Yeah.
[02:16:32.960 --> 02:16:33.960]   That's floss weekly.
[02:16:33.960 --> 02:16:34.960]   Twit.tv/floss.
[02:16:34.960 --> 02:16:35.960]   Yes.
[02:16:35.960 --> 02:16:36.960]   That's a great show.
[02:16:36.960 --> 02:16:37.960]   Great show.
[02:16:37.960 --> 02:16:38.960]   Good show today.
[02:16:38.960 --> 02:16:39.960]   Great show.
[02:16:39.960 --> 02:16:41.960]   And then lastly, I want to show this.
[02:16:41.960 --> 02:16:42.960]   This is good.
[02:16:42.960 --> 02:16:43.960]   Go ahead.
[02:16:43.960 --> 02:16:44.960]   Go ahead.
[02:16:44.960 --> 02:16:45.960]   Oh.
[02:16:45.960 --> 02:16:46.960]   For me?
[02:16:46.960 --> 02:16:47.960]   Oh, there it is.
[02:16:47.960 --> 02:16:48.960]   Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:16:48.960 --> 02:16:49.960]   Yeah.
[02:16:49.960 --> 02:16:55.960]   Lastly, the hard head, freshman hard head beat his senior hard head in the track meet last
[02:16:55.960 --> 02:16:56.960]   week.
[02:16:56.960 --> 02:16:57.960]   So I wanted to give him a shout out.
[02:16:57.960 --> 02:16:58.960]   They're currently racing now.
[02:16:58.960 --> 02:17:03.960]   That message I got early as they ran the four by 100 and won that race.
[02:17:03.960 --> 02:17:04.960]   Oh man.
[02:17:04.960 --> 02:17:05.960]   You keep listening to races.
[02:17:05.960 --> 02:17:08.960]   They're all going after the show.
[02:17:08.960 --> 02:17:10.960]   And they're going against Cardinal Newman today.
[02:17:10.960 --> 02:17:11.960]   Oh, the big one.
[02:17:11.960 --> 02:17:13.960]   They've already won the relay.
[02:17:13.960 --> 02:17:14.960]   Nice.
[02:17:14.960 --> 02:17:17.960]   But the freshman hard head, I'm quite impressed and proud of him.
[02:17:17.960 --> 02:17:20.960]   He had about a 19 foot long jump.
[02:17:20.960 --> 02:17:22.960]   I saw that video too.
[02:17:22.960 --> 02:17:29.960]   100 meters was, I think he ran at 11, 100 meters, which is pretty fast for him.
[02:17:29.960 --> 02:17:32.640]   And he ended up getting the super high rating.
[02:17:32.640 --> 02:17:35.480]   I think he's like the number one freshman here right now.
[02:17:35.480 --> 02:17:39.480]   So how does his older brother feel about that?
[02:17:39.480 --> 02:17:40.480]   Not too good.
[02:17:40.480 --> 02:17:42.480]   But his competitive.
[02:17:42.480 --> 02:17:43.480]   He's competitive.
[02:17:43.480 --> 02:17:45.720]   There's no hate for one another.
[02:17:45.720 --> 02:17:50.480]   They both know that they can work their butts off and they root for each other.
[02:17:50.480 --> 02:17:51.480]   They train together.
[02:17:51.480 --> 02:17:54.480]   So yeah, he's pretty proud moment.
[02:17:54.480 --> 02:17:56.480]   That's nice.
[02:17:56.480 --> 02:18:02.480]   Follow an on Twitter, @_pru@ptt.
[02:18:02.480 --> 02:18:03.480]   Yes, sir.
[02:18:03.480 --> 02:18:04.480]   Well, that rags.
[02:18:04.480 --> 02:18:05.480]   Leo, Leo.
[02:18:05.480 --> 02:18:06.480]   Yes.
[02:18:06.480 --> 02:18:09.480]   We had a demonstration earlier in the program that failed.
[02:18:09.480 --> 02:18:13.360]   And I was able to track down the rehearsal for that demonstration.
[02:18:13.360 --> 02:18:17.720]   So I think we should play the rehearsal of the demonstration that failed earlier today.
[02:18:17.720 --> 02:18:21.480]   This is the demonstration that failed earlier in the day.
[02:18:21.480 --> 02:18:22.480]   Oh, yeah.
[02:18:22.480 --> 02:18:25.480]   This is when I did this.
[02:18:25.480 --> 02:18:28.480]   What would you like me to call you?
[02:18:28.480 --> 02:18:30.480]   Ah
[02:18:30.480 --> 02:18:32.500]   HHA Shh H uh
[02:18:32.500 --> 02:18:42.680]   H H H ah ah, ah ah, Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah..

[02:18:49.360 --> 02:18:54.580]   Ok, okay, it's more fun if you go on longer but....
[02:18:54.580 --> 02:18:55.060]   It is.
[02:18:55.060 --> 02:19:01.060]   [laughter]
[02:19:01.060 --> 02:19:03.060]   Go on longer, put in more vowels.
[02:19:03.060 --> 02:19:04.060]   [laughter]
[02:19:04.060 --> 02:19:05.060]   It's great fun.
[02:19:05.060 --> 02:19:06.060]   Yeah.
[02:19:06.060 --> 02:19:08.060]   Now I realize I did that once before, ok.
[02:19:08.060 --> 02:19:09.060]   That's the thing.
[02:19:09.060 --> 02:19:10.060]   That's the thing.
[02:19:10.060 --> 02:19:11.060]   You do it your free time, so.
[02:19:11.060 --> 02:19:13.060]   I, it's, it's nuts.
[02:19:13.060 --> 02:19:17.060]   I gotta go home and I gotta revamp the nixie tubes of parallel.
[02:19:17.060 --> 02:19:18.060]   I don't know what I'm saying.
[02:19:18.060 --> 02:19:19.060]   [laughter]
[02:19:19.060 --> 02:19:22.060]   Looks like that fourth one in his little, uh, his little confused.
[02:19:22.060 --> 02:19:23.060]   Yeah, it was a little bit of a glitchy.
[02:19:23.060 --> 02:19:27.060]   A little confused about where he should be nixing his tube.
[02:19:27.060 --> 02:19:33.060]   Um, we do this week in Google every Wednesday right after Windows weekly.
[02:19:33.060 --> 02:19:38.060]   That's usually around 2 p.m. Pacific if it doesn't get sidetracked with the unboxing.
[02:19:38.060 --> 02:19:40.060]   5 p.m. Eastern time.
[02:19:40.060 --> 02:19:42.060]   2,100 UTC.
[02:19:42.060 --> 02:19:45.060]   You can watch us a stream at live at twit.tv/live.
[02:19:45.060 --> 02:19:47.060]   There's audio and video there.
[02:19:47.060 --> 02:19:50.060]   If you're watching live, chat with us live.
[02:19:50.060 --> 02:19:52.060]   I-R-C dot twit.tv.
[02:19:52.060 --> 02:19:55.060]   A lot of nice people in there.
[02:19:55.060 --> 02:19:59.060]   We also of course have a live audio stream in our Discord stage.
[02:19:59.060 --> 02:20:05.060]   If you're a member of Club Trit, come on in and join us during our live streams on any shows.
[02:20:05.060 --> 02:20:11.060]   Uh, Club Trit is $7 a month to get ad free versions of all of our shows plus the Discord.
[02:20:11.060 --> 02:20:15.060]   And one thing I wanted to show you, thanks to Anthony and Nielsen, we've set up a little
[02:20:15.060 --> 02:20:16.060]   notifications system.
[02:20:16.060 --> 02:20:22.060]   If you go in under the welcome in our Discord to notifications setup, you'll see every show
[02:20:22.060 --> 02:20:23.060]   has a notification.
[02:20:23.060 --> 02:20:31.060]   You click the icon for the show or shows you want notifications for and you will get automatically
[02:20:31.060 --> 02:20:35.060]   pinged when we start the show.
[02:20:35.060 --> 02:20:43.060]   Right now, uh, looks like twit has the most notify- notifies at 101.
[02:20:43.060 --> 02:20:46.060]   But let's see what this week in Google, uh, it has.
[02:20:46.060 --> 02:20:47.060]   That's T-N-W.
[02:20:47.060 --> 02:20:51.060]   There is this, that's smart tech today.
[02:20:51.060 --> 02:20:53.060]   Second, it's a second one and there it is.
[02:20:53.060 --> 02:20:54.060]   74.
[02:20:54.060 --> 02:20:55.060]   That's not bad.
[02:20:55.060 --> 02:20:56.060]   Tied with Windows weekly.
[02:20:56.060 --> 02:21:00.060]   So click that if you want to be notified and you will automatically get a notification.
[02:21:00.060 --> 02:21:04.060]   Even if you're not, if you have Discord on your phone and you're not running it, it will,
[02:21:04.060 --> 02:21:09.060]   if you've allowed notifications automatically notify you that we are about to go live.
[02:21:09.060 --> 02:21:15.060]   And then you can join us in the Eastside Live studio up on the stage here.
[02:21:15.060 --> 02:21:20.060]   Uh, YouTube, yes, we've got a YouTube channel for this week in Google.
[02:21:20.060 --> 02:21:21.060]   You can watch all the shows there.
[02:21:21.060 --> 02:21:26.060]   You can also, uh, go to our website, twit.tv/twig.
[02:21:26.060 --> 02:21:31.060]   You'll find a link to the YouTube site there plus all the shows you can download audio or
