[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   It's time for Twig this week in Google. Stacey's back from CES. We'll get a rundown. She said it was actually pretty, pretty interesting.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   She found some cool stuff, including some digital kettlebells at 10 times the cost.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   Jeff Jarvis is going to get very upset, I have a feeling, about an article in Wired about it.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   10 years later, meme. And we'll talk about a bunch of stuff from Google too, that Google changed.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   We're coming up next. We got a big show for you on Twig.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   Netcast you love.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   From people you trust.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   This is Twig.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   This is Twig. This week in Google, episode 491 recorded Wednesday January 16th, 2019.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   A Faust without a Devil.

[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   It's time for Twig. This week in Google, the show that talks about anything but Google pretty much.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   Joining us, Jeff Jarvis from the city university of New YorkBudgeMachine.com.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   Wake up, Jeff. Wake up.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   Before the show, you see people think they missed things before the show? No, no, no, no.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   You missed incredible boredom. Homophones versus what?
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   Heterographs.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   Heterographs and and and.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   Roropen pencils and fake pens.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   We thought we were all on the way. Just too much.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   Last week, apparently Stacey tells us it was the old fart episode last week because she wasn't here and we ended up talking about all of that on the show.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   We got it out of the way this time, ahead of time. Stacey, you got the buzz back.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   How was CES Stacey from Stacey on IoT?
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   Oh, it was lovely. I don't, I don't believe I just said that.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   Wow. It was just lovely.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   Lovely.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   The queen and I got together.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   They think she's Mary Poppins of the tech world.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   That's actually not a bad descriptor of me.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   You kind of are.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   Actually, actually, I'm going to say it. Yes. It does kind of work.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   Like I'm, I'm generally cheerful, but I am stern if I need to be.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   She's practically perfect every way.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   Every way.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   Yes.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   Okay. So CES was boring.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   I did not have, so it, I go and I'm a little different because I'm, I'm super nerdy.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   I go looking in like the chip booths and the weird, like I talked to people about product design looking for like better ways to use battery life or maybe like flexible electronics.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   So I go looking for, I don't go looking for televisions or laptops or anything like that.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   And I do go looking for smart home stuff and I, I didn't find anything new.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   I didn't find anything deeply like game changing or disruptive.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   And that made me kind of sad.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   I did see last year I got very excited about a MEMS sensor that Bosch had built that allowed you to project something on, on to a, let's see, on to a counter and you could actually interact with it.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   And I saw that in person.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   They turned it into a projector product and it was super cool.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   I think I tweeted out or we put it on our Instagram account of the, the, it was dividing up cake slices for me and it would do things like if you stuck like a piece of meat in front of it or food, it would identify it.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   So you like push the cake under its camera and then it projects the slice where you should slice it?
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   Yeah, and then you can run a little slide, it has a slider on the bottom and you run the slider and it goes like more, more slices.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   Oh, that's clever.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   If you go to my Twitter, but I do it.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   You can, you, you, what, what, what, you need AI slices?
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   No, no, no, no, no, that calm yourself, my friend.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   So what this does is this is just a new way to interact with something and what they're showing off is when you can project information down and then also interact with it.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   It opens up a new user interface, just like voice, right?
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   So let's see, if you go to my Twitter account and I've noticed on your meeting through it.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   This was day two, I think, yes.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   Yeah, but you should be able, if you just go to my media.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   You know, looking at your Twitter account, it looked like there was a lot, there is, this cool.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   Looks like there was a lot of cool stuff, actually.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   This is nice.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   So what does this have to do with MEMS?
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   How is that?
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   And how expensive is it?
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   So the MEMS is the light that is projecting down.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   It's, it's a new way the...
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   MEMS is microelectric mechanical machines, electromechanical machines.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   They're very, very, very tiny.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   They're not nano, but they're tiny mechanical machines.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   There's MEMS in our June ovens in the, in the feet to weigh the...
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   MEMS are, I always tell people that MEMS are a way to translate the analog world to digital.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   So they're basically, you take a silicon wafer and then you put something that's going to measure analogs.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   It's like a...
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   Your accelerometer is a MEMS in your phone.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   And then it talks to the rest of your electronics.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   So that's, that's what a MEMS is.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   So, but what they did is, is it, it's just a new type of projector that when you, you can change the focal distance.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   And it, it responds automatically.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   And then it also can measure when something disturbs the light field.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   And that is a cue to interact with it.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   And to be honest, I don't think this is really destined for the kitchen.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   I could see this in a lot of industrial applications though.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   You could. I could see it in the kitchen.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   So the cake example is fun, but think about something like, if I put a steak on there or better yet,
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   like a fish and I said, Hey, hey, Gee, how do I debone this fish?
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   Right.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   And then it can print, not print, it can show instructions.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   Onto the fish.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   Or my screen that I'm using to like work my recipe, I don't want that to get dirty with my fingerprints.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   So I can just tap the counter, which sometimes is easier when I'm dealing with like a recipe than, you know, maybe...
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   Hey, Stacey, how long does it take to get the program for a CES visit?
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   People who come back from CES are often a little like, like...
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   No, I was excited about this last year.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   So seeing it in real, like they turned it into an actual product.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   That was a big deal.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   This is one of the few things I'm super excited about.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   For the most part, I was really disappointed in...
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   We didn't see a lot of awesome integrations in the smart home.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   So...
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   That's been the, in annual disappointment for at least two decades.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   Okay.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   Right.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   You did see a lot of Wi-Fi smart home devices.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   So instead of ZigBee or Z-Wave, so we're looking at going hubless and Amazon and Google are definitely in everything.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   There are a lot more health products that I think of them as digital snake oil for the most part.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   But some of them were actually really neat.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   We were talking about the Sun Tuit, but there were some devices that...
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   What was the bladder device that was happening?
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   There was this device that measured health...
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   Father Robert was wearing it during Tuit on Sunday.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   At one point...
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   We dosed him...
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   What's it called, Karsten?
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   The D-Free.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   The D-Free.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   It's that little ultrasonic patch you put on your belly and then on your smartphone tells you how full your bladder is.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   Towards the end of the show, we got tired of waiting.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   So we gave him a couple of liters of water and man, it went to 10.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   And he ran.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   I said, "You gotta go?"
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   He said, "Yeah!"
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   He ran out of here.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   It works.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   It's not...
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   I mean, we all know if we have to pee, but it's for people who don't.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   There are many people who for what variety of reasons can't sense that.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   And that can be really a source of social embarrassment and undiscovered.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   So this is, I think, a really cool example.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   That's an example of miniaturization of existing technologies.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   And the...
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   And the smartphone.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   And the advantage of the fact that we are all carrying supercomputers in our pockets.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   Well, and there were some diagnostic things and I wish...
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   I feel like we need more peer-reviewed articles like analyzing algorithms, right?
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   And they probably should be come to market a little faster.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   The research should proceed a little faster because I saw a lot of things that are like,
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   "Hey, we can personalize this algorithm to help stop your headaches or help you eat less or you know,
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   prevent jet lag."
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   And they all sounded really fascinating and like it might be possible, but they also kind of sounded like,
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   again, digital snake oil.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   So I really was like...
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   So I saw a lot of that, but I would like to see like, I guess a change in how we review that kind of stuff.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   Well, it is a bit of a carnival, right?
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   And the good reporters like you who know what they're doing can contain the data.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   Can contextualize what they're seeing, throw out the trash of which, you know,
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   there's the majority of the stuff is trash and find some interesting things.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   It sounds like you did that.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   I tried.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   I didn't walk away with any like super interesting things.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   So I was a little...
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   I mean...
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   I feel like that every year it's a little, you know...
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   Hey, you keep up on...
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   You see, but you're ahead of CES.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   Right.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   That is true.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   So you know what's happening before...
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   By the time it arrives at CES, you know about it.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   Well, but sometimes I see things that I don't know about.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   That's what I go for.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   Of course, everybody wants to see as a realer.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   It's rare.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   You...
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   I think that's a very good point, Jeff.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   You go to CES to expect to be surprised, but if you've been following tech,
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   you know, it's going to be the manifestation of stuff you've been reading about for some time.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   Oh, and there was lots of...
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   Go ahead.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   Oh, I was going to say, oh, and there was lots of 5G stuff that wasn't 5G stuff.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   What do you think of that?
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   8T&T putting the E on the end of 5G and saying on all of their phones that are really connected
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   to LGE, oh, you've got 5GE.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   They did that.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   So as a veteran 8T&T watcher, they did that actually with HSPA plus.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   I remember that.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   And LTE.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   I remember that.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   So they called HSPA plus, which is like technically 3.5G.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   And they called it LTE or 4G.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   They called it 4G, not LTE.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   Right.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   So this does not surprise me.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   And, you know, the world does not come to an end.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   No.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   It's just marketing.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   Well, I tell you why I don't like it for two reasons.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   One, there are a lot of people who think they have 5G phones and say, well, this isn't that great.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   Which is what happened with HSPA plus.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   And two, it's lying.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   So it has fraud with a negative impact.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   I guess, you know, welcome to the United States of America, boys and girls.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   Well, you could complain to the FDA, except there's shut down.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   FTC, FCC, they're all.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   Oh, not FDA.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   Sorry.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   Yes.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   You go complain to all of them.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   Nobody will answer.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   They're not there.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   We had somebody in from the EPA on Tuesday yesterday who was on furlough.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   And I said, I'm just really sorry.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   He says, well, we're all right.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   I guess he has savings.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   He's a reference librarian for the EPA.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   And I said, I just feel.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   And so, and I would extend that to anybody who watches our shows who's on furlough.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   Or work worse working and not getting paid.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   I looked at the salary of a TSA agent is something like $17 an hour.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   There's no way they can have savings.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   Have a family and works protect us.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   It does.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   It really does.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   And they're in there working.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   It's just it's just criminal.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   So say thank you when you're traveling.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   Oh, you know, I think that's a really good idea.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   Did you?
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   Well, what I'm hearing is people are doing that.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   Yes.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   Thank you for working and keeping us safe, even though, you know, in most cases, they get paid
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   later.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   We should point out.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   Yeah, but they, but they may not be able to pay their mortgage or their, or their, or their.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   Can't tell you, you can't tell your landlord.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.760]   I'll pay you when I get paid or, yeah, or their child care because they have to have two
[00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:48.000]   jobs and they pay, pay is so crappy.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   There's no, no empathy here for them.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   No respect from just tough.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   It's really tough.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.760]   Well, it sounds like you came away.
[00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:59.000]   How many, do you go to CES?
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   Have you been going a lot?
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:06.560]   I've been to the last five years, but before that, I avoided it because I was, I was again,
[00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:08.840]   deeply nerdy tech and that's not where CES is.
[00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:11.320]   - There is deeply nerdy tech in the basement.
[00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:14.640]   - Sorry, there is in Urika Park,
[00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:16.480]   although you have to,
[00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:19.360]   what is it, filtered through a lot of chaff?
[00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:20.520]   - Yeah.
[00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:22.080]   - So, speaking of chaff,
[00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:24.100]   I spent a lot of time with a giant combine.
[00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:24.940]   That was fun.
[00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:28.720]   And you talked to Geoffrey Dier about their new AI,
[00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:29.700]   your camera stuff. - I love this.
[00:13:29.700 --> 00:13:31.340]   Oh.
[00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:32.940]   - Look at that. - Yeah, that was fun.
[00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:34.880]   - That is a combine harvester.
[00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:36.960]   So, what was it, Cybercorn?
[00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:40.800]   - You can actually, so it's designed just for harvesting.
[00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:42.160]   You can do soybeans. - Multi, multi-tint.
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:44.600]   - Yeah, 'cause you don't, yeah, you just,
[00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:47.080]   but they can actually now tweak the algorithm.
[00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:49.600]   So, you download the software or the algorithms
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:52.000]   for the crop that you are cutting.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.180]   And it optimizes for that.
[00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:55.840]   And what happens is they have a camera
[00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:57.920]   kind of on the facing the back.
[00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:02.920]   And they've got an AI that detects too much debris
[00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:04.420]   coming in.
[00:14:04.420 --> 00:14:06.440]   And what it does is when it sees too much debris
[00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:09.960]   in your grains or soybeans,
[00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:13.520]   it automatically starts changing like the filters
[00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:15.200]   and the sieves and the shaking
[00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:17.320]   and everything else to get it cleaner.
[00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:20.080]   And beforehand, the farmer used to have to look behind them
[00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:23.080]   and kind of just see what the grain was looking like.
[00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:26.560]   And then they would manually adjust all that.
[00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:28.960]   So, it's actually really neat.
[00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:31.240]   - I have to say, of all the coverage of CES,
[00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:34.480]   I enjoyed yours the most because you did seek out
[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:38.320]   and find stuff that, it's not everybody else
[00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:41.240]   is talking about stuff.
[00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:42.400]   So, this is good. - Yeah, I'll do.
[00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:43.840]   - You did a good job.
[00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:46.520]   - No floating, televeried, not floating, folding television.
[00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:48.720]   - Yeah, but, you know, that's not, to me,
[00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:49.960]   that's not that exciting,
[00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:52.200]   especially since they showed it last year.
[00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:53.040]   - Yeah, well.
[00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:56.240]   - So, how sore are your feet, Stacey?
[00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:59.160]   What are your Stacey tricks for doing CES?
[00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:01.880]   - You know, I bring, I bring up some salts,
[00:15:01.880 --> 00:15:03.640]   or I just, actually this year I didn't go bring them.
[00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:06.920]   I brought a little, you bring a little bit of peppermint oil,
[00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:11.000]   and then you put it in, you buy some Epsom salts
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   when you get there and at night you just soak your feet
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.040]   in the tub with Epsom salts and peppermint oil
[00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:16.440]   and you feel amazing.
[00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:18.720]   - Is there anything peppermint oil can't do?
[00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:21.760]   I love peppermint oil.
[00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:23.400]   - You can use it to stop ants.
[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:26.160]   We discovered that when we had little bugs in our--
[00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:29.040]   - And it makes your house smell minty fresh.
[00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:30.040]   - Like Christmas.
[00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:35.600]   - Did you, all right, so there was a, reportedly, again,
[00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:38.480]   Jeff and I weren't there, but reportedly a battle
[00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:40.920]   between the voice assistants, Amazon's Echo,
[00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:42.520]   Google's assistant.
[00:15:42.520 --> 00:15:45.280]   Can you declare a winner?
[00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:48.520]   - Oh, we talked about this too.
[00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:51.240]   So, apologies if you heard me say this before,
[00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:52.440]   but my opinion is the same.
[00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:55.920]   Google spent a lot, they were the up-and-comer,
[00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:58.480]   so they needed to convince people they were awesome.
[00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:01.000]   - You ride the cool ride.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.560]   Kevin did, I did not.
[00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:05.760]   I actually did a podcast interview under the Google ride,
[00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:09.280]   which I cannot use because it was so loud.
[00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:11.960]   - Jeff, just for your edification,
[00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:16.560]   Google made a virtual reality version
[00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:18.560]   of the assistant ride.
[00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:20.720]   So you can-- - It's a small, small Google.
[00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:21.720]   - Yeah.
[00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:24.200]   - So Stacy, you said that there's a theme to it.
[00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:25.720]   You're trying to do something?
[00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:28.880]   - Oh yes, you're trying to get a cake
[00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:30.720]   for grandma's birthday.
[00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:34.960]   - Okay, so you're riding these little cars
[00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:37.800]   and there is that goofy--
[00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:40.480]   - Liz is tooth-based in her hand.
[00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:41.320]   - Music.
[00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:44.280]   And it really does look like it's a small,
[00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:45.800]   it's a very Disney ride.
[00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:50.280]   And this is where, was this in the parking lot?
[00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:54.360]   - So the Google booth was in the parking lot
[00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:58.360]   right next to the BMW booth or the NXP booth.
[00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:01.720]   So right out in front of LV Las Vegas Convention Center
[00:17:01.720 --> 00:17:04.080]   and it was pretty sizable.
[00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:06.320]   And this was kind of on top of-- - There was not a Disneyland.
[00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:08.760]   Sorry. - No, that's okay.
[00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:09.600]   - And what is this-- - If it were not
[00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:11.000]   a Disneyland, Google would make it.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:13.880]   Imagine Google today.
[00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:16.080]   - Google's surveillance Disneyland.
[00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:17.640]   - Oh geez.
[00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:19.960]   We know what ride you wanna go on next.
[00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:22.360]   (laughing)
[00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:25.880]   - Disney has some excellent technology actually.
[00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:28.720]   - I mean, Fast Pass is amazing.
[00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:32.680]   Is it Fast Pass or their little ID card things?
[00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:36.040]   Carnival actually just put that on their cruises
[00:17:36.040 --> 00:17:38.000]   about a year and a half ago.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.400]   And that's, I don't know if anyone in the chat room
[00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:42.520]   or anyone listening has taken a Carnival Cruise,
[00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:46.080]   but that is actually something I wanna investigate further.
[00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:50.080]   - Yeah, just take a cruise, don't worry about the technology.
[00:17:50.080 --> 00:17:51.440]   - Sorry, you get your drinks.
[00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:53.440]   - We were on Anthem and the Seas a couple of years ago,
[00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:54.280]   they had a lot of this.
[00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:56.480]   It was a brand new boat and a lot of this,
[00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:58.280]   you download an app for the ship,
[00:17:58.280 --> 00:17:59.440]   it tells you what you're doing
[00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:01.000]   and you use it to get into stuff.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.560]   And I-- - So yeah,
[00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:04.280]   this one has a wrist bracelet
[00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:05.840]   and when you walk by things
[00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:08.600]   that personalize the screens for you,
[00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:11.560]   it also lets you, you know, you can tap a button
[00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:14.240]   or something on it and it will call a server to you
[00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:16.480]   and that's how you can order drinks and that sort of thing.
[00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:19.480]   - You need to because there's 5,000 people on that boat
[00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:22.120]   and if you don't wear the wristband,
[00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:23.880]   nobody's gonna talk to you.
[00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:26.200]   - All right,
[00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:29.520]   see, sometimes I'm thinking,
[00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:31.120]   I'm turning into a Luddite Jeff.
[00:18:31.120 --> 00:18:35.040]   - I'm, yes. - Yes.
[00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:36.840]   - You have? - Yes.
[00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:39.520]   So one of the battles was that Battle of the Numbers,
[00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:42.040]   'cause right before CES, Amazon announced
[00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:44.720]   that they had 100 million Echo devices
[00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:47.800]   and then Google just kinda said, well, we got a billion.
[00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:50.160]   And of course, because of all the Android phones,
[00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:52.600]   they're always gonna be ahead in that regard.
[00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:55.800]   - But the Google experience is not great.
[00:18:55.800 --> 00:18:58.960]   My pro tip for everyone trying to deal with Google,
[00:18:58.960 --> 00:18:59.880]   it may be it's just me.
[00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:03.040]   I'm like, I turned off the voice match, voice recognition.
[00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:04.040]   I've turned off all the screen.
[00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:05.320]   - Oh, yeah, you were really, yeah,
[00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:07.240]   that was not working for you.
[00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:08.120]   - No, and it's still there.
[00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:09.600]   - You were complaining about that, I saw that.
[00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:11.040]   - Yeah.
[00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:14.120]   - 'Cause I love it in the bathroom.
[00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:16.480]   Love it, oh, we should talk about bathroom tech.
[00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:19.560]   Yeah, so I was trying to call my husband
[00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:21.600]   while I was putting on my makeup for the show,
[00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:23.120]   'cause multitasking.
[00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:26.080]   And it was just like, I cannot have access to your contacts
[00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:28.520]   until you validate your voice.
[00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:30.520]   And I'm like, (growling)
[00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:31.680]   - Yeah.
[00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:35.080]   What I thought was maybe even a bigger story at CES was finally,
[00:19:35.080 --> 00:19:36.480]   some of the barriers coming down,
[00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:38.320]   Google Apps are coming to Bixby.
[00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:40.640]   Samsung made deals with Apple as well.
[00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:43.840]   Apple's gonna have iTunes and Samsung TVs
[00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:46.000]   as well as Sony and other TVs.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.480]   So some of the Google Assistant will be coming
[00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:50.760]   to Samsung TVs.
[00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:55.800]   Some of the walls are breaking down, which is interesting.
[00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:59.200]   I'm not sure if that's co-opetition at this point,
[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:01.000]   that it's still too small a market
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:02.960]   for anybody to worry about it.
[00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:04.560]   - There was a lot of talk about money changing.
[00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:09.560]   Somebody mentioned that Apple paid to get iTunes
[00:20:09.560 --> 00:20:13.360]   on certain TVs, which I thought was really interesting.
[00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:16.760]   And then Samsung, it makes sense because Bixby is nowhere.
[00:20:16.760 --> 00:20:17.800]   - No.
[00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:20.360]   - I think both Samsung and Microsoft have kind of given up
[00:20:20.360 --> 00:20:21.680]   on their voice assistants.
[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:25.520]   - I think Cortana could have a place in the enterprise,
[00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:28.480]   especially if Microsoft figures out the kind of problems
[00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:30.520]   that Google's having right now with like,
[00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:33.000]   basically it's an admin rights issue.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.920]   It's an admin and identification issue.
[00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:38.280]   So if you could do that and it would be helpful,
[00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:41.240]   there was a company actually right before CES,
[00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:42.640]   it's called PinDrop.
[00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:44.960]   They got a lot of money funding,
[00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:47.120]   and they're an older company.
[00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:49.960]   They did voice identification in the financial industry
[00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:52.920]   and for like call centers,
[00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:54.480]   but they're not pivoting,
[00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:56.880]   but they're opening a new market for voice.
[00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:59.920]   And so for all of voice control,
[00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:03.920]   having reliable and good voice identification
[00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:05.280]   could be awesome.
[00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:06.400]   So look for them.
[00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:09.960]   - I'm gonna show you a little connected device
[00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:11.960]   that is a new sponsor on the show.
[00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:14.800]   And that is this ring that you've probably seen me wearing
[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:18.000]   for the last few months, it's called an Aura Ring,
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.240]   Aura is a brand new sponsor on the network.
[00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:22.640]   We had them on the new screensavers.
[00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:25.480]   Preak came by to show us what they were up to.
[00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:27.440]   I first found out about Aura from Kevin Rose,
[00:21:27.440 --> 00:21:29.320]   who is an advisor to Aura.
[00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:31.640]   He arranged for a pre-dissemium,
[00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:32.840]   one of these rings and I've been wearing it,
[00:21:32.840 --> 00:21:34.800]   I think it must be six months now.
[00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:39.600]   The Aura Ring is the most accurate sleep and activity tracker
[00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:42.840]   because it's on your finger.
[00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:46.640]   It can sense my heart rate, of course.
[00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:48.520]   It tells me heart rate variability,
[00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:51.200]   which is a very interesting statistic.
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:52.680]   You want your heart rate variability,
[00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:54.640]   that's the amount of time in between beats
[00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:56.520]   to be high, not low.
[00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:57.760]   So when you're doing well,
[00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:01.000]   it will give you an actual number saying,
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   "Hey, you're 89 today, go get 'em."
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.920]   Or you're 62 today,
[00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:06.680]   based on heart rate variability, sleep,
[00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:08.920]   all activity, all the things that happened yesterday,
[00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:10.040]   take it a little bit easy.
[00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:12.000]   It is really fantastic.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.840]   It gives you insight into what's going on
[00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:17.880]   with your sleep, with your motion.
[00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:20.440]   It's got an infrared optical pulse measurement system
[00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:22.880]   with a 3D accelerometer gyroscope
[00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:24.680]   and body temperature sensor.
[00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:27.360]   All in this little ring, you get insights into this.
[00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:28.800]   - This is so cool.
[00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:32.440]   - And the thing is, I don't wanna wear a watch to bed.
[00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:33.800]   It's just a nice looking ring.
[00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:36.720]   They have a variety of, they have titanium,
[00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:38.280]   it's made of titanium.
[00:22:38.280 --> 00:22:40.240]   It has a diamond hard carbon coating.
[00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:44.240]   So I wear this everywhere, hot tub, bathtub, shower,
[00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:46.520]   swimming, I don't ever have to take it off.
[00:22:46.520 --> 00:22:48.240]   - How does it charge?
[00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:49.640]   - It has a little charger,
[00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:52.080]   but you only have to charge it once a week.
[00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:54.840]   What I do is, when I take a shower,
[00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:56.560]   I'll pop it on for a few minutes.
[00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:58.560]   I've never had an issue with charging at all.
[00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:00.080]   So it's got a little thing,
[00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:01.640]   I'll show you, it has a little base
[00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:04.160]   that you put it on, the base looks like this,
[00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:05.600]   and that's plugged into USB,
[00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:06.880]   and then the ring goes on that.
[00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:10.400]   And it connects and syncs using Bluetooth LE.
[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:11.600]   And by the way, I wanna point this out,
[00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:15.600]   as a Finnish company, they are GDPR compliant.
[00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:17.760]   Read their privacy policy.
[00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:22.040]   They understand that health data is very personal,
[00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:26.040]   and they are really good about protecting your personal data.
[00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:27.280]   So read the privacy policy.
[00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:29.000]   I think it'd be gratified part of that
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.080]   is because they're in Finland, they have to, right?
[00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:33.320]   Let's see, this is the one I have.
[00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:35.360]   This is, oh, that's nice, it's titanium.
[00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:37.080]   It's got the sensors on the inside.
[00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:38.320]   Let me show you Karsten.
[00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:40.240]   Let me show everybody where the sensors are.
[00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:41.520]   They're right in here.
[00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:42.880]   You might say, oh, that looks--
[00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:44.040]   - This is a ball bearing.
[00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:46.080]   - Yeah, and it's very comfortable.
[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:48.840]   And it can store data for up to six weeks.
[00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:51.520]   So once every six weeks you pair it to the phone,
[00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:52.680]   it's actually so quick and easy.
[00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:55.960]   There's the phone interface that I pair it every day,
[00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:57.640]   'cause I wanna know how my sleep was last night.
[00:23:57.640 --> 00:24:00.520]   It is never 92.
[00:24:00.520 --> 00:24:03.920]   I wish it were, but it's very helpful,
[00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:05.320]   'cause it gives me insights.
[00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:07.440]   For instance, it says, on days you exercise,
[00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:10.040]   you get an average of 30 minutes more deep sleep,
[00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:12.600]   things like that, which is very interesting.
[00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:14.840]   The Aura app is free for iOS and Android.
[00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:16.200]   It comes, it's updated regularly.
[00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:18.360]   As is the ring, it gets firmware updates.
[00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:20.800]   And by the way, it works if you have an iPhone,
[00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:22.520]   it works with Apple's Health app.
[00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:25.360]   So it will import workouts from health.
[00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:27.520]   So that's very nice, although you can also indicate
[00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:30.080]   workouts in the app.
[00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:32.600]   The daily feedback really helps you better understand
[00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:34.320]   everything that's going on with your body,
[00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:36.560]   your health, your sleep, and to reach your goals.
[00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:41.560]   Now Aura is O-U-R-A, O-U-R-A.
[00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:45.000]   The number of the insights is very deep on the app.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.480]   Track your sleep in a way that nothing else can do
[00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:51.040]   because it's on your body, it's got the temperature,
[00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:53.160]   it's got the heart rate, it's got motion.
[00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:56.400]   Make the most of your day, AuraRing.com.
[00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:57.680]   They'll send you a free sciser
[00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:00.880]   so you can pick the size that fits you the best.
[00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:02.840]   Now, I have the bad, this is all good news.
[00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:06.360]   The bad news is, since they were on Twitch
[00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:09.720]   a couple of months ago, they're crazy sold out.
[00:25:09.720 --> 00:25:11.800]   They're cracking them out as fast as they can.
[00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:15.120]   You'll need to order now if you wanna get your ring by April.
[00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:17.240]   Okay, we are though, because of that,
[00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:20.280]   gonna give you $50 off at checkout
[00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:22.240]   if you use the off-code Twitch.
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:25.120]   $2.99 for silver or black $3.99 for stealth.
[00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:26.560]   Lisa wants the diamond.
[00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:29.240]   - What does diamond? - That's just how much money.
[00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:30.560]   It's the most expensive one, of course.
[00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:31.800]   $2,000.
[00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:32.960]   - Yeah. - She's holding out
[00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:33.880]   for the diamond.
[00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:34.720]   - Although, I'm looking at the picture,
[00:25:34.720 --> 00:25:38.720]   I think you're right, the shiny black now takes my heart forward.
[00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:39.720]   - Here's the silver one too,
[00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:42.160]   let me show you the shiny, crumish silver one.
[00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:43.680]   - Oh, that's true. - They're very pretty.
[00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:45.080]   And by the way, I can say, I've been wearing it
[00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:48.320]   for six months, get it wet, I never take it off.
[00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:49.800]   It wears beautifully, it's titanium,
[00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:51.760]   it's very light, weighs nothing.
[00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:53.720]   So you won't mind wearing it,
[00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:55.640]   and I tell you what the insights you get,
[00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:57.000]   you've never seen anything like this.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.840]   I wear an Apple Watch, I have a variety of sleep trackers
[00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:02.120]   and other devices, you'll never see anything like this.
[00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:05.120]   This is the best because it's right on your body.
[00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:08.880]   And so, if you haven't had a gadget envy for quite a while,
[00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:10.600]   this one, this is good. - Oh, I'm glad you like it.
[00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:12.560]   This is good, let me check. - Let me check.
[00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:15.400]   - I think we'll get one sent out to you in Stacey
[00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:17.040]   that way you can try it.
[00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:19.880]   - Well, I wasn't fishing, but I think we'd like to send you one.
[00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:24.880]   Yeah, O-U-R-A, Aura, Ring.com, the offer code TWIT,
[00:26:24.880 --> 00:26:28.040]   we'll get you $50 off, but a reminder,
[00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:30.480]   you're ordering now for delivery in April.
[00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:31.960]   Took me a few months to get mine too,
[00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:33.680]   and it was worth it though.
[00:26:33.680 --> 00:26:35.600]   And these last, I was really impressed
[00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:38.600]   because I beat the heck out of this thing.
[00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:41.520]   I mean, I never take it off, so it's getting banged around,
[00:26:41.520 --> 00:26:44.440]   it's, I mean, hot tub shower bath,
[00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:46.480]   you don't have to, swimming.
[00:26:46.480 --> 00:26:47.920]   - Regular hand washing?
[00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:50.600]   - Oh, I wash my hands incessantly.
[00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:52.640]   - I am teasing. - No, it's true.
[00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:53.640]   I get so-- - I don't want to hear
[00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:54.480]   about the hot tub, but.
[00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:57.760]   - Yeah, it works in the hot tub too.
[00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:01.440]   Wow, Google shifted $23 billion
[00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:07.160]   to a tax haven in Bermuda in 2017.
[00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:10.400]   So this offshore, I mean, it's not illegal,
[00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:13.800]   but remember that they were trying to get the money
[00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:16.680]   repatriated the new tax act last year
[00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:19.760]   was supposedly gonna bring a lot of this money back, guess not.
[00:27:19.760 --> 00:27:24.360]   It was, this is another one of those Dutch sandwiches
[00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:28.160]   sent it from a Dutch shell company to Bermuda in 2017.
[00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:30.720]   It reduces, of course, its foreign tax bill.
[00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:35.240]   Google says we pay all of the taxes due
[00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:36.600]   and comply with the tax laws
[00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:39.040]   in every country we operate in around the world.
[00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:40.520]   - As a Google shareholder,
[00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:43.440]   they are following their fiduciary responsibility to me.
[00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:46.160]   - Yes, to minimize tax, maximize profit.
[00:27:46.160 --> 00:27:47.000]   - Okay, here's the point.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:49.440]   - If you don't like it, if you don't like it,
[00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:51.440]   you shouldn't, you shouldn't-- - Change the laws.
[00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:53.680]   - You gotta change the law, you gotta write to Congress.
[00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:58.680]   But the point is to me, you're free writing on a society,
[00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:05.200]   I mean, the roads, the infrastructure,
[00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:09.640]   it's Google's tremendously profitable as is Apple and Facebook.
[00:28:09.640 --> 00:28:12.600]   You also need to do your share,
[00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:13.960]   not merely inventing new price,
[00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:16.080]   but do your share in your tax burden.
[00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:18.920]   I do, we do, we don't have the resources to have it.
[00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:19.760]   - But you don't want them to be--
[00:28:19.760 --> 00:28:20.600]   - Dutch sand, which-- - Here's the problem
[00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:21.720]   with this argument.
[00:28:21.720 --> 00:28:24.960]   You do not want a company deciding how much tax it should pay.
[00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:27.800]   - No, no, no, no, no, no, the government needs to do it.
[00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:29.440]   So I agree, there should be taxed more,
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:30.360]   but that is the government's job.
[00:28:30.360 --> 00:28:34.800]   I had a guardian debate with a UK MP about this,
[00:28:34.800 --> 00:28:36.600]   where she's complaining about it, and I said, "Madam,
[00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:38.080]   it's your job."
[00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:38.920]   - Yeah, yeah, change the rules.
[00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:41.400]   - And if it's either legislation or also diplomacy,
[00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:42.920]   if you don't like what the double Dutch sand,
[00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:45.020]   which is, go complain to the Dutch.
[00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:49.640]   - Yep, and the US, 'cause they're a US company.
[00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:52.600]   So I knew you'd like this one,
[00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:54.000]   and I'm curious what you think about it.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.320]   We talked about it yesterday.
[00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:57.000]   Google is working with WordPress,
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.080]   one of our sponsors, WordPress.com,
[00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:01.280]   to do a new,
[00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:04.960]   news publishing platform.
[00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:07.520]   - This is pretty cool, Newspack,
[00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:09.600]   which has backing from Google and others.
[00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:12.600]   I forget who else is in on this,
[00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:15.200]   but Google gave some money to it, to create,
[00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:19.520]   the funny thing about the news industry and CMSs,
[00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:22.320]   I don't think I told the story on the show before,
[00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:23.600]   but when I was in the Chicago Tribune,
[00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:24.800]   I wanna date myself terribly.
[00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:25.920]   Stacey, I don't know what I know,
[00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:27.440]   how far away from birth you were,
[00:29:27.440 --> 00:29:30.040]   in the early '70s.
[00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:35.000]   And every newspaper thought they were special,
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.200]   and they had to have their own CMS,
[00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:37.200]   and their own functionality,
[00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:40.640]   and the CMS we had at the Chicago Tribune was so terrible,
[00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:44.400]   they assigned their Pulitzer Prize-winning task force
[00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:47.200]   of investigative journalists to investigate their CMS.
[00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:50.600]   And that's been the history and our industry
[00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:51.680]   from the beginning.
[00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:53.040]   We think we're special.
[00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:54.400]   All we do is make paragraphs.
[00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:56.040]   They're paragraphs, you can make them.
[00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:59.160]   So now WordPress, which is what,
[00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:01.320]   like 30% of the entire web, every page on the web.
[00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:04.160]   - 33%, according to their last ad.
[00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:08.120]   - They're something that is targeted toward news,
[00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:09.920]   and I argued years ago that Google showed up on this,
[00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:11.360]   they should've brought all their tools,
[00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:13.160]   this is when they bought Blogger and all those things,
[00:30:13.160 --> 00:30:14.560]   they could've done it years ago,
[00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:15.640]   but they were gun shy about this.
[00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:16.960]   So instead of supporting WordPress,
[00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:18.840]   WordPress is a great company,
[00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:22.000]   and they're gonna bring a product that's gonna work for
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:23.360]   news sites, and there is a charge.
[00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:25.280]   I think it's like $1,000 a month, it's not much,
[00:30:25.280 --> 00:30:26.120]   but it's not free.
[00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:27.480]   - Well, but what they're also true.
[00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:28.320]   - Oh, it's a good CMS.
[00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:31.840]   - Is there inviting people to participate
[00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:34.680]   kind of in a scholarship process?
[00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:39.080]   So the other groups are the Len Fest Institute for Journalism,
[00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:42.280]   the Knight Foundation, you should've remembered that, Jeff.
[00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:43.120]   - Yes, I should have.
[00:30:43.120 --> 00:30:44.760]   - The Toward Knights Center.
[00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:46.320]   - Well, it's John S. and James L. Knight.
[00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:47.160]   That's the same?
[00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:48.000]   - The same Knight.
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:48.840]   - Yep, same Knight.
[00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:51.000]   - And civil media, each giving one million,
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.360]   Google giving one point two million,
[00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:58.360]   and so News Pack is basically a version of WordPress,
[00:30:58.360 --> 00:31:01.600]   tailored to low cost publishing,
[00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:02.880]   the needs of small newsrooms.
[00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:03.960]   Is that, is that?
[00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:05.600]   - Yeah, that's pretty much it.
[00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:07.680]   Yeah, because you have for big newsrooms now,
[00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:10.520]   the Washington Post CMS is taking off.
[00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:12.760]   Advance is using it.
[00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:13.600]   - That's a true thing.
[00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:16.200]   - The use of the big end.
[00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:18.400]   I've not used that, I don't know, but people love it.
[00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:21.600]   And it has a lot of the smarts and ability
[00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:25.320]   that Bezos has brought to the post.
[00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:27.200]   So that's happening at the big end.
[00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:29.480]   The little guys need help.
[00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:32.120]   And so this is great.
[00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:34.920]   I'm delighted that all the parties are doing this.
[00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:38.160]   - So it's News Pack dot blog.
[00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:40.800]   You can apply if you'd like.
[00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:44.880]   There's an application form due February 1st
[00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:46.640]   for basically a scholarship.
[00:31:46.640 --> 00:31:49.000]   The effort will be funded by automatic
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:50.840]   through the development period after that operating fees
[00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:52.800]   of a thousand a month to two thousand a month
[00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:54.680]   will be applied to participating sites.
[00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:57.520]   So you get to go through January 2020 to the--
[00:31:57.520 --> 00:31:59.800]   - So Stacy, would you do this?
[00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:00.640]   - I don't know.
[00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:02.320]   I have a WordPress blog.
[00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:04.840]   I'm not producing news.
[00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:05.840]   So--
[00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:08.400]   - It's more for a newsroom, I would guess, then.
[00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:09.240]   - Yeah.
[00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:11.320]   - Yeah, it's already streamlined to my process.
[00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:13.400]   'Cause I used to hate like,
[00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:17.280]   you know, every reporter who deals with internet stuff now,
[00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:19.280]   like you write your paragraphs,
[00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:21.640]   as Jeff so cutely calls it.
[00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:23.080]   You have your headline.
[00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:25.240]   You're also responsible for getting your art,
[00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:26.880]   which used to not be the case.
[00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:28.880]   You have to write the caption under your art.
[00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:31.280]   Then you have to write your tags,
[00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:33.880]   any optimization, SEO optimization
[00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:35.440]   that you're supposed to be doing.
[00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:38.440]   And then there's usually some other form of optimization
[00:32:38.440 --> 00:32:43.440]   that is special to your particular site or newsroom.
[00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:47.480]   And I mean, to get up a news article can take,
[00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:49.200]   I mean, to fill in all those things,
[00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:52.160]   even if you're like really amaze balls at writing
[00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:54.600]   quickly like an earning story or something,
[00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:58.240]   I mean, oh, it was a pain there.
[00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:00.080]   - At Gigalme, you used WordPress, didn't you?
[00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:00.920]   What was Gigalme?
[00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:01.760]   - Yeah.
[00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:03.440]   - Gigalme was WordPress, Fortune was WordPress.
[00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:04.280]   - Yeah.
[00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:05.280]   - Yeah, major newspapers were using
[00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:07.000]   of you as WordPress and moveable type
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:09.240]   in advance, we were on moveable type at the end.
[00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:12.280]   Yeah, there's a pain.
[00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:15.120]   You know, I, now when I post anything,
[00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:16.880]   I posted on my WordPress blog,
[00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:17.960]   but I also posted on media,
[00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:19.560]   I also posted on LinkedIn.
[00:33:19.560 --> 00:33:22.600]   - I actually explain CMS, somebody in the chat,
[00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:23.720]   I'm saying, what's that?
[00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:25.400]   It's a content management system.
[00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:26.400]   - Content management system.
[00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:29.320]   - And so blogging platforms are essentially
[00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:30.640]   content management systems.
[00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:34.600]   You type in a web window and press publish,
[00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:36.560]   and it will go to your blog.
[00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:37.960]   - Of course, if you're a newsroom,
[00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:40.520]   or you have a lot of reporters that gets more complicated,
[00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:42.480]   you know, you have, as Stacy said, lots of--
[00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:44.400]   - You have a copy flow, things to fill in.
[00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:45.240]   - Things to fill in.
[00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:46.080]   - Yeah, it has to go to people.
[00:33:46.080 --> 00:33:48.680]   - You know, we would just, we would write ours at Fortune,
[00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:50.920]   'cause at Gigalme, our copy flow was pretty much
[00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:52.760]   like you posted on Slack, and you're like,
[00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:54.160]   "Help me at it, please."
[00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:55.000]   (laughing)
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.880]   - That's a good flow, I like it.
[00:33:56.880 --> 00:34:00.680]   - We used Trello, actually, as our copy flow,
[00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:04.200]   which was really weird, but, you know, it's effective.
[00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:06.920]   I just wanna say that you just mentioned
[00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:08.760]   three Twitch sponsors.
[00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:09.600]   (laughing)
[00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:10.440]   - Oh, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
[00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:12.000]   - Which is great, no, no, it's great.
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:14.680]   Trello is Atlassian now, they got, they bought Trello.
[00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:15.520]   - Yes.
[00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:16.360]   - Oh.
[00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:18.080]   - Slack is a sponsor.
[00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:19.880]   WordPress.com is a sponsor.
[00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:21.920]   I think there was one more in there,
[00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:24.680]   but it just shows you that these tools
[00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:28.960]   are really the great tools to use for all this stuff.
[00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:30.280]   But-- - Are they the favorite tools
[00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:31.640]   of a dying industry, I'm not sure.
[00:34:31.640 --> 00:34:33.240]   (laughing)
[00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:34.680]   - I'm gonna add that to all the ads.
[00:34:34.680 --> 00:34:36.600]   - The favorite tools of a dying industry.
[00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:39.080]   (laughing)
[00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:40.120]   - Well-- - You know, I was thinking
[00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:41.760]   about your sponsors, Leo, I don't wanna go off here.
[00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:43.280]   - We have good sponsors, don't we?
[00:34:43.280 --> 00:34:46.000]   - You do, and I was thinking about your position
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   in being the early step in for direct response,
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.640]   direct a lot of the-- - Got a lot of startups.
[00:34:53.640 --> 00:34:55.080]   Like Ora. - A lot of those, right?
[00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:58.160]   So mattresses, razors, all this stuff, right?
[00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:00.920]   - I think Ora, we're the first advertising they've done,
[00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:02.640]   Helm, which is the mail server
[00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:03.600]   that's gonna be coming on,
[00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:05.680]   will be the first advertising they've done.
[00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:07.760]   - I'm also-- - You're brilliant on this.
[00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:10.440]   And so I saw, I was watching TV,
[00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:11.960]   and there was a, there was a,
[00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:13.400]   one, I hope it's not a sponsor,
[00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:16.360]   'cause I'm about to make fun of them a little bit.
[00:35:16.360 --> 00:35:18.720]   Well, by the way, let me just say
[00:35:18.720 --> 00:35:21.320]   that is part of our ethos, ethos also--
[00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:22.160]   - Is it if I do make fun of those?
[00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:24.640]   - Is that there's editorial and there's sponsorship.
[00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:26.840]   We pick sponsors we love, but we never let
[00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:29.960]   a sponsor's influence our content.
[00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:32.520]   - No, I've been here when you've criticized--
[00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:34.000]   - Yeah. - Products and things, yes.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.640]   So there was a new effort that would send you
[00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:39.200]   furnace filters.
[00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:42.280]   Like this is such a horrible pain in the butt.
[00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:44.000]   Once every two years you go to Home Depot
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:45.480]   and you buy a few furnace filters, right?
[00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:48.160]   So there's people in the commercial saying,
[00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:49.440]   "It's wonderful."
[00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:50.520]   - No, that is not what I'm wearing.
[00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:52.560]   - My fear. - Yeah.
[00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:56.320]   - It's just great as supposed to testimonials.
[00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:59.760]   And I'm thinking, man, everything on earth,
[00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:01.280]   everything is gonna be sent to you
[00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:02.680]   and in some monthly subscription.
[00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:04.480]   - Well, that's actually true. - I do have.
[00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:08.680]   - And having your sponsors, we just got butcher box,
[00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:10.680]   which sends you meat by mail.
[00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:12.840]   Half of our sponsors are about that,
[00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:15.800]   about making it so that you don't have to go out
[00:36:15.800 --> 00:36:17.320]   and acquire things.
[00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:18.960]   - Right, and you're the testing field for this.
[00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:22.520]   There's also, we ought to get you after Alexis O'Hadian
[00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:24.560]   'cause he's an investor in, what's the one
[00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:28.040]   that sends out the little blue pills to men?
[00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:29.480]   - Oh, get Roman.
[00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:30.320]   Roman, that's one of our--
[00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:32.840]   - That's one of our sponsors as well.
[00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:33.680]   - Okay.
[00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:38.440]   - Right, so Roman is solving ED and boldness
[00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:39.520]   and something else.
[00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:41.360]   - I debated whether we should do Roman
[00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:43.240]   'cause it's kind of an adult topic,
[00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:45.840]   but I think this is actually a really good thing.
[00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:48.080]   - It's good. - Okay, yeah, problems too, we men.
[00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:49.440]   - It's a really good thing.
[00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:53.240]   I have no problem doing theirs ads 'cause it, 'cause you know.
[00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:56.680]   - If we wanna talk about erectile dysfunction,
[00:36:56.680 --> 00:37:01.480]   why would we not show off ads for maybe menstrual cups
[00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:02.320]   or something like that?
[00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:03.160]   - I would do that.
[00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:04.400]   - Obviously, Twit is not a place for that.
[00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:07.080]   A lot of companies have a problem with showing
[00:37:07.080 --> 00:37:08.880]   a real depiction of,
[00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:13.320]   look at what happened actually with sex tech at CES.
[00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:15.280]   - Well, we talked about that last week, yes.
[00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:16.120]   - Yeah, so--
[00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:18.280]   - You know, it's not a hope but we did.
[00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:19.960]   (laughs)
[00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:21.760]   - We talked about how the vibrator got,
[00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:24.480]   their prize got revoked.
[00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:25.320]   - Which is unfortunate.
[00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:26.480]   - And there was their contention.
[00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:30.320]   - There's plenty of sexuality at CES as long as it's for men,
[00:37:30.320 --> 00:37:33.000]   it's okay, but as soon as it's female sexuality.
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.080]   - Oh no, we can't do that.
[00:37:35.080 --> 00:37:37.120]   - It has to be about health.
[00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:40.000]   - I agree and the truth is we're not gonna get those ads
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:42.840]   more because we have a predominantly male audience.
[00:37:42.840 --> 00:37:44.240]   - Ooh, I know.
[00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:45.320]   (laughs)
[00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:46.720]   - Do you know that?
[00:37:46.720 --> 00:37:50.280]   I'm not sure why I wanna know why you know that, but okay.
[00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:54.240]   But I would not object to that.
[00:37:54.240 --> 00:37:55.640]   You know what we don't do is E-6,
[00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:57.840]   we've been approached quite a few times by E-6.
[00:37:57.840 --> 00:38:00.640]   - I'm shocked that Sirius is advertising jewel.
[00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:01.560]   I'm shocked.
[00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:02.400]   I think it's awful.
[00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:03.840]   - I actually don't think it's awful,
[00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:06.280]   but I think it's awful to advertise to kids.
[00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:07.640]   - That's the problem you don't know who's listening.
[00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:09.720]   - My daughter, we had this conversation
[00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:11.720]   'cause my daughter smoked cigarettes.
[00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:12.560]   - Oh.
[00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:15.680]   - Which I know it's so sad because when she was young,
[00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:17.000]   she hated cigarette smoking so much,
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:18.600]   we actually had to fire a babysitter
[00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:20.440]   'cause she saw her walking down the street,
[00:38:20.440 --> 00:38:22.240]   not 'cause she smoked while she was babysitting,
[00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:24.080]   but she saw her smoking once and she said,
[00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:25.720]   well, she can't ever come back.
[00:38:25.720 --> 00:38:29.920]   And then she studied in high school in France for a year.
[00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:30.760]   - Yeah.
[00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:32.080]   - And that was it, it was all over.
[00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:34.920]   And she hates it, she wants to get off of it
[00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:37.040]   and she's gonna, but in the interim,
[00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:40.120]   I said, well, please jewel, that's better.
[00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:40.960]   But you know what?
[00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:42.840]   - You reduce the damage out there.
[00:38:42.840 --> 00:38:47.240]   - But the problem is there's such a resounding,
[00:38:47.240 --> 00:38:49.440]   you know, condemnation of jewel
[00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:52.560]   because it starts people smoking in high school.
[00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:53.920]   - That's the issue.
[00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:55.840]   - That she said, oh, well, I don't trust jewel,
[00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:57.000]   it's not as safe as cigarettes.
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:58.840]   Is it safer than cigarettes?
[00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:02.160]   Everybody says, the CDC, everybody says,
[00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:05.520]   don't start smoking, but if you already smoke cigarettes,
[00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:07.440]   it would be better to vape.
[00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:08.280]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:10.920]   - And I had a really convince her of that.
[00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:12.680]   It was very hard.
[00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:15.640]   So I wanna be clear that jewel isn't a bad thing
[00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:17.720]   if you're a cigarette smoker trying to cut down.
[00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:18.560]   - Right, right.
[00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:19.600]   And I've been there.
[00:39:20.680 --> 00:39:24.520]   But anyway, I find it fascinating
[00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:27.440]   that we thought that the internet was gonna be
[00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:30.960]   about direct response, you know, buy it now.
[00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:34.160]   And you had all these publishers trying to convince
[00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:36.080]   advertisers, no, it's really about branding
[00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:37.520]   and how they work.
[00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:39.560]   - Everybody wants brand advertising.
[00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:43.160]   - But it was because it's higher spoke, it value.
[00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:45.720]   But what happened is that all of these companies now
[00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:47.840]   on TV are direct response.
[00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:50.440]   They start off with you and then away luggage
[00:39:50.440 --> 00:39:53.360]   is advertising every 30 seconds on TV,
[00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:55.680]   which was a guest of mine on our podcast.
[00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:58.160]   - That does drag me crazy because away was it.
[00:39:58.160 --> 00:39:59.400]   We helped away become-
[00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:01.320]   - Big enough. - And unfortunately,
[00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:05.000]   there's this mentality that you start on podcasts,
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:07.480]   but once you're big enough, you get off a podcast,
[00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:09.640]   which by the way, work better than any television ad,
[00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:11.200]   and you spend all your money on TV.
[00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:12.640]   - It's like wildly expensive on TV.
[00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:13.680]   - Wildly expensive.
[00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:15.680]   - You know, it happened with Squarespace,
[00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:17.360]   who we took from zero to 60.
[00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:19.400]   I mean, when they started advertising with us,
[00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:22.200]   they were on every, but they probably still are
[00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:23.720]   on every podcast in the world,
[00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:25.200]   but we were the first.
[00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:29.200]   And we really, I mean, we really did well for them.
[00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:31.200]   And as soon as they made enough money,
[00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:33.040]   they started buying Super Bowl ads.
[00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:37.360]   And it's like, dudes, dude, one Super Bowl ad,
[00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:41.080]   five years a twit, which is gonna produce more results.
[00:40:41.080 --> 00:40:42.080]   - Right.
[00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:43.920]   - But you can't convince them because there's-
[00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:45.120]   - Well, it's a different audience.
[00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:46.880]   (buzzer)
[00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:48.200]   - Sorry, it's true. - It's true.
[00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:50.360]   - It's true, but it's made, but honestly,
[00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:51.200]   what do you-
[00:40:51.200 --> 00:40:52.400]   - People will make websites?
[00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:53.280]   - What are you in business to do?
[00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:56.600]   Sign up, people, or get a better audience.
[00:40:56.600 --> 00:40:57.440]   It's really bad.
[00:40:57.440 --> 00:40:59.680]   - This notion of scale, this notion that you have to be big,
[00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:01.400]   I was with a whole bunch of publishers today
[00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:03.840]   and folks around digital.
[00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:05.880]   And this idea that you have to get everything to mass
[00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:07.160]   and everything to scale.
[00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:12.160]   No, you can do 20, you know, 10 times 100,000.
[00:41:12.160 --> 00:41:14.120]   Is that a million?
[00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:15.000]   Yes.
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:15.840]   - Okay.
[00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:18.520]   - So, you know, you can do 10 things at 100,000,
[00:41:18.520 --> 00:41:20.120]   or you can do one at a million.
[00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:21.760]   The result is the same.
[00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:24.200]   You could, if you know what you're doing,
[00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:26.600]   you can be more focused at the 10, 100,000s,
[00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:28.480]   you can be more efficient.
[00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:30.360]   You can do a lot of things.
[00:41:30.360 --> 00:41:31.640]   You can know your data better,
[00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:34.840]   but there's this prejudice to get to mass.
[00:41:34.840 --> 00:41:35.680]   - Honestly-
[00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:39.600]   - I don't know why everybody just doesn't buy Facebook
[00:41:39.600 --> 00:41:40.640]   and Google and go home.
[00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:41.920]   Don't tell Lisa I said that.
[00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:42.920]   - Yeah, I know, I know.
[00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:45.720]   But those have to be the most efficient ad buys
[00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:46.560]   in the world.
[00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:47.600]   - Well, when we looked at those political ads
[00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:49.080]   on the Stacey when you were gone last week,
[00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:52.160]   we looked at the Facebook tool
[00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:56.040]   for the political ad archive.
[00:41:56.040 --> 00:41:58.720]   And it's every buy is $100 to $1,000.
[00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:01.200]   And they're buying 20 ABs,
[00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:04.440]   but they're tiny buys with huge efficiency.
[00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:07.000]   - Yeah, no, we actually use Facebook advertising
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   to promote the IOT podcast occasionally.
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:11.320]   - So do we.
[00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:12.320]   - It's super, yeah.
[00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:14.120]   - Yeah, we do Twitter ads too.
[00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:17.600]   - Well, it's like, thanks for promoting my show, Leo.
[00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:20.280]   - Just for you, we only buy IOT Stacey on IOT.
[00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:21.600]   - Excellent.
[00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:26.160]   - But there is another reason I would just,
[00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:27.600]   before we end this conversation,
[00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:29.280]   so I can go home tonight.
[00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:30.680]   And obviously, on the couch,
[00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:33.520]   the reason you buy Twit, for instance,
[00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:35.360]   is because it's somebody you trust
[00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:38.120]   talking about a product that's a very different
[00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:40.600]   kind of ad than a Facebook or Google ad.
[00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:43.400]   And I would submit it's very important.
[00:42:43.400 --> 00:42:45.920]   It's like word of mouse, and that is much more effective.
[00:42:45.920 --> 00:42:47.760]   It may not be more efficient in the sense
[00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:50.000]   that you reach the target audience more efficiently,
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:51.240]   but I think they're much more effective.
[00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:52.720]   Now I do-- - Well, the truth is,
[00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:55.520]   you give both direct response and branding at once
[00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:56.360]   because of that trust act.
[00:42:56.360 --> 00:42:57.200]   - Absolutely.
[00:42:57.200 --> 00:42:58.880]   - I do-- - I do point out--
[00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:00.000]   - Leo, rub off.
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:04.440]   - Some of our advertisers though have not turned out so well.
[00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:06.520]   And I'm gonna mention two.
[00:43:06.520 --> 00:43:10.360]   I'm sad to say Bosch's curry robot never happened.
[00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:11.120]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:13.680]   - But they were funded every penny.
[00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:16.440]   So I don't feel too bad about that.
[00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:18.640]   - That's too bad, yeah. - And then we talked on Sunday,
[00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:21.200]   but we can mention it here again on about ring.
[00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:25.760]   And I still have my ring doorbell.
[00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:28.360]   I love ring, and I was very happy to advertise them.
[00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:30.280]   I thought Jamie Simmonoff was a great guy.
[00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:32.200]   He's the founder of ring.
[00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:36.960]   But they've recently come under some severe scrutiny.
[00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:39.720]   The original story came from the information.
[00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:42.400]   So I'm gonna give, I don't wanna give Sam Biddle the time of day,
[00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:44.120]   but I'll give the information credit
[00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:47.560]   for they're the ones who really discovered it.
[00:43:47.560 --> 00:43:50.120]   Sam as usual just rewriting their stuff.
[00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:53.520]   But I think, what do you think of that?
[00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:54.760]   We talked Stacy already about it,
[00:43:54.760 --> 00:43:58.080]   but I'm gonna give Jeff a chance to talk about what,
[00:43:58.080 --> 00:43:59.600]   so the point was that ring,
[00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:03.960]   Jamie in 2016 opened a Ukraine office.
[00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:05.720]   And when they went out there to visit,
[00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:08.080]   according to the information's story,
[00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:12.160]   the Ukrainians, one of the initiatives was
[00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:13.920]   we need to improve our recognition,
[00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:16.680]   our face recognition, our object recognition.
[00:44:16.680 --> 00:44:18.160]   The Ukrainians said, okay,
[00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:20.480]   but you gotta give us access to the data
[00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:24.480]   so that we can build in some of this machine learning.
[00:44:24.480 --> 00:44:31.240]   And unfortunately, they did.
[00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:36.400]   Jamie left, and by the way, ring has denied
[00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:37.840]   that Jamie was the one who said it,
[00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:40.680]   but the story said that.
[00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:44.000]   And then as he walked out the door,
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:46.360]   they were given access to that Amazon S3 bucket
[00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:48.960]   with all the videos.
[00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:51.520]   On the spot, Mr. Siminoff agreed to arrange the team
[00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:54.760]   to get administrative access to Raven's web-based interface
[00:44:54.760 --> 00:44:56.920]   where customer videos could be streamed,
[00:44:56.920 --> 00:44:58.480]   according to multiple people either present
[00:44:58.480 --> 00:44:59.680]   or briefed about the meeting.
[00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:03.520]   That resulted in a real issue because those videos
[00:45:03.520 --> 00:45:06.200]   were now available to be shared,
[00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:09.560]   to be viewed without customer permission
[00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:12.840]   by these Ukrainian employees.
[00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:15.200]   And of course, now some of this story,
[00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:16.720]   and somebody in the comments said,
[00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:18.560]   "If this had been a British company,
[00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:20.000]   "would you have had the same problems?
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:22.280]   "Because of its Ukraine,
[00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:24.880]   "there's some concern about the security.
[00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:26.840]   "The security of vulnerability is one of several problems
[00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:28.640]   "with Ring's Ukraine office.
[00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:31.200]   "The engineers hired for the team often had little experience,
[00:45:31.200 --> 00:45:34.320]   "hindering the development of AI-powered doorbells.
[00:45:34.320 --> 00:45:37.160]   "They got the database of all the video history.
[00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:40.200]   "Now a year later, Ring was acquired by Amazon.
[00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:42.120]   "And as best we can tell,
[00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:44.120]   "maybe Stacy, you're covering the story too.
[00:45:44.120 --> 00:45:46.880]   "Amazon has stopped this practice, I'm not sure."
[00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:49.440]   - Yes, and I would also caution,
[00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:51.840]   so I know, Jeff, you're about to talk, I'm sorry.
[00:45:51.840 --> 00:45:52.880]   - No, I asked you Stacy,
[00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:53.720]   - What information?
[00:45:53.720 --> 00:45:54.560]   - Yes, no.
[00:45:54.560 --> 00:45:58.160]   - So Amazon has changed that.
[00:45:58.160 --> 00:46:00.400]   I think this might be an issue of,
[00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:02.000]   "Hey, you ask and you get.
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:05.000]   "It's like a startup, we don't have process in place
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:06.040]   "for this, right?"
[00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:08.800]   So I don't think it was necessarily nefarious.
[00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:10.200]   I do think it's probably careless.
[00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:12.040]   - I do, I have respect for Jamie.
[00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:13.760]   I think Jamie is really smart.
[00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:15.480]   He's a great founder,
[00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:19.440]   and I don't think that he did this in any way maliciously,
[00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:22.080]   or with any goal of breaking security.
[00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:24.280]   They just weren't thinking, they had no process.
[00:46:24.280 --> 00:46:26.400]   A spokesperson for Ring told the information,
[00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:30.120]   "Customer videos are encrypted today,
[00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:32.960]   "but didn't respond to questions about when Ring began
[00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:34.880]   "encrypting the video."
[00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:37.040]   So these were unencrypted videos,
[00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:39.280]   shareable videos out of an S3 bucket.
[00:46:39.280 --> 00:46:41.440]   Now, for me, it's not a big deal.
[00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:42.280]   It was a doorbell.
[00:46:42.280 --> 00:46:44.840]   I don't care if anybody looks at my front door,
[00:46:44.840 --> 00:46:47.280]   but there are written door cameras Ring makes it,
[00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:49.240]   those stick up cams that you could put inside.
[00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:50.080]   So.
[00:46:50.080 --> 00:46:53.040]   - Yeah, I think you've already said it.
[00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:54.480]   I think it was careless.
[00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:56.760]   I think that especially when you're a small company,
[00:46:56.760 --> 00:46:59.880]   maybe you can't afford to have that executive
[00:46:59.880 --> 00:47:02.440]   who's in charge of leasing these things,
[00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:04.640]   but you need that person.
[00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:05.680]   - That's a good higher level.
[00:47:05.680 --> 00:47:07.880]   - But it's true with a higher level too.
[00:47:07.880 --> 00:47:11.040]   I mean, when I wrote my post about Facebook two weeks ago,
[00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:13.560]   I've long said they needed a journalist,
[00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:14.840]   and then I made fun of journalists,
[00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:15.720]   so maybe it's not a journalist,
[00:47:15.720 --> 00:47:20.160]   but they need someone at a high level in that company
[00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:22.000]   who has the authority to make change,
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:25.200]   who can make them and keep them honest.
[00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:27.080]   And these companies all need that.
[00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:29.840]   I don't think that their motive is bad at the get go,
[00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:34.840]   but carelessness leads people into presumptions of panic.
[00:47:34.840 --> 00:47:39.080]   - I would say I think tech has gotten a pass on this
[00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:42.280]   because they've been too nerdy for so long, right?
[00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:45.080]   If you think about like your typical tech thing,
[00:47:45.080 --> 00:47:46.880]   the idea of moving fast and breaking things
[00:47:46.880 --> 00:47:49.760]   is one aspect of it, but another aspect is just like,
[00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:53.320]   tech historically was tech, right?
[00:47:53.320 --> 00:47:54.880]   It wasn't for everyone else,
[00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:57.920]   but that has not been true for like the last two decades.
[00:47:57.920 --> 00:48:00.120]   - But we still have that mindset though, you're right.
[00:48:00.120 --> 00:48:03.280]   - But we still have this mindset of it's okay.
[00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:07.160]   And I think like if I'm starting a company
[00:48:07.160 --> 00:48:08.600]   outside of the tech world,
[00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:10.800]   like let's say I'm starting just an escrow company
[00:48:10.800 --> 00:48:13.240]   or a medical billing company,
[00:48:13.240 --> 00:48:16.200]   these are actually things that people start all the time.
[00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:18.400]   There are a long list of regulations
[00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:21.520]   and things that you would never think to ignore.
[00:48:21.520 --> 00:48:25.240]   You would actually design your company around,
[00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:29.640]   you know, protection of data, meeting these regulations.
[00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:32.200]   And tech has been given a pass
[00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:34.400]   and I think it's probably time to stop
[00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:36.680]   because the type of data they're getting a hold of
[00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:41.680]   and using is, I don't know if their quote unquote innovations
[00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:45.320]   really make up for the fact that they have access
[00:48:45.320 --> 00:48:46.160]   to so much information.
[00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:47.800]   - Oh, I think the pass is over.
[00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:50.160]   I think the pass is well over, don't you?
[00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:52.880]   - This year or 2018 for sure.
[00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:53.720]   (laughing)
[00:48:53.720 --> 00:48:54.960]   - 2019? - Yeah, everything changed.
[00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:57.920]   Well, it started 2018, 2019 maybe.
[00:48:57.920 --> 00:49:00.560]   And you know, books like that surveillance capitalism book,
[00:49:00.560 --> 00:49:04.000]   I think, and you know, what was the,
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:07.360]   what was the book before that saw we interviewed him?
[00:49:07.360 --> 00:49:11.280]   But the gang of four, this stuff is gonna change,
[00:49:11.280 --> 00:49:12.880]   is changing, this really stuff is,
[00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:14.680]   people are starting to really look hard on this.
[00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:16.080]   I think they should, they need--
[00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:17.960]   - And they should, I mean, I know Jeff
[00:49:17.960 --> 00:49:19.360]   that you will talk about Technopanic.
[00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:21.920]   I don't think it's panicked to say,
[00:49:21.920 --> 00:49:25.240]   there's a lot of information about individuals
[00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:30.240]   that is now collectively available for massive data mining
[00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:32.360]   in a way that we've never had before.
[00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:35.560]   And then also say that the implications of that data
[00:49:35.560 --> 00:49:38.000]   getting into the wrong hands are being used in ways
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:40.120]   that we haven't even discovered yet,
[00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:43.040]   are going to cause a lot of harm to people.
[00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:45.400]   There's the possibility of them causing good,
[00:49:45.400 --> 00:49:47.880]   but it's unclear yet if we're the good,
[00:49:47.880 --> 00:49:50.600]   we will outweigh the harms that we're not even talking about it.
[00:49:50.600 --> 00:49:51.680]   - Sue Buff is great on that.
[00:49:51.680 --> 00:49:52.680]   She says-- - One thing we're talking
[00:49:52.680 --> 00:49:54.760]   about, and she said we're talking about it every day.
[00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:56.760]   - Well, we do on this show, for sure.
[00:49:56.760 --> 00:49:59.080]   - Yeah, I think that's what the show is well about.
[00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:01.440]   - It's well in the agenda of the public conversation.
[00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:02.600]   - So there's nothing wrong with that.
[00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:03.440]   That's what we're talking about.
[00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:05.120]   - No, there's not, but I'm saying, yeah.
[00:50:05.120 --> 00:50:07.440]   So I think-- - And Sue Buff is very clear to say,
[00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:11.640]   I'm not, she's not cast against technology at all.
[00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:13.000]   - Yeah, I love technology.
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:14.240]   - I think it can do amazing things.
[00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:16.560]   - Don't conflate that, but what she says,
[00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:19.200]   and this is the thing, and I'm still thinking about whether this,
[00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:21.560]   she said, you know, at first the trade-off was,
[00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:23.480]   you give them information, you get targeted ads.
[00:50:23.480 --> 00:50:25.640]   We all knew that, we can kind of live with that.
[00:50:25.640 --> 00:50:27.440]   But then it was starting to predict behavior,
[00:50:27.440 --> 00:50:30.880]   and she said, my heart concern is a future
[00:50:30.880 --> 00:50:33.840]   where it is used to influence behavior.
[00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:38.400]   And that, you know, what we're moving into
[00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:42.480]   is this kind of basically surrendering sovereignty
[00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:45.120]   to this entity, the big other.
[00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:48.320]   She could, not big brother, big other, she calls it.
[00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:51.360]   And I think that that's not unfair.
[00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:54.000]   I think that that's very much a possibility,
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:55.400]   and certainly something we don't want,
[00:50:55.400 --> 00:50:56.760]   and something we should pay attention to.
[00:50:56.760 --> 00:50:58.560]   It doesn't mean it's going to happen,
[00:50:58.560 --> 00:50:59.960]   but it's something we need to pay attention to.
[00:50:59.960 --> 00:51:02.360]   Here's an example, and I bet you,
[00:51:02.360 --> 00:51:04.280]   you have different takes on this.
[00:51:04.280 --> 00:51:07.400]   - Oh, I was gonna use this as my number,
[00:51:07.400 --> 00:51:09.560]   I was gonna use this one, I was gonna put it up here.
[00:51:09.560 --> 00:51:11.600]   Oh yeah, I got something to say about this one.
[00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:13.040]   - Oh yeah. - That woman speaking
[00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:15.360]   is exactly how I think about everything.
[00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:18.240]   - You're gonna read surveillance capitalism, Stacy.
[00:51:18.240 --> 00:51:21.000]   It's a great, but 625 pages, but read it,
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:24.440]   and then we'll debate it, and you haven't read it yet either.
[00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:25.520]   - Can we talk about that story?
[00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:26.360]   Can we talk about that story?
[00:51:26.360 --> 00:51:27.360]   - Let's do the 10 year meet.
[00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:30.240]   So this is the Facebook 10 year challenge
[00:51:30.240 --> 00:51:33.040]   where cleat and utter bull.
[00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:35.000]   It is moral panic, great example.
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:36.160]   - Oh yeah, great example.
[00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:37.360]   - If you use social-- - Wait, moral panic
[00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:38.200]   or technical panic.
[00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:40.560]   - I'm gonna give you some pack, some moral panic.
[00:51:40.560 --> 00:51:41.400]   I'm gonna give you some facts.
[00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:42.960]   Let me give you the story first.
[00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:44.960]   Kato Neil writing in Wired.
[00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:47.560]   If you use social media, you've probably noticed a trend
[00:51:47.560 --> 00:51:50.360]   across Facebook, Instagram and Twitter,
[00:51:50.360 --> 00:51:53.280]   of people posting their then and now profile pictures,
[00:51:53.280 --> 00:51:55.760]   mostly from 10 years ago and this year.
[00:51:55.760 --> 00:51:59.760]   She said, I put out a flippant tweet,
[00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:01.760]   me 10 years ago probably would have played along
[00:52:01.760 --> 00:52:04.880]   with a profile picture aging meme going around.
[00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:07.560]   Me now ponders how all this data can be mined
[00:52:07.560 --> 00:52:09.960]   to train facial recognition algorithms
[00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:12.560]   on age progression and age recognition.
[00:52:12.560 --> 00:52:14.640]   I agree with her.
[00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:16.400]   That's exactly what this is all about.
[00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:18.120]   You disagree, Jeff?
[00:52:18.120 --> 00:52:20.280]   - So yes, let me go on through this today.
[00:52:20.280 --> 00:52:23.880]   So number one, this is absurd
[00:52:23.880 --> 00:52:25.640]   because two years ago Google showed
[00:52:25.640 --> 00:52:28.320]   that they can compare the same person
[00:52:28.320 --> 00:52:30.800]   in photos from infancy to current.
[00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:33.400]   There's been done.
[00:52:33.400 --> 00:52:37.560]   Number two, this would be a really crappy data set.
[00:52:37.560 --> 00:52:40.360]   Facebook also has data of people who are identified
[00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:41.560]   from ages to ages.
[00:52:41.560 --> 00:52:43.120]   This is pure paranoia.
[00:52:43.120 --> 00:52:45.400]   So I went in and I had the conversation with her
[00:52:45.400 --> 00:52:48.840]   and her editor, Nick Thompson, on Twitter.
[00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:53.080]   And I said those things and I said,
[00:52:53.080 --> 00:52:55.960]   this is kind of ridiculous.
[00:52:55.960 --> 00:52:57.720]   Nick came back and said,
[00:52:57.720 --> 00:52:59.240]   also then the response was,
[00:52:59.240 --> 00:53:02.340]   well, Facebook is doing the new news for money.
[00:53:02.340 --> 00:53:04.400]   Well, - Facebook by the way,
[00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:06.320]   says we didn't come up with this.
[00:53:06.320 --> 00:53:07.960]   They didn't do this, right?
[00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:10.560]   And so it's, yeah, it's this moral panic
[00:53:10.560 --> 00:53:12.880]   because an example of the kind of paranoia
[00:53:12.880 --> 00:53:15.480]   that is now bred, a simple little thing comes up.
[00:53:15.480 --> 00:53:17.200]   People have pictures from 10 years, this is cute.
[00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:18.120]   This is fine, right?
[00:53:18.120 --> 00:53:20.280]   Few years ago, we all would have joined in and said fine.
[00:53:20.280 --> 00:53:22.120]   So now there is this presumption
[00:53:22.120 --> 00:53:25.720]   of some horrible motive and some horrible conspiracy.
[00:53:25.720 --> 00:53:27.240]   It's a conspiracy theorizing.
[00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:30.360]   It is moral panic that's trying to blame everything
[00:53:30.360 --> 00:53:33.240]   and find anxious motive for everything
[00:53:33.240 --> 00:53:34.880]   that anyone sees on technology.
[00:53:34.880 --> 00:53:36.760]   And this is the danger, my friends.
[00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:38.920]   The danger is this kind of crap,
[00:53:38.920 --> 00:53:42.120]   this kind of fake news will lead
[00:53:42.120 --> 00:53:45.040]   to regulation of the internet for us all.
[00:53:45.040 --> 00:53:47.240]   - Holy cow, you could not be more wrong.
[00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:48.600]   - I had a fit.
[00:53:48.600 --> 00:53:50.440]   I had a fit to be.
[00:53:50.440 --> 00:53:52.640]   Well, Stacy, the story is just wrong.
[00:53:52.640 --> 00:53:54.440]   The story is just wrong on every count.
[00:53:54.440 --> 00:53:55.280]   - This is wrong.
[00:53:55.280 --> 00:53:56.120]   - Wrong.
[00:53:56.120 --> 00:53:59.800]   - Her thinking, her thinking on this topic
[00:53:59.800 --> 00:54:03.680]   is what I am identifying with, not the entire story.
[00:54:03.680 --> 00:54:07.560]   But I would say this is actually a positive.
[00:54:07.560 --> 00:54:09.920]   This is where we want to get people
[00:54:09.920 --> 00:54:14.800]   when they are about to use technology to ask themselves,
[00:54:14.800 --> 00:54:18.200]   is it worth the exchange of data that I'm about?
[00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:20.400]   What is gonna come of this?
[00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:22.800]   I think that is actually so smart.
[00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:23.640]   - It's so smart.
[00:54:23.640 --> 00:54:24.480]   It's like- - Tell me the harm.
[00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:25.800]   - It's like, it's like- - Tell me the harm.
[00:54:25.800 --> 00:54:28.840]   - Hold on, it is like teaching people about interest rates,
[00:54:28.840 --> 00:54:32.640]   which have a purpose, but also can cause people harm.
[00:54:32.640 --> 00:54:35.960]   I'm not saying usually, I'm just saying interest rates
[00:54:35.960 --> 00:54:38.000]   associated with credit cards, right?
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:39.880]   Now, the other part of this is,
[00:54:39.880 --> 00:54:43.240]   she's not saying it's evil or there's harm.
[00:54:43.240 --> 00:54:46.400]   She's just wondering if it's going to be,
[00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:48.640]   you know, used for image progression.
[00:54:48.640 --> 00:54:51.160]   And Google has shown that they can do this.
[00:54:51.160 --> 00:54:53.000]   Facebook might need that data.
[00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:55.680]   Another company that puts these out might need that data.
[00:54:55.680 --> 00:55:00.080]   And this sort of data has been collected in the past
[00:55:00.080 --> 00:55:05.080]   through fun, cutesy apps and used for exactly that purpose.
[00:55:05.080 --> 00:55:09.360]   So it has a basis, in fact, to wonder about it.
[00:55:09.360 --> 00:55:11.840]   So- - So her boss, well, I like a lot,
[00:55:11.840 --> 00:55:12.840]   Nick Thompson.
[00:55:12.840 --> 00:55:16.280]   I'm trying to find the tweet right now.
[00:55:16.280 --> 00:55:18.640]   This is what got me going.
[00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:19.480]   - Okay, what?
[00:55:19.480 --> 00:55:21.480]   - Yeah, cause you are really upset.
[00:55:21.480 --> 00:55:25.440]   - I'm very upset about this because it is dangerous.
[00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:27.200]   And I wanna read his tweet.
[00:55:27.200 --> 00:55:28.960]   And again, I have immense respect for Nick.
[00:55:28.960 --> 00:55:30.160]   He's an excellent editor.
[00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:33.480]   He under him, wired, it's been just great.
[00:55:33.480 --> 00:55:34.640]   And he came back and we had it.
[00:55:34.640 --> 00:55:36.200]   There was an exchange and he came back and said,
[00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:37.560]   what I said was fair.
[00:55:37.560 --> 00:55:38.640]   Now I'm trying to find it
[00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:39.480]   cause I'm between much today.
[00:55:39.480 --> 00:55:43.960]   - I feel like, of course, this is relatively benign.
[00:55:43.960 --> 00:55:46.400]   But I don't think it's a bad thing to alert people
[00:55:46.400 --> 00:55:48.440]   to the fact that this kind of data
[00:55:48.440 --> 00:55:50.360]   is something these companies want.
[00:55:50.360 --> 00:55:53.080]   And you should be aware that you might be giving them
[00:55:53.080 --> 00:55:54.240]   this kind of information.
[00:55:54.240 --> 00:55:55.720]   - Yeah, my people are not aware.
[00:55:55.720 --> 00:55:57.880]   I just wanna give you one more data point,
[00:55:57.880 --> 00:55:59.640]   which is a study that just came out
[00:55:59.640 --> 00:56:01.560]   from the Pew Research Center.
[00:56:01.560 --> 00:56:06.600]   Three quarters of Facebook users, 74% in their survey
[00:56:06.600 --> 00:56:10.160]   did not know the social networking behemoth,
[00:56:10.160 --> 00:56:11.600]   according to TechCrunch,
[00:56:11.600 --> 00:56:13.680]   maintains a list of their interest and traits
[00:56:13.680 --> 00:56:15.640]   to target with the math, with ads.
[00:56:15.640 --> 00:56:18.080]   74% of the Facebook users--
[00:56:18.080 --> 00:56:20.200]   - Do they know that the New York Times does that?
[00:56:20.200 --> 00:56:21.200]   Why does that?
[00:56:21.200 --> 00:56:22.040]   And time may be.
[00:56:22.040 --> 00:56:23.680]   - Well, if they don't think Facebook does it,
[00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:25.320]   they certainly don't think anybody else does it.
[00:56:25.320 --> 00:56:26.160]   - Yeah.
[00:56:26.160 --> 00:56:27.000]   - So they don't know where they can be.
[00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:29.200]   They discovered this when researchers directed them
[00:56:29.200 --> 00:56:32.320]   to view their Facebook ad preferences page.
[00:56:32.320 --> 00:56:35.360]   A majority, 51% said they were uncomfortable
[00:56:35.360 --> 00:56:37.720]   with Facebook compiling the information.
[00:56:37.720 --> 00:56:41.400]   27% said the ad preference listing Facebook had generated
[00:56:41.400 --> 00:56:43.000]   was inaccurate.
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:46.040]   88% of polled users had some material generated
[00:56:46.040 --> 00:56:48.080]   for them on the ad preferences page.
[00:56:48.080 --> 00:56:51.040]   So the big number, the takeaway is three quarters
[00:56:51.040 --> 00:56:52.600]   of the Facebook user survey,
[00:56:52.600 --> 00:56:53.640]   and I think it's probably accurate,
[00:56:53.640 --> 00:56:55.200]   Pew's very good on these.
[00:56:55.200 --> 00:56:58.120]   Three quarters didn't even know that Facebook targets them
[00:56:58.120 --> 00:57:01.360]   with ads based on what they give Facebook.
[00:57:01.360 --> 00:57:02.720]   - Can we go back to the--
[00:57:02.720 --> 00:57:03.920]   - I found the tweet.
[00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:05.520]   - So this-- - So Nick Thompson again.
[00:57:05.520 --> 00:57:06.360]   - Hold on a second.
[00:57:06.360 --> 00:57:09.440]   In regard to this, it's of, I think, a value to say,
[00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:11.320]   "Hey, you know this 10 year progression thing.
[00:57:11.320 --> 00:57:13.680]   Here's the kind of thing companies might want to do with that."
[00:57:13.680 --> 00:57:14.520]   - Look at that.
[00:57:14.520 --> 00:57:15.360]   - Mm.
[00:57:15.360 --> 00:57:17.080]   So Nick Thompson, again, wire editor,
[00:57:17.080 --> 00:57:18.680]   respectable immensely, I think he's great.
[00:57:18.680 --> 00:57:20.160]   His tweet said this.
[00:57:20.160 --> 00:57:22.280]   "Let's say you wanted to train official recognition
[00:57:22.280 --> 00:57:23.240]   algorithm on aging.
[00:57:23.240 --> 00:57:24.240]   What would you do?
[00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:28.320]   Maybe start a meme like 10 year challenge, period."
[00:57:28.320 --> 00:57:30.120]   That is fake news.
[00:57:30.120 --> 00:57:31.680]   That is misleading.
[00:57:31.680 --> 00:57:32.520]   That is lying.
[00:57:32.520 --> 00:57:34.840]   So I come back and I say, utterly unnecessary.
[00:57:34.840 --> 00:57:36.400]   Google photos two years ago demonstrated
[00:57:36.400 --> 00:57:38.640]   that it already tracks people back to infancy
[00:57:38.640 --> 00:57:39.880]   by their images.
[00:57:39.880 --> 00:57:41.280]   Facebook has a better repository
[00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:42.640]   of people tagged over time.
[00:57:42.640 --> 00:57:45.000]   There need not be an nefarious motive
[00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:47.160]   to everything social you see.
[00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:48.080]   Somebody else came in and said,
[00:57:48.080 --> 00:57:49.280]   "Well, that's not really the article says."
[00:57:49.280 --> 00:57:50.120]   And I came back and I said,
[00:57:50.120 --> 00:57:51.120]   "Yeah, but his tweet said this
[00:57:51.120 --> 00:57:53.040]   and I wanted a contrary tweet."
[00:57:53.040 --> 00:57:54.920]   Nick came back and said, "Fair."
[00:57:54.920 --> 00:57:57.600]   And Facebook has now responded that they didn't start.
[00:57:57.600 --> 00:58:00.000]   Also, they could add, as the article states,
[00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:01.160]   that it's not entirely clear
[00:58:01.160 --> 00:58:02.480]   that having better face recognition
[00:58:02.480 --> 00:58:05.440]   aging AI does any one harm.
[00:58:05.440 --> 00:58:07.840]   - Okay, can the story get there?
[00:58:07.840 --> 00:58:09.040]   - No, you didn't.
[00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:11.960]   Because if you read to the second paragraph
[00:58:11.960 --> 00:58:13.200]   of the story, she says,
[00:58:13.200 --> 00:58:14.920]   "My intent wasn't to claim
[00:58:14.920 --> 00:58:17.680]   that the meme is inherently dangerous."
[00:58:17.680 --> 00:58:20.600]   - But what happens when her own editor
[00:58:20.600 --> 00:58:21.800]   tweeted this Stacy?
[00:58:21.800 --> 00:58:25.400]   - And we know people don't read up.
[00:58:25.400 --> 00:58:27.360]   - However, it's, however, it is.
[00:58:27.360 --> 00:58:29.320]   - It's just as if flying's moral panic
[00:58:29.320 --> 00:58:30.680]   because this is trying to panic people
[00:58:30.680 --> 00:58:31.520]   about something that actually--
[00:58:31.520 --> 00:58:32.360]   - No, you're panic-ed.
[00:58:32.360 --> 00:58:33.680]   - Jeff, you're wrong.
[00:58:33.680 --> 00:58:34.520]   - You're wrong.
[00:58:34.520 --> 00:58:37.120]   Because we've seen Microsoft do this with that aging thing.
[00:58:37.120 --> 00:58:39.560]   This is the kind of data companies do want.
[00:58:39.560 --> 00:58:41.320]   They have actively pursued,
[00:58:41.320 --> 00:58:42.960]   Google did it, as you said.
[00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:44.760]   And just because it happened once
[00:58:44.760 --> 00:58:46.960]   doesn't mean other companies aren't attempting it.
[00:58:46.960 --> 00:58:49.520]   And there isn't the need for a larger data set.
[00:58:49.520 --> 00:58:51.760]   We know Google does this all the time.
[00:58:51.760 --> 00:58:54.480]   They created the Google happiest data set you could imagine.
[00:58:54.480 --> 00:58:55.320]   - No, no, no, no.
[00:58:55.320 --> 00:58:57.640]   - No tech can have their brain would use this.
[00:58:57.640 --> 00:58:59.480]   - Okay, the point isn't, okay,
[00:58:59.480 --> 00:59:03.640]   the point isn't that the point of this article
[00:59:03.640 --> 00:59:07.160]   isn't that it's happening this way.
[00:59:07.160 --> 00:59:10.280]   The point, no, no, no, the point of the article
[00:59:10.280 --> 00:59:13.480]   is that people should ask these questions.
[00:59:13.480 --> 00:59:15.920]   - Yeah, Jeff, you're missing the forest for the trees.
[00:59:15.920 --> 00:59:19.800]   You're focusing on the precise data that she's talking about.
[00:59:19.800 --> 00:59:21.360]   But really the largest point is-
[00:59:21.360 --> 00:59:22.360]   - 'Cause it's trying to get people panicky
[00:59:22.360 --> 00:59:24.280]   and concerned about something that is now working.
[00:59:24.280 --> 00:59:26.600]   - No, it's trying to get people aware
[00:59:26.600 --> 00:59:28.400]   that giving their data away-
[00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:29.240]   - Well, but-
[00:59:29.240 --> 00:59:30.080]   - An actual- - An actual-
[00:59:30.080 --> 00:59:31.400]   - That a few years ago,
[00:59:31.400 --> 00:59:32.240]   everybody was-
[00:59:32.240 --> 00:59:33.320]   - It isn't a fun little game.
[00:59:33.320 --> 00:59:34.160]   That's like saying-
[00:59:34.160 --> 00:59:35.000]   - Yes, it is.
[00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:35.840]   - All those-
[00:59:35.840 --> 00:59:36.680]   - No, it is.
[00:59:36.680 --> 00:59:37.520]   - That's the point.
[00:59:37.520 --> 00:59:39.440]   - It is gathering so companies use-
[00:59:39.440 --> 00:59:40.840]   - That's what the report he says.
[00:59:40.840 --> 00:59:41.920]   - It's a fun little game.
[00:59:41.920 --> 00:59:44.440]   - It's like a few years ago,
[00:59:44.440 --> 00:59:48.320]   which Game of Thrones character quiz on Facebook?
[00:59:48.320 --> 00:59:50.320]   - Well, that's just a fun little game.
[00:59:50.320 --> 00:59:51.720]   What could possibly go wrong?
[00:59:51.720 --> 00:59:53.960]   Which Game of Thrones character are you?
[00:59:53.960 --> 00:59:56.080]   - Sure. - Which Simpsons character you-
[00:59:56.080 --> 00:59:57.520]   There's no harm to doing that.
[00:59:57.520 --> 00:59:59.680]   We know now there is.
[00:59:59.680 --> 01:00:01.120]   Jeff? - Yes, that was the basis
[01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:02.400]   of the Cambridge Analytica.
[01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:03.240]   - Wait, no, there's-
[01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:05.760]   - This does a speculative paranoid,
[01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:07.880]   what if there didn't exist?
[01:00:07.880 --> 01:00:09.040]   - This is wrong.
[01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:09.880]   - Well, we don't know.
[01:00:09.880 --> 01:00:11.240]   First of all, you don't know that.
[01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:12.440]   You don't know that.
[01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:14.360]   I think you don't know what the company-
[01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:15.960]   - Facebook is not gonna lie in the top of the island.
[01:00:15.960 --> 01:00:16.800]   - Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:18.320]   - Facebook's not gonna lie.
[01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:21.080]   - The Nick Thompson, the other Facebook's not gonna lie?
[01:00:21.080 --> 01:00:22.720]   - I think Nick Thompson, the editor of-
[01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:25.040]   - Have you not been paying attention?
[01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:28.560]   Facebook lies all the time.
[01:00:28.560 --> 01:00:31.640]   - Jeff, it feels like your concern
[01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:36.640]   is making you see this as something way,
[01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:39.160]   you're just too sensitive to this.
[01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:40.560]   This is like when someone-
[01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:42.000]   - Is he gonna be protecting free speech on the internet?
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:42.840]   Yeah, I am.
[01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:45.000]   Well, I think that's overblown too.
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:45.840]   I don't think that-
[01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:46.840]   - This is, that's my point.
[01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:47.840]   This is overblown.
[01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:49.120]   This is panicking everybody.
[01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:50.560]   I'll stand here on this technology show
[01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:52.520]   to defend the internet against this kind
[01:00:52.520 --> 01:00:54.000]   of moral panic and idiocy.
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:56.240]   - All right.
[01:00:56.240 --> 01:00:57.080]   - Oh, man.
[01:00:57.080 --> 01:00:58.240]   - Okay.
[01:00:58.240 --> 01:00:59.720]   - Well, I say, oh man, backstasing.
[01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:00.560]   - All right.
[01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:01.880]   - Yep.
[01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:04.520]   - This just scared the hell out of me and disgusting.
[01:01:04.520 --> 01:01:05.360]   - It doesn't scare me.
[01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:06.600]   - I'm trying to write a post right now.
[01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:08.480]   There's a brilliant academic I know,
[01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:11.360]   and I'm trying to be delicate in this pile of papers
[01:01:11.360 --> 01:01:14.000]   that I'm reading right now, academic papers,
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:15.000]   who's trying to argue-
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:15.840]   - Absolutely.
[01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:17.000]   - Against the First Amendment,
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:19.480]   because too much speech is a bad thing.
[01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:20.320]   - That's wrong.
[01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:21.480]   - And when you go into research,
[01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:24.400]   you look at things like Rasmus Klesen-Nielsson-Oxford,
[01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:26.640]   is very good at saying, give the evidence people.
[01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:28.680]   There's this presumption that everybody thinks
[01:01:28.680 --> 01:01:30.360]   we're in filter bubbles, right?
[01:01:30.360 --> 01:01:31.560]   And ever since the book was written,
[01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:32.600]   we're all in filter bubbles.
[01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:33.960]   The research is not showing that.
[01:01:33.960 --> 01:01:36.320]   I've been going through tons of research here
[01:01:36.320 --> 01:01:39.520]   that talks about the evidence of where we really are.
[01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:42.480]   And so I'm gonna be pretty, yeah, I'm gonna be demanding.
[01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:43.600]   If you're gonna do a story like this,
[01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:44.760]   it is purely speculative.
[01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:46.120]   At least be right about the facts.
[01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:47.120]   - Well, what about this Pew-
[01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:48.120]   - What about this Pew-
[01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:49.680]   - What about this Pew status?
[01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:50.680]   - Statistics, 74%.
[01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:51.880]   - Well, I saw that today,
[01:01:51.880 --> 01:01:54.800]   and I wanna look up the methodology and questioning.
[01:01:54.800 --> 01:01:56.360]   How many surveys do we have?
[01:01:56.360 --> 01:01:58.320]   90% of people don't know we're on high.
[01:01:58.320 --> 01:02:01.600]   - 963 Facebook users aged 18 and older.
[01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:02.680]   - I wanna look at the question,
[01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:04.280]   in the form of the question.
[01:02:04.280 --> 01:02:05.720]   So what is that, you?
[01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:09.280]   - My experience with Pew's research
[01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:11.160]   has been that it's pretty good, but-
[01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:12.480]   - Pretty good, but I've had problems.
[01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:13.760]   I have had civic issues.
[01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:15.440]   - Well, sure, because it's,
[01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:18.400]   James Kerry, my hero,
[01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:22.400]   in these matters, who says the democracy is conversation,
[01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:25.800]   he says the ruling of democracy is the public opinion survey.
[01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:27.040]   Because it cuts off the-
[01:02:27.040 --> 01:02:27.880]   - I completely agree with you.
[01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:30.080]   - Conversation that it is meant to inform.
[01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:30.920]   - Does it seem-
[01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:33.880]   - And it starts with the bias and the agenda of the question.
[01:02:33.880 --> 01:02:35.240]   - Does it seem impossible though,
[01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:36.920]   that three quarters of Facebook users
[01:02:36.920 --> 01:02:39.760]   aren't really aware of what Facebook is doing?
[01:02:39.760 --> 01:02:40.800]   - I would put the same question,
[01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:42.840]   are they aware of what media is really doing?
[01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:46.160]   Why should they be aware of how advertising structures work?
[01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:48.480]   - Right, Facebook has a very different presence
[01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:51.360]   in their lives and much more influence than-
[01:02:51.360 --> 01:02:53.320]   - You're not giving the New York Times anywhere near
[01:02:53.320 --> 01:02:55.080]   the kind of information you're giving Facebook.
[01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:56.080]   - A point you do.
[01:02:56.080 --> 01:02:59.400]   - So what if the New York Times is trying to give you a,
[01:02:59.400 --> 01:03:00.920]   they do it by your zip code.
[01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:02.720]   They're not doing it by everything-
[01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:05.080]   - Point you to Yokai, wait, Stacey, what Stacey just settled.
[01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:07.720]   Point you to Yokai Beckler's brilliant new book about this,
[01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:11.560]   where he has data that shows the influence of Fox News
[01:03:11.560 --> 01:03:15.280]   being greater for where we are right now than that of Facebook.
[01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:16.120]   That's a presumption-
[01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:17.120]   - Wait, Fox News is not-
[01:03:17.120 --> 01:03:20.440]   - Facebook is not the New York Times.
[01:03:20.440 --> 01:03:21.280]   - Well, it's-
[01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:22.880]   - It's also- - It's not either or-
[01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:24.320]   - I mean, sorry, Fox News is not the-
[01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:29.320]   - I think Facebook and Fox News both could be a problem, right?
[01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:32.240]   - And no one would-
[01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:34.840]   - Does Bankler say it's not a problem?
[01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:36.680]   - I think, I think Fox News is a horrible problem.
[01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:37.680]   - Does Bankler say that-
[01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:38.520]   - But I'm not suggesting that we-
[01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:39.360]   - Facebook was not-
[01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:40.200]   - Facebook was not-
[01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:41.040]   - was not a news channel.
[01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:43.600]   - No one is, well, maybe they are, I don't know.
[01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:45.560]   That would be a mistake.
[01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:46.400]   - And you had-
[01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:47.720]   - Where did the speech come into this?
[01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:48.560]   - That we were-
[01:03:48.560 --> 01:03:49.960]   - That was just yesterday.
[01:03:49.960 --> 01:03:52.120]   - We just went back to Leo's point, sorry Stacey,
[01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:53.400]   but there's one point.
[01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:55.000]   Congress just yesterday,
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.440]   various people going against the platforms
[01:03:57.440 --> 01:04:00.760]   for the supposed anti-right-wing bias they have
[01:04:00.760 --> 01:04:04.640]   and how they ought to be censored by government.
[01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:07.680]   That is against the first amendment.
[01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:09.120]   - Yes, I agree 100%.
[01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:10.880]   - And by God, I'm gonna stand up
[01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:12.560]   and I'm gonna defend the first amendment
[01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:14.240]   and speech against that kind of talk.
[01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:16.320]   And that kind of talk comes out of panic.
[01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:18.480]   - I wanna talk about your slippery slope here
[01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:20.160]   because I see that you've got one
[01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:23.880]   and I understand why you're leaning so hard on this,
[01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:25.920]   but walk me down that slope.
[01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:29.320]   How does this lead to the end of free speech?
[01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:35.000]   - So we end up in a world of regulation
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.600]   and we see the beginnings of it in Europe.
[01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:39.400]   So you have, for example, the right to be forgotten,
[01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:41.880]   which as a journalist and an academic of sorts,
[01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:43.760]   some kind of fake academic,
[01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:46.920]   I find utterly offensive to rewrite history,
[01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:48.920]   to erase history, Europe of all places
[01:04:48.920 --> 01:04:50.720]   should recognize the danger of that.
[01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:53.480]   And ironically, in an effort to take power away
[01:04:53.480 --> 01:04:56.480]   from Google, it only gave Google more power.
[01:04:56.480 --> 01:05:01.480]   The law that's too long for even me to pronounce in German,
[01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:04.200]   that's the anti-hate speech law
[01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:06.520]   that has led to the hiring of 30,000 people
[01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:08.080]   at Facebook to deal with this,
[01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:09.960]   they get 24 hours to make a judgment.
[01:05:09.960 --> 01:05:13.040]   What happens is that satire is killed
[01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:15.360]   because anybody who's sitting there
[01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:17.840]   on a low-paying job going through this crap,
[01:05:17.840 --> 01:05:19.320]   if you have the slightest doubt
[01:05:19.320 --> 01:05:21.960]   as to whether or not this is bad, kill it.
[01:05:21.960 --> 01:05:24.520]   And that's what's happening right now in Germany,
[01:05:24.520 --> 01:05:26.320]   a country that I would hope would care
[01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:28.160]   about free speech and understand the value of that.
[01:05:28.160 --> 01:05:30.840]   - Surely you're not being absolute.
[01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:32.720]   - But surely you're not being absolutist on this,
[01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:35.640]   saying because of these, clearly misguided,
[01:05:35.640 --> 01:05:37.360]   misdirected laws,
[01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:40.200]   there should be no regulation at all.
[01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:41.720]   - Did I say this with no regulation at all?
[01:05:41.720 --> 01:05:42.560]   - No.
[01:05:42.560 --> 01:05:43.400]   - I didn't say this before.
[01:05:43.400 --> 01:05:44.240]   - So what we're saying--
[01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:45.720]   - We already have laws
[01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:47.360]   for most of all the things that we matter.
[01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:51.080]   These are special laws 'cause technology is specially scary.
[01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:53.080]   No, this is about human behavior
[01:05:53.080 --> 01:05:54.480]   where no matter where it occurs
[01:05:54.480 --> 01:05:55.320]   and we have laws that regularly--
[01:05:55.320 --> 01:05:56.680]   - It's the other way around, Jeff.
[01:05:56.680 --> 01:05:57.920]   I'll give you an example.
[01:05:57.920 --> 01:06:02.280]   It's the Honest Ads Act.
[01:06:02.280 --> 01:06:03.240]   It's the other way around.
[01:06:03.240 --> 01:06:06.200]   Technology's been given a pass in many cases.
[01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:09.320]   As you well know, a mainstream media has to reveal
[01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:11.920]   who bought a political ad on television and radio.
[01:06:11.920 --> 01:06:13.600]   Facebook does not.
[01:06:13.600 --> 01:06:16.040]   And any attempt to get Facebook to reveal that
[01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:18.200]   has been thwarted, including the Honest Ads Act--
[01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:20.840]   - Going up now and they're backing the Honest Ads Act.
[01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:22.560]   - They did not-- - They're not the law.
[01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:25.200]   - Well, and thank goodness that people put them,
[01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:26.560]   put their feet to the fire.
[01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:30.120]   So it isn't the case that technology is being--
[01:06:30.120 --> 01:06:31.200]   - I think that the Honest Ads act--
[01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:32.680]   - Persecuted, it's the opposite.
[01:06:32.680 --> 01:06:34.320]   - It would be a--
[01:06:34.320 --> 01:06:36.440]   - In many cases, it's the opposite.
[01:06:36.440 --> 01:06:39.840]   Amazon didn't have to pay any sales tax for years.
[01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:42.800]   - Well, again, who do you blame for that?
[01:06:42.800 --> 01:06:44.160]   You blame legislators.
[01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:45.920]   - I'm just pointing out, you're acting as if,
[01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:48.520]   oh, we're all coming down on technology 'cause it's special.
[01:06:48.520 --> 01:06:50.360]   I think you could just as well make the case
[01:06:50.360 --> 01:06:53.200]   that technology has gotten a pass because it's special.
[01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:55.360]   - I agreed with Stacey in many ways it has
[01:06:55.360 --> 01:06:59.800]   and I also said that this is well part of the public discussion.
[01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:03.000]   But I want it to be evidence-based.
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:06.080]   I hardly recommend Joachai Beckler's book to get a sense of--
[01:07:06.080 --> 01:07:06.920]   - That's a good point.
[01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:07.920]   - How we end up here.
[01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:09.920]   - Unless maybe article is not--
[01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:11.040]   - It's not an evidence.
[01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:13.720]   It's a maybe article and that's probably--
[01:07:13.720 --> 01:07:14.720]   - That's what poor journalists--
[01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:16.040]   - That's what bothered me so much about this.
[01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:18.520]   Because, and it is in an atmosphere
[01:07:18.520 --> 01:07:20.120]   of people being panicked about this
[01:07:20.120 --> 01:07:23.120]   and it used a non-event to stir up
[01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:27.000]   more speculative, paranoiaic panic about this
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:28.880]   and that's irresponsible.
[01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:31.880]   So be evidence-based, especially from a journalistic organization.
[01:07:31.880 --> 01:07:33.320]   And again, I like Wired.
[01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:34.760]   - No, that's it.
[01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:35.760]   - Wired is excellent.
[01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:37.240]   Nick is an excellent editor.
[01:07:37.240 --> 01:07:38.760]   He's done superb work.
[01:07:38.760 --> 01:07:42.000]   This is a specific criticism, but this was off today
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:46.080]   and I was highly disappointed in history and in Wired.
[01:07:46.080 --> 01:07:49.320]   - I think we can, I think Stacey would agree too, right?
[01:07:49.320 --> 01:07:51.400]   I mean, this is about journal,
[01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:53.280]   in that case it's about journalistic standards.
[01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:57.240]   Articles shouldn't be based on that kind of flimsy conjecture.
[01:07:57.240 --> 01:07:58.920]   - It's about ethics and gaming.
[01:07:58.920 --> 01:08:00.000]   (laughing)
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:00.840]   Sorry.
[01:08:00.840 --> 01:08:04.320]   - Don't start there, baby.
[01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:06.640]   We're gonna have some real problems here.
[01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:09.040]   (laughing)
[01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:10.200]   - You think you have problems now?
[01:08:10.200 --> 01:08:15.200]   - I think the editorial or these kind of speculative articles
[01:08:15.200 --> 01:08:18.480]   are a time-honored journalistic tradition.
[01:08:18.480 --> 01:08:20.160]   I think they followed all the rules.
[01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:21.840]   They don't assess that it's fat.
[01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:23.160]   - They were very clear.
[01:08:23.160 --> 01:08:24.600]   - They were very clear in the first lead
[01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:26.680]   and I know you took issue with this tweet.
[01:08:26.680 --> 01:08:28.120]   People do take issue with tweets.
[01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:29.960]   - That's the problem with tweets.
[01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:30.800]   It's not just tweets.
[01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:31.640]   People take issue with--
[01:08:31.640 --> 01:08:33.880]   - No nuance in tweets or headlines.
[01:08:33.880 --> 01:08:35.880]   - We can't presume anymore.
[01:08:35.880 --> 01:08:38.120]   This is an ethical thing.
[01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:40.440]   We should not presume anymore
[01:08:40.440 --> 01:08:43.240]   that people click and read the article.
[01:08:43.240 --> 01:08:44.160]   - No, that's true too.
[01:08:44.160 --> 01:08:46.840]   - The entry has to be complete enough
[01:08:46.840 --> 01:08:48.640]   and correct enough in and of itself.
[01:08:48.640 --> 01:08:50.720]   The AP gets in huge trouble for this.
[01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:53.640]   - Which you, okay, so that is a very different issue.
[01:08:53.640 --> 01:08:55.720]   - I've actually had this problem with Wired in the past
[01:08:55.720 --> 01:08:58.160]   and maybe this should have been an opinion piece
[01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:00.800]   and labeled as such.
[01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:03.120]   - Even then, even then.
[01:09:03.120 --> 01:09:04.120]   - No, it's an opinion piece.
[01:09:04.120 --> 01:09:05.320]   - It's still based on a presumption
[01:09:05.320 --> 01:09:06.600]   of something that turns out to be false.
[01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:08.200]   - Well, as often opinion pieces are.
[01:09:08.200 --> 01:09:09.400]   - Yeah, but she says it.
[01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:10.240]   - Oh, it is.
[01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:11.760]   Wait a minute, I'm sorry.
[01:09:11.760 --> 01:09:14.120]   Wired opinion. - Yeah, it is an opinion piece.
[01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:16.640]   - All of them speeches have been ever heard.
[01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:17.640]   - This is journalism.
[01:09:17.640 --> 01:09:19.320]   - Well, it's not, but it's really a reportage.
[01:09:19.320 --> 01:09:21.200]   It's an opinion piece.
[01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:24.960]   - Based on a wrong presumption.
[01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:25.880]   - No, it is.
[01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:26.720]   - Resumption. - Okay.
[01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:27.760]   - Yes, it is.
[01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:30.720]   - It is not, she's not saying
[01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:32.400]   that it's a correct presumption.
[01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:35.040]   She's saying it is her presumption.
[01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:36.920]   - It's almost a what if.
[01:09:36.920 --> 01:09:38.160]   - It could happen.
[01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:39.160]   - Yeah, but it's a what if.
[01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:42.360]   - But that's a probably good hit us.
[01:09:42.360 --> 01:09:44.600]   - I'll grant you Stacy, that is a long standing
[01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:47.000]   journalist or tradition in opinion pieces.
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:48.360]   - And this is an opinion piece.
[01:09:48.360 --> 01:09:49.200]   - This is not a news story.
[01:09:49.200 --> 01:09:51.240]   - This is part of the reason that no one trusts us,
[01:09:51.240 --> 01:09:53.800]   which is what I battle against out of a journalism school.
[01:09:53.800 --> 01:09:56.880]   - Well, maybe, Zach, maybe Wired like the Wall Street Journal
[01:09:56.880 --> 01:09:57.720]   in the New York Times.
[01:09:57.720 --> 01:10:00.080]   It needs a separate op-ed section
[01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:02.000]   so that you know what you're reading.
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:03.840]   That is a big problem nowadays, by the way.
[01:10:03.840 --> 01:10:05.160]   You can't tell.
[01:10:05.160 --> 01:10:07.120]   - All articles. - Even down.
[01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:08.200]   - Even that. - This is social.
[01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:11.040]   - There's still standards in an opinion section.
[01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:14.280]   - Well, you can ask a what if question and opinion.
[01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:18.400]   - This is not, I don't find this as egregious as you, Jeff.
[01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:22.200]   In fact, I find your passion about this absolutely baffling.
[01:10:22.200 --> 01:10:26.240]   - But. - I find your disagreement baffling.
[01:10:27.080 --> 01:10:28.080]   (laughing)
[01:10:28.080 --> 01:10:31.080]   - No, I just, I mean, I'm just kind of like, wow.
[01:10:31.080 --> 01:10:33.480]   - This is a hot one for Jeff, honestly.
[01:10:33.480 --> 01:10:35.800]   - I stopped the car today.
[01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:40.320]   I stopped the car and I read that tweet at a stoplight
[01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:41.840]   in a trade horrible traffic.
[01:10:41.840 --> 01:10:43.160]   When I got someplace where I could stop,
[01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:46.120]   I stopped, I read the article, I read the tweet again,
[01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:49.320]   and I stopped right there to the point of responding to this.
[01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:50.680]   I was so upset about it.
[01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:52.920]   - Maybe you should, well, no, okay.
[01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:54.360]   You'd let's talk about something else
[01:10:54.360 --> 01:10:57.800]   because if you wanna talk about my hot button issues.
[01:10:57.800 --> 01:10:59.280]   - What's your hot button issues?
[01:10:59.280 --> 01:11:01.600]   - I need my oral ring to see what happened to my pulse
[01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:03.640]   in the last 20 minutes.
[01:11:03.640 --> 01:11:04.960]   - Your watch says you did.
[01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:05.800]   - Did you see?
[01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:07.120]   (laughing)
[01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:10.040]   - Did you see the Verizon remind story?
[01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:11.280]   It's in Ars Technica.
[01:11:11.280 --> 01:11:13.520]   Someone had emailed me about it being a net neutrality,
[01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:16.960]   or no, tweeted me about it being a net neutrality violation.
[01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:19.680]   And what this is, is basically a failure
[01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:24.080]   to regulate not the tech industry, but the carriers.
[01:11:24.080 --> 01:11:26.200]   And it's a fascinating story,
[01:11:26.200 --> 01:11:27.960]   and it's a fascinating policy issue.
[01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:30.840]   - Is this the Verizon Angers Teachers story?
[01:11:30.840 --> 01:11:32.200]   - Yes, it is Verizon Angers.
[01:11:32.200 --> 01:11:33.040]   - Is Verizon-- - Is Verizon--
[01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:34.120]   - No? - I haven't seen it.
[01:11:34.120 --> 01:11:38.440]   No, Verizon charges new spam fee for texts
[01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:39.960]   sent from teachers to students.
[01:11:39.960 --> 01:11:42.640]   Is this in the wake of the FCC's ruling
[01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:47.640]   that text messages are, what do they call it,
[01:11:47.640 --> 01:11:50.680]   publishing, not publishing?
[01:11:50.680 --> 01:11:51.520]   I can't remember.
[01:11:51.520 --> 01:11:54.400]   They are not, they are an information service
[01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:56.480]   as opposed to something that should be governed by it.
[01:11:56.480 --> 01:11:59.080]   So they are like-- - So which gives the carriers
[01:11:59.080 --> 01:12:01.520]   like Verizon the right to do this, in other words?
[01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:03.120]   - Right, it basically gives them,
[01:12:03.120 --> 01:12:05.120]   and I would argue-- - Why did the FCC
[01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:07.000]   pull that background first, background first?
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:08.440]   - Oh, it's actually a pie.
[01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:11.000]   - And this is what, what we're-- - What's the question?
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:12.960]   - Two words, "adget pie."
[01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:14.960]   - Right, I guess the way you know.
[01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:16.920]   - Who you thought was gonna be okay.
[01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:17.840]   But I'm not gonna rub it in.
[01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:20.120]   - You're gonna, you're gonna really be upset
[01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:22.720]   when I say that what really happened, which is,
[01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:25.440]   that "adget pie" felt that-- (laughs)
[01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:29.000]   Well, ostensibly the idea was we can cut spam
[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:33.160]   if we let carriers decide what spam and text messages,
[01:12:33.160 --> 01:12:35.040]   give them the power to cut spam,
[01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:39.040]   but the thinking really is that they would like to,
[01:12:39.040 --> 01:12:42.160]   and they have in the past, censor political speech
[01:12:42.160 --> 01:12:47.160]   that is not a, you know, a menable to certain groups.
[01:12:47.640 --> 01:12:49.340]   Like the, the, the, the, the, the, the,
[01:12:49.340 --> 01:12:50.640]   narrow, narrow, I can't say it.
[01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:53.040]   - Narrow, yeah, that was what happened was,
[01:12:53.040 --> 01:12:54.400]   I can't remember which carrier, BAN--
[01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:55.320]   - It was Verizon.
[01:12:55.320 --> 01:12:56.320]   - Verizon? - It was Verizon.
[01:12:56.320 --> 01:12:57.240]   - It was Verizon again.
[01:12:57.240 --> 01:13:01.520]   BAN text messages from the Right to Life organization.
[01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:02.680]   Right, that's narrow, right?
[01:13:02.680 --> 01:13:03.520]   National Hall. - Yeah.
[01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:04.960]   - Oh, I see it. - No, no, no, no,
[01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:07.000]   it's the Right to Life.
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:08.240]   - Right to choice. - Right to choice.
[01:13:08.240 --> 01:13:09.840]   - Right to choice. - Narrow is choice.
[01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:10.680]   I can't think of this.
[01:13:10.680 --> 01:13:12.840]   This is such an old debate now, right?
[01:13:12.840 --> 01:13:14.360]   The, but it's coming back.
[01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:19.360]   The, so they've blocked anti-pro-abortion messages.
[01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:21.880]   - So that's, so this is the, this is the political--
[01:13:21.880 --> 01:13:22.720]   - Right, they've got the double-legged,
[01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:23.560]   they're a straight note.
[01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:25.480]   - They blocked pro-abortion messages.
[01:13:25.480 --> 01:13:26.320]   - I believe that's what happened.
[01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:27.160]   - Right, that is what happened.
[01:13:27.160 --> 01:13:29.000]   - Narrow is a choice organization, yeah.
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:30.080]   - Yeah, but-- - But--
[01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:30.920]   - So first things you think--
[01:13:30.920 --> 01:13:32.480]   - I was going to get back on first.
[01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:34.380]   - No, please. - So, remind is a free
[01:13:34.380 --> 01:13:37.880]   texting service used by teachers, students, and parents,
[01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:41.720]   but there's a dispute over the fees for Verizon demanded
[01:13:41.720 --> 01:13:44.400]   for the company that operates the service.
[01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:46.320]   As a result, teachers have been expressing
[01:13:46.320 --> 01:13:48.840]   their displeasure with Verizon.
[01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:52.640]   Remind the company that offers the service
[01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:56.720]   criticized Verizon for charging a new fee.
[01:13:56.720 --> 01:13:58.680]   Its services text message notifications
[01:13:58.680 --> 01:14:02.560]   will stop working on Verizon unless Verizon changes course.
[01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:06.840]   Verizon says the fee must be charged to fund spam blocking
[01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:09.680]   services. - Are we all being charged this fee?
[01:14:09.680 --> 01:14:10.520]   - Just remind-- - Just remind.
[01:14:10.520 --> 01:14:11.600]   - Just remind.
[01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:15.040]   So it's basically Twilio who is sending out these messages
[01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:17.680]   as being charged to-- - Oh, the carriers hate Twilio.
[01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:20.080]   - Yes, now here's the deal.
[01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:23.400]   The political reason is a you should be able to not
[01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:25.960]   push messages you don't think are right, whatever.
[01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:29.400]   The economic message, which is the real message here,
[01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:32.560]   the real rationale for this is they can double dip.
[01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:35.160]   So I pay for text messaging.
[01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:38.240]   These companies already, like Twilio already pays
[01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:39.320]   to send text messages.
[01:14:39.320 --> 01:14:41.200]   They get on the Verizon network, they're paying already.
[01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:45.760]   - Yeah, but now Verizon can charge more people.
[01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:47.160]   They can charge them again.
[01:14:47.160 --> 01:14:49.840]   - So Remind has a free plan, but it also has a paid plan.
[01:14:49.840 --> 01:14:53.360]   So it's a typical business where it's a freemium business.
[01:14:53.360 --> 01:14:56.200]   Twilio does have to pay to get access to Verizon network,
[01:14:56.200 --> 01:14:58.800]   but they're hoping they'll make that recoup that money.
[01:14:58.800 --> 01:15:01.320]   Reminds costs right now for sending messages
[01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:02.400]   to Verizon customers.
[01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:04.520]   Whereas a few hundred thousand dollars a year,
[01:15:04.520 --> 01:15:07.560]   it will go to several million dollars a year
[01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:08.800]   after this change.
[01:15:09.800 --> 01:15:10.640]   - Reminds.
[01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:14.680]   - There isn't really a problem with the teachers' messages.
[01:15:14.680 --> 01:15:16.640]   They're just caught in this vise of this vise.
[01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:21.200]   - Yes, they're a wonderful test case for this
[01:15:21.200 --> 01:15:24.120]   because who does, and Verizon is, they say,
[01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:27.160]   hey, we will work with individual schools.
[01:15:27.160 --> 01:15:30.760]   We just don't want to work with this company
[01:15:30.760 --> 01:15:32.120]   and them are still negotiating this.
[01:15:32.120 --> 01:15:35.160]   - And actually, technically it's Verizon's charging Twilio.
[01:15:35.160 --> 01:15:36.000]   - Yes.
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:36.840]   - Extra.
[01:15:36.840 --> 01:15:38.840]   But now Twilio isn't passing,
[01:15:38.840 --> 01:15:42.200]   they are just passing that fee along to remind.
[01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:43.200]   They are not charging anything else.
[01:15:43.200 --> 01:15:44.040]   - Why did they hate Twilio?
[01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:45.040]   Does it send spam or not?
[01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:46.160]   - No, Twilio.
[01:15:46.160 --> 01:15:51.440]   - They hate Twilio because Twilio basically offers
[01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:55.120]   an easier and more developer friendly way
[01:15:55.120 --> 01:15:56.920]   to get telecommunication services
[01:15:56.920 --> 01:15:58.600]   'cause the carriers never did it.
[01:15:58.600 --> 01:15:59.600]   - Apart from text.
[01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:02.440]   - Twilio is basically a communications API.
[01:16:02.440 --> 01:16:06.600]   So if I wanted to send spam, not spam,
[01:16:06.600 --> 01:16:09.120]   I'm sorry, broadcast messages to our listeners
[01:16:09.120 --> 01:16:10.440]   were about to begin Twig,
[01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:13.160]   I would use a service like Twilio to do.
[01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:18.160]   - Yeah, and to be clear, Twilio has been used by spam.
[01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:20.520]   And actually, when I talk to people in DC
[01:16:20.520 --> 01:16:24.120]   in the lobbying industry or lobbyists and politicians in DC,
[01:16:24.120 --> 01:16:27.720]   they actually think Twilio is spam because they,
[01:16:27.720 --> 01:16:31.920]   only the carriers have the lobbying power.
[01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:34.080]   So they come in and they talk about how,
[01:16:34.080 --> 01:16:35.480]   they don't hear from everybody else.
[01:16:35.480 --> 01:16:37.640]   - Twilio is great, in my opinion.
[01:16:37.640 --> 01:16:40.280]   Twilio is a high tech solution to something
[01:16:40.280 --> 01:16:43.680]   that the carriers never wanted people to use.
[01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:46.520]   They just wanted, they wanna make their SMS money
[01:16:46.520 --> 01:16:49.920]   and this is a good solution.
[01:16:49.920 --> 01:16:53.200]   - Yeah, so this is a frustrating story for,
[01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:55.160]   this is where regulation,
[01:16:55.160 --> 01:16:59.040]   the fact that we have taken a hands off approach here,
[01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:01.280]   this is how the other side not,
[01:17:01.280 --> 01:17:03.480]   I mean, takes advantage of that.
[01:17:03.480 --> 01:17:04.800]   And there's always gonna be someone
[01:17:04.800 --> 01:17:06.080]   taking advantage of regulation.
[01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:08.000]   I mean, this. - Yeah, and do you think Twilio,
[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:08.840]   I don't know this,
[01:17:08.840 --> 01:17:10.520]   but do you think Twilio has done a bad job
[01:17:10.520 --> 01:17:12.320]   of blocking spam on their network?
[01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:15.320]   - Well, Twilio, anybody can pay to send
[01:17:15.320 --> 01:17:17.400]   gajillion messages over Twilio, right?
[01:17:17.400 --> 01:17:21.280]   Twilio does not have, to my knowledge, they do not--
[01:17:21.280 --> 01:17:22.600]   - They don't even look.
[01:17:22.600 --> 01:17:26.360]   - Yeah, our legit, like, remind, I'm sure has people opt in.
[01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:27.920]   It sounds like they have people opt in
[01:17:27.920 --> 01:17:29.720]   to like, or want this via email or text.
[01:17:29.720 --> 01:17:32.120]   So there are plenty of good Twilio customers,
[01:17:32.120 --> 01:17:34.640]   but Twilio is a service.
[01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:36.720]   And I'm sure people are using Twilio
[01:17:36.720 --> 01:17:37.720]   for all sorts of terrible things.
[01:17:37.720 --> 01:17:39.360]   - So here's an update.
[01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:41.440]   Twilio says now that it's switching
[01:17:41.440 --> 01:17:44.520]   to a new Verizon service designed specifically
[01:17:44.520 --> 01:17:47.200]   for commercial long-code messaging,
[01:17:47.200 --> 01:17:50.960]   and that Verizon's averaging a termination surcharge
[01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:55.960]   of .0025 cents per mobile terminated SMS message.
[01:17:55.960 --> 01:18:00.120]   So they're charging per message, small amount,
[01:18:00.120 --> 01:18:02.920]   but that adds up when you send millions of messages.
[01:18:02.920 --> 01:18:05.360]   All providers, not just Twilio are impacted equally
[01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:07.880]   by this fee that Verizon is instituting.
[01:18:07.880 --> 01:18:10.000]   Twilio has made the decision to pass along the fee
[01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:13.080]   without any markup, but it believes a similar fee
[01:18:13.080 --> 01:18:15.560]   may be imposed for terminating long-code traffic.
[01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:17.600]   Terminating doesn't mean ending in this case,
[01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:20.240]   but using, basically, long-code traffic--
[01:18:20.240 --> 01:18:23.400]   - Right, and Twilio says it sends,
[01:18:23.400 --> 01:18:27.120]   or Verizon says Twilio sends more than 4.5 billion texts
[01:18:27.120 --> 01:18:28.560]   a year on the Verizon network.
[01:18:28.560 --> 01:18:32.880]   - Somebody do the math, .0025 times 4.5 billion.
[01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:35.520]   - That's right. - That's millions.
[01:18:35.520 --> 01:18:38.960]   - So that's per year? - Yeah.
[01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:40.880]   - I don't know, I'm not doing that math.
[01:18:40.880 --> 01:18:43.160]   - What do they think, what do the carriers think
[01:18:43.160 --> 01:18:46.320]   about Apple and Google enabling?
[01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:48.240]   - Oh, they hate them.
[01:18:48.240 --> 01:18:49.840]   They hate all of these companies.
[01:18:49.840 --> 01:18:52.160]   - Well, and one of the reasons people use Twilio
[01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:55.120]   is because it's not just SMS, you could use messages
[01:18:55.120 --> 01:18:57.680]   or WhatsApp or voice and other things.
[01:18:57.680 --> 01:18:59.840]   - And it's got APIs, it's easily--
[01:18:59.840 --> 01:19:00.680]   - Twilio's awesome, I think.
[01:19:00.680 --> 01:19:02.680]   - Programmable, I mean, it's everything
[01:19:02.680 --> 01:19:07.680]   the carriers aren't, it's everything the carriers wanted
[01:19:07.680 --> 01:19:09.640]   to, not wanted to be.
[01:19:09.640 --> 01:19:12.440]   It's like, the carriers, I always look at them
[01:19:12.440 --> 01:19:14.080]   and I'm like, they're the antithesis
[01:19:14.080 --> 01:19:16.920]   of the way tech has grown up.
[01:19:16.920 --> 01:19:18.560]   So tech has always grown up with,
[01:19:18.560 --> 01:19:20.400]   we make something easier and cheaper,
[01:19:20.400 --> 01:19:23.560]   people will use more of it and people will buy more of it.
[01:19:23.560 --> 01:19:26.200]   - Carriers say, let's make it harder and more expensive.
[01:19:26.200 --> 01:19:27.040]   - Yeah.
[01:19:27.040 --> 01:19:28.480]   (laughing)
[01:19:28.480 --> 01:19:32.640]   - I just, I don't, it baffles me, it really, truly does.
[01:19:32.640 --> 01:19:36.440]   And they do have actual constraints, but they also,
[01:19:36.440 --> 01:19:37.280]   I am--
[01:19:37.280 --> 01:19:38.360]   - Well, this is the interface.
[01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:39.520]   - You and the carriers, Jeff.
[01:19:39.520 --> 01:19:40.360]   - This is always the--
[01:19:40.360 --> 01:19:44.320]   - This is always the fight of the old incumbents
[01:19:44.320 --> 01:19:47.120]   against the, you know, upstart internet.
[01:19:47.120 --> 01:19:49.600]   - Well, it's not just that, I mean, look at Intel
[01:19:49.600 --> 01:19:53.600]   with their processors, Intel paid in funded companies
[01:19:53.600 --> 01:19:56.320]   to use their silicon, so they would actually be able
[01:19:56.320 --> 01:20:00.080]   to produce more of it and buy, I mean, they started
[01:20:00.080 --> 01:20:03.320]   the entire compute revolution with things like Moore's Law
[01:20:03.320 --> 01:20:05.200]   and trying to produce things more cheaply
[01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:07.520]   so people would buy more of it.
[01:20:07.520 --> 01:20:09.200]   It's just a different economic model.
[01:20:09.200 --> 01:20:11.760]   And the carriers have actually,
[01:20:11.760 --> 01:20:14.440]   they're starting to adopt it with the iPhone,
[01:20:14.440 --> 01:20:16.720]   that forced them to do a lot to change
[01:20:16.720 --> 01:20:19.120]   how they think about things, but they haven't,
[01:20:19.120 --> 01:20:20.600]   not everybody's gone yet, right?
[01:20:20.600 --> 01:20:23.520]   Not all the old carrier dudes have retired,
[01:20:23.520 --> 01:20:26.880]   but I mean, things like software to find networking
[01:20:26.880 --> 01:20:30.760]   were such a, they had the potential to be such a benefit
[01:20:30.760 --> 01:20:33.920]   to carriers, but they didn't adopt it for almost a decade.
[01:20:33.920 --> 01:20:35.960]   And the idea that they could actually produce
[01:20:35.960 --> 01:20:40.320]   telecommunications for like, lower the cost per bit,
[01:20:40.320 --> 01:20:42.320]   they weren't interested in that.
[01:20:42.320 --> 01:20:45.080]   That wasn't what they saw themselves as doing.
[01:20:45.080 --> 01:20:46.680]   Whereas someone like Google or Facebook,
[01:20:46.680 --> 01:20:50.320]   you're like, that's your cost of goods sold, right?
[01:20:50.320 --> 01:20:53.280]   And you wanna get that as low as possible,
[01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:55.720]   and they're like optimizing like heck for that.
[01:20:55.720 --> 01:20:57.040]   The carriers never thought that way.
[01:20:57.040 --> 01:21:01.520]   They just think about maximizing their revenue per user.
[01:21:01.520 --> 01:21:02.360]   Like Apple.
[01:21:02.360 --> 01:21:05.120]   Yeah, kind of maybe.
[01:21:05.120 --> 01:21:07.880]   I've never done a study, I've never done a study of Apple
[01:21:07.880 --> 01:21:08.960]   from that perspective.
[01:21:08.960 --> 01:21:10.720]   The new Apple.
[01:21:10.720 --> 01:21:12.920]   It's time for, get the trumpets ready,
[01:21:12.920 --> 01:21:14.360]   prepare the drums.
[01:21:14.360 --> 01:21:17.720]   The Google change log.
[01:21:17.720 --> 01:21:19.960]   The Google change log.
[01:21:22.960 --> 01:21:27.440]   RCS comes to Google Fi.
[01:21:27.440 --> 01:21:28.920]   Fits right into this conversation.
[01:21:28.920 --> 01:21:32.080]   Rich communication services.
[01:21:32.080 --> 01:21:34.320]   This is something the carriers have been slow to adopt.
[01:21:34.320 --> 01:21:36.000]   Google's been pushing hard.
[01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:40.280]   Because Apple messages can do so much more than SMS.
[01:21:40.280 --> 01:21:42.760]   So they really want everybody to use RCS.
[01:21:42.760 --> 01:21:45.760]   I like RCS, 'cause I like Apple messages.
[01:21:45.760 --> 01:21:50.000]   It is now available on Fi and compatible,
[01:21:50.000 --> 01:21:52.960]   phones designed for Fi and compatible Android iPhones
[01:21:52.960 --> 01:21:55.520]   if you're using Google Fi.
[01:21:55.520 --> 01:21:59.480]   So, Google's crazy messaging strategy.
[01:21:59.480 --> 01:22:04.480]   I changed my messaging from Hangouts on my Pixel
[01:22:04.480 --> 01:22:06.720]   to Android messages.
[01:22:06.720 --> 01:22:11.000]   Because, and then in order to get it on an iPhone,
[01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:15.120]   I now have to use a webpage to get my name.
[01:22:15.120 --> 01:22:19.480]   How do I know like, how do I, you can use it?
[01:22:19.480 --> 01:22:20.760]   You can.
[01:22:20.760 --> 01:22:22.520]   So what about you doing to use it?
[01:22:22.520 --> 01:22:24.360]   Well, you're switching to messages, basically.
[01:22:24.360 --> 01:22:25.640]   No, I've gone long, long messages.
[01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:26.600]   Oh, then you've got it.
[01:22:26.600 --> 01:22:27.600]   It's automatic.
[01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:28.800]   But how do I know that?
[01:22:28.800 --> 01:22:30.080]   I feel like I have a magic power.
[01:22:30.080 --> 01:22:30.880]   You can do cool things.
[01:22:30.880 --> 01:22:32.200]   Nobody told me about it.
[01:22:32.200 --> 01:22:35.800]   You can do things like embed links from maps,
[01:22:35.800 --> 01:22:37.720]   or drop a pin, that kind of thing.
[01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:42.440]   You can share high-res videos, not downgraded videos.
[01:22:42.440 --> 01:22:43.280]   When you--
[01:22:43.280 --> 01:22:43.960]   Related?
[01:22:43.960 --> 01:22:46.440]   My husband asked me, are you at the doctor right now?
[01:22:46.440 --> 01:22:48.400]   And Google automatically threw up,
[01:22:48.400 --> 01:22:49.960]   hey, do you want to share your location?
[01:22:49.960 --> 01:22:50.800]   Isn't that great?
[01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:51.640]   See?
[01:22:51.640 --> 01:22:52.480]   You can get--
[01:22:52.480 --> 01:22:53.320]   Yes.
[01:22:53.320 --> 01:22:55.080]   You'll get suggested responses, which are very good,
[01:22:55.080 --> 01:22:57.520]   because Google's watching you every step of the way.
[01:22:57.520 --> 01:22:59.320]   Who knows where you are.
[01:22:59.320 --> 01:23:00.160]   Three minutes.
[01:23:00.160 --> 01:23:01.000]   Three minutes.
[01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:02.160]   And you could put in the maps.
[01:23:02.160 --> 01:23:03.560]   Typing indicators.
[01:23:03.560 --> 01:23:06.840]   The features that have been in every other messenger platform
[01:23:06.840 --> 01:23:08.560]   forever, finally come up.
[01:23:08.560 --> 01:23:09.400]   Text messaging.
[01:23:09.400 --> 01:23:11.880]   So when somebody's typing, you'll see the dot, dot, dot,
[01:23:11.880 --> 01:23:13.080]   that they're working on a message.
[01:23:13.080 --> 01:23:13.920]   Things like that.
[01:23:13.920 --> 01:23:18.080]   Messaging over Wi-Fi, which is very nice.
[01:23:19.040 --> 01:23:21.160]   Here's another one you're going to like, Jeff.
[01:23:21.160 --> 01:23:23.880]   When you travel with Google Fi, they're
[01:23:23.880 --> 01:23:29.040]   upgrading the speed in 33 countries to 4G LTE.
[01:23:29.040 --> 01:23:30.240]   Jeff's happy.
[01:23:30.240 --> 01:23:32.720]   Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus,
[01:23:32.720 --> 01:23:35.000]   Denmark, most of Europe, basically.
[01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:38.720]   Europe and Kazakhstan and Israel.
[01:23:38.720 --> 01:23:39.560]   And Monaco.
[01:23:39.560 --> 01:23:40.000]   Kazakhstan.
[01:23:40.000 --> 01:23:41.000]   Kazakhstan.
[01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:41.600]   Is it in Europe?
[01:23:41.600 --> 01:23:43.080]   I guess it is.
[01:23:43.080 --> 01:23:44.920]   What is Europe these days?
[01:23:44.920 --> 01:23:45.520]   Who knows?
[01:23:45.520 --> 01:23:46.520]   Israel is not.
[01:23:46.520 --> 01:23:47.600]   So Israel is the only one.
[01:23:47.600 --> 01:23:48.640]   UK is not in Europe.
[01:23:48.640 --> 01:23:49.160]   Hong Kong.
[01:23:49.160 --> 01:23:49.720]   That's not the story.
[01:23:49.720 --> 01:23:50.440]   Hong Kong.
[01:23:50.440 --> 01:23:51.120]   Hong Kong.
[01:23:51.120 --> 01:23:52.360]   Kuwait is also not.
[01:23:52.360 --> 01:23:53.360]   Kuwait.
[01:23:53.360 --> 01:23:54.760]   So there you go.
[01:23:54.760 --> 01:23:59.040]   Lot Fialetho, Waini, and Luxembourg, the big L's.
[01:23:59.040 --> 01:24:00.240]   That's kind of nice.
[01:24:00.240 --> 01:24:05.440]   For people who travel, that will be a very nice addition to--
[01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:08.440]   I use Google Fi for that reason alone, really.
[01:24:08.440 --> 01:24:09.480]   Japan--
[01:24:09.480 --> 01:24:10.800]   It is my international phone.
[01:24:10.800 --> 01:24:11.120]   Yeah.
[01:24:11.120 --> 01:24:11.880]   Around abroad.
[01:24:11.880 --> 01:24:12.920]   I use it.
[01:24:12.920 --> 01:24:14.200]   And I'm tempted.
[01:24:14.200 --> 01:24:16.840]   I'm constantly tempted to go ahead and switch over.
[01:24:16.840 --> 01:24:19.120]   And I keep on wanting to just irritate AT&T
[01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:21.800]   by keeping my grandfather a limited plan.
[01:24:21.800 --> 01:24:22.360]   I know.
[01:24:22.360 --> 01:24:23.520]   Just to bug him.
[01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:24.320]   Just to take that.
[01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:25.560]   I'm sure they sit up there and say that--
[01:24:25.560 --> 01:24:26.560]   Jarvis!
[01:24:26.560 --> 01:24:28.520]   [SCREAMS]
[01:24:28.520 --> 01:24:32.680]   That's a lot of work, by the way, to keep that 2007
[01:24:32.680 --> 01:24:36.760]   unlimited data plan that you got way back when with the iPhone.
[01:24:36.760 --> 01:24:38.280]   That's a lot of way whole.
[01:24:38.280 --> 01:24:39.760]   Yeah, it is.
[01:24:39.760 --> 01:24:41.160]   I probably hurt myself.
[01:24:41.160 --> 01:24:42.400]   I probably spend more--
[01:24:42.400 --> 01:24:42.400]   Yeah.
[01:24:42.400 --> 01:24:43.360]   --get less.
[01:24:43.360 --> 01:24:45.760]   Most people have given that up a long time ago.
[01:24:45.760 --> 01:24:46.640]   Oh.
[01:24:46.640 --> 01:24:47.440]   Hello.
[01:24:47.440 --> 01:24:47.920]   Your court--
[01:24:47.920 --> 01:24:48.560]   Well, he's here.
[01:24:48.560 --> 01:24:51.480]   Jeff, he's shouting so loud.
[01:24:51.480 --> 01:24:53.320]   Or is the UPS guy there?
[01:24:53.320 --> 01:24:53.840]   Oh.
[01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:56.160]   It's my family coming home.
[01:24:56.160 --> 01:24:57.640]   Oh, good.
[01:24:57.640 --> 01:25:02.080]   Pick up where you left off on search.
[01:25:02.080 --> 01:25:05.400]   There will be new activity cards when you do Google
[01:25:05.400 --> 01:25:11.520]   that will show you previous searches so that you can pick up--
[01:25:11.520 --> 01:25:13.360]   it's your related activity.
[01:25:13.360 --> 01:25:15.680]   Only you can see these.
[01:25:15.680 --> 01:25:17.360]   So you can pick up where you left off.
[01:25:17.360 --> 01:25:17.880]   This is going to--
[01:25:17.880 --> 01:25:18.380]   Yeah.
[01:25:18.380 --> 01:25:22.960]   Well, that's why they say only you can see these.
[01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:24.480]   So if you search for eating clean,
[01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:26.320]   it will then pull up all the clean eating stuff
[01:25:26.320 --> 01:25:27.400]   that you did earlier.
[01:25:27.400 --> 01:25:29.480]   Links to pages you visited in the past,
[01:25:29.480 --> 01:25:32.240]   searches you've done, and then you can click back.
[01:25:32.240 --> 01:25:36.840]   That's nice because I often want to search research something.
[01:25:36.840 --> 01:25:39.000]   You know, like, oh, what was that?
[01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.440]   And so it'll be nice to get that in there.
[01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:44.720]   You can control-- there's a three-dot icon
[01:25:44.720 --> 01:25:46.200]   in the knowledge card.
[01:25:46.200 --> 01:25:48.800]   You can control what appears in your activity card
[01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:52.000]   by deleting an item, by pressing it or turning off cards,
[01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:55.280]   by tapping the three-dot icon.
[01:25:55.280 --> 01:25:58.200]   Rolled out today on the mobile web and the Google App
[01:25:58.200 --> 01:26:00.440]   in English in the US.
[01:26:00.440 --> 01:26:05.160]   And when I say today, I mean four days ago, five days ago,
[01:26:05.160 --> 01:26:05.960]   a long time ago.
[01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:12.800]   But since we've met last, the google.org fellowship--
[01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:14.400]   are you familiar with this?
[01:26:14.400 --> 01:26:15.280]   No, I'm not.
[01:26:15.280 --> 01:26:16.640]   I think I do.
[01:26:16.640 --> 01:26:17.680]   I think which one is this?
[01:26:17.680 --> 01:26:19.840]   They're doing a lot of these kinds of things.
[01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:20.640]   Yeah.
[01:26:20.640 --> 01:26:22.040]   It's a fellowship to--
[01:26:22.040 --> 01:26:30.960]   the next fellowship started today with Goodwill Industries.
[01:26:30.960 --> 01:26:33.720]   A team of seven Google.org fellows, including software
[01:26:33.720 --> 01:26:36.720]   engineers and data scientists, will work in community-based
[01:26:36.720 --> 01:26:39.200]   Goodwill organizations across the US.
[01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:42.120]   They're Google employees who do a fellowship helping--
[01:26:42.120 --> 01:26:44.160]   who go over and help nonprofits.
[01:26:44.160 --> 01:26:45.680]   Yeah.
[01:26:45.680 --> 01:26:48.000]   Just as folks help the government after the--
[01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:48.520]   Yeah.
[01:26:48.520 --> 01:26:49.120]   --the volunteer.
[01:26:49.120 --> 01:26:50.320]   Like, yeah, yeah, exactly.
[01:26:50.320 --> 01:26:53.320]   Like the-- what was it?
[01:26:53.320 --> 01:26:54.160]   It was not code for America.
[01:26:54.160 --> 01:26:54.960]   Digital service?
[01:26:54.960 --> 01:26:56.160]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:26:56.160 --> 01:26:56.840]   Digital service.
[01:26:56.840 --> 01:26:57.640]   Mad cuts.
[01:26:57.640 --> 01:26:58.000]   Mad cuts.
[01:26:58.000 --> 01:26:58.680]   For mad cuts.
[01:26:58.680 --> 01:27:01.920]   Acting, managing director.
[01:27:01.920 --> 01:27:04.000]   Jeff, did we ever give your Facebook disclosure?
[01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:05.640]   I just realized we argued a lot about it.
[01:27:05.640 --> 01:27:06.120]   Thank you.
[01:27:06.120 --> 01:27:06.620]   Thank you.
[01:27:06.620 --> 01:27:07.120]   Thank you.
[01:27:07.120 --> 01:27:07.620]   I forgot.
[01:27:07.620 --> 01:27:08.120]   Yes.
[01:27:08.120 --> 01:27:08.620]   Yes.
[01:27:08.620 --> 01:27:10.440]   So at the New Mark Graduate School of Journalism,
[01:27:10.440 --> 01:27:15.200]   I raised funds for the school from Facebook, as well as others.
[01:27:15.200 --> 01:27:16.640]   I am independent of Facebook.
[01:27:16.640 --> 01:27:19.000]   I received no money personally from Facebook or any platforms.
[01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:20.840]   Thank you, Stacy, for reminding me.
[01:27:20.840 --> 01:27:21.280]   No problem.
[01:27:21.280 --> 01:27:23.760]   I believe you that you are not--
[01:27:23.760 --> 01:27:25.920]   I believe that this is a deeply held passion.
[01:27:25.920 --> 01:27:26.420]   Yeah.
[01:27:26.420 --> 01:27:27.840]   I saw somebody in the chat room.
[01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:29.880]   When you want to disagree with somebody,
[01:27:29.880 --> 01:27:31.760]   who's paying Jarvis?
[01:27:31.760 --> 01:27:33.800]   I just want everybody to know if Mark Zuckerberg wants
[01:27:33.800 --> 01:27:35.040]   to write me a really big check.
[01:27:35.040 --> 01:27:37.400]   I'll say anything he wants.
[01:27:37.400 --> 01:27:39.200]   Well, I was in a session today.
[01:27:39.200 --> 01:27:41.640]   There was a couple organizations that just got some
[01:27:41.640 --> 01:27:43.880]   of the Facebook money, which may or may not talk about,
[01:27:43.880 --> 01:27:44.720]   for journalism.
[01:27:44.720 --> 01:27:45.680]   And I thought, good.
[01:27:45.680 --> 01:27:48.240]   I'm not the only one with cooties in the way.
[01:27:48.240 --> 01:27:48.760]   Hey.
[01:27:48.760 --> 01:27:51.360]   I just decided I've been in this business long enough now.
[01:27:51.360 --> 01:27:53.840]   I'm ready to sell out.
[01:27:53.840 --> 01:27:56.240]   I've held the line looking for a buyer.
[01:27:56.240 --> 01:27:57.200]   I'm ready.
[01:27:57.200 --> 01:27:58.520]   Well, I'm 62.
[01:27:58.520 --> 01:27:59.560]   I'm going to retire.
[01:27:59.560 --> 01:28:01.200]   I figure-- I always thought this.
[01:28:01.200 --> 01:28:02.960]   I thought, well, I'm going to have integrity right up
[01:28:02.960 --> 01:28:05.880]   to the very end, and then I'm just going to go crazy.
[01:28:05.880 --> 01:28:06.760]   Is it that--
[01:28:06.760 --> 01:28:09.200]   So is it like the weekly world news or the national
[01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:09.720]   inquirer?
[01:28:09.720 --> 01:28:12.840]   They would pay journalists incredible salaries,
[01:28:12.840 --> 01:28:15.840]   because basically you were ruined after you worked there?
[01:28:15.840 --> 01:28:16.440]   Yeah.
[01:28:16.440 --> 01:28:19.080]   There was a guy who left the Chicago Tribune when I was there
[01:28:19.080 --> 01:28:20.000]   many, many years ago.
[01:28:20.000 --> 01:28:21.800]   And it was secretive of where he was quitting.
[01:28:21.800 --> 01:28:23.200]   He was going, we didn't know where.
[01:28:23.200 --> 01:28:25.800]   And then we found out he went to the national inquirer.
[01:28:25.800 --> 01:28:27.360]   And we sat Shiva for him.
[01:28:27.360 --> 01:28:28.240]   Yeah, that's kind of--
[01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:29.720]   Because he's no other job.
[01:28:29.720 --> 01:28:32.160]   Although Sam Biddle managed to work for years at Gawker,
[01:28:32.160 --> 01:28:33.400]   sliming people like me.
[01:28:33.400 --> 01:28:35.400]   And now finds good work at the intercept.
[01:28:35.400 --> 01:28:38.800]   So it just shows there's a double standard in tech.
[01:28:38.800 --> 01:28:39.400]   No, I--
[01:28:39.400 --> 01:28:41.960]   This guy who went from the Tribune,
[01:28:41.960 --> 01:28:44.120]   to get into Bing Crosby's funeral,
[01:28:44.120 --> 01:28:45.320]   he dressed up as a priest.
[01:28:45.320 --> 01:28:47.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:28:47.760 --> 01:28:50.040]   It's-- it's cost play.
[01:28:50.040 --> 01:28:50.520]   He's in the--
[01:28:50.520 --> 01:28:51.240]   Where are my judges?
[01:28:51.240 --> 01:28:51.720]   --the New Yorkville--
[01:28:51.720 --> 01:28:53.120]   --the 30-point Avenue or whatever that was.
[01:28:53.120 --> 01:28:53.560]   Yeah.
[01:28:53.560 --> 01:28:55.080]   I'm doing Crosby cosplay.
[01:28:55.080 --> 01:28:55.840]   It's a tribute.
[01:28:55.840 --> 01:28:58.240]   It's an homage.
[01:28:58.240 --> 01:29:01.600]   No, I just figure--
[01:29:01.600 --> 01:29:02.120]   It's time for--
[01:29:02.120 --> 01:29:03.080]   Thank you for reminding me, Stacy.
[01:29:03.080 --> 01:29:04.160]   Time to get the big bucks.
[01:29:04.160 --> 01:29:05.280]   Yeah.
[01:29:05.280 --> 01:29:07.240]   Unfortunately.
[01:29:07.240 --> 01:29:08.240]   Nobody wants to buy a Leopold.
[01:29:08.240 --> 01:29:10.400]   Nobody wants to buy me.
[01:29:10.400 --> 01:29:13.560]   You're-- you're espoused with no devil.
[01:29:13.560 --> 01:29:15.320]   I'll give you my soul, please.
[01:29:15.320 --> 01:29:16.040]   Give me something.
[01:29:16.040 --> 01:29:17.040]   Hey, hey, hey, hey.
[01:29:17.040 --> 01:29:18.160]   If there are any Russians listening,
[01:29:18.160 --> 01:29:19.760]   and I'm sure there are, what's Leopold?
[01:29:19.760 --> 01:29:22.160]   I'm not-- that's the problem is I'm just not worth anything
[01:29:22.160 --> 01:29:23.680]   anymore, that's all.
[01:29:23.680 --> 01:29:24.480]   Here's some good news.
[01:29:24.480 --> 01:29:28.600]   Google Maps is starting to show speed trap warnings.
[01:29:28.600 --> 01:29:29.560]   Speed trap warnings.
[01:29:29.560 --> 01:29:32.160]   Oh, well, some people won't like that.
[01:29:32.160 --> 01:29:34.080]   Police won't like that at all.
[01:29:34.080 --> 01:29:35.080]   Oh.
[01:29:35.080 --> 01:29:39.200]   Speed cameras specifically rolling out to some users.
[01:29:39.200 --> 01:29:41.680]   The camera icons.
[01:29:41.680 --> 01:29:42.480]   See them?
[01:29:42.480 --> 01:29:44.680]   Little red camera icons.
[01:29:44.680 --> 01:29:45.160]   Yes.
[01:29:45.160 --> 01:29:47.880]   Appear long routes when planning your drive.
[01:29:47.880 --> 01:29:48.640]   So, well, let's see.
[01:29:48.640 --> 01:29:49.480]   I'd like to speed.
[01:29:49.480 --> 01:29:51.120]   So I'm going to turn right at Perry Commons
[01:29:51.120 --> 01:29:51.960]   and avoid that one.
[01:29:51.960 --> 01:29:52.480]   And then I'll--
[01:29:52.480 --> 01:29:54.080]   Is this in the UK?
[01:29:54.080 --> 01:29:55.040]   UK, yeah.
[01:29:55.040 --> 01:29:56.280]   Is this happening in the US?
[01:29:56.280 --> 01:29:59.160]   Where else does there something named Handsworth Wood?
[01:29:59.160 --> 01:30:00.360]   I mean, maybe this is like--
[01:30:00.360 --> 01:30:00.880]   Old Oscotts.
[01:30:00.880 --> 01:30:01.880]   --is it a little New England.
[01:30:01.880 --> 01:30:03.400]   I am just like--
[01:30:03.400 --> 01:30:09.880]   That's all drive to Handsworth Wood via Newton Road.
[01:30:09.880 --> 01:30:10.880]   Yeah, it's probably in the UK.
[01:30:10.880 --> 01:30:13.320]   It doesn't say this is an Android Central story,
[01:30:13.320 --> 01:30:14.280]   and it's a tipster.
[01:30:14.280 --> 01:30:18.200]   So probably this is--
[01:30:18.200 --> 01:30:20.120]   I mean, I'm all here for it.
[01:30:20.120 --> 01:30:22.520]   I'm just like, why is this real for me?
[01:30:22.520 --> 01:30:23.600]   Because I would totally use it.
[01:30:23.600 --> 01:30:24.480]   Is it illegal?
[01:30:24.480 --> 01:30:26.680]   I know it's illegal or in some jurisdictions
[01:30:26.680 --> 01:30:29.280]   to have a radar detector.
[01:30:29.280 --> 01:30:32.560]   New Jersey Outlaw and finally the speed camera--
[01:30:32.560 --> 01:30:35.440]   the red light cameras, which were dangerous as hell.
[01:30:35.440 --> 01:30:36.840]   Why was that?
[01:30:36.840 --> 01:30:40.840]   Because people would be hyper-causcious about it
[01:30:40.840 --> 01:30:43.200]   and stop when they normally would go.
[01:30:43.200 --> 01:30:47.880]   I mean, they wouldn't red lights anymore.
[01:30:47.880 --> 01:30:49.360]   That's dangerous?
[01:30:49.360 --> 01:30:50.840]   No, no, no.
[01:30:50.840 --> 01:30:52.600]   They would before the yellow, they would just--
[01:30:52.600 --> 01:30:54.760]   [GASPS]
[01:30:54.760 --> 01:30:56.520]   And then I got zapped once.
[01:30:56.520 --> 01:30:58.640]   The only time I ever got in ticket ever
[01:30:58.640 --> 01:30:59.760]   was when one of these damn things.
[01:30:59.760 --> 01:31:02.360]   And I called a lawyer and he said, it's not worth it, fella.
[01:31:02.360 --> 01:31:03.360]   It's 40 bucks.
[01:31:03.360 --> 01:31:04.360]   It's going to cost you a lot more.
[01:31:04.360 --> 01:31:05.080]   They got a picture.
[01:31:05.080 --> 01:31:06.960]   They don't really know you're in the car,
[01:31:06.960 --> 01:31:08.560]   so they're saying the car violated.
[01:31:08.560 --> 01:31:09.960]   In fact, the picture was proved.
[01:31:09.960 --> 01:31:11.040]   I was right.
[01:31:11.040 --> 01:31:11.560]   I was innocent.
[01:31:11.560 --> 01:31:12.880]   I was not--
[01:31:12.880 --> 01:31:14.360]   Oh, no, they were full proof.
[01:31:14.360 --> 01:31:16.640]   He said, I know you're right.
[01:31:16.640 --> 01:31:17.160]   Not worth it.
[01:31:17.160 --> 01:31:19.720]   Hey, man, they have a picture of you not running a red light?
[01:31:19.720 --> 01:31:20.720]   Yeah, so they said nothing to the thing.
[01:31:20.720 --> 01:31:22.800]   Yeah.
[01:31:22.800 --> 01:31:26.360]   OK, that's a good reason to get rid of them.
[01:31:26.360 --> 01:31:28.520]   I don't know if the reason that people are more cautious
[01:31:28.520 --> 01:31:30.760]   in their sections is a good reason.
[01:31:30.760 --> 01:31:32.480]   I think that's probably not a good reason.
[01:31:32.480 --> 01:31:34.200]   Well, no, because it was--
[01:31:34.200 --> 01:31:36.440]   this is Hudson County, New Jersey,
[01:31:36.440 --> 01:31:38.960]   where they have a different constitution that
[01:31:38.960 --> 01:31:41.000]   says people turning left have a right of way
[01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:44.480]   over all forms of life.
[01:31:44.480 --> 01:31:45.840]   They drive in a special way.
[01:31:45.840 --> 01:31:47.960]   Which is why you need red light camera.
[01:31:47.960 --> 01:31:51.560]   No, because it made them even crazier.
[01:31:51.560 --> 01:31:52.920]   You have two extremes.
[01:31:52.920 --> 01:31:55.080]   You have people who want to kill everything in their way
[01:31:55.080 --> 01:31:56.320]   of turning left.
[01:31:56.320 --> 01:31:58.960]   Then you have other people who ignore the law
[01:31:58.960 --> 01:32:03.720]   and decide they're going to stop and let someone turn or go.
[01:32:03.720 --> 01:32:04.960]   And they don't follow the law.
[01:32:04.960 --> 01:32:06.760]   So nobody knows what you're going to do.
[01:32:06.760 --> 01:32:08.520]   Just there's reason for rules.
[01:32:08.520 --> 01:32:09.760]   Just follow the rules.
[01:32:09.760 --> 01:32:11.320]   Follow the rules.
[01:32:11.320 --> 01:32:12.880]   Don't be extra nice.
[01:32:12.880 --> 01:32:14.760]   Follow the rules.
[01:32:14.760 --> 01:32:17.240]   Here is a sign that we are living in the future.
[01:32:17.240 --> 01:32:19.240]   The Play Store-- Google Play Store--
[01:32:19.240 --> 01:32:25.920]   is planning a phase out 32-bit apps by 2021.
[01:32:25.920 --> 01:32:26.880]   That's plenty of warning.
[01:32:26.880 --> 01:32:28.440]   20.
[01:32:28.440 --> 01:32:30.960]   Even the fact that we're even talking about 2021
[01:32:30.960 --> 01:32:32.560]   boggles my mind.
[01:32:32.560 --> 01:32:33.440]   Are we going to get there?
[01:32:33.440 --> 01:32:35.760]   I'm not sure these days.
[01:32:35.760 --> 01:32:39.320]   We'll have had another presidential election, in fact.
[01:32:39.320 --> 01:32:40.600]   Oh, my God.
[01:32:40.600 --> 01:32:42.320]   What could be quite a president warrant?
[01:32:42.320 --> 01:32:43.960]   We're not in charge.
[01:32:43.960 --> 01:32:45.680]   It'll be so exciting.
[01:32:45.680 --> 01:32:49.120]   I'm going to call our president Pocahontas.
[01:32:49.120 --> 01:32:51.240]   I think that is-- oh, did you want
[01:32:51.240 --> 01:32:55.240]   to talk about people getting money from Facebook?
[01:32:55.240 --> 01:32:57.560]   I don't see that story in here.
[01:32:57.560 --> 01:33:00.640]   No, well, Facebook were in the Google Change Law.
[01:33:00.640 --> 01:33:01.160]   Oh, OK.
[01:33:01.160 --> 01:33:01.520]   You're right.
[01:33:01.520 --> 01:33:02.000]   It's a Facebook--
[01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:02.480]   It's a Facebook--
[01:33:02.480 --> 01:33:03.000]   --and Google Change Law.
[01:33:03.000 --> 01:33:04.360]   --so let us--
[01:33:04.360 --> 01:33:07.880]   --with a flourish and the Google Change Law.
[01:33:07.880 --> 01:33:09.320]   Thank you very much.
[01:33:09.320 --> 01:33:10.920]   I feel like a flourish is trumpets,
[01:33:10.920 --> 01:33:12.480]   and that's more drum--
[01:33:12.480 --> 01:33:14.320]   Oh, no, I flourished my hand.
[01:33:14.320 --> 01:33:16.760]   Oh, I see.
[01:33:16.760 --> 01:33:18.280]   It was a hand flourish.
[01:33:18.280 --> 01:33:21.520]   Yeah, Leo knows no flourish, but his own.
[01:33:21.520 --> 01:33:26.240]   The most liked Instagram post of all time--
[01:33:26.240 --> 01:33:27.880]   I don't get this story at all.
[01:33:27.880 --> 01:33:29.960]   OK, you know what it really is?
[01:33:29.960 --> 01:33:35.280]   Is that people don't like Kylie Jenner.
[01:33:35.280 --> 01:33:40.320]   So a guy created an Instagram account, World Record Egg,
[01:33:40.320 --> 01:33:45.720]   with only one post, an egg, saying, let's set a world record
[01:33:45.720 --> 01:33:48.000]   together and get the most liked post on Instagram
[01:33:48.000 --> 01:33:52.080]   beating the current world record held by Kylie Jenner.
[01:33:52.080 --> 01:33:53.640]   She had 18 million likes.
[01:33:53.640 --> 01:34:01.840]   At last count, he has 46,348,847 likes for an egg.
[01:34:01.840 --> 01:34:04.040]   It's just like the video that Google did.
[01:34:04.040 --> 01:34:07.560]   Yeah, this is the new-- this is the new--
[01:34:07.560 --> 01:34:12.320]   Black in the internet is cast throwing shade.
[01:34:12.320 --> 01:34:15.200]   It's the new Screw You.
[01:34:15.200 --> 01:34:15.920]   I like it.
[01:34:15.920 --> 01:34:18.400]   The new Screw You.
[01:34:18.400 --> 01:34:22.280]   Oh, that's what we have this week in the new Screw You.
[01:34:22.280 --> 01:34:24.320]   OK, I want to do that show.
[01:34:24.320 --> 01:34:26.040]   That's a good show.
[01:34:26.040 --> 01:34:28.400]   This is when people made Hank the Angry
[01:34:28.400 --> 01:34:31.040]   Drunken Dwarf of Howard Stern Show the most--
[01:34:31.040 --> 01:34:33.160]   among people's most beautiful.
[01:34:33.160 --> 01:34:36.080]   This week in Twinsky.
[01:34:36.080 --> 01:34:37.160]   Or Twin Sea.
[01:34:37.160 --> 01:34:37.880]   Twin Sea.
[01:34:37.880 --> 01:34:41.240]   TWIN-C-W-I-N-S-C-Y.
[01:34:41.240 --> 01:34:43.520]   Twin-C.
[01:34:43.520 --> 01:34:49.240]   Oh, I was like T-W-E-D-L-R-D-L-I-T-C-C-I.
[01:34:49.240 --> 01:34:50.760]   Samsung has sent out invitations.
[01:34:50.760 --> 01:34:52.080]   I got one.
[01:34:52.080 --> 01:34:54.800]   I am not a pariah in the tech community.
[01:34:54.800 --> 01:34:56.920]   It's just Apple that hates me.
[01:34:56.920 --> 01:34:59.440]   They are going to have their big Samsung event in San
[01:34:59.440 --> 01:35:03.160]   Francisco in February 20th, a week before Mobile World
[01:35:03.160 --> 01:35:03.520]   Congress.
[01:35:03.520 --> 01:35:05.760]   They want to jump the gun of Mobile World Congress.
[01:35:05.760 --> 01:35:08.960]   It is thought they will announce the S10 and their new
[01:35:08.960 --> 01:35:11.760]   folding phone.
[01:35:11.760 --> 01:35:13.960]   So what do we think of folding phones?
[01:35:13.960 --> 01:35:15.160]   Well, I don't--
[01:35:15.160 --> 01:35:16.160]   I'm here for it, man.
[01:35:16.160 --> 01:35:16.880]   Are you?
[01:35:16.880 --> 01:35:21.320]   Because both Microsoft and Samsung are widely--
[01:35:21.320 --> 01:35:24.360]   well, Samsung has announced it, but Microsoft also has--
[01:35:24.360 --> 01:35:26.240]   there's evidence that it's going to do a folding thing of
[01:35:26.240 --> 01:35:26.960]   some kind of folding.
[01:35:26.960 --> 01:35:27.320]   I don't know.
[01:35:27.320 --> 01:35:30.120]   Well, it's adapting its OS for folding phones.
[01:35:30.120 --> 01:35:31.080]   Right.
[01:35:31.080 --> 01:35:36.080]   The latest insiders version had some code and playing.
[01:35:36.080 --> 01:35:38.000]   There would be a folding something.
[01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:39.800]   Not a phone, but something.
[01:35:39.800 --> 01:35:42.720]   I'm all about new interfaces, new ways to interact with it.
[01:35:42.720 --> 01:35:45.600]   I mean, maybe it'll be a bust, but I'd like to see it.
[01:35:45.600 --> 01:35:46.600]   I'd like to try it.
[01:35:46.600 --> 01:35:49.880]   I think there are lots of useful ways to use it.
[01:35:49.880 --> 01:35:50.320]   How about this?
[01:35:50.320 --> 01:35:52.640]   And if not for a phone, then maybe something else.
[01:35:52.640 --> 01:35:53.000]   OK.
[01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:57.280]   How about this week in dumb lawyer letters?
[01:35:57.280 --> 01:36:00.240]   Bird Scooter decided they didn't like boing boing.
[01:36:00.240 --> 01:36:05.640]   Last month, Corey Doctorow writes,
[01:36:05.640 --> 01:36:07.120]   don't screw with Corey Doctorow.
[01:36:07.120 --> 01:36:07.840]   OK, I'm just saying.
[01:36:07.840 --> 01:36:08.400]   Yeah, you do not.
[01:36:08.400 --> 01:36:09.560]   This is dumb.
[01:36:09.560 --> 01:36:12.200]   There should be a course in law school that says,
[01:36:12.200 --> 01:36:13.800]   don't screw with Corey Doctorow.
[01:36:13.800 --> 01:36:17.840]   Last month, he published a post discussing the fact that
[01:36:17.840 --> 01:36:21.880]   there were mountains of abandoned scooters piling up
[01:36:21.880 --> 01:36:23.680]   in city impound lots.
[01:36:23.680 --> 01:36:26.840]   And the rise of cheap Chinese conversion kits
[01:36:26.840 --> 01:36:30.240]   that lets you buy one of these scooters, swap out the motherboard
[01:36:30.240 --> 01:36:34.160]   and make it your own without any bird stuff on it.
[01:36:34.160 --> 01:36:38.920]   Bird sent him a cease and desist letter saying,
[01:36:38.920 --> 01:36:41.520]   that's a violation of section 12 of one of the Digital
[01:36:41.520 --> 01:36:43.880]   William Copyright Act, which prohibits
[01:36:43.880 --> 01:36:47.280]   the dissemination of circumvention tools.
[01:36:47.280 --> 01:36:49.080]   Maybe they didn't know that Corey Doctorow
[01:36:49.080 --> 01:36:52.880]   is one of the leading campaigners against section 1201
[01:36:52.880 --> 01:36:56.240]   in the world and has some friends over there
[01:36:56.240 --> 01:37:00.160]   at the Electronic Frontier Foundation.
[01:37:00.160 --> 01:37:02.560]   In response, Corey writes, Bird sent us a legal threat
[01:37:02.560 --> 01:37:03.520]   of such absurdity.
[01:37:03.520 --> 01:37:06.760]   We're publishing it in full along with a scorching response
[01:37:06.760 --> 01:37:09.680]   from the EFF as a kind of celebration of truly world
[01:37:09.680 --> 01:37:13.480]   class legal foolishness.
[01:37:13.480 --> 01:37:15.040]   It's not a circumvention device,
[01:37:15.040 --> 01:37:17.240]   a because you're replacing the board.
[01:37:17.240 --> 01:37:19.600]   You're not in any way hacking it.
[01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:23.440]   B, he's a journalist and he's writing about people doing it,
[01:37:23.440 --> 01:37:25.400]   not telling you how to do it.
[01:37:25.400 --> 01:37:28.960]   And he's protected by something we call the US Constitution.
[01:37:28.960 --> 01:37:34.560]   And C, you're actually sending a cease and desist letter to a guy
[01:37:34.560 --> 01:37:39.440]   who says, I've pledged myself to killing section 1201.
[01:37:39.440 --> 01:37:43.240]   Literally his new project, Apollo 1201.
[01:37:44.520 --> 01:37:46.480]   This is his life goal.
[01:37:46.480 --> 01:37:47.960]   You couldn't set it to.
[01:37:47.960 --> 01:37:49.920]   Well, maybe it's a better person.
[01:37:49.920 --> 01:37:53.520]   A perfect example of what's wrong with 1201.
[01:37:53.520 --> 01:37:55.680]   How old was 1201?
[01:37:55.680 --> 01:37:56.520]   What was it past?
[01:37:56.520 --> 01:37:58.840]   1998.
[01:37:58.840 --> 01:37:59.680]   I did.
[01:37:59.680 --> 01:38:00.760]   With the DMCA.
[01:38:00.760 --> 01:38:06.440]   And it basically meant people couldn't bypass copy protection.
[01:38:06.440 --> 01:38:07.280]   Right.
[01:38:07.280 --> 01:38:08.120]   You couldn't do any research.
[01:38:08.120 --> 01:38:09.080]   You couldn't do any analysis.
[01:38:09.080 --> 01:38:10.320]   You couldn't disseminate.
[01:38:10.320 --> 01:38:12.680]   And so it's a pretty broad,
[01:38:12.680 --> 01:38:14.800]   it's a pretty big stretch to say that he was helping people
[01:38:14.800 --> 01:38:16.960]   bypass copy protection at all.
[01:38:16.960 --> 01:38:23.160]   One side effect you might have noticed of the government shutdown,
[01:38:23.160 --> 01:38:26.720]   but side effect that President Trump's going to have to apparently
[01:38:26.720 --> 01:38:28.680]   mail in his State of the Union address.
[01:38:28.680 --> 01:38:33.560]   It was suggested that he could do it on the Google Doc.
[01:38:33.560 --> 01:38:35.720]   Make it go, go, go, go, go, tweet it.
[01:38:35.720 --> 01:38:37.600]   No, no, no, that's not modern enough.
[01:38:37.600 --> 01:38:38.720]   Tweet it.
[01:38:38.720 --> 01:38:39.840]   Tweet it.
[01:38:39.840 --> 01:38:41.600]   Instagram story and stuff.
[01:38:41.600 --> 01:38:47.160]   He should buy hamburgers for everybody in Congress and tweet it.
[01:38:47.160 --> 01:38:54.040]   The government, many of the government agencies that are shut down
[01:38:54.040 --> 01:38:58.200]   have websites whose certificates have expired.
[01:38:58.200 --> 01:39:02.080]   And as a result, either you can't go into the site or worse.
[01:39:02.080 --> 01:39:04.440]   You can go in the site in securely, including this, by the way,
[01:39:04.440 --> 01:39:06.040]   is the Department of Justice.
[01:39:06.040 --> 01:39:09.280]   Most of these are government agencies that didn't renew their own.
[01:39:09.280 --> 01:39:10.800]   Well, there's no one there to renew them.
[01:39:11.160 --> 01:39:12.160]   Right.
[01:39:12.160 --> 01:39:15.680]   Now, Steve gives a point out that next time there's going to be a shutdown,
[01:39:15.680 --> 01:39:18.200]   they could proactively renew them before the shutdown.
[01:39:18.200 --> 01:39:22.040]   Maybe or say you're not paying me to heck with it.
[01:39:22.040 --> 01:39:23.240]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:39:23.240 --> 01:39:24.760]   Get somebody else to do it.
[01:39:24.760 --> 01:39:27.320]   NASA, the Department of Justice Court of Appeals.
[01:39:27.320 --> 01:39:32.680]   But it's important to note that if you in some of these sites,
[01:39:32.680 --> 01:39:34.800]   they correctly shut them down.
[01:39:34.800 --> 01:39:38.440]   But in some of the sites, you can go in just in securely.
[01:39:38.440 --> 01:39:42.520]   Maybe it would be just a little reminder, a little public service warning.
[01:39:42.520 --> 01:39:45.640]   You probably shouldn't because at that point, you're insecure.
[01:39:45.640 --> 01:39:47.240]   And any.
[01:39:47.240 --> 01:39:47.720]   Oh, man.
[01:39:47.720 --> 01:39:49.560]   So I just went to NASA to see if it was up.
[01:39:49.560 --> 01:39:51.560]   It is indeed a big red box.
[01:39:51.560 --> 01:39:55.200]   If you're a currently a NASA employee affected by the furlough, click here.
[01:39:55.200 --> 01:39:57.640]   Huh.
[01:39:57.640 --> 01:39:59.360]   What are they going to do?
[01:39:59.360 --> 01:40:00.000]   To ensure.
[01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:01.000]   Oh, wait a minute, wait a second.
[01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:04.840]   To ensure you're reviewing the latest version of this website,
[01:40:04.840 --> 01:40:07.960]   please clear your browser's cache by doing the following blah, blah, blah, blah.
[01:40:08.200 --> 01:40:08.720]   Huh.
[01:40:08.720 --> 01:40:10.280]   Use of government.
[01:40:10.280 --> 01:40:11.680]   I don't want to wonder what this is.
[01:40:11.680 --> 01:40:13.400]   Is this because of the certificate?
[01:40:13.400 --> 01:40:14.520]   Who knows?
[01:40:14.520 --> 01:40:16.680]   No, it looks like it's HTTPS.
[01:40:16.680 --> 01:40:18.920]   They must have renewed theirs because that looks like it's OK.
[01:40:18.920 --> 01:40:20.600]   I don't see.
[01:40:20.600 --> 01:40:21.800]   They're rocket scientists.
[01:40:21.800 --> 01:40:23.600]   They're rocket scientists.
[01:40:23.600 --> 01:40:29.600]   Yeah, I would figure somebody go in on his day off and just say, Hey, yeah, let me renew that.
[01:40:29.600 --> 01:40:31.960]   Oh, but look at that.
[01:40:31.960 --> 01:40:32.880]   I mean, this is fast.
[01:40:32.880 --> 01:40:34.440]   This is this is this is the.
[01:40:34.440 --> 01:40:37.240]   So FAQ for password exploration.
[01:40:37.520 --> 01:40:39.440]   FAQ for expiring badges.
[01:40:39.440 --> 01:40:42.800]   Oh, credit union and bank assistance during the shutdown.
[01:40:42.800 --> 01:40:45.400]   Important government travel card information.
[01:40:45.400 --> 01:40:46.720]   This just breaks my heart.
[01:40:46.720 --> 01:40:50.600]   Oh, my Lord, seeking outside employment during a shutdown.
[01:40:50.600 --> 01:40:55.120]   This is this is just yeah, you're right.
[01:40:55.120 --> 01:40:56.040]   It's heartbreaking.
[01:40:56.040 --> 01:40:57.040]   Really is.
[01:40:57.040 --> 01:41:01.280]   Oh, FAQs on retirement during the current shutdown.
[01:41:01.280 --> 01:41:03.280]   Man, oh, man.
[01:41:05.280 --> 01:41:07.080]   How do requests and activity be accepted?
[01:41:07.080 --> 01:41:09.040]   Because these are scientists who want to do their work.
[01:41:09.040 --> 01:41:10.200]   Right.
[01:41:10.200 --> 01:41:17.960]   Well, as long as we're going to piss off the trumpeters, let's talk about ROKU banning first approving and then banning Infowars.
[01:41:17.960 --> 01:41:23.200]   Yes, I didn't do this story yesterday because I was a mistake.
[01:41:23.200 --> 01:41:23.480]   Yeah.
[01:41:23.480 --> 01:41:28.160]   Well, yesterday, ROKU added an Infowars channel to its channel guide.
[01:41:28.160 --> 01:41:31.600]   And I didn't do the story because I had a feeling that was not the end of it.
[01:41:31.600 --> 01:41:34.320]   And literally hours later.
[01:41:35.320 --> 01:41:39.160]   They said they tweeted after the Infowars channel became available.
[01:41:39.160 --> 01:41:44.200]   We heard from concerned parties and determined the channel should be removed from our platform.
[01:41:44.200 --> 01:41:48.360]   The concerned parties, by the way, included parents of Sandy Hook students who had been murdered.
[01:41:48.360 --> 01:41:53.960]   Of course, as you know, Alex Jones says that no one was ever murdered at Sandy Hook.
[01:41:53.960 --> 01:41:59.760]   Deletion from the channel store and platform has begun, says ROKU and will be completed shortly.
[01:41:59.760 --> 01:42:01.520]   This is of course.
[01:42:01.520 --> 01:42:02.800]   I don't think he could really believe that.
[01:42:02.800 --> 01:42:04.600]   Do you think he really believes that?
[01:42:04.600 --> 01:42:15.200]   You know, I always wondered this about some of these demagogues is how much of it is good business and how much of it is pure belief.
[01:42:15.200 --> 01:42:17.520]   He's a, I mean, he's a bit better.
[01:42:17.520 --> 01:42:18.960]   He actually believed it.
[01:42:18.960 --> 01:42:22.160]   He himself in his divorce decree said he's just an entertainer.
[01:42:22.160 --> 01:42:26.080]   Yeah, which I mean, because that's it's pretty
[01:42:26.080 --> 01:42:32.320]   reprehensible to lie about something that's so harmful to people.
[01:42:32.320 --> 01:42:34.320]   Yeah, I don't know.
[01:42:34.320 --> 01:42:41.000]   He said that in fact, actually last week, the parents of the children who were murdered at Sandy Hook, one illegal victory against him.
[01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:50.600]   A judge ruled that the families of victims must be granted access to financial records and other documents in part of the discovery process in an ongoing lawsuit against info wars.
[01:42:50.600 --> 01:42:51.880]   That should be good reading.
[01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:57.480]   So could we sue about Trump's repeated statements about crowds at his inauguration?
[01:42:57.480 --> 01:43:00.240]   There's no document.
[01:43:00.240 --> 01:43:02.520]   I'm mad about the Fazen hamburgers.
[01:43:02.520 --> 01:43:04.200]   I don't work.
[01:43:04.200 --> 01:43:06.320]   There were only 300 hamburgers.
[01:43:06.320 --> 01:43:09.920]   That picture was the most amazing.
[01:43:09.920 --> 01:43:16.280]   By the way, the next day, members of Congress came to the White House and had steak.
[01:43:16.280 --> 01:43:17.960]   Yeah.
[01:43:17.960 --> 01:43:20.680]   By the way, what's worse than a cold big Mac?
[01:43:20.680 --> 01:43:21.360]   Oh, God.
[01:43:21.360 --> 01:43:23.040]   Nothing. In fact, we wouldn't even sell them.
[01:43:23.040 --> 01:43:24.160]   I used to work at McDonald's.
[01:43:24.160 --> 01:43:25.120]   There's a little.
[01:43:25.120 --> 01:43:40.800]   So now, nowadays they have electronics, but my day, when you put a rack of big Macs up in there, you put a card on it that said that the minute that it was made in five minutes after that, you throw them out because there's nothing worse.
[01:43:40.800 --> 01:43:42.200]   And I've had them.
[01:43:42.200 --> 01:43:43.240]   They're horrible.
[01:43:43.240 --> 01:43:46.480]   They can now they're all made right in time, right?
[01:43:46.480 --> 01:43:48.680]   You want them fresh.
[01:43:48.680 --> 01:43:49.680]   They're bad.
[01:43:49.680 --> 01:43:51.120]   I mean, it was your job at McDonald's.
[01:43:51.120 --> 01:43:52.200]   We got over this.
[01:43:52.200 --> 01:43:53.320]   What was your job at McDonald's?
[01:43:53.320 --> 01:43:54.680]   I was in it was my first job.
[01:43:54.680 --> 01:43:55.320]   I was in high school.
[01:43:55.320 --> 01:43:56.040]   I was 16.
[01:43:56.040 --> 01:44:09.760]   I started as everyone does at McDonald's selling the orange aid at the counter and grab a bucket and mop was that I learned how to work there. They said, if you're standing still wipe down the counter, you know, you're always doing something.
[01:44:09.760 --> 01:44:12.040]   And you learned customer service was great.
[01:44:12.040 --> 01:44:14.880]   And then I worked my way up to shake the shake machine.
[01:44:14.880 --> 01:44:20.720]   And then from the shake machine to the fry machine, that's a challenge because there's hot oil there.
[01:44:21.400 --> 01:44:22.160]   You could hurt yourself.
[01:44:22.160 --> 01:44:22.960]   You could hurt yourself.
[01:44:22.960 --> 01:44:25.680]   And then I was very proud by the end.
[01:44:25.680 --> 01:44:32.920]   I worked my way up to the grill and I was closer, which meant that you had to stay till like midnight till McDonald's is closed.
[01:44:32.920 --> 01:44:34.880]   And then you have to clean everything.
[01:44:34.880 --> 01:44:41.040]   Oh, I remember from my ponderosa days, the stainless steel polish you had to do.
[01:44:41.040 --> 01:44:41.800]   We yeah.
[01:44:41.800 --> 01:44:42.200]   Yeah.
[01:44:42.200 --> 01:44:46.000]   And then on the grill, maybe many people don't know this, but here's a little handy tip.
[01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:50.440]   The old pickle juice is great for breaking down the grease on the grill.
[01:44:50.440 --> 01:44:53.080]   Ah, ah, that was a problem process.
[01:44:53.080 --> 01:44:54.240]   I think that was in the manual.
[01:44:54.240 --> 01:44:55.240]   Yeah.
[01:44:55.240 --> 01:44:57.000]   Well, it's just vinegar.
[01:44:57.000 --> 01:44:58.080]   Yeah, it's great.
[01:44:58.080 --> 01:44:59.400]   It's just slightly acidic.
[01:44:59.400 --> 01:45:00.880]   Oh, science, Stacy.
[01:45:00.880 --> 01:45:02.000]   Oh, sorry.
[01:45:02.000 --> 01:45:06.400]   It's like it's like people like the Taco Bell sauce that will eat the rust off your pennies.
[01:45:06.400 --> 01:45:07.240]   Like we'll.
[01:45:07.240 --> 01:45:08.800]   Yeah, it's it's a light acid.
[01:45:08.800 --> 01:45:11.720]   Don't drink a Coke.
[01:45:11.720 --> 01:45:15.640]   I was the kitchen manager at ponderosa.
[01:45:15.640 --> 01:45:17.560]   Oh, I'm going to say,
[01:45:17.560 --> 01:45:19.960]   the kind of roasted steakhouse, what were you?
[01:45:19.960 --> 01:45:20.800]   What I had.
[01:45:20.800 --> 01:45:22.080]   Well, kitchen manager was made up.
[01:45:22.080 --> 01:45:23.360]   I was in charge of the bus boys.
[01:45:23.360 --> 01:45:27.000]   And clearly that table is clear that table.
[01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:27.480]   I was.
[01:45:27.480 --> 01:45:30.280]   I was a clerk at Randall's or a checker.
[01:45:30.280 --> 01:45:32.240]   Oh, it's grandals.
[01:45:32.240 --> 01:45:37.800]   Say is a grocery store that was bought by Albertsons or Safeway or something.
[01:45:37.800 --> 01:45:39.840]   I hope those jobs exist still.
[01:45:39.840 --> 01:45:43.800]   I mean, I really worry about young kids because are there still good?
[01:45:43.800 --> 01:45:44.360]   Good.
[01:45:44.360 --> 01:45:46.280]   I mean, are they still entry level jobs out there?
[01:45:46.280 --> 01:45:48.480]   We're like, oh, we can't find them.
[01:45:48.480 --> 01:45:49.400]   They can't find it.
[01:45:49.400 --> 01:45:50.400]   Teenagers don't want to.
[01:45:50.400 --> 01:45:51.320]   They don't want to do that.
[01:45:51.320 --> 01:45:52.520]   I'm going to be a web designer.
[01:45:52.520 --> 01:45:53.680]   Old people are going to see.
[01:45:53.680 --> 01:45:54.840]   So old people.
[01:45:54.840 --> 01:45:57.080]   So like, I mean, I have lots.
[01:45:57.080 --> 01:45:59.440]   I mean, you can get paid more like our babysitters.
[01:45:59.440 --> 01:46:03.000]   We pay them like 15 or sometimes one dollars an hour.
[01:46:03.000 --> 01:46:05.200]   Come home smelling like hamburgers when you can smell like.
[01:46:05.200 --> 01:46:08.320]   And then there's lots of like cake.
[01:46:08.320 --> 01:46:12.240]   A lot of very entrepreneurial kids will do things like, Hey, I'll teach
[01:46:12.240 --> 01:46:15.640]   parents Fortnite or I'll rent myself out to code.
[01:46:15.640 --> 01:46:17.360]   Kids and that's a job.
[01:46:17.360 --> 01:46:21.640]   That's a job that people in my neighborhood do teaching parents people
[01:46:21.640 --> 01:46:22.840]   are so low could do.
[01:46:22.840 --> 01:46:24.480]   Yeah.
[01:46:24.480 --> 01:46:27.600]   What and and Carson, he sounds like you've taken lessons.
[01:46:27.600 --> 01:46:28.080]   Why?
[01:46:28.080 --> 01:46:29.400]   Why would you?
[01:46:29.400 --> 01:46:34.400]   I learned there's two there's two things you can rent yourself out as.
[01:46:34.400 --> 01:46:38.040]   You can rent yourself out as to train younger children to play.
[01:46:38.040 --> 01:46:39.200]   Yes, for tonight.
[01:46:39.200 --> 01:46:43.920]   Oh, or parents who are worried about what their children are doing
[01:46:43.920 --> 01:46:45.280]   and want to understand.
[01:46:45.280 --> 01:46:50.120]   And be and play with them so they can so they can hear the chatter going on.
[01:46:50.120 --> 01:46:51.160]   Oh, that's a good idea.
[01:46:51.160 --> 01:46:53.360]   So you're educating the the old.
[01:46:53.360 --> 01:46:54.960]   Are you moonlighting Carson?
[01:46:54.960 --> 01:46:58.400]   No, I'm I'm Zach doesn't let you play in his squad, does he?
[01:46:58.400 --> 01:47:01.680]   Sometimes I play with him.
[01:47:01.680 --> 01:47:02.480]   Sometimes I don't.
[01:47:02.480 --> 01:47:03.640]   I usually I don't.
[01:47:03.640 --> 01:47:07.440]   See, so these are legit.
[01:47:07.440 --> 01:47:08.920]   Who is who is the Fortnite?
[01:47:08.920 --> 01:47:09.640]   Or your house?
[01:47:09.640 --> 01:47:10.600]   Is it the younger?
[01:47:10.600 --> 01:47:12.280]   It's the it's the 14 year old.
[01:47:12.280 --> 01:47:13.120]   It's Alex.
[01:47:13.120 --> 01:47:14.440]   No, it's that's Zach.
[01:47:14.440 --> 01:47:15.400]   Alex is 11.
[01:47:15.400 --> 01:47:17.400]   He's oh, I got to get used to mine.
[01:47:17.400 --> 01:47:20.120]   I am a mine crafter.
[01:47:20.120 --> 01:47:22.480]   I love Minecraft.
[01:47:22.480 --> 01:47:23.680]   I can't stop playing.
[01:47:23.680 --> 01:47:24.520]   It's a great game.
[01:47:24.520 --> 01:47:25.720]   I come back to it all the time.
[01:47:25.720 --> 01:47:27.800]   Wonderful game.
[01:47:27.800 --> 01:47:29.000]   I play with Alex.
[01:47:29.000 --> 01:47:34.320]   Yeah, you could build Michael, our 16 year old and his other 16 year old friends
[01:47:34.320 --> 01:47:41.480]   have asked me to start a flat world on the server for them so they can build a replica of Petaluma.
[01:47:41.480 --> 01:47:43.800]   That's awesome.
[01:47:43.800 --> 01:47:44.840]   Isn't that amazing?
[01:47:44.840 --> 01:47:47.400]   And by the way, they had the skills to do it.
[01:47:47.400 --> 01:47:48.600]   You should see what they build.
[01:47:48.600 --> 01:47:50.360]   It's amazing.
[01:47:50.360 --> 01:47:56.200]   So I'm giving you my 15 minute warning.
[01:47:56.200 --> 01:48:00.760]   Well, I'm giving you my last out of the day and you're going to give me
[01:48:00.760 --> 01:48:03.880]   the pick of the week.
[01:48:03.880 --> 01:48:07.320]   But first, a word from WordPress.
[01:48:07.320 --> 01:48:10.840]   WordPress love WordPress.
[01:48:10.840 --> 01:48:12.280]   We were just talking about WordPress.
[01:48:13.160 --> 01:48:15.160]   Matt Mullenweg started the company.
[01:48:15.160 --> 01:48:17.880]   I'm an a WordPress.com user since 2012.
[01:48:17.880 --> 01:48:22.520]   I actually started even before then with a self install WordPress on my own server.
[01:48:22.520 --> 01:48:24.360]   What I found was what many people find.
[01:48:24.360 --> 01:48:27.240]   You spend more time, Andy and not go just saying this.
[01:48:27.240 --> 01:48:29.560]   He's running WordPress on his own server.
[01:48:29.560 --> 01:48:35.400]   We're getting the database right and fixing mess ups than posting content.
[01:48:35.400 --> 01:48:38.920]   That's when I realized, wait a minute, I could be doing this at WordPress.com.
[01:48:38.920 --> 01:48:41.720]   Let them do all the technical stuff.
[01:48:41.720 --> 01:48:42.680]   Let them do the serving.
[01:48:42.680 --> 01:48:46.600]   It actually costs less than me buying my own server and doing all the work.
[01:48:46.600 --> 01:48:48.360]   Hey, I learned it, which is great.
[01:48:48.360 --> 01:48:55.880]   But if you don't want to become an HTML CSS database guru, WordPress.com creates a stunning website.
[01:48:55.880 --> 01:48:58.120]   Very important that you own.
[01:48:58.120 --> 01:48:59.640]   It's your site.
[01:48:59.640 --> 01:49:01.400]   It's your content.
[01:49:01.400 --> 01:49:02.600]   It's nobody else's.
[01:49:02.600 --> 01:49:06.360]   If you're a business and you don't have a website, WordPress.com.
[01:49:06.360 --> 01:49:15.800]   If you're a teenager, don't let your other friends and their posts on social media sites become
[01:49:15.800 --> 01:49:18.520]   your person on the web.
[01:49:18.520 --> 01:49:19.880]   There's search results.
[01:49:19.880 --> 01:49:24.200]   When you search for your name, if you get crappy videos, your friends posting on Facebook,
[01:49:24.200 --> 01:49:25.320]   it's time to start a website.
[01:49:25.320 --> 01:49:29.960]   I tell every teenager, WordPress.com, there's a free tier.
[01:49:29.960 --> 01:49:30.520]   You can go there.
[01:49:30.520 --> 01:49:31.400]   It's free to start.
[01:49:31.400 --> 01:49:34.200]   You could try it, set up your site.
[01:49:34.200 --> 01:49:38.520]   That way, when people search for your name, they'll find your stuff, their best stuff.
[01:49:38.520 --> 01:49:39.400]   You're never stuck.
[01:49:39.400 --> 01:49:41.240]   You can upload video, audio.
[01:49:41.240 --> 01:49:42.520]   You don't have to put it on YouTube.
[01:49:42.520 --> 01:49:43.560]   You upload video.
[01:49:43.560 --> 01:49:44.280]   You upload audio.
[01:49:44.280 --> 01:49:45.000]   You upload pictures.
[01:49:45.000 --> 01:49:46.120]   You don't have to put them on Instagram.
[01:49:46.120 --> 01:49:46.920]   You can upload text.
[01:49:46.920 --> 01:49:48.040]   It's great for writing.
[01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:50.280]   Publish your ideas.
[01:49:50.280 --> 01:49:53.000]   And anytime you want it back, it's all yours.
[01:49:53.000 --> 01:49:53.880]   It's all your content.
[01:49:53.880 --> 01:49:54.680]   You can download it all.
[01:49:54.680 --> 01:49:55.720]   You can move it anywhere you want.
[01:49:55.720 --> 01:49:57.160]   It's your never locked in.
[01:49:57.160 --> 01:50:01.800]   WordPress.com is built to grow with you too to get where you want to be tomorrow.
[01:50:02.760 --> 01:50:06.440]   And if you ever have any questions, I love the customer support team.
[01:50:06.440 --> 01:50:10.760]   They're there 24 hours a day, including weekends, to answer any questions you have.
[01:50:10.760 --> 01:50:13.080]   It's such a powerful and flexible site.
[01:50:13.080 --> 01:50:16.600]   As we just heard, everybody uses WordPress.
[01:50:16.600 --> 01:50:17.640]   Quartz uses WordPress.
[01:50:17.640 --> 01:50:18.920]   Fortune uses WordPress.
[01:50:18.920 --> 01:50:22.520]   It's perfect for big companies and small.
[01:50:22.520 --> 01:50:25.560]   So many people use WordPress these days.
[01:50:25.560 --> 01:50:30.280]   That it powers 33% of the internet, one-third of all the internet,
[01:50:31.160 --> 01:50:35.480]   one-third of all the internet runs on WordPress.
[01:50:35.480 --> 01:50:36.120]   So should you.
[01:50:36.120 --> 01:50:40.760]   By the way, there's an advantage to that, because it means there's real support out there for WordPress.
[01:50:40.760 --> 01:50:43.400]   Not just from WordPress.com, but from third parties.
[01:50:43.400 --> 01:50:47.640]   Although I have to say the WordPress app is everything I could ever want on iPhone and Android.
[01:50:47.640 --> 01:50:49.480]   That's how I posted when I was on my trip.
[01:50:49.480 --> 01:50:51.240]   Go to WordPress.com/twig.
[01:50:51.240 --> 01:50:54.440]   You'll get 15% off any new plant purchase right now.
[01:50:54.440 --> 01:50:56.200]   Yep.
[01:50:56.200 --> 01:50:58.040]   WordPress.com/twig.
[01:50:58.040 --> 01:51:00.760]   15% off when you start that new site.
[01:51:01.240 --> 01:51:02.040]   Don't put it off.
[01:51:02.040 --> 01:51:05.400]   And honestly, it could be a site about your Minecraft builds.
[01:51:05.400 --> 01:51:07.960]   It could be a site about your plumbing business.
[01:51:07.960 --> 01:51:09.000]   It could be anything you want.
[01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:10.840]   That's the beauty of the open web.
[01:51:10.840 --> 01:51:13.080]   And that's what WordPress is all about.
[01:51:13.080 --> 01:51:15.880]   WordPress.com/twig.
[01:51:15.880 --> 01:51:19.240]   Stacey's stomach.
[01:51:19.240 --> 01:51:23.160]   We have that little monitor on her is 30% empty.
[01:51:23.160 --> 01:51:29.160]   Oh, actually right now it's probably closer to 60% empty, I guess.
[01:51:29.720 --> 01:51:33.000]   So we better get her out of here with her pick of the week.
[01:51:33.000 --> 01:51:34.440]   Excellent.
[01:51:34.440 --> 01:51:35.880]   So I talked about this.
[01:51:35.880 --> 01:51:38.920]   I think Leo, you made fun of this and I...
[01:51:38.920 --> 01:51:42.280]   How come I am getting beat up for making fun of stuff today?
[01:51:42.280 --> 01:51:43.560]   Well, you did.
[01:51:43.560 --> 01:51:44.520]   You made fun of it.
[01:51:44.520 --> 01:51:52.200]   So I saw this at CES and I looked into it and I am going to buy it because I think it's that amazing.
[01:51:52.200 --> 01:51:53.720]   It is called the Jacks Jocks.
[01:51:53.720 --> 01:51:57.800]   And this is because I spent so I left weights.
[01:51:57.800 --> 01:52:01.000]   And I've done kettlebells for a while.
[01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:04.760]   I'm not currently a kettlebell person, user, whatever.
[01:52:04.760 --> 01:52:07.320]   But this is $349.
[01:52:07.320 --> 01:52:11.640]   It's an internet or rather Bluetooth connected kettlebell set.
[01:52:11.640 --> 01:52:15.960]   So it's one kettlebell and you stick it on the base and then you add more weights to it.
[01:52:15.960 --> 01:52:18.520]   It's kind of like the both-flex idea that both-flex...
[01:52:18.520 --> 01:52:21.560]   It's an adjustable kit.
[01:52:21.560 --> 01:52:25.480]   The only thing I made fun of was that the whole point of the kettlebell,
[01:52:25.480 --> 01:52:29.160]   they were used... I think they were invented in Russia is it's the cheapest gear you can get.
[01:52:29.160 --> 01:52:31.560]   It's just a peak of iron with a handle on it.
[01:52:31.560 --> 01:52:33.000]   So that is not true.
[01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:35.160]   And this is where I wanted to go with this.
[01:52:35.160 --> 01:52:39.320]   So if I wanted to buy a 20 kilogram, which is about a 44-pound kettlebell,
[01:52:39.320 --> 01:52:43.880]   if I go to someplace like Dick's Sporting Goods, they're about 80 to 90 dollars.
[01:52:43.880 --> 01:52:45.880]   And you need...
[01:52:45.880 --> 01:52:49.160]   Yeah, in a full set, depending on where you get it.
[01:52:49.160 --> 01:52:52.440]   Now, I'm sure I could go on Craigslist and find some non-connected ones.
[01:52:52.440 --> 01:52:57.320]   But a full set of like six, like this ranges from 12 to 42 pounds.
[01:52:57.320 --> 01:53:02.280]   The weight increments, I would rather have five than six, but this is me.
[01:53:02.280 --> 01:53:06.040]   But that's about 300 dollars.
[01:53:06.040 --> 01:53:12.680]   I promise you that this guy did not spend 300 dollars on that kettlebell.
[01:53:12.680 --> 01:53:15.000]   Okay, but that's not the kettlebells that are...
[01:53:15.000 --> 01:53:16.440]   I can't get that kettlebell.
[01:53:16.440 --> 01:53:17.880]   If I go this far...
[01:53:17.880 --> 01:53:19.880]   This is from the turn of the century,
[01:53:20.440 --> 01:53:23.560]   the textbook of weightlifting by Arthur Saxon, one shilling,
[01:53:23.560 --> 01:53:25.480]   strongest man in the world.
[01:53:25.480 --> 01:53:26.200]   And what is he doing?
[01:53:26.200 --> 01:53:27.640]   He's lifting a kettlebell.
[01:53:27.640 --> 01:53:29.160]   I do kettlebell workouts.
[01:53:29.160 --> 01:53:30.440]   I like kettlebells.
[01:53:30.440 --> 01:53:31.880]   And this is the next...
[01:53:31.880 --> 01:53:35.320]   So the next best aspect of this is you get six weights in one.
[01:53:35.320 --> 01:53:37.880]   But the other thing is it's got the accelerometers and gyros,
[01:53:37.880 --> 01:53:39.960]   so you can do the workout correctly.
[01:53:39.960 --> 01:53:40.040]   That's kind of cool.
[01:53:40.040 --> 01:53:40.280]   Yeah.
[01:53:40.280 --> 01:53:42.280]   Which, if I ever...
[01:53:42.280 --> 01:53:46.120]   I mean, like seriously, you can really screw yourself up if you do a kettlebell.
[01:53:46.120 --> 01:53:48.520]   The whole reason a kettlebell is different than a dumbbell
[01:53:49.480 --> 01:53:51.880]   is because the weight is outside your hand.
[01:53:51.880 --> 01:53:55.320]   So there's momentum, which means you swing it,
[01:53:55.320 --> 01:53:58.040]   which means you can really hurt yourself,
[01:53:58.040 --> 01:53:59.640]   not just by hitting yourself in the head.
[01:53:59.640 --> 01:54:00.840]   Don't go and ever let me have one of those.
[01:54:00.840 --> 01:54:02.440]   But you could torque your back twer...
[01:54:02.440 --> 01:54:05.160]   So yeah, but on the other hand, if done right,
[01:54:05.160 --> 01:54:07.720]   they're really great for flexibility as well as strength.
[01:54:07.720 --> 01:54:13.480]   So yeah, so I am very excited about this.
[01:54:13.480 --> 01:54:17.800]   And I'm going to buy one at it,
[01:54:17.800 --> 01:54:19.000]   and I'll buy one at it.
[01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:21.800]   So let me know when they're available.
[01:54:21.800 --> 01:54:23.560]   They are available now.
[01:54:23.560 --> 01:54:24.120]   You can buy it now.
[01:54:24.120 --> 01:54:25.400]   It's $349.
[01:54:25.400 --> 01:54:27.160]   I do like...
[01:54:27.160 --> 01:54:27.800]   Don't do it.
[01:54:27.800 --> 01:54:29.320]   I do kettlebell with my trainer.
[01:54:29.320 --> 01:54:31.960]   And he's constantly adjusting.
[01:54:31.960 --> 01:54:32.600]   I'm like having...
[01:54:32.600 --> 01:54:32.920]   Yeah.
[01:54:32.920 --> 01:54:35.320]   So maybe you know what?
[01:54:35.320 --> 01:54:37.080]   You should contact them for a review.
[01:54:37.080 --> 01:54:39.160]   And I'll check them out when I...
[01:54:39.160 --> 01:54:40.120]   I'll check out the safety policies.
[01:54:40.120 --> 01:54:41.560]   I really like the name.
[01:54:41.560 --> 01:54:42.280]   Jack's jocks.
[01:54:42.280 --> 01:54:43.880]   Jack's jocks.
[01:54:43.880 --> 01:54:46.600]   I think their videos are stupid as all get out.
[01:54:46.600 --> 01:54:49.160]   But that's just me.
[01:54:49.160 --> 01:54:51.000]   The funny thing about that web page,
[01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:52.680]   it really seems to be more about the model
[01:54:52.680 --> 01:54:54.520]   than the kettlebell, which is often the corner.
[01:54:54.520 --> 01:54:57.880]   What are you selling kettlebell?
[01:54:57.880 --> 01:54:59.000]   I thought the first day I thought
[01:54:59.000 --> 01:55:00.120]   they were selling yoga pants.
[01:55:00.120 --> 01:55:00.600]   I didn't know.
[01:55:00.600 --> 01:55:06.920]   Yeah, their marketing is not geared towards me.
[01:55:06.920 --> 01:55:11.000]   Engadget's best of CES.
[01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:13.000]   Cherylin Lowe was on the show with us on Sunday.
[01:55:13.000 --> 01:55:14.920]   She said best of CES.
[01:55:14.920 --> 01:55:15.880]   So there you go.
[01:55:15.880 --> 01:55:17.400]   That's because Cherylin knows what's up.
[01:55:17.400 --> 01:55:18.440]   She knows what's up.
[01:55:18.440 --> 01:55:21.560]   And now Mr. Jeff Jarvis.
[01:55:21.560 --> 01:55:22.600]   I just wanted to know the record
[01:55:22.600 --> 01:55:26.520]   that actually I originally put the 10-year photo thing down here
[01:55:26.520 --> 01:55:30.200]   in the numbers because I was just going to make a passing reference to it.
[01:55:30.200 --> 01:55:31.880]   What a silly story it was.
[01:55:31.880 --> 01:55:32.440]   I was the one.
[01:55:32.440 --> 01:55:34.200]   And there it was.
[01:55:34.200 --> 01:55:37.000]   So I just want to know that I was not preparing a cycle fit.
[01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:39.080]   No, you know what?
[01:55:39.080 --> 01:55:39.640]   No, I have.
[01:55:39.640 --> 01:55:41.080]   I love it when you guys fight.
[01:55:41.080 --> 01:55:41.800]   That's awesome.
[01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:44.120]   See, that's the best.
[01:55:44.120 --> 01:55:46.280]   You're what's wrong with America, Leo, report.
[01:55:46.280 --> 01:55:48.520]   You're what's wrong with media.
[01:55:48.520 --> 01:55:50.600]   We went all Jerry Springer on you there.
[01:55:50.600 --> 01:55:51.400]   That was great.
[01:55:51.400 --> 01:55:52.360]   Yeah.
[01:55:52.360 --> 01:55:52.680]   All right.
[01:55:52.680 --> 01:55:54.280]   So here's what I stole one back,
[01:55:54.280 --> 01:55:55.800]   which I actually love this story.
[01:55:55.800 --> 01:55:57.320]   I'm fascinated by it.
[01:55:57.320 --> 01:56:00.440]   Because I've been tracking for my days as a TV critic
[01:56:00.440 --> 01:56:04.040]   way down how over the air broadcast audience
[01:56:04.040 --> 01:56:06.600]   has been shrinking, shrinking, shrinking, shrinking, shrinking, shrinking, right?
[01:56:06.600 --> 01:56:08.680]   Well, over the last eight years,
[01:56:08.680 --> 01:56:10.920]   over the air TV audiences up 48%.
[01:56:12.280 --> 01:56:13.800]   Over the years.
[01:56:13.800 --> 01:56:16.200]   But that story is really more about
[01:56:16.200 --> 01:56:17.160]   cord cutting, right?
[01:56:17.160 --> 01:56:19.880]   That the fact that people are getting ready to cable.
[01:56:19.880 --> 01:56:21.240]   Yes, this says there are two groups.
[01:56:21.240 --> 01:56:23.880]   There are groups who cannot afford cable.
[01:56:23.880 --> 01:56:24.360]   Right.
[01:56:24.360 --> 01:56:25.720]   And that's what we still have over the air.
[01:56:25.720 --> 01:56:27.080]   And why it's still free TV.
[01:56:27.080 --> 01:56:31.480]   Unfortunately, the quality of what you get free on TV in America has gone down rapidly.
[01:56:31.480 --> 01:56:36.200]   Ironically, because the argument was when we had three networks,
[01:56:36.200 --> 01:56:39.080]   whoa, if we get more networks, look how bad TV is.
[01:56:39.080 --> 01:56:41.640]   It'll get worse and abundance led to tremendous quality.
[01:56:41.640 --> 01:56:47.000]   But there was some kind of plateau we hit that then came down,
[01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:49.320]   partly because so much pay TV out there.
[01:56:49.320 --> 01:56:52.760]   So there are 16 million homes that haven't.
[01:56:52.760 --> 01:56:56.200]   That's one group is old people and others who can't afford.
[01:56:56.200 --> 01:57:01.960]   The other group is a cord cutters who have a direct account with the likes of that
[01:57:01.960 --> 01:57:06.440]   flexor such and then get news and whatever over the air.
[01:57:06.440 --> 01:57:07.880]   What's interesting to me about this though,
[01:57:07.880 --> 01:57:14.280]   is if it weren't for the, I don't know, regulation that enables these odd things,
[01:57:14.280 --> 01:57:21.880]   that enables cable to be a monopoly in your market and to have the must carry fees and on and on and on
[01:57:21.880 --> 01:57:22.360]   and on.
[01:57:22.360 --> 01:57:26.360]   I think that over the year would have gone down to virtually zero.
[01:57:26.360 --> 01:57:33.080]   But it's kind of artificially kept up because over the air has now become expensive because
[01:57:33.080 --> 01:57:38.120]   you have to get it in your cable package and you can only get it in a cable package.
[01:57:38.120 --> 01:57:42.760]   So when you cord cut from that, you can't get the TV anymore.
[01:57:42.760 --> 01:57:45.400]   So it's an artificial increase in over the year TV.
[01:57:45.400 --> 01:57:46.200]   That's my theory.
[01:57:46.200 --> 01:57:48.760]   I missed all of that.
[01:57:48.760 --> 01:57:52.360]   It's all. Well, you're a court cutter.
[01:57:52.360 --> 01:57:58.280]   I know I'm a court cutter, but I don't have access to digital TV signals where I live.
[01:57:58.280 --> 01:58:00.680]   So I can't actually get over the air.
[01:58:00.680 --> 01:58:02.840]   So if I want over the air, I have to buy cables.
[01:58:02.840 --> 01:58:04.120]   So I've never been able to get it.
[01:58:04.120 --> 01:58:05.160]   So what do you want?
[01:58:05.160 --> 01:58:06.600]   I thought you lived in Austin.
[01:58:06.600 --> 01:58:08.280]   I live in Austin.
[01:58:08.280 --> 01:58:11.000]   I have line of sight to all of the antennas.
[01:58:11.000 --> 01:58:13.000]   I just, and I've tried a Mohoulief.
[01:58:13.000 --> 01:58:15.160]   I've tried all these.
[01:58:15.160 --> 01:58:15.320]   All these.
[01:58:15.320 --> 01:58:16.760]   I like it.
[01:58:16.760 --> 01:58:23.160]   It is not an uncommon problem for people to struggle to get their DTV signals.
[01:58:23.160 --> 01:58:26.360]   It was one of the things when they did the auction.
[01:58:26.360 --> 01:58:31.480]   So when they converted the digital, the analog television signals to digital,
[01:58:31.480 --> 01:58:34.840]   and then used that spectrum, actually, it became the,
[01:58:34.840 --> 01:58:37.960]   I think it's a 700 megahertz spectrum for LTE networks.
[01:58:37.960 --> 01:58:42.120]   That was one of the things is it was going to reduce the range for some
[01:58:42.120 --> 01:58:45.320]   some shows for some people.
[01:58:45.320 --> 01:58:49.640]   And I just happened to be in actually all of my houses that have been in this,
[01:58:49.640 --> 01:58:51.400]   like bad area.
[01:58:51.400 --> 01:58:58.280]   The digital cliff area where unlike analog, which degrades, digital just either works or doesn't work.
[01:58:58.280 --> 01:58:59.560]   And there is this area.
[01:58:59.560 --> 01:59:02.840]   It's a, it's this margin where you could get analog signals,
[01:59:02.840 --> 01:59:06.920]   not maybe the perfect signals, but signals and you can't get digital at all.
[01:59:06.920 --> 01:59:09.080]   But that's, that's kind of shocking.
[01:59:09.080 --> 01:59:14.280]   No, I mean, it's, it's always been, it's always been super frustrating for me.
[01:59:14.280 --> 01:59:14.280]   Yeah.
[01:59:14.280 --> 01:59:18.040]   Because like, I've been at Port Cutter since 2007.
[01:59:18.040 --> 01:59:19.560]   People don't do over the air anymore.
[01:59:19.560 --> 01:59:22.600]   Now, the only one was the last time you watched over the air TV,
[01:59:22.600 --> 01:59:25.800]   uh, through a antenna, how many years has it been?
[01:59:25.800 --> 01:59:26.600]   Oh my God.
[01:59:26.600 --> 01:59:29.000]   A long, long time.
[01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:30.040]   Yeah, same here.
[01:59:30.040 --> 01:59:30.440]   I'm just.
[01:59:30.440 --> 01:59:32.280]   I can't remember rabbit ears.
[01:59:32.280 --> 01:59:38.040]   That was, that's, uh, gosh, I've it's 20 years, probably.
[01:59:38.040 --> 01:59:39.320]   What do you still?
[01:59:39.320 --> 01:59:40.040]   Long time.
[01:59:40.040 --> 01:59:43.400]   And we can't, we in Petaluma, where I've lived for more than 20 years,
[01:59:43.400 --> 01:59:48.120]   we can't get locals except for channel 50, which is kind of silly.
[01:59:48.760 --> 01:59:51.480]   You just, even the name channel 50 should tell you something.
[01:59:51.480 --> 01:59:56.680]   You know, uh, but, uh, because we can't get the San Francisco stations,
[01:59:56.680 --> 01:59:59.560]   but nowadays I don't have to have cable as long as I have data,
[01:59:59.560 --> 02:00:02.840]   because I can use YouTube TV or I like YouTube TV.
[02:00:02.840 --> 02:00:03.720]   I can watch all the locals.
[02:00:03.720 --> 02:00:08.520]   Lisa watches a football games on YouTube TV, even though we don't have any access here in the studio.
[02:00:08.520 --> 02:00:15.240]   So as long as you have data, but yeah, I think the best deal in the world is over the air
[02:00:15.240 --> 02:00:16.280]   high def television.
[02:00:16.280 --> 02:00:16.840]   That's great.
[02:00:17.400 --> 02:00:22.200]   So I'm making a starting list of, of, of things that we just don't need anymore that have
[02:00:22.200 --> 02:00:24.200]   other significance behind them.
[02:00:24.200 --> 02:00:31.240]   So rabbit ears is one, the phone booth is one, the phone itself, the tape recorder.
[02:00:31.240 --> 02:00:33.640]   This is going to be a long list and it's, but what's weird.
[02:00:33.640 --> 02:00:34.440]   What are some of yours?
[02:00:34.440 --> 02:00:35.480]   How it's adding.
[02:00:35.480 --> 02:00:38.200]   There's new stuff adding all the time to this list.
[02:00:38.200 --> 02:00:40.120]   You have any, any to throw at me?
[02:00:40.120 --> 02:00:42.520]   I have to, I thought, you know, the other day I was talking about this on the radio show,
[02:00:42.520 --> 02:00:43.240]   but I don't remember.
[02:00:43.240 --> 02:00:44.680]   How's keys?
[02:00:44.680 --> 02:00:46.440]   How's keys?
[02:00:46.440 --> 02:00:47.560]   She doesn't even use keys.
[02:00:47.560 --> 02:00:47.960]   She's so modern.
[02:00:47.960 --> 02:00:50.840]   I actually use house keys, but bidding people do not.
[02:00:50.840 --> 02:00:52.200]   I don't have a car key anymore.
[02:00:52.200 --> 02:00:53.800]   I have a fob.
[02:00:53.800 --> 02:00:58.520]   Okay, dude, you should actually keep your key because sometimes you'll park places.
[02:00:58.520 --> 02:01:01.080]   No, they don't, they don't have key Teslas.
[02:01:01.080 --> 02:01:01.720]   You have a key?
[02:01:01.720 --> 02:01:04.840]   Well, I have a, I have a radio fob thing.
[02:01:04.840 --> 02:01:05.320]   Yeah.
[02:01:05.320 --> 02:01:06.840]   That's, I don't call it key.
[02:01:06.840 --> 02:01:08.120]   So I call that my keys.
[02:01:08.120 --> 02:01:10.280]   That's my keys.
[02:01:10.280 --> 02:01:11.080]   They Tesla key.
[02:01:11.080 --> 02:01:12.280]   Fax machine.
[02:01:12.280 --> 02:01:12.760]   I know it's.
[02:01:12.760 --> 02:01:14.840]   Fax machine, I think it goes to nothing.
[02:01:14.840 --> 02:01:15.320]   No, no, no.
[02:01:15.320 --> 02:01:15.800]   Radio.
[02:01:15.800 --> 02:01:17.480]   I use a fax machine just the other day.
[02:01:17.480 --> 02:01:23.800]   You have to use a fax machine to legal stuff and FOIA requests
[02:01:23.800 --> 02:01:27.240]   because they want to charge you to print the papers.
[02:01:27.240 --> 02:01:27.800]   All right.
[02:01:27.800 --> 02:01:28.040]   Right.
[02:01:28.040 --> 02:01:29.720]   How about a radio?
[02:01:29.720 --> 02:01:33.960]   I have a radio, but it's more in case of disaster, right?
[02:01:33.960 --> 02:01:37.000]   You actually wake up to a clock radio.
[02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:38.120]   Yeah.
[02:01:38.120 --> 02:01:39.960]   Sometimes sometimes I wake up.
[02:01:39.960 --> 02:01:40.760]   If it's just.
[02:01:40.760 --> 02:01:42.440]   It's WXX Austin.
[02:01:43.720 --> 02:01:44.280]   I know it's Austin.
[02:01:44.280 --> 02:01:48.760]   My whole childhood, I had a clock radio that would come on with WCBS.
[02:01:48.760 --> 02:01:49.880]   I like the radio.
[02:01:49.880 --> 02:01:51.000]   News radio in New York.
[02:01:51.000 --> 02:01:52.440]   And I, and it's funny because,
[02:01:52.440 --> 02:01:57.240]   I mean, I remember RFK's assassination that waking up and hearing that on
[02:01:57.240 --> 02:01:59.400]   my clock radio.
[02:01:59.400 --> 02:02:00.360]   I had that for years.
[02:02:00.360 --> 02:02:02.040]   I was, I kind of missed that actually.
[02:02:02.040 --> 02:02:04.920]   Um, what made you started this?
[02:02:04.920 --> 02:02:08.440]   I wrote a post on media a couple of years ago about the death of Control S.
[02:02:08.440 --> 02:02:10.920]   For save.
[02:02:10.920 --> 02:02:12.280]   Save, right?
[02:02:12.280 --> 02:02:12.520]   No, no, no, no, no.
[02:02:12.520 --> 02:02:13.400]   I'm not saying this anymore.
[02:02:13.400 --> 02:02:14.840]   I mean, nobody says it.
[02:02:14.840 --> 02:02:16.680]   We don't need to save that all the time.
[02:02:16.680 --> 02:02:18.280]   This notion of constantly saving, right?
[02:02:18.280 --> 02:02:19.880]   So I wrote that thing and I thought of that.
[02:02:19.880 --> 02:02:20.680]   That's great.
[02:02:20.680 --> 02:02:23.160]   Um, oh, you can go on.
[02:02:23.160 --> 02:02:25.480]   Any other objects of change?
[02:02:25.480 --> 02:02:27.640]   Oh, God.
[02:02:27.640 --> 02:02:29.080]   CDs.
[02:02:29.080 --> 02:02:30.040]   Yeah.
[02:02:30.040 --> 02:02:30.600]   CDs.
[02:02:30.600 --> 02:02:32.360]   In fact, records.
[02:02:32.360 --> 02:02:34.200]   Physical media of all kinds.
[02:02:34.200 --> 02:02:35.080]   Physical media, yeah.
[02:02:35.080 --> 02:02:36.840]   Except interestingly books.
[02:02:36.840 --> 02:02:38.440]   I think we thought.
[02:02:38.440 --> 02:02:39.160]   And Polaroids.
[02:02:39.160 --> 02:02:40.200]   Those are bad.
[02:02:40.200 --> 02:02:41.160]   They're back, I know.
[02:02:41.160 --> 02:02:41.640]   They're back.
[02:02:41.640 --> 02:02:41.880]   They're back.
[02:02:41.880 --> 02:02:43.080]   Parents of younger children.
[02:02:43.080 --> 02:02:43.720]   Yeah.
[02:02:43.720 --> 02:02:48.120]   I, we thought that didn't we think that ebooks would completely replace
[02:02:48.120 --> 02:02:49.320]   pretty much right now.
[02:02:49.320 --> 02:02:49.560]   Oh, what?
[02:02:49.560 --> 02:02:50.040]   Oh.
[02:02:50.040 --> 02:02:51.160]   And in fact, it's quite the opposite.
[02:02:51.160 --> 02:02:51.880]   What behind me?
[02:02:51.880 --> 02:02:52.760]   Kindles are gone.
[02:02:52.760 --> 02:02:54.680]   And everybody has books again.
[02:02:54.680 --> 02:02:56.200]   Oh, I love my Kindle.
[02:02:56.200 --> 02:02:57.400]   Really?
[02:02:57.400 --> 02:03:00.680]   I buy, I have to buy a Kindle every year or every, every few months
[02:03:00.680 --> 02:03:01.320]   because I leave them on.
[02:03:01.320 --> 02:03:02.440]   Oh, which one do you have to see?
[02:03:02.440 --> 02:03:03.960]   I think they're overweight.
[02:03:03.960 --> 02:03:05.640]   I like the paper white.
[02:03:05.640 --> 02:03:06.600]   I have the Oasis.
[02:03:06.600 --> 02:03:07.960]   The very expensive new one.
[02:03:07.960 --> 02:03:08.840]   Oh, yeah.
[02:03:08.840 --> 02:03:09.880]   Is that one of the extra?
[02:03:09.880 --> 02:03:11.000]   I really use it.
[02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:11.640]   No.
[02:03:11.640 --> 02:03:13.400]   Well, I, I don't know.
[02:03:13.400 --> 02:03:15.000]   I got it because of the high resolution, right?
[02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:19.080]   And it's a faster page, it's got a faster processor.
[02:03:19.080 --> 02:03:23.560]   I never liked that slow page turn animation.
[02:03:23.560 --> 02:03:24.920]   They always kind of bugged me.
[02:03:24.920 --> 02:03:25.960]   So here's the rule.
[02:03:25.960 --> 02:03:26.520]   You can turn it on.
[02:03:26.520 --> 02:03:26.760]   Yeah.
[02:03:26.760 --> 02:03:31.400]   Remote controls are called clickers because they used to click.
[02:03:31.400 --> 02:03:31.880]   They did.
[02:03:31.880 --> 02:03:35.400]   Some of them would actually, it sounded like they were, they're
[02:03:35.400 --> 02:03:36.840]   sighing.
[02:03:36.840 --> 02:03:37.240]   They go.
[02:03:39.000 --> 02:03:40.360]   So how did they communicate?
[02:03:40.360 --> 02:03:42.040]   How did the clicker communicate with the TV?
[02:03:42.040 --> 02:03:42.920]   Sound, I think.
[02:03:42.920 --> 02:03:43.560]   With sound.
[02:03:43.560 --> 02:03:43.880]   Yeah.
[02:03:43.880 --> 02:03:44.840]   It was a sound cue.
[02:03:44.840 --> 02:03:45.640]   It was like the clapper.
[02:03:45.640 --> 02:03:50.760]   So you actually still have sound cues with certain IoT devices
[02:03:50.760 --> 02:03:51.960]   to connect them to your network.
[02:03:51.960 --> 02:03:53.400]   It's for authentication purposes.
[02:03:53.400 --> 02:03:54.440]   Oh, yes.
[02:03:54.440 --> 02:03:55.480]   They call it the chirp.
[02:03:55.480 --> 02:03:57.720]   But they're usually inaudible, right?
[02:03:57.720 --> 02:04:00.200]   In fact, Google invented that with Google with a Chromecast, I think.
[02:04:00.200 --> 02:04:01.320]   Maybe.
[02:04:01.320 --> 02:04:04.200]   But you also have it still with alarm systems.
[02:04:04.200 --> 02:04:06.840]   Old school alarm systems use sound to indicate.
[02:04:06.840 --> 02:04:07.400]   The hell?
[02:04:07.400 --> 02:04:08.520]   They use dial tones.
[02:04:08.520 --> 02:04:10.520]   Actually, Helm doesn't use sound, but it uses Bluetooth.
[02:04:10.520 --> 02:04:12.200]   They'll eat authenticate your phone.
[02:04:12.200 --> 02:04:17.560]   You can't put a Helm on your setup of the Helm unless you can bring your phone next to it,
[02:04:17.560 --> 02:04:20.200]   which is actually a clever authentication.
[02:04:20.200 --> 02:04:22.440]   There's a lot of those.
[02:04:22.440 --> 02:04:22.680]   Okay.
[02:04:22.680 --> 02:04:23.400]   I have to leave.
[02:04:23.400 --> 02:04:26.120]   Go fill your empty tummy.
[02:04:26.120 --> 02:04:27.240]   Stacey Higginbotham.
[02:04:27.240 --> 02:04:27.480]   You did.
[02:04:27.480 --> 02:04:31.480]   I just have, I have an appointment I've got to get to.
[02:04:31.480 --> 02:04:31.880]   Bye bye.
[02:04:31.880 --> 02:04:33.160]   Bye.
[02:04:33.160 --> 02:04:34.520]   Thank you guys.
[02:04:34.520 --> 02:04:36.040]   I almost, I almost did the automatic.
[02:04:36.040 --> 02:04:36.920]   Like, I love you.
[02:04:38.040 --> 02:04:39.880]   But that's for my husband, not y'all.
[02:04:39.880 --> 02:04:40.920]   We all love each other.
[02:04:40.920 --> 02:04:41.320]   We do.
[02:04:41.320 --> 02:04:43.800]   Yes.
[02:04:43.800 --> 02:04:44.280]   All right.
[02:04:44.280 --> 02:04:45.160]   It's all theater.
[02:04:45.160 --> 02:04:45.480]   Cheers you guys.
[02:04:45.480 --> 02:04:46.280]   I love you.
[02:04:46.280 --> 02:04:47.160]   Bye, Stacey.
[02:04:47.160 --> 02:04:47.160]   Bye.
[02:04:47.160 --> 02:04:47.720]   Bye.
[02:04:47.720 --> 02:04:47.720]   Bye.
[02:04:47.720 --> 02:04:47.720]   Bye.
[02:04:47.720 --> 02:04:47.720]   Bye.
[02:04:47.720 --> 02:04:47.720]   Bye.
[02:04:47.720 --> 02:04:47.720]   Bye.
[02:04:47.720 --> 02:04:47.720]   Bye.
[02:04:47.720 --> 02:04:47.720]   Bye.
[02:04:47.720 --> 02:04:50.200]   Thank you, Jeff.
[02:04:50.200 --> 02:04:53.240]   We do this week in Google every Wednesday with Jeff Jarvis.
[02:04:53.240 --> 02:04:54.440]   He's a professor of journalism.
[02:04:54.440 --> 02:04:58.280]   Well, he's really the Leonard Tau professor for journalistic innovation,
[02:04:58.280 --> 02:05:02.520]   actually at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York.
[02:05:02.520 --> 02:05:06.760]   Blogger@buzzmachine.com, author of many of fine book, including what would Google do.
[02:05:06.760 --> 02:05:08.920]   When is your new book coming out?
[02:05:08.920 --> 02:05:12.280]   I don't, I haven't, I don't even, I'm still thinking about it.
[02:05:12.280 --> 02:05:14.600]   I have whiteboards filled with notes.
[02:05:14.600 --> 02:05:16.680]   I think it should be a film filled with books.
[02:05:16.680 --> 02:05:17.640]   Moral Panic.
[02:05:17.640 --> 02:05:20.440]   I was thinking about a book.
[02:05:20.440 --> 02:05:23.000]   I think the third book in my list is a techno panic book.
[02:05:23.000 --> 02:05:23.320]   Yes.
[02:05:23.320 --> 02:05:25.160]   Thanks, Jeff.
[02:05:25.160 --> 02:05:25.960]   Thanks, Stacey.
