[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.640]   It's time for Twig this week in Google, Matthew Ingram joins Jeff and Gina.
[00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.800]   We'll talk about Glass. We're learning a lot more. In fact, we'll also talk about
[00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:14.400]   Soric, who's hacked Glass. The jailbreak is here. I'll give you a little preview of the Galaxy S4
[00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.680]   compared to the HTC One 2. It's all next on Twig.

[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.760]   It's time for Twig this week in Google to show the covers.
[00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.560]   Google and the cloud, Facebook, Twitter, all of that stuff.
[00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.360]   Really frankly, anything that our esteemed panel wants to cover.
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.480]   Because when you get people like this together in a room, talking,
[00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.960]   I'm not going to be the guy that says you.
[00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.040]   That's off topic. We'll start with Matthew Ingram all the way over here from Gigah Ome just back from
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.360]   Itali. Hello Matthew.
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.320]   Hi.
[00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.280]   Good to have you.
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.960]   You're in Perugia for what conference?
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.920]   The International Journalism Festival.
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.920]   Festi, it wasn't a conference.
[00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.040]   It was a festival.
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.760]   Yeah, like a conference, but more fun.
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.160]   Sounds awesome.
[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.640]   Awesome.
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.160]   Also with us, Professor of Journalism at the City University of New York,
[00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.560]   they're author of what Google do and public parts.
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.320]   These team Jeff Jarvis.
[00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.760]   Logger.
[00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.120]   You're going to reverse order.
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.880]   I am. I'm throwing you, aren't I?
[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:15.520]   Usually I-
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:16.400]   Hey, you gotta mix it up.
[00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.720]   Yeah.
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:17.600]   Mix it up.
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.840]   Yeah.
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.040]   I usually start with ladies first.
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:25.200]   Gina Trappani of smarterware.org, founding editor of Life Hacker and a creator of ThinkUp
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.640]   at ThinkUp.com.
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:27.680]   Hello everybody.
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.200]   Oh, and host of all about Android.
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.120]   Yes, of course.
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:37.280]   So yesterday, I let you guys, this is a review unit from AT&T of the Galaxy S4.
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.760]   I just heard mine shipped today from-
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:45.280]   I bought the unlocked European one from Expansis, which has eight-
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.480]   has the octa core.
[00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:47.520]   It's an eight core.
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.440]   This is AT&T's.
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.040]   This is a quad core snapdragon.
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.480]   No LTE then?
[00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.040]   No LTE, but I'm going to run it on T-Mobile, and their HSPA+ is pretty fast here.
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.040]   So I don't need LTE.
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.280]   I wanted an unlock phone for travel, right?
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.720]   Matthew, you need an unlock phone?
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:03.120]   Yeah.
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.600]   Yeah.
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:04.160]   I agree.
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.960]   And, but Samsung did lend us this-
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.280]   or I guess AT&T lend us this for a review.
[00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.960]   And I will review it on before you buy next week, but we did a little unboxing yesterday.
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:16.480]   You guys played with it on that about Android.
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:17.200]   What were your thoughts?
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.600]   Oh, we checked it on and all about Android.
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:22.400]   Didn't you?
[00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:23.280]   Yeah, we did.
[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.000]   And we totally did.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.600]   Ron, thank you for lending it to us.
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:26.400]   We really like it.
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.600]   It's a beautiful phone.
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:32.160]   I think the one thing we were concerned about was that the storage, a lot of storage,
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.000]   it ships with like four times the word already used.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   Yeah, it's only 16 gigs total, but you can't put an SD card.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.600]   My experience with Android though is SD cards don't work as well as internal memory.
[00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.920]   Have you had that?
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.920]   Right.
[00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.040]   You can't put apps on it.
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:45.760]   Right.
[00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:46.400]   Well, you can.
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.640]   It's like half full, right?
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:49.600]   When it ships?
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:50.320]   Yeah, let me see.
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:51.760]   Let's just check.
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:52.720]   So, uh...
[00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:53.840]   It's a phone problem too.
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:59.280]   And I've already put apps on here, so this is not going to show what it has when it ships,
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:03.280]   but this is the other thing by goodness gracious, there are a lot of settings.
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.560]   This is the settings panel.
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.000]   And it's now tabbed.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.760]   So I presume I'll go to my device and look for storage.
[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.440]   You got to get used to a whole new way of finding stuff.
[00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.160]   Now I don't see it there.
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:15.440]   Maybe maybe under more.
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:17.280]   Yeah, storage.
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.960]   So that was tab three.
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:20.560]   Total space left after it.
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.520]   Now I've installed 100 apps, is 9 gigs.
[00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.440]   I've got two gigs of applications.
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.160]   I don't have any pictures, videos or audio on here yet.
[00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.480]   So, oh, I'm sorry.
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:31.760]   Total, oh, wait a minute.
[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:32.560]   Yeah.
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.040]   Total space, 9.62 gigs.
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.840]   That's total available space after I put my stuff on 6.9 gigs.
[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.920]   So you are going to buy it.
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.600]   You need to buy an SD card in here.
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:48.000]   And absolutely, there won't be room for pictures, videos or audio on the main storage you'll have
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.120]   to put on the SD card.
[00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.120]   And you can't uninstall it.
[00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.880]   It's on the same size as those the things.
[00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:53.280]   It's odd.
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:58.240]   Yeah, you can't uninstall these Samsung apps without rooting, I presume.
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.800]   Right.
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:59.120]   Right.
[00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:05.200]   So that was a little bit like, not loving that, but beautiful looking, good looking phone.
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:06.000]   I mean, I'm really torn.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.200]   I love the HSC one.
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.800]   I just, I love that the speakers on the front.
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:09.680]   I love the design of it.
[00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:10.400]   It's just the hardware.
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.080]   It looks really nice.
[00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.640]   But I am curious about the Samsung apps in particular.
[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:18.480]   And, and this works really, looks really nice.
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.480]   You have this for inside by side, right?
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:21.600]   Yeah, here's identical.
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:27.440]   Now, I should say on the Galaxy S4 AMOLED, I've set it to movie mode,
[00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:31.120]   which supposedly is the most color accurate mode.
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.840]   It's not that bright Samsung AMOLED look.
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.080]   It's the HTC thinner.
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.320]   They're pretty similar.
[00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.480]   HTC is a little, maybe a little thinner.
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:42.320]   It feels heavier because of its metal.
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:46.320]   The Samsung, hey, I already remarked the fact because it's plastic.
[00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:47.280]   It's feels cheesy.
[00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:52.320]   It's made even cheesier by the pseudo chrome on the edge here, which it just really feels
[00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:52.720]   junky.
[00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:53.520]   That's plastic?
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:54.080]   It's plastic.
[00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:55.200]   It's all plastic.
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.160]   And that's fine because it's, you get better antenna characteristics.
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.040]   If, you know, if it's a question of hardware,
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:07.120]   the nice thing about the one is it has 32 and 64 gigabyte models.
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.280]   So you can have plenty of storage on here.
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:13.680]   You can't add an SD card, but in some ways, I think main storage trumps SD because
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.080]   you can use all of it for apps and so forth.
[00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:20.080]   The screen, I think, is better on the HTC One.
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.000]   Both are 1080p screens.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   HTC One is a higher dot pitch.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:26.480]   It's a slightly smaller 4.7 compared to five.
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:29.760]   But I think it's also because it's an IPS LCD.
[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:35.120]   I think the screen is more accurate than a lot of people love super AMOLED look that
[00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.680]   rich saturation, the deep blacks.
[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:41.680]   And I have to agree, but this screen to me, the HTC One screens a better screen.
[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:48.000]   Battery life is poor on both of them, but because the HTC is not removable,
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:50.480]   it's more of an issue.
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:53.040]   I actually am buying a Mophie case for this HTC One.
[00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:57.520]   The Galaxy S4 I'm going to do is I've done with other Samsung phones,
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:01.840]   which is just by a separate battery because it's very easy to pry off the back on the
[00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:03.600]   galaxies and put a new battery in.
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:07.280]   I think that's a real advantage to having that's
[00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:08.720]   where plastic gets you somewhere.
[00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:14.800]   You know, and if you're going to put it in a case, and I think in both cases,
[00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:19.200]   you probably are, then who cares what the actual phone feels like?
[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:21.520]   Both are very fast.
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:25.600]   Some people have complained about, and I haven't had this S4 long enough,
[00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:29.360]   but I have read reviews that complain about some hesitation and sluggishness on the S.
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:33.840]   By the way, you notice I have replaced Sense and Touchwiz with my own launcher.
[00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:37.200]   I use the Nova launcher and I far prefer different widgets as well.
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:42.080]   But that's going to be the big difference, in my opinion,
[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:47.280]   and the deciding factor in which phone you get is, you know, yes, you're right.
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:51.120]   You know, the front facing speakers are so much superior on the HTC One.
[00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:52.640]   That boom said really is great.
[00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:55.920]   Yeah, and they're running a commercial centered around the speakers,
[00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:57.920]   like, you know, basically saying it makes sense.
[00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:00.080]   If you want to listen to something that's going to be facing forward,
[00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:02.480]   right, it has like bands on stage facing the back.
[00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:05.120]   And it really gets the message across.
[00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:06.160]   Yeah, they're really smart.
[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:07.440]   I mean, you know, one hand I think,
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:12.320]   well, am I really watching something that I care about the audio being perfect on my phone?
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:15.920]   No, but you know, increasingly people watch videos and pass their phone around,
[00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:18.160]   and you know, listen to voicemails on speaker.
[00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:19.680]   I mean, it really does make a lot more sense.
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:22.480]   You know, you might, because of these good speakers,
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:30.160]   it might change things a little bit because you can actually just prop the HTC One up
[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:33.360]   and listen to a book or even music, and it sounds good enough.
[00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:37.760]   So in a case where you might have bought external speakers for your phone,
[00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:39.760]   it's not, it's pretty good.
[00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:43.200]   It's certainly good enough for an audio book, the surprisingly good sound.
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:48.000]   But the big difference, I think, is the customizations that both manufacturers did to Android.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.080]   I think that's really, especially for our audience,
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:51.680]   where it's going to be a deciding factor.
[00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:56.240]   And it's really going to depend on how you, what you do, what you want your phone to do.
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:59.360]   HTC Sense dumbs this phone down considerably.
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:01.200]   And there's things you cannot change.
[00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:02.880]   I'll give you a really simple example.
[00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:04.560]   My lock screen.
[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:07.760]   Now, I happen to like the HTC Sense lock screen a lot.
[00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:11.200]   I'm using a photo screen, so it's doing a photo album.
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.560]   It's got time and weather.
[00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:17.600]   But these four, five icons on the bottom, the controls, phone, message,
[00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:21.440]   lock, internet, and camera cannot be changed.
[00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:22.400]   I don't, I use Chrome.
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:24.240]   I don't use the built-in internet browser.
[00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:26.960]   I don't use the AT&T messages instead of the standard message.
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:28.720]   So I would like to change these.
[00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:30.960]   On the Samsung, the lock screen is infinitely.
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:33.280]   In fact, perhaps too configurable.
[00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:36.800]   Notice I've taken off the life companion, replaced it with my name.
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.640]   That was one of the first things I did.
[00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:39.840]   But you could put widgets on here.
[00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:42.000]   You can really change it.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.880]   HTC Sense is much more locked down.
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:48.960]   There are not nearly as many settings when you go to the system settings.
[00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:51.840]   And of course with Sense, as with Samsung's Touchwiz,
[00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:55.520]   they've changed how the standard Android settings look and work.
[00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:59.360]   And AT&T has configured this too, and this may be different for you.
[00:09:59.360 --> 00:10:02.320]   But AT&T has taken away some things that I find very valuable.
[00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:08.400]   For instance, in power usage, I want to know, is it this prettier than the Android look?
[00:10:08.400 --> 00:10:12.400]   But I want to know when it comes to usage, how much has devoted to the screen?
[00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:16.000]   AT&T or HTC, I'm not sure which has disabled that I believe it's.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.360]   They obviously went out of their way to obscure that information from you.
[00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:21.920]   Because the screen is a big part of the drain.
[00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:22.960]   Yeah.
[00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:26.320]   Yeah. But the fact that they went out of their way to remove that from the list.
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:27.760]   I find that very annoying.
[00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:30.160]   Yeah. It's shady.
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:30.960]   It's shady.
[00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:31.520]   It's what it is.
[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:32.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:32.560]   Yeah.
[00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:37.120]   And so that's going to be the negative on the HTC One.
[00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:39.440]   If you're the kind of person that really wants to get in there and tweak it,
[00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:42.400]   Samsung has gone the exact opposite direction.
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:44.000]   I've never seen so many settings.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:49.520]   I've never seen this rivals Facebook for the number of tweaks and settings and things you can do.
[00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:51.040]   Hundreds of settings in here.
[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:52.400]   Everything is configurable.
[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:56.720]   If you're the kind of person that wants a phone where you customize it up the wazoo,
[00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:59.840]   if you'll forgive my French, this is a much better choice for you.
[00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:03.040]   If you're the kind of person that wants a phone just to be beautiful and functional,
[00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:07.520]   then the one I have to say I really like the zoies and the highlights that the HTC One makes.
[00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:10.880]   I think that that is a great feature.
[00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:13.360]   I like the low light capability of the camera.
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:17.200]   I think the HTC One camera does rival the iPhone 5, even in bright light.
[00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:20.160]   It's a very nice camera despite its four megapixels.
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:22.560]   Samsung opted for this 13 megapixel camera.
[00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:27.120]   The other thing about that you'll notice with the Galaxy is for immediately,
[00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:30.400]   the load up of crapware is unbelievable.
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:33.440]   Things like scrolling a page as you look up and down.
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:35.200]   I don't know anybody who's going to use this.
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:39.440]   The camera settings go on and on and on and on.
[00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:42.080]   I mean, there's so much you can do with this thing.
[00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:46.640]   Again, if you like that kind of thing,
[00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:50.320]   if you like to be able to customize everything like crazy, you're going to be very happy.
[00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:55.040]   A lot of it feels like junkware and certainly some of the things like hovering
[00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:59.840]   and scrolling with the eyes and stuff feel a little bit gimmicky.
[00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:06.480]   However, I played a little bit, for instance, with the Samsung modes are very interesting.
[00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:11.360]   Let me see if I can find the gallery here.
[00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:12.640]   I did a-- what is that?
[00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:14.960]   They call that the highlight mode or the superstar mode,
[00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:21.360]   where you could take a picture of a person moving and get all the images.
[00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:30.240]   They want to have a few things sort of like this, but I think that's still also a little bit
[00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:32.000]   gimmicky.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.680]   I don't know. There's so many modes in this thing.
[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:35.840]   You use such a good staff, Leo.
[00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:37.120]   They play along.
[00:12:37.120 --> 00:12:39.040]   They really do. They're so totally game.
[00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:39.600]   Yeah, they're good.
[00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:42.960]   So you tap this mode button and it has auto mode,
[00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:45.440]   which is probably where you mostly work beauty face.
[00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:49.200]   Best photo takes a series of pictures, selects the best.
[00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:50.560]   It takes eight pictures.
[00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:54.400]   Best face, you take a number of pictures, five pictures of the group,
[00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:59.680]   and then pick which part of the group you want the best face from and combine the five pictures.
[00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:02.640]   The one does something very similar, although I couldn't get it to work.
[00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:05.280]   Sound and Shot is a still where there's audio behind it.
[00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:08.880]   Drama is the one that I was showing where it's multiple pictures of somebody moving
[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:10.000]   in a single frame.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:16.480]   The stupidest one, there's animated photo, which is the stupidest one is the one,
[00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:22.960]   of course, with you in the middle of it, where it takes pictures from both the front and the back
[00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:25.360]   cameras. Very, very strange.
[00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:27.120]   I don't.
[00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:28.480]   Oh, the dad photo, right?
[00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:29.680]   Yeah, the dad photo.
[00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:30.080]   Yeah.
[00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:31.760]   The dad's always taking pictures with kids.
[00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:32.240]   Yeah, really weird.
[00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:34.320]   Yeah, I have a few of those.
[00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:37.280]   And you have different frame treatments and so forth,
[00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:39.280]   but it just to me, it looks very odd.
[00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:42.960]   Here, I'll show you what mine looked like because it looks like my head's just floating
[00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:45.120]   in the middle of the picture.
[00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:51.040]   I got to tell you, I'm kind of exhausted just going through all those.
[00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:52.640]   This feels like the Microsoft Word.
[00:13:52.640 --> 00:13:53.040]   It is.
[00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:56.880]   Like it would just just get more and more setting, more and more features to just to sell
[00:13:56.880 --> 00:13:58.720]   another new version, right?
[00:13:58.720 --> 00:13:58.960]   Right.
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:13:59.920]   It would just be exhausting.
[00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:02.880]   Like as a user, you'd be like, I just want to bold some text, right?
[00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:04.240]   Yeah, or take a photo.
[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:06.400]   Yeah, I just liked it's photo.
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:11.520]   I don't want to like scroll through this endless carousel of special shots that
[00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:12.240]   I don't even know what they mean.
[00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:13.440]   What is beauty face?
[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:14.400]   I don't know.
[00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:18.960]   Beauty face is going to help me out on this HD camera here.
[00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:20.160]   Yeah, beauty face.
[00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:21.200]   I don't want beauty.
[00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:22.320]   So you're exactly right.
[00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:25.840]   And so to me, this is the kind of philosophical difference between the two.
[00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:28.160]   You know, you really should add the Nexus 4 as the third choice.
[00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:30.560]   The Nexus 4 is the pure Google phone, right?
[00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:31.840]   That's what I've got.
[00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:35.360]   Yeah, no LTE, but in every other respect, a pure phone.
[00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:38.720]   This is making me hold all the more dearly to my Nexus 4.
[00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:38.960]   Yeah.
[00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:42.560]   And hope the Google comes out with a pure phone soon, like in two weeks.
[00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:48.160]   I think what Google could do at Google I/O is exactly do this X phone from Motorola
[00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:54.560]   that has the power and capability of something like the HTC One without all of the restrictions
[00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:55.280]   and the gloss.
[00:14:55.280 --> 00:15:00.720]   But if you want to, if you're choosing between these two and you want a phone that just does
[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:04.000]   a great job as a beautiful phone, I'd like the HTC One.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.400]   If you want more capability to customize than I think the Galaxy S4, they're both very good phones,
[00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:09.760]   very similar category.
[00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:15.680]   They do best the Nexus 4 in a number of ways because they're more recent.
[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:18.480]   So the real question is what's Google going to do to respond to these?
[00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:20.400]   Because these are now the standard, I think.
[00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:22.960]   Yeah, for what it's worth on all of it, Android.
[00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:25.040]   Oh, sorry, Jeff.
[00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:25.520]   Go ahead.
[00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:28.640]   I was just going to say, like for what it's worth on all about Android,
[00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:33.200]   the consensus is that we, you know, the really nice handsets, but we're all sort of biased.
[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:37.200]   Of course, it's a show about Android, but we're all sort of biased for the pure Android experience.
[00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:41.840]   So Ron, Ron was saying last night was you showing his phone like, "Yeah, I like this.
[00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:43.760]   I just don't like the extra software." And I feel the same way.
[00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:47.920]   I've been sort of true to the Nexus line since the beginning.
[00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:53.280]   And while I'm tempted by the HTC One because the hardware design is really nice, I just,
[00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:58.800]   I just want my Android just straight out of Google and see exactly what the sort of default
[00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:00.000]   intended experience is.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:04.080]   I'm with you, Gina. I don't like a lot of that software and stuff.
[00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:06.640]   It makes me not want it. It makes me want to know.
[00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:07.280]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:08.480]   Well, it's a question then.
[00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:14.080]   What would be wrong for a Samsung to say it's an option that you can clean it up and just go back
[00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:14.800]   to pure Google?
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:20.080]   Well, it's going to happen because as it may happen first with the HTC One, the
[00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:26.400]   Cyanogen folks immediately bought HTC One's. HTC supports an unlocked bootloader right out of
[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:33.600]   the box. And so I think people will probably root it in Cyanogen mod. I think they already have a beta,
[00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:40.080]   early beta mod. So presumably you will be able to at some point put 4.2 on here, pure.
[00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:45.280]   That might be kind of interesting. Although I do like some of the HTC features.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:51.360]   I mean, I just I wish that companies like Samsung would kind of take the Facebook home
[00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:56.400]   approach where it's like, hey, here's the Samsung launcher. You have an option to set
[00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:59.200]   as your default launcher. There's the phone ships with it as your default launcher,
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:03.280]   but you can change it to something else. Here's a folder full of Samsung apps,
[00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:07.920]   which you cannot install and which you might buy. It's set as your default. But you know what?
[00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:11.600]   When you click on tap on camera, you can choose. Do you want the built-in Android camera?
[00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:15.680]   Do you want the Samsung camera? You tap on the always box. You make your choice.
[00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:21.280]   It just would be so respectful to users to say, hey, give a choice. Like, hey,
[00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:25.200]   this is our product. We're going to make them the defaults, but you're free to back out and
[00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:30.400]   choose something else if you want. I'd love to see that, but that's just not how it works.
[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:36.160]   Samsung's trying to differentiate. They're trying to say this is our platform. They didn't say
[00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:39.760]   the word Android. I think they said the word Android wants during their whole presentation.
[00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:42.880]   So they're trying to dress it up in Samsung style.
[00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:48.080]   Does they sing it, Gina? Before we show that video,
[00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:54.720]   which we are going to, I just want to say that I think this is a trend in tech in general.
[00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:59.360]   I've noticed this and it came up on Twitter on Sunday because you're talking about Microsoft.
[00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:04.880]   Very, very reluctantly saying, well, we might add, well, actually, they haven't said the rumors are,
[00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:11.360]   they might add boot to desktop and Windows 8. I blame Apple. I think Apple paved the way in
[00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:17.360]   ignoring users and saying, are we're the highway? We believe we know exactly how it should be,
[00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:21.520]   and we're going to give you that. Now, to Apple's credit, they were often right. Steve had great
[00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:27.600]   taste, right? Yeah, only one's right. But what happens is everybody looks at them and says,
[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:32.160]   oh, maybe this is the way to differentiate in a market that's becoming commoditized,
[00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:36.240]   and there's nothing more commoditized than Android phones. Maybe the way to differentiate is to
[00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:41.920]   tell the users what they want. And I think Windows 8 is a good example of a company by Fiat saying,
[00:18:41.920 --> 00:18:47.120]   you will do it this way or no other way. Microsoft's done it. I think Samsung's doing it. I think
[00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:52.560]   HTC is doing it. It's the way they differentiate, but I agree it's disrespectful to users. I think
[00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:57.200]   we should come step forward as users and just say exactly what you just said, Gina, give us the choice.
[00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:00.720]   What drew me to these devices was the Google apps.
[00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:09.360]   Yes, exactly. That's exactly right. Google Translate. I want Google Maps.
[00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:13.440]   If someone else comes out with a better navigation app that hasn't happened yet,
[00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:20.800]   but I want Google Maps. I want Gmail. That's the offering. Right now, that's the offering. I know
[00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:25.840]   that's not what Samsung wants. Samsung wants you to buy their phone because the Samsung apps are
[00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:31.840]   superior, but they just haven't proven that yet. And look at it. If I have cameras, they're not
[00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:37.440]   getting there. Right. And if I like their hardware, one different software, what's the harm to them
[00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:46.400]   if I still buy their phone? Right. And the other thing is, by me now has a gigantic Samsung
[00:19:46.400 --> 00:19:53.440]   display space, really big. It's like a whole store in the store. And so, which is A was interesting.
[00:19:53.440 --> 00:20:01.120]   Then B, I was playing with the Note 8, which I'm tempted by versus my Nexus 7 because it has the
[00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:07.040]   pen and the pen makes sense on something that size, I think. So, I might buy that Samsung thing,
[00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:11.440]   and I'm not so dependent on the tablet as I am on the phone for all these applications I use,
[00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:15.040]   and maybe I'm going to be okay with the Samsung stuff there. And I need the pen stuff there.
[00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:17.920]   I'm okay with it. I'm not anti at all. I just want a choice.
[00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:25.600]   Yeah. I mean, it's funny. I've always been interested more in software than in hardware.
[00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:30.000]   I'm not much of a gadget freak, but I look at that HTC one. I'm like, that's a beautiful.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:38.400]   Well, that's the thing. The Nexus 4 is only 768. This is 1080. You don't have LTE. You can get LTE
[00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:45.760]   on the HTC one if you go with an LTE carrier. So, I'm not a huge fan of the Nexus 4. I think
[00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:50.160]   you make some hardware compromises. So, you're saying, I want pure hardware, I want pure software,
[00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:54.160]   and I'm willing to compromise on the hardware. It's more important to me. Yeah. Which is odd,
[00:20:54.160 --> 00:21:01.440]   but I want simplicity. And it's not like you're giving up. You get all the same things plus
[00:21:01.440 --> 00:21:06.320]   on these phones. There's a few things you're giving up on the one, particularly where there
[00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:11.920]   are just things you can't customize. That's a pain. Yeah. And that's a little paternalistic.
[00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:16.640]   I'm a little unhappy about that. But again, I'm sure I could root this and do something with it.
[00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:21.840]   But you know, those companies like Samsung should look at people I know who are Apple
[00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:27.520]   devotees and have had iPhones forever. And they're using Google apps on the iPhone.
[00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:31.200]   Because the apps are better. And then eventually that probably
[00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:34.720]   might suck them into going fully Android.
[00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:40.000]   Well, I think that you can make that case. And I think Google's smart to be making these
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:45.280]   reference phones. I really felt the Nexus 4 was a developer phone. I was surprised to see how
[00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:50.480]   much consumer acceptance. I thought it was at first too, but it's a good phone. People like it.
[00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:57.120]   I'm kind of tempted to get one just to have, you know, to see the differences, I guess.
[00:21:57.120 --> 00:22:00.240]   Because I don't know what I actually don't know what vanilla Android looks like.
[00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:04.800]   I think it's I think it's so good. I would say it's the pixel of phone.
[00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:08.720]   Ha ha ha. You have to do that, don't you? You have to do that.
[00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:16.160]   All right. Let's play the. So Jeff, Jeff and Google Plus posted this. And do we know we don't
[00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:18.320]   know where it came from? No.
[00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:21.920]   No. It's the same time.
[00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:25.760]   Pardon me? It's the S4 launch event from India. So it was in my eyes.
[00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:29.760]   Indian S4 launch event. Roll it back so we can see it from the beginning. You got to see it from
[00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:35.840]   the beginning here. Sorry. And this, by the way, I did a little research. This guy is not just some
[00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:40.160]   guy off the street. He's a fairly well-known Bollywood star, up and coming Bollywood star Ron
[00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:46.880]   Vyrs Singh. It's interesting that you size image for this.
[00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:51.360]   So it's very Bollywood. And if you're going to launch a phone in India, why not?
[00:22:51.360 --> 00:23:14.720]   [Music]
[00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:18.960]   I like it.
[00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:32.400]   You got to understand your market. I think culturally this fits the markets Bollywood.
[00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:40.640]   It's crazy, Garish. I mean, it's much like the Broadway launch of the car.
[00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:46.400]   I'm not Indian, so I don't know. But my sense is this probably speaks to the Indian
[00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:52.400]   customer better than the Broadway thing spoke to American customers. Well, Broadway thing didn't
[00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:55.440]   speak with American customers, but that's the point. No, and I know enough. But see, I don't
[00:23:55.440 --> 00:24:01.360]   not Indian, so I don't know. But I would guess this is more... I mean, he's doing the dance. That's not
[00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:06.080]   Bollywood. That's the side dance. Yeah, but it's a... Well, obviously you don't watch Bollywood movies,
[00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:13.840]   dude. Now, you're right. You don't watch a lot of vials. The normal reaction of people who've
[00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:18.480]   not seen Bollywood before is, boy, that's cheesy and Garish. Well, I mean, I've seen Bollywood
[00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:25.440]   routines like in various shows. There's been one in... There was one in... Was there one in
[00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:30.800]   Glee? There was one in Smash? Felicia Day did one with... Yeah, she did a great one. Yeah, she did a great one.
[00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:39.440]   So... Yeah. This follows. There was also a Samsung appliance marketing launch in South Africa,
[00:24:39.440 --> 00:24:43.440]   which for no good reason had lots of bikini women, and it was caused to be fewer there.
[00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:49.840]   Something about Samsung marketing that's... Well, we've decided that too much money is the problem.
[00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:56.720]   Because somebody pointed out that the amount of money dedicated to marketing is directly
[00:24:56.720 --> 00:25:00.320]   correlated to the amount of money they're making. So the more they make on the phone, the more they
[00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:03.680]   have to spend on marketing. And at some point, you have too much money to spend on marketing, obviously.
[00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:08.560]   Well, I was saying on all that, Andrea, last night, they worked. I mean, we're talking about it.
[00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:13.200]   We've played it on two shows now. I mean, you know, we're saying that it was... That it's a little
[00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:19.280]   embarrassing. I mean, I was a little embarrassed for the guy who leads singer. But hey, it was fun.
[00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:23.440]   I mean, I watched it. Yeah, and I just think we don't have the cultural
[00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:30.160]   ability to... To context for it. Well, judging from the Broadway launch in New York, I was
[00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:36.800]   like, "Oh." That we have the cultural context to pan. Yes. And I love Broadway. I love Broadway. I do.
[00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:40.320]   I do too. And yeah, Virgil just said in the chat room, Big Bang Theory did do a ball of
[00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:44.480]   routine. That's right. Bollywood's everywhere now. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:50.480]   All right, let's take a break. We're going to come back with more great panel Matthew Ingrid.
[00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:53.040]   By the way, we already determined before the show, nobody here has glass.
[00:25:53.040 --> 00:25:57.760]   Oh, okay. But next week I'll have it on Wednesday. You're getting... You got your invite.
[00:25:58.640 --> 00:26:04.720]   I did. I got my invite. I'm very, very excited. I'm going to go to Google LA this weekend.
[00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:09.200]   So, yeah, you decided you have the choice, right? They'll mail it to you, but you can also get
[00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:13.440]   it fitted and get trained. Exactly. Yeah. They'll mail it to you. They start shipping today on me
[00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:17.840]   first. But they strongly encourage you to come to the office. And I guess it's a fitting, which
[00:26:17.840 --> 00:26:22.480]   takes about 30 minutes, which sounds long to me. But then there's a tour. They take you on like an
[00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:29.040]   hour long tour of using glass. Oh, yeah. I'm super. I'm really excited. I know.
[00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:33.440]   Super cool. I know. It's dorky. I'm really excited though. Super cool. Are you going to wear it in the
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:40.800]   shower? I am not going to wear it in the shower. No. Okay. So let's get it out of the way.
[00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:48.480]   Robert Skowell, who has... This is... There's a precedent. He did this before to publicize his
[00:26:48.480 --> 00:26:54.800]   book with the shell, Israel. He and Shell were together in the shower naked. That was even more
[00:26:54.800 --> 00:27:00.320]   unappealing. Disturbing. Yeah. I reaction this picture is very simple. Don't look down.
[00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:07.120]   That's a kind of piece. Did you see that Scoble and Andrew Keene were kind of having at it at,
[00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:12.640]   I think it was the next web's conference. They were having a sort of confrontational discussion
[00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:16.000]   where Andrew Keene was basically like, are you going to know where that in the public bathroom?
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.720]   Like, I'm not going to stand next to you at a urinal if you're wearing those things that you're having.
[00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:22.800]   Scoble and his reviews say he went into something like four different mensmurems with the class.
[00:27:22.800 --> 00:27:27.040]   He said he didn't like 20 minutes. Scoble wrote a very, very good Google post,
[00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:31.440]   Google+ post only about a half an hour ago in which he just, you know, in Robert length,
[00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:36.240]   but he just said, come on, folks. You know, of course I'm not going to do that. You know,
[00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:41.200]   you're just going... The privacy people are going overboard preemptively and I'm glad he was fighting
[00:27:41.200 --> 00:27:46.000]   the fight. Yeah, I mean, I have to say, like it seemed like, you know, he was saying like,
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:51.120]   they're not on all the time. I'm not recording at all times. I mean, I think there are new social
[00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:54.560]   norms that have to get formed around this. He said someone suggested putting the glasses kind
[00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:59.360]   of on top of his head when you're in the bathroom, which would be sort of a way to sort of signify
[00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:03.200]   like, hey, I'm not, I'm not recording. He also said, you know, I don't look down men don't look down.
[00:28:03.200 --> 00:28:07.360]   It's like man code, right? I mean, you just don't do that, right? And that's something
[00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:11.200]   there's no laws about that. There's no, you know, signs. You just know not to do that. And he's saying,
[00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:17.680]   like, this is... Yeah, no talking, I don't know. But that's presuming that whoever's wearing these
[00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:22.080]   creepy glasses in the men's room is going to adhere to these
[00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:26.480]   lilyrays. And I don't think that there's any reason to assume that.
[00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:31.680]   Have you ever been in a men's room where somebody had a their cell phone out? I mean, did
[00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:36.720]   you guys not take this? So how do you know they're not taking a picture? I've seen guys talking on this,
[00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:41.840]   this is a far more disgusting. I've seen guys talking on the phone while wheezing. I saw a guy
[00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:47.280]   doing that. And then he dropped his phone into the urinal and screamed and everybody in the room
[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:56.080]   applauded. I could you not? Everybody went, yeah. I think guys pitched me on a story at a urinal.
[00:28:56.080 --> 00:29:01.040]   That is Google glasses is way better than that. Yeah, cuz at least with glasses.
[00:29:01.840 --> 00:29:07.120]   Effin done in our chatroom says there's no legal right to privacy in a public restroom. That cannot be true.
[00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:11.920]   No, no, that's not because if you have cameras, not it's wrong. It's not a public restroom.
[00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:16.080]   Cameras, you know, perves have put cameras and public restrooms have gotten arrested for it.
[00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:20.640]   No, that's not the case. There's a presumption of privacy there. But the point is, yeah,
[00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:24.000]   a little LED light is going to guarantee you it's going to be put on the glass in the next
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:30.320]   version. So people will know it's recording or not. A, but B, I got to disagree that this idea of,
[00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:36.000]   if it can go wrong, then with one, there's one bozo, one ass in the world who might do this,
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:40.880]   that oh my God, the thing is ruined. Well, that's true of a lot of life, cars,
[00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:46.000]   phones on camera. I guess you're right. I guess you're right. Lots and lots of things. You got to have
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:50.480]   some faith in society that we figure this out. We cope with norms and we do it. And that's the
[00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:55.040]   problem is that even before anybody has that in classes, some of these people are screaming
[00:29:55.040 --> 00:30:00.080]   what he murder about it. And it's, it's, it's, it's, remember when talking about yourself,
[00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:03.760]   what I considered really rude. Do you remember that? Yeah, now everybody talks
[00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:06.000]   ring up on. Yeah, that was just the height of reading.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:13.200]   Well, I haven't seen some of the videos coming out through glass and they're just like, they make
[00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:17.200]   you kind of, they make me like a little bit, a little bit nauseous. Like I published a video of
[00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:21.840]   he like dunking a basketball wearing glass, which was really cool. But it was also just like, oh,
[00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:27.520]   I feel a little sick because it's just like Blair Witch wearing glass. You're never going to nod
[00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:38.080]   again. Yeah. If you're recording. Yeah. I watched the one even in the demo of the guy with, I think
[00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:43.040]   it was his son and he was going around in a circle and I had the same feeling as you, Gina. I can't
[00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:48.400]   even watch, you know, movie handheld, handicapped movies where they go around in circles. Just make
[00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:52.480]   it doesn't make great video. The sound, if you're more than two feet away, the sound is bad.
[00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:57.120]   Somebody went Mashable or I think was Mashable went on today show. Oh, here's Matt. Yeah,
[00:30:57.120 --> 00:31:03.040]   Lance, you're on off. Yeah. Yeah. And I went. I'm just annoyed by all the journalists who've got it.
[00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:08.640]   You know, the videos and I didn't. It's not a game. It's me. But one thing that there's a
[00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:12.400]   breath. There's a rally, Horwitz piece is really good. We're he where he speculates about a lot
[00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:18.560]   of possible uses. Like we could look at the Eiffel Tower and see others virtual graffiti on it or
[00:31:18.560 --> 00:31:22.880]   things like that. And he said, imagine if you're in a crowd and suddenly there's a whole bunch of
[00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:27.680]   glass there and people, everybody turns at the same time, then you're going to believe there's
[00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:32.960]   something going on there where you're looking. Well, yeah, that same thing. If somebody, everybody
[00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:36.320]   turns their head at the same time. That's we're looking at if you're watching the video at Tim
[00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:42.480]   Stevens of Engadget doing his review. He we're going to have is Tim going for sure on Twitter?
[00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:47.040]   Yeah, we're going to have Tim and Scoble on Twitter on Sunday, presumably both wearing their
[00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:53.360]   glass. You're going to be a glass vest. I'm going to be so jealous. I have to admit, you know, when I
[00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:58.720]   was in Italy looking at things, I wish if I had had something that would pop up a little, you know,
[00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:04.240]   Wikipedia entry or something, something to tell me, even just a tiny bit of history about something,
[00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:08.160]   that would be worth it. That's field trip. I'm surprised they haven't ported field trip to glass.
[00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:12.880]   That seems like what field trip was invented. Oh, yeah, that's a no brainer. That's definitely
[00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:19.120]   going to happen. Yeah, for sure. I think still photos is a will be maybe a better use. I don't
[00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:25.760]   think that this set a lot of moving videos. Great. I mean, I want to go I want to go like
[00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:32.240]   paragliding first thing and wear glasses. You know, it's really fun. I can't stand heights as
[00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:38.960]   you know, bridges and heights. Oh, yeah. It's related. Yeah, really. Same thing.
[00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:42.880]   I was at a party the night and the only few times I've seen people in class,
[00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:48.000]   it's people have to wear them in addition to their eyelasses. That's what I'm worried about.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:51.280]   You and I have glasses. What are we going to do, Jeff? It's a real problem. And by the way,
[00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:54.960]   that your little fix for the men's room, you're going to miss the oracle with your glasses.
[00:32:54.960 --> 00:33:01.280]   So Scoble had removed glass, but had his glasses on underneath. Is that how it works now? Do you put
[00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:07.360]   glass? You put glass over? I think that's going to be dorky. That's as bad as really really
[00:33:07.360 --> 00:33:10.880]   a glass. They should have thought of this. There's too many young people at Google who don't have
[00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:17.840]   bad eyes yet. Yeah. Yeah, well, yeah. It's that's actually really good example of you work on
[00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:24.000]   comes with laser treatment. I don't I don't wear contacts. Yeah, I can wear my contacts, but I still
[00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:32.080]   anyway, whatever. Now, now I can't talk about glass because I'm gonna sound like I'm jealous
[00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:39.440]   because I am. We got to get Leo his. That's all right. It's okay. I don't care. There was a rumor
[00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:44.960]   they were working with Warby Parker on on Warby version, right, which would have, you know,
[00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:49.440]   your your prescription lenses in it. They do it looks like they come with sunglasses, right?
[00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:53.760]   There's come with a pop in sunglasses. Yeah, I'm going to go to my last guy and say how
[00:33:53.760 --> 00:34:00.560]   ridiculous is the price to make lenses that will fit on? Wow, you are dedicated. Well,
[00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:05.760]   I think it's going to be ridiculous. My wife will shoot me. You definitely are. You're dedicated.
[00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:10.480]   Well, film it when she shoots you. All right, we're going to take a break. Come back. We got the
[00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:16.400]   well, you know, that's by the way, where the scoble and the shower came from is not from glass.
[00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:19.360]   He was I don't think he was looking at mirror. I think his wife, Maryam, took that picture. He
[00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:26.000]   wants his her photo credit to summary. Yes. Yeah. So blame his wife. There's also a picture while
[00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:29.920]   you got there. It's on the rundown. There's a picture of him in the shower. The next one down
[00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:35.360]   is him with the warm afterglow, right? Oh, dear. I don't know if I want to.
[00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:40.960]   It's unfortunate. That's in a robe. And then the next picture down on the rundown is when you
[00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:46.960]   want to show. Really? Yeah, you do. If you're not, you're not. It's okay. It's okay. I'm really
[00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:50.560]   doing the strength. It's the new goat. See, we decided on Sunday that this is the new
[00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:55.040]   goat. See is Robert in the shower. Oh, there's Maryam not in the shower.
[00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:59.680]   There you go. Nice. It's not Maryam. Who is that? And somebody else?
[00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:01.520]   Looks like it's one of the glass.
[00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:05.280]   Oh, saying those are going to wear your glass in the shower. Make sure you bring an umbrella.
[00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:10.240]   Oh, she's one of the marketing, glass marketing folks at Google.
[00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:19.840]   Really? Oh, okay. That's cool. So I don't know. I'm just, you know, I don't know. I'm just,
[00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:23.760]   we'll see. I think you have, I think last, as I said last week is one of those things you have
[00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:29.040]   to use to understand. So I'm just going to reserve judgment. Like a pixel. You got to use it for
[00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:34.800]   one. No, I use the pixel on my understanding. I'm afraid I do understand it. Yeah.
[00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:39.760]   All right. We're going to come back with a change log, Gina. Prepare your trumpets.
[00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:43.840]   Got it. Get the trumpets oiled up. I'm sure ready.
[00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:51.840]   Empty this pit valve. Our show today brought to you by hover.com. Hover is the way to do domain
[00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:57.280]   registration. As soon as hover came out, and this is a creation of two cows, they've been doing a
[00:35:57.280 --> 00:36:00.960]   domain registration for a long time, but they said, we're going to make it clean. We're going to make
[00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:05.680]   it modern. We're going to make it simple. So they created hover.com as kind of the new,
[00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:11.680]   the modern way to register a domain name. Great management tools. They do not sell hosting.
[00:36:11.680 --> 00:36:18.480]   Really, it's a domain name register. If you go to our website, which is hover.com/twig,
[00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:22.560]   you can get 10% off your first domain registration. If you haven't used them, you might want to just
[00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:29.440]   try it. I moved, I use their concierge service to move everything over to cover.com automatically.
[00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:33.360]   Why would you want to register a domain name? Well, it's more professional. Certainly,
[00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:37.920]   if you have a website for your business, it should be yourbusiness.com. Or if you can't get
[00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:41.920]   dot com, nowadays, a lot of people can't dot net is a very good choice. Hover has that.
[00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:50.640]   They also have dot org dot TV dot pro dot mobi dot biz dot c a dot asia dot us dot uk. They have a
[00:36:50.640 --> 00:36:56.000]   lot of top level domains, those are called. But I think dot net is a very I have leola port.net.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:02.960]   Somebody has leola port.com domain started $15. And by the way, that includes who is privacy. Most
[00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:06.160]   the other guys will charge you they'll upsell you. In fact, that's one of the problems I have
[00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:10.640]   with all of those other guys is you can't get out of there. You can't get to your check out
[00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:13.760]   without clicking 100 different boxes saying, no, I don't want that. No, I don't want that. No,
[00:37:13.760 --> 00:37:18.000]   I don't want that. You do want who is privacy. That means they can't use your who is record to
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:23.120]   look up your home address, your home phone number, or your business address or phone number, who is
[00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:29.040]   privacy is automatic with each and every hover domain. It's great for setting up email. I really
[00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:34.720]   like that. In fact, I think that's something everybody should do is have their own domain name and have
[00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:40.480]   their email forwarded to it and then use it to forward it to a mail server. So you could still use
[00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:44.800]   Gmail or Yahoo or whoever you want to use, but you don't expose that address to the public. So if
[00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:50.400]   you decide to move on, no problem, your address does not change. Great for a permanent email address.
[00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:55.360]   I think lots of ways you could use hover.com. Why don't you try it right now? Their concierge
[00:37:55.360 --> 00:38:01.440]   service is very affordable. I think $25 for all your domains. They'll charge you $10 for a new domain
[00:38:01.440 --> 00:38:08.720]   or transfer, but that gives you a whole year of the domain renewal. So that's a good deal as well.
[00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:17.280]   Hover.com/twig is our special address for 10% off or use the offer code TWIG. And one of the
[00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:22.000]   things I really like, they have great customer service. Their customer service reps are empowered
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:27.120]   to help you. And that's why they won't put you on hold. They won't transfer you. When you call
[00:38:27.120 --> 00:38:31.920]   during business hours, you'll get a live rep and you will get your problem resolved. It's just
[00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:37.040]   great simplified domain name management. If you're registering domain names, I invite you to consider
[00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:44.960]   hover from now on. I moved all my stuff over there. Really great. Hover.com/twig for 10% off your first
[00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:54.080]   new domain names. It is time, ladies and gentlemen, for Gita Trapani and our Google change log.
[00:38:54.080 --> 00:39:08.640]   What's new at Google? Big launch this week was Google now for iOS. You guys see this? Yeah, it's
[00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:14.240]   not quite as functional as the one for Android. It actually comes packaged with the Google search
[00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:19.760]   app for iOS or iPhone and iPad. But it includes things like traffic updates based on your calendar
[00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:25.120]   or sport scores based on your location. It seems to have the same cards for me that I could get on
[00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:29.520]   my Android device. It does. It does. What's missing certain things like nearby events,
[00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:35.120]   activity, summary, the boarding passes. I don't think that it has quite the hooks into your Gmail
[00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:41.200]   account that maybe now for Android does. But nice to see it. And you also have to launch the
[00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:45.840]   Google search app in order to see your cards versus launch it from the home screen the way we can on
[00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:53.680]   Android. Still love to see Google now launching to other platforms. I saw a couple Android blogs
[00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:58.240]   saying, "Google now should have stayed Android only. It's a differentiating feature." Agwash,
[00:39:58.240 --> 00:40:03.200]   I say. Love to see Google now on iOS. I'd love to see it in Chrome too. Hopefully it'll come to Chrome
[00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:10.560]   as well. "Hogwash," says Gina. "Hogwash." That's Gina's imitation of Devoraka.
[00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:14.640]   It's a nasty. "Hogwash." "Hogwash."
[00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:23.040]   What else? Oh, so Google Web Fonts, well, Google Fonts, which was formerly Google Web Fonts,
[00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:29.360]   is now available for desktop use. Starting today, you can download Google Fonts for offline access
[00:40:29.360 --> 00:40:34.240]   on your desktop. There's a tool. You have to download a tool from Monotype that basically downloads
[00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:38.640]   the fonts and syncs them to your desktop. So this kind of runs in the background on your windows
[00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:44.960]   or Mac device. Just let's you use Google Fonts in offline and your desktop applications as well.
[00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:49.360]   Yeah, I really like Google Fonts. I use them on my website. But more than 300 fonts, right?
[00:40:49.360 --> 00:40:55.040]   Yeah. While you're there, I got a question. Being that I live,
[00:40:55.040 --> 00:41:01.200]   LaVita Google, and I had a whole big university document I had in print out this week. So I had it
[00:41:01.200 --> 00:41:06.160]   home. I had it all formatted and everything else. I had it on my pixel. Then when I switched over to
[00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:13.280]   a Mac because it was hooked up with the printer, then I already configured. Still in Google Docs,
[00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:16.800]   the formatting changed. Is that because it uses the local fonts?
[00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:21.680]   The formatting or the typography? The typography specifically? Like the fonts were different?
[00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:26.320]   Spacey. Page breaks were often things like that because it was still times do Roman on both,
[00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:28.880]   same 12 on both. But it was different.
[00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:33.680]   And this was a Google Doc inside your browser? Very strange.
[00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:38.320]   Google Doc inside the browser. So it was like it was using, I couldn't figure out why, but it
[00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:42.640]   doesn't use local fonts, right? It uses Google Fonts. Yeah. Yeah, that should use Google Fonts.
[00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:45.840]   And that doesn't sound like a font. It doesn't sound like a typography issue. It just sounds like a
[00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:52.640]   like spin line spacing or, you know, page break issue. I'm not sure. Yeah, I mean, if it was a
[00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:56.880]   local document, were you using like different versions of Word, I would say, oh well, it just
[00:41:56.880 --> 00:42:04.080]   interpreted the file. What's that you ask? Well, use what? What is the name for a product?
[00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:06.960]   We need a Ricky Martin live in Levita Google theme for you.
[00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:14.720]   I know I'm something on that one. I don't know. I don't know what happened. Sorry about that,
[00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:19.520]   Joe. No, no, no, I was just thought it was an odd way to understand how Docs worked. That's all.
[00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:24.160]   It was fun. Yeah. Yeah. It looks like there's over 600 of these Google fonts. Wow.
[00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:28.400]   It's quite a fit. They've expanded it quite a bit. Is it just the monotype fonts I can get,
[00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:36.080]   or can I get them or are they? I believe it. There's a monotype is doing this downloader, right?
[00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:41.040]   Yeah, monotype is doing the downloader. And no, they're the Google Fonts. So they actually,
[00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:46.000]   yeah, they teamed up with monotype to offer. And using the tool I downloaded earlier,
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   you can you can sign a monotype and get their fonts or the Google fonts are just free.
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:53.600]   Right there. That's a really great deal. Yeah. It's really nice.
[00:42:53.600 --> 00:42:58.560]   Grumpy Wizard. What is this? Is this the new the quick angry Fox jumps over the lazy dog?
[00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:04.240]   Grumpy Wizards make toxic brew for the evil queen and Jack. Yes. Oh, that's that's way better.
[00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:10.640]   It's a new quick brown Fox jump. I like it. Yeah. Grumpy Wizards make toxic brew for the evil
[00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:17.200]   queen and Jack. Did you say angry Fox? Yeah, well, he did. It's the quick browns. Brown is brown,
[00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:21.280]   not angry. Yeah, I'm angry. He jumps over the lazy. I'm still angry over that.
[00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:24.720]   Angry about glass. I'm glass glass.
[00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:33.200]   Glass angry. Google also this week launched a new Chrome extension. Actually, this this might have
[00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:38.320]   been related to your problem, Jeff. There's a new Chrome office viewer Chrome extension that
[00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:44.080]   renders word Excel and PowerPoint files directly in your browser. Right. So right now, if you open up
[00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:50.480]   a word Excel PowerPoint file, it'll open in a drive based viewer, but you can install this
[00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:54.480]   Chrome office viewer, which is which is still in beta and you actually have to be running the
[00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:58.320]   Chrome beta or beyond a Chromebook. This is actually, I guess, by the fall, installed on
[00:43:58.320 --> 00:44:02.640]   Chromebooks right now. Actually, you wouldn't let me install it before. Oh, it wouldn't let you
[00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:07.280]   install it on your desktop or your Chromebook. My Chromebook. You want to name it again?
[00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:09.360]   Chrome office viewer.
[00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:20.400]   It said I couldn't do it on this machine, but I then switched to the beta version of Chrome.
[00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:25.440]   Maybe that was wrong. So Google says this. Oh, there we go.
[00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:28.640]   Oh, the TPS report. That's nice.
[00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:36.240]   Yes. Little, little tip of the hat to office space. Yeah, little mic judge gone on there like that.
[00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:43.040]   So Google says the advantage to using this plugin overdrive is that it will help protect you against
[00:44:43.040 --> 00:44:49.440]   malware because the files open up and kind of a specialized sandbox. And they say, quote,
[00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:53.920]   to impede attackers use compromised office files to try to steal private information or monitor
[00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:58.400]   your activities, which is kind of funny. There there's I feel like that's an underhanded
[00:44:58.400 --> 00:45:02.960]   accusation of Microsoft for trying to do that. Not even so not even underhanded.
[00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:11.280]   Nothing underhanded about that. So speaking of Google Drive, the
[00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:16.960]   classification of everything continues into drive. I'm actually not seeing this change in our
[00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:22.800]   twig rundown document, but I saw it this morning at another dock. You'll see now there's a side.
[00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:28.080]   There's a sidebar chat on Google Docs. Well, those are now tied to your Google Plus account.
[00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:33.040]   So you'll see your Google Plus icons. And if you mouse over the icon, you can follow someone
[00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:37.520]   or add somebody your circles. This is right inside Drive. You can start a group chat kind of like
[00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:41.120]   what we do the group chat in the sidebar now, but it's just a little bit a little bit more
[00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:48.000]   plusified. Is this a touch of wave? Is it attached to wave? A touch of wave. A touch of wave.
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:52.640]   So wave, yeah, a little bit. It kind of is. It's kind of like it is. It's kind of like drives,
[00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:58.160]   you know, updates as you as you type, which is very wave-like. And now it's got Google Plus users
[00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:03.440]   in there, which so you can add to your circles and you can start a chat. So yeah, it is kind of
[00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:09.600]   wavy because it's that that chat while you co collaborate on a document. And there's a new
[00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:14.800]   new look for anonymous users. This is interesting. Anonymous users will get a random like animal
[00:46:14.800 --> 00:46:22.320]   icon. You can see it. The tip of the hat to O'Reilly there. Yeah, it does. It looks that way, right?
[00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:28.560]   Is there a torsier in there? No, but I've got the if you look at my screen chat, I think I have the
[00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:34.880]   maybe we could use this one, the quick brown fox jumping over a lazy dog here. Let me just
[00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:40.320]   talk is great. Wait a minute. No, there's a picture. He's where's the motion? Where's the video?
[00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:44.080]   It's supposed to move off. Yeah, you got it. There we go.
[00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:50.320]   Daily. Oh, there we go. There we go. There we go. Here it is. Here's gonna. This is a quick
[00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:56.080]   fox. He's going to ease. No, can't quite do it. Let me try again, Fox. Try one more time. There's
[00:46:56.080 --> 00:46:59.920]   that lazy dog. Do you think they trained him to do this? There we go.
[00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:11.040]   I did it and I'm done. Did it and I'm out. Yeah. Sorry. I mean, they're erupt. No, no, that's
[00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:16.640]   okay. That's okay. Last change log item. Google has announced that app activities are coming to
[00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:20.720]   search. So a couple of weeks ago, we and I actually think we had a couple of Googlers on to talk about
[00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:27.440]   this that Google had opened up Google sign in for apps. So like if you're using Fandango, for example,
[00:47:27.440 --> 00:47:32.000]   on your phone, you can sign in with your Google+ account. Well, Google really wants developers to
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:36.160]   use those services because then Google could collect information about usage on apps. And
[00:47:36.160 --> 00:47:41.920]   then they're going to show stats about that usage in in their search search results. So if you so
[00:47:41.920 --> 00:47:46.320]   soon this hasn't rolled out yet. But if you search for a site or an app on google.com and that app
[00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:50.720]   has integrated with Google+ sign in, you'll see popular and aggregate user activity and the right
[00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:56.160]   of the search results in that knowledge graph area. So if you search for say Fandango, for example,
[00:47:56.160 --> 00:48:01.600]   you'll see the top movies among Google users. Oh, neat. Yeah. So they're rolling out this feature
[00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:05.440]   in desktop search. The next over the next couple of weeks, they're starting with limited number of
[00:48:05.440 --> 00:48:12.560]   music and movie apps. So Deezer, Fandango, Flixter, Slacker Radio, Songza, SoundCloud, TuneIn,
[00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:17.920]   but they're going to be adding more apps over time as more apps integrate this. My guess is
[00:48:17.920 --> 00:48:22.160]   that at Google I/O, they're going to be pushing this hard on developers because they want developers
[00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:25.440]   to be using this sign in because this makes search results better. Yeah, there's I looked at the
[00:48:25.440 --> 00:48:30.960]   schedule for Google I/O. There's lots and lots of sign in sessions. Schedules up, I put it on the
[00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:43.360]   rundown. Oh, cool. Yeah. Yeah. That's all I got for the change log.
[00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:44.880]   That's my signal to you, Chad. Now I just do this and you're supposed to know that's the
[00:48:44.880 --> 00:48:52.560]   Dimpany. Dum, dum, dum. Yeah, makes sense. Google, you know, it's a very clear strategy with Google+
[00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:59.120]   and the Google sign in collecting signals. And the more the better. Yeah. It degraded one experience,
[00:48:59.120 --> 00:49:03.360]   all tied back into your Google+ profile, right? One man's creepy,
[00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:07.440]   scruggling is another man's collecting signals. That's all there is to it.
[00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:16.560]   COMEX, fired at Apple, working for Google. Who is Super Hacker COMEX? Let's ask our own
[00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:23.760]   Super Hacker, Gina. Who is COMEX? I don't know. I just know the story. He's the guy who first,
[00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:28.560]   I think was first rooted the iPhone. Oh, I heard him as an intern with a college kid.
[00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:32.080]   Apple hired us an intern, but evidently he didn't respond to an email in time and they
[00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:38.240]   asked his intern. Google said, come here. He wrote jailbreak me with the hacking tools for iPhone
[00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:44.640]   and iPad. Nicholas Allegra is his real name. He's not going to be on Android. He doesn't like
[00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:51.520]   Android. That's funny. Did he say that? He was so, yeah. I never liked it enough to have on a
[00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:58.080]   hack it, he said. That's awesome. Or you could say it doesn't really need to be hacked, but okay.
[00:49:58.080 --> 00:50:08.320]   Apparently he's got a promising future. Yeah. I mean, people were amazed that when jailbreak
[00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:14.720]   3 was released, apparently, according to Forbes, the information security community was baffled
[00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:19.040]   that a teenager had single-handedly unlocked the most tightly restricted consumer operating
[00:50:19.040 --> 00:50:25.360]   system in the world. Charlie Miller, who's famous for hacking Apple, said he was totally blown away.
[00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:33.040]   Apple, this is all this copy is hysterical. Fellow Apple hacker Dino Diodzova later commented to
[00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:39.520]   another reporter. Allegra seemed to be from the future. Within two months, he was given an
[00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:44.800]   internship at Apple, but a year later, he was suddenly let go for failing to respond to an email
[00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:49.920]   that would have extended his employment. I love that. He didn't respond to an email.
[00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:53.760]   I'm busy. I'm busy. I'm busy. Would you like to keep your job?
[00:50:53.760 --> 00:50:58.880]   So now he's interning at Google. I wonder if he's doing some of our code stuff or
[00:50:58.880 --> 00:51:07.840]   is he checking his email more regularly? I don't think it's that's it's just bizarre that they'd
[00:51:07.840 --> 00:51:10.880]   fire it because you didn't answer to your email. Well, I guess they're saying, would you like to
[00:51:10.880 --> 00:51:16.400]   stick around and he didn't respond? That'd be very apt to me. Maybe you don't care enough
[00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:21.040]   to do the Apple thing. Well, that's a funny question because I recently sent an email to one
[00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:26.800]   of our employees with exactly the same question. And you know what? Seriously, this person did not
[00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:32.480]   respond. So what do I do? Tell them to go work at Google. This is this is my favorite part of this
[00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:38.800]   war story. He said after the mis-deadline the offer this was to intern or to be employed at
[00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:42.960]   Apple was permanently rescinded. And this is this is a quote. I wasn't too happy about it, but it
[00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:48.480]   didn't seem like I was able to fix it. He told me at the time. So so this kid can jailbreak
[00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:54.160]   iPhones and iPads, but he doesn't have the the social skills or the maturity to be able to go to
[00:51:54.160 --> 00:52:00.640]   a person to employing him. And get them to change his mind and be able to apologize for a missing email.
[00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:06.400]   Like so there we go. I mean, I have great respect for his technical chops, but that's pretty typical
[00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:10.560]   though, Gina. Isn't it? It is very typical. But it's just interesting that he said I wasn't able to
[00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:14.800]   fix it like as if it were a bug in the system. Right. Let him go because he missed an email that
[00:52:14.800 --> 00:52:19.760]   he was not able to fix. I found a trouble ticket, but I just we couldn't figure it out. Was it won't
[00:52:19.760 --> 00:52:27.920]   fix? Won't fix. I couldn't read the Apple management structure. I don't understand it. It's so so
[00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:33.360]   if you're if your employee person Leo came to you and said, look, I'm really sorry. I missed your email.
[00:52:33.360 --> 00:52:41.200]   I had a good fix it. You would fix it. Yeah. Oh, sorry. But he is an intern interns. That's different.
[00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:45.840]   And it turns it. It turns it. It turns it. It goes well. And wouldn't someone have said,
[00:52:45.840 --> 00:52:49.760]   let's try a little harder than sending an email? Well, you got to think now that there's an article
[00:52:49.760 --> 00:52:54.960]   about it in Forbes that somebody at Apple knows about it. You think they would pick up the phone
[00:52:54.960 --> 00:52:59.600]   if they wanted to employ him? Go buy his office, baby. I don't. Well, they have a lot of there's
[00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:04.400]   a lot of interns. You saw the movie? It's a busy actually we have what happened to that movie.
[00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:10.640]   The one with the where Vince won intern. That was the Google the Google they went to Google to
[00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:15.120]   intern not Apple. Well, but whatever happened to that movie? Oh, I think it must have been so
[00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:23.360]   bad they never released it. Let's Google it directly to the Internet. It's in a it's in a bin somewhere
[00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:27.680]   where the Ashton Kutcher Steve Jobs movie just waiting to be released someday.
[00:53:28.560 --> 00:53:31.600]   Is that isn't that gonna get released at some point?
[00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:35.520]   They showed it at a film festival. It's Sundance, I think.
[00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:38.080]   It's final mysteriously disappeared.
[00:53:38.080 --> 00:53:46.400]   June 7th, it comes out. Okay. We haven't missed it. Not this not the Ashton Kutcher the the
[00:53:46.400 --> 00:53:52.800]   Vince Vaughn. I would love to that would be a twig field trip. Should we do a field trip and
[00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:59.200]   go watch it somewhere? I'll go watch it. What's it called? Is it the interns? Something like that.
[00:53:59.200 --> 00:54:05.200]   Looking for it internship internship. The internship. Let's all go watch it with glass and then post
[00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:12.320]   our videos or shaky head videos on the Internet. How about that? Hang out. Yeah. Yeah. And then
[00:54:12.320 --> 00:54:15.440]   share it on Google Drive so everyone else can watch our experience.
[00:54:17.040 --> 00:54:22.480]   They have a hangout. There it is. The internship. 2013 Owen Wilson, Vince Vaughn.
[00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:27.760]   Oh, they're rocking the John Goodman. The type of photography and the colors.
[00:54:27.760 --> 00:54:34.880]   Yeah. Wow. That's the from the trailer. It's gonna be God awful. Seriously.
[00:54:34.880 --> 00:54:44.320]   Get ready. No tomatoes at all. So Google. Last year hired Ray Kurzweil, another person.
[00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:53.680]   Apparently he got the email and responded to it. I guess yesterday he moderated a live
[00:54:53.680 --> 00:55:03.120]   Google hangout that was tied to the Will Smith movie after Earth. I think that was a week ago
[00:55:03.120 --> 00:55:11.520]   yesterday, actually. So he talked a little bit to Wired magazine about the movie,
[00:55:12.640 --> 00:55:20.640]   but also about predicting the future and they asked him. He said, you predicted search engines.
[00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:25.600]   Yes, I wrote about that in the 1980s. But did you predict you'd be working for Google?
[00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:29.280]   Well, that's the kind of thing you can't predict.
[00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:36.160]   What are you working on at Google? My mission at Google developed natural language understanding
[00:55:36.160 --> 00:55:41.760]   in collaboration with other researchers at Google. Search has moved beyond finding keywords.
[00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:45.760]   It still doesn't read all those billion of web pages and book pages for semantic content.
[00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:52.800]   So it's more than just indexing, right? It's understanding. And when that happens, we'll have
[00:55:52.800 --> 00:56:00.640]   Skynet. If your system really understood complex natural language, would you argue that it's conscious?
[00:56:00.640 --> 00:56:07.840]   Yes, says Ray Kurzweil. He said, I have a consistent date of 2029 for that vision.
[00:56:07.840 --> 00:56:12.160]   So he's working towards a singularity. And where better to do that than Google?
[00:56:12.160 --> 00:56:19.360]   But it's interesting. He's not just talking about it being smart. He says, this means emotional
[00:56:19.360 --> 00:56:26.560]   intelligence being funny, being sexy. Wait a minute, being funny. I get being sexy.
[00:56:26.560 --> 00:56:33.840]   That's what he says. Hi, I'm Google. I'm here to give you a happy ending.
[00:56:34.400 --> 00:56:41.440]   I really want my search engine to seduce me. No, no, I don't. I'm afraid to look like Robert
[00:56:41.440 --> 00:56:46.480]   Scoble in the shower. That's the problem. That's right. You and I, Jeffrey, we were going there.
[00:56:46.480 --> 00:56:49.200]   Sorry. You were faster.
[00:56:49.200 --> 00:56:57.760]   Wow. I think if you're going to be sexy, being is a better shot at than Google.
[00:56:57.760 --> 00:57:02.000]   Just a better for that search engine with the woman. It was like an animated woman kind of
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:06.960]   standing there. I'm talking to you. Miss, what's her name? Miss Webster or something?
[00:57:06.960 --> 00:57:10.720]   Yeah, it was something like that. She did to me big time. You could find that on YouTube.
[00:57:10.720 --> 00:57:18.320]   When you search for my name, I don't know why. It was a experiment by Microsoft. It was not a,
[00:57:18.320 --> 00:57:26.160]   it was never an improvement on talking paperclip. Yeah. Yeah. Microsoft. Her name was Miss
[00:57:26.160 --> 00:57:31.680]   something. This is, this is Leo. I think you could probably find it, Chad, on YouTube.
[00:57:31.680 --> 00:57:37.680]   Because we did this on, I can't find it.
[00:57:37.680 --> 00:57:44.240]   Miss Cleo or no, Miss Dewey. That was it. Miss Dewey.
[00:57:44.240 --> 00:57:48.240]   Oh, yeah. That sounds right. Miss Dewey. Chatham to the rescue once again.
[00:57:48.240 --> 00:57:54.000]   There are so many great search results for Leer Laporte. This is, by the way.
[00:57:54.800 --> 00:57:59.200]   Yeah. Yeah. Here we go. I diss, we diss you all this. Here's Miss Dewey.
[00:57:59.200 --> 00:58:05.920]   Let me, there she is. There she is. Let me see if I could turn up the sound. I've got Windows 8.
[00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:10.400]   So as you might expect, it's a little bit difficult, but let me see. But you hold on to that machine.
[00:58:10.400 --> 00:58:15.280]   Well, no, I, you know what? I was going to replace it with a Mac, but then I think they're going to do
[00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:24.080]   new ones. Here's Miss Dewey. Oh, there's no sound. I mean, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:58:24.560 --> 00:58:28.880]   Oh, Lord. In this corner. Wait. This is not sexy. Okay. Let's find another.
[00:58:28.880 --> 00:58:36.560]   Here we go. Leer Laporte gets pwned by search engine. How about that?
[00:58:36.560 --> 00:58:40.880]   Because they are always trying to compete with Google in the future. Yeah, not in their own game.
[00:58:40.880 --> 00:58:46.640]   Exactly. They're trying to jump ahead of Google and see, you know, kind of come up with their own
[00:58:46.640 --> 00:58:51.680]   idea of what's the future will be. I just, you know, I know that sounds vain, but I know what
[00:58:51.680 --> 00:58:56.400]   search results should be for my own name. Exactly. Look at that. So she thinks for a while,
[00:58:56.400 --> 00:59:05.680]   for a little bit. And then there's a reason why they call the TV the idiot box. And I think I found it.
[00:59:05.680 --> 00:59:15.680]   Oh my God. You're kidding. That is horrible. Nice. Oh, okay. Well, I'm disrespected by a major
[00:59:15.680 --> 00:59:26.560]   corporation since 19 whatever, 93. Oh, that's awesome. It's a weird, weird response. Miss Dewey.
[00:59:26.560 --> 00:59:30.640]   Yeah, it was more about attitude, but that's what I'm thinking. If Ray Kurzweil gets to it,
[00:59:30.640 --> 00:59:35.920]   see, now it's making noise again. I'm going to turn down the noise maker. See, I installed a chat
[00:59:35.920 --> 00:59:40.160]   engine that is now telling me that you've, you've, people are chatting at me. What a surprise.
[00:59:40.160 --> 00:59:43.840]   Can you not turn that off? I'm sure I can, but I'm busy.
[00:59:43.840 --> 00:59:52.080]   Let's move along. Shall we do another story? What do you say?
[00:59:52.080 --> 00:59:58.240]   Let's do it. Oh, should we talk about IO? Just do something please, because I'm stuck in a,
[00:59:58.240 --> 01:00:05.360]   in Windows 8 L. I always in two weeks, by the way, I'm totally completely excited.
[01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:10.800]   Isn't that soon? Yes, it's very soon. It's, it's, it's, it's awesome. This schedule just got released
[01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:14.320]   and it looks like there's only going to be a single keynote on the first day.
[01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:17.040]   Oh, what time? Nine o'clock.
[01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:24.400]   What's like nine? Nine to 12. Oh, good lord. Okay. There will be a break, which I,
[01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:28.800]   I can't imagine that they're going to empty out that huge, that huge room to let people use the
[01:00:28.800 --> 01:00:32.560]   bathroom or whatever. I imagine it's just going to be a kind of stand up and stretch kind of break.
[01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:39.360]   We will be covering that live. Actually, it won't be we. It will be Tom Merritt and Crue,
[01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:45.360]   because Gina, Jeff and I will all three be at the keynote, only one of us will be wearing a
[01:00:45.360 --> 01:00:50.080]   Google glass. By that, you might have yours there. What about you? Didn't you get one, Jeff?
[01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:54.000]   Oh, but I got it. Yeah, you might have yours. In the kitty program. Well, so a lot of the people in
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:59.520]   the kitty program got it got it that way. Scoble got it that way. No, Scoble, Scoble was at IO.
[01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:04.400]   He was at IO? I think so. Didn't he have a low number in the, in the glass?
[01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:09.200]   They, I don't know. I have not scoble in it. I'm pretty sure he tweeted it.
[01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:16.320]   Anyway, you might get yours. I mean, actually it would be, it would be, you could might be able to
[01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:20.320]   pick them up while I want the picture, because it's going to look just like the picture from the
[01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:25.760]   50s of people with the red and green glasses. I want the picture of the entire keynote audience
[01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:29.840]   going like this with their Google glass. Yeah, because that's what it's going to look like.
[01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:34.560]   And it'll be just as historic in a few years. Remember when they did with the thing?
[01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:41.600]   Maybe not. Google's going to ask everyone to turn off their Y. Turn off your glass.
[01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:45.680]   Every single person in the room is going to have three devices on them, which connect to the Y.
[01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:54.320]   So one of the, one of the sessions at IO is how to avoid your warranty hacking your glass.
[01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:59.280]   Is it really? That's the name of the session? I love it. Yeah. Which means they're encouraging it.
[01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:02.400]   A2, which means they're encouraging it. That's great. Smart.
[01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:07.120]   A2 under the, the, the glass track. They should encourage hacking.
[01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:11.440]   You know, you have to click on more topics, I think, on that chart, you just had.
[01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:16.640]   Okay. That's all right. I believe you, Jeff. You're probably worse, better on a pixel.
[01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:20.160]   You bet it does. There is. He was, I already read it all.
[01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:23.680]   There's not a lot of, there's only a few, there's four glass seminars. I'm surprised.
[01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:28.480]   Hacking avoiding your warranty, hacking glass, building glass services with the Google Mirror
[01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:35.840]   API, fireside chat with the glass team. And then what does that say? Developing for glass.
[01:02:35.840 --> 01:02:40.720]   That's it. You'd think there'd be more given how many sessions there are. Glass is just not that.
[01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:45.280]   I mean, if you look, you know, I mean, look at Android, there should be a ton of sessions.
[01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:49.360]   There's Google plus. And then go to, go to plus, you'll see a lot of stuff as you said earlier.
[01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:52.960]   That's about using Google plus authentication. Yeah.
[01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:56.560]   Tiny, interesting. Yeah. Yeah. That makes sense. I mean, honestly, they could have folded glass
[01:02:56.560 --> 01:03:01.120]   into Android because, I mean, not a lot of people have it. I mean, it is Android. Not a lot of people
[01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:05.840]   have it yet. What do I do? I didn't know from that I found out from the Engadget review,
[01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:12.800]   as you showed briefly earlier, is that the glass is another device so that your phone doesn't hook
[01:03:12.800 --> 01:03:19.920]   up with Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, they said, your phone has to open up a, what is Wi-Fi, I guess,
[01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:27.600]   but it opens up a tethering session. And so, right? Well, you have to use tethering.
[01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:33.360]   You have to use tethering from your phone to the glass. And thus, the guy said he's paying
[01:03:33.360 --> 01:03:39.360]   another 20 bucks a month to be able to tether. Oh, that's interesting. I didn't realize that.
[01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:45.280]   I thought that that sucks. That really sucks. If you're tethering to your, oh, so you have to
[01:03:45.280 --> 01:03:50.000]   tether to your phone in order to access. Your phone has to be in hotspot mode? Well, it'll kill a
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:54.880]   battery fast. I can't believe that. That's not right. It's Bluetooth. Yeah, well, yeah, why would
[01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:59.920]   you do this? This is any Wi-Fi. This is also what Tim Stevens said in his review is that you need to
[01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:07.200]   use the Bluetooth done Internet thing. Oh, that's why it's Bluetooth is using done. Okay, that's
[01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:11.920]   different. That's not the same as turning on hotspotting. Well, it is to some, but it's using the Internet
[01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:17.360]   access. Yeah, that's the problem. Makes sense. Mobile accounts. I have an AT&T grandfather
[01:04:17.360 --> 01:04:21.760]   unlimited. And supposedly I'm not supposed to tether. Now, in fact, I can a little bit, but I don't
[01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:27.760]   want to do so much. I get caught and thrown into AT&T jail. So it's Bluetooth dial up networking.
[01:04:27.760 --> 01:04:32.960]   So it is Bluetooth connected, but it's Internet, but it has Internet access through Bluetooth.
[01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:37.120]   That makes sense. It'd have to do that. That's the only way it could do the Internet access.
[01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:44.640]   So that makes sense. That makes sense. I don't think it's actually in the rundown. They released
[01:04:44.640 --> 01:04:50.960]   it at how Glass works video. Actually, they didn't talk about it. Yeah, is it? Let's see. It's like,
[01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:55.120]   it's it's a minute long. We played it last night on Elle, but Android, but it kind of shows how the
[01:04:55.120 --> 01:05:00.880]   touchpad works and how the UI how you switch between cards in the UI and what the UI looks like.
[01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:04.800]   It basically looks like like a horizontal Google now. That's it. Yeah, there it is, Chad.
[01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:11.840]   Welcome to Glass. Here are the basics of how to use Glass.
[01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:19.520]   This is your touchpad. It runs from your temple to your ear. Tap the touchpad to wake up Glass.
[01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:25.600]   You should see the display above your line of sight. Adjust it to see everything.
[01:05:25.600 --> 01:05:34.240]   The home screen shows a clock. This is your timeline. It's a row of cards. Things to the left
[01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:36.800]   are happening now are coming up like the weather.
[01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:38.720]   Whoa, good scroll through it.
[01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:40.720]   Or even in your calendar. So that's Google now.
[01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:40.720]   So that's Google now.
[01:05:40.720 --> 01:05:43.040]   You can tap on any card. That's exactly now.
[01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:45.600]   Make sense. So type down anywhere to go back to the timeline.
[01:05:45.600 --> 01:05:54.160]   Cards to the right of the home screen are from the past. For example, messages, videos,
[01:05:54.160 --> 01:05:59.280]   or photos. Tap on a photo to share it and choose one of your friends.
[01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:08.160]   [Music]
[01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:12.400]   Swipe down to go back to standby and have fun exploring.
[01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:17.920]   Yeah, so we were talking about this last night all about Android. I was saying, like,
[01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:20.560]   oh, I didn't realize that there was going to be, there's so much motion. There's so much
[01:06:20.560 --> 01:06:24.320]   kind of temple rubbing. And then someone from Google tweeted at me and said, you can wake up
[01:06:24.320 --> 01:06:30.800]   glass by tilting your head and saying, okay, glass. So you don't have to be touching the touch pad.
[01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:34.640]   So you can sort of do it with head gestures as well.
[01:06:34.640 --> 01:06:39.600]   But yeah, I feel like that was more information than we really have gotten in a while about what
[01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:40.720]   the UI actually looks like.
[01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:47.280]   Do you watch a TV show called One Tree Hill? Gina?
[01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:49.920]   No, I haven't. I've heard of it.
[01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:55.280]   Stars, a woman named Sophia Bush, she's apparently dating Google's hottest hunk.
[01:06:55.280 --> 01:07:02.320]   According to Perez, I love the link for as Hilton. Coachella's hottest hitter, Ipster.
[01:07:02.320 --> 01:07:07.600]   Let me just read you the, I have, I've never read for as Hilton, but apparently it's a, well,
[01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:14.000]   Sophia Bush, she's the star of the TV show. Sophia Bush is betting down with a handsome new
[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:21.520]   hottie. And we love it. The sultry sexa, one tree, well, sexa, S-E-X-X-X-A-Y.
[01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:26.080]   One Tree Hill star recently went public with the latest love interest. And we have to admit,
[01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:31.680]   we are totes impressed. Google program manager Dan Friedenburg is a handsome smart.
[01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:38.640]   And he has a super steady, totally amaze balls job. Damn girl, we don't suppose he has a brother,
[01:07:38.640 --> 01:07:44.400]   balls. Holy moly. Getting today a mountain view.
[01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:51.360]   You know, working for Google is a little bit of a celebrity. There was an episode of V recently,
[01:07:51.360 --> 01:07:54.960]   where they said something like, oh, she showed up a little late. It's not like she has a job at
[01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:59.040]   Google or anything. Wow. And there's this like a big possession of like,
[01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:05.920]   street cred, a little rock star. That's pretty cool. Yes. You can't pay for that kind of,
[01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:10.960]   yeah. This this fellow does look like a hot hunk, Perez who held to worthy.
[01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:14.800]   I know. Really? No, I don't know. You're type. Yeah.
[01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:21.920]   31 year old program director Dan Friedenburg is a hunk, a licious.
[01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:30.320]   Girls, stand back. He's taken. He's wearing tomato colored pants. I don't know about that.
[01:08:30.320 --> 01:08:32.480]   Those are what this game looks like as Google was feed.
[01:08:34.320 --> 01:08:38.000]   Those are pink. Those aren't tomato. Oh, pink, even better skinny.
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:43.040]   There's skinny jeans and a tank top that says, stop the pity.
[01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:49.040]   I don't know what that means. Yeah, just look at those arm bands. They have been clubbing.
[01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:52.640]   No, no, they're a Coachella. That's what you need to. Oh, yeah. Okay. Sorry.
[01:08:52.640 --> 01:08:57.520]   The sweat band is completely gratuitous. That's just because he's such a hunk. He might sweat
[01:08:57.520 --> 01:09:01.920]   all over his arm. The sneakers are good. He's wearing Converse. Yeah.
[01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:05.920]   No, those are vans. They're vans. All right. That's fine. He's a skater.
[01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:09.680]   She's got a hole in her skirt. I guess you can't afford better, but that's okay.
[01:09:09.680 --> 01:09:11.840]   We are terrible. I'm not even kidding.
[01:09:11.840 --> 01:09:16.800]   Well, we're horrible people for reading, Perez Hill number one.
[01:09:16.800 --> 01:09:24.640]   I suppose we'll have a comment on our appearance so we can we can do it as well.
[01:09:24.640 --> 01:09:28.880]   But I just added Dan to my circles. He is on Google+. Oh, he's hunk a licious.
[01:09:28.880 --> 01:09:34.160]   Somebody comment there on anything that he says hooked up with a real
[01:09:34.160 --> 01:09:37.440]   the apparently they've been in relationship for six months according to Perez Hilton.
[01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:43.360]   No, there's the sure list photo of him doing a triathlon. He's quite the athlete, but.
[01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:45.920]   Oh, I just love it.
[01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:52.960]   Mark Andreessen says glass assisted surgery is in the future.
[01:09:54.400 --> 01:10:00.720]   Not my future for him. By the way, my son is having his appendix out right now, Jeff Jarvis.
[01:10:00.720 --> 01:10:06.400]   Oh, no. Is it emergency? Well, he had pain this morning and Jennifer brought him to the emergency
[01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:12.960]   room and oh, wow. Yeah. So yeah, are through a scopic. Isn't it laparoscopic or something nowadays?
[01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:18.640]   Yeah, I don't know. The recovery is not bad. Oh, wow. And you're here working. Aren't you?
[01:10:18.640 --> 01:10:23.280]   Well, I, you know, I'm getting urgent text messages throughout the show, but I'm good. They caught it.
[01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:30.640]   Yeah, it's good. They caught it and and yeah, not when it's not burst as mine was. It's
[01:10:30.640 --> 01:10:35.120]   yeah, they they wipe they did the blood test. He's no white blood cells. So it's not burst,
[01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:39.920]   but it's hurting. So they got rid of it are getting rid of it. Well, it's over. That's it.
[01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:44.720]   Well, it was almost exactly a year ago when I had mine. Yeah. Yeah. I used to use a, you know,
[01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:48.480]   because you're the, you know, I said, well, Jeff, Jeff was like on the show the next day. So
[01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:54.800]   I knew it was really okay. Give him more best. I shall.
[01:10:54.800 --> 01:11:02.400]   I shall. Glass has already been jailbroken. That's good. Was it the kid? Was it the kid who
[01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:09.680]   was a COMEX? No. No, it was not. It's an electric ship. Why on glass?
[01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:17.120]   Oh, this looks like it's Jay Freeman. It's yeah. Sorek.
[01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:23.520]   Sorek. He's wearing glass. City of guy. Now that's a guy should have glass. The city of guy.
[01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:30.480]   Absolutely. What did you do with a jailbroken glass? You can put other apps on it, right? So
[01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:38.480]   run apps directly on it. Yeah. Yeah. Glass, he says, runs Android 4.04 of all things,
[01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:45.120]   which is ice cream sandwich, right? It took me two hours while I was having dinner with friends
[01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:55.040]   of the time. Two hours while he was eating. I'm eating and hacking. I met Sorek and hung
[01:11:55.040 --> 01:11:59.600]   a little bit with him at food camp. He's a nice guy. He's obviously very smart hacker.
[01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:03.520]   Let's just say this. He's never going to be in Paris. Help. No.
[01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:13.040]   I think he's a good looking man. I date him. He's actually a lot of fun.
[01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:18.800]   Chartroom's going to go crazy. I can't resist. Geez, give me a break.
[01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:22.480]   I love. I mean, hey, anybody who says it took me two hours to jailbreak it while I was having
[01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:28.720]   dinner with friends is a winner in my book. Yeah. Yeah. He's got a good looking brain, that guy.
[01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:34.560]   He got it through the developer program. He says, I'm not sure what gaining root access
[01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:41.360]   might make possible. He can't use glass because he has, he wears glasses. So he says it makes
[01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:44.080]   focusing on the display painful for more than a few minutes at a time.
[01:12:44.080 --> 01:12:51.280]   The other problem I've heard from people is people, I didn't realize, people have contacts
[01:12:51.280 --> 01:12:56.640]   who are near and far as I did. One eye is near one eye as far. What does that mean for
[01:12:56.640 --> 01:13:01.840]   how you deal with glass? Yeah, I think I won't be able to wear it. And you know,
[01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:05.360]   given the, because that's exactly the description of my vision problem,
[01:13:05.360 --> 01:13:10.000]   given that so many people wear spectacles in this world, I don't know what the,
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:14.080]   yeah, I, yeah, I, well, again, this last time was this party from bird, the German publisher,
[01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:16.720]   and a guy there had everybody tried to want it. They just put him on over their glasses.
[01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:22.720]   You look doubly ridiculous, but what the heck? Well, I wonder if you put a lens in it,
[01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:27.920]   it'd have to be before you'd have to, I don't know. No, the problem is what's right, Leo. It's a cut
[01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:33.360]   out. Right. That's probably why they haven't done it yet. Can't change the focal length of
[01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:38.240]   focal length is evidently quite a bit out here, but you can't change that. Right.
[01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:43.520]   Got to just Danny Sullivan's got it, right? He says, because I compared glass to the,
[01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:47.600]   as you remember, to the segue, he says, no, it's not the segue. It's Gordon Gekko's cell phone.
[01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:50.080]   That's like, I think that's actually right.
[01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:51.520]   It's an app. Very apt.
[01:13:51.520 --> 01:13:56.800]   In the movie Wall Street, Michael Douglas, Gordon Gekko carries a brick cell phone is making a
[01:13:56.800 --> 01:14:00.800]   lot of calls and it dated the movie funny because the movie isn't dated in any other respect,
[01:14:00.800 --> 01:14:05.440]   but in that respect, it's, it is lead dated. So what he's saying really is,
[01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:12.880]   a glass, we're going to look back on this and say this is early, early days, right?
[01:14:12.880 --> 01:14:18.320]   That it's, there's Gekko with his cell phone. That it's,
[01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:25.600]   the difference though is that with Wall Street and with cell phone, early cell phones,
[01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:31.680]   it sort of made you out to be, you know, well, a dick. Yeah, a dick.
[01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:34.720]   Whereas, all I think it's what I was saying. That's exactly what he was saying. Here's,
[01:14:34.720 --> 01:14:39.920]   here's Danny's quote, Gekko was a jerk, whose jerkiness was only enhanced by his phone and
[01:14:39.920 --> 01:14:48.400]   expensive status symbol of its time. And so people, people will see this initially as
[01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:54.160]   only the wealthy, only the elite will have this. It's a, you know, kind of dicky thing.
[01:14:54.160 --> 01:15:00.080]   And then we start to say how useful it is just as we did with cell phones, they become ubiquitous.
[01:15:00.080 --> 01:15:03.200]   And then it's like you're crazy if you don't have, they're de-dick.
[01:15:03.200 --> 01:15:06.400]   They're de-dickified. I think in, in the, with cell phones, it was dicks,
[01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:09.840]   whereas glass, it's more nerds. I think there's a subtle, dicky nerds.
[01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:14.720]   I think it was a, a dicky nerd. Go to, go to white men wearing Google glass.com.
[01:15:14.720 --> 01:15:15.920]   Right. Yeah. Exactly.
[01:15:15.920 --> 01:15:21.680]   This is, it's the techno utopian, like, lots of disposable income, you know, just someone who is
[01:15:21.680 --> 01:15:25.280]   wealthy and thinks that, you know, it needs to be connected all the time. So I, I do think that
[01:15:25.280 --> 01:15:30.800]   there's this, there is, there's a nerd aspect to it. But right now it's like the very connected
[01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:35.920]   nerd, connected meaning like access to, you know, the explorer program, right? And wealthy,
[01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:40.160]   right? There's definitely 100 bucks. Yeah. There you go. Hi, I'm where it is.
[01:15:40.160 --> 01:15:43.360]   He's on the stroll and, yeah. There's some nuances. I was there this morning.
[01:15:43.360 --> 01:15:47.280]   Oh, it's got a high firmmen on Twitter. There's low week, low week lemur.
[01:15:47.280 --> 01:15:51.040]   Tim Stevens, Lance, well enough.
[01:15:52.720 --> 01:15:56.480]   And there's Mark Andreessen. And yeah, yeah, that's the glass.
[01:15:56.480 --> 01:16:01.920]   The middle guy, that's just, that's too much. Yeah. These guys look normal.
[01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:07.360]   I can live with them. And then we go back, go back to that. That's the old guy who's like us.
[01:16:07.360 --> 01:16:11.040]   Is the glass? He's wearing glass over glasses. Right.
[01:16:11.040 --> 01:16:17.440]   Well, he has made it separately. Where's, oh, maybe took the rest of what that's weird.
[01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:21.040]   The rest is missing. He's at Google. He's a Googler. So they, they, they,
[01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:26.000]   they especially crafted glass. Yes. So they took that one part and put it all
[01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.720]   and clipped it off. You know, I have to admit that doesn't look so bad. I mean,
[01:16:28.720 --> 01:16:32.480]   it's you're wearing glasses and you have a little thing on the top of it. The beard helps.
[01:16:32.480 --> 01:16:38.800]   I'll grow a beard. I bet they'll have fashionable worries, you know, pretty soon.
[01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:46.880]   That was William Gibson. Was it? Yeah. That's cool. I bet he worked for three seconds and said,
[01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:50.800]   get this off. There's a story somewhere like it. He did? Yeah.
[01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:56.960]   Creator of a neuro-mancer in the cyberpunk movement, great sci-fi writer who
[01:16:56.960 --> 01:17:03.920]   is not necessarily a fan of technology. No, he's not at all. Yeah.
[01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:12.160]   Interesting. Well, you know, you notice it's getting more mainstream as we go down the page.
[01:17:13.440 --> 01:17:19.200]   No, there's Joshua Topolsky. Yeah. This is the dreaded sculple pictures.
[01:17:19.200 --> 01:17:25.600]   Okay. There we go. Okay. I have to overcome that one.
[01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:30.880]   Oh, that's fun. I, you know, these people look more normal. So I don't, I don't think it's so,
[01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:35.600]   yeah, I want to see LeVar Burton wearing him. Yeah. Where's Jordy LaForges glass?
[01:17:35.600 --> 01:17:40.640]   That's a first guy I'd give glass to. Got to happen. Come on, marketing. Yeah.
[01:17:41.360 --> 01:17:44.960]   Get on it. We're going to take a break. Let's see. Any other big stories before we move on.
[01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:50.880]   Google has made it easier to turn its pixels into highly expensive kiosks.
[01:17:50.880 --> 01:17:56.000]   No, no takers. Any Chromebook. Any Chromebook. Any Chromebook. Yeah.
[01:17:56.000 --> 01:17:59.280]   But you want to touch. It was nice and expensive ones. Yeah. You might want to use a pixel because
[01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:03.200]   you want the touch, right? No, you don't want all those greasy fingers on it.
[01:18:07.920 --> 01:18:12.800]   Android 4.3 is still going to be named Jelly Bean. According to Android police.
[01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:17.040]   This is kind of, yeah, this is kind of disappointing. It's possible.
[01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:20.240]   And Android police did some investigative work. It's possible that we're going to see
[01:18:20.240 --> 01:18:25.520]   Android 4.3 in two weeks at IO and not key lime pie. Yep. I think that's quite.
[01:18:25.520 --> 01:18:28.000]   Just a little bit of, I don't know. It's a little bit of a bummer. As a developer, I was like,
[01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:34.800]   I wanted, I wanted the next, the next letter. But apparently Jelly Bean 4.3 is in testing right now.
[01:18:34.800 --> 01:18:38.400]   There's a build in testing right now. And we're looking at IO in two weeks. So
[01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:42.000]   it looks like that's going to be the next release. Maybe the preview key lime pie,
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:47.600]   though, at IO, maybe and not release it. But there is a build to kind of in the works right
[01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:54.320]   now, Jelly Bean. So. And if you were sourced in high in CEO of Blackberry, that's pretty amazing.
[01:18:54.320 --> 01:19:03.840]   Would you, how would you feel about the future of mobile technology? We're going to have to
[01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:08.160]   sit through an ad here. It looks like before we can see. I want to see what he really said.
[01:19:08.160 --> 01:19:13.280]   Thorsden Hines. Do you have it? Do you have it on there? Should I turn it up?
[01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:18.240]   Sounds like somebody who's on the looking silent. So does it? Yeah. He actually doesn't.
[01:19:18.240 --> 01:19:22.240]   He doesn't say what he said he would say. You've been debuting it here and here in Hollywood.
[01:19:22.240 --> 01:19:27.200]   Right. No, he's talking about the Q10. Q10 and not about 10.
[01:19:27.200 --> 01:19:32.160]   Okay. But he, according to somebody, and I don't know if he said this or not, he thought that
[01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:37.440]   Bloomberg said he says if this is the quote in five years, I don't think there'll be a reason to have
[01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:42.160]   a tablet anymore. Maybe a big screen in your workplace, but not a tablet as such. Tablets
[01:19:42.160 --> 01:19:47.920]   themselves are not a good business model. Maybe I'd say that if our Blackberry heat, they put out
[01:19:47.920 --> 01:19:54.720]   the playbook, which was a great failure. Yeah. I guess his point being what that you're going to
[01:19:54.720 --> 01:20:01.840]   use phones instead of a lot of tablets or other or glass or glass or smart watches. He may not be
[01:20:01.840 --> 01:20:05.040]   wrong. It may not be wrong or just a big touch panel.
[01:20:05.040 --> 01:20:12.400]   Yeah. I use the only thing I use my tablet for is to watch movies when I'm on the road in the
[01:20:12.400 --> 01:20:17.520]   train or something. That's pretty much it. I'm sorry. I read the New York Times on it every day.
[01:20:17.520 --> 01:20:21.680]   Better for reading. I read books. Yeah. Read books. Yeah. That's right. I keep on adding
[01:20:21.680 --> 01:20:28.000]   not be. I do a lot of things. The problem is that my Nexus 7, of course, I got the cheap one,
[01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:33.920]   so it's not internet connected. So that probably has an impact on my use.
[01:20:33.920 --> 01:20:38.560]   Chipotle has been banned in East Chester, New York. I'm sorry. You could guess where that
[01:20:38.560 --> 01:20:49.360]   went from. What? What? Why? I think real estate snobbery, actually.
[01:20:49.360 --> 01:20:56.160]   We don't want anything like that in East Chester. We don't believe in that. We don't
[01:20:56.160 --> 01:21:02.320]   talk about you. Dig finds 40% of respondents willing to pay for a Google reader replacement.
[01:21:02.320 --> 01:21:06.320]   Dig, of course, said they were going to do a replacement part of beta works.
[01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:11.280]   They're always dubious. I suppose surveys about willingness to pay.
[01:21:11.280 --> 01:21:15.680]   They're willing to answer a survey. That's what that's.
[01:21:15.680 --> 01:21:22.000]   Yeah. I wouldn't base my financial model on that.
[01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:26.640]   Sure. I'll pay chat room. How many of you would pay for twig?
[01:21:26.640 --> 01:21:29.200]   Yeah, no. I think I'm going to ask them that.
[01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:35.360]   Yeah. None of us.
[01:21:35.360 --> 01:21:37.760]   Now, Ben.
[01:21:37.760 --> 01:21:43.200]   Yes, 40% said yes, but that means 60% said no.
[01:21:43.200 --> 01:21:48.240]   And none of those people will pay. Well, here's the numbers for the New York Times.
[01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:55.920]   If you round up, it has approximately almost 60 million unique users, of whom about 3 million
[01:21:55.920 --> 01:22:01.040]   hit the wall and of whom 600,000 paid pure only digital success.
[01:22:01.040 --> 01:22:04.080]   About right. Yeah. 1%. It says about right. Yeah.
[01:22:04.080 --> 01:22:10.640]   What apparently beta works is thinking is that they don't want to do a ad-based version.
[01:22:10.640 --> 01:22:16.400]   They'd like to do a paid version. It says free products on the internet don't have a
[01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:19.760]   great track record. We need to build a product people can rely on and trust will always be there
[01:22:19.760 --> 01:22:23.360]   for them. I think there's a move in that direction among a number of that's pinboard.
[01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:26.240]   That's what they said. We're not going to do delicious. We're going to charge you.
[01:22:26.240 --> 01:22:30.240]   Yeah. How well is that working? I don't know. And it could be, you know, it could be a good
[01:22:30.240 --> 01:22:34.400]   business, but it's going to be a very small business. As long as people here's, but you build
[01:22:34.400 --> 01:22:38.000]   in the profit, right? I mean, it's like Twitter. We're not huge. Well, no, there's a market.
[01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:41.520]   Here's what always was forgotten. And I know this from my days in the magazine business.
[01:22:41.520 --> 01:22:47.360]   There's a subscriber acquisition cost and there's churn. And so you've got to have some,
[01:22:47.360 --> 01:22:51.840]   you need a critical mass. And that means you got a marketing cost. And it's a large marketing cost.
[01:22:51.840 --> 01:22:57.840]   Good point. When magazines, when I started E.W.,
[01:22:57.840 --> 01:23:03.920]   our subscriber acquisition cost was run in $25 to require a subscriber.
[01:23:03.920 --> 01:23:08.240]   And we, you know, we charge you very little. We make it on the third or fourth year of the
[01:23:08.240 --> 01:23:13.440]   subscription. And that's how it works. When I was a Delphi subscriber acquisition cost was run
[01:23:13.440 --> 01:23:18.720]   in about $100. I'm sure it was the same for AOL in the other early online services. Very
[01:23:18.720 --> 01:23:24.320]   expensive. Those free disks cost something. Exactly. Good point. Although nowadays,
[01:23:24.320 --> 01:23:28.480]   because of the internet, I think customer acquisition costs must be a lot lower. They've got the name.
[01:23:28.480 --> 01:23:35.120]   I don't know. I mean, if they get it, well, they've got the name dig. And they also bought
[01:23:35.120 --> 01:23:41.360]   Instapaper from Marco last week. I love the guys. It's worse. We'd be clear here. But I think that
[01:23:41.360 --> 01:23:45.440]   if you want to get to some critical mass of size. Right. Okay.
[01:23:45.440 --> 01:23:51.920]   You know, there's a postures replacement yesterday postures closed down Twitter bottom.
[01:23:51.920 --> 01:23:57.440]   Thank you, Twitter. I loved it as a blogging service. But the two of the founders started
[01:23:57.440 --> 01:24:00.480]   something called Posthaven. They said, we're just going to charge you five bucks a month.
[01:24:00.480 --> 01:24:03.600]   That way, we know we're covering our costs and we can guarantee you this will never go down.
[01:24:04.400 --> 01:24:10.160]   That's a good idea. Yeah. I thought it was postures. Postures, postures. It's dead now. It doesn't
[01:24:10.160 --> 01:24:15.520]   really matter. It doesn't matter anymore. You can call it whatever you want. Whatever you want.
[01:24:15.520 --> 01:24:21.680]   It doesn't work. But posthaven.com will end well, it's too late, I guess, would have imported
[01:24:21.680 --> 01:24:28.000]   your postures data. It's post postures. Post posters. I did it. That is a good rationale for
[01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:32.240]   charging. Right. I mean, that you it was a free service to make it. Twitter bought us.
[01:24:32.240 --> 01:24:36.720]   And so you don't have to worry about someone, you know, failing or because you pay.
[01:24:36.720 --> 01:24:42.800]   If not enough people buy it and you're committed and you've got fixed costs for servers or whatever.
[01:24:42.800 --> 01:24:48.000]   Well, I think if you if a thousand people pay five bucks, that's going to pay for what you need.
[01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:53.920]   But just again, I go back. I'm sorry, but there's churn. Right. So what's what's it called? What
[01:24:53.920 --> 01:25:00.240]   was the Twitter alternative app? I've done that. Right. And nice people and I went ahead and
[01:25:00.240 --> 01:25:04.000]   paid the money and all of them. I didn't use it and I couldn't stand people coming along and say
[01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:08.960]   they've subscribed to me and I don't do anything there. Right. So I pulled out entirely and I didn't
[01:25:08.960 --> 01:25:12.480]   realize the laugh. I did that. They have a free version too. But that tells you something right
[01:25:12.480 --> 01:25:16.640]   there to hold on to people. They need to do that. No, it's a good point. They could so they could
[01:25:16.640 --> 01:25:22.000]   by the way, you can't sign up for it anymore because last day to do so was yesterday.
[01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:30.160]   Postures is down now or postures. I guess if they got down to a hundred users, it would
[01:25:30.160 --> 01:25:33.360]   be and made $500 a month. It wouldn't be worth their time.
[01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:38.640]   Right. Right. Exactly. There's some level of mass. It's not fair.
[01:25:38.640 --> 01:25:43.040]   Yeah. Okay. But do you think these kind of services that have social built into them really
[01:25:43.040 --> 01:25:47.360]   well? Something like post Haven and I guess is what it's called. Do you feel like the marketing
[01:25:47.360 --> 01:25:51.520]   cost is kind of built in? Do you feel like the marketing kind of does it itself? Because presumably
[01:25:51.520 --> 01:25:55.920]   people are sharing links to their post Haven blog and it's kind of advertising itself, which I
[01:25:55.920 --> 01:26:01.120]   think is kind of different than I agree. It's not a magazine. Yeah, it's not a magazine. It's a social
[01:26:01.120 --> 01:26:05.840]   tool. So it's a fixed cost or lower. But there is a point beyond which it could be too small.
[01:26:05.840 --> 01:26:11.280]   But you still need growth, right? Do you? Why? Do you find new users somehow? Why? Why? I don't know.
[01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:15.760]   No, you don't. Only if you want a business. Well, that's yeah, that's what I'm saying. Well,
[01:26:15.760 --> 01:26:18.480]   actually, not even if you want a business, if you're content with a business that doesn't grow,
[01:26:18.480 --> 01:26:23.200]   I think there's always this presumption, oh, we got to get bigger and bigger. And I don't think
[01:26:23.200 --> 01:26:31.680]   you have to always get bigger. Do you? Let's say that they built into this enough to pay for a
[01:26:31.680 --> 01:26:36.560]   sys admin and as many servers as they need for five bucks a month. And they just run it forever.
[01:26:36.560 --> 01:26:40.720]   Well, but they want their one engineering team that's going to constantly kind of innovate,
[01:26:40.720 --> 01:26:45.760]   make it better, right? That costs money. It doesn't do a lot of what Postress used to do or Postress
[01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:51.920]   used to really evolve. Did you guys see ghosts that open source blogging platform Kickstarter?
[01:26:51.920 --> 01:26:57.440]   Oh, yeah, that really it kind of warmed my heart. It really did. I guess I'm sort of an old school
[01:26:57.440 --> 01:27:03.120]   web person, but I'm like, yeah, man, 2013 as an open source blogging platform, getting bill
[01:27:03.120 --> 01:27:09.120]   by somebody who worked on WordPress forever. John, no, Nolan. Yeah, yeah. You get a picture of
[01:27:09.120 --> 01:27:13.120]   her. You see, Zach Braff financed the sequel to go to the state.
[01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:19.200]   Two plus. A lot of people really upset about that. Really? Why? Well, because he isn't.
[01:27:19.200 --> 01:27:23.120]   Yeah, I mean, is that worth? Is any worth like 22 million? What's he going to do?
[01:27:23.120 --> 01:27:31.120]   They say in the movie business, you shouldn't back your own movies. You should use some other
[01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:36.080]   money. I mean, I think this gave him freedom from, you know, that's, that's, there's, there's,
[01:27:36.080 --> 01:27:39.760]   there's this kind of anti rich view that if you have money, you should all use it. You should
[01:27:39.760 --> 01:27:43.840]   never ask for money. Well, you know, he could go to the studios to ask for money. And then he said
[01:27:43.840 --> 01:27:47.760]   it was going to affect the product, or he can go to the fans and ask for money. This is a very
[01:27:47.760 --> 01:27:53.840]   Amanda Palmer. And Amanda Palmer people hate Amanda Palmer for the same reason. Not all.
[01:27:53.840 --> 01:27:59.920]   Some do. It'll be like very much loyal fans. It just feels like Kickstarter is a platform for
[01:27:59.920 --> 01:28:03.760]   artists who have a lot of talent, but just don't have the money or don't have the faith from the,
[01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:08.960]   the traditional sort of backers. So it's hard. I mean, I mean, I don't know. Maybe I got to look,
[01:28:08.960 --> 01:28:13.680]   like Veronica Mars, for example, that I backed happily because I was like, I want this. I'm a
[01:28:13.680 --> 01:28:18.880]   huge fan. I don't have no idea how, how rich or not Ralph Thomas is, whether or not he could have
[01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:23.120]   funded himself. But I felt like really, really good about that. The zap bra thing, I was sort of like,
[01:28:23.120 --> 01:28:26.720]   I don't know, maybe I'm just not as a big fan of Garden State or his, of his work. But I was a
[01:28:26.720 --> 01:28:37.360]   little bit like, Gina, I love the Garden State back in the day when I saw it. I wasn't like, when
[01:28:37.360 --> 01:28:41.600]   are we going to get the sequel or the, you know, the next Garden State? I was really not why about
[01:28:41.600 --> 01:28:47.920]   Veronica Mars. So I, you know, I don't know. Listen, I get it. It makes sense. I just, it's hard for,
[01:28:47.920 --> 01:28:52.240]   you know, Braff did this whole thing about how, you know, the man was going to like ruin his movie.
[01:28:52.240 --> 01:28:58.240]   And it's kind of like, dude, you could, you could use your own money. I mean, you are the man. Yeah.
[01:28:58.240 --> 01:29:00.800]   I think that was the sentiment. Like you are the man.
[01:29:00.800 --> 01:29:05.920]   But shouldn't, but Gina shouldn't, shouldn't kickstart or be for connecting with your fans. I mean,
[01:29:05.920 --> 01:29:10.400]   if you're, if you're rich or not, if a man of Palmer has millions of dollars, shouldn't it be,
[01:29:10.960 --> 01:29:15.120]   you know, I'm just trying to play devil's advocate. Shouldn't it be a platform for you
[01:29:15.120 --> 01:29:18.960]   to allow your fans to, to participate in what you're doing?
[01:29:18.960 --> 01:29:23.840]   Absolutely. Absolutely. I guess I just feel better when I see kickstarter bring kind of unknowns
[01:29:23.840 --> 01:29:28.080]   and do I want to see, you know, completely unknown filmmaker who's just really young and smart
[01:29:28.080 --> 01:29:32.240]   and hustles, you know, when, you know, when it's on dance or whatever. Like that makes, that's just
[01:29:32.240 --> 01:29:36.640]   a, that makes, that's a story that makes me feel better than someone like Braff or, or
[01:29:36.640 --> 01:29:42.640]   just that. I also want to see the platform be successful and having some, having some well-known
[01:29:42.640 --> 01:29:47.280]   names in there is part of what I think makes kickstarter accessible. Did you see Amanda Palmer's
[01:29:47.280 --> 01:29:53.120]   TED talk? I did it. It's in my to watch. It's in my insta paper too. You should, because it's
[01:29:53.120 --> 01:29:57.440]   really what really well done. And, and I think it's a model for, for some media. Yeah, but there's
[01:29:57.440 --> 01:30:04.480]   moments, there are, there are cringe worthy moments in there. Like when she says this poor family that
[01:30:05.600 --> 01:30:09.280]   they gave us her their beds and they slipped in the living room so we can sleep in their beds.
[01:30:09.280 --> 01:30:14.320]   And I understand what she was saying and I, and I kind of get it and support it, but it did kind,
[01:30:14.320 --> 01:30:19.920]   it was a little cringe worthy like, yeah, okay, that's nice. That was a very Ted moment.
[01:30:19.920 --> 01:30:26.400]   But this is, you know what I hear, let me, let me propose this that what you don't like about
[01:30:26.400 --> 01:30:30.560]   it, Gina is it's, and the same thing with Veronica Mars, it's a, which you did like,
[01:30:30.560 --> 01:30:35.120]   it's moved, it's a backwards move, it's an nostalgia move, and I would like to see kickstarter support
[01:30:35.120 --> 01:30:40.880]   forwards, not backwards. Yeah, new thing. Yes. That's a good point. But I mean,
[01:30:40.880 --> 01:30:45.200]   there is, there are a lot of people want to get that graph two million. Why don't, why can't they?
[01:30:45.200 --> 01:30:49.600]   They're giving, they're giving, and that would be the other question is as long as people who are
[01:30:49.600 --> 01:30:53.840]   donating, understanding what they're getting, which is not a zilch zip,
[01:30:53.840 --> 01:30:59.440]   bump kiss, I got, I got into, I got into a big tip for one of my students a year ago,
[01:30:59.440 --> 01:31:06.720]   and I'll give him credit now that he went, he went after matter, which was a site that was up
[01:31:06.720 --> 01:31:12.800]   from journalist, you long form and charge, and I think he raised up like $140,000, and he went
[01:31:12.800 --> 01:31:16.080]   after them. I went after my student thought, you know, you're just being rude about this,
[01:31:16.080 --> 01:31:23.280]   my student was right. Matter was just bought by medium. And my student did a post then that said,
[01:31:23.280 --> 01:31:27.760]   you know, okay, folks, what did you get for your 140 grand? Yeah, maybe you got a couple articles,
[01:31:27.760 --> 01:31:32.800]   but you've supported something that in turn just got sold, and there's no expectation of equity here,
[01:31:32.800 --> 01:31:36.880]   and that's fine. That's what it is. But, you know, what did you really support? You've got to think
[01:31:36.880 --> 01:31:40.400]   about what you're supporting when you do that. Now, I would argue, let me try nothing on you,
[01:31:40.400 --> 01:31:46.400]   Jeanette. I don't know if you were an arrested development fan. I am. Okay, so Netflix came
[01:31:46.400 --> 01:31:49.680]   along and Netflix is the salvation to bring it back. But let's imagine Netflix weren't there.
[01:31:49.680 --> 01:31:52.720]   Let's imagine the producers said we want to bring back a rest of the development. We want to put
[01:31:52.720 --> 01:32:00.080]   it on the web. Whatever the business model is, let's go to Kickstarter.
[01:32:00.080 --> 01:32:04.080]   Why not? Yeah, maybe I'm just being too subjective about this because I'm just like,
[01:32:04.080 --> 01:32:10.720]   well, that's all I mean, no, I liked Garden State. I didn't feel like there was like a clamoring for
[01:32:10.720 --> 01:32:17.920]   another. There was a similar or Russian development. There is there is there is a huge fan base.
[01:32:17.920 --> 01:32:22.640]   It got canceled too soon. Like this is and this is what happened with Veronica Mars, right?
[01:32:22.640 --> 01:32:25.360]   Like it just never got a fair shake out for the same way about Firefly,
[01:32:25.360 --> 01:32:31.200]   Serenity or or or Dollhouse like any kind of any kind of series that got cut off too soon.
[01:32:31.200 --> 01:32:35.920]   That's just our track. Okay, so let's try that. Let's try that. So Star Trek gets canceled
[01:32:35.920 --> 01:32:41.120]   in 2013. Like the original Star Trek is okay.
[01:32:41.120 --> 01:32:46.240]   Original Star Trek, right? Okay. Yeah. And now the fans the fans were right letters and all this
[01:32:46.240 --> 01:32:51.600]   and they can't get anywhere. Now they could come and say, well, if them, we can we can back this
[01:32:51.600 --> 01:32:55.680]   thing. So Leo fails Leo's test. It's going backward, but it's also taking something that's
[01:32:55.680 --> 01:33:02.480]   known and liked and supported. Yeah, no, I'm being supported supported that, you know, for me,
[01:33:02.480 --> 01:33:06.640]   it's the rich thing. It's it's that it's that I know that Dick Raff has enough money to fund his own
[01:33:06.640 --> 01:33:10.080]   movie. And Jeff, you're probably right. I mean, I don't know. I don't have that kind of money. So
[01:33:10.080 --> 01:33:13.760]   I don't know really what the rules are. I get I get I don't know why wouldn't you tell you
[01:33:13.760 --> 01:33:19.520]   tell you should never be subsidized by CW, isn't it? I mean, that CW is putting up like they
[01:33:19.520 --> 01:33:24.880]   they're matching stuff like that. So it's not just like a leader who's right, right, right?
[01:33:24.880 --> 01:33:30.320]   The creator basically said if we if enough fans kick in, then the man will match or there's some
[01:33:30.320 --> 01:33:34.240]   deal where they said the studio said, look, we'll help you if you get this few raises much money.
[01:33:34.240 --> 01:33:38.960]   If you prove that there's enough interest kind of upfront, I think we can agree that there are ways
[01:33:38.960 --> 01:33:44.560]   we'd like to see Kickstarter used to do forward looking public projects for the public good.
[01:33:44.560 --> 01:33:51.520]   However, you also it's an open platform. And so you're going to get people doing things that
[01:33:51.520 --> 01:33:58.000]   we might not agree with. But if people put money kick money in and are and are and as long as they
[01:33:58.000 --> 01:34:02.480]   understand what they're doing that they're not they're not getting a chair and garden state,
[01:34:02.480 --> 01:34:05.520]   they're not getting anything. They're not even getting a movie. They're just saying,
[01:34:05.520 --> 01:34:09.760]   yeah, I'll give you 10 bucks. If you please do it, but you may get nothing because I've learned
[01:34:09.760 --> 01:34:12.640]   that lesson kind of the hard way on Kickstarter. I got a lot of nothing.
[01:34:12.640 --> 01:34:18.960]   The examples that Jeff was using though, I mean, of matter, you know, you wouldn't have known,
[01:34:18.960 --> 01:34:24.720]   oh, there's a potential that they're going to sell what I just funded to understand. You could be
[01:34:24.720 --> 01:34:30.640]   a you could be suckered by this. So all you're doing is using money to cast a vote in favor of
[01:34:30.640 --> 01:34:34.640]   something you want to see and you're getting nothing for as long as you understand that. I don't
[01:34:34.640 --> 01:34:39.280]   think there's anything wrong with it. You get the reward. Right? There's a reward. Yeah, get a t-shirt.
[01:34:39.280 --> 01:34:44.320]   You get the reward that you agreed to, right? Like you you agree up for a reward. It's not like
[01:34:44.320 --> 01:34:48.560]   you're not getting anything. Right? I mean, assuming that the greater knowledge through.
[01:34:48.560 --> 01:34:53.520]   Well, but you might also think this pebble watch is going to be really cool. And then get it and go
[01:34:53.520 --> 01:34:58.560]   gee. Yeah, no fair enough. Now that that you do have to be aware of. They might make they might
[01:34:58.560 --> 01:35:04.800]   make Garden State too and might be like my weekend with Bernie. Right. That's better badly.
[01:35:04.800 --> 01:35:08.480]   Yeah. You be the judge. You never know.
[01:35:08.480 --> 01:35:15.120]   That's raised the money. There's obviously the fan base. I just my personally had a hard time
[01:35:15.120 --> 01:35:20.400]   sending Zach Braff 10 bucks because I think I need my 10 bucks more than Zach Braff. Yeah,
[01:35:20.400 --> 01:35:24.400]   don't send him the money. I didn't I didn't I didn't back it. I'll actually probably see the
[01:35:24.400 --> 01:35:27.600]   movie. Right. But I just I just didn't back. You'll give me 10 bucks then.
[01:35:27.600 --> 01:35:34.320]   Right. Yeah, you get enough of that. You include the babysitter. It's gonna cost you some pretty
[01:35:34.320 --> 01:35:40.640]   pennies. You see that. I know. Seriously. Oh, it's just classic. I should just back up. I got the
[01:35:40.640 --> 01:35:44.880]   digital job. But I would not think of the babysitter. But I can tell you Amber MacArthur who wanted
[01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:50.240]   the Mary Zach Braff is so excited and she gave money and she's this is the greatest thing ever.
[01:35:50.240 --> 01:35:54.960]   So there you go. I mean, it's just to each his own. Yeah, it might be just my subjective sort of
[01:35:54.960 --> 01:36:00.400]   fan where my I understand what you're saying because I feel queasy about Kickstarter all the
[01:36:00.400 --> 01:36:06.640]   time. But I can't put my finger on it. So here let me give you the man the Amanda Palmer thing was
[01:36:06.640 --> 01:36:10.400]   what she says that at some point if you just open up an app people right they become good
[01:36:10.400 --> 01:36:14.560]   in a recent gift. Yeah, as opposed to this whole notion Matthew and I love to go on about and get
[01:36:14.560 --> 01:36:20.080]   in trouble for pay walls. You must pay. I'm gonna require you to pay. You should pay. You're bad
[01:36:20.080 --> 01:36:24.640]   if you don't pay. Right. And that's the attitude we have in media. Whereas what Amanda says is
[01:36:24.640 --> 01:36:28.560]   she was just a street performer. People just gave her money and she gave him smiles or flowers or
[01:36:28.560 --> 01:36:33.120]   songs. I don't know why we have to have one or the other. We don't. We don't. But she's she's
[01:36:33.120 --> 01:36:37.120]   she's at least say well in the L on media we only got two. We've got advertising and pay walls. And
[01:36:37.120 --> 01:36:40.800]   that's it. We're replicating the old models. No, there's three. We can ask for money. I mean,
[01:36:40.800 --> 01:36:45.840]   this is the new way of doing it. Yeah. Right. So Amanda says so Amanda came out with one album
[01:36:45.840 --> 01:36:51.760]   and it sold 25,000 copies and she thought that's pretty good. Label said no, it's not. It's awful.
[01:36:51.760 --> 01:36:57.360]   So she's out. She's gone. Next time comes around. So I'm going to get started to get the thing
[01:36:57.360 --> 01:37:04.400]   supported. It was 25,000 people gave her whatever was $1.2 million. Right. So it was the same number
[01:37:04.400 --> 01:37:09.440]   of people. Yep. Was able to support something by just opening up and giving them the opportunity
[01:37:09.440 --> 01:37:14.400]   if they wanted to ask the requirement. Obviously, they didn't require it. Right. Nothing. And this
[01:37:14.400 --> 01:37:19.520]   is the goal. Go ahead. But this is the promise of the internet and that's why it's great because
[01:37:19.520 --> 01:37:24.000]   now there are more ways to do this. There's another great Kickstarter project of today.
[01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:31.280]   Planet Money, Adam Davidson and company from NPR who just did a great job of covering the
[01:37:31.280 --> 01:37:35.760]   financial crisis. They want to follow a t-shirt from the cotton farm all the way through.
[01:37:36.480 --> 01:37:40.880]   So it's a put in $25 in the project and you're going to get the story of your t-shirt.
[01:37:40.880 --> 01:37:44.400]   Out of that, which is a nice idea for subsidizing the journalistic thing.
[01:37:44.400 --> 01:37:49.680]   Fully funded. Now, see, this is the other question. They asked for 50,000. They got 73. What happens
[01:37:49.680 --> 01:37:55.040]   the other 23? Profit. They could use the money to do really good reporting. I've got no problem
[01:37:55.040 --> 01:37:59.520]   with anything in overage because they're public radio. They'll do what they call it.
[01:37:59.520 --> 01:38:02.640]   What if it was Zach Braff? Aren't they fully funded already?
[01:38:03.440 --> 01:38:08.640]   I think they'll say that they'll say that, well, then we'll contribute the rest of the money to
[01:38:08.640 --> 01:38:11.200]   the movie. We'll just make the movie better. That's what they do for Ron and Khmer's.
[01:38:11.200 --> 01:38:15.040]   Any overage, we'll have better shooting locations. We'll be able to spend more day shooting.
[01:38:15.040 --> 01:38:19.120]   Better caterer. Well, right. But you know, with Ron and Khmer's, they were like,
[01:38:19.120 --> 01:38:22.880]   well, shooting in Southern California, which is where we shot the show. We wouldn't be able to afford
[01:38:22.880 --> 01:38:28.160]   that if I just get the minimum. So they don't say on this one, on the t-shirt one, what they're
[01:38:28.160 --> 01:38:33.920]   going to do with the 23,000 extra dollars. But I think that's easy. They do a lot of good reporting.
[01:38:33.920 --> 01:38:36.480]   I don't but crunch it. I agree. I think they're wonderful.
[01:38:36.480 --> 01:38:42.000]   They did the best reporting. They did the giant pool of money it was called. It was a
[01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:48.160]   co-project with This America Life. If you listen to it, people, it is the best explanation of how
[01:38:48.160 --> 01:38:53.680]   we got in the financial crisis. Beautifully done. I actually like the idea of doing special
[01:38:53.680 --> 01:38:58.480]   reporting projects like that, you know, kicks out and funded or especially funded.
[01:38:58.480 --> 01:39:03.760]   Because the people of the game and the PR bunch money give them something for a specific project.
[01:39:03.760 --> 01:39:07.920]   Yeah. I'd like to see more companies try to do that, more media companies.
[01:39:07.920 --> 01:39:13.680]   Yeah, I just I just back the Aaron Swartz documentary. That's something I'm really kind of excited about.
[01:39:13.680 --> 01:39:20.800]   So this is great. I mean, I and then you look at projects and some of as long as people know what
[01:39:20.800 --> 01:39:24.720]   they're getting when they give money, which is the only question mark in my mind.
[01:39:24.720 --> 01:39:30.640]   Yeah. Then it's great. And I think that kickstart has done everything they can. And you know,
[01:39:30.640 --> 01:39:35.040]   when they started Kickstarter, it really was about funding creative projects like plays, movies,
[01:39:35.040 --> 01:39:40.880]   comic books, novels. It was it was for the arts. And the fact that it's become so much more I think
[01:39:40.880 --> 01:39:47.520]   is interesting. And what it means is there's new there's new ways to fund things that
[01:39:49.200 --> 01:39:54.320]   make more possible for us. That's great. That's creativity funds creativity at all.
[01:39:54.320 --> 01:39:59.120]   And then happy. Yes, I'm going to take a break. Actually had a couple more things. What was it?
[01:39:59.120 --> 01:40:07.440]   Oh, I should mention this EFF site. That was it. Yeah, it actually has got
[01:40:07.440 --> 01:40:15.120]   who's got your back. Yeah, who's got your back? I think you can Google it. But we talked about it
[01:40:15.120 --> 01:40:22.800]   on the previous show on security now. And I think he made a bitly a bit.ly/whoback.
[01:40:22.800 --> 01:40:30.640]   Let's see if it works. Nope. Why back? Thank you. You got a good memory. That's probably because
[01:40:30.640 --> 01:40:40.960]   you're young. Jeff Needles. Why back? Let's try that. Yep. So bit.ly/bit.ly/whyback.
[01:40:41.600 --> 01:40:45.280]   Who has your back? This is the Electronic Frontier Foundation. They have
[01:40:45.280 --> 01:40:50.800]   co-lated information about which companies help protect which data from the government.
[01:40:50.800 --> 01:40:58.480]   There are six categories ranging from requires a warrant for content to tell users about government
[01:40:58.480 --> 01:41:03.440]   data requests, publishing transparency reports, publishing law enforcement guidelines,
[01:41:03.440 --> 01:41:08.400]   fights for users, privacy rights and courts, all the way to fights for users, privacy rights in
[01:41:08.400 --> 01:41:14.080]   Congress. Apple has one star. They lobby. AT&T is one star. They lobby. They don't do anything else.
[01:41:14.080 --> 01:41:18.080]   Comcast publishes law enforcement guidelines and fights for users, privacy rights in court.
[01:41:18.080 --> 01:41:22.960]   That's it. We'll go down to Google, which has all but one star. They don't tell users about
[01:41:22.960 --> 01:41:28.400]   government data requests. I don't think that's strictly true. I think they do when they can,
[01:41:28.400 --> 01:41:33.200]   but it's not legal. They're not legal and stuff. Right. So I think they did. And Google are both
[01:41:33.200 --> 01:41:37.520]   fighting around. Twitter got that star. Google didn't. Yeah. Both dancing around the same issues.
[01:41:37.520 --> 01:41:41.520]   So I'm not sure. I think Google probably deserves more credit than they get here,
[01:41:41.520 --> 01:41:45.600]   but sonic.net, which is an internet service provider from here in Sonoma County and a really
[01:41:45.600 --> 01:41:52.160]   great company. And Twitter are the only two companies that got all six stars. Verizon zero
[01:41:52.160 --> 01:41:57.920]   stars along with my space. Some good work there. Good work there. Nice job.
[01:41:57.920 --> 01:42:02.640]   So worth looking at. I might question a little bit about this one on
[01:42:03.440 --> 01:42:07.840]   tells users about government data requests because they do they do, but not all of them.
[01:42:07.840 --> 01:42:12.240]   And they can't legally on some of them in which so they gave the out. I remember they gave the
[01:42:12.240 --> 01:42:16.720]   outline. Well, this is we can't say exactly what I think that they've complied with
[01:42:16.720 --> 01:42:24.400]   in every respect that they can. Our tip number and tool of the week. And Matthew,
[01:42:24.400 --> 01:42:28.800]   if you want to give us a tip or a tool or something fun, a recommendation will do that too.
[01:42:28.800 --> 01:42:31.280]   Matthew Ingram is here. Great to have you from giga home.
[01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:36.000]   Jeff Jarvis, Gina Tepani, you're watching this week in Google brought to you today by
[01:42:36.000 --> 01:42:43.040]   99 designs. I should show our T spring contests or a t-shirt. We have our own t-shirt. You know,
[01:42:43.040 --> 01:42:48.160]   and we didn't do Kickstarter. We just did a t-spring T double E S P R I N G dot com slash
[01:42:48.160 --> 01:42:56.960]   twit. What we do is we create a limited edition stuff. We did mugs. We're doing a bobble head.
[01:42:56.960 --> 01:43:00.960]   Right now it's a twit t-shirt, but the story behind it is kind of interesting. This was
[01:43:00.960 --> 01:43:08.480]   design created by designer at 99 designs.com. It's a place where designers go to get work.
[01:43:08.480 --> 01:43:13.120]   It connects businesses seeking good looking, affordable designs with a community of over now
[01:43:13.120 --> 01:43:19.520]   200,000 graphic designers who visit 99 designs.com. So we asked for designs. We got a bunch of them
[01:43:19.520 --> 01:43:25.600]   and and man, I'm thrilled with all of the designs we got. This was the then we asked you to vote.
[01:43:25.600 --> 01:43:30.000]   These were that was a winning design, but you can get all sorts of stuff. Logo design for starting

[01:44:54.160 --> 01:44:56.880]   gotten. I think you're going to want to try it. We actually have a new project we're going to be
[01:44:56.880 --> 01:45:04.160]   putting on 99 design. Stay tuned. I'm kind of excited about it. Time for our tip of the week,
[01:45:04.160 --> 01:45:11.200]   Ms. Tripani. I got this one from Life Hacker. This is one of Google's advanced search operators
[01:45:11.200 --> 01:45:16.880]   that I actually wasn't aware of. You can search with a numerical range by using a dot dot.
[01:45:16.880 --> 01:45:22.640]   Right? If you saw an article, for example, I was looking for my favorite BuzzFeed list of all time,
[01:45:22.640 --> 01:45:26.560]   which is 33 animals who are extremely disappointed in you, which is very funny.
[01:45:26.560 --> 01:45:32.560]   I couldn't remember. Was it 33? Was it 10? Was it 100? You can search a Google. You can do
[01:45:32.560 --> 01:45:40.880]   like one dot dot, 250. Then animals were disappointed in you. Google will return results for any headline
[01:45:40.880 --> 01:45:47.360]   that has a number within that range in it. The Life Hacker example, Life Hacker does a lot of
[01:45:47.360 --> 01:45:51.760]   top 10s. I realize that everyone's probably cringing at the idea. There are so many lists now,
[01:45:51.760 --> 01:45:57.600]   the top 10s or 167 ways to do that. Yes, they're probably killing journalism,
[01:45:57.600 --> 01:46:02.320]   but sometimes they're really fun and funny and a good place to start your research. If you're looking
[01:46:02.320 --> 01:46:07.280]   for a listicle or you're looking for any headline webpage, that dog is so disappointed in me.
[01:46:07.280 --> 01:46:14.320]   Very disappointed. Very disappointed. This list is so appeal-stimate sort of count,
[01:46:14.320 --> 01:46:18.880]   like a brigging. This is totally very frankly shocked and disappointed.
[01:46:21.200 --> 01:46:24.640]   So you can use that numeric range with the dot dot in between numbers if you're looking for any
[01:46:24.640 --> 01:46:28.480]   webpage with a number in it, but you're not sure what that number is, but you just know what the
[01:46:28.480 --> 01:46:33.280]   range is. That is a wild operator. Yeah, it's a crazy operator. Programmers get it because it's
[01:46:33.280 --> 01:46:40.640]   range. It's a range, right, exactly. Boy, that is a weird operator. Only a Python program would
[01:46:40.640 --> 01:46:46.320]   think of putting that in. So when you're looking for 67 ways to juice up your Android phone, you should
[01:46:46.320 --> 01:46:53.360]   just do 10 dot, you know, 100 and you'll find it. That's hysterical.
[01:46:53.360 --> 01:46:58.960]   Does that is PHP? You do PHP programming too, right? Yeah, yeah.
[01:46:58.960 --> 01:47:04.000]   PHP support that operator, the dot dot. You know, that's a good question. I don't know
[01:47:04.000 --> 01:47:07.120]   that I would do it that way. I would just do less than and, you know, greater than, you know,
[01:47:07.120 --> 01:47:12.800]   I would just do a logical and conditional. I don't know if it does ranges. Python does do that,
[01:47:12.800 --> 01:47:17.840]   though, doesn't it? Yeah, one dot dot 10. I should check it because I like it. It's briefer.
[01:47:17.840 --> 01:47:25.600]   And now it's a Google operator. Yes. Jeff Jarvis, your number of the week.
[01:47:25.600 --> 01:47:32.320]   17% of adults in the UK, according to the future of Britain report commissioned by
[01:47:32.320 --> 01:47:39.040]   media agency, 17% of UK adults think that Google has their best interest in heart, tied with
[01:47:40.240 --> 01:47:48.880]   churches. Yeah. Slightly under 19% for supermarkets, but I don't know whether this came before or after
[01:47:48.880 --> 01:47:57.200]   horse meat and their beef. 17%. I think Brits just are not a trusting people. They are not.
[01:47:57.200 --> 01:48:05.200]   That's ridiculous. How can you not trust churches and grocery stores?
[01:48:06.160 --> 01:48:10.800]   Well, I got reasons for churches and grocery stores. And I do Google.
[01:48:10.800 --> 01:48:16.160]   Exactly. Who do they trust? Maggie's actual health service. The national health service,
[01:48:16.160 --> 01:48:21.360]   doctors 37%. Yeah. And that's only 37. There are a bunch of commies, of course.
[01:48:21.360 --> 01:48:27.200]   Wow. I wish I had this. I did not usually think of Britishers as skeptics, but I think that we
[01:48:27.200 --> 01:48:34.800]   can now say the skeptical aisle. Yeah. Big Gin says we trust our government. No, you don't.
[01:48:35.680 --> 01:48:40.160]   Do you, Matthew, want to give us a tip or an app you like or anything like that?
[01:48:40.160 --> 01:48:46.800]   I guess this is kind of a cop out in a way, but Google now, I hadn't really, you know,
[01:48:46.800 --> 01:48:53.200]   I'd looked at the cards and, but I mean, using it at home, I mean, I go so, so few places,
[01:48:53.200 --> 01:48:58.080]   you know, that, and I work at home that the cards weren't really hugely useful. But
[01:48:58.080 --> 01:49:04.480]   when I was traveling in Italy, it became enormously useful. And I really started to see the potential
[01:49:05.440 --> 01:49:10.560]   you know, telling me, bringing up the, the, my boarding pass, telling me, you know,
[01:49:10.560 --> 01:49:15.200]   there was traffic on the way to the airport. So that I did miss my flight. That stuff is,
[01:49:15.200 --> 01:49:20.080]   it's simple, you know, it's just, and it's not rocket science, but it just, it was incredibly
[01:49:20.080 --> 01:49:25.680]   useful. I agree. I'm a fan. In fact, it's to me that's, if Google Glass does that, I'm going to,
[01:49:25.680 --> 01:49:30.240]   I might be very interested. Yeah. Exactly. It was just, it really opened my eyes. Yeah.
[01:49:31.520 --> 01:49:37.920]   I kind of guess I did my, my tools because I showed them both the HTC one and the Galaxy S4. We are,
[01:49:37.920 --> 01:49:42.000]   I'll tell you, there's just no, no question in my mind that Android is not going to have the
[01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:46.960]   park one way or the other. And the nice thing is the amount of choice you have that between the
[01:49:46.960 --> 01:49:55.200]   Nexus four, the Galaxy S4 and the HTC one, there's something for anybody. I put my mom on a Galaxy
[01:49:55.200 --> 01:50:02.320]   Note 2. She's never had a smartphone. And I put it, now Samsung does offer this kind of simple mode.
