[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240]   It's time for Twig this week in Google.
[00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:04.800]   There's all sorts of good news.
[00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:07.480]   Google is starting a local journalism fund.
[00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:12.160]   We'll talk about a better way to get a haircut in the quarantine era.
[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:18.800]   And a little bit more detail about Apple and Google's plan to track COVID contacts.
[00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.600]   It's all coming up next on Twig.
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.680]   This week at Google comes to you from Twig's last past studios.

[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.480]   [MUSIC]

[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.560]   This is Twig.
[00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.760]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.200]   This is Twig.
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:57.480]   This week in Google, episode 555, recorded Wednesday, April 15, 2020.
[00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.560]   Soured on sourdough.
[00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:05.080]   This week in Google is brought to you by World Wide Technology and App Dynamics.

[00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.800]   It's time for Twig this week in.
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.120]   For Stacy, she's face-palming already.
[00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:36.160]   This week in Google, the show where we talk about the latest from the Google verse, the
[00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.320]   Facebook verse, the Twitter verse and everything else that we want to talk about.
[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.240]   Because it's really a show for Jeff and Gina.
[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.240]   Jeff and Stacy.
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.640]   And if Gina were here, Gina, to talk about whatever is on our list.
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:51.640]   Oh, oh.
[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.480]   Stacy's predecessor, the great Gina Trapani, who was our-
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:57.800]   Oh, the old prior girlfriend problem.
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.840]   Yeah, prior girlfriend.
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.760]   Prior co-host, our founding member.
[00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:03.760]   You know what I'm doing?
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:12.120]   I'm a little nostalgic right now because tomorrow, I think, will be the 15th anniversary of the
[00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.840]   very first Twig episode.
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:14.840]   Oh, wow.
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.040]   Congratulations, Theo and Jeff.
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.640]   So we're having a 15- You see the bugs on the screen that we are having a 15th anniversary.
[00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.880]   We've been doing this for 15 years.
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:25.880]   And I'm bringing back the-
[00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:26.880]   That's enough.
[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:27.720]   Goodbye.
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.240]   I had this kind of fantasy as one does it for in the morning.
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.080]   On Sunday, we're doing the 15th anniversary show.
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.960]   And it's a reprise of the original show with Kevin Rose, Patrick Norton and Robert Herron.
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:42.520]   Same for people.
[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:45.640]   And I had this fantasy at the end saying, "Well, that's it.
[00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:46.640]   See ya.
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:47.640]   Hope you have a good life.
[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:48.640]   Bye bye."
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.320]   That will not happen.
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.000]   I will assure you, we're going to keep on going.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.800]   15 years, congratulations, Leo.
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:55.800]   Congratulations.
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:56.800]   Pretty amazing.
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.400]   One of the longest running podcasts.
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.400]   I don't know.
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.120]   Is there anything that's been running longer than our Twitch show?
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.120]   I don't think so.
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.320]   Everybody, I'm in the big studio, but it's kind of weird.
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:12.280]   I feel like I'm surrounded by bank robbers because everybody's wearing masks now.
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:19.760]   Sonoma County, the county we're in, has announced starting tomorrow that everyone outside of
[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.320]   their home must wear a mask at all times.
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.320]   Oh, it's just like New York.
[00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:25.800]   Is that what it is in New York now?
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.800]   He just decreed today.
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:31.600]   Well, our president in absentia, yes.
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:32.600]   Governor Cuomo?
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:33.600]   Yes.
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:34.600]   Yeah.
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.200]   So I think that's interesting.
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:43.400]   So the challenge is, if I have a mask on, I don't think you can hear me quite as well.
[00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.720]   So I don't know what we're going to do.
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.480]   I mean, it's relative, if everybody else is wearing masks and nobody, and we've set this
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:56.240]   up so that nobody ever uses the places that I broadcast from either my office or here.
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:00.000]   Nobody comes over, nobody moves anything, nobody touches anything.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   This microphone is presumably contaminated.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.160]   This computer, this mouse, this keyboard, but nobody's allowed to touch it.
[00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:08.160]   Ever.
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:15.000]   They all have Leo Cooty's and they stay, I mean, Jeff's 20 feet away from me with a mask on.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.640]   So I guess we'll be all right.
[00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:21.480]   I technically am supposed to wear a mask, but I think given that we've taken what Cuomo
[00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:26.520]   ruled is that in cases where you cannot social distance, which is six feet, you put the mask
[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.720]   on.
[00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.520]   This is a little more draconian.
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.840]   They say you should always have it on.
[00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.560]   And then there's, yeah, the issue of where do people get masks?
[00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:41.200]   That's why I am embarking on my sewing adventure, which I'm quite enjoying.
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:46.000]   I realized all of those T-shirts, you know how it is, Jeff, over the years.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   A lot of T-shirts.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.880]   No, Leo, I think swag bags would make a better filter.
[00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:51.440]   Apparently, they do.
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.120]   The best, I was somewhere I read.
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:59.040]   I don't know if it's true, but the best material is blown polypropylene, the kind of material
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:04.040]   used in reusable grocery bags is kind of a plastic-y feeling.
[00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.040]   But you can breathe through it.
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.960]   Apparently, those are the best, that's the best material.
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:09.840]   I've got vacuum cleaner bags.
[00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:10.840]   Yeah, I have stench.
[00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.000]   No, no, no, those are bad because don't they have fiberglass in them?
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   Not all of them.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   Oh, okay.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:15.840]   I was like, no, no, don't do that.
[00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.680]   Mark Times recommended an ViroCare, which is what I got.
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:25.120]   And I'm sorry if you have, I got the most obscure vacuum I could find.
[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:27.880]   So I didn't want to deprive anybody of actual vacuum cleaner bags.
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:32.800]   But I only bought one set of 10, but I'm going to use those as interchangeable filters
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.040]   in my masks.
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:39.520]   My mother said, "You should sign the masks.
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.880]   You could sell them as a designer."
[00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:46.160]   They're going to have company logos, but not the whole thing.
[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:51.400]   It'll just be like, you know, "iter."
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:52.400]   And I'll do it at an angle.
[00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:55.880]   So you'll know, it looks familiar, but you won't know what it is.
[00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:02.200]   Because it's all those old T-shirts I'm cutting up.
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:04.240]   Here's the, I'll report this in the chat.
[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.600]   Oh, no, I'm going to do that.
[00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.160]   The guy who cuts my hair.
[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.160]   Yeah, what's he doing?
[00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.160]   The video.
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.160]   I'll show you.
[00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:12.160]   He's cutting hair.
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:13.800]   How is he cutting hair?
[00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:14.800]   He's in the video.
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:15.800]   He's in the video.
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:16.800]   He put out some sound down.
[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:17.800]   There's no sound.
[00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.800]   I don't need sound.
[00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.800]   I put it in the...
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:22.800]   Let's roll the tape.
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.200]   Here's the guy who cuts Jeff's hair.
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.080]   Oh my God.
[00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:28.520]   This is actually your guy?
[00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:29.520]   This is my guy.
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:30.520]   This is my guy.
[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:31.880]   Jeff, do you see my screen?
[00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:33.360]   There it is.
[00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.440]   So James, he's the audio.
[00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:36.440]   James, the audio.
[00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:39.160]   And Warren, New Jersey, Hair Studio.
[00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.280]   He's in a tent.
[00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:43.280]   I've never seen a standing tent.
[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:44.280]   I haven't either.
[00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.400]   I've kind of figured out how that works.
[00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:46.640]   And then he's cut holes in it.
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:47.640]   Did he build a tent?
[00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:51.240]   Because they sell those kind of tents for like changing at the beach.
[00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:53.000]   Oh, that's probably what it is.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   Really?
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   Oh.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   So you sit in front of him.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.480]   He reaches his hands wearing gloves.
[00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:04.200]   Through the tent, he's wearing a mask and the tent protects you from most of the fibers.
[00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:07.040]   And that looks like a pretty good way of doing it.
[00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:08.040]   There might be a little leakage.
[00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:11.080]   I have to get one of these for my hair cutter.
[00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:12.280]   Sure would be nice.
[00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:14.440]   Yeah, so I'm getting tempted.
[00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:17.720]   So I have a beard trimmer, right, with various settings.
[00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:18.720]   Yeah.
[00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:21.920]   I'm just wondering if I just do it.
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:22.920]   We had--
[00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:24.560]   I tried to convince Andrew to do a buzz.
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:25.560]   I was like, just buzz it off.
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:30.240]   It's going to grow back by the time you're in a lightening sponsor coming.
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:34.240]   You perhaps heard of manscaping.
[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:36.960]   And they sent me one of their manscapers.
[00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:40.200]   You're not supposed to use it anywhere above the waist.
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:42.200]   But I think I could.
[00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:46.480]   It might look like a giant testicle.
[00:07:46.480 --> 00:07:47.480]   But other than that--
[00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:51.520]   No, my hair-- I'm going to be able to do a man bun.
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:52.520]   I'm going all the way.
[00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:53.520]   I'm getting there.
[00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:54.520]   I'm going all the way.
[00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:57.760]   Going to have a ponytail, baby.
[00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:58.760]   That is--
[00:07:58.760 --> 00:07:59.760]   Me too.
[00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:01.280]   I don't know what's going to happen.
[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:03.560]   Your hair is shorter than mine right now.
[00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:05.080]   I know the back is a horrendous.
[00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:06.080]   I'm like, oh.
[00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:07.560]   What do you do?
[00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:12.160]   Lisa mentioned that suddenly, in a couple of weeks, everybody's going to--
[00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:14.240]   I'm going to know what everybody's real hair color is.
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:15.560]   Yeah.
[00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:16.560]   Because you can't--
[00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:17.360]   This is mine.
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:18.360]   Well, see?
[00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:19.360]   You're good.
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:20.360]   I thought it was blue.
[00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:21.360]   I thought you were real.
[00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:22.360]   How dare I let it was blue?
[00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:23.360]   No, I took that.
[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:26.120]   I took the blue out, although they did some brown dye over it.
[00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:29.360]   So now it's kind of green.
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:35.040]   I really hate it when you-- yeah, if you don't get the chemicals just right, it can really
[00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:36.760]   fry your hair.
[00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:41.440]   Google has launched a journalist-- this is following in Facebook's footsteps.
[00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:46.040]   Journalism Emergency Relief Fund to support local news.
[00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:47.560]   Jeff, good idea?
[00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:50.560]   Yeah, I'm not-- I'm trying to keep straight all of this.
[00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:55.680]   So it's both the Google News Initiative and Google.org.
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:09:03.000]   So Google.org gave directly to an effort at Columbia and international journalism, something
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   or other.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.280]   I'm forgetting suddenly.
[00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:10.640]   That was part of the 800 million they committed, which is mostly ad breaks, ad deals.
[00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:12.880]   But still, some of it was actual cash.
[00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:16.480]   This one-- so Google has not detailed the exact size of the fund.
[00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:17.760]   This is from 9 to 5 Google.
[00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:26.280]   But earlier this month, committed $6.5 million to fact-checking efforts related to COVID-19.
[00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:30.960]   Applications today will open for local news operations.
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:33.000]   They'll close April 29.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.640]   Reproofable will happen on a rolling basis.
[00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:40.480]   They'll ask for basic information over all organizations and how the funds will be spent.
[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:44.960]   It's available for publications all over the world, Asia Pacific, Europe, Middle East,
[00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:49.080]   Africa, North America, and Latin America.
[00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:53.240]   But not for any Antarctic newspapers.
[00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:58.400]   At a higher level, Google requires that funding goes toward, quote, "original news for local
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:03.680]   communities during this time of crisis, not, for instance, lifestyle, sports."
[00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:07.440]   Although I think sourdough recipes probably would qualify.
[00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:09.960]   I think so, because everybody's doing them.
[00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:14.640]   Actually, there is now the sourdough backlash.
[00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:16.200]   Did you read that?
[00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:17.200]   I did.
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:18.200]   That's silly.
[00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:22.000]   People have been baking and being all fancy about their sourdough forever.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.840]   Yeah, but a lot of us, because we're stuck at home, bread is a little hard to come by,
[00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:31.880]   have taken it up again.
[00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:35.480]   But then there are people saying, "If I have one more sourdough, anything, I'm going
[00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:36.480]   to--"
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:37.480]   I love sourdough.
[00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:38.480]   I love sourdough.
[00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:39.480]   I made sourdough waffles today.
[00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:40.960]   I made sourdough pancakes last week.
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:41.960]   They were fabulous.
[00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:44.800]   Because one of the problems with sourdough, as you feed it, it grows, right?
[00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:45.800]   Stacey, and you get more.
[00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:46.800]   Yeah.
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:47.800]   There's more every day.
[00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:49.440]   Notice everybody, he has Stacey.
[00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:50.600]   He knows I don't know crap.
[00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:52.000]   You don't make sourdough, I could tell.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   You just say sourdough.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   No, I don't.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   Puss.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   We haven't had-- we have kissed it.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   Hey, hey, hey, hey.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   Hey, hey.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.840]   And suddenly, it's like the Cuomo's.
[00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:00.800]   It's like--
[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:01.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:02.800]   Yeah.
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:04.880]   That is the funniest thing to watch.
[00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:10.440]   When her Andrew Cuomo and his brother, Chris Cuomo's CNN show, they are just--
[00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:11.440]   They're awful.
[00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:12.440]   --confused the hell--
[00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:13.440]   European's--
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:15.440]   Well, isn't this an ethical file?
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:19.760]   And why, you know, CNN for years did not allow that.
[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:20.760]   They would--
[00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:24.640]   On Chris's morning show, apparently, which I never watched, but apparently he would have
[00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:28.880]   to step aside and let another anchor do the interview when Governor Cuomo was on.
[00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:31.280]   I think in that case, they're right, but in this case.
[00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:33.160]   Now, it's a different matter.
[00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:35.720]   Chris Cuomo himself has COVID-19.
[00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:39.200]   He's doing his show, isolated in the basement.
[00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:42.240]   It's actually been pretty dramatic watching his ups and downs.
[00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:43.240]   He's had some--
[00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:46.320]   How's he doing lately, you know?
[00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:47.800]   He seems to be getting a little better.
[00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:48.800]   I watched last night.
[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:53.800]   You know, there's a test, I guess, if you go off the NSAIDs, go off the aspirin, they're
[00:11:53.800 --> 00:11:56.520]   the ibuprofen or the Tylenol.
[00:11:56.520 --> 00:12:00.560]   If you can stay fever-free for 72 hours, you're considered--
[00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:03.120]   I don't know if cured is right, but you're considered on the right side.
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:04.440]   He's got a lot of road to recovery.
[00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:06.760]   And he said he tried that and he didn't make it.
[00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:11.960]   He got a fever in the last 10 hours of the 72.
[00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:13.040]   So he's still sick.
[00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:14.040]   It's rough stuff.
[00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:15.040]   It is rough, rough stuff.
[00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:18.280]   And I'm finding out people I didn't know had it had it.
[00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:19.280]   Oh, really?
[00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:20.280]   Yeah, a lot.
[00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:22.640]   You know, they're just suddenly, oh, yeah, you didn't know.
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:24.600]   Someone's only had three horrible weeks.
[00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:25.600]   Well, it isn't--
[00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:29.360]   Like, how did I not talk to a friend for three horrible weeks?
[00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:31.320]   It isn't, and it isn't always horrible.
[00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:33.440]   We still don't know if my son had it.
[00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:37.640]   Came back from Bali on the 28th.
[00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:44.600]   Got sick, went into self-quarantine, got sick a week later.
[00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:46.920]   So that sounds like to me, it's not a cold.
[00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:48.600]   You would have gotten that quicker, right?
[00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:50.120]   But his symptoms sounded like a cold.
[00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:52.920]   He did have a dry cough, did not have a fever.
[00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:53.920]   He had a bad headache.
[00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:57.520]   He had muscle aches and was weak.
[00:12:57.520 --> 00:13:00.320]   So he had some of it, not all of the symptoms.
[00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:01.920]   He has mostly recovered now.
[00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:03.800]   I think he's fully recovered now.
[00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:05.720]   But we could never get him tested.
[00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:06.720]   Yeah.
[00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:08.080]   By the way, how did he get home?
[00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:14.680]   He got a mostly empty flight through Tokyo on United.
[00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:17.320]   Oh, well, wasn't too expensive.
[00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:20.440]   I think they're really cheap now.
[00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:23.320]   They've got a lot cheaper now.
[00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:27.000]   I'm trying to find here.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.760]   So one of my favorite-- so I have my-- I'm going to plug my Twitter
[00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:36.440]   list, my COVID Twitter list, bit.ly/COVID-Twitter list,
[00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:38.360]   where I have more than 500 epidemiologists,
[00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:40.320]   virologists, infectious disease, physicians,
[00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:43.240]   frontline doctors, researchers, NGOs, and a few
[00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:46.840]   is smattering a soup soil of journalists.
[00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:48.840]   So anyway, in my list today, I've got my favorites.
[00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:50.160]   I've got a lot of favorites.
[00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:53.600]   And one of them, Andy Slavitt.
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:14:00.880]   So Andy was ex-Obama health care head.
[00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:03.400]   And he's very outspoken and very smart.
[00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:06.920]   So he went out for a field trip today
[00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:09.080]   and got a-- just to see what it was going to be like,
[00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:10.560]   to get an antibody test.
[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:13.240]   He had no antibodies because he hasn't been sick.
[00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:16.560]   It cost $99 from some company that was just doing it.
[00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:18.480]   Blood test?
[00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:19.560]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:21.000]   So this is-- yeah, because that's the only place
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.600]   the antibodies live is in your bloodstream.
[00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:26.080]   This is something people have talked about
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:27.280]   as being the next step.
[00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:30.320]   But you have to drop blood.
[00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:33.520]   So a home test, as a diabetic, I have no trouble
[00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:35.200]   pricking my finger, getting a drop of blood,
[00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:37.920]   putting it on a test trip, which is what the process is.
[00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:38.960]   So I could do it easily.
[00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:40.760]   But I don't imagine if you've never done that,
[00:14:40.760 --> 00:14:42.560]   it's something you would know how to do.
[00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:45.160]   I grew up with an diabetic, so I'm used to watching it.
[00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:46.440]   And yeah, I'm not present here.
[00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:47.600]   It's not a lot painful, it's not hard.
[00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:49.880]   Do they have the automatic injection things,
[00:14:49.880 --> 00:14:51.840]   where you just go, tuk, and then you tap it?
[00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:54.200]   Or do you have to actually prick yourself with your own pin?
[00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:57.120]   I would imagine that the kit would include a tunker.
[00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:59.400]   Although the tunkers are very easy to use.
[00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:00.880]   Yeah.
[00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:05.040]   I used to-- so our last cat was diabetic in her last year.
[00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:09.360]   So we had to do blood sugars like three times a day with a cat.
[00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:11.600]   So I'm used to thunking cat ears.
[00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:17.200]   We are breaking Jeff Jarvis's four basic editing rules
[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:19.840]   for the crisis.
[00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:22.080]   Because we're pretending to be experts when we're not.
[00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:26.640]   We're just repeating information we've heard somewhere.
[00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:28.240]   Well, this was an interesting case.
[00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:33.240]   So the New York Times had a story about a sloppy lab in Wuhan.
[00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:34.320]   Could this have had an effect?
[00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:35.480]   And da da da da.
[00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:39.520]   And I watch my virologist, an epidemiologist,
[00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:42.320]   and infectious diseases experts in my Twitter list.
[00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:43.880]   Just all of a sudden, as one, they
[00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:46.200]   will rise and go nuts over reporting.
[00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:47.960]   And so they went nuts over this.
[00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:49.440]   And they were right, I think.
[00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:53.920]   Because it was raising suspicion and hackles that wasn't legit.
[00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:56.240]   And they didn't talk to-- it was a story about virology.
[00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:57.680]   And they didn't talk to a virologist.
[00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:58.560]   That's rule one.
[00:15:58.560 --> 00:15:59.160]   If a story--
[00:15:59.160 --> 00:15:59.680]   It's rule one.
[00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:00.400]   --of Jeff Jarvis.
[00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:03.680]   If a story involves virology, demand the reporter
[00:16:03.680 --> 00:16:08.720]   talk with site and listen to a virologist ditto epidemiology.
[00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:10.040]   And that's rule two.
[00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:12.000]   And rule three, don't assign political reporters
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.720]   to science stories.
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:16.400]   I think, unfortunately, I mean, here we
[00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:19.160]   are talking about virology and what masks work.
[00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:20.160]   And it's just critical.
[00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:22.160]   It was like, I am not a virologist, y'all.
[00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:23.280]   I don't think he or others.
[00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:24.280]   Yeah, none of us are.
[00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:27.240]   So we'll stop now with the advice.
[00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:27.800]   Nobody knows.
[00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:29.360]   And rule five.
[00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:33.600]   Rule five, do not show Jeff his tweets in dark mode.
[00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:35.160]   Oh, right.
[00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:36.280]   It's just so much people.
[00:16:36.280 --> 00:16:36.840]   It's so much people.
[00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:38.880]   People.
[00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:39.160]   I don't know.
[00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:41.600]   It hurts my eyes if it's white, if it's light mode.
[00:16:41.600 --> 00:16:43.600]   So Slavitt says just for further information
[00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:47.560]   that there is a wild west of unapproved antibody tests.
[00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:49.760]   The FDA approved ones are hard to get.
[00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:51.080]   He went to see what the experience was
[00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:52.720]   and see what the positive rate was.
[00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:54.200]   And so the issue is going to be pretty soon.
[00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:56.520]   As people are going to insist that they have a piece of paper
[00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:57.560]   and say, I got the antibodies.
[00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:58.080]   I'm safe.
[00:16:58.080 --> 00:16:59.920]   I'm OK.
[00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:03.800]   And we'll see what happens with that.
[00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:08.280]   Yeah, it's going to--
[00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:10.280]   I mean, I'm very curious if we end up
[00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:12.760]   creating incentives over the next few months for people
[00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:16.440]   who are immune, if they are indeed
[00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:20.520]   immune, to go out into the world and have benefits,
[00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:21.960]   which would increase the incentives
[00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:24.000]   would go out and try to get sick so they can go out
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.680]   and continue working.
[00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:28.280]   Although for somebody like my son--
[00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:30.760]   by the way, we still don't know only in anybody test will show.
[00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:34.560]   But if he's hoping he was sick because it was mild,
[00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:35.920]   he survived.
[00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:36.280]   Oh, yeah.
[00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:37.840]   No, if he would be golden, right?
[00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:41.200]   He's imagined there's a guy just got out of college.
[00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:42.600]   What's he going to do?
[00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:44.080]   DoorDash.
[00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:45.480]   Yeah, he can work in an Amazon.
[00:17:45.480 --> 00:17:47.280]   A cart fulfillment center.
[00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:53.160]   But I imagine if you've provably immune--
[00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:55.800]   which again, by the way, that's just because having the antibodies
[00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:57.200]   does not mean necessarily you're immune.
[00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:58.080]   I don't know what--
[00:17:58.080 --> 00:17:58.880]   They don't know now.
[00:17:58.880 --> 00:17:59.840]   How long?
[00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:00.340]   Yeah.
[00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:02.240]   They don't know if they're still a viral load.
[00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:03.240]   There's all kinds of things.
[00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:04.240]   They do not know.
[00:18:04.240 --> 00:18:05.240]   They don't know a lot.
[00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:05.840]   We don't know nothing.
[00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:10.120]   But I mean, he's thinking, I'm going to be golden.
[00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:11.520]   I can get all kinds of jobs.
[00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:12.480]   You probably end up working--
[00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:17.120]   I had no bad news, you probably end up working in the hospital.
[00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:19.160]   OK.
[00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:20.400]   Moving on.
[00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:23.880]   Let's talk about the Google and Apple initiative,
[00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:25.240]   because I think that's very interesting.
[00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:28.280]   But I'm going to preface that with some information
[00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:31.640]   from an actual security expert, our own Steve Gibson, who
[00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:34.680]   spent some time on the show yesterday talking about this.
[00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:35.240]   And he was--
[00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:36.600]   Rule 6.
[00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:38.000]   If you're going to do Australian security,
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   talk to Steve Gibson.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.240]   Yeah, at least because Steve Gibson's taken.
[00:18:43.240 --> 00:18:44.560]   A very interesting idea.
[00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:49.120]   So just the reason why Apple and Google are doing this-- well,
[00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:50.840]   first of all, and I think Steve said this,
[00:18:50.840 --> 00:18:53.080]   and I agree with him, it's nice to see--
[00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:54.400]   or maybe it was somebody on Twitter,
[00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:58.280]   but it was nice to see tech companies more than giving money,
[00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:00.600]   writing a check, helping journalism,
[00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:05.280]   do something actually within their sphere of ability and skill.
[00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:07.360]   Use their magic for good.
[00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:07.880]   Yeah.
[00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:10.120]   So as everybody knows, Google and Apple
[00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:14.000]   have considerable location information.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.520]   Your iPhone and your Android phone both could be used as trackers.
[00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:21.120]   But there are huge privacy concerns doing that.
[00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:24.040]   So Google and Apple also having lots of experience
[00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:27.760]   with protecting privacy and security,
[00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:31.160]   got together and created an API, application programming
[00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:35.160]   interface that could be used by apps from health authorities,
[00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:39.240]   to help in this post-shelter-in-place world
[00:19:39.240 --> 00:19:41.960]   where it's very important once you've detected somebody
[00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:45.280]   has COVID-19 to trace their contacts
[00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:47.200]   so they can all be quarantined.
[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:48.680]   Contact tracing, this is called.
[00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:51.000]   It's part of a containment strategy.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.640]   So they proposed a method to preserve privacy,
[00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:59.560]   but still have this work automatically.
[00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:02.760]   First of all, they propose it to be opt-in.
[00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:04.280]   Of course, once they've created this API,
[00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:07.000]   there's no way they can insist on being opt-in.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.440]   That's not true, actually.
[00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:13.320]   They can control who has access to the API once they create it,
[00:20:13.320 --> 00:20:15.120]   especially because it's at the OS level
[00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:16.200]   that they're going to be doing this.
[00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:16.640]   That's true.
[00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:20.320]   So they could say to developers, if you are not a health--
[00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:23.040]   I don't know if they will, but they could actually say,
[00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:25.600]   yeah, you don't have access to this API.
[00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:26.100]   Sorry.
[00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:26.640]   That's a good point.
[00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:27.140]   Yeah.
[00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:31.640]   So they're going to push out next month to all Android phones.
[00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:34.200]   Google's going to do that through the Google Play Store.
[00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:37.720]   And it will be automatic, and you won't have a choice about that.
[00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:39.200]   It will be through Play Services.
[00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:40.080]   Play Services, I mean.
[00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:40.840]   That's right.
[00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:41.360]   Sorry.
[00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:41.880]   Sorry, Leo.
[00:20:41.880 --> 00:20:42.640]   No, good correction.
[00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:44.480]   No, no, no, no, good correction.
[00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:47.880]   You have Play Services because you have the Play Store on there.
[00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:49.120]   The point being--
[00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:51.200]   It's not an app download.
[00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:54.320]   It's going to just be pushed out as part of services.
[00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:56.760]   It'll be a new service, in effect.
[00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:58.360]   And you talked briefly about location,
[00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:00.440]   but this doesn't actually use location.
[00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:02.240]   And that's what makes it privacy protecting.
[00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:03.760]   It uses Bluetooth.
[00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:06.240]   And it's basically using the Bluetooth network
[00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:08.840]   to ascribe tokens to people.
[00:21:08.840 --> 00:21:11.840]   They're not linking it to the location information.
[00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:12.520]   Right.
[00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:13.960]   Although that is a point of contention,
[00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:15.240]   which we'll get to in a second.
[00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:19.200]   Apple will also be pushing it out mid-month, mid-May,
[00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:21.000]   to their iPhones.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.160]   And then presumably somebody can write an application.
[00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:24.920]   Both Apple and Google say eventually they
[00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:26.720]   will write an application.
[00:21:26.720 --> 00:21:30.360]   The way it works, each device, your device,
[00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:32.960]   will every morning, in the beginning of the day,
[00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:37.720]   create a token that is uniquely identifiable to your device.
[00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:41.160]   And then every 10 minutes--
[00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:44.120]   no, I'm sorry, actually what it really technically is,
[00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:48.200]   is between every 10 and 20 minutes, roughly 15 minutes,
[00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:54.200]   it will generate an additional token using Bluetooth LE.
[00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:57.760]   When you come near another device running this API,
[00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:00.640]   which is presumably every smartphone,
[00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:02.240]   you will exchange these tokens.
[00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:05.720]   So that person will have your token, which
[00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:10.880]   has in it built into it effectively the time of day
[00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:13.840]   that you guys were within 30 feet of each other.
[00:22:13.840 --> 00:22:20.200]   If you test positive, at that point,
[00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:23.120]   you push a button on the phone, or maybe more likely
[00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:25.160]   to prevent pranking.
[00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:27.640]   After you get the test, you'll get a QR code you'll scan
[00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:29.880]   on the phone, or something of that nature.
[00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:31.120]   Ah, OK, thank you.
[00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:31.920]   That's important.
[00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:35.840]   Because they don't want people just to say, yeah, positive.
[00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:38.600]   So you'll have some verified way with a health provider
[00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:40.560]   to say, I'm positive.
[00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:47.480]   Then your phone will take all of the identifiers
[00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:49.800]   of the people you've run into over the last--
[00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:52.040]   I don't know what the period of time is, but something like--
[00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:52.920]   14 days.
[00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:55.240]   14 days, that long?
[00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:56.080]   I believe so, yes.
[00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:56.760]   It needs to be.
[00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:58.240]   You could be--
[00:22:58.240 --> 00:22:59.240]   It's a good idea.
[00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:00.680]   You could be asymptomatic.
[00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:01.960]   It's just, OK.
[00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:02.720]   So 14 days.
[00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:03.920]   Aseptomatic, a presymptomatic.
[00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:04.760]   Yeah.
[00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:07.080]   So for whatever period of time you were contagious
[00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:12.360]   prior to your test, and those tokens will then
[00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:16.080]   be used to send a ping to all of those people's phones,
[00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:19.520]   saying, without any names, naming no names,
[00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:22.000]   you ran into somebody who's COVID positive,
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:23.760]   you need to quarantine.
[00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:26.080]   You won't know when, and you won't know where.
[00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:28.120]   You'll just know that you passed.
[00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:32.320]   The other angle of this to Stacy that I remember reading,
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:34.480]   but I understand.
[00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:38.640]   Your own token changes at some regular rate, right?
[00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:38.960]   Yes.
[00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:42.320]   Your token changes-- everybody's token changes every day.
[00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:43.880]   Every 10 to 20 minutes.
[00:23:43.880 --> 00:23:44.680]   Is it 10 to 20 minutes?
[00:23:44.680 --> 00:23:46.120]   Well, you have two tokens.
[00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:49.160]   So you have your daily token, which is daily, 24 hours.
[00:23:49.160 --> 00:23:52.080]   And you have a 10 to 15 minute token.
[00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:54.560]   That token is important that that change,
[00:23:54.560 --> 00:23:58.520]   because that's how you know you ran into somebody,
[00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:01.760]   because you've got to have those tokens match, so that you go,
[00:24:01.760 --> 00:24:06.960]   oh, yeah, that's the person I was talking to at that time of day.
[00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:07.600]   Right.
[00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:08.480]   Yeah, 14 days.
[00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:09.360]   It says so right there.
[00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:11.840]   You got it, 14 day temporary store.
[00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:14.400]   So a number of people, including Moxie Marlon's bike,
[00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:16.760]   have raised issues, some of which
[00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:20.560]   have been like the prank issue that we just talked about,
[00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:24.520]   have been shot down by Apple in subsequent white papers.
[00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:30.880]   There is some concern that this system could be used by AdTech,
[00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:33.760]   that it could be, you know, surreptitiously,
[00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:36.800]   that there might have to be some personally identifiable
[00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:38.360]   information at some point.
[00:24:38.360 --> 00:24:39.760]   It's changed.
[00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:44.440]   One of the issues that this has is when you test positive
[00:24:44.440 --> 00:24:48.640]   and you say that, you have to put a lock on that token.
[00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:57.680]   So then you're, sorry, you are now linking your magical token,
[00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:00.000]   basically, that no one knows this associated with you,
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.880]   with all of these other tokens.
[00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:06.960]   So it's theoretical that you could go back and figure out
[00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:08.000]   who that person is.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.560]   It's tied to-- and this is--
[00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:13.160]   Moxie mentions this, so does Steve Gibson.
[00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:15.840]   Already, the MAC address of your device
[00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:19.960]   is rotated every 15 minutes on your phone.
[00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:23.280]   Or I don't know what the time period is, roughly every hour
[00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:23.800]   or whatever.
[00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:25.960]   It's rotated on your phone to avoid this precisely
[00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:26.480]   this tracking.
[00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:30.400]   If you had the same MAC address broadcast via Bluetooth LE,
[00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:32.880]   then stores would say, oh, here comes Leo.
[00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:35.280]   But he can't because it's not the same MAC address every time.
[00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:36.080]   Oh, I didn't know that.
[00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:37.080]   So I was--
[00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:38.160]   Something Apple pioneered that, either.
[00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:39.360]   --Apple pioneered that, yeah.
[00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:41.120]   I think it was a really good technique.
[00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:43.760]   I think, actually, the bigger danger is not hacking
[00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:45.000]   or even AdTech.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:47.240]   But it's twofold.
[00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:50.120]   One, for this to be useful, lots of people have to use it,
[00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:51.240]   even in Singapore.
[00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:51.680]   It's voluntary.
[00:25:51.680 --> 00:25:52.680]   The people using the--
[00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:53.180]   Yeah.
[00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:55.880]   The people using the Contact Racing app is not super high.
[00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:57.640]   I think it was less than 20%.
[00:25:57.640 --> 00:25:58.680]   And that's Singapore.
[00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:01.920]   But also, right now, the way it's engineered--
[00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:03.560]   and they could fix this--
[00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:08.360]   because it is using RSSI, so signal strength--
[00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:09.120]   or because-- I'm sorry.
[00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:11.040]   It's just using a binary on/off as opposed
[00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:13.200]   to something like RSSI.
[00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:15.680]   What happens is you don't actually know,
[00:26:15.680 --> 00:26:18.640]   like, if I passed within 30 feet of someone,
[00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:20.160]   I'm probably not--
[00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:21.680]   There's a lot of false positives.
[00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:23.480]   No, there's a lot of false positives.
[00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:26.520]   Now, you could fix that, because with signal strength,
[00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:31.360]   you can say, I spent 30 minutes in the same vicinity,
[00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:32.440]   like 30 feet away.
[00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:34.800]   And I can even say as simple as I was five feet away
[00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:35.400]   from some of the--
[00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:39.320]   So Spertex says it is using RSSI, which is--
[00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:40.520]   Oh, but they're-- OK, so--
[00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:43.080]   but they're not putting that into any sort of score
[00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:45.480]   that helps you understand.
[00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:48.200]   Like, I mean, I guess, yes, that's how you would track
[00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:49.200]   is using RSSI.
[00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:50.360]   It's not--
[00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:54.880]   I mean, one of Steve's points was that you can presume
[00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:57.080]   Apple and Google have thought of all of the things
[00:26:57.080 --> 00:26:59.000]   that you and I are going to think of
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:00.960]   and have built that into the spec.
[00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:02.600]   But, you know, who knows?
[00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:05.320]   But some of those things are hard, like calculating--
[00:27:05.320 --> 00:27:08.240]   so, yes, calculating how long someone's been there
[00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:10.280]   plus how close they were.
[00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:12.080]   That takes a little bit of computing power.
[00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:13.720]   I mean, that's the kind of stuff that's happening
[00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:15.840]   on your phone all the time.
[00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:18.400]   And that's why your cellular modem eats up power.
[00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:21.840]   Well, let's not promote that, because I don't want people
[00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:25.080]   to have any reason not to put it on their phone.
[00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:27.720]   Well, that's the trade-off, is if you--
[00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:31.240]   the more accurate you make this, the more battery consumption
[00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:33.360]   is probably going to consume.
[00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:34.560]   Let's not promote that.
[00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:38.360]   Well, there's that one of you people, any reason not to do this.
[00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:41.440]   And I have a little fit with Ali Velshi, who I consider a friend,
[00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:43.760]   because he did the usual, "Oh, tech,"
[00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:46.400]   and brings on the privacy police.
[00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:49.680]   Well, but I don't have Bluetooth on my phone,
[00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:50.520]   because I have privacy.
[00:27:50.520 --> 00:27:55.760]   And I said, come on, man, priorities, priorities.
[00:27:55.760 --> 00:27:57.760]   But he says he has your--
[00:27:57.760 --> 00:27:59.200]   To add to your question.
[00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:00.480]   Scan results.
[00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:03.360]   I'm reading the white paper from Apple.
[00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:07.920]   Scan results shall be time-stamped and RSSI captured
[00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:09.720]   per advertisement.
[00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:13.920]   So they are going to use signal strength to--
[00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:16.360]   otherwise you get way too many false positives.
[00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:17.360]   Scroll up.
[00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:20.840]   Scanning and rolling windows.
[00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:22.880]   So I have sufficient coverage to discover nearby contact
[00:28:22.880 --> 00:28:26.000]   detection, advertising, service advertisers
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.760]   within five minutes.
[00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:29.840]   It doesn't say anything about distance.
[00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:30.240]   So far--
[00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:32.480]   Yeah, and it doesn't say they're using that data
[00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:34.320]   to actually tell someone-- they're not
[00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:35.760]   saying how they use that data.
[00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:37.440]   They're just saying they use it.
[00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:38.840]   Well, they might later on.
[00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:40.680]   I'm just-- this is one part of it.
[00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:42.880]   So I added something to the chat that kind of addresses too.
[00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:45.560]   That part of the issue here is one of the big fights
[00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:47.120]   in the science world, which I only observed.
[00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:47.840]   I'm not a scientist.
[00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:52.360]   I don't know, is aerosolization.
[00:28:52.360 --> 00:28:53.440]   Is this--
[00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:55.200]   Is this germ aerosolized?
[00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:58.440]   That is to say, snot has gravity.
[00:28:58.440 --> 00:28:58.920]   It's heavy.
[00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:00.040]   It goes only so far.
[00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:01.000]   It goes down.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.840]   Aerosolization is it's still light,
[00:29:02.840 --> 00:29:05.600]   and it can travel farther, longer, and stay in the air.
[00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:08.080]   And you can-- which means you don't necessarily
[00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:10.320]   have to have been near someone for a long time.
[00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:13.040]   They could have moved on.
[00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:14.520]   And interestingly, this paper I just
[00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:18.600]   put up in the chat that was linked to by Eric Topel, who's
[00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:22.600]   one of the people I trust, a physician or author,
[00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:26.000]   says that talking can be as bad as coughing,
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.280]   and volume of speech can make it worse.
[00:29:29.280 --> 00:29:32.120]   So people like me who are allowed are more dangerous.
[00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:34.840]   Well, also-- and I've heard this also--
[00:29:34.840 --> 00:29:37.560]   if you spend 10 minutes sitting across from somebody
[00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:40.880]   talking, that is much more of a problem than if you walk by them.
[00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:46.520]   And I don't know if what provenance is built into this system.
[00:29:46.520 --> 00:29:49.400]   I'm sure it is, but I don't know what it is that would determine
[00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:51.640]   the length of time that you're contacted.
[00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:53.920]   Not just distance, but how long you spent with this person.
[00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:54.360]   All of that's relevant.
[00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:56.240]   They're just trying to increase--
[00:29:56.240 --> 00:29:59.800]   it's the same as my wife going to the store.
[00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:03.520]   We've decreased our contact with other people hugely,
[00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:04.920]   but all it takes is one.
[00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:07.600]   So just do you have fewer ones?
[00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:09.640]   And in this case, certain number of people
[00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:10.920]   aren't going to use this.
[00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:12.880]   And it's going to be false in some cases.
[00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:15.800]   OK, so this is reducing some cases.
[00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:16.280]   Does it increase--
[00:30:16.280 --> 00:30:18.040]   You want to get your RNA crease DR?
[00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:21.360]   If you get the RNA down below one, doesn't have to be perfect.
[00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:25.040]   It has to be below one to eliminate the virus.
[00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:29.800]   As long as each person is infecting one or fewer people,
[00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:32.600]   you don't have the geometric growth that we have right now
[00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:33.400]   that's problematic.
[00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:33.600]   So--
[00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:34.480]   Am I a stupid way to put it?
[00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:35.440]   It's like fuzzy logic.
[00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:37.160]   You're close enough, right?
[00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:38.240]   You're not being exact.
[00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:39.200]   You don't need to be exact.
[00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:41.280]   In other words, if it's good, that's good.
[00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:42.920]   It doesn't have to be perfect.
[00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:49.160]   So Steve's basic point was having read all the white papers
[00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:52.000]   and digested all the information that he
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.400]   feels this is a very good system.
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:55.200]   Yay.
[00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:58.800]   And it's effective and it is sufficiently private.
[00:30:58.800 --> 00:31:01.160]   And that's what I would expect from both Google and Apple,
[00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:02.520]   is something like that.
[00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:04.800]   There is this issue of if it's voluntary.
[00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:06.760]   Now it doesn't--
[00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:09.880]   I mean, honestly, it doesn't have to be voluntary.
[00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:12.040]   If the government decides to put out an app and say,
[00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:13.880]   you must download it and use it.
[00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:16.280]   And if we see your phone doesn't have it,
[00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:17.680]   we're going to have the right to check it.
[00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:19.520]   There's nothing to say that that can't happen.
[00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:22.000]   So just because Google and Apple say it's voluntary,
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:23.760]   doesn't mean it will always be voluntary.
[00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:24.920]   And let me know, share this with you.
[00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:26.720]   But also, I want to say one more thing.
[00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:29.480]   I think people will do it.
[00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:30.720]   I think people will do it.
[00:31:30.720 --> 00:31:31.120]   Look at--
[00:31:31.120 --> 00:31:31.480]   I hope so.
[00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:33.200]   Look at-- it's not 100%, but look
[00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:35.120]   how much compliance you're getting right now
[00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:38.600]   in an extremely painful way.
[00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:40.160]   Yeah, but you know what, Leo?
[00:31:40.160 --> 00:31:42.320]   Here you've got a couple things working.
[00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:47.760]   You've got anti-tech and anti-big company
[00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:50.880]   and privacy fetishism and a moral panic.
[00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:51.360]   No.
[00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:52.040]   I don't think so.
[00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:53.000]   Having an influence.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:53.840]   I think people will do it.
[00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:55.360]   You're going to have some number of people.
[00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:55.720]   Sure.
[00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:58.160]   If God thinks people who won't vaccinate their children
[00:31:58.160 --> 00:31:58.560]   against you--
[00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:01.280]   Do you have people going to parties, of course.
[00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:01.800]   Search.
[00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:02.280]   But--
[00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:04.920]   I do think it will be harder to get people to adopt this
[00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:06.600]   than to adopt social distancing.
[00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:09.280]   Because you find it, yes, because social distancing--
[00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:11.200]   You're going to say no.
[00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:14.560]   Well, there's an element of shame in social policing
[00:32:14.560 --> 00:32:15.920]   associated with this, whereas no one
[00:32:15.920 --> 00:32:18.200]   knows if you have the app on your phone.
[00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:18.800]   We don't know.
[00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:19.480]   We'll see.
[00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:20.280]   It's going to happen.
[00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:21.160]   They're going to put this out.
[00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:22.480]   They're going to put it on an app.
[00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:25.280]   I don't know if health officials will embrace this or not.
[00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:25.720]   But--
[00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:26.880]   Are they putting out an app?
[00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:27.920]   Or are they waiting for help?
[00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:28.680]   That will make a question.
[00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:31.040]   Yeah, where are the apps themselves coming from?
[00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:33.720]   The apps are supposed to come from health--
[00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:35.600]   like public health agencies or--
[00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:36.280]   Initially.
[00:32:36.280 --> 00:32:37.680]   Possibly hospitals?
[00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:39.600]   Initially.
[00:32:39.600 --> 00:32:42.680]   Unless I misread, Apple says--
[00:32:42.680 --> 00:32:43.080]   Why would Apple--
[00:32:43.080 --> 00:32:44.080]   Later this year--
[00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:46.880]   What about a universal app?
[00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:49.480]   Well, because I don't actually want Google and Apple
[00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:49.920]   to have this--
[00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:51.400]   Let me finish reading this.
[00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:53.320]   Later this year, iOS and Android--
[00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:55.840]   So starting in mid-May, the API be out.
[00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:56.920]   Apps can use it.
[00:32:56.920 --> 00:32:59.200]   Those apps coming from, presumably, health authorities,
[00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:00.640]   not Apple and Google.
[00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:02.160]   Later this year--
[00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:03.400]   Don't know when that is--
[00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:07.040]   iOS and Android will receive updates that will let users opt
[00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:11.440]   into contact tracing without installing an app.
[00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:12.880]   OK.
[00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:14.840]   So there is going--
[00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:17.480]   If there's going to be an app, that would have to come
[00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:19.400]   from health officials.
[00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:22.360]   But you won't need an app at some point later this year.
[00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:24.200]   We don't know when that is.
[00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:27.000]   In the data from this that Google and Apple get,
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:28.200]   are they going to keep it?
[00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:29.240]   Are they going to donate it?
[00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:30.240]   Are they going to delete it?
[00:33:30.240 --> 00:33:31.360]   What's the policy there?
[00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:33.160]   Because that's another important question.
[00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:35.840]   Their point is there's no personally identifiable information
[00:33:35.840 --> 00:33:36.760]   in the data.
[00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:38.720]   The system is set up so that your name--
[00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:39.680]   I understand.
[00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:40.960]   None of that is attached.
[00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:45.320]   So what if Google and Apple get it?
[00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:49.800]   Because if they have that data tied with my location--
[00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:51.160]   But they don't know it's your location.
[00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:52.800]   They get a bunch of identifiers.
[00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:55.400]   But they have an address to the phone, right?
[00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:56.440]   It's not built into that.
[00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:57.680]   No, it's not built into that.
[00:33:57.680 --> 00:33:58.360]   No.
[00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:02.080]   In theory-- and Moxie Marlon's bike was concerned about this.
[00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:05.320]   But Steve said, no, I don't think so.
[00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:09.040]   In theory, there is no PII associated in any way
[00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:11.920]   with either that daily number or the rolling number.
[00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:14.240]   Stacey, they did vow that they would use this data
[00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:15.240]   for nothing else.
[00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:16.680]   Now, is there an audit of that?
[00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:17.880]   Is there-- I'm sure--
[00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:20.040]   I don't think they gave out verily
[00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:23.760]   which they launched their COVID testing tracker thing
[00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:24.560]   through Verily.
[00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:28.120]   And they did not have a privacy policy that
[00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:30.840]   precluded that data being used by Google for other things.
[00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:31.320]   I think--
[00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:32.160]   So that's--
[00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:32.520]   I thought they did.
[00:34:32.520 --> 00:34:34.320]   They've added it though, I think.
[00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:36.800]   They said to Congress that they were not going to use it.
[00:34:36.800 --> 00:34:37.320]   Right.
[00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:39.080]   And they argued, I think, properly that they
[00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:40.680]   had to use Google Sign-In because they wanted
[00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:45.880]   to be sure of the identities that they were working with.
[00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:47.840]   Yeah.
[00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:50.440]   No, I think there's a good point there.
[00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:51.920]   Because there's also liability.
[00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:54.360]   I think this is intentionally designed
[00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:57.880]   so that there is no information that they could use.
[00:34:57.880 --> 00:35:00.760]   What Moxie said, what his concern was
[00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:03.920]   that there could some retro matching could be used
[00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:07.480]   or this technology could be used by illicitly by AdTech.
[00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:10.360]   But this isn't, I think, very consciously being designed
[00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:13.760]   because of that objection, not to have any PII
[00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:15.400]   in the actual numbers.
[00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:18.840]   So what's fun about this then is, by gosh,
[00:35:18.840 --> 00:35:23.840]   we could do a lot more privacy-focused app designs.
[00:35:23.840 --> 00:35:25.880]   Absolutely.
[00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:26.680]   Absolutely.
[00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:27.920]   And I think Apple does do that.
[00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:30.480]   They have something they call differential privacy,
[00:35:30.480 --> 00:35:31.880]   which, in theory, although there's
[00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:37.080]   some debate over this as well, ensures the privacy.
[00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:42.320]   So there is some question about how widespread this used to be.
[00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:43.880]   I am going to go on record saying,
[00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:46.440]   I think it'll be very widespread.
[00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:47.440]   I think you'll be surprised.
[00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:48.440]   I hope it will be.
[00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:51.080]   And-- but here's another question.
[00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:56.920]   Could you imagine, so I have the app.
[00:35:56.920 --> 00:35:58.840]   I want to brag about the app.
[00:35:58.840 --> 00:35:59.720]   I want to push the app.
[00:35:59.720 --> 00:36:00.840]   I want to say, look at me, folks.
[00:36:00.840 --> 00:36:01.560]   I got the app.
[00:36:01.560 --> 00:36:03.160]   I'm a good good guy, right?
[00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:03.600]   What do I do?
[00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:07.040]   Start walking around with a phone like this with the app up.
[00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:09.560]   Do I get a little Bluetooth badge that only works with it?
[00:36:09.560 --> 00:36:10.880]   If it says, yes, he has the app?
[00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:14.240]   I mean, what can we imagine that would say, yep,
[00:36:14.240 --> 00:36:15.560]   Jarvis is a good guy.
[00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:18.520]   He's got the app.
[00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:20.080]   Yeah.
[00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:22.280]   I think there'll be some peer pressure.
[00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:23.720]   Could you write an app that points out?
[00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:25.240]   You can put a Twitter--
[00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:28.840]   you can change your Twitter avatar to, I got the app.
[00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:29.800]   I think there'll be things--
[00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:32.720]   Could you do an app that beeps at you
[00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:35.160]   if you're around people who have phones and Bluetooth on
[00:36:35.160 --> 00:36:37.000]   but don't have the app?
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.160]   Uh, no.
[00:36:39.160 --> 00:36:41.280]   That's going to drive people nuts.
[00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:41.600]   I know.
[00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:42.880]   I'm just being--
[00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:47.280]   No, I'm like, oh, I guess you could.
[00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:51.560]   I honestly-- maybe this is stupid of me.
[00:36:51.560 --> 00:36:54.440]   And certainly, I'm glad that we would talk about the pros
[00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:55.480]   and cons.
[00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:58.760]   I don't want to push too many hypothetical privacy concerns
[00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:03.160]   around this because I think it's important that people do
[00:37:03.160 --> 00:37:04.080]   this.
[00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:06.200]   I'm not worried about hypothetical privacy.
[00:37:06.200 --> 00:37:08.680]   I was mostly worried about hypothetical false positives
[00:37:08.680 --> 00:37:10.560]   and a false sense of security.
[00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:11.360]   And I--
[00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:14.280]   Well, that's up to the health officials to worry about.
[00:37:14.280 --> 00:37:15.120]   That's not--
[00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:15.960]   Let's be clear here.
[00:37:15.960 --> 00:37:18.640]   This is merely an aid.
[00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:23.520]   We have to have human contact tracers, thousands of them.
[00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:25.480]   It is test trace isolate.
[00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:26.680]   Test trace isolate.
[00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:28.280]   This is not tracing.
[00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:32.280]   This merely adds in another layer.
[00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:33.280]   It's not--
[00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:33.640]   It is not--
[00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:36.000]   It is not contact tracing.
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:37.440]   Contact tracing series--
[00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:39.680]   If everybody had a smartphone, it would be.
[00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:43.600]   Even then, contact tracing, properly done,
[00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:47.960]   is going to be, I get it, and I tell the tracer where
[00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:50.920]   all I was the last 14 days and who I had contact with.
[00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:51.400]   I think it's--
[00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:52.880]   By name, so they can be called--
[00:37:52.880 --> 00:37:55.640]   I think that's going to be less accurate than the automated
[00:37:55.640 --> 00:37:56.320]   system in your phone.
[00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:57.200]   It all adds up.
[00:37:57.200 --> 00:38:00.200]   It's all about reducing the load, trying to get--
[00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:03.000]   is more the people who've been exposed isolated
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:05.400]   to reduce the R0, right?
[00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:08.160]   And that's-- and again, I'm no epidemiologist,
[00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:10.080]   but I'm reading a lot about this stuff.
[00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:11.360]   And that's what people will say.
[00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:12.920]   It's not going to be a perfect system.
[00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:18.240]   But without human contact tracers who are trained to do this,
[00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:20.280]   this will work.
[00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:21.000]   This is not sufficient.
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:21.960]   I wouldn't be willing to say that.
[00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:23.000]   Don't roll, it's a sufficient.
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:24.960]   I wouldn't be willing to say that either.
[00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:28.560]   Well, even though Apple and Google say this, they say this is not--
[00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:32.440]   the main lead at Apple says this is not sufficient.
[00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:34.960]   This is an aid.
[00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:35.960]   OK.
[00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:36.960]   Listen to me.
[00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:38.880]   I'm the Mr. Tech Optimist.
[00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:41.160]   Tech will not solve this.
[00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:45.600]   This requires human investment and human effort.
[00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:46.600]   Well, I'm just--
[00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:48.040]   I absolutely hope they do that.
[00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:51.920]   But they have to know the one they're starting, right?
[00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:54.400]   The smart governors, Massachusetts
[00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:56.800]   has started hiring contract tracers.
[00:38:56.800 --> 00:39:01.760]   New York is going to start hiring in the East Coast cabal.
[00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:08.280]   And until you have sufficient testing at scale and contact tracing
[00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:14.360]   with reliability and you isolate people who were exposed,
[00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:15.960]   there's no reopening.
[00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:17.000]   It's BS.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.720]   Because the only thing that's different between now and a week
[00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:23.520]   ago is that my odds of being refused to ventilator went down.
[00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:24.240]   That's it.
[00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:26.520]   Everything else about what was going on is still there.
[00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:29.680]   I can still get sick just as easily as I could last week,
[00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:31.280]   and I can still die just as easily
[00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:31.960]   I did last week.
[00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:34.160]   And people have to take this very serious.
[00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:36.080]   Says an old guy who's vulnerable.
[00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:38.760]   And contact tracing is being pursued in some countries
[00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:40.360]   now with some success.
[00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:41.520]   Yes, that's where it works.
[00:39:41.520 --> 00:39:42.280]   Yeah.
[00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:42.680]   Right.
[00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:44.800]   South Korea and Taiwan name.
[00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:45.920]   So do you agree?
[00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:50.280]   I don't want to hear BS privacy new discussion.
[00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:52.600]   I don't want to hear battery discussion.
[00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:55.400]   I want to hear that this is a generous social act
[00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:57.800]   that you do as a responsible member of society.
[00:39:57.800 --> 00:39:59.480]   And I don't know about you guys.
[00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:00.480]   I won't speak to you guys.
[00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:01.280]   But I understand.
[00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:03.520]   I will run it the minute I can.
[00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:04.280]   I will too.
[00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:05.440]   I will too.
[00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:06.360]   Eagerly and gladly.
[00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:08.160]   And I'll brag about it.
[00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:11.440]   And as Governor Cuomo, as President Cuomo,
[00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:15.280]   as I like to call him now, said to do you really
[00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:17.480]   want President Cuomo?
[00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:19.560]   As a New Yorker, as a New York City person,
[00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:21.120]   I'm trained to dislike him.
[00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:23.360]   But now we will be spellable.
[00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:25.600]   So as he said today, in his briefing today,
[00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:26.960]   he required the mask.
[00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:28.880]   He said, listen, you come to a street corner
[00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:30.040]   and it's social pressure.
[00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:32.840]   You see somebody with on a mask, you say, yo, where's your mask?
[00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:34.240]   What about the mask, buddy?
[00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:35.640]   Yeah, Paul Thorett was talking--
[00:40:35.640 --> 00:40:36.560]   I had a good New Yorker one.
[00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:38.360]   Talking earlier on Windows Weekly,
[00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:40.960]   he had ordered a meal at a restaurant,
[00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:44.560]   went to the restaurant to pick it up,
[00:40:44.560 --> 00:40:46.600]   as one does, to be safe.
[00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:47.720]   And nobody was wearing a mask.
[00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:50.480]   And he said, I saw red.
[00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:52.080]   I started yelling at him.
[00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:54.280]   They thought I was mad because the order was late or something.
[00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:57.640]   He said, no, you're not wearing masks.
[00:40:57.640 --> 00:40:59.480]   I can't eat food.
[00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:01.600]   If you're not going to wear masks.
[00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:03.840]   You haven't done any takeout at all.
[00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:05.200]   None.
[00:41:05.200 --> 00:41:07.720]   You have-- Lisa got you a nice meal.
[00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:09.480]   Stay safe, you don't takeout?
[00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:11.480]   We do takeout once a week.
[00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:12.120]   Once a week, yeah, that's right.
[00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:13.440]   You said makeout.
[00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:14.480]   I had a burrito.
[00:41:14.480 --> 00:41:15.480]   That's our late.
[00:41:15.480 --> 00:41:17.280]   Yay.
[00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:18.320]   You know what I want?
[00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:19.320]   You know what I want?
[00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:20.480]   Where did it go?
[00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:20.840]   What?
[00:41:20.840 --> 00:41:22.200]   A bagel.
[00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:23.280]   No, Taco Bell.
[00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:24.680]   Oh, yeah, you said that on the AMA.
[00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:28.320]   And Lisa said, by the way, she agrees.
[00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:29.320]   Tell Jeff--
[00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:30.320]   Wow.
[00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:31.320]   --I love the food.
[00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:32.320]   Tell Jeff I am him.
[00:41:32.320 --> 00:41:34.320]   His answer is in the AMA match mine.
[00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:37.320]   I want to go to the alcohol Taco Bell.
[00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:38.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:42.320]   Because you want to-- you said Taco Bell would be fine if they had drinks.
[00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:46.600]   A crock of all-- no, across the street from my school, they have a Taco Bell cantina,
[00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:49.600]   which has alcoholic beverages, which is the saddest thing I can imagine.
[00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:52.440]   Hey, let's go to Taco Bell and get tanked.
[00:41:52.440 --> 00:41:56.000]   So here's the deal about that.
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   Yeah.
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:00.080]   So Taco Cabana, which is in Texas--
[00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:02.520]   I don't know, it's got to be other places too.
[00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:03.520]   They sold alcohol.
[00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:07.080]   They were like, Taco Bell, this sold alcohol with better tortillas too.
[00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:09.760]   And they had their thing across from the University of Texas.
[00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:13.880]   That's where you would go when you were 18 and you didn't want to be carted.
[00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:20.920]   So a lot of these places, I think you can kind of ease in and be like, hey.
[00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:23.120]   So you would go out and drink margaritas there.
[00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:29.440]   And it was not optimal.
[00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:35.640]   Ah, by the way, she says, there's a whole text message chain going on behind the scenes
[00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:36.640]   now.
[00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:40.480]   Lisa says she's taking you there the next time we're in New York City.
[00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:41.480]   Amen.
[00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:42.480]   Amen.
[00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:44.640]   I can't wait.
[00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:45.640]   In about three years?
[00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:46.640]   Four years?
[00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:47.640]   I don't know.
[00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:48.640]   I think so.
[00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:49.640]   Yes.
[00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:53.520]   I'm stuck inside for at least a year.
[00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:59.120]   Well, Jeff and I are vulnerable populations, so we have to be extra careful.
[00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:00.120]   Yep.
[00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:01.120]   Yeah.
[00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:04.760]   All those times you've made fun of us for being old Stacy, you're going to be sorry.
[00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:05.760]   I'm sorry.
[00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:12.080]   I don't call it "buma remover" for nothing.
[00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:15.160]   I'll never forgive or forget your daughter for that.
[00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:17.120]   No, I'll forgive her.
[00:43:17.120 --> 00:43:18.120]   It's her.
[00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:19.120]   She doesn't say it.
[00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:20.120]   I think it's hysterical.
[00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:21.120]   I love it.
[00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:22.400]   She's, yeah, you're too.
[00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:24.160]   She's reporting the zeitgeist.
[00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:25.160]   Yeah.
[00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:26.160]   Yeah.
[00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:27.160]   And you know what?
[00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:30.120]   If I were those kids, I'd be real pissed right now.
[00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:33.440]   I mean, they've got a lot to be angry about.
[00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:34.440]   So yeah.
[00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:35.440]   Oh, yeah.
[00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:36.440]   Oh, yeah.
[00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:43.800]   More Google, good Google news, Google classroom, taking Italy's school system online after
[00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:53.880]   quote, several sleepless days, Javier Soltero, the VP in charge of G Suite, said he got
[00:43:53.880 --> 00:43:59.640]   an email in March from his team in Europe with an inquiry from Italy's Minister of Education
[00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:06.800]   asking if Google's platform could take the entire country's school system online immediately.
[00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:08.320]   Several sleepless days and nights later.
[00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:10.080]   That's a gulp at a spit take.
[00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:11.080]   Yeah.
[00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:12.560]   The whole country.
[00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:15.520]   The service was up and running for millions of children in Italy.
[00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:18.240]   Classroom is, of course, really widely used, I think.
[00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:19.240]   Oh, yeah.
[00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:22.400]   My daughter's been in two different schools and they both use classroom.
[00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:25.760]   Classroom and Zoom.
[00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:27.520]   So that's good.
[00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:30.440]   Google jumping, leaping into the fray.
[00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:32.440]   There.
[00:44:32.440 --> 00:44:35.120]   Let's see.
[00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:36.120]   Google did be--
[00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:37.120]   Oh, yeah, we have one down.
[00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:38.120]   I forgot.
[00:44:38.120 --> 00:44:39.120]   Yeah.
[00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:40.120]   Oh, why don't we talk about anything you want?
[00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:41.120]   You know the room.
[00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:42.120]   Can we talk about the chairs?
[00:44:42.120 --> 00:44:43.120]   Sorry.
[00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:44.120]   I got excited.
[00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:45.120]   The dog got excited.
[00:44:45.120 --> 00:44:46.120]   We're all excited.
[00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:47.120]   Yeah, let's talk about the chips.
[00:44:47.120 --> 00:44:48.120]   Hold on.
[00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:50.440]   The dog is going.
[00:44:50.440 --> 00:44:52.040]   It's being banished.
[00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:53.600]   No, the dog says nevermind.
[00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:54.600]   Oh, chips?
[00:44:54.600 --> 00:44:55.760]   You said there were chips?
[00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:56.760]   What chips?
[00:44:56.760 --> 00:44:59.000]   I'm in the-- are they Fritos?
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   What kind of chips?
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   Sorry.
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:03.080]   She was-- I was excited.
[00:45:03.080 --> 00:45:04.080]   She gets excited.
[00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:05.080]   She did.
[00:45:05.080 --> 00:45:06.080]   It was so cute.
[00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:07.240]   She's very tuned to you.
[00:45:07.240 --> 00:45:08.240]   That is true.
[00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:09.240]   OK.
[00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:10.240]   Can we talk about chips?
[00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:11.240]   Yes, I'm going to see any of the--
[00:45:11.240 --> 00:45:12.240]   No, no, no, no.
[00:45:12.240 --> 00:45:14.600]   --you're going to have a handker in to talk about.
[00:45:14.600 --> 00:45:16.880]   Well, it's even Google related you guys.
[00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:22.200]   So the stories are out saying that Google is going to build its own processors for--
[00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:23.200]   I know, it's not.
[00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:24.200]   --pro books and phones.
[00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:25.600]   Yeah, I thought that was very interesting.
[00:45:25.600 --> 00:45:27.600]   Right now they're-- oh, sorry.
[00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:28.600]   What was that, Leo?
[00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:29.600]   I thought that was very interesting.
[00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:31.560]   Are they disenchanted with Qualcomm?
[00:45:31.560 --> 00:45:32.560]   Qualcomm?
[00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:33.560]   Yeah.
[00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:36.000]   Who isn't disenchanted with Qualcomm?
[00:45:36.000 --> 00:45:44.200]   It's also having a highly integrated hardware software and platform is good.
[00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:45.200]   I mean, Apple's--
[00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:46.200]   Apple's doing it.
[00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:49.880]   --differentiated the iPhone quite a bit because of its own stuff.
[00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:51.880]   So this will be optimized.
[00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:55.480]   They're calling the chip is code named Whitechapel.
[00:45:55.480 --> 00:45:59.040]   Looks like it might be based-- it's an ARM-based processor.
[00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:03.920]   Axios is-- you know, over at Axios, she's delicious.
[00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:04.920]   No.
[00:46:04.920 --> 00:46:07.000]   --is accurate.
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:09.480]   I don't know where the delicious game from.
[00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:15.400]   Says that it's going to be using Samsung's 5 nanometer process, which means very--
[00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:16.560]   Far over it.
[00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:17.080]   --far.
[00:46:17.080 --> 00:46:18.080]   I know.
[00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:19.080]   Far.
[00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:22.840]   Although I had read-- and I'm not an expert in this-- that Samsung--
[00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:27.080]   that using 5 is a little bit of a misnomer.
[00:46:27.080 --> 00:46:28.920]   Yeah, there's some fudging there.
[00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:33.160]   And I can't remember if Samsung is using EUV or how they're getting that far down
[00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:34.760]   on their process note.
[00:46:34.760 --> 00:46:36.480]   But that's at the point--
[00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:39.040]   Is an Intel still stuck at 10 nanometers twice?
[00:46:39.040 --> 00:46:42.760]   Yeah, they're like 10, 11.
[00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:47.200]   Well, you know, in the 15 years of Twit here, we're just going to interject here.
[00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:52.520]   I remember when geeky discussions were like, what inputs there were on the back of a monitor?
[00:46:52.520 --> 00:46:54.720]   And now you guys are doing chip nanometers.
[00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:56.360]   I am so impressed.
[00:46:56.360 --> 00:46:58.840]   I bow before you.
[00:46:58.840 --> 00:46:59.680]   Keep going.
[00:46:59.680 --> 00:47:01.240]   Thanks to Stacey.
[00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:02.920]   That was more claw.
[00:47:02.920 --> 00:47:07.080]   I mean, this is how we kept working.
[00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:08.480]   In fact, for a long time--
[00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:14.240]   As I remember, 5 nanometers was considered the limit of Moore's law,
[00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:16.640]   that it couldn't go any smaller than that.
[00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:18.160]   Because of quantum quantum mechanics.
[00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:21.400]   Yeah, 7 was really kind of where I thought we were.
[00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:23.280]   So this was surprising to me.
[00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:27.080]   But Kevin, I'll tell you over and about Chromebooks, talked about this.
[00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:29.080]   And he said he had heard about it about a week ago,
[00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:31.080]   but he was waiting for a second confirmation.
[00:47:31.080 --> 00:47:32.400]   So he was kind of like, ah.
[00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:34.920]   He's so good, Kevin.
[00:47:34.920 --> 00:47:35.480]   I know.
[00:47:35.480 --> 00:47:36.440]   Sometimes you get it.
[00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:38.080]   Sometimes you don't.
[00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:44.160]   But he doesn't think they're going to be used for a Chromebook.
[00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:46.960]   Because he doesn't see Google really focusing on using
[00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:49.080]   ARM-based processors for Chromebooks.
[00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:53.440]   So this may be just for the phone.
[00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:58.720]   And it's going to have a Google Visual Core and Neural Processing Unit,
[00:47:58.720 --> 00:48:02.240]   which is kind of exciting because that means we should see a lot more
[00:48:02.240 --> 00:48:05.120]   AI capabilities on the device itself.
[00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:06.720]   And yeah, and it's called Whitechapel.
[00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:08.240]   That was the other thing.
[00:48:08.240 --> 00:48:13.160]   And Stacy, do I presume that Google--
[00:48:13.160 --> 00:48:19.040]   you trust Google with chips because they make hot, doggy,
[00:48:19.040 --> 00:48:20.440]   silver stuff and all that.
[00:48:20.440 --> 00:48:22.480]   They'd be good at this.
[00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:24.360]   So yeah, Google-- Google's had chip ambition.
[00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:26.200]   So I don't like dumb to that down to my level.
[00:48:26.200 --> 00:48:27.240]   You just hire people.
[00:48:27.240 --> 00:48:28.920]   Jeff, that's all.
[00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:31.400]   Yeah, they hire people from chip firms.
[00:48:31.400 --> 00:48:35.840]   And they've done their TensorFlow TPUs.
[00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:36.320]   Right.
[00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:37.320]   The hot, tickety, dog.
[00:48:37.320 --> 00:48:39.200]   And they don't make them.
[00:48:39.200 --> 00:48:40.920]   They just spec them.
[00:48:40.920 --> 00:48:43.400]   Well, OK, it's a little bit more than just spec you.
[00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:48.000]   What they're doing is they're taking an existing processor design.
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:50.920]   So Intel's is x86-based architecture.
[00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:54.320]   ARM has variations of their ARM architecture.
[00:48:54.320 --> 00:48:57.480]   And they'll take a license to that core.
[00:48:57.480 --> 00:48:59.200]   When you take a license to a certain core,
[00:48:59.200 --> 00:49:00.760]   that means you can actually re-jigger it,
[00:49:00.760 --> 00:49:04.600]   as opposed to just produce the exact license.
[00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:08.000]   So it's called an architecture license.
[00:49:08.000 --> 00:49:11.720]   Google took that architecture license a decade ago.
[00:49:11.720 --> 00:49:13.640]   So they have been working on building chips
[00:49:13.640 --> 00:49:14.400]   and playing around with it.
[00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:15.880]   Oh, I think they had an architecture license that long.
[00:49:15.880 --> 00:49:17.160]   That's interesting.
[00:49:17.160 --> 00:49:17.920]   So this is always--
[00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:19.560]   Everybody took an architecture license a while back
[00:49:19.560 --> 00:49:21.840]   because they wanted to do it for their own servers.
[00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:25.960]   So Microsoft has one, Amazon has them.
[00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:28.000]   So that's instead of letting ARM design the chip,
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:31.200]   you have the right to design the chip around ARM ideas.
[00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:34.360]   It's almost like a patent license, really.
[00:49:34.360 --> 00:49:36.000]   Honestly, it would be irresponsible
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:40.640]   if they haven't been working on this because when you have--
[00:49:40.640 --> 00:49:42.640]   and what's a little weird about this, though,
[00:49:42.640 --> 00:49:46.160]   is Google is not successful at the level
[00:49:46.160 --> 00:49:49.440]   that Apple is successful at selling devices.
[00:49:49.440 --> 00:49:51.960]   For Apple, it makes sense to invest a lot
[00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:55.200]   in developing a custom chip in architecture,
[00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:56.960]   or a custom chip for themselves.
[00:49:56.960 --> 00:49:59.160]   Because they sell so many iPhones.
[00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:01.320]   Google's using this on a pixel.
[00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:02.440]   They don't sell that many.
[00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:08.200]   So that's the only part of this that I'm like,
[00:50:08.200 --> 00:50:11.360]   does this really make sense?
[00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:12.720]   Now, it says that Google's actually
[00:50:12.720 --> 00:50:15.880]   using Samsung's Exynos chips that Samsung developed.
[00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:18.360]   So maybe if it's going to go in every single type of Android
[00:50:18.360 --> 00:50:20.680]   phone, then that makes a little bit more sense
[00:50:20.680 --> 00:50:23.560]   because then the economy's a scale makes sense.
[00:50:23.560 --> 00:50:25.920]   I'm saying makes sense a lot.
[00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:28.200]   So that's kind of a little-- when I saw this,
[00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:29.880]   I was like, about damn time.
[00:50:29.880 --> 00:50:31.720]   And then I was like, wait a second.
[00:50:31.720 --> 00:50:32.400]   And I was like, OK.
[00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:37.080]   About damn time.
[00:50:37.080 --> 00:50:40.240]   Yeah, I think it's a purely non-technical,
[00:50:40.240 --> 00:50:42.920]   but purely marketing point of view.
[00:50:42.920 --> 00:50:43.760]   It's very interesting.
[00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:46.080]   It says you point out Apple's done very well
[00:50:46.080 --> 00:50:48.400]   having custom chips and custom silicon.
[00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:51.840]   And I think, especially lately, Qualcomm has--
[00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:55.520]   just as Intel has disappointed PC manufacturers
[00:50:55.520 --> 00:50:58.560]   by being slow to market with improved chips,
[00:50:58.560 --> 00:51:02.880]   Qualcomm has really kind of stalled some of their production.
[00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:06.560]   And I think a lot of phone companies are a little disappointed.
[00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:09.640]   And now the new Qualcomm chip is being used in some phones.
[00:51:09.640 --> 00:51:12.000]   What is it, the 855?
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:13.320]   Is that it?
[00:51:13.320 --> 00:51:14.320]   The new Snapdragon.
[00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:16.480]   I can't remember the designation.
[00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:19.640]   But I do remember-- and again, it's just dim memory--
[00:51:19.640 --> 00:51:21.040]   that there were issues.
[00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:23.840]   People were just unhappy a little bit with--
[00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:26.480]   I think part of it is Qualcomm--
[00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:28.760]   when you buy the Qualcomm application processor,
[00:51:28.760 --> 00:51:31.240]   you're also getting a Qualcomm modal, whether or not you want one.
[00:51:31.240 --> 00:51:32.240]   Right.
[00:51:32.240 --> 00:51:33.800]   Get it all, baby.
[00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:34.920]   Yeah.
[00:51:34.920 --> 00:51:35.680]   I think there's--
[00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:37.720]   Qualcomm has announced five nanometer chips,
[00:51:37.720 --> 00:51:41.200]   so they're going to do it too.
[00:51:41.200 --> 00:51:43.200]   Oh, yeah.
[00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:45.880]   The reason I mentioned that they were using five nanometers
[00:51:45.880 --> 00:51:51.200]   is because it shows that these are incredibly advanced chips.
[00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:56.200]   I mean, this is not yesterday's chip that Google's making.
[00:51:56.200 --> 00:51:58.320]   They're really trying to work at the cutting edge.
[00:51:58.320 --> 00:51:58.840]   Right.
[00:51:58.840 --> 00:52:00.920]   So what does this allow Google to do in terms
[00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:02.560]   of the functionality of the phone, anything?
[00:52:02.560 --> 00:52:03.080]   Or--
[00:52:03.080 --> 00:52:06.040]   Well, I can tell you from half my point of view,
[00:52:06.040 --> 00:52:08.120]   that one of the reasons they like making there on Silicon
[00:52:08.120 --> 00:52:11.280]   is because they don't have to build in things that they don't
[00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:13.400]   want, not merely the Qualcomm, right?
[00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:14.200]   Yes.
[00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:16.320]   But you don't have to--
[00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:18.040]   early on, they had an advantage because they didn't
[00:52:18.040 --> 00:52:19.880]   have to support Flash.
[00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:21.880]   And so--
[00:52:21.880 --> 00:52:23.440]   And you can optimize for--
[00:52:23.440 --> 00:52:26.360]   like, if you say you want to really optimize,
[00:52:26.360 --> 00:52:29.960]   like when Apple launched their--
[00:52:29.960 --> 00:52:31.440]   what was it--
[00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:36.040]   you can optimize for things like video taking if you want.
[00:52:36.040 --> 00:52:36.840]   And you can add--
[00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:37.280]   Exactly.
[00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:40.400]   You can oomph up your graphics processor
[00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:41.440]   for handling that.
[00:52:41.440 --> 00:52:43.960]   And so those are all like--
[00:52:43.960 --> 00:52:46.160]   It's the difference, Jeff, between--
[00:52:46.160 --> 00:52:47.840]   I'll put it in terms you'll understand--
[00:52:47.840 --> 00:52:52.320]   buying a cocktail at the 7-Eleven or mixing your own.
[00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:54.200]   Oh, I was going to say it's the difference between--
[00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:56.120]   Well, talk about Bell's difference.
[00:52:56.120 --> 00:52:58.160]   You're saying like basic WordPress
[00:52:58.160 --> 00:53:00.760]   or doing a custom CMS application.
[00:53:00.760 --> 00:53:02.200]   There you go.
[00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:04.760]   Although, custom CMSs are such a pain in the butt,
[00:53:04.760 --> 00:53:05.560]   it may be terrible.
[00:53:05.560 --> 00:53:07.240]   But designing a chip isn't easy.
[00:53:07.240 --> 00:53:07.740]   Right.
[00:53:07.740 --> 00:53:08.400]   Oh, no.
[00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:09.800]   Apple has more--
[00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:12.800]   According to rumors, Apple has more than 1,000 chip
[00:53:12.800 --> 00:53:15.440]   designers, people working in their chip.
[00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:16.720]   A lot of them are Austin.
[00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:17.480]   They bought-- yeah.
[00:53:17.480 --> 00:53:21.360]   They bought PA risk, which is the big chip design firm
[00:53:21.360 --> 00:53:22.760]   for risk chips.
[00:53:22.760 --> 00:53:23.880]   It's about a decade ago.
[00:53:23.880 --> 00:53:25.360]   I mean, Apple put--
[00:53:25.360 --> 00:53:29.040]   there's a massive investment into-- and of course, again,
[00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:32.600]   they don't make their chips TSMC and other companies make them.
[00:53:32.600 --> 00:53:35.760]   But in fact, even Samsung, I think, makes chips for Apple.
[00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:37.560]   But they design them.
[00:53:37.560 --> 00:53:40.200]   And by doing so, I think they have a lot better control
[00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:41.440]   over their platform.
[00:53:41.440 --> 00:53:45.120]   And everybody agrees that the iPad and the iPhone processors
[00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:48.000]   are light years ahead of what Qualcomm's offering.
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:48.560]   It's a much more--
[00:53:48.560 --> 00:53:49.640]   Yeah, you can opt on it.
[00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:52.800]   They also can do-- once you have that team in place,
[00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:55.560]   they can also work on other projects.
[00:53:55.560 --> 00:53:58.320]   So you see Apple doing their co-processor for movement,
[00:53:58.320 --> 00:54:01.400]   which gets you longer battery life and a small form factor
[00:54:01.400 --> 00:54:02.640]   on the Apple Watch.
[00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:07.160]   You can see them doing processors for computer vision,
[00:54:07.160 --> 00:54:09.560]   maybe in the future, or voice recognition.
[00:54:09.560 --> 00:54:13.280]   So once you have the skill set in place,
[00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:14.440]   you can really do a lot.
[00:54:14.440 --> 00:54:17.200]   And you lock out your competitors
[00:54:17.200 --> 00:54:20.720]   because they're stuck buying off the shelf parts.
[00:54:20.720 --> 00:54:22.840]   And they're not going to-- there's
[00:54:22.840 --> 00:54:25.800]   no way you could be as power efficient, for example,
[00:54:25.800 --> 00:54:28.000]   or pick some sort of optimization.
[00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:30.040]   They can't optimize as well.
[00:54:30.040 --> 00:54:35.520]   So this does make it really interesting, though, if you--
[00:54:35.520 --> 00:54:38.520]   I mean, one, holy cow, that's terrible for Qualcomm.
[00:54:38.520 --> 00:54:42.240]   But two, when you have all of these people who
[00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:46.120]   are huge companies building their own chips,
[00:54:46.120 --> 00:54:48.320]   if you're a chip maker, you suddenly
[00:54:48.320 --> 00:54:51.920]   have to serve a very different and much more varied part
[00:54:51.920 --> 00:54:52.480]   of the market.
[00:54:52.480 --> 00:54:54.520]   So how does that change your business?
[00:54:54.520 --> 00:54:56.040]   And that'll be an interesting--
[00:54:56.040 --> 00:54:58.280]   we've been talking about that for a while in the chip world,
[00:54:58.280 --> 00:55:01.280]   but it'll be interesting.
[00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:05.360]   If you're a fan of Google, this is very good news.
[00:55:05.360 --> 00:55:08.440]   It also, I should point out, is interesting
[00:55:08.440 --> 00:55:14.080]   because Google didn't create Android to make Google phones,
[00:55:14.080 --> 00:55:17.440]   didn't create Chrome OS to make Google Chromebooks.
[00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:21.080]   These was a way for Samsung to broaden its reach.
[00:55:21.080 --> 00:55:23.840]   I mean, Google to broaden its reach to get more people
[00:55:23.840 --> 00:55:25.200]   using Google services.
[00:55:25.200 --> 00:55:27.360]   That's where they saw their revenue.
[00:55:27.360 --> 00:55:30.520]   But if they start designing chips, it's in a way saying,
[00:55:30.520 --> 00:55:33.160]   yeah, we're a hardware company, too.
[00:55:33.160 --> 00:55:36.120]   And the Pixel phone and the Google Pixel books,
[00:55:36.120 --> 00:55:37.880]   these are an important product to us.
[00:55:37.880 --> 00:55:39.920]   And they will be-- unless Google gives away
[00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:42.680]   these designs, I doubt they will, but they will be--
[00:55:42.680 --> 00:55:44.840]   that'll be a differentiator.
[00:55:44.840 --> 00:55:48.560]   Right now, if I'm looking at the brand new OnePlus 8,
[00:55:48.560 --> 00:55:52.480]   comparing it to a Pixel 4, it's very--
[00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:55.680]   the hardware is similar, the software is similar.
[00:55:55.680 --> 00:55:57.280]   Google doesn't have a huge differentiator.
[00:55:57.280 --> 00:56:00.040]   If all of a sudden, like Apple, Google's Pixel
[00:56:00.040 --> 00:56:03.200]   has a different processor that nobody else can use,
[00:56:03.200 --> 00:56:04.800]   that's a very interesting--
[00:56:04.800 --> 00:56:05.600]   Is this kind of a--
[00:56:05.600 --> 00:56:06.120]   Sorry.
[00:56:06.120 --> 00:56:09.080]   I'm just switching roles today.
[00:56:09.080 --> 00:56:12.440]   Before I'm tech optimist, this is don't count on tech alone.
[00:56:12.440 --> 00:56:15.040]   So now I'm the Google fan who will try
[00:56:15.040 --> 00:56:17.360]   to look for the conspiracy theory.
[00:56:17.360 --> 00:56:19.560]   Is this rather like Amazon?
[00:56:19.560 --> 00:56:21.760]   Once you're trapped, now we can raise the rates on you
[00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:22.400]   and--
[00:56:22.400 --> 00:56:24.120]   I don't think Google play in such.
[00:56:24.120 --> 00:56:24.640]   No.
[00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:25.160]   OK.
[00:56:25.160 --> 00:56:27.480]   So it's not like Google's saying, OK, now that you only
[00:56:27.480 --> 00:56:29.520]   have two places to go, Android or Apple,
[00:56:29.520 --> 00:56:31.560]   and you can't go to Apple.
[00:56:31.560 --> 00:56:33.120]   We're getting into business guys.
[00:56:33.120 --> 00:56:35.680]   They're not going to screw the manufacturers
[00:56:35.680 --> 00:56:36.440]   in Android.
[00:56:36.440 --> 00:56:38.480]   They're going to screw Qualcomm.
[00:56:38.480 --> 00:56:40.600]   It's not the microsoft.
[00:56:40.600 --> 00:56:42.200]   Microsoft went through the same process.
[00:56:42.200 --> 00:56:44.400]   Remember, Microsoft sold Windows to PC makers,
[00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:46.960]   but never made PCs.
[00:56:46.960 --> 00:56:50.160]   And all of a sudden, Microsoft, a few years ago,
[00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:51.880]   said, we should make PCs.
[00:56:51.880 --> 00:56:54.080]   And there was some concern that they
[00:56:54.080 --> 00:56:58.200]   would irritate what they call the OEMs, the people who
[00:56:58.200 --> 00:57:03.560]   used Windows to make their own PCs, like Dell and Lenovo and HP.
[00:57:03.560 --> 00:57:07.280]   But so Microsoft, just as Google did with its pixel books,
[00:57:07.280 --> 00:57:12.160]   picked a certain lane of hardware and stuck to it,
[00:57:12.160 --> 00:57:14.080]   saying things like, well, we're doing--
[00:57:14.080 --> 00:57:17.320]   as Google did, it's a reference design.
[00:57:17.320 --> 00:57:20.920]   We're doing something to lead the way for other PC
[00:57:20.920 --> 00:57:21.880]   manufacturers.
[00:57:21.880 --> 00:57:25.800]   There's plenty of room in the space for differentiation.
[00:57:25.800 --> 00:57:28.360]   It's not quite the same in the Android world, I think.
[00:57:28.360 --> 00:57:31.680]   If you have a Google phone that has a different processor,
[00:57:31.680 --> 00:57:33.080]   there's going to be a lot of temptation
[00:57:33.080 --> 00:57:36.360]   to optimize Android for that processor, for instance.
[00:57:36.360 --> 00:57:38.920]   If I were manufacturing Android phones,
[00:57:38.920 --> 00:57:39.960]   I'd be a little nervous.
[00:57:39.960 --> 00:57:41.760]   But I think Google made the calculation,
[00:57:41.760 --> 00:57:43.440]   well, where are they going to go?
[00:57:43.440 --> 00:57:43.920]   What else?
[00:57:43.920 --> 00:57:46.800]   Well, if they're working with Samsung and Exynos chips,
[00:57:46.800 --> 00:57:48.360]   then they've really--
[00:57:48.360 --> 00:57:51.760]   I mean, isn't Samsung the second largest producer of Android
[00:57:51.760 --> 00:57:53.960]   or the first largest producer of Android phones?
[00:57:53.960 --> 00:57:54.920]   Yeah.
[00:57:54.920 --> 00:57:56.520]   OK.
[00:57:56.520 --> 00:57:58.280]   I wonder if Google looks at that and says,
[00:57:58.280 --> 00:58:00.480]   we'd like to be the largest producer of Android phones.
[00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:01.960]   They also have to be a little dissatisfied
[00:58:01.960 --> 00:58:03.920]   with the low end of the Android market, which
[00:58:03.920 --> 00:58:05.840]   is causing them no end of headaches.
[00:58:05.840 --> 00:58:08.280]   Because whenever you hear about security issues,
[00:58:08.280 --> 00:58:10.600]   out-of-date operating systems, that's
[00:58:10.600 --> 00:58:12.280]   where all of that's happening.
[00:58:12.280 --> 00:58:13.880]   And I'm sure that that bothers Google
[00:58:13.880 --> 00:58:15.120]   that there is such a down market.
[00:58:15.120 --> 00:58:16.560]   On the other hand, that's why Android
[00:58:16.560 --> 00:58:19.080]   is the number one operating system in the world,
[00:58:19.080 --> 00:58:20.960]   by sheer number.
[00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:22.320]   Well, that was the whole strategy.
[00:58:22.320 --> 00:58:26.000]   I remember at Davos, when Eric Schmidt talked about it,
[00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:27.560]   he said, we're going to give it away for free,
[00:58:27.560 --> 00:58:29.360]   and that's going to make it grow, and that's our strategy,
[00:58:29.360 --> 00:58:29.760]   and that's that.
[00:58:29.760 --> 00:58:31.880]   Because we make money when you use the internet.
[00:58:31.880 --> 00:58:35.120]   And it's good for us, right?
[00:58:35.120 --> 00:58:38.120]   That's why I wonder why they're making chips now.
[00:58:38.120 --> 00:58:41.760]   It sounds like a sea change in Google's overall strategy
[00:58:41.760 --> 00:58:44.760]   that they want to have a differentiator.
[00:58:44.760 --> 00:58:48.520]   Is Samsung going to have these Google phone Google chips?
[00:58:48.520 --> 00:58:48.960]   I don't know.
[00:58:48.960 --> 00:58:50.160]   This is all we're interested.
[00:58:50.160 --> 00:58:52.520]   Oh, Samsung does make their own exenos.
[00:58:52.520 --> 00:58:55.080]   But exenos processors are functionally equivalent.
[00:58:55.080 --> 00:58:57.480]   In fact, if you buy a Samsung phone in the US,
[00:58:57.480 --> 00:58:59.440]   you get a Qualcomm processor because they
[00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:00.800]   need the radios.
[00:59:00.800 --> 00:59:02.200]   But if you buy it in the rest of the world,
[00:59:02.200 --> 00:59:03.640]   they use an exenos processor.
[00:59:03.640 --> 00:59:05.720]   But those phones aren't that different.
[00:59:05.720 --> 00:59:08.560]   They're using virtually the same software, right?
[00:59:08.560 --> 00:59:09.320]   Same features.
[00:59:09.320 --> 00:59:10.640]   And it could be for--
[00:59:10.640 --> 00:59:13.080]   I mean, it could be a server-based chip.
[00:59:13.080 --> 00:59:13.480]   I don't know.
[00:59:13.480 --> 00:59:14.240]   I mean, we just don't know what it is.
[00:59:14.240 --> 00:59:15.800]   Oh, we don't know that it's for Android?
[00:59:15.800 --> 00:59:18.560]   Oh, I thought we knew it was for Android and Chrome OS.
[00:59:18.560 --> 00:59:21.320]   I think people are basing that because it's an arm.
[00:59:21.320 --> 00:59:23.120]   OK.
[00:59:23.120 --> 00:59:24.960]   Well, that I may be completely wrong.
[00:59:24.960 --> 00:59:27.720]   Because maybe Google will not do that.
[00:59:27.720 --> 00:59:31.400]   They want arm chips for servers, too, because they're low power.
[00:59:31.400 --> 00:59:33.360]   The biggest cost is energy.
[00:59:33.360 --> 00:59:34.120]   Yeah, I'm just--
[00:59:34.120 --> 00:59:38.200]   I'm trying to see if the rumor ties it to the phones
[00:59:38.200 --> 00:59:41.480]   or if it's just the chip.
[00:59:41.480 --> 00:59:43.920]   It's an interesting--
[00:59:43.920 --> 00:59:45.920]   it's a business conundrum.
[00:59:45.920 --> 00:59:51.680]   Oh, Google reportedly expects that Whitechapel
[00:59:51.680 --> 00:59:54.080]   will start shipping with Pixel phones in the next year
[00:59:54.080 --> 00:59:54.760]   at the earliest.
[00:59:54.760 --> 00:59:55.960]   There you go.
[00:59:55.960 --> 00:59:56.800]   So yes.
[00:59:56.800 --> 00:59:57.960]   That's really interesting.
[00:59:57.960 --> 01:00:00.600]   Because pixels have not sold well.
[01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:05.520]   And if Google holds true, it's Davos statement, Jeff.
[01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:08.440]   And then it doesn't matter if Pixel phones sell.
[01:00:08.440 --> 01:00:09.040]   Right.
[01:00:09.040 --> 01:00:10.240]   No.
[01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:13.400]   But if Google wants to have a hardware market,
[01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:16.400]   hardware business, why would Google--
[01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:18.120]   Oh, this is interesting.
[01:00:18.120 --> 01:00:19.680]   So they're putting a module dedicated
[01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:22.880]   to improving the power efficiency and performance
[01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:24.160]   of Google Assistant.
[01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:26.520]   So take that.
[01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:27.600]   Their design.
[01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:29.840]   Now imagine them having a reference design
[01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:32.400]   onto other battery-powered devices
[01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:35.080]   to bring Google Assistant to more places.
[01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:38.520]   Apple always said with all that AI locally.
[01:00:38.520 --> 01:00:39.000]   Right.
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:41.000]   That's what-- OK, that's what--
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:41.720]   What are possible?
[01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:45.440]   Really show off what their AI can do distributed.
[01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:47.360]   Apple always said, if you want to make a good product,
[01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:49.720]   you have to control the hardware and the software stack.
[01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:50.080]   That was--
[01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:52.000]   Well, Apple would say that because that's what they did.
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.960]   Well, but that was Steve Jobs' plan all along.
[01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:55.200]   Was we want to control--
[01:00:55.200 --> 01:00:58.560]   that's why they made computers and why they made Mac OS,
[01:00:58.560 --> 01:01:01.360]   because-- or before that, whatever they call it--
[01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:03.360]   System 7.
[01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:06.240]   Because they needed-- Jobs was always of the strong belief
[01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:07.840]   you had to do both.
[01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:11.480]   In the early days of the Apple II,
[01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:13.920]   yeah, I guess it was the case even back then.
[01:01:13.920 --> 01:01:14.560]   They made both.
[01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:20.440]   He always felt that you had to tightly integrate hardware
[01:01:20.440 --> 01:01:21.400]   and software.
[01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:21.800]   And they--
[01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:23.920]   Hey, you want to talk about the new iPhone and chips?
[01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:29.400]   Sure, the iPhone SE snuck out of the barn this morning.
[01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:31.960]   Got me up at 8 a.m.
[01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:33.920]   ordering stuff from the Apple Store.
[01:01:33.920 --> 01:01:37.160]   They also announced and will be shipping next week
[01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:39.640]   their new magic keyboard for the iPad,
[01:01:39.640 --> 01:01:42.680]   which frankly is, to me, the most interesting thing
[01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:44.080]   they've announced in a while, because it really
[01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:45.120]   makes the iPad--
[01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:48.280]   starts to make the iPad a computer.
[01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:49.880]   It's got a trackpad.
[01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:51.320]   It's got a real keyboard.
[01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:53.280]   Same keyboard is on their laptops.
[01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:55.120]   And it's expensive.
[01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:56.720]   300 bucks.
[01:01:56.720 --> 01:01:57.280]   $300.
[01:01:57.280 --> 01:02:02.520]   Which is $100 less than the cost of the SE,
[01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:04.680]   which I am just like-- I am in love with this phone.
[01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:05.600]   I am excited about it.
[01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:06.520]   It's running the same--
[01:02:06.520 --> 01:02:07.000]   It's 4.7 inches.
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:08.360]   It is the same processor.
[01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:09.560]   So it's a small phone.
[01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:12.360]   It's a current processor, right?
[01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:16.280]   It is the processor that iPad Pro 11.
[01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:17.040]   Right.
[01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:18.120]   Or-- sorry, not the iPad Pro.
[01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:18.640]   Sorry.
[01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:20.240]   No, that is the iPad Pro.
[01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:24.680]   No, the iPad Pro has a later processor, I think.
[01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:29.600]   It's the 8.12, right, in this one.
[01:02:29.600 --> 01:02:32.840]   We were just so excited about this this morning.
[01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:33.440]   Oh, my god.
[01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:35.600]   I hate Apple's design crazy.
[01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:37.360]   Just show me the frickin' specs.
[01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:38.440]   Go by finding it.
[01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:40.000]   Yeah, we're so-- we were a little disappointed,
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:41.880]   because of course we do our Apple shows on Tuesday
[01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:43.320]   and Apple announced-- and normally Apple
[01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:45.040]   announces new products on Tuesday.
[01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:48.440]   But this time they announced it on Wednesday, which
[01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:49.720]   is actually with the room around the south.
[01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:50.800]   It's beautiful.
[01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:53.440]   Comes black, white, and product red.
[01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:56.280]   It looks a lot like an iPhone 8,
[01:02:56.280 --> 01:03:00.240]   except it has an aluminum edge now, which I think is quite nice.
[01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:03.240]   It'll start at $400.
[01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:04.720]   It does have a current processor,
[01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:08.000]   which is what the SE did last time too, which is good,
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:13.280]   because you want a phone that has a current processor
[01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:15.280]   so you can run the current operating system,
[01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:16.880]   even if it is only 4.7 inches.
[01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:18.800]   It's the A13 Bionic chip.
[01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:19.640]   Oh, it is.
[01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:22.320]   That's the same chip as in the iPad.
[01:03:22.320 --> 01:03:23.200]   OK, that's what I thought.
[01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:25.720]   OK, yeah, no, it's frickin' awesome.
[01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:26.800]   That's why I was so proud.
[01:03:26.800 --> 01:03:29.320]   That means it'll have a great camera, only one lens,
[01:03:29.320 --> 01:03:32.240]   but still it'll have a great camera.
[01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:36.800]   Portrait mode using monocular depth sensing, which is magic.
[01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:38.560]   Monocular.
[01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:39.360]   You only have one eye.
[01:03:39.360 --> 01:03:41.680]   My wife is so pissed about this.
[01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:42.920]   Why?
[01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:44.400]   She just spent a lot of money.
[01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:45.480]   She's not a small one.
[01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:51.320]   No, she still carried around the 1988 iPhone.
[01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:52.840]   Whatever the small one was.
[01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:55.640]   1988.
[01:03:55.640 --> 01:03:56.360]   And she was not--
[01:03:56.360 --> 01:03:58.840]   What, this was small?
[01:03:58.840 --> 01:04:01.520]   A 4.7, so is it the iPhone 6?
[01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:02.960]   How big was it 5?
[01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:05.840]   Do we know?
[01:04:05.840 --> 01:04:07.280]   I feel like that.
[01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:09.680]   I was surprised to see 4.7, because I thought the--
[01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:10.760]   what's the small--
[01:04:10.760 --> 01:04:11.600]   4 inch.
[01:04:11.600 --> 01:04:12.600]   Small as 4.8.
[01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:13.600]   That's what's the small--
[01:04:13.600 --> 01:04:14.600]   So this is a little more 4.7?
[01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:15.600]   Yeah, it's not so much bigger.
[01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:16.400]   4.7.
[01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:19.360]   Still a smallest iPhone by far.
[01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:21.320]   Yeah.
[01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:26.320]   The new iPad Pro has an A12Z bionic.
[01:04:26.320 --> 01:04:29.120]   The A13 is in the iPhone 11.
[01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:31.160]   iPhone 11 and the iPhone 11 and the Pro.
[01:04:31.160 --> 01:04:32.120]   Right.
[01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:34.120]   Thank you, Chatham.
[01:04:34.120 --> 01:04:36.960]   And by the way, the product Redphone, as you know,
[01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:43.440]   product Red is the Bono sponsored AIDS relief project.
[01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:46.880]   But in this case, it will be donated to COVID-19.
[01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:47.640]   Very good.
[01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:51.640]   So speaking to my wife, by the way, she just sent me
[01:04:51.640 --> 01:04:54.560]   her new favorite follow on Twitter.
[01:04:54.560 --> 01:04:55.760]   Rate my Skype room.
[01:04:55.760 --> 01:04:58.200]   Have you seen this one?
[01:04:58.200 --> 01:04:59.480]   It's brilliant.
[01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:04.440]   Is this for people to the backdrop?
[01:05:04.440 --> 01:05:06.440]   The people who are now on TV.
[01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:09.400]   So it's Twitter/ratebyz.
[01:05:09.400 --> 01:05:10.480]   Oh, this is so funny.
[01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:12.320]   Skype room.
[01:05:12.320 --> 01:05:13.760]   Oh, so they're looking at the art.
[01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:16.280]   I know I do this when I look at people.
[01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:17.400]   They're looking at-- in fact, we've
[01:05:17.400 --> 01:05:25.160]   even talked about messy bookshelves and other things.
[01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:26.080]   Fun chic.
[01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:26.880]   We want the lamp.
[01:05:26.880 --> 01:05:28.240]   Style plus.
[01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:32.440]   That's Kimberly Eakins on CNN.
[01:05:32.440 --> 01:05:34.600]   Oh, no, that's NBC.
[01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:35.960]   This is fun.
[01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:35.960]   Yeah.
[01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:36.720]   This is a lot of fun.
[01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:37.560]   Yeah.
[01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:39.880]   Bit of a mess, but I think two points for color coordinating
[01:05:39.880 --> 01:05:41.280]   bow tie and globe.
[01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:43.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:05:43.640 --> 01:05:45.160]   Dr. Hotels.
[01:05:45.160 --> 01:05:49.240]   You don't want to read the one for Lindsey Graham, but it's funny.
[01:05:49.240 --> 01:05:51.920]   Good neutral color, attractive put case.
[01:05:51.920 --> 01:05:53.440]   Our guess is he's Italian.
[01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:56.000]   That's Mike Bomoli and NBC News.
[01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:58.520]   Sean Penn, actor and founder.
[01:05:58.520 --> 01:06:00.040]   A tent.
[01:06:00.040 --> 01:06:01.400]   Tent gets high marks.
[01:06:01.400 --> 01:06:02.240]   He's in a tent.
[01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:02.880]   He's in a yard.
[01:06:02.880 --> 01:06:03.840]   Yeah, he was in a tent today.
[01:06:03.840 --> 01:06:04.840]   Yeah.
[01:06:04.840 --> 01:06:05.520]   OK.
[01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:06.680]   Next one's good too.
[01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:08.960]   Here's Bernie, two nice paintings.
[01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:11.280]   This may be Bernie's Airbnb, not sure.
[01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:14.240]   There's a picture of a Vermont barn.
[01:06:14.240 --> 01:06:15.440]   I don't like it.
[01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:17.160]   Just I like a little depth.
[01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:18.200]   It's always good.
[01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:20.840]   That's why I love your set, Jeff, because it's
[01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:22.520]   got your whole room behind you.
[01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:24.160]   I don't like corners behind people.
[01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:24.640]   I don't like people.
[01:06:24.640 --> 01:06:25.280]   I don't like people.
[01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:25.840]   I don't like it.
[01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:27.200]   I don't want that problem with me.
[01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:27.760]   Yeah.
[01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:30.160]   But it makes sense if you have a lot of stuff,
[01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:32.000]   because your corner is going to be the only place
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:33.800]   that you don't have stuff.
[01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:35.520]   The corner is clean.
[01:06:35.520 --> 01:06:38.560]   Yeah, I'm looking forward to reading more of these.
[01:06:38.560 --> 01:06:40.480]   Well, he's Richard Engel.
[01:06:40.480 --> 01:06:41.640]   Well lit.
[01:06:41.640 --> 01:06:43.720]   Good color mix.
[01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:47.440]   And apparently they noticed he has a Steve Reeves movie
[01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:50.560]   poster behind a goliath.
[01:06:50.560 --> 01:06:53.600]   Who doesn't like an old Steve Reeves movie?
[01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:58.040]   Wow, Richard Engel showing some verve there.
[01:06:58.040 --> 01:07:03.240]   OK, Professor Ugly Chair, blank walls and diplomas, please.
[01:07:03.240 --> 01:07:04.120]   Three out of 10.
[01:07:04.120 --> 01:07:05.680]   Three out of 10.
[01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:07.040]   This is pretty funny.
[01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:09.040]   I have to say, I'm enjoying it.
[01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:09.960]   Claire McCaskill.
[01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:11.920]   The one at Claire McCaskill entered kitchen.
[01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:12.600]   In her kitchen.
[01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:15.480]   What is the hell on a B?
[01:07:15.480 --> 01:07:18.320]   You know, Becky Worley has been doing Skype calls
[01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:19.440]   for Good Morning America.
[01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:21.880]   My good friend Becky Worley for many years.
[01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:23.040]   She was, I think, the first.
[01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:24.080]   It was great.
[01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:25.240]   And she's in her kitchen.
[01:07:25.240 --> 01:07:26.160]   Always looks great.
[01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:26.800]   I love it.
[01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:28.080]   Yeah, but it's Becky.
[01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:30.400]   That's OK.
[01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:34.560]   I think they like Tony Fauci's beautiful.
[01:07:34.560 --> 01:07:36.680]   See, this is Tony's taking a chance.
[01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:37.180]   He's got.
[01:07:37.180 --> 01:07:37.680]   Oh, yeah.
[01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:38.200]   That is a chance.
[01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:38.800]   He's got back glitting, right?
[01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:40.120]   He's got a big, big, big window.
[01:07:40.120 --> 01:07:43.040]   But obviously somebody came over from NBC,
[01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:46.320]   or maybe from the CDC, or somewhere, maybe Jared Kushner.
[01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:50.000]   And they put lights in front of him, so he's got fill lights,
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:50.920]   so it's balancing him.
[01:07:50.920 --> 01:07:53.760]   So he's breaking the rules, but only because he has a better
[01:07:53.760 --> 01:07:55.840]   setup than you do.
[01:07:55.840 --> 01:07:58.880]   A lot of people-- they aren't ring lights also sold out.
[01:07:58.880 --> 01:08:00.080]   Yeah, probably they are.
[01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:04.440]   I think maybe, buddy.
[01:08:04.440 --> 01:08:06.720]   Oh, my goodness.
[01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:10.000]   President Obama, one of the best skiperums ever.
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:15.040]   I mean, you couldn't get better than this.
[01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:16.280]   The depth of field.
[01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:16.800]   You can't.
[01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:21.600]   The lighting, the set, the dimly viewed basketball,
[01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:23.720]   and the bookshelf, all excellent.
[01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:26.320]   And the depth of field is real, as opposed to the fake--
[01:08:26.320 --> 01:08:27.800]   Oh, don't use the fake Skype deck.
[01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:28.920]   Background, pretty filter.
[01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:29.960]   I just hate you.
[01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:30.440]   Yeah, don't use it.
[01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:31.560]   This is funny, too.
[01:08:31.560 --> 01:08:34.280]   Nice space, but we frown on product placement in skiperums.
[01:08:34.280 --> 01:08:36.800]   She's got a big apple eye mac over her left shoulder.
[01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:37.560]   That's hysterical.
[01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:39.640]   Or does she have her books on the shelf?
[01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:41.480]   Oh, her own books, too, huh?
[01:08:41.480 --> 01:08:42.000]   Maybe.
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:42.560]   I want Ashley Parker.
[01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:45.400]   I always make sure I've got my own books on the shelf by me.
[01:08:45.400 --> 01:08:47.440]   What are you?
[01:08:47.440 --> 01:08:51.320]   Nice kitchen, orange is help, but it's a little stark.
[01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:52.640]   John Heilman.
[01:08:52.640 --> 01:08:54.560]   I think it's quite nice, actually.
[01:08:54.560 --> 01:08:55.200]   Yeah, it is nice.
[01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:57.080]   Yeah, it is nice.
[01:08:57.080 --> 01:08:58.520]   It's interesting, isn't it?
[01:08:58.520 --> 01:09:00.600]   Lisa, of course, has been doing a lot of Zoom meetings
[01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:01.040]   from home.
[01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:02.880]   And for a while, she was positioned
[01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:06.680]   so that the cat tower was just over her shoulder.
[01:09:06.680 --> 01:09:10.960]   We've repositioned her now, so she's got a fireplace.
[01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:14.200]   Some more attractive stuff behind her.
[01:09:14.200 --> 01:09:16.800]   You do have to think about that, don't you?
[01:09:16.800 --> 01:09:20.400]   Yeah, I can't wait to move and have my own office
[01:09:20.400 --> 01:09:22.080]   so I can have a nicer setup.
[01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:26.600]   Are you going to-- see, I've decided
[01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:28.280]   I'm going to put a green screen behind me
[01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:32.520]   and project this set so you won't know if I'm home.
[01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:33.840]   I have a green screen.
[01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:35.400]   I just don't like using it.
[01:09:35.400 --> 01:09:37.680]   I don't want to see you at home, Leo.
[01:09:37.680 --> 01:09:40.520]   Well, if I don't see the real Leo.
[01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:43.400]   I've done the AMAs from home.
[01:09:43.400 --> 01:09:45.560]   But in fact, we're going to do game night on Friday.
[01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:47.280]   You're all invited if you want.
[01:09:47.280 --> 01:09:47.800]   We're going to--
[01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:48.640]   I don't know, Kate.
[01:09:48.640 --> 01:09:51.320]   We're going to play--
[01:09:51.320 --> 01:09:52.360]   you don't know, Jack.
[01:09:52.360 --> 01:09:54.560]   We're going to play trivia, I think.
[01:09:54.560 --> 01:09:55.280]   It's going to be a lot of fun.
[01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:57.760]   Stacy, have you found a home speaking of homes?
[01:10:00.280 --> 01:10:01.720]   I'm sorry, I'm asking us.
[01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:02.680]   Nor did I ask.
[01:10:02.680 --> 01:10:03.160]   OK, I'm sorry.
[01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:04.080]   It hurts me.
[01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:04.560]   Oh, no.
[01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:05.480]   That was painful.
[01:10:05.480 --> 01:10:07.680]   We know that Stacy has to move out at the end of the month
[01:10:07.680 --> 01:10:09.200]   so the clock is ticking.
[01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:10.200]   The end of June.
[01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:11.520]   Oh, have you got one more time?
[01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:12.080]   Six weeks.
[01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:13.440]   But that's still--
[01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:15.960]   It's still soon to buy and close at a house.
[01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:16.480]   Still.
[01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:17.400]   Especially if we don't have one.
[01:10:17.400 --> 01:10:18.880]   I'm sorry, Stacy.
[01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:21.960]   Have you been able to virtually look?
[01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:23.360]   There's just nothing on the market.
[01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:26.080]   She said there's two houses available, two.
[01:10:26.080 --> 01:10:29.760]   There's-- OK, there's like 12 houses in our price range
[01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:30.760]   on Bainbridge.
[01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:31.440]   Well, that's not too bad.
[01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:32.440]   All right.
[01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:34.760]   Well, 12 is not a lot of houses.
[01:10:34.760 --> 01:10:38.160]   And some of them are not great at houses.
[01:10:38.160 --> 01:10:41.880]   I mean, a lot of them are really tiny for people
[01:10:41.880 --> 01:10:45.480]   who have two people working from home and a teenager.
[01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:47.400]   Oh, that.
[01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:47.960]   Yeah.
[01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:49.960]   Anyway.
[01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:54.160]   There's a lot-- I noticed, as I have joined my family
[01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:56.920]   walking about this cute little town of Ars Petaluma,
[01:10:56.920 --> 01:10:58.920]   A, what a great town it is.
[01:10:58.920 --> 01:10:59.360]   It is.
[01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:03.120]   But B, there are a lot of houses for sale.
[01:11:03.120 --> 01:11:03.600]   Really?
[01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:05.040]   This seems like it would be a bad time
[01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:06.360]   to try to sell a house.
[01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:07.560]   Oh, god, yeah.
[01:11:07.560 --> 01:11:08.040]   Yeah.
[01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:11.320]   I mean, if you don't have to sell it, you should totally wait.
[01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:14.280]   But if you do have a great house on Bainbridge
[01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:17.880]   and you want to sell it, let me know.
[01:11:17.880 --> 01:11:19.680]   That's a good idea.
[01:11:19.680 --> 01:11:22.280]   You use the force, AKA--
[01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:23.960]   My husband's been on Facebook.
[01:11:23.960 --> 01:11:26.880]   I mean, he's definitely reached out to lots of people.
[01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:29.880]   So anyway.
[01:11:29.880 --> 01:11:30.400]   It's OK.
[01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:31.960]   Apple--
[01:11:31.960 --> 01:11:33.440]   We did the iPhone.
[01:11:33.440 --> 01:11:34.560]   We did the keyboard.
[01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:37.600]   I think that was the two products announced.
[01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:40.800]   Well, we had-- hello, the Pixel 4A.
[01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:42.200]   Oh, do they announce that today?
[01:11:42.200 --> 01:11:42.960]   No, they didn't announce it.
[01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:43.800]   They haven't announced it yet.
[01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:44.800]   But they've all butted it.
[01:11:44.800 --> 01:11:47.000]   She got my hosts up.
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.520]   Any minute now.
[01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:50.040]   Any minute now.
[01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:51.480]   We would have gotten it at I/O.
[01:11:51.480 --> 01:11:55.640]   You know, Dan Willy, we would have had it at 4A at I/O.
[01:11:55.640 --> 01:11:58.160]   Oh, well, let's take a break.
[01:11:58.160 --> 01:12:03.560]   Then we come back the Google Change Log for everybody.
[01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:06.160]   For one and all.
[01:12:06.160 --> 01:12:07.680]   You gave Jeff Farch a much warning.
[01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:09.000]   That's not as much fun.
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:12.240]   Jeff already told me he is prepared.
[01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:17.680]   Before the show, he said, I'm ready for the change log, will you?
[01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:19.280]   So I--
[01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:21.160]   You know.
[01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:23.120]   Carston's sending me his two cents.
[01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:24.000]   Thank you, Carston.
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:25.840]   Carston always sends his two cents.
[01:12:25.840 --> 01:12:28.120]   That's one thing you can count on with Carston.
[01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:29.600]   Hey, let me just put it in a plug here.
[01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:33.320]   I would like to have Carston Camp in some form.
[01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:36.440]   Now, on the Howard Stern Show, they have--
[01:12:36.440 --> 01:12:38.360]   It's Boba Bowie at home.
[01:12:38.360 --> 01:12:40.040]   They had Boba Bowie puppet.
[01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:41.080]   That'd be Gary puppet.
[01:12:41.080 --> 01:12:43.600]   All right, I'm going to give you a Carston puppet.
[01:12:43.600 --> 01:12:44.760]   Carston puppet with the words.
[01:12:44.760 --> 01:12:47.280]   We could have a Google display right here.
[01:12:47.280 --> 01:12:48.720]   And we could put Carston--
[01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:51.800]   we could do a duo call with Carston.
[01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:54.600]   And then he could be right here giving his insight.
[01:12:54.600 --> 01:12:56.360]   That was the else resisted, yeah.
[01:12:56.360 --> 01:12:58.280]   I think Carston puppet with the book on.
[01:12:58.280 --> 01:13:00.200]   Oh, no, we put it right here, because then he
[01:13:00.200 --> 01:13:01.200]   could talk to the microphone.
[01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:03.280]   That makes way more sense.
[01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:04.640]   Why did Carston offer you?
[01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:06.600]   He did not come after me.
[01:13:06.600 --> 01:13:08.240]   He did not come after me.
[01:13:08.240 --> 01:13:09.400]   He offered me nothing.
[01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:10.960]   I just love Carston Camp.
[01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:13.360]   Like, after last week's show, he sent us all his, like,
[01:13:13.360 --> 01:13:14.720]   Carston's two cents on the show.
[01:13:14.720 --> 01:13:15.720]   It's like--
[01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:16.720]   The things that would have said--
[01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:17.560]   It's Carston.
[01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:19.640]   --to me.
[01:13:19.640 --> 01:13:21.600]   Well, maybe he knows that you don't
[01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:22.800]   want him on the show.
[01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:24.000]   He knows I yell at him.
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:30.080]   All right, well, we could dial him up.
[01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:34.240]   I think what I'm envisioning a little tiny 9-inch TV
[01:13:34.240 --> 01:13:35.240]   screen there on the desk.
[01:13:35.240 --> 01:13:36.080]   Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:39.160]   We could put a little virtual Carston floating around.
[01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:40.960]   He could be like a little screen saver,
[01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:43.560]   bobbing around the screen, if you want.
[01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:47.240]   But we did his voice case is rye, nasty, spammy--
[01:13:47.240 --> 01:13:48.360]   Skype, man.
[01:13:48.360 --> 01:13:50.200]   --trollish voice coming in once in a while.
[01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:51.120]   I say that with all right.
[01:13:51.120 --> 01:13:52.120]   Well, wait a minute.
[01:13:52.120 --> 01:13:53.120]   Spammy?
[01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:55.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:13:55.200 --> 01:13:55.840]   I don't know.
[01:13:55.840 --> 01:13:56.720]   I was making it up.
[01:13:56.720 --> 01:13:58.760]   I am going to make this possible.
[01:13:58.760 --> 01:13:59.560]   Hold on a second.
[01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:06.360]   I'm going to set up a special place for Carston.
[01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:11.560]   Carston, I think you know what I'm talking about.
[01:14:11.560 --> 01:14:12.120]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:14:12.120 --> 01:14:12.920]   My server's down.
[01:14:12.920 --> 01:14:14.480]   Never mind.
[01:14:14.480 --> 01:14:16.040]   Oh, shoot.
[01:14:16.040 --> 01:14:17.560]   Somebody must have knocked the plug out.
[01:14:17.560 --> 01:14:20.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:22.520]   I set up a Jitzy server at home.
[01:14:22.520 --> 01:14:24.080]   It's awesome.
[01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:27.600]   And you just go in, and I could easily set it up.
[01:14:27.600 --> 01:14:30.960]   But unfortunately, it seems to be offline.
[01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:33.120]   Yeah, I heard also like one frame a second.
[01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:34.160]   No, it's pretty good.
[01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:35.640]   I like it.
[01:14:35.640 --> 01:14:40.640]   That's just dependent on how much bandwidth you server.
[01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:42.720]   But see, it's running on my own server,
[01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:44.080]   so it works pretty well.
[01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:45.640]   I've been using it with a family mostly.
[01:14:49.240 --> 01:14:50.680]   You were going to do a commercial.
[01:14:50.680 --> 01:14:51.120]   I was.
[01:14:51.120 --> 01:14:52.600]   Yeah.
[01:14:52.600 --> 01:14:56.720]   And Jeff, if you want to pull up Carston, you can.
[01:14:56.720 --> 01:15:03.760]   Our show today, you can tell my enthusiasm is overwhelming.
[01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:08.320]   We can just get a Carston bobble head.
[01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:08.800]   Wait, wait, wait.
[01:15:08.800 --> 01:15:09.800]   We'll run it.
[01:15:09.800 --> 01:15:10.920]   I'm going to go over the chat.
[01:15:10.920 --> 01:15:11.920]   You're going to see this.
[01:15:11.920 --> 01:15:12.600]   So this is the Gary puppet.
[01:15:12.600 --> 01:15:13.760]   This is going to make you happy.
[01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:15.240]   OK.
[01:15:15.240 --> 01:15:16.840]   So there.
[01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:18.720]   Gary puppet.
[01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:22.360]   Gary is another one of Stern's producers.
[01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:23.360]   Gary Dilibate.
[01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:25.560]   He's the actual producer of the show.
[01:15:25.560 --> 01:15:27.560]   Yes, he's the producer.
[01:15:27.560 --> 01:15:29.200]   That's a good puppet.
[01:15:29.200 --> 01:15:29.840]   It's a good puppet.
[01:15:29.840 --> 01:15:32.600]   That really looks like him.
[01:15:32.600 --> 01:15:34.600]   We have puppets.
[01:15:34.600 --> 01:15:36.200]   I have a Leo puppet.
[01:15:36.200 --> 01:15:39.040]   So I have a Carston puppet with a bow tie.
[01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:40.120]   You've got to have the bow tie.
[01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:48.200]   Oh, we pissed off the boss.
[01:15:48.200 --> 01:15:50.160]   This was not Carston's fault, really.
[01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:50.520]   Oh, yeah.
[01:15:50.520 --> 01:15:52.240]   Carston did not put us up to any of the boss.
[01:15:52.240 --> 01:15:53.000]   He did not put us up.
[01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:54.640]   Oh, please.
[01:15:54.640 --> 01:15:55.120]   He did not.
[01:15:55.120 --> 01:15:55.640]   I swear.
[01:15:55.640 --> 01:15:56.880]   You think I don't know.
[01:15:56.880 --> 01:15:59.960]   I would throw Carston under the bus in a second.
[01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:00.360]   All right.
[01:16:00.360 --> 01:16:01.040]   I would not.
[01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:02.200]   But because he throws well.
[01:16:02.200 --> 01:16:02.880]   He would never try to get it.
[01:16:02.880 --> 01:16:05.080]   He throws me under the bus all the time.
[01:16:05.080 --> 01:16:08.600]   So I would, in retribution, throw him under the bus.
[01:16:08.600 --> 01:16:08.880]   Uh-oh.
[01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:10.720]   Where are we going?
[01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:12.800]   We've pissed him off so much.
[01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:14.240]   We've pissed him off so much.
[01:16:14.240 --> 01:16:15.160]   He's left the show.
[01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:17.400]   Carston, you've done it now.
[01:16:17.400 --> 01:16:18.480]   You've done it now.
[01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:20.240]   You've pissed off Leo.
[01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:22.920]   He's coming to get you.
[01:16:22.920 --> 01:16:25.320]   Where did Leo go?
[01:16:25.320 --> 01:16:25.920]   Ooh.
[01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:27.920]   Do I have to sing and dance now?
[01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:30.360]   Did you notice, by the way, that I have my own lower third?
[01:16:30.360 --> 01:16:32.240]   I'm wearing my lower third.
[01:16:32.240 --> 01:16:33.240]   Oh, nice.
[01:16:33.240 --> 01:16:34.240]   New Mark.
[01:16:34.240 --> 01:16:34.920]   Yeah.
[01:16:34.920 --> 01:16:36.320]   New Mark J School?
[01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:37.480]   Oh.
[01:16:37.480 --> 01:16:38.440]   Oh.
[01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:40.920]   UT should get something for their J School that
[01:16:40.920 --> 01:16:42.280]   looks just as cool.
[01:16:42.280 --> 01:16:43.560]   The Cronkite J School.
[01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:46.080]   But they're not as cool as we are, so they can't.
[01:16:46.080 --> 01:16:46.880]   We are the coolest.
[01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:48.920]   You're so cooler.
[01:16:48.920 --> 01:16:49.760]   So much cooler.
[01:16:49.760 --> 01:16:50.840]   I have many friends there.
[01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:51.840]   I have many friends there.
[01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:53.480]   Let me plug in my headphones.
[01:16:53.480 --> 01:16:53.680]   Yeah.
[01:16:53.680 --> 01:16:56.040]   Do you have Professor Rosenthal Alves?
[01:16:56.040 --> 01:16:56.800]   You do not.
[01:16:56.800 --> 01:16:59.560]   Oh, Rosenthal Alves is one of the coolest dudes.
[01:16:59.560 --> 01:17:02.720]   Uh-uh.
[01:17:02.720 --> 01:17:05.080]   Did somebody say, what are the Kosta cam?
[01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:07.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:17:07.080 --> 01:17:08.080]   Nice.
[01:17:08.080 --> 01:17:09.840]   Nice, Stacey.
[01:17:09.840 --> 01:17:11.200]   How are you?
[01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:13.200]   I've missed you.
[01:17:13.200 --> 01:17:15.360]   And you too, Jeff.
[01:17:15.360 --> 01:17:16.680]   My hair's gone white.
[01:17:16.680 --> 01:17:21.040]   And this COVID quarantine.
[01:17:21.040 --> 01:17:22.960]   Is that the U-Puppet with a bow tie?
[01:17:22.960 --> 01:17:24.280]   No, this is the-- this is--
[01:17:24.280 --> 01:17:26.040]   I don't know who this is.
[01:17:26.040 --> 01:17:27.000]   It's somebody.
[01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:28.720]   Did you have to fly to bow tie quickly?
[01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:29.220]   No.
[01:17:29.220 --> 01:17:30.040]   Or you already have bow.
[01:17:30.040 --> 01:17:34.280]   This is another-- we have many puppets.
[01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:37.680]   OK, so now, Karsten has to say something on chat that you--
[01:17:37.680 --> 01:17:39.320]   I will channel Karsten.
[01:17:39.320 --> 01:17:40.000]   Exactly.
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:41.040]   You have to channel Karsten.
[01:17:41.040 --> 01:17:41.800]   Where's Karsten?
[01:17:41.800 --> 01:17:43.000]   I don't know if I like this.
[01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:44.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:47.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:48.000]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:49.000]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:50.000]   Karsten, like I can't handle this.
[01:17:50.000 --> 01:17:52.360]   Oh, man.
[01:17:52.360 --> 01:17:54.000]   Oh, Karsten's trying to call.
[01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:54.440]   I know.
[01:17:54.440 --> 01:17:56.120]   Don't answer.
[01:17:56.120 --> 01:17:57.840]   OK, you know what you could do?
[01:17:57.840 --> 01:17:59.280]   Just put his audio up.
[01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:00.360]   Yeah, just his audio.
[01:18:00.360 --> 01:18:02.240]   That's the idea.
[01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:04.160]   Oh, this is going to be interesting.
[01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:05.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:18:05.680 --> 01:18:06.840]   Hey.
[01:18:06.840 --> 01:18:08.200]   Oh, what have we done?
[01:18:08.200 --> 01:18:09.280]   Oh, my God.
[01:18:12.360 --> 01:18:14.960]   This reminds me of the time we got Jason to call somebody.
[01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:18.880]   We called somebody when you were gone, we did two things.
[01:18:18.880 --> 01:18:21.120]   We got Jason to ruin his phone.
[01:18:21.120 --> 01:18:21.480]   Really?
[01:18:21.480 --> 01:18:22.520]   Yeah, and then we tried--
[01:18:22.520 --> 01:18:23.360]   How did you do that?
[01:18:23.360 --> 01:18:24.760]   --was it duo that we tried or M&M?
[01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:25.760]   No, it was F-O.
[01:18:25.760 --> 01:18:26.280]   Oh, God.
[01:18:26.280 --> 01:18:26.880]   Oh, that's right.
[01:18:26.880 --> 01:18:30.200]   It was his Google account that ended up getting screwed up, right?
[01:18:30.200 --> 01:18:31.200]   Yeah.
[01:18:31.200 --> 01:18:31.760]   Or--
[01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:32.680]   Or Jason.
[01:18:32.680 --> 01:18:34.000]   Or Jason.
[01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:37.560]   This dummy-- I mean puppet-- I mean Karsten.
[01:18:37.560 --> 01:18:39.640]   Doesn't have any-- I have to just put his hands here,
[01:18:39.640 --> 01:18:43.360]   because there's no-- you're supposed to be a stick
[01:18:43.360 --> 01:18:44.440]   to control the hands.
[01:18:44.440 --> 01:18:45.920]   So I'm just going to--
[01:18:45.920 --> 01:18:47.120]   I'm just going to let it do that.
[01:18:47.120 --> 01:18:48.160]   Ow, says Karsten.
[01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:49.520]   Ow.
[01:18:49.520 --> 01:18:51.960]   Can you ever-- what are you doing?
[01:18:51.960 --> 01:18:55.280]   All right, let's do answer line three, says Karsten.
[01:18:55.280 --> 01:18:56.280]   Answer line three.
[01:18:56.280 --> 01:18:57.080]   Oh, he's getting angry.
[01:18:57.080 --> 01:18:59.000]   He's typing in caps now.
[01:18:59.000 --> 01:18:59.520]   Yeah.
[01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:01.040]   And next mission points.
[01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:03.800]   Jeff knows who signs his check.
[01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:05.480]   That's the thing.
[01:19:05.480 --> 01:19:07.000]   Apparently Karsten has forgotten.
[01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:09.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:11.200]   I need both hands.
[01:19:11.200 --> 01:19:13.160]   Yeah, we need some Jeff commentary now,
[01:19:13.160 --> 01:19:15.000]   because Jeff's probably with her cursed
[01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:16.040]   under his breath.
[01:19:16.040 --> 01:19:17.840]   But he was just ready for the changelog.
[01:19:17.840 --> 01:19:19.000]   Now he messed up the line.
[01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:20.080]   Not the changelog.
[01:19:20.080 --> 01:19:21.320]   We're going to do the ad.
[01:19:21.320 --> 01:19:23.000]   And then the changelog.
[01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:26.360]   And then we're going to get Karsten, who apparently--
[01:19:26.360 --> 01:19:27.320]   close your mouth.
[01:19:27.320 --> 01:19:28.960]   OK.
[01:19:28.960 --> 01:19:34.320]   This show is brought to you today by Worldwide Technology.
[01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:37.240]   They probably don't want the ad delivered by puppet,
[01:19:37.240 --> 01:19:39.280]   so I'll just do it by myself.
[01:19:39.280 --> 01:19:42.160]   And AppDynamics, together they enable
[01:19:42.160 --> 01:19:45.120]   you to deliver the application experience your customer's
[01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:45.600]   demand.
[01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:48.480]   We've talked so much about the Advanced Technology Center,
[01:19:48.480 --> 01:19:54.040]   the great enterprise delivery that Worldwide Technology does.
[01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:55.400]   But we don't talk much about the fact
[01:19:55.400 --> 01:19:56.640]   that they also do apps.
[01:19:56.640 --> 01:19:59.320]   They can help you do a great app that
[01:19:59.320 --> 01:20:01.280]   will transform your business.
[01:20:01.280 --> 01:20:04.040]   Just great software has the ability to change lives.
[01:20:04.040 --> 01:20:07.840]   And WWT is driven as a custom application design
[01:20:07.840 --> 01:20:08.920]   and development company.
[01:20:08.920 --> 01:20:12.360]   One of many hats WWT wears.
[01:20:12.360 --> 01:20:16.800]   But what I love about WWT is because of their enterprise
[01:20:16.800 --> 01:20:19.120]   background, they know business.
[01:20:19.120 --> 01:20:20.640]   They know your business.
[01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:21.880]   They know how these things work.
[01:20:21.880 --> 01:20:23.040]   So they're going to be able to help
[01:20:23.040 --> 01:20:25.920]   you identify your specific business needs.
[01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:28.080]   They're going to come up with great new approaches
[01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:30.600]   to various problems, create a software solution
[01:20:30.600 --> 01:20:31.400]   that will make an impact.
[01:20:31.400 --> 01:20:34.440]   Maybe you're a restaurant and you need to have online ordering.
[01:20:34.440 --> 01:20:35.800]   There are lots of reasons you might
[01:20:35.800 --> 01:20:37.880]   want to have an app these days.
[01:20:37.880 --> 01:20:40.800]   And you want to-- trust me, we've gone to third parties
[01:20:40.800 --> 01:20:43.880]   get apps done with less than stellar results.
[01:20:43.880 --> 01:20:47.400]   You want a company that focuses on the exact specifications
[01:20:47.400 --> 01:20:48.520]   you want in your app.
[01:20:48.520 --> 01:20:50.480]   And WWT does that.
[01:20:50.480 --> 01:20:52.920]   Their team provides resources and platforms
[01:20:52.920 --> 01:20:54.440]   to make it possible.
[01:20:54.440 --> 01:20:57.040]   The kings of agile development, they really
[01:20:57.040 --> 01:20:58.280]   know how to do it right.
[01:20:58.280 --> 01:21:01.520]   And they have two decades of experience, a proven track
[01:21:01.520 --> 01:21:04.960]   record to truly help you succeed.
[01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:06.760]   So I'll give you a couple of cases.
[01:21:06.760 --> 01:21:09.200]   I won't name names, although we saw the apps when we were there
[01:21:09.200 --> 01:21:11.560]   in St. Louis and I was really blown away.
[01:21:11.560 --> 01:21:15.400]   They worked with a local health care organization
[01:21:15.400 --> 01:21:17.240]   to help connect medical teams from their care
[01:21:17.240 --> 01:21:18.840]   center to patients at home.
[01:21:18.840 --> 01:21:21.840]   So it was a custom software app where care teams could
[01:21:21.840 --> 01:21:23.400]   interface with patients.
[01:21:23.400 --> 01:21:26.080]   And they got great results within a year,
[01:21:26.080 --> 01:21:30.080]   50% reduction in preventable readmissions for--
[01:21:30.080 --> 01:21:32.960]   they call it engagement at home, engagement at home patients.
[01:21:32.960 --> 01:21:36.160]   35% fewer days spent in the hospital,
[01:21:36.160 --> 01:21:37.760]   thanks to virtual care.
[01:21:37.760 --> 01:21:42.000]   60%, 60% fewer septic shock deaths
[01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:45.040]   occurred in patients being treated remotely.
[01:21:45.040 --> 01:21:47.040]   This is huge.
[01:21:47.040 --> 01:21:48.240]   I'll give you another example.
[01:21:48.240 --> 01:21:49.720]   They worked with a rental car company
[01:21:49.720 --> 01:21:52.320]   to produce a mobile app that provided improved customer
[01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:55.280]   car rental experience, lets customers make reservations,
[01:21:55.280 --> 01:21:58.120]   perform check-ins and returns without waiting in line,
[01:21:58.120 --> 01:22:01.800]   and without tying up expensive customer service reps.
[01:22:01.800 --> 01:22:03.640]   They worked with a grocery retailer
[01:22:03.640 --> 01:22:05.320]   to improve their customer experience.
[01:22:05.320 --> 01:22:06.320]   I saw this app.
[01:22:06.320 --> 01:22:06.960]   This is so cool.
[01:22:06.960 --> 01:22:09.420]   Through ideation, innovation, and creative work,
[01:22:09.420 --> 01:22:12.120]   WWT improved their customer experience,
[01:22:12.120 --> 01:22:14.840]   and the grocery retailer hit their two and three year goals
[01:22:14.840 --> 01:22:16.440]   in less than one year.
[01:22:16.440 --> 01:22:20.240]   An app can make a difference if it's done right.
[01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:24.000]   And that's what WWT is so good at.
[01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:25.440]   Put something in your customer's hands
[01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:27.200]   that exceeds their expectation.
[01:22:27.200 --> 01:22:28.400]   They're an agile house.
[01:22:28.400 --> 01:22:29.800]   They do agile software development
[01:22:29.800 --> 01:22:32.960]   from planning and ideation to delivery.
[01:22:32.960 --> 01:22:34.640]   They're faster because of it.
[01:22:34.640 --> 01:22:35.960]   They're more accurate because of it.
[01:22:35.960 --> 01:22:38.960]   They're more responsive to your needs because of it.
[01:22:38.960 --> 01:22:41.400]   If you DevOps, they're going to drive business outcomes
[01:22:41.400 --> 01:22:43.440]   by evaluating, designing, implementing, and operating
[01:22:43.440 --> 01:22:45.720]   with tools to enhance your operational efficiency.
[01:22:45.720 --> 01:22:47.440]   Yeah, they do DevOps.
[01:22:47.440 --> 01:22:50.160]   Container platforms, they rapidly
[01:22:50.160 --> 01:22:52.760]   create services that can scale and perform
[01:22:52.760 --> 01:22:54.800]   by designing and architecting and implementing
[01:22:54.800 --> 01:22:58.440]   cloud native apps in an agile fashion in containers.
[01:22:58.440 --> 01:23:02.160]   That's just a small sampling of the skill set
[01:23:02.160 --> 01:23:04.120]   WWT brings to the table.
[01:23:04.120 --> 01:23:07.160]   They can solve your toughest challenges.
[01:23:07.160 --> 01:23:10.200]   Transform your business today with worldwide technology.
[01:23:10.200 --> 01:23:13.120]   In so many areas, WWT is a partner
[01:23:13.120 --> 01:23:15.640]   you'll keep going back to for years.
[01:23:15.640 --> 01:23:18.680]   They can help you change your business with apps
[01:23:18.680 --> 01:23:20.960]   that help you, that yield great user experiences,
[01:23:20.960 --> 01:23:23.720]   attract new clients, increase customer value,
[01:23:23.720 --> 01:23:25.440]   and they are just such great people.
[01:23:25.440 --> 01:23:29.760]   WWT.com/twit1WWT.
[01:23:29.760 --> 01:23:34.760]   Delivering business outcomes and modernizing IT infrastructure.
[01:23:34.760 --> 01:23:40.440]   Thank you, WWT, for supporting this week in Google.
[01:23:40.440 --> 01:23:44.560]   And you are supporting us when you go to WWT.com/twit1.
[01:23:44.560 --> 01:23:45.800]   Thank you.
[01:23:45.800 --> 01:23:49.640]   It's time for the Google Change Log.
[01:23:49.640 --> 01:23:55.640]   Ta-da!
[01:23:58.280 --> 01:24:01.320]   Now, some new things in the Goog.
[01:24:01.320 --> 01:24:04.720]   Google's rebanding Hangouts chat.
[01:24:04.720 --> 01:24:08.520]   I don't know why even do stories about Hangouts anymore.
[01:24:08.520 --> 01:24:11.560]   Just endless.
[01:24:11.560 --> 01:24:15.680]   So it's just gonna be Google Chat and Google Meet.
[01:24:15.680 --> 01:24:17.240]   And they're taking the word Hangouts out.
[01:24:17.240 --> 01:24:19.560]   So I don't know if this is just yet another reason
[01:24:19.560 --> 01:24:21.960]   to think Hangouts is dead.
[01:24:21.960 --> 01:24:23.080]   - Is this for everyone?
[01:24:23.080 --> 01:24:25.400]   The G Suite customers and normal people?
[01:24:25.400 --> 01:24:26.240]   - Just G Suite.
[01:24:26.240 --> 01:24:28.880]   There never was a Google Hangouts chat
[01:24:28.880 --> 01:24:31.800]   or Hangouts Meet for regular people, was there?
[01:24:31.800 --> 01:24:33.640]   - You just called it Hangouts.
[01:24:33.640 --> 01:24:35.000]   - There's Hangouts.
[01:24:35.000 --> 01:24:36.240]   It's just Hangouts.
[01:24:36.240 --> 01:24:37.400]   And that's still around.
[01:24:37.400 --> 01:24:38.640]   Yeah, don't believe me.
[01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:40.640]   This is confusing enough.
[01:24:40.640 --> 01:24:41.480]   - Whoa!
[01:24:41.480 --> 01:24:46.800]   - So yeah, they're changing the name of Hangouts
[01:24:46.800 --> 01:24:49.280]   but only for G Suite customers.
[01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:51.960]   Frankly, I think they think nobody uses Hangouts anymore.
[01:24:51.960 --> 01:24:53.120]   I use it.
[01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:54.720]   We Google-- - I use it all the time.
[01:24:54.720 --> 01:24:57.400]   - I know, it's the only cross platform solution.
[01:24:57.400 --> 01:25:01.480]   - Google, why are you so googly?
[01:25:01.480 --> 01:25:04.200]   - They did a while ago and it frustrates me no end.
[01:25:04.200 --> 01:25:06.160]   Turn off the ability to make Hangouts
[01:25:06.160 --> 01:25:09.760]   the default SMS application on my Pixel.
[01:25:09.760 --> 01:25:12.000]   So that's, I mean, that's the beginning of the end.
[01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:13.600]   It's just so frustrating.
[01:25:13.600 --> 01:25:17.680]   And yet Google Fi's text message is still go to Hangouts.
[01:25:17.680 --> 01:25:19.040]   So you tell me--
[01:25:19.040 --> 01:25:21.480]   - I can't tell you.
[01:25:21.480 --> 01:25:22.920]   - I can't tell you. - I just don't know.
[01:25:22.920 --> 01:25:25.880]   Google phone can now be installed.
[01:25:25.880 --> 01:25:28.120]   I don't know why you'd want to on non-pixel phones
[01:25:28.120 --> 01:25:28.880]   from the Play Store.
[01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:31.720]   They put the phone in the Play Store.
[01:25:31.720 --> 01:25:36.560]   And I guess it works since every phone comes with its own,
[01:25:36.560 --> 01:25:38.440]   you know, phone icon and phone dialer.
[01:25:38.440 --> 01:25:39.920]   I don't know why you'd want the Google phone.
[01:25:39.920 --> 01:25:41.360]   It's not that great.
[01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:43.880]   - You used to change dialers all the time.
[01:25:43.880 --> 01:25:45.040]   - Really?
[01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:45.880]   - You did. - Oh God, yeah.
[01:25:45.880 --> 01:25:48.280]   You were all prideful about how you changed dialers all the time.
[01:25:48.280 --> 01:25:50.120]   I've got this great dialer-- - Don't get lunch or--
[01:25:50.120 --> 01:25:51.440]   - Don't get lunch or whatever, and I always say--
[01:25:51.440 --> 01:25:53.480]   - That's lunch or not dialers.
[01:25:53.480 --> 01:25:55.640]   - Oh dialers. - Launchers is the front page.
[01:25:55.640 --> 01:25:57.760]   - Never mind. - Dialers is a little phone icon.
[01:25:57.760 --> 01:25:59.360]   - Never mind. - Okay.
[01:25:59.360 --> 01:26:00.200]   - Oh, okay.
[01:26:00.200 --> 01:26:01.200]   I don't know why you would want it,
[01:26:01.200 --> 01:26:04.760]   but apparently you can install it on your phone.
[01:26:04.760 --> 01:26:06.440]   Maybe people will just like it better.
[01:26:06.440 --> 01:26:10.520]   It's designated as beta on the Google Play Store.
[01:26:10.520 --> 01:26:12.240]   Phone beta.
[01:26:12.240 --> 01:26:15.480]   Maybe there's features that, I don't know,
[01:26:15.480 --> 01:26:17.000]   maybe there's features that, I don't know,
[01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:18.640]   I've always used pixel phones.
[01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:23.640]   Google app is rolling out Google app.
[01:26:23.640 --> 01:26:26.680]   I don't know what this headline means.
[01:26:26.680 --> 01:26:29.160]   Google app rolling out search tools time
[01:26:29.160 --> 01:26:31.560]   verbatim filtering on Android.
[01:26:31.560 --> 01:26:32.920]   - If you had carsten on the phone,
[01:26:32.920 --> 01:26:33.920]   you could probably ask people enough.
[01:26:33.920 --> 01:26:35.040]   - Oh, I still don't. - You don't.
[01:26:35.040 --> 01:26:36.080]   - He put this one in.
[01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:38.760]   From a home screen widget to assistant integration,
[01:26:38.760 --> 01:26:40.600]   oh, there is an app called the Google app.
[01:26:40.600 --> 01:26:42.620]   Yeah, the Google app is how the company
[01:26:42.620 --> 01:26:45.040]   wants you to search on Android.
[01:26:45.040 --> 01:26:46.640]   Well, but who does that?
[01:26:46.640 --> 01:26:47.840]   No one.
[01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:49.200]   It's always lacked one key feature
[01:26:49.200 --> 01:26:50.280]   compared to the mobile experience.
[01:26:50.280 --> 01:26:53.000]   The Google app beta yesterday finally added search tools
[01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.280]   and filters on Android.
[01:26:55.280 --> 01:26:58.200]   Oh, you know, I use that all the time at Google.com
[01:26:58.200 --> 01:27:01.440]   where you could choose to look at the answers
[01:27:01.440 --> 01:27:02.640]   in news, images, shopping.
[01:27:02.640 --> 01:27:03.680]   - Yeah, I love that.
[01:27:03.680 --> 01:27:04.520]   - The tools.
[01:27:04.520 --> 01:27:05.360]   - You can do that here?
[01:27:05.360 --> 01:27:06.720]   - Yeah, the tools let you do time.
[01:27:06.720 --> 01:27:07.800]   - Don't you think you're doing that here?
[01:27:07.800 --> 01:27:08.640]   - I guess not.
[01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:10.360]   I never use it.
[01:27:10.360 --> 01:27:14.560]   So the advanced tools, you hit search tools
[01:27:14.560 --> 01:27:17.720]   and you can choose what timeframe the search is in
[01:27:17.720 --> 01:27:18.640]   because I use that all the time
[01:27:18.640 --> 01:27:20.680]   'cause I don't want a two year old article
[01:27:20.680 --> 01:27:22.480]   about Google's chip ambitions.
[01:27:22.480 --> 01:27:25.600]   I want one in the past 24 hours or past week.
[01:27:25.600 --> 01:27:27.000]   So that's now there.
[01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:30.440]   You can also, or you could even do custom ranges if you want.
[01:27:30.440 --> 01:27:33.880]   And you can also do either all results
[01:27:33.880 --> 01:27:35.120]   or verbatim results.
[01:27:35.120 --> 01:27:37.840]   Now, I didn't really need that 'cause verbatim,
[01:27:37.840 --> 01:27:38.800]   I just put it in quotes.
[01:27:38.800 --> 01:27:40.080]   That does the same thing I think,
[01:27:40.080 --> 01:27:43.320]   but unless I'm misunderstanding it.
[01:27:43.320 --> 01:27:44.760]   Anyway, that's, you know, it's,
[01:27:44.760 --> 01:27:47.700]   this is the kind of thing you get in the Google change log.
[01:27:47.700 --> 01:27:48.540]   I'm just saying.
[01:27:48.540 --> 01:27:50.760]   It may not be a big deal.
[01:27:50.760 --> 01:27:52.560]   It's just in the change log.
[01:27:52.560 --> 01:27:56.360]   YouTube's desktop site is now more touchscreen friendly.
[01:27:56.360 --> 01:27:58.560]   That has always bugged me.
[01:27:58.560 --> 01:28:03.400]   It's so hard to scroll around and all of it.
[01:28:03.400 --> 01:28:05.600]   They've updated the desktop site.
[01:28:05.600 --> 01:28:09.200]   So you can, they've got tweaked the three dot menu.
[01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:11.680]   They've enlarged icons.
[01:28:11.680 --> 01:28:13.960]   I've always found it hard to scrub in it,
[01:28:13.960 --> 01:28:16.320]   but I guess I don't know if that's part of the update
[01:28:16.320 --> 01:28:18.140]   or not, I'll have to play with it.
[01:28:18.140 --> 01:28:20.420]   YouTube's latest update also includes improvement
[01:28:20.420 --> 01:28:22.500]   to watch history, which now tells you
[01:28:22.500 --> 01:28:25.260]   which videos you watched on a particular day or date.
[01:28:25.260 --> 01:28:28.540]   Oh, isn't that nice?
[01:28:28.540 --> 01:28:30.740]   Additionally, there's a way to organize your playlists
[01:28:30.740 --> 01:28:33.700]   with a move to the top bottom option.
[01:28:33.700 --> 01:28:35.420]   So you don't have to drag and drop videos.
[01:28:35.420 --> 01:28:39.120]   You can move them to the top or move them to the bottom.
[01:28:39.120 --> 01:28:42.100]   And that's exciting.
[01:28:42.100 --> 01:28:45.420]   - You almost had Jeff hit the bottom.
[01:28:45.420 --> 01:28:47.620]   - I know, I was trying to, I was trying to,
[01:28:47.620 --> 01:28:49.540]   I was trying to, and that was cruel.
[01:28:49.540 --> 01:28:51.340]   - No, he knows, we get a lot more.
[01:28:51.340 --> 01:28:53.540]   Equally exciting.
[01:28:53.540 --> 01:28:57.540]   Google will show virtual care options more prominently
[01:28:57.540 --> 01:28:58.960]   in search results.
[01:28:58.960 --> 01:29:03.900]   The blog post said that over the coming week,
[01:29:03.900 --> 01:29:06.820]   it'll be easy to find telehealth services.
[01:29:06.820 --> 01:29:09.260]   In other words, not care options that require you
[01:29:09.260 --> 01:29:12.600]   to go somewhere, but stuff you can do virtually.
[01:29:13.740 --> 01:29:16.060]   They'll show up higher now in the search options
[01:29:16.060 --> 01:29:18.300]   'cause that's what we want you to do.
[01:29:18.300 --> 01:29:20.700]   We don't want you to get in the car.
[01:29:20.700 --> 01:29:22.620]   Stay home.
[01:29:22.620 --> 01:29:25.800]   Scooter X is way ahead of me.
[01:29:25.800 --> 01:29:30.500]   Google develops a virtual Braille keyboard for Android.
[01:29:30.500 --> 01:29:33.800]   It's rolling out, you may not have it right away,
[01:29:33.800 --> 01:29:35.460]   but this is really interesting.
[01:29:35.460 --> 01:29:36.300]   So,
[01:29:36.300 --> 01:29:43.020]   there are six buttons on it and you have to cord them
[01:29:43.900 --> 01:29:47.500]   and you can, for instance, if you just tap the first,
[01:29:47.500 --> 01:29:51.700]   if dot one, that's A, dot one and dot two or B,
[01:29:51.700 --> 01:29:56.140]   dot one two and four are C, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:29:56.140 --> 01:30:00.300]   This is grade one or grade two Braille.
[01:30:00.300 --> 01:30:05.420]   Makes it easier for, yeah, I think that's cool.
[01:30:05.420 --> 01:30:08.100]   It's part of the Android Accessibility Suite.
[01:30:08.100 --> 01:30:08.940]   - Mm-hmm.
[01:30:08.940 --> 01:30:10.700]   - Android five, no, it's cool.
[01:30:10.700 --> 01:30:11.540]   - Yeah.
[01:30:11.540 --> 01:30:13.020]   - So, this is for,
[01:30:13.020 --> 01:30:17.580]   they're typing this to--
[01:30:17.580 --> 01:30:20.180]   - You would show, I would guess you would show somebody.
[01:30:20.180 --> 01:30:21.220]   You would hold it up.
[01:30:21.220 --> 01:30:23.260]   I don't know.
[01:30:23.260 --> 01:30:24.780]   - Ah, no.
[01:30:24.780 --> 01:30:25.900]   - No. - No.
[01:30:25.900 --> 01:30:27.900]   - No, 'cause you couldn't show someone if they're blind
[01:30:27.900 --> 01:30:30.900]   or are you blind, if you're blind typing it
[01:30:30.900 --> 01:30:33.500]   and you're showing someone what you're trying to spell.
[01:30:33.500 --> 01:30:36.900]   - No, this says, it says, it's hard to,
[01:30:36.900 --> 01:30:39.860]   you can attach a keyboard, but it's hard,
[01:30:39.860 --> 01:30:40.700]   it's time consuming.
[01:30:40.700 --> 01:30:44.140]   You just wanted to do a quick type answer to somebody
[01:30:44.140 --> 01:30:45.420]   that you use this.
[01:30:45.420 --> 01:30:46.780]   - Yes, if you're blind.
[01:30:46.780 --> 01:30:48.340]   - I got very confused too, I'm not gonna say--
[01:30:48.340 --> 01:30:49.260]   - If you're blind, if you're low vision,
[01:30:49.260 --> 01:30:51.980]   oh, I hear a sound that sounds like Karsten.
[01:30:51.980 --> 01:30:54.860]   Google completely ruined, we talked about this last week,
[01:30:54.860 --> 01:30:58.180]   the shared folders thing, now a review.
[01:30:58.180 --> 01:31:00.660]   Google completely ruined, this is from Android Police,
[01:31:00.660 --> 01:31:02.340]   shared folders and drive.
[01:31:02.340 --> 01:31:05.220]   This is that thing where they're starting,
[01:31:05.220 --> 01:31:08.100]   instead of having duplicate files,
[01:31:08.100 --> 01:31:12.220]   they're doing shortcuts, I don't even,
[01:31:12.220 --> 01:31:16.020]   just read the article, I don't even wanna, I know.
[01:31:16.020 --> 01:31:17.220]   Google's-- - We're not into that.
[01:31:17.220 --> 01:31:18.940]   - And this you'll be so happy, Jeff.
[01:31:18.940 --> 01:31:21.580]   Google is finally bringing dark mode
[01:31:21.580 --> 01:31:23.820]   to the YouTube TV app on Android.
[01:31:23.820 --> 01:31:25.500]   Hallelujah. - That's a nice version.
[01:31:25.500 --> 01:31:27.060]   - Carson, but there's some Carson's forget it,
[01:31:27.060 --> 01:31:28.860]   you're off the air. - No, it's good.
[01:31:28.860 --> 01:31:30.020]   (laughing)
[01:31:30.020 --> 01:31:32.180]   - For TV, 'cause it gives you a slightly more--
[01:31:32.180 --> 01:31:33.940]   - We should be able to hear Carson.
[01:31:33.940 --> 01:31:34.780]   - Oh.
[01:31:34.780 --> 01:31:35.780]   (laughing)
[01:31:35.780 --> 01:31:37.060]   - Like Karsten.
[01:31:37.060 --> 01:31:39.340]   - Hello. - Hello.
[01:31:39.340 --> 01:31:40.180]   - We can hear you. - Is that Karsten?
[01:31:40.180 --> 01:31:41.820]   - Can you hear me? - Yeah, let me--
[01:31:41.820 --> 01:31:43.740]   - Yes. - Let me embody him though.
[01:31:43.740 --> 01:31:45.420]   Go ahead, Karsten.
[01:31:45.420 --> 01:31:46.340]   - Hello.
[01:31:46.340 --> 01:31:51.060]   I'm calling you from my mountain lair
[01:31:51.060 --> 01:31:53.140]   in the leftovers of the East Bay.
[01:31:53.140 --> 01:31:56.420]   And apparently I am orange.
[01:31:56.420 --> 01:31:57.900]   (laughing)
[01:31:57.900 --> 01:32:00.020]   - But you are wearing a nice bowtie, Karsten.
[01:32:00.020 --> 01:32:03.260]   And a ruffled shirt I might add.
[01:32:03.260 --> 01:32:04.380]   - Yes. - And what is that?
[01:32:04.380 --> 01:32:07.180]   Is that a robe of some smoking jacket?
[01:32:07.180 --> 01:32:08.420]   Is that what it is?
[01:32:08.420 --> 01:32:10.340]   - It is a smoking jacket. - Smoking jacket.
[01:32:10.340 --> 01:32:11.580]   - Excellent. - Looks like the shirt's
[01:32:11.580 --> 01:32:13.060]   coming out, I'll tuck it in here for you.
[01:32:13.060 --> 01:32:15.100]   - Yes, that is not proper.
[01:32:15.100 --> 01:32:19.100]   - I'm so proud of myself. - Well, this is really
[01:32:19.100 --> 01:32:20.100]   taking me-- - I'm so proud of myself.
[01:32:20.100 --> 01:32:21.820]   - This is taking those Zoom effects
[01:32:21.820 --> 01:32:23.340]   to a whole new level, Karsten.
[01:32:23.340 --> 01:32:24.500]   (laughing)
[01:32:24.500 --> 01:32:26.500]   - I feel that just having a puppet or something.
[01:32:26.500 --> 01:32:29.340]   - Yes. (laughing)
[01:32:31.780 --> 01:32:34.020]   - I have been showing up to all of our meetings
[01:32:34.020 --> 01:32:38.100]   in as a potato or a piece of bacon or a night elf.
[01:32:38.100 --> 01:32:39.460]   Or a glowing cloud.
[01:32:39.460 --> 01:32:41.540]   - Yeah, you were a glowing cloud yesterday.
[01:32:41.540 --> 01:32:42.540]   That was interesting.
[01:32:42.540 --> 01:32:45.100]   You looked radioactive. - Yes.
[01:32:45.100 --> 01:32:49.060]   - Now, you just look like you had too many carrots.
[01:32:49.060 --> 01:32:49.900]   - Yep.
[01:32:49.900 --> 01:32:52.460]   - Boy, you're doing a great job.
[01:32:52.460 --> 01:32:53.300]   (laughing)
[01:32:53.300 --> 01:32:56.100]   - Also, you don't blink much, do you?
[01:32:56.100 --> 01:32:56.940]   - No.
[01:32:56.940 --> 01:32:59.540]   Too much caffeine.
[01:32:59.540 --> 01:33:01.780]   (laughing)
[01:33:01.780 --> 01:33:07.300]   - All right, okay, so pro dark mode, except for Jeff.
[01:33:07.300 --> 01:33:09.340]   - Yeah, I think it's a good idea.
[01:33:09.340 --> 01:33:11.940]   - Me too. - I think TV should be dark.
[01:33:11.940 --> 01:33:13.180]   You don't wanna bright big white--
[01:33:13.180 --> 01:33:14.180]   - Absolutely.
[01:33:14.180 --> 01:33:15.580]   - He agrees to.
[01:33:15.580 --> 01:33:16.820]   Karsten and puppet agrees.
[01:33:16.820 --> 01:33:18.500]   - He does that just to be mean to me.
[01:33:18.500 --> 01:33:22.140]   - Google Drive is rolling out an updated document scanner UI
[01:33:22.140 --> 01:33:23.860]   with better iconography.
[01:33:23.860 --> 01:33:27.740]   Thank you for putting these in here, Karsten.
[01:33:27.740 --> 01:33:29.300]   'Cause I didn't even notice any of this.
[01:33:29.300 --> 01:33:32.660]   Google reduce, oh, I did see this one.
[01:33:32.660 --> 01:33:35.860]   So if you have a Nest camera, it uses a lot of data
[01:33:35.860 --> 01:33:37.020]   'cause it's high def.
[01:33:37.020 --> 01:33:38.260]   I mean, you could turn it down,
[01:33:38.260 --> 01:33:40.220]   but Google is going to now unilaterally
[01:33:40.220 --> 01:33:44.220]   reduce Nest camera quality to ease burden on networks.
[01:33:44.220 --> 01:33:47.860]   And-- - You can opt back into it
[01:33:47.860 --> 01:33:49.420]   if you do decide you need the A-shape.
[01:33:49.420 --> 01:33:51.020]   - Oh, you can turn it up, okay.
[01:33:51.020 --> 01:33:51.860]   - You can.
[01:33:51.860 --> 01:33:53.780]   - It's the same thing as having the default
[01:33:53.780 --> 01:33:55.700]   before ADP on YouTube.
[01:33:55.700 --> 01:33:58.660]   Most people just don't even notice and go with it.
[01:33:58.660 --> 01:34:00.820]   - Yeah, well, and it's mostly because, you know,
[01:34:00.820 --> 01:34:02.940]   there's so much happening over your home network right now,
[01:34:02.940 --> 01:34:04.220]   anyway, so.
[01:34:04.220 --> 01:34:06.860]   - And we had announced some time ago
[01:34:06.860 --> 01:34:09.260]   that Google was gonna remove the ability
[01:34:09.260 --> 01:34:13.820]   to support FTP services in Chrome.
[01:34:13.820 --> 01:34:15.500]   I think Firefox did that as well.
[01:34:15.500 --> 01:34:18.620]   It used to be you could type in a browser FTP colon slash
[01:34:18.620 --> 01:34:21.300]   slash in an FTP site and you'd get the site
[01:34:21.300 --> 01:34:23.420]   and download files and so forth.
[01:34:23.420 --> 01:34:26.900]   Thanks to the pandemic, they're gonna leave it in.
[01:34:26.900 --> 01:34:27.740]   - Yay!
[01:34:27.740 --> 01:34:28.580]   - It's coming with stuff is there.
[01:34:28.580 --> 01:34:29.660]   - I love what I like, put this in there.
[01:34:29.660 --> 01:34:32.460]   What I love about it is they call it the venerable--
[01:34:32.460 --> 01:34:34.380]   - The venerable FTP.
[01:34:34.380 --> 01:34:37.700]   - FTP file transfer protocol.
[01:34:37.700 --> 01:34:39.340]   Carson, you can do the honors.
[01:34:39.340 --> 01:34:41.820]   - Which honors?
[01:34:41.820 --> 01:34:45.980]   Oh, and that's the Google change log.
[01:34:45.980 --> 01:34:50.900]   (loud whooshing)
[01:34:50.900 --> 01:34:53.300]   - Jesus, man, we set you up and we got it right.
[01:34:53.300 --> 01:34:55.020]   (laughing)
[01:34:55.020 --> 01:34:56.660]   I blame you for this, Jeff.
[01:34:56.660 --> 01:34:57.500]   - Yeah, you should.
[01:34:57.500 --> 01:34:59.060]   - I really can see issues.
[01:34:59.060 --> 01:35:00.780]   - Come on, you Jeff for this too.
[01:35:00.780 --> 01:35:02.260]   (laughing)
[01:35:02.260 --> 01:35:03.580]   - He's talking down there.
[01:35:03.580 --> 01:35:08.460]   - All right, what else we wanna talk about?
[01:35:08.460 --> 01:35:09.300]   - TikTok.
[01:35:09.300 --> 01:35:12.260]   One billion installs on the Play Store.
[01:35:12.260 --> 01:35:13.740]   One billion.
[01:35:13.740 --> 01:35:16.660]   I talked to a friend of mine in the office.
[01:35:16.660 --> 01:35:18.980]   TikTok finally told her you've been on TikTok too long.
[01:35:18.980 --> 01:35:19.820]   Get off.
[01:35:19.820 --> 01:35:22.500]   Oh my God, you could do that?
[01:35:22.500 --> 01:35:23.340]   - Yeah, evidently.
[01:35:23.340 --> 01:35:24.180]   - That's nice.
[01:35:24.180 --> 01:35:25.020]   - She was on for like two hours.
[01:35:25.020 --> 01:35:26.980]   - Sometimes people just sit there, you get kind of stone
[01:35:26.980 --> 01:35:29.500]   and you just scroll and scroll and scroll.
[01:35:29.500 --> 01:35:35.460]   Quibi had 1.7 million downloads in the first week.
[01:35:35.460 --> 01:35:36.980]   And they've, you know,
[01:35:36.980 --> 01:35:39.740]   (laughing)
[01:35:39.740 --> 01:35:40.580]   one of the things I didn't--
[01:35:40.580 --> 01:35:41.420]   - I'm sorry.
[01:35:41.420 --> 01:35:44.420]   - You opened TikTok.
[01:35:44.420 --> 01:35:46.020]   One of the things-- - Sorry, I've lost you
[01:35:46.020 --> 01:35:46.860]   now.
[01:35:46.860 --> 01:35:48.660]   - Yeah, see, this is the problem, it's so addictive.
[01:35:48.660 --> 01:35:50.300]   - Goodbye, Jeff.
[01:35:50.300 --> 01:35:51.380]   - He's scrolling.
[01:35:51.380 --> 01:35:52.580]   He's scrolling.
[01:35:52.580 --> 01:35:53.900]   - Yeah, scrolling, scrolling, scrolling.
[01:35:53.900 --> 01:35:56.460]   - Oh, oh, baby, you're the dog.
[01:35:56.460 --> 01:35:59.220]   - Oh, I got the better one.
[01:35:59.220 --> 01:36:01.300]   - That was better, okay, yeah.
[01:36:01.300 --> 01:36:04.980]   - Wait for the end, it always told me to wait for the end.
[01:36:04.980 --> 01:36:05.820]   - Geez.
[01:36:05.820 --> 01:36:08.020]   - I'm done with money.
[01:36:08.020 --> 01:36:08.860]   - They do, they do, they do.
[01:36:08.860 --> 01:36:09.780]   - They all say wait for the end
[01:36:09.780 --> 01:36:11.020]   and then nothing happens in the end.
[01:36:11.020 --> 01:36:11.860]   - It really happens.
[01:36:11.860 --> 01:36:12.700]   - And it's like really frustrating.
[01:36:12.700 --> 01:36:13.540]   - And I'm sick of the talking dogs.
[01:36:13.540 --> 01:36:14.380]   - I'm sick of them.
[01:36:14.380 --> 01:36:16.300]   - I actually have the capability of just standing
[01:36:16.300 --> 01:36:17.980]   Carson on the table like that.
[01:36:17.980 --> 01:36:19.580]   - With no legs, oh he's so sick.
[01:36:19.580 --> 01:36:21.420]   - Well, his legs go underneath the table.
[01:36:21.420 --> 01:36:22.580]   He's actually in a hole.
[01:36:25.700 --> 01:36:28.420]   - He's upstaging Stacy and she does not like it.
[01:36:28.420 --> 01:36:29.900]   - Oh no, that's fine.
[01:36:29.900 --> 01:36:31.940]   Carson gets it right there.
[01:36:31.940 --> 01:36:33.020]   - No, no, no, no.
[01:36:33.020 --> 01:36:34.620]   I have way less ego than Jeff.
[01:36:34.620 --> 01:36:35.700]   - No, no, no, no, no.
[01:36:35.700 --> 01:36:36.540]   - Oh, oh, oh.
[01:36:36.540 --> 01:36:37.380]   - Oh, Stacy.
[01:36:37.380 --> 01:36:42.020]   - Now if only Carson could punch Leo.
[01:36:42.020 --> 01:36:45.660]   - We're working on that capability.
[01:36:45.660 --> 01:36:47.620]   - There we go.
[01:36:47.620 --> 01:36:48.460]   - You can put a good slap.
[01:36:48.460 --> 01:36:50.540]   - Here, put your hand here, you can pinch me.
[01:36:55.060 --> 01:37:00.260]   - I think you can now sue him,
[01:37:00.260 --> 01:37:01.100]   Carson.
[01:37:01.100 --> 01:37:02.100]   (laughs)
[01:37:02.100 --> 01:37:02.940]   - Okay.
[01:37:02.940 --> 01:37:03.940]   - Quibi, has anybody watched Quibi?
[01:37:03.940 --> 01:37:08.740]   Jeffrey Katzenberg, Meg Whitman, short video attempt
[01:37:08.740 --> 01:37:11.500]   by Hollywood to co-op the YouTube crowd.
[01:37:11.500 --> 01:37:12.740]   - Because I mean--
[01:37:12.740 --> 01:37:14.460]   - One of the things that frustrated me was that you
[01:37:14.460 --> 01:37:17.100]   couldn't, you had to watch on the phone.
[01:37:17.100 --> 01:37:19.460]   They didn't have an iPad version and you couldn't
[01:37:19.460 --> 01:37:21.820]   airplay it or cast it in any way,
[01:37:21.820 --> 01:37:23.380]   Chromecast or anything to your TV.
[01:37:23.380 --> 01:37:26.220]   It would just, it would just, it would block it.
[01:37:26.220 --> 01:37:28.820]   And now they say, oh, that was a feature we were gonna add
[01:37:28.820 --> 01:37:30.420]   later, we'll add it now.
[01:37:30.420 --> 01:37:32.300]   'Cause of coronavirus.
[01:37:32.300 --> 01:37:34.100]   - Yeah, 'cause no one else is going anywhere
[01:37:34.100 --> 01:37:35.140]   needing their short-term business.
[01:37:35.140 --> 01:37:36.740]   - There's Carson!
[01:37:36.740 --> 01:37:40.300]   This is, go ahead, make yourself a glowing vegetable.
[01:37:40.300 --> 01:37:41.140]   - Oh!
[01:37:41.140 --> 01:37:43.020]   - Do something, do something fun.
[01:37:43.020 --> 01:37:44.300]   - Great lighting there, Carson.
[01:37:44.300 --> 01:37:45.660]   Geez, rape my--
[01:37:45.660 --> 01:37:46.900]   - Sorry, I've scotched--
[01:37:46.900 --> 01:37:51.900]   - I'm in my mountain lair with a beautiful scenery behind me.
[01:37:52.820 --> 01:37:56.340]   If I get COVID-19 from handling your puppet,
[01:37:56.340 --> 01:37:57.340]   I'll be upset.
[01:37:57.340 --> 01:38:00.300]   - We would all be upset.
[01:38:00.300 --> 01:38:02.300]   - I didn't even think of this.
[01:38:02.300 --> 01:38:04.460]   The World Health Organization,
[01:38:04.460 --> 01:38:07.020]   remember Apple announced a COVID-19,
[01:38:07.020 --> 01:38:09.260]   a release to COVID-19 for the iPhone?
[01:38:09.260 --> 01:38:12.820]   There is now official one from the World Health Organization.
[01:38:12.820 --> 01:38:17.820]   It's a who COVID-19 tips app, both Android and iOS.
[01:38:17.820 --> 01:38:20.780]   I don't know if the world needed this,
[01:38:22.300 --> 01:38:24.100]   but now the world has it.
[01:38:24.100 --> 01:38:28.020]   - Why do we need this, I wonder?
[01:38:28.020 --> 01:38:30.580]   They do have a section called Who Mythbusters?
[01:38:30.580 --> 01:38:34.460]   Unfortunately, Adam Savage is not on that.
[01:38:34.460 --> 01:38:37.340]   - Is Adam Savage part of this?
[01:38:37.340 --> 01:38:39.300]   - But I think that's probably necessary.
[01:38:39.300 --> 01:38:41.860]   That's probably needed, right?
[01:38:41.860 --> 01:38:43.660]   Jeff, would the World Health Organization
[01:38:43.660 --> 01:38:45.980]   be on your list of trusted authorities?
[01:38:45.980 --> 01:38:47.140]   - Yes. - Okay.
[01:38:47.140 --> 01:38:48.540]   - No, certainly.
[01:38:48.540 --> 01:38:50.020]   - The president's been a little critical of them.
[01:38:50.020 --> 01:38:52.180]   In fact, I think he's withholding funding.
[01:38:52.180 --> 01:38:54.140]   - Yep. - Perfect timing, right?
[01:38:54.140 --> 01:38:56.540]   That's the one you wanna withhold funding.
[01:38:56.540 --> 01:38:58.940]   Because, well, I understand his upset
[01:38:58.940 --> 01:39:00.860]   because the World Health Organization
[01:39:00.860 --> 01:39:04.820]   seems to be a little careful not to offend China,
[01:39:04.820 --> 01:39:07.340]   not that the president would ever do that.
[01:39:07.340 --> 01:39:09.100]   - About exactly.
[01:39:09.100 --> 01:39:14.100]   - But, so there is some question about,
[01:39:14.100 --> 01:39:17.100]   and I think Taiwan particularly was upset
[01:39:17.100 --> 01:39:19.380]   with the World Health Organization,
[01:39:19.380 --> 01:39:22.540]   that they are being a little bit overly judicious
[01:39:22.540 --> 01:39:23.820]   of China's feelings.
[01:39:23.820 --> 01:39:25.420]   But, you know what, China's a big country.
[01:39:25.420 --> 01:39:29.260]   You gotta be, you gotta take it all into account.
[01:39:29.260 --> 01:39:35.660]   Verizon, wow, says it's handling 800 million
[01:39:35.660 --> 01:39:39.300]   wireless calls on weekdays.
[01:39:39.300 --> 01:39:42.420]   That's more than they handle on Mother's Day,
[01:39:42.420 --> 01:39:47.420]   which used to be the busiest call day of the year.
[01:39:47.660 --> 01:39:50.580]   - So I wanna talk to people using my voice
[01:39:50.580 --> 01:39:53.060]   as opposed to constantly texting them.
[01:39:53.060 --> 01:39:55.780]   And by God, none of my friends will talk to me.
[01:39:55.780 --> 01:39:57.380]   - On the phone. - They'll text me all day long.
[01:39:57.380 --> 01:39:59.060]   None of them will talk to me on the phone.
[01:39:59.060 --> 01:40:00.620]   It is so weird to-- - You're talking to bots,
[01:40:00.620 --> 01:40:01.620]   that's why.
[01:40:01.620 --> 01:40:02.540]   You're not talking to your friends,
[01:40:02.540 --> 01:40:04.060]   you're talking to bots, I hate to tell you a statement.
[01:40:04.060 --> 01:40:05.220]   - What about video calls?
[01:40:05.220 --> 01:40:09.660]   I thought that that was the preferred way in the modern age.
[01:40:09.660 --> 01:40:12.500]   - I am too talking to my friends.
[01:40:12.500 --> 01:40:15.340]   - No, they're all using Google Auto Complete.
[01:40:15.340 --> 01:40:17.420]   - Oh, no, they're not. - They don't wanna talk
[01:40:17.420 --> 01:40:19.380]   to you, they just say Google, talk to her.
[01:40:19.380 --> 01:40:23.300]   - Wait, wait, all the ones that are yes, or thumbs up.
[01:40:23.300 --> 01:40:24.940]   - Yeah, right, see? - That sounds good.
[01:40:24.940 --> 01:40:27.020]   - You're talking to bots, I told you.
[01:40:27.020 --> 01:40:29.620]   - Verizon said the length of phone calls is up
[01:40:29.620 --> 01:40:31.980]   by about a third as well on the average day.
[01:40:31.980 --> 01:40:34.020]   - 'Cause you got nothing else to do, man.
[01:40:34.020 --> 01:40:37.860]   - And the number of cellular calls for AT&T is up 35%.
[01:40:37.860 --> 01:40:40.580]   Wi-Fi based calls, which AT&T supports,
[01:40:40.580 --> 01:40:43.620]   I don't think Verizon does, has doubled.
[01:40:43.620 --> 01:40:48.620]   Internet traffic up 20 to 25% from typical daily patterns
[01:40:48.620 --> 01:40:50.940]   according to AT&T Verizon.
[01:40:50.940 --> 01:40:54.020]   That means I guess internet traffic on your mobile device.
[01:40:54.020 --> 01:40:59.340]   So, you know, there we go, we're making more calls
[01:40:59.340 --> 01:41:01.740]   than we ever have in the past.
[01:41:01.740 --> 01:41:04.140]   - I think my favorite coronavirus story,
[01:41:04.140 --> 01:41:06.380]   like how the coronavirus has changed a story
[01:41:06.380 --> 01:41:09.180]   is from the Wall Street Journal talking about
[01:41:09.180 --> 01:41:11.860]   people injuring themselves doing home workouts.
[01:41:11.860 --> 01:41:14.060]   So, new home workouts come with new ex-paint.
[01:41:14.060 --> 01:41:15.620]   (laughing)
[01:41:15.620 --> 01:41:19.020]   And not because I mean, but because like,
[01:41:19.020 --> 01:41:21.060]   there's, it is a thing.
[01:41:21.060 --> 01:41:23.020]   People are like, oh my God, I could finally try this
[01:41:23.020 --> 01:41:25.020]   to have a blast. - I did a few too many
[01:41:25.020 --> 01:41:30.100]   sit-ups and I was in great agony for a whole evening.
[01:41:30.100 --> 01:41:33.420]   My stomach hurts so bad, oh man.
[01:41:33.420 --> 01:41:34.260]   - Yeah. - I wanted
[01:41:34.260 --> 01:41:36.980]   the coronavirus, it's like, "Kill me now."
[01:41:36.980 --> 01:41:39.940]   I'm serious, I don't know, I'm a wimp.
[01:41:39.940 --> 01:41:40.780]   I am a wimp.
[01:41:40.780 --> 01:41:42.660]   I am in pain when I get a headache and stuff.
[01:41:42.660 --> 01:41:44.820]   I just wanna die, I wanna crawl under a rock.
[01:41:44.820 --> 01:41:46.680]   I do not take pain well.
[01:41:46.680 --> 01:41:50.500]   That's which is why I can't ever get sick.
[01:41:50.500 --> 01:41:55.500]   All right, let's wrap this up with things.
[01:41:55.500 --> 01:42:00.380]   Jeff is gonna add to his numbers,
[01:42:00.380 --> 01:42:02.180]   he's gonna add a word of the week.
[01:42:02.180 --> 01:42:03.900]   I think that's a very-- - It's carstant like that.
[01:42:03.900 --> 01:42:05.940]   I don't know why I'd be-- - Oh, is it a German word?
[01:42:05.940 --> 01:42:08.580]   I love the German word of the week.
[01:42:08.580 --> 01:42:09.620]   - German word of the week.
[01:42:09.620 --> 01:42:12.020]   (laughing)
[01:42:12.020 --> 01:42:13.980]   - Carsten is the voice of God is worse.
[01:42:13.980 --> 01:42:16.740]   Much worse.
[01:42:16.740 --> 01:42:18.060]   - At least he's wearing a Twitch shirt.
[01:42:18.060 --> 01:42:19.980]   Is that why it took us so long to get you on camera?
[01:42:19.980 --> 01:42:21.420]   You had to put on a shirt?
[01:42:21.420 --> 01:42:25.220]   - No, I always wear my Twitch shirt.
[01:42:25.220 --> 01:42:26.580]   - Oh, okay, Carsten.
[01:42:26.580 --> 01:42:28.860]   - What, is Carsten like, is Carsten,
[01:42:28.860 --> 01:42:30.940]   are you in a law office?
[01:42:30.940 --> 01:42:32.060]   What are all the filing cabinets?
[01:42:32.060 --> 01:42:33.820]   - No, this is just my office.
[01:42:33.820 --> 01:42:35.220]   This is-- - He's here, I'll show you.
[01:42:35.220 --> 01:42:36.500]   - What do you have to file?
[01:42:36.500 --> 01:42:37.980]   What do you have to file?
[01:42:37.980 --> 01:42:39.460]   All those filing cabinets.
[01:42:39.460 --> 01:42:43.460]   I guarantee you, fill with project materials.
[01:42:43.460 --> 01:42:44.300]   He's a maker.
[01:42:44.300 --> 01:42:48.620]   - I just, I had to kick off my--
[01:42:48.620 --> 01:42:49.980]   (mumbling)
[01:42:49.980 --> 01:42:51.340]   This is my view.
[01:42:51.340 --> 01:42:52.460]   - Oh, wow, look at that.
[01:42:52.460 --> 01:42:54.060]   - Oh, shush, Carsten, oh, shush.
[01:42:54.060 --> 01:42:56.100]   - Oh, look at that, that's gorgeous.
[01:42:56.100 --> 01:42:56.940]   - Oh, man.
[01:42:56.940 --> 01:42:58.780]   - What do you have an oil rig out there?
[01:42:58.780 --> 01:43:01.540]   (laughing)
[01:43:01.540 --> 01:43:02.620]   - No, I know, I can't-- - I'm coming here.
[01:43:02.620 --> 01:43:06.140]   - We are the different stuff on the--
[01:43:06.140 --> 01:43:07.460]   - Is that the baby? - Yeah, this is, yeah,
[01:43:07.460 --> 01:43:10.660]   this is the fort that my dad and my kids and I built.
[01:43:10.660 --> 01:43:12.420]   - Oh, that's cool, that's really cool.
[01:43:12.420 --> 01:43:15.500]   - We just built a garden for my wife.
[01:43:15.500 --> 01:43:17.660]   - Look at this, what a nice house.
[01:43:17.660 --> 01:43:18.700]   You're out in the East Bay,
[01:43:18.700 --> 01:43:21.660]   is that Mount Diablo in the distance there?
[01:43:21.660 --> 01:43:23.500]   - That is Mount Tam.
[01:43:23.500 --> 01:43:25.020]   - Mount Tam, oh, that's us.
[01:43:25.020 --> 01:43:26.180]   - I'm Mount Tam.
[01:43:26.180 --> 01:43:28.060]   - Tam is up in Marin, but he can,
[01:43:28.060 --> 01:43:28.980]   but you don't let him Marin,
[01:43:28.980 --> 01:43:31.220]   you're looking across the bay.
[01:43:31.220 --> 01:43:33.980]   - Yeah, I look across the bay at Mount Tam.
[01:43:33.980 --> 01:43:34.820]   - Very nice.
[01:43:36.260 --> 01:43:37.100]   - Pretty nice.
[01:43:37.100 --> 01:43:41.940]   - Welcome to MTV Cribs, featuring Carsten Bondi.
[01:43:41.940 --> 01:43:44.140]   (laughing)
[01:43:44.140 --> 01:43:47.180]   That's a nice crib you got there, Carsten.
[01:43:47.180 --> 01:43:48.700]   - Yep.
[01:43:48.700 --> 01:43:51.780]   - Now it's time for Stacy's Pick of the Week.
[01:43:51.780 --> 01:43:53.740]   - I thought we were doing Jeff's word, okay.
[01:43:53.740 --> 01:43:57.180]   - Well, do you, then we do the word, then we do mine.
[01:43:57.180 --> 01:43:59.300]   - Okay, ladies first.
[01:43:59.300 --> 01:44:00.660]   - Ladies first.
[01:44:00.660 --> 01:44:03.420]   - This week, I am showing you the wise band--
[01:44:03.420 --> 01:44:04.700]   - Oh, you got it. - $85.
[01:44:04.700 --> 01:44:06.220]   - Oh, you got it. - You're good, hey.
[01:44:06.220 --> 01:44:07.980]   - I'm also-- - I have the two.
[01:44:07.980 --> 01:44:10.380]   - Beautiful screen.
[01:44:10.380 --> 01:44:11.620]   - Yep, can you see the screen?
[01:44:11.620 --> 01:44:13.460]   - Carsten has one too, see?
[01:44:13.460 --> 01:44:15.720]   (laughing)
[01:44:15.720 --> 01:44:19.260]   - So this is $24.99.
[01:44:19.260 --> 01:44:20.340]   I don't love the band.
[01:44:20.340 --> 01:44:23.140]   - The price is very good, but can you change the band out?
[01:44:23.140 --> 01:44:25.100]   Or do you have to use their band?
[01:44:25.100 --> 01:44:28.700]   - You have to use, oh, they have another strap.
[01:44:28.700 --> 01:44:29.900]   Is that what we're talking about?
[01:44:29.900 --> 01:44:31.420]   - Yeah, I know. - What is happening here?
[01:44:31.420 --> 01:44:33.140]   - I don't know, it's pretty fancy.
[01:44:33.140 --> 01:44:34.420]   - Wow.
[01:44:34.420 --> 01:44:36.700]   - Oh, Jeff is revolting.
[01:44:36.700 --> 01:44:39.500]   - Wow. - Jeff, he is revolting.
[01:44:39.500 --> 01:44:42.260]   - Apparently he found the bin where we keep
[01:44:42.260 --> 01:44:45.140]   in the shots we know he is.
[01:44:45.140 --> 01:44:47.380]   (laughing)
[01:44:47.380 --> 01:44:49.540]   Go ahead, go ahead.
[01:44:49.540 --> 01:44:51.540]   You have to completely lose control, Leo.
[01:44:51.540 --> 01:44:52.860]   Completely.
[01:44:52.860 --> 01:44:53.860]   - I didn't really want it.
[01:44:53.860 --> 01:44:56.820]   - I don't think this counts steps as accurately
[01:44:56.820 --> 01:44:58.540]   as my Fitbit, it's very different.
[01:44:58.540 --> 01:45:00.580]   It doesn't seem to do a great job
[01:45:00.580 --> 01:45:02.700]   tracking my heart rate during workouts.
[01:45:03.980 --> 01:45:05.860]   And it's a terrible sleep tracker.
[01:45:05.860 --> 01:45:07.780]   - Oh, this has like, it's worth everything.
[01:45:07.780 --> 01:45:09.020]   - Well, this sounds like great indoors,
[01:45:09.020 --> 01:45:11.100]   but it turns the lights off.
[01:45:11.100 --> 01:45:12.580]   - It does turn the lights off,
[01:45:12.580 --> 01:45:15.660]   but to do it with Madam A or the shortcut,
[01:45:15.660 --> 01:45:18.140]   your phone needs to be within Bluetooth range,
[01:45:18.140 --> 01:45:21.380]   which in my case, usually my phone is downstairs
[01:45:21.380 --> 01:45:22.740]   when I want to do any of this,
[01:45:22.740 --> 01:45:24.460]   which in all the upstairs,
[01:45:24.460 --> 01:45:26.180]   so it's kind of pointless for me
[01:45:26.180 --> 01:45:28.500]   'cause it needs to be able to communicate with your phone.
[01:45:28.500 --> 01:45:31.980]   So the band, I don't think it's that great,
[01:45:31.980 --> 01:45:34.420]   but it is cheap if that's your thing.
[01:45:34.420 --> 01:45:37.820]   Carsten does it, Carsten's like, ah, screw the band.
[01:45:37.820 --> 01:45:40.460]   - Carsten's assembled too much to drink today.
[01:45:40.460 --> 01:45:41.980]   I see the band. - I like the band.
[01:45:41.980 --> 01:45:43.260]   - I just went, do you like it?
[01:45:43.260 --> 01:45:44.100]   - Do you like it?
[01:45:44.100 --> 01:45:45.980]   - Yeah, do you like it?
[01:45:45.980 --> 01:45:48.940]   - It's 'cause it's 24 bucks.
[01:45:48.940 --> 01:45:50.220]   - Okay, it's not a cool one.
[01:45:50.220 --> 01:45:52.260]   - It's super cheap.
[01:45:52.260 --> 01:45:55.300]   I don't know, I guess I've only had it for a day,
[01:45:55.300 --> 01:45:59.980]   so I don't know about its accuracy at anything,
[01:45:59.980 --> 01:46:03.500]   but it's nice to be able to have a little thing
[01:46:03.500 --> 01:46:06.860]   that I can shout out to turn off my lights.
[01:46:06.860 --> 01:46:09.380]   - It's interesting, maybe WISE doesn't like the band either
[01:46:09.380 --> 01:46:10.540]   'cause if you go to the website,
[01:46:10.540 --> 01:46:12.420]   it is not on the front page of their website.
[01:46:12.420 --> 01:46:14.660]   You have to go into the store to find it,
[01:46:14.660 --> 01:46:18.620]   but they have added a no touch thermometer for 54 bucks.
[01:46:18.620 --> 01:46:20.820]   - Yes, they did that as part of their COVID response.
[01:46:20.820 --> 01:46:21.740]   - That's great.
[01:46:21.740 --> 01:46:23.820]   And that, by the way, I think having a note,
[01:46:23.820 --> 01:46:26.380]   everybody should have a no touch thermometer,
[01:46:26.380 --> 01:46:29.060]   not just for now, but forever.
[01:46:29.060 --> 01:46:29.900]   - No touch.
[01:46:29.900 --> 01:46:31.500]   - What's the competitor of the WISE band?
[01:46:31.500 --> 01:46:32.580]   - It's in for it a few thermometers.
[01:46:32.580 --> 01:46:33.740]   - But not for the forehand.
[01:46:33.740 --> 01:46:34.580]   - Oh, okay.
[01:46:34.580 --> 01:46:36.180]   - Oh, the Fitbit is much better.
[01:46:36.180 --> 01:46:38.220]   - The Fitbit, yeah, so that's what I've got on.
[01:46:38.220 --> 01:46:39.940]   The Fitbit 3, in charge.
[01:46:39.940 --> 01:46:40.780]   - Do you have a charge?
[01:46:40.780 --> 01:46:41.620]   - Yeah.
[01:46:41.620 --> 01:46:43.180]   - Yeah, the Charge 4 just came out.
[01:46:43.180 --> 01:46:44.020]   - Yeah.
[01:46:44.020 --> 01:46:45.660]   - Okay, but here's the other product.
[01:46:45.660 --> 01:46:46.500]   Ta-da!
[01:46:46.500 --> 01:46:47.580]   - Oh, you got the scale.
[01:46:47.580 --> 01:46:50.500]   - This is the WISE scale for 1999,
[01:46:50.500 --> 01:46:51.420]   and I recommend--
[01:46:51.420 --> 01:46:53.660]   - Exactly like the Y-things scale.
[01:46:53.660 --> 01:46:54.500]   - Doesn't it?
[01:46:54.500 --> 01:46:55.340]   - Yeah.
[01:46:55.340 --> 01:46:58.180]   - I wonder if they got it from the same place,
[01:46:58.180 --> 01:47:01.620]   although there's a lot cheaper, like, 20 bucks, wow.
[01:47:01.620 --> 01:47:06.100]   - 1999 for this thing, plus, I think, 899 shipping.
[01:47:06.100 --> 01:47:07.780]   I'm gonna recommend that if you were in the market
[01:47:07.780 --> 01:47:09.740]   for a digital scale, but you were like,
[01:47:09.740 --> 01:47:11.540]   I'm not paying $100 or $100 in the company.
[01:47:11.540 --> 01:47:12.380]   - Oh, this is good.
[01:47:12.380 --> 01:47:14.540]   For that price, this is what you gotta get.
[01:47:14.540 --> 01:47:15.780]   - It seems to be accurate.
[01:47:15.780 --> 01:47:20.780]   WISE says that is accurate plus or minus 0.5 pounds.
[01:47:20.780 --> 01:47:21.620]   - I believe so.
[01:47:21.620 --> 01:47:23.780]   - It seems to be accurate with my weight.
[01:47:23.780 --> 01:47:28.780]   And it also, on all of their metrics that they have,
[01:47:28.780 --> 01:47:33.780]   they use impedance to detect body, sorry.
[01:47:33.780 --> 01:47:37.140]   - Body fat, body composition, yeah.
[01:47:37.140 --> 01:47:40.940]   - Body composition, visceral fat, my favorite.
[01:47:40.940 --> 01:47:45.580]   Let's see, protein, skeletal mass,
[01:47:45.580 --> 01:47:48.420]   that you'll give you your basal metabolic rate
[01:47:48.420 --> 01:47:50.060]   based on your age and height and weight.
[01:47:50.060 --> 01:47:53.100]   - And this Bluetooth enabled, what app does it hook up to?
[01:47:53.100 --> 01:47:55.260]   - Wise, so you've gotta open your WISE app
[01:47:55.260 --> 01:47:57.620]   and it'll pull all this data in.
[01:47:57.620 --> 01:48:01.620]   I found it terrifying to step on the scale.
[01:48:01.620 --> 01:48:06.380]   Now that I've stepped on the scale, I wish I hadn't.
[01:48:06.380 --> 01:48:08.260]   'Cause now I'm gonna have to do something about the fact
[01:48:08.260 --> 01:48:11.620]   that this weekend was my birthday, I ate half a cake in.
[01:48:11.620 --> 01:48:12.460]   - Okay.
[01:48:12.460 --> 01:48:14.300]   - Oh, okay.
[01:48:14.300 --> 01:48:18.020]   - Oh, I forgot, yeah, happy birthday, happy birthday.
[01:48:18.020 --> 01:48:21.020]   - Thank you, it was, I mean, it was last, it was Saturday.
[01:48:21.020 --> 01:48:23.820]   - It was a bit drooling a little bit, I mean.
[01:48:23.820 --> 01:48:27.180]   - Is that because of the cake?
[01:48:27.180 --> 01:48:28.460]   'Cause it was delicious.
[01:48:28.460 --> 01:48:32.820]   Anyway, so, the wide scale, go for it.
[01:48:32.820 --> 01:48:34.820]   Downside to both of these devices,
[01:48:34.820 --> 01:48:37.340]   the scale and the band do not integrate yet,
[01:48:37.340 --> 01:48:40.820]   but they will integrate with HealthKit, Google Fit,
[01:48:40.820 --> 01:48:44.220]   Samsung Fit or whatever Samsung sex exercise thing is,
[01:48:44.220 --> 01:48:48.420]   and FitFit, but not yet.
[01:48:48.420 --> 01:48:50.180]   - But not Apple.
[01:48:50.180 --> 01:48:51.300]   - No, HealthKit is in there.
[01:48:51.300 --> 01:48:52.620]   - Oh, HealthKit. - Apple, HealthKit.
[01:48:52.620 --> 01:48:54.060]   - When you say HealthKit, that's of course, Apple.
[01:48:54.060 --> 01:48:55.060]   Yes, I should have known.
[01:48:55.060 --> 01:48:57.260]   - When I say HealthKit, I mean Apple.
[01:48:57.260 --> 01:48:58.100]   - HealthKit.
[01:48:58.100 --> 01:49:00.140]   - Unfortunately, it is not in stock,
[01:49:00.140 --> 01:49:03.060]   it's, they had early access, which I guess you took advantage of,
[01:49:03.060 --> 01:49:05.860]   but get in line, you could probably get it
[01:49:05.860 --> 01:49:06.940]   sometime down the road.
[01:49:06.940 --> 01:49:08.900]   That's a great price, they'll sell a lot of those,
[01:49:08.900 --> 01:49:10.060]   I think that's a very,
[01:49:10.060 --> 01:49:10.900]   - Oh yeah.
[01:49:10.900 --> 01:49:12.460]   - Oh, happy birthday, Scooter X.
[01:49:12.460 --> 01:49:13.300]   We're birthday buddy.
[01:49:13.300 --> 01:49:18.140]   - Scooter X also, happy birthday, he's our chat mod.
[01:49:18.140 --> 01:49:21.020]   - Jeff, number word, what do you got?
[01:49:21.020 --> 01:49:24.100]   - Oh, well, no, a quick number is that Google and Facebook
[01:49:24.100 --> 01:49:27.020]   may have their first time ever declines in ad revenue
[01:49:27.020 --> 01:49:27.940]   thanks to the crisis.
[01:49:27.940 --> 01:49:30.060]   - How will you answer what the market says?
[01:49:30.060 --> 01:49:30.900]   - Yeah.
[01:49:30.900 --> 01:49:32.540]   - And my word, my German word machine,
[01:49:32.540 --> 01:49:33.540]   - That's bad.
[01:49:33.540 --> 01:49:34.380]   - Every week we find one.
[01:49:34.380 --> 01:49:37.780]   - That's bad mojo, I apologize, I'm sorry Google
[01:49:37.780 --> 01:49:39.140]   and Facebook, I'm sorry.
[01:49:39.140 --> 01:49:41.260]   - What's your,
[01:49:41.260 --> 01:49:42.100]   - Mund Schutz.
[01:49:42.100 --> 01:49:42.940]   - Mund Schutz.
[01:49:42.940 --> 01:49:45.420]   - But let me think what that means.
[01:49:45.420 --> 01:49:47.700]   Mund, Mund would be the world.
[01:49:47.700 --> 01:49:49.220]   - The world is full of Schutz.
[01:49:49.220 --> 01:49:50.300]   - The world is full of Schutz.
[01:49:50.300 --> 01:49:51.820]   - The world is full of Schutz.
[01:49:51.820 --> 01:49:53.540]   - The world is full of Schutz.
[01:49:53.540 --> 01:49:56.460]   No, I know Schutz is not the German word for Schutz.
[01:49:56.460 --> 01:50:01.460]   Schutz, I think Schutz is a slide.
[01:50:01.460 --> 01:50:04.700]   So Mund Schutz is the world is going downhill.
[01:50:04.700 --> 01:50:06.700]   - Mund is mouth.
[01:50:06.700 --> 01:50:07.700]   - Mouth.
[01:50:07.700 --> 01:50:10.540]   - So I have to give you an idea what's the word right now?
[01:50:10.540 --> 01:50:11.540]   - So it's my word right now.
[01:50:11.540 --> 01:50:12.540]   - So it's my word right now?
[01:50:12.540 --> 01:50:15.700]   - Oh, it's my mouth spit.
[01:50:15.700 --> 01:50:17.700]   - No, it's mouth protection.
[01:50:17.700 --> 01:50:19.700]   - Oh, mask.
[01:50:19.700 --> 01:50:20.700]   - Mask.
[01:50:20.700 --> 01:50:21.700]   - Mask.
[01:50:21.700 --> 01:50:22.700]   - It's a mask.
[01:50:22.700 --> 01:50:23.700]   - It's a mask.
[01:50:23.700 --> 01:50:24.700]   - It's a mask.
[01:50:24.700 --> 01:50:25.700]   - It's a mask.
[01:50:25.700 --> 01:50:26.700]   - Okay, sure.
[01:50:26.700 --> 01:50:28.700]   - And so they have, there's the site which I pointed to,
[01:50:28.700 --> 01:50:31.700]   has a large feature about how to Mund Schutz.
[01:50:31.700 --> 01:50:33.700]   Which I link to there.
[01:50:33.700 --> 01:50:37.700]   - So, but the Dan lines uses the word mask.
[01:50:37.700 --> 01:50:39.700]   So is mask more.
[01:50:39.700 --> 01:50:40.700]   - That's the same.
[01:50:40.700 --> 01:50:42.700]   - But I, well the front of the home page is how to Mund Schutz.
[01:50:42.700 --> 01:50:44.700]   So I thought, oh, Carson word.
[01:50:44.700 --> 01:50:46.700]   - That's a, I like Mund Schutz.
[01:50:46.700 --> 01:50:48.700]   - I'm gonna make some Mund Schutz.
[01:50:48.700 --> 01:50:49.700]   - Yeah.
[01:50:49.700 --> 01:50:50.700]   - Yeah.
[01:50:50.700 --> 01:50:52.700]   - I'm gonna make a whiskey sour.
[01:50:52.700 --> 01:50:54.700]   (laughing)
[01:50:54.700 --> 01:50:56.700]   - And then, so that was the word and number.
[01:50:56.700 --> 01:50:59.700]   And I have a, do you remember the million dollar home page?
[01:50:59.700 --> 01:51:00.700]   - Yeah.
[01:51:00.700 --> 01:51:03.700]   - Yeah, you brought those memories back with this one.
[01:51:03.700 --> 01:51:06.700]   - Yeah, so the million dollar home page you'd buy a pixel or two
[01:51:06.700 --> 01:51:07.700]   or three or 10 or a hundred.
[01:51:07.700 --> 01:51:11.700]   And the guy rate, the guy made a lot of money, made a million bucks.
[01:51:11.700 --> 01:51:14.700]   So this is the million dollar metropolis.
[01:51:14.700 --> 01:51:18.700]   His goal is to sell advertising in all of these buildings.
[01:51:18.700 --> 01:51:21.700]   There are 500 buildings, buildings.
[01:51:21.700 --> 01:51:23.700]   He says, own a piece of internet history.
[01:51:23.700 --> 01:51:25.700]   It's a little, I have to say it's a little more,
[01:51:25.700 --> 01:51:29.700]   if you see he has a lot of room for ad sales.
[01:51:29.700 --> 01:51:32.700]   But I have to say it's a little more interesting,
[01:51:32.700 --> 01:51:36.700]   besides being 3D than the million dollar home page.
[01:51:36.700 --> 01:51:40.700]   You can click on one of these ads and it'll take you to the website.
[01:51:40.700 --> 01:51:42.700]   Well, I guess the million dollar home page.
[01:51:42.700 --> 01:51:43.700]   - Whoop-dee-doo.
[01:51:43.700 --> 01:51:44.700]   - Whoop-dee-doo.
[01:51:44.700 --> 01:51:45.700]   - Whoop-dee-doo.
[01:51:45.700 --> 01:51:49.700]   - Add spots available so you can see the tower, you know,
[01:51:49.700 --> 01:51:51.700]   by clicking on it and see what--
[01:51:51.700 --> 01:51:52.700]   - 20 years late, fella.
[01:51:52.700 --> 01:51:53.700]   (laughs)
[01:51:53.700 --> 01:51:56.700]   - So I know million dollar home page, he sold out.
[01:51:56.700 --> 01:51:58.700]   I wonder if it's still around, actually.
[01:51:58.700 --> 01:52:05.700]   - I looked it up on Wikipedia and 40% of the ads are now phantom.
[01:52:05.700 --> 01:52:06.700]   - There it is.
[01:52:06.700 --> 01:52:07.700]   - The clicks don't work.
[01:52:07.700 --> 01:52:08.700]   - Boy.
[01:52:08.700 --> 01:52:09.700]   - Here it is.
[01:52:09.700 --> 01:52:11.700]   - A one point, $1,000,000, $1,000,000.
[01:52:11.700 --> 01:52:12.700]   - A $1,000,000, $1,000,000.
[01:52:12.700 --> 01:52:14.700]   - And it had the same slogan, "Show this, Jeff.
[01:52:14.700 --> 01:52:17.700]   This is the million dollar home page, the original."
[01:52:17.700 --> 01:52:21.700]   Not nearly as clever, but he did sell a million,
[01:52:21.700 --> 01:52:23.700]   there were a million pixels, he sold all of this.
[01:52:23.700 --> 01:52:24.700]   - What year was this?
[01:52:24.700 --> 01:52:26.700]   - Gosh, a long time ago.
[01:52:26.700 --> 01:52:29.700]   - Not 2009, it's been, no, it launched in 2005.
[01:52:29.700 --> 01:52:32.700]   - So there's a lot of this stuff is long gone, right?
[01:52:32.700 --> 01:52:33.700]   - Yeah.
[01:52:33.700 --> 01:52:37.700]   - Cuzzle, guzzle, all the beer, wine, cheese, and other delicacies
[01:52:37.700 --> 01:52:38.700]   you can guzzle.
[01:52:38.700 --> 01:52:42.700]   Chip and Dale's the premier brand in ladies entertainment.
[01:52:42.700 --> 01:52:43.700]   - Women, dicks.
[01:52:43.700 --> 01:52:47.700]   - Advice in FAQs on dry skin conditions.
[01:52:47.700 --> 01:52:50.700]   - There's the times of London above that.
[01:52:50.700 --> 01:52:54.700]   - Yeah, look at that, the times of London, and it actually takes you,
[01:52:54.700 --> 01:52:58.700]   look at that, to the times of London, isn't that amazing?
[01:52:58.700 --> 01:53:00.700]   They bought a lot, how many pixels is that?
[01:53:00.700 --> 01:53:01.700]   That's a big one.
[01:53:01.700 --> 01:53:04.700]   So didn't this guy like put himself through school or graduate school
[01:53:04.700 --> 01:53:06.700]   or something like that with this?
[01:53:06.700 --> 01:53:07.700]   I feel like it was--
[01:53:07.700 --> 01:53:11.700]   - He auctioned off the last thousand pixels on eBay.
[01:53:11.700 --> 01:53:16.700]   So the total was $1,000,000, $1,100,000 gross.
[01:53:16.700 --> 01:53:19.700]   - Everything that it connects to is gone now, but the--
[01:53:19.700 --> 01:53:20.700]   - 40%.
[01:53:20.700 --> 01:53:22.700]   - But the million dollar home page lives on.
[01:53:22.700 --> 01:53:27.700]   I guess he's got to keep paying for this for a while.
[01:53:27.700 --> 01:53:30.700]   Here's the Xbox 360 store.
[01:53:30.700 --> 01:53:31.700]   That dates it.
[01:53:31.700 --> 01:53:35.700]   - We just got an Xbox.
[01:53:35.700 --> 01:53:37.700]   IP chicken, wow, look at that.
[01:53:37.700 --> 01:53:39.700]   I remember those guys.
[01:53:39.700 --> 01:53:42.700]   Congratulations, what game are you playing?
[01:53:42.700 --> 01:53:44.700]   - I'm not playing.
[01:53:44.700 --> 01:53:45.700]   - Ling is on here.
[01:53:45.700 --> 01:53:50.700]   This is my very favorite page of all time.
[01:53:50.700 --> 01:53:51.700]   - Oh, God.
[01:53:51.700 --> 01:53:53.700]   - Ling's used cars.
[01:53:53.700 --> 01:53:54.700]   - Oh, shit.
[01:53:54.700 --> 01:53:57.700]   (laughing)
[01:53:57.700 --> 01:53:59.700]   - Now with more COVID.
[01:53:59.700 --> 01:54:01.700]   Now with Munchuts.
[01:54:01.700 --> 01:54:06.700]   (laughing)
[01:54:06.700 --> 01:54:07.700]   - Wow.
[01:54:07.700 --> 01:54:12.700]   - The busiest web page of all times, also probably from 2005.
[01:54:12.700 --> 01:54:15.700]   - It's kind of the evil craigslist.
[01:54:15.700 --> 01:54:16.700]   - It's never changed.
[01:54:16.700 --> 01:54:18.700]   - It's never changed.
[01:54:18.700 --> 01:54:21.700]   It's never changed.
[01:54:21.700 --> 01:54:23.700]   In fact, I think we interviewed Ling.
[01:54:23.700 --> 01:54:24.700]   Didn't we?
[01:54:24.700 --> 01:54:28.700]   - I should totally show my daughter this so she can understand how much the web has improved.
[01:54:28.700 --> 01:54:29.700]   (laughing)
[01:54:29.700 --> 01:54:35.700]   - I remember interviewing Ling and she was wearing, I seem to remember an orange life vest.
[01:54:35.700 --> 01:54:36.700]   (laughing)
[01:54:36.700 --> 01:54:39.700]   And a helmet for no apparent reason.
[01:54:39.700 --> 01:54:42.700]   Ladies and gentlemen, Carson's passed out.
[01:54:42.700 --> 01:54:45.700]   I think it's time to say goodbye to all the family.
[01:54:45.700 --> 01:54:46.700]   No, I guess not.
[01:54:46.700 --> 01:54:48.700]   - I'm still here.
[01:54:48.700 --> 01:54:50.700]   I'm still here.
[01:54:50.700 --> 01:54:52.700]   - You can't get rid of me.
[01:54:52.700 --> 01:54:53.700]   - You can't get rid of me.
[01:54:53.700 --> 01:54:56.700]   - You said his name three times and he appeared.
[01:54:56.700 --> 01:54:58.700]   (laughing)
[01:54:58.700 --> 01:55:00.700]   - Thank you, Carson.
[01:55:00.700 --> 01:55:05.700]   Carson Bonny, our producer, producing from home as he has been during this crisis.
[01:55:05.700 --> 01:55:10.700]   As all our producers do, and thank you all of you for staying in the loop, working hard,
[01:55:10.700 --> 01:55:12.700]   even though you don't have to.
[01:55:12.700 --> 01:55:13.700]   - We're waving to Carson.
[01:55:13.700 --> 01:55:15.700]   - We're waving to Carson here.
[01:55:15.700 --> 01:55:16.700]   I'll wave back.
[01:55:16.700 --> 01:55:18.700]   - Carson's gonna wave back now.
[01:55:18.700 --> 01:55:20.700]   (laughing)
[01:55:20.700 --> 01:55:26.700]   - Stacey Egan-Botham is the queen of IOT, Stacey on IOT.com.
[01:55:26.700 --> 01:55:31.700]   That's where you can subscribe to our free newsletter and don't forget the IOT podcast she does with Kevin Tofel.
[01:55:31.700 --> 01:55:34.700]   Also linked there at Kika Stacey on the Twitter.
[01:55:34.700 --> 01:55:35.700]   Thank you, Stacey.
[01:55:35.700 --> 01:55:37.700]   Be well.
[01:55:37.700 --> 01:55:38.700]   Stay safe.
[01:55:38.700 --> 01:55:40.700]   We'll see you next week.
[01:55:40.700 --> 01:55:41.700]   - Build it.
[01:55:41.700 --> 01:55:46.700]   - And Stacey sent me an email in which she said, "Ooh, ooh."
[01:55:46.700 --> 01:55:47.700]   And I could just hear your voice.
[01:55:47.700 --> 01:55:50.700]   "Ooh, you can make sourdough bread in the thermo mix."
[01:55:50.700 --> 01:55:51.700]   - Ooh.
[01:55:51.700 --> 01:55:52.700]   - Did you try it?
[01:55:52.700 --> 01:55:55.700]   - No, because when I looked at the recipe,
[01:55:55.700 --> 01:56:00.700]   the thermo mix did this much and you still had to do all the other stuff.
[01:56:00.700 --> 01:56:04.700]   So it really didn't, if it baked it in the thermo mix, then I'd be interested.
[01:56:04.700 --> 01:56:08.700]   But no, you still had to bake it in the oven to the auto lease and all that stuff.
[01:56:08.700 --> 01:56:10.700]   And I do that already with my KitchenAid.
[01:56:10.700 --> 01:56:14.700]   It's a little old fashioned, but it does the job.
[01:56:14.700 --> 01:56:16.700]   I have a dough hook and all that.
[01:56:16.700 --> 01:56:18.700]   So I'm kind of done with sourdough.
[01:56:18.700 --> 01:56:21.700]   I'm one of the sourdough enough for the sourdough guys.
[01:56:21.700 --> 01:56:22.700]   - You're sourdough sourdough.
[01:56:22.700 --> 01:56:24.700]   - I'm sourdough sourdough.
[01:56:24.700 --> 01:56:31.700]   - Jeff Jarvis, he's a professor at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at
[01:56:31.700 --> 01:56:33.700]   the City University of New York.
[01:56:33.700 --> 01:56:37.700]   He's the director of the Townite Center of Entrepreneurial Journalism.
[01:56:37.700 --> 01:56:39.700]   CUNY.
[01:56:39.700 --> 01:56:41.700]   CUNY.
[01:56:41.700 --> 01:56:43.700]   And our kids going to graduate.
[01:56:43.700 --> 01:56:45.700]   What are you going to do for graduation?
[01:56:45.700 --> 01:56:46.700]   - Oh, yeah.
[01:56:46.700 --> 01:56:47.700]   I did class.
[01:56:47.700 --> 01:56:50.700]   I just wrote a post about how I did my class online.
[01:56:50.700 --> 01:56:55.700]   I've been seeing all these post-seniors, pictures of seniors.
[01:56:55.700 --> 01:56:57.700]   Is that related to the fact that I'm not--
[01:56:57.700 --> 01:57:00.700]   - It's somehow giving tribute to the seniors.
[01:57:00.700 --> 01:57:02.700]   - I don't get to walk.
[01:57:02.700 --> 01:57:03.700]   - I mean, it is.
[01:57:03.700 --> 01:57:07.700]   If I were a senior, less so college, but high school is-- I feel bad for us.
[01:57:07.700 --> 01:57:11.700]   - I know some people are very upset about not being able to graduate.
[01:57:11.700 --> 01:57:14.700]   They're not going to graduate, but they're not going to be able to walk.
[01:57:14.700 --> 01:57:15.700]   - They're not going to be able to go to prom.
[01:57:15.700 --> 01:57:19.700]   They're not going to be able to do, like, I mean, well, some of them did spring break trips,
[01:57:19.700 --> 01:57:21.700]   but it's a big deal.
[01:57:21.700 --> 01:57:24.700]   - Just remember, you're doing it for your elders.
[01:57:24.700 --> 01:57:26.700]   People like me and Jeff.
[01:57:26.700 --> 01:57:29.700]   My mother was still-- to her dying day was mad at me.
[01:57:29.700 --> 01:57:31.700]   I didn't go to my college graduation.
[01:57:31.700 --> 01:57:33.700]   - I walked out of my college graduation.
[01:57:33.700 --> 01:57:34.700]   - We don't?
[01:57:34.700 --> 01:57:35.700]   - You walked out of it?
[01:57:35.700 --> 01:57:37.700]   - Yeah, it was so long and boring.
[01:57:37.700 --> 01:57:40.700]   And I was mad because I was in an honors society.
[01:57:40.700 --> 01:57:41.700]   - It didn't meet Stacy's standards.
[01:57:41.700 --> 01:57:43.700]   - And you didn't get a mention?
[01:57:43.700 --> 01:57:46.700]   - They didn't mention my honors status.
[01:57:46.700 --> 01:57:48.700]   I was like, pfft.
[01:57:48.700 --> 01:57:50.700]   So I like ducked out right after the walk.
[01:57:50.700 --> 01:57:53.700]   My parents, I showed up behind them and they're like, what?
[01:57:53.700 --> 01:57:54.700]   How did you do that?
[01:57:54.700 --> 01:57:55.700]   What are you doing?
[01:57:55.700 --> 01:57:57.700]   Let's go eat.
[01:57:57.700 --> 01:57:59.700]   - Oh, that's cute.
[01:57:59.700 --> 01:58:00.700]   I just-- - Are we done?
[01:58:00.700 --> 01:58:01.700]   - Not yet.
[01:58:01.700 --> 01:58:02.700]   Sorry.
[01:58:02.700 --> 01:58:03.700]   - Yeah, we're done.
[01:58:03.700 --> 01:58:04.700]   - Oh, okay.
[01:58:04.700 --> 01:58:05.700]   I gotta go.
[01:58:05.700 --> 01:58:06.700]   - Thank you, everybody.
[01:58:06.700 --> 01:58:07.700]   Thank you for being here.
[01:58:07.700 --> 01:58:08.700]   We do this week in Google.
