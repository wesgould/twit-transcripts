[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   Coming up on this week in Google, Kevin Marks joins me, Jeff and Gina,
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.200]   because Lea is out at NAB.
[00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.400]   We're going to talk all about the Oracle Google court case,
[00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.300]   what the wider implications of that are.
[00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:11.700]   It's going to lead to a patent discussion.
[00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.000]   We're going to talk about Twitter's IPA.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   Is it as good as the kind you drink?
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   And Tim Berners-Lee has hope for the Internet.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   All that more coming up.
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   Netcast you love.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   From people you trust.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   This is Twig.

[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   This week in Google, I'm Tom Merritt filling in for Leo Laporte
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   who's at NAB, the National Association of Broadcasters.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   But we have your familiar panelists to make you feel reassured
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   that everything will be just as good as usual joining us this week.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   As always, Gina Trapani from SmarterWear.org.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   Welcome, Gina.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   Howdy.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   I just upgraded my SmarterWear to 1.04.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   My ThinkUp.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   Oh, yay! ThinkUp! ThinkUp Upgrade!
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   Yeah, my ThinkUp.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   Well, ThinkUp is one of the SmarterWear's.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   One of the SmarterWear's.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   One of the SmarterWear's.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   One of the SmarterWear's.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   I'm not sure if you can tell anybody else, Tom, but you're one of our favorite users.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   No, thank you.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   Perhaps our favorite.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   Let's stop.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   Just you.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   We could go on forever, but we have to introduce Jeff Jarvis, too,
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   of BuzzMachine.com, author of Public Parts.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   I'm kind of here.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   You are definitely here on our end.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   I know we're fuzzy to you a little bit, but I'm screaming
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   about University of the IT department.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   If you're screaming in the background, it's probably the IT department
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   visiting Jeff.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   And our guest on the panel this week, Kevin Marks,
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   TomMovision.tv,
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   always braving a new frontier to bring us his video.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   You're in a conference room or a conference hallway.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   I'm a conference hallway.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   My neighbor was wood chipping an oak tree, so I came over to demo
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   and sat in the hallway.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   That always makes me think of the movie of sat in the park.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   It always makes me think of the movie Fargo when I hear a wood chipper.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   (laughter)
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   Don't look too closely at what he's doing in there.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   (laughter)
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   All right, well, let's get on with the show.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   Starting with the Gmail downtime yesterday.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   Got everybody all panicked.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   Google at first said they were investigating, then they fixed it.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   It was only down for less than two hours.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   They said it affected less than two percent of users,
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   then they revised that upset and maybe it affected less than ten
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   percent of users.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   And they said it's possible that some users may still experience
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   delays with the delivery of certain messages while the account
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   access is restored.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   I never ran into it.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   I use Gmail for all my email practically.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   Did anybody else?
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   I did, yeah.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   I saw the outage.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   I just sent a couple of pictures from my phone and I was waiting
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   for the, you know, that sent sound and I didn't hear it.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   And then I went in Chrome and got the, you know, error number 739
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   retrying again and it counts down in seconds.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   You know, even if it was just ten percent of users, that's a lot
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   of users.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   That's a lot of people.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   And I was sort of amused by the panic on Twitter.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   Like, where's, you know, where's like Gmail is like breathing?
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   It's like you can't get through a work day, you know, without
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   having Gmail for a while.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   But it came back for me within like 20 minutes, maybe maybe
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   30 minutes.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   It wasn't a big deal.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   Either I wasn't affected or I just never checked email.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   Jeff, were you lucky enough to dodge it?
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   I didn't notice it at all.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   What about you, Kevin?
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   I didn't notice it, but I was on my phone and traveling a lot
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   yesterday.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   So you weren't really in the best test case for it.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   I had problems with Google Docs in the afternoon, but that
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   doesn't think that has anything to do with this.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   And who knows what it had to do with it.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   It's always weird the way Google Docs works with Chrome.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   And I've got a solution to one of my problems that I had with
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   Chrome and Google Docs.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   So we'll talk about it in the tools at the very end of the
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   show.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   How's that for a teaser head?
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   All the way.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   Don't stop listening.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   Don't stop watching.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   But let's talk about the World Series of Intellectual
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   Property Trials going on.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   It's actually what Judge William Alsop, who's presiding over the
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   case in San Francisco District Court, called the Oracle Google
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   Trial.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   And it's the trial of two Larry's as well.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   Larry Page and Larry Ellison both taking the stand.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   Larry Ellison took the stand in person first.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   Larry Page had his deposition played.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   Then Larry Ellison took the stage.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   Or took the stage.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   Took the stand.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   It is kind of like a stage.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   It's like a mini tech conference, isn't it?
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   It's both of the PowerPoint.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   It sort of is, right?
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   Larry Page and his deposition was asked about some particularly
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   damning emails involving Andy Rubin.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   They tried to get him to admit that Andy Rubin ran a presentation
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   called "Must Take License from Sun" page that he couldn't confirm
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   that.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   He didn't know if that was true or not.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   Larry Ellison followed on the witness stand yesterday afternoon,
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   was asked whether or not it is expensive to develop APIs.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   He sort of sighed dramatically, said arguably it's one of the
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   most difficult things we do at Oracle.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   Then he discussed the licensing.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   He stated Google was the only company he knew who didn't take
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   a license, even a GPL license for the APIs.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   What Oracle is trying to do here is say that Google is using the
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   APIs, 37 APIs, without permission from Oracle and therefore
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   they're violating copyright that Oracle has over there.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   Even though the rest of Java is open source, Larry Page then took
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   the stand after Larry Ellison and he continued this morning and
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   basically said, "Look, if there were no APIs, we would only have a
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   language.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   You would be able to write basic computations that never did
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   any input or output, had any communication with the outside
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   world or the underlying platform.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   It would be like trying to call Jeff Jarvis.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   You just get that so.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   The person you're trying to reach is not available.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   You don't have an API.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   It was so elegant.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   Jeff dropped off.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   We're trying to get him back.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   But that's what this all boils down to is Oracle is trying to
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   say that Google ripped off the APIs from them to make Java work
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   on Android because they didn't use the official Java machine.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   They made their own with Dalvik and therefore they owe Oracle
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   money.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   Google is trying to say, "No, this is an open source operating
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   system."
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   The APIs are included with that because no -- no, not open source
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   operating system, but open source programming language because
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   no programming language is worth anything without APIs.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   Gina, where do you fall on this?
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   It's going to be up to the court to rule.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   It is.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   I mean, this whole case seems quite a bit of theater.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   It seems like these two companies probably could have worked
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   this out or settled sooner.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   I'm surprised that they didn't.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   But at the same time, I'm kind of enjoying this conversation.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   How is this going to turn out in the end?
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   I mean, to tell you the truth, I kind of take Google side here.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   And I think you said on TNT yesterday, the metaphor you used is
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   saying, "Here's a language.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   Here are all the letters, but you can't use the nouns."
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   I mean, the core APIs that they're talking about from what I
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   understand, creepy from wrong, are like core Java objects,
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   like object and like number.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   It's really kind of basic.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   And 37 objects, I think, in 15 million lines of Android codes,
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   it's a very small part of Android code.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   And I'm a Java programmer.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   Java's, my first was really my first language.
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   And I would consider those APIs part of the language.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   I mean, Java doesn't do anything without them.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   So I tend toward thinking that Google's assumption that this
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   was just part of the language seems reasonable to me.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   At the same time, other companies, according to Amazon,
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   no other company, didn't take the license.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   And these companies should have been talking.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   It sounded like they were.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   There's a lot of back padding when Android decided to use Java.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   But now it sounds like Oracle just trying to get some money
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   that they shouldn't have.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   And we're getting this kind of fun trial, fun to hear about
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   and watch.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   I really liked Google Slides, which I think was posted maybe
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   on the verge of her just doing really great coverage of this trial.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   But I'm kind of Google on this one, Tom.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   Yeah, well, Google Slides, Key Points of Evidence,
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   Sun gave Java language to the public, which is true, but they
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   didn't necessarily give the mobile implementation of it to the
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   public.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   Google built Android using free and open technologies.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   Sun publicly approved of Android's use of Java.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   And they make use of quotes from CEO Jonathan Swartz praising
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   Android after it was released in the utilization of Java.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   And Google made fair use of the Java language APIs in Android,
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   which is their big argument is that we're not violating
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   copyright law, that APIs have to be used to make a programming
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   language.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   Programming language isn't copyrightable, therefore it's fair
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   use.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   What do you think?
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   Do you agree with Gina that Google's probably got the better
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   argument?
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   I think it's true.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   I think they definitely have got the better argument.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   And it's notable that they're backed away from the whole patent
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   thing that was wrapped around in this to begin with.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   And it's now they're now trying to argue copyright, which is a
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   much weaker thing to argue.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   You can defend copyright on many other grounds for infringement.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   You can argue that it's fair use and so on.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   So I think that this is -- I'm not quite sure why they're
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   persisting with this.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   All they're likely to do is make people aware of using their
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   technologies in the future because people may do this.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   Oracle owns another big chunk of open source technology or owns
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   the company that built it, which is MySQL.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   And there's definitely some nervousness there that people
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   will say, wait a minute, if they're doing this with Java
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   as MySQL next, they're going to use Oracle databases instead of
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   running MySQL.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   So there is -- I'm not quite sure what Oracle's game plan is
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   and what they're trying to gain from this.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   Well, Judge William Alsup agrees with you.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   I mean, he has tried over and over again to get these two
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   companies to sit down and settle this because that's usually
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   what happens in cases that are similar.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   And he warned them at the opening of the trial yesterday.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   Unless it's, you know, equivalent to the secret formula for
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   Coca-Cola, what you say here is going to go public.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   And so are you sure if you want to go through with it, go
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   with it.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   And here we get Larry Page and Larry Ellison in sort of a
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   little bit of a circus getting up on stage and accusing each other
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   of things and sighing and Oracle saying, oh, we spend so much
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   money to make these APIs and they just want to steal them from
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   us.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   And Larry Page saying, you know what, all Oracle's trying to do
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   is get some money out of us because they couldn't succeed in
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   making their own smartphones.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   And there's been some quotations that Larry Ellison had said
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   that they had tried to buy or considered buying RIM or POM
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   or that sort of thing.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   But in the end, it's really kind of an obscure bit of programming
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   law, which could be precedent setting and damaging to both
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   companies no matter who wins.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   Right.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   Yeah, no, I mean, there is a sort of, the world has moved on,
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   I think, from the licensing situation as it was at the time
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   of that language's creation.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   And the model languages are presumed to be created in an
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   open source environment.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   But I don't think there's any language that's come out in the
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   last 10 years that hasn't been open source.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   I could be wrong there, but I'm fairly sure that's the way
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   that the world has moved now.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   Certainly, if you look at Go or Dart that are Google's two
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   new languages they've promoted or even the iterations of JavaScript
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   we have now, there's no presumption that anyone owns
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   chunks of that.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   Gina, do you worry that if Oracle were to win, you would have
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   problems with programming, programs that you've written
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   using APIs?
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   Absolutely.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   If the ruling is that APIs, core APIs, like the ones we're
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   talking about in Java are different than the languages themselves
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   than, yeah, that would be really bad.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   And I hope that doesn't happen.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   I think, then it just becomes open to interpretation.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   Anybody can sue anybody for using the most basic APIs or
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   objects in new languages.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   It just seems absurd.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   So I hope this doesn't go Oracle's way.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   I'm concerned about what that would mean for developers and
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   for future lawsuits.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   Explain a little bit about why that is because we talked about
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   this on Tech News today and we got a couple developers wrote in
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   and said, "Well, look, if I write in Apple's operating system,
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   they've licensed everything, so I don't have to worry about it.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   If I write for somebody else's Java runtime that's licensed
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   through Oracle, I don't have to worry about it.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   It's only on Android that I have to worry.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   But if APIs become copyrightable, what is the increased worry?"
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   Yeah, I mean, that's true.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   I mean, for indie developers, kind of making things that they,
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   from a company that have already paid the licensing phase,
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   it's not as big a deal.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   But what's the difference?
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   Is this just because Google has this huge, you know,
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   is this juggernaut and has the money and like Android's been so,
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   I mean, you know, what's the line?
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   You know, there's always that concern as soon as something gets
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   popular starts making money.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   Everybody wants a piece of it.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   Right, you may be fine now.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   It seems like the label.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   Right, but later, if you're successful, you know, it's that
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   being a target.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   Jeff, I know you're struggling with your technology.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   Am I on now?
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   You are on, sir.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   I think we've finally figured it out.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   What's your take on this whole World Series of Intellectual Property
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   Trials?
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   Well, here's the question I have, and it's really as is my one
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   and ignorant question.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   Were other industries like this or...
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   You wouldn't mute.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   I don't know if you muted yourself or what, but we can't hear you now.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   You're still talking, Jeff, but we can't hear you.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   You're talking about something long and thin.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   Jeff, it looks like he's saying something really intelligent right now.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   You got muted, Jeff.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   You got muted.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   Right, right when you were starting to ask the question.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   Did you...
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   We could see it just fine, so I feel like something just got muted
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   on the computer or something like that.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   Adventures in Skype Audio.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   Right.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   This is Oracle and Google.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   They don't want us to talk about this.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   They're doing everything in the power.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   It's a conspiracy.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   Yeah.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   All right.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   That's it.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   They've copyrighted Skype APIs.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   This is the problem.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   I think Jeff's face there was saying everything.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   Kevin, you're...
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   He's going to do a dictionary pretty soon.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   I want to hear what Jeff's dumb question was.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   He said it was...
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   Because Jeff doesn't have such a thing as a dumb question.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   Draw something, Jeff.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   Draw something.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   Okay.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   He's so mad.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   He's gonna toss that computer out the window here in a second.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   Oh, no, I can hear you again.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   Here we go.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   There we go.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   There you are.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   It's not the computer.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   It's the whole building.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   It's the whole building.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   Yes.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   Yes, we can hear you.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   It's a big booty made of metal.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   Wait, he doesn't know that we can hear him?
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   Yes, we can hear you.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   Yeah, okay.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   Now I got it.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.000]   I'm just having to...
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   Okay.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   Can you hear my dumb question or not?
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.720]   No, we heard you start your dumb question and then that was it.
[00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:49.720]   All I saw was this.
[00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:50.720]   There's something involving...
[00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:52.720]   Yeah, there was a hand.
[00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:53.720]   Involving that.
[00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:54.720]   That was all I got.
[00:15:54.720 --> 00:16:02.000]   That's the guillotine in which I'm going to put ahead of corporate IT here.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   All right.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   My local people are wonderful, but the Chancellor's Office, I'm ready to scream.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   Anyway, here's my dumb question.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:16.880]   We're in a world now not of vertical industries, but of ecosystem.
[00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:20.000]   And so I wonder whether this is becoming more prevalent.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.360]   You know, is this a vital question?
[00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:22.360]   Was it always like this?
[00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:26.840]   Was it like this in cars and refrigerators or the fact that you have companies, gigantic
[00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:32.880]   companies now, that share technology, that share business relationships that are interdependent,
[00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:39.000]   that have all kinds of more complex relationships than they used to be, is this a sign, is all
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:44.320]   this litigious hostility, one up, some of the shipping patterns, which we'll get to again
[00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:49.560]   later with Twitter, is that a sign of a new corporate infrastructure or am I just being
[00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:50.560]   ignorant?
[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:51.560]   Kevin?
[00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:52.560]   I think...
[00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:55.880]   Well, we've had some back and forth on this before.
[00:16:55.880 --> 00:17:00.040]   There was the long-running Apple Microsoft Look and Feel lawsuit.
[00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:05.480]   There was the Canyon lawsuit where Microsoft actually was found to be...
[00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:10.080]   Microsoft and Intel had a subcontractor who'd pinch code that they'd used for Apple and
[00:17:10.080 --> 00:17:11.080]   so on.
[00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:12.080]   So there was a...
[00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:13.080]   Right.
[00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:14.080]   There was a...
[00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:15.080]   There was a precedence for this, you know, 10, 15 years ago.
[00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:18.880]   But the usual, you know, detente was that you would then come to an agreement, cross-lice
[00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:20.280]   the pattern, move on.
[00:17:20.280 --> 00:17:25.120]   And it was only the sort of patent roles that basically taken a patent from a small company
[00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:31.520]   and we're using that to extract money directly, like a case show or like Eolus, that we're
[00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:33.880]   actually going around and extracting money from each other.
[00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:39.000]   And in the last year or two, there has been this outbreak of big companies suing each
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   other.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.160]   And, you know, some of it is...
[00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:46.280]   Pretent, you know, arguably fading companies suing the new ones because they're worried
[00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:47.520]   about what's going on.
[00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:50.800]   But from their point of view, they see these people as... as... as steeping their ideas,
[00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:51.800]   you know, even the...
[00:17:51.800 --> 00:17:57.080]   The Steve Jobs quote about that is quite shocking in contrast with his quotes from the mid-90s
[00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:59.680]   where he proudly says that "Great artist still."
[00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:04.800]   So there's... it's interesting to... to... to... to dynamic there.
[00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:10.880]   But it's... but the other thing is that I think that the culture has changed.
[00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:14.440]   You know, there was... there was... in the 80s, the presumption was that you would reverse
[00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:17.880]   engine ear things and there was a presumed way you could clean room something.
[00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:23.000]   So you would... you would take someone's code and establish what the API to it was by having
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.240]   a set of engineers derive that.
[00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:28.000]   Then you have another set of engineers right to that API, which was, you know, ridiculously
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.720]   time consuming, but that was how you could... you could create a clone of something.
[00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:34.120]   And that was a presumed, you know, good faith way of doing it.
[00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:37.000]   So they're arguing even against that question here.
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:40.440]   But since then there has been this sort of...
[00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:49.640]   It... it... it... it's an outbreak of... of... minor, you know, cause vexatious problems later.
[00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:55.720]   So... but, you know, the other half of this, I spent the weekend at the Wall Street Journal
[00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:59.840]   of Data Transparency, Hackathon, and I... so I was thought, "Okay, I've got to build something
[00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:00.840]   from scratch.
[00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:04.360]   Let's... let's make it half of myself by using an environment I haven't used before."
[00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:08.560]   So I set myself up with no JS on Heroku and built stuff in that.
[00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:12.600]   And the thing that was fascinating to me about that was how much that presumed that the world
[00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:14.920]   existed in GitHub.
[00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:18.720]   So with... with node, you just say, "require this thing," and it goes and pulls it down
[00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:21.600]   from GitHub and installs it for you and puts it there.
[00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:24.240]   And then when you go to deploy it, the server at the moment does the other end.
[00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:27.840]   You can say, you know, get the latest, get version X, whatever.
[00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:32.440]   And there is a presumption that all versions of everything you might want to use exist in
[00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:36.680]   the... in a repository you can get... you can get at, and you can just... you can just
[00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:39.120]   pluck it out of the net and have it working.
[00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:43.760]   And that was... you know, I knew that... you know, I knew that the world had moved in that
[00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:49.120]   direction for programmers, that we had this presumption that everything's available and
[00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:51.680]   can be fought and adjusted.
[00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:57.800]   But I think node is the first language environment that's been built after that and therefore
[00:19:57.800 --> 00:19:59.200]   takes that as its basic presumption.
[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:02.800]   It doesn't have to build a separate repository of libraries that you then have to deal with.
[00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:06.640]   And I think in some ways it's the Java legacy of having all these libraries that are bound
[00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:13.600]   up to it and a de facto part of the language, if not de sure, is what's being fought over
[00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:14.600]   here.
[00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:19.520]   And in a sense, it makes that less relevant to modern development as well.
[00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:25.120]   Yeah, I think, you know, when I'm trying to answer Jeff's question about it, has it always
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:26.240]   been like this?
[00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:28.040]   I think it goes in cycles.
[00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:34.040]   And I think, you know, what you're talking about, Kevin, is identifying people who are
[00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:38.560]   reacting to a certain part of the cycle that was beneficial to openness, right?
[00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:41.200]   This idea that, you know, we can reverse engineer.
[00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:45.840]   And I wonder... I don't know this, but I wonder if a lot of that attitude was fostered because
[00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:51.240]   a lot of the base technology was developed by government and military and therefore made
[00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:53.800]   available on a more open basis.
[00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:57.880]   The internet protocols were made available on a more open basis.
[00:20:57.880 --> 00:21:01.880]   The web was developed at Saren where they decided to release it on analysis.
[00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:02.880]   Oh, I see.
[00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:08.160]   So you're saying that the norms of this new society were set by that, then commercial
[00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:10.160]   interests came in with different structures.
[00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:11.160]   With more...
[00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:16.800]   Maybe we see it more in mobile than we see it in regular platforms is because mobile is
[00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:18.360]   operating in a different arena.
[00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:20.560]   They're not based on that same legacy.
[00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:25.200]   And so we see something that's more like the 1800s where the Edisons are all fighting against
[00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:28.720]   each other, you know, all the other innovators to decide who gets the patents and who gets
[00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:29.720]   to innovate.
[00:21:29.720 --> 00:21:35.320]   And particularly, I thought about FM radio, which was fought by RCA in the courts for
[00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:38.280]   decades because they were afraid of it.
[00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:40.440]   They didn't want it to roll out.
[00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:44.640]   And so FM radio didn't get cleared of all of its patent issues until the '60s.
[00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:47.240]   And that's why we didn't get FM until that late.
[00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:53.080]   Certainly, the media industry has a long history of patent fights back and forth.
[00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:54.080]   Television was the same.
[00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:56.160]   There was lots of stuff there from...
[00:21:56.160 --> 00:22:01.720]   And there was the canonical loan inventor story with Farnsworth fighting back against...
[00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:02.720]   Right.
[00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:04.880]   I think it was RCA again there.
[00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:08.440]   So there is some history of that.
[00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:13.400]   But I think there were generations of that in computing as well.
[00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:18.640]   There were chunks of stuff that was built and patented and fought over.
[00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:22.440]   But the model then was that you would have a sort of licensed cartel.
[00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:27.000]   You'd put together a trade group that would gather the patents up and put an agreement
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:28.200]   together like the M.P.A.
[00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:29.200]   for example.
[00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:30.200]   Sure, sure.
[00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:32.760]   And that model held for a while.
[00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:35.040]   And that was the presumption of how things worked.
[00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:40.440]   And it was often a way for the larger companies to extract rent from the smaller companies
[00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:43.760]   potentially because it meant that you had to pay that license.
[00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:49.360]   But because there was some mutual agreement around it, they would get the rates to a
[00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:50.360]   sensible level.
[00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:52.240]   And there was grandstanding that.
[00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:56.920]   When I was at Apple when we were releasing QuickTime 6, I think it was, which we incorporated
[00:22:56.920 --> 00:23:02.240]   MPEG-4, we held back the release until they changed the MPEG-4 license terms to make it
[00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:04.640]   possible for people to use it without paying the money.
[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:09.440]   And that was a fairly large piece of corporate grandstanding way Apple, if you like, because
[00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:17.760]   basically the current MPEG-4 licensing model has a floor and a ceiling to it.
[00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:22.800]   If you're sending streams less than a certain amount, it doesn't cost you anything.
[00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:27.440]   If you're implementing more than a certain amount, it's capped at several million a year,
[00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:28.280]   whatever it is.
[00:23:28.280 --> 00:23:33.320]   So that was the rule set that Apple helped them establish to actually make sure this
[00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:34.480]   stuff was usable.
[00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:37.520]   But that's still quite a lot of money.
[00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:42.640]   To Microsoft or Google or Apple, you know, five, ten billion a year is not that much.
[00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:47.040]   But for a small company that wants to compete with them in building a video streaming network,
[00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:48.120]   that is an issue.
[00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:51.520]   So there is, you know, the historic way has been problematic.
[00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:55.360]   One of the things that's interesting about Google, and it's something that Sergei Brim
[00:23:55.360 --> 00:24:00.120]   was saying this week as well, was that they were built with the presumption of an open
[00:24:00.120 --> 00:24:05.880]   internet, and their corporate culture has that as a basis.
[00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:10.320]   And I think he walked back a bit of his discussion of that in the Guardian.
[00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:16.400]   But he was basically saying that one of the threats is that the newer companies are not
[00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:19.120]   taking that, you know, are not following that example.
[00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:22.920]   And certainly it's something that we're having conversation with Microsoft execs about this,
[00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:27.120]   where they were saying, "What's Google trying to do here?
[00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:30.720]   "These open source operating systems trying to destroy us."
[00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:32.920]   And, you know, my answer was, "No, they're not trying to destroy you."
[00:24:32.920 --> 00:24:35.440]   It's just that that's their presumption of how things work.
[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:39.120]   Their worldview is the right thing to do to solve a problem is to open source something
[00:24:39.120 --> 00:24:43.720]   or create a spec, whereas Microsoft's worldview was, "Oh, we need to add a new API to Windows.
[00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:45.920]   "It's just the culture you come from."
[00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:48.320]   And that, you know, that may be changing a little bit at Google.
[00:24:48.320 --> 00:24:53.320]   Some of the stuff we've seen with Google+, and Vic Condoucher deliberately withholding
[00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:57.000]   APIs is a step away from that worldview.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:01.360]   And maybe that's, you know, their justification of that is that they're responding to more
[00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:04.080]   closely held stuff from Apple and Facebook.
[00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:06.520]   But I'm not sure that's a strong response.
[00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:13.080]   Well, Kevin, I think you're on to something here, as always.
[00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:19.360]   And a theme for the week, even, is that there are presumptions about the architecture and
[00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:21.080]   norms of the internet coming in.
[00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:25.440]   So we see this suit going on and not to get ahead of us on the list, but Kevin just brought
[00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:29.960]   up Sergey Brinden in an interview with a Guardian, and he said afterwards, "It was an interesting
[00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:32.240]   read, but it kind of distorted his views in some ways."
[00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:37.280]   What mainly he did was he walked back from criticizing the walled gardens of Facebook
[00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:38.280]   and Apple.
[00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:43.160]   And after praising them heartily for the want of future suits of negotiations, turned around
[00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:46.520]   and said, "Well, the problem was when we came on the internet, you could create an app
[00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:48.080]   with no toll booth.
[00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:50.720]   But now, basically, you want to get to users through Facebook.
[00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:52.200]   There's a toll booth there.
[00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:55.160]   You have to give a piece of what you do.
[00:25:55.160 --> 00:26:00.640]   And so you have Tim Berners-Lee saying, "Give us back our own data."
[00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:07.400]   So the Guardian is doing a week-long series about the fight over the open and free internet.
[00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:10.800]   You have Brind, by the way, saying that the greatest threat to that is not companies,
[00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:12.520]   which you'd expect, but I agree with them.
[00:26:12.520 --> 00:26:16.840]   It is governments, both tyrannies and governments like the US on piracy.
[00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:22.440]   So we have a fight now going on about the society of the net and the norms and structures
[00:26:22.440 --> 00:26:24.680]   and institutions that make it up.
[00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:26.280]   Gee, what do you think?
[00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:29.520]   Yeah, I mean, I think you're absolutely right.
[00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:31.440]   And I do think that there has been this cultural shift.
[00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:34.240]   I mean, I think the assumption, I think the reason why I would just assume that those
[00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:39.640]   Java APIs or fair game is because I think just nowadays we make platforms, right?
[00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:40.880]   Like the web is a platform.
[00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:44.800]   I was just to make things that other people can use to then make things on top of.
[00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:49.160]   And of course, Brind was going to say that the web should be open because if it's not
[00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:51.240]   open, then Google can't search it.
[00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:56.440]   I mean, that's the whole Google's whole premise is on the idea that all this information is
[00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:59.760]   going to be out there and open.
[00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:04.000]   And sure, you have to sign into Facebook to use Facebook apps or to use Facebook, but
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.120]   Facebook is still a platform as well.
[00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:12.240]   But I forget what the initial question is.
[00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:16.640]   Oh, getting back to what Kevin said was saying earlier about Heroku, assuming that GitHub
[00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:18.040]   repositories are just available.
[00:27:18.040 --> 00:27:24.120]   I mean, I think this is a fantastic kind of cultural shift around the idea that you create
[00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:28.840]   things, you modularize them, you make them available to the public for everyone to use.
[00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:33.160]   And the default setting is that it is available for anyone to use.
[00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:37.320]   And this kind of goes into another story not to jump ahead, but the IPA agreement that
[00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:38.320]   Twitter put out.
[00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:40.120]   It's a really important story of the week.
[00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:41.120]   But yeah.
[00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:42.120]   Yeah.
[00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:43.120]   Yeah.
[00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:44.120]   And it's not about beer.
[00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:45.120]   It's a different idea.
[00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:46.120]   It's not a different idea.
[00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:47.120]   It's not in the apparel.
[00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:48.120]   It's not a good IPA.
[00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:49.120]   Yeah.
[00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:53.120]   I'm not sure I prefer the IPA beer over the thing that Twitter's doing.
[00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:54.480]   But what Twitter's doing is pretty interesting too.
[00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:56.040]   We're going to take a quick break.
[00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:57.040]   We'll come back.
[00:27:57.040 --> 00:27:58.040]   We're going to talk about that.
[00:27:58.040 --> 00:27:59.040]   We're going to talk about the stock split.
[00:27:59.040 --> 00:28:03.040]   We'll talk a little bit more about this battle for control of the internet series.
[00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:07.880]   But I want to tell you about Stamps.com, our sponsor for this week in Google, everyone
[00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:13.040]   knows going to the post office is a hassle, the limited hours, the parking.
[00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:16.640]   That's why we recommend Stamps.com, the fastest and easiest way to buy and print real
[00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:20.320]   U.S. postage for any letter or package right from your desk.
[00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:23.760]   You'll never have to go to the post office again.
[00:28:23.760 --> 00:28:25.480]   You'll get an easier way.
[00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:27.120]   You'll get a good rate.
[00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:29.040]   All you need is a computer and a printer.
[00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:31.800]   And you can use Stamps 24/7 whenever you need it.
[00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:34.040]   You don't have to work at somebody else's schedule.
[00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:38.200]   Post office might be closed, but Stamps.com is always open.
[00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:44.360]   We get all kinds of good examples from people who are using Stamps.com with their business.
[00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:48.800]   One person says they're amazed how it makes it easy to access all the services of the
[00:28:48.800 --> 00:28:51.600]   post office, including international and certified mail.
[00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:54.240]   You might think, "Oh, I got to go fill out those forms of the office."
[00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:56.720]   No, Stamps.com even offers discounts.
[00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:58.920]   You can't get anywhere else.
[00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:03.440]   Like 21% off on Express mail, 15% off on priority mail.
[00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:04.680]   It saves you time.
[00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:06.320]   The postage costs less too.
[00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:08.680]   What's not to love right now?
[00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:12.520]   Stamps.com is going to make it even better because you're watching Twig special offer
[00:29:12.520 --> 00:29:14.200]   for our listeners.
[00:29:14.200 --> 00:29:17.760]   Use the promo code Twig and get a no risk trial.
[00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:19.840]   You see that radio mic up there.
[00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:21.760]   You want to click on that?
[00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:22.760]   Go to Stamps.com.
[00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:24.080]   Click on that microphone.
[00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:27.600]   Type in Twig, T-W-I-G.
[00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:29.040]   Press the go button.
[00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:31.280]   And all of a sudden, you saw that $88 thing.
[00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:38.040]   It's now a $110 bonus offer, including the digital scale and $55 free postage.
[00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:39.040]   Can't beat it, folks.
[00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:40.040]   Check it out.
[00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:41.040]   Stamps.com.
[00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:42.040]   Before you do anything else.
[00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:43.920]   Go save yourself some money on postage.
[00:29:43.920 --> 00:29:49.160]   If you do any amount of shipping or mailing at all, it's going to make it worthwhile.
[00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:50.160]   And you get the free scale.
[00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:51.800]   If nothing else, you've got a cool scale.
[00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:52.960]   But you're going to save money too.
[00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:53.960]   So go check it out.
[00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:54.960]   Stamps.com.
[00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:57.200]   We thank them for their support of this week in Google.
[00:29:57.200 --> 00:30:00.200]   We mentioned the battle for control of the Internet series on the Guardian.
[00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:02.800]   Tim Berners-Lee in there today.
[00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:04.800]   Sergey Brin was in there Monday.
[00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:10.400]   We talked about him being beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny
[00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:12.360]   of evil companies and governments.
[00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:13.360]   He made it clear today.
[00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:15.080]   I was mostly talking about the governments.
[00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:17.920]   He even admitted Google's got some ways to go with openness.
[00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:19.760]   He's like, we can improve too.
[00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:24.920]   Tim Berners-Lee today talking about how we need to demand our information from Google
[00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:25.920]   and Facebook.
[00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:27.680]   He's like, yeah, sure, you can get your Facebook archive.
[00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:31.120]   And yeah, Google's providing you more and more access to information.
[00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:35.800]   He's like, but we need to have immediate access to all the data they hold on us all the time.
[00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:40.280]   He says it's interesting that people throughout the existence of the web have been concerned
[00:30:40.280 --> 00:30:41.280]   about monopolies.
[00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:45.400]   They were concerned about Netscape having complete control over the browser market until
[00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:49.200]   suddenly they started worrying that Microsoft had complete control of the browser market.
[00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:53.960]   So I think one of the lessons is that things can change very rapidly.
[00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:54.960]   People adopt things.
[00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:58.560]   He actually brought up a story about gopher, somebody being concerned about gopher in the
[00:30:58.560 --> 00:30:59.560]   early days.
[00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:00.960]   He said, you know what?
[00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:06.080]   As rapidly as people accepted gopher, they didn't, they got rid of it just as rapidly
[00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:08.080]   when something better came along.
[00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:12.000]   So it was a little bit of a reassuring like, look, we need to demand the stuff and we can
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   get it.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.440]   Google and Facebook won't always be in charge.
[00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:16.440]   Absolutely.
[00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:22.080]   To this story, I say, Alleluia.
[00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:25.720]   I mean, obviously I work on an app called ThinkUp, the whole premise of the app is that
[00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:28.560]   it pulls all your social data from different networks.
[00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:32.480]   And I just, I believe very strongly, I mean, feature zero and any piece of software should
[00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:35.360]   be you should be able to get out all the data that you put in.
[00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:40.560]   But even beyond that, we're pumping so much interesting social personal, intimate data
[00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:43.880]   about ourselves and our lives and all these disparate systems.
[00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:46.960]   And we have the right, we should have the right, not only to have all that data, but
[00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:52.880]   to have it in a tool that gives us insights about ourselves that do more than just inform
[00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:54.080]   advertising companies, right?
[00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:58.160]   Which is what companies like Facebook and Twitter and all these other social networks
[00:31:58.160 --> 00:31:59.640]   want to do with your data.
[00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:00.640]   Nothing wrong with that.
[00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:01.880]   I'm not going to argue with Jeff about that.
[00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:03.360]   I mean, there's nothing wrong with that.
[00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:05.400]   More effective advertising is fine.
[00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:09.480]   But also there are other stories about our lives and other things we can figure out about
[00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:14.120]   ourselves and learn about ourselves if we had all that data in one place and was able
[00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:17.080]   to access it and slice and dice it and look at different ways.
[00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:20.560]   And I'm not going to make this into a commercial for ThinkUp, but this is, I feel really strongly
[00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:23.080]   about this and this is why I'm building ThinkUp.
[00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:27.760]   And I think, and I want to see a lot more tools that are kind of like this kind of layer
[00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:32.240]   on top of all these social tools that exist that other companies own, right?
[00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:35.960]   I want to see kind of the, I want to create actually the Uber network, which is this peer
[00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:41.120]   to peer network, which piggybacks on top of and aggregates all these silos owned by different
[00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:47.280]   companies that help people do more interesting things and find out more about themselves
[00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:51.160]   in their lives and how they can make it better with all this data that we're generating every
[00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:53.200]   day and feeding to these companies.
[00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:56.240]   Gene, I think that's so the right way to put it.
[00:32:56.240 --> 00:33:00.640]   The debate in the privacy terms that I often deal with is about the right to be forgotten
[00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:06.400]   and to kill the data and get rid of the data, but in which one understands part two, because
[00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:09.720]   you're saying somebody else has it out of control over it, you're turning that around
[00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:14.120]   180 degrees and saying, well, when we create this, there's value to it that we're not able
[00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:15.120]   to get out.
[00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:16.120]   Yes.
[00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:20.480]   And if you enable applications like ThinkUp app and others and that layer you just spoke
[00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:27.160]   of, then we all understand the value that comes from that in new and important ways and then
[00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:32.440]   shows the value of sharing and goes to the things that I want to see about the internet.
[00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:35.680]   And I salute that flag and whistle Dixie to it.
[00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:36.680]   Well, not Dixie.
[00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:38.680]   I'll be strong to make a better.
[00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:39.680]   A couple of parts.
[00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:40.680]   Grapes of wrath.
[00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:41.680]   Wait.
[00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:42.680]   Whatever.
[00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:43.680]   What's up?
[00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:44.680]   Not Dixie.
[00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:45.680]   Not Dixie.
[00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:46.680]   No.
[00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:47.680]   Kevin, did you read this Tim Burders Lee article?
[00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:48.680]   Did you get a chance to take a look at it?
[00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:49.680]   Yes, I did.
[00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:50.680]   Yes.
[00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:52.560]   I thought it was very good.
[00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:59.640]   Tim is very good at spotting long-term threats and things as well.
[00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:04.720]   So he speaks with the authority of building the internet in the first place, of building
[00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:06.480]   the web in the first place rather.
[00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:12.360]   But he's warning about the problem of things moving inside these environments too.
[00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:17.280]   And as someone was pointing out in the chat room, who was that?
[00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:23.560]   Twitter is a great example of this.
[00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:26.880]   They've been sort of saying, oh, that's kind of hard on me.
[00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:28.640]   I haven't got enough people for the last four years.
[00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:32.960]   When they've been able to people, they employ has gone on by four as a magnitude.
[00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:35.600]   So I think there's some fishiness there as well.
[00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:39.920]   And I think it will be great if they could just give you a download thing that both Google
[00:34:39.920 --> 00:34:43.440]   and Facebook have done at least something towards that there.
[00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:47.200]   So Twitter is not like the shining light here, even though the IPA thing is a bit of
[00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:48.200]   a good thing.
[00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:49.200]   Let me ask you.
[00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:51.200]   I'm sorry, Kevin, go ahead.
[00:34:51.200 --> 00:35:00.040]   He said the other thing that Tim Benansey was talking about was the UK government surveillance
[00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:05.200]   program, which is being discussed at the moment, but they haven't actually put a bill together.
[00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:10.480]   They're trying to basically, they're trying to put a bill that allows them to keep track
[00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:16.040]   of not the contents of what you send, but who you're sending it to, I think, is what
[00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:18.680]   they're trying to do, which is something they've tried to get through before.
[00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:24.400]   And there's a lot of pre- don't always about that going on at the moment.
[00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:28.760]   There is also, I'll give them into the end of the program, but there's also currently
[00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:34.240]   going on by the UK government, an open standards and patents consultation where they're asking
[00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:36.120]   for people's opinions on this.
[00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:39.640]   And it would be really great to send us more opinions that are patents are a wonderful
[00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:43.600]   thing and open standards are a threat to businesses, which is a lot of the stuff they've been
[00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:46.600]   getting from the big players already.
[00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:54.320]   Yeah, I feel like that surveillance and the SISPA bill that's here in the United States
[00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:58.680]   have the same issues, which they're not like SOPA, where people are like, wait, do we even
[00:35:58.680 --> 00:35:59.680]   need this at all?
[00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:02.200]   I think everyone says, well, we do need a way to catch bad guys.
[00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:06.960]   Okay, we all agree on that, but is this law the way to catch bad guys?
[00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:10.960]   You know, is being able to log everyone's emails and where they were going, the right
[00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:11.960]   thing to do?
[00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:12.960]   Is it over-broad?
[00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:16.520]   And that's where the debate is about these things.
[00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:20.800]   I feel a little more hope for these sorts of laws that they at least possibly could be
[00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:25.800]   whittled down into something that's usable and acceptable to civil liberties, unlike
[00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:28.320]   SOPA, which I felt like was just dead in the water.
[00:36:28.320 --> 00:36:33.560]   Well, yes and no, I agree with Sergey Brin here that the greatest threat to internet
[00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:36.160]   freedom is government.
[00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:42.880]   And whether that is tyrannies filtering the internet for dissent, as Sergey said, or whether
[00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:47.760]   it is governments of Canada and Australia going after the entirety of the internet for
[00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:55.360]   child porn or the US for piracy or this UK effort for security, we have to be very, very
[00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:57.280]   cautious about that.
[00:36:57.280 --> 00:37:00.520]   And I think that government fanciies itself as the protector of our freedom and on the
[00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:02.160]   internet, it is the opposite.
[00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:06.360]   And I'm not trying to come out like an anti-government person either on the, you know, on any end
[00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:10.760]   of the spectrum from Tea Party to Occupy Wall Street, but I am trying to say that we better
[00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:11.760]   be damned cautious.
[00:37:11.760 --> 00:37:20.520]   Well, when the government comes and says, hey, I want to be able to tap a phone of a drug
[00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:24.520]   dealer, gangster, criminal murderer, et cetera, I'm okay with that.
[00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:25.520]   Right.
[00:37:25.520 --> 00:37:26.520]   Well, there are principles involved.
[00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:30.880]   You know, one principle involved is that our email communication is sacrosanct and our
[00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:35.280]   phone communication is sacrosanct to the extent that you have to get a warrant to go after.
[00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:36.280]   So that's not the way I am.
[00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:38.120]   And I think that should be the way with the email too.
[00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:43.200]   I agree, right, and, but it's not the case that our private communication should be presumed
[00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:50.280]   to be private by government unless there is just cause and a warrant in due process.
[00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:54.480]   And so the issue here is, as always, is not technology.
[00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:55.480]   It is principles.
[00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:59.160]   And you deal with this at the level of principles and then the technology fits in that.
[00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:02.880]   What we're trying to do is create new laws that deal with technology and what things
[00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:05.720]   that people don't understand and principles get lost.
[00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:07.800]   That's where the real danger is.
[00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:10.680]   I think with last year, I sure go ahead, Jeff.
[00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:16.200]   Gina, back to your point where Kevin started on this was describe for me an architecture
[00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:21.840]   and a set of APIs and a set of things that in the layer you describe and the layer that
[00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:28.440]   you indeed are building, what is it as a principle that you would expect of Twitter, Facebook,
[00:38:28.440 --> 00:38:32.880]   Google and so on, the things that we're usually talking about in terms of green our data.
[00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:35.480]   What does that look like?
[00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:37.400]   What form do you need it in?
[00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:38.480]   What is legitimately ours?
[00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:39.480]   What isn't?
[00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:41.440]   Because once I interact with somebody else, I don't just own the information.
[00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:42.440]   So do you.
[00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:43.440]   I put a picture up of you.
[00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:44.880]   We both have a claim on it.
[00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:47.080]   There's issues that get very complicated immediately.
[00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:50.800]   But think up is the beginning of an architecture that I think goes exactly what a producer
[00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:52.920]   is talking about is give me what's mine.
[00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:55.920]   How do you describe that world at a level of principles?
[00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:58.440]   Yeah, well, that's a really good question.
[00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:02.880]   I mean, I think data liberation is like just kind of chips at the beginning of it.
[00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:04.200]   It's just giving me my stuff.
[00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:07.800]   I mean, the question of the data that you collaborate with others on, which is pretty
[00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:13.440]   much everything, I mean, an email conversation, do I own or apply to my email or comment on
[00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:14.680]   my post?
[00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:17.720]   I believe I have part ownership in that.
[00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:21.720]   So I mean, the problem with data liberation is that when you just export your own data,
[00:39:21.720 --> 00:39:26.720]   it's kind of useless when it's not plugged into this architecture of people.
[00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:30.640]   Right, it's lost all context and it's often very collaborative.
[00:39:30.640 --> 00:39:38.160]   So to me, it's a peer-to-peer network with full featured APIs that offer you access to
[00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:43.280]   your own information as well as your interactions with others and their responses to that information.
[00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:47.520]   Because we're not just publishing, we're not just broadcasting statements here.
[00:39:47.520 --> 00:39:50.800]   We're having conversations online and this is the publishing industry is going through
[00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:51.720]   this change as well.
[00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:57.880]   So the biggest point is that APIs should let you access all of your data.
[00:39:57.880 --> 00:40:00.120]   And a few people brought this up in the chat room.
[00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:05.240]   Twitter's API does not let you easily get more than 3,200 tweets, right?
[00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:06.680]   Because they're the pulse of the moment.
[00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:09.560]   I think there are scaling issues and there's a lot of tweets in cold storage.
[00:40:09.560 --> 00:40:13.480]   And I understand that Twitter is running a huge operation, but it still really bugs me.
[00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:17.480]   And part of the reason why I built ThinkUp is because of that sort of arbitrary limitation.
[00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:22.560]   Facebook lets you download your data to a bunch of HTML files.
[00:40:22.560 --> 00:40:23.560]   That's okay.
[00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:24.560]   That's a start.
[00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:31.160]   But the goal that I want to get to is something much more robust and alive.
[00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:36.080]   I mean, I think these have to be sort of live APIs that run and that talk to one another
[00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:37.080]   on a continuous basis.
[00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:41.320]   I don't think this is a one time downloads that file deal.
[00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:45.720]   And I think that it does involve getting data that you've collaborated with others.
[00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:51.120]   >> But Tom, if I may hijack for a moment longer, Kevin, you've built pieces of this architecture
[00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:54.400]   around the edges of identity.
[00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:57.840]   What have your view of this more open architecture?
[00:40:57.840 --> 00:41:01.000]   >> Well, I think, I think, Judith, spot on.
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:05.160]   The thing is you need to put something that is actually fungible.
[00:41:05.160 --> 00:41:07.120]   You can actually move between services.
[00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:12.280]   So that points to writing open specs about how to do this rather than one particular company's
[00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:13.280]   API.
[00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:19.320]   So one of the thing that's been less encouraging over the last few years has been the sort of
[00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:25.840]   the growth of a bunch of APIs from each company that are all variations on a theme in many
[00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:26.840]   cases.
[00:41:26.840 --> 00:41:29.760]   But they're not actually converging on protocols as much as they used to.
[00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:35.520]   So part of the work we did with OpenSocial and then with other other specs like true
[00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:40.400]   activity streams and portable contacts was designed to convert some of this stuff.
[00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:43.080]   And there's still work going on around that area.
[00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:47.040]   There's the OpenID Connect work that's going on at the moment.
[00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:51.080]   It's trying to converge some of that initial login and getting your personal profile stuff
[00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:52.080]   out.
[00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:59.640]   But most of these companies have backed away from converging on the shape of the data that
[00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:00.640]   they're sharing.
[00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:02.520]   And I think that's a shame.
[00:42:02.520 --> 00:42:05.920]   To some extent, you can transform it.
[00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:10.000]   There's a lot of decent work going on where people will pull stuff from several formats
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   and munch them together.
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:16.880]   If you think about if this then that, that's an example of one company that's trying to
[00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:20.640]   sort of provide all the shims to translate things to one to another.
[00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:24.120]   But you don't really want to have a translation between every two endpoints.
[00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:26.000]   It's much better if you've got a common format in between.
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:28.080]   It just makes life so much easier for everyone.
[00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:32.880]   And that's the piece that we've moved away from to some extent in the last few years.
[00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:38.200]   I think a lot of this is coming back to your point earlier about the architecture and a
[00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:39.200]   level of principles.
[00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:43.160]   Whether those principles are the ones that Gina described in terms of being able to
[00:42:43.160 --> 00:42:46.720]   have access to information, whether the ones that Kevin describes in terms of
[00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:51.360]   having the ability to have APIs to give us our tracks, the ones that you brought up
[00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:55.560]   in discussion in terms of government and mail and things like that.
[00:42:55.560 --> 00:43:01.680]   I fear and the things that I yammer on about privacy and publicness is that if we lose
[00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:07.840]   sight of these principles of this society we're building and get into these weeds, we're
[00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:09.600]   going to lose the battles.
[00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:14.800]   And that's why I like what Sir Tim was talking about and to an extent what Sergey was talking
[00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:18.640]   about, what my colleagues here have been talking about is I think we've got to get that level
[00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:20.600]   of discussion up to principles.
[00:43:20.600 --> 00:43:21.600]   Yeah.
[00:43:21.600 --> 00:43:25.520]   And I think the internet has been significantly good about doing that.
[00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:32.880]   We may have some short-term memory loss and get distracted from time to time.
[00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:37.120]   But when it gets important people rise up and say, "Well, wait a minute.
[00:43:37.120 --> 00:43:39.440]   No, that's not how we want this to work."
[00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:44.440]   And there is a culture built into the internet of working around whatever is trying to get
[00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:47.000]   in our way, which is what Gina taught me.
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:52.280]   That hackers will hack around and we can't necessarily afford that luxury anymore.
[00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:53.280]   Yeah.
[00:43:53.280 --> 00:43:56.160]   Oh, I think there's always a way to hack around, but you're right.
[00:43:56.160 --> 00:44:00.680]   We shouldn't rely on it solely and just say, "In the meantime, a law will get passed,
[00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:02.720]   but you can't hack around without going to jail."
[00:44:02.720 --> 00:44:04.760]   Then you go move to sealant.
[00:44:04.760 --> 00:44:05.760]   Yeah.
[00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:09.080]   Probably not the end solution.
[00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:10.080]   But yeah, I don't swim.
[00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:16.320]   No, you need to keep one eye on maybe one and a half eyes on what the governments are doing
[00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:18.920]   because they're finally noticing.
[00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:23.800]   And then the other eye on building things like think up, building things like mesh networks,
[00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:24.800]   building--
[00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:25.800]   That's the best answer.
[00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:27.760]   --the ways to move around at the same time.
[00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:32.680]   That and not to jump ahead, but when we talk about Twitter IPA, that's also an effort to
[00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:33.680]   create a new principle.
[00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:35.560]   And that's a good way to attack this.
[00:44:35.560 --> 00:44:36.760]   This is all making me very thirsty.
[00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:38.720]   We need to talk about IPA in a second.
[00:44:38.720 --> 00:44:43.560]   So I want to take a quick break and thank one of our other sponsors, GoToMyPC.
[00:44:43.560 --> 00:44:44.760]   Picture this.
[00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:48.040]   If I can paint you a picture, you're on your way home after work.
[00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:49.040]   It's dark.
[00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:50.040]   It's raining.
[00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:51.040]   Okay, maybe it's not raining.
[00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:52.040]   That's kind of depressing.
[00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:55.840]   But you check your iPhone and you see an urgent request that needs your immediate attention.
[00:44:55.840 --> 00:44:58.040]   Dramatic music plays behind you.
[00:44:58.040 --> 00:45:00.960]   Don't go back to the office and log on to your computer.
[00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:01.960]   That place is a cube farm.
[00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:02.960]   It's horrible.
[00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:03.960]   Here's a better way.
[00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:06.560]   Use Citrix's new GoToMyPC app for iPhones.
[00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:08.960]   Like having your work computer right in your pocket.
[00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:11.240]   Take care of all those last minute requests from anywhere.
[00:45:11.240 --> 00:45:14.480]   You can still stop in the pub and get an IPA on your way home.
[00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:15.480]   Edit your PowerPoints.
[00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:16.480]   Update your spreadsheets.
[00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:18.640]   Work on any file right from your iPhone.
[00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:23.120]   You can also log on to your Mac or PC with GoToMyPC app for iPad.
[00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:24.120]   That's right.
[00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:25.120]   You can use your PC.
[00:45:25.120 --> 00:45:26.880]   Use your Windows PC on your iPad.
[00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:31.760]   The GoToMyPC apps give you the best of both worlds, more freedom and more power.
[00:45:31.760 --> 00:45:32.760]   And it sets up in minutes.
[00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:34.360]   You don't even need IT to get involved.
[00:45:34.360 --> 00:45:35.720]   I know that makes Jeff happy.
[00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:40.040]   So now you can use your iPad and your iPhone to access all of your documents and applications
[00:45:40.040 --> 00:45:43.800]   stored on your home or office computer anywhere you go.

[00:45:47.120 --> 00:45:48.120]   free.

[00:46:10.120 --> 00:46:12.640]   We thank them for their support of This Week in Google.
[00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:17.560]   Now, let me make clear that the IT staff here at the community graduate school of journalism
[00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:18.720]   is the one that rescued me.
[00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:19.720]   I love them dearly.
[00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:20.720]   They're wonderful.
[00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:22.720]   It's always the next level up the line.
[00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:26.120]   It causes some new thing that causes me problems that I'm sorry to complain.
[00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:28.680]   I want to make clear here because otherwise my life here would be miserable because I
[00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:29.680]   need them.
[00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:32.760]   No, not all IT departments are the same.
[00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:33.760]   No.
[00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:35.760]   I'm upset the IT department, Jeff.
[00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:36.760]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:46:36.760 --> 00:46:37.760]   I'm much smarter than that.
[00:46:37.760 --> 00:46:38.760]   Never long.
[00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:40.000]   I wasn't trying to get your trouble.
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:46.440]   Let's talk about this innovator's patent agreement.
[00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:49.840]   That's what IPA is actually standing for in this Twitter situation.
[00:46:49.840 --> 00:46:55.560]   Seems to be a reaction to Yahoo's suit on Facebook where they took some older patents
[00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:58.720]   and went after Facebook and some of the people who had helped them with those patents were
[00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:02.720]   a little upset now that they were no longer at Yahoo that they were being used in this
[00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:03.720]   way.
[00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:06.040]   That's a reaction to this whole insanity we're into.
[00:47:06.040 --> 00:47:07.040]   Well, exactly.
[00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:10.040]   The wider patent fiasco that's going on.
[00:47:10.040 --> 00:47:16.440]   Twitter has a policy here that says we will not use our patents for anything unless it's
[00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:22.640]   defensive and you get to approve how we get to control how we use the patents you're
[00:47:22.640 --> 00:47:24.120]   involved with as an employee.
[00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:28.840]   Even if we sell them to somebody else down the line, that company has to get your sign
[00:47:28.840 --> 00:47:29.840]   off when they use the patent.
[00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:33.680]   Or the very clever way they did it was that not just that so much as that if they
[00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:41.800]   if that company tries to use it to attack if company A attacks company B and you're you
[00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:45.480]   you had a role in the patent in the middle as the way I understand it is you get you
[00:47:45.480 --> 00:47:52.680]   retain the right thanks to Twitter to license to grant a license to company B thus cutting
[00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:55.760]   the company A off of the knees.
[00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:59.320]   Is that okay so you can be your in control of that patents.
[00:47:59.320 --> 00:48:04.800]   Yeah, to go out to that extent that you can license the person being attacked in an offensive
[00:48:04.800 --> 00:48:05.960]   way.
[00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:09.360]   The whole point being that they want to make sure that the patents you work on are used
[00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:12.400]   as a shield rather than as a weapon.
[00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:15.240]   This is so this is something they introduced in one of their I can't remember what they
[00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:19.400]   call it but it's it's kind of a regular hacker meeting that they have within the company.
[00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:23.160]   And then the next argument that came out from some people and somebody some guy Forbes
[00:48:23.160 --> 00:48:27.600]   poo poo this little poo poo saying well what does that now that Twitter has no business
[00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:33.360]   model it now has no patent value and you know what does this do to your fiduciary responsibility
[00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:34.800]   to Wall Street.
[00:48:34.800 --> 00:48:38.720]   Yeah, I take the point that if you would assume that all business models are repacious and
[00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:43.440]   ugly and awful and evil then yes maybe you reduce the value but I really salute Twitter
[00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:47.800]   here unless I'm missing something I majorly salute Twitter here for standing up on once
[00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:53.920]   again a new principle and it's it's a way to I think undercut the war and also to set
[00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:54.920]   a new standard.
[00:48:54.920 --> 00:49:00.960]   So Twitter does this we have we have the responsibility folks to go to Google and Facebook and Microsoft
[00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:05.560]   and and name the company and say what about you.
[00:49:05.560 --> 00:49:07.400]   I heard you groaning there Gina.
[00:49:07.400 --> 00:49:11.800]   I mean you know what this you know what this does to the value of the company it makes
[00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:17.480]   really great talent of engineers who care about how their work is used to work for you.
[00:49:17.480 --> 00:49:22.000]   I mean sister and it's just there aren't very many companies that I feel like I really
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:26.080]   want to work for this place this agreement makes me want to work for Twitter and this
[00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:27.440]   agreement gives us.
[00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:28.440]   Twitter.
[00:49:28.440 --> 00:49:31.920]   I really know but Twitter Twitter.
[00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:36.760]   You can get Gina thinking now.
[00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:44.080]   And it also sort of arms me with a negotiation you know part of my negotiation of you know
[00:49:44.080 --> 00:49:47.440]   whatever next job that I have well it's not going to be for a while so I'm trying to
[00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:51.360]   try to make my own jobs here but but but I can go to any company that I want to work
[00:49:51.360 --> 00:49:54.840]   for and say in my salary negotiation say hey you know I want this to.
[00:49:54.840 --> 00:49:58.240]   But I'm going to file a patent patent while I'm your employee a patent that's going to
[00:49:58.240 --> 00:50:02.480]   have my name on it a patent on something I created and this I want this kind of control.
[00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:07.840]   You know I saw a lot of people say you know this is just this is just a PR move to recruit
[00:50:07.840 --> 00:50:15.600]   talent they if it certainly was a great recruitment move and that you know defensive can be you
[00:50:15.600 --> 00:50:20.040]   know the using a patent defensively can be interpreted very broadly and it doesn't really
[00:50:20.040 --> 00:50:21.880]   mean anything.
[00:50:21.880 --> 00:50:26.400]   The truth is this is better than the current situation or the situation that my co-worker
[00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:31.160]   Andy Bea was in when his company was bought by Yahoo and now you know a patent that his
[00:50:31.160 --> 00:50:33.360]   name is on is being used to sue Facebook.
[00:50:33.360 --> 00:50:37.480]   If he had known better you know his conclusion was I will never file another patent.
[00:50:37.480 --> 00:50:41.400]   Okay I can see that but if you have to file patents you want to do it with this with this
[00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:42.400]   new agreement.
[00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:46.400]   And the reason why I think that that Twitter is sincere about this is that Twitter has
[00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:50.960]   just has been on as a role they've just been releasing all these open source modules.
[00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:56.240]   Boot bootstrap is my favorite kind of layout framework for making new websites.
[00:50:56.240 --> 00:51:00.720]   Twitter just released a bunch of changes they made to MySQL for you know for everyone to
[00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:05.160]   use and check out and the IPA is I think it's like creative commons license or it's an open
[00:51:05.160 --> 00:51:09.760]   license it's not exactly open source but I just love the way that Twitter is making
[00:51:09.760 --> 00:51:10.760]   it.
[00:51:10.760 --> 00:51:15.760]   It's making a name for itself by you know modularizing its work making it reusable for
[00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:19.400]   other tech companies and setting an example and really coming out looking like the place
[00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:23.720]   that you want to be if you're an engineer except for the 3200 tweet thing.
[00:51:23.720 --> 00:51:27.000]   The IPA thing is great thing.
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:30.840]   All the support of other you know open stands as well there's there's definitely been a
[00:51:30.840 --> 00:51:35.040]   lack of Twitter people in the open standards community for the last five years since Blaine
[00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:38.040]   and Colet.
[00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:42.840]   I mean every every company has their their advantages and disadvantages the IPA this is
[00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:47.520]   this is a good thing I've definitely yeah it says something something that we want to
[00:51:47.520 --> 00:51:49.960]   look at at Salesforce is if we can adopt it too.
[00:51:49.960 --> 00:51:55.040]   Peter Yarrad wrote a column up on CNET he's a former son employee and he was complaining
[00:51:55.040 --> 00:52:00.560]   how essentially when he left Sun and started a company he had to violate his own patents
[00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:05.000]   to do what at that point had become widespread methods of building web applications and that
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:10.200]   he wishes that this was the standard he's like fortunately Sun like Twitter only used
[00:52:10.200 --> 00:52:17.760]   patents defensively but here we have Oracle who bought Sun now using patents you know
[00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:22.200]   there's at least two patents in that Oracle Google case that they're going after Google
[00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:29.800]   for could this become a virus that infects the tech community in a positive way and and
[00:52:29.800 --> 00:52:33.360]   ends the patent wars or are we always going to have an Oracle that's going to hold out
[00:52:33.360 --> 00:52:37.240]   and say you know what no I'm going to ruin this or a Yahoo.
[00:52:37.240 --> 00:52:41.040]   The problem is that that is the problem the problem is that yeah that we can you know
[00:52:41.040 --> 00:52:44.240]   we've had these sort of mutual non-sewing agreements which is what the patent licensing
[00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:49.240]   calls are in effect are all across licensing pools that happen but they're not they're
[00:52:49.240 --> 00:52:54.400]   not you know abated by that by the trolls it doesn't take many of these patents to be
[00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:58.440]   issued then bought and sold through you know through companies going out of business and
[00:52:58.440 --> 00:53:02.840]   someone buys the patents from the corpse and then goes around with no actual business
[00:53:02.840 --> 00:53:06.920]   to defend just a sort of shell company owned by lawyers that goes around suing everyone.
[00:53:06.920 --> 00:53:11.400]   So Mark Cuban just read a post about this because he's getting some grief because he's
[00:53:11.400 --> 00:53:16.480]   just invested invested in Vringo which is a patent role company he's and he's he's saying
[00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:20.360]   the biggest business risk you don't know about it's your business will be sued over patents
[00:53:20.360 --> 00:53:24.480]   and your only possible defense is to invest in patent trolls or telcomic is about it and
[00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:29.560]   I wish he'd taken the telcomic about it rude rather than the investing patent trolls frankly
[00:53:29.560 --> 00:53:32.720]   but maybe he can do both.
[00:53:32.720 --> 00:53:35.840]   Well he wants to make some money on he sees how many how much money the patent trolls
[00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:39.080]   are making the guys the guys all about making money I guess.
[00:53:39.080 --> 00:53:45.960]   I suppose that the theory that Peter Yarritt is putting forth on this column is that if
[00:53:45.960 --> 00:53:51.560]   enough employees get this right from enough different companies then enough companies will
[00:53:51.560 --> 00:53:58.480]   find that a lot of the patents that they're working with or or dealing with are controlled
[00:53:58.480 --> 00:54:03.000]   by employees and there won't be enough patents that aren't controlled by employees that want
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:08.240]   to use them defensively to to allow to fuel the wars so to speak.
[00:54:08.240 --> 00:54:13.760]   Jeff do you think that's you know I do fear that that and I'm accused of being Pollyanna
[00:54:13.760 --> 00:54:19.200]   and I think that right now we're all being a bit Pollyanna because you have the fact that
[00:54:19.200 --> 00:54:23.240]   you know Microsoft just spent one billion dollars for AOL patents more than gonna say
[00:54:23.240 --> 00:54:30.440]   why is that chicken chicken livers you know you have Google buying Motorola and great
[00:54:30.440 --> 00:54:35.160]   measure to get the patents and on and on and on and on there's a huge investment made
[00:54:35.160 --> 00:54:40.200]   in these patents so I don't know what we can do about the past.
[00:54:40.200 --> 00:54:45.000]   Well I mean part of part of the thing is that the you know as you say the government is
[00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:48.160]   sort of paying attention but also the culture is changing and that the people in general
[00:54:48.160 --> 00:54:53.360]   are paying attention I think that the Eolos lawsuit being overturned in February in East
[00:54:53.360 --> 00:54:58.920]   Texas and basically having their patent revoked by an ordinary jury is a really encouraging
[00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:03.720]   yeah I agree with all that I'm just I'm just matching Tom's question here is what are we
[00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:08.720]   being too optimistic to some Kevin's not because he says no this is a good this isn't gonna
[00:55:08.720 --> 00:55:11.840]   change this isn't gonna get rid of the oracles of the world.
[00:55:11.840 --> 00:55:20.480]   It's gonna change quickly but we you know I think that the sort of not producing anything
[00:55:20.480 --> 00:55:26.600]   sitting there being parasitic suing people for patents isn't a long term sustainable business
[00:55:26.600 --> 00:55:30.760]   model precisely because it is parasitic and obviously parasitic and we will eventually
[00:55:30.760 --> 00:55:34.680]   move against it as a society but in the meantime yeah there are people who are gonna continue
[00:55:34.680 --> 00:55:39.800]   doing that it's not a new problem I had a patent troll lawsuit against my company in
[00:55:39.800 --> 00:55:45.680]   1990 that was that was you know completely species but tied us up for you know nine months
[00:55:45.680 --> 00:55:49.840]   and made up made our products and not get a version too so yeah this is a this is a long
[00:55:49.840 --> 00:55:54.560]   standing problem in the industry it's a it's it's something that it tends to impact smaller
[00:55:54.560 --> 00:55:58.520]   companies more than larger ones because it's very easy to be completely put out of business
[00:55:58.520 --> 00:56:01.920]   by a patent troll because they will they can just tie you up in lawsuits and you can't
[00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:03.480]   afford to fight them.
[00:56:03.480 --> 00:56:04.960]   Kevin if I can't get off.
[00:56:04.960 --> 00:56:05.960]   Sorry.
[00:56:05.960 --> 00:56:07.880]   I was gonna ask you a question.
[00:56:07.880 --> 00:56:08.880]   Keep going.
[00:56:08.880 --> 00:56:14.200]   So also you know when I was at Apple there was a steady stream of patent lawsuits against
[00:56:14.200 --> 00:56:19.520]   against Quay Time that was you know being fended off all the time by people who had
[00:56:19.520 --> 00:56:23.440]   patents on to some video this all video that and it's something that people are still very
[00:56:23.440 --> 00:56:29.320]   aware of so it is it's a thing that's been going on for a long time it's been growing.
[00:56:29.320 --> 00:56:35.440]   It may mean that you know companies will move to a place with a with a more favorable
[00:56:35.440 --> 00:56:39.640]   environment you know the EU does not have software patents to the same extent the US
[00:56:39.640 --> 00:56:45.800]   have they have a much tighter test for patentability which means that you can it's harder to get
[00:56:45.800 --> 00:56:49.720]   an injunction or a lawsuit going there and that may mean that it makes more sense for
[00:56:49.720 --> 00:56:54.160]   people to develop software there certainly I think Skype developing in Europe rather
[00:56:54.160 --> 00:56:59.520]   than America was was was was on that basis and possibly Spotify as well they they assumed
[00:56:59.520 --> 00:57:03.040]   that they could being based there would give them some insulation against this and they
[00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:07.560]   could then move to America once they had a established power base.
[00:57:07.560 --> 00:57:11.680]   Kevin if this is something you'd rather not talk about on the show kick me into the table
[00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:16.120]   but when you were kind enough to visit my office just yesterday here in New York you
[00:57:16.120 --> 00:57:20.920]   talked about a view of what you would say about patents going to the UK.
[00:57:20.920 --> 00:57:28.680]   Sure I think I certainly don't talk about so the original goal of the patent was to
[00:57:28.680 --> 00:57:32.880]   to publish trade secrets this is what patent law was invented to do it was to stop it
[00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:39.920]   we're using trade secrets and actually could be built on later and so there was a limited
[00:57:39.920 --> 00:57:43.560]   term for patents was it was explicitly on that basis and if you read the history of patent
[00:57:43.560 --> 00:57:48.640]   law in both the US and UK which the jurisdictions that decided first that's what it's idea
[00:57:48.640 --> 00:57:54.520]   was however we have a mechanism that's better than that now for sharing methods and secrets
[00:57:54.520 --> 00:57:59.400]   and that's published open source and published open standards these are places where people
[00:57:59.400 --> 00:58:05.160]   get to go and say okay here's my mechanism here's how I do it so I think that to rebalance
[00:58:05.160 --> 00:58:10.680]   this will be to give immunity to the you know if you like the GitHub infrastructure of software
[00:58:10.680 --> 00:58:14.880]   from patents because they are fulfilling the original goal of patents much more strongly
[00:58:14.880 --> 00:58:18.560]   and the conversely you could say okay if you want a patent software fine you've got to
[00:58:18.560 --> 00:58:23.720]   maintain a public source code repository for 20 years and then at the end of that 20 years
[00:58:23.720 --> 00:58:27.760]   people could use it that that may be a way to rebalance this it's certainly but the current
[00:58:27.760 --> 00:58:33.120]   situation is that patents are written to not make sense to engineers they're written to
[00:58:33.120 --> 00:58:37.560]   be written in the most broad and nonsensical language possible to that lawyers can then
[00:58:37.560 --> 00:58:43.800]   use them in the future to play say ha ha gotcha as opposed to you know open source software
[00:58:43.800 --> 00:58:46.600]   and inspects which are written the other way around because they're designed to be used
[00:58:46.600 --> 00:58:53.720]   interoperably so reversing that presumption would be would be a good thing I think I think
[00:58:53.720 --> 00:58:59.200]   that's a that is a really good idea the idea of sort of a an immunity or or something being
[00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:04.000]   granted I think it might be hard to get the big boys to buy off on it but if it could
[00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:09.360]   be done I think it'd be fantastic although to Gina's point if all the engineers go and
[00:59:09.360 --> 00:59:14.320]   work for the companies that do the IPA type agreement that that could put a little pressure
[00:59:14.320 --> 00:59:18.120]   on to either way I'm a big fan of IPA
[00:59:18.120 --> 00:59:25.960]   well this is part of the thing about open source is the open source is enormously attractive
[00:59:25.960 --> 00:59:30.320]   to engineers because it means that they know their code won't be won't just disappear into
[00:59:30.320 --> 00:59:34.520]   a black hole when the company changes direction or they their manager changes or they leave
[00:59:34.520 --> 00:59:38.280]   the company so if you know you're going to be able to work on open source at a company
[00:59:38.280 --> 00:59:41.360]   that that is that is still a very attractive way of hiring people and that's something
[00:59:41.360 --> 00:59:45.400]   that's that's true of Google and Facebook and Twitter and many of the companies that
[00:59:45.400 --> 00:59:49.720]   are supported by the source we've been seeing Microsoft getting into open source now with
[00:59:49.720 --> 00:59:53.720]   the with the open street map support things like that they're so conflicted about it
[00:59:53.720 --> 00:59:58.480]   but they're like in towards it they're like yes I guess we should set up a separate division
[00:59:58.480 --> 01:00:02.000]   that's supposed to be doing open source so they can try to fire water from windows and
[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:06.200]   it's not clear what they're doing that because the windows group is trying to squash it or
[01:00:06.200 --> 01:00:10.520]   they're doing that because they want to preserve the sort of patternless of the windows thing
[01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:15.640]   so there's but they're trying to make it work and I think part of that is it's much more
[01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:20.520]   attractive for the engineers who are you know coming of age in this culture to work on open
[01:00:20.520 --> 01:00:24.280]   source and you know the older engineers like me who've been through patent battles or who've
[01:00:24.280 --> 01:00:29.560]   been through having your entire software poured out from under you because your your project
[01:00:29.560 --> 01:00:35.160]   was cancelled or you you left the company it is very attractive to be able to make something
[01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:39.400]   that's open source and therefore transcend these institutions and the other half of it for the
[01:00:39.400 --> 01:00:45.080]   institutions point of view is that it means that if you're using an open source project and your
[01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:48.360]   engineers move somewhere else they're probably still going to maintain it you're not you don't
[01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:52.920]   actually you haven't actually lost the investment in that that that you had that you had because
[01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:58.600]   it was it was held behind the firewall so the balance of um the balance of power or the balance
[01:00:58.600 --> 01:01:06.120]   of ROI has has shifted quite a lot in the direction of open source of the last few years and that's
[01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:12.120]   you know that's becoming more visible you know more obvious to companies over time
[01:01:12.120 --> 01:01:16.280]   and I suspect that that maybe I'm I just said that maybe the only thing that makes this stuff
[01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:24.120]   more attractive yeah I know I I think taking that broad view and and saying look you know open source
[01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:28.920]   may have not conquered the desktop open source you know may have some setbacks along the way and
[01:01:28.920 --> 01:01:35.960]   we don't see big wins all the time but if you look at open source where it was in you know 1993
[01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:41.640]   around the birth of Linux and where it is now incredibly huge strides it is an essential piece
[01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:47.240]   good an optimistic point Tom yes yeah all right let's take a quick break we got a we got a Google
[01:01:47.240 --> 01:01:50.840]   drive rumor to get to we got to talk about the stock split but I want to thank our other spots
[01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:58.280]   are for this week in Google Ting I love this idea that they're doing at two cows two cows the folks
[01:01:58.280 --> 01:02:04.200]   who bring you hover.com have a new mobile service and this is brilliant it's about bringing billing
[01:02:04.200 --> 01:02:09.960]   clarity usability and big savings to mobile phone users so you only pay for what you use
[01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:15.000]   now it's built on the Sprint network which has a a good solid backbone so you get good coverage
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:20.600]   all over but they have a simple plan fair pricing you build by the megabyte the minute and the text
[01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:25.560]   message that's it here's the kick kicker right you're like oh great so so what do I have to be locked
[01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:32.600]   into if you use less than anticipated let's say you sign up for the 50 megabyte plan if you only
[01:02:32.600 --> 01:02:38.520]   use 20 megabytes you're automatically credited the difference at the end of the month if you use more
[01:02:38.520 --> 01:02:42.600]   you are billed for the additional amount but you're not locked into some new contract you're not
[01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:47.480]   given a punitive wow you went over the agreed contract amount they just pay you just should pay for the
[01:02:47.480 --> 01:02:54.040]   higher tier Ting.com has no premiums no penalties you just pay for what you use and they offer 4G
[01:02:54.040 --> 01:02:59.240]   Android phones through Sprint Ting website has clear graphic snapshots of usage by device so
[01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:04.200]   you can keep track of how close you are to a next tier if you're like I kind of need to stay under
[01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:09.000]   that that 500 megabyte tier you can do that that 500 minute tier you can do that lots of
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:14.760]   control over your features it's about putting you in charge of what you're paying for there's a
[01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:21.320]   there's a bunch of good tweets we've seen from people one from a customer back in February the phone
[01:03:21.320 --> 01:03:30.600]   bill was $22 last month that's almost exactly $100 less than AT&T. Wow and it's always about people
[01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:37.080]   saying wow now that I only pay for what I use I spend less money so don't wait you get great
[01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:40.760]   customer support if you use hover you already know about their great customer support two cast
[01:03:40.760 --> 01:03:46.200]   provides 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. eastern standard time email support also great offering an active
[01:03:46.200 --> 01:03:50.920]   discussion forum where you can talk to other folks you can you can get support by blog by tweet
[01:03:50.920 --> 01:03:56.600]   even post release notes it's a bunch of geeks run in a company the way you would want it to be run
[01:03:56.600 --> 01:04:00.120]   and the support folks are smart too they're passionate they're empowered they they know
[01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:03.800]   you don't have to sit there and go through a script with them they they understand that you know
[01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:09.080]   what you're talking about and they get to solving your problem so go try out their savings calculator
[01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:13.320]   if if this doesn't convince you enter your usage and the cost for the last few months
[01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:17.320]   ting will tell you how much you would have paid if you were using Ting and then you can go purchase
[01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:21.880]   a phone from ting right from the website the prices range from 104 to 545 bucks depending on what
[01:04:21.880 --> 01:04:25.320]   kind of phone you want but you're going to get it for cheaper than anyone else because you're going
[01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:33.160]   to get it by going to ting.com/twig and get 50 bucks off the purchase price of a device save money
[01:04:33.160 --> 01:04:40.120]   and better manage your mobile phone usage folks use ting that's ting.com/twig and we thank ting.com
[01:04:40.120 --> 01:04:46.200]   for their support of this week in google all right uh stock split real quick a bit of a financial
[01:04:46.200 --> 01:04:51.080]   story but the key thing here is not that if you're a stockholder you're going to now own two stocks
[01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:56.920]   for every one stock uh what it is is that the stock split is done so that google can issue a
[01:04:56.920 --> 01:05:04.360]   special new class of shares to current shareholders meaning that seargay and larry keep a firmer
[01:05:04.360 --> 01:05:10.200]   control firmer handle on the company jeff do you understand how this works i'm i i understand
[01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:15.480]   the principle but well i mean we see it a lot basically what it is is wasn't marx leckerberg
[01:05:15.480 --> 01:05:19.560]   smart but he still is going to go to ipo maintaining the control of his company
[01:05:19.560 --> 01:05:25.560]   and i suspect larry and seargay were jealous and so what they're doing is issuing a non voting
[01:05:25.560 --> 01:05:30.680]   share and so i'll get both you know i i am a google full disclosure google shareholder not much but i
[01:05:30.680 --> 01:05:35.960]   got a little bit and i will get uh voting share i'll get a non voting share and they will most
[01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:42.520]   the voting shares they already have control of the higher voting class uh very common uh the
[01:05:42.520 --> 01:05:47.880]   argument is that companies uh like i believe uh tribune company or or i think it was it was um
[01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:54.760]   uh night ritter did not have two class voting and thus they lost control lost control very easily
[01:05:54.760 --> 01:06:01.480]   and they were subject to um what they would consider financial trolls to come in and
[01:06:01.480 --> 01:06:07.480]   shake control the company the argument that i've seen basically and and uh and eros sorcan make
[01:06:07.480 --> 01:06:12.680]   this in the new york times is that as long as we think that larry and seargay and eric are smart
[01:06:12.680 --> 01:06:17.800]   and doing good things well then hucky dory but come the moment when google goes south when they
[01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:24.520]   leave when they hire the equivalent of mr pepsy um you know what happens the the shareholders have
[01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:30.200]   no control it's uh is in the next question obvious question always ask as soon as as soon as you know
[01:06:30.200 --> 01:06:36.760]   if if if they eat a non-union tomato is that evil um that's what we're going to be asked now is
[01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:43.560]   is this evil to do uh as much as wall street is it's it's what wall street does it's what companies
[01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:48.040]   do to maintain control of the companies having lost control of my magazine and i don't even
[01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:52.440]   weekly i get that you try to do the things that set you up in the future to maintain control of your
[01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:55.960]   baby and you do the best you can use the tools available that's what they did
[01:06:57.560 --> 01:07:02.760]   yeah i got nothing to add to that jina what about you yeah i mean seems reasonable seems like you
[01:07:02.760 --> 01:07:09.400]   know it makes sense it i wasn't outraged or or anything i accept page and brin as the
[01:07:09.400 --> 01:07:15.160]   as having the most control your new masterlords yes yes exactly i suppose long long term
[01:07:15.160 --> 01:07:20.600]   it were it may be worrisome uh because of you know what you said about page and brin not lasting
[01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:27.160]   forever or moving on or or whatever uh but in the short term i i am a big fan of if someone is
[01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:31.720]   competent and good at what they do they should stay in charge of it and we too often move people
[01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:36.360]   in and out i mean look at yahoo i you could you can argue that jerry yang is not the right guy to
[01:07:36.360 --> 01:07:42.360]   lead that that ship for sure but the constant swap of ceo and every ceo coming in and saying i've
[01:07:42.360 --> 01:07:47.320]   got a new plan it's very similar to the old plan but that's a little bit different that didn't get
[01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:51.960]   fully caused by i mean the most recent one did get a bit of caused by the shareholders that got
[01:07:51.960 --> 01:07:56.120]   caused by not having any freaking plans and so i actually think it's that's you're making a good
[01:07:56.120 --> 01:08:01.960]   point but almost in reverse in the sense that what if jerry yang's authority over yahoo had been
[01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:07.720]   concrete would they be even worse off now well and that's that's possible right uh you could you
[01:08:07.720 --> 01:08:13.080]   could make that argument amazingly but my point is once you lose the founder whether they're good or
[01:08:13.080 --> 01:08:19.480]   bad you're into this sort of rotato of people who they're not really care about the company they're
[01:08:19.480 --> 01:08:24.520]   a hired gun and maybe they're good maybe they're not but they don't i get the feeling that most of
[01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:29.320]   the problems caused in these situations and because the ceo doesn't really care about the business
[01:08:29.320 --> 01:08:34.120]   and doesn't really understand the best strategy is to have a strategy number one and to execute
[01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:38.440]   it well number two it is as always at moments like this who's the best example of that steve jobs
[01:08:38.440 --> 01:08:43.000]   he did lose control of his company the company needed him back he did so well stock structure
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:47.320]   didn't matter we're buying a stock like crazy with most valuable company in the world we love him
[01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:54.440]   because he had a strategy well executed all right let's let's go to a fun rumor we haven't
[01:08:54.440 --> 01:09:00.200]   had a fun rumor this has all been fact uh are we gonna get google drive next week
[01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:04.840]   it looks like there's uh some good leaks from the next web they say they've got sources they've
[01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:11.000]   seen documentation uh and it's gonna launch next week with a five gigabyte for free plan and then
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:16.760]   you pay to add to it you know what's your odds i don't know this is a tough one i feel like we've
[01:09:16.760 --> 01:09:23.720]   been hearing this for a long time this one sounds maybe a little more authentic maybe just because
[01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:29.560]   i want it yeah that's what i think we're gonna see it i think we're gonna see it i don't know if
[01:09:29.560 --> 01:09:32.920]   it's gonna be next week because literally how many times have we seen this story over the past
[01:09:32.920 --> 01:09:38.600]   three years that google drive this you know here's my question jina will it be the real question to
[01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:43.720]   me is will it be better than dropbox yeah that is the question i mean dropbox is definitely the
[01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:49.400]   leader in terms of user experience in this in this in this area so um it sounds like from the
[01:09:49.400 --> 01:09:54.120]   rumored specs that it's gonna be very similar to to dropbox only that it's gonna offer more space
[01:09:54.120 --> 01:10:00.440]   yeah um they say it will integrate with mac and pc again they being the sources the unnamed sources
[01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:06.120]   as folders as regular files and folders just the way dropbox does which is which is really what's
[01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:10.280]   so great about dropbox i mean it just sort of sinks in the end you're not uploading you know it
[01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:14.840]   doesn't feel like you're uploading or downloading anything it just happens well add in advantages
[01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:19.480]   then does google have over dropbox if if if there are parity in terms of that basic functionality
[01:10:19.480 --> 01:10:24.680]   besides brand but i mean in terms of functionally does the fact that google loans the rest of our
[01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:29.000]   lives bring it great advantage or not really well it means that they can integrate um
[01:10:29.000 --> 01:10:35.240]   results from your personal g drive and yours in your google search results right so it means that
[01:10:35.240 --> 01:10:38.920]   you know when you have your phone you know out with you you've got access i mean the dropbox is a
[01:10:38.920 --> 01:10:43.080]   great a dropbox and a bunch of other products would do some similar things to dropbox but i think
[01:10:43.080 --> 01:10:48.360]   dropbox is the leader okay so now i predict sorry oh no i was gonna say like you can have your files
[01:10:48.360 --> 01:10:54.120]   anywhere but with google they'll be integrated with the rest of google's uh products potentially so
[01:10:54.120 --> 01:10:59.880]   i give it three weeks before the wall street journal does a panic google knows what's in your
[01:10:59.880 --> 01:11:05.880]   files oh god yeah three three weeks seems long i mean the truth is that google has a lot of it
[01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:10.680]   you can upload files to google docs and store them there now um i mean i think you know the thing about
[01:11:10.680 --> 01:11:15.960]   google drive is that it'll do this auto-syncing it'll be baked in your operating system and it
[01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:21.480]   sounds like it could do things similar to what google desktop used to be that the old much missed
[01:11:21.480 --> 01:11:26.440]   oh maybe not much missed google desktop where you could do searches and it would inject uh
[01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:32.520]   results from your local file system into your your google search results uh kevin do you have a
[01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:37.240]   a sense of whether this google drive rumor is the real google drive rumor are we going to see
[01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:44.200]   google drive next week who knows um it's possible i mean the other thing that they put out today that
[01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:49.000]   was that was interesting was um google cloud print we're now sent to android and if you saw that
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:54.360]   yeah i did that and federal express into federal express as well which is which is also interesting
[01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:59.000]   so i think that that that may fit in with this as well that that means you know that's that's
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:04.520]   more of a sort of document routing system but um it seems an obvious thing to route it to google docs
[01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:09.400]   too that you know that's what happens when you emo get emo to pdf that you click on it and send
[01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:14.040]   it to google docs right away so that fitting that together a bit more would would make sense to
[01:12:14.040 --> 01:12:21.800]   as a real point i think um it's to some extent some of the drive stuff is a bit odd um there's
[01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:27.720]   because particularly on mobile because actually using a file system on a mobile phone is often
[01:12:27.720 --> 01:12:31.320]   fairly painful and it's certainly something apples resisted really hard on the iPhone
[01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:37.160]   to the point where they basically handed it over to third parties to go something that does that
[01:12:37.160 --> 01:12:42.440]   for them which is which is kind of weird um i'm sort of expecting to do a bit you know i expect
[01:12:42.440 --> 01:12:48.120]   them to do something a bit better around that too yeah i would like to see better file management
[01:12:48.120 --> 01:12:52.840]   it doesn't have to be folders even necessarily i i don't care if somebody comes up with a better
[01:12:52.840 --> 01:12:58.360]   metaphor but i want to see better file management that'd be fun well the thing is that they've
[01:12:58.360 --> 01:13:03.320]   been doing on the rest of it right they've they've built um edit history into the operating system
[01:13:03.320 --> 01:13:07.560]   now so they're you know the the way i was talking about of these sort of the the get
[01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:11.560]   helpization of everything um both say wave kevin don't use the word wave
[01:13:11.560 --> 01:13:17.880]   the wave did it wave did it too wave was an example of this the the point is that um it used to
[01:13:17.880 --> 01:13:25.080]   be that storage was expensive um and and slow and so you had a copy of your document in memory
[01:13:25.080 --> 01:13:28.440]   and then you would you would be asked every time you would just save it out to disc because you
[01:13:28.440 --> 01:13:33.160]   didn't want to fill the disc up um and that that paradigm is is so out of date now it's it's kind
[01:13:33.160 --> 01:13:37.080]   of you know embarrassing to try and explain to somebody what that little floppy disc icon is
[01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:42.520]   in microsoft word when they when they're sort of less than 20 years old so the the fact that
[01:13:42.520 --> 01:13:48.200]   you know what's that it's a floppy disc oh yeah it's like the cd icon in iTunes too now it's
[01:13:48.200 --> 01:13:54.120]   going the same way right but yeah that's just yeah more recent thing you should have those around
[01:13:54.120 --> 01:14:00.200]   the house i've got yeah i might have a few in the garage somewhere um but the the sort of the world
[01:14:00.200 --> 01:14:06.760]   view of you have to load and save is is is being gradually eroded um google docs you know
[01:14:06.760 --> 01:14:10.920]   and did up sort of having to put it back because people were looking for it that was sort of weird
[01:14:10.920 --> 01:14:16.120]   user testing thing but um by default they didn't do that um apple is now changed the operating
[01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:22.680]   system with um mountain lions such that by default it doesn't have save and save as it has
[01:14:22.680 --> 01:14:27.320]   some sense of going back through edit histories there so they're they're getting that piece um
[01:14:27.320 --> 01:14:31.720]   we've had it as programmers with source control control for a long time but but sort of the
[01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:36.200]   get-how work we take set a bit further with the presumption that the first thing you do is
[01:14:36.200 --> 01:14:39.560]   clone it into your own repository and then you start forking it and then you can eventually
[01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:43.240]   merge stuff back later but there is an assumption that everything is happening in parallel
[01:14:43.240 --> 01:14:47.800]   wikipedia has sort of put this into the pub rich consciousness by having publicly visible edit
[01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:53.960]   histories and be able to go back and forths in time so that paradigm of storage is not a problem
[01:14:53.960 --> 01:14:58.600]   we should keep every version of everything ever um is is is moving through and that would be
[01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:05.240]   something that you want on mobile too and that that's one of those issues of of which have i got on
[01:15:05.240 --> 01:15:09.880]   the on the phone and which i've got in the cloud is the thing that makes it tricky but it's it's
[01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:13.800]   something that we want and i think there will be a battle a battle between apple and google
[01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:18.920]   about how you present that to use it in a coherent way yeah and they'll be so what you're saying too
[01:15:18.920 --> 01:15:23.400]   is that we won't just save the current version they'll be saving your history i would assume that
[01:15:23.400 --> 01:15:28.040]   with it yeah that's the natural thing to do yeah yeah yeah right everything's moving in that direction
[01:15:28.040 --> 01:15:35.400]   yep got it even it's sort of even to the point of um sort of system design the the sort of the
[01:15:35.400 --> 01:15:40.840]   growth of functional programming is all about um not having contention over a single copy of things
[01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:47.240]   but having paths through data that that are um modifying things in their own in their own version
[01:15:47.240 --> 01:15:53.960]   of the world if you like if you think about the difference between um the sort of the way the way
[01:15:53.960 --> 01:16:00.040]   javascript handles stuff and the way java handles stuff um java still have the very much
[01:16:00.040 --> 01:16:04.440]   data structure being passed around world world view um javascript has closures that are passed
[01:16:04.440 --> 01:16:10.040]   around the containing the entire state of the current machine at the time of that event and
[01:16:10.040 --> 01:16:13.960]   then they're held as you go off and do something else and come back which is one of the reasons
[01:16:13.960 --> 01:16:18.200]   that you know not to rave too much about no jessica but one of the reasons that the node feels so
[01:16:18.200 --> 01:16:23.240]   nice when you're writing web programming is that it has the same feel that a um that you that you
[01:16:23.240 --> 01:16:26.760]   get client side with you will do something and call something and then when it comes back you do
[01:16:26.760 --> 01:16:30.600]   something else and you end up writing the service i stuff in the same way which means it's naturally
[01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:35.160]   paralysed but it's easy to spin up more machines for it because it's because you've written stuff
[01:16:35.160 --> 01:16:43.000]   with the presumption that um each each instance of it is wholly independent um and not everything
[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:47.080]   can be written that way and the core of node is in c because it has to you know deal with that kind
[01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:52.280]   of routing but that does the spread of that world view is is also really interesting and there's
[01:16:52.280 --> 01:16:56.600]   also the other potential there about the contention between client and server starts getting interested
[01:16:56.600 --> 01:17:00.520]   because if you're running if you're writing the same code in the same language to run on the client
[01:17:00.520 --> 01:17:05.160]   and the server and you can decide to migrate bits back and forth much more easily without having to
[01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:09.960]   spend so much time deciding which is which and worrying about the boundaries of the world and
[01:17:09.960 --> 01:17:15.080]   the different shape of the data structures so if you're creating a JSON object on the server
[01:17:15.080 --> 01:17:19.960]   and passing it to the client um you can decide whether you do that or not at which point you render it
[01:17:19.960 --> 01:17:25.720]   which point you don't so there's that sort of fluidity i think is going to become more important
[01:17:25.720 --> 01:17:30.440]   over time and that's that we sort of we're seeing the beginnings of that in various directions as
[01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:35.960]   as program as world views worldview change and i think that that permeates out to the world as
[01:17:35.960 --> 01:17:41.320]   as programmers we make those those ideas available to the public and then it frees us up from worrying
[01:17:41.320 --> 01:17:48.360]   about where our data is stored to be honest um it can help for that yes exactly yeah it gets us
[01:17:48.360 --> 01:17:53.240]   down that road to that mesh couple of things uh we want to finish up with uh here first of all fcc
[01:17:53.240 --> 01:17:58.360]   has cleared google over the wi-fi eavesdropping from the google street view they're not going to pay
[01:17:58.360 --> 01:18:04.920]   anything for that but they are going to pay 25 000 dollars for being uncooperative in fact the
[01:18:04.920 --> 01:18:09.960]   fcc said they seem to be the world leader in search unless they're searching for an email that we
[01:18:09.960 --> 01:18:16.280]   want from them it's not an exact quote but they seem to be pretty close to that and meanwhile though
[01:18:16.280 --> 01:18:20.760]   this thing will not die now at the same time we think we're finally getting toward the end of it
[01:18:20.760 --> 01:18:26.520]   edmar key and congress comes out demanding a new investigation of the same bogus thing you know
[01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:33.160]   congressman our countries in a mess people don't have health care they don't have mortgages we're
[01:18:33.160 --> 01:18:40.680]   losing our homes europe has fallen along yeah a little snippet of my s s i d in a piece of data
[01:18:40.680 --> 01:18:45.480]   the google wants to delete but you won't let them it's not that's not my biggest part of this one
[01:18:45.480 --> 01:18:51.400]   yeah so also eileen was very insistent that we talk about the two pock hologram
[01:18:51.400 --> 01:18:57.720]   that was a coachella this weekend it's uh it was what was called a peppers ghost
[01:18:57.720 --> 01:19:03.240]   which is a rear projection that makes it look like it's in three dimensions pretty difficult to do
[01:19:03.240 --> 01:19:08.120]   especially in those live circumstances like that but what impressed me was the fact that they had
[01:19:08.120 --> 01:19:12.520]   a full performance referring to snoop dog and dr dray who are on the on the stage with them
[01:19:12.520 --> 01:19:19.880]   saying hey coachella uh just very in context uh from somebody who's has been dead for several years
[01:19:19.880 --> 01:19:26.200]   an impressive bit of CGI if nothing else definitely i was really impressed at how good it looks i've
[01:19:26.200 --> 01:19:30.440]   been hearing about it but i didn't i didn't watch the video until just before the show and i was
[01:19:30.440 --> 01:19:34.840]   like oh wow i was kind of went you know i listened to tnt yesterday and i think sarah said that she
[01:19:34.840 --> 01:19:39.160]   just thinks it's weird and i agree with her but then you said but it's such a great technology and i
[01:19:39.160 --> 01:19:43.800]   went from sarah to tom when i saw the video like this is amazing technology it looks really good
[01:19:43.800 --> 01:19:47.640]   yeah i don't disagree with sarah on the weirdness although we had a caller who explained that you
[01:19:47.640 --> 01:19:51.320]   know they talked to the family and made sure that the family was okay and the family was actually
[01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:55.960]   cool with it they thought it was a good memorial etc still kind of weird but just the if you forget
[01:19:55.960 --> 01:20:02.520]   about that just the ability to actually create someone i mean i know i don't know what other
[01:20:02.520 --> 01:20:07.080]   applications you can have with this but it just yeah you know as we've gone from putting somebody in
[01:20:07.080 --> 01:20:13.320]   forest gump uh in a scene that already existed to having actors in famous movies say other lines
[01:20:13.320 --> 01:20:18.360]   in a direct tv commercial than the lines they actually said uh to this i mean we're not that far
[01:20:18.360 --> 01:20:24.120]   down the road from just being able to create performances out of nothing i want the jina
[01:20:24.120 --> 01:20:31.240]   hologram next to me to fix my problems and technology today the jina gram the jina gram
[01:20:32.920 --> 01:20:38.600]   i don't know i don't know if you want that you might the leo gram i think i want my very own jina
[01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:43.720]   right next to me there's a brilliant novel by connie willis that was written about 20 years ago
[01:20:43.720 --> 01:20:49.240]   that talks about what will happen when this is possible and the future of of movies when you can
[01:20:49.240 --> 01:20:55.240]   recreate people from archival material called remake i really recommend that if you if you want to sort
[01:20:55.240 --> 01:20:59.240]   of find someone who's thought this through once already that's by connie willis as did you say
[01:20:59.880 --> 01:21:04.840]   connie willis yes remake i have to check that probably probably all your fuel if you're
[01:21:04.840 --> 01:21:07.560]   smart you should option it the film rights of it now because it's actually possible
[01:21:07.560 --> 01:21:13.720]   so but yeah no this is i mean this is something that's people have been able to do to some
[01:21:13.720 --> 01:21:19.560]   extent for a while if you actually think about many you know serious hollywood pictures they have
[01:21:19.560 --> 01:21:26.200]   chunks of this going on where they're either repainting the the leads over the stuntmen or
[01:21:26.200 --> 01:21:31.480]   they're you know creating characters from whole cloth like golem but there hasn't been as much of
[01:21:31.480 --> 01:21:37.560]   this sort of you know rebuild rebuild an existing person from there from their pre-existing footage
[01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:41.240]   stuff there's been bits of it with there were adverts that had fred a stare and things like that
[01:21:41.240 --> 01:21:46.600]   yeah yeah but to actually turn them into a full puppet that somebody can perform or that you know
[01:21:46.600 --> 01:21:52.760]   somebody can render is is a tougher problem and yeah that's you know technology catches up with
[01:21:52.760 --> 01:21:57.320]   that there's this there's a there's a bit of uncanny value to it but it's it's getting
[01:21:57.320 --> 01:22:03.240]   closer to being convincing definitely let's finish up with our picks uh and uh kevin let me
[01:22:03.240 --> 01:22:07.160]   know if you if you've got one and i'll get to you in a second but we'll start off with jina i think
[01:22:07.160 --> 01:22:11.160]   we may have stepped on yours a little bit that's it yeah kevin kevin mentioned it earlier this is
[01:22:11.160 --> 01:22:18.200]   really cool cool new thing in chrome google cloud print now supports um ice cream sandwich and
[01:22:18.200 --> 01:22:24.360]   android devices and can print to your local fedex office so if you're at a coffee shop or you're
[01:22:24.360 --> 01:22:29.080]   ever when a garden like kevin usually is or you're just in a hotel or wherever and you want to print
[01:22:29.080 --> 01:22:33.880]   something in chrome from the print dialogue you can choose google cloud print from the printer
[01:22:33.880 --> 01:22:39.480]   drop down and in the latest version of chrome it offers it will show you your ice cream sandwich
[01:22:39.480 --> 01:22:45.640]   devices and you can say print to my local fedex office and then uh you can go pick up your print
[01:22:45.640 --> 01:22:50.280]   out there so uh neat new new feature in google cloud print you know some people may say well
[01:22:50.280 --> 01:22:56.520]   why would i want to print to the fedex office but i had a big hefty legal thing that i had to go
[01:22:56.520 --> 01:23:02.200]   and make a copy of at the fedex office uh because it was so huge i wasn't gonna do it on my little
[01:23:02.200 --> 01:23:09.160]   epson at home right so i uh so i i had to take it down with the file and then give him the file and
[01:23:09.160 --> 01:23:14.360]   you know this would have been so much better i would have just emailed it or printed it and then
[01:23:14.360 --> 01:23:18.840]   gone and picked it up absolutely for anything that long documents that you want a nice print
[01:23:18.840 --> 01:23:23.160]   out at and you don't want to use you know your home your home your home ink it's great absolutely
[01:23:23.160 --> 01:23:28.360]   i hope you were turning into a patent role wasn't a patent suit it was well i've got a patent for
[01:23:28.360 --> 01:23:35.400]   uh displaying excellent journalism uh printouts behind me in a v a method in apparatus for doing
[01:23:35.400 --> 01:23:42.280]   that in a video stream you'll be hearing from my lawyer but in the meantime what's your number
[01:23:42.280 --> 01:23:46.760]   jeff well uh this one is not my number and part of me for looking away folks but because i'm
[01:23:46.760 --> 01:23:51.240]   staff too is she's against the first number is one the year of my life i lost and we're fighting
[01:23:51.240 --> 01:23:56.280]   with with bandwidth today um the second not my number is brityard britainson i don't know if this
[01:23:56.280 --> 01:24:02.200]   is new or not but brityard brityard britainson invested in an expound and path uh with uh red
[01:24:02.200 --> 01:24:09.320]   point graylock uh Kleiner Perkins index mark pincus yori milliner alan company uh this is what
[01:24:09.320 --> 01:24:14.760]   instagram hath rot uh but the real number of the week uh a nice little accenture survey
[01:24:14.760 --> 01:24:21.960]   that found that uh i found this fascinating 64 percent of us customers recall seeing social
[01:24:21.960 --> 01:24:28.040]   media icons while watching tv in other words when the weatherman says you can find me on twitter and
[01:24:28.040 --> 01:24:32.520]   a third of them have interacted with the social service after seeing the symbol on the screen
[01:24:32.520 --> 01:24:38.680]   how important is that to future views of what advertising means and the connection that it creates
[01:24:38.680 --> 01:24:43.560]   for facebook etc said of course led the way 42 percent say they had noticed a facebook like
[01:24:43.560 --> 01:24:48.680]   symbol while watching a tv show and knew how to interact with it 20 percent they ended up
[01:24:48.680 --> 01:24:53.320]   said they ended up liking the tv program while watching some other quick numbers 43 percent
[01:24:53.320 --> 01:24:56.760]   said obtain more information about a show product or service they use social media
[01:24:56.760 --> 01:25:03.080]   um 30 for 3 2 percent said it used it to get social coupons 31 percent intercostis and so on
[01:25:03.080 --> 01:25:07.960]   and so on and so on it just it just really emphasizes that if you wonder why facebook is going to be
[01:25:07.960 --> 01:25:12.760]   worth what it's going to be worth when the ipo hits that they've not even begun to plumb and
[01:25:12.760 --> 01:25:20.120]   mine yet this is the kind of stuff it is that that the the direct connection that social creates
[01:25:20.120 --> 01:25:28.200]   between a brand and its customer uh replaces advertising cost and supplants advertising
[01:25:28.200 --> 01:25:32.520]   functionality is better than a message is truly a relationship it's something that brands are
[01:25:32.520 --> 01:25:37.800]   starting to learn the media have not yet learned apart from the likes of lio loport et al and so
[01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:43.080]   that's my numbers of the week all right thank you for that my tool is an extension i don't think
[01:25:43.080 --> 01:25:48.360]   has been covered on twig that when i went from chrome recently and switched to firefox for a
[01:25:48.360 --> 01:25:53.080]   while and then i had to go back uh to chrome one of the things i missed from firefox is when i
[01:25:53.080 --> 01:25:57.160]   click on a tab it opens all the way to the right in chrome the default is to have it open right
[01:25:57.160 --> 01:26:04.360]   next to the tab you're in tabs plus is an extension on chrome not tabs mix plus but tabs plus allows
[01:26:04.360 --> 01:26:09.640]   you to customize lots of different tab behaviors choose where the focus will be after closing a tab
[01:26:09.640 --> 01:26:13.800]   choose the default behavior for a new tab you can pin current tabs so they won't be used for the
[01:26:13.800 --> 01:26:19.160]   last selected behavior lots of cool stuff the biggest thing i do is i have it changed that my
[01:26:19.160 --> 01:26:24.280]   tabs open as last in the in the row so they always open all the way to the right because that's just
[01:26:24.280 --> 01:26:29.720]   the way i like it but uh check it out tabs plus it's a good chrome extension uh that i use
[01:26:30.280 --> 01:26:35.800]   every day it's a little bit wonky at first because what it does is uh is it opens the tab
[01:26:35.800 --> 01:26:41.560]   and then moves it so you'll see it open next to your tab and then move over here i'll uh
[01:26:41.560 --> 01:26:46.760]   i'll go i'll go do it check this out you open the tab wait real quick you see it and then it
[01:26:46.760 --> 01:26:50.600]   pretty quick and then it shoves it over there but i got used to it so it's so it's fine uh and it
[01:26:50.600 --> 01:26:56.840]   works for me so tabs plus check it out in the chrome web store i'm gonna finish up kevin you've
[01:26:56.840 --> 01:27:04.840]   got a tip as well more of a call to action really um the uk government is putting out a
[01:27:04.840 --> 01:27:10.280]   consultation on open standards um and they're accepting submissions from individuals as well
[01:27:10.280 --> 01:27:17.000]   as companies so um so far my understanding is they've had a lot of submissions from large ip lawyers
[01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:22.120]   saying that patterns are a wonderful thing um from those standards it would be great if we could
[01:27:22.120 --> 01:27:27.000]   send them some submissions that were more along the lines of patterns so creating a terrible
[01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:32.680]   problem for the internet so that's that's something i wanted to share with people here in case that
[01:27:32.680 --> 01:27:38.200]   they you know knowing how big this audience is so you can find that i'm just the euro is a bit long
[01:27:38.200 --> 01:27:43.720]   but it's consultation.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/openstandards
[01:27:43.720 --> 01:27:51.640]   and they it will be you'll be good to um you know send send they have got a series of questions
[01:27:51.640 --> 01:27:55.800]   they're asking um so if you can give them a sort of well-reasoned response to the points
[01:27:55.800 --> 01:28:00.040]   pointing to evidence that would be useful um just in in getting them to think about this and
[01:28:00.040 --> 01:28:05.320]   in a similar way to getting you know that the u.s congress to rethink patterns will be good too.
[01:28:05.320 --> 01:28:09.960]   yeah absolutely no great stuff thank you uh kevin and thanks everybody for watching or listening

[01:29:36.680 --> 01:29:40.840]   people to dance with each other at weddings and make the the party actually happen and we think
[01:29:40.840 --> 01:29:45.000]   that's the skill set that's really important for the social media so that's that's that's what
