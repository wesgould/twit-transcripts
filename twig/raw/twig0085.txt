[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.880]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:05.920]   Netcast you love.
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:07.280]   From people you trust.
[00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.120]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.840]   This is Twig.
[00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.600]   Bandwidth for this week in Google is provided by cash fly,
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.920]   C-A-C-H-E-F-L-Y dot com.
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.160]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.600]   This is Twig.
[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:31.240]   This week in Google, episode 85 recorded March 9, 2011.
[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.120]   That's so scoggy.
[00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.280]   This week at Google is brought to you by hover.com.
[00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.560]   Hover is domain name, registration, and management.
[00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:40.400]   That's simple.
[00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:47.920]   For 10% off your new domain, go to twig.hover.com.
[00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.000]   It's time for Twig this week in Google and the cloud.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.800]   We cover Facebook and Twitter as well as Google.
[00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.720]   We just call it Twig because then people
[00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:57.920]   know what they're going to get.
[00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.640]   And Google's such a good brand name.
[00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.880]   And if we did this, we could Facebook, it'd be Twiff.
[00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.440]   And nobody would say that.
[00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.560]   Joining us right now from San Diego, California,
[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.440]   and her home, Gina Trapani, or her office,
[00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:09.440]   I'm not sure which.
[00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:10.040]   Hi, Gina.
[00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.920]   I heard from her bicycle lab.
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:12.920]   From my bicycle lab.
[00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:13.640]   Exactly.
[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:14.240]   How's it going?
[00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.760]   Going great.
[00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.640]   Somebody just told me, Glee's been back for three weeks,
[00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:17.960]   and I didn't even know.
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:18.480]   What?
[00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.480]   No, there was a new episode last night.
[00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.160]   But the week before that, there wasn't one.
[00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.960]   Oh, but I think I didn't know that they restarted.
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.800]   So I think I have at least a couple.
[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.840]   Yeah, and you've got a Gwyneth episode to watch.
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:29.920]   So that's very exciting.
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.560]   This week in Glee, I'm sorry.
[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.120]   I did I say it was this week in Google?
[00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.440]   It's this week in Glee.
[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.960]   Of course.
[00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:38.440]   Of course.
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:39.800]   Jeff Jarvis is also here.
[00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.840]   Manny's sharp looking today.
[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:44.560]   Look at that.
[00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:45.240]   You look like--
[00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.200]   Of course, Gary.
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.880]   And then you take her.
[00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:47.720]   But you're going to interview--
[00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:48.480]   Hey, hey, hey.
[00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:51.800]   You're going to interview the fashion forward.
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.080]   There's a Meyer in a band now.
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.560]   I had my product tie on.
[00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:57.600]   Ah.
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.000]   I'm sorry, I'm not in New York for that.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.960]   Barney's warehouse sale cheap.
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.840]   And Tim Armstrong together on the same stage?
[00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:06.680]   Yep.
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:07.840]   Wow.
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.160]   Tim Armstrong, CEO of-- the new CEO of AOL.
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.720]   We get to talk about great things like the AOL way
[00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.520]   and Ariana's way and quality and content and fun stuff.
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.120]   Can people watch this event?
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.960]   Yes, they can.
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.800]   I gave you the URL.
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.560]   Now I've got to figure out where the heck--
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.440]   I have it here somewhere.
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.720]   This is the inauguration of your new TOW--
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:34.200]   What's it called?
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.000]   TOW Night Center.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.120]   TOW Night Media.
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:42.160]   So if you go to dubs.journalism.cuny.edu/live--
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.240]   again, journalism.cuny.edu/live.
[00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.240]   Good.
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.920]   Nice.
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:47.600]   You can watch.
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:48.680]   This is the inauguration.
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.800]   That's 7-E-T.
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:51.840]   Yeah.
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.320]   This is the inauguration of the Center
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.720]   for Entrepreneurial Journalism.
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.240]   Not Adoxy Moron, damn it.
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:59.920]   What is it?
[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.760]   It's journalists making their own jobs
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.560]   and making journalism sustainable.
[00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.240]   And--
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.320]   Oh, you mean like twin?
[00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:06.320]   --twillists.
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.760]   Yeah.
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:07.320]   Exactly.
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.880]   Like what you do, Liam.
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.320]   Oh, you're like this.
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.400]   In fact, that reminds me of, I've
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.520]   got to have you talk to the class.
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:13.320]   I'd love to.
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.040]   In your copious free time, we'll get you on site.
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:17.320]   So you do a class on entrepreneurial journalism.
[00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.680]   We now have a whole certificate program where we have students
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.640]   here that are full time for a semester just on this topic.
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.120]   I bet you there are a number of working journalists who
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:27.320]   want to go to this and--
[00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:28.240]   That's what we have now.
[00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:29.600]   We have returning professionals.
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:30.760]   Read unemployed.
[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:31.800]   Yeah.
[00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:37.320]   And so we have 11 students from all over of Sri Lanka, Denmark,
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.560]   Rwanda, and Brooklyn.
[00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.400]   I remember when I talked a couple of years ago
[00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.840]   to the Online News Association, how interested--
[00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.160]   currently working-- sometimes really big name currently--
[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.320]   working jobs were in this subject because, A, people
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.040]   feel like newspapers are failing, and B,
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.200]   because they want to control their own stuff.
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.120]   That's what started me.
[00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.760]   It wasn't a lack of work.
[00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:00.120]   It was--
[00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.560]   I wanted to--
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:01.160]   --break quite hopefully.
[00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:02.760]   I wanted to control it.
[00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:03.240]   Yeah.
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.400]   And especially in our beat because, frankly, we
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.800]   are so geeky and nerdy that no mainstream media
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.960]   at Christ wants anything to do with the kind of content
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.400]   that we do here.
[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.800]   Speaking of which, let's talk about HTML5.
[00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.080]   Also joining us, Seth Ladd.
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:20.680]   He is a developer advocate at Google.
[00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.680]   And Gina, why don't you introduce Seth
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.840]   since you were the one who discovered him?
[00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.520]   I get discovery-- the discovery fee.
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.520]   Seth did a great tech talk at an event here in San Diego
[00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.480]   called Refresh about Chrome and HTML5.
[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:36.760]   And it was a great presentation.
[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.400]   And like I said, I ambushed him right afterwards
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.560]   and recruited him to be on twig so that we could--
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:42.200]   but he'd ask him questions about Chrome.
[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:43.800]   And actually, this is perfect timing
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:47.280]   because Chrome 10 dropped today.
[00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:49.840]   So I thought maybe Seth could tell us a little bit about--
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:50.840]   I use Chrome.
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:51.400]   I love it.
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:52.920]   And one of the things I love about it
[00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:55.800]   is that it just sort of updates without me having to do much.
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.960]   It just tells me, hey, you should--
[00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.640]   you haven't restarted in a while.
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.040]   If you do, you'll get an update.
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.880]   I love that.
[00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.080]   I don't even think about it, which I love, which I love.
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:06.320]   But maybe Seth, you can tell us a little bit about the Chrome
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:07.520]   10 release.
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:08.120]   Yeah, sure.
[00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:09.800]   So the auto-updating feature--
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.160]   I mean, it's a browser for the web.
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.400]   And the web doesn't have long-standing releases.
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.680]   Any time you just save a new page to the web,
[00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.200]   it's automatically available to everyone.
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:22.240]   We wanted to take that model of essentially instantaneous
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.760]   distribution all the way down even to Chrome.
[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:27.440]   So we're going to try to keep pushing this as fast and fast
[00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:30.080]   as we can get and just essentially eliminate the version
[00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:30.440]   numbers.
[00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:32.400]   And if we can do that, that's just fantastic.
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.880]   Version numbers are not a human thing.
[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:35.760]   Any more than you are.
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.560]   Ls are a human thing.
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.160]   Exactly, especially with Chrome, right?
[00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.240]   Because we update all the time.
[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.840]   It's beginning to lose meaning.
[00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.400]   And we just really like that because it just
[00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.400]   gets the latest and greatest to end users.
[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.080]   Like you said, without even thinking about it,
[00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:48.800]   you're just restarting.
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.400]   It's just magically there.
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:50.920]   Yeah.
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:52.800]   Yeah, I had to go into Chrome's about box
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.120]   to see if I had the latest version.
[00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:54.840]   And I did.
[00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.120]   And I hadn't done anything to get it.
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.600]   I just said, oh, look, Chrome 10 got released.
[00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.720]   And it seems like every Chrome release is much faster.
[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:04.720]   Seems to be one of the marquee features.
[00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:05.480]   Well, definitely.
[00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:08.560]   With Chrome, our mantra is speed, stability, and security.
[00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.480]   And so especially with Chrome 10, we're
[00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:14.680]   pushing out Crank Chef, which is our next iteration
[00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.720]   with the V8 JavaScript engine.
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.120]   So see some really significant speed improvements.
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:22.400]   So yeah, I hope to continue that trend.
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:24.040]   Chrome is based on WebKit.
[00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.800]   How much of this is WebKit getting updated?
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:26.960]   How much of it is separate?
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.720]   Is Chrome work?
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:31.400]   How much from Google goes back into WebKit, which
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:33.040]   is an open source project?
[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:33.800]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:34.800]   Yeah.
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.960]   We're all committers here to WebKit.
[00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:41.160]   We play nicely there, and we definitely push there.
[00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:44.400]   We work out of the WebKit tree very often.
[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.440]   And so yeah, we want to keep that very up-to-date
[00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:47.600]   with what we're doing.
[00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.520]   Certainly some aspects are not WebKit, like the V8 engine.
[00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:53.600]   But a lot of the HTML5 functionality,
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:56.160]   all that just flows right into WebKit.
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:58.720]   So Crank Chef is a Google-specific feature.
[00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:00.160]   It's not going to be returned.
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.520]   Currently, that's tied to the V8 JavaScript engine.
[00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.520]   That's right.
[00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:07.920]   So you have a great site, by the way, for HTML and HTML5.
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:10.520]   Advocacy site called HTML5 Rocks.
[00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.960]   This is a Google-sponsored site.
[00:07:12.960 --> 00:07:16.600]   Yeah, but we're actually trying to get that out and not
[00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:19.520]   be really browser or Google-centric at all.
[00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:23.840]   We post articles from outside resources, people
[00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:26.600]   that have done good work for us, and just for the web.
[00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.960]   And also, we just close which features
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:30.440]   work across different browsers.
[00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:32.600]   And so our main intention there is just
[00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:35.240]   to make sure that great HTML5 resources are out there
[00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:36.840]   for everyone.
[00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:40.080]   Because that's Chrome's technology toolkit.
[00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:42.160]   Every platform has an API.
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:45.840]   And Chrome's platform API at this very foundation,
[00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:47.520]   at its core, is HTML5.
[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:50.800]   And that, of course, is a fabric of the web.
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:53.000]   And so even the resources we put out there
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.560]   is all just about pushing the web forward
[00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:59.360]   across all different browsers, of course, including Chrome.
[00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:01.640]   Got to ask you about video.
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:02.040]   Yes.
[00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:05.640]   The Bracket Video Bracket Tag.
[00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:07.960]   And this is all about HTML5.
[00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:11.960]   The decision Google made to not support H.264,
[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:15.720]   but to support--
[00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:16.200]   WebM.
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:21.720]   WebM, which Google bought and is open sourcing.
[00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:22.400]   That's right.
[00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:24.040]   Yes, it's open source now.
[00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:26.920]   And really, the way I like to look at that decision
[00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:29.400]   is to the normal web developer-- that
[00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:33.760]   is the everyday web developer-- this actually changes nothing.
[00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:36.200]   To get coverage with your video codecs,
[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:40.040]   you're going to still need to encode H.264 and WebM.
[00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:43.320]   So really, I mean, the impact to the web developer
[00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:45.000]   is minimum to none.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:48.400]   And really, a lot of people use white-labeled video hosting
[00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:51.840]   services or branded ones like Vimeo or YouTube anyway.
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:56.080]   And they take care of the encodings, the social experience,
[00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:57.480]   the sharing, embedding, and all that.
[00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:58.960]   So really, in the end of the day,
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:01.960]   this really doesn't change anything for a web developer.
[00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:08.000]   It just changes what is official under the video tag in HTML5.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.960]   Certainly, we hope that the community eventually
[00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:16.760]   adopts an open source, high-quality video codec.
[00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:19.000]   And we believe WebM to be that option.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.680]   And so certainly, we want to keep promoting that
[00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:24.400]   as the go-to option for video on the web.
[00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:26.880]   And that's the option that Chrome supports,
[00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:30.680]   even if you don't put any plugins in.
[00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:33.640]   Absolutely, WebM comes right in with Chrome.
[00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:37.080]   Although Flash comes with Chrome right now.
[00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:37.600]   Absolutely.
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:38.680]   Are we going to see that stop?
[00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:40.080]   Is that going to end?
[00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:40.880]   No, I don't think so.
[00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:42.600]   We're really pragmatic about that.
[00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:44.880]   I mean, we're bullish about HTML5.
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:46.720]   We definitely think this is the future of the web
[00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:48.840]   for numerous reasons.
[00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:50.160]   But in the end of the day, you have
[00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:52.480]   to look at what's on the web today.
[00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:54.520]   And a lot of that is great Flash content.
[00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:57.480]   And so it behooves us to ensure our users have
[00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:58.400]   a great experience.
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:00.880]   And so we build that Flash plugin right into Chrome
[00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:03.800]   so we can also auto-update Flash for you, which
[00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:06.320]   is huge as well, because just like any other software,
[00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:08.880]   you want to make sure it's up to date with the latest.
[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:10.520]   And so it's just one last thing users
[00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:13.440]   have to worry about for just a great kind of smooth web
[00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:13.880]   experience.
[00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:15.120]   And of course, that includes Flash.
[00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:17.240]   You also sandbox it.
[00:10:17.240 --> 00:10:18.760]   Part of Chrome 10.
[00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:21.360]   Yes, that is a very exciting feature.
[00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:21.880]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:26.240]   Don't be, of course, announced its Flash HTML5 converter.
[00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:29.560]   Does anybody exist out there?
[00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:31.080]   It is out there today.
[00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:33.120]   I believe my team's taking a look at it now.
[00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:34.760]   I think it comes with a lot of caveats.
[00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:37.600]   But we definitely think this is really exciting
[00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:39.640]   for web developers.
[00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:41.520]   Something the Adobe does very well, of course,
[00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:43.120]   is tooling support.
[00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:46.640]   And so we hope they continue to support HTML5 and the web
[00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:47.360]   going forward.
[00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:49.280]   And so this is a great first step.
[00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:49.840]   They do not.
[00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:50.720]   It's very specific.
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:53.160]   They do not support video.
[00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:57.720]   So they avoid that whole H.264 web M, Flash Nexus.
[00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:59.880]   They just say, no, this isn't going to do video.
[00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:01.800]   But it is a lot of SVG support.
[00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:05.840]   SVG is HTML5's way of doing kind of animation.
[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:07.000]   Is that right?
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:10.240]   Well, SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics.
[00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:13.440]   So that's a way to actually embed graphics,
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:18.360]   like circles, rectangles, curves, directly into your HTML
[00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:22.480]   page, right alongside your head tags and title tags
[00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:23.960]   and all of that.
[00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:26.400]   It's interesting to compare that against another technology
[00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:28.880]   a lot of developers are familiar with, which is Canvas,
[00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:31.760]   which is your 2D bitmap drawing surface.
[00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:33.480]   So developers really have two options.
[00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:37.880]   They can work with high level blocks and circles
[00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:39.160]   right in their HTML page.
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:41.200]   Or they can just draw bits to a surface.
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:43.040]   And a lot of animation work is actually
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:45.960]   happening there as well in Canvas.
[00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:47.880]   I get it.
[00:11:47.880 --> 00:11:51.120]   You know, when you look at Chrome and the Chrome Web Store
[00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:54.680]   and all the capabilities that you get with HTML5,
[00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:57.600]   animation and graphics and offline use,
[00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:00.360]   Chrome really becomes a viable platform
[00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:03.120]   for releasing a desktop application.
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:06.920]   Like I built a command line task manager and an Android app.
[00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:08.080]   And we're having this open source.
[00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:09.440]   We're having this discussion on the mailing list.
[00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:12.080]   Like, hey, we want a desktop GUI for this.
[00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:13.680]   So what are some ways that we can build that?
[00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:16.120]   So the first one that came up with was Adobe Air, right?
[00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:18.160]   Because you want to write it once and have it run anywhere.
[00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:20.400]   So it was like, OK, Adobe Air, that can write--
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:22.840]   you can write that one way and I'll run it every platform.
[00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:26.160]   And then immediately somebody said, why not a Chrome app?
[00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:27.840]   And this is an app I don't want to do any hosting.
[00:12:27.840 --> 00:12:30.480]   I want this to be like all the data stored in Dropbox.
[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:34.120]   And I just want this to be offline in the browser
[00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:37.440]   and then communicate with Dropbox and have it all done in HTML5.
[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:37.920]   Is that--
[00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:38.440]   Absolutely.
[00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:40.160]   --and that is possible at this point, right?
[00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:41.360]   Like, given the Chrome Web Store,
[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:44.520]   you can package a web app into a totally a desktop--
[00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:46.440]   files that get saved in your desktop,
[00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:49.440]   which can do offline storage and maybe do some API calls
[00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:51.840]   to cloud sources, but not necessarily
[00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:54.680]   be a real website, right?
[00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:55.040]   Sure.
[00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:57.120]   So for those who don't know, Chrome Web Store
[00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:00.600]   is an open marketplace for great web apps and games.
[00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:03.840]   And it's a consumer-facing web store built right into Chrome.
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:06.560]   So you can find utility, productivity, entertainment,
[00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:08.520]   news, and of course games.
[00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:11.920]   There's two ways to build apps for the Chrome Web Store.
[00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:14.040]   One is your traditional hosted web app,
[00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:16.080]   which is like you're saying, you put it on a web server.
[00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:17.280]   It has a URL.
[00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:18.800]   Anyone can get to it.
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:20.520]   That's the very traditional one we're all familiar with.
[00:13:20.520 --> 00:13:22.000]   And then there's a second option, which
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.440]   is you're talking about, which is what we call a package
[00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:25.000]   app.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:28.480]   A package app is a self-contained HTML5 app
[00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:30.760]   that you can just fully upload to the Chrome Web Store.
[00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:33.960]   When someone installs it, they download that entire package.
[00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:35.480]   They run it locally.
[00:13:35.480 --> 00:13:37.200]   And you write no web servers involved.
[00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:41.680]   So in that model, it's a lot closer to a traditional software
[00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:44.440]   model, which is you send down all the bits
[00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:45.640]   and you just run it locally.
[00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:49.080]   But there is a limit to the size of that.
[00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:49.800]   Right.
[00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:53.000]   I think that's left over from the extension day.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.120]   So right now, the size limit is 10 megs.
[00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:58.440]   But we heard a lot of strong feedback from our partners
[00:13:58.440 --> 00:13:59.560]   saying, we need more.
[00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:02.680]   And so we're definitely looking at addressing that very soon.
[00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:03.200]   It's interesting.
[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:06.400]   I just installed on camera, Super Mario Brothers,
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:07.640]   thinking that might be a package.
[00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:08.880]   It's not.
[00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:10.040]   It's a web page.
[00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:13.680]   And I know because I'm getting an ad for a pregnancy test right
[00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:14.680]   now.
[00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:15.720]   Well, you know, it's interesting.
[00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:17.720]   When you install stuff from the Chrome Web Store,
[00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:19.680]   when I first looked at it as a tech reviewer,
[00:14:19.680 --> 00:14:22.560]   I thought, this doesn't look too different than just
[00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:24.360]   sort of like glorified bookmarks.
[00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:26.920]   But actually, it's much different.
[00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:30.320]   When you think about offline apps, it is a full on app store.
[00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:32.560]   So this is a flash game.
[00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:33.440]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:33.960]   Interesting.
[00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:35.240]   Seth, I have to ask you the question.
[00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:38.440]   Then I'm sure that everyone asks you, which is about Android
[00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:41.680]   and Chrome and how these two products are becoming platforms
[00:14:41.680 --> 00:14:43.320]   for app distribution and whether or not they
[00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:46.080]   compete with one another and how the teams interact at Google
[00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:47.920]   and how there are both.
[00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:53.000]   And is Chrome ever going to run fully on Android?
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:53.480]   Certainly.
[00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:56.480]   So I think the best way to look at that right now
[00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:59.320]   is that Chrome is a great experience for your desktop
[00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:02.480]   laptops and netbooks, things with keyboards.
[00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:05.360]   And Android is a great experience for smaller form factor
[00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:07.040]   devices without keyboards.
[00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:10.760]   And right now, that's I think how the teams are looking at it.
[00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:13.640]   Things happen very organically.
[00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:18.640]   But for now, we're building an ecosystem for the web
[00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:20.400]   and platforms with keyboards.
[00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:22.280]   They're building an ecosystem for mobile.
[00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:24.320]   And of course, they have a browser on there as well.
[00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:28.400]   And so a lot of this HTML5 capability works on Android as well.
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:31.640]   And that's oftentimes how we talk about it to our partners.
[00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:34.000]   We say, build with HTML5.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.680]   That's how you get across all these form factors--
[00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:40.720]   tablets, TVs even, of course, desktop laptops,
[00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:42.440]   netbooks, phones.
[00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:44.440]   Across the board, HTML5 is probably
[00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:49.360]   the most ubiquitous technology toolkit out there.
[00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:50.200]   Hopefully that helps.
[00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:52.560]   And it lets you play Centipede.
[00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:54.640]   Oh, that's awesome.
[00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:57.280]   That's a really amazing Centipede.
[00:15:57.280 --> 00:15:59.360]   I don't know if it's flash or--
[00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:01.160]   it's in the web store.
[00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:03.280]   But I mean, that's pretty impressive that--
[00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:06.440]   now, is the heart of the Android browser the same?
[00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:10.000]   I mean, is a JavaScript rendering engine the same and all that?
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.880]   Yeah, so absolutely a great point.
[00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:12.720]   It's just you, I--
[00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:14.520]   So you were talking about this different.
[00:16:14.520 --> 00:16:18.000]   Yeah, the Android browser is WebKit-based.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.480]   And we brought over a version of V8 as well.
[00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:25.480]   And so they do have a common ancestry, absolutely.
[00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:26.040]   OK.
[00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:28.920]   So we'll get advances in Chrome.
[00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:31.240]   We'll kind of migrate to Android.
[00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:32.800]   Yeah, via the WebKit route.
[00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:33.760]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:34.260]   Right.
[00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:37.320]   It's interesting on Google TV, the browser's called Chrome.
[00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:39.520]   But on every other Android build I've seen,
[00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:40.880]   it's just browser.
[00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:43.400]   So I wondered about whether or not there's a full kind of Chrome
[00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:44.600]   build on its way to Android.
[00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:49.160]   Yeah, and that's because the Google TV guys use Chrome.
[00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:50.920]   They have version 5 on there now.
[00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:53.680]   And they'll be updating that later.
[00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:57.120]   The Android guys just use a WebKit version of their browser.
[00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:59.280]   So it's a different browser.
[00:16:59.280 --> 00:16:59.780]   OK.
[00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:00.280]   OK.
[00:17:00.280 --> 00:17:00.600]   Interesting.
[00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:05.400]   Seth, the thing I can't wait for is offline reading of Gmail
[00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:09.760]   and such to bring back the things that we lost.
[00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:11.160]   When is that going to happen?
[00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:12.880]   Well, you and me both are waiting for that.
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:14.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:16.440]   That messages are loud and clear, absolutely.
[00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:18.760]   But to Gina's point as well, I think
[00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:21.000]   we had a lot of offline functionality with the product
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.560]   we maintained and launched a couple years ago, which
[00:17:23.560 --> 00:17:26.440]   was called Google Gears, which was a plug-in to browsers
[00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:29.240]   that brought a lot of this forward-thinking technology.
[00:17:29.240 --> 00:17:32.200]   And even some of that has rolled up now into HTML5.
[00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:33.920]   We've now deprecated Google Gears,
[00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:36.120]   and we will support HTML5 going forward.
[00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:39.400]   And so you'll see better functionality
[00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:41.760]   taking advantage of more of the platform going forward
[00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:43.160]   via HTML5.
[00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:45.280]   And that, of course, includes offline.
[00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:49.520]   Speaking of offline, there's just a wide array of options
[00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:51.920]   giving developers really great choice.
[00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:55.440]   Something called local storage, something called index DB.
[00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:58.600]   And then, of course, we have a sandboxed virtualized file
[00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:00.720]   system in HTML5 as well.
[00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:05.000]   So developers can now start building, for instance,
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:08.760]   games or photo editing apps, or you can store large objects
[00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:11.520]   actually into a virtualized sandbox file system
[00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:12.720]   via the browser.
[00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:15.440]   So bringing these strong offline capabilities
[00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:17.480]   is a big part of HTML5.
[00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:19.160]   Yeah, that's really cool.
[00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:22.000]   That makes me really want to build a GUI for my app
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.120]   in Chrome versus anywhere else.
[00:18:25.120 --> 00:18:28.160]   It's really kind of-- it becomes the kind of right ones
[00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:30.600]   run anywhere online, offline, dream.
[00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:32.880]   It's just working hard to make that reality.
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:34.160]   And yeah, I get scared when you say
[00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:35.920]   build it in Chrome instead of anywhere else,
[00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:37.240]   because isn't the web really supposed
[00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:40.840]   to be about completely cross-platform capabilities?
[00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:41.720]   Yes.
[00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:42.400]   Yeah.
[00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:43.800]   Well, yeah, that's interesting.
[00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:45.080]   I mean, so you can go either way.
[00:18:45.080 --> 00:18:46.520]   You can go with the hosted version
[00:18:46.520 --> 00:18:48.600]   where you're communicating with a web server
[00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:49.880]   and any browser can do that.
[00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:53.640]   But it's that offline that Chrome offers that's really--
[00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:56.720]   But is that going to be unique to Chrome or is that HTML5?
[00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:58.360]   Firefox won't also have it.
[00:18:58.360 --> 00:18:59.480]   That's a great point.
[00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:04.680]   Yeah, that comes with Firefox 4 and more modern browsers
[00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:07.000]   will bring along these technologies as well.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.720]   So I think you build for the best experience for your users,
[00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:11.480]   absolutely.
[00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:13.200]   And right now, that's the modern browsers.
[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:15.360]   Chrome just seems to be leading that
[00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:18.000]   because we have this very frequent automatic update.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.320]   But as other browsers like Firefox 4 come online,
[00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:23.120]   you just broaden and broaden your reach
[00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:26.720]   and yet get to deliver a great experience.
[00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:31.720]   HTML5 Rocks, your website, seems to be aimed at developers,
[00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:34.600]   particularly as opposed to end users.
[00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:37.360]   You start by getting developers to write for it.
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:38.800]   Definitely, definitely.
[00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:41.400]   We have some really great demo sites out there
[00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:43.400]   that appeal more to the eye candy end users.
[00:19:43.400 --> 00:19:46.720]   But right now, most of our efforts and outreach
[00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:50.120]   is absolutely centered around developers, web engineers,
[00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:53.240]   web programmers to get them excited and realize
[00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:55.440]   this is a viable option today.
[00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:57.040]   I mean, you build--
[00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:57.960]   This is great.
[00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:00.520]   I click the playground and I get an IDE.
[00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:02.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.200]   A full IDE with debugger.
[00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:04.840]   Yeah.
[00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:10.080]   I mean, I'm sure that the developer goes, whoa.
[00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:11.080]   Cool.
[00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:12.520]   That's pretty neat.
[00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:13.920]   So when you think about the cloud, right,
[00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:16.080]   and what Gene is talking about, putting everything
[00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:18.080]   in a Dropbox, just running in the client,
[00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:19.720]   this is a big deal for us.
[00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:23.480]   So you might have heard cloud 9 IDE is an option today
[00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:27.360]   that just came out of, I think, beta as a full IDE running
[00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:28.080]   in the cloud.
[00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:31.600]   And this cloud thinking becomes more and more important
[00:20:31.600 --> 00:20:34.680]   as you have cloud-connected networks like Chrome OS,
[00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:36.160]   which only runs Chrome.
[00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:37.720]   So of course, you need everything, even
[00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:39.760]   your development environment in the cloud.
[00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:42.280]   So these things are coming true.
[00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:44.120]   This is-- I mean, that was having my IDE,
[00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:45.640]   having my development environment in the cloud,
[00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:47.560]   was the one thing that kept me from using the--
[00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:51.000]   I have a CR48 and it's something that I wasn't able to use
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.560]   because I code day to day.
[00:20:52.560 --> 00:20:53.480]   So that's really cool.
[00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:55.560]   I hadn't heard of cloud9 IDE.com.
[00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:58.280]   That looks-- this just got released, I guess.
[00:20:58.280 --> 00:21:00.200]   It's also available in the web store,
[00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:01.960]   and you can find it via searching.
[00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:06.120]   So other people, I'm sure, will come out with cloud IDEs.
[00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:07.800]   It's the logical next step.
[00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:08.640]   Yeah, no doubt.
[00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:12.040]   And it integrates with GitHub, which is exciting.
[00:21:12.040 --> 00:21:12.680]   Yeah.
[00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:15.240]   So I had to speak in this year, 48, that Chrome OS--
[00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:18.920]   I mean, does your team also work with Chrome OS?
[00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:20.360]   Are those separate teams at Google?
[00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:22.880]   And how do updates roll out to Chrome OS?
[00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:26.960]   Those are two-- those are different releases, right?
[00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:31.000]   Chrome OS is a separate product, but the best way
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   to think about it is it's Chrome with a paper-thin Linux
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:37.520]   bootstrap layer.
[00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:39.400]   And so, yes, it's a separate product
[00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:41.680]   because it's built to run directly on netbooks.
[00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:44.760]   But the advice we give to our partners and developers
[00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:46.720]   is just build for Chrome.
[00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:49.880]   And you'll be successful on desktop, laptop, and now
[00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:51.120]   netbooks.
[00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:53.800]   And presumably compatible with other modern browsers
[00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:57.520]   as they come out, you're not doing Chrome-specific extensions.
[00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:58.760]   Oh, no, I'm sorry.
[00:21:58.760 --> 00:21:59.760]   Absolutely.
[00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:01.280]   When I say build for Chrome, I mean,
[00:22:01.280 --> 00:22:02.960]   that's how you hit Chrome OS, or that's
[00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:04.320]   the way you think about Chrome OS.
[00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:05.240]   You build for Chrome.
[00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:05.800]   Got it.
[00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:08.720]   Yeah, which is, right, modern HTML5 app.
[00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:09.320]   Absolutely.
[00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:10.880]   Right.
[00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:13.440]   Which is exciting because it means
[00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:16.960]   the universe for the CR48 and Chrome OS.
[00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:21.760]   Now, the guy running Chrome OS has departed for Facebook.
[00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:22.440]   Has he not?
[00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:23.960]   Isn't that where he went?
[00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:25.760]   Oh, I think I read something.
[00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:27.200]   I unfortunately can't comment on that.
[00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:28.600]   I just don't know the details there.
[00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:29.720]   Yeah, OK.
[00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:32.840]   But as far as your concern, Chrome OS is alive and kicking.
[00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:34.960]   It's a part of the Chrome ecosystem
[00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:36.160]   that we're building, definitely.
[00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:37.720]   Good.
[00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:40.560]   I booked marked a couple of sites during your talk.
[00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:42.880]   One was the HTML5Rocks.com.
[00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:45.440]   Another is html5boilerplate.com, which
[00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:48.040]   looks like a pretty good template for use.
[00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:50.160]   And another one is canIuse.com, which
[00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:53.200]   gives you a rundown of what browsers support what
[00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:54.560]   HTML5 capabilities.
[00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:56.440]   So as you're developing, like Seth said,
[00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:59.800]   you develop HTML5 capabilities.
[00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:02.360]   But then you can gracefully degrade for browsers
[00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:04.280]   that maybe haven't caught up yet.
[00:23:04.280 --> 00:23:05.960]   No, I'm really glad you brought that up.
[00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:08.160]   I mean, HTML5 Blurplate isn't really
[00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:11.120]   fantastic resource because it not only says,
[00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:12.840]   we can get you up on HTML5 today.
[00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:15.280]   It actually brings over a lot of the best practices
[00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:17.840]   that web developers has begun to discover.
[00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:20.880]   For many years, things like the best way to cache resources
[00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:24.320]   or not to cache, the best way to compress or not to compress.
[00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:28.000]   And all of these things have been kind of like old wives'
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:30.800]   tales or just like dark secrets of the magic.
[00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:32.600]   And they're pulling it all in together
[00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:35.440]   until just a few different configuration files, which
[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:36.960]   you can just use to bootstrap your project.
[00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:40.040]   So that's one thing I'm really happy to see.
[00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:42.720]   But I'm really glad you mentioned to hear you say gracefully
[00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:45.640]   degrade because I think that's the right way to approach
[00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:48.120]   HTML5 development.
[00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:50.680]   You really want to start to deliver the best possible
[00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:51.200]   experience.
[00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:52.920]   And the way to do that, of course,
[00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:55.520]   is to implement and utilize all these great HTML5 features
[00:23:55.520 --> 00:24:01.680]   like Canvas and CSS3, 3D transforms, the file system APIs,
[00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:04.360]   sorry, the history management API, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:06.640]   And these are going to give you essentially a native app
[00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:07.400]   feel.
[00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:08.800]   But of course, you want reach.
[00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:09.800]   That's why you go to the web.
[00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:11.360]   So you build for the best experience,
[00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:14.640]   that which generates revenue and excitement and eyeballs.
[00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:16.520]   But then because all of these specs
[00:24:16.520 --> 00:24:20.280]   are written understanding that it's a global worldwide open spec,
[00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:23.080]   you can gracefully degrade and provide--
[00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:24.080]   Unless you think about that.
[00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:28.160]   --teasing IE6 as I'm showing here.
[00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:33.320]   Comparison between IE6 in pink and Chrome 10 in green.
[00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:34.800]   Well, you know IE6.
[00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:36.320]   Even Microsoft now is saying--
[00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:37.080]   I apologize.
[00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:39.160]   Yeah, we talked about that site that says,
[00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:43.120]   stop using IE6 from Microsoft.
[00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:44.560]   That must crack you up.
[00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:46.000]   It's actually kind of exciting, Seth.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.120]   It seems like there's some real momentum building
[00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:50.280]   behind HTML5.
[00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:50.680]   And I think--
[00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:53.880]   Well, even mindly, as my son Jake says,
[00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:56.160]   it's the kind of the Prince spaghetti sauce.
[00:24:56.160 --> 00:24:56.960]   Oh, it's in there.
[00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:57.720]   That'll solve it.
[00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:00.240]   HTML5 will do that with every problem that came up.
[00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:02.920]   We got to get on with it and do it.
[00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:04.760]   Well, you can look at some of the game industry there,
[00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:06.480]   I think, is pushing hard on HTML5.
[00:25:06.480 --> 00:25:09.280]   I mean, Disney's recent acquisition of the game engine,
[00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:12.480]   I believe it's Rocket Pack or Rocket Engine there.
[00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:15.080]   Zynga is exploring HTML5.
[00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:18.480]   Facebook, of course, is investing in HTML5.
[00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:21.000]   Obviously, Google, Apple, and Microsoft
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:23.520]   all agree that it's the future.
[00:25:23.520 --> 00:25:25.320]   So we've all been agreeing it's the future,
[00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:26.800]   but this year, things are happening.
[00:25:26.800 --> 00:25:27.320]   And so you're right.
[00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:28.440]   This is very exciting.
[00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:29.920]   Seth, thank you so much for being here.
[00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:31.080]   We really appreciate it.
[00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:31.440]   Thanks, Seth.
[00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:32.280]   Appreciate any time.
[00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:33.280]   Thank you very much.
[00:25:33.280 --> 00:25:35.200]   And I guess the best place to find out more about this
[00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:37.840]   is html5rocks.com.
[00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:39.000]   But you're just about five.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.920]   Yeah, thank you so much.
[00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:41.240]   Thanks.
[00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:44.680]   Seth Ladd, from the Google, from the mothership,
[00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:46.480]   he is developer advocate at Google.
[00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:47.480]   Take care.
[00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:47.480]   Bye.
[00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:48.000]   Thanks, Seth.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   Bye bye.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   Bye bye.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   Bye bye.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   Bye bye.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   Bye bye.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   Bye bye.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   Bye bye.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   Bye bye.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   Bye bye.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.980]   That's neat.
[00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:53.880]   Thank you, Gina, for getting that for us.
[00:25:53.880 --> 00:25:54.400]   Sure.
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:54.900]   Sure.
[00:25:54.900 --> 00:25:55.400]   That was really fun.
[00:25:55.400 --> 00:25:56.000]   I like to--
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:56.400]   More of that.
[00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:57.000]   Yeah.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:57.500]   Yeah.
[00:25:57.500 --> 00:26:00.040]   It does feel encouraging that there is a momentum
[00:26:00.040 --> 00:26:01.480]   and things are actually happening.
[00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:05.960]   And it's-- point, I stopped using any other browser
[00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:07.360]   but Chrome quite a while ago.
[00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:09.360]   It's just so much better.
[00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:09.880]   I know.
[00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:11.520]   And I love Firefox.
[00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:13.640]   But when there was a new Firefox release,
[00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:14.600]   it was like a big deal.
[00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:15.760]   You downloaded.
[00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:19.520]   The extensions wouldn't be compatible with Chrome.
[00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:20.720]   It just happened to the background.
[00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:22.920]   You just don't think about it as much.
[00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:25.080]   It's just got so many great features.
[00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:25.960]   They've learned it.
[00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:28.160]   I think that's an important point just going forward.
[00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:34.440]   It was more-- I had lunch today with CTO at Adobe, Kevin Lynch.
[00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:36.520]   And he was talking about Adobe moving over more and more
[00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:37.920]   and more and more to cloud stuff.
[00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:39.920]   And you get to that point where applications can become
[00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:40.440]   more fluid.
[00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:43.560]   This whole idea of another version does become silly.
[00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:44.560]   Right.
[00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:46.040]   It's just we're always improving it.
[00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:46.920]   And here's an improvement.
[00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:47.560]   And there it is.
[00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:48.280]   And that's that.
[00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:50.160]   And you should be able to expect that that's
[00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:50.720]   going to be the case.
[00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:52.360]   It's a process rather than product.
[00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:53.840]   This is kind of typical in computers.
[00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:55.440]   I remember Tim Berners Lee telling me,
[00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:57.960]   I never thought anybody would look at URLs.
[00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:01.320]   We didn't ever intend for URLs to be exposed.
[00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:03.600]   Those are not HTTP colon slash slash.
[00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:05.480]   It's not designed for humans.
[00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:06.160]   Clearly.
[00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:07.560]   Yeah, obviously.
[00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:09.880]   And now I think-- I can't remember which browser it is.
[00:27:09.880 --> 00:27:12.440]   But one of the browsers is getting rid of that bar entirely.
[00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:14.920]   I don't know if that's Chrome or Firefox.
[00:27:14.920 --> 00:27:16.760]   You know, the funny thing there is I keep on wishing
[00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:18.960]   that that whole HTTP colon slash slash
[00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:23.760]   www was reduced to one colon.
[00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:27.480]   Something that we then we wouldn't need shorter URLs
[00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:28.080]   and Twitter.
[00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:30.800]   You don't need to tell the-- well, that's
[00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:32.200]   the problem with Twitter, which is--
[00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:32.480]   That's not safe.
[00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:34.960]   It doesn't know it's a URL because it doesn't have HTML.
[00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:37.120]   So it needs to be a shorter way to say this is a URL.
[00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:40.760]   That's just stupid Twitter, to be honest.
[00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:41.360]   Right, Gina?
[00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:43.040]   I mean, a little grep magic.
[00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:45.320]   And you could tell if it's a URL or not.
[00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:48.320]   You look for a TLD, preceded by a dot.
[00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:49.920]   You look for a slash.
[00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:51.960]   And maybe even-- ooh, you could even check
[00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:53.560]   to see if there's a website there.
[00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:54.560]   And see if it has malware.
[00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:55.880]   Not so hard to do.
[00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:56.140]   OK.
[00:27:56.140 --> 00:27:57.760]   So we get Twitter to fix, not the whole internet.
[00:27:57.760 --> 00:27:57.760]   Yes.
[00:27:57.760 --> 00:27:58.240]   Good idea.
[00:27:58.240 --> 00:27:59.640]   You don't have to fix the internet.
[00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:01.240]   Just fix Twitter.
[00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:02.560]   But that's exactly what happens.
[00:28:02.560 --> 00:28:05.480]   And that's, I'm sure, why URLs got exposed in the first place
[00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:06.160]   is Mosaic.
[00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:07.800]   And then Netscape did.
[00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:09.880]   And it didn't matter what Tim Berners-Lee thought.
[00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:12.200]   It mattered what people did.
[00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:16.200]   And that became how it was done, unfortunately.
[00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:17.440]   Hey, let's take a break.
[00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:20.040]   There's a lot of news, including Android malware.
[00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:24.280]   Gina, any gingerbread love for your Nexus One?
[00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:24.760]   Oh, yeah.
[00:28:24.760 --> 00:28:25.320]   I've got it.
[00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:25.820]   I've got it.
[00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:26.660]   You've got it legally.
[00:28:26.660 --> 00:28:27.420]   You've got it.
[00:28:27.420 --> 00:28:27.940]   You've got it.
[00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:29.060]   You've got it wrong.
[00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:30.460]   You didn't get the up.
[00:28:30.460 --> 00:28:32.540]   Because I'm still looking at my Nexus S for an update.
[00:28:32.540 --> 00:28:34.180]   I haven't seen a thing.
[00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:37.540]   Wait, the S-- oh, you're waiting for the OTA for the Nexus S.
[00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:38.340]   That's crazy.
[00:28:38.340 --> 00:28:39.180]   You still haven't gotten it.
[00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:39.680]   OK.
[00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:40.500]   That's weird.
[00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:42.620]   I know all the friends of the Nexus One who did get it.
[00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:43.700]   They got the OTA on the one.
[00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:45.060]   Well, you needed it more than the-- you
[00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:46.300]   needed it more than the X-Tid.
[00:28:46.300 --> 00:28:47.500]   S-Tid.
[00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:48.020]   Yes.
[00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:49.740]   The one-- let me just check.
[00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:52.900]   Because it really wouldn't be a day without checking system
[00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:55.300]   updates and saying, your system is currently
[00:28:55.300 --> 00:28:56.140]   up to date.
[00:28:56.140 --> 00:28:56.640]   Right.
[00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:59.560]   Android needs to learn a little from Chrome.
[00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:00.480]   Update faster.
[00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:01.160]   Just update it.
[00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:02.160]   I don't want to know.
[00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:03.240]   Just update, right.
[00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:03.880]   Let's take a break.
[00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:08.640]   We got more coming up, also some issues with--
[00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:10.000]   I mentioned Android.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:13.360]   Google Apps Marketplace celebrating a birthday.
[00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:16.080]   And YouTube with an interesting acquisition
[00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:17.160]   that finally came through.
[00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:18.320]   Before we do that, though, I want
[00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:20.800]   to talk a little bit about Hover.com.
[00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:24.000]   Hover is domain name registration done properly.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:24.560]   It's clean.
[00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:25.060]   It's simple.
[00:29:25.060 --> 00:29:25.440]   It's easy.
[00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:27.200]   If you use the other guys, you know,
[00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:30.900]   you can't buy a domain with one click of the mouse.
[00:29:30.900 --> 00:29:31.840]   50 clicks later.
[00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:33.440]   And you're still saying, no, I didn't want that.
[00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:34.320]   No, I don't want that.
[00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:35.360]   No, thank you.
[00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:37.820]   I just want to buy a friggin' domain.
[00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:45.200]   Go to twig.hov.com and take a look at Hover.
[00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:48.360]   This couldn't be simpler, cleaner, or easier to use.
[00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:52.160]   It's domain name registration made simple.
[00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:52.640]   You go there.
[00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:54.560]   You tell them the domain you want.
[00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:55.840]   A couple of clicks of the mouse later,
[00:29:55.840 --> 00:29:56.880]   you've got the domain.
[00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:58.080]   And here's the beauty of it.
[00:29:58.080 --> 00:30:00.000]   They don't have to do the upsell in privacy
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.560]   because they just build it in.
[00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:03.760]   Automatic who is privacy and more.
[00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:06.520]   And if you are moving a domain over, if you're transferring,
[00:30:06.520 --> 00:30:07.880]   what a great deal.
[00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:09.360]   It costs $10 to transfer.
[00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:13.400]   But you get an additional year on your domain name.
[00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:16.920]   So they extend the domain name for a year.
[00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:19.920]   And you get the transfer.
[00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:21.840]   So I think that's pretty exceptional.
[00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:24.840]   Use Hover domain management to set up an email address,
[00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:28.000]   forward email, redirect domains,
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.400]   to other websites, create URL extensions, set privacy controls,
[00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:33.160]   all with fewer clicks and without them
[00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:36.280]   trying to sell you something you don't want or you don't need.
[00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:38.240]   And if you're transferring a bunch of sites,
[00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:41.040]   they've got a great one fee, $25 fee,
[00:30:41.040 --> 00:30:43.200]   for transferring all your sites from 1 to 1,000
[00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:44.960]   right over to Hover.com.
[00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:46.160]   Do us a favor and give it a try.
[00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:49.840]   And please use the twig offer code when you do.
[00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:51.360]   So we get credit for it.
[00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:53.720]   Those other guys that twit, they don't need the money.
[00:30:53.720 --> 00:30:58.240]   Twig, I'm competing against myself.
[00:30:58.240 --> 00:31:02.840]   twig.hover.com, twig.hovir.com.
[00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:06.440]   Please, please do it for Jeff and Gina.
[00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:07.520]   Use the offer code twig.
[00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:10.320]   Well, it has come to my attention that some of you,
[00:31:10.320 --> 00:31:12.880]   not remembering the offer code, just use twit.
[00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:14.840]   'Cause it all goes the same place, right?
[00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:16.240]   Bad fans, bad.
[00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:17.560]   Bad fan.
[00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:18.800]   It doesn't cost us anything.
[00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:22.760]   'Cause we don't do cost per click or anything like that.
[00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:26.280]   But it does mean that our advertisers don't know
[00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:28.680]   where they're getting the references referrals from.
[00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:30.680]   And we wanna make sure that they know people
[00:31:30.680 --> 00:31:32.720]   listen to this fine show and support it.
[00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:37.800]   So twig.hovir.com.
[00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:41.360]   Now we got to 12 minutes till Marissa Meyer shows up.
[00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:42.200]   No, no, no.
[00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:43.040]   I'm okay.
[00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:44.320]   We can go to like 515 or something.
[00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:46.320]   No, no, no, no.
[00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:48.560]   I don't wanna be the guy who made you late.
[00:31:48.560 --> 00:31:50.880]   I just, Leo, I know you now.
[00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:51.880]   Yes, you've learned.
[00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:54.160]   Say this, who started six.
[00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:55.360]   You're absolutely right.
[00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:56.520]   I know you and I love you.
[00:31:56.520 --> 00:31:58.280]   You're not Leo, but yeah, we'll do that thing
[00:31:58.280 --> 00:31:59.240]   where you set the alarm,
[00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:01.920]   15 minutes early to try to trick yourself into a...
[00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:04.360]   It doesn't work 'cause I know I'm tricking myself.
[00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:06.480]   You run on a California clock.
[00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:07.320]   Yeah.
[00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:08.440]   (laughing)
[00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:09.760]   That's true.
[00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:11.840]   Gina, I don't know what your problem is.
[00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:12.680]   I'm timing.
[00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:13.520]   Here's New York.
[00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:14.360]   New York time.
[00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:15.200]   Come on.
[00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:16.200]   I'm always late.
[00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:17.880]   So in New York, I was always late.
[00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:19.920]   In California, I kind of sort of make it on time.
[00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:20.760]   You're on time.
[00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:21.600]   'Cause it's three hours later.
[00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:22.440]   I showed up.
[00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:24.760]   We had a doctor's appointment at 8.30, showed up at 8.42.
[00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:26.520]   They said, "Yeah, that's fine."
[00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:28.000]   (laughing)
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:29.200]   We'd expect that.
[00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:30.280]   (laughing)
[00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:31.480]   It's California.
[00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:33.240]   Hey, I don't be late for our event
[00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:34.280]   at South by Southwest.
[00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:35.880]   We're gonna be down there this weekend.
[00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:38.720]   Everybody, I look forward to this.
[00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:40.000]   I won't, this is my second time.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:40.840]   I never went before.
[00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:42.480]   I know Gina, you've been since almost the beginning
[00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:43.760]   and everybody always said,
[00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:45.120]   "Go, you gotta go to South by."
[00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:46.280]   And now I understand why.
[00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:48.240]   It's just a freakin' party.
[00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:49.080]   It is.
[00:32:49.080 --> 00:32:49.920]   I'm really looking forward to it.
[00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:50.800]   I don't know what I was thinking,
[00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:51.760]   considering not going.
[00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:53.400]   I'm really excited about this weekend.
[00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:54.240]   Well, when you get there,
[00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:55.960]   make sure you get our Get Glue sticker.
[00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:57.200]   I think if you watch a Twitch show
[00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:58.240]   and you use Get Glue now,
[00:32:58.240 --> 00:32:59.880]   you'll get our limited edition,
[00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:03.680]   Twitch South by Southwest sticker from Get Glue.
[00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:05.600]   And then come to Momo's Sunday.
[00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:08.480]   This Sunday, we're gonna be there from one till,
[00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:10.280]   we start with one with the Tech Guy show
[00:33:10.280 --> 00:33:12.800]   and we will continue with Twitch.
[00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:14.720]   Five o'clock you guys will be there five to seven p.m.
[00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:15.880]   We're doing a little meetup afterwards.
[00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:20.320]   And we have 1,000 of these special edition Twitch stickers.
[00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:22.560]   I think we're gonna do these from now on for every event.
[00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:26.320]   So it says, "Twit @SXSW2011"
[00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:28.920]   and the zero is the state of Texas.
[00:33:28.920 --> 00:33:30.040]   Oh, I need that.
[00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:30.880]   Yeah.
[00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:31.720]   Yeah.
[00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:33.000]   My thinking, and we will have regular Twitch stickers too,
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:36.240]   but I'm thinking, don't you wanna collect sets of stickers
[00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:37.480]   from different events?
[00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:39.040]   So I thought that'd be kind of fun.
[00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:41.480]   You can find out more by going to our blog
[00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:44.920]   inside.twit.tv, that's where the schedule will be.
[00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:47.440]   And we also have a Plancast account,
[00:33:47.440 --> 00:33:52.440]   plancast.com/p/3X2S.
[00:33:52.440 --> 00:33:57.360]   I might as well just say, "HTTP colon slash slash"
[00:33:57.360 --> 00:33:58.680]   for that one.
[00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:00.800]   Holy cow.
[00:34:00.800 --> 00:34:03.640]   Slash p/3X2S.
[00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:04.560]   Is that like Twitch?
[00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:05.760]   I don't even know what that one is.
[00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:08.440]   I guess we created a Twitch Plancast account.
[00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:12.400]   So, Chrome 10, we already mentioned that, that's out.
[00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:13.240]   Everybody likes it.
[00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:14.200]   No negatives, right?
[00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:15.560]   No complaints?
[00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:16.560]   Oh, Morgan, for me.
[00:34:16.560 --> 00:34:18.280]   Faster, sandboxed.
[00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:19.400]   I love the sandboxing.
[00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:20.240]   That's key.
[00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:21.080]   That's critical.
[00:34:21.080 --> 00:34:22.760]   I mean, that's really critical.
[00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:27.760]   Instant mobile previews are now available on Android and iOS.
[00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:30.600]   Yeah, these are really cool.
[00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:32.880]   So there's a little magnifying glass next to search results
[00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:35.320]   on google.com on your phone, and you tap on it,
[00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:38.120]   and you can just sort of swipe through screenshots
[00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:40.120]   of the site, which is neat.
[00:34:40.120 --> 00:34:41.200]   I'm not sure.
[00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:42.840]   I generally know what I'm looking for,
[00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:44.400]   but in the case where you're not sure,
[00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:45.560]   really neat little feature.
[00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:46.760]   So it's a little magnifying glass
[00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:48.120]   in the bottom right of the search result.
[00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:50.200]   You don't really think of these things
[00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:54.680]   as being not only needed, but even working on a phone.
[00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:55.520]   I'm writing my name.
[00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:56.360]   Yeah, it's true.
[00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:57.240]   You know, for phones that have mobile versions
[00:34:57.240 --> 00:35:00.200]   that are crappy or for sites that take a long time to load,
[00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:02.240]   an instant preview via Google, which is fast,
[00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:04.000]   is a nice way to just check to see,
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.520]   does this look like what I'm looking for?
[00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:07.600]   Oh, I guess, yeah.
[00:35:07.600 --> 00:35:08.880]   You're right.
[00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:11.120]   And they cash those locally.
[00:35:11.120 --> 00:35:13.720]   I'm not locally on the Goog.
[00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:14.760]   Right. Right.
[00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:17.680]   So there's no load time or anything, or less load time.
[00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:19.320]   Right, well, I've only tried it on Wi-Fi,
[00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:20.840]   so I'm not sure how it does on 3G,
[00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:23.360]   but it was pretty fast when I did try it.
[00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:24.120]   That's cool.
[00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:27.840]   iOS 4.3 came out today too, by the way,
[00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:30.640]   if you're an iPhone user, like, yeah.
[00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:32.640]   Jeffrey, you've gone Android, right?
[00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:33.880]   No, I both.
[00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:34.720]   Are you gonna get it?
[00:35:34.720 --> 00:35:35.560]   I have my--
[00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:36.400]   I have my iPhone.
[00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:39.760]   And you aren't gonna get a iPad 2, right?
[00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:40.600]   I don't know.
[00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:41.960]   Friday night.
[00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:43.560]   I don't know, he says.
[00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:44.400]   I don't know.
[00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:47.280]   My wife looked at me and basically, what are you saying?
[00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:48.720]   (laughing)
[00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:50.520]   Oh, come on, Jeff.
[00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:51.360]   All right, let's see.
[00:35:51.360 --> 00:35:53.440]   I think I have it fired up here.
[00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:54.280]   Let's see.
[00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:56.200]   Oh yeah, look, there's a little magnifying glass.
[00:35:56.200 --> 00:35:57.680]   So that wasn't an update in the browser.
[00:35:57.680 --> 00:35:59.360]   That's just built into Google.
[00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:00.800]   And I click it and then look at this.
[00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:02.080]   These are the little thumbnails.
[00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:03.960]   In a page--
[00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:06.160]   Oh, that is sweet.
[00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:07.000]   That is nice, right?
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:07.840]   That is nice.
[00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:08.680]   That is sweet.
[00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:10.640]   Yeah, so look, there is a little load time there.
[00:36:10.640 --> 00:36:11.480]   Yeah.
[00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:12.560]   But for the most part, it's nice to see, like,
[00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:15.080]   oh, is this the site I was looking for?
[00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:15.920]   And these are--
[00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:18.600]   If you go back, you just go back to your search result.
[00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:19.440]   Oh, I don't know.
[00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:20.840]   Good question.
[00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:22.400]   Oh, there's no back button on the whole--
[00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:23.240]   There it is.
[00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:24.080]   There it is.
[00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:24.680]   Yes, it's a live phone.
[00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:25.520]   We don't have that.
[00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:27.120]   I wish you had that kind of UI within, let's say, Twitter
[00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:30.440]   where you could see a photo more easily or--
[00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:32.680]   So this is what it's doing is just pulling thumbnails up
[00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:34.120]   from-- and a cache to, by the way.
[00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:35.880]   Thumbnails up from the whole page.
[00:36:35.880 --> 00:36:38.080]   So this is like a different kind of search page
[00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:39.760]   with the thumbnails.
[00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:41.760]   And it does show the search results below it.
[00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:43.200]   So that's kind of--
[00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:45.280]   I think that's kind of a swell feature.
[00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:45.560]   Yeah.
[00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:46.080]   Yeah.
[00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:47.080]   Yeah.
[00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:48.560]   Pretty good.
[00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:50.280]   Wow, I didn't even know that.
[00:36:50.280 --> 00:36:52.120]   I have to listen to this show more often.
[00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:55.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:36:55.120 --> 00:36:56.920]   One of these days, I'm going to listen to this show.
[00:36:56.920 --> 00:36:58.160]   And I'll learn a thing or two.
[00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:02.600]   Google has discovered 21 malware apps
[00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:04.000]   on the Android marketplace.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.240]   Yanked them, but did something that we didn't know--
[00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:08.400]   Well, I think they did it once before.
[00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:09.960]   Still, it's kind of always a little bit of a shock
[00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:10.640]   when they do this.
[00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:13.160]   They use the kill switch.
[00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:13.720]   Right.
[00:37:13.720 --> 00:37:14.220]   Right.
[00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:16.560]   And this is the kill switch, the kill switch is for.
[00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:18.960]   They remotely uninstalled the apps from phones
[00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:20.320]   that they knew it was installed on.
[00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:21.960]   And they know what's installed on your phone
[00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:23.440]   when you do it through the market.
[00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:26.000]   So these apps were attempting to root the phone
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:27.520]   and get personal information about the phone
[00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:30.720]   the IMEI number, which is a unique T10 set
[00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:32.760]   and some other information.
[00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:35.520]   As soon as Google knew about it, they said within minutes,
[00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:38.600]   they used this application removal feature,
[00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:40.520]   which basically just reaches down to your phone
[00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:42.480]   and not installs it.
[00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:45.080]   See, I had chess and super sex positions.
[00:37:45.080 --> 00:37:45.520]   So--
[00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:47.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:51.520]   Screaming sexy Japanese girls, falling dodge ball.
[00:37:51.520 --> 00:37:52.120]   You know what?
[00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:53.840]   They're covering the waterfront, because they've
[00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:57.880]   also got scientific calculator advanced currency converter
[00:37:57.880 --> 00:37:59.720]   and a game called Pew Pew.
[00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:04.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:07.320]   This is just the worst PR for Android ever.
[00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:10.200]   I mean, it just makes everyone who's ever been annoyed
[00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:12.920]   with the iTunes stores, policies, go, see,
[00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:14.080]   this is why they do it.
[00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:15.160]   I'm malware.
[00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:17.960]   And it just-- it makes you just feel like you're back
[00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:22.520]   in the heyday windows when malware was this huge problem.
[00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:24.960]   Viruses and Trojans, I just feel like, I
[00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:27.240]   feel like because Google has the market,
[00:38:27.240 --> 00:38:28.520]   there should be-- I don't know, there needs
[00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:32.120]   to be better sort of reviewing, testing, a detection
[00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:35.560]   of this kind of stuff before things get published.
[00:38:35.560 --> 00:38:38.840]   As a developer, I wouldn't mind having to run my app
[00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:42.040]   through a series or like an automated test suite
[00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:46.840]   on Android Market side and get approved.
[00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:49.000]   Well, one of you had that idea before where you have
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:50.840]   a higher level marketplace.
[00:38:50.840 --> 00:38:52.600]   Yeah, you don't have to eliminate open,
[00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:56.400]   but you just say, maybe you could charge for it.
[00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:57.400]   I would probably--
[00:38:57.400 --> 00:38:58.240]   I would probably like--
[00:38:58.240 --> 00:39:00.120]   Or maybe that's the value that Amazon should add.
[00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:00.620]   Right.
[00:39:00.620 --> 00:39:03.080]   Why does an Amazon or Sequoonea or somebody say,
[00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:04.760]   hey, here's the secure marketplace.
[00:39:04.760 --> 00:39:07.860]   I know why, because you cannot-- and no matter what Apple
[00:39:07.860 --> 00:39:10.040]   tells anybody, you cannot do 100%--
[00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:13.200]   You can't always detect the exploits, right?
[00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:15.840]   You can sometimes-- I mean, the Amazon App Store for Android
[00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:17.000]   does have a review process.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:18.620]   I submitted my app, and it took them a couple weeks
[00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:19.040]   to approve it.
[00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:19.960]   Really?
[00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:22.320]   Yeah, yeah, it has launched yet.
[00:39:22.320 --> 00:39:24.120]   Another interesting model is Mozilla.
[00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:26.140]   So I developed Firefox extensions.
[00:39:26.140 --> 00:39:28.720]   And when you upload your extension to the Mozilla Add-On
[00:39:28.720 --> 00:39:30.820]   site, it just goes through all the code, which
[00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:34.860]   is just XML and JavaScript, and checks for external URLs,
[00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:37.580]   and then must have some sort of database, which flags
[00:39:37.580 --> 00:39:40.620]   certain URLs, which are good or bad or malware.
[00:39:40.620 --> 00:39:42.620]   So it had these little checks, and I'll say,
[00:39:42.620 --> 00:39:43.380]   we found this URL.
[00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:44.820]   We're not sure about it.
[00:39:44.820 --> 00:39:48.620]   Or give you the green thumbs up and the red stop.
[00:39:48.620 --> 00:39:51.540]   Android market could do something like passes
[00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:56.260]   the extra super clean malware check certification stamp.
[00:39:56.260 --> 00:39:56.660]   You know what I mean?
[00:39:56.660 --> 00:39:58.460]   That maybe is a developer you pay for.
[00:39:58.460 --> 00:39:59.840]   There are other ways to do it.
[00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:01.240]   You don't have to sacrifice open, I think,
[00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:04.800]   to do these extra checks and have maybe a higher level.
[00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:08.780]   The elite class of apps that have been verified somehow.
[00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:10.700]   Google might make a case that the system does work,
[00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:12.280]   because they did find these 21.
[00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:14.440]   They did use the kill switch.
[00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:17.680]   So how long were they in the market
[00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:18.880]   before they were discovered?
[00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:19.800]   Not that long.
[00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:21.360]   A week, two weeks.
[00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:22.080]   That's the question.
[00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:24.720]   I mean, the question really is, how many installations
[00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:27.960]   were there, and how much information got leaked?
[00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:31.360]   I would hope that Google would let that information come out.
[00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:31.760]   Question.
[00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:34.520]   So if you go through Amazon, Amazon
[00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:36.760]   is not going to have a kill switch.
[00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:37.800]   No, but Google still will.
[00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:38.720]   So presumably Amazon--
[00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:39.920]   Well, OK, fine.
[00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:42.200]   Say to Google, please kill these.
[00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:44.720]   Google, by the way, I was told by our chat room
[00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:47.480]   somebody got killed, and Google sends out an email.
[00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:50.480]   You get an email saying, we deleted an app from your phone
[00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:51.480]   because it was malicious.
[00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:54.480]   I can't imagine anybody getting upset about that.
[00:40:54.480 --> 00:40:54.760]   No.
[00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:55.760]   No.
[00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:56.520]   No.
[00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:57.640]   No, I mean, we'll well believe me.
[00:40:57.640 --> 00:41:00.120]   We'll hear somebody say, well, Google could be evil with that.
[00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:01.400]   They could misuse it and all that.
[00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:03.440]   But if Google did, then they're hurting their own business
[00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:04.080]   for God's sakes.
[00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:05.440]   And every phone has this.
[00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:07.080]   I mean, iOS has a kill switch.
[00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:07.520]   We know it.
[00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:08.520]   I'm glad they have it.
[00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:08.880]   They need it.
[00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:10.320]   I'm fine with it.
[00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:12.240]   What we don't want is that you don't want them to use it
[00:41:12.240 --> 00:41:14.280]   evenly, and that's really the issue.
[00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:17.200]   But if they kill a book or something, that's a problem.
[00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:21.400]   So in the Google mobile blog, they
[00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:23.280]   say Tuesday that we were made aware of this
[00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:27.600]   within minutes becoming aware we removed the applications.
[00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:33.760]   They did take advantage of a flaw in the current 2.2 or higher
[00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:36.520]   versions of Android, which is a little--
[00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:39.480]   doesn't say they've got the update.
[00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:42.600]   It doesn't say how long they were out there.
[00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:44.000]   But--
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.040]   and at war, who told them?
[00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:49.160]   Does that mean that there are some security people watching?
[00:41:49.160 --> 00:41:52.160]   It wouldn't be such a hard thing to look at what kind of stuff
[00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:55.640]   your phone is doing online.
[00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:57.200]   I just wish that they caught this stuff poor.
[00:41:57.200 --> 00:41:58.800]   It went down to people's phones.
[00:41:58.800 --> 00:41:59.760]   Right.
[00:41:59.760 --> 00:42:01.440]   That's what we want.
[00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:05.480]   Android is number one in US smartphone market share now
[00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:07.480]   outpacing RIM.
[00:42:07.480 --> 00:42:09.040]   So they beat iOS a little while ago.
[00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:09.920]   Now they've beat RIM.
[00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:11.120]   There's nobody else.
[00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:12.760]   They are number one.
[00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:17.440]   According to Nielsen, Android has 29% market share.
[00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:19.560]   Oh, are these your numbers?
[00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:20.040]   No.
[00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:20.640]   Good.
[00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:21.720]   20s.
[00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:23.720]   I have your trained wellie on cloud.
[00:42:23.720 --> 00:42:24.720]   It's a number.
[00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:27.000]   I'll say anything numeric we worry about.
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:29.960]   Jeff has his trademark at all numbers.
[00:42:29.960 --> 00:42:32.400]   I'm going to put a charge on your chair, on your ball.
[00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:34.480]   [MUMBLING]
[00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:39.360]   Actually, Apple and RIM are tied with 27.
[00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:41.320]   Now that is consumer market share.
[00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:42.920]   Nielsen also notes that when you look at it
[00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:45.600]   from a different angle, manufacturer market share.
[00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:47.960]   Because of course, Apple makes one phone.
[00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:49.880]   BlackBerry makes a number of phones.
[00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:52.280]   Google doesn't make any phones, but there are a lot of people
[00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:54.880]   making phones using the Google OS.
[00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:57.880]   When it comes to handset manufacturers, Apple and RIM
[00:42:57.880 --> 00:42:59.160]   are clearly ahead.
[00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:03.000]   The next biggest manufacturer, Apple and RIM, have 27%.
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:08.480]   Next biggest manufacturer is HTC, 12% Android, 7% Windows
[00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:10.960]   mobile.
[00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:13.040]   So and Windows Phone 7.
[00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:17.400]   So 12% if you talk about the biggest manufacturer, which is
[00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:19.000]   HTC.
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:21.280]   Still, I mean, that was the same argument people made about
[00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:23.320]   PC market share versus Mac market share.
[00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:24.600]   But there's only one Apple.
[00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:28.840]   Well, still, they're all running Windows.
[00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:33.200]   Google has released an anti-fragmentation kit to respond
[00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:37.680]   to complaints that the Android market is fragmented.
[00:43:37.680 --> 00:43:41.040]   This is a programmer Gina at the ready.
[00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:41.760]   What is this?
[00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:45.080]   It says it's a static library that allows access to the
[00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:46.800]   Honeycomb Fragments API.
[00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:53.640]   OK, so when you develop an Android app, you
[00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:58.400]   set a version at which the baseline version that it's
[00:43:58.400 --> 00:43:59.160]   compatible with.
[00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:02.560]   So my app is at compatible 1.6 and above.
[00:44:02.560 --> 00:44:05.800]   But what you don't want to do is make--
[00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:07.880]   you don't want that to mean that you don't have access to
[00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:10.920]   only the features that are available to later versions.
[00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:13.360]   So I have not tried out this static library, but it sounds
[00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:16.280]   like this library lets developers take advantage of
[00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:19.920]   the stuff available on Honeycomb, that Fragments library
[00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:22.080]   that lets you create panels that arrange themselves in
[00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:24.560]   different ways on a larger screen in their app without
[00:44:24.560 --> 00:44:28.960]   sacrificing earlier compatibility with earlier versions.
[00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:30.920]   I always wondered why they didn't do that, because it
[00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:33.560]   seems like it'd be possible to write an app that automatically
[00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:34.760]   senses what's out--
[00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:37.080]   because unfortunately, there's a big variety of screen
[00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:38.400]   resolution in real estate.
[00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:41.160]   But it would sense that and kind of rearrange itself
[00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:42.360]   elastically.
[00:44:42.360 --> 00:44:42.880]   Right.
[00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:45.000]   Isn't that what Adobe Air does?
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:46.400]   Yes, right.
[00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:47.920]   Yeah, I mean, that's what a web browser does.
[00:44:47.920 --> 00:44:50.960]   It lays out a page depending on the viewport size.
[00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:53.440]   And so the new static library allows access to Honeycomb
[00:44:53.440 --> 00:44:56.000]   Fragments API, which lets developers produce resolution
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:00.440]   independent apps on any device running Android 1.6 or better.
[00:45:00.440 --> 00:45:03.360]   So from diminutive pay go phones to 10.1 tablets.
[00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:06.240]   So this is just a way to lay out your apps so that it
[00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:09.560]   shows up well, no matter what the screen size is.
[00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:10.920]   Easy fix.
[00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:13.480]   In response to Steve Jobs last week saying there's only
[00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:16.800]   100 Honeycomb apps.
[00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:18.400]   And I thought that was a little--
[00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:20.440]   I mean, that's kind of not fair, because yes, there's 100
[00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:22.320]   apps written for that size tablet.
[00:45:22.320 --> 00:45:25.360]   But there's hundreds of thousands of apps written for all
[00:45:25.360 --> 00:45:25.920]   Android.
[00:45:25.920 --> 00:45:27.160]   And what is--
[00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:28.360]   I don't-- have you looked at--
[00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:31.520]   well, I remember when I had the Galaxy Tab, even apps that
[00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:33.560]   weren't written for a seven inch screen for the most part
[00:45:33.560 --> 00:45:34.160]   looked fine.
[00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:34.920]   They looked great.
[00:45:34.920 --> 00:45:35.560]   They looked wonderful.
[00:45:35.560 --> 00:45:37.360]   Yeah, I really, frankly, ever noticed.
[00:45:37.360 --> 00:45:37.560]   Yeah.
[00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:40.480]   If you use layouts well in your app, it would just size up
[00:45:40.480 --> 00:45:41.120]   to the screen.
[00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:43.920]   And that's just sort of the nature of the layout, the way
[00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:44.800]   that you do layouts.
[00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:47.040]   And Android might have worked fine on Honeycomb.
[00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:49.400]   I mean, there's a lot of extra white space.
[00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:51.120]   When I do rewrite it for Honeycomb,
[00:45:51.120 --> 00:45:52.920]   I'll take advantage of the fact that I could fit another
[00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:53.320]   panel.
[00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:54.840]   But it totally works.
[00:45:54.840 --> 00:45:56.720]   I mean, look, Steve has a point.
[00:45:56.720 --> 00:45:59.760]   When the first iPad came out, one of my arguments against
[00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:02.480]   buying it was none of the apps have been written for this
[00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:03.960]   large screen yet.
[00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:06.200]   So I mean, I think that that's a reasonable argument to me.
[00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:09.160]   Well, it's a little different in iOS, because on iOS, what
[00:46:09.160 --> 00:46:11.040]   happens if you have an iPhone app?
[00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:13.560]   It's tiny, and you could double it.
[00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:16.640]   There is no resizing at all.
[00:46:16.640 --> 00:46:17.600]   And so Google--
[00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:19.920]   I mean, Android handles it better, I think, better,
[00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:20.520]   and differently.
[00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:23.840]   So there's a big difference between there aren't native iPad
[00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:26.600]   apps and there aren't native tablet apps for Android.
[00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:27.440]   That's a big difference.
[00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:28.560]   Yeah, I think you're right.
[00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:29.040]   I think you're right.
[00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:30.920]   I think the fact that the way that Android, when you lay
[00:46:30.920 --> 00:46:34.200]   out views at Android just expands naturally, because
[00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:37.040]   handsets have different size screens to begin with,
[00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:39.840]   unlike the iPhone, that things did expand to fill Honeycomb
[00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:40.200]   well.
[00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:42.880]   So Steve's argument is not as strong as maybe the initial
[00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:44.920]   argument with the iPad.
[00:46:44.920 --> 00:46:48.200]   But I do hope to see a lot of really good apps kind of
[00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:49.760]   expand to fill that Honeycomb screen.
[00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:52.600]   But things like Angry Birds are fantastic on Honeycomb,
[00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:52.920]   right?
[00:46:52.920 --> 00:46:54.000]   You're not going to change anything.
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:55.920]   You're not going to add panels or anything.
[00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:59.520]   And do you get glitches with the graphics, like jaggies,
[00:46:59.520 --> 00:47:03.400]   you know, artifacting, or aliasing, or the fonts,
[00:47:03.400 --> 00:47:06.200]   or to font scale nicely, and graphics scale nicely?
[00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:07.720]   Do you have those issues?
[00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:10.240]   From what I saw on the emulator in the 10 or 20 minutes
[00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:12.600]   I spent with the app itself, everything looks great.
[00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:13.440]   It scales up.
[00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:16.200]   So Android gives you-- so when you create your graphics
[00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:19.920]   for Android, there's a low CM and high resolution.
[00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:23.240]   You provide assets for high resolution and smaller
[00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:23.600]   resolution.
[00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:24.160]   I see.
[00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:26.280]   So they are bit mapped assets.
[00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:27.200]   Yeah.
[00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:29.720]   Although I imagine there's also vector graphics.
[00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:31.240]   That's where SVG would be great.
[00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:34.640]   And I imagine the fonts, do the fonts scale in Todoot Text?
[00:47:34.640 --> 00:47:38.440]   Todoot Text does the font scale so that they don't look jaggy,
[00:47:38.440 --> 00:47:38.840]   do they?
[00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:39.600]   No, not at all.
[00:47:39.600 --> 00:47:40.520]   They look great.
[00:47:40.520 --> 00:47:42.240]   They're anti-aliased.
[00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:43.920]   So I think that that's a little misleading to say
[00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:44.840]   there's only 100 apps.
[00:47:44.840 --> 00:47:47.440]   There's hundreds of thousands of apps that work fine
[00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:48.640]   and look fine.
[00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:50.520]   But there's only 100 apps that are written specifically
[00:47:50.520 --> 00:47:51.240]   for that screen size.
[00:47:51.240 --> 00:47:53.000]   But I don't expect you to see a lot of apps written
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:54.480]   for that screen size, because then that
[00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:55.520]   leaves out the rest of the mark.
[00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:56.160]   Turn it back around.
[00:47:56.160 --> 00:47:59.880]   That's the limitation of iOS, is that Steve does make you
[00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:00.520]   rewrite them.
[00:48:00.520 --> 00:48:01.040]   Yeah.
[00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:03.520]   You know, write these complicated double things.
[00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:05.440]   And on Android, it just works.
[00:48:05.440 --> 00:48:07.080]   Not to sound like a fanboy, but--
[00:48:07.080 --> 00:48:09.040]   Well, I think it's important.
[00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:09.640]   Love that.
[00:48:09.640 --> 00:48:11.200]   You know, people yell at me because I
[00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:14.160]   was critical of Steve's three big lies at the event.
[00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:17.000]   And look, if he lies, he lies.
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:18.400]   It doesn't mean I'm a Google fanboy.
[00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:19.840]   When Google lies, I get upset, too.
[00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:21.600]   If somebody's lying to you.
[00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:24.040]   And it is not our job to represent companies.
[00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:25.880]   We are here to represent end users.
[00:48:25.880 --> 00:48:29.640]   If a company's lying to you, you deserve to know that.
[00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:31.560]   Oh, he's attacking.
[00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:32.880]   He's attacking my team.
[00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:35.520]   I wish people would stop thinking of as a team sport.
[00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:36.040]   It's not--
[00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:37.080]   Me too.
[00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:37.600]   Me too.
[00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:40.160]   And if you're on a team, you're on the human team.
[00:48:40.160 --> 00:48:41.160]   Not the--
[00:48:41.160 --> 00:48:42.160]   You're on the consumer team.
[00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:43.160]   You're on the consumer team.
[00:48:43.160 --> 00:48:44.240]   You're on the consumer team.
[00:48:44.240 --> 00:48:45.440]   You're not on the big company team.
[00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:47.040]   You're on the consumer team.
[00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:49.520]   Remember which team you are on, friends.
[00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:50.040]   I've--
[00:48:50.040 --> 00:48:51.360]   Well, on team Leo.
[00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:51.880]   Well, no.
[00:48:51.880 --> 00:48:53.480]   You're not on my team.
[00:48:53.480 --> 00:48:54.840]   I don't want a team.
[00:48:54.840 --> 00:48:55.800]   Team Twig?
[00:48:55.800 --> 00:48:56.840]   Yeah, yeah, Twig is good.
[00:48:56.840 --> 00:48:59.880]   Team Twig, I'll go for that.
[00:48:59.880 --> 00:49:02.440]   New Google Maps navigation, the beta version
[00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:04.080]   will rat round traffic, something
[00:49:04.080 --> 00:49:07.640]   that GPS have done for some time.
[00:49:07.640 --> 00:49:08.480]   But hey, it's free.
[00:49:08.480 --> 00:49:09.360]   I didn't even know that.
[00:49:09.360 --> 00:49:10.360]   I've never used GPS.
[00:49:10.360 --> 00:49:11.560]   I've only used Google.
[00:49:11.560 --> 00:49:13.160]   Yeah, a lot of GPSes will do this.
[00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:14.880]   And I think that's a nice feature.
[00:49:14.880 --> 00:49:20.800]   I've seen it on some of the GPS software on iOS as well.
[00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:22.440]   Where do they get their traffic information?
[00:49:22.440 --> 00:49:23.840]   Where does Google get that information?
[00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:25.240]   That's what I'm wondering about.
[00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:26.920]   There's basically a monopoly now.
[00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:27.880]   Metro traffic and traffic.
[00:49:27.880 --> 00:49:28.840]   Oh, really?
[00:49:28.840 --> 00:49:29.320]   They don't?
[00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:33.200]   Same people who do it for radio are doing it for computers.
[00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:35.320]   And I actually think that the navigation app does send
[00:49:35.320 --> 00:49:37.160]   statistics to Google, if you let it, about your movement.
[00:49:37.160 --> 00:49:38.200]   That's what it should do.
[00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:38.760]   Yeah.
[00:49:38.760 --> 00:49:40.960]   I think it's gathering its own data as well, if I'm not
[00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:41.880]   mistaken, with your permission.
[00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:43.560]   That's where it's always been best.
[00:49:43.560 --> 00:49:44.560]   I have a--
[00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:44.960]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:45.560]   Your phone.
[00:49:45.560 --> 00:49:47.600]   It knows where you are, how fast you're moving.
[00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:49.160]   It doesn't need anything else.
[00:49:49.160 --> 00:49:51.520]   You're in a 65 miles an hour zone going through miles an hour.
[00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:52.240]   Send that back.
[00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:53.360]   That's the information we want.
[00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:55.160]   And it's up to date.
[00:49:55.160 --> 00:49:56.320]   You can date stamp it.
[00:49:56.320 --> 00:49:59.680]   And I had a little dash GPS.
[00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:00.400]   They went out of business.
[00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:01.800]   But that was a really cool idea.
[00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:06.640]   All the dash users were sending information back to dash
[00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:10.080]   and saying, so you had a very up-to-date traffic
[00:50:10.080 --> 00:50:10.400]   information.
[00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:11.400]   The problem is nobody bought it.
[00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:12.640]   So there was four of us.
[00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:17.360]   In 1995, I tried to convince Metro traffic and Shadow
[00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:19.160]   to do a very manual version of this,
[00:50:19.160 --> 00:50:21.840]   where it would be a data for data marketplace that you'd
[00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:24.360]   call in and report.
[00:50:24.360 --> 00:50:26.520]   For every time you called in to report a problem,
[00:50:26.520 --> 00:50:28.600]   you get a free report back when you needed it.
[00:50:28.600 --> 00:50:29.720]   Oh, great.
[00:50:29.720 --> 00:50:30.760]   They didn't do it.
[00:50:30.760 --> 00:50:31.520]   No, no.
[00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:34.760]   That's because you're an entrepreneurial journalist.
[00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:35.720]   Marissa Meyer--
[00:50:35.720 --> 00:50:37.880]   I think Marissa should send you a glimpse.
[00:50:37.880 --> 00:50:38.160]   You know what?
[00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:42.040]   That GLYMPSE app-- I love that app on Android and iOS,
[00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:43.000]   where you-- it sends you it.
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:44.240]   You've never seen this?
[00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:44.720]   No.
[00:50:44.720 --> 00:50:45.560]   All right, make my--
[00:50:45.560 --> 00:50:46.520]   GLYMPSE app.
[00:50:46.520 --> 00:50:47.440]   I'll make it my tool.
[00:50:47.440 --> 00:50:47.880]   I'll make it my tool.
[00:50:47.880 --> 00:50:48.720]   I'll make it my tool.
[00:50:48.720 --> 00:50:50.160]   I was going to do-- actually, I was
[00:50:50.160 --> 00:50:51.720]   going to do to do that-- to do text.
[00:50:51.720 --> 00:50:53.200]   Because, Gina, I've got it working.
[00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:55.240]   So I've done it before, so it's really not for you to do it
[00:50:55.240 --> 00:50:55.680]   again.
[00:50:55.680 --> 00:50:57.000]   But I've got it working so sweetly.
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:50:57.560]   You were right.
[00:50:57.560 --> 00:51:00.160]   I don't use the text file in Geek Tool now.
[00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:02.200]   I just use the shell command.
[00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:03.560]   And it just-- it works so--
[00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:05.880]   oh, I can't pull it up.
[00:51:05.880 --> 00:51:07.080]   I got my thing done.
[00:51:07.080 --> 00:51:08.640]   But it works so nicely.
[00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:10.240]   And I've got-- I use Quicksilver
[00:51:10.240 --> 00:51:12.280]   to automatically-- of Cuc's keystrokes
[00:51:12.280 --> 00:51:13.400]   send it new to-do stuff.
[00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:16.240]   It's always on my desktop of all my computers.
[00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:18.960]   You are my-- like, you are my target user, Leo.
[00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:19.680]   You are--
[00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:20.640]   It's awesome.
[00:51:20.640 --> 00:51:22.040]   Can't tell you how happy this makes me.
[00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:23.480]   Oh, well, you did a great job.
[00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:26.520]   And I can't tell you how grateful I am to you for making it.
[00:51:26.520 --> 00:51:27.080]   Yay.
[00:51:27.080 --> 00:51:28.280]   So happy to hear that.
[00:51:28.280 --> 00:51:29.000]   It's really neat.
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:31.960]   So for those who don't know, todotext.com,
[00:51:31.960 --> 00:51:36.160]   todotext.com, it's a little geeky.
[00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:37.040]   It is.
[00:51:37.040 --> 00:51:37.760]   It's a lot geeky.
[00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:40.520]   It's basically command line to-do lists.
[00:51:40.520 --> 00:51:41.960]   Yeah, that's why we want to do a GUI.
[00:51:41.960 --> 00:51:43.360]   That's why I want to make a Chrome web app.
[00:51:43.360 --> 00:51:44.640]   Well, there's a great Android app.
[00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:46.360]   So that makes-- the Android app, you could do everything
[00:51:46.360 --> 00:51:48.200]   you would do in a normal to-do thing.
[00:51:48.200 --> 00:51:49.680]   But because it makes it--
[00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:51.440]   you know, because it makes a text file which you would then
[00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:55.440]   put in Dropbox, it's so great.
[00:51:55.440 --> 00:51:57.960]   And you can always find apps that interact with text files.
[00:51:57.960 --> 00:52:01.160]   So it's not like Quicksilver appending to the file
[00:52:01.160 --> 00:52:03.120]   makes it so easy to add to my to-do list.
[00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:04.240]   And it's always on my desktop.
[00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:05.440]   I just love that.
[00:52:05.440 --> 00:52:05.920]   Awesome.
[00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:06.640]   I don't know.
[00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:07.960]   I just did an ad for you.
[00:52:07.960 --> 00:52:08.760]   I know.
[00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:10.560]   I'll send you the text to mail.
[00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:11.360]   Text in the mail.
[00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:12.720]   It's in the Android marketplace.
[00:52:12.720 --> 00:52:16.440]   It's guaranteed malware free to do.
[00:52:16.440 --> 00:52:18.520]   What do you call it in the Android marketplace?
[00:52:18.520 --> 00:52:20.080]   Todo.textTouch.
[00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:21.440]   Todo.textTouch.
[00:52:21.440 --> 00:52:22.600]   I know it's a terrible name.
[00:52:22.600 --> 00:52:23.440]   I'm not good at names.
[00:52:23.440 --> 00:52:24.280]   It's a truly engineering--
[00:52:24.280 --> 00:52:25.920]   You need branding help, do you know?
[00:52:25.920 --> 00:52:27.320]   But just so you know, just so you know,
[00:52:27.320 --> 00:52:28.040]   I'm not making it up.
[00:52:28.040 --> 00:52:30.720]   There it is right there, right on the front page
[00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:32.640]   of my next SS.
[00:52:32.640 --> 00:52:34.040]   And what do you have to do list?
[00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:35.440]   Lots of stuff.
[00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:36.640]   Let's see here.
[00:52:36.640 --> 00:52:37.440]   Make a Dennis appointment.
[00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:37.440]   Nice.
[00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:38.440]   I like that.
[00:52:38.440 --> 00:52:40.320]   You can tell you're using it like next actions.
[00:52:40.320 --> 00:52:41.520]   I got prioritization.
[00:52:41.520 --> 00:52:43.160]   Amber is going to call you.
[00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:43.680]   Yeah.
[00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:44.440]   Amber's going to call.
[00:52:44.440 --> 00:52:46.600]   I'm going to get paid checks for mail.
[00:52:46.600 --> 00:52:50.560]   So that's Dr. Mom, who for my wife's birthday in September
[00:52:50.560 --> 00:52:53.920]   made her a necklace, which I still owe her $60 for.
[00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:55.720]   Sometimes just putting it on the to-do list
[00:52:55.720 --> 00:52:57.000]   doesn't mean it gets done.
[00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:57.360]   Yeah.
[00:52:57.360 --> 00:52:58.840]   That's my tell.
[00:52:58.840 --> 00:52:59.680]   No, but you know what?
[00:52:59.680 --> 00:53:02.040]   That list was a lot longer yesterday, so it doesn't work.
[00:53:02.040 --> 00:53:03.600]   Couple of acquisitions from Google,
[00:53:03.600 --> 00:53:06.400]   and we're going to get to your tips, tools, and numbers.
[00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:10.880]   Google bought a British price comparison site
[00:53:10.880 --> 00:53:14.520]   called BeatThatQuot.com.
[00:53:14.520 --> 00:53:17.200]   Yes, it's time to play BeatThatQuot.com.
[00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:19.080]   I never heard of them, but they are British.
[00:53:19.080 --> 00:53:25.280]   167-- I'm sorry, $61 million, 167 pounds or something.
[00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:27.000]   Oh, no, I'm sorry, 37 pounds.
[00:53:29.480 --> 00:53:31.120]   They're going to use that technology
[00:53:31.120 --> 00:53:34.520]   to provide new ways for consumers to find the right financial
[00:53:34.520 --> 00:53:36.640]   products.
[00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:41.800]   So it's price quotes on money.
[00:53:41.800 --> 00:53:42.440]   Hmm.
[00:53:42.440 --> 00:53:45.720]   They also bought-- and this was rumored for a long time--
[00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:48.040]   YouTube bought Next New Networks, which
[00:53:48.040 --> 00:53:51.360]   is a content big YouTube content production company
[00:53:51.360 --> 00:53:53.000]   with something like 60 producers,
[00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:57.000]   including the Gregory Brothers and Too Hot For Words,
[00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:58.200]   or whatever that thing is called.
[00:53:58.200 --> 00:54:04.240]   And interesting play for YouTube to become a content creator.
[00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:05.680]   Well, that's the issue.
[00:54:05.680 --> 00:54:09.560]   So I talked to Fred Seibert, who founded Next New Networks.
[00:54:09.560 --> 00:54:12.560]   I was a friend before this, when he had to wink at me a lot.
[00:54:12.560 --> 00:54:16.120]   But I said my concern is that if Google finds itself
[00:54:16.120 --> 00:54:18.760]   in the content business, it's in huge channel conflict.
[00:54:18.760 --> 00:54:20.520]   It just can't do that.
[00:54:20.520 --> 00:54:23.160]   And the wink is-- and the press release made this too--
[00:54:23.160 --> 00:54:26.080]   they're going to take the shows that Next New Networks owns
[00:54:26.080 --> 00:54:29.840]   and put some kind of wall around them or do something with them.
[00:54:29.840 --> 00:54:30.960]   That's not why they bought it.
[00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:35.000]   They bought it for a platform to create better content.
[00:54:35.000 --> 00:54:35.560]   And I think that's--
[00:54:35.560 --> 00:54:38.600]   No, how or is there some technology as well?
[00:54:38.600 --> 00:54:42.720]   Technology, but also, I think, more systems and structure
[00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:43.200]   to do that.
[00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:45.680]   I'm not sure exactly what that is.
[00:54:45.680 --> 00:54:48.400]   But that's in YouTube's interest to have better content.
[00:54:48.400 --> 00:54:50.080]   YouTube, as you know a week ago-- I
[00:54:50.080 --> 00:54:51.520]   think we talked about this last week--
[00:54:51.520 --> 00:54:55.680]   is paying hundreds of producers, six figures,
[00:54:55.680 --> 00:55:00.120]   a year, and thousands of producers, five figures a year
[00:55:00.120 --> 00:55:02.280]   in compensation.
[00:55:02.280 --> 00:55:04.000]   So people are going to start to make a living at this.
[00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:06.320]   And the more of that there is, the more things
[00:55:06.320 --> 00:55:08.960]   we watch instead of Bigel Network TV,
[00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:10.680]   the better it is for YouTube and Google.
[00:55:10.680 --> 00:55:12.160]   So that's what's in their interest.
[00:55:12.160 --> 00:55:18.080]   But owning shows and competing with their own distribution
[00:55:18.080 --> 00:55:20.800]   platform would bring up all kinds of problems
[00:55:20.800 --> 00:55:23.600]   with people saying that there is the discussions we've had
[00:55:23.600 --> 00:55:26.520]   is YouTube favoring its own stuff.
[00:55:26.520 --> 00:55:27.720]   And things like that.
[00:55:27.720 --> 00:55:29.680]   So I think that they can't--
[00:55:29.680 --> 00:55:30.760]   I hope the case is.
[00:55:30.760 --> 00:55:32.640]   I really hope the case is that they
[00:55:32.640 --> 00:55:36.080]   find a way to slough off that original content and not own it.
[00:55:36.080 --> 00:55:36.920]   Yeah.
[00:55:36.920 --> 00:55:38.600]   It's interesting they brought it for workflow.
[00:55:38.600 --> 00:55:40.080]   That's what Devorek always told me.
[00:55:40.080 --> 00:55:41.160]   He said, work on your workflow.
[00:55:41.160 --> 00:55:42.960]   That's what people buy.
[00:55:42.960 --> 00:55:44.600]   They don't care about the content.
[00:55:44.600 --> 00:55:46.840]   They want the workflow.
[00:55:46.840 --> 00:55:47.640]   That's my bad impression.
[00:55:47.640 --> 00:55:48.760]   No idea what that means.
[00:55:48.760 --> 00:55:49.600]   But yes, John.
[00:55:49.600 --> 00:55:50.080]   Yes, John.
[00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:50.600]   Yes, John.
[00:55:50.600 --> 00:55:51.520]   I didn't even--
[00:55:51.520 --> 00:55:52.480]   I didn't even-- anyway.
[00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:53.000]   What did they get?
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:55.320]   They got like 30 million, something like that, 50 million.
[00:55:55.320 --> 00:55:56.280]   I heard somebody 50.
[00:55:56.280 --> 00:55:59.320]   I think there was 26 into it.
[00:55:59.320 --> 00:56:03.240]   It was a problem of trying to find ad sales.
[00:56:03.240 --> 00:56:03.920]   Ad sales are tough.
[00:56:03.920 --> 00:56:04.600]   That's what they were doing.
[00:56:04.600 --> 00:56:07.200]   Yes, it is.
[00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:09.360]   The newest Google website, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:56:09.360 --> 00:56:15.200]   are you ready for official royal wedding 2011.org?
[00:56:15.200 --> 00:56:16.160]   Are we sick of it yet?
[00:56:16.160 --> 00:56:16.680]   It hasn't happened.
[00:56:16.680 --> 00:56:17.240]   It hasn't happened.
[00:56:17.240 --> 00:56:20.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:56:20.760 --> 00:56:21.720]   This is Google.
[00:56:21.720 --> 00:56:23.560]   They're using Google for this.
[00:56:23.560 --> 00:56:26.600]   I mean, I actually felt grateful to Sheen
[00:56:26.600 --> 00:56:29.560]   for reducing the royal wedding media coverage
[00:56:29.560 --> 00:56:31.840]   for a little bit there for a while.
[00:56:31.840 --> 00:56:34.400]   Oh, you ain't seen nothing yet, baby.
[00:56:34.400 --> 00:56:37.400]   So it's Google App Engine that they're using for the--
[00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:39.280]   I mean, I guess they wanted bandwidth galore.
[00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:41.600]   I don't know.
[00:56:41.600 --> 00:56:43.320]   Yeah, that makes sense.
[00:56:43.320 --> 00:56:44.000]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:47.320]   Not Squarespace, not WordPress, not TypePad.
[00:56:47.320 --> 00:56:51.600]   I'm sure they all would love to have had that big old website.
[00:56:51.600 --> 00:56:52.600]   Hey.
[00:56:52.600 --> 00:56:53.600]   Hey.
[00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:56.880]   Hey, Charlie Sheen couldn't kill you stream.
[00:56:56.880 --> 00:56:57.760]   That's pretty good for them.
[00:56:57.760 --> 00:57:00.520]   You streamed on TV, 200,000 views.
[00:57:00.520 --> 00:57:03.600]   Did you see Charlie's last broadcast last night?
[00:57:03.600 --> 00:57:05.800]   You know, he's sick.
[00:57:05.800 --> 00:57:09.880]   The man is sick, and it's getting worse and worse,
[00:57:09.880 --> 00:57:12.000]   or watching him destroy himself in public.
[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:14.120]   It's not nice to watch that.
[00:57:14.120 --> 00:57:15.720]   But--
[00:57:15.720 --> 00:57:16.560]   Nor--
[00:57:16.560 --> 00:57:18.760]   Jake, update from Jake.
[00:57:18.760 --> 00:57:20.880]   He just said that Sheen said he needs help.
[00:57:20.880 --> 00:57:21.760]   Oh, good.
[00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:23.840]   Where do you say that, Jake?
[00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:25.080]   Some type of one.
[00:57:25.080 --> 00:57:27.360]   Yeah, well, true.
[00:57:27.360 --> 00:57:29.720]   And not just a social media intern to help him.
[00:57:29.720 --> 00:57:31.760]   I think he needs help doing his Twitter.
[00:57:31.760 --> 00:57:33.520]   Did you see how many applications he got?
[00:57:33.520 --> 00:57:34.360]   How many?
[00:57:34.360 --> 00:57:36.280]   42,000 applications for the social media--
[00:57:36.280 --> 00:57:37.280]   Why not?
[00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:39.800]   If he's going to put 18 point stars up in the house,
[00:57:39.800 --> 00:57:41.120]   I mean, why as well?
[00:57:41.120 --> 00:57:42.440]   70,000 applications.
[00:57:42.440 --> 00:57:46.960]   I want to be in the Charlie Sheen new media consultant house.
[00:57:46.960 --> 00:57:49.400]   Is it next to the porn star house?
[00:57:49.400 --> 00:57:52.840]   Warner Brothers starts running movies on Facebook.
[00:57:52.840 --> 00:57:54.560]   They deal.
[00:57:54.560 --> 00:57:55.800]   Wow, it's the Dark Knight.
[00:57:55.800 --> 00:57:58.680]   You have to actually go to the Dark Knight page on Facebook
[00:57:58.680 --> 00:57:59.920]   to rent the movie.
[00:57:59.920 --> 00:58:02.240]   It's a very interesting nexus.
[00:58:02.240 --> 00:58:05.400]   And it's not in here, but Facebook is now doing comments
[00:58:05.400 --> 00:58:05.840]   as well.
[00:58:05.840 --> 00:58:07.440]   And I'm very tempted to use their comment engine.
[00:58:07.440 --> 00:58:09.120]   I saw that TechCrunch is thrilled with it.
[00:58:09.120 --> 00:58:10.480]   I guess we talked about that last week.
[00:58:10.480 --> 00:58:10.880]   Yeah, we did.
[00:58:10.880 --> 00:58:11.360]   Yep.
[00:58:11.360 --> 00:58:12.080]   I can never remember.
[00:58:12.080 --> 00:58:13.120]   There was controversy there.
[00:58:13.120 --> 00:58:15.040]   I wrote a piece on my blog.
[00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:17.480]   I took a snippet out of the book about the argument
[00:58:17.480 --> 00:58:19.120]   about anonymity and how we ought to have more
[00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:19.920]   than one identity.
[00:58:19.920 --> 00:58:23.000]   And I side with Zuckerberg that we have one identity.
[00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:24.560]   Facebook.
[00:58:24.560 --> 00:58:26.920]   That's the Facebook web.
[00:58:26.920 --> 00:58:27.760]   Well, look, this is Facebook.
[00:58:27.760 --> 00:58:29.440]   You side with Zuckerberg?
[00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:30.800]   That necessarily Facebook's.
[00:58:30.800 --> 00:58:31.840]   But we have our own.
[00:58:31.840 --> 00:58:34.400]   I like the new Google profiles.
[00:58:34.400 --> 00:58:37.720]   I don't know how I get it or don't get it, but I like it.
[00:58:37.720 --> 00:58:39.640]   We talked about the new Google profile search
[00:58:39.640 --> 00:58:41.040]   and now we realize where that came from.
[00:58:41.040 --> 00:58:42.800]   It came from the new Google profiles.
[00:58:42.800 --> 00:58:43.960]   Yeah, I haven't done it yet.
[00:58:43.960 --> 00:58:44.880]   I would update it by age.
[00:58:44.880 --> 00:58:47.160]   Yeah, profiles.google.com.
[00:58:47.160 --> 00:58:48.280]   I don't know.
[00:58:48.280 --> 00:58:49.320]   Sometimes I get the old one.
[00:58:49.320 --> 00:58:50.400]   Sometimes I get the new one.
[00:58:50.400 --> 00:58:53.960]   I don't know if something with my cookies or whatever.
[00:58:53.960 --> 00:58:56.040]   Yeah, it's a real nice update.
[00:58:56.040 --> 00:58:57.560]   More bits of information.
[00:58:57.560 --> 00:58:59.880]   They took away the Flickr integration, which bummed me out
[00:58:59.880 --> 00:59:01.920]   because that made me happy because I used Flickr
[00:59:01.920 --> 00:59:05.400]   and I thought it was a nice use of another company's API.
[00:59:05.400 --> 00:59:08.080]   But that said, the layout is really nice.
[00:59:08.080 --> 00:59:09.560]   More questions, more links.
[00:59:09.560 --> 00:59:11.320]   But don't you think it's a little bit
[00:59:11.320 --> 00:59:13.920]   Facebook-y, for instance, here when you change your information,
[00:59:13.920 --> 00:59:16.160]   you could put location, birthday, relationship,
[00:59:16.160 --> 00:59:17.920]   and gender under your picture.
[00:59:17.920 --> 00:59:20.920]   Yes, that's Facebook-y, isn't it?
[00:59:20.920 --> 00:59:22.400]   It is very Facebook-y.
[00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:25.320]   I had our long rant about those drop downs.
[00:59:25.320 --> 00:59:26.320]   Yeah.
[00:59:26.320 --> 00:59:28.400]   If Larry Page creates a page for his dog,
[00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:29.640]   then we know that it's a war.
[00:59:29.640 --> 00:59:30.240]   Right.
[00:59:30.240 --> 00:59:32.160]   Buzz is still on here, although you can finally
[00:59:32.160 --> 00:59:34.640]   turn off the Buzz tab.
[00:59:34.640 --> 00:59:36.560]   Let's not show my personal information.
[00:59:36.560 --> 00:59:38.480]   You can choose the pictures here, finally,
[00:59:38.480 --> 00:59:41.560]   at least a little bit more granularly than you could before.
[00:59:41.560 --> 00:59:44.720]   You can manage those photos a little bit better.
[00:59:44.720 --> 00:59:45.720]   I like it.
[00:59:45.720 --> 00:59:47.240]   I think it's a nice looking profile.
[00:59:47.240 --> 00:59:49.360]   See, that's kind of what made me think of this
[00:59:49.360 --> 00:59:51.640]   when you talked about Mark saying you should have one place
[00:59:51.640 --> 00:59:52.160]   on the web.
[00:59:52.160 --> 00:59:53.160]   I don't know if you should have only one,
[00:59:53.160 --> 00:59:54.160]   but you should at least have something like this.
[00:59:54.160 --> 00:59:55.640]   No, he wasn't saying that you were saying
[00:59:55.640 --> 00:59:58.520]   that you don't separate your work identity from your home
[00:59:58.520 --> 01:00:00.200]   identity from your this identity from that identity,
[01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:01.480]   because they're going to come into conflict.
[01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:01.680]   Right.
[01:00:01.680 --> 01:00:03.640]   Better off than have one identity and be yourself.
[01:00:03.640 --> 01:00:04.360]   Be yourself.
[01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:06.440]   This is who I am.
[01:00:06.440 --> 01:00:08.720]   I'm CEO, bitch.
[01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:10.480]   And he lives that, actually.
[01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:11.920]   That's--
[01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:13.800]   For those who think I was unnecessarily profane,
[01:00:13.800 --> 01:00:16.960]   that actually was his business card, and all of it still is.
[01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:19.320]   Gizmo 5, just an update, shutting down April 3.
[01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:21.280]   You can transfer your credits to Google Voice.
[01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:24.920]   Google bought Gizmo and finally dropped the other shoe
[01:00:24.920 --> 01:00:25.520]   on their head.
[01:00:25.520 --> 01:00:31.080]   I think we should get to our tool number and tip.
[01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:33.000]   I know you've got to get going to see Marissa.
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:33.760]   I should not.
[01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:34.800]   And Tim.
[01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:37.120]   And we'll find out more about Kevin Lynch and your lunch
[01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:38.760]   with him and Marissa and Tim next week.
[01:00:38.760 --> 01:00:39.760]   How about that?
[01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:40.800]   That's good.
[01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:44.560]   Gina Travana, your tip of the week.
[01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:48.640]   Gmail added a new feature in labs called Smart Labels.
[01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:51.040]   So I think this is kind of like a way to jumpstart folks who
[01:00:51.040 --> 01:00:53.360]   aren't using filters and labels very much.
[01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:56.240]   If you enable Smart Labels in your Gmail account,
[01:00:56.240 --> 01:00:59.880]   the labs link, it automatically creates categories
[01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:02.880]   for a bulk called-- there's actually three labels--
[01:01:02.880 --> 01:01:05.240]   bulk, notification, and forum messages.
[01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:08.480]   And these are just filters that look to see,
[01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:10.600]   is this just a newsletter or subscription?
[01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:13.720]   Is this a mailing list, a subscription,
[01:01:13.720 --> 01:01:16.240]   and a kind of promotional email and filters them
[01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:17.720]   into those labels automatically?
[01:01:17.720 --> 01:01:18.880]   I like that.
[01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:20.320]   I knew that.
[01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:21.160]   Yeah, it's nice.
[01:01:21.160 --> 01:01:22.600]   I had many of these filters.
[01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:25.760]   I kind of created them by hand that serve a similar purpose.
[01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:27.600]   But this is really for folks who hadn't had a chance
[01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:31.160]   to do that or wanted to just kind of get a kickstart
[01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:32.080]   on their labels.
[01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:33.480]   And once you enable Smart Labels,
[01:01:33.480 --> 01:01:35.080]   you can go into your filter settings
[01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:35.840]   and you can tweak them.
[01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:38.320]   You can add addresses and the other criteria too
[01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:41.400]   that you'll see the Smart Label filter listed there.
[01:01:41.400 --> 01:01:42.840]   They've changed the UI.
[01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:44.880]   It looks like I now have a gear for the options.
[01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:46.480]   So I was looking for the labs link
[01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:48.480]   and you have to click the gear now
[01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:50.480]   in the upper right hand corner of Gmail.
[01:01:50.480 --> 01:01:52.280]   And then you can get to the settings.
[01:01:52.280 --> 01:01:54.680]   And then you can get to the labs.
[01:01:54.680 --> 01:01:56.120]   And then you can go to labs, right?
[01:01:56.120 --> 01:01:58.040]   And they haven't nothing that in Google Apps yet.
[01:01:58.040 --> 01:01:59.000]   So I hadn't seen that yet.
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:00.080]   Yeah, that's interesting.
[01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:00.560]   It's cleaner.
[01:02:00.560 --> 01:02:02.640]   That's how they should be that way.
[01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:03.080]   Yep.
[01:02:03.080 --> 01:02:06.040]   And it's Smart Labels, one word, like Wikiword.
[01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:09.360]   So I'll go way down because it's alphabetic.
[01:02:09.360 --> 01:02:11.640]   So many labs features, it's crazy.
[01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:12.960]   Well, and these are all my enabled ones.
[01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:14.760]   So they have to go down to the disables.
[01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:21.120]   Smart Mute, Smart Labels, fan freaking tastic.
[01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:25.200]   Turning on now, saving changes now.
[01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:25.640]   Good tip.
[01:02:25.640 --> 01:02:26.360]   Thank you, Gina.
[01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:27.360]   Yeah, sure.
[01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:29.680]   Jeff, your number of the week.
[01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:33.080]   Well, the obvious one is Fortune's Most Abired Companies,
[01:02:33.080 --> 01:02:35.480]   Apple Google 1.2.
[01:02:35.480 --> 01:02:39.880]   But I'll do another number, which is 2,127, which is Henry
[01:02:39.880 --> 01:02:42.840]   Blodgett's profit last year for Business Insider.
[01:02:42.840 --> 01:02:43.200]   What?
[01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:44.200]   How much?
[01:02:44.200 --> 01:02:45.400]   What's 2,127?
[01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:47.520]   I mean, $2,127.
[01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:48.600]   That's all?
[01:02:48.600 --> 01:02:50.440]   Well, but he made a profit.
[01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:53.000]   And as he said, it's better than not having $2,127.
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.360]   Made a lot more a jiggering the stock market.
[01:02:55.360 --> 01:02:58.560]   And yeah, you said it.
[01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:00.040]   Yeah, I probably shouldn't say that.
[01:03:00.040 --> 01:03:01.160]   I don't know anything.
[01:03:01.160 --> 01:03:02.160]   I know nothing.
[01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:02.440]   No.
[01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:04.080]   Well, Henry did what I liked, because he
[01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:06.560]   would have had to release his financials, put him right out
[01:03:06.560 --> 01:03:07.080]   there.
[01:03:07.080 --> 01:03:10.440]   So he made about $4.5 million in ad revenue.
[01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:11.280]   And do you think that's higher?
[01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:12.400]   Well, 40 house.
[01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:15.280]   $4.5 million is about right, I would say.
[01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:15.960]   Yeah, I'd say.
[01:03:15.960 --> 01:03:16.920]   That's right where we are.
[01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:18.480]   We're right in that area.
[01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:19.920]   Yeah, and he's investing in the business.
[01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:22.400]   And you know, you're just as transparent as Henry is,
[01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:23.160]   you're putting that out.
[01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:24.320]   I'm assuming you're great.
[01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:25.400]   So he reinvested--
[01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:27.080]   So it wasn't that he didn't have revenue.
[01:03:27.080 --> 01:03:29.040]   It's just that he didn't take anything out of it.
[01:03:29.040 --> 01:03:30.320]   He invested back in the business.
[01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:31.240]   That's somebody told me that.
[01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:34.040]   You should always tell people you made $5 profit.
[01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:34.720]   Yeah.
[01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:37.360]   Because your salary is part of the cost.
[01:03:37.360 --> 01:03:39.200]   Well, you're also telling the IRS that.
[01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:41.080]   Yeah, I mean, yeah, I always at the end of the year,
[01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:43.640]   I got $5 left in my pocket.
[01:03:43.640 --> 01:03:46.920]   Well, mention the savings account in Zurich.
[01:03:46.920 --> 01:03:48.440]   I guess it's OK to say that because I
[01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:51.440]   see that he can still his ban from the securities industry.
[01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:52.480]   He's found--
[01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:53.560]   He's an open about that.
[01:03:53.560 --> 01:03:54.760]   He'll ask about it.
[01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:55.680]   He'll talk about it.
[01:03:55.680 --> 01:03:56.760]   What happened?
[01:03:56.760 --> 01:03:58.120]   Yeah.
[01:03:58.120 --> 01:04:01.520]   And my tool of the week, I already forgot it.
[01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:03.920]   She never mind-- G-T-G-L.
[01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:04.440]   G-L.
[01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:05.800]   Oh, thank you.
[01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:09.480]   So we're on our way to a South by Southwest, right?
[01:04:09.480 --> 01:04:12.560]   And John Aslinina is driving the van.
[01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:13.760]   He left on Monday.
[01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:15.300]   So how do we know where John is?
[01:04:15.300 --> 01:04:16.680]   Well, he glimpsed us.
[01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:20.360]   This is available on Android and iPhone.
[01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:22.740]   When I was late for our Google appointment, I glimpsed--
[01:04:22.740 --> 01:04:26.240]   I sent a text message to Karen Wickry that linked to this map.
[01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:29.760]   Now, she can see where I am in real time.
[01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:31.280]   In fact, let me zoom in.
[01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:33.680]   She probably could know it anyway, Leo, because she's at Google.
[01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:36.840]   Well, she probably knows everything, doesn't she?
[01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:38.920]   She's tracking you anyway.
[01:04:38.920 --> 01:04:40.080]   But this is a cool way to share.
[01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:40.760]   It looks like he--
[01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:40.760]   --the Google--
[01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:42.200]   --by the way.
[01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:45.680]   For one thing, we know that he took a tour of Carl's Bad Caverns.
[01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:48.000]   There's a little detour on there.
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.720]   But you see that?
[01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:50.720]   It's so funny.
[01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:51.760]   You see that in real time.
[01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:54.760]   So if you're in real time, you can actually see how fast he's
[01:04:54.760 --> 01:04:55.760]   going.
[01:04:55.760 --> 01:04:57.360]   There's the detour.
[01:04:57.360 --> 01:04:59.280]   He's coming back now.
[01:04:59.280 --> 01:05:00.880]   That's going to freak people out.
[01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:02.760]   He's going 54 miles an hour.
[01:05:02.760 --> 01:05:05.600]   And so he's coming back in the Carl's Bad Cavern Highway.
[01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:07.360]   That's so funny.
[01:05:07.360 --> 01:05:09.320]   So this is in real time.
[01:05:09.320 --> 01:05:11.960]   You said, how long the glimpse will last for if you're late
[01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:14.520]   a lot, as I am, as you know.
[01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:15.960]   You just send people a glimpse.
[01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:16.720]   It's a text message.
[01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:21.560]   Then they have a live real time map that will tell you exactly
[01:05:21.560 --> 01:05:26.480]   where-- tell them exactly where you are at all times.
[01:05:26.480 --> 01:05:28.840]   Now what you want is tie that with Street View,
[01:05:28.840 --> 01:05:30.480]   so you can see what he's seen.
[01:05:30.480 --> 01:05:32.080]   Wouldn't that be cool?
[01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:33.960]   This is such a neat product.
[01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:36.360]   I just think it's so, so cool.
[01:05:36.360 --> 01:05:37.360]   G.L.Y.
[01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:38.520]   It's something mesmerizing about it.
[01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:38.880]   Oh, yeah.
[01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:41.000]   I first discovered it when Robert Scobble was late for
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:41.920]   Twitt and he sent me a glimpse.
[01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:42.960]   And we watched him arrive.
[01:05:42.960 --> 01:05:44.240]   I watched him pull up out front.
[01:05:44.240 --> 01:05:46.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:05:46.760 --> 01:05:48.040]   That's so Scobble.
[01:05:48.040 --> 01:05:48.440]   I guess he--
[01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:51.160]   Yes, that's so Scobble.
[01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:53.400]   G-L-Y-M-P-S-E.com.
[01:05:53.400 --> 01:05:55.720]   We'll be in Austin this weekend.
[01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:56.360]   Can't believe it.
[01:05:56.360 --> 01:05:57.560]   Can't wait.
[01:05:57.560 --> 01:05:59.040]   Jeff and Gina and I.
[01:05:59.040 --> 01:06:02.240]   And we'll see you Sunday afternoon, about 5 o'clock.
[01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:03.640]   On the state of Momos.
[01:06:03.640 --> 01:06:04.800]   Please come early.
[01:06:04.800 --> 01:06:05.800]   We'll be there.
[01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:07.040]   We can be there at 4.30.
[01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:07.840]   Well, I'm not talking about you.
[01:06:07.840 --> 01:06:09.120]   You guys get where whenever you want.
[01:06:09.120 --> 01:06:10.600]   But if you're going to be in the audience,
[01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:12.720]   there's only room for 500.
[01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:14.320]   And I have a feeling we'll fill up fast.
[01:06:14.320 --> 01:06:15.080]   So come early.
[01:06:15.080 --> 01:06:15.560]   We still--
[01:06:15.560 --> 01:06:15.880]   Oh, boy.
[01:06:15.880 --> 01:06:17.400]   --door is open at 1.
[01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:18.440]   That's going to be some party.
[01:06:18.440 --> 01:06:19.440]   Yeah!
[01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:20.440]   Yeah!
[01:06:20.440 --> 01:06:21.360]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:23.440]   We'll see you next time on Twig.
[01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:26.440]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:29.480]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:32.520]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:06:32.520 --> 01:06:35.100]   (guitar music)
