[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360]   It's time for Twig. This week in Google Jeff Jarvis is here.
[00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.080]   Aunt Pruitt and Kevin Tofel.
[00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:11.040]   We're going to talk about the new Google Music and how it all works through YouTube Music.
[00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.660]   Don't be evil. It's no longer Google's motto.
[00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.600]   Does that make any difference?
[00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.560]   And inside Facebook's Deletion Center in Berlin.
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.040]   It's all coming up next on Twig.
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.400]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.080]   Netcast you love.
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.240]   From people you trust.
[00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.520]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.040]   This is Twig.
[00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:41.200]   Bandwidth for this week in Google is provided by CashFly, C-A-C-H-E-F-L-Y.com.
[00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.200]   [MUSIC]
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.680]   This is Twig. This week in Google.
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.840]   Episode 458 recorded Wednesday, May 23rd, 2018.
[00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.360]   The Queen in Green.
[00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.920]   This week in Google is brought to you by Rocket Mortgage from Quick and Loans.
[00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.640]   Home plays a big role in your life.
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.280]   That's why Quick and Loans created Rocket Mortgage.
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.120]   It lets you apply simply and understand the entire mortgage process fully.
[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.760]   So you can be confident you're getting the right mortgage for you.
[00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.480]   Get started at rocketmortgage.com/twig.
[00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:15.920]   It's time for Twig.
[00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.720]   This week in Google, we got a great panel.
[00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.280]   We're going to have some fun today.
[00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.640]   Jeff Jarvis is here in his office.
[00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.440]   It's nice to have you.
[00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.360]   Is that a newspaper news delivery bag behind you?
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.240]   No, it's from VidCon.
[00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.880]   Oh, be critical of the media you love.
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.760]   See, I was hoping it was like a paper boys bag.
[00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:37.440]   That would be good.
[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.400]   I have one in the home somewhere.
[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.200]   Yeah, I have one for the New York mirror, I think.
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.760]   Another classic.
[00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.720]   Jeff, how's it going today?
[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.760]   The paper that I had no tomorrow.
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.640]   Jeff is a professor of journalism at the City University of New York
[00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.560]   and still remembers how a typewriter smells.
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.560]   Also, Stacy has the week off, but guess who's here in your place?
[00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.880]   Her good friend and co-partner in podcasting, Mr. Kevin Toefull.
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.440]   Also, Kevin's new website, which you got a big scoop about crumbooks.com.
[00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.800]   We'll talk about that.
[00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:11.960]   Just today.
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:12.360]   Yeah.
[00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.720]   Big scoop.
[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.800]   And we're thrilled to have Aunt Pruitt back on.
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:17.800]   Yay!
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.880]   He's a contributor tech republic.
[00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:27.080]   He is a great photographer, drone pilot, and Friday night video guy on YouTube.
[00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.720]   So, Aunt, is that computer or next to you?
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.240]   Actually, just like Steve Gibson's shelves, it's just a prop with lights on it.
[00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.960]   Oh, buddy, this is a tool, not a prop.
[00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.560]   We had to make him turn it off the last time he was on because it was so noisy.
[00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.160]   It was so really, the fans are so loud.
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.800]   All these fans in this thing.
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.440]   But I think I got you squared away now.
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.440]   Sounds great.
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.800]   It's a little closer to my pipes.
[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.000]   That's all it needs to be.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.120]   Just get that sound, man.
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.080]   You need a liquid-cool chair next to that thing.
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.760]   Liquid-cool chair.
[00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:57.760]   I love it.
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.280]   Always good to have all three of you on.
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.280]   Talk about the week's news.
[00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.960]   And there's a breaking story, which somebody I think was Aunt mentioned, that just came
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.120]   in.
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.720]   The town night, no, not the town night.
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:11.720]   You're the town night.
[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.640]   The first amendment instituted Columbia University.
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:16.640]   sued.
[00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:18.840]   This is the weirdest thing I've ever heard of.
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:24.960]   sued President Trump on behalf of eight people who he had blocked on Twitter.
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:31.360]   The premise, which, well, the premise is that the president of the United States shouldn't
[00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:34.040]   be able to block people.
[00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.520]   And the judge has just ruled that's correct.
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:42.440]   And Naomi Rice Bookwald of the US District Court for the Southern District of New York
[00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:48.560]   said President Trump's Twitter account is a public forum and blocking people who reply
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.800]   to his tweets with differing opinions constitutes viewpoint discrimination.
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:58.840]   That's a violation of the first amendment.
[00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:04.960]   That is just bizarre that we've come to this point in the world where this is a heavy-duty
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.400]   issue.
[00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:13.080]   What's interesting is, and she wrote a 75 page opinion on this, he could have ignored the
[00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.640]   reply tweets.
[00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:20.280]   She says that's not unconstitutional, but you can, in other words, you can mute them,
[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.640]   but you can't block them.
[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:26.560]   She said, muting preserves the muted accounts ability to reply to a tweet sent by the muting
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:27.720]   account.
[00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:29.320]   Blocking says you can't reply.
[00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.120]   Not only, and that is a distinction.
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.720]   The block user can neither see nor reply to block users' tweets entirely.
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.480]   Muting means you can see Trump's tweets and respond to them, it's just that he won't
[00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:40.480]   see them.
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:45.480]   And she says that's not unconstitutional.
[00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:51.560]   She did not order Trump or the assistant to the president, Daniel Scavino, to unblock
[00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:56.720]   the individual plaintiffs or prohibit them from blocking others.
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.600]   She said a declaratory judgment should be sufficient.
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:06.480]   So, there's a right to speak, there's a right to hear, and there's a right to be heard.
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:08.400]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:11.640]   You know what, one of the folks in the chat room says he asked for this, and I think that's
[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.120]   the crux of it right there.
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.600]   He's chosen to use this as a presidential platform, and that changes the game in terms
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.560]   of first of all, I think.
[00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:20.560]   Yeah.
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:25.960]   That's what differentiates it from us doing it versus the bodice.
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:33.160]   So he can block people from press conferences, it has.
[00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:34.160]   Is that unconstitutional?
[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:42.120]   Well, that's the case where, again, I split this up, there's a new book out by a professor
[00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:47.400]   named Anani USC, a professor talking about the right to hear, to not have things you
[00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:51.360]   need to know as a citizen blocked out by noise.
[00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.760]   Then there's the right to be heard.
[00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:56.760]   I don't think anybody would say that you have a right to be heard.
[00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:57.760]   Right.
[00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:58.760]   And so...
[00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:01.240]   You have the right to speak, but not be heard.
[00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.240]   Right.
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:03.240]   Right.
[00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.240]   And the internet is all built for speaking.
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.240]   Right.
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.240]   No, listen.
[00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.240]   Wow.
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:09.240]   Wow.
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:14.160]   Okay, well, that's the breaking news just happened.
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.480]   Is anybody here blocked by him in a curiosity?
[00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:18.920]   I don't follow him.
[00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:23.400]   I have tried and tried and tried everything I can to be blocked by him in this way.
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.400]   I am.
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:25.400]   Why am I not surprised?
[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:26.400]   How can you tell if you're blocked?
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.640]   Oh, because when you try to read him, it would say, "No."
[00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:31.360]   Oh, no, I'm not blocked.
[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.880]   I never replied to him either.
[00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:35.760]   You don't want to ever use Facebook at all.
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:36.760]   No.
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:37.760]   No.
[00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:38.760]   No, he's already having Twitter.
[00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:39.760]   No, there's not anything that I've ever seen.
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:40.760]   Is there any Facebook traffic from him?
[00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:41.760]   No, isn't that interesting?
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:42.760]   And Facebook is far too complicated for him.
[00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:43.760]   He likes Twitter.
[00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:44.760]   He's my beautiful Twitter account.
[00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:48.920]   I'm sorry, Jeff, and you said, "And," you said, "I am blocked by Donald Trump Jr."
[00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:49.920]   Oh, okay.
[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:51.480]   What'd you do?
[00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:52.480]   That's proxy.
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:53.480]   I'm Roger Stone.
[00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:54.480]   Oh, what'd you say?
[00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:55.480]   Oh, I don't even want to know.
[00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:56.480]   I have no idea.
[00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:57.480]   You don't know.
[00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:59.480]   I'm quite proud of that.
[00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:00.480]   I don't want to.
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:07.400]   It is weird, though, that we live in this day and age where this is now a heavy judicial
[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:08.400]   matter.
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:09.760]   First Amendment matter.
[00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:14.680]   It's very strange.
[00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:17.040]   Did you see 60 Minutes on Sunday?
[00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:20.440]   I did not, so you're going to have to summarize it.
[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:23.680]   They had two things that were germane to our conversation here.
[00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:25.400]   One was Theranos.
[00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:30.000]   They're really saying, "How did we and everybody else get this wrong on Elizabeth Holmes?"
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.040]   They talked about the end of the line for Theranos and how she's gone from being a billionaire
[00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:35.680]   to nothing.
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:37.920]   It was fascinating, interesting.
[00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:41.080]   I think based on a new book from a Washington Post.
[00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:43.400]   Yeah, the company stays alive, right?
[00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:46.400]   Well, it's alive, but it's more abundant.
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:49.440]   Well, I thought I just got an investment.
[00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:52.560]   Who would put money into Theranos?
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:55.440]   Somebody who already has money in it.
[00:07:55.440 --> 00:08:00.400]   Theranos, maybe Betsy DeVos, the Secretary of Education, lost $100 million on it.
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:01.400]   Lost $100 million.
[00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:02.920]   Theranos, I saw something.
[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:03.920]   I could swear.
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:04.920]   I don't want to do that.
[00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:09.240]   Was it one point valued at $9 billion?
[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:14.880]   It was, of course, for those who don't know, Elizabeth Holmes, who founded it, was Stanford
[00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:19.880]   freshman who dropped out at the age of 19 because she thought she had discovered a way
[00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:26.720]   to do blood tests with a tiny amount of drop of blood and founded a company raised $9
[00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:31.600]   billion or was valued at $9 billion at one point.
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:38.040]   We're going to try to get John Kerry who wrote the book Bad Blood Secrets and Lies in Silicon
[00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:39.040]   Valley Startup.
[00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:40.040]   I'm sorry.
[00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:41.040]   He's not the Washington Post.
[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:42.040]   He's Wall Street Journal.
[00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:45.720]   He's the guy who wrote that big article that just blew the lid off of it.
[00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:48.200]   Now he's got a novel about it.
[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:49.200]   It appears I'm wrong.
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:53.000]   I could swear I saw that head letter which we used to go, but I don't have it.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   Big name board members like George Schultz, Carlos Slim, Betsy DeVos, $700 million in
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.360]   financing.
[00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:03.520]   At no point did this blood test work.
[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:08.320]   At one point, they were really faking the results.
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:11.800]   They were going out and taking blood tests and putting them in other machines and saying
[00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:14.960]   that Theranos Edison machine had done it.
[00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:24.440]   The SEC sued in March, both Holmes and the president, Ramesh Sonny Balwani, Holmes settled.
[00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:27.640]   She had to give up control of the company, paid a half million dollar fine.
[00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:30.920]   In April, the company laid off most of its staff.
[00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:34.440]   I mean, there's something, there's a husk.
[00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:38.480]   Here's what I saw.
[00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:43.720]   He didn't put any more money in, but Tim Draper said he's still thrilled with his $500,000
[00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:44.720]   investment.
[00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:47.680]   Well, $500,000, he loses as much as some of us.
[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:50.800]   He defended it and her on CNBC.
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:54.680]   An extraordinary company was glad to have backed her, but I don't know her personally.
[00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:55.680]   Really?
[00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:56.680]   It was a great mission.
[00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:57.680]   She did a great job.
[00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:58.680]   I'm thrilled with what she's done.
[00:09:58.680 --> 00:09:59.680]   This is on May 18th.
[00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:00.680]   May 12th.
[00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:03.040]   She really pulled one over on him.
[00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:04.040]   Yeah.
[00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:08.040]   I know they faked the results and such.
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:10.400]   I'd be curious, Jeff, in particular.
[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:12.400]   And I write for the press.
[00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:17.040]   I mean, how much to blame here is on the press in terms of the coverage, the questions.
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:19.000]   Really good point, Kevin.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   Really good point.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.680]   I think absolutely a great deal.
[00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:31.960]   We follow the beast over the cliff in promotion.
[00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:33.120]   And we don't do our own reporting.
[00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:35.800]   We just copy stuff and we look at the clips and rewrite it.
[00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:36.800]   And that's what we do.
[00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:41.040]   I wonder, does anybody know who gets the credit for having blown the whistle on them?
[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:42.040]   Yeah, Kerry.
[00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:45.320]   Well, oh, he got a tip.
[00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:50.600]   In the 60 Minutes piece, they talked to a number of former employees, one of whom did
[00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:55.080]   call the SEC or the FTC about it.
[00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:58.880]   So I think a number of employees kind of went, what is going on?
[00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:04.040]   I don't know who gets credit, except for Kerry Roo for writing the Wall Street Journal
[00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:05.040]   article.
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:08.640]   We all read that was kind of a shocker.
[00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:12.600]   We'd all had kind of, I don't know, I'd had misgivings for a while about it.
[00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:14.000]   But this really blew the lid off it.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:18.680]   So dress wanted, we all wanted to believe this because she looks like a female Steve
[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:19.680]   Jobs, right?
[00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:24.680]   I mean, that is a great story that we all wanted to tell.
[00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:25.680]   And she knew it.
[00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:27.560]   That's why she wore black turtlenecks.
[00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:29.480]   She played on it.
[00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:34.720]   Related to this, I don't know if you guys saw Elon's tweet storm this afternoon going
[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:35.720]   on.
[00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:36.720]   Yeah, he's going off.
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:37.720]   Oh, yeah.
[00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:38.720]   That's on the rundown.
[00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:39.720]   It's there.
[00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:40.720]   This will be a little bit too.
[00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:41.880]   All right, let's read it.
[00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:43.320]   Let's see.
[00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:47.560]   If you're in media and don't want Proveda to exist, right in our call telling your readers
[00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:51.800]   to vote against, he wants to create a media credibility rating site.
[00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:55.520]   Oh, let's, let's, let's go to the beginning of the tweet storm.
[00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:56.520]   That's probably what I should do.
[00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:58.520]   Yeah, the lake is there on the rundown.
[00:11:58.520 --> 00:11:59.520]   Okay.
[00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:00.520]   Yeah.
[00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:08.760]   The whole year-than-thou hypocrisy of big media companies who lay claim to the truth,
[00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:13.920]   but publish only enough to sugarcoat the lie is why the public no longer respects them.
[00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:20.960]   And he's linking to an electric dot CO article that says Tesla could rally his media
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:30.480]   negativities increasingly immaterial says, "Bared."
[00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:34.320]   Apparently there's a nonprofit that did a long-term study on Tesla safety and things
[00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:35.800]   and published it.
[00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:40.680]   And he's very upset about it and basically saying journalists are just after clicks and
[00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:43.680]   they do keep the advertisers happy, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:45.000]   But this was a nonprofit.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:47.240]   They're not even, they don't care about the closing.
[00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:50.080]   He's talking about the consumer report story.
[00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:54.200]   I thought he was at first, but no, he singled out and there's a couple threads in there
[00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:55.760]   from the company.
[00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:59.480]   Jeff, we might know it, not react reveal.
[00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:00.480]   Reveal.
[00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:04.920]   Reveal, yeah, which is, which is Center for Investment Reporting, which is in the East
[00:13:04.920 --> 00:13:06.520]   Bay, San Francisco area.
[00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:09.080]   He also smashed them personally.
[00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:13.600]   Oh, I should mention that my son worked for them the past, last summer.
[00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:14.600]   Oh, really?
[00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:15.600]   Oh, wow.
[00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:16.600]   You never told me that.
[00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:17.600]   Yeah.
[00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:24.960]   I'm probably a compadre of yours, former examiner, editor in chief, Phil.
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:25.960]   Bronstein.
[00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:26.960]   Bronstein.
[00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:29.160]   And reveal is there.
[00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:33.280]   So they've been around for a while and reveal was their new kind of product they just launched
[00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:36.400]   last year to make it be more hip.
[00:13:36.400 --> 00:13:40.600]   So must say there were a bunch of political science students who paid too much attention
[00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:41.600]   to their professor.
[00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:42.600]   Oh, man.
[00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:43.600]   Oh, yeah.
[00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:44.600]   Oh, man.
[00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:45.600]   He does not like the bad news.
[00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:47.600]   And he's been getting a lot of it.
[00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:50.400]   Consumer Reports said the breaking distance on the Model 3 is among the worst they've
[00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:51.400]   ever seen.
[00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:55.600]   They've actually bought a second Model 3 because they couldn't believe how bad it was and it
[00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:57.200]   performed just as badly.
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:01.720]   Tesla's response was, that doesn't match our test results at all.
[00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:08.720]   Yeah, this is, this is a, and of course he, a couple of weeks ago, flamed an analyst
[00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:11.520]   and refused to answer his questions, boring, stupid.
[00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:13.400]   You remember that.
[00:14:13.400 --> 00:14:15.440]   You know, it's getting a little cranky.
[00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:20.240]   My, my tweet was that he's finally met his match, that he's never had a deal with the
[00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:21.760]   failings of people.
[00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:22.760]   Yeah.
[00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:23.760]   Right.
[00:14:23.760 --> 00:14:26.520]   Even PayPal, it was banking laws.
[00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:28.960]   It's money.
[00:14:28.960 --> 00:14:33.120]   Zip to was yellow pages and stuff.
[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:35.080]   Current companies hardware.
[00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:39.320]   You get into what's true and who believes what, who trusts what?
[00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:41.200]   Good luck, Elon.
[00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:45.720]   Something happens when you get, you know, you get this much power and this much money,
[00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:48.320]   you'd stop living in the real world and I think it just takes a little.
[00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:49.320]   You believe your own PR.
[00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:58.400]   It takes a little while, but it happens to, I think everybody that you start, yeah, you
[00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:00.560]   start getting a little weird.
[00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:03.280]   So, so it happened after my first billion then.
[00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:04.280]   Yeah, right.
[00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:05.880]   No, Kevin, that's right.
[00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:06.880]   Yeah.
[00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:08.120]   Kevin, we gotta tell you, we've, we've said it.
[00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:09.840]   You've never been the same.
[00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:10.840]   I know.
[00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:13.520]   Don't be like Elon and don't be like Kevin.
[00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:18.160]   So Elon's response is, I'm going to create, this was a couple hours ago, a site where the
[00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:23.360]   public can rate the core truth of any article and track the credibility score over time
[00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:27.320]   of each journalist, editor and publication thinking of calling it "Proveda."
[00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:31.560]   How many times, how many times have I seen that exact idea from people like him who
[00:15:31.560 --> 00:15:34.960]   get pissed off that somebody got something wrong on the press, which is a problem and
[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:37.880]   it's true and we've all experienced that.
[00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:39.960]   But we'll do this because you ought to be a rating.
[00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:41.360]   That'll solve it all.
[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:42.560]   Why has it been done that?
[00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:48.000]   Well, it's, have you ever seen the comments on YouTube or anything?
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   Yeah.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:52.040]   That's what those comments are.
[00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:56.920]   And of course, there's slash dot and dig and Reddit, all of which have karma scores.
[00:15:56.920 --> 00:16:02.000]   I don't think any of them are journalistic exemplars.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.720]   So yeah.
[00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:06.680]   Yeah.
[00:16:06.680 --> 00:16:09.040]   You know what, Elon, I have a Tesla.
[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:10.720]   I love my Tesla.
[00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:17.200]   I think Elon's done a lot of good to the world, but I think that he also maybe is not reacting
[00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:19.720]   well to, you're right, maybe.
[00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:22.760]   And you're going to have some bumps in the road, just overcome them.
[00:16:22.760 --> 00:16:24.160]   Put your head down and work on it.
[00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:28.040]   You want to prove them wrong, succeed, continue to succeed.
[00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:30.240]   And I respect him a lot.
[00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:36.160]   He took the money he made from PayPal and risked it all on SpaceX and Tesla.
[00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:37.160]   I admire him.
[00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:39.000]   And it's a good thing.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   It's a very good thing.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   Yeah.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.080]   I don't think we'd see electric cars.
[00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:44.680]   Every company in the world is trying to make electric cars now.
[00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:45.960]   I mean, there's a number of reasons.
[00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:47.520]   There's governmental pressure.
[00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:51.680]   But but I think the fact that Tesla's done so well and proved the market has helped a
[00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:53.440]   lot.
[00:16:53.440 --> 00:17:02.160]   So Mark Harris, a scientific writer for the economist said regarding Musk or he's not
[00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:03.160]   kidding, folks.
[00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:07.480]   He noticed that one of Musk's agents had incorporated a provident corp in California
[00:17:07.480 --> 00:17:08.760]   back in October last year.
[00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:10.520]   I was wondering what this is all about.
[00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:16.880]   Provda for those who don't know is the famous Soviet mouthpiece newspaper.
[00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:18.280]   It's not so it's probably still around.
[00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:19.520]   I don't think so, is it?
[00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:20.520]   I don't know.
[00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:22.720]   But and provda means truth.
[00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:23.720]   Yeah.
[00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:25.960]   But of course that was ironic.
[00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:27.960]   Yes.
[00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:28.960]   Yeah.
[00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:32.560]   Yeah, provda says circulation of a hundred thousand.
[00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:34.240]   No, we can beat it around.
[00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:37.600]   Propped to that are you.
[00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:44.640]   We're Musk's earlier efforts ever publicly owned companies before he sold them.
[00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:52.080]   Zip to I don't know whether well, certainly wasn't PayPal before he sold them is the
[00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:53.080]   question.
[00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:54.080]   Did they go public first?
[00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:57.600]   I'm just thinking he's under pressure from shareholders.
[00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:58.600]   He's not used to this.
[00:17:58.600 --> 00:17:59.600]   He's never been to exactly.
[00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:00.600]   Yeah.
[00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:05.120]   I'm not saying I'm not justifying his reactions by any means, but you know, that's that's
[00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:07.520]   the difference I think.
[00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:09.520]   Yeah.
[00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:10.520]   Yeah.
[00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:11.520]   Yeah.
[00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:19.520]   Provda is pretty much the same kind of kind of the news of the world publication that it
[00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:20.520]   always is.
[00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:21.520]   Yeah.
[00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:22.520]   It's been it's been a foul.
[00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:26.360]   You know, it's been part of these efforts to spread lies.
[00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:27.360]   Yeah.
[00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:28.360]   It's a vector.
[00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:29.360]   Yeah.
[00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:37.040]   So the second thing on 60 minutes was actually the biggest story for us.
[00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:38.320]   Distract you, yeah.
[00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:45.840]   Which is Google and a really kind of, I would say a kind of classic 60 minutes hit piece
[00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:52.440]   on Google with the standard or the right up on it, the standard attacker, the one who
[00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:57.200]   will always be guaranteed to attack Google and press go right to him.
[00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:00.800]   Let's quote Ben Thompson for a step, straightcurry.
[00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:03.920]   The 60 minutes report was not exactly fair and balanced.
[00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:09.560]   It featured an anti tech monopoly crusader and anti tech monopoly activist and anti tech
[00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:13.640]   monopoly regulator and Yelp CEO Jeremy Stoppelman.
[00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:17.560]   And in what seems highly unlikely to be a coincidence Yelp this week filed a new antitrust
[00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:19.560]   complaint in the EU against Google.
[00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:20.560]   Yep.
[00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:22.320]   There we go.
[00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:28.480]   So Yelp did a blog post about the 60 minutes feature in which they included a several year
[00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:34.720]   old video that explains how anti competitive Google is.
[00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:40.960]   Ben points out the answer box that Yelp there three Yelp appears to be Yelp's position
[00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:44.680]   appears to be the Google's answer box is an anti competitive because it only includes
[00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:46.480]   reviews and ratings from Google.
[00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:50.840]   Presumably the situation could be resolved where Google to use sources like Yelp.
[00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:52.720]   There are three big problems with this argument.
[00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:58.720]   First, the answer box did used to include content from Yelp until they complained.
[00:19:58.720 --> 00:20:04.560]   So Google stopped doing so when the FTS under pressure from the FTC in 2013 second in a
[00:20:04.560 --> 00:20:08.000]   telling testament to the power being on top of search results, Google's ratings and reviews
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:11.280]   have improved considerably in the two years since the video was posted.
[00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:13.000]   This is an aesthetic market.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.080]   Third, and this is the point of this article, what Yelp seems to want will only serve to
[00:20:17.080 --> 00:20:23.440]   make Google stronger and then Ben delves into his trademark deep dive on the difference
[00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:28.280]   between platforms and aggregators.
[00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:40.440]   And actually, I think one of the quotes, which is he quotes Chamath Paliapatia in an interview.
[00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:46.200]   When asked about Chamath was at Facebook, when asked do you see any similarities from
[00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:49.560]   your time at Facebook with Facebook platform and connecting how Uber may supercharge their
[00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:53.680]   platform, Chamath said neither of them are platforms.
[00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:59.880]   They're both kind of like these comical endeavors to do you as an enth- that do you as an enth-
[00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:00.880]   priority.
[00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:02.080]   I was in charge of Facebook platform.
[00:21:02.080 --> 00:21:06.240]   We trumpet it out like it was some hot stuff big deal.
[00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:11.120]   We raised money from Bill Gates.
[00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:15.160]   Gate when that $15 billion raise happened a few months after Facebook platform and Gates
[00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:18.280]   said something along the lines of that's a crock of BS.
[00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:20.600]   This is in a platform.
[00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:22.400]   And this is I love this line of platform.
[00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:28.040]   This is Bill Gates is when the economic value of everybody that uses it exceeds the value
[00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:30.000]   of the company that creates it.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.240]   Then it's a platform.
[00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:32.480]   Yes, strong.
[00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:33.480]   Good definition.
[00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:34.480]   I love that.
[00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:39.000]   I always say that a platform, you know you have a platform when users put it to a use,
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.120]   you did not anticipate when they take it over.
[00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:42.120]   That's good.
[00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:44.400]   And ultimately that leads to economic value.
[00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:45.400]   Yes.
[00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:47.960]   So he says, so Windows was a platform.
[00:21:47.960 --> 00:21:54.480]   Yes, iPhone is not a platform because Apple captures the vast majority of the ecosystem.
[00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:56.200]   So you know it's not a platform.
[00:21:56.200 --> 00:22:01.600]   So he makes a distinction between aggregators and platforms.
[00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:05.080]   And the aggregator business, and this is something Ben hits on a lot.
[00:22:05.080 --> 00:22:07.920]   This idea of the aggregator business model.
[00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:11.480]   The aggregator owns the customers, the suppliers follow.
[00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:13.560]   So Google is not a platform.
[00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:15.800]   Facebook is not a platform.
[00:22:15.800 --> 00:22:21.440]   But as aggregators, Google has the luxury of operating in an environment, the worldwide
[00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:24.360]   web that was by default completely open.
[00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:25.640]   That let the best technology win.
[00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:29.040]   And that win was augmented by the data that comes from serving an ever increasing part
[00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:30.040]   of the market.
[00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:33.240]   The end result was the integration of end users and data feedback cycle that made Google
[00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:37.480]   search better and better the more it was used.
[00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:39.800]   So anyway, I could.
[00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:42.000]   It wasn't going to be.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:47.280]   I could vaguely see Google as a platform because of all of the other things that it
[00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:53.520]   has under its umbrella that not only just regular consumers get to use, but companies
[00:22:53.520 --> 00:23:00.400]   are able to use to get work done, you know, under the Google brand.
[00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:06.560]   Except that according to Ben's definition, the beneficiary of all that is Google, not
[00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:08.040]   the third parties.
[00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:09.040]   Yeah.
[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:10.040]   All right.
[00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:15.320]   So that's classic aggregator.
[00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:20.680]   So anyway, that's a little off from our initial conversation, which was 60 minutes.
[00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:21.680]   Why?
[00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:27.240]   Are they just piling on as regulators, government and regular people start to hate these Facebook
[00:23:27.240 --> 00:23:29.120]   and now Google's turn?
[00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:32.360]   Oh, it was Google's turn before.
[00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:35.360]   And then they got, they kind of bled it dry.
[00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:36.360]   And then went to Facebook.
[00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:39.720]   And then when I got a supply of blood back, they're going after Google again.
[00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:43.800]   I'm sorry, it's my business, but it's a media narrative and media are in a position of
[00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:47.480]   conflict of interest because media think that Google stole their advertisers, which
[00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:50.080]   they didn't, but that's where it is.
[00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:51.680]   And so media keep going after them.
[00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:57.320]   And right now, it's just the cool thing to do to go after technology, right, and to blame
[00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:59.320]   everything on technology.
[00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:04.240]   I'm looking at vigor in the chat room.
[00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:08.240]   And he says he or she says, how is Google's Android not a platform?
[00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:09.960]   Can we consider Android a platform?
[00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:18.120]   I would say so, just because of the televisions and phones and everything else that people
[00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:19.360]   build around it.
[00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:20.680]   Yeah, Google gives it away.
[00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:23.240]   So it's the, it's the third party.
[00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:24.640]   Well, they get back too.
[00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:26.320]   They get back as they get the data.
[00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:28.000]   They get the search data.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   Right.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   There's always that.
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:35.600]   And even the advertising is a platform to the extent that it enables you to create a business
[00:24:35.600 --> 00:24:36.920]   that you wouldn't be a great owner.
[00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:38.320]   Well, that spends points.
[00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:39.320]   That spends points.
[00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:44.560]   Yelp has, you know, entire business was predicated on Google doing their customer acquisition
[00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:46.440]   for them.
[00:24:46.440 --> 00:24:49.200]   You know, Yelp succeeded because of Google.
[00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:50.200]   Yeah.
[00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:54.200]   It seems a bit rich, he says, that Yelp should be free to leverage its app to avoid Google
[00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:57.720]   completely that demand that Google continue to feature Yelp prominently in its search
[00:24:57.720 --> 00:25:01.600]   results, particularly a mobile when the answer box where the answer box says particular
[00:25:01.600 --> 00:25:02.600]   utility.
[00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:07.200]   So, by the way, Yelp, when I go to the website, I get peed off.
[00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:08.200]   I know.
[00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:09.200]   It's not very good.
[00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:10.200]   That's Google's position.
[00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:14.680]   Google says, well, we, we just try to give people the results, the best results.
[00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:15.680]   Right.
[00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:16.680]   So here's the irony where we are.
[00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:20.600]   So the one hand people say you should be open to everything and equal to everything
[00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:22.320]   as if there's such a thing.
[00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:25.120]   And then the other hand, when people start doing bad things in the platform, we tell
[00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:29.320]   all the platforms, you should be making judgments and getting rid of bad stuff.
[00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:31.880]   They can't win either way, except for the fact that they're the biggest companies on
[00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:35.920]   Earth and they're very rich, then they win.
[00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:40.440]   Is it mean anything that Google removed that don't be evil clause from its code for context?
[00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:41.920]   Isn't that an old story?
[00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:43.640]   Didn't they do that like a year ago?
[00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:45.480]   Were they, were they updated it?
[00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:47.400]   They updated it then.
[00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:51.800]   I think this is a, I don't know that this is a legit story.
[00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:55.040]   I think this was done quite some time ago.
[00:25:55.040 --> 00:25:56.040]   I don't know.
[00:25:56.040 --> 00:26:01.480]   They went to the way back machine and they're saying, gizmoto, this is saying that it was
[00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:03.120]   there back in April.
[00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:04.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:09.320]   It alphabet, alphabet changed the motto to do the right thing.
[00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:10.680]   That's what you're thinking of.
[00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:17.280]   But yeah, Google always, he says, here's, so they compared April 21st of this year, which
[00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:20.480]   has this paragraph, don't be evil.
[00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:21.480]   You know, on and on.
[00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:26.520]   And the Google code of conduct and then the May 4th version doesn't have that phrase.
[00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:27.520]   It was completely rewritten.
[00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:33.320]   I suspect that this rewriting has more to do with GDPR than anything else, but I don't,
[00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:34.320]   but I don't know.
[00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:36.840]   They, they, again, we can't win most sides.
[00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:39.240]   They get tons of crap for the don't be evil.
[00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:40.240]   People misunderstand it.
[00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:43.880]   I think it's, it's, it's coming down Moses from the mountaintop of the tablet.
[00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:44.880]   This is, we're not evil.
[00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:45.880]   It's not.
[00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:49.680]   It says employees prevent us from being evil on the one because it's bad business.
[00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:50.680]   Yeah.
[00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:55.640]   I, I think whether it's true or not, it's kind of a tempest in the teapot.
[00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:56.640]   It is.
[00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:57.640]   Yeah.
[00:26:57.640 --> 00:26:58.640]   It is.
[00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:01.240]   Uh, all right.
[00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:02.720]   How about the scoop?
[00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:03.720]   This guy, Kevin Tofel.
[00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:05.480]   I don't know where he gets his stuff from.
[00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:06.960]   I want to say this.
[00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:09.400]   God bless Kevin Tofel.
[00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:15.000]   Kevin Tofel is the one person in all of technology journalism who writes for those who were smart
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:23.160]   enough to not have gigantic steam powered, atomic powered machines like ant there.
[00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:25.560]   See, ant goes for complication.
[00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:29.840]   And once the biggest show off thing possible, that is not a Chromebook.
[00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:32.400]   I'm guessing that's not a Chrome OS device.
[00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:34.920]   That is a Chrome reactor.
[00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:44.680]   But, but to be fair, if you're going to process drone videos or hey, I just got to go profusion,
[00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:50.040]   that thing even on an, on an iMac Pro takes hours to render the 360 video.
[00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:52.120]   You got to have a 360 video was tough.
[00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:54.280]   You really need some horsepower.
[00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:55.920]   You really do.
[00:27:55.920 --> 00:28:01.040]   But for the, for the rest of us, there's this, the, this is the Chromebook.
[00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:04.480]   And you know, this has been a ridiculously premium, as always with Google, this was a
[00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:06.120]   thousand dollar starting point.
[00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:07.120]   I love it.
[00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:08.120]   It was, it's well worth it.
[00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:10.760]   It's the best Chromebook, but it's just a Chromebook.
[00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:16.840]   The Kevin scoop is that Acer's coming along with something that might, might give the
[00:28:16.840 --> 00:28:18.720]   Pixel book a run for its money.
[00:28:18.720 --> 00:28:19.720]   Tell us about it, Kevin.
[00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:20.720]   Yeah.
[00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:24.640]   So today Acer actually had their, Acer next event in New York City.
[00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:30.080]   I did not go, but I was able to find some information about six hours before the event
[00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:31.520]   and figure out what they were launching.
[00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:35.760]   And they actually launched four Chromebooks, two, two or more premium.
[00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:41.840]   They are the Chromebook spin 13, which has a fold over display, 360 display, and the
[00:28:41.840 --> 00:28:45.880]   regular clamshell Chromebook 13.
[00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:52.440]   These are the first Chromebooks with the eighth gen Intel core processors, which is pretty
[00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:54.760]   hot, not as hot as it is.
[00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:55.760]   Yeah.
[00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:59.840]   Well, it's, it's not, not a tank like what you have, but still it's been four or five.
[00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:01.520]   Don't be ashamed, Kevin.
[00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:02.520]   Don't be ashamed.
[00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:06.000]   Oh, no, it's not good.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.400]   And 16 gigs of up to 16 gigs of RAM.
[00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:16.240]   Yeah, which is Pixel book territory in terms of specs, you know, even the display is a
[00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:21.480]   2256 by 1504, which is a lot, but three by two aspect ratio.
[00:29:21.480 --> 00:29:29.040]   Again, like the Pixel book has a wake up stylus, a digitizer rather with an EMR stylus
[00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:30.040]   pen.
[00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:32.720]   So, you know, this, this has potential.
[00:29:32.720 --> 00:29:36.480]   Now that the one thing, somebody was a Jeff who just asked how much?
[00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:37.480]   Yeah.
[00:29:37.480 --> 00:29:39.840]   That's, that's the one thing they did not say.
[00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:43.360]   Unfortunately, the, the spin has no price yet.
[00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:48.760]   The regular clamshell starts at three 99, but that is more likely the base model with
[00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:51.880]   like a puny Pentium or a Celeron inside.
[00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:55.760]   So you're going to, you're going to pay, I don't know if you'll pay a thousand like
[00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:58.000]   a Pixel book, but you're probably talking $7,800.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.080]   But not, not arm on either of these, which is interesting.
[00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:04.240]   You got to pay for those, those CPUs at the very minimum.
[00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:05.240]   Yeah.
[00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:06.240]   And all that.
[00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:09.000]   Especially early, early in the cycle when they're just being produced and, and they're
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:10.840]   hot commodity, you know, no pun intended.
[00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:14.940]   I mean, a lot of laptop makers want these chips.
[00:30:14.940 --> 00:30:15.940]   So it's, it's a question.
[00:30:15.940 --> 00:30:16.940]   Who's got enough pull?
[00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:20.280]   And Acer said that I kind of thought this number was low, but it's still a big number.
[00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:23.760]   They said that they have sold more than 10 million Chromebooks and they are among the
[00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:26.240]   tops in terms of sales for Chromebooks.
[00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:27.240]   So.
[00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:32.440]   Which one you wrote about two weeks ago, that's going to have the, the separable screen.
[00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:35.160]   Well, that's, we don't know who's making it yet.
[00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:37.640]   It's a code name, Nocturne.
[00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:42.000]   And it will have a detachable display, just like the HP Chromebook X2, which should be
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.840]   out June 7th.
[00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:49.680]   What's interesting on that one, Jeff, is that it has Pogo pins, just like the iPad,
[00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:51.080]   the iPad Pro.
[00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:54.400]   And that's what Google is using to determine if it's connected to the keyboard.
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:59.640]   So my suspicion is based on their code that it may be like a flat keyboard, kind of like
[00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:01.840]   a surface or iPad keyboard.
[00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:07.400]   Basically, it's just a big screen and probably a thin keyboard, but we'll have to see about
[00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:08.400]   that.
[00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:14.880]   And so Kevin, given these that are coming out, we have our Chromebook pixels and we love
[00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:15.880]   them.
[00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:16.880]   Add them all together.
[00:31:16.880 --> 00:31:21.200]   They're about as powerful as Ann's machine, but we're proud of that.
[00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:25.200]   Which one are you on the higher end, on the better end?
[00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:28.600]   Which machine should I be waiting for?
[00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:29.600]   That's a toughy.
[00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:31.880]   I get that question all the time, actually, because I keep finding all these Chromebooks
[00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:32.880]   that are in the works.
[00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:36.880]   And when I find them, it's so early in the process, they're six to eight months out,
[00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:37.880]   right?
[00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:42.160]   So we know the HP is coming and that starts at 599 and it's detachable, which I really,
[00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:43.400]   really want.
[00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:46.560]   I'm not going to go for it, though, because everything, all the cool stuff, the cool kids
[00:31:46.560 --> 00:31:49.560]   are playing on Pixelbooks with Linux apps and crouton and all that.
[00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:52.520]   So I'm going to stay with Pixelbook for now.
[00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:55.040]   There's another one I found, Jeff, that has a 4K display.
[00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:59.400]   Its code name is Atlas and again, detachable.
[00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:04.680]   And I'm wondering if that's going to be a Google update in the fall.
[00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:10.920]   And I probably would wait for a Google Chromebook device because again, that's what they develop
[00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:13.520]   all the fun toys for, right?
[00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:14.520]   So that's me.
[00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:18.360]   I mean, if you're not going to get into the tinkering and the Linux and all that, you
[00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:21.680]   know, the HP might do it for you and that's coming next month.
[00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:24.960]   So if I were going to recommend a machine to a colleague and make sure that they were
[00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:27.440]   going to wind me about having too many tabs open.
[00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:30.800]   I mean, there's so many good choices out there.
[00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:35.080]   The whole tab thing, just make sure you have at least four, if not eight giga ram.
[00:32:35.080 --> 00:32:39.240]   And if you can go with at least a Core i3 processor, that should keep them happy for
[00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:40.240]   a long time.
[00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:44.080]   I mean, that wouldn't render 10 seconds of Ants videos, but hey, you know, they don't
[00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:46.480]   keep them happy.
[00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:47.800]   What's the story with Christina?
[00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:51.960]   This is the technology that's going to allow us to run Linux apps on that Chromebook.
[00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:55.160]   Yeah, still in the works and Google did announce it at IO.
[00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:59.160]   Obviously, in fact, that was the show is on last and we talked about it.
[00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:03.920]   They're making changes on a daily basis, trying to make it more stable, more secure.
[00:33:03.920 --> 00:33:08.520]   I've even found out that they are looking to bring it to old Chromebooks because it's
[00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:10.920]   really not about the hardware that much.
[00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:11.920]   Performance.
[00:33:11.920 --> 00:33:12.920]   Yeah.
[00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:13.920]   No, it's the Linux kernel.
[00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:14.920]   Yeah.
[00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:19.760]   They're working with Linux 4.4 on all the supported devices.
[00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:23.760]   Now what they're doing is they're trying to backport some of the Linux modules to Linux
[00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:25.080]   3.1 devices.
[00:33:25.080 --> 00:33:30.560]   So anything you bought maybe two years ago in terms of Chromebook might be on Linux 3.x.
[00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:33.120]   Maybe you'll be able to get Christina on that.
[00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:34.120]   They're really trying.
[00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:38.120]   I don't know if they'll succeed, but they're really trying to make it as wide as possible.
[00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:42.080]   And we've already seen them try and it took a long time for Android apps and there's still
[00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:44.880]   a lot of devices that don't support the Google Play Store.
[00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:48.920]   So some are skeptical of all this whole Christianity stuff and I get that.
[00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:50.920]   But we'll see.
[00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:52.560]   They're trying.
[00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:58.280]   So Kevin, I don't know if we've discussed this and if we did stop me.
[00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:02.480]   But there are various because there's no we've only had so much to say in life, that's
[00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:03.480]   it.
[00:34:03.480 --> 00:34:09.640]   There's various Android apps that just aren't working well for me on the Chromebook.
[00:34:09.640 --> 00:34:14.040]   Or Skype, it just feels like it's going through 25 layers and it's not working well.
[00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:18.720]   Whereas Skype on my Android tablet is good.
[00:34:18.720 --> 00:34:23.920]   Same with Netflix, same with Showtime to go.
[00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:28.640]   These apps just are flaky.
[00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:31.040]   Is that what your experience?
[00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:35.440]   To be honest, Jeff, the apps that I use for Android on my Pixelbook aren't streaming or
[00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:36.440]   media apps.
[00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:39.200]   I tend to just use the browser for those.
[00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:44.320]   I can only give you a guess on what the issue may or may not be here.
[00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:48.120]   These may have something to do with the fact that Android is running in a container just
[00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:51.040]   like Linux is for Christianity.
[00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:54.560]   And I know with Linux, they don't support hardware acceleration yet.
[00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:55.560]   They don't even support sound.
[00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:58.760]   I think they're going to have GPU support.
[00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:00.360]   They're going to have it, but they don't.
[00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:01.360]   Yeah.
[00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:06.920]   And I just wonder because they're trying to leverage the hardware outside of the Android
[00:35:06.920 --> 00:35:12.800]   container, I'm wondering if they're having issues, not they, but the apps are of passing
[00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:15.800]   through to make what needs to happen happen.
[00:35:15.800 --> 00:35:18.240]   You're not the first person to tell me this with these particular apps.
[00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:21.360]   And I actually have passed that on to some of my former teammates over at Google.
[00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:23.680]   I didn't get a response yet, but you know, it was a good thing.
[00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:25.680]   When I met, they had a Chrome at I/O.
[00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:29.880]   I of course took the opportunity to be a self-centered and tell him this.
[00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:33.320]   He said he was surprised because he said that Netflix is a huge download.
[00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:39.200]   We're leading downloads for Android on Chrome.
[00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:42.680]   But boy, mine is just like you.
[00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:45.040]   I think it is.
[00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:49.560]   My sense, I may be misunderstanding this is that the Android isn't running.
[00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:52.960]   Is it just running as a container or is it running an emulation?
[00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:53.960]   It's running in a container.
[00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:54.960]   Okay.
[00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:55.960]   It's not an emulation.
[00:35:55.960 --> 00:35:56.960]   No.
[00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:57.960]   No, it's not.
[00:35:57.960 --> 00:36:01.280]   Google is leveraging the container technology they used for Android.
[00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:02.720]   It's not the exact same.
[00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:05.760]   But I think it's LXC and LXD in Linux.
[00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:10.440]   And I'm not a huge knowledgeable person about Linux, but my understanding that's the container
[00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:14.280]   technology they're using, which has been around in Linux for a while.
[00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:19.280]   I'm also wondering if, and it shouldn't matter, but I'm wondering if, because we have Intel-powered
[00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:23.680]   devices, maybe some of the ARM Chromebooks aren't having these problems.
[00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:25.680]   I don't know.
[00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:30.560]   Yeah, I would think it'd be, yeah, that makes sense.
[00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:32.560]   Yeah.
[00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:33.560]   Okay.
[00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:37.400]   So, because the nice thing about running Linux on a Chromebook is that a Chromebook essentially
[00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:39.440]   is, Chrome OS is Linux.
[00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:45.560]   So it's not, it's not, it doesn't really have to in any way translate calls or anything.
[00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:46.560]   It's Linux.
[00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:52.040]   Android's not, which is in theory on Linux, but it's not a Linux kernel.
[00:36:52.040 --> 00:36:54.080]   I don't know.
[00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:56.000]   Have you played with Christianity yet, Kevin?
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:57.400]   Oh, every day.
[00:36:57.400 --> 00:37:01.480]   I actually was going to use the Pixelbook for Skype on, Christianity on the Pixelbook today
[00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:05.160]   for this, but I found out I couldn't hear anything on a Skype call.
[00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:06.560]   So I'm like, oh, that's not good.
[00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:09.880]   It's on the, it's on Chrome OS developer channel now, right?
[00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:10.880]   Right.
[00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:12.320]   Dev68, channel 68.
[00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:13.320]   Yep.
[00:37:13.320 --> 00:37:15.880]   Which means it's probably fairly close to coming out.
[00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:16.880]   It could be.
[00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:19.680]   There was a beta update for Chrome OS just today, I believe.
[00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:22.720]   And I don't think it's in there yet.
[00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:27.000]   I think Google had said maybe July, August.
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:32.320]   I think they're kind of over promising, I'm sorry, under promising and over delivering
[00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:33.320]   here.
[00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:36.520]   I think they want to push it out earlier just based on the schedule, but they're saying
[00:37:36.520 --> 00:37:38.480]   July or August.
[00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:39.800]   And they, okay.
[00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:40.800]   Yeah.
[00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:45.000]   Do you have to turn off security on a Chromebook to run the dev channel?
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:49.120]   No, that's the beautiful part of all of this with Christina because with crouton, you did
[00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:50.560]   have to be in developer mode.
[00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:54.640]   So you're basically opening up, you know, some security potential issues there.
[00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:59.160]   This you just use the regular non-development mode standard Chromebook dev channel.
[00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:00.560]   So there's no security issues.
[00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:06.600]   You can't even really pass easily pass data from the Linux container to the Chrome OS system.
[00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:15.560]   However, I, you can mount your files app in Chrome OS to the Linux container folders through
[00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:16.640]   secure shelf.
[00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:21.360]   So that's how they're keeping the security of the data passing between the two systems,
[00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:22.360]   so to speak.
[00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:24.360]   So is it in the settings?
[00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:26.920]   I could just turn on going to the dev channel.
[00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:27.920]   Yeah.
[00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:34.440]   If you go into the dev channel in settings and then you'll see a new setting in the apps,
[00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:41.200]   I'm sorry, setting for enabling Linux beta and you might have a bit of a tough time,
[00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:43.080]   but I can send you some some instructions.
[00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:44.640]   No, no, no, I can't.
[00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:45.640]   There's two.
[00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:46.640]   I can't.
[00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:47.640]   I can't.
[00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:48.640]   It's on my site, Jeff.
[00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:52.160]   If you can't figure it out, you shouldn't do it.
[00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:56.080]   You remember trying to get me working, Leo, you had to talk me through stuff on the show
[00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:57.080]   line by line.
[00:38:57.080 --> 00:38:58.080]   I remember that.
[00:38:58.080 --> 00:39:03.520]   So in the settings, if you look at about Chrome OS, you can see that you can get in a
[00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:06.480]   different channel, stable beta or developer unstable.
[00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:08.560]   So you have to go to developer for this.
[00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:09.560]   Correct.
[00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:10.560]   Yeah.
[00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:11.560]   Warning.
[00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:12.560]   Warning.
[00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:13.560]   You're switching the developer channel.
[00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:17.280]   Bull Robinson contains features in progress.
[00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:21.000]   You won't lose data by going down, but when you go back, you don't have to rebuild it
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   or anything.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:25.520]   Yeah, but when you go back up to beta or stable, it's going to power wash and wipe your data,
[00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:26.520]   just so you know.
[00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:27.520]   That's fine.
[00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:28.520]   Cool.
[00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:33.160]   So I just, that was, it was that easy just to under build information, detailed building
[00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:34.320]   information, you just change it.
[00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:35.320]   Now it's updated.
[00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:36.320]   You'll see it.
[00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:37.320]   Yeah.
[00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:40.080]   Once it's done updating and you click the top left settings, you'll see you'll have a new
[00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:41.960]   option for Linux enabled.
[00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:42.960]   Right.
[00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:44.800]   I've seen that on your site.
[00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:45.800]   Yep.
[00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:46.800]   Yep.
[00:39:46.800 --> 00:39:47.800]   Wow.
[00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:48.800]   Very exciting.
[00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:51.960]   So new Chromebooks, Acer just announced looks like the very, at least the mid-to-end.
[00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:54.960]   Mid-range ones that we've been asking for it because they've been, you know, the high
[00:39:54.960 --> 00:40:00.160]   end and low and have been well represented by Google and everybody else, respectively.
[00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:01.680]   But it's nice to have something in the mid-range.
[00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:04.880]   Acer's done some nice full aluminum body mid-range already.
[00:40:04.880 --> 00:40:08.320]   In fact, I think they're making some of the nicest Chromebooks.
[00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:09.320]   So I'm glad to see you.
[00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:17.720]   I always want to support these things, but it's tough because I spend so much time editing.
[00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:22.360]   You know, I have to spend my time editing and being productive.
[00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:29.280]   And yeah, I could run Lightroom on the website, what have you, or in some instances, run the
[00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:30.280]   Android version.
[00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:32.760]   But yeah, that's not going to do what you need to do.
[00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:33.760]   You still need to do stuff.
[00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:34.760]   I need Photoshop too.
[00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:35.760]   Yeah.
[00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:39.400]   You know, I got to have Photoshop for certain projects, especially if I'm out doing, say,
[00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:42.160]   a headshot shoot or something like that.
[00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:44.360]   I need that productivity.
[00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:49.000]   And all of these specs from these Chromebooks are just, "Oh, they're great."
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:52.320]   But the back of my mind is like, "You'll never have one."
[00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:55.120]   Your kids might have one, Ant.
[00:40:55.120 --> 00:41:04.480]   So what would it take you to make cloud-based editing like you do possible?
[00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:06.120]   What's the speed necessary?
[00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:07.120]   What's the processor?
[00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:08.120]   What's the memory?
[00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:09.120]   What's the processing?
[00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:15.560]   It's processing and even, I want to say there was one app out there that tried to give you
[00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:22.040]   cloud video editing where it sent up your edits to the cloud and it came back down and
[00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:23.400]   that just took forever.
[00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:28.360]   It did whatever I wanted it to do, but it was so slow because of the syncing back and
[00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:29.360]   forth.
[00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:35.400]   You know, a five-minute HD video could be, you know, almost a gig in size.
[00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:38.480]   But I thought Ant doesn't need that back and forth.
[00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:40.480]   And you try and find the data back and forth.
[00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:42.480]   It just takes too long.
[00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:44.840]   But doesn't have to go back and forth.
[00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:50.000]   If you upload the entire video to online and all of the processing happens up in the
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:53.720]   cloud and all you're doing is seeing it on your machine.
[00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:55.840]   You need to interact with it, Jeff.
[00:41:55.840 --> 00:41:59.640]   So you could, you know, what they could do is have a low quality version locally that
[00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:02.600]   you do an edit list on something like that.
[00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:06.920]   If you had enough bandwidth, I think it would, it's doable, especially because you have the
[00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:08.640]   servers could be very, very powerful.
[00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:11.800]   You could use, you know, Google's cloud stuff to do it.
[00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:14.520]   If you had the bandwidth, that would be the only thing.
[00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:17.640]   You know, when I was trying these files that you're working with.
[00:42:17.640 --> 00:42:25.360]   Again, like I said, a five-minute HD video could be a gig at minimum, depending on your
[00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:28.920]   effects and your other audio editing and things like that.
[00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:31.960]   You know, and that's, that's just for five minutes.
[00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:34.760]   And my videos are always longer than five minutes.
[00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:38.320]   I'm pretty long winded when it comes to my videos.
[00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:40.320]   There's no reason to jump through hoops like this either.
[00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:44.000]   I mean, we, you have hardware, local hardware that can do it.
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:45.480]   That's a perfectly reasonable thing.
[00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:47.360]   You got to use the tool that's right for the job.
[00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:51.280]   I mean, yeah, I just want for things like students to be able to edit a video without
[00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:52.280]   the expense.
[00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:53.280]   Right.
[00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:58.080]   I just wish there was a better relationship between the folks at Google Alphabet and the
[00:42:58.080 --> 00:43:03.800]   likes of Adobe or even whoever else is out there creating these different non-linear
[00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:10.280]   editors and photo editors because the need is there.
[00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:16.440]   But I just can't buy in until I have something proven that's going to allow me to go to a
[00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:21.760]   client and do what I need to do right there without running through protsies and jumping
[00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:22.760]   through all these hoops.
[00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:24.760]   It feels like Adobe's working on this.
[00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:26.920]   They're moving more and more to the cloud.
[00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:27.920]   They're trying.
[00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:33.640]   But even with, like I said, even with the Lightroom, Lightroom Mobile or Lightroom CC, whatever
[00:43:33.640 --> 00:43:34.640]   it's called.
[00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:35.640]   Yeah.
[00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:36.640]   Creative Cloud.
[00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:37.640]   I don't count the time, but it ain't.
[00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:38.640]   Oh, you don't like, you're still with Classic?
[00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:41.200]   Yeah, I still go back to the Classic.
[00:43:41.200 --> 00:43:44.320]   Yeah, I keep going back to the Classic too.
[00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:48.720]   They don't like, you could, you could remote into that big old barrel that's sitting next
[00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:51.160]   to you there, Ant, but I mean, it's probably still.
[00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:53.560]   Believe it or not, I've done that.
[00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:54.560]   Really?
[00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:59.640]   You could do that with a Chromebook, but if it's not, as Leo said, I agree 100 percent,
[00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:01.360]   you got to use the best tool for the task.
[00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:05.240]   And if the Chromebook's not your thing for your task, then you shouldn't buy a Chromebook
[00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:06.240]   without a doubt.
[00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:09.640]   It's nice to have a Chromebook 2 back there in the corner somewhere.
[00:44:09.640 --> 00:44:12.080]   I have one of the Toshiba Chromebook 2s.
[00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:13.080]   And I love that.
[00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:15.080]   That will not do it for you.
[00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:16.080]   No.
[00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:17.160]   And it was, but it was fast.
[00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:20.520]   It was fast for just general regular people use.
[00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:25.160]   You know, if you want to browse the web, you want to watch Netflix or whatever, if I wanted
[00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:28.600]   to write an article, that thing was great.
[00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:35.320]   But if I wanted to edit some raw files, there are a couple apps out there, but it still,
[00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:37.880]   it took a little work.
[00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:43.160]   But will the trajectory get us to a point where, you know, again, not you, but when
[00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:50.360]   360 half hour video, but for users and students and families to be able to edit video effectively
[00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:55.400]   on the cloud, is there a point in time where we're going to get there?
[00:44:55.400 --> 00:45:01.640]   I wish I knew I would have assumed it was around the corner because there's so many,
[00:45:01.640 --> 00:45:06.720]   there's a couple of different apps on mobile devices that allow you to do video editing
[00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:10.360]   and photo editing at a decent scale.
[00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:12.800]   People do it on iPads all the time.
[00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:17.280]   I mean, this is one place where Apple has a pretty good advantage in schools.
[00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:18.560]   You can do all of that in iPads.
[00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:19.920]   You can shoot the movie on an iPad.
[00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:21.440]   You can edit it.
[00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:24.280]   You can, I mean, you can do it all on an iPad.
[00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:27.800]   There is a handful of apps out there, a handful, but...
[00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:30.880]   Boy, you can't do what you're doing.
[00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:34.440]   So professional production is going to always, I think this is just, I mean, you're not going
[00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:38.640]   to make an album, you're not going to edit a video, you're not going to launch rockets
[00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:39.800]   on a Chromebook.
[00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:42.840]   For those kinds of professional uses, you're going to have heavy duty computers.
[00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:44.440]   Why shouldn't you?
[00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:49.720]   But I think what Jeff, I think what you're asking is there is a segment, the education
[00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:52.000]   segment where they would like to be able to do this kind of stuff.
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:53.720]   Yeah, I think it would be hand rates.
[00:45:53.720 --> 00:45:55.720]   I think they can't do it on an iPad.
[00:45:55.720 --> 00:45:57.240]   They can't do it on a Chromebook yet.
[00:45:57.240 --> 00:45:59.880]   And that's a failing on Google's part.
[00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:00.880]   I think Google's part.
[00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:01.880]   Okay.
[00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:06.840]   Apple's really put a lot of effort into making sure that it has every iPad comes with iMovie,
[00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:12.240]   it comes with all the iWorks suite, it comes, they've got built-in camera.
[00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:13.560]   It's kind of made to do that.
[00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:16.800]   And that's one of the things Apple shows schools all the time.
[00:46:16.800 --> 00:46:21.880]   And I know, in fact, our kid who has an iPad in sixth grade, that's what they were doing
[00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:23.280]   is making movies.
[00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:28.080]   So does Google just leave in the cloud too much that it doesn't want to do things locally?
[00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:29.280]   It only wants to do cloud.
[00:46:29.280 --> 00:46:31.480]   That's the getting factor.
[00:46:31.480 --> 00:46:32.640]   That's a good question.
[00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:37.160]   Because again, you have people like Acer that are putting these products out here year after
[00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:40.640]   year that are clearly capable.
[00:46:40.640 --> 00:46:45.280]   But there's nothing being done about it from the software standpoint.
[00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:46.280]   Yeah.
[00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:51.400]   Apple kind of benefited from the fact that Adobe screwed Steve Jobs.
[00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:57.160]   And Steve was furious and said, "We're going to develop apps and we're going to put Adobe
[00:46:57.160 --> 00:46:58.400]   out of business."
[00:46:58.400 --> 00:47:02.520]   And the chief thing they did is acquire Final Cut and make Final Cut a very powerful video
[00:47:02.520 --> 00:47:07.320]   editing platform and then make it available or something like it available on all their
[00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:08.320]   hardware.
[00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:13.160]   So it's almost a historical accident that Apple has an advantage there.
[00:47:13.160 --> 00:47:16.280]   But they clearly do have an advantage there.
[00:47:16.280 --> 00:47:18.760]   And I think that Google could probably should.
[00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:23.640]   Now I haven't really ever thought about this but probably should put some effort into making
[00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:27.560]   a Chromebook because I think that's one of the things schools want to do.
[00:47:27.560 --> 00:47:29.600]   Yeah, if you just web apps.
[00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:32.920]   I don't think you're going to be web apps.
[00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:33.920]   I think you need...
[00:47:33.920 --> 00:47:36.120]   Yeah, it's going to be Android I think.
[00:47:36.120 --> 00:47:37.640]   Maybe that's why Android is there.
[00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:39.360]   See my prior discussion.
[00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:40.600]   Android is not ready for this.
[00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:41.600]   No.
[00:47:41.600 --> 00:47:45.840]   If it can't display Netflix well, you can't edit Netflix.
[00:47:45.840 --> 00:47:51.160]   So I have the dev channel is on here and yes, lo and behold, there is a...
[00:47:51.160 --> 00:47:53.000]   Let's see, let's get the glare off that screen.
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:54.760]   Can you zoom in on that Josh a little bit?
[00:47:54.760 --> 00:47:55.760]   It's right here.
[00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:56.760]   There it is.
[00:47:56.760 --> 00:47:58.260]   Linux beta.
[00:47:58.260 --> 00:48:00.800]   And I can tap that.
[00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:01.800]   Here we go.
[00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:02.800]   Let's do it again.
[00:48:02.800 --> 00:48:05.600]   It should install a terminal app.
[00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:08.120]   Turn on it says, okay.
[00:48:08.120 --> 00:48:09.120]   Terminal...
[00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:10.120]   Oh, so the first thing it does is terminal.
[00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:11.120]   Now there is a...
[00:48:11.120 --> 00:48:12.120]   There was a terminal.
[00:48:12.120 --> 00:48:13.120]   There's Crosch.
[00:48:13.120 --> 00:48:14.200]   Well, that's pretty bare bones.
[00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:16.600]   This is an actual terminal you'll see.
[00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:17.600]   Okay.
[00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:18.600]   That's nice.
[00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:20.480]   The terminal does SSH.
[00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:22.520]   Does it do MOSH?
[00:48:22.520 --> 00:48:24.280]   I have a very nice MOSH extension.
[00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:25.760]   I told you about MOSH.
[00:48:25.760 --> 00:48:26.760]   You did.
[00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:30.080]   Yeah, but very nice MOSH extension I use in Chrome OS.
[00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:31.080]   So I can...
[00:48:31.080 --> 00:48:36.920]   In effect, I just MOSH into my server at home, my Debian server at home and use it that
[00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:38.560]   way.
[00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:42.320]   But this will actually make these local so I can still work offline and stuff.
[00:48:42.320 --> 00:48:45.240]   So now starting container inside terminal VM.
[00:48:45.240 --> 00:48:47.280]   So terminal is more than a terminal.
[00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:48.280]   It's a...
[00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:53.400]   Terminal is the actual container.
[00:48:53.400 --> 00:48:54.400]   So this would be...
[00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:56.240]   Now, there are some video editing tools.
[00:48:56.240 --> 00:48:58.720]   There are tools on Linux, but nothing that polished.
[00:48:58.720 --> 00:49:00.040]   This would be a great opportunity.
[00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:03.120]   Google's got some good resources and dynamic programs.
[00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:08.960]   What a great opportunity for them to make an open source classroom quality.
[00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:10.840]   So it doesn't have to be file cut.
[00:49:10.840 --> 00:49:12.640]   It has to be iMovie.
[00:49:12.640 --> 00:49:13.640]   Video editor.
[00:49:13.640 --> 00:49:18.760]   Now, one more thing as far as the education, this is just something that reminded me of
[00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:22.520]   an experience a couple of weeks ago here in my home.
[00:49:22.520 --> 00:49:23.760]   Something happened on my computer.
[00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:24.760]   I believe it was...
[00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:27.680]   Yeah, I was running a Plex server.
[00:49:27.680 --> 00:49:30.040]   And I'm trying to watch it downstairs and it didn't work.
[00:49:30.040 --> 00:49:33.200]   So I needed to have the system reboot.
[00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:37.960]   So I yell upstairs to one of my boys and say, "Hey, I said, "Hey, I need you all to
[00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:40.680]   restart the Plex server for me."
[00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:44.560]   He walks over to the computer and I say, "Go to the start menu and I already have it pinned
[00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:46.320]   there in the start menu."
[00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:48.200]   He didn't know what a start menu was.
[00:49:48.200 --> 00:49:49.200]   Oh, wow.
[00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:55.520]   And it's because they spend so much time in the Chromebook world.
[00:49:55.520 --> 00:49:57.600]   He was totally beside himself.
[00:49:57.600 --> 00:50:04.160]   My granite, he will come to this desk and sit and fire up a fortnight or whatever to
[00:50:04.160 --> 00:50:07.000]   do what they need to do for school or what have you.
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:12.440]   But he had no idea about going in and out of the application menu here and stuff like
[00:50:12.440 --> 00:50:15.280]   Dad or looking at the services.
[00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:17.360]   But they don't teach that.
[00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:20.120]   So Termina is now installed.
[00:50:20.120 --> 00:50:22.880]   What's the next thing you do?
[00:50:22.880 --> 00:50:25.920]   Next thing you want to open up CROSCH.
[00:50:25.920 --> 00:50:29.320]   So it's a control alt T, I believe.
[00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:31.280]   All right.
[00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:34.760]   There's the old shelf.
[00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:35.760]   And then what I like to do.
[00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:37.600]   I want to type VMC.
[00:50:37.600 --> 00:50:39.560]   Let me see.
[00:50:39.560 --> 00:50:40.720]   I don't see anything yet.
[00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:42.280]   Hold on.
[00:50:42.280 --> 00:50:43.280]   Where's my command line?
[00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:44.920]   Yeah, where's your command line?
[00:50:44.920 --> 00:50:45.920]   There it is.
[00:50:45.920 --> 00:50:47.760]   It's somewhere off screen.
[00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:49.520]   VMC.
[00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:51.640]   Space start.
[00:50:51.640 --> 00:50:55.480]   Space Termina.
[00:50:55.480 --> 00:51:00.560]   So this is the virtual machine and Termina is the terminal that's going to start.
[00:51:00.560 --> 00:51:02.800]   Maybe I'm not really in CROSCH.
[00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:03.800]   What's going on?
[00:51:03.800 --> 00:51:05.800]   It has to be the best twig ever.
[00:51:05.800 --> 00:51:07.800]   Oh, yeah.
[00:51:07.800 --> 00:51:09.920]   VMC start.
[00:51:09.920 --> 00:51:10.920]   I don't know what's going on.
[00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:11.920]   Let me try this again.
[00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:14.160]   In my eyes, like wide open.
[00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:15.640]   I'm like, what's going to happen next?
[00:51:15.640 --> 00:51:16.640]   Let's close this.
[00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:18.640]   Control alt T.
[00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:22.440]   I don't, you know, I wonder if it's because I have MOSCH on there or something.
[00:51:22.440 --> 00:51:23.440]   I don't see the--
[00:51:23.440 --> 00:51:24.440]   That could be.
[00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:26.680]   Let's make it smaller.
[00:51:26.680 --> 00:51:31.480]   That doesn't help.
[00:51:31.480 --> 00:51:36.280]   Check in seeing your app list if you have a terminal.
[00:51:36.280 --> 00:51:48.480]   It's been flaky lately, but maybe yours will work.
[00:51:48.480 --> 00:51:51.600]   This is so much fun, aren't you glad you watched the show today?
[00:51:51.600 --> 00:51:54.240]   What is that?
[00:51:54.240 --> 00:51:56.160]   Art Canvas in a folder.
[00:51:56.160 --> 00:51:58.240]   Yeah, T.E.R.
[00:51:58.240 --> 00:51:59.640]   Just restart.
[00:51:59.640 --> 00:52:00.640]   Terminal.
[00:52:00.640 --> 00:52:01.640]   Should I--
[00:52:01.640 --> 00:52:02.640]   Yes.
[00:52:02.640 --> 00:52:03.640]   Terminal.
[00:52:03.640 --> 00:52:06.080]   Yeah, but it's the same problem.
[00:52:06.080 --> 00:52:08.520]   So what was it?
[00:52:08.520 --> 00:52:09.520]   Terminal.
[00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:10.520]   Start.
[00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:11.520]   No, it's VMC.
[00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:12.520]   No, VMC and CmStart.
[00:52:12.520 --> 00:52:13.520]   Terminal.
[00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:14.520]   Terminal.
[00:52:14.520 --> 00:52:15.520]   Right.
[00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:18.920]   I think that's virtual machine console.
[00:52:18.920 --> 00:52:19.920]   Yeah.
[00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:24.000]   So I don't know what's going on.
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:25.400]   Yeah, it's your--
[00:52:25.400 --> 00:52:28.000]   Well, there you go.
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:30.440]   That's why you wanted to solve Linux.
[00:52:30.440 --> 00:52:31.440]   On your Chromebook.
[00:52:31.440 --> 00:52:34.440]   I'll just keep rebooting until it works.
[00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:40.480]   It could be that you have MOS on there because I know they're using the Secure Shell app as
[00:52:40.480 --> 00:52:43.780]   a conduit here between Chrome OS and the Linux container.
[00:52:43.780 --> 00:52:47.320]   So you may want to get the official Secure Shell.
[00:52:47.320 --> 00:52:48.320]   I'll just take that.
[00:52:48.320 --> 00:52:50.920]   I might have some extensions on there that are causing Chrome.
[00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:52.320]   So no big deal.
[00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:54.120]   I'll keep banging on it.
[00:52:54.120 --> 00:52:55.120]   You see that's how you do it though?
[00:52:55.120 --> 00:52:56.120]   It'll be how you do it though.
[00:52:56.120 --> 00:52:57.120]   It'll be how you do it.
[00:52:57.120 --> 00:52:58.120]   August of 2023.
[00:52:58.120 --> 00:52:59.120]   There you go.
[00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:01.280]   Let's take a break when we come back.
[00:53:01.280 --> 00:53:02.280]   Lots more to talk about.
[00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:10.040]   The Hydrogen One, a new Android phone that is wildly ambitious and wildly expensive.
[00:53:10.040 --> 00:53:11.040]   And I want to--
[00:53:11.040 --> 00:53:15.600]   Somebody's going to have to explain to me what this new YouTube music is and how it's
[00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:17.960]   different from Google Play music.
[00:53:17.960 --> 00:53:20.240]   And whether it still includes Google Play.
[00:53:20.240 --> 00:53:23.080]   And what's going on?
[00:53:23.080 --> 00:53:24.880]   Google's so good at confusing people.
[00:53:24.880 --> 00:53:28.720]   And then Jeff will give us his handwritten notes on Mark Zuckerberg's meeting with the
[00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:29.720]   European Parliament.
[00:53:29.720 --> 00:53:32.160]   No, you didn't watch either.
[00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:34.800]   Probably was in the middle of the night.
[00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:39.160]   Yeah, we haven't done much Facebook stuff.
[00:53:39.160 --> 00:53:40.160]   So we have--
[00:53:40.160 --> 00:53:41.880]   You don't want to get nervous for him.
[00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:42.880]   I know.
[00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:48.840]   He's got this-- always seems to like have a thin sheen of sweat on him.
[00:53:48.840 --> 00:53:49.840]   Mm-hmm.
[00:53:49.840 --> 00:53:55.040]   I don't know if that's-- if he's actually sweating or his face is dipped in plastic.
[00:53:55.040 --> 00:53:59.680]   It doesn't add to his human-- humanity.
[00:53:59.680 --> 00:54:02.160]   Let's put it that way.
[00:54:02.160 --> 00:54:03.160]   All right.
[00:54:03.160 --> 00:54:07.480]   Our show today brought to you by Rocket Mortgage from Quicken Loans.
[00:54:07.480 --> 00:54:11.880]   The folks at Quicken Loans are watching with great interest tonight.
[00:54:11.880 --> 00:54:12.880]   What is it?
[00:54:12.880 --> 00:54:17.400]   Game five of the NBA playoffs, the Cleveland Cavaliers and the Boston Celtics.
[00:54:17.400 --> 00:54:24.680]   Of course, the Quicken Loans founder, Dan Gilbert is the owner of the Cleveland Cavaliers,
[00:54:24.680 --> 00:54:26.040]   who will be watching with interest.
[00:54:26.040 --> 00:54:29.880]   He's been a really instrumental in revitalizing downtown to try-- Quicken Loans is an amazing
[00:54:29.880 --> 00:54:30.880]   company.
[00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:31.880]   Fascinating company.
[00:54:31.880 --> 00:54:33.400]   Number one lender in the country now.
[00:54:33.400 --> 00:54:36.560]   Number one in customer satisfaction eight years in a row.
[00:54:36.560 --> 00:54:39.800]   And they realized something that I think was kind of an eye opener.
[00:54:39.800 --> 00:54:43.800]   They realized that the way it worked-- here you are on top.
[00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:45.240]   Everybody loves your stuff.
[00:54:45.240 --> 00:54:46.600]   This is what you look for in a company.
[00:54:46.600 --> 00:54:48.360]   And they said, no, it's not good enough.
[00:54:48.360 --> 00:54:51.080]   The way it works isn't right.
[00:54:51.080 --> 00:54:57.200]   But we think that mortgage experience needs a client-focused technological revolution.
[00:54:57.200 --> 00:54:58.480]   It needs to keep up with the time.
[00:54:58.480 --> 00:54:59.480]   So they reinvented it.
[00:54:59.480 --> 00:55:04.320]   They came up with Rocket Mortgage, an entirely online mortgage approval process.
[00:55:04.320 --> 00:55:06.320]   And they're justifiably proud of this thing.
[00:55:06.320 --> 00:55:07.920]   And they ought to be.
[00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:11.600]   Last time I bought a house four years ago, Lisa and I had to go to a bank.
[00:55:11.600 --> 00:55:15.680]   The guy had a sheaf of papers with all the latest rates.
[00:55:15.680 --> 00:55:18.040]   And he was very proud of his mortgage calculator.
[00:55:18.040 --> 00:55:22.160]   And he licked his fingers and he turned the pages and finally--
[00:55:22.160 --> 00:55:25.880]   we're going, oh, I said, all right, well, can we have some money for a house?
[00:55:25.880 --> 00:55:29.240]   He said, all right, well, here's the application, kid.
[00:55:29.240 --> 00:55:30.400]   Gives you a stack of papers.
[00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:31.400]   Go home.
[00:55:31.400 --> 00:55:32.240]   Do some research.
[00:55:32.240 --> 00:55:34.960]   You've got to find your pay stubs and bank statements.
[00:55:34.960 --> 00:55:38.960]   All this old stuff, you've got to fill out this long application, send it to them.
[00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:40.080]   And they ask for more stuff.
[00:55:40.080 --> 00:55:41.240]   And you fax it to them.
[00:55:41.240 --> 00:55:42.200]   It took us two months.
[00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:45.200]   Now, it wouldn't probably take two months for most people for some reason.
[00:55:45.200 --> 00:55:49.520]   It just went on and on and on.
[00:55:49.520 --> 00:55:51.840]   I am so ready for rocket mortgage.
[00:55:51.840 --> 00:55:55.520]   The whole thing, as little as 10 minutes, you don't go to a bank.
[00:55:55.520 --> 00:56:02.920]   All you do is you go to rocketmortgage.com/twig on your computer, your tablet, your phone.
[00:56:02.920 --> 00:56:03.920]   The answer, a couple of questions.
[00:56:03.920 --> 00:56:04.920]   You don't even need to do any research.
[00:56:04.920 --> 00:56:05.920]   You already know the answer.
[00:56:05.920 --> 00:56:10.480]   And then because rocket mortgage has trusted partners with all the financial institutions,
[00:56:10.480 --> 00:56:14.720]   they can get the information they need with your permission, like that.
[00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:17.960]   They crunch the numbers based on your income, your assets, and your credit.
[00:56:17.960 --> 00:56:21.640]   Within 10 minutes, they're abouts.
[00:56:21.640 --> 00:56:24.640]   They'll analyze all the home loan options for which you qualify and find one that's just
[00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:26.160]   right for you.
[00:56:26.160 --> 00:56:28.480]   And they put a big green button on the phone that you could show the realtor.
[00:56:28.480 --> 00:56:30.520]   We're approved.
[00:56:30.520 --> 00:56:32.760]   It's really simple.
[00:56:32.760 --> 00:56:33.760]   And it's completely transparent.
[00:56:33.760 --> 00:56:35.120]   You'll know exactly what you're getting.
[00:56:35.120 --> 00:56:38.600]   You choose the rate, the term, the down payment.
[00:56:38.600 --> 00:56:39.880]   Rocket mortgage from quick and loans.
[00:56:39.880 --> 00:56:40.880]   Apply simply.
[00:56:40.880 --> 00:56:43.120]   Understand fully mortgage confidently.
[00:56:43.120 --> 00:56:47.000]   To get started, go to rocketmortgage.com/twig.
[00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:53.960]   Rocketmortgage.com/twig=housing/lenderlicensed in all 50 states and MLS consumer access.org
[00:56:53.960 --> 00:56:55.960]   number 30, 30.
[00:56:55.960 --> 00:56:56.960]   Couldn't be easier.
[00:56:56.960 --> 00:56:59.040]   Couldn't be faster.
[00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:00.680]   Rocketmortgage.com/twig.
[00:57:00.680 --> 00:57:03.080]   You got to admire a company that's on top.
[00:57:03.080 --> 00:57:06.840]   It's number one and says, "Yep, but we can do better."
[00:57:06.840 --> 00:57:07.840]   Rocketmortgage.com/twig.
[00:57:07.840 --> 00:57:16.360]   Oh, I must be on an old page because it says, "Google's about to launch a Gmail web read
[00:57:16.360 --> 00:57:17.360]   design."
[00:57:17.360 --> 00:57:18.360]   That's old.
[00:57:18.360 --> 00:57:19.360]   That's old.
[00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:20.360]   They did it.
[00:57:20.360 --> 00:57:21.360]   It's already done.
[00:57:21.360 --> 00:57:25.320]   Red one, the new Hydrogen one from red.
[00:57:25.320 --> 00:57:27.640]   We're trying to get one.
[00:57:27.640 --> 00:57:34.680]   If you want to buy one, $1,200 or if you have the titanium edition, $1,600, this is an Android
[00:57:34.680 --> 00:57:36.640]   phone unlike any other.
[00:57:36.640 --> 00:57:39.240]   5.7-inch display.
[00:57:39.240 --> 00:57:40.240]   Beautiful.
[00:57:40.240 --> 00:57:41.240]   That's all?
[00:57:41.240 --> 00:57:42.240]   Metal case.
[00:57:42.240 --> 00:57:43.880]   Yes, not that big, is it?
[00:57:43.880 --> 00:57:46.000]   That's all he says.
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:48.680]   It will be shipped through Verizon or AT&T.
[00:57:48.680 --> 00:57:50.080]   That's a big deal for Red.
[00:57:50.080 --> 00:57:51.640]   That shows that they've...
[00:57:51.640 --> 00:57:55.280]   That was something that other companies had a hard time doing.
[00:57:55.280 --> 00:58:00.280]   What they're promising is they're the modules.
[00:58:00.280 --> 00:58:03.920]   They have these pins at the bottom and they're promising modules.
[00:58:03.920 --> 00:58:08.080]   Really like you, I would imagine, would be very interested in all of this because Red
[00:58:08.080 --> 00:58:11.040]   has such a great reputation for 4K and 5K.
[00:58:11.040 --> 00:58:13.600]   I was interested until I saw $1,600.
[00:58:13.600 --> 00:58:14.600]   Yes.
[00:58:14.600 --> 00:58:15.840]   Well, that's just for titanium.
[00:58:15.840 --> 00:58:18.680]   $1,200 for aluminum.
[00:58:18.680 --> 00:58:19.680]   I can...
[00:58:19.680 --> 00:58:22.880]   Then what will the extra module cost?
[00:58:22.880 --> 00:58:23.880]   That's a good question.
[00:58:23.880 --> 00:58:24.880]   Right.
[00:58:24.880 --> 00:58:25.880]   Yes.
[00:58:25.880 --> 00:58:31.840]   Well, the chat room knows because they just link to the red Lucid 8K camera.
[00:58:31.840 --> 00:58:32.840]   Oh, so...
[00:58:32.840 --> 00:58:37.600]   I assume you attach the phone to.
[00:58:37.600 --> 00:58:42.000]   I know this phone has some kind of holographic 4D type technology.
[00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:44.400]   I don't get excited about that.
[00:58:44.400 --> 00:58:46.000]   The front camera looks like that.
[00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:47.240]   We've seen that before.
[00:58:47.240 --> 00:58:51.400]   My guess is it attaches to this even more expensive 8K camera.
[00:58:51.400 --> 00:58:52.400]   All right.
[00:58:52.400 --> 00:58:54.280]   Let me see if I can find this.
[00:58:54.280 --> 00:58:56.000]   Is it used as a monitor?
[00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:57.000]   Yes.
[00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:58.000]   A controller.
[00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:01.040]   I sort of think somehow it integrates into the...
[00:59:01.040 --> 00:59:02.040]   Yes.
[00:59:02.040 --> 00:59:03.040]   It's if you find it.
[00:59:03.040 --> 00:59:05.040]   The red system.
[00:59:05.040 --> 00:59:06.040]   Right?
[00:59:06.040 --> 00:59:07.800]   So it would make sense if you were all...
[00:59:07.800 --> 00:59:11.960]   If your mark is brown-lane, you're all in on red, it would make sense.
[00:59:11.960 --> 00:59:13.960]   I don't think it makes sense for him.
[00:59:13.960 --> 00:59:14.960]   Yeah.
[00:59:14.960 --> 00:59:23.080]   Because if what you need this phone is going to do is give me an additional monitor to
[00:59:23.080 --> 00:59:26.000]   see what my lens is seeing.
[00:59:26.000 --> 00:59:31.800]   He has a gazillion monitors in his little closet right there that are all vivid quality.
[00:59:31.800 --> 00:59:32.800]   Right.
[00:59:32.800 --> 00:59:34.440]   He's not going to need this.
[00:59:34.440 --> 00:59:37.080]   Oh, you're overlooking what he's going to get though.
[00:59:37.080 --> 00:59:42.120]   He's going to get that proprietary HV4 format that is exclusive to red cameras.
[00:59:42.120 --> 00:59:45.040]   So your video is going to be in a new format.
[00:59:45.040 --> 00:59:47.040]   So here's the petapixel...
[00:59:47.040 --> 00:59:48.040]   Yeah, right.
[00:59:48.040 --> 00:59:50.840]   It's not going to be compressed to crap on YouTube.
[00:59:50.840 --> 00:59:55.920]   8K3D camera for 4V holographic photos.
[00:59:55.920 --> 00:59:58.640]   You know you want this, Ant.
[00:59:58.640 --> 01:00:00.120]   I don't even know what it means.
[01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:01.120]   But I know you want it.
[01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:04.280]   See, we have a game here on Twig.
[01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:05.760]   Yeah.
[01:00:05.760 --> 01:00:07.560]   What should Ant get?
[01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:12.160]   No, we try to get Leo to actually buy something ridiculous and make him spend money.
[01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:15.760]   So I think our game today is trying to get you to order this before the show is over.
[01:00:15.760 --> 01:00:16.760]   No way.
[01:00:16.760 --> 01:00:19.600]   Now we are trying to get this phone for review.
[01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:20.880]   I'm not buying it.
[01:00:20.880 --> 01:00:29.360]   So Lucid makes $500 3D VR180 camera.
[01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:33.000]   And they're going to work with red to make this 8K3D camera.
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:36.360]   It won't be available to the fourth quarter of 2018.
[01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:38.720]   No pricing available.
[01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:39.720]   So...
[01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:42.480]   I like the ambition.
[01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:51.400]   But I just don't know that all of that stuff is necessary right now for consumers.
[01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:54.640]   People barely give a crap about VR.
[01:00:54.640 --> 01:01:01.280]   You know, because it's just not necessarily convenient for people.
[01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:02.840]   You know, people just want to pick a phone.
[01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:03.840]   So I know what 3D is.
[01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:06.840]   What's 4V?
[01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:08.480]   I thought that was the holographic part.
[01:01:08.480 --> 01:01:09.480]   Oh, that's the holographic.
[01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:10.480]   It is.
[01:01:10.480 --> 01:01:11.480]   4V.
[01:01:11.480 --> 01:01:16.760]   They wouldn't let anybody film that when they showed this off because they said it doesn't
[01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:18.040]   translate well on camera.
[01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:20.600]   So nobody was allowed to film the 4V stuff.
[01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:22.160]   So I have not seen it.
[01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:24.920]   So this is a DLKades article in DP Review.
[01:01:24.920 --> 01:01:26.520]   I think he's the guy who actually broke this.
[01:01:26.520 --> 01:01:28.720]   So let's give DL a credit here.
[01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:34.560]   Now didn't they also mention the potential of being able to add an image sensor to the
[01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:36.280]   back of that phone?
[01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:37.280]   To where you can...
[01:01:37.280 --> 01:01:38.280]   That's what I thought they were.
[01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:39.280]   That's what I thought they were.
[01:01:39.280 --> 01:01:40.280]   I thought they were going to.
[01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:41.280]   Yeah.
[01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:42.280]   Put another lens on the back of it.
[01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:44.640]   And I'd be okay with that.
[01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:46.560]   But again, I looked at the bottom line.
[01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:49.800]   It cost me $1200 for the phone.
[01:01:49.800 --> 01:01:53.520]   It's going to cost me $X amount of dollars for the image sensor.
[01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:55.600]   And I already have a lens.
[01:01:55.600 --> 01:01:59.240]   So you basically just buying yourself a new camera and one of the things that's...
[01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:00.240]   Does it make sense?
[01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:01.240]   Why can't it have the phone?
[01:02:01.240 --> 01:02:02.240]   Yeah.
[01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:03.240]   No, I'm with you.
[01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:04.240]   Yeah.
[01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:05.240]   Yeah.
[01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:06.240]   Well...
[01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:07.240]   And I like red.
[01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:08.240]   Because it's 6.
[01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:09.240]   But it just...
[01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:10.240]   That just doesn't make sense to me.
[01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:11.240]   Sexy as hell.
[01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:12.240]   Sexy.
[01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:15.160]   All right.
[01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:16.600]   So Ant's not buying a Chromebook.
[01:02:16.600 --> 01:02:17.760]   He's not buying the red.
[01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:18.760]   We're trying.
[01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:20.520]   We're trying to get you to buy something.
[01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:22.440]   It's a new game.
[01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:26.160]   It is the summertime in the south and it's all raining clouds.
[01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:30.840]   So I'm just going to keep bringing clouds to this episode.
[01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:34.360]   So YouTube launched...
[01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:35.360]   Have they launched that YouTube music?
[01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:36.360]   They launched it, right?
[01:02:36.360 --> 01:02:37.360]   Or no?
[01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:38.360]   Is it still...
[01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:39.360]   It started going out to early people...
[01:02:39.360 --> 01:02:40.360]   Yes, true.
[01:02:40.360 --> 01:02:41.360]   Yeah.
[01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:42.360]   Yeah.
[01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:43.360]   Yeah.
[01:02:43.360 --> 01:02:44.360]   YouTube Red is going away.
[01:02:44.360 --> 01:02:46.040]   We hardly knew ye.
[01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:49.680]   It's being replaced by YouTube Premium.
[01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:52.840]   But if you're already a Google Play subscriber, you've got it, right?
[01:02:52.840 --> 01:02:53.840]   It's the same thing.
[01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:55.280]   Yes, you will have it.
[01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:57.040]   You won't be upcharged or anything.
[01:02:57.040 --> 01:02:58.040]   That's correct.
[01:02:58.040 --> 01:02:59.840]   You'll be grandfathered in.
[01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:01.120]   But what do you change brands?
[01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:03.600]   Do you no longer use Google Play instead of you use YouTube?
[01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:04.920]   How does that work?
[01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:08.200]   They're going to actually keep Google Play music around.
[01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:09.200]   But you can now...
[01:03:09.200 --> 01:03:13.840]   If you're in the early access program, you can get the YouTube music app and look at
[01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:15.240]   everything there instead.
[01:03:15.240 --> 01:03:20.400]   So you could probably use either or until they retire Google Play music.
[01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:21.840]   It is a little confusing.
[01:03:21.840 --> 01:03:24.280]   Part of it to me is a branding thing.
[01:03:24.280 --> 01:03:25.280]   They're still...
[01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:28.320]   Just like we talked about at the beginning of the show, there's a negative connotation
[01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:31.120]   in some areas with the word Google.
[01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:33.240]   But everybody that seems to love YouTube.
[01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:34.240]   Yeah.
[01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:36.840]   I just think that's part of the strategy here.
[01:03:36.840 --> 01:03:42.760]   So there's a soft launch started yesterday, $10 a month for YouTube music.
[01:03:42.760 --> 01:03:45.400]   And that service will eventually replace Google Play music.
[01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:47.400]   It's all going to be YouTube music.
[01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:53.760]   But if you want the ad-free YouTube, that's going to cost more.
[01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:57.320]   Another $2 a month for YouTube premium.
[01:03:57.320 --> 01:04:03.880]   So $10 for YouTube music, plus $2 for YouTube premium for ad-free YouTube content.
[01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:05.880]   $12 a month.
[01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:06.880]   That's the original.
[01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:10.120]   It's the new YouTube original stuff from Red.
[01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:17.040]   The music moves ads for music videos only, but not from the rest of YouTube.
[01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:21.880]   YouTube premium at $12 moves ads from everywhere like YouTube Red does.
[01:04:21.880 --> 01:04:23.160]   Now if you're...
[01:04:23.160 --> 01:04:24.160]   Your grand...
[01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:25.160]   Okay.
[01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:27.080]   This is the chart they had to make.
[01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:29.280]   Your grandfathered in.
[01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:33.240]   Your grandfathered in, if you have an existing YouTube Red account, you're going to continue
[01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:37.600]   to pay $10 a month.
[01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:41.480]   So there you have it.
[01:04:41.480 --> 01:04:42.880]   No news on family plans.
[01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:44.800]   And that was something that I would need to know.
[01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:45.800]   That's a problem.
[01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:46.800]   Yeah, I pay for the family plan.
[01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:49.400]   It'd be nice if our grandfathered in on that.
[01:04:49.400 --> 01:04:51.320]   That would be good.
[01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:56.920]   Google Play tweeted me and said with a nice exclamation point, "Nothing is changing with
[01:04:56.920 --> 01:04:59.360]   Google Play music exclamation point.
[01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:04.560]   If you have Google Play music subscription/family plan, you'll continue to get its benefits."
[01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:05.560]   Good.
[01:05:05.560 --> 01:05:06.560]   Which means...
[01:05:06.560 --> 01:05:07.560]   You can keep your health plan.
[01:05:07.560 --> 01:05:08.560]   Where have we heard it?
[01:05:08.560 --> 01:05:10.560]   And your doctor.
[01:05:10.560 --> 01:05:11.960]   Well, that means...
[01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:14.720]   Because that means we still get...
[01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:15.720]   We get red too, right?
[01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:16.720]   Don't we...
[01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:17.720]   And we get...
[01:05:17.720 --> 01:05:18.720]   That's how I...
[01:05:18.720 --> 01:05:19.720]   Yeah.
[01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:20.720]   It's just how I take it.
[01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:21.720]   So we'll get all the features.
[01:05:21.720 --> 01:05:22.720]   You can for red.
[01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:23.720]   Yeah.
[01:05:23.720 --> 01:05:24.720]   We pay 15 chains a month.
[01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:25.720]   And we get a family plan.
[01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:28.480]   We get all the music plus YouTube red.
[01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:32.280]   And we will continue to have that if the tweet is correct.
[01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:33.520]   That's how I read it.
[01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:34.520]   Thank you, Obama.
[01:05:34.520 --> 01:05:39.880]   It was a funny thread that people jumped on after Google sent that to me because they
[01:05:39.880 --> 01:05:42.280]   continued to ask questions.
[01:05:42.280 --> 01:05:45.080]   And then it got to the point where Google's...
[01:05:45.080 --> 01:05:49.160]   The Google Play music Twitter account said, "Yeah, we appreciate all of the feedback.
[01:05:49.160 --> 01:05:53.440]   Just go ahead and submit your suggestions and stuff through the feedback captions."
[01:05:53.440 --> 01:05:58.720]   And everybody just went nuts and was like, "Man, we've been doing that for years.
[01:05:58.720 --> 01:06:00.720]   Your feedback does nothing here."
[01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:01.720]   You know?
[01:06:01.720 --> 01:06:04.720]   All right.
[01:06:04.720 --> 01:06:06.520]   Well, good.
[01:06:06.520 --> 01:06:08.320]   I'm still confused.
[01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:09.920]   Of course, I'm going to complain.
[01:06:09.920 --> 01:06:16.520]   So I have my Google Play stuff is all under my Gmail account because that's all I can get
[01:06:16.520 --> 01:06:18.820]   at the time.
[01:06:18.820 --> 01:06:20.840]   But my YouTube red is under my...
[01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:21.840]   Google Apps.
[01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:22.840]   G Suite account.
[01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:23.840]   G Suite account.
[01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:24.840]   G Suite account.
[01:06:24.840 --> 01:06:25.840]   G Suite account.
[01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:26.840]   Yeah.
[01:06:26.840 --> 01:06:27.840]   Google.
[01:06:27.840 --> 01:06:28.840]   Google.
[01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:31.840]   Google.
[01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:34.440]   I don't put anything under G Suite.
[01:06:34.440 --> 01:06:35.440]   No G Suite.
[01:06:35.440 --> 01:06:38.440]   Never had a number right now.
[01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:45.760]   One time my card expired and I needed to switch it over to a new card.
[01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:48.040]   And it just totally slipped my mind.
[01:06:48.040 --> 01:06:52.360]   But I went to watch YouTube on the television one day and these ads kept popping up.
[01:06:52.360 --> 01:06:53.360]   Oh, isn't it awful?
[01:06:53.360 --> 01:06:55.360]   It was the most annoying.
[01:06:55.360 --> 01:06:57.680]   And I'm like, "I know I have read, what the heck happened?"
[01:06:57.680 --> 01:06:58.960]   And then I checked my email.
[01:06:58.960 --> 01:06:59.960]   Oh, yeah.
[01:06:59.960 --> 01:07:00.960]   Update your card.
[01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:06.920]   So it is totally worth paying that extra money for me anyway.
[01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:12.080]   I'm rebooting this to see if I get Linux to go.
[01:07:12.080 --> 01:07:13.080]   All right.
[01:07:13.080 --> 01:07:14.080]   So there you go.
[01:07:14.080 --> 01:07:16.000]   We've confused you even further.
[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:21.600]   Facebook's Android app got a little heat.
[01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:31.560]   We talked about this on security now yesterday looking for super user permissions.
[01:07:31.560 --> 01:07:36.800]   Facebook's Android app requesting access privileges including super user access to a device which
[01:07:36.800 --> 01:07:40.240]   gives it full control over the handheld.
[01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:41.480]   This is something new.
[01:07:41.480 --> 01:07:44.520]   It's probably a bug.
[01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:46.080]   Now I wouldn't be able to see this.
[01:07:46.080 --> 01:07:51.240]   I think you'd have to be running the software that gives you root access, right?
[01:07:51.240 --> 01:07:53.160]   This is super user request.
[01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:55.200]   I'm not going to see that.
[01:07:55.200 --> 01:07:59.360]   Grant's full access to your device to deny if you're not sure.
[01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:00.800]   It says forever.
[01:08:00.800 --> 01:08:01.800]   Forever.
[01:08:01.800 --> 01:08:02.800]   Forever.
[01:08:02.800 --> 01:08:03.800]   Okay.
[01:08:03.800 --> 01:08:11.040]   That's a bug, I think.
[01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:12.040]   Just maybe.
[01:08:12.040 --> 01:08:13.040]   Yeah.
[01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:16.880]   All right.
[01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:21.240]   So I don't think here's yeah, here's Facebook's response.
[01:08:21.240 --> 01:08:25.560]   A coding error and one of our anti fraud systems causes a small number of people running
[01:08:25.560 --> 01:08:28.960]   the Facebook app and certain permission management apps on rooted Android phones.
[01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:32.160]   Yeah, you'd have to have a rooted already rooted phone to see requests for additional
[01:08:32.160 --> 01:08:33.160]   access permissions.
[01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:36.880]   We do not need nor do we want those permissions.
[01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:37.880]   And we.
[01:08:37.880 --> 01:08:40.920]   So you know, this is a case where they make a big deal.
[01:08:40.920 --> 01:08:41.920]   Oh my God.
[01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:44.240]   Facebook's going after your whole phone, but yeah, yeah, they screwed up.
[01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:45.720]   But in a few phones, geez.
[01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:48.760]   And yeah, it doesn't affect most people unless you've already rooted your phone.
[01:08:48.760 --> 01:08:50.760]   Oh, root phone is rooted.
[01:08:50.760 --> 01:08:53.440]   That's that's the bottom line there.
[01:08:53.440 --> 01:08:55.840]   You already you already got it.
[01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:56.840]   All right.
[01:08:56.840 --> 01:08:57.840]   Good.
[01:08:57.840 --> 01:08:58.840]   That's cleared up.
[01:08:58.840 --> 01:08:59.840]   You can move on.
[01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:01.480]   Actually defend Facebook there.
[01:09:01.480 --> 01:09:02.480]   Yes.
[01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:03.480]   So once.
[01:09:03.480 --> 01:09:06.480]   So did you read any notes about Mark's meeting with the European Parliament?
[01:09:06.480 --> 01:09:09.720]   I saw some one headline that said 40 questions.
[01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:11.880]   Mark's couldn't answer, but said, we'll get back to you.
[01:09:11.880 --> 01:09:12.880]   So he's up to that again.
[01:09:12.880 --> 01:09:13.880]   Definitely.
[01:09:13.880 --> 01:09:14.880]   Yeah.
[01:09:14.880 --> 01:09:17.960]   The four people who went after him the worst, but it also included.
[01:09:17.960 --> 01:09:19.880]   Oh, no, I've got a senior.
[01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:22.880]   What's the name of the guy who came over who did all the Brexit stuff who came over and
[01:09:22.880 --> 01:09:23.880]   back Trump?
[01:09:23.880 --> 01:09:25.880]   Oh, Nigel Faj.
[01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:27.760]   So Faj is there.
[01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:30.880]   This is the hardest part of a frosh is there saying Brexit couldn't have happened without
[01:09:30.880 --> 01:09:31.880]   you.
[01:09:31.880 --> 01:09:32.880]   Oh, great.
[01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:33.880]   Thanks.
[01:09:33.880 --> 01:09:36.800]   But friends like that.
[01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:39.160]   Yeah, who needs Congress?
[01:09:39.160 --> 01:09:42.800]   I heard the format of the whole thing was weird.
[01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:46.760]   They basically asked question after question after question for like most of the time and
[01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:51.920]   then said, go and he answered the ones he wanted and then he ran out of time.
[01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:52.920]   That's terrible.
[01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:53.920]   Yeah.
[01:09:53.920 --> 01:09:58.120]   He kind of got to pick what he wanted to answer what from what I read.
[01:09:58.120 --> 01:10:02.360]   I did not see the live stream in all fairness, but I kept seeing tweets.
[01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:05.840]   There's only seven minutes and he has 50 questions to go.
[01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:08.920]   And that's I would just fill a buster like crazy.
[01:10:08.920 --> 01:10:10.160]   Yeah.
[01:10:10.160 --> 01:10:14.040]   I think he did because he said, you know, I want to be aware of our time.
[01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:19.440]   I think we only have a few minutes left.
[01:10:19.440 --> 01:10:22.680]   So get ready for a digital ad offensive.
[01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:30.880]   You might have already seen them from demand progress, demanding that the FTC breakup Facebook
[01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:37.720]   that they that Facebook get rid of Instagram, WhatsApp and messenger into their own separate
[01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:38.720]   apps.
[01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:41.920]   What does that do?
[01:10:41.920 --> 01:10:45.120]   So each app can do the things that these people make.
[01:10:45.120 --> 01:10:46.760]   Well, I'm unclear.
[01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:48.800]   Maybe they mean spin it off at a separate company, right?
[01:10:48.800 --> 01:10:49.800]   Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:50.800]   So each of those.
[01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:52.800]   So there's things they don't like about Facebook.
[01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:56.160]   So there's now four companies that do things you don't like.
[01:10:56.160 --> 01:10:58.440]   How does that fix anything?
[01:10:58.440 --> 01:10:59.440]   Well, they're weaker.
[01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:02.720]   They're not they're not all unified under the same roof.
[01:11:02.720 --> 01:11:06.080]   So so if you're a smaller company, you can do whatever the heck you want.
[01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:07.720]   It's just when you get bigs at the problem.
[01:11:07.720 --> 01:11:12.040]   Now that we've now gotten to the essence of it, only size is the same.
[01:11:12.040 --> 01:11:13.040]   Success is the same.
[01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:15.040]   No, not success size.
[01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:18.840]   Well, success is the size.
[01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:24.800]   Yeah, but the issue is that all of that power under one roof is risky.
[01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:25.800]   You want competition.
[01:11:25.800 --> 01:11:27.720]   Don't you want competition, Jeff?
[01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:32.040]   Yeah, but what I'm saying, what I'm trying to say here is that if Facebook were alone
[01:11:32.040 --> 01:11:36.120]   as Facebook without all the other things, everything people are complaining about Facebook
[01:11:36.120 --> 01:11:37.120]   doing.
[01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:39.120]   And still do others would still do.
[01:11:39.120 --> 01:11:44.000]   Well, if Facebook could still do and I mean, if you really want to make the argument stronger,
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:49.720]   you could say, and this historically has never worked, just look at the AT&T breakup.
[01:11:49.720 --> 01:11:50.720]   And Microsoft.
[01:11:50.720 --> 01:11:51.720]   Yeah.
[01:11:51.720 --> 01:11:52.720]   Well, but they never did break up Microsoft.
[01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:53.720]   They wanted to.
[01:11:53.720 --> 01:11:54.720]   Well, but they didn't need to.
[01:11:54.720 --> 01:11:55.720]   Yeah.
[01:11:55.720 --> 01:11:56.720]   Yeah.
[01:11:56.720 --> 01:12:01.880]   Wasn't it rumored that the the WhatsApp CEO decided to just go ahead and bow because of
[01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:04.320]   the privacy practices that were going on?
[01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:06.320]   Yeah, and come got the hell out of there.
[01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:09.240]   You know, yeah, they're both gone now.
[01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:12.560]   One of them was calling for people to stop using Facebook.
[01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:15.680]   And then Yankum who was still there left recently.
[01:12:15.680 --> 01:12:19.360]   I mean, that says a lot right there.
[01:12:19.360 --> 01:12:23.840]   I mean, you have to admit, Jeff, that there is there, there was a strategic reason for
[01:12:23.840 --> 01:12:30.000]   Facebook to acquire those apps and yes, and to take messenger and spin it out.
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:31.840]   But they're not making it in the blue app.
[01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:32.840]   Yes.
[01:12:32.840 --> 01:12:37.920]   They occupy more of your phone surface and they and all the notifications and they get
[01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:38.920]   more of your eyeballs.
[01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:39.920]   They get more of your attention.
[01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:40.920]   They get more of your data.
[01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:43.360]   So they see there's a benefit in that.
[01:12:43.360 --> 01:12:44.360]   Okay.
[01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:45.360]   Right.
[01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:46.360]   Right.
[01:12:46.360 --> 01:12:49.440]   But then all they're trying to all this organizations trying to do is just punish them as opposed
[01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:52.440]   to identifying a problem and saying, here's a solution.
[01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:54.600]   I don't hear the problem and I don't see the solution.
[01:12:54.600 --> 01:12:58.800]   I don't know if it's punished them or maybe make them a little less dominant.
[01:12:58.800 --> 01:13:04.240]   But again, to solve what the problem precisely and then how does this solve that problem?
[01:13:04.240 --> 01:13:10.480]   Well, wouldn't you agree that having the more information that a single entity has about
[01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:18.560]   you, the more effectively they can target you and abuse your privacy and so forth?
[01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:22.640]   Well, if you were to split that silo all of that information up into little chunks, it
[01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:23.640]   wouldn't be as bad.
[01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:24.640]   The problem is it's accurate.
[01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:27.640]   No, I still think A, the organization doesn't really identify the problem.
[01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:29.720]   Okay, you would identify the problem.
[01:13:29.720 --> 01:13:31.280]   Too much data about me.
[01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:36.480]   Facebook on its own without WhatsApp, Instagram and emails would all will still be there.
[01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:38.120]   So I agree.
[01:13:38.120 --> 01:13:40.840]   So what you're saying is they should go even farther.
[01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:44.720]   No, I'm saying that this is just an effort to get attention.
[01:13:44.720 --> 01:13:46.600]   It's never going to happen to this administration.
[01:13:46.600 --> 01:13:47.600]   It's absolutely ridiculous.
[01:13:47.600 --> 01:13:49.800]   And we're given them what they want right now.
[01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:50.800]   Okay enough.
[01:13:50.800 --> 01:13:53.560]   I feel like the foreact.
[01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:56.960]   No, yeah, no, that's okay.
[01:13:56.960 --> 01:13:58.160]   We need somebody like that.
[01:13:58.160 --> 01:13:59.160]   Yeah.
[01:13:59.160 --> 01:14:00.160]   Yeah.
[01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:02.160]   I love watching the horns come out.
[01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:04.440]   How about this one?
[01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:05.800]   New York Times article.
[01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:07.440]   You get them really excited now.
[01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:11.240]   Amazon is selling face recognition to the police.
[01:14:11.240 --> 01:14:13.000]   This is a problem.
[01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:14.920]   This is an issue.
[01:14:14.920 --> 01:14:22.440]   So Amazon has for some time now a service called recognition with a K, which is kind
[01:14:22.440 --> 01:14:30.360]   of a Kafkaesque name that uses Amazon's cloud services to do face recognition.
[01:14:30.360 --> 01:14:34.640]   Orlando Police Department of Florida, Washington County Sheriff's Office in Oregon have both
[01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:36.440]   used it on yesterday.
[01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:42.120]   The ACLU asked them along with two dozen civil rights organizations asked Amazon to stop
[01:14:42.120 --> 01:14:47.920]   selling recognition to law enforcement because the police could use it for all sorts of nefarious
[01:14:47.920 --> 01:14:48.920]   things.
[01:14:48.920 --> 01:14:51.080]   I think this is also what Jeff I would submit.
[01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:52.680]   This is similar to what you're talking about.
[01:14:52.680 --> 01:14:56.600]   I mean, face recognition can have lots of value and the Amazon video showed a lot of
[01:14:56.600 --> 01:14:59.280]   If I can find missing children and criminals.
[01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:00.280]   Yes.
[01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:05.680]   Disney, they pointed out Disneyland uses it to find missing kids and does a very effective
[01:15:05.680 --> 01:15:07.680]   job of it.
[01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:09.560]   New York Times also admitted in the same article.
[01:15:09.560 --> 01:15:14.560]   They've used it because it was hard to figure out who was who during the royal wedding.
[01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:20.280]   So they used it to get, you know, face that's Princess Abby.
[01:15:20.280 --> 01:15:26.240]   He's a third generation fourth removed from the, you know, and of course, remember Google
[01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:30.200]   300 people quit Google because Google was working on face recognition for the Defense
[01:15:30.200 --> 01:15:33.200]   Department for drones.
[01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:36.680]   So the problem is face recognition has can have both great benefits.
[01:15:36.680 --> 01:15:37.680]   Yeah.
[01:15:37.680 --> 01:15:41.640]   The problem is that we don't trust any institution these days, corporate or government.
[01:15:41.640 --> 01:15:45.600]   And I think for law enforcement, face recognition can be very valuable.
[01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:53.280]   But it's also scary and companies I think need to have some kind of moral compass for
[01:15:53.280 --> 01:15:54.280]   these decisions.
[01:15:54.280 --> 01:15:56.240]   I agree.
[01:15:56.240 --> 01:16:02.200]   We talk about this on tomorrow's IoT podcast because there was a question about what data
[01:16:02.200 --> 01:16:03.720]   is actually being analyzed here.
[01:16:03.720 --> 01:16:08.200]   And I think the police departments uploaded like mug shots and other data, other photos
[01:16:08.200 --> 01:16:09.200]   they had.
[01:16:09.200 --> 01:16:14.120]   The reason we talk about it in this way is because, you know, you have the ring neighbors
[01:16:14.120 --> 01:16:18.080]   thing going with the doorbell, you know, we're talking about where they can sell not sell,
[01:16:18.080 --> 01:16:22.440]   but send information to the police in your area or the police can actually request that
[01:16:22.440 --> 01:16:26.760]   information if you're part of the neighbors program to help with a crime and has to be
[01:16:26.760 --> 01:16:27.760]   an open case file.
[01:16:27.760 --> 01:16:31.560]   It can't just be, we want to go look through the data.
[01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:36.040]   But my fear is that people just start thinking, well, gee, all the Amazon cameras and, you
[01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:40.400]   know, because they have the, they own blink, which is a camera company and so on.
[01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:44.720]   I don't see this being used, at least to my understanding on that information.
[01:16:44.720 --> 01:16:49.400]   It's not like Amazon is looking at your camera data and trying to recognize things.
[01:16:49.400 --> 01:16:50.640]   Could that happen in the future?
[01:16:50.640 --> 01:16:51.640]   Sure.
[01:16:51.640 --> 01:16:55.680]   This happens to be law enforcement and it seems to be a limited set of data.
[01:16:55.680 --> 01:16:59.760]   There's definitely perils here, but I kind of felt it was a little overblown in terms
[01:16:59.760 --> 01:17:01.560]   of what this whole issue was.
[01:17:01.560 --> 01:17:02.560]   Well, listen.
[01:17:02.560 --> 01:17:05.160]   So yes, I agree with you.
[01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:11.160]   And this is, I think like the last story, throwing the baby out with the bathwater, but this is,
[01:17:11.160 --> 01:17:12.160]   here's a success story.
[01:17:12.160 --> 01:17:14.760]   Washington County Sheriff's Office, they're just outside of Portland, Oregon.
[01:17:14.760 --> 01:17:17.240]   They set up the system for about 400 bucks.
[01:17:17.240 --> 01:17:21.160]   It costs them a few hundred, a few dollars a month to run.
[01:17:21.160 --> 01:17:26.480]   One of the first things they did is they fed the recognition system about 300,000 images
[01:17:26.480 --> 01:17:29.400]   from the county's mugshot database.
[01:17:29.400 --> 01:17:32.800]   Within a week going live, according to the times, the system was used to identify and
[01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:37.000]   arrest a suspect who stole more than $5,000 from local stores.
[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:43.920]   There were no leads before the system identified them, but it could also be used to spot troublemakers.
[01:17:43.920 --> 01:17:50.160]   In fact, apparently I didn't know this, but arenas do this at concerts.
[01:17:50.160 --> 01:17:53.640]   Arenas are using it to screen for troublemakers at events.
[01:17:53.640 --> 01:17:57.400]   The Department of Homeland Security used it to identify foreign visitors who overstay their
[01:17:57.400 --> 01:17:59.720]   visas.
[01:17:59.720 --> 01:18:04.880]   Madison Square Garden has used face scanning technology on customers.
[01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:07.560]   That's what that camera is on the mental detector.
[01:18:07.560 --> 01:18:12.400]   When you arrive, they're going to see you in that database and say, "Oh, yeah, we had
[01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:13.480]   to throw him out last year.
[01:18:13.480 --> 01:18:15.200]   I don't know if I have a problem with that.
[01:18:15.200 --> 01:18:16.960]   Do you have a problem with that?"
[01:18:16.960 --> 01:18:19.800]   I'll bet the casino is using it.
[01:18:19.800 --> 01:18:25.840]   Now, there are some issues, for instance, and the time it talks about this, these recognition
[01:18:25.840 --> 01:18:30.480]   systems have notorious problems with people of color.
[01:18:30.480 --> 01:18:37.320]   An MIT study showed that the gender of darker skin women was misidentified 35 percent of
[01:18:37.320 --> 01:18:40.760]   the time by face recognition software.
[01:18:40.760 --> 01:18:48.640]   The issue would be, in this case, I think the concern would be false positives.
[01:18:48.640 --> 01:18:51.520]   That's something to be very aware of.
[01:18:51.520 --> 01:18:57.880]   I think this is a potentially good technology that could be absolutely misused, and so there
[01:18:57.880 --> 01:18:59.480]   needs to be a lot of oversight.
[01:18:59.480 --> 01:19:02.160]   You don't regulate technology, you regulate the use.
[01:19:02.160 --> 01:19:03.160]   Law enforcement, yeah.
[01:19:03.160 --> 01:19:04.160]   Always say.
[01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:09.240]   I spoke to you last week when I was in Toronto for RightsCon, which is now my favorite conference.
[01:19:09.240 --> 01:19:15.200]   Which I found out they had in Canada because nobody could get into the United States.
[01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:16.200]   Exactly.
[01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:18.680]   Then, Canada blocked a lot of attendees.
[01:19:18.680 --> 01:19:20.320]   I didn't know that.
[01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:21.320]   Yes.
[01:19:21.320 --> 01:19:23.480]   Next year, it's in Tunis.
[01:19:23.480 --> 01:19:25.440]   I don't know where it's going to be.
[01:19:25.440 --> 01:19:26.440]   Maybe.
[01:19:26.440 --> 01:19:27.440]   Maybe.
[01:19:27.440 --> 01:19:28.440]   Literally.
[01:19:28.440 --> 01:19:29.440]   Literally.
[01:19:29.440 --> 01:19:30.440]   Next year, it's in Tunis.
[01:19:30.440 --> 01:19:31.440]   Oh, that's why.
[01:19:31.440 --> 01:19:34.120]   So, my grand conclusion out of this was I realized that everything people are screaming, almost
[01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:38.120]   everything people are screaming for Facebook to do, has nothing to do with technology,
[01:19:38.120 --> 01:19:41.280]   and has everything to do with human behavior.
[01:19:41.280 --> 01:19:44.520]   And government, where do you regulate human behavior?
[01:19:44.520 --> 01:19:48.640]   You regulate human behavior through government, or you regulate our norms, through families,
[01:19:48.640 --> 01:19:50.400]   and churches, and schools.
[01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:55.560]   What have we ever said to companies, fix society, change human behavior?
[01:19:55.560 --> 01:19:57.040]   We don't.
[01:19:57.040 --> 01:20:04.280]   But now, the alleged problem is of such a scale that nobody can figure it out.
[01:20:04.280 --> 01:20:05.280]   Government can't figure it out.
[01:20:05.280 --> 01:20:06.280]   Government doesn't know how to do its job.
[01:20:06.280 --> 01:20:11.600]   So, government outsources this and tells Facebook, solve it without defining the problem, witness
[01:20:11.600 --> 01:20:13.640]   the previous discussion.
[01:20:13.640 --> 01:20:20.280]   And so, the entire discussion of RightsCon was what's called intermediary liability.
[01:20:20.280 --> 01:20:27.360]   The intermediaries, the platforms, the phone companies, even the domain registrars, have
[01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:31.960]   government coming after them saying, "You get them to stop that."
[01:20:31.960 --> 01:20:35.960]   And it's really an aggregation of government's job.
[01:20:35.960 --> 01:20:40.520]   If government wants to regulate human behavior, that's their job, not the companies.
[01:20:40.520 --> 01:20:42.880]   But this is where we're starting to go to Facebook.
[01:20:42.880 --> 01:20:48.480]   Could government go to Facebook and say, "Hey, remove the like button from everybody's
[01:20:48.480 --> 01:20:50.880]   post, just flat out remove it.
[01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:53.360]   Only leave a comment field."
[01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:58.880]   And we're going to use that as a way to help clean up and make our society a little bit
[01:20:58.880 --> 01:21:02.480]   better, because there's so much power in that like.
[01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:04.000]   Can government do that to Facebook?
[01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.680]   No, that would be a violation of free speech.
[01:21:06.680 --> 01:21:11.280]   But government can say to Facebook, as well, government in Germany, government says to
[01:21:11.280 --> 01:21:16.280]   Facebook, "If someone uses hate speech or mentions Nazis or such, if you don't get
[01:21:16.280 --> 01:21:20.880]   rid of it within 24 hours, we will find you $500 million."
[01:21:20.880 --> 01:21:27.840]   So, you have the New York Times had a feature, I think it's on the rundown, from the content
[01:21:27.840 --> 01:21:33.520]   killing factory that's in Germany now, where people are there and they're having to look
[01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:40.440]   at horrid stuff to get rid of it, because the government is telling them, "Get rid of that
[01:21:40.440 --> 01:21:41.960]   piece of content and that piece of content."
[01:21:41.960 --> 01:21:45.280]   And if you don't, if you don't make this judgment, we're going to come after you big
[01:21:45.280 --> 01:21:46.280]   time.
[01:21:46.280 --> 01:21:48.440]   So, basically, they get rid of hood stuff.
[01:21:48.440 --> 01:21:51.160]   So, I'm not sure that's really good either.
[01:21:51.160 --> 01:21:53.000]   I don't think it is.
[01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:54.800]   I don't know what the answer is.
[01:21:54.800 --> 01:21:57.000]   I think that's the problem.
[01:21:57.000 --> 01:22:02.440]   Jeff, related to what you're just talking about, the whole regulation of behavior, look
[01:22:02.440 --> 01:22:04.680]   at what's going on in China with technology.
[01:22:04.680 --> 01:22:08.440]   They are regulating behavior with the technology now.
[01:22:08.440 --> 01:22:13.080]   And that's where I get scared with this technology, it being misused or used in a way that I
[01:22:13.080 --> 01:22:15.080]   don't want to have them.
[01:22:15.080 --> 01:22:16.080]   Precisely, Kevin.
[01:22:16.080 --> 01:22:21.520]   And when you open up a function for one's allegedly good government, that same function
[01:22:21.520 --> 01:22:23.080]   is then available to all governments.
[01:22:23.080 --> 01:22:29.720]   So, your point, Ann, is if one government demands the ability to change functions on
[01:22:29.720 --> 01:22:32.080]   Facebook, then every government can use that.
[01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:34.840]   And you can use that in Turkey and Russia and China.
[01:22:34.840 --> 01:22:37.280]   But I take your larger point.
[01:22:37.280 --> 01:22:40.080]   You think they like Button as Ruin Society?
[01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:42.920]   I think the like button is totally screwing stuff up.
[01:22:42.920 --> 01:22:46.840]   Especially in the younger generation.
[01:22:46.840 --> 01:22:55.320]   Because people, I just look at teenagers in particular and post something within five
[01:22:55.320 --> 01:22:59.840]   minutes, they're going back to their post to see how many likes they have.
[01:22:59.840 --> 01:23:04.560]   Let alone the fact that they got a house on fire behind them or something like that.
[01:23:04.560 --> 01:23:08.200]   They're worried about how many likes do I have on this particular post?
[01:23:08.200 --> 01:23:09.200]   Yeah, but you can.
[01:23:09.200 --> 01:23:10.400]   And Facebook fixed that.
[01:23:10.400 --> 01:23:12.400]   I mean, that's a societal problem.
[01:23:12.400 --> 01:23:14.200]   Why is the societal thing?
[01:23:14.200 --> 01:23:16.600]   We went to a concert on Friday.
[01:23:16.600 --> 01:23:18.760]   And we were pretty close to the front.
[01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:21.520]   And there was a young woman whose father had brought her was cute.
[01:23:21.520 --> 01:23:24.440]   And they were so proud of the fact that they were in the front row there.
[01:23:24.440 --> 01:23:30.480]   The entire concert, she's got her phone up and is videoing the concert.
[01:23:30.480 --> 01:23:34.280]   The entire concert, block him, my view, by the way, incidentally.
[01:23:34.280 --> 01:23:38.440]   And then, you know, in the middle of songs, the singer's on the stage, she's singing.
[01:23:38.440 --> 01:23:39.440]   She's right there.
[01:23:39.440 --> 01:23:41.680]   They're turning around and doing selfies.
[01:23:41.680 --> 01:23:44.640]   And what I finally realized is, you know, nobody's going to look at that video later.
[01:23:44.640 --> 01:23:49.200]   The point of that video, the point of the selfies is to post that on social networks,
[01:23:49.200 --> 01:23:51.440]   see how great my life is.
[01:23:51.440 --> 01:23:52.440]   Yeah.
[01:23:52.440 --> 01:23:58.400]   And it really made me sad that all of this was being viewed through this young person's
[01:23:58.400 --> 01:24:01.960]   desire to show off on social media.
[01:24:01.960 --> 01:24:03.400]   And she wasn't enjoying the concert.
[01:24:03.400 --> 01:24:05.120]   She wasn't paying attention to the concert.
[01:24:05.120 --> 01:24:07.840]   It was all about here I am at the concert.
[01:24:07.840 --> 01:24:09.200]   Look at me.
[01:24:09.200 --> 01:24:10.200]   And that's sad to me.
[01:24:10.200 --> 01:24:11.640]   I just felt bad for her.
[01:24:11.640 --> 01:24:12.640]   And don't get me wrong.
[01:24:12.640 --> 01:24:19.320]   There's a certain aspect of social life, of knowing where your friends and family are
[01:24:19.320 --> 01:24:21.320]   and celebrating it.
[01:24:21.320 --> 01:24:22.480]   But I think it's just, I agree.
[01:24:22.480 --> 01:24:23.480]   But a lot of it is.
[01:24:23.480 --> 01:24:25.520]   I think it's just gotten too big for that, man.
[01:24:25.520 --> 01:24:26.520]   Aren't I?
[01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:27.520]   Look how great my life is.
[01:24:27.520 --> 01:24:28.520]   Yeah.
[01:24:28.520 --> 01:24:32.520]   You know, yeah, the real problem with that is the other kids who think, well, mine's
[01:24:32.520 --> 01:24:33.520]   not right.
[01:24:33.520 --> 01:24:34.520]   Right.
[01:24:34.520 --> 01:24:35.520]   It's all a race.
[01:24:35.520 --> 01:24:40.840]   It's all a race to cultivate, to polish your image so that you look better than everybody
[01:24:40.840 --> 01:24:41.840]   else.
[01:24:41.840 --> 01:24:47.680]   But I don't think, admittedly, I mean, I often rag on Facebook and Twitter because they've
[01:24:47.680 --> 01:24:49.640]   become tools for a lot of bad things.
[01:24:49.640 --> 01:24:50.920]   But it's not really their fault.
[01:24:50.920 --> 01:24:52.800]   They're just the tools that the bad thing go.
[01:24:52.800 --> 01:24:54.640]   Can we put this in the history book?
[01:24:54.640 --> 01:24:56.320]   The bad things come from people.
[01:24:56.320 --> 01:24:57.320]   It's not their fault.
[01:24:57.320 --> 01:24:58.320]   Exactly.
[01:24:58.320 --> 01:24:59.320]   Yeah.
[01:24:59.320 --> 01:25:03.000]   And so what makes us think that these platforms, a part of the presumption is, well, they made
[01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:04.000]   us do it.
[01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:08.320]   No, the technology didn't make us empowered it.
[01:25:08.320 --> 01:25:13.800]   For a certain relatively small number of actors who were doing the worst things, right?
[01:25:13.800 --> 01:25:19.160]   The haters, the misogynists, the races, the fraudsters, the propagandists, the trolls.
[01:25:19.160 --> 01:25:20.760]   That's a relatively small number.
[01:25:20.760 --> 01:25:22.920]   Here's to the, what is it?
[01:25:22.920 --> 01:25:24.720]   The brilliant ones.
[01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:25.720]   Yeah.
[01:25:25.720 --> 01:25:28.560]   It sounded like a dystopian apple ad.
[01:25:28.560 --> 01:25:30.960]   Here's to the trolls, the haters.
[01:25:30.960 --> 01:25:32.960]   Not the misogynists, the misogynists.
[01:25:32.960 --> 01:25:33.960]   I'm going to do that.
[01:25:33.960 --> 01:25:36.400]   I'm going to make one of those.
[01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:37.400]   That's good.
[01:25:37.400 --> 01:25:38.400]   Yeah.
[01:25:38.400 --> 01:25:41.120]   Think different.
[01:25:41.120 --> 01:25:42.400]   So what do we do about it though?
[01:25:42.400 --> 01:25:46.200]   That's what that really, I fundamentally think that that's what all of these conversations
[01:25:46.200 --> 01:25:47.200]   come down to.
[01:25:47.200 --> 01:25:49.560]   Yes, we acknowledge we see this problem.
[01:25:49.560 --> 01:25:50.560]   What do we do?
[01:25:50.560 --> 01:25:53.600]   And I think we have to learn to ignore it.
[01:25:53.600 --> 01:25:57.240]   I've really, really come in to believe that the important thing is to pay attention to
[01:25:57.240 --> 01:25:58.240]   quality again.
[01:25:58.240 --> 01:26:05.440]   You know, I talked about how 20,000 people on Facebook are there to kill SHIT, 30,000
[01:26:05.440 --> 01:26:06.960]   journalists in American newspapers.
[01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:10.600]   What's wrong with that allocation of resources, no matter where it comes from?
[01:26:10.600 --> 01:26:16.680]   And we've got to just recognize what we're doing is we're giving the bad guys exactly
[01:26:16.680 --> 01:26:17.680]   what they want.
[01:26:17.680 --> 01:26:21.760]   Every time we have joined Donovan on from data and society, you know, there's a big report,
[01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:24.560]   I think I put it on the rundown.
[01:26:24.560 --> 01:26:31.640]   Trying to educate media about not giving the bad guys the attention that they crave, they're
[01:26:31.640 --> 01:26:33.840]   manipulating us in a return.
[01:26:33.840 --> 01:26:40.440]   The more it's the one lesson of the whole Internet age, don't feed the F in trolls.
[01:26:40.440 --> 01:26:41.440]   Yeah.
[01:26:41.440 --> 01:26:44.880]   And we're feeding them with this attention.
[01:26:44.880 --> 01:26:47.720]   Okay.
[01:26:47.720 --> 01:26:49.600]   But they don't go away because of that.
[01:26:49.600 --> 01:26:51.200]   Well, in a sense, they do.
[01:26:51.200 --> 01:26:56.120]   I mean, in a sense, I mean, I don't see them in my Facebook feed.
[01:26:56.120 --> 01:26:57.120]   Right.
[01:26:57.120 --> 01:26:58.120]   I don't.
[01:26:58.120 --> 01:26:59.120]   Right.
[01:26:59.120 --> 01:27:00.120]   Because I killed Facebook.
[01:27:00.120 --> 01:27:01.880]   Well, actually, I went back.
[01:27:01.880 --> 01:27:04.120]   I had to go back because I missed the tech TV reunion.
[01:27:04.120 --> 01:27:09.200]   I almost missed it because the only way they told people about it was on Facebook.
[01:27:09.200 --> 01:27:11.200]   Ah, gotcha.
[01:27:11.200 --> 01:27:12.200]   Yeah.
[01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:18.880]   Well, I'm not happy about it because I have to say I could, you know, as always, when
[01:27:18.880 --> 01:27:22.440]   you stop using a drug and you go back to it, you can really see the deleterious effect
[01:27:22.440 --> 01:27:24.400]   of it.
[01:27:24.400 --> 01:27:30.880]   But what are you going to do?
[01:27:30.880 --> 01:27:35.240]   I think all of that stuff can start with the individuals.
[01:27:35.240 --> 01:27:36.920]   So it starts with us.
[01:27:36.920 --> 01:27:37.920]   It's ignoring.
[01:27:37.920 --> 01:27:39.560]   So ignoring, I turn off comments.
[01:27:39.560 --> 01:27:43.400]   We don't use comments on our pages because we got rolled so much.
[01:27:43.400 --> 01:27:45.400]   So is that okay?
[01:27:45.400 --> 01:27:49.200]   Is that what you mean?
[01:27:49.200 --> 01:27:50.200]   Good question.
[01:27:50.200 --> 01:27:51.720]   Is that how you're letting people?
[01:27:51.720 --> 01:27:56.640]   Well, it's unfortunate, but at some point, if you're not going to have the, it would
[01:27:56.640 --> 01:28:04.920]   take the resources to deal with the comments and dealing with them is feeding them.
[01:28:04.920 --> 01:28:05.920]   That's what I'm saying.
[01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:06.920]   It's not worth it.
[01:28:06.920 --> 01:28:07.920]   Yeah.
[01:28:07.920 --> 01:28:09.920]   I mean, that's negative.
[01:28:09.920 --> 01:28:10.920]   That's negative.
[01:28:10.920 --> 01:28:12.480]   That's feedback too.
[01:28:12.480 --> 01:28:13.480]   That's attention.
[01:28:13.480 --> 01:28:14.480]   That's energy.
[01:28:14.480 --> 01:28:15.960]   If you, if you, they won, they killed it.
[01:28:15.960 --> 01:28:16.960]   Yeah.
[01:28:16.960 --> 01:28:21.400]   But also, I'm, I think that's an unsatisfactory answer.
[01:28:21.400 --> 01:28:25.160]   I mean, I know, I know, I know I have a better one, but it's an unsatisfactory answer because
[01:28:25.160 --> 01:28:29.040]   it's like saying, well, if people are burning your house down, just ignore them.
[01:28:29.040 --> 01:28:31.560]   But they're still burning the house down.
[01:28:31.560 --> 01:28:32.880]   Well, it's the problem.
[01:28:32.880 --> 01:28:38.320]   So Twitter lets you block people and unless you mute people and they're still, I find
[01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:40.160]   that unsatisfactory, I agree.
[01:28:40.160 --> 01:28:45.720]   But it's the tools we have at the ready and, and the other opportunity is to answer them.
[01:28:45.720 --> 01:28:47.480]   And that's the thing we have given up.
[01:28:47.480 --> 01:28:49.040]   Yeah, that doesn't work too well either.
[01:28:49.040 --> 01:28:50.040]   No, because it doesn't.
[01:28:50.040 --> 01:28:51.040]   And it should.
[01:28:51.040 --> 01:28:54.640]   We should have the right to say, to be in a jerk.
[01:28:54.640 --> 01:29:01.560]   Twitter finally, Twitter's getting a lot of heat for updating their API and screwing third-party
[01:29:01.560 --> 01:29:03.360]   apps yet again.
[01:29:03.360 --> 01:29:05.000]   As usual.
[01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:06.000]   It's business.
[01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.520]   It's a platform.
[01:29:08.520 --> 01:29:09.520]   Yeah.
[01:29:09.520 --> 01:29:13.520]   It's a platform that's going to be determined that nobody makes any money but Twitter.
[01:29:13.520 --> 01:29:18.400]   So there really isn't, it is clear that their goal is that you use Twitter's website and,
[01:29:18.400 --> 01:29:22.400]   and apps to access Twitter.
[01:29:22.400 --> 01:29:24.400]   Right?
[01:29:24.400 --> 01:29:27.120]   I mean.
[01:29:27.120 --> 01:29:34.320]   I look at most that one app that I used to love using, I think it was called Phoenix.
[01:29:34.320 --> 01:29:38.360]   Twitter app and ended up having to uninstall it.
[01:29:38.360 --> 01:29:40.800]   And when I went back to try to reinstall it later.
[01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:41.800]   Yeah.
[01:29:41.800 --> 01:29:42.800]   Could music.
[01:29:42.800 --> 01:29:43.800]   Yeah.
[01:29:43.800 --> 01:29:44.800]   Yeah.
[01:29:44.800 --> 01:29:48.400]   And it's because Twitter was like, yeah, we're only going to play just nice enough with
[01:29:48.400 --> 01:29:49.400]   these guys.
[01:29:49.400 --> 01:29:51.000]   Sorry, you missed the boat.
[01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:55.720]   You know, and Twitter has every right to do that, but it's still, I don't think it's
[01:29:55.720 --> 01:29:56.720]   selling it.
[01:29:56.720 --> 01:30:02.120]   Here's the, here's the icon factory developers tweeting the public pricing.
[01:30:02.120 --> 01:30:05.800]   I'm seeing shows Twitter's account activity API pricing because you have to pay to get
[01:30:05.800 --> 01:30:08.160]   the activity API.
[01:30:08.160 --> 01:30:13.640]   $2,899 a month for 250 users.
[01:30:13.640 --> 01:30:20.120]   That, you know, that's $10 a user a month to get push notifications on a platform where
[01:30:20.120 --> 01:30:23.520]   people's bulk and spending 99 cents is Greg Hockenberry.
[01:30:23.520 --> 01:30:27.280]   So this is going to be an issue.
[01:30:27.280 --> 01:30:30.120]   Fave star has shut down.
[01:30:30.120 --> 01:30:31.120]   Cloud shut down.
[01:30:31.120 --> 01:30:33.720]   Maybe cloud, I thought cloud might have shut down because of GDPR, but maybe it's because
[01:30:33.720 --> 01:30:37.960]   of this too, because they, they won't be able to get that info from Twitter.
[01:30:37.960 --> 01:30:40.240]   How many emails since you brought it up?
[01:30:40.240 --> 01:30:42.560]   How many damn emails are you getting right now?
[01:30:42.560 --> 01:30:43.560]   Oh, not stop.
[01:30:43.560 --> 01:30:44.560]   It's great.
[01:30:44.560 --> 01:30:45.560]   F NPR.
[01:30:45.560 --> 01:30:50.080]   I thought this was the, you're up.
[01:30:50.080 --> 01:30:51.080]   It's worse than CES.
[01:30:51.080 --> 01:30:55.880]   On the other hand, I think there's a very good answer.
[01:30:55.880 --> 01:30:56.880]   Are you dead?
[01:30:56.880 --> 01:30:57.880]   It is very similar.
[01:30:57.880 --> 01:30:58.880]   Isn't it?
[01:30:58.880 --> 01:30:59.880]   Are you dead against GDPR?
[01:30:59.880 --> 01:31:01.120]   Jeff, I know dead against.
[01:31:01.120 --> 01:31:02.760]   No, I think it's a badly done law.
[01:31:02.760 --> 01:31:03.760]   Dead against.
[01:31:03.760 --> 01:31:05.120]   No, we'll see how the answer meant it.
[01:31:05.120 --> 01:31:06.120]   Right.
[01:31:06.120 --> 01:31:07.120]   It could.
[01:31:07.120 --> 01:31:08.120]   Well, that's the problem.
[01:31:08.120 --> 01:31:09.120]   And it's very difficult.
[01:31:09.120 --> 01:31:15.000]   I have put on the rundown one, I think TV station somewhere in the US.
[01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:18.560]   Somebody from Oxford went in to try to just find some story that was going on.
[01:31:18.560 --> 01:31:20.880]   So sorry, you're from the EU.
[01:31:20.880 --> 01:31:26.080]   We're blocking you because we don't want to take any chances and it would take me 4%
[01:31:26.080 --> 01:31:28.080]   of our revenue and we're not doing it.
[01:31:28.080 --> 01:31:32.160]   So sorry until we get to this straight out, you ain't coming here.
[01:31:32.160 --> 01:31:35.240]   I think that's a good strategy.
[01:31:35.240 --> 01:31:36.880]   It's an unintended consequence, isn't it?
[01:31:36.880 --> 01:31:37.880]   Yeah, it is.
[01:31:37.880 --> 01:31:39.880]   I mean, everybody did that.
[01:31:39.880 --> 01:31:45.360]   That would be that it's kind of be the death now for GDPR.
[01:31:45.360 --> 01:31:47.480]   It's in the rundown somewhere.
[01:31:47.480 --> 01:31:55.640]   Like WordPress and Squarespace, they're probably going to make out OK on this because individuals
[01:31:55.640 --> 01:31:58.280]   that are trying to run their own websites and whatnot.
[01:31:58.280 --> 01:31:59.880]   It's a whole lot of.
[01:31:59.880 --> 01:32:02.280]   Yeah, that's a good point.
[01:32:02.280 --> 01:32:03.560]   Yeah, that's a very good point.
[01:32:03.560 --> 01:32:08.520]   If you rely on these companies to do the work, you don't have to.
[01:32:08.520 --> 01:32:10.000]   That's a very good point.
[01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:13.120]   All these laws that are aimed at making the big platforms less powerful make them more
[01:32:13.120 --> 01:32:14.120]   powerful, right?
[01:32:14.120 --> 01:32:15.120]   To be forgotten makes cool.
[01:32:15.120 --> 01:32:17.120]   That's a very good thing.
[01:32:17.120 --> 01:32:20.160]   GDPR is going to make Google and Twitter and Facebook more powerful.
[01:32:20.160 --> 01:32:21.480]   Why is that interesting?
[01:32:21.480 --> 01:32:24.280]   Anything about it that way.
[01:32:24.280 --> 01:32:25.280]   That is a very good point.
[01:32:25.280 --> 01:32:26.280]   This is what you said, Ant.
[01:32:26.280 --> 01:32:27.800]   He is a small business owner.
[01:32:27.800 --> 01:32:29.000]   You just can't do it.
[01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:30.000]   Right.
[01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:31.560]   They do have the resources to do it.
[01:32:31.560 --> 01:32:32.560]   They'll manage it.
[01:32:32.560 --> 01:32:37.640]   It's kind of what Ben Thompson's been saying.
[01:32:37.640 --> 01:32:46.600]   This is mulling an extension to the copyright act to 144 years.
[01:32:46.600 --> 01:32:48.240]   We are getting older.
[01:32:48.240 --> 01:32:50.320]   We're living longer.
[01:32:50.320 --> 01:32:54.520]   It used to be called the Sonny Bono Copyright Act.
[01:32:54.520 --> 01:33:00.080]   I think now we call it the Mickey Mouse Copyright Act because it all comes down to the Mickey
[01:33:00.080 --> 01:33:01.240]   Mouse copyright.
[01:33:01.240 --> 01:33:02.240]   Mickey Mouse was created in.
[01:33:02.240 --> 01:33:03.240]   I got it.
[01:33:03.240 --> 01:33:04.240]   There's a great chart here.
[01:33:04.240 --> 01:33:05.240]   Let me see if I can find it.
[01:33:05.240 --> 01:33:11.560]   Mickey Mouse was created in 1923.
[01:33:11.560 --> 01:33:18.240]   The copyright law began to see the changes as Disney Corporation faced the deadline and
[01:33:18.240 --> 01:33:23.440]   they extended it each time.
[01:33:23.440 --> 01:33:30.600]   In the original Copyright Act in 1790, your copyright was for 28 years.
[01:33:30.600 --> 01:33:35.480]   We did a little bit later in 1831 to 42 years.
[01:33:35.480 --> 01:33:37.800]   Mickey Mouse was created in 1928.
[01:33:37.800 --> 01:33:41.760]   At that time, the copyright was for 55 years.
[01:33:41.760 --> 01:33:49.760]   Interestingly enough, 55 years after Mickey Mouse was created, or actually it was 51 years,
[01:33:49.760 --> 01:33:50.760]   just in time.
[01:33:50.760 --> 01:33:54.160]   A copyright was extended from 1984.
[01:33:54.160 --> 01:33:57.640]   His copyright was extended from 1984 to 2003.
[01:33:57.640 --> 01:34:02.560]   In 1998, it was extended to 2023.
[01:34:02.560 --> 01:34:08.400]   Right now, the Mickey Mouse Copyright runs out in 2023 already, just to be proactive,
[01:34:08.400 --> 01:34:12.560]   to get on top of it, Congress is looking at extending it out.
[01:34:12.560 --> 01:34:18.160]   It's now currently 103 years, something 105 years to 140 years.
[01:34:18.160 --> 01:34:20.080]   It's ridiculous.
[01:34:20.080 --> 01:34:24.720]   It's all because it's Disney not wanting to lose the copyright to Mickey Mouse.
[01:34:24.720 --> 01:34:28.000]   Lawrence Lusick has tried to...
[01:34:28.000 --> 01:34:29.000]   Oh, yeah.
[01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:30.000]   Larry hates it.
[01:34:30.000 --> 01:34:31.000]   He tried to change everything.
[01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:32.000]   He finally gave...
[01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:33.000]   It was interesting.
[01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:40.760]   Lusick, who's a constitutional lawyer, he's at Harvard, and a great man, Creative Commons.
[01:34:40.760 --> 01:34:41.960]   He's been on Twitter a number of times.
[01:34:41.960 --> 01:34:44.800]   He was on Twitter a lot in the early days.
[01:34:44.800 --> 01:34:46.640]   Larry eventually gave up.
[01:34:46.640 --> 01:34:53.460]   He was trying to fix this and eventually realized, "I can't fix this as long as campaign finance
[01:34:53.460 --> 01:34:58.140]   laws are as they are," because ultimately, the votes go to the guy with the biggest,
[01:34:58.140 --> 01:34:59.900]   deepest pockets.
[01:34:59.900 --> 01:35:02.660]   He's changed his tack.
[01:35:02.660 --> 01:35:04.460]   He tried to do this in the last election.
[01:35:04.460 --> 01:35:12.900]   He ran for president to change campaign finance to reform this.
[01:35:12.900 --> 01:35:15.180]   His plan was, "Let me president."
[01:35:15.180 --> 01:35:18.580]   Since no incumbent will change, will reform campaign finance.
[01:35:18.580 --> 01:35:21.900]   Let me president, I will reform campaign finance.
[01:35:21.900 --> 01:35:26.020]   I'll pick a really good vice president and then resign.
[01:35:26.020 --> 01:35:27.020]   Let that person run it.
[01:35:27.020 --> 01:35:28.860]   I don't want the job, he's saying.
[01:35:28.860 --> 01:35:33.260]   I just want to be the guy who fixes campaign finance.
[01:35:33.260 --> 01:35:35.220]   Takes the big money out of politics.
[01:35:35.220 --> 01:35:37.740]   Unfortunately, he didn't even have a chance.
[01:35:37.740 --> 01:35:39.940]   I don't think he made it to the debates.
[01:35:39.940 --> 01:35:40.940]   No, you're not.
[01:35:40.940 --> 01:35:43.860]   Speaking of politics, you see who's working for Netflix?
[01:35:43.860 --> 01:35:44.860]   Oh.
[01:35:44.860 --> 01:35:47.060]   Michelle in Barack Obama?
[01:35:47.060 --> 01:35:48.060]   Oh.
[01:35:48.060 --> 01:35:52.620]   Signed a deal to produce programming for Netflix.
[01:35:52.620 --> 01:35:56.860]   It's lots and lots of hate and boycott.
[01:35:56.860 --> 01:35:57.860]   Really?
[01:35:57.860 --> 01:35:58.860]   Really?
[01:35:58.860 --> 01:35:59.860]   Really?
[01:35:59.860 --> 01:36:00.860]   They're coming out of the woodwork.
[01:36:00.860 --> 01:36:01.860]   Oh, man.
[01:36:01.860 --> 01:36:03.860]   The woodwork is where they belong.
[01:36:03.860 --> 01:36:09.100]   I wonder how much the tweet media amplified it.
[01:36:09.100 --> 01:36:11.100]   Yeah, it might have just been 100 tweets.
[01:36:11.100 --> 01:36:12.860]   100 tweets looks like a lot.
[01:36:12.860 --> 01:36:13.860]   Yeah.
[01:36:13.860 --> 01:36:16.820]   Yeah, true.
[01:36:16.820 --> 01:36:24.580]   So they're going to do, I guess, I gather documentary programming.
[01:36:24.580 --> 01:36:25.580]   Obama's--
[01:36:25.580 --> 01:36:26.580]   And I say why not?
[01:36:26.580 --> 01:36:29.460]   Scripted series, unscripted series, docu-series, documentaries
[01:36:29.460 --> 01:36:30.460]   and features.
[01:36:30.460 --> 01:36:33.740]   What this release from Netflix tells me is no one knows what they're going to do, but
[01:36:33.740 --> 01:36:34.740]   we got them.
[01:36:34.740 --> 01:36:35.740]   They got their names.
[01:36:35.740 --> 01:36:36.740]   We got the name.
[01:36:36.740 --> 01:36:38.380]   We got them, and that's what matters.
[01:36:38.380 --> 01:36:40.580]   We got them.
[01:36:40.580 --> 01:36:41.580]   That's funny.
[01:36:41.580 --> 01:36:42.580]   That's funny.
[01:36:42.580 --> 01:36:45.700]   I think, you know, this is the new second act going to work for Facebook.
[01:36:45.700 --> 01:36:46.700]   I mean, Netflix.
[01:36:46.700 --> 01:36:48.700]   Well, that's the next one to work.
[01:36:48.700 --> 01:36:51.980]   I think when Trump's out of office, he'll go to work for Twitter.
[01:36:51.980 --> 01:36:52.980]   Twitter.
[01:36:52.980 --> 01:36:53.980]   He ought to.
[01:36:53.980 --> 01:36:54.980]   He could be.
[01:36:54.980 --> 01:36:55.980]   He ought to.
[01:36:55.980 --> 01:36:56.980]   He ought to.
[01:36:56.980 --> 01:36:59.580]   Who was one of the earliest-- what was his name?
[01:36:59.580 --> 01:37:00.580]   Which one was it?
[01:37:00.580 --> 01:37:02.060]   The earliest celebrities on Twitter who--
[01:37:02.060 --> 01:37:03.060]   Ash and Kutcher.
[01:37:03.060 --> 01:37:06.660]   Ash and Kutcher insisted the Twitter owed him a fortune because he made them.
[01:37:06.660 --> 01:37:07.660]   Yeah.
[01:37:07.660 --> 01:37:12.420]   I had somewhere-- Kevin Rose was on the new screen savers a couple of weeks ago.
[01:37:12.420 --> 01:37:16.340]   And in the early days of Twitter in 2007, Kevin and I were in a race.
[01:37:16.340 --> 01:37:20.860]   I was number one on Twitter with 30,000 followers.
[01:37:20.860 --> 01:37:22.460]   And he was slowly coming up.
[01:37:22.460 --> 01:37:23.740]   Number two, I was number one.
[01:37:23.740 --> 01:37:27.860]   Barack Obama was a candidate, but not president yet, was number two.
[01:37:27.860 --> 01:37:29.820]   Kevin Rose was number three.
[01:37:29.820 --> 01:37:33.660]   Eventually, Kevin Rose beat me and Barack.
[01:37:33.660 --> 01:37:37.300]   And I can call him Barack because of her Twitter buddies.
[01:37:37.300 --> 01:37:40.860]   But then none of it mattered because along comes Ash and Kutcher, and then that was all
[01:37:40.860 --> 01:37:41.860]   over.
[01:37:41.860 --> 01:37:45.300]   He was the first to a million, I think.
[01:37:45.300 --> 01:37:46.300]   Oops.
[01:37:46.300 --> 01:37:47.300]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:37:47.300 --> 01:37:52.140]   The city of Lake Worth, Florida sent out a zombie alert.
[01:37:52.140 --> 01:37:53.140]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:37:53.140 --> 01:37:54.140]   Florida, man.
[01:37:54.140 --> 01:37:55.140]   Florida, 10th man.
[01:37:55.140 --> 01:37:59.580]   About 145 in the morning on Sunday.
[01:37:59.580 --> 01:38:02.660]   Projected repair time, power outage and zombie alert for residents of Lake Worth and
[01:38:02.660 --> 01:38:03.660]   Terminus.
[01:38:03.660 --> 01:38:09.980]   They are now far less than 7,380 customers involved due to extreme zombie activity.
[01:38:09.980 --> 01:38:14.540]   Restoration time, uncertain.
[01:38:14.540 --> 01:38:18.260]   Terminus is a city in The Walking Dead.
[01:38:18.260 --> 01:38:21.860]   So it was intentional.
[01:38:21.860 --> 01:38:25.380]   The power was out for 27 minutes.
[01:38:25.380 --> 01:38:30.740]   And Ben Kerr, who is the city's public information officer, said, "I want to reiterate Lake Worth
[01:38:30.740 --> 01:38:33.500]   does not have any zombie activity currently."
[01:38:33.500 --> 01:38:38.340]   And I apologize for the system message.
[01:38:38.340 --> 01:38:40.060]   We're looking into it.
[01:38:40.060 --> 01:38:42.780]   I like how you put that qualifying in there currently.
[01:38:42.780 --> 01:38:43.780]   Currently.
[01:38:43.780 --> 01:38:45.460]   As far as we can tell.
[01:38:45.460 --> 01:38:47.460]   You got to be able to couch that ant.
[01:38:47.460 --> 01:38:48.820]   You don't want to be--
[01:38:48.820 --> 01:38:49.820]   Right.
[01:38:49.820 --> 01:38:50.820]   Allegedly.
[01:38:50.820 --> 01:38:51.820]   No, allegedly.
[01:38:51.820 --> 01:38:52.820]   Allegedly.
[01:38:52.820 --> 01:38:53.820]   It's good.
[01:38:53.820 --> 01:38:55.300]   Yeah, according to sources.
[01:38:55.300 --> 01:38:56.940]   All right, somebody stuck this in.
[01:38:56.940 --> 01:39:00.420]   I don't know who did.
[01:39:00.420 --> 01:39:02.500]   This is our video of the week.
[01:39:02.500 --> 01:39:04.460]   I did it on the weekends.
[01:39:04.460 --> 01:39:07.340]   It is the queen at the royal wedding.
[01:39:07.340 --> 01:39:09.340]   Sitting next to--
[01:39:09.340 --> 01:39:11.340]   She wore a green screen.
[01:39:11.340 --> 01:39:12.340]   Oh, she wore green.
[01:39:12.340 --> 01:39:14.340]   It was a green dress.
[01:39:14.340 --> 01:39:15.340]   Oh.
[01:39:15.340 --> 01:39:19.220]   Those of you who can only hear the green dress to be used with all these wonderful graphics
[01:39:19.220 --> 01:39:20.220]   behind.
[01:39:20.220 --> 01:39:21.220]   It's a light show.
[01:39:21.220 --> 01:39:22.220]   Great.
[01:39:22.220 --> 01:39:23.220]   I like you.
[01:39:23.220 --> 01:39:24.220]   I win.
[01:39:24.220 --> 01:39:25.220]   Isn't that great?
[01:39:25.220 --> 01:39:27.020]   I love that.
[01:39:27.020 --> 01:39:28.020]   I love that.
[01:39:28.020 --> 01:39:30.620]   The queen is so badass though.
[01:39:30.620 --> 01:39:31.620]   Why is it though?
[01:39:31.620 --> 01:39:32.620]   By the way, I just want to point this out.
[01:39:32.620 --> 01:39:34.700]   And I don't think it's anything I do.
[01:39:34.700 --> 01:39:38.220]   Every time I play a video on YouTube, I get recommendations.
[01:39:38.220 --> 01:39:41.580]   You can show this for bikini-rich content.
[01:39:41.580 --> 01:39:42.580]   Is it just me?
[01:39:42.580 --> 01:39:43.580]   Well, you--
[01:39:43.580 --> 01:39:44.580]   I think so.
[01:39:44.580 --> 01:39:47.580]   I just watched a video about the queen of England.
[01:39:47.580 --> 01:39:48.580]   The queen.
[01:39:48.580 --> 01:39:49.580]   All right.
[01:39:49.580 --> 01:39:53.860]   I'll be honest with you, Mr. LePorte.
[01:39:53.860 --> 01:39:57.580]   Well, I'm not signed in to my YouTube.
[01:39:57.580 --> 01:39:59.660]   And I actually just go there to browse something.
[01:39:59.660 --> 01:40:01.420]   It does the same thing to me.
[01:40:01.420 --> 01:40:03.060]   So it has nothing to do with anybody.
[01:40:03.060 --> 01:40:07.300]   It's just they just know the algorithm knows that's what people really want.
[01:40:07.300 --> 01:40:09.140]   That was a nice cover for a man.
[01:40:09.140 --> 01:40:11.140]   Thank you, Ann.
[01:40:11.140 --> 01:40:12.140]   Thank you, Ann.
[01:40:12.140 --> 01:40:14.220]   If I'm signed in, I don't get those recommendations.
[01:40:14.220 --> 01:40:19.980]   But I have noticed a lot of sports illustrated swimsuit issues popping up on my screen.
[01:40:19.980 --> 01:40:21.980]   Reminds me of the first podcast to Expo.
[01:40:21.980 --> 01:40:25.060]   I went to somebody came up to me and said, "I got a brilliant idea."
[01:40:25.060 --> 01:40:26.260]   You guys really got to get into this.
[01:40:26.260 --> 01:40:27.260]   I said what?
[01:40:27.260 --> 01:40:29.580]   He said, "Three words, bikini-rich content."
[01:40:29.580 --> 01:40:34.500]   So last six, yeah, man.
[01:40:34.500 --> 01:40:35.500]   Last six.
[01:40:35.500 --> 01:40:36.500]   All right.
[01:40:36.500 --> 01:40:37.940]   It's time to wrap this up.
[01:40:37.940 --> 01:40:40.780]   We've been going for a while.
[01:40:40.780 --> 01:40:43.220]   And I'm at the end of the rundown.
[01:40:43.220 --> 01:40:46.580]   Unless somebody has something they want to stick in here.
[01:40:46.580 --> 01:40:48.220]   No, we did Chromebooks.
[01:40:48.220 --> 01:40:50.220]   What more do you need more than we need?
[01:40:50.220 --> 01:40:52.220]   So what I'm going to do is we do this every week.
[01:40:52.220 --> 01:40:55.980]   We give you a chance to pick something or talk about something.
[01:40:55.980 --> 01:40:57.060]   Anybody, Ann, do you want to start it off?
[01:40:57.060 --> 01:40:59.060]   You got to pick of the week.
[01:40:59.060 --> 01:41:00.060]   Sure.
[01:41:00.060 --> 01:41:06.420]   Normally, I'll come over here and I'll plug my YouTube channel and stuff like that.
[01:41:06.420 --> 01:41:09.420]   But I want to plug Tech Republic, first of all.
[01:41:09.420 --> 01:41:19.220]   But secondly, some people may not realize that May is the mental awareness month.
[01:41:19.220 --> 01:41:24.220]   I just want to reach out to everybody here on the Twit network that's watching it and
[01:41:24.220 --> 01:41:31.460]   just say, hey, take some time and be aware of the mental awareness month.
[01:41:31.460 --> 01:41:35.660]   And if you know someone that's dealing with it and having issues with it, try to help
[01:41:35.660 --> 01:41:38.140]   them get some help.
[01:41:38.140 --> 01:41:40.740]   This is something very near and dear to my heart.
[01:41:40.740 --> 01:41:48.060]   And it's, you know, I have no problem going public with it and stating that Mrs. Pruitt,
[01:41:48.060 --> 01:41:52.860]   she suffers from major depressive disorder.
[01:41:52.860 --> 01:42:02.420]   And it's a battle at times, but she's strong and she's fighting and she does everything
[01:42:02.420 --> 01:42:04.420]   she can do.
[01:42:04.420 --> 01:42:06.620]   And she has your support to herself.
[01:42:06.620 --> 01:42:07.620]   Right.
[01:42:07.620 --> 01:42:12.860]   And she's been doing everything that she can this month to try to help raise awareness
[01:42:12.860 --> 01:42:13.900]   for this disease.
[01:42:13.900 --> 01:42:21.020]   So just take five seconds if you can and just just not don't brush this stuff off.
[01:42:21.020 --> 01:42:27.900]   You know, we just the other day there was a an accident here in my town and it ended
[01:42:27.900 --> 01:42:31.260]   up being because of a mental disorder.
[01:42:31.260 --> 01:42:38.020]   Gentlemen was having dinner with his family Sunday dinner with his family and the restaurant.
[01:42:38.020 --> 01:42:44.100]   He gets up and leaves from the table because he has anxiety issues and he gets in his vehicle
[01:42:44.100 --> 01:42:46.860]   and drives into the restaurant.
[01:42:46.860 --> 01:42:52.220]   Oh, and I heard a lot of people including killing his family.
[01:42:52.220 --> 01:42:54.180]   Oh my God.
[01:42:54.180 --> 01:42:57.060]   And it's because he has a mental disorder.
[01:42:57.060 --> 01:43:06.580]   So folks, please take a moment and just recognize the fact that mental disorders are real.
[01:43:06.580 --> 01:43:07.580]   And it's an illness.
[01:43:07.580 --> 01:43:08.580]   And it's an illness.
[01:43:08.580 --> 01:43:11.860]   And thank you for sharing that, Ant, because I think one of the things that happens is
[01:43:11.860 --> 01:43:18.060]   so stigmatized that people don't talk about it in their lives.
[01:43:18.060 --> 01:43:22.220]   And the truth is once people talk about it, everybody has an experience.
[01:43:22.220 --> 01:43:24.220]   You find out everybody has it exactly.
[01:43:24.220 --> 01:43:26.500]   There is some something.
[01:43:26.500 --> 01:43:29.300]   And have you you go to VidCon?
[01:43:29.300 --> 01:43:30.740]   Haven't been to VidCon yet.
[01:43:30.740 --> 01:43:33.140]   I I'm where do you live?
[01:43:33.140 --> 01:43:35.220]   I'm in Charlotte, North Carolina.
[01:43:35.220 --> 01:43:36.220]   Okay.
[01:43:36.220 --> 01:43:37.820]   Well, it's a little closer than I am in New York.
[01:43:37.820 --> 01:43:38.820]   I recommend it.
[01:43:38.820 --> 01:43:42.700]   I think it's an amazing conference, but the best thing that I ever do at VidCon every
[01:43:42.700 --> 01:43:49.740]   year, they have usually two mental health panels where youtubers who have bravely just
[01:43:49.740 --> 01:43:56.180]   as you did bravely talked on YouTube about their own or their loved ones, depression
[01:43:56.180 --> 01:44:01.020]   or anxiety or addiction or eating disorder.
[01:44:01.020 --> 01:44:04.820]   And they've already done that to the world on YouTube, but they're they're on stage with
[01:44:04.820 --> 01:44:10.140]   a therapist on stage Katie Martin, I think, right?
[01:44:10.140 --> 01:44:12.820]   I'm forgetting her name suddenly.
[01:44:12.820 --> 01:44:20.140]   And then in the room are 300 400 mainly young people, mostly young women who share that.
[01:44:20.140 --> 01:44:22.740]   And the empathy is incredible.
[01:44:22.740 --> 01:44:28.820]   And the value of sharing and being open and helping somebody else is just so apparent
[01:44:28.820 --> 01:44:29.980]   in that room.
[01:44:29.980 --> 01:44:31.420]   So thank you for bringing this up.
[01:44:31.420 --> 01:44:32.500]   You're absolutely right.
[01:44:32.500 --> 01:44:37.500]   We all know someone who needs that support and needs that help.
[01:44:37.500 --> 01:44:38.500]   Thank you.
[01:44:38.500 --> 01:44:39.500]   Here's stigma.org.
[01:44:39.500 --> 01:44:44.220]   If you, I mean, the stigma is the thing I think that really, really hurts because it's an
[01:44:44.220 --> 01:44:45.220]   illness.
[01:44:45.220 --> 01:44:46.220]   Because we don't talk about it.
[01:44:46.220 --> 01:44:47.220]   We don't talk about it.
[01:44:47.220 --> 01:44:49.500]   We treat it as something other than an illness.
[01:44:49.500 --> 01:44:55.740]   And, you know, if somebody sick, you get treatment, you get help, you know, people understand
[01:44:55.740 --> 01:44:56.740]   it.
[01:44:56.740 --> 01:45:00.780]   There's sympathy, but mental illness is often treated as something, some sort of moral
[01:45:00.780 --> 01:45:02.420]   deficiency and it's not.
[01:45:02.420 --> 01:45:05.020]   It's just a physical illness.
[01:45:05.020 --> 01:45:06.420]   It's chemical.
[01:45:06.420 --> 01:45:07.420]   It's chemical.
[01:45:07.420 --> 01:45:11.380]   And it's a physical illness like cancer or anything else.
[01:45:11.380 --> 01:45:13.300]   And there should not be a stigma.
[01:45:13.300 --> 01:45:19.660]   And I think if we get rid of this stigma, I think people can seek help and will not
[01:45:19.660 --> 01:45:22.500]   live in darkness.
[01:45:22.500 --> 01:45:25.820]   And yeah, boy, I'm glad you brought that up.
[01:45:25.820 --> 01:45:29.980]   Curestigma.org is a good place to start.
[01:45:29.980 --> 01:45:33.580]   Mr. Kevin Tofol, your selection of the week.
[01:45:33.580 --> 01:45:36.580]   Well, I can't follow that up with a lame crumb OS.
[01:45:36.580 --> 01:45:37.580]   Oh, sure you can.
[01:45:37.580 --> 01:45:38.580]   Web extension.
[01:45:38.580 --> 01:45:39.580]   Oh, sure you can.
[01:45:39.580 --> 01:45:40.580]   Actually, I can't.
[01:45:40.580 --> 01:45:41.580]   I can't.
[01:45:41.580 --> 01:45:43.220]   I'm going to say something and I'm not saying it as out of sympathy.
[01:45:43.220 --> 01:45:47.780]   I'm thrilled that Ant brought this up.
[01:45:47.780 --> 01:45:49.180]   Folks don't probably know this.
[01:45:49.180 --> 01:45:54.340]   I lost my father to suicide through depression in 2009.
[01:45:54.340 --> 01:45:58.740]   And I've actually been on depression medication since 2011.
[01:45:58.740 --> 01:46:00.140]   And it is a struggle every day.
[01:46:00.140 --> 01:46:01.780]   And again, I'm not saying this for sympathy.
[01:46:01.780 --> 01:46:04.620]   This is my fight and I fight it every day.
[01:46:04.620 --> 01:46:05.620]   And you're right.
[01:46:05.620 --> 01:46:07.340]   Leo, the stigma has to go away.
[01:46:07.340 --> 01:46:08.940]   This is an illness.
[01:46:08.940 --> 01:46:13.340]   And, you know, everybody's mind works differently and everybody has to deal with things in different
[01:46:13.340 --> 01:46:17.540]   ways and just be there for people, support people.
[01:46:17.540 --> 01:46:19.660]   Ant, thank you so much for bringing this up.
[01:46:19.660 --> 01:46:20.660]   I really appreciate it.
[01:46:20.660 --> 01:46:21.660]   It was perfect timing.
[01:46:21.660 --> 01:46:22.660]   Thank you, Kevin.
[01:46:22.660 --> 01:46:24.300]   That's generous to do.
[01:46:24.300 --> 01:46:25.820]   Well, it is what it is.
[01:46:25.820 --> 01:46:26.820]   It's reality, Jeff.
[01:46:26.820 --> 01:46:27.820]   I don't shy away.
[01:46:27.820 --> 01:46:29.540]   I never have shy away from reality.
[01:46:29.540 --> 01:46:32.040]   My writing, not on video.
[01:46:32.040 --> 01:46:35.780]   And it was just never an opportunity to say, "Hey, let me talk about this."
[01:46:35.780 --> 01:46:36.780]   So here it was.
[01:46:36.780 --> 01:46:37.780]   I took it.
[01:46:37.780 --> 01:46:38.780]   Good.
[01:46:38.780 --> 01:46:42.460]   And I hope people really do take it to heart, not just this month, but all the time.
[01:46:42.460 --> 01:46:43.460]   Yeah.
[01:46:43.460 --> 01:46:44.460]   Thank you.
[01:46:44.460 --> 01:46:45.460]   Great.
[01:46:45.460 --> 01:46:46.460]   Yeah.
[01:46:46.460 --> 01:46:48.220]   Jeff, you got a number?
[01:46:48.220 --> 01:46:52.660]   I have five depressed relatives.
[01:46:52.660 --> 01:46:55.060]   Oh, there you go.
[01:46:55.060 --> 01:46:56.820]   That's a good night.
[01:46:56.820 --> 01:47:04.940]   Yeah, let me first plug since we're on Disturbating Things, Data and Society, our friend Joan Donovan,
[01:47:04.940 --> 01:47:05.940]   who tweeted me.
[01:47:05.940 --> 01:47:07.780]   She loved last week's show.
[01:47:07.780 --> 01:47:14.340]   Data Society, which watches out for manipulation in media, has a new report out called The
[01:47:14.340 --> 01:47:23.420]   Oxygen of Amplification by Whitney Phillips, which is about how media spread these things.
[01:47:23.420 --> 01:47:31.220]   And there's a precedent for media watching what it says, which is suicide, that the norm
[01:47:31.220 --> 01:47:39.300]   in journalism is to report the fact, but not the means, because there are copycats,
[01:47:39.300 --> 01:47:43.580]   there are people who get inspired, and it doesn't accomplish anything.
[01:47:43.580 --> 01:47:47.580]   It's a lesson we haven't learned when it comes to mass killers, and it's a lesson we haven't
[01:47:47.580 --> 01:47:51.060]   learned when it comes to propaganda, manipulation, and trolls.
[01:47:51.060 --> 01:47:54.380]   Listen to an important report, and I recommend it.
[01:47:54.380 --> 01:48:00.020]   But then I'll give you a real number, which is that Starbucks, surprisingly, wins the
[01:48:00.020 --> 01:48:03.020]   mobile payment derby.
[01:48:03.020 --> 01:48:07.700]   More people are using Starbucks mobile payment than Apple Pay, Google Pay, or Samsung Pay.
[01:48:07.700 --> 01:48:08.700]   Guess why?
[01:48:08.700 --> 01:48:11.740]   Because Starbucks comes with caffeine.
[01:48:11.740 --> 01:48:17.060]   You know, the greatest legal addictive drug in history.
[01:48:17.060 --> 01:48:18.060]   Yep.
[01:48:18.060 --> 01:48:21.140]   Why didn't I think of that 20 years ago?
[01:48:21.140 --> 01:48:27.220]   I think I need to start up a third wave coffee shop here and put some mobile payments behind
[01:48:27.220 --> 01:48:30.420]   it, and I'm going to be a very rich man.
[01:48:30.420 --> 01:48:31.420]   Yeah.
[01:48:31.420 --> 01:48:32.420]   My recommendation.
[01:48:32.420 --> 01:48:33.420]   Bitcoin.
[01:48:33.420 --> 01:48:34.420]   Go ahead.
[01:48:34.420 --> 01:48:37.980]   No, I was just saying, "Ann, go Bitcoin."
[01:48:37.980 --> 01:48:38.980]   Really?
[01:48:38.980 --> 01:48:39.980]   Bitcoin.
[01:48:39.980 --> 01:48:40.980]   Yeah.
[01:48:40.980 --> 01:48:43.580]   You can use that Monster Machine behind you to mine a lot of the business.
[01:48:43.580 --> 01:48:44.580]   Yes, I can.
[01:48:44.580 --> 01:48:47.100]   The Bitcoin coffee shop.
[01:48:47.100 --> 01:48:48.780]   That's a good idea.
[01:48:48.780 --> 01:48:53.580]   I want to just put in a plug for something that we installed at Google I/O, a lot of
[01:48:53.580 --> 01:48:54.780]   us.
[01:48:54.780 --> 01:48:59.500]   And if you have been afraid, I just want to say, "Do it," and that's Android P.
[01:48:59.500 --> 01:49:00.500]   Yeah.
[01:49:00.500 --> 01:49:01.500]   It's...
[01:49:01.500 --> 01:49:04.660]   Now, not every phone can do it, but if you have one of the phones that can, it's really
[01:49:04.660 --> 01:49:06.820]   a large number, including the essential phone.
[01:49:06.820 --> 01:49:13.820]   Of course, the Pixel's the Nokia 7, the OnePlus 6, the Oppo, the Sony, Vivo, and Xiaomi.
[01:49:13.820 --> 01:49:15.380]   P is awesome, and it's ready.
[01:49:15.380 --> 01:49:18.140]   I mean, I have not had any problems with it.
[01:49:18.140 --> 01:49:19.620]   It works really beautifully.
[01:49:19.620 --> 01:49:21.180]   Yeah, a few minor bugs.
[01:49:21.180 --> 01:49:22.180]   Yeah.
[01:49:22.180 --> 01:49:23.180]   I mean, I had one hard real bad.
[01:49:23.180 --> 01:49:24.180]   It's a big show, real bad.
[01:49:24.180 --> 01:49:25.180]   It's a big show, real bad app, so that it did.
[01:49:25.180 --> 01:49:26.180]   Yes.
[01:49:26.180 --> 01:49:28.260]   When I click on some notifications, it doesn't really grow the notification.
[01:49:28.260 --> 01:49:29.500]   These are minor as can be.
[01:49:29.500 --> 01:49:32.660]   And the new UI, this slidey UI, is awesome.
[01:49:32.660 --> 01:49:33.660]   It's nice.
[01:49:33.660 --> 01:49:37.060]   I thought I was going to be sticking my tongue out, trying to figure out, "How do I do
[01:49:37.060 --> 01:49:38.060]   that?"
[01:49:38.060 --> 01:49:39.060]   But it's...
[01:49:39.060 --> 01:49:40.060]   It works.
[01:49:40.060 --> 01:49:41.060]   No.
[01:49:41.060 --> 01:49:43.660]   If you've been putting it off, I think it's a fair thing to do if your phone supports it.
[01:49:43.660 --> 01:49:47.140]   I'm using it on Pixel 2 XL, and I wouldn't even go back.
[01:49:47.140 --> 01:49:48.140]   It's just really nice.
[01:49:48.140 --> 01:49:49.860]   And you have a switched launchers again.
[01:49:49.860 --> 01:49:50.860]   You're sticking with the entire...
[01:49:50.860 --> 01:49:54.340]   I'm sticking with the Pixel launcher, which is an actual big statement, because I've been
[01:49:54.340 --> 01:49:55.340]   using it for a long time.
[01:49:55.340 --> 01:49:56.340]   That's a great launcher.
[01:49:56.340 --> 01:49:57.340]   Progress for Leo.
[01:49:57.340 --> 01:49:58.340]   Yeah.
[01:49:58.340 --> 01:49:59.340]   That's a good sign.
[01:49:59.340 --> 01:50:02.820]   Well, it just means, you know, quickly, can you quickly access the camera with the whole
[01:50:02.820 --> 01:50:04.020]   double click on the camera?
[01:50:04.020 --> 01:50:06.740]   Oh, that's a good question.
[01:50:06.740 --> 01:50:08.220]   That's important.
[01:50:08.220 --> 01:50:09.220]   Yeah.
[01:50:09.220 --> 01:50:10.700]   You could with the...
[01:50:10.700 --> 01:50:11.700]   Yes.
[01:50:11.700 --> 01:50:12.700]   You can.
[01:50:12.700 --> 01:50:13.700]   Well, I'll give it a run.
[01:50:13.700 --> 01:50:14.700]   So that's...
[01:50:14.700 --> 01:50:20.700]   I don't know if that's an Android feature as much as a Pixel feature, but that's a very
[01:50:20.700 --> 01:50:21.700]   nice feature.
[01:50:21.700 --> 01:50:22.700]   I agree.
[01:50:22.700 --> 01:50:23.700]   Yeah.
[01:50:23.700 --> 01:50:24.700]   You want to get right to the camera.
[01:50:24.700 --> 01:50:25.700]   Do you use a Pixel 2?
[01:50:25.700 --> 01:50:26.700]   I have a Pixel 2 XL, sir.
[01:50:26.700 --> 01:50:27.700]   Such a nice camera.
[01:50:27.700 --> 01:50:28.700]   Oh, love it.
[01:50:28.700 --> 01:50:31.100]   It makes me wonder why I bring other cameras with me.
[01:50:31.100 --> 01:50:32.100]   It's such a...
[01:50:32.100 --> 01:50:33.100]   It's...
[01:50:33.100 --> 01:50:35.260]   You know, I have to, but it's just...
[01:50:35.260 --> 01:50:38.420]   I feel like, "Wow, I could probably do this."
[01:50:38.420 --> 01:50:44.820]   I've done photos with it and have sold images that were shot with the Pixel.
[01:50:44.820 --> 01:50:49.740]   I even did a headshot session with the Pixel for a client.
[01:50:49.740 --> 01:50:50.740]   Wow.
[01:50:50.740 --> 01:50:52.460]   See, that's the real problem is a client's...
[01:50:52.460 --> 01:50:53.460]   Clients go, "What?
[01:50:53.460 --> 01:50:54.460]   You're not going to bring it up."
[01:50:54.460 --> 01:50:56.420]   Yeah, what did your client think of that?
[01:50:56.420 --> 01:50:57.980]   Oh, he loved it.
[01:50:57.980 --> 01:50:58.980]   Really?
[01:50:58.980 --> 01:50:59.980]   Really?
[01:50:59.980 --> 01:51:00.980]   I'm shocked.
[01:51:00.980 --> 01:51:04.300]   I come in there, I had my camera and I had my tripod and lights and all of that, and
[01:51:04.300 --> 01:51:06.900]   I snapped a few with the camera, but then I said, "You know what?
[01:51:06.900 --> 01:51:09.820]   I'm going to also use this camera to...
[01:51:09.820 --> 01:51:12.660]   I'm at this phone to do something with your shots as well."
[01:51:12.660 --> 01:51:13.660]   And I got a hunch.
[01:51:13.660 --> 01:51:15.220]   You're going to like these just as much.
[01:51:15.220 --> 01:51:16.700]   And he did.
[01:51:16.700 --> 01:51:17.700]   Oh.
[01:51:17.700 --> 01:51:22.020]   Sure enough, the one that's been published everywhere is from that Pixel.
[01:51:22.020 --> 01:51:23.020]   I...
[01:51:23.020 --> 01:51:26.860]   When we were in Japan a couple of weeks ago, I used the Pixel a lot.
[01:51:26.860 --> 01:51:29.260]   This is a photo sphere that I created with the Pixel.
[01:51:29.260 --> 01:51:33.020]   It's a very famous Japanese garden.
[01:51:33.020 --> 01:51:36.620]   But I have to say, I think the quality and the fact that I could do a photo sphere with
[01:51:36.620 --> 01:51:40.540]   it for one thing and the quality of it made this...
[01:51:40.540 --> 01:51:44.420]   The camera to use for this place.
[01:51:44.420 --> 01:51:46.660]   It was very easy to quickly shoot this photo sphere with it.
[01:51:46.660 --> 01:51:48.380]   You still carry your big camera?
[01:51:48.380 --> 01:51:49.940]   I did.
[01:51:49.940 --> 01:51:54.060]   I did, and I took a lot of pictures with it, but I find that many of the pictures I look
[01:51:54.060 --> 01:51:56.140]   at again and again came from the Pixel 2.
[01:51:56.140 --> 01:51:58.460]   Kevin, what are you carrying these days?
[01:51:58.460 --> 01:51:59.460]   It was funny you asked.
[01:51:59.460 --> 01:52:04.180]   I actually was just thinking back to the last time I carried a DSLR, which was probably
[01:52:04.180 --> 01:52:05.860]   CES a couple of years back.
[01:52:05.860 --> 01:52:11.900]   I just carry phones now and I do a wheel between iOS and Android, so I have an old Pixel XL
[01:52:11.900 --> 01:52:13.460]   and an iPhone X.
[01:52:13.460 --> 01:52:14.460]   Yeah.
[01:52:14.460 --> 01:52:18.220]   I had to go on to iPhone pictures as well, but I have to say that just as...
[01:52:18.220 --> 01:52:21.420]   I'm slightly in favor of the Pixel 2 of the 2.
[01:52:21.420 --> 01:52:22.420]   Yeah.
[01:52:22.420 --> 01:52:23.420]   It's a great camera.
[01:52:23.420 --> 01:52:24.420]   Yeah.
[01:52:24.420 --> 01:52:25.420]   Thanks for joining us, everybody.
[01:52:25.420 --> 01:52:26.420]   This has been a fun twig.
[01:52:26.420 --> 01:52:28.460]   We want to thank Ant-Pruit for stopping by.
[01:52:28.460 --> 01:52:29.460]   Yeah.
[01:52:29.460 --> 01:52:30.460]   Yeah.
[01:52:30.460 --> 01:52:31.460]   Always love having Ant-Pruit.
[01:52:31.460 --> 01:52:32.460]   Thank you.
[01:52:32.460 --> 01:52:37.460]   And his mighty machine, his mighty water-cooled beast.
[01:52:37.460 --> 01:52:38.460]   I don't know.
[01:52:38.460 --> 01:52:39.460]   Air-cooled.
[01:52:39.460 --> 01:52:40.460]   Air-cooled.
[01:52:40.460 --> 01:52:41.460]   Air.
[01:52:41.460 --> 01:52:42.460]   You like it.
[01:52:42.460 --> 01:52:43.460]   It's so noisy.
[01:52:43.460 --> 01:52:44.460]   You like living days.
[01:52:44.460 --> 01:52:45.460]   All those fans, baby.
[01:52:45.460 --> 01:52:51.380]   Anything you want to plug, Ant, your Friday night videos?
[01:52:51.380 --> 01:52:56.980]   Check out TechRigpublic.com and just check out all of my stories that are over there.
[01:52:56.980 --> 01:53:02.980]   A lot of photography-related stuff, but I have a few enterprise IT things in there, too.
[01:53:02.980 --> 01:53:03.980]   Nice.
[01:53:03.980 --> 01:53:09.460]   And then jump on my YouTube channel, youtube.com/ant-pruit, and just go watch some of my stuff
[01:53:09.460 --> 01:53:10.460]   over there.
[01:53:10.460 --> 01:53:14.980]   I actually have a giveaway on one of the videos for the people that are interested in some
[01:53:14.980 --> 01:53:15.980]   photography gear.
[01:53:15.980 --> 01:53:17.980]   It's fun to watch the Friday night live.
[01:53:17.980 --> 01:53:20.340]   You can watch Ant-Work.
[01:53:20.340 --> 01:53:23.900]   And now we're in 17 minutes of Ant editing photos.
[01:53:23.900 --> 01:53:24.900]   That's awesome.
[01:53:24.900 --> 01:53:28.940]   That shot right there is that was shot with a pixel as well.
[01:53:28.940 --> 01:53:29.940]   What?
[01:53:29.940 --> 01:53:30.940]   Jeez.
[01:53:30.940 --> 01:53:31.940]   That's a hard shot.
[01:53:31.940 --> 01:53:34.140]   And that's pre-editing right there.
[01:53:34.140 --> 01:53:35.140]   Wow.
[01:53:35.140 --> 01:53:40.160]   That's a hard shot to get because it's two lights that would probably be very bright.
[01:53:40.160 --> 01:53:45.020]   So watch Ant-Work Friday night live.
[01:53:45.020 --> 01:53:46.020]   Thank you, sir.
[01:53:46.020 --> 01:53:51.580]   Kevin Toful is the editor-in-chief of a brand new site about Chromebooks.com that has become
[01:53:51.580 --> 01:53:52.580]   the immediately.
[01:53:52.580 --> 01:53:53.580]   My hero.
[01:53:53.580 --> 01:53:54.580]   Yeah, really awesome.
[01:53:54.580 --> 01:53:57.980]   I'm totally digging this.
[01:53:57.980 --> 01:54:01.900]   You can also hear him with Stacey Higginbotham on the IOT podcast.
[01:54:01.900 --> 01:54:02.900]   Yep.
[01:54:02.900 --> 01:54:05.340]   Yeah, the aboutcrumbooks.com site.
[01:54:05.340 --> 01:54:08.700]   Anytime you want to hose up your pixel book or whatever with Linux, this is the place
[01:54:08.700 --> 01:54:09.700]   to go.
[01:54:09.700 --> 01:54:10.700]   I'm rebooted it.
[01:54:10.700 --> 01:54:12.980]   I got rid of Mosh for some reason.
[01:54:12.980 --> 01:54:14.460]   It's not doing it.
[01:54:14.460 --> 01:54:15.820]   You got to get that secure shell going.
[01:54:15.820 --> 01:54:16.820]   I'm telling you.
[01:54:16.820 --> 01:54:17.820]   Yeah, I want to.
[01:54:17.820 --> 01:54:18.820]   I want to.
[01:54:18.820 --> 01:54:19.820]   I'm going to.
[01:54:19.820 --> 01:54:20.820]   All right.
[01:54:20.820 --> 01:54:21.820]   I'll read all the how-tos.
[01:54:21.820 --> 01:54:22.820]   I'll get it going.
[01:54:22.820 --> 01:54:25.700]   Just go ahead and wash it and then do it.
[01:54:25.700 --> 01:54:26.700]   Power wash and do it again.
[01:54:26.700 --> 01:54:29.100]   Maybe you don't really store it.
[01:54:29.100 --> 01:54:30.100]   There's nothing on here.
[01:54:30.100 --> 01:54:33.540]   I don't want power wash and I can watch it all day.
[01:54:33.540 --> 01:54:34.540]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:54:34.540 --> 01:54:35.540]   All day.
[01:54:35.540 --> 01:54:38.020]   I just got some new underwear though that I can't power wash.
[01:54:38.020 --> 01:54:39.020]   Wait a minute.
[01:54:39.020 --> 01:54:40.620]   So don't buy.
[01:54:40.620 --> 01:54:43.620]   Now you know it's the end of the week.
[01:54:43.620 --> 01:54:47.260]   Don't buy underwear on Instagram in the middle of the night.
[01:54:47.260 --> 01:54:50.620]   So this is one of the hazards of late night surfing.
[01:54:50.620 --> 01:54:53.340]   Some ads seem somehow magically.
[01:54:53.340 --> 01:54:55.940]   I buy the stupidest things.
[01:54:55.940 --> 01:54:57.860]   So I saw this ad for underwear.
[01:54:57.860 --> 01:54:59.540]   It's made out of eucalyptus trees.
[01:54:59.540 --> 01:55:00.860]   No, you didn't.
[01:55:00.860 --> 01:55:01.860]   You didn't.
[01:55:01.860 --> 01:55:03.420]   No, no, no.
[01:55:03.420 --> 01:55:05.820]   It's very nice and soft and stretchy.
[01:55:05.820 --> 01:55:06.820]   Okay.
[01:55:06.820 --> 01:55:07.820]   Looks really comfortable.
[01:55:07.820 --> 01:55:09.820]   So I bought five pairs, $20 each.
[01:55:09.820 --> 01:55:10.820]   Oh.
[01:55:10.820 --> 01:55:11.820]   Yeah, I know.
[01:55:11.820 --> 01:55:12.820]   I know.
[01:55:12.820 --> 01:55:14.220]   Oh, it was the middle of the night.
[01:55:14.220 --> 01:55:15.220]   I don't know.
[01:55:15.220 --> 01:55:16.220]   I was.
[01:55:16.220 --> 01:55:17.740]   You were the very precious junk there.
[01:55:17.740 --> 01:55:18.740]   I do.
[01:55:18.740 --> 01:55:19.740]   I bought it.
[01:55:19.740 --> 01:55:20.740]   It's the best for yours.
[01:55:20.740 --> 01:55:26.380]   Family jewels must be encased in velvet, but I open the box and it says be like a big
[01:55:26.380 --> 01:55:27.380]   thing.
[01:55:27.380 --> 01:55:32.100]   Be sure to read the care instructions before you wash your underwear.
[01:55:32.100 --> 01:55:35.100]   I thought, Oh God, what does this mean?
[01:55:35.100 --> 01:55:37.460]   Maybe it's because maybe you could lift this tree.
[01:55:37.460 --> 01:55:43.180]   I don't know, but you can only wash it on the delicate cycle and cool water and cool dry.
[01:55:43.180 --> 01:55:44.940]   It's like, well, that's no good.
[01:55:44.940 --> 01:55:45.940]   That's not good.
[01:55:45.940 --> 01:55:47.580]   That's no good.
[01:55:47.580 --> 01:55:48.580]   I'll be right back.
[01:55:48.580 --> 01:55:50.980]   You'll get that bag of magic beans.
[01:55:50.980 --> 01:55:53.140]   Just buy an Instagram ad.
[01:55:53.140 --> 01:55:54.700]   I'll be there, baby.
[01:55:54.700 --> 01:55:57.260]   I don't even want to tell you what I bought last night.
[01:55:57.260 --> 01:56:00.420]   Did you buy a bunch of capital Monte on the QVC back in the day?
[01:56:00.420 --> 01:56:04.860]   No, I was never, I would never fell for the shopping TV, but there's something about those
[01:56:04.860 --> 01:56:06.820]   Instagram ads that they're really worked.
[01:56:06.820 --> 01:56:07.820]   Don't they?
[01:56:07.820 --> 01:56:08.820]   Am I wrong?
[01:56:08.820 --> 01:56:09.820]   Am I the only one who does that?
[01:56:09.820 --> 01:56:10.820]   Yes, they are.
[01:56:10.820 --> 01:56:11.820]   You feel what it does.
[01:56:11.820 --> 01:56:12.820]   Really?
[01:56:12.820 --> 01:56:13.820]   I'm going to do that.
[01:56:13.820 --> 01:56:14.820]   You can lift this underwear.
[01:56:14.820 --> 01:56:15.820]   No.
[01:56:15.820 --> 01:56:17.740]   Do you have you flipping this underwear?
[01:56:17.740 --> 01:56:18.740]   I'm pretty sure I don't.
[01:56:18.740 --> 01:56:27.740]   I almost bought bamboo stuff too, but I thought, oh my God.
