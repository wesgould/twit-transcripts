[00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.600]   episode 15 for November 8, 2009.
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.600]   Google Throb.

[00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.440]   It's time for Twig this week in Google,
[00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.240]   just the three of us this week, starting
[00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:03.400]   with the wonderful, the talented Gina Tarpani
[00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.960]   from form founder of Life Hacker, and is still there,
[00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.680]   but also her own page, smarterware.org.
[00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:15.240]   And the new book, the new wave book, which is called--
[00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.360]   The Complete Guide to Google Wave.
[00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.720]   The Complete Guide to Google-- I got to write that down.
[00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.600]   Which is at completewaveguide.com,
[00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.520]   which I know is a little confusing.
[00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.640]   But the URL doesn't exactly match the name.
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.600]   Yeah, completewaveguide.com.
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.360]   So you can participate in the creation of the book,
[00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.200]   read it as it's going in Adam Pash, of course,
[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.760]   from Life Hacker working on that with you.
[00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:35.680]   That is awesome.
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:36.180]   Yeah.
[00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.360]   I've got to read it because I've kind of stopped using wave.
[00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.520]   It's like, I don't get it.
[00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:41.020]   Yeah.
[00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.520]   Yeah.
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.360]   I think a lot of people have.
[00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.400]   I've got to get back to wave, man.
[00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.520]   Also here, Mr. Jeff Jarvis of buzzmachine.com,
[00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.080]   the great journalist and journalistic observer.
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.320]   You guys are going to travel.
[00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.080]   Gina is going to be next week at web 2.0.
[00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.880]   Jeff is going to be at Yale giving a lecture.
[00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.960]   So the show will be on the air a little late next week.
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.200]   We'll do it Sunday at 5 PM Eastern, right before Twit
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.000]   on Twit Live.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.360]   And then it'll come out a day late Sunday afternoon.
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.800]   But meanwhile, we're here together today to talk about Google.
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.200]   Did you buy the droid?
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.680]   Gina?
[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:18.920]   I held myself back.
[00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:20.320]   I'm close with last.
[00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.240]   But I held myself back.
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.600]   I saw you doing that on Twitter.
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.040]   You were kind of begging for help.
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.640]   Stop me.
[00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.880]   Stop me before I buy it.
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.640]   I want this phone so bad.
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:31.640]   It hurts me.
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.240]   I'm just-- I'm trying to be frugal, insensible.
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.040]   Anil Dash and I did that site called the last years model
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.120]   that were, which is kind of talking about how important it
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.440]   is to hold on to our gadgets and appreciate them
[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.880]   and not sort of mindlessly buy whenever something new comes out.
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:45.720]   That's communist.
[00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:46.240]   Who?
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.800]   That's terrible.
[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.960]   That's why they call it was in trouble, darn it.
[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.600]   You could blame last year's model for that.
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.160]   I feel like I'd let down the entire last year's model crew
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.360]   if I had gotten out and buy the droid.
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.200]   But it is killing me.
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:58.680]   And in fact, this morning, I was like, you know what?
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.160]   I'm just going to go to the Verizon store
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:03.480]   and check out the phone because it's my duty as a host of Twig
[00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.240]   to have held this thing and really understand what it does.
[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.080]   No, you have to.
[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.160]   I just-- I didn't do it because I knew that I would buy it.
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.640]   And one thing, I'm traveling to London in a couple of weeks.
[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:14.400]   And I knew that the phone wouldn't work over there.
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.560]   So I'm going to stick my thing with it.
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.680]   Yeah, that's the thing.
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.560]   I'm going to take-- I'm going to need my GSM phone
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:20.960]   in a couple of weeks anyway.
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.200]   And so-- but I am really filled with lust.
[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:26.040]   It just-- oh, god, it looks like such a good phone.
[00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.760]   The hardware looks so much better.
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.840]   Android 2.0 looks great.
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.080]   Although, Leo, I want to hear from you
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.680]   about what you think about EKler, because it doesn't seem
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.840]   like there's a whole lot of software updates, right?
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:36.360]   No.
[00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.520]   No, EKler doesn't seem to be a huge difference.
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.600]   In fact, the droid is the only phone that's using EKler 2.0.
[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.520]   All the other Android phones are still stuck with one 6
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.080]   or, in some cases, even one 5.
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.960]   They're still donut.
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:52.880]   How's the cupcake?
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:53.880]   It's a kupcake.
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:54.320]   It's donut.
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:55.960]   It's an alphabetical order, so it was--
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:56.480]   Oh.
[00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.000]   --donut cupcake EKler.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.240]   Oh, that makes it easy.
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.840]   You mean cupcake donut EKler.
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:01.400]   Oh, excuse me.
[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.760]   Cupcake donut EKler, yes.
[00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.160]   And then Fronjaponi next week.
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.280]   I don't think so.
[00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:09.120]   That's a no problem.
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.640]   I don't know.
[00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:10.720]   Fry dough.
[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.920]   Next week, the Google Android Fry dough edition.
[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:16.600]   What happens after they get to the Zeppoli?
[00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.160]   I mean, then what?
[00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.160]   Start a gonna day.
[00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.000]   I don't think it was a world that we'll all stop updates.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.320]   They left out canole.
[00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:24.400]   I mean, come on.
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.000]   Yeah, no, sir.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.200]   These times are not happy about this.
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.240]   Pressure raged.
[00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.680]   Take the phone, leave the canole.
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.480]   So the Android--
[00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.320]   or I'm sure-- sorry, I should say the droid,
[00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.200]   the Verizon Droid, is Gina Spectacular.
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:40.200]   Oh.
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.600]   It is Spectacular.
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.240]   Colleen got one.
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:44.400]   She got one day one.
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:47.800]   I saw a pre-release version that Natalie Delcotti had
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.120]   from CNET.
[00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:50.760]   Best screen I've ever seen on a phone.
[00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.120]   I mean, it is roughly the same size as the Apple screen,
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.200]   but higher resolution.
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:58.000]   Gorgeous, really legible screen.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.560]   Some complaints about the keyboard.
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.600]   The keyboard keys are not very well differentiated.
[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:07.200]   And there are slight raises, but not sufficient for you
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.240]   to know where your fingers are.
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.880]   So it is--
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:09.480]   I don't know.
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:10.360]   It's a bad design.
[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.960]   I don't know why they didn't distinguish
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.560]   one key from another better.
[00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:15.840]   Yeah, that's what I heard, though.
[00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.840]   The keyboard wasn't fabulous.
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:18.280]   It's a--
[00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:19.200]   But headphone jack, right?
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:19.920]   True headphone jack.
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:20.920]   True headphone jack.
[00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.800]   So you can listen to your favorite tunes without--
[00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.440]   And like, smoke and camera, right?
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:27.440]   But the pictures on the camera, the pictures of the camera
[00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:27.760]   good?
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:28.960]   No, not smoke and camera.
[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.240]   It's a five megapixel camera, but I am not
[00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.760]   overwhelmed by the quality.
[00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.040]   The video looks pretty--
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:38.520]   I mean, look, it's two megapixels better than the iPhone.
[00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.360]   But the--
[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.200]   I don't-- you know, we've got these cheesy plastic lenses.
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:44.920]   And it's got auto-focus.
[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:48.000]   It shoots decent video.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.880]   Andy and Naco did a fantastic review.
[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:52.320]   And he did see-- he took some photos side by side
[00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.000]   with the iPhone and Android.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.840]   And the iPhone photos, despite the less mega-pixelage,
[00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:58.600]   look much better.
[00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.560]   Better software, I think.
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.240]   Right, because the iPhone's tapped a focus, right?
[00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.880]   Which Android doesn't have.
[00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:06.600]   Yeah.
[00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:07.960]   But it has a flash, right?
[00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:09.080]   It has-- well, come on.
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.520]   LED flashes in Nemec.
[00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:15.320]   It's not going to make any big difference, I don't think.
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.200]   And sometimes a flash can make a picture worse.
[00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:20.440]   So I would say in the camera section, this is a wash.
[00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:22.240]   It's not spectacular.
[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.800]   And I'm going to be honest about--
[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:24.400]   Dora, you're right.
[00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:27.200]   2.0 doesn't seem that much different than 1.6.
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:29.880]   And these are small incremental improvements.
[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:34.040]   And I don't think Android is that polished quite yet to me.
[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:34.880]   Right.
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:35.520]   Right.
[00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:36.920]   That seems to be the consensus, right?
[00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:38.040]   That it's like on the verge.
[00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:39.800]   So I think Andy's conclusion was like,
[00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.600]   this is a smartphone that's now sort of in the same class
[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:43.320]   as the iPhone.
[00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:44.320]   Yes.
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:48.480]   But it's not a definite iPhone killer.
[00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:51.080]   But we're more on level than ever before,
[00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:52.360]   that it's grown in leaps and bounds.
[00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.480]   I mean, the other big thing with Eig Claire,
[00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:58.560]   is the car home screen and the turn-by-turn direction.
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:01.880]   So I can mount this thing to my dashboard, right?
[00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:04.560]   And then if I have the mount, and I
[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.120]   can kick it into Carmo, right?
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:07.800]   And so Carmo, the car home screen is what?
[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:11.040]   It's just a couple of big icons that you would tap
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:11.880]   if you were driving.
[00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:13.160]   You know, I haven't seen that.
[00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.280]   But I've talked to people who've used the navigation to say
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:16.080]   it's quite good.
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:20.840]   In fact, John Belmont, a newscaster extraordinaire,
[00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:24.000]   told me that when he got to where his destination was,
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.280]   it showed the street view of his house.
[00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:30.840]   You get to watch instead of just plain old cartoony maps,
[00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:32.240]   you get to watch the satellite maps.
[00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:33.920]   Another person told me, it's just like you're watching
[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:36.360]   yourself drive down the street.
[00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:36.840]   Wow.
[00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:38.680]   It'll tell you what you're searching for in that house.
[00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:40.480]   Yeah.
[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:41.920]   This is not the droid you're looking.
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:43.880]   But the interesting-- I'm sorry, I had to use it.
[00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.880]   The interesting point, or important point, I guess,
[00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:51.080]   to make is that the maps are downloaded as you go.
[00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:54.360]   It may cache some, but unlike a true GPS,
[00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:57.680]   or even the iPhone GPS apps, the maps are not stored locally.
[00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:58.120]   OK.
[00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:00.680]   So no 3G means no map.
[00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:01.760]   Right, right.
[00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:04.360]   And I hear that the Gmail client, which is awesome,
[00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:06.040]   and one of the main reasons why I use Android
[00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:07.960]   is because my life is in Gmail, and it's so great,
[00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:10.080]   is that it now supports multiple accounts, which
[00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:12.080]   is probably like a geek's only type thing.
[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:14.240]   But a lot of people have more than one Gmail account.
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:15.440]   And so now you can switch.
[00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:18.440]   On my G1, you sign in with one Google account,
[00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:20.120]   and you're tied to it.
[00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:22.480]   So you can do multiple accounts now.
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:23.080]   I do think--
[00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:24.240]   A little something.
[00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:27.440]   So Leo, you say it's polished, but not polished enough.
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:30.400]   I presume it beats the hell out of a Microsoft mobile.
[00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:30.960]   Well, you know why.
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:32.040]   And Symbian, too.
[00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:32.800]   Yeah.
[00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:35.000]   I mean, one of the conclusions you have to draw
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.640]   is that both Symbian and Windows Mobile are dead,
[00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:43.480]   that it really is now down to Apple, Android, with--
[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:47.160]   and depending on what the N900 does from Nokia, the MIMO--
[00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:48.680]   I mean, I think Nokia's kind of out of the game.
[00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:51.880]   But we got to remember Nokia still sells more handsets
[00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:55.240]   in a day than Apple sells in a quarter.
[00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:55.600]   Mostly--
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:57.480]   That has incredible worldwide penetration.
[00:08:57.480 --> 00:08:58.680]   It's mostly international.
[00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:01.240]   And it's mostly cheap candy bar headsets.
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:02.520]   Nevertheless, handsets.
[00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:04.520]   But nevertheless, they're still in the game.
[00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:07.240]   And their MIMO is basically their version of Linux,
[00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:09.520]   just as Android is Google's version of Linux.
[00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:12.200]   I ordered an N900, because that is world.
[00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:14.920]   And I have to say, I cannot use a CDMA phone.
[00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:16.760]   It's not going to work for me.
[00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:17.760]   Yeah.
[00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:18.680]   Is there going to be--
[00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:22.840]   Is there any rumored schedule for droid with GSM?
[00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:25.920]   Well, I think it wouldn't be Verizon.
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:27.280]   I think Verizon's got the exclusive for a ride.
[00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:28.000]   Well, I'll say it's for Ford.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.840]   If I can go buy one in England.
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:31.840]   Right.
[00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:34.440]   You know, get an unlocked one in Europe.
[00:09:34.440 --> 00:09:36.080]   I'll be market for that fast.
[00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:37.320]   That's a good question.
[00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:38.320]   I don't know.
[00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:41.680]   I haven't heard Motorola selling it to anybody else.
[00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:42.520]   And I love Andy.
[00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:45.680]   Andy is such a way with words.
[00:09:45.680 --> 00:09:47.120]   He says, the latest generation--
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:48.520]   and you bookmarked this, Gina.
[00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:50.800]   The latest generation of Android hardware and software
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:53.040]   is Apple's worst nightmare.
[00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:55.960]   They've discovered that over the summer, the sickly kid
[00:09:55.960 --> 00:10:00.880]   with asthma grew five inches and put on 30 pounds of muscle.
[00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:01.520]   I love that.
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:03.640]   You know, he buried-- that was the last paragraph.
[00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:05.360]   And it was a long review.
[00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:06.360]   That's typical.
[00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:08.360]   You know, the best paragraph and the whole thing
[00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:09.040]   is buried at the end.
[00:10:09.040 --> 00:10:11.480]   It was like a prize for someone that had lasted.
[00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:12.640]   He writes great reviews.
[00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:13.640]   I love Andy.
[00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:14.120]   Yeah.
[00:10:14.120 --> 00:10:17.080]   He really-- he's a master of the language.
[00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:18.640]   Yeah, he really liked it.
[00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:21.640]   I would say-- I maybe even like a little bit more.
[00:10:21.640 --> 00:10:25.040]   There's no question in my mind if you're a Verizon customer,
[00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:28.440]   you should stay with Verizon and you should get the droid.
[00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:30.880]   I don't think it's worth switching to AT&T for the iPhone.
[00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:33.440]   And by the way, Leo, they usually
[00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:36.560]   they give a discount to new customers for these phones.
[00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:39.640]   In this case, I saw online that Verizon gives a discount
[00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:41.200]   to existing customers.
[00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:45.080]   It's $199 for new customers, $149 for existing--
[00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:46.640]   That's interesting.
[00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:47.640]   Is that different?
[00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:50.960]   I also saw by the way that in the data plans--
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:53.200]   because I, too, Gina, was just asking this for any way
[00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:55.920]   I can justify this without getting divorced--
[00:10:55.920 --> 00:11:01.440]   and they promise you a nationwide email.
[00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:02.000]   I love that.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.400]   Well, what if I only want to pay for Jersey?
[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:04.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:05.880]   Nationwide email.
[00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:06.880]   What is that?
[00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:07.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:09.120]   What does that mean?
[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:09.920]   Well, no.
[00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:11.360]   It's just such a Verizon talk.
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:12.760]   It is.
[00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:13.520]   It's our nationwide email.
[00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:14.520]   You know, I had it.
[00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:18.960]   And obviously, it's $26, $2,700 commitment to get that phone.
[00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:21.840]   And, you know, to your-- and just--
[00:11:21.840 --> 00:11:24.200]   I blogged immediately that I want to create.
[00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:26.000]   And Gina joined in on this.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.360]   He gadgeted a month club.
[00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:30.160]   I want to at least get the phone for one month.
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:31.400]   I'll pay a premium on that month.
[00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:32.600]   I'll pay more.
[00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:35.240]   I want a lot of different gadgets to be able to come in.
[00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:36.640]   Some I'll get in the fourth month.
[00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:37.160]   I don't care.
[00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:39.800]   Some I'll pay extra to get in the first month.
[00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:46.280]   And I even got the CMO of Best Buy noodling on it via Twitter.
[00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:47.800]   I want to get my hands on it.
[00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:50.600]   Even if I don't own it, I want to have it for a while.
[00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:51.120]   Yeah.
[00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:51.480]   Yeah.
[00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:52.880]   And I think it'd be a great marketing trick,
[00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:54.320]   because I think enough people would be--
[00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:57.040]   you, Gina, if you had it for a month, you'd buy it.
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:57.520]   Oh, yeah.
[00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:58.040]   You're right.
[00:11:58.040 --> 00:11:59.640]   But if you'd be sucked in--
[00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:00.840]   Dead cold hands.
[00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:01.840]   Yeah.
[00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:02.840]   I probably would.
[00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:06.960]   Leo has me thinking about the whole review unit thing.
[00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:08.360]   I guess I could have really--
[00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:09.200]   I could have asked.
[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:10.120]   You could have gotten a unit.
[00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:11.760]   I probably could have talked to some people
[00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:13.120]   and tried to get a review unit.
[00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:14.680]   I probably could have gotten one.
[00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:16.320]   I didn't-- it's hard.
[00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:18.240]   And actually, I would have to talk to both of you
[00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:18.840]   about this more.
[00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:21.040]   It's like, if I get a review unit and I get to use it,
[00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:22.640]   it's not kind of the same thing as me going out
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:23.640]   and spending my own money.
[00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:24.520]   You know what I mean?
[00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:28.080]   That's exactly why I buy things, because I don't think
[00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:30.880]   you get the true experience unless you commit.
[00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:31.720]   Right.
[00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:34.720]   You put your data on it and you say, this is my phone,
[00:12:34.720 --> 00:12:38.040]   buy, buy iPhone, or G1, and you use it.
[00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:40.320]   And I feel the same way about laptops and everything else.
[00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:42.520]   And it's actually the hardest thing about being a reviewer.
[00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:44.440]   And I did that for years.
[00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:46.840]   You got it for a week, or you got it for two weeks.
[00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:49.320]   And you just never really commit to it.
[00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:50.880]   So you really don't get the experience
[00:12:50.880 --> 00:12:52.120]   that somebody who's put their harder
[00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:53.680]   and money on the counter.
[00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:54.200]   Right.
[00:12:54.200 --> 00:12:55.560]   At the same time, though, I think
[00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:59.640]   people who spend the money and buy it psychologically,
[00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:02.360]   you want to convince yourself that it's the best thing ever.
[00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:02.880]   And tell everybody to tell.
[00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:03.440]   That's true.
[00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:04.680]   Because you've spent your money on it.
[00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:05.160]   You know what I mean?
[00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:06.520]   It's the Stockholm of syndrome.
[00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:07.640]   I mean, it's absolutely.
[00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:08.160]   Yeah.
[00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:11.280]   I definitely found myself defending Android and my G1,
[00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:13.280]   which has a lot of problems that people know about,
[00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:15.160]   just because I spent the money and I did it
[00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:16.240]   and I made the leap.
[00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:17.400]   So it's like--
[00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:18.840]   Well, it's particularly hard with phones,
[00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:23.640]   because nowadays they change even faster than PCs do.
[00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:25.080]   So you're really--
[00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:26.840]   I mean, I have accounts with all the carriers
[00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:30.240]   and I spend ridiculous sums of money.
[00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:32.040]   And I don't know why I haven't bought it.
[00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:35.280]   By the way, the chatroom tells me good news.
[00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:38.960]   There is a GSM phone, Jeff, of GSM version of the droid.
[00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:42.160]   It's called the milestone, the Motorola milestone.
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:45.280]   O2 in Germany is selling it.
[00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:46.040]   Now?
[00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:48.360]   Yeah, 816 bucks.
[00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:50.160]   Gina, aren't you going to London soon?
[00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:51.840]   500 in Germany, and you got it.
[00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:53.400]   Well, if O2 in Germany is selling it,
[00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:55.280]   I presume they'd sell it in England too.
[00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:56.520]   They're also in England English care.
[00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:57.400]   What's it called, like a layer?
[00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:58.600]   Milestone.
[00:13:58.600 --> 00:13:59.320]   Milestone.
[00:13:59.320 --> 00:14:01.760]   All right, yep, that might be--
[00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:02.840]   Google that right now.
[00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:04.200]   And I love it, because in Germany,
[00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:06.240]   they call mobile phones "handies."
[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:06.880]   Yes, they do.
[00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:08.200]   My handy.
[00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:10.200]   Because I thought it was because it was convenient,
[00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:11.960]   because it fits in the hand.
[00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:14.160]   Yeah, it's a handy phone.
[00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:16.080]   You heard Stephen Fry's little.
[00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:17.800]   I lost my handy.
[00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:22.320]   It's very funny.
[00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:23.320]   I am impressed.
[00:14:23.320 --> 00:14:25.760]   The real milestone is announced in Brazil.
[00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:27.120]   There you go.
[00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:30.960]   Um, ooh.
[00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:31.960]   Ooh.
[00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:33.960]   Ooh.
[00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:35.400]   My nadocia, Freunden.
[00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:35.920]   Yeah.
[00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:37.400]   You're going to get the handy.
[00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:38.200]   It's a handy milestone.
[00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:40.560]   Yeah, the handy milestone.
[00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:44.440]   Wouldn't visit dock will stand up very nicely.
[00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:47.040]   So I have to say, it's heavier than the iPhone.
[00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:50.040]   And so it feels in the hand, in some ways,
[00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:52.000]   very solid, almost too tonic.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.440]   It's got this feel to it.
[00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:57.920]   And some say maybe that's a little heavy.
[00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:02.480]   I think the only negative that I can see is that keyboard.
[00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:03.560]   At least you have one.
[00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:04.560]   I think that's what.
[00:15:04.560 --> 00:15:07.600]   Arianian went orgasmic over the thing on Tech Cry.
[00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:09.120]   He must have got a free one.
[00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:10.880]   Yeah, we'll not stand anything.
[00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:14.200]   [HUMMING]
[00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:15.760]   But I think he was saying--
[00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:18.240]   I hope I think it was Arianian who just said, well,
[00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:21.560]   the good news is, as a keyboard, the bad news is this keyboard.
[00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:23.280]   Yeah, that's exactly right.
[00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:24.720]   Good, it's good and bad.
[00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:25.960]   Now this is a huge success.
[00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:30.240]   And it puts Android solidly on the map.
[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:35.720]   And by the way, 12,000 apps in the Android store
[00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:38.800]   than the Android marketplace, that's not insignificant.
[00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:40.200]   It means that there's a good chance
[00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:41.840]   you're going to find the app you need.
[00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:44.480]   Yes, admittedly, there's 100,000 in the Apple store,
[00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:46.200]   but 12,000.
[00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:47.840]   There's going to be a lot of stuff
[00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:49.640]   that you're not going to feel like, well,
[00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:51.640]   I can't find anything there.
[00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:53.080]   Yeah, it's a solid number.
[00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:54.360]   It can get better.
[00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:56.080]   It needs to get better.
[00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:57.640]   But I think that with 2.0, we're going
[00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:00.080]   to get a bigger commitment from developers.
[00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:03.440]   And I hope the quality will go up as well.
[00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:04.720]   But it's a solid number.
[00:16:04.720 --> 00:16:07.400]   It's a great number.
[00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:09.080]   I'm impressed.
[00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:15.000]   I think there is definitely a real competitor.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   So Leo, what phone do you carry around with you?
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   I'm still an iPhone guy.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.480]   I'm waiting for this N900 to come.
[00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:22.600]   It's been way delayed.
[00:16:22.600 --> 00:16:25.680]   Apparently, they want to do some cleanup to MIMO or MIMO,
[00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:26.800]   the Linux.
[00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:31.400]   But it has a very good 5 megapixel camera.
[00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:32.280]   No kit is good.
[00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:35.800]   Camera is the N95 had an excellent camera.
[00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:38.840]   And it's got a huge screen.
[00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:40.040]   I think it's 800 by 480.
[00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:40.960]   No, is that right?
[00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:41.840]   600 by 480.
[00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:43.920]   It's a very high res screen.
[00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:46.000]   Touch, it's got the same kind of multitasking
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.920]   the pre-has where you slide over the window
[00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:50.560]   you're looking at to see the other windows behind it.
[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:51.560]   Yeah, that's sweet.
[00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:53.280]   I think that's one--
[00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:57.160]   yes, the Android does multitask.
[00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:58.320]   A plus there.
[00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:03.640]   But I think I like being able to switch between applications
[00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:04.640]   a little bit better.
[00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:05.160]   Yeah.
[00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:07.520]   About the Nokia netbook.
[00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:09.600]   Is that any different from any other netbook?
[00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:10.100]   No.
[00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:10.920]   It's coming out.
[00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:11.960]   No.
[00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:14.560]   And it's very-- it's pricey.
[00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:18.520]   But that has built-in EVDO or built-in 3G network.
[00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:19.800]   I'm really looking forward to--
[00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:20.920]   you know, it's going to be very exciting
[00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:24.000]   is when these fourth generation networks start coming online.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.600]   And everybody's saying, oh, our 4G is coming.
[00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:28.480]   Even T-Mobile, our 4G is coming.
[00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:30.640]   It's a chance for T-Mobile to leapfrog everybody
[00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:32.080]   if they can get it out quickly.
[00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:33.920]   That's so fast.
[00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:36.080]   It's as fast as your cable modem.
[00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:38.400]   Well, I was at the Four Square Conference in New York
[00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:38.840]   this week.
[00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:41.600]   And the heads of Qualcomm and Google and Nokia
[00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:43.160]   were there talking.
[00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:45.880]   It's off the record, but there's no secrets here.
[00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:51.640]   And they were talking about 5 to 10 megs down and up.
[00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:53.320]   And that becomes real.
[00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:55.400]   Then, man, everything changes.
[00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:56.200]   And then--
[00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:58.280]   And then a Qualcomm showed a new screen.
[00:17:58.280 --> 00:17:59.240]   It was just a prototype.
[00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:01.480]   But it was not e-ink.
[00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:02.800]   It was another kind of screen that
[00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:07.960]   was full-color, full-motion, very, very low power
[00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:11.360]   that you could see in ambient light.
[00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:13.920]   And so basically, it becomes always on.
[00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:15.280]   You're not going to be over your phone
[00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:16.680]   and hitting a button to see what's going on.
[00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:17.840]   It's just there and on.
[00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:20.640]   And it starts to change the sense of permanence and ubiquity
[00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:21.840]   that you have.
[00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:24.480]   Eric Spint was just lurching for it, saying, wins it out!
[00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:26.280]   wins it out!
[00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:28.160]   You know, one thing we didn't mention that a lot of people
[00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:29.640]   are loving is the Google Voice--
[00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:34.320]   or the Google Search app, the voice-based search
[00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:36.000]   app that comes on the Droid.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.720]   And I've seen several demos of it now.
[00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:40.200]   It searches phone-wide.
[00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:42.800]   It's basically like the one that was on the iPhone,
[00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:45.040]   except it's a phone-wide search.
[00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:47.280]   And people are saying it's extremely accurate.
[00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:50.600]   Again, the benefit that Google gets from that Google 411.
[00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:51.600]   Yeah.
[00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:52.600]   I felt like--
[00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:55.680]   --a better job of Google Voice transcription than.
[00:18:55.680 --> 00:19:01.120]   I linked to-- there was a slideshow of classic Google Voice
[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:01.840]   screw-ups.
[00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:04.760]   I've been waiting for somebody to do this.
[00:19:04.760 --> 00:19:05.260]   Yeah.
[00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:06.920]   Yeah, that was just waiting to happen.
[00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:07.600]   They're classic.
[00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:09.360]   Let me see if I can pull it up for people.
[00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:10.600]   We can take a look at it.
[00:19:10.600 --> 00:19:12.040]   For those of you who are watching at home,
[00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:15.720]   the rest of you will just have to go there on your own.
[00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:18.800]   Now, Donut has a voice-activated search,
[00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:21.120]   and also searches phone-wide.
[00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:21.680]   Did it change?
[00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:22.800]   And I clear?
[00:19:22.800 --> 00:19:23.840]   Was there--
[00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:25.560]   Oh, that's a good point.
[00:19:25.560 --> 00:19:26.680]   No, I think it's the same as it.
[00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:27.160]   The same.
[00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:28.240]   Yeah, it's good.
[00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:29.040]   It's really good.
[00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:31.080]   In fact, sometimes I use it--
[00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:32.800]   you know, my wife tells me, stop showing off,
[00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:34.560]   because I'm like, shh, shh, I have to search now.
[00:19:34.560 --> 00:19:35.040]   Yeah.
[00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:35.880]   That's the only negative.
[00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:36.600]   I was at a party.
[00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:38.240]   A guy was trying to show me this.
[00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:41.040]   And we had to say, shh, shh.
[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:42.720]   I'm dictating here.
[00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:44.680]   If it's noisy at all, it just stops working.
[00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:45.600]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:47.040]   Yeah.
[00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:47.880]   Quiet.
[00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:50.080]   Best worst Google voice transcription errors.
[00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:51.960]   This is from CNET.
[00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:53.440]   And they put--
[00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:55.160]   and this is-- I'm starting to hate this on the web,
[00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:56.840]   because they get more web hits.
[00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:58.360]   I know the slideshow thing, yeah.
[00:19:58.360 --> 00:20:01.040]   So sick of this.
[00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:02.640]   In fact, I'm not even going to--
[00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:04.600]   I don't want to even give many credit for it.
[00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:05.160]   Punish them.
[00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:06.440]   Just look, and you could see it.
[00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:08.560]   But you've got to click Next, Next, Next, Next.
[00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:09.920]   And I guess they've been taking them on--
[00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:12.520]   because some of these Twitter pages, some of them.
[00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:13.680]   Yeah, you know what?
[00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:16.200]   I don't even think it's funny, because I've seen them all.
[00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:16.640]   Yeah.
[00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:18.800]   Been there.
[00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:19.280]   Sorry.
[00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:22.040]   Had the band bad transcription.
[00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:25.520]   Have you been noticing that I haven't seen it on my Google
[00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:27.440]   page, but I've seen pictures of it.
[00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:29.880]   Maybe it was only on Droid Ship Day.
[00:20:29.880 --> 00:20:32.880]   But Google-- I can't remember this ever happening
[00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:36.800]   before on their front page had a link to buy the Droid.
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:38.000]   Right, that's really important.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.920]   That's the first Google ad I think we've ever seen, right?
[00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:42.600]   On the front page.
[00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:45.760]   You know, no, I saw that once before when
[00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:48.000]   they rolled out social stuff in Google Reader.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.720]   I mean, they usually do it to point out their own products.
[00:20:50.720 --> 00:20:51.760]   I mean, Droid counts, right?
[00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:52.520]   Because it's Android.
[00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:53.040]   It's the first one.
[00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:54.560]   It's for sale.
[00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:56.040]   Right, I see what you're saying.
[00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:56.840]   That this thing is--
[00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:59.040]   Right, so they're pointing to a product.
[00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:01.640]   And so not even their product.
[00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:04.920]   But it has said that by not putting ads on the homepage,
[00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:08.720]   they are foregoing billions of dollars a year.
[00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:11.640]   Think how many views that one link got.
[00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:13.640]   And I wonder if they got some money from Verizon for that.
[00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:15.200]   Certainly Verizon is very happy.
[00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:19.520]   But it does show Google's commitment to making Droid a hit.
[00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:20.120]   Yeah.
[00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:23.800]   I mean, that's, I guess, if nothing else, that's the--
[00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:24.760]   No, that's really important.
[00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:27.560]   You're right, because otherwise with Google's beta think,
[00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:29.480]   they tend to kind of stand back and say, it'll work.
[00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:29.840]   It won't work.
[00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:31.360]   Well, that's what they've done.
[00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:32.680]   That's what they've done up to now.
[00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:33.920]   That's what G1--
[00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:34.880]   Really a good point.
[00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:38.120]   Wasn't a lot of commitment to Android until now.
[00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:42.560]   What is the story of Android-based networks?
[00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:44.760]   Is that third party or is that Google now saying,
[00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:47.000]   we're going to start doing Android-based networks
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.520]   or Android-based hardware?
[00:21:49.520 --> 00:21:51.520]   I think there was a third party announcement for early next
[00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:52.360]   year.
[00:21:52.360 --> 00:21:54.000]   But it's not Google doing it.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.320]   I don't believe it's Google.
[00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:56.320]   OK, I guess--
[00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:58.960]   There are a few different Android-based things, right?
[00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:01.120]   Coming out, there's like photo frames.
[00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:03.440]   And what was the other thing?
[00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:04.120]   Is the nook?
[00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:05.600]   The nook is Android-based, right?
[00:22:05.600 --> 00:22:06.920]   The nook-y?
[00:22:06.920 --> 00:22:07.560]   Yeah, the nook-y.
[00:22:07.560 --> 00:22:08.240]   Nook-y?
[00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:08.760]   Book-related.
[00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:11.600]   I did not for the nook-y.
[00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:14.480]   Max Tamek, who's a friend on Twitter, said, didn't they just
[00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:16.960]   ask one 14-year-old about the brand?
[00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:17.480]   It's fun.
[00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:22.720]   They're obviously not parents, because any parent naming
[00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:24.640]   their kids going to ask that question,
[00:22:24.640 --> 00:22:26.360]   you'd think they would know.
[00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:28.720]   It's pretty funny.
[00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:30.320]   Oh my goodness.
[00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:31.160]   Let's see.
[00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:31.840]   Let's take a break.
[00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:32.480]   We're going to come back.
[00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:34.080]   There's lots to talk about.
[00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:37.840]   Even, yes, some wave news, some Twitter news.
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:39.240]   PB works.
[00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:41.840]   Getting a makeover.
[00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:44.800]   I guess it's the wiki that Google purchased.
[00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:46.160]   We'll talk about all of that in just a second.
[00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:48.000]   But right now, I want to talk about our friends at Citrix
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.640]   and the great go-to assist.
[00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:54.920]   We used go-to assist in the early days on the screen savers.
[00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:57.960]   Did it actually fix people's computer by remote control?
[00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:01.520]   Go-to assist has gotten so much better, so much more powerful,
[00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:03.760]   so much faster, so much more affordable.
[00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:05.920]   They've introduced day passes for go-to assist.
[00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:09.840]   So if you've got a parent or a friend who just needs a little
[00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:11.240]   hand, you can use it.
[00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:14.920]   But it's really aimed at the tech support professional.
[00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:19.480]   Somebody with software to support, or perhaps maybe you're
[00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:22.160]   in an IT business.
[00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:23.240]   I want you to try it.
[00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:25.520]   You could try it for free right now by going to go to
[00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:30.920]   assist.com/twig/twig.
[00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:32.480]   And get a 30-day free trial.
[00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:35.800]   Now, what is different from this from Citrix to other remote
[00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:37.480]   access product, go-to-my-PC?
[00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:40.640]   Well, it's kind of like on top of go-to-my-PC, they've added
[00:23:40.640 --> 00:23:43.680]   really great features a tech support pro would want.
[00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:45.440]   The ability to run unattended support.
[00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:47.960]   Up to eight sessions at once, so you're never tied down
[00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:51.000]   waiting for one session to finish one scanner install.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:53.520]   You've got the ability to see what operating system, what
[00:23:53.520 --> 00:23:55.840]   security software is running on the computer.
[00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:58.320]   You can transfer files from your-- you just drag them over
[00:23:58.320 --> 00:23:59.920]   from your computer to the other computer.
[00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:01.840]   And it's really easy for your client.
[00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:04.040]   Your client doesn't even have to have any software installed.
[00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:06.680]   You don't have to say, OK, run out, get some software, and
[00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:07.280]   then we'll talk.
[00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:09.040]   No, all you do is you send them a link.
[00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:09.680]   They click the link.
[00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:14.080]   It takes them to go to assist.com, a little Java, a bit of
[00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:15.080]   Java installs.
[00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:18.360]   And all of a sudden, you can fix their computer remote
[00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:20.880]   control and become a tech support hero.
[00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:23.040]   Try it free for 30 days.
[00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:25.520]   It's got all the great features Citrix is known for.
[00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:28.200]   128-bit end-to-end encryption.
[00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:31.040]   Free 24/7 custom support.
[00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:34.920]   Nat traversals you never have to worry about firewalls or
[00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:36.520]   routers getting in the way.
[00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:40.160]   Go to assist.com/twig.
[00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:42.040]   Please give it a try.
[00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:44.040]   I know you're going to love it.
[00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:47.520]   Go to assist express from Citrix.
[00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:50.640]   We thank them so much for their support of this week in
[00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:51.040]   Google.
[00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:55.280]   So what's going on, Jeff Jarvis, with Google News?
[00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:57.800]   They're letting you create your own topic pages?
[00:24:57.800 --> 00:24:58.280]   Right.
[00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:02.600]   It's not a big deal, but they're bringing in a little bit of
[00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:04.080]   personal aggregation, curation.
[00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:05.880]   And then the interesting part is that you can then publish
[00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:06.720]   that.
[00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:09.320]   So of course, I went to it and I created a Google News page
[00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:12.560]   about Google that appears on my page, no big deal, but I
[00:25:12.560 --> 00:25:14.640]   can start to publish that to the world.
[00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:17.160]   And if you get more complicated about it, if you did Google
[00:25:17.160 --> 00:25:20.120]   plus Eric Schmidt, but not this, what's that?
[00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:24.160]   People who come up with good topic pages can kind of become
[00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:25.560]   the new editors of the web.
[00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:29.680]   So did you embed it on your page so that you can see it at
[00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:30.120]   all times?
[00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:31.800]   I mean, what exactly?
[00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:32.720]   It did that automatically.
[00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:36.480]   Not a Buzz machine, but on my Google News page.
[00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:39.120]   Oh, on your Google News page.
[00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:40.840]   So wait, so where's that?
[00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:42.000]   It's news@google.com/
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:43.800]   I knew you'd ask me that, darn it.
[00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:45.920]   Well, I have the link in the friend feed room.
[00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:49.360]   You guys are the tools and tips thinkers.
[00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:51.560]   I embedded it somewhere.
[00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:52.720]   Yeah, it is.
[00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:54.520]   It's something I'm going to find it.
[00:25:54.520 --> 00:25:56.560]   If you go to our friend feed room,
[00:25:56.560 --> 00:26:01.680]   twit-twig, which is what I'm doing right now.
[00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:02.720]   Yeah, me too.
[00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:04.000]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   It's faster.
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:06.240]   [GRUNTING]
[00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:07.560]   OK, yeah, yeah.
[00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:10.880]   OK, so the URL is actually kind of complicated.
[00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:12.120]   Long.
[00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:13.120]   It is quite long.
[00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:15.280]   It's probably not a URL we'd want to read on.
[00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:16.480]   And it doesn't say Jeff--
[00:26:16.480 --> 00:26:17.080]   well, it does.
[00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:19.040]   OK, on the right, it says buy Jeff Jarvis.
[00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:19.920]   Now that's guess.
[00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:21.400]   And people can rate it.
[00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:23.680]   And I'm a partner at a company in a piece
[00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:26.000]   of Google News called Daylife.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   And one part of our original plan,
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:32.320]   we didn't start up to have 100 things they want to do,
[00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:34.280]   was to have people do just this, which
[00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:40.760]   is to create whoever created the best David Bowie page.
[00:26:40.760 --> 00:26:42.840]   I don't know why it's in my mind.
[00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:45.520]   [SINGING]
[00:26:45.520 --> 00:26:47.800]   So we come late to the show before the show Leo was--
[00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:51.440]   I was on his Santa Claus hat singing.
[00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:54.360]   But if Gina and I each created a page,
[00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:55.920]   but she creates a better page because she
[00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:59.000]   got the keywords right, then her page should get higher ratings
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.560]   and should rise and becomes a new topic page.
[00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:04.000]   Well, I press the button and it says add this section.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.200]   Where does it add that section?
[00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:05.600]   To mine?
[00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:06.760]   On to your Google News.
[00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:10.680]   So if I go to my Google News page, now I'll say Jeff's--
[00:27:10.680 --> 00:27:12.240]   I think so.
[00:27:12.240 --> 00:27:16.480]   But you're the tools guy.
[00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:17.200]   I'm just looking.
[00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:19.400]   I see now a Google link was that--
[00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:20.360]   yeah, OK.
[00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:20.960]   So it does.
[00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:24.440]   It adds it to my left-hand nav bar.
[00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:27.040]   It doesn't say Jeff Jarvis, but it says what your topic is.
[00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:29.440]   And so now I have a new Google topic.
[00:27:29.440 --> 00:27:30.320]   Oh, interesting.
[00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:30.520]   Yes.
[00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:33.480]   And so now I have actually-- that has made you
[00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:35.000]   one of my editors.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:35.440]   Right.
[00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:36.440]   Exactly.
[00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:39.360]   Well, and you know, I get mine was not fancy.
[00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:40.040]   All I did was Google.
[00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:44.120]   But I think you can do a lot of Boolean fun stuff
[00:27:44.120 --> 00:27:47.920]   to say Google plus Eric Schmidt plus Marissa Meyer, not
[00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:49.360]   Sergey Brann.
[00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:53.160]   So is it a search term that you give it?
[00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:53.680]   What--
[00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:54.960]   Basically.
[00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:58.160]   I mean, Google News has topics that it knows about.
[00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:00.960]   I think that if you went and put in, you know, me,
[00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:03.560]   it wouldn't be as satisfying.
[00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:06.400]   Now, where do I-- I'm on my Google News page.
[00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:09.280]   Where do I go to-- is it in the preferences?
[00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:11.640]   Is it in the advanced search?
[00:28:11.640 --> 00:28:12.760]   Maybe I'm not signed in.
[00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:15.080]   Let me sign in here.
[00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:16.360]   I don't have to sign in.
[00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:19.520]   Well, you know, Google News top right at a section.
[00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:21.920]   Is that it?
[00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:22.640]   Oh, yes.
[00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:23.280]   At a section.
[00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:24.480]   Yeah, if you're signed in, new.
[00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:25.960]   I can create a custom section.
[00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:27.280]   Ta-da!
[00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:28.120]   I don't have that.
[00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:28.840]   I feel like Gina.
[00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:30.520]   I don't have that.
[00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:31.280]   And then you can sign in.
[00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:32.320]   So wait, are you signed in?
[00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:33.240]   I'm signed in.
[00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:33.880]   Top right.
[00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:36.240]   I see web history, Maya kind.
[00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:38.560]   Oh, I'm not in news, probably.
[00:28:38.560 --> 00:28:39.560]   Yeah, go to News.
[00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:39.920]   I'll go to--
[00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:41.040]   I'm still at Jeff's News.
[00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:42.520]   OK, let me go to my News.
[00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:46.120]   On the upper right under the little red, new.
[00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:46.840]   There, I see it.
[00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:47.680]   At a section.
[00:28:47.680 --> 00:28:48.200]   At a section.
[00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:49.200]   Right, so on the right of that--
[00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:49.480]   Right, right of that.
[00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:52.040]   Custom section.
[00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:54.160]   And you can--
[00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:56.400]   I can even do a local section, which is kind of nice.
[00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:57.560]   What's cool is you could also-- yes,
[00:28:57.560 --> 00:29:01.000]   you can do different languages and such.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   And then publish this site to the directory.
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:04.160]   So--
[00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:04.360]   So--
[00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:05.400]   And browse by everybody.
[00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:07.400]   So then-- and now in the directory, as you said,
[00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:09.960]   these are highly rated sections.
[00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:10.840]   Some of them by Google.
[00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:14.480]   But here's one by a guy named Stefan that stories about Google.
[00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:15.320]   It's outranking you.
[00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:16.800]   He's got quite a few users.
[00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:18.360]   Hey.
[00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:19.400]   Most of these are by Google.
[00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:20.880]   That's neat.
[00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:21.320]   And--
[00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:23.080]   Yeah, listen.
[00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:25.600]   I wouldn't necessarily wonder what he did.
[00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:27.960]   What I'm trying to see is, is it transparent what words
[00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:30.200]   he used to make it.
[00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:31.680]   That's a good question, because then you could just
[00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:33.280]   steal his search--
[00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:35.280]   Right, he just steals his search terms.
[00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:38.360]   I just made a Google Wave section.
[00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:41.040]   So if I now search for a section called Wave,
[00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:42.920]   let's see who has Google Wave sections.
[00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:46.920]   There's a few by Sean Brady, Randall, Don, Mark.
[00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:48.200]   So yours will show up in here.
[00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:50.680]   It's still not here, but it'll show up in here.
[00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:52.400]   That's great.
[00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:53.160]   Oh, published it.
[00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:54.840]   It's rather like Twitter lists, in a sense.
[00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:56.840]   But it's just doing the list of the world.
[00:29:56.840 --> 00:30:03.000]   This is a-- as is often the case with Google,
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:06.280]   this is a great tool that they haven't exposed very well.
[00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:08.040]   It's not obvious how to use it.
[00:30:08.040 --> 00:30:13.080]   And if they could take advantage of massive numbers of people
[00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:15.000]   generating this, as massive number of people
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.960]   have used Twitter lists, this could be hugely valuable.
[00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:20.480]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:23.520]   And imagine that if you had experts in various areas,
[00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:26.840]   if you had a financial reporter covering companies using this.
[00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:28.840]   You could put this in your profile, though, say,
[00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:32.280]   read my Google News Google section.
[00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:33.960]   Well, and if Google doesn't think like this,
[00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:35.520]   but of course, I should be able to--
[00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:38.200]   and you can do this with the Daylight API,
[00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:40.640]   but I shouldn't be able to take this and put this on my blog.
[00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:41.320]   Right.
[00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:41.800]   Yeah.
[00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:43.800]   I can create a Google page with Daylight.
[00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:44.840]   That's what I thought you had done.
[00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:46.360]   Lazy and have done it.
[00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:49.800]   But they're thinking, oddly, this is the case where Google's
[00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:51.360]   not thinking that my Google News is not
[00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:52.280]   thinking about exploring them.
[00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:55.880]   I went to Google News, oh, geez.
[00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:59.280]   Six years ago, seven years ago, trying to get them
[00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:01.400]   to export Google News to the news sites I ran.
[00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:02.280]   Right.
[00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:03.040]   It's an all neat idea.
[00:31:03.040 --> 00:31:04.040]   I never did it.
[00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:06.840]   So that's when you got hooked up with Daylife, I guess.
[00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:07.840]   Exactly.
[00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:08.160]   Exactly.
[00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:10.160]   Because it is a great idea.
[00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:12.880]   And Daylife has an API, not to plug it, but it has an API
[00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:14.240]   that enables--
[00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:18.200]   USA Today has 40,000 topic pages created using Daylife.
[00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:20.400]   That pushes their own content first,
[00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:21.760]   and then the content of the rest of the world
[00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:23.400]   plus photos and quotes and that kind of stuff.
[00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:25.760]   So there's some similar functionality here,
[00:31:25.760 --> 00:31:30.440]   but it's API think versus destination think.
[00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:32.880]   Interestingly, I have a Google Alert set up
[00:31:32.880 --> 00:31:35.840]   for this particular news story I was following quite a while ago,
[00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:38.320]   but that's also showing on my Google News page
[00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:39.960]   on the right hand side of the content column.
[00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:41.280]   So your alerts are showing up, too.
[00:31:41.280 --> 00:31:41.720]   That's good.
[00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:42.160]   Yeah.
[00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:43.320]   Yeah, which is what you're saying.
[00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:44.680]   Well, this replaces, in some ways,
[00:31:44.680 --> 00:31:45.800]   an alert functionality.
[00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:46.600]   Like, yes.
[00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:47.040]   Yeah.
[00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:47.560]   It does.
[00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:50.680]   I mean, the good thing about alerts is that it's like--
[00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:52.040]   it'll email you a digest.
[00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:53.840]   So it's like those things that kind of like--
[00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:56.520]   my friend is involved in a case.
[00:31:56.520 --> 00:31:58.520]   And I just like if there's any--
[00:31:58.520 --> 00:31:59.840]   I'm not going to look every day, but I
[00:31:59.840 --> 00:32:01.360]   want to get notified or something happens.
[00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:02.360]   So it's just one kind of way to--
[00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:03.600]   I use it like most people do.
[00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:05.240]   I just put my name--
[00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:05.720]   Right.
[00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:06.880]   --you know, my search terms.
[00:32:06.880 --> 00:32:07.360]   So I know--
[00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:08.360]   Ego Search, yeah.
[00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:09.120]   Yeah, it is an Ego Search.
[00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:11.880]   Now, if I do an RSS of this--
[00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:12.400]   yes.
[00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:15.360]   So I also-- I have all the Ego Searches as RSS,
[00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:16.080]   my RSS reader.
[00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:17.920]   I have an Ego section.
[00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:20.480]   Is there an RSS of your Google News?
[00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:21.000]   Yes.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   There is.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:28.240]   So I have Google News, Techorati, Ice Rocket, Blog Pulse.
[00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:31.240]   Because I'm making news in Germany, Google News, Germany.
[00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:34.160]   And I just go there and revel it myself.
[00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:36.520]   Does this require any work on your part to maintainer?
[00:32:36.520 --> 00:32:38.960]   Is it now just-- it's just a customized search?
[00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:40.360]   That's all it is, really.
[00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:40.800]   Yeah.
[00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:42.720]   But I guess-- you know what you could do, I guess Leo,
[00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:44.880]   is that you could go in and say, I'm
[00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:48.880]   going to do the World Series page.
[00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:53.000]   And as Utley becomes big, you add Utley.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:53.680]   Yeah.
[00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:55.160]   I don't-- yeah.
[00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:56.600]   --some way that you can tune it.
[00:32:56.600 --> 00:32:57.080]   Never.
[00:32:57.080 --> 00:32:59.640]   And be known for having the best World Series page.
[00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:01.160]   Never.
[00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:04.840]   Gina, you're of an age where Sesame Street resonates.
[00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:06.560]   I'm not.
[00:33:06.560 --> 00:33:08.160]   I was 12 on Sesame Street.
[00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:10.080]   And Jeff and I are too old, really.
[00:33:10.080 --> 00:33:10.600]   Yeah.
[00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:11.080]   Yeah.
[00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:12.080]   I definitely grew up on Sesame Street.
[00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:12.920]   But you grew up on--
[00:33:12.920 --> 00:33:14.600]   so and I imagine the Googlers did.
[00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:17.960]   So for you, when-- for the last three days, every time you
[00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:20.640]   went to Google, you'd see a Sesame Street character.
[00:33:20.640 --> 00:33:23.280]   That to you made sense.
[00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:23.780]   Yeah.
[00:33:23.780 --> 00:33:25.200]   I mean, I see Sesame Street characters,
[00:33:25.200 --> 00:33:26.360]   and I just feel warm and fuzzy.
[00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:26.360]   Yeah.
[00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:27.520]   That's what we did.
[00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:28.520]   Yeah.
[00:33:28.520 --> 00:33:29.840]   But it has been for three days.
[00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:30.440]   It's interesting.
[00:33:30.440 --> 00:33:33.840]   I noticed it, but I just-- I didn't look into what or why
[00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:35.080]   or for how long?
[00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:37.280]   In three days is unprecedented.
[00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:38.560]   I can't think any other-- well, no way.
[00:33:38.560 --> 00:33:41.280]   But the crop circle thing went on for a while.
[00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:41.920]   Oh, OK.
[00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:42.440]   OK.
[00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:43.680]   But this is ridiculous.
[00:33:43.680 --> 00:33:47.040]   I mean, I'm not-- no, I'm not knocking Sesame Street.
[00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:49.640]   And I love Sesame Street and blah, blah, blah.
[00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:51.440]   But it's almost a little juvenile.
[00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:56.960]   It's like this was so seminal for people in their 30s.
[00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:57.320]   Right.
[00:33:57.320 --> 00:33:58.440]   Yeah.
[00:33:58.440 --> 00:34:01.640]   Well, it is very sort of generationally specific.
[00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:02.760]   Totally generational.
[00:34:02.760 --> 00:34:06.080]   I mean, I love Oscar the Grouch, but I don't get why people
[00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:07.840]   are going all warm and fuzzy on it.
[00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:08.680]   Yeah.
[00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:11.440]   I mean, honestly, I so rarely visit the home page.
[00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:11.940]   Yeah.
[00:34:11.940 --> 00:34:13.240]   I had some networks from this week,
[00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:15.240]   so I was going to google.com in my browser.
[00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:16.680]   But that was the only reason why.
[00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:18.800]   The only reason I see it is because other people
[00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:19.880]   use these computers here.
[00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:22.680]   So I log them out of their Google account.
[00:34:22.680 --> 00:34:25.360]   And then you get a generic Google page that
[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:27.960]   has a little version of it in there.
[00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:29.360]   I know what the ad is gone.
[00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:30.000]   The ad is gone.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.960]   So it must have just been for day one.
[00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:35.080]   Does anybody know how many page views
[00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:37.920]   that front page gets every day?
[00:34:37.920 --> 00:34:39.760]   It's got to be billions, right?
[00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:40.600]   Yeah.
[00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:41.960]   Well, you know--
[00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:42.560]   Out of me.
[00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:45.960]   I would imagine that the search results page, certainly,
[00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:48.760]   as a group, got a hell of a lot more.
[00:34:48.760 --> 00:34:49.280]   Yeah.
[00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:50.160]   Let's hope.
[00:34:50.160 --> 00:34:52.240]   As a group, but the point is they are a group.
[00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:53.560]   They're a bunch of different.
[00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:54.320]   It's heterogeneous.
[00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:57.000]   This is one page that everybody sees.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.400]   And as you point out, Eric Schmidt said,
[00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:00.960]   this is valuable.
[00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:04.440]   This is the most valuable real estate on the internet, isn't it?
[00:35:04.440 --> 00:35:07.560]   I'm just wondering how many impressions that Droid ad got.
[00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:08.320]   I was just--
[00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:10.040]   I mean, it just-- but it has to be going down, right?
[00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:13.080]   I mean, people are actually moving away from visiting
[00:35:13.080 --> 00:35:14.320]   Google.com, right?
[00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:16.480]   I mean, aren't people-- do you think people are using the search
[00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:16.480]   box?
[00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:17.480]   No, I want you to know.
[00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:21.200]   I want people who are not idiots, go to any site,
[00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:22.440]   not even by using the search.
[00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:24.160]   They go to Google.com first.
[00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:25.600]   Then they type them in the box.
[00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:26.600]   No, no, that's--
[00:35:26.600 --> 00:35:27.600]   No, they're idiots.
[00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:28.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:29.600]   No, I'm sorry.
[00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:30.280]   I'm out there.
[00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:33.680]   No, but I think nowadays, most people, because most browsers--
[00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:37.080]   I think all browsers now have that little Google or that search
[00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:38.840]   box up in the upper right.
[00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:41.400]   Don't you-- in fact, it's frequently
[00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:42.960]   that I won't even type a URL.
[00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:45.560]   I'll type a term in there.
[00:35:45.560 --> 00:35:47.520]   And then I'll get this Google search page,
[00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:49.160]   and I'll click where I wanted to go.
[00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:51.800]   So it's an extra click.
[00:35:51.800 --> 00:35:57.280]   I wish I had a four leaf clover there in the toolbar,
[00:35:57.280 --> 00:35:59.120]   so I could just go lucky from there.
[00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:00.200]   Yeah, wouldn't that be nice?
[00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:00.700]   I'm sure--
[00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:01.500]   I'd be interested.
[00:36:01.500 --> 00:36:03.040]   You can add the Google toolbar.
[00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:03.840]   You'll get-- you add a little--
[00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:04.320]   Yes, that's true.
[00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:05.120]   But who wants that?
[00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:06.280]   I don't want that.
[00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:08.400]   There's one of you in a way to build a custom search that
[00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:09.520]   does the lucky--
[00:36:09.520 --> 00:36:12.840]   I'm going to do that for you, Jeff, after the show.
[00:36:12.840 --> 00:36:15.440]   So it's really easy to make a custom search engine.
[00:36:15.440 --> 00:36:16.200]   Yeah.
[00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:18.040]   Oh, you would make a custom search engine.
[00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:19.280]   Yeah, like, well, I mean--
[00:36:19.280 --> 00:36:20.240]   That's the way to do it.
[00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:20.760]   Yeah.
[00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:21.280]   Yeah.
[00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:22.280]   Just a query for that.
[00:36:22.280 --> 00:36:24.440]   Can you chase the favicon that way, though?
[00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:25.680]   Yeah, you can actually set it.
[00:36:25.680 --> 00:36:26.880]   It's just a little bit of XML.
[00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:30.200]   It's a little bike there, Gina.
[00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:31.680]   Gina's bicycle search.
[00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:32.520]   Or a wave.
[00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:33.640]   Either one could be your logo.
[00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:34.560]   I don't know.
[00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:36.120]   Yeah, you can set the favicon.
[00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:37.440]   At one point, I made one for Life Hacker,
[00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:40.160]   because Life Hacker's internal site search kind of really sucks.
[00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:45.440]   So I tell my reach to Google it to do a site poll in Life Hacker.com.
[00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:46.800]   So yeah, so I'll put together--
[00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:48.800]   I'm sure a lucky search wouldn't be too difficult.
[00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:49.760]   That's cool.
[00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:51.160]   It's not to sound like a boastful program
[00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:52.880]   or that I sound like right now.
[00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:56.720]   Hey, I thought you were going to do it in Firefox extension
[00:36:56.720 --> 00:36:57.560]   or something like that.
[00:36:57.560 --> 00:36:59.440]   I thought you were going to change the Firefox UI.
[00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:01.840]   And that's more impressive, because you
[00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:03.600]   have to use JavaScript for that.
[00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:04.920]   Well, I could do that too, now.
[00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:05.920]   Ah-ha!
[00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:06.880]   I know, I'm just kidding.
[00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:08.120]   Ah-ha!
[00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:10.760]   I'm going to send you a droid just because you deserve it
[00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:12.280]   for that, just for that.
[00:37:12.280 --> 00:37:14.480]   Just because I'm being one of the annoying coders.
[00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:15.840]   Yeah, just because you're an annoying coder.
[00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:16.320]   You deserve a droid.
[00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:17.760]   No, it all coders.
[00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:19.040]   You deserve a droid.
[00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:21.520]   What is the Google Data Liberation Front?
[00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:27.360]   It sounds very lefty, but I don't think it really is.
[00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:31.240]   You know, I discovered this through your tool of the week,
[00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:32.520]   which you'll talk about later.
[00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:34.480]   But it was kind of-- they mentioned it kind of offhand
[00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:37.120]   in the announcement that they had founded this data
[00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:39.000]   liberation group, which I hadn't seen before.
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:40.440]   So I don't know if either of you guys have heard of it.
[00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:40.960]   I did.
[00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:42.400]   And I forgot to mention it a couple of weeks ago.
[00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:45.400]   You better talk about it, as their defense against those
[00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:46.520]   who say, I can't leave you.
[00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:47.800]   And he says, yes, you can.
[00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:48.320]   Yeah.
[00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:50.760]   So I mean, it's a group of engineers inside Google
[00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:54.200]   whose purpose is to figure out or encourage
[00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:57.200]   the different Google products, encourage
[00:37:57.200 --> 00:37:59.600]   ways to export your data and to get your data out, right?
[00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:00.760]   I just love this.
[00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:01.280]   I love this.
[00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:02.280]   I love this.
[00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:03.800]   You should be able-- you need an escape hatch.
[00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:06.160]   You should be able to come and go as you please.
[00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:08.160]   We don't want to make it difficult to get your data out.
[00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:10.600]   So this task force exists within Google
[00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:13.640]   to, quote unquote, liberate products.
[00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:16.200]   And so if you go-- so now I figure out what the URL there is.
[00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:18.360]   If you go to the site--
[00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:20.280]   Dataliberation.org.
[00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:24.240]   And it's a very sort of interesting kind of design.
[00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:25.840]   And it seems like a very political--
[00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:26.320]   It does.
[00:38:26.320 --> 00:38:29.640]   It's got a fist, a raised fist in red.
[00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:35.280]   And the fingers of the fist are 1010, which I like.
[00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:36.760]   It's like very binary.
[00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:37.280]   Yeah.
[00:38:37.280 --> 00:38:38.800]   Yeah.
[00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:41.520]   And so they have a list there of all Google products
[00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:43.400]   and the ways in which you can export your data.
[00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:44.400]   It's fantastic.
[00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:49.520]   Do you think it's P-R or you think this is genuine?
[00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:50.320]   I think it's both.
[00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:52.600]   I think that Google is an organization made up
[00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:53.840]   of primarily engineers.
[00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:55.960]   And I think that data portability and the ability
[00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:58.840]   to export and get your data out is very important to the kind
[00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:01.040]   of engineer that Google attracts.
[00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:01.880]   I do.
[00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:02.760]   I do believe that.
[00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:04.000]   But I also do think it's PR.
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:05.880]   I mean, I think that Google knows that people are starting
[00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:08.760]   to get a little more and more freaked out about the fact
[00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:10.480]   that they have your email.
[00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:11.560]   They have your voicemail.
[00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:13.600]   They have your-- your R-S has reading habits.
[00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:14.720]   They have your search terms.
[00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:17.560]   And that if Google wanted-- let's be honest.
[00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:20.120]   If Google wanted-- if you're a heavy Google user,
[00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:22.840]   they could build a very, very complete profile of who
[00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:24.880]   you are as a person.
[00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:26.640]   So I think people have fears about that.
[00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:28.120]   And I think that this is Google's way.
[00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:29.320]   This is also a PR move.
[00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:29.880]   This is a way.
[00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:30.400]   OK.
[00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:30.920]   I think you're right.
[00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:32.840]   I think it's even on antitrust.
[00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:35.960]   I've seen Eric Schmidt at the Aspen Ideas Festival, Brian
[00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:38.560]   Lehrer from the NPR station here in New York,
[00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:40.440]   said, aren't you too big?
[00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:43.720]   Basic standard question, shouldn't you be regulated?
[00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:45.320]   And I can't leave you.
[00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:48.040]   And Schmidt said, yes, you can.
[00:39:48.040 --> 00:39:49.880]   For every single Google function there is,
[00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:52.560]   there is a perfectly good alternative.
[00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:55.120]   And so trying to accuse Google of monopoly
[00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:57.280]   becomes difficult then if they say, not only
[00:39:57.280 --> 00:39:59.520]   is there alternative, we will make it very easy for you
[00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:01.880]   to leave us and go to that alternative.
[00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:02.720]   Right.
[00:40:02.720 --> 00:40:05.040]   So it's not-- you can't tell whether it was the idea,
[00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:06.880]   it was the engineers.
[00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:11.400]   There was with the engineers first or was with the management
[00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:12.160]   first, but it serves--
[00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:14.920]   I have the impression it was engineers first, but--
[00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:15.640]   It serves two purposes.
[00:40:15.640 --> 00:40:17.120]   This is part of the principle of the company
[00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:18.640]   and they know they have to hold to it.
[00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:19.240]   Good.
[00:40:19.240 --> 00:40:20.040]   Right on.
[00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:21.480]   I mean, I think that's very important.
[00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:22.080]   I agree.
[00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:25.160]   It is extremely important to their users.
[00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:27.520]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:28.720]   Facebook doesn't have that.
[00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:35.000]   I know.
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:35.520]   I know.
[00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:36.040]   I know.
[00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:38.160]   Twitter doesn't have that either.
[00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:40.480]   Facebook couldn't be more unapologetic about wanting
[00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:41.480]   to keep you inside.
[00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:42.600]   I know.
[00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:46.000]   Can you use RSS or some other method
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.840]   to export your tweets to--
[00:40:48.840 --> 00:40:51.000]   there's ways to save your tweets.
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:52.520]   Yeah, there are very easy ways.
[00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:53.680]   For the API or--
[00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:55.000]   For the API, yeah, yeah.
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:57.520]   I mean, it's all totally exposed.
[00:40:57.520 --> 00:41:00.120]   It's pretty simple to do.
[00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:02.360]   The only-- with one caveat is that you can only go back
[00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:04.960]   like 3,200 tweets and it's a scaling--
[00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:07.320]   I think it's more of a scaling thing than anything else is.
[00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:09.160]   They don't want to have to save everything.
[00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:09.680]   Right.
[00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:12.080]   And well, they don't want to have everything on there.
[00:41:12.080 --> 00:41:13.640]   I think they have these front end servers,
[00:41:13.640 --> 00:41:15.840]   which have helped you search the most recent tweets.
[00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:20.120]   But I think they archive the old stuff on other servers
[00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:22.200]   and they have an expose on the front end yet.
[00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:23.720]   But I talked to Alex Payne about it
[00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:25.800]   because I was a developer at Twitter
[00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:28.000]   and he said that exporting all your tweets
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.160]   is on the roadmap and then they're working on it.
[00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:31.840]   The other question I have, I was trying to search
[00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:32.760]   this morning for a tweet.
[00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:34.760]   I was writing a post about this woman
[00:41:34.760 --> 00:41:37.560]   who wrote about her miscarriage and it was happening
[00:41:37.560 --> 00:41:38.960]   and it became very controversial.
[00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:40.800]   I wanted to go back to the conversations.
[00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:41.960]   I know there were tons of them,
[00:41:41.960 --> 00:41:45.480]   but search seems to go back about 12 hours.
[00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:46.560]   Yeah, search does not go--
[00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:49.240]   search is not every tweet ever.
[00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:51.040]   It's only recent stuff.
[00:41:51.040 --> 00:41:51.840]   Very recent.
[00:41:51.840 --> 00:41:52.640]   That's not so useful.
[00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:53.160]   Yeah.
[00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:54.880]   That's so useful.
[00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:56.200]   But that's a scaling problem too.
[00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:58.600]   I'm sure I would like to do more.
[00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:00.560]   Yeah, it definitely is.
[00:42:00.560 --> 00:42:04.160]   I mean, Twitter has saddled with its bad decisions early on
[00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:06.800]   as to data structure.
[00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:10.560]   But that's where I complained about the new list function
[00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:11.640]   that was difficult to use.
[00:42:11.640 --> 00:42:14.080]   And Fred Wilson, who invested in Twitter,
[00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:17.160]   answered on Twitter that that's what the APIs for,
[00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:18.560]   that's what developers are for.
[00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:20.440]   Somebody will solve that elsewhere.
[00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:22.840]   Well, and then that's one thing they've done extraordinarily
[00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:24.680]   well and it's been one of the reasons
[00:42:24.680 --> 00:42:26.320]   they've been so successful.
[00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:28.240]   Well, I was at this four-square conference
[00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:33.440]   and Bizstone was there and Reid Hoffman
[00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:35.040]   and Chad Hurley were up there.
[00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:36.800]   And again, it's off the record, but I'm not giving away
[00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:37.880]   anything here.
[00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:41.840]   And they were asked, well, what would be the ideal company
[00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:44.800]   for you to go to get a distribution deal?
[00:42:44.800 --> 00:42:47.320]   They looked at them like they were confused German shepherds,
[00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:48.760]   told me their heads and say, what?
[00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:49.520]   Distribution deal?
[00:42:49.520 --> 00:42:50.400]   Why would we want that?
[00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:51.440]   We have our people.
[00:42:51.440 --> 00:42:52.240]   We have our people.
[00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:52.440]   Right?
[00:42:52.440 --> 00:42:53.440]   We have our users.
[00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:55.440]   The thought is just so different.
[00:42:55.440 --> 00:42:55.800]   Isn't that funny?
[00:42:55.800 --> 00:42:57.120]   Now a big old companies operate.
[00:42:57.120 --> 00:42:58.280]   Yeah.
[00:42:58.280 --> 00:42:59.640]   It's so funny.
[00:42:59.640 --> 00:43:01.960]   Yeah, Twitter does an amazing job of putting developers first
[00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:02.960]   and expose it.
[00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:05.400]   They expose their API often before users get it on their own site.
[00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:09.160]   They're doing that right now with a location and retweeting, right?
[00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:09.520]   That's not--
[00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:09.880]   Retweeting?
[00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:10.360]   Yeah.
[00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:11.320]   Yeah, that's not right.
[00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:14.120]   That's out on the API first.
[00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:15.200]   It's really amazing.
[00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:16.840]   The degree of openness is amazing.
[00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:19.440]   And the fact that they're just not worried,
[00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:20.840]   they just don't seem worried that anyone's
[00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:23.160]   going to build something that's better.
[00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:25.480]   Well, that's because they have a lot of money.
[00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:26.080]   Well, yeah.
[00:43:26.080 --> 00:43:28.360]   Well, it's also G and I think that that is their means
[00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:28.960]   of distribution.
[00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:31.600]   That's what's going to make them world dominant.
[00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:32.680]   Is that network?
[00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:34.640]   Is that-- the other thing that struck me at 4 Square
[00:43:34.640 --> 00:43:36.760]   was that these kinds of guys were not
[00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:39.520]   talking about corporations and industries and conglomerates.
[00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:41.760]   They all use the word ecosystem.
[00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:44.160]   They all recognize that they're a member of something bigger
[00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:46.360]   rather than the owner of their world.
[00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:48.480]   And so I think Twitter has been brilliant about that.
[00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:49.800]   And they have very few staff members.
[00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:50.600]   They're already huge.
[00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:54.080]   And they're going to get gigantic by thinking that way.
[00:43:54.080 --> 00:43:55.600]   Yes.
[00:43:55.600 --> 00:43:56.640]   Add question on this.
[00:43:56.640 --> 00:43:59.480]   We were going to talk on Twitter lists last week and got
[00:43:59.480 --> 00:43:59.920]   short.
[00:43:59.920 --> 00:44:04.400]   But I was having a lunchtime discussion with Sun Jake today.
[00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:06.160]   And he was saying, I don't really
[00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:09.560]   see what the big deal is about lists.
[00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:10.640]   About lists?
[00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:11.680]   Lists, really.
[00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:13.960]   And I take this point because I was
[00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:17.640]   doing the automatic echo chamber reflexive.
[00:44:17.640 --> 00:44:19.000]   It's a big thing.
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:22.400]   And yeah, I mean, I looked at a bunch of lists,
[00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:25.680]   and most of them have zero users.
[00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:28.400]   I would prefer to have tags.
[00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:33.240]   I prefer to have people, as you do on Flickr, congregate around
[00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:35.800]   a word like funny or description of things,
[00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:38.560]   where it becomes useful to more.
[00:44:38.560 --> 00:44:40.880]   Or even the Google News thing, where people can rate it
[00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:44.600]   and publish it and people gather around.
[00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:46.760]   Problem with lists is, as Jake said,
[00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:50.040]   you're going to see 100 exactly the same lists
[00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:52.080]   for the World Series.
[00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:54.520]   That's a good point.
[00:44:54.520 --> 00:44:57.000]   So how would a tag--
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:59.600]   I mean, first of all, a list could be a tag.
[00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:02.800]   That's just exposing it that way, as opposed to--
[00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:05.400]   But you can't call less than Leo, right?
[00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:08.120]   The three of us could start lists.
[00:45:08.120 --> 00:45:11.240]   Because of a taxonomy issue, it's a focus on me,
[00:45:11.240 --> 00:45:12.640]   so you can't agree.
[00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:15.840]   But World Series, probably people would agree on.
[00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:18.400]   I don't know whether the API would enable you to then find, oh,
[00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:20.800]   my god, 100 people made World Series lists.
[00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:23.760]   Here they are, and then somehow get to some kind of ranking--
[00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:24.920]   This is the database issue.
[00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:27.440]   I mean, in effect by having people create lists,
[00:45:27.440 --> 00:45:29.760]   you're having them tag people.
[00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:32.400]   It's just kind of an upside down way of tagging.
[00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:35.440]   I don't see any reason why you couldn't expose it that way.
[00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:37.160]   I think that's what makes it useful, though.
[00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:40.120]   Because then I don't care whether it has a bunch of users.
[00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:45.200]   If you had dumb as a list title, and everybody
[00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:48.160]   started people that don't liken to dumb,
[00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:49.800]   and we find out who's the dumbest then, who's
[00:45:49.800 --> 00:45:51.160]   on the most dumb list.
[00:45:51.160 --> 00:45:52.520]   That'd be fun.
[00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:55.560]   What's interesting is that very quickly, the third party
[00:45:55.560 --> 00:45:57.440]   clients have started TweetDeck.
[00:45:57.440 --> 00:45:59.120]   Cismic is now supporting lists.
[00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:03.880]   And Brisley, I hope you got your Brisley invite, Jeff.
[00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:05.000]   Yes, thank you very much.
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:06.520]   Now has converted its groups.
[00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:08.720]   It had groups before into lists.
[00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:10.160]   So you can see the lists.
[00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:11.080]   You can create lists.
[00:46:11.080 --> 00:46:12.840]   You can modify lists.
[00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:14.880]   You can subscribe to lists.
[00:46:14.880 --> 00:46:17.000]   I haven't done my TweetDeck update yet.
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:19.480]   So they baked lists into the TweetDeck--
[00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:20.960]   Ah, I'm sorry.
[00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:21.680]   I apologize.
[00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:23.760]   It's not available yet, but they've said they would.
[00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:25.000]   They said that they're going to do it.
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:26.840]   But the thing about lists is that so many of the more
[00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:30.600]   advanced clients had group feature, right?
[00:46:30.600 --> 00:46:33.120]   So it was almost like Twitter catching up to them,
[00:46:33.120 --> 00:46:35.800]   and then it was just about the clients saying, oh, well, OK.
[00:46:35.800 --> 00:46:37.360]   Well, guess we'll use the list.
[00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:41.800]   As is often the case with Twitter is that it follows the users.
[00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:44.400]   It follows the community, like with retweets.
[00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:45.320]   And @Signs.
[00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:48.080]   And most of the functionality of Twitter, frankly.
[00:46:48.080 --> 00:46:50.600]   It's true.
[00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:55.880]   And they subtract stuff, but the stuff they add tends to be by.
[00:46:55.880 --> 00:46:58.960]   So I think Brisley's done a good job of not only taking this API,
[00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:00.240]   but making it more useful.
[00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:04.320]   They've got delete buttons and per individual delete buttons.
[00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:06.280]   They've got--
[00:47:06.280 --> 00:47:08.640]   But I think this is pretty close to tagging, Jeff.
[00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:10.560]   I think that this is just another way of doing it.
[00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:11.480]   It's convenient.
[00:47:11.480 --> 00:47:12.560]   Use the API correctly.
[00:47:12.560 --> 00:47:13.080]   I agree.
[00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:14.920]   I think that's where the utility really comes in.
[00:47:14.920 --> 00:47:15.600]   I agree with it.
[00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:16.520]   And it's a focus on me.
[00:47:16.520 --> 00:47:18.720]   So we might spell--
[00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:20.040]   I might have a geek list.
[00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:22.240]   And you might have a tech list that say the same thing.
[00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:24.920]   And I've noticed people like you, the smart people like Jay
[00:47:24.920 --> 00:47:28.800]   Rosen, have very interesting list names.
[00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:29.440]   I just have one--
[00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:30.600]   That goes against the taxonomy.
[00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:31.080]   I know.
[00:47:31.080 --> 00:47:32.640]   And that's what I--
[00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:36.880]   Mindless names are photographers, politicians, science.
[00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:37.320]   Yeah.
[00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:38.560]   And his mindcasters.
[00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:39.120]   So--
[00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:40.120]   Yeah.
[00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:42.600]   I also tried to get a little clever with my list names
[00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:45.080]   just to make them unique.
[00:47:45.080 --> 00:47:47.040]   Maybe that's not the right way to go.
[00:47:47.040 --> 00:47:48.880]   It's probably not the right way to go, right?
[00:47:48.880 --> 00:47:51.400]   It's more useful if we can all agree in a vocabulary.
[00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:53.960]   And I do-- my tech list, presumably people
[00:47:53.960 --> 00:47:56.520]   will know that OLAO is a guy that you would look to see
[00:47:56.520 --> 00:48:00.360]   who he's following in tech, has 485 subscribers.
[00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:03.000]   I mean, people are 300 on my tech TV list,
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:04.880]   and my Twitch list, 374.
[00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:08.600]   So people are using those lists, I think.
[00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:10.280]   It's a better follow Friday.
[00:48:10.280 --> 00:48:11.240]   It's a better follow Friday.
[00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:13.440]   It's a better SUL.
[00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:14.800]   But one difference though, Gina--
[00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:18.840]   Chris Brogan was arguing that he didn't like the list.
[00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:23.000]   But he was also, I think, saying that lists are necessarily
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:23.840]   a recommendation.
[00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:25.000]   And I said, no, not at all, because you
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:26.440]   can have a list of idiots.
[00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:26.920]   You can.
[00:48:26.920 --> 00:48:27.400]   That's what--
[00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:27.400]   That's what--
[00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:28.240]   You can have a list of spammers.
[00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:30.320]   Like, these are people who try to pitch me products constantly.
[00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:30.320]   Right.
[00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:33.160]   So fall Friday is, I think, inherently a recommendation
[00:48:33.160 --> 00:48:34.240]   where lists don't have to be.
[00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:36.040]   Lists are what you wanted.
[00:48:36.040 --> 00:48:37.600]   They're a taxonomy.
[00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:39.560]   I think so if we can get at that.
[00:48:39.560 --> 00:48:41.760]   Right.
[00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:43.160]   Well, I think that-- well, OK.
[00:48:43.160 --> 00:48:45.120]   Listen up, Twitter.
[00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:46.160]   That's what we want.
[00:48:46.160 --> 00:48:47.440]   And I think you're exactly right.
[00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:48.640]   I think you and Jacob are exactly right.
[00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:52.280]   That what we really want is tags.
[00:48:52.280 --> 00:48:53.480]   Well, the other thing Jake said--
[00:48:53.480 --> 00:48:57.400]   and I again couldn't answer him, but that's life--
[00:48:57.400 --> 00:48:57.920]   was he said--
[00:48:57.920 --> 00:48:59.520]   At least you're talking about these things.
[00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:00.400]   I talk with my son.
[00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:03.000]   I say why you shouldn't be smoking.
[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:05.480]   So you're way ahead of me.
[00:49:05.480 --> 00:49:07.320]   It gives us opportunity for conversation.
[00:49:07.320 --> 00:49:07.600]   Yeah.
[00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:09.200]   It's a good thing.
[00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:12.200]   But he said, why the hashtag?
[00:49:12.200 --> 00:49:13.680]   Why not just the word?
[00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:16.000]   And I fumbled and tried to answer it and said, well,
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:18.120]   if fail hashtag is different from fail in a sentence,
[00:49:18.120 --> 00:49:19.800]   but he said a lot about it.
[00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:20.240]   No, you shouldn't.
[00:49:20.240 --> 00:49:21.640]   No, he's right about that.
[00:49:21.640 --> 00:49:23.520]   In fact, Steve Gilmore for a long time
[00:49:23.520 --> 00:49:25.040]   was trying to deprecate the @ sign.
[00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:26.240]   So what do you need that sign for?
[00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:29.760]   A good search eliminates the need for hash or @
[00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:30.600]   or any of that stuff.
[00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:31.600]   It's just search.
[00:49:31.600 --> 00:49:33.280]   There is an intent to that.
[00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:33.640]   Yeah.
[00:49:33.640 --> 00:49:35.320]   There's an intent to the app that says,
[00:49:35.320 --> 00:49:36.760]   this is really about this person.
[00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:38.160]   There's some functionality.
[00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:39.480]   But you can duplicate a lot of that
[00:49:39.480 --> 00:49:41.600]   with appropriate tracking and searching.
[00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:43.040]   Yeah.
[00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:45.400]   And I think there's an intent to the pound sign,
[00:49:45.400 --> 00:49:46.440]   to the hash sign.
[00:49:46.440 --> 00:49:50.680]   You're saying this word is more than just a word in a search.
[00:49:50.680 --> 00:49:53.480]   This is taxonomy.
[00:49:53.480 --> 00:49:55.000]   I like tagging.
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:57.760]   I think tagging is very powerful.
[00:49:57.760 --> 00:50:01.120]   I don't like that hashtags have started to spread
[00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:06.120]   onto other sites where there isn't the 140 character limit.
[00:50:06.120 --> 00:50:07.480]   Have you guys seen that?
[00:50:07.480 --> 00:50:08.640]   I actually probably shouldn't complain.
[00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:10.880]   I'm probably going to get in trouble with my colleagues
[00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:14.280]   at Ecker and at Life Hacker because we're now using--
[00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:16.800]   Life Hacker is now using hashtags to tag posts.
[00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:19.760]   And it just doesn't make sense to me.
[00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:20.240]   Why not?
[00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:23.120]   Because word presses had tagging for a long time.
[00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:24.760]   Almost all blog platforms have tagging.
[00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:26.040]   I think tags are great.
[00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:27.120]   I think putting the hash mark--
[00:50:27.120 --> 00:50:28.040]   Putting a hash mark there.
[00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:29.640]   Doesn't make sense because you're not
[00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:32.120]   limited to 140 characters.
[00:50:32.120 --> 00:50:36.120]   But it seems to be kind of this new fangled Twitter thing
[00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:38.040]   to do so people are doing it in other mediums.
[00:50:38.040 --> 00:50:39.880]   I think it works well on Twitter.
[00:50:39.880 --> 00:50:40.520]   I think tags.
[00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:42.120]   I love tags across the board.
[00:50:42.120 --> 00:50:43.040]   Delicious.
[00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:43.760]   I'm all about tags.
[00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:47.960]   And it's the hash mark that seems unnecessary in other contexts.
[00:50:47.960 --> 00:50:48.320]   It's just--
[00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:49.600]   You know, not that you mentioned Leo.
[00:50:49.600 --> 00:50:51.440]   I think you're right about the intent of the hashtag
[00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:52.560]   is that the problem with Twitter,
[00:50:52.560 --> 00:50:54.920]   I was on Dave Weiner and Jay Rosen's
[00:50:54.920 --> 00:50:56.960]   rebooting the news podcast a week ago.
[00:50:56.960 --> 00:50:58.400]   Not should be just oil.
[00:50:58.400 --> 00:50:58.920]   No.
[00:50:58.920 --> 00:51:00.320]   No, in fact, I want to get them on our show.
[00:51:00.320 --> 00:51:00.680]   I think they are.
[00:51:00.680 --> 00:51:01.280]   Yeah, we absolutely.
[00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:02.600]   They're on my list.
[00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:05.040]   But as a guest-- and so we talked about--
[00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:09.040]   I wish there were also taxonomy for what
[00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:12.840]   does this hashtag mean, what conference are you at?
[00:51:12.840 --> 00:51:13.520]   Right.
[00:51:13.520 --> 00:51:14.520]   That's where it started.
[00:51:14.520 --> 00:51:15.400]   So I said, why not?
[00:51:15.400 --> 00:51:17.480]   I think we talked about this more defined hashtag.
[00:51:17.480 --> 00:51:18.480]   And Dave said, yeah, I agree.
[00:51:18.480 --> 00:51:19.960]   And he tried to suggest that.
[00:51:19.960 --> 00:51:22.280]   But you can't do it on Twitter.
[00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:25.000]   That led me to a post where I said that I love Twitter,
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:26.840]   but it's causing me problems in memory
[00:51:26.840 --> 00:51:29.880]   because I'm logging less.
[00:51:29.880 --> 00:51:31.360]   I'm storing things in the blog less.
[00:51:31.360 --> 00:51:33.880]   When I link to something on Twitter, it goes away.
[00:51:33.880 --> 00:51:36.840]   And the other problem is that it's a really bad place
[00:51:36.840 --> 00:51:39.440]   in the end to get a good critical mask going.
[00:51:39.440 --> 00:51:41.640]   Because the half-life of a meme on Twitter
[00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:42.840]   is sometimes 30 seconds.
[00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:43.680]   Right.
[00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:44.200]   Yeah.
[00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:45.920]   Maybe 24 hours max.
[00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:48.280]   Whereas on a blog, the notion of the Permalink--
[00:51:48.280 --> 00:51:51.880]   and I think it's more fundamental of the whole internet--
[00:51:51.880 --> 00:51:55.360]   that an SEO Permalink world, which we had in the page-based
[00:51:55.360 --> 00:51:57.200]   internet, what we're seeing with Twitter
[00:51:57.200 --> 00:51:59.280]   is the future that's going to go off.
[00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:00.240]   And everything is fleeting.
[00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:02.040]   Everything goes away.
[00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:03.880]   And you can't gather around.
[00:52:03.880 --> 00:52:05.840]   If you don't gather around real fast, forget it.
[00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:06.760]   It's over, bub.
[00:52:06.760 --> 00:52:11.120]   Those swarms, those attention swarms really move on.
[00:52:11.120 --> 00:52:11.800]   That's the nature.
[00:52:11.800 --> 00:52:14.480]   That's the short attention span nature of Twitter.
[00:52:14.480 --> 00:52:16.440]   Yes.
[00:52:16.440 --> 00:52:17.000]   And more of a huge--
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:18.200]   This is why it's so important for us
[00:52:18.200 --> 00:52:19.840]   to have our tweets on our own servers,
[00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:22.000]   and include them in our blog posts, and link to them,
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:24.640]   and that kind of thing.
[00:52:24.640 --> 00:52:26.720]   The difference you're storing a bookmark on Twitter
[00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:28.600]   and delicious is that you're going to broadcast it more
[00:52:28.600 --> 00:52:30.480]   easily, and it's probably more people on Twitter.
[00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:33.520]   But it's not going to be archived the way that it is on.
[00:52:33.520 --> 00:52:36.920]   I mean, that's just kind of the nature of different media.
[00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:41.280]   Some media are short-term, some are long-term,
[00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:43.960]   and a blog is a long-term post to--
[00:52:43.960 --> 00:52:45.320]   But our presumption about things-- right,
[00:52:45.320 --> 00:52:46.480]   that was TV and radio, right?
[00:52:46.480 --> 00:52:48.240]   When you did radio, it went off into the airwaves,
[00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:50.440]   and they're listening to it somewhere in another galaxy now,
[00:52:50.440 --> 00:52:51.480]   right?
[00:52:51.480 --> 00:52:54.680]   Whereas once the notion of the Permalink came,
[00:52:54.680 --> 00:52:56.640]   and the ethic of the Permalink came--
[00:52:56.640 --> 00:52:58.720]   it was Nick Denton who first taught me about it
[00:52:58.720 --> 00:53:00.200]   and said, "Don Jarvis, you did the wrong thing.
[00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:01.600]   You should have done this and that,"
[00:53:01.600 --> 00:53:02.920]   linked to here and there.
[00:53:02.920 --> 00:53:04.560]   He taught me what it meant.
[00:53:04.560 --> 00:53:06.320]   I think that's changed my perception
[00:53:06.320 --> 00:53:09.520]   about what I-- my expectation about information,
[00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:12.000]   that it's an ethical thing to get back at it.
[00:53:12.000 --> 00:53:13.920]   And when things go off in the ether,
[00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:15.880]   I'm feeling like it's lost now.
[00:53:15.880 --> 00:53:18.080]   You want Brewster Cale to start the time machine
[00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:20.000]   for the streamed web, not just the paper?
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:21.000]   Right, right.
[00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:21.880]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:53:21.880 --> 00:53:23.440]   You hit the nail on the head, I'm just used to it
[00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:26.000]   because that's the kind of media I do.
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:28.200]   In fact, I prefer because if I say something stupid,
[00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:28.720]   at least it doesn't--
[00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:30.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:33.360]   It doesn't stick around to haunt me.
[00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:34.400]   You're right stuffed down.
[00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:37.960]   People have this nasty tendency of bringing it back up.
[00:53:37.960 --> 00:53:38.960]   I can always deny it.
[00:53:38.960 --> 00:53:40.160]   I have high deniability.
[00:53:40.160 --> 00:53:41.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:53:41.600 --> 00:53:42.120]   Let's just--
[00:53:42.120 --> 00:53:44.400]   Was just singing of Christmas carols before recorded
[00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:45.480]   anywhere, Leo?
[00:53:45.480 --> 00:53:46.880]   I don't know what you're talking about.
[00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:48.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:53:48.200 --> 00:53:48.880]   It never happened.
[00:53:48.880 --> 00:53:49.680]   Never happened.
[00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:50.480]   It's gone.
[00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:52.040]   No, unfortunately, we record everything.
[00:53:52.040 --> 00:53:53.480]   I've got an array of hard drives
[00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:55.920]   and everything is permanent now.
[00:53:55.920 --> 00:53:58.120]   But I control the permanency.
[00:53:58.120 --> 00:54:01.320]   Hey, let's get to our tool, our tip,
[00:54:01.320 --> 00:54:04.800]   and our number of the week starting with Gina Trapani
[00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:09.680]   and her tip of the week.
[00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:13.320]   So my tip this week is a little cheat sheet.
[00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:14.480]   I love this.
[00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:15.600]   A Google voice.
[00:54:15.600 --> 00:54:17.560]   Yeah, so Google Voice, people are getting invites
[00:54:17.560 --> 00:54:19.840]   and sending out invites and more people are trying it out.
[00:54:19.840 --> 00:54:21.920]   And Google Voice is fantastic, but I tell you,
[00:54:21.920 --> 00:54:24.760]   I really could write a complete guide to Google Voice as well.
[00:54:24.760 --> 00:54:26.760]   It's got a lot of different options.
[00:54:26.760 --> 00:54:30.120]   And when you call and you get a press this to do this
[00:54:30.120 --> 00:54:32.200]   and to do that, you can do all sorts of cool things with it.
[00:54:32.200 --> 00:54:33.560]   But sometimes it's hard to remember
[00:54:33.560 --> 00:54:34.960]   what you're supposed to press when.
[00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:40.280]   And so this very cool, I think, designer at coolgeeks.com
[00:54:40.280 --> 00:54:42.960]   created a Google Voice quick reference guide, which
[00:54:42.960 --> 00:54:46.600]   is just a graphic that you can use to just a reference
[00:54:46.600 --> 00:54:49.400]   for the decision tree when you go in a Google Voice,
[00:54:49.400 --> 00:54:51.240]   when you check your voicemail, when you want to make a call.
[00:54:51.240 --> 00:54:55.600]   And I don't think that he or she mentioned this in the post.
[00:54:55.600 --> 00:54:57.960]   But one thing you could do is take this reference guide.
[00:54:57.960 --> 00:55:01.400]   It's just an image and set it as the wallpaper to your phone.
[00:55:01.400 --> 00:55:03.400]   Oh.
[00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:04.800]   Yeah, I didn't actually try that out.
[00:55:04.800 --> 00:55:06.920]   But it looks like about the right size.
[00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:07.720]   How do you write?
[00:55:07.720 --> 00:55:09.360]   Yeah, if you've got a phone that has wallpaper
[00:55:09.360 --> 00:55:10.840]   and you're just starting to use Google Voice,
[00:55:10.840 --> 00:55:12.440]   it could be a good way to--
[00:55:12.440 --> 00:55:14.560]   you have to glance at your phone and then do what--
[00:55:14.560 --> 00:55:15.760]   if you've got icons in front of it,
[00:55:15.760 --> 00:55:18.200]   it might be a little tricky, but one way to do it.
[00:55:18.200 --> 00:55:20.120]   Or if you just want to print it out and have it on your desk
[00:55:20.120 --> 00:55:22.800]   while you sort of get used to Google Voice, I don't--
[00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:24.760]   I love Google Voice and I use it all the time.
[00:55:24.760 --> 00:55:26.160]   It's my primary number.
[00:55:26.160 --> 00:55:27.760]   But I don't use a lot of the functions.
[00:55:27.760 --> 00:55:29.080]   I use it in a very specific way.
[00:55:29.080 --> 00:55:31.720]   So as you're exploring and figuring out how it works for you,
[00:55:31.720 --> 00:55:33.840]   this quick reference card is good.
[00:55:33.840 --> 00:55:34.760]   It's nicely designed.
[00:55:34.760 --> 00:55:36.160]   It's colorful.
[00:55:36.160 --> 00:55:37.920]   Yeah, if Apple had done Google Voice,
[00:55:37.920 --> 00:55:39.280]   do you think you'd even need this?
[00:55:39.280 --> 00:55:40.800]   Did you find a way around this?
[00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:41.800]   Yeah.
[00:55:41.800 --> 00:55:43.760]   It's so interesting.
[00:55:43.760 --> 00:55:48.480]   Lars Rasmussen, the wave lead, said, wave is complex on purpose.
[00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:50.160]   We weren't shooting to build something
[00:55:50.160 --> 00:55:51.720]   that people can understand in a day.
[00:55:51.720 --> 00:55:53.080]   There's a learning curve, and that's--
[00:55:53.080 --> 00:55:53.920]   we're on apologetic.
[00:55:53.920 --> 00:55:56.600]   Basically, he was saying, we're on apologetic about that.
[00:55:56.600 --> 00:55:58.400]   And in a way, I kind of really like that.
[00:55:58.400 --> 00:56:02.240]   But it really is completely opposite to Apple's ethos,
[00:56:02.240 --> 00:56:04.800]   which is like make it as simple and want to click as possible.
[00:56:04.800 --> 00:56:06.920]   So no, if Apple built Google Voice,
[00:56:06.920 --> 00:56:09.600]   you would not need a quick reference card.
[00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:10.920]   There does come a time, though.
[00:56:10.920 --> 00:56:12.160]   You have to have this stuff, either.
[00:56:12.160 --> 00:56:12.800]   So--
[00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:14.520]   There does come a time, though, when
[00:56:14.520 --> 00:56:16.240]   you have to be complex to be useful.
[00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:18.520]   I mean, if you limit yourself only the things that
[00:56:18.520 --> 00:56:20.480]   don't need a reference card, pretty soon
[00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:22.800]   you only do trivial things, right?
[00:56:22.800 --> 00:56:27.160]   Right, but Google itself, the simplicity of one box
[00:56:27.160 --> 00:56:31.440]   giving you the entire world is complexity
[00:56:31.440 --> 00:56:34.840]   brought to simplicity in a really elegant, profound way.
[00:56:34.840 --> 00:56:38.120]   But-- and search and the web lend themselves to that.
[00:56:38.120 --> 00:56:39.480]   But I don't know if everything does.
[00:56:39.480 --> 00:56:40.680]   No, OK, that's fair.
[00:56:40.680 --> 00:56:42.640]   I think Google loses something with simplicity.
[00:56:42.640 --> 00:56:45.320]   Gina, since you brought up wave, I meant to ask this one.
[00:56:45.320 --> 00:56:48.080]   Is novel coming out with a first enterprise
[00:56:48.080 --> 00:56:49.200]   app on top of wave?
[00:56:49.200 --> 00:56:50.520]   I don't know, are we releasing that?
[00:56:50.520 --> 00:56:53.120]   Is that a big deal?
[00:56:53.120 --> 00:56:55.240]   Is it a server?
[00:56:55.240 --> 00:56:56.560]   What are they released?
[00:56:56.560 --> 00:57:00.200]   They're released product, novel pulse.
[00:57:00.200 --> 00:57:01.120]   And I just thought that it was--
[00:57:01.120 --> 00:57:03.720]   one of the reasons I'm asking is, it seemed amazing to me
[00:57:03.720 --> 00:57:05.120]   that a company was going to announce
[00:57:05.120 --> 00:57:07.080]   and release a product on top of wave, which
[00:57:07.080 --> 00:57:08.360]   is so unfinished and early.
[00:57:08.360 --> 00:57:09.760]   It's unproductized, yeah.
[00:57:09.760 --> 00:57:10.040]   Yeah.
[00:57:10.040 --> 00:57:10.840]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:57:10.840 --> 00:57:12.240]   You know, I read a little bit about it.
[00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:15.080]   I think it's really interesting that the whole enterprise
[00:57:15.080 --> 00:57:17.120]   spin on wave--
[00:57:17.120 --> 00:57:20.040]   yeah, I mean, for something-- it's such so early.
[00:57:20.040 --> 00:57:22.480]   And for something that just hasn't had the same kind
[00:57:22.480 --> 00:57:24.680]   of penetration, I do think that they're
[00:57:24.680 --> 00:57:26.320]   interesting enterprise opportunities.
[00:57:26.320 --> 00:57:28.360]   And I do think that that's interesting that novel released
[00:57:28.360 --> 00:57:28.680]   something.
[00:57:28.680 --> 00:57:30.640]   I mean, I think right now, a wave just really
[00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:33.920]   needs to get more people on board, get more users on board
[00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:36.240]   and prove that it's going to be viable and stick around.
[00:57:36.240 --> 00:57:38.480]   I mean, I wrote a book about it because I think that it will.
[00:57:38.480 --> 00:57:40.320]   But I'm not positive.
[00:57:40.320 --> 00:57:41.520]   No, I am positive.
[00:57:41.520 --> 00:57:42.360]   I think you were right.
[00:57:42.360 --> 00:57:45.000]   And I think it's just a matter of time.
[00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:47.640]   But that is really interesting that novel is--
[00:57:47.640 --> 00:57:48.640]   so what is the--
[00:57:48.640 --> 00:57:50.640]   A real-time communication authoring--
[00:57:50.640 --> 00:57:52.680]   it sounds like it's backup.
[00:57:52.680 --> 00:57:55.880]   Available via the cloud or as an appliance.
[00:57:55.880 --> 00:57:56.920]   It must be a server.
[00:57:56.920 --> 00:57:58.640]   It must be a server.
[00:57:58.640 --> 00:58:02.360]   It's a collaborative document creation product
[00:58:02.360 --> 00:58:03.680]   for the--
[00:58:03.680 --> 00:58:07.240]   I wonder if it's kind of a red-hatting of wave.
[00:58:07.240 --> 00:58:09.040]   Yeah, I think it's exactly what it is.
[00:58:09.040 --> 00:58:09.880]   You've used the service.
[00:58:09.880 --> 00:58:10.680]   It's like you have your own--
[00:58:10.680 --> 00:58:14.160]   Coming in mid-2010, Pulse will be first delivered as a service
[00:58:14.160 --> 00:58:16.560]   then a later for on-premise deployment.
[00:58:16.560 --> 00:58:19.200]   So I think it's their custom wave server is what it is.
[00:58:19.200 --> 00:58:20.520]   So this is their custom wave server?
[00:58:20.520 --> 00:58:23.080]   One personal email and Google Wave inbox and information
[00:58:23.080 --> 00:58:25.200]   relating to their tasks and work groups.
[00:58:25.200 --> 00:58:26.080]   Yeah, that makes sense.
[00:58:26.080 --> 00:58:30.040]   If you're a business, you're going to want a box.
[00:58:30.040 --> 00:58:32.960]   Google may do one, but why not get it from novel?
[00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:35.720]   I'm a little worried, though, about all the Wave Pulse
[00:58:35.720 --> 00:58:37.560]   beat-throb.
[00:58:37.560 --> 00:58:38.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:58:38.560 --> 00:58:39.400]   Stop there, we'll stop.
[00:58:39.400 --> 00:58:40.000]   Yeah, I mean--
[00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:40.200]   I just--
[00:58:40.200 --> 00:58:41.320]   You're starting to get a little dirty.
[00:58:41.320 --> 00:58:42.960]   I know.
[00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:45.960]   But I mean, look at all the verbiage on this Pulse website.
[00:58:45.960 --> 00:58:48.400]   Catch the beat and ride the wave.
[00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:52.280]   Novel Pulse works seamlessly.
[00:58:52.280 --> 00:58:54.520]   It's just a matter of time before somebody gets Google
[00:58:54.520 --> 00:58:55.520]   Throb.
[00:58:55.520 --> 00:58:56.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:58:56.520 --> 00:58:57.520]   Google Throb.
[00:58:57.520 --> 00:58:58.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:58:58.520 --> 00:58:59.520]   Google Throb.
[00:58:59.520 --> 00:59:00.520]   Oh, god.
[00:59:00.520 --> 00:59:01.520]   Yeah, I'm a fan girl.
[00:59:01.520 --> 00:59:02.520]   I don't know.
[00:59:02.520 --> 00:59:03.520]   That's taking it a little too quiver.
[00:59:03.520 --> 00:59:05.120]   I got the new quiver server.
[00:59:05.120 --> 00:59:06.520]   It's with Throb enabled.
[00:59:06.520 --> 00:59:08.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:59:08.320 --> 00:59:09.760]   Watch out for that pulsing.
[00:59:09.760 --> 00:59:11.760]   And anyway, I don't know.
[00:59:11.760 --> 00:59:13.840]   It's a little too much like jello for me.
[00:59:13.840 --> 00:59:16.600]   Our number of the week from Mr. Tech Jarvis.
[00:59:16.600 --> 00:59:18.400]   Ah, I confess I looked and looked and looked.
[00:59:18.400 --> 00:59:19.800]   No numbers.
[00:59:19.800 --> 00:59:20.640]   I found a number.
[00:59:20.640 --> 00:59:22.200]   It's a boring number, but I'll give it to you anyway.
[00:59:22.200 --> 00:59:23.200]   OK.
[00:59:23.200 --> 00:59:24.200]   Look away.
[00:59:24.200 --> 00:59:27.840]   The latest comm score numbers.
[00:59:27.840 --> 00:59:32.240]   Microsoft percent of time spent online by region worldwide is
[00:59:32.240 --> 00:59:35.480]   14 and 1/2% versus Google is 9.3%.
[00:59:35.480 --> 00:59:36.920]   And I saw a lot of blog posts about the same.
[00:59:36.920 --> 00:59:38.120]   Oh, oh, oh, Microsoft bigger.
[00:59:38.120 --> 00:59:40.200]   But of course, that's because Microsoft tries to hold you
[00:59:40.200 --> 00:59:43.040]   into a prison like Yahoo, and Google doesn't.
[00:59:43.040 --> 00:59:44.040]   Right.
[00:59:44.040 --> 00:59:45.800]   But that's my-- that's a boring number.
[00:59:45.800 --> 00:59:46.680]   I had to confess.
[00:59:46.680 --> 00:59:50.520]   I wish we'd found how many hits a day the Google front page
[00:59:50.520 --> 00:59:50.840]   has.
[00:59:50.840 --> 00:59:51.840]   That would be a nice--
[00:59:51.840 --> 00:59:53.480]   I looked and I could not get it.
[00:59:53.480 --> 00:59:55.480]   Yeah.
[00:59:55.480 --> 00:59:58.120]   I would-- that would be-- that would be really--
[00:59:58.120 --> 00:59:59.560]   it's got to be.
[00:59:59.560 --> 01:00:00.960]   You know, Google just doesn't publish it.
[01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:02.280]   You know, it just doesn't kill you.
[01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:03.240]   Yeah.
[01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:06.960]   It's like the secret recipe to Coca-Cola.
[01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:09.160]   Just something magical.
[01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:12.040]   My tool of the week is Google's dashboard.
[01:00:12.040 --> 01:00:13.560]   And I guess both of you found it.
[01:00:13.560 --> 01:00:14.880]   It came out this week though, didn't it?
[01:00:14.880 --> 01:00:16.560]   Or at least I saw the blog post this week.
[01:00:16.560 --> 01:00:17.080]   Yeah.
[01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:18.160]   It did come out this week.
[01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:20.920]   The idea is that you can see in one spot
[01:00:20.920 --> 01:00:25.200]   all of your Google accounts.
[01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:29.280]   And boy, I was kind of stunned at how many Google accounts I had.
[01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:30.640]   It's a bit of a reckoning, isn't it?
[01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:31.120]   Yeah.
[01:00:31.120 --> 01:00:32.040]   It's like, whoa.
[01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:35.760]   I guess-- I guess I'm glad I'm doing a Google show.
[01:00:35.760 --> 01:00:38.600]   So here's my Google dashboard page.
[01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:40.360]   If you go to google.com/dashboard,
[01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:41.320]   you can sign into yours.
[01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:43.120]   It lets you manage these accounts,
[01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:46.240]   edit your personal information, tells you, in the case
[01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:51.240]   of Google, for instance, what my authorized email addresses are
[01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:54.160]   and what websites are authorized to access the account.
[01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:57.600]   I also have Blogger, Calendar, Contacts, Docs,
[01:00:57.600 --> 01:01:02.160]   Friend Connect, Gmail, Sync, Health, iGoogle, Latitude,
[01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:04.920]   or Cut-- I didn't even know I had an orchid account--
[01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:05.960]   Picasso web album.
[01:01:05.960 --> 01:01:07.560]   That's friends in Brazil you never know.
[01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:10.920]   Yeah, that's exactly.
[01:01:10.920 --> 01:01:14.960]   Profile, reader, talk, tasks, voice.
[01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:17.640]   Your web history is in here, YouTube.
[01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:20.360]   And then there are 20 additional products
[01:01:20.360 --> 01:01:22.160]   not yet available in the dashboard,
[01:01:22.160 --> 01:01:27.240]   including Analytics Checkout, Video AdSense, App Engine, Sync,
[01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:31.760]   Groups, Canal, Local Business Center, Google Maps,
[01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:33.640]   Mobile News, Canal.
[01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:34.280]   I had to-- you know what?
[01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:36.120]   I had to make Canal account-- is that how you say it?
[01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:37.320]   It's "Nal."
[01:01:37.320 --> 01:01:37.920]   It's "Nal."
[01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:39.240]   I like it's "Nal."
[01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:40.720]   But it's "Canal."
[01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:43.160]   I just scroll down my dashboard as you're reading off
[01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:44.040]   yours, Leo.
[01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:45.960]   And we do have quite a bit of parallels,
[01:01:45.960 --> 01:01:48.120]   although you do have a couple products that I don't have.
[01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:49.960]   And I think I have a couple that you don't have.
[01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:51.680]   But from mine at the bottom, it says,
[01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:55.240]   15 additional products are not yet available in the dashboard.
[01:01:55.240 --> 01:01:55.600]   Wow.
[01:01:55.600 --> 01:01:56.680]   So it's interesting.
[01:01:56.680 --> 01:01:57.680]   Now, this isn't--
[01:01:57.680 --> 01:01:59.360]   You have a Google code account.
[01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:00.680]   I probably don't have one of those.
[01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:00.880]   I'm sure.
[01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:01.680]   Yeah, I do.
[01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:02.600]   I do have a code account.
[01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:07.120]   Now, this is all the data that's stored in one Google account,
[01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:07.480]   right?
[01:02:07.480 --> 01:02:09.000]   This isn't every Google account that you own.
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:11.000]   No, this is just one.
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:12.880]   You want to count all the products, right?
[01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:13.880]   All the data you have different products.
[01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:15.360]   Because I have a ton of Google accounts.
[01:02:15.360 --> 01:02:16.520]   And this is just the--
[01:02:16.520 --> 01:02:18.360]   This is just what I really wish this had.
[01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:20.520]   And others have blogged and tweeted this,
[01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:25.080]   is what Google uses to target me and the opportunity
[01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:28.600]   to correct it and change it and get a sense of what
[01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:31.600]   Google knows about me and what my relationship is with that.
[01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:34.320]   Can't you assume that they use it all?
[01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:38.320]   Well, yes, but it's the Amazon problem.
[01:02:38.320 --> 01:02:40.400]   Just because you bought Christmas records once, Leo,
[01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:41.720]   you don't want to buy them all the time.
[01:02:41.720 --> 01:02:43.240]   Right.
[01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:45.640]   So what they're-- you'd be nice to see a little graph
[01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:47.120]   with how they weigh.
[01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:51.960]   Like, how much weight do they give my account?
[01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:54.480]   Well, if you corrected that, how much more
[01:02:54.480 --> 01:02:55.840]   valuable were their data be?
[01:02:55.840 --> 01:02:56.680]   Right.
[01:02:56.680 --> 01:02:58.520]   And it targets for you better, but it also says--
[01:02:58.520 --> 01:02:59.680]   Yeah, you should let me do that.
[01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:01.080]   You're right.
[01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:03.280]   In a way, that's what profile kind of starts.
[01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:05.440]   That's the journey that profile starts, yeah.
[01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:07.280]   They've got to get gutsy about it, I think,
[01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:09.480]   and put up things that will surprise us.
[01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:11.120]   And then we'll then bring us in to do that
[01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:12.840]   and create a Google account and do all those other things
[01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:15.160]   to say, I want to have control of this.
[01:03:15.160 --> 01:03:17.240]   So we can clarify, yeah.
[01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:19.280]   I heard I don't know who it was at this four-square conference.
[01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:22.040]   I was talking about an ad opportunity
[01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:24.320]   where you're going to be shown a commercial for a COLA.
[01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:26.200]   Which COLA would you like to see the commercial for?
[01:03:26.200 --> 01:03:27.280]   Right.
[01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:28.800]   It was Hulu.
[01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:29.560]   And a SMART.
[01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:31.000]   Oh, yeah, Dick does that.
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:32.480]   I think it's the smartest thing I've ever seen,
[01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:34.880]   where you thumbs up, thumbs down on ads.
[01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:35.380]   Yeah.
[01:03:35.380 --> 01:03:37.600]   And at first, I thought, what are they crazy advertisers
[01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:38.280]   you're going to hate them?
[01:03:38.280 --> 01:03:40.080]   And maybe it was you who has explained it to me.
[01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:40.960]   Oh, no.
[01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:41.960]   Advertisers love it.
[01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:44.640]   They only want to show the ads to people that want to see them.
[01:03:44.640 --> 01:03:45.520]   It's targeting.
[01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:45.960]   Right.
[01:03:45.960 --> 01:03:48.320]   And arbor.com, which killed its paper,
[01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:49.920]   and they killed with an online site, which
[01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:52.320]   I consulted for, full disclosure,
[01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:54.200]   has the users vote on the ads.
[01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:57.080]   They have one day a week, Sunday paper, still coming out.
[01:03:57.080 --> 01:03:59.800]   And the ad that the users vote best
[01:03:59.800 --> 01:04:03.440]   appears on the top of page one of the Sunday paper.
[01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:05.040]   That's so smart.
[01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:05.680]   That is cool.
[01:04:05.680 --> 01:04:06.320]   That's what you have.
[01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:09.160]   But ads, you get rewarded with more, which is kind of Google
[01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:10.880]   think, right?
[01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:18.240]   So guess who knows how many hits per day the Google page gets?
[01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:19.480]   Vorak.
[01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:22.160]   Wolf from Alpha.
[01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:24.440]   And I thank our chat room for discovering this.
[01:04:24.440 --> 01:04:25.920]   Of course, they asked the question.
[01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:27.320]   And would you like to guess?
[01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:32.480]   This is our going to be our number 5.7 billion daily page
[01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:33.320]   views.
[01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:34.320]   Now that says for all--
[01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:35.480]   Can you keep a loan?
[01:04:35.480 --> 01:04:37.160]   No, that's for all of Google's.
[01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:37.760]   Let's see.
[01:04:37.760 --> 01:04:39.440]   We have information for it.
[01:04:39.440 --> 01:04:41.440]   What's the date on that?
[01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:43.160]   They just did this search.
[01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:46.120]   Oh, domain online since 1997.
[01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:47.640]   Site rank number one.
[01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:50.160]   Daily visitors 570 million.
[01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:51.560]   That's from Alexa.
[01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:52.240]   That's from Alexa.
[01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:53.240]   Oh, OK.
[01:04:53.240 --> 01:04:55.080]   So that's going to be somewhat suspect,
[01:04:55.080 --> 01:04:56.400]   because you have to have the Alexa total.
[01:04:56.400 --> 01:04:57.080]   At least you got an answer.
[01:04:57.080 --> 01:04:57.800]   I gave you nothing.
[01:04:57.800 --> 01:04:58.440]   I failed you.
[01:04:58.440 --> 01:04:59.440]   We got a number.
[01:04:59.440 --> 01:05:00.880]   And it came from Wolf from where else?
[01:05:00.880 --> 01:05:01.440]   Wolf from.
[01:05:01.440 --> 01:05:02.240]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:05:02.240 --> 01:05:04.080]   By the way, one more thing on the Google dashboard
[01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:06.280]   at the very bottom of the Google dashboard page
[01:05:06.280 --> 01:05:07.840]   is says something kind of interesting.
[01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:10.240]   Is this everything?
[01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:13.600]   So it does give you the chance, at least a little bit,
[01:05:13.600 --> 01:05:16.320]   to elaborate.
[01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:17.680]   I don't know what that would--
[01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:18.120]   let me see.
[01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:18.960]   Is this everything?
[01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:19.400]   What do I get?
[01:05:19.400 --> 01:05:23.360]   Oh, it's just a help page that says not yet.
[01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:25.320]   There are other kinds of data that Google records
[01:05:25.320 --> 01:05:27.680]   when you use its services, which are not associated
[01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:30.280]   server logs, cookies, internet-based advertising.
[01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:32.360]   There is a Google Ads preference manager.
[01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:33.640]   I wonder what that is.
[01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:36.280]   It lets you opt out of interest-based ads altogether.
[01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:39.760]   So you can actually do this.
[01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:40.600]   Jeff, look.
[01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:41.000]   You can.
[01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:41.400]   Oh, good.
[01:05:41.400 --> 01:05:43.960]   I've specified, make the ads you see on the web more interesting.
[01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:46.800]   I did this ages ago, I guess, because I don't remember doing it.
[01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:47.680]   Oh, good, good, good.
[01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:48.680]   I show my interests.
[01:05:48.680 --> 01:05:49.600]   I opt out.
[01:05:49.600 --> 01:05:51.120]   I have my cookie.
[01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:52.320]   And it gives it to me right here.
[01:05:52.320 --> 01:05:52.720]   So I can--
[01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:53.640]   Well, that's beautiful.
[01:05:53.640 --> 01:05:54.800]   It's better than nothing.
[01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:55.640]   That's so smart.
[01:05:55.640 --> 01:05:56.480]   That's so smart.
[01:05:56.480 --> 01:05:57.640]   This is a new one on me.
[01:05:57.640 --> 01:05:58.360]   Interesting.
[01:05:58.360 --> 01:05:58.800]   And you know what?
[01:05:58.800 --> 01:05:59.960]   I always want something more.
[01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:00.800]   I always want something more.
[01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:02.200]   I want to make it easy for people to do.
[01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:03.560]   And I think there's a huge value there.
[01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:04.060]   Yeah.
[01:06:04.060 --> 01:06:06.040]   It's hidden now, so I couldn't find it.
[01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:07.880]   Well, I did this ages ago.
[01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:09.480]   I don't even remember doing it.
[01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:10.920]   What's it under again?
[01:06:10.920 --> 01:06:13.040]   How did you find it?
[01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:16.840]   If you go to google.com/dashboard, go to the bottom where it says,
[01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:19.560]   is this everything, click that link.
[01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:22.560]   And then it says interest-based advertising.
[01:06:22.560 --> 01:06:26.080]   And there's a link there to the Google ad preference
[01:06:26.080 --> 01:06:26.880]   manager.
[01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:28.160]   I guess they were talking about doing that.
[01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:28.640]   I know they've done it.
[01:06:28.640 --> 01:06:29.160]   OK, great.
[01:06:29.160 --> 01:06:32.160]   I guess it's google.com/ads/preferences.
[01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:33.920]   Let me see if that works.
[01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:34.600]   Yeah, that does.
[01:06:34.600 --> 01:06:37.440]   google.com/ads/preferences.
[01:06:37.440 --> 01:06:37.960]   And you know what?
[01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:39.960]   They probably did it three years ago,
[01:06:39.960 --> 01:06:44.200]   because I have information in here that I only--
[01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:45.120]   Yeah.
[01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:47.280]   Do you remember doing it?
[01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:50.520]   We need to do a show on Google products
[01:06:50.520 --> 01:06:51.800]   you've forgotten about.
[01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:53.680]   Oh, all of them.
[01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:56.240]   They do the worst job of exposing their stuff.
[01:06:56.240 --> 01:06:59.800]   But it's perhaps because they have so gosh darn much of it.
[01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:01.400]   Yeah, interesting.
[01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:03.560]   I mean, here we are.
[01:07:03.560 --> 01:07:06.280]   Supposedly Google experts, you wrote a freaking book on it
[01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:07.280]   there, Mr. Jarvis.
[01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:08.080]   Look at me.
[01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:09.600]   You wrote a freaking book.
[01:07:09.600 --> 01:07:11.920]   And you did too, Gina.
[01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:14.840]   Gina's book is available online right now.
[01:07:14.840 --> 01:07:17.840]   Completewaveguide.com.
[01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:18.360]   Right?
[01:07:18.360 --> 01:07:18.860]   Yes.
[01:07:18.860 --> 01:07:18.860]   Yes.
[01:07:18.860 --> 01:07:20.040]   I didn't turn it around this time.
[01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:20.720]   Completely.
[01:07:20.720 --> 01:07:22.680]   And the server's up today.
[01:07:22.680 --> 01:07:23.680]   It's crazy.
[01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:25.600]   We're getting nuts.
[01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:26.040]   Really?
[01:07:26.040 --> 01:07:28.240]   So everybody can go there right now?
[01:07:28.240 --> 01:07:29.840]   Everybody can go there right now.
[01:07:29.840 --> 01:07:31.360]   My sister's going to love this.
[01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:33.760]   I moved servers this week.
[01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:34.280]   Oh, did you?
[01:07:34.280 --> 01:07:34.800]   Oh, good.
[01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:35.680]   Oh, yeah, I did.
[01:07:35.680 --> 01:07:37.040]   And he was like, bring it on.
[01:07:37.040 --> 01:07:38.160]   So this is your test.
[01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:39.560]   Everyone can go there right now.
[01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:40.320]   Bring it on.
[01:07:40.320 --> 01:07:41.840]   Completewaveguide.com.
[01:07:41.840 --> 01:07:42.920]   That's Gina's new book.
[01:07:42.920 --> 01:07:45.360]   You can participate by creating an account.
[01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:48.120]   And you can even read it online before it becomes a book.
[01:07:48.120 --> 01:07:51.880]   But it will be a PDF available for purchase and update
[01:07:51.880 --> 01:07:54.920]   regularly sometime this month, yes?
[01:07:54.920 --> 01:07:57.000]   Yeah, this month where I actually just handed over
[01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.840]   the manuscript for the PDF to my copy after last night.
[01:07:59.840 --> 01:08:00.880]   So it'll be in a couple of weeks.
[01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:03.120]   Dang, you work hard.
[01:08:03.120 --> 01:08:05.880]   Who are the hardest working person in show business?
[01:08:05.880 --> 01:08:08.320]   You're impressive.
[01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:09.280]   I sent my pajamas.
[01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:12.280]   I sent my book publisher, President Gina, at this conference.
[01:08:12.280 --> 01:08:14.680]   And I said that you were inventing the future of books
[01:08:14.680 --> 01:08:16.520]   and told them to go look at it.
[01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:19.240]   Oh, thank you.
[01:08:19.240 --> 01:08:20.320]   Watch out for sure.
[01:08:20.320 --> 01:08:22.000]   Of your office, Gina.
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:25.080]   That would be an awkward conversation.
[01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:30.560]   Speaking as the past of books, I honor you and thank you.
[01:08:30.560 --> 01:08:34.120]   The ghost of books past, that's me.
[01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:38.240]   Jeff Jarvis is the ghost of all things future in journalism.
[01:08:38.240 --> 01:08:42.720]   You can find his great blog, a must read at buzzmachine.com.
[01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:45.040]   And anything else you want to plug?
[01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:46.320]   You're going to be at Yale next week.
[01:08:46.320 --> 01:08:46.320]   Next week.
[01:08:46.320 --> 01:08:48.000]   A book called What Would Google Do?
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:49.640]   Ah, that's it.
[01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:52.240]   I haven't done it for two shows, so I can at least get one plug.
[01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:53.400]   You get a plug every show.
[01:08:53.400 --> 01:08:54.160]   It's a great book.
[01:08:54.160 --> 01:08:57.080]   A must read book available on Audible, as well as in bookstores
[01:08:57.080 --> 01:08:58.160]   and Amazon.
[01:08:58.160 --> 01:08:59.600]   You must get it.
[01:08:59.600 --> 01:09:00.360]   I'm Leo LaPorn.
[01:09:00.360 --> 01:09:01.560]   I thank you for being here.
[01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:04.120]   And make sure you watch the show at a different time.

[01:09:18.640 --> 01:09:20.200]   And then we'll just segue right into Twit.
[01:09:20.200 --> 01:09:22.400]   It'll be a Twig Twit Sunday.
[01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:23.960]   Thank you all for being here.
