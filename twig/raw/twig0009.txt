[00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.040]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:06.400]   It's time for Twig the show that covers all things
[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:12.800]   Google-us-t, Google-is-us, on the line with us, Jeff Jarvis,
[00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.200]   the great man at buzzmachine.com.
[00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.480]   Hey, Jeff, how are you today?
[00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:18.600]   Hey, there, Leo.
[00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.120]   Good to see you.
[00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.720]   Also here, the great Gina Trapani from smarterwear.org.
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:25.680]   Hi, Gina.
[00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.640]   Hi, howdy.
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.280]   How's it going?
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.120]   Howdy.
[00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.120]   I guess you're California.
[00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.120]   You could say howdy.
[00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.120]   Yeah, I was trying on my cowgirl greeting today.
[00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.120]   That was the funny thing.
[00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.440]   When we first moved to California,
[00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.240]   I was an Easterner like Jeff from I grew up in Rhode Island.
[00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.720]   And I was in 10th grade.
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.040]   We moved to California in 1971.
[00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:43.000]   People said howdy.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.120]   And I thought, well, that's strange.
[00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:45.120]   What is it?
[00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:48.200]   I feel like it was a John Wayne movie, but they meant it.
[00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.600]   They meant it.
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.160]   Well, howdy.
[00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.400]   I'm not even going to say somebody's name.
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.000]   That's true.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.880]   Because you have that high dot dot dot.
[00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:56.380]   Yeah.
[00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.800]   Was that--
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:57.960]   Yo, Larry.
[00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.520]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.920]   And as I get older, I appreciate those tricks more and more.
[00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.280]   So today we're talking about Google.
[00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.720]   We're hoping that-- oh, boy.
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.640]   Z, Siva will join us.
[00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.200]   I practiced his last name over and over.
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.560]   And I--
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.240]   He did.
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.240]   Yeah, I still don't have it.
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.400]   Just play the mp3 every time you have to say it.
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.040]   Siva Vidianathan will join us in a little bit.
[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.480]   He's an expert on the Googleization of everything.
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.040]   In fact, this name is his website.
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.280]   But also in the Google Book deal.
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:28.240]   And there is news with the Google Book deal, which
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:33.080]   we'll hold off on until such time as we get Siva on the line.
[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.360]   Meanwhile, there are plenty other things to talk about.
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.280]   Let's talk about Sidewicky.
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.600]   Because you and Gina Trapani and Jeff Jarvis both
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.080]   had pretty strong opinions about this.
[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.280]   I tried it out immediately and observed, first of all,
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.960]   that it ain't a wiki.
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.280]   In fact, it feels very 2002.
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.920]   The idea is you go to a web site.
[00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.280]   First, you have to install the Google toolbar for it to work,
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.600]   which I hesitated to do.
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.040]   But I thought, well, I'll try it.
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.120]   Then you go to a website and you get a little icon.
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.040]   And you can click it.
[00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.960]   A sidebar opens.
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:05.960]   And now you can put a comment.
[00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.120]   You can either select some text and comment on that text
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.840]   or comment on the page as a whole.
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.160]   And when you visit a page that has a Sidewicky comment,
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.120]   you see that little icon.
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.160]   You can open it up.
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.720]   What was your initial reaction to this, Gina,
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.440]   when you first saw it?
[00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.440]   You know, I thought it was odd.
[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.760]   But I thought it was fine.
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:27.560]   It isn't a wiki.
[00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.800]   I thought that that was a strange choice of name.
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.280]   But you know, I thought about every single attempt
[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.520]   that Google's made to host content, like Google NOL.
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.120]   And even the wiki features in search results.
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.200]   And they were never very successful, right?
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.720]   I mean, Blogger, I think, is the only thing
[00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:44.400]   that they own that's been successful at user-generated content.
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.440]   And that's because it--
[00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.960]   They were right.
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.560]   --before they acquired it, right?
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.440]   So I was just kind of like, nah, about it.
[00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.400]   I don't have the Google toolbar installed.
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.800]   I hear the word toolbar.
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.400]   And I want to run the other way, even though it's a Google product.
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.000]   And it's probably pretty good.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.960]   I mean, I just thought to myself, I don't really care about this.
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.400]   Probably the people who are reading my website
[00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.520]   aren't going to care about it or have the toolbar installed,
[00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.240]   either.
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:07.840]   So I didn't think it was that big a deal.
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.440]   But Jeff has a lot to say about this.
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.640]   So--
[00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:10.440]   Well, that's the funny thing.
[00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:11.600]   You can't do it in Chrome.
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.280]   I presume you're a Chrome user most of the time.
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.040]   I use Chrome when I use Firefox.
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.400]   You can't do it in Chrome, although it's
[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.360]   going to be built into Chrome eventually, they said.
[00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.520]   It will be-- yeah, it will be built into Chrome now.
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.840]   So that's interesting.
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.240]   And this is actually one of my tips for the week.
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.520]   There is a bookmarklet that you can use to view comments on a page.
[00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.560]   You can't enter comments, but you can view them.
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.600]   So if I'm just curious about what people are saying about my site,
[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:35.600]   I can do that.
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.120]   I mean, I guess I feel like conversations
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.160]   happen about my website in so many different places
[00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.360]   on Twitter and Facebook and Friend Feed.
[00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.080]   It didn't bug me too much.
[00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:48.440]   I mean, the fact that it comes in on the side and shows on your site
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.920]   is a little aggressive and strange.
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:53.880]   I mean, will Jeff-- I'll let Jeff explain
[00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.760]   what he thinks that they should do, which I actually
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.400]   agree with allheartedly.
[00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.120]   So what did you think, Jeff?
[00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.920]   You wrote a whole post on it.
[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:02.800]   Danger, danger, Will Robinson.
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.520]   I saw Google's intent, I think, was not bad.
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.800]   It was to find a way for people to annotate sites
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.480]   and to go on a given site and say, this is a scam,
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:16.960]   or this is a good company, or whatever.
[00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.240]   And that sounds good, but they didn't think it through,
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.240]   I believe.
[00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.560]   And they didn't ask themselves whether it was evil
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.080]   and holding to their mission.
[00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:25.720]   Few problems.
[00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:28.840]   First, for those of us who do have comments,
[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:31.240]   it bifurcates the comments and thus the community.
[00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.560]   It separates people when you should do the opposite.
[00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.160]   So I have comments on my blog, and people can now
[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.400]   have comments along the side on this Google thing.
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:45.240]   Second, it allows people to come in and leave spam.
[00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:46.480]   Now, granted, Google will probably
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:47.640]   have algorithms to deal with that,
[00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:52.440]   but also trolls and hate speech and grudges
[00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.960]   and unfair competition and all kinds of things people can now
[00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.480]   associate with sites.
[00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:59.960]   And no algorithm is going to be able to figure all that out.
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.600]   But we, the site owner, has no control over.
[00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.000]   So those of us who say that we care about our conversations
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   and communities, we can't do anything.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.360]   Now, people gave me some crap properly because I said,
[00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:13.000]   oh, Jarvis says, newspapers should give up control
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.560]   and hear he wants control.
[00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:17.160]   Well, it's not about control, but it's about responsibility.
[00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:21.360]   And I can't exercise responsibility over those comments
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.200]   that are the side of my blog.
[00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:25.920]   Third, if they're not putting ads on,
[00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:26.760]   they're not putting ads on.
[00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.960]   If they ever did, they'll be in deep do-do.
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:30.880]   There was a case of something called Gate Her
[00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:35.640]   about eight years ago that put up ads on top of people's websites
[00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:38.280]   and the publisher sued and won.
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:41.000]   And so this idea of being able to hijack the knowledge of what's
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.800]   on my site and add something to it is a problem.
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:45.160]   So those were all the problems I presented one day.
[00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.920]   The next day I came back and suggested that the problem
[00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:51.360]   in the end was Google thought too small.
[00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:54.120]   It wanted to create another conversation space.
[00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:55.840]   Well, we got plenty of conversation spaces.
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:59.920]   Hell, the internet is the conversation space.
[00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:02.600]   And if Google thought like Google, if dare I say this,
[00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.680]   if they'd asked what would Google do,
[00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:07.600]   they would, I think, have said, can we
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:11.600]   find a way to better organize that conversation space?
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:14.320]   And as they want to organize the world's knowledge.
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:17.280]   And I think that would be by not creating a means
[00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:20.800]   to put content on Google in a centralized world.
[00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:23.160]   They should be-- what they were doing was hurting the edge
[00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:24.040]   and centralizing.
[00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:25.840]   They were going away from the cloud and back down
[00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:26.760]   on the ground.
[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:28.760]   And that's not very googling.
[00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:32.040]   If instead they turned out strictly an API that said,
[00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:36.240]   here's a means of gathering comments not only on your blog
[00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:40.600]   but elsewhere about you and put them together with some sense.
[00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:43.640]   In that process, I suggest they probably should buy a technorati
[00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:46.720]   and put them out of their misery and organize
[00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:47.840]   the conversation on the web.
[00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:48.960]   And that would be useful.
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:50.400]   But what they've done instead is they've
[00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:53.160]   tried to centralize the conversation on the web.
[00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:53.920]   And that's dangerous.
[00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:55.960]   Well, almost in a way, decentralized it
[00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:58.080]   because it's attached to each page.
[00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:00.440]   I'm thinking if they had something like technorati
[00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:04.720]   or friend feed where the discussion was,
[00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:07.000]   you could go-- but this is going to be a problem anyway
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.160]   because I mean, I look at my comments.
[00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:10.520]   They're spread out everywhere.
[00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:11.120]   They're on Twitter.
[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:12.560]   They're on friend feed.
[00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:14.880]   They're spread out anyway.
[00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:16.360]   And a lot of people are using discuss
[00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:20.200]   or I use JSKits Echo to kind of re-aggregate those back
[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:23.680]   into the website because Google did put an API on Sidewicky.
[00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:25.920]   There's no reason those tools couldn't
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:29.320]   be enhanced to include Sidewicky stuff as well.
[00:08:29.320 --> 00:08:30.960]   But all you get is Sidewicky then.
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:33.240]   You don't get all that other stuff that you want.
[00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:35.360]   Somebody said in reaction to what I was saying,
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:39.040]   well, Jarvis, a conversation that's already fractured.
[00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:39.560]   Right.
[00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:41.560]   And I said, well, I think it's a bad choice of words
[00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:44.240]   because that implies that it's broken.
[00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:45.920]   No, the conversation is distributed.
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:47.680]   That's the way it's meant to be.
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:50.680]   And Google should be looking on top of that in a meta way
[00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:52.800]   and figuring out how to add value to that.
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:57.400]   Instead, very old media, they try to extract pieces of it.
[00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:59.520]   So it sounds like-- I mean, it sounds like the fear
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:01.640]   is that Google is hosting these comments.
[00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:05.120]   And because they're so ubiquitous and they have such control
[00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:07.680]   over rank and your comments show up
[00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:09.720]   and your Google profile, for example,
[00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:12.840]   so comments you make inside Wiki show up and your Google profile,
[00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:15.600]   that this is the part that scares me a little bit.
[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:17.840]   It's like, why is Google hosting content?
[00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:20.160]   When other startups come up like Facebook and Twitter
[00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:21.480]   where people are talking about my site,
[00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:22.920]   I don't have as much of a problem with it.
[00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:25.200]   But it's like when Google pushes this commenting system
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:28.520]   into their toolbar, which apparently has millions of users,
[00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:29.840]   this is the part that gets a little scary.
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:31.920]   It feels like now they're trying to host conversations
[00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:34.200]   or take host conversations away from my site
[00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:36.920]   when typically their strategy has always
[00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:40.960]   been to give you access to other web pages.
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:43.960]   Well, you raise a really good point, Jeff, as well.
[00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:46.760]   I mean, what if people put crap in there?
[00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:47.720]   How do I control that?
[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:49.160]   I can't, really, right?
[00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:49.560]   I mean--
[00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:53.320]   Yeah, no one's going to know the troll who's after you.
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:54.920]   You could have someone who's stalking you or--
[00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:58.520]   Oh, dude, I have plenty of people who look for wherever
[00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:02.520]   I am and put, say, Leo's a jerk or the equivalent.
[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:03.760]   That happens all the time.
[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:05.360]   And I have no control over that.
[00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:07.040]   So if you're--
[00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:08.360]   I'm sorry, go ahead, Jeff.
[00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:09.160]   Go ahead.
[00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:11.520]   I was just going to say, I mean, there are some things, right?
[00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:13.320]   So if you claim ownership of your site
[00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:16.240]   through Google Webmaster Tools, if you make a comment
[00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:19.440]   on your site, you will be recognized as the site owner.
[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:20.240]   So that's one thing.
[00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:23.360]   And you can report or vote down comments.
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:24.360]   You can report abuse.
[00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:25.640]   I do like the karma stuff.
[00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:26.880]   I think that that's kind of cool.
[00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:30.040]   So in fact, it's weird because people--
[00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:31.720]   you get a page of comments and then it says,
[00:10:31.720 --> 00:10:33.880]   if you want to see the less interesting comments,
[00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:38.080]   press the zero and you get voted down comments.
[00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:38.360]   Right.
[00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:40.200]   Which is--
[00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:42.520]   it feels like a parasite, to be honest with you.
[00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:47.800]   It feels like a limpet stuck on the side of my website.
[00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:51.120]   So if I register with Google for these Webmaster Tools,
[00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:54.000]   I can then delete comments I don't like, Gina?
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.400]   No, you can't delete comments.
[00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:57.680]   You can-- you are merely--
[00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:59.320]   I think somehow they notate that you
[00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:01.520]   are the owner of the site in the comments.
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:02.640]   I believe that it's highlighted.
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:04.080]   I think Danny Sullivan wrote this up.
[00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:06.480]   I haven't actually tried it yet.
[00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:08.160]   I feel bad actually commenting on this.
[00:11:08.160 --> 00:11:10.040]   I don't even really care about Side Wiki very much
[00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:10.800]   because I'm probably not--
[00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:11.240]   Well, I don't care.
[00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:11.880]   I don't want it.
[00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:14.200]   But at the same time, I'm stuck with it, right?
[00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:15.440]   Well, right.
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:17.320]   And I believe that most--
[00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:19.960]   I think you claim your site in order to set up Google Analytics.
[00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:22.360]   This is something that most websites owners probably
[00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:24.480]   have already done anyway.
[00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:26.440]   So you can't delete comments.
[00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:27.680]   But I think you can vote them down.
[00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:30.360]   And I think you can report abuse of what you think is a troll.
[00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:35.160]   But like Jeff says, only you really have the history
[00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:38.200]   and know the trolls, the people that are harassing you
[00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:40.400]   and just giving you a hard time for no good reason.
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:42.600]   Well, what's funny is right now, it seems to be down
[00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:44.640]   because I put-- when I-- when they--
[00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:45.360]   I tried it out.
[00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:48.640]   I put a comment on my blog.
[00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:49.520]   Actually, it was kind of fun.
[00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:53.040]   It was a meta comment on my blog about the history of my blog.
[00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:54.320]   Here's what you're going to get.
[00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:56.560]   So it's kind of a fun little meta comment.
[00:11:56.560 --> 00:11:57.880]   But now it's not even showing up.
[00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:58.380]   Right.
[00:11:58.380 --> 00:11:58.920]   I'm not kidding either.
[00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:01.400]   I think Zagwiki's down.
[00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:02.360]   So thank you, Google.
[00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:03.760]   Better that than Gmail.
[00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:06.040]   Maybe they can reconsider it already.
[00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:06.560]   Oh, there it is.
[00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:07.400]   No, it's working now.
[00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:08.640]   Is it?
[00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:11.560]   I think it was one of the best comments I saw.
[00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:13.600]   One was from a blog called Stuntbox
[00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:17.240]   that said that this showed a failure of empathy.
[00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:18.960]   They just didn't sit down and put themselves
[00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:22.520]   in the shoes of others and say, how is this going to affect them?
[00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:26.400]   And that's-- and I think Google forgets how big they are.
[00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:30.240]   My response to that gracious metaphor was a less gracious one.
[00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:32.320]   I said that Google probably thinks of itself
[00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:34.320]   as snuffle-up-akets.
[00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:35.640]   Oh, I'm just big.
[00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:36.480]   I don't know.
[00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:38.360]   And they don't realize when they want to kill a fly,
[00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:40.800]   they can put their fists through the wall.
[00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:43.480]   And they've got to realize that now.
[00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:45.240]   And it's a problem of size, too.
[00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:46.360]   Just to help the company operates.
[00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:48.160]   The other comment, though, I like the gaming comfort
[00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:48.880]   was yours, Gina.
[00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:51.720]   Your tweet on it said--
[00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:54.360]   That I thought Sidewiki would go the way of Google Now,
[00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:56.520]   which means that you'll never hear about it again after this week.
[00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:57.520]   I think that's probably true.
[00:12:57.520 --> 00:12:59.720]   We're the ones who are talking about it.
[00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:01.160]   And that's in Google's defense.
[00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:03.200]   They have the labs, and they have a lot of things in the labs.
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:04.880]   And I think that's the whole idea,
[00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:07.920]   is that we can try out all sorts of things.
[00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:11.400]   And we're not invested in any of them.
[00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:13.720]   But this does change the ecology.
[00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:14.840]   And you're right.
[00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:16.400]   They're not snuffle-up, I guess.
[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:17.720]   They carry a lot of weight.
[00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:19.000]   Well, you know what's interesting?
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.720]   I defend the Google beta culture, the throw it up against the wall
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:23.760]   and see what sticks.
[00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:25.480]   And I think that's exactly right.
[00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:27.520]   But I think they've got to find the way to do caveats.
[00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:31.520]   And the way to put something like this out, I think, is to ask us,
[00:13:31.520 --> 00:13:32.680]   is this a good idea?
[00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:33.600]   What are the dangers here?
[00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:34.960]   What are the benefits here?
[00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:37.400]   And to enable that conversation, that's kind of not what happened.
[00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:39.400]   They just said, oh, look, it's wonderful.
[00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:40.800]   You're welcome.
[00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:43.240]   And a lot of us look like gift horse to the mouth.
[00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:44.520]   I think we broke it.
[00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:45.600]   It's not working.
[00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:47.280]   I can't get it to load.
[00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:51.840]   Jeff, if Google had launches as an API only with a WordPress
[00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:55.120]   plugin demonstration that you could have tried on your site,
[00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:57.840]   inline on your site first, would you have felt differently
[00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:00.160]   if they hadn't gotten the toolbar involved?
[00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:01.040]   Yes, I think so.
[00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:04.240]   I think that association with somebody-- a new user comes in,
[00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:08.480]   uses Chrome, has no idea that this is some separate thing.
[00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:10.840]   They think it's part of the site I'm looking at.
[00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:11.800]   That's a danger.
[00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:12.360]   One.
[00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:16.560]   Two, the fact that Google is trying to host these things.
[00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:18.520]   It's the same problem we discussed last show,
[00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:21.920]   Gene, when you asked about why people are concerned about Google
[00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:23.720]   Book Search, and my answer right or wrong--
[00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:25.560]   I wish we had Siva here to talk with--
[00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:28.280]   but was that part of the problem here is Google wasn't just
[00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:29.160]   pointing to the content.
[00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:31.200]   They were hosting the content.
[00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:34.960]   They were drawing the content away from elsewhere, in this case.
[00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:36.360]   And I think that's a danger too.
[00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:40.800]   So yes, a pure API that went beyond just what's in these
[00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:44.040]   comments, but also drew in other comments from elsewhere
[00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:45.200]   that could be viable.
[00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:48.360]   Something's by the way going on at Techorati.
[00:14:48.360 --> 00:14:50.360]   Bob Wyman from Google sent me an email this morning, and I
[00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:51.760]   just looked at their blog.
[00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:55.720]   Their API is going to go out, out, down for six to eight weeks
[00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:58.160]   in October on purpose.
[00:14:58.160 --> 00:14:59.880]   On purpose, what's the point?
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:01.840]   They're doing an extra new version.
[00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:03.720]   Now, why you have to take it down for eight weeks?
[00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:04.440]   Who knows?
[00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:06.280]   And I think some folks are guessing maybe there's yet
[00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:08.040]   another strategy coming from Techorati.
[00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:10.360]   I have no idea.
[00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:10.840]   So--
[00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:11.760]   Interesting.
[00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:16.960]   Somebody in our friend feed conversation pointed out,
[00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:19.680]   I guess, Lila Pan, that it's like something called DeGo.
[00:15:19.680 --> 00:15:22.040]   There are many, many services that do something similar,
[00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:23.520]   allow you to annotate a page.
[00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:24.040]   It's--
[00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:24.960]   Yeah.
[00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:27.920]   But it's not-- because it's not Google, it doesn't have
[00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:29.160]   the same import.
[00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:29.660]   Yeah.
[00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:31.600]   It's like because Google has so much control over what
[00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:33.200]   happens with your site, right?
[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:37.080]   Because they are the point of entry for such a large
[00:15:37.080 --> 00:15:39.400]   percentage of your site's visitors, it's like the idea
[00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:42.960]   of them hosting meta content about the site that anybody can
[00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:44.800]   add to is a little freaky.
[00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:47.960]   A small startup, a separate third party
[00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:51.000]   is not as scary as Google hosting this kind of content.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:54.200]   And are these comments ever going to affect search result
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:55.320]   ranking at some point?
[00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:56.720]   And that kind of thing.
[00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:57.680]   You bet they will.
[00:15:57.680 --> 00:15:57.880]   Yeah.
[00:15:57.880 --> 00:15:59.920]   Because any data that Google can get about a site,
[00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:02.480]   especially they cannot blog with comments.
[00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:06.960]   If it's trying to understand, is this site a spam site
[00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:11.000]   or a good site for working at home money?
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:13.200]   There's a scam going on right now that makes it look as if
[00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:15.160]   you're going to work for Google when you work for home.
[00:16:15.160 --> 00:16:15.660]   Right.
[00:16:15.660 --> 00:16:18.440]   But you have to do is type a lot.
[00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:19.680]   And so that's out there.
[00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:23.760]   So if people of goodwill came along and warned their neighbors
[00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:27.800]   that this is a scam and spam, then I
[00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:31.040]   think that's the good side of what Google's doing.
[00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:33.760]   And then they would use that in their search results.
[00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:34.600]   And that's the good side.
[00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:36.200]   But there's a huge bad side here.
[00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:38.520]   And people can affect each other.
[00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:42.160]   Well, here's a good thing that Google did this week.
[00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:44.640]   They announced that Internet Explorer
[00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:49.160]   would have a new Google frame that you could actually
[00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:53.080]   put Chrome inside IE.
[00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:54.560]   I mean, ask the developer.
[00:16:54.560 --> 00:16:55.640]   What does this mean, Gina?
[00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:56.440]   Oh my god.
[00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:57.720]   I just love this story.
[00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:58.360]   I love the story.
[00:16:58.360 --> 00:16:59.560]   So funny.
[00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:01.440]   Adam and I, Adam Pash and I from Life Hacker.
[00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:03.280]   We were sitting next to another at the Twitter comments
[00:17:03.280 --> 00:17:03.640]   this week.
[00:17:03.640 --> 00:17:04.800]   And he says, oh, look.
[00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:06.000]   There's Chrome frame in IE.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.840]   And I said, I don't understand.
[00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:09.720]   Why would you do this?
[00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:13.440]   Well, Google Wave, a big batch of invitations to Google Wave,
[00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:16.120]   is going out this week on Wednesday or Thursday,
[00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:18.080]   I believe it's October 1.
[00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:20.960]   And the impetus behind Google Chrome frame, which
[00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:23.840]   embeds Chrome's technology, technology inside of Internet
[00:17:23.840 --> 00:17:28.040]   Explorer, is basically the Google Wave team said, we're done.
[00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:30.480]   We're done trying to get Wave to work in Internet Explorer.
[00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:31.600]   We can't do it.
[00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:32.240]   We can't do it.
[00:17:32.240 --> 00:17:33.640]   We've spent hours and hours and hours.
[00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:34.280]   We can't do it.
[00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:35.520]   It doesn't have HTML5.
[00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:37.680]   It can't handle the JavaScript.
[00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:39.560]   There are only so many of us in Google Wave
[00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:40.840]   has lots of issues to work out.
[00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:44.000]   So these engineers need to be working out bugs in modern browsers.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.320]   And they basically said, Internet Explorer just isn't good enough.
[00:17:47.320 --> 00:17:49.320]   If you want to use Wave and Internet Explorer,
[00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:52.040]   you're going to have to install this Chrome frame.
[00:17:52.040 --> 00:17:55.640]   And so Internet Explorer users who want to use Wave will go to Wave
[00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:58.560]   and they'll get a little pop up that says, either install Chrome
[00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:02.640]   frame or switch to Firefox, Chrome, or Safari,
[00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:05.440]   a browser that can handle Wave essentially.
[00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:08.520]   They're basically saying, our web app is just too good for your browser,
[00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:11.120]   which I got to tell you, I feel so bad for the IE folks.
[00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:13.840]   I mean, being one of the IE developers,
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:15.000]   that's just a slap in the face.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:16.480]   You don't want to hear something like that.
[00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:19.080]   Well, don't you think they kind of know?
[00:18:19.080 --> 00:18:21.800]   I mean, well, they've got to know.
[00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:24.840]   They've got to know even IE8 doesn't have--
[00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:27.600]   I mean, these are emerging web technologies, HTML5 and the rest.
[00:18:27.600 --> 00:18:28.840]   They can make a good case.
[00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:31.080]   They could say, look, we're not going to support HTML5 yet.
[00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:32.440]   We're the big guy.
[00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:33.280]   We're the mainstream.
[00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:33.680]   We got to--
[00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:34.760]   They could.
[00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:36.840]   But you know what I kind of love is that Google
[00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:41.320]   made the code, which pops up this little dialogue that says,
[00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:43.040]   you have to install Google Chrome frame.
[00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:43.920]   This is open.
[00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:46.440]   So there's kind of all these web developers that were like,
[00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:49.920]   yay, we don't have to support IE anymore.
[00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:51.480]   We can just pop this thing up.
[00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:54.200]   Oh, so when you come to a page, the page can say,
[00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:55.840]   use Chrome to display this, please.
[00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:56.600]   Yeah, right.
[00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:57.720]   The page can say, please--
[00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:59.200]   Is that seamless for the user?
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:01.040]   The user doesn't know that happened?
[00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:01.960]   Oh, no, no, no, no.
[00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:03.360]   This is-- it adds a whole other step.
[00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:05.560]   You get this pop-up that says, please install Chrome frame,
[00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:07.280]   and you have to click it, and you have to install it.
[00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:08.600]   Now, this is a browser add-on.
[00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:10.720]   So somebody that's like an IT lockdown,
[00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:12.080]   someone who's on a corporate computer,
[00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:14.720]   then they can't install stuff, they're kind of screwed.
[00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:17.080]   So nobody's going to-- no website--
[00:19:17.080 --> 00:19:17.960]   life hacker wouldn't do this.
[00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:19.480]   Smarterware wouldn't do this.
[00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:23.320]   I mean, a website that wants to hit the IE audience
[00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:25.200]   without adding that extra step.
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:27.600]   I mean, this is the thing that I think is just so bold.
[00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:30.760]   I mean, they're adding a major extra step
[00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:37.000]   to a huge percentage of internet users for people to use wave.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:38.560]   It's kind of amazing.
[00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:40.120]   You know, people are saying this is the way
[00:19:40.120 --> 00:19:44.400]   that Google is going to be the IE killer,
[00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:46.240]   that this is going to be the impetus for people
[00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:47.160]   to install Chrome.
[00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:48.640]   I don't know if that's true.
[00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:49.160]   Yeah.
[00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:49.920]   It'll be interesting to see--
[00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:52.240]   Wave is going to be small for a long time, isn't it?
[00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:53.120]   I'm sorry?
[00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:55.280]   Wave's going to be small for a long time, isn't it?
[00:19:55.280 --> 00:19:58.120]   Before it itself gets enough critical mass
[00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:00.080]   to force mortals.
[00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:03.440]   It's people like Neil Dash and Adrian Hall of Audie
[00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:05.360]   say wave's too much for them.
[00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:07.040]   That I think will be a lot of problems.
[00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:07.640]   It is.
[00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:08.120]   It is.
[00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:10.480]   It's forced to Chrome to grow.
[00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:12.880]   Yeah, and I think that's absolutely true.
[00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:16.520]   The time that it takes for regular people to adopt wave,
[00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:18.320]   regular people who use internet explorer
[00:20:18.320 --> 00:20:20.800]   is probably just enough time for the Microsoft
[00:20:20.800 --> 00:20:24.480]   to be able to support it natively.
[00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:27.040]   But in the beginning, it's going to be a small group of users,
[00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:30.040]   many of whom are probably using Firefox or Chrome already.
[00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:31.680]   So I don't think it's going to be that big a deal.
[00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:34.760]   But I still thought it was quite a public slap in the face
[00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:35.920]   for the wave team.
[00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:40.200]   My vision of this is that you see a little tiny Sergey
[00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:42.240]   hand popping out of Steve Ballmer's belly.
[00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:43.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:44.640]   For Haley and--
[00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:46.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:47.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:49.560]   Ooh, I don't know if I like this.
[00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:52.360]   Well, Gina, Steve Ballmer's belly is enough right there.
[00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:54.240]   You don't need Sergey's head for it to be scary.
[00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:57.040]   Gina and I waved at each other because I finally
[00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:59.120]   got from a friendly Googler.
[00:20:59.120 --> 00:20:59.920]   I got a wave.
[00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:01.080]   I got my own Raven.
[00:21:01.080 --> 00:21:02.520]   Hey, how'd you do that?
[00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:03.680]   Never mind.
[00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:06.720]   No, somebody who listens to this show very kindly--
[00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:09.280]   I figure all my pain about "Side Wiki" this week just
[00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:11.280]   june me to get a Raven bite.
[00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:12.520]   No, yeah.
[00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:13.920]   That's it, Jeff, you're out.
[00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:14.880]   Not about.
[00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:17.640]   So Gina, so I tried to chat with Gina.
[00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:18.440]   Yep.
[00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:19.600]   I'm logging on right now.
[00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:21.040]   We have to be on at the same time.
[00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:22.760]   Is that the key?
[00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:25.200]   Yeah, I mean, you don't have to be on the channel.
[00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:26.200]   You can be like email.
[00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:27.360]   It can be asynchronous.
[00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:28.360]   But if you want to have--
[00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:29.200]   Yeah.
[00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:29.800]   But here we are.
[00:21:29.800 --> 00:21:31.800]   So I responded to you earlier in the day.
[00:21:31.800 --> 00:21:33.920]   She said, the trick is we have to both be on the same time
[00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:34.280]   to chat.
[00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:36.000]   I was at the Twitter conference.
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:36.840]   So things were busy.
[00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:39.000]   We should wave during twig and screencast it.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:39.720]   All right.
[00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:41.760]   There's wave.
[00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:42.680]   There's me and Gina.
[00:21:42.680 --> 00:21:44.800]   It's our little wave.
[00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:47.120]   And I know nobody-- this is part of the problem.
[00:21:47.120 --> 00:21:48.840]   If you don't know anybody in Wave,
[00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:50.720]   there's nobody to really talk to.
[00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:51.880]   There's some fun things in here.
[00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:52.440]   Oh, look.
[00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:53.040]   She's typing.
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:55.880]   We can even see your type in real time.
[00:21:55.880 --> 00:22:00.320]   I stay on Facebook when before old folks could get in.
[00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:01.320]   Exactly.
[00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:02.320]   I found the guy--
[00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:04.080]   I said, oh, here I am.
[00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:05.280]   And nobody knew me.
[00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:06.600]   Gina, how do you like it?
[00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:09.760]   Now that you're playing with it.
[00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:10.280]   I like it.
[00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:14.360]   It's still very unstable, especially in Firefox,
[00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:16.160]   which is my primary browser.
[00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:18.480]   I actually-- this got me to install Chrome on my Mac,
[00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:21.160]   which I haven't done up until now.
[00:22:21.160 --> 00:22:23.080]   But I do like it.
[00:22:23.080 --> 00:22:25.240]   It's got lots of potential.
[00:22:25.240 --> 00:22:27.120]   But still not quite stable enough for me
[00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:28.360]   to be logged in all the time.
[00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:30.440]   I'm logging in a little more now because I know Leo
[00:22:30.440 --> 00:22:32.920]   and I know a couple of other people.
[00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:34.960]   So it's going to be a matter of stability
[00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:39.120]   and knowing enough context for it to matter.
[00:22:39.120 --> 00:22:39.800]   Oh, look at it.
[00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:41.360]   So Leo is editing.
[00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:42.520]   Nice.
[00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:47.520]   Well, once I get on, can we use Wave to do the show rundown
[00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:48.560]   and publish from there?
[00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:49.400]   Yeah.
[00:22:49.400 --> 00:22:50.320]   Yeah, let's do that.
[00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:51.640]   I think I'd like to try.
[00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:57.760]   It's my hope to run a Wave server, third party server,
[00:22:57.760 --> 00:23:02.760]   because then you can invite people into it.
[00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:06.640]   With one show, you could have multiple messages around it.
[00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:08.320]   And it would be kind of fun to try it.
[00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:12.640]   I have to say, though, I'm with a Neil.
[00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:15.080]   I don't know really what to do with it.
[00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:15.800]   It's there.
[00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:18.120]   It's working.
[00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:19.680]   You can make polls.
[00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:22.760]   If there's all sorts of bots and stuff you can add to it.
[00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:23.280]   It's cool.
[00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:26.840]   Yeah, one cool feature is that if I type an address
[00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:29.520]   into a Wavelet, I can add a Google Map,
[00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:30.920]   just highlight it and add a Map.
[00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:33.040]   And then if you and I are looking at the Wave at the same time
[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:35.440]   and I start panning and zooming on that map,
[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:37.680]   you see the panning and zooming as it happens.
[00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:38.800]   Oh, that's kind of cool.
[00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:39.400]   Let's try that.
[00:23:39.400 --> 00:23:40.440]   1600.
[00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:41.040]   Let's see here.
[00:23:41.040 --> 00:23:49.200]   I'm going to type in 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue Washington.
[00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:50.400]   I'm not allowed to do that.
[00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:50.720]   I know.
[00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:52.160]   I think it'll be blacked out, won't it?
[00:23:52.160 --> 00:23:53.160]   Let's see.
[00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:54.200]   Let's see what we get.
[00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:56.280]   So does it automatically do it or do I have to put a plug?
[00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:57.360]   Oh, see, it didn't do anything.
[00:23:57.360 --> 00:24:00.000]   Maybe I have to put a plug in or something to have it do that.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:01.720]   Oh, I can't find the map.
[00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:04.080]   Say it's a map address.
[00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:06.200]   There are little bots and stuff.
[00:24:06.200 --> 00:24:06.840]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:09.480]   There's a map point thing somewhere.
[00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:11.200]   G plus.
[00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:11.760]   No.
[00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:12.840]   Oh, well.
[00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:14.400]   Where did it go?
[00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:16.640]   I just got the error message.
[00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:19.960]   All the error messages are from the Joss Whedon show Firefly.
[00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:21.320]   Oh, yes, they are.
[00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:21.920]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:25.640]   So the error message is everything shiny cap, nothing to fret.
[00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:26.920]   I love that.
[00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:28.120]   I love that.
[00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:29.960]   It just shows their total geeks.
[00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:32.640]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:34.160]   Now, I don't know who else is in here.
[00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:37.520]   I also-- there are some rendering issues on Firefox and so
[00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:37.880]   forth.
[00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:42.960]   But I just-- I don't know what else is going on.
[00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:45.200]   So it's interesting.
[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:49.040]   It doesn't crash a lot.
[00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:51.480]   If you stay-- oh, it just crashed at me again.
[00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:52.840]   Yeah, see.
[00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:56.760]   It crashed a lot just frequently.
[00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:57.840]   And the map--
[00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:00.920]   I feel like it's the right brothers.
[00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:03.600]   We're three feet off the ground.
[00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:05.000]   It really is kind of like that.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:06.840]   And the map button is nowhere to be found.
[00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:08.880]   Also, they're obviously-- they're actively working on this.
[00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:12.600]   So things move and chain-- oh, wave map.
[00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:13.520]   Here we go.
[00:25:13.520 --> 00:25:14.680]   Oh, it's wave map.
[00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:16.040]   All right.
[00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:17.000]   Let me go back to our ways.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   Leo, I have to add to this wave.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.080]   This is our wave.
[00:25:22.080 --> 00:25:23.240]   No, that's a different wave.
[00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:23.920]   Where's my--
[00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:26.080]   Yeah, so I just added you to a wave.
[00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:27.160]   A new wave.
[00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:27.880]   Yeah, a new wave.
[00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:31.280]   Sorry about that, which I'm looking at a map of Australia,
[00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:33.560]   which is what it defaults to because the Google Wave team
[00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:35.560]   is based in Australia.
[00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:37.040]   Now, OK.
[00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:39.040]   Dc in your inbox.
[00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:42.080]   It's really my inbox, huh?
[00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:44.160]   At the bottom, presumably, is the newest thing.
[00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:48.360]   I should show up at the top.
[00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:49.320]   Or at the top.
[00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:50.840]   Welcome to the wave.
[00:25:50.840 --> 00:25:54.920]   It's just-- I think the title is ASDF.
[00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:55.640]   There it is.
[00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:56.760]   I see it now.
[00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:57.680]   All right.
[00:25:57.680 --> 00:25:59.160]   And there's the plug-in and it's loading.
[00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:00.280]   And there's the map.
[00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:01.520]   That's neat.
[00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:03.320]   Oh, that's cool.
[00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:05.960]   And so when you do something to the map, I see it.
[00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:07.360]   Yes.
[00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:10.160]   Actually, try to load it here.
[00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:13.160]   Yeah.
[00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:15.400]   If you know exactly what you're doing,
[00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:17.560]   and you constrain it, the demo is quite entertaining.
[00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:21.880]   However, if you're just messing around, it's kind of--
[00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:22.800]   it doesn't--
[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:25.520]   Yeah, it's not a smooth user experience.
[00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:28.000]   I mean, they launch this for developers
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.600]   to build bots to have things ready for it.
[00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:33.320]   But really, this is not a user preview.
[00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:34.080]   Now, I don't know--
[00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:37.640]   100,000 people are going to be waving in about three or four
[00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:38.360]   days.
[00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:38.880]   Yeah.
[00:26:38.880 --> 00:26:39.240]   Yeah.
[00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:40.600]   So I don't know.
[00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:41.800]   Hopefully, I don't know if there'll
[00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:43.080]   be a new build that they're going to release,
[00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:44.880]   if it's going to be a new server, because this
[00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:47.440]   is the developer sandbox that we're on right now.
[00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:48.760]   But it'll be interesting to see.
[00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:50.080]   It's an exciting day, Wednesday.
[00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:50.560]   Yep.
[00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:51.560]   Yep.
[00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:52.200]   All right.
[00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:53.400]   We're going to talk more about Google.
[00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:56.360]   Regina Trapani is here from smarterware.org, her tip
[00:26:56.360 --> 00:26:57.280]   of the week coming up.
[00:26:57.280 --> 00:27:00.640]   Jeff's number of the week and just a bit my tool of the week.
[00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:04.480]   And I regret to report Civa will not be joining us.
[00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:07.960]   He had an emergency and cannot make it today.
[00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:08.760]   But that's fine.
[00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:10.200]   We'll get him on another time.
[00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:11.520]   There is news with the Google Book Deal.
[00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:12.520]   And we'll get that in for you.
[00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:15.960]   But I want to briefly mention our friends at audible.com.
[00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:17.720]   We know Jeff loves Audible because they've
[00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:18.760]   got his book in there.
[00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:21.000]   And my books came out before there were audio books.
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:23.360]   In fact, I think my books came out before there was paper.
[00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:24.200]   Stone tablets.
[00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:24.880]   Stone tablets.
[00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:25.480]   Yeah.
[00:27:25.480 --> 00:27:28.880]   So there are no audiobooks of my stuff.
[00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:32.080]   Audiblepodcast.com/twig is the place to go, though.
[00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:33.320]   And you can find all sorts--
[00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:40.240]   60,000 wonderful titles, all kinds of books
[00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:42.600]   about all sorts of subjects-- fiction and nonfiction
[00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:46.440]   history, science fiction, romance.
[00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:48.920]   If you go there right now, sign up for a gold account

[00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:56.520]   Richard Dawkins has a new one.
[00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:58.680]   I'm a big Richard Dawkins fan.
[00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:01.320]   His newest is called The Greatest Show on Earth,
[00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:03.160]   the Evidence for Evolution.
[00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:06.920]   And he is definitely a polarizing person.
[00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:09.400]   But one of the, I think, the best science writers I know
[00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:12.800]   and a really good science writer on this particular subject,
[00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:15.400]   his book's The Blind Watchmaker and The Selfish Gene,
[00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:19.560]   really talk about evolution in a new and fresh and interesting
[00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:20.880]   way.
[00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:22.920]   The Greatest Show on Earth, The Evidence for Evolution.
[00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:26.720]   If you like science reading, a really fantastic place
[00:28:26.720 --> 00:28:28.080]   for science.
[00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:29.680]   But you get your first one free.
[00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:33.080]   So go to audiblepodcast.com/twig.
[00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:34.040]   Now, here's the cool thing.
[00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:37.520]   When you find a book you like, you click download.
[00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:38.800]   And within a minute or two, you'll
[00:28:38.800 --> 00:28:42.560]   have the entire book, every word, just like it was published.
[00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:45.520]   But it read to you-- and not just read to you by a machine,
[00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:50.560]   but read to you by somebody who can really make a book come
[00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:52.640]   to life.
[00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:54.720]   This is better than your mommy reading to you.
[00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:59.520]   This is professional actors who are just brilliant.
[00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:03.240]   Or they're Jeff Jarvis, if you listen to what would Google do.
[00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:04.600]   Sometimes they use the author.
[00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:09.160]   And a lot of times, the author has an insight into it
[00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:11.760]   that really, really brings it to life.
[00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:12.160]   So I--
[00:29:12.160 --> 00:29:15.160]   And put two producers on me because I speak to them fast.
[00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:17.160]   And that's all they were saying to me when I read.
[00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:19.360]   I read a short story and they kept saying, slow down.
[00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:20.000]   Slow down.
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.960]   Slow down.
[00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:24.280]   Audiblepodcast.com/twig.
[00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:24.920]   Try it right now.
[00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:26.480]   Your first book is free.
[00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:29.360]   Great way to keep up if you're in the car.
[00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:32.240]   If you're at the gym, wherever you can't hold a book,
[00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:33.680]   you can read a book.
[00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:34.440]   Thanks to Audible.
[00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:35.120]   We really love them.
[00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:36.280]   We hope you'll enjoy them.

[00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:43.080]   Google had another outage, Gmail out again.
[00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:47.080]   And Omalek took this opportunity to say,
[00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:48.760]   this shows you, you'll never--
[00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:50.600]   these online things will never work.
[00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:52.640]   The cloud is dead.
[00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:54.200]   I feel like this is deja vu.
[00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:55.760]   Yeah, we just had this conversation.
[00:29:55.760 --> 00:29:57.720]   Yeah, we're going to have this conversation a lot.
[00:29:57.720 --> 00:29:59.960]   Yeah, the cloud will never be perfect,
[00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:02.480]   but how often does your corporate email go down?
[00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:03.680]   I mean, email goes down.
[00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:05.120]   Its websites go down.
[00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:07.520]   Servers go down.
[00:30:07.520 --> 00:30:11.760]   I think you responded, didn't you, Jeff, to Omalek?
[00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:12.520]   No, I didn't.
[00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:13.800]   Somebody, I thought you did.
[00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:14.200]   Maybe it was--
[00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:14.960]   I shrugged.
[00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:15.480]   You shrugged.
[00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:17.200]   What are you going to say?
[00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:17.840]   I love them.
[00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:18.360]   I love them.
[00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:19.000]   But that's--
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.160]   Yeah, I remember Gina saying last time that I worked on IMAP.
[00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:23.240]   So I was on my iPhone and my IMAP worked.
[00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:24.520]   And so I was happy.
[00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:25.520]   Right.
[00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:27.520]   Awesome.
[00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:30.400]   Hey, there's that big cyanogen story I'd love to talk about.
[00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:30.880]   Oh, yeah.
[00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:33.040]   And we were going to get the developer on.
[00:30:33.040 --> 00:30:35.680]   And we'll keep working on getting him on.
[00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:39.000]   This is your tip last week for hacking your iPhone,
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:40.680]   or your Google phone, I should say.
[00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:44.280]   Yeah, last week I featured the cyanogen mod, which
[00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:48.480]   is a custom Android build that you can flash onto your Android
[00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:48.920]   phone.
[00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:50.280]   I'm using a G1.
[00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:53.320]   And add some new features from the Donut tree, which
[00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:55.120]   is the upcoming update.
[00:30:55.120 --> 00:30:58.160]   And also gives you a little more access to the root file
[00:30:58.160 --> 00:30:58.680]   system.
[00:30:58.680 --> 00:30:59.600]   So it gives you root access.
[00:30:59.600 --> 00:31:02.040]   So you can install other applications that
[00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:04.720]   require root access, like a tethering app.
[00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:08.160]   I've been running the cyanogen mod since for two weeks now,
[00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:09.600]   and I absolutely love it.
[00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:12.640]   And something really sad and upsetting happened this week.
[00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:17.280]   Google sent a cyanogen, who's the developer, a cease and desist
[00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:20.840]   letter, and asked them to stop distributing the mod.
[00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:23.800]   And the reason is they said that even though Android--
[00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:25.320]   and this is how I understand it--
[00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:28.920]   even though Android, the operating system, is open source,
[00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:31.000]   there are several closed source applications
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.800]   that come with it, like the Gmail client, like the Market
[00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:37.400]   client, like Google Maps.
[00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:39.920]   So they're basically saying-- and to Google's credit,
[00:31:39.920 --> 00:31:43.440]   they did a post in the Android Developers blog about this.
[00:31:43.440 --> 00:31:47.400]   So at first I was upset that they sent them a CND.
[00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:48.880]   Before you get the lawyers involved,
[00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:51.920]   it often just helps to do a little outreach.
[00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:54.280]   But they did a post on the Android Developers blog
[00:31:54.280 --> 00:31:56.560]   explaining the situation and saying that, I'm not sure
[00:31:56.560 --> 00:31:58.520]   exactly how this works, but they basically
[00:31:58.520 --> 00:32:00.920]   have business deals that involve distributing
[00:32:00.920 --> 00:32:04.280]   these kinds of special apps on a per provider basis.
[00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:08.520]   So you can't redistribute a custom Android build
[00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:09.920]   with these closed apps.
[00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:13.920]   And cyanogen's point is the ROM is basically
[00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:15.680]   dead at this point because it's useless
[00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:18.520]   without, for example, the market app,
[00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:21.120]   because then you can't install applications
[00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:23.560]   or the Gmail client or the Maps client.
[00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:26.520]   I mean, no one would want to install it at that point.
[00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:27.360]   So it's a bummer.
[00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:29.200]   I'm really bummed out about it.
[00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:32.240]   I see Google's point.
[00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:34.760]   I wasn't aware of the nuance that there's
[00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:35.720]   a difference between them.
[00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:39.800]   I didn't realize that those client apps were closed source.
[00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:42.240]   Cyanogen said that it's a chilling effect.
[00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:45.080]   The CND is a chilling effect on whole ROM development
[00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:45.880]   community.
[00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:48.360]   He's not trying to compete with Google
[00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:51.160]   or screw up any of their business deals.
[00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:52.440]   It's just kind of a bummer.
[00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:54.240]   As a developer, I can tell you, you only
[00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:56.240]   develop on platforms that you love.
[00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:59.000]   It's the ultimate way to pay homage to something that you love.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.080]   And that's what he's doing.
[00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:03.360]   And this is such a small percentage of Android users
[00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:05.960]   are actually going to install a custom build.
[00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:07.240]   It's just a bummer that it has to stop.
[00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:11.520]   So I tried to get Cyanogen on to do an interview today.
[00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:14.040]   And he doesn't want to screw up his relationship with Google.
[00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:15.240]   He doesn't want to say anything.
[00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:15.840]   He regrets.
[00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:17.960]   And I think the last thing that he said on Twitter
[00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:19.720]   was, I'm still just so disgusted.
[00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:24.240]   And he said, I'm not sure if I'm ready to do an interview yet.
[00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:24.920]   I'm disgusted.
[00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:25.960]   I put so much work into this.
[00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:28.800]   I'm really upset about how this turned out.
[00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:31.880]   There is a discussion going on in the Android developers
[00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:34.480]   Google group about the possibility
[00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:37.360]   of making open source alternatives to the closed source
[00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:43.160]   apps in order to make distributing custom ROMs kosher
[00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:43.760]   in the future.
[00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:45.040]   But that's going to take some work.
[00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:47.320]   And right now, this guy put a lot of work into this.
[00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:49.040]   And it's just a bummer.
[00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:51.080]   You know, I understand Google's point of view.
[00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:52.880]   And I think that they didn't probably have any choice.
[00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:54.800]   They may not have handled it properly.
[00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:55.840]   It'd be nice to have called him.
[00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:58.800]   But I can see why they said, look,
[00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:01.520]   we can't open source Gmail.
[00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:01.960]   Right.
[00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:02.640]   Well, yeah.
[00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:04.200]   Well, it's the Gmail client.
[00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:08.520]   It's the native Gmail client, which really
[00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:10.440]   is the best part of Android, as far as I'm concerned.
[00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:13.160]   It's one of the main reasons why I switched over from the iPhone.
[00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:15.000]   It's push.
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:16.960]   And it's just a fantastic email client,
[00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:19.200]   especially with the G1.
[00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:22.040]   But maps in the market, you just don't have no conduit.
[00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:23.400]   You have no way to get applications
[00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:24.720]   if you don't have the market app.
[00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:25.200]   Right.
[00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:25.680]   So--
[00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:26.200]   Yeah.
[00:34:26.200 --> 00:34:29.000]   So he couldn't then strip out those contested things
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:31.880]   and still put out a ROM, because nobody would want it.
[00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:33.240]   There'd be no use for it.
[00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:37.120]   Well, there would be no way to install other applications
[00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:38.400]   without the market app.
[00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:40.240]   And you'd have to write a zone market app.
[00:34:40.240 --> 00:34:41.000]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:41.680]   They would have-- right.
[00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:43.400]   He'd have to write his own market app.
[00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:45.560]   They'd have to rewrite essentially these closed source
[00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:49.320]   apps in order for people to get on it and download it.
[00:34:49.320 --> 00:34:52.200]   And for reasons I don't quite understand,
[00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:55.360]   someone asked the developer, well, hey, I bought the G1
[00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:57.280]   from T-Mobile.
[00:34:57.280 --> 00:34:59.680]   That means I have a license to these closed source apps.
[00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:02.400]   If I install your ROM, can I just move them over
[00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:05.680]   from my original install or download them again?
[00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:06.880]   Don't I have the right to do that?
[00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:09.200]   And he said no.
[00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:12.680]   And I'm not really sure why that is.
[00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:14.160]   So it sucks.
[00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:14.660]   It sucks.
[00:35:14.660 --> 00:35:16.420]   I mean, the good news is that Google is being
[00:35:16.420 --> 00:35:17.440]   communicative about this.
[00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:20.280]   And there are developers on the team that feel bad about it.
[00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:22.580]   I mean, they want-- they're riding on the backs of--
[00:35:22.580 --> 00:35:25.360]   they want developers to love Android and develop for it.
[00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:28.600]   They don't want to stop this, but it's just kind of the state
[00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:29.520]   and the state right now.
[00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:32.840]   So I'm wondering-- I mean, this is such a small use case.
[00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:35.040]   I don't know if these closed source apps are going
[00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:38.240]   to get open source alternatives that are just as good.
[00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:39.740]   I'm not sure how this is going to shake out.
[00:35:39.740 --> 00:35:43.560]   But I hope it turns out well, because this ROM is really cool.
[00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:44.040]   I love it.
[00:35:44.040 --> 00:35:46.020]   And I'd just hate to see it die this way.
[00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:47.420]   Yeah.
[00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:50.220]   Yeah, in fact, if you already have the ROM,
[00:35:50.220 --> 00:35:51.340]   could you still install it?
[00:35:51.340 --> 00:35:53.860]   I mean, he can't offer it for download.
[00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:57.420]   But I know that-- I know some people who still have the--
[00:35:57.420 --> 00:35:57.940]   fine.
[00:35:57.940 --> 00:35:59.100]   Yeah, right.
[00:35:59.100 --> 00:35:59.580]   Right.
[00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:00.100]   Yeah.
[00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:01.340]   So he's not supposed to distribute it.
[00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:02.900]   Others could do so.
[00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:05.100]   Others could probably do so.
[00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:05.860]   Yeah.
[00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:08.020]   I mean, this could get sticky.
[00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:09.780]   But yeah, I believe so.
[00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:11.860]   Google-- and I'm ignorant as hell about this.
[00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:14.360]   So Google basically create a version of what he did
[00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:17.280]   to get the same benefit that keeps them in control
[00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:18.760]   over what they need to be controlled.
[00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:21.040]   Why would Google want to do that?
[00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:24.120]   To get the developers developing.
[00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:25.280]   So I don't understand.
[00:36:25.280 --> 00:36:27.440]   You can be a developer for Android, can't you,
[00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:29.840]   without the cyanogen ROMs?
[00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:30.240]   Or no?
[00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:34.440]   Yeah, the cyanogen mod is just a particular custom Android
[00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:38.400]   build that he threw in a couple of extra features,
[00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:41.760]   some things from Donut, a couple of apps
[00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:45.280]   that require root access, which cyanogen mod gives you.
[00:36:45.280 --> 00:36:48.280]   So the root access issue is probably not something
[00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:52.000]   that Google is going to distribute to everyone.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:53.400]   Let's you do things that--
[00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:58.340]   I'm not even sure if tethering-- using root access,
[00:36:58.340 --> 00:36:58.840]   for example.
[00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:00.560]   So there's a tethering app that you
[00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:01.480]   have to have to root access.
[00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:04.740]   I'm not even really sure if that's kosher,
[00:37:04.740 --> 00:37:06.720]   if that's even OK.
[00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:11.200]   So the issue is that somebody can't--
[00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:12.240]   it's not a fork.
[00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:15.360]   I don't believe it's a proper fork of the Android project,
[00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:17.760]   but it's just a custom build.
[00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:20.520]   This kind of makes the whole community around custom builds.
[00:37:20.520 --> 00:37:21.720]   And there is a whole community.
[00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:23.120]   There are tons of different ROMs.
[00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:25.800]   Cyanogen is one of the most popular and most well-known.
[00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:29.120]   And I believe he's the first one to get the C&D.
[00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:32.480]   It just stops that whole thing.
[00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:34.360]   It sounds like more-- it's a question
[00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:36.320]   of brokenhearted developers who thought
[00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:38.600]   that Android really was an open source project.
[00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:40.520]   And in fact, it's not.
[00:37:40.520 --> 00:37:41.240]   This is the thing.
[00:37:41.240 --> 00:37:42.480]   This is why I'm heartbroken about this.
[00:37:42.480 --> 00:37:43.760]   It feels like such an Apple move.
[00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:45.840]   Like I was just like, I love my Android phone
[00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:47.080]   for all these philosophical reasons.
[00:37:47.080 --> 00:37:47.840]   It's open source.
[00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:48.960]   And people can do what they want.
[00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:52.320]   But it's not-- it's not totally open.
[00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:53.840]   Not the client apps.
[00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:56.400]   Not all the apps that run on Android are open
[00:37:56.400 --> 00:38:01.160]   and can be freely redistributed, which is the bummer.
[00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:03.360]   You could still hack Android.
[00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:06.840]   You just can't make a mashup ROM.
[00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:09.760]   Right, you can't redistribute a full build.
[00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:11.520]   But you could send out--
[00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:14.400]   You could send out, for instance, root access patch.
[00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:17.280]   Ah, yes.
[00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:18.520]   I'm not sure if that's true.
[00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:19.800]   I'm not sure.
[00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:21.080]   I think that--
[00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:22.720]   You might have to change the entire ROM
[00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:23.560]   to make that possible.
[00:38:23.560 --> 00:38:24.160]   This is the thing.
[00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:26.200]   I think this is why this ROM exists, right?
[00:38:26.200 --> 00:38:28.120]   Because I don't believe that you could just send an update
[00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:30.520]   to the existing build that you would get on your phone
[00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:33.120]   and get root access.
[00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:34.360]   And why do we want root access?
[00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:37.400]   If we have root access, we can do more different stuff.
[00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:39.040]   Yeah, you get a little more control.
[00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:40.920]   One of the biggest things that you can do
[00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:43.960]   is you can tether, for example.
[00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:47.080]   Now, there's an app that lets you tether called PDANet.
[00:38:47.080 --> 00:38:49.400]   Through your USB cable, you don't need a custom ROM
[00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:50.000]   to use that.
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:51.320]   And that does work.
[00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:54.400]   But you have to install this Windows utility on your PC
[00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:56.680]   and the phone has to be connected.
[00:38:56.680 --> 00:39:00.440]   This other tether app that you need root access for,
[00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:02.440]   you literally just tap the phone
[00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:05.040]   and then suddenly you have a Wi-Fi point wherever you are.
[00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:06.000]   It's kind of like a Wi-Fi.
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:09.800]   It turns into a Wi-Fi, then you can get online.
[00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:11.440]   So part of me feels a little bad about--
[00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:13.160]   Not much used to me because I'm on T-Mobile.
[00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:16.280]   And there's no reason why I would want T-Mobile high speed
[00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:17.560]   access.
[00:39:17.560 --> 00:39:18.200]   Cool.
[00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:19.080]   High speed access.
[00:39:19.080 --> 00:39:21.680]   Right, high speed, right, exactly.
[00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:22.800]   Well, it's a shame.
[00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:24.920]   But I think in some ways it's a coming of age.
[00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:30.480]   It's a realization that it's not a fully open source project.
[00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:30.840]   Right.
[00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:34.040]   Not all the components of it are open source, only the operating
[00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:34.560]   system.
[00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:36.680]   And just to say, tethering is the only thing
[00:39:36.680 --> 00:39:38.000]   you can do with root access.
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:39.720]   You also have a terminal.
[00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:41.560]   You have access to the file system on--
[00:39:41.560 --> 00:39:42.880]   It's an operating system.
[00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:45.480]   It becomes like full on operating system
[00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:46.880]   with less protection.
[00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:49.400]   I mean, you can obviously also really screw up your phone
[00:39:49.400 --> 00:39:52.080]   if you don't know what you're doing and you have root access.
[00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:53.800]   But for more advanced users, the people who
[00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:56.160]   are more likely to install this ROM--
[00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:57.800]   And these are the people that are the most--
[00:39:57.800 --> 00:39:59.840]   that love Android the most, that are the most loyal.
[00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:01.320]   And the people who are out there saying,
[00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:04.400]   hey, there's an alternative to iPhone.
[00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:06.840]   This is why they're shooting themselves in the foot.
[00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:09.480]   And this is why I really hope that they can come to a compromise
[00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:12.040]   that allows the customer, the customer
[00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:16.800]   on community to do what they do without this kind of issue.
[00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:18.920]   Yeah.
[00:40:18.920 --> 00:40:21.560]   So Jeff's book, What Would Google Do?
[00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:22.960]   Now Jeff has to do a rewrite.
[00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:24.240]   What Would Google Buy?
[00:40:24.240 --> 00:40:28.760]   That was his subtitle to the news that Google's back
[00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:31.440]   on the market, baby.
[00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:35.080]   Eric Schmidt says, the acquisitions are back on.
[00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:38.400]   How long have they gone without buying anything?
[00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:39.400]   You know, I don't know.
[00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:40.640]   And I think they bought little stuff.
[00:40:40.640 --> 00:40:42.440]   But I think the interesting question to me
[00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:44.000]   is what should they buy?
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:45.840]   Right.
[00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:50.400]   So Schmidt was at an event in Pittsburgh.
[00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:56.560]   He says, we got $19 billion in cash and short-term investments.
[00:40:56.560 --> 00:41:01.840]   We're going to try to buy some small company every month.
[00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:04.160]   And they have.
[00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:05.920]   Because we know about On To.
[00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:08.960]   We know about ReCAPTCHA.
[00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:11.880]   I guess my question would be, is how is Google's track record
[00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:12.840]   on these acquisitions?
[00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:17.080]   I mean, I think of acquisitions like Dodgeball and Jaiku,
[00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:19.920]   which really didn't go anywhere.
[00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:22.400]   I mean, I don't know if Google feels like they got their money's
[00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:22.720]   worth.
[00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:24.240]   Clearly, they didn't with Dodgeball.
[00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:26.880]   The team's left and gone on to create something, actually,
[00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:27.600]   of some real value.
[00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:29.040]   But then there's YouTube.
[00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:31.080]   They say we'll be profitable shortly.
[00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:33.760]   Blogger, I think, cost them a-- yeah, I know, any day.
[00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:35.960]   The second Tuesday of next week is they say it with me.
[00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:41.760]   Blogger taught them a lot.
[00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:46.240]   I just saw the other day that the successor to Jot Spot,
[00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:50.040]   or the Google Sites, is finally added in API.
[00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:52.800]   A lot of times they are hiring the staff on.
[00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:55.240]   Feedburner, I think they lost some of the best people
[00:41:55.240 --> 00:41:58.600]   there at Dick Costolo was great.
[00:41:58.600 --> 00:42:01.080]   So the problem with all these big companies when they buy.
[00:42:01.080 --> 00:42:03.960]   But then again, they also know the limits of their own development.
[00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:08.360]   And it's a way to get in new functions and new--
[00:42:08.360 --> 00:42:12.080]   then again, Wave comes from a purchase of smart people
[00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:13.800]   in Australia.
[00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:16.360]   And a lot of the great map things have come from buying
[00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:17.440]   companies to hire talent.
[00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:19.520]   The Rasmussen.
[00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:22.760]   And so it's the argument of it's an acquire.
[00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:24.840]   You're doing it to hire not to acquire.
[00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:26.440]   So what should Google buy?
[00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:31.400]   More cloud stuff, small web 2.0 companies.
[00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:32.160]   In my suggestion--
[00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:34.000]   My suggestion this week was after the decide
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:35.600]   wiki mask was Techorati.
[00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:38.760]   Yeah, maybe.
[00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:41.960]   That would be interesting, huh?
[00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:44.080]   It's about organizing content.
[00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:45.000]   Right.
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:45.840]   Wouldn't be insane.
[00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:48.280]   And they need a strategy.
[00:42:48.280 --> 00:42:51.120]   I wonder somebody-- I'd love to see somebody do a rundown
[00:42:51.120 --> 00:42:53.840]   of acquisitions versus 20% projects.
[00:42:53.840 --> 00:42:58.840]   So like Gmail, Google Reader, maybe Docs were 20% projects.
[00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:01.640]   What are Google's most successful projects?
[00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:04.480]   How many of them are acquisitions versus the 20% time?
[00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:04.680]   Yeah.
[00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:05.880]   I was going to-- if I'd had time, I
[00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:06.880]   would have loved to have done this.
[00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:08.720]   List all the acquisitions.
[00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:10.560]   List all the projects.
[00:43:10.560 --> 00:43:12.480]   And list success and failures.
[00:43:12.480 --> 00:43:13.520]   And just kind of get a sense.
[00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:15.120]   I'm sure internally they know.
[00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:18.560]   But a sense of how well they do with third party stuff
[00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:22.800]   in incorporating it compared to stuff that's already
[00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:26.040]   generated at Google, whether these acquisitions have paid out.
[00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:27.160]   I mean, double click.
[00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:30.400]   I would say double click was a big acquisition
[00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:33.080]   that presumably meant money for them.
[00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:34.960]   Wasn't Google Analytics an acquisition?
[00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:35.800]   Say again?
[00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:37.480]   Google Analytics wasn't that an acquisition.
[00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:38.040]   It was.
[00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:38.520]   That's right.
[00:43:38.520 --> 00:43:39.520]   It was.
[00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:42.560]   I think they've done a lot better than AOL and Yahoo.
[00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:43.600]   Well, that's not--
[00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:45.040]   That's not saying much.
[00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:45.920]   And they did well.
[00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:47.400]   It's just better than.
[00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:48.920]   It's a hard thing to do.
[00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:50.920]   And yet for growth, they probably
[00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:51.880]   can't do it all internally.
[00:43:51.880 --> 00:43:54.400]   They need to acquire to continue to growth.
[00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:55.400]   Bro.
[00:43:55.400 --> 00:44:04.000]   Fennel, I think if they concentrate on the talent,
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.360]   that's where they've succeeded best.
[00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:07.880]   You know, you write, double click's a little different.
[00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:09.760]   Double click is really about a business strategy.
[00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:11.920]   And they just announced-- we talked about it last week.
[00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:15.120]   They're going into display ads and can
[00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:16.440]   bring new value to that.
[00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:18.720]   And that's important for the entire media industry.
[00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:21.800]   But that was a mature bought company.
[00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:23.040]   There's a great graphic.
[00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:25.400]   I can't find it on this part of the moment that
[00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:28.960]   shows all the Google acquisitions as a Metro map,
[00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:31.760]   as a subway map, that all the stops and all the lines
[00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:33.120]   and where they've done it.
[00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:36.080]   Speaking of Yahoo, they're getting a little heat
[00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:38.800]   because they've started a brand flicker as a Yahoo.
[00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:40.240]   I don't know why this would bug people.
[00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:42.160]   But for some-- people are very--
[00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:47.000]   Yahoo is very adamant about Yahoo and about flicker,
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:47.520]   I should say.
[00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:48.640]   And flickers cool.
[00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:49.960]   Yahoo's not.
[00:44:49.960 --> 00:44:54.120]   In fact, Carol Bartz had a great quote saying,
[00:44:54.120 --> 00:44:55.120]   what was it?
[00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:57.720]   Why do you guys all think Google's so cool and Yahoo's not?
[00:44:57.720 --> 00:44:58.360]   Would you please?
[00:44:58.360 --> 00:44:59.960]   You're getting on my nerves here.
[00:44:59.960 --> 00:45:00.480]   I can't remember.
[00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:01.920]   I have to find the exact quote.
[00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:03.840]   But it's very funny.
[00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:06.200]   People are unhappy about the fact that they've put flicker
[00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:07.920]   by Yahoo.
[00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:08.560]   Here's the quote.
[00:45:08.560 --> 00:45:10.800]   This is Carol Bartz, Yahoo CEO.
[00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:12.840]   When you get outside New York at Silicon Valley,
[00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:14.320]   everyone loves Yahoo.
[00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:16.760]   I just want to transplant all you guys out of your citizens.
[00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:18.080]   And what's wrong with you guys?
[00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:20.000]   Go be cynical about fricking Google.
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:22.280]   You get me pissed off.
[00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:25.320]   Now that's a CEO I can like.
[00:45:25.320 --> 00:45:28.560]   I have a post from two years ago complaining about Yahoo
[00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:30.840]   mail killing my account if I didn't use it.
[00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:34.800]   And to this day, I get new comments every week.
[00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:36.400]   I don't think they love Yahoo out there.
[00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:42.360]   And the fact that Yahoo-- we're going to hear that damned Yahoo.
[00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:43.600]   Oh, God.
[00:45:43.600 --> 00:45:47.400]   Because they're spending $100 million on advertising.
[00:45:47.400 --> 00:45:49.240]   What does that tell you?
[00:45:49.240 --> 00:45:50.680]   People don't love Yahoo.
[00:45:50.680 --> 00:45:51.520]   No, you're right.
[00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:53.440]   If they did, they wouldn't have to.
[00:45:53.440 --> 00:45:54.680]   It looks like a community.
[00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:55.800]   There I say, Google.
[00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:57.360]   Here's a map from a tech crunch.
[00:45:57.360 --> 00:45:59.760]   Thanks to our chat room for sending this along.
[00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:01.400]   It's based on the New York subway map.
[00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:03.280]   The New York subway map.
[00:46:03.280 --> 00:46:05.760]   And it shows all the Google acquisitions
[00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:09.920]   and holy cow, the colors are technology, web services,
[00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:12.600]   mapping, imaging, search, social video, advertising,
[00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:14.200]   VoIP and news.
[00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:17.240]   And really, there's quite a bit of stuff here.
[00:46:17.240 --> 00:46:21.640]   Urchin became analytics.
[00:46:21.640 --> 00:46:24.360]   Keyhole, which led into their mapping.
[00:46:24.360 --> 00:46:26.280]   Picasa.
[00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:26.840]   Oh, yeah.
[00:46:26.840 --> 00:46:27.520]   Picasa.
[00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:28.520]   Picasa, you can't forget.
[00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:31.640]   YouTube and DoubleClick, of course, very big acquisitions.
[00:46:31.640 --> 00:46:35.720]   But there are a lot of little ones on here along the way.
[00:46:35.720 --> 00:46:38.840]   It's a Grand Central was an acquisition.
[00:46:38.840 --> 00:46:39.440]   Oh, yes.
[00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:41.880]   Google Voice.
[00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:43.240]   Jot Spot.
[00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:45.680]   Postini.
[00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:46.480]   Very interesting.
[00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:47.000]   Postini.
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:47.520]   Postini.
[00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:49.120]   Yeah.
[00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:50.720]   Somehow, I don't know how this happened.
[00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:52.360]   It looks like AOL is on this map.
[00:46:52.360 --> 00:46:54.760]   I don't think-- did Google buy AOL and I missed that?
[00:46:54.760 --> 00:46:56.240]   OK, Google invested a lot in AOL.
[00:46:56.240 --> 00:46:57.520]   They bought into.
[00:46:57.520 --> 00:46:58.280]   OK.
[00:46:58.280 --> 00:46:59.840]   OK.
[00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:00.960]   But you know, I'm worried about Flickr.
[00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:02.960]   The Flickr community is particularly
[00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:04.960]   possessive of that place.
[00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:05.360]   Yeah.
[00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:05.860]   Yeah.
[00:47:05.860 --> 00:47:07.600]   I mean, I developed Firefox add-ons.
[00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:10.400]   I did some for Gmail, one for Google Calendar.
[00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:12.280]   I've done one for YouTube, one for Flickr.
[00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:15.920]   It was the Flickr one that people reacted the most strongly
[00:47:15.920 --> 00:47:20.040]   to were, you know, I got a lot of upset email about--
[00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:20.760]   Really?
[00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:21.200]   Yeah.
[00:47:21.200 --> 00:47:21.640]   Yeah.
[00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:23.720]   It was interesting.
[00:47:23.720 --> 00:47:25.560]   I think that there's just a sense of ownership there.
[00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:26.360]   It's a great community.
[00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:27.920]   Flickr is one of the social websites
[00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:31.200]   that I have been loyal to for years now.
[00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:32.240]   It's really great.
[00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:34.560]   I get to watch all my friends, kids grow up.
[00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:35.560]   I love Flickr.
[00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:36.240]   Yeah.
[00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:36.760]   Yeah.
[00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:37.840]   It's a great site.
[00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:40.000]   I think-- yeah, who's losing a lot of money on Flickr?
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:42.200]   I think it's like YouTube, a big bandwidth hog,
[00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:44.200]   and they haven't really figured out a way to monetize it.
[00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:45.360]   There's no ads on it.
[00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:47.600]   In fact, really, the only way they're making money on it
[00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:49.080]   is you can buy prints.
[00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:50.720]   Does anybody buy prints on Flickr?
[00:47:50.720 --> 00:47:52.200]   I don't think so.
[00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:54.600]   I went the last time you bought a calendar on Flickr.
[00:47:54.600 --> 00:47:57.160]   I have a pro account, and I actually have ordered--
[00:47:57.160 --> 00:47:59.560]   I have ordered prints and stuff, but I think--
[00:47:59.560 --> 00:48:01.600]   like I said, I love the product.
[00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:03.440]   I think they may be running small ads.
[00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:05.840]   I think they have some sponsorships from camera makers.
[00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:06.840]   Oh, OK.
[00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:07.360]   Yeah.
[00:48:07.360 --> 00:48:08.360]   Yeah.
[00:48:08.360 --> 00:48:11.120]   Actually, I think that Yahoo has done a fine job with Flickr.
[00:48:11.120 --> 00:48:13.120]   I don't think that it's changed or degraded
[00:48:13.120 --> 00:48:13.880]   since the acquisition.
[00:48:13.880 --> 00:48:15.400]   You don't hear as much about it.
[00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:18.040]   It's not quite as hip and cool as it used to be.
[00:48:18.040 --> 00:48:20.480]   It used to feel like this thing that no one knew about,
[00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:21.960]   and it feels like everyone knows about it now.
[00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:23.120]   But I still use it.
[00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:24.880]   It's a great UI.
[00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:28.480]   Well, it's also the biggest photo community after Facebook.
[00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:29.320]   I mean, it's really--
[00:48:29.320 --> 00:48:29.880]   Yeah.
[00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:30.360]   Yeah.
[00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:32.200]   There's the Flickr from Yahoo.
[00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:33.280]   I could see my other bug.
[00:48:33.280 --> 00:48:35.640]   That would bug people a little bit.
[00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:39.440]   It's the Yahoo saying, don't forget Flickr from Yahoo.
[00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:42.480]   And the new branding, Jeff, the Yahoo branding
[00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:46.200]   is why exclamation mark, OU.
[00:48:46.200 --> 00:48:46.880]   Get it?
[00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:47.240]   I know.
[00:48:47.240 --> 00:48:49.360]   That's just so dorky.
[00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:54.040]   The money they spent on the ad agency alone is ridiculous.
[00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:56.120]   That exclamation point was just the bane of my existence
[00:48:56.120 --> 00:48:56.800]   at Lifehackers.
[00:48:56.800 --> 00:48:58.760]   Like we'd have these editor-- these copy style guide
[00:48:58.760 --> 00:49:00.640]   meetings like, do we put the exclamation point?
[00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:03.600]   God, it makes it read so funny, but this is their name.
[00:49:03.600 --> 00:49:05.320]   It's like you're doing an ad for them.
[00:49:05.320 --> 00:49:06.200]   Yeah.
[00:49:06.200 --> 00:49:06.960]   It's like you're always--
[00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:08.080]   Yahoo!
[00:49:08.080 --> 00:49:09.680]   Yahoo!
[00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:10.400]   Well, you know that.
[00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:15.160]   And the peanut butter memo guy got hired by AOL last week.
[00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:15.680]   No.
[00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:16.800]   The guy in his name--
[00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:17.400]   The guy who said--
[00:49:17.400 --> 00:49:17.880]   I think so, right.
[00:49:17.880 --> 00:49:20.160]   We're spreading ourselves too thin like peanut butter
[00:49:20.160 --> 00:49:21.680]   and a piece of bread.
[00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:22.480]   He left.
[00:49:22.480 --> 00:49:25.960]   Well, my favorite resignation letter ever, if you can find it,
[00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:29.320]   is Stuart Butterfield's resignation from Yahoo.
[00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:30.320]   That was classic.
[00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:33.240]   He was tired of the tin business.
[00:49:33.240 --> 00:49:33.880]   Oh, yeah.
[00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:35.320]   I loved that.
[00:49:35.320 --> 00:49:36.240]   It was brilliant.
[00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:37.120]   And I think it said a lot.
[00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:38.320]   And Yahoo just can't change.
[00:49:38.320 --> 00:49:39.040]   It's still the same.
[00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:40.800]   It's still a company that's going to go off
[00:49:40.800 --> 00:49:42.400]   and spend hundreds of millions of dollars
[00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:43.320]   to tell us to love us.
[00:49:43.320 --> 00:49:47.520]   Stuart founded Flickr with Katarina Fake.
[00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:49.720]   And yeah, here it is.
[00:49:49.720 --> 00:49:53.440]   Dear Brad, as you know, tin is in my blood.
[00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:55.600]   For generations, my family has worked
[00:49:55.600 --> 00:49:57.640]   with this most useful of metals.
[00:49:57.640 --> 00:49:58.600]   This is so bizarre.
[00:49:58.600 --> 00:50:00.440]   When I read this, I thought, what?
[00:50:00.440 --> 00:50:02.600]   When I joined Yahoo back in '21, it
[00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:05.360]   was a sheet tin concern of great momentum, growth,
[00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:06.040]   and innovation.
[00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:09.120]   I knew this was the place for me.
[00:50:09.120 --> 00:50:11.800]   He talks about the company grew and expanded into dyes
[00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:15.120]   and punches, copper, corrugated steel, synthesized rubber,
[00:50:15.120 --> 00:50:17.760]   piping, milling equipment, engines, instruments, weaponry,
[00:50:17.760 --> 00:50:19.720]   and so on.
[00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:24.360]   Then electronics, grain processing, lighting, and salty snacks.
[00:50:24.360 --> 00:50:27.040]   Since the late '80s is a general manufacturing oil
[00:50:27.040 --> 00:50:29.680]   explanation and refining logistics and hotel and casino
[00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:33.600]   divisions rose to prominence, I have felt somewhat sidelined.
[00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:35.680]   By the time of the internet revolution and our expansion
[00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:38.000]   into websites, I have been cast adrift.
[00:50:38.000 --> 00:50:41.120]   Nary a sheet of tin has rolled off our own production lines
[00:50:41.120 --> 00:50:43.200]   in over 30 years.
[00:50:43.200 --> 00:50:46.160]   Please accept my resignation, and I don't need no fancy parties
[00:50:46.160 --> 00:50:47.400]   or gold watches.
[00:50:47.400 --> 00:50:49.000]   I'll be spending more time with my family,
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:51.240]   tending to my small but growing alpaca herd,
[00:50:51.240 --> 00:50:55.560]   and of course, getting back to working with tin, my first love.
[00:50:55.560 --> 00:50:57.440]   That's actually pretty clever now that I read it.
[00:50:57.440 --> 00:50:58.520]   It is the greatest ever.
[00:50:58.520 --> 00:50:59.600]   In hindsight.
[00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:00.840]   Yeah, that is classic.
[00:51:00.840 --> 00:51:03.520]   That'll go down in the annals.
[00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:05.320]   Can we talk about geolocation real quick?
[00:51:05.320 --> 00:51:08.320]   Yes, because I know you're all excited about this.
[00:51:08.320 --> 00:51:08.760]   I am.
[00:51:08.760 --> 00:51:09.480]   I am kind of excited about this.
[00:51:09.480 --> 00:51:10.440]   This is Twitter, though, right?
[00:51:10.440 --> 00:51:11.360]   Not, yeah, not to go.
[00:51:11.360 --> 00:51:12.600]   Yeah, yeah, this is--
[00:51:12.600 --> 00:51:14.320]   But it'll tie back to Google in a second.
[00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:14.840]   OK.
[00:51:14.840 --> 00:51:15.320]   Keep going, Gina.
[00:51:15.320 --> 00:51:16.400]   We'll tie it back.
[00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:16.960]   Oh, OK.
[00:51:16.960 --> 00:51:18.280]   OK, good, good, good.
[00:51:18.280 --> 00:51:21.000]   So I was at the Twitter conference this week in Los Angeles,
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:22.920]   which was weird, but good.
[00:51:22.920 --> 00:51:26.120]   Wait a minute, why weird, because Tony Robbins was there?
[00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:29.480]   Well, actually, I got totally sucked into the Tony Robbins
[00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:30.200]   tractor beam.
[00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:31.280]   I mean, that guy--
[00:51:31.280 --> 00:51:32.040]   He can own--
[00:51:32.040 --> 00:51:34.320]   Oh, you're hip, no time.
[00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:35.320]   Oh, hi, goodness.
[00:51:35.320 --> 00:51:36.720]   I've seen it happen so many times.
[00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:37.960]   He's very charismatic.
[00:51:37.960 --> 00:51:39.640]   He's a brilliant speaker.
[00:51:39.640 --> 00:51:41.160]   He's a passionate storyteller.
[00:51:41.160 --> 00:51:42.520]   I mean, it was amazing.
[00:51:42.520 --> 00:51:44.240]   I used to make fun of him.
[00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:45.960]   But now that I've seen him talk, I feel--
[00:51:45.960 --> 00:51:46.440]   I don't know.
[00:51:46.440 --> 00:51:49.080]   I feel like I've been brainwashed somehow.
[00:51:49.080 --> 00:51:52.000]   The conference was a little weird for me,
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:53.680]   because I normally go to tech conferences that
[00:51:53.680 --> 00:51:55.160]   are developer heavy and tech heavy.
[00:51:55.160 --> 00:51:57.720]   And this was very a kind of celebrity heavy.
[00:51:57.720 --> 00:51:59.440]   Like Twitter, it was a little disappointingly
[00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:00.120]   celebrity heavy.
[00:52:00.120 --> 00:52:02.880]   So it wasn't necessarily the group that I'm used to.
[00:52:02.880 --> 00:52:06.960]   But there was a developer track that was very lightly attended.
[00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:08.400]   So it was fantastic for me, because I
[00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:11.720]   got to ask Alex Payne and Ryan Sauber,
[00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:14.640]   as many questions as I wanted, because they're about maybe 10
[00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:16.120]   to 15 people in the room.
[00:52:16.120 --> 00:52:17.320]   And it was kind of a big deal.
[00:52:17.320 --> 00:52:20.760]   They were going to launch geolocation API features
[00:52:20.760 --> 00:52:21.760]   for the conference.
[00:52:21.760 --> 00:52:23.720]   And I guess it just had made it through the final stages
[00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:24.360]   of testing yet.
[00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:25.960]   So the launch didn't happen.
[00:52:25.960 --> 00:52:28.560]   But they explained a lot about how it's going to work.
[00:52:28.560 --> 00:52:30.240]   So this is along with Retweet.
[00:52:30.240 --> 00:52:33.680]   These are two new additions to the API.
[00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:34.200]   Yes.
[00:52:34.200 --> 00:52:34.480]   Yes.
[00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:37.640]   Project Retweet is an addition to the API.
[00:52:37.640 --> 00:52:38.720]   And actually, it's interesting.
[00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:41.560]   They're launching these new features via the API first.
[00:52:41.560 --> 00:52:43.720]   So that application developers will get a head start
[00:52:43.720 --> 00:52:48.040]   on how they will display the interface and how it will work.
[00:52:48.040 --> 00:52:49.760]   And Google, I guess, could have learned a little something
[00:52:49.760 --> 00:52:50.720]   from SideWicky.
[00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:51.600]   So pretty interesting.
[00:52:51.600 --> 00:52:54.240]   I mean, Twitter is basically giving application developers
[00:52:54.240 --> 00:52:57.760]   the chance to make this stuff work on the front end
[00:52:57.760 --> 00:52:58.520]   before they do.
[00:52:58.520 --> 00:53:00.360]   They're on their website.
[00:53:00.360 --> 00:53:02.680]   So yes, Project Retweet is a separate thing,
[00:53:02.680 --> 00:53:05.440]   although I got some details on that as well.
[00:53:05.440 --> 00:53:10.520]   The Retweet project is basically just like public bookmarking.
[00:53:10.520 --> 00:53:12.040]   You can't comment on Retweet.
[00:53:12.040 --> 00:53:15.520]   You'll just be able to say, here, I've retweeted this.
[00:53:15.520 --> 00:53:17.520]   And you can't make any comments.
[00:53:17.520 --> 00:53:18.840]   And other people see it.
[00:53:18.840 --> 00:53:21.320]   The people who follow you see it.
[00:53:21.320 --> 00:53:22.680]   So it works a lot like bookmarks,
[00:53:22.680 --> 00:53:25.400]   that you can't edit the person's original tweet
[00:53:25.400 --> 00:53:27.000]   or added comment to it.
[00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:28.200]   That was a little disappointing.
[00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:30.960]   And Jeff, I loved your response to my tweet about that.
[00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:35.400]   You retweeted it with a comment, which I thought was great.
[00:53:35.400 --> 00:53:36.720]   It wasn't lost on me.
[00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:38.120]   I love meta.
[00:53:38.120 --> 00:53:40.640]   Yeah.
[00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:43.000]   But the geolocation features are pretty interesting.
[00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:44.920]   So basically, this is how it's going to work.
[00:53:44.920 --> 00:53:46.600]   For user profile and for each tweet,
[00:53:46.600 --> 00:53:50.680]   you will be able to include latitude and longitude coordinates.
[00:53:50.680 --> 00:53:52.760]   And it's totally opt in.
[00:53:52.760 --> 00:53:53.880]   So it's off by default.
[00:53:53.880 --> 00:53:55.760]   You have to go to a page on Twitter on Twitter site
[00:53:55.760 --> 00:53:58.840]   in your settings to say, yes, you can save and publish
[00:53:58.840 --> 00:54:00.520]   my location details.
[00:54:00.520 --> 00:54:01.440]   This is the interesting thing.
[00:54:01.440 --> 00:54:04.240]   Twitter is going to delete location data,
[00:54:04.240 --> 00:54:08.000]   latitude and longitude data for tweets after 14 days,
[00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:11.200]   after 14 day period, because they to avoid subpoenas.
[00:54:11.200 --> 00:54:13.120]   Yeah.
[00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:13.960]   So now Google--
[00:54:13.960 --> 00:54:15.640]   - Well, I can understand that because you wouldn't want
[00:54:15.640 --> 00:54:18.120]   to use it because if law enforcement said,
[00:54:18.120 --> 00:54:22.080]   well, where were you on the night of October 22nd, 2003?
[00:54:22.080 --> 00:54:23.600]   - But there are two I want to opt in.
[00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:26.800]   If I give a restaurant review, I want it to live on
[00:54:26.800 --> 00:54:29.080]   and not die off in 14 days.
[00:54:29.080 --> 00:54:31.280]   - Well, unless you murder the chef, but that's--
[00:54:31.280 --> 00:54:32.120]   - Well, yeah.
[00:54:32.120 --> 00:54:33.280]   - That's a special occasion.
[00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:35.280]   - With a butcher knife in the library.
[00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:37.080]   - In the library, yeah.
[00:54:37.080 --> 00:54:39.920]   And we know it was a library because it said so in your tweet.
[00:54:39.920 --> 00:54:41.840]   Now, I think that that's a reasonable response
[00:54:41.840 --> 00:54:43.920]   to privacy concerns, but you think Gina
[00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:45.680]   that kind of makes it less useful.
[00:54:45.680 --> 00:54:47.880]   - Well, no, I mean, I was surprised about it
[00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:49.880]   because I just, I thought that there was like
[00:54:49.880 --> 00:54:51.040]   precedents for this stuff.
[00:54:51.040 --> 00:54:51.880]   I mean, I just didn't know--
[00:54:51.880 --> 00:54:53.760]   - Latitude keeps it forever.
[00:54:53.760 --> 00:54:54.880]   - I'm not sure.
[00:54:54.880 --> 00:54:57.640]   I think that latitude deletes it when you update again.
[00:54:57.640 --> 00:54:59.280]   I'm not sure how it works.
[00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:00.680]   - So it doesn't keep history?
[00:55:00.680 --> 00:55:04.600]   - I expected that it would anonymize it in a way or fuzz it.
[00:55:04.600 --> 00:55:05.960]   I thought there would be a way to say,
[00:55:05.960 --> 00:55:10.280]   you know, I was in this sort of 10 to 15 mile area,
[00:55:10.280 --> 00:55:12.200]   but I guess I really honestly haven't thought about it
[00:55:12.200 --> 00:55:13.040]   very much.
[00:55:13.040 --> 00:55:13.880]   I'm not going to do geolocation stuff
[00:55:13.880 --> 00:55:17.560]   because I really don't want people to see where I am.
[00:55:17.560 --> 00:55:19.440]   Anybody be able to see where I am at any given point,
[00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:21.280]   but it really kind of made me think about it.
[00:55:21.280 --> 00:55:23.440]   They're not going to do this indefinitely.
[00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:25.480]   They're going to figure out a safe quote unquote,
[00:55:25.480 --> 00:55:27.360]   this is what they said, a safe way to store this data
[00:55:27.360 --> 00:55:28.480]   historically.
[00:55:28.480 --> 00:55:30.560]   But the risk comes in that application developers
[00:55:30.560 --> 00:55:32.280]   are going to get this data and they're encouraging
[00:55:32.280 --> 00:55:35.720]   application developers to also delete this data
[00:55:35.720 --> 00:55:38.360]   and not to store historical data because app developers
[00:55:38.360 --> 00:55:41.560]   could become the, you could get subpoenaed.
[00:55:41.560 --> 00:55:43.360]   But I don't know, but I'm not sure how they're going to
[00:55:43.360 --> 00:55:45.360]   enforce this or check it.
[00:55:45.360 --> 00:55:48.920]   You know, so it'll be interesting to see how that works.
[00:55:48.920 --> 00:55:49.760]   If you're Twitter-
[00:55:49.760 --> 00:55:51.920]   - That's the guardian gene of the guardian
[00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:55.200]   that puts out its API for all of its content.
[00:55:55.200 --> 00:55:58.480]   And one of the requirements under British libel law
[00:55:58.480 --> 00:56:02.200]   is that you must refresh the content every 24 hours
[00:56:02.200 --> 00:56:05.160]   so that in case there's been a correction or deletion,
[00:56:05.160 --> 00:56:08.000]   you get that in the pool.
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:09.440]   It sounds like you need to do something like that
[00:56:09.440 --> 00:56:12.920]   where you have to refresh or else your key expires.
[00:56:12.920 --> 00:56:15.440]   - Right, but if you're writing an application
[00:56:15.440 --> 00:56:17.280]   like my application, Twitter-lytic,
[00:56:17.280 --> 00:56:21.800]   which stores a history of yours and your friends' tweets,
[00:56:21.800 --> 00:56:24.440]   over time, basically you have to go back
[00:56:24.440 --> 00:56:25.760]   into your own database and say, okay,
[00:56:25.760 --> 00:56:27.080]   the latitude and longitude coordinates
[00:56:27.080 --> 00:56:30.400]   that are older than 14 days scrub them or change them
[00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:32.160]   or get rid of them.
[00:56:32.160 --> 00:56:33.680]   - How do they enforce that?
[00:56:33.680 --> 00:56:34.520]   - Well, this is the thing.
[00:56:34.520 --> 00:56:36.440]   How are they going to enforce it?
[00:56:36.440 --> 00:56:37.720]   It remains to be seen.
[00:56:37.720 --> 00:56:39.760]   I don't know how they will.
[00:56:39.760 --> 00:56:41.080]   - It's not like you can have a,
[00:56:41.080 --> 00:56:45.160]   this geolocation information will self-destruct in two weeks.
[00:56:45.160 --> 00:56:46.480]   - Right, right.
[00:56:46.480 --> 00:56:49.480]   And cynically it just means that they don't have
[00:56:49.480 --> 00:56:50.320]   to have the lawyers get it out.
[00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:51.640]   - They're not responsible.
[00:56:51.640 --> 00:56:53.360]   Gina gets the subpoena.
[00:56:53.360 --> 00:56:54.520]   - Well, right, right, right.
[00:56:54.520 --> 00:56:56.080]   And they're saying, you know, be careful
[00:56:56.080 --> 00:56:58.640]   what you do with this data and don't keep historical data
[00:56:58.640 --> 00:57:00.320]   so that you don't have to deal with subpoenas
[00:57:00.320 --> 00:57:02.080]   'cause they're a big deal.
[00:57:02.080 --> 00:57:03.600]   - By the way, that's the new title of the show.
[00:57:03.600 --> 00:57:05.320]   Gina rhymes with subpoena.
[00:57:07.160 --> 00:57:08.480]   - So send them to her.
[00:57:08.480 --> 00:57:10.840]   No, that's what it is.
[00:57:10.840 --> 00:57:11.880]   You're exactly right, Jeff.
[00:57:11.880 --> 00:57:14.160]   They're just washing their hands of it.
[00:57:14.160 --> 00:57:15.000]   And they're saying--
[00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:16.080]   - I mean, a little cynical, but--
[00:57:16.080 --> 00:57:17.560]   - I think you're right.
[00:57:17.560 --> 00:57:18.880]   They want the feature so much.
[00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:21.000]   This was probably their answer to the lawyers to say,
[00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:23.280]   F you, we're gonna do it anyway.
[00:57:23.280 --> 00:57:25.680]   - See, I use, believe it or not, I'm crazy,
[00:57:25.680 --> 00:57:28.360]   but I like, I've used Bright Kind, I've used Latitude.
[00:57:28.360 --> 00:57:31.160]   And right now I'm a big fan of Four Square.
[00:57:31.160 --> 00:57:33.680]   The reason I think Four Square is the winner in this
[00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:35.560]   is 'cause it's a game and it's fun
[00:57:35.560 --> 00:57:36.600]   and you like to be the mayor
[00:57:36.600 --> 00:57:39.440]   and they have very clear monetization potential
[00:57:39.440 --> 00:57:41.280]   because the way Four Square works,
[00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:44.640]   when you go to a place three times,
[00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:46.120]   you become the mayor of that place
[00:57:46.120 --> 00:57:47.480]   and you maintain your mayor ship
[00:57:47.480 --> 00:57:49.960]   as long as no one gets there more than you do.
[00:57:49.960 --> 00:57:51.800]   And what you're starting to see is bars say,
[00:57:51.800 --> 00:57:53.960]   free drinks to the mayor,
[00:57:53.960 --> 00:57:56.040]   which encourages people to come and compete,
[00:57:56.040 --> 00:57:57.840]   see who can go there more.
[00:57:57.840 --> 00:57:58.960]   - Oh, that's interesting.
[00:57:58.960 --> 00:58:00.640]   - And so it's good for the bar
[00:58:00.640 --> 00:58:01.800]   and what I believe will happen,
[00:58:01.800 --> 00:58:02.760]   Four Square is not doing this yet,
[00:58:02.760 --> 00:58:05.160]   but by the way, these are the guys who started dodgeball.
[00:58:05.160 --> 00:58:08.040]   They've moved out of Google and created it basically,
[00:58:08.040 --> 00:58:10.560]   another dodgeball.
[00:58:10.560 --> 00:58:13.520]   The way they monetize is they have business services.
[00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:18.000]   We'll work with your business to encourage traffic.
[00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:18.840]   They give you badges.
[00:58:18.840 --> 00:58:22.040]   - Well, this gets us back to Google.
[00:58:22.040 --> 00:58:23.440]   Is the other thing Google did this week
[00:58:23.440 --> 00:58:27.160]   was we released some place pages,
[00:58:27.160 --> 00:58:29.520]   which I think is really important
[00:58:29.520 --> 00:58:31.480]   and Twitter fits right into that.
[00:58:33.480 --> 00:58:34.840]   - In the bigger meta view,
[00:58:34.840 --> 00:58:37.120]   I think we end up with an annotated world.
[00:58:37.120 --> 00:58:41.640]   That every place on earth is going to have comment about it.
[00:58:41.640 --> 00:58:44.320]   - I think it's such an interesting idea.
[00:58:44.320 --> 00:58:45.960]   - Where does this information come from?
[00:58:45.960 --> 00:58:47.240]   This place pages information.
[00:58:47.240 --> 00:58:49.520]   - Well, right now, I mean, 'cause Google right now,
[00:58:49.520 --> 00:58:52.480]   of course, in maps has Yelp
[00:58:52.480 --> 00:58:54.200]   and has other things and Yelp is very good.
[00:58:54.200 --> 00:58:57.040]   This is actually a bit of a side wiki problem for Google
[00:58:57.040 --> 00:58:59.320]   because Google, even though it's created an aggregated page
[00:58:59.320 --> 00:59:02.560]   of place wiki, it is encouraging people to make comments there
[00:59:02.560 --> 00:59:06.200]   and it now competes with Yelp and outside.in
[00:59:06.200 --> 00:59:10.720]   and other collectors of the annotations around places.
[00:59:10.720 --> 00:59:13.480]   But I understand what Google wants to do
[00:59:13.480 --> 00:59:14.560]   and you have Eric Schmidt saying
[00:59:14.560 --> 00:59:16.440]   that mobile is going to be more profitable for us
[00:59:16.440 --> 00:59:17.280]   than the web.
[00:59:17.280 --> 00:59:21.440]   They recognize that every time they get new data,
[00:59:21.440 --> 00:59:24.320]   Marissa Meyer has bragged about all the geo points
[00:59:24.320 --> 00:59:26.160]   of data they have.
[00:59:26.160 --> 00:59:28.080]   At some point, you're going to want to say,
[00:59:28.080 --> 00:59:30.200]   who said what about this restaurant
[00:59:30.200 --> 00:59:33.160]   or about this monument or about this photo
[00:59:33.160 --> 00:59:35.880]   in the gallery, whatever?
[00:59:35.880 --> 00:59:40.880]   And or this bar or God knows, help us this date,
[00:59:40.880 --> 00:59:46.040]   then you add in Yelp, Twitter with geo,
[00:59:46.040 --> 00:59:50.480]   if it has life and legs and other sources like that,
[00:59:50.480 --> 00:59:53.040]   blog posts organized through outside.in,
[00:59:53.040 --> 00:59:57.120]   it becomes incredibly rich now around a geo annotation
[00:59:57.120 --> 00:59:58.720]   layer of information.
[00:59:58.720 --> 01:00:00.560]   Well, you know, as a local business,
[01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:02.960]   I went to the Google Local Business Center
[01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:06.640]   and inputted data about my business, its location.
[01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:08.960]   You can put in pictures and videos.
[01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:12.160]   And that's important because when you do a Google Local Search,
[01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:16.800]   the first thing at the top of a Google Local Search result
[01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:21.800]   is a map of related businesses
[01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:26.560]   and you want to be on that list and that's free.
[01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:27.640]   So that's one way they get
[01:00:27.640 --> 01:00:29.360]   of people putting in this information.
[01:00:29.360 --> 01:00:31.680]   They already have every business in the world
[01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:33.360]   presumably wanting to do that.
[01:00:33.360 --> 01:00:35.920]   Just like our profiles and everything else,
[01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:36.760]   like more data.
[01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:39.280]   Right, it's a profile of businesses.
[01:00:39.280 --> 01:00:41.680]   And now if you add SideWicky onto that,
[01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:45.440]   if people are commenting on the website for that place,
[01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:47.960]   uh oh, it all comes together.
[01:00:47.960 --> 01:00:49.720]   Well, and this is where the real value is,
[01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:51.960]   that's why Robert Scobles always said that Facebook
[01:00:51.960 --> 01:00:54.120]   has the best play in all of this
[01:00:54.120 --> 01:00:56.200]   because they have all this metadata.
[01:00:56.200 --> 01:00:57.920]   They have all, you have your social graph
[01:00:57.920 --> 01:00:59.280]   and they have the metadata.
[01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:01.000]   Google's missing the social graph piece,
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:03.160]   but I think they probably can find a way
[01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:05.400]   to make that work with Google Social.
[01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:08.560]   Now when you go to a place,
[01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:10.120]   you could say here's what your friends are saying
[01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:11.680]   about that place.
[01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:13.400]   That's hugely valuable to Google.
[01:01:13.400 --> 01:01:16.640]   - Yeah, I think for the Geo stuff,
[01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:18.120]   being able to check in at businesses
[01:01:18.120 --> 01:01:20.600]   and comment about businesses and public places like that
[01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:21.800]   is really useful.
[01:01:21.800 --> 01:01:24.400]   But speaking of Scoble, he did a great post
[01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:27.000]   about Four Square and he said that,
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:30.440]   he checks in, there's a Ritz hotel near his home.
[01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:32.560]   So when he's home, he checks in at the Ritz
[01:01:32.560 --> 01:01:35.560]   and not the exact location of his home.
[01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:38.480]   - So he's the mayor of the Ritz Carlton Half Moon Bay.
[01:01:38.480 --> 01:01:39.320]   - Right, yeah.
[01:01:39.320 --> 01:01:40.160]   - Yes, exactly.
[01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:41.080]   So he's the mayor of the Ritz Carlton.
[01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:43.560]   And I believe that Four Square allows you to do this.
[01:01:43.560 --> 01:01:45.120]   So Four Square, and I'm not sure if you use it,
[01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:46.400]   but they allow you to choose--
[01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:47.720]   - You could check in anywhere you want.
[01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:48.560]   - You could buy a place.
[01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:49.720]   You could check in wherever you want, right?
[01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:52.760]   You're not forced to use the GPRS coordinates
[01:01:52.760 --> 01:01:53.920]   on your device.
[01:01:53.920 --> 01:01:56.960]   - Furthermore, you can check in after you leave,
[01:01:56.960 --> 01:01:58.040]   or as you're leaving.
[01:01:58.040 --> 01:01:59.400]   So if you're worried about stalkers,
[01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:00.880]   this is kind of what I do is I check in
[01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:03.520]   as I leave as opposed to as I arrive.
[01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:04.960]   - See, that's smart.
[01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:07.040]   And I hope that Twitter developers,
[01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:09.240]   Twitter client developers will keep this in mind
[01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:11.320]   when they make their UI for sending
[01:02:11.320 --> 01:02:12.840]   lat-long coordinates to Twitter.
[01:02:12.840 --> 01:02:16.480]   Because Twitter doesn't have any way to verify
[01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:18.560]   whether or not the coordinates you're sending are true.
[01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:21.000]   And it would be really nice if I could check in
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:22.800]   at the coffee shop down the street
[01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:25.000]   when I'm really at the office,
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:26.200]   and say, hey, I'm here.
[01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:29.080]   So it's a way for me to control the impression
[01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:31.600]   that I put out on social media networks, right?
[01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:33.560]   That's why the only photos you'll see of me online
[01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:36.960]   are ones of me looking up or whatever, right?
[01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:40.120]   Because this is the kind of control that we want
[01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:41.920]   without sort of revealing our true location.
[01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:44.080]   Because I guess there's another service, a Goala,
[01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:46.080]   I wanna say that actually forces you to use
[01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:49.160]   your device's coordinates, and you can't change them.
[01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:52.560]   And that's, he scobo called that the anti-feature.
[01:02:52.560 --> 01:02:53.600]   And I absolutely agree with that.
[01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:54.640]   - I think I'm with him on that.
[01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:58.440]   Bright Kite allows you to say anywhere nearby as well.
[01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:00.160]   Now, latitude's automatic, isn't it?
[01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:02.740]   Latitude just puts a pin where you are.
[01:03:02.740 --> 01:03:05.240]   - I've never even installed it.
[01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:08.280]   - I've used lavitude, and basically the Android phone
[01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:10.760]   is constantly sending out a signal as to where you are.
[01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:13.600]   It's like a little dot in the map that follows you around.
[01:03:13.600 --> 01:03:15.400]   It's all that connection.
[01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:17.320]   - That's really scary.
[01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:18.960]   - Well, that becomes interesting too.
[01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:21.640]   I'm advancing to my number of the week.
[01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:26.520]   But one of the cool features I saw on that is map my run.
[01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:28.080]   And the features that enable you to take
[01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:31.160]   rather than a static place, a route.
[01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:33.040]   And whether it's a perspective route of where you're going
[01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:34.840]   to go, a route of where you've been,
[01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:37.320]   and what all is along the way,
[01:03:37.320 --> 01:03:39.000]   becomes really interesting too.
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:40.800]   And it goes against a time there.
[01:03:40.800 --> 01:03:44.200]   And then you go to things like traffic and recommendations
[01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:45.520]   and who's there at the same time,
[01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:47.720]   and how far away are you from things?
[01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:49.360]   And it gets extremely rich.
[01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:52.520]   It becomes a 3D chess game in geography.
[01:03:52.520 --> 01:03:53.400]   - I love that.
[01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:56.880]   Now Ken Shepherds is asking in our friend feed chat,
[01:03:56.880 --> 01:04:01.560]   a legitimate question, which is why the annotations
[01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:04.600]   on a business site don't bother you when side wiki does.
[01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:05.960]   What is the difference there, Jack?
[01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:07.200]   - Oh, that bothers me as well,
[01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:09.600]   because I think what can happen is that Uncle Luigi's
[01:04:09.600 --> 01:04:12.760]   pizzeria can be slammed by...
[01:04:12.760 --> 01:04:14.560]   - By thominas.
[01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:15.560]   - Right.
[01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:18.880]   And so no, I think it's the exact same problem there.
[01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:21.240]   And what you want, you also saw this happen with,
[01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:22.480]   and I haven't followed this very much,
[01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:25.440]   but with Squadoo, Seth Godin's company,
[01:04:25.440 --> 01:04:26.880]   we did something with Businesses this week,
[01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:28.480]   and there was controversy around that,
[01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:30.120]   and whether people can opt in or opt out,
[01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:32.080]   or have control and have responsibility.
[01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:35.600]   You know, again, if you allow,
[01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:36.760]   I understand the conundrum here,
[01:04:36.760 --> 01:04:38.400]   if you allow people to opt out of side wiki,
[01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:40.000]   then every spammer will opt out.
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:41.400]   - Right.
[01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:42.400]   - And then maybe at some point,
[01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:44.720]   that becomes a sign of disrespect right there.
[01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:47.320]   I don't know, but you've got to recognize that some people
[01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:48.440]   are going to take responsibility,
[01:04:48.440 --> 01:04:51.240]   and some people are going to have to deal with these demons
[01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:52.080]   who come along.
[01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:56.720]   - It's kind of like the Google Book Search deal.
[01:04:56.720 --> 01:04:57.880]   There's some real benefits,
[01:04:57.880 --> 01:04:59.480]   public potential public benefits,
[01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:03.360]   but there are also trouble in some areas.
[01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:04.880]   And you kind of have to work it out.
[01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:06.400]   - It's a problem of Google size now,
[01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:08.520]   and when you go to something like places,
[01:05:08.520 --> 01:05:09.880]   they're going to compete with other companies,
[01:05:09.880 --> 01:05:12.600]   and they're going to compete with their own channel.
[01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:14.560]   - We don't have time to talk about this,
[01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:15.760]   and Siva can't join us,
[01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:18.080]   so maybe we'll postpone it for next week.
[01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:18.920]   - That's an idea.
[01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:20.000]   - But it looks like the Google Book Settlement
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:21.400]   is now back on the table.
[01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:23.440]   Google's saying, "All right, if the DOJ doesn't like it,
[01:05:23.440 --> 01:05:25.760]   we better go back and renegotiate."
[01:05:25.760 --> 01:05:29.920]   So this year old deal looks like it's falling apart again,
[01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:31.960]   and it's back on the table,
[01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:33.840]   back negotiating with the Google Book Search.
[01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:35.400]   We'll talk about that in just a bit,
[01:05:35.400 --> 01:05:36.240]   but let's get right now,
[01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:39.440]   and let's get to Gina's tip of the week, Gina.
[01:05:39.440 --> 01:05:41.600]   - Yes, yes, this is an exciting one.
[01:05:41.600 --> 01:05:45.480]   This week, Google launch Google Sync for iPhone users,
[01:05:45.480 --> 01:05:46.880]   and for Windows Mobile users,
[01:05:46.880 --> 01:05:49.320]   and for Nokia as 60 users.
[01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:50.480]   And this is really cool.
[01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:53.640]   So right now, the best way to get your Gmail
[01:05:53.640 --> 01:05:55.400]   on your iPhone is via iMap,
[01:05:55.400 --> 01:05:57.000]   which isn't quite push.
[01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:59.840]   It's pretty good, it depends on how often your client
[01:05:59.840 --> 01:06:02.800]   checks the iMap server for new messages,
[01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:04.520]   but it is polling.
[01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:08.240]   Well, Google Sync gives you access to your Gmail account
[01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:11.480]   via Microsoft Exchange Active Sync.
[01:06:11.480 --> 01:06:13.920]   Okay, so if you set up your iPhone to get your Gmail,
[01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:16.040]   or your iPhone, or your Windows Mobile phone,
[01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:18.360]   or Nokia phone, via Microsoft Active Sync,
[01:06:18.360 --> 01:06:22.840]   and you get live push Gmail alerts,
[01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:24.760]   calendars, and contacts.
[01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:26.920]   Now, there are some limitations,
[01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:30.520]   and we'll link to those in the show notes.
[01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:32.000]   And there are some things that you should be aware of,
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:33.680]   like if you delete a message on the iPhone,
[01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:35.160]   it actually gets archived, that kind of thing.
[01:06:35.160 --> 01:06:36.120]   So check that out.
[01:06:36.120 --> 01:06:38.520]   But if you're currently using iMap on your iPhone,
[01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:39.800]   or your Windows Mobile phone,
[01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:42.600]   definitely consider switching over to Google Sync,
[01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:44.960]   which is not a separate ad on a product or app,
[01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:48.920]   it is just Microsoft Exchange Active Sync access
[01:06:48.920 --> 01:06:50.400]   to your Gmail.
[01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:52.440]   - I've been using the Google Sync on my calendars
[01:06:52.440 --> 01:06:55.080]   and address book, and I just now go in there,
[01:06:55.080 --> 01:06:57.360]   and I see, oh, they've added mail as an entry there,
[01:06:57.360 --> 01:06:58.640]   so I just turn that on,
[01:06:58.640 --> 01:07:00.600]   and now I'm gonna have to push mail as well.
[01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:01.880]   - Yep, good stuff.
[01:07:01.880 --> 01:07:04.040]   - That's really nice, yeah.
[01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:04.880]   Well done, Google.
[01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:07.080]   And now Jeff's number of the--
[01:07:07.080 --> 01:07:09.080]   - My number is 87.
[01:07:09.080 --> 01:07:09.920]   Adweek was a number--
[01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:11.160]   - No, I think you shouldn't explain it.
[01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:12.800]   Just say it, 87, thank you.
[01:07:12.800 --> 01:07:13.640]   - 87, that's it.
[01:07:13.640 --> 01:07:15.160]   (laughing)
[01:07:15.160 --> 01:07:17.160]   - It's like the prisoner and Gina's playing.
[01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:18.720]   - And you-- - Number six.
[01:07:18.720 --> 01:07:21.800]   - And we could leave it for the audience to discern--
[01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:23.360]   - We'll find it, and you get a prize.
[01:07:23.360 --> 01:07:25.000]   - No, we won't start that yet.
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:26.160]   What is 87?
[01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:29.600]   - Google's Creative Labs and presented it at Adweek,
[01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:31.240]   and some of it's stuff we know,
[01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:34.080]   but it's really a nice presentation of neat crap
[01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:36.600]   that's made on the web using tools.
[01:07:36.600 --> 01:07:40.720]   So it includes a worldwide real life of Monopoly,
[01:07:40.720 --> 01:07:44.000]   karaoke tube, watching what people are buying real live
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:48.160]   on Zappos, map my run, YouTube, symphony,
[01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:49.000]   and all those kinds of things.
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:50.320]   So it's a really nice little presentation
[01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:52.840]   to give you hope for the web and creativity again.
[01:07:52.840 --> 01:07:56.360]   - There's hope for the web, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:07:56.360 --> 01:07:59.240]   - My tool was gonna be side-wicky,
[01:07:59.240 --> 01:08:01.760]   but I guess there's nothing more to be said about it.
[01:08:01.760 --> 01:08:03.960]   (laughing)
[01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:05.280]   Killed it.
[01:08:05.280 --> 01:08:07.160]   We really, well that's good, we're done anyway.
[01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:10.920]   But my initial reaction to side-wicky,
[01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:12.880]   as it is with anything new on the web,
[01:08:12.880 --> 01:08:15.560]   is oh let me try this, and I tried it, and I liked it,
[01:08:15.560 --> 01:08:19.320]   but boy, after I read you and Gina's comments on this thing,
[01:08:19.320 --> 01:08:22.200]   I thought, well I guess I should be aware of it anyway.
[01:08:22.200 --> 01:08:23.960]   And I guess what people should do is sign up to use
[01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:26.440]   those webmaster tools so you at least can assert
[01:08:26.440 --> 01:08:27.360]   some ownership of this.
[01:08:27.360 --> 01:08:29.160]   I wish they had, and I hope that I presume
[01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:32.120]   that they will have some anti-spam tools and things like that,
[01:08:32.120 --> 01:08:34.360]   'cause I could just see what a mess this is gonna be.
[01:08:34.360 --> 01:08:35.480]   - There's also a bookmarklet.
[01:08:35.480 --> 01:08:37.200]   For people who don't wanna install a toolbar,
[01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:38.800]   and just wanna see comments on their own site,
[01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:40.600]   or comments on other sites, there is a bookmarklet,
[01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:42.400]   and we'll include the link in the show notes.
[01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:43.760]   It's in our friend feed room.
[01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:45.800]   - Yes, and that's a good point.
[01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:47.560]   You can actually, if you could figure out
[01:08:47.560 --> 01:08:50.680]   what the URL is for the side-wicky, you can give out,
[01:08:50.680 --> 01:08:53.360]   and I've seen people do this, a URL that seems
[01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:55.480]   to work in any browser that gives you the side-wicky
[01:08:55.480 --> 01:08:56.800]   as well as the page, right?
[01:08:56.800 --> 01:09:00.080]   It seems to, so you don't have to have the toolbar,
[01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:02.560]   you can actually figure out what that URL is,
[01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:05.640]   and I guess the bookmark might help with that.
[01:09:05.640 --> 01:09:07.360]   - Yeah, and you just can't post comments that way.
[01:09:07.360 --> 01:09:08.360]   You need this tomorrow or first comments.
[01:09:08.360 --> 01:09:09.400]   - It's real only, yeah.
[01:09:09.400 --> 01:09:12.480]   - Right, I mean, the API exists, and without a doubt,
[01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:15.200]   there will be WordPress plugins and other products
[01:09:15.200 --> 01:09:16.880]   that come out that let you comment and view,
[01:09:16.880 --> 01:09:18.440]   but for now, there's a bookmarklet,
[01:09:18.440 --> 01:09:19.440]   and I'm sure in the next couple of weeks,
[01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:21.720]   if this does catch on, there'll be other ways
[01:09:21.720 --> 01:09:24.000]   to access the comments.
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:27.920]   - DesignMe.com/sidewinder.
[01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:29.960]   I'm sorry, designMeam.me.
[01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:33.680]   - DesignMeam.com/sidewinder.
[01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:36.480]   And there, you can find the bookmarklet right there.
[01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:37.320]   - Yep.
[01:09:37.320 --> 01:09:39.280]   - Just drag it to your toolbar,
[01:09:39.280 --> 01:09:41.440]   and you don't have to have anything fancy
[01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:42.600]   around your system.
[01:09:42.600 --> 01:09:45.280]   I'm using Safari, and it still works.
[01:09:45.280 --> 01:09:47.280]   Gina Trapani is at smartawear.org.
[01:09:47.280 --> 01:09:50.160]   That's the place to go to find all sorts of great stuff.
[01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:52.120]   She's writing posts like crazy, and of course,
[01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:53.600]   you see her on Life Hacker.
[01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:55.480]   She's a contributor there, the Harvard Business Review,
[01:09:55.480 --> 01:09:58.360]   and many other sites, but the best place to go aside.
[01:09:58.360 --> 01:10:00.440]   So I'm sorry, I must sit side where.
[01:10:00.440 --> 01:10:01.760]   (laughing)
[01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:03.920]   Smartawear.org.
[01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:06.520]   Jeff Jarvis is Mr. Buzz Machine.
[01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:08.160]   We always love talking to Jeff.
[01:10:08.160 --> 01:10:10.280]   Glad you're back after your surgery,
[01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:12.360]   and it sounds like you're in fine fiddle.
[01:10:12.360 --> 01:10:13.200]   Buzz Machine.
[01:10:13.200 --> 01:10:14.040]   - Mortarie again.
[01:10:14.040 --> 01:10:16.360]   - He's back to his cantankerous old self.
[01:10:16.360 --> 01:10:18.360]   We thank you for joining us.
[01:10:18.360 --> 01:10:20.680]   I have a lot of voicemails, but in the interest of time,
[01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:22.360]   I won't play him, we'll play him for next week,
[01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:24.720]   but if you do want to give us listener feedback,
[01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:28.880]   our listener feedback line is 9795 Twig VM.
[01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:32.120]   That's 979-589-4486.
[01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:34.040]   It's a Google voice number,
[01:10:34.040 --> 01:10:35.680]   and you could just leave a message there for us,
[01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:37.000]   and we'll just play a whole bunch of them.
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:38.720]   Next week, you guys don't have to show up.
[01:10:38.720 --> 01:10:40.080]   I'll just play hundreds of,
[01:10:40.080 --> 01:10:40.880]   'cause there's literally,
[01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:42.800]   there's hundreds of voicemail messages.
[01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:44.960]   - Yeah, on slow news weeks, definitely.
[01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:46.680]   - Yeah, this was not a slow news week.
[01:10:46.680 --> 01:10:47.520]   - No, it was not.
[01:10:47.520 --> 01:10:49.120]   - 9795 Twig VM.
[01:10:49.120 --> 01:10:50.520]   We do appreciate you listening.
