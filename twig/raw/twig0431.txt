[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.640]   It's time for Twig this week in Google. Jeff Jarvis is here. Stasis got the day off.
[00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.540]   We've got Matthew Ingram from the Columbia Journalism Review and Kevin Marks from
[00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.520]   NdWeb to talk about the latest news from Google. A look at the new Pixel 2 XL. What's
[00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.980]   good? What's bad? What's in different? Problems with the Pixel book? Besides the
[00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:24.440]   price? Maybe. Only for Jeff. And we'll talk about some very big acquisitions by
[00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:28.680]   Amazon for their Amazon Prime video. Stay tuned. Twig is next.
[00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:37.400]   Netcast you love. From people you trust.

[00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.360]   It's time for Twig this week in Google to show where we cover the latest in
[00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.960]   Google and Stacy's not with us today so you can just turn off the radio and and
[00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.400]   go on about your business. There are a couple of people who will probably do
[00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:13.200]   that because they love Stacy so much but Jeff Jarvis is here. It takes two
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.760]   people to replace Stacy. It does and we have two people. Welcome Jeff professor
[00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.280]   of journalism at City of University of New York. He will be making his escape
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.040]   in one hour so we're going to. Yes I apologize for everyone. I have to talk very
[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.320]   fast to get a whole two hours of show into one hour of shows so I can get off
[00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.400]   and get to the airport so I really am sorry about that but that's the way it
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.080]   is. Sorry. Did you read that article? We'll talk about it in a second about
[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.960]   podcast listeners who listen super fast. Hey that's Matthew Ingram.
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.400]   Congratulations. We haven't seen you since your new job. He's at the Columbia
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.280]   with Columbia. Oh yeah. Mazel. Columbia Review of Journalism. Journalism Review.
[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:51.560]   CJR. Tell us about that. That's exciting. Yeah so it's a new job. What are you doing?
[00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:57.440]   You're a writer. So I'm focusing on basically all things digital media
[00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:03.680]   reinvention of news and journalism, economic aspects, the social aspects,
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:08.000]   political aspects, basically everything. Be a little less breaking news more a
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.560]   little more thoughtful. Yeah I hope so. It's nice. And actually one of the big
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:20.720]   focuses is the power of the platforms. Yes. Well it's certainly one of the
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:26.160]   things we talk about here a lot these days. The platforms being the as far
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.720]   I'd mind you describes it the frightful five right there and their
[00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:37.440]   baleful influence on American society and so forth. No no no. Jeff will well no
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:43.840]   but this is good. We have somebody to defend it. Also with us from a very
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.160]   good job of getting themselves into the five that he sounds distant you sound
[00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:52.880]   distant. Yes I mean I'm Stan. Oh you are distant. There's Kevin Marks,
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:04:00.920]   indieweb.org. He's at a medical devices conference. Medical data from us. Oh there
[00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:06.520]   is a difference isn't there? Oh yes. Give Kevin a little more volume because
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:10.200]   he's he's yeah. Where are you at a pub where he's riding it because you
[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:15.040]   also you get the bar of the background. Yeah. Is it a I mean the hotel bar because
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:18.920]   the wife and my room is not good. This is good. We're happy. It looks nice.
[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:23.240]   Jeff if you're getting we're getting a little buzzing on you so if you let's
[00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.040]   just take care of some of the audio issues here real quick. He just I think
[00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:31.440]   unplug and replug will probably do it. Oh I know. I had my phone on top of it.
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:36.280]   Oh don't put your phone on top. You're using your rockin as they as the
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:41.320]   kids will say you're rocking the Pixel 2 XL is that right? Yeah. Yeah. I mean
[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:46.060]   you know the last two phones I've liked them and the last pixel I end up
[00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.160]   liking his time went on a lot more. I think this would be the same you know
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.840]   is it worth a thousand dollars to switch. I know because I'm an insane person. I
[00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:58.040]   like the bigger the the it's not completely bezelist but the no I like
[00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:01.440]   better. I like the fact that it's just slightly bezeled. Yeah slightly bezeled.
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:06.760]   It's not too big. Well you know when you compare it to so this is the iPhone 10
[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:12.200]   which is the same roughly the same size screen. I mean unlock it. Face ID I've
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:17.480]   come to the conclusion is an interesting idea but not 100% and this is the same
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:23.840]   size screen but a smaller form factor. Yeah. Wow. But what I I have to say I've
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:28.120]   taken the case off of the iPhone 10 which is of course living very
[00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:33.040]   dangerously because A it's glass B it's slippery and C it costs a
[00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:37.800]   phenomenal amount of money to fix and I did not buy Apple Care Plus because I
[00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:44.520]   I don't know why I just didn't. But it is such a jewel and you know this is
[00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:48.360]   stainless steel the the screen is easily the best screen on the market even
[00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:54.200]   besting the no date and easily besting the pixel. It really feels like a work
[00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:59.600]   of a jewelry in your hand but iOS is not nearly as functional and by the way I
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:05.160]   did a camera comparison just to you know I think I like the the pixels camera a
[00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:10.440]   lot better. Oh really. Well I'll just show you I mean look this is this is
[00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:15.800]   not this is far from a scientific survey but I'll I'll let you pick I have two
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:22.800]   pictures. Let me turn motion off. So this is this is of our backyard on our
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:31.880]   overcast day lots of greenery. This is one and this is two. I guess I don't even
[00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:37.800]   have to ask you which you prefer. This is the eye doctor. This is the this is
[00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:42.840]   the one. Yeah. So this is the iPhone and this is a problem that the iPhone 10 is
[00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:47.360]   exhibited which is blowing out highlights. See the sky. You could barely see it.
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:53.040]   This is the pixel same exact. Yeah. I think the details better that the colors
[00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:58.880]   better and certainly the highlights the exposure is better. The HDR has been
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:02.920]   really good on the one that I've got. So the picture too it's especially even
[00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:07.360]   better by going to the camera sensor as well. Yeah it's automatic HDR and so
[00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:11.040]   Apple has two sensors and they do use both sensors for things like this but
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:16.520]   Google has the weird split pixel which it could do dual exposures even saw the
[00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:20.720]   same pixel. So it's a very tiny distance apart. They are able to do dual
[00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:26.440]   exposures and I think that in fact and I think I'm not alone in this. I think
[00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:33.600]   that the pixel to phone camera is better than the iPhone 10 camera. iPhone 10 is
[00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:37.680]   fine and has some other nice little things it does like the portrait lighting
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:42.440]   and stuff. Google does do some portrait stuff but I think I it disappoints me
[00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:45.400]   because I like carrying. I like the physical feel of carrying the iPhone 10
[00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:50.680]   but I am less than in amored. Now there's another problem which people
[00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:58.320]   bet I got. The selfies are too good on the pick on the iPhone 10. I need
[00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:03.160]   better makeup and a lot of people are complaining about this because there's
[00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:09.200]   just way too much this is horrible. Yeah this is a nightmare. This is like I
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:13.440]   never looked so bad but that's exactly what I look like. That's the problem. So
[00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:17.320]   you can have a camera that's too good. This is the iPhone 10 because it's using
[00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:22.680]   that you know that face recognition camera and God I hate it. Portrait mode
[00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:25.520]   see it's blurred in the background although it's nice it gave me a little
[00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:32.320]   halo which I I do appreciate so thank you iPhone for that. Anyway I am not
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:37.200]   Jeff you're not you have no screen burn in right? No I don't. I thought I did. I don't.
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:41.560]   If you put this side by side with the Note 8 or the iPhone 10 it isn't as good
[00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:46.240]   as screen. But stand it by itself it's fine. We also did something really
[00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:53.400]   stupid on the Android launcher on this phone. It has a on the main screen it
[00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:57.720]   throws like a 10% screen over it a fog over it. So I looked at the two
[00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:01.720]   phones and screen I said oh my God this is just awful. It wasn't the it wasn't
[00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:05.080]   the screen it was it was the way they designed the launcher and then the second
[00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:10.040]   problem was that then if you go and look at the at the app tray or or you swipe
[00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:15.600]   right to get the Google News stuff the now the background is there like 5%
[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:20.640]   it's a 95% screen and so I thought I had burn in because I'm stupid and I
[00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:25.200]   didn't but it in either case it's a bad aesthetic it's a very bad aesthetic it
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:31.520]   doesn't let any vibrancy stand out it it it it's dumb. Yeah I have to admit I set
[00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:36.760]   my back my screen background to to pure black because there's an OLED that just
[00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:41.400]   saves you battery. And it looks much frankly it looks much better. It stops all
[00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:46.960]   those sort of weird transglucency things happening. No if you if you want to
[00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:50.440]   screen to look good plus it also hides the fact that you've got these bezels
[00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:54.480]   because they're black as well so it just looks like contiguous. Yeah yeah I
[00:09:54.480 --> 00:10:00.000]   I got white bezels for yeah yeah well that it doesn't help you at all with that.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.600]   I'm another what I guess what I'm saying is despite all the negative
[00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:08.620]   information about the Pixel 2 XL I've been very happy with it I don't have a
[00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:13.240]   problem with the screen. It is the best Android out there now the Note 8 screen
[00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:18.800]   is much better but I think this is a really I like it it's big it's funny it
[00:10:18.800 --> 00:10:24.880]   feels big in the hand compared to the iPhone 10. So then so since I always have
[00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:29.720]   to return something I buy I'm about to cancel the the the Pixel Buds. Yeah
[00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:34.800]   interesting reviews pro and con. Yeah yes but the one thing that bothers me most
[00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:40.680]   is I with my headsets I go back and forth between my tablet my laptop and my
[00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:45.800]   phone. Oh you can't do that. No you can you know it only but pairs to one at a
[00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:50.080]   time and then you have to go reset it and repair every damn time that's
[00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:55.920]   incredibly awful. And they didn't tell us that. No they didn't tell us that's
[00:10:55.920 --> 00:11:00.960]   just that's just awful. Which bothers me quite a bit. I'm guessing it's because
[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:04.960]   it's the new G instant instant easy pairing and they're gonna say it's easy
[00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:08.720]   to pair but it's only easy to pair if you have a pixel A B what I want to
[00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:12.080]   switch over to my. So I got to play you have to put them back in the case you
[00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:16.200]   have to reset according to the reviews you have to repair. Yeah that's not good.
[00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:22.880]   What no way. Every time. Every time. Yes. So put them back in the case. Yes and
[00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:27.800]   I'm going to wait about the case to you need a design degree to figure out how
[00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:31.280]   to get back in the case. They actually have a video they include they have a
[00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:37.000]   video to show you how to get in the case. Jesus. Well and this is the most
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.440]   negative review I read in Gizmodo from Adam Clark Estes. Google's pixel bugs
[00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:47.160]   aren't even close to being good. Because that word one said that the sound was
[00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:50.760]   really good it's just some of the human facts. They were just too hard to use.
[00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:54.280]   Yeah and so this is going to be. It sounded better than the iPod ones but.
[00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:58.120]   That's what the Wired review said which puzzled me. The Wired loved the sound.
[00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:02.160]   They said it was the best sound they'd ever heard Gizmodo said it was terrible.
[00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:06.320]   So part of it is it doesn't they rest on the year they don't actually. Yeah.
[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:11.680]   Yeah. Which does. I can't stand. Well it's the trade over. Do you want isolation or not?
[00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:16.640]   Yeah. I've got I've got Sennheiser ones in which are very isolating at the moment.
[00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:21.000]   And that works when I'm doing this. If I'm cycling I want the low isolation.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:27.360]   That's true. So it's a trade off. That's true. Although the Wired review I think
[00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:32.280]   was the Wired review from David Pierce said that they felt like they were
[00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:35.360]   falling out all the time although they were quite secure but they felt like
[00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:39.920]   that. Does that what you're well. That's probably I have with every single pod.
[00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:44.440]   Yeah. I've got to have stick and or I have to something that goes over the
[00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:51.680]   years and option. Yeah. I got weird ears. Yeah. I'm the same. I can't use lots of
[00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:55.520]   the headphones I can't use because they won't they either fall out or they
[00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:59.840]   hurt if I wear them too long. Well my Pixel Buds come on Friday. I'm gonna I
[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:02.520]   can't cancel them because I got a review and I'll give you my impressions next
[00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:08.880]   week. But yeah I think that this is Google's you know when the Pixel came out
[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:13.800]   last year everybody said well Google was rushed the normal two to your cycle
[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:17.720]   of developing a phone they only had ten months. So wait till the next one that's
[00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:22.080]   gonna be the one that really shows off Google's stuff. And I don't I think this
[00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:27.280]   is not exactly a great launch for the Pixel 2 or the no it's a better device
[00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:31.640]   that it is a launch. Yeah. Yeah I mean I was thinking about getting them but if
[00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:34.360]   you have to put them back in the case reset them. Isn't that what you're just
[00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:38.520]   a pair with the new it's crazy. And it's not a Bluetooth requirement. I have my
[00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:46.760]   Apple AirPods are paired to everything. Yeah. Well I will get them and I can show
[00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:50.920]   you the translation and all that stuff and then you can just try that. Yeah.
[00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:57.440]   Turn another state attorney general going after Google. Joe Josh Holly
[00:13:57.440 --> 00:14:03.720]   attorney general Missouri. Although interesting. Looks like Peter Teal gave
[00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:08.960]   him three hundred thousand dollars for his campaign. What a coincidence. We've seen
[00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:14.680]   this happen before. Apparently states attorneys general are easy to sway. Yeah
[00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:21.600]   Docker was just a you know a a news boost for Teal. Now he's gonna go after Google.
[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:29.600]   So I think Google has slightly deeper pockets. Yeah but the point is that by
[00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:34.880]   effectively we've seen this over and over again. You can effectively bribe
[00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:39.280]   state attorneys general by giving them campaign cash and then they will do
[00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:42.760]   your bidding and go after who you want. In this case an antitrust investigation
[00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:49.160]   against Google. You can do it. I don't think this guy needed any bribing. Maybe not.
[00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:55.040]   I think he sees it as an obvious gambit to get publicity. I mean he's clearly
[00:14:55.040 --> 00:15:01.680]   looking to move up. Yeah it's a first year. You get campaign money and you get
[00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:07.520]   notoriety. It's a win win all around. Right. Right. I mean the idea that Missouri is
[00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:13.080]   gonna lead some kind of regulatory charge against Google is farcical but it
[00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:17.560]   doesn't hurt him to launch the bid right. Why not? Then he looks like a good guy.
[00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:23.840]   He's he's cites the European Union case against Google for favoring their own
[00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:28.960]   product and search results. Of course the EU got a massive fine set a massive fine
[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:34.160]   against Google. His subpoena according to Bloomberg technology is the only
[00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:37.800]   publicly disclosed government antitrust probe against Google in the US since
[00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:46.960]   the FTC picked up and dropped. Remember that case in 2013. Yeah. 2013. Yeah. Now
[00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:53.040]   why is teal? Why does teal have it in for Google? Do you think? That's a good
[00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:57.040]   question because you'd think that he'd be a Silicon Valley is eating itself
[00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:04.680]   right now. You have teal went after Google Parker went after Facebook.
[00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:10.800]   And then and then what's his name the investor also went after Facebook.
[00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:17.080]   Name. Do we talk about Sean Parker? Yeah we did last week I think. You did? Well I
[00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:20.200]   can't remember what I was doing. Didn't this is your life you're talking about it
[00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:24.000]   five times? I know. But that's all right. That's all right. It's a it's part of that
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.920]   larger frightful five conversation that you hate so much. Jeff. But I actually
[00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:35.000]   think you know even though Missouri go ahead Kevin. It's you know it's it's the
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:39.480]   what's shaping what we read conversation. That's that's that's what Parker was
[00:16:39.480 --> 00:16:42.440]   saying. He was he was reading into that and there are a lot of people talking
[00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:47.280]   about that and the problems. He did he did Jeff's favorite moral panic line though.
[00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:50.160]   God only knows what it's doing to our children.
[00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:58.640]   This is Sean Parker the Mr. Rogers of Silicon Valley. Think of the children.
[00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:02.520]   I thought it was interesting he was talking about it from the point of view
[00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:08.040]   of hacking attention and looking at the way that people respond and then
[00:17:08.040 --> 00:17:11.880]   basically hacking that in order to get people to share things and engage as
[00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:15.840]   much as possible. And we know that he said we he said we did it we know we did
[00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:19.720]   it we intentionally did it we knew what we were doing right and it worked and it
[00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:23.960]   works and we know that Facebook does this this is in the sure and it acts
[00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:29.960]   you as everybody does. Roger Mac to me also went after them. Oh Roger Mac well
[00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:33.960]   Madger hates Google. Roger's always on Google. I put it on the run now I can't
[00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:38.240]   find it out but on on on the Guardian how Facebook and Google threatened public
[00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:43.520]   health and democracy. Yeah. Rogers been saying this for years. Well he's on record
[00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:48.960]   as regretting investing. Like he's not sure he regrets his yacht too. Yeah. He
[00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:52.520]   made a lot of money on Facebook. And I'm sure Sean Parker it's easy for Sean
[00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:57.640]   Parker to criticize what Facebook did now that he's a billionaire. Yeah. He says
[00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:02.680]   and this is not unfair if we're trying this is a Roger Mac to me who by the way
[00:18:02.680 --> 00:18:08.320]   mostly now devotes his time to his rock band Moon Alice. It's bad. Yeah. If you're
[00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:11.400]   trying to maintain attention if you're fighting for a share of 24 hours in
[00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:16.160]   people's lives the big issue is you have to keep escalating. That's true. Turns out
[00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:19.200]   the way you keep people's attention is either you scare them or you make them
[00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:23.960]   angry. That's a little reductionist but it is true that stirring emotions is a
[00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:30.560]   great way to engage people. But you know but but but okay so so Silicon Valley got
[00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:33.640]   accused of turning us all into robots and machines and took the humanity out.
[00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:38.120]   So now a company comes along that that has humanity in it and now it's accused
[00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:43.520]   of just of of being terrible and emotions are part of relationships. Of course it
[00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:48.320]   has emotions in it being excited being happy laughing. This is what the entirety
[00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:52.520]   of Hollywood does is emotions. Yeah that's true. I mean I was gonna say that's fine
[00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:55.880]   as long as you don't use it with an intent to manipulate but I guess all
[00:18:55.880 --> 00:19:02.080]   storytelling is ultimately manipulation. Yeah. And 60 minutes and you know the
[00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:08.680]   entire media industry is built. I just love how media goes after an industry
[00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:12.320]   that does it better than it does. That's all. Well and I just recognize. I think
[00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:14.800]   that's the point though Jeff and we talked about this last week is this is
[00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:20.080]   these tools are now weaponized. Go ahead Kevin. Did you cover James
[00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:24.640]   Bridenstine previously? Yes we did. We spent a lot of time last week. Yeah. He's
[00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:28.960]   the guy who wrote the medium piece about these weird YouTube videos that are
[00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:34.880]   essentially algorithmically generated to get revenue by and it worked and by
[00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:40.000]   the way Google is gonna do something about it. Yeah. Which because because
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:45.360]   Briden wrote something. But you know Bridenstine over it is looking at the
[00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:50.400]   weird things that computers do with technology and all. So he's you know he
[00:19:50.400 --> 00:19:54.360]   was he was primed to find that stuff but you know that that piece was genuinely
[00:19:54.360 --> 00:19:58.600]   surprising. It was. We played some of those videos and they were god awful.
[00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:04.920]   It was fascinating because it's it's it's content that's produced by computers
[00:20:04.920 --> 00:20:10.360]   for computers. So it's produced specifically to to tag into specific
[00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:14.680]   keywords. It has no there's no it doesn't matter what the content is. It
[00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:18.840]   just sounds like a lot of T-shirts right. Yeah right. The weird iPhone covers
[00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:22.760]   Bridenstine shows those two. Or keep calm and stay racist or you know it's just
[00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:27.800]   algorithms produce the content and then human beings consume it. Yeah the
[00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:31.520]   differences these were aimed at children who are being not being monitored
[00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:37.880]   while they're mashing the next button. Little like pre-verbal children. Yeah
[00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:42.440]   which is I have to say some of the cartoons we watched when I was a kid
[00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:50.520]   were pretty weird. Roadrunner was creepy as hell. I mean some of them. It wasn't
[00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:56.600]   quite itchy and scratchy but it was pretty weird pants. It's pretty darn weird. All the BBC
[00:20:56.600 --> 00:21:00.040]   TV stuff when I was it was definitely never people and drugs. It was
[00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:04.760]   Teletubbies. Come on really you know magic round about things.
[00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:10.120]   Well I think we can thank LSD for really making the culture.
[00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:14.440]   Definitely. So computers are just recreating
[00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:20.600]   Americans. So Mac to me wrote a opinion piece in the USA Today last actually in
[00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:23.640]   August a couple of months ago he says I had visited. There's a recent one.
[00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:26.440]   Is there more reason? No. Okay. The Guardian. Yeah okay.
[00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:30.840]   Okay but it's the same thrust. I invested early in Google and Facebook now they
[00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:38.760]   terrify me. But I can I can remember Roger talking about this years ago actually.
[00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:42.600]   He's been talking about he's been a little disenchanted with Google for some time.
[00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:46.840]   Definitely. Yeah. How much did he make? I don't know. He
[00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:52.040]   remember he was he ran the Elevation Partners that was Bono's venture fund.
[00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:56.600]   Yeah they lost a fortune on Forbes I think. Well and remember Palm?
[00:21:56.600 --> 00:22:02.120]   Yeah. He was he took a lot of the money that they made and put it into Palm
[00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:06.280]   right when it tanked. Did he run? Yeah. That's right. That's a
[00:22:06.280 --> 00:22:09.640]   wrong clicker. Yeah. Bad decision. Bad bad choice.
[00:22:09.640 --> 00:22:14.280]   I just put the the new piece in the in the chat. Well we all make mistakes.
[00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:20.200]   Here's the there it is. How Facebook? Oh same thing threatened public health
[00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:23.800]   and democracy. I don't know. This is I mean it seems like this is something
[00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:26.360]   it's been an ongoing conversation for some months now on the show.
[00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:31.640]   I do think it's interesting. I was going to say about the Missouri guy so maybe he's not going to
[00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:37.320]   have an impact. But I think something that Google is probably paying attention to quite closely
[00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:45.480]   and probably Facebook is there is a kind of leakage of EU arguments into the US. There's
[00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:49.960]   there are a number of groups in the US that are deliberately taking the same
[00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:54.520]   tack as the EU. There's open markets which used to be part of I think the
[00:22:54.520 --> 00:23:00.680]   New America Foundation or whatever and there was a controversy because they left and Google
[00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:06.440]   may or may not have applied some pressure but there the rhetoric is exactly the same as it was
[00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:12.520]   in the EU. It's exactly the same as commissioners were using. These companies are too big.
[00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:17.720]   They have too much influence. They need to be regulated. And I'm sure that there's lots of
[00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:23.720]   fear in Google and Facebook that some of that is going to have an impact on Congress.
[00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:31.080]   For a moment, let's just visit Kevin Mark's childhood. This is this is called
[00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:36.680]   to this is called fingerbobs. Oh my yuffy lips. Oh man.
[00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:45.240]   This is as weird as those YouTube. Oh this is this is real.
[00:23:45.240 --> 00:23:55.720]   That's wrong. That's just wrong. Oh that is.
[00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:59.800]   For people listening, there's a guy, by the way, wearing a very artsy scarf.
[00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:05.320]   Yeah. Yeah. Making puppets that fit onto his forefinger.
[00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:11.640]   With gloves. I like the sort of 18th century kind of song style in the background.
[00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:14.600]   The two thing I'm not sure I'd let him in a mall.
[00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:18.280]   Oh lord, this is weird. Okay.
[00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:25.800]   A little weird. I did want to mention one thing and and and I'm going to find some silver lining
[00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:30.520]   in this dark cloud somewhere another. So the attorney general, Missouri attorney general,
[00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:38.680]   goes after Google one day later. Our free press in the form of Bloomberg points out that he got
[00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:45.000]   three hundred thousand dollars from Peter Thiel. Increasingly, we're seeing this where corruption
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:51.640]   and there's a god awful amount of it going on is outed almost right away. And and this is of
[00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:57.240]   course why people, you know, some certain people hate the free press, but why we should be very
[00:24:57.240 --> 00:25:01.960]   grateful that we have this free press because they're not idle. I think for the people are not
[00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:08.760]   getting whether it's Harvey Weinstein or, you know, certain other people in the White House,
[00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:13.800]   they're not getting away with stuff like they used to, right? I agree. I hope that's the case.
[00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:22.040]   We don't know. I feel pretty good. I say it's steam, I think, but anyway, yeah, I don't know what
[00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:27.640]   it's right. Who cares? It's fine. Stein would be fine. Stein Stein.
[00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:36.200]   But he'd put out the two things with different battles. It takes less than one news cycle for
[00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:45.320]   there must be and you probably cover this Matthew at CJR, but there must be armies now of investigative
[00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:50.280]   reporters just as soon as something happens going, all right, where's the money? And that's great.
[00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:57.080]   I hope so. I love it. But also where Peter Thiel is involved, there are masses of people
[00:25:57.080 --> 00:26:02.520]   getting on the phone to tell you everything that's bad about some of this is leaking.
[00:26:02.520 --> 00:26:05.640]   Yes. One of the most hated men, probably in Silicon Valley.
[00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:10.840]   It's also let's praise the FEC, the Federal Election Commission and the and the and the
[00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:15.320]   transparency laws, the Sunshine laws in this country that require all campaign contributions,
[00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:21.000]   at least to be publicly recorded, if not limited in any way. At least we know who
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:26.440]   give the money. That's the good news. That's the same organization that everyone wants to
[00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:32.680]   regulate Google and Facebook's election ads. Right. Right. Yeah. You also have.
[00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:37.880]   I have not done. Right. Well, and I argue with Facebook especially, and I've said this in the
[00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:42.360]   show, Prayer Week prior weeks, is that they should be setting an entirely new aggressive standard
[00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:46.280]   in transparency. They should go beyond anyone's expectations and transparency.
[00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:51.640]   And that's their opportunity. They're still playing defense. They've got to play moral offense.
[00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:55.400]   Well, in Facebook, they're not doing it. Actually, to be fair, Facebook has done
[00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:58.840]   has done pretty well. They've got a long way, but they've been trying.
[00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:04.920]   It was. Yeah. But that was actually, I was surprised they went as far as they did.
[00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:11.080]   By the way, sometimes Bloomberg literally follows the money. Here's our secretary of the treasury.
[00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:15.640]   Love those. Steve Mnuchin. Right. Right. Great photos. Ben Schwartz,
[00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:21.640]   with his gloss on this is quite awesome. Steve Mnuchin, down at the mint,
[00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:27.400]   picking up his staff's Christmas bonus. And it's a Mnuchin and his model wife, Louise Linton,
[00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:33.560]   holding up a uncut page of dollar pills at the mint. John Avarosas is asking,
[00:27:33.560 --> 00:27:39.880]   our Avosas is asking for a caption contest. And my favorite is, "Dear, we've found our new wallpaper."
[00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:46.040]   Wow. What was that dollar bills? I mean, it goes cheap.
[00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:49.240]   Yeah. What's the cheap out here? What's the cash at Christmas?
[00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:56.600]   Who was it? Wasn't it? Didn't Steve Wozniak used to carry around sheets of bills?
[00:27:56.600 --> 00:28:01.480]   Yeah. In fact, I have pictures of him doing this. Well, what do we do a variety of things?
[00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:06.600]   So you can buy, it turns out, who knew that you can buy sheets of two dollar bills.
[00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:10.440]   And so he would actually just carry, sometimes carry the sheets. And when somebody asks for money,
[00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:15.080]   he'd take a scissors and cut it and give it to them. And then he-
[00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:20.680]   His legal tender. He would say things that were weird, intentionally hoping that these people would
[00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:26.760]   call the Secret Service on them saying, "He's passing bad money." Then he got him made up into a pad
[00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:33.240]   so he could tear them off. I love Woz. I love Woz.
[00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:39.640]   All right. Let's take a little break. This is fun. I'm having a good time. I hope you are too.
[00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:45.080]   We've got the return of Matthew Ingram. Now it is New Gig at the Columbia Journalism Review.
[00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:53.800]   Matthew I am a T-H-E-W-I-1-T on the Twitter. Kevin Marks, I'm just going to pretend you're in
[00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:56.520]   your local pub, if you don't mind. He is-
[00:28:56.520 --> 00:29:02.520]   Okay. It's one plane ride from North Yorkshire to Amsterdam.
[00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:05.400]   It's probably really easy to get to Amsterdam for you, isn't it? It's like a-
[00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:10.280]   There's a local airport. This is like the smallest airport in the UK,
[00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:13.800]   but it flies to Amsterdam. So if I go to a proper Amsterdam, it's absolutely perfect.
[00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:15.720]   Now I know why you're out. It's hard work.
[00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:17.560]   Yeah, you live in the moor. It's because it's easy.
[00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:18.360]   It's under Fox, probably.
[00:29:18.360 --> 00:29:21.800]   Yeah, but there's no bathroom.
[00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:26.120]   It has a crane station that the trains don't stop at.
[00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:29.560]   Nice. Those are hands.
[00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:32.840]   I can get the train there. No, it doesn't actually stop that.
[00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:33.400]   That's okay.
[00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:35.640]   That's so strange. That is so funny.
[00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:39.880]   Let's take a break. Our show today brought to you-
[00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:42.680]   Oh, and I should have mentioned Jeff Jarvis. I didn't mean to leave you out.
[00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:44.440]   Jeff Jarvis is also your Buzz Machine.
[00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:46.200]   Buzz Machine.
[00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:46.200]   Buzz Machine.
[00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:47.080]   Buzz, I'm here.
[00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:47.560]   Oh, wake up.
[00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:52.920]   No, I'm really glad that you're here, Jeff, because you
[00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:57.960]   are, I think, a very good balance to all-
[00:29:57.960 --> 00:30:00.040]   It's very easy to say the frightful five.
[00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:02.600]   You're a good balance to this.
[00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:08.680]   I've been all week reminding myself of the benefits we get from technology and these companies.
[00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:16.440]   The Guardian, which is paper I've logged, has gone full techno panic.
[00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:20.040]   And today was at the four-square conference, which is all off the record.
[00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:23.480]   I'm not supposed to say anything, but suffice it to say this.
[00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:30.520]   There were conservative executives on stage wanting regulation of Google and Facebook.
[00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:33.960]   And this is scary.
[00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:36.840]   And the technology people who were there, they're still a little clueless.
[00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:39.560]   Like, "Oh, well, you don't like us? Well, what do we do?"
[00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:45.240]   And though I tend to agree with them, I argue this is where Matthew,
[00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:45.720]   you're right.
[00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:51.400]   Facebook went a big step on this, but they've got to shock us with their virtue.
[00:30:51.400 --> 00:30:55.400]   They've got to go, they've got to get so far ahead of this, and they're still playing catch-up.
[00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:58.680]   There's a wave of regulation coming.
[00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:00.760]   Oh, I'm afraid so.
[00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:02.120]   There's a wave.
[00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:05.400]   And as Eric Schmidt always says, "Okay, okay, what do you want government to do?
[00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:07.240]   Do you want government to hold all your data?"
[00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:08.840]   Right.
[00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:11.640]   You want government to decide how we do our job?
[00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:13.080]   You want what do you want?
[00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:14.840]   That's what it means to say that government does this.
[00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:15.320]   That's what it means.
[00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:18.440]   A part of what, I mean, Google and Facebook are going to have to say,
[00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:21.800]   they can't just keep saying like they did in front of Congress,
[00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:27.480]   "Oh, it's really complicated to do what you're saying, to track down Russians who are buying
[00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:28.040]   election ads."
[00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:30.040]   That's not, that answer is not going to fly.
[00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:31.880]   It didn't fly in front of Congress.
[00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:32.360]   They also, you're right.
[00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:33.960]   It didn't fly in front of Congress.
[00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:36.200]   It's not going to buy them anything but time.
[00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:38.200]   And that was the problem.
[00:31:38.200 --> 00:31:39.000]   Sorry, Matthew.
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.960]   The other problem is that when Congress says something stupid,
[00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:44.440]   they're so cowed they can't say that's dumb.
[00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:46.760]   You know, and Alfred, can I like, but the whole,
[00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:48.840]   "How did you not see the ads in rubles?"
[00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:50.440]   Because it wasn't just what we were looking for.
[00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:51.720]   As far as it goes.
[00:31:51.720 --> 00:31:52.360]   Come on, Senator.
[00:31:52.360 --> 00:31:54.360]   I mean, but they can't say it because of the count.
[00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:55.880]   But he's great with the soundbite.
[00:31:55.880 --> 00:32:02.200]   You know, and I know, sitting, I went and sat and threw those hearings,
[00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:05.480]   like seven hours of Senate and congressional hearings.
[00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:07.480]   A lot of it is theater, right there.
[00:32:07.480 --> 00:32:08.040]   It's all right.
[00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:08.840]   And that's very much like that.
[00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:10.440]   And that's very much a soundbite.
[00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:13.000]   All right, so I interrupted you, Leo.
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:13.720]   I took you off.
[00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:14.920]   You were going to go and make some money.
[00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:16.440]   Oh, just we're going to go on a break.
[00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:18.600]   Actually, I was going to thank our great sponsors,
[00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:24.280]   Sonic, who literally bring you this show on our 10 gigabit fiber internet.
[00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:27.240]   They are our service provider and they ought to be yours.
[00:32:27.240 --> 00:32:29.800]   If you're lucky enough to live in Northern California,
[00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:36.920]   Sonic is bringing internet freedom to all with unlimited, uncapped internet.
[00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:38.600]   They stand up for privacy.
[00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:41.720]   They have local customer support and they're pricing.
[00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:45.800]   Well, it just shows that the other guys are raking you over the coals.
[00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:50.520]   Here's what you get with Sonic internet, 15 email accounts,
[00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:53.400]   a gigabyte of storage, personal web hosting,
[00:32:53.400 --> 00:32:57.080]   a new domain name of your very own choosing, a fax line service,
[00:32:57.080 --> 00:33:02.760]   a home phone connection with unlimited local and long distance calling.
[00:33:02.760 --> 00:33:03.720]   It's a real phone too.
[00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:09.480]   You can port your phone number to it and speeds up to 1000 megabits per second,
[00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:12.120]   gigabit for $40 a month.
[00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:14.440]   How much do you pay those other guys for service?
[00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:15.080]   It's not as good.
[00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:16.120]   The service is capped.
[00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:19.160]   And those other guys don't stand up for your privacy.
[00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:19.880]   Sonic does.
[00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:20.760]   I love Sonic.
[00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:23.080]   I hope you can get it.
[00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:30.600]   If not, I feel bad about doing this ad, but at least you know there's something better possible.
[00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:31.080]   Right?
[00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:31.800]   That's the point.
[00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:33.400]   sonic.com/twit.
[00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:37.560]   Receive your first month of Sonic internet phone service for free.
[00:33:37.560 --> 00:33:38.520]   Plus bundle it with this.
[00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:40.520]   You'll save $120 on your sonic bill.
[00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:45.000]   sonic.com/twit.
[00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:51.720]   Well, there's one fewer members, a member of the Inkstained Wretch Society,
[00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:53.960]   the fifth, the fourth estate.
[00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:55.480]   Are they the fifth of the fourth estate?
[00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:56.760]   Who's the fifth estate?
[00:33:56.760 --> 00:33:57.640]   They're the fourth.
[00:33:57.640 --> 00:33:59.720]   I think Google and Facebook.
[00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:00.840]   And they're the fifth estate.
[00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:03.240]   Now we have a fifth estate.
[00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:03.560]   There you go.
[00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:04.600]   The fifth estate.
[00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:08.120]   The fourth estate is losing a a proud member.
[00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:14.200]   Nick Bilton is columnist turned screenwriter just sold his screenplay,
[00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:14.920]   The Bunker.
[00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:22.200]   I guess he's still a Vanity Fair, but he's going to be doing a movie on Amazon, Amazon Studios.
[00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:26.600]   It follows a group of billionaires who seeks luxury,
[00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:31.560]   seeks shelter in a luxurious underground bunker after devastating attack.
[00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:32.760]   Cripples America.
[00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:37.560]   We've seen these are real bunkers and the rich own many of them.
[00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:42.920]   One of them is a converted nuclear missile silo in the Midwest
[00:34:42.920 --> 00:34:45.640]   that's been turned into million dollar condominiums
[00:34:45.640 --> 00:34:48.360]   with their own air supply medical facilities.
[00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:52.840]   I think it's a great starting point for a show.
[00:34:52.840 --> 00:34:56.440]   As their worst instincts come to the surface,
[00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:59.960]   they realize it takes more than money to survive.
[00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:01.800]   So good going.
[00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:02.920]   That's like a Black Mirror episode.
[00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:03.640]   I know.
[00:35:03.640 --> 00:35:04.360]   Good going, Nick.
[00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:04.920]   I'm very...
[00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:07.960]   Nick's last book should have been made into a movie.
[00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:10.440]   Unfortunately, I don't think it was being based on his book.
[00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:11.000]   It was great.
[00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:15.480]   American Kimpin has been optioned by Joel and Ethan Cohen.
[00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:16.280]   Oh, it has.
[00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:17.000]   Okay, good.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:17.400]   Really?
[00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:18.120]   And he's got...
[00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:18.760]   It's a great story.
[00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:20.040]   "Hatchin' Twitter" has been...
[00:35:20.040 --> 00:35:21.240]   which is his Twitter story.
[00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:28.200]   American Kingpin was the Silk Road story about what's his name that was arrested for
[00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:32.440]   running the dark web, black market and drugs.
[00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:38.600]   His book about Twitter, "Hatchin' Twitter" has been optioned by Lionsgate for television.
[00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:42.440]   Did I often don't agree with Nick about things, but he's a hell of a storyteller.
[00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:42.840]   He is.
[00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:45.160]   And I like that he did a great job.
[00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:47.160]   It just means we're never getting him on our shows again.
[00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:47.640]   But anyway...
[00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:50.600]   I like seeing him success.
[00:35:50.600 --> 00:35:51.400]   That's great.
[00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:52.040]   It's great.
[00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:52.600]   Yeah.
[00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:53.240]   Mazel tov.
[00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:53.720]   Mazel tov.
[00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:54.440]   Nick built him.
[00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:56.440]   Let's see.
[00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:57.400]   "Cory Ducturize"
[00:35:57.400 --> 00:35:58.920]   "Where the system bins rule the earth one?"
[00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:02.200]   When they make that into a TV show, I will watch.
[00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:03.720]   That will be cool.
[00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:06.200]   "Cory" deserves that success.
[00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:07.160]   He really does.
[00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:07.240]   He does.
[00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:10.600]   He has enough things that could be filmed.
[00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:11.480]   You should get on that.
[00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:12.040]   Oh yeah.
[00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:17.000]   "He'll be like Philip K. Dick," I'm sad to say, who wasn't discovered until after his death,
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:21.960]   and then whose short stories were the foundation for pretty much every science fiction movie you ever loved.
[00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:21.960]   Yep.
[00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:22.920]   Uh, cool.
[00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:25.480]   But they are filming good omen's.
[00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:27.080]   "Cory's not nearly as crazy as Bill Love."
[00:36:27.080 --> 00:36:27.640]   She's very cool.
[00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:29.000]   Say again, Kevin, what are they filming?
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:30.760]   "Good omen's."
[00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:31.720]   Oh!
[00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:32.760]   But that's a Neil Gaiman.
[00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:33.160]   Yes.
[00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:35.560]   But Neil's done all right for himself.
[00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:36.120]   Yeah.
[00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:38.120]   No, it's Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett.
[00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:38.520]   Terry Pratchett.
[00:36:38.520 --> 00:36:43.080]   They wrote a book together before they were famous, which is like this.
[00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:44.600]   And if you haven't read it, you have to read it.
[00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:45.080]   It's good.
[00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:46.840]   Oh, so I didn't realize "Good Omen's" was that old.
[00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:47.400]   I love it.
[00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:51.960]   So it was before either of them was famous.
[00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:55.000]   I think Pratchett had written like the first three walls before.
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:56.360]   "We're in Dead Disc World" by then.
[00:36:56.360 --> 00:36:57.000]   That took off.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:57.480]   Yeah.
[00:36:57.480 --> 00:37:02.520]   And Gaiman was still doing comics, so he was kind of famous.
[00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:05.560]   But neither of them had broken out as a film.
[00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:06.440]   Famous for Sandman.
[00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:06.760]   Yeah.
[00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:07.240]   Yeah.
[00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:08.200]   So there...
[00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:10.520]   I think, yeah, my input predates Sandman.
[00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:11.640]   I think it was really similar to Sandman.
[00:37:11.640 --> 00:37:12.200]   Oh, okay.
[00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:17.800]   Well, American Gods was an interesting adaptation, very faithful to the book,
[00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:20.280]   but not a great TV show on stars.
[00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:21.560]   So...
[00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:22.680]   I was thinking it worked, but...
[00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:25.240]   It was not Mass Appeal.
[00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:28.040]   I think it was very dark and difficult for a lot of people.
[00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:28.360]   Yeah.
[00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:29.000]   I liked it.
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:30.920]   I thought it was really good.
[00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:31.240]   Yeah.
[00:37:31.240 --> 00:37:32.520]   I think they managed to preserve.
[00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:37.720]   Well, the thing is, the challenge always was you had to make a film with it.
[00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:41.320]   And Gaiman has written about this at length when they were trying to auction Sandman
[00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:44.360]   and then squish it down to an hour and a half, which doesn't work.
[00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:44.920]   Yeah.
[00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:49.560]   As a sort of multi-year Amazon thing, yes, that worked really well.
[00:37:49.560 --> 00:37:51.800]   And American Gods has that potential.
[00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:52.280]   He's...
[00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:55.480]   They're about a quarter of the way through it, with that first series.
[00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:56.040]   Right, right.
[00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:57.960]   I was very sad when it ended.
[00:37:57.960 --> 00:38:00.120]   I thought, "Wait, there's a lot more than..."
[00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:01.720]   There's a lot more.
[00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:06.280]   And actually, I was talking to someone the other day about how the way people watch
[00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:12.280]   things now, people binge watching 6, 7, 8, 9 episodes of a show.
[00:38:12.280 --> 00:38:12.840]   Right.
[00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:14.920]   That's way longer than a movie.
[00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:17.720]   And you have people who are more than happy to sit down and watch
[00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:20.120]   three, four hours of TV, if it's good enough.
[00:38:20.120 --> 00:38:20.600]   Oh, yeah.
[00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:21.720]   Oh, no.
[00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:24.760]   We watched two series of Stranger Things in the front in the short amount of...
[00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:25.240]   Yeah, me too.
[00:38:25.240 --> 00:38:27.320]   Because it was this...
[00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:30.600]   They had the space to do that well constructed thing.
[00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:31.080]   Yeah.
[00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:34.920]   So, it was, yes, it was fearful of moving nostalgia,
[00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:38.280]   but it was drawn out over the length that you could actually develop characters.
[00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:39.240]   And it was beautiful.
[00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:39.800]   Exactly.
[00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:40.600]   And it ends...
[00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:42.760]   We watched it on the way to Munich and back.
[00:38:42.760 --> 00:38:43.400]   The second season.
[00:38:43.400 --> 00:38:43.560]   Yeah.
[00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:49.160]   Well, Good Omens is being done by BBC Studios in conjunction with Amazon.
[00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:53.880]   Dr. Who Fans Will Be Very Pleased to know that David Tennant has been cast,
[00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:56.840]   along with Michael Sheen in the lead role.
[00:38:56.840 --> 00:38:59.240]   So two very good actors.
[00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:01.240]   It should be a lot of fun.
[00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:02.440]   Oh, they've got a great cast.
[00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:03.240]   Yeah.
[00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:04.520]   It will be out next year.
[00:39:04.520 --> 00:39:06.120]   And by the way...
[00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:06.840]   She's a...
[00:39:06.840 --> 00:39:09.880]   ...gammon has scripted the show, which is good news.
[00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:10.440]   Oh, he's...
[00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:10.920]   He was...
[00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:10.920]   He was...
[00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:10.920]   He was...
[00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:11.400]   ...running...
[00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:11.720]   Yeah.
[00:39:11.720 --> 00:39:14.360]   He's a show where he was very involved in American Gods too, I think.
[00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:15.480]   Yeah.
[00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:16.440]   No, this...
[00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:17.880]   This plays very well to him because...
[00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:22.200]   And, you know, he had the problem that his staff was option by Hollywood.
[00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:23.640]   He'd rewritten by somebody else.
[00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:24.680]   It would be made terrible.
[00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:29.400]   And this new model of, okay, we'll give you six hours,
[00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:30.360]   what can you do with that?
[00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:33.000]   Fits him much better.
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   And I'm looking forward to seeing America.
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:42.440]   I mean, American Gods, it was supposed to be directed by Terry Gilliam about 10 years ago.
[00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:43.240]   Oh, that would have been...
[00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:43.560]   Wow.
[00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:43.880]   Right.
[00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:45.320]   Which...
[00:39:45.320 --> 00:39:48.280]   But they couldn't quite get it completely funded and completely...
[00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:52.040]   But I think this would have been better because that would have been cut down to two hours.
[00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:57.080]   And that story has enough in it that it can carry the mini-series space.
[00:39:57.080 --> 00:40:01.160]   How many things does Terry Gilliam supposed to have directed?
[00:40:01.160 --> 00:40:01.480]   Yeah.
[00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:01.880]   Like there's...
[00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:06.200]   There's gotta be dozens of projects that he was gonna do and never did.
[00:40:06.200 --> 00:40:09.000]   There's some hitch in his giddy-up we don't know.
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:09.480]   I didn't never hear...
[00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:10.760]   He's an unusual man.
[00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:12.120]   Maybe that's it.
[00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:12.440]   Yeah.
[00:40:12.440 --> 00:40:16.760]   They recently released "Japper Walkie" with a new clean print.
[00:40:16.760 --> 00:40:19.080]   Oh, that'd be a good Blu-ray date.
[00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:20.280]   Vintage weirdness.
[00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:20.520]   Yeah.
[00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:22.280]   They...
[00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:25.880]   Speaking of deals, did you see the Lord of the Rings, the Amazon feel for...
[00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:27.560]   Amazon got very busy in the last...
[00:40:27.560 --> 00:40:29.080]   $250 million.
[00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:30.280]   And...
[00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:31.480]   That's just for the rights.
[00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:32.840]   It's not even the story.
[00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:34.360]   It's the rights to...
[00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:35.240]   Just the rights.
[00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:38.200]   The world because they're gonna be prequels.
[00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:39.480]   Right.
[00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:41.320]   So they don't even have anything in development.
[00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:44.920]   They haven't even started like even pre-production on anything.
[00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:47.160]   And they've already spent $250 million.
[00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:48.120]   Quarter of a billion...
[00:40:48.120 --> 00:40:49.320]   That's mind-boggling.
[00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:49.800]   The rights.
[00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:52.040]   Who gets all that money?
[00:40:52.040 --> 00:40:54.280]   J.R.R. Tolkien's great-great-grandson?
[00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:54.440]   Yep.
[00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:55.960]   Christavast.
[00:40:55.960 --> 00:40:56.840]   Just been talking, yeah.
[00:40:56.840 --> 00:40:58.360]   That's his son, right?
[00:40:58.360 --> 00:40:59.080]   Christopher.
[00:40:59.080 --> 00:40:59.320]   Yeah.
[00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:00.600]   Wow.
[00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:02.120]   And his kids' beauty.
[00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:03.560]   That's a mind-boggling amount of money.
[00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:03.880]   Yeah.
[00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:04.360]   Well...
[00:41:04.360 --> 00:41:05.320]   For rights.
[00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:06.280]   Probably worth it.
[00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:07.320]   And it's less...
[00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:07.800]   Oh, yeah.
[00:41:07.800 --> 00:41:08.360]   It's more than...
[00:41:08.360 --> 00:41:09.080]   Let's put it this way.
[00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:11.240]   It's more than Jeff Bezos paid for the Washington Post.
[00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:15.560]   But think about the number of people that can't help with that money.
[00:41:15.560 --> 00:41:17.880]   Think about nobody in Hollywood could come up with that kind of money.
[00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:19.320]   When you're the richest man in the world,
[00:41:19.320 --> 00:41:21.400]   right? How are you going to compete with the richest man in the world?
[00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:21.720]   Exactly.
[00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:26.600]   I mean, I heard today that Netflix spends $17 billion on programming.
[00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:28.280]   HBO spends about $2.5 billion.
[00:41:28.280 --> 00:41:28.920]   Yeah.
[00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:29.080]   Yeah.
[00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:32.040]   And Apple thinks it's all in with a billion dollars.
[00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:33.320]   And that just shows you...
[00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:34.040]   You're not even...
[00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:35.640]   That's not even table stakes.
[00:41:35.640 --> 00:41:36.520]   Oh, I could change.
[00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:38.920]   And this new world, this world of peak TV.
[00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:41.320]   Do you wish you would go back to reviewing TV, Jeff?
[00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:42.520]   No.
[00:41:42.520 --> 00:41:43.800]   It's the golden age.
[00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:45.240]   There's a platinum age.
[00:41:45.240 --> 00:41:45.640]   It's funny.
[00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:46.920]   I think it's the most...
[00:41:46.920 --> 00:41:49.160]   The year coming, they're going to spend $9 billion.
[00:41:49.880 --> 00:41:51.320]   That's amazing.
[00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:53.960]   LinkedIn recommended a job to me the other day.
[00:41:53.960 --> 00:41:55.960]   Edward, have a weekly magazine.
[00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:57.800]   I started his hiring a TV critic and I said,
[00:41:57.800 --> 00:41:58.680]   "I'm Twitter, should I apply?"
[00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:01.000]   That'd be fun.
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:01.640]   That'd be fun.
[00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:07.720]   Somebody says the first episode of the new Lord of the Rings series on Amazon
[00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:10.040]   is called Tom Bombadil Goes to Washington.
[00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:11.160]   So I...
[00:42:11.160 --> 00:42:14.440]   Good ones, Efra.
[00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:15.240]   That's in the chat room.
[00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:17.720]   Someone said that they had a treatment.
[00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:20.040]   It was Mordor he wrote.
[00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:25.480]   Oh, let the puns begin.
[00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:26.040]   I love it.
[00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:31.560]   Google Home is now turned into an intercom.
[00:42:31.560 --> 00:42:34.200]   I don't know anybody.
[00:42:34.200 --> 00:42:36.120]   I have echoes in every room.
[00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:38.520]   And I do use it as a room-to-room intercom.
[00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:42.920]   But now the Google Home has turned on this broadcast mode
[00:42:42.920 --> 00:42:45.560]   where you can say, "Tell everybody in the house."
[00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:47.080]   Like God Mode.
[00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:49.000]   Dinner is served.
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:50.600]   In every room of the house.
[00:42:50.600 --> 00:42:51.720]   I could use that.
[00:42:51.720 --> 00:42:52.360]   Yes.
[00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:52.680]   Yeah.
[00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:53.160]   I could use it.
[00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:54.520]   I don't know.
[00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:58.360]   I mean, for me, this is like peak Silicon Valley,
[00:42:58.360 --> 00:42:59.480]   rich people problem thing.
[00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:02.680]   It's like, if you could afford a house in Silicon Valley,
[00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:05.400]   where you need more than one Google thingy?
[00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:07.960]   In every room you need it.
[00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:10.280]   Yeah, you need that doesn't at least.
[00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:12.600]   I am not put out by the pool.
[00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:15.320]   I have not yet reached peak Google Home.
[00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:16.840]   I'm all in on the echoes.
[00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:19.320]   I have them in every room, but I don't have Google Homes in every room.
[00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:22.920]   I dread the day that I have to have one of each in every room.
[00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:24.120]   That's what seems to be coming.
[00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:26.440]   Well, the great thing now is that Black Friday,
[00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:28.280]   they're both going to compete for better prices.
[00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:31.240]   Yeah, in fact, the kind of-
[00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:32.200]   They do to each other.
[00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:38.040]   The sad little lonely Cortana device,
[00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:39.560]   the invoke from Heart and Garden,
[00:43:39.560 --> 00:43:41.160]   has been cut in half for Black Friday.
[00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:42.120]   It's $100.
[00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:43.240]   Wow.
[00:43:43.240 --> 00:43:44.920]   It needs to be to compete, frankly.
[00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:45.720]   Here's Google.
[00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:50.280]   Here's the image Google published of this new feature.
[00:43:50.280 --> 00:43:54.520]   It's time to leave for school coming out of speakers in every room of the house.
[00:43:54.520 --> 00:43:56.120]   Wow.
[00:43:56.120 --> 00:43:57.880]   Wow.
[00:43:57.880 --> 00:43:58.600]   You're right.
[00:43:58.600 --> 00:44:00.600]   This is the ultimate first world price.
[00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:01.480]   Not even first world.
[00:44:01.480 --> 00:44:02.760]   We need a new name for it.
[00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:04.520]   Silicon Valley problem.
[00:44:04.520 --> 00:44:08.600]   It's the same thing as like,
[00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:12.280]   whoa, we don't actually track how buses work,
[00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:15.800]   because all our buses just go from our house to our workplace.
[00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:16.360]   To their work.
[00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:20.520]   Like, Google Maps doesn't understand the idea of changing buses.
[00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:24.680]   In particular, if you're on a bus-
[00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:27.160]   Doesn't that just take you to work?
[00:44:27.160 --> 00:44:28.920]   Don't you have Wi-Fi and leather seats?
[00:44:28.920 --> 00:44:29.400]   Come on.
[00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:30.360]   It just takes you to work.
[00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:32.520]   Is there a chef in the back making you some special-
[00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:35.160]   That's scrambled eggs in the morning.
[00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:36.680]   You're on a bus.
[00:44:36.680 --> 00:44:37.880]   You're like, can I make a connection?
[00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:42.040]   It says, walk 200 yards back and get the bus behind you.
[00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:43.480]   I'm on the bus.
[00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:45.000]   Can you not tell this?
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:48.840]   Buses are complicated, Kevin.
[00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:50.440]   They are.
[00:44:50.440 --> 00:44:52.520]   Some ways are a lot easier than trash.
[00:44:52.520 --> 00:44:54.840]   Buses are easier than subways.
[00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:59.080]   Subways are actually not underground out of Wi-Fi and cell phone range.
[00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:01.800]   Buses, there are four of us on there with our phones.
[00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:04.600]   You can tell we're all moving at the same speed, at the same time.
[00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:05.320]   Is that, oh, right?
[00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:06.200]   You're on that bus.
[00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:08.200]   Actually, it's a good one.
[00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:09.240]   So the Google Home Mini-
[00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:10.040]   You can solve this.
[00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:14.760]   Is $19 Google Black Friday.
[00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:19.720]   Echo Dot, Black Friday is $29.99 down from $49.99.
[00:45:19.720 --> 00:45:22.920]   So for $20, you can have it's a donut.
[00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:23.800]   You can do the-
[00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:24.520]   Yeah.
[00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:25.480]   And-
[00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:26.440]   That is pretty cheap.
[00:45:26.440 --> 00:45:27.320]   Tell me if it is it.
[00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:27.880]   I can't remember.
[00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:28.360]   Does it-
[00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:31.960]   I have one coming because all of us who bought Pixel 2 XLs have one coming.
[00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:37.160]   But does it have a speaker built in or do I have to pair it to a speaker for it to work?
[00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:38.040]   No, a speaker built in.
[00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:38.520]   It does have a-
[00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:39.000]   Sure.
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:39.560]   Probably 10.
[00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:40.840]   What do you mean you have one coming?
[00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:42.120]   Do you get one with your Pixel?
[00:45:42.120 --> 00:45:42.360]   Yeah.
[00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:43.640]   Oh.
[00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:44.200]   If you pre-
[00:45:44.200 --> 00:45:46.760]   I can't remember if it was a pre-order deal or whatever.
[00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:50.760]   This finally came because it's the Panda color with a little orange button.
[00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:51.880]   That those are hard to get.
[00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:53.640]   Oh, that's why it took so long.
[00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:55.800]   Oh, did you get your Pixel book?
[00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:56.920]   I love my Pixel book.
[00:45:56.920 --> 00:45:58.360]   Do you?
[00:45:58.360 --> 00:46:00.440]   Well, I'll tell you what's wrong with the Pixel book.
[00:46:00.440 --> 00:46:03.640]   It's pretty good, besides the price, which is absurd.
[00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:04.360]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:06.520]   A thousand dollars for a Chromebook.
[00:46:06.520 --> 00:46:07.320]   Is it's got-
[00:46:07.320 --> 00:46:09.320]   Everything's getting rid of bezels all of a sudden.
[00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:11.640]   It's got these massive bezels.
[00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:13.560]   Because if it's a tablet,
[00:46:13.560 --> 00:46:15.000]   it's the argument.
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:16.280]   You need something to hang on to.
[00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:18.280]   Yeah, well, they don't have to be like-
[00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:18.840]   For dear like.
[00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:20.520]   Yeah, I agree with you.
[00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:21.480]   The other problem is-
[00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:21.720]   That price-
[00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:26.200]   So I was going to take this with me on this trip tonight,
[00:46:26.200 --> 00:46:28.840]   but trying to download shows onto it.
[00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:32.360]   So Jeff's chronic complaint,
[00:46:32.360 --> 00:46:34.120]   because I have the apps account,
[00:46:34.120 --> 00:46:35.880]   or the G Suite.
[00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:36.440]   Oh, forget it.
[00:46:36.440 --> 00:46:38.520]   So long ago,
[00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:41.800]   when you couldn't do Google Play on G Suite,
[00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:43.400]   so I still have it on my other account.
[00:46:43.400 --> 00:46:45.480]   So I have to go to the other account to do Google Play.
[00:46:45.480 --> 00:46:47.400]   And then Netflix,
[00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:48.680]   I got operating on the other account.
[00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:49.800]   That worked okay.
[00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:52.440]   But then I can't do Amazon video,
[00:46:52.440 --> 00:46:53.560]   because with Amazon video,
[00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:55.800]   you got to reload the Amazon app.
[00:46:55.800 --> 00:46:57.800]   And it won't let you do that on the Pixel book,
[00:46:57.800 --> 00:46:59.880]   unless you go in a developer mode.
[00:46:59.880 --> 00:47:03.560]   So it's not a full tablet.
[00:47:03.560 --> 00:47:04.520]   It's a mess-
[00:47:04.520 --> 00:47:05.160]   That's frustrating.
[00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:05.720]   I'm sorry.
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:08.760]   I'm just going to be using the apps, Leo.
[00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:13.000]   I have in the past on other Chromebooks.
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:14.200]   You mean Android apps?
[00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:18.120]   Yeah, because I thought the Pixel book was better for that,
[00:47:18.120 --> 00:47:20.360]   or that they'd gotten more integrated or-
[00:47:20.360 --> 00:47:22.280]   Pretty much the same as others.
[00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:23.080]   Yeah, it feels-
[00:47:23.080 --> 00:47:24.680]   It's just Chrome OS.
[00:47:24.680 --> 00:47:25.240]   Yeah.
[00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:28.680]   I think I use one or two apps that I use HipChat,
[00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:29.960]   because that's an Android app.
[00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:31.960]   It's a little easier to use that on as an app.
[00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:33.240]   I actually dislike going-
[00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:34.440]   So New York Times,
[00:47:34.440 --> 00:47:35.720]   if the choice of going to the app,
[00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:38.760]   or going to the web version,
[00:47:38.760 --> 00:47:40.280]   I far prefer the web version.
[00:47:40.280 --> 00:47:41.400]   Well, for one thing,
[00:47:41.400 --> 00:47:43.880]   all these apps launch in Android-
[00:47:43.880 --> 00:47:44.200]   Right.
[00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:45.240]   sized page.
[00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:45.880]   I need Windows, yeah.
[00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:47.000]   And then if you want to expand it,
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:48.360]   it says, "Okay, but I'm going to restart."
[00:47:48.360 --> 00:47:49.560]   If you want to go to full screen,
[00:47:49.560 --> 00:47:50.920]   it's like, "Well, uh-
[00:47:50.920 --> 00:47:52.200]   but I guess-
[00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:53.720]   I thought maybe they'd fix that."
[00:47:53.720 --> 00:47:55.080]   Well, I think from then on,
[00:47:55.080 --> 00:47:56.120]   right, it'll be full-screener.
[00:47:56.120 --> 00:47:56.600]   I don't know.
[00:47:56.600 --> 00:47:57.800]   It's like-
[00:47:57.800 --> 00:47:58.600]   I know those-
[00:47:58.600 --> 00:47:59.480]   I know those happen with me,
[00:47:59.480 --> 00:48:00.760]   but that's frustrating.
[00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:03.720]   So you're saying it's black,
[00:48:03.720 --> 00:48:06.040]   because right now the Google Home Mini is 50 bucks,
[00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:06.920]   but at 20 bucks-
[00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:08.440]   and this is going to be on Black Friday-
[00:48:08.440 --> 00:48:09.960]   Yeah, let me put the-
[00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:11.080]   That's a life-out for who-
[00:48:11.080 --> 00:48:11.880]   At 20 bucks.
[00:48:11.880 --> 00:48:16.520]   And you get a $35 Chromecast.
[00:48:16.520 --> 00:48:18.920]   That's a really interesting combination.
[00:48:18.920 --> 00:48:20.120]   I just put the link up.
[00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:21.720]   Because it talks to the Chromecast.
[00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:23.160]   You could say, "Hey, you know-
[00:48:23.160 --> 00:48:24.120]   You get a Chromecast?"
[00:48:24.120 --> 00:48:26.840]   Yeah, if you don't already have one in every TV-
[00:48:26.840 --> 00:48:27.320]   Go ahead.
[00:48:27.320 --> 00:48:27.800]   Right.
[00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:29.960]   Then you can put-
[00:48:29.960 --> 00:48:30.520]   I don't need anyone.
[00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:31.800]   I can't watch my cousin so-
[00:48:31.800 --> 00:48:32.200]   I know.
[00:48:32.200 --> 00:48:33.400]   I mean, I have him lying around.
[00:48:33.400 --> 00:48:33.880]   I bought some-
[00:48:33.880 --> 00:48:35.720]   [laughs]
[00:48:35.720 --> 00:48:36.600]   For the life-out for-
[00:48:36.600 --> 00:48:38.920]   You were wrong because the Netflix deal with you.
[00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:40.040]   Yeah.
[00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:41.560]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:48:41.560 --> 00:48:46.680]   I got 18 years of Netflix coming to me free after buying all this.
[00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:49.000]   So $19, I think that's pretty interesting.
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:50.920]   So you get a $10 Instor credit.
[00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:52.120]   Oh.
[00:48:52.120 --> 00:48:56.120]   $19 plus a credit or $29?
[00:48:56.120 --> 00:48:56.760]   You get-
[00:48:56.760 --> 00:48:57.320]   It's-
[00:48:57.320 --> 00:48:58.840]   No, it's $19.
[00:48:58.840 --> 00:48:59.640]   Hold on.
[00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:03.080]   Google is flashing the price to $29 when you buy Google Store Target,
[00:49:03.080 --> 00:49:03.880]   or Best Buy Edition.
[00:49:03.880 --> 00:49:05.160]   You get a $10 Instor credit.
[00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:05.880]   Oh, so-
[00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:06.280]   In effect-
[00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:07.880]   Your fact is $19, but you're still paying for your $19.
[00:49:07.880 --> 00:49:08.280]   It's an effect, thanks.
[00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:08.680]   Okay.
[00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:09.160]   Well, yeah.
[00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:11.480]   No, I think that's interesting.
[00:49:11.480 --> 00:49:15.720]   The idea is you could talk to your TV now
[00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:17.800]   with an addition of a couple of little devices.
[00:49:17.800 --> 00:49:17.960]   Right.
[00:49:17.960 --> 00:49:18.680]   That's pretty good.
[00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:19.320]   Right.
[00:49:19.320 --> 00:49:20.200]   That is pretty cool.
[00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:20.440]   Yeah.
[00:49:20.440 --> 00:49:23.320]   Ah, I just-
[00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:24.200]   You know, it's like-
[00:49:24.200 --> 00:49:25.960]   Have you found the UK version of these offers?
[00:49:25.960 --> 00:49:26.600]   Because-
[00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:27.800]   You don't get any of this stuff.
[00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:29.480]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:30.920]   We're gonna give you crumpets-
[00:49:30.920 --> 00:49:31.800]   We do it.
[00:49:31.800 --> 00:49:32.120]   Definitely-
[00:49:32.120 --> 00:49:33.400]   It's what we have Thanksgiving.
[00:49:33.400 --> 00:49:34.840]   Well, you know, we're having Thanksgiving.
[00:49:34.840 --> 00:49:37.000]   Because our boys can take that day off easily.
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:37.720]   Oh, nice.
[00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:41.000]   But Black Friday is becoming a thing here,
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:41.880]   which is pretty strange.
[00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:42.680]   Really?
[00:49:42.680 --> 00:49:43.720]   It is here too.
[00:49:43.720 --> 00:49:46.360]   It is here too, even though our Thanksgiving was weeks ago.
[00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:49.960]   Well, it's nothing like singles day in China.
[00:49:49.960 --> 00:49:51.480]   That's for sure.
[00:49:51.480 --> 00:49:51.960]   Whoa!
[00:49:51.960 --> 00:49:52.520]   That's true.
[00:49:52.520 --> 00:49:53.720]   Did we talk about that last week?
[00:49:53.720 --> 00:49:54.200]   I think we did.
[00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:54.520]   Yeah.
[00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:55.240]   Oh, me.
[00:49:55.240 --> 00:49:56.280]   $24 billion.
[00:49:56.280 --> 00:50:00.040]   So, that's their Black Friday in China.
[00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:00.440]   Yeah.
[00:50:00.440 --> 00:50:03.480]   One day sales at Alibaba.
[00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:06.680]   One day for one vendor, one retailer.
[00:50:06.680 --> 00:50:09.640]   $25 billion for one day.
[00:50:09.640 --> 00:50:12.120]   $8 billion in the first hour.
[00:50:12.120 --> 00:50:13.640]   We talked about the holiday though,
[00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:15.080]   like singles day.
[00:50:15.080 --> 00:50:16.520]   I just find that fascinating.
[00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:17.560]   It's 11/11.
[00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:20.280]   We have Valentine's Day.
[00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:21.240]   They have singles day.
[00:50:21.240 --> 00:50:22.760]   It's quite far the biggest holiday.
[00:50:22.760 --> 00:50:23.240]   It's better than to stay.
[00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:24.120]   Okay, that's weird.
[00:50:24.120 --> 00:50:24.520]   Yeah.
[00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:25.320]   Yeah, it's a-
[00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:26.840]   It's Armistice Day.
[00:50:26.840 --> 00:50:28.920]   And it's a singles day because-
[00:50:28.920 --> 00:50:31.480]   I guess it's 11/11 because it's single sticks, right?
[00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:31.560]   Yeah.
[00:50:31.560 --> 00:50:32.760]   11/11.
[00:50:32.760 --> 00:50:34.520]   And it celebrates being single.
[00:50:34.520 --> 00:50:37.480]   This may not wonder if the Chinese government,
[00:50:37.480 --> 00:50:39.320]   when they were trying to control population.
[00:50:39.320 --> 00:50:40.200]   Remember that for a while,
[00:50:40.200 --> 00:50:41.880]   that you couldn't only have one child.
[00:50:41.880 --> 00:50:43.160]   I wonder if the Chinese government
[00:50:43.160 --> 00:50:46.440]   put this out as a way to kind of reduce population.
[00:50:46.440 --> 00:50:47.800]   Don't get married.
[00:50:47.800 --> 00:50:48.520]   Don't have kids.
[00:50:48.520 --> 00:50:51.800]   Just wonder alone in the wilderness forever.
[00:50:51.800 --> 00:50:55.080]   But its order is a magnitude larger than Black Friday.
[00:50:55.080 --> 00:50:57.240]   Black Friday in the US $3 billion.
[00:50:57.240 --> 00:50:59.560]   Cyber Monday in the US $3.4 billion.
[00:51:00.840 --> 00:51:04.760]   Singles Day in China, one retailer, $25 billion.
[00:51:04.760 --> 00:51:09.000]   And it was $5 billion in like 15 minutes.
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:09.720]   Yeah.
[00:51:09.720 --> 00:51:13.960]   I mean, which is interesting
[00:51:13.960 --> 00:51:17.720]   because you don't really think of the Chinese as consumers.
[00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:19.640]   But there is such a growing middle class there.
[00:51:19.640 --> 00:51:21.720]   There is this massive consumer class there.
[00:51:21.720 --> 00:51:23.240]   All of a sudden.
[00:51:23.240 --> 00:51:26.120]   Google Home Max, which is the big version of the mini.
[00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:28.280]   This is the one I'm actually most interested in
[00:51:28.280 --> 00:51:29.800]   because it has a pretty good speaker on it.
[00:51:30.600 --> 00:51:33.240]   It's now getting FCC approval.
[00:51:33.240 --> 00:51:36.440]   It's going to launch along with Apple's HomePod next month.
[00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:39.960]   Now this is interesting.
[00:51:39.960 --> 00:51:44.920]   It has MIMO Wi-Fi.
[00:51:44.920 --> 00:51:49.800]   So multiple input, multiple output,
[00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:52.600]   2.4 and 5 gigahertz Wi-Fi bands.
[00:51:52.600 --> 00:51:57.320]   Maybe this is the speculation at 9 to 5 Google
[00:51:57.320 --> 00:52:00.280]   is so that when you pair units together,
[00:52:00.280 --> 00:52:01.400]   they talk to each other.
[00:52:01.400 --> 00:52:03.080]   That's reasonable.
[00:52:03.080 --> 00:52:03.800]   $3.99.
[00:52:03.800 --> 00:52:04.440]   It's got to be.
[00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:05.560]   Chalk or color.
[00:52:05.560 --> 00:52:08.920]   Is it a good speaker?
[00:52:08.920 --> 00:52:09.480]   I don't know.
[00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:09.880]   Don't know.
[00:52:09.880 --> 00:52:11.320]   Haven't heard it yet.
[00:52:11.320 --> 00:52:15.160]   Everybody's like using that instead of a Sonos.
[00:52:15.160 --> 00:52:16.360]   Well, exactly.
[00:52:16.360 --> 00:52:17.800]   Exactly.
[00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:18.440]   And the HomePods,
[00:52:18.440 --> 00:52:20.440]   everybody who heard the HomePods raved about them
[00:52:20.440 --> 00:52:22.680]   said they were as good as, if not better than the Sonos.
[00:52:22.680 --> 00:52:26.440]   Both of these are Sonos priced $2.99 for the Home Max
[00:52:26.440 --> 00:52:28.120]   and I think $3.99 for the HomePod.
[00:52:28.920 --> 00:52:30.360]   HomePod uses Siri, of course,
[00:52:30.360 --> 00:52:32.920]   how Max uses Google's voice assistant.
[00:52:32.920 --> 00:52:36.920]   It's going to be a great Christmas.
[00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:41.400]   We just got Amazon Echoes in Canada,
[00:52:41.400 --> 00:52:43.480]   and not that anybody cares other than Canadians.
[00:52:43.480 --> 00:52:45.000]   Well, you should care.
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:45.800]   You should care.
[00:52:45.800 --> 00:52:46.360]   Yeah.
[00:52:46.360 --> 00:52:47.240]   Well, it's interesting.
[00:52:47.240 --> 00:52:49.640]   I actually got one when I was at this conference in Munich
[00:52:49.640 --> 00:52:53.240]   and I once I figured out how to stop it from talking German
[00:52:53.240 --> 00:52:56.440]   and start talking English.
[00:52:56.440 --> 00:52:57.160]   What do you say?
[00:52:57.160 --> 00:52:59.160]   Do you use the same trigger words in German?
[00:52:59.160 --> 00:53:03.400]   I don't actually know what the triggers words were.
[00:53:03.400 --> 00:53:04.440]   Adolph!
[00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:05.320]   Adolph!
[00:53:05.320 --> 00:53:06.440]   I went into the setting.
[00:53:06.440 --> 00:53:07.000]   I told him.
[00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:07.560]   I told him.
[00:53:07.560 --> 00:53:07.960]   Adolph!
[00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:08.440]   I told him.
[00:53:08.440 --> 00:53:08.920]   I told him.
[00:53:08.920 --> 00:53:09.400]   It'd be good.
[00:53:09.400 --> 00:53:10.920]   I told him he'd go to the conference.
[00:53:10.920 --> 00:53:12.920]   But I went into the settings and changed it to English.
[00:53:12.920 --> 00:53:14.440]   And I've used it a bit.
[00:53:14.440 --> 00:53:15.480]   I don't know.
[00:53:15.480 --> 00:53:16.040]   I don't know.
[00:53:16.040 --> 00:53:17.560]   I mean, it's handy.
[00:53:17.560 --> 00:53:20.280]   I don't see myself using it to the point
[00:53:20.280 --> 00:53:21.560]   where I need one in every room.
[00:53:21.560 --> 00:53:22.600]   But it's fun to-
[00:53:22.600 --> 00:53:23.960]   Oh, we have one in every room.
[00:53:23.960 --> 00:53:24.680]   We have some other.
[00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:25.560]   We have some other library room.
[00:53:25.560 --> 00:53:28.520]   I have at Google Assistance in two out of the rooms.
[00:53:28.520 --> 00:53:29.320]   That's just ridiculous.
[00:53:29.320 --> 00:53:31.160]   Well, how do you decide whether to use
[00:53:31.160 --> 00:53:32.840]   Amazon Echo or Google Home?
[00:53:32.840 --> 00:53:34.600]   I mean, there are abilities that each-
[00:53:34.600 --> 00:53:37.400]   You know, there is some non-overlap between the two.
[00:53:37.400 --> 00:53:37.880]   Okay.
[00:53:37.880 --> 00:53:42.120]   But truthfully, it's such a pain to think of different assistance
[00:53:42.120 --> 00:53:44.440]   that you just end up picking one and sticking with it.
[00:53:44.440 --> 00:53:47.800]   So, yeah.
[00:53:47.800 --> 00:53:51.160]   I think it should be called the Adolph, the Amazon Adolph.
[00:53:51.160 --> 00:53:53.640]   No?
[00:53:53.640 --> 00:53:55.400]   Ow, Germans would be unhappy with that.
[00:53:55.400 --> 00:53:57.320]   They wouldn't like that.
[00:53:57.320 --> 00:54:00.520]   They don't want to be reminded of their glorious past.
[00:54:00.520 --> 00:54:02.440]   They'd be Ludwig.
[00:54:02.440 --> 00:54:03.000]   Ludwig.
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:04.680]   There you go.
[00:54:04.680 --> 00:54:05.560]   There you go.
[00:54:05.560 --> 00:54:07.160]   Amazon Ludwig.
[00:54:07.160 --> 00:54:12.600]   Well, I mean, is ALEX a reasonable thing in Germany?
[00:54:12.600 --> 00:54:13.000]   I don't know.
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:15.000]   I have a good question.
[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:15.560]   Yeah.
[00:54:15.560 --> 00:54:16.200]   Yeah.
[00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:17.800]   You have to say, Iran has kibok.
[00:54:17.800 --> 00:54:19.240]   Oh, what's the word for-
[00:54:19.240 --> 00:54:21.240]   Lesus Shusrat?
[00:54:21.240 --> 00:54:21.720]   What's it-
[00:54:21.720 --> 00:54:22.520]   It's a life-
[00:54:22.520 --> 00:54:23.560]   Shusrat.
[00:54:23.560 --> 00:54:23.960]   That's it.
[00:54:23.960 --> 00:54:25.160]   That's the trigger word.
[00:54:25.160 --> 00:54:25.480]   Life-
[00:54:25.480 --> 00:54:27.960]   The trigger word is on "life-sung-shus-rat."
[00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:28.440]   Ah.
[00:54:28.440 --> 00:54:29.400]   - Life-sung-shu.
[00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:32.280]   Well, the good news is very unlikely you'd say it by accident.
[00:54:32.280 --> 00:54:33.000]   Oh.
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:35.480]   - And that's true. - And you're never going to hear it on the TV.
[00:54:35.480 --> 00:54:36.920]   No.
[00:54:36.920 --> 00:54:40.440]   My favorite German word is "Finger-spitsen-gifud"
[00:54:40.440 --> 00:54:42.280]   Let's think what that could be.
[00:54:42.280 --> 00:54:45.320]   - "Finger-spitsen-gifud". - "Finger-spitsen-gifud".
[00:54:45.320 --> 00:54:46.680]   "Gifud".
[00:54:46.680 --> 00:54:49.400]   I caught the beginning in the end, but I don't know what the middle is.
[00:54:49.400 --> 00:54:50.360]   - "Finger-spelling".
[00:54:50.360 --> 00:54:50.760]   I don't know.
[00:54:50.760 --> 00:54:51.160]   What is it?
[00:54:51.160 --> 00:54:52.280]   - Think of something the feeling.
[00:54:52.280 --> 00:54:52.920]   - "A-spits".
[00:54:52.920 --> 00:54:58.360]   A-a-the feeling at the tip of your finger.
[00:54:58.360 --> 00:54:59.320]   - "Finger-tip-feel". - Oh, okay.
[00:54:59.320 --> 00:55:00.200]   - Oh, finger.
[00:55:00.200 --> 00:55:03.160]   - Oh, I have a certain feeling, a "Finger-spitsen-gifud".
[00:55:03.160 --> 00:55:04.680]   Interesting.
[00:55:04.680 --> 00:55:06.120]   - How do you say the tip of your tongue?
[00:55:06.120 --> 00:55:08.440]   Or they not do that?
[00:55:08.440 --> 00:55:09.000]   - I don't know.
[00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:11.000]   - You got me?
[00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:13.880]   - We're getting some German fans today, that's for sure.
[00:55:13.880 --> 00:55:14.520]   - Yes, sir.
[00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:16.760]   Now they laugh at us.
[00:55:16.760 --> 00:55:17.560]   - I've run into...
[00:55:17.560 --> 00:55:18.760]   - ...fans and Germany.
[00:55:18.760 --> 00:55:19.320]   - ...jemedy.
[00:55:19.320 --> 00:55:21.880]   - This is pretty much the commonwealth
[00:55:21.880 --> 00:55:24.120]   broadcast. We've got Canada, the UK.
[00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:24.600]   - Exactly.
[00:55:24.600 --> 00:55:25.160]   - ...in the US.
[00:55:25.160 --> 00:55:26.840]   - Well, I'm having this at the moment,
[00:55:26.840 --> 00:55:28.200]   because I've been holed and it's like,
[00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:30.120]   I've just realized the first time for a long time,
[00:55:30.120 --> 00:55:33.640]   I've been sub-warred to speak the language or read the language.
[00:55:33.640 --> 00:55:35.720]   And, you know, it's holding my getaway with everyone's speech.
[00:55:35.720 --> 00:55:38.600]   - Now you know how Donald Trump feels all the time.
[00:55:38.600 --> 00:55:41.080]   - Yes, we have signage things going on in the stuff.
[00:55:41.080 --> 00:55:42.760]   - Yeah, that's for sure.
[00:55:42.760 --> 00:55:46.040]   - Leo, did I ever tell you about coming through the border,
[00:55:46.040 --> 00:55:48.520]   coming back from somewhere in Toronto?
[00:55:48.520 --> 00:55:49.320]   - No.
[00:55:49.320 --> 00:55:50.840]   - And the border guard.
[00:55:50.840 --> 00:55:53.240]   So I go up to him, even though he's Canadian,
[00:55:53.240 --> 00:55:54.520]   he's very frightening looking,
[00:55:54.520 --> 00:55:56.840]   because he has lots of guns and bads.
[00:55:56.840 --> 00:55:58.600]   - People think mouties are cute?
[00:55:58.600 --> 00:56:00.280]   - Microphones. No, this guy has all the...
[00:56:00.280 --> 00:56:01.320]   - Nothing cute about a moutie.
[00:56:01.320 --> 00:56:03.240]   - ...assault weapons and whatnot.
[00:56:03.240 --> 00:56:04.840]   He's not dressed like a friendly moutie.
[00:56:04.840 --> 00:56:05.240]   - No.
[00:56:05.240 --> 00:56:07.480]   - And he says, "Are you Matthew Ingram?"
[00:56:07.480 --> 00:56:09.160]   And I said, "Yes."
[00:56:09.160 --> 00:56:12.200]   And he said it in a way like,
[00:56:12.200 --> 00:56:13.800]   there was something wrong with being that.
[00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:14.200]   - You're in trouble, uh-oh.
[00:56:14.200 --> 00:56:19.000]   - And he said, "Are you on this show, this weekend Google?"
[00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:20.200]   - No, yes!
[00:56:20.200 --> 00:56:21.800]   - And I was like, "Yeah, I'm on there all the time."
[00:56:21.800 --> 00:56:23.080]   He says, "I love that show."
[00:56:23.080 --> 00:56:24.280]   - I watch that show all the time.
[00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:24.840]   - That's fantastic.
[00:56:24.840 --> 00:56:27.880]   Well, I apologize for any smurching of the
[00:56:27.880 --> 00:56:29.960]   fine Canadian border patrol.
[00:56:29.960 --> 00:56:31.000]   - He said he had, he said,
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:32.520]   "I disagree with some of the things
[00:56:32.520 --> 00:56:34.360]   when you're talking about cybersecurity.
[00:56:34.360 --> 00:56:34.840]   - Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:56:34.840 --> 00:56:35.880]   - He said, "I love the truth."
[00:56:35.880 --> 00:56:36.360]   - Yeah.
[00:56:36.360 --> 00:56:36.840]   - So...
[00:56:36.840 --> 00:56:39.720]   - No, we don't expect that people will agree with everything
[00:56:39.720 --> 00:56:41.080]   we say. In fact, it's...
[00:56:41.080 --> 00:56:41.960]   - I told them that.
[00:56:41.960 --> 00:56:43.480]   - ...some of what we say we expect them to get very angry
[00:56:43.480 --> 00:56:44.280]   and upset about.
[00:56:44.280 --> 00:56:47.480]   - Yeah, I should told him he should write in with his views.
[00:56:47.480 --> 00:56:47.960]   - Yeah.
[00:56:47.960 --> 00:56:49.080]   - Yeah.
[00:56:49.080 --> 00:56:51.000]   We don't mind.
[00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:54.040]   Here's a new use for 280 characters on Twitter.
[00:56:54.040 --> 00:56:57.400]   Tetris.
[00:56:57.400 --> 00:56:57.800]   - Faint chess?
[00:56:57.800 --> 00:56:58.040]   - Yeah.
[00:56:58.040 --> 00:56:58.840]   - Oh, Tetris.
[00:56:58.840 --> 00:56:59.800]   - Twitter Tetris.
[00:56:59.800 --> 00:57:00.680]   - Nice.
[00:57:00.680 --> 00:57:01.560]   I haven't seen that.
[00:57:01.560 --> 00:57:03.480]   That's excellent.
[00:57:03.480 --> 00:57:05.080]   It's on GitHub.
[00:57:05.080 --> 00:57:06.360]   - That's some good work.
[00:57:06.360 --> 00:57:07.880]   - You can, it's not fast.
[00:57:07.880 --> 00:57:09.480]   You can do it TWT.
[00:57:09.480 --> 00:57:12.520]   PLAY Tetris.
[00:57:12.520 --> 00:57:17.160]   And so the way it works is you tweet to that account
[00:57:17.160 --> 00:57:19.080]   left, right, rotate, or drop
[00:57:19.080 --> 00:57:21.480]   to vote for the next move.
[00:57:21.480 --> 00:57:23.320]   The votes are tallied every three minutes.
[00:57:23.320 --> 00:57:24.600]   - What?
[00:57:24.600 --> 00:57:27.400]   - This is crowd source Tetris.
[00:57:27.400 --> 00:57:31.160]   - It's the world's slowest game of Tetris.
[00:57:31.160 --> 00:57:32.120]   Well, let's put it this way.
[00:57:32.120 --> 00:57:34.440]   19 hours to clear one line.
[00:57:34.440 --> 00:57:37.240]   - I think we have enough programmers now.
[00:57:37.240 --> 00:57:39.480]   We didn't need any more.
[00:57:39.480 --> 00:57:41.160]   - That's the conclusion that you reach.
[00:57:41.160 --> 00:57:41.720]   - Yeah.
[00:57:41.720 --> 00:57:41.960]   - Yeah.
[00:57:41.960 --> 00:57:43.080]   - What's a Twitch place?
[00:57:43.080 --> 00:57:44.360]   - Twitch place.
[00:57:44.360 --> 00:57:45.000]   - Oh, remember that?
[00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:45.880]   Pokemon, yeah.
[00:57:45.880 --> 00:57:47.240]   - Yeah, that was good.
[00:57:47.240 --> 00:57:48.040]   - That was as fast as it is.
[00:57:48.040 --> 00:57:48.600]   - Wild.
[00:57:48.600 --> 00:57:49.800]   - Fascinating.
[00:57:49.800 --> 00:57:55.240]   - But I think, so I updated no to live to do 280 characters,
[00:57:55.240 --> 00:57:55.560]   Twitter.
[00:57:55.560 --> 00:57:58.200]   And it's messing with my flow.
[00:57:58.200 --> 00:57:59.320]   It's really weird.
[00:57:59.320 --> 00:58:00.840]   So the initial I was the tool I used to do
[00:58:00.840 --> 00:58:02.040]   my live conference, Sweating.
[00:58:02.040 --> 00:58:02.680]   - I don't like it.
[00:58:02.680 --> 00:58:07.080]   - And, you know, part of the challenge of that
[00:58:07.080 --> 00:58:10.280]   was listening to somebody and getting their 140 characters.
[00:58:10.280 --> 00:58:13.080]   And 280, I can get like, they're rambling him.
[00:58:13.080 --> 00:58:14.520]   And it's not good.
[00:58:15.080 --> 00:58:17.560]   - What's the app you use?
[00:58:17.560 --> 00:58:20.200]   - Notalive.com.
[00:58:20.200 --> 00:58:21.400]   - Oh, notalive.
[00:58:21.400 --> 00:58:21.960]   Okay.
[00:58:21.960 --> 00:58:23.800]   - Notalive.com.
[00:58:23.800 --> 00:58:31.000]   - And I like the requirement to trim your thoughts down to
[00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:33.560]   a specific length.
[00:58:33.560 --> 00:58:36.040]   I mean, it imposes a certain discipline.
[00:58:36.040 --> 00:58:40.440]   You know, if, if, if Sonic just be a satellite, it's long,
[00:58:40.440 --> 00:58:42.200]   then they wouldn't be as good.
[00:58:42.200 --> 00:58:44.360]   Not that my tweets are honest.
[00:58:45.320 --> 00:58:46.680]   - But this was, but this was the point.
[00:58:46.680 --> 00:58:50.360]   This was the point I've been doing this at conferences.
[00:58:50.360 --> 00:58:52.360]   Was it maybe listened really closely?
[00:58:52.360 --> 00:58:54.360]   So it had to make them fit in the space.
[00:58:54.360 --> 00:58:57.000]   So I would, because I was taking notes,
[00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:59.000]   but I was also summarizing at the same time,
[00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:01.400]   which meant I was really engaged with the speakers.
[00:59:01.400 --> 00:59:02.680]   And this is my web, so it was,
[00:59:02.680 --> 00:59:05.080]   it's like he must help me to not get into stretch by the internet,
[00:59:05.080 --> 00:59:05.880]   where I'm just.
[00:59:05.880 --> 00:59:07.560]   - And now you can just ramble on and on.
[00:59:07.560 --> 00:59:10.360]   - Now I can just like write down whatever they're going.
[00:59:10.360 --> 00:59:11.560]   It's like, it's not as good.
[00:59:11.560 --> 00:59:13.000]   I don't have to edit as much.
[00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:14.600]   So I may, I'll be turning it back in.
[00:59:14.600 --> 00:59:20.200]   - Can you turn around 280 characters?
[00:59:20.200 --> 00:59:22.280]   - There's a Chrome extension that won't reduce the--
[00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:22.920]   - That's so funny.
[00:59:22.920 --> 00:59:24.120]   - One, four, let us funny.
[00:59:24.120 --> 00:59:25.080]   - That's so funny.
[00:59:25.080 --> 00:59:26.520]   - Well, look, but this is my code.
[00:59:26.520 --> 00:59:30.040]   So I changed 140 to 2D in the code this morning,
[00:59:30.040 --> 00:59:31.400]   because I was doing a conference,
[00:59:31.400 --> 00:59:33.320]   and I couldn't see that others did.
[00:59:33.320 --> 00:59:36.440]   And it didn't feel as, I felt like I missed the constraint,
[00:59:36.440 --> 00:59:37.320]   it was weird.
[00:59:37.320 --> 00:59:37.560]   - Yep.
[00:59:37.560 --> 00:59:41.640]   - It's interesting how fast, though,
[00:59:41.640 --> 00:59:46.600]   all the clients seem to have updated to accommodate 280 characters.
[00:59:46.600 --> 00:59:50.280]   I use Dave Weiner's radio 3.io to--
[00:59:50.280 --> 00:59:52.120]   - Wow.
[00:59:52.120 --> 00:59:52.840]   - Good for you.
[00:59:52.840 --> 00:59:53.560]   - Do you know about it?
[00:59:53.560 --> 00:59:55.720]   - Yeah, I mean, yeah.
[00:59:55.720 --> 00:59:56.680]   I'm a big fan of Dave.
[00:59:56.680 --> 00:59:57.080]   - That's cool.
[00:59:57.080 --> 00:59:58.520]   - I like Dave comes up with them.
[00:59:58.520 --> 00:59:59.480]   - It's kind of old school.
[00:59:59.480 --> 01:00:06.040]   It lets you, so basically, I use this now to tweet the links
[01:00:06.040 --> 01:00:07.960]   that we're going to cover on various shows.
[01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:10.520]   And so it tweets it, it also--
[01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:13.640]   - So he updated a 280 characters like within a day.
[01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:14.040]   - That's cool.
[01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:15.000]   - That's nice.
[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.160]   A lot of the clients have already, I noticed.
[01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:21.880]   - I can't stand the icon for how full you are.
[01:00:21.880 --> 01:00:23.720]   - Oh, I hate that.
[01:00:23.720 --> 01:00:25.320]   - I thought for the first--
[01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:26.280]   - Dave, it does it right.
[01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:29.320]   - I thought it was an actual number that goes down with--
[01:00:29.320 --> 01:00:32.280]   - I thought it was a ticking clock, and the Twitter was slow.
[01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:33.240]   - It's just stupid.
[01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:34.360]   - Do, do, do, do.
[01:00:34.360 --> 01:00:34.760]   - Yeah.
[01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:36.520]   - Over design.
[01:00:36.520 --> 01:00:39.240]   - Speaking of Twitter, I think this is brand new.
[01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:44.440]   Twitter now says that it will pull verification from miscreant users.
[01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:48.040]   - Oh, so they've decided now it's not verification, it's a reward.
[01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:50.840]   - That drives me nuts.
[01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:51.400]   - That drives me nuts.
[01:00:51.400 --> 01:00:53.480]   - This whole thing is a train wreck.
[01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:54.360]   It's a train wreck.
[01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:57.560]   Like, let's face it, verification from the beginning
[01:00:57.560 --> 01:00:59.000]   was a train wreck.
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:00.360]   - It shouldn't be a reward.
[01:01:00.360 --> 01:01:04.040]   It should be a way of saying, if they do it right,
[01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:06.840]   the blue check doesn't mean approval endorsement.
[01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:09.960]   It merely means this person is who he says or she says.
[01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:10.840]   - They are.
[01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:11.720]   - But from the beginning--
[01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:12.280]   - More than 50 seconds.
[01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:15.160]   - From the beginning, they had to have some people and not other people.
[01:01:15.160 --> 01:01:15.800]   - It was a reward.
[01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:19.640]   And now they're now confirmed that it's a reward by saying,
[01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:22.760]   well, you're not going to get to keep it if we don't like you.
[01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:26.680]   I mean, unfortunately, they're lying in the bed they made.
[01:01:26.680 --> 01:01:29.800]   Somebody made the decision in the beginning
[01:01:29.800 --> 01:01:31.880]   that it was going to be totally opaque,
[01:01:31.880 --> 01:01:34.360]   and some people were going to get it and other people weren't.
[01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:35.240]   - Is there an efficient?
[01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:35.720]   - You're right.
[01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:36.040]   - Yeah.
[01:01:36.040 --> 01:01:36.840]   - Right.
[01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:39.960]   But also, they added features.
[01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:43.240]   They basically have a bad model of how their system worked,
[01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:45.800]   which was there were important people and there were plebs.
[01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:47.560]   And the important people get to be verified,
[01:01:47.560 --> 01:01:48.920]   and they get the tools.
[01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:50.200]   And the plebs don't.
[01:01:50.200 --> 01:01:53.560]   And what actually happens onto it is that if you say something interesting,
[01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:55.800]   it takes off, and suddenly you're in--
[01:01:55.800 --> 01:02:01.480]   Sorry, you're in hell because everything is replying to you,
[01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:03.320]   the system is falling apart,
[01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:06.360]   and you don't have the tools that people have that problem,
[01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:07.560]   because you're not verified.
[01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:08.360]   - Yes.
[01:02:08.360 --> 01:02:14.120]   - So, if you have a tweet that gets retweeted a thousand times,
[01:02:14.120 --> 01:02:16.280]   and that auto-verifies you, that would be a good thing.
[01:02:16.280 --> 01:02:19.720]   Or they should separate the two things.
[01:02:19.720 --> 01:02:21.640]   What is like, is this the person--
[01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:22.680]   - Well, they should give you the tool.
[01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:23.640]   Forget about the verification.
[01:02:23.640 --> 01:02:24.200]   - Or is this the parody?
[01:02:24.200 --> 01:02:25.880]   Or should they--
[01:02:25.880 --> 01:02:33.400]   Or can we have tools that restrict my replies in useful ways?
[01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:38.680]   And they've basically failed at that for so many years.
[01:02:38.680 --> 01:02:39.800]   It's not funny.
[01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:44.280]   - Do they still have the tools where I only hear tweets from verified users?
[01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:44.760]   - Yes.
[01:02:44.760 --> 01:02:49.000]   - See, if that meant you're only going to hear tweets from people who have taken the time
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.480]   to verify that they're real, I would do it.
[01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:54.520]   But if it's basically saying only people we've decided to reward.
[01:02:54.520 --> 01:02:55.240]   - We've decided.
[01:02:55.240 --> 01:02:58.120]   - For whatever unknown reasons.
[01:02:58.120 --> 01:03:01.240]   - So, if you know to be fair, or Facebook did the same thing.
[01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:01.640]   - Did they?
[01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:06.520]   - Yeah, so Facebook reached out to me, Jesus, years ago, and said,
[01:03:06.520 --> 01:03:08.440]   "Would you like to be verified?"
[01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:09.960]   I didn't even know they had verification.
[01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:16.360]   - Can't you make a good case that if a guy's in Nazi and tweeting from his account,
[01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:18.120]   that a verification is useful?
[01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:20.360]   Because you know that this is not a spoofed account.
[01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:25.960]   - Well, that was Twitter's argument when they verified whoever it was that people got upset about,
[01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:31.640]   was they were verifying that it was him, the real Nazi, who runs the real Nazi organization.
[01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:35.400]   - Especially now, all times when they have all these spoof accounts,
[01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:37.240]   that we don't know who's real and who's not.
[01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:39.000]   - The problem is they've been trying to do two things.
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:45.480]   One has been your actually who you say you are, and the other is we choose who gets the blue check,
[01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:46.840]   and you don't know why.
[01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:51.080]   And you can't have both, those two things don't work together.
[01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:54.360]   So they've been kind of sucking and now they're trying to blow.
[01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:55.880]   You can't do both of them at the same time.
[01:03:55.880 --> 01:03:58.760]   - Well, I just learned something here today.
[01:03:58.760 --> 01:04:01.000]   You can't suck and blow at the same time.
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000]   - That's a Shakespearean, uh,
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:09.000]   - Wind doth suck, no wind doth blow, not both.
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:13.880]   Let's take a break.
[01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:14.840]   - Can it go since it's awesome?
[01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:15.800]   - Let's take a break. Hold on Kevin.
[01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:17.160]   - On that note.
[01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:18.360]   - Well, hold on.
[01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:19.800]   - Speaking of winds that,
[01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:27.160]   speaking of blow hearts and winds that carry me aloft, I think I shall depart now.
[01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:28.680]   - Is it time for you to depart? Thank you Jim.
[01:04:28.680 --> 01:04:30.600]   - It's time for me to depart. Great to be here.
[01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:33.640]   - I was hoping to have this show over before you had to leave.
[01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:35.960]   But well, Ariana will have what you would say.
[01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:37.080]   You need your sleep.
[01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:39.160]   It was not, I wasn't that late.
[01:04:39.160 --> 01:04:39.800]   Now come on.
[01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:43.400]   It was not a super dope.
[01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:44.680]   - For dosing up just before the show.
[01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:45.080]   - Yes.
[01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:45.720]   Thank you, Jim.
[01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:46.280]   - Oh my God.
[01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:46.840]   - Thank you.
[01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:47.320]   See you next week.
[01:04:47.320 --> 01:04:49.560]   - CUNY, City, University of New York, Buzzmachine.com.
[01:04:49.560 --> 01:04:50.360]   What would Google do?
[01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:52.040]   Public parts have a great, where are you going?
[01:04:52.040 --> 01:04:53.480]   - Where does that is?
[01:04:53.480 --> 01:04:54.440]   - Buenos ed.
[01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:55.000]   - Nice.
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:56.840]   Have a great time in Buenos Aires.
[01:04:56.840 --> 01:04:57.800]   - We'll do for today.
[01:04:57.800 --> 01:05:00.040]   - Eat some meat for me.
[01:05:00.040 --> 01:05:02.680]   Actually, probaleta is my favorite.
[01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:04.760]   Restaurant or food?
[01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:05.160]   - Food.
[01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:08.440]   It's a provolone cheese grilled in a skillet.
[01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:09.000]   - Oh, stop.
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:09.800]   - Probaleta.
[01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:11.400]   - Oh, thank you.
[01:05:11.400 --> 01:05:14.440]   - Oh, it's the queso of Argentina.
[01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:15.960]   - It is the, yes.
[01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:19.080]   The queso funito.
[01:05:19.080 --> 01:05:21.080]   - You have to, you have to re-match
[01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:23.480]   these argytia on two steaks a day, I was going to do.
[01:05:23.480 --> 01:05:27.880]   The beef is very good.
[01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:28.520]   - I like it already.
[01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:30.520]   - Actually, the Italian food's excellent as well.
[01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:31.080]   - Yeah.
[01:05:31.080 --> 01:05:31.560]   - Yeah.
[01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:32.600]   - Have a great time.
[01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:33.160]   - All right, thanks.
[01:05:33.160 --> 01:05:33.640]   - Thanks, Joe.
[01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:34.680]   - I'll see you later.
[01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:38.680]   Our show today brought to you by the ring video doorbell.
[01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:40.360]   If you listen to our shows,
[01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:42.120]   you probably know the sound the ring makes,
[01:05:42.120 --> 01:05:44.360]   because we all have ring doorbells.
[01:05:44.360 --> 01:05:46.920]   And sometimes we forget to mute our phones
[01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:50.360]   and you're doing, you hear the ring doorbell going off.
[01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:52.840]   And it's funny too, because then everybody in the studio
[01:05:52.840 --> 01:05:53.560]   goes, "Is that mine?
[01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:54.040]   Is that mine?"
[01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:56.280]   Ring is awesome.
[01:05:56.280 --> 01:05:58.280]   It's a doorbell that replaces your existing
[01:05:58.280 --> 01:06:00.200]   wired or unwired doorbell,
[01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:01.960]   because they have a, the one ring model
[01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:03.960]   has a big battery in it, your long battery,
[01:06:03.960 --> 01:06:06.040]   that you could put anywhere,
[01:06:06.040 --> 01:06:07.720]   even your bedroom door,
[01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:09.800]   if you want a doorbell on your bedroom door.
[01:06:09.800 --> 01:06:12.520]   But it's not just a doorbell on the ring video.
[01:06:12.520 --> 01:06:14.360]   Doorbell's also a high def camera,
[01:06:14.360 --> 01:06:17.800]   speaker, microphone, and motion sensing.
[01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:19.960]   So it does everything you want.
[01:06:19.960 --> 01:06:22.200]   It's like kind of a guardian at the gates,
[01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:26.120]   watching your door, watching your footpath up to your door,
[01:06:26.120 --> 01:06:27.160]   your front yard,
[01:06:27.960 --> 01:06:29.720]   keeping an eye on motion out there.
[01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:33.240]   If somebody comes to the door or even comes up the steps,
[01:06:33.240 --> 01:06:34.920]   you could say, "Hey, you could talk to them,
[01:06:34.920 --> 01:06:36.120]   you'll get a notification on your phone,
[01:06:36.120 --> 01:06:37.720]   no matter where you are, you don't even have to be at home."
[01:06:37.720 --> 01:06:40.440]   It could be at work, it could be, you know,
[01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:42.440]   having probaletta in Buenos Aires,
[01:06:42.440 --> 01:06:43.720]   you could be doing anything.
[01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:48.440]   And that's a really nice feeling of security.
[01:06:48.440 --> 01:06:49.560]   Never miss a package.
[01:06:49.560 --> 01:06:53.000]   When the delivery service comes to the door,
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:54.840]   you say, "Hey, leave it there, I'll keep an eye on it.
[01:06:54.840 --> 01:06:55.640]   Thanks.
[01:06:55.640 --> 01:06:57.720]   I'm in the bathtub, I'll sign it tomorrow, whatever."
[01:06:58.440 --> 01:07:00.040]   You can keep an eye on your packages too,
[01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:02.040]   which I really like.
[01:07:02.040 --> 01:07:03.800]   Rings expanded the line, of course.
[01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:05.720]   Now they've got the Ring Floodlight Cam.
[01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:08.360]   You've seen these, the action,
[01:07:08.360 --> 01:07:11.480]   the floodlights that turn on on the back of your house
[01:07:11.480 --> 01:07:13.240]   when somebody walks out, you know, just,
[01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:15.880]   those are convenience, but these are them on steroids.
[01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:17.560]   So first of all, they're LED lights,
[01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:19.000]   so they don't burn out their bright,
[01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:21.800]   their consistent light, they come on quick.
[01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:23.160]   You also have the camera,
[01:07:23.160 --> 01:07:25.560]   the motion sensor, the speaker, and the microphone on it,
[01:07:25.560 --> 01:07:27.000]   and an alarm.
[01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:29.960]   So now when somebody is in your backyard,
[01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:32.040]   you'll get a notification, the lights will come on,
[01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:34.520]   you can see who it is, you can talk to them,
[01:07:34.520 --> 01:07:36.120]   you can chase them off,
[01:07:36.120 --> 01:07:37.720]   "Hey, raccoons, get out of there!"
[01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:42.120]   And if they don't move, you can fire off 110 decibel alarm.
[01:07:42.120 --> 01:07:45.160]   It's the ultimate in home security.
[01:07:45.160 --> 01:07:48.040]   High visibility floodlights, a powerful HD camera,
[01:07:48.040 --> 01:07:49.400]   and Wonderwall Street Journal called it
[01:07:49.400 --> 01:07:50.920]   the best of CES this year.
[01:07:50.920 --> 01:07:54.200]   I tell you what, Ring is just doing great things.
[01:07:54.200 --> 01:07:56.120]   All sorts of new things coming from Ring,
[01:07:56.120 --> 01:07:59.640]   but check out the Ring of Security kits we've put together
[01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:01.480]   and save up to $150.
[01:08:01.480 --> 01:08:03.720]   Go to Ring.com/Twig,
[01:08:03.720 --> 01:08:06.760]   choose your Ring doorbell and up to one, two, or three
[01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:09.960]   Ring floodlight cams, save up to $150.
[01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:13.720]   Ring.com/Twig will be a great holiday gift
[01:08:13.720 --> 01:08:16.600]   for family and friends who want security too.
[01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:19.400]   I'm going to set my mom up.
[01:08:19.400 --> 01:08:23.880]   Ring.com/Twig, we thank them so much for their support.
[01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:27.960]   This week in Google, we continue on with Matthew Ingram
[01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:30.200]   from the Columbia Journalism Review, CJR.
[01:08:30.200 --> 01:08:33.320]   It's his new job, first met him, of course, at Gigah Home,
[01:08:33.320 --> 01:08:34.120]   then at Fortune.
[01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:35.480]   Now it's CJR.
[01:08:35.480 --> 01:08:37.080]   It's great to have you back, Matthew.
[01:08:37.080 --> 01:08:41.320]   And from the Netherlands, it's Mr. Kevin Marks,
[01:08:41.320 --> 01:08:43.320]   the king of the indie web at www.indeweb.org.
[01:08:43.320 --> 01:08:47.080]   He's worked everywhere, including Apple, Google,
[01:08:47.080 --> 01:08:50.040]   and BT.
[01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:54.440]   And he's now just promoting the independent web,
[01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:56.360]   and enjoying pub food in Amsterdam.
[01:08:56.360 --> 01:08:58.920]   Actually, the coffee in Amsterdam is superb.
[01:08:58.920 --> 01:09:01.000]   I'm a big Amsterdam coffee fan.
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:04.280]   Oh, the seafood is also very good.
[01:09:04.280 --> 01:09:04.600]   Really?
[01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:06.520]   I didn't have any seafood.
[01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:07.240]   I should.
[01:09:07.240 --> 01:09:09.160]   OK, I have a breastbone for you.
[01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:09.480]   Good.
[01:09:09.480 --> 01:09:11.320]   Good, good, good.
[01:09:11.320 --> 01:09:14.840]   Bloomberg is launching, speaking of Twitter,
[01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:17.560]   a Twitter-based news network in December.
[01:09:17.560 --> 01:09:19.880]   What?
[01:09:19.880 --> 01:09:23.560]   What?
[01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:24.600]   So I guess--
[01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:24.840]   OK.
[01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:28.200]   The project was announced in May.
[01:09:28.200 --> 01:09:29.800]   Goldman Sachs, Infinity TD.
[01:09:29.800 --> 01:09:30.920]   Oh, it's got advertisers.
[01:09:30.920 --> 01:09:34.600]   TD Ameritrade, CA Technologies, AT&T, and CME Group,
[01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:37.400]   each contributing up to $3 million to the partnership.
[01:09:37.400 --> 01:09:39.960]   50 reporters will be dedicated to this site.
[01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:46.040]   It's a Twitter feed?
[01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:49.880]   That's bizarre.
[01:09:49.880 --> 01:09:52.440]   I'm not sure.
[01:09:53.320 --> 01:09:54.600]   It fits Bloomberg.
[01:09:54.600 --> 01:09:57.240]   Bloomberg has been a ticket-taper supplier for ages,
[01:09:57.240 --> 01:10:00.360]   so feeling that it's been mapped to their core competency.
[01:10:00.360 --> 01:10:03.720]   The question is, are you getting trade on it?
[01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:07.320]   Oh, you think it'll be more finance-focused.
[01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:08.120]   That makes sense.
[01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:08.440]   Oh, yeah.
[01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:12.680]   They're the news ticker.
[01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:15.560]   And the news ticker with back up links and analysis.
[01:10:15.560 --> 01:10:16.040]   I guess.
[01:10:16.040 --> 01:10:18.600]   But to be really useful, you would have to have a Twitter account
[01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:19.800]   where you only followed it.
[01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:23.640]   Because otherwise, you're going to have people's sandwiches
[01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:26.440]   and stuff mixed in with your stuff.
[01:10:26.440 --> 01:10:29.320]   Notifications in.
[01:10:29.320 --> 01:10:30.200]   I'm sure you made this work.
[01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:31.640]   Oh, yeah.
[01:10:31.640 --> 01:10:32.520]   Notifications.
[01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:34.200]   Can you do granular notifications and say,
[01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:35.880]   "Just notify me when Bloomberg tweets?"
[01:10:35.880 --> 01:10:38.840]   I don't think so.
[01:10:38.840 --> 01:10:39.480]   Yeah, yes, you can.
[01:10:39.480 --> 01:10:39.880]   Can you?
[01:10:39.880 --> 01:10:41.560]   Pacific account?
[01:10:41.560 --> 01:10:43.400]   That's like the old track feature, which--
[01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:44.360]   It's still there.
[01:10:44.360 --> 01:10:45.080]   No, it's still there.
[01:10:45.080 --> 01:10:46.680]   You have to dig for it, but you can make it
[01:10:46.680 --> 01:10:48.200]   notify you when it's certainly between.
[01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:49.240]   Ah, all right.
[01:10:49.240 --> 01:10:50.840]   And I think Bloomberg's hoping--
[01:10:50.840 --> 01:10:52.920]   I have a tool for this as well, which you can run on Android.
[01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:57.720]   But it's actually in the Twitter app that really buried now.
[01:10:57.720 --> 01:11:02.920]   I think Bloomberg's hoping that you'll leave the player kind of on
[01:11:02.920 --> 01:11:05.640]   in your Twitter or your stream.
[01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:09.400]   And so you'll be reading tweets and it'll be in the background.
[01:11:09.400 --> 01:11:12.760]   Kind of like people keep seeing on in the background.
[01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:15.720]   It's kind of amazing how--
[01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:19.640]   Twitter, people are trying to bend Twitter.
[01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:22.680]   To all sorts of different things.
[01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:25.160]   And yet it seems to bend quite malleable.
[01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:27.400]   Well, Twitter is trying to be bent, right?
[01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:28.760]   They're trying to bend as well.
[01:11:28.760 --> 01:11:30.280]   Right, they want to be bent.
[01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:30.760]   Right.
[01:11:30.760 --> 01:11:35.480]   So that's why they've been approaching live video companies
[01:11:35.480 --> 01:11:36.520]   to do that sort of thing.
[01:11:36.520 --> 01:11:36.920]   Yeah.
[01:11:36.920 --> 01:11:39.480]   Trying to keep people on the platform longer.
[01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:44.040]   Oh, let's see.
[01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:46.360]   Android distribution numbers for November,
[01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:48.440]   almost zero change.
[01:11:49.400 --> 01:11:51.240]   To Oreo, doesn't seem to be--
[01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:53.640]   It's a tiny sliver.
[01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:55.880]   It's been out for three months, Android 8.1.
[01:11:55.880 --> 01:12:01.000]   And the growth in November, 0.3%.
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:04.360]   It was 0.2% in October.
[01:12:04.360 --> 01:12:06.600]   So hey, that's a big jump.
[01:12:06.600 --> 01:12:10.360]   But as you can see from this tiny bar chart,
[01:12:10.360 --> 01:12:16.840]   Oreo still represents a fraction of the overall use of Android.
[01:12:16.840 --> 01:12:18.920]   What's the biggest slice marshmallow?
[01:12:19.640 --> 01:12:20.120]   Yeah.
[01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:23.160]   Then lollipop, then nougat, then KitKat.
[01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:29.080]   But there's still a significant number of gingerbread ice cream sandwich users.
[01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:30.760]   They're still out there.
[01:12:30.760 --> 01:12:31.880]   God.
[01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:37.240]   There's a slice as big as Oreo, actually.
[01:12:37.240 --> 01:12:39.160]   Oreo, in fact, they're bigger.
[01:12:39.160 --> 01:12:41.480]   More people are-- oh, now that's the headline.
[01:12:41.480 --> 01:12:45.560]   More people are using gingerbread, Android 2.3,
[01:12:46.360 --> 01:12:49.480]   then the latest version, Oreo, Android 8.0.
[01:12:49.480 --> 01:12:53.560]   That's depressing.
[01:12:53.560 --> 01:12:56.840]   But there's-- I mean, there's--
[01:12:56.840 --> 01:13:00.040]   they've mitigated that to some extent,
[01:13:00.040 --> 01:13:01.720]   because there's the Badabussy library.
[01:13:01.720 --> 01:13:03.960]   But yeah, it's still depressing.
[01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:07.960]   Well, although it underscores my inclination to say,
[01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:10.440]   if you're going to get an Android phone, get a Pixel phone.
[01:13:10.440 --> 01:13:13.720]   Because you're going to get-- you're always going to be up to date,
[01:13:13.720 --> 01:13:15.320]   and you will get updated automatically.
[01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:17.960]   That's what I like the best about having an Android.
[01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:19.160]   If you have the budget, yeah.
[01:13:19.160 --> 01:13:19.960]   If you have the budget.
[01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:24.200]   Is there a good inexpensive phone that updates regularly?
[01:13:24.200 --> 01:13:26.280]   I guess I'll have to watch all about Android, ask them.
[01:13:26.280 --> 01:13:26.760]   But--
[01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:30.520]   Oneplus was pretty good, but there's some scary--
[01:13:30.520 --> 01:13:31.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:31.880]   --previous, I'm speaking of it.
[01:13:31.880 --> 01:13:32.760]   Let's talk about that.
[01:13:32.760 --> 01:13:33.560]   Yeah.
[01:13:33.560 --> 01:13:34.040]   Yeah.
[01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:34.360]   Yeah.
[01:13:34.360 --> 01:13:42.520]   So oneplus previously was attacked because they had a demon on there
[01:13:42.520 --> 01:13:46.200]   that would launch that would automatically phone home
[01:13:46.200 --> 01:13:47.560]   with information about you.
[01:13:47.560 --> 01:13:50.440]   And they didn't give away to get rid of it.
[01:13:50.440 --> 01:13:55.720]   Now, it looks like they left the back door on their phones.
[01:13:55.720 --> 01:14:00.440]   Engineer mode, it's Qualcomm testing app.
[01:14:00.440 --> 01:14:01.240]   Nice.
[01:14:01.240 --> 01:14:02.360]   Let's you get this.
[01:14:02.360 --> 01:14:05.960]   Get root level access to the phone without unlocking the boot loader.
[01:14:05.960 --> 01:14:07.960]   Now, of course, the bad guy would have to have--
[01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:09.960]   probably have to have physical access to your phone.
[01:14:10.600 --> 01:14:13.880]   But having done so, they could completely own it without you knowing.
[01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:18.520]   Oneplus says they're looking into it.
[01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:23.880]   And they'll probably, I imagine, push a software update that
[01:14:23.880 --> 01:14:25.400]   can turn off engineer mode.
[01:14:25.400 --> 01:14:27.560]   Let's see.
[01:14:27.560 --> 01:14:29.240]   Here's the updates from Engadget.
[01:14:29.240 --> 01:14:32.280]   Oneplus has issued a statement that recaps the nature of engineer mode.
[01:14:32.280 --> 01:14:32.840]   It's threat.
[01:14:32.840 --> 01:14:35.000]   Yes, you do need physical access.
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:38.360]   It's promising to remove it through a future over the year update.
[01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:42.440]   Qualcomm has looked into engineer mode and says,
[01:14:42.440 --> 01:14:44.200]   "Hey, that's not us.
[01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:49.160]   There's some Qualcomm code in there, but somebody else wrote it."
[01:14:49.160 --> 01:14:53.880]   Which kind of makes me think, oneplus took the engineer mode app
[01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:56.600]   and the source code and modified it.
[01:14:56.600 --> 01:15:00.760]   "After in-depth investigation," says Qualcomm,
[01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:04.280]   "We've determined the engineer mode app in question was not authored by Qualcomm.
[01:15:04.280 --> 01:15:07.960]   It no longer resembles the original code we provided.
[01:15:07.960 --> 01:15:11.320]   It was based upon a similarly named testing app that was limited to
[01:15:11.320 --> 01:15:12.680]   displaying device information."
[01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:16.680]   Remember, Oneplus is a Chinese company.
[01:15:16.680 --> 01:15:22.200]   I think these are the kinds of revelations that are damaging to it.
[01:15:22.200 --> 01:15:27.240]   Well, we know that Chinese companies routinely install stuff like that.
[01:15:27.240 --> 01:15:28.920]   That's a known fact.
[01:15:28.920 --> 01:15:32.360]   But it's the classic god mode problem.
[01:15:32.360 --> 01:15:37.000]   I would build a thing that lets me have to be access to everything.
[01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:38.920]   And then you secure it bad.
[01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:42.840]   Or forget to take it off.
[01:15:42.840 --> 01:15:44.040]   Gunhose startups do.
[01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:48.280]   And a big chunk of Chinese built on layers of groundhose startups.
[01:15:48.280 --> 01:15:50.280]   We do that kind of thing at that level.
[01:15:50.280 --> 01:15:54.120]   It's like three levels down from the Uber god mode.
[01:15:54.120 --> 01:15:54.920]   But it's a great thing.
[01:15:54.920 --> 01:15:56.280]   You do need physical access.
[01:15:56.280 --> 01:15:59.000]   I mean, if you have physical access to someone's phone,
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:00.360]   you can do almost anything.
[01:16:00.360 --> 01:16:00.520]   Right.
[01:16:00.520 --> 01:16:01.960]   It's not just one point.
[01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:03.000]   That's a very good point.
[01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.160]   There's nothing to panic about anyway.
[01:16:06.040 --> 01:16:13.160]   The new Oneplus does come out in 16 hours, tomorrow 11am in Brooklyn,
[01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:16.200]   11am Eastern, the OnePlus 5T.
[01:16:16.200 --> 01:16:19.320]   And we're hoping to get a review unit and look at it.
[01:16:19.320 --> 01:16:23.000]   We might be able to see it as soon as Saturday on the new screensavers.
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:23.960]   They're nice phones.
[01:16:23.960 --> 01:16:26.520]   Yeah, I really liked.
[01:16:26.520 --> 01:16:27.960]   I had the first OnePlus.
[01:16:27.960 --> 01:16:30.920]   I think the second OnePlus 2.
[01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:31.800]   I've had a number of them.
[01:16:31.800 --> 01:16:32.840]   And I loved them.
[01:16:32.840 --> 01:16:35.240]   The original OnePlus had amazing battery life.
[01:16:35.240 --> 01:16:36.840]   It was a very good phone for its time.
[01:16:36.840 --> 01:16:39.560]   Cameras were not ever as good as the top of the line Samsung.
[01:16:39.560 --> 01:16:40.120]   No, that's true.
[01:16:40.120 --> 01:16:42.280]   And I don't know.
[01:16:42.280 --> 01:16:43.800]   It depends how you use the phone.
[01:16:43.800 --> 01:16:45.640]   I pay a lot of attention to the camera,
[01:16:45.640 --> 01:16:47.880]   but I notice I don't really use the camera that often.
[01:16:47.880 --> 01:16:51.960]   But when you do, it's really nice to have a decent camera in your pocket.
[01:16:55.640 --> 01:17:03.400]   A new app called Lies by Michael Saiman.
[01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:06.360]   He was 17 years old when he went to work for Facebook.
[01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:10.120]   He'd already launched five apps at the age of 17.
[01:17:10.120 --> 01:17:15.240]   He got a full-time engineering gig as the social networks go to
[01:17:15.240 --> 01:17:16.760]   teen over the past three years.
[01:17:16.760 --> 01:17:21.160]   He helped Facebook try to crack the middle school market with apps
[01:17:21.160 --> 01:17:23.320]   like the now defunct life stage.
[01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:27.480]   This is Josh Konstein writing in TechCrunch in August.
[01:17:27.480 --> 01:17:28.200]   He switched sides.
[01:17:28.200 --> 01:17:29.320]   He went to work for Google.
[01:17:29.320 --> 01:17:31.400]   Michael Saiman's latest.
[01:17:31.400 --> 01:17:32.920]   Now he's 21.
[01:17:32.920 --> 01:17:37.880]   He's a trivia game called Lies, where you try to guess the one true fact
[01:17:37.880 --> 01:17:39.880]   about a friend among a ray of fibs.
[01:17:39.880 --> 01:17:43.160]   So we've seen these games before where you have two lies and a truth
[01:17:43.160 --> 01:17:44.600]   and you have to figure out which one it is.
[01:17:44.600 --> 01:17:47.720]   The slice that's different that makes it interesting is it's about your friends.
[01:17:47.720 --> 01:17:50.440]   I like that.
[01:17:50.440 --> 01:17:56.200]   And apparently you can you need to supply the lies.
[01:17:56.200 --> 01:17:58.920]   In Lies you upload your contacts.
[01:17:58.920 --> 01:18:02.600]   Then you take a Tinder style profile quiz where you swipe yes or no
[01:18:02.600 --> 01:18:03.880]   about questions about yourself.
[01:18:03.880 --> 01:18:07.800]   Then you're given four choice questions about friends
[01:18:07.800 --> 01:18:11.000]   with the goal of correctly guessing which one is true.
[01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:15.400]   I think this is going to do well.
[01:18:15.400 --> 01:18:17.960]   21 years old.
[01:18:17.960 --> 01:18:18.280]   Wow.
[01:18:19.960 --> 01:18:20.840]   Yeah, he's old now.
[01:18:20.840 --> 01:18:22.520]   Yeah, he's old hat.
[01:18:22.520 --> 01:18:23.160]   He's slowing down.
[01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:26.120]   He said it took a whole two weekends to build the app.
[01:18:26.120 --> 01:18:30.760]   I was at this media conference in Munich and there was a kid
[01:18:30.760 --> 01:18:33.960]   involved in the panel that I was on.
[01:18:33.960 --> 01:18:36.760]   It was 14 from Ireland.
[01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:36.760]   Wow.
[01:18:36.760 --> 01:18:43.400]   And he's developed taught himself to code and has developed five or six apps already.
[01:18:43.400 --> 01:18:47.160]   The one he was talking about was I'm trying to remember the name of it,
[01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:50.840]   but it was like a Tinder for media for news.
[01:18:50.840 --> 01:18:56.920]   So you swipe left on stories that you are interested in and it gradually learns
[01:18:56.920 --> 01:18:59.160]   what you're interested in.
[01:18:59.160 --> 01:18:59.800]   Interesting kid.
[01:18:59.800 --> 01:19:02.360]   Well, this is where we're headed.
[01:19:02.360 --> 01:19:06.360]   We had one of America's top young scientists
[01:19:06.360 --> 01:19:10.360]   on the new screensavers on Saturday,
[01:19:10.360 --> 01:19:11.400]   Gutengally Rao.
[01:19:11.400 --> 01:19:13.240]   She's 11 years old.
[01:19:13.240 --> 01:19:14.600]   Wow.
[01:19:14.600 --> 01:19:18.440]   She won the Discovery Education 3M Young Scientist Challenge.
[01:19:18.440 --> 01:19:24.760]   She invented a Arduino based device to test water quality for the residents of Flint, Michigan.
[01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:25.000]   Wow.
[01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:26.200]   Fascinating.
[01:19:26.200 --> 01:19:26.840]   11.
[01:19:26.840 --> 01:19:29.800]   And by the way, watch the interview if you get a chance.
[01:19:29.800 --> 01:19:33.000]   So well spoken.
[01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:33.640]   So smart.
[01:19:33.640 --> 01:19:37.160]   I was stunned.
[01:19:37.160 --> 01:19:39.640]   I was stunned.
[01:19:39.640 --> 01:19:40.840]   The Tangely Rao.
[01:19:40.840 --> 01:19:43.240]   I was reading comic books, I think.
[01:19:43.240 --> 01:19:44.840]   Yeah, comic books, I couldn't read.
[01:19:44.840 --> 01:19:47.640]   I was hit banging rocks together.
[01:19:47.640 --> 01:19:50.840]   Yo-yo's.
[01:19:50.840 --> 01:19:51.880]   I think that was a big deal.
[01:19:51.880 --> 01:19:52.200]   Yo-yo's.
[01:19:52.200 --> 01:19:52.440]   Yeah.
[01:19:52.440 --> 01:19:53.560]   Yo-yo's are really big.
[01:19:53.560 --> 01:19:54.120]   Remember that?
[01:19:54.120 --> 01:19:54.360]   Yeah.
[01:19:54.360 --> 01:19:55.240]   Figured that out.
[01:19:55.240 --> 01:19:56.360]   You'd have because you know why?
[01:19:56.360 --> 01:20:00.040]   Because it was good marketing on the part of who made those yo-yos.
[01:20:00.040 --> 01:20:01.400]   Saying it?
[01:20:01.400 --> 01:20:02.120]   Uh, shh.
[01:20:02.120 --> 01:20:02.600]   Wanna?
[01:20:02.600 --> 01:20:04.200]   Dunkin' Dunkin' Dunkin'.
[01:20:04.200 --> 01:20:07.320]   The Dunkin' Yo-Yo guy would come to your elementary school.
[01:20:07.320 --> 01:20:07.880]   Remember that?
[01:20:07.880 --> 01:20:08.920]   And do all the tricks?
[01:20:08.920 --> 01:20:09.560]   Yeah.
[01:20:09.560 --> 01:20:10.440]   Walk the dog.
[01:20:10.440 --> 01:20:10.840]   Holy big.
[01:20:10.840 --> 01:20:11.720]   Walk the dog.
[01:20:11.720 --> 01:20:13.560]   And I go, I wanna do that.
[01:20:13.560 --> 01:20:14.600]   Well, here we go.
[01:20:14.600 --> 01:20:16.120]   Have some Dunkin' Yo-yos.
[01:20:16.120 --> 01:20:17.880]   Brilliant.
[01:20:17.880 --> 01:20:18.600]   That was my--
[01:20:18.600 --> 01:20:21.960]   So we learned lots of skills when we were that age.
[01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:23.240]   They just weren't very useful.
[01:20:23.240 --> 01:20:25.320]   That's true.
[01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:27.400]   I could solve a Rubik's Cube when I was at that school.
[01:20:27.400 --> 01:20:27.800]   Really?
[01:20:27.800 --> 01:20:28.520]   That's my school.
[01:20:28.520 --> 01:20:29.880]   That's actually impressive.
[01:20:29.880 --> 01:20:31.000]   That's the right timing.
[01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:32.840]   That's really impressive.
[01:20:32.840 --> 01:20:33.880]   Of course, now kids do it.
[01:20:33.880 --> 01:20:35.160]   They're like seeing how fast they do.
[01:20:35.160 --> 01:20:36.200]   And look at you now.
[01:20:36.200 --> 01:20:36.600]   Yeah, right.
[01:20:36.600 --> 01:20:37.640]   Look what happened to you.
[01:20:37.640 --> 01:20:39.240]   You're in a bar in the Netherlands.
[01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:42.200]   Oh, the D-D-D-D.
[01:20:42.200 --> 01:20:43.720]   I'll be Tony to pan the camera.
[01:20:43.720 --> 01:20:44.520]   I see the--
[01:20:44.520 --> 01:20:45.320]   Yeah, everybody wants you.
[01:20:45.320 --> 01:20:48.600]   The chatroom's saying, please show us the rest of the bar.
[01:20:48.600 --> 01:20:48.840]   Do you see--
[01:20:48.840 --> 01:20:49.800]   Leo, did you see--
[01:20:49.800 --> 01:20:50.680]   Here we go.
[01:20:50.680 --> 01:20:52.280]   We're gonna see the beautiful--
[01:20:52.280 --> 01:20:53.880]   Are there any actual Dutch people in there?
[01:20:53.880 --> 01:20:57.480]   Not that many, because they need to just--
[01:20:57.480 --> 01:21:00.520]   Oh, it's right.
[01:21:00.520 --> 01:21:01.000]   No, you're--
[01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:01.480]   Yeah.
[01:21:01.480 --> 01:21:02.520]   It's like the hotel.
[01:21:02.520 --> 01:21:03.640]   It's really not even a bar.
[01:21:03.640 --> 01:21:04.360]   It's just like a--
[01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:04.600]   Oh, okay.
[01:21:04.600 --> 01:21:05.720]   It's quite large.
[01:21:05.720 --> 01:21:06.280]   It's hotel.
[01:21:06.280 --> 01:21:06.920]   Yeah.
[01:21:06.920 --> 01:21:07.720]   It's the--
[01:21:07.720 --> 01:21:09.560]   It's a conference hotel.
[01:21:09.560 --> 01:21:10.600]   It's like--
[01:21:10.600 --> 01:21:11.240]   Right.
[01:21:11.240 --> 01:21:12.200]   Dutch design hotel.
[01:21:12.200 --> 01:21:13.320]   Yeah.
[01:21:13.320 --> 01:21:15.640]   So it's very clean, in other words.
[01:21:15.640 --> 01:21:20.520]   Uh, let's see.
[01:21:20.520 --> 01:21:21.560]   What else here?
[01:21:21.560 --> 01:21:23.240]   Volvo's parent company.
[01:21:23.240 --> 01:21:23.640]   Oh, go ahead.
[01:21:23.640 --> 01:21:24.440]   I'm sorry, Matthew.
[01:21:24.440 --> 01:21:26.360]   I just wondered if you saw--
[01:21:26.360 --> 01:21:28.440]   I didn't see this in the lineup.
[01:21:28.440 --> 01:21:32.920]   Did you see that Amazon did a test of its cashierless store?
[01:21:32.920 --> 01:21:36.120]   I think Bloomberg wrote about it.
[01:21:36.120 --> 01:21:39.240]   They were testing the facial recognition.
[01:21:39.240 --> 01:21:42.600]   So obviously, the store recognizes you when you buy things,
[01:21:42.600 --> 01:21:44.600]   or when you take things off the shelf,
[01:21:44.600 --> 01:21:47.080]   and then it builds your account automatically.
[01:21:47.080 --> 01:21:49.640]   So obviously, it has to recognize who you are.
[01:21:49.640 --> 01:21:54.040]   So a bunch of employees dressed up as Pikachu.
[01:21:54.040 --> 01:21:57.560]   So they bright yellow Pikachu costume.
[01:21:57.560 --> 01:21:58.120]   And you know what?
[01:21:58.120 --> 01:21:59.000]   To see whether they--
[01:21:59.000 --> 01:21:59.800]   They got caught.
[01:21:59.800 --> 01:22:02.440]   And it had no problem.
[01:22:02.440 --> 01:22:04.760]   No, the Pikachu didn't fool it.
[01:22:04.760 --> 01:22:06.920]   That sounds a little bit like a--
[01:22:06.920 --> 01:22:08.040]   So forget about that.
[01:22:08.040 --> 01:22:09.320]   A staged--
[01:22:09.320 --> 01:22:11.080]   Maybe a little bit of a staged publicity--
[01:22:11.080 --> 01:22:11.880]   Maybe a little.
[01:22:11.880 --> 01:22:14.280]   These are called the Amazon Go stores.
[01:22:14.280 --> 01:22:15.000]   And they've been--
[01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:16.040]   They've had one in Seattle.
[01:22:16.040 --> 01:22:16.280]   I haven't--
[01:22:16.280 --> 01:22:17.720]   Have you ever-- anybody ever been to one?
[01:22:17.720 --> 01:22:18.680]   No.
[01:22:18.680 --> 01:22:22.280]   So you walk in, it knows who you are.
[01:22:22.280 --> 01:22:23.800]   You pick up what you want, and you leave.
[01:22:23.800 --> 01:22:24.280]   That's it.
[01:22:24.280 --> 01:22:29.160]   Uh, I don't know if you have to check in with a mobile app or something.
[01:22:29.160 --> 01:22:30.840]   Now--
[01:22:30.840 --> 01:22:33.240]   I think you have to be logged in somehow.
[01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:35.240]   Yeah.
[01:22:35.240 --> 01:22:37.640]   But I mean, I'm always logged in on my Amazon app,
[01:22:37.640 --> 01:22:38.200]   aren't I? I mean--
[01:22:38.200 --> 01:22:39.480]   Yeah.
[01:22:39.480 --> 01:22:41.160]   And it's probably beakening all the time,
[01:22:41.160 --> 01:22:42.760]   as I wander around.
[01:22:42.760 --> 01:22:44.200]   Who God only knows what it's
[01:22:44.200 --> 01:22:45.640]   sending back to the home office.
[01:22:45.640 --> 01:22:49.240]   Jeff knows where you are at all times.
[01:22:49.240 --> 01:22:49.560]   Yeah.
[01:22:49.560 --> 01:22:51.080]   Of course he does.
[01:22:51.080 --> 01:22:52.360]   Bazos, not Jarvis.
[01:22:52.360 --> 01:22:55.160]   So I thought it was just a test.
[01:22:55.160 --> 01:22:58.360]   So it sounds like they're actually planning to--
[01:22:58.360 --> 01:22:59.480]   Yeah, they're close to rolling out.
[01:22:59.480 --> 01:23:02.360]   They're starting to hire actual retail employees,
[01:23:02.360 --> 01:23:03.240]   not just end-use.
[01:23:03.240 --> 01:23:05.400]   So if you work in Whole Foods right now,
[01:23:05.400 --> 01:23:06.600]   you got to be terrified.
[01:23:07.240 --> 01:23:09.000]   Well, we talked about this before.
[01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:10.520]   There's a whole generation of,
[01:23:10.520 --> 01:23:14.760]   you know, sort of early entry jobs,
[01:23:14.760 --> 01:23:16.440]   like cashier type jobs.
[01:23:16.440 --> 01:23:18.200]   They're just going to go away eventually.
[01:23:18.200 --> 01:23:24.040]   This Bloomberg story does point out that a Whole Foods store,
[01:23:24.040 --> 01:23:24.760]   which is much--
[01:23:24.760 --> 01:23:27.480]   is like eight hundred square feet with a lot more items,
[01:23:27.480 --> 01:23:30.520]   would be a little bit harder to make work.
[01:23:30.520 --> 01:23:31.080]   Right now.
[01:23:31.080 --> 01:23:32.280]   Right now.
[01:23:32.280 --> 01:23:33.480]   Yeah.
[01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:37.000]   Oh no, actually Whole Foods are bigger.
[01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:37.800]   The store--
[01:23:37.800 --> 01:23:39.560]   the ghost store is eighteen hundred square feet.
[01:23:39.560 --> 01:23:41.640]   But the Whole Foods--
[01:23:41.640 --> 01:23:42.200]   Oh, this is huge.
[01:23:42.200 --> 01:23:43.400]   Yeah, much bigger than that.
[01:23:43.400 --> 01:23:44.120]   Oh yeah, they're like,
[01:23:44.120 --> 01:23:45.160]   well, that's always--
[01:23:45.160 --> 01:23:46.360]   Most of them are very, very big.
[01:23:46.360 --> 01:23:47.240]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:23:47.240 --> 01:23:48.200]   An eighteen hundred square foot,
[01:23:48.200 --> 01:23:49.400]   all foods would be tiny.
[01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:52.280]   Okay, let me correct myself on that.
[01:23:52.280 --> 01:23:53.800]   You ready for self-driving trucks?
[01:23:53.800 --> 01:23:55.160]   Because everybody's doing them.
[01:23:55.160 --> 01:23:58.840]   Elon Musk, I think is it today or tomorrow?
[01:23:58.840 --> 01:24:00.120]   Is it going to show off theirs?
[01:24:00.120 --> 01:24:01.000]   Yep.
[01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:02.440]   The Tesla.
[01:24:03.560 --> 01:24:08.440]   And apparently, there are already
[01:24:08.440 --> 01:24:10.680]   robo trucks delivering refrigerators.
[01:24:10.680 --> 01:24:14.680]   We've got to move these microwave ovens.
[01:24:14.680 --> 01:24:16.680]   Nice, you know, money for nothing.
[01:24:16.680 --> 01:24:17.880]   And my truck for free.
[01:24:17.880 --> 01:24:21.080]   The startup Embark has been hauling frigidaires
[01:24:21.080 --> 01:24:26.120]   up the I-10 from El Paso to Palm Springs.
[01:24:26.120 --> 01:24:30.600]   There is a human rider in the cab to monitor,
[01:24:30.600 --> 01:24:33.000]   but the ultimate goal is to get rid of the human.
[01:24:33.640 --> 01:24:35.800]   So this has been going on all this time,
[01:24:35.800 --> 01:24:36.600]   no, but even never.
[01:24:36.600 --> 01:24:40.920]   I just want to grab a clip of you saying,
[01:24:40.920 --> 01:24:43.160]   the ultimate goal is to get rid of the human.
[01:24:43.160 --> 01:24:49.240]   The ultimate goal is to get rid of the human.
[01:24:49.240 --> 01:24:52.120]   Well, actually, it would probably say it exactly as I did,
[01:24:52.120 --> 01:24:53.000]   right in a natural--
[01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:53.560]   It would.
[01:24:53.560 --> 01:24:54.520]   Sounding almost--
[01:24:54.520 --> 01:24:54.520]   They're almost--
[01:24:54.520 --> 01:24:55.560]   They're almost as big as that part now.
[01:24:55.560 --> 01:24:57.320]   Almost human voice, that part's easy.
[01:24:57.320 --> 01:24:58.840]   Humans are inefficiently.
[01:24:58.840 --> 01:25:02.600]   Our goal is to get rid of the human.
[01:25:03.400 --> 01:25:04.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:25:04.600 --> 01:25:09.320]   Well, we'll look forward to finding new work.
[01:25:09.320 --> 01:25:14.360]   Volvo is just a parent company, just bought a flying car startup.
[01:25:14.360 --> 01:25:16.120]   Now, if you have--
[01:25:16.120 --> 01:25:17.400]   Yeah, Tesla's working on one too.
[01:25:17.400 --> 01:25:19.000]   Yeah, but these have to be autonomous.
[01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.960]   There's no way I'm going to trust a human pilot a flying car.
[01:25:21.960 --> 01:25:25.160]   The lines in the road are anything.
[01:25:25.160 --> 01:25:27.160]   And they have to have inter-vehicle communication,
[01:25:27.160 --> 01:25:28.360]   and they have to, you know, I mean--
[01:25:30.600 --> 01:25:34.760]   Tesla's talking about a sort of vertical take-off and landing
[01:25:34.760 --> 01:25:41.640]   kind of vehicle that would sort of pick you up and deposit you on rooftops and whatnot.
[01:25:41.640 --> 01:25:41.880]   Yeah.
[01:25:41.880 --> 01:25:48.120]   This is Terra Fuji's TFX.
[01:25:48.120 --> 01:25:49.480]   It actually looks really cool.
[01:25:49.480 --> 01:25:52.520]   So it looks like--
[01:25:52.520 --> 01:25:54.840]   I think Boeing was working on one too, weren't they?
[01:25:54.840 --> 01:25:57.960]   Boeing or one of the plane companies?
[01:25:57.960 --> 01:26:03.320]   So this is a VTOL or a vertical take-off and landing vehicle.
[01:26:03.320 --> 01:26:05.880]   It looks just like a car, but it's got helicopter--
[01:26:05.880 --> 01:26:10.440]   dual helicopter rotors on it, which I think they would tilt, right?
[01:26:10.440 --> 01:26:11.240]   So--
[01:26:11.240 --> 01:26:11.560]   Yeah.
[01:26:11.560 --> 01:26:12.680]   Wow.
[01:26:12.680 --> 01:26:15.160]   Electric powered.
[01:26:15.160 --> 01:26:18.680]   And I have to think-- I have to-- I pray, autonomous.
[01:26:18.680 --> 01:26:23.000]   Because otherwise, it's just not going to work.
[01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:26.440]   But I'm sure, like, just as with trucks, I'm sure there's going to--
[01:26:26.440 --> 01:26:29.480]   or cabs, I think there's going to be a human being in there
[01:26:29.480 --> 01:26:32.040]   for at least a few years just to sit there--
[01:26:32.040 --> 01:26:32.280]   Yeah.
[01:26:32.280 --> 01:26:34.120]   --to make people feel comfortable.
[01:26:34.120 --> 01:26:34.360]   Yeah.
[01:26:34.360 --> 01:26:37.240]   Encryption's in the news again.
[01:26:37.240 --> 01:26:41.080]   Of course, after-- you know, I think it's now weekly.
[01:26:41.080 --> 01:26:44.520]   We're going to have mass shootings in the United States.
[01:26:44.520 --> 01:26:48.200]   Do people in Canada and the UK just shake their head?
[01:26:48.200 --> 01:26:49.320]   Are they baffled? Are they--
[01:26:49.320 --> 01:26:50.680]   What are they--
[01:26:50.680 --> 01:26:50.760]   Yes.
[01:26:50.760 --> 01:26:52.760]   Yes.
[01:26:52.760 --> 01:26:53.640]   Of course--
[01:26:53.640 --> 01:26:54.440]   I mean--
[01:26:54.440 --> 01:26:55.320]   This is what's interesting.
[01:26:55.320 --> 01:26:58.520]   We had one yesterday in Northern California
[01:26:58.520 --> 01:27:02.040]   that barely made the news because he only killed five people.
[01:27:02.040 --> 01:27:04.760]   Barely made the news.
[01:27:04.760 --> 01:27:07.000]   Yeah, that was only because of lockdown.
[01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.160]   Yeah. And he was trying to get into a school
[01:27:09.160 --> 01:27:12.120]   and thank God the administrators were gunshots
[01:27:12.120 --> 01:27:14.280]   ran to the doors and locked them and he didn't get in
[01:27:14.280 --> 01:27:18.040]   because it could have been worse than anything.
[01:27:18.040 --> 01:27:18.520]   Yeah.
[01:27:18.520 --> 01:27:20.600]   Uh, an elementary school.
[01:27:20.600 --> 01:27:25.000]   And it-- but what's interesting is it's so commonplace now in the US.
[01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:26.440]   It wasn't even that big a story.
[01:27:26.440 --> 01:27:29.720]   Well, and there's been half a dozen since Las Vegas,
[01:27:29.720 --> 01:27:31.320]   which wasn't that long ago.
[01:27:31.320 --> 01:27:35.560]   It just-- just when you think, well, this is the worst.
[01:27:35.560 --> 01:27:37.480]   You know, it just keeps coming.
[01:27:37.480 --> 01:27:39.000]   They just keep happening.
[01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:40.360]   Ah, it's so sad.
[01:27:40.360 --> 01:27:45.640]   And of course, in every case, the shooter will have a smartphone.
[01:27:45.640 --> 01:27:49.320]   And in every case, the Department of Justice will want to get in
[01:27:49.320 --> 01:27:52.040]   and in most cases, it will be encrypted and locked.
[01:27:53.080 --> 01:27:57.640]   So it's ancient history now, but the Texas shooting of a couple of weeks ago,
[01:27:57.640 --> 01:27:59.480]   there is an iPhone.
[01:27:59.480 --> 01:28:04.920]   And, you know, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said,
[01:28:04.920 --> 01:28:08.520]   "When you shoot dozens of innocent American citizens,
[01:28:08.520 --> 01:28:11.960]   we want law enforcement to investigate your communications and store data.
[01:28:11.960 --> 01:28:13.960]   There are things you need to know."
[01:28:13.960 --> 01:28:17.880]   He said, "As a matter of fact, this might you might want to argue with,
[01:28:17.880 --> 01:28:22.040]   no reasonable person questions are right to access the phone."
[01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:26.840]   But the company that built it, and I think we know now it's Apple,
[01:28:26.840 --> 01:28:31.480]   claims that it purposely designed the operating system so the company cannot open the phone,
[01:28:31.480 --> 01:28:33.320]   even with the order from a federal judge.
[01:28:33.320 --> 01:28:36.760]   In addition to costing a great deal of time and money,
[01:28:36.760 --> 01:28:39.560]   this is surely going to cost lives.
[01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:49.720]   I mean, of course, I-- you know, if you-- in a vacuum, you would say,
[01:28:49.720 --> 01:28:52.920]   "Well, yeah, law enforcement should be able to get into that phone."
[01:28:52.920 --> 01:28:58.440]   In a vacuum, the problem is if-- now, this is an interesting thing that Steve Gibson said
[01:28:58.440 --> 01:29:01.480]   yesterday on security now that might change the conversation.
[01:29:01.480 --> 01:29:04.040]   What we've always said is, "Well, if there's a backdoor,
[01:29:04.040 --> 01:29:09.240]   if there's a key to get into it, then what's to stop China or Russia or
[01:29:09.240 --> 01:29:12.280]   any other country from saying to Apple?"
[01:29:12.280 --> 01:29:14.280]   Okay, well, we want to get in these phones too.
[01:29:14.280 --> 01:29:16.360]   So that's problem number one.
[01:29:16.360 --> 01:29:19.000]   It's not just the Department of Justice in the United States
[01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:20.120]   that would then have access.
[01:29:20.120 --> 01:29:24.520]   There's also the larger issue of if you do have a backdoor,
[01:29:24.520 --> 01:29:31.000]   how-- you know, we've seen the NSA, the CIA, and the FBI all be hacked and exploits escape.
[01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.960]   How long can you keep that a secret?
[01:29:33.960 --> 01:29:36.040]   But Steve Gibson said an interesting thing.
[01:29:36.040 --> 01:29:40.760]   He said he believes-- and I don't know if anybody else has said this or if it's confirmed--
[01:29:40.760 --> 01:29:45.640]   that it is possible for Apple to unlock just one phone without providing the means to unlock
[01:29:45.640 --> 01:29:53.080]   any other phone, that every phone has a dedicated encryption key that could be exfiltrated by the
[01:29:53.080 --> 01:29:57.240]   company. That would be interesting if that's the case.
[01:29:57.240 --> 01:30:01.480]   Really? Because I thought the argument was that you couldn't do that.
[01:30:01.480 --> 01:30:05.640]   And so that by providing it for one phone, they would effectively just give everybody a key.
[01:30:05.640 --> 01:30:11.560]   It doesn't obviate the first argument, which is, well, if you let it be known that you can do that,
[01:30:11.560 --> 01:30:17.640]   here comes China. But it does kind of soften the second argument. It doesn't, in fact,
[01:30:17.640 --> 01:30:23.080]   make all of our phones more at risk. So I have never heard anybody else say this.
[01:30:23.080 --> 01:30:29.080]   And I don't know if this is the case, but Steve says it's his understanding and belief that it is
[01:30:29.080 --> 01:30:33.720]   possible to unlock any individual iPhone. Apple could do that.
[01:30:33.720 --> 01:30:36.840]   Steve has forgotten more about this than I will ever know.
[01:30:36.840 --> 01:30:40.680]   I would certainly take his word for it.
[01:30:40.680 --> 01:30:42.280]   Yeah. I mean, they don't have the means today.
[01:30:42.280 --> 01:30:46.760]   But they could. They could have the means. And they could actually say,
[01:30:46.760 --> 01:30:53.080]   I think this is what he's implying, they could push out an update to any phone that would make
[01:30:53.080 --> 01:30:59.480]   that possible in the exfiltrated. And it's possible that Apple doesn't want to admit that they can
[01:30:59.480 --> 01:31:05.400]   do that because they would much rather not. So if you say we can't do it without providing it
[01:31:05.400 --> 01:31:11.720]   for every phone, then you. So you could do a selective operating system update in effect that
[01:31:11.720 --> 01:31:17.880]   is dedicated just to that phone. I'm sure Apple wouldn't want to push a system wide operating
[01:31:17.880 --> 01:31:23.800]   system update that would make that possible because they don't want to get subpoenas from other
[01:31:23.800 --> 01:31:29.400]   places. That's the thing, once you make it obvious that you can,
[01:31:30.520 --> 01:31:36.360]   then everyone is going to start asking you to do it. So that I would understand. But one of the
[01:31:36.360 --> 01:31:41.880]   arguments we always give is, well, that's going to make all of our phones more vulnerable to bad
[01:31:41.880 --> 01:31:50.040]   guys. And I don't know if that's the case. So I need to get a folder conversation with Steve
[01:31:50.040 --> 01:31:54.760]   about that. And maybe he can give me some links, something to be aware of anyway.
[01:31:58.120 --> 01:32:04.760]   Of course, and we talked about this a little bit yesterday too, your antivirus could be the
[01:32:04.760 --> 01:32:11.560]   biggest hole in a computer system. There's a new flaw called AV Gator. Gator not as an alligator,
[01:32:11.560 --> 01:32:17.880]   but Gator as an opening a gate that takes advantage of your antivirus and many are susceptible to this
[01:32:17.880 --> 01:32:26.760]   to get root access to the operating system. Oh boy. And actually, antivirus, like hackers have
[01:32:26.760 --> 01:32:32.440]   talked for a long time about how antivirus is one of the best roots because it gets
[01:32:32.440 --> 01:32:37.640]   root access to your system. That's how it protects you from viruses. So it's the best possible
[01:32:37.640 --> 01:32:43.720]   introduction, medium for a virus. And speaking of hacking, this one really scared me. The
[01:32:43.720 --> 01:32:53.080]   Department of Homeland Security was able to hack the new Boeing 757 within 48 hours with a remote,
[01:32:53.800 --> 01:33:00.600]   non cooperative penetration. Nice. Yeah. I'll avoid the Harvey Weinstein.
[01:33:00.600 --> 01:33:04.040]   That's some good work. Yes. Thank you for not doing that.
[01:33:04.040 --> 01:33:09.240]   Yes. Thank you. You didn't have to have anybody touch the airplane.
[01:33:09.240 --> 01:33:14.040]   Wow. You've did it through RF.
[01:33:14.040 --> 01:33:19.800]   Really? Actually, this is not a new, oh, sorry. This is not a new plane. This is a
[01:33:20.680 --> 01:33:28.120]   older Boeing 757 commercial plane purchased by the DHS for this testing.
[01:33:28.120 --> 01:33:33.320]   And the response from experts was, oh, we've known about that for years.
[01:33:33.320 --> 01:33:44.200]   That's reassuring. But in 20 in March of this year, at a technical exchange meeting,
[01:33:44.200 --> 01:33:51.240]   the DHS told seven airline pilot captains from America and Delta about it. The quote is,
[01:33:51.240 --> 01:33:55.320]   all seven of them broke their jaw hitting the table when they said, you guys have known about
[01:33:55.320 --> 01:33:59.720]   this for years and haven't bothered to let us know because we depend on this stuff to be absolutely
[01:33:59.720 --> 01:34:05.800]   the Bible. Wow. Seems like the kind of thing you might want to mention.
[01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:17.240]   Yeah. Oh, wow. So let's see. This is Robert Hickey, aviation program manager within the
[01:34:17.240 --> 01:34:23.160]   cyber security division of the Department of Homeland Security Science and Technology Directorate.
[01:34:23.160 --> 01:34:28.520]   I'm glad we have a science and technology directorate. Sounds a little cough gask, but I'm glad we have it.
[01:34:28.520 --> 01:34:34.040]   He says, I didn't have anybody touching the airplane. I didn't have an insider threat. I
[01:34:34.040 --> 01:34:37.960]   stood off using the typical stuff that could get through security. We were able to establish a
[01:34:37.960 --> 01:34:47.400]   presence on the systems of that aircraft using RF. And I guess they were what they were able to
[01:34:47.400 --> 01:34:53.800]   modify the avionics. They were, I don't know what exactly they did. They don't say maybe they
[01:34:53.800 --> 01:34:59.240]   don't want to say what they could do. They probably shouldn't go into too much detail.
[01:34:59.240 --> 01:35:04.200]   Yeah. The airline say it's too expensive to fix.
[01:35:04.200 --> 01:35:12.120]   The cost of even more reassured. Yeah, the cost of changing one line of code on a piece of avionics
[01:35:12.120 --> 01:35:19.000]   equipment is $1 million and takes a year to implement. Wow. I guess you've got to do it right the first time.
[01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:22.840]   Wow.
[01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:30.040]   Okay. Just, you know, now you know, so now you know the rest of the story.
[01:35:30.040 --> 01:35:37.480]   Senators are now pushing for I'm curious what you guys think of this. Dumping social security
[01:35:37.480 --> 01:35:44.680]   numbers for identification ever since the Equifax hack. The Senate Commerce Committee
[01:35:44.680 --> 01:35:51.880]   had testimony from Marissa Meyer. If Verizon's privacy officer Karen Zachari,
[01:35:52.840 --> 01:35:59.480]   they're both the current and former CEOs of Equifax. I think Brishnier, this is one Brishnier testified
[01:35:59.480 --> 01:36:08.200]   at as well. They brought up the Brazilian system, which is a system of citizen IDs through public
[01:36:08.200 --> 01:36:13.400]   key crypto digital certificates. Certificate lasts no more than three years at most.
[01:36:13.400 --> 01:36:19.880]   It can be used to issue a digital signature, much like a written signature. And very importantly,
[01:36:19.880 --> 01:36:24.680]   unlike social security numbers or fingerprints, it can be the identity accounts can be revoked
[01:36:24.680 --> 01:36:29.400]   and reissued as easily through a national established protocol. I should ask Jeff to check this out
[01:36:29.400 --> 01:36:35.400]   when he was on his way to Buenos Aires. The problem is that as soon as you do that in the United
[01:36:35.400 --> 01:36:39.960]   States, and I don't know if this is an issue in other countries, people scream and horror,
[01:36:39.960 --> 01:36:48.040]   national identity card, and the conversation immediately ends. It is a hot topic, a hot button
[01:36:48.040 --> 01:36:50.680]   in the US Congress. You can't have a national ID card.
[01:36:50.680 --> 01:36:56.760]   Nothing to say. Okay.
[01:36:56.760 --> 01:37:05.480]   It's like we have them that they're made of paper and they have a seven digit number on.
[01:37:05.480 --> 01:37:07.160]   Right. Right.
[01:37:07.160 --> 01:37:11.000]   My first US bank account, that was required to be my login.
[01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:15.160]   Isn't that terrible? They use your social for a login.
[01:37:15.880 --> 01:37:21.080]   Social was your login and the password had to be a four to six digit.
[01:37:21.080 --> 01:37:31.800]   And they had and they stored it in phone typing numbers. So they'd actually reduce the
[01:37:31.800 --> 01:37:40.360]   the actual variation down to 10 digits. Yeah. Unbelievable. Just now, I guess Google doesn't own
[01:37:40.360 --> 01:37:48.440]   Boston dynamics anymore. They sold them. Yeah. Thank God. Boston Dynamics has made, they say,
[01:37:48.440 --> 01:37:53.960]   a new, a new robot dog that's kid friendly. Well, at least the color is a kid friendly yellow,
[01:37:53.960 --> 01:37:59.800]   but I'm going to show you the video of spot mini. And you tell me, is this kid friendly? Here
[01:37:59.800 --> 01:38:06.680]   comes spot mini. I should turn on the sound for this. Ah, ah.
[01:38:07.320 --> 01:38:16.280]   It's a demo dog. It's terrifying. Let's do it again one more time.
[01:38:16.280 --> 01:38:23.000]   Just in case you weren't getting nightmares. Here comes the dog. It looks at you with its
[01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:31.320]   weird eyes and then starts off. Yeah, that's kid friendly. Sure. What kid wouldn't want one? Oh, yes.
[01:38:33.400 --> 01:38:38.920]   And I think we are.
[01:38:38.920 --> 01:38:39.160]   I bow.
[01:38:39.160 --> 01:38:48.200]   I think it's back. I bow. They are Sony is. Yeah, that's right. They are bringing it back. Yeah.
[01:38:48.200 --> 01:38:54.200]   Why? Because sad. Why not? If there's a fake dog.
[01:38:55.800 --> 01:39:03.560]   Okay. So it can date Sony says it will form an emotional bond with members of the household
[01:39:03.560 --> 01:39:08.840]   providing them with love, affection, and the joy of nurturing and raising a companion.
[01:39:08.840 --> 01:39:18.600]   It uses it. Oh, Jesus Christ. It's got a rubber tail. Yeah. That is nice. That is also,
[01:39:18.600 --> 01:39:24.680]   I'm sorry. I know it's small, but oh, just get a real dog.
[01:39:24.680 --> 01:39:29.480]   Doesn't that make you want one? Just get a real freaking dog. I have four real dogs. I didn't
[01:39:29.480 --> 01:39:36.280]   know. Oh, you can do a high five with it. It's body can move along 22 axes. Its eyes use two OLED
[01:39:36.280 --> 01:39:41.880]   panels to show a range of expressions battery life two hours. So you can play with it, but it's
[01:39:41.880 --> 01:39:50.840]   going to be sleeping pretty quick. Three hour recharge time. Wow. How much do you think?
[01:39:50.840 --> 01:39:56.760]   2000. That's what the old one was. I think it should be like the Tamagotchies. Do you remember
[01:39:56.760 --> 01:40:00.440]   those? Or if you didn't take care of them, they would die. I love them. Yeah. That would be a
[01:40:00.440 --> 01:40:05.560]   useful lesson. You also have to have a subscription $26 a month for three years.
[01:40:05.560 --> 01:40:13.240]   Nice. And as if that were enough, you can also get an accessory called the I bone.
[01:40:13.240 --> 01:40:19.000]   The I bone. It will go on sale January 11th. I don't know why they missed the holidays.
[01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:24.200]   Only in Japan, it costs a hundred ninety eight thousand yen. That's about $1700 plus
[01:40:24.200 --> 01:40:31.080]   $26. Sorry, this is the I bone is just a terrible name. I mean, does anyone do any
[01:40:31.080 --> 01:40:37.720]   market research? And that's on that side. I bone. I bone. That's the bone. Jesus. It's the
[01:40:37.720 --> 01:40:46.280]   bone with the I go bites is the iPhone. Okay. 40th birthday of the computer that started the
[01:40:46.280 --> 01:40:55.800]   graphic user interface revolution, the Xerox Alto, the computer November 10th was the 40th
[01:40:55.800 --> 01:41:03.000]   anniversary unveiled by Xerox executives in 1977, the computer history museum in Mountain View
[01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:08.440]   brought some of the park researchers who worked on the Alto together. John shock Dan Ingalls,
[01:41:08.440 --> 01:41:15.800]   Doug Bratz, Bob sprawl, Tom Maloy, Charles, some yaw. Simone and the David C. back. The
[01:41:15.800 --> 01:41:25.080]   the Alto had a mouse. It had windows. It had menus. I had a word processor. It looked a lot
[01:41:25.080 --> 01:41:31.320]   like a Mac, but it's cost a lot more. Nice. Was that the one that Doug Engelbart did the most
[01:41:31.320 --> 01:41:36.360]   demonstration? No, that was way. That was that was a lot earlier, but it was this
[01:41:37.480 --> 01:41:45.080]   Xerox is commercialized kind of version of the same thing. Yeah. And it was for office workers,
[01:41:45.080 --> 01:41:49.960]   was the idea, big old CRT though, and look at the curvature of the screen. And, you know, I mean,
[01:41:49.960 --> 01:41:56.600]   the world wasn't ready for that 40 years ago. All right, we're going to wrap it up.
[01:41:56.600 --> 01:42:02.840]   We're going to wrap it up because I think we're losing Kevin. What time is it? What time is it,
[01:42:02.840 --> 01:42:07.160]   Kevin? It's like the middle of the morning or something. Jesus. It's it's 20 to one. Yes.
[01:42:07.160 --> 01:42:12.040]   It's a big way. We'll wrap this up. You can go back to bed. I thank you for getting up and staying
[01:42:12.040 --> 01:42:16.760]   with us. I appreciate it. I want to talk about our sponsor 23 and me. And then we'll get our picks
[01:42:16.760 --> 01:42:25.480]   of the week out of the way. 23 and me is a fabulous personal genetic service that helps you understand
[01:42:25.480 --> 01:42:32.680]   what your 23 pairs of chromosomes tell you your DNA tells you about yourself, about your family.
[01:42:33.320 --> 01:42:38.920]   It is if nothing else, it's fun. I'm going to log into my 23 and me account because I want to show
[01:42:38.920 --> 01:42:43.240]   you all the things I know about myself. I did it a long time ago. I like it because it was easy
[01:42:43.240 --> 01:42:46.840]   there. You don't have to go to a clinic to get blood draw. You just spit into a little vial.
[01:42:46.840 --> 01:42:50.440]   It's then you want to get you mail it back within six to eight weeks. You're going to get your
[01:42:50.440 --> 01:42:54.600]   report. And the nice thing, the report is constantly being updated. So there's always
[01:42:54.600 --> 01:43:00.440]   new information. Since, for instance, you know, I'm getting messages from people who think they're
[01:43:00.440 --> 01:43:04.520]   related to me. That's the DNA relatives thing. And it's kind of cool. You have to give permission
[01:43:04.520 --> 01:43:08.840]   obviously. And so do they. It's not like, but it will help you. It's a relative finder. It will
[01:43:08.840 --> 01:43:16.840]   help you find relatives. And in fact, the relative finder found for me somebody who's definitely a
[01:43:16.840 --> 01:43:23.720]   cousin because his last name is the same as my grandma's maiden name. So that's cool. Anthony Jacobi.
[01:43:24.600 --> 01:43:33.160]   He and I share 3.44% of our DNA. So I can connect with him if I wanted to. That's kind of fun.
[01:43:33.160 --> 01:43:39.000]   Be careful though. This can also reveal information that maybe you don't want it revealed.
[01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:42.920]   Who hasn't sent me a note saying, yeah, I found out that my sister wasn't really my sister.
[01:43:42.920 --> 01:43:49.640]   Okay. You know, it's not a negative. I think it's kind of interesting to learn this stuff. You
[01:43:49.640 --> 01:43:56.840]   could find out also in the reports, things like where your family comes from 10,000 years, 100,000
[01:43:56.840 --> 01:44:02.440]   years. This is cool. This is for instance, here's the here's the maternal haplo group and it shows
[01:44:02.440 --> 01:44:10.360]   the migration of my mother's DNA line starting 180,000 years ago in Africa, moving north into the
[01:44:10.360 --> 01:44:16.760]   Middle East 59,000 years ago up north from there. And finally into Europe 47,000 years ago. That is
[01:44:16.760 --> 01:44:21.960]   so cool. You could find out how much Neanderthal. This is an example of something that's new.
[01:44:21.960 --> 01:44:29.640]   Only recently if they realized that the Homo sapiens has Neanderthal ancestry, they didn't for a long
[01:44:29.640 --> 01:44:36.200]   time. They didn't think that there was any interbreeding. But after they did the Neanderthal genome a
[01:44:36.200 --> 01:44:41.960]   few years ago, they were able to show that it's true. In fact, I have 265 Neanderthal variants
[01:44:42.520 --> 01:44:49.000]   on my DNA, which puts me in seventh place, my family and friends. You get all the scientific
[01:44:49.000 --> 01:44:53.800]   details too. So this is a great gift for somebody interested in genetics. You can,
[01:44:53.800 --> 01:44:59.320]   they have lots of information about this. And since genetics is the next big frontier, I think
[01:44:59.320 --> 01:45:03.080]   it's a great thing for young people to learn about. I think this would be a fun thing to do for
[01:45:03.080 --> 01:45:09.400]   the family. And right now they have a special Thanksgiving deal, which is fantastic. $49 per
[01:45:09.400 --> 01:45:14.840]   kit when you buy two or more. So get the whole family involved in 23andme.
[01:45:14.840 --> 01:45:24.520]   23andme.com/twit. That's the number two three, and then when your family gets together,
[01:45:24.520 --> 01:45:29.800]   you know, give it to them on Thanksgiving. And when they get back together for the Christmas
[01:45:29.800 --> 01:45:37.080]   holiday break, you can all talk about your DNA. It's really fun. You can also, you can also find
[01:45:37.080 --> 01:45:44.600]   a lot more, including traits, things like, you know, hairy backs and waxy ears and things like that.
[01:45:44.600 --> 01:45:52.520]   It's chin clefts. My height may be influenced by an Neanderthal variant in the LPP gene.
[01:45:52.520 --> 01:46:00.520]   Did you? I didn't know that really. 23andme.com/twit. Fascinating. A lot of fun and a great way to
[01:46:00.520 --> 01:46:09.400]   learn about genetics for the whole family. 23andme.com/twit. We can wrap things up. Matthew Ingram,
[01:46:09.400 --> 01:46:16.280]   great to have you from your new job, the Columbia Journalism Report, CJR.
[01:46:16.280 --> 01:46:21.000]   Is that, can I read that online? Do I have to subscribe to that? What is the deal with that?
[01:46:21.000 --> 01:46:27.400]   Yeah. No, you can read it online. Certain things that are in the magazine don't show up until after.
[01:46:27.640 --> 01:46:38.920]   It's CJR.org. Yeah. And I actually love it because I'm reading stuff all the time in it.
[01:46:38.920 --> 01:46:45.000]   Because it's really about our trade here, which is fascinating. And lots of good news.
[01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:49.720]   Yeah. Good interesting news in here. So I'm thrilled that you're there. It's great. Congratulations.
[01:46:49.720 --> 01:46:50.680]   Me too.
[01:46:50.680 --> 01:46:52.120]   Do you have a pick of the week for us?
[01:46:54.040 --> 01:46:57.960]   Well, I wanted to mention you probably talked about this on other shows. I have not.
[01:46:57.960 --> 01:47:01.240]   The new Firefox browser. In fact, I just installed. Quantum.
[01:47:01.240 --> 01:47:05.640]   I've been using it. And what's interesting is people might not have noticed because I'm on a
[01:47:05.640 --> 01:47:11.320]   Microsoft Surface. And it looks so much like Edge. They might have thought I was using Edge.
[01:47:11.320 --> 01:47:19.560]   So what's new in Quantum? The one thing I really noticed, it's fast. I haven't done a lot of
[01:47:19.560 --> 01:47:25.160]   research. Supposedly, it's a lot lighter in terms of data usage as well. So RAM and so on. But
[01:47:25.160 --> 01:47:35.160]   it's definitely fast. Loading, fast switching tabs. I don't know if you open routinely like 50 to
[01:47:35.160 --> 01:47:41.160]   100 tabs. But I do. And Chrome can really get bogged down because each tab is a separate
[01:47:41.160 --> 01:47:47.160]   memory process. And so you find yourself basically running out of RAM. I could open fewer tabs.
[01:47:47.800 --> 01:47:53.720]   But I'm hoping that Firefox will be able to do that better and sort of keep the speed up.
[01:47:53.720 --> 01:47:58.920]   And so far, it's a nice browser. Certainly speed wise, I'm impressed.
[01:47:58.920 --> 01:48:05.000]   It is. It has the plugins I need. I'm a big Chrome user, but you're right. Chrome is a
[01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:10.120]   pig and also a battery hog on some platforms. And so I've been playing with this and I really
[01:48:10.120 --> 01:48:15.880]   like it. And it supports the at least two extensions I really need, which were LastPass
[01:48:15.880 --> 01:48:22.760]   and UBlock Origin, the ad blocker. But there's a lot more built into it. And you can see all the
[01:48:22.760 --> 01:48:29.880]   add-ons in the add-ons store. And they have, I would say, parody, probably with Chrome in
[01:48:29.880 --> 01:48:34.600]   terms of extensions. I think they're close. Yeah. Yeah, there might be some things that they
[01:48:34.600 --> 01:48:40.520]   don't have that people want. So is it the same standard? Can a Chrome extension easily be ported
[01:48:40.520 --> 01:48:46.520]   over? Yes. I mean, basically, it used to be extensions were a fine reason weird. Now the
[01:48:46.520 --> 01:48:51.400]   JavaScript and you just need to wrap them slightly differently. You've got them on both. So they
[01:48:51.400 --> 01:48:55.480]   don't know where to converge in. Okay. So as people warm up, people need this. And it's interesting.
[01:48:55.480 --> 01:49:01.480]   Go ahead. It's interesting that Firefox, you can use Google as your default search engine.
[01:49:01.480 --> 01:49:07.480]   Again, that's a big change. Yeah. Yeah, you couldn't be for it because they did that big deal with
[01:49:07.480 --> 01:49:14.200]   Yahoo. But they've apparently walked away from that deal. And very smart. Before it was up,
[01:49:14.200 --> 01:49:19.560]   like it was a five year deal, but they walked away before the deal was up. So now they're back with
[01:49:19.560 --> 01:49:26.040]   Google. Nice. Well, I'm going to try it out for a while. My Firefox quantum, it's Firefox 57
[01:49:26.040 --> 01:49:35.320]   free download from Firefox.com. And I'll tell you one thing, it looks nice. It really is. And it
[01:49:35.320 --> 01:49:40.440]   does. Yeah, it feels faster. So yeah, very nice.
[01:49:40.440 --> 01:49:47.160]   How about you, Mr. Kevin Marks, a pick for us? I've got a couple of things. I mean,
[01:49:47.160 --> 01:49:56.440]   I'll go with the less obvious one first, which is shortcut. So shortcut is a tool that was built
[01:49:56.440 --> 01:50:00.760]   by a bunch of people I know for this American life. And then what they want to do is get people
[01:50:00.760 --> 01:50:07.320]   share parts of their show. Oh, we need this. Yeah, no, you like this. But it needs transcripts.
[01:50:07.320 --> 01:50:11.080]   This is your challenge. You have to have transcripts for this to work. So basically,
[01:50:11.080 --> 01:50:17.160]   you select some text in the transcript and it constructs a little movie for you. Social media.
[01:50:17.160 --> 01:50:25.880]   Nice. Oh my gosh. That's super handy. So now it's open source, which is fantastic,
[01:50:25.880 --> 01:50:29.800]   which means you can sort it on your own podcast network. But if you have a have
[01:50:29.800 --> 01:50:36.360]   a product, Leo. But so if you go to the second link I put in there,
[01:50:36.360 --> 01:50:43.400]   shortcut this American life.org. You can pick the show, you can start some text and it constructs
[01:50:43.400 --> 01:50:51.800]   this nice movie from it. Wow. So select some text on that page. So this is the transcript.
[01:50:51.800 --> 01:50:57.000]   So that's one thing we'd have to have a transcript. And then it constructs the video for you.
[01:50:57.000 --> 01:51:02.440]   The match is the transcript and plays it. Oh, and even plays the text. It's audio only. So it's not a
[01:51:02.440 --> 01:51:08.840]   book. It's not a GIF of the video because we do video. No, it's not. So this is this.
[01:51:08.840 --> 01:51:12.760]   It's just, you know, it's close to your use case. You can work on this and talk to the guys. But
[01:51:12.760 --> 01:51:18.760]   the point is you didn't generate the interest. This is interesting for me is that sharing audio
[01:51:18.760 --> 01:51:23.480]   clips is quite hard. Sharing video clips is easy. So they make a video clip for your audio clip.
[01:51:23.480 --> 01:51:29.720]   And that's what you share. It's always been a challenge for us because, well, and having the
[01:51:29.720 --> 01:51:34.760]   text is also good because this could be on a Facebook page or Twitter feed and people would
[01:51:34.760 --> 01:51:40.120]   have to turn on the audio or anything. They can read it. This has always been an issue for us.
[01:51:40.120 --> 01:51:44.360]   So this was, you know, they work with the use case that they had, which was this American
[01:51:44.360 --> 01:51:49.560]   life actually transcribes all their shows and they did the work to sing them out. And so which
[01:51:49.560 --> 01:51:53.400]   means you can do this. But the challenge is for other podcasts is you've got to do the
[01:51:53.400 --> 01:51:57.400]   transcription work. But once you do that, I wish it was nice ability to share it.
[01:51:57.400 --> 01:52:03.880]   I wish more of them had transcripts. I find I don't have time to listen to a lot of the
[01:52:03.880 --> 01:52:08.760]   podcasts that I'd like to listen to, but I would read them. You know, we paid for transcripts for
[01:52:08.760 --> 01:52:14.040]   a few of the shows for a long time and no, we, our analytics told us nobody ever looked at them.
[01:52:14.840 --> 01:52:20.200]   Really? So we just recently stopped, of course. It's expensive to get good transcripts.
[01:52:20.200 --> 01:52:23.960]   Is expensive. No, it has expensive and synchronization is also hard. I mean,
[01:52:23.960 --> 01:52:27.480]   it seems like a throw machine learning at it problem to me. But.
[01:52:27.480 --> 01:52:35.240]   Yeah. Well, you've seen the machine transcripts on YouTube and stuff. They're not very good.
[01:52:35.240 --> 01:52:42.600]   But it's a starting point. They're like, you know, they haven't thrown the sort of
[01:52:42.600 --> 01:52:48.120]   the current neural networks. So I can see that coming. Yeah.
[01:52:48.120 --> 01:52:55.080]   Okay, I like it. Feeltrain.com.
[01:52:55.080 --> 01:53:00.280]   And you could find out more about that. You've got an indie webcam coming up in Austin.
[01:53:00.280 --> 01:53:04.200]   Austin said the first one in Austin, which is great.
[01:53:04.200 --> 01:53:09.080]   Because Austin is a great place to go for conferences. It's coming up in December,
[01:53:09.640 --> 01:53:12.920]   which I think is still comfortable there. Oh, Austin.
[01:53:12.920 --> 01:53:13.720]   Nice year round.
[01:53:13.720 --> 01:53:18.520]   7th and 10th. Yeah. Well, it gets a little chilly, but it's okay. It's still a good city.
[01:53:18.520 --> 01:53:25.400]   So sign up for that going on. I wish I could go. I'm going to be in the UK in December,
[01:53:25.400 --> 01:53:26.920]   the 9th and 10th. But.
[01:53:26.920 --> 01:53:33.640]   The indie web to find out more indie webcam. And there's when you get to
[01:53:33.640 --> 01:53:41.160]   indie web, there's a lot of other great resources for keeping the web open and free and independent
[01:53:41.160 --> 01:53:45.880]   of the big companies, including the homebrew website, the indie webcam meetings.
[01:53:45.880 --> 01:53:51.160]   And lots of there is actually what in San Francisco tonight, if you're, I think you can still get
[01:53:51.160 --> 01:53:54.040]   that. Okay. Yeah, no, it's only. It's not even you.
[01:53:54.040 --> 01:53:56.680]   Yeah, if you want to drive south, I could run out of here and go.
[01:53:56.680 --> 01:54:02.040]   Ladies and gentlemen, I thank you. I especially thank our hosts. Jeff Jarvis had to run. But
[01:54:02.040 --> 01:54:07.400]   of course he is always on the show. And we love Jeff. You'll find his blog at buzzmachine.com,
[01:54:07.400 --> 01:54:12.760]   his books online, including what would Google do private parts, geek sparing gifts.
[01:54:12.760 --> 01:54:16.040]   And he's a professor of journalism. If you're lucky enough to be in the graduate school of
[01:54:16.040 --> 01:54:20.840]   journalism at CUNY, you, you probably have some encounters with Mr. J.
[01:54:20.840 --> 01:54:25.320]   We thank him for joining us. Of course, Kevin Marks at indie web.org
[01:54:26.040 --> 01:54:35.640]   in the middle of the night in the Amsterdam in a plain clothes. I don't know, I ran out of words.
[01:54:35.640 --> 01:54:41.480]   I'm at a health data conference. I mean, that's health data conference.
[01:54:41.480 --> 01:54:45.160]   Well, you better get your sleep because you don't want to drift off tomorrow morning.
[01:54:45.160 --> 01:54:49.320]   Thank you so much for being here. I really appreciate it, Kevin. Also, Matthew Ingram,
