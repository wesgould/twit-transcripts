[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   Wait a minute. Now I've got to go back to the front page. Why don't I see Kevin?
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   If you click on the story, you'll see the photo I didn't put is the top photo in the story.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   And I was like, Kevin, I don't think I can see. He's running. Oh, Lord.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   He's wearing a smart vest with bulky attachment for the smarts.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   If you ever want to borrow it for reposing. Actually, Kevin looks fine.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   I just was like, I just don't. That's not what I want on my site. It's a little boy band. It's a little.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   Yeah. It's our version of the Met Gala. Just thinking about that way. Oh, Lord. Oh, Lord.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   That way before we get to the Met Gala, I better introduce this guy right here.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   Jeff Jarvis is the director of the townite center for entrepreneurial journalism at the.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   Great.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   Graduate school journalism at the city of University of New York.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   If you just try to. There's no explanation. Once you said Craig Newmark, there's nothing else.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   Nothing else. The said a number of people when Craig was on a couple of weeks ago,
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   said, why was that guy floating above you on the show?
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   Craig Newmark of Craigslist. That's all you have to say.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   And there was a great. There was a great tweet the other day.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   Somebody just came on and said, I'm staying up all night wondering whether Craigslist was started by a guy named Craig.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   And Craig, of course, retweeted it and said, same here.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   Craig, as we learned, is working on his material.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   He's working with an actual comedian.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   And he's actually very dryly funny.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   Oh, he's very dry. He's so dry. You don't know he's joking.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   And then you go, Oh, that was a, that's funny.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   Craig is a martini. Yeah. With a martini. Oh, no, no, yeah.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   He's very ruthless. That is hands on photography host Ant Pruitt all the way over to our left here.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   Of course, the not only the host of hands on photography,
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   but he's also the community manager in our club, Twit.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   And we really appreciate the job. He's doing great AMA with Michael Sargent.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   Do you have some come up this week?
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   Not this week, but next week, the 24th.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   We have this weekend in a price. I believe me and a loved one.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   Nope. Nope. That's not next week.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   Oh, you want to talk next week?
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   Oh, next week we're going to have fun.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   Game night. Yes.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   Next week we're going to do game times.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   I'll be able to sit down. We're going to play jack box games and just shoot the you're welcome to join Stacey will.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   What are what are Jack box games?
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   They're funny little off the wall games that you can play online with the group of people as long as you have a computer.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   Remember, you don't know Jack the game. You don't know Jack. It was basically trivial pursuit.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   Oh, okay. So there's a bunch of different.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   They branched off from you don't know Jack to the Jack box, which is a bunch of kind of, you know, fact.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   Check it out. What are y'all doing this?
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   This will be after quiet on Friday, September 24th. I believe roughly 3 p.m.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   Because, you know, sometimes twice.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   Because he's a little bit longer.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   And you would love it, by the way. It's Stacey. You would be so good.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   You would have you do tabletop gaming. I bet you.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   I do. And I do trivia.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   But it is. I will tell you.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   It is Fika, but we'll see.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   Wait, what?
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   She might have a thing she does with her daughter.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   What is it Friday?
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   It's Friday Fika. Fika is a Swedish tradition around three o'clock or so.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   You have a coffee and a small cake.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   Oh, speaking of small cakes. It's a day I learn.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   I got to thank Clarence Christian.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   We were talking on, we were talking on Mac break weekly about
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   this season is apple cider donut season.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   Right, Jeff?
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   You know about that.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   Yeah. I'm here.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   I'm here in Apple.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   Yeah. So Clarence, we were talking about Clarence sent me some apple cider donuts
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   from Stan Donuts and coffee in Los Angeles.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   Are you going to share?
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   Yeah, I'll share.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   So this is the best thing about work from home.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   We sent all the employees home.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   They came yesterday.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   They're all yours.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   And they're still here. I got plenty.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   They're really good.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   So thank you, Clarence. I appreciate these are really outstanding.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   You could tell they smell like apple.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   They're like apple for apple fritters.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   Aren't you glad you're not on that stupid diet anymore?
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   Keto thing?
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   I mixed feelings about it.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   I've had three of these before.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   Maybe not so good, but that's not all.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   It was a big haul.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   All of this stuff came in the mail yesterday.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   Here's an email from Marco Gentile.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   I hope I'm saying your name right.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   That's how I would say it.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   Marco Gentile.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   In your last week episode, the subject of Bucatini pasta came out.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   Did you get Bucatini?
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   I'm going to be so mad.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   I couldn't resist.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   But pull this package of...
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   Remember his name Marco Gentile?
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   Gentile Bucatini pasta.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   He says his great grandfather started the pasta factory.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   Unfortunately, it's no longer in the family, but the tradition is carried on.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   His father emigrated from Cerento in 1955 after marrying his mother who was born just down
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   the road in San Rafael in 1956.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   So it's the same age as me.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   He says, well, there's more, but he says he wants more right-wing people on the show.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   That's okay.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   I'm really open to the bribe.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   Pastifico Gentile.com.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   P-A-S-T-I-F-I-C-I-O.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   Pasta Ficchio Gentile.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   G-I-N-T-I-L-E.com.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   Actually, you might recognize his snowflake.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   I'm very excited.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   Look like Mr. Doncom?
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   Yeah, and not only that, look at this.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   It comes with my very own...
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   Anaglific blue-green glasses for 3D viewing.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   Yes, this is his new book that you were plugging, right?
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   Macro photography.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   University of Ficchio.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   Thank you very much Doncomer Echka.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   He's famous for these snowflake pictures.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   You've had them on hands on photography.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   But he's also the king of macro.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   Which is good timing because I don't know if this counts, but Apple just announced macro capability
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   and it's new iPhones yesterday.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   That's great.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   Look at this picture.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   Look at this picture.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   Look at that ant.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   Look at that ant.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   This dude is so nice and...
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   Ant for ant.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   Doncom is really...
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   Thank you Doncomer Echka.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   Thank you Clarence for the donuts.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   Thank you Marco for the past.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   I am so jealous.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   You got a nice haul there today.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   That's why I like work from home because it's just me and my treats.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   I was thinking about having Taco Bell chicken taco sandwiches delivered to you today.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   It's okay.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   We have Wednesday is a gas station sushi day.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   So that's a time-honic tradition.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   I'm going to eat it till it kills me and it might kill me at any moment.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   Facebook.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   A surprise.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   Facebook says...
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   Actually Facebook doesn't say it.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   The Wall Street Journal says it.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   So maybe this is suspect.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   They say Facebook has known that Instagram is toxic for teens but didn't do anything about
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.320]   the company documents show its own in-depth research, a significant teen mental health
[00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:54.600]   issue that Facebook plays down in public.
[00:10:54.600 --> 00:11:00.520]   I guess I probably should go to you, Mr. Morlpanek.
[00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:04.560]   Anything to say about this?
[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:05.960]   It's what I always say in this case.
[00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:10.880]   We need more data out of them and they're foolish not to get it out so we know and that's
[00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:13.080]   why it leaks like this.
[00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:20.240]   What I read from people about this is that from the researchers, that researchers I know
[00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:27.160]   know people inside Facebook who try to bring these things out and try to improve them and
[00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:32.200]   try to fix them and know what's going on and then they get stopped by politics and economy.
[00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:33.600]   And that's the disturbing part of this.
[00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:35.240]   That's the difficult part.
[00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:40.640]   But from a research perspective, every researcher I've seen just is dying to get their hands
[00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:41.640]   on this kind of data.
[00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:42.640]   So we can know.
[00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:47.200]   Yeah, yeah, I, as some people hate anything Facebook does, I'm rather the same way about
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:48.280]   Robert Murdoch.
[00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:52.040]   So I do come to it with suspicion from the journal perspective, but that doesn't mean
[00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:53.640]   that there isn't something here.
[00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:55.040]   It looks like there's some racism.
[00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:56.840]   It looks like there's some good journalism.
[00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:57.840]   Yeah, they're there.
[00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:58.840]   Yeah.
[00:11:58.840 --> 00:11:59.840]   They have some deep sources.
[00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:01.240]   Now I have to point out that.
[00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:02.480]   Can we specify something?
[00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:03.840]   Yeah, go ahead.
[00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:06.240]   This is for this isn't Facebook the site.
[00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:07.240]   This is Instagram.
[00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:08.240]   Instagram.
[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:09.240]   Yes.
[00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:10.240]   Facebook.
[00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:11.240]   Instagram.
[00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:12.240]   Instagram.
[00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:16.800]   And I should point out that magazines have done this to young girls, particularly, but
[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:18.200]   women in general for years.
[00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:22.360]   This is not my wife's reaction is that, you know, Facebook didn't invent eighth grade
[00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:24.560]   girls being awful to each other.
[00:12:24.560 --> 00:12:29.720]   But did invent showing them these photos all the time.
[00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:33.600]   So here's it's a protein girl, parent of a teen girl.
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:34.600]   Yeah.
[00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:35.600]   Yeah.
[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:36.600]   You have such a wide variety.
[00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:41.160]   And I will say, okay, I had an eating disorder.
[00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:43.800]   It is not solely because you look at pictures.
[00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:47.320]   It is a function of anxiety is a function of trying to control your life.
[00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:56.280]   I will say that the internet and social media has made it very difficult for girls in particular.
[00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:58.040]   There is so much research.
[00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:03.480]   It's not solely related to Instagram or Facebook about how unhealthy these things can be for
[00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:04.480]   them.
[00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:08.800]   It'd be really interesting to look at it in the context of the pandemic because they've
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:10.920]   lost their true social outlet.
[00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:14.000]   Now it's just normal girls at all anymore.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   Yeah.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:20.080]   So can I just say something for something easy way to point the finger at Instagram because
[00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:23.280]   they are so big and make it so accessible.
[00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:24.280]   This is this content.
[00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:31.720]   It's also, I do think magazine editors, when you told them what magazine editors came out
[00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:34.520]   and started working on things like body positivity.
[00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:36.560]   Yes, it took time, but they listened.
[00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:38.840]   They talked about photo shopping.
[00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:45.400]   There's a huge backlash that in response to the research that people were doing showing
[00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:48.680]   how it affected young girls, right?
[00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:53.800]   Instagram and Facebook are not willing to say, oh, this is true.
[00:13:53.800 --> 00:14:00.480]   And honestly, I don't know if it's because it's kind of a misogynistic culture there
[00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:01.840]   that just doesn't care.
[00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:06.920]   I mean, they're clearly not focused on the wellbeing of people on the platform, right?
[00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:14.120]   But I mean, there is a benefit to a bunch of unhappy girls spending a lot of time wanting
[00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:20.000]   to be something else and spending that time visualizing that through their platform.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:24.760]   What would be even worse is if they were using it to advertise to those girls things
[00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:30.440]   like diet supplements and exercise plans and other products designed to play into that
[00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:33.960]   which I wouldn't be at all surprised that they are.
[00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:36.040]   I think Facebook to answer this.
[00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:39.640]   And by the way, I completely defer to Stacy on this.
[00:14:39.640 --> 00:14:40.640]   She's a mother.
[00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:41.640]   She's a woman.
[00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:42.640]   First of all, she's the mother of a young girl.
[00:14:42.640 --> 00:14:44.920]   So she is the expert on this.
[00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:51.520]   But I would say Facebook is an order of magnitude difference from a magazine or not Facebook
[00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:52.920]   about Instagram, Facebook too.
[00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:56.680]   But Instagram, when you're looking at Instagram, you're looking at people you think are like
[00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:57.680]   you.
[00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:01.480]   You would think in your mind, they're your peers.
[00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:08.400]   And when you see those in beautiful environments and having a great time, parties, parties
[00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:12.820]   and they look great and they have chiseled abs and all of that stuff, you I think it's
[00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:16.680]   worse than seeing a star, a celebrity in a magazine.
[00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:19.400]   I think it's it's really even worse.
[00:15:19.400 --> 00:15:24.360]   But in the same stars from the magazines, let's Stacy, go ahead.
[00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:25.360]   Oh, no.
[00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:29.560]   And on Instagram, a lot of these girls are following their friends or their friends of
[00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:34.240]   friends and they're following their boyfriend like to girl in a bikini.
[00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:35.440]   And so they got to follow that girl.
[00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:37.400]   Because who the heck is that?
[00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:38.720]   Yeah, that's a good point.
[00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:42.120]   It may even be your friends, even if there's this.
[00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:51.040]   So I mean, the evidence, according to this research, 32% of teen girls said, and this
[00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:52.040]   is interesting.
[00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:58.160]   When they felt bad about their bodies, they already felt that way to your points, Stacy.
[00:15:58.160 --> 00:16:00.720]   Instagram made them feel worse.
[00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:01.720]   Yeah.
[00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:11.920]   So the real issue is among teens who reported suicidal thoughts, 13% of British users, 6%
[00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:17.480]   of American users traced the desire to kill themselves to Instagram.
[00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:19.840]   That's really serious.
[00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:24.920]   You know, feeling bad about how you look or feeling bad about your body.
[00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:28.640]   Maybe eating disorders or one thing, but suicides and other.
[00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:30.400]   That's a really that's a permanent.
[00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:31.400]   Yeah.
[00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:36.240]   Well, in suicide, I mean, there's so much research already out there about how like if someone
[00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:40.440]   kills themselves in a school, they will others will tend to do that.
[00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:41.920]   It's it's it's epidemic.
[00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:48.760]   So when your community is online, it's it's wider reaching, but they still feel like your
[00:16:48.760 --> 00:16:50.320]   community.
[00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:52.840]   And that can be a real problem.
[00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:58.280]   Just like, Oh, well, this person, you know, did it and they get the attention.
[00:16:58.280 --> 00:17:00.120]   They get the outpouring of grief.
[00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:05.760]   They probably if you're I mean, if you're suicidal too, it's they ended the pain that
[00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:07.200]   you don't see an into.
[00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:11.680]   So there's these numbers from Wall Street Journal.
[00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:13.200]   I don't have no reason not to believe them.
[00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:20.120]   40% of Instagram's users are 22 years old and younger, 22 million teens log into Instagram
[00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:23.000]   every day compared to 5 million on Facebook.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.960]   Facebook is of course losing young people.
[00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:25.960]   All right.
[00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:29.000]   Instagram is where there is where many of them have gone.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   Teens in the US spend 50% more times on Instagram than they do on Facebook.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:37.640]   So that's why we're really focused on Instagram.
[00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:42.800]   In this case, you know, I look at this stuff and in
[00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:48.400]   the first thing that comes to my mind is are is where the parents when it comes to these
[00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:50.640]   different influences out there.
[00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:58.800]   I know what Instagram is doing or has allegedly done is pretty craptastic and feeding this
[00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:01.880]   content out there when they have all the control of the algorithm.
[00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:05.920]   They're feeding the stuff out there that's going to get the likes and the activity and
[00:18:05.920 --> 00:18:09.600]   keep people on the platform because that's that's their job.
[00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:11.360]   That's where they make their money.
[00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:18.160]   You know, but at the same time, where is mom, dad or uncle or whoever to say, hey, you know
[00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:20.440]   that's none of that's real, right?
[00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:22.120]   That person is totally faking.
[00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:24.520]   So love you for who you are.
[00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:27.080]   You know, why doesn't that gets talked about it?
[00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:31.520]   So, Ann, first, first, I want to thank Stacy.
[00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:34.800]   Very sincerely here for sharing.
[00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:37.600]   Nothing, you know, makes you expect you to do that.
[00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:43.280]   And for you to just share that I think is generous because it tells people that they're
[00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:49.240]   not alone and that there is a beyond and I think that's critical.
[00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:57.600]   And I don't want to I don't want to invade the privacy of my own loved ones.
[00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:04.360]   But in some response to you, Ann, as Stacy just said, it's it's it's bigger than one
[00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:05.760]   cause.
[00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:07.960]   It doesn't it's not caused by that.
[00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:11.280]   It can be made worse, but there's so much pressure.
[00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:16.960]   What we're doing to our children today in the in the anxiety is raised.
[00:19:16.960 --> 00:19:23.800]   It's been raised for some time and look at things like the college entrance scandal.
[00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:28.920]   Look at the testing and what we do to people look at that at all kinds of measures of
[00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:35.640]   trying to perform, whether it's socially, athletically, academically, collegially, collegially,
[00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:40.640]   whatever it is, the pressure we're putting our kids under these days is awful and they're
[00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:42.800]   cracking under it.
[00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:45.880]   And we can't look at one cause.
[00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:46.880]   You're right.
[00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:50.800]   Parents have have have have have have responsibility here.
[00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:56.960]   But even if we turned off even if you took off their way, their phone tomorrow, those
[00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:58.920]   anxieties and those pressures are there.
[00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:02.920]   Now, again, I'm going to emphasize, I agree, agree that Facebook making it worse, Instagram
[00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:05.400]   making it worse is something we got to look at.
[00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:08.960]   And I put a a a threat up from a researcher, the researchers, less than the researchers
[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:14.120]   I respect here is about them from your name, Gerard, I think your name is saying we can't
[00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:16.400]   invent interact interventions.
[00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:20.960]   We can't figure out what to do about this unless we have the data to make suggestions.
[00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:27.600]   And to me, that's the real scandal here is that we can't get the data out of these companies
[00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:31.200]   because they're scared because they're going to show some things that are bad, but but
[00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:34.840]   they've got to, the government's going to come after them to get it.
[00:20:34.840 --> 00:20:39.080]   So they've got to figure out how to get researchers involved so we can try to understand the full
[00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:43.000]   impact so we can try to create appropriate interventions.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.960]   And now that's nine to impossible.
[00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:56.000]   Facebook when asked by the Senate to hand over some of this information, they told the
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:01.840]   senators that its internal research is proprietary and quote kept confidential to promote frank
[00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:06.080]   and open dialogue and brainstorming internally.
[00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:11.000]   This was in response to Richard Blumenthal and Marsha Blackburn in a letter they sent to
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.840]   Mark Zuckerberg some months ago.
[00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:19.040]   Blumenthal said Facebook's answers were so evasive failing to even respond to all our
[00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:20.040]   questions.
[00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:22.440]   They really raised questions about what Facebook might be hiding.
[00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:23.440]   Yeah.
[00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:28.240]   Marcery who's the head Adam Mossery who's the head of Instagram says we don't send research
[00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:34.280]   out to regulators on a regular basis for a number of reasons.
[00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:39.560]   But he added Facebook should figure out a way to share high level overviews of what
[00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:43.640]   the company is learning and wanted to give external researchers access to Facebook's
[00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:44.640]   data.
[00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:46.240]   We know how that went with another set of data.
[00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:47.240]   We talked about that.
[00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:53.840]   Well, they're and they're on the privacy regulations did get in the way.
[00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:55.640]   Sure.
[00:21:55.640 --> 00:22:00.040]   This is I completely understand it.
[00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:06.560]   Troubling for parents, troubling for everybody.
[00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:10.520]   I've always seen this is a problem in social media in general is that people always show
[00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:14.440]   the best slice of their life and so media.
[00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:19.240]   Yeah, I spent a lot of time to counseling my own kids who have grown up with social media,
[00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:24.160]   counseling them not to compare their insides with other people's outsides because you're
[00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:26.640]   not seeing that's not at Apple's to oranges.
[00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:29.720]   You're not seeing the troubles those people have.
[00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:31.720]   Go ahead, Stacy.
[00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:35.720]   Oh, I was going to.
[00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:37.600]   They also cater to a community.
[00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:42.840]   So a lot of these what happens is you become known for something and then that becomes
[00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:47.840]   your personality like you hear all the kids are like, okay, liking pumpkin spice lattes
[00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:50.040]   is not your whole personality, right?
[00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:55.840]   But it does and it's because they're driving after a demographic that like it's on TikTok,
[00:22:55.840 --> 00:22:57.000]   it's a certain demographic.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:00.040]   If it's on Instagram, it's this set of people, right?
[00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:01.440]   This hashtag.
[00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:08.200]   So then you you're not only curating, you're not necessarily curating your best self.
[00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:12.240]   You're curating the self that gets you the attention you think you want.
[00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:17.920]   And I think that's a really important thing here because being beautiful and skinny gets
[00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:23.640]   you a lot of attention being sad and suicidal kids, you attention.
[00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:24.640]   Yeah.
[00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:31.440]   So in a some sense, you become this what you're trying not what you're trying to do.
[00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:33.960]   A presentation or more this personality.
[00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:37.080]   It's about the presentation, not about you.
[00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:41.600]   And then I would also say just because I think this is an important thing and also I'm a
[00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:43.440]   parent, so I'm sensitive and in you too.
[00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:47.000]   And kids at this age.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:51.240]   You can say where the parents, but you can only do so much.
[00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:54.920]   And I talk to a daughter, for example, and I'm sure you talk to your sons, but you know,
[00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:58.320]   you're, I mean, it's developmentally appropriate that they're going to lie to you and do other
[00:23:58.320 --> 00:23:59.320]   things, right?
[00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:00.320]   You want them to do that.
[00:24:00.320 --> 00:24:02.720]   At some point, at some point, the control is in there.
[00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:06.960]   After sixth grade, just as research has shown this consistently after sixth grade, I know
[00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:10.560]   this my, I read the research.
[00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:14.200]   Peers have a much larger influence on kids than their family.
[00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:15.200]   Yeah.
[00:24:15.200 --> 00:24:19.120]   So the whole group is everything and your peer group suddenly now has expanded with this
[00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:23.480]   with this kind of social media to a friends of friends of friends of friends, a so much
[00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:26.720]   larger group.
[00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:27.720]   That's your.
[00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:31.680]   I mean, I'm not saying that you shouldn't talk to your kids and you totally should and
[00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:36.560]   you could try to ban, you know, Instagram, although so many social interactions now happen
[00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:42.160]   through that and like, you know, so like, if you don't get invited to the parties or,
[00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:43.160]   you know,
[00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:46.560]   yeah, I don't know what the answer is.
[00:24:46.560 --> 00:24:47.560]   I agree with it.
[00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:48.560]   Straight tough.
[00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:52.680]   I don't think there is companies can immunize kids against this very effectively.
[00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:55.680]   I do not think I do think companies have a role.
[00:24:55.680 --> 00:25:01.160]   Like, I do think if Mark Zuckerberg actually gave two flips about this and maybe he will
[00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:03.960]   when his kids grow up, I don't know.
[00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:10.400]   Then, you know, there are things that you can do and, you know, you even see this at
[00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:15.000]   like, I know when TikTok, they they're like, this is a professional person doing this.
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:19.600]   I don't know if that has any sort of influence, but they're they're trying to set some things
[00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:25.280]   and I think it's important to be proactive and they're most assuredly not proactive about
[00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:28.000]   any of the potential harms of any of their platforms.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   Okay, that's all.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.360]   Well, Stacy, again, I think that there are people.
[00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:33.160]   This is this is what troubles me most.
[00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:35.240]   There are people inside.
[00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:36.240]   This is what this reveals.
[00:25:36.240 --> 00:25:39.560]   There are people inside who were studying this who were saying that there are issues who
[00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:42.880]   were trying to get used with the data they had and the information they had who did know
[00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:44.640]   things and it's stopped.
[00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:49.040]   You know, there there are some cases where they don't know and then we really don't know
[00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:52.480]   what influence Facebook had on the election of Donald Trump, I think.
[00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:59.040]   But in this case, we see from this the people knew something and tried to do something and
[00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:03.520]   it's it's the fact that it stopped the troubles me most about the company.
[00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:04.520]   Yeah.
[00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:09.480]   And so at the very least, I think we can all agree that Facebook needs to start handing
[00:26:09.480 --> 00:26:14.720]   this research over research over to researchers that that others need other eyes need to see
[00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:15.720]   this.
[00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:22.120]   And it and you know, of course, the other story that has been widely reported is that Facebook
[00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:28.280]   sent misinformation to reporters on researchers on misinformation that they they misinformed
[00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:31.320]   them about the data said about where it came from.
[00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:32.800]   I'm getting the headache.
[00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:39.200]   So Facebook is clearly at wrong about how it's handling this stuff.
[00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:41.760]   They need to start being more open about that stuff.
[00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:45.200]   And if they don't do it themselves, somebody needs to make them do it because that's that's
[00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:46.840]   problematic.
[00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:47.840]   That was my question.
[00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:53.480]   I was asked if they send this information over to third party researchers and these
[00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:57.680]   third party researchers come up with all of this analysis and says, Hey, this needs to
[00:26:57.680 --> 00:26:58.680]   be done.
[00:26:58.680 --> 00:26:59.680]   That needs to be done.
[00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:02.680]   So on and so forth, Facebook and Instagram says, Hey, does this happen?
[00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:03.680]   This is our company.
[00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:07.160]   We want to run this the way we want to, you know, we're sorry, but we want to run this
[00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:08.400]   the way we want to.
[00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:09.400]   What's the next step?
[00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:11.080]   Well, I don't know what the next step.
[00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:13.240]   The first step is that they didn't hear the data over.
[00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:15.080]   They haven't even done that yet.
[00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:19.880]   And at that point, I think Facebook should want this input.
[00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:26.120]   They should want to share this information with experts in the field and then find out
[00:27:26.120 --> 00:27:29.880]   and and you know, if Facebook doesn't act, then there's other then there's other steps.
[00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:35.240]   But step one is Facebook needs to enlist some expertise outside of Facebook.
[00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:39.520]   And this is the essence of the high transatlantic high level where he wrote my content moderation
[00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:45.280]   freedom of expression, which I was a part was just this that and to my mind, it starts
[00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:47.920]   with the company saying, here's how we'll be judged.
[00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:51.680]   We warrant with government, we will hand over data to researchers.
[00:27:51.680 --> 00:27:55.640]   We will do it in a way that protects privacy and have an agreement to do that.
[00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:57.880]   And you can hold us accountable then.
[00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:01.600]   That's the process rather than one size fits all regulation was saying, get rid of all
[00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:02.600]   the bad stuff.
[00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:03.600]   You're ruining society.
[00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:04.600]   That's not helpful.
[00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:05.600]   But that's true of everybody.
[00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:08.360]   What's the problem here is to the New York Times understand what's going on.
[00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:09.880]   The New York Times should do that.
[00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:14.840]   They had for a while they had a really good ombudsman and then they got rid of the position.
[00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:22.800]   Everybody who is in the public eye has a responsibility to to be open so that yes, so they can be regulated
[00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:28.360]   if we have to, but more, you know, to the point, at least in the short term so that
[00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:33.520]   we can all agree on making this a better, safer place for the most vulnerable people
[00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:34.520]   among us.
[00:28:34.520 --> 00:28:38.480]   And that's, you know, we don't want to have children feeling terrible about the growing
[00:28:38.480 --> 00:28:42.400]   up feeling terrible about themselves because some company doesn't want to do anything
[00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:43.400]   about it.
[00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:45.960]   That's that's not okay.
[00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:49.480]   And that that would be a good reason to regulate big tech.
[00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:54.880]   On the other hand, I will channel Jeff Jarvis, actually Adam Mosseri is channeling you saying,
[00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:58.000]   but we do a lot of good things and it is absolutely true.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.160]   And so release that too, right?
[00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:04.120]   So are we going to talk about the Metacium or?
[00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:06.880]   Yeah, let's talk about it's a.
[00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:13.880]   So this is actually really interesting point of Adam, the Met Gala, which used to be a fund
[00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:18.280]   where it still is a fundraiser for the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City or for the costume
[00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:19.280]   section there.
[00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:21.400]   It's a great costume institute.
[00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:22.400]   It's amazing.
[00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:23.400]   Really, too.
[00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:27.240]   And it became a very big socialite event where you'd have the biggest celebrities and
[00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:33.160]   socialites wearing amazing and crazy outfits and they would go to be photographed.
[00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:37.120]   Apparently Instagram now at least is a partial.
[00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:38.120]   What is the deal?
[00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:40.440]   What is Instagram's relationship to this now?
[00:29:40.440 --> 00:29:42.760]   Aren't they a co-sponsor co-host?
[00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:44.240]   There's co-host.
[00:29:44.240 --> 00:29:49.160]   What is the word for they gave a lot of money and they changed the writer.
[00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:50.160]   They changed it a lot.
[00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:51.320]   It's not a sponsor.
[00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:58.160]   Because fashion's biggest night out suddenly became influencers biggest night out.
[00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:00.480]   And they had actually been inviting.
[00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:06.000]   So this was actually a thing, but they had inviting influencers for quite some time.
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:10.880]   But what happened is, and I'm trying to find the relationship, the formal name of it.
[00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:12.120]   I'm trying to find it too.
[00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:16.760]   Oh, they're an official sponsor of the event.
[00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:23.440]   Now, Anna Winterra and her peeps have been for the last five or six years inviting various
[00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:26.440]   influencers to the Metcala.
[00:30:26.440 --> 00:30:33.640]   Now their live coverage has, they have some Instagram-esque, you know, photo opportunities
[00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:36.840]   and things like that.
[00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:41.640]   And there'll be like certain Instagram accounts that we're doing stuff for it.
[00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:47.320]   I think there were, I think it was mostly the society matrons who weren't happy that
[00:30:47.320 --> 00:30:49.160]   who is that?
[00:30:49.160 --> 00:30:52.000]   I just put up under line 129.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   129 is Instagram's table at the event.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:58.080]   See how many names we recognize.
[00:30:58.080 --> 00:31:02.680]   So yeah, I mean, whether we recognize them probably doesn't matter much, Jeff, because
[00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:03.680]   we aren't exactly.
[00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:04.680]   We're old farts.
[00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:06.680]   Yeah, we're not exactly with the kids.
[00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:08.320]   I'm not in old farts, but I couldn't tell you the first thing.
[00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:09.880]   You're not going to know.
[00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:12.080]   Lil Nas X was there for the first time.
[00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:13.080]   We know that one.
[00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:14.080]   I know.
[00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:15.080]   Yeah, her to him.
[00:31:15.080 --> 00:31:16.080]   Megan, these stallion.
[00:31:16.080 --> 00:31:17.080]   Megan, these stallion.
[00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:18.080]   You're an Alexander.
[00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:19.080]   Yeah.
[00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:23.160]   So, so we so we so we so we so we so we so we let's hear.
[00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:24.160]   Let's hear.
[00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:25.160]   So let's see.
[00:31:25.160 --> 00:31:27.160]   She's a she's a here's so weedy.
[00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:28.160]   All right.
[00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:29.160]   She's a singer.
[00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:30.160]   Yeah.
[00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:31.160]   Okay.
[00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:32.160]   So there's going to be some.
[00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:33.160]   Yeah.
[00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:34.160]   All right.
[00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:35.160]   Real clung and Beckham.
[00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:38.360]   So she's Victoria Beckham and she's always been there and David Beckham's daughter.
[00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:40.800]   They were wearing Valentino.
[00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:42.920]   Kid Cuddy wearing Valentino.
[00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:44.400]   Little baby wearing coach.
[00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:46.400]   Was it he canceled?
[00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:47.840]   Yes, that I do know.
[00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:51.800]   I don't know much of the canceled by what?
[00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:54.040]   He got up and had a homophobic rant.
[00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:55.800]   Oh, bye little baby.
[00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:59.960]   How about Simu you wearing Fendi for men?
[00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:01.920]   Yeah, Evan Mock wearing Tom Brown.
[00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:05.520]   I know Evan mock Natalia Bryant wearing Connor.
[00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:14.120]   I love Denise Rick Owens, Paloma Alesa, Alsasser wearing Zach Pozen, Jordan Alexander Christopher
[00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:15.320]   John Rogers.
[00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:16.880]   Preciously I love that name.
[00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:17.880]   I know Precious.
[00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:19.800]   She's an actually she's one of the top.
[00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:20.800]   No, this is precious.
[00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:25.080]   She's one of the top models for plus I love.
[00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:26.880]   This is not for us.
[00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:31.440]   Anyway, Adam, a sari wearing Bodie was at the table.
[00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:33.120]   I feel like it's for me.
[00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:34.120]   Yeah.
[00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:35.120]   It's for you.
[00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:36.120]   Wait a minute.
[00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:37.120]   I think we should have got a test.
[00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:40.120]   The Met Gala show is basically the picture in how to identify the people with the met
[00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:43.720]   gals for you or I love the Met Gala.
[00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:45.040]   I love fashion.
[00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:46.040]   Yeah.
[00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:50.240]   Yeah, if you love fashion, it's great because people wear also crazy stuff.
[00:32:50.240 --> 00:32:51.240]   This is actually very.
[00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:53.440]   This year was very boring.
[00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:57.320]   Yeah, very disappointing and the Instagram peeps.
[00:32:57.320 --> 00:32:59.520]   This most of this table was not very.
[00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:02.920]   I have no problem with fashion.
[00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:04.800]   Fashion is pretty fascinating.
[00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:11.000]   I think I've talked about before with how I enjoy the Halston docuseries.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:12.680]   Yeah, wasn't that good?
[00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:13.680]   I love that.
[00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:20.480]   Fashion is fascinating, but I this whole Met Gala thing, I knew nothing about it until
[00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:21.960]   about 24 hours ago.
[00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:28.720]   Oh, well, if you've been here last year, the end of the fall is a big, big thing for us.
[00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:33.840]   Stacy loves it.
[00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:40.960]   I think thanks to I think fashion has become much more accessible.
[00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:45.120]   High fashion become more and more accessible to people partly because of things like Halston,
[00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:48.400]   but also because of all the reality shows.
[00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:49.400]   Okay.
[00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:51.040]   The Cardash project runway.
[00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:53.200]   No, no, no, like project runway.
[00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:56.480]   I mean, I think people are it's much more accessible that used to be.
[00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:57.480]   Maybe can.
[00:33:57.480 --> 00:33:59.480]   So there's a big.
[00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:01.360]   Go ahead, Jeff.
[00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:02.360]   Go, Jeff.
[00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:03.360]   No, I was going to be grouchy.
[00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:04.360]   Go ahead.
[00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:05.360]   Okay, go ahead, Stacy.
[00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:06.360]   No grouches allowed.
[00:34:06.360 --> 00:34:12.760]   I was going to say either in 2018 or 2017 technology was actually a theme for the Met Gala.
[00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:16.320]   So they have like cool stuff, but the other thing.
[00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:18.120]   That's probably when we started covering it actually.
[00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:21.480]   I was just saying that's probably when we came back.
[00:34:21.480 --> 00:34:28.480]   There's Timothy Shemla.
[00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:31.480]   That's by if I knew I would tell you.
[00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:33.000]   It's kind of fun.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:37.560]   It's like the Academy Awards red carpet only with.
[00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:41.840]   No, it's supposed to be better because the Academy Awards red carpet is honestly all
[00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:43.920]   turned into prom.
[00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:44.920]   So very boring.
[00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:50.080]   But what's interesting is with like COVID and recessions, you can actually see the Ota
[00:34:50.080 --> 00:34:54.200]   Couture shows, so like the runway shows, their creations become more wearable.
[00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:58.640]   So New York Fashion Week was just this last week and all of their stuff was super commercial.
[00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:00.040]   I mean, it's super boring.
[00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:05.560]   So Met was actually our only chance to be like crazy stuff and it really didn't deliver.
[00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:06.560]   That's all.
[00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:07.560]   Okay.
[00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:08.560]   You're a little more flamboyant.
[00:35:08.560 --> 00:35:09.560]   Here's some.
[00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:10.560]   Here's some flamboyants.
[00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:11.800]   There you go.
[00:35:11.800 --> 00:35:12.800]   Yeah.
[00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:13.800]   You're right.
[00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:14.800]   I say monstress.
[00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:17.400]   It could have been more interesting this year.
[00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:18.400]   This was not.
[00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:21.720]   You know where the really interesting fashion was this year and I can't believe we're talking
[00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:22.720]   about this.
[00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:30.520]   MTV, these video music awards, the VMAs had some wild fashion.
[00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:32.920]   That still goes on, huh?
[00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:38.240]   Oh, and and see, I wrote that stuff off years ago.
[00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:40.560]   Actually, the VMAs were fun this year.
[00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:41.560]   They're fun.
[00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:44.960]   I am sadly in some sort of a bubble.
[00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:46.600]   You're good at getting old, man.
[00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:47.600]   It's okay.
[00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:48.600]   I'm not a fan of the rest of us.
[00:35:48.600 --> 00:35:51.040]   Uncle Lance, your uncle Lance.
[00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:58.760]   Oh, I don't know how he started covering this, but we can talk about Google now.
[00:35:58.760 --> 00:35:59.760]   That's fine.
[00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:01.080]   Let us let us just note.
[00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:05.920]   Let us just note that all the people who worked there had to wear masks, but the stars
[00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:08.880]   did in their display of ostentatian did not.
[00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:12.800]   Was it just for their photographs or did they have to?
[00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:14.600]   No, no, no, I think all around.
[00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:15.600]   You know, broad.
[00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:17.600]   Accinated in order to go.
[00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:18.600]   Oh, yeah.
[00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:19.600]   You know that.
[00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:20.600]   Broadway's open.
[00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:23.200]   There's this weird, weird, weird kind of intermediate stage where half the country's
[00:36:23.200 --> 00:36:28.720]   vaccinated and says it's over and the other half the country's in ICU with ventilators.
[00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:31.560]   And it's very, actually, no, they're the ones we're saying it's over or the ones weren't
[00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:32.560]   getting vaccinated.
[00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:33.560]   That's why we're in the problem we're in.
[00:36:33.560 --> 00:36:34.560]   It's very confusing.
[00:36:34.560 --> 00:36:37.760]   And I don't know what to do.
[00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:39.040]   Mandates, mandates.
[00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:40.040]   Yeah.
[00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:41.040]   Yeah.
[00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:42.040]   Let's take a break.
[00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:48.240]   Back, the ignoble prizes are out and the best scientific research of the year.
[00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:52.760]   We'll talk about that in just a little bit.
[00:36:52.760 --> 00:36:55.440]   I can't resist just going through a few of these.
[00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:57.960]   First a word though from our sponsor, Nureva.
[00:36:57.960 --> 00:36:59.400]   Love these guys.
[00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:07.640]   As you come back to work and you're wondering, what do we do in our huddle room and our conference
[00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:10.920]   room in our classroom?
[00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:14.800]   I've always said, pictures are fine, but audio is key.
[00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:21.240]   So when you're on a Zoom or a Skype or a Teams or a meeting, it's so important you have
[00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:22.240]   good audio.
[00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:24.760]   And that's why Nureva is such a great solution.
[00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:28.940]   There are plenty of simple plug and play audio solutions for huddle rooms, but getting
[00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:34.280]   full room might coverage, especially in a bigger room, a mid-size or large meeting or
[00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:39.000]   a classroom or learning space, has traditionally meant making a big leap into the complexity
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:45.240]   and cost of ProAV solutions, but Nureva is changing all that, simplifying almost every
[00:37:45.240 --> 00:37:48.280]   aspect of audio conferencing.
[00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:52.640]   So there's two ways you can go to get quality audio in a larger space.
[00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:55.560]   You go to get a ProAV system.
[00:37:55.560 --> 00:38:00.520]   Multiple components, multiple microphones, speakers installed in the ceiling, spread
[00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:01.520]   across the table.
[00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:03.640]   Of course, they all have to have cables.
[00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:07.480]   You got to have technicians come in not just to install it, but to calibrate the system
[00:38:07.480 --> 00:38:12.520]   and sometimes recalibrate it, it'll take days to install and cost tens of thousands of
[00:38:12.520 --> 00:38:17.320]   dollars per room for the purchase and the installation.
[00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:19.040]   Or then there's a better way.
[00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:20.840]   Nureva audio.
[00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:27.560]   Exceptional audio for rooms as up to, well, 25 to 25 feet with one integrated microphone
[00:38:27.560 --> 00:38:31.720]   and speaker bar, two bars, 30 by 50 feet.
[00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:33.520]   You don't have to bring somebody into install it.
[00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:35.160]   It's a DIY project.
[00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:38.960]   If you can mount a sound bar, you can put up a Nureva system.
[00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:43.760]   It'll take you 30 minutes to install each device in the wall, two screws, one cable.
[00:38:43.760 --> 00:38:46.240]   Of course, a fraction of the price of AV systems.
[00:38:46.240 --> 00:38:47.640]   No calibration.
[00:38:47.640 --> 00:38:50.720]   And your users can act completely naturally.
[00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:52.080]   They can face any way.
[00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:53.320]   They can socially distance.
[00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:58.760]   They can do what makes them comfortable, but you still get great audio.
[00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:02.360]   And it really comes down to Nureva's microphone mist technology.
[00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:08.760]   Instead of using expensive, beam forming microphones where the person, the caller, or
[00:39:08.760 --> 00:39:11.600]   the talker has to stay right in that one spot.
[00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:12.600]   You can't turn.
[00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:13.600]   You can't face away.
[00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:16.160]   And of course, if you rearrange the room, you have to recalibrate.
[00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:18.000]   Not Nureva's microphone mist technology.
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:22.760]   This is where software, it really is computational audio, really makes a difference.
[00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:26.840]   True full room coverage, no matter where you move, no matter which way you face, it's like
[00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:31.320]   putting thousands of microphones in the room so that everybody can be heard.
[00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:37.000]   And it continuously auto-calibrates without any intervention on your part.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:40.160]   Their microphone mist technology is patented.
[00:39:40.160 --> 00:39:41.600]   It's incredible.
[00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:43.400]   It's a no touch design.
[00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:44.920]   You don't have to wipe down microphones.
[00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:45.920]   It's really incredible.
[00:39:45.920 --> 00:39:51.920]   Nureva Console is a simple, intuitive platform that lets you easily monitor, manage, adjust,
[00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:54.600]   and scale your fleet of systems from anywhere.
[00:39:54.600 --> 00:39:56.320]   No training required.
[00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:58.800]   The question is, which approach will you choose?
[00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:01.960]   One more, Nureva.com/twit.
[00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:08.960]   That's N-U-R-E-V-A dot com slash twit perfect for the conference room in this new era,
[00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:10.600]   this new socially distanced era.
[00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:12.320]   Nureva dot com slash twit.
[00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:14.840]   Thank you, Nureva, for your support.
[00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:22.200]   Thank you for supporting this week in Google by going to that special address, Nureva.com/twit.
[00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:26.320]   Not twig, but twit, T-W-I-T.
[00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:28.440]   The ignobel prizes are out.
[00:40:28.440 --> 00:40:31.720]   You know about the ignobel prizes, right?
[00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:38.400]   Every year, it's the 31st annual ignobel prize was last week.
[00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:41.880]   Each winner, a real scientific project.
[00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:46.560]   Let us say, just to start off with, I love it too.
[00:40:46.560 --> 00:40:50.760]   Some of these projects do have a purpose in life and we make fun of science these days.
[00:40:50.760 --> 00:40:54.680]   We should probably, shouldn't be making, I put on the list, so I'm okay with this, but
[00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:58.080]   be careful making too much fun of science since it's science is going to save our damn
[00:40:58.080 --> 00:40:59.080]   lives.
[00:40:59.080 --> 00:41:00.360]   Having said that, let's have a good laugh.
[00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:02.080]   Look, we all love science here.
[00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:03.640]   Everybody's like, it's a tech.
[00:41:03.640 --> 00:41:06.720]   Look, if you're into technology, you have to love science.
[00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:09.640]   Technology is just science applied.
[00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:11.480]   You can't have one without the other.
[00:41:11.480 --> 00:41:16.600]   So we're, nobody's knocking science here, but sometimes for various reasons, people
[00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:20.600]   study interesting things like for the biology prize.
[00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:27.880]   And this is, this goes to Sweden for analyzing variations in, purring, chirping, chattering,
[00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:34.000]   trilling, twiddling, murmuring, meowing, moaning, squeaking, hissing, yowling, howling, growling
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   and other modes of cat, human communication.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:43.360]   The paper, well, we do want to understand what our cats are saying.
[00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:45.000]   I think it's something I get.
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   I get it.
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   Perfectly.
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:53.160]   The science of phonetic 2011 speech, music and hearing, KTH Stockholm, a comparative acoustic
[00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:56.800]   analysis of purring in four cats.
[00:41:56.800 --> 00:42:01.260]   And then they succeeded it with the phonetic pilot study of vocalizations in three cats,
[00:42:01.260 --> 00:42:02.260]   the following year.
[00:42:02.260 --> 00:42:07.400]   In 2013, they did the phonetic pilot, pilot study of chirp, chatter, tweet and twiddle
[00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:12.600]   in three domestic cats in, in 2014.
[00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:15.520]   They really, they really, this is their life work.
[00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:17.280]   I don't, I don't want to knock it.
[00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:22.520]   A study of human perception in intonation in domestic cat meows.
[00:42:22.520 --> 00:42:29.880]   And of course, I think the reason Suzanne Schutz just took this award away, her seminal
[00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:37.720]   work in 2016, Melody in human cat communications, which she calls meowzick.
[00:42:37.720 --> 00:42:40.320]   Oh, dear.
[00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:41.320]   Okay.
[00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:45.040]   You can't read that with a straight face.
[00:42:45.040 --> 00:42:46.040]   You can't.
[00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:53.400]   No, in the ecology prize, it goes to Spain and Iran for a joint study using genetic analysis
[00:42:53.400 --> 00:42:59.900]   to identify the different species of bacteria that reside in wads of discarded chewing gum
[00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:01.760]   stuck on pavements.
[00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:05.520]   And here's where they really get the award in various countries.
[00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:07.320]   They were not international in school.
[00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:10.440]   They were not to stop with just one country.
[00:43:10.440 --> 00:43:12.640]   They want to do various countries.
[00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:19.880]   Chemistry prize goes to a large number of researchers all over, all over the world.
[00:43:19.880 --> 00:43:23.000]   Germany, UK, New Zealand, Greece, Cyprus and Austria.
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:26.920]   This was really an amazing study.
[00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:34.960]   They tested chemically analyzed, in fact, the air inside movie theaters to test whether
[00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:42.600]   the odors produced by an audience could reliably indicate the level of violence, sex, anti-social
[00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:48.000]   behavior, drug use and bad language in the movie that audience is watching.
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   They call it cinema data mining.
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:59.360]   The smell of fear.
[00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:05.200]   And actually what they're hoping because they're ambitious scientists, they're hoping that
[00:44:05.200 --> 00:44:12.560]   they can use the analysis of human volatile organic compounds as a tool for age classification
[00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:13.920]   of films.
[00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:18.360]   This film smells too adult for you.
[00:44:18.360 --> 00:44:21.840]   Wait, what?
[00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:22.840]   It's just the research.
[00:44:22.840 --> 00:44:26.760]   I can only go with the research.
[00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:27.760]   Economics prize.
[00:44:27.760 --> 00:44:28.760]   Go ahead.
[00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:29.760]   This one I like.
[00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:30.760]   I'm just not going.
[00:44:30.760 --> 00:44:31.760]   There's nothing to say.
[00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:32.760]   Nothing to say.
[00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:35.120]   It's just it's good work.
[00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:37.880]   In the economics prize, I think this might be too intuitive.
[00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:38.880]   Right, Jeff?
[00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:39.880]   I like to.
[00:44:39.880 --> 00:44:41.680]   I like to know you got to take.
[00:44:41.680 --> 00:44:44.720]   You know, there aren't really filter bubbles when you do the research to discover this.
[00:44:44.720 --> 00:44:45.720]   You got to do the research.
[00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:46.720]   You have this presumption.
[00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:49.920]   You have this impression, but it's worth doing the research to see whether it's true
[00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:50.920]   or not.
[00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:58.960]   The economics prize goes to Pavlo Blavatoski for his research in discovering that the obesity
[00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:09.280]   of a country's politicians may be a good indicator of that country's corruption.
[00:45:09.280 --> 00:45:10.280]   Fat politicians.
[00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:14.160]   You got to hypothesis.
[00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:15.160]   You got to test it.
[00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:18.160]   You can't just say, well, that's obvious.
[00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:23.000]   Can sex improve nasal function and exploration of the link?
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:24.760]   Well, they can get rid of my CPAP.
[00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:30.960]   They're trying to demonstrate that sexual orgasms can be as effective as decongestant
[00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:34.120]   medicines at improving breathing.
[00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:35.920]   I'd like to participate.
[00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:38.520]   I don't want to see that research though.
[00:45:38.520 --> 00:45:41.960]   I'd like to volunteer.
[00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:43.520]   No.
[00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:52.160]   No, the Ig Nobel Peace Prize, of course, we keep it right here at home in the US of A.
[00:45:52.160 --> 00:45:54.800]   And I think rightly so.
[00:45:54.800 --> 00:46:01.480]   This very important research published in the integrative organismal biology, volume
[00:46:01.480 --> 00:46:09.000]   two, number one for 2020, Ethan Bessaras, Steven, Nalaway and David Carrier testing the
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:16.080]   hypothesis that humans evolved beards to protect themselves from punches to the face.
[00:46:16.080 --> 00:46:20.080]   Yeah, you got a problem with that.
[00:46:20.080 --> 00:46:21.080]   Huh?
[00:46:21.080 --> 00:46:23.160]   Actually, you know how scientists are.
[00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:24.160]   They like to write.
[00:46:24.160 --> 00:46:25.640]   Exactly why I grew my beard up.
[00:46:25.640 --> 00:46:28.400]   They'd like to write it in fancy, fancy.
[00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:35.760]   So the title really is impact protection potential of mammalian hair testing the pugilism hypothesis
[00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:38.760]   for the evolution of human facial hair.
[00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:40.040]   We still don't know, by the way.
[00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:47.040]   We don't know why hair on the face, but not hair on the biceps or hands or something
[00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:48.040]   else.
[00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:49.040]   I don't know.
[00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:50.040]   You have hair everywhere.
[00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:51.040]   I don't know.
[00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:52.040]   Palms.
[00:46:52.040 --> 00:46:53.040]   Palms.
[00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:54.040]   Thank you.
[00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:55.040]   There you go.
[00:46:55.040 --> 00:46:56.040]   That's one place, right?
[00:46:56.040 --> 00:46:57.040]   No hair.
[00:46:57.040 --> 00:46:58.040]   Depends.
[00:46:58.040 --> 00:47:05.080]   Depends for research on why pedestrians do not constantly collide with other pedestrians.
[00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:11.560]   Kinetics price for connecting experiments conversely on why pedestrians do sometimes
[00:47:11.560 --> 00:47:13.880]   collide with other pedestrians.
[00:47:13.880 --> 00:47:16.120]   Just kind of sometimes you get these intersections.
[00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:17.120]   Symmetries.
[00:47:17.120 --> 00:47:20.080]   One answer is tourists in New York by the way.
[00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:22.720]   Completely different teams.
[00:47:22.720 --> 00:47:23.720]   Completely different teams.
[00:47:23.720 --> 00:47:24.720]   I don't know.
[00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:25.720]   It's weird that they both.
[00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:26.720]   That's how science works.
[00:47:26.720 --> 00:47:32.680]   The entomology prize.
[00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:33.760]   This is useful.
[00:47:33.760 --> 00:47:34.760]   This is useful.
[00:47:34.760 --> 00:47:35.760]   Bugs.
[00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:38.680]   New method of cockroach control on submarines.
[00:47:38.680 --> 00:47:40.480]   Gotta gotta have it.
[00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:41.480]   Yeah.
[00:47:41.480 --> 00:47:42.480]   Gotta have it.
[00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:45.880]   Dude, as someone who lived in Texas, that is applicable.
[00:47:45.880 --> 00:47:49.680]   Probably there too.
[00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:51.280]   Roaches were a real issue.
[00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:56.680]   Now if you read the title of this scientific paper, you may be confused about it's in
[00:47:56.680 --> 00:47:57.680]   import.
[00:47:57.680 --> 00:48:01.880]   It's from the Journal of Wildlife Diseases.
[00:48:01.880 --> 00:48:03.680]   Too many scientists to name them all.
[00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:08.800]   But the pulmonary and metabolic effects of suspension by the feet compared with lateral
[00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:16.520]   recumbency in immobilized black rhinoceroses, diceros bicornis, captured by aerial darting.
[00:48:16.520 --> 00:48:21.040]   And what they're trying to figure out is is it safer to transport an airborne rhinoceros
[00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:23.040]   upright or upside down?
[00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:26.040]   I'm gonna say is the only side or is it?
[00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:29.680]   Upset lateral recumbency versus suspension.
[00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:31.560]   Upset down is the right way?
[00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:32.560]   Suspension by the feet.
[00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:33.560]   Well, yes.
[00:48:33.560 --> 00:48:34.560]   Yes.
[00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:35.560]   That's what we're talking about.
[00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:36.560]   What was the conclusion of this paper?
[00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:38.400]   No, I've gotta know, right?
[00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:41.040]   Let's dig into the abstract.
[00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:46.320]   Aerial translocation of captured black rhinoceroses has been accomplished by suspending them by
[00:48:46.320 --> 00:48:47.800]   their feet.
[00:48:47.800 --> 00:48:52.440]   We expected this posture would compromise respiratory gas exchange more than would
[00:48:52.440 --> 00:48:59.960]   lateral recumbency.
[00:48:59.960 --> 00:49:00.960]   All I can see.
[00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:01.960]   Black rhinoceros.
[00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:04.240]   Hey boss, how was your lateral recumbency these days?
[00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:10.200]   I got I've been laterally recumbent for suspension by the feet for 10 minutes.
[00:49:10.200 --> 00:49:14.800]   Did not impair pulmonary function more than did lateral recumbency.
[00:49:14.800 --> 00:49:17.440]   And apparently there they are.
[00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:21.840]   Augmented gas exchange to a small degree relative to lateral recumbency.
[00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:23.800]   So they parted?
[00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:26.320]   Black rhinoceros is immobilized.
[00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:29.440]   We're not as hypermetabolic as we're white rhinoceros.
[00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:33.320]   See again, they played the race card.
[00:49:33.320 --> 00:49:35.560]   I'm very disappointed.
[00:49:35.560 --> 00:49:37.120]   Very disappointed.
[00:49:37.120 --> 00:49:42.240]   Anyway, the Nobel Prize is ladies and gentlemen.
[00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:45.920]   Congratulations to all our winners.
[00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:46.920]   Into it.
[00:49:46.920 --> 00:49:50.720]   I gotta go back to the cat at the beginning.
[00:49:50.720 --> 00:49:54.760]   You know, they've been we said they've been working on it for like 15 years.
[00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:57.120]   Yeah, that's what's amazing.
[00:49:57.120 --> 00:50:04.640]   That's that's impressive considering cats don't give a hood about anybody or anything.
[00:50:04.640 --> 00:50:10.400]   And yet they were able to research per and tweeting and all of that good stuff.
[00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:14.000]   You know, I can see why it took 14, 15 years.
[00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:18.400]   It's interesting because they started with four cats and then it was three cats.
[00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:22.080]   I don't know if the cat dropped out.
[00:50:22.080 --> 00:50:24.880]   Maybe it was qualified for marijuana use.
[00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:25.880]   I don't know.
[00:50:25.880 --> 00:50:28.040]   I'm pretty sure that cat was like, I got better.
[00:50:28.040 --> 00:50:31.200]   I'm not doing that typical cat.
[00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:36.720]   Into it is buying Mailchimp, the mailing list company.
[00:50:36.720 --> 00:50:38.440]   Everybody's got to have a newsletter now.
[00:50:38.440 --> 00:50:41.200]   It's a constitutional amendment that you required to have a newsletter.
[00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:45.120]   Let me tell you, this is apparently a very lucrative field.
[00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:49.680]   $12 billion for Mailchimp, $12 billion.
[00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:53.160]   I pay Mailchimp.
[00:50:53.160 --> 00:50:55.160]   Is that how you use for your newsletter?
[00:50:55.160 --> 00:50:58.360]   It is, but it's so much more than newsletters now.
[00:50:58.360 --> 00:51:02.920]   It's more like a CRM kind of for probably why it wants it, right?
[00:51:02.920 --> 00:51:03.920]   Yep, right.
[00:51:03.920 --> 00:51:12.360]   So into it said they have into it said Mailchimp has the data, I believe in in a statement
[00:51:12.360 --> 00:51:16.280]   it's like they have the data, we have all this other information, why not just put it
[00:51:16.280 --> 00:51:17.840]   all together?
[00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:20.680]   That's always scary when they say it's about that.
[00:51:20.680 --> 00:51:21.680]   They said it openly.
[00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:22.960]   Yeah, they did.
[00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:27.840]   This is into it CEO Sassan Ghudzari.
[00:51:27.840 --> 00:51:30.280]   Mailchimp has quote, "A lot of customer data.
[00:51:30.280 --> 00:51:32.000]   We have all the purchase data.
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:36.160]   The magic is putting these two together."
[00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:37.160]   It is true.
[00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:42.320]   So like a lot of the Mailchimp back end is dedicated to people who want to send email
[00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:44.280]   emails to sell you stuff.
[00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:49.800]   So like I don't obviously use it that way, but if I send you an email with Stacy's pottery
[00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:55.440]   and I'm featuring like three pots, I can see like what people click on.
[00:51:55.440 --> 00:52:00.240]   I can see actually who clicks on what and now if you actually have the purchase data
[00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:07.760]   on their side, you can actually say Leo bought this particular pot and I can pull.
[00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:09.520]   I mean, that's actually pretty interesting.
[00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:11.080]   I won't lie.
[00:52:11.080 --> 00:52:12.080]   It's that close in the loop.
[00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:15.520]   You know how much Ant Pro loves TikTok musicals and I'm sure that's why.
[00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:16.520]   You put this on here.
[00:52:16.520 --> 00:52:17.520]   Just for him.
[00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:18.520]   He kidding me?
[00:52:18.520 --> 00:52:19.520]   Just for him.
[00:52:19.520 --> 00:52:25.800]   When I say I could be brown, I could be blue, I could be violet sky, I could be hurtful,
[00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:29.200]   I could be purple, I could be anything you like.
[00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:30.200]   What comes to mind?
[00:52:30.200 --> 00:52:31.200]   I don't know.
[00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:33.560]   Wizard of Oz?
[00:52:33.560 --> 00:52:34.560]   Nothing.
[00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:35.560]   It's the grace.
[00:52:35.560 --> 00:52:37.040]   I know why it's- I could be blue.
[00:52:37.040 --> 00:52:38.040]   I could be violet.
[00:52:38.040 --> 00:52:39.120]   Is this a grace telling?
[00:52:39.120 --> 00:52:40.640]   It's a, yeah, I could be.
[00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:42.520]   Is this from a movie, a Grace Kelly movie?
[00:52:42.520 --> 00:52:43.680]   I don't know where it's from.
[00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:45.240]   I just know it's all over it.
[00:52:45.240 --> 00:52:47.600]   Is this- Is this the end-hole or something other?
[00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:48.600]   It sounds like yeah.
[00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:49.600]   It's not a data.
[00:52:49.600 --> 00:52:54.040]   People do, they record, one person can record all the parts or two people can record all
[00:52:54.040 --> 00:52:58.680]   the parts and so it's quite popular.
[00:52:58.680 --> 00:53:02.280]   You can go down below the one you're going to show and show why it's popular.
[00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:03.280]   I'll show you.
[00:53:03.280 --> 00:53:04.280]   I'll show the girls.
[00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:05.280]   Oh, collaborative.
[00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:06.280]   This is the key.
[00:53:06.280 --> 00:53:07.280]   Yeah, here's some girls.
[00:53:07.280 --> 00:53:09.720]   This is called the Grace Kelly singing challenge.
[00:53:09.720 --> 00:53:11.120]   I could be blue.
[00:53:11.120 --> 00:53:13.040]   I could be violet sky.
[00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:14.040]   I could be hurtful.
[00:53:14.040 --> 00:53:15.040]   I could be purple.
[00:53:15.040 --> 00:53:16.800]   I could be anything you like.
[00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:17.800]   I could be brown.
[00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:18.800]   I could be blue.
[00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:20.640]   I could be violet sky.
[00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:21.640]   I could be hurtful.
[00:53:21.640 --> 00:53:22.640]   I could be purple.
[00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:23.640]   I could be anything you like.
[00:53:23.640 --> 00:53:24.640]   It's like a round.
[00:53:24.640 --> 00:53:25.640]   Oh, yeah.
[00:53:25.640 --> 00:53:26.640]   I could be blue.
[00:53:26.640 --> 00:53:27.640]   I could be violet.
[00:53:27.640 --> 00:53:29.200]   But it can just be one person singing.
[00:53:29.200 --> 00:53:34.120]   I like it that they have this in a, in a diagram mobile app.
[00:53:34.120 --> 00:53:35.120]   It's cool.
[00:53:35.120 --> 00:53:36.120]   They are- I know.
[00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:37.120]   Isn't that great?
[00:53:37.120 --> 00:53:42.120]   I'm a sicktock fan.
[00:53:42.120 --> 00:53:48.120]   My son now has 200,000 plus followers and millions of views on every video.
[00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:49.120]   So I'm a believer.
[00:53:49.120 --> 00:53:52.120]   So anyway, they're- I'm a sucker for these.
[00:53:52.120 --> 00:53:54.120]   They're all pretty to listen to.
[00:53:54.120 --> 00:53:55.120]   I love them.
[00:53:55.120 --> 00:53:56.120]   I love the singing ones.
[00:53:56.120 --> 00:53:59.120]   So apparently I didn't know this, but Ryan Reynolds, who is of course-
[00:53:59.120 --> 00:54:00.120]   Oh, yeah.
[00:54:00.120 --> 00:54:01.120]   This happened yesterday.
[00:54:01.120 --> 00:54:02.120]   The owner of Mint Mobile.
[00:54:02.120 --> 00:54:03.120]   Don't go get away with this.
[00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:04.120]   Oh, boy.
[00:54:04.120 --> 00:54:05.120]   And Will Ferrell are working together in a movie called A Christmas Carol.
[00:54:05.120 --> 00:54:08.280]   And Ryan Reynolds decided, you know, as long as he's got nothing to do, because this is
[00:54:08.280 --> 00:54:13.320]   the problem, frankly, being on a movie set, you got a lot of free time in between takes.
[00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:15.560]   So he thought he tried it himself.
[00:54:15.560 --> 00:54:16.960]   Let's- I could be brown.
[00:54:16.960 --> 00:54:17.960]   I could be blue.
[00:54:17.960 --> 00:54:19.800]   I could be violet sky.
[00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:20.800]   I could be hurtful.
[00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:21.800]   I could be purple.
[00:54:21.800 --> 00:54:23.460]   I could be anything you like.
[00:54:23.460 --> 00:54:24.460]   I could be brown.
[00:54:24.460 --> 00:54:25.460]   I could be blue.
[00:54:25.460 --> 00:54:26.460]   I could be white.
[00:54:26.460 --> 00:54:27.460]   I could be blue.
[00:54:27.460 --> 00:54:28.460]   I could be with the harmony.
[00:54:28.460 --> 00:54:29.460]   I could be hurtful.
[00:54:29.460 --> 00:54:30.460]   I could be purple.
[00:54:30.460 --> 00:54:31.460]   You layer it on.
[00:54:31.460 --> 00:54:32.460]   No, I- No, I- No, I- I can hit it.
[00:54:32.460 --> 00:54:33.460]   I could be blue.
[00:54:33.460 --> 00:54:34.460]   I could be violet sky.
[00:54:34.460 --> 00:54:35.460]   I could be hurtful.
[00:54:35.460 --> 00:54:36.460]   It's pretty good.
[00:54:36.460 --> 00:54:37.460]   He's a good singer.
[00:54:37.460 --> 00:54:38.460]   I could be anything you like.
[00:54:38.460 --> 00:54:39.460]   I could be brown.
[00:54:39.460 --> 00:54:40.460]   I could be blue.
[00:54:40.460 --> 00:54:41.460]   I could be violet sky.
[00:54:41.460 --> 00:54:42.460]   I could be purple.
[00:54:42.460 --> 00:54:43.460]   I could be anything you like.
[00:54:43.460 --> 00:54:44.460]   I could be brown.
[00:54:44.460 --> 00:54:45.460]   I could be blue.
[00:54:45.460 --> 00:54:46.460]   I could be blue.
[00:54:46.460 --> 00:54:47.460]   I could be blue.
[00:54:47.460 --> 00:54:48.460]   Will Ferrell walks in.
[00:54:48.460 --> 00:54:49.460]   I could be blue.
[00:54:49.460 --> 00:54:50.460]   I could be purple.
[00:54:50.460 --> 00:54:51.460]   I could be anything you like.
[00:54:51.460 --> 00:54:52.460]   I could be brown.
[00:54:52.460 --> 00:54:53.460]   I could be blue.
[00:54:53.460 --> 00:54:54.460]   I could be blue.
[00:54:54.460 --> 00:54:55.460]   I could be violet sky.
[00:54:55.460 --> 00:54:56.460]   I could be purple.
[00:54:56.460 --> 00:54:57.460]   I could be purple.
[00:54:57.460 --> 00:54:58.460]   I could be anything you like.
[00:54:58.460 --> 00:54:59.460]   I could be brown.
[00:54:59.460 --> 00:55:00.460]   I could be blue.
[00:55:00.460 --> 00:55:01.460]   I could be blue.
[00:55:01.460 --> 00:55:02.460]   I could be violet sky.
[00:55:02.460 --> 00:55:03.460]   I could be purple.
[00:55:03.460 --> 00:55:08.180]   for a good apparently. It is a musical. So I guess they can both sing. Oh, that fath
[00:55:08.180 --> 00:55:15.880]   going to start like a musical. That would be, no, no, negative serve. That was good,
[00:55:15.880 --> 00:55:19.580]   though. I give credit where credit is dude, that to be able to do this inside of a mobile
[00:55:19.580 --> 00:55:25.780]   app is it we're going to make him a tiktokker sooner or later. That's why tiktok is so amazing
[00:55:25.780 --> 00:55:31.400]   because it enables that kind of collaboration and remixing and it's just it's it's it's
[00:55:31.400 --> 00:55:38.980]   a new level of of content creation. Yeah, so wait, I've got a better for you. And I will
[00:55:38.980 --> 00:55:43.940]   say, no, well, I was going to say because I thought of aunt this week, actually, I realized
[00:55:43.940 --> 00:55:48.860]   I finally learned how to do makeup. And I everyone was like, Oh, just what's your
[00:55:48.860 --> 00:55:55.660]   usual tutorial? I was just going to say Stacy, you look really good today. Oh, thank you.
[00:55:55.660 --> 00:55:59.540]   I did not I didn't I don't have contour, but I finally learned how to do. I was just going
[00:55:59.540 --> 00:56:06.280]   to say I didn't like no, I noticed right away. I wanted to be you know, because I know people
[00:56:06.280 --> 00:56:12.060]   you don't say nobody likes it personal, but given that you've raised this point, whatever
[00:56:12.060 --> 00:56:20.560]   you're doing, it's working. Well, I had an event earlier. So that's okay. But you two
[00:56:20.560 --> 00:56:25.240]   gave people infinite time. So their makeup tutorials were killer. I was like, I do not
[00:56:25.240 --> 00:56:30.920]   watch someone for 10 minutes. But for like a minute, people can get everything I mean.
[00:56:30.920 --> 00:56:36.020]   And so yeah, I'm like screw YouTube TikToks where it's well. And as we mentioned last
[00:56:36.020 --> 00:56:41.640]   week, TikTok has more viewing now more view. People spend more time watching TikToks than
[00:56:41.640 --> 00:56:46.400]   they do YouTube videos. And that's probably why short attention span. I know I talked
[00:56:46.400 --> 00:56:51.360]   to my son a lot about this because he's really become the TikTok master. He's now my teacher
[00:56:51.360 --> 00:56:57.740]   on tick tock quarter of a million followers and growing fast. You can go up to three
[00:56:57.740 --> 00:57:02.080]   minutes. But he's found that it's better if they're shorter. So by the way, today he
[00:57:02.080 --> 00:57:08.120]   posted a video today, 4.6 million views so far. This one, this one we showed. I thought
[00:57:08.120 --> 00:57:11.680]   we showed this one last week. I would like to eat that. This is he's one of the things
[00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:17.520]   he does. This is big on sound effects.
[00:57:17.520 --> 00:57:22.680]   Holy m a s m r whatever you want to call it. He's the master. The other thing he does
[00:57:22.680 --> 00:57:27.680]   and I talked about this is it's not clear when it's looping. So people watch it over
[00:57:27.680 --> 00:57:32.040]   and over and over and over. Because he's not sure he got to the end. And he's like a high
[00:57:32.040 --> 00:57:38.440]   quality gift. He does that very consciously. How long does it take to edit half a day?
[00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:44.680]   So here's here's here's his most recent. This is this is a duck sandwich. It's pretty
[00:57:44.680 --> 00:57:51.680]   good. Nice choice of music for this one. I know I told him that I said he gets paid
[00:57:51.680 --> 00:57:57.080]   off. I did what the audience. Although I've heard it I think a couple times on some of
[00:57:57.080 --> 00:58:01.440]   my videos. So maybe it's I asked him how he figured out what music places does this
[00:58:01.440 --> 00:58:07.400]   spotify a lot and try to find something that works with the thing. Plus it's the real sound
[00:58:07.400 --> 00:58:15.320]   to the real sound is what's what's key. Yeah. So yeah, 8 million views, 7 and a half million
[00:58:15.320 --> 00:58:20.200]   views, 3 and a half. So I was asking you before and we got we got to interrupt ourselves.
[00:58:20.200 --> 00:58:29.880]   How do you turn that into a living? I keep asking. I saw not to be that dad because you
[00:58:29.880 --> 00:58:34.960]   know when when I was a well when his mom and I got married his his mom's brother said
[00:58:34.960 --> 00:58:44.160]   don't marry a DJ those guys. They're not going anywhere. Just a subtle nudge. Yeah. So but
[00:58:44.160 --> 00:58:48.040]   that's true and I realized it was doing the same thing with him. Oh come on you know don't
[00:58:48.040 --> 00:58:53.120]   that's not real media that's but it is real me. This is modern. Yeah. He could get invited
[00:58:53.120 --> 00:58:58.160]   to the Met Gala next year. I wouldn't be sure at all and I hope you wear that sweatshirt
[00:58:58.160 --> 00:59:03.840]   and sunglasses and the cheesy porn stash which all of which we try to discourage him from
[00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:11.360]   wearing. My mom 88 year old mom says don't wear a hat Henry you're so cute. Why are you
[00:59:11.360 --> 00:59:18.160]   wearing a hat? But I just tell her mom it's a different generation you know. Yes. So but
[00:59:18.160 --> 00:59:22.160]   I you know we worked out this morning together. I'm always querying him you know what's so
[00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:26.880]   what are you learning and he's really paying close attention to the feedback that he gets
[00:59:26.880 --> 00:59:33.520]   both from comments but also views and is tuning it slowly closer and closer to and you can see
[00:59:33.520 --> 00:59:37.760]   them it makes a difference. Yes. It really does. What kind of metrics do they give them besides
[00:59:37.760 --> 00:59:42.320]   just views? Is there anything else? I'll ask him I don't know. Oh so you asked how do you make
[00:59:42.320 --> 00:59:47.840]   money so there's a couple ways to make money. Yeah. TikTok ads are not inter interstitial they're
[00:59:47.840 --> 00:59:53.600]   not in your video right. So unlike YouTube you don't have pre-roll post-row mid-roll so there's
[00:59:53.600 --> 00:59:58.960]   nothing a tie to your video so you don't get any of that ad revenue. You know it's like Instagram
[00:59:58.960 --> 01:00:04.880]   it's every few videos there's an ad. Now I see a lot more big brands on TikTok so I obviously
[01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:10.560]   TikTok is doing suddenly very very very well but they do have a hundred million-dollar creators
[01:00:10.560 --> 01:00:17.040]   fund so that gets parceled out but you know he's got four million views maybe six hundred bucks
[01:00:17.040 --> 01:00:22.080]   so it's not it's not a big one. Wow. So what most of that's not like YouTube money.
[01:00:22.080 --> 01:00:26.560]   No yeah but what TikTok does because they know they're not sharing revenue with you
[01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:31.920]   they allow you to have ads so you can sell your own ads in there and the CPMs are something
[01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:37.360]   something like five bucks which if you have seven million views is seven thousand dollars.
[01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:45.920]   Nice. Or is that right Noah's? Thirty thirty three I don't know. Five dollars per thousand.
[01:00:45.920 --> 01:00:51.040]   Chat room. Seven million. That's seven thousand. Thirty five thousand dollars. That's a lot of money.
[01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:57.120]   Is that right? Could that be right? Thirty five thousand dollars. So let's go and save us please.
[01:00:57.120 --> 01:01:01.280]   It's a lot of money. They see. Can you do it? No I just did it. That's right. I was
[01:01:01.280 --> 01:01:05.680]   I was signing up for the Pixel Super Fans Club because I'm like we're gonna talk about Google
[01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:13.280]   eventually. Yeah. Hold on. That's right. Math. So Scooter actually saying that the US TikTok
[01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:18.960]   creator fund is actually now they plan to spend 200 million over the next 12 months
[01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:24.480]   August to August 2020 to 2021 and will be upwards of a billion in the next three years
[01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:29.360]   and more than double that globally they have to because otherwise creators that's killed fine.
[01:01:29.360 --> 01:01:34.000]   You got to share that money back or creators go yeah we'll go somewhere else and he told me
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:40.720]   YouTube shorts is doing this too. So nevertheless is he cross posting it to anywhere other than
[01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:45.280]   he puts it on Instagram as well and I told him do YouTube shorts why not what's wrong why would
[01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:51.200]   not why not. I don't know if he's gonna why don't but he the next step for him would be going out
[01:01:51.200 --> 01:01:59.360]   selling ads or signing a deal with like having a knife company or a chopping block company or
[01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:05.680]   pan company he's gonna be a Sir La Tabla exactly he just goes into cooking. Exactly.
[01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:12.400]   He he's gonna be a guest poster on the taste made instagram this week.
[01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:17.360]   Taste made big that's a big instagram that's branding there yeah yeah so I think
[01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:23.840]   next year we'll see what I've been saying about my son yeah don't be a TikTok star they don't make
[01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:29.360]   any money I might be wrong I think I think it's it's not influencers he's a content creator and
[01:02:29.360 --> 01:02:35.760]   actually my feeling is even if he doesn't make money on TikTok he's the skills he's getting are
[01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:42.320]   useful and we'll get him you know funny. Hey that's the one thing I can say about TikTok is
[01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:49.920]   the way it puts constraints on the content creator. It's good. Okay I need to create content that is
[01:02:49.920 --> 01:02:56.320]   60 seconds long that is going to make people want to stop to click on it first of all and then
[01:02:56.320 --> 01:03:01.040]   make them want to watch it all the way through for 60 seconds and then make them want to say hey
[01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:06.720]   did you see this let me show this to you that's this pretty damn challenging and not everybody can
[01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:13.360]   do that yeah it's I am big pentameter it is yeah right is the goodness of strength of poetry and
[01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:20.000]   art that constraints be here yeah yeah so true and it also means this is true of youtube and
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:24.160]   twitter and everything else if you're gonna be a content creator you have to work your ass off
[01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:31.120]   you have to post every day you cannot stop it's a content machine go ahead I'm sorry Stacy
[01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:35.200]   no I was just gonna say Jeff how does this relate back to Gutenberg
[01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:53.760]   actually to one um Shakespeare found that verse sold better than Rose interesting and so
[01:03:53.760 --> 01:04:00.160]   Shakespeare was the first major um the first um playwright who ended a major playwright who ended
[01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:07.600]   up with a real market in printed planes so around the same time that montane invented the um essay
[01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:15.520]   and sevante's the modern novel uh and and a guy named Johan Corollis the newspaper all around 1600
[01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:21.360]   Shakespeare proved the market for printed plays since you asked if you don't mind I'd like to take
[01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:30.400]   us back to the 21st century yeah I'm just teasing I love it I could go on I love Shakespeare
[01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:38.400]   um can we show the picture from inspiration for right now John the uh today the first all I
[01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:45.600]   didn't realize this there has never been an all civilian uh space flight into orbit this is the
[01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:50.160]   first all civilian mission orbit we've been talking about inspiration oh I'm supposed to
[01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:54.560]   watch that doc on Netflix you got a you got a little time after the show because they're launching in
[01:04:54.560 --> 01:05:01.520]   two hours uh as we record that'll be five around five o'clock pacific apm eastern this is the
[01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:08.640]   inspiration for crew this if you watch the documentary I think it's called countdown you really get
[01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:16.160]   inspired uh Jared Isaacman who was you know a startup guy when he was 16 years old he created
[01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:24.000]   uh a credit card payment company called shift for payments has become a billionaire in the years
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:30.720]   since in the 21 years since uh also has taken that money learned to fly commercial military
[01:05:30.720 --> 01:05:38.000]   aircraft he bought uh I think he bought a uh I think 40 fighter jets and has the private black
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:43.120]   diamond jet team they do air shows he's got six thousand hours in the air so he's an accomplished
[01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:48.400]   pilot he bought the flight I don't know what he spent but he bought the flight and he said we're
[01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:53.840]   gonna pot we're gonna uh my three other crew members because the SpaceX crew dragon holes
[01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:58.720]   well it can hold more but it has it can hold up to what eight seven or eight but there's gonna
[01:05:58.720 --> 01:06:07.360]   be four on it so he had a contest uh first he he said I want somebody from it's all to benefit
[01:06:07.360 --> 01:06:10.880]   St. Jude and they've raised by the way I think a hundred million dollars so far for St. Jude they've
[01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:16.400]   raised a lot of money uh who the what the what how much did the flight cost I don't know what
[01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:20.800]   he spent on the flight they don't mention that but it's about 50 million according to out of
[01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:29.360]   st. K in rrc okay 50 million um haley arsenal is going she's 29 years old she was treated for
[01:06:29.360 --> 01:06:34.880]   cancer as a child at st. Jude will be the first astronaut with a prosthetic she has a prosthetic
[01:06:34.880 --> 01:06:42.320]   femur and she's a physician's assistant at st. Jude's so she's going up with her then they had a
[01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:47.120]   contest you might have seen the super bowl ad where they they said uh if you contribute to
[01:06:47.120 --> 01:06:52.880]   st. Jude you're in the drawing to go to be in seat three and this guy chris sombroski wanted
[01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:57.920]   uh turns out he's worked in the air force he maintained intercontinental ballistic missiles
[01:06:57.920 --> 01:07:04.480]   and served in iraq so so he has some experience he he uh he has a bs and professional aeronautics
[01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:12.000]   he'll be going he's got a family two little kids and then the fourth uh crew member dr uh
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:19.200]   shan proctor is uh gonna be the i think the third or fourth african-american woman black woman to go
[01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:28.880]   into space uh and she again just kind of she won by submitting a video on twitter uh to show her
[01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:34.560]   entrepreneurial spirit she's 51 years old she's going so this is kind of an inspiring crew and
[01:07:34.560 --> 01:07:39.920]   they are they are now in the capsule so we were just showing the video uh there's a picture of them
[01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:45.360]   kind of bonding as a team they had to do astronaut training they all have a role they're flying the
[01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:50.400]   craft uh fortunately they have a very accomplished pilot in the front seat but there they are they've
[01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:55.680]   actually entered the space crystal how long are they gonna be up there three orbits um no i'm sorry three
[01:07:55.680 --> 01:08:00.400]   days which is how many orbits sixty orbits i don't know how many every 90 minutes they do
[01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:06.640]   in orbits so you can do the math so wait there's why wait wait wait wait wait wait um this is meant
[01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:12.320]   to be transport from here to the shuttle or back that's what that's how it was used last time and
[01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:19.120]   then it will also be used to go to the moon won't it or is but how do they like do things that humans
[01:08:19.120 --> 01:08:25.600]   need to do poo poo eat eat and poop and stuff in their suit there's actually if i can find
[01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:32.480]   a picture they can get up and move around once they uh once they get it or yeah i have a book on that
[01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:38.800]   i can actually answer that question but the book is downstairs it's it's a really good book do you
[01:08:38.800 --> 01:08:43.200]   remember just trying to remember anything at all just make up something and that would be okay no i
[01:08:43.200 --> 01:08:48.240]   i have the answer i'm not gonna make it up just stay tuned also just trying to grab a waffle i can
[01:08:48.240 --> 01:08:55.600]   name i can that's right that's right and you're on doer no no i have
[01:08:55.600 --> 01:09:02.560]   we moved and i don't know where my kids science books are there is that bathroom i will tell you
[01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:09.760]   because i remember now because there is a viewing dome once they get into orbit this the top of this
[01:09:09.760 --> 01:09:15.120]   capsule opens up and there's a clear viewing dome they can go into and the reason i know is because
[01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:19.280]   the viewing dome is next to the bathroom which is over here so there is actually a little space
[01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:23.520]   there's an actual bathroom i'll say okay all right yeah it's a fairly it's a fairly capacious
[01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:28.320]   and so food they just get they just get crackers astronaut food you get astronaut ice cream
[01:09:28.320 --> 01:09:37.680]   you get tang it's great prime rib prime rib in a bag you know it's a normal taco bell chicken
[01:09:37.680 --> 01:09:42.240]   sandwich is a regular space flight okay it's a regular space flight i want to know something
[01:09:42.240 --> 01:09:48.240]   super nerdy yeah i can name three of the african-american women astronauts who've actually i know may
[01:09:48.240 --> 01:09:54.240]   jemison is one right may jemison jon hagan bathom didn't know oh you know her at joe
[01:09:54.240 --> 01:10:04.240]   i do yeah nice and who's the other one mike uh steffy wilson oh i'm a press you can name them
[01:10:04.240 --> 01:10:10.880]   that's great i love astronauts me too i can name lots of female astronaut to be honest so
[01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:16.880]   have you been following this inspiration uh flight at all no i have other things i'm doing it's pretty
[01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:22.960]   exciting i would i would actually get your daughter watch the dog because the dock is great the dock
[01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:28.400]   will tee you up very nicely and this 29 year old she's on screen right now haly arson oh not my
[01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:36.720]   screen on the tv no you there we go is is absolutely great and adorable they're all great you really
[01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:42.080]   start to if you watch the dock which is only two episodes because they're going to have more episodes
[01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:47.680]   as the flight goes on uh it really gets you to get to know them and and get excited for them
[01:10:47.680 --> 01:10:54.640]   when she one of the things uh haly first of all the the video call that they each of them got
[01:10:54.640 --> 01:11:02.880]   saying by the way you're going into space is wonderful and uh haly wrote and said are we going
[01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:12.320]   to the moon where are we going where are we going in this no no no but it is real orbit in fact
[01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:17.680]   it's a little higher than this the uh space station so it's a fairly oh wow that's an actual
[01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:22.000]   book it's a high the book is called what it's like in space stories from astronauts who've been
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:27.680]   there it's designed for kids it's by ariel walton and i have a copy and it is amazing
[01:11:27.680 --> 01:11:33.040]   it answers all of your questions oh neat anyway i wanted to mention that because i'm i'm inspired
[01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:40.640]   by it um and i think it's really you know it's interesting because it's unlike jeff bezos's uh
[01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:47.120]   flight or or branson's flight branson this is these are is a real flight for one thing and there's
[01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:52.720]   these are civilians but they're trained and you know there they are in the the you know the
[01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:57.440]   where they centrifuge and everything they have to be highly trained for this but there are
[01:11:57.440 --> 01:12:03.440]   civilians and they're going to get to do it which is great um it's pretty friends and listener
[01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:08.560]   tanya wyman sent sent the message to me on saturday during footballs like hey make sure you watch
[01:12:08.560 --> 01:12:12.960]   this doc and i put it in the queue and i never got around to it well you can watch the launch
[01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:18.560]   tonight and then after uh after the launch you can you'll know a little bit more about uh are they
[01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:24.320]   going to try to accomplish any science they have some science they're going to do i don't remember
[01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:29.280]   what it was but they have some projects up there yeah you can't go to space without science projects
[01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:33.360]   so they can listen to cats in space how cats communicate with how kalies
[01:12:33.360 --> 01:12:38.880]   uh astronauts oh can you imagine a little cat with a little helmet that it's trying to get off the
[01:12:38.880 --> 01:12:50.720]   whole time cockroaches in space we could figure out what to do about cockroaches in space capsules
[01:12:50.720 --> 01:12:56.480]   this would be very useful so what do they survive they will they will always stay see they will
[01:12:56.480 --> 01:13:03.760]   oh i'm sure they will survive yeah i bet they're i bet there are already roaches in space i bet
[01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:10.560]   the space station has roaches i think that's a that's a good question that is a good i'm like
[01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:20.480]   i that's not in my book but i wish it were yeah think i think it's pretty yeah i think it's pretty clean
[01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:26.560]   uh international space station infested with muri mysterious bugs says the new york post well well
[01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:34.160]   wait a minute well let's take a break and uh more to come including the google
[01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:41.280]   changelog and just a little bit i showed it i brought to you by crowd strike this is a very
[01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:48.720]   interesting approach and i think very successful to fighting ransomware attacks using the knowledge
[01:13:48.720 --> 01:13:56.480]   of the crowd the problem is ransomware is never sleeps it's constantly moving constantly changing
[01:13:56.480 --> 01:14:02.400]   and of course constantly attacking you've seen the headlines we talk about it all the time
[01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:08.720]   ransomware attack after ransomware attack holding businesses hostage and if if you've got a business
[01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:13.280]   you you can i know i feel this way you can just like feel like it's only a matter of time
[01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:17.600]   before they come for you and then you're gonna have a very very tough decision
[01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:24.400]   pay the ransomware crooks millions of dollars or lose everything
[01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:32.320]   well there is a third option defeat your adversaries before the fight even starts i don't think anybody
[01:14:32.320 --> 01:14:38.240]   disagrees it is always a lot better not to get ransomware in the first place thank goodness
[01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:42.800]   there's crowd strike you're not alone in the battle against ransomware a secure future demands

[01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:26.560]   michael santones explained when i talked to them what makes crowd strike different and sets them
[01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:31.200]   apart from others i think what makes us unique is we've always tried to stay true to our mission
[01:16:31.200 --> 01:16:37.760]   to stop breaches and and it today it's never been more relevant uh when when crowd strike was founded
[01:16:37.760 --> 01:16:42.560]   a decade ago organizations and governments were being breached and technology that they were
[01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:48.800]   using was not protecting them so our goal was to build the fundamentals that organizations need
[01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:55.120]   to defend themselves and to stop breaches and that is everything that we focus on we focus on the
[01:16:55.120 --> 01:17:01.840]   customer we focus on stopping breaches and we make sure that we continually innovate to stay ahead
[01:17:01.840 --> 01:17:07.040]   of the threat for the benefit of our customers ten years later gartner magic quadrant named

[01:17:50.160 --> 01:17:56.720]   uh let's see i'm talking about amazon at one point all right yeah we haven't talked about
[01:17:56.720 --> 01:18:04.000]   amazon and there's a lot to talk about um hourly pay for amazon workers what fast days be right
[01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:08.320]   so amazon has it so they're they've raised their hourly they're a few weeks ago we said they're
[01:18:08.320 --> 01:18:14.240]   gonna hire 55 000 people in technology and corporate now they've announced they're gonna hire another
[01:18:14.240 --> 01:18:22.800]   125 000 workers for the warehouses and they're going to raise their pay minimum pay from 15 to 18
[01:18:22.800 --> 01:18:28.560]   dollars which what and at the same time they're gonna pay full college tuition for frontline employees
[01:18:29.360 --> 01:18:35.680]   that's what that just fascinates me is that it's i mean it puts tremendous pressure on walmart
[01:18:35.680 --> 01:18:43.600]   on other employers and even without congress amazon is having an impact of raising wages uh
[01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:52.000]   where they have employees and um uh at a time of tight labor at a time of difficulty it's and
[01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:56.240]   you know it's it's rather like regulatory capture amazon's doing it saying hey we can afford it so
[01:18:56.240 --> 01:19:00.400]   fine we're gonna put pressure on everybody else uh and you want to complain about unions and all
[01:19:00.400 --> 01:19:07.680]   that while we pay more um uh so i'm not saying it's all um golden-hearted but it is really
[01:19:07.680 --> 01:19:12.560]   interesting how a company that size can have that kind of influence on the economy as a whole
[01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:16.320]   so i just wanted to make a mention of that i would i think it's great and i would love to see them
[01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:23.200]   make working conditions more tolerable yeah because you're earning those that 18 dollars i mean it is
[01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:29.680]   hard work and it's hard on the body but yeah they have that college fund it that's paying full
[01:19:29.680 --> 01:19:35.120]   tuition and if i read it right i said they're paying it upfront it's not something that you have to pay
[01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:40.160]   like that it comes at the end where they reimburse you anything they're going ahead and and paying
[01:19:40.160 --> 01:19:45.760]   it and it made me think okay if these working conditions are are known to be so terrible and
[01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:51.920]   you're a college student how where's the balance how is that going to work out is this a way for
[01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:58.160]   them to change the culture that they have um people just assuming their working conditions are so bad
[01:19:58.160 --> 01:20:03.280]   will it change for the people not going to college or i just had a couple different
[01:20:03.280 --> 01:20:08.080]   questions about all of that and one thing i've heard too is that they recognize that
[01:20:08.080 --> 01:20:11.920]   that eventually robots will replace more and more of these people and they want to be able to say
[01:20:11.920 --> 01:20:17.600]   well we got them ready for that world uh yeah right it gets to me it comes down to is this well
[01:20:17.600 --> 01:20:22.400]   we're going to raise it 18 bucks now don't pay attention anything else or is this Andy jassy
[01:20:22.400 --> 01:20:28.000]   the new ceo saying no we you know what we clearly it's reputationally hurting us we've got to do
[01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:33.200]   something about it so let's do some things and i bet you there's more i hope there's more to make
[01:20:33.200 --> 01:20:38.880]   this a better job for people you know it's hard work it's warehouse work it's hard work
[01:20:38.880 --> 01:20:42.960]   um so it's is it enough just to say well we're going to pay them more
[01:20:45.600 --> 01:20:49.520]   and and get i agree with you give you advocate educational opportunities is great because that
[01:20:49.520 --> 01:20:54.240]   means i i think that's more important if they can actually if you have the time and the ability to
[01:20:54.240 --> 01:21:00.320]   do it that actually does help you like level up if you're interested in that and a lot of people
[01:21:00.320 --> 01:21:10.080]   probably are good all right my former ceo i remember when we went to a more automated system
[01:21:10.080 --> 01:21:16.560]   for our clients and hanging out in the gym with the ceo he says you know i want us to have this product
[01:21:16.560 --> 01:21:24.400]   to where our staff can do more things that require some brain power not just be somebody pushing
[01:21:24.400 --> 01:21:32.080]   a button and so we went into this automated process and and it did it made people put their
[01:21:32.080 --> 01:21:36.720]   thinking caps on and be a little bit more analytical about the day-to-day operations versus just
[01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:43.440]   straight up data entry at the desk you know so i totally dig if if they're trying to set up the
[01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:49.440]   staff to be ready to maintain the robots so the robots don't take us over i i salute you for that
[01:21:49.440 --> 01:22:01.520]   Amazon is also making their first tv set the fire tv after you knew who were the
[01:22:01.520 --> 01:22:07.680]   four folks who bought their Amazon phone yeah i'm a phone of mine Amazon tv uh new they're putting
[01:22:07.680 --> 01:22:13.120]   tick-tock on it that's good well the podcast is actually partnering with high sense to make their
[01:22:13.120 --> 01:22:18.720]   own i saw that too so yeah i'm like everybody needs it there's so much data on those platforms
[01:22:18.720 --> 01:22:24.080]   that's what it's going to be moving to a streaming yeah that's what last last week we had the story
[01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:32.560]   of the the tv as the ad platform now so yeah mhm the uh xfinity tv made by com the
[01:22:32.560 --> 01:22:38.960]   comp has in high sense will have Comcast's x1 box built into it that's the other reason they want to
[01:22:38.960 --> 01:22:43.920]   do but i think you're right and stacy it's it's really it's all about data spying on the spying on
[01:22:43.920 --> 01:22:56.320]   the users um Amazon to uh say Amazon CEO Andy jassy says it's hard to argue that it's a monopoly
[01:22:56.320 --> 01:23:04.480]   it's hard to argue that it's a monopoly uh he says our retail business just about 1% of the
[01:23:04.480 --> 01:23:10.160]   worldwide retail markets segment it's nowhere close to majority share we compete with very large
[01:23:10.160 --> 01:23:15.040]   marketing a little bit but yeah but there's walmart there's target there's Kroger that's a good point
[01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:22.080]   yeah can't can't disagree with him on that also uh Amazon's media ambitions are strong
[01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:29.840]   he says it's still early days for us in media this is an in interview with uh uh CNBC
[01:23:29.840 --> 01:23:35.440]   uh we're off to a great start but we do believe we have an opportunity to provide a unique viewing
[01:23:35.440 --> 01:23:41.840]   experience for our customers with really original and creative content they bought mgm for 8.45
[01:23:41.840 --> 01:23:48.400]   billion dollars i don't think that's been approved yet uh they have they spent 11 billion dollars on
[01:23:48.400 --> 01:23:55.280]   content last year they bought the lord of the rings tv series which debuts in a year for four
[01:23:55.280 --> 01:24:02.080]   hundred sixty five million dollars just for the rights and by the way i've been informed it is not
[01:24:02.080 --> 01:24:09.280]   the lord of the rings story that we've already seen made into movies uh it's it's is it a prequel
[01:24:09.280 --> 01:24:13.520]   john did you tell me it's another it's in the lord of the rings universe but it's a different
[01:24:13.520 --> 01:24:21.360]   story so all they really bought is the right to the the kind of the name um i said similar
[01:24:21.360 --> 01:24:28.240]   law law or whatever that book is similar law or similar yeah right that simmer real a lot
[01:24:28.800 --> 01:24:36.160]   similar yeah that thing nobody ever reads right have you tried to read it oh no no i barely got
[01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:42.800]   through the lord of the rings i'll be honest i'm so sorry simmer real

[01:25:41.840 --> 01:25:47.680]   merduck was did we say that he was like throwing things he was like really pissed
[01:25:47.680 --> 01:25:52.560]   was that my imagination maybe that was a dream i had
[01:25:52.560 --> 01:26:00.160]   what's the matter um the next big tech battle financial time says amazon's
[01:26:00.160 --> 01:26:07.840]   bet on health care begins to take shape we've talked with one of our sponsors amazon's pharmacy
[01:26:07.840 --> 01:26:14.080]   yeah uh but that's not all is this about their pharmacy stuff that's not all this is this is
[01:26:14.640 --> 01:26:20.640]   um hey what's your name uh help me finish surgeries it's at houston methodized hospital
[01:26:20.640 --> 01:26:26.880]   the very same technology that's plays music and sets your timer instead here's start surgery
[01:26:26.880 --> 01:26:33.360]   i hope they're not using the five boards connected to the i have the
[01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:35.120]   knee bone and i use the
[01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:36.720]   saggle i use the
[01:26:36.720 --> 01:26:43.920]   control like i got that wrong i think controlling like da Vinci like laparoscopic surgery machines
[01:26:43.920 --> 01:26:49.040]   or they you're checking off things you're checking off it says it's like it's like like a take off
[01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:55.120]   its basics um did you take out the scalpel yes i took out the scalpel so it was a big deal
[01:26:55.120 --> 01:27:01.520]   they implemented that yeah yes oh yes then it also memorializes it so you can say yeah i took
[01:27:01.520 --> 01:27:06.160]   the scalpel out i told it i took the scalpel out at 476 oh that's kind of interesting it so it forces
[01:27:06.160 --> 01:27:10.960]   like these people who are kind of like yeah i'm so awesome because i'm a surgeon it forces them to
[01:27:10.960 --> 01:27:15.920]   have to go through it and leaves a record it's also being used in consulting rooms where uh
[01:27:15.920 --> 01:27:21.760]   the doctor can add information to the health record with the patient's consent by saying you
[01:27:21.760 --> 01:27:28.720]   know hey now i have to say i don't use i don't use the a word i use ziggy and i have the male
[01:27:28.720 --> 01:27:35.520]   voice but then i've recently added samuel jackson melissa mccarcy so and i it's like it's got a
[01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:40.160]   multiple personality because if you say whatever person's name if you say hey samuel so i think i
[01:27:40.160 --> 01:27:46.560]   want the physician to say hey samuel this guy's got a bunion yes what do you mean a bunion
[01:27:46.560 --> 01:27:57.280]   samuel if you ask if you go hey samuel why do you cuss so much just try it i'll leave it at that
[01:27:57.280 --> 01:28:00.240]   swear it's a bubble blue streak it's great
[01:28:00.240 --> 01:28:07.680]   so instead of typing in a keyboard the doctor is actually kind of saying hey remember this remember
[01:28:07.680 --> 01:28:13.360]   that i think that'll be because right now they they dictate to a like almost a dictaphone
[01:28:13.360 --> 01:28:19.040]   well this is when you talk to us so when you go to a at least my doctor my doctor is sitting
[01:28:19.040 --> 01:28:24.880]   often is sitting at a keyboard looking at my medical record this is at kizer big hmo and then
[01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:28.560]   he'll talk to me and he's very nice he's personal i love my doctor he actually listens to our shows
[01:28:28.560 --> 01:28:35.360]   so hi steven hi doc hi doc hi leo's doctor don't put a don't put a man on that stupid diet i
[01:28:35.360 --> 01:28:39.120]   want to say it was really grumpy no no he didn't put me on that diet he said don't do it
[01:28:39.120 --> 01:28:44.000]   okay good thanks doc i have to say the last checkup i had i zoomed check up with him he says
[01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:50.560]   before we go can i ask you a tech question i said okay what he said should i buy the model y or the
[01:28:50.560 --> 01:28:57.040]   maki nice i can't win it a whole thing i you know i'm love he said well that's good because i put
[01:28:57.040 --> 01:29:01.760]   it in order on the maki i said we shouldn't tell me that upfront anyway no he's great he's
[01:29:01.760 --> 01:29:06.640]   he's a but he's but he spends a lot of the time typing while he's talking he's always entering
[01:29:06.640 --> 01:29:11.040]   in notes as he's talking that's how he doesn't i guess that's replaced a pen and paper and yeah
[01:29:11.040 --> 01:29:16.000]   used to be pen and pen yeah i know it doesn't bother me did by place they dictate do they
[01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:20.720]   bother talking to you directly um no they take down notes and then they have to go afterwards
[01:29:20.720 --> 01:29:27.200]   and they dictate yeah yeah uh so i don't know it'd be a little weird if he's if he's doing it while
[01:29:27.200 --> 01:29:33.760]   you're he's talking to you so he says so so leo has your sleep uh it's not so good doc his sleep
[01:29:33.760 --> 01:29:43.120]   is not so good and uh do you feel this cough he's coughing
[01:29:43.120 --> 01:29:55.520]   the prostate's okay it's okay in there uh let me out of here so amazon

[01:31:41.760 --> 01:31:46.800]   you keep it up elan keep up the good work see do i have three days where the movies this is gonna
[01:31:46.800 --> 01:31:50.720]   be really boring now see the earth you know what's the what's the deal one of the things about
[01:31:50.720 --> 01:31:55.680]   this inspiration for is the first civilian all civilian crew on an all civilian craft with an
[01:31:55.680 --> 01:32:02.000]   all civilian company it is launching from cape kenavril uh but you know an asset launch pad but
[01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:07.040]   they all the civilian space companies have offices down there i love also that they've
[01:32:07.040 --> 01:32:14.480]   designed is is mission control civilian as well yeah it's space x it's so weird to watch mission
[01:32:14.480 --> 01:32:20.480]   control uh on a space x launch because it's like a bunch of jibb yeah yeah you know have them on
[01:32:20.480 --> 01:32:26.800]   short some flip flops no seriously they're on Hawaiian shirts they're basically sitting at like
[01:32:26.800 --> 01:32:32.320]   folding tables with computers on them it's not all right it doesn't feel it is not the nasa mission
[01:32:32.320 --> 01:32:38.000]   control not quite but you know what it's probably more realistic the other thing i love he designed
[01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:43.040]   the suits to look like they're you know like they're like in a movie right it doesn't
[01:32:43.040 --> 01:32:49.760]   this look science fiction eats like the inside of a tesla uh no less risk maybe it's more functional
[01:32:49.760 --> 01:33:01.840]   than looks though sir uh no one would maybe say that but i think it's really about the looks uh
[01:33:01.840 --> 01:33:06.480]   it's cool it's very cool i now john you're gonna have to you john's our space expert
[01:33:06.480 --> 01:33:10.560]   i've seen in some articles it says that the flight is entirely controlled from ground
[01:33:10.560 --> 01:33:14.240]   but it does feel like these guys have something to do up there they're
[01:33:14.240 --> 01:33:20.560]   yeah they're tapping on their ipads if there's an issue okay so it is it's not fully autonomous
[01:33:20.560 --> 01:33:26.880]   in the sense that houston or ground control control it but else i couldn't know see there's
[01:33:26.880 --> 01:33:33.920]   the difference kennedy space center in houston no it's actually an elsa gundo on route 405 but
[01:33:33.920 --> 01:33:39.600]   it's a great place there's a donut shop just around the corner uh if if they lose control of it they'll
[01:33:39.600 --> 01:33:45.680]   they can take over but they're not what what one would call fully-trained astronauts i think
[01:33:45.680 --> 01:33:50.640]   jared is a pilot in florida i know i'm just joking around oh okay i was like that's not right it's
[01:33:50.640 --> 01:33:55.680]   johnson space center and i know it's i was like i grew up there it's johnson am i writing
[01:33:55.680 --> 01:34:02.960]   the johnson it is it is the johnson space center and space x is in torrents not elsa gundo it's just
[01:34:02.960 --> 01:34:08.800]   down the 405 a piece it is in the same sorry leo sorry we space nerds they want you to get it right
[01:34:08.800 --> 01:34:15.200]   get it right space nary john right okay it does look like the uh spacesuits from prometheus
[01:34:15.200 --> 01:34:19.360]   from the movies i really think but they didn't have ipads in there that's so cool
[01:34:19.360 --> 01:34:24.480]   so cool they're gonna be it's gonna be a night launch a dark launch which is always interesting
[01:34:25.280 --> 01:34:29.920]   uh we will keep an eye on that as we go update google chrome immediately
[01:34:29.920 --> 01:34:36.000]   in fact this has been a bad week for update everything immediately
[01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:43.440]   um just said everything just turned it all off let it update back up security vulnerabilities
[01:34:43.440 --> 01:34:48.400]   11 of them in chrome two of which are already in the wild that means there's zero days
[01:34:48.400 --> 01:34:56.000]   they're active that means you need to patch the patch went out on monday um and your chrome
[01:34:56.000 --> 01:35:04.080]   should now be version 93 dot o dot four five seven seven dot eighty two all you have to do
[01:35:04.080 --> 01:35:09.600]   really is launch chrome uh check about chrome and then close it and reopen it and it should
[01:35:09.600 --> 01:35:15.600]   automatically update go to that's not true of chrome os just chrome the browser chrome os if
[01:35:15.600 --> 01:35:20.160]   you go to about chrome os i think it will tell you what version and if you need a restart it'll
[01:35:20.160 --> 01:35:25.120]   tell you to restart so i think you could still do that i think it's in the system tray on the right
[01:35:25.120 --> 01:35:32.320]   there yeah usually has it right in the bottom right corner so click you take the the track pad
[01:35:32.320 --> 01:35:36.800]   that's that square thing at the bottom you move your that's what that's called yeah and then move
[01:35:36.800 --> 01:35:44.960]   your thing it's not what's the cursor laughing what's the cursor i'm old enough to remember that
[01:35:44.960 --> 01:35:49.520]   cursor the cursor is called jeff jarvis he's the cursor yeah you bet you're
[01:35:49.520 --> 01:35:52.000]   the cursor
[01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:55.520]   samuel jackson uh

[01:39:18.480 --> 01:39:24.240]   be kind of a journalist round table dan gillmore uh from the formerly the san le's a mercury news but
[01:39:24.240 --> 01:39:29.600]   but he's been working at the walter kronkite school in arizona on journalism so and steven
[01:39:29.600 --> 01:39:36.080]   levi who is kind of uh my personal hero of what he calls slow journalism he wrote uh the
[01:39:36.080 --> 01:39:42.480]   several of the quintessential uh tech books including hackers books and his facebook and google books
[01:39:42.480 --> 01:39:47.760]   are great anyway so that's going to be an interesting twist even maybe dan gillmore and jeff jarvis that's
[01:39:47.760 --> 01:39:51.040]   going to be i hope there's no new white and new journalism

[01:41:03.600 --> 01:41:10.400]   desk oh yeah under the desk news yeah there you go wow 1.2 million followers here let's just play a
[01:41:10.400 --> 01:41:15.600]   little bit of uh under the desk news okay to apologize for scaring the crap out of some of you
[01:41:15.600 --> 01:41:20.160]   this morning i will now give you some of the most unusual headlines related to coronavirus of the
[01:41:20.160 --> 01:41:25.440]   virus she's literally under the desk right you would just exemption if you donate to his church
[01:41:25.440 --> 01:41:31.040]   then the pope came out and encouraged catholics to get the vaccine i found this at cvs they're
[01:41:31.040 --> 01:41:35.840]   claiming that hypertonic nasal flushing can help i actually use that i roll load but i didn't see
[01:41:35.840 --> 01:41:39.360]   that part but i didn't see that part baltimore is one of 70 in the united states that will begin
[01:41:39.360 --> 01:41:44.640]   vaccinating their animals a 64 year old man who had escaped prison in australia turned himself
[01:41:44.640 --> 01:41:49.120]   back in saying because of the sittney lockdowns he can't find any work and he doesn't like okay we
[01:41:49.120 --> 01:41:53.360]   don't have to do the whole thing but that's good i'll i'm subscribing right now that's great
[01:41:53.360 --> 01:42:01.040]   he's uh what pronoun i shouldn't assume this she doesn't suggest yes they them sorry they they
[01:42:01.040 --> 01:42:07.600]   i apologize i had to check the uh profile cool under the desk and they actually are
[01:42:07.600 --> 01:42:16.560]   hundred the desk geez or they they do above the desk news for is it fridays they they do
[01:42:17.120 --> 01:42:24.080]   above the desk at the at nighttime is for the alisabeth home's trial and then they have oh i
[01:42:24.080 --> 01:42:29.360]   gotta watch that for fun news but it's a little it's like got a little gossipy kind of you know
[01:42:29.360 --> 01:42:40.240]   yes and they do a really good job of reporting the headlines providing not much context this is
[01:42:40.240 --> 01:42:44.880]   much more like people who don't want to know what's going on but doing it in a way that feels friendly
[01:42:45.440 --> 01:42:50.480]   and then also it's fast connecting to the audience so the stuff actually about their
[01:42:50.480 --> 01:42:58.640]   coverage of leaving afghanistan was excellent i thought um because it was very much dedicated to
[01:42:58.640 --> 01:43:05.280]   or like talking to the veterans and just if you if you follow them you'll see what happens it's
[01:43:05.280 --> 01:43:11.680]   i think they do a really good job i should really get them on on that show with a bunch of old white
[01:43:11.680 --> 01:43:17.440]   men that would be be very fitting and now and you know what they could do it under the desk
[01:43:17.440 --> 01:43:24.880]   because there's lots of room i can even raise the desk so that in fact let's all be under the desk
[01:43:24.880 --> 01:43:33.120]   now the rest of the show see to play at that game the rest of the show will all be under the desk
[01:43:33.120 --> 01:43:38.080]   for the rest of the show i could do mine under the desk but my camera is still gonna go all the way
[01:43:38.080 --> 01:43:45.040]   up so your forehead is above the desk but the rest of you right now mr. Burke is cringing all right
[01:43:45.040 --> 01:43:51.040]   i'm over here yeah no mr. Burke's not cringing he's he's actually taking a nap under the desk
[01:43:51.040 --> 01:43:59.200]   that wouldn't surprise me either all right let's get back to the news at hand
[01:43:59.200 --> 01:44:04.080]   can i come out now yes what is he doing you don't have to get to the desk i automatically move you
[01:44:04.080 --> 01:44:07.360]   all into this oh he's really in the desk
[01:44:07.360 --> 01:44:14.720]   mike booms so i can do that google i was gonna do this story what else what else we were going to
[01:44:14.720 --> 01:44:20.480]   i got distracted south korea finds google for abusing smartphone dominance south korea of course
[01:44:20.480 --> 01:44:27.680]   the home of sam song sam song 177 million dollar fine is not going to break the bank
[01:44:29.120 --> 01:44:36.480]   uh sam song by the way uses android but the fine is for hampering the development of rivals to
[01:44:36.480 --> 01:44:46.800]   android i didn't understand that if this is what is it aosp um android that means you it's out there
[01:44:46.800 --> 01:44:53.120]   and available for whomever to do what they want with it so how is that considered hamper so what
[01:44:53.120 --> 01:44:59.760]   google does do and i think this is not inappropriate but that's my personal opinion uh they have android
[01:44:59.760 --> 01:45:08.800]   there is the android open software which aosp which anybody can use for free but you don't get
[01:45:08.800 --> 01:45:15.440]   access to google apps or the google services to google play to play so google strongly encourages
[01:45:15.440 --> 01:45:22.000]   people to because you can have access to services including the store to use their version of
[01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:26.880]   android and if you are going to use their version of android you have to put the store google services
[01:45:26.880 --> 01:45:33.280]   the google apps all that stuff um google's anti these they call this the anti fragmentation
[01:45:33.280 --> 01:45:39.200]   agreements uh the korean fair trade commission said the afa agreements with the manufacturers
[01:45:39.200 --> 01:45:43.760]   like sam song and lg which who is out of the business by the way prevented gadget makers
[01:45:43.760 --> 01:45:49.280]   from developing or using modified versions of the android o s that did not does not prevent them
[01:45:50.400 --> 01:45:55.040]   uh the watchdog banned google from forcing manufacturers to sign afa contracts
[01:45:55.040 --> 01:46:03.360]   ordered that it modify existing ones is it more so that google forced them or the market forces
[01:46:03.360 --> 01:46:09.440]   the market the market says because you can for instance that's what china did they just you know
[01:46:09.440 --> 01:46:15.840]   they don't have google services in their phone yeah not not as desirable in my opinion i agree
[01:46:17.920 --> 01:46:24.240]   um the google quantum computer i know
[01:46:24.240 --> 01:46:28.240]   nope
[01:46:28.240 --> 01:46:32.560]   why are we giving up on google's we did that story this is just a real story but this is another one
[01:46:32.560 --> 01:46:38.160]   saying how it's going to change everything they made another time crystal oh great yeah sure appreciate
[01:46:38.160 --> 01:46:43.840]   nice thank you i still won't understand now we have two that's good we need we need all the time
[01:46:43.840 --> 01:46:50.320]   i'm just seeing had it they had a good story on quantum uh computing that was actually pretty
[01:46:50.320 --> 01:46:58.480]   accessible i'm not worried about not understanding it i'm i'm worried that it is kind of out of the
[01:46:58.480 --> 01:47:03.840]   reach of science i suppose maybe we'll solve it someday but scientists are glad to take government
[01:47:03.840 --> 01:47:09.440]   research funds and build beautiful labs like that google quantum lab because say free money
[01:47:10.400 --> 01:47:14.960]   and i guess it makes sense that the government should be funding this kind of research
[01:47:14.960 --> 01:47:20.720]   because what if the chinese come up with one before we do right but i don't think anybody
[01:47:20.720 --> 01:47:27.680]   got come up with one anytime soon so but i'm not an expert in quantum so uh quantum computing so
[01:47:27.680 --> 01:47:32.960]   i'll just i was someday one of these days we'll get somebody's really uh up on this like a real
[01:47:32.960 --> 01:47:38.480]   person doing it and we can just kind of say really come on what is what is the real person doing
[01:47:38.480 --> 01:47:44.240]   it don't want to be on air say say again stacey the d-wave guys will come on and talk about quantum
[01:47:44.240 --> 01:47:49.440]   computing till your hair falls out yeah but are they actual quantum physicists um they've been
[01:47:49.440 --> 01:47:54.320]   doing it they've been building an actual quantum computer for the last 20 years so see but see i
[01:47:54.320 --> 01:48:03.360]   feel like yeah they're these things are not stable they're very hard to get in the i mean it's very
[01:48:03.360 --> 01:48:08.160]   confusing to me that doesn't seem like they're able to make these do anything useful except
[01:48:08.160 --> 01:48:14.160]   make time crystals here but we'll get the d-wave i'm putting a note in the
[01:48:14.160 --> 01:48:19.440]   in the head can it hard boil an egg without water that's what i want to know well the real question
[01:48:19.440 --> 01:48:24.560]   is that's not would you do that with us could it could it do things like break you know rsa
[01:48:24.560 --> 01:48:31.600]   encryption and stuff yes it could break rsa encryption if it's ever works no right it's
[01:48:31.600 --> 01:48:36.240]   good we're actually only a few years out theoretically we've been a few years out for several decades
[01:48:36.240 --> 01:48:42.000]   that's my that's my issue with this the paper was off a little while yeah it's been a few years
[01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:47.760]   off for a long time a few years for more than a few years google is facing an EU anti-trust
[01:48:47.760 --> 01:48:52.960]   investigation uh over whether it may be similar problem whether it may be forcing
[01:48:52.960 --> 01:48:58.560]   device makers to install google assistant as the default voice assistant on android this is just
[01:48:58.560 --> 01:49:03.920]   an investigation though that will keep you posted there's always investigations going on in this
[01:49:03.920 --> 01:49:12.320]   kind of thing um do you want to talk about germany's sovereign cloud i figure it's got the word germany
[01:49:12.320 --> 01:49:19.040]   and it's a jeff javis story i just it was just a quick take mention that um that was a stacy story
[01:49:19.040 --> 01:49:24.560]   because i said cloud how are they going to do it my google i thought it was an ant story because it
[01:49:24.560 --> 01:49:31.200]   says sovereign sovereign how are they going to do it and they're going to do it with
[01:49:31.200 --> 01:49:38.560]   with google actually uh it's interesting because it was microsoft and sachin Adele who kept talking
[01:49:38.560 --> 01:49:46.880]   about sovereign sovereignty uh in his last uh speech at one of the one of the microsoft developer
[01:49:46.880 --> 01:49:53.600]   conferences and i really took that as an indication that microsoft was going to reach out to individual
[01:49:53.600 --> 01:49:58.720]   countries and say look we will we will provide you with servers you can keep it all locally this is
[01:49:58.720 --> 01:50:05.440]   something microsoft fought for a long time um but it's reality just so many countries actually put
[01:50:05.440 --> 01:50:11.600]   these laws into place you know big new undersea cable did you see the this is the i keep seeing this
[01:50:11.600 --> 01:50:19.440]   picture cracks me up of of the uh grace hopper cable coming up on the land in the uh in the uk
[01:50:20.800 --> 01:50:25.520]   it's a transatlantic cable this seems kind of low tech when i look at this picture yeah how do they
[01:50:25.520 --> 01:50:29.440]   do the last mile to get the cable from the ship apparently with a there a bulldozer
[01:50:29.440 --> 01:50:39.600]   surf it in i don't overthink it they they actually so these used to be so insecure in the sense that
[01:50:39.600 --> 01:50:45.120]   literally they would end at these like little huts on the beach that like had a padlock on it
[01:50:45.120 --> 01:50:51.680]   like a wooden hut with a padlock on the door so they've upped the security but even like a decade ago
[01:50:51.680 --> 01:50:57.840]   you could visit some of these places and you'd be like oh look there's there's the the termination
[01:50:57.840 --> 01:51:03.280]   point for you know an eighth of the internet's traffic coming from europe and you're like there
[01:51:03.280 --> 01:51:08.880]   it is just on a beach in new jersey we're getting to that silly season the phone season we had an
[01:51:08.880 --> 01:51:13.840]   apple event yesterday uh remember i talked last week that some rumors and maybe even that google
[01:51:13.840 --> 01:51:17.840]   video tip that maybe monday they would announce the pixel six it did not happen
[01:51:17.840 --> 01:51:23.520]   probably it's going to be later uh next month but they are starting to hype it up with the videos
[01:51:23.520 --> 01:51:29.440]   and so forth in japan uh to promote the idea that the new pixel six will have a google designed
[01:51:29.440 --> 01:51:37.360]   uh processor system on a chip they're selling google original chips in a google
[01:51:37.360 --> 01:51:44.080]   googly salty flavor oh we need those we need those come on google send us some google yeah yeah
[01:51:44.080 --> 01:51:48.080]   yeah yeah you'll be all got donuts what do you want you can't give you got a whole show about you
[01:51:48.080 --> 01:51:53.920]   you can't give them the chips come on geez are they just salty chips i don't really care if they're
[01:51:53.920 --> 01:51:59.520]   i'd like some vinegar too yeah yeah i agree uh well google you can't do better than that just
[01:51:59.520 --> 01:52:06.720]   salt geez just salt i'm like i have to say this here i am i'm gonna skip the iphone and buy the pixel
[01:52:06.720 --> 01:52:13.520]   six just give it a try we'll see are you serious yeah well the other thing i bought an ipad mini and
[01:52:13.520 --> 01:52:19.920]   i could use that as a phone if i get desperate and i still have the old uh i i phone so i'm probably
[01:52:19.920 --> 01:52:22.800]   really not well because there was basically nothing interesting right there wasn't that much
[01:52:22.800 --> 01:52:29.040]   to get excited about i didn't the cameras look pretty good but uh you want to get it instead and
[01:52:29.040 --> 01:52:33.760]   take some pictures with it and do some stuff the pro the pro looked quite fascinating to me yeah
[01:52:33.760 --> 01:52:39.920]   just from the camera standpoint the rest of the os i i am not an ios fan right i'm just not right but
[01:52:39.920 --> 01:52:46.000]   what they did with their um photography side of the stuff looks looks pretty damn good it's got i
[01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:51.760]   think it's got not great it's it's it's computational you know like the focus pull and stuff but i
[01:52:51.760 --> 01:52:59.680]   would still like to see that coupled with like filmic pro it has actual optical zoom uh a total
[01:52:59.680 --> 01:53:05.360]   of six x over the three lenses they're very fast lenses now the the the uh the camera that's
[01:53:05.360 --> 01:53:13.760]   one of lenses 1.5 oh one five that's pretty fast yeah uh very large um pixels i think one and a half
[01:53:13.760 --> 01:53:19.840]   micron so i think these are getting what's interesting is for a long time you would have a real camera
[01:53:19.840 --> 01:53:24.800]   because of the you know you could have zoom lenses multiple lenses multiple focal lengths you could
[01:53:24.800 --> 01:53:29.920]   control aperture you had a lot more control over it you had macro now all of that stuff's being put
[01:53:29.920 --> 01:53:36.960]   in a phone yeah so it macros what got me yeah to be able to to put your device that close to your
[01:53:36.960 --> 01:53:42.480]   subject to be able to get that one to one two centimeters oh man that's centimeter focal length
[01:53:42.480 --> 01:53:47.280]   i want to see that because i want to do macro i have to put these extension tubes on my camera
[01:53:47.280 --> 01:53:51.840]   right to get close and get that okay i guess i'll buy it yeah you talk to me
[01:53:53.840 --> 01:54:00.960]   that was easy and we won all right okay never notice this this we get google but that
[01:54:00.960 --> 01:54:05.360]   i get fascinating all right in there now it's gonna be a big i want to try some close-up pictures
[01:54:05.360 --> 01:54:12.320]   wait what is kenta flavoring uh i think these are for the japanese market i don't know i don't
[01:54:12.320 --> 01:54:17.360]   know what that is okay it's just a peach flavored powder drink firm into japanese so it isn't just
[01:54:17.360 --> 01:54:23.680]   salt it's salts and peaches oh google just stick with the salt please really i just keep it
[01:54:23.680 --> 01:54:31.200]   i have to i should i should go get them lisa somebody sent lisa because this is like senna's food
[01:54:31.200 --> 01:54:37.200]   week i don't know somebody sent lisa um some pokimon flavored oreos what the hell pokimon
[01:54:37.200 --> 01:54:41.440]   flavor what the hell flavor with that the this is what oh it tastes like Pikachu
[01:54:41.440 --> 01:54:52.080]   pokimon flavored oreos come on let's do the google you know thing thing you know the thing
[01:54:52.080 --> 01:55:00.800]   the google changelog it's t minus one hour and counting we're getting closer to the inspiration
[01:55:00.800 --> 01:55:04.720]   for launch window and i should say window because it doesn't have to launch exactly
[01:55:05.280 --> 01:55:11.360]   at that time yeah may not but the launch window is exactly one hour away in the google changelog
[01:55:11.360 --> 01:55:19.280]   google is hosting the search on 2021 keynote later this month every answer leads to a new question
[01:55:19.280 --> 01:55:26.400]   uh wednesday september 29th 10 a.m pacific maybe we'll uh maybe we should do a live stream i don't
[01:55:26.400 --> 01:55:34.320]   know what do you think in the past we haven't covered these because they no they but maybe
[01:55:34.320 --> 01:55:41.200]   just silence no i don't know all right i'll think about it i'll i'll uh i'll table that for now
[01:55:41.200 --> 01:55:50.640]   hands-on from android police with the google assistant driving modes long-awaited new home screen
[01:55:50.640 --> 01:55:59.440]   is there getting rid of the android auto app still have android auto which i have to say it
[01:56:00.560 --> 01:56:08.000]   i'm not as fond of as uh car people's carplay here's the new ui yeah carplay is much not well what do you
[01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:15.600]   use jefy you of course you use android auto you wait you out you down what's this show called
[01:56:15.600 --> 01:56:26.080]   well i just use whatever i like and i like carplay so there it is i don't know the assistant driving
[01:56:26.080 --> 01:56:33.760]   mode so this i guess is the idea is it replaces that android auto app um well replaces it on the
[01:56:33.760 --> 01:56:39.360]   phone yeah yeah you still have android this was confusing seven android auto on the car screen
[01:56:39.360 --> 01:56:45.440]   so how do you get to this i don't know well people who don't have android auto right if you have a
[01:56:45.440 --> 01:56:51.120]   car that doesn't have you know it's an on a fancy fancy fancy car like jeff's you you have
[01:56:51.120 --> 01:56:56.480]   where it's like a tesla or it's a t yeah you know i feel bad for tesla people oh you're one of those
[01:56:56.480 --> 01:57:04.080]   aren't you stacy do you just put my foot my mouth everywhere where i go do you really like the
[01:57:04.080 --> 01:57:10.480]   media interface for the tesla's i feel like i wish they had carplay or uh android auto i don't love it
[01:57:10.480 --> 01:57:16.000]   but i don't to me that's a big negative time in it yeah but she doesn't have the car for that
[01:57:17.280 --> 01:57:21.360]   for the media i have the car because it's fun to drive it is fun to drive and i also have
[01:57:21.360 --> 01:57:26.160]   oh usually there's someone in the front seat with me and i just work for my phone i usually play
[01:57:26.160 --> 01:57:30.880]   spotify for all the it supports bluetooth so you can tesla yeah and tesla actually supports
[01:57:30.880 --> 01:57:38.320]   spotify now so it's a little bit better the one reason is a little issue uh one of my friends uh
[01:57:38.320 --> 01:57:45.360]   sent me a note saying i i quit club to it i said oh why he said because it's not supported by uh
[01:57:45.360 --> 01:57:50.080]   tesla i said well you can do it on your phone he said no it's too much trouble you got to do a deal
[01:57:50.080 --> 01:57:55.200]   with the tune in or something so that i can hear and it's um it's like well it doesn't work that way
[01:57:55.200 --> 01:58:03.280]   you got to have your own private feed so i don't know hey you can have easy to use and convenient and
[01:58:03.280 --> 01:58:10.720]   not you know and add supported or you can pay for things i said little weird the elon is so not
[01:58:10.720 --> 01:58:16.080]   invented here that he won't allow carplay and android auto it is a little weird it's not what i
[01:58:16.080 --> 01:58:22.560]   expect of him yeah i mean the reason is that those those are getting updated faster even than a tesla
[01:58:22.560 --> 01:58:27.440]   is you know and they have more features and more apps and i don't know yeah okay so you could play
[01:58:27.440 --> 01:58:35.360]   uh you could play control free concern so i will tell you i love the tesla's games and no because
[01:58:35.360 --> 01:58:40.240]   we're sometimes waiting we're waiting for a ferry and sometimes you get there and you're like you
[01:58:40.240 --> 01:58:45.200]   missed it and so you're like you're there for an hour stacy or like 45 minutes there's no such thing
[01:58:45.200 --> 01:58:53.280]   as fairies you're gonna be waiting a really long time everybody clap their hands we're waiting
[01:58:53.280 --> 01:59:00.160]   for a ferry everybody google photos will now ship individual prints directly to your door
[01:59:01.120 --> 01:59:08.160]   whoa okay don't they do that already i advertise that all the stuff i wanna expand
[01:59:08.160 --> 01:59:12.320]   now you can order prints of specific photographs of getting shipped to homes in the us for as little
[01:59:12.320 --> 01:59:19.520]   as 18 cents plus shipping instead of oh okay so because they sell you books that actually might be
[01:59:19.520 --> 01:59:22.640]   fun oh maybe they didn't sell prints they didn't sell prints so this is like instead of going to
[01:59:22.640 --> 01:59:27.440]   Costco you just get a print right instead of a book instead of a book you get a single and uh
[01:59:27.440 --> 01:59:32.400]   what it costs like the big box stores are like 11 cents a print right so this is a little pricey
[01:59:32.400 --> 01:59:37.440]   but i bet they're good quality if you can't wait you can also get your photos printed for
[01:59:37.440 --> 01:59:43.520]   same-day pickup from your local cvs wall greens or walmart in the us or 7-11 in japan because they
[01:59:43.520 --> 01:59:49.840]   sell everything everything four by six five by seven or eight by ten prints in the us three and a
[01:59:49.840 --> 01:59:57.360]   half by five in japan they also do canvas prints and of course they still have ordered a canvas
[01:59:57.360 --> 02:00:03.360]   print from google photos and it turned out really well i love them i we've been printing uh on metal
[02:00:03.360 --> 02:00:09.760]   and glass as well as canvas oh metal yeah i did want a metal if it's the right photo i contrast
[02:00:09.760 --> 02:00:14.400]   yeah yeah i see the contrast for a metal screen it's be the right photo but it really if you got
[02:00:14.400 --> 02:00:19.120]   the right photo uh we've got some beautiful metal photos and which is nice because when they get
[02:00:19.120 --> 02:00:25.120]   knocked off the wall they don't break at least clank but what the hell was that oh the photos
[02:00:25.120 --> 02:00:35.920]   were the wall uh no this must be Jeff this must be Jeff no he was rejoicing dark mode i keep getting
[02:00:35.920 --> 02:00:41.120]   this notification that i can get dark mode on desktop why why why why why why why why why why why
[02:00:41.120 --> 02:00:49.040]   why because it hurts my eyes oh it does not let me see if you know there's a reason to do it if you

[02:04:58.480 --> 02:05:05.680]   because i signed up earlier on the government official member of the press
[02:05:05.680 --> 02:05:12.560]   oh but llc or google lc oh i'm all of the above i'm gonna lie you're a government official
[02:05:13.120 --> 02:05:16.320]   yeah i'm the president of club twit oh
[02:05:16.320 --> 02:05:21.120]   um i thought you said your new libertarian sees deading f operation
[02:05:21.120 --> 02:05:28.080]   your seven dollars gets you into this i can buy a little google one has added a new tier
[02:05:28.080 --> 02:05:35.920]   for people who really need a lot of storage this would be for you aunt five terabytes
[02:05:37.040 --> 02:05:40.880]   only 25 bucks a month actually that's not a bad price that's not bad
[02:05:40.880 --> 02:05:46.720]   wow not bad so it's a buck 99 for 100 gigabytes
[02:05:46.720 --> 02:05:53.840]   299 for 200 gigabytes i do the 10 dollar a month to terabyte plan that's what i do
[02:05:53.840 --> 02:06:00.320]   which is a lot i'm gonna i don't really need oh there's an easy so now you believe it goes
[02:06:00.320 --> 02:06:04.480]   how would you like i just want more terabytes 10 terabytes how would you like that
[02:06:05.040 --> 02:06:10.240]   50 dollars a month so there's five terabytes is actually the new one
[02:06:10.240 --> 02:06:17.040]   in between the two and the ten 25 bucks a month which makes sense it's kind of linear
[02:06:17.040 --> 02:06:23.520]   i think that has something to do with the fact that google photos is now using your your storage
[02:06:23.520 --> 02:06:27.840]   up a little bit they knew all along yeah and that's

[02:10:53.120 --> 02:11:01.120]   launch it's getting dark a cape canavril on pad 39a and as you can see i think we're on schedule
[02:11:01.120 --> 02:11:08.560]   because is that movement yeah the gantry is the arm is moving away which means the rocket is
[02:11:08.560 --> 02:11:15.840]   standing on its own so they are on schedule for a launch at about 8 p.m. eastern time look at that
[02:11:15.840 --> 02:11:26.240]   very exciting stacy higginbotham all right i can't show this to you because i don't own one but
[02:11:26.240 --> 02:11:31.200]   just talk about it yeah this is also a little bit promotional because this is my guess for tomorrow
[02:11:31.200 --> 02:11:36.400]   on the show oh but i don't care because it's amazing he's one of my favorite people ever um
[02:11:36.400 --> 02:11:46.320]   so this is called lucy this is a company in colorado they built an add-on to a power wheelchair
[02:11:46.320 --> 02:11:51.280]   and so what you may not realize about power wheelchairs is they cost like 80 thousand dollars in
[02:11:51.280 --> 02:11:58.400]   domino's a rock are you kidding um they're basically a battery a joystick the chair in a seat belt
[02:11:58.400 --> 02:12:08.560]   it costs more than my mochi yeah they're super expensive um and that's also a huge risk for people
[02:12:08.560 --> 02:12:15.520]   they like a two and a half inch height differential can actually just tip them over because the
[02:12:15.520 --> 02:12:20.720]   very top head the other day lisa was walking her to the bank and a guy was going ahead of one
[02:12:20.720 --> 02:12:25.920]   of motorized wheelchair was going up an incline got turned sideways slightly fell off she helped
[02:12:25.920 --> 02:12:31.760]   him he was okay he helped him back in and his his sister was across the street she came running
[02:12:31.760 --> 02:12:37.760]   over said thank you i told him don't don't leave the house without me um yeah you're right it's
[02:12:37.760 --> 02:12:43.520]   he and this wasn't a much of an incline but it's very easy to ten percent grade like that's it
[02:12:43.520 --> 02:12:50.720]   that's totally crazy so these guys uh some of the there this guy his niece is in a power wheelchair
[02:12:50.720 --> 02:12:58.080]   and so they built lusi which is it's eight thousand dollars but they combine a stereo camera
[02:12:58.080 --> 02:13:06.160]   ultrasonic sensors and millimeter wave is smart wheelchair it's a no it's it's an accessory so you
[02:13:06.160 --> 02:13:11.760]   just strap this on your wheelchair and then so they're showing you the pieces and then it actually
[02:13:11.760 --> 02:13:18.880]   can detect when it should stop so just like your rumba stops when it sees like on the stairs nice
[02:13:19.280 --> 02:13:25.520]   and the the interview was so great because he talks about like how difficult it was to like
[02:13:25.520 --> 02:13:30.080]   find these sensors so if you're super nerdy and engineering like it's pretty cool but the other
[02:13:30.080 --> 02:13:37.520]   thing that i love about this is they've also added radios to it so they're hoping to communicate
[02:13:37.520 --> 02:13:42.240]   with like smart city efforts or something like google maps so they can actually this would be
[02:13:42.240 --> 02:13:46.240]   so cool it'd be like street view for anybody who's in a wheelchair because you know it's really hard
[02:13:46.240 --> 02:13:52.160]   to get that data so they want to like so i'm telling everybody if you're at google and you watch this
[02:13:52.160 --> 02:13:57.600]   like google's already asking me like hey is this restaurant does it have a wheelchair ramp you
[02:13:57.600 --> 02:14:02.480]   know and i'm like yeah you could just get this automatically from this this company so i'm
[02:14:02.480 --> 02:14:08.160]   really excited about i and you're going to interview the founder tomorrow on the iot show
[02:14:08.160 --> 02:14:15.360]   yeah yeah he's my guest tomorrow on the iot podcast the so the luci.com if you want to know more and
[02:14:15.360 --> 02:14:19.040]   then you've got to listen to that what you should be listening anyway the outt podcast
[02:14:19.040 --> 02:14:26.080]   tomorrow oh this is so cool this is awesome yeah is it i it's a really cool like and they've
[02:14:26.080 --> 02:14:33.600]   been working on this since 2017 it launched february of this year it's like i'm gonna get all emotional
[02:14:33.600 --> 02:14:39.520]   for a second i love the it because it makes the invisible visible and there's no one more invisible
[02:14:39.520 --> 02:14:45.360]   than people in wheelchairs and by taking data from something like this and sharing this
[02:14:45.360 --> 02:14:55.760]   you give so much power to them and i i hope he does well this is so great this is such a good idea
[02:14:55.760 --> 02:15:02.480]   it's not about something it's not an autonomous wheelchair but it helps it's not autonomous it's
[02:15:02.480 --> 02:15:09.120]   just it makes it smart it it stops before it like runs into things it even stops before it runs into
[02:15:09.120 --> 02:15:15.600]   people and had that guy uh been had this he wouldn't have fallen over yeah and it's actually a really
[02:15:15.600 --> 02:15:20.880]   common problem they they said since they launched they've saved 10 000 falls so far oh my god which
[02:15:20.880 --> 02:15:26.000]   is a lot and if you think about it a lot of people who are quadriplegic are in these so when they
[02:15:26.000 --> 02:15:33.280]   fall they they can't do anything yeah it's a serious problem yeah yeah oh that's great
[02:15:34.000 --> 02:15:39.760]   using intel real sense technology that's really interesting neat thank you why that's really
[02:15:39.760 --> 02:15:47.360]   inspiring and mr gf jr vist you have a number i have a few one i want to mention andi slavitt
[02:15:47.360 --> 02:15:55.200]   um why do i know that name he's been our our our covid czar oh yes of course so i think this is
[02:15:55.200 --> 02:15:59.760]   an important number first all to know we are now at 12 billion doses and arms are required to get
[02:15:59.760 --> 02:16:05.040]   the majority of adults vaccinated we stand at 5.5 billion averaging 1 billion a month
[02:16:05.040 --> 02:16:11.200]   and the emphasizes this not about money and it's not about even manufacturing it's about last
[02:16:11.200 --> 02:16:18.240]   mile distribution interesting so i just want so the vaccines exist and the ones that are being
[02:16:18.240 --> 02:16:24.960]   made is it is it so it's not merely uh vaccine reluctance well that's in this country that's
[02:16:24.960 --> 02:16:29.760]   the problem yeah okay we are now we were we this is closed this is majority of adults in the world
[02:16:29.760 --> 02:16:35.360]   world world yeah of course it is yeah yeah so we we were the obviously leading country we had the
[02:16:35.360 --> 02:16:39.680]   vaccines we have the money we have everything was great we all the structure and now we're following
[02:16:39.680 --> 02:16:47.360]   way behind other countries and they're getting way ahead of us so that's one two look what i got

[02:20:22.880 --> 02:20:31.600]   um first off i want to say the photography workshop that i am teaching at has been rescheduled oh no
[02:20:31.600 --> 02:20:37.920]   it's going to be held in new orleans oh we all know what just recently happened in new orleans yes
[02:20:37.920 --> 02:20:43.840]   so we were concerned about it being totally canceled but it has not been canceled it has been
[02:20:43.840 --> 02:20:50.160]   rescheduled to january i believe it's the 23rd it's when it kicks off i'm feeling better for you i
[02:20:50.160 --> 02:20:54.400]   think that's a good thing january twenty third thank you i know it's awful but i think you're gonna
[02:20:54.400 --> 02:21:00.000]   be safer you'll have fun yeah so um if you're interested in checking out the workshop go to
[02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:06.880]   wanderers photo dot com and uh go register and and uh we'll see you in new orleans in january
[02:21:07.920 --> 02:21:14.080]   um but my other pick is dry bar i don't know if you've ever heard of it but youtube
[02:21:14.080 --> 02:21:23.280]   i hear dry please youtube is has the best algorithm it recommends uh comedy stand up all the time to
[02:21:23.280 --> 02:21:28.480]   me because that's what i like to watch and there's this place in utah i believe it's sought like
[02:21:28.480 --> 02:21:33.360]   it's called dry bar and it's just a bunch of stand-up comedians and i think it's highly underrated
[02:21:33.360 --> 02:21:40.400]   and they had great morton on one of their episodes uh he's a former nfl player uh former voice over
[02:21:40.400 --> 02:21:47.760]   artist and you know he's like 67 years old now and he's just doing comedy but it's awesome and
[02:21:47.760 --> 02:21:53.680]   he's pretty diagram funny so that's dry bar on youtube but it's a lot of different comedians
[02:21:53.680 --> 02:21:59.520]   you also go dry bar dot comedy dot com and guess why it's dry because it's in salt lake city it's
[02:21:59.520 --> 02:22:04.720]   in salt lake so you can't even have a cup of coffee so enjoy so right now i'd like to come out of my
[02:22:04.720 --> 02:22:12.720]   shell a little bit and uh i'd like to act out a movie now this will be two two and a half hours
[02:22:12.720 --> 02:22:21.360]   long so some of you are still taking this seriously that's not going to work out i love this guy
[02:22:21.360 --> 02:22:29.200]   he was on uh what is it america's got talent i believe he's cute he's got he's got a lot of
[02:22:29.200 --> 02:22:35.440]   faces yeah he does a lot of facial expressions i think it was america's got talent they say he's
[02:22:35.440 --> 02:22:42.320]   a living cartoon character yeah he did a lot of the star wars voices oh a lot of the comic book
[02:22:42.320 --> 02:22:46.960]   stuff you know it's funny you wouldn't think after it seems mostly if you've been in the nfl it there's
[02:22:46.960 --> 02:22:54.080]   not a lot of second careers right right exactly if you're making sure it sails men yeah car salesman

[02:25:36.160 --> 02:25:42.800]   breaking not breaking news yes just a moment here i just saw this it said seven hours ago but
[02:25:42.800 --> 02:25:49.120]   i didn't see it did you see with the ryan lisa devin newness suit no the eighth circuit so devin
[02:25:49.120 --> 02:25:57.040]   devin newness filed a use about his cloud again yes for a story that the judge ruled that this
[02:25:57.040 --> 02:26:06.320]   original story in gq was not defamatory however after dune's sued lisa tweeted to the original
[02:26:06.320 --> 02:26:14.240]   story and the court said that was defamatory and actionable it makes no sense what but that
[02:26:14.240 --> 02:26:19.360]   constituted a republication of something that he had been put on notice that the person thought it
[02:26:19.360 --> 02:26:25.120]   was defamatory and so that's what happened this craziness is going on what have you heard about
[02:26:25.120 --> 02:26:34.720]   Pimmelgate? No. So in Hamburg, a person tweeted at a politician calling him a "Pimmel", which
[02:26:34.720 --> 02:26:43.880]   is a way to say somewhat politely, Dick. So Polish-- I'm going to remember, "Pimmel is polite
[02:26:43.880 --> 02:26:50.680]   for Dick." I'm going to use that. Pimmel? You, Pimmel? You, Pimmel? Do, Pimmel. Do,
[02:26:50.680 --> 02:26:57.880]   Pimmel? Do, Pimmel? Do, Pimmel? Do, Pimmel? Do, Pimmel? Yeah. So the police searched
[02:26:57.880 --> 02:27:01.320]   the place where they thought this person lived. In fact, they didn't live there, went
[02:27:01.320 --> 02:27:07.000]   elsewhere. And so, you know, it's against the law in Jourine de Rene's Salty Paul edition.
[02:27:07.000 --> 02:27:15.320]   This is getting to be insane. Oh, that's crazy. This is insane. That's crazy. But I don't--
[02:27:15.320 --> 02:27:21.200]   This is-- Where was the judge? This is the-- It's Circuit-- 8th Circuit? Oh, my God.
[02:27:21.200 --> 02:27:25.120]   This is the-- I tweeted a whole bunch of links to it. Because why would something that's
[02:27:25.120 --> 02:27:30.440]   not defamatory in a newspaper be suddenly defamatory because it's in a tweet? I don't.
[02:27:30.440 --> 02:27:35.840]   That's really interesting. I'd like to see the doctrine there. Yeah. So I just thought
[02:27:35.840 --> 02:27:39.880]   that would be an interest to our little audience as we say farewell for another week. So if
[02:27:39.880 --> 02:27:46.760]   you-- folks, just as a point of order, if you feel like a news article is insulting or
[02:27:46.760 --> 02:27:52.520]   defamatory, don't sue the newspaper. Wait until they tweet it.
[02:27:52.520 --> 02:27:57.880]   Dan, you got him. That is-- Of course they rarely do. And no one's half the battle. That's
[02:27:57.880 --> 02:28:01.880]   a crazy doctrine. I'd like to know more about that. We'll read more of that. We'll talk
[02:28:01.880 --> 02:28:13.440]   about it next week. Ant, Ant, Pruitt. Not quite. So close. What is on hands-on photography
[02:28:13.440 --> 02:28:20.120]   these days? This week we're going to do some feedback. I've gotten a particular question
[02:28:20.120 --> 02:28:25.000]   that comes up over and over and over again. And we're going to share it. I'm not going
