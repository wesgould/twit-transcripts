[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   Ant Proit is here in his barn apparently.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   I can't. Good to see you.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   Welcome to Strad.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   Hello.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   Hello Ant.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   That is a good look. I'll tell you. I like that better than the white background.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   That's nice.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   Did you build that yourself?
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   Yeah, I figured since this is now where my roots are going to be set, I might as well just start chopping wood and putting stuff together.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   That's it. Build that up. Get the boys in there.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Ideas.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   The hard heads can hammer with their heads.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   That's right.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   That's Jeff Jarvis. He is the 10 out of 10 award winning.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   Rate my Skype room professor.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   Also, we must say the Leonard Towel professor for journalistic innovation at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   I should have done that in my David Attenborough voice from last week.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   That one was good. Next time I'll do that.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   And all the way from the beautiful Pacific Northwest where she still has power even though Jeff doesn't.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   It's Stacy Higginbotham. Hello, Steve.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   Was Jeff, you don't have power?
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   No.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   We're on generator.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   Oh.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   It's a tree.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   It's a tree.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   It's a tree.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   It's a tree.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   The storm.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   No one could pronounce.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   What was it? Isaiah?
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   No, was I you got it?
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   I can't remember.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   Is say it is the I.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   Is I.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   Is I.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   The third syllable has the emphasis.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   It's I.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   Is I.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   Is I.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   Is I.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   Is I.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   Is hurricane.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   It's a really real name, actually.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   It is.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   It is.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   It's going to come back in five years.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   A lot of people complain.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   I.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   Is.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   So.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   You said you have breaking news as we come on the air that you're not breaking wind anymore.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   No, I'm not going to do that.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   No, no, don't leave me on.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   But do you like my avocado shirt?
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   That's very nice.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   Look at that.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   Is that yes?
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   Is that yes?
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   That sounds right.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   I think that's right.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   Yes.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   Okay.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   Sorry.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   I like your avocado shirt.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   I noticed it right away.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   And I was like, thank you.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   Leo has gone casual.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   I want to thank.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   Where does one get an avocado shirt?
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   Sam Miguel, the I.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   And they Mexico.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   This is from.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   I love said Miguel.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   And they.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   Next time you down there go to a Brazos designs.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   And I'll tell you.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   A process hug.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   Hug.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   Very good.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   And they do.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   You could actually online in a Brazos San Miguel dot com.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   And they make these.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   I have many of these shirts.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   Thanks to our listener, Wynton Churchill, who sends me these from time to time.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   He also sent me.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   Oh.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   Avocado mask.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   Look at you.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   Look at you.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   This confirms what I have been thinking all along, which is that in the new world, masks
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   will be a fashion statement and you will have a mask that matches your.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   Co-tute.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   Nancy Pelosi already does that.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   Yeah, I noticed.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   So it's really nice.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   It's not nice.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   I sent Kirsten the.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   The matching bow tie and mask.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   We're seeing a lot of clever mass designs.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   Might as well if you're going to wear them might as well have them look good, right?
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   There's a mask prize.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   There's an X prize for designing the best mask a million dollars.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   This was recently announced like an hour ago.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   X prize.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   Did y'all see this?
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   I think our Jamer B.R.U.V. mask that we just bought on Kickstarter for a ridiculous amount
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   of money should definitely win the Xbox.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   Xbox X prize.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   Look at that.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   They've raised $2.3 million.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   Wow.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   Still nine days to go.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   It's not too late.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   This has inside meat UV mask.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   The next generation reusable mask with powerful UBC purification technology.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   It's like you got oats in there.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   But no, it's actually got a little vortex that the air goes in and out through and it's lit by UV light.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   So it's actually getting sterilized.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   How well there's you have to have a certain amount of coverage and length of time.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   I know.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   That's why it's a vortex.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   How how heavy is this?
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   We won't know.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   What's the cost here?
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   A hundred bucks.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   A hundred smackers.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   It has a lithium ion battery in it because it's active.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   And so does it make noise like a laptop?
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   Yeah.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   Shh.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   I don't know.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   I don't know.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   But I am.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   John bought this first and I said, John, you can't have it if I can't have it.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   So I bought one too.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   Of course.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   So.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   I'm with Mrs. Stacy, though.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   How much does it weigh?
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   That's what I'd like to know.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   Well, so it's kick starters.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   You're going to get it after we have the vaccine.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   Yeah, they say October, 2020.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   Yeah, no, no, we're not going to get it for years.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   But you know what?
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   I think it'll be kind of like something for the Smithsonian, right?
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   Along with your own.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   It will be indicative of the time.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   It is indicative of the time.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   So anyway, that's going to be that's going to that should win the X prize, don't you think?
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   Forget foggy glasses.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   Yeah, because it's like a fan.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   That's going to be way too.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   I mean, like anything on my face or my head trigger migraines.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   So I'm like, oh, you can't do it.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   In fact, you probably do you hate masks in general?
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   I don't know.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   I mean, they're very useful.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   They can't be tight.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   They can't be tight on you probably.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   They're right.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   I mean, they do what they do.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   I don't wear them for that long because I'm never, you know, you're not going to local bar.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   I want to create you go to the sea cup.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   Yeah, that's like that.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   I wish they said what the weight was as to 1,800 milliamp hour batteries.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   So that by itself, that's half a pound right there, I think.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   It's going to weigh something.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   You're going to know you're wearing a light and a fan in it.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   Yeah, there's a lot of luck going on.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   There's a lot going on.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   I wish they had it.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   I just had an idea for Carson.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   I'm going to make him famous.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   Since he's in a mask instead of rate my Skype room, you could have a site of rate my COVID mask.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   Well, we are doing Carson's mask of the week.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   You know that.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   Right.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   But no, he could do a whole site.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   Everybody who's on TV can get a screenshot.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   He can be called.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   Oh, the rate my mask man.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   I get on Twitter.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   Hey, did you get a strange security message on your Twitter today?
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   I sure did, sir.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   Don't know why.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   Who else got it?
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   You got it.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   I was on my desktop like I normally am when I'm checking out Twitter.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   I just got it.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   We recently discovered a security issue in Android OS 8 or 9.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   Can you show this that could have impacted you?
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   Our understanding is 96% of people using Twitter for Android already have an Android security
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   patch installed that protects them from this vulnerability.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   Since you are no, I'm on Linux.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   Since you are no longer using a vulnerable version of Twitter for Android on this device,
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   you don't need to do anything.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   We felt it was important to let you know.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   I'm scared the pants off of you.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   You know, you launched Twitter on my Android device.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   I didn't get anything on my phone.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   That's what I was going to say is I use it on my phone from time to time and I didn't get a thing on there.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   I did.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   It says I'm not, but are you using to use the official Twitter app?
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   Yes, sir.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   So bizarre, right?
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   Anyway, I guess that's a word of warning for everybody.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   We need to go question the teenagers in Florida.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   My question is what exactly happened?
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   Yeah, Twitter ain't going to tell you that.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   Maybe you see it gets in.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   I'll tell us next week.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   Yeah, I think there are.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   Aren't there laws now disclosure laws?
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   I know there are for privacy breaches, for security breaches.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   They don't have to tell you.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   I mean, they just have to say.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   We were briefly.
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   Well, they do actually have to tell you what data was breached if they know.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   Let's go to the privacy.Twitter.com website.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   Twitter for Android security vulnerability.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   We don't have evidence this vulnerability was exploited by hackers.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   They're just going to be careful as hell now.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   Well, I don't blame them.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   No.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   It's actually, they're pointing at Android.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   They're saying it affects Android 8 and 9.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   It's an underlying Android OS security issue.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   Well, they know you've used Android because right now you're on the web.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   Yeah, that's interesting.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   They must know I have used it or they're just.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   Well, they know who you are.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   I mean, they know you're logging in from your account and whatever device.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   I wasn't having a moral panic, don't worry.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   Oh, I was like, just make sense.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   This time.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   This is from the.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   Where's it?
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   I need to high five you October.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   October 2018.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   Android security vulnerability in the framework that could enable a real
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   remote attacker using a specially crafted file to execute arbitrary code within the context
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   of a privileged process.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   That's as bad as bad as you could get.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   That means they could essentially take over your family.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   That's 2018.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   Yeah, that was almost two or two years ago.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   That's why it's eight and nine.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   Okay.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   Well, critical vulnerability, but you've updated by now.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   Surely.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   You have to wonder if this is a little bit of security theater.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   They just want to say, look, we're on top of everything now.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   We're doing our best.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   After Kirk, we're not taking any chances.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   We were wondering why the, by the way, the kid who perpetrated this crime, did we mention
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   this yet?
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   No, I think not.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   I think this happened since last week.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   A 17 year old just graduated high school from Tampa, Florida.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   I don't want to say his name because he is a minor, even though he will be tried as an adult.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   For 30, count them 30 felonies for the Twitter hack.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   He had two accomplices and he's a troubled kid.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   It's a tragic story, really.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   Yeah.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   Yeah.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   The Twitter social engineering, that is.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   So, yeah, the social engineering.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   And we also, I think from the indictment, have a better idea of what happened.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.560]   Remember we said that he was able to get these Slack credentials, rather the Twitter God
[00:12:54.560 --> 00:13:00.000]   mode credentials from Slack, which he got into, we don't know how, but it had two factor
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   on it.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   Ooh.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   Good on you, Twitter.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   So, he called Twitter employees posing as Twitter security.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   I can imagine the call going something like, hello.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   This is Twitter security.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   But we seem to be having a problem with our authentication servers.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   I just want to verify, could you open your two factor for your God mode app?
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   And are you getting the ID 602134?
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   Oh, no, I'm not.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   What are you getting?
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   1-83642.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   Oh, crap.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   Okay.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   Well, we're going to go fix that.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   Bye.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   Something like that.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   That's a, that's a dramatization.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   Thanks for the fish.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   Yeah.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.160]   He had two accomplices, one in the UK, another one who was from California, but is in, was
[00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:53.120]   in Florida at the moment.
[00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:57.880]   One was 22, another one was, I think 17 or 18.
[00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:06.280]   It's, yeah, you know, a lot of us, a lot of the people I've talked to, I won't name names
[00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:08.400]   somewhat privately, mostly.
[00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:11.160]   But people in my business, geeks, hackers.
[00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:15.160]   They go, yeah, well, I did things like that when I was a kid.
[00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:17.160]   Maybe not quite so.
[00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:27.560]   Pubrazon and brazen, but it's not unusual for teenagers to try to push the boundaries.
[00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:32.440]   And then the New York Times had a story on him and how he was mean.
[00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:34.760]   He was mean to other kids.
[00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:38.680]   And apparently he always trying to scam him out of small amounts of money and stuff like
[00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:39.680]   that.
[00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:40.680]   So I feel bad.
[00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:43.920]   I know I'm not going to name his name because, A, it's just an indictment.
[00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:48.040]   It's alleged he hasn't been convicted and B, he's a minor.
[00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:49.960]   Although it wouldn't be hard to find his name.
[00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:53.560]   It was every equalist everywhere, which I think I agree.
[00:14:53.560 --> 00:14:55.720]   I think that's good of you.
[00:14:55.720 --> 00:15:01.600]   Isn't that the kind of the journalistic thing is you don't say the name of minors.
[00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:08.160]   When all of this started, when all of this came, came down, one of the hard heads comes
[00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:09.160]   running downstairs.
[00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:13.080]   He's like, you were talking about the Twitter hack on our group chat.
[00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:15.000]   And it was a teenager.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:18.560]   And I tried to explain to him that it was social engineering.
[00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:23.120]   And this is why all of these previous years when we're out in public together as a family
[00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:28.120]   and people are asking us questions, I lie, I lie through my teeth.
[00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:32.640]   And they always look my kids, but always looking me in the face like, that's not right, dad.
[00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:37.960]   You know, just I'm like, no, I'm lying through my teeth on purpose because people can just
[00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:43.120]   skim information, you know, over time and use it against you.
[00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:44.640]   Okay, let's try this.
[00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:45.640]   Oh, man.
[00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:47.720]   Oh, sir, where were you born?
[00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:49.520]   I was born in Johannesburg.
[00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:52.920]   You need an accent for that.
[00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:53.920]   Oh, no.
[00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:56.160]   He has much the wrong one.
[00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:59.200]   And your father's maiden name?
[00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:00.200]   Not yours.
[00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:01.200]   None.
[00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:02.200]   Yeah.
[00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:06.720]   Yeah, and a one shrewd Lou.
[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:08.120]   Yeah, and one shirt Lou.
[00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:10.000]   There you go.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:16.520]   Good article in I think ZD net had the most Caitlin Simpano from zero day on ZD net had
[00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:23.840]   the very best kind of breakdown of the hack with all of the information and all of the,
[00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:26.280]   you know, these are the the discourse.
[00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:29.560]   I'm sorry, the discord conversations.
[00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:32.760]   Kirk, who is the 17 year old saying, I work for Twitter.
[00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:34.560]   I can claim any at for you.
[00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:36.000]   Let me know.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:37.760]   Don't tell anyone.
[00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:41.520]   And then one of the accomplices code named Rolex.
[00:16:41.520 --> 00:16:44.600]   LOL, prove it.
[00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:48.480]   Give me your Twitter at I'll pull it up.
[00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:51.080]   Vienna cat 921.
[00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:52.080]   That's yours.
[00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:53.080]   Yeah.
[00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:58.080]   And of course he then proves he has God mode because he does something changes or tweets,
[00:16:58.080 --> 00:17:00.760]   he changes a password or tweets in his name.
[00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:06.440]   So Rolex said, Oh, dude, let me introduce you to ever so anxious.
[00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:10.920]   Kirk puts the Bitcoin address that we all know and love so very much.
[00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:11.920]   Yeah.
[00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:15.440]   And says, send your Bitcoin to this address 5k.
[00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:19.360]   I'll give you three OG user names.
[00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:27.040]   Guy wants at vampire at X, X and at dark.
[00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:36.000]   But earlier, you could tell he's a kid because Kirk says Rolex says, I'm going to say $1,000
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.400]   minimum cool.
[00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:38.400]   Yeah.
[00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:43.960]   And then he puts a link up on OG users.com, which is where people trade these OG names.
[00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:45.680]   I put one K minimum.
[00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:52.800]   Let's say that for non OG, how about $2.5, $200, $2,500 for OG?
[00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:56.600]   Oh, no, $1,000 for all is fine.
[00:17:56.600 --> 00:18:01.600]   All right.
[00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:07.160]   So little, a sec problem though here all along.
[00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:12.960]   For one thing, they shared the user names in various places on the OG users account.
[00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:16.320]   By the way, that was breached a couple of years ago.
[00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:22.560]   So the FBI had a data dump of all the accounts on OG users, including IP addresses.
[00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:26.520]   So they were able to cross reference that with the discourse handle, same handle.
[00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:32.560]   But the real mistake was when he registered that Bitcoin address, he did a Coinbase, which
[00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:42.520]   requires a picture of your driver's license, which he used to small detail, little thing.
[00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:44.520]   So this is teenagers.
[00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:46.240]   They never think anything through.
[00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:47.240]   They're just dumb.
[00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:48.240]   Yeah.
[00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:50.680]   I chose these not a master criminal mastermind.
[00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:51.680]   Yeah.
[00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:52.680]   So he should.
[00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:54.960]   I mean, honestly, what's going on here?
[00:18:54.960 --> 00:18:58.600]   Dumb kids should not be tried like a sparko cam.
[00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:00.880]   Whatever that is, is taken over.
[00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:02.240]   Doesn't sound real.
[00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:04.000]   I wouldn't give it your home address.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.920]   So is Twitter all the more humiliated that they got, they got owned by a dumb teenager,
[00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:10.560]   not by a state actor?
[00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:12.080]   Well, they're not nobody.
[00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:15.560]   Everybody's saying, well, this guy was a mastermind, brilliant criminal.
[00:19:15.560 --> 00:19:19.240]   Well, you know, we got, we nabbed him.
[00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:24.040]   But all of them use their, their real world driver's licenses to verify their Twitter
[00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:26.840]   has to be embarrassed even more, I would think.
[00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:27.840]   I would feel.
[00:19:27.840 --> 00:19:30.840]   I mean, this is, this is just, this happens.
[00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:31.840]   I don't know.
[00:19:31.840 --> 00:19:32.840]   I don't think they'd be honest.
[00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:33.840]   Yeah, I know.
[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:39.560]   But you know, North Korea uses all its resources to get you as a little cooler than a Pimply
[00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:40.960]   Fizz Kid in Florida.
[00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:41.960]   Yeah.
[00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:42.960]   Yeah.
[00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:47.960]   It was a nation state, 17 year old nation state from Florida.
[00:19:47.960 --> 00:19:50.160]   So anyway, busted.
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:55.440]   And I think honestly, yeah, the fact that he had such poor operational security, I mean,
[00:19:55.440 --> 00:20:01.280]   using your real driver's license to register the Bitcoin address, it's pretty much saying,
[00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:02.280]   catch me.
[00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:03.280]   Right?
[00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:04.280]   Yeah.
[00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:08.080]   Pure ignorance on it all.
[00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:09.720]   Or ignorance or whatever.
[00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:11.120]   Yeah, he just doesn't know.
[00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:15.760]   19 year old in UK, 22 year old in Orlando also charged.
[00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:20.080]   Obviously, all of these will be plea deals.
[00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:22.160]   I don't know whether they'll do time.
[00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:26.680]   They are trying the 17 year old Kirk as an adult.
[00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:31.520]   What's what's what's a just outcome here?
[00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:33.120]   You know what often happens with these guys?
[00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:39.040]   I think of people like Kevin Midnick, Kevin Paul, Adrian Lammo, they almost always do
[00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:40.040]   some time.
[00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:45.040]   I don't think that's a good idea because that's honestly the best way to learn criminal
[00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:46.920]   practices is to do it.
[00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:49.400]   Yeah, you can actually use it to steal a lot of money.
[00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:50.400]   Yeah.
[00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:52.800]   But they often do serve some small amount of time.
[00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:55.400]   And then in the case of Kevin Midnick.
[00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:56.400]   They get a movie.
[00:20:56.400 --> 00:21:01.480]   Yeah, he was for first he was forbidden from using the internet for a period of time after
[00:21:01.480 --> 00:21:02.480]   his release.
[00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:04.120]   I don't remember how long Kevin did it was.
[00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:05.240]   I feel like it was a year and a half.
[00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:07.480]   I know he lived on tuna fish.
[00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:08.480]   He did the time.
[00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:10.560]   He was a young guy.
[00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:13.240]   Crimes, you know, roughly the same as these.
[00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:14.800]   Very similar.
[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:17.960]   He scammed radio station contests.
[00:21:17.960 --> 00:21:22.080]   Then he got out, then he got a job and security, which is often what happens with these guys.
[00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:28.160]   Kevin Paul says, now a journalist, but often what happens is they get offered a job.
[00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:33.280]   And I think sometimes that's, by the way, not unusual that that's the hope of these young
[00:21:33.280 --> 00:21:37.080]   guys is, oh, you know, look, I'll show how sharp I am.
[00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:42.920]   Aid poor Adrian Lammo, who I, you know, honestly don't think he had a mean bone in his body.
[00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:45.880]   He was never tried to make money on his hacks.
[00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:51.560]   I think he was honestly just trying to get a job as a pen tester, but he got the book
[00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:52.520]   thrown at him.
[00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:58.640]   So, you know, I mean, I don't think hacking Twitter is a great thing, but there's a little
[00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:00.640]   bit of culpability on Twitter's part.
[00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:01.840]   That should not have been easy.
[00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:06.080]   In fact, former Twitter employees have said that there's as many as a thousand people had
[00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:08.920]   access to that God-moted ministry of tuna.
[00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:12.360]   That's a thousand way too many.
[00:22:12.360 --> 00:22:13.360]   That's a lot of people.
[00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:14.680]   That doesn't make me feel great.
[00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:17.880]   I mean, I don't send information via DMs anyway.
[00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:22.600]   I'm like, hey, let's use signal, let's go to voice, let's do anything that is not, you
[00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:23.600]   know.
[00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:24.600]   Yeah.
[00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:32.200]   Actually, I'm now reading also by Katelyn Champano from Zero Day that that Twitter exploit you
[00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:37.880]   and I just saw the upshot of his, it grants access to DMs.
[00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:38.880]   Oh.
[00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:45.360]   So, but please don't use DMs on Twitter for anything you wouldn't want the world to see.
[00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:47.160]   That's just nuts.
[00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:54.240]   Kirk did download now Twitter saying, initially, remember I said eight DMs from eight accounts.
[00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:59.200]   I think you ended up being 36, something like that, much larger number.
[00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:01.040]   But I don't think you was a, you know.
[00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:04.440]   So I have a question for you.
[00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:08.760]   On signal, I get messages that, oh, your friend Stacy is on signal.
[00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:10.240]   Yeah, I don't like that.
[00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:11.240]   Yeah, I never.
[00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:15.160]   I mentioned her wife and she was appalled for something that's supposed to be heavy insecurity.
[00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:16.720]   So how does that work?
[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:22.360]   The thing that happens with signal is you are connected to it through your phone number,
[00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:28.320]   which a lot of people think is a bad idea because that's a real world connection to
[00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:30.160]   a real person.
[00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:33.960]   A lot of people use burner numbers to get around this, but you ultimately, it needs
[00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:37.080]   to be a number that you can get a text message on.
[00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:41.680]   And that's, that's problem one, but problem two.
[00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:45.520]   And you wouldn't, you had to give permission, I believe, when you first installed signal
[00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:50.520]   is it will then do what every other app does, which is download your contact list.
[00:23:50.520 --> 00:23:51.520]   Shake your contacts.
[00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:53.640]   Yeah, but just say no.
[00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:54.640]   I mean, like I said, no to that.
[00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:55.720]   You will get those notices.
[00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:56.720]   Yeah.
[00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:57.720]   Yeah.
[00:23:57.720 --> 00:24:02.800]   So I think it's a big mistake for signal to do that.
[00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:08.320]   Signal has been talking about replacing the phone number with another system with a pin,
[00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:10.120]   but does have to be a unique identifier.
[00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:12.320]   So that's the, that's the trick.
[00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:13.320]   Right.
[00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:14.320]   Yeah.
[00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:15.680]   It's kind of off brand for signal.
[00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:22.680]   It is off brand, but so that's an interesting question is, you know, and there's always a
[00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:24.600]   trade off between security and convenience.
[00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:27.920]   And in this case, Signal said, well, there's some people want this.
[00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:29.960]   We want to be more like a messaging program.
[00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:34.920]   We want people to use it.
[00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:38.160]   Let's take a break and then we'll talk about the Samsung already.
[00:24:38.160 --> 00:24:39.160]   Already.
[00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:41.000]   I have so many commercials today.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:42.840]   Oh, that's such a good news.
[00:24:42.840 --> 00:24:45.000]   Oh, and I'm so excited to talk about Samsung.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   Yes.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   Okay.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   Oh good.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   Oh good.
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   I already put my order in.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:51.000]   I'm curious.
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   Did you put an order in?
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   Don't say what?
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   No.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   Okay.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   Sorry.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   You could just say whether you did or not, but I will talk about it in just a second.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:02.840]   And Jason Howell and I got up very early, 7 a.m. Pacific time this morning to cover it.
[00:25:02.840 --> 00:25:04.840]   That's not early for me.
[00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:05.840]   Yes.
[00:25:05.840 --> 00:25:09.040]   Have you seen this guy get started in the week?
[00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:10.280]   Is he grumpy?
[00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:12.680]   Is he really grumpy?
[00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:14.200]   It's not grumpy.
[00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:15.880]   It's definitely not motivated either.
[00:25:15.880 --> 00:25:18.120]   Yeah, it's a little bit slow.
[00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:21.800]   But I had to get up even earlier than that because I had to set up the lights and the
[00:25:21.800 --> 00:25:23.040]   cameras and all that stuff.
[00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:26.320]   So, you know, I got up at 6.15.
[00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:27.320]   It's pretty early for me.
[00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:28.320]   Oh, poor you.
[00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:29.320]   That's early.
[00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:32.800]   Actually, on Wednesdays, I have a Pilates class at 6.15 every week.
[00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:34.800]   So it isn't early at all.
[00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:38.120]   But I like to play it off.
[00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:40.720]   Our show today brought to you by Zip Recruiter.
[00:25:40.720 --> 00:25:43.400]   Yeah, they're people hiring.
[00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:45.040]   There are.
[00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:46.040]   And I think that's a good thing.
[00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:50.080]   I want to encourage you and I want to also make sure that if you are hiring, you use the
[00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:54.680]   best tool in the world, the one we use Zip Recruiter.
[00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:57.720]   Everything is hard because you're hiring, you're building your company.
[00:25:57.720 --> 00:26:01.640]   Those are the people of the company, the building blocks that can make or break your
[00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:02.640]   company.
[00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:08.400]   So you're doing probably the most important job, which is hiring people.
[00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:10.960]   You got new difficulties these days, right?
[00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:18.600]   But Zip Recruiter was kind of made for quarantine because it's all done online.
[00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:20.280]   In fact, it's amazing.
[00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:23.800]   You submit your opening to Zip Recruiter.
[00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:27.360]   They have some really sophisticated matching technology that will look at, they have millions
[00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:29.720]   of resumes on file, current resumes.
[00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:33.920]   They'll look at what they've got on file and they'll match them up and they'll tell the
[00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:35.760]   person, "Hey, we've got an opening over here.
[00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:38.320]   You might be qualified for, you might be interested in."
[00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:39.760]   They apply.
[00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:45.760]   And by the way, when you get applicants at Zip Recruiter, they don't call you.
[00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:47.320]   They don't go on your email.
[00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:50.040]   They all go, it all goes into the Zip Recruiter interface.
[00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:51.280]   They format the resume.
[00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:52.600]   So they're easy to scan.
[00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:54.880]   You can have screen questions.
[00:26:54.880 --> 00:27:00.120]   It makes it really easy to load up a lot of applicants to get all the people in there,
[00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:02.880]   screen out the applicants that just aren't right, narrow it down.
[00:27:02.880 --> 00:27:06.520]   They'll even highlight the best applicants automatically for you so you can find the
[00:27:06.520 --> 00:27:07.920]   right person fast.
[00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:09.120]   Perfect example, housing wire.
[00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:14.600]   You'll like this, Jeff, because housing wire was looking for a reporter to cover news stories
[00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:17.640]   in the US housing markets.
[00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:18.640]   Hard thing to do right now.
[00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:21.240]   You know, you're not going to put an ad in the paper and have people come to the office.
[00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:22.240]   Can't be paper.
[00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:23.240]   What's a paper?
[00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:24.240]   What's a word?
[00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:25.240]   Yeah, really.
[00:27:25.240 --> 00:27:26.840]   Yeah, good point.
[00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:28.160]   So you got a Zip Recruiter, right?
[00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:29.160]   That's what they did.
[00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:30.160]   And that's how they found it.
[00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:31.160]   It's a nice story.
[00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:32.640]   Alexander Roja.
[00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:35.600]   She figured, "I'm not going to get a reporter job.
[00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:37.760]   I'm just going to have to wait till COVID is over."
[00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:38.760]   Nope.
[00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:39.760]   But she did do the right thing.
[00:27:39.760 --> 00:27:44.880]   In fact, I told my daughter and my son both, she created a profile on Zip Recruiter.
[00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:47.560]   Zip Recruiter's automatic matching.
[00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:53.240]   She looked at Alexandra's degree and her writing skills, looked at the Housing Wire's
[00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:58.200]   reporter job, and they said, "Alexandra, you should apply.
[00:27:58.200 --> 00:28:03.240]   Housing Wire got her application four hours after they posted the job, and as often happens,
[00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:07.360]   they looked at it, and a few weeks later, Alexandra is working at Housing Wire."
[00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:09.760]   I'm making a note right now for my son.
[00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:10.760]   Yeah.
[00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:11.760]   Oh, I made sure.
[00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:14.600]   That's the first thing I did, as I made sure my kids were on there.
[00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:17.400]   Let's Zip Recruiter help you hire.
[00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:19.520]   We have done it ourselves many times.
[00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:20.880]   We've hired from Zip Recruiter.
[00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:24.480]   I'll never forget Lisa going, "Oh, somebody quit in the first thing in the morning."
[00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:25.960]   She's going, "Oh, now I got a...
[00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:26.960]   Oh, man."
[00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:28.640]   I said, "Look, Zip Recruiter's breakfast.
[00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:29.640]   We're sitting at breakfast."
[00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:30.640]   She puts the...
[00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:31.640]   How early?
[00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:32.640]   How early was breakfast?
[00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:33.640]   6.15 AM.
[00:28:33.640 --> 00:28:36.640]   It was probably around 8.
[00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:37.960]   We're having breakfast.
[00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:39.840]   She says, "What's it in?"
[00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:41.640]   Within an hour or two, she starts getting up.
[00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:42.880]   She says, "This person's good.
[00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:43.880]   She starts getting applicants."
[00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:47.200]   I said, "But on lunch, you had three or four really qualified people.
[00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:49.080]   We filled that job fast.
[00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:52.280]   That's why we love Zip Recruiter.
[00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:55.520]   Four out of five employers who post on Zip Recruiter, you get quality candidates within
[00:28:55.520 --> 00:28:57.720]   the first day.
[00:28:57.720 --> 00:28:58.720]   Try it now.

[00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:07.640]   No wonder they call Zip Recruiter the smartest way to hire.
[00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:11.480]   And I like it that my avocado shirt matches the Zip Recruiter logo.
[00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:14.560]   I am Zip Recruiter.
[00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:17.720]   Ziprecruiter.com/twig.
[00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:22.200]   Thank you, Zip Recruiter, for your support during this tough time.
[00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:24.240]   Thank you, dear listener, for supporting us.
[00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:28.200]   It was a very wonderful sign for the economy that they're advertising right now.
[00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:29.200]   Absolutely.
[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:31.880]   That means that people need to hire.
[00:29:31.880 --> 00:29:32.880]   You're hired.
[00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:33.880]   Yeah, too.
[00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:37.280]   That's a good leading indicator.
[00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:41.400]   We're actually starting to see advertising dollars come back into the market.
[00:29:41.400 --> 00:29:46.000]   Some of it's B2C, business to consumer, like the Casper's of the world.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:50.280]   And some of it, a lot more of it is B2B, enterprise stuff.
[00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:51.280]   We're starting to do it.
[00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:54.160]   I think that's partly because it's a twit.
[00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:58.000]   Because where else are you going to reach tech savvy?
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:01.600]   They can't be sponsors of conferences anymore.
[00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:02.600]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:04.600]   There's all that sort of way.
[00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:05.600]   It's not your region.
[00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:07.400]   It's almost at Stacy's Conference, of course.
[00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:11.360]   Well, but Stacy, you're finding sponsors too easily, right?
[00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:14.720]   Actually, we are almost sold out for the year and we're already booking into February
[00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:15.720]   of next year.
[00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:16.720]   Wow.
[00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:17.720]   Yeah.
[00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:18.720]   I know.
[00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:24.720]   So I wonder whether there are new Casper's and new Harry's because of COVID.
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:28.920]   Are there things that people just aren't going to go to the store for anymore that created
[00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:29.920]   a new opportunity, I wonder.
[00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:31.480]   Well, I see a ton of mass.
[00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:32.480]   Above ground pools.
[00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:33.480]   Yeah.
[00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:34.480]   Mass cats are all.
[00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:36.240]   Yeah, that's a good one.
[00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:38.400]   Yeah, there are a few things, aren't they?
[00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:40.840]   I mean, we've talked about this ever since.
[00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:47.360]   By the way, 141 days since we went into shelter in place here in California since March 17th.
[00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:51.560]   We from that day forward started talking about what is this going to look like when
[00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:53.040]   we come out of this?
[00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:55.000]   How is the world going to change?
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:57.600]   And you're really starting to see some big changes.
[00:30:57.600 --> 00:30:59.720]   Didn't Duncan just announce that?
[00:30:59.720 --> 00:31:00.720]   800 stores.
[00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:01.720]   800.
[00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:05.080]   And are those closed for good?
[00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:06.720]   I think so.
[00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:09.680]   8% of its US locations.
[00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:13.440]   That sounds not so bad, but 800 sounds like a lot of people.
[00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:17.280]   My Bank of America is all around us.
[00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:19.840]   Not even by appointment or the open.
[00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:23.040]   And so I'm guessing that they're trying to figure out whether they can close a whole
[00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:25.360]   mess of offices, that's a guess.
[00:31:25.360 --> 00:31:29.840]   And when you see Duncan doing this, what you're seeing is them trying to belt tighten.
[00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:30.840]   Yep.
[00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:33.800]   They've been keeping up with rents, but you know, you're paying rent for something you
[00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:35.120]   keep doesn't generate any revenue.
[00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:38.320]   They're belt tightening so that they can survive.
[00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:42.160]   And you know, I think part of what's happening is this is we saw this last week when CES
[00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:45.280]   finally said, yeah, you know, we're not going to do see.
[00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:46.440]   It takes a while.
[00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:48.920]   It's taking a while for people to get.
[00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:51.560]   This isn't going to be over in a month or two.
[00:31:51.560 --> 00:31:52.560]   Right.
[00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:53.560]   People.
[00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:56.440]   Well, you know, nobody wants to admit things like this, right?
[00:31:56.440 --> 00:31:59.800]   You don't want to be like, Oh, we're going to be here for the next year and a half, but
[00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:01.800]   we're finally having to accept that.
[00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:02.800]   It sucks.
[00:32:02.800 --> 00:32:06.440]   I got a question for you, Leo.
[00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:10.200]   Do you because this is now Zane up to Viscuit written about this in the Atlantic.
[00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:12.280]   It's the next after test trace isolate.
[00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:15.960]   The next important thing is ventilate, ventilate, ventilate.
[00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:19.600]   Do you have any control over the outside air into your studio offices?
[00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:21.360]   Is that something you have to adjust or something?
[00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:23.840]   It does worry me.
[00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:24.840]   This is a big unknown.
[00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:28.920]   I haven't read what Zane up wrote, but this is a big unknown because we do know that
[00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:33.160]   air conditioning spread it in at least one case, China, right?
[00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:39.040]   So, but and I, and I've been trying to figure out what, what are the filters?
[00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:40.040]   What are the, what is it?
[00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:41.040]   The Herve scale.
[00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:42.040]   What are the Herve?
[00:32:42.040 --> 00:32:45.200]   Like not her, but something like that.
[00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:46.200]   Yes.
[00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:47.200]   Merve.
[00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:48.200]   Merve.
[00:32:48.200 --> 00:32:52.280]   My dear boy, Mervin, the Merv scale.
[00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:54.560]   What is the minimum that you would need?
[00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:59.640]   And nobody will say, because we don't know.
[00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:01.640]   So it's like it's not like they're being rude.
[00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:02.640]   They're just, they don't know.
[00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:05.680]   One of the things we're doing is we're really reducing the number of people who are in
[00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:06.680]   studio.
[00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:08.120]   There are very few people who actually can come in here.
[00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:10.960]   Ant, you needed a piece of equipment.
[00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:14.600]   We put it off the front door so that you can come pick it up without coming in.
[00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:18.160]   So that's one way we're doing that is just really reducing the number of people in here.
[00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:22.200]   We also have these molecules in here, which do some, you know, an air purifier.
[00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:24.040]   We'll get some of it.
[00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:25.040]   I just unknown.
[00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:26.040]   I don't know.
[00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:30.320]   And you know, we're keeping social distance, wearing, I wear masks everywhere, but in my
[00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:32.320]   studio and here.
[00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:33.320]   It's very difficult.
[00:33:33.320 --> 00:33:34.320]   It really is.
[00:33:34.320 --> 00:33:35.320]   I just put a link up.
[00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:37.480]   I just put a link up to the independent.
[00:33:37.480 --> 00:33:40.560]   This is that air conditioning units that recirculate air in rooms and offices should
[00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:45.560]   be turned off or used only with open windows.
[00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:48.480]   Okay.
[00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:49.560]   But is, who's that from?
[00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:50.560]   Filters.
[00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:53.680]   The independent, it's on, it's on the rundown.
[00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:59.200]   It was linked to by one of my favorite experts among my many experts, Debbie Sridar, who's
[00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:03.160]   the expert who made Scotland work while the UK didn't.
[00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:05.320]   So I trust if she linked to it.
[00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:09.840]   The WHO said coronavirus can spread through tiny droplets of the air at close spaces.
[00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:10.840]   Yeah, we knew that.
[00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:11.840]   Okay.
[00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:15.440]   The UK Health and Safety Executive says the risk of air conditioning spreading coronavirus
[00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:17.520]   in the workplace is extremely low.
[00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:20.800]   As long as there is an adequate supply of fresh air and ventilation.
[00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:24.520]   But ads, if you use a centralized ventilation system that removes and circulates air into
[00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:28.560]   different rooms, it is recommended you turn off recirculation and use a fresh air supply.
[00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:34.000]   If you have that, I see, I see, I don't think this is a recirc.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:35.240]   I don't think this is recirc.
[00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:36.160]   I think we're getting it.
[00:34:36.160 --> 00:34:37.160]   I don't know.
[00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:38.160]   I don't know.
[00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:39.160]   My school too.
[00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:40.160]   Yeah.
[00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:41.160]   We're.
[00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:42.160]   Yeah.
[00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:44.840]   Opening a window so there's the best thing you can do, but we're like many offices.
[00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:45.840]   We're sealed.
[00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:46.840]   Yeah.
[00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:47.840]   Yeah.
[00:34:47.840 --> 00:34:49.680]   So I, yeah.
[00:34:49.680 --> 00:34:54.240]   And I also, I don't want to jump the gun because we've gotten all sorts of conflicting
[00:34:54.240 --> 00:35:00.280]   advice, like look at all the schools that are, you know, taking a day to deep sanitize
[00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:02.840]   everything before the next class comes in.
[00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:05.880]   And now there's some concern I just saw a piece in the Atlantic saying this is just
[00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:12.120]   security theater or antivirus theater that it doesn't look like surfaces are really the
[00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:13.120]   problem.
[00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:14.120]   It's air.
[00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:15.760]   So I just don't know.
[00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:17.000]   I just don't know.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:18.800]   Nobody knows.
[00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:19.800]   Yikes.
[00:35:19.800 --> 00:35:20.800]   Yikes.
[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:21.800]   Yikes.
[00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:25.160]   We'll just do our best to stay healthy, right?
[00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:28.400]   You were talking about CES being canceled.
[00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:34.000]   I'm curious about the contracts with the likes of CES and all of the relationships they
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   have with the different hotels.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   Don't they buy Wimbledon?
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   I think so.
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   Wimbledon.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   I think so.
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   Wimbledon was the only tennis tournament that had insurance that covered a pandemic.
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   Okay.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   But for them?
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   But the others didn't.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   Interesting.
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:55.000]   The Atlantic today.
[00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   They've been doing great coverage.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   I love the Atlantic.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   I pay for it because I love them.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   That's so came here.
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:09.320]   Inuology is where intuition goes to die.
[00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:11.400]   This is Ed Young who's great.
[00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:12.400]   I love his stuff.
[00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:14.300]   It's brilliant.
[00:36:14.300 --> 00:36:16.240]   This is his lead.
[00:36:16.240 --> 00:36:20.960]   He says there's a joke about immunology with Jessica Metcalf of Princeton recently.
[00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:24.640]   He told me an immunologist and a cardiologist are kidnapped.
[00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:29.080]   The kidnappers threatened to shoot one of them but promised to spare whoever has made
[00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:32.120]   the greater contribution to humanity.
[00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:36.760]   The cardiologist says, well, I've identified drugs that have saved the lives of millions
[00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:38.320]   of people.
[00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:41.320]   Impress the kidnappers turn to the immunologist.
[00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:42.320]   What have you done?
[00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:47.200]   They asked the immunologist says, the thing is the immune system is very complicated and
[00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:50.800]   the cardiologist says, just shoot me now.
[00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:58.680]   Ed Young's tweet, the origin of the story is one of my colleagues asked for an immunity
[00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:00.920]   explainer and I said, God no.
[00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:03.560]   Have you had any idea how complicated immunology is?
[00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:04.560]   That would kill me.
[00:37:04.560 --> 00:37:08.480]   But then I realized I'm already dead inside and I wrote the piece.
[00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:15.120]   I just want to say that Ed Young wrote probably the most important piece I've read to date.
[00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:20.400]   On are you handling in the United States of the COVID crisis?
[00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:24.440]   It's kind of amazing that a couple of days after he releases this, I don't know, 10,000
[00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:25.440]   word pieces.
[00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:26.440]   He's got another article already.
[00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:27.440]   The guy is insane.
[00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:28.440]   He's amazing.
[00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:31.640]   But this is the one I actually don't recommend.
[00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:33.400]   I've not passed it around.
[00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:39.120]   It's too damn depressing how the pandemic defeated America but it is very well written,
[00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:40.120]   very well researched.
[00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:41.120]   How did he interviews?
[00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:42.120]   He did.
[00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:43.320]   Brilliant guy.
[00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:46.200]   This is perhaps the most important article.
[00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:50.120]   Not about the pandemic in general but about our handling of it here in the United States.
[00:37:50.120 --> 00:37:56.040]   And the cracks that it exposed in our society.
[00:37:56.040 --> 00:38:02.280]   Anyway, Samsung Galaxy on pack.
[00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:06.400]   I thought we were talking about gadgets and not bringing us all down again.
[00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:10.000]   That's why I don't send that link around because it's depressing.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:14.200]   So this morning, early morning, got up very excited.
[00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:15.960]   I did it from the house because I thought it would be easier.
[00:38:15.960 --> 00:38:17.440]   I wouldn't have to put on bands.
[00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:20.080]   Jason Howell joined me from his house.
[00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:21.960]   They were a little late.
[00:38:21.960 --> 00:38:23.800]   Part of it was live as best we could tell.
[00:38:23.800 --> 00:38:25.920]   A lot of it was prerecorded.
[00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:30.880]   The biggest takeaway from me, and I'm curious what you thought, Stacy, you can sound like
[00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:36.280]   you are more excited about this, was how little technical detail.
[00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:39.680]   They never once measured, mentioned the processor.
[00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:42.400]   They barely mentioned the size of the batteries.
[00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:45.240]   They didn't talk about the cameras, the megapixels.
[00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:49.360]   They left almost all the technical specs out.
[00:38:49.360 --> 00:38:55.840]   They announced two new Galaxy Note phones, the Note 20 and Note 20 Ultra.
[00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:58.520]   They announced a new Galaxy Watch.
[00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:01.320]   They announced new Galaxy Buds.
[00:39:01.320 --> 00:39:06.160]   They announced a new Note tab, a Galaxy tab.
[00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:14.760]   They announced the new folding phone, but left out all the details.
[00:39:14.760 --> 00:39:19.240]   Maybe because it all had been leaked or they knew that the embargoed reviews would be out
[00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:21.040]   right after the event.
[00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:26.160]   It was disappointing to me because it was, and maybe this is a COVID thing because obviously
[00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:30.320]   this would have, reporters would have been there in years gone by.
[00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:36.880]   This was just a big ad with a lot of soft, mushy marketing terms for how wonderful the
[00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:39.640]   life would be using their stuff.
[00:39:39.640 --> 00:39:45.360]   I felt like we have Apple pioneered this with tech reporters going to their lunches.
[00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:49.440]   I feel like this is just the end of that COVID has pushed that.
[00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:59.840]   I think it's probably right to do so because for years these events have been for two purposes.
[00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:05.880]   One, reporters to get our coverage, but also to get pretty pictures and live blogs and
[00:40:05.880 --> 00:40:10.120]   page views and whatever, speeding the machine.
[00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:15.440]   Then your diehard fans and developers would also check in, but they weren't necessarily
[00:40:15.440 --> 00:40:20.680]   there to talk about processing power or megapixels or what.
[00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:26.120]   I think maybe they aired too far in the giant ad side, but I think this is where we had
[00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:33.160]   been heading and COVID has changed the audience for these two normal people, not just reporters.
[00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:35.040]   That's exactly what I was thinking.
[00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:41.640]   Samsung has done an amazing job of cornering the market of the regular person.
[00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:46.360]   Number two, manufacturer in the world after Huawei and in Apple.
[00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:52.000]   You grab a regular person on the street that has a Samsung device that could care less
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:54.040]   what the SOC is.
[00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:58.680]   They just want to make sure that camera makes them look really good when they're in the club.
[00:40:58.680 --> 00:41:00.720]   That's it.
[00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:03.320]   Of course, I always look really good in the club.
[00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:04.320]   Me too.
[00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:05.320]   Yeah.
[00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:06.320]   But...
[00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:07.400]   In your avocado shirt.
[00:41:07.400 --> 00:41:13.680]   I haven't been in the club in 40 years probably, but okay.
[00:41:13.680 --> 00:41:19.520]   I think also it reflects the fact that we're at peak phone, that we are now, every technology
[00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:23.360]   gets to this point where speeds and fees just don't matter anymore.
[00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:27.720]   You assume it's going to have a great camera, it's going to have a great screen.
[00:41:27.720 --> 00:41:30.040]   It's a note, so it's going to have a stylus.
[00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:32.400]   You don't sweat the details.
[00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:36.560]   In fact, they spent more time talking about the color Mystic Bronze.
[00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:38.360]   Because that's what sales.
[00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:40.480]   Then yeah, that's what people want.
[00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:41.880]   So that's what I want to buy.
[00:41:41.880 --> 00:41:44.600]   I want that beautiful rose gold beans.
[00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:45.600]   There's just so adorable.
[00:41:45.600 --> 00:41:48.680]   Oh, are you talking about the new earbuds?
[00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:49.680]   Yes.
[00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:53.200]   I'm going to get everything in bronze.
[00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:56.320]   I'm going to bronze all the things.
[00:41:56.320 --> 00:41:58.200]   It's just so pretty.
[00:41:58.200 --> 00:42:01.440]   So here's what I don't, so are you going to order one of these?
[00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:03.200]   No, I don't.
[00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:05.040]   I'm not fancy.
[00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:08.120]   Although the flip phone, I got to say, you want to be fancy.
[00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:10.280]   Yeah, no, they are never new one.
[00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:14.320]   I'm like, I would, I would totally, that is like, give it to me.
[00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:15.880]   And now it's going to be a Scottie,
[00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:20.240]   Mystic Bronze $799.99 and 99 cents.
[00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:21.240]   And now I'm fine.
[00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:26.920]   I feel like my next phone, even though I'm right or die for, you know, pixel, I'm looking
[00:42:26.920 --> 00:42:30.840]   at that and I'm like, yeah, yeah, baby.
[00:42:30.840 --> 00:42:31.840]   Yeah, baby.
[00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:33.840]   Yeah, it folds in half.
[00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:35.400]   It's so nice and compact.
[00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:41.080]   I really love this hinge idea where you got a little, it's like a little mini laptop.
[00:42:41.080 --> 00:42:42.720]   You've got a screen on one half of it.
[00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:46.480]   You remember the eye, uh, I pods.
[00:42:46.480 --> 00:42:47.480]   Yeah.
[00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:49.320]   That's about that size.
[00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:50.320]   It's like that size.
[00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:51.320]   I know little screen.
[00:42:51.320 --> 00:42:52.320]   So I think it's me.
[00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:57.600]   You're doing that, by the way, with the new Galaxy Fold as well.
[00:42:57.600 --> 00:43:02.640]   They said that this hinge will also have an infinite angle so that you can do the same
[00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:04.480]   thing.
[00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:10.360]   So the fold, by the way, is going to be a very pricey phone, starting at 1200 bucks.
[00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:14.400]   I, here's what I've after thinking about 1200.
[00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:16.760]   Yeah, I think right.
[00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:17.760]   Here's after.
[00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:19.600]   I thought the fold was more than that.
[00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:21.320]   Well, it goes up 1400.
[00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:23.520]   So maybe it's, I don't know.
[00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:24.520]   Let me learn more.
[00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:28.800]   I got to look again because I have some reason I thought I've reserved it already.
[00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:30.480]   So here's what I, yeah, I know.
[00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:33.760]   I don't care about the price because it's for work, right?
[00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:35.720]   Because I want to do something as an experiment.
[00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:41.280]   One of the things they really were pitching is the, is the Samsung ecosystem.
[00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:42.280]   Everything works better.
[00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:44.720]   This is what Apple says has been saying for years.
[00:43:44.720 --> 00:43:48.800]   Everything works better if you're all Samsung all the time.
[00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:50.000]   So get the fold.
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:51.000]   Get the earbuds.
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:52.560]   Get the watch.
[00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:58.560]   So I think to do it justice, I'm going to have to go all in.
[00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:03.320]   So I, and I thought, well, we haven't really tried any of these folding phones yet.
[00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:06.160]   This is their second and a half generation.
[00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:08.400]   I'm glad the advertising is coming back in.
[00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:09.400]   I know.
[00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:12.240]   We're going to, this is probably, I don't know, it's going a lot of money.
[00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:15.560]   I know as much as a real computer.
[00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:19.120]   But I think I'm going to get, and I'm going to get it all in Mystic Bronze because then
[00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:20.120]   it'll all match.
[00:44:20.120 --> 00:44:23.360]   The bean shaped earbuds, those are hysterical.
[00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:25.080]   Let me see if I can show you those.
[00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:28.480]   Those are so, I want to talk about those because I can't imagine them staying in my ear.
[00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:31.800]   Well, you don't have a bean shaped ear.
[00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:35.160]   More than likely they also come with some additional wings.
[00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:37.480]   Does it have no wings?
[00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:38.920]   No wings.
[00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:39.920]   Look at her.
[00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:42.840]   She's either in great pain or having a good time.
[00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:43.840]   Yeah.
[00:44:43.840 --> 00:44:44.840]   Can't tell.
[00:44:44.840 --> 00:44:45.840]   Does it have the rubber tip or not?
[00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:47.800]   It's like a young Lindsay Lohan.
[00:44:47.800 --> 00:44:48.800]   Look at that.
[00:44:48.800 --> 00:44:49.800]   A lot of freckles.
[00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:51.800]   Yeah, it's got a little rubber tip.
[00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:58.680]   But a lot of the true wireless buds that you see on the market, the ad never shows the
[00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:00.800]   additional tips that comes with them.
[00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:01.800]   Oh, yeah.
[00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:02.800]   They always have tips.
[00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:04.360]   But look at the size of it.
[00:45:04.360 --> 00:45:06.320]   Oh, that tip is so shallow.
[00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:07.320]   It's one.
[00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:09.240]   It's got two drivers in it, it looks like.
[00:45:09.240 --> 00:45:11.640]   Wow, two drivers is pretty cool.
[00:45:11.640 --> 00:45:12.640]   Yeah.
[00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:14.400]   So this is going to be interesting.
[00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:18.280]   They haven't announced, I don't think they've announced a price for these.
[00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:24.080]   The watch, which is pricey, I think it's 400 bucks, is not Android Wear.
[00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:28.600]   And I think this is where Samsung's starting to see some benefits of creating ties in its
[00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:29.920]   own operating system.
[00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:36.600]   I feel like they mentioned, but then had to say a little caveat, not available till we
[00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:38.160]   get FDA approval.
[00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:44.040]   But their new watch will, presuming it gets approved by the FDA, have blood pressure,
[00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:47.160]   have oxygen level, it'd be an oximeter.
[00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:51.600]   Oh, and an electrocardiogram.
[00:45:51.600 --> 00:46:00.160]   Of those three, I think the only one they got FDA approval for was, it was only one.
[00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:02.000]   It would probably be the EKG.
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:05.120]   EKG is pretty established tech.
[00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:06.120]   Yeah.
[00:46:06.120 --> 00:46:07.120]   Yeah.
[00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:09.320]   I can't imagine how it's going to do blood pressure, but you know, some of your watch
[00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:10.320]   is going to go.
[00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:12.440]   No, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:46:12.440 --> 00:46:15.600]   It's just watching your blood flu.
[00:46:15.600 --> 00:46:17.800]   It's probably in the green LEDs, right?
[00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:18.800]   Yeah.
[00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:20.520]   And then just running an algorithm.
[00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:23.120]   That's, I mean, it's probably not very accurate either, right?
[00:46:23.120 --> 00:46:25.120]   Yeah, those are only as good as their algorithm.
[00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:26.120]   Right.
[00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:31.360]   I was looking at my job, and I think what it is, is you have to, you'll do the twist
[00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:32.600]   when you put it in, right?
[00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:33.600]   Yeah.
[00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:34.600]   Yeah.
[00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:37.360]   And the bean shape, they say is because that's your ear canal.
[00:46:37.360 --> 00:46:38.360]   Yeah.
[00:46:38.360 --> 00:46:39.360]   It's kind of bean life.
[00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:40.360]   I just have weird ears.
[00:46:40.360 --> 00:46:43.160]   I can't, I cannot wear any of the Apple things.
[00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:45.080]   They just fall straight up.
[00:46:45.080 --> 00:46:46.080]   Yeah.
[00:46:46.080 --> 00:46:48.080]   Well, this may not be for you.
[00:46:48.080 --> 00:46:50.520]   Anyway, I thought-
[00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:52.240]   Still waiting for Google to fix theirs.
[00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:54.480]   I thought I would get all of the above.
[00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:55.560]   Kevin is watching it.
[00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:58.680]   He sent me a footnote on the Samsung phone prices.
[00:46:58.680 --> 00:47:03.200]   He said those prices include a phone trade-in, so you paid $200 to $400 more over the listed
[00:47:03.200 --> 00:47:04.200]   price without the drink.
[00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:05.200]   Whoa.
[00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:06.200]   So if you have an old note-
[00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:07.200]   There is a-
[00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:09.080]   You can trade it in for the new one.
[00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:10.080]   And one of the things they do offer-
[00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:11.080]   They don't listen to you, price.
[00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:13.400]   Are they only for zooming the trade-in?
[00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:14.400]   No.
[00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:15.600]   I don't know.
[00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:18.880]   I got a quote that didn't say you have to trade it and you can't-
[00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:20.120]   You can't if you want.
[00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:24.880]   The other thing they say is you get a 50% return if you return it anytime in the first
[00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:26.840]   two years in good shape.
[00:47:26.840 --> 00:47:31.000]   So you could in two years buy a new one and get a 50% back.
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:33.240]   So they're pushing this ecosystem.
[00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:37.640]   They want people to live in Samsung land.
[00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:39.640]   The same way people live in the Apple world.
[00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:40.640]   Yeah.
[00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:41.640]   Is that same thing?
[00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:45.080]   One of the ways they're doing that is they're really promoting this DEX thing.
[00:47:45.080 --> 00:47:50.000]   Remember DEX was a little thing where you dock your phone and you'd-
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:54.280]   To a keyboard, mouse and monitor and you'd get kind of desktop applications.
[00:47:54.280 --> 00:47:55.280]   They're doing that again.
[00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:57.480]   They're doing it wirelessly this time.
[00:47:57.480 --> 00:48:02.040]   And they're doing it with Microsoft in the Your Phone app on Windows 10.
[00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:10.040]   So you can get some integration, you know, some sort of desktop integration using DEX
[00:48:10.040 --> 00:48:12.120]   and using your phone on Windows 10.
[00:48:12.120 --> 00:48:14.600]   It's interesting.
[00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:18.840]   You know, Samsung is doing the best it can given that they're not Apple and they're not
[00:48:18.840 --> 00:48:22.080]   Google.
[00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:27.960]   The problem that I have that would keep me from buying like the tab is what they call
[00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:28.960]   the tab.
[00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:29.960]   Tab is seven.
[00:48:29.960 --> 00:48:30.960]   Yeah.
[00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:34.640]   That thing looks really, really good from a spec sheet standpoint.
[00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:37.240]   iPad Pro competitor ish.
[00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:39.880]   Set this a lot cheaper, right?
[00:48:39.880 --> 00:48:47.480]   But the ecosystem, the apps, the where iPad Pro wins is there are so many great apps on
[00:48:47.480 --> 00:48:52.760]   there for everybody, not just the productivity people, but also the creators too.
[00:48:52.760 --> 00:48:59.960]   If you look at this S7 and S7+, it actually looks a lot more like a Surface Pro.
[00:48:59.960 --> 00:49:03.440]   It's got a kickstand, it has a keyboard with a trackpad.
[00:49:03.440 --> 00:49:05.200]   Surface, yeah.
[00:49:05.200 --> 00:49:11.520]   They didn't talk about price, but I think this is not going to be much less than an iPad.
[00:49:11.520 --> 00:49:13.440]   iPad Pro starts at a thousand bucks.
[00:49:13.440 --> 00:49:15.960]   So is this seven inches or they're causing S7?
[00:49:15.960 --> 00:49:20.880]   There's a seven and they're rather 11 and a 12.4.
[00:49:20.880 --> 00:49:22.120]   I love my $6.7.
[00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:23.120]   I love my $6.7.
[00:49:23.120 --> 00:49:28.600]   When it goes on sale, the S7+849.
[00:49:28.600 --> 00:49:31.800]   Those are pretty close to iPad Pro prices.
[00:49:31.800 --> 00:49:35.360]   I don't know about my Nexus 7.
[00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:37.080]   Android tablets are a non-starter.
[00:49:37.080 --> 00:49:39.760]   In fact, that's one of the reasons they're pushing decks.
[00:49:39.760 --> 00:49:45.840]   They're pushing windows, an interface with your phone.
[00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:51.520]   I don't really see a market particularly.
[00:49:51.520 --> 00:49:53.520]   You know, compared to the iPad.
[00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:54.520]   Jeff is the market.
[00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:57.640]   No, no, he doesn't want an Android tablet.
[00:49:57.640 --> 00:49:58.640]   Do you really?
[00:49:58.640 --> 00:49:59.640]   Oh, no.
[00:49:59.640 --> 00:50:00.640]   I love the part to have a solar.
[00:50:00.640 --> 00:50:01.640]   It's a seven inch.
[00:50:01.640 --> 00:50:06.640]   Samsung makes up sure they make a seven inch.
[00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:08.840]   I think it's the lowest one is an eight, I think.
[00:50:08.840 --> 00:50:09.840]   Is it?
[00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:10.840]   I don't know.
[00:50:10.840 --> 00:50:11.840]   I can be wrong.
[00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:14.280]   Why 7 versus eight?
[00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:16.280]   Is it pocket of billions?
[00:50:16.280 --> 00:50:17.280]   My pockets?
[00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:19.560]   It was a good hand size.
[00:50:19.560 --> 00:50:22.280]   It was large enough to watch something on an airplane.
[00:50:22.280 --> 00:50:24.280]   I remember those.
[00:50:24.280 --> 00:50:26.480]   But small enough to carry around really easily.
[00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:27.800]   It was a perfect size.
[00:50:27.800 --> 00:50:30.120]   You know who didn't get mentioned at this event?
[00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:31.120]   Mr. Bixby?
[00:50:31.120 --> 00:50:32.120]   Bixby?
[00:50:32.120 --> 00:50:33.120]   No, Bixby.
[00:50:33.120 --> 00:50:44.600]   And in fact, Adam Chair, who was the creator of Siri, and then went on to join Samsung
[00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:47.760]   and do Bixby is now left Samsung.
[00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:48.760]   So I think Bixby might be.
[00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:50.760]   He had a startup called VIV.
[00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:52.160]   VIV, remember VIV?
[00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:53.160]   Yeah.
[00:50:53.160 --> 00:50:56.200]   But VIV was not really a digital assistant from voice.
[00:50:56.200 --> 00:51:01.000]   It was using a voice interface to program web services.
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:02.000]   Right.
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:08.240]   And that's kind of what Bixby became is a way to interface with apps on the phone and
[00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:09.440]   kind of automate that.
[00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:10.920]   And I didn't find it very useful.
[00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:12.280]   The Bixby button is long gone.
[00:51:12.280 --> 00:51:15.400]   I think Bixby is not long for this world.
[00:51:15.400 --> 00:51:21.520]   I still can't quite wrap my head around decks and do use case for that.
[00:51:21.520 --> 00:51:25.200]   Well that's what's changed a little bit because in the early days, the idea was, well, you're
[00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:29.280]   carrying this powerful processor with all your stuff on it.
[00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:30.280]   We got a lot of storage.
[00:51:30.280 --> 00:51:35.360]   Remember they used to say on one of the Galaxy S's, the S8, I guess.
[00:51:35.360 --> 00:51:40.520]   And I bought one that had a terabyte of storage and then you would dock it on the deck stock
[00:51:40.520 --> 00:51:42.520]   and then you'd have a keyboard, mouse, and monitor.
[00:51:42.520 --> 00:51:47.040]   And suddenly, you know, you still have all your stuff, but now you're running desktop
[00:51:47.040 --> 00:51:51.720]   quality applications except they never really were desktop quality applications.
[00:51:51.720 --> 00:51:54.320]   Now you're seeing Microsoft Outlook in there.
[00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:56.240]   You're seeing other Microsoft apps in there.
[00:51:56.240 --> 00:52:03.480]   I think maybe the idea is, decks gives more desktop-like experience to the tablet.
[00:52:03.480 --> 00:52:08.400]   That's more what decks has become than your one computer that you carry with you everywhere.
[00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:09.400]   That's my guess.
[00:52:09.400 --> 00:52:10.400]   Yeah.
[00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:14.320]   It makes more sense with the whole Office 365 package.
[00:52:14.320 --> 00:52:19.840]   There's another reason Bixby might be saying bye-bye because according to the Verge, Google
[00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:26.720]   has been pushing Samsung to push Google Assistant over Bixby.
[00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:31.640]   It doesn't like the fact that Samsung phones come, actually this is from Bloomberg, two
[00:52:31.640 --> 00:52:32.800]   different voice assistants.
[00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:39.040]   Yeah, but didn't Samsung deny these so-called allegations or conversations?
[00:52:39.040 --> 00:52:42.520]   I don't know.
[00:52:42.520 --> 00:52:46.080]   I think it's pretty clear Bixby is no longer a player.
[00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:49.160]   Do you use a Samsung?
[00:52:49.160 --> 00:52:51.320]   No, you use a Samsung.
[00:52:51.320 --> 00:52:53.120]   We all use Bixby now.
[00:52:53.120 --> 00:52:59.680]   I would try the Samsung nowadays because they've gotten much better with their software and
[00:52:59.680 --> 00:53:05.640]   not as much bloat on top of Android as it used to be, but just not really interested
[00:53:05.640 --> 00:53:07.400]   in them.
[00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:12.880]   By the way, according to this story in Bloomberg, this wouldn't be for free.
[00:53:12.880 --> 00:53:19.840]   Google would pay Samsung billions of dollars, perhaps, to use the Assistant instead of Bixby.
[00:53:19.840 --> 00:53:22.400]   I think with Bixby is not long for this world.
[00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:24.440]   I honestly don't think anybody used it.
[00:53:24.440 --> 00:53:25.440]   Bye-bye, Bixby.
[00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:26.440]   Bye-bye, Bixby.
[00:53:26.440 --> 00:53:31.000]   In a related story, Cortana also not long for this world.
[00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:39.760]   It's down to Echo, Google's voice and Siri way, way behind at this point.
[00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:40.760]   So what do you think you get?
[00:53:40.760 --> 00:53:45.000]   Siri could get better fast, though, if Apple just...
[00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:46.000]   Like Apple's...
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:49.920]   I feel like Apple's the kind of company that will one day just be like, "Oh, by the way,
[00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:54.000]   we're giving you an update and now Siri actually understands what you want."
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:56.520]   If it comes from anybody, be Apple, wouldn't it?
[00:53:56.520 --> 00:53:57.520]   Yeah.
[00:53:57.520 --> 00:53:59.520]   More than Google?
[00:53:59.520 --> 00:54:03.280]   Well, you don't see Apple make the incremental steps.
[00:54:03.280 --> 00:54:06.400]   They just suddenly are like, "Boom, we're here," whereas Google will take you through
[00:54:06.400 --> 00:54:08.520]   all the steps.
[00:54:08.520 --> 00:54:10.320]   Here's the reason I agree with you.
[00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:18.160]   It's clearly working really hard on an augmented reality spectacles, and that's going to be 2022
[00:54:18.160 --> 00:54:19.920]   probably.
[00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:22.960]   That's where you would really want a good assistant.
[00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:23.960]   Yeah.
[00:54:23.960 --> 00:54:27.880]   Good voice interaction with somebody who actually understands you.
[00:54:27.880 --> 00:54:28.880]   Because otherwise...
[00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:29.880]   Yeah.
[00:54:29.880 --> 00:54:31.520]   You don't have a keyboard, you don't have a mouse, you just have...
[00:54:31.520 --> 00:54:33.080]   You can look in your voice, that's all you have.
[00:54:33.080 --> 00:54:34.080]   So that's...
[00:54:34.080 --> 00:54:36.560]   And right, if they're going to do that, that's when they do it.
[00:54:36.560 --> 00:54:38.440]   They could be optimizing.
[00:54:38.440 --> 00:54:42.760]   So Amazon and Google both optimized for voice only for a while.
[00:54:42.760 --> 00:54:44.840]   Then Google added displays and...
[00:54:44.840 --> 00:54:47.520]   Or Amazon, I can't remember the order.
[00:54:47.520 --> 00:54:52.840]   But if Apple's thinking, "Well, we're going to do voice and a heads up display together,"
[00:54:52.840 --> 00:54:57.520]   then that changes how you design it and what you optimize for because you're also going
[00:54:57.520 --> 00:55:02.120]   to have to be able to give the computer context clues about when you deliver display versus
[00:55:02.120 --> 00:55:04.120]   a audio response.
[00:55:04.120 --> 00:55:05.120]   So that could...
[00:55:05.120 --> 00:55:07.040]   They're basically trying to do two things in parallel.
[00:55:07.040 --> 00:55:13.280]   And you know how when kids, they grow up to a language, they learn to spell and read a
[00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:17.640]   little bit later because their brains are still learning two different tasks, two different
[00:55:17.640 --> 00:55:18.640]   languages.
[00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:19.640]   Maybe Apple's kind of in that...
[00:55:19.640 --> 00:55:25.920]   Apple is, I think I could tell you from experience because all of Apple's Siri devices have a
[00:55:25.920 --> 00:55:29.440]   screen except for one, which is the HomePod.
[00:55:29.440 --> 00:55:32.800]   And unfortunately, we have a HomePod in our living room.
[00:55:32.800 --> 00:55:35.160]   And it often picks up Siri commands.
[00:55:35.160 --> 00:55:39.800]   And its response is more often than not, "I can't do that because I'm a screen.
[00:55:39.800 --> 00:55:42.240]   Can't help you there.
[00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:45.080]   Ask your phone because I got nothing."
[00:55:45.080 --> 00:55:46.080]   I got nothing.
[00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:47.080]   I got nothing.
[00:55:47.080 --> 00:55:48.080]   I got a speaker.
[00:55:48.080 --> 00:55:49.080]   Yeah.
[00:55:49.080 --> 00:55:55.480]   I think thinking about the Samsung phones and just that whole marketing, uh, spiel that
[00:55:55.480 --> 00:55:59.040]   they sort of presented today, it reminded me of some conversations that I've had with
[00:55:59.040 --> 00:56:04.120]   a couple of hands up photography listeners that's getting these new phones and they're
[00:56:04.120 --> 00:56:08.360]   wanting to know about what apps should I get to make the camera better and make the
[00:56:08.360 --> 00:56:10.520]   camera do this and do that.
[00:56:10.520 --> 00:56:14.640]   And I had to tell them, I said, "You know, nowadays we're pretty much like you said,
[00:56:14.640 --> 00:56:16.960]   Mr. LaPorte, we have peak phone.
[00:56:16.960 --> 00:56:20.960]   Pretty much at peak camera too when it comes to the smartphone camera because of all of
[00:56:20.960 --> 00:56:21.960]   the AI.
[00:56:21.960 --> 00:56:26.200]   A lot of that stuff is just happening right out the back soon as you get the shutter.
[00:56:26.200 --> 00:56:31.320]   It's not much, um, help needed from another third party app nowadays.
[00:56:31.320 --> 00:56:34.120]   It's funny that you should say that because we were talking about that just yesterday
[00:56:34.120 --> 00:56:36.720]   on iOS today as well.
[00:56:36.720 --> 00:56:41.280]   We were talking about what other non-default apps do you use on your iPhone and camera,
[00:56:41.280 --> 00:56:43.440]   of course, is one of them.
[00:56:43.440 --> 00:56:48.880]   And almost every phone I've ever tried, Samsung, Google or Apple, the best app is always going
[00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:50.480]   to be the one from the manufacturer.
[00:56:50.480 --> 00:56:51.480]   The stock.
[00:56:51.480 --> 00:56:54.720]   Yeah, because the stock app is most closely tied to the hardware.
[00:56:54.720 --> 00:56:58.160]   But we also mentioned there are, there are fun, certainly on the iPhone.
[00:56:58.160 --> 00:57:03.920]   There are really interesting and fun third party apps that you would want as for a change
[00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:06.120]   of pace or a different effect.
[00:57:06.120 --> 00:57:12.080]   But both, both Mike and I go right to the stock app except Mike had did mention that
[00:57:12.080 --> 00:57:16.560]   I was at his mom and his sister, I think.
[00:57:16.560 --> 00:57:19.360]   Both, we thought this was weird.
[00:57:19.360 --> 00:57:23.360]   Both use the Snapchat camera as their default camera on their iPhones.
[00:57:23.360 --> 00:57:24.360]   Oh boy.
[00:57:24.360 --> 00:57:25.360]   Oh boy.
[00:57:25.360 --> 00:57:26.360]   Oh boy.
[00:57:26.360 --> 00:57:31.560]   I guess that's just a measure of how all in on the Snapchat there.
[00:57:31.560 --> 00:57:32.560]   Wow.
[00:57:32.560 --> 00:57:35.640]   I do not see a lot of Snapchat users lately.
[00:57:35.640 --> 00:57:36.640]   That's...
[00:57:36.640 --> 00:57:39.640]   Well, we're all moving to TikTok, don't you know?
[00:57:39.640 --> 00:57:41.160]   And TikTok is moving.
[00:57:41.160 --> 00:57:42.960]   Are we going to talk about that?
[00:57:42.960 --> 00:57:45.200]   Yeah, let's take a break and we should talk about that.
[00:57:45.200 --> 00:57:48.320]   Let me just, anything else to wrap up with Samsung?
[00:57:48.320 --> 00:57:53.800]   As I said, when the, it will be September 1, you can order the fold.
[00:57:53.800 --> 00:57:54.800]   It'll be available.
[00:57:54.800 --> 00:58:01.400]   That's September 15th because that's when Microsoft's XCloud gaming platform rolls out
[00:58:01.400 --> 00:58:07.160]   on the, not on iOS, only on Android and it was, they're going to have a special early
[00:58:07.160 --> 00:58:08.760]   partnership with Samsung.
[00:58:08.760 --> 00:58:12.920]   I'm going to bet you that's not just the Note Ultra or Note Plus or whatever they're
[00:58:12.920 --> 00:58:18.000]   calling it, but it will also be on the fold.
[00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:23.400]   Because imagine that 7.6 inch screen gaming on the Microsoft XCloud.
[00:58:23.400 --> 00:58:29.040]   So I'm thinking September 15th, I will, tomorrow I can order the watch and the buds, I'll order
[00:58:29.040 --> 00:58:30.040]   those.
[00:58:30.040 --> 00:58:31.360]   We were going to get all of them.
[00:58:31.360 --> 00:58:37.000]   In fact, there's some Google news too because the Pixel 4a came out on Monday and Jason
[00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:38.640]   gets his tomorrow.
[00:58:38.640 --> 00:58:41.080]   So we knew this would be a kind of crowded period now.
[00:58:41.080 --> 00:58:42.600]   We're going to get a lot of new phones.
[00:58:42.600 --> 00:58:43.600]   The 4a looks really good.
[00:58:43.600 --> 00:58:50.600]   You requested a review unit of the smartwatch for Samsung because I'd like to try it out
[00:58:50.600 --> 00:58:51.600]   for Samsung.
[00:58:51.600 --> 00:58:52.600]   It looks pretty good for wellness.
[00:58:52.600 --> 00:58:54.760]   Yeah, it looks pretty good.
[00:58:54.760 --> 00:58:58.720]   I was a little disappointed after they touted all these heart features to say, well, but
[00:58:58.720 --> 00:59:00.920]   none of them will be available on shit.
[00:59:00.920 --> 00:59:04.000]   You're going to wait until we get approval and all that stuff.
[00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:10.760]   But you know what, for COVID, having oxygen, blood oximeter, for me, blood pressure, I
[00:59:10.760 --> 00:59:15.960]   got to monitor my blood pressure for others with the AFib and ECG.
[00:59:15.960 --> 00:59:19.400]   That's one of the, the ACG is the only one that's on the Apple Watch.
[00:59:19.400 --> 00:59:21.320]   That's a really useful thing.
[00:59:21.320 --> 00:59:25.720]   It looks like Samsung hit all of the key elements that an Apple Watch gives you.
[00:59:25.720 --> 00:59:27.600]   So I can't wait to try it.
[00:59:27.600 --> 00:59:31.880]   It also has a round face and a twisty bezel, which I like.
[00:59:31.880 --> 00:59:34.240]   So I'm going to, you're going to see me.
[00:59:34.240 --> 00:59:35.880]   I'll be mystic bronze for a while.
[00:59:35.880 --> 00:59:36.880]   You're going to be mystic bronze.
[00:59:36.880 --> 00:59:39.960]   You're going to get a mask, a mystic bronze shirt, everything.
[00:59:39.960 --> 00:59:42.200]   It's all mystic bronze from now on.
[00:59:42.200 --> 00:59:44.280]   I think I think you should dye your hair, mystic bronze.
[00:59:44.280 --> 00:59:45.280]   Okay, deal.
[00:59:45.280 --> 00:59:48.280]   I'm going to do it because it is a pretty tall.
[00:59:48.280 --> 00:59:49.280]   Okay.
[00:59:49.280 --> 00:59:51.240]   The shininess is the key to mystic bronze.
[00:59:51.240 --> 00:59:52.640]   It's not going to work for the hair.
[00:59:52.640 --> 00:59:58.360]   Well, if you want to get like Leo's statue paint and like your skin and like stand there.
[00:59:58.360 --> 01:00:04.360]   I would love a hair helmet, you know, shiny bronze hair helmet.
[01:00:04.360 --> 01:00:05.360]   Yeah.
[01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:06.360]   Yeah.
[01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:09.160]   I don't know how they fit you for it though.
[01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:11.560]   That doesn't sound too much fun.
[01:00:11.560 --> 01:00:12.560]   Yes.
[01:00:12.560 --> 01:00:20.040]   Hey, the, the, the, we will, I'm sure on all about Android, I'm thinking next Tuesday, Jason
[01:00:20.040 --> 01:00:21.920]   will for sure have a 4A review.
[01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:24.840]   There are 4A reviews out already.
[01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:25.840]   Very positive.
[01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:28.040]   It looks like, in fact, weren't you thinking about that?
[01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:29.040]   Jeff?
[01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:30.040]   No, no, no, no, no.
[01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:31.040]   I think I'm waiting for a five.
[01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:34.720]   I think I'm about one for Queen Pruitt, actually.
[01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:40.360]   That was so weird that Google announced the 4A and the five at the same time.
[01:00:40.360 --> 01:00:42.640]   It's kind of what the hell there was delayed.
[01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:43.640]   It's all going to be late.
[01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:44.640]   That was coming up.
[01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:46.080]   So okay, here it is guys.
[01:00:46.080 --> 01:00:47.080]   But I do like the price.
[01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:48.080]   What is it?
[01:00:48.080 --> 01:00:49.080]   340, 340?
[01:00:49.080 --> 01:00:51.600]   No, 49 for the, for the 4A.
[01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:53.360]   That's the right price.
[01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:56.120]   So by the way, 128 gigs of storage.
[01:00:56.120 --> 01:00:58.000]   They're not cheaping out.
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:03.320]   Have I bought every imaginable pixel item you can, you can think of?
[01:01:03.320 --> 01:01:04.320]   Yes.
[01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:06.680]   Have I not been a loyal pixel customer?
[01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:07.680]   Yes.
[01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:10.440]   Have I not, I got the Pixel Buds twice.
[01:01:10.440 --> 01:01:11.640]   I have the Pixel both.
[01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:12.680]   I have the Pixel book.
[01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:14.040]   I'm pixeled up.
[01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:15.240]   I am Mr. Pixel.
[01:01:15.240 --> 01:01:16.240]   I am an auditor.
[01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:17.800]   I love Pixel.
[01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:20.200]   Yeah, and chairman.
[01:01:20.200 --> 01:01:23.280]   And Google didn't invite me into the secret Pixel Club.
[01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:24.280]   I'm pissed.
[01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:27.320]   Oh, you don't get the Pixel Club.
[01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:28.320]   Who gets one of the Pixel.
[01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:29.320]   Who gets one of the Pixel.
[01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:30.320]   You are.
[01:01:30.320 --> 01:01:31.320]   Marquez Brownlee.
[01:01:31.320 --> 01:01:32.320]   Right.
[01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:34.480]   Who do you think you are?
[01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:36.520]   You're a secret Pixel Club.
[01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:39.360]   And I don't have the handshake, the Pixel handshake.
[01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:40.680]   And I am pissed.
[01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:45.320]   By the way, all of these Samsung phones have 5G.
[01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:48.120]   Maybe 5G is bigger in South Korea than it is here.
[01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:50.120]   This is because they're ahead of us.
[01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:56.960]   This was good because they do at least explain the two different kinds of 5G, the millimeter
[01:01:56.960 --> 01:02:01.360]   wave and then the sub six wave, which is the one, the only one really that's widespread
[01:02:01.360 --> 01:02:02.360]   use in the US.
[01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:05.680]   That's T-Mobile's using the 600 megahertz band.
[01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:12.080]   Millimeter wave is a very limited use in some areas by Verizon in the US.
[01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:14.240]   But that's got the super wide channels.
[01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:16.240]   Which gives you the amazing bandwidth.
[01:02:16.240 --> 01:02:17.240]   Yeah.
[01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:18.240]   Yeah.
[01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:19.240]   I don't know.
[01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:26.680]   There's actually, there's more 5G coming out in July, early July, the 3GPP approved a
[01:02:26.680 --> 01:02:32.240]   different form of 5G for industrial.
[01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:39.800]   And then next year, well, 18 months from now, there will be 5G, let's see, this is 5G,
[01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:42.280]   NR Lite, new radio Lite.
[01:02:42.280 --> 01:02:47.520]   And that will be an industrial focused one with 100 gigabits per second.
[01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:53.600]   So I called it Goldilocks 5G because it'll be in between the super high data rates and
[01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:56.400]   the super low NBIOT data rates.
[01:02:56.400 --> 01:03:00.840]   Don't you love this video though, the Samsung, dude, this is so much clearer than anything
[01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:02.600]   the carriers want you to know.
[01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:03.600]   Yes.
[01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:06.040]   The millimeter wave bounces off everything.
[01:03:06.040 --> 01:03:08.560]   So it only goes a little ways.
[01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:12.200]   So that's the 5G millimeter wave, but it's super fast.
[01:03:12.200 --> 01:03:17.040]   Then there's the 5G sub six, the 600 megahertz at T-Mobile's using that at least goes through
[01:03:17.040 --> 01:03:18.600]   buildings because of its low frequency.
[01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:24.600]   But it didn't go very far, not as far as LTE, which goes even farther.
[01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:29.760]   So the point being your phone, your new phone will do all three.
[01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:34.560]   And you'll get the good bandwidth if you're in the right spot, the better bandwidth if
[01:03:34.560 --> 01:03:35.560]   you're in the right spot.
[01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:37.280]   And if you aren't, you'll get the 4G LTE.
[01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:39.200]   I thought that was a good explainer.
[01:03:39.200 --> 01:03:41.200]   I haven't explained this to y'all many times.
[01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:42.520]   Yeah, but I understand your talk.
[01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:44.320]   You don't have pretty colored lines.
[01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:46.160]   No, I knew this.
[01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:51.040]   I know it because you explained it, but I just thought this actually commend Samsung.
[01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:55.920]   I didn't even use the word attenuate when I tried to explain it either.
[01:03:55.920 --> 01:04:01.560]   I just commend Samsung because most manufacturers and carriers when you say 5G, they just do
[01:04:01.560 --> 01:04:04.280]   a lot of hand waving and say, don't worry about it.
[01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:06.920]   Don't worry your little pretty little head about it.
[01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:09.840]   So it's nice that Samsung at least says, look, there's different technologies.
[01:04:09.840 --> 01:04:11.080]   They're not all going to work.
[01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:13.720]   They're not all going to be available.
[01:04:13.720 --> 01:04:17.560]   But we got you covered.
[01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:19.040]   She knows this already.
[01:04:19.040 --> 01:04:20.040]   Yeah.
[01:04:20.040 --> 01:04:21.040]   Sorry.
[01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:22.040]   I don't know what's wrong.
[01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:23.720]   I sat in the sun for an hour today.
[01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:24.720]   That was my mistake.
[01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:26.880]   I'm like, OK, take an average so I can get a cup of coffee.
[01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:30.880]   But you got a lot of vitamin D coursing through your veins.
[01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:31.880]   Protecting.
[01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:35.360]   I learned something interesting about pets and vitamin D. It has no relation to the
[01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:36.360]   show.
[01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:38.680]   You know what you're going to say.
[01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:40.280]   It's why they call it oil and licking their hair.
[01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:42.040]   Why they lick their fur so much.
[01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:43.040]   Yes.
[01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:44.040]   Where did we read this?
[01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:45.040]   I don't know.
[01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:46.760]   We must have read the same thing.
[01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:52.240]   But of course, because pets have fur, they can't get vitamin D like humans do through
[01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:53.760]   sun on the skin.
[01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:57.520]   So they secrete an oil with vitamin D, but they got to lick it to get it.
[01:04:57.520 --> 01:04:59.320]   Oh, yeah, they secrete the oil.
[01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:02.360]   Then the sun activates the vitamin D in the oil.
[01:05:02.360 --> 01:05:03.360]   Makes it vitamin D.
[01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:05.360]   So they got a little vitamin D factory on their fur.
[01:05:05.360 --> 01:05:08.400]   Then they go crazy.
[01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:09.960]   I love it.
[01:05:09.960 --> 01:05:12.920]   And I love Leo that we apparently read the same thing.
[01:05:12.920 --> 01:05:13.920]   Same thing, whatever.
[01:05:13.920 --> 01:05:14.920]   I love it.
[01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:18.400]   We're the queen and king of factoid.
[01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:21.400]   Do do do do do do do do do do do do our show today.
[01:05:21.400 --> 01:05:24.880]   I brought to you by those great folks.
[01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:29.600]   As you know, you could see the signs all over the place at last pass.
[01:05:29.600 --> 01:05:31.520]   I love last pass.
[01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:32.520]   And I'll tell you what.
[01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:36.880]   After a business, first of all, you know that people don't do the right thing with passwords.
[01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:37.880]   They make them up.
[01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:38.880]   I had a guy call the radio show.
[01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:41.520]   I have a new scheme for making up my passwords.
[01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:46.720]   I'll replace all the zeros with O's and all the ones with L's.
[01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:50.200]   And I said, dude, the hackers away ahead of you.
[01:05:50.200 --> 01:05:56.960]   What you need is last pass, a password manager that generates long, strong, completely random,
[01:05:56.960 --> 01:06:03.360]   memorable passwords and then stores them securely for you so you don't have to remember them.
[01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:04.440]   Everybody should be using last pass.
[01:06:04.440 --> 01:06:07.880]   I started using it more than 12 years ago when they first came out.
[01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:10.960]   Steve Gibson did his famous breakdown of last pass.
[01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:12.160]   He where he explained it all.
[01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:16.680]   He talked to their creator, Joe Seagrest, got all the deets.
[01:06:16.680 --> 01:06:19.440]   That was a security now episode now 10 years ago.
[01:06:19.440 --> 01:06:21.280]   He's been using it ever since.
[01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:23.440]   We started using it in business five years ago.
[01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:25.640]   And that's really been important for us.
[01:06:25.640 --> 01:06:29.960]   Because not only do individuals do a terrible job with passwords, your employees are doing
[01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:31.840]   a terrible job and they're not just doing it with theirs.
[01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:34.120]   They're doing it with your passwords.
[01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:38.440]   That's why it's so important you get last pass enterprise, especially now that employees
[01:06:38.440 --> 01:06:40.240]   are going home.
[01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:46.520]   Last pass survey, global IT decision makers, 96% of organizations said their remote workforce
[01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:50.880]   has really taken its toll on identity and access management.
[01:06:50.880 --> 01:06:53.440]   They've got to re-strategize.
[01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:57.480]   That's why I say last pass as always.
[01:06:57.480 --> 01:06:59.600]   Of course, secure password storage.
[01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:01.560]   Every employee has their own vault.
[01:07:01.560 --> 01:07:03.840]   So secure, I actually use it for more than passwords.
[01:07:03.840 --> 01:07:08.320]   I keep my passport in there, my driver's license, social security numbers.
[01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:09.720]   It's my secure enclave.
[01:07:09.720 --> 01:07:15.120]   On every device I use, iOS, Android, Mac, Windows, Linux, every browser I use, last pass does
[01:07:15.120 --> 01:07:16.120]   it all.
[01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:19.160]   But it never decrypts that data anywhere but on device.
[01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:24.000]   And it never transmits my master password back to the home office.
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.080]   Only I have access to that stuff.
[01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:30.280]   It's also important because if employees are in different locations, how are they going
[01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:31.280]   to share passwords?
[01:07:31.280 --> 01:07:32.480]   Are they going to get text to them to each other?
[01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:34.760]   Oh, no, that should give you chills.
[01:07:34.760 --> 01:07:37.440]   With last pass, it's built into the app.
[01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:43.160]   They can easily share logins and keep access to corporate data safe.
[01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:44.720]   Logins, by the way, it couldn't be easier.
[01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:47.880]   Every time you create a new credential, it's automatically saved.
[01:07:47.880 --> 01:07:49.520]   It's automatically filled.
[01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:53.600]   That's why it's the first thing I put on all my devices because it saves me time setting
[01:07:53.600 --> 01:07:54.800]   up the device.
[01:07:54.800 --> 01:07:55.880]   All the apps are just used.
[01:07:55.880 --> 01:07:57.880]   Last pass fills it in, logs it in.
[01:07:57.880 --> 01:07:58.800]   It's great.
[01:07:58.800 --> 01:08:03.360]   For your IT department, you'll have policies and actionable insights into employee password
[01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:09.080]   behavior from a beautiful admin dashboard so you'll always know who's doing what where.
[01:08:09.080 --> 01:08:13.280]   And you can ensure that they're being extra secure doing as we do, for instance, turning
[01:08:13.280 --> 01:08:16.160]   on two factor authentication.
[01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:18.360]   It's really easy to add and remove users.
[01:08:18.360 --> 01:08:21.240]   You can even automate user management with directory integration.
[01:08:21.240 --> 01:08:25.520]   Look, no matter where your employees work, they need to keep your stuff safe.
[01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:26.640]   They need last pass.
[01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:29.240]   You need last pass.
[01:08:29.240 --> 01:08:35.320]   Last pass is IAM solutions help businesses improve the employee experience and safeguard
[01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:40.320]   you and your most precious resources, your data from cyber threats.
[01:08:40.320 --> 01:08:44.960]   Let your remote workforce focus on their work without compromising business security.
[01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:46.280]   You got to do what we did.
[01:08:46.280 --> 01:08:50.840]   Some years ago, I'm so glad we did last pass.com/twit.
[01:08:50.840 --> 01:08:51.840]   It's here.
[01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:54.120]   It's ready for the remote workforce and beyond.
[01:08:54.120 --> 01:08:56.640]   Last pass.com/twit.
[01:08:56.640 --> 01:08:57.760]   Thank you, last pass.
[01:08:57.760 --> 01:08:59.000]   They keep the lights on here.
[01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:01.920]   And as you can see, it's quite bright.
[01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:04.840]   Jeff has a generator we have last pass.
[01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:05.840]   Yeah.
[01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:06.840]   Yep.
[01:09:06.840 --> 01:09:08.520]   Although they're both run by gas.
[01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:09.520]   Maybe you didn't know that.
[01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:10.600]   You were speaking of gas.
[01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:12.080]   You said you no longer have it.
[01:09:12.080 --> 01:09:13.080]   Stop it.
[01:09:13.080 --> 01:09:14.760]   I'm eager to hear how you did this.
[01:09:14.760 --> 01:09:19.520]   I have a bean rich diet.
[01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:21.000]   I love beans.
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:22.000]   Right.
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:23.840]   Who doesn't love beans besides my wife?
[01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:25.720]   She didn't love them.
[01:09:25.720 --> 01:09:30.240]   So what I do is I secrete an oil on my fur.
[01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:33.680]   That's long.
[01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:38.320]   Actually there are a number of things I've been trying because I had a bad attack last
[01:09:38.320 --> 01:09:39.320]   week.
[01:09:39.320 --> 01:09:43.160]   And Lisa said, if you don't solve this problem, you're not living here anymore.
[01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:48.120]   So she said that after she said, open all the windows quick.
[01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:52.200]   So first I tried soaking, which works.
[01:09:52.200 --> 01:09:54.400]   But I think it takes some of the flavor out of the beans.
[01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:56.240]   You don't really need to soak beans.
[01:09:56.240 --> 01:09:59.480]   But soaking certainly is changing the water over a period of time.
[01:09:59.480 --> 01:10:02.800]   Definitely helps sprouting the beans, takes out the lectin.
[01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:04.000]   That's another good thing.
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:07.720]   But I found a Mexican herb that they love in Mexico.
[01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:08.720]   Maybe you're familiar.
[01:10:08.720 --> 01:10:09.720]   I bet Stacy knows it.
[01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:10.720]   Eposote.
[01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:11.720]   Oh, yes.
[01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:13.000]   Sometimes called Mexican oregano.
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.120]   It's not a strong flavor.
[01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:17.080]   But apparently, I didn't know this.
[01:10:17.080 --> 01:10:21.880]   One of the reasons it's widely used in Mexican cuisine is it's anti...
[01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:25.000]   See this is a useful tip for your depression ratio.
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:28.240]   Then the other thing, my daughter said, "Dad, just chew your food better."
[01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:30.080]   I said, "Oh, that wouldn't work."
[01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:31.080]   It does.
[01:10:31.080 --> 01:10:32.080]   It does.
[01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:33.080]   It does.
[01:10:33.080 --> 01:10:34.840]   It actually makes a big difference.
[01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:37.160]   So chew your food, use episode A.
[01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:38.640]   I don't like to soak.
[01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:43.720]   I also use combo, which is a Japanese dried seaweed that also supposedly helps.
[01:10:43.720 --> 01:10:46.960]   The other thing I think my gut biome has just gotten used to it now.
[01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:48.360]   Because I love beans.
[01:10:48.360 --> 01:10:50.120]   I mean beans every day now.
[01:10:50.120 --> 01:10:51.120]   I love them.
[01:10:51.120 --> 01:10:52.120]   I am too.
[01:10:52.120 --> 01:10:53.120]   Yeah.
[01:10:53.120 --> 01:10:55.720]   Rancio Gordo, which is the best place to get...
[01:10:55.720 --> 01:10:56.720]   Fancy beans.
[01:10:56.720 --> 01:10:57.720]   Fancy beans.
[01:10:57.720 --> 01:10:59.800]   It's just over the hill here in Napa.
[01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:02.400]   They still, their club is still all booked up.
[01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:03.920]   But I got on the waiting list.
[01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:06.360]   But I did order some beans from there because they're good beans.
[01:11:06.360 --> 01:11:10.840]   They have a lot of heirloom old beans.
[01:11:10.840 --> 01:11:12.320]   There's a bean club?
[01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:13.320]   Yeah.
[01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:14.320]   Oh yeah, the Rancio Gordo.
[01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:15.320]   Oh my gosh.
[01:11:15.320 --> 01:11:16.320]   It's so exclusive.
[01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:17.320]   It is super bougie, man.
[01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:20.640]   It is the bougiest.
[01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:23.760]   There was an article in New Yorker about Rancio Gordo two years ago.
[01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:27.200]   That's actually what made it impossible to get into the club.
[01:11:27.200 --> 01:11:32.400]   But what's cool is this guy goes down in Mexico and convinces the farmers not to plant
[01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:38.120]   the industrialized beans that big egg has been talking them into, but to go back and
[01:11:38.120 --> 01:11:42.880]   plant the beans, their fathers and grandfathers before them grew.
[01:11:42.880 --> 01:11:48.440]   And so they have such exotic and weird and interesting beans.
[01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:49.440]   Some of the...
[01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:50.440]   And they're delicious.
[01:11:50.440 --> 01:11:52.720]   Man, everything is sold out.
[01:11:52.720 --> 01:11:53.720]   Yeah.
[01:11:53.720 --> 01:11:55.480]   They're very popular.
[01:11:55.480 --> 01:11:56.960]   But I did order a bunch of beans.
[01:11:56.960 --> 01:12:02.120]   I think I ordered the cranberry bean and the Ayokot de Murado.
[01:12:02.120 --> 01:12:05.760]   It's a runner, so it's very big and starchy.
[01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:09.960]   But yeah, I don't know why I like beans, but I do.
[01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:11.600]   At least you know why?
[01:12:11.600 --> 01:12:13.160]   Lisa hates them.
[01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:14.160]   I respect that.
[01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:15.160]   I like beans.
[01:12:15.160 --> 01:12:16.160]   Yeah, beans are good.
[01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:17.160]   Like him.
[01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:18.160]   No, he loves beans.
[01:12:18.160 --> 01:12:19.160]   He loves beans.
[01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:20.160]   He does.
[01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:21.160]   Oh.
[01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:22.160]   How do you feel about avocados?
[01:12:22.160 --> 01:12:23.160]   No.
[01:12:23.160 --> 01:12:24.160]   No.
[01:12:24.160 --> 01:12:25.160]   What?
[01:12:25.160 --> 01:12:26.160]   You don't like avocados?
[01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:27.160]   They're okay.
[01:12:27.160 --> 01:12:28.160]   You should move up here.
[01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:29.160]   Avocados are so expensive.
[01:12:29.160 --> 01:12:30.160]   Yeah.
[01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:31.440]   It is like having a drug habit.
[01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:32.440]   Yeah.
[01:12:32.440 --> 01:12:36.400]   Just slice it and maybe put it on a sandwich with some good meat.
[01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:37.400]   There's nothing better than avocado.
[01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:39.160]   I just don't want it by itself.
[01:12:39.160 --> 01:12:40.160]   I love avocados.
[01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:41.160]   No, you stick it.
[01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:43.840]   I mean, I would go ahead.
[01:12:43.840 --> 01:12:48.800]   Oh, I was going to give you my no fail super lazy avocado recipe, which is from when I
[01:12:48.800 --> 01:12:49.800]   was a kid.
[01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:50.800]   I'll take it.
[01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:51.800]   Ritz crackers.
[01:12:51.800 --> 01:12:52.800]   Yeah.
[01:12:52.800 --> 01:12:56.840]   You slice up your avocado into like tiny little, like, you know, normal sized slivers.
[01:12:56.840 --> 01:12:59.280]   A lot of lemon juice, a lot of salt, a lot of pepper.
[01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:00.880]   Pop them on your Ritz cracker and boom.
[01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:01.880]   I used to eat that for dinner.
[01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:05.360]   That is so good and it's good for you.
[01:13:05.360 --> 01:13:06.360]   Except for the real.
[01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:07.660]   My wife is feeling generous.
[01:13:07.660 --> 01:13:09.800]   She makes her favorite sandwich in mine.
[01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:10.800]   Yeah.
[01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:11.800]   Leave us the makings for me.
[01:13:11.800 --> 01:13:13.300]   Just sourdough bread, yeah.
[01:13:13.300 --> 01:13:18.720]   Crisp bacon, nice tomatoes, avocado, little mayo, pepper, it's wonderful.
[01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:20.360]   That's a wonderful.
[01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:21.360]   A.L.T.
[01:13:21.360 --> 01:13:22.360]   Yeah.
[01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:23.360]   Yum.
[01:13:23.360 --> 01:13:24.360]   You put a little lettuce on there.
[01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:27.240]   I made this great salad the other day.
[01:13:27.240 --> 01:13:30.480]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:13:30.480 --> 01:13:31.480]   You have pharaoh.
[01:13:31.480 --> 01:13:32.480]   Love pharaoh.
[01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:33.480]   You have chickpeas.
[01:13:33.480 --> 01:13:34.480]   It's pharaoh.
[01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:35.480]   You make this...
[01:13:35.480 --> 01:13:36.480]   It's a wheat.
[01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:37.480]   It is wheat.
[01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:38.480]   Yeah.
[01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:43.000]   And then you make this marinade with like, it's basically like Caesar dressing.
[01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:48.880]   I think, no, it's like Greek dressing with lots of oregano and dill and feta.
[01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:53.480]   You marinate the beans and the feta and all that in there and then you chop up radishes,
[01:13:53.480 --> 01:13:59.120]   like snow peas, some romaine and avocado and you dump that whole mix lot and you shake
[01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:02.680]   it all around and then you are eating and it is so good.
[01:14:02.680 --> 01:14:03.680]   It is so filling.
[01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:05.160]   It's not a bad salad.
[01:14:05.160 --> 01:14:06.320]   Making me so hungry.
[01:14:06.320 --> 01:14:09.920]   All I had for lunch was beans.
[01:14:09.920 --> 01:14:12.560]   Speaking of Google...
[01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:15.120]   Very good.
[01:14:15.120 --> 01:14:16.920]   This weekend, not at all, Google.
[01:14:16.920 --> 01:14:20.280]   Hey, can we talk about Google A.L.T.?
[01:14:20.280 --> 01:14:21.280]   Google A.L.T.?
[01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:24.640]   That's how you got a really good report, Stacy, that explained it to me.
[01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:25.640]   Oh, yeah.
[01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:33.320]   The A.L.T., which is a very well known security company, is doing a deal with Google.
[01:14:33.320 --> 01:14:34.800]   Obviously Wall Street liked it.
[01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:36.640]   Their stock went up 600%.
[01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:38.520]   I'm sorry, 65%.
[01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:40.720]   Hey, that's a big jump.
[01:14:40.720 --> 01:14:42.360]   Oh, still a big jump.
[01:14:42.360 --> 01:14:44.160]   It was 100% the day of, right?
[01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:51.720]   Yeah, it was a huge jump because Google is putting in $450 million in exchange for a new
[01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:54.680]   class of common stock.
[01:14:54.680 --> 01:14:59.320]   They can't vote on the election appointment or removal of directors, but everything else.
[01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:01.200]   So what does it mean, Stacy?
[01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:03.720]   It's not Google buying A.D.T.
[01:15:03.720 --> 01:15:04.720]   It's buying into...
[01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:05.720]   No, no, no.
[01:15:05.720 --> 01:15:06.720]   It's basically buying...
[01:15:06.720 --> 01:15:14.800]   I look at it as buying the A.D.T. installers, giving Google an install base.
[01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:15.800]   It's also buying...
[01:15:15.800 --> 01:15:16.800]   So smart.
[01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:17.800]   You're right.
[01:15:17.800 --> 01:15:18.800]   Yeah.
[01:15:18.800 --> 01:15:23.400]   It's buying a way to get into the home that isn't selling through their typical Google
[01:15:23.400 --> 01:15:26.240]   store and the retail channels.
[01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:28.600]   And they have tried with Nest.
[01:15:28.600 --> 01:15:30.520]   They have had partnerships.
[01:15:30.520 --> 01:15:34.600]   They actually had individual partnerships and then they switched to one big company nationwide
[01:15:34.600 --> 01:15:35.960]   to install Nest thermostats.
[01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:40.000]   But really, this is like, hey, if we're going to get it on the smart home, it is freaking
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:43.480]   hard to put all this stuff together to make it work.
[01:15:43.480 --> 01:15:46.600]   A.D.T. and for A.D.T.
[01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:47.600]   They have had...
[01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:48.600]   They have modernized.
[01:15:48.600 --> 01:15:49.600]   They get bigger.
[01:15:49.600 --> 01:15:50.600]   Yeah, it helps them modernize.
[01:15:50.600 --> 01:15:51.600]   A.D.T.
[01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:52.600]   with Amazon.
[01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:54.720]   But A.D.T. gets money.
[01:15:54.720 --> 01:15:59.000]   They get the cache of being with Rubbin up with Google.
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:05.720]   And it helps them get in on the smart home without cannibalizing their core business.
[01:16:05.720 --> 01:16:09.920]   And I assume, hopefully, if they did this well, they'll have access to some data that
[01:16:09.920 --> 01:16:14.680]   could help them get with the today's world.
[01:16:14.680 --> 01:16:18.280]   So I think that's for those two companies, what's compelling.
[01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:21.360]   I also think it signals a whole new shift in the smart home.
[01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:24.880]   But do you want to interrupt me and then I'll talk about that afterwards?
[01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:30.600]   I don't know if you'll take one of the challenges to A.D.T. was companies like SimpliSafe are
[01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:31.600]   sponsored.
[01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:37.080]   We're starting to eat their lunch because A.D.T. didn't speak to younger people.
[01:16:37.080 --> 01:16:40.680]   It was from people my age wanted home security.
[01:16:40.680 --> 01:16:43.520]   Younger people, they're moving around more.
[01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:45.360]   They didn't like the idea of an installer.
[01:16:45.360 --> 01:16:47.160]   They're a little more tech savvy.
[01:16:47.160 --> 01:16:49.600]   They want a smarter home.
[01:16:49.600 --> 01:16:52.680]   And so other companies were coming along and A.D.T. was starting to look a little long
[01:16:52.680 --> 01:16:53.680]   in the tooth.
[01:16:53.680 --> 01:16:54.840]   But I didn't think about that.
[01:16:54.840 --> 01:16:56.360]   I think you nailed it.
[01:16:56.360 --> 01:17:02.280]   The partnership, and this is from the Google blog post, the partnership pairs more than
[01:17:02.280 --> 01:17:05.480]   20,000 A.D.T. professionals.
[01:17:05.480 --> 01:17:12.880]   Those are the installers and the consultants who come into your home with Nest's portfolio
[01:17:12.880 --> 01:17:13.880]   of home devices.
[01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:17.840]   They just added a 20,000 person sales force to Nest.
[01:17:17.840 --> 01:17:23.680]   But you made a point about Stacey in terms of the pricing in your post, the pricing of
[01:17:23.680 --> 01:17:26.440]   the A.D.T. hardware versus the Nest hardware.
[01:17:26.440 --> 01:17:27.760]   Talk about that for a second.
[01:17:27.760 --> 01:17:30.320]   How is the staff motivated?
[01:17:30.320 --> 01:17:35.320]   Well, I don't know exactly how, because I'm not privy to the inside details of this.
[01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:42.800]   But A.D.T.'s pricing, their model is you get all the hardware up front and then you pay
[01:17:42.800 --> 01:17:45.360]   it out over the life of the contract, right?
[01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:49.320]   Google actually sells a pretty, their gear is pretty expensive.
[01:17:49.320 --> 01:17:54.320]   So I don't think it's going to derail the commissions of too many of the A.D.T. people,
[01:17:54.320 --> 01:17:58.320]   which is really good, because otherwise they wouldn't want to sell it.
[01:17:58.320 --> 01:18:00.000]   So I think that's the point I made.
[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:01.320]   Was that the point I made?
[01:18:01.320 --> 01:18:03.360]   Well, yeah, there's two questions there.
[01:18:03.360 --> 01:18:07.000]   So one is that Google stops expensive enough that they'll be motivated to sell it.
[01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:11.720]   Then the second question is, will they do this lend lease model with Google hardware
[01:18:11.720 --> 01:18:12.720]   to you think?
[01:18:12.720 --> 01:18:16.280]   Oh, yeah, I don't know.
[01:18:16.280 --> 01:18:18.800]   That is a way to get more people to buy the Google stuff.
[01:18:18.800 --> 01:18:25.560]   And I don't, I kind of doubt it because you do that with a contract and that's something
[01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:26.560]   to look for.
[01:18:26.560 --> 01:18:30.840]   And if you notice so far, they told Reuters that they were only going to do the Wi-Fi,
[01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:33.480]   the thermostat in one other device.
[01:18:33.480 --> 01:18:36.360]   I can't recall at the moment.
[01:18:36.360 --> 01:18:38.400]   So it doesn't compete with their existing portfolio.
[01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:40.040]   It broadens it.
[01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:41.040]   A.D.T.
[01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:42.920]   It does broaden it.
[01:18:42.920 --> 01:18:44.480]   Eventually it will compete.
[01:18:44.480 --> 01:18:49.040]   Now A.D.T. is the monitoring service behind the...
[01:18:49.040 --> 01:18:50.640]   That's the real money.
[01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:54.200]   Well, that's the monitoring service behind Amazon's Echo Guard.
[01:18:54.200 --> 01:18:56.200]   Oh, I know that.
[01:18:56.200 --> 01:19:01.760]   Oh, that's an option for you if you turn on Echo Guard or Madamay's Guard service.
[01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:02.760]   That's not cheap.
[01:19:02.760 --> 01:19:05.640]   I think it's $45 a month the last time I checked.
[01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:09.760]   So I think that's where A.D.T. probably makes most of its money, right?
[01:19:09.760 --> 01:19:11.880]   Yeah, their monitoring service is expensive.
[01:19:11.880 --> 01:19:13.200]   They used to have two versions of it.
[01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:17.360]   They had like a cheaper version for people like me and then they had the old people version
[01:19:17.360 --> 01:19:21.200]   for people like you.
[01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:24.080]   I'm just telling, I mean, that's the market.
[01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:25.080]   So yeah.
[01:19:25.080 --> 01:19:26.080]   Oh, she's cold.
[01:19:26.080 --> 01:19:27.080]   She's cold.
[01:19:27.080 --> 01:19:28.080]   She says it was cold.
[01:19:28.080 --> 01:19:29.080]   Oh, no.
[01:19:29.080 --> 01:19:30.080]   I know that.
[01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:31.080]   It's just true.
[01:19:31.080 --> 01:19:32.080]   She's so cold.
[01:19:32.080 --> 01:19:33.080]   Google posts.
[01:19:33.080 --> 01:19:40.600]   It's first law is really alphabet.
[01:19:40.600 --> 01:19:41.600]   It's first.
[01:19:41.600 --> 01:19:42.960]   It's the cold heart of youth.
[01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:46.320]   First loss in history.
[01:19:46.320 --> 01:19:53.520]   Search revenue dropping for the first time ever in its quarterly results.
[01:19:53.520 --> 01:19:59.160]   We continue to navigate through a difficult global environment, says Ruth Porat.
[01:19:59.160 --> 01:20:00.640]   Wow.
[01:20:00.640 --> 01:20:02.080]   Total revenue for the quarter.
[01:20:02.080 --> 01:20:03.080]   Yeah, it's temporary.
[01:20:03.080 --> 01:20:04.080]   It's COVID, right?
[01:20:04.080 --> 01:20:05.080]   38.3 billion.
[01:20:05.080 --> 01:20:07.880]   Actually, I'm not going to say it's COVID.
[01:20:07.880 --> 01:20:08.880]   It could not.
[01:20:08.880 --> 01:20:13.960]   It could very well not be COVID, but a longer term trend with people moving to Facebook
[01:20:13.960 --> 01:20:16.320]   and other places.
[01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:17.320]   Facebook.
[01:20:17.320 --> 01:20:22.760]   I mean, Facebook ads have to be a pretty competitive with Google ads, don't you think?
[01:20:22.760 --> 01:20:30.120]   Revenue for the quarter was a little more than expected, but a 2% decline from Q2 2019.
[01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:39.360]   That income profit dropped from $9.9 billion a year ago to $6.9.
[01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:44.880]   Search revenue down from $23 to $21 billion.
[01:20:44.880 --> 01:20:46.680]   So tough times.
[01:20:46.680 --> 01:20:49.640]   Now YouTube did a lot better as you'd expect.
[01:20:49.640 --> 01:20:54.840]   Advertising revenue on YouTube was up about $200 million.
[01:20:54.840 --> 01:21:01.240]   Global Cloud also up about 50% from $2.1 to $3.01 billion.
[01:21:01.240 --> 01:21:04.440]   So there are some bright spots in Google.
[01:21:04.440 --> 01:21:09.360]   I was going to ask the YouTube angle and it makes sense that it's up.
[01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:10.360]   Oh, sure.
[01:21:10.360 --> 01:21:11.360]   I'm considering these times.
[01:21:11.360 --> 01:21:16.240]   Well, see, this is the thing because I'd heard also YouTube ad revenue was down for
[01:21:16.240 --> 01:21:18.000]   a lot of creators, right?
[01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:21.040]   You're getting more viewers, but advertisers aren't buying.
[01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:25.200]   This is probably head early in COVID as well.
[01:21:25.200 --> 01:21:29.200]   Well, this is why we go to this one.
[01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:35.600]   The TikTok announcement, so 300 million for European creators, 200 million for US creators,
[01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:37.560]   is really interesting to me.
[01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:42.440]   That's a special fund that they're going to put together.
[01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:45.600]   Before we get to TikTok, because that's going to generate a little bit of conversation,
[01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:46.600]   I'm guessing.
[01:21:46.600 --> 01:21:47.600]   I'm guessing.
[01:21:47.600 --> 01:21:50.000]   I jumped the coin.
[01:21:50.000 --> 01:22:01.200]   Solar Bets, which includes X-Lab, Waymo, Verily, revenue 148 million down from 116 and 2 million
[01:22:01.200 --> 01:22:07.320]   year over year, operating loss of $1.12 billion.
[01:22:07.320 --> 01:22:08.320]   Yikes.
[01:22:08.320 --> 01:22:14.280]   Play Store, non-advertising YouTube revenues up from $4 to $4.5.1 billion.
[01:22:14.280 --> 01:22:18.320]   And Sundar Pachai said YouTube and Google Play subscriptions saw good traction in the
[01:22:18.320 --> 01:22:22.400]   quarter with app and game downloads rising 35%.
[01:22:22.400 --> 01:22:27.240]   That mirrors Apple's big increase as well to quarantine.
[01:22:27.240 --> 01:22:28.760]   So where were they most sensitive?
[01:22:28.760 --> 01:22:29.760]   Was it just search?
[01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:30.760]   Google advertising?
[01:22:30.760 --> 01:22:31.760]   Search.
[01:22:31.760 --> 01:22:32.760]   Search.
[01:22:32.760 --> 01:22:33.760]   Yeah.
[01:22:33.760 --> 01:22:35.760]   But we knew that was going to happen.
[01:22:35.760 --> 01:22:40.480]   I mean, not just for COVID, but we knew that search was always, I mean, that's what Google's
[01:22:40.480 --> 01:22:45.240]   been trying to do is come up with stuff that helps with search because search is going to
[01:22:45.240 --> 01:22:51.320]   naturally decrease as a lot of things change about our world.
[01:22:51.320 --> 01:22:55.480]   The real concern is, is it a trend or is it just COVID?
[01:22:55.480 --> 01:23:00.360]   No, I mean, we're going to be searching more on things like our Echo devices.
[01:23:00.360 --> 01:23:01.360]   I agree.
[01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:04.800]   I mean, so they've seen this coming for years.
[01:23:04.800 --> 01:23:07.160]   Yeah.
[01:23:07.160 --> 01:23:10.840]   By the way, the acquisition of Fitbit is a little bit stalled.
[01:23:10.840 --> 01:23:13.960]   Europe is saying, "Oh, hold on there, Google.
[01:23:13.960 --> 01:23:16.160]   What are you going to do with all that good data?"
[01:23:16.160 --> 01:23:17.160]   Yeah.
[01:23:17.160 --> 01:23:20.600]   Google's like, "We won't use it for advertising because that's what we say to everything."
[01:23:20.600 --> 01:23:22.280]   And that was yesterday's concern.
[01:23:22.280 --> 01:23:23.280]   Yeah.
[01:23:23.280 --> 01:23:28.880]   EU has opened an in-depth investigation to assess the proposed acquisition of Fitbit by Google
[01:23:28.880 --> 01:23:31.840]   under the EU merger regulation.
[01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:34.600]   That could stymie the whole deal.
[01:23:34.600 --> 01:23:37.360]   This seems like they announced this deal a long time ago.
[01:23:37.360 --> 01:23:38.360]   Yeah.
[01:23:38.360 --> 01:23:41.160]   This was last year, but it also was every time anyone writes about it, they write about
[01:23:41.160 --> 01:23:42.720]   it like it's a FAYA complete.
[01:23:42.720 --> 01:23:43.720]   That's right.
[01:23:43.720 --> 01:23:44.720]   That's exactly right.
[01:23:44.720 --> 01:23:45.720]   And I don't understand why.
[01:23:45.720 --> 01:23:46.720]   You had a fit about that last week, yes.
[01:23:46.720 --> 01:23:47.720]   Yeah.
[01:23:47.720 --> 01:23:48.720]   It's not done.
[01:23:48.720 --> 01:23:49.720]   Oh, yeah, I did.
[01:23:49.720 --> 01:23:50.720]   Nothing's happened about it.
[01:23:50.720 --> 01:23:51.720]   I love it.
[01:23:51.720 --> 01:23:52.720]   Well, I think it's not unusual.
[01:23:52.720 --> 01:23:56.600]   We read about the deals and we go, "Oh, they bought Fitbit."
[01:23:56.600 --> 01:23:57.600]   And that's how we say it.
[01:23:57.600 --> 01:24:02.400]   They bought Fitbit, but it hasn't closed and won't closed for a long time, so they didn't
[01:24:02.400 --> 01:24:03.840]   get it yet.
[01:24:03.840 --> 01:24:08.720]   You clearly have not had an editor at a business publication who is like, "This is an announced
[01:24:08.720 --> 01:24:11.160]   deal, not an actual acquisition deal."
[01:24:11.160 --> 01:24:12.160]   Oh, it's good.
[01:24:12.160 --> 01:24:13.160]   So what would you...
[01:24:13.160 --> 01:24:14.160]   What's the headline?
[01:24:14.160 --> 01:24:19.680]   Google, 2x, you always have to have 2x Fitbit or X amount.
[01:24:19.680 --> 01:24:23.200]   And then eventually you have to come through when it's done and say, "The deal is now done."
[01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:24.680]   Got it.
[01:24:24.680 --> 01:24:26.600]   So I'll say that from now on.
[01:24:26.600 --> 01:24:33.080]   Yeah, I used to get confused with "announce versus launched" when I was writing.
[01:24:33.080 --> 01:24:34.080]   Yeah.
[01:24:34.080 --> 01:24:35.080]   Yeah.
[01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:39.320]   I personally think you should never use the phrase "announced" because it's very rare
[01:24:39.320 --> 01:24:42.760]   that real people announce things, right?
[01:24:42.760 --> 01:24:43.760]   So I always just...
[01:24:43.760 --> 01:24:45.520]   Can we say "say" here?
[01:24:45.520 --> 01:24:46.520]   Say.
[01:24:46.520 --> 01:24:47.520]   Yes.
[01:24:47.520 --> 01:24:49.680]   You'd be such a good editor to work for.
[01:24:49.680 --> 01:24:51.400]   I think I would be a little cranky.
[01:24:51.400 --> 01:24:52.400]   I've been...
[01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:53.400]   I've been...
[01:24:53.400 --> 01:24:54.400]   Yeah.
[01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:55.400]   That's why you'd be good.
[01:24:55.400 --> 01:24:56.400]   I had these conversations.
[01:24:56.400 --> 01:24:59.560]   That's why you'd be good.
[01:24:59.560 --> 01:25:03.360]   Hey, did you use Google+,?
[01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:04.360]   I did.
[01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:10.560]   According to the USA Today, you may be owed some money from a class action privacy settlement.
[01:25:10.560 --> 01:25:12.000]   Told you I would pay to use Google+,
[01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:15.360]   $7.5 million settlement.
[01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:18.840]   I don't even think you're going to get the $5 to $12 USA Today's...
[01:25:18.840 --> 01:25:19.840]   It's figured...
[01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:22.200]   It's not going to be worth whatever they're going to make you do.
[01:25:22.200 --> 01:25:25.120]   The truth is, if I wanted to get money, I wouldn't be telling everybody listening to
[01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:34.880]   go to Google+ Data Litigation.com and filling out the forum there so you get your money.
[01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:36.440]   Honey.
[01:25:36.440 --> 01:25:38.800]   But you know, we've all been through these class actions.
[01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:41.320]   So you see how many people make money out of the lawyers?
[01:25:41.320 --> 01:25:43.440]   That's right.
[01:25:43.440 --> 01:25:47.640]   That's another thing the hardhead came running down the stairs to announce to me.
[01:25:47.640 --> 01:25:48.640]   I'm right.
[01:25:48.640 --> 01:25:49.640]   We just set an ounce.
[01:25:49.640 --> 01:25:50.640]   Oh.
[01:25:50.640 --> 01:25:51.640]   See?
[01:25:51.640 --> 01:25:53.040]   He hard-headed an ounce.
[01:25:53.040 --> 01:25:56.280]   He comes down and he's like, "Hey, what is this about?
[01:25:56.280 --> 01:25:57.960]   Class action, action, lawsuit.
[01:25:57.960 --> 01:25:59.520]   What do I need to do to get money?
[01:25:59.520 --> 01:26:01.520]   What are you talking about?"
[01:26:01.520 --> 01:26:04.480]   And I asked him if he knew what Google+ was and he said, "No."
[01:26:04.480 --> 01:26:06.120]   So I said, "Sit down."
[01:26:06.120 --> 01:26:13.120]   I'm rich, Daddy.
[01:26:13.120 --> 01:26:16.040]   I'm rich.
[01:26:16.040 --> 01:26:17.040]   Teenagers.
[01:26:17.040 --> 01:26:18.040]   Wow.
[01:26:18.040 --> 01:26:20.000]   Corey Lewandowski.
[01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:21.000]   Not Corey Lewandowski.
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000]   Yeah, that was all I'm Corey.
[01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:24.000]   I know it.
[01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:25.000]   I was looking the same thing.
[01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.440]   How many Lewandowski's are there in the world?
[01:26:27.440 --> 01:26:30.240]   So Anthony might get a sell next Corey.
[01:26:30.240 --> 01:26:36.840]   He's getting 18 months in prison for stealing Google's self-driving car files.
[01:26:36.840 --> 01:26:40.400]   Who knew industrial espionage was such a big crime?
[01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:47.280]   A US judge yesterday sentenced Anthony Lewandowski to prison.
[01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:54.880]   Remember he was at Google doing in their self-driving unit, left, joined Uber's-- actually
[01:26:54.880 --> 01:27:00.400]   was Otto at the time, the truck unit and Uber eventually acquired them.
[01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:04.520]   Uber sued, I think was 20,000 documents.
[01:27:04.520 --> 01:27:09.600]   I can't remember, but I remember from-- it was a lot of stuff.
[01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:19.600]   And the very famous Judge William Alsop, you may remember from the Microsoft DOJ case,
[01:27:19.600 --> 01:27:24.720]   has sentenced him to a year and a half in prison.
[01:27:24.720 --> 01:27:25.720]   I'm okay with this.
[01:27:25.720 --> 01:27:26.720]   I'm okay with this.
[01:27:26.720 --> 01:27:27.720]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:27:27.720 --> 01:27:28.720]   He was--
[01:27:28.720 --> 01:27:36.400]   I have-- yeah, this was part of this whole Uber cadre of let's not be ethical about anything.
[01:27:36.400 --> 01:27:41.000]   And I'm kind of like, honestly, although I will say compared to the Twitter sentence
[01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:44.920]   for this poor person, I'm kind of like, those are very different.
[01:27:44.920 --> 01:27:45.920]   So we'll see what happens.
[01:27:45.920 --> 01:27:47.720]   I mean, obviously, there's not sentencing yet.
[01:27:47.720 --> 01:27:51.280]   Remember he was a fined a huge amount, $179 million.
[01:27:51.280 --> 01:27:53.360]   Yeah, and he couldn't pay it.
[01:27:53.360 --> 01:27:57.080]   He was filed for bankruptcy.
[01:27:57.080 --> 01:28:04.240]   And the bankruptcy judge is ruling Google asked him to reject Uber's argument that it's
[01:28:04.240 --> 01:28:07.720]   not responsible for the money.
[01:28:07.720 --> 01:28:12.000]   Levandowski now runs a self-driving company called Pronto.
[01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:13.400]   Pronto.
[01:28:13.400 --> 01:28:19.880]   He apologized to Google, said he plans to share his story of regret with others in the tech
[01:28:19.880 --> 01:28:20.880]   industry.
[01:28:20.880 --> 01:28:22.820]   Boy, does he regret it.
[01:28:22.820 --> 01:28:29.440]   Man, he won't have to go to prison till after COVID-19.
[01:28:29.440 --> 01:28:31.720]   It's too dangerous.
[01:28:31.720 --> 01:28:32.720]   He will--
[01:28:32.720 --> 01:28:33.720]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:28:33.720 --> 01:28:34.720]   Yeah, that's interesting.
[01:28:34.720 --> 01:28:38.720]   Yeah, they don't want you to go in there.
[01:28:38.720 --> 01:28:42.320]   All right, are you ready?
[01:28:42.320 --> 01:28:43.320]   For what?
[01:28:43.320 --> 01:28:45.320]   Oh, it's time to TikTok.
[01:28:45.320 --> 01:28:46.320]   Oh, boy.
[01:28:46.320 --> 01:28:47.320]   [SINGING]
[01:28:47.320 --> 01:28:50.320]   Just kill me now.
[01:28:50.320 --> 01:28:55.020]   You.
[01:28:55.020 --> 01:28:58.620]   I have been thinking long and hard about this whole story.
[01:28:58.620 --> 01:29:04.420]   I am now of the strong opinion that there is nothing wrong with TikTok.
[01:29:04.420 --> 01:29:09.900]   It is, I think, one of the most creative, interesting social networks out there.
[01:29:09.900 --> 01:29:13.220]   People are using it very cleverly, very interestingly.
[01:29:13.220 --> 01:29:15.020]   God bless them.
[01:29:15.020 --> 01:29:16.020]   Is this real?
[01:29:16.020 --> 01:29:17.020]   Yes.
[01:29:17.020 --> 01:29:22.220]   I'm not in the least bit concerned about China spying on anybody's TikToks.
[01:29:22.220 --> 01:29:26.120]   In fact, I looked at the iPhone permissions.
[01:29:26.120 --> 01:29:31.220]   Unless you granite permissions to use the microphone and camera, TikTok has no permissions,
[01:29:31.220 --> 01:29:32.220]   including location.
[01:29:32.220 --> 01:29:37.020]   Now, of course, because you're on a cell network, TikTok could see what's on that you're working
[01:29:37.020 --> 01:29:38.020]   on.
[01:29:38.020 --> 01:29:43.720]   So as anybody on a smartphone can see that much, how much use that kind of location,
[01:29:43.720 --> 01:29:49.620]   that kind of not granular location information is used of use to the Chinese government.
[01:29:49.620 --> 01:29:51.020]   I don't know.
[01:29:51.020 --> 01:29:55.320]   I don't think it's a-- I don't actually think it's a security concern at all.
[01:29:55.320 --> 01:30:01.420]   I think that President is mad at TikTok, A, because he's mad at China in general, and
[01:30:01.420 --> 01:30:01.920]   B--
[01:30:01.920 --> 01:30:03.920]   Which is a distraction from Russia, but keep going.
[01:30:03.920 --> 01:30:04.420]   Exactly.
[01:30:04.420 --> 01:30:08.020]   There's all sorts of reasons why he might be calling it the China virus and all that
[01:30:08.020 --> 01:30:09.020]   stuff.
[01:30:09.020 --> 01:30:15.520]   And B, I think he's still pissed off at TikTok because a bunch of TikTok users, and by the
[01:30:15.520 --> 01:30:21.320]   way, K-pop stands, managed to undermine his Tulsa rally by all signing up for tickets
[01:30:21.320 --> 01:30:23.320]   and not showing up.
[01:30:23.320 --> 01:30:27.320]   And I honestly think he's a little butthurt.
[01:30:27.320 --> 01:30:33.120]   And so as a result, TikTok, the president has been saying, in fact, the whole administration,
[01:30:33.120 --> 01:30:38.920]   Mike Pompeo, Peter Navarro, of all been saying, "We're going to ban TikTok," despite
[01:30:38.920 --> 01:30:43.420]   pretty strong questions about whether they could even do that.
[01:30:43.420 --> 01:30:44.620]   Cepheus probably could.
[01:30:44.620 --> 01:30:47.420]   The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.
[01:30:47.420 --> 01:30:49.220]   But Cepheus is not saying anything yet.
[01:30:49.220 --> 01:30:50.620]   They're just investigating.
[01:30:50.620 --> 01:30:54.620]   Wasn't it musically a U.S. company?
[01:30:54.620 --> 01:30:55.620]   Yes.
[01:30:55.620 --> 01:30:56.620]   So they could--
[01:30:56.620 --> 01:31:00.200]   And they were bought by Dansw
[01:31:00.200 --> 01:31:01.220]   That's what Cepheus could intervene in, basically.
[01:31:01.220 --> 01:31:02.220]   Yeah.
[01:31:02.220 --> 01:31:03.220]   That's what they're there for.
[01:31:03.220 --> 01:31:06.420]   Committee for Foreign Investment in the United States.
[01:31:06.420 --> 01:31:09.920]   ByteDance has been at great pains to create a U.S. CEO.
[01:31:09.920 --> 01:31:13.120]   Pup it, according to President Trump.
[01:31:13.120 --> 01:31:15.880]   They say, "We're going to hire 10,000 U.S. people.
[01:31:15.880 --> 01:31:22.320]   The data for U.S. users is stored in the U.S. and Singapore, not in China."
[01:31:22.320 --> 01:31:23.320]   And it's not--
[01:31:23.320 --> 01:31:24.320]   I mean, what is the data anyway?
[01:31:24.320 --> 01:31:26.920]   Now, there's lots of other things to say about TikTok.
[01:31:26.920 --> 01:31:32.120]   You know, for a while, their algorithms seem to ban fat people.
[01:31:32.120 --> 01:31:36.720]   There's a lot of-- there's cultural appropriation going on.
[01:31:36.720 --> 01:31:41.580]   There was actually a really good piece by a black creator on TikTok saying TikTok seems
[01:31:41.580 --> 01:31:43.500]   to be banning black creators.
[01:31:43.500 --> 01:31:50.620]   But they also promote the white creator's use of black music and black culture.
[01:31:50.620 --> 01:31:53.300]   And so that's a little bit-- that sketch.
[01:31:53.300 --> 01:31:55.420]   You can't mention the U.S. on TikTok.
[01:31:55.420 --> 01:31:57.700]   You can't talk about Hong Kong on TikTok.
[01:31:57.700 --> 01:32:00.060]   So I'm not saying TikTok's perfect.
[01:32:00.060 --> 01:32:02.940]   But I also don't think it's a massive security threat to the United States.
[01:32:02.940 --> 01:32:07.960]   On Friday, the president said, "We're going to ban TikTok as soon as Saturday didn't
[01:32:07.960 --> 01:32:08.960]   do it."
[01:32:08.960 --> 01:32:14.240]   And, much to the chagrin of Microsoft, nobody gets to buy it.
[01:32:14.240 --> 01:32:19.080]   Apparently, Microsoft, we found out then, had been negotiating with TikTok to buy the
[01:32:19.080 --> 01:32:24.200]   U.S. Australian and New Zealand assets to create a TikTok U.S.
[01:32:24.200 --> 01:32:27.640]   Not sure why Microsoft wanted to take that on.
[01:32:27.640 --> 01:32:29.880]   But maybe they thought it was a good deal.
[01:32:29.880 --> 01:32:31.240]   Some say it's the next YouTube.
[01:32:31.240 --> 01:32:33.760]   So maybe Microsoft said, "Hey, we missed out on YouTube.
[01:32:33.760 --> 01:32:34.760]   Here's our chance.
[01:32:34.760 --> 01:32:36.160]   Minecraft does pretty well for us.
[01:32:36.160 --> 01:32:39.760]   A great way to get the youngs in the Microsoft fold early on."
[01:32:39.760 --> 01:32:41.840]   That's what I was talking about.
[01:32:41.840 --> 01:32:44.400]   I was like, "TikTok is like Minecraft for them."
[01:32:44.400 --> 01:32:45.400]   Yeah.
[01:32:45.400 --> 01:32:47.600]   Then-- Or trying to work so well for them.
[01:32:47.600 --> 01:32:50.440]   They always-- when they copy something, it works really well for them.
[01:32:50.440 --> 01:32:51.760]   But the Minecraft has done-- you know what?
[01:32:51.760 --> 01:32:52.760]   They haven't touched Minecraft.
[01:32:52.760 --> 01:32:57.040]   They've done-- I presume they've done the same thing with TikTok, which is hands-off.
[01:32:57.040 --> 01:32:59.920]   Just give money and keep it going because we like that.
[01:32:59.920 --> 01:33:01.600]   Leave it alone and collect the--
[01:33:01.600 --> 01:33:05.280]   So when the president said we're not going to be by it, Satya Nadell said, "Whoa, okay,
[01:33:05.280 --> 01:33:08.920]   well, we're going to hold off on those negotiations we've been working on."
[01:33:08.920 --> 01:33:13.800]   Then the next day, Nadella and Trump have a conversation.
[01:33:13.800 --> 01:33:15.520]   It's back on, boys.
[01:33:15.520 --> 01:33:18.360]   But the Donald says, "I want to cut."
[01:33:18.360 --> 01:33:20.720]   I was going to say, "There's a cat.
[01:33:20.720 --> 01:33:22.720]   It's just unbelievable."
[01:33:22.720 --> 01:33:27.680]   Just-- like, just idiotic.
[01:33:27.680 --> 01:33:32.760]   I mean, my husband, who is not-- who is an actual Republican, not a Trump Republican,
[01:33:32.760 --> 01:33:37.000]   but is basically very conservative, very business-minded.
[01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:41.520]   Many things that Donald Trump does drive him absolutely bonkers.
[01:33:41.520 --> 01:33:45.880]   But he also kind of is like, "He's not as upset as I am about it."
[01:33:45.880 --> 01:33:51.920]   In the sense, he doesn't take it to heart and feel like our country is being betrayed.
[01:33:51.920 --> 01:33:57.960]   However, this, he was like, "Explitive, expletive."
[01:33:57.960 --> 01:34:01.920]   It's like Tony Soprano saying, "I want to cut."
[01:34:01.920 --> 01:34:04.760]   Now, it goes to the Treasury Department.
[01:34:04.760 --> 01:34:08.160]   It's not like going into Donald's pocket, but never the most.
[01:34:08.160 --> 01:34:10.640]   This guy thinks he's the dealmaker in chief.
[01:34:10.640 --> 01:34:12.400]   He doesn't want to do his real job.
[01:34:12.400 --> 01:34:16.400]   He just wants to have this weird fake that's not even his role.
[01:34:16.400 --> 01:34:19.680]   It's like he didn't understand what president actually does.
[01:34:19.680 --> 01:34:22.720]   By saying that now, I think-- it's my opinion.
[01:34:22.720 --> 01:34:27.040]   We talked about this on Windows Weekly-- that this is tarnished to deal greatly for Microsoft
[01:34:27.040 --> 01:34:29.640]   as much as they'd like to have TikTok.
[01:34:29.640 --> 01:34:35.640]   Now it looks like it was some strong arm operation on the part of the United States to get China,
[01:34:35.640 --> 01:34:40.200]   a Chinese company to give Microsoft a company and give a chunk of change to the Treasury
[01:34:40.200 --> 01:34:41.200]   Department.
[01:34:41.200 --> 01:34:43.400]   It looks like highway robbery.
[01:34:43.400 --> 01:34:46.840]   It looks like-- it looks like Mafioso behavior.
[01:34:46.840 --> 01:34:52.200]   And if I were Microsoft at this point, I would say, "Yeah, no, we don't."
[01:34:52.200 --> 01:34:56.440]   Because that's going to-- A, it's going to make a big enemy of the Chinese government,
[01:34:56.440 --> 01:34:58.680]   probably not what Microsoft would like to do.
[01:34:58.680 --> 01:35:02.120]   And media there are now saying, "This is all a trick to steal.
[01:35:02.120 --> 01:35:03.120]   We'll TikTok from that."
[01:35:03.120 --> 01:35:04.120]   It is!
[01:35:04.120 --> 01:35:06.120]   And so the Chinese government is against it.
[01:35:06.120 --> 01:35:09.120]   Yes, they're right.
[01:35:09.120 --> 01:35:11.240]   They're right.
[01:35:11.240 --> 01:35:12.240]   It's appalling.
[01:35:12.240 --> 01:35:15.840]   He just is-- he ruins everything he touches.
[01:35:15.840 --> 01:35:20.000]   I don't know if it's a peachable.
[01:35:20.000 --> 01:35:22.320]   It just seems bad.
[01:35:22.320 --> 01:35:23.240]   Bad, bad, bad.
[01:35:23.240 --> 01:35:30.240]   And I do feel bad for Microsoft, which I think thought that they were going to be a hero
[01:35:30.240 --> 01:35:34.920]   in all this, helping keep TikTok alive, making an American company.
[01:35:34.920 --> 01:35:38.480]   Now they look like they're just a part of the kleptocracy.
[01:35:38.480 --> 01:35:42.280]   So my prediction is that we will hear an announcement soon for Microsoft in the next
[01:35:42.280 --> 01:35:45.640]   few days where they say, "Never mind.
[01:35:45.640 --> 01:35:50.400]   This has turned sour."
[01:35:50.400 --> 01:35:54.040]   And I only-- What they're going to get was English language markets, right?
[01:35:54.040 --> 01:35:56.000]   They're going to get the core business.
[01:35:56.000 --> 01:36:03.640]   I also think, which is probably fine in their perspective too, just you guys do your thing.
[01:36:03.640 --> 01:36:07.800]   I honestly also think the president is not going to ban TikTok.
[01:36:07.800 --> 01:36:12.800]   This is just more saber rattling from the saber rattler and change.
[01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:13.800]   Transstanding.
[01:36:13.800 --> 01:36:14.800]   Yeah.
[01:36:14.800 --> 01:36:18.240]   Now that Jeff Jarvis is on TikTok.
[01:36:18.240 --> 01:36:23.640]   I've never been to TikTok as I'm too damned old, but I'm too pissed right now to be silent.
[01:36:23.640 --> 01:36:28.440]   Whether or not TikTok exists here or in China or anywhere is none of Donald Trump's damn
[01:36:28.440 --> 01:36:29.440]   business.
[01:36:29.440 --> 01:36:33.480]   Whether or not Microsoft buys it and Pupy makes TikToks is none of Trump's business.
[01:36:33.480 --> 01:36:35.880]   He's trying to cut off a tool of public speech.
[01:36:35.880 --> 01:36:37.320]   He's violating the First Amendment.
[01:36:37.320 --> 01:36:40.320]   So Donald Trump, get off our TikTok yard.
[01:36:40.320 --> 01:36:41.320]   All right now.
[01:36:41.320 --> 01:36:42.320]   All right.
[01:36:42.320 --> 01:36:43.320]   Oh my goodness.
[01:36:43.320 --> 01:36:46.320]   Well done, JJ.
[01:36:46.320 --> 01:36:47.320]   Well, damn.
[01:36:47.320 --> 01:36:48.320]   Well, damn.
[01:36:48.320 --> 01:36:54.720]   He's wearing a T-shirt that says, dude, got to go.
[01:36:54.720 --> 01:36:55.880]   I like it.
[01:36:55.880 --> 01:36:56.880]   That's really good.
[01:36:56.880 --> 01:36:58.880]   How about a Harris T-shirt?
[01:36:58.880 --> 01:36:59.880]   That's good.
[01:36:59.880 --> 01:37:00.880]   All right.
[01:37:00.880 --> 01:37:01.880]   Mr. Jarvis, for you.
[01:37:01.880 --> 01:37:04.960]   It is kind of, yeah, there you go, fist bump.
[01:37:04.960 --> 01:37:07.840]   It is staggering, really, what has happened here.
[01:37:07.840 --> 01:37:10.840]   And I think nobody's coming out of this looking good.
[01:37:10.840 --> 01:37:17.440]   And I agree that TikTok, there's some issues for sure with TikTok.
[01:37:17.440 --> 01:37:23.280]   But I also think it's an amazing medium.
[01:37:23.280 --> 01:37:27.200]   And the people that a lot of creative stuff's going on on TikTok that's really fantastic.
[01:37:27.200 --> 01:37:30.440]   One of what it means is be most true is how it's collaborative.
[01:37:30.440 --> 01:37:31.440]   Yeah.
[01:37:31.440 --> 01:37:33.640]   The way you, you know, so now somebody-
[01:37:33.640 --> 01:37:34.840]   You play off of each other.
[01:37:34.840 --> 01:37:39.160]   You could take what Jeff said and do a lip sync with it or they could make music with
[01:37:39.160 --> 01:37:40.400]   it or they could set it.
[01:37:40.400 --> 01:37:42.840]   There's some, I just think it's really great.
[01:37:42.840 --> 01:37:47.200]   I've seen some creative stuff on there and I appreciate the creativity.
[01:37:47.200 --> 01:37:49.320]   I just don't think it's an app for me.
[01:37:49.320 --> 01:37:51.040]   I'm a funny daddy, I guess.
[01:37:51.040 --> 01:37:52.640]   You're an old fart, like me?
[01:37:52.640 --> 01:37:53.640]   Yeah, I am.
[01:37:53.640 --> 01:37:54.640]   But Stacy's-
[01:37:54.640 --> 01:37:55.640]   I don't have to make TikTok.
[01:37:55.640 --> 01:37:56.640]   I'm old-ish.
[01:37:56.640 --> 01:37:57.640]   Sorry, old-ish.
[01:37:57.640 --> 01:37:59.080]   And Taniah are the same age.
[01:37:59.080 --> 01:38:01.680]   Actually, you might be younger than I am.
[01:38:01.680 --> 01:38:02.680]   I think I am.
[01:38:02.680 --> 01:38:03.680]   Yeah.
[01:38:03.680 --> 01:38:04.680]   I was allowed to say I think it's actually-
[01:38:04.680 --> 01:38:05.680]   I'm old-ish.
[01:38:05.680 --> 01:38:09.560]   He is in the prime of his life.
[01:38:09.560 --> 01:38:11.160]   That is all we will say.
[01:38:11.160 --> 01:38:12.160]   Yes.
[01:38:12.160 --> 01:38:13.320]   There you go.
[01:38:13.320 --> 01:38:15.720]   So, have any of you made TikToks?
[01:38:15.720 --> 01:38:17.360]   Oh yeah, we have it.
[01:38:17.360 --> 01:38:18.360]   I have a TikTok example.
[01:38:18.360 --> 01:38:19.720]   We also have a Twit TikTok.
[01:38:19.720 --> 01:38:20.720]   What is it called?
[01:38:20.720 --> 01:38:21.720]   I watched Twit TikTok.
[01:38:21.720 --> 01:38:22.720]   Twit TikTok.
[01:38:22.720 --> 01:38:23.720]   Yeah, TwitTok is-
[01:38:23.720 --> 01:38:24.720]   That's interesting.
[01:38:24.720 --> 01:38:27.560]   I've seen a couple clips of me on the Twit-Tok.
[01:38:27.560 --> 01:38:34.160]   And I'm actually very- I took it off because, I mean, really, my only complaint is it's too
[01:38:34.160 --> 01:38:35.160]   damn addictive.
[01:38:35.160 --> 01:38:37.680]   It's such a rabbit hole.
[01:38:37.680 --> 01:38:39.800]   You start watching and it's hard to stop.
[01:38:39.800 --> 01:38:41.240]   For me, it was noisy.
[01:38:41.240 --> 01:38:44.520]   I kept getting a bunch of notifications for things I did not care about.
[01:38:44.520 --> 01:38:50.240]   I think it was trying to figure me out from a platform perspective like, "What exactly
[01:38:50.240 --> 01:38:52.400]   does this guy like?"
[01:38:52.400 --> 01:38:54.440]   So it just kept sending me notifications.
[01:38:54.440 --> 01:38:57.400]   And I'm like, "I don't care about that."
[01:38:57.400 --> 01:38:59.640]   And I think I followed maybe three people.
[01:38:59.640 --> 01:39:02.400]   I've found all the notifications off.
[01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:05.840]   Your kids used TikTok?
[01:39:05.840 --> 01:39:09.000]   They started it, but they don't anymore.
[01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:12.160]   They're still stuck on the Snapchat side of things.
[01:39:12.160 --> 01:39:13.600]   Well, that's the thing.
[01:39:13.600 --> 01:39:20.560]   I don't think TikTok's anymore harmful than Snapchat or Instagram.
[01:39:20.560 --> 01:39:23.560]   I think that this is- I don't know.
[01:39:23.560 --> 01:39:26.360]   I have problems even with the Huawei thing.
[01:39:26.360 --> 01:39:31.880]   You could perhaps make the case that you shouldn't let them power national infrastructure
[01:39:31.880 --> 01:39:33.040]   like the 5G network.
[01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:34.040]   Okay, fine.
[01:39:34.040 --> 01:39:37.400]   We allowed to sell phones in the United States for crying out loud.
[01:39:37.400 --> 01:39:39.240]   So it's a shame.
[01:39:39.240 --> 01:39:41.520]   I just think it's a shame.
[01:39:41.520 --> 01:39:43.600]   It does not reflect well on Microsoft.
[01:39:43.600 --> 01:39:50.320]   That's why I think if they can think of a way out, there is a face-saving move that
[01:39:50.320 --> 01:39:53.800]   they could make probably that way.
[01:39:53.800 --> 01:39:55.800]   Which is?
[01:39:55.800 --> 01:40:01.760]   If Microsoft, which is, of course, a big cloud company, said, "Look, we'll take a
[01:40:01.760 --> 01:40:08.560]   small stake in TikTok and return, we will host all the TikTok data for American users
[01:40:08.560 --> 01:40:12.000]   in our Microsoft servers.
[01:40:12.000 --> 01:40:14.800]   And we won't give access to the Chinese.
[01:40:14.800 --> 01:40:16.000]   They can't ask for it.
[01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:19.000]   That's ours."
[01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.920]   And then the president could come out saying, "Oh, see?
[01:40:21.920 --> 01:40:22.920]   Yeah, I made a deal.
[01:40:22.920 --> 01:40:25.400]   Well, all of this is good."
[01:40:25.400 --> 01:40:28.840]   Microsoft would get out of this kind of untenable position there and looking like they're
[01:40:28.840 --> 01:40:31.160]   extorting a Chinese company.
[01:40:31.160 --> 01:40:35.240]   And the Chinese would get to continue to own it.
[01:40:35.240 --> 01:40:37.520]   I think that would be a sensible plan.
[01:40:37.520 --> 01:40:43.920]   I just can't imagine, first of all, I don't know what legal basis he'd have for banning
[01:40:43.920 --> 01:40:44.920]   it.
[01:40:44.920 --> 01:40:45.920]   He doesn't.
[01:40:45.920 --> 01:40:48.080]   He just assumes he does.
[01:40:48.080 --> 01:40:50.760]   But he doesn't need a legal basis for anything.
[01:40:50.760 --> 01:40:53.400]   I mean, this man tweets random stuff about delaying the election.
[01:40:53.400 --> 01:40:55.120]   This is not a man who's concerned about legal basis.
[01:40:55.120 --> 01:40:56.120]   No, he doesn't.
[01:40:56.120 --> 01:40:57.120]   No worry about that.
[01:40:57.120 --> 01:40:58.120]   I think he's an emperor.
[01:40:58.120 --> 01:40:59.120]   Yeah.
[01:40:59.120 --> 01:41:02.800]   What he would do is he would issue an executive order.
[01:41:02.800 --> 01:41:05.360]   It would have some effect.
[01:41:05.360 --> 01:41:09.080]   Chiefly, the courthouse would get very busy.
[01:41:09.080 --> 01:41:12.320]   And then we just sit there in limbo for ages and ages.
[01:41:12.320 --> 01:41:13.320]   It would not be good.
[01:41:13.320 --> 01:41:15.040]   It would not be good.
[01:41:15.040 --> 01:41:19.760]   Well, we'd sit in limbo, but we'd also, I mean, it's not like there'd be a...
[01:41:19.760 --> 01:41:20.960]   Nothing would happen.
[01:41:20.960 --> 01:41:21.960]   Right?
[01:41:21.960 --> 01:41:24.960]   Oh, what is the word when they stop?
[01:41:24.960 --> 01:41:25.960]   Why can't I think of this?
[01:41:25.960 --> 01:41:26.960]   In injunction?
[01:41:26.960 --> 01:41:27.960]   Thank you.
[01:41:27.960 --> 01:41:28.960]   Yeah.
[01:41:28.960 --> 01:41:30.960]   There's not going to be a injunction.
[01:41:30.960 --> 01:41:38.760]   So the other thing that I think is beneficial to all this is TikTok now is bending over backwards
[01:41:38.760 --> 01:41:39.880]   to be a good citizen.
[01:41:39.880 --> 01:41:43.160]   In fact, one of the things they said, which I thought was really good, is they will publish
[01:41:43.160 --> 01:41:44.160]   our algorithm.
[01:41:44.160 --> 01:41:45.160]   Wow.
[01:41:45.160 --> 01:41:47.440]   And we call them...
[01:41:47.440 --> 01:41:50.640]   And I honestly think algorithm is one of the biggest problems we face right now with
[01:41:50.640 --> 01:41:53.960]   Facebook, YouTube, all of these.
[01:41:53.960 --> 01:41:56.080]   We call on Facebook and YouTube to do the same.
[01:41:56.080 --> 01:41:57.240]   Publish the algorithm.
[01:41:57.240 --> 01:42:01.240]   Let us see what the recommendation engine does to highlight this.
[01:42:01.240 --> 01:42:02.920]   What does it mean to publish it?
[01:42:02.920 --> 01:42:04.720]   Somebody's going to understand what the algorithm says.
[01:42:04.720 --> 01:42:05.720]   Well, interestingly...
[01:42:05.720 --> 01:42:06.720]   It depends on the data.
[01:42:06.720 --> 01:42:07.720]   It depends on lots of things.
[01:42:07.720 --> 01:42:08.720]   Matt Cuts was on Twitter on Sunday.
[01:42:08.720 --> 01:42:11.120]   He is still administrator of the United States Digital Service.
[01:42:11.120 --> 01:42:12.120]   Awesome guy.
[01:42:12.120 --> 01:42:15.040]   Early Googler knows a lot about algorithm.
[01:42:15.040 --> 01:42:18.000]   He knows how the Google search algorithm works.
[01:42:18.000 --> 01:42:20.080]   He said, "You know, it's a trivial algorithm."
[01:42:20.080 --> 01:42:24.160]   He said, "Compared to the Google algorithm, what TikTok's doing is very, very simple.
[01:42:24.160 --> 01:42:26.200]   You look at which videos get the most engagement.
[01:42:26.200 --> 01:42:27.600]   And then you push those."
[01:42:27.600 --> 01:42:28.600]   Oh, shut them up.
[01:42:28.600 --> 01:42:29.600]   It's pretty straightforward.
[01:42:29.600 --> 01:42:30.920]   So they're not giving away.
[01:42:30.920 --> 01:42:34.240]   There's no topicality or anything the way that is on Facebook and Google.
[01:42:34.240 --> 01:42:35.240]   I don't think so.
[01:42:35.240 --> 01:42:40.120]   And I think that's actually one of the charming things about TikTok.
[01:42:40.120 --> 01:42:41.720]   This is all they had to do.
[01:42:41.720 --> 01:42:46.760]   Make an app that was fun to use, that had the tools, the people who would make videos
[01:42:46.760 --> 01:42:48.080]   wanted.
[01:42:48.080 --> 01:42:53.240]   So make it accessible, desirable, because they need to create, get people to create millions
[01:42:53.240 --> 01:42:54.240]   of videos.
[01:42:54.240 --> 01:42:58.680]   And then have an algorithm that surfaces the ones that people like.
[01:42:58.680 --> 01:42:59.680]   Step three, profit.
[01:42:59.680 --> 01:43:00.680]   That's right.
[01:43:00.680 --> 01:43:06.600]   I just wish those algorithms were tailored more towards me.
[01:43:06.600 --> 01:43:10.200]   But then again, it's probably not tailored towards me because I'm not feeding it.
[01:43:10.200 --> 01:43:11.200]   That's right.
[01:43:11.200 --> 01:43:12.200]   Yeah.
[01:43:12.200 --> 01:43:14.560]   If you started participating more, I think it's interesting.
[01:43:14.560 --> 01:43:18.320]   The range of stuff, there's a lot of stuff like Jeff just did that's political.
[01:43:18.320 --> 01:43:19.320]   Yeah.
[01:43:19.320 --> 01:43:20.840]   There's a lot of very funny stuff.
[01:43:20.840 --> 01:43:22.080]   Sarah Cooper, we've showed her.
[01:43:22.080 --> 01:43:24.080]   Sarah Cooper is just the genius of it.
[01:43:24.080 --> 01:43:25.080]   Yeah.
[01:43:25.080 --> 01:43:26.080]   There's a...
[01:43:26.080 --> 01:43:28.120]   She should get about half that 200 million.
[01:43:28.120 --> 01:43:29.800]   They're putting it in the US.
[01:43:29.800 --> 01:43:33.920]   Have you seen the guy who does the...
[01:43:33.920 --> 01:43:36.200]   My name is Dr. Fauci.
[01:43:36.200 --> 01:43:37.200]   Yeah.
[01:43:37.200 --> 01:43:39.520]   Did we do that one?
[01:43:39.520 --> 01:43:40.520]   Have we played that on?
[01:43:40.520 --> 01:43:42.520]   Yeah, we played that on here.
[01:43:42.520 --> 01:43:44.160]   So that guy is great.
[01:43:44.160 --> 01:43:46.600]   He does a lot of...
[01:43:46.600 --> 01:43:50.000]   He's kind of like the Randy Rainbow of TikTok.
[01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:52.320]   He does a lot of great parody songs and songs.
[01:43:52.320 --> 01:43:53.920]   I just think there's funny stuff.
[01:43:53.920 --> 01:43:59.280]   And I think it's a perfect time for a quarantine where people are making the stuff in their
[01:43:59.280 --> 01:44:00.280]   home.
[01:44:00.280 --> 01:44:01.280]   Yeah.
[01:44:01.280 --> 01:44:08.800]   And like I said, it's a joy to see what people are coming up with right now and to try to
[01:44:08.800 --> 01:44:11.600]   get away from what's really happening outside.
[01:44:11.600 --> 01:44:12.600]   I agree.
[01:44:12.600 --> 01:44:14.120]   It's really refreshing.
[01:44:14.120 --> 01:44:15.280]   Some of it is pretty funny.
[01:44:15.280 --> 01:44:16.280]   Some of it is...
[01:44:16.280 --> 01:44:17.880]   I'm tired of seeing it.
[01:44:17.880 --> 01:44:21.440]   I'm tired of seeing the lip syncing of a song that they like.
[01:44:21.440 --> 01:44:23.440]   What's the most interesting to me?
[01:44:23.440 --> 01:44:26.960]   I know it is to you guys too is how you think of...
[01:44:26.960 --> 01:44:28.480]   Like Twitter is a perfect example.
[01:44:28.480 --> 01:44:30.520]   It's going to be text messaging.
[01:44:30.520 --> 01:44:33.720]   You think of it, you create it, you put it out there and then you let people do it and
[01:44:33.720 --> 01:44:34.720]   it changes.
[01:44:34.720 --> 01:44:35.720]   Yeah.
[01:44:35.720 --> 01:44:38.600]   And now it's something completely different that was created by its users.
[01:44:38.600 --> 01:44:41.760]   I think that's one of the best things that happens in tech.
[01:44:41.760 --> 01:44:47.840]   For instance, big story in Axios this week, Instagram, I had no idea, there are a lot
[01:44:47.840 --> 01:44:54.720]   of companies posting long text pieces on Instagram.
[01:44:54.720 --> 01:44:57.040]   That's not new.
[01:44:57.040 --> 01:44:59.560]   ProPublica does it?
[01:44:59.560 --> 01:45:05.200]   No it's not news, but new, but it's growing.
[01:45:05.200 --> 01:45:09.360]   Their headline is Instagram morphs into an information powerhouse.
[01:45:09.360 --> 01:45:13.880]   I think that's interesting because it means Instagram is now a source of news for a lot
[01:45:13.880 --> 01:45:14.880]   of people.
[01:45:14.880 --> 01:45:15.880]   Mm-hmm.
[01:45:15.880 --> 01:45:16.880]   Right?
[01:45:16.880 --> 01:45:23.680]   I've always sort of tinkled around on my Instagram account and to underscore Pruitt,
[01:45:23.680 --> 01:45:25.480]   just in case you're interested.
[01:45:25.480 --> 01:45:28.280]   Just to see what engages people.
[01:45:28.280 --> 01:45:31.480]   And a couple of things always come to mind.
[01:45:31.480 --> 01:45:34.840]   People love selfies as much as I hate selfies.
[01:45:34.840 --> 01:45:35.840]   People love selfies.
[01:45:35.840 --> 01:45:38.880]   There's always engagement there.
[01:45:38.880 --> 01:45:44.720]   And I would write captions based on the images or just something that was on my mind.
[01:45:44.720 --> 01:45:47.320]   And I start to wonder are people even reading this stuff?
[01:45:47.320 --> 01:45:52.160]   So every now and then in those captions, I would say something totally off the cuff
[01:45:52.160 --> 01:45:54.880]   just to see if people were reading it in Holy Crap.
[01:45:54.880 --> 01:45:59.480]   People read those things regardless of how long those captions are.
[01:45:59.480 --> 01:46:00.480]   Mm-hmm.
[01:46:00.480 --> 01:46:02.480]   Like can I tell a cool fart story?
[01:46:02.480 --> 01:46:03.400]   Yeah, a quick old fart story.
[01:46:03.400 --> 01:46:06.160]   So when I was a Claremont, what was then?
[01:46:06.160 --> 01:46:08.920]   Claremont Men's College, my first year in college.
[01:46:08.920 --> 01:46:13.080]   And there was Professor Roode who was an odd political science professor.
[01:46:13.080 --> 01:46:14.640]   He loved lawn papers.
[01:46:14.640 --> 01:46:16.480]   So the longer the paper, the higher the grade.
[01:46:16.480 --> 01:46:18.560]   But he never graded them until the end of the term.
[01:46:18.560 --> 01:46:20.120]   And people never handed them into the end of the term.
[01:46:20.120 --> 01:46:24.640]   So he would be the last day of the term with a huge stack of papers.
[01:46:24.640 --> 01:46:27.640]   And they would always come back with a grade and no comment.
[01:46:27.640 --> 01:46:30.400]   And the rumor was he just weighed them.
[01:46:30.400 --> 01:46:35.800]   But one time in a 60 page paper in the middle of nowhere, somebody just put parenthesis,
[01:46:35.800 --> 01:46:37.360]   Roode sucks and parenthesis.
[01:46:37.360 --> 01:46:40.280]   The only comment on the paper was source.
[01:46:40.280 --> 01:46:43.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:46:43.920 --> 01:46:45.720]   People read in Zabrazu.
[01:46:45.720 --> 01:46:46.720]   That's funny.
[01:46:46.720 --> 01:46:50.760]   Here's an account called "Slactivists."
[01:46:50.760 --> 01:46:54.160]   Thus, "Slactivists" on Instagram is no pictures at all.
[01:46:54.160 --> 01:46:54.920]   It's news stories.
[01:46:54.920 --> 01:46:57.000]   It's text news stories.
[01:46:57.000 --> 01:46:57.760]   Yeah.
[01:46:57.760 --> 01:46:58.720]   Lots of hash messages.
[01:46:58.720 --> 01:47:00.640]   I mean, think about it.
[01:47:00.640 --> 01:47:03.600]   When you're on your phone, you go into an app.
[01:47:03.600 --> 01:47:05.360]   You want to spend the time in that app.
[01:47:05.360 --> 01:47:09.640]   You don't want to be-- like if you're waiting somewhere, you're just going to be like, OK,
[01:47:09.640 --> 01:47:12.040]   I'm going to open this and I'm going to look at this, this, and this.
[01:47:12.040 --> 01:47:13.520]   But you're all in the same place.
[01:47:13.520 --> 01:47:15.600]   So you want to get everything you can in that place.
[01:47:15.600 --> 01:47:18.520]   It makes sense to optimize for that.
[01:47:18.520 --> 01:47:26.400]   Educators for justice, diversify your narrative, generous, pro publicas doing it.
[01:47:26.400 --> 01:47:27.560]   It's really interesting.
[01:47:27.560 --> 01:47:38.560]   So the bottom line is I like seeing what creators do with a platform once they get
[01:47:38.560 --> 01:47:39.520]   full access to it.
[01:47:39.520 --> 01:47:40.960]   And I think that's what's happening on TikTok.
[01:47:40.960 --> 01:47:45.960]   It's very beginning of a process, very beginning of a process of figuring out what they can
[01:47:45.960 --> 01:47:47.760]   do with the internet.
[01:47:47.760 --> 01:47:49.040]   Yeah, that's exactly right.
[01:47:49.040 --> 01:47:49.880]   Guess what?
[01:47:49.880 --> 01:47:50.880]   Guess what I'm going to do?
[01:47:50.880 --> 01:47:52.280]   I'm going to raise Gutenberg.
[01:47:52.280 --> 01:47:53.680]   More Atlantic, Gutenberg.
[01:47:53.680 --> 01:47:54.880]   No, no, no, Gutenberg.
[01:47:54.880 --> 01:48:10.660]   The analogy that I've said before. I took 150 years before he invented the regular published newspaper, but I realized it took the same amount of time to invent essays and the modern novel.
[01:48:10.660 --> 01:48:18.660]   I think you talked about this. Yeah. The novels were terrible. Women were, that was a problem. I'm sorry. My texting is going crazy.
[01:48:18.660 --> 01:48:26.320]   Somebody's telling you something that you must. Secrets. Secrets, y'all.
[01:48:26.320 --> 01:48:33.160]   Hey, let me to wait. Hey, let's play that drum thing so we can do a change log here before we wrap it up.
[01:48:33.160 --> 01:48:35.860]   The Google change log.
[01:48:35.860 --> 01:48:48.160]   This one comes from Carsten's son, Zach, who's very concerned because he says it's going to be a problem for foreign language creators.
[01:48:48.160 --> 01:48:56.500]   YouTube is ending its community captions feature. Deaf creators aren't happy about it either. That is bad.
[01:48:56.500 --> 01:49:05.400]   The captions. Is it going to turn to its automatic one? Yeah, I guess so. The automatic captions are less than a desirable tool.
[01:49:05.400 --> 01:49:12.660]   Google's gotten better at that, but it's not as people would assume it's gotten better. It's gotten better. It used to be awful.
[01:49:12.660 --> 01:49:18.260]   Was community captioning a place for people to sneak in bad things? Maybe it was a spam thing.
[01:49:18.260 --> 01:49:26.860]   Google's YouTube says it, which just wasn't widely used. Zach says he has made friends around the globe through his live streaming channel.
[01:49:26.860 --> 01:49:33.360]   He won't be able to watch his friends YouTube channel. It's in Finnish. And it was the community captioning that made it accessible.
[01:49:33.360 --> 01:49:39.360]   Does he speak Finnish? No, that's the point. Oh, he wants that captioning.
[01:49:39.360 --> 01:49:45.660]   But they're going to replace it with their automated captions.
[01:49:45.660 --> 01:49:56.860]   They say it was rarely used and had problems with spam and abuse. It will focus on other creator tools. They're literally just taking the captions off.
[01:49:56.860 --> 01:50:02.760]   You could still use your own captions, automatic captions, and third party tools and services.
[01:50:02.760 --> 01:50:05.760]   There you go.
[01:50:05.760 --> 01:50:11.660]   So you still have options. Yeah, but the community captioning, that was nice. But it's hard. You got to police it, right?
[01:50:11.660 --> 01:50:14.360]   And that's probably expensive and Google didn't want to do it.
[01:50:14.360 --> 01:50:21.560]   They've turned on nearby share. Yay. This is a copy of Apple's Airdrop capability. Samsung talked about it today.
[01:50:21.560 --> 01:50:33.160]   On their event, they mentioned UWB Ultra Wideband, which is the chip that Apple puts in its iPhone so that you can point at somebody and share content.
[01:50:33.160 --> 01:50:38.060]   If you have a Pixel phone, you'll get it, I think now.
[01:50:38.060 --> 01:50:45.360]   Android 6 Plus is required. Samsung says they're going to have it. It's kind of interesting.
[01:50:45.360 --> 01:50:55.660]   Because it uses Bluetooth and then it will choose the faster Wi-Fi or WebRTC if it's available.
[01:50:55.660 --> 01:51:03.860]   So do the handshake and then choose a faster way to stream for high quality data.
[01:51:03.860 --> 01:51:12.760]   You'll find it in your settings. Turn on device visibility.
[01:51:12.760 --> 01:51:16.660]   And soon it'll work with Chromebooks. So you'll be able to share.
[01:51:16.660 --> 01:51:20.860]   I use Airdrop all the time. It's one reason to be in the Apple ecosystem.
[01:51:20.860 --> 01:51:27.160]   It's very easy to send a picture from your phone to your computer or to another person to an iPad.
[01:51:27.160 --> 01:51:34.660]   It's a really nice feature. I'm glad that they're adding this select Google Pixel and Samsung devices will be the first to receive.
[01:51:34.660 --> 01:51:36.060]   It's pretty good.
[01:51:36.060 --> 01:51:42.060]   I'm going to help you with things like when you take a picture of everybody and actually it won't.
[01:51:42.060 --> 01:51:43.860]   Because it's not a phone. Never mind.
[01:51:43.860 --> 01:51:47.460]   Well, you can one by one share it. I've done that.
[01:51:47.460 --> 01:51:51.660]   Actually, it was used. Did you know this? It was used on the Crew Dragon.
[01:51:51.660 --> 01:51:57.860]   Well, yeah. When Doug and Bob were coming home, they got home on Sunday, right? Safe and sound.
[01:51:57.860 --> 01:52:01.960]   Nice. Really exciting to see the space program ramping up.
[01:52:01.960 --> 01:52:06.060]   But I think it was Doug's. No, it was Bob's.
[01:52:06.060 --> 01:52:11.460]   They use iPads for their manuals and some information and stuff.
[01:52:11.460 --> 01:52:14.960]   Doug's was like not getting any signal. They didn't have any information.
[01:52:14.960 --> 01:52:17.560]   So they quickly had or Bob's wasn't.
[01:52:17.560 --> 01:52:23.760]   So they quickly had Doug take screenshots on his iPad and airdrop it over to Bob's iPad
[01:52:23.760 --> 01:52:27.460]   so that he'd have all the information he needed for reentry.
[01:52:27.460 --> 01:52:29.460]   Airdrop.
[01:52:29.460 --> 01:52:30.960]   That's good stuff.
[01:52:30.960 --> 01:52:32.760]   Yep. That wasn't really a Google thing.
[01:52:32.760 --> 01:52:36.260]   When you're trying to come back to Earth, airdrop may not be the best.
[01:52:36.260 --> 01:52:38.260]   [laughter]
[01:52:38.260 --> 01:52:40.760]   They seem to use it. Yeah, it's cool.
[01:52:40.760 --> 01:52:43.060]   Different terminology, please. Thank you.
[01:52:43.060 --> 01:52:46.560]   Google Music Shut Down Has Begun.
[01:52:46.560 --> 01:52:49.360]   Your musical was deleted in December.
[01:52:49.360 --> 01:52:54.460]   If you're a Google Play Music user, when you go there, look for the announcement,
[01:52:54.460 --> 01:52:57.460]   the import button. I finally got it.
[01:52:57.460 --> 01:52:59.560]   You'll want to do that soon.
[01:52:59.560 --> 01:53:04.060]   By late August, you'll no longer be able to upload or download music through Music Manager.
[01:53:04.060 --> 01:53:08.060]   By September, the streaming will shut down in New Zealand and South Africa.
[01:53:08.060 --> 01:53:10.960]   In October, global streaming will shut down.
[01:53:10.960 --> 01:53:13.960]   The Google Music app and website will cease to be.
[01:53:13.960 --> 01:53:18.960]   In December, all that music you uploaded to Google Music will be gone.
[01:53:18.960 --> 01:53:20.960]   So make sure you transfer it.
[01:53:20.960 --> 01:53:26.960]   If you don't see the announcement, you can go to music.uqtube.com/transfer.
[01:53:26.960 --> 01:53:29.960]   You can see I've done it. My transfer is complete.
[01:53:29.960 --> 01:53:30.960]   Yep, I did it.
[01:53:30.960 --> 01:53:33.960]   Which means all of my uploads are there now, which is nice.
[01:53:33.960 --> 01:53:39.460]   I'm not sure I love the change from Google Play Music to YouTube Music, but that's the way it is.
[01:53:39.460 --> 01:53:40.460]   Nope.
[01:53:40.460 --> 01:53:41.460]   Didn't go with it.
[01:53:41.460 --> 01:53:42.460]   I don't want to go with it.
[01:53:42.460 --> 01:53:43.460]   We went to Spotify here at this house.
[01:53:43.460 --> 01:53:44.460]   Oh, really?
[01:53:44.460 --> 01:53:45.460]   I think Spotify is the winner.
[01:53:45.460 --> 01:53:46.460]   Yeah.
[01:53:46.460 --> 01:53:47.460]   Yeah, I really do.
[01:53:47.460 --> 01:53:52.660]   I do appreciate Google being pretty proactive with the communication because I've seen a
[01:53:52.660 --> 01:53:58.460]   gazillion messages or notifications or emails about that service being shut down.
[01:53:58.460 --> 01:53:59.460]   Yeah, they're good.
[01:53:59.460 --> 01:54:00.460]   I've only seen one.
[01:54:00.460 --> 01:54:01.460]   I have.
[01:54:01.460 --> 01:54:02.460]   I was like, "Huh."
[01:54:02.460 --> 01:54:05.460]   But then I don't think I have anything in there, so I'm not really worried.
[01:54:05.460 --> 01:54:07.460]   Say bye, bye, Google Play.
[01:54:07.460 --> 01:54:09.960]   Yeah, I'm loyal to Google.
[01:54:09.960 --> 01:54:14.460]   I live with me to Google, and even so, they don't invite me into the Pixel Club.
[01:54:14.460 --> 01:54:15.460]   Oh, my goodness.
[01:54:15.460 --> 01:54:16.460]   Keeps.
[01:54:16.460 --> 01:54:17.460]   Chef, you've been at Tabas.
[01:54:17.460 --> 01:54:18.460]   Come on, relax.
[01:54:18.460 --> 01:54:19.460]   Yeah.
[01:54:19.460 --> 01:54:22.460]   I'm going to make a TikTok about being pissed about not being in the Google Pixel Club.
[01:54:22.460 --> 01:54:25.460]   Google Camera 7.5 prepares new features.
[01:54:25.460 --> 01:54:28.460]   You'll be interested in this motion blur.
[01:54:28.460 --> 01:54:30.460]   And look, audio zooming.
[01:54:30.460 --> 01:54:31.460]   That's interesting.
[01:54:31.460 --> 01:54:32.460]   That's nice.
[01:54:32.460 --> 01:54:33.460]   Yeah.
[01:54:33.460 --> 01:54:35.460]   That's really cool.
[01:54:35.460 --> 01:54:36.460]   Kill.
[01:54:36.460 --> 01:54:39.460]   So this is from one of those APK breakdowns.
[01:54:39.460 --> 01:54:44.460]   So it's not out yet, but it will be coming soon to a camera near you.
[01:54:44.460 --> 01:54:46.460]   Google Live captioning feature.
[01:54:46.460 --> 01:54:50.460]   We've talked about that before, and I really love that.
[01:54:50.460 --> 01:54:54.460]   If you turn it on and you watch a YouTube video, Zach, it will kick back.
[01:54:54.460 --> 01:54:55.460]   Capture it.
[01:54:55.460 --> 01:54:56.460]   Does it solve Zach's problem?
[01:54:56.460 --> 01:54:59.460]   I don't know if it translates, but it will capture it.
[01:54:59.460 --> 01:55:02.460]   Maybe it captures the text, and I guess you could then run it through Translator.
[01:55:02.460 --> 01:55:04.460]   Maybe there'd be a way to do it manually.
[01:55:04.460 --> 01:55:06.460]   But now it's going to be--
[01:55:06.460 --> 01:55:07.460]   Oh, wait.
[01:55:07.460 --> 01:55:09.460]   What does Zach like to watch in Finland?
[01:55:09.460 --> 01:55:10.460]   Some guy?
[01:55:10.460 --> 01:55:12.460]   Some gaming thing, he said?
[01:55:12.460 --> 01:55:13.460]   Carsten.
[01:55:13.460 --> 01:55:14.460]   Oh, it's a gaming thing.
[01:55:14.460 --> 01:55:15.460]   Okay.
[01:55:15.460 --> 01:55:16.460]   Carsten will tell us.
[01:55:16.460 --> 01:55:17.460]   It's not in Finnish.
[01:55:17.460 --> 01:55:20.460]   Where was it?
[01:55:20.460 --> 01:55:23.460]   Oh, now it's going to be able to do your calls.
[01:55:23.460 --> 01:55:31.460]   So not only will it record the call, it will caption it, and you can save the text.
[01:55:31.460 --> 01:55:32.460]   So that's really cool.
[01:55:32.460 --> 01:55:35.460]   Here's a Dieter bone making a phone call.
[01:55:35.460 --> 01:55:38.460]   So Google just announced the Pixel 4a.
[01:55:38.460 --> 01:55:42.460]   It's a $350 phone that's getting released in August 20th.
[01:55:42.460 --> 01:55:45.460]   It has Google's amazing camera and also Google's other amazing software.
[01:55:45.460 --> 01:55:48.460]   One of the new features they've put in it is captioning for calls.
[01:55:48.460 --> 01:55:52.460]   So I'm going to try and show this to you, but it might cause some feedback.
[01:55:52.460 --> 01:55:53.460]   It's like-- it's tricky.
[01:55:53.460 --> 01:55:55.460]   So I'm going to call my iPhone from my Pixel phone.
[01:55:55.460 --> 01:55:58.460]   I'm going to answer the call on my iPhone.
[01:55:58.460 --> 01:56:00.460]   Sorry, I just don't want to show you--
[01:56:00.460 --> 01:56:01.460]   You have to get those boxes out of there.
[01:56:01.460 --> 01:56:03.460]   You're not going to do well.
[01:56:03.460 --> 01:56:04.460]   It's either.
[01:56:04.460 --> 01:56:07.460]   So calling the iPhone, it's on speaker.
[01:56:07.460 --> 01:56:09.460]   If you tap caption call here--
[01:56:09.460 --> 01:56:13.460]   Hi, the person you're about to speak with has call captions turned on.
[01:56:13.460 --> 01:56:14.460]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:56:14.460 --> 01:56:17.460]   They'll see captions of what you say to help them listen along.
[01:56:17.460 --> 01:56:19.460]   Great for deaf users.
[01:56:19.460 --> 01:56:25.460]   So now what happens when the person speaks to you on the other end, it gets closed captioned here on your phone in real time.
[01:56:25.460 --> 01:56:31.460]   So you can call somebody and they can just speak to you without having to use an intermediary system.
[01:56:31.460 --> 01:56:33.460]   And you're able to see what they are saying.
[01:56:33.460 --> 01:56:35.460]   Accessibility feature, isn't that great?
[01:56:35.460 --> 01:56:41.460]   I think this live captioning is just the reason they use a Pixel, to be honest.
[01:56:41.460 --> 01:56:42.460]   It's fantastic.
[01:56:42.460 --> 01:56:47.460]   Google Pay is going to launch bank accounts in 2021.
[01:56:47.460 --> 01:56:51.460]   We heard rumors for a long time.
[01:56:51.460 --> 01:57:02.460]   Eight banks in the US, BBVA, and BMO, among others, have announced they're going to partner with Google to offer digital first bank accounts directly in the Google Pay app.
[01:57:02.460 --> 01:57:05.460]   What does that mean, the digital first bank account?
[01:57:05.460 --> 01:57:07.460]   There's no branch, baby.
[01:57:07.460 --> 01:57:09.460]   It's all on your phone there.
[01:57:09.460 --> 01:57:10.460]   I've had it.
[01:57:10.460 --> 01:57:16.460]   Well, is it all on your phone or is it also-- I mean, I've had an internet only bank for a decade.
[01:57:16.460 --> 01:57:18.460]   Yeah, but now it's a Google Pay.
[01:57:18.460 --> 01:57:20.460]   Oh.
[01:57:20.460 --> 01:57:21.460]   City's going to do it.
[01:57:21.460 --> 01:57:26.460]   Stanford Federal Credit Union, bank mobile, coastal community bank, first independence bank.
[01:57:26.460 --> 01:57:28.460]   Yeah, I've had an internet only bank for a long time, too.
[01:57:28.460 --> 01:57:29.460]   It's great.
[01:57:29.460 --> 01:57:30.460]   You can go to any ATM.
[01:57:30.460 --> 01:57:31.460]   They pay the ATM fees for me.
[01:57:31.460 --> 01:57:34.460]   I'm with the USA because they don't have ATMs.
[01:57:34.460 --> 01:57:35.460]   And I deposit checks.
[01:57:35.460 --> 01:57:39.460]   I've been depositing checks for years now, just by taking a picture of it on the phone.
[01:57:39.460 --> 01:57:41.460]   I love all of those features.
[01:57:41.460 --> 01:57:45.460]   But now it's the largest check you could do that with.
[01:57:45.460 --> 01:57:46.460]   How does that always?
[01:57:46.460 --> 01:57:47.460]   Wow.
[01:57:47.460 --> 01:57:48.460]   Wow.
[01:57:48.460 --> 01:57:49.460]   Yeah.
[01:57:49.460 --> 01:57:51.460]   Well, you get a lot of those, I know.
[01:57:51.460 --> 01:57:52.460]   Oh, man, I'm doing that every day.
[01:57:52.460 --> 01:57:53.460]   Are you kidding?
[01:57:53.460 --> 01:57:54.460]   Yeah.
[01:57:54.460 --> 01:57:57.460]   I can't wait till I get that big check from TikTok and Microsoft.
[01:57:57.460 --> 01:57:59.460]   That's going to be awesome.
[01:57:59.460 --> 01:58:00.460]   Gee, boy.
[01:58:00.460 --> 01:58:03.460]   Do you imagine you'll have to give a bunch of it to the treasure?
[01:58:03.460 --> 01:58:04.460]   To Mnuchin.
[01:58:04.460 --> 01:58:05.460]   That's all right.
[01:58:05.460 --> 01:58:06.460]   Stevie's a good friend.
[01:58:06.460 --> 01:58:08.460]   He'll kick me back over to the table.
[01:58:08.460 --> 01:58:09.460]   Gee, boy.
[01:58:09.460 --> 01:58:15.460]   It's getting stickers, smart replies, and a if search, a yiff search.
[01:58:15.460 --> 01:58:17.460]   Oh, and podcasts.
[01:58:17.460 --> 01:58:18.460]   What?
[01:58:18.460 --> 01:58:19.460]   What?
[01:58:19.460 --> 01:58:22.460]   It will suggest podcasts.
[01:58:22.460 --> 01:58:23.460]   Okay.
[01:58:23.460 --> 01:58:24.460]   Smart reply.
[01:58:24.460 --> 01:58:25.460]   I love it.
[01:58:25.460 --> 01:58:26.460]   Thank you, Gboard.
[01:58:26.460 --> 01:58:27.460]   Gboard's good.
[01:58:27.460 --> 01:58:31.460]   It's the default keyboard on the Pixel, but you can always install it on other Android
[01:58:31.460 --> 01:58:32.460]   phones.
[01:58:32.460 --> 01:58:37.460]   If you are a Stadia Pro subscriber, you have my deepest sympathies, but there's a little
[01:58:37.460 --> 01:58:40.460]   reward for free games this month.
[01:58:40.460 --> 01:58:41.460]   That's the good news.
[01:58:41.460 --> 01:58:42.460]   Here's the bad news.
[01:58:42.460 --> 01:58:50.460]   The games are Kona, Strange Brigade, Pro, and Metro 2033.
[01:58:50.460 --> 01:58:51.460]   Redux.
[01:58:51.460 --> 01:58:55.460]   And then some sort of music thing called just shapes and beats.
[01:58:55.460 --> 01:58:57.460]   You get what your pick is for.
[01:58:57.460 --> 01:58:59.460]   That sounds like something my daughter would like.
[01:58:59.460 --> 01:59:00.460]   Yeah.
[01:59:00.460 --> 01:59:01.460]   Just shapes and beats.
[01:59:01.460 --> 01:59:02.460]   That's it.
[01:59:02.460 --> 01:59:08.460]   I think when XCloud comes out, Google's going to go, oh, never mind.
[01:59:08.460 --> 01:59:09.460]   Lots of Chrome upgrades.
[01:59:09.460 --> 01:59:11.460]   I'll leave it to you to figure out what they are.
[01:59:11.460 --> 01:59:14.460]   And, oh, hey, did you hear this?
[01:59:14.460 --> 01:59:22.460]   Google is running a special super fans program for Pixel owners with exclusive perks and events
[01:59:22.460 --> 01:59:24.060]   in the US.
[01:59:24.060 --> 01:59:30.220]   The first rule of Pixel Super fans is you don't talk about it, Jeff.
[01:59:30.220 --> 01:59:32.300]   They're recruiting loyal customers.
[01:59:32.300 --> 01:59:33.460]   Admission grants access.
[01:59:33.460 --> 01:59:37.060]   Well, well, well, they miss some.
[01:59:37.060 --> 01:59:42.180]   If you've been selected, you'd receive an email invitation leading to a signup form.
[01:59:42.180 --> 01:59:43.660]   I should probably check my email.
[01:59:43.660 --> 01:59:46.060]   I was sitting there thinking the same thing.
[01:59:46.060 --> 01:59:48.500]   Dang, did I get something?
[01:59:48.500 --> 01:59:50.220]   I did check my email.
[01:59:50.220 --> 01:59:51.220]   It's not there.
[01:59:51.220 --> 01:59:53.140]   I'm so pissed.
[01:59:53.140 --> 01:59:55.060]   Aww.
[01:59:55.060 --> 01:59:57.060]   If I had it, I'd give it to you.
[01:59:57.060 --> 02:00:00.220]   I'm sure you're not allowed to.
[02:00:00.220 --> 02:00:01.220]   Super fans.
[02:00:01.220 --> 02:00:04.820]   What, just search for super fans?
[02:00:04.820 --> 02:00:06.460]   Let me just search just in case.
[02:00:06.460 --> 02:00:07.460]   I'm going to be funny.
[02:00:07.460 --> 02:00:10.460]   I'm going to be funny if you had it.
[02:00:10.460 --> 02:00:11.460]   No.
[02:00:11.460 --> 02:00:12.460]   I did.
[02:00:12.460 --> 02:00:13.460]   Nope.
[02:00:13.460 --> 02:00:18.460]   Google Files has added and it's not, I looked on mine.
[02:00:18.460 --> 02:00:20.740]   It's not there yet, but you will get it soon.
[02:00:20.740 --> 02:00:23.260]   A new safe folder.
[02:00:23.260 --> 02:00:24.260]   This is good.
[02:00:24.260 --> 02:00:25.260]   I think this is a great idea.
[02:00:25.260 --> 02:00:27.140]   So, Google Files is a little files manager.
[02:00:27.140 --> 02:00:31.220]   The nice thing about safe folder is if you share your phone and you let others access
[02:00:31.220 --> 02:00:32.220]   it.
[02:00:32.220 --> 02:00:36.340]   And that's the focus they're doing because people are doing homeschooling and maybe,
[02:00:36.340 --> 02:00:40.020]   maybe, juniors using your phone.
[02:00:40.020 --> 02:00:41.380]   You can have a safe folder.
[02:00:41.380 --> 02:00:43.700]   This is another nice school feature.
[02:00:43.700 --> 02:00:49.420]   The family bell that will ring in, because, you know, when you go to school, there's a
[02:00:49.420 --> 02:00:51.100]   bell that says go to class, right?
[02:00:51.100 --> 02:00:52.100]   Yeah.
[02:00:52.100 --> 02:00:53.340]   That will ring in your house.
[02:00:53.340 --> 02:00:57.220]   When it's time to start an online class, take a break settling for reading time, have
[02:00:57.220 --> 02:00:58.220]   a snack.
[02:00:58.220 --> 02:00:59.220]   Reeses.
[02:00:59.220 --> 02:01:05.340]   So, I have to do, as you say, hey, you know who create a family bell and includes suggested
[02:01:05.340 --> 02:01:08.340]   bells or you could add some of your own.
[02:01:08.340 --> 02:01:10.820]   What goes off on everybody's phone at the same time?
[02:01:10.820 --> 02:01:11.820]   Yeah.
[02:01:11.820 --> 02:01:15.580]   Well, you can have different bells go off at the same time on different devices.
[02:01:15.580 --> 02:01:16.580]   Right.
[02:01:16.580 --> 02:01:20.020]   So, you can get to know your particular bell.
[02:01:20.020 --> 02:01:25.140]   This is rolling out in the US, Canada, UK, Australia and India, but it's rolling out.
[02:01:25.140 --> 02:01:26.820]   So, I checked.
[02:01:26.820 --> 02:01:27.980]   I was hoping to have this.
[02:01:27.980 --> 02:01:30.540]   I don't need it, but anyway.
[02:01:30.540 --> 02:01:34.860]   And then the safe folder is another feature that they kind of say is about getting ready
[02:01:34.860 --> 02:01:41.420]   for school because others might be using your phone or your device, your tablet.
[02:01:41.420 --> 02:01:48.580]   So there'll be a pin encrypted safe folder built into Google files.
[02:01:48.580 --> 02:01:55.660]   And that's the Google change log.
[02:01:55.660 --> 02:02:00.260]   Ladies and gentlemen, prepare your picks of the week.
[02:02:00.260 --> 02:02:02.980]   Jeff, do your number thing.
[02:02:02.980 --> 02:02:05.300]   We're going to take a little break when we come back.
[02:02:05.300 --> 02:02:11.300]   We'll wrap things up with Jeff Stacey and Anthony.
[02:02:11.300 --> 02:02:13.980]   Our show today brought to you by Monday.com.
[02:02:13.980 --> 02:02:15.500]   We're using Monday.com more and more.
[02:02:15.500 --> 02:02:17.580]   I just love Monday.com.
[02:02:17.580 --> 02:02:21.780]   If you have a team and nowadays, most teams are spread out, right?
[02:02:21.780 --> 02:02:23.300]   Everybody's a different place.
[02:02:23.300 --> 02:02:24.820]   You need a way to manage them.
[02:02:24.820 --> 02:02:27.620]   I want you to look at Monday.com.
[02:02:27.620 --> 02:02:32.960]   It's a team management platform that lets teams plan, manage and track work in one central
[02:02:32.960 --> 02:02:34.340]  ized place.
[02:02:34.340 --> 02:02:36.340]   One version of truth.
[02:02:36.340 --> 02:02:38.020]   It lets you collaborate with your teammates.
[02:02:38.020 --> 02:02:41.300]   You could track everything everybody's working on.
[02:02:41.300 --> 02:02:43.940]   And they have templates for every industry.
[02:02:43.940 --> 02:02:46.220]   They even have a podcast template.
[02:02:46.220 --> 02:02:48.140]   And it's great for big teams or little teams.
[02:02:48.140 --> 02:02:53.060]   Five to five thousand Monday.com is the easiest way to keep everybody connected to an on track,
[02:02:53.060 --> 02:02:55.960]   especially with so many people working from home.
[02:02:55.960 --> 02:02:59.980]   This is a project management platform that makes effective teamwork possible anywhere.
[02:02:59.980 --> 02:03:06.840]   The beauty part of Monday.com is it imports everything from all of your places automatically.
[02:03:06.840 --> 02:03:09.640]   In fact, there's no code automation.
[02:03:09.640 --> 02:03:12.200]   So you can put your workflow on autopilot.
[02:03:12.200 --> 02:03:13.440]   It's automatically up to date.
[02:03:13.440 --> 02:03:16.160]   You'll get alerts, automatic status updates.
[02:03:16.160 --> 02:03:20.080]   Project flows will keep your team on track and confident in their work.
[02:03:20.080 --> 02:03:22.840]   You could choose how it looks.
[02:03:22.840 --> 02:03:26.320]   So if you like Gantt charts, I know you like Pertcharts there, Stacey.
[02:03:26.320 --> 02:03:30.240]   You could do a timeline, a can band, spreadsheet tables.
[02:03:30.240 --> 02:03:32.940]   Monday.com does it all.
[02:03:32.940 --> 02:03:33.940]   Now I know what you're thinking.
[02:03:33.940 --> 02:03:36.380]   Oh, I don't want to spend hours getting it all set up.
[02:03:36.380 --> 02:03:37.380]   You don't have to.
[02:03:37.380 --> 02:03:42.260]   It comes out of the box ready to go, ready to increase your productivity and efficiency.
[02:03:42.260 --> 02:03:43.700]   You could tweak it as you go.
[02:03:43.700 --> 02:03:47.100]   They've got templates for every industry.
[02:03:47.100 --> 02:03:50.180]   Timelines, budgets, project managers.
[02:03:50.180 --> 02:03:56.300]   And then the beauty part is they've got onboarding specialists at Monday.com.
[02:03:56.300 --> 02:04:00.560]   We had Eddie, who will say, oh, I like where you go here.
[02:04:00.560 --> 02:04:01.640]   But what about this?
[02:04:01.640 --> 02:04:03.640]   He will even sit down and do it for you.
[02:04:03.640 --> 02:04:05.320]   Or she, it's awesome.
[02:04:05.320 --> 02:04:10.960]   Works with Zoom, or Slack, email, calendar, spreadsheet, everything you use.
[02:04:10.960 --> 02:04:12.080]   It goes in there.
[02:04:12.080 --> 02:04:17.960]   If you're the boss, you can make data-driven decisions because it's a dashboard for you.
[02:04:17.960 --> 02:04:22.640]   You could track progress and timelines and budgets and know exactly what's going on instead
[02:04:22.640 --> 02:04:24.000]   of guessing.
[02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:28.280]   One version of the truth, centralized communications eliminates meetings.
[02:04:28.280 --> 02:04:33.440]   When we go back from home to the office, I'm still going to use Monday.com because who
[02:04:33.440 --> 02:04:34.760]   wants to go to meetings?
[02:04:34.760 --> 02:04:39.100]   It's great to know exactly what's going on at any given time with everybody on your
[02:04:39.100 --> 02:04:40.100]   team.
[02:04:40.100 --> 02:04:45.660]   No wonder 100,000 teams are already getting things done every day with Monday.com.
[02:04:45.660 --> 02:04:53.560]   They even have a podcast section that is ready made for us, for all of our shows.
[02:04:53.560 --> 02:04:55.280]   It's really cool.
[02:04:55.280 --> 02:05:00.120]   I think you should change the way you work and do it online with a centralized, single
[02:05:00.120 --> 02:05:03.400]   version of the truth so you know exactly what's going on.
[02:05:03.400 --> 02:05:06.440]   Let Monday.com take care of what slows you down.
[02:05:06.440 --> 02:05:11.920]   Free up time to focus on the work that gets your juices going in the morning.
[02:05:11.920 --> 02:05:18.280]   I love getting up, seeing the board, adding things to it, watching it develop over time.

[02:05:20.360 --> 02:05:22.680]   Go to Monday.com/twit.
[02:05:22.680 --> 02:05:29.160]   We thank them so much for their support.
[02:05:29.160 --> 02:05:33.000]   Great company, great people with a really cool product.
[02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:34.000]   Monday.com/twit.
[02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:38.040]   Did you see Alphabet by the way, I forgot to mention this.
[02:05:38.040 --> 02:05:40.600]   This could be your number, Jeff.
[02:05:40.600 --> 02:05:42.120]   Borrowed $10 billion.
[02:05:42.120 --> 02:05:43.120]   Borrowed.
[02:05:43.120 --> 02:05:46.120]   What do they need to borrow for?
[02:05:46.120 --> 02:05:47.560]   Well you might ask the same thing of Apple.
[02:05:47.560 --> 02:05:49.320]   This is the new corporate thing.
[02:05:49.320 --> 02:05:50.320]   You're rolling in the dough.
[02:05:50.320 --> 02:05:51.760]   You got plenty of cash.
[02:05:51.760 --> 02:05:52.760]   Guess what?
[02:05:52.760 --> 02:05:56.040]   People want bonds from you and you can get incredibly low rates.
[02:05:56.040 --> 02:05:58.040]   Might as well just borrow the money.
[02:05:58.040 --> 02:05:59.040]   Money's cracking.
[02:05:59.040 --> 02:06:00.800]   Yeah, when money's free, you take it.
[02:06:00.800 --> 02:06:01.800]   Take it.
[02:06:01.800 --> 02:06:03.400]   Especially when times are uncertain like this.
[02:06:03.400 --> 02:06:04.400]   Yep.
[02:06:04.400 --> 02:06:06.120]   That's why we bought a house.
[02:06:06.120 --> 02:06:07.360]   Money was free.
[02:06:07.360 --> 02:06:09.760]   So where do I find this for you?
[02:06:09.760 --> 02:06:11.880]   You got to be a multinational.
[02:06:11.880 --> 02:06:12.880]   Sorry.
[02:06:12.880 --> 02:06:15.440]   What's a 30-year mortgage run in these days?
[02:06:15.440 --> 02:06:18.120]   Do they at least have samples?
[02:06:18.120 --> 02:06:21.600]   Mine was like three or two point nine.
[02:06:21.600 --> 02:06:22.600]   Wow.
[02:06:22.600 --> 02:06:25.600]   It was ridiculously ridiculous.
[02:06:25.600 --> 02:06:28.400]   Although I'm not on a 30-year mortgage.
[02:06:28.400 --> 02:06:30.600]   I was 17 once or something like this ridiculous.
[02:06:30.600 --> 02:06:34.000]   You want to know what the coupon was on the Google bond?
[02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:35.000]   Point.
[02:06:35.000 --> 02:06:36.960]   They a little bit better than you're getting.
[02:06:36.960 --> 02:06:38.920]   Point four or five percent.
[02:06:38.920 --> 02:06:39.920]   Jeez.
[02:06:39.920 --> 02:06:41.920]   That's as close to free as you can get.
[02:06:41.920 --> 02:06:42.920]   Yeah.
[02:06:42.920 --> 02:06:45.160]   And by the way, they sold it out.
[02:06:45.160 --> 02:06:46.160]   Yeah.
[02:06:46.160 --> 02:06:47.160]   They're probably callable.
[02:06:47.160 --> 02:06:51.120]   They're probably in front in that stitch.
[02:06:51.120 --> 02:06:52.120]   Nice job.
[02:06:52.120 --> 02:06:54.440]   The lowest coupon prior to this.
[02:06:54.440 --> 02:06:55.840]   1.25 percent.
[02:06:55.840 --> 02:06:57.240]   That was back in 2014.
[02:06:57.240 --> 02:06:59.960]   Now it's point four or five percent.
[02:06:59.960 --> 02:07:00.960]   All right.
[02:07:00.960 --> 02:07:01.960]   But that's not Jeff's number.
[02:07:01.960 --> 02:07:02.960]   That was mine number.
[02:07:02.960 --> 02:07:03.960]   Let's start with the...
[02:07:03.960 --> 02:07:05.360]   Hey, we never start with Ant.
[02:07:05.360 --> 02:07:07.160]   Let's start with Ant's pick of the week.
[02:07:07.160 --> 02:07:08.160]   Yeah.
[02:07:08.160 --> 02:07:09.160]   Yeah.
[02:07:09.160 --> 02:07:10.160]   Yeah.
[02:07:10.160 --> 02:07:11.160]   Yeah.
[02:07:11.160 --> 02:07:13.360]   My pick of the week, I think I had three in there.
[02:07:13.360 --> 02:07:14.960]   But I'll make sure you put it.
[02:07:14.960 --> 02:07:15.960]   Overachiever.
[02:07:15.960 --> 02:07:16.960]   Um.
[02:07:16.960 --> 02:07:21.080]   First off, I know everybody just...
[02:07:21.080 --> 02:07:22.920]   They love your wood.
[02:07:22.920 --> 02:07:23.920]   Yeah.
[02:07:23.920 --> 02:07:28.320]   I know people are trying to do more things with their photography nowadays with them
[02:07:28.320 --> 02:07:29.960]   being sheltered in place and whatnot.
[02:07:29.960 --> 02:07:36.280]   And money is a bit of a problem with photography because photography can be rather expensive.
[02:07:36.280 --> 02:07:41.240]   But I needed some new backdrops for portraits.
[02:07:41.240 --> 02:07:45.080]   And I typically would order from different photography shops.
[02:07:45.080 --> 02:07:46.920]   And I said, "Nah, let me look around."
[02:07:46.920 --> 02:07:50.000]   And sure enough, my friend told me about Michaels.
[02:07:50.000 --> 02:07:51.000]   What the what?
[02:07:51.000 --> 02:07:53.800]   And they have photography backdrops.
[02:07:53.800 --> 02:07:58.240]   They're not photography backdrops, but they work just as well.
[02:07:58.240 --> 02:08:02.240]   And they're about a third of the cost of what I would pay elsewhere.
[02:08:02.240 --> 02:08:08.560]   $9.49 for this beautiful, weathered wood four feet by...
[02:08:08.560 --> 02:08:10.240]   What did you say, 12 feet?
[02:08:10.240 --> 02:08:11.240]   Yep.
[02:08:11.240 --> 02:08:12.560]   Four feet by 12 feet long.
[02:08:12.560 --> 02:08:15.120]   And I'm using one right now if you're watching the video.
[02:08:15.120 --> 02:08:16.120]   That was real.
[02:08:16.120 --> 02:08:17.120]   Um.
[02:08:17.120 --> 02:08:18.600]   And it just looks like real wood back behind me.
[02:08:18.600 --> 02:08:24.000]   And I got three or four different versions that I'm going to use and just easily wrap
[02:08:24.000 --> 02:08:27.320]   them up and throw them up on my little C stand.
[02:08:27.320 --> 02:08:29.400]   You can see behind me there.
[02:08:29.400 --> 02:08:30.400]   I just got on.
[02:08:30.400 --> 02:08:31.400]   Oh, yeah, look at that.
[02:08:31.400 --> 02:08:33.880]   Right up there on the C stand.
[02:08:33.880 --> 02:08:38.680]   But if you look at me working, you'd never know that that was a backdrop.
[02:08:38.680 --> 02:08:43.120]   So I want to get this underwater one for my next zoom call.
[02:08:43.120 --> 02:08:44.120]   That's awesome.
[02:08:44.120 --> 02:08:50.600]   Please do that and where the goggles to.
[02:08:50.600 --> 02:08:51.600]   I will.
[02:08:51.600 --> 02:08:52.600]   I will.
[02:08:52.600 --> 02:08:57.960]   And then my other one is everybody knows I'm into Adobe because that's just what I
[02:08:57.960 --> 02:08:58.960]   like.
[02:08:58.960 --> 02:09:00.800]   But there are some other products out there.
[02:09:00.800 --> 02:09:05.560]   Vegas is another creative product for creating video.
[02:09:05.560 --> 02:09:06.560]   Yeah.
[02:09:06.560 --> 02:09:07.560]   Very well known.
[02:09:07.560 --> 02:09:09.240]   Well, I've used their editors.
[02:09:09.240 --> 02:09:10.480]   That's what you're talking about, right?
[02:09:10.480 --> 02:09:11.480]   Yep.
[02:09:11.480 --> 02:09:14.120]   I've used this editor is version 18.
[02:09:14.120 --> 02:09:15.120]   You just come out.
[02:09:15.120 --> 02:09:16.920]   Is it still Sony or are they?
[02:09:16.920 --> 02:09:19.560]   Yeah, Sony used to be on them.
[02:09:19.560 --> 02:09:21.920]   I think somebody else looks like somebody else.
[02:09:21.920 --> 02:09:22.920]   Yeah.
[02:09:22.920 --> 02:09:23.920]   Yeah.
[02:09:23.920 --> 02:09:24.920]   Nice.
[02:09:24.920 --> 02:09:29.280]   And price wise, it's going to be about half the price of a creative cloud subscription.
[02:09:29.280 --> 02:09:34.440]   I believe you can get it for $25 a month or just pay a thousand bucks a year.
[02:09:34.440 --> 02:09:40.240]   So if you're not interested in getting a Adobe subscription, Vegas is another good option
[02:09:40.240 --> 02:09:41.240]   out there.
[02:09:41.240 --> 02:09:45.040]   So we'll have links in the show notes to get to checking out.
[02:09:45.040 --> 02:09:46.040]   For what?
[02:09:46.040 --> 02:09:49.520]   I thought that they weren't like timeline based, but it looks like just regular timeline
[02:09:49.520 --> 02:09:50.520]   editing.
[02:09:50.520 --> 02:09:51.520]   So yeah, they are.
[02:09:51.520 --> 02:09:52.520]   You already know.
[02:09:52.520 --> 02:09:53.520]   You have Premiere Pro.
[02:09:53.520 --> 02:09:59.440]   You have DaVinci with Blackmagic, but people tend to forget about Vegas and it's.
[02:09:59.440 --> 02:10:04.880]   Sorry about that.
[02:10:04.880 --> 02:10:08.720]   They have all of the same effects and the same tools that you're used to in the other
[02:10:08.720 --> 02:10:13.920]   editors, but again, AI generated so it makes a lot of things faster and easier to work
[02:10:13.920 --> 02:10:14.920]   with.
[02:10:14.920 --> 02:10:21.240]   So that's an option if you don't want to jump on the Adobe creative cloud chain.
[02:10:21.240 --> 02:10:26.080]   And you said you had three number three after hours.
[02:10:26.080 --> 02:10:29.880]   Oh, I'm glad you're promoting this because you're in it.
[02:10:29.880 --> 02:10:32.160]   Yeah, I was in the winter.
[02:10:32.160 --> 02:10:34.400]   We're cooking.
[02:10:34.400 --> 02:10:40.240]   And this time I've been sent some ingredients, but I can't see what they are just yet.
[02:10:40.240 --> 02:10:45.360]   All I know is I did not have to put the ingredients in the refrigerator and I got the ingredients
[02:10:45.360 --> 02:10:46.360]   on Monday.
[02:10:46.360 --> 02:10:49.280]   What a bizarre.
[02:10:49.280 --> 02:10:50.280]   They're just dry.
[02:10:50.280 --> 02:10:53.320]   Remember last time it was escargot.
[02:10:53.320 --> 02:10:59.680]   No, the polys cactuses and chipped beef and a kick.
[02:10:59.680 --> 02:11:04.680]   And jackfruit or drag.
[02:11:04.680 --> 02:11:08.360]   That was a lot of fun, but I have no idea what these ingredients are.
[02:11:08.360 --> 02:11:13.040]   I put a link in the rundown to show that I guess you said I'm getting serious.
[02:11:13.040 --> 02:11:17.000]   I set up the kitchen to try to make it a little more interactive.
[02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:21.280]   I thought I did a pretty good job last time, but I think this is going to be even better.
[02:11:21.280 --> 02:11:23.120]   So that was the test.
[02:11:23.120 --> 02:11:27.440]   How does Queen Queen Pruitt feel about all his crap in the kitchen?
[02:11:27.440 --> 02:11:29.000]   Oh, no, she's cool with it.
[02:11:29.000 --> 02:11:30.000]   She's very nice.
[02:11:30.000 --> 02:11:33.120]   She's doing an Aisha Curry where she's like, I'm cooking up a storm.
[02:11:33.120 --> 02:11:36.360]   She's got the personality of somebody who could be like engaging.
[02:11:36.360 --> 02:11:40.800]   She's totally cool with me doing this stuff just for that reason right there.
[02:11:40.800 --> 02:11:44.480]   Just in case she's ready to create something on Snapchat or whatever.
[02:11:44.480 --> 02:11:45.480]   She knows.
[02:11:45.480 --> 02:11:47.400]   Yeah, I can do it.
[02:11:47.400 --> 02:11:50.280]   That's 4 p.m. on Friday Pacific 7 p.m.

[02:11:56.440 --> 02:12:02.160]   But you, Amanda Hess from our Ham Nation show and...
[02:12:02.160 --> 02:12:03.560]   Cooking Ham, I would guess.
[02:12:03.560 --> 02:12:04.920]   I hope she does.
[02:12:04.920 --> 02:12:08.360]   And Lou Maresca from This Week in Enterprise Tech.
[02:12:08.360 --> 02:12:09.720]   He's an Italian cook.
[02:12:09.720 --> 02:12:11.640]   He's very good.
[02:12:11.640 --> 02:12:12.640]   He's getting loose.
[02:12:12.640 --> 02:12:13.880]   He's got my word.
[02:12:13.880 --> 02:12:14.880]   Yeah.
[02:12:14.880 --> 02:12:15.880]   Yeah.
[02:12:15.880 --> 02:12:17.640]   And Lou has five boys, something like that.
[02:12:17.640 --> 02:12:21.080]   He knows how to whip up a lot of food.
[02:12:21.080 --> 02:12:25.480]   But again, I can show you the box.
[02:12:25.480 --> 02:12:27.080]   How big is it?
[02:12:27.080 --> 02:12:28.080]   So these are the ingredients.
[02:12:28.080 --> 02:12:29.200]   Is it bigger than a bread box?
[02:12:29.200 --> 02:12:30.200]   Two celebrity judges too.
[02:12:30.200 --> 02:12:31.200]   Smaller than our refrigerator.
[02:12:31.200 --> 02:12:32.200]   It's going to be fun.
[02:12:32.200 --> 02:12:33.200]   Oh, it's not that big.
[02:12:33.200 --> 02:12:34.200]   It's from Amazon.
[02:12:34.200 --> 02:12:35.200]   Not that big.
[02:12:35.200 --> 02:12:36.200]   That's it.
[02:12:36.200 --> 02:12:39.200]   So what the heck is in here that I don't have to put in a refrigerator?
[02:12:39.200 --> 02:12:40.200]   Ariesa Spice.
[02:12:40.200 --> 02:12:41.200]   Come on.
[02:12:41.200 --> 02:12:42.200]   Ariesa.
[02:12:42.200 --> 02:12:44.160]   What is this going to be?
[02:12:44.160 --> 02:12:48.680]   So I'm a little nervous because Mr. Nielsen, our producer and director, he's pretty cruel.
[02:12:48.680 --> 02:12:50.040]   About like Mr. Carston.
[02:12:50.040 --> 02:12:51.040]   He's mean.
[02:12:51.040 --> 02:12:53.960]   Back by popular demand.
[02:12:53.960 --> 02:12:59.720]   It's round two of Twit After Hours Shelter in Kitchen.

[02:13:37.880 --> 02:13:42.240]   so pick one or do you want a tech appropriate be treat?

[02:13:44.880 --> 02:13:45.880]   A.
[02:13:45.880 --> 02:13:46.880]   A cookbook.
[02:13:46.880 --> 02:13:47.880]   Cookbook.
[02:13:47.880 --> 02:13:48.880]   Brave tart.
[02:13:48.880 --> 02:13:49.880]   Y'all.
[02:13:49.880 --> 02:13:50.880]   Brave tart.
[02:13:50.880 --> 02:13:52.880]   There's no male Gibson involved.
[02:13:52.880 --> 02:13:57.760]   It is nothing to do with milk Gibson.
[02:13:57.760 --> 02:14:02.160]   This is, I can't think of her name right now, but she's a pastry chef.
[02:14:02.160 --> 02:14:04.200]   She's part of the Kenji Lopez Ult crew.
[02:14:04.200 --> 02:14:05.200]   Oh, I love it.
[02:14:05.200 --> 02:14:06.200]   I like super researchy.
[02:14:06.200 --> 02:14:07.200]   Yeah.
[02:14:07.200 --> 02:14:10.720]   And so the recipes are awesome and a bit over the top.
[02:14:10.720 --> 02:14:14.240]   Some of them are like she has a homemade sprinkles recipe that I'm never going to do, but she
[02:14:14.240 --> 02:14:17.320]   also has lots of really accessible recipes that you can do.
[02:14:17.320 --> 02:14:18.880]   And the best part about.
[02:14:18.880 --> 02:14:19.880]   Still a part.
[02:14:19.880 --> 02:14:21.480]   Yes, still a parks.
[02:14:21.480 --> 02:14:27.560]   The best part about this whole book is it has these wonderful essays where she researches
[02:14:27.560 --> 02:14:32.840]   and talks about the historical origins of things like chocolate chip cookies or white
[02:14:32.840 --> 02:14:37.080]   cake versus yellow cake or oatmeal cream pies.
[02:14:37.080 --> 02:14:38.920]   It's awesome.
[02:14:38.920 --> 02:14:43.040]   It's like food history, awesome dessert recipes.
[02:14:43.040 --> 02:14:49.240]   And I mean, even if you never cook, those, those essays make it so worthwhile if you're
[02:14:49.240 --> 02:14:52.920]   interested in like the history of food or oh, it's awesome.
[02:14:52.920 --> 02:14:55.280]   But does she go in?
[02:14:55.280 --> 02:14:59.520]   That's that's my versus cake.
[02:14:59.520 --> 02:15:05.120]   So she, she, if you got a brave tart.com, it's the ad for the book and you'll find some
[02:15:05.120 --> 02:15:06.120]   of her stuff.
[02:15:06.120 --> 02:15:10.400]   She writes on food 52 and other stuff, but like y'all.
[02:15:10.400 --> 02:15:12.480]   This cookbook is just awesome.
[02:15:12.480 --> 02:15:17.880]   A friend of mine gave it to me as a housewarming present and it's really worth it.
[02:15:17.880 --> 02:15:20.960]   Like I don't care if you'd like to cook or not.
[02:15:20.960 --> 02:15:23.640]   This looks like a great book.
[02:15:23.640 --> 02:15:30.480]   Stella Parks, P-A-R-K-S, Brave Tart, one word, bravetart.com for more information.
[02:15:30.480 --> 02:15:35.880]   I know it's not connected, but we're going to make home-made oatmeal cream pies and like
[02:15:35.880 --> 02:15:37.960]   that was my childhood right there.
[02:15:37.960 --> 02:15:38.960]   Like totally.
[02:15:38.960 --> 02:15:43.160]   And she had a whole essay on them and I learned all about where they came from, why they
[02:15:43.160 --> 02:15:47.200]   were invented, what like food trends were happening.
[02:15:47.200 --> 02:15:49.000]   Nom, nom, nom, nom.
[02:15:49.000 --> 02:15:52.200]   And I like it that she has a chocolate chip cookie in her pocket.
[02:15:52.200 --> 02:16:00.760]   Mine wouldn't last, but I know that's, she must, she must start eating a half dozen.
[02:16:00.760 --> 02:16:06.040]   I am wearing my avocado mask that beautifully matches my avocado shirt.
[02:16:06.040 --> 02:16:08.320]   I wanted to give a big plug.
[02:16:08.320 --> 02:16:11.000]   Thank you, Wynton Churchill who sent this to me.
[02:16:11.000 --> 02:16:16.920]   It's from Abrazos, which is a store in San Miguel, De Iende, Mexico.
[02:16:16.920 --> 02:16:19.400]   Sanmigueldesigns.com.
[02:16:19.400 --> 02:16:25.760]   These are the seamstresses of San Miguel, De Iende and Abrazos.
[02:16:25.760 --> 02:16:33.120]   And let me tell you the masks they have, they haven't for adults, they haven't for kids.
[02:16:33.120 --> 02:16:37.440]   They are in their most amazing, they have the most amazing fabrics.
[02:16:37.440 --> 02:16:39.640]   These are beautifully made masks.
[02:16:39.640 --> 02:16:45.600]   But the fabrics that they have, I mean, I want to just order a ton of fabrics from them.
[02:16:45.600 --> 02:16:49.840]   Pinatas, wouldn't you like a Virgin of Guadalupe mask?
[02:16:49.840 --> 02:16:52.680]   Nobody ever got sick wearing the Virgin of Guadalupe.
[02:16:52.680 --> 02:16:55.360]   I could tell you that right now.
[02:16:55.360 --> 02:16:57.640]   Just incredible stuff.
[02:16:57.640 --> 02:16:58.640]   Great Mexican heritage.
[02:16:58.640 --> 02:17:04.280]   Here's the De Iende de los Muertos and the skulls and so forth.
[02:17:04.280 --> 02:17:09.920]   It's Abrazos, it's Sanmigueldesigns.com.
[02:17:09.920 --> 02:17:14.000]   And I think I want to bring back style and masks.
[02:17:14.000 --> 02:17:16.800]   Get a shirt and a mask.
[02:17:16.800 --> 02:17:21.480]   And then you'll have matching, which I think is so cool.
[02:17:21.480 --> 02:17:23.840]   I just love it.
[02:17:23.840 --> 02:17:27.080]   Bonehead in chocolate, Lucha Libre purple.
[02:17:27.080 --> 02:17:28.080]   That's pretty awesome.
[02:17:28.080 --> 02:17:30.000]   Isn't that great blue pineapples?
[02:17:30.000 --> 02:17:33.240]   I like the picture of the team, this is just, isn't it?
[02:17:33.240 --> 02:17:34.800]   Aren't they cute?
[02:17:34.800 --> 02:17:37.840]   Don't you just say, oh, I want to send you some work.
[02:17:37.840 --> 02:17:40.520]   Look at them, some of them with their kids.
[02:17:40.520 --> 02:17:42.600]   Oh, I just love that.
[02:17:42.600 --> 02:17:44.560]   They hand painted furniture.
[02:17:44.560 --> 02:17:50.160]   I think that would, a little hand painted furniture would alive in Stacey's Skype.
[02:17:50.160 --> 02:17:51.680]   Oh, should we send her a chair?
[02:17:51.680 --> 02:17:52.880]   It could be a nice thing.
[02:17:52.880 --> 02:17:54.280]   Yeah, I think it could be good.
[02:17:54.280 --> 02:17:57.320]   I love these classic Mexican painted chairs.
[02:17:57.320 --> 02:17:59.200]   They're just beautiful.
[02:17:59.200 --> 02:18:00.560]   I just love it.
[02:18:00.560 --> 02:18:03.120]   She could hang the chair on the wall or whatever.
[02:18:03.120 --> 02:18:05.040]   Yeah, and you've got to see the shirts.
[02:18:05.040 --> 02:18:08.360]   That's where all my crazy shirts come from.
[02:18:08.360 --> 02:18:10.040]   They're really, really great.
[02:18:10.040 --> 02:18:12.600]   That's some good vibes there.
[02:18:12.600 --> 02:18:14.040]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:18:14.040 --> 02:18:18.960]   You might recognize some of these shirts because I haven't.
[02:18:18.960 --> 02:18:20.640]   I wonder why.
[02:18:20.640 --> 02:18:24.000]   Oh, look at that.
[02:18:24.000 --> 02:18:27.880]   There's a Cervesa shirt.
[02:18:27.880 --> 02:18:30.560]   Mr. Jeff Jarvis, a number, please.
[02:18:30.560 --> 02:18:34.360]   So I'll do bad news, good news, post COVID.
[02:18:34.360 --> 02:18:40.360]   The bad news is that Robert Crandall, former chief executive American Airlines, says that
[02:18:40.360 --> 02:18:44.840]   one third to one half of business travel will go away permanently.
[02:18:44.840 --> 02:18:48.800]   Permanently, because Zoom, people just got out of the habit.
[02:18:48.800 --> 02:18:49.800]   They don't need to do it.
[02:18:49.800 --> 02:18:50.800]   They're fine.
[02:18:50.800 --> 02:18:51.800]   That's the bad news.
[02:18:51.800 --> 02:18:53.560]   I thought you said because Zoom.
[02:18:53.560 --> 02:18:54.560]   And I was like, what?
[02:18:54.560 --> 02:18:55.560]   I did say.
[02:18:55.560 --> 02:18:58.240]   Because Zoom, because Zoom, because Zoom.
[02:18:58.240 --> 02:18:59.240]   You did.
[02:18:59.240 --> 02:19:01.040]   He's not making that up.
[02:19:01.040 --> 02:19:02.680]   I did say because Zoom.
[02:19:02.680 --> 02:19:04.680]   Zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom, zoom.
[02:19:04.680 --> 02:19:12.200]   So then the good news is that Patreon added more than 100,000 new users between mid-March
[02:19:12.200 --> 02:19:13.200]   and July.
[02:19:13.200 --> 02:19:17.880]   Only fans is reporting daily six-figure signups.
[02:19:17.880 --> 02:19:22.360]   Etsy logged 115,000 new sellers in the first three months of the year.
[02:19:22.360 --> 02:19:24.840]   All this thanks to one zero on Medium.
[02:19:24.840 --> 02:19:31.080]   For the double past year's user growth, Teachable signed on 14,000 new creators between March
[02:19:31.080 --> 02:19:32.080]   and July.
[02:19:32.080 --> 02:19:35.760]   And in July, reported its first quarterly revenue of $10 million.
[02:19:35.760 --> 02:19:40.520]   So the one zero's headline says that the gig economy is failing, say a little to the
[02:19:40.520 --> 02:19:41.520]   hustle economy.
[02:19:41.520 --> 02:19:43.040]   I don't know if it's a hustle economy.
[02:19:43.040 --> 02:19:44.960]   Well, I think it's a few people who are...
[02:19:44.960 --> 02:19:49.400]   A lot of these people are signing up hoping that they can supplement their income with
[02:19:49.400 --> 02:19:50.400]   donations.
[02:19:50.400 --> 02:19:52.440]   It doesn't mean they're getting the donations.
[02:19:52.440 --> 02:19:54.760]   And that's what really worries me.
[02:19:54.760 --> 02:19:57.920]   Well, except for...
[02:19:57.920 --> 02:19:59.080]   Etsy is not donations.
[02:19:59.080 --> 02:20:00.080]   Etsy is making things.
[02:20:00.080 --> 02:20:01.080]   No, that's true.
[02:20:01.080 --> 02:20:02.080]   Yeah.
[02:20:02.080 --> 02:20:05.480]   And Teachable is in so much donation as a fee for service.
[02:20:05.480 --> 02:20:06.480]   Right.
[02:20:06.480 --> 02:20:07.480]   Patreon is donations.
[02:20:07.480 --> 02:20:11.120]   But Teachable, you got to get people signed up.
[02:20:11.120 --> 02:20:12.120]   I'm huge.
[02:20:12.120 --> 02:20:13.120]   You got to get...
[02:20:13.120 --> 02:20:14.120]   Later classes.
[02:20:14.120 --> 02:20:15.120]   You got to market.
[02:20:15.120 --> 02:20:16.120]   Yeah.
[02:20:16.120 --> 02:20:17.120]   Do you use only fans?
[02:20:17.120 --> 02:20:18.120]   Have you got them to that?
[02:20:18.120 --> 02:20:19.120]   I don't really know only fans.
[02:20:19.120 --> 02:20:20.880]   Isn't that for porn?
[02:20:20.880 --> 02:20:21.880]   I think it is.
[02:20:21.880 --> 02:20:22.880]   What?
[02:20:22.880 --> 02:20:23.880]   Well, really?
[02:20:23.880 --> 02:20:24.880]   I think it's only porn.
[02:20:24.880 --> 02:20:26.680]   I don't think it's only porn.
[02:20:26.680 --> 02:20:30.040]   Don't show my screen.
[02:20:30.040 --> 02:20:31.880]   This is for research purposes only.
[02:20:31.880 --> 02:20:32.880]   Yeah.
[02:20:32.880 --> 02:20:37.640]   I've heard it been tied more towards...
[02:20:37.640 --> 02:20:39.480]   I think it could be anything.
[02:20:39.480 --> 02:20:40.480]   But I think it could be anything.
[02:20:40.480 --> 02:20:41.480]   We're all like...
[02:20:41.480 --> 02:20:45.080]   Well, when you mentioned only fans, I'm like, "Well, go Jeff.
[02:20:45.080 --> 02:20:47.560]   That is very forward-looking to that be part of it.
[02:20:47.560 --> 02:20:51.320]   But yeah, I think it's mostly camgirls.
[02:20:51.320 --> 02:20:52.320]   I think it's a lot of camgirls.
[02:20:52.320 --> 02:20:54.200]   But I think it'd be other things as well."
[02:20:54.200 --> 02:20:57.440]   See, I thought having made my first-time talk, maybe I'd go on only fans.
[02:20:57.440 --> 02:20:58.440]   Here's somebody there.
[02:20:58.440 --> 02:20:59.440]   But I don't think so.
[02:20:59.440 --> 02:21:01.440]   Here's my workout video, things like that.
[02:21:01.440 --> 02:21:02.440]   You should see...
[02:21:02.440 --> 02:21:04.520]   I mean, maybe you could find an audience there, Jeff.
[02:21:04.520 --> 02:21:05.760]   You'd never do.
[02:21:05.760 --> 02:21:07.000]   True.
[02:21:07.000 --> 02:21:09.200]   The world is wide and varied.
[02:21:09.200 --> 02:21:10.200]   Yes, it is.
[02:21:10.200 --> 02:21:11.200]   Yes, it is.
[02:21:11.200 --> 02:21:12.200]   And I...
[02:21:12.200 --> 02:21:13.680]   It's a word that it evens for me.
[02:21:13.680 --> 02:21:16.800]   Have an obligation to help...
[02:21:16.800 --> 02:21:19.840]   Well, first of all, we've got to do Carson's Mask of the Week.
[02:21:19.840 --> 02:21:21.840]   Which one do you want me to do, Carson?
[02:21:21.840 --> 02:21:25.960]   This is a 3D printed mask with filters.
[02:21:25.960 --> 02:21:27.960]   This is from Etsy.
[02:21:27.960 --> 02:21:30.880]   Carson has a little bit of a dystopian bent to him.
[02:21:30.880 --> 02:21:31.880]   No, really?
[02:21:31.880 --> 02:21:36.200]   So this is basically a Bane mask.
[02:21:36.200 --> 02:21:38.280]   I don't think I'd really want to wear it.
[02:21:38.280 --> 02:21:42.240]   I saw a small child wearing the traditional plague mask.
[02:21:42.240 --> 02:21:43.240]   Plague mask.
[02:21:43.240 --> 02:21:45.000]   Yeah, he made us all plague masks.
[02:21:45.000 --> 02:21:46.000]   Yeah.
[02:21:46.000 --> 02:21:47.000]   Wow.
[02:21:47.000 --> 02:21:51.360]   Here's a shot of Carson wearing the mask.
[02:21:51.360 --> 02:21:53.120]   What do you got?
[02:21:53.120 --> 02:21:54.120]   What is...
[02:21:54.120 --> 02:21:55.120]   I don't want to...
[02:21:55.120 --> 02:21:56.120]   Oh, there he is.
[02:21:56.120 --> 02:21:57.120]   Yeah, you get a pair of old geez.
[02:21:57.120 --> 02:21:58.920]   Goes well with a bow-tight, Carson.
[02:21:58.920 --> 02:22:00.720]   He looks like the front end of a truck.
[02:22:00.720 --> 02:22:01.720]   Come on, Carson.
[02:22:01.720 --> 02:22:02.720]   That is so dystopian.
[02:22:02.720 --> 02:22:03.720]   You know what?
[02:22:03.720 --> 02:22:06.720]   I think that's a cool compliment.
[02:22:06.720 --> 02:22:10.160]   You look like the front end of a truck.
[02:22:10.160 --> 02:22:11.160]   A neck truck?
[02:22:11.160 --> 02:22:12.160]   Sure.
[02:22:12.160 --> 02:22:13.160]   I like it.
[02:22:13.160 --> 02:22:14.160]   It's new...
[02:22:14.160 --> 02:22:16.000]   It's new meaning to what, you know, up in your grill.
[02:22:16.000 --> 02:22:17.000]   Yeah.
[02:22:17.000 --> 02:22:18.280]   You look like a bulldog in the hood.
[02:22:18.280 --> 02:22:21.040]   And then Carson's son, we were talking about Zack.
[02:22:21.040 --> 02:22:25.480]   This is his college fund.
[02:22:25.480 --> 02:22:27.400]   So it's an interesting story.
[02:22:27.400 --> 02:22:30.720]   You may remember those of you watching Twitter on Sunday.
[02:22:30.720 --> 02:22:36.520]   Brianna Wu was on and said, "Tomorrow morning, get up early, 8 a.m. because analog is going
[02:22:36.520 --> 02:22:39.200]   to sell the analog pocket."
[02:22:39.200 --> 02:22:43.440]   Which is a really interesting game boy.
[02:22:43.440 --> 02:22:46.040]   I want to say emulator, but it's not.
[02:22:46.040 --> 02:22:47.040]   It's not an emulator.
[02:22:47.040 --> 02:22:51.840]   It's a FPGA's to run Game Boy games.
[02:22:51.840 --> 02:22:53.920]   It is an emulator that sends it's not from...
[02:22:53.920 --> 02:22:54.920]   Excuse me, Nintendo.
[02:22:54.920 --> 02:22:57.280]   8 minutes, they sold out.
[02:22:57.280 --> 02:23:01.160]   I got on there half an hour late, gone.
[02:23:01.160 --> 02:23:03.520]   But you know who did not get on there late?
[02:23:03.520 --> 02:23:04.600]   Carson.
[02:23:04.600 --> 02:23:05.600]   And he bought one for Zack.
[02:23:05.600 --> 02:23:09.960]   And then he said, "Zack, you got two options here.
[02:23:09.960 --> 02:23:17.000]   You could play it or you could sell it on eBay and add a little to your college fund."
[02:23:17.000 --> 02:23:20.000]   Zack, not being a fool.
[02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:22.560]   And being a capitalist.
[02:23:22.560 --> 02:23:25.880]   And being a good capitalist has listed it on eBay.
[02:23:25.880 --> 02:23:28.040]   The starting bid is $1,200.
[02:23:28.040 --> 02:23:29.040]   Get him, Zack.
[02:23:29.040 --> 02:23:30.040]   Get him, Zack.
[02:23:30.040 --> 02:23:34.840]   Well, but it includes the doc and the case.
[02:23:34.840 --> 02:23:36.320]   And they already sold it.
[02:23:36.320 --> 02:23:37.320]   Did he?
[02:23:37.320 --> 02:23:38.320]   Oh, it ended.
[02:23:38.320 --> 02:23:39.320]   Carson.
[02:23:39.320 --> 02:23:40.320]   Oh, there's an error in the listing.
[02:23:40.320 --> 02:23:41.320]   All right.
[02:23:41.320 --> 02:23:44.400]   So we got to get a new listing up here from Frowsy.
[02:23:44.400 --> 02:23:50.080]   But when that new listing goes up from Frowsy, Frowsy, here's the new listing.
[02:23:50.080 --> 02:23:51.080]   All right.
[02:23:51.080 --> 02:23:53.480]   Carson's put it in the chat room.
[02:23:53.480 --> 02:23:58.920]   He says, "No, that's something else."
[02:23:58.920 --> 02:24:01.240]   Carson, focus.
[02:24:01.240 --> 02:24:05.040]   We want to get Zack's college fund.
[02:24:05.040 --> 02:24:09.480]   The device doesn't come out until May of next year.
[02:24:09.480 --> 02:24:14.560]   So you're going to be buying that on spec as they say.
[02:24:14.560 --> 02:24:15.560]   But you know what?
[02:24:15.560 --> 02:24:18.520]   Maybe Carson, as we get a little closer to May, maybe we could push that a little bit
[02:24:18.520 --> 02:24:19.520]   harder.
[02:24:19.520 --> 02:24:20.520]   Yeah.
[02:24:20.520 --> 02:24:21.520]   You know what?
[02:24:21.520 --> 02:24:23.240]   If he doesn't sell it, I'm buying it.
[02:24:23.240 --> 02:24:25.440]   Yeah, you have to relist it.
[02:24:25.440 --> 02:24:26.600]   Yeah, that's why.
[02:24:26.600 --> 02:24:27.600]   Yeah.
[02:24:27.600 --> 02:24:28.600]   Something went wrong.
[02:24:28.600 --> 02:24:34.640]   Ladies and gentlemen, we had about 100 more stories to do, but it is after all time
[02:24:34.640 --> 02:24:37.920]   to go out and have a saccotini.
[02:24:37.920 --> 02:24:38.920]   J.C. Higginbotham is...
[02:24:38.920 --> 02:24:41.160]   Wait, how bad was the saccotini?
[02:24:41.160 --> 02:24:42.160]   I have to know.
[02:24:42.160 --> 02:24:43.160]   It was actually delicious.
[02:24:43.160 --> 02:24:44.160]   Okay.
[02:24:44.160 --> 02:24:45.160]   That was...
[02:24:45.160 --> 02:24:46.160]   Paul...
[02:24:46.160 --> 02:24:47.160]   That was not an option.
[02:24:47.160 --> 02:24:48.160]   I was prepared for it.
[02:24:48.160 --> 02:24:55.440]   Paul Therat's wife's invention, a cocktail involving one would think pretty awful ingredients.
[02:24:55.440 --> 02:25:05.520]   Sake mixed with cucumber lime vodka and quantro, shaken and poured into a martini glass.
[02:25:05.520 --> 02:25:09.480]   And it was actually... it's very refreshing.
[02:25:09.480 --> 02:25:11.080]   And I went to bed early.
[02:25:11.080 --> 02:25:14.920]   And that's the whole story and that's all I'm going to say about that.
[02:25:14.920 --> 02:25:16.840]   No, it's actually really good.
[02:25:16.840 --> 02:25:17.840]   The saccotini.
[02:25:17.840 --> 02:25:19.840]   Sake is at stacyoniot.com.
[02:25:19.840 --> 02:25:22.640]   There's a newsletter there.
[02:25:22.640 --> 02:25:24.240]   You can subscribe to it absolutely free.
[02:25:24.240 --> 02:25:26.360]   Well worth it if you want to keep up on IoT.
[02:25:26.360 --> 02:25:31.240]   She also hosts a fantastic podcast with Kevin Tofel, the IoT podcast.
[02:25:31.240 --> 02:25:34.200]   It is a great way to keep up on IoT.
[02:25:34.200 --> 02:25:36.680]   And look for future events coming soon.
[02:25:36.680 --> 02:25:39.680]   Her previous event is available there right now.
[02:25:39.680 --> 02:25:41.000]   Staceyoniot.com/edge.
[02:25:41.000 --> 02:25:45.360]   There's also Staceyoniot.com/connect, right?
[02:25:45.360 --> 02:25:46.360]   Connected?
[02:25:46.360 --> 02:25:47.360]   Connected.
[02:25:47.360 --> 02:25:48.360]   Okay.
[02:25:48.360 --> 02:25:51.960]   And eventually the events tab on my site will lead to our events, not just random IoT events
[02:25:51.960 --> 02:25:54.880]   since there are fewer random IoT events happening.
[02:25:54.880 --> 02:25:57.000]   There certainly are.
[02:25:57.000 --> 02:25:59.880]   Carsten's order is now back up.
[02:25:59.880 --> 02:26:01.880]   Here's the new listing.
[02:26:01.880 --> 02:26:04.160]   Oh, much prettier.
[02:26:04.160 --> 02:26:05.160]   Look at that.
[02:26:05.160 --> 02:26:06.160]   Much prettier.
[02:26:06.160 --> 02:26:09.280]   That's the complete set.
[02:26:09.280 --> 02:26:10.720]   You get everything.
[02:26:10.720 --> 02:26:13.240]   So that's a good deal.
[02:26:13.240 --> 02:26:20.320]   Brand new, unused, unopened, undamaged original packaging in black.
[02:26:20.320 --> 02:26:24.400]   That's a good 17th birthday present, Carsten.
[02:26:24.400 --> 02:26:25.840]   It's a little bit of a markup.
[02:26:25.840 --> 02:26:33.680]   I will check in again in six days and 24 hours to see if I can snipe it.
[02:26:33.680 --> 02:26:35.400]   Rousy Frousy on eBay.
[02:26:35.400 --> 02:26:37.120]   Look for the analog pocket.
[02:26:37.120 --> 02:26:41.280]   Blackamp Pruitt is the host of Hands on Photography, Hands on Wellness.
[02:26:41.280 --> 02:26:43.080]   He comes here every Wednesday.
[02:26:43.080 --> 02:26:44.080]   He is the best.
[02:26:44.080 --> 02:26:50.560]   Watch him cook on Friday, 4 p.m. Pacific, 7 p.m. Eastern for our kitchen and pleasant
[02:26:50.560 --> 02:26:51.560]   kitchen in place.
[02:26:51.560 --> 02:26:52.560]   Shelter in kitchen.
[02:26:52.560 --> 02:26:53.560]   Shelter in kitchen.
[02:26:53.560 --> 02:26:54.560]   Shelter in kitchen.
[02:26:54.560 --> 02:26:55.840]   Thank you for being here.
[02:26:55.840 --> 02:26:56.840]   We appreciate it.
[02:26:56.840 --> 02:26:57.840]   Thanks for having me.
[02:26:57.840 --> 02:27:02.440]   And of course, the king of the hour, Jeff Jarvis.
[02:27:02.440 --> 02:27:07.680]   He is a director of the townite center for entrepreneurial journalism at the Craig Newmark
[02:27:07.680 --> 02:27:11.560]   Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York.
[02:27:11.560 --> 02:27:19.720]   Angry about many things, his COVID Twitter list is a must follow bitly/COVID Twitter list.
[02:27:19.720 --> 02:27:24.120]   Now with, how many do I have down?
[02:27:24.120 --> 02:27:29.400]   Quick check, COVID 13.3,000 followers.
[02:27:29.400 --> 02:27:30.400]   Wow.
[02:27:30.400 --> 02:27:34.560]   As you might see, a column on my Tweet deck.
[02:27:34.560 --> 02:27:38.760]   So it's whenever I open Tweet deck, and that's really the only way I read Twitter now, is
[02:27:38.760 --> 02:27:40.480]   I have that in that middle column there.
[02:27:40.480 --> 02:27:42.440]   That's all of your stuff.
[02:27:42.440 --> 02:27:43.440]   Very nice to have that.
[02:27:43.440 --> 02:27:46.000]   It's a really good idea.
