[00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.400]   Facebook, Twitter, really whatever's on our minds because we've got the best panel
[00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.680]   ever as always.
[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.120]   Gina Tarpani is here from think up dot com.
[00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.040]   We're going to talk about that brand new business coming down the line.
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.640]   Founding editor of Life Hacker Hygiena, mother to Etta.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.840]   Also here, Mr. Jeff Jarvis of the City University of New York.
[00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.240]   He's a professor of journalism at CUNY.

[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.800]   Gina's is smarter where smarter word out of work.
[00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.200]   Although I bet you we don't see a lot of postings lately because she's been kind
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.000]   of busy on something else.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.360]   We're going to talk about that in a minute.
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.880]   Little bit busy.
[00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.480]   Also, we're really glad to have Aaron Nukem here.
[00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.960]   He's a regular on many of our shows, including Floss Weekly and all about Andrew.
[00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:58.480]   You're here last night and we said, yeah, you want to come in for a tweak?
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.120]   I did all about Android last night, Floss Weekly this morning and then
[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.040]   this week in Google.
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.920]   Busy guy.
[00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:04.360]   Yeah.
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.120]   Aaron, is that a new you've got new jobs last we talked.
[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.360]   New job at NetApp.
[00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.120]   Yep, that's right.
[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.040]   Doing solutions, marketing for them,
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.040]   storage products.
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.680]   So it's a lot of fun.
[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.800]   Good to have you.
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.080]   Glad to be here.
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.640]   I don't know where to start.
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:19.720]   We know where to start.
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.720]   We've been speaking for Google.
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.400]   Is that where we should start?
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.200]   I think we should start with think up.
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.160]   Oh, we should start with think up and then we'll talk about Google's new privacy
[00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.680]   policy.
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:30.760]   You're absolutely right.
[00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.720]   So think up dot com.
[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.320]   Now, this is not a new product because we've been talking about think up for some
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:37.680]   time.
[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.600]   It was the thing I have been waiting for.
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.160]   The dummy in the show has been waiting for the hosted version of think up.
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.680]   Is that right?
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.160]   Yes.
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.560]   Yes.
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:45.440]   This is the easy sign up.
[00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.040]   So think up an open source app I've been working on for four years.
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.440]   I've talked about it here on the show quite a bit.
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.680]   But it's an app that you install on your web server and not everybody has a web
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:54.000]   server.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   So think up dot com is basically going to be the WordPress.com to the open source app.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.240]   It's going to be the hosted sign up sign up centralized service.
[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:06.920]   And I'll vouch for it because I've been I've been using think up for over a year.
[00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.960]   And it's amazing the analytics you get now.
[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.400]   I've just been using it for Twitter, but this won't be just Twitter, right?
[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.280]   No, it won't.
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.920]   It's going to be right now the open source app.
[00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.560]   Supports Twitter, Facebook, Google plus four square.
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.800]   We just had Instagram pull requests come in and we get analytics from Bitly and we
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.480]   get location data from Google Maps.
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.000]   And it's a totally pluggable architecture.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.280]   So yeah, we basically hook it up to new services every few months.
[00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.920]   We just did Google Summer of Code, actually, which is a open source mentorship
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.080]   program that Google runs.
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.520]   And in fact, I'm going to be up at the Google plaques this weekend.
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:42.760]   There's a mentor summit for all the mentors in summer code.
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:43.160]   Yeah.
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.560]   And one of my students who I mentored this summer built the Instagram plugin.
[00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.520]   So I'm really I'm really excited about that.
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:50.880]   So you're doing a kind of a kick
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.040]   startery thing if you go to think up.com.
[00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:59.200]   You can join now and in fact, kind of pledging that you will be a member at $60
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.720]   a year, five bucks a month for the basic plan.
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.720]   That means one name for all the services just mentioned.
[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.800]   Yeah, there's a pro plan that lets you do
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.160]   ten names for every service.
[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.720]   Up to 10 accounts plus API access and and you know, kind of access to our beta
[00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:17.920]   builds.
[00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:21.200]   So that's the pro membership for folks who are kind of power users.
[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:25.600]   Probably should do the executive since we are an organization and want to stake
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.640]   in your future.
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:29.480]   So what do you get?
[00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.200]   You get the book, which is kind of cool insights.
[00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.120]   And then you get the service.
[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.560]   Yep.
[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.760]   Yep.
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.680]   So we've got an incredible collection of interviews from some of the like some
[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.160]   of the most really interesting people.
[00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.160]   We haven't announced who's in the book yet, but trust me,
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.040]   it's going to be really good.
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.520]   We're doing a series interviews about how some of the most creative and
[00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.320]   smartest people online use social media.
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:49.360]   That'll be the book.
[00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.200]   So you get the ebook.
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.280]   That's a special just for the crowdfunding campaign.
[00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:56.080]   But when you back the crowdfunding campaign at think up.com, you basically
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.920]   you're subscribing to the service.
[00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:01.440]   You're you're you're you're buying an annual membership, essentially.
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.880]   You don't get charged until we actually launch, which is going to be January 15th.
[00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:08.200]   So you're just saying, hey, I want to prejoin.
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:12.600]   And that's kind of a way for us to turn our users into our investors.
[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.280]   We just want to be we want to build this product and be as accountable to our
[00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.160]   users as we are to our investors.
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.440]   Are you are you going to launch no matter what or is this kind of contingent
[00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:22.800]   on raising enough money?
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.160]   We're going to launch no matter what.
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:24.800]   OK.
[00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:25.320]   Yeah.
[00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.000]   Yeah, which is exciting.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:28.800]   Yes, we do.
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:34.560]   We actually we we closed the I would call it a modest round and modest non
[00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:39.160]   crunch or the round of funding from some really great investors.
[00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.440]   And we haven't announced the details of that yet, but our goal is a company is
[00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:44.560]   to be as sort of open and transparent as possible.
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.920]   So we're in the process of getting the final OK from all the lawyers.
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:52.120]   We are actually going to publish the the details of our round of funding
[00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:56.560]   because we kind of want to help make that whole process which has taken a really
[00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:01.360]   long time for us and has been a huge educational thing for me more transparent
[00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:06.240]   and make it give give some insight to other young companies who want to start
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:12.040]   doing the car coming back from Leo's when we were there for I oh just numbers.
[00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:16.280]   How many times did you have to make the presentation to get the round on?
[00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.800]   Oh, man.
[00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:25.200]   I mean, luckily, Neil, my co-founder is amazing and tireless and is like the best
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.960]   I've ever seen like anybody do anything with a pitch deck.
[00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:31.280]   I mean, he really took the burden of that off of me and he really did the pitches.
[00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:33.080]   He went to the meetings. He did a lot of the pitches.
[00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:36.640]   I was writing a lot of the code, but yeah, it was a slog.
[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:37.960]   It was a slog. Yeah.
[00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:42.120]   So we should say it's a Neil Dash who many of us remember from six apart.
[00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:46.600]   It was there for a long time and he's been your partner on think up for a while.
[00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:49.720]   There he is. Quite some time and a great guy.
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:53.280]   Just one of the just I love a Neil and he's he's amazing.
[00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:55.320]   Yeah. So this is a good team.
[00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:56.280]   Is that you in the back?
[00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:58.160]   I was just going to ask.
[00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:59.360]   No, that wasn't me.
[00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:00.240]   There she is.
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:01.880]   Yeah, there I am.
[00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:04.720]   I'm in the video at some point at some point.
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:08.400]   Well, I've signed up and I've shared it on Twitter and Google Plus and I invite
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:10.200]   everybody to do the same.
[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:14.600]   It's easy to do think up dot com and trust me, I think, you know, if you if you
[00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:18.280]   have questions, browse around when you see the kind of valuable stuff that you
[00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:23.040]   learn, I've I've visited think up a lot just because I love the insights and this
[00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:23.920]   has just been on Twitter.
[00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:26.160]   I can't wait to add all my other social networks to this.
[00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:29.160]   Thank you so much. And you know, we were really we were really inspired.
[00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.280]   I was really inspired by a lot of things that we've talked about, particularly
[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:36.200]   Jeff, your principles on the internet or or or, you know, acting on principle and
[00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:37.840]   and a Neil also pushed this.
[00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:41.440]   You know, we published our our kind of values as a company and like part of our
[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:45.480]   goal with this campaign is not only to launch a product that hopefully
[00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:49.080]   customers think is valuable enough to pay for, but also to build a company that's
[00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:53.600]   extremely, you know, that's that's accountable to its users first and that is
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:58.000]   open as open source as the source code is for the app and is transparent and forth.
[00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:01.720]   So, yeah, thank you.
[00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:04.440]   You know, it's hard, you know, when you when you publish a company's values,
[00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:08.520]   it's like, you know, it's like a kind of company have values is like, no, of course,
[00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:10.280]   people have values, right?
[00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:13.680]   And it always I was tweeting it a day like is this, you know, does this trip your
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:17.760]   BS detector when you hear a company has values, but it's about sort of creating
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:21.320]   the ground rules, you know, like this is what we are setting out to do and you
[00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:23.680]   should call us out on it if we're not doing the right thing.
[00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:28.000]   And so anyway, I want to thank you, Jeff, for for kind of hammering home
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.520]   the importance of having a company.
[00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:31.480]   That's awesome.
[00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:32.400]   Welcome to that.
[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:33.280]   Don't be evil, Jada.
[00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:34.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   And you can still if you run a server and you know a little bit about a
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.200]   configuring for PHP and so forth, you could still install think up on your own
[00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:42.000]   servers, right?
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.200]   Absolutely.
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:44.200]   The app is not changing.
[00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:45.200]   The app is open source.
[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:46.120]   It will remain open source.
[00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:49.920]   And in fact, the company, the purpose of the company is to fund development of the
[00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:50.600]   open source out.
[00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:51.400]   That's not going away.
[00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:53.400]   You will always be able to install it on your own server for free.
[00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:57.040]   You'll always be able to hack it and modify it and fork it and send pull request
[00:08:57.240 --> 00:08:57.640]   to us.
[00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:58.320]   That doesn't change.
[00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:01.720]   And in fact, it would violate the license if we didn't if we did change that.
[00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:06.120]   So this isn't to to end the open source development or to make think of not free.
[00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:09.880]   It's actually the opposite where we want to spend our time instead of doing
[00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:13.920]   stupid pitches in VC conference rooms, we want to spend time actually building a
[00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:14.480]   product.
[00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:18.000]   So that's partially why we're doing that crowd funding campaign.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.160]   They really are the WordPress model of the time.
[00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:26.480]   And I talked to Polaris WordPress's VCs way back in the time with Matt Mullenweg
[00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:31.720]   and they got convinced to leave WordPress.org as the open source and that it's
[00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:35.640]   really a sensible model because everybody who uses WordPress has to add to the
[00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:40.160]   co-base everybody who writes extensions for it adds to it WordPress.com is the
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:45.280]   smartest company on top of it, the first in, but they benefit from all that free
[00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:46.920]   work that's going into WordPress.org.
[00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:48.400]   It's it's it's smart.
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:49.680]   It's a win win.
[00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:50.360]   It's a win win.
[00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:53.320]   And we're going to get Jean on floss weekly to talk just about exactly what she
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:53.760]   just said.
[00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.640]   So we're going to we're going to absolutely do that.
[00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:58.320]   That's one of the neat things about open source is the different models people
[00:09:58.320 --> 00:09:59.480]   choose the different ways.
[00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:05.120]   It's a great way to experiment with new ways of thinking about business.
[00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:06.520]   And I just this is great.
[00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:09.840]   Well, it's also about trying to think it struck me from all this NSA stuff and
[00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:11.360]   listening to Steve on security.
[00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:17.360]   So depressing is I know, but but the notion that open source is the path to trust.
[00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:18.000]   Yes.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:23.880]   And to do what you're writing and not just as code, but as a company and as hardware
[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:27.680]   was we as we head into that, it's it's all the more necessary and all the more
[00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:28.320]   laudable.
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:29.840]   Good.
[00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:33.960]   Do you want to just not show describe the analytics that you get from think up?
[00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:34.760]   Absolutely.
[00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:36.920]   So so think up is a is a really simple app.
[00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:38.800]   It's a stream of insights, right?
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:42.120]   So the first iteration version one was kind of like Google Analytics.
[00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:45.240]   You know, you kind of went to this dashboard and you just get a bunch of charts
[00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:48.800]   and we think that that's valuable, but we think that the app should do more, right?
[00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:50.600]   It should tell you what do the charts mean.
[00:10:50.800 --> 00:10:55.440]   So what the app is is a very simple reverse chronological stream of insights
[00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:57.600]   on things that are happening in those charts.
[00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:01.920]   So things like, you know, what was the tweet that made my followers the happiest
[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:07.040]   last week to people like my old profile picture better than my new one?
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:11.000]   Did anyone who is well known or have a lot of followers retweet something of mine
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.440]   and we send an alert, you know, if you do, do any of my new friends or followers
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:19.440]   work at Google or work at Facebook, that kind of thing.
[00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:20.680]   It just it just pings you.
[00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:25.320]   It's just a little it's kind of like a newsfeed, but it's it's of insights about
[00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:27.400]   your activity, about what's going on with your activity.
[00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:29.880]   And it provides you with all your tweets.
[00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:32.160]   There's no limit to the number of tweets you can archive.
[00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:35.840]   It archives all your tweets and Steve Martin used it to create his book of
[00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:37.920]   Twitter aphorisms.
[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:39.960]   He's very funny on the comedians.
[00:11:39.960 --> 00:11:40.760]   Very funny.
[00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:45.240]   And so Gina hooked him up and got him set up on think up so that he could have
[00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:46.560]   all his tweets.
[00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:48.440]   I hope that was in the deck.
[00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:50.080]   Yeah, it was.
[00:11:50.080 --> 00:11:53.840]   It was, you know, there's a thing like I love what Google does with data liberation.
[00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:57.760]   I get it, but to me, an export link is just not enough.
[00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:58.240]   Right.
[00:11:58.240 --> 00:11:59.720]   So I can export my tweets now.
[00:11:59.720 --> 00:11:59.960]   Right.
[00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:02.680]   So if I went to Twitter right now and I clicked on export my tweets, great.
[00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:03.800]   I get a zip file on my tweets.
[00:12:03.800 --> 00:12:04.720]   It's not enough.
[00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:08.720]   The minute that I tweet something new that that that file is out of date.
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:11.040]   And it's just a dead zip file on my hard drive.
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:12.040]   It's not enough.
[00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:12.480]   Right.
[00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:14.640]   I should be getting all of my data.
[00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:17.080]   And when I say all of my data, I mean the replies from my friends.
[00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:17.960]   I mean the favorites.
[00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:18.920]   I mean the links.
[00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:20.320]   I mean the expanded links.
[00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:21.600]   I mean the number of clicks per link.
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:21.960]   Right.
[00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:25.040]   And this is all stuff that Twitter has and knows about me and Facebook has
[00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:25.720]   and knows about me.
[00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:28.360]   And they use that data to advertise to me more effectively.
[00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:29.760]   And I have no problem with that.
[00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:33.720]   But I also can learn a lot more about myself and how I can get better.
[00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:37.840]   Imagine it is for a quantified self for my social persona.
[00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:39.760]   And I should be able to get that.
[00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:42.680]   So while I love data liberation, I'm really glad that these networks are
[00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:46.360]   giving us the opportunity natively to export our own data because that, again,
[00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:47.280]   we're zero, right?
[00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:49.440]   Like that's we should be able to get them when we put out.
[00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:50.680]   I just don't think it's enough.
[00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:55.600]   So that's why I built think up because it's constantly thinking your data,
[00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:59.280]   learning about what you're doing and then telling you what you should know
[00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:05.440]   about what you're doing versus just locking up those kind of insights inside
[00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:08.200]   the company's ad systems, ad targeting systems.
[00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:13.040]   It's when I when I export my data from Twitter, though, all get is the tweet
[00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:16.720]   I've done, not all the rest of that wonderful stuff, right?
[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:17.160]   Right.
[00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:18.520]   Does Twitter have to cooperate?
[00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:19.160]   You have Twitter.
[00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:21.720]   You think up that it isn't think up.
[00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:22.120]   Yeah.
[00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:23.160]   Yeah.
[00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:24.600]   Add that and think up.
[00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:27.360]   We yeah, we are going to add an import your archive
[00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:28.200]   feature.
[00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:28.600]   Mm-hmm.
[00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:29.080]   Yep.
[00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:32.840]   So if you join think up now, you can go back and add history.
[00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:33.400]   Yeah.
[00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:37.520]   From the API programmatically in the API, you can go back to 3200 tweets.
[00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:40.000]   I think Twitter hasn't particular the Twitter.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.400]   They haven't increased that.
[00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:43.800]   If you have an archive, we are going to have a feature that will let you just import
[00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:44.320]   your archive.
[00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:44.560]   That's good.
[00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:46.840]   Export from Twitter, import your archive.
[00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:49.800]   And then that gives you kind of all the flashback kind of stuff.
[00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:52.160]   Like, hey, what was I talking about three years ago?
[00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:55.840]   What was, you know, what was, you know, what's the last time I did, you know,
[00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:58.360]   who's someone that we haven't talked to, talked to in over a year,
[00:13:58.360 --> 00:14:02.040]   who I'm friends with, that kind of things, we do kind of a lot of look back stuff.
[00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:05.560]   It would make sense for Twitter to support this because it makes people use
[00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:07.520]   Twitter more, I would think.
[00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:08.120]   Yeah.
[00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:09.520]   I mean, the goal, think up's goal.
[00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:12.080]   You know, this is kind of squishy and people were like, what does this mean?
[00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:15.280]   But, you know, our headline on the crowdfunding campaign is like, feel good
[00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:16.440]   about social networking, right?
[00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:19.920]   Like, this is supposed to help people get more insight into what's going on
[00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:22.680]   on their network and appreciate what's going on in the network and make them
[00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:26.040]   tweet more and make them like more and make them participate more because,
[00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:29.240]   fundamentally, we think that more participation is a good thing.
[00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:30.280]   Right.
[00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:30.760]   Right.
[00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:34.400]   But we want to, we want to make
[00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:39.680]   users participation more mindful, more thoughtful, more informed.
[00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:41.200]   And more effective.
[00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:43.480]   So now we have to push this show.
[00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:48.160]   We have to push Google plus to enable export, right?
[00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:49.160]   Yeah.
[00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:51.320]   I mean, Google plus definitely has a lot of data locked up into it.
[00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:54.320]   And it does have an API and we do have Google plus support.
[00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:55.640]   The API could be better.
[00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:59.120]   It's read only that's what that's OK for us because think up is read only.
[00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:01.000]   It doesn't post for you.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:04.080]   But yeah, I mean, plus ones and replies.
[00:15:04.080 --> 00:15:08.560]   I mean, there's lots of lots of possibilities for for finding out, you know,
[00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:11.520]   making new connections and finding better content and figuring out what's
[00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:14.320]   what was important to you in the past and what is now what's important to your
[00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:15.200]   friends through that data.
[00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:16.800]   And yeah, they could do a better job with their API.
[00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:18.480]   I'd like to see more improvements there.
[00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:18.920]   API.
[00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:23.240]   What's the service that's not cooperating that you would most want
[00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:26.040]   to have an API?
[00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:27.200]   Oh, that's a good thing.
[00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:28.520]   Yeah, you know, that's a really good question.
[00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:32.680]   I mean, happily we're in a place in 2013 where the most popular services,
[00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:36.480]   which I would argue are Twitter, Facebook, Instagram.
[00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:39.440]   And, you know, to some degree, four square
[00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:42.560]   and path, like have pretty, pretty good APIs.
[00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:45.200]   There aren't that many services that don't have an API at all.
[00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:48.560]   There's always like things that I wish certain APIs did, right?
[00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:52.240]   Like like Twitter's API, Twitter is always kind of focused on like follow or
[00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:54.800]   count, for example, that's something it's very easy to find out how many people
[00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:56.240]   follow someone on Twitter, right?
[00:15:56.240 --> 00:15:59.760]   But you can't you can't very easily find out how many people are subscribed to
[00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:01.240]   someone, for example, on Facebook.
[00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:05.320]   You can get their subscribers and page through a hundred times, but they don't
[00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:08.520]   have to offer like a total, you know, so I have little nitpicks about, you know,
[00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:13.160]   I wish there were particular methods that were available, say, on Facebook as
[00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:17.280]   anywhere else, but there's no one company that I'm like these, you know, this is,
[00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:20.080]   you know, the API is completely terrible.
[00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:23.400]   They all sort of offer their own take on what they think is important.
[00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:26.280]   It's really interesting to see what those companies value, you know, through
[00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:30.000]   their API, you know, they offer API methods for data that they think is is
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:33.400]   valuable. So on Twitter followers is really, you know, is a valuable and
[00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:37.200]   important thing, your home timeline is a big thing for Twitter.
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:39.960]   But it's not as much on on Facebook.
[00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:42.480]   Does Reddit have one?
[00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:44.160]   Oh, that's a really good question.
[00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:47.040]   I actually haven't looked into the into the API.
[00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:48.360]   It should. Yeah, it's open source.
[00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:49.680]   I can't imagine that it doesn't. Oh, yeah.
[00:16:49.680 --> 00:16:50.320]   Yeah, they do.
[00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:52.720]   And I'm sure it has a I'm sure it has a wonderful idea, actually.
[00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:55.280]   Well, I think having this federated view is awesome.
[00:16:55.280 --> 00:17:00.640]   I mean, this is what's was especially for companies or for people trying to, you
[00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:04.640]   know, that are kind of in the industry, so to speak, as we are, that want to reach
[00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:06.040]   out and see, OK, what's my reach?
[00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:07.560]   Am I doing well on Facebook?
[00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:09.240]   Am I doing well on Twitter?
[00:17:09.240 --> 00:17:12.040]   You know, maybe Google is really taking off all of a sudden.
[00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:15.040]   What did I do differently there that, you know, made that happen?
[00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:17.880]   So I think having these insights, especially for companies or individuals
[00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:21.960]   that are promoting themselves to a certain degree, hopefully not out of, you
[00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:25.240]   know, not out of ego, but like, you know, people like us that are doing shows
[00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:27.920]   and things we want to reach out to as many people as possible.
[00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:30.840]   This is super valuable information, so.
[00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:31.760]   Yeah, thank you.
[00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:33.440]   We're definitely targeting power users.
[00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:34.640]   We're definitely targeting individuals.
[00:17:34.640 --> 00:17:38.080]   I mean, one of the main things that we think is that social media works best for
[00:17:38.080 --> 00:17:38.680]   individuals, right?
[00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:42.360]   Like the Barack Obama account on Twitter has way more followers than the White
[00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:43.040]   House account, right?
[00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:45.640]   Because one is a sort of a faceless organization and one is an individual person.
[00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:48.400]   And so we think that social media works best with individuals, but we're
[00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:52.080]   definitely targeting people like the host on this network or people who have a
[00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:56.120]   YouTube channel or an Etsy store or Kickstarter, people who are, you know,
[00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:59.720]   purposely trying to gain audience, trying to have conversations, not people who are
[00:17:59.720 --> 00:18:03.720]   going to, you know, buy 10,000 followers for a hundred bucks and then submit a
[00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:07.960]   report to the chief marketing officer and try to prove that, you know, the brand is
[00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:08.800]   doing better, right?
[00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:12.240]   Like this is for people who actually care and who want to be honest and authentic.
[00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:17.200]   I know that that's become kind of a buzzword recently, but individuals who really
[00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:20.480]   do want to get better at participating in these networks because they're powerful
[00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:21.160]   things.
[00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:23.880]   So how well does it scale right now?
[00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:27.920]   I mean, I mean, what if I was a company and I wanted to roll something like this out
[00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:32.960]   or use this to because I've got, you know, just for my, like, main brand presences
[00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:36.160]   on Google+, and Facebook and whatever else.
[00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:40.520]   I mean, would it scale well enough for a company that's doing lots of things?
[00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:44.560]   Yeah, I mean, look, it's a it's a PHP MySQL application.
[00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:46.720]   If you're a company, we ran it for the White House.
[00:18:46.720 --> 00:18:52.240]   They have tons of followers and get just gigabytes and gigabytes of responses
[00:18:52.440 --> 00:18:54.040]   and engagement from their followers.
[00:18:54.040 --> 00:19:00.600]   We did a lot of work on optimizing and making sure that we had kind of, you know,
[00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:05.160]   that the app scales for people at that, you know, at that rare air.
[00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:07.640]   That is extremely rare for the big.
[00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:10.200]   I mean, we're really kind of targeting people with, you know, individuals who have
[00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:12.760]   bigger audiences than than most of the population.
[00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:17.800]   I mean, we are targeting for power users, but for, you know, really it kind of depends
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:22.960]   on the on how how popular the brand is or or how many followers they have.
[00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:26.920]   But it pretty much works for, you know, 95 percent.
[00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:29.600]   We do run into those few users who say, hey, my crawl time's out.
[00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:33.720]   And it's like you've just got so many data that it's just looping through pages
[00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:38.440]   and pages and pages, but we built in a lot of stop gaps for that kind of situation.
[00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:41.120]   Well, I'll imagine if it works for the White House.
[00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:45.040]   That's going to cover, you know, it's a pretty good set of populations.
[00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:46.000]   Yeah, it's pretty good.
[00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:49.680]   Yeah, we've had some really big users with over a million.
[00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:55.880]   We've had million plus follower users and they crashed and we fixed it.
[00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:56.400]   There you go.
[00:19:56.400 --> 00:20:00.280]   We have four years of development and experience running the open source app
[00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:02.480]   behind us. So I'm really excited.
[00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:05.640]   The rollout in January is going to be really super solid and stable because we
[00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:07.360]   have been building this thing for so much time.
[00:20:07.360 --> 00:20:09.000]   This isn't brand new code.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.320]   This is code that's been stressed test and iterated over time.
[00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:13.800]   Excellent.
[00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:14.360]   Great.
[00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:16.600]   Again, think up.com and you can do it.
[00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:18.040]   You can do it yourself.
[00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:20.000]   Sign up today.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.040]   Thank you.
[00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:25.280]   Going to happen no matter what, but sign up today.
[00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:28.200]   It's nice to have a built in customer base, right?
[00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:32.080]   Yeah, I mean, look, frankly, yeah, it's we want to we want to launch for the
[00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:35.280]   customer base. We want to be bringing revenue for one.
[00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:37.640]   I can't imagine you wouldn't.
[00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:38.400]   So good.
[00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:39.240]   Congratulations.
[00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:39.840]   It's really great.
[00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:40.360]   Thank you.
[00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:41.240]   Thank you so much.
[00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:42.840]   Let's talk about Google.
[00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:44.440]   They're trying to make a little money on the side.
[00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:45.240]   I don't blame them.
[00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:48.560]   It's expensive thing running on those servers and so forth.
[00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:53.400]   So they change their privacy policy in advance.
[00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:56.960]   Unlike Facebook, where they just change it and then wait till you find out, they
[00:20:56.960 --> 00:21:02.160]   change it in advance to let you know that at some point in the future, unknown
[00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:08.880]   when they're going to start using what you plus one or I don't know exactly
[00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:13.960]   what the criteria will be to do an endorsement ad to your friends.
[00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:15.400]   Kind of like Facebook, right?
[00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:17.480]   Is this like sponsored posts on Facebook?
[00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:19.320]   Well, it's like beacon was.
[00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:22.920]   Ah, that's where it's it is different than Facebook because it's not just on
[00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:25.480]   Google plus it will go wherever Google ads go.
[00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:26.320]   Right.
[00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:27.640]   Wait a second.
[00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:33.080]   Wasn't beacon if you purchase shoes at Zappos, then it would say, you know, Leo
[00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:33.880]   bought these shoes.
[00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:35.040]   That was a little different, right?
[00:21:35.240 --> 00:21:40.240]   This is only if you plus one something or reviewed something positively
[00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:43.880]   on Google calls them shared endorsements.
[00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:46.960]   So starting it may not be an endorsement.
[00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:49.440]   Yeah, it's just a plus one.
[00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:50.200]   Yeah.
[00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:55.240]   And and and it is a use of your likeness in advertising and there's all kinds of
[00:21:55.240 --> 00:22:00.360]   laws around that ever since the days of the 1890s and people in photography, there
[00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:04.280]   was a young woman whose face was used on the side of a flower barrel against her
[00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:11.520]   dish, the case, but it's a major case that use of likeness in advertising.
[00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:15.880]   Here's what Google says to ensure that your this will go into effect November
[00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:18.680]   11th to and but you can opt out now.
[00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:21.640]   By the way, you're opted in by default.
[00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:25.640]   So you need to actually opt out if you want to get out of this to ensure that your
[00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:30.160]   recommend I love the language to ensure that your recommendations reach the people
[00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:36.120]   care about Google sometimes displays your reviews, recommendations and other relevant
[00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:42.480]   activity throughout its products and services sometimes includes shopping contexts.
[00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:43.800]   So it is kind of like Zappos.
[00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:49.000]   If you buy a song at the Google Play music store that counts and adds your
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.520]   profile name and photo may appear with a recommendation.
[00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:56.080]   If you search for Italian restaurants, for example, you might see an ad for nearby
[00:22:56.280 --> 00:23:00.240]   restaurant along with Aaron Nukem really liked
[00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:06.400]   Giuseppe's or in Google Play searching alone.
[00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:09.320]   Or bless you.
[00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:10.800]   I didn't get the microphone down.
[00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:11.640]   Sorry, apologies for that.
[00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:14.120]   We call these shared endorsements.
[00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:16.960]   Oh, alone, you know, isn't so bothersome is
[00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:19.440]   and saying, hey, your friends like this restaurant, that's four squared.
[00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:21.000]   I'm for that.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.280]   It's the use of it in the ad without your explicit.
[00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:28.520]   OK, here's three examples on on Google's page.
[00:23:28.520 --> 00:23:31.520]   There's one where you see a street view of a
[00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:35.640]   restaurant and then Marsha Garcia says five stars more than just bagels.
[00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:37.240]   That's kind of a search.
[00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:46.080]   But then here is an ad in an AdSense ad for summertime spas in which Katya
[00:23:46.080 --> 00:23:48.320]   Klenova says super relaxing.
[00:23:48.320 --> 00:23:53.920]   Can't wait five stars or an ad for Google Nexus 7 16 gigabit bytes.
[00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:55.840]   Roger Willis says great value.
[00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:57.120]   I mean, I don't know.
[00:23:57.120 --> 00:24:01.080]   I mean, it's pretty clear that this was not done.
[00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:06.040]   This is not like and then it's like referring back to something somebody said
[00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:07.600]   publicly on Google.
[00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:08.520]   Well, that's the thing.
[00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:09.880]   I don't have a problem with that.
[00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:12.160]   If you've already posted a review or
[00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:15.120]   endorsed something with an explicit plus one that I'm fine with that.
[00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:16.680]   It's the shopping thing that bothers me.
[00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:19.640]   So I went to Google Play and I purchased an X is seven.
[00:24:19.640 --> 00:24:21.960]   Does that mean that I endorsed the next seven?
[00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:23.840]   No, it means I bought the next seven.
[00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:24.720]   Maybe I hate it.
[00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:25.120]   Right.
[00:24:25.120 --> 00:24:26.920]   You know, like maybe once I got it, I hate it.
[00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:29.920]   And is it going to say after your wife and you did it?
[00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:30.320]   Right.
[00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:32.520]   Maybe it's a surprise for your wife.
[00:24:32.520 --> 00:24:33.480]   But I don't know.
[00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:37.760]   We don't none of these examples in all three of these examples, these are actual
[00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:38.400]   endorsements.
[00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:41.520]   They gave it a rating and a review.
[00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:42.720]   It's unclear.
[00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:46.240]   Can just buying a product then put you in the ad?
[00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:46.680]   I don't know.
[00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:47.360]   And what would it say?
[00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:47.960]   That's my question.
[00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:49.640]   Gina Trapani bought one.
[00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:50.640]   That's all I was saying.
[00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:51.680]   And that would have it.
[00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:53.720]   That has a no one's business.
[00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:55.400]   Well, it's nobody's business either.
[00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:58.040]   And for someone who does a show called all about Android, right?
[00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:01.080]   If my face is next to the next seven is an endorser, that's kind of a big deal
[00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:01.840]   for you too, Leo.
[00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:02.880]   You buy everything.
[00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:04.160]   Your face would be next to everything.
[00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:06.560]   That doesn't necessarily mean that you endorse it.
[00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:08.520]   You purchase things to review them.
[00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:13.720]   This sometimes includes shopping contexts, but it displays reviews,
[00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:14.400]   recommendations.
[00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:17.800]   The problem is this word, these words, other relevant activity.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:21.520]   What is other relevant activity?
[00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:24.360]   And I don't know if they're explicit about that.
[00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:26.160]   You can turn it off.
[00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:30.160]   Maybe I have a problem with them putting it in an ad.
[00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:34.120]   I'm OK in an editorial context in a search context of saying, here's
[00:25:34.120 --> 00:25:36.600]   five people you know who plus one of this thing.
[00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:37.880]   I think that's public.
[00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:39.120]   And that happens all the time now.
[00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:40.160]   That's already happening.
[00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:41.320]   I'm cool with that.
[00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:45.720]   But then to put it in an ad that they're getting paid for and using my
[00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:48.440]   likeness in advertising.
[00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:50.160]   That's going over the line for me.
[00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:53.440]   And it would and the other thing is that that moderates a little bit.
[00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:57.240]   It would only show up to people you are encircled with even even so.
[00:25:57.240 --> 00:26:00.800]   Some cases even more so because maybe I bought it as a gift or maybe I said this.
[00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:01.640]   I don't know.
[00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:03.800]   It's just
[00:26:03.800 --> 00:26:05.360]   and you're opt me in.
[00:26:05.360 --> 00:26:05.800]   Right.
[00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:07.080]   That's the thing I don't like.
[00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:07.800]   I don't like it.
[00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:08.440]   I don't like it.
[00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:13.440]   You shared activity fund, but to a commercial activity.
[00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:15.000]   I don't know.
[00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:21.880]   I don't like the fact that you have to opt out of this that everyone's in by default.
[00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:24.040]   I mean, I know it doesn't work any other way.
[00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:27.400]   I get the logistics of it because nobody would opt into this thing otherwise.
[00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:29.320]   But exactly.
[00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:30.640]   But doesn't that tell you something?
[00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:34.040]   I mean, doesn't that tell you something that nobody would would volunteer to do this?
[00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:36.800]   I don't get that's the really good point, Aaron.
[00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:41.840]   If you really think like the user, then you've got to think what the user's benefit is.
[00:26:41.840 --> 00:26:44.680]   And there's no user benefit to doing this.
[00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:45.880]   Right.
[00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:49.680]   Yeah, they're trying to pitch it that way, but your friends want to know what you like.
[00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:53.240]   The benefit is that you get to see, look, when I when I check in somewhere on four
[00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:58.120]   square, if it says Leo has been here, which it does, it'll tell me which my friends have been to a place.
[00:26:58.120 --> 00:26:59.200]   That's useful information.
[00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:01.320]   And we give you any tips that I
[00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:03.760]   share even more information.
[00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:07.320]   But even if my friends have just been to a place that I'd never been to before,
[00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:09.520]   I I my brain connects.
[00:27:09.520 --> 00:27:11.680]   I see the faces of my friends to me.
[00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:13.720]   There's a little bit of an implicit endorsement there.
[00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:15.240]   Like I want to be here too.
[00:27:15.240 --> 00:27:19.720]   So, but is it wrong for four square to do this?
[00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:22.240]   Well, here's these are very close.
[00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:24.160]   These are similar things, but they're also very different.
[00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:24.840]   Right.
[00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:31.960]   Leo's pasta palace puts up a billboard in the street and it puts your face and says
[00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:34.200]   Gina, Japan, four stars.
[00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:36.120]   That's wrong, right?
[00:27:36.120 --> 00:27:37.560]   Well, why is that any different?
[00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:42.720]   Although it happens all the time in fair use situations, if you in fact, you know this,
[00:27:42.920 --> 00:27:44.840]   if your name, I'm sure, was used frequently.
[00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:49.760]   Jeff Jarvis gives moonlighting for stars and there's nothing you can do about that,
[00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:52.120]   Jeff, because you did review it in public.
[00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:54.320]   Yeah, I mean, that happens to blogs all the time.
[00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:55.960]   I find Life Hacker logos everywhere.
[00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:58.600]   Is this different?
[00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:03.080]   But you know, there is, but I don't know how that that squares with that that's
[00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:06.160]   quoting, but squaring with using your likeness to endorse a product.
[00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:08.360]   I'm by the way, I am with you guys.
[00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:12.880]   I hate this. And of course, I immediately unchecked it, particularly because
[00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:14.320]   it eats into my own revenue.
[00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:15.680]   We sell my endorsement.
[00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:19.600]   That's that's the only way we make money on Twitter is by selling my endorsement.
[00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:20.080]   Right.
[00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:23.440]   That's a huge business value.
[00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:24.880]   There is no business without that.
[00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:29.320]   So I'm very careful about my endorsement.
[00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:34.840]   On the other hand, you know, why do people review things on
[00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:37.680]   sites because they want their friends to see the reviews, right?
[00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:39.000]   They don't you don't review something.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:42.840]   You don't give something stars because you don't want anybody to see it.
[00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:44.520]   That's exactly right.
[00:28:44.520 --> 00:28:48.120]   Whenever a brand says like us on Facebook, whenever I see my friends, you know,
[00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:51.240]   it says like 12 year friends like Pepsi or whatever, I always think to myself,
[00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:56.080]   like they're shit, you know, that's a that's a declaration of public declaration
[00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:57.760]   about it is a public endorsement.
[00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:02.400]   It always baffles me because I just very rarely like stuff on Facebook or plus one
[00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:05.120]   stuff unless it's something that I really, really, really like unless it's
[00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:09.000]   something that I would feel comfortable everybody knowing and whatever context.
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.400]   And I think that we have to like think about our plus ones and our faves and our
[00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:14.720]   mistakes that way as a public statement.
[00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:16.160]   You might have to get a coupon.
[00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:17.120]   I've seen that a lot.
[00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:19.400]   Well, I have a question to get this or that.
[00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:21.880]   Have any of you ever reviewed anything on Amazon?
[00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:23.040]   Yes, yes.
[00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:24.760]   Yeah. Yeah.
[00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:26.960]   Well, that's public.
[00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:32.120]   Yeah. And that's I mean, that takes effort and time and I mean, that's that to me
[00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:35.200]   is the same as writing a post or a blog post, right?
[00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:37.400]   I mean, it's a it's a public thing.
[00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:39.880]   But the difference there is I can see all the post Leo.
[00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:41.960]   I can see all the positive and the negative.
[00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:44.920]   Right. And they're only going to show the five stars.
[00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:49.720]   It's like it's like the schmuck guy at a certain network when I was a TV critic.
[00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:52.280]   You know,
[00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:55.200]   what's that?
[00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:57.760]   No, they do this in movie reviews all the time.
[00:29:57.760 --> 00:29:59.560]   No, they do this in movie reviews all the time.
[00:29:59.560 --> 00:30:03.280]   Jeff Jarvis said I was on my feet.
[00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:06.200]   And but they don't they leave out the part where it says Lee
[00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:07.080]   fast.
[00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:09.680]   We're getting the hell out there.
[00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:13.120]   They do that. They misrepresent critics all the time.
[00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:14.440]   You don't have a recourse.
[00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:17.720]   Bottom line is this just doesn't seem like a very googly thing to do.
[00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:19.120]   It doesn't.
[00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:21.240]   It seems like a face book thing to do.
[00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:23.200]   It does seem like a face thing to do.
[00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:24.280]   It really does.
[00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:25.360]   Face bookie.
[00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:26.200]   Face bookie.
[00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:29.040]   It's as good as googly.
[00:30:29.040 --> 00:30:32.800]   I have also a problem with the fall of a couple of people in the chat room are
[00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:35.120]   noting that went to their settings that it was unchecked.
[00:30:35.120 --> 00:30:37.600]   I had the same thing. It was unchecked when I was in my settings.
[00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:41.200]   But Google is saying that those are people who had opted out
[00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:43.800]   of some sort of advertising setting in the past.
[00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:44.400]   Interesting.
[00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:45.560]   Possibly could have done.
[00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:49.320]   So they're trying to honor your general feeling.
[00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:51.960]   If you've expressed it, mine was checked.
[00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:53.240]   Mine was checked.
[00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:57.640]   I don't know what setting that they took that signal from.
[00:30:57.640 --> 00:30:59.280]   But but yeah, mine was unchecked.
[00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:02.280]   So there was something there that it was reading from the past that it made.
[00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:03.800]   I'm showing this with Gina.
[00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:06.120]   Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:15.680]   So we see the effort to have the what's now called the Schmidt faced campaign.
[00:31:15.680 --> 00:31:19.520]   Yeah, everybody's putting Eric Schmidt's face.
[00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:24.680]   They're changing their profile picture on Google plus to Eric Schmidt's face or
[00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:32.440]   their or their making posts saying use Eric's picture all you want.
[00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:35.160]   That's pretty funny.
[00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:36.400]   I won't go back.
[00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:37.800]   It's funny.
[00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:41.600]   I know. Yeah, it's that's I think the biggest issue, right?
[00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:43.840]   I mean, I understand Google needs to monetize.
[00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:44.800]   It's just such a face.
[00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:46.600]   Yeah, I'm not outraged.
[00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:47.400]   I'm disappointed.
[00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:50.080]   Yeah. What if they what if they shared in the monetization?
[00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:55.360]   What if they said, hey, if we if we use your if we use your image and someone buys
[00:31:55.360 --> 00:31:57.360]   something, then you get a small percent.
[00:31:57.360 --> 00:31:58.680]   That's actually a great idea.
[00:31:58.680 --> 00:31:59.920]   That is a great idea.
[00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:02.960]   I would totally I would totally go back and change my setting to check if they
[00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:04.440]   go here. But you know, I mean, here's the problem.
[00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:06.000]   Then then it right.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:09.040]   I was thinking about that too, Aaron, but then it gets gamed.
[00:32:09.040 --> 00:32:11.600]   Well, let's say they just gave you a play credit, right?
[00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:13.080]   Just make it. Yeah, I like credit.
[00:32:13.080 --> 00:32:13.640]   Yeah.
[00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:16.120]   But then we're just going to see if somebody's going to like everything we could
[00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:17.880]   possibly like, right?
[00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:21.480]   And then that cuts is busy trying to figure out how to figure out a new form of
[00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:22.840]   spam, right?
[00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:26.560]   But I agree, there should be some value back that give me a reason to do it.
[00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:30.760]   Because that's the more you know, let me know when you know, or make it more
[00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:35.240]   and let me know when friends bought something that I recommended.
[00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:38.840]   You know, I use affiliate deals.
[00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:42.120]   That's the way to do it or on the ad say, see what your friends have said about
[00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:44.200]   this product and let me click and go to it.
[00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:49.680]   But to just slap my face on their ad without my explicit permission.
[00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:51.000]   Facebooky.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:51.600]   Facebooky.
[00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:52.880]   Here's an interesting thing.
[00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:58.480]   Google is going to apparently, according to Engadget, pay people for using
[00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:04.120]   their iOS or Android mobile meter apps that monitor your app, huge hidden web
[00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:08.680]   browsing habits and send the data back to Google, Google will offer you rewards.
[00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:10.720]   Actually, Google says it's just rumor.
[00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:11.840]   It's speculation.
[00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:15.800]   But then gadget sources say Google will offer you rewards with the mobile meter
[00:33:15.800 --> 00:33:20.800]   program, you'll have to give your extent, obviously, install the app, opt in.
[00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:24.040]   And it's not clear what those rewards will be.
[00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:26.880]   Google does confirm development of the new apps.
[00:33:27.080 --> 00:33:32.600]   This is part of a marketing project called market research project called Screen Wise.
[00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:36.280]   So you'll be an effective panelist.
[00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:37.880]   Yeah, Google rewards you in other ways.
[00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:42.520]   If you're a really active Google+ user, you can get, you know, be marked as one and
[00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:43.400]   get swag.
[00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:44.760]   I mean, there's things we do.
[00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:48.120]   So there is precedent, perhaps, for Google
[00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:50.160]   rewarding you for participating.
[00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:52.880]   It's rather just unclever, right?
[00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:58.920]   If if I'm a good product endorser and people buy things I endorse and in turn,
[00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:02.880]   like them and endorse them, that becomes an interesting social system that can be
[00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:05.960]   created, but this is just so obvious.
[00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:08.920]   I think I think the attitude here is similar to what Mark Zuckerberg's
[00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:13.000]   attitude is, which is why wouldn't you want to let your friends know?
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:14.360]   Well, here's the funny thing.
[00:34:14.360 --> 00:34:17.760]   But the feedback loop, though, is is key, right?
[00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:21.680]   Like the it would make me really happy if I heard from my friends that they all
[00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:24.680]   bought Nexus 7s because they saw my endorsement.
[00:34:24.680 --> 00:34:26.840]   And yeah, they really liked it or they really hated it.
[00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:27.800]   What was I thinking?
[00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:28.040]   Right?
[00:34:28.040 --> 00:34:29.360]   Like that would complete the loop for me.
[00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:32.440]   That would even be even as that would be as good as a play credit for me.
[00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:36.600]   In my case, that they didn't buy it on Verizon because I thought not to.
[00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:37.320]   Yes.
[00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:38.800]   And I didn't buy it on Verizon.
[00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:39.280]   Thanks to Jeff.
[00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:42.320]   That's why Jeff is on the show.
[00:34:42.320 --> 00:34:44.840]   Keep people from buying it on Verizon.
[00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:47.480]   When they still have it, they still have it.
[00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:48.520]   It's been another week.
[00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:49.600]   It's now five weeks.
[00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:52.800]   There's nothing they could do right now because the government's shut.
[00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:54.320]   So
[00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:55.000]   Mr.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:56.200]   Leport,
[00:34:56.200 --> 00:34:59.400]   it's already certified as workable.
[00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:01.280]   It's already working in every network.
[00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:02.720]   There is absolutely nothing they need.
[00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:05.320]   But to just put a skew in their system that would go up.
[00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:08.200]   Well, they're they're waiting for a call.
[00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:08.800]   Do it.
[00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:11.240]   They're waiting for the FCC to return their call.
[00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:12.360]   No, no.
[00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:16.400]   He says to tell them that FCC is out right now.
[00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:18.320]   So they can't bring them to the justice.
[00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:19.080]   They deserve it.
[00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:19.960]   Oh, maybe that's it.
[00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:21.480]   The big guy is in public shame.
[00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:24.880]   Maybe that's what's going to happen tomorrow when the government gets back to work.
[00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:26.480]   You're going to get satisfaction, Jeff.
[00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:30.680]   First priority is go after friggin Verizon.
[00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:31.400]   Didn't you?
[00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:33.040]   You did file a complaint, didn't you?
[00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:33.880]   Oh, yes.
[00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:34.520]   Oh, yes.
[00:35:34.520 --> 00:35:35.880]   Have you heard anything back?
[00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:39.840]   I filed back again and said, "No, no, no, no, no."
[00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:41.840]   You know, I back to back to Beacon.
[00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:45.200]   When I interviewed Zuckerberg for my book, Public Parts,
[00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:47.080]   he said Beacon was a big mistake.
[00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:49.680]   I said, "Well, Mark, you know, I can imagine that you could fix it this way."
[00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:50.160]   He interrupted.
[00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:51.840]   He said, "No, it was a mistake."
[00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:52.920]   People didn't want that.
[00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:53.880]   We shouldn't have done that.
[00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:55.200]   It was a mistake.
[00:35:55.200 --> 00:35:59.920]   Well, maybe Larry should learn from his friend Mark.
[00:35:59.920 --> 00:36:03.760]   Related to the mobile meter story,
[00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:08.760]   Facebook just bought a nave, a no, I'm not sure how to pronounce it,
[00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:11.800]   but it's basically a mobile app analytics company.
[00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:15.320]   I noticed the news because I had featured one of their analytics apps on
[00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:17.000]   Android, it was on my arena picks.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:20.560]   And it's basically the one that I featured is an app that monitors your
[00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:24.240]   mobile usage and tells you which apps are consuming the most bandwidth and how much,
[00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:27.560]   you know, categories of what kind of bandwidth you're using.
[00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:30.160]   There's always Facebook that uses the most.
[00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:32.000]   Oh, wait, it's true.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   Facebook and Instagram were consistently one of the highest bandwidth hogging,
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:39.560]   which either means they're being used a lot or they're just bandwidth hogs,
[00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:40.960]   probably both.
[00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:44.320]   But it's interesting, like, where these companies are basically asking for
[00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:47.840]   users permission to install spyware to see how we're going to, you know,
[00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:50.760]   there's a lot of good that could come out of that, like understanding how
[00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:55.200]   users consume data on smartphones is one of, you know, is an important part of
[00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:59.600]   extending our networks and increasing coverage and, you know, getting Verizon
[00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:03.960]   to work on Jeff's Nexus 7.
[00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:07.480]   But it's like, it feels like the key loggers of like back in the day, you know,
[00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:10.280]   when those like, some key loggers that would get installed on our Windows
[00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:11.960]   machines and watch what we do.
[00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:16.120]   Big bucks for this, $150 to $200 million for our neighbor.
[00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:18.480]   Spensive.
[00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:23.960]   So with the Nexus 5, we thought we'd see it by Monday.
[00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:25.560]   I'm holding off.
[00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:29.920]   I'm kind of, you know, ever since T-Mobile announced a couple of days ago that
[00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:34.320]   they're going to offer free international data roaming.
[00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:35.960]   That is so huge.
[00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:37.640]   It's edge only, I found out.
[00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:40.600]   So it's not I'm not like quite as excited about it.
[00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:42.160]   But it's what it's what I get.
[00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:47.240]   You know, I when I'm on my AT&T now and, you know, this piece of life, I pay,
[00:37:47.240 --> 00:37:50.000]   but I'm overdoing my big Davos thing.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.560]   I pay a hundred bucks extra for that month for the data and then I get close
[00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:54.200]   to going over.
[00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:54.680]   Yeah.
[00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:57.920]   And you don't I paid 250 bucks to get 800 megabytes.
[00:37:57.920 --> 00:38:01.960]   That's the biggest package they offer on my travels.
[00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:03.080]   It's expensive.
[00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:07.560]   So now admittedly, that's three and four G in areas where you can get it.
[00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:10.760]   But I I'm as soon as T-Mobile announced this, I said, great.
[00:38:10.760 --> 00:38:11.520]   That's it.
[00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:13.800]   When I travel, it's T-Mobile only, right?
[00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:16.800]   And it's in most of the countries you go to, you can find out more about it.
[00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:20.080]   And that makes the Nexus 5 to mean more compelling actually makes it
[00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:23.080]   next is for compelling because even though it doesn't have LTE, I don't even need LTE.
[00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:27.840]   Well, as reports now, I saw reports that might be a new Nexus 4 with LTE.
[00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:29.200]   Interesting.
[00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:30.280]   I saw that one report.
[00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:32.400]   You can't buy the Nexus 4 now.
[00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:33.720]   Yeah, they were doing it right.
[00:38:33.720 --> 00:38:34.040]   Yeah.
[00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:39.280]   The most important thing about the Nexus 5 is that the slightest little tiny
[00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:44.160]   thought or rumor or guess gets spread and metastasized like and rummash rate.
[00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:45.560]   It's like a game of telephone.
[00:38:45.560 --> 00:38:47.400]   Oh, it's out of control.
[00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:52.080]   So I search every day for Nexus 5, the way I used to search every day for Nexus 7 LTE.
[00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:53.680]   And because I want to know what's going on.
[00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:55.680]   Nexus 4, we are out of inventory.
[00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:59.520]   Please check back soon on both the 8 and 16 gig.
[00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:00.200]   You're continuing.
[00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:01.360]   You think I take it down?
[00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:02.520]   Yeah, you didn't take it down.
[00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:06.520]   I mean, we've seen a lot about the Nexus 5.
[00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:07.760]   Here's my theory.
[00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:12.920]   The FCC was shut down by this government shutdown 16 days ago.
[00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:14.560]   The reason we know anything about the
[00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:18.840]   Nexus 5 is because of FCC approvals of the Bluetooth radio and things like that.
[00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:21.520]   I bet there's some approvals that are just hanging.
[00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:24.480]   And as soon as they go through, then maybe Google can release it.
[00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:26.720]   Gene was telling us a variety.
[00:39:26.720 --> 00:39:30.400]   I guess this is from all about Andrea last night, a variety of release dates
[00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:33.800]   based on everything from astrology to hit songs.
[00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:37.320]   Well, so on the Google Plus page, the KitKat Google Plus page,
[00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:41.880]   this is Google Plus.Google.com/pluskitcat, which is run.
[00:39:41.880 --> 00:39:46.160]   And we're actually we can't tell if it's run by by Hershey's or by Google,
[00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:50.120]   but it is clearly like an Android branded, you know, KitKat page.
[00:39:50.120 --> 00:39:55.480]   They keep posting these images which appear to be clues to the release date.
[00:39:55.480 --> 00:40:00.360]   So the first one that they posted was a chocolate KitKat Android dancing.
[00:40:00.560 --> 00:40:03.240]   And the caption was everybody dance now.
[00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:06.840]   So people looked up and said, oh, everybody dance now was a hit single
[00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:11.640]   released by CNC Music Factory on October 18th, 1990.
[00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:13.840]   October 18th must be the release date.
[00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:18.960]   And then they posted an image which says, this is it in KitKat bars.
[00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:23.760]   Now, this is it is the name of Michael Jackson documentary, which was released on
[00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:27.000]   October 28th.
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:30.120]   So everyone said, OK, it's definitely the 28th because CNC
[00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:33.120]   factory used to be named like the 28th Brigade or something.
[00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:34.920]   Must be the 28th, right?
[00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:37.000]   That is ridiculous.
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:42.560]   And on all of Android, we are guess is that it's Halloween because KitKat is a
[00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:45.000]   Halloween candy. We really have no idea.
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:49.840]   I think it's I think it's hilarious that that Google is clearly baiting Android
[00:40:49.840 --> 00:40:53.840]   enthusiasts and bloggers with the so-called hints about.
[00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:55.320]   But it dance now.
[00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:57.440]   Everybody dance now.
[00:40:57.640 --> 00:41:01.180]   So I'm told we talk about this on Mac
[00:41:01.180 --> 00:41:06.840]   Break Weekly that the artists to create apples invitations to their events
[00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:10.800]   released, you know, when the invitation goes out, they sit around reading tech
[00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:16.160]   blogs, watching shows like this, drinking and laughing at all of the speculation
[00:41:16.160 --> 00:41:17.120]   that occurs.
[00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:20.600]   And I imagine the KitKat folks are probably jowling down right now in a chocolate
[00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:22.600]   bar just howling.
[00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:27.120]   I doubt very much that they said everybody danced now as a
[00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:30.080]   very obscure clue to a release date.
[00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:32.880]   But maybe that's pretty googly Leo.
[00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:34.680]   It's pretty googly.
[00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:38.320]   OK, it is googly, but I don't think this is a Google account.
[00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:40.640]   Well, that's the thing is this points back to KitKat.
[00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:44.160]   KitKat.com. And if you even if you go to KitKat.com, it's amazing to me.
[00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:47.760]   They built their whole site around Android.
[00:41:47.760 --> 00:41:49.080]   It's incredible.
[00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:52.200]   I mean, we in case you missed it, you might want to go back and take a look.
[00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:55.360]   We looked at their website and it's all like I can see Google writing this for
[00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:57.600]   saying, Hey, look, we'll give you the whole code.
[00:41:57.600 --> 00:42:00.720]   Just go throw this up on your website because it says KitKat for.
[00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:02.760]   For all this stuff.
[00:42:02.760 --> 00:42:08.800]   And it's all like a technology website for selling some sort of phone or new gadget
[00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:09.480]   or something.
[00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:12.440]   Well, wait a minute, let's do who is on the KitKat site.
[00:42:12.440 --> 00:42:15.080]   And find out who owns.
[00:42:15.080 --> 00:42:18.200]   Well, we'll see how obscure this information is anyway.
[00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:20.880]   It's going to be an ad agency.
[00:42:20.880 --> 00:42:24.960]   Oh, it's owned by Nestle, folks.
[00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:29.520]   Yeah, but they definitely owned KitKat.com before this partnership.
[00:42:29.520 --> 00:42:30.960]   Ah, that's true.
[00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:31.320]   Right.
[00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:34.920]   This record expires in May, 2014.
[00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:37.400]   It was created May 1997.
[00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:40.120]   So, yes, they've owned it for some time.
[00:42:40.120 --> 00:42:42.800]   Registered through two cows.
[00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:45.240]   Nestle.com.
[00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:46.880]   How old for the kingdom?
[00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:49.280]   Yes.
[00:42:49.280 --> 00:42:51.160]   So, yeah, I guess there's nothing to be deduced.
[00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:54.200]   They already owned the domain.
[00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:59.600]   Nope, but no, remember, no money was changed at any time for this fabulous relationship.
[00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:02.440]   There are teams of people who were hired to implement this.
[00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:05.600]   But no money was exchanged.
[00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:06.800]   Very important.
[00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:10.880]   They just like they like Android that much that they decided to read their whole website.
[00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:13.000]   We just love how it's like.
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:13.600]   Yeah.
[00:43:13.600 --> 00:43:14.840]   I do like chocolate, Leo.
[00:43:14.840 --> 00:43:15.720]   Yeah.
[00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:17.240]   You're just being cynical.
[00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:18.200]   Yeah.
[00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:23.160]   So, um, and and does that is it related to the Nexus five?
[00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:26.120]   Like they're going to release the same, the two at the same time.
[00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:28.920]   That's the, yeah, that's the question.
[00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:30.160]   Yeah.
[00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:32.400]   Yeah, because actually they would because you're not released.
[00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:33.960]   You don't release KitKat.
[00:43:33.960 --> 00:43:36.000]   You have to put out a product with KitKat on it.
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:40.960]   I mean, most of the time, it's meaningless to say, well, download KitKat.
[00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:43.120]   Yeah, it's your air push release.
[00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:44.480]   Yeah, they're definitely going to be able to buy it.
[00:43:44.480 --> 00:43:46.440]   They're going to be a flagship device.
[00:43:46.440 --> 00:43:47.680]   There's a device.
[00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:49.440]   Right. And then we've already seen screenshots.
[00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:50.240]   Right.
[00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:53.640]   Phones running this next is five display.
[00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:55.400]   It's already in Best Buy.
[00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:57.560]   There is a Nexus five display in Best Buy.
[00:43:57.560 --> 00:43:59.320]   There are phones on it, but it's a Google.
[00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:03.680]   Interesting thing and three spots for phones to be up there.
[00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:06.560]   And, and, you know, whoever put the picture up said, I asked the manager.
[00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:07.960]   Yes, it's the Nexus five.
[00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:09.920]   Well, we were thinking Tuesday.
[00:44:09.920 --> 00:44:13.360]   I'm thinking maybe it was planned Tuesday and it's just been held up by the
[00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:16.400]   government closure in the United States.
[00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:22.280]   The rumor, according to a Romanian Android blog that we're down to that.
[00:44:22.280 --> 00:44:26.720]   There is there's the empty display.
[00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:29.120]   Wow, does the same X is five anywhere?
[00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:31.960]   Just the guy asked the as the manager.
[00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:34.440]   The other thing that I've seen again, it's meaningless is just, you know,
[00:44:34.440 --> 00:44:38.400]   report ever report mutating, but said that this time was not going to have the
[00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:44.840]   supply problems of the Nexus four and that it was going to be
[00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:48.960]   available all over and stores and so on and so forth, which I hope is the case.
[00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:50.640]   I don't want to be screaming at myself.
[00:44:50.640 --> 00:44:52.080]   We're taking a smaller unit.
[00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:53.400]   I want to get the larger memory this time.
[00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:56.840]   And, you know, I've been playing with the Galaxy Note three for a week and I love it.
[00:44:56.840 --> 00:44:58.240]   And, you know, I like the notes.
[00:44:58.240 --> 00:44:59.640]   I like the big phones, but I'm not going to buy it.
[00:44:59.640 --> 00:45:03.320]   I cannot use touch was I want a googly phone.
[00:45:03.320 --> 00:45:05.320]   Yes, I like my Moto X.
[00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:10.880]   I wish I had it on T mobile, but I wanted a red back and I could only get that on AT&T.
[00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:14.040]   So that's why I got a lock now.
[00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:15.280]   Huh? I get a lock.
[00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:16.760]   You paid for it, so you can get a lock.
[00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:18.000]   I get it on lock, sure.
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:21.640]   I mean, that's why I put Google edition on my Samsung Galaxy S4 as soon as I got it,
[00:45:21.640 --> 00:45:22.760]   right? Because I hate touch was.
[00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:24.640]   So now it looks just like a Google phone.
[00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:25.840]   That's not so bad. Yeah.
[00:45:25.840 --> 00:45:27.880]   Yeah. And that's it's totally work.
[00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:29.040]   The camera work well and everything.
[00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:29.800]   The camera works well.
[00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:31.240]   In fact, I'll talk about that a little bit later.
[00:45:31.240 --> 00:45:35.240]   OK. And and you know what the best part about it is is because it's not running
[00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:38.240]   all that touch was crap in the background, I double the battery life.
[00:45:38.240 --> 00:45:42.040]   Yeah, you double the storage because those next those GS fours come with.
[00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:44.760]   Yes, scant storage because of all the crapola.
[00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:46.080]   That's right. So you went.
[00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:47.280]   What is it? A 16 gig?
[00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:48.440]   It's yeah, it's a 16 gig.
[00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:50.760]   So I started out with touch was I think I had nine points.
[00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:51.880]   Something already used.
[00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:52.920]   Oh, used.
[00:45:52.920 --> 00:45:55.440]   You only cow and I went down to four points.
[00:45:55.440 --> 00:45:56.040]   Isn't that awesome?
[00:45:56.040 --> 00:45:58.120]   Five free gigs just by getting rid of it.
[00:45:58.120 --> 00:45:59.920]   And it runs better in the battery last long.
[00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:00.840]   Good. I'm going to do that.
[00:46:00.840 --> 00:46:01.960]   Is that an easy thing to do?
[00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:02.480]   Very easy.
[00:46:02.480 --> 00:46:03.200]   OK.
[00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:03.960]   You have to root it.
[00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:06.560]   The Microsoft phones.
[00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:10.520]   I have I had problems with the with the triangle count.
[00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:13.720]   You know, the right, you can you reset that now?
[00:46:13.720 --> 00:46:14.400]   I'll have to look.
[00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:18.120]   I I had some failed rooting efforts.
[00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:20.160]   So my count is now maxed.
[00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:21.720]   Oops, oops.
[00:46:21.720 --> 00:46:22.520]   I'll do it.
[00:46:22.520 --> 00:46:24.920]   If you want to help me help me help me.
[00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:31.360]   I'm going to be the camera on the motor wax get improved.
[00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:32.040]   What's that reason?
[00:46:32.040 --> 00:46:33.080]   Yeah, the firmware upgrade.
[00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:36.320]   Yeah, I guess I cannot see it.
[00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:37.920]   Well, I don't know.
[00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:39.720]   They said it. Yeah, sure.
[00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:41.800]   I'm sure it did.
[00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:47.440]   It's still it's still, you know, I mean, there's only so much you could do to make it better.
[00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:51.240]   You know, some of that's hardware, but I guess they said the color renditions better.
[00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:53.440]   And I don't know.
[00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:54.120]   I don't know.
[00:46:54.120 --> 00:46:58.560]   I took a lot of truth is I didn't it wasn't it wasn't ever awful.
[00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:00.320]   Let me go look at my pictures and see.
[00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:04.880]   Very it was it was had a little green cast, which as far as I can tell.
[00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:09.840]   So this was taken with it before the update.
[00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:11.480]   And you can even see the little green cast.
[00:47:11.480 --> 00:47:14.040]   In fact, you do not see my screen anymore.
[00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:14.640]   Oh, you do.
[00:47:14.640 --> 00:47:17.080]   So you can see the little green cast on there.
[00:47:17.080 --> 00:47:19.800]   In fact, I have I did a little trial because that guy on the left,
[00:47:19.800 --> 00:47:24.160]   Jamal has an iPhone had iPhone 5s and his picture was so much better.
[00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:25.400]   Does that mean going black?
[00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:27.360]   Gosh darn it.
[00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:29.600]   And then I took this after I think it is better.
[00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:32.640]   This actually the color rendition looks a lot better on this.
[00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:34.360]   Yeah, it does.
[00:47:34.360 --> 00:47:35.240]   Unless I did that.
[00:47:35.240 --> 00:47:35.840]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:47:35.840 --> 00:47:37.280]   I did that with my phone 5s.
[00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:40.080]   I wonder it's better.
[00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:42.080]   Turn it both of these are iPhone 5s.
[00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:43.920]   Never mind.
[00:47:43.920 --> 00:47:47.360]   I'll take a picture with my Moto and post it.
[00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:49.360]   I should take an identical picture here.
[00:47:49.360 --> 00:47:51.400]   I'll do an identical one.
[00:47:51.400 --> 00:47:56.920]   The one that looks just like Andy, but this time it'll be Gina.
[00:47:56.920 --> 00:47:58.880]   I think it's not quite as good.
[00:47:58.880 --> 00:47:59.880]   It'll take a little while to upload.
[00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:00.600]   That looked funny.
[00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:01.960]   You shake it.
[00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:05.040]   I like this this everything about the Moto X I like.
[00:48:05.240 --> 00:48:10.760]   The fact that I have a little NFC tag right here that keeps it unlocked.
[00:48:10.760 --> 00:48:13.360]   I like the fact that it doesn't.
[00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:15.320]   The Moto Assist is surprisingly useful.
[00:48:15.320 --> 00:48:19.280]   That's that little app that knows if you're driving or in a meeting or sleeping.
[00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:21.600]   And it's never bugged me on shows ever since.
[00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:23.320]   I used to have to turn the phone off.
[00:48:23.320 --> 00:48:28.160]   I just made sure that every show was a meeting by adding a person.
[00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:31.440]   And now it no longer rings during shows, which is very nice.
[00:48:31.440 --> 00:48:32.240]   Incredibly useful.
[00:48:32.440 --> 00:48:35.120]   It's little things like that. It's not huge.
[00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:36.680]   Just little things.
[00:48:36.680 --> 00:48:39.120]   I think I got some pretty good pictures while I was traveling.
[00:48:39.120 --> 00:48:40.960]   These are all Moto X pictures.
[00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:46.080]   And I think that the I think the color rendition was pretty pretty good, actually.
[00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:50.480]   Yeah, I mean, this is before the firmware upgrade.
[00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:53.360]   So I think that there's enough light.
[00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:55.240]   This camera is pretty good.
[00:48:55.240 --> 00:48:58.920]   It's not iPhone 5 quality, but it's OK.
[00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:02.480]   Those are really nice.
[00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:05.760]   I don't think that this is bad.
[00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:09.480]   And some of these are very low light.
[00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:12.200]   These are all with the Moto X.
[00:49:12.200 --> 00:49:15.520]   You see, and this this is one thing I've always had a problem with the Moto X lens flare.
[00:49:15.520 --> 00:49:18.400]   Yeah, for some reason, bright light, it just really baffles it.
[00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:19.520]   Yeah.
[00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:23.560]   This is this is in a very dark cistern.
[00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:29.560]   And it actually was able to it's grainy, you know, it's noisy, but it was able to get a picture.
[00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:33.040]   And it's it's really dark here.
[00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:34.760]   That's the Medusa's head upside down.
[00:49:34.760 --> 00:49:35.520]   That's the cistern.
[00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:38.040]   It's just that's the kind of lighting.
[00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:41.200]   So that's not that it's OK.
[00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:44.960]   Don't buy it for the camera.
[00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:47.840]   Oh, let's see moving along.
[00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:50.520]   Other stories on our mind today.
[00:49:50.520 --> 00:49:52.000]   Now I'm want to kick out bar.
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:54.560]   I blame you at age.
[00:49:54.760 --> 00:49:58.880]   At age says Microsoft scribble ads work.
[00:49:58.880 --> 00:50:03.760]   I would have thought that these ads would have infuriated people or they would have been baffled.
[00:50:03.760 --> 00:50:09.840]   But according to adage, oh, see, proving that it does call you.
[00:50:09.840 --> 00:50:12.280]   OK, well, you know why.
[00:50:12.280 --> 00:50:13.840]   By the way, I like my ring time.
[00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:18.600]   You know why, because this moron who's calling it next time you call my give out your phone number
[00:50:18.600 --> 00:50:22.840]   knows that the meaning thing doesn't I have it set so that if somebody rings twice
[00:50:23.040 --> 00:50:25.200]   the same number almost be an emergency.
[00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:31.320]   So they called once I saw the call come in and it didn't ring and then they called immediately again.
[00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:37.280]   So I have it set so that if favorite family members call it rings and second
[00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:43.760]   second ring rings, you know what I'm going to do is just change that setting and you'll be at a luck 714.
[00:50:43.760 --> 00:50:46.400]   That's my mom.
[00:50:48.600 --> 00:50:52.400]   The scruggled ads negative the core a rarity for consumer attack.
[00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:53.400]   Even the mean spirited.
[00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:54.080]   I'm a Mac.
[00:50:54.080 --> 00:50:56.760]   I'm a PC featured a product comparison at least.
[00:50:56.760 --> 00:51:01.040]   But while the tactics may be ugly, says at age, the ads are working according to two
[00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:03.480]   ad effectiveness firms and research.
[00:51:03.480 --> 00:51:06.960]   Oh, wait a minute, commissioned by Microsoft Microsoft.
[00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:07.680]   This is my fault.
[00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:08.240]   I put this up.
[00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:09.280]   I really should read is.
[00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:10.280]   Yeah, I think you should.
[00:51:10.280 --> 00:51:11.240]   I'm not going to do that.
[00:51:11.240 --> 00:51:12.280]   That would be mean.
[00:51:12.280 --> 00:51:12.960]   I'm not going to.
[00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:13.400]   You're nice.
[00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:14.000]   You're nice guy.
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:18.520]   Stoop to his level, but I will give up the last two numbers and scare him.
[00:51:18.520 --> 00:51:21.800]   I started with the area code.
[00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:24.360]   I don't know why people are this way.
[00:51:24.360 --> 00:51:28.520]   I just it's very sad, frankly, to me.
[00:51:28.520 --> 00:51:34.760]   Mike for Microsoft, it's a win said the executive vice president at Ace Metrix.
[00:51:34.760 --> 00:51:37.520]   More than 53% of people who saw the scruggled ads.
[00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:39.480]   You know, I don't need to describe those, right?
[00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:44.280]   Those are the ads where Microsoft goes, you know, it was scruggled by Google.
[00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:48.400]   53% of the viewers mentioned Google in their response to the ads and said they
[00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:53.200]   would look at being in a new light or at least seek more information.
[00:51:53.200 --> 00:51:54.200]   Let us be clear.
[00:51:54.200 --> 00:51:55.680]   This was done for Microsoft.
[00:51:55.680 --> 00:52:01.360]   Well, no, this is so according to two ad effectiveness
[00:52:01.360 --> 00:52:04.560]   firms and research commissioned by Microsoft.
[00:52:04.560 --> 00:52:07.200]   Oh, I so I don't know if
[00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:10.800]   ad benchmark index said they have certainly raised a level.
[00:52:10.800 --> 00:52:14.320]   I thought I thought I turned this guy off.
[00:52:14.520 --> 00:52:21.560]   Maybe the maybe the silent setting isn't working because he's got a special number.
[00:52:21.560 --> 00:52:23.160]   That's interesting.
[00:52:23.160 --> 00:52:24.600]   Oh, now I know what that means.
[00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:27.960]   So that means it will override even silence.
[00:52:27.960 --> 00:52:33.080]   So I have to go into a system that's too bad because it's thinking you really want
[00:52:33.080 --> 00:52:33.600]   to hear from this guy.
[00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:36.720]   I must really this guy's called like a bunch of times.
[00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:40.040]   He must really want to talk to me.
[00:52:40.040 --> 00:52:43.560]   Maybe you want a million dollars.
[00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:44.880]   OK, there you go.
[00:52:44.880 --> 00:52:45.560]   Keep trying.
[00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:47.760]   Good luck.
[00:52:47.760 --> 00:52:48.680]   Once you.
[00:52:48.680 --> 00:52:52.800]   So one of the way they can measure this is they sent people to a site called
[00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:55.200]   scruggled.com.
[00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:57.480]   Once viewers do hit scruggled.com.
[00:52:57.480 --> 00:52:59.680]   Now, this is the Microsoft stuff.
[00:52:59.680 --> 00:53:01.680]   Data collected for Microsoft by answers.
[00:53:01.680 --> 00:53:06.120]   Research show a 45% favorability gap in favor of Google.
[00:53:06.120 --> 00:53:07.760]   Contracting to just 5%.
[00:53:07.760 --> 00:53:09.880]   In other words, when they go in,
[00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:15.520]   45% are favorable by the time they read the crap, which is mostly disinformation,
[00:53:15.520 --> 00:53:18.720]   5% are favorable.
[00:53:18.720 --> 00:53:26.640]   Data shows the likelihood of someone recommending Google to a friend drops by 10%
[00:53:26.640 --> 00:53:29.640]   and increases for being 7%.
[00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:33.920]   I wonder if we'll see more of these ads in that case.
[00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:38.080]   And Google's kind of a prime target for this kind of thing because I think that
[00:53:38.280 --> 00:53:41.440]   people who don't talk about technology and think about technology every day, like we
[00:53:41.440 --> 00:53:47.640]   do, Google is so good that even we have these moments where we're like, how did
[00:53:47.640 --> 00:53:51.320]   it know that it plays to what they already kind of suspect, right?
[00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:52.360]   Yeah, just confirms you.
[00:53:52.360 --> 00:53:53.560]   It's playing on people's fears.
[00:53:53.560 --> 00:53:53.960]   Yeah.
[00:53:53.960 --> 00:53:54.320]   Yeah.
[00:53:54.320 --> 00:53:59.160]   Well, I think the bigger thing is not that it's the new program of the lads where
[00:53:59.160 --> 00:54:02.520]   if you search for something on Amazon and two days later, you see that same thing pop
[00:54:02.520 --> 00:54:05.520]   up in an ad in front of you that shocks people more.
[00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:07.920]   I hear.
[00:54:08.920 --> 00:54:10.120]   Yeah, that is surprising.
[00:54:10.120 --> 00:54:13.240]   You know, we had the baby and I started looking at, you know,
[00:54:13.240 --> 00:54:16.080]   looking at baby products more a lot more online.
[00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:20.880]   I would I would suddenly see ads for baby stuff, you know, and it was such a
[00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:24.320]   surprising it was to me, even though I understand how this works, I was like, oh,
[00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:25.320]   that's OK.
[00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:26.320]   Yeah, that works.
[00:54:26.320 --> 00:54:27.040]   That's really good.
[00:54:27.040 --> 00:54:28.720]   It was a noticeable shift.
[00:54:28.720 --> 00:54:31.040]   Yeah, it does surprise you that when you see it, right?
[00:54:31.040 --> 00:54:31.880]   It does.
[00:54:31.880 --> 00:54:32.320]   It does.
[00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:33.200]   Because you're not expecting it.
[00:54:33.400 --> 00:54:38.200]   You're like, you're like, do, do, do anything. Hey, I was like, what?
[00:54:38.200 --> 00:54:40.080]   I was researching car seats.
[00:54:40.080 --> 00:54:43.200]   And the next day I got an ad for the one that I was looking at, you know, that I was
[00:54:43.200 --> 00:54:45.160]   just about to buy, but then stopped midwigs.
[00:54:45.160 --> 00:54:49.080]   I got busy and I was like, whoa, oh, oh, yeah.
[00:54:49.080 --> 00:54:49.680]   Yeah.
[00:54:49.680 --> 00:54:50.120]   Yeah.
[00:54:50.120 --> 00:54:53.480]   So I mean, there's there's a there's a grain of truth there, but you know, I always
[00:54:53.480 --> 00:54:57.200]   wonder about these things like, you know, what happens to so I imagine these
[00:54:57.200 --> 00:54:58.800]   people like going into this room, right?
[00:54:58.800 --> 00:55:02.000]   And they watch this ad and then they immediately put down like what they think.
[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:02.400]   Right.
[00:55:02.600 --> 00:55:05.760]   What what what about the day after that day after they don't even remember?
[00:55:05.760 --> 00:55:07.040]   Yeah, they're not going to remember.
[00:55:07.040 --> 00:55:08.640]   Like, is it really that effective?
[00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:12.680]   I mean, I know you're measuring it to the ideal here, but is it really that that
[00:55:12.680 --> 00:55:16.040]   effective the next day or maybe when Google announces something cool that comes
[00:55:16.040 --> 00:55:17.240]   out all of a sudden, oh, who cares?
[00:55:17.240 --> 00:55:18.600]   I forget about here's the real test.
[00:55:18.600 --> 00:55:19.880]   Do they stop using Google?
[00:55:19.880 --> 00:55:20.240]   Right.
[00:55:20.440 --> 00:55:30.040]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, but the survey said they were going to they
[00:55:30.040 --> 00:55:32.320]   were going to they had planned on this way.
[00:55:32.320 --> 00:55:33.360]   He challenged her.
[00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:34.840]   No, coke is still number one.
[00:55:34.840 --> 00:55:35.320]   Right.
[00:55:35.320 --> 00:55:36.280]   Yeah.
[00:55:36.280 --> 00:55:38.880]   Yeah, that's the Pepsi challenge, isn't it?
[00:55:38.880 --> 00:55:40.320]   No, same idea.
[00:55:40.320 --> 00:55:41.240]   I could tell the difference.
[00:55:41.240 --> 00:55:43.360]   I'm I use you when I drink cola.
[00:55:43.360 --> 00:55:44.000]   Pepsi Coke.
[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:44.840]   Oh, yeah, I can.
[00:55:44.840 --> 00:55:45.680]   Pepsi is sweeter.
[00:55:45.680 --> 00:55:46.200]   It is.
[00:55:46.200 --> 00:55:46.600]   Yeah.
[00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:49.280]   Coke's more has a word of a ting ting
[00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:51.360]   walla walla bing bang.
[00:55:51.360 --> 00:55:53.120]   Google.
[00:55:53.120 --> 00:55:55.080]   You know, it's it's interesting.
[00:55:55.080 --> 00:55:56.920]   Initially, this looks like a victory for Google.
[00:55:56.920 --> 00:55:59.200]   Not so fast.
[00:55:59.200 --> 00:56:03.360]   Federal judge in Delaware on Wednesday dismissed a class action lawsuit over
[00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:05.560]   the Google iPhone thing.
[00:56:05.560 --> 00:56:11.320]   This was Google bypassing Safari on the iPhone setting to block third party
[00:56:11.320 --> 00:56:15.520]   cookies using a trick and in fact, tracking people, even though they had
[00:56:15.720 --> 00:56:17.280]   explicitly said or at least Apple.
[00:56:17.280 --> 00:56:21.000]   So this is where Google's Google's contention was, look, this is a default
[00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:23.800]   setting by Apple not to allow third party cookies.
[00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:26.480]   We don't believe that the user set that.
[00:56:26.480 --> 00:56:28.800]   So we're going to ignore it.
[00:56:28.800 --> 00:56:33.720]   Class action lawsuit, the judge says you can't prove any harm.
[00:56:33.720 --> 00:56:36.200]   So I can't find in your favor.
[00:56:36.200 --> 00:56:39.800]   The judge did not say this is harmless.
[00:56:39.800 --> 00:56:42.000]   This is OK.
[00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:44.600]   In fact, we have no standing.
[00:56:44.800 --> 00:56:49.280]   It's just, you know, you have to show suffering to get an award.
[00:56:49.280 --> 00:56:54.280]   Judge Sue Robinson wrote the companies had a circumvented browser
[00:56:54.280 --> 00:56:58.840]   settings, allowing a user's personal information to be sold to ad companies.
[00:56:58.840 --> 00:57:01.560]   But the judge said the plaintiffs
[00:57:01.560 --> 00:57:06.920]   could not show they suffered because companies collected and sold their
[00:57:06.920 --> 00:57:09.080]   information.
[00:57:09.080 --> 00:57:12.040]   Well, that is important, though, because
[00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:16.800]   we try to run the law on I don't like that or on creepiness.
[00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:19.120]   When in fact, it's actual harm.
[00:57:19.120 --> 00:57:20.520]   What's the actual harm?
[00:57:20.520 --> 00:57:21.720]   Provable harm. Yeah.
[00:57:21.720 --> 00:57:26.240]   Never thought. Well, but the judge admits that the judge said, yeah, you tricked
[00:57:26.240 --> 00:57:28.120]   the browser. You ignored a setting.
[00:57:28.120 --> 00:57:30.400]   It's just that there's no harm against that.
[00:57:30.400 --> 00:57:33.680]   There's no law against against going around a setting.
[00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:34.560]   Good God. We all do.
[00:57:34.560 --> 00:57:35.880]   But listen to what Google said.
[00:57:35.880 --> 00:57:38.640]   A Google spokesperson said the companies pleased the decision, quote,
[00:57:38.640 --> 00:57:42.160]   protecting the privacy and security of our users is one of our top
[00:57:42.160 --> 00:57:45.960]   priorities. But that's not what the decision had anything to do with.
[00:57:45.960 --> 00:57:50.200]   The decision said you did not, in fact, protect the privacy and security of your
[00:57:50.200 --> 00:57:54.040]   users. It just there was no harm, so no foul.
[00:57:54.040 --> 00:57:55.640]   But you didn't, in fact, do that.
[00:57:55.640 --> 00:57:59.760]   They ignored privacy settings and went around it.
[00:57:59.760 --> 00:58:02.520]   It's just there was no damage done.
[00:58:02.520 --> 00:58:04.960]   And I think there I think you could say there is damage done, but it's
[00:58:04.960 --> 00:58:06.960]   diminumous. It's not like it's hard to demonstrate.
[00:58:06.960 --> 00:58:08.640]   How much damage is it a dollar?
[00:58:08.640 --> 00:58:12.120]   Is it a penny? Is it $500 or you can't say?
[00:58:12.280 --> 00:58:15.600]   That's why you can't come up with an award in this case.
[00:58:15.600 --> 00:58:18.400]   So I don't know if that's a victory.
[00:58:18.400 --> 00:58:22.680]   I just think you just can't prove that how much damage there was.
[00:58:22.680 --> 00:58:28.840]   OK. OK. OK. OK.
[00:58:28.840 --> 00:58:30.680]   Yeah.
[00:58:30.680 --> 00:58:32.960]   I don't know. I mean, I don't know about you guys.
[00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:35.800]   I get so it's I get court case and burnout sometimes.
[00:58:35.800 --> 00:58:37.000]   I know.
[00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:40.400]   It's like reading this guy's feeling this guy.
[00:58:40.600 --> 00:58:45.600]   Here's what. Remember, we talked in July about Google saying you cannot have a home
[00:58:45.600 --> 00:58:48.440]   server if you have Google fiber.
[00:58:48.440 --> 00:58:49.640]   Yes.
[00:58:49.640 --> 00:58:51.520]   Well, they reversed it.
[00:58:51.520 --> 00:58:53.280]   Good for them. Yeah.
[00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:56.120]   It took a while. Yeah. Good for them.
[00:58:56.120 --> 00:58:59.480]   And that's not the case.
[00:58:59.480 --> 00:59:01.160]   I don't think with any cable company I know.
[00:59:01.160 --> 00:59:05.760]   No, the acceptable use policy used to ban any type of server.
[00:59:05.760 --> 00:59:09.520]   The new term say Google fiber customers are not allowed to operate servers for
[00:59:09.720 --> 00:59:11.080]   commercial purposes.
[00:59:11.080 --> 00:59:16.080]   However, personal non commercial use of servers that complies with this
[00:59:16.080 --> 00:59:20.120]   except for use policy is acceptable, including using virtual private networks
[00:59:20.120 --> 00:59:23.480]   to access services in your home and using hardware applications that include
[00:59:23.480 --> 00:59:26.840]   server capabilities for users like multiplayer gaming, video conferencing and
[00:59:26.840 --> 00:59:28.720]   home security.
[00:59:28.720 --> 00:59:32.800]   So you still can't run a web commercial web server.
[00:59:32.800 --> 00:59:36.320]   Right. So I couldn't run my crowdfunding campaign on on this network
[00:59:36.320 --> 00:59:39.120]   because that would be considered commercial commercial use.
[00:59:39.320 --> 00:59:42.080]   I feel like that's how an acceptable line, right?
[00:59:42.080 --> 00:59:43.080]   Absolutely use.
[00:59:43.080 --> 00:59:45.880]   Well, that was the big complaint was, hey, people run servers all the time.
[00:59:45.880 --> 00:59:49.560]   If you play game, if you have video games, you're running a server.
[00:59:49.560 --> 00:59:50.040]   Yeah.
[00:59:50.040 --> 00:59:51.960]   Internet of things, it's going to be a little crazy.
[00:59:51.960 --> 00:59:54.920]   I wonder how many people are aware of that, though.
[00:59:54.920 --> 00:59:57.560]   You think everybody, I mean, there are obviously people running servers out of
[00:59:57.560 --> 00:59:59.880]   their house for commercial purposes, right?
[00:59:59.880 --> 01:00:00.840]   Yeah.
[01:00:00.840 --> 01:00:05.360]   I wonder how many people are actually aware that that that's illegal or at least
[01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:07.600]   think it's in the back against the terms of their
[01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:08.800]   rules. Yeah.
[01:00:08.800 --> 01:00:11.400]   It's against against the terms of the static IP.
[01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:13.600]   So you can't really use it.
[01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:15.920]   Don't you? I'm sure you get a static IP.
[01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:16.480]   Really?
[01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:18.920]   Well, maybe not when you do not guarantee the static.
[01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:20.360]   You're not guaranteed.
[01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:22.520]   But there's ways around that there's dying DNS.
[01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:22.960]   Right.
[01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:25.160]   People use dynamic DNS to get around that.
[01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:25.720]   That's true.
[01:00:25.720 --> 01:00:29.520]   I mean, I remember when I first started with, you know, trying to run something
[01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:34.000]   on the internet a long time ago, I ordered a DSL line that was separate from
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.840]   my internet connection because of this very thing.
[01:00:37.040 --> 01:00:39.760]   I thought that had you wanted to dedicated IP address.
[01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:42.600]   I wanted the traffic to be separate.
[01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:45.840]   So I mean, it's in your best interest to do that anyway for security, if nothing
[01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:46.240]   else.
[01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:48.120]   But I mean, it doesn't seem to be a big deal.
[01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:50.440]   It doesn't seem like anybody's going after people who are running commercials,
[01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:54.040]   things out of their house because I think logistically you you if you're
[01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:57.840]   successful, you exceed the bandwidth limitations that you have anyway, you need
[01:00:57.840 --> 01:00:58.720]   something more.
[01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:00.760]   But I don't know.
[01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:03.920]   It just seems seems interesting to me that probably most people have no idea that
[01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:09.880]   there's a clause in their agreement with their cable company or internet provider.
[01:01:09.880 --> 01:01:13.000]   So this must be from
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:14.800]   from you, Jeff Jarvis.
[01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:16.000]   Is the Google Maps one?
[01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.840]   No, the gracious Bill Gross.
[01:01:17.840 --> 01:01:19.000]   Oh, well, I just put that up.
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:19.440]   Yeah, it was.
[01:01:19.440 --> 01:01:23.440]   I thought it was just interesting that it was the history of the Google ad model.
[01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:29.000]   And it's a little bit long to go into, but but Bill and Bill's a friend of mine.
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:30.000]   Bill's one on the show.
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:31.040]   He's a wonderful guy.
[01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:32.320]   Is it great, great guy?
[01:01:32.520 --> 01:01:35.120]   He's I'm not seeing him today because I'm seeing you guys.
[01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:36.240]   He's happy New York.
[01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:37.000]   We're going to get together.
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:40.160]   But so shows what my priorities are.
[01:01:40.160 --> 01:01:41.680]   Thank you.
[01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:46.560]   And but it talks about how
[01:01:46.560 --> 01:01:47.920]   I'm going to forget the name of the company.
[01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:48.480]   Help me out here.
[01:01:48.480 --> 01:01:49.920]   Go to.com.
[01:01:49.920 --> 01:01:52.360]   Go to was really the original model.
[01:01:52.360 --> 01:02:00.440]   And there was a suit and it didn't involve some considerable reward to go to
[01:02:00.440 --> 01:02:01.280]   after a soul.
[01:02:01.480 --> 01:02:03.920]   But what is this still around?
[01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:05.640]   No, that's going to be like yellow.
[01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:07.520]   Like everything yahoo buys.
[01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:08.920]   No, no, it was it was over.
[01:02:08.920 --> 01:02:11.240]   They became overture and who bought over.
[01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:16.760]   Bill Gross started in February 1998, seven months before Google launched.
[01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:22.120]   We didn't like go to at the time because they search results had ads mixed in.
[01:02:22.120 --> 01:02:25.320]   So you get paid search results in effect.
[01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:28.480]   But it was it was the view and
[01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:32.240]   gross somewhere in here says that you know, aren't you upset about this?
[01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:34.720]   And gross says, quote, it says not really says gross.
[01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:36.120]   We didn't patent the idea.
[01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:36.520]   Right.
[01:02:36.520 --> 01:02:38.840]   So if we don't patent it, they can copy it.
[01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:41.960]   Gross is convinced the concept of cost per click auction based search
[01:02:41.960 --> 01:02:44.640]   advertising system would have been patentable in retrospect.
[01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:47.480]   But by the time he thought to do it, though, it was too late.
[01:02:47.480 --> 01:02:50.200]   I would guess Bill Gross has left.
[01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:54.440]   I would guess Bill Gross has left a lot of money on the table in his many years
[01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:56.040]   as an innovator.
[01:02:56.040 --> 01:02:58.640]   Yeah, he's a tremendous innovator.
[01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:03.320]   Now, the way he did it was kind of reprehensible because basically you you
[01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:06.640]   would buy an ad, but instead of play an ad placement on the side, it would be in
[01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:07.920]   the search results.
[01:03:07.920 --> 01:03:08.160]   Right.
[01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:12.840]   He said, well, this will help with spam because people paid for it.
[01:03:12.840 --> 01:03:14.320]   We'll go to the top.
[01:03:14.320 --> 01:03:15.120]   I'm not sure that's right.
[01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:17.760]   I looked I looked at Bill over my glasses at the time.
[01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:21.920]   You know, but it was it was a visionary thing.
[01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:25.160]   And he was on the beginning of his he offered his.
[01:03:25.360 --> 01:03:28.480]   So, you know, the great thing is at the end of the story, it says,
[01:03:28.480 --> 01:03:31.480]   Gross for his part seems comfortable, even happy with how things turned out.
[01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:33.200]   He has nothing but raves for Google.
[01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:35.760]   I'm wildly proud of coming up with a paid search model.
[01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:39.160]   He told me I don't I didn't know how big it was going to be.
[01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:42.560]   It was at the time, you know, and that's that's what struck me as pretty darn
[01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:45.400]   gracious, says I wish I had come up with a Google idea.
[01:03:45.400 --> 01:03:48.360]   The Google idea was the idea for organizing the world's information.
[01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:50.560]   Mine was just an idea for making money.
[01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:52.560]   That was a nice touch of Bill.
[01:03:52.560 --> 01:03:52.960]   Yeah.
[01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:57.760]   And to gracious and to Larry and Sergey's credit, they did they thought the mixing
[01:03:57.760 --> 01:03:59.360]   the results in was reprehensible.
[01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:01.160]   They would yes, they didn't want to do that.
[01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:05.760]   They they talked about partnering with overture, but they they didn't want to do
[01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:08.760]   it because they didn't want to mix it in together and they thought they could do
[01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:12.640]   their own thing and which they did, of course, with and also that advantage for
[01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:13.360]   them, right?
[01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:15.240]   It said, you know, we're not evil.
[01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:17.760]   This is what we're going to do instead and thus be better.
[01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:19.160]   Is it not the case?
[01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:24.960]   It seems to me that that was the original or not evil was that we will not mix
[01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:27.960]   ad results in ads in with our search results.
[01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:28.760]   Yes, I think so.
[01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:30.360]   That was the whole thing.
[01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:37.040]   Well, it was engineers who were giving up a conference room for an ad sales
[01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:41.200]   meeting is that isn't that the city origin story of Don't Be Evil and before
[01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:43.040]   they left the room, Jeff, you probably know this.
[01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:45.560]   They wrote Don't Be Evil on the whiteboard.
[01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:49.760]   I think that that rings a bell.
[01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:50.560]   That sounds right.
[01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:54.560]   Maybe it was from in the plex, but I feel like that was that's my understanding.
[01:04:54.560 --> 01:04:55.360]   The origin story.
[01:04:55.360 --> 01:04:55.760]   Yeah.
[01:04:55.760 --> 01:04:56.960]   Hey, you sales people.
[01:04:56.960 --> 01:04:58.160]   Don't be evil.
[01:04:58.160 --> 01:04:59.360]   Don't be evil.
[01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:03.360]   I'm going to put that on our whiteboard.
[01:05:03.360 --> 01:05:04.560]   I like it.
[01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:07.160]   Yeah, according to Wikipedia, you are correct.
[01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:07.760]   Yeah.
[01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:08.960]   That's a great story.
[01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:10.760]   That that's a great story.
[01:05:10.760 --> 01:05:11.760]   Don't be evil.
[01:05:11.760 --> 01:05:12.560]   Make a choice.
[01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:13.760]   It was institutionalized.
[01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:14.360]   Yeah.
[01:05:16.360 --> 01:05:19.760]   First look inside Google's futuristic quantum lab.
[01:05:19.760 --> 01:05:23.360]   This from the Verge.
[01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:32.360]   And there's a short film, I guess, that debuted at the Imagine Science Films Festival
[01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:34.960]   that shows some of the we can play a little bit of this.
[01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:41.160]   That shows some of the research projects, including computing an absolute zero
[01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:44.360]   or near absolute zero quantum architectures.
[01:05:44.560 --> 01:05:47.160]   There's a colder than space.
[01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:48.960]   Wow, that's kind of cool.
[01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:50.160]   Quantum chips.
[01:05:50.160 --> 01:05:57.960]   The de-wave processor, which uses a behavior that links particles with no apparent
[01:05:57.960 --> 01:05:58.960]   physical connection.
[01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:02.760]   Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:10.760]   And they say the first practical application has been on Google Glass.
[01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:16.160]   Engineers use the quantum chips to work on Glass's blink detector,
[01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:22.760]   helping it to better distinguish between intentional winks and involuntary blinks.
[01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:25.960]   Obviously the glass does not have a quantum processor in it.
[01:06:25.960 --> 01:06:28.160]   But they...
[01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:30.360]   What was so cold?
[01:06:30.360 --> 01:06:36.160]   But the better blink detecting detecting algorithm came from quantum processors.
[01:06:36.160 --> 01:06:36.960]   That's interesting.
[01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:38.160]   Wow.
[01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:39.360]   Wow.
[01:06:39.560 --> 01:06:42.560]   So it's not used itself in the process, but it makes the...
[01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:43.560]   It creates an algorithm.
[01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:44.560]   It makes the algorithm better.
[01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:45.360]   Right.
[01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:46.360]   Yeah.
[01:06:46.360 --> 01:06:47.560]   Together will not be capable.
[01:06:47.560 --> 01:06:48.560]   It's also beautiful.
[01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:49.760]   Coming up with the best...
[01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:50.560]   That's just the...
[01:06:50.560 --> 01:06:51.760]   Those are the shots of the day.
[01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:54.360]   You can see those with problems as they get larger.
[01:06:54.360 --> 01:06:56.560]   So now what is an optimization problem?
[01:06:56.560 --> 01:06:57.560]   Give an example.
[01:06:57.560 --> 01:07:01.760]   You want to do a trip through South America and you want to visit a number of cities.
[01:07:01.760 --> 01:07:04.160]   And then you ask, what is the cheapest ticket?
[01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:06.360]   I think world should have this accent.
[01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:07.560]   Whatever this accent.
[01:07:07.760 --> 01:07:10.360]   And of course different routes and different...
[01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:11.960]   I thought it was Sebastian first.
[01:07:11.960 --> 01:07:14.160]   It sounds like Einstein.
[01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:17.960]   All the different options I have from different routes to travel to the cities.
[01:07:17.960 --> 01:07:19.560]   We currently have a civilization.
[01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:21.760]   We generate vast amounts of data.
[01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:24.760]   It could be climate data, genomic data.
[01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:30.760]   But it's very difficult to generate useful insights off times from that data.
[01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:35.760]   If you can solve optimization problems better, you have an important resource.
[01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:36.960]   I love that.
[01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:40.960]   So the blink, I guess, is that got the problem?
[01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:43.960]   There's an optimization problem.
[01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:47.960]   I think it's a very cool...
[01:07:47.960 --> 01:07:49.960]   Very, very cool.
[01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:50.960]   Very cool.
[01:07:50.960 --> 01:07:51.960]   Extremely cool.
[01:07:51.960 --> 01:07:52.960]   Yeah.
[01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:54.960]   It's cooler than space.
[01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:55.960]   It's colder than space.
[01:07:55.960 --> 01:07:56.960]   Both of them are in space.
[01:07:56.960 --> 01:07:58.960]   I am cooler than space.
[01:07:58.960 --> 01:08:00.960]   Yeah.
[01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:04.960]   Now you may be wondering, Leah, when are you going to get to the Google change log?
[01:08:05.160 --> 01:08:09.160]   But there is no change log today for the first time ever.
[01:08:09.160 --> 01:08:11.160]   Yeah, I just...
[01:08:11.160 --> 01:08:13.160]   There just isn't enough to fill a segment.
[01:08:13.160 --> 01:08:14.160]   Sorry, guys.
[01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:16.160]   There just haven't been a lot of releases this past week.
[01:08:16.160 --> 01:08:18.160]   Everything's the same.
[01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:19.360]   Everyone?
[01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:22.160]   We changed our privacy policy.
[01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:24.160]   Now we can't do any more.
[01:08:24.160 --> 01:08:27.160]   It's all because of the federal government shutdown.
[01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:31.160]   Changes because, like, you know, like the ad thing that we discussed.
[01:08:31.360 --> 01:08:36.360]   And, yeah, just sort of regular pushes, you know, of other apps.
[01:08:36.360 --> 01:08:39.360]   But none of the Google apps have had any significant changes this week.
[01:08:39.360 --> 01:08:40.760]   So, I don't know. Correct me if I'm wrong.
[01:08:40.760 --> 01:08:42.960]   I didn't plot it either.
[01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:46.360]   Did I trip through my subscriptions and didn't see anything?
[01:08:46.360 --> 01:08:47.560]   So, next week.
[01:08:47.560 --> 01:08:49.760]   Are we more changes next week?
[01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:54.960]   Well, we could take a break and come back with our tool and tip and number.
[01:08:54.960 --> 01:08:58.160]   And Aaron, whatever Aaron wants to do, if you would like.
[01:08:58.160 --> 01:09:00.960]   Or do you have any other stories that we have not yet?
[01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:02.160]   Covered.
[01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:03.960]   Did you want to mention?
[01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:06.760]   Can you talk about the last one under other, Leo?
[01:09:06.760 --> 01:09:07.960]   Yes, I can.
[01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:09.160]   That's what I was asking. I was wondering.
[01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:10.360]   Do you like that one?
[01:09:10.360 --> 01:09:11.160]   I love that.
[01:09:11.160 --> 01:09:12.960]   The last one under other.
[01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:14.760]   Let me scroll down.
[01:09:14.760 --> 01:09:17.960]   Yeah, I can talk about this.
[01:09:17.960 --> 01:09:21.160]   I actually donated money to this when they were raising money.
[01:09:21.160 --> 01:09:26.960]   So, there is a company that is trying to sue podcasters.
[01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:28.360]   They haven't sued us, but they've sued.
[01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:33.560]   I think the major networks, ABC, NBC, CBS discovery, they've sued Adam Corolla.
[01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:43.560]   They've sued a bunch of different podcasts saying we have a patent on podcasting of all things.
[01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:46.560]   And you better give us money or you're in trouble.
[01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:55.560]   So, the Electronic Frontier Foundation has the Mark Cuban chair to end stupid patents.
[01:09:55.560 --> 01:09:56.360]   Is that it?
[01:09:56.360 --> 01:09:57.560]   Something like that.
[01:09:57.760 --> 01:10:04.160]   And so, they've been very active in this patent troll issue and they've decided there are a number of ways you can fight a patent troll.
[01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:06.960]   The obvious way is to fight them in court.
[01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:09.360]   You know, they sue you or you sue them.
[01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:13.560]   In fact, a couple of companies have sued them proactively saying we're going to sue you
[01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:19.560]   trying to get the venue in New York instead of in Texas where the patent troll is trying to get these suits.
[01:10:19.560 --> 01:10:21.360]   So, you go to court.
[01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:22.760]   Often, it's a jury trial.
[01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:34.960]   If you get that far, a jury of people in this case in East Texas and they like to do it there because they've had a lot of success in East Texas, both of the judges and the juries will decide.
[01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:42.160]   And this company's already won in other cases against Apple, not the same patent and won quite a bit of money.
[01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:47.960]   The other way to fight it is to go to the patent office and say, "Hey, we want to overturn this patent.
[01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:48.960]   We don't think this is a good patent."
[01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:53.160]   The EFF has decided to file with the patent office.
[01:10:53.160 --> 01:10:57.160]   So, there's not that there's anyone there to get the challenge.
[01:10:57.160 --> 01:11:00.760]   Yeah, yeah, nothing will happen right now, but I guess we're going back to work in that couple of days.
[01:11:00.760 --> 01:11:04.560]   So, they filed a formal challenge to the patent.
[01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:06.760]   I could read you the patent.
[01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:09.760]   They call it an inter-partase review.
[01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:10.960]   It takes a while.
[01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:18.960]   For a while, the EFF was asking, there's a website, I can't remember the name of it, is where you can go and give examples of prior information.
[01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:21.960]   It's a prior art in an effort to help this process.
[01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:22.960]   There it is.
[01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:28.960]   So, if you see the prior art link there, chat, if it were under Help Save podcast, it's Ask Patents, that's it.
[01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:34.960]   So, a number of people contributed there saying, "Hey, there was prior art here, lots of..."
[01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:37.960]   You know, I don't know how helpful any of that was.
[01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:43.160]   I don't know if there was a perfect example, but there were quite a few examples there.
[01:11:43.160 --> 01:11:47.960]   The prior art has to predate the patent that the patent troll is invoking,
[01:11:48.160 --> 01:11:51.160]   which I think is a 1995 or 1996 patent.
[01:11:51.160 --> 01:12:01.760]   In any event, apparently the EFF believes that it has enough material now to successfully appeal to the US Patent and Trademark Office to overturn this.
[01:12:01.760 --> 01:12:05.560]   That could be very good news if they succeed because if...
[01:12:05.560 --> 01:12:07.760]   Now, this could take 18 months, by the way, year and a half.
[01:12:07.760 --> 01:12:12.560]   But if the USPTO overturns it, all the whole thing just goes away.
[01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:17.560]   And of course, you know the technology these people were working on.
[01:12:17.760 --> 01:12:20.760]   When they filed this patent, right?
[01:12:20.760 --> 01:12:26.160]   It was audible magazines on cassette, not even digital.
[01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:32.560]   So they were sending out cassettes to people reading the magazine and that's what this patent is for.
[01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:39.160]   And it was a system for disseminating media content representing episodes in a serialized sequence.
[01:12:39.160 --> 01:12:43.760]   And there's a particular clause that they're basing the lawsuits on.
[01:12:43.960 --> 01:12:48.960]   You know, I can go on and on. I know a little more about this and I care to.
[01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:59.960]   The clause, if you want to read it, is clause 31, apparatus for disseminating a series of episodes represented by media files via the Internet as set episodes become available.
[01:12:59.960 --> 01:13:03.960]   Which sounds a little bit like podcasting, you know, and this is the problem.
[01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:10.960]   You fight, you can fight this and you can even say no, this is an obvious, this is trivial, but a jury is going to sit and look at this and go, well,
[01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:21.160]   golly, there you know, there you are, CBS big company sitting on some poor guy who invented this thing, you know, 20 years ago and you're not giving them a penny and they can easily find against you.
[01:13:21.160 --> 01:13:26.160]   So it's a complicated thing fighting in a court costs millions of dollars.
[01:13:26.160 --> 01:13:32.760]   It's much less expensive if you can win by filing a patent inter partes.
[01:13:32.760 --> 01:13:36.760]   On the other hand, there are risks to doing that.
[01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:43.960]   Every strategy has its risks if the patent office says, nope, we reviewed it and it's a good patent that makes it much harder to win a court.
[01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:49.560]   So while I'm thrilled the EFF did this, you know, I have mixed feelings about it.
[01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:52.760]   If they lose, that's really bad news.
[01:13:52.760 --> 01:13:53.760]   Yeah.
[01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:54.760]   Right.
[01:13:54.760 --> 01:13:59.960]   So I would highly recommend for people that are interested in this topic to go out to this American life.
[01:13:59.960 --> 01:14:01.160]   They did their second episode.
[01:14:01.160 --> 01:14:05.360]   The second episode, they started covering this patent right here that we're talking about and they have some interviews and some of the other things that we're talking about.
[01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:08.360]   And they have some interviews and some details about it.
[01:14:08.360 --> 01:14:10.760]   You know, I won't go into the whole thing because it's wonderful to listen to.
[01:14:10.760 --> 01:14:12.960]   I just listened to it last night in the car on the way home.
[01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:15.240]   So listen to both of them.
[01:14:15.240 --> 01:14:22.440]   I mean, the second one covers pretty much everything in the first one plus some resolution of some patent cases that they were actually investigating.
[01:14:22.440 --> 01:14:26.960]   So I think it's when patents attack, I believe, is what it's called.
[01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:28.360]   And that's on this American life.
[01:14:28.360 --> 01:14:30.160]   Just search for download it, listen to it.
[01:14:30.160 --> 01:14:34.960]   You'll be up in arms after you listen to that show.
[01:14:35.160 --> 01:14:39.360]   Because of what patents are doing to innovation in this country and others.
[01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:40.360]   Yeah.
[01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:40.960]   So huge.
[01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:47.360]   It's a huge sink episode 441 from last July when patents attack.
[01:14:47.360 --> 01:14:48.080]   Oh, no.
[01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:52.560]   Part two is 496, sorry, from May of 2013.
[01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:56.360]   Episode 496, this American life, great show and podcast.
[01:14:56.360 --> 01:15:00.760]   And yeah, I'm sure I don't know.
[01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:04.960]   I don't think they've been mentioned in the lawsuit, but I got to say we're all vulnerable as podcasters.
[01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:06.760]   Yeah, well, they asked them that actually.
[01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:12.360]   This is the only part I'll give away in the in the show as they said, you know, we're doing a podcast right now.
[01:15:12.360 --> 01:15:14.760]   Are you going to sue us?
[01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:17.960]   I said that's false for you.
[01:15:17.960 --> 01:15:20.160]   And I'm sure and I know I know who they were talking to.
[01:15:20.160 --> 01:15:21.760]   And I'm sure he said, well, no, we're not going to sue you.
[01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:23.160]   Right, right.
[01:15:23.160 --> 01:15:25.560]   Yeah, unless.
[01:15:25.560 --> 01:15:26.360]   Yeah.
[01:15:26.360 --> 01:15:28.960]   We decided right now not to pursue that.
[01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:31.560]   And that's what we're just leaving it there.
[01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:40.560]   And that's really that's the real consequence of this kind of trolling is that it isn't big companies riding rough shot over inventors at all.
[01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:41.960]   That's not that at all.
[01:15:41.960 --> 01:15:42.360]   Right.
[01:15:42.360 --> 01:15:44.360]   But that juries don't always see it though.
[01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:47.360]   Do you do?
[01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:47.760]   Okay.
[01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:48.960]   Well, I'm glad you brought that up.
[01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:50.760]   What a downer, Debbie downer.
[01:15:50.760 --> 01:15:52.160]   Sorry about that.
[01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:53.760]   Thanks a lot.
[01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:56.160]   Well, I know it's interesting to everybody listening, right?
[01:15:56.160 --> 01:15:56.760]   I mean, it's yeah.
[01:15:56.760 --> 01:15:58.760]   Well, everybody listens to podcast should be aware of it.
[01:15:58.760 --> 01:15:59.560]   Yeah.
[01:15:59.560 --> 01:16:00.160]   Yeah.
[01:16:00.360 --> 01:16:04.960]   The EFF has quit speaking of EFF.
[01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:11.760]   We talked about this on the security now the global network initiative, a group of tech firms dedicated to opposing internet censorship.
[01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:16.160]   They said that it doesn't have any confidence.
[01:16:16.160 --> 01:16:25.560]   The members of the group, which includes Facebook and Google can really talk about privacy and surveillance given that given the government and prism.
[01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:29.160]   They're afraid that these companies have been.
[01:16:29.160 --> 01:16:33.760]   Have been gagged by the US government.
[01:16:33.760 --> 01:16:38.160]   And so they really this this global network initiative is no longer useful of any kind.
[01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:48.960]   EFF said it can no longer sign its name on joint statements knowing now that GNI's corporate members have been blocked from sharing crucial information about how the government is metaled with these companies security practices.
[01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:52.160]   I don't know.
[01:16:52.160 --> 01:16:55.960]   I don't know if there's evidence, frankly, that Google and Facebook.
[01:16:56.760 --> 01:16:58.960]   No, I think, but I have to be out of the government.
[01:16:58.960 --> 01:17:00.160]   A tactical thing.
[01:17:00.160 --> 01:17:00.560]   Yeah.
[01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:05.560]   To say that to bring attention to the way they are getting.
[01:17:05.560 --> 01:17:12.760]   But I was talking to somebody at a big who used to work with a big communications online company that's put that way.
[01:17:12.760 --> 01:17:23.360]   And about this idea that I've had for some time wondering if there are people with very high security clearance working for you and the managers of the company do not have that much security clearance.
[01:17:24.360 --> 01:17:30.560]   It leads to the presumption that there are things going on in your own company that you don't know that the government is managing your company.
[01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:33.960]   That is a frightening prospect.
[01:17:33.960 --> 01:17:34.760]   Yeah.
[01:17:34.760 --> 01:17:38.960]   And you have security clearance, by the way.
[01:17:38.960 --> 01:17:39.360]   No.
[01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:41.360]   Do you chat?
[01:17:41.360 --> 01:17:41.960]   I should have asked.
[01:17:41.960 --> 01:17:42.360]   No.
[01:17:42.360 --> 01:17:47.160]   I don't give security people to people with red hair.
[01:17:47.160 --> 01:17:48.160]   If I know.
[01:17:48.160 --> 01:17:49.760]   It's definitely.
[01:17:49.760 --> 01:17:52.560]   Yeah, that definitely be an issue for them.
[01:17:53.160 --> 01:17:57.960]   I've had family members who have been dating other people who had security clearance, but that's about it.
[01:17:57.960 --> 01:18:08.160]   It looks like there's a countdown to KitKat going up on the KitKat site.
[01:18:08.160 --> 01:18:08.960]   Plus site.
[01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:10.560]   It's not live.
[01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:17.560]   Android actually viewed the source, looks through the JavaScript and found a reference to a coming soon countdown.
[01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:21.160]   So the coming soon countdown is coming soon.
[01:18:21.760 --> 01:18:26.760]   Oh, so we know from the JavaScript when the coming soon countdown starts, but not when it ends.
[01:18:26.760 --> 01:18:27.760]   We are such much.
[01:18:27.760 --> 01:18:29.160]   Is that what you're saying?
[01:18:29.160 --> 01:18:30.160]   That it's coming.
[01:18:30.160 --> 01:18:32.160]   That the countdown might be coming soon.
[01:18:32.160 --> 01:18:36.160]   The countdown is coming, but we don't know what the countdown is.
[01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:36.560]   Right.
[01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:37.760]   We don't know the countdown.
[01:18:37.760 --> 01:18:39.560]   Coming soon countdown.
[01:18:39.560 --> 01:18:43.960]   Hey, this is the most useless piece of information ever.
[01:18:43.960 --> 01:18:48.360]   And now it's going to spread across 4,000 tech blogs.
[01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:52.560]   They're going to announce a date and then they're going to put a countdown on the site.
[01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:54.160]   So it's not going to happen just out of the blue.
[01:18:54.160 --> 01:18:56.360]   The side at some point will also scroll.
[01:18:56.360 --> 01:18:57.760]   This is a new break.
[01:18:57.760 --> 01:18:58.960]   It has scroll.
[01:18:58.960 --> 01:19:02.560]   And what does this reference to Android gingerbread?
[01:19:02.560 --> 01:19:03.560]   That's making me nervous.
[01:19:03.560 --> 01:19:05.560]   I don't know if I like that.
[01:19:05.560 --> 01:19:07.960]   It's all in there.
[01:19:07.960 --> 01:19:09.560]   It's all in there.
[01:19:09.560 --> 01:19:10.160]   Yeah.
[01:19:10.160 --> 01:19:14.160]   Something soon launched.
[01:19:14.360 --> 01:19:18.160]   Well, what it does mean is we'll know at least 24 hours before.
[01:19:18.160 --> 01:19:18.560]   Right.
[01:19:18.560 --> 01:19:19.160]   Exactly.
[01:19:19.160 --> 01:19:21.360]   In a related.
[01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:23.360]   I want the light things up.
[01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:24.760]   Well, no, I'm not done yet.
[01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:27.560]   In a story related to that, but not exactly the same.
[01:19:27.560 --> 01:19:34.960]   The directors of all the major internet organizations have said we are no longer going to be involved with the United States government.
[01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:38.560]   We're no longer a fiefdom of the Commerce Department.
[01:19:38.560 --> 01:19:42.160]   We are a non non governmental from here on in this includes.
[01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:52.160]   ICANN, the IETF, the Internet Architecture Board, the World Wide Web Consortium, the Internet Society, all five regional internet address registries.
[01:19:52.160 --> 01:20:03.960]   All said they called for accelerating the globalization of ICANN and IANA functions towards an environment in which all stakeholders, including all governments, participate on an equal footing.
[01:20:03.960 --> 01:20:09.360]   We explicitly rejecting the US Commerce Department's unilateral oversight of ICANN.
[01:20:09.560 --> 01:20:19.360]   And this is just huge in the long run because this is how the government truly blew it and this brings this invites in Iran, China and company and Russia.
[01:20:19.360 --> 01:20:22.160]   This is dangerous to the net.
[01:20:22.160 --> 01:20:23.960]   Thank you very frigging much.
[01:20:23.960 --> 01:20:28.360]   NSA and I don't blame them because who can trust the US government.
[01:20:28.360 --> 01:20:29.960]   I don't either.
[01:20:29.960 --> 01:20:33.360]   But this is this affects the future of the Internet.
[01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:35.160]   This affects the business of the Internet.
[01:20:35.160 --> 01:20:38.560]   This affects Americans views of us.
[01:20:38.760 --> 01:20:39.760]   Why?
[01:20:39.760 --> 01:20:41.160]   Square cash has been launched.
[01:20:41.160 --> 01:20:44.760]   You can now send money from square via email.
[01:20:44.760 --> 01:20:46.160]   You could do that with the Google Wall.
[01:20:46.160 --> 01:20:46.960]   There's lots of ways to do that.
[01:20:46.960 --> 01:20:48.160]   Big deal.
[01:20:48.160 --> 01:20:51.560]   I like this one.
[01:20:51.560 --> 01:20:55.360]   Bank robbers alleged bank robbers.
[01:20:55.360 --> 01:20:56.960]   I'm a journalist.
[01:20:56.960 --> 01:20:59.960]   They were charged in Massachusetts with robbing a bank.
[01:20:59.960 --> 01:21:01.160]   Of course, what did they do?
[01:21:01.160 --> 01:21:04.960]   The cops, they went and got the computer and they looked at their history.
[01:21:05.160 --> 01:21:11.160]   And apparently they were searching for things like.
[01:21:11.160 --> 01:21:12.360]   Let's see.
[01:21:12.360 --> 01:21:13.560]   How do you find a problem?
[01:21:13.560 --> 01:21:16.960]   What happens if you rob a bank?
[01:21:16.960 --> 01:21:24.560]   Also, what happens if you rob a house and what happens if you rob a drug dealer?
[01:21:24.560 --> 01:21:29.760]   Apparently, the least risky is robbing the bank.
[01:21:33.560 --> 01:21:36.560]   By the way, unarmed robbery, not robbed.
[01:21:36.560 --> 01:21:40.560]   I probably one of those things where they put the finger in the pocket.
[01:21:40.560 --> 01:21:44.360]   Getaway driver is also being held on $25,000 bail.
[01:21:44.360 --> 01:21:50.960]   Who probably had Google Maps, you know, labeled as getaway from bank.
[01:21:50.960 --> 01:21:54.560]   How do I, what's the fastest route away from the bank searches for?
[01:21:54.560 --> 01:21:57.160]   What happens if you rob a bank?
[01:21:57.160 --> 01:22:00.360]   I mean, even a bank robber, I don't why.
[01:22:00.360 --> 01:22:01.560]   What happens if we find a sort of a bank?
[01:22:01.560 --> 01:22:02.760]   Wait a minute, we got to do it.
[01:22:02.960 --> 01:22:04.560]   What happens?
[01:22:04.560 --> 01:22:06.360]   Leo, if you rob a bank, that's it.
[01:22:06.360 --> 01:22:10.160]   Well, I better not rob a bank.
[01:22:10.160 --> 01:22:13.560]   Of course, that story number one.
[01:22:13.560 --> 01:22:14.760]   In fact, we can know long.
[01:22:14.760 --> 01:22:18.760]   OK, here's 10 potentially catastrophic mistakes made during bank robberies.
[01:22:18.760 --> 01:22:20.160]   This is good. This is useful.
[01:22:20.160 --> 01:22:21.960]   OK.
[01:22:21.960 --> 01:22:26.360]   Wait, gosh, you know, this this story has ruined these search results
[01:22:26.360 --> 01:22:29.960]   because they're the rest of the search results of these guys.
[01:22:30.160 --> 01:22:33.560]   Thanks, guys, for ruining it for the rest of us.
[01:22:33.560 --> 01:22:35.560]   Now, I don't know what happens if you rob a bank.
[01:22:35.560 --> 01:22:36.760]   No, what does happen?
[01:22:36.760 --> 01:22:38.160]   What does happen?
[01:22:38.160 --> 01:22:39.160]   We'll never know now.
[01:22:39.160 --> 01:22:42.360]   We'll just see that stupid story.
[01:22:42.360 --> 01:22:46.160]   Google may be doing a watch.
[01:22:46.160 --> 01:22:50.360]   I had the Google, the Galaxy gear was better than I thought.
[01:22:50.360 --> 01:22:51.760]   You know, everybody was really slamming it.
[01:22:51.760 --> 01:22:53.160]   It's the best of the watches out there.
[01:22:53.160 --> 01:22:54.560]   It's going to build a camera.
[01:22:54.560 --> 01:22:57.360]   It can you can run any Android app apparently.
[01:22:57.560 --> 01:23:03.360]   So now the rumors are Google is doing a watch functionality of Google.
[01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:06.360]   Now, of course, would be front and center as it is.
[01:23:06.360 --> 01:23:10.760]   You know, I would guess in any wearable device.
[01:23:10.760 --> 01:23:13.960]   Apparently Google will announce and this is the rumor.
[01:23:13.960 --> 01:23:19.360]   A Nexus watch code named Jim when it announces KitKat.
[01:23:19.360 --> 01:23:24.160]   More to countdown to you can get a watch that counts down to county now to get.
[01:23:24.160 --> 01:23:25.360]   Maybe that's the countdown.
[01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:27.360]   It's a special countdown watch.
[01:23:27.360 --> 01:23:28.560]   Google did buy whim.
[01:23:28.560 --> 01:23:32.160]   Remember that was one of the early early players in the smart watches.
[01:23:32.160 --> 01:23:34.160]   It was Android based.
[01:23:34.160 --> 01:23:36.360]   My theory is that since it's October 31st,
[01:23:36.360 --> 01:23:41.160]   they're going to give a bunch of these out to Google employees in KitKat wrappers.
[01:23:41.160 --> 01:23:44.360]   Oh, then give them out, you know, for Halloween for trick or treat like.
[01:23:44.360 --> 01:23:46.560]   Oh, that's a nice costume you have there.
[01:23:46.560 --> 01:23:47.760]   Have this special.
[01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:48.960]   Have this watch.
[01:23:48.960 --> 01:23:49.360]   Candy.
[01:23:49.360 --> 01:23:51.560]   Have some candy, dandy.
[01:23:51.560 --> 01:23:52.160]   All right.
[01:23:52.160 --> 01:23:56.160]   Now we will take a break now that we've got the robbers in the watch in.
[01:23:56.360 --> 01:23:57.960]   I can now safely move on.
[01:23:57.960 --> 01:24:01.560]   Are you brought to you by every downer?
[01:24:01.560 --> 01:24:04.960]   Yeah, no, I got we've distanced ourselves, I think, sufficiently.
[01:24:04.960 --> 01:24:05.760]   Yes.
[01:24:05.760 --> 01:24:06.760]   The depression.
[01:24:06.760 --> 01:24:07.560]   Sorry about that.
[01:24:07.560 --> 01:24:11.360]   The lawsuits and non-governmental organizations.

[01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:44.160]   Really interesting.
[01:25:44.160 --> 01:25:46.760]   I'm going to find which episode that was.

[01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:55.160]   Jerry, you all know Jerry.
[01:25:55.160 --> 01:25:57.360]   Of course, she's a great maker.
[01:25:57.360 --> 01:26:00.760]   Worked for a while at Steam.
[01:26:00.760 --> 01:26:04.760]   Left Steam to work on something very exciting,
[01:26:04.760 --> 01:26:07.560]   which she's going to show us.
[01:26:07.560 --> 01:26:10.160]   Virtual reality glasses.
[01:26:10.160 --> 01:26:11.360]   And it's cool.
[01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:12.360]   Did you play with it?
[01:26:12.360 --> 01:26:13.360]   I got to try them.
[01:26:13.360 --> 01:26:14.560]   It's awesome.
[01:26:14.560 --> 01:26:16.760]   Castar, CastAR.
[01:26:16.760 --> 01:26:19.560]   They funded, by the way.
[01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:21.160]   So that's really good news.
[01:26:21.160 --> 01:26:25.560]   She has raised $418,720.
[01:26:25.560 --> 01:26:27.760]   And they still have 30 days to go.
[01:26:27.760 --> 01:26:30.960]   On, isn't this cool?
[01:26:30.960 --> 01:26:32.160]   Good for our.
[01:26:32.160 --> 01:26:32.960]   Yeah.
[01:26:32.960 --> 01:26:36.360]   So we're going to get our first look at CastAR
[01:26:36.360 --> 01:26:40.160]   in just a little bit with Jerry Ellsworth on triangulation.
[01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:44.360]   Time now though, for our tip, our number, our tool of the week.
[01:26:44.360 --> 01:26:45.760]   And anything Aaron wants to throw in.
[01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:49.360]   Let's start with Gina Trepani in her tip of the week.
[01:26:49.560 --> 01:26:52.360]   New Google search trick.
[01:26:52.360 --> 01:26:54.960]   Find out what your tip should be.
[01:26:54.960 --> 01:26:57.560]   Now on a bill.
[01:26:57.560 --> 01:26:58.560]   Seriously.
[01:26:58.560 --> 01:27:00.760]   Oh, you mean that kind of tip.
[01:27:00.760 --> 01:27:02.360]   This is a tip tip.
[01:27:02.360 --> 01:27:03.760]   No, no, no, it's a tip tip.
[01:27:03.760 --> 01:27:04.160]   Yeah.
[01:27:04.160 --> 01:27:05.760]   So you go to go to go to Google search
[01:27:05.760 --> 01:27:09.560]   and you type in what is the tip for $37.
[01:27:09.560 --> 01:27:09.960]   I love it.
[01:27:09.960 --> 01:27:14.160]   And Google will return for $37 bill.
[01:27:14.160 --> 01:27:18.360]   What the 15 what the tip should be if you want to tip at 15% in this case,
[01:27:18.560 --> 01:27:20.160]   it would be 40.
[01:27:20.160 --> 01:27:22.560]   What 37 plays this right?
[01:27:22.560 --> 01:27:24.760]   Yeah, 15% would be five.
[01:27:24.760 --> 01:27:28.560]   It gives you all that you can change the percentages and the splits to look at that.
[01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:29.960]   Yeah, you can change percentages.
[01:27:29.960 --> 01:27:34.040]   You can say, hey, what about 20% split between two people and I'll tell you the tip
[01:27:34.040 --> 01:27:39.160]   per person and the total per person really, really, really give 15% isn't that kind
[01:27:39.160 --> 01:27:40.160]   of low?
[01:27:40.160 --> 01:27:41.040]   I think so.
[01:27:41.040 --> 01:27:42.160]   I would have made the default 20.
[01:27:42.160 --> 01:27:43.960]   But yeah, I would.
[01:27:43.960 --> 01:27:46.160]   I'm in the Midwest and then you can split it.
[01:27:46.360 --> 01:27:49.760]   So if there's three people at the bill, each of you can throw in your eight,
[01:27:49.760 --> 01:27:51.560]   nine, eight, eight, nine.
[01:27:51.560 --> 01:27:53.560]   This is actually splits the bill too.
[01:27:53.560 --> 01:27:54.160]   That's nice.
[01:27:54.160 --> 01:27:55.560]   Yeah, it splits the bill.
[01:27:55.560 --> 01:27:56.760]   It tells you the tip per person.
[01:27:56.760 --> 01:27:58.480]   So really handy if you don't have a
[01:27:58.480 --> 01:28:01.360]   calculator installed on your phone, you can just I'm sure you could just say this
[01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:03.560]   in the Google now as well.
[01:28:03.560 --> 01:28:05.360]   And yeah, it's what you're to.
[01:28:05.360 --> 01:28:06.360]   I love it.
[01:28:06.360 --> 01:28:09.960]   And if you really want to stiff somebody and go down to 10 percent.
[01:28:09.960 --> 01:28:11.360]   Yeah, there you go.
[01:28:11.360 --> 01:28:12.360]   9 percent.
[01:28:12.360 --> 01:28:13.160]   There's a good wall.
[01:28:13.160 --> 01:28:14.360]   Yeah, I don't want to go.
[01:28:14.560 --> 01:28:16.360]   Hello, can you go?
[01:28:16.360 --> 01:28:18.160]   It goes zero zero percent.
[01:28:18.160 --> 01:28:19.360]   Well, we know that's zero.
[01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:21.360]   That one I could figure out.
[01:28:21.360 --> 01:28:24.360]   That's what we say is that is such an engineering thing to do.
[01:28:24.360 --> 01:28:26.160]   Why would you ever have zero percent?
[01:28:26.160 --> 01:28:27.760]   Don't you love Google though?
[01:28:27.760 --> 01:28:28.560]   That is awesome.
[01:28:28.560 --> 01:28:33.360]   I guess that's if you if you need to split split an amount, you know, without a tip.
[01:28:33.360 --> 01:28:34.160]   Yes, that's true.
[01:28:34.160 --> 01:28:35.160]   I guess that makes sense.
[01:28:35.160 --> 01:28:36.160]   That's true.
[01:28:36.160 --> 01:28:39.960]   Yeah, because a lot of them you don't care because they if you have more than six people,
[01:28:39.960 --> 01:28:41.760]   they've already included the tip.
[01:28:41.760 --> 01:28:42.160]   Right.
[01:28:42.160 --> 01:28:43.560]   So you just put it in the total right.
[01:28:43.760 --> 01:28:44.960]   Split it six ways.
[01:28:44.960 --> 01:28:46.360]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:28:46.360 --> 01:28:46.960]   That's right.
[01:28:46.960 --> 01:28:48.160]   Good point.
[01:28:48.160 --> 01:28:50.560]   So yeah, tip calculator built right into Google start.
[01:28:50.560 --> 01:28:54.760]   Oh, Jeff Jarvis, your number of the week.
[01:28:54.760 --> 01:28:57.160]   Well, I can tell it's getting dark earlier here because I'm.
[01:28:57.160 --> 01:28:57.960]   Yeah, look at that.
[01:28:57.960 --> 01:28:59.360]   She's sitting in the dark.
[01:28:59.360 --> 01:29:03.760]   So Chad, at the bottom of the Google, there's a video that I'm this video, I think it was kind of neat.
[01:29:03.760 --> 01:29:10.360]   So the number of the week is 26, an amazing story that Google's telling of Saru Munshi Khan,
[01:29:10.560 --> 01:29:16.760]   who when he was five years old fell asleep on a train in India with his 14 year old brother.
[01:29:16.760 --> 01:29:23.160]   And so then he woke up 1500 kilometers away in Calcutta.
[01:29:23.160 --> 01:29:25.160]   I mean, no way to get home.
[01:29:25.160 --> 01:29:25.960]   Nothing at all.
[01:29:25.960 --> 01:29:28.960]   He gets adopted by a family in Tasmania.
[01:29:28.960 --> 01:29:29.560]   What?
[01:29:29.560 --> 01:29:32.160]   He does not know where his home was.
[01:29:32.160 --> 01:29:33.160]   He's five years old.
[01:29:33.160 --> 01:29:37.560]   He doesn't have the details, but then he uses get ready for the goosebumps.
[01:29:37.560 --> 01:29:40.360]   Google maps to track back.
[01:29:40.360 --> 01:29:41.760]   And find his home.
[01:29:41.760 --> 01:29:45.760]   And the end of the video is him in a reunion with his mother back home.
[01:29:45.760 --> 01:29:46.360]   Oh, my God.
[01:29:46.360 --> 01:29:48.560]   It's just friggin amazing.
[01:29:48.560 --> 01:29:49.360]   Wow.
[01:29:49.360 --> 01:29:52.960]   I don't think we're going to play the whole thing, but it's a it's a wonderful tale.
[01:29:52.960 --> 01:29:57.360]   26 years later, going back home with an Australian accent.
[01:29:57.360 --> 01:29:59.560]   Wow.
[01:29:59.560 --> 01:30:01.160]   Now we I don't see the link.
[01:30:01.160 --> 01:30:02.360]   So where's the link, Jeff?
[01:30:02.360 --> 01:30:04.360]   You put some other numbers in there.
[01:30:04.360 --> 01:30:06.960]   There's not a video there.
[01:30:06.960 --> 01:30:08.360]   Well, yeah, it's at the next.
[01:30:08.560 --> 01:30:09.560]   To the bottom of the top.
[01:30:09.560 --> 01:30:11.560]   It's a bottom of the Google bottom of the Google section.
[01:30:11.560 --> 01:30:11.960]   Right.
[01:30:11.960 --> 01:30:15.160]   Oh, it's the bottom of the Google section.
[01:30:15.160 --> 01:30:17.160]   So the number is 26.
[01:30:17.160 --> 01:30:19.760]   Yeah, I just decided to go back up.
[01:30:19.760 --> 01:30:20.760]   Rescue that.
[01:30:20.760 --> 01:30:24.160]   After falling asleep, that is such a strange.
[01:30:24.160 --> 01:30:26.160]   The whole thing is strange.
[01:30:26.160 --> 01:30:29.360]   He falls asleep on a train and he never gets back home.
[01:30:29.360 --> 01:30:30.360]   I don't play the whole thing.
[01:30:30.360 --> 01:30:32.960]   I don't have any tissues.
[01:30:32.960 --> 01:30:33.760]   Oh, my God.
[01:30:33.760 --> 01:30:34.760]   This killer.
[01:30:34.760 --> 01:30:35.360]   I know.
[01:30:35.560 --> 01:30:39.960]   We're trying to get up. My brother just said, I'll stay here and I'll come back.
[01:30:39.960 --> 01:30:43.960]   And I just thought, well, you know, I must just go to sleep and just wake me up.
[01:30:43.960 --> 01:30:48.360]   And when I wake up the next day, the whole carriage was empty on a runaway train.
[01:30:48.360 --> 01:30:49.760]   A ghost train taking me.
[01:30:49.760 --> 01:30:51.160]   I don't know where.
[01:30:51.160 --> 01:30:52.960]   Oh, my God.
[01:30:52.960 --> 01:30:54.360]   But a black hole of help.
[01:30:54.360 --> 01:30:58.160]   To Australia, to an Australian family.
[01:30:58.160 --> 01:31:03.160]   And Mum had decorated my room with the map of India, which she put next to my bedside.
[01:31:03.360 --> 01:31:09.360]   I wake up every morning seeing that map and hence it sort of kept the memories alive.
[01:31:09.360 --> 01:31:10.560]   I'm confused.
[01:31:10.560 --> 01:31:14.560]   So you're trying to find the needle in a haystack so you never find it.
[01:31:14.560 --> 01:31:20.960]   I'd have flashes of the places that I used to go, the flashes of my family faces.
[01:31:20.960 --> 01:31:26.760]   There was the image of my mother sitting down with her legs crossed, just watching her cry.
[01:31:26.760 --> 01:31:28.960]   Life is just so hard.
[01:31:28.960 --> 01:31:31.960]   That was my treasure.
[01:31:32.560 --> 01:31:35.560]   And I was looking at Google Map, realized there's Google Earth as well.
[01:31:35.560 --> 01:31:42.560]   In the world we could zoom into, I started to have all these thoughts in what possibilities that this could do for me.
[01:31:42.560 --> 01:31:49.560]   I said to myself, you know, you've got all the photographic memories and landmarks where you're from and you know where the town looks like.
[01:31:49.560 --> 01:31:54.160]   This could be an application that you could use to find your way back.
[01:31:54.160 --> 01:32:01.960]   I thought I'd put a dot on Calcutta train station in a radius line that, you know, you should be searching around this area.
[01:32:02.160 --> 01:32:13.160]   I sort of came across these train tracks and I started following it and I came to a train station which reflected the same image that was in my memories.
[01:32:13.160 --> 01:32:23.160]   Everything matched. I just thought, "Yeah, I know where I'm going. I'm just going to let the map that I have in my head to lead me and take me back down my hometown."
[01:32:23.160 --> 01:32:27.360]   I came to the doorstep of the house that I was born.
[01:32:27.560 --> 01:32:34.560]   I walked around about 15 metres around the corner. There was three ladies standing outside adjacent to each other.
[01:32:34.560 --> 01:32:38.760]   And the middle one stepped forward and I just thought, "This is your mother."
[01:32:38.760 --> 01:32:45.560]   She came forward, she hugged me and, you know, we were there for about five minutes.
[01:32:45.560 --> 01:32:51.560]   She grabbed my hand and she took me to the house and got on the phone.
[01:32:51.560 --> 01:32:55.560]   She rang my sister and my brother to say that, you know...
[01:32:55.760 --> 01:32:59.760]   You put your brother to your last little son appeared like a 26-year-old.
[01:32:59.760 --> 01:33:01.960]   We found him.
[01:33:01.960 --> 01:33:04.160]   There you are.
[01:33:04.160 --> 01:33:08.360]   Everything's all good. They help my mother out. She doesn't have to be sliding like a 15-year-old.
[01:33:08.360 --> 01:33:10.560]   I told you I'd get him back, Ma.
[01:33:10.560 --> 01:33:13.560]   We're the middle of the high stack.
[01:33:13.560 --> 01:33:15.760]   The needle was there. Everything's there.
[01:33:15.760 --> 01:33:20.560]   Yeah, if Jimmy Kimmel shows up later in this video, I'm...
[01:33:21.760 --> 01:33:25.760]   You know, it is too good. You're right. That's a good boy.
[01:33:25.760 --> 01:33:29.760]   It's a touch far-fetched.
[01:33:29.760 --> 01:33:32.760]   But okay.
[01:33:32.760 --> 01:33:37.960]   He's got a book. I mean, there's more to it. He's written a book about this long way home.
[01:33:37.960 --> 01:33:41.760]   Did Google pay for this thing or...?
[01:33:41.760 --> 01:33:43.760]   I would imagine they produced it.
[01:33:43.760 --> 01:33:44.760]   Well, they pay for the ad, right?
[01:33:44.760 --> 01:33:47.760]   And it's an interesting story.
[01:33:47.760 --> 01:33:48.960]   Wow.
[01:33:48.960 --> 01:33:51.560]   His mother is Jimmy Kimmel. That's it.
[01:33:51.560 --> 01:33:54.560]   Aaron, why don't you do a big brother Jimmy Kimmel?
[01:33:54.560 --> 01:33:56.760]   Why don't you do your tip?
[01:33:56.760 --> 01:34:00.360]   All right. So this week on that note, boy, that's right to follow.
[01:34:00.360 --> 01:34:02.560]   Wow. Yeah.
[01:34:02.560 --> 01:34:05.760]   Take that number.
[01:34:05.760 --> 01:34:10.360]   Yeah, thanks. Thanks for that, Jeff Jarvis.
[01:34:10.360 --> 01:34:14.360]   So I've got an app actually this week and it's called Focal.
[01:34:14.360 --> 01:34:20.560]   And there's been a few of these apps that have come out of the cyanogen mod going public thing
[01:34:20.760 --> 01:34:24.960]   where people have taken the cyanogen mod, developers that were helping with cyanogen mod
[01:34:24.960 --> 01:34:27.760]   and maybe had a piece of that have taken what they were working on
[01:34:27.760 --> 01:34:30.760]   and actually put it on Google Play on the Google Play Store.
[01:34:30.760 --> 01:34:33.960]   For people just to download on any phone they want, they don't have to download cyanogen mod.
[01:34:33.960 --> 01:34:35.560]   So one of these is called Focal.
[01:34:35.560 --> 01:34:37.560]   And it's in beta right now. It's not perfect.
[01:34:37.560 --> 01:34:39.760]   It doesn't work every time. Just a heads up.
[01:34:39.760 --> 01:34:42.160]   But what it does do is pretty cool.
[01:34:42.160 --> 01:34:47.360]   So Focal actually gives you the opportunity to do things like the panorama,
[01:34:47.560 --> 01:34:51.560]   Google panorama mode or the photosphere mode and all that kind of stuff.
[01:34:51.560 --> 01:34:56.960]   If you don't have Google edition on your phone, you can just get this app.
[01:34:56.960 --> 01:34:59.760]   It does a pretty good job of emulating all the features.
[01:34:59.760 --> 01:35:01.360]   There we go. Here it is.
[01:35:01.360 --> 01:35:05.360]   So it does a pretty good job of emulating all the features that you would get in the Google,
[01:35:05.360 --> 01:35:06.560]   but with more too.
[01:35:06.560 --> 01:35:08.560]   There's a there's a ton of features in here.
[01:35:08.560 --> 01:35:11.360]   So you can do things like they have an HDR mode.
[01:35:11.360 --> 01:35:13.560]   They have different scenes for night mode.
[01:35:13.760 --> 01:35:16.560]   Just click on it. It'll give you all the scenes over here.
[01:35:16.560 --> 01:35:21.360]   Sunset mode, things like that party mode, a bunch of different effects that you can do.
[01:35:21.360 --> 01:35:23.960]   Seepia black and white.
[01:35:23.960 --> 01:35:26.160]   You can adjust the ISO.
[01:35:26.160 --> 01:35:30.560]   You can do things like burst mode if you're if the the app that you have on your phone
[01:35:30.560 --> 01:35:32.360]   doesn't support burst mode.
[01:35:32.360 --> 01:35:36.560]   You can use this to do burst, which I was doing earlier with I as timer mode,
[01:35:36.560 --> 01:35:37.160]   things like that.
[01:35:37.160 --> 01:35:39.160]   So there's all kinds of cool things that you can do with it.
[01:35:39.160 --> 01:35:42.560]   Also, it's got some advanced advanced focusing features.
[01:35:42.760 --> 01:35:44.960]   I don't know if I don't know if we can do this live.
[01:35:44.960 --> 01:35:47.960]   We'll see if the camera can pick it up, but you can click anywhere on the screen
[01:35:47.960 --> 01:35:52.760]   and it'll focus on that particular place so that the focus doesn't have to be in the middle.
[01:35:52.760 --> 01:35:53.760]   You can move it around.
[01:35:53.760 --> 01:35:55.560]   I can focus on my laptop.
[01:35:55.560 --> 01:35:57.760]   I can focus.
[01:35:57.760 --> 01:35:58.760]   Whoops, come on.
[01:35:58.760 --> 01:35:59.960]   I can focus over here.
[01:35:59.960 --> 01:36:00.960]   I can focus over here.
[01:36:00.960 --> 01:36:04.360]   You just touch it focuses wherever you're pointing and then you can take a picture.
[01:36:04.360 --> 01:36:08.360]   The other really cool thing that it does too is it gives you a preview that's separate
[01:36:08.360 --> 01:36:09.560]   from the preview.
[01:36:09.560 --> 01:36:12.160]   Oh, look, I took a picture of my laptop just then.
[01:36:12.360 --> 01:36:14.680]   It gives you a quick preview of some different things.
[01:36:14.680 --> 01:36:16.560]   There's I as checking something out that he got.
[01:36:16.560 --> 01:36:17.760]   This is the burst mode.
[01:36:17.760 --> 01:36:18.760]   There's a bunch of these.
[01:36:18.760 --> 01:36:22.360]   And then if you don't like one, if you don't like a photo, you just swipe down to delete it.
[01:36:22.360 --> 01:36:26.760]   So it's really easy to use and a really basic camera with a lot of features.
[01:36:26.760 --> 01:36:30.960]   So and again, it was put out by this guy who was doing this for Sanajamod.
[01:36:30.960 --> 01:36:35.360]   And for whatever reason, couldn't have this app in the.
[01:36:35.360 --> 01:36:37.560]   The public version of Sanajamod, I guess.
[01:36:37.560 --> 01:36:41.360]   And so he decided, hey, I'll just put this over the fence as an app in the play store.
[01:36:41.560 --> 01:36:48.560]   The other really cool thing about this guy is they are starting a new mod and it's called
[01:36:48.560 --> 01:36:51.760]   Omni Mod and I would highly recommend people go check this out.
[01:36:51.760 --> 01:36:52.560]   It's an Omni.
[01:36:52.560 --> 01:36:53.560]   I'm sorry, Omni ROM.
[01:36:53.560 --> 01:36:58.160]   It's an Omni ROM dot org and what they're doing with Omni ROM is they're kind of picking up.
[01:36:58.160 --> 01:37:02.960]   I would say where Sanajamod left off, it's everything on here is entirely open source
[01:37:02.960 --> 01:37:05.360]   and it's also being used as a learning tool.
[01:37:05.360 --> 01:37:10.360]   If you're into modding your phone or you want to take open source version from Android
[01:37:10.560 --> 01:37:15.560]   source version and mod it and make your own mod to run on your phone, they're actually
[01:37:15.560 --> 01:37:16.760]   giving you the tools to do that.
[01:37:16.760 --> 01:37:17.960]   So they're putting up the source code.
[01:37:17.960 --> 01:37:19.960]   They're putting up tutorials.
[01:37:19.960 --> 01:37:22.760]   They're helping people get involved in the Android ecosystem.
[01:37:22.760 --> 01:37:27.360]   Kind of what I would say the same way that Sanajamod did when they first got started.
[01:37:27.360 --> 01:37:31.560]   So if you're into open source and you're into Android, I would highly recommend checking
[01:37:31.560 --> 01:37:36.960]   out omni-rom.org and those are the same people that put up this application called
[01:37:37.160 --> 01:37:41.160]   Googles. So it's really cool. It's free to download and if you want to donate,
[01:37:41.160 --> 01:37:42.160]   there's a donate option.
[01:37:42.160 --> 01:37:45.360]   You can buy a different version of the app that's $2.99, but it's not a pro version or
[01:37:45.360 --> 01:37:45.560]   anything.
[01:37:45.560 --> 01:37:48.760]   It's just a way for people to donate and support the app.
[01:37:48.760 --> 01:37:49.560]   So there you go.
[01:37:49.560 --> 01:37:50.360]   Very cool.
[01:37:50.360 --> 01:37:50.760]   Vocal.
[01:37:50.760 --> 01:37:51.360]   Check it out.
[01:37:51.360 --> 01:37:52.360]   Thanks to the chat room.
[01:37:52.360 --> 01:37:55.360]   They pointed out that any dues beta is now public.
[01:37:55.360 --> 01:38:00.160]   If you are the calendar version of any do, if you're an any do user and I apologize,
[01:38:00.160 --> 01:38:02.560]   Gina, because I know Gina makes a great to do app for Android.
[01:38:02.560 --> 01:38:07.080]   But any topologist, any dot do is really beautiful and gorgeous and works with
[01:38:07.080 --> 01:38:07.960]   Google calendars.
[01:38:07.960 --> 01:38:12.240]   I use it a lot for task management and they've been kind of saying, oh, we're going
[01:38:12.240 --> 01:38:12.800]   to do a calendar.
[01:38:12.800 --> 01:38:14.680]   We're going to do a calendar.
[01:38:14.680 --> 01:38:16.280]   You can now get it on.
[01:38:16.280 --> 01:38:18.680]   You've been able to get it on iOS, but you can now get it on Android.
[01:38:18.680 --> 01:38:24.880]   But to do this, you have to go to Google plus to the any do super users.
[01:38:24.880 --> 01:38:28.680]   Google plus page and join that community.
[01:38:28.680 --> 01:38:31.880]   So if you show mine, you'd be better off.
[01:38:31.880 --> 01:38:32.560]   There you go.
[01:38:32.560 --> 01:38:34.880]   Join this community and do super users.
[01:38:35.080 --> 01:38:37.280]   It's Google plus any do super users.
[01:38:37.280 --> 01:38:40.880]   And then you'll see in the about this community the ability to check.
[01:38:40.880 --> 01:38:44.080]   Become an any do super user or a Cal super user.
[01:38:44.080 --> 01:38:45.600]   That's what you want.
[01:38:45.600 --> 01:38:50.080]   Once you've done that, it'll say, OK, I see you and then you can join the test.
[01:38:50.080 --> 01:38:52.080]   Then you can download it from the play store.
[01:38:52.080 --> 01:38:55.080]   You have to do this and that's because it's a little buggy.
[01:38:55.080 --> 01:38:55.880]   It's beta.
[01:38:55.880 --> 01:38:58.880]   Yeah, but it is very interesting and very beautiful.
[01:38:58.880 --> 01:39:03.080]   I have to say I've been a fan of any do for a long time because it's a gorgeous
[01:39:03.280 --> 01:39:06.080]   app and I think they've done a very nice job with the calendar app as well.
[01:39:06.080 --> 01:39:09.640]   It's got some unique features to show it over this way because then that way you
[01:39:09.640 --> 01:39:11.880]   don't have to change calendars.
[01:39:11.880 --> 01:39:13.680]   I'll give it to Aaron.
[01:39:13.680 --> 01:39:16.280]   So you could see there's the calendar.
[01:39:16.280 --> 01:39:20.680]   If you swipe that up, you'll see the to do list and the task manager and also
[01:39:20.680 --> 01:39:24.680]   a photo theme and some other interesting features.
[01:39:24.680 --> 01:39:26.280]   It crashes a lot.
[01:39:26.280 --> 01:39:27.880]   It's very buggy.
[01:39:27.880 --> 01:39:31.280]   But if you've been wondering when am I now you're getting a phone call from that
[01:39:31.280 --> 01:39:31.880]   fellow.
[01:39:32.080 --> 01:39:35.280]   If you if you're wondering, yeah, that's his number.
[01:39:35.280 --> 01:39:38.880]   Just case anybody wants to know if you're.
[01:39:38.880 --> 01:39:40.080]   We didn't do it on purpose.
[01:39:40.080 --> 01:39:43.680]   We can't be responsible if you want to know.
[01:39:43.680 --> 01:39:46.800]   You know, if you've been seeing this and want to know how to get it on Android,
[01:39:46.800 --> 01:39:47.400]   that's how you do it.
[01:39:47.400 --> 01:39:49.480]   And this just went public today.
[01:39:49.480 --> 01:39:58.360]   So you join the any do super users group on Google plus any do any dot do,
[01:39:58.360 --> 01:40:01.880]   I guess any dot do slot space.
[01:40:01.880 --> 01:40:06.360]   Super splash users space users and then click that link and you can download it.
[01:40:06.360 --> 01:40:06.760]   Cool.
[01:40:06.760 --> 01:40:07.400]   I know a lot of you.
[01:40:07.400 --> 01:40:08.440]   I've been waiting for a while.
[01:40:08.440 --> 01:40:10.680]   I'm a I'm a big any do fan and I'm just
[01:40:10.680 --> 01:40:12.680]   interested to see what they come up with as a calendar.
[01:40:12.680 --> 01:40:15.560]   And it's very beautiful, very, very gorgeous.
[01:40:15.560 --> 01:40:16.280]   All right.
[01:40:16.280 --> 01:40:17.960]   I think we're we got Aaron.
[01:40:17.960 --> 01:40:18.600]   We got Jeff.
[01:40:18.600 --> 01:40:19.520]   We got to Gina.
[01:40:19.520 --> 01:40:21.000]   I think we're out of time.
[01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:22.600]   Thank you very much for being here.
[01:40:22.600 --> 01:40:28.360]   Don't forget think up.com to contribute to Gina's fund razor for think up and
[01:40:28.360 --> 01:40:30.960]   become a think up user as I am now.
[01:40:31.160 --> 01:40:36.520]   Officially as we all are on the hosted version of this fabulous social media
[01:40:36.520 --> 01:40:37.880]   analytics.
[01:40:37.880 --> 01:40:38.520]   Thank you.
[01:40:38.520 --> 01:40:39.640]   Thank you for being here.
[01:40:39.640 --> 01:40:41.200]   She's at smartherware.org.
[01:40:41.200 --> 01:40:41.840]   That's her blog.
[01:40:41.840 --> 01:40:44.240]   You can also see you're on all about
[01:40:44.240 --> 01:40:48.680]   Android on Tuesdays and in beta on the five by five network.
[01:40:48.680 --> 01:40:50.600]   And of course, every week on this show.
[01:40:50.600 --> 01:40:51.880]   Thanks to Jeff Jarvis.
[01:40:51.880 --> 01:40:53.400]   Yeah. Oh, and yes.
[01:40:53.400 --> 01:40:56.440]   And a little bit a little bit of personal news.
[01:40:56.440 --> 01:40:57.840]   I am going home.
[01:40:57.840 --> 01:40:59.440]   I'm going to be back to New York.
[01:40:59.440 --> 01:40:59.920]   What?
[01:41:00.120 --> 01:41:01.440]   I'm going to talk about it at the end of the year.
[01:41:01.440 --> 01:41:02.240]   Yes.
[01:41:02.240 --> 01:41:03.440]   Yeah.
[01:41:03.440 --> 01:41:05.080]   Going to Brooklyn.
[01:41:05.080 --> 01:41:05.880]   I am.
[01:41:05.880 --> 01:41:07.160]   We got to play some Brooklyn.
[01:41:07.160 --> 01:41:07.800]   I'm very excited.
[01:41:07.800 --> 01:41:10.040]   Probably going to move like a beginning of December.
[01:41:10.040 --> 01:41:11.720]   So end of the year.
[01:41:11.720 --> 01:41:14.520]   She wants to host any great news neighbor.
[01:41:14.520 --> 01:41:16.520]   That's really exciting.
[01:41:16.520 --> 01:41:17.440]   I'm very excited.
[01:41:17.440 --> 01:41:17.640]   Yeah.
[01:41:17.640 --> 01:41:21.160]   You know, Anil and I have an office there in Manhattan and I'm excited to work
[01:41:21.160 --> 01:41:24.920]   with him in person and Edda will be closer to our family.
[01:41:24.920 --> 01:41:27.480]   So you just didn't want to raise Edda in California.
[01:41:27.480 --> 01:41:28.720]   I know.
[01:41:28.720 --> 01:41:29.560]   Yeah.
[01:41:29.760 --> 01:41:31.120]   Oh, my girls got to grow up in Brooklyn.
[01:41:31.120 --> 01:41:34.240]   You didn't want to be a hippie surfer chick.
[01:41:34.240 --> 01:41:38.520]   She got to be a hard bitten suffering Brooklyner.
[01:41:38.520 --> 01:41:39.680]   Exactly.
[01:41:39.680 --> 01:41:40.320]   Exactly.
[01:41:40.320 --> 01:41:41.520]   That's awesome.
[01:41:41.520 --> 01:41:42.880]   Your mom's out there, right?
[01:41:42.880 --> 01:41:43.960]   Your family's out there.
[01:41:43.960 --> 01:41:45.080]   Yeah, my family is there.
[01:41:45.080 --> 01:41:49.400]   All of that is cousins and my siblings and my mom and my wife's family are also
[01:41:49.400 --> 01:41:51.600]   on the East Coast on the East Coast.
[01:41:51.600 --> 01:41:52.640]   So it just makes a lot of sense.
[01:41:52.640 --> 01:41:53.520]   We need babysitters.
[01:41:53.520 --> 01:41:54.480]   So that's right.
[01:41:54.480 --> 01:41:55.560]   That is important.
[01:41:55.560 --> 01:41:56.560]   That's huge.
[01:41:56.560 --> 01:41:56.800]   Yeah.
[01:41:56.800 --> 01:41:58.400]   It's like number one.
[01:41:58.600 --> 01:41:59.600]   Absolutely.
[01:41:59.600 --> 01:42:00.320]   I'm delighted.
[01:42:00.320 --> 01:42:01.720]   Do you know, lunch is on me?
[01:42:01.720 --> 01:42:02.560]   Awesome.
[01:42:02.560 --> 01:42:04.000]   I'm so excited, Jeff.
[01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:06.400]   I'm really excited and I'm really honestly excited to be in the New York
[01:42:06.400 --> 01:42:07.120]   startup community.
[01:42:07.120 --> 01:42:08.400]   I think it's like, yes, it's like,
[01:42:08.400 --> 01:42:09.360]   the place to start a company.
[01:42:09.360 --> 01:42:13.200]   I'm very excited that our office is going to be in New York and I just,
[01:42:13.200 --> 01:42:16.120]   it's been hard for me being here and seeing what's going on in New York and
[01:42:16.120 --> 01:42:17.000]   not being able to participate.
[01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.960]   So I'm glad it's going to be a homecoming for me.
[01:42:19.960 --> 01:42:22.200]   Well, I'm about to announce that we're going to move the entire
[01:42:22.200 --> 01:42:24.000]   Twitter operation to Brooklyn next week.
[01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:25.200]   So that's exciting.
[01:42:25.200 --> 01:42:26.200]   Perfect.
[01:42:26.200 --> 01:42:27.000]   Perfect.
[01:42:27.200 --> 01:42:28.720]   Chipotle on me.
[01:42:28.720 --> 01:42:29.720]   For a poll.
[01:42:29.720 --> 01:42:30.600]   I mean, pizza.
[01:42:30.600 --> 01:42:31.560]   Are you kidding?
[01:42:31.560 --> 01:42:32.520]   You moved to Brooklyn.
[01:42:32.520 --> 01:42:33.480]   Don't eat Chipotle.
[01:42:33.480 --> 01:42:35.000]   What are you crazy?
[01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:35.840]   Pizza.
[01:42:35.840 --> 01:42:38.480]   Everybody meatballs.
[01:42:38.480 --> 01:42:39.120]   White Castle.
[01:42:39.120 --> 01:42:39.440]   Whoops.
[01:42:39.440 --> 01:42:40.920]   Well, no, I'll take some white castles.
[01:42:40.920 --> 01:42:41.600]   You like my cousin?
[01:42:41.600 --> 01:42:42.320]   Why not?
[01:42:42.320 --> 01:42:43.920]   Oh, I'm a man.
[01:42:43.920 --> 01:42:44.560]   Oh, really?
[01:42:44.560 --> 01:42:47.160]   Jeff Jarvis is at the city university in New York.
[01:42:47.160 --> 01:42:48.320]   His book is public parts.
[01:42:48.320 --> 01:42:50.240]   He blogs at Buzzmachine.com.
[01:42:50.240 --> 01:42:51.120]   Where are you going next?
[01:42:51.120 --> 01:42:52.520]   You're going to Davos.
[01:42:52.520 --> 01:42:53.440]   Is that soon?
[01:42:53.440 --> 01:42:54.200]   You're around.
[01:42:54.200 --> 01:42:54.760]   It's January.
[01:42:54.760 --> 01:42:55.480]   It's January.
[01:42:55.480 --> 01:42:56.440]   I'm around for a bit.
[01:42:56.640 --> 01:42:58.960]   Yeah, there's nothing like Switzerland in January, I think.
[01:42:58.960 --> 01:43:00.000]   Yeah, so smart of me.
[01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:00.640]   I don't ski.
[01:43:00.640 --> 01:43:05.680]   Aaron, noom, anything you want to plug my friend?
[01:43:05.680 --> 01:43:08.680]   Not barrel jumping, but you can follow me on Google+.
[01:43:08.680 --> 01:43:10.600]   It's the best place to have a conversation with me.
[01:43:10.600 --> 01:43:11.720]   I often chat back to fans.
[01:43:11.720 --> 01:43:14.480]   They say, oh, we love seeing you on such and such a program.
[01:43:14.480 --> 01:43:18.440]   Since I do a variety of them here on the Twit Network and I'm happy to engage.
[01:43:18.440 --> 01:43:21.280]   Because we have really interesting conversations on Google+.
[01:43:21.280 --> 01:43:24.080]   But you can also follow me on Facebook and Twitter as well.
[01:43:24.080 --> 01:43:25.080]   So pick your poison.
[01:43:25.080 --> 01:43:25.680]   There you go.
[01:43:25.880 --> 01:43:27.160]   Yep, great to have you.
