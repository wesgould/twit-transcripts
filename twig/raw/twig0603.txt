[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.680]   It's time for Twig this week in Google Jeff Jarvis's year.
[00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:07.520]   Aunt Pruitt is here, Stacey Higginbotham is back lots to talk about,
[00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:12.480]   including the new Google Nest hub, the tractor, sleep using radar.
[00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.840]   We'll take a tour of a bowling alley on a drone that's got Hollywood sitting up and taking notice.
[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:23.920]   And then how the sperm whales fought off the whaling vessels in the 19th century.
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.040]   Yes, that's coming up too. It's all next on Twig.
[00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.040]   This is Twig.
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:48.880]   This week at Google, Episode 603, recorded Wednesday, March 17, 2021.
[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:50.880]   Sleeping with a Mime.

[00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:17.840]   It's time for Twig this week in Google, the show where we get together,
[00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.800]   and just talk about whatever the hell's on our minds.
[00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.840]   It's so wonderful to have Stacey Higginbotham back from staceyoniot.com.
[00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.000]   Oh, she is not named Matthew Ingram. We'll fix that in post.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.640]   We'll fix that in post. I thought I for a minute.
[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:37.680]   I like Matthew.
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.400]   Yeah, I love I thought for a minute maybe you got a new job, but no.
[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:46.160]   She's she's at Stacey on IOT.com does the great IOT podcast with Kevin Tofon.
[00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.200]   Of course, her newsletters are fantastic. There she is.
[00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:56.720]   Hi, Stacey. Looks pretty sunny and bright up there in the Pacific Northeast, Northwest.
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:03.600]   It is it's going to be very sad to stay on Islam. I'm like, oh, it's such a nice day.
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.120]   All right, we'll make this a really short show just for you.
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:12.400]   Daylight savings time is like my friend. It's on my side now.
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:18.080]   Yeah, the light is back. Also, Mr. Jeff Jarvis.
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.760]   Wait a minute. Hey, the Atlantic Tower Professor for
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.040]   giant ladies. They get a nice and at the Craig Newmark
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.880]   Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York. Hello, Jeff.
[00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.120]   Hello. Hello. Hello. Have you had both?
[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.720]   So just see back Stacey. You deserted us.
[00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.480]   We missed Stacey. Have you had both shots, Jeff, or just the first?
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:43.040]   Yes, I have.
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.800]   Okay. I just got my first today.
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:50.640]   I had no reaction the day after my first shot, but I and people might think I'm nuts at this.
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.680]   I had a 13 day delayed reaction. My arm was not sore. It was sore 13 days later.
[00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.160]   Wow. Beaver. I kind of want a reaction because I feel like I'm not.
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.120]   You do because you want to know it works.
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.560]   Yeah. If I'm not having it. If I could maybe they gave me the placebo.
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.800]   Maybe there was some leftover placebo also.
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.960]   No, I want to react because that means my immune system is is saying.
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:11.680]   Exactly.
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.080]   Fight this guy off. Ant Proet is also here. Hands on photography.
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:21.360]   Lots of praise for your most recent episode with the lens rental guy.
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.600]   Mr. Sakala.
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:29.520]   John Sakala. Yeah. Roger. Roger. John. Roger.
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:37.040]   I sir. I I can't Roger. Roger is his name. I knew that.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.040]   Anyway, it's good to have you to that TV slash hands on photography.
[00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:48.240]   I don't know what to start with today.
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:52.800]   What do you think? That's Google. Should we well.
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:04:01.760]   Jinx and there's a whole section here. You're all about Google, but it's all boring.
[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:07.760]   Pretty much is. They announced a new nest hub that will watch you sleeping.
[00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.840]   I'm very curious what you'll think of that. I have many thoughts.
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.960]   I did briefings on it and I'll get a review unit when the time comes.
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:21.680]   To the right. You start. I saw you tweeted tweeted out to the community about this and
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:26.720]   my response as well as a bunch of other folks was isn't this already happening.
[00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.720]   Whether it's through Fitbit or just the other devices that are out there.
[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.960]   That's why I can order it. We can order it March 25th.
[00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.240]   The nice thing about this little nest hub, by the way, there's one right next to me when I'm
[00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.880]   sleeping. It doesn't have a camera, but it does have solely, right?
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:48.000]   And that's how it's going to do the sleep tracking, which is that radar implementation.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.640]   It's going to use two things. It'll use solely and the microphone.
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:57.680]   So it'll measure your. Snores and coughing. And then it uses solely to measure your
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.960]   respiration. Oh, it's not going to analyze all that. It's not going to work.
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.800]   How about your movement? Does it measure that too?
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.400]   So it's measuring the movement of your chest.
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:09.760]   But if you roll around a lot and
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:14.720]   you will calibrate. So when you, and this is important, when you opt in,
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:18.480]   you'll calibrate it by lying on your bed and you'll set it there. It'll be like,
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:21.120]   turn me this way. Turn me that way. All right. Lay here.
[00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:25.920]   And it's a one person to one device thing. So if you're, if you sleep with someone,
[00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:30.480]   it's only going to track you in your chunk of the bed and they get no tracking.
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:35.680]   They say it works via, even when you have a CPAP or if there are animals who sleep on your bed,
[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:43.120]   all kinds of things. So, but it is a good question, which is, why do we need this when we all have
[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:46.400]   800 other ways of monitoring our sleep tracking? You don't have to wear anything.
[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.080]   Right. I do like that. Yeah. You don't have to wear like a Fitbit. You don't have to charge it.
[00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:58.160]   I mean, I have a thing under a score, a paddle. Yeah. It's from SIRDA under my mattress,
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:02.320]   in between my mattress and box spring. And there's two of them, one from me and one from whoever's
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:11.520]   sleeping with me at the time. And that's always my life. And, and... I have a funny story about one
[00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:16.960]   of those, but yeah, go ahead. Yeah. And then it actually, I don't know how it does it because
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:21.040]   it's going through the mattress, but it seems to do very well. And then just kind of keeping
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:25.360]   honest, I wear this Aurora ring, which also does the same thing. I should wear my Apple Watch one
[00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:29.760]   night and see if they all confer. They think of... That would be interesting. Yeah.
[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:35.760]   Yeah. A lot of people don't have... Do you have a sleep score? I think it was sleep score
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:40.880]   for hands-on wellness. And it was just a little device that sat off to the side and it used the
[00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:47.600]   different laser beams firing out. And it seemed pretty consistent when I tested it up with like
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:55.200]   the Wythen Smart... What was it? Wythen Smart Band? Some other smart band. They did have a watch.
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:07:01.760]   Yeah, but they were both pretty consistent on what their readings were. And I find it more
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:06.240]   convenient to not have to wear something at night. Well, that's why I like this Surda. It's...
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:10.480]   When I got it was 60 bucks a day. But not everybody wants to buy a new bed. And Apple bought a
[00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:14.480]   company called Bed at the B.F.A.T. No, this isn't a bed. No, no, no, this wasn't a bed. This is just a
[00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:21.520]   plastic tracker. It was about four inches tall plugged in with the USB-C cable and it just sat
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:25.440]   over there to corner to bed. Just like what Google says they were doing with Nest.
[00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:31.920]   Same technology. Yeah, so this will compete with that. No, he said lasers. Radar and lasers are
[00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:36.160]   different. Well, yeah, radar. Sorry, it's not lasers. Oh, I was like, I'm like, I'm like,
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:45.920]   I'm like, I'm like, get me! Only out the johns sleep some lasers. So what else did they tell you
[00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:52.880]   about this solely based device? It will have thread. And why will it have thread? Because one day we're
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:58.240]   going to learn more about Project Chip, but not today. Thread is its home automation.
[00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:08.720]   Thread is a, yeah, it's a radio protocol for home network or smart home devices. Apple has
[00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:14.400]   thread in the new HomePod mini. You're going to see it in more places. Yeah. And if you've got
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:21.680]   the HomePod minis and the Nanoleaf essential light bulbs, that thread connection, it is so fast.
[00:08:21.680 --> 00:08:26.880]   It is really nice. That's one thing a lot of people complain about. I do. The lag between saying,
[00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:31.600]   hey, hey, slow mo, turn out the lights and the time it actually turns out the lights is a few
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:36.400]   seconds. And I usually hover in the hall because I'm doing this. I got a bed to make sure that they
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:40.320]   get turned off before I go to bed. And I don't like that hovering. I would like to just,
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:45.360]   see, you could turn off the switch and it would just happen. I know. It's a, I not sold on the
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:50.480]   whole home automation thing. I'm sorry, Stacey. I apologize. It's okay. You know, I'm not 100%
[00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:57.520]   sold either. Yeah. Mike has got to do better. Mike has sergeant in the chatroom. He's saying,
[00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:04.320]   Stacy and I always get jazzed about thread. So I have on my bedside table, I have way too many
[00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:08.960]   devices. I have the current nest hub. So I was thinking of replacing it. But then I realized,
[00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:14.080]   but I also have the sleep tracker. I have my ring and I have the AirPod mini there too.
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:19.600]   I'm sure there's some other devices I've forgotten all right by my head. So I'm sure they're also,
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:22.880]   you don't want to keep yourself on it. Oh, the cell funds, they're both of them.
[00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:30.960]   I'm wondering how the ultra wide band in the home pod would react with the radar from solely
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:37.120]   interference. I need to check there with their, what their stuff in there. I'm sure it's not good
[00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:42.240]   for me. Is your, is your bedside table metal? Because I realized my husband's bedside table is
[00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:47.760]   metal. Is that a problem? That's well, yeah, metal and wireless frequencies. Yeah, but he's a
[00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:52.400]   higher up than the table is. It just means that if you were under the table, that wouldn't work.
[00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:58.240]   Well, yes, but it's, you know, like it's just another thing you got to think about.
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:02.240]   Well, I, you know, I'm glad I don't have a metal mattress because otherwise the sleep tracker
[00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:07.120]   wouldn't work either. So actually there probably is metal in the mattress. There's springs, right?
[00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:11.360]   Yeah. Well, I don't know. Is it a temper? Peanut or is it a spring?
[00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:15.440]   No, it's not. It's probably not. If you're on Casper's. Casper has springs, the one way,
[00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:20.000]   I think the one we have has springs. Really? Yeah. Only one of their mattresses.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.600]   It's the mattress for fat boys because
[00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:31.680]   like the other mattresses, like the rubber foam ones, when you get out of bed, you,
[00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:36.320]   the bed gets out of you. It rolls you out because as you get close to the edge, it collapses and you
[00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:42.400]   go, right? Right. So the one we have has an edge so that I can get out of bed. Otherwise,
[00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:45.920]   like they're my back like a turtle.
[00:10:45.920 --> 00:10:51.040]   And he got me out of bed. So that's
[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:54.080]   coming the little box like there other than that. Chris started coming to big box.
[00:10:54.080 --> 00:11:00.000]   Oh, no, it comes in a box. Yeah. Yeah. I think I actually saw a story about this
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:06.400]   of course that used to headline surveillance. Well, it is. It's surveilling your sleeping.
[00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:09.920]   All trackers are surveilling. You're asking it to do it, right? Isn't that his job?
[00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:17.200]   Yeah. It is. Well, so there. Well, okay. No, let's let's talk about this like rational people.
[00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:21.120]   At least it doesn't have a cable. It doesn't have a camera. Although I would say,
[00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:27.840]   I mean, radar does track your motion. So if you think about radar, you could totally tell what
[00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:32.560]   someone's doing. Plus for sleep tracking, it's going to be listening for snoring and things like
[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:38.560]   that. So all the data is processed locally on the device. You have to opt in. There is a visual
[00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:44.640]   indicator when that system is turned on and you can delete things verbally and in the app. So you
[00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:49.280]   can be like, delete the last night's sleep. So those are what that's what Google's done. But what I
[00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:54.560]   will say is say that you should feel comfortable because there's not a camera in there is a little
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:59.360]   bit of a it's not a red herring. What is it? It's just a like a diversion in the sense that
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:06.080]   radar is very could be very effective at telling you exactly what not exactly actually. Yeah,
[00:12:06.080 --> 00:12:09.920]   exactly what you're doing. It's fine. But I think what people are worried about with the camera is
[00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:15.920]   that it's going to see you naked or something. Right now, you can see the outline of you and what
[00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:23.360]   you're doing. Oh, and yeah, never mind. I mean, not that. What are you going to do? I mean,
[00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:26.720]   I don't know what people I don't honestly know why people will worry about a camera in the
[00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:32.160]   bedroom. Well, and again, all that data, just the results are sent to the cloud. All of that data
[00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:37.400]   is processed on the
[00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:44.560]   the like the results. Your REM sleep was this you slept this good. Good. Good. So it's doing it
[00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:47.920]   on the problem. Like a train. It's amazing. They could do this for a hundred bucks. And by the
[00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:52.000]   way, the screen is great. I really like having a nest hub in the bedroom. I can watch you can
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:57.760]   actually I could say because I have YouTube TV, I could say let's watch CNN and it's got a little
[00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:02.720]   screen on my bedside table or watch the ball game when the football games were on. I would have that
[00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:09.360]   going. That's kind of nice and music and I mean, I really like the nest hub. It's kind of amazing
[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:15.840]   what they could do for a hundred bucks. So the fear of the camera, I think, is pictures. Well,
[00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:22.160]   it's it's former New Yorker writer. And so the other the other morning, I was I wait a minute.
[00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:26.320]   What it's former New Yorker writer. What's his name? Who got in trouble for?
[00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:32.800]   Oh, Jeffrey Tubin. Yeah. That wouldn't be so well. But the other day I was I was watching an
[00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:37.920]   Australian academic conference and it was on the zoom and I was in bed because it was Australian
[00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:42.880]   time. So as soon as I woke up, I turned it on, but I was in bed and I was paranoid. Too many
[00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:45.360]   care. I was paranoid. I was paranoid. I was making sure the camera was off. Yeah.
[00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:50.480]   Right. I understand that. I understand that. So it's more about accidents, I think.
[00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:59.440]   Now I'm not crazy about a sleep tracker that uses my noises to my my mouth. As long as it
[00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:04.960]   doesn't play it back to you. Oh, I've been I've been no, no, no, no, no, you're got your
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:14.480]   get your mind out of the gutter. I tape my mouth shut. So I don't I'm giving you a very weird
[00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:21.920]   picture. I'm very weird picture of my bedtime. No, it's wrong time to take a drink of water.
[00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:27.360]   So I read this book. It's a good book. You probably read it Stacey because you're up on all this
[00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:33.280]   stuff called breath right by James Nestor. Have you read that yet? It's all the rage. Everybody's
[00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:37.680]   talking about it. It's how we don't breeze right and mostly you should never breathe through your
[00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:42.480]   mouth. And one of the things you recommend because when you're asleep, you can't your mouth fall.
[00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:48.080]   You breathe through your mouth. One of the things he recommends is you take a little bit of 3M
[00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:54.720]   surgical, micro pore surgical tape and you just put it right here and your mouth closed. And it's
[00:14:54.720 --> 00:15:04.000]   asking to do that certain times on the show during the Facebook segment.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:12.960]   Notice I don't bring up anymore. This is a chilling effect because I don't bring up Facebook on
[00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:18.480]   this show anymore. Your mind is on Facebook. Just don't call me the devil. That's all. That's all.
[00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:23.680]   That's all I ask. Okay. So you tape your mouth shut and you're worried because it sounds weird
[00:15:23.680 --> 00:15:29.040]   when you're. No, there are no sounds anymore. Lisa says it's like there's nobody in bed with
[00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:34.000]   her anymore. She's like sleeping with a mime. I don't know what the hell sounds I was making.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:41.760]   But it silences all that. And you just breathe through the whole point really is that you breathe
[00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:49.280]   through your nose, which usually. So I'm like, even when I'm sleeping, I'm like,
[00:15:49.280 --> 00:15:55.760]   so my mouth is shut. Yeah, I used to have a mouth guard. Oh, you have a guard? I do. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:15:55.760 --> 00:16:01.120]   Mouth bar is good. You can do this with a mouth guard. That way you'll neither grind nor snore.
[00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:02.960]   Exciting.
[00:16:02.960 --> 00:16:08.880]   I'll check it out. I'll try it out. They chat room. This is what you're talking about when you get
[00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:14.880]   old. You got a gaffer's tape will work. No, well, he recommended he said painters tape is okay.
[00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:20.880]   There are people who do it duct tape. I think that's too sticky. He recommends 3M. I have an
[00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:27.120]   extra role. I bought a dozen. I'll bring it in. He recommends 3M micro pore surgical tape.
[00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:32.880]   Did Nestor the guy wrote this book, if you have a red breeze, a breath, it's not bright
[00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:37.440]   breeze. It's breath. If you have not read breath, I was just saying if you have a beard or a mustache,
[00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:41.200]   well, don't do it. You don't have to do this. That's not the whole point of the book.
[00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:44.960]   My problem is by CPAP. Yeah. Because the CPAP is a little more.
[00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:50.080]   This will work with the CPAP by the way, Jeff. Oh, it will. The Google thing. Yeah. Oh, I see it
[00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:54.800]   breath. The new science of a lost art. It's a very good book. I highly recommend it, Stacey.
[00:16:54.800 --> 00:17:00.560]   It's enjoyable. It's fun. And you'll learn how to breathe properly, which apparently we don't
[00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:06.800]   know how to do. We breathe through our mouths. It's because we eat too much soft food nowadays.
[00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:14.800]   Did you know this from the book that ancient skulls, perfect teeth,
[00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:21.120]   perfect sinuses, they don't have any of the issues, mouth,
[00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:25.040]   tooth-crowding or anything because of the diet they think.
[00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:31.280]   But now in the modern soft food diet, because we all need orthodontia.
[00:17:31.280 --> 00:17:36.560]   Oh my God. Soft foods. What are they talking about? I ate a salad last night. It took me like
[00:17:36.560 --> 00:17:41.600]   30 minutes. Compared with what the crow magnum is. A salad is.
[00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:44.800]   Rining rocks. Yeah. They're not on bones.
[00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:52.560]   Like bison legs. This course is delicious. They may have died at the age of 30,
[00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:57.440]   but they had perfect teeth. That's the difference. I don't think I got a question for you.
[00:17:57.440 --> 00:18:02.480]   Yes. Good. This device sense cardiac arrest.
[00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:13.360]   Theoretically, if you stopped breathing, yes. It's not tracking your heart rate.
[00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:19.360]   But again, all of this, you train it. This is just the radar. If you trained it to look for
[00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:24.800]   cardiac arrest, maybe. But I don't know. We've got to be interested in the whole wall for nigh.
[00:18:24.800 --> 00:18:26.080]   At least not advertising this for sids or anything.
[00:18:26.080 --> 00:18:32.000]   Well, that's interesting too. If we call on to 911, it probably wouldn't come in time.
[00:18:33.840 --> 00:18:37.600]   Right. That's the thing. I also don't think you want an automated device that says he's not
[00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:42.480]   breathing and calls 911. Well, I'd rather that. I mean, I guess.
[00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:50.080]   What if it just did a siren to wake you up? This is, I mean, I have devices. I mean, we all have
[00:18:50.080 --> 00:18:53.760]   devices. We wear it a bit. I wear this ring to bed. It would know if my heart stopped.
[00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:57.200]   But I don't think that they've said it. I know they haven't set it up. Why not?
[00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:02.000]   I'm a little longer. Why not? I don't know. Oh, because they have to because you have to be
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:07.120]   really sure. Yeah, you know, you don't want false heart attack alarms that really.
[00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:14.240]   Yeah, not good. I wear if you're in the weird pulse oximeter every night to you. All right. So
[00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:20.560]   you know where your blood oxygen is. Mm hmm. Yeah. Because you think I mean, are you worried about
[00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:24.720]   your blood oxygen level? Or are you? I wanted. Well, yeah. If you're if you're on a CPAP, yes.
[00:19:24.720 --> 00:19:31.760]   Okay. No, I don't know. I wanted to track it. I wanted the data to track. You should read
[00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:37.840]   the book. I think you'd enjoy this book as well, Jeff. I noticed that you told Stacy to stay healthy
[00:19:37.840 --> 00:19:41.840]   and read the book, but you didn't tell. No, no, you would love it. Well, I figured you listen.
[00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:47.680]   This blurb is hilarious. If you breathe, you need this book. So there you go. Okay. Anybody here
[00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:53.360]   not breathing? That's how you mark it. That's really good. I like it. That was our first line for
[00:19:53.360 --> 00:20:00.240]   Epicurious for people who eat. Yeah, there you go. Yeah. Hey, Epicurious is not Bonapétit.
[00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:06.800]   Is it is? It was both Bonapétit and and gourmet. I was there at the start of it. So you're
[00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:15.280]   are you following this whole reply all? Not lately. No, so so fill us in boss. Yeah, it was a big story
[00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:22.720]   in the Sunday times reply all, which is a it's a technology podcast from Gimlin Media, except it's
[00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:27.600]   really more about they call it a podcast about the internet sort of, but it's really more about
[00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:34.400]   it's a lifestyle thing. But they were doing an expose on the racism and sexism, but mostly racism
[00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:41.840]   at Epicurious bonus or is it Bonap? Well, Bonap, it was because it was all male
[00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:48.160]   white male editors and by bylined writers, but all the people doing all the cooking and the hard work
[00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:55.520]   were people of color. And and they were there's a hilarious video of a woman who everybody asked
[00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:59.200]   every question of and they never give her any credit and didn't pay her well. Yeah.
[00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:04.960]   So that was a bit of a scandal. So reply all is planning a four part
[00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:13.120]   expose of this. It didn't make it to the third part. And the two people who were running it got
[00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:19.440]   left apparently. And it's it's there was a so if you listen to the most recent reply all,
[00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:26.560]   there's no show he just says, Hey, I gotta apologize. We've decided not to continue the test kitchen
[00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:33.600]   series we're doing because as it turned out, Shruti Piddememini, who was the host and PJ Vote,
[00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:43.120]   who was her editor, it triggered a reckoning of their own. But it you know, it was unclear exactly
[00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:50.320]   what was was going on. But on Twitter, there was some threads apparently,
[00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:56.800]   Miss Piddememini and Mr. Vote had contributed to a toxic dynamic at Gimlet.
[00:21:56.800 --> 00:22:04.640]   Weirdly, they've both been critical of uni-ization efforts. Like, I think that's allowed. I think
[00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:09.840]   that's a kind of a like legally legally a free speech thing. You don't have to be pro union.
[00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:16.160]   Many people of color felt it was their last chance of creating an environment within
[00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:21.600]   Gimlet where they could succeed. It's one of those things where it looked like they were being honest
[00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:26.240]   and forthright. But all it did was it was very unclear and muddy. And I thought maybe Jeff,
[00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:31.200]   because it's a media story more than anything else. It's like layers of an onion.
[00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:36.400]   Yeah. I followed the bone app closely, but I didn't follow the reply all.
[00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:40.640]   Yeah. And of course, I'm I follow it because I'm, you know, very aware of Gimlet, which is,
[00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:45.760]   you know, very successful podcast network. Alex Blumberg was it this American life and
[00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:47.520]   created Planet Money.
[00:22:47.520 --> 00:22:55.680]   Somebody said in a recent interview, this all stems from choices made by Alex Blumberg
[00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:59.360]   and Matt Lieber, who was a former radio producer and management consultant.
[00:22:59.360 --> 00:23:04.880]   Now, and this is, I'm quoting the times now, former employees of Gimlet and subject to the
[00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:09.120]   podcast said they regard the test kitchen as a wasted opportunity to share a sweeping,
[00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:14.400]   detailed portrait of racism in the American workplace. By the way, this is from a section of the New
[00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:21.200]   York Times I never thought I'd see called the state of podcasting. What? Yeah. Yeah. No,
[00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:25.440]   they just have a bunch of stories and they're theming them under different things. So they've
[00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:29.840]   got several kind of broad. It's not. Yeah. The state of podcasting, a booming industry,
[00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:35.360]   the medium for quarantine, the voices of resistance growing up on Mike and podcast voice.
[00:23:36.160 --> 00:23:42.720]   That's the, those are the different pieces. Anyway, I don't know. Never mind. I'm sorry I brought it up.
[00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:47.520]   I thought just because maybe you might because of Epicurious and because of podcasting.
[00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:55.280]   Podcasting is booming. Will Hollywood help or hurt its future? I just, I feel like such a bystander.
[00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:59.360]   I know. Hello. Hello. Hello.
[00:23:59.360 --> 00:24:04.640]   I was there at the beginning. Hello. I want to, I want to, oh geez. This is how podcasting is.
[00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:10.400]   That horrible right felt when he, when he was watching Man Walk on the Moon or something. I don't know.
[00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:18.880]   Online 121 if you want it. Sure. Why not? All kinds of podcasts. I'll take my mouth and you
[00:24:18.880 --> 00:24:25.600]   take over. Go ahead. What is it? It's not in a green box. So I'm not sure whether we're allowed
[00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:30.880]   to talk about the state of podcast listening for 2021. What does the green box mean? Is that like
[00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:37.600]   we must already ask Jason? I asked Jason because I wasn't getting all the top stories in.
[00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:45.520]   Oh, okay. No, the stories that we, he felt like we really should do with a green box. And I was
[00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:49.040]   supposed to do that too. But I was, his judgment is very good. My gas station. He picks the right
[00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:56.000]   ones I think. Actually, I didn't, I didn't see this. Tom Webster is at Edison Research. He's great.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:01.360]   I've seen him speak many times. We're big fans. And Edison is probably the only company that does a
[00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:06.080]   lot of research on what people are doing in podcasting. I've seen him do this presentation before.
[00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:11.040]   Yeah. So it's just some new numbers on it. If you care. The percentage of Americans 12 plus
[00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:18.160]   who say they've ever listened to a podcast. Wow. 57%. Wow, you guys. That's a big jump.
[00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:22.480]   Yeah. That's a lot of people. How about it? How Leo? What are what the percentages who
[00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:31.440]   listen to a netcast? None. Zero. Or who have ever heard of Twit? Zero. No. Monthly podcast listening.
[00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:39.760]   116 million people listened to a podcast in the past month. That's up
[00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:46.080]   from what I don't, I can't read this. I don't understand. I haven't read this, but I, but does
[00:25:46.080 --> 00:25:52.160]   this address the notion that people are actually creating more podcasts now? Yeah.
[00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:56.640]   Well, I remember Tom talking about that a couple of years ago, and I can't remember the exact numbers,
[00:25:56.640 --> 00:26:03.520]   but it's something like 7 million new podcasts emerge every week. Of which it's so easy to do.
[00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:09.440]   500. Sorry. Still around in the second week. Yeah. It's something like that. I don't remember
[00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:14.080]   the exact numbers. If you go down to the bigger chart to the info. Yeah, this is a good chart.
[00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:20.720]   This infographic. 41% of Americans listened to a podcast in the last month, 28% in the last week.
[00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:29.120]   56% of the younger folk, those age 12 to 34, are monthly podcast listeners. In the last week,
[00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:34.480]   US weekly podcast listeners averaged eight episodes and 5.1 shows.
[00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:40.960]   That's pretty amazing. His stuff has been most useful for me to understand the difference between
[00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:47.920]   people who are new to podcasting, who listen in a very different way than people who are
[00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:52.160]   longtime listeners, most of our audience who've been listening for years. For instance,
[00:26:52.160 --> 00:27:02.000]   the vast majority of newer people listen on a phone and they listen to a stream. They don't
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:08.880]   download the show. They just listen to a stream. I, and I'm trying to remember the details of this,
[00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:16.480]   of the piece, but I also think I remember him saying they are less loyal. They don't listen to
[00:27:16.480 --> 00:27:22.000]   every episode of a show. They open their podcast client and they just
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:25.840]   pick up all through. Yeah, they do discover and they listen to the episode of their episode,
[00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:30.320]   their episode of your episode there. But I thought the thing that's really
[00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:35.920]   interesting. By the way, Apple has backed this up. Apple in the new version of iOS, which comes out
[00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:42.080]   any day now, probably sometime this month, will stop saying subscribe to a podcast.
[00:27:42.080 --> 00:27:47.680]   And I think this is going to become universal. Instead, they'll say follow. But the interesting
[00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:54.880]   difference is subscribe, in many cases, would download the episodes to your phone. Follow will
[00:27:54.880 --> 00:28:01.600]   not follow. And that is a reflection of the fact that most people stream. They don't, right? That's
[00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:06.240]   how we all do it now, right? We don't download our shows and then have them on our device.
[00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:11.280]   Ubiquitous high speed internet. And and and frankly, the fact that data doesn't cost
[00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:16.000]   anything anymore for most people means that they just you listen to whatever the same thing
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.440]   with your music. You don't download your music ahead of time anymore. You just
[00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:25.120]   write. How does it notify you? How does what notify you that no, no, they don't do that.
[00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:31.120]   Notify you. When I follow, how does it tell me? Oh, Leo has a new. That's all it will tell you.
[00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:34.080]   Yeah, I'll give you another question. Yeah, that's all I'll tell you won't download it.
[00:28:34.640 --> 00:28:41.280]   Yeah, right. Got it. So that's going to be the advantage of streaming is at least you get more data.
[00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:49.040]   Not really. No, no, it looks just like a download does. The difference though,
[00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:54.160]   and it's probably okay, but the difference is if people subscribe and they're automatically
[00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:59.600]   downloading, we get higher download numbers. Right. Just listen, they just download when they
[00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:04.160]   listen, right? Because they'll download stuff like the day of hits. I got a lot of hits on the web.
[00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:10.880]   Right. So, yeah. I missed those innocent days. Back to Google alphabet,
[00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:17.760]   and their moon shots, the X projects had something and I thought Stacy might know a little bit about
[00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:24.080]   this called Maya. Yeah, this was the. The tricorder. Yeah, they were.
[00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:29.360]   The tricorder. Sorry. Not the good thing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I vaguely remember this. So they
[00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:34.800]   killed it though, right? Yeah. It's impossible to put that many sensors into something.
[00:29:34.800 --> 00:29:42.000]   Well, this is the story from nine to five Google. It was canceled. It was intended to analyze
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:47.760]   skin health with light waves. And I thought it was kind of related to the earlier solely story.
[00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:55.520]   When they announced it back in 2019, they said skin health can tell us a lot about our overall
[00:29:55.520 --> 00:30:00.640]   health. For example, Jeff, John dis is an early sign of liver stress.
[00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:09.280]   Oh, no, you're pink, not yellow. You're right, of course. While the oxygen level of our skin can
[00:30:09.280 --> 00:30:16.240]   be an indicator of heart health, pink, not yellow. Today, the way today, the way we learn more about
[00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:22.320]   our skin and health is with biopsies, which obviously are invasive and require expert intervention
[00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:25.760]   and are often done reactively. I'm not feeling very well suddenly.
[00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:32.480]   Yeah, you're pink. Oh, now he's yellow now. Now he's yellow. Yeah. Oh, I'm getting more and more
[00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:38.320]   yellow. Oh, no, this is another moonshot like Project Loon that's been canceled. And in this
[00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:44.240]   case, because it was too broad and the success was hard to define for their moonshot to work. The
[00:30:44.240 --> 00:30:50.480]   Maya team, Google says had to tackle several high risk. I'm sorry, alphabet says high risks
[00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:54.800]   interconnected, hard to know where to start dimensions to the problem. So they're going to have to do a
[00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:57.840]   lot of work in different areas before they could even get a sense of when and whether they were
[00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:04.880]   making progress. And so they decided to end the project. This is too, basically, this is too hard.
[00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:09.040]   We quit. Yeah. Well, also sounds like Ruth. Go ahead, Stacy.
[00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:15.200]   Well, that and if it's, I mean, if you think about a device like this, who is going to buy it,
[00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:23.200]   how like it is kind of a broad device, if you think about like, this measures your health,
[00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:26.400]   what's it going to tell you that you're unhealthy? Do you call your doctor? Does it give you an
[00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:29.840]   indicate? I mean, like there's a lot of factors with something like this. I think in a way what
[00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:34.560]   they're really admitting is that the premise was flawed. You know, they had this science fiction
[00:31:34.560 --> 00:31:37.840]   idea that, oh, we just take a picture of your skin and we'll know exactly what's going on.
[00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:42.560]   And Jeff is the new like more typical Google ADD at the management.
[00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:46.080]   Yeah, I'll just wear that. I think you're right. I think you're right.
[00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:53.280]   Although if it's it's inevitable with X projects, these moonshots, most of them don't make it.
[00:31:53.280 --> 00:32:02.160]   Right. Yeah. Can I just have some sort of action plan or a like a, what is it forecasting?
[00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:07.760]   Or you don't just really benchmark a benchmarking. You don't really just
[00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:12.080]   willy-nilly throw stuff up to the wall to see if the sticks of course you do. But maybe they
[00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:16.640]   did. Maybe they had a little, the error is not a whole thing in ahead of time. No, the error is
[00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:21.760]   just telling us. Don't tell. I don't think so. What we talk about. That's what in that's what
[00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:25.600]   a moonshot is. It's like, Hey, we're going to throw this spaghetti at the wall. See what happens.
[00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:28.720]   Well, if you're worried about how people are going to be able to use hands with it, then you
[00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:32.320]   don't tell us about it. Well, they had a thought. I'm sure they had a thought. I'm sure there was a
[00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:37.760]   proposal. How long ago was this announced originally? Two years ago. See, I envisioned, I envisioned
[00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:42.800]   there's in Mountain View, there's Mount Porat. And every month it comes time on the 15th of the
[00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:48.400]   month, you have to find the Virgin to sacrifice. This was never a product. So that's the thing I,
[00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:53.840]   I think you got to have two buckets for this products to get canceled. I understand because
[00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:57.760]   you're using it or somebody's using it and blah, blah, blah. This was never a product. They announced
[00:32:57.760 --> 00:33:03.120]   something they were going to try didn't work. So they didn't stop doing it. That's called research.
[00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:08.160]   That's called research. Fashion for it. But sometimes they're products that wish didn't work.
[00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:13.680]   That's all. Well, I won't agree 100% that killed products too readily. But go ahead and say,
[00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:18.800]   say, remember back Project solely. Now this wasn't under moonshot. This was an ATAP project.
[00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:25.600]   But in 2015 is when they actually introduced. Project Tango. Project Tango first, right?
[00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:31.920]   No, it was called solely from the get go. Okay. Because Tango was similar. They did have a Tango.
[00:33:31.920 --> 00:33:37.840]   Yeah. But yeah, and they were like, yeah, we'll see what happens with it. It's Tango was AR.
[00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:40.480]   solely was the other way. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:41.840]   solely engine. Why does this sound?
[00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:49.680]   Why does this sound similar to the latest camera app update where it's
[00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:52.800]   sensing what's going on with your body just from taking a picture?
[00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:57.920]   Oh, maybe that was maybe that. Yeah, you're right. I don't know what the camera app update is.
[00:33:57.920 --> 00:34:01.040]   What is it? We talked about it. Oh, you haven't been in the recent change.
[00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:06.080]   I haven't been here. I haven't been here. It was one of the Google feature dumps.
[00:34:06.080 --> 00:34:12.080]   You know, they do those pixel feature. What do you pixel on? And one of the what is that?
[00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:16.080]   What do you see, I might. Did you see that? Yeah, I saw that.
[00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:21.440]   What the girl was that? No. Oh, it's the doc. No, no, there were some dots.
[00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:24.560]   There were some dots. Anyway, oh, that's the laser.
[00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:27.360]   Not lasers. I thought it might be the the light.
[00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:29.280]   That's the ghost of the camera.
[00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:37.280]   Sensors. They were going to they've added to this feature where you can hold it in front of you.
[00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:42.160]   It'll see how you're breathing. Actually, it does sound very similar.
[00:34:42.160 --> 00:34:44.320]   It probably is using solely, which is on the pixel.
[00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:46.640]   There it is again. It's on the phone.
[00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:49.440]   That's your sensor. That's your motion.
[00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:51.600]   Yeah, this is a four.
[00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:57.920]   So four does. If this is something we're already seeing in this new pixel feature drop,
[00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:01.600]   that's why I see it sounds like a little bit of ADD.
[00:35:01.600 --> 00:35:04.560]   You know, one part of them saying, okay, all right, let's roll this out.
[00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:08.720]   Then another part says, oh, scrap it. And where's the organization here?
[00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:15.840]   Yes. Right. This you could get a heart rate by putting your finger on the camera.
[00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:21.280]   Using the front facing camera, it would measure your overall respiratory rate
[00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:24.240]   by detecting small chest movements as you breathe.
[00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:29.040]   I think that was the March pixel feature drop.
[00:35:29.040 --> 00:35:33.920]   I think it's a little different because the the one they just canceled
[00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:37.360]   looked at skin. It was looking at your skin tone.
[00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:41.680]   It's my eye. I looked at. Yeah, that was many different wavelengths of light.
[00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:44.480]   Right. So different. It's kind. Yeah.
[00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:47.440]   Similar, but different. Similar, but different.
[00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:50.400]   This is another problem with Google, which is there are men.
[00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:54.160]   It's big. It's alphabet. It's huge. There's all sorts of stuff they're doing.
[00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:58.400]   Some of it. There's another problem.
[00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:00.640]   Another problem. Well, I think it is.
[00:36:00.640 --> 00:36:06.560]   Don't you think it's hard to manage such big companies and see them as focused?
[00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:07.840]   For some.
[00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:10.960]   Yeah, some of them are really good at it.
[00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:12.000]   Yeah.
[00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:16.640]   Google is. I think Google's got to throw a lot of
[00:36:16.640 --> 00:36:20.400]   a lot of spaghetti at the walls because you know, advertising.
[00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:21.200]   Not a girl. Great.
[00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:24.160]   Yeah. That's right.
[00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:29.280]   Google must face a suit over snooping in the incognito browser.
[00:36:29.280 --> 00:36:32.960]   I've seen it's funny. I've seen people respond both ways.
[00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:38.400]   This is Lucy Coe, a US district judge in San Jose,
[00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:42.960]   said the court concludes Google did not notify users.
[00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:47.840]   The Google engages in data collection when the users in private browsing mode,
[00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:51.520]   Google's incognito mode, but does anybody have Chrome in front of them?
[00:36:51.520 --> 00:36:53.680]   Yeah. I did.
[00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:59.760]   Go into incognito mode and you know, the spy with the hat and the glasses comes up,
[00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:04.320]   but read. I want somebody to read what it says because this is what Google tells you when you
[00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:05.520]   go into incognito mode.
[00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:07.200]   Then hold on.
[00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:14.160]   Now you can browse privately. Other people who use this device won't see your activity.
[00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:17.040]   However, downloads and bookmarks will be saved.
[00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:19.840]   Chrome won't save the following information.
[00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:21.760]   Your activity might still be visible.
[00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:27.200]   Your browsing history, cookies and site data information entered in forms,
[00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:28.160]   so on and so forth.
[00:37:28.160 --> 00:37:32.000]   Your activity might still be visible to websites you visit,
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:36.640]   your employee or school, your internet service provider.
[00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:41.120]   So this is every single time you go to incognito mode that pops up.
[00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:44.080]   To me, that's Google telling you.
[00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:45.760]   It's not.
[00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:45.760]   It's not.
[00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:50.080]   But they didn't have this forever. They used to when you went to incognito.
[00:37:50.080 --> 00:37:53.360]   They've had it for a long, long, long time.
[00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:58.960]   Like, well, I'm like, it's been so long since I've opened an incognito.
[00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:01.760]   Well, anyway, that's the dispute.
[00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:06.480]   The judge is saying literally Google did not you notify users that Google engages in data
[00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:08.560]   collection when the user is in private browsing mode.
[00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:10.240]   And I've had.
[00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:10.880]   The emotional part of this.
[00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:14.000]   I've seen a lot of people say, yeah, it doesn't say we.
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:18.320]   Says you're in that service, brother, your school, your employer, other websites.
[00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:19.040]   It doesn't say we.
[00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:21.200]   Okay, maybe.
[00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:23.280]   Anyway, the class action lawsuit goes ahead.
[00:38:23.280 --> 00:38:24.080]   It'll be interesting.
[00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:28.080]   I've seen a number of people in public forums like Reddit and on Twitter say,
[00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:28.560]   what do you mean?
[00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:29.280]   They didn't tell you.
[00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:32.640]   It's right there in the thing that pops up every single time.
[00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:33.920]   So.
[00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:36.160]   You know, anyway, there you go.
[00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:44.640]   I have to use Google incognito every day because I have my two Google accounts
[00:38:44.640 --> 00:38:46.000]   and they don't live happily together.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:46.160]   Yeah.
[00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:46.560]   The same.
[00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:47.040]   Yeah.
[00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:50.240]   Browser, my product complaint.
[00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:54.320]   So my school is incognito and my buzz machine is me.
[00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:58.320]   Google's going to say, and maybe this is maybe this is what the jury would have to decide.
[00:38:58.320 --> 00:39:01.200]   In the lawsuit, but Google's going to say.
[00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:06.560]   We tell you that the only thing you're hiding is from other people using this browser.
[00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:07.520]   That's the only place.
[00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:12.160]   It says that right there, but I do agree that it doesn't say specifically.
[00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:14.720]   And by the way, Google is going to continue to collect all the data.
[00:39:14.720 --> 00:39:19.200]   It's always collected, but they kind of imply that because everybody else is.
[00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:21.920]   How smart.
[00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:24.000]   Well, in incognito mode.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:25.040]   This is.
[00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:25.440]   Yeah.
[00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:27.600]   That's the big mistake is incognito.
[00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:30.640]   It's like it's like Tesla's autopilot.
[00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:32.960]   Yeah.
[00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:33.440]   Yeah.
[00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:35.280]   Don't name it incognito if you're not.
[00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:41.840]   It's going to come down to maybe this is going to be a jury decision on how smart users are,
[00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:43.520]   how much you can expect from users.
[00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:49.040]   And Google always airs on this because, in fact, most tech companies, but Google,
[00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:52.640]   especially because they're smart and they're engineers and they just go, well,
[00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:57.040]   could didn't you know that any idiot, any idiot would know this.
[00:39:57.040 --> 00:40:00.400]   Well, at least this is not like five pages of documents.
[00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:02.320]   It is a simple thing we just read.
[00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:03.280]   It's very clear.
[00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:03.680]   Yeah.
[00:40:03.680 --> 00:40:06.480]   It's here's here's in Google Chrome help.
[00:40:06.480 --> 00:40:11.200]   This this says how Google Chrome incognito keeps your browsing private.
[00:40:11.200 --> 00:40:17.360]   One sentence incognito mode can help keep your browsing private from other people who use your device.
[00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:18.640]   That's it.
[00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:19.520]   That's pretty clear.
[00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:19.760]   Done.
[00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:23.920]   And then it has a lot more if you want to know more, but.
[00:40:25.200 --> 00:40:29.120]   But you're right incognito kind of applies.
[00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:32.000]   It makes you feel like you're walking through the world without, you know,
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:35.440]   Apple calls it private browsing, right?
[00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:37.200]   It's not that Apple does the same thing.
[00:40:37.200 --> 00:40:38.640]   It's not that private.
[00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:41.360]   Here's a new private window from Firefox.
[00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:43.920]   You're in a private window.
[00:40:43.920 --> 00:40:48.160]   Firefox clears your search in browsing history when you quit the app or close all private
[00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:49.760]   browsing tabs and windows.
[00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:51.520]   By the way, that's exactly what Chrome does.
[00:40:51.520 --> 00:40:55.920]   While this doesn't make you anonymous to websites or your internet service provider,
[00:40:55.920 --> 00:41:00.480]   it makes it easier to keep what you do online private from anyone else who uses this computer.
[00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:02.080]   And then look at this.
[00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:06.000]   Firefox is a link common myths about private browsing.
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:12.080]   Myth one private browsing makes you anonymous on the internet.
[00:41:12.080 --> 00:41:17.760]   Myth two private browsing removes all traces of your browsing activity from your computer.
[00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:21.920]   Myth three private browsing doesn't display any browsing history.
[00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:23.920]   Myth four,
[00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:27.280]   Brave browser has a pretty similar symbol as well.
[00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:28.560]   Interesting.
[00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:30.160]   Well, I mean, because they can't they can't.
[00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:35.600]   I mean, they can't anonymize you without like a VPN or some other service, right?
[00:41:35.600 --> 00:41:37.440]   To your ISP or websites.
[00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:40.240]   Brave actually has Tor built in for that very reason, right?
[00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:45.040]   They have a private session and they also have a private session with Tor.
[00:41:45.040 --> 00:41:45.680]   With Tor, you know.
[00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:46.640]   Oh, that's.
[00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:46.960]   Ooh.
[00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:49.280]   That's heavy duty private.
[00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:50.560]   Although.
[00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:52.800]   That feels like I could take over a country using them.
[00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:55.440]   Let's stay.
[00:41:55.440 --> 00:41:56.400]   Stacey, let's do it.
[00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:59.440]   If you wanted to take over country, which country would you take over?
[00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:02.800]   Oh, a good one.
[00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:03.280]   Canada.
[00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:04.560]   Okay.
[00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:06.320]   That's a fight me.
[00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:07.600]   Higgin' botham.
[00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:10.880]   A lot easier to take over Canada than let's say Russia.
[00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:12.800]   So I'd go for it.
[00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:14.160]   Well, Russia's huge.
[00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:14.400]   True.
[00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:16.880]   I mean, do you really want to look at the polling?
[00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:18.720]   Of course, Canada is also huge.
[00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:19.520]   Canada is huge, but.
[00:42:19.520 --> 00:42:20.160]   Now they think about it.
[00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:21.040]   Yeah, well.
[00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:21.920]   Very nice.
[00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:23.760]   Canada is like Australia of the north.
[00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:25.680]   There's it's just all down here.
[00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:26.000]   That's right.
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:27.040]   All along the coast.
[00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:27.200]   Right.
[00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:28.000]   The border.
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:28.640]   That's just the border.
[00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:32.320]   Let's go to Texas.
[00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:34.160]   I know you just got out of there, but let's go back.
[00:42:34.160 --> 00:42:40.480]   This is another suit about Chrome's privacy sandbox.
[00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:45.920]   Google's Google antitrust suit takes aim at Chrome's privacy sandbox.
[00:42:46.880 --> 00:42:50.640]   Texas prosecutors say Google's trying to hide its true intentions
[00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:53.440]   behind a pretext of privacy.
[00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:59.520]   Is this about Google's, I couldn't understand if they're pissed because Google's changing
[00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:03.920]   the way they're doing something or if they're mad about the flock effort or what?
[00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:04.800]   Well, let me read.
[00:43:04.800 --> 00:43:05.680]   Let me mad at Google.
[00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:07.200]   Yeah.
[00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:08.240]   Everybody's just mad at Google.
[00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:09.680]   It's popular now to be mad at Google.
[00:43:09.680 --> 00:43:10.720]   It is absolutely.
[00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:11.360]   Find something.
[00:43:11.360 --> 00:43:14.080]   15 state attorneys general led by Texas.
[00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:18.400]   Um, file in December.
[00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:25.280]   It's one of three ongoing antitrust cases against Google, including a Colorado case and
[00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:27.920]   the Department of Justice's federal case.
[00:43:27.920 --> 00:43:31.440]   The updated complaint stays that
[00:43:31.440 --> 00:43:39.520]   privacy sandbox, a Google tool that's supposed to replace invasive third party tracking cookies
[00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:40.800]   with a more limited.
[00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:43.120]   So this is about flock with a more limited system.
[00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:44.000]   This is flock.
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:44.320]   Okay.
[00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:45.600]   Designed by Google.
[00:43:45.600 --> 00:43:47.360]   Here's what the complaint says.
[00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:53.200]   Google's new scheme flock, which is the federated learning of cohorts, federated something of cohorts.
[00:43:53.200 --> 00:44:00.960]   Google's new scheme is the AG's right in essence to wall off the entire portion of the
[00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:03.840]   internet that consumers access through Chrome.
[00:44:03.840 --> 00:44:09.760]   Um, blocking cookies might broadly be a good thing.
[00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:12.960]   Other browsers have already done it, but Chrome dominates the browser market.
[00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:16.960]   And it's part of a much larger Google product suite.
[00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:22.160]   The suit argues that Google's plans would require advertisers to use it as a middleman,
[00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:23.680]   so that it's first party, right?
[00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:27.360]   And would make Google's advertising system far more attractive.
[00:44:27.360 --> 00:44:31.920]   That's kind of what we've insinuated over the last few weeks about flock.
[00:44:31.920 --> 00:44:35.840]   This is a decent case, even though Paxton is bringing it.
[00:44:35.840 --> 00:44:40.240]   GIRR. Yeah. But it's also a can't win case.
[00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:41.600]   You must get rid of cookies.
[00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:43.280]   Oh, okay.
[00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:46.560]   And by the way, third party tracking is awful.
[00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:47.600]   Oh, okay.
[00:44:47.600 --> 00:44:50.240]   Well, no, what they're I mean, what they're saying here is.
[00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:55.440]   No, what they're saying is Google is, uh,
[00:44:55.440 --> 00:44:58.080]   was not misinterpreting.
[00:44:58.080 --> 00:44:58.800]   What is it saying?
[00:44:58.800 --> 00:44:59.840]   Misleading.
[00:44:59.840 --> 00:45:02.560]   It's misleading people about what it's doing.
[00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:05.920]   And in fact, it's putting itself in a middleman position.
[00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:07.520]   And.
[00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:10.560]   Yeah.
[00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:14.640]   Google's response is attorney general Paxton's latest claims
[00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:17.040]   mischaracterize many aspects of our business,
[00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:21.280]   including the steps we're taking with the privacy sandbox initiative
[00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:24.240]   to protect people's privacy as they browse the web.
[00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:27.920]   These efforts have been welcomed by privacy advocates.
[00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:32.640]   No one I know EFF wrote a scathing article about the flock.
[00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:33.680]   Oh, yeah.
[00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:36.480]   Advertisers or our own rivals.
[00:45:36.480 --> 00:45:39.600]   Ah, as a step forward in preserving user privacy
[00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:42.240]   and protecting free content, we strongly will
[00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:47.200]   strongly defend ourselves from AG Paxton's baseless claim in court.
[00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:49.840]   Uh, so there you go.
[00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:50.480]   There's another one.
[00:45:50.480 --> 00:45:56.640]   It's it's tough to be a massive multinational tech
[00:45:56.640 --> 00:45:57.760]   conglomerate these days.
[00:45:57.760 --> 00:45:58.560]   Life is hard.
[00:45:58.560 --> 00:46:01.840]   Yes, I pity them as they.
[00:46:01.840 --> 00:46:04.080]   What are the stock prices right now?
[00:46:04.080 --> 00:46:05.040]   Hold on.
[00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:10.720]   We were talking during windows weekly about Microsoft,
[00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:12.320]   President Brad Smith's.
[00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:14.000]   We talked about last week too on this show.
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:21.120]   Testimony in Congress, uh, you know, saying that Google, uh, you know,
[00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:24.720]   the Australia should go after Google over this snippet thing.
[00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:27.680]   In fact, so should everybody else, including, I think he is in
[00:46:27.680 --> 00:46:30.960]   terms of the US Congress to which Google responded.
[00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:32.400]   It was corporate.
[00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:33.280]   What is this?
[00:46:33.280 --> 00:46:38.720]   It blatant corporate, uh, any competitive behavior.
[00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:41.120]   They feel like Microsoft's piling on.
[00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:45.120]   I kind of, I kind of honestly defended Google in that case,
[00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:46.800]   at least earlier today on windows weekly.
[00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:52.160]   It is, I do feel like it's Microsoft, which should be defending big tech.
[00:46:52.160 --> 00:46:55.680]   It's Rupert Mark and the internet against the world.
[00:46:55.680 --> 00:46:59.200]   Instead, they went and got into bed with Murdoch in this case and they,
[00:46:59.200 --> 00:46:59.760]   they claim.
[00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:05.920]   So I talked to a council on that committee and a staffer on that committee
[00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:09.760]   and, um, other folk at a reporter about it recently.
[00:47:09.760 --> 00:47:14.160]   And you know, Brad Smith is there trying to claim credit for bringing Google to the
[00:47:14.160 --> 00:47:18.160]   table because, because he threatened that Bing would stay in Australia.
[00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:22.400]   And that just brought Google to their knees and his R and since,
[00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:25.360]   it's, you can thank us for Google's money.
[00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:27.120]   Jesus Christ, Eddie Haskell.
[00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:28.400]   Googles.
[00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:30.080]   I just can't walk her.
[00:47:30.080 --> 00:47:36.000]   Google's council called Microsoft support for the Australian law,
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:38.480]   naked corporate opportunism.
[00:47:38.480 --> 00:47:39.120]   That's it.
[00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:39.120]   That's it.
[00:47:39.120 --> 00:47:40.960]   That was the phrase I was looking for.
[00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:42.240]   So right.
[00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:42.560]   Yeah.
[00:47:42.560 --> 00:47:48.560]   Microsoft is admitted as much if you remember what Brad Smith said about lobbyists.
[00:47:48.560 --> 00:47:48.800]   Yeah.
[00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:49.680]   That is.
[00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:50.000]   Yeah.
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:51.520]   That's, you know, that's what we do.
[00:47:51.520 --> 00:47:54.560]   In fact, surprise surprise.
[00:47:54.560 --> 00:47:59.040]   US lawmakers propose Australia's style bill for media tech negotiations.
[00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:03.920]   This is by the way, a non partisan bill, the journalism,
[00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:07.200]   competition and preservation act of 2021.
[00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:13.760]   Uh, David Chitulini of Rhode Island, Democrat of Rhode Island, introduced the proposal.
[00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:18.800]   This bill will give hard working local reporters and publishers the helping hand
[00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:22.800]   they need right now so they can continue to do their important work.
[00:48:22.800 --> 00:48:30.240]   Co-signers include Republican Ken Buck in the house and Mark Desolina in the,
[00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:34.240]   in the house, Amy Klobuchar in the Senate and John Kennedy.
[00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:35.920]   Boy, talk about strange bedfellows.
[00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:37.520]   John Kennedy, Amy Klobuchar.
[00:48:37.520 --> 00:48:38.400]   Yep.
[00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:39.040]   All co-spots.
[00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:39.680]   It's pretty awful.
[00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:42.160]   I, I've read the law of the bill.
[00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:46.640]   And, um, it drives me nuts in all kinds of ways.
[00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:53.040]   It defines a news content creator, you know, who could get, if, if they can band together and get a,
[00:48:53.040 --> 00:48:58.080]   a, a, a exception to antitrust and can then as a powerful force,
[00:48:58.080 --> 00:49:00.800]   negotiate against these big evil platforms.
[00:49:00.800 --> 00:49:01.760]   Well, who would that be?
[00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:08.640]   Well, it's written by the trade association that is controlled by newspapers owned by hedge funds.
[00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:16.800]   It is meant for the big old, it's just like Australia, a few big old companies versus big new tech platforms.
[00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:22.080]   Any, so it requires you have a dedicated professional editorial staff that creates and
[00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:27.520]   distributes original news and related content, um, uh, at least a weekly basis.
[00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:33.440]   So all these guys on substac screw you, all these people start in these amazing blogs and
[00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:35.120]   new sites to help with you.
[00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:39.360]   It has to be marketed through subscriptions, advertising and sponsorship.
[00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:42.560]   So what about, about public radio?
[00:49:42.560 --> 00:49:43.680]   What about the 19th?
[00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:44.560]   What about other things?
[00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:49.200]   Um, it has to have at least 25% current news.
[00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:50.800]   That's an old postal regulation.
[00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:52.880]   That's how old fashioned they are.
[00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:54.160]   And then who's this against?
[00:49:54.160 --> 00:50:01.840]   It is the online content distributor is defined as any site that does these things
[00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:04.640]   that has no fewer than one billion monthly active users.
[00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:08.480]   So it's tight and V old Titan V new Titan.
[00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:09.520]   That's all this is.
[00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:16.080]   And it is, it is anti competitive as hell because new startups to compete with all these old
[00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:21.520]   fart newspapers that have screwed up the last four decades won't be able to get any of this.
[00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:23.280]   And this is their effort of protectionism.
[00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:25.040]   So that's what I screamed about.
[00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:29.840]   So you disagree with Microsoft president Brad Smith who said the problems that beset journalism
[00:50:29.840 --> 00:50:34.080]   today, I don't know how he became an expert on this, but he is the problems that beset
[00:50:34.080 --> 00:50:39.840]   journalism today are caused in part by a fundamental lack of competition in the search and ad tech
[00:50:39.840 --> 00:50:41.840]   markets that are controlled by Google.
[00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:45.120]   You disagree that that's, that's not the problem with beset journalism today?
[00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:46.080]   Uh, yeah.
[00:50:46.080 --> 00:50:46.640]   Yeah.
[00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:50.240]   It's like the problem that beset, you know, Microsoft's being today.
[00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:51.200]   Exactly.
[00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:55.520]   So I got called by a staffer to perhaps testify, but what are going to happen?
[00:50:55.520 --> 00:51:00.880]   Um, so I did submit a statement to the subcommittee and was actually in the record.
[00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:01.440]   I saw that.
[00:51:01.440 --> 00:51:02.320]   I kind of don't know that before.
[00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:02.480]   Nice.
[00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:03.120]   Kind of cool.
[00:51:03.120 --> 00:51:03.600]   Yeah.
[00:51:04.480 --> 00:51:05.840]   Um, you posted it on medium as well.
[00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:08.880]   So people can this or on your blog to put it on my blog.
[00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:10.080]   So you wouldn't complain about medium.
[00:51:10.080 --> 00:51:10.240]   Yeah.
[00:51:10.240 --> 00:51:14.720]   No, he didn't buy the subscription to medium.
[00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:19.680]   I did, but I'm glad that Jeff is supporting small local publishers like Buzz Machine.
[00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:21.040]   Yes, that's right.
[00:51:21.040 --> 00:51:22.160]   We'll get nothing out of this.
[00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:28.560]   Uh, so I go through all the international regulations not working, but then I say to grant
[00:51:28.560 --> 00:51:33.520]   newspaper owners an exemption from antitrust would be profoundly anti-competitive for
[00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:37.360]   wood as in Australia and trench the interest of the largest companies on both sides of the
[00:51:37.360 --> 00:51:39.200]   table, media and technology.
[00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:40.400]   Let me play devil's advocate.
[00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:42.560]   So you never do that.
[00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:49.200]   So, um, I'm guessing that the intent, I mean, it sounds like the intent to create this,
[00:51:49.200 --> 00:51:52.800]   this 48 month carve out, because otherwise it would be collusion.
[00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:56.320]   It would be, it would, by the way, this is funny because the sponsor of this bill is
[00:51:56.320 --> 00:51:58.000]   the head of the House antitrust committee.
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:51:58.560]   Exactly.
[00:51:58.560 --> 00:52:00.160]   Uh, but, but normally this,
[00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:05.760]   for you guys, yeah, more or really this would be collusion and, and, and trust, uh, activity
[00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:12.960]   is for the newspapers to all get together and, um, and new joint is a force to do collective
[00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:15.040]   bargaining with Google and Facebook over this.
[00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:21.840]   Um, you're saying it favors the big ones, but doesn't this also give our little Petaluma
[00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:22.720]   Argus career?
[00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:27.520]   Um, and, uh, you know, other small, maybe even sub stack and medium.
[00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:29.280]   I see the table too.
[00:52:29.280 --> 00:52:30.720]   That's, that's the point, right?
[00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:37.760]   Uh, a not really because it, it still requires, they have, I think,
[00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:39.280]   was it minimum staff in there?
[00:52:39.280 --> 00:52:42.320]   Um, so they can't be too small.
[00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:43.920]   No, they can't be too small.
[00:52:43.920 --> 00:52:46.880]   I couldn't, I couldn't go in and say, well, I'm, I'm a journalist.
[00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:48.960]   I'd like to join the negotiations.
[00:52:48.960 --> 00:52:54.880]   Um, I, you know, the problem is this bill was written as, as one reporter told me directly,
[00:52:54.880 --> 00:53:01.120]   this was written by, uh, David Chauvin, who's, who's the head of the trade association,
[00:53:01.120 --> 00:53:04.800]   formerly known as the newspaper association, but they realized the newspapers have kudos.
[00:53:04.800 --> 00:53:06.240]   So they renamed it an LA.
[00:53:06.240 --> 00:53:07.680]   I think it's the one, no, this is an LA.
[00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:12.960]   Is this no, um, but anyway, a trade association representative.
[00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:13.920]   Trade association, right?
[00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:15.680]   And they're, and they're mostly the big boys.
[00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:18.240]   News, the alliance, no, no, no news, the alliance.
[00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:18.800]   Mm-hm.
[00:53:18.800 --> 00:53:20.560]   Um, sorry.
[00:53:20.560 --> 00:53:23.680]   Um, and, and, and so.
[00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:32.000]   So it limits, well, the other thing is to negotiate what, by the way, a deal, just as,
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:33.280]   well, but what does the deal mean, right?
[00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:37.600]   So Google saying, well, and Facebook are both saying we have products where we will
[00:53:37.600 --> 00:53:40.480]   license news and we're doing that and we'll negotiate with you.
[00:53:40.480 --> 00:53:40.960]   And there it is.
[00:53:40.960 --> 00:53:42.880]   They're already saying that.
[00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:45.040]   So what is it that they really want?
[00:53:45.040 --> 00:53:49.600]   The other thing that the reporter I was talking to was speculating about is it says
[00:53:49.600 --> 00:53:55.440]   something about how they can negotiate, um, the negotiations are not limited to price,
[00:53:55.440 --> 00:53:56.880]   price for what it doesn't say.
[00:53:56.880 --> 00:54:03.360]   Um, and then directly relate to quality, accuracy, attribution, or branding and
[00:54:03.360 --> 00:54:04.800]   the interoperability of news.
[00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:09.440]   What I interpret that is, is favor us, not other people.
[00:54:09.440 --> 00:54:12.320]   Favor my members and not other people.
[00:54:12.320 --> 00:54:16.320]   Uh, this is, this is anti-competitive as hell.
[00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:22.400]   But it doesn't, I mean, it doesn't prescribe any solution, right?
[00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:26.800]   They're just saying, look, we're, we're going to let you collude for four, four years.
[00:54:26.800 --> 00:54:27.920]   Right.
[00:54:27.920 --> 00:54:32.800]   And when I was also told in Australia was that there, the government was actively
[00:54:32.800 --> 00:54:34.960]   negotiating, which is just appalling.
[00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:35.280]   Right.
[00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:38.000]   Should the governments part?
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:40.720]   But that's what's kind of happening here is that is it, is it at some point the
[00:54:40.720 --> 00:54:42.000]   government's going to say, okay, that's enough.
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:42.800]   That's enough.
[00:54:42.800 --> 00:54:43.280]   That's okay.
[00:54:43.280 --> 00:54:45.280]   You got, you got enough of your hide and go home.
[00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:46.160]   Right.
[00:54:47.840 --> 00:54:48.080]   Yeah.
[00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:50.000]   My industry.
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:50.640]   All right.
[00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:51.360]   Can't stand them.
[00:54:51.360 --> 00:54:53.440]   Let's take a little break.
[00:54:53.440 --> 00:54:56.880]   We have other things to talk about.
[00:54:56.880 --> 00:55:00.640]   I'm going to, I'm going to raise Jeff's blood pressure by bringing up Facebook in a second.
[00:55:00.640 --> 00:55:03.520]   But you're just don't, just don't call me evil.
[00:55:03.520 --> 00:55:04.240]   That's all I ask.
[00:55:04.240 --> 00:55:06.880]   I never show me the tape.
[00:55:06.880 --> 00:55:08.560]   What did I say?
[00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:09.360]   You're evil.
[00:55:09.360 --> 00:55:12.160]   Facebook's evil.
[00:55:12.160 --> 00:55:16.400]   I'm not saying Jeff Jarvis is evil unless you're, are you Facebook?
[00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:18.800]   No, certainly not.
[00:55:18.800 --> 00:55:21.200]   I do think Facebook's kind of evil.
[00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:26.960]   Not if I say anything in defense of the internet, then you accuse me of being
[00:55:26.960 --> 00:55:28.480]   no and league with a double.
[00:55:28.480 --> 00:55:30.160]   I'm in, I'm in favor of the internet.
[00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:32.560]   I don't think Facebook's good for the internet.
[00:55:32.560 --> 00:55:33.840]   Go to your break.
[00:55:33.840 --> 00:55:34.480]   Go to your break.
[00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:40.000]   I'm defending the internet as, as we used to know it.
[00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:41.280]   I'm defending the internet.
[00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:42.800]   Oh my gosh.
[00:55:42.800 --> 00:55:44.000]   Who's our advertiser?
[00:55:46.960 --> 00:55:48.080]   Thank you sponsor.
[00:55:48.080 --> 00:55:50.240]   3M Micro-Pore Surgical Tape.
[00:55:50.240 --> 00:55:54.640]   If you've ever wanted to shut Leo up.
[00:55:54.640 --> 00:55:59.200]   A little piece, a little pinch between the cheek and gum.
[00:55:59.200 --> 00:56:02.160]   A little dabble do ya.
[00:56:02.160 --> 00:56:06.640]   Does your dear wife ever threaten you with it?
[00:56:06.640 --> 00:56:09.360]   No, she thinks I'm weird.
[00:56:09.360 --> 00:56:15.920]   Well, she, she thinks I'm so weird to do this.
[00:56:15.920 --> 00:56:18.480]   I've only done it for three nights, but it's, it's, you know what?
[00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:20.240]   At first I thought, oh, I'll never be able to do this.
[00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:24.240]   I'll be tearing it off or I'll, in my sleep, all unconsciously.
[00:56:24.240 --> 00:56:28.320]   No, I wake feeling better than ever rested.
[00:56:28.320 --> 00:56:30.480]   My allergies are gone.
[00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:31.920]   My sinuses are clear.
[00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:35.600]   I look forward to taping up my mouth every night.
[00:56:35.600 --> 00:56:40.240]   I'm going to try it, but I will say I don't breathe through my mouth.
[00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:42.080]   And so this whole book looks silly to me.
[00:56:42.080 --> 00:56:43.040]   I'm reading all the reasons.
[00:56:43.040 --> 00:56:44.640]   Good. You should breathe through your mouth.
[00:56:44.640 --> 00:56:44.880]   Good.
[00:56:44.880 --> 00:56:45.680]   You're healthy.
[00:56:45.680 --> 00:56:47.760]   I had to. I've got a deviated septum.
[00:56:47.760 --> 00:56:48.000]   Yes.
[00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:50.320]   And, and he says that's a result.
[00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:51.760]   He passed soft food.
[00:56:51.760 --> 00:56:52.240]   Do it.
[00:56:52.240 --> 00:56:52.640]   Yeah.
[00:56:52.640 --> 00:56:54.080]   Oh, come on.
[00:56:54.080 --> 00:56:55.360]   Cane can did not have sea pebs.
[00:56:55.360 --> 00:56:57.440]   It was the boxing match I got in.
[00:56:57.440 --> 00:56:57.840]   Okay.
[00:56:57.840 --> 00:57:01.600]   No, he talks about deviated seepods.
[00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:03.920]   Are very common.
[00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:09.680]   Deviated septums, where your septum is like at this instead of like a, like that.
[00:57:09.680 --> 00:57:11.360]   And like a triangle.
[00:57:12.560 --> 00:57:14.320]   And another attack on my kachoya.
[00:57:14.320 --> 00:57:15.760]   I'm not appreciative.
[00:57:15.760 --> 00:57:21.840]   I showed they brought to you by actually by a very interesting company for the company for our
[00:57:21.840 --> 00:57:26.320]   times, Nareva, as we think about heading back to the office.
[00:57:26.320 --> 00:57:28.160]   You know, you know, it's not going to be the same.
[00:57:28.160 --> 00:57:31.920]   Distancing can have big implications for meeting room audio.
[00:57:31.920 --> 00:57:36.000]   It can require that you separate people socially distanced.
[00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:40.640]   Maybe you have a limited number of people in the room, all kinds of things.
[00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:45.760]   Nevertheless, the most important factor is you got to have good mic coverage,
[00:57:45.760 --> 00:57:48.000]   even if people are separated in a meeting room.
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:48.880]   How do you do that?
[00:57:48.880 --> 00:57:51.600]   Being forming systems.
[00:57:51.600 --> 00:57:57.360]   Well, they got to be, you know, calibrated and adjusted by expensive technicians and aimed and
[00:57:57.360 --> 00:57:58.160]   recalibrated.
[00:57:58.160 --> 00:58:00.960]   And even then once you get it set up, nobody can move.
[00:58:00.960 --> 00:58:03.200]   This is like there's a dot on this, on the table.
[00:58:03.200 --> 00:58:04.080]   That's where you have to sit.
[00:58:04.080 --> 00:58:06.400]   Tabletop systems.
[00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:10.560]   Yeah, but then you need more mics and you're going to have to sanitize in between meetings.
[00:58:10.560 --> 00:58:15.680]   In both cases, participants are going to have to change their behavior, like sitting in pre-determined
[00:58:15.680 --> 00:58:18.560]   spots and where they face and all of that.
[00:58:18.560 --> 00:58:20.560]   That's why Nareva is so cool.
[00:58:20.560 --> 00:58:24.880]   Most conventional audio systems don't give you the flexibility you need to accommodate
[00:58:24.880 --> 00:58:26.960]   the modern workspace.
[00:58:26.960 --> 00:58:32.160]   But what if there were a better way to get clear, reliable audio and still let your
[00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:34.000]   team act naturally and still feel safe?
[00:58:34.000 --> 00:58:34.800]   That's Nareva.
[00:58:34.800 --> 00:58:36.880]   It's designed for distancing.
[00:58:36.880 --> 00:58:39.120]   In fact, one analyst called Nareva Audio the first
[00:58:39.760 --> 00:58:41.440]   socially distanced mic system.
[00:58:41.440 --> 00:58:42.560]   And you don't need a technician.
[00:58:42.560 --> 00:58:44.320]   You don't need to calibrate it.
[00:58:44.320 --> 00:58:45.440]   It's really easy.
[00:58:45.440 --> 00:58:51.280]   You can install every microphone and speaker bar on the wall yourself.
[00:58:51.280 --> 00:58:54.480]   It's really it's basically computational audio.
[00:58:54.480 --> 00:59:00.000]   Nareva's patented, they have four patents on this microphone, missed technology,
[00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:03.280]   fills the room with thousands of virtual microphones.
[00:59:03.280 --> 00:59:08.960]   So no matter who's in the room, no matter how they're distanced, no matter where they're facing,
[00:59:09.520 --> 00:59:11.200]   they all come in crystal clear.
[00:59:11.200 --> 00:59:13.440]   It's brilliant.
[00:59:13.440 --> 00:59:18.000]   It adapts to any room configuration and automatically re-adaptes as you move things
[00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:19.920]   around as people move around as things change.
[00:59:19.920 --> 00:59:25.920]   Nareva and you are EVA audio products of one numerous awards, including the Top New
[00:59:25.920 --> 00:59:28.720]   Technology Award at ISE 2020.
[00:59:28.720 --> 00:59:30.640]   That was for their HDL 200 system.
[00:59:30.640 --> 00:59:34.960]   But no matter the size of your room, they have a full line of systems for small, medium,
[00:59:34.960 --> 00:59:39.600]   and large spaces. HubSpot uses the next step up, the HDL 300.
[00:59:39.600 --> 00:59:43.600]   Jimmy Yan, who's their principal collaboration engineer at HubSpot said,
[00:59:43.600 --> 00:59:47.120]   "We were so impressed with the sound quality, the ease of install,
[00:59:47.120 --> 00:59:49.280]   the ease of use of the HDL 300.
[00:59:49.280 --> 00:59:52.160]   It was just a no-brainer for us to adopt it."
[00:59:52.160 --> 00:59:55.440]   It's kind of cool.
[00:59:55.440 --> 00:59:57.120]   It's really a cool technology.
[00:59:57.120 --> 01:00:01.040]   Microphone, missed means everybody sounds good as on mic.
[01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:01.920]   You can understand them.
[01:00:01.920 --> 01:00:03.280]   It really will transform.
[01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:08.480]   And by the way, we were talking the other day on one of the shows about Zoom fatigue.
[01:00:08.480 --> 01:00:11.920]   One of the real issues with the fatigue is just bad audio quality.
[01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:13.840]   Nareva solves that.
[01:00:13.840 --> 01:00:19.760]   You can hear what's going on to learn more about how Nareva audio is the simple,
[01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:24.800]   cost-effective way to let your teams distance in meetings and still act and converse naturally.
[01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:29.840]   Visit Nareva, N-U-R-E-V-A, Nareva.com/twit.
[01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:32.960]   Nareva.com/twit.
[01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:36.880]   What clever idea solves meeting room audio.
[01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:39.520]   Nareva's designed for distancing.
[01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:41.200]   We thank him so much for supporting this week.
[01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:43.120]   Google.
[01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:50.320]   See, Facebook, I think Facebook, what do you think of Campbell Brown,
[01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:50.800]   Jeff?
[01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:51.440]   Do you like her?
[01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:52.160]   Do you think she's?
[01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:53.920]   She's now.
[01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:58.720]   I mean, time for full disclosure is that Facebook has funded activities at my school
[01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:00.960]   around quality and news.
[01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:02.720]   And that came from Campbell Brown's budget.
[01:01:02.720 --> 01:01:05.280]   I'm paid nothing personally by any of the platform.
[01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:08.640]   She was a network news correspondent, right?
[01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:12.080]   And people, I'll be one people when she took, she got that job.
[01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:16.320]   People thought a TV person?
[01:01:16.320 --> 01:01:17.520]   What?
[01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:23.520]   This is going to be, but she is adept at dealing with internal and external politics
[01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:25.600]   in this very touchy area.
[01:01:25.600 --> 01:01:29.600]   And she has fought for journalism and news inside Facebook.
[01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:32.880]   So I've come to respect what she does there.
[01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:34.320]   She's been the global news.
[01:01:34.320 --> 01:01:35.840]   New job partnerships at Facebook.
[01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:42.480]   And it was Campbell Brown who made the announcement this week as writers,
[01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:45.680]   actually it was yesterday, as writers, experts, and journalists published,
[01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:50.240]   I'm reading from her post, published more of the work independently.
[01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:50.800]   We're working.
[01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:53.280]   We Facebook are working to better support these efforts
[01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:57.280]   and make it easier for these content creators to build businesses online.
[01:01:57.280 --> 01:01:59.600]   Well, Stacey, you're the target for this.
[01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:03.680]   And actually anybody does a newsletter.
[01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:07.120]   You know, I mean, the cynic in me will say, yeah, they're looking over at sub stack
[01:02:07.120 --> 01:02:12.000]   and review, which is the new newsletter platform, Twitter, just acquired and saying,
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:13.360]   I have a new rule.
[01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:17.440]   New rule is all social networks do everything that all social networks do.
[01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:18.400]   They just copy each other.
[01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:18.640]   Yeah.
[01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:18.880]   Yeah.
[01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:19.440]   Copy each other.
[01:02:19.440 --> 01:02:20.080]   It is.
[01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:20.320]   Yeah.
[01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:22.000]   In the coming months.
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.080]   I would not ever host anything on Facebook.
[01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:26.160]   You know, it's funny.
[01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:32.240]   Well, my my antipathy aside, you know, when Facebook live came out, everybody said,
[01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:34.080]   oh, you should stream on Facebook live.
[01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:37.520]   I'm always reluctant to rely on a platform that you don't control.
[01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:38.800]   Yes.
[01:02:38.800 --> 01:02:41.680]   You know, that's the baseline.
[01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:42.800]   I'm like, yep, that's it.
[01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:44.240]   Yeah, I think that's the lesson.
[01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:48.480]   And also, I mean, pages I have put in the old days, pages was liked.
[01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:53.840]   I put stuff up on pages, but then pages fell into this repair.
[01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:55.200]   And now it's coming back up again.
[01:02:55.200 --> 01:02:57.840]   So are they going to promote things that you don't know?
[01:02:57.840 --> 01:02:58.640]   That's the question.
[01:02:58.640 --> 01:03:00.000]   This sounds attractive though.
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:01.760]   This is what Brown writes.
[01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:04.560]   We'll introduce a new platform to empower independent writers, helping them.
[01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:05.680]   Oh, I said that.
[01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:08.960]   We'll start by partnering with a small subset of independent writers.
[01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:13.040]   I mean, Stacy, you're exactly the kind of person that she's thinking of, I think.
[01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:17.200]   The platform will include a variety of support focused on content creation
[01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:20.240]   and audience growth, including a free self publishing tool
[01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:23.200]   with robust styling options to create individual websites
[01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:26.080]   and email newsletter, sub stack or medium maybe.
[01:03:26.080 --> 01:03:29.760]   And integration with Facebook pages to enable publishing across
[01:03:29.760 --> 01:03:34.160]   various multimedia formats, photos, live videos and stories,
[01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:37.440]   the ability to create Facebook groups, nurture community readers.
[01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:40.720]   This sounds a lot like other initiatives Facebook is.
[01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:41.440]   Yeah.
[01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:47.200]   And I don't know if I'm the perfect person for this, simply because I have my own ad sales.
[01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:49.200]   Yeah, you have your own business model, right?
[01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:55.280]   Like these are basically just trying to make money on journalists, which is fine.
[01:03:55.280 --> 01:03:56.240]   But...
[01:03:56.240 --> 01:04:00.720]   I think they would say, we're trying to share some money with you.
[01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:02.640]   Oh, I don't think they're going to make money on this.
[01:04:02.640 --> 01:04:10.720]   I think this is like much of what the platform's do these days with news is a PR effort.
[01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:16.240]   Well, then I would just say to everybody who does this, remember Facebook's pivot to video,
[01:04:16.240 --> 01:04:19.920]   push for everybody and the lies and...
[01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:22.880]   Maybe I would not touch this with a 10-foot pole.
[01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:24.720]   I would not touch this with a 40-foot pole.
[01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:27.360]   So just stick to medium.
[01:04:27.360 --> 01:04:30.080]   Essentially stick to medium.
[01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:31.440]   Mediums, just a word for us.
[01:04:31.440 --> 01:04:32.400]   Yeah.
[01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:34.640]   Mediums is bad because that's their platform.
[01:04:34.640 --> 01:04:37.120]   That's why I always encourage...
[01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:38.560]   And I think actually,
[01:04:38.560 --> 01:04:43.440]   Jeff kind of does it right, which is he publishes on medium where there's an audience,
[01:04:43.440 --> 01:04:46.160]   but he also cross-publishes on his own personal blog.
[01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:47.920]   So you never lose control of it.
[01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:49.280]   And I also...
[01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:54.320]   Sometimes cross-post onto LinkedIn.
[01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:58.800]   In the old days, I used to cross-post onto HuffPost and Guardian comment is free.
[01:04:58.800 --> 01:05:03.120]   I'd be okay with this posting onto Facebook, but to make it your home,
[01:05:03.120 --> 01:05:09.200]   I mean years ago, and I did say this years ago, and I'll recant now,
[01:05:09.200 --> 01:05:10.160]   I think Stacy's right.
[01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:13.200]   You don't want it to be too dependent when they can pull the rug out.
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:18.960]   I did try to argue years ago that the platform should make it possible for independent journalists.
[01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:20.720]   They should have the package do this.
[01:05:20.720 --> 01:05:23.680]   But I think the world has moved on to a relationship.
[01:05:23.680 --> 01:05:29.920]   Is it a generation of things that they feel like this is a worthy carrot to dangle?
[01:05:29.920 --> 01:05:36.800]   Maybe the younger journalists or what have you thinking this is something viable?
[01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:40.160]   Aren't they all on their own wicks pages or whatnot?
[01:05:40.160 --> 01:05:41.200]   Is that...
[01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:46.560]   Do any of these platforms insist on exclusivity?
[01:05:46.560 --> 01:05:48.000]   No.
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:49.680]   It's always assumed that you'll be public.
[01:05:49.680 --> 01:05:50.320]   Does some stack?
[01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:51.280]   I don't even do some stuff.
[01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:52.240]   Here's what I would like.
[01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:57.520]   As a journalist, as a working journalist, what I would like is I want to host things on...
[01:05:57.520 --> 01:06:00.320]   Or I want to do things and keep them for me.
[01:06:00.320 --> 01:06:02.960]   So let's say WordPress, because I can control it.
[01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:08.000]   And then I would have a simple way to automatically cross-post and format this.
[01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:08.000]   Yes.
[01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.480]   Or LinkedIn, Medium, or whatever.
[01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:11.840]   But no one is doing that.
[01:06:11.840 --> 01:06:13.920]   I would actually pay money for that.
[01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:14.720]   That would be valuable.
[01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:19.360]   Because cutting and pasting is just kind of such a pain.
[01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:21.280]   Well, to our old friend Kevin...
[01:06:21.280 --> 01:06:22.880]   Kevin Marks.
[01:06:22.880 --> 01:06:23.760]   What's the name of that?
[01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:24.320]   Indie Web.
[01:06:24.320 --> 01:06:24.880]   Indie Web.
[01:06:24.880 --> 01:06:25.360]   Indie Web.
[01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:25.920]   Indie Web.
[01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:26.320]   Indie Web.
[01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:26.720]   Indie Web.
[01:06:26.720 --> 01:06:27.200]   Okay, yes.
[01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:30.400]   Where that's the architecture that he's been proposing,
[01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:32.240]   urban, been implementing for ages,
[01:06:32.240 --> 01:06:33.360]   which is you should be able to...
[01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:36.000]   And David Weiner is the same on this.
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:36.480]   Yeah.
[01:06:36.480 --> 01:06:39.280]   You should be able to write once post-multiple.
[01:06:39.280 --> 01:06:41.280]   And of course, Facebook's not going to do that.
[01:06:41.280 --> 01:06:42.320]   Sub-stack's not going to do that.
[01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:44.240]   Nobody wants to facilitate you doing it.
[01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:47.120]   They may not require you exclusivity,
[01:06:47.120 --> 01:06:48.240]   but they don't want to make it too easy.
[01:06:48.240 --> 01:06:50.000]   Well, then you're not helping journalists.
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:50.320]   I know.
[01:06:50.320 --> 01:06:51.200]   Just marketing.
[01:06:51.200 --> 01:06:51.440]   Yeah.
[01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:53.440]   Like the Coleman Foundation for journalists.
[01:06:53.440 --> 01:06:53.680]   Right.
[01:06:53.680 --> 01:06:56.880]   They want to silo as much as they can.
[01:06:56.880 --> 01:06:58.720]   Because that's how they make money.
[01:06:58.720 --> 01:07:00.320]   I'm in the paid medium thing,
[01:07:00.320 --> 01:07:02.320]   for which I get about 40 bucks a month.
[01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:09.440]   But there's no mention there of doing it exclusively.
[01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:11.840]   That'll buy a lot of kachioi pepe.
[01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:12.880]   Yeah, it will.
[01:07:12.880 --> 01:07:13.680]   You sure will.
[01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:16.720]   Basically, they're buying you a lunch.
[01:07:16.720 --> 01:07:19.440]   Fat enough to get another shot.
[01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:19.680]   Yeah.
[01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:24.960]   Casey Newton, platformer.
[01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:27.840]   He's another example of a long time
[01:07:27.840 --> 01:07:32.480]   well-known blogger on big-name tech blogs
[01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:36.000]   who's gone on his own with something he calls
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:36.720]   platformer.
[01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:38.800]   I wonder what he's using.
[01:07:38.800 --> 01:07:40.000]   Is he using Substack?
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:41.760]   I bet he is.
[01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:42.240]   Oh, no.
[01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:44.800]   Maybe he's not.
[01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:47.440]   Maybe he's smart enough not to use anything.
[01:07:47.440 --> 01:07:50.240]   We have to use something.
[01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:52.320]   Well, I mean, yeah.
[01:07:52.320 --> 01:07:54.560]   So you're just going to create like an HTML email
[01:07:54.560 --> 01:07:55.360]   and just send it out.
[01:07:55.360 --> 01:07:56.320]   You can do that.
[01:07:56.320 --> 01:07:57.840]   Pull up your own server in the basement.
[01:07:57.840 --> 01:07:58.560]   Yeah.
[01:07:58.560 --> 01:08:01.120]   Yeah, it looks like Substack.
[01:08:01.120 --> 01:08:05.680]   So he has a piece on platformer most recently.
[01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:09.520]   Comparing the Facebook versus Substack.
[01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:13.520]   It's called what Facebook sees in newsletters.
[01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:16.880]   Hint, it's all about groups plus Substack fumbles.
[01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:20.560]   So this is a response to that piece.
[01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:23.680]   I just, the Campbell Brown piece I just told you about.
[01:08:23.680 --> 01:08:26.000]   He says, let's see.
[01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:29.600]   I find Facebook's moving in newsletters a bit surreal,
[01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:33.280]   if only because I started a newsletter in 2017
[01:08:33.280 --> 01:08:38.000]   as an end run around Facebook or rather as an end run
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.320]   around the idea of algorithmic feeds in general.
[01:08:40.320 --> 01:08:43.440]   That's an interesting point.
[01:08:43.440 --> 01:08:44.400]   Yeah, essentially point.
[01:08:44.400 --> 01:08:45.920]   After the better part of a decade,
[01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:48.720]   chasing audiences from platform to platform,
[01:08:48.720 --> 01:08:50.400]   kind of your strategy, Stacey.
[01:08:50.400 --> 01:08:52.800]   I set out to build a strong direct connection
[01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:55.120]   to an audience that wants to hear from me.
[01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:58.000]   And that's what you've got now, Stacey, on your own site.
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:01.360]   And that I can reliably reach no matter how many likes,
[01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:05.120]   upvotes or retweets any individual post happens to get.
[01:09:05.120 --> 01:09:07.680]   I'll read between the lines and what he's saying is,
[01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:10.640]   Facebook's algorithm determines how many eyeballs
[01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:13.360]   you get based on upvotes or likes.
[01:09:13.360 --> 01:09:15.600]   And he just wants to have a platform
[01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:17.040]   where everybody who comes to that platform
[01:09:17.040 --> 01:09:19.040]   is going to read all the stuff he writes.
[01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:20.160]   No algorithm here.
[01:09:20.160 --> 01:09:24.000]   He says, I won't rehearse Facebook's long history
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:24.960]   with the news business.
[01:09:24.960 --> 01:09:27.200]   It's been rocky and mostly unsatisfying
[01:09:27.200 --> 01:09:29.600]   for just about everyone involved.
[01:09:29.600 --> 01:09:39.920]   I'm just trying to see if there's a conclusion here.
[01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:40.400]   Point.
[01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:42.000]   Yeah, I have to say,
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:43.440]   this is the second time I've read through this,
[01:09:43.440 --> 01:09:45.360]   and I have had a little trouble finding his point.
[01:09:45.360 --> 01:09:46.160]   I did too.
[01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:46.640]   I did too.
[01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:49.520]   There's been criticism of some stack
[01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:52.880]   that we don't know who their pain or the deal is.
[01:09:52.880 --> 01:09:55.360]   So I just put this on the rundown below that.
[01:09:55.360 --> 01:09:59.040]   He does raise the before we move on.
[01:09:59.040 --> 01:09:59.440]   Sure.
[01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:00.880]   He does raise the point.
[01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:03.280]   I do wonder how committed Facebook
[01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:05.200]   will be to these creators in the long term.
[01:10:05.200 --> 01:10:09.760]   Because the reason people don't like Facebook
[01:10:09.760 --> 01:10:13.360]   is because the platform changes all the time,
[01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:15.440]   making it a shaky ground on which to build a business,
[01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:16.960]   which we have been exactly saying.
[01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:21.360]   So you got to question their motivations and maybe--
[01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:23.520]   I think it depends on where this is coming from.
[01:10:23.520 --> 01:10:24.960]   If this is coming from profit,
[01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:27.200]   then the rug is there already pulled out.
[01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:28.400]   If this is coming from--
[01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:29.760]   let's do something nice from journalists,
[01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:30.800]   maybe they'll be nicer to us,
[01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:32.800]   then there's probably a budget behind it,
[01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:34.240]   and it'll last as long as that budget lasts.
[01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:36.080]   And I don't know what you're doing.
[01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:36.560]   So, yes.
[01:10:36.560 --> 01:10:38.320]   So don't count on it either way.
[01:10:38.320 --> 01:10:40.640]   Yeah, no, don't count anybody.
[01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:42.880]   He does use an example of Heather Cox Richardson,
[01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:45.280]   the most successful individual on sub stack.
[01:10:45.280 --> 01:10:48.960]   She makes a million dollars in revenue each year.
[01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:51.440]   But he also says most of her subscribers
[01:10:51.440 --> 01:10:53.040]   come over her Facebook page,
[01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:55.200]   page which has 1.1 million followers.
[01:10:55.200 --> 01:10:57.360]   I mean, maybe that's a good use of it.
[01:10:57.360 --> 01:10:58.000]   Is to use Facebook.
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:10:58.960]   I think that is the way to do this.
[01:10:58.960 --> 01:10:59.840]   As publicity.
[01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:01.440]   That is the way to drive people.
[01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:03.600]   You should control your emails.
[01:11:03.600 --> 01:11:05.760]   And also, her audience is--
[01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:09.680]   I mean, LinkedIn is a great place for me,
[01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:12.400]   actually, to get new subscribers and find an audience.
[01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:12.720]   All better.
[01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:13.360]   Because I write--
[01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:14.080]   Perfect.
[01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:16.160]   About business, I am correct.
[01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:16.800]   Thank you, Jeff.
[01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:20.240]   LinkedIn was great for me to get work.
[01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:22.880]   If you're--
[01:11:22.880 --> 01:11:25.840]   Yeah, someone like her, and it's a little bit more general interest,
[01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:28.240]   then Facebook does make a lot more sense.
[01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:33.040]   If I were sub stack--
[01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:38.400]   Let me read the last two paragraphs from--
[01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:40.560]   this is again, Casey Newton's platformer--
[01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:44.320]   "admits all this sub stack CEO Chris Best tweeted
[01:11:44.320 --> 01:11:46.560]   without any other context, quote,
[01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:49.920]   "defund the thought police," end quote.
[01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:53.440]   "Same me decide with the platform's most lucrative edge
[01:11:53.440 --> 01:11:55.840]   lords over its more centrist and liberal creators."
[01:11:55.840 --> 01:11:58.080]   I've since received a few inquiries from writers
[01:11:58.080 --> 01:12:00.560]   asking whether being associated with sub stack
[01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:03.200]   will damage their reputations over the long term.
[01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:06.320]   Because the question is, who is sub stack--
[01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:08.240]   you know, sub stack has-- has--
[01:12:08.240 --> 01:12:10.240]   Bannon is one of the two's letters.
[01:12:10.240 --> 01:12:12.320]   Right, who are they paying for?
[01:12:12.320 --> 01:12:14.480]   And whose company are you keeping there?
[01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:16.000]   And if you don't know--
[01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:19.120]   So that's why the next line has something to say,
[01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:21.600]   put up where they're still not being terribly forthcoming.
[01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:23.360]   They've said that more than 30 writers
[01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:26.640]   have signed the Pro Deals, the whole bunch of issues,
[01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:28.000]   but you don't know who you're next to.
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:29.760]   So sub stack, which has a model--
[01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:34.400]   it's a newsletter platform, and the model is you could charge,
[01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:36.240]   and you make money, and they take a cut.
[01:12:36.240 --> 01:12:38.320]   Except that to jumpstart it.
[01:12:38.320 --> 01:12:41.920]   We now know they funded a group, you say 30--
[01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:42.400]   30--
[01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:42.880]   30--
[01:12:42.880 --> 01:12:46.880]   --big name types by saying here.
[01:12:46.880 --> 01:12:47.920]   Maybe you have-- there's one of them.
[01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:48.960]   Here's money.
[01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:50.880]   Come to sub stack and write.
[01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:52.400]   And that makes sense to--
[01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:54.880]   I think Ev did that with Medium, right, at the beginning,
[01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:57.440]   to kind of generate traffic in the beginning.
[01:12:57.440 --> 01:12:58.160]   He says--
[01:12:58.160 --> 01:12:59.680]   Casey Newton says, "If I were sub stack,
[01:12:59.680 --> 01:13:01.840]   I would take pains to demonstrate
[01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:04.320]   that the platform offers financial support
[01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:07.040]   to creators across the political spectrum
[01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:10.720]   and draws hard lines around targeted harassment and bigotry.
[01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:14.080]   Tough to do if Bannon is one of your contributors.
[01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:16.800]   I would hire a really good head of communications,
[01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:20.240]   give her the passwords to the Fafter's Twitter accounts."
[01:13:20.240 --> 01:13:23.920]   In other words, stop defunding the thought place.
[01:13:23.920 --> 01:13:26.480]   "I would lean all the way away from culture," Warren toured.
[01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:29.280]   But do you think that Chris Best of sub stack
[01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:32.880]   is a canceled culture guy that he's wooing the right?
[01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:33.360]   No idea.
[01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:36.080]   That's kind of what Casey's implying here.
[01:13:36.080 --> 01:13:37.120]   That he's--
[01:13:37.120 --> 01:13:38.320]   He's lying it, but I don't know.
[01:13:38.320 --> 01:13:40.400]   He's wooing the right.
[01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:41.120]   Maybe that--
[01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:42.400]   Well, you know what?
[01:13:42.400 --> 01:13:43.440]   I said this last week.
[01:13:43.440 --> 01:13:46.560]   Talk radio after Rush Limbaugh realized,
[01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:48.000]   "Hey, you want a big audience?
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:49.760]   Swing right.
[01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:51.120]   That's the audience.
[01:13:51.120 --> 01:13:52.720]   Liberals are so namby-pamby,
[01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:54.000]   they don't make good talk radio."
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.560]   Well, they also--
[01:13:56.560 --> 01:13:56.960]   Liberals--
[01:13:56.960 --> 01:13:59.440]   The whole world is your oyster,
[01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:00.240]   if you're a liberal,
[01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:03.760]   in the sense that you look and listen everywhere.
[01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:04.320]   Right?
[01:14:04.320 --> 01:14:06.800]   But if you're a marginalized viewpoint,
[01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:08.160]   or you feel under attack,
[01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:12.560]   there are fewer places if you believe in that.
[01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:13.280]   You know?
[01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:16.880]   And so I think that's one of the reasons why
[01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:20.640]   conservative and having a conservative bent
[01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:23.040]   and does so well for these people.
[01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:24.880]   Well, that's the story that conservatives
[01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:26.800]   probably get out of.
[01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:28.480]   It's true that the media is liberal.
[01:14:28.480 --> 01:14:29.040]   But the media is not attacking.
[01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:30.240]   Well, the media is not--
[01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:30.800]   Well, the media is not--
[01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:33.040]   I'm not saying it that way.
[01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:34.000]   I'm saying it that--
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:37.360]   My viewpoint embraces
[01:14:37.360 --> 01:14:39.600]   any number of--
[01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:42.880]   Like, I can read a bunch of books and not be offended, right?
[01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:45.360]   I can watch a lot of television and not be offended.
[01:14:45.360 --> 01:14:47.600]   But can you read Dr. Seuss and not be offended?
[01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:48.880]   Yes.
[01:14:48.880 --> 01:14:49.600]   But if you're--
[01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:50.000]   If you're--
[01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:53.360]   If there's so many things that offend you,
[01:14:53.360 --> 01:14:56.560]   you're automatically narrowing your options.
[01:14:56.560 --> 01:14:57.920]   And so to find something--
[01:14:57.920 --> 01:14:58.960]   Yeah.
[01:14:58.960 --> 01:15:00.480]   Do you see it--
[01:15:00.480 --> 01:15:01.200]   I would define--
[01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:02.240]   I would say it--
[01:15:02.240 --> 01:15:03.920]   I would say it same thing the opposite way,
[01:15:03.920 --> 01:15:05.760]   which is one of the reasons
[01:15:05.760 --> 01:15:10.720]   conservative talk radio does better than liberal talk radio
[01:15:10.720 --> 01:15:13.040]   is because it's the radio resentment.
[01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:15.200]   And it's the radio--
[01:15:15.200 --> 01:15:15.760]   Oh, yeah.
[01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:17.360]   It's the yes--
[01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:19.200]   Because really, look at Ron Johnson
[01:15:19.200 --> 01:15:22.960]   has gone now on every major news medium to say,
[01:15:22.960 --> 01:15:24.000]   "I've been canceled."
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:25.200]   It's like, "No, you haven't.
[01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:28.640]   You've just appeared everywhere
[01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:30.080]   to announce that you've been canceled."
[01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:30.880]   Oh, no, yeah.
[01:15:30.880 --> 01:15:32.400]   It's the opposite.
[01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:35.360]   But that whining resentment--
[01:15:35.360 --> 01:15:37.440]   And they're out to get us and all that stuff--
[01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:38.720]   plays really well.
[01:15:39.280 --> 01:15:41.360]   And it makes a much more interesting talk radio
[01:15:41.360 --> 01:15:43.200]   than, you know,
[01:15:43.200 --> 01:15:45.600]   "Hey, we all need to get along,
[01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:48.000]   and let's solve our problems."
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:48.560]   That's so bad.
[01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:50.720]   So if newspapers are inherently liberal
[01:15:50.720 --> 01:15:53.200]   and talk radio is inherently conservative,
[01:15:53.200 --> 01:15:54.800]   is the internet inherently anything?
[01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:56.400]   No, no, no.
[01:15:56.400 --> 01:15:58.320]   It serves both equally,
[01:15:58.320 --> 01:16:00.640]   any more than electricity is anything.
[01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:04.480]   It's a neutral medium, I think.
[01:16:04.480 --> 01:16:05.440]   Well, when we hear people saying
[01:16:05.440 --> 01:16:07.040]   the social media is inherently--
[01:16:07.040 --> 01:16:08.000]   Right.
[01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:09.520]   Well, we hear both.
[01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:12.000]   We hear social media is inherently right-wing,
[01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:12.640]   because that's what they push,
[01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:13.600]   because they can't some traffic.
[01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:15.200]   On the other hand, we hear the right say,
[01:16:15.200 --> 01:16:16.560]   "But they'll cancel us."
[01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:17.360]   So you don't know what--
[01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:19.120]   Yeah, but the right has always been
[01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:20.560]   the party of persecution.
[01:16:20.560 --> 01:16:20.880]   I mean--
[01:16:20.880 --> 01:16:21.440]   Oh, yes.
[01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:22.800]   Look at the war on Christmas.
[01:16:22.800 --> 01:16:24.640]   So, I mean, this is just--
[01:16:24.640 --> 01:16:25.520]   Yeah, it plays well.
[01:16:25.520 --> 01:16:26.240]   And so I would--
[01:16:26.240 --> 01:16:27.120]   It really works well.
[01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:28.800]   If you tell--
[01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:32.640]   I mean, in its simplest form,
[01:16:32.640 --> 01:16:34.160]   if you tell your audience you're smart
[01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:35.360]   and everybody else is dumb,
[01:16:35.360 --> 01:16:36.160]   they're going to like you.
[01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:39.280]   If you tell your audience,
[01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:41.360]   those dummies are out to get us,
[01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:43.520]   you know, we're on a team together.
[01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:45.200]   It's a great way to build an audience.
[01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:47.600]   It's probably the best way to build an audience.
[01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:48.000]   Let's--
[01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:50.320]   You're on our team.
[01:16:50.320 --> 01:16:51.920]   You know, go Clemson.
[01:16:51.920 --> 01:16:52.640]   It's a cult.
[01:16:52.640 --> 01:16:53.200]   Hmm.
[01:16:53.200 --> 01:16:54.320]   That's not even a cult.
[01:16:54.320 --> 01:16:54.880]   I mean, take note.
[01:16:54.880 --> 01:16:56.080]   That's not even a cult.
[01:16:56.080 --> 01:16:56.640]   Idiots.
[01:16:56.640 --> 01:16:57.440]   Yeah.
[01:16:57.440 --> 01:16:58.560]   That's not even a cult.
[01:16:58.560 --> 01:16:59.520]   That doesn't have to be a cult.
[01:16:59.520 --> 01:17:02.240]   I mean, would you say Clemson supporters are a cult?
[01:17:02.240 --> 01:17:03.440]   No, they love Clemson.
[01:17:03.440 --> 01:17:04.240]   Right.
[01:17:04.240 --> 01:17:06.400]   And they love Clemson.
[01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:07.600]   Kill for it.
[01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:08.960]   By hating everybody else,
[01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:11.120]   by hating all the other non-clemsons, right?
[01:17:11.120 --> 01:17:13.840]   In the case of college football,
[01:17:13.840 --> 01:17:14.560]   it doesn't matter.
[01:17:14.560 --> 01:17:15.040]   It's fun.
[01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:15.520]   Right.
[01:17:15.520 --> 01:17:16.080]   It's a game.
[01:17:16.080 --> 01:17:19.120]   When it comes to humans and real life,
[01:17:19.120 --> 01:17:21.200]   maybe it's not so much fun or so much of a game,
[01:17:21.200 --> 01:17:23.600]   but it has the same appeal,
[01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:26.240]   has the same visceral,
[01:17:26.240 --> 01:17:27.280]   yeah, those guys,
[01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:29.120]   those are the bad guys.
[01:17:29.120 --> 01:17:30.000]   We're the good guys.
[01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:30.880]   We're the smart ones.
[01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:33.440]   Nobody wants to get this done.
[01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:34.000]   Give me one more point about--
[01:17:35.200 --> 01:17:36.720]   about marketing with this stuff,
[01:17:36.720 --> 01:17:37.520]   which I just--
[01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:40.160]   so under the post I put up about what--
[01:17:40.160 --> 01:17:43.040]   some stacks said in response.
[01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:43.920]   Matt Keyser,
[01:17:43.920 --> 01:17:45.360]   I don't know if you've seen his newsletter.
[01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:48.160]   It's called What the F Just Happened Today.
[01:17:48.160 --> 01:17:48.560]   Yes.
[01:17:48.560 --> 01:17:49.600]   That he did it for four weeks.
[01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:49.920]   Yes.
[01:17:49.920 --> 01:17:51.040]   He's a former student of mine.
[01:17:51.040 --> 01:17:51.520]   Oh.
[01:17:51.520 --> 01:17:52.160]   Good guy.
[01:17:52.160 --> 01:17:53.520]   He's in Seattle, by the way, I think.
[01:17:53.520 --> 01:17:54.000]   Stacey.
[01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:54.560]   Good guy.
[01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:58.640]   So he said Twitter doesn't do anything for his newsletter.
[01:17:58.640 --> 01:18:00.720]   He has six figure income,
[01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:02.160]   which he talks about from his newsletter.
[01:18:02.160 --> 01:18:05.120]   He said email to email sharing is extremely powerful.
[01:18:05.120 --> 01:18:08.080]   Since it's the only interoperable social media platform.
[01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:10.800]   Which I found really interesting.
[01:18:10.800 --> 01:18:11.920]   Say that again.
[01:18:11.920 --> 01:18:12.960]   Say that again.
[01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:15.120]   Email to email sharing is extremely powerful.
[01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:17.920]   Since it's the only interoperable social media platform.
[01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:19.360]   That email--
[01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:19.840]   It's true.
[01:18:19.840 --> 01:18:20.800]   And unfortunate.
[01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:24.000]   But it's only because nobody else wants to be interoperable.
[01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:25.280]   Every else wants to be siloed,
[01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:26.080]   but I agree 100%.
[01:18:26.080 --> 01:18:26.880]   Right.
[01:18:26.880 --> 01:18:28.240]   Email was not--
[01:18:28.240 --> 01:18:29.520]   remember, you're old enough.
[01:18:29.520 --> 01:18:31.360]   I'm old enough.
[01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:32.240]   Remember before--
[01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:33.280]   MCI mail.
[01:18:33.280 --> 01:18:34.880]   Before email was interoperable.
[01:18:34.880 --> 01:18:36.080]   You were on MCI mail.
[01:18:36.080 --> 01:18:38.240]   You couldn't email anybody on GE mail.
[01:18:38.240 --> 01:18:40.400]   And that was nuts.
[01:18:40.400 --> 01:18:42.560]   But once they figured out making it interoperable,
[01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:43.840]   nothing could stop it.
[01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:46.240]   It's the exact opposite lesson that Twitter and Facebook
[01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:47.280]   and everybody else is having.
[01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:50.640]   Although maybe Jack has finally got the message
[01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:52.160]   since he's proposing this
[01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:55.280]   moderated blue sky format.
[01:18:55.280 --> 01:18:57.200]   I don't know.
[01:18:57.200 --> 01:19:00.160]   But I still buy into the idea that
[01:19:00.160 --> 01:19:04.320]   your people are going to be wherever you are.
[01:19:04.320 --> 01:19:06.240]   It's not necessarily saying that
[01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:09.840]   the newsletter is the best way to go.
[01:19:09.840 --> 01:19:12.080]   Because it may not be the best way to go for you.
[01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:13.360]   It may be Twitter.
[01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:15.200]   It may be medium.
[01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:21.520]   And the way I see people keep throwing these big old claims out of the--
[01:19:21.520 --> 01:19:23.280]   Hey, this is it.
[01:19:23.280 --> 01:19:27.680]   Because I'm making six figures with using this type of methodology.
[01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:28.880]   That's not always the case.
[01:19:28.880 --> 01:19:32.400]   Some people, it just doesn't stick on that platform.
[01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:36.080]   There are reasons you have YouTubers that aren't necessarily--
[01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:37.520]   Do you think it's platform-specific?
[01:19:37.520 --> 01:19:39.120]   It's like the culture of the platform
[01:19:39.120 --> 01:19:40.880]   determines who's going to make it on that platform.
[01:19:40.880 --> 01:19:43.440]   I think it's just whoever your audience is.
[01:19:43.440 --> 01:19:47.280]   Ms. Stacy was mentioning previously about LinkedIn.
[01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:49.920]   I remember a couple of years ago,
[01:19:49.920 --> 01:19:53.760]   telling my little tiny circle of friends that I enjoy LinkedIn.
[01:19:53.760 --> 01:19:55.680]   Because LinkedIn got me work.
[01:19:55.680 --> 01:19:59.280]   And I'm not talking about just being able to put a resume out there.
[01:19:59.280 --> 01:20:03.920]   But if I wanted to have a gig to go shoot something for some people locally,
[01:20:03.920 --> 01:20:06.320]   LinkedIn is where I got all of my leads.
[01:20:06.320 --> 01:20:07.920]   It wasn't Twitter.
[01:20:07.920 --> 01:20:09.040]   It wasn't Instagram.
[01:20:09.040 --> 01:20:10.080]   It wasn't Flickr.
[01:20:10.080 --> 01:20:11.600]   It was LinkedIn.
[01:20:11.600 --> 01:20:12.080]   But it didn't--
[01:20:12.080 --> 01:20:13.120]   I would have thought LinkedIn for you.
[01:20:13.120 --> 01:20:13.680]   That's interesting.
[01:20:13.680 --> 01:20:14.160]   Yep.
[01:20:14.160 --> 01:20:14.480]   Yep.
[01:20:14.480 --> 01:20:16.480]   But it doesn't work that way for everybody.
[01:20:16.480 --> 01:20:17.200]   Yes.
[01:20:17.200 --> 01:20:18.240]   Yeah.
[01:20:18.240 --> 01:20:21.840]   And some people have great success on YouTube, and many of us don't.
[01:20:21.840 --> 01:20:24.000]   Yep.
[01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:25.120]   That would be me, sir.
[01:20:25.120 --> 01:20:26.480]   Rich.
[01:20:26.480 --> 01:20:28.720]   I think you're doing all right.
[01:20:28.720 --> 01:20:29.520]   The don't.
[01:20:29.520 --> 01:20:29.760]   The don'ts.
[01:20:29.760 --> 01:20:30.000]   OK.
[01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:32.880]   Yeah, that might be cultural.
[01:20:32.880 --> 01:20:33.280]   I don't know.
[01:20:33.280 --> 01:20:35.120]   I mean, that's the big problem, right?
[01:20:35.120 --> 01:20:41.040]   If you have a group of fans, Kevin Kelly says all you need is a thousand.
[01:20:41.040 --> 01:20:41.840]   I don't know if that's true.
[01:20:41.840 --> 01:20:43.440]   But if you have a group of fans--
[01:20:43.440 --> 01:20:44.720]   I actually agree with that.
[01:20:44.720 --> 01:20:44.880]   Yeah.
[01:20:44.880 --> 01:20:45.920]   But that's not the problem.
[01:20:45.920 --> 01:20:47.680]   The problem is how do you get more?
[01:20:47.680 --> 01:20:51.120]   And how do you get discovered?
[01:20:51.120 --> 01:20:52.000]   How do you get growth?
[01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:57.280]   And you're saying the right platform is different,
[01:20:57.280 --> 01:21:00.000]   depending on who you are and what your content is and that kind of thing.
[01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:02.640]   You got to choose the right place to find back growth.
[01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:04.000]   Yeah, I had to find where my--
[01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:08.000]   I hate saying this phrase, but it's where my tribe is.
[01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:08.400]   Right.
[01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:10.800]   And most of my tribe is on Twitter.
[01:21:10.800 --> 01:21:14.000]   And also on LinkedIn.
[01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:14.640]   Is that true for you?
[01:21:14.640 --> 01:21:15.520]   It's @toostacie.
[01:21:15.520 --> 01:21:16.640]   Twitter.
[01:21:16.640 --> 01:21:19.680]   Well, that's where I'm at.
[01:21:19.680 --> 01:21:22.080]   So I get requests.
[01:21:22.080 --> 01:21:24.640]   So I'm on Twitter.
[01:21:24.640 --> 01:21:26.240]   So most people find me there.
[01:21:26.240 --> 01:21:29.600]   And then LinkedIn is where I get most of my growth from.
[01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:30.400]   Oh, interesting.
[01:21:30.400 --> 01:21:31.440]   So like just like Ant.
[01:21:31.440 --> 01:21:35.760]   Yeah, we've done Facebook-y, like, add things.
[01:21:35.760 --> 01:21:39.840]   But-- and we got some, but most of those people weren't sticky.
[01:21:39.840 --> 01:21:44.480]   So I think that's probably the right.
[01:21:44.480 --> 01:21:49.440]   I go where my audience is, but I also go where people are interested in talking.
[01:21:49.440 --> 01:21:52.000]   And I find out as much as I can.
[01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:53.680]   And again, my audience is business.
[01:21:53.680 --> 01:21:55.360]   So it's kind of not hard.
[01:21:55.360 --> 01:21:58.640]   I get a lot of requests to be on YouTube, but I am not.
[01:21:58.640 --> 01:22:02.880]   I have-- it's all a mystery to me.
[01:22:02.880 --> 01:22:04.880]   I can't figure it out at all.
[01:22:04.880 --> 01:22:07.680]   I'm just glad I had a cable television show back in the day.
[01:22:07.680 --> 01:22:08.480]   That's all I know.
[01:22:08.480 --> 01:22:11.920]   It's just dumb freaking luck.
[01:22:11.920 --> 01:22:18.880]   I mean, I really do wish I don't have much faith in marketing at all.
[01:22:20.480 --> 01:22:24.480]   Well, see, I won't say that because I do believe in marketing yourself.
[01:22:24.480 --> 01:22:29.440]   Well, it makes sense in the premise of it, but I don't know how to do it.
[01:22:29.440 --> 01:22:31.600]   I don't know how to do it either.
[01:22:31.600 --> 01:22:35.200]   I'm not saying I know how, but I'm going to keep trying something.
[01:22:35.200 --> 01:22:40.560]   Yeah, well, and that's-- I mean, I don't know.
[01:22:40.560 --> 01:22:44.880]   I tweet about my stuff or I post it on LinkedIn and then I'm like, "Oh, look, that worked."
[01:22:44.880 --> 01:22:45.680]   Or--
[01:22:45.680 --> 01:22:49.520]   Yeah, I feel like if I can't be a cheerleader for myself,
[01:22:49.520 --> 01:22:53.840]   how can I expect anyone else to be a cheerleader for me if I don't even believe in myself?
[01:22:53.840 --> 01:22:55.840]   I just want to go home and play with my computers.
[01:22:55.840 --> 01:22:58.800]   You have a walking inspirational t-shirt.
[01:22:58.800 --> 01:22:59.520]   Yeah, he is.
[01:22:59.520 --> 01:23:01.680]   He is using me.
[01:23:01.680 --> 01:23:02.080]   I love it.
[01:23:02.080 --> 01:23:05.520]   You know, Ant could be the soft-spoken Gary V.
[01:23:05.520 --> 01:23:07.760]   Oh, no.
[01:23:07.760 --> 01:23:09.360]   He could inspire people.
[01:23:09.360 --> 01:23:11.280]   Is that a contradiction in terms, though?
[01:23:11.280 --> 01:23:13.040]   A soft-spoken drive?
[01:23:13.040 --> 01:23:14.000]   He tries to be inspired.
[01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:15.760]   He could inspire people without yelling at them.
[01:23:15.760 --> 01:23:16.000]   Yeah.
[01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:18.080]   Let's take a little--
[01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:21.440]   My kids get yelled at enough, so that's where I'm going.
[01:23:21.440 --> 01:23:24.320]   Hard heads, get over here.
[01:23:24.320 --> 01:23:25.360]   Hard heads.
[01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:26.320]   And over here.
[01:23:26.320 --> 01:23:28.080]   You call them hard heads with love.
[01:23:28.080 --> 01:23:29.280]   That's right.
[01:23:29.280 --> 01:23:30.000]   With love.
[01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:32.240]   Is there an origin story to the hard heads?
[01:23:32.240 --> 01:23:34.320]   Are you willing to say it?
[01:23:34.320 --> 01:23:36.800]   It's pretty much how I grew up.
[01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:42.160]   Everyone in my childhood, if you were a child, you were a hard head.
[01:23:42.160 --> 01:23:44.720]   No, I don't care what parents said it.
[01:23:44.720 --> 01:23:46.640]   I don't care what adult it was.
[01:23:47.120 --> 01:23:50.400]   In the neighborhood, everybody called the children hard heads.
[01:23:50.400 --> 01:23:54.240]   Not just my parents, not just my grandparents.
[01:23:54.240 --> 01:23:56.000]   The neighbors called us hard heads.
[01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:59.120]   You know, it's just what it was.
[01:23:59.120 --> 01:24:00.880]   Is that the town or is that regional?
[01:24:00.880 --> 01:24:03.840]   I think it was just my town, I guess.
[01:24:03.840 --> 01:24:04.400]   It's your town.
[01:24:04.400 --> 01:24:09.200]   My mom and Papa called my dad and us hard head.
[01:24:09.200 --> 01:24:10.160]   Oh, really?
[01:24:10.160 --> 01:24:11.840]   Not hard heads like in this group,
[01:24:11.840 --> 01:24:14.960]   but that was a common descriptor for us as children.
[01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:18.880]   Like shorty or hard head.
[01:24:18.880 --> 01:24:21.120]   Hard heads and youngens.
[01:24:21.120 --> 01:24:21.760]   Youngens.
[01:24:21.760 --> 01:24:23.120]   Youngens, I know.
[01:24:23.120 --> 01:24:23.840]   Youngens, sure.
[01:24:23.840 --> 01:24:27.680]   Yoots, as Joe Pesci would call them.
[01:24:27.680 --> 01:24:30.160]   I think that was northern.
[01:24:30.160 --> 01:24:33.920]   I want to do a new segment of this show called "Breathe with Ant."
[01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:37.920]   I'm going to tape my math up.
[01:24:37.920 --> 01:24:40.560]   We're going to get a new sponsor for that too, right?
[01:24:41.440 --> 01:24:42.880]   [laughter]
[01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:47.360]   Um, moving on to segment four.
[01:24:47.360 --> 01:24:47.840]   I don't know.
[01:24:47.840 --> 01:24:48.880]   I'm going to give this up now.
[01:24:48.880 --> 01:24:55.440]   Instagram, this is in the department of what you mean they allowed that?
[01:24:55.440 --> 01:24:56.240]   Yeah.
[01:24:56.240 --> 01:25:01.120]   Instagram will no longer let adults message teens who don't follow them.
[01:25:01.120 --> 01:25:02.800]   What?
[01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:04.960]   Who the hell would have ever done that?
[01:25:04.960 --> 01:25:05.840]   They allowed that?
[01:25:07.520 --> 01:25:12.800]   Teen users will also be shown safety prompts when messaging suspicious adults.
[01:25:12.800 --> 01:25:14.640]   Yeah, like stop.
[01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:16.720]   What are you doing?
[01:25:16.720 --> 01:25:19.280]   That is just a suspicious adult.
[01:25:19.280 --> 01:25:20.960]   Why are you doing more than just that?
[01:25:20.960 --> 01:25:23.040]   Yeah, well, they're an adult suspicious.
[01:25:23.040 --> 01:25:23.600]   I don't know.
[01:25:23.600 --> 01:25:29.200]   Limiting new policies, limiting interactions between teenagers and adults
[01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:31.440]   to make its platform safer for young users.
[01:25:31.440 --> 01:25:34.320]   I mean, I guess, you know, yeah.
[01:25:35.920 --> 01:25:41.200]   Maybe they didn't want to admit they had so many young users or that it's a tool for grooming
[01:25:41.200 --> 01:25:41.840]   young people.
[01:25:41.840 --> 01:25:42.640]   Well, that's the thing.
[01:25:42.640 --> 01:25:43.840]   I would think so.
[01:25:43.840 --> 01:25:48.160]   So they'll be introducing safety responsibly shown to teams when they teens,
[01:25:48.160 --> 01:25:54.240]   when they direct message adults who have been, quote, exhibiting potentially suspicious behavior.
[01:25:54.240 --> 01:25:57.040]   Oh, this is gross.
[01:25:57.040 --> 01:25:59.280]   This is really positive.
[01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:01.040]   I'll see about the people that had to build that algorithm.
[01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:02.160]   Yeah.
[01:26:02.160 --> 01:26:07.520]   Yeah. The props will remind young users not to feel pressured to respond to messages
[01:26:07.520 --> 01:26:12.320]   and to be careful sharing photos, videos, or information with someone you don't know.
[01:26:12.320 --> 01:26:15.440]   If you have to do this on a platform, you've got a problem, I think.
[01:26:15.440 --> 01:26:19.120]   Well, people, I mean, people groom across platforms.
[01:26:19.120 --> 01:26:19.920]   I guess so.
[01:26:19.920 --> 01:26:21.760]   I mean, look at it when it was, you know, when I was...
[01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:22.480]   The Boy Scouts.
[01:26:22.480 --> 01:26:22.720]   Yeah.
[01:26:22.720 --> 01:26:25.280]   Look at AOL Instant Messenger.
[01:26:25.280 --> 01:26:29.600]   That was like, that was like the headquarters, all that stuff, right?
[01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:32.720]   Oh, that's right.
[01:26:32.720 --> 01:26:32.960]   Yeah.
[01:26:32.960 --> 01:26:34.800]   What did they say?
[01:26:34.800 --> 01:26:36.880]   Name, age, sex, name, sex, age.
[01:26:36.880 --> 01:26:41.440]   What was the thing you would type an essay or something and they would have to respond?
[01:26:41.440 --> 01:26:42.880]   I don't remember what the deal was.
[01:26:42.880 --> 01:26:46.000]   So scary.
[01:26:46.000 --> 01:26:46.560]   Yeah, it was scary.
[01:26:46.560 --> 01:26:47.200]   You know how I know?
[01:26:47.200 --> 01:26:51.520]   Because I was on a jury for one of those to catch a predator.
[01:26:51.520 --> 01:26:53.760]   You remember that show they did on Dateline to catch a predator?
[01:26:53.760 --> 01:26:54.240]   Oh, you were?
[01:26:54.240 --> 01:26:54.960]   Yeah.
[01:26:54.960 --> 01:26:59.040]   Because one of the houses that they used that entrapped people was here in Petaluma.
[01:26:59.840 --> 01:27:00.640]   So I was on a...
[01:27:00.640 --> 01:27:06.000]   It was a federal jury trying this guy, a Coast Guard guy, young himself.
[01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:13.520]   He was an early 20s, if not teen, who had been lured by an adult pretending to be a kid
[01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:15.040]   on AOL Instant Messenger.
[01:27:15.040 --> 01:27:19.200]   And they read us all the transcripts and everything.
[01:27:19.200 --> 01:27:20.720]   It was like, oh, it was so cringy.
[01:27:20.720 --> 01:27:25.440]   And we heard the whole prosecution case.
[01:27:27.200 --> 01:27:31.040]   And then at the end of the prosecution's case, the defense attorney goes up to the judge,
[01:27:31.040 --> 01:27:33.280]   goes, judge, move to dismiss.
[01:27:33.280 --> 01:27:35.360]   And the judge says, yes, absolutely.
[01:27:35.360 --> 01:27:36.240]   We're dismissing this case.
[01:27:36.240 --> 01:27:37.440]   That's this is entrapment.
[01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:39.440]   Thank you, jury.
[01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:40.080]   Goodbye.
[01:27:40.080 --> 01:27:41.520]   I never even got to hear the defense.
[01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:44.720]   They just they judge said, no, you entrapped this kid.
[01:27:44.720 --> 01:27:45.760]   Yeah.
[01:27:45.760 --> 01:27:48.960]   Because it wasn't a kid that was doing the messaging was an adult.
[01:27:48.960 --> 01:27:49.760]   Right.
[01:27:49.760 --> 01:27:52.560]   Age, sex, location, ASL.
[01:27:52.560 --> 01:27:53.280]   That's what it was.
[01:27:53.280 --> 01:27:55.360]   Yeah, ASL age, sex, location.
[01:27:56.320 --> 01:27:57.520]   American sign language.
[01:27:57.520 --> 01:28:00.720]   Creepy, creepy, creepy, creepy.
[01:28:00.720 --> 01:28:04.080]   And I guess it does make sense, especially, I don't know.
[01:28:04.080 --> 01:28:07.120]   I don't have Instagram, but Lisa does.
[01:28:07.120 --> 01:28:09.440]   And some of the stuff's on there is pretty sexy.
[01:28:09.440 --> 01:28:10.560]   They've gotten a little less.
[01:28:10.560 --> 01:28:14.400]   And I bet you there are teenagers on there who, you know, they're young.
[01:28:14.400 --> 01:28:15.280]   They don't know any better.
[01:28:15.280 --> 01:28:16.880]   They're putting sexy stuff on there.
[01:28:16.880 --> 01:28:20.160]   They're exploring their sexuality, which is fine.
[01:28:20.160 --> 01:28:20.640]   Right.
[01:28:20.640 --> 01:28:24.960]   But there's a bad bad people in there, bad men in there.
[01:28:25.920 --> 01:28:26.960]   Bad men must be.
[01:28:26.960 --> 01:28:32.320]   But there's also the camp that understands that if you're going to get impressions,
[01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:35.600]   likes, views, whatnot on Instagram, it takes a measure.
[01:28:35.600 --> 01:28:37.360]   It takes doing some edgy stuff.
[01:28:37.360 --> 01:28:38.160]   Yeah, you got shaky.
[01:28:38.160 --> 01:28:40.640]   It's why mine is pretty bland.
[01:28:40.640 --> 01:28:41.520]   Yeah.
[01:28:41.520 --> 01:28:46.560]   Yeah, that's not the medium for me or you.
[01:28:46.560 --> 01:28:49.440]   You look like five share in my work.
[01:28:49.440 --> 01:28:52.960]   I'm totally fine sharing my work there and sharing behind the scenes stuff.
[01:28:52.960 --> 01:28:57.200]   It's just I enjoy doing that because of the interaction there.
[01:28:57.200 --> 01:29:03.120]   Granted, there's more interaction on Twitter, but I still enjoy using Instagram from time to time,
[01:29:03.120 --> 01:29:06.640]   just to share what I've been working on and sharing some of my shots.
[01:29:06.640 --> 01:29:11.840]   But I'm not going to be like what I see in my feed most of the time.
[01:29:11.840 --> 01:29:17.920]   Here recently is just a bunch of selfies and a bunch of look at me's and a bunch of,
[01:29:17.920 --> 01:29:22.560]   you know, short skirts and interesting poses and things like that.
[01:29:22.560 --> 01:29:24.800]   But that's just not my personality.
[01:29:24.800 --> 01:29:29.920]   So this is a story that you're going to have to explain to me, somebody.
[01:29:29.920 --> 01:29:33.840]   The New York Times, the great Amazon flip-a-thon.
[01:29:33.840 --> 01:29:41.280]   You ever buy a product from EcoBaby or Trail Buddy or Quillity or Tape King?
[01:29:41.280 --> 01:29:46.720]   These are among the most popular in their categories on Amazon, according to the Times.
[01:29:46.720 --> 01:29:51.360]   Accounting for millions of dollars in yearly sales, they're all owned and operated by a single
[01:29:51.360 --> 01:29:59.440]   company, Thracio, which is one of dozens of firms snapping up successful Amazon brands for
[01:29:59.440 --> 01:30:00.480]   millions of dollars.
[01:30:00.480 --> 01:30:02.400]   There's lots of investment in these roll-ups, yes.
[01:30:02.400 --> 01:30:04.640]   I put this up here.
[01:30:04.640 --> 01:30:06.000]   Explain to me.
[01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:13.520]   So you decide to start the example they use here is the guy who wanted a better booster seat for dogs.
[01:30:13.520 --> 01:30:14.400]   Sure.
[01:30:14.400 --> 01:30:18.640]   And it doesn't matter where the product is, but the point, and we've known that we've
[01:30:18.640 --> 01:30:28.880]   talked a little years on the show, is that you can hire a designer, you can outsource the
[01:30:28.880 --> 01:30:34.080]   manufacturer, you can outsource the fulfillment of Amazon.
[01:30:34.080 --> 01:30:35.760]   It's a virtual company.
[01:30:35.760 --> 01:30:36.560]   It's a virtual company.
[01:30:36.560 --> 01:30:39.760]   You can be one person and you can have everything you need to create a product,
[01:30:39.760 --> 01:30:41.600]   as long as it works and you create it.
[01:30:41.600 --> 01:30:44.960]   Well, then you have some value because you now have some asset value,
[01:30:44.960 --> 01:30:48.960]   you have customers and you have ratings on Amazon and so on and so forth.
[01:30:48.960 --> 01:30:50.960]   So those little companies are getting bought up.
[01:30:50.960 --> 01:30:57.920]   I'm not sure about what the value of the roll-up is, except that the roll-up is even more virtual.
[01:30:57.920 --> 01:31:01.840]   Well, you only spent to the work of creating the doggy car seat.
[01:31:01.840 --> 01:31:05.200]   You did something, but we don't have to do anything.
[01:31:05.200 --> 01:31:08.240]   We're just going to roll up all these things and sell stuff on Amazon.
[01:31:08.240 --> 01:31:13.680]   According to this article, the way you make money is you raise money based on the roll-up.
[01:31:13.680 --> 01:31:18.640]   So you've created Thrasio, which created this conglomerate of eco-baby-trail-buddy
[01:31:18.640 --> 01:31:23.280]   quality and tape-king, has now raised $750 million in financing.
[01:31:23.280 --> 01:31:27.200]   So there's money in there somewhere.
[01:31:27.200 --> 01:31:28.480]   There's cash flow in there.
[01:31:28.480 --> 01:31:31.360]   Somewhere in this pile, there's a pony.
[01:31:31.360 --> 01:31:34.320]   Is this this week's NFT discussion?
[01:31:34.320 --> 01:31:35.600]   He's kind of like that, isn't it?
[01:31:35.600 --> 01:31:38.480]   It's amazing. It really is amazing.
[01:31:38.480 --> 01:31:41.040]   The world is changing so rapidly.
[01:31:41.040 --> 01:31:45.120]   But the quarantine has been huge for these companies.
[01:31:45.120 --> 01:31:50.560]   It also changes-- Amazon must love it, because of course, there's a lot of revenue passing through
[01:31:50.560 --> 01:31:51.040]   Amazon.
[01:31:51.040 --> 01:32:01.440]   I see on TikTok all the time, little TikToks on how to make millions of dollars on Amazon
[01:32:01.440 --> 01:32:10.000]   basically by going to Coles, buying up a bunch of clothes, taking the label, the price tag off,
[01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:11.680]   and flipping it on Amazon.
[01:32:11.680 --> 01:32:16.080]   I guess that's gone on forever since eBay.
[01:32:16.080 --> 01:32:17.040]   People would do that on eBay.
[01:32:17.040 --> 01:32:18.000]   That's correct.
[01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:21.760]   They buy a pallet of stuff at Costco and sell it one by one and profit.
[01:32:21.760 --> 01:32:27.680]   If you got the time, well, and especially with lots of people out of work,
[01:32:27.680 --> 01:32:31.760]   around where you're employed, this is the way to-- I think this is the modern--
[01:32:31.760 --> 01:32:33.440]   This is the great American dream now.
[01:32:33.440 --> 01:32:39.920]   Well, even in the media business, so I have a community of practice for commerce
[01:32:39.920 --> 01:32:43.280]   in media trying to get them to have more amateur streams.
[01:32:43.280 --> 01:32:52.160]   One company had created their own heavy blanket and made a lot of money on it.
[01:32:52.160 --> 01:32:52.960]   A lot.
[01:32:52.960 --> 01:32:54.000]   Like a weighted blanket?
[01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:55.280]   Yeah, weighted blanket.
[01:32:55.280 --> 01:32:57.840]   And now Casper sells them.
[01:32:57.840 --> 01:33:00.720]   What's going on?
[01:33:00.720 --> 01:33:02.880]   Guns are-- I'm tempted.
[01:33:02.880 --> 01:33:03.280]   I don't know.
[01:33:03.280 --> 01:33:05.200]   Would I like a heavy blanket?
[01:33:05.200 --> 01:33:06.400]   Especially if my mouth is tickled.
[01:33:06.400 --> 01:33:07.440]   Do not have a weighted blanket.
[01:33:07.440 --> 01:33:09.360]   They're amazing.
[01:33:10.320 --> 01:33:15.840]   It seems like I'm headed towards some sort of bizarre fantasy.
[01:33:15.840 --> 01:33:17.120]   Leo can't get up.
[01:33:17.120 --> 01:33:17.360]   I can't--
[01:33:17.360 --> 01:33:22.880]   The matter has a trap to eat the heavy blanket and he can't scream because his mouth is taped closed.
[01:33:22.880 --> 01:33:26.320]   I think--
[01:33:26.320 --> 01:33:28.320]   Like his two damn heavy and I can't yell.
[01:33:28.320 --> 01:33:28.880]   I think it's amazing.
[01:33:28.880 --> 01:33:33.520]   So the guy with the dog seat, it's actually an instructive story.
[01:33:33.520 --> 01:33:34.880]   He thought this is a good category.
[01:33:34.880 --> 01:33:37.760]   He looked on Amazon to research and noticed in the reviews,
[01:33:37.760 --> 01:33:40.000]   they were all for small dogs and they were flimsy.
[01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:42.720]   So he said, hmm, he actually did some effort.
[01:33:42.720 --> 01:33:46.400]   He went to trade shows and stuff and he found and made--
[01:33:46.400 --> 01:33:51.760]   You know, he went to actually the China and important export fair in Guangzhou
[01:33:51.760 --> 01:33:56.880]   and found a well-made car booster seat for dogs.
[01:33:56.880 --> 01:34:02.080]   Actually, maybe not, but he found a supplier who could make something better.
[01:34:02.080 --> 01:34:02.640]   Make it better.
[01:34:02.640 --> 01:34:03.040]   Yeah.
[01:34:03.040 --> 01:34:05.760]   He went to a factory anyway, on and on.
[01:34:05.760 --> 01:34:09.680]   He eventually flipped this business for six figures,
[01:34:09.680 --> 01:34:15.360]   low six figures, to an individual investor interested in using his steady stream of income.
[01:34:15.360 --> 01:34:18.160]   Which is like buying a deli so you can just get the money.
[01:34:18.160 --> 01:34:18.400]   Yeah.
[01:34:18.400 --> 01:34:19.200]   Or--
[01:34:19.200 --> 01:34:19.200]   Yeah.
[01:34:19.200 --> 01:34:21.360]   Oh, oh, this is something--
[01:34:21.360 --> 01:34:23.200]   Yes, this is a thing that happens.
[01:34:23.200 --> 01:34:23.600]   I know.
[01:34:23.600 --> 01:34:25.520]   I wasn't paying attention at first.
[01:34:25.520 --> 01:34:26.320]   But yes, this is a--
[01:34:26.320 --> 01:34:30.080]   My husband actually has an entire book on this.
[01:34:30.080 --> 01:34:32.640]   Yeah.
[01:34:32.640 --> 01:34:33.200]   Okay.
[01:34:33.200 --> 01:34:37.600]   They all feel a little like get rich quick schemes, except they work if you put enough effort and
[01:34:37.600 --> 01:34:38.480]   energy into it.
[01:34:38.480 --> 01:34:42.560]   It's kind of like building up back in the day an affiliate marketing page that worked.
[01:34:42.560 --> 01:34:42.560]   Yes.
[01:34:42.560 --> 01:34:43.920]   And people would buy them an end.
[01:34:43.920 --> 01:34:44.720]   Yes.
[01:34:44.720 --> 01:34:45.840]   Passive income stream.
[01:34:45.840 --> 01:34:46.400]   Yeah.
[01:34:46.400 --> 01:34:48.880]   So right, so Stacey, I guess there's--
[01:34:48.880 --> 01:34:50.480]   let's try this.
[01:34:50.480 --> 01:34:56.880]   You can be wise and just buy other products and then rebrand them and sell them.
[01:34:56.880 --> 01:35:01.600]   You can buy things from stores, which is the one end.
[01:35:01.600 --> 01:35:03.760]   Like, you know, go to Costco and buy stuff.
[01:35:03.760 --> 01:35:08.560]   Or you can design products and make them through manufacturers.
[01:35:08.560 --> 01:35:08.720]   Right?
[01:35:08.720 --> 01:35:10.320]   There's a range there, I think.
[01:35:10.320 --> 01:35:10.640]   No?
[01:35:10.640 --> 01:35:12.000]   Yeah.
[01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:16.000]   Well, you just described like all the options of manufacturing or getting a--
[01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:18.320]   selling a product, basically.
[01:35:18.320 --> 01:35:19.120]   That's what's happening.
[01:35:19.120 --> 01:35:19.120]   Right.
[01:35:19.120 --> 01:35:21.280]   You can do it as one person.
[01:35:21.280 --> 01:35:22.240]   You could do it as now one person.
[01:35:22.240 --> 01:35:22.240]   Right.
[01:35:22.240 --> 01:35:22.800]   Well, yeah.
[01:35:22.800 --> 01:35:23.360]   Well, this company--
[01:35:23.360 --> 01:35:28.400]   I bet you 20 years Thrasio, which I've just learned about today from this article,
[01:35:28.400 --> 01:35:29.920]   is going to be like Procter and Gamble.
[01:35:29.920 --> 01:35:31.440]   I mean, this is how these guys started.
[01:35:31.440 --> 01:35:34.880]   They made soap because there was leftover--
[01:35:34.880 --> 01:35:37.360]   this is another great book, by the way.
[01:35:37.360 --> 01:35:39.200]   I mentioned before called Clean.
[01:35:39.200 --> 01:35:40.080]   It goes with breath.
[01:35:40.080 --> 01:35:43.120]   But it's about the soap industry.
[01:35:43.120 --> 01:35:48.960]   And these guys-- these meat rendering plants had a lot of animal fat.
[01:35:48.960 --> 01:35:49.840]   And then you know what to do.
[01:35:49.840 --> 01:35:50.640]   They were throwing it out.
[01:35:50.640 --> 01:35:52.720]   They turned it into soap.
[01:35:52.720 --> 01:35:54.640]   Now you have to make a market for soap.
[01:35:54.640 --> 01:35:58.720]   And that's why Lever Brothers, Procter, and Gamble, and all these companies that are huge now.
[01:35:58.720 --> 01:35:59.520]   That's how they started.
[01:35:59.520 --> 01:36:00.560]   It's kind of like the same thing.
[01:36:00.560 --> 01:36:03.920]   You see, for instance, Thrasio said,
[01:36:03.920 --> 01:36:07.040]   "Everything we buy is a solution to a problem of some kind.
[01:36:07.040 --> 01:36:10.880]   Much of what Joshua Silberstein, the founder, looks for is
[01:36:10.880 --> 01:36:12.720]   obvious, a good product if--
[01:36:12.720 --> 01:36:14.240]   It's a long tail that Chris--
[01:36:14.240 --> 01:36:15.280]   Long tail.
[01:36:15.280 --> 01:36:16.720]   Yes, Chris, Chris, this is right.
[01:36:16.720 --> 01:36:17.440]   Chris, this is a long tail.
[01:36:17.440 --> 01:36:19.440]   A solid, skilled, supply chain--
[01:36:19.440 --> 01:36:20.240]   A lot of manufacturing.
[01:36:20.240 --> 01:36:26.800]   As an example, they talk about angry orange, pet deodorizer, an acquisition,
[01:36:26.800 --> 01:36:28.640]   which they point to as a success story.
[01:36:28.640 --> 01:36:32.720]   30 million in revenue last year, they paid 1.4 million to buy it two years ago.
[01:36:32.720 --> 01:36:36.240]   Or Trail Buddy, it's brand of hiking poles.
[01:36:36.240 --> 01:36:39.520]   Or for--
[01:36:39.520 --> 01:36:40.240]   Or dogs?
[01:36:40.240 --> 01:36:41.360]   Yeah, might as well.
[01:36:41.360 --> 01:36:43.200]   Everything should be for dogs.
[01:36:43.200 --> 01:36:47.440]   Or for its extensive listings in bedding, crafting supplies, coolers, and thermoses.
[01:36:47.440 --> 01:36:49.680]   It's like, you have fine-needed fillet.
[01:36:49.680 --> 01:36:51.840]   So how are these things found?
[01:36:51.840 --> 01:36:54.400]   Does somebody going in and searching for dog car seat?
[01:36:54.400 --> 01:36:55.680]   Or do they have--
[01:36:55.680 --> 01:36:56.560]   That's--
[01:36:56.560 --> 01:36:57.520]   I advertise it on Amazon.
[01:36:57.520 --> 01:36:59.200]   I think that's one of the things that's changed.
[01:36:59.200 --> 01:36:59.760]   Or do they do social?
[01:36:59.760 --> 01:37:03.600]   That's one of the things that's changed is you can do your market research on Amazon.
[01:37:03.600 --> 01:37:07.360]   You go to China, you get it made, and you sell it on Amazon.
[01:37:07.360 --> 01:37:09.040]   I mean, that's how you find a market.
[01:37:09.040 --> 01:37:09.680]   Complete circle.
[01:37:09.680 --> 01:37:10.560]   It's a complete circle.
[01:37:10.560 --> 01:37:16.800]   And by the way, Silverstein says when you're really successful on Amazon,
[01:37:16.800 --> 01:37:19.600]   it might make up 95% of your net worth.
[01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:23.120]   You're in a place where it's kind of hard to diversify,
[01:37:23.120 --> 01:37:25.360]   and then what if something goes wrong?
[01:37:25.360 --> 01:37:28.880]   So I guess he's concerned about Amazon, but what are you going to do?
[01:37:28.880 --> 01:37:37.760]   One thing about the dog seat guy is that you do get caught in a problem of capital.
[01:37:37.760 --> 01:37:41.920]   Yeah, just the only solid for low six figures.
[01:37:41.920 --> 01:37:44.400]   That's a lot of work for $100,000.
[01:37:44.400 --> 01:37:49.200]   Low's kind of a lesson for him, but the point is that if you don't make enough,
[01:37:49.200 --> 01:37:51.120]   then it's an opportunity cost.
[01:37:51.120 --> 01:37:53.200]   If you make too many, then you're stuck with a warehouse filled--
[01:37:53.200 --> 01:37:53.840]   Right.
[01:37:53.840 --> 01:37:58.000]   --or an Amazon warehouse filled with dog seats, which they probably charge you space for every month.
[01:37:58.000 --> 01:37:59.840]   That's why you build--
[01:37:59.840 --> 01:38:02.160]   That's why you actually just find hot products.
[01:38:02.160 --> 01:38:06.880]   You do the whole virtual storefront instead, and you just source them from Alibaba.
[01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:09.040]   That's where the money is.
[01:38:09.040 --> 01:38:10.080]   That's where you kick the--
[01:38:10.080 --> 01:38:10.160]   Or you kick the--
[01:38:10.160 --> 01:38:12.240]   --and you use your customer's capital.
[01:38:12.240 --> 01:38:14.320]   Or that.
[01:38:14.320 --> 01:38:14.640]   Okay.
[01:38:14.640 --> 01:38:16.320]   This is--
[01:38:16.320 --> 01:38:22.320]   The lesson that Andrew learned in his early days was just don't do a business with inventory.
[01:38:22.960 --> 01:38:24.720]   Yeah, never want inventory.
[01:38:24.720 --> 01:38:27.840]   And if you don't have to do fulfillment all the better, and guess what Amazon does?
[01:38:27.840 --> 01:38:30.400]   Inventory and fulfillment.
[01:38:30.400 --> 01:38:30.960]   All of it.
[01:38:30.960 --> 01:38:33.200]   But you don't want to hold it in the inventory if you put it for not very long.
[01:38:33.200 --> 01:38:37.520]   No, but Bezos is brilliant because he's just taking a little bit from every one of these companies.
[01:38:37.520 --> 01:38:38.000]   Yeah.
[01:38:38.000 --> 01:38:39.840]   And he's facilitating it.
[01:38:39.840 --> 01:38:47.040]   The lesson for us as buyers is buyer beware, because there's all sorts of crap on Amazon.
[01:38:47.040 --> 01:38:48.080]   Right.
[01:38:48.080 --> 01:38:48.320]   Right?
[01:38:48.320 --> 01:38:51.200]   I just bought-- well, I didn't buy it from Amazon.
[01:38:52.240 --> 01:38:55.840]   I think it was an Instagram ad or a Facebook ad.
[01:38:55.840 --> 01:38:56.960]   I probably was a Facebook ad.
[01:38:56.960 --> 01:39:01.200]   And it was a hoodie, a lined hoodie, and I want one more for next winter.
[01:39:01.200 --> 01:39:04.480]   And I got it, and it smells awful.
[01:39:04.480 --> 01:39:05.280]   Yeah.
[01:39:05.280 --> 01:39:06.720]   That's a real terrible--
[01:39:06.720 --> 01:39:08.240]   --a lot of these Chinese things.
[01:39:08.240 --> 01:39:09.440]   And I didn't look--
[01:39:09.440 --> 01:39:11.600]   And I didn't see what the return policy was.
[01:39:11.600 --> 01:39:12.400]   I always look.
[01:39:12.400 --> 01:39:13.520]   This time I didn't look.
[01:39:13.520 --> 01:39:14.640]   And it says we don't take returns.
[01:39:14.640 --> 01:39:15.600]   Because it's a--
[01:39:15.600 --> 01:39:15.600]   We know it's--
[01:39:15.600 --> 01:39:17.120]   --when I emailed them.
[01:39:17.120 --> 01:39:20.800]   And they said, well, if you take a picture of the problem, how do you take a picture of smell?
[01:39:20.800 --> 01:39:21.280]   Right.
[01:39:21.280 --> 01:39:22.800]   Um, we'll give you the money back.
[01:39:22.800 --> 01:39:24.080]   You can just keep it, because we're too small.
[01:39:24.080 --> 01:39:24.560]   We don't get it.
[01:39:24.560 --> 01:39:25.120]   I want it back.
[01:39:25.120 --> 01:39:25.600]   Yeah.
[01:39:25.600 --> 01:39:26.400]   We'll throw it a shot.
[01:39:26.400 --> 01:39:30.640]   Well, just-- no, take a picture of you holding your nose and having somebody else go,
[01:39:30.640 --> 01:39:31.200]   "Ah!"
[01:39:31.200 --> 01:39:31.680]   Yeah.
[01:39:31.680 --> 01:39:33.040]   And little lines.
[01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:33.840]   It's always good to draw.
[01:39:33.840 --> 01:39:34.800]   Little lines coming up.
[01:39:34.800 --> 01:39:35.360]   Little lines.
[01:39:35.360 --> 01:39:35.840]   It's a lot of fun.
[01:39:35.840 --> 01:39:35.920]   Yeah.
[01:39:35.920 --> 01:39:35.920]   Yeah.
[01:39:35.920 --> 01:39:36.400]   Yeah.
[01:39:36.400 --> 01:39:43.520]   The kid-- remember the cryptocurrency hack on Twitter where
[01:39:43.520 --> 01:39:49.680]   kid gets on and tweets is Joe Biden in Barack Obama and Bill Gates and Elon Musk saying,
[01:39:49.680 --> 01:39:57.600]   "I've decided to give a portion of my fortune to them on the needy or to the undeserving.
[01:39:57.600 --> 01:39:58.640]   It doesn't really matter.
[01:39:58.640 --> 01:40:00.880]   And here's my Bitcoin wallet.
[01:40:00.880 --> 01:40:01.520]   Help me out.
[01:40:01.520 --> 01:40:02.960]   Send me some money so we can share it.
[01:40:02.960 --> 01:40:04.160]   I'll double it."
[01:40:04.160 --> 01:40:05.920]   He was 18 years old.
[01:40:05.920 --> 01:40:11.440]   Actually, no, he was 17 years old when he did it.
[01:40:11.440 --> 01:40:12.080]   I took this for him.
[01:40:12.080 --> 01:40:13.040]   He was 17.
[01:40:13.040 --> 01:40:14.000]   He was 17.
[01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:15.360]   Well, maybe not.
[01:40:15.360 --> 01:40:17.200]   Well, he's on a youth for a run.
[01:40:17.200 --> 01:40:23.360]   He pled guilty to all state charges, three years sentence in a juvenile facility in Tampa.
[01:40:23.360 --> 01:40:24.400]   He's 18 now.
[01:40:24.400 --> 01:40:31.200]   We even said at the time, remember this hack?
[01:40:31.200 --> 01:40:32.720]   We were on the air when this happened.
[01:40:32.720 --> 01:40:33.200]   Yeah.
[01:40:33.200 --> 01:40:34.160]   You said it's a kid.
[01:40:34.160 --> 01:40:36.240]   We said--
[01:40:36.240 --> 01:40:38.080]   The war was really clever Russia.
[01:40:38.080 --> 01:40:38.240]   Yeah.
[01:40:38.240 --> 01:40:41.680]   It was really puzzling because it could have been so much more--
[01:40:41.680 --> 01:40:42.880]   Of course, it was a 17-year-old.
[01:40:42.880 --> 01:40:43.360]   That's why.
[01:40:44.960 --> 01:40:49.760]   He got 12.86 Bitcoin at $117,000 in the day to the attack.
[01:40:49.760 --> 01:40:51.280]   A little more now if he--
[01:40:51.280 --> 01:40:52.800]   What a war does it cost him?
[01:40:52.800 --> 01:40:53.040]   Yeah.
[01:40:53.040 --> 01:41:01.520]   So he pled guilty, one kind of organized fraud, 17 counts of communications fraud,
[01:41:01.520 --> 01:41:06.080]   one kind of fraudulent use of personal information with at least--
[01:41:06.080 --> 01:41:08.800]   All of which his guilty should have done it.
[01:41:08.800 --> 01:41:09.600]   It's all wrong.
[01:41:09.600 --> 01:41:10.720]   But he's clearly bright.
[01:41:10.720 --> 01:41:13.920]   Imagine if this kid went to college and got a decent career.
[01:41:13.920 --> 01:41:17.120]   When he gets out of juvie, he's going to get some job offers, I'm sure.
[01:41:17.120 --> 01:41:17.200]   Yeah.
[01:41:17.200 --> 01:41:18.080]   He'll have jobs.
[01:41:18.080 --> 01:41:18.720]   He'll be fine.
[01:41:18.720 --> 01:41:19.120]   Yeah.
[01:41:19.120 --> 01:41:20.320]   Yeah.
[01:41:20.320 --> 01:41:21.520]   He'll be fine.
[01:41:21.520 --> 01:41:21.840]   Yeah.
[01:41:21.840 --> 01:41:26.080]   Tampa Bay newspaper said three years in prison.
[01:41:26.080 --> 01:41:27.120]   No, it's juvie.
[01:41:27.120 --> 01:41:29.920]   Well, you won't want to be there.
[01:41:29.920 --> 01:41:30.160]   Yeah.
[01:41:30.160 --> 01:41:30.640]   Well, no.
[01:41:30.640 --> 01:41:36.080]   And then, and by the way, they posted them just the scariest picture of this guy.
[01:41:36.080 --> 01:41:41.840]   So I'm not going to say his name because he's a kid.
[01:41:41.840 --> 01:41:42.800]   He's a kid.
[01:41:42.800 --> 01:41:43.600]   He's a yout.
[01:41:43.600 --> 01:41:44.240]   He's a yout.
[01:41:44.240 --> 01:41:46.480]   You know who's not a yout?
[01:41:46.480 --> 01:41:47.520]   Clearly a hard hit.
[01:41:47.520 --> 01:41:49.520]   Elon Musk is a hardhead, though.
[01:41:49.520 --> 01:41:51.120]   He's not a yout, but he's a hardhead.
[01:41:51.120 --> 01:41:51.600]   He's a really hardhead.
[01:41:51.600 --> 01:41:59.120]   His new title, TechnoKing, the company's CFO, Tesla CFOs now designated Master of Coin.
[01:41:59.120 --> 01:42:06.640]   This found in documents filed with the Security and Exchange Commission.
[01:42:06.640 --> 01:42:09.840]   That's taken in seriously.
[01:42:10.800 --> 01:42:19.040]   In the 8K filing, both executives will also retain the CEO and CFO titles, but please
[01:42:19.040 --> 01:42:19.520]   reply.
[01:42:19.520 --> 01:42:21.200]   Well, I think we need to do lower thirds.
[01:42:21.200 --> 01:42:22.720]   What's what do you want?
[01:42:22.720 --> 01:42:23.840]   I was emailing Jason about the title.
[01:42:23.840 --> 01:42:24.320]   What do you want?
[01:42:24.320 --> 01:42:25.280]   You want to be TechnoKing?
[01:42:25.280 --> 01:42:26.240]   I think you are.
[01:42:26.240 --> 01:42:27.680]   You are the pod dictator.
[01:42:27.680 --> 01:42:30.800]   Not in democracy.
[01:42:30.800 --> 01:42:32.000]   Exactly.
[01:42:32.000 --> 01:42:36.400]   Stacey is the I/O Tsar.
[01:42:36.400 --> 01:42:37.040]   Oh, I like it.
[01:42:37.040 --> 01:42:37.680]   That's quite work as well.
[01:42:37.680 --> 01:42:38.320]   I owe Tsar.
[01:42:38.320 --> 01:42:38.880]   I like it.
[01:42:39.840 --> 01:42:40.880]   It looks like you're in.
[01:42:40.880 --> 01:42:43.280]   Ant is the Master of Pickles.
[01:42:43.280 --> 01:42:44.880]   Master Pickles.
[01:42:44.880 --> 01:42:46.000]   Pickles.
[01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:46.480]   Pickles.
[01:42:46.480 --> 01:42:46.800]   Pickles.
[01:42:46.800 --> 01:42:48.880]   Master of Pickles.
[01:42:48.880 --> 01:42:49.920]   And what is your title?
[01:42:49.920 --> 01:42:50.720]   Well, with barbecue.
[01:42:50.720 --> 01:42:51.520]   What is your title?
[01:42:51.520 --> 01:42:52.480]   Oh, Jeff Jarvis.
[01:42:52.480 --> 01:42:53.040]   I don't have one.
[01:42:53.040 --> 01:42:53.680]   I don't have one.
[01:42:53.680 --> 01:42:55.200]   Oh, we got to have a title for him.
[01:42:55.200 --> 01:42:56.880]   How about the TechnoPanic King?
[01:42:56.880 --> 01:42:59.360]   Or Mr. Moral Panic?
[01:42:59.360 --> 01:42:59.760]   No, no, no, no, no.
[01:42:59.760 --> 01:43:02.160]   They are the arbiter of Panic.
[01:43:02.160 --> 01:43:04.320]   The arbiter of Panic.
[01:43:04.320 --> 01:43:07.440]   I'm totally fine with Courtchester over here.
[01:43:07.440 --> 01:43:07.680]   Yeah.
[01:43:07.680 --> 01:43:09.120]   Actually, Jeff can be the keeper.
[01:43:09.120 --> 01:43:10.400]   The keeper of the Panic.
[01:43:10.400 --> 01:43:11.840]   Yeah.
[01:43:11.840 --> 01:43:13.200]   The keeper of the Panic.
[01:43:13.200 --> 01:43:15.200]   John's working hard.
[01:43:15.200 --> 01:43:16.000]   He's got one.
[01:43:16.000 --> 01:43:17.440]   Release the Panic.
[01:43:17.440 --> 01:43:18.480]   Release the Panic.
[01:43:18.480 --> 01:43:19.520]   I am the Panic.
[01:43:19.520 --> 01:43:20.800]   Keeper Pod Dictator.
[01:43:20.800 --> 01:43:22.640]   Pod Dictator.
[01:43:22.640 --> 01:43:23.200]   Actually, it looks like.
[01:43:23.200 --> 01:43:24.960]   Like, it looks like Po Dictator.
[01:43:24.960 --> 01:43:25.600]   It's not good.
[01:43:25.600 --> 01:43:27.040]   It's not good.
[01:43:27.040 --> 01:43:28.880]   Po Dictator.
[01:43:28.880 --> 01:43:32.640]   I-O-T-S-A-R for Stacey, the I/O Tsar.
[01:43:32.640 --> 01:43:34.640]   Chief Twit.
[01:43:34.640 --> 01:43:34.960]   Yeah.
[01:43:34.960 --> 01:43:36.400]   Well, I am still the Chief Twit.
[01:43:36.400 --> 01:43:36.960]   I always have.
[01:43:36.960 --> 01:43:38.480]   What was Zuckerberg's?
[01:43:38.480 --> 01:43:39.920]   I'm the CEO.
[01:43:39.920 --> 01:43:40.480]   I'm CEO-
[01:43:40.480 --> 01:43:42.400]   I'm CEO-
[01:43:42.400 --> 01:43:42.880]   Bitch.
[01:43:42.880 --> 01:43:46.240]   It was on his card.
[01:43:46.240 --> 01:43:47.360]   That was kind of funny.
[01:43:47.360 --> 01:43:48.880]   All right.
[01:43:48.880 --> 01:43:51.680]   I'm not going to say anything about NFTs.
[01:43:51.680 --> 01:43:52.640]   We've done NFTs.
[01:43:52.640 --> 01:43:54.800]   But this is a great thread.
[01:43:54.800 --> 01:43:55.200]   Wow.
[01:43:55.200 --> 01:43:59.440]   So, we had,
[01:43:59.440 --> 01:44:01.760]   last week we had,
[01:44:01.760 --> 01:44:04.640]   you missed it, Trei Rachliphon, Stacey,
[01:44:04.640 --> 01:44:06.000]   my favorite photographer.
[01:44:06.000 --> 01:44:07.360]   He's doing NFTs.
[01:44:07.360 --> 01:44:08.800]   Other than Ant, Pruitt.
[01:44:08.800 --> 01:44:10.400]   I like him.
[01:44:10.400 --> 01:44:12.400]   But I've known Trei for 20 years.
[01:44:12.400 --> 01:44:13.440]   Trei is still Trei.
[01:44:13.440 --> 01:44:14.400]   Yeah, I won't trust me.
[01:44:14.400 --> 01:44:15.600]   I'm not jealous here.
[01:44:15.600 --> 01:44:16.080]   All right.
[01:44:16.080 --> 01:44:16.480]   All right.
[01:44:16.480 --> 01:44:17.360]   You're a humble man.
[01:44:17.360 --> 01:44:18.480]   So, there's two NFT stories.
[01:44:18.480 --> 01:44:19.440]   This one is wild.
[01:44:19.440 --> 01:44:23.680]   The artist, known as Beeple,
[01:44:23.680 --> 01:44:27.040]   sold one of his images.
[01:44:27.040 --> 01:44:29.280]   It's actually all of his images in a single image,
[01:44:29.280 --> 01:44:30.880]   the first 5,000 days.
[01:44:30.880 --> 01:44:32.320]   For more,
[01:44:32.320 --> 01:44:36.880]   it's the third highest sale for any living artist
[01:44:36.880 --> 01:44:39.360]   after Jeff Koons and David Hockney,
[01:44:39.360 --> 01:44:42.320]   his jpeg.
[01:44:42.320 --> 01:44:43.520]   It's a jpeg,
[01:44:43.520 --> 01:44:45.040]   not even,
[01:44:45.040 --> 01:44:48.000]   not even a ping or a tiff.
[01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:49.520]   This is a lossy format.
[01:44:49.520 --> 01:44:54.080]   It's a lossy format for $60 million.
[01:44:54.080 --> 01:44:55.840]   When you include Christie's fee,
[01:44:55.840 --> 01:44:56.960]   the auction house,
[01:44:56.960 --> 01:45:02.480]   $69.3 million for a jpeg,
[01:45:02.480 --> 01:45:04.000]   for a lossy format.
[01:45:06.400 --> 01:45:07.680]   More than any,
[01:45:07.680 --> 01:45:09.840]   everybody except Jeff Koons and David Hockney.
[01:45:09.840 --> 01:45:11.040]   It's crazy.
[01:45:11.040 --> 01:45:12.800]   It's crazy.
[01:45:12.800 --> 01:45:13.280]   Crazy too.
[01:45:13.280 --> 01:45:14.160]   Who bought it?
[01:45:14.160 --> 01:45:14.720]   Who bought it?
[01:45:14.720 --> 01:45:17.200]   Well, Metacovan is the pseudonym,
[01:45:17.200 --> 01:45:18.800]   but I think it's kind of,
[01:45:18.800 --> 01:45:21.200]   we've kind of uncovered who he is.
[01:45:21.200 --> 01:45:22.720]   And thanks to Amy Castor,
[01:45:22.720 --> 01:45:24.640]   who's a blogger,
[01:45:24.640 --> 01:45:26.800]   but did I think some good research
[01:45:26.800 --> 01:45:29.440]   figuring out that Metacovan is actually
[01:45:29.440 --> 01:45:31.760]   a well-known crypto entrepreneur,
[01:45:31.760 --> 01:45:33.600]   Vignesh Sundarason.
[01:45:33.600 --> 01:45:35.440]   And I think this confirms
[01:45:35.440 --> 01:45:36.320]   what we really thought,
[01:45:36.320 --> 01:45:37.680]   which is that a lot of the money
[01:45:37.680 --> 01:45:38.720]   being spent right now
[01:45:38.720 --> 01:45:40.320]   and NFTs comes from,
[01:45:40.320 --> 01:45:42.240]   is made up money,
[01:45:42.240 --> 01:45:43.760]   is found money anyway.
[01:45:43.760 --> 01:45:46.560]   It's Bitcoin or Ethereum.
[01:45:46.560 --> 01:45:48.320]   And for both their own business.
[01:45:48.320 --> 01:45:49.200]   Well, in this case,
[01:45:49.200 --> 01:45:52.000]   Metacovan actually probably is selling
[01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.640]   the shares of this to a syndicate
[01:45:54.640 --> 01:45:56.160]   called B20,
[01:45:56.160 --> 01:45:58.240]   of which people has 2%,
[01:45:58.240 --> 01:45:59.120]   which is bizarre.
[01:45:59.120 --> 01:46:02.400]   And so,
[01:46:02.400 --> 01:46:05.040]   Metacovan makes money on this
[01:46:05.040 --> 01:46:07.360]   by buying a $69 million painting
[01:46:07.360 --> 01:46:09.600]   and then selling shares to people who,
[01:46:09.600 --> 01:46:09.920]   you know.
[01:46:09.920 --> 01:46:11.600]   Don't put your retirement here, folks.
[01:46:11.600 --> 01:46:12.240]   Yeah.
[01:46:12.240 --> 01:46:13.680]   And it's all speculation.
[01:46:13.680 --> 01:46:15.040]   It's all, you know, it's all about.
[01:46:15.040 --> 01:46:16.160]   It's all, it's all, okay.
[01:46:16.160 --> 01:46:17.440]   Let's make some money.
[01:46:17.440 --> 01:46:18.960]   The thread that I put that.
[01:46:18.960 --> 01:46:20.560]   Yes, I'm going to go to the thread just a second.
[01:46:20.560 --> 01:46:20.880]   It's true.
[01:46:20.880 --> 01:46:23.440]   I do want it before we leave the Beeple story.
[01:46:23.440 --> 01:46:24.640]   I do want to point out
[01:46:24.640 --> 01:46:26.240]   another crypto millionaire,
[01:46:26.240 --> 01:46:28.160]   founder of the Tron blockchain,
[01:46:28.160 --> 01:46:30.320]   Justin Sun wanted to spend more.
[01:46:30.320 --> 01:46:32.320]   He tweeted,
[01:46:33.120 --> 01:46:35.520]   "I tried to update my bid to $70 million
[01:46:35.520 --> 01:46:37.200]   in the last 30 seconds.
[01:46:37.200 --> 01:46:39.040]   My offer was somehow not accepted
[01:46:39.040 --> 01:46:40.400]   by Christie's system,
[01:46:40.400 --> 01:46:41.920]   even though there's 20 seconds left."
[01:46:41.920 --> 01:46:43.760]   He's upset.
[01:46:43.760 --> 01:46:46.080]   He said, "I wanted to spend 70."
[01:46:46.080 --> 01:46:50.000]   There's too much money in some people's pockets.
[01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:53.680]   So, here's the thread you're referring to from,
[01:46:53.680 --> 01:46:56.720]   let's see.
[01:46:56.720 --> 01:46:57.520]   John T. Waring.
[01:46:57.520 --> 01:46:58.160]   There it is.
[01:46:58.160 --> 01:47:00.480]   John T. J-L-N-T-Y Waring.
[01:47:00.480 --> 01:47:01.920]   Do you know who John T. Waring is or is it?
[01:47:01.920 --> 01:47:02.720]   No, no idea.
[01:47:03.200 --> 01:47:04.640]   Out of curiosity, John T.
[01:47:04.640 --> 01:47:06.160]   writes, "I dug into how NFTs
[01:47:06.160 --> 01:47:08.560]   actually referenced the media you're buying
[01:47:08.560 --> 01:47:10.720]   in my eyebrows are now orbiting the moon,
[01:47:10.720 --> 01:47:12.000]   short version.
[01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:15.840]   The token you bought either points to a URL on the internet
[01:47:15.840 --> 01:47:18.320]   or an IPFS hash.
[01:47:18.320 --> 01:47:22.720]   In most circumstances, IPFS is an IP file system.
[01:47:22.720 --> 01:47:26.160]   It's basically like a distributed network file system.
[01:47:26.160 --> 01:47:28.160]   The problem with the URL is it could go up or down.
[01:47:28.160 --> 01:47:31.040]   An IPFS hash might have some longevity.
[01:47:31.040 --> 01:47:34.080]   In most circumstances, it references an IPFS gateway
[01:47:34.080 --> 01:47:37.200]   on the internet run by the startup you bought the NFT from.
[01:47:37.200 --> 01:47:40.240]   Oh, and that URL is not the medium.
[01:47:40.240 --> 01:47:42.720]   It's not the painting.
[01:47:42.720 --> 01:47:44.480]   It's not a link to the image.
[01:47:44.480 --> 01:47:49.760]   It's a JSON metadata file that basically is your blockchain entry.
[01:47:49.760 --> 01:47:52.080]   Here's the NFT token
[01:47:52.080 --> 01:47:58.400]   for artwork sold by people, not for quite so much.
[01:48:00.000 --> 01:48:01.120]   Sold by a NFT.
[01:48:01.120 --> 01:48:03.040]   This is the token.
[01:48:03.040 --> 01:48:03.520]   That's it.
[01:48:03.520 --> 01:48:06.960]   That's it right there.
[01:48:06.960 --> 01:48:10.160]   That file refers to the actual media you just bought,
[01:48:10.160 --> 01:48:13.680]   which in this case is hosted via Cloudinary CDN
[01:48:13.680 --> 01:48:15.040]   served by NFT servers again.
[01:48:15.040 --> 01:48:18.000]   So if NFT goes bust, your token is now worthless.
[01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:19.280]   It refers to nothing.
[01:48:19.280 --> 01:48:20.240]   This can't be changed.
[01:48:20.240 --> 01:48:23.840]   It's in the blockchain.
[01:48:23.840 --> 01:48:26.960]   But you said some users use IPFS.
[01:48:26.960 --> 01:48:30.720]   Well, let's look at the $65 million people sold by Christie's.
[01:48:30.720 --> 01:48:35.040]   The token refers directly to an IPFS hash.
[01:48:35.040 --> 01:48:40.880]   We could take that hash and fetch the JSON metadata using a public gateway.
[01:48:40.880 --> 01:48:44.160]   So well done for referring to IPFS.
[01:48:44.160 --> 01:48:48.960]   It refers, it references the specific file rather than a breakable URL.
[01:48:48.960 --> 01:48:55.120]   But the metadata links to a website and IPFS gateway run by Makers Place,
[01:48:55.920 --> 01:48:59.200]   which is the NFT minting startup, will go bust one day.
[01:48:59.200 --> 01:49:09.200]   So basically what he's saying is all of this relies on ephemeral internet infrastructure.
[01:49:09.200 --> 01:49:14.320]   Which has always been like, I mean, that's the internet.
[01:49:14.320 --> 01:49:18.960]   And if you actually use, and you see actually some really interesting articles
[01:49:20.960 --> 01:49:26.560]   like art conservation magazines about conserving digital art that talks about a lot of this.
[01:49:26.560 --> 01:49:33.360]   So as someone who's been working on the internet for two decades, you just got to relax and let it go.
[01:49:33.360 --> 01:49:36.960]   After having this put 16 dollars in the dollar.
[01:49:36.960 --> 01:49:40.640]   Yeah, well, that's the other thing that we've asked.
[01:49:40.640 --> 01:49:46.080]   All I know is if you're to artist and you get something purchased, you better collect, transfer it quickly.
[01:49:46.080 --> 01:49:47.360]   Yeah, and turn it into dollars.
[01:49:47.360 --> 01:49:49.280]   You can turn that into real dollars.
[01:49:49.280 --> 01:49:56.480]   Yeah. So I will tell you, my helium router, it's gotten like the H&T's, the helium network.
[01:49:56.480 --> 01:49:58.880]   Tokens, tokens.
[01:49:58.880 --> 01:50:04.240]   Yeah. They're worth like $8,000. I've minted that much in H&T's.
[01:50:04.240 --> 01:50:07.440]   And I'm like, nice. Convert. I need to convert.
[01:50:07.440 --> 01:50:09.360]   Well, that's the, let's see. Here's the problem.
[01:50:09.360 --> 01:50:13.920]   Convert now. And will you be like the person who sold his Bitcoin for five dollars?
[01:50:13.920 --> 01:50:18.800]   No, I won't because I did nothing and free money is still more money.
[01:50:18.800 --> 01:50:22.960]   But it's $8,000. What if we're $80,000 or $800,000?
[01:50:22.960 --> 01:50:26.240]   It's still going to be minting. It can still, you know, it's still mint.
[01:50:26.240 --> 01:50:30.400]   So remember, remember Cranberry Juice guy?
[01:50:30.400 --> 01:50:37.200]   The longboard skater who, he's selling that as an F.T.
[01:50:37.200 --> 01:50:39.760]   You could buy that. No, no, he's selling it as an NFT.
[01:50:39.760 --> 01:50:41.600]   She's good on him.
[01:50:41.600 --> 01:50:44.000]   Yeah. Nathan Apodak will be selling the clip.
[01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:47.680]   For half a million dollars, that's the minimum bid.
[01:50:47.680 --> 01:50:48.880]   Have I house? Yeah.
[01:50:48.880 --> 01:50:53.120]   Well, people are like, you should invest that money.
[01:50:53.120 --> 01:50:53.920]   He's like, I'm going to buy a.
[01:50:53.920 --> 01:50:57.600]   I didn't want to playfully with my outlet anyway.
[01:50:57.600 --> 01:51:01.440]   That was an interesting question, though. Can he sell that?
[01:51:01.440 --> 01:51:05.760]   But it's on the TikTok platform. Isn't it TikToks too?
[01:51:05.760 --> 01:51:08.560]   No, you can sell it. That's the beauty of this.
[01:51:08.560 --> 01:51:11.840]   He made the video. So it's not about ownership.
[01:51:11.840 --> 01:51:13.040]   It's not about anything.
[01:51:13.040 --> 01:51:15.760]   Right. You could sell anything as an NFT.
[01:51:17.200 --> 01:51:20.480]   Even if you don't own it, I could sell the Mona Lisa as an F.T.
[01:51:20.480 --> 01:51:24.720]   Now you'd be foolish to buy it because I don't have any connection with the Mona Lisa,
[01:51:24.720 --> 01:51:29.360]   but I still can sell it as an NFT. If somebody bought it, the ball starts rolling.
[01:51:29.360 --> 01:51:31.200]   So I don't think anybody cares.
[01:51:31.200 --> 01:51:34.400]   The ocean spray logo on the bottle will be blurred out.
[01:51:34.400 --> 01:51:38.000]   And it will not include the Fleetwood Max song.
[01:51:38.000 --> 01:51:40.080]   That was my next question.
[01:51:40.080 --> 01:51:41.680]   Yeah. Because he can sell loads.
[01:51:41.680 --> 01:51:42.320]   The audio.
[01:51:42.320 --> 01:51:44.480]   Well, I think, as my opinion, he can.
[01:51:44.480 --> 01:51:46.160]   But you're not buying that.
[01:51:46.160 --> 01:51:47.200]   Has it turned it into art?
[01:51:47.200 --> 01:51:50.480]   Yeah. You're buying that particular rendition of it.
[01:51:50.480 --> 01:51:53.120]   But probably to avoid any.
[01:51:53.120 --> 01:51:55.920]   That is no sense to me. I don't understand.
[01:51:55.920 --> 01:51:59.200]   Yeah. I want to know what he's going to do to keep the lawyers away,
[01:51:59.200 --> 01:52:00.480]   if this happens to sale.
[01:52:00.480 --> 01:52:03.280]   What are they going to accuse him of?
[01:52:03.280 --> 01:52:07.040]   Well, again, he didn't sell. He's not selling anything.
[01:52:07.040 --> 01:52:11.040]   But he's not. But what is he selling?
[01:52:11.040 --> 01:52:18.000]   When you buy an NBA highlight, what do you get?
[01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:20.560]   You don't get anything.
[01:52:20.560 --> 01:52:22.480]   You got the ownership of that particular.
[01:52:22.480 --> 01:52:24.080]   No, you don't know. You don't know.
[01:52:24.080 --> 01:52:26.160]   Oh, geez.
[01:52:26.160 --> 01:52:26.960]   That's so wacky.
[01:52:26.960 --> 01:52:31.280]   The NBA still owns it and can run it and all that stuff.
[01:52:31.280 --> 01:52:32.480]   I don't get it.
[01:52:32.480 --> 01:52:34.400]   He's going to buy a house for his parents
[01:52:34.400 --> 01:52:37.200]   and fund a new event center in his hometown Idaho Falls.
[01:52:37.200 --> 01:52:39.040]   Well, let's see.
[01:52:39.040 --> 01:52:39.520]   We'll see.
[01:52:39.520 --> 01:52:40.240]   Don't be good.
[01:52:40.240 --> 01:52:41.840]   We'll see if he gets.
[01:52:41.840 --> 01:52:42.000]   Yeah.
[01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:43.680]   I'll be good to it safely.
[01:52:43.680 --> 01:52:44.400]   I'll see that.
[01:52:44.400 --> 01:52:44.720]   Yeah.
[01:52:44.720 --> 01:52:49.600]   I'm changing.
[01:52:49.600 --> 01:52:52.000]   Yeah, I should really do the change.
[01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.160]   But I really want to talk about the freedom phone.
[01:52:54.160 --> 01:52:56.960]   The freedom phone out of the US.
[01:52:56.960 --> 01:52:58.000]   Because you can't find out.
[01:52:58.000 --> 01:52:58.240]   Yeah.
[01:52:58.240 --> 01:53:00.160]   What is this?
[01:53:00.160 --> 01:53:01.680]   Oh, this is changed.
[01:53:01.680 --> 01:53:04.080]   Oh, this is interesting.
[01:53:04.080 --> 01:53:09.040]   This was when I bookmarked it had a picture of a phone.
[01:53:09.040 --> 01:53:12.000]   It was obviously an Android phone and all this.
[01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:15.360]   I think it's kind of a scam, but we'll see.
[01:53:15.360 --> 01:53:17.200]   Oh, they're selling a phone.
[01:53:17.200 --> 01:53:18.320]   Oh, yeah.
[01:53:18.320 --> 01:53:21.520]   I'm sorry because the link that I put has changed
[01:53:21.520 --> 01:53:22.640]   since I put it in there.
[01:53:22.640 --> 01:53:25.440]   They're selling a phone for conservatives
[01:53:25.440 --> 01:53:27.440]   who come preloaded with Parler and Gab.
[01:53:27.440 --> 01:53:31.040]   You want to buy an NFT at a bridge?
[01:53:31.040 --> 01:53:31.760]   I'll tell you both.
[01:53:31.760 --> 01:53:35.200]   I honestly think they're just selling some old Android phone
[01:53:35.200 --> 01:53:37.040]   with some apps installed.
[01:53:37.040 --> 01:53:37.920]   But we'll see.
[01:53:37.920 --> 01:53:38.800]   Pablo phone.
[01:53:38.800 --> 01:53:39.440]   Yeah.
[01:53:39.440 --> 01:53:40.640]   Yeah, remember that?
[01:53:40.640 --> 01:53:41.680]   Pablo Escobar.
[01:53:41.680 --> 01:53:42.560]   The Escobar.
[01:53:42.560 --> 01:53:42.880]   Yeah.
[01:53:42.880 --> 01:53:45.360]   All right.
[01:53:45.360 --> 01:53:45.840]   All right.
[01:53:45.840 --> 01:53:46.320]   All right.
[01:53:46.320 --> 01:53:46.880]   Oh my gosh.
[01:53:46.880 --> 01:53:49.840]   They say it costs $450 for this phone.
[01:53:49.840 --> 01:53:51.280]   And it is.
[01:53:51.280 --> 01:53:53.680]   Oh, yeah.
[01:53:53.680 --> 01:53:55.120]   It has Parler.
[01:53:55.120 --> 01:53:55.840]   It's a galaxy.
[01:53:55.840 --> 01:53:57.920]   Yeah, but it's an Android phone.
[01:53:57.920 --> 01:53:58.960]   This isn't it.
[01:53:58.960 --> 01:53:59.920]   This is another story.
[01:53:59.920 --> 01:54:02.880]   California, I think this is misreported.
[01:54:02.880 --> 01:54:06.000]   It has been widely reported that they have a new regulation
[01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:11.760]   banning dark patterns as part of the California Consumer Privacy Act.
[01:54:11.760 --> 01:54:16.000]   I don't think you're so you know what dark patterns are.
[01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:17.600]   Those are and by the way, it'd be very hard
[01:54:17.600 --> 01:54:19.200]   to prosecute people for dark patterns
[01:54:19.200 --> 01:54:20.880]   because it's really in the eye of it to be older.
[01:54:20.880 --> 01:54:24.800]   But these are things that kind of psychological tricks
[01:54:24.800 --> 01:54:29.280]   that get you to pay for something or forget to unsubscribe something like that.
[01:54:29.280 --> 01:54:30.800]   So it's it's a way of taking you
[01:54:30.800 --> 01:54:34.080]   underhanded strategies that rely on confusing language
[01:54:34.080 --> 01:54:38.160]   or unnecessary steps such as forced clicking or scrolling through multiple screens
[01:54:38.160 --> 01:54:41.760]   or listening to why you shouldn't opt out of their data sale.
[01:54:41.760 --> 01:54:44.800]   This is from the California Attorney General's office.
[01:54:44.800 --> 01:54:50.720]   I don't think the regulation actually does that.
[01:54:50.720 --> 01:54:54.960]   And it would be very hard if it did to say this is a dark pattern.
[01:54:54.960 --> 01:54:55.520]   This isn't.
[01:54:55.520 --> 01:54:58.160]   This is just the internet.
[01:54:58.160 --> 01:54:59.120]   And we'll see.
[01:54:59.120 --> 01:55:01.200]   This we'll see.
[01:55:02.800 --> 01:55:07.440]   Is that similar to like the pop-up windows you get that would have the tiny
[01:55:07.440 --> 01:55:10.320]   X hidden sort of up in the corner?
[01:55:10.320 --> 01:55:10.880]   Yes.
[01:55:10.880 --> 01:55:11.360]   Obviously.
[01:55:11.360 --> 01:55:12.320]   That's a dark pattern.
[01:55:12.320 --> 01:55:16.800]   Actually, there's a great site if you want to see a whole lot of dark patterns.
[01:55:16.800 --> 01:55:19.200]   I think it's dark patterns.org.
[01:55:19.200 --> 01:55:20.960]   Let me just see if that's right.
[01:55:20.960 --> 01:55:25.520]   Yep, dark patterns.org, which has the Hall of Shame.
[01:55:25.520 --> 01:55:31.520]   And there's a lot of them in here.
[01:55:31.520 --> 01:55:32.160]   Lovely.
[01:55:32.160 --> 01:55:32.800]   Yeah.
[01:55:32.800 --> 01:55:36.800]   So if you're curious, the problem is, you know, I don't know how.
[01:55:36.800 --> 01:55:42.640]   I mean, the one the Attorney General offered is pretty, pretty bad.
[01:55:42.640 --> 01:55:46.240]   Here's a window that says, "Are you sure you want to opt out?"
[01:55:46.240 --> 01:55:47.360]   No, take me back.
[01:55:47.360 --> 01:55:54.560]   And then very, very, very light printing underneath that.
[01:55:54.560 --> 01:55:55.920]   Yeah, yeah, I want to opt out.
[01:55:57.200 --> 01:56:03.920]   And then a big, long piece of text, very tiny text saying, "If you opt out."
[01:56:03.920 --> 01:56:06.800]   But I don't know again.
[01:56:06.800 --> 01:56:08.160]   I don't know.
[01:56:08.160 --> 01:56:10.080]   It might just be consumer protection and stuff.
[01:56:10.080 --> 01:56:12.720]   Let's do a Google change log.
[01:56:12.720 --> 01:56:17.840]   The Google change log.
[01:56:17.840 --> 01:56:24.160]   Big improvement to Google Maps is kind of getting ways like,
[01:56:24.160 --> 01:56:26.080]   I know you use Waze, Jeff.
[01:56:26.080 --> 01:56:30.800]   And one of the things that makes Waze so good is, as its users can add
[01:56:30.800 --> 01:56:32.880]   to the maps, can put police in and so forth.
[01:56:32.880 --> 01:56:41.680]   Google now is allowing you to actually draw or new or missing roads on maps.
[01:56:41.680 --> 01:56:42.880]   Actually, draw on the map.
[01:56:42.880 --> 01:56:46.320]   There'll be a side menu button called Edit the Map.
[01:56:46.320 --> 01:56:47.840]   You can select Missing Road.
[01:56:47.840 --> 01:56:51.360]   And now the power to map is in your hands.
[01:56:51.360 --> 01:56:53.440]   What could possibly go wrong?
[01:56:53.440 --> 01:56:55.600]   Add Missing Roads by drawing lines.
[01:56:55.600 --> 01:56:58.720]   Quickly rename roads, change roads directionality,
[01:56:58.720 --> 01:57:01.280]   and rear line or delete correct roads.
[01:57:01.280 --> 01:57:01.680]   Objector Lane.
[01:57:01.680 --> 01:57:04.560]   That's what I live.
[01:57:04.560 --> 01:57:10.320]   Waze figured out how to do this properly.
[01:57:10.320 --> 01:57:14.480]   So I imagine Google probably from the ways things is getting this.
[01:57:14.480 --> 01:57:18.240]   There's a lot of nice little features in there adding to Google Maps.
[01:57:18.240 --> 01:57:23.120]   More ways to share photos, reviews, things like that.
[01:57:23.120 --> 01:57:24.960]   That's in the keyword blog.
[01:57:24.960 --> 01:57:26.800]   Maps gets better all the time.
[01:57:26.800 --> 01:57:30.080]   Live captioning is coming to Chrome.
[01:57:30.080 --> 01:57:34.000]   Fabulous feature.
[01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:35.840]   I think it's on Android.
[01:57:35.840 --> 01:57:37.360]   Most Android only.
[01:57:37.360 --> 01:57:37.920]   Yeah.
[01:57:37.920 --> 01:57:40.320]   But certainly if you have a Pixel phone, you've seen it at work.
[01:57:40.320 --> 01:57:43.280]   And I think it's one of the coolest, coolest things.
[01:57:43.280 --> 01:57:46.560]   I guess the S20 now has it, the OnePlus 8, OnePlus Nord.
[01:57:46.560 --> 01:57:49.600]   And it's going to be part of Google Chrome.
[01:57:49.600 --> 01:57:51.840]   A live caption feature when you're watching a video,
[01:57:51.840 --> 01:57:56.640]   it'll automatically capture it, caption, which is helpful.
[01:57:56.640 --> 01:57:59.600]   Of course for people who have hearing issues,
[01:57:59.600 --> 01:58:03.280]   but I think in general, sometimes captions are pretty useful.
[01:58:03.280 --> 01:58:06.400]   Captions will appear in a small pop-up window at the bottom of the video.
[01:58:06.400 --> 01:58:08.480]   Oh, that explains it.
[01:58:08.480 --> 01:58:11.120]   I've been seeing those last two days.
[01:58:11.120 --> 01:58:14.000]   They're really small.
[01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:16.320]   Oh, that explains it.
[01:58:16.320 --> 01:58:18.400]   They've been working on this for a year.
[01:58:18.400 --> 01:58:20.640]   I've started seeing it and I didn't know it.
[01:58:21.520 --> 01:58:25.600]   Oh, now I know why I've seen captions everywhere.
[01:58:25.600 --> 01:58:28.320]   So can I caption this right now?
[01:58:28.320 --> 01:58:29.120]   Yes.
[01:58:29.120 --> 01:58:33.120]   Yeah, go and Chrome to YouTube or the live stream.
[01:58:33.120 --> 01:58:36.640]   You should be able to caption what I'm reading.
[01:58:36.640 --> 01:58:38.160]   I watch the model of videos.
[01:58:38.160 --> 01:58:39.360]   I'm on.
[01:58:39.360 --> 01:58:40.320]   Yeah, probably.
[01:58:40.320 --> 01:58:41.520]   I guess if it's in Chrome.
[01:58:41.520 --> 01:58:46.080]   I watch a lot of video at night with a sound turned off
[01:58:46.080 --> 01:58:48.400]   because my lips are taped shut and I can't get out of it.
[01:58:50.400 --> 01:58:53.600]   And I'm lately, I haven't seen it.
[01:58:53.600 --> 01:58:55.200]   You're under 80 pounds of blanket.
[01:58:55.200 --> 01:59:09.280]   YouTube is rolling out copyright checks for videos before they're published.
[01:59:09.280 --> 01:59:10.800]   And then we should start using this.
[01:59:10.800 --> 01:59:12.960]   Talk about a chilling effect.
[01:59:12.960 --> 01:59:17.680]   If you're, you know, usually what happens is you upload your video
[01:59:17.680 --> 01:59:20.000]   and you find out later that it's been pulled.
[01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:22.720]   You got to strike against you and you can't get it off.
[01:59:22.720 --> 01:59:25.920]   So this is a new part of the upload process.
[01:59:25.920 --> 01:59:26.880]   It's called checks.
[01:59:26.880 --> 01:59:31.600]   It actually analyzes the video before you upload it,
[01:59:31.600 --> 01:59:34.880]   before it's not before it's upload, before it's published.
[01:59:34.880 --> 01:59:36.720]   So you can see if you're going to face any problems.
[01:59:36.720 --> 01:59:38.640]   So there you go.
[01:59:38.640 --> 01:59:39.040]   Look at that.
[01:59:39.040 --> 01:59:40.800]   Seems like this has been in place for a while
[01:59:40.800 --> 01:59:45.280]   because I would stage some of my uploads and just put them in unlisted.
[01:59:45.280 --> 01:59:48.720]   And every now and then I'd get a notification about something being.
[01:59:48.720 --> 01:59:49.280]   Oh, that's right.
[01:59:49.280 --> 01:59:50.080]   That's right.
[01:59:50.080 --> 01:59:56.240]   Well, this is explicit now and we will check your video for any issues
[01:59:56.240 --> 01:59:59.200]   that may restrict its visibility or monetization.
[01:59:59.200 --> 02:00:03.520]   So, and did you get strikes against you for having violations if you did that?
[02:00:03.520 --> 02:00:04.560]   No, sir.
[02:00:04.560 --> 02:00:05.600]   I have no strikes.
[02:00:05.600 --> 02:00:08.640]   And usually when I did get those notifications,
[02:00:08.640 --> 02:00:12.640]   I could appeal it because I did have written consent from the artists.
[02:00:12.640 --> 02:00:15.600]   So I'll cover it.
[02:00:17.360 --> 02:00:24.000]   Quibi was such a huge success in the US that now YouTube is running as a rolling out YouTube shorts.
[02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:27.040]   Little sounds like a peril.
[02:00:27.040 --> 02:00:31.200]   You're wearing your YouTube shorts?
[02:00:31.200 --> 02:00:32.000]   Summertime.
[02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:33.280]   Time for my YouTube shorts.
[02:00:33.280 --> 02:00:33.680]   Yeah.
[02:00:33.680 --> 02:00:38.560]   Now actually nine to five people which had this story now says the blog post was dated for Thursday
[02:00:38.560 --> 02:00:39.760]   but has since been pulled.
[02:00:39.760 --> 02:00:42.160]   Let's see if we can see this.
[02:00:42.160 --> 02:00:44.240]   The blog.youtube.com post.
[02:00:44.240 --> 02:00:44.880]   Yep.
[02:00:44.880 --> 02:00:45.920]   Doesn't exist anymore.
[02:00:45.920 --> 02:00:49.040]   So maybe YouTube shorts are not rolling out.
[02:00:49.040 --> 02:00:53.520]   Watch this space.
[02:00:53.520 --> 02:00:56.080]   The Google.
[02:00:56.080 --> 02:00:58.880]   I still want them.
[02:00:58.880 --> 02:01:00.160]   I want my YouTube shorts.
[02:01:00.160 --> 02:01:03.680]   Google family link letting parents set always allowed apps.
[02:01:03.680 --> 02:01:07.360]   Get more detailed activity reports.
[02:01:07.360 --> 02:01:14.480]   Family link is a program you install from the play store from Google that will tell parents
[02:01:14.480 --> 02:01:18.320]   how kids are using devices and let them designate.
[02:01:18.320 --> 02:01:19.440]   Some apps is okay.
[02:01:19.440 --> 02:01:21.360]   Some apps not.
[02:01:21.360 --> 02:01:27.200]   You can even say now there's some apps that even after the screen time limit is up you can use these apps.
[02:01:27.200 --> 02:01:31.520]   So more control in the family link app.
[02:01:31.520 --> 02:01:35.360]   The company also launched a site families.google
[02:01:35.360 --> 02:01:43.040]   which is a one stop technology resource to help you make technology work for your family.
[02:01:43.680 --> 02:01:44.720]   Aww.
[02:01:44.720 --> 02:01:47.600]   If that baby is using technology you got a problem.
[02:01:47.600 --> 02:01:49.120]   Aww.
[02:01:49.120 --> 02:01:52.480]   Kid put flowers in my beard.
[02:01:52.480 --> 02:01:57.680]   What are families asking Google how much screen time is too much for my kids?
[02:01:57.680 --> 02:02:05.280]   They've been asking them 217% more times this year than last.
[02:02:05.280 --> 02:02:12.240]   That question considering nobody knows how much is too much nowadays.
[02:02:12.240 --> 02:02:13.280]   Yeah what's the answer?
[02:02:13.280 --> 02:02:14.000]   I don't know.
[02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:16.720]   People actually sit down and ask questions like that of Google.
[02:02:16.720 --> 02:02:17.600]   Sure don't you?
[02:02:17.600 --> 02:02:18.880]   No.
[02:02:18.880 --> 02:02:22.800]   Well I mean how old is Google searches?
[02:02:22.800 --> 02:02:25.200]   They are always stuff like that.
[02:02:25.200 --> 02:02:25.440]   Yeah.
[02:02:25.440 --> 02:02:26.000]   Really?
[02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:27.760]   They're really weird.
[02:02:27.760 --> 02:02:30.800]   How old is Jane Fonda?
[02:02:30.800 --> 02:02:31.520]   Things like that.
[02:02:31.520 --> 02:02:32.800]   Yeah.
[02:02:32.800 --> 02:02:33.680]   We do a lot of that.
[02:02:33.680 --> 02:02:37.680]   And yeah all the time Lisa says no no no she's older than you.
[02:02:37.680 --> 02:02:39.040]   No she's not.
[02:02:39.040 --> 02:02:39.760]   Yes she is.
[02:02:40.320 --> 02:02:42.960]   How hey Google how old is Jane Fonda?
[02:02:42.960 --> 02:02:44.800]   And the you know Betsch...
[02:02:44.800 --> 02:02:45.280]   Oh you jerk.
[02:02:45.280 --> 02:02:54.880]   Now a lot of wives around America are going to say why were you asking about Jane Fonda?
[02:02:54.880 --> 02:02:57.840]   I see it in your history.
[02:02:57.840 --> 02:03:01.440]   I watched the China syndrome the other day.
[02:03:01.440 --> 02:03:03.600]   That's aged quite well with Jack Lemon.
[02:03:03.600 --> 02:03:04.960]   It's a yeah.
[02:03:04.960 --> 02:03:10.160]   Crazy nuclear power plant operator who barricaded himself inside the control room.
[02:03:10.160 --> 02:03:11.360]   Inspiration for the Simpsons.
[02:03:11.360 --> 02:03:12.400]   No.
[02:03:12.400 --> 02:03:13.120]   It could have been.
[02:03:13.120 --> 02:03:15.440]   It was a good movie.
[02:03:15.440 --> 02:03:16.800]   Michael Douglas produced it.
[02:03:16.800 --> 02:03:17.840]   He was in it.
[02:03:17.840 --> 02:03:18.880]   Jane Fonda.
[02:03:18.880 --> 02:03:19.520]   Jack Lemon.
[02:03:19.520 --> 02:03:23.760]   Brilliant thread.
[02:03:23.760 --> 02:03:24.640]   This sounds like you.
[02:03:24.640 --> 02:03:25.360]   Are you blue?
[02:03:25.360 --> 02:03:26.960]   I put a blue box in there.
[02:03:26.960 --> 02:03:27.280]   I love it.
[02:03:27.280 --> 02:03:28.000]   Jeff was blue.
[02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:31.040]   Brilliant thread on why...
[02:03:31.040 --> 02:03:33.040]   Did we have to close the change log?
[02:03:33.040 --> 02:03:34.400]   Yeah didn't we?
[02:03:34.400 --> 02:03:35.360]   Did I play the drums?
[02:03:35.360 --> 02:03:35.520]   No.
[02:03:35.520 --> 02:03:37.280]   And that's...
[02:03:37.280 --> 02:03:38.160]   I said it.
[02:03:38.160 --> 02:03:39.840]   And that's the Google change log.
[02:03:39.840 --> 02:03:41.520]   Like it matters.
[02:03:41.520 --> 02:03:42.000]   We got it.
[02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:43.040]   It does matter.
[02:03:43.040 --> 02:03:46.880]   Like the universe is never going to be in order again.
[02:03:46.880 --> 02:03:49.120]   It's leaving open the change log.
[02:03:49.120 --> 02:03:51.680]   Let's hit all kinds of trolls and nasty animals.
[02:03:51.680 --> 02:03:52.320]   Yeah it's off.
[02:03:52.320 --> 02:03:56.720]   Jason if you can just delete Jack right now.
[02:03:56.720 --> 02:04:00.000]   Just making...
[02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:00.640]   making...
[02:04:00.640 --> 02:04:02.160]   making Jason's life hard.
[02:04:02.160 --> 02:04:02.800]   Let's not do that.
[02:04:02.800 --> 02:04:05.600]   If we didn't have that bumper I would have been walking a little bit
[02:04:05.600 --> 02:04:08.320]   cricket the rest of the day because I've been off balance.
[02:04:08.320 --> 02:04:09.040]   So...
[02:04:09.040 --> 02:04:17.280]   Did you see the one minute 26 second drone video of a bowling alley to promote it
[02:04:17.280 --> 02:04:20.160]   that got Hollywood all excited.
[02:04:20.160 --> 02:04:22.160]   One Hollywood veteran said...
[02:04:22.160 --> 02:04:27.360]   It adds to the language and vocabulary of cinema.
[02:04:27.360 --> 02:04:30.720]   Wow that's a lot.
[02:04:30.720 --> 02:04:33.680]   I want Anne's professional view of this.
[02:04:33.680 --> 02:04:35.920]   All right this is using...
[02:04:35.920 --> 02:04:38.000]   By the way get ready because you can see a lot more of this.
[02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:39.520]   My son Henry is really into this.
[02:04:39.520 --> 02:04:41.440]   FBE.
[02:04:41.440 --> 02:04:43.520]   First person video drones.
[02:04:43.520 --> 02:04:44.640]   They are hard to fly.
[02:04:44.640 --> 02:04:52.080]   You have to put on a VR helmet because you're moving super fast through tiny spots.
[02:04:52.080 --> 02:04:55.760]   And so you put the helmet on so you feel like you're in the drone.
[02:04:55.760 --> 02:04:59.520]   Drone racing used it at first but now they're doing it for video.
[02:04:59.520 --> 02:05:00.320]   And it makes...
[02:05:00.320 --> 02:05:00.880]   Watch this.
[02:05:00.880 --> 02:05:04.320]   It makes dramatic fantastic video.
[02:05:04.960 --> 02:05:05.840]   Very hard to do.
[02:05:05.840 --> 02:05:10.240]   Henry's been doing a simulator for months to learn because it's so hard to do.
[02:05:10.240 --> 02:05:12.160]   Let me turn on the sound on this too.
[02:05:12.160 --> 02:05:15.760]   So here we go into the Bryant Lane bowling alley.
[02:05:15.760 --> 02:05:18.240]   It's just amazing.
[02:05:18.240 --> 02:05:22.320]   There's no way you could do this with a steady cam or with any...
[02:05:22.320 --> 02:05:25.440]   You have to have an FPV drone.
[02:05:25.440 --> 02:05:28.080]   Oh it gets tinier too so he's flying around the alley.
[02:05:28.080 --> 02:05:34.000]   There's by the way really this is so well done because there's people talking about
[02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:35.840]   things from the big Lebowski.
[02:05:35.840 --> 02:05:37.040]   There's all sorts of references.
[02:05:37.040 --> 02:05:40.240]   Look we're now actually in the pin resetting machinery.
[02:05:40.240 --> 02:05:41.680]   It's beautiful.
[02:05:41.680 --> 02:05:47.760]   I like this one better than even one Mercedes.
[02:05:47.760 --> 02:05:48.160]   Look at that.
[02:05:48.160 --> 02:05:53.200]   Ooh it's just going right through the guys legs underneath the bowling thing.
[02:05:53.200 --> 02:05:58.800]   It's really really cool and this is a lot of work to do this.
[02:05:58.800 --> 02:06:03.440]   But the thing is because you're wearing a VR helmet you could be somewhere completely
[02:06:03.440 --> 02:06:04.080]   invisible.
[02:06:04.080 --> 02:06:06.960]   And it's turning around.
[02:06:06.960 --> 02:06:08.400]   It's doing a 360 as it goes.
[02:06:08.400 --> 02:06:08.880]   Yeah yeah.
[02:06:08.880 --> 02:06:11.520]   They are doing the lines probably big when I was getting.
[02:06:11.520 --> 02:06:13.680]   Yeah they're doing the big Lebowski.
[02:06:13.680 --> 02:06:14.960]   This is bowling.
[02:06:14.960 --> 02:06:16.080]   They're rules.
[02:06:16.080 --> 02:06:16.560]   They're rules.
[02:06:16.560 --> 02:06:18.640]   They're rules Donnie.
[02:06:18.640 --> 02:06:25.440]   Having that much.
[02:06:25.440 --> 02:06:26.240]   Great finish.
[02:06:26.240 --> 02:06:27.120]   Just getting ready to watch.
[02:06:27.120 --> 02:06:27.840]   Here comes the ball.
[02:06:27.840 --> 02:06:28.400]   He's rolling.
[02:06:28.400 --> 02:06:28.960]   He's rolling.
[02:06:28.960 --> 02:06:29.600]   Strike!
[02:06:32.320 --> 02:06:33.120]   Now the drone.
[02:06:33.120 --> 02:06:37.680]   By the way that's a $1,000 drone that's going to get squished by a bowling pin machine.
[02:06:37.680 --> 02:06:38.160]   Worth it.
[02:06:38.160 --> 02:06:39.600]   That's so awesome.
[02:06:39.600 --> 02:06:43.040]   The skill to be able to do that.
[02:06:43.040 --> 02:06:45.600]   But if what people tend to forgive this happened.
[02:06:45.600 --> 02:06:47.360]   Well that's all right.
[02:06:47.360 --> 02:06:51.520]   That was another story about the pilot seeing a UFO.
[02:06:51.520 --> 02:06:52.960]   That's I don't know why that.
[02:06:52.960 --> 02:06:53.520]   Yeah go ahead.
[02:06:53.520 --> 02:06:58.240]   The key with those is not only the transmitter but the goggles like you mentioned.
[02:06:58.240 --> 02:07:00.800]   You can't have any kind of latency on that.
[02:07:00.800 --> 02:07:03.280]   And I've tried to speed the opening.
[02:07:03.280 --> 02:07:03.840]   Oh yeah it was.
[02:07:03.840 --> 02:07:06.320]   It was so hard.
[02:07:06.320 --> 02:07:06.880]   It was really hard.
[02:07:06.880 --> 02:07:10.160]   The latency now gets sick within a couple of minutes.
[02:07:10.160 --> 02:07:13.040]   But take the goggles off and tell me to fly it.
[02:07:13.040 --> 02:07:13.520]   I could fly it.
[02:07:13.520 --> 02:07:14.320]   I got him.
[02:07:14.320 --> 02:07:14.640]   I got him.
[02:07:14.640 --> 02:07:15.760]   He had a lot of power.
[02:07:15.760 --> 02:07:17.520]   And FPV drone for Christmas.
[02:07:17.520 --> 02:07:19.440]   But he hasn't dared to fly it because they're expensive.
[02:07:19.440 --> 02:07:21.680]   And he's really crazy.
[02:07:21.680 --> 02:07:22.240]   He crashed it.
[02:07:22.240 --> 02:07:26.240]   So you can crash them quite quickly because they're going so fast.

[02:07:32.000 --> 02:07:33.920]   He's Jaybird.
[02:07:33.920 --> 02:07:37.840]   Because he's in a way because they're fine.
[02:07:37.840 --> 02:07:42.480]   I mean that in itself is like being a director because you're organizing.
[02:07:42.480 --> 02:07:42.960]   The whole thing.
[02:07:42.960 --> 02:07:45.200]   You've got to plan on the shot before hand and do.
[02:07:45.200 --> 02:07:46.640]   He's good.
[02:07:46.640 --> 02:07:47.920]   Here is it.
[02:07:47.920 --> 02:07:51.680]   Just if you want to know what it looks like when you're wearing this stuff.
[02:07:51.680 --> 02:07:53.120]   It's.
[02:07:53.120 --> 02:07:54.640]   Yeah there you go.
[02:07:54.640 --> 02:07:54.960]   Yeah.
[02:07:54.960 --> 02:07:55.440]   Yeah.
[02:07:55.440 --> 02:07:56.080]   Yeah.
[02:07:56.080 --> 02:07:56.960]   Pretty cool.
[02:07:56.960 --> 02:07:58.720]   Pretty cool.
[02:07:58.720 --> 02:08:00.720]   That's some real skill.
[02:08:00.720 --> 02:08:03.120]   All right.
[02:08:03.120 --> 02:08:05.680]   I didn't get to all the greens let alone all the blues.
[02:08:05.680 --> 02:08:06.080]   Do we.
[02:08:06.080 --> 02:08:09.520]   Are there any stories that I left out that we really want to do here?
[02:08:09.520 --> 02:08:11.920]   Uber.
[02:08:11.920 --> 02:08:13.600]   Is that an Uber story?
[02:08:13.600 --> 02:08:16.720]   I don't know if it's in a dump but it was in my brain.
[02:08:16.720 --> 02:08:18.720]   Oh what are they doing now?
[02:08:18.720 --> 02:08:20.880]   Is it green in your brain or is it blue in your brain?
[02:08:22.880 --> 02:08:27.440]   Well it was green considering we're in California and all of those propositions
[02:08:27.440 --> 02:08:31.520]   and stuff that we just recently fought for gig workers but now.
[02:08:31.520 --> 02:08:32.480]   Prop 22.
[02:08:32.480 --> 02:08:32.720]   Yeah.
[02:08:32.720 --> 02:08:42.320]   UK Uber is setting up employees over there and mandatory vacation pay and all that good stuff.
[02:08:42.320 --> 02:08:43.760]   They basically.
[02:08:43.760 --> 02:08:44.160]   It's in the dump.
[02:08:44.160 --> 02:08:44.880]   They have to.
[02:08:44.880 --> 02:08:48.240]   It isn't in the dock but it should have been.
[02:08:48.240 --> 02:08:48.880]   You're right.
[02:08:48.880 --> 02:08:51.840]   They're going to get minimum wage holiday pay and pensions and you know what?
[02:08:51.840 --> 02:08:54.640]   God bless Uber because it said.
[02:08:54.640 --> 02:08:55.520]   34.
[02:08:55.520 --> 02:08:56.320]   It said oh it isn't.
[02:08:56.320 --> 02:08:56.880]   What's it for?
[02:08:56.880 --> 02:08:58.800]   They said yeah it's time.
[02:08:58.800 --> 02:09:06.560]   The CEO Dara Khoshwoshwahiy said this is a significant improvement in the standard of workers
[02:09:06.560 --> 02:09:12.720]   work for UK drivers but I know many observers won't pat us on the back for taking this step
[02:09:12.720 --> 02:09:15.280]   which comes after a five year legal battle.
[02:09:15.280 --> 02:09:19.280]   Remember he joined after this legal battle was joined.
[02:09:19.280 --> 02:09:25.600]   They have a point though I hope the path that we chose shows our willingness to change.
[02:09:25.600 --> 02:09:28.240]   So I hope that's true.
[02:09:28.240 --> 02:09:32.880]   I hope Uber is saying yeah you know what we we owe this to our drivers.
[02:09:32.880 --> 02:09:40.800]   You know what when I read into it more I thought about how I felt with the in flexible
[02:09:40.800 --> 02:09:44.400]   as a contractor and independent contractor.
[02:09:44.400 --> 02:09:49.840]   I wonder I mean I think they actually said yeah we'll still have air quotes flexibility for these
[02:09:49.840 --> 02:09:55.040]   employees but just just how far can they go with that because you know if you're just an
[02:09:55.040 --> 02:09:58.960]   independent contractor you literally just don't even have to turn the app on to say
[02:09:58.960 --> 02:10:01.040]   going to drive today.
[02:10:01.040 --> 02:10:04.960]   Yeah at this point if you're going to get vacation pay and you're going to get minimum wage
[02:10:04.960 --> 02:10:08.080]   you might have a requirement they might have a requirement for.
[02:10:08.080 --> 02:10:10.640]   Yeah I don't know.
[02:10:10.640 --> 02:10:11.440]   That's a good thing.
[02:10:11.440 --> 02:10:16.240]   And when will the next vote come for over here in the US and you know they try to make that
[02:10:16.240 --> 02:10:17.360]   precedence.
[02:10:17.360 --> 02:10:24.960]   I think by now everybody understands that Uber you know the whole business model of Uber is
[02:10:24.960 --> 02:10:30.720]   that you know you take advantage of the drivers as much as they'll let you.
[02:10:30.720 --> 02:10:34.240]   You know you can't go too far because they'll stop working for you but you get away with as
[02:10:34.240 --> 02:10:38.480]   much as you can that you know you're already losing money you're trying to lose less money.
[02:10:39.280 --> 02:10:45.120]   So you know it's not like the minimum wage you're going to get is a lot it's $12.40
[02:10:45.120 --> 02:10:50.960]   and it starts the time they accept the ride request that's another thing people wanted
[02:10:50.960 --> 02:10:52.560]   and they drop off the passenger.
[02:10:52.560 --> 02:10:56.640]   Doesn't apply to the time that you're waiting for a request though.
[02:10:56.640 --> 02:11:02.160]   Yeah so they then they're only guaranteeing that you'll make that much.
[02:11:02.160 --> 02:11:05.680]   Oh I see how they're going to do it.
[02:11:05.680 --> 02:11:08.880]   Uber will pay drivers on vacation 12% of their earnings.
[02:11:09.520 --> 02:11:15.040]   That's not a lot but that's the thing you know if you only do it one day a week well you're not
[02:11:15.040 --> 02:11:17.120]   going to get two weeks pay.
[02:11:17.120 --> 02:11:17.680]   Right.
[02:11:17.680 --> 02:11:18.560]   For your previous insurance.
[02:11:18.560 --> 02:11:21.760]   But if you only do it one way a week or one day a week you're not the person that's
[02:11:21.760 --> 02:11:22.240]   right.
[02:11:22.240 --> 02:11:24.960]   You're the happy gig worker who's doing it because they just want to make
[02:11:24.960 --> 02:11:26.400]   extra money as opposed to.
[02:11:26.400 --> 02:11:29.440]   I think that was the answer point I mean he's standing up for gig workers.
[02:11:29.440 --> 02:11:30.880]   Yep.
[02:11:30.880 --> 02:11:33.840]   And I think that's freedom.
[02:11:33.840 --> 02:11:35.840]   I feel like there should be avenues for both.
[02:11:35.840 --> 02:11:36.720]   I mean like you know
[02:11:38.560 --> 02:11:42.800]   Uber has the data they know exactly when they need more drivers on the road right.
[02:11:42.800 --> 02:11:47.680]   And you could have employees cover those shifts and then you know
[02:11:47.680 --> 02:11:53.360]   or have employees that are there during that time and then have your gig folks do
[02:11:53.360 --> 02:11:56.080]   whenever else you know.
[02:11:56.080 --> 02:11:58.960]   Anyway I don't know I just ignore me.
[02:11:58.960 --> 02:12:03.360]   Yeah and again the employees do have rights but
[02:12:03.360 --> 02:12:07.760]   if you don't want to be an employee that's a right you have to.
[02:12:08.640 --> 02:12:10.080]   You can use a choice.
[02:12:10.080 --> 02:12:16.640]   Yeah but I will say there are lots of people who are stuck in untenable situations.
[02:12:16.640 --> 02:12:17.840]   Not just because of the error.
[02:12:17.840 --> 02:12:22.160]   It's taking advantage of a societal shift that we've gone through.
[02:12:22.160 --> 02:12:23.440]   Yeah.
[02:12:23.440 --> 02:12:27.600]   That means people just don't have good employment anymore.
[02:12:27.600 --> 02:12:32.160]   And I mean is it Uber's fault for capitalizing on that?
[02:12:32.160 --> 02:12:33.840]   Right.
[02:12:35.840 --> 02:12:41.920]   Well I mean let's face it Uber can't make money unless self-driving vehicles emerge.
[02:12:41.920 --> 02:12:46.960]   Drivers cost too much and this just makes them even less desirable.
[02:12:46.960 --> 02:12:50.960]   They lose a lot of money per ride because the drivers cost so much.
[02:12:50.960 --> 02:12:52.800]   They can never make money.
[02:12:52.800 --> 02:12:55.440]   Some people say we'll never make money by the way.
[02:12:55.440 --> 02:13:00.560]   There's definitely a contingent of people who think Uber is just never been designed to make money ever.
[02:13:00.560 --> 02:13:03.040]   But certainly drivers don't help.
[02:13:04.080 --> 02:13:06.720]   With that said how are they able to go public?
[02:13:06.720 --> 02:13:09.040]   How are they able to hire people?
[02:13:09.040 --> 02:13:14.160]   Same people who buy people's painting for 70 million dollars.
[02:13:14.160 --> 02:13:17.200]   Message received.
[02:13:17.200 --> 02:13:24.320]   If you believe that Uber is the future and I can see how people might have believed that.
[02:13:24.320 --> 02:13:25.760]   But I think more and more people are.
[02:13:25.760 --> 02:13:27.680]   You know the shorts are saying come on.
[02:13:27.680 --> 02:13:30.160]   I'm not going to get involved.
[02:13:30.160 --> 02:13:32.240]   I don't know any Uber Scott stock.
[02:13:32.240 --> 02:13:36.720]   Alright I want to do some pics of the week and let Stacy go and enjoy her meal.
[02:13:36.720 --> 02:13:39.200]   And Jeff tried to find some kachio.
[02:13:39.200 --> 02:13:42.080]   I pepe and I don't know it takes a week.
[02:13:42.080 --> 02:13:42.880]   It takes a week.
[02:13:42.880 --> 02:13:44.480]   Yeah I don't do it every week.
[02:13:44.480 --> 02:13:46.080]   I don't know it's Stacy.
[02:13:46.080 --> 02:13:47.040]   No I don't do it every week.
[02:13:47.040 --> 02:13:49.680]   I was worried about me.
[02:13:49.680 --> 02:13:51.600]   Beforehand it was salad.
[02:13:51.600 --> 02:13:52.560]   Now it's pizza.
[02:13:52.560 --> 02:13:54.160]   No it was a beer.
[02:13:54.160 --> 02:13:55.600]   It was a salad first.
[02:13:55.600 --> 02:13:56.800]   That was salad.
[02:13:56.800 --> 02:13:57.600]   No I have a pizza.
[02:13:57.600 --> 02:13:58.480]   What's wrong with this?
[02:13:58.480 --> 02:14:03.680]   Here's what they tell me on Noom if you eat the salad first you'll eat less pizza and joy.
[02:14:03.680 --> 02:14:05.600]   And there's no bad foods.
[02:14:05.600 --> 02:14:07.120]   Amen.
[02:14:07.120 --> 02:14:08.080]   No they're so bad foods.
[02:14:08.080 --> 02:14:10.560]   But weekly kachio.
[02:14:10.560 --> 02:14:14.160]   Pepe or possibly more often given how much Jeff's is it.
[02:14:14.160 --> 02:14:15.520]   No it's every other week.
[02:14:15.520 --> 02:14:17.520]   It's every other week.
[02:14:17.520 --> 02:14:20.720]   And then the bi-weeks are pizzas now?
[02:14:20.720 --> 02:14:23.120]   Here you go.
[02:14:23.120 --> 02:14:24.160]   Now that's living.
[02:14:24.160 --> 02:14:27.680]   When is Chicago Hot Dog Monday?
[02:14:27.680 --> 02:14:29.120]   That's the one I want to be there for.
[02:14:29.120 --> 02:14:30.560]   Well here's the problem.
[02:14:30.560 --> 02:14:32.400]   Once my wife.
[02:14:32.400 --> 02:14:36.880]   Even though I've had the vaccination I act as if I don't.
[02:14:36.880 --> 02:14:36.880]   No.
[02:14:36.880 --> 02:14:37.680]   The wife and daughter.
[02:14:37.680 --> 02:14:38.320]   Rightly so.
[02:14:38.320 --> 02:14:38.480]   Right.
[02:14:38.480 --> 02:14:38.800]   Yes.
[02:14:38.800 --> 02:14:43.120]   When I can escape the bondage of.
[02:14:43.120 --> 02:14:46.320]   Don't tell my word first.
[02:14:46.320 --> 02:14:49.520]   When I can escape the bondage of the pandemic.
[02:14:49.520 --> 02:14:51.120]   God bless science.
[02:14:51.120 --> 02:14:57.440]   I already learned the Taco Bell being burritos aren't as good as I remembered.
[02:14:58.240 --> 02:15:00.960]   I would love a little pepperoni on a pizza.
[02:15:00.960 --> 02:15:01.440]   Just one.
[02:15:01.440 --> 02:15:03.520]   Just one slice.
[02:15:03.520 --> 02:15:05.680]   There are no bad foods Jeff.
[02:15:05.680 --> 02:15:07.360]   Just bad people.
[02:15:07.360 --> 02:15:09.120]   No that's wrong.
[02:15:09.120 --> 02:15:10.560]   That's not the rule.
[02:15:10.560 --> 02:15:16.640]   All right coming up our picks of the week.
[02:15:16.640 --> 02:15:17.360]   Our numbers of the week.
[02:15:17.360 --> 02:15:19.120]   Prepare your picks.
[02:15:19.120 --> 02:15:24.320]   Let's kick off the picks of the week this week with Stacy Higgin-Botham's.
[02:15:24.320 --> 02:15:27.360]   We've missed it for two whole weeks thing of the week.
[02:15:27.360 --> 02:15:31.520]   Okay so it is not.
[02:15:31.520 --> 02:15:36.160]   It is not a thing.
[02:15:36.160 --> 02:15:36.640]   Okay.
[02:15:36.640 --> 02:15:38.480]   Actually yeah you know what I lied to you.
[02:15:38.480 --> 02:15:39.680]   It is a thing.
[02:15:39.680 --> 02:15:40.800]   We're going to do a thing this week.
[02:15:40.800 --> 02:15:43.440]   I don't like sure.
[02:15:43.440 --> 02:15:46.560]   I installed the easy to install.
[02:15:46.560 --> 02:15:50.000]   299 fin let me tell you what it is.
[02:15:50.000 --> 02:15:51.120]   It's.
[02:15:51.120 --> 02:15:54.000]   Okay I can't spell sorry.
[02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:56.000]   199 or $2.99.
[02:15:56.000 --> 02:15:59.360]   299.
[02:15:59.360 --> 02:16:00.800]   Come on there's a chip in there.
[02:16:00.800 --> 02:16:08.720]   So I just want to it's the fin smart water assistant.
[02:16:08.720 --> 02:16:13.600]   And so this device you can install anybody can install it.
[02:16:13.600 --> 02:16:14.400]   You don't need a plumber.
[02:16:14.400 --> 02:16:15.600]   Some of their other devices do.
[02:16:15.600 --> 02:16:17.520]   There is no water shut off though.
[02:16:17.520 --> 02:16:21.440]   So what this does is this analyzes water use throughout the home.
[02:16:22.560 --> 02:16:28.960]   And it will tell me one how much water things are using it looks for leaks.
[02:16:28.960 --> 02:16:31.360]   And what else does it do?
[02:16:31.360 --> 02:16:34.480]   It notifies me if there are leaks.
[02:16:34.480 --> 02:16:39.920]   And yeah I like it because so far I've been able to yell at my daughter when she was taking a are
[02:16:39.920 --> 02:16:42.400]   you all ready for this a 40 minute shower.
[02:16:42.400 --> 02:16:49.920]   Fin was like there is like something happening here and I was like dang what is it.
[02:16:49.920 --> 02:16:53.440]   I'm going around and it was like it's the shower and I go to my shower
[02:16:53.440 --> 02:16:56.480]   and then I go downstairs and I hear my daughter singing in the shower and I'm like.
[02:16:56.480 --> 02:16:58.000]   That's what it means to be a teenager.
[02:16:58.000 --> 02:17:00.320]   Yeah that's not exactly that's in Jesus.
[02:17:00.320 --> 02:17:05.920]   None of your business you're surveilling my shower mom.
[02:17:05.920 --> 02:17:08.400]   I inadvertently found a way to fix that by the way.
[02:17:08.400 --> 02:17:12.720]   I showed my daughter Abby Psycho when she was about seven.
[02:17:12.720 --> 02:17:16.800]   And she never took another shower.
[02:17:17.600 --> 02:17:22.800]   So the year that of the year that's way still a lot more that's operant conditioning.
[02:17:22.800 --> 02:17:27.280]   If she starts to get in the shower go.
[02:17:27.280 --> 02:17:31.440]   So wrong.
[02:17:31.440 --> 02:17:36.320]   All right so that is and if you want if you have a plumber and you want to spend the money
[02:17:36.320 --> 02:17:40.960]   you can get one with an automatic shut off but that is rude because then you're staying
[02:17:40.960 --> 02:17:46.160]   there with soap in your hair and it's cold and no no no no no no it's for leaks like when it
[02:17:46.160 --> 02:17:52.720]   detects the. Oh oh oh oh oh not on your daughter I get it okay because that wouldn't be nice.
[02:17:52.720 --> 02:17:58.080]   I mean if I wanted to I could go and shut the water off but that would be kind of a hardcore thing.
[02:17:58.080 --> 02:18:02.320]   I am so sick and tired of you taking all the hot water.
[02:18:02.320 --> 02:18:07.760]   So oh that's good. So that is that is. You don't have to shut off all the water just the hot water.
[02:18:07.760 --> 02:18:10.960]   Oh and I discovered a leaky toilet.
[02:18:10.960 --> 02:18:13.520]   Okay so when is this thing you're talking about?
[02:18:14.400 --> 02:18:17.200]   It's called the fin smart water assistant.
[02:18:17.200 --> 02:18:22.080]   Two ends in the fin? P Y no PHY end.
[02:18:22.080 --> 02:18:24.320]   Well thank you for spelling and I don't think I would have found that.
[02:18:24.320 --> 02:18:28.000]   No that's that's yeah fine.
[02:18:28.000 --> 02:18:30.000]   It looks like fine too.
[02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:32.400]   Smart. What's that any water assistant?
[02:18:32.400 --> 02:18:34.880]   If you got the PHY end you got everything you need.
[02:18:34.880 --> 02:18:39.680]   So would you put it on one thing and it knows where all the leaks are?
[02:18:39.680 --> 02:18:43.040]   Yeah you're supposed to put it on like your kitchen sink.
[02:18:43.040 --> 02:18:47.760]   I have to put my I don't have power by my kitchen sink so I put it on a bathroom sink.
[02:18:47.760 --> 02:18:50.320]   Oh you have to put on everything that might be leaking?
[02:18:50.320 --> 02:18:53.440]   No no no no no no you just put it in one place.
[02:18:53.440 --> 02:18:56.800]   You just have to find the place to put it and then you give it.
[02:18:56.800 --> 02:18:57.360]   Oh I like this.
[02:18:57.360 --> 02:19:00.800]   I had it now for I mean how do it know?
[02:19:00.800 --> 02:19:04.880]   How do it know? It's algorithms.
[02:19:04.880 --> 02:19:07.440]   It measures the water pressure going through the pipes.
[02:19:07.440 --> 02:19:10.400]   And it can tell well but can it tell where the leak is?
[02:19:11.360 --> 02:19:12.960]   Yes. How does it know?
[02:19:12.960 --> 02:19:18.960]   Once it has a once it knows what's running in your house.
[02:19:18.960 --> 02:19:20.480]   So it's kind of a blooming check.
[02:19:20.480 --> 02:19:23.600]   It's finger if fingerprints your pipe thing.
[02:19:23.600 --> 02:19:25.200]   You pipe pressure.
[02:19:25.200 --> 02:19:27.600]   Yeah fingerprints what is yeah.
[02:19:27.600 --> 02:19:32.960]   Microscopic water pressure changes 240 times a second it measures
[02:19:32.960 --> 02:19:37.600]   to recognize the unique voice of each fixture in your home.
[02:19:37.600 --> 02:19:39.200]   I saw something like this at CES.
[02:19:40.320 --> 02:19:42.880]   So there's another company that does this called Flow.
[02:19:42.880 --> 02:19:44.160]   Yeah that's what I saw.
[02:19:44.160 --> 02:19:44.640]   Yeah.
[02:19:44.640 --> 02:19:45.040]   Yeah.
[02:19:45.040 --> 02:19:46.720]   With a long O over it.
[02:19:46.720 --> 02:19:48.640]   And they teamed up with Moen.
[02:19:48.640 --> 02:19:49.120]   So Finn.
[02:19:49.120 --> 02:19:50.560]   Yeah I saw it at the Moen booth.
[02:19:50.560 --> 02:19:50.560]   Flow.
[02:19:50.560 --> 02:19:51.280]   Yeah.
[02:19:51.280 --> 02:19:51.840]   Yeah.
[02:19:51.840 --> 02:19:53.680]   Both of those they're the same sort of thing.
[02:19:53.680 --> 02:19:55.920]   And then there's a flume.
[02:19:55.920 --> 02:19:56.800]   Hold on I'm gonna.
[02:19:56.800 --> 02:19:59.120]   Finn flow and flume.
[02:19:59.120 --> 02:20:03.520]   It's a hard it's a hard world out there.
[02:20:03.520 --> 02:20:05.040]   I think there's two just.
[02:20:05.040 --> 02:20:07.200]   I think it is flume.
[02:20:07.200 --> 02:20:08.080]   This is cool.
[02:20:08.080 --> 02:20:09.200]   This is really cool.
[02:20:09.200 --> 02:20:10.960]   So I like that for $2.99.
[02:20:10.960 --> 02:20:13.040]   I mean look at a water leak it cost you money.
[02:20:13.040 --> 02:20:15.760]   I'll never forget when I was in college we ran in a big house
[02:20:15.760 --> 02:20:19.520]   from a nice Ukrainian lady named Kratchuk.
[02:20:19.520 --> 02:20:24.240]   And there was a toilet in the basement and we didn't know we used it like at the
[02:20:24.240 --> 02:20:26.080]   beginning of the summer by the end of the summer.
[02:20:26.080 --> 02:20:30.320]   She had like a thousand dollar water bill and came screaming at us.
[02:20:30.320 --> 02:20:34.560]   And it turned out the toilet we had flushed it but it was leaking and it was leaking all summer.
[02:20:34.560 --> 02:20:36.400]   You know toilets will run sometimes.
[02:20:36.400 --> 02:20:38.080]   But it was in the basement so we didn't know.
[02:20:38.080 --> 02:20:40.160]   I felt terrible when I moved.
[02:20:40.160 --> 02:20:43.760]   So that's actually it discovered we had a flapper issue and it was leaking.
[02:20:43.760 --> 02:20:44.720]   A flapper issue.
[02:20:44.720 --> 02:20:44.720]   Yes.
[02:20:44.720 --> 02:20:45.760]   That's exactly right.
[02:20:45.760 --> 02:20:51.680]   So flow logic flume and then there's a company called leak defense.
[02:20:51.680 --> 02:20:55.040]   So if you have Finn for a flume you'll never have flapper failure.
[02:20:55.040 --> 02:20:56.560]   Yes.
[02:20:56.560 --> 02:21:00.240]   Flapper fluctuations.
[02:21:00.240 --> 02:21:05.280]   The flapper fluctuations are final with Finn flow and flume.
[02:21:05.280 --> 02:21:05.520]   Yeah.
[02:21:05.520 --> 02:21:07.520]   [whistling]
[02:21:07.520 --> 02:21:11.680]   I like this.
[02:21:11.680 --> 02:21:13.040]   I think this is actually good.
[02:21:13.040 --> 02:21:16.880]   And you know especially out here in California we can't afford to waste water.
[02:21:16.880 --> 02:21:17.520]   We don't have enough.
[02:21:17.520 --> 02:21:22.000]   So these leaks we should actually they should give us these things.
[02:21:22.000 --> 02:21:25.040]   They could save 70 dollars right now.
[02:21:25.040 --> 02:21:26.960]   You can use pre spring sale.
[02:21:26.960 --> 02:21:32.320]   A lot of insurance companies if you have AIG or Chub.
[02:21:32.320 --> 02:21:33.760]   Oh those are some fancy insurance companies.
[02:21:33.760 --> 02:21:34.960]   We used to have Chub.
[02:21:34.960 --> 02:21:35.200]   Yeah.
[02:21:35.200 --> 02:21:36.640]   They were fancy.
[02:21:36.640 --> 02:21:37.760]   Yeah well they'll give you a discount.
[02:21:37.760 --> 02:21:38.560]   Yeah they ought to.
[02:21:38.560 --> 02:21:45.600]   But you got to get a plumber to install this right or could you do this yourself?
[02:21:45.600 --> 02:21:51.200]   Okay the one that I have the 299 one and that does not have water shut off.
[02:21:51.200 --> 02:21:52.160]   That's very important.
[02:21:52.160 --> 02:21:56.560]   So this does this will let me know but it is not going to shut off my water.
[02:21:56.560 --> 02:21:58.560]   That one does not need a plumber.
[02:21:58.560 --> 02:21:59.040]   Nice.
[02:21:59.040 --> 02:21:59.840]   No plumber necessary.
[02:21:59.840 --> 02:22:00.640]   All the ones.
[02:22:00.640 --> 02:22:02.560]   Turn off the water under the sink.
[02:22:02.560 --> 02:22:05.360]   Unthread the hot and cold water hoses from the supply lines
[02:22:05.360 --> 02:22:07.280]   and insert fin sensors.
[02:22:07.280 --> 02:22:10.320]   Connect the device to Wi-Fi and you're good to go well that doesn't look too hard.
[02:22:10.320 --> 02:22:11.040]   I could probably do.
[02:22:11.040 --> 02:22:12.400]   No it's not it's very easy.
[02:22:12.400 --> 02:22:14.560]   But as you say you need a plug socket near there.
[02:22:14.560 --> 02:22:16.320]   Yes.
[02:22:16.320 --> 02:22:19.040]   Does it matter where on the water supply you put it?
[02:22:19.040 --> 02:22:23.920]   You know you just need something with the hot water and a cold water.
[02:22:23.920 --> 02:22:28.800]   And it should be it should be something that's used relatively often.
[02:22:28.800 --> 02:22:29.600]   Oh.
[02:22:29.600 --> 02:22:31.040]   That's why they recommend the kitchen sink.
[02:22:31.040 --> 02:22:32.000]   Because I use it a lot.
[02:22:32.000 --> 02:22:32.240]   Right.
[02:22:32.240 --> 02:22:33.920]   Cool.
[02:22:33.920 --> 02:22:38.320]   But like even your you know any bathroom sink should work.
[02:22:38.320 --> 02:22:40.320]   So fin plus is the one with the shut off.
[02:22:40.320 --> 02:22:42.400]   That needs a plumber probably.
[02:22:42.400 --> 02:22:43.760]   So I'm going to just get the fin.
[02:22:43.760 --> 02:22:45.360]   Yeah.
[02:22:45.360 --> 02:22:47.680]   And then don't forget the coupon.
[02:22:47.680 --> 02:22:49.360]   Let's see if that coupon works.
[02:22:49.360 --> 02:22:50.400]   Discount code.
[02:22:50.400 --> 02:22:53.280]   Paste that in pre spring sale.
[02:22:53.280 --> 02:22:58.000]   Brings the price down to 250 bucks actually 229 before tax.
[02:22:58.000 --> 02:22:58.960]   That's not so bad.
[02:23:00.000 --> 02:23:01.200]   Considering what it's saving you.
[02:23:01.200 --> 02:23:03.680]   Jeff Jarvis.
[02:23:03.680 --> 02:23:04.400]   If you have a leak.
[02:23:04.400 --> 02:23:06.080]   If you have a leak.
[02:23:06.080 --> 02:23:07.040]   If you never have a leak.
[02:23:07.040 --> 02:23:07.520]   What's the point?
[02:23:07.520 --> 02:23:08.320]   You never have a leak.
[02:23:08.320 --> 02:23:09.120]   Yeah.
[02:23:09.120 --> 02:23:13.440]   Yes.
[02:23:13.440 --> 02:23:14.960]   So somebody in the chat room saying well.
[02:23:14.960 --> 02:23:18.480]   If you have the sensors going to map these.
[02:23:18.480 --> 02:23:20.000]   Oh if you have a leak what?
[02:23:20.000 --> 02:23:23.680]   Oh if you install this device and you have a leak at that time.
[02:23:23.680 --> 02:23:25.040]   It's just going to suit that's normal.
[02:23:25.040 --> 02:23:26.640]   And a calibration.
[02:23:26.640 --> 02:23:27.280]   No, no, no, no, no.
[02:23:27.280 --> 02:23:27.520]   Right.
[02:23:27.520 --> 02:23:28.400]   It doesn't.
[02:23:28.400 --> 02:23:28.960]   No, no, no.
[02:23:28.960 --> 02:23:29.520]   It doesn't.
[02:23:29.520 --> 02:23:30.160]   That's how it.
[02:23:30.160 --> 02:23:33.680]   So I installed it and it knew that my toilet was working.
[02:23:33.680 --> 02:23:35.600]   Because my toilet was.
[02:23:35.600 --> 02:23:38.080]   It could tell it was running all the time.
[02:23:38.080 --> 02:23:38.320]   It's getting a normally for a toilet.
[02:23:38.320 --> 02:23:39.280]   Yes.
[02:23:39.280 --> 02:23:40.000]   It was like yeah.
[02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:41.760]   This is not a good toilet basically.
[02:23:41.760 --> 02:23:42.400]   Oh okay.
[02:23:42.400 --> 02:23:43.200]   Cool.
[02:23:43.200 --> 02:23:44.160]   That's worse.
[02:23:44.160 --> 02:23:45.200]   It's way cold.
[02:23:45.200 --> 02:23:51.120]   If you leave your faucet running all the time.
[02:23:51.120 --> 02:23:51.840]   Then maybe.
[02:23:51.840 --> 02:23:52.880]   And it might get matted.
[02:23:52.880 --> 02:23:54.480]   It gave me a couple.
[02:23:54.480 --> 02:23:58.800]   You know it did take a like a week or two to tell it what things were.
[02:23:59.680 --> 02:24:01.680]   Because it was like hey we found this.
[02:24:01.680 --> 02:24:02.640]   Is that what is that?
[02:24:02.640 --> 02:24:03.040]   And I'm like.
[02:24:03.040 --> 02:24:05.120]   I don't know.
[02:24:05.120 --> 02:24:07.680]   Good.
[02:24:07.680 --> 02:24:08.160]   Fin.
[02:24:08.160 --> 02:24:08.960]   PHYN.
[02:24:08.960 --> 02:24:14.160]   How would you then determine how would you say okay Fin.
[02:24:14.160 --> 02:24:15.680]   What is it you're telling me?
[02:24:15.680 --> 02:24:16.320]   You have an app.
[02:24:16.320 --> 02:24:17.200]   It happened to you have an app.
[02:24:17.200 --> 02:24:17.840]   So it should.
[02:24:17.840 --> 02:24:18.880]   Yeah the app.
[02:24:18.880 --> 02:24:20.400]   It happened at 2.46 p.m.
[02:24:20.400 --> 02:24:25.680]   You know how do you then tie the it's question to finding out the event.
[02:24:27.040 --> 02:24:30.320]   Well so it only alerts me when it notices weird behavior.
[02:24:30.320 --> 02:24:34.960]   So it's like hey this this is weird.
[02:24:34.960 --> 02:24:35.680]   Do you know what this is.
[02:24:35.680 --> 02:24:36.400]   You have a daughter.
[02:24:36.400 --> 02:24:38.720]   And I'll be like oh yeah that was my shower.
[02:24:38.720 --> 02:24:42.960]   Oh so it doesn't assume it's wrong it just says you know I notice this anomaly.
[02:24:42.960 --> 02:24:44.400]   Yeah.
[02:24:44.400 --> 02:24:48.000]   Right and you'll get I mean it takes it time again to learn.
[02:24:48.000 --> 02:24:55.200]   And when you launch it you also do it's not just a calibration thing it's a plumbing check
[02:24:55.200 --> 02:24:58.080]   where it tries to check your pipes for small leaks.
[02:24:58.080 --> 02:25:01.840]   Hold on it's trying to talk to me.
[02:25:01.840 --> 02:25:03.840]   The app is a little slow I will say that.
[02:25:03.840 --> 02:25:07.840]   And you cannot you know it's nice to be able to see your water usage.
[02:25:07.840 --> 02:25:10.800]   Oh it can tell you water usage too that's good.
[02:25:10.800 --> 02:25:15.440]   Yeah and it gives you the percentage of like we not surprisingly use a lot of
[02:25:15.440 --> 02:25:16.320]   water in the shower.
[02:25:16.320 --> 02:25:16.480]   Yeah.
[02:25:16.480 --> 02:25:16.960]   Yeah.
[02:25:16.960 --> 02:25:17.280]   Yeah.
[02:25:17.280 --> 02:25:18.800]   Oh this is good.
[02:25:18.800 --> 02:25:22.960]   I like this especially if you're in a drought area like we are.
[02:25:24.640 --> 02:25:30.480]   My tip is do not use SMS for two-factor authentication.
[02:25:30.480 --> 02:25:32.640]   If you know anybody who's using it stop.
[02:25:32.640 --> 02:25:37.120]   Joseph Cox writes for vice for the motherboard section.
[02:25:37.120 --> 02:25:40.320]   A hacker got all my texts for $16.
[02:25:40.320 --> 02:25:48.160]   Now I have to say Joseph Cox hired the hacker to demonstrate this lucky 225.
[02:25:48.160 --> 02:25:53.520]   And what he did was it turns out there's a company called Sakari that does business text
[02:25:53.520 --> 02:25:54.320]   messaging.
[02:25:54.320 --> 02:25:58.800]   In order to do that they also need to impersonate your phone number because it's
[02:25:58.800 --> 02:26:02.480]   you know you don't want a business text message to come for somebody else's phone number.
[02:26:02.480 --> 02:26:09.840]   But all you need is a letter of authorization from the owner of the phone number to do that.
[02:26:09.840 --> 02:26:13.120]   And then you can send and receive text messages to that phone number.
[02:26:13.120 --> 02:26:16.480]   The hacker made a fake letter of authorization.
[02:26:17.440 --> 02:26:25.760]   Sakari took it said great and he was able to receive all the text messages going to Cox's phone.
[02:26:25.760 --> 02:26:31.360]   And you know if it had been a real bad guy would have used that to pack two-factor and all sorts
[02:26:31.360 --> 02:26:32.000]   of stuff.
[02:26:32.000 --> 02:26:35.280]   All of this is simple simple hack.
[02:26:35.280 --> 02:26:42.720]   But you know what I'm finding some some I guess you can't call them all merchants but some
[02:26:42.720 --> 02:26:48.480]   things that you log into they don't offer you the ability to use a OTP or something like that.
[02:26:48.480 --> 02:26:51.600]   They it's either an email or SMS.
[02:26:51.600 --> 02:26:55.760]   Yes and so what I'm I know and what I'm saying is send them this
[02:26:55.760 --> 02:27:00.480]   this article from Vice and say my bank does that.
[02:27:00.480 --> 02:27:03.600]   My bank two factor is SMS period.
[02:27:03.600 --> 02:27:05.520]   There's no other way to do it.
[02:27:05.520 --> 02:27:07.360]   They need to they need a note.
[02:27:07.360 --> 02:27:07.600]   Bank.
[02:27:07.600 --> 02:27:09.760]   I don't want to say the name.
[02:27:09.760 --> 02:27:11.600]   What do you want?
[02:27:11.600 --> 02:27:14.480]   Stacey the name and phone number is that what you're looking for?
[02:27:14.480 --> 02:27:15.520]   What is your mother's name?
[02:27:15.520 --> 02:27:18.080]   I need your OCR routing number.
[02:27:18.080 --> 02:27:26.240]   It's really it's just shows you I believe known for a long time SMS is a very poor way to do two
[02:27:26.240 --> 02:27:26.640]   factor.
[02:27:26.640 --> 02:27:26.960]   Yeah.
[02:27:26.960 --> 02:27:33.040]   This just puts it over the top just not you know just don't if you can and you're right and a lot
[02:27:33.040 --> 02:27:37.440]   of companies do so send in this and say can you stop give me some other all you have to do is
[02:27:37.440 --> 02:27:39.440]   give me you know OTP and I'll be happy.
[02:27:39.440 --> 02:27:41.360]   You're absolutely right.
[02:27:41.360 --> 02:27:42.880]   Are you down with OTP?
[02:27:42.880 --> 02:27:42.960]   Yeah.
[02:27:42.960 --> 02:27:43.680]   I'm damn man.
[02:27:43.680 --> 02:27:46.560]   I'm so sorry.
[02:27:46.560 --> 02:27:48.720]   Was that were you doing a song?
[02:27:48.720 --> 02:27:50.560]   Yeah.
[02:27:50.560 --> 02:27:50.960]   It was.
[02:27:50.960 --> 02:27:53.200]   Down with OTP.
[02:27:53.200 --> 02:27:53.760]   Yeah.
[02:27:53.760 --> 02:27:56.000]   Jeff Jarvis number of the week.
[02:27:56.000 --> 02:27:56.240]   Thank you.
[02:27:56.240 --> 02:27:56.240]   Thank you.
[02:27:56.240 --> 02:27:56.560]   Ant.
[02:27:56.560 --> 02:27:58.560]   So yeah.
[02:27:58.560 --> 02:28:02.480]   Stacey goes back to the past with the water net.
[02:28:02.480 --> 02:28:06.480]   And I'm going to go with whale net.
[02:28:06.480 --> 02:28:07.040]   Whale net.
[02:28:07.040 --> 02:28:07.680]   Aquanet.
[02:28:07.680 --> 02:28:08.400]   Aquanet.
[02:28:08.400 --> 02:28:09.920]   Aquanet for sta-
[02:28:09.920 --> 02:28:11.200]   That sounds like you bear spray.
[02:28:11.200 --> 02:28:11.440]   Yeah.
[02:28:11.440 --> 02:28:11.920]   Exactly.
[02:28:11.920 --> 02:28:20.720]   So a new study published by the Royal Society found that whales changed their behavior around
[02:28:20.720 --> 02:28:21.360]   the world.
[02:28:21.360 --> 02:28:22.320]   What?
[02:28:22.320 --> 02:28:24.960]   When attacked by humans in the 19th century.
[02:28:24.960 --> 02:28:25.280]   Oh.
[02:28:25.280 --> 02:28:27.120]   Oh.
[02:28:27.120 --> 02:28:29.120]   And you mean whaling boats.
[02:28:29.120 --> 02:28:29.840]   Whaling boats.
[02:28:29.840 --> 02:28:34.480]   And so after humans started attacking whales orcas where there was the sperm whales only enemy was
[02:28:34.480 --> 02:28:40.640]   the orca and they had a strategy wherein they would circle around and put their tails out to bat
[02:28:40.640 --> 02:28:41.600]   the orcas away.
[02:28:41.600 --> 02:28:46.480]   And that made it very easy for the whalers to kill the whales.
[02:28:46.480 --> 02:28:52.400]   So the whales quickly not only learned but communicated with each other in ways we do not
[02:28:52.400 --> 02:28:52.880]   understand.
[02:28:52.880 --> 02:29:00.560]   So that after a few years the rate of whalers harpoons fell by 58% according to recently
[02:29:00.560 --> 02:29:02.160]   digitized log boats.
[02:29:02.160 --> 02:29:02.720]   Wow.
[02:29:03.600 --> 02:29:04.000]   Wow.
[02:29:04.000 --> 02:29:07.600]   So it was the first.
[02:29:07.600 --> 02:29:13.120]   That they fished them out or something they killed all the ones they could find.
[02:29:13.120 --> 02:29:17.920]   Yeah it wasn't just that they they killed them all but sure it wasn't the first network
[02:29:17.920 --> 02:29:18.960]   trees talk to each other.
[02:29:18.960 --> 02:29:21.360]   They've been doing that for millennia.
[02:29:21.360 --> 02:29:24.560]   Did you guys know that Amazon has a stitch fix?
[02:29:24.560 --> 02:29:26.560]   What's a stitch.
[02:29:26.560 --> 02:29:27.280]   A who?
[02:29:27.280 --> 02:29:29.200]   What is that?
[02:29:29.200 --> 02:29:30.320]   That personal shopping service.
[02:29:32.480 --> 02:29:32.960]   Sorry.
[02:29:32.960 --> 02:29:33.680]   Did no.
[02:29:33.680 --> 02:29:35.360]   I just did just find that out.
[02:29:35.360 --> 02:29:36.960]   Just advertised it to me and I was like yeah.
[02:29:36.960 --> 02:29:43.360]   I had for a long time that that that thing that you take pictures of your outfits.
[02:29:43.360 --> 02:29:45.440]   Didn't I send that to you?
[02:29:45.440 --> 02:29:48.320]   You sent it to me and they killed it they depreciated it.
[02:29:48.320 --> 02:29:49.200]   Oh man.
[02:29:49.200 --> 02:29:52.960]   No longer will it no longer can Jeff Bezos judge my fashion.
[02:29:52.960 --> 02:29:57.920]   I assumed that that was the precursor to stitch fix to something that would help you.
[02:29:57.920 --> 02:30:01.920]   Like why would they want to take all my outfit pictures of my outfit if it wasn't a
[02:30:01.920 --> 02:30:03.680]   suggest something a little better.
[02:30:03.680 --> 02:30:05.520]   Maybe it was to train it.
[02:30:05.520 --> 02:30:06.560]   Oh maybe.
[02:30:06.560 --> 02:30:07.120]   Oh maybe.
[02:30:07.120 --> 02:30:07.680]   It's been trained on that.
[02:30:07.680 --> 02:30:08.080]   Maybe.
[02:30:08.080 --> 02:30:12.400]   Maybe it's not a stylist maybe it's what's left of that Amazon.
[02:30:12.400 --> 02:30:17.920]   This is insider it gave Amazon a good review for its custom t-shirts where you take a picture of
[02:30:17.920 --> 02:30:18.320]   yourself.
[02:30:18.320 --> 02:30:20.640]   Oh and it measures you?
[02:30:20.640 --> 02:30:21.840]   Yeah.
[02:30:21.840 --> 02:30:25.600]   Yeah that's that was our sponsor boy they sent me I'll wear it next Wednesday.
[02:30:25.600 --> 02:30:28.560]   That was our sponsor member Taylor store do you remember that?
[02:30:28.560 --> 02:30:33.840]   Oh Taylor store and they they had a app that you put on your phone.
[02:30:33.840 --> 02:30:39.760]   I had I they started with shirts and then they did chinos and then they started doing jackets and
[02:30:39.760 --> 02:30:40.080]   suits.
[02:30:40.080 --> 02:30:42.480]   And so I ordered a suit from them and I loved it it came out great.
[02:30:42.480 --> 02:30:46.480]   And they sent me just the a few months ago they sent me a three piece suit.
[02:30:46.480 --> 02:30:47.920]   I'll wear it you'll love it.
[02:30:47.920 --> 02:30:49.920]   Wait a minute I wore it I did wear it.
[02:30:49.920 --> 02:30:52.960]   Didn't I wear it a couple of weeks ago or was that on a Sunday that was on a Sunday.
[02:30:52.960 --> 02:30:53.840]   Well it was a Sunday.
[02:30:53.840 --> 02:30:55.120]   You never dress up for us.
[02:30:55.120 --> 02:30:56.880]   I'll dress up for the big.
[02:30:56.880 --> 02:31:00.000]   I will wear this suit all even where oh it's a beautiful suit.
[02:31:00.000 --> 02:31:03.760]   We're the kids but that's cool right that they take a picture.
[02:31:03.760 --> 02:31:08.800]   Then in this case because it was expensive suit the first one I ordered.
[02:31:08.800 --> 02:31:13.520]   Not that expensive but you know it's a fairly expensive merchandise a few hundred bucks.
[02:31:13.520 --> 02:31:18.000]   They send you a canvas suit that you try it on then you take more pictures and you say it's
[02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:19.200]   a little tiny beautiful.
[02:31:19.200 --> 02:31:23.680]   And then they sent me another one after the feedback and that one fit perfectly.
[02:31:23.680 --> 02:31:28.400]   I said yes ship it and so but now they have my measurements so they sent me another suit.
[02:31:28.400 --> 02:31:29.440]   This is really cool.
[02:31:29.440 --> 02:31:30.000]   I love it.
[02:31:30.000 --> 02:31:30.880]   That's awesome.
[02:31:30.880 --> 02:31:31.120]   Yeah.
[02:31:31.120 --> 02:31:38.240]   Can I play this naughty by nature video or we're going to get in trouble.
[02:31:38.240 --> 02:31:39.200]   We'll get in trouble.
[02:31:39.200 --> 02:31:39.680]   Okay.
[02:31:39.680 --> 02:31:40.160]   Nevermind.
[02:31:40.160 --> 02:31:41.840]   Yeah it's a legit song.
[02:31:41.840 --> 02:31:42.400]   OPP.
[02:31:42.400 --> 02:31:45.200]   Yeah we'll get in trouble.
[02:31:45.200 --> 02:31:46.480]   You down with OPP.
[02:31:46.480 --> 02:31:47.680]   I'm down with OPP.
[02:31:47.680 --> 02:31:48.960]   I don't want to know what it means.
[02:31:48.960 --> 02:31:52.800]   It is Aunt Pruitt's turn for a pig of the week.
[02:31:52.800 --> 02:31:54.320]   I love that number by the way Jeff.
[02:31:54.320 --> 02:31:54.880]   That's cool.
[02:31:54.880 --> 02:32:01.840]   My pig is this morning we did Floss Weekly and had a pretty important person on there.
[02:32:01.840 --> 02:32:02.800]   You ever heard of Drupal?
[02:32:02.800 --> 02:32:05.840]   Yes you have because you're a twit.
[02:32:05.840 --> 02:32:09.200]   If you're on our website you're soaking in it.
[02:32:09.200 --> 02:32:11.440]   So Mr. Geeze.
[02:32:11.440 --> 02:32:11.920]   Do you know he's Drupal?
[02:32:11.920 --> 02:32:12.240]   Yeah.
[02:32:12.240 --> 02:32:14.240]   Bjerke was on the show.
[02:32:14.240 --> 02:32:15.120]   Is there cool?
[02:32:15.120 --> 02:32:18.400]   Doc Seros and Katharine Druckman chatted with him.
[02:32:18.400 --> 02:32:22.560]   She works at Aperia which is actually I think the first hosting company we used for
[02:32:22.560 --> 02:32:24.080]   our website.
[02:32:24.080 --> 02:32:24.480]   Yeah.
[02:32:24.480 --> 02:32:27.920]   It's a Drupal hosting site that Dries founded.
[02:32:27.920 --> 02:32:30.160]   I will listen to this one.
[02:32:30.160 --> 02:32:34.640]   In fact I will listen to this one and the last week you did Tiddly Wiki which is one of my
[02:32:34.640 --> 02:32:35.920]   favorite wikis.
[02:32:35.920 --> 02:32:40.560]   You guys are not going to have a park on Floss Weekly.
[02:32:40.560 --> 02:32:44.800]   Yes Stacey we use the Twit websites Drupal, Tech High Labs Drupal.
[02:32:44.800 --> 02:32:50.240]   When I first started the podcast network I needed a website and I look at all the content
[02:32:50.240 --> 02:32:55.200]   management systems and at the time I was like Drupal two or three I picked it and we've been
[02:32:55.200 --> 02:32:56.480]   using Drupal ever since.
[02:32:56.480 --> 02:32:59.360]   We use a very, we have a very sophisticated Drupal setup.
[02:32:59.360 --> 02:33:00.960]   It's called Headless Drupal.
[02:33:00.960 --> 02:33:05.360]   Our API and our workflow are all run by Drupal in the background.
[02:33:05.360 --> 02:33:07.360]   So yeah.
[02:33:07.360 --> 02:33:07.360]   Wow.
[02:33:07.360 --> 02:33:14.880]   Yeah I remember before I realized that we were, Gigo almost funded by True which had funded WordPress.
[02:33:14.880 --> 02:33:17.440]   I had suggested Drupal and they were like no.
[02:33:17.440 --> 02:33:18.880]   No we use Wordpress.
[02:33:18.880 --> 02:33:20.080]   We use Wordpress.
[02:33:20.080 --> 02:33:22.320]   We're a Wordpress shop.
[02:33:22.320 --> 02:33:27.280]   We should explain Drupal is a content management system.
[02:33:27.280 --> 02:33:29.680]   Kind of like Wordpress it's a way of creating a website.
[02:33:29.680 --> 02:33:34.560]   But as I said we don't have a front end that's running in Drupal only our back end.
[02:33:34.560 --> 02:33:40.400]   The front end is a Node.js website that gets the data from the Drupal API.
[02:33:40.400 --> 02:33:44.480]   There's a whole description of how that works on the website at Twit.tv.
[02:33:44.480 --> 02:33:47.440]   It's really crazy sophisticated.
[02:33:48.480 --> 02:33:49.200]   We really love it.
[02:33:49.200 --> 02:33:52.480]   Did you have another pick too I think?
[02:33:52.480 --> 02:33:53.280]   Yes.
[02:33:53.280 --> 02:33:56.960]   Oh yeah my other pick because you mentioned YouTube shorts and I was like oh yeah I still
[02:33:56.960 --> 02:34:02.560]   have my short out there that I did on my channel youtube.com/antproit.
[02:34:02.560 --> 02:34:07.120]   Still haven't gotten around to shooting another one yet but I want to do more content like this
