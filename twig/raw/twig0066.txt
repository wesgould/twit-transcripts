[00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.640]   It's time for Twig this week in Google
[00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.720]   to show the covers, not just Google,
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.480]   but everything going on in the cloud today.
[00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:47.040]   Joining me, as always, from San Diego, California,
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.720]   it's Gina Trapani.
[00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:49.240]   Hello.
[00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.740]   Hello.
[00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:50.400]   Good to be here.
[00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.280]   Martyrware.org and Fast Company.com.
[00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.080]   And it's good to have you, always, always.
[00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.920]   Great to be here.
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.480]   Also here, Mr. Jeff Jarvis.
[00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.360]   He's a professor of journalism and journalist himself
[00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.160]   and an expert on new media.
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.800]   His blog is--
[00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.000]   Google flute.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.480]   Yeah.
[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.840]   The G, baby, yeah.
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.480]   For many years, I called my fans La Portians.
[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.880]   And we had the La Portia--
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.600]   the sign of the La Portian, which is an L on your forehead
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.240]   until I found out.
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.240]   You're lesbians.
[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.720]   No, we're--
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:21.720]   Losers.
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:22.720]   Losers.
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:23.240]   Oh.
[00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.600]   Glee fans now.
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:25.600]   And Gleak's.
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:26.400]   I'll take lesbians.
[00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.440]   Glee.
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.480]   So maybe I'm all three.
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.160]   I don't know.
[00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.640]   Oh, for Gleak, there's no sense.
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:31.640]   Why is that--
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:32.360]   The-- the-- the-- the-- the--
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.320]   the L in Gleak's--
[00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:34.320]   Oh, because they're losers.
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.840]   Because Gleak-- because anybody in the Gleak Club
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:36.480]   is losers.
[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.480]   That's right.
[00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.200]   Oh, I see.
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.520]   And Mitch Wagner is also here, formerly of a computer world
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.880]   and now a freelancer.
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:43.760]   And he's a--
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.200]   a goo-goo as well.
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.080]   You can find him on Twitter.
[00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.400]   Is that the right salute?
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.080]   We don't know.
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.600]   It's fast.
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:49.480]   It's hard to do the--
[00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.600]   What is G in ASL?
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.120]   And they know?
[00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.440]   Oh, that would be useful.
[00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.760]   The ASL version would be useful.
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:56.960]   So Mitch, welcome to the team.
[00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:58.400]   I understand that you are--
[00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.040]   you are on San Diego as well.
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.160]   Yes, I am a San Diego.
[00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.840]   And whatever we call ourselves, dude.
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:06.840]   That's really cool.
[00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.800]   What was it they said on Anchorman?
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:09.680]   Never mind.
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:12.600]   Stake classy.
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:13.600]   Stake classy.
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:14.240]   Stake classy.
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:15.040]   San Diego.
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:18.160]   And I was about to not.
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.960]   So yeah, I do have a Google TV.
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.520]   And I'm ashamed to say I should--
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.400]   I did not look out for the purposes of this show.
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.600]   And I did not install it last night.
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.120]   Partly because, though, I have to say,
[00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.240]   I've been reading people's reviews.
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.280]   And I've got some trepidation.
[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.920]   I maybe want to keep it in the box so I can return it.
[00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.280]   I bought the logitape review.
[00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.160]   What's the essence of the problem with them in the reviews?
[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.760]   Well, one thing we knew it would be, which is complexity.
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.240]   Danny Sullivan talks about it of search engine land.
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.680]   I can never remember what the new name of it is.
[00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.640]   And he had a long post going, walking through the install.
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.160]   45 minutes just to watch TV.
[00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.600]   And I think that that's part--
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.480]   we knew that that would be an issue.
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.800]   Google TV is--
[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:09.000]   I guess it seems to me that the point of all of these devices
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.520]   is to put internet content on your big screen, right?
[00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:13.800]   In an easy way.
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:15.880]   Google TV added the idea of being
[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.960]   able to search for content anywhere,
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:22.400]   put a browser on it.
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.480]   But it's still the same idea, which is basically
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.160]   an ethernet jack for your TV.
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.520]   The problem is that that means complexity as well.
[00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.360]   You're essentially plugging a computer into your TV.
[00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.640]   In some cases, like the Apple TV, it's very simple,
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:36.200]   but not very powerful.
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.640]   Roku is kind of in the middle there.
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:40.040]   We're more powerful, but a little more complex.
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.960]   Not much more.
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.640]   I think Roku is kind of the sweet spot.
[00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.160]   Then there's media extenders like the Xbox 360
[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:47.560]   or the PlayStation 3.
[00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:52.200]   The real problem that Google TV's got
[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:57.000]   is that ABC and CBS are now blocking their content.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.880]   I know.
[00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.400]   I mean, the whole point of having a browser on the box
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.400]   is that you could go to those networks, right?
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.120]   That air, the last five episodes of whatever show,
[00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.400]   lost, or whatever, and watch them on your TV.
[00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:09.520]   And now they're blocking it.
[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:10.200]   I just--
[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:11.200]   [SIGHS]
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:12.520]   Oh, so now explain this to me.
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.920]   Now, this becomes then a whole new issue of net neutrality
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:17.400]   that I never understood.
[00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:17.920]   Right?
[00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:18.920]   Yeah.
[00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:21.840]   So it started with Hulu, right?
[00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.480]   Hulu, when you went on Google TV to Hulu Plus,
[00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:25.000]   I would say--
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:25.800]   I'm sorry.
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.880]   I knew you could go on TV.
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:30.200]   Even though you can use a browser on a computer,
[00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:33.160]   and I'm not sure exactly why this is different--
[00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:33.840]   Right.
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:34.640]   It's a browser.
[00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:37.640]   The computer is communicating against a manufacturer's
[00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:38.200]   device.
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:38.680]   Yeah.
[00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.680]   They're saying, well, you're-- well,
[00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.520]   and I think it was Mark Cuban who said, well,
[00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:45.440]   of course they're doing this because you're
[00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:50.440]   trying to get network television programming
[00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:53.680]   with internet economics.
[00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.920]   And you just can't-- those two don't go together.
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.040]   Well, welcome to the new world, folks.
[00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.840]   Same thing with cable vision cutting off--
[00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.640]   or Fox rather, trying to cut off cable vision customers
[00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.400]   in the fight that they're having now.
[00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:07.840]   And I was starting to write a post that didn't do--
[00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:11.440]   but you almost wonder if Fox and cable vision never
[00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.360]   came to a deal?
[00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:14.360]   Is it the end of the world?
[00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.680]   They still haven't, by the way.
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:16.400]   They still haven't--
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:17.040]   10 days.
[00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:19.880]   You still can't watch Fox 5 in New Jersey.
[00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.080]   And the Yankees didn't win, so it's lots of an issue.
[00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:24.600]   But what if they'd never reach a deal?
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.800]   Is-- would I, if I'm a cable vision customer,
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:28.320]   or a long island, and I'm happy with cable vision
[00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:33.560]   otherwise, would I cancel it because I can't get Fox?
[00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:34.840]   I don't know.
[00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:36.560]   If I'm a baseball fan, maybe.
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:39.400]   If I'm a Glee fan, well, one way or the other,
[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:41.360]   I can watch it online.
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:42.760]   They failed at trying to block--
[00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:44.320]   Glee's an interesting example because Glee
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.360]   makes itself available in every possible way.
[00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:50.600]   You can buy it, as I do on Amazon, $0.99 an episode.
[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:54.080]   You can rent it on Apple TV, as many do.
[00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:57.920]   You can watch it on Hulu Plus for free.
[00:06:57.920 --> 00:07:01.600]   Can you watch it on Fox's website as well?
[00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.720]   I don't know the odd thing is you can't watch it
[00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:06.240]   on my on-demand on Verizon files.
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:06.840]   Oh, that's right.
[00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:07.840]   It's not on-demand.
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:08.800]   Fox doesn't have a--
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.880]   And another interesting thing-- and I'm not sure if this is true,
[00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:12.160]   but it's strikes--
[00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:16.280]   I keep trying to DVR it, and I think there's a flag on it
[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:18.440]   that says, do not DVR.
[00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:22.240]   And last night, I was watching it DVRing it
[00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.120]   while I was watching it, and I couldn't fast forward
[00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.000]   through the commercials.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:26.760]   Weird.
[00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:31.040]   So I think they're telling the Comcast cable box what to do.
[00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:31.400]   So it's--
[00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:32.360]   This is so far.
[00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:33.680]   But what's confusing?
[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:37.680]   Because on the one hand, they're saying, let's put it online.
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:39.800]   And on the other hand, they're saying, but don't tear tape
[00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:41.680]   and record it.
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:43.080]   It's confusing to me.
[00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:46.240]   I wonder whether they're going to start blocking your custom.
[00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:47.240]   Go to the desktop.
[00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:48.240]   Hold on, Jeff.
[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:48.760]   Go ahead.
[00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:49.840]   Go ahead, Mitch.
[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:50.400]   OK, sir.
[00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:52.040]   I was just wondering when they're going
[00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:53.560]   to start going to the desktop to blocks.
[00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:55.480]   Maybe they'll stop blocking Firefox tomorrow
[00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:58.520]   or start blocking Dell PCs tomorrow?
[00:07:58.520 --> 00:07:59.720]   Well, it's completely arbitrary.
[00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:00.320]   Why not?
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:01.880]   I mean, you're saying, well, you're
[00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:03.480]   going to watch it on a Logitech review,
[00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:04.800]   we're going to block it.
[00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:06.400]   And by the way, for a while, people
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:08.960]   have been able to change their user agent.
[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:10.480]   That doesn't work anymore.
[00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:11.000]   What?
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.320]   There's going to be an app for Google TV any minute now
[00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:14.360]   that changes the user agent.
[00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:15.000]   No, no, no.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.440]   You can change the user agent, but they're
[00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:19.480]   looking at something else now because they still block.
[00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:24.120]   You can say, oh, I'm not Chrome on a Logitech review.
[00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:25.160]   I'm on a Google TV.
[00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:27.280]   I'm Firefox on a Mac.
[00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:28.160]   And it still blocks you.
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.760]   It's seeing something else.
[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:34.560]   By the way, these are shows that are shown on broadcast TV,
[00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:38.280]   which is free-way in economics on airwaves
[00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:41.040]   that we give these networks.
[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:46.000]   And any business today that's built on how to screw your end
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.400]   user, isn't going to work.
[00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:51.640]   At some point, somebody's going to make a great show
[00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:52.880]   for the internet.
[00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:55.080]   And they're going to go around all of this structure
[00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:57.360]   and make a fortune and not share it with a studio
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:59.800]   and not share it with a network and not share it
[00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:00.960]   with a cable company.
[00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:02.640]   And that's when the economic is going to change.
[00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:04.080]   And I think what's happening here
[00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:06.400]   is that we're going to see that, well, we
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:08.320]   don't need these channels.
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:12.400]   You know what Mark Cuban says, that the networks are handing
[00:09:12.400 --> 00:09:14.400]   a win to Netflix.
[00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:16.480]   That essentially the winner here, Netflix, which we mentioned
[00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:20.480]   last week, consumes 20% of all prime time bandwidth
[00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:25.920]   in America for its streaming TV, is the one that's
[00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:30.880]   got deals with everybody, including Google TV, Roku, Apple.
[00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:34.280]   And they're going to win because everybody else is blocked.
[00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:36.760]   But that means you won't get to watch Glee till next year
[00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:38.360]   when it comes out on DVD.
[00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:39.360]   Right.
[00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:40.360]   Right.
[00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:42.320]   Go ahead.
[00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:44.840]   So some as they keep under using SusselVester,
[00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:47.560]   then that's not really enough to go.
[00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:50.360]   I don't think she was underused this week.
[00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:51.360]   She was evil.
[00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:52.720]   In the whole thing, she--
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:53.720]   Last week maybe.
[00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:55.200]   I love the Rocky Horror.
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:55.680]   In fact--
[00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:56.680]   Oh, it was so good.
[00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:58.080]   So you know what, immediately I do,
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:00.400]   so we watch it kind of live.
[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:02.200]   And it's so funny because we're watching it live.
[00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:03.240]   And we're going, what are these?
[00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:05.560]   Oh, commercials.
[00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:06.880]   How do you get out of these?
[00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:08.240]   And then so we went, we rewound.
[00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:10.480]   This is 15 minutes into the beginning.
[00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:12.120]   So my son could watch--
[00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:13.320]   because he's never seen Rocky Horror.
[00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:14.600]   So I thought, oh, come here.
[00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:15.760]   So he's watching it.
[00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:17.560]   And then we try to fast forward through the commercials.
[00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:18.560]   And I can't.
[00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:20.880]   And go, what?
[00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:22.600]   But then then immediately after, what do I do?
[00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:24.560]   I fire up the Roku.
[00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:26.440]   And I put Rocky Horror Picture Show on
[00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:28.080]   so we can watch the real thing.
[00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:29.160]   Yep.
[00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:29.680]   Oh, cool.
[00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:32.800]   This is a great use case for internet plus--
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:33.560]   Exactly.
[00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:35.200]   --and then links to the other.
[00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:36.160]   One grows the other.
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:37.040]   It's the network.
[00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:38.800]   The other thing I saw last night, by the way,
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:40.240]   I don't know if it was on Glee or not.
[00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:41.280]   I don't know, was it?
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:44.160]   I was noting that I was watching Glee on another network
[00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:47.440]   was a killer commercial, a new version of one
[00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:49.360]   with-- what's her name, Leah?
[00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:51.000]   Who's the great singer?
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:52.080]   The Amazon.
[00:10:52.080 --> 00:10:53.440]   Yeah, thank you.
[00:10:53.440 --> 00:10:55.640]   And doing "Sound of Music," they're
[00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:57.760]   caught with the movie.
[00:10:57.760 --> 00:10:58.160]   Oh.
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:03.760]   So you see Julie Andrews, Leah doing a distributed duet.
[00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:04.640]   What was that for?
[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:05.840]   Was that for next time?
[00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:07.640]   For Dove, Dove--
[00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:08.640]   For Dove.
[00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:10.080]   --of body wash.
[00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:10.560]   Yeah.
[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:12.440]   And it was really great.
[00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:14.360]   And it's not online yet that I can find.
[00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:16.680]   There's an original version of her of Leah seeing--
[00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:18.600]   Oh, that's not--
[00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:21.760]   --from "Sound of Music," but not my favorite things.
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:22.280]   It was amazing.
[00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:26.360]   The hills are alive with the smell of Dove body wash.
[00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:28.480]   What's happened to Twig?
[00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:32.120]   Glee is corrupting the entire culture.
[00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:34.520]   Jeff has wanted to do a media show with Emily.
[00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:35.360]   Is Emily Bell?
[00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:36.200]   Play Bell.
[00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:36.920]   For a long time.
[00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:39.000]   And we're going to have to launch this just so we can move this.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.840]   Of course, you're going to say, move the Glee, talk off.
[00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:41.360]   Yeah.
[00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:45.000]   But it's very relevant, because what it's about is this move
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.440]   that this transition that we're going through-- and Google TV
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:49.240]   is a big part of this--
[00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:53.680]   from a broadcast economy to an internet economy.
[00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:54.200]   Yeah.
[00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:56.400]   Glee's did so well to promote the show online.
[00:11:56.400 --> 00:11:58.400]   And Glee's the one show that I do watch live,
[00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:00.040]   because I just love it and I want to see it.
[00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:02.600]   And Glee's the show that I want to watch the Twitter stream,
[00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:03.600]   the tag, the people--
[00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:04.600]   That's interesting.
[00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:05.760]   --what people are saying as it goes.
[00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:07.200]   That's my life's worth event.
[00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:08.040]   No.
[00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:09.200]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:11.680]   So the internet is encouraging you
[00:12:11.680 --> 00:12:14.440]   to watch it live with commercials.
[00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:15.040]   They didn't--
[00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:15.540]   Yeah.
[00:12:15.540 --> 00:12:18.560]   --they say that was why so many people watched,
[00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:20.200]   like the Grammys and the Emmys.
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:23.480]   These big event TV was being helped by Twitter.
[00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:25.720]   Yeah, because you can follow along live
[00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:28.640]   and have a conversation while you're watching.
[00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:30.320]   Yeah, Mad Men is kind of similar,
[00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:31.960]   although Mad Men's commercials are actually good.
[00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:33.880]   So I enjoy watching those.
[00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:35.840]   C-A-N-E is learning--
[00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:36.440]   A-C.
[00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:38.560]   --and C. So what's really interesting here
[00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:42.960]   is there's some people who see this as the end of the world.
[00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:45.000]   And we've got to hold on for dear life.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.480]   And we've got to block those suns of bitches at Google.
[00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:50.360]   And some people say, this is an opportunity.
[00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:51.160]   Let's use Twitter.
[00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:53.240]   Let's use the internet.
[00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:56.120]   Let's make this-- let's make it work.
[00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:59.480]   Well, if you go to the economics father,
[00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:01.560]   I don't know who produces Glee.
[00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:05.360]   It's probably Fox, but let's imagine that it's somebody else.
[00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:09.560]   And if they own the show, and if they can monetize it,
[00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:11.440]   if they can have an ad sale structure,
[00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:16.040]   it's in their interest to go around the networks and the cable
[00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:17.360]   companies pretty soon.
[00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:19.440]   Right now, it's not because you don't get the mass.
[00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:20.760]   You don't get the size.
[00:13:20.760 --> 00:13:21.680]   It's really hard to do that.
[00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:23.280]   But somebody's going to break that.
[00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:26.760]   Someone is going to get a critical mass hit.
[00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:30.320]   And they need less audience to make as much money,
[00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:32.240]   because if you're not sharing it with so many people.
[00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:34.520]   And that's going to start to break away the hegemony
[00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:37.840]   of cable and channels, I think.
[00:13:37.840 --> 00:13:38.360]   I agree.
[00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:41.200]   Yeah, but aren't there always going to be gatekeepers?
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:44.440]   And aren't we always going to see a tendency for media
[00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:46.040]   to get big?
[00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:48.880]   Just look at the way bloggers have become more--
[00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:50.680]   Yeah, but OK, let's say--
[00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:51.440]   Leo's the case of that.
[00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:56.400]   So Leo, how do you answer that just from Twit Inc?
[00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:58.240]   Are you the gatekeeper now?
[00:13:58.240 --> 00:13:59.760]   Yeah, but we build our--
[00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:02.920]   OK, here's what's different, Mitch.
[00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:05.280]   I understand, as now as a small businessman,
[00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:07.720]   once you write a business plan, it's really hard
[00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:10.920]   to change your model.
[00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:12.040]   I created a business plan that's
[00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:15.160]   based on selling advertisements to 18 million eyeballs
[00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:15.880]   every week.
[00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:17.920]   It's very hard to say, well, that's not going to work.
[00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:18.920]   Now, what do we do?
[00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:21.040]   And a lot of companies can never make that transition.
[00:14:21.040 --> 00:14:22.760]   Your business plan is your business plan,
[00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:25.240]   and your business lives and dies by it.
[00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:27.840]   Our business plan is completely internet modeled, right?
[00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:29.440]   We make more money by eyeballs.
[00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:30.360]   We want everybody to see it.
[00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:31.360]   We don't want to block it.
[00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:34.320]   In fact, we want it to be on every platform possible.
[00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:40.040]   Maybe that's because we're alternative to mainstream media,
[00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:42.240]   and so we have to compete that way.
[00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:44.200]   But I think that that's how our plan is written.
[00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:46.200]   Now, I can imagine a time, some years
[00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:48.200]   hence, where it changes again.
[00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:50.280]   And I'll be sitting here with an old business model
[00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:51.480]   that doesn't work anymore.
[00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:53.120]   And I can see how you get high bound,
[00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:54.680]   and it's very difficult to change that.
[00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:59.200]   But I don't think we'll be gatekeepers in that sense.
[00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:03.040]   Our model is around community building and growing community,
[00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:05.080]   involving community.
[00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:09.800]   In fact, where I want to go is more interactivity, more chatrooms,
[00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:13.560]   more textual stuff, more of that kind of stuff.
[00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:17.520]   And so I think in that respect, we're
[00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:20.040]   built around being open.
[00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:22.280]   Yeah, I think in any established company, though,
[00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:24.120]   you're going to have people--
[00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:25.360]   you're going to have a company that's
[00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:27.960]   thriving on an existing business model.
[00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:29.920]   And you're going to have people whose careers depend
[00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:31.400]   on that business model succeeding.
[00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:35.760]   So if somebody else comes in with a new business model,
[00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:38.880]   they can never get their foot unless you have a company
[00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:42.280]   with a really dynamic leader, like Steve Jobs,
[00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:46.160]   or going back 50 years, like, blanked on the guy's name
[00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:47.520]   from CBS.
[00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:48.360]   Edward, I'm around.
[00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:50.920]   No, sir enough?
[00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:52.320]   Yeah, David, sir enough.
[00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:54.120]   Yeah, the guy who said, you know what?
[00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:55.400]   We're in the broadcast business.
[00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:56.600]   We're not in the radio business.
[00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:57.880]   We have to pioneer television.
[00:15:57.880 --> 00:15:59.240]   Yeah, he was brilliant.
[00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:00.680]   Yeah, he was brilliant.
[00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:02.880]   But in most cases, you have big companies--
[00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:03.320]   I'm sorry.
[00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:04.480]   No, you can count the companies that
[00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:06.840]   have done that successfully on the fingers of one hand.
[00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:07.640]   Apple might have done it.
[00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:08.480]   Microsoft tried.
[00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:11.600]   And I think Microsoft, you can make it, guys, has not.
[00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:12.000]   Polaroid--
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.360]   Well, they succeeded in '95.
[00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:15.040]   Polaroid tried.
[00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:17.600]   Yeah, they succeeded in their era, their business model
[00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:18.600]   worked.
[00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:20.680]   Now, I mean, the Ray Aussie-leaving Microsoft
[00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:22.840]   is a perfect example of this.
[00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:24.200]   It's an acknowledgment that we're not
[00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:25.960]   going to make the transition and we're going to try.
[00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:27.720]   But it's a pretty clear acknowledgment.
[00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:29.240]   They're not going to make that transition
[00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:31.240]   into this new cloud-based system.
[00:16:31.240 --> 00:16:32.600]   They're a software company.
[00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:34.320]   You are the disruptor.
[00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:34.840]   That's right.
[00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:37.120]   I finally realized we got a big grant
[00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:39.040]   to open a Center for Entrepreneurial Journalism.
[00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:40.200]   As I'm working in the curriculum,
[00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:42.920]   I realized that what I have to teach is disruption.
[00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:43.440]   Yeah.
[00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:45.920]   And so you're right, Mitch, that somebody comes along
[00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:48.560]   and their instinct is to protect their model,
[00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:53.280]   but the innovation in media is going to come from LEOs.
[00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:54.240]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:54.720]   No question.
[00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:56.800]   Now, it is a good point somebody's making the chat room
[00:16:56.800 --> 00:17:01.000]   that it's not like radio-killed newspapers
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.360]   and television-killed radio.
[00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:04.560]   And I mean, these old--
[00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:08.000]   I don't think we're talking about that.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.600]   Well, can you give us a more significant change?
[00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:10.920]   I think it's a more significant change.
[00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:14.440]   Uh, you know, at some point, CBS News will die.
[00:17:14.440 --> 00:17:15.320]   Will all of it die?
[00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:16.160]   No, never does.
[00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:18.160]   But that's really beside the point.
[00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:20.560]   The point is, where is the opportunity here?
[00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:21.120]   Well, here's the example.
[00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:24.960]   I always say, Leo, that when you left a network,
[00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:26.600]   you didn't go to get a job at another network.
[00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:27.200]   You started--
[00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:28.480]   I made my own network.
[00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:29.480]   Yeah.
[00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:32.360]   Here's a good example as a record industry.
[00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:34.480]   It's completely been disintermediated.
[00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:36.760]   The way music is made and sold will not
[00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:39.400]   be the same in 10 years as it was 10 years ago.
[00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:41.120]   I mean, that's just obvious.
[00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:42.040]   Right.
[00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:46.320]   And so I think that it's going to be something new
[00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:48.720]   is going to have to emerge even in--
[00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:50.240]   Well, here's the question, though.
[00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:51.480]   Getting back to Mark Cuban.
[00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:56.800]   This stuff we do is cheap.
[00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:57.680]   The twig does is cheap.
[00:17:57.680 --> 00:17:59.960]   It has to be really, really, really cheap.
[00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:01.200]   Valuable, but cheap.
[00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:02.440]   Right.
[00:18:02.440 --> 00:18:03.840]   We couldn't do Glee.
[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:06.240]   We couldn't-- I mean, not-- the economics for Glee
[00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:07.480]   are very different.
[00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:09.040]   And so that's what Mark's saying.
[00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:11.920]   He's saying, you can't-- there's a web economic model.
[00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:13.720]   And there's a broadcast economic model.
[00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:15.840]   You can't support broadcast shows or can you
[00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:18.040]   with a web economic model.
[00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:20.160]   Well, then maybe you don't have broadcast shows.
[00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:20.920]   Well, that's a question.
[00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:24.840]   Are we going to say goodbye to blockbuster movies and big
[00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:25.360]   production?
[00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:27.000]   No, but the odds of making the blockbuster
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:27.880]   is much higher.
[00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:29.440]   The risk is much, much higher.
[00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:31.240]   That's why we have reality TV.
[00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:34.680]   Now, could you make--
[00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:37.320]   pick your reality TV show on the web?
[00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:38.680]   Sure.
[00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:39.960]   Sure, you absolutely could.
[00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:40.960]   In fact--
[00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:43.280]   the web will be better at reality TV.
[00:18:43.280 --> 00:18:44.280]   Exactly.
[00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:45.720]   Exactly.
[00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:49.000]   And so all that we're waiting for is somebody
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:50.800]   to go do it and prove it.
[00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:51.440]   And you're right, Leo.
[00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:54.680]   It's not only the cost or the production is lower,
[00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:55.960]   because it has to be.
[00:18:55.960 --> 00:18:59.720]   But also, you're sharing revenue with far fewer middlemen.
[00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:00.840]   That's true.
[00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:02.240]   That's the real key to the economics here.
[00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:02.720]   That's true.
[00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:05.440]   Is that you have your own ad sales,
[00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:08.280]   and you're sharing nothing with nobody.
[00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:11.600]   And the cost, the capital costs are lower now.
[00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:12.280]   Exactly.
[00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:14.360]   The only thing that isn't lower is personnel.
[00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:15.720]   Staff costs are not lower.
[00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:16.360]   They're higher.
[00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:18.040]   They go higher all the time.
[00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:19.120]   Right.
[00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:20.440]   But you don't need--
[00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:22.200]   What does something like the guilt--
[00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:24.200]   people in the chatroom are saying, what about the guilt?
[00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:26.560]   The guilt is a fairly high production value.
[00:19:26.560 --> 00:19:27.440]   It is.
[00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:28.480]   I don't think they may-- I don't think
[00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:30.600]   Valicia makes any money on it, though, do they?
[00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:32.440]   Well, she has that distribution deal with Microsoft.
[00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:34.640]   So I think she pays everyone.
[00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:35.480]   I guess they break you.
[00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:36.440]   She didn't start out that way.
[00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:37.320]   She wasn't paying everyone.
[00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:39.080]   Initially, I think she pays everyone now.
[00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:40.040]   I don't think she's rich.
[00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:41.760]   She won't say that she's getting rich.
[00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:43.800]   But she's supporting herself.
[00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:46.600]   And she's got the comic book, and all the other offshoot stuff.
[00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:50.240]   I also pay for HBO, so I can watch things like The Wire
[00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:53.200]   and treatment and shows like that.
[00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:54.960]   And I'd pay to watch Mad Men.
[00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:56.000]   I'd pay to watch Glee.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:56.960]   I would, too.
[00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:57.960]   So--
[00:19:57.960 --> 00:19:59.120]   But you know what we're going to have to do?
[00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:01.160]   It's going to have to be all our card.
[00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:03.760]   So there's different revenue streams there.
[00:20:03.760 --> 00:20:04.260]   Yes.
[00:20:04.260 --> 00:20:05.920]   And I supposedly am always against pay TV.
[00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:08.080]   But you're right, I would pay for those shows-- well, not
[00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:10.280]   Mad Men, but that's another story.
[00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:12.400]   So you don't like Mad Men?
[00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:13.480]   I've never gotten into it.
[00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:14.840]   What's wrong with you?
[00:20:14.840 --> 00:20:16.600]   Because when I started watching it,
[00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:17.400]   I'm going to get in trouble now.
[00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:18.560]   The chatroom's going to--
[00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:20.760]   We've got to do this show with Emily.
[00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:22.160]   I know.
[00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:24.280]   I just said at Twitter that this is twig,
[00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:27.320]   is twig into this weekend Glee.
[00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:28.000]   I love it.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.440]   That's not a bad idea.
[00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:30.080]   Wait a minute.
[00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:31.920]   Yeah, forget the same.
[00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:34.320]   Actually, when I was going to start a video company, Leo,
[00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:38.840]   I started a show that was all about this American Idol.
[00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:39.840]   American Idol the next day.
[00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:40.800]   Great idea.
[00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:41.520]   It was a great idea.
[00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:41.920]   It worked well.
[00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:44.320]   I just couldn't get the idea to come to you for ad sales.
[00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:48.360]   Oh, Mad Men.
[00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:51.120]   So it probably just seemed so blunt and obvious to me.
[00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:53.160]   So '60s cliched, but that's something
[00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:54.480]   I get in trouble, so I'll stop there.
[00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:57.560]   Mad Men is about feeling--
[00:20:57.560 --> 00:20:58.400]   it's about gestalt.
[00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:01.320]   It's about the look.
[00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:03.000]   It's not about plot.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:04.680]   Is it, Jim?
[00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:08.160]   I feel like I understand my parents a lot more watching Mad Men.
[00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:09.600]   Just culturally.
[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:11.920]   Not the bad behavior going on in the character.
[00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:13.160]   I just feel like culturally.
[00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:14.120]   Like I have a deep--
[00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:15.600]   But Jeff and I grew up in that era,
[00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:18.080]   but we're the age of the kids in that show.
[00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:19.440]   Yeah, me too.
[00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:19.920]   Yeah.
[00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:21.680]   I love the show because it's so understated.
[00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:25.040]   Like the next show is, some guy looks in another guy.
[00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:26.280]   Oh my god.
[00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:27.400]   He loves it.
[00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:29.160]   It's subtle.
[00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:30.320]   It's too subtle for Jeff.
[00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:31.880]   He wants knife fights.
[00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:32.240]   No.
[00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:33.480]   No, I think it was the opposite.
[00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:34.840]   I think it was too blunt.
[00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:38.000]   In the early shows, when they had the racism,
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.600]   it was too blunt.
[00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:42.120]   I know what you're saying.
[00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:43.560]   It's when they mention the Beatles.
[00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:45.680]   It's almost as if they go--
[00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:48.440]   the Beatles are playing Shea Stadium.
[00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:48.960]   Right.
[00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:49.960]   It's just that.
[00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:52.080]   That's the first couple of episodes we're like that.
[00:21:52.080 --> 00:21:54.480]   It was like, I'm going to smoke an unfiltered cigarette.
[00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:55.400]   Oh, look at me.
[00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:56.760]   It's a freaking before you go on.
[00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:58.240]   Oh my god, sure.
[00:21:58.240 --> 00:21:59.920]   Oh.
[00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:01.480]   They think down that back a lot.
[00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:02.120]   They have.
[00:22:02.120 --> 00:22:02.840]   It's a little more sad.
[00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:05.480]   If we start talking dance with the stars, I'm leaving.
[00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:06.480]   Yeah.
[00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:07.480]   I'm going to pull a whoopee.
[00:22:07.480 --> 00:22:10.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:12.480]   All right, we're going to change the subject.
[00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:13.680]   I'm going to-- wait, wait, wait.
[00:22:13.680 --> 00:22:14.840]   You watch dance with the stars?
[00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:15.480]   I don't.
[00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:18.120]   I only watched it when Waz was on.
[00:22:18.120 --> 00:22:18.920]   I don't watch it.
[00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:19.920]   Gina?
[00:22:19.920 --> 00:22:20.440]   I don't.
[00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:22.360]   I mean, if it's on, I might glance out of it.
[00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:22.760]   But I don't--
[00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:23.120]   I don't--
[00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:23.620]   I don't--
[00:22:23.620 --> 00:22:25.080]   Are you the only one here?
[00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:26.560]   Mitch, watch is it?
[00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:27.160]   No, I do not.
[00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:27.680]   OK.
[00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:28.200]   All right.
[00:22:28.200 --> 00:22:28.480]   All right.
[00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:29.080]   You're safe now.
[00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:30.000]   No, it's--
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.360]   But most reality television, I find kind of offensive.
[00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:36.080]   But it's kind of funny, because if I think about it,
[00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:43.920]   I've been pitching reality TV to networks since 1992.
[00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:45.680]   Oh.
[00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:46.200]   But it was--
[00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:47.320]   It was your fault.
[00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:50.440]   No, I just knew that TV was going to have to be cheap.
[00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:51.680]   An unscripted TV.
[00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:56.320]   And you know what's interesting is, I think Americans are
[00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:58.760]   getting a taste for unscripted in general, even
[00:22:58.760 --> 00:22:59.960]   in our movies.
[00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:02.880]   This movies of Judd Apatow and Will Ferrell, which
[00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:06.720]   are much of them are ad lib now, have generated, I think,
[00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:11.280]   a taste for the spontaneous and the unexpected.
[00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:13.040]   And when I see scripted comedies now,
[00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:16.120]   I feel like it's kind of flat.
[00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:18.400]   Yeah, although I really enjoy making fun of people
[00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:22.640]   mauling the English language and cliches in reality TV.
[00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:23.080]   It's just--
[00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:23.760]   So you watch it--
[00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:24.840]   You watch it's a mocks--
[00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:26.240]   to mocks Snooki or whatever.
[00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:26.960]   Yeah, sometimes.
[00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:28.400]   I mean, even just regular folks.
[00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:29.960]   Just, you know, and we do--
[00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:31.000]   I do it on the show too.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:31.600]   I'm not blaming.
[00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:33.920]   But there are times when I really miss the writers.
[00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:35.200]   It's very real.
[00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:36.200]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:36.700]   Yeah.
[00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:38.080]   Well, we'll stay on this for a second,
[00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:39.960]   because one of the items on the list
[00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:42.360]   is that Google is giving away 10,000 Google TVs
[00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:45.400]   to developers, which is the way that Google thinks, right?
[00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:45.960]   Yeah, that's wrong.
[00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:46.880]   You're going to make Google TV work.
[00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:47.440]   It's apps.
[00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:48.360]   It's about content.
[00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:48.840]   I'm sorry.
[00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:51.160]   But yeah, they should be giving away
[00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:55.240]   something to 10,000 producers of content.
[00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:57.280]   They should be giving away millions to a star.
[00:23:57.280 --> 00:23:58.280]   They should foster--
[00:23:58.280 --> 00:23:58.800]   They should start.
[00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:01.560]   They should foster online production.
[00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:01.840]   Right.
[00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:03.480]   And when they do that, then they can--
[00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:05.560]   Father knows that the networks that are now blocking them.
[00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:06.360]   I've always thought that.
[00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:09.000]   I mean, arguably, that's what YouTube does.
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:12.360]   So if you got a-- Leo, if you got a million dollars
[00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:14.680]   investment from Google to make the TV that's
[00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:17.280]   going to make Google TV work, what would it be?
[00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:18.920]   Hmm.
[00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:19.400]   I would--
[00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:20.040]   And you're making an off--
[00:24:20.040 --> 00:24:26.240]   give me a number and a Twitter-length elevator pitch.
[00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:28.280]   I would absolutely do reality.
[00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:32.160]   I would do something.
[00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:33.760]   I would probably do--
[00:24:33.760 --> 00:24:35.840]   What would I do with a million dollars?
[00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:38.880]   We've built everything around being like a buck an hour.
[00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:39.400]   So--
[00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:41.120]   But you now just said, well, you can't make some stuff.
[00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:42.120]   You can't make some stuff.
[00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:43.160]   Well, I wouldn't do believe--
[00:24:43.160 --> 00:24:43.920]   I wouldn't do believe.
[00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:45.320]   I think that-- I mean, you could spend a million--
[00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:46.880]   a million dollars isn't enough.
[00:24:46.880 --> 00:24:49.680]   I'm sure Glee's more than a million bucks an episode easily.
[00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:51.120]   Oh, yeah.
[00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:52.240]   I know most big budget--
[00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:52.840]   Mad Men.
[00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:55.600]   And most big budget dramatic shows are more than a million
[00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:56.080]   dollars.
[00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:58.840]   What would you do with comedy?
[00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:00.440]   Something that's funny.
[00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:01.120]   And by the way--
[00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:02.040]   I'd probably do the guild.
[00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:02.440]   I think the guild is--
[00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:03.360]   You want to do the guild.
[00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:05.160]   You want to do Dr. Horrible's sing-along blog?
[00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:05.680]   Yeah.
[00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:08.760]   One early attempt at bypassing the networks completely.
[00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:10.880]   I mean, Josh's show is just keep getting canceled.
[00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:13.080]   So he does Dr. Horrible, which was a huge success.
[00:25:13.080 --> 00:25:13.720]   Do it on the internet.
[00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:17.280]   It was a success both internet and mainstream.
[00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:17.780]   Yeah.
[00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:19.680]   So what would you do to make that work as a business?
[00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:21.080]   What would you do to get that to critical--
[00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:23.200]   You know what I would do is I would bring in a bunch
[00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:25.440]   of very interesting creative types
[00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:26.600]   in this building.
[00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:29.360]   I would wire this entire building for sound and video.
[00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:32.080]   And I would broadcast a stream with nine or 10
[00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:35.480]   individual streams that the viewer could--
[00:25:35.480 --> 00:25:37.600]   it's almost deconstructing television.
[00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:39.600]   In fact, it is deconstructing television.
[00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:40.880]   It's going completely backwards.
[00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:43.520]   The viewer could switch from any feed they want.
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:45.160]   And see where the heat is, yeah?
[00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:46.480]   See what's going on.
[00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:48.400]   There'd be content involved, because all the people
[00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:50.720]   would be in the building working on content of some kind.
[00:25:50.720 --> 00:25:56.520]   Maybe music, maybe not necessarily tech news, the kind
[00:25:56.520 --> 00:25:58.240]   of stuff we do.
[00:25:58.240 --> 00:25:59.560]   But I think that the--
[00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:01.560]   it would satisfy the voyeuristic impulses,
[00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:05.920]   which obviously powers reality TV.
[00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:07.280]   But I think people want content.
[00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:10.960]   And this is why I think reality TV is kind of ultimately hollow,
[00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:14.480]   is that people still want to learn something or come away
[00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:15.560]   with something.
[00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:17.480]   And reality TV is just--
[00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:19.600]   it's very surface, right?
[00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:20.600]   So--
[00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:21.960]   Gene is absolutely right.
[00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:23.920]   It's the original "Appeal of Game" shows,
[00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:27.680]   which you could make fun of your fellow man hidden.
[00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:28.840]   I can't believe they didn't answer.
[00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:29.960]   No, that was, right?
[00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:33.440]   And that's why Murf Griffin designed "Wheel of Fortune"
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:34.760]   intentionally.
[00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:38.040]   So the game design was done in such a way
[00:26:38.040 --> 00:26:42.720]   so that you knew the puzzle before it was announced,
[00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:44.880]   and because the contestants knew it, but you don't realize that.
[00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:46.920]   They know it because they're trying to prolong it
[00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:48.080]   to make more money.
[00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:50.440]   So if they've solved the puzzle but they keep playing,
[00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:52.240]   you're sitting there going, I'm smarter than them
[00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:54.120]   because I've solved it already.
[00:26:54.120 --> 00:27:02.120]   It was this brilliant insight that he had into our low behavior.
[00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:03.440]   We live in public.
[00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:04.440]   That's right.
[00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:06.480]   This is what Josh-- what's his name?
[00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:07.640]   Did Harris did--
[00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:09.800]   Josh Harris, I interviewed him for the book.
[00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:11.640]   He did that 10 years ago.
[00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:12.120]   Yeah.
[00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:14.160]   Yeah, I mean, it's fascinating because it's kind of devolved.
[00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:17.680]   But he argues that we are having kind of a shift in our DNA
[00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:20.160]   into truly living in public and changing the way we operate
[00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:20.880]   as a society.
[00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:21.240]   I agree.
[00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:22.680]   Well, you say that, don't you?
[00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:23.320]   Yeah.
[00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:23.760]   Yeah.
[00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:27.120]   Your book "Public Parts," I'm sure, is very much about that.
[00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:29.800]   What Gutenberg did to the world now you're going to do.
[00:27:29.800 --> 00:27:31.680]   You're the new Gutenberg, Leo.
[00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:33.960]   Boy, I would love it if we're actually that important.
[00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:36.520]   I somehow don't think it is.
[00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:38.360]   And on that note, let's take a break for a commercial.
[00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:39.320]   We're going to come back lots.
[00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:40.640]   There's actually a lot more Google News.
[00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:42.360]   Eric Schmidt getting creepier by the moment.
[00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:45.800]   We've got a montage of Eric's creepy moments I'm
[00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:49.960]   going to play for you and a lot more still to come.
[00:27:49.960 --> 00:27:52.000]   Gina Trapani is here, Jeff Jarvis.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.640]   And a newbie joining us is wondering,
[00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:56.120]   what the hell he's doing here right now.
[00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:57.840]   Bitch Wagner, thank you for being here.
[00:27:57.840 --> 00:27:58.400]   I'm afraid.
[00:27:58.400 --> 00:27:59.520]   Oh, be afraid.
[00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:00.520]   It's crazy.
[00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:01.280]   It's insane.
[00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:02.280]   It's all the creepy.
[00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:03.760]   It's all the creepy in there.
[00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:05.600]   Yeah, really.
[00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:07.080]   He's so creepy.
[00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:08.520]   I do want to talk about our friends
[00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:12.800]   at Citrix who do a great product called Go To Meeting.
[00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:17.000]   If you do business travel, you don't have to.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.200]   If you are spending a lot of time on conference calls,
[00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:22.040]   you can make them better with a simple little program,
[00:28:22.040 --> 00:28:25.360]   very inexpensive called Go To Meeting.
[00:28:25.360 --> 00:28:27.240]   In fact, you can try it free for 30 days.
[00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:29.560]   So you don't have to believe me when I tell you this
[00:28:29.560 --> 00:28:31.480]   is going to transform your business.
[00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:32.480]   It has ours.
[00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:34.560]   We use it all the time.
[00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:36.240]   Go to meeting.com/twig.
[00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:37.360]   You can sign up for 30 days.
[00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:39.000]   It's great for--
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.720]   well, the obvious, the presentations, sales presentations,
[00:28:41.720 --> 00:28:42.600]   you've got your PowerPoint.
[00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:43.880]   You've got a client on the other end.
[00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:46.920]   And by the way, people make clients jump through hoops
[00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:48.400]   to see their sales presentations.
[00:28:48.400 --> 00:28:49.440]   I never understood that.
[00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:51.440]   Go To Meeting is so easy.
[00:28:51.440 --> 00:28:52.800]   You send them an invitation.
[00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:54.840]   Go To Meeting integrates without look.
[00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:56.360]   You just send an invitation.
[00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:58.000]   It's got a link in it.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:28:59.760]   3 o'clock on, I got a meeting with Leo.
[00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:00.960]   They click the link.
[00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:02.440]   The software installs in 30 seconds.
[00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:04.440]   They don't need to really-- it's very transparent to them.
[00:29:04.440 --> 00:29:06.640]   And suddenly you say, hey, how you doing?
[00:29:06.640 --> 00:29:08.200]   Here's our PowerPoint presentation.
[00:29:08.200 --> 00:29:09.480]   This is what we could do for you.
[00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:10.400]   It's very easy for them.
[00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:12.720]   It's actually kind of fun for them and engaging.
[00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:16.160]   It's also great for product reviews, demos.
[00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:18.320]   I've used it to rehearse speeches with other people.
[00:29:18.320 --> 00:29:20.800]   We're going to do a two-person speech at a conference.
[00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:22.800]   We rehearse over go to meeting.
[00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:25.480]   That's great for training.
[00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:29.760]   It's just fast, easy to use, 128-bit SSL, completely secure,
[00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:31.640]   and free for 30 days right now.
[00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:35.800]   By the way, they include in the price, which I think is $49 a month.
[00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:37.560]   It's so a reason we have three or four accounts,
[00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:40.080]   because we often have multiple meetings going on.
[00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:43.280]   It includes phone and voiceover IP teleconferencing
[00:29:43.280 --> 00:29:44.680]   for free in that.
[00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:47.600]   Go to meeting.com/twig.
[00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:48.320]   Try it today.
[00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:51.640]   It really will transform the way you do business.
[00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:54.680]   All right, let me see if I can find.
[00:29:54.680 --> 00:30:00.240]   Why is Eric-- what was the thing Eric Schmidt just said yesterday?
[00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:03.160]   He said, if you don't want us to be watching you move--
[00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:04.360]   What was he saying?
[00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:06.120]   He said he don't want your home to be at the--
[00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:08.080]   I don't want to be the fender of Eric Schmidt.
[00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:09.200]   Well, it's creepy.
[00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:10.040]   But what?
[00:30:10.040 --> 00:30:11.520]   Shut him up.
[00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:12.960]   Why would he do it again?
[00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:15.800]   He didn't mean-- I think he didn't mean move houses.
[00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:18.680]   He meant-- if you see this ridiculous car coming your way
[00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:22.520]   with this big honking huge thing on top, turn around.
[00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:23.640]   I think that's what he meant.
[00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:24.760]   He said it comes once.
[00:30:24.760 --> 00:30:26.400]   It comes once.
[00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:27.760]   So what I'm going to do is to start it for--
[00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:30.000]   It takes one photo at a moment in time,
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:31.440]   and you just can leave, right?
[00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:33.160]   But it sounded so weird.
[00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:36.440]   Like, why does he come out with this stuff?
[00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:38.240]   But I interviewed him for the book.
[00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:40.440]   He called it "Death by Twitter."
[00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:42.800]   Oh, because it's the short sound bites.
[00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:45.120]   Well, one line, and then it gets spread all over.
[00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:47.640]   The line-- he's now confirmed that when he said we should
[00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:50.160]   all change our names at age 21, he was joking.
[00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:51.160]   I've sat in audiences.
[00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:52.200]   People laughed.
[00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:54.240]   He got over interpreted.
[00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:54.920]   Yeah.
[00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:57.200]   I was joking.
[00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:58.720]   Somebody needs to start a Twitter account.
[00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:00.720]   Bleep Eric Schmidt says.
[00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:03.320]   Yeah, that's a good idea.
[00:31:03.320 --> 00:31:06.400]   OK, so gawker-- so should I start at the beginning of this?
[00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:07.400]   Yeah, I'll start at the beginning.
[00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:08.400]   Yeah, it's pretty short.
[00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:13.560]   Gawker put together a compilation of clips of Eric Schmidt's
[00:31:13.560 --> 00:31:15.160]   greatest moments.
[00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:16.240]   Just watch.
[00:31:16.240 --> 00:31:18.520]   Google can do street views.
[00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:20.360]   You can see where I live.
[00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:21.200]   Street view.
[00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:22.560]   We drive exactly once.
[00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:23.960]   So you can just move, right?
[00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:26.600]   If you have something that you don't want anyone to know,
[00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:28.560]   maybe you shouldn't be doing it in the first place.
[00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:30.040]   Just remember when you post something
[00:31:30.040 --> 00:31:31.800]   that the computers remember forever.
[00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:33.240]   We know where you are.
[00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:34.840]   We know where you've been.
[00:31:34.840 --> 00:31:37.680]   We can more or less know what you're thinking about.
[00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:38.400]   I'm sorry.
[00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:41.040]   I hate to say this, but that really creeps me out.
[00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:45.840]   You famously said that someday, young people,
[00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:49.120]   instead of having privacy, that one day they'll just
[00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:53.320]   erase their histories and change their names.
[00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:54.400]   It was a joke.
[00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:56.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:59.560]   It just wasn't very good.
[00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:01.200]   So you can just move, right?
[00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:01.760]   I can move.
[00:32:01.760 --> 00:32:02.640]   Yes, or I'll turn it off.
[00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:03.560]   That's a lot of trouble.
[00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:04.040]   I know.
[00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:05.240]   Oh, dear Eric.
[00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:06.760]   Do street views.
[00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:08.840]   You can see where I live.
[00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:11.840]   So does he know?
[00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:15.440]   Yeah, I mean, I sat with him across the table,
[00:32:15.440 --> 00:32:17.680]   and yeah, he tries to joke.
[00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:20.920]   He just says that it's misinterpreted,
[00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:22.840]   or he comes out of his mouth and he knows it.
[00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:24.680]   How long before the board starts saying,
[00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:26.640]   Eric, you can't go in public anymore?
[00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:28.160]   Who's going to go with it?
[00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:29.120]   Barry and Sergey?
[00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:30.160]   They're going to be worse.
[00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:31.160]   Are they?
[00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:32.960]   Yeah, I think so, because-- oh, yeah.
[00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:33.520]   Oh, yeah.
[00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:34.680]   But at least with Larry and Sergey,
[00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:35.640]   they don't look like businessmen.
[00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:37.400]   They look like nerds, and some people just say, oh, they're--
[00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:38.920]   Oh, you have to be more scary to people then.
[00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:40.440]   They're going to think, oh, my god,
[00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:42.120]   these geeks are really taking over the world.
[00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:44.040]   We're going to hear big brother crap, all that stuff.
[00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:46.080]   No, I think that somebody said yesterday,
[00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:50.560]   Eric has at least taken the heat for the geek philosophy
[00:32:50.560 --> 00:32:51.280]   of Google.
[00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:55.840]   John Pachkowski is coined a new term, Schmittstorm.
[00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:58.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:00.280]   And Schmitt, my CEO says.
[00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:01.480]   Yeah, there you go.
[00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:02.000]   All right.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.680]   Now we've got a title.
[00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:05.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:06.720]   I think that was sign up for that.
[00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:07.480]   I'm talking to you today.
[00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:08.480]   So it's a good question.
[00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:09.680]   That's what's checking us today.
[00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:10.720]   Thank you, Tom Merritt.
[00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:13.680]   Schmitt, my CEO says.
[00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:16.080]   You know, I mean, I think that you're right, Jeff,
[00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:17.400]   that he did mean that you can just
[00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:19.400]   step out of the way of the Google Street View car
[00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:20.480]   if you see it.
[00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:23.120]   But the interviewer said, you know where I live.
[00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:25.400]   And then he said, well, you could just move.
[00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:27.440]   So I mean, it kind of makes sense
[00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:30.280]   that people kind of misinterpreted it.
[00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:34.800]   And the apology that Google issued was--
[00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:37.000]   we didn't mean that you could just move houses.
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:38.720]   If you want your home, take an off-street view,
[00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:40.520]   just let us know, and we'll do so.
[00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:42.520]   So I mean, that sort of an admission
[00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:44.640]   that the understanding was understandable.
[00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:45.160]   Sorry.
[00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:46.040]   Is that your number?
[00:33:46.040 --> 00:33:47.200]   Jeff, don't give away your number.
[00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:47.720]   No, I didn't.
[00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:49.080]   It was-- well, I could have been.
[00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:51.360]   But 244,000 people have asked Google
[00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:54.080]   to pixelate their homes.
[00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:56.480]   Or as they say in Germany, they exercise their--
[00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:57.800]   Pixel-Oomsrecht.
[00:33:57.800 --> 00:33:59.080]   Pixel-Oomsrecht?
[00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:00.080]   Do we have--
[00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:01.080]   That sounds scary.
[00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:02.320]   No, anything in Germany's--
[00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:03.160]   Do we have pixel--
[00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:04.720]   Or like a kind of sauce in Germany.
[00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:07.200]   Do we have pixel-Oomsrecht here in the United States?
[00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:07.720]   Hey.
[00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:08.080]   Hey, hey.
[00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:09.800]   What we do here is we get out in front of the camera
[00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:10.400]   and want to be--
[00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:10.880]   Monam.
[00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:12.120]   Do things on it to be on camera.
[00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:12.600]   Monam.
[00:34:12.600 --> 00:34:15.200]   Yeah, we want to be on Street View.
[00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:17.040]   Well, isn't Elmer in Italy, don't they?
[00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:19.000]   Doesn't Google need to publish the route of the street
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:20.160]   from car beforehand?
[00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:21.160]   So it kind of gets people--
[00:34:21.160 --> 00:34:22.320]   That's funny thing, Gina, was they also--
[00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:26.440]   Italy decreed that they had to clearly label the car.
[00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:27.720]   Like it can hide.
[00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:30.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:32.360]   But I want to see all the nutty Italians
[00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:34.560]   who are going to come out dressed up in costume
[00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:36.000]   and do all kinds of crazy stuff.
[00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:38.360]   You'll think it's a continuous party over there.
[00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:40.560]   I think that's completely appropriate and probably exactly
[00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:41.560]   what Google should do everywhere.
[00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:44.160]   Our Street View car is coming to your town.
[00:34:44.160 --> 00:34:45.360]   Watch for it and wave.
[00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:46.360]   I don't know.
[00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:47.280]   Or hide or move.
[00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:48.800]   Like opt in or opt out.
[00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:50.560]   I mean, you get a notification.
[00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:52.360]   I mean, really, Eric, if Eric's saying move,
[00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:53.840]   you better give us some advanced warning,
[00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:57.040]   because I mean, car you'll sneak up on you.
[00:34:57.040 --> 00:34:58.040]   Yep.
[00:34:58.040 --> 00:35:02.440]   I just got this-- sorry, but Twitter, somebody just sent us--
[00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:04.960]   just started a brand new account, Schmidt Eric says.
[00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:07.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:08.680]   OK.
[00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:10.280]   We want to see stuff on there.
[00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:12.840]   Now ironically, while Eric is saying on this creepy stuff,
[00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:16.120]   people like the Federal Trade Commission announced today
[00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:17.240]   that it's going to cease--
[00:35:17.240 --> 00:35:17.960]   Yeah, just now.
[00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:20.880]   It's going to cease its inquiry into Google's collection
[00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:25.760]   of data on Open Wi-Fi access points.
[00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:27.920]   Google said on its website that it was creating a stronger
[00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:30.240]   privacy control, Alan Eustace, senior vice president
[00:35:30.240 --> 00:35:34.040]   for engineering and research, wrote an apology.
[00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:37.520]   In a letter issued on Monday, the director of the Bureau
[00:35:37.520 --> 00:35:41.560]   of Consumer Protection cited the steps the company had taken
[00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:44.200]   in response to concerns that it collected payload data.
[00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:48.440]   And the FTC says, we don't think they did anything wrong.
[00:35:48.440 --> 00:35:50.000]   We don't think there's a problem.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:51.240]   We're dropping the investigation.
[00:35:51.240 --> 00:35:53.840]   So Britain did the same thing a few months ago.
[00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:54.720]   That's good news.
[00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:57.080]   Others in Germany and Canada are still screaming bloody.
[00:35:57.080 --> 00:36:00.520]   Well, actually Canada dropped Facebook.
[00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:03.600]   But Germany and France and places are still screaming bloody
[00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:05.840]   murder.
[00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:07.280]   Google screwed up.
[00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:08.520]   They hurt themselves terribly.
[00:36:08.520 --> 00:36:10.920]   They hurt their defenders like me.
[00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:12.080]   And I'm pissed.
[00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:18.880]   But there was no business value to what they stupidly gathered.
[00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:19.840]   None.
[00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:21.560]   Although they admitted that some of the--
[00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:25.520]   in the panel data, there were some email URLs and passwords.
[00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:27.640]   That was kind of at the end of their apology posts.
[00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:28.160]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:28.880]   Let me look at that.
[00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:29.560]   I didn't see that.
[00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:30.640]   Yeah, I was in the data.
[00:36:30.640 --> 00:36:33.160]   You know, we actually never went through the data.
[00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:35.200]   But all the regulatory agencies did.
[00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:37.600]   And they found that we had picked up passwords
[00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:40.920]   and usernames and passwords for email, that kind of thing.
[00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:42.720]   Well, you would if they're being sent in the clear.
[00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:43.240]   You know, we--
[00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:44.240]   They're being sent in the clear.
[00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:46.280]   And we should talk about fire sheep, actually.
[00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:48.760]   Did you watch the fire sheep show we just did with security
[00:36:48.760 --> 00:36:49.120]   now?
[00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:51.480]   Very interesting.
[00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:52.320]   You did a whole show.
[00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:53.240]   OK, that's what I'm going to do.
[00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:55.000]   I'm going to watch the show because I'm sure that was really--
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:56.640]   So this is a Firefox plugin.
[00:36:56.640 --> 00:36:58.320]   Not an approved Firefox plugin.
[00:36:58.320 --> 00:37:01.000]   But anybody can install it on Windows or Mac,
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:02.360]   on their Firefox.
[00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:04.480]   Then you go to a coffee shop or anywhere
[00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:05.960]   with an open access point.
[00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:07.520]   It opens a sidebar.
[00:37:07.520 --> 00:37:12.760]   It lists all the people by name and with a picture
[00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:14.520]   who are on this open access point.
[00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:17.200]   And what accounts they have open right now--
[00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:20.840]   Facebook, Twitter, Flickr.
[00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:22.480]   And you can click on those accounts.
[00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:26.560]   And due to the way that password authentication works--
[00:37:26.560 --> 00:37:27.760]   I mean, in a thumbnail-- if you really
[00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:29.120]   want to know the technical details,
[00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:30.120]   you should probably listen to the show.
[00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:33.320]   But in a thumbnail, when you log into Facebook,
[00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:36.400]   Facebook returns you a token, a cookie,
[00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:37.840]   which is then stored on your system.
[00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:41.600]   That's why you don't have to log into Facebook every page.
[00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:43.760]   It says, oh, no, we know.
[00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:45.160]   We're in a session with you.
[00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:48.520]   And so this cookie is retrieved at each page on Facebook.
[00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:50.240]   And they say, yeah, yeah, it's him.
[00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:52.680]   Well, this cookie is passed in the clear.
[00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:55.880]   So this program, Firesheet, not only sees you,
[00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:58.960]   but catches the cookie and then says, I'm him.
[00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:02.440]   Let's continue that session that I opened with my password
[00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:05.240]   a minute ago so they can see your Twitter--
[00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:06.600]   you can Twitter for you.
[00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:08.720]   They can read your Facebook stuff, post stuff there,
[00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:09.880]   change stuff there.
[00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:10.880]   Yeah.
[00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:12.320]   It's a lot of control.
[00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:14.560]   This is an exploit that web developers kind of know
[00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:15.640]   about for a long time.
[00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:18.280]   This is the reason why Gmail went to complete HTTPS.
[00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:21.360]   So even the cookie information is sent over SSL.
[00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:25.760]   And Firesheet just illuminates the problem
[00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:28.360]   that's been kind of around for a long time.
[00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:30.400]   And I saw somebody say, hey, if you
[00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:32.600]   can do this easily on an open Wi-Fi spot,
[00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:36.160]   Google could have collected this cookie, this session data,
[00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:38.440]   these cookies in their Street View cards as well.
[00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:38.960]   Sure.
[00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:41.320]   Which solution does it--
[00:38:41.320 --> 00:38:43.040]   is it HTTPS?
[00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:43.880]   That's one solution.
[00:38:43.880 --> 00:38:45.320]   The other solution that-- and anybody
[00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:47.280]   who's listening who has an open access spot,
[00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:50.400]   maybe you run a coffee shop or a bar or a restaurant
[00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:52.080]   or here at the TwitCottage.
[00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:53.640]   It's very-- the solution is very simple.
[00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:56.040]   Turn on WPA, which is the encryption
[00:38:56.040 --> 00:38:57.800]   that we recommend for closed access spots.
[00:38:57.800 --> 00:38:59.440]   No, make it a closed access spot.
[00:38:59.440 --> 00:39:01.720]   But you can give everybody the password.
[00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:05.200]   Steve said Starbucks should just put WPA on all its open access
[00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:09.960]   points and post right above the password as Starbucks.
[00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:14.400]   And by virtue of turning on WPA, you make each session--
[00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:15.000]   Encrypted.
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:15.720]   --in encrypted.
[00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:18.640]   Even though you're on the same network with the bad guy,
[00:39:18.640 --> 00:39:21.440]   he can't see those cookies anymore.
[00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:23.080]   It's a simple fix, but you know what?
[00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:24.120]   It's not going to happen.
[00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:26.760]   And now, over a quarter of a million people
[00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:28.840]   have downloaded-- in the last two days,
[00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:30.800]   have downloaded FireSheep, so--
[00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:33.680]   Right, the major players have to change the way
[00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:34.800]   that they have to change--
[00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:35.800]   Everybody has to turn it off.
[00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:37.120]   --that they have to accept the information right
[00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:38.800]   over HTTPS, the way that you know that.
[00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:39.800]   Is it the browser, Gina?
[00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:40.560]   Or is that the--
[00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:42.000]   No, the service has to do it.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:43.760]   So Facebook has to say we're going
[00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:46.960]   to transmit cookie information over HTTPS, Flickr, Twitter,
[00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:47.800]   all the major players.
[00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:48.840]   So this is good.
[00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:51.160]   I mean, it's bad, but it's good.
[00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:54.080]   Because of the fact that this extension got so popular,
[00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:56.880]   I think the big players are going to listen and change.
[00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:58.280]   Steve was jumping up and down.
[00:39:58.280 --> 00:40:00.480]   I said, Steve, you're supposed to be protecting our security.
[00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:01.280]   What the hell?
[00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:04.360]   He said, no, but this is good because now everybody can do it,
[00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:05.840]   so you've really got to fix it.
[00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:07.640]   Is there a cost to--
[00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:09.880]   Is there a transactional cost here in terms of bandwidth
[00:40:09.880 --> 00:40:10.240]   or anything?
[00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:11.440]   No, insignificant.
[00:40:11.440 --> 00:40:12.440]   It's insignificant, yeah.
[00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:17.400]   Modern HTTPS does not bog anything down.
[00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:19.560]   In fact, and we've been talking about this on security
[00:40:19.560 --> 00:40:23.280]   now for a long time, you could really have all sites be HTTPS.
[00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:24.360]   They probably should be.
[00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:27.000]   But certainly anywhere there's a log in and some privacy.
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.200]   So Amazon too, they're catching stuff?
[00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:30.720]   No, because it's HTTPS.
[00:40:30.720 --> 00:40:32.200]   It is for every page.
[00:40:32.200 --> 00:40:33.440]   Yeah, I believe so.
[00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:34.080]   Am I right, Gina?
[00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:34.600]   I don't know.
[00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:35.160]   I believe so.
[00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:36.160]   I'm checking right now.
[00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:37.160]   I'm checking right now.
[00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:41.120]   If you go to GitHub, this guy's on code butler,
[00:40:41.120 --> 00:40:44.440]   github.com/codebutler.
[00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:46.520]   He announces that a security event--
[00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:48.640]   I think in your neck of the woods.
[00:40:48.640 --> 00:40:49.600]   Torcon, wasn't it?
[00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:50.600]   Yeah.
[00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:52.440]   And--
[00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:52.960]   Whew.
[00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:53.760]   You're right.
[00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:55.760]   As soon as I go to my account on Amazon--
[00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:58.200]   It stays as secure, yeah.
[00:40:58.200 --> 00:40:59.000]   Everybody could do that.
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:00.120]   There's no reason why not.
[00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:02.280]   I mean, everybody should do that, really.
[00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:04.800]   And there was a time when HTTPS cost a little more.
[00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:07.680]   And the configurations may be a little more expensive.
[00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:08.440]   There's a very high name--
[00:41:08.440 --> 00:41:09.520]   You have to buy a certificate.
[00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:09.920]   That's my name.
[00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:11.040]   Yeah, you have to get a certificate.
[00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:12.320]   There's authentication that goes on.
[00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:14.600]   So it's a little more of a pain in the ass for the players
[00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:15.800]   to do a little bit more.
[00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:17.320]   These days, though, it's not that.
[00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:19.360]   And it should be the standard.
[00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:23.240]   And Google did it with Gmail and a few other things.
[00:41:23.240 --> 00:41:26.320]   You can even encrypt your searches as well.
[00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:27.080]   That's right.
[00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:27.920]   That's right.
[00:41:27.920 --> 00:41:29.640]   Yeah.
[00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:32.160]   They don't mention that they can do this to Google
[00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:36.040]   anywhere in the blog post, Eric's blog post.
[00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:37.360]   It's fascinating.
[00:41:40.320 --> 00:41:41.320]   Moving along.
[00:41:41.320 --> 00:41:43.440]   There's quite a lot of other things to talk about.
[00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:46.720]   It looks like Hulu Plus is going to go half price, 4.95.
[00:41:46.720 --> 00:41:49.080]   Maybe that's a response to--
[00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:49.720]   I don't know what.
[00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:51.000]   Why do you block Google TV?
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:53.440]   But then only-- I mean--
[00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:56.800]   I can only watch it on my iPad and my computer.
[00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:57.920]   I'm paying you $5.
[00:41:57.920 --> 00:41:59.520]   I'm getting commercials.
[00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:01.800]   And I still can't watch it on my big screen.
[00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:03.280]   I think what's going on here is they just
[00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:07.200]   see an opportunity to hit up Google for a toll.
[00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:08.800]   Oh.
[00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:09.640]   They want Google.
[00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:12.200]   We want-- it's like those Belgian publishers a while ago
[00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:13.560]   that blocked Google news.
[00:42:13.560 --> 00:42:14.960]   Right, Mitch.
[00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:17.240]   They want the traffic from Google,
[00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:19.760]   but they want Google to pay for it, too.
[00:42:19.760 --> 00:42:21.880]   As Woody Allen would say, they want the eggs.
[00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:22.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:24.840]   Yeah.
[00:42:24.840 --> 00:42:27.520]   I'm not a joke reviews on this show before.
[00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:28.120]   It's a classic.
[00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:31.160]   And so part of this is that a major owner of Hulu
[00:42:31.160 --> 00:42:31.840]   is News Corp.
[00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:36.240]   And News Corp makes Google the enemy whenever possible.
[00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:38.480]   Yeah.
[00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:39.240]   Interesting.
[00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:41.040]   Yeah.
[00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:43.320]   Let's talk about search.
[00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:46.840]   Google set an internet traffic record this week.
[00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:52.240]   They're biggest-- according-- now, this
[00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:54.840]   is from Arbor Networks, which monitors traffic.
[00:42:54.840 --> 00:42:58.520]   They're biggest internet traffic of all times.
[00:42:58.520 --> 00:43:01.240]   Google now represents an average 6.4%
[00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:04.520]   of all internet traffic worldwide.
[00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:09.320]   The number grows even larger as much as 8% to 12%
[00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:11.280]   if you include estimates of traffic
[00:43:11.280 --> 00:43:16.080]   offloaded by Google Global Cash deployments.
[00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:18.480]   I wonder what percentage of that is YouTube?
[00:43:18.480 --> 00:43:19.680]   Oh, that's an interesting question.
[00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:20.680]   Yeah.
[00:43:20.680 --> 00:43:21.280]   Good point.
[00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:25.560]   When you see that Netflix is using 20% of peak internet access,
[00:43:25.560 --> 00:43:28.320]   you've got to figure YouTube's got to be a big chunk in there.
[00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:30.080]   That would be a big chunk of that, right?
[00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:32.520]   Arbor says, well, it's not news that Google is big.
[00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:36.240]   What is amazing is how much bigger Google continues
[00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:36.600]   to get.
[00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:39.000]   A quick analysis of the data also shows
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:43.040]   that Google now has direct peering with more than 70%
[00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:44.920]   of all providers around the world.
[00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:47.280]   That's 5% to 10% up from last year.
[00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:49.600]   And he says, in fact, the only remaining major group
[00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:52.920]   of internet service providers without direct Google peering
[00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:58.160]   are the big tier ones in the national telecom companies.
[00:43:58.160 --> 00:44:02.080]   People like, I guess, Level 3 and NT Dokomo, people like that.
[00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:04.640]   Peering means that you have a direct connect.
[00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:08.200]   So if your Comcast, for instance, is your ISP,
[00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:09.720]   when you go to Google on Comcast,
[00:44:09.720 --> 00:44:11.720]   it doesn't go over the internet backbones.
[00:44:11.720 --> 00:44:15.080]   There's a wire that comes out of the Google office
[00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:18.320]   and goes into the Comcast office's direct connect.
[00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:22.240]   And that saves everybody money and saves the backbone traffic.
[00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:24.240]   But that's a lot of traffic.
[00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:26.760]   I imagine that when they lost something like Google Instant,
[00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:30.680]   which pushes down 20 sets of search results in one search.
[00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:31.880]   There you go.
[00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:34.400]   I don't see a big spike on this chart here right around
[00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:37.960]   that when you went to the launch, which was like, what, September?
[00:44:37.960 --> 00:44:39.360]   That's interesting.
[00:44:39.360 --> 00:44:42.000]   So it went up September on 9.
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:42.920]   That's pretty light.
[00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:45.480]   I mean, it's like text.
[00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:46.560]   Yeah, I mean, it's text.
[00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:47.080]   Right?
[00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:48.480]   It's good to see.
[00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:51.600]   I mean, the biggest peak is right around September.
[00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:54.480]   I mean, I think that there is something to be said for that.
[00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:56.560]   He says-- What's that little trough there, I wonder?
[00:44:56.560 --> 00:44:57.080]   Yeah, I know.
[00:44:57.080 --> 00:44:59.000]   It went down a little bit in June and January.
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   That was the air.
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:01.520]   That's the Eric Schmidt trough.
[00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:03.200]   That's what people say.
[00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:04.200]   Oh, my God.
[00:45:04.200 --> 00:45:05.040]   That's the creepy line.
[00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:06.040]   That's the creepy line.
[00:45:06.040 --> 00:45:08.280]   That's what he was out there peering in people's windows.
[00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:10.840]   Yeah, he fell below the creepy line.
[00:45:10.840 --> 00:45:13.080]   And it looks like that's January of--
[00:45:13.080 --> 00:45:16.040]   Yeah, you know, it really is a bad one.
[00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:17.200]   When Google--
[00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:19.200]   when Eric said all that stuff.
[00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:22.480]   The irony, by the way, of him using the word creepy
[00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:24.920]   is that what I talked to him, he was really
[00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:26.160]   pissed about the Times Square.
[00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:27.000]   Oh, interesting.
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:28.000]   Part two.
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:28.920]   OK.
[00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:30.400]   Which portrays him as--
[00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:31.480]   As creepy.
[00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:33.840]   Yeah.
[00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:37.200]   If Google were an internet service provider, according to--
[00:45:37.200 --> 00:45:39.960]   this is Craig Labowitz writing at Arbor Networks,
[00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:41.960]   if Google were an internet service provider,
[00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:47.760]   it would rank as the second largest carrier on the planet.
[00:45:47.760 --> 00:45:49.360]   The only global tier one provider that
[00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:53.320]   carries more traffic than Google,
[00:45:53.320 --> 00:45:56.320]   only one global tier one provider carries more traffic
[00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:57.320]   than Google.
[00:45:57.320 --> 00:45:58.360]   And he doesn't say who it is.
[00:45:58.360 --> 00:46:00.280]   I'm curious.
[00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:03.680]   That's how big Google is.
[00:46:03.680 --> 00:46:04.480]   It's pretty impressive.
[00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:05.000]   Amazing.
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:05.920]   Yep.
[00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:09.760]   So is this how does this fit in their gigabit--
[00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:13.200]   Well, you can see why they want everybody to have more bandwidth.
[00:46:13.200 --> 00:46:15.680]   And of course, the pairing arrangements
[00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:18.920]   get the internet service providers off their back, right?
[00:46:18.920 --> 00:46:19.520]   Right.
[00:46:19.520 --> 00:46:20.680]   Well, that's also what we did.
[00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:24.280]   But at home started, made a rest in peace.
[00:46:24.280 --> 00:46:26.560]   Long ago, their original deal was
[00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:28.240]   that they were going to peer and then charge you
[00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:29.840]   for the privilege of peerings.
[00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:30.840]   Oh, really?
[00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:31.320]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:46:31.320 --> 00:46:32.480]   I sat in meetings with them.
[00:46:32.480 --> 00:46:37.840]   So they were going to say to NBC, this is neutrality.
[00:46:37.840 --> 00:46:42.400]   If you want your content to go at high speed to your users,
[00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:44.520]   you may peer-- and you're going to pay us for it.
[00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:46.480]   This was the original cable modems from--
[00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:49.040]   it was from Comcast, right at home.
[00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:49.520]   No.
[00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:54.720]   It was a company that Comcast used for its--
[00:46:54.720 --> 00:46:57.400]   Yeah, at home was supposed to be this kind of--
[00:46:57.400 --> 00:46:58.880]   I can't even know what you'd call it now.
[00:46:58.880 --> 00:47:03.640]   It wasn't a portal, but it was going to be this--
[00:47:03.640 --> 00:47:04.720]   Well, hers started it.
[00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:05.040]   I remember.
[00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:06.040]   And--
[00:47:06.040 --> 00:47:06.960]   Yeah.
[00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:07.880]   And actually, he was--
[00:47:07.880 --> 00:47:09.920]   I remember he was quite bitter because eventually it was
[00:47:09.920 --> 00:47:11.680]   the cable companies that put them out of business.
[00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:12.160]   Yes.
[00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:13.920]   They wanted this for themselves.
[00:47:13.920 --> 00:47:15.120]   They weren't going to use it.
[00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:16.120]   They weren't going to use it.
[00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:16.320]   Yeah.
[00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:18.320]   Yeah.
[00:47:18.320 --> 00:47:23.400]   Google has announced that it's going to support microformats
[00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:25.560]   in place searching.
[00:47:25.560 --> 00:47:29.520]   And they've added a new place search.
[00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:32.200]   This maybe-- this is-- this kind of goes along with Marissa
[00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:35.760]   Meyer being sent to mobile and local.
[00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:38.040]   This is clearly the most important part of Google's business.
[00:47:38.040 --> 00:47:40.080]   So supporting microformats is interesting because it's
[00:47:40.080 --> 00:47:43.080]   basically encouraging anybody who writes about a location,
[00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:47.280]   including bloggers, to use an H card for that location, which
[00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:52.360]   Google can see and scrape and add to its database.
[00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:56.720]   So you have all this rich information about a place.
[00:47:56.720 --> 00:47:57.240]   Yeah.
[00:47:57.240 --> 00:47:59.000]   This is brilliant.
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:02.240]   I agree with John Patel, what he wrote a couple of weeks ago
[00:48:02.240 --> 00:48:06.480]   that local is the next big thing after the research.
[00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:09.800]   And then there was social, which Google kind of took a
[00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:10.360]   beating on.
[00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:12.680]   And now they're local, which Google is really already in
[00:48:12.680 --> 00:48:14.880]   the lead on.
[00:48:14.880 --> 00:48:17.120]   I mean, I've seen some analysis to say the opposite, to look
[00:48:17.120 --> 00:48:19.960]   at something like 4 Square and Facebook places and say the
[00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:20.920]   Google is behind.
[00:48:20.920 --> 00:48:23.720]   But in fact, the only thing I can assume is these people who
[00:48:23.720 --> 00:48:27.640]   say that aren't aware of Google's activity in local the
[00:48:27.640 --> 00:48:30.200]   way you're not aware of the air you breathe.
[00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:30.680]   Right.
[00:48:30.680 --> 00:48:33.520]   And everybody just goes on to Google every day to look
[00:48:33.520 --> 00:48:35.040]   up stores or whatever.
[00:48:35.040 --> 00:48:40.120]   So Google's really in great shape here.
[00:48:40.120 --> 00:48:40.880]   So this is gorgeous.
[00:48:40.880 --> 00:48:43.320]   And Mitch, the other thing is the revenue they have is that
[00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:46.880]   local advertisers are going to Google not to newspapers,
[00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:49.760]   not to the yellow pages, maybe rest in peace.
[00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:53.920]   But to Google and finding that it works, people search it
[00:48:53.920 --> 00:48:55.720]   for pizza will find pizza through Google ad.
[00:48:55.720 --> 00:48:57.920]   That's wildly powerful.
[00:48:57.920 --> 00:49:01.360]   So I'm trying to understand place search.
[00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:04.600]   This is from the official Google blog.
[00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:07.440]   I love to discover new places from sandwich shops.
[00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:10.040]   Sounds like Dr. Seuss.
[00:49:10.040 --> 00:49:12.240]   From sandwich shops in my neighborhood to great
[00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:15.160]   museums around the globe.
[00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:17.400]   So when I start looking for something new in an area, like
[00:49:17.400 --> 00:49:19.720]   a barbecue restaurant in Austin, I usually do quite a few
[00:49:19.720 --> 00:49:20.320]   searches.
[00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:21.360]   It gets a list.
[00:49:21.360 --> 00:49:23.440]   So today we're introducing place search, a new kind of
[00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:24.120]   local search.
[00:49:24.120 --> 00:49:26.800]   So is it so it's a different result page?
[00:49:26.800 --> 00:49:28.320]   Is that what I'm getting?
[00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:29.960]   The differences are not that big.
[00:49:29.960 --> 00:49:32.560]   Yeah, the result page is just a little different.
[00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:35.080]   So it shows a map on the right side.
[00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:36.840]   Right on the results page.
[00:49:36.840 --> 00:49:40.400]   And there's a places item in the left sidebar.
[00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:41.200]   It's not that different.
[00:49:41.200 --> 00:49:44.640]   I think Mitch's point about the fact that Google just is so
[00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:46.480]   good at local, but we don't even notice it.
[00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:47.200]   They already do it.
[00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:47.720]   Like that's how good it is.
[00:49:47.720 --> 00:49:48.920]   They already do it.
[00:49:48.920 --> 00:49:50.280]   Because I think an excellent one.
[00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:52.440]   It's like when you search for barbecue in Austin, you just
[00:49:52.440 --> 00:49:55.000]   kind of expect that Google is going to give you a good
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:55.200]   result.
[00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:56.200]   A map in dots.
[00:49:56.200 --> 00:49:57.200]   It's going to look good.
[00:49:57.200 --> 00:49:59.120]   Well, you expect to see a Google map and you expect to be
[00:49:59.120 --> 00:50:01.720]   able to get directions and see reviews and stars.
[00:50:01.720 --> 00:50:05.160]   And yeah, these place results look very good.
[00:50:05.160 --> 00:50:07.920]   This is what it used to look like.
[00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:09.440]   It's not that different.
[00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:11.800]   It's not that different.
[00:50:11.800 --> 00:50:12.920]   I couldn't see a difference.
[00:50:12.920 --> 00:50:13.920]   I don't even know if it rolled out.
[00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:14.280]   Let's see.
[00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:16.320]   They move this over to the left.
[00:50:16.320 --> 00:50:19.000]   And so that's what it used to look like.
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:20.160]   This is the new one.
[00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:22.240]   That's a very morissa change, isn't it?
[00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:22.440]   It is.
[00:50:22.440 --> 00:50:22.920]   You know what?
[00:50:22.920 --> 00:50:23.760]   That's morissa.
[00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:24.320]   Isn't it?
[00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:24.320]   It is.
[00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:25.320]   It is.
[00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:25.840]   It is.
[00:50:25.840 --> 00:50:27.600]   Don't mess it up.
[00:50:27.600 --> 00:50:28.320]   Test it out.
[00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:29.320]   Still got the map.
[00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:31.000]   Still got the ads.
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:34.200]   But now it's clearly when you get these results, these are
[00:50:34.200 --> 00:50:38.080]   much more place results because they have the little red
[00:50:38.080 --> 00:50:40.720]   marker and that goes correspond to the map.
[00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:42.080]   Yeah, it's useful.
[00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:44.160]   And it's also kind of a response to Bing, isn't it?
[00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:47.040]   I mean, isn't this the kind of thing that Bing?
[00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:48.720]   A little bit, yeah.
[00:50:48.720 --> 00:50:51.840]   Well, I wonder what habits we get into when we use mobile,
[00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:55.120]   or we're on the mobile device.
[00:50:55.120 --> 00:51:01.360]   And we speak to it and say, pizza, morris town.
[00:51:01.360 --> 00:51:05.000]   What are we-- they're going for how we're going to use it
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:09.320]   there, and that will affect the web and return, I think.
[00:51:09.320 --> 00:51:12.360]   We're talking about Google, the cloud, the cloud averse,
[00:51:12.360 --> 00:51:14.760]   or whatever that is, Mitch Wagner is here,
[00:51:14.760 --> 00:51:17.160]   formerly from Computer World, now on his own,
[00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:19.160]   twitter.com/michwagner.
[00:51:19.160 --> 00:51:21.680]   If you'd like to follow him, he's a freelancer.
[00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:24.360]   Gina Trapani, actually we're all freelancers.
[00:51:24.360 --> 00:51:25.200]   I'm the only guy with a real--
[00:51:25.200 --> 00:51:26.200]   Some way.
[00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:27.200]   He'd be using the boss.
[00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:28.240]   That doesn't sound.
[00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:29.240]   Actually, Jeff has a job.
[00:51:29.240 --> 00:51:29.920]   He's a professor.
[00:51:29.920 --> 00:51:30.680]   I have a government job.
[00:51:30.680 --> 00:51:31.880]   I have tenure.
[00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:32.920]   Oh, are you tenured?
[00:51:32.920 --> 00:51:34.320]   Are you tenured?
[00:51:34.320 --> 00:51:35.320]   Wow.
[00:51:35.320 --> 00:51:36.160]   They can't fire you.
[00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:37.400]   All the public trough.
[00:51:37.400 --> 00:51:38.880]   What do you have to do to get fired?
[00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:43.440]   I'm probably going to be a professor.
[00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:44.440]   No, I don't think so.
[00:51:44.440 --> 00:51:46.440]   I think you're pretty safe.
[00:51:46.440 --> 00:51:48.240]   By the way, what is that?
[00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:50.520]   A live boy or a dead girl or--
[00:51:50.520 --> 00:51:52.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:51:52.040 --> 00:51:53.240]   I ain't going there, Mitch.
[00:51:53.240 --> 00:51:56.360]   OK, let's move right along to our ad.
[00:51:56.360 --> 00:51:57.560]   They're so glad they're here.
[00:51:57.560 --> 00:52:00.000]   squarespace.com, my friends.
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:03.120]   We talk about blogging, and we talk about the web.
[00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:05.000]   And I'd like to give you a suggestion,
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:09.560]   if you want to have your own website that fills all the SEO
[00:52:09.560 --> 00:52:12.560]   niches, you know, it's got the Google site map and all of that.
[00:52:12.560 --> 00:52:13.520]   But a whole lot more.
[00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:15.480]   It's called squarespace.com.
[00:52:15.480 --> 00:52:17.920]   It is both hosting and software.
[00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:21.280]   The best darn website software you've ever seen.
[00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:24.840]   I mean, it's so easy to create a site.
[00:52:24.840 --> 00:52:29.280]   In fact, I'm going to go right now to inside twit.tv, which
[00:52:29.280 --> 00:52:30.440]   is our squarespace site.
[00:52:30.440 --> 00:52:32.400]   It's our in-house blog.
[00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:34.640]   We decided to use squarespace because it makes it so easy
[00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:37.840]   for all of us to post.
[00:52:37.840 --> 00:52:41.600]   And here's Gina right there on the front page, the Facebook
[00:52:41.600 --> 00:52:43.280]   condom from last week.
[00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:44.200]   All right.
[00:52:44.200 --> 00:52:48.920]   Here's Paul Thorett stabbing me in the head with scissors.
[00:52:48.920 --> 00:52:49.920]   You see?
[00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:51.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:52:51.480 --> 00:52:53.440]   Here's-- oh, man.
[00:52:53.440 --> 00:52:55.120]   Eileen, are you posting all this stuff?
[00:52:55.120 --> 00:52:56.760]   This is great.
[00:52:56.760 --> 00:52:57.800]   We've got our tweets there.
[00:52:57.800 --> 00:53:01.520]   You see how it ties into Twitter very easily.
[00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:02.640]   It's got Flickr.
[00:53:02.640 --> 00:53:06.160]   It's got great social integration, beautiful templates.
[00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:08.120]   And let me go to squarespace.com.
[00:53:08.120 --> 00:53:09.760]   Because the thing about squarespace
[00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:12.760]   is you could try it absolutely free for two weeks.
[00:53:12.760 --> 00:53:13.920]   You don't need a credit card.
[00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:17.280]   You just click the try it free button at squarespace.com.
[00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:19.400]   Create a site name, a password, an email address.
[00:53:19.400 --> 00:53:21.080]   So if you forget the password, you can get it again.
[00:53:21.080 --> 00:53:24.360]   And the capture there, so the robots can't do this.
[00:53:24.360 --> 00:53:26.760]   And you've got a site for two weeks free.
[00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:28.200]   And the first thing you should do
[00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:30.040]   is import the data from your old site.
[00:53:30.040 --> 00:53:33.160]   It does almost all the major blog and website platforms
[00:53:33.160 --> 00:53:33.920]   just seamlessly.
[00:53:33.920 --> 00:53:36.520]   So you get your content, even your comments,
[00:53:36.520 --> 00:53:38.480]   over there your images.
[00:53:38.480 --> 00:53:40.600]   Then play with the templates.
[00:53:40.600 --> 00:53:43.320]   The templates are stunning.
[00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:47.040]   You start with 60 plus professionally designed styles
[00:53:47.040 --> 00:53:48.280]   from big name designers.
[00:53:48.280 --> 00:53:52.160]   And then you're completely customizable.
[00:53:52.160 --> 00:53:55.440]   And you don't have to know any special coding or anything.
[00:53:55.440 --> 00:53:59.360]   You just drag and drop this, click, point, and all of that.
[00:53:59.360 --> 00:54:01.880]   Now, if you do know CSS and JavaScript, of course,
[00:54:01.880 --> 00:54:03.440]   it completely supports that as well.
[00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:05.360]   So you could do anything you want.
[00:54:05.360 --> 00:54:06.160]   Very powerful.
[00:54:06.160 --> 00:54:07.400]   And that's one of the reasons if you
[00:54:07.400 --> 00:54:10.520]   go to the squarespace examples squarespace.com.
[00:54:10.520 --> 00:54:12.680]   And look at the example sites.
[00:54:12.680 --> 00:54:14.360]   You'll see each one of them looks different.
[00:54:14.360 --> 00:54:16.520]   Here's a core sellers.
[00:54:16.520 --> 00:54:18.200]   This is a winery.
[00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:21.640]   Oh man, that's beautiful.
[00:54:21.640 --> 00:54:25.640]   Here is Jodi Arnold.
[00:54:25.640 --> 00:54:29.360]   They're selling, I guess it looks like jewelry.
[00:54:29.360 --> 00:54:30.920]   They've got their own podcast here.
[00:54:30.920 --> 00:54:32.480]   Every squarespace site looks different.
[00:54:32.480 --> 00:54:35.200]   But I can tell you one thing that they all have in common.
[00:54:35.200 --> 00:54:36.720]   They never run out of bandwidth.
[00:54:36.720 --> 00:54:38.320]   They're always reliable.
[00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:39.680]   And you never have security issues
[00:54:39.680 --> 00:54:41.560]   because squarespace keeps that software up to date.
[00:54:41.560 --> 00:54:43.280]   Start at $12 a month.
[00:54:43.280 --> 00:54:46.160]   But you're going to get 10% off for the life of your site
[00:54:46.160 --> 00:54:49.120]   if you use a squarespace promo code TWIG,
[00:54:49.120 --> 00:54:50.880]   T-W-I-G when you sign up.
[00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:52.680]   Try it free for two weeks.
[00:54:52.680 --> 00:54:55.280]   Then if you sign up, remember to use a promo code TWIG.
[00:54:55.280 --> 00:54:56.400]   You'll get two months--
[00:54:56.400 --> 00:54:59.600]   I'm sorry, you'll get to 10% off for the life of your site.
[00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:00.720]   squarespace.com.
[00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:03.200]   It's where exceptional websites begin.
[00:55:03.200 --> 00:55:07.040]   And take a look at our squarespace site inside.twit.tv.
[00:55:07.040 --> 00:55:11.280]   For an idea of what you can do with squarespace.
[00:55:11.280 --> 00:55:12.560]   Let's say continuing on--
[00:55:12.560 --> 00:55:18.640]   we mentioned microphone-- oh, did you see this?
[00:55:18.640 --> 00:55:20.920]   This is an Android story, I guess.
[00:55:20.920 --> 00:55:22.560]   And I almost don't even believe this.
[00:55:22.560 --> 00:55:26.640]   But do you see in gadget says that this awful looking
[00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:30.240]   PlayStation phone is real?
[00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:32.000]   Did you see that, guys?
[00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:33.000]   Hmm.
[00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:37.040]   It is obviously Android not customized.
[00:55:37.040 --> 00:55:38.640]   It's a Sony Ericsson.
[00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:41.400]   And gadgets have been talking about this since August.
[00:55:41.400 --> 00:55:42.880]   Is it April 1?
[00:55:42.880 --> 00:55:43.720]   I thought so.
[00:55:43.720 --> 00:55:44.640]   I looked-- you know what?
[00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:45.040]   It's funny.
[00:55:45.040 --> 00:55:46.000]   I had the same reaction.
[00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:48.080]   But it's Josh Topolsky, who was very credible.
[00:55:48.080 --> 00:55:50.680]   And he wrote this yesterday.
[00:55:50.680 --> 00:55:53.720]   But he says this is absolutely factual.
[00:55:53.720 --> 00:55:55.960]   It's probably going to run gingerbread.
[00:55:55.960 --> 00:55:58.120]   Android 3.0.
[00:55:58.120 --> 00:56:03.040]   Get this, a custom Sony marketplace.
[00:56:03.040 --> 00:56:03.640]   What's up?
[00:56:03.640 --> 00:56:07.280]   Yeah, maybe just for games.
[00:56:07.280 --> 00:56:08.440]   This is weird.
[00:56:08.440 --> 00:56:10.720]   That screenshot looks kind of-- I mean, I trust Josh too.
[00:56:10.720 --> 00:56:14.360]   But I mean, he looks just kind of like overlapping.
[00:56:14.360 --> 00:56:16.600]   And I don't know.
[00:56:16.600 --> 00:56:17.880]   What's kind of suspicious?
[00:56:17.880 --> 00:56:20.000]   And his battery's dying too.
[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:22.160]   Battery's dying, and that no sim card
[00:56:22.160 --> 00:56:26.240]   is kind of overlaid on emergency calls only.
[00:56:26.240 --> 00:56:26.640]   Well--
[00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:27.640]   But OK.
[00:56:27.640 --> 00:56:31.160]   He says it's a Qualcomm gigahertz chip,
[00:56:31.160 --> 00:56:32.280]   like the one in the G2.
[00:56:32.280 --> 00:56:35.000]   It's 512 megs of RAM, a gig of ROM.
[00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:39.840]   Screen is 3.7 to 4.1 inches.
[00:56:39.840 --> 00:56:41.520]   You know, if you think about it, though,
[00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:46.160]   Sony, we're going to make a--
[00:56:46.160 --> 00:56:46.640]   I don't know.
[00:56:46.640 --> 00:56:49.600]   There's no excuse for it.
[00:56:49.600 --> 00:56:56.800]   They just basically glued gamepad onto an Android phone.
[00:56:56.800 --> 00:56:58.600]   There have been rumors of Apple will buy Sony.
[00:56:58.600 --> 00:57:00.480]   That would be the first thing they would kill if they did.
[00:57:00.480 --> 00:57:02.160]   I could tell you that.
[00:57:02.160 --> 00:57:02.920]   Now, slash--
[00:57:02.920 --> 00:57:06.240]   I think that's pretty absurd, but Disney?
[00:57:06.240 --> 00:57:07.360]   Now, Disney's interesting.
[00:57:07.360 --> 00:57:10.000]   We talked actually yesterday about the idea
[00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:11.520]   of Adam McPryk, quickly, of Apple.
[00:57:11.520 --> 00:57:13.960]   You know, they got $51 billion cash
[00:57:13.960 --> 00:57:15.600]   burning a hole in their pocket.
[00:57:15.600 --> 00:57:17.800]   They implied on their earnings call last week
[00:57:17.800 --> 00:57:20.200]   that they were keeping their powder drive for something.
[00:57:20.200 --> 00:57:22.920]   But they did say there were some good acquisitions out there.
[00:57:22.920 --> 00:57:24.240]   And then we talked about-- and I'd
[00:57:24.240 --> 00:57:25.240]   be curious what you guys think.
[00:57:25.240 --> 00:57:28.800]   We talked about the idea of acquiring a content player.
[00:57:28.800 --> 00:57:30.240]   Now, Sony is a content company.
[00:57:30.240 --> 00:57:32.760]   I mean, big music-- one of the big music companies.
[00:57:32.760 --> 00:57:33.720]   Big movie companies.
[00:57:33.720 --> 00:57:34.840]   TV.
[00:57:34.840 --> 00:57:37.720]   So Sony, if you maybe divested the consumer electronics--
[00:57:37.720 --> 00:57:40.600]   because Apple definitely doesn't want that crap--
[00:57:40.600 --> 00:57:42.080]   but you kept the content.
[00:57:42.080 --> 00:57:44.480]   Maybe that's why you'd buy a Sony.
[00:57:44.480 --> 00:57:44.980]   Yeah.
[00:57:44.980 --> 00:57:46.480]   And they turned around all that.
[00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:47.800]   They got a retail chain.
[00:57:47.800 --> 00:57:48.680]   They got other things.
[00:57:48.680 --> 00:57:50.560]   But here's the risk.
[00:57:50.560 --> 00:57:53.680]   Mitch and Gina, well, especially Gina here.
[00:57:53.680 --> 00:57:55.760]   Have you ever actually seen a Walkman?
[00:57:55.760 --> 00:57:59.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:57:59.120 --> 00:58:00.280]   Of course.
[00:58:00.280 --> 00:58:03.200]   I bought a cassette Walkman in '19.
[00:58:03.200 --> 00:58:04.200]   Yes.
[00:58:04.200 --> 00:58:07.640]   I bought one from Flatter that you include me among the people
[00:58:07.640 --> 00:58:08.280]   who are two--
[00:58:08.280 --> 00:58:09.200]   I thought twice up it.
[00:58:09.200 --> 00:58:09.700]   OK.
[00:58:09.700 --> 00:58:10.880]   You think you can stay there?
[00:58:10.880 --> 00:58:11.200]   Yeah.
[00:58:11.200 --> 00:58:12.760]   I bought one for $400.
[00:58:12.760 --> 00:58:15.840]   When they first came out, I bought it at Macy's
[00:58:15.840 --> 00:58:17.280]   and charged it, of course.
[00:58:17.280 --> 00:58:21.040]   Like I did my first Mac as well, because I couldn't afford either.
[00:58:21.040 --> 00:58:23.160]   Now, there was a story floating around on the internet
[00:58:23.160 --> 00:58:23.840]   a couple of days ago.
[00:58:23.840 --> 00:58:28.760]   So it must be true that Steve Jobs and Wozniak were actually
[00:58:28.760 --> 00:58:31.000]   just totally inspired by the Walkman.
[00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:31.680]   I believe that.
[00:58:31.680 --> 00:58:32.960]   And first came out.
[00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:34.840]   I believe Jobs more than Woz.
[00:58:34.840 --> 00:58:37.600]   I'll ask Woz next time, because we talk to him from time to time.
[00:58:37.600 --> 00:58:38.080]   I'll ask Wozniak.
[00:58:38.080 --> 00:58:39.640]   I was really inspired by the Disc Man,
[00:58:39.640 --> 00:58:41.880]   because you could skip to the next song.
[00:58:41.880 --> 00:58:42.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:58:42.880 --> 00:58:45.280]   And, personally, instead of having to hit the fast forward button.
[00:58:45.280 --> 00:58:46.440]   Yeah, that was a pain in the butt.
[00:58:46.440 --> 00:58:46.880]   And stop.
[00:58:46.880 --> 00:58:48.200]   That was always a pain.
[00:58:48.200 --> 00:58:50.680]   I thought the eight tracks were superior to cassette tapes.
[00:58:50.680 --> 00:58:51.840]   So no one should take me seriously.
[00:58:51.840 --> 00:58:52.360]   Oh, dear.
[00:58:52.360 --> 00:58:53.000]   Oh, dear.
[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:55.680]   Were you a beta Mac Sky Mitch?
[00:58:55.680 --> 00:58:57.280]   No, it never was.
[00:58:57.280 --> 00:58:59.280]   The time I got into video cassettes,
[00:58:59.280 --> 00:59:02.040]   I was already up to the VCRs.
[00:59:02.040 --> 00:59:03.840]   So here's what Sone's response was.
[00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:04.960]   This is from Slash Gear.
[00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:09.800]   They were asked by a website called Now Gamer for official comment.
[00:59:09.800 --> 00:59:13.760]   Initially, Sone said the leak was definitely fake.
[00:59:13.760 --> 00:59:16.480]   Then they called back.
[00:59:16.480 --> 00:59:19.000]   And they said, can you take that quote down?
[00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:21.840]   And our response is, we do not comment on rumor
[00:59:21.840 --> 00:59:24.040]   and speculation.
[00:59:24.040 --> 00:59:26.280]   That's a non-conformation confirmation in my book.
[00:59:26.280 --> 00:59:30.200]   That's a lawyer, too.
[00:59:30.200 --> 00:59:33.320]   But they don't want to deny it.
[00:59:33.320 --> 00:59:33.880]   I would deny it.
[00:59:33.880 --> 00:59:34.360]   Never did that.
[00:59:34.360 --> 00:59:36.360]   It's just laughing at the head games now.
[00:59:36.360 --> 00:59:37.480]   Check out what we did.
[00:59:37.480 --> 00:59:39.960]   What messing with you now?
[00:59:39.960 --> 00:59:42.480]   What I'm messing with you.
[00:59:42.480 --> 00:59:44.480]   But I was surprised, Gingerbread.
[00:59:44.480 --> 00:59:47.360]   But apparently, Gingerbread is finished.
[00:59:47.360 --> 00:59:50.160]   They're just pumping out Android versions.
[00:59:50.160 --> 00:59:50.720]   Wow.
[00:59:50.720 --> 00:59:53.120]   So when are we going to see?
[00:59:53.120 --> 00:59:54.600]   Good question.
[00:59:54.600 --> 00:59:55.840]   So here's a video.
[00:59:55.840 --> 00:59:59.640]   This is from the Android developer's YouTube page.
[00:59:59.640 --> 01:00:06.320]   Is this the Google campus?
[01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:07.280]   I think it is.
[01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:10.280]   Yeah, it is.
[01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:12.600]   There's a big truck pulling up.
[01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:14.760]   Now, you've got to know that on the Google campus,
[01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:18.200]   they have these statues.
[01:00:18.200 --> 01:00:18.920]   What is that?
[01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:19.640]   What could be in there?
[01:00:20.640 --> 01:00:22.880]   Oh, they're gathering around the truck.
[01:00:22.880 --> 01:00:25.040]   They're pulling something out of the truck.
[01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:29.120]   Oh, it's a Gingerbread man.
[01:00:29.120 --> 01:00:32.920]   They have these statues for each version of Android.
[01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:34.840]   They've got a fro-yo.
[01:00:34.840 --> 01:00:36.840]   Jake and I took pictures of ourselves with them.
[01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:38.040]   And a claire.
[01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:38.720]   Nice.
[01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:41.480]   And this is-- they've got a Gingerbread statue,
[01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:45.120]   and they're adding it to the garden.
[01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:47.640]   A giant Gingerbread man makes me afraid.
[01:00:47.640 --> 01:00:49.640]   I'm going to be having nightmares about the crease.
[01:00:49.640 --> 01:00:52.080]   It's scarier than Eric Schmidt.
[01:00:52.080 --> 01:00:54.080]   That's just a line of creepy.
[01:00:54.080 --> 01:00:56.160]   It doesn't cross it.
[01:00:56.160 --> 01:00:57.440]   Help me.
[01:00:57.440 --> 01:00:58.440]   Oh, no.
[01:00:58.440 --> 01:01:01.040]   Mr. Bill.
[01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:03.040]   My candy buttons.
[01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:04.040]   What is that?
[01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:05.640]   What does that--
[01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:08.640]   it stuck a stand on me.
[01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:11.640]   I have to hang out here for the rest of my life.
[01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:12.840]   Where's Eric?
[01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:15.400]   Hey, Eric.
[01:01:15.400 --> 01:01:18.560]   It's so frustrating that there's that video and nothing else.
[01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:20.840]   Like, we don't have a release date.
[01:01:20.840 --> 01:01:23.160]   There's rumors of speculation, but there's just the video.
[01:01:23.160 --> 01:01:24.160]   It's like, OK.
[01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:27.080]   Now there's speculation about Android chubby,
[01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:28.000]   they--
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.120]   Nexus 2 in Europe.
[01:01:29.120 --> 01:01:30.840]   Nexus 2, yes.
[01:01:30.840 --> 01:01:32.760]   Nixxix, don't mix this one.
[01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:34.120]   Who knows?
[01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:35.480]   Android Marketplace.
[01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:36.760]   I don't know if this is your number, Jeff.
[01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:38.000]   Stop me.
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:38.920]   I give up on my number.
[01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:39.960]   Are you already pretty?
[01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:41.360]   I did your number?
[01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:42.800]   Sorry, I don't find another one.
[01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:45.000]   Damn, I suck.
[01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:51.000]   Android Marketplace, 100,000 apps, 100,000.
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.400]   They're really ramping up fast.
[01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:55.120]   It looks to me like they're growing faster now
[01:01:55.120 --> 01:01:58.480]   than the Apple marketplace.
[01:01:58.480 --> 01:01:59.440]   Good growth, right?
[01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:01.880]   But still, not as easy for developers as it could be.
[01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:05.360]   The Times in an article, which the headline was that the Android
[01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:07.320]   market is attracting more developers.
[01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:09.640]   But the content on the article was saying that things
[01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:12.800]   could be a little easier for developers and for users.
[01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:13.480]   We're getting there.
[01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:14.320]   We're getting there.
[01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:17.200]   Is it true there's no Netflix app for Android yet?
[01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:18.360]   No, that's a good point.
[01:02:18.360 --> 01:02:19.280]   Oh, man.
[01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:19.800]   That's true.
[01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:21.920]   There's for the iPhone and iPad, and there, of course,
[01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:23.280]   the desktop.
[01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:25.200]   Yeah, that's a killer.
[01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:28.600]   Does that have something to do with Google TV?
[01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:31.560]   I think it's just-- you know, I just think it's a developer.
[01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:32.680]   It just takes time.
[01:02:32.680 --> 01:02:33.560]   Yeah, it just takes time.
[01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:34.240]   It just takes time.
[01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:35.560]   So at this point, everybody who
[01:02:35.560 --> 01:02:37.920]   wants to be on a portable platform is looking at writing
[01:02:37.920 --> 01:02:39.720]   an Android version, I have to think.
[01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:40.640]   Yes.
[01:02:40.640 --> 01:02:41.560]   Yes.
[01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:42.080]   But the economy--
[01:02:42.080 --> 01:02:45.320]   According to The Times, this is a gathering of Android programmers
[01:02:45.320 --> 01:02:47.160]   in downtown Manhattan.
[01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:49.760]   According to The Times, one software developer James Engleert
[01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:52.160]   just released his first app for Android.
[01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:53.960]   This could be your number.
[01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:56.240]   When asked, he tossed out an estimate of his take
[01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:58.960]   from Sales of the App, a simple program that
[01:02:58.960 --> 01:02:59.960]   shows train schedules.
[01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:02.160]   He says, ah, I'm making a buck or two a day.
[01:03:02.160 --> 01:03:03.640]   Yes.
[01:03:03.640 --> 01:03:05.320]   Yeah.
[01:03:05.320 --> 01:03:08.080]   That's not very motivating.
[01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:10.760]   Not very motivating.
[01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:11.680]   Why do you think that is?
[01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:15.840]   In fact, far more apps are free on Android
[01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:17.680]   than they are on the iPhone.
[01:03:17.680 --> 01:03:19.800]   Yeah, a lot more developers opting for ads, right?
[01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:23.720]   AdMob ads versus having them pay for.
[01:03:23.720 --> 01:03:25.400]   I think parts are cultural.
[01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:26.840]   Parts of it is that it's just hard.
[01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:27.800]   It's harder to buy an app.
[01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:30.360]   Google-- the Google checkout experience isn't as simple,
[01:03:30.360 --> 01:03:31.680]   as easy as it could be.
[01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:33.680]   But it's getting better.
[01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:35.560]   And but part of it definitely is cultural.
[01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:37.440]   You know, Google's a service that runs on ads.
[01:03:37.440 --> 01:03:38.520]   It's an open source culture.
[01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:41.520]   So it's a sense of things should be free.
[01:03:41.520 --> 01:03:42.760]   But I don't agree with that, though.
[01:03:42.760 --> 01:03:45.560]   I mean, if you write a great Android app, I'll pay for it.
[01:03:45.560 --> 01:03:47.800]   People are used to buying apps on their phone.
[01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:49.880]   And I think developers should maybe
[01:03:49.880 --> 01:03:53.840]   be a little more aggressive about pricing their apps.
[01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:56.640]   But Google has to make it easier to buy those apps
[01:03:56.640 --> 01:03:57.600]   as an impulse buy.
[01:03:57.600 --> 01:04:00.040]   It should be just a really easy single tap.
[01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:03.400]   When people say, why do you like Android better than iPhone?
[01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:05.640]   One of the things-- they always are bad-mouthing
[01:04:05.640 --> 01:04:06.560]   the Android marketplace.
[01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:08.400]   But there's one thing you can do on Android.
[01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:09.880]   You cannot do on the iPhone.
[01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:12.320]   It is return an item.
[01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:16.320]   There's no way to test an app on the iOS platform.
[01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:16.840]   You bought it.
[01:04:16.840 --> 01:04:17.800]   It's yours.
[01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:18.440]   You can hate it.
[01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:19.200]   It doesn't matter.
[01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:21.040]   But you have 24 hours to delete any app
[01:04:21.040 --> 01:04:22.800]   and get your money back on Android.
[01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:24.760]   I think that's huge.
[01:04:24.760 --> 01:04:25.520]   That is nice.
[01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:28.280]   And Apple's benefit is that they do more
[01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:29.800]   foreign currencies, I believe.
[01:04:29.800 --> 01:04:30.360]   Buy a long--
[01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:30.760]   Oh, yeah.
[01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:32.760]   And that's been a problem, hasn't it?
[01:04:32.760 --> 01:04:36.400]   A lot of international developers say we can't sell.
[01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:38.800]   Now, Google at least now translates the euros
[01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:40.480]   into dollars.
[01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:41.240]   That's helpful.
[01:04:41.240 --> 01:04:42.400]   And vice versa.
[01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:46.520]   I figure, how much could 15-year-old be?
[01:04:46.520 --> 01:04:47.440]   Or whatever.
[01:04:47.440 --> 01:04:49.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:52.520]   I don't know how much it is, but how much could it be?
[01:04:52.520 --> 01:04:53.000]   Real.
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.480]   That's not going to end well.
[01:04:55.480 --> 01:04:58.480]   What's a thousand-year-old here or there?
[01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:00.080]   I always like actually paying in euros,
[01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:03.400]   because it seems like everything's less expensive.
[01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:06.120]   New Android device, it's the Nook in color.
[01:05:06.120 --> 01:05:08.520]   Barnes and Noble, it's successor to the original Nook.
[01:05:08.520 --> 01:05:10.720]   Of course, they're in a dog fight
[01:05:10.720 --> 01:05:14.640]   with Amazon over the Kindle, this e-book reader.
[01:05:14.640 --> 01:05:19.720]   Their Nook is a 7-inch Android 2.1-powered tablet
[01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:23.960]   on available for pre-order at bn.com for $250,
[01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:25.880]   expect to ship November 19th.
[01:05:25.880 --> 01:05:27.040]   And then they hamper it.
[01:05:27.040 --> 01:05:28.600]   It's not really Android.
[01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:30.840]   Yeah, there's no Android markets.
[01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:32.040]   There's no market.
[01:05:32.040 --> 01:05:34.880]   There's no market, so you can't run other apps.
[01:05:34.880 --> 01:05:36.640]   They do have Wi-Fi, no 3G support.
[01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:37.200]   That is too bad.
[01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:42.880]   So for instance, I couldn't also put Kindle on it.
[01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:43.680]   Right.
[01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:44.040]   Right.
[01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:46.600]   You know what that might actually make it valuable
[01:05:46.600 --> 01:05:47.960]   if I could get the best of both worlds
[01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:51.280]   and get a little tablet for a cheap price, that'd be fine.
[01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:53.040]   Wi-Fi, I might do that.
[01:05:53.040 --> 01:05:59.200]   Google, you were saying Google's giving 10,000 Google TVs
[01:05:59.200 --> 01:06:02.520]   to developers, wrong direction, but they are doing,
[01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:04.200]   actually I'm not going to say what they're doing
[01:06:04.200 --> 01:06:08.200]   for journalists, Jeff.
[01:06:08.200 --> 01:06:10.680]   It's a number.
[01:06:10.680 --> 01:06:12.200]   I wouldn't.
[01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:15.600]   No, I'm just saying.
[01:06:15.600 --> 01:06:18.200]   I'll mention it if you don't, I'll mention it later.
[01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:19.680]   You guys want to talk about WikiLeaks?
[01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:23.640]   Because the stories are now out.
[01:06:23.640 --> 01:06:28.920]   The 400,000 new secret Iraq docks.
[01:06:28.920 --> 01:06:31.440]   And it does seem as if a lot of people are saying,
[01:06:31.440 --> 01:06:32.960]   well, this is-- we already knew most of this stuff.
[01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:33.480]   Yes.
[01:06:33.480 --> 01:06:38.480]   Meanwhile, Julius Assange is acting like he's America's most
[01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:40.280]   wanted, but she might be.
[01:06:40.280 --> 01:06:42.960]   Well, but you know, I'm waiting for Sorkin
[01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:44.480]   to do the Assange movie.
[01:06:44.480 --> 01:06:46.080]   Wouldn't that be a great movie?
[01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:47.440]   It actually would be interesting.
[01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:53.160]   But people who start audacious things are generally
[01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:55.200]   assets.
[01:06:55.200 --> 01:06:55.700]   Right?
[01:06:55.700 --> 01:06:57.280]   Isn't that the kind of message?
[01:06:57.280 --> 01:07:01.160]   It takes a certain type of person
[01:07:01.160 --> 01:07:05.120]   who's got such a strong sense of self
[01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:07.840]   and such a strong belief in what he or she is doing,
[01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:10.480]   that they're willing to become pariahs.
[01:07:10.480 --> 01:07:13.680]   And he's absolutely a pariah in some circles
[01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:16.680]   and probably has a price on his head
[01:07:16.680 --> 01:07:20.240]   with at least US intelligence, I would imagine.
[01:07:20.240 --> 01:07:21.800]   One of the most fascinating things for me, just
[01:07:21.800 --> 01:07:24.200]   as a journalist, besides the idea of--
[01:07:24.200 --> 01:07:26.800]   they say the internet is all opinion, opinion, opinion.
[01:07:26.800 --> 01:07:29.520]   Well, this is fact, fact, fact.
[01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:34.680]   And the display of this data across various media sites
[01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:35.200]   was fascinating.
[01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:37.560]   I think it's data visualization journalism really
[01:07:37.560 --> 01:07:40.480]   came into its own with the story.
[01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:43.280]   Their Spiegel and Germany did a superb job
[01:07:43.280 --> 01:07:46.000]   of allowing you to navigate by kinds of deaths,
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:49.440]   kinds of accidents, kinds of events across geography,
[01:07:49.440 --> 01:07:51.800]   across time.
[01:07:51.800 --> 01:07:57.480]   Oveni, O-W-N-I dot FR, did four WikiLeaks,
[01:07:57.480 --> 01:07:59.360]   the crowdsourced application where people
[01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:01.160]   can come in and go through the documents
[01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:03.400]   and flag the ones that are interesting
[01:08:03.400 --> 01:08:06.720]   or that might need more attention.
[01:08:06.720 --> 01:08:08.320]   The Guardian always does a good job
[01:08:08.320 --> 01:08:09.840]   with these kinds of graphics.
[01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:10.720]   The Times did some.
[01:08:10.720 --> 01:08:12.320]   So it was really interesting that you had a story that
[01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:15.840]   was fully based on data and facts and documents and source
[01:08:15.840 --> 01:08:18.880]   data, not on stories and narratives.
[01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:20.440]   And it really changed, I think, the way
[01:08:20.440 --> 01:08:22.080]   that we can start to look at journalism.
[01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:23.280]   These are original sources.
[01:08:23.280 --> 01:08:24.560]   These aren't exactly--
[01:08:24.560 --> 01:08:25.760]   Yeah.
[01:08:25.760 --> 01:08:26.960]   Any of you know, the bigger question
[01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:29.920]   for what I'm working on with the book
[01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:31.440]   is it fascinates me that it really
[01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:34.000]   does more and more kill off the idea that you can do anything,
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.840]   even a war and secret.
[01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:39.440]   There's a damn good chance that you're going to get exposed.
[01:08:39.440 --> 01:08:40.680]   And so what does that mean?
[01:08:40.680 --> 01:08:42.120]   Well, it means that we're watching you.
[01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:43.320]   And I'm hoping that's better.
[01:08:43.320 --> 01:08:49.120]   Uh-oh.
[01:08:49.120 --> 01:08:51.440]   It's even worse than doing this week in Glee's,
[01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:53.760]   this week in journalism.
[01:08:53.760 --> 01:08:55.120]   You know, you're confusing, sir.
[01:08:55.120 --> 01:08:57.560]   I gotta say, Jeff, you cover the range, though.
[01:08:57.560 --> 01:08:58.760]   That's the amazing thing.
[01:08:58.760 --> 01:09:00.640]   Pitching for the new show, Leo, that's all.
[01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:02.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:09:02.400 --> 01:09:03.960]   I just want to consider--
[01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:10.040]   Considering secrecy is a necessary component of war.
[01:09:10.040 --> 01:09:11.520]   Or maybe just wars have to be fought--
[01:09:11.520 --> 01:09:12.520]   It is.
[01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:13.440]   I don't know.
[01:09:13.440 --> 01:09:14.480]   It is, just the most debt.
[01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:16.440]   And certainly while you're doing it, absolutely.
[01:09:16.440 --> 01:09:25.000]   But at some point, is it possible to wage war without--
[01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:26.200]   The Alkbee stuff?
[01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:27.400]   Well, that's secret.
[01:09:27.400 --> 01:09:28.360]   Is it because I don't know?
[01:09:28.360 --> 01:09:29.080]   I think it is.
[01:09:29.080 --> 01:09:30.400]   But that's maybe--
[01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:33.960]   If Wikileaks had existed during World War II,
[01:09:33.960 --> 01:09:35.040]   we would have lost.
[01:09:35.040 --> 01:09:35.680]   We would have won.
[01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:36.760]   I don't know.
[01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:37.840]   Yeah, I don't know.
[01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:40.080]   There was a lot of disclosure during World War II.
[01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:43.160]   The press corps was more for better or for worse,
[01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:46.640]   more willing to cooperate in keeping certain things secret.
[01:09:46.640 --> 01:09:47.160]   That's true.
[01:09:47.160 --> 01:09:48.320]   Well, think about-- you know, I mean,
[01:09:48.320 --> 01:09:52.600]   I think we were able to deny Nazi anti-Semitism for a lot
[01:09:52.600 --> 01:09:54.160]   longer than we should have been able to deny it.
[01:09:54.160 --> 01:09:57.800]   And kept the United States out of the war for a lot longer.
[01:09:57.800 --> 01:10:01.400]   So perhaps that could have brought the US into the war sooner?
[01:10:01.400 --> 01:10:02.280]   I don't know.
[01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:04.880]   I read an essay recently that argued that with Wikileaks,
[01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:07.160]   we might have prevented 9/11.
[01:10:07.160 --> 01:10:08.280]   Bit specious, but it said--
[01:10:08.280 --> 01:10:09.080]   Yeah, I saw that.
[01:10:09.080 --> 01:10:10.200]   That's hard to believe.
[01:10:10.200 --> 01:10:11.120]   Yeah, it was.
[01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:14.080]   But if the guy who wrote the famous memo saying,
[01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:15.280]   watch out their--
[01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:15.800]   Right.
[01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:17.680]   --registration for aviation classes
[01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:19.280]   had gotten frustrated and had a place
[01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:22.280]   that he could have dropped that memo.
[01:10:22.280 --> 01:10:22.800]   True.
[01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:23.600]   That had done.
[01:10:23.600 --> 01:10:24.100]   True.
[01:10:24.100 --> 01:10:27.240]   I mean, George Tennant was telling President Bush,
[01:10:27.240 --> 01:10:27.880]   they're coming.
[01:10:27.880 --> 01:10:28.440]   They're coming.
[01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:31.280]   And he was going, eh.
[01:10:31.280 --> 01:10:36.040]   I do think that atrocities are an inevitable by-product of war.
[01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:37.880]   They're committed by all sides.
[01:10:37.880 --> 01:10:39.720]   And therefore, something like Wikileaks
[01:10:39.720 --> 01:10:41.320]   is beneficial for pointing that out
[01:10:41.320 --> 01:10:45.320]   so people will take it more seriously before going into war.
[01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:47.480]   Yeah, that's a good point, Mitch.
[01:10:47.480 --> 01:10:50.320]   Not a bad idea not to have illusions
[01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:52.240]   about what you're entering into.
[01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:58.160]   Though, when Leo and I grew up, we watched the Vietnam War on--
[01:10:58.160 --> 01:11:00.600]   First and the first TV war.
[01:11:00.600 --> 01:11:01.640]   Did that affect us?
[01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:02.640]   Did that--
[01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:03.140]   It did.
[01:11:03.140 --> 01:11:04.480]   You were infected a generation.
[01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:05.960]   I think it really did.
[01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:06.960]   I think it truly did.
[01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:09.920]   I think that there was a lot of reluctance after Vietnam
[01:11:09.920 --> 01:11:12.720]   for our generation to get involved in that again.
[01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:14.360]   It took another generation to come along.
[01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:15.080]   It didn't remember.
[01:11:15.080 --> 01:11:16.600]   It didn't grow up with that.
[01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:18.080]   And then you had the first Gulf War,
[01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:20.720]   where everything was clamped down very nicely.
[01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:22.520]   And all the TV pictures you saw
[01:11:22.520 --> 01:11:24.680]   looked exactly like the video games of that.
[01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:25.200]   Right.
[01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:26.400]   Kind of 8-bit graphics.
[01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:29.040]   And either the crew's missiles come into the house
[01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:31.240]   and go right down the chimney and only kill bad people.
[01:11:31.240 --> 01:11:33.360]   Perfect.
[01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:35.480]   But I'm not saying these wars were wrong.
[01:11:35.480 --> 01:11:37.400]   I have my own personal opinion on them.
[01:11:37.400 --> 01:11:40.480]   But I do think that many, many Americans
[01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:44.920]   failed to take it seriously enough going in.
[01:11:44.920 --> 01:11:45.920]   One more story--
[01:11:45.920 --> 01:11:46.600]   You're a citizen.
[01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:47.760]   We'll get to our picks of the week.
[01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:49.120]   And that is the--
[01:11:49.120 --> 01:11:49.960]   There's not much to say.
[01:11:49.960 --> 01:11:51.320]   We talked about it on Twitch.
[01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:53.640]   The Dutch sandwich and the Irish--
[01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:57.200]   what is it, the Irish surprise?
[01:11:57.200 --> 01:11:59.040]   That was a great conversation.
[01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:00.320]   It's about a T-O-W-O.
[01:12:00.320 --> 01:12:01.160]   Yeah, it does.
[01:12:01.160 --> 01:12:03.000]   It sounds like something from the Urban Dictionary.
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:06.040]   It's called the Double Irish and the Dutch sandwich.
[01:12:06.040 --> 01:12:08.840]   It's a technique that, frankly, all US
[01:12:08.840 --> 01:12:11.040]   multinational corporations use.
[01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:14.720]   It's estimated that the US loses $60 billion a year in taxes
[01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:19.080]   to these techniques, which basically funnel money off shore.
[01:12:19.080 --> 01:12:22.080]   Ireland doesn't have a corporate tax.
[01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:25.080]   So Google lowered its--
[01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:28.080]   and this is kind of actually offensive.
[01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:31.080]   Google-- the nominal corporate tax rate in the US is 35%.
[01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:34.080]   Google pays 2.4% in taxes.
[01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:38.080]   And they did it by selling the intellectual property rights
[01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:40.080]   to Ireland, to a subsidiary in Ireland.
[01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:42.080]   That's the Double Irish.
[01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:47.080]   And then so a lot of the income ends up in Ireland
[01:12:47.080 --> 01:12:48.080]   where it's not taxed.
[01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:52.080]   And then they send it through a Dutch subsidiary to Bermuda.
[01:12:52.080 --> 01:12:56.080]   And I know where it knows where it goes from there.
[01:12:56.080 --> 01:12:58.080]   But that's a lot of taxes.
[01:12:58.080 --> 01:13:01.080]   That's billions of dollars in taxes lost to the US.
[01:13:01.080 --> 01:13:03.080]   I don't know what the answer is to this.
[01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:04.080]   It's completely legal.
[01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:06.080]   Well, and here's the further question
[01:13:06.080 --> 01:13:07.080]   I was wondering about this.
[01:13:07.080 --> 01:13:10.080]   If they didn't do that, would they have issues
[01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:11.080]   of fiduciary responsibility?
[01:13:11.080 --> 01:13:12.080]   I'm sure.
[01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:13.080]   Terreholders.
[01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:14.080]   Would they get sued by shareholders?
[01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:17.080]   Yeah, if there's a legal way to legally avoid
[01:13:17.080 --> 01:13:19.080]   or lower your taxes and you don't do it,
[01:13:19.080 --> 01:13:22.080]   of course you're not doing your job.
[01:13:22.080 --> 01:13:24.080]   The CFO would be fired.
[01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:26.080]   I'm just mad that I didn't think of it.
[01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:28.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:29.080]   The Twitcottage--
[01:13:29.080 --> 01:13:30.080]   Do it.
[01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:31.080]   Permuda.
[01:13:31.080 --> 01:13:32.080]   It's open soon.
[01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:33.080]   Just as long as we're not in short sleep,
[01:13:33.080 --> 01:13:34.080]   we don't--
[01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:35.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:13:35.080 --> 01:13:37.080]   All right, we're going to take a break and get our--
[01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:39.080]   there's nothing to say about this, I think.
[01:13:39.080 --> 01:13:41.080]   It's just-- it's the-- you can't say it's immoral
[01:13:41.080 --> 01:13:44.080]   because it's how the game is played.
[01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:46.080]   It seems reprehensible that corporations are paying 2%.
[01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:50.080]   Taxes when we as individuals are paying far more than that,
[01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:53.080]   but we just don't have the availability.
[01:13:53.080 --> 01:13:58.080]   We don't have the Dutch double Irish sandwich, if only.
[01:13:58.080 --> 01:13:59.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:13:59.080 --> 01:14:00.080]   We're going to get to our--
[01:14:00.080 --> 01:14:01.080]   I'm getting hungry.
[01:14:01.080 --> 01:14:02.080]   I know.
[01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:04.080]   We're going to get to our tip and tool.
[01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:07.080]   And a number of the week, if Jeff comes up with one,
[01:14:07.080 --> 01:14:09.080]   I left you one in the rundown.
[01:14:09.080 --> 01:14:10.080]   There's a number left in there.
[01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:11.080]   There's some--
[01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:12.080]   I've got one too.
[01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:13.080]   --ciding away.
[01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:14.080]   Well, it's for you.
[01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:15.080]   Oh, you got one.
[01:14:15.080 --> 01:14:17.080]   OK, I don't have to leave you one then.
[01:14:17.080 --> 01:14:18.080]   Five million.
[01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:20.080]   That's what-- five million to billion.
[01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:21.080]   Don't say.
[01:14:21.080 --> 01:14:22.080]   Don't say.
[01:14:22.080 --> 01:14:24.080]   Just checking.
[01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:26.080]   This show brought to you by our friends at hover.com.
[01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:28.080]   It's domain, registration, done right.
[01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:31.080]   Hover makes managing domains easy.
[01:14:31.080 --> 01:14:34.080]   Easy to set up email addresses, forward email addresses,
[01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:36.080]   redirect your domains to other website addresses,
[01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:38.080]   all with automated tools.
[01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:41.080]   You can create URL extensions, set privacy controls,
[01:14:41.080 --> 01:14:44.080]   all with fewer clicks and best of all, as far as I'm concerned without.
[01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:47.080]   Hover trying to sell you something you don't want.
[01:14:47.080 --> 01:14:49.080]   If you try to buy a domain from those other guys,
[01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:51.080]   80 clicks later and you're still going,
[01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:55.080]   when's the-- when do I get the domain?
[01:14:55.080 --> 01:14:57.080]   Try Hover's domain management service out.
[01:14:57.080 --> 01:15:00.080]   It's easy to transfer your existing domains to hover.
[01:15:00.080 --> 01:15:01.080]   I wish I'd done that.
[01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:04.080]   You know, I was going to do-- I did it by hand and I got them locked
[01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:06.080]   and I'm having all sorts of trouble, not because of hover
[01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:08.080]   because of the other guys that I'm with,
[01:15:08.080 --> 01:15:11.080]   who will take every opportunity to keep you from moving.
[01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:14.080]   I could have paid Hover $25 to move all of our domains.
[01:15:14.080 --> 01:15:19.080]   No matter, from one to $5,000, you know, 25 bucks, I should have done.
[01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:22.080]   Hover is domain registration done right, simple, easy,
[01:15:22.080 --> 01:15:24.080]   and I want you to try it right now.
[01:15:24.080 --> 01:15:27.080]   You'll even save money if you use our special domain name,
[01:15:27.080 --> 01:15:33.080]   twig.hover.com, twig.hover.com.
[01:15:33.080 --> 01:15:34.080]   Hover doesn't sell a lot of services.
[01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:38.080]   They just make it easy to register and maintain domains and email addresses.
[01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:41.080]   They are great in customer service, no-hold policy for all calls,
[01:15:41.080 --> 01:15:44.080]   Monday through Friday 9/8pm Eastern during business hours.
[01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:48.080]   Simple to transfer.
[01:15:48.080 --> 01:15:55.080]   In fact, this is a special offer for you.
[01:15:55.080 --> 01:15:57.080]   I think.
[01:15:57.080 --> 01:15:58.080]   Do I have it right here in front of me?
[01:15:58.080 --> 01:16:03.080]   10% off your new domain when you go to twig.hover.com.
[01:16:03.080 --> 01:16:07.080]   Hover gives who is privacy free, other guys charge for it.
[01:16:07.080 --> 01:16:12.080]   You're going to spend less with hover because you don't have to pay for privacy.
[01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:15.080]   I always buy domain privacy.
[01:16:15.080 --> 01:16:16.080]   It's free.
[01:16:16.080 --> 01:16:18.080]   It comes along with the deal at hover.
[01:16:18.080 --> 01:16:19.080]   Hover.com.
[01:16:19.080 --> 01:16:26.080]   Use twig.hover.com and the show code twig for saving 10% for your new domain.
[01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:28.080]   I like hover.
[01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:29.080]   All right.
[01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:33.080]   Time for Gina Tarpani's Tip of the Week, Gina.
[01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:34.080]   I got two today.
[01:16:34.080 --> 01:16:36.080]   The first ones are really quick one.
[01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:37.080]   It's really cool.
[01:16:37.080 --> 01:16:38.080]   It's new to me.
[01:16:38.080 --> 01:16:39.080]   I'm not sure how long it's been around.
[01:16:39.080 --> 01:16:51.080]   It's when you're watching YouTube videos, when you hit the play button, you can skip to 10% into the video, 20% into the video, 30% in the video by tapping the one, two, three or four buttons, just the numbers.
[01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:52.080]   Yeah.
[01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:54.080]   And to skip back to the beginning, you just hit zero.
[01:16:54.080 --> 01:16:57.080]   It's like the 30 second skip button on Tivo, but for YouTube.
[01:16:57.080 --> 01:17:02.080]   So it works anywhere, whether the video is embedded somewhere or if it's on actual YouTube.
[01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:04.080]   That is cool.
[01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:05.080]   Yeah, it's pretty cool.
[01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:08.080]   So you can skip through a video pretty quickly to get to the part that you want.
[01:17:08.080 --> 01:17:10.080]   I wish I'd known about that.
[01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:12.080]   We're always trying to jump ahead in videos.
[01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:14.080]   Boy, that would have been saving me a lot of time.
[01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:15.080]   One, two, three, four.
[01:17:15.080 --> 01:17:19.080]   Yeah, just skip ahead and a 10% in the video.
[01:17:19.080 --> 01:17:21.080]   The only thing is the seek bar has to have focus, right?
[01:17:21.080 --> 01:17:25.080]   So you should have just, you click play and then you hit the one and it'll skip.
[01:17:25.080 --> 01:17:27.080]   But if anything else on the page has focus, it doesn't work.
[01:17:27.080 --> 01:17:28.080]   Right.
[01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:29.080]   That makes sense.
[01:17:29.080 --> 01:17:32.080]   The second tip is this really cool Google Suggest mashup.
[01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:34.080]   It's a Venn diagram, right?
[01:17:34.080 --> 01:17:37.080]   So the people at Technomancy made this.
[01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:38.080]   So it's really cool.
[01:17:38.080 --> 01:17:40.080]   So you create this, you write this base query.
[01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:47.080]   That's something like, how do I get my X, like the letter X to?
[01:17:47.080 --> 01:17:49.080]   And then you fill in a few different options.
[01:17:49.080 --> 01:17:50.080]   So you can say, how do I get my X to?
[01:17:50.080 --> 01:17:53.080]   And you fill in cat, dog, husband.
[01:17:53.080 --> 01:18:02.080]   And you click update and it creates a Venn diagram of all of Google Suggests auto completions for those three queries.
[01:18:02.080 --> 01:18:08.080]   So the Venn diagram for this query that I ran, how do I get my X to, you know, cat, dog, husband.
[01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:12.080]   It's like, lose weight is the middle of Venn diagram for everybody.
[01:18:12.080 --> 01:18:14.080]   Love me, for water.
[01:18:14.080 --> 01:18:17.080]   Stop biting, clean the house.
[01:18:17.080 --> 01:18:19.080]   Cheat, fall in love with me again.
[01:18:19.080 --> 01:18:20.080]   And it's really kind of fun.
[01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:21.080]   This is great.
[01:18:21.080 --> 01:18:24.080]   Yeah, it's a really kind of clever, cool mashup.
[01:18:24.080 --> 01:18:27.080]   And people kind of put in all kinds of values for men.
[01:18:27.080 --> 01:18:30.080]   So if we did X is, and you put in each of our names.
[01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:35.080]   So why is Twig so?
[01:18:35.080 --> 01:18:37.080]   And then I put in.
[01:18:37.080 --> 01:18:38.080]   Well, you have to have an X.
[01:18:38.080 --> 01:18:40.080]   So you have to have an X that fills in.
[01:18:40.080 --> 01:18:42.080]   So yeah, you can say like X is.
[01:18:42.080 --> 01:18:46.080]   Why is, let's see.
[01:18:46.080 --> 01:18:49.080]   X is weird.
[01:18:49.080 --> 01:18:51.080]   I don't know.
[01:18:51.080 --> 01:18:52.080]   What would I put in here?
[01:18:52.080 --> 01:18:53.080]   And then I do.
[01:18:53.080 --> 01:18:55.080]   You could just say X is and then put.
[01:18:55.080 --> 01:18:56.080]   Okay.
[01:18:56.080 --> 01:18:57.080]   And Gina, Jeff and Leo.
[01:18:57.080 --> 01:18:58.080]   Yeah.
[01:18:58.080 --> 01:18:59.080]   All right.
[01:18:59.080 --> 01:19:00.080]   So that's it.
[01:19:00.080 --> 01:19:01.080]   I don't know what we're going to get.
[01:19:01.080 --> 01:19:02.080]   So we press up to eight.
[01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:04.080]   This is just going to be weird.
[01:19:04.080 --> 01:19:05.080]   I don't know.
[01:19:05.080 --> 01:19:08.080]   Or is it done?
[01:19:08.080 --> 01:19:09.080]   Sorry, you can see.
[01:19:09.080 --> 01:19:10.080]   I'm sure.
[01:19:10.080 --> 01:19:12.080]   I'm a late runner, apparently.
[01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:13.080]   I don't know.
[01:19:13.080 --> 01:19:14.080]   Gina is a punk rocker.
[01:19:14.080 --> 01:19:16.080]   AAC, awesome.
[01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:17.080]   I have a.
[01:19:17.080 --> 01:19:18.080]   I know.
[01:19:18.080 --> 01:19:21.080]   I rail is like the intersection of Gina and Jeff is rail.
[01:19:21.080 --> 01:19:24.080]   I have an idiot between.
[01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:27.080]   Between Jeff and Leo and.
[01:19:27.080 --> 01:19:28.080]   That's good.
[01:19:28.080 --> 01:19:29.080]   I like that.
[01:19:29.080 --> 01:19:30.080]   That's good.
[01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:32.080]   So you have to kind of play around with it.
[01:19:32.080 --> 01:19:34.080]   It doesn't give you instant.
[01:19:34.080 --> 01:19:36.080]   You have to come up with some good queries.
[01:19:36.080 --> 01:19:39.080]   In fact, the link in the friend feed gives some good examples.
[01:19:39.080 --> 01:19:41.080]   Yeah, they did on hacker news.
[01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:43.080]   They came up with a bunch of good stuff.
[01:19:43.080 --> 01:19:45.080]   Why is America Canada your so?
[01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:46.080]   Yeah.
[01:19:46.080 --> 01:19:48.080]   Star Trek Star Wars in Avatar.
[01:19:48.080 --> 01:19:49.080]   No, this is good.
[01:19:49.080 --> 01:19:52.080]   Leo and Jeff combined are an idiot.
[01:19:52.080 --> 01:19:53.080]   That's good.
[01:19:53.080 --> 01:19:54.080]   That's good.
[01:19:54.080 --> 01:19:56.080]   And then Gina, you're completely blank.
[01:19:56.080 --> 01:19:59.080]   So it sort of reveals these generalizations that we make about.
[01:19:59.080 --> 01:20:01.080]   So you can get some really kind of racist stuff.
[01:20:01.080 --> 01:20:03.080]   You can get some fun with that.
[01:20:03.080 --> 01:20:04.080]   But also some kind of funny stuff.
[01:20:04.080 --> 01:20:09.080]   It works really well for sort of larger queries about religions and people.
[01:20:09.080 --> 01:20:13.080]   And it reveals the most common searches because it suggests.
[01:20:13.080 --> 01:20:18.080]   So a hacker news reader said why is America so?
[01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:22.080]   And then you put in, actually I could actually go to that search I think.
[01:20:22.080 --> 01:20:24.080]   And so why is America so?
[01:20:24.080 --> 01:20:29.080]   Because you use Canada, America and Europe and then Canada, bad at soccer, boring, cold, lame,
[01:20:29.080 --> 01:20:32.080]   multicultural, peaceful, sparsely populated.
[01:20:32.080 --> 01:20:37.080]   America, conservative, fat, obese, religious, stupid, violent.
[01:20:37.080 --> 01:20:42.080]   And then when you combine America with Canada, you get awesome, great, but you combine America
[01:20:42.080 --> 01:20:45.080]   with Europe, you get racist and rich.
[01:20:45.080 --> 01:20:46.080]   And this is really bizarre.
[01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:49.080]   I don't even know what it means, Gina, but it's a toy.
[01:20:49.080 --> 01:20:50.080]   It's kind of fascinating.
[01:20:50.080 --> 01:20:51.080]   Yeah.
[01:20:51.080 --> 01:20:52.080]   Yeah.
[01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:54.080]   And it's like a charting of groupthink.
[01:20:54.080 --> 01:20:57.080]   I guess it is because it's using the search results.
[01:20:57.080 --> 01:20:58.080]   Right.
[01:20:58.080 --> 01:20:59.080]   Right.
[01:20:59.080 --> 01:21:00.080]   So I had to try that a lot.
[01:21:00.080 --> 01:21:06.080]   So it's two scientists who a week ago predicted stock market performance based on Twitter's
[01:21:06.080 --> 01:21:07.080]   mood.
[01:21:07.080 --> 01:21:08.080]   Yeah.
[01:21:08.080 --> 01:21:09.080]   They were very...
[01:21:09.080 --> 01:21:10.080]   They were very...
[01:21:10.080 --> 01:21:11.080]   We just don't know what it is.
[01:21:11.080 --> 01:21:12.080]   Yeah.
[01:21:12.080 --> 01:21:13.080]   They could tell something.
[01:21:13.080 --> 01:21:14.080]   Yeah.
[01:21:14.080 --> 01:21:15.080]   Your number of the week, Mr. J.
[01:21:15.080 --> 01:21:17.080]   Five million, two billion.
[01:21:17.080 --> 01:21:22.000]   The two billion is that Google reportedly is going to buy its gigantic New York building
[01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.000]   which is a complete city block.
[01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:28.320]   The former Port Authority building where they have all this wonderful open space and a slide
[01:21:28.320 --> 01:21:29.320]   and all kinds of stuff.
[01:21:29.320 --> 01:21:30.320]   Are there people working there?
[01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:31.320]   Yeah.
[01:21:31.320 --> 01:21:32.320]   Oh, yeah.
[01:21:32.320 --> 01:21:33.320]   Oh, yeah.
[01:21:33.320 --> 01:21:34.320]   Oh, that's where they are.
[01:21:34.320 --> 01:21:36.120]   They have all the fiber into there and the redundant power and all the stuff they need.
[01:21:36.120 --> 01:21:37.120]   So they're just going to buy it.
[01:21:37.120 --> 01:21:38.280]   Not a big deal.
[01:21:38.280 --> 01:21:42.640]   And then the five million is that Google just gave five million dollars to the Knight Foundation.
[01:21:42.640 --> 01:21:47.520]   Two million of which will be used to fund US journalism efforts.
[01:21:47.520 --> 01:21:51.920]   Three million will be used for foreign efforts for a partner to be named.
[01:21:51.920 --> 01:21:56.600]   This means that Google can give to Knight as kind of a Switzerland that will deal with
[01:21:56.600 --> 01:22:01.680]   this rather than giving to, oh, I don't know, directly to schools like mine.
[01:22:01.680 --> 01:22:03.440]   Seems like that's not a lot of money.
[01:22:03.440 --> 01:22:08.280]   No, but it's a little bit of a spent on innovation and journalism that actually is something.
[01:22:08.280 --> 01:22:09.280]   It's something.
[01:22:09.280 --> 01:22:10.480]   It's better than nothing.
[01:22:10.480 --> 01:22:11.480]   Yeah.
[01:22:11.480 --> 01:22:16.800]   My tool of the week is, I don't know, do I credit you Eileen for Map Crunch?
[01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:18.240]   Did you find this one?
[01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:20.000]   Or did Gina find this one?
[01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:21.680]   Gina and you both marked it.
[01:22:21.680 --> 01:22:22.680]   Yeah, we both put it in there.
[01:22:22.680 --> 01:22:23.680]   It's kind of cool.
[01:22:23.680 --> 01:22:25.960]   Mapcrunch.com.
[01:22:25.960 --> 01:22:29.600]   It's kind of chat roulette for Street View.
[01:22:29.600 --> 01:22:33.240]   So you could choose a location and click go.
[01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:37.080]   You could say, I want a slide show.
[01:22:37.080 --> 01:22:39.480]   You can be random or you can pick places.
[01:22:39.480 --> 01:22:42.640]   I was afraid we were going to see naked German standing on those three corners in front
[01:22:42.640 --> 01:22:43.640]   of Pixelated.
[01:22:43.640 --> 01:22:44.640]   You could.
[01:22:44.640 --> 01:22:45.960]   Oh, look, I don't know where are we now?
[01:22:45.960 --> 01:22:48.160]   We're in Antarctica or somewhere.
[01:22:48.160 --> 01:22:49.160]   So it's amazing, really.
[01:22:49.160 --> 01:22:52.640]   Street View has so many images that you could just basically go in there.
[01:22:52.640 --> 01:22:53.640]   There's Georgia.
[01:22:53.640 --> 01:22:56.160]   A road, a country road.
[01:22:56.160 --> 01:23:00.080]   So if you don't get to travel much, but you'd like to see what's out there, just go to
[01:23:00.080 --> 01:23:03.520]   mapcrunch.com and you can get to county road 104.
[01:23:03.520 --> 01:23:07.840]   I'm waiting for some travel blogger to kind of comp, but there's random itinerary using
[01:23:07.840 --> 01:23:10.560]   this app and then go and take the picture again or something.
[01:23:10.560 --> 01:23:11.640]   Oh, wouldn't that be cool?
[01:23:11.640 --> 01:23:13.320]   With like a no-minute or something.
[01:23:13.320 --> 01:23:14.320]   Where's that?
[01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:15.320]   That's a Santa Fe.
[01:23:15.320 --> 01:23:16.320]   That's near Santa Fe.
[01:23:16.320 --> 01:23:17.480]   We're in New Mexico.
[01:23:17.480 --> 01:23:19.880]   I think they may have picked some of the nicer photos.
[01:23:19.880 --> 01:23:20.880]   You think they did?
[01:23:20.880 --> 01:23:23.440]   They kind of doing, yeah, because it's like, well, think about that.
[01:23:23.440 --> 01:23:25.400]   There's a lot of countryside in the world.
[01:23:25.400 --> 01:23:26.960]   Yeah, that's true.
[01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:29.520]   This poor Google Street View has got to drive all over the place.
[01:23:29.520 --> 01:23:31.000]   I think that's Kentucky.
[01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:34.600]   This is kind of a mapcrunch.com.
[01:23:34.600 --> 01:23:37.120]   I'm just, what am I producing shows for?
[01:23:37.120 --> 01:23:38.920]   I could just turn this on.
[01:23:38.920 --> 01:23:40.440]   Let it go.
[01:23:40.440 --> 01:23:42.040]   Watch the world go by.
[01:23:42.040 --> 01:23:47.320]   If you ever played with the flicker, not awesome, this world, what's it called?
[01:23:47.320 --> 01:23:48.320]   Interestingness.
[01:23:48.320 --> 01:23:49.320]   It's interestingness.
[01:23:49.320 --> 01:23:50.320]   Yes.
[01:23:50.320 --> 01:23:51.320]   It's amazing.
[01:23:51.320 --> 01:23:52.320]   Yeah, it's amazing.
[01:23:52.320 --> 01:23:53.320]   Boy, it is mesmerizing.
[01:23:53.320 --> 01:23:54.320]   Yeah.
[01:23:54.320 --> 01:23:55.320]   It is.
[01:23:55.320 --> 01:23:56.680]   So many good photographers out there.
[01:23:56.680 --> 01:23:57.960]   Well, that's it for the show.
[01:23:57.960 --> 01:24:03.760]   Hey, I really want to thank our poor guest, Mitch Wagner, for joining us.
[01:24:03.760 --> 01:24:04.760]   It was great.
[01:24:04.760 --> 01:24:05.960]   Hope you enjoyed it.
[01:24:05.960 --> 01:24:07.760]   We thank you for being here.
[01:24:07.760 --> 01:24:11.280]   Follow them on Twitter, Mitch Wagner at twitter.com.
[01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:16.960]   Always unusual when you join Gina and Jeff and me because you never know what we're
[01:24:16.960 --> 01:24:17.960]   going to be talking about.
[01:24:17.960 --> 01:24:20.400]   We should have warned you we would talk about Glee and Mad Men.
[01:24:20.400 --> 01:24:21.400]   I didn't know my song.
[01:24:21.400 --> 01:24:22.400]   Well, my favorite subject.
[01:24:22.400 --> 01:24:23.400]   So it's all right.
[01:24:23.400 --> 01:24:24.400]   There you go.
[01:24:24.400 --> 01:24:25.400]   You can't go wrong with that.
[01:24:25.400 --> 01:24:27.240]   Gina Tarpani is at smarterwear.org.
[01:24:27.240 --> 01:24:32.600]   You can also follow her on Fast Company, Fast Company.com/worksmart for her new series.
[01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:33.800]   That's pretty cool.
[01:24:33.800 --> 01:24:35.560]   And Jeff Jarvis is tenured.
[01:24:35.560 --> 01:24:38.640]   So you can't do anything to him.
[01:24:38.640 --> 01:24:43.120]   He's at the City University of New York where he teaches journalism to youngsters who are
[01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:44.720]   entering a brave new world.
[01:24:44.720 --> 01:24:46.600]   He's also a blogger at buzzmachine.com.
[01:24:46.600 --> 01:24:52.080]   And his book is What Would Google Do New Books Soon To Emerge Public Parts?
[01:24:52.080 --> 01:24:53.640]   Do we know when that's going to come out yet?
[01:24:53.640 --> 01:24:56.200]   Hey, do we know it's going to be finished?
[01:24:56.200 --> 01:24:57.200]   No we don't.
[01:24:57.200 --> 01:24:58.200]   We do not.
[01:24:58.200 --> 01:24:59.200]   No, we don't.
[01:24:59.200 --> 01:25:00.200]   I'm working away.
[01:25:00.200 --> 01:25:01.200]   You probably get that call once in a while from your public.
[01:25:01.200 --> 01:25:02.200]   It's long on the way.
[01:25:02.200 --> 01:25:03.200]   I'll walk so you can't.
[01:25:03.200 --> 01:25:04.200]   I'll walk so you can't.
[01:25:04.200 --> 01:25:05.200]   I'll walk so you can't.

[01:25:25.200 --> 01:25:26.200]   I'll walk so you can't.
[01:25:26.200 --> 01:25:27.200]   I'll walk so you can't.
[01:25:27.200 --> 01:25:28.200]   I'll walk so you can't.
[01:25:28.200 --> 01:25:29.200]   I'll walk so you can't.
[01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:30.200]   I'll walk so you can't.
