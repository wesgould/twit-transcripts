[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:54.000]   We will have a show next week. December 29th. It'll be our best of twig
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.080]   Some great moments. That's that's one of the shows
[00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:02.080]   It's really the best I was gonna be great because there's so many silly things and fun things that happen throughout the year
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.480]   So make sure you
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.200]   Download that and then we'll be back a week two weeks from today
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.800]   Which is January 5th with an all-new episode and of course is on vacation
[00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.480]   He tells us he's binge watching succession even as we speak
[00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.720]   So good for you. We actually had a discussion before the show. What is it a binge? What is a binge?
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.760]   He's watched too. It sounds like is that a binge?
[00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:31.240]   But he says he doesn't binge watch he doesn't binge watch it. That's what it was. Oh, it doesn't but he's watched too
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.960]   Does not binge watch so according to him
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:41.120]   That's under the binge threshold thus under the binge threshold
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:46.760]   I think we have a show title before we've even begun
[00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:55.480]   So it looks like CES is it's still on it's two weeks from now January 5th
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.960]   It's still on but boy
[00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.760]   Be lonely and shaky. It's gonna be quiet. So I
[00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:12.000]   Just canceled my stuff not that I'm not going to drop but you're not going to the I'm not going
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.320]   Well, you know what I'm relieved. I was worried about your Stacy. I'm actually honestly earnestly relieved
[00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:21.400]   I'm glad you're not going. I was less worried about me. I just feel like
[00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.800]   You know, what if I caught it and brought it to somebody who didn't need to get it my
[00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:31.240]   Like it just it felt irresponsible. It seems like that timing if they've been a month later
[00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.680]   Maybe it wouldn't be a you know what crime would have burned through
[00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:39.000]   I have a feeling it's gonna be like that where there's this big surge then everybody gets it
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.680]   And then it goes on and burns itself out anyway Amazon isn't going
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:49.480]   Meta is not going. These are the announcements Pinterest is not going Twitter is not going
[00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:51.080]   the
[00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.520]   Announcements by the companies are shortly followed by announcements from
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:59.280]   CNET and the verge and gizmodo. They're not gonna go then in that case. I'm not going
[00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:02.960]   Ant's not going cuz we told him he couldn't and
[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:10.720]   For you protecting aunt. Well, yeah, and yeah, and his family and us and I just I know we wanted to but
[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:15.000]   I does want to and I don't blame him, but this is not gonna be wanted to it's just
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.880]   It's not gonna be any fun either. I mean and by fun
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:24.100]   I mean like it's not gonna be professionally all that useful. It doesn't sound like see yes
[00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:26.320]   Hardware guys have they they canceled or
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:29.600]   HP has not as of yet
[00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:34.160]   This you mean the big TV companies cuz they're yeah, those kind of same thing LG
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.880]   I think they're all going I would bet they're probably there all their stuff is already there
[00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:41.560]   That's right. They should it a lot of them. We're sending
[00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:50.840]   Smaller teams or only their us based teams was what I got from a lot of people in China and Europe here from the verge
[00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:53.560]   Is a picture of the sad balloon that is
[00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:01.240]   Was like it's in a bad boat. Oh, it's raining in a parking lot
[00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:10.880]   CES itself says no we're no we're still going in fact
[00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:16.520]   More people signed up after those stupid 40 companies quit
[00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:21.360]   We got 60 new exhibitors so there
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:26.600]   CES will be in person January 5th through 8th. This is the statement from
[00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:32.600]   Gene Foster head of marketing and communications from the consumer technology says the sponsors. Yeah
[00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:35.640]   Was it hard to cancel your stuff Stacy?
[00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:38.720]   No, I mean I I
[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:45.760]   Wasn't I just called and I had to call my hotel and that's where Google's hold for me really came in handy. Oh
[00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:53.400]   Yeah, you just said what oh yeah, cuz I bet they were quite busy see yeah, they were super cuz you you couldn't cancel online
[00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:55.400]   You had to call
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:08:01.960]   CES will be on in person says gene January 5th through 8th in Las Vegas with strong
[00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:04.640]   safety measures in place and
[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:11.680]   Digital access is also available for people that don't wish to or can't travel to Las Vegas our mission remains to convene the industry and give
[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:16.120]   Those who can attend in person the ability to experience the magic of CES digitally
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:18.960]   while we received
[00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:25.040]   While you're eating it you're gonna get a hammer to smash the bottom of your feet so it feels like you're going to see yes
[00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:30.520]   There you go virtual CES kit while we recently received 42
[00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:34.960]   exhibitor cancellations less than 7% of our exhibit floor lessons last Thursday
[00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:38.320]   We've added 60 new exhibitors for our in-person event
[00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:46.200]   registrations for both digital access and Las Vegas event. Oh interesting they mix those together are showing strong momentum
[00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:49.480]   With thousands more registrations in the last few days
[00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:55.000]   So they you know they're saying we're gonna we're gonna do it safely vaccination requirement
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:58.720]   Masking COVID-19 tests combined with lower
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:01.640]   You can't issue two tests you I got an email like
[00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:09.720]   Middle of last week right after we did the show saying hey, we're gonna send out two tests when you get there so
[00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:16.360]   It does remind me a little bit of mobile world Congress 2020 remember where they kept saying doggedly no we're going no
[00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:18.360]   We're going and they finally said no we're not
[00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:20.360]   But it is you know
[00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:22.360]   Gosh it has to be a big
[00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:27.160]   Loss, I don't know what kind of insurance they were able to get after last time. Yeah, that's the problem
[00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:31.440]   But it's a big deal, you know you have to you buy up a hotel rooms ahead of time
[00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:37.080]   So they can charge exorbitant rates to the what was the one with South by Southwest didn't have insurance
[00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:39.080]   I remember we're talking about that that time
[00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:41.080]   Somebody did have a choice
[00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:47.120]   But they did not have insurance right we were we talked about the time there was some other conference
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:51.220]   Right there were some conference that did have it right I can't remember who it was it was smart
[00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:55.240]   Yeah, that really almost put South by out of business
[00:09:55.240 --> 00:10:00.240]   I think they had to get a white knight to come in and save them so they had a buyer come in and buy them. Yeah
[00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:03.240]   Yeah, yeah
[00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:07.160]   Meanwhile the rich get richer right, you know
[00:10:07.160 --> 00:10:13.080]   What are you gonna say I was like where'd that come from?
[00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:21.320]   Actually from because you're anti-capitalist ramp there Monday Monday we did our holiday special and you know
[00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:28.280]   I can't remember what the number was but the the richest people in America got much richer during COVID. Oh, yeah
[00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:30.920]   600% or something it was huge growth
[00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:32.560]   so
[00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:33.640]   while
[00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:40.680]   You know CES in South by practically face bankruptcy people are out of work businesses go out down, you know
[00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:42.680]   Main Street USA is gutted
[00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:47.600]   Amazon, you know, it's doing pretty good Jeff Bezos to let us let us Flint
[00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:51.440]   Neil Neil let us have a moment of silence for Elon Musk's tax bill
[00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:53.000]   11 whining
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.560]   Billion dollars and he's so mad about it. Oh, he's so on dude
[00:10:56.560 --> 00:11:02.200]   You're the richest man in the world the richest man ever worth more than 270 billion dollars
[00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:07.600]   And you're bitching because you have to pay taxes pay your damn taxes
[00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:11.080]   You know what I pay more taxes than he does
[00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:15.600]   Based on like per capita and you know, you don't see me complaining
[00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:19.840]   Let's talk. Let's talk weird tweets. Shall we?
[00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:26.360]   We are we going with Dorsey? We're going with Dorsey. We're going with so much fun
[00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:32.160]   He's having such a good time now. So now that he's not the head of Twitter. He's tweeting
[00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:40.040]   And a good tweet I thought that he put out yesterday. You don't own web 3 web 3 is all the rage these days
[00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:46.160]   Everybody's talking about this decentralized blockchain based world wide web. You don't own that he says
[00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:54.000]   The VC's and their LPs limited partners do it will never escape their incentives. It's ultimately a
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:12:04.160]   Centralized entity with a different label know what you're getting into of course the promise among all the web 3 advocates is that it isn't
[00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:07.280]   centralized it is completely decentralized and
[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:11.160]   You know
[00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:16.000]   He's his point in fact. I think he he had a kind of in all of his replies
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:22.800]   He kind of implied this his point is it's really a buzzword created by and recent Horowitz
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:29.800]   And that's the VC's he's talking about and their limited partners are all their investments that he's talking about
[00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:32.480]   He says this is they really own it
[00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:38.160]   Yeah, I did have in the thread and I screwed it up. Yeah, I
[00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:41.280]   Was yeah, there was such a long thread
[00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:47.720]   I'm not gonna find it because a lot of people responded to him a lot of people called him crazy mostly the web 3
[00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:50.960]   advocates the bros absolutely yeah
[00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:58.640]   VC's congratulating themselves VC at VC brags tweeted how dare you question the integrity of VC's
[00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:06.600]   And and you know you've taken a lot of VC money
[00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:11.240]   So I don't know what you mean says Adam art to which jacks says this is why I know exactly what I mean
[00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:19.440]   Now he's out of it. He can he can say this so I you know, I'm not gonna weigh in on this. It's just right now
[00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:22.440]   It's it's just a catchphrase anyway
[00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:25.240]   Well the beauty is when jacks
[00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:32.200]   tweeted that he was banned from web 3 yeah, so and mark mark and recent who of course is one of the principles at
[00:13:32.200 --> 00:13:37.600]   Andreessen Horowitz. He was the guy who made all the money on that scape became a venture capitalist
[00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:40.200]   He immediately blocked
[00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:46.960]   Jack Dorsey how dare you question Jack is like so so
[00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:50.120]   Block happy
[00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:57.960]   Yeah, I got blocked like two years ago. I have no idea what I did wrong. I've never criticized him never had caused
[00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:02.800]   I know I've never criticized the company. I don't know what I did. I've been blocked for a long time before Jack
[00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:04.880]   Well
[00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:07.280]   Okay, I in his defense and there's no reason to defend him
[00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:13.280]   But in his defense that's the best way to use Twitter is to immediately block people you don't want to hear from
[00:14:13.280 --> 00:14:15.840]   right
[00:14:15.840 --> 00:14:21.080]   Yes, but I would say the reasons he blocks people are not the I mean
[00:14:21.080 --> 00:14:26.160]   He's got either the thinnest skin in the world or he's just like well. He just doesn't need it
[00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:28.160]   He doesn't want the noise. I honestly
[00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:35.000]   That's kind of my motto with Twitter is follow freely and block justice freely even more freely
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:41.080]   I block happily if someone's insulting me, but I don't block maybe not a lock maybe just unfunded disagree
[00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:42.440]   Yeah, yeah
[00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:47.640]   Well some people this person has a different take I should probably I mean I'll at least read it and see yeah
[00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:50.320]   some people want
[00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:55.640]   To hear the other side most people don't most people just they want to you know
[00:14:55.640 --> 00:15:00.040]   I kind of feel like it's my job. Yeah. Yeah, that's different. Yeah, you're different. Yeah
[00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:06.080]   You know I if mark and reason doesn't want to hear criticisms of web 3 fine
[00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:15.600]   I know yeah, that's certainly his right, but yeah, but you lose out on some interesting fun and and and challenges that are worthwhile sometimes right
[00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:18.600]   Come back. I miss you
[00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:22.800]   Do we miss Jack at Twitter? I don't think we do I
[00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:25.960]   Don't think this Jack mr. No, yeah
[00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:30.920]   Jack has not lost his enthusiasm for Bitcoin. However
[00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:36.680]   He he does say Bitcoin is gonna replace the u.s. Dollar someday
[00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:43.000]   This is in another another tweet tweet exchange with Cardi B
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:46.360]   who is of course as everyone knows a world famous economist and
[00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:49.360]   Rapstar
[00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:53.960]   Cardi asked on Twitter of crypto or replace the u.s. Currency
[00:15:53.960 --> 00:16:00.400]   To which Dorsey replied yes Bitcoin will
[00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:05.600]   There you go. I love how worlds come together. Yeah
[00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:12.560]   That's Twitter right there for you right there Twitter in a nutshell Cardi B and Jack Dorsey back and forth
[00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:16.920]   Talking about crypto. There's nothing more Twitter than that
[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:25.320]   Dogecoin co-founder Billy Marcus in response posted a meme about how dogecoin is more stable than the u.s. Dollar
[00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:32.160]   What does coin to be the
[00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:36.320]   Fiat yeah, you know yeah, I don't
[00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:44.360]   Boy that's all of our stories. Thank you so much for joining us. This is gonna be a slow
[00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:46.360]   This is gonna be a very this
[00:16:47.880 --> 00:16:52.800]   Nothing is going on did we I think we already maybe this was on a twit
[00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:56.640]   That's right because Jeff was here talked about some kind of confusing you because you think
[00:16:56.640 --> 00:17:02.200]   Jarvis we were talking about read it looks like gonna go
[00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:04.680]   Do an IPO
[00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:09.320]   And we talked a little bit about reddit on on Sunday on the Twitter
[00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:15.160]   I think my red is my favorite social network and I the reason I like it is because
[00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:21.520]   You very much in control of what you see you follow subject matter not people you could follow people
[00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:27.800]   But I don't I think most people just use it by following subreddits and then and what I like about it as as my enthusiasm
[00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:33.960]   Shift which they do rapidly I can just shift my reddit to follow the things I'm interested in
[00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:38.120]   It seems like a good way so I've been trying Leo because you said that on Sunday
[00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:44.280]   That you like reddit and I it wasn't using reddit much so I've been trying to more it. I still like Twitter better
[00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:50.200]   Well, Twitter is short, but it's fun for I feel like Twitter is
[00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:57.360]   Maybe a good coffee shop and reddit is like the local bowling alley. Yeah, that's good
[00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:01.600]   Let's let's deconstruct that a bowling
[00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:05.440]   You wear screen shoes
[00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:11.080]   Get sore and I went you're hanging out like a coffee shop
[00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:16.960]   You've got this veneer of the intellectual whatever, but really it's just a coffee shop and people are chatting about their eyes
[00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:23.320]   They're whatever they think they're just kind of focused on they have some pretensions around it, right in the bowling alley
[00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:27.240]   You know you can be ironic, but you're still gonna be pretty unpretentious
[00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:31.200]   Well, and I did mention this I did mention this
[00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:40.920]   That the best part of reddit for me is following the hottest posts and not necessarily reading the comments on those posts
[00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:48.640]   Sometimes I do but the posts themselves are what I follow and that's less of a bowling alley because it's not so much a conversation as
[00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:53.760]   People saying hey, here's a here's something I realized her which is why you like Twitter top articles
[00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:58.600]   It's similar to top articles except its long form instead of being you know 280 characters
[00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:04.480]   It could be and there's often images and you know, it's just more, you know, I follow basically
[00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:06.360]   You know a few
[00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:14.520]   Enthusiasm's like the shows I like the the hardware I like the you know and then news and politics and the COVID
[00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:17.840]   Chat was was really good the COVID-19
[00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:21.720]   I guess I stopped falling it probably should be time to follow it again
[00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:25.720]   I just I like it
[00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:31.800]   Anyway, I think they'll do well. So that's who benefits from that Conde right Conde Nastones. Well, so Conde
[00:19:32.840 --> 00:19:39.640]   I said this on on Twitter, but I'll say it again. I was there or I guess it was yeah
[00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:41.640]   I was there when when
[00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:46.560]   Steve Newhouse my boss loved dig wanted to get in on dig was put for a
[00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:49.240]   fucking beat he tried to get me to get him in on Facebook. I failed him
[00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:56.080]   I failed him on dig but he after I left he he out of nowhere bought reddit because it was kind of the second choice to dig
[00:19:56.080 --> 00:20:00.640]   It was poor man's dig well, I guess who won and he very wisely
[00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:09.520]   Spun it off such that they had equity so that the the owners still felt like owners and employees could feel
[00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:15.880]   A stake and so that they had something to trade with so it wasn't it wasn't you know
[00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:19.480]   Stock market equity, but it was spun off in essence from Conde
[00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:23.560]   But Conde owns the lion share of it so they'll do very very well. He bought it for a song
[00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:26.920]   What do you buy I forgot what he bought it for a couple hundred million
[00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:30.040]   That much even
[00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:32.280]   Let me see here
[00:20:32.440 --> 00:20:34.440]   Oh
[00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:40.200]   Come on tell me this is oh core. That's why it's cause of pain in the butt
[00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:47.480]   Quora results Quora results come up 10 million to 20 million. Oh nothing a song you're right thing
[00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:49.320]   nothing Wow
[00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:53.160]   Dig was even valued at 60 million Wow nothing
[00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:59.640]   What was Kevin Rose when he was on on the cover of business week? It was the 60 million dollar man and Kevin
[00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:03.880]   We used to mock him and he was still at tech tv when that came out and we used to mock him
[00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:06.840]   He said yeah, no, I didn't get any of that 60 million
[00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:09.880]   He's doing our on the other hand. He's doing fine. Yeah
[00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:13.960]   He was an early investor in twitter among other things
[00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:18.520]   Oh nice. Yeah. Yeah. Oh nice nice work if you can get it
[00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:24.680]   I have never gotten anything. My only early investments have been in things that have failed
[00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:27.960]   Pretty much the same here. Yay. I have no
[00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:31.560]   I was going through my own business cards. I have my partner at daylife business cards
[00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:36.840]   I had to hold boxes on partner. They weren't their life. What was I don't even know what that was day life was
[00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:39.560]   a google news as an api
[00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:46.200]   I know the brand sounded like a day spa where you get you know hot stone massages, but it wasn't
[00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:49.960]   Oh, I would like a hot stone massage
[00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:53.480]   I'm like yes, please
[00:21:53.800 --> 00:22:01.160]   Survey says americans widely distrust facebook tiktok and instagram. I know I I believe
[00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:05.800]   I would not be doing this. I would not be doing this story if it weren't for such a slow week
[00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:10.760]   You left it off the rundown just to just run up on I hate to say it's okay
[00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:14.520]   Heather kelly we're waiting for the washington post, but they're quoting a survey from uh
[00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:17.080]   the washington post
[00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:19.160]   char school poll
[00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:25.160]   Many americans use social media and most use facebook but 64 percent say the government
[00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:31.640]   Should do more to reign in big tech companies problem is it's one of those things where it's really easy to get people to say stuff like that
[00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:35.480]   Exactly. Yeah. Yeah, that's a good idea. Good idea
[00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:40.680]   The one question was um, do you depend upon your phone?
[00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:43.640]   Yeah, and
[00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:48.920]   It depended upon the toilet too. What's the problem? What does it mean? It doesn't really know a lot of context
[00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:51.000]   internet users
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:53.400]   Here's the question. How much do you trust?
[00:22:53.400 --> 00:23:02.280]   Each of the following how much do you trust each of the following companies or services to responsibly handle your personal information and data
[00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:07.880]   On your internet activity guard you just you did the setup for that is so obvious
[00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:12.440]   How much do you trust these country companies with your privacy in other words?
[00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:16.440]   And then uh the dark is trust not much at all
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:21.560]   The light blue is trust a great deal a good amount and the gray is no opinion
[00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:24.520]   Facebook came out worse. Amazon people are not wrong
[00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:29.000]   They they trust amazons number one they trust
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.200]   Yeah
[00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:34.520]   More than half trust and I think it's you do trust them you trust them with your data
[00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:37.880]   You don't trust them to necessarily do right by the merchants trying to sell you stuff
[00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:42.520]   But amazons they your data goes in it never comes back out. I guess that's true
[00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:46.120]   Apple is actually behind amazon by a goodly amount
[00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:49.320]   Then mike how much you how much data do you really give apple?
[00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:55.240]   Versus amazon well potentially everything because you carry their phone around so well
[00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:58.840]   Potentially if they wanted it they could get a lot of information
[00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:04.360]   Historically they are uh, they don't try to get everything and and of course they make a lot of
[00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:11.160]   Uh do a lot of marketing and spend a lot of marketing. There's a feature. Yeah. Yeah saying hey, you know, we're safe
[00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:16.280]   Um, 43 trust microsoft just slightly under apple
[00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:23.800]   Google is actually doing fairly well 48 trust them a great deal 35 trust
[00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:25.960]   youtube
[00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:27.400]   15
[00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:33.080]   For what's app 19 for instagram 12 for tick tock tucks the least trusted
[00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:36.920]   I'm sorry though. They want sap was a huge. I don't know
[00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:42.200]   Yeah, a lot of I don't know in what's app that's the third said I don't know the same with tick tock
[00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:45.960]   Yeah, I don't know. I don't know why should I trust them. I don't know. I don't know who they are
[00:24:46.600 --> 00:24:54.680]   Uh, you know, it's it's because of the large and shifting. I don't know percentage. You can't really it's kind of weird because
[00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:59.800]   For instance youtube is trusted by 35 of people
[00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:04.840]   But mistrusted by 53 which is a fairly hefty proportion
[00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:11.240]   So it's a little it's a little confusing. It's it's I mean I I often quoted these moments
[00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:15.800]   The brilliant James Kerry the late professor from clove university who said the pinyon polls
[00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:21.080]   preempt the public conversation they're meant to measure. Yeah, what we have here is is the case of
[00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:26.040]   Self-fulfilling prophecy from media, right three billion people still use facebook
[00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:32.280]   But the media are beating everybody over the head. Yeah, it's awful. It's evil and terrible. Do you think they're awful and evil and probable? Yes
[00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:38.280]   Oh, it's almost a measure of you know, have you been reading our stories more than exactly exactly? Yeah
[00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:42.520]   um, most say there's something going on here. I'm not denying that but it's just
[00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:45.960]   the media never acknowledge
[00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:48.200]   their own
[00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:51.080]   Self-reflective impact and by the way conflict of interest
[00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:55.080]   Most say targeted ads are annoying invasive and not helpful
[00:25:55.080 --> 00:26:00.920]   This is very counterintuitive 82 percent say people say targeted ads are
[00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:05.800]   Annoying invasive and not helpful. I don't understand that
[00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:08.760]   Because I think it's people who give up said by
[00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:16.360]   Well, no, I also think people get creeped out slash upset over like a pair of shoes following you that is
[00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:19.400]   It is disconcerting especially if like
[00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:27.320]   You looked at something that isn't related to something you actually want. Right. That's when you tend to notice it
[00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:30.920]   So I can see why people think it's right. Yeah, I'm not buying horseshoes
[00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:36.440]   All right. Anyway, yeah, yeah, it's you know, I even don't even want to continue on
[00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:39.880]   Because it's right. Okay, it's not thank you. It's not it's not good
[00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:45.720]   My blood pressure. Yeah, it's just a poll. I don't think they're very useful for anything. They're dumb
[00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:51.720]   Yeah, but it's a one one one you're you're willing to go there. I'll just note newspapers went after radio
[00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:57.880]   They went after billboards. They went after television. They're going after the internet. Yeah, it's nothing. Yeah
[00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:00.200]   Yeah, let's take a little break
[00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:04.360]   We can actually this might be interesting go back in in time and look at the year in review
[00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:08.360]   Uh, Jason's put in a bunch of stories from the past year
[00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:11.000]   With
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   Nice. Thank you, Jason. We'll do that that
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:15.320]   Finally something to talk about instead of
[00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:19.800]   Washington Washington post polls have either of you ever done imperfect foods
[00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:24.760]   I I have I had a completely wrong
[00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:27.480]   Impression of what these guys
[00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:29.480]   Were imperfect foods
[00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:31.960]   They're actually pretty perfect
[00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:36.280]   My bottom line on this we've been we've been getting it now every week. I love it
[00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:42.200]   Everyday delicious groceries fall through the cracks of our food system just because how they look
[00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:50.040]   Imperfect foods is turning this around by sourcing quirky yet delicious foods and delivering them to you in a way proven to reduce emissions
[00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:52.600]   By the way, this this is a spot certain case you didn't notice
[00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:54.280]   Uh
[00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:58.040]   So let me talk about this because when I heard that and I that's the mate. That's the kind of the
[00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:02.440]   Top line pitch of food foods. I thought well, they're gonna you know, they're gonna
[00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:07.960]   I'm gonna have a rutabaga that looks like Richard Nixon or I'm gonna have a you know bruised apple or something
[00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:11.320]   No, actually this is fantastic food. I'll give you an example
[00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:12.840]   We got pomegranates
[00:28:12.840 --> 00:28:17.480]   There's there's smaller than the pomegranates the size of my head that I can buy at a whole foods
[00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:22.760]   But in every other respect they were delicious. They were sweet. They might even be better than the giant pomegranates
[00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:25.400]   It
[00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:30.600]   Turns out 35% of the food's food supply in this country gets unsold or uneaten
[00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:33.480]   more than a third
[00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:38.280]   Just because the grocery store doesn't you know want thinks nobody will buy it or whatever
[00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:42.920]   So you can change that equation within perfect foods is a grocery
[00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:47.000]   Delerve delivery service offering an entire line of sustainable groceries
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:50.680]   By the way, we can get a lot of our shopping done there because it's not just produce
[00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:52.760]   It's everything now
[00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:55.080]   They taste delicious. They reduce waste
[00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:58.520]   They uh, the way they do it is great. They they
[00:28:58.520 --> 00:29:04.200]   Organize the deliveries in the group so that the truck only goes to the neighborhood once a week
[00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:11.000]   So they reduce emissions fact it's about 25 to 75 fewer emissions than individual trips to the grocery store
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:16.040]   on average imperfect food customers save six to eight pounds of food with every order
[00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:18.760]   I just I
[00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:25.880]   This is better than your grocery delivery in so many ways. I get some of the best broccoli i've ever had from imperfect foods last week
[00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:30.760]   Artichokes, uh, and then we can also get butter cheese
[00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:36.200]   Uh chips everything almost everything we buy at the grocery store from imperfect food
[00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:41.560]   So this makes me so so happy and by the way, I'm really like this
[00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:44.120]   Say goodbye to packaging guilt
[00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:48.040]   It's the only national grocery delivery company that makes it easy to return your packaging
[00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:51.720]   After every order plus they don't use plastic bags
[00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:57.960]   So it's just a cardboard box with cardboard liners. So the the waste is very very minimal
[00:29:57.960 --> 00:30:04.440]   And there's no plastic in it, uh, you know, except for the you know prepackage stuff like for jay stuff
[00:30:04.440 --> 00:30:08.120]   I know that's my big thing right now. I'm really trying to cut back on plastics
[00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:14.040]   Uh, you get to choose. It's really good. Um, I and I I just think that
[00:30:14.520 --> 00:30:19.640]   The name of the company implies there's going to be something wrong with these and there's nothing as far as I can tell
[00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:25.640]   There is everything right with them. I guess they know if I may yes, you know, you think about it
[00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:30.280]   Uh, the ugliest tomatoes are usually the best most delicious to me. Absolutely
[00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:32.760]   Right. Absolutely
[00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:41.320]   You know, you really don't want the biggest zucchini or the biggest pomegranate the biggest anything plus grocery stores carry for instance
[00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:46.760]   Uh, they carry hos avocados instead of the I think the more delicate more delicious
[00:30:46.760 --> 00:30:53.400]   Greener fuertas because the fuertas show bruises and the hoses are black so they're bruised, but you can't tell
[00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:56.920]   That to me does not make it a great avocado
[00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:59.640]   imperfect foods is a solution to this
[00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:02.760]   Help help the world
[00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:07.400]   Just go to imperfect foods at dot com and look at these numbers and you'll see
[00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:15.640]   How great this is for the environment and how great it is for you imp perfect. I am p-e-r-f-e-c-t foods
[00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:22.440]   M-i-m-p-e-r-f-e-c-t foods dot com if you use a promo code twig you'll get 20 percent off

[00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:34.920]   so
[00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:41.240]   Uh, you know again on average imperfect foods customers save six to eight pounds of food
[00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:47.800]   With every order food that would be thrown out tossed away used to feed animals or something else not
[00:31:47.800 --> 00:31:51.000]   You know taking off the grocery shelves. That's a big deal
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:57.240]   And uh, and I have to say it's no sacrifice at all imperfect foods dot com the promo code is twig
[00:31:57.240 --> 00:31:59.640]   That's how you let them know you saw it here and please do use that

[00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:25.400]   Uh, yeah, it's great. It's like a farm box. It's very much like a farm box
[00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:31.320]   Um, but it's more like I would say it's across between a farm boxing and grocery delivery because you can get groceries too
[00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:38.520]   You can get everything and get rid of the dreaded brussel sprouts. You don't have yeah, we get brussel sprouts because we like you would
[00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:41.000]   They're delicious. Oh, no, they're not
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:49.160]   They are three mile island cabbages. They are they are freaks of nature. They were not they're called christmas tree balls
[00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:52.200]   Oh, that's that's appetizing
[00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:58.520]   That makes my parents used to call them christmas tree balls and I loved them because of it. It's so cute
[00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:03.640]   Do they today I learned from uh, did site that?
[00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:13.320]   sausage and uh, worst and potato salad is a christmas eve tradition in Germany. I'll buy that. Oh, yeah, that's good
[00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:15.960]   Isn't that what they eat every day?
[00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:20.120]   Yeah, it was fun. So it's traditional christmas eve every eve
[00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:22.440]   We eat it in the eve
[00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:24.920]   We eat bread in the morning sauce first
[00:33:24.920 --> 00:33:26.520]   went
[00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:30.200]   salad krauts at night or toffle and salad and cut off
[00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:33.400]   uh actually
[00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:36.520]   Is german so in germany do they call it german potato salad
[00:33:36.520 --> 00:33:41.320]   I'm just curious like like danishes aren't Danish. I don't think so
[00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:43.240]   They just call it cartovel with salad
[00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:49.240]   It's jibb but is it like so is it like american potato salad? No american potato salad is of course like everything else of bastardization
[00:33:49.240 --> 00:33:55.800]   They don't put you know helmans. There's no mannez in the german. No, it's vinegar and bacon vinegar. Yeah
[00:33:56.360 --> 00:33:58.360]   I really like it but on yeah
[00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:02.840]   Yeah, yeah, yeah german cucumber salad was magnificent too. Yeah, oh
[00:34:02.840 --> 00:34:08.920]   Here is the google graveyard for 2021 courtesy android
[00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:10.840]   police
[00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:12.840]   It's a crowded place this
[00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:18.600]   The last service to be killed this year shall be the first in this reverse chronological list. They say
[00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:21.240]   angular j s
[00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:23.480]   Wait a minute. They killed a oh
[00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:24.440]   No
[00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:28.840]   Ang they lives on his angular. They just took the j s out. Okay. No, that's no
[00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:31.560]   That's not duff. That's that's
[00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:33.000]   That's
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   Letter amazed me. We hardly knew ye
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:42.440]   It's a is this newsletter a newsletter? Yeah. Well, it was a newsletter service. They was launched like three months
[00:34:42.440 --> 00:34:48.520]   And it never really worked and they're killing it before it's lunch started and died in the same
[00:34:49.160 --> 00:34:51.160]   Time quarter. Wow
[00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:54.120]   Services gone before you know it, you know
[00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:56.040]   Wow
[00:34:56.040 --> 00:35:01.240]   You know the problem with doing this is it if people invest time and energy into creating a moo's letter
[00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:05.480]   or muse maybe this is the problem a moo's letter and
[00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:08.440]   Then it gets killed a month later. It's like
[00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:11.720]   I don't think anybody could actually use it. Yeah
[00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:13.640]   Yeah, I feel like
[00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:18.360]   You know, I would have seen marketing for it because I get marketed just about every new newsletter or service out there
[00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:24.760]   This was from the google area 120 team their experimental team
[00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:29.320]   Google toolbar which had been around for 21 years
[00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:34.680]   But I don't think anybody used toolbars with browsers these days, right
[00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:37.000]   Um
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.720]   No, they went through this as a kind of wonderful
[00:35:39.720 --> 00:35:42.120]   Um
[00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:43.880]   nostalgic visit
[00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:45.880]   to decade ago. Yeah
[00:35:46.680 --> 00:35:48.520]   Yeah, remember we had they we'd have the el
[00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:50.920]   Toolbar
[00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:55.240]   There were all sorts of toolbars you'd sometimes in your browser of three or four stacked
[00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:58.280]   Back because mostly because browsers didn't do anything
[00:35:58.280 --> 00:36:01.000]   the google
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.680]   The google toolbar basically was a search box below the address bar
[00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:10.520]   And had built in google translation support. Yeah, we don't need that because you just type it in you don't need anymore
[00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:13.240]   uh google my maps app
[00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:15.560]   The
[00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:18.920]   I didn't know this existed, but I used the version of this all the time
[00:36:18.920 --> 00:36:24.200]   Yeah, that will that and that will continue on. It's only the end read app. Yeah, so what does it do?
[00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:30.680]   You can create like like I actually we're going to portland right after christmas. Hopefully less it snows
[00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:37.400]   Um, and I just created like a map for like this is where our hotel is these are the four restaurants
[00:36:37.400 --> 00:36:41.720]   We want to eat out you just save everything you want to do it's like when you'd go to triple a
[00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:47.880]   And they give you a trip tick it was and they give it so as a paper map and you you tell them and they mark off
[00:36:47.880 --> 00:36:54.680]   The route and all the places you're going to stop and all that stuff triple a used to do that. Yeah, I don't know about that
[00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:58.840]   There's also a service called road tripper and i've actually used that service and it's really good
[00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:01.640]   It seems like that would be that should be built into maps
[00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:07.640]   Like you should be able to give it waypoints in maps and right i don't understand why they don't i've always thought this
[00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:14.760]   Do not yeah, i'm like why why is google leaving this by the side of the road because it doesn't make sense. Yeah, anyway
[00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:22.200]   Okay, I guess you can do you can view your my maps using google maps
[00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:30.360]   But they didn't want to make the complexity of creating a map be part of google maps. So if you go to google.com slash
[00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:36.280]   Well, they do you know, this is the other problem. No maps for you. Here's the address for you
[00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:45.800]   Here's the address google.com/maps/d/u/0/ I don't that doesn't seem that memorable that you can create a new map
[00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:52.280]   And all that so that's cool. I like that. I hope they don't kill that you can't even add layers
[00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:55.800]   That's yeah, no, it's a really it's a nice tool. Yeah
[00:37:55.800 --> 00:38:02.760]   Just so what they're killing is the android version of right just the app. It's just the app
[00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:11.320]   Uh, now i've lost my place by next was September 30 google bookmarks google now. Yeah, i'll have to go back. There we go
[00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:14.120]   google bookmarks
[00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:16.120]   well
[00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:19.560]   But they didn't kill bookmarks. This this was set me terribly when I saw the first
[00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:25.160]   This isn't the bookmarks in chrome. This is the that's bookmark, you know, like delicious and we use pinboard
[00:38:25.160 --> 00:38:30.520]   Uh pinboards great. I like pinboard bookmarks held on save places in the map app
[00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:38.600]   Actually, I did use that but the good news is your map saved places are still on maps, which is where you thought they were
[00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:41.160]   Okay
[00:38:41.160 --> 00:38:43.720]   chat base that's about four years old
[00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:48.440]   I don't know about it. It was an analytics. It was an analytics platform
[00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:52.200]   for the google's dialogue flow chatbot
[00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:54.760]   Oh, jeez
[00:38:54.760 --> 00:39:01.240]   Uh, now they bought fitbit remember and uh, and absorbed it a couple when did they absorb it fairly recently
[00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:03.160]   They have now killed
[00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:10.600]   They acquired it in 2019. They killed fitbit coach and fitbit yoga or fit star yoga coach was stupid
[00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:13.720]   Okay, I didn't even know fitbit yoga existed. Okay
[00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:15.960]   No
[00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:17.960]   No sadness there
[00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:23.560]   Okay, well fitbit coach was just annoying because they like it was a separate app and
[00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:27.960]   It was a video based standalone bodyweight workout app
[00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:34.040]   Yeah, and it was this whole separate app and it just it didn't work well
[00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:38.040]   It's gonna be the base functionality
[00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:42.520]   Actually an improved functionality will still be in the main fitbit app, but there is no
[00:39:42.520 --> 00:39:47.880]   More fitbit separate app separate app for fit star yoga separate
[00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:50.600]   Tour builder was a service
[00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:56.280]   Been around since 2013 allowed you to build interactive tours complete with images and videos inside google earth
[00:39:56.600 --> 00:40:01.800]   Oh, I remember that but but google earth still has similar tools. So this is I think we hyped this on the show
[00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:04.200]   So cool. Yes
[00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:08.280]   Oh really when it first came out in 2013. I think we did wow of course we did
[00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:11.320]   Expeditions and tour creator
[00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:14.280]   This is a
[00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:19.480]   Well expeditions is the one you can do this is yeah, but this is the vr platform you use with cardboard
[00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:21.480]   it basically
[00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:23.080]   then you know the
[00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:30.200]   Students could go anywhere. Yeah, cool american natural museum. Yeah natural. What's the natural history? Bye
[00:40:30.200 --> 00:40:33.800]   Uh tour creator has been killed off. Okay poly
[00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:41.240]   This was launched 2017 a repository for 3d objects
[00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:44.200]   You could what's the metaverse gonna do without them?
[00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:48.920]   Apparently that's why they're killing it the metaverse went on without them
[00:40:48.920 --> 00:40:51.640]   Leaving poly in the dust
[00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:54.840]   Wait a minute google play at movies and tv
[00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:57.960]   Which we're not talking about
[00:40:57.960 --> 00:41:02.920]   Okay, this was replaced by google tv
[00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:08.120]   But this is like their chat brandy. I don't even understand anyway
[00:41:08.120 --> 00:41:14.360]   Yeah, whatever it's gone measure is gone. We knew that this is the
[00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:18.040]   Metasack yeah, you can't measure your own banana anymore
[00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:23.560]   Yeah banana for scale. Oh, no no longer stopping there. Keep going keep going
[00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:27.000]   sync render
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:32.280]   Uh, it was a developer focused platform a cloud rendering service for animation and visual effects
[00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:35.240]   They bought it in 2014 killed it in 2021
[00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:43.560]   It was used in american hustle transformers dark side of the moon and star trek into darkness
[00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:46.200]   Hmm
[00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:51.880]   Timely they killed timely in back in may that was the alarm clock
[00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:54.920]   Um
[00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:56.920]   Oh, well, no more service
[00:41:56.920 --> 00:42:00.520]   The whole thing is gone. Oh, I used timely
[00:42:00.520 --> 00:42:08.040]   I remember that because you'd set the alarm on any device and every device would now have an alarm and all your devices would go off at once
[00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:13.240]   Oh, no, no, that was good because uh, you might left your phone and somewhere else
[00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:15.960]   But everything you have the whole thing would go off
[00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:20.360]   I actually like these I'm bad at you for that one's timely was a really nice clock
[00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:26.120]   That's sad. They so that even the servers are gone for that one in april google shopping the app was killed off
[00:42:26.120 --> 00:42:28.120]   in march
[00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:30.680]   Google public alerts and google crisis map
[00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:33.560]   I'm sure there's something to replace that
[00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:36.120]   google go links in march
[00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:39.080]   The short link shortening service
[00:42:39.080 --> 00:42:41.640]   Google cardboard
[00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:44.840]   I remember when you and jina came back from google. I owe
[00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:48.520]   Trying to put it together in the backseat. Yeah. Yeah, that's right
[00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:53.640]   Dina did it we couldn't it was under everybody's seat at google. I owe yeah
[00:42:53.640 --> 00:42:55.480]   uh
[00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:57.480]   And swift for tensor flow
[00:42:57.480 --> 00:43:04.600]   Uh, you probably know about that stacey. I don't uh, it was apple swift language combined with
[00:43:04.600 --> 00:43:07.720]   google's tensor flow open source library
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:12.120]   Yeah, and tilt brush
[00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:15.000]   Which was a really fun application
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:18.600]   Of VR application, but yes, it's a little bit source. Yeah. Yeah
[00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:23.160]   Do this person unironically use the phrase funnest vr of applications
[00:43:23.160 --> 00:43:27.320]   Tilt brush was one of google's funnest vr applications
[00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:30.520]   I think that is an unironic use
[00:43:30.520 --> 00:43:35.320]   Of the superlative of the pseudo superlative funnest
[00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:41.880]   Should be most fun. Yes, it greats. I'm just gonna say greats a little
[00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:47.000]   I think though, uh as we've learned in our magnificent bastard tongue
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:55.240]   Words become acceptable over time. I know I know i'm like oh is that is that a word that is about to become acceptable?
[00:43:55.240 --> 00:43:56.360]   I think so
[00:43:56.360 --> 00:43:59.480]   And I think you nailed it because I think it was I used originally
[00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:05.240]   ironically like a kid would say funnest and adults when they said it were being ironic and then
[00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:09.000]   the as often as the case by the way with languages
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:16.680]   It shed the irony and all that remained was the glitter I was reading today or about magazines through the century
[00:44:16.680 --> 00:44:22.760]   Because i'm working on a project about that and i didn't know this time invented all kinds of new words
[00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:25.000]   including
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:26.520]   tycoon
[00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:27.880]   socialite, oh
[00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:29.000]   Pundit
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:30.600]   Oh kudos. Oh
[00:44:30.600 --> 00:44:31.800]   estimate
[00:44:31.800 --> 00:44:34.920]   male chauvinist and tunnel evangelist wow
[00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:41.240]   I was at first. It sounded like it was all Gatsby era, but I see some of the more recent stuff coming up
[00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:44.440]   Wow good for time
[00:44:44.440 --> 00:44:47.320]   How did they invent sus?
[00:44:47.320 --> 00:44:50.600]   What?
[00:44:50.600 --> 00:44:51.400]   sus
[00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:53.720]   Us being suspicious oh sus. Oh
[00:44:53.720 --> 00:44:57.640]   That's right. Norris was credited with naming world war two in
[00:44:58.120 --> 00:45:00.680]   39 because at the time there'd only been one
[00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:06.280]   Yeah, I don't think it was hard. It's like web three. Yeah, right? It's not hard. I was like, okay
[00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:11.720]   I guess we'll give him for the next world war. What what should we call it the next world war the one after
[00:45:11.720 --> 00:45:17.080]   Do we're gonna call it one a one the sequel? Oh
[00:45:17.080 --> 00:45:21.720]   What wait wait okay that one's obvious, but like if you use the word tycoon
[00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:26.440]   How is anybody supposed to know what you're talking about? I don't know
[00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:32.040]   Right because I mean, no, well, that's like when we talked about unicorn companies for a year
[00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:34.120]   You had to describe unicorn. I guess it's true
[00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:37.160]   That's a value didn't excessive a billion dollars and now we're just like oh
[00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:42.600]   Didn't wasn't there an fscot Fitzgerald novel the last tycoon so obviously it got picked up pretty quick
[00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:49.720]   It's also a title applied to foreigners to the Shogun of Japan in power between 1857 and 1868
[00:45:49.720 --> 00:45:52.280]   Oh, that's where it came from. So maybe it was the late
[00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:55.320]   19th century that the jimies tycoon
[00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:58.200]   Great lord. There you go. That's okay
[00:45:58.200 --> 00:46:00.280]   in
[00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:06.760]   Very first thing google killed this year was the loon project to put internet connectivity in a balloon
[00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:11.640]   In the stratosphere. Oh, yeah, if you don't last year when we did this show remember
[00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:15.720]   We did a show and we predicted what they were going to kill in the coming year
[00:46:15.720 --> 00:46:21.160]   I have no idea what we said they were gonna kill but i'm curious how well we did let's not go to that tape
[00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:28.680]   There was drinking it was mary joke only mica. I think yeah, oh we should find that
[00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:32.840]   We should oh no that was like two years ago because that was last year was covet
[00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:36.840]   Right was it was the last one before that's the life disappeared
[00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:43.080]   That's the one where the night at 2019 Nielsen made each of us different drinks to based on our personality. Yeah
[00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:45.960]   uh
[00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:50.760]   One more thing the first app to be killed in 2021 the first app was app maker
[00:46:51.640 --> 00:46:57.320]   uh, which I had used actually to make apps they say in uh andrew police says in this article that it was for
[00:46:57.320 --> 00:47:01.240]   Businesses, but i'd used app maker to make apps and it was actually pretty cool. So
[00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:05.160]   There you go. That's the official
[00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:12.680]   Then that's the changelog that's the ultimate changelog those this is the life changelog doomlog doomlog
[00:47:12.680 --> 00:47:18.360]   Thank you andrew police for putting that all working hard together. Yeah, oh
[00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:24.280]   With commentary nonetheless. Yeah, well done the funnest commentary
[00:47:24.280 --> 00:47:27.000]   so
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:32.360]   Is the next stage mostest funnest or most fun. Yeah, I don't know it's funster
[00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:41.800]   Google says chrome os users are engaging with andrewed apps 50 more than they did last year
[00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:45.240]   I don't even know what that means. What does it mean?
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:49.560]   Do you use uh andrewed apps in your chrome book?
[00:47:49.560 --> 00:47:52.360]   bear
[00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:54.760]   barely
[00:47:54.760 --> 00:47:56.840]   apparently you're uh in the minority that
[00:47:56.840 --> 00:47:59.080]   the
[00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:03.400]   Andrewed apps are used more this year, but I mean, I don't know how much they're used
[00:48:03.400 --> 00:48:07.000]   Well, I want to try me to have some space. So I don't know youtube is on there
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:10.040]   And it took me and I should have written it down
[00:48:10.040 --> 00:48:15.720]   It took me days to figure out how to stop it from launching the app every time I clicked on a youtube link
[00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:21.480]   Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, you made it your default player and you've got a crumb razzer there
[00:48:21.480 --> 00:48:23.240]   Which really is how you prefer. I'm sure
[00:48:23.240 --> 00:48:25.080]   Yes
[00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:26.120]   Yes
[00:48:26.120 --> 00:48:29.560]   2021 was a good year for app publishers
[00:48:29.560 --> 00:48:33.640]   more than 900 publishers worldwide
[00:48:33.640 --> 00:48:41.320]   Saw their first million dollars or more in net income and that number is up significantly over years
[00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:43.560]   previously
[00:48:43.560 --> 00:48:51.640]   Uh, the you know it's split between apples the store and the google store the green is google play the blue is uh app store
[00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:54.680]   Um
[00:48:54.680 --> 00:48:56.680]   Actually, the biggest growth was last year
[00:48:56.680 --> 00:48:59.080]   2020
[00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:04.760]   Yeah, and then there was a little drop off for 2021, but still that's a lot it's 900 companies that uh
[00:49:04.760 --> 00:49:09.800]   You know suddenly exceeded a million dollars in net revenue can those be one person
[00:49:10.440 --> 00:49:14.040]   Yeah, many many of them are probably I would guess yeah
[00:49:14.040 --> 00:49:22.120]   I wondered did they did they classify like what types of apps I assume? Yeah entertainment or they did they did so uh
[00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:27.800]   This is in the app store, but it may be roughly let's see. No, this is both
[00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:36.040]   Okay, so games in 2021 with 32 percent 11 percent social networking. That's a that's a growth over the last couple of years
[00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:38.920]   entertainment down a little bit 7 percent
[00:49:39.560 --> 00:49:41.560]   health and fitness 7 percent
[00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:46.360]   Uh productivity had doubled year over year 6 percent
[00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:50.200]   And then a big chunk of other I guess yeah
[00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:53.960]   Communication publishers did very well on google play
[00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:57.400]   According to communications publisher
[00:49:57.400 --> 00:49:59.880]   um
[00:49:59.880 --> 00:50:03.560]   I have no idea what that is. Well, I think it's your people
[00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:08.200]   Right. Oh, oh like media. I would think it'd be like blue jeans or zoom
[00:50:09.160 --> 00:50:11.640]   communication. Oh now we don't I don't know
[00:50:11.640 --> 00:50:18.200]   New publishers 139 publishers are projected to surpass the million dollar mark
[00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:25.080]   Oh a publisher is anybody who puts an app up. So thus their communications apps thus its
[00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:29.720]   Yes things like communication. So it's okay. That makes more sense down. They're all
[00:50:29.720 --> 00:50:35.640]   You were right. You were they'll publish apps which makes no sense like this, but what other verb gonna use
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:39.000]   No, that's the word
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:41.000]   I actually worked post
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:44.760]   About two books about libraries and stuff that I really liked
[00:50:44.760 --> 00:50:52.120]   Um today and I realized I was putting the verb into publish that was a I said or as we call it now share
[00:50:52.120 --> 00:50:56.520]   So it's a it's a it's a antiquated verb
[00:50:56.520 --> 00:51:01.640]   Yes
[00:51:01.640 --> 00:51:06.920]   You can tell like uh sure. Yes, Jeff. They're tolerating me going off all these tasks
[00:51:06.920 --> 00:51:11.640]   Tensions with nothing to say back was what the hell that killed another 45 seconds
[00:51:11.640 --> 00:51:15.960]   I don't know what that means. I like actually here's the shocker. Are you ready?
[00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:19.880]   Yes top domains for 2021
[00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:26.520]   Google which of course dominated for years was number two to tick tock
[00:51:26.520 --> 00:51:31.240]   Tick tock up from number seven
[00:51:31.240 --> 00:51:34.280]   last year most popular domains
[00:51:35.240 --> 00:51:40.280]   in uh august through uh december of 2021 tick tock
[00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:45.560]   Wow, I was on tick like I sucked down a lot of tick tock
[00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:50.920]   But did you do it in the app? That's what's interesting. This is not the app. Yeah, this is tick tock.com versus
[00:51:50.920 --> 00:51:51.960]   Google
[00:51:51.960 --> 00:51:57.640]   It is I bet it's because people when you share something on like facebook or twitter it opens the web, huh?
[00:51:57.640 --> 00:51:59.800]   The web
[00:51:59.800 --> 00:52:00.520]   Maybe so
[00:52:00.520 --> 00:52:05.160]   And and where's google you offer don't go to google to go to google so last year
[00:52:05.160 --> 00:52:10.920]   The top 10 were google with exactly what you would think google facebook
[00:52:10.920 --> 00:52:15.480]   Microsoft apple netflix amazon tick tock youtube instagram twitter
[00:52:15.480 --> 00:52:24.680]   Kind of got you shu- shook up in 2021 tick tock then google facebook microsoft apple amazon
[00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:27.400]   Netflix youtube twitter. What's app?
[00:52:28.440 --> 00:52:30.280]   Where did instagram go?
[00:52:30.280 --> 00:52:32.280]   And instagram fell off
[00:52:32.280 --> 00:52:34.680]   Chis gone
[00:52:34.680 --> 00:52:41.000]   Was it last year that instagram they they instagram changed it so you could no longer see things on the web app unless
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:44.520]   That's what happened. They did they wanted you they pushed you to the app you're right
[00:52:44.520 --> 00:52:49.080]   Yep, so i'm old enough to remember when yahoo was number one
[00:52:49.080 --> 00:52:55.960]   Long since you're not i was like that's not that long to go
[00:52:56.920 --> 00:53:01.720]   forever in internet time, but this is all from cloudflare so they have some pretty good
[00:53:01.720 --> 00:53:04.200]   They have stats i would trust this. Yeah
[00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:10.840]   Yeah, boy. I think we got to get dana boyd or some sociologist on this one. I mean, what is this?
[00:53:10.840 --> 00:53:13.480]   What does this indicate?
[00:53:13.480 --> 00:53:18.680]   Really interesting to is i think you're right lael is is how are they defining web visit?
[00:53:18.680 --> 00:53:21.400]   Is critical to this list?
[00:53:23.080 --> 00:53:26.920]   Yeah, i mean, i don't know it just says people going to that site
[00:53:26.920 --> 00:53:32.360]   Nonetheless tiktok's exploited. Yeah, um and it's the um
[00:53:32.360 --> 00:53:38.600]   I didn't put it on the rundown because it would have pissed me off unless you want to piss me off
[00:53:38.600 --> 00:53:41.160]   But i don't know it's a sport. Um
[00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:47.880]   Vox had this ridiculous piece day just snotty snotty knows about oh tiktok and all this horrible things people wasting their time
[00:53:47.880 --> 00:53:49.960]   It's just terrible
[00:53:49.960 --> 00:53:51.240]   Screw you
[00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:54.440]   It's the people making their own content. There's great stuff there. It's fun
[00:53:54.440 --> 00:53:59.720]   I went through today for about an hour looking for somebody to irritate and but I enjoyed it
[00:53:59.720 --> 00:54:04.760]   They're really it's funny. There was such phobia in the trump administration about tiktok being a chinese
[00:54:04.760 --> 00:54:11.160]   Company and spying on our youth etc etc. That's just disappeared now people just enjoy tiktok for what it is
[00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:13.640]   Yeah, I don't know maybe we put our
[00:54:13.640 --> 00:54:16.760]   I say there are still people who are concerned about it. Yeah, maybe it is. I don't know
[00:54:16.760 --> 00:54:19.080]   I don't know
[00:54:19.080 --> 00:54:22.280]   For some reason in all of 2021
[00:54:22.280 --> 00:54:30.840]   YouTube which usually ranked six or seven was number one on one day in 2021 february second
[00:54:30.840 --> 00:54:33.240]   2021
[00:54:33.240 --> 00:54:35.240]   God, well, could that be
[00:54:35.240 --> 00:54:40.840]   Why says cloudflare one can only guess but back then although it was the week of the super bowl
[00:54:40.840 --> 00:54:46.440]   And some commercials like the one from doritos with matthew mcconahay were out on that day
[00:54:46.840 --> 00:54:52.360]   There was another newsworthy event the man mar coup d'etat had happened the day before
[00:54:52.360 --> 00:54:59.560]   And remember this video of a fitness instructor. She was filming her workout as the cool
[00:54:59.560 --> 00:55:05.080]   Was happening you could see the military pulling up at the palace
[00:55:05.080 --> 00:55:08.680]   And it became viral
[00:55:08.680 --> 00:55:11.400]   Was also the day
[00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:13.480]   I don't know
[00:55:13.480 --> 00:55:17.880]   Donald trump announced a new legal team for the impeachment trial. I don't know team three trial four
[00:55:17.880 --> 00:55:19.960]   I don't know it's hard to keep track
[00:55:19.960 --> 00:55:24.360]   Bezos announced he would step down as ceo on february second thought youtube event. No
[00:55:24.360 --> 00:55:30.360]   February 11th baby shark dance was the most viewed video of all time
[00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:36.760]   Giving me an excuse to play it one more time. No, i'm not gonna do that
[00:55:36.760 --> 00:55:40.840]   I should can I show this video of the
[00:55:42.680 --> 00:55:45.240]   This is from bbc news. They'll probably take it down. So I
[00:55:45.240 --> 00:55:49.640]   Just wrote the sound down no sound and then they won't know that we're playing there
[00:55:49.640 --> 00:55:54.360]   Little video so she was just doing a little exercise routine
[00:55:54.360 --> 00:56:01.480]   You see at the at the gates of the palace in me and mar when military vehicles start to pull up
[00:56:01.480 --> 00:56:07.720]   She's oblivious. She's just doing her her thing. This is the beginning of the coup and me and mar here come the
[00:56:07.720 --> 00:56:11.000]   Here come the trucks. She's not just a care. No
[00:56:11.640 --> 00:56:15.080]   She's she's doing her little it's actually kind of hysterical
[00:56:15.080 --> 00:56:23.160]   It's a metaphor for so much. Yeah, this is how you're not dancing while rober's this this is life on the internet
[00:56:23.160 --> 00:56:25.960]   of course, there's a big barricade across the
[00:56:25.960 --> 00:56:29.560]   The way I don't know
[00:56:29.560 --> 00:56:33.160]   I guess it's some oh, yeah, they're opening the barricade. They're going in
[00:56:33.160 --> 00:56:36.920]   They're going in the military seizes power the hunta
[00:56:38.360 --> 00:56:45.800]   Seizes the power and as the bbc points out the lyrics are saying they are coming one by one to fight over the throne
[00:56:45.800 --> 00:56:49.000]   But she didn't know how apt that was there they go
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:53.720]   Is that why it's always appreciate some good irony there. Yeah, so
[00:56:53.720 --> 00:56:56.520]   Yeah, they understand I already for but yeah
[00:56:56.520 --> 00:57:04.600]   So uh the cloud cloud first says the only thing we could figure out in february second is that that's why youtube became number one that day
[00:57:05.960 --> 00:57:12.200]   Uh social media domains continued high in the ranking the nine main social media applications all in the top 100
[00:57:12.200 --> 00:57:20.280]   The only one out wish they did this over time like longer time. Well, they do look you know, you'll be happy to hear this the only one out was
[00:57:20.280 --> 00:57:22.680]   Cora.com
[00:57:22.680 --> 00:57:24.680]   So they do this is a year
[00:57:24.680 --> 00:57:27.960]   Yeah, this plot and so you can see with the colors
[00:57:27.960 --> 00:57:29.960]   Uh
[00:57:29.960 --> 00:57:34.760]   You know facebook's green so it's pretty high in the these are the rankings on the left one through
[00:57:35.320 --> 00:57:41.240]   I have I am curious like how many new entrants we've had in the last 10 years for social media
[00:57:41.240 --> 00:57:47.640]   Yeah, or in any of these. I mean just think about like when was the last new entrance to
[00:57:47.640 --> 00:57:50.520]   This particular table is I mean from
[00:57:50.520 --> 00:57:57.240]   Most popular social media domains in late 2021 because it varied throughout the year
[00:57:57.240 --> 00:58:04.360]   But as of right around now tiktok facebook youtube twitter instagram snapchat reddit pinterest linkedin quora
[00:58:05.080 --> 00:58:08.360]   Stacy I think you just made a really important point snapchat still
[00:58:08.360 --> 00:58:13.800]   Uh, Stacy just the fact that tiktok could come out of
[00:58:13.800 --> 00:58:17.480]   Kind of nowhere and go to number one
[00:58:17.480 --> 00:58:21.400]   Is to say that there are huge opportunities compete with the big kids
[00:58:21.400 --> 00:58:25.720]   Well, actually you gotta have the back of the Chinese. I'm gonna. I'm gonna. Well actually you
[00:58:25.720 --> 00:58:34.040]   So tiktok purchased a company called musically, which was really big on the tween girl set and I can't remember when they did that deal
[00:58:34.600 --> 00:58:38.040]   But that helped propel them into the direction they ended up with
[00:58:38.040 --> 00:58:40.680]   It was a jumpstart
[00:58:40.680 --> 00:58:45.080]   Uh, but it was much smaller much smaller. Yeah. Well, yes
[00:58:45.080 --> 00:58:50.840]   That was a few years ago. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, this is something so only yeah
[00:58:50.840 --> 00:58:55.640]   tiktok maybe came out of nowhere, but it kind of came out of nowhere over the last five years
[00:58:55.640 --> 00:59:02.040]   Well, it's like it's like google buying youtube, you know, give him a heads up in video, right?
[00:59:02.040 --> 00:59:05.160]   So you could yeah, I don't mean there wasn't a head start there but
[00:59:05.160 --> 00:59:08.280]   Who would have thought you could invite dance?
[00:59:08.280 --> 00:59:14.440]   By that's who I was looking for is bite dance that bought them. Yeah, the bottom. Yeah bite dance was not a small company
[00:59:14.440 --> 00:59:21.160]   No, no, no, no true true in China, but well what I'm saying is if you if if if your water brothers
[00:59:21.160 --> 00:59:23.800]   May have rest in peace, you know
[00:59:23.800 --> 00:59:29.560]   You had the it was like watching succession by the way, you know could a succession by it by
[00:59:30.040 --> 00:59:35.080]   Watch my calls go. Joe or whatever it's called. Oh, yeah, that's fun. They're always trying to buy somebody. Yeah, yeah
[00:59:35.080 --> 00:59:42.040]   Most popular chat apps platforms not much change signal up a point
[00:59:42.040 --> 00:59:44.680]   Taking over for we chat
[00:59:44.680 --> 00:59:49.720]   Number one is what's app guess that's not a surprise number two telegram number three we chat
[00:59:49.720 --> 00:59:54.760]   Oh, I'm sorry signal went down. Oh point. I'm sorry number four signal
[00:59:54.760 --> 00:59:58.040]   So what's app is pretty dominant?
[00:59:59.240 --> 01:00:01.240]   as the preferred chat app
[01:00:01.240 --> 01:00:10.040]   Um, I think this is a little bit colored by the fact that this is web based as opposed to app based
[01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:12.520]   I mean really most people use
[01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:17.320]   Absolutely, but maybe they're just looking at the IP addresses. I'm not sure
[01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:23.240]   I guess because it's cloud flare they're looking at
[01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:26.600]   Access to the servers. So it maybe it doesn't matter
[01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:32.520]   Maybe it doesn't matter most popular tell us somewhere in this. I'm sure they do and if I had read it more carefully
[01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:35.160]   I would know this
[01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:40.680]   Um broad internet traffic related year in review. So I guess it isn't just websites
[01:00:40.680 --> 01:00:45.000]   It's internet traffic as a whole and they certainly know that
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:50.360]   Uh for a number of reasons. I mean they're the kind of the front end to a lot of sites on the internet
[01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:52.280]   um
[01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:56.760]   Signal skyrocketed in january, but we chat came back in february
[01:00:57.720 --> 01:00:59.880]   You remember when signal started to skyrocket
[01:00:59.880 --> 01:01:03.000]   Um when what's app announced that they were gonna
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:09.320]   They're the private share all their information share their information with facebook. That's a that's exactly way. Oops. Oops
[01:01:09.320 --> 01:01:12.280]   most popular metaverse domains
[01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:17.400]   Roblox fortnight second life. There's not a lot of competition
[01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:21.640]   Oculus and minecraft not even in the top 100 thousand
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:27.400]   Well are those are the way how are those web at all?
[01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:33.720]   That's it's it's it's got to be internet traffic in january. It's got to be a traffic exercise. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep
[01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:40.520]   So there you go. Actually, that's really good. We're gonna I think we'll be following that year every year now from now on the uh, that's a really good
[01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:42.680]   cloud flare
[01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:44.120]   top
[01:01:44.120 --> 01:01:46.760]   Well, and that's why I think it's interesting to see like
[01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:48.920]   Over time
[01:01:48.920 --> 01:01:54.040]   Partially because I think it would show how once you're big enough you kind of just get entrenched up there
[01:01:54.600 --> 01:02:01.960]   And it makes sense. I mean if google everything about google including maps and did it say it included mail? Let's see. I hear
[01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:05.480]   Um
[01:02:05.480 --> 01:02:07.720]   See
[01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:14.760]   Maps translate photos flights books and news. Okay, but it doesn't include mail. Yeah gmail must be all right by itself
[01:02:14.760 --> 01:02:17.320]   Bigger than anybody. Yeah
[01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:21.720]   That's interesting. It doesn't include gmail. So it's not that's really kind of not fair
[01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:29.080]   Well, no, it's just the more services you have the more reasons people come to you and that makes a hundred percent sense
[01:02:29.080 --> 01:02:39.000]   Also the world where things are still embedded to an extent, right? You still can query something in your browser and not go through multiple pages
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:41.880]   um
[01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:43.640]   Google's highly efficient still
[01:02:43.640 --> 01:02:47.880]   As much as the e-group complains about them they are
[01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:54.440]   Life easy for people and bad for startups and competition
[01:02:54.440 --> 01:03:01.480]   Let's take a little break and then we'll I think jeff has prepared some tick tock enjoyment for us
[01:03:01.480 --> 01:03:05.160]   Some something on our plate not as much as I wanted
[01:03:05.160 --> 01:03:09.960]   Ah, I don't want this to be true this week in tick tock
[01:03:09.960 --> 01:03:15.400]   No, we have to we have one tick tock and we have one tick tock story that I think it's gonna be very interesting
[01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:20.440]   It's particularly for the le port family and what's the what's odyssey? What are you talking about?
[01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:23.240]   Tick tock an odyssey
[01:03:23.240 --> 01:03:25.400]   I have no idea. No, I'm talking to stacey
[01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:31.160]   What did you just say tick tock an odyssey? Oh, no, I was gonna say with tick tock
[01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:36.040]   One of the most aggravating things is at the end of the year all they're doing is showing off like the most bibral video
[01:03:36.040 --> 01:03:39.880]   Oh, like what was your but so basically you're seeing all these videos. Oh
[01:03:39.880 --> 01:03:47.560]   Yeah, that's annoying now. I don't understand does a creator have to go along with that or is tick tock just doing it to them
[01:03:47.960 --> 01:03:51.080]   I think they repost it. Yeah, okay the creator reposted
[01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:54.440]   So tick tock tells you what your most viral video is and then you post it
[01:03:54.440 --> 01:03:59.720]   Yeah, they do that on a facebook people do that my top 12 pictures from facebook or 10 or whatever it is
[01:03:59.720 --> 01:04:02.920]   Oh, I kind of like it's not facebook instagram. What instagram?
[01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:11.080]   I do not no because we've seen them all and you've yeah, you want new you want there's a demand for fresh content on tick tock
[01:04:11.080 --> 01:04:17.240]   Henry tells me I need my fresh. Oh, don't believe rush feels the pressure man. He's oh, I bet he went
[01:04:17.880 --> 01:04:21.000]   The whole family went to mexico for vacation and he's like
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:24.280]   I gotta make kind of make video gotta make video
[01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:27.720]   Because he got to feed the feed the monster

[01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:20.760]   I know the idea of making your website. I mean everybody likes the idea, but it also is
[01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:24.440]   Challenging because you worry it's going to cost a lot it's going to be hard to do
[01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:29.080]   Going to be a lot of maintenance not with userway one line of javascript makes your website

[01:08:08.840 --> 01:08:15.240]   userway.org/tuit userway.org/tuit
[01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:22.680]   If you've been waiting and waiting for an update to your pixel 6, Jeff, you thought you got it
[01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:25.640]   Did you? No, I didn't. Yeah
[01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:29.960]   Stacey you did somebody got it. Maybe it was an I thought I got it. Yeah
[01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:32.440]   So you were the unlucky one
[01:08:32.440 --> 01:08:35.720]   Because google's paused it
[01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:40.600]   So the big December update which is not just a security update but was a fix for a lot of things
[01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:47.320]   Apparently caused some number of people to have connectivity problems that reduced it reduced their
[01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:53.880]   You know the bars and they were dropping calls that were getting low low quality. I don't know if you've been
[01:08:53.880 --> 01:08:55.880]   My island has terrible cell service
[01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:03.640]   So there's been a lot of you know question back and forth. What's going on? Why can't I get it?
[01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:06.680]   What this is the slowest rollout ever in history?
[01:09:06.680 --> 01:09:10.600]   Well now it's pretty apparent that google has actually paused it because of these
[01:09:10.600 --> 01:09:12.680]   connectivity issues
[01:09:12.680 --> 01:09:14.680]   And until they fix it, they're not going to push it out
[01:09:14.680 --> 01:09:19.000]   So the December update at this point probably a january update
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:24.280]   And uh, and don't feel bad if you didn't get it because very few people except Stacey got it
[01:09:24.280 --> 01:09:26.040]   so
[01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:33.080]   This just this just oh you want to this just in yes, I don't know. Is this just in um
[01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:41.400]   The ftc is looking at amazon's cloud business. Did you see that story? Oh, I didn't see it was in blueberg. It's a it's a blue berg. It's so
[01:09:41.400 --> 01:09:43.080]   um
[01:09:43.080 --> 01:09:48.200]   Federal investigators have contacted several companies about AWS amazon web services
[01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:51.720]   um and lina con at it again
[01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:54.040]   Yeah
[01:09:54.040 --> 01:09:58.200]   She I think you know, I think we can safely say congress is going to do uh diddly
[01:09:58.200 --> 01:10:01.160]   Because they can't seem to get anything done anyway
[01:10:01.160 --> 01:10:03.240]   So this seems like an unlikely
[01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:10.520]   Scenario, but if there's any hope of regulation of big tech in the united states is going to be through the ftc
[01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:13.480]   And that's terrible because the ftc a
[01:10:13.480 --> 01:10:20.040]   They have regulatory guidelines. So what will happen is if they find or censure amazon here
[01:10:20.680 --> 01:10:24.680]   Amazon will sue them. They've clearly they've already demanded a recusal
[01:10:24.680 --> 01:10:28.760]   Amazon's clearly not gonna just like roll over on this so then we'll get a lawsuit
[01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:31.960]   Then we'll get the inevitable countersuit
[01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:37.960]   Then we'll get you know the appeals process and everything and it'll be just like microsoft antitrust all over again. Yep
[01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:43.720]   She of course when she was a clummy law school professor wrote papers
[01:10:45.160 --> 01:10:51.960]   Warning about foundational antitrust paper. Yeah warning about amazon and that's why amazon said she has to recuse herself
[01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:57.880]   Uh courts said no, she doesn't and now that she's the chairperson of the ftc
[01:10:57.880 --> 01:11:03.000]   Ftc it looks like there's going to be a lot more activity against big tech from the ft
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:07.480]   Which and she has certain muscle, but you're right congress wall congress is doing stuff for headlines
[01:11:07.480 --> 01:11:09.800]   mike maznick and jeff cossup were going
[01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:13.480]   angry today because clobosh are in company we're demanding to know about
[01:11:13.960 --> 01:11:15.720]   um
[01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:17.640]   moderation decisions from the platforms well
[01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:22.920]   That's the first amendment question. It's not that government's right to do that you wouldn't ask the near times
[01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:25.560]   You move how dare you ask anybody else?
[01:11:25.560 --> 01:11:28.600]   Um, but they're just doing it for they know that they can't do it
[01:11:28.600 --> 01:11:33.880]   They know what a violence the first amendment, but they're doing it to get a headlines. Yeah, and so that's what car versus for out for
[01:11:33.880 --> 01:11:36.200]   Yeah, it's kind of a depressing
[01:11:36.200 --> 01:11:39.960]   There's real work to be done, but they're yeah jerks
[01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:46.520]   Uh, well, they're just turning out to be the pauls that we used to think they were and
[01:11:46.520 --> 01:11:49.080]   Durs out. They really are all's pauls
[01:11:49.080 --> 01:11:51.880]   halls p.o. l.s
[01:11:51.880 --> 01:11:54.520]   Paul Paul. Oh
[01:11:54.520 --> 01:11:56.120]   got it
[01:11:56.120 --> 01:11:58.760]   It comes from what is it come from like tamani hall and
[01:11:58.760 --> 01:12:05.240]   Uh, you just you know the the notion of his kind of corrupt ward healer who uh, it runs the joint
[01:12:05.240 --> 01:12:09.960]   but doesn't really look out for his constituency particularly unless it serves his
[01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:12.760]   ambitions
[01:12:12.760 --> 01:12:20.120]   Uh, that's what I mean when I call you a paul. Okay. Uh, the first tesla baby has been born
[01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:24.120]   This is a pretty amazing story
[01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:26.680]   so, uh
[01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:30.200]   You're on sherry 33 your husband keating sherry 34
[01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:33.480]   of uh, wane pennsylvania
[01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:36.280]   On their way to the hospital
[01:12:36.280 --> 01:12:38.680]   when her water broke
[01:12:39.240 --> 01:12:41.240]   Traffic was really bad
[01:12:41.240 --> 01:12:45.800]   Wasn't moving too well. Um
[01:12:45.800 --> 01:12:50.840]   Well, he puts the car on auto he sets the nav for the hospital
[01:12:50.840 --> 01:12:54.600]   and
[01:12:54.600 --> 01:12:56.920]   And uh, and he says he's got his hand
[01:12:56.920 --> 01:13:04.440]   Lightly left hand lightly on the wheel log lancing back to check on his wife in the backs in or the kids in the back seat
[01:13:04.440 --> 01:13:07.000]   And it's because we're willing to tend to his wife in the front seat
[01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:10.840]   Euron's contractions were one minute apart. You know what that means
[01:13:10.840 --> 01:13:15.320]   She was squeezing my hand at the point where I thought she was going to shatter it. I was saying okay
[01:13:15.320 --> 01:13:22.280]   Focus on your breathing. My adrenaline was pumping. I said rafa everything's fine your baby sister is arriving
[01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:24.680]   The 20 minute drive
[01:13:24.680 --> 01:13:29.800]   To the hospital felt like two hours each time she caught her breath between contractions
[01:13:29.800 --> 01:13:32.600]   She glanced at the gps to clock their progress
[01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:39.560]   Just as they pulled up to the hospital the tesla driving the whole way I might add she whispered
[01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:41.960]   Oh my god, keeding she's out
[01:13:41.960 --> 01:13:45.080]   The pediatrician happened to be standing right outside the doors
[01:13:45.080 --> 01:13:49.880]   He summoned nurses who raced down cut the umbilical card over the car's front seat
[01:13:49.880 --> 01:13:52.840]   baby healthy mother healthy
[01:13:52.840 --> 01:13:55.720]   And car made it
[01:13:55.720 --> 01:13:59.640]   The first he he said he had to do some major cleaning to the car
[01:14:01.160 --> 01:14:05.080]   Hey, who cares, you know, that's fine. That's why you get the leather seats. Yeah
[01:14:05.080 --> 01:14:09.640]   That the birth apparently was flawless
[01:14:09.640 --> 01:14:17.000]   uh, and um, you know they the the family of four made it to the hospital thanks to the tesla driving them there
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:19.480]   So they're calling it the first
[01:14:19.480 --> 01:14:26.040]   Tesla self-driving baby. They considered briefly though. She I think quite properly vetoed this
[01:14:26.680 --> 01:14:33.080]   Using the middle name tes. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, they're gonna call her mave mave lily
[01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:35.880]   Obviously westworld fans
[01:14:35.880 --> 01:14:44.520]   Uh, that's pretty cool. That's pretty cool. It is pretty cool. Yeah, nice family. It's so dangerous because we know it's not good
[01:14:44.520 --> 01:14:48.280]   I know well, he's not cool. What are you gonna do if you're if you're in that position
[01:14:48.280 --> 01:14:55.480]   You put it over just like everybody's done since the car was invented. They did it in buggies
[01:14:56.280 --> 01:15:00.280]   You just pull over you call 911 you have the baby
[01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:06.120]   But we're but we're almost there. We're almost there. Watch the gps honey and breathe
[01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:13.720]   But can you can you go a little lighter in my hand? Can you look on my head a little bit the case of the self-driving baby
[01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:18.280]   They should they really should have known name your test. I think that sounds like I said
[01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:22.040]   Why are you 10 to 1 10 to 1 nickname? That's what she gets called right?
[01:15:22.440 --> 01:15:27.720]   So this is the tiktok story you put in here from the verge tiktok kitchens
[01:15:27.720 --> 01:15:31.080]   so, uh, you know, I have a little bit of a
[01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:33.800]   self-interest uh
[01:15:33.800 --> 01:15:40.840]   Conflict of interest with this one because my son is on tiktok with 1.7 million followers. He's a tiktok chef
[01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:45.480]   but apparently uh, he picked a good time to become a tiktok chef because
[01:15:45.480 --> 01:15:47.960]   cooking is huge
[01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:49.800]   on tiktok
[01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:53.240]   and tiktok has decided to create pop-up kitchens
[01:15:53.240 --> 01:15:58.920]   With some of the creations of their content creators. This is you know all of this
[01:15:58.920 --> 01:16:06.200]   Every one of these platforms is vying to get creators to make stuff on their platform because essentially you get free content
[01:16:06.200 --> 01:16:12.680]   It's what drives the platform whether it's youtube or tiktok or snapchat or twitter or whatever or instagram
[01:16:12.680 --> 01:16:16.440]   So this is the spiff that tiktok is offering these cooks
[01:16:16.680 --> 01:16:19.880]   You know, we'll take your recipe and we'll let people order it
[01:16:19.880 --> 01:16:27.080]   They're gonna open 300 locations across the us to start but plan on expanding to 1000 by the end of next year
[01:16:27.080 --> 01:16:33.880]   They partnered with virtual dining concepts, which is uh, I guess a pop-up kitchen ghost kitchens
[01:16:33.880 --> 01:16:37.080]   Yeah, it's a ghost kitchen coming they use they use some existing restaurants. I think then they create
[01:16:37.080 --> 01:16:42.920]   Kitchen, it'll be delivery only no brand to go to it'll cook up some of the trendiest recipes on the app
[01:16:42.920 --> 01:16:48.200]   I know that henry's stuff. I'm sorry salt hanks stuff would probably be among those
[01:16:48.200 --> 01:16:51.080]   uh tiktok kitchens will operate out of
[01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:55.720]   Some existing kitchens, uh like book at a bepbo and bertouches
[01:16:55.720 --> 01:16:57.560]   Um
[01:16:57.560 --> 01:16:59.560]   Oh near me. Yeah. Yeah
[01:16:59.560 --> 01:17:06.280]   And they'll share revenue with the creators, but they don't have to right because you can't copyright a recipe
[01:17:06.280 --> 01:17:08.680]   Right. No, so
[01:17:08.680 --> 01:17:12.120]   But tiktok knows that it's about the creators
[01:17:12.520 --> 01:17:16.920]   Look at they they all they have to do is look over their shoulder at twitter and what and how they killed vine
[01:17:16.920 --> 01:17:22.200]   By not valuing the creators and they know that how easy it is to lose these people. So yes
[01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:26.920]   Yeah, they're gonna make sure so the very first menu will feature the baked feta pasta
[01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:30.600]   By the way, yeah who really wants that all right. Yeah, it was fun to watch
[01:17:30.600 --> 01:17:32.840]   I don't want to eat it fun to do. Does it look good?
[01:17:32.840 --> 01:17:35.560]   But you don't order that to brought home. I don't fix that
[01:17:35.560 --> 01:17:40.280]   Air fried strips of corn known as corn ribs, you know, they really need to talk to my son
[01:17:40.680 --> 01:17:44.760]   The crispy cheese covered pasta chips and the smash burger. These are all
[01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:49.720]   Novelty foods not good foods right you want to you want a great killer
[01:17:49.720 --> 01:17:53.720]   Yeah, uh roast beef sandwich with cheese on it and and june
[01:17:53.720 --> 01:17:59.400]   Like thank you. No what you want is to taste something crazy. This is this is a search
[01:17:59.400 --> 01:18:04.280]   This is entertainment. This is a food. All right. You're right. You're not ordering this for dinner
[01:18:04.280 --> 01:18:07.400]   This is just say hey, you gotta go. You do it once and you don't do it again
[01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:12.520]   Mr. Mr. Beast the mr. Beast burger mr. Beast the number one youtube star
[01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:17.240]   Uh vdc created a kitchen for him with the mr. Beast burger towards the end of last year
[01:18:17.240 --> 01:18:24.520]   They sold one million burgers in three months and they're now 15 me yeah and they're now 1500 kitchens throughout the us
[01:18:24.520 --> 01:18:27.080]   Canada and the uk so
[01:18:27.080 --> 01:18:33.560]   It's good time. I mean it's possible that some of this will become like part of the
[01:18:34.600 --> 01:18:37.560]   Mexican but the nice thing about ghost kitchens is you just
[01:18:37.560 --> 01:18:40.520]   They're outfitted specifically to make
[01:18:40.520 --> 01:18:44.920]   To to turn out batches of stuff and then flip. Yeah
[01:18:44.920 --> 01:18:46.920]   Yeah
[01:18:46.920 --> 01:18:51.960]   Right the the fad goes fine. You're done. Yeah, she's I could order a mr. Beast burger
[01:18:51.960 --> 01:18:56.280]   Well, you could have I don't know if the
[01:18:56.280 --> 01:18:59.800]   You should chat. No, I look a little bit bird too. She's like bring one over for you
[01:18:59.800 --> 01:19:03.320]   Your heart jeff your heart. I can only get um
[01:19:03.880 --> 01:19:06.120]   Delivery though not uh pick up
[01:19:06.120 --> 01:19:11.000]   Yes pretty far away. No, I think they don't want you to see where it's made
[01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:16.440]   The bideg up the street
[01:19:16.440 --> 01:19:23.080]   Well, I think it's probably bird two cheese for you or maybe a trailer where they make meth other days. You are you don't know
[01:19:23.080 --> 01:19:25.240]   yeah, yeah
[01:19:25.240 --> 01:19:27.240]   Uh
[01:19:27.240 --> 01:19:32.040]   We had mentioned that google TVs were yanked from best by semarily
[01:19:32.680 --> 01:19:39.720]   Uh, we we we hypothesized it's because tcl is going to be making the amazon TVs featuring the fire tv
[01:19:39.720 --> 01:19:46.520]   But tcl has resumed selling its google tv's they had to roll out some uh software fixes
[01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:50.680]   So it's just a soft problem, right? Yeah, these are actually very nice TVs
[01:19:50.680 --> 01:19:52.200]   um
[01:19:52.200 --> 01:19:55.720]   Tcl has for years offered roku built in and now they're offering
[01:19:55.720 --> 01:19:59.880]   Uh google tv built in into its six five and six
[01:20:00.520 --> 01:20:03.720]   Series apparently the software was sluggish and buggy
[01:20:03.720 --> 01:20:06.520]   And now that it's updated
[01:20:06.520 --> 01:20:08.760]   They're back on sale
[01:20:08.760 --> 01:20:11.640]   Uh, cyborg labs
[01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:15.560]   Which is google's uh, uh, data
[01:20:15.560 --> 01:20:18.120]   Foreign city, yeah
[01:20:18.120 --> 01:20:20.440]   Now folded back into google
[01:20:20.440 --> 01:20:22.920]   Dr. Raph
[01:20:22.920 --> 01:20:27.640]   Not kori doctor. Oh, uh, dan doctor. Oh, dr. Raph. Yeah, dr. Raph. Sorry
[01:20:28.680 --> 01:20:35.240]   Has health issues. Yeah, and they also you know, they were this is their ignoble retreat from activists
[01:20:35.240 --> 01:20:40.760]   Against what they were trying to be on next thingers killed rest i'm afraid. Oh dear. Yeah, I
[01:20:40.760 --> 01:20:44.200]   I still think there's very neat things to be done there, but I wish oh I totally do
[01:20:44.200 --> 01:20:46.920]   um, I do think
[01:20:46.920 --> 01:20:47.880]   I think
[01:20:47.880 --> 01:20:53.000]   Anytime we talk about smart cities you have a inherent conflict of interest between citizens who
[01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:57.560]   You know, are distrustful of data in cities that are like
[01:20:58.040 --> 01:21:04.680]   Uh, yeah, we'll do whatever we can to help get a cool service and offset some of our costs because people don't want to pay taxes
[01:21:04.680 --> 01:21:12.120]   And it's just it's a it's a nasty dynamic. I think it's also somewhat there is some i'm sorry jeff moral panic here
[01:21:12.120 --> 01:21:13.960]   Uh
[01:21:13.960 --> 01:21:19.240]   And this is the trademark leo that's my this is the tension throughout everything we cover
[01:21:19.240 --> 01:21:23.480]   Which is that data can make it better. You know, this is you know having the data
[01:21:24.920 --> 01:21:28.280]   They didn't want to share that data with others. They wanted to take that data
[01:21:28.280 --> 01:21:33.240]   But they didn't want to provide it out and that that's not cool. No, it's the city's data
[01:21:33.240 --> 01:21:35.480]   So that obviously is a non-starter
[01:21:35.480 --> 01:21:39.400]   And if they're going to be tr in transgiant about that. Yeah, it doesn't work
[01:21:39.400 --> 01:21:42.120]   but there's also this
[01:21:42.120 --> 01:21:44.920]   legitimate I understand concern of her privacy
[01:21:44.920 --> 01:21:49.720]   and and uh, I don't think there's any evidence that a city government is going to
[01:21:49.720 --> 01:21:52.120]   Protect your data any better than google would
[01:21:52.760 --> 01:21:58.520]   They would probably be worse. Yeah, probably worse. Yeah, but people don't want the big company to get it, right?
[01:21:58.520 --> 01:22:04.280]   So well, it wasn't just that they didn't want what they didn't want was google getting access to the state of when other
[01:22:04.280 --> 01:22:10.360]   Competitors couldn't come in and get access to this data. Yeah, and that but see that's an easy thing to fix
[01:22:10.360 --> 01:22:14.360]   And if google doesn't fix that then that's just then they're wrong. Yeah. Yeah, well, they google
[01:22:14.360 --> 01:22:21.800]   But to google's point they're like, why would we share this data? This is why we're doing and investing in this so we can get access to this information
[01:22:22.760 --> 01:22:25.720]   Oh, you mean they're not doing it for the public good
[01:22:25.720 --> 01:22:28.600]   Right, so you know
[01:22:28.600 --> 01:22:34.840]   Now you must have put this in because there's a question mark next to this story. Yes, I did. I have this mean anything
[01:22:34.840 --> 01:22:40.840]   I can tell you for rising in google just let me just get into the story and then you can explain it
[01:22:40.840 --> 01:22:47.400]   So my news feed because what I do is up to look at the show and irritate stacey and put things into the rundown
[01:22:48.200 --> 01:22:52.680]   Um if I go to google news and and and type in google and it's weird
[01:22:52.680 --> 01:22:56.920]   But if I go to search google for google and then click on news then I get a nice feed
[01:22:56.920 --> 01:22:59.800]   suddenly today there was kind of a
[01:22:59.800 --> 01:23:03.400]   Redesign and there were also more press releases in it, which was a little interesting
[01:23:03.400 --> 01:23:07.960]   And so I came across this one for google and verizon
[01:23:07.960 --> 01:23:11.560]   And so my mind was thinking this news story. I realized it's a press release
[01:23:11.560 --> 01:23:17.240]   But then I read it and I think what the hell does this mean? So I thought I'll ask stacey
[01:23:18.200 --> 01:23:22.280]   That's fair because it made no sense. I couldn't get any sense out of this thing
[01:23:22.280 --> 01:23:26.680]   Yeah, so what's happening is you know big picture
[01:23:26.680 --> 01:23:34.840]   Oh, did you read the headline out loud? No, I didn't Verizon and google cloud to collaborate to deliver 5g mobile edge
[01:23:34.840 --> 01:23:37.240]   computing
[01:23:37.240 --> 01:23:44.680]   To bring the power of the cloud closer to mobile and connected devices at the edge of verizon's network
[01:23:45.320 --> 01:23:52.280]   A lowercase edge in that case next paragraph google distributed cloud edge all uppercase verizon 5g edge
[01:23:52.280 --> 01:23:59.960]   It tends to bring compute and storage services to the network edge lower case e to support real-time enterprise applications
[01:23:59.960 --> 01:24:03.880]   I throw my hands. I said that I don't I have no idea what's happening. Is there anything?
[01:24:03.880 --> 01:24:08.600]   Basically what's happening? Yeah, there there is a thing happening and there's this thing is this
[01:24:08.600 --> 01:24:13.800]   One the telcos have given up on the cloud and we we saw this coming this happened in 2020
[01:24:14.120 --> 01:24:17.240]   We saw these deals microsoft has one of these with azure sorry
[01:24:17.240 --> 01:24:21.720]   AT&T has one with azure verizon has one with google and with AWS
[01:24:21.720 --> 01:24:30.200]   AT&T might have one with AWS anyway, the point is all the stuff used to happen in google and azure and
[01:24:30.200 --> 01:24:37.080]   AWS is cloud data centers right, you know the ones that keep going down
[01:24:37.080 --> 01:24:39.880]   so
[01:24:39.880 --> 01:24:40.520]   with
[01:24:40.520 --> 01:24:46.280]   5g and everything happening on your mobile devices and then this idea of like
[01:24:46.280 --> 01:24:49.080]   the edge being like inside a factory
[01:24:49.080 --> 01:24:54.040]   latency becomes important so you don't want to send your data all the way back to google's data centers
[01:24:54.040 --> 01:24:58.440]   You want to send it someplace a little closer. So verizon they have
[01:24:58.440 --> 01:25:04.760]   Little tiny data centers all over the place because they've got cell towers all over the place and at the base of those
[01:25:04.760 --> 01:25:09.880]   I've got a bunch of servers. They also have like central offices for you know the telco networks
[01:25:10.440 --> 01:25:16.360]   So now you can get access to google or amazon or any one of depending on the partnership
[01:25:16.360 --> 01:25:24.200]   They run their cloud software in verizon's data centers because it's lower latency so
[01:25:24.200 --> 01:25:26.280]   Oh, so what is it's it's like it's like
[01:25:26.280 --> 01:25:32.440]   What's the what's the company with the Hawaiian name that puts everything at all servers around the country the world?
[01:25:32.440 --> 01:25:35.000]   Akabai
[01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:42.040]   So a sponsor by the way, a lot of off so you so it is near the edge. It is literally physically around their network
[01:25:42.040 --> 01:25:46.600]   It is physically on their network. It's a little different. So akabai only does
[01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:49.480]   Well, they've they've expanded but they
[01:25:49.480 --> 01:25:52.200]   This is a new service google's cloud software
[01:25:52.200 --> 01:25:59.160]   So basically you if you build something designed for like amazon or google's cloud you're you're using certain services
[01:25:59.160 --> 01:26:02.280]   You don't have to change anything about your
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:10.440]   Application to run it now a little closer because it's going to run on those same services located god. Okay now makes sense
[01:26:10.440 --> 01:26:15.480]   Thank you stacey. I knew you would know. I don't know if it's worth talking about but I just didn't configure it like a
[01:26:15.480 --> 01:26:19.960]   Well, we throw that term around so it's good to explain it
[01:26:19.960 --> 01:26:24.200]   I think I was gonna say the biggest deal with the edge and you're gonna hear this this will be a
[01:26:24.200 --> 01:26:28.280]   Point of contention for like the next few years is people be like the edge
[01:26:28.760 --> 01:26:33.480]   and there's the the telco edge, which is what these people are talking about there's the
[01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:38.120]   you know edge edge, which is usually like a gateway device like a
[01:26:38.120 --> 01:26:41.080]   Just a server that's sitting in like a factory floor
[01:26:41.080 --> 01:26:45.400]   And then there's what a lot of the cloud companies called the farthest edge
[01:26:45.400 --> 01:26:49.480]   Which is actually where I'm most excited which is actually the devices themselves
[01:26:49.480 --> 01:26:51.800]   and so when
[01:26:51.800 --> 01:26:57.800]   What i'm actually really excited about is what the cloud guys call the farthest edge is the most interesting place
[01:26:58.120 --> 01:27:02.200]   Because that's where you're seeing a lot of really cool innovation happen with distributed computing
[01:27:02.200 --> 01:27:05.080]   And you're seeing a bunch of startups arise
[01:27:05.080 --> 01:27:07.720]   trying to make it
[01:27:07.720 --> 01:27:14.440]   So you can actually do an ad hoc distributed computing kind of system
[01:27:14.440 --> 01:27:19.560]   And that's going to be awesome because then you don't have to send stuff back to the cloud
[01:27:19.560 --> 01:27:23.240]   There's going to be more data privacy. There's going to be lower latencies
[01:27:23.880 --> 01:27:29.240]   It's going to be really cool, but nobody yet has a dog in that hunt except these startups
[01:27:29.240 --> 01:27:32.280]   And so you get a lot of like the big guys kind of like
[01:27:32.280 --> 01:27:34.840]   Calling things that's the edge that aren't really the edge
[01:27:34.840 --> 01:27:38.440]   And you're going to start seeing the big guys buy companies here
[01:27:38.440 --> 01:27:43.000]   As they realize their container strategy is going to ultimately fail for the iot
[01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:47.400]   So like next three years or so that's going to be a huge
[01:27:47.400 --> 01:27:50.280]   Thing to think about like a big macro picture
[01:27:50.280 --> 01:27:53.400]   And what does this have to do with microsoft's edge browser?
[01:27:54.280 --> 01:27:56.280]   Nothing
[01:27:56.280 --> 01:28:05.000]   Actually speaking of browsers chrome 100
[01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:12.120]   Which is that's a major landmark. What is chrome currently is it 96 97? We're getting close
[01:28:12.120 --> 01:28:15.960]   Chrome is set to reach virgin 100
[01:28:15.960 --> 01:28:18.760]   but
[01:28:18.760 --> 01:28:22.840]   Apparently it's according to the chromium bug tracker
[01:28:23.320 --> 01:28:25.320]   It's going to break some websites
[01:28:25.320 --> 01:28:27.880]   Uh
[01:28:27.880 --> 01:28:33.240]   Yeah, the websites that are known to be affected are primarily those developed with a web design kit called
[01:28:33.240 --> 01:28:35.560]   duda
[01:28:35.560 --> 01:28:40.440]   Or duda these websites all use the same bit of code to check what version of chrome you're using
[01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:44.840]   They're used to two digits. This is kind of like a mini y2k
[01:28:44.840 --> 01:28:50.120]   But three digits
[01:28:51.400 --> 01:28:53.400]   I don't know what the hell that is
[01:28:53.400 --> 01:29:01.240]   I don't know what the hell it is. That's uh, I love how people just make the same mistakes over and over and over again
[01:29:01.240 --> 01:29:05.000]   So duda blocks automatically any version of chrome below 40
[01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:09.240]   However, when you get to 100 if you only look at the
[01:29:09.240 --> 01:29:14.200]   If only look at the uh first two digits
[01:29:14.200 --> 01:29:18.760]   It it looks like chrome 10 and it will be blocked
[01:29:19.880 --> 01:29:21.880]   and uh, so there uh
[01:29:21.880 --> 01:29:28.840]   So something's going to have to give I think they'll figure out a way around this but uh, anyway
[01:29:28.840 --> 01:29:38.920]   This is so stupid one one solution is to add a flag to chrome colon slash slash flags
[01:29:38.920 --> 01:29:43.480]   That will be able to give you the chance to test whether a site will be affected
[01:29:43.480 --> 01:29:47.720]   Uh, and it looks it'll let you put the major version
[01:29:48.280 --> 01:29:51.400]   100 in the minor version position
[01:29:51.400 --> 01:29:54.120]   In user agent, huh?
[01:29:54.120 --> 01:30:02.040]   So instead of saying chrome 100 dot whatever dot zero, it'll say chrome 99 dot 100
[01:30:02.040 --> 01:30:06.680]   You thereby bypassing it. That's ridiculous, but
[01:30:06.680 --> 01:30:13.240]   That's what we have to do sometimes. That is the world we live in. That's the world we live in as life is a cluge
[01:30:13.240 --> 01:30:15.880]   Yeah, what a cluge is that crazy
[01:30:17.080 --> 01:30:22.920]   Uh, it's time for speaking of the edge time to go off the edge with our nft segment
[01:30:22.920 --> 01:30:26.280]   Melania trump planning to launch
[01:30:26.280 --> 01:30:30.440]   her new nft platform and of course
[01:30:30.440 --> 01:30:33.400]   It's it's intent is to inspire
[01:30:33.400 --> 01:30:36.280]   It's it's all about the inspiration
[01:30:36.280 --> 01:30:38.120]   Uh
[01:30:38.120 --> 01:30:42.600]   President donald trump once called bitcoin is scammed that competed against the dollar
[01:30:43.080 --> 01:30:45.080]   Because everything's a competition
[01:30:45.080 --> 01:30:52.600]   But on thursday melania announced a new business venture embracing cryptocurrency and digital art a platform to sell nft's
[01:30:52.600 --> 01:30:55.480]   This is the first thing she's done since leaving the white house
[01:30:55.480 --> 01:30:58.600]   Um
[01:30:58.600 --> 01:31:03.080]   I don't sure who's nft's well, I guess I do know
[01:31:03.080 --> 01:31:10.040]   The first nft offering is a watercolor depiction of melani is cobalt blue eyes
[01:31:10.760 --> 01:31:12.760]   It's called melani is vision
[01:31:12.760 --> 01:31:18.040]   Uh as a collector if you buy the nft you'll get an amulet to inspire
[01:31:18.040 --> 01:31:20.920]   Each nft will cost $187
[01:31:20.920 --> 01:31:24.040]   Next month
[01:31:24.040 --> 01:31:29.320]   She'll offer nft's in a quote one of a kind auction of historical importance
[01:31:29.320 --> 01:31:36.200]   That will include digital artwork physical artwork and a physical one of a kind accessory by the way
[01:31:36.200 --> 01:31:38.200]   That's the hot new thing right now
[01:31:38.200 --> 01:31:40.520]   um
[01:31:40.520 --> 01:31:47.880]   Tom tom brady just sold 1.3 million in nft's he's a quarterback for the tampa bay bucket ears and the greatest of all time
[01:31:47.880 --> 01:31:53.960]   Uh, he's he auctioned off not possession of but an nft of his old college cleats
[01:31:53.960 --> 01:31:57.240]   His college resume and I think
[01:31:57.240 --> 01:32:01.960]   I think you get a little thing a little token that you can hang around your neck
[01:32:01.960 --> 01:32:03.160]   um
[01:32:03.160 --> 01:32:09.240]   Can I do an nft of the the the memo that rejected an entertainment weekly or yes?
[01:32:10.120 --> 01:32:12.120]   absolutely
[01:32:12.120 --> 01:32:14.040]   Absolutely
[01:32:14.040 --> 01:32:16.440]   It's if somebody will buy it do it
[01:32:16.440 --> 01:32:17.960]   uh
[01:32:17.960 --> 01:32:19.560]   According to uh
[01:32:19.560 --> 01:32:27.400]   The former first lady a portion of the proceeds unspecified what portion portion? I don't know we're gonna give him a penny
[01:32:27.400 --> 01:32:31.160]   I don't know will assist children aging out of the foster care system
[01:32:31.160 --> 01:32:34.280]   um
[01:32:34.280 --> 01:32:36.520]   So there you go
[01:32:36.520 --> 01:32:38.840]   And by the way it speaks
[01:32:39.800 --> 01:32:45.480]   It speaks it speaks the nft speaks it says something yes, she says something
[01:32:45.480 --> 01:32:51.720]   Does it say be best be best please please let it say be best be best
[01:32:51.720 --> 01:32:57.800]   Uh, it says something that's just pure pep. I can't remember what it was and I I had it before
[01:32:57.800 --> 01:33:04.680]   Oh, I wish I I'm looking at the wall's washington post a story about this. Um, anyway
[01:33:04.680 --> 01:33:08.520]   It's interesting a few
[01:33:09.320 --> 01:33:14.920]   Okay, that's fine. You know, okay. We don't really know we don't know. We're moving on
[01:33:14.920 --> 01:33:17.720]   Okay
[01:33:17.720 --> 01:33:21.000]   A deep if we had the audio if you find the audio, I'll play it
[01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:26.280]   No, no, no, I guess only you only get the audio if you buy the nft it brings back terrible memories
[01:33:26.280 --> 01:33:33.160]   Uh adidas is revealing a new nft project with the board ap yacht club
[01:33:35.160 --> 01:33:39.480]   This is I just sometimes I feel like I don't know what this world is that I'm living in but it's nothing
[01:33:39.480 --> 01:33:44.200]   I this makes me feel old in a way that nothing else in my life has
[01:33:44.200 --> 01:33:46.840]   I know but I don't think it's age
[01:33:46.840 --> 01:33:53.480]   I have a teenage daughter. The board but the nft part is not age. It's aging bros who love that stuff
[01:33:53.480 --> 01:33:59.240]   The board ap yacht club in which membership is granted by owning one of 10,000
[01:33:59.240 --> 01:34:01.960]   profile pictures of board apes
[01:34:02.760 --> 01:34:05.880]   The nft's cost at least 200,000 a piece
[01:34:05.880 --> 01:34:07.880]   um
[01:34:07.880 --> 01:34:09.320]   and adidas
[01:34:09.320 --> 01:34:13.400]   Apparently purchased adidas clad ape named indigo hertz
[01:34:13.400 --> 01:34:18.360]   Then there's this g money guy. I know it's just I can't
[01:34:18.360 --> 01:34:24.200]   It's just you know, I just read it and it's just I glaze over it's like me and that press release
[01:34:24.200 --> 01:34:29.000]   Yeah, the Verizon press yeah, we don't have anybody here to explain it. I know
[01:34:31.320 --> 01:34:35.480]   And your eyes may have still glazed over which would have been totally fine. It's not exciting
[01:34:35.480 --> 01:34:40.520]   the world's very first text message is now an nft and get this
[01:34:40.520 --> 01:34:46.760]   It sold for $150,000 at a paris auction house
[01:34:46.760 --> 01:34:51.080]   Uh, this is what you get which is a picture of a phone
[01:34:51.080 --> 01:34:57.000]   With the sms on it. So who had the right citizens to sell that?
[01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:00.280]   um
[01:35:01.160 --> 01:35:04.440]   That's a good question. Like cousin richan jarvis though. That's yeah
[01:35:04.440 --> 01:35:08.200]   So the the first text message was set in december 3rd
[01:35:08.200 --> 01:35:11.320]   1992 so we just missed the anniversary
[01:35:11.320 --> 01:35:13.800]   Remind me next year
[01:35:13.800 --> 01:35:19.160]   To we could celebrate the 30th anniversary of the first text message. It said mary christmas
[01:35:19.160 --> 01:35:24.840]   It was sent by british programmer niel pappworth to richard jarvis director of
[01:35:24.840 --> 01:35:27.320]   vodafone
[01:35:27.320 --> 01:35:33.160]   Uh jarvis received the message on his orbitel 901 cell phone at the company's christmas party
[01:35:33.160 --> 01:35:36.040]   the nft itself is a replica
[01:35:36.040 --> 01:35:42.520]   Of the original communication protocol that transmitted the sms
[01:35:42.520 --> 01:35:46.680]   The unknown buyer who has to pay in uh, eth
[01:35:46.680 --> 01:35:53.320]   Will receive a digital frame with a 3d animation of the message being received
[01:35:53.320 --> 01:35:56.440]   I guess it's I guess it's pappworth
[01:35:57.240 --> 01:35:59.240]   Who sold it
[01:35:59.240 --> 01:36:01.400]   um
[01:36:01.400 --> 01:36:11.160]   Uh, you know just weird I recently told my children that I sent the first text they said dad you can make a fortune
[01:36:11.160 --> 01:36:13.800]   Oh lord
[01:36:13.800 --> 01:36:19.400]   Uh wikipedia co-founder jimmy wales has sold the nft of the first ever edit made on wikipedia
[01:36:19.400 --> 01:36:23.000]   Right which pissed off for some wikipedia ends but the paper
[01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.960]   um
[01:36:25.960 --> 01:36:27.960]   That's good
[01:36:27.960 --> 01:36:29.320]   the
[01:36:29.320 --> 01:36:30.920]   so uh
[01:36:30.920 --> 01:36:34.280]   The fun part is on twitter all the time people people fighting about
[01:36:34.280 --> 01:36:38.440]   nft's and web 3 and nobody knows what anybody else is talking about
[01:36:38.440 --> 01:36:43.160]   But when I go to academic things they spend the first half of the day explaining terms
[01:36:43.160 --> 01:36:46.200]   Yeah, but but nobody knows what these terms mean. Yeah
[01:36:46.200 --> 01:36:51.400]   Well, they think they do but everybody's saying different things to each other and then they're arguing about it
[01:36:51.560 --> 01:36:55.880]   And I can't get my head into it. It's like you're in an eternal clubhouse loop
[01:36:55.880 --> 01:37:04.360]   I'm I'm trying to read and I haven't finished it yet, but did y'all read timmer Riley's thing on web 3? No
[01:37:04.360 --> 01:37:07.640]   It's an open tab stacy. It's an open tab
[01:37:07.640 --> 01:37:12.200]   It's an oh, yeah, that's I'm like it's an open tab that i'm getting to as soon as i'm done with my emails
[01:37:12.200 --> 01:37:15.080]   So maybe next week or
[01:37:15.080 --> 01:37:17.080]   Yeah, everybody sit there for a while but
[01:37:19.560 --> 01:37:24.200]   Because we think about a web 2.0 itself was heuristic of a sort
[01:37:24.200 --> 01:37:30.920]   Like oh, we already finished a web. We know what the next one is. We are the third one. Um, no, it may be web
[01:37:30.920 --> 01:37:33.960]   Dot 0 0 1
[01:37:33.960 --> 01:37:35.960]   We're early in this thing
[01:37:35.960 --> 01:37:40.200]   Let me uh, let me do the google change log and then we can um
[01:37:40.200 --> 01:37:43.880]   We can get your pics of the week because it was like you guys
[01:37:43.880 --> 01:37:47.560]   It's painful
[01:37:47.560 --> 01:37:49.560]   This is painful
[01:37:49.560 --> 01:37:57.560]   So you remember last week we all got severe weather alerts for a cyclone coming to the philippines
[01:37:57.560 --> 01:38:01.720]   I guess there is a fix which is essentially
[01:38:01.720 --> 01:38:08.040]   They've turned off severe weather alerts in the pixel launcher's at a glance widget just completely disabled
[01:38:08.040 --> 01:38:10.440]   That's one way to fix something
[01:38:10.440 --> 01:38:16.040]   Uh google is when the snow hits seattle later this week. I'm not going to get a notification
[01:38:16.040 --> 01:38:19.800]   Well, you might but you just won't get it through that widget if you use the at a glance widget
[01:38:19.800 --> 01:38:23.240]   You might get a notification your phone in other ways. You probably will
[01:38:23.240 --> 01:38:27.320]   Um, yay
[01:38:27.320 --> 01:38:29.880]   Uh, no one's saying google hasn't said
[01:38:29.880 --> 01:38:35.640]   But nine to five google noticed that that they've been the severe weather alerts have been disabled
[01:38:35.640 --> 01:38:38.520]   And you can't re-enable them so
[01:38:38.520 --> 01:38:41.080]   Hmm
[01:38:41.080 --> 01:38:43.000]   That's a change right that counts
[01:38:44.520 --> 01:38:48.120]   Google is turning if you've got an on hub router
[01:38:48.120 --> 01:38:54.440]   Now i'm not even a fan of the of the current google wi-fi routers, but i don't remember these on hubs this goes back
[01:38:54.440 --> 01:38:59.800]   People people did buy them. I think kevin used to have them many many years ago. Yeah
[01:38:59.800 --> 01:39:01.560]   Um
[01:39:01.560 --> 01:39:08.280]   Yeah, they're turning off the controls. So this is an example of uh an iot device that doesn't actually work
[01:39:08.280 --> 01:39:11.000]   Without support from the company
[01:39:11.560 --> 01:39:14.920]   Uh, although you know most routers that we're used to too
[01:39:14.920 --> 01:39:18.040]   They're just a box. It's a computer in a box
[01:39:18.040 --> 01:39:22.440]   But these on hub routers apparently need support from a google server that will be
[01:39:22.440 --> 01:39:26.120]   lights out uh
[01:39:26.120 --> 01:39:28.120]   December 19th
[01:39:28.120 --> 01:39:32.280]   Yeah, well most of our round happens is already did that's a couple of days ago
[01:39:32.280 --> 01:39:35.080]   Yeah
[01:39:35.080 --> 01:39:38.920]   But they did give you a discount a 40 off discount on the nest
[01:39:39.960 --> 01:39:45.400]   Google wi-fi routers if you want those I would not recommend them. No, I wouldn't either
[01:39:45.400 --> 01:39:48.040]   And I think those recommend these days
[01:39:48.040 --> 01:39:56.520]   Well, you rose good. I like the eros. I like the um orbeez. That's exactly so scott wilkins at me. That's the two I recommended
[01:39:56.520 --> 01:40:00.760]   TP link has some good ones too. There's a problem in uh
[01:40:00.760 --> 01:40:03.080]   TP link
[01:40:03.080 --> 01:40:07.320]   Apparently is setting up a invisible wi-fi public wi-fi network
[01:40:08.280 --> 01:40:10.280]   Uh on some of its routers
[01:40:10.280 --> 01:40:15.160]   You know, we get all up in arms about that every single time someone does it, but you know
[01:40:15.160 --> 01:40:24.360]   Comcast has it all the isp's have their little fake Wi-fi network or their public Wi-fi is on existing cars. Yeah, um, we've seen it
[01:40:24.360 --> 01:40:27.720]   From I can't think of the company right now
[01:40:27.720 --> 01:40:34.200]   I mean, I'm not saying that you know if that's not your jam then don't I think this one you can't turn off
[01:40:34.200 --> 01:40:40.360]   But I think they're gonna fix that by adding that feature in a in a firmware. You're automatically opted in
[01:40:40.360 --> 01:40:43.640]   Yeah, just like Amazon sidewalk network kind of like that
[01:40:43.640 --> 01:40:50.360]   Hey, I like this new rules for incoming voice calls if you use google voice
[01:40:50.360 --> 01:40:53.400]   You can now control
[01:40:53.400 --> 01:40:55.880]   who gets forwarded
[01:40:55.880 --> 01:40:58.280]   You could forward calls from specific
[01:40:58.680 --> 01:41:04.680]   Contacts to linked phone numbers or directly to voicemail. So if you decide I don't want to get any more calls from jeff jarvis
[01:41:04.680 --> 01:41:07.160]   Send them straight to voicemail by person
[01:41:07.160 --> 01:41:11.720]   You can opt and go ahead groups in your contacts
[01:41:11.720 --> 01:41:17.320]   So if you actually like I'm like sitting here thinking oh if I had actually labeled all the pr people in my contacts as pr people
[01:41:17.320 --> 01:41:19.320]   I could be like yeah
[01:41:19.320 --> 01:41:25.240]   Miss mail. Yeah, you could set custom voicemail greetings for specific contacts used to be able to do that for groups
[01:41:25.240 --> 01:41:27.320]   I mean you can't do that for groups
[01:41:27.720 --> 01:41:34.360]   I remember it kind of puzzled my family when I said hi. This is leo. I can't take your call right now leave a message. I love you
[01:41:34.360 --> 01:41:42.120]   Jennifer said do you say that to everybody who calls? He said no no it knows it's you it knows it's you
[01:41:42.120 --> 01:41:51.320]   You just call yourself leo? Well for my family. That's my real name. That's the name I use. Yeah. Oh, oh, I just was wondering about that
[01:41:51.320 --> 01:41:53.640]   I'm gil
[01:41:55.160 --> 01:42:01.320]   We can call you leo you could call you leo. I like leo. It's very classy. Yeah, it's le exante
[01:42:01.320 --> 01:42:04.360]   Goo over the e a qdex and over the eo
[01:42:04.360 --> 01:42:09.800]   It was the bane of my childhood because you know, I mean, you know, right a kid with a
[01:42:09.800 --> 01:42:12.680]   Diocritical mark on
[01:42:12.680 --> 01:42:16.600]   It's leo what the hell so when I got into radio
[01:42:16.600 --> 01:42:23.000]   Um for a while I used a phony name. I was Dave allen and dan haze, but when I got the radio in san francisco
[01:42:23.800 --> 01:42:29.080]   Um, I said I would like to use my real name now and my program director said well, what's your real name?
[01:42:29.080 --> 01:42:32.920]   I said it's leo la port and he said that sounds good. You can't use that
[01:42:32.920 --> 01:42:35.800]   San Francisco
[01:42:35.800 --> 01:42:37.400]   What are you talking about?
[01:42:37.400 --> 01:42:38.360]   so
[01:42:38.360 --> 01:42:44.120]   So I said well my and the driver's license is spelled leo. I could just say leo and they said that's fine
[01:42:44.120 --> 01:42:46.680]   much more manly
[01:42:46.680 --> 01:42:49.240]   So but so
[01:42:49.240 --> 01:42:53.800]   You lay on the port. I love that name. I love that. Oh, but it's classy
[01:42:53.800 --> 01:43:00.440]   I guess it's too fancy. Yeah, if you want to call me leo do leeza. It's funny because
[01:43:00.440 --> 01:43:06.040]   I tell leeza you should call me leo. That's my name and i'm your husband. You can call me my real name now
[01:43:06.040 --> 01:43:09.080]   But she she alternates back and forth
[01:43:09.080 --> 01:43:12.360]   Because you know at work she calls me leo and
[01:43:12.360 --> 01:43:14.920]   Yeah, anyway, so
[01:43:14.920 --> 01:43:16.920]   I am leo and so
[01:43:16.920 --> 01:43:21.160]   That's why I said that on my that's the thing they got a custom message because they knew
[01:43:21.160 --> 01:43:26.920]   Who I was I grabbed onto that. That's what yes jack Russell terrier out of forces
[01:43:26.920 --> 01:43:32.680]   Optic screen calls from specific context so you can really go person by person
[01:43:32.680 --> 01:43:36.440]   Uh, ply rules for all your contacts or specific groups within your context
[01:43:36.440 --> 01:43:37.320]   This is great
[01:43:37.320 --> 01:43:41.560]   I hope they can that google file will get this because when I got five as you did too
[01:43:41.560 --> 01:43:46.680]   You gave up your google voice phone number to your fine number and I think you lose some of the
[01:43:47.160 --> 01:43:52.040]   Features of that now of course they're giving google voice new new features. So that's cool
[01:43:52.040 --> 01:43:55.800]   Brand new there's your that's a change
[01:43:55.800 --> 01:43:59.400]   And the home mini
[01:43:59.400 --> 01:44:02.040]   They finally stopped selling it
[01:44:02.040 --> 01:44:04.360]   This is that's the little google home
[01:44:04.360 --> 01:44:09.400]   Faber colored google home, which was the least expensive about that should have run the list of things killed
[01:44:09.400 --> 01:44:16.280]   Yeah, I think that's a great little product the nest mini replaced it. So it's really there is still a mini
[01:44:16.280 --> 01:44:17.160]   but
[01:44:17.160 --> 01:44:21.160]   What is the nest mini look like let's go to the store and find out?
[01:44:21.160 --> 01:44:24.120]   store.google
[01:44:24.120 --> 01:44:25.960]   Dot com
[01:44:25.960 --> 01:44:30.920]   Sorry, I'm just like wait. There's there's another small one the nest mini second generation
[01:44:30.920 --> 01:44:37.000]   It's even more. It looks just the same thing. It's similar. Yeah, it's another googly branding
[01:44:37.000 --> 01:44:39.880]   Well, but it's got the little lights on
[01:44:41.480 --> 01:44:48.200]   Yeah, so they I think it's is an entirely fabric colored. I recovered. I can't tell no, but a lot of 3d color
[01:44:48.200 --> 01:44:53.160]   Is opposed to load 3d image. It's no longer a 67 falcon
[01:44:53.160 --> 01:45:04.600]   Okay, I was to say I guess not two-tone. I guess I get what you're saying now
[01:45:05.080 --> 01:45:12.840]   But it's not yeah, I am too. It's not too tone. So I didn't realize they still were selling the version called the home mini. Yeah, yeah
[01:45:12.840 --> 01:45:15.560]   That's interesting
[01:45:15.560 --> 01:45:19.720]   Trying to see where they would sell that I
[01:45:19.720 --> 01:45:26.200]   Don't know, but you can get the you can get the nest mini for 25 bucks. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's why it's important
[01:45:26.200 --> 01:45:30.520]   They I think they still sell these inexpensive ones. They have to compete with Amazon echoes
[01:45:31.560 --> 01:45:34.680]   And they sound is very good on them. They're better than the echoes. They sound fine
[01:45:34.680 --> 01:45:40.760]   I I think Google speakers. I prefer their sound to me echo sounds me too
[01:45:40.760 --> 01:45:44.600]   and that's
[01:45:44.600 --> 01:45:49.000]   All together
[01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:51.000]   Tunkaded out of nothing
[01:45:51.000 --> 01:45:55.080]   Nothing string and chewing gum change log. Yeah

[01:49:30.280 --> 01:49:36.520]   Um, they're kidding good presence. Just privacy first people. How about a lexus with a bow on it?
[01:49:37.560 --> 01:49:39.880]   Yeah, that's not happening. I'm trying to think of
[01:49:39.880 --> 01:49:44.120]   I know what I got a

[01:55:21.160 --> 01:55:25.000]   That is really neat. So this is
[01:55:25.000 --> 01:55:29.240]   Right now still under believe it or not still under copyright. Yeah, it's amazing
[01:55:29.240 --> 01:55:34.200]   That's uh screwed up our copyright. Yeah, this goes on and on movies entering the public domain
[01:55:34.200 --> 01:55:38.680]   What the german expression is classic foused foused

[01:55:58.200 --> 01:56:01.800]   from the library of congress
[01:56:01.800 --> 01:56:10.440]   It really feels like that's why you need to read that's old timey. That's great. Yes. That's why you need to read
[01:56:10.440 --> 01:56:17.480]   Uh matthew kirk christian bombs bit streams the future of digital literary motorcy heritage because it's kind of about just that

[01:56:57.240 --> 01:57:05.240]   Because uh, there's no recording. That's the composition. Yes a piece of music. Yes, because there are of course two distinct copyrights
[01:57:05.240 --> 01:57:07.560]   Performance and pre-
[01:57:07.560 --> 01:57:10.680]   Right, right. So this is public domain time
[01:57:11.080 --> 01:57:17.800]   I I love this and this is all because congress has neglected for the last few years to extend copyright
[01:57:17.800 --> 01:57:23.560]   Uh, which they normally do in honor of micky mouse every few years
[01:57:23.560 --> 01:57:25.960]   In honor of the
[01:57:25.960 --> 01:57:32.520]   So, um, that's great and public domain is so important and uh, oh
[01:57:32.520 --> 01:57:40.280]   Yeah, speaking of public domain. Here's a good book if you guys have time over the holidays. It is
[01:57:41.080 --> 01:57:45.640]   Otto pensler did an anthology an espionage anthology book
[01:57:45.640 --> 01:57:51.160]   It's the great big book of espionage and it is such
[01:57:51.160 --> 01:57:57.640]   Like incredibly old stories and the intro to each story and then the intro to the book takes a
[01:57:57.640 --> 01:58:02.440]   really thorough look at the history of spy novels and
[01:58:02.440 --> 01:58:07.640]   Oh, this is eflemming eric ambler. These are these are classics
[01:58:08.520 --> 01:58:16.520]   So it but it goes it's classic all the way up. He does such a it's he's very educated in the history of these books
[01:58:16.520 --> 01:58:21.400]   So he take it's like a it's like a college level course of like the history. It's great
[01:58:21.400 --> 01:58:26.440]   It's excellent. I will tell you if you get it on audible. It is 48 hours
[01:58:26.440 --> 01:58:31.400]   That's a lot of spy novels, but I am going to put it on my audible because um
[01:58:31.400 --> 01:58:34.280]   I would love this
[01:58:34.280 --> 01:58:38.280]   I mean, it's really well-thoughtable. Yeah, you want a great audible recommendation?
[01:58:38.760 --> 01:58:40.760]   Sure. Oh for it
[01:58:40.760 --> 01:58:45.400]   The layman trilogy, which is on broadway now limited term big deal
[01:58:45.400 --> 01:58:49.800]   It's actually it's written in essentially unstructured free verse
[01:58:49.800 --> 01:58:53.720]   History of the layman bank from the beginning to the oh wow
[01:58:53.720 --> 01:58:59.400]   Creatively written in ways. I can't begin to describe performed beautifully
[01:58:59.400 --> 01:59:06.840]   uh in this in this um recording and and and it's wonderful. I just bought the library
[01:59:07.800 --> 01:59:14.760]   They recommended so I don't know I just wrote about that the library of fragile history by Andrew pedigree
[01:59:14.760 --> 01:59:17.240]   But if you think the layman
[01:59:17.240 --> 01:59:23.080]   Well, I think the library is also working. They're very very very different. Well now I have the 40 hour big book of espionage
[01:59:23.080 --> 01:59:25.720]   That's the best of it
[01:59:25.720 --> 01:59:30.600]   If you go to my medium feed i'm going to plug a rare plug here if you go to my medium page after arborist.medium.com
[01:59:30.600 --> 01:59:33.240]   I have two new posts
[01:59:33.480 --> 01:59:42.200]   One is about the library and about bit streams and the continue. Uh, I saw in them about about how everything is processed and everything is a conversation. Nice
[01:59:42.200 --> 01:59:44.040]   So
[01:59:44.040 --> 01:59:49.480]   And that library what library is this I don't know what it is. I just stole the photo, but it's magnificent. Isn't it? Yeah
[01:59:49.480 --> 01:59:52.920]   Uh, I saw that photo because somebody said
[01:59:52.920 --> 01:59:59.800]   He or she was being rushed out by security guard wondering why I want to want to take a picture of that
[02:00:01.560 --> 02:00:04.680]   What are you doing here? Why would you want to take a picture of a library?
[02:00:04.680 --> 02:00:08.280]   That guy escorted me out baffled by someone was secret to building to take this picture. Yes
[02:00:08.280 --> 02:00:11.400]   I would I would like to know what the library is uh
[02:00:11.400 --> 02:00:18.600]   The uh the famous library the milk abbey in austria is the model for uh
[02:00:18.600 --> 02:00:24.920]   Uh, was it the library in the name of the rose? I think so, but anyway
[02:00:24.920 --> 02:00:28.840]   One of the great things i love libraries i agree in devettavans
[02:00:29.320 --> 02:00:34.280]   The library of fragile history at the beginning of course they start with the library in allesandria because you have to right
[02:00:34.280 --> 02:00:39.960]   And the funny thing was when nixon went to allesandria in a triumphed tour of egypt
[02:00:39.960 --> 02:00:42.440]   He asked to see the library
[02:00:42.440 --> 02:00:46.440]   Yes
[02:00:46.440 --> 02:00:51.080]   And uh, what was the response? Well, the thing was they didn't even know where one
[02:00:51.080 --> 02:00:55.720]   Where it had been burned down a few years ago, uh mr
[02:00:55.720 --> 02:01:02.040]   Nixon but a fascinating little tidbit here from the book is that is that because they were papyrus scrolls
[02:01:02.040 --> 02:01:07.000]   pedigree in devettavans said that they would have had to have been copied every century or two
[02:01:07.000 --> 02:01:13.480]   Crumbled of their own accord interesting and and the larger the library got the more impossible that became
[02:01:13.480 --> 02:01:21.800]   So scale was sought after and also a curse. Yeah all the way back then. Yeah. Wow. That's fascinating
[02:01:21.800 --> 02:01:25.400]   um
[02:01:25.400 --> 02:01:27.400]   Okay
[02:01:27.400 --> 02:01:31.960]   So the public domain that's good. Did you want to do the internet hall of fame inductees too because that's good
[02:01:31.960 --> 02:01:38.040]   We could yeah, I I never much liked awards and things like that, but I wondered how many of these names you know
[02:01:38.040 --> 02:01:40.520]   I didn't know many of them
[02:01:40.520 --> 02:01:42.760]   Uh, let's go through them coming up
[02:01:42.760 --> 02:01:47.720]   Uh carlos alfonso advanced internet development in brazil
[02:01:47.720 --> 02:01:52.040]   Bob bloxill the uh from the netherlands
[02:01:53.000 --> 02:01:55.560]   See these are all so hans verner brown
[02:01:55.560 --> 02:01:59.560]   designed the national science foundation network nsf net
[02:01:59.560 --> 02:02:06.280]   on the us for the grisen from denmark who founded the e bone which is
[02:02:06.280 --> 02:02:10.760]   Not what you think it is, but the european internet backbone. That's a solid that just went into
[02:02:10.760 --> 02:02:13.640]   The e bone
[02:02:13.640 --> 02:02:14.840]   To the bone
[02:02:14.840 --> 02:02:20.680]   Jan gruntorad from the checker public champion of networking for research and development in checkles levakia
[02:02:21.240 --> 02:02:23.240]   saul han
[02:02:23.240 --> 02:02:25.480]   Caribbean
[02:02:25.480 --> 02:02:29.960]   None of them. No. Oh, yeah, dan kaminski who passed away this year. That's the one
[02:02:29.960 --> 02:02:34.440]   That's the one I know who of course created the dns system actually no
[02:02:34.440 --> 02:02:38.760]   He's repaired the dns system when he found the kaminski bug
[02:02:38.760 --> 02:02:45.800]   Um, yeah, he's the only one I think on this whole list, but that's actually why I think it's important to cover these
[02:02:45.800 --> 02:02:48.280]   These are not publicity exercises. Yes
[02:02:48.280 --> 02:02:53.320]   That's these are really about remembering the people who made such a difference and really didn't get much credit
[02:02:53.320 --> 02:02:55.800]   So internet hall of fame
[02:02:55.800 --> 02:02:57.560]   Dot org
[02:02:57.560 --> 02:02:59.560]   Congratulations to the 2021
[02:02:59.560 --> 02:03:05.480]   inductees leo leo you should be there we know I did nothing
[02:03:05.480 --> 02:03:08.440]   No nothing
[02:03:08.440 --> 02:03:11.400]   Although this might be in there. This is very
[02:03:11.400 --> 02:03:14.040]   cool
[02:03:14.040 --> 02:03:23.320]   The story of well. I love the title. I blew $720 on 100 notebooks from alley baba and started a paper website business
[02:03:23.320 --> 02:03:27.000]   Uh, the idea is
[02:03:27.000 --> 02:03:29.800]   The author thought wouldn't it be cool?
[02:03:29.800 --> 02:03:34.360]   If I could write a website a blog post medium post
[02:03:34.360 --> 02:03:37.160]   in my moleskine notebook
[02:03:37.160 --> 02:03:43.960]   And then have a face. I've always wondered is no there's no way to say it. I've I've asked the many times
[02:03:44.200 --> 02:03:45.640]   Moskini moles
[02:03:45.640 --> 02:03:50.280]   It's all phony because they're pretending to be you know a classic notebook from france
[02:03:50.280 --> 02:03:55.880]   But they and when you when you go to the website says pronounce it wherever you want. I always say come from Staten island
[02:03:55.880 --> 02:04:02.520]   Exactly. I always pretend it's Italian moleskine because moleskine is disgusting. It sounds kind of like it was something that was
[02:04:02.520 --> 02:04:07.960]   Taken off a dead animal. Yeah. Anyway, so he bought whatever those notebooks
[02:04:07.960 --> 02:04:11.000]   It sounds like a like a moles
[02:04:12.360 --> 02:04:14.360]   skin a moleskin
[02:04:14.360 --> 02:04:19.160]   Moleskine perfect for yeah covering a notebook. Oh
[02:04:19.160 --> 02:04:23.560]   Perhaps except that it's not it's just paper cover
[02:04:23.560 --> 02:04:26.920]   Ben
[02:04:26.920 --> 02:04:33.000]   Ben who is a full stack developer and entrepreneur started an ice cream business and a cookie dough business among others
[02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:36.440]   Uh thought it would be really cool if people could
[02:04:36.440 --> 02:04:39.880]   Write their website in a notebook
[02:04:40.520 --> 02:04:44.760]   And then scan it in when he first did the scans with his phone
[02:04:44.760 --> 02:04:48.440]   The results were so terrible you could show this on the screen john
[02:04:48.440 --> 02:04:53.480]   I mean the years for gobbledygook, but then he had a brilliant idea running through gpt three
[02:04:53.480 --> 02:04:56.680]   everybody's favorite artificial intelligence
[02:04:56.680 --> 02:04:59.560]   and in fact
[02:04:59.560 --> 02:05:01.880]   with a little work
[02:05:01.880 --> 02:05:06.200]   It he was able to get excellent results. So he built a little prototype
[02:05:06.840 --> 02:05:09.800]   Then went online and he bought a bunch of notebooks
[02:05:09.800 --> 02:05:13.480]   From moleskine went online sold
[02:05:13.480 --> 02:05:20.920]   And created paper website dot com and you can now
[02:05:20.920 --> 02:05:24.520]   Go to his website
[02:05:24.520 --> 02:05:30.360]   And sign up the pricing is affordable. He'll send you if you get the ultimate deal for eight dollars a month
[02:05:30.360 --> 02:05:33.720]   He'll send you actually 99 dollars for a year a
[02:05:34.200 --> 02:05:36.920]   notebook that he these are the ones he bought from alli baba
[02:05:36.920 --> 02:05:45.480]   But the idea is you then take a picture of it and it gets uploaded and put on your blog and in fact the entire post
[02:05:45.480 --> 02:05:49.480]   That i'm reading from here was written in a notebook
[02:05:49.480 --> 02:05:52.760]   and uh uploaded
[02:05:52.760 --> 02:05:58.600]   To his blog it's actually a really cute story tiny projects dot dev
[02:05:58.600 --> 02:06:00.760]   and uh
[02:06:00.760 --> 02:06:04.440]   And and it has a very happy ending because it actually worked
[02:06:04.440 --> 02:06:07.320]   He went viral on twitter
[02:06:07.320 --> 02:06:13.080]   And uh, he's now got got on product hunt. He's now making a living. How do you think you'd do with this?
[02:06:13.080 --> 02:06:20.120]   Yeah, I think if you got well, you gotta start stop crying while you're taking your notes. That's my head running
[02:06:20.120 --> 02:06:27.160]   It's it's not obvious. I can't read you must have been doing it in the rain then because it does look like it got damp. That was a spilled
[02:06:29.320 --> 02:06:31.320]   You know what you really need
[02:06:31.320 --> 02:06:35.560]   And I now i'm getting one the elevated craft hybrid cocktail shaker
[02:06:35.560 --> 02:06:40.440]   No more spilling martinis as you take seed. Oh, yeah, I got one
[02:06:40.440 --> 02:06:46.680]   Yeah, it might even come it might even I chose expedited shipping it might even come
[02:06:46.680 --> 02:06:55.080]   For christmas so what cocktail would you make with it for new years? Uh, lisa loves margaritas
[02:06:56.440 --> 02:07:02.360]   But uh, I personally my specialty I usually would would make a gin and tonic or martini
[02:07:02.360 --> 02:07:06.200]   But my specialty is lemon drops and this would be excellent for making lemon drops
[02:07:06.200 --> 02:07:09.960]   170 milliliter lemon drops
[02:07:09.960 --> 02:07:13.000]   What
[02:07:13.000 --> 02:07:15.560]   What would you say is your
[02:07:15.560 --> 02:07:21.640]   Because i'm gonna guess it's gin, but i'm not sure. What is your specialty? Oh, I know what her specialty is. What is it?
[02:07:22.840 --> 02:07:27.720]   Go ahead. Um, well the gin and tonic doesn't count right because that's what i'm saying. That's a two drink cocktail
[02:07:27.720 --> 02:07:33.560]   Um, I would say the green lady is my specialty the green lady green lady. What's that? Yes
[02:07:33.560 --> 02:07:36.600]   It is gin

[02:08:28.440 --> 02:08:30.200]   Why did I think?
[02:08:30.200 --> 02:08:33.080]   I thought we'd had a conversation some years back about uh,
[02:08:33.080 --> 02:08:35.880]   booze that you really I thought it was jins
[02:08:35.880 --> 02:08:38.440]   It was gin
[02:08:38.440 --> 02:08:42.200]   This gin is that drink. I also like I got a little bottle of
[02:08:42.200 --> 02:08:47.160]   I got a bottle of gin recently. I had to throw it out. It was just
[02:08:47.800 --> 02:08:55.080]   Yes, some of the new stuff where they're trying. Oh, they tried too hard. Yeah. What's your favorite, uh, gin? Stacy

[02:09:15.240 --> 02:09:18.280]   That's actually it's too late now unless you want to drink all 25
[02:09:18.280 --> 02:09:23.720]   But uh, oh, that's a great idea the premium gin advent calendar

[02:09:37.480 --> 02:09:41.560]   Yeah, we thought she was talking about absence the green fairy, which is another
[02:09:42.200 --> 02:09:48.440]   Thing entirely. Oh, I've been making a martini that involves absent the grenadine and that is also delightful

[02:11:04.040 --> 02:11:08.440]   The last week tock on on twit is line 141 on twit
[02:11:08.520 --> 02:11:13.800]   I tried to convince lio that bunny the talking dog uses the buttons to talk and he was his usual
[02:11:13.800 --> 02:11:19.160]   cynical growly self now bunny is learning to count line 141
[02:11:19.160 --> 02:11:25.720]   Okay
[02:11:25.720 --> 02:11:33.320]   You know it's not that hard to train a dog to hit a sequence of buttons in order well. No, let's let's just see here. Okay
[02:11:33.320 --> 02:11:38.440]   Okay, how about
[02:11:39.400 --> 02:11:41.400]   Good girl. How about
[02:11:41.400 --> 02:11:46.200]   Yay, buddy knows how to count
[02:11:46.200 --> 02:11:50.440]   Okay, how about
[02:11:50.440 --> 02:11:58.200]   Are you just teasing me now and why why does bunny have blood down her front? I don't know I don't know
[02:11:58.200 --> 02:12:00.200]   Looks like bunny's been eating
[02:12:00.200 --> 02:12:02.200]   Something she shouldn't uh, yeah
[02:12:02.200 --> 02:12:05.720]   I look why is this good?
[02:12:06.680 --> 02:12:08.680]   Why
[02:12:08.680 --> 02:12:14.040]   Why should have seized stacy buddy has one of those things where the dog hits the button
[02:12:14.040 --> 02:12:15.960]   I so I
[02:12:15.960 --> 02:12:18.760]   I know about it because the guy who's working with bunny right now
[02:12:18.760 --> 02:12:23.160]   He was the guy who'd invented something called clever pet which was a connected pet toy that I
[02:12:23.160 --> 02:12:26.040]   Actually had for my dog for a while
[02:12:26.040 --> 02:12:31.400]   And so now he's on this thing and it's just a trip and a half to see where he's gone
[02:12:31.400 --> 02:12:33.400]   I
[02:12:33.400 --> 02:12:39.400]   Soon today ringo by nope
[02:12:39.400 --> 02:12:43.160]   Ringo's family
[02:12:43.160 --> 02:12:52.040]   Drove drove lio drove that crazy. This is like that talking to rilla thing. It's where it's just not I met
[02:12:52.040 --> 02:12:54.120]   That cocoa
[02:12:54.120 --> 02:12:56.120]   Coco does not talk
[02:12:56.120 --> 02:13:00.280]   Coco did coco mavera coco rasan. I will say I I think
[02:13:01.240 --> 02:13:06.280]   Some of the dogs do actually learn the words and associate them with something because oh yeah
[02:13:06.280 --> 02:13:09.080]   You can say walkies and they know you're going for a walk, but
[02:13:09.080 --> 02:13:16.440]   There's the dogs that go and hit the treat button. They're just like treat treat mad treat treat
[02:13:16.440 --> 02:13:25.160]   Like yeah, they get it. All right, and we will wind up our holiday special. This is the last show the year
[02:13:25.160 --> 02:13:27.720]   with this
[02:13:27.720 --> 02:13:29.160]   video
[02:13:29.160 --> 02:13:31.720]   of a tesla being blown up with dynamite
[02:13:31.720 --> 02:13:35.720]   Why why because birk says so
[02:13:35.720 --> 02:13:42.840]   I don't know why I guess she doesn't like her tesla and she's decided she wants to blow it up
[02:13:42.840 --> 02:13:47.800]   But you could do so many
[02:13:47.800 --> 02:13:51.800]   What birk why why why is he blowing up his tesla?
[02:13:51.800 --> 02:13:59.080]   It's going to cost him he has to buy an entirely battery pack to to get to work
[02:13:59.560 --> 02:14:02.680]   Okay, so in order to get to work he'd have to buy new batteries
[02:14:02.680 --> 02:14:07.640]   Which is probably as much as the car cost and new tires so he decided instead
[02:14:07.640 --> 02:14:14.440]   What would what could possibly go wrong if I blow it up with dynamite? Oh wow it went up too
[02:14:14.440 --> 02:14:17.480]   That's a lot of time. Oh
[02:14:17.480 --> 02:14:20.600]   Here it is a slumish
[02:14:20.600 --> 02:14:25.480]   Okay
[02:14:26.520 --> 02:14:29.880]   It's it's I have to say winter in uh, sweet and as brutal
[02:14:29.880 --> 02:14:35.320]   They are so bored so bored they go
[02:14:35.320 --> 02:14:37.800]   Tesla
[02:14:37.800 --> 02:14:40.040]   Exploding
[02:14:40.040 --> 02:14:45.400]   Did you find this birk and you search for exploding teslas? No, no
[02:14:45.400 --> 02:14:51.160]   Oh is in the right to repair. Oh right because he should be able to fix this
[02:14:51.560 --> 02:14:56.600]   But it costs so much money to get tesla to fix it at least he you know he did some nice
[02:14:56.600 --> 02:15:01.480]   Look at this. This is uh, the fuses being lit I guess
[02:15:01.480 --> 02:15:04.520]   It's the debt the debt court
[02:15:04.520 --> 02:15:06.680]   And you see the pressure wave and everything is great
[02:15:06.680 --> 02:15:10.440]   Yeah quite a pressure wave
[02:15:10.440 --> 02:15:12.760]   All right. Well, there's a great way to end the show
[02:15:12.760 --> 02:15:16.280]   That's kind of what the show was like
[02:15:16.280 --> 02:15:19.080]   Exploding tesla
[02:15:19.480 --> 02:15:22.040]   Kept on trying to mow up the rundown
