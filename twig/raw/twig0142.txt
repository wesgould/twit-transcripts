[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:52.160]   Well wants to talk about and that's the truth. Gina Trapani is here from smartawear.org founding editor of Life Hacker dot com.
[00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:57.160]   Hello. Yeah. And you know really we don't want to limit ourselves to anything.
[00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.160]   It's whatever we're in the mood to talk about. Yeah.
[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:05.360]   Chipotle Glee whatever. Also here Mr. Jeff Jarvis.
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.060]   Professor of journalism at the City University of New York. Boggart blog machine.com.
[00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:16.260]   Buzz machine. And it's a big drinking game week folks. You got Glee on. We got Chipotle.
[00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:22.760]   The yos hungry. It's it's getting ready to get drunk. A fun ahead.
[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.960]   Now they're calling you Iron Man. Jeff Iron Man Jarvis. Did you just do something like come back from somewhere?
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:35.360]   Or. The dead. The dead. I don't know why the chat room's calling you Iron Man.
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.260]   I don't know why either. Oh, but you do travel a lot. I do. Yes.
[00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.760]   No, I just got out of a trip to Moscow. I'm actually that's right. But we are going to lose you for a couple of shows.
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.460]   I think. Yes. Yeah. Well, maybe not. I think I can do a soul and Sydney.
[00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.560]   I think I can get up. Oh, yeah. PJ. Soul for sure.
[00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.060]   You'll have unlimited bandwidth in South Korea. Australia.
[00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.860]   I can just hit and miss sometimes. But yeah, you know, we'll be the middle of the night.
[00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.360]   I'm sorry about that. And dedication. Yeah. Also with us.
[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.260]   Mr. Mike Elgin who is on our suggested users list. That's for sure.
[00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.560]   Suggested host list. Elgin.com. Big user of Google plus.
[00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:17.060]   And actually you were a big story this week on Google plus because as you as you said on plus.
[00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.560]   You had been bumped from the suggested users list. I mean, of all people.
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.960]   Yeah. Well, it all turned out to be a big mistake. Oh, back on it.
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:31.760]   So I'm I've been restored to my unfair position on the recommended list.
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.660]   It's awesome to be on there. But yeah, I was off for about three days and Vic.
[00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.760]   Vic Gundotra put you back. But how what did he say?
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.760]   Can't we get Leo on? Well, that's all I give up. I don't care.
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.560]   What he said. He said sounds like a mistake to me.
[00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:52.460]   Right. Let me look into it. He looked into it and he fired 20 people.
[00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:54.560]   And now I'm back. I don't know. I don't know what happened.
[00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.760]   But I'm happy to be back on and what category are you in on the suggested users list.
[00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:07.160]   I'm in tech, which I guess is better than the categories that Gina and Jeff are in.
[00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.360]   And during news, I shouldn't be or Jean. It should be.
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.360]   Oh, they never fixed that. Huh? No.
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.960]   They're still in there. They're still in the opposite categories.
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:20.960]   Tech is OK. I post a lot of stuff that isn't tech though.
[00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:25.360]   So but whatever. I mean, I think a lot of people who are interested in tech,
[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.560]   you know, start circling me and they get enough tech for me.
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.860]   So I no longer see how there it is. I'm going to do you have in circles.
[00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.960]   OK, good. Yes. The numbers there.
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.960]   So this is a protein a million, which is pretty cool.
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:40.760]   It makes sense that Google do this because and Twitter does it.
[00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:45.560]   Facebook even suggests users to you because when you first get to a social network,
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.160]   you know, it's kind of unknown. Well, what, you know, what's going on here?
[00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:51.560]   And if you don't follow people on these networks, you see nothing.
[00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.960]   So they give you categories starting with featured.
[00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:01.360]   Let's see. Ashley Tisdale, Jim Kramer, Kristana Ronaldo.
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.360]   That's I imagine these rotate. I don't know.
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:10.360]   Very kind of very slowly as you know, it's the same group for like three months.
[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.360]   And then they get rid of like 12 people and add 25 or something like that.
[00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:17.360]   Yeah. What it's very controversial on Google
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.960]   Plus though, because a lot of people aren't very good users.
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:23.360]   They're just famous movie stars or something.
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.760]   I mean, some of these people never post anything and they're on the on the list.
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:31.360]   Well, if anybody should be on this list, it would be you because you are.
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.360]   If posting is important, you are very active.
[00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.360]   You use this as your soul one and only. Yeah.
[00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:44.360]   You know, and I also encourage everybody who's who's on that list to sort of spread the love around.
[00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:50.360]   And I try to, you know, great power comes great responsibility.
[00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.360]   Yeah, like Spiderman. Like Spiderman.
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:57.360]   But you know, there's, you know, you need some, I think you need some,
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:00.360]   when people first arrive, you know, from Google's interest,
[00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:05.360]   they don't want people to sign up and then circle nobody and then just sit there with.
[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:07.360]   Oh, here is crickets.
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.360]   And this is a good list. It's eclectic.
[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:17.360]   You know, and what's, what Google does, which I think really gives these people a huge advantage is there's a kind of follow all button.
[00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.360]   Yeah, that's, that's what happens.
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:22.360]   So when you press that follow, you know, you go, oh, yeah, I definitely want to follow.
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:26.360]   So I think probably most new users go click, click, click, click, click, click, right down the list.
[00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:29.360]   Oh, I'm not interested in music. They might skip. I'm not interested in news. They might skip.
[00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.360]   And certainly they get to the bottom of the list and they go to technology.
[00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:35.360]   And that's important that these people be on there.
[00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:38.360]   But Google doesn't say how, I mean, it's, there's a lot of power.
[00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.360]   They say how you get on this list and Vic tell you that.
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:47.360]   No, that is completely, because I used to be on it. I feel like, you know, what did I do?
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:50.360]   Did, you know, which is ridiculous. You're the guy.
[00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:53.360]   You know, I just, I don't want to whine. See, you're on tech.
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:54.360]   All right.
[00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:55.360]   You should be on news.
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:00.360]   You say is even though you have, you know, I now have one, one hundred three million followers,
[00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:06.360]   which is absurd. I'm sure the algorithm does not throw, show all of my stuff to somebody in Thailand.
[00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:09.360]   Right? I don't know.
[00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:16.360]   Does it? There's some flow in there because the comments I get are generally from people who are, you know,
[00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:20.360]   interested in what I'm interested in and not people saying, would you shut up?
[00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.360]   Yeah. That's what I get.
[00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:28.360]   No, I, you know, I think what I noticed, this funny about being on the list is that, you know,
[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:31.360]   I often see that all these people circling me.
[00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:37.360]   It's literally oftentimes thousands per day more and which is crazy.
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:42.360]   And I sort of try to see who they are. And 99% of them are brand new.
[00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:46.360]   So these are, you know, a lot of these people are just coming in, clicking that button.
[00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:49.360]   And now they're circling me and they have never posted anything.
[00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:53.360]   They've hardly served anything. How many of those are spam beasts, though, you think?
[00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:59.360]   It's, well, I mean, it's significantly less than one percent, but that's a lot of people.
[00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:05.360]   And now that Google is sort of automating the, like suppressing the spam thing, which I'm not sure is a great idea
[00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:12.360]   in the long run, they used to just let the spam comments exist in the comments and then it was up to the user to go in
[00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:17.360]   and delete them. Now they sort of, if anybody flags them, they go into this invisible area where you can go
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:20.360]   and delete them, but nobody goes in there now because they're out of sight out of mind.
[00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:27.360]   So, no, they're still there. I still see them. But, you know, somebody has to flag them.
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:30.360]   If nobody flags them, they're actually much sick there. That's why.
[00:08:30.360 --> 00:08:39.360]   Yeah. I mean, you know, it's funny. I think in terms of users, Jeff and I are very, very different in terms of the types of things we post.
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:45.360]   Jeff posts all this, you know, intellectual stuff. You pretty much have to anger.
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:49.360]   Well, no, but you have to be pretty well educated and pretty good with English.
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:57.360]   I post a lot of stuff that's just visual or, you know, just very, very simple and it plays really well in countries
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:04.360]   where people aren't speaking English very well. I get on the what's hot list a lot for that very reason, I think.
[00:09:04.360 --> 00:09:12.360]   If you post a, you know, you post a lot of stuff about, you know, obviously journalism and privacy and all those kinds of things,
[00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:17.360]   which if you are barely speaking English and you live in Madagascar or something like that,
[00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:23.360]   you're not going to relate to it as much as, you know, something that's almost purely visual or something that's just not looking at this amazing yacht.
[00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:29.360]   Yeah. Exactly. I don't post those, but I should post more animated gifts. I think that would get me on the suggested user list.
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:37.360]   It might. Yeah. Now, I know I'm not because I only have 294,000 followers, which is up like 10,000 from six months ago or something.
[00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:45.360]   And so I think the reason that's important, we talk about this is, and I'm sure it was important to you, Mike, is a million followers.
[00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:53.360]   That's something, even if, you know, some of them are spam, that's a lot of people. And I think that means anybody who joins Google Plus is very likely to follow you.
[00:09:53.360 --> 00:10:04.360]   Yeah. It's, it's, it really, it's really funny. Sometimes I post things and I get, it's hard to believe with so many followers, but sometimes I post things and I get three comments.
[00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:13.360]   Right. And you do something, I saw somebody analyze what you do, which is, I think really interesting. You always have, and I started doing this too, because I think this is really cool.
[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:22.360]   You have, you bold the first line. It's a headline, basically. Yes. And then you do, you a lot of paragraphing, which makes it easy to understand what you're talking about and a lot of links.
[00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:33.360]   Is that true? And then you always have an image. That's true. And, and if you, if you used to be with the old design, if you shared somebody else's post or just paste in a link and let it automatically put the little picture on it.
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:44.360]   Then you get this unappealing thing that doesn't get a lot of engagement. I found that if you just post an original post and then put just a regular old fashioned link in there, put your own picture in there, you get a lot more engagement.
[00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:52.360]   It feels like, I don't know, I really don't know what it is. Now, if you post, if you reshare a photo, the photo is full size.
[00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:54.360]   I love this. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:55.360]   Yeah.
[00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:55.360]   Yeah.
[00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:57.360]   Full size photos and videos are really nice.
[00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:59.360]   All right. Let's get to the redesign. I'm done bitching.
[00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:04.360]   Congratulations on getting back onto the suggested users list, Mike. I'm proud of you.
[00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:05.360]   I'll start bitching now.
[00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:09.360]   Well, yeah, that's a good point. Let's talk about that.
[00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:10.360]   That's a bitching.
[00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:17.360]   You know what? You know what? I don't want to be that guy who hates anything new. And I think I actually, I'm pretty proud of myself.
[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:24.360]   I think for an old fart, I tend to like new stuff more. In fact, I'm kind of a fan of the new.
[00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:32.360]   But so I'm not going to say anything. I'm going to let you guys convince me why the Google Plus redesign is so cool. Gina Trapani.
[00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:39.360]   You know, it's much better. There are a lot of things I really like about it. First, I really like the way that you can customize it.
[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:47.360]   I like that you can drag items in the left sidebar and hide them. If you don't like them, for example, I don't play games on Google Plus.
[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:52.360]   So I just drag that down into the the more link, which makes it go away, which is really nice.
[00:11:52.360 --> 00:11:53.360]   Yeah, that is nice.
[00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:59.360]   I like the activity drawer, what they're calling the activity drawer on each post, which is on the bottom right.
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:07.360]   It's a little arrow that will expand, you know, activity information on the post, you know, who liked it and who shared it, that kind of thing.
[00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:10.360]   And it'll replace the comments with that.
[00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:13.360]   Where's that? Show me that again.
[00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:15.360]   On a post.
[00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:19.360]   Oh, see, I guess there's, yeah, I've seen that. I don't see it right now.
[00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:21.360]   On the right here, right?
[00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:24.360]   Yeah, go to that. I've got a.
[00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:28.360]   Oh, there it is. Here we go. Here we go. Here we go. This shows the activity.
[00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:35.360]   Yeah, calling that the activity drawer. So it kind of flips down and shows you who liked it. You can replace comments, which is a nice UI to me.
[00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:42.360]   I really like white space in general. So I like the way that you don't mind this column here.
[00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:48.360]   That does look a little weird to me. It was interesting. I didn't, I hadn't seen that because my browser wasn't full screen.
[00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:50.360]   So that is a little strange.
[00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:57.360]   It really, it seems that Google wants you to take your browser, and this is an 11 inch screen and squeeze. Oh, wait a minute.
[00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:04.360]   I'm sorry. I say, it seems as if Google wants you to squeeze your browser. Wait a minute. It's, you see what I'm saying?
[00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:07.360]   Yeah. This is stupid. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
[00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:10.360]   I'm sorry. Tell me more about why this is great, Gina.
[00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:18.360]   And I also like the way each one of the posts is kind of contained inside of a particular, you know, a box where, hey, I'm saying something.
[00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:28.360]   And I just, I just like, I like the layout. I like how the emphasis is on the stream. I really like the profile. If you click on your profile, this is very actually the new thing in the profile is very Facebooky.
[00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:32.360]   You can add a banner image across the top. So put it on that profile.
[00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:41.360]   You can place those photos, like, like, mouse over your photos at the top there. If you choose change photos, you can choose just a banner photo across the top.
[00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:45.360]   Why do I have that, Leo? If you're to me.
[00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:54.360]   You're a really big profile picture, too. Okay. So wait a minute. Now I'll stop. Go away. Okay. Go to Jeff Jarvis.
[00:13:54.360 --> 00:14:04.360]   I mean, look at that huge gorgeous picture of you, Leo. I had to change it because it was so ugly that I realized I was going to be like, so now you have a, oh, this is neat. That's really neat.
[00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:09.360]   I mean, in general, just the big pictures, the big videos, it makes it just a much more compelling media.
[00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:15.360]   It's a little bit like, gosh, what does that look like? It seems familiar. I've seen that before somewhere. It's so ridiculous.
[00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:21.360]   I hate to think about where I've seen where they have that big thing going.
[00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:27.360]   That's the most pathetic part is that it looks exactly like some other servers we're trying to remember right now.
[00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:34.360]   Yeah. Facebook. That's it. Facebook. Now, by the way, this is even more interesting now.
[00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:41.360]   Apparently these things, this item slides under that until it gets to, right? Oh, then it disappears.
[00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:45.360]   So that's slightly responsive.
[00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:52.360]   Yeah, I guess. Okay. One of the things that... What else do we love about this?
[00:14:52.360 --> 00:15:06.360]   Tell me, I do like the fact that I could change these buttons up here. Christmas even did a fun post. If you go to your circles, you can, by dragging, it's the first three circles in your circles are the buttons up here.
[00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:13.360]   So I decided, or the first two, so I decided I needed to it in friends more than I needed acquaintances, whatever those were.
[00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:20.360]   So you just move these around. What are these first two circles you're going to have in the home page there? That's nice. What else?
[00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:27.360]   They're emphasizing hangouts a lot by putting that constant hangout on the right and the chatting with. They're trying to increase...
[00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:30.360]   They keep trying to push hangout. Hangout obviously matters a lot to them.
[00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:38.360]   Hangouts has its own page now. If you look in the thing called the... What are they calling it? They're calling it the...
[00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:41.360]   They want you to video chat with the whole family.
[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:46.360]   Calling it the ribbon on the left. And so now it's a whole Hangouts page.
[00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:52.360]   It's got its button. Here's the Hangouts page. And they're Hangouts to watch, Hangouts to join.
[00:15:52.360 --> 00:16:02.360]   And all those ones that are available to join are ones that you've been invited to. So they're either public or you've been specifically invited.
[00:16:02.360 --> 00:16:11.360]   And they even have a very large banner, which I hope someday I'll be able to close advertising all the wonderful features.
[00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:18.360]   On an 11 inch screen, that's a third of the screen, this banner, this ad. Is that going to go away?
[00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:21.360]   Yeah, I'm surprised that there is a don't show me this anymore button there.
[00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:27.360]   Usually a Facebook usually. Hey Google, you should go look at Facebook. They usually have a close this button there.
[00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:29.360]   I like how they do that.
[00:16:29.360 --> 00:16:31.360]   Leo Salty today.
[00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:38.360]   This is horrible. I am not kidding. This is so retro. These boxes around everything. You think that's good?
[00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:41.360]   Look at all the boxiness. They call it a card.
[00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:47.360]   And the idea is that there's so much stuff associated with the post. You've got the likes, you've got the buttons for controls.
[00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:54.360]   There are third party browser plugins and you can have a dozen of these things that translate the language, do all these things.
[00:16:54.360 --> 00:17:01.360]   And those are all contained with the comments in a single container. I like the idea that they're corralled together.
[00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:13.360]   So it's a single unit that can be passed around and so on. The other thing that's there's a lot of for a service that specializes in something called circles.
[00:17:13.360 --> 00:17:18.360]   There are a lot of edges. There are a lot of right angles, which is a little bit visually annoying.
[00:17:18.360 --> 00:17:22.360]   But they've really improved the appearance of photographs.
[00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:30.360]   I do like that. They clearly know that photographers love Google+ and they want to encourage that.
[00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:35.360]   So now we've got trending topics always visible a lot Twitter.
[00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:40.360]   By the way, one of them, of course, as usual, Nicki Minaj, your Britney Spears are included in the list.
[00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:55.360]   They always will be. You just might as well just leave that there. One of them is #whitespace, which shows you that it's kind of something people aren't crazy about.
[00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:57.360]   I'm not alone, I guess, in my...
[00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:03.360]   I see the whitespace is future proofing. This is a very future-proof design.
[00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:06.360]   Apparently, Vic Condouter says, "We're going to use this."
[00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:14.360]   Yeah. And the stuff in the ribbon on the left, you can add an infinite number of stuff to that.
[00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:18.360]   There's a lot of places to add more stuff, and you can make sure they will.
[00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:23.360]   So I might be able to drag a piece of something there that I use a lot or could be.
[00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:27.360]   But they seem to have given themselves a lot more flexibility. But it has to be said.
[00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:35.360]   I think one of the... The one in totally non-controversial change, the performance is way better.
[00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:36.360]   Is it?
[00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:42.360]   When you used to click to do a new comment, you'd click the mouse pointer in where you're going to add a post,
[00:18:42.360 --> 00:18:48.360]   and you used to have to wait two or three seconds before it responded and let you start typing.
[00:18:48.360 --> 00:18:51.360]   Now, it's pretty instantaneous to start a new post.
[00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:56.360]   Is it, Mike, I find that when I try to add people they're recommending to me, that's taking forever in that box.
[00:18:56.360 --> 00:19:02.360]   So if you go to where is it suggest people to me?
[00:19:02.360 --> 00:19:06.360]   You may know, and you click on that thing.
[00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:14.360]   This must be in this white space. I don't have it either. I used to occasionally get stuff like that there.
[00:19:14.360 --> 00:19:16.360]   I don't know what's going on.
[00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:19.360]   You think you may know it's actually really good. It makes good recommendations.
[00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:24.360]   Yeah. No, it's the best one out there. I don't see it either.
[00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:28.360]   So top three hated things about it, Leo.
[00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:34.360]   I just, well, I mean, you know, I've...
[00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:37.360]   Go ahead.
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:46.360]   I don't know. I mean, it's just, it's an overall feeling. I feel like these boxes just feel very constipated to me,
[00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:52.360]   especially given the waste of my screen real estate that they've imposed on me here.
[00:19:52.360 --> 00:20:01.360]   It's, you know what? It's, it's, it's my opinion, I guess, in general, that Google is very clearly going to start using my screen real estate to promote Google.
[00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:06.360]   You know, this is why everybody liked Google.com.
[00:20:06.360 --> 00:20:10.360]   Now, all of a sudden, it's full of crap.
[00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:19.360]   It's, and it's just the beginning. And I think this is the new Google saying, whatever we're on your screen, we're going to be in your face with all of our stuff.
[00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:23.360]   It was the old design good? It was simple.
[00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:24.360]   Oh, okay.
[00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:30.360]   Look, now it's trying to get me to talk Chrome. It's trying to visit the Google art project. It's got this bar up here.
[00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:31.360]   That's just Google.com.
[00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:33.360]   It's Google plus. We the old Google plus design.
[00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:39.360]   Well, I don't, you're right. I don't, I mean, I suppose this is more functional, I guess. I don't know. I just, and, you know, maybe it's a response.
[00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:45.360]   Maybe it's designed for Chromebooks. Oh, look, I didn't know that, but apparently I changed my profile.
[00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:48.360]   Oh, when, yeah, when we were looking at the banner, you had chosen the...
[00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:49.360]   I chose it.
[00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:52.360]   Yeah, so yeah, click on that and you can go back to your photos.
[00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:54.360]   Oh, I see you're right. I clicked there.
[00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:55.360]   Yeah.
[00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:56.360]   I'm going to leave that.
[00:20:56.360 --> 00:21:01.360]   My only thing, right, which is, is that the comment text isn't, doesn't have enough contrast. It's hard to read the comment text.
[00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:04.360]   Yeah, it's now great. I don't understand that either. It's...
[00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:05.360]   Yeah, that was a weird choice.
[00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:15.360]   And bold doesn't really show up very well in the grade comments. So I used to use bolding as, as Mike does. It looks great in the initial posts.
[00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:19.360]   Let me find... And the person's name is black, but what they say is gray. Yeah.
[00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:21.360]   And that's seen the little strange.
[00:21:21.360 --> 00:21:24.360]   Well, those things they can fix, right? Yes.
[00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:27.360]   Yeah, you see here it's gray. They tend to.
[00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:34.360]   But I think that's... I don't think they will fix it because I think they're trying to create a hierarchy.
[00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:40.360]   So the more readable, it's the same... the type is the same size in the post and the comments.
[00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:46.360]   But by giving the post a white background, it de-emphasizes what's in the gray background.
[00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:48.360]   Right. Yeah, I think that's...
[00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:54.360]   I'm guessing. That makes sense, right? So making the comment kind of an addendum to the posts.
[00:21:54.360 --> 00:21:59.360]   But I think you can do that without making the comment text difficult to read.
[00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:03.360]   Leo, can I have a prepared statement essentially about...
[00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:05.360]   Yes, let's hear your prepared statement.
[00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:10.360]   Because they've been a lot of discussions about this concept of...
[00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:13.360]   By the way, this is a stream while you talk. I'm just going to show the stream.
[00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:21.360]   This is the #usesforwhitespace. What you could do with that white space that you've got hanging around.
[00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:22.360]   You're kidding there.
[00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:26.360]   But a lot of people put Facebook there. Oh, clippy. There you go.
[00:22:26.360 --> 00:22:29.360]   Some bacon would be nice. I wouldn't mind that.
[00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:36.360]   I think people should harass apple.com to fill up all that white space because it's so horrible. All that wasted space.
[00:22:36.360 --> 00:22:40.360]   Yeah, but that's... You know what? There's a difference, isn't there? Between this and apple.com.
[00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:43.360]   Well, it's not worth it.
[00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:49.360]   Apple.com... They want me to use this. Apple.com is an ad for Apple. Google wants me to use this, right?
[00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:55.360]   Right. I mean, I'm a big fan of white space. And one of the things I hate about Facebook is there isn't any.
[00:22:55.360 --> 00:23:02.360]   And so you're just hammered by this cacophony of visual noise. And I can't stand to look at it. It's like...
[00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:04.360]   It's just way too much. That's a good point.
[00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:12.360]   There's stuff like... Remember the controversy of the hidden messages where, you know, if Facebook decided it might be spam,
[00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:18.360]   it put it in this folder. It was right there in the left nav bar. Just click it and you would see the stuff.
[00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:23.360]   But nobody ever did. Nobody ever paid attention because there's so much stuff in the left.
[00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:29.360]   There is a lot going on in there. Yeah. And it's just too much. And I kind of like the white space.
[00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:37.360]   But back to the idea of all these different features being foisted upon the user. It seems clear to me,
[00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:46.360]   and in fact, Google has actually announced this explicitly, that what they're doing right now is they are reversing course
[00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:51.360]   in terms of being a company that has... Here's a product, there's a product, there's a product, there's a product,
[00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:57.360]   they have nothing to eat each other. First, they long ago, they unified the passwords.
[00:23:57.360 --> 00:24:02.360]   And then eventually, you unified the privacy policies. And now everything is showing up everywhere.
[00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:09.360]   What they're doing is they're taking different products and they're turning them into features of a single product.
[00:24:09.360 --> 00:24:18.360]   They want you to be a Google user. And if you think about it, if you look at Facebook, nobody complains that messages
[00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:24.360]   is being forced on you if you're a user of Facebook. You think, well, that's just a feature of Facebook.
[00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:34.360]   So Google's doing something unusual in that they're starting with a bunch of products and they're moving to a unified product.
[00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:40.360]   But I mean, look at Apple. Everybody loves Apple because it's all just... If you use iPhone, you're also using iTunes,
[00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:44.360]   all these other things, nobody complains about it because it was like that from the beginning.
[00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:56.360]   So I really think that people should take what Google said more seriously in terms of genuinely unifying disparate products into a single product.
[00:24:56.360 --> 00:25:04.360]   And I think they're doing it for survival because they've found that there's so much stuff going on out there for Google to just have all these disconnected things.
[00:25:04.360 --> 00:25:08.360]   Isn't really serving their mission.
[00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:20.360]   But I'll agree with Leo here that I don't disagree with unification. I do think that if they did it with better designers and a better aesthetic sense and a better sense of use, that would be a good thing.
[00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:26.360]   And they're up against tough competition. They're not saying Facebook is gorgeous or Twitter is gorgeous, but Apple is.
[00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:31.360]   And I think that Google could be a lot prettier than it is.
[00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:36.360]   And the white space, I like white space, but white space because we didn't know what to put in it is not white space.
[00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:40.360]   It's a mistake.
[00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:49.360]   You know, I think it's probably fixable. I mean, you're right. I think that what do they call it? The bar, the toolbar on the left ribbon ribbon.
[00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:51.360]   That's a Microsoft word.
[00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:52.360]   Yeah.
[00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:58.360]   The ribbon makes a lot of sense. The fact that it's customizable is fantastic. That's exactly what you want.
[00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:09.360]   I think there's potential here. It just it feels simultaneously cluttered and a wasted space. It's a bizarre.
[00:26:09.360 --> 00:26:17.360]   I think it's got some elegant things about it like the ribbon, but I think that it's not art.
[00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:22.360]   And Jason Calic has just put a Twitter in the white space. I think that's what I'll do.
[00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:30.360]   Yeah. But I do think that it's an interesting change for Google because recently they've been a design driven company.
[00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:33.360]   Whether you like this design or not, it's a design. It is a design.
[00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:37.360]   Their websites used to basically be design free. Yeah.
[00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:48.360]   And now they're actually designing things and using design as a strategic advantage or they're attempting it.
[00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:54.360]   And that's a very big change. And that's another way they're unifying their products is through design.
[00:26:54.360 --> 00:26:59.360]   Let me show you one other thing that I think is probably an unintended consequence.
[00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:06.360]   I often use increase the font sizes on my pages because I'm an old man and this is a fairly fine font.
[00:27:06.360 --> 00:27:12.360]   I'm going to just do it, notch it up one. And that's the result.
[00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:22.360]   Notch it up to. I mean, now it's certainly legible. But boy, it's not what I would call responding probably in an intelligent way.
[00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:28.360]   That if you really like this chat bar, they disappear at the drop of a hat.
[00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:31.360]   Oh, you know, the truth is I don't like the chat bar. It's what I'd get rid of the chat bar.
[00:27:31.360 --> 00:27:35.360]   Give me a chat with anybody. Yeah, maybe. Yeah, I don't want that there.
[00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:38.360]   I want the option to get rid of that. And I don't.
[00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:44.360]   The truth is I don't use Hangouts and so much space is dedicated to getting me to use a Hangout.
[00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:48.360]   I feel a little put upon. But here it is that you might like things.
[00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:51.360]   So this is the these are the things you might want to add.
[00:27:51.360 --> 00:27:54.360]   If you if you if you mouse over, you might like, you will see on the right.
[00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:58.360]   No mouse over the top line. Yeah, you'll see it go to a full page of them.
[00:27:58.360 --> 00:28:02.360]   Oh, no, maybe that's different from people you should follow.
[00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:04.360]   You may know. You may know.
[00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:06.360]   Yeah, it's another one.
[00:28:06.360 --> 00:28:10.360]   I think that it's not it's not the end of the world, obviously.
[00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:14.360]   Well, you were just dishening Google plus last week anyway. So yeah, I mean,
[00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:20.360]   I think they're trying to try to keep this fresh and interesting and useful.
[00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:28.360]   I think they've deprecated the content and they've up ticked their promotion.
[00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:34.360]   And I think that that is not the direction I would want to go more than it was already on Google plus.
[00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:38.360]   I mean, they already had Hangouts there and trying to get you going and all that stuff.
[00:28:38.360 --> 00:28:42.360]   Is this is it my imagination or is the content.
[00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:46.360]   The post art is a smaller portion of the page. It feels like.
[00:28:46.360 --> 00:28:50.360]   But they're representing media in ways that they weren't before. Right.
[00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:54.360]   I mean, the images are much I do like that. Yeah, that's a good choice.
[00:28:54.360 --> 00:28:58.360]   And video to and video to. And this is how a Hangout is now displayed,
[00:28:58.360 --> 00:29:03.360]   which I think is nicely done. And, you know, I feel a little put upon by Hangouts as well,
[00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:08.360]   because I don't use it as much as I thought that I would. But Hangouts is the one big
[00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:12.360]   differentiating feature for Google plus. And it's a really cool feature.
[00:29:12.360 --> 00:29:16.360]   I think that a lot of people really like it. So I make sense that they would say,
[00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:20.360]   you know, that they would promote. Right. Right.
[00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:27.360]   I think the Internet, the all of the tech giants have discovered that the key to mega success
[00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:31.360]   is the ability to change user behavior at scale.
[00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:37.360]   And this whole design and even the previous design is designed to get you to change your behavior.
[00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:42.360]   They're trying to move the world from a non hangout using world to a hangout using world.
[00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:46.360]   Kind of for that instead. Yeah. Well, it's and it's different for Google.
[00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:50.360]   Go used to be like, you know, here's our stuff. Do whatever you want.
[00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:53.360]   And now they're kind of like, here's what you should be doing. Right.
[00:29:53.360 --> 00:29:56.360]   So, you know, but it works for Apple. That's for sure.
[00:29:56.360 --> 00:30:00.360]   Apple's really masterful at changing user behavior.
[00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:03.360]   And that's the key to their success.
[00:30:03.360 --> 00:30:07.360]   That's maybe a little disappointing for me because I always thought of Google as the anti-Apple.
[00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:11.360]   Right. The alternative maybe in some ways. And if they're just going to be just like Apple,
[00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:14.360]   well, what have we gained?
[00:30:14.360 --> 00:30:18.360]   Where, you know, they're the alternative to Facebook too for many of us.
[00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:22.360]   Yes. It is interesting to see these companies kind of move toward one another. Right.
[00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:25.360]   I mean, one of our big gripes with Facebook is that it's this closed unified space
[00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:27.360]   that you have to sign in to get content. Right.
[00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:30.360]   And Google was the opposite of that. It was open. It was public.
[00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:32.360]   You don't have to be signed in. Everything. You know, it wasn't.
[00:30:32.360 --> 00:30:35.360]   And now Google's moving toward being more unified.
[00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:38.360]   And I think probably Facebook would benefit from being a little more open.
[00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:41.360]   And we're seeing a similar kind of thing with Apple and Google. Right.
[00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:44.360]   I mean, Larry Page talks about his discussions with Steve Jobs.
[00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:52.360]   And I know those are driving his unification and this emphasis on a clean, simple, beautiful interface,
[00:30:52.360 --> 00:30:57.360]   which he talked about in his year and memo, which I think came out after our episode last week.
[00:30:57.360 --> 00:31:00.360]   Yes. We should talk about that. I did. Yeah.
[00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:03.360]   Yeah. So it's just interesting to see these companies recognize, you know,
[00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:08.360]   in the face of their own strengths, recognize their weaknesses and try to kind of move toward, you know,
[00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:14.360]   the others strategy. But when you do things kind of half-assed, sometimes you get products that are, you know,
[00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:15.360]   don't, don't quite make it.
[00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:18.360]   What's the most beautiful Google product?
[00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:22.360]   Well, it's the circles editor in Google Plus.
[00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:24.360]   That's pretty cool. That's the Andy Hertzfeld thing.
[00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:26.360]   I'd love to hear from some designers.
[00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:29.360]   And maybe there's some designers in the chat room or somewhere who could talk to us.
[00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:33.360]   But I'd love to hear from some designers about what they think about this.
[00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:41.360]   It doesn't, there's, I can't articulate it, but it feels to me a little framed and claustrophobic and like,
[00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:44.360]   escape-proof.
[00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:48.360]   But when you compare it to Facebook, like Leo, when you were switching, we've seen those details.
[00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:49.360]   Facebook's a horrible design.
[00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:54.360]   Yeah. I think Paul Ford said it's like a police van crashing into an Ikea continuously.
[00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:58.360]   Yeah. And everybody agrees on that. It's, you know, we all know that it's a horrible design.
[00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:01.360]   Right. I mean, I know you don't agree with me, Leo, but I would say right now,
[00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:03.360]   Google Plus is the most beautiful product that Google has.
[00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:04.360]   Really?
[00:32:04.360 --> 00:32:06.360]   Well, you have better taste than I do.
[00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:07.360]   That's the most...
[00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:13.360]   No, I don't. I'm not a designer. And you should, but you should get a real designer on to discuss these things.
[00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:14.360]   Yeah.
[00:32:14.360 --> 00:32:15.360]   The pro is a pro.
[00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:18.360]   The pro says, and this is true. He says, it's left justified. That's one of the reasons you don't like it.
[00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:20.360]   It is left justified.
[00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:21.360]   It is left justified.
[00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:25.360]   Which is kind of nowadays, I don't think necessary, but, uh, okay.
[00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:27.360]   Well, I just want to ask you about the question.
[00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:29.360]   What's the most? Go ahead.
[00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:34.360]   I was going to say, I've been using a new to-do list called Apago to-do,
[00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:41.360]   and it's a really interesting design thing that they did, and I would love for Google to sort of copy this approach.
[00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:47.360]   It's a to-do list that has separate apps for the desktop, for the iPad, and for the iPhone.
[00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:51.360]   And each of those apps is completely different from each other.
[00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:54.360]   They look like they were designed by entirely different companies.
[00:32:54.360 --> 00:33:02.360]   The desktop app looks like a desktop app. It kind of looks like a Windows app rather than a Mac application.
[00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:10.360]   The phone app looks very like iPhone-y, and the iPad app is just an entirely purely iPad creature.
[00:33:10.360 --> 00:33:14.360]   Now, they make you pay for each one of these individually, and it's not that cheap.
[00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:19.360]   You know, the lot costs you like $35 or something like that for a to-do app that's a little bit of money.
[00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:27.360]   But I would love to see- I would love this new design, which I do love anyway, but I would love it even more.
[00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:33.360]   If they came out with an iPad app for Google+, which now doesn't exist right now, you have to use the iPhone version,
[00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:41.360]   that is a really tablity version that's completely different from this, no corrals, free-flowing.
[00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:46.360]   I would love to see them do that, because I think this makes a certain amount of sense for, you know,
[00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:50.360]   they're shooting for hundreds of millions of desktops.
[00:33:50.360 --> 00:33:56.360]   But this, but a tablet version, if it was completely different from this, would be fantastic.
[00:33:56.360 --> 00:34:04.360]   Here was one of the complaints from a Thailand Google+ user.
[00:34:04.360 --> 00:34:05.360]   Great example, though.
[00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:07.360]   Yes, I like the choice.
[00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:10.360]   And he comes, obviously, to look at your stuff.
[00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:12.360]   Is Ria Pari Parit.
[00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:24.360]   He says, "The problem is here on my 1280x800 screen, content consumes 26.9%, and the rest is essentially wasted."
[00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:26.360]   That's a good point. That's well said.
[00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:34.360]   If your browser is open up that far, personally, and this is, you know, I'm not an average user in this case,
[00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:36.360]   I think a lot of people go full-screen on this stuff.
[00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:42.360]   I have two Google+ windows open at all times, and then I have another third window, for the most part.
[00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:48.360]   And it actually works better for that, because if you crunch down the browser's window size,
[00:34:48.360 --> 00:34:54.360]   it actually crunches down into a smaller thing where the content takes up 90%.
[00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:56.360]   Yeah, but you are a usual in that way.
[00:34:56.360 --> 00:34:59.360]   Yeah, exactly. But hey, I love it.
[00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:05.360]   So the point is that it's designed to be right-sized.
[00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:10.360]   So if you go all the way out, they keep adding more junk to it with the, you know, I shouldn't call it junk,
[00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:12.360]   but like the chat list and all that stuff.
[00:35:12.360 --> 00:35:14.360]   And if you shrink a debt back down...
[00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:18.360]   But they should optimize for the user for full-size.
[00:35:18.360 --> 00:35:21.360]   And what they did was they optimized for Google for full-size.
[00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:25.360]   Well, what they should do is they should be responsive design and use it.
[00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:27.360]   We know how to do this, folks.
[00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:28.360]   Yeah.
[00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:33.360]   They should use the screen. However big or small I want to make it, they should use it appropriately.
[00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:37.360]   No doubt they have the numbers on, you know, what the average screen size of most users is.
[00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:40.360]   Well, I'm glad I'm not, I guess I'm not average, right?
[00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:44.360]   You do have a lot of white space, white space there though.
[00:35:44.360 --> 00:35:46.360]   This is an 11 inch screen.
[00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:48.360]   This is a tiny screen.
[00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:50.360]   All right, we're going to take a break.
[00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:52.360]   Come back with more. I'm done bitching.
[00:35:52.360 --> 00:35:57.360]   I apologize. I don't, I really hate it when people, when something changes inevitably, everybody says,
[00:35:57.360 --> 00:35:59.360]   horrible, horrible. I've gone through that.
[00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:02.360]   Every time we change something onto it, we get that.
[00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:07.360]   And so I understand, but there's something wrong with it that bugs me.
[00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:13.360]   And I can't quite place it. And I'm not alone, but maybe I'm just joining the chorus of people who say,
[00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:15.360]   "It changed it."
[00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:20.360]   So, and it's true that Facebook is hideous. I mean, there's no question about it.
[00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:23.360]   And others do it worse.
[00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:27.360]   I just, I maybe I thought I was hoping Google would do it better.
[00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:30.360]   We're going to take a break. Come back with more.
[00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:35.360]   Gene Trappani, Mike Elgin, Jeff Jarvis brought to you today by Stamps.com.
[00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:38.360]   I'll tell you what I'll say. Wait in line at the post office.
[00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:43.360]   But who likes that? Who likes that? Oh, maybe you like to socialize there, right?
[00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:45.360]   Now that they've got, well, they got a new stamp coming out, right?
[00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:50.360]   They're closing post offices. I could tell you those lines are going to get longer and longer.
[00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:52.360]   Parking is tougher and tougher.
[00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:54.360]   Wouldn't you like to bring the post office to your desk?
[00:36:54.360 --> 00:37:00.360]   You can do everything you do at the post office right now, right here, with your own computer and your own printer,
[00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:02.360]   with Stamps.com.
[00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:07.360]   Mac or PC, you print the postage you need, always exactly the right postage.
[00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:14.360]   In fact, they've got and they offer for free a USB scale that will exactly weigh your packages or your letters
[00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:17.360]   and give you always the right postage.
[00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:24.360]   They have discounts. The post office does not offer up to 21% on express mail, up to 15% on priority mail.
[00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:30.360]   Because it's a computer, it's smart. It does things like, you know, it can use your address book from QuickBooks
[00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:35.360]   for filling out invoices. If you're doing international mail orders, it does international.
[00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:37.360]   It will fill out the forms and everything.
[00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:40.360]   And the best part is you never have to take that now to the post office.
[00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:45.360]   Your mail carrier, who comes every day, will pick it up or you can even call and schedule a free pickup.
[00:37:45.360 --> 00:37:49.360]   The post office loves Stamps.com because it's offloading them.
[00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:52.360]   And that's why you should try it. I want you to go to Stamps.com.
[00:37:52.360 --> 00:37:57.360]   When you do go to Stamps.com, you're going to see initially an $80 special offer done.
[00:37:57.360 --> 00:38:01.360]   Don't go for that. Click that microphone in the upper right hand corner.
[00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:06.360]   I consider that my microphone. And you'll get my offer, which is a $110 bonus offer.
[00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:12.360]   It includes $55 of free postage. We'll give you more free postage when you do it this way.
[00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:17.360]   $55 free postage and the scale and supplies.
[00:38:17.360 --> 00:38:20.360]   Kit and a 4-week trial. All you have to do is pay shipping and handling on the scale.
[00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:23.360]   It's really great. You're going to love this.
[00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:31.360]   Stamps.com, click the microphone and then enter the offer code Twig.
[00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:37.360]   And you will get this $110 bonus value. Stamps.com, the offer code is Twig.
[00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:41.360]   I've been using them since the turn of the century.
[00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:46.360]   It's around 2000. I want to say 2003, 2004. And it's just great.
[00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:50.360]   All right. We're going to move along. There are many other things we could talk about.
[00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:54.360]   The Google+ one, you know why it hit me hard is because it's my homepage.
[00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:58.360]   That's how much I love Google+ even though they don't like me. I like them.
[00:38:58.360 --> 00:39:03.360]   And it's my homepage. And so it's funny when your homepage is so dramatically changed.
[00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:08.360]   I opened it while we were doing security now. And I literally, it's on tape. I gasped.
[00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:16.360]   I went, what happened? What? So maybe I'm just have to get used to it. That's all.
[00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:22.360]   Instagram, we haven't talked about that since we convened last week.
[00:39:22.360 --> 00:39:31.360]   Are we in a bubble? $1 billion. Jeff Jarvis. Why would Facebook pay $1 billion for an iPhone app?
[00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:39.360]   They've got it. The arguments are many. The arguments are many that they needed mobile.
[00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:44.360]   They needed better photo that they needed the audience that they were scared of it because they see themselves.
[00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:51.360]   Facebook sees itself. I think perhaps too much is a photo service, but so much of their usage is photo and Instagram was better.
[00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:56.360]   As someone said in one of the clips of the thing today, $1 billion for crappy filters.
[00:39:56.360 --> 00:40:05.360]   Yeah. I'm not an Instagram fanatic at all. I hardly use it ever.
[00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:13.360]   See, I love Instagram. I mean, I used it a lot. When it first came out, I was a big early supporter of Instagram.
[00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:16.360]   And that's what they purchased for $1 billion. They purchased you.
[00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:23.360]   30 million me's. Yes, exactly. And I just wrote a column about this, which is going to go live any second now.
[00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:28.360]   There are basically three things that Facebook got out of this that they didn't already have.
[00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:37.360]   I mean, don't tell me about users because most Instagram users also use Facebook and it's only 30-35 million people versus 800-900 million.
[00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:40.360]   So they didn't buy users. They didn't really buy technology.
[00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:44.360]   There's no technology in Instagram that's worth the damn.
[00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:52.360]   Can you steal it all? It's a pretty good design, but it's a free app with cheesy filters that's really easy to use and clean.
[00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:57.360]   People love it. They love love Instagram and people don't love Facebook.
[00:40:57.360 --> 00:41:02.360]   People love to use Facebook because the people that they love are on Facebook.
[00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:06.360]   But you'll never hear the phrase Facebook fanboy. Nobody's a fan of Facebook.
[00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:07.360]   No, that's true.
[00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:14.360]   And big companies can't engineer affection unless you're Apple.
[00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:27.360]   And so I think this is the beginning of a trend where companies will be purchased and highly valued because they've been able to engender super high user affinity.
[00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:38.360]   And that's what Instagram is. They're buying the love of 30-35 million people, but they're buying the ability to be lovable.
[00:41:38.360 --> 00:41:44.360]   And I think a lot of this, a lot of the Instagram pixie dust is going to end up in their mobile apps.
[00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:49.360]   And the hope is that it will make people love Facebook more.
[00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:52.360]   So they're buying a soul. This is for Paul of the Yorker piece.
[00:41:52.360 --> 00:41:55.360]   He said that basically Facebook is buying a soul.
[00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:58.360]   The soul of a startup, a thing that people just love.
[00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:01.360]   Can you really buy that though? Don't you kill it when you buy it?
[00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:07.360]   That's a good question, Leo. I tend to think, no, I mean, I saw a lot of people write a lot of pieces about how to export all their people.
[00:42:07.360 --> 00:42:13.360]   Or how to export all your photos from Instagram and close your account once they heard about the Facebook acquisition.
[00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:17.360]   But you know what, Gina, that's what got me pissed off.
[00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:23.360]   There's this digi-snob movement that as soon as whole Facebook touches it, well, I'm going to kill it.
[00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:27.360]   You know, 845 million people against you.
[00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:29.360]   How out of touch are you with what's going on?
[00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:32.360]   How uncurious are you about what the world was using?
[00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:39.360]   I mean, kill it, kill it. I don't care. But to make this announcement that I'm going to unsubscribe to you,
[00:42:39.360 --> 00:42:43.360]   or I'm going to kill this account, or I'm going to do that, I don't care.
[00:42:43.360 --> 00:42:46.360]   The business is still growing. It doesn't frankly need you.
[00:42:46.360 --> 00:42:48.360]   If there's too many of you, that's true.
[00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:52.360]   But this idea that Facebook has kudis, I think it's kind of ridiculous.
[00:42:52.360 --> 00:42:57.360]   Facebook may well ruin it. You know, everything that AOL bought, everything that Yahoo bought got ruined.
[00:42:57.360 --> 00:43:02.360]   But Zuckerberg does do things differently. And he said in his message, it was very important,
[00:43:02.360 --> 00:43:07.360]   that he plans to keep this running independently.
[00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:12.360]   He still wants it to be part of an ability of the ecosystem to send to other services.
[00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:15.360]   I don't think this is the creation of a unified social network.
[00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:18.360]   I think it's the creation of the first social conglomerate.
[00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:26.360]   Well, note that he said that he would keep it running separately, but he didn't say that we're not going to make Facebook more like this also.
[00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:27.360]   That's okay.
[00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:39.360]   But back to the point, I think that you can actually purchase love like this, because the reason people love Instagram is because of how it makes them feel.
[00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:45.360]   People love their lives. They love their cat, their friends, they see a sunset, they're inspired by it.
[00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:52.360]   They won't want to share it. It's a human impulse to want to share the things that you're inspired by.
[00:43:52.360 --> 00:43:56.360]   And Instagram lets you go snap, make it a little arty.
[00:43:56.360 --> 00:43:59.360]   So I feel like I'm being expressive and creative, even though I'm not.
[00:43:59.360 --> 00:44:02.360]   And then click a button and everybody sees it.
[00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:05.360]   It feels really good to people.
[00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:11.360]   But okay, but I think that love is hard to earn and easy to lose.
[00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:14.360]   And I don't say that because of the kudy aspect.
[00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:16.360]   Oh, Facebook touched it. But look at Flickr.
[00:44:16.360 --> 00:44:19.360]   I think people love Flickr. Yahoo bought it.
[00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:24.360]   I still use Flickr. I use Flickr a lot. But Yahoo abandoned it.
[00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:29.360]   So my love for Yahoo was diminished. I had not that I ever had any possible respect.
[00:44:29.360 --> 00:44:36.360]   I have for Yahoo, but that way was diminished by their abandonment of Flickr and delicious worse.
[00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:37.360]   Right.
[00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:41.360]   So you can't buy it. You can at most borrow it.
[00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:54.360]   Yeah. The other thing I think that I haven't heard very many people mention is that one reason to purchase Instagram is to prevent them from supporting Google Plus.
[00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:57.360]   Because right now it supports everything but Google Plus like a lot of things.
[00:44:57.360 --> 00:45:00.360]   So buy them before there's a right API.
[00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:02.360]   Exactly.
[00:45:02.360 --> 00:45:06.360]   Because you know, I mean, when you take a picture here, we'll do this real quickly.
[00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:10.360]   We'll take a picture of Gina because I don't, I think that's the best thing to take a picture of.
[00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:12.360]   And then I will make it arty.
[00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:20.360]   I read somebody say that these filters make everything look like it was taken in the Japanese.
[00:45:20.360 --> 00:45:21.360]   Right.
[00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:26.360]   And now I can share Twitter, Facebook, email, Flickr, four square, Tumblr, Postrous.
[00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:30.360]   Everything but where's the Google? Where's the Google? Yeah.
[00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:36.360]   And yet, and, and, and, for a couple of things, I come to mind.
[00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:42.360]   First of all, I don't think that the, that the naysayers are really important.
[00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:50.360]   I mean, after all, when Android, when there was an Android version of Instagram, it was probably the same people said, "Ew, you got Android in my iPhone."
[00:45:50.360 --> 00:45:54.360]   So those people are probably just, you know, they're not going to make a big difference.
[00:45:54.360 --> 00:46:05.360]   But I wonder, can you inject, you know, in some, now when they're making bio, biogenetically enhanced products, they inject DNA.
[00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:11.360]   Can you inject DNA from face, from Instagram into Facebook?
[00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:14.360]   Or is, I think Facebook's a juggernaut.
[00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:18.360]   I think there's only 30 people work at this, or 20 people that work at this company.
[00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:22.360]   How is that going to change the monster that is Facebook?
[00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:28.360]   Well, to your point, how did, how did the oxygen of friend feed change Facebook?
[00:46:28.360 --> 00:46:31.360]   I mean, does anybody remember a friend feed?
[00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:34.360]   It was like the, remember it was the flavor of the month and then Facebook bought it and just kind of.
[00:46:34.360 --> 00:46:39.360]   And Brett Taylor, who came, who came from friend feed, became Facebook's CTO.
[00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:42.360]   Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wasn't friend feed bought, I thought friend feed was bought.
[00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:44.360]   And friend feed was the walking dead at that point.
[00:46:44.360 --> 00:46:50.360]   Yeah, they were bought for the people. And this is, in fact, up till now, everything Facebook's done is in a choir,
[00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:55.360]   a choir, right? That doesn't work in audio, it only works when you write it.
[00:46:55.360 --> 00:47:02.360]   A-Q-U-H-I-R-E, where they would get, I'm thinking of Sam Lesson of Droppio, which was a great product.
[00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:05.360]   And they killed it because all they really wanted was Sam.
[00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:12.360]   Friend feed was a dying product, but they really just wanted Paul and Mike, obviously, they mostly wanted Brett.
[00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:15.360]   This is going to be different, I think.
[00:47:15.360 --> 00:47:17.360]   I think it's more like maps, isn't it?
[00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:20.360]   This is more like Google buying the folks who made--
[00:47:20.360 --> 00:47:22.360]   And making it a big part of Facebook.
[00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:25.360]   Because you look what they did with Sam, so I think Sam's a good example, right?
[00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:31.360]   So by hiring Sam, by buying this company, he became key to--
[00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:32.360]   Need a timeline.
[00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:33.360]   Need a timeline.
[00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:40.360]   And the best thing that can happen here is that, yes, Instagram can exist on its own,
[00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:46.360]   but I think you're right, Mike. The point is that Facebook becomes more like Instagram rather than Instagram becomes like Facebook.
[00:47:46.360 --> 00:47:47.360]   That's the point.
[00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:52.360]   But those 20 people-- and it's really not 20, it's probably Kevin's sister, and nobody else.
[00:47:52.360 --> 00:47:55.360]   If he can go in-- I guess you Sam did.
[00:47:55.360 --> 00:47:56.360]   Brett did.
[00:47:56.360 --> 00:47:57.360]   I guess you're right.
[00:47:57.360 --> 00:47:58.360]   Kind of culture.
[00:47:58.360 --> 00:48:01.360]   And they hired those other guys who were involved in timeline.
[00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:03.360]   They went and hired the brightest they could.
[00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:05.360]   I think that's part of what Zuckerberg tries to do.
[00:48:05.360 --> 00:48:11.360]   He walks them through the woods to convince them to come there, because it's part of the cult of Zuck.
[00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:13.360]   And I think that that means a bit.
[00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:17.360]   That's part of what they pride themselves on Facebook, because they're not the behemoth that Google has become.
[00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:21.360]   Culture not, if anybody offered me a billion dollars for anything.
[00:48:21.360 --> 00:48:23.360]   Including my first born.
[00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:26.360]   I'd really consider it anyway.
[00:48:26.360 --> 00:48:27.360]   I'd share it.
[00:48:27.360 --> 00:48:28.360]   Clear.
[00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:33.360]   Three days before this announcement, who got a piece of that billion dollars, who doubled their money in three days.
[00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:35.360]   That's what's really absurd.
[00:48:35.360 --> 00:48:36.360]   Yeah.
[00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:37.360]   Who's a lottery man?
[00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:38.360]   You just kind of know where you're investing.
[00:48:38.360 --> 00:48:39.360]   That's all.
[00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:42.360]   This from the founder got 400 million.
[00:48:42.360 --> 00:48:44.360]   The investors, of course, made off.
[00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:45.360]   Like, they made out like bandits.
[00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:46.360]   In fact, they had a hundred million dollar pool.
[00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:48.360]   It's divided among the remaining employees.
[00:48:48.360 --> 00:48:50.360]   So each of them is going to be a millionaire.
[00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:56.360]   This is the thing about the acquisition announcement that made me kind of crazy.
[00:48:56.360 --> 00:48:59.360]   Or this is the thing that fascinated me, or maybe galled me a little bit.
[00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:04.360]   It's like, 20 year old guy gets a one billion dollar exit.
[00:49:04.360 --> 00:49:08.360]   It's like it has such a huge impact on the technology community.
[00:49:08.360 --> 00:49:16.360]   Like the tech media, and then I think the startup community, because suddenly the whole conversation becomes about, you know, who had the most spectacular exit.
[00:49:16.360 --> 00:49:21.360]   There's all this like weird jealousy, and there's kind of the, you know, the Facebook backlash.
[00:49:21.360 --> 00:49:30.360]   And then, you know, I just think you have a lot of young people who are trying to make good products on the web, which is what we're all supposed to be trying to do, not trying to have the most spectacular billion dollar exit possible.
[00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:31.360]   Kind of get distracted.
[00:49:31.360 --> 00:49:32.360]   It is distracting.
[00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:33.360]   Yeah.
[00:49:33.360 --> 00:49:34.360]   It's a good tactic.
[00:49:34.360 --> 00:49:35.360]   I think you're way right.
[00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:36.360]   I think you're way right.
[00:49:36.360 --> 00:49:41.360]   And I think that this creates a 1% of the technology world.
[00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:43.360]   Yes, it does.
[00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:44.360]   Right.
[00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:46.360]   And that's part of the problem where we are now.
[00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:48.360]   And it skews the ethical view of it.
[00:49:48.360 --> 00:49:51.360]   If it's skewed banking, it's going to skew geeks too.
[00:49:51.360 --> 00:49:54.360]   And it's worrisome that that's where we are.
[00:49:54.360 --> 00:49:58.360]   Now, you know, I don't, I don't begrudge them getting the money they can get.
[00:49:58.360 --> 00:49:59.360]   God bless them.
[00:49:59.360 --> 00:50:00.360]   But you're right.
[00:50:00.360 --> 00:50:03.360]   What does it do to the rest of the world around them?
[00:50:03.360 --> 00:50:08.120]   Yeah, there's this very small contingent of young men, young white men who have a lot of
[00:50:08.120 --> 00:50:11.040]   money because they had, you know, they won this lottery.
[00:50:11.040 --> 00:50:13.240]   And you know, and like you said, good for them.
[00:50:13.240 --> 00:50:17.560]   It just, it makes me sad that this, that the conversation about web product development,
[00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:21.240]   you know, becomes about the exit and not, and not about, you know, making something really
[00:50:21.240 --> 00:50:22.240]   good.
[00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:23.240]   I think it's around God.
[00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:25.360]   But this has been going on since 1994 and Netscape.
[00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:26.360]   Absolutely.
[00:50:26.360 --> 00:50:30.520]   I mean, this is, this is frankly always the undercurrent in Silicon Valley is, are you going to make
[00:50:30.520 --> 00:50:31.680]   a big score?
[00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:36.960]   I like this trend because essentially a years ago, if you're a young entrepreneur, you,
[00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:42.840]   you wanted to go for that big payoff either by becoming a company with a lot of revenue
[00:50:42.840 --> 00:50:44.600]   or by selling to a larger company.
[00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:45.600]   That's always been the case.
[00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:49.920]   But in the past, you had to always demonstrate, well, not in the past since the crash of 2000,
[00:50:49.920 --> 00:50:54.560]   you had to demonstrate that you had a, you know, a business, the business plan.
[00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:55.560]   This is the revenue model.
[00:50:55.560 --> 00:50:57.480]   This is how we can make money.
[00:50:57.480 --> 00:51:00.000]   And these guys never got around to that part of it.
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:01.000]   They just created it.
[00:51:01.000 --> 00:51:03.200]   They have to free it out that everybody loved.
[00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:07.240]   And I would love to see everybody focused on creating things that everybody loves and
[00:51:07.240 --> 00:51:10.160]   stop trying to figure out how we can.
[00:51:10.160 --> 00:51:11.360]   I think sustainability matters.
[00:51:11.360 --> 00:51:15.240]   I see that disease in journalism and news and media where people say, I just want to
[00:51:15.240 --> 00:51:16.240]   do what's cool and neat.
[00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:18.640]   And they don't put any thought and sustainability.
[00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:21.000]   And so then what happens, this is where the true bubble comes in.
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:23.000]   Then they say, well, okay, I'll get bought.
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:26.880]   They won't give me any thought to it, which is really just a bad way to create a feature.
[00:51:26.880 --> 00:51:30.480]   There's no real, you know, but it isn't that what it is.
[00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:33.520]   Yeah, it is, but here's the, here's the issue.
[00:51:33.520 --> 00:51:38.000]   What we should be critical of is not the makers of, I think, Instagram, which would
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:42.760]   be critical of Facebook, that they have a structure that meant that rather than developing
[00:51:42.760 --> 00:51:46.080]   something cool and nice in-house, they had to go buy it for a billion dollars.
[00:51:46.080 --> 00:51:47.080]   I'm wrong there.
[00:51:47.080 --> 00:51:48.640]   The other thing is, I really want to go back to what Genes thinks.
[00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:54.000]   I think it's important that we have to look at the future financial structure of our world.
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:58.760]   And I've argued, and I argued this in a post about the jobs bill, not jobs, but J.O.B.S.
[00:51:58.760 --> 00:52:03.200]   The investment, which I'll talk about in a second, that we're moving from a world of
[00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:08.360]   vertical industries fully owned where you control product creation, manufacturing, marketing
[00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:10.360]   and distribution to a world of ecosystems.
[00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:12.680]   And the ecosystems, I say, that there are three layers.
[00:52:12.680 --> 00:52:14.080]   There's a platform layer.
[00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:17.320]   There's an entrepreneurial layer now made possible by the platform they were existing.
[00:52:17.320 --> 00:52:21.000]   And there's a network layer that is often necessary to get those small entrepreneurial
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:22.520]   ventures to critical mass.
[00:52:22.520 --> 00:52:23.520]   Okay?
[00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:27.600]   What's happening in our world today is all the value is falling to the platform.
[00:52:27.600 --> 00:52:31.280]   That's why Google was worth so much on Facebook and so on and Zinga.
[00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:34.520]   The entrepreneurial layer is possible to do because those platforms exist, but you're
[00:52:34.520 --> 00:52:35.520]   small.
[00:52:35.520 --> 00:52:38.160]   You're never really small until maybe you're getting a network like Glam.
[00:52:38.160 --> 00:52:42.360]   What I like about the jobs bill, apart from taking away regulation that we probably still
[00:52:42.360 --> 00:52:46.880]   do need on companies because companies and Wall Street are all screwed up, but the idea
[00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:51.720]   of being able to get funding to new ventures on their own now, easier than going through
[00:52:51.720 --> 00:52:53.720]   venture capital from crowdfunding.
[00:52:53.720 --> 00:52:59.040]   And the idea of being able to exit without having to sell out for a billion dollars or
[00:52:59.040 --> 00:53:03.160]   go IPO and you can get earlier exits and get some value out of this.
[00:53:03.160 --> 00:53:08.240]   I hope drive some value back up to the entrepreneurial layer, which is the one that Gina really
[00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:11.560]   loves and I love and that we want to encourage.
[00:53:11.560 --> 00:53:16.800]   If the only way we're encouraged that is the absolute long shot blockbuster economy.
[00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:17.960]   It becomes like Hollywood.
[00:53:17.960 --> 00:53:21.800]   A few people will make the movie that succeeds and the rest will starve.
[00:53:21.800 --> 00:53:22.800]   Okay.
[00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:25.240]   Instagram, we want to Graham did it.
[00:53:25.240 --> 00:53:26.240]   I'm sorry.
[00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:28.080]   I'm sorry to interrupt you Jeff.
[00:53:28.080 --> 00:53:29.960]   Instagram did everything right and they stand.
[00:53:29.960 --> 00:53:31.160]   It's great that they're being rewarded.
[00:53:31.160 --> 00:53:32.960]   They have a very lean operation.
[00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:35.000]   No, I understand that.
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:36.000]   But but we want the decision.
[00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:37.000]   I think Gina, right?
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:38.160]   You're not criticizing them.
[00:53:38.160 --> 00:53:41.040]   You're criticizing the structure that this is leading to.
[00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:47.040]   But the billion dollar, the unusual billion dollar purchase price, the unexratically unexpected
[00:53:47.040 --> 00:53:49.520]   is a reward for having done everything right.
[00:53:49.520 --> 00:53:55.000]   If this had never happened, Instagram would have still been very, very successful.
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:57.000]   There's 10 ways they could have been very successful.
[00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:58.000]   Yeah.
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:53:59.000]   But I don't think that's the only gauge.
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:03.320]   You can also be Mark Cuban who basically did nothing and got a huge amount of money
[00:54:03.320 --> 00:54:07.880]   from a very stupid company that in turn then turned around what they bought for $5 billion.
[00:54:07.880 --> 00:54:12.240]   And you know, the fact that you got a lot of money is not necessarily the reward or quality.
[00:54:12.240 --> 00:54:15.960]   What Gina I think is going to and I want to hear back from Gina is that I think that
[00:54:15.960 --> 00:54:20.000]   there's an ethic that you want to see rewarded, right Gina?
[00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:21.000]   Yes.
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:24.000]   And it's got to be more than just why made something nice.
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:28.120]   It's got to be that I can have a sustainable business out of this.
[00:54:28.120 --> 00:54:29.600]   I can raise funds to do it.
[00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:32.160]   I can take some money off the table to buy my house.
[00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:35.240]   I can make something good and be good and have a business.
[00:54:35.240 --> 00:54:38.600]   And we want lots of that happening rather than a few blockbusters.
[00:54:38.600 --> 00:54:39.600]   Gina, I'm sorry.
[00:54:39.600 --> 00:54:40.600]   Yeah.
[00:54:40.600 --> 00:54:42.760]   I mean, I, my last book to New York, I visited a startup.
[00:54:42.760 --> 00:54:45.560]   I won't say which one, but it's been in business for almost 10 years.
[00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:48.040]   It's profitable, doing great.
[00:54:48.040 --> 00:54:51.400]   And the founder said to me, well, you know, I feel just so old and slow.
[00:54:51.400 --> 00:54:56.200]   Like when you look at things like Zinga and I bet, and I bet now, you know, OMG pop and
[00:54:56.200 --> 00:54:57.720]   I bet now he'd say Instagram.
[00:54:57.720 --> 00:55:03.000]   And it was like, wait a second, 10 years in business, you know, with a profitable internet
[00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:05.800]   business, media company and the internet, that's something to be proud of.
[00:55:05.800 --> 00:55:06.800]   That's something to celebrate.
[00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:10.560]   I only hope that, you know, 10 years, my company will still be around and I'll still
[00:55:10.560 --> 00:55:13.600]   be passionate about it and I'll still be doing meaningful, interesting things on the web.
[00:55:13.600 --> 00:55:15.960]   And I will have made something that people love.
[00:55:15.960 --> 00:55:18.960]   You know, I, I listen, Instagram is an awesome app.
[00:55:18.960 --> 00:55:19.960]   I loved it.
[00:55:19.960 --> 00:55:22.640]   They made an incredible product experience.
[00:55:22.640 --> 00:55:25.200]   Those guys did a great job and good for them and they're billion dollars.
[00:55:25.200 --> 00:55:29.720]   It just, it makes me sad that it kind of sets up this goal or this, this standard, you know,
[00:55:29.720 --> 00:55:33.640]   that people are like, well, if I don't, you know, if I'm not, I don't build this blockbuster
[00:55:33.640 --> 00:55:38.720]   product in two years, by the time I'm 26 and sell out for a billion dollars and I failed.
[00:55:38.720 --> 00:55:39.720]   Well, they should.
[00:55:39.720 --> 00:55:40.720]   Good.
[00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:42.800]   Listen to Gina entrepreneurs.
[00:55:42.800 --> 00:55:44.800]   You haven't failed.
[00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:45.800]   Yeah.
[00:55:45.800 --> 00:55:47.880]   Well, you know, you haven't failed.
[00:55:47.880 --> 00:55:49.400]   You've built something good and you know what?
[00:55:49.400 --> 00:55:55.680]   Most people like 99.9% will never have a big payday like Kevin sister mad.
[00:55:55.680 --> 00:55:56.680]   This is really an outlier.
[00:55:56.680 --> 00:55:58.640]   But really, that's the goal, you know, that's the problem.
[00:55:58.640 --> 00:56:02.440]   It can be the goal and you know why it's good because what it does is it gets everybody
[00:56:02.440 --> 00:56:08.320]   at on a page mill road to start putting money into lots of little startups.
[00:56:08.320 --> 00:56:13.360]   Okay, but that, but yeah, but that's, that's part of the issue is that they expect that
[00:56:13.360 --> 00:56:17.720]   kind of their definition of failure is not the definition.
[00:56:17.720 --> 00:56:23.040]   They know, they know that there, it's a long shot, but it means there's more money to invest
[00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:25.440]   because there's more money to be made.
[00:56:25.440 --> 00:56:28.920]   Most of most entrepreneurs are like me where I'm just going to be happy if I could survive
[00:56:28.920 --> 00:56:31.440]   a year or two and make a profitable business.
[00:56:31.440 --> 00:56:32.680]   That's the way most people think.
[00:56:32.680 --> 00:56:35.120]   I don't think it's going to change how people see you.
[00:56:35.120 --> 00:56:36.440]   I'm going to go walk you for a second.
[00:56:36.440 --> 00:56:40.000]   I read a, I read a great book I just blogged about called the institutional revolution.
[00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:41.200]   It's pretty wonky.
[00:56:41.200 --> 00:56:46.400]   No Gutenberg in it, but it tries from an economics perspective to explain why there were these
[00:56:46.400 --> 00:56:52.640]   ridiculous institutions in pre modern England of the aristocracy and bought army commissions
[00:56:52.640 --> 00:56:55.440]   and dueling and private roads.
[00:56:55.440 --> 00:56:58.920]   And really interesting analysis that said before you could measure performance, you
[00:56:58.920 --> 00:57:00.560]   had to get trust in other means.
[00:57:00.560 --> 00:57:03.440]   You got means and things like he calls a hostage capital.
[00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:10.360]   You sent your daughter to the court and if you screwed up, you couldn't see her again.
[00:57:10.360 --> 00:57:14.920]   You made a huge estate because you invested in that.
[00:57:14.920 --> 00:57:18.200]   Point is, then other means came along to measure.
[00:57:18.200 --> 00:57:21.240]   People could find longitude and latitude.
[00:57:21.240 --> 00:57:22.320]   We had clocks that worked.
[00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:23.320]   We had measurements.
[00:57:23.320 --> 00:57:24.840]   You could measure success in new ways.
[00:57:24.840 --> 00:57:26.760]   And so the institutions changed.
[00:57:26.760 --> 00:57:30.640]   What Gina's talking about here really I think is that we are creating the new institutions
[00:57:30.640 --> 00:57:31.640]   of society.
[00:57:31.640 --> 00:57:36.340]   The technology industry is creating new institutions and how they operate under what ethics and
[00:57:36.340 --> 00:57:38.760]   mores and with what goals.
[00:57:38.760 --> 00:57:44.520]   We have to stand back and say if a billion dollars becomes the goal, again, God bless
[00:57:44.520 --> 00:57:47.720]   Facebook and God bless Instagram, not complaining about them.
[00:57:47.720 --> 00:57:48.880]   What are we building?
[00:57:48.880 --> 00:57:50.280]   What's the society?
[00:57:50.280 --> 00:57:56.960]   We want it to build a society where all of the above is celebrated and possible and
[00:57:56.960 --> 00:57:57.960]   common.
[00:57:57.960 --> 00:58:00.040]   And in fact, that's exactly what we have.
[00:58:00.040 --> 00:58:03.200]   That's in lots of small entrepreneurs and technology are building companies and making
[00:58:03.200 --> 00:58:07.480]   going concerns of it and doing very well and it's fantastic.
[00:58:07.480 --> 00:58:12.360]   The thing that excites me about these big splashy billion dollar payoffs is it's something
[00:58:12.360 --> 00:58:16.320]   that inspires high school students to want to become entrepreneurs.
[00:58:16.320 --> 00:58:20.760]   Because starting a little company and making a nice profit off in the corner doing something
[00:58:20.760 --> 00:58:23.600]   is awesome.
[00:58:23.600 --> 00:58:25.160]   And there's so much that everybody should try to do.
[00:58:25.160 --> 00:58:26.160]   That's like saying.
[00:58:26.160 --> 00:58:27.160]   That's like saying.
[00:58:27.160 --> 00:58:28.160]   Does that matter?
[00:58:28.160 --> 00:58:29.160]   How many?
[00:58:29.160 --> 00:58:30.160]   It's the lottery.
[00:58:30.160 --> 00:58:31.160]   People buy lottery tickets.
[00:58:31.160 --> 00:58:32.920]   Who bought mega millions tickets?
[00:58:32.920 --> 00:58:35.120]   Everybody even even my smart employees.
[00:58:35.120 --> 00:58:37.920]   That is a terrible, terrible thing.
[00:58:37.920 --> 00:58:38.920]   Sorry.
[00:58:38.920 --> 00:58:40.000]   But look it.
[00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:44.760]   I think both entrepreneurs and investors know that this is an outlier.
[00:58:44.760 --> 00:58:49.080]   It's the outlier that makes people feel good and say, gee, we could buy it, you know,
[00:58:49.080 --> 00:58:51.200]   like win the lottery ticket.
[00:58:51.200 --> 00:58:54.080]   And I don't think I don't see any real harm done here.
[00:58:54.080 --> 00:58:59.280]   So you're making the basketball in the ghetto argument, which is that very few can make
[00:58:59.280 --> 00:59:02.640]   the pro teams, but if many hope to, then it's good.
[00:59:02.640 --> 00:59:06.320]   Well, in fact, the reality is that a lot of young people think the only way to make
[00:59:06.320 --> 00:59:12.880]   it in the world that they either have to become a superstar, a singer or a singer or Beyonce
[00:59:12.880 --> 00:59:17.200]   or something like that, or they have to become a major sports person or they have to be famous
[00:59:17.200 --> 00:59:18.760]   or nothing.
[00:59:18.760 --> 00:59:22.400]   It doesn't take no, but we're dealing with a smart class of people.
[00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:24.800]   So, you know, the tech community is smart.
[00:59:24.800 --> 00:59:25.960]   They're not stupid.
[00:59:25.960 --> 00:59:27.960]   They know that this is an outlier.
[00:59:27.960 --> 00:59:30.360]   They're not, they understand what Gina's saying.
[00:59:30.360 --> 00:59:33.880]   You should build a company, you should build value, you should do, you're giving them no
[00:59:33.880 --> 00:59:34.880]   credit.
[00:59:34.880 --> 00:59:35.880]   They're not, they're smart.
[00:59:35.880 --> 00:59:38.720]   They know this isn't, they're not going to get a billion dollars.
[00:59:38.720 --> 00:59:39.880]   That might happen.
[00:59:39.880 --> 00:59:43.480]   It gives them a little hope, a little something to dream about, but almost everybody who starts
[00:59:43.480 --> 00:59:48.760]   a company, I would guarantee you, is just trying to make something good and make something
[00:59:48.760 --> 00:59:50.800]   that last, make something profitable.
[00:59:50.800 --> 00:59:56.240]   Yes, we all think about our big exit, but that doesn't change how you do things, does
[00:59:56.240 --> 00:59:57.240]   it?
[00:59:57.240 --> 00:59:59.600]   I mean, I think you still try to add value.
[00:59:59.600 --> 01:00:01.000]   I hope so.
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:05.920]   I hope that young entrepreneurs are not aiming for the hockey stick, big exit, you know, crazy.
[01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:09.080]   I hope that people want to build businesses that last.
[01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:12.320]   I just think that stories like this, they get the amount of hack that they do and you know,
[01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:13.760]   it's a billion dollars, it's a big number.
[01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:14.760]   I understand.
[01:00:14.760 --> 01:00:15.920]   I'm not blaming the media.
[01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:17.960]   I just, it seemed like a really big distraction.
[01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:21.920]   I mean, at one point, I had the closed Twitter because I just couldn't, you know, the joking,
[01:00:21.920 --> 01:00:24.600]   the star, the commentary, the opinions, the, you know, the people back.
[01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:26.440]   It sure gets a lot of attention when that never.
[01:00:26.440 --> 01:00:27.440]   It gets a lot of attention.
[01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:31.240]   By the way, if it had been 900 million, it wouldn't have gotten that much attention.
[01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:32.240]   It would not.
[01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:34.480]   It's one billion that makes such a big deal.
[01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:35.480]   It is.
[01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:38.360]   And you know, and my fantasy, and I have no idea how this actually happened, but my fantasy
[01:00:38.360 --> 01:00:41.160]   is this, that Facebook went to Instagram and said, "Okay, we want to buy you from this
[01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:42.160]   much."
[01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:43.160]   Instagram said, "No way."
[01:00:43.160 --> 01:00:44.640]   And they said, "We want to buy you from this much."
[01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:45.640]   Instagram said, "No way.
[01:00:45.640 --> 01:00:46.800]   You cannot afford us.
[01:00:46.800 --> 01:00:48.200]   We care about our product too much."
[01:00:48.200 --> 01:00:49.680]   And it got up to a billion dollars, right?
[01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:50.680]   Like everybody has their price.
[01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:51.680]   I think that's what happens.
[01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:54.600]   And it makes me really happy that Instagram's price is a billion dollars.
[01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:55.600]   That's great.
[01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:56.600]   That's exactly what happened.
[01:00:56.600 --> 01:00:57.600]   That's the price we sell now.
[01:00:57.600 --> 01:00:59.000]   That makes me happy, right?
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.160]   Because they, you know, they're, they're last round.
[01:01:01.160 --> 01:01:03.200]   They were valued at 100 million.
[01:01:03.200 --> 01:01:07.840]   Some, some wild, crazy people a few months ago said 500 million.
[01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:08.840]   It's in a way.
[01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:10.840]   Based on the last round, I think the last round was valued at that.
[01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:15.680]   It's clearly more than, than you would normally, you, you're not going to say, "I'll
[01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:17.000]   take a billion dollars."
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:18.000]   You might say it in jest.
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:22.240]   And then when Mark Zuckerberg says, "Okay."
[01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:24.200]   And who's going to go home then and say, "Uh-huh.
[01:01:24.200 --> 01:01:25.200]   I'm proud of myself.
[01:01:25.200 --> 01:01:26.800]   I turned down a billion dollars today."
[01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:29.400]   Do you want to the moon?
[01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:31.000]   That's ground for divorce.
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:36.080]   And now I'm going to get Jeff wired up, round up here because it's with, at a billion dollars,
[01:01:36.080 --> 01:01:40.080]   it's worth 50 million dollars more than the New York Times.
[01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:41.080]   Yes.
[01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:45.800]   The New York Times market cap is 950 million dollars.
[01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:50.760]   The 551 day old company is worth more than 100 plus.
[01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:52.320]   But it was, it was for users.
[01:01:52.320 --> 01:01:54.000]   No, you're right.
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:57.320]   30 million is more than whatever than one or two million that read the New York Times.
[01:01:57.320 --> 01:01:58.320]   I would argue...
[01:01:58.320 --> 01:02:01.000]   No, they have a large online audience.
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:02.240]   That's true online speaker.
[01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:04.960]   They actually do have, they probably have about, they have probably have more than 30
[01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:05.960]   billion.
[01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:06.960]   Yeah.
[01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:07.960]   Yeah.
[01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:14.600]   And you know what we don't know, this could be a broadcast.com moment.
[01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:20.520]   We could be watching Kevin's system and the port, you know, jumping onto the floor at
[01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:25.440]   the Portland Trailblazers game, making an ass of himself, spending his money like Mark
[01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:32.200]   Cuban in 10 years and everybody will go, "Remember, yeah, remember when Facebook bought..."
[01:02:32.200 --> 01:02:34.760]   What was the name of his company for like all that money?
[01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:35.760]   Whatever happened to that?
[01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:36.760]   Like, yeah.
[01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:38.560]   Like Instagram, I'm saying 10 years from now.
[01:02:38.560 --> 01:02:39.560]   Oh, right, right, right.
[01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:41.920]   Remember Facebook bought, what was that?
[01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:42.920]   It was a film.
[01:02:42.920 --> 01:02:43.920]   It'll be on dance.
[01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:45.000]   It'll be on Etsy with the stars.
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.400]   I'll tell you who's really feeling bad right now.
[01:02:47.400 --> 01:02:51.040]   Do you remember a company called Text America?
[01:02:51.040 --> 01:02:53.000]   It was a Mo-blogging company.
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.280]   Had a lot of attention about eight years ago.
[01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:56.280]   We were all doing it.
[01:02:56.280 --> 01:03:00.400]   We were all taking pictures on our, on our cell phones and putting one text.
[01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:02.600]   It was Instagram.
[01:03:02.600 --> 01:03:04.920]   It just was a little too early and they couldn't make it.
[01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:05.920]   How do you think it gets them?
[01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:08.240]   It feels like, yeah, there you go.
[01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:10.240]   Yeah, well, a lot of this is timing, right?
[01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:14.840]   Timing connections, I mean, it's talent, but then there's a lot of other factors.
[01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:16.480]   But they tried to monetize.
[01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:17.560]   Right.
[01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:19.400]   That was their mistake.
[01:03:19.400 --> 01:03:20.400]   So...
[01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:21.400]   Oh, no, no.
[01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:22.400]   That's not how it's going.
[01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:24.320]   Too early, too early.
[01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:26.560]   Nothing wrong with monetization, but just clearly.
[01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:28.520]   Build quality first.
[01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:30.520]   Worry about monetization later.
[01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:34.800]   That's actually okay, Gina, because that fits your model because they're not trying
[01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:37.000]   to say, let's make money right away.
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:38.440]   Let's build a great product first.
[01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:40.240]   Let's build a great community first.
[01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:41.240]   Okay.
[01:03:41.240 --> 01:03:44.040]   As long as we can survive, let's build a great community.
[01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:45.880]   And they were frugal about it.
[01:03:45.880 --> 01:03:46.880]   That's the thing.
[01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:47.880]   Yeah.
[01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:48.880]   It's underappreciated.
[01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:51.320]   For a long time, Instagram was just those two guys.
[01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:53.320]   I remember we interviewed him.
[01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:54.680]   We interviewed Kevin.
[01:03:54.680 --> 01:03:55.920]   And we said, "Where's the Android product?"
[01:03:55.920 --> 01:03:56.920]   This was a year ago.
[01:03:56.920 --> 01:03:59.120]   And he said, "It's just the two of us.
[01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:00.120]   We don't have time.
[01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:02.240]   We're just two of us."
[01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:10.280]   Well, Jake thought that actually among his friends, my son, Jake, that people were upset
[01:04:10.280 --> 01:04:14.600]   about the Android coming up because part of the allure of Instagram was that you had
[01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:16.960]   to have an iPhone to have it.
[01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:17.960]   Absolutely.
[01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:19.320]   And that was part of what made it limited and special.
[01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:21.320]   That's why I was sexy.
[01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:22.320]   Yeah.
[01:04:22.320 --> 01:04:29.400]   So Patty Power, who is apparently a very well-known Irish bookie, is taking odds on Facebook's
[01:04:29.400 --> 01:04:34.040]   next acquisition and Four-Screws leading with four-to-one odds.
[01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:37.480]   The long odds, my space.
[01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:40.320]   YouTube is 40 to one.
[01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:41.880]   Friends reunited.
[01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:42.880]   It's an English.
[01:04:42.880 --> 01:04:43.880]   It's English.
[01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:44.880]   Yeah.
[01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:45.880]   Same thing with a couple of these.
[01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:47.120]   That's the Real Class Bates.com.
[01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:48.120]   Yeah.
[01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:49.360]   Tumblr 25 to one.
[01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:50.360]   Spotify 7 to one.
[01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:52.320]   I think Spotify should be higher.
[01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:54.240]   I disagree with Evernote being on that list.
[01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:55.720]   I don't think they're going to go forever.
[01:04:55.720 --> 01:04:56.720]   No, we're not.
[01:04:56.720 --> 01:04:57.720]   92 forever.
[01:04:57.720 --> 01:04:58.720]   Yeah, I agree.
[01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:02.600]   I tell us the name of that book because you just held it up so people on video saw it,
[01:05:02.600 --> 01:05:03.600]   but we didn't hear it.
[01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:04.600]   Oh, sorry.
[01:05:04.600 --> 01:05:07.120]   It's called The Institutional Revolution by Douglas Allen.
[01:05:07.120 --> 01:05:08.720]   It's pretty walkie, folks.
[01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:09.960]   And I blogged about it.
[01:05:09.960 --> 01:05:10.960]   No Gutenberg.
[01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:11.960]   You know of any Gutenberg book?
[01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:14.920]   Yeah, it would be a good book about Gutenberg.
[01:05:14.920 --> 01:05:20.440]   The best Gutenberg, the authoritative one that's out of print is by Albert Capar, K-A-P-R.
[01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:22.800]   You tried, Mike.
[01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:23.800]   You tried.
[01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:26.440]   You did your best.
[01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:27.760]   It's called Gutenberg the Geek.
[01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:29.760]   And it's only 99 cents.
[01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:30.760]   99 cents.
[01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:33.120]   You tried, Mike.
[01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:34.120]   I walked out.
[01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:37.720]   But while we're at it, if you're really into Gutenberg after having read my thing, you want
[01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:38.720]   to read something really good.
[01:05:38.720 --> 01:05:41.520]   John Mann's Gutenberg biography is very good.
[01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:42.520]   I will read that.
[01:05:42.520 --> 01:05:43.520]   I will read that.
[01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:44.520]   I love it.
[01:05:44.520 --> 01:05:46.760]   Facebook has never got a try.
[01:05:46.760 --> 01:05:48.760]   He's never got a try.
[01:05:48.760 --> 01:05:50.720]   No, this is why we love Jeff.
[01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:55.760]   Well, actually the best Gutenberg book would be glad you asked.
[01:05:55.760 --> 01:05:57.760]   All right, busted.
[01:05:57.760 --> 01:06:03.760]   They only people I want on Twitter, on any of our shows are people like that.
[01:06:03.760 --> 01:06:08.880]   They don't know nothing about promotions or marketing.
[01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:11.200]   We just want to, we just want to inform.
[01:06:11.200 --> 01:06:12.680]   That's all.
[01:06:12.680 --> 01:06:13.680]   We're just here to the class.
[01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:14.680]   Go to gimbals.
[01:06:14.680 --> 01:06:15.680]   Exactly.
[01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:22.680]   I want to tell you about Squarespace.com, the secret behind exceptional, ex-sectional
[01:06:22.680 --> 01:06:27.680]   website, if you go to squarespace.com, here's a perfect example.
[01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:29.560]   Squarespace could make this so much harder.
[01:06:29.560 --> 01:06:31.960]   They could say, "Give me a credit card number."
[01:06:31.960 --> 01:06:36.400]   Two weeks, but no, if you want to try Squarespace, all you do is go to squarespace.com.
[01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:38.800]   Click a big green button that says "Try it for you.
[01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:40.200]   You don't need a credit card.
[01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:44.720]   You need your first name, your last name, an email address, the name of your site, and
[01:06:44.720 --> 01:06:45.920]   your password."
[01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:48.840]   For the next two weeks, you get the whole thing.
[01:06:48.840 --> 01:06:52.080]   Everything Squarespace does.
[01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:53.560]   I'm telling you, this is great.
[01:06:53.560 --> 01:06:55.560]   It's hosting, of course, the best hosting out.
[01:06:55.560 --> 01:06:56.880]   There really is the best.
[01:06:56.880 --> 01:06:58.800]   People always ask me, "What's the best hosting?"
[01:06:58.800 --> 01:07:01.440]   The thing is, it's tied to the software, and there's an advantage to that.
[01:07:01.440 --> 01:07:04.520]   For instance, it's always up to date, always secure.
[01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:07.200]   They take care of that for you, fully manage your server.
[01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:09.080]   You don't have to worry about it.
[01:07:09.080 --> 01:07:12.720]   Then you create a website on top of it using their incredible software.
[01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:18.760]   The templates, they've just added 13 new template redesigns, 85 new style options.
[01:07:18.760 --> 01:07:21.880]   They've got two brand new templates, and the templates are gorgeous.
[01:07:21.880 --> 01:07:26.520]   It's great, is they're just the starting point, because as soon as you pick a template, you
[01:07:26.520 --> 01:07:30.480]   start dragging and dropping and adding and changing fonts.
[01:07:30.480 --> 01:07:31.480]   Did I mention fonts?
[01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:35.560]   Over 300 fonts available through the Google Font Library.
[01:07:35.560 --> 01:07:40.320]   If you are super sophisticated and you want to do CSS, of course you can, but you don't
[01:07:40.320 --> 01:07:46.480]   have to, but you will like the fact that they have a built-in ID, a CSS editor that colors
[01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:54.840]   the code and gives you everything you need, including undo, redo, insert style variables.
[01:07:54.840 --> 01:07:56.840]   It's really sweet.
[01:07:56.840 --> 01:08:02.560]   They have three color themes available for editing, so you can choose the color you want.
[01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:04.080]   They theme their editor.
[01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:05.080]   How about that?
[01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:08.600]   But you don't have to, I hesitate mentioning that because I don't want people to go, "Oh,
[01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:09.600]   yes, that's what."
[01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:10.600]   You don't have to use that.
[01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:15.960]   In fact, if you go on the example site to take a look at the various sites that are
[01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:19.320]   built with Squarespace, 90% of these, no customization.
[01:08:19.320 --> 01:08:24.240]   They're straight out of the box, but the beauty of this is they all look different.
[01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:28.880]   For e-commerce, for photographers, for portfolios, for artists, you cannot bring a Squarespace
[01:08:28.880 --> 01:08:29.880]   site down.
[01:08:29.880 --> 01:08:34.400]   The best hosting, the best software, the best stuff free, just go to squarespace.com,
[01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:35.560]   click the green button.
[01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:40.360]   If you decide you want to buy, let me show you this because they've updated the pricing.
[01:08:40.360 --> 01:08:41.360]   It's new.
[01:08:41.360 --> 01:08:43.400]   I think it's very simplified, very streamlined.
[01:08:43.400 --> 01:08:46.640]   It's basically two prices.
[01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:47.840]   Eight dollars is the standard.
[01:08:47.840 --> 01:08:50.280]   Eight dollars a month, built annually.
[01:08:50.280 --> 01:08:53.400]   Sixteen dollars a month for the unlimited, built annually.
[01:08:53.400 --> 01:08:56.400]   They also have month to month plans if you just want to go month to month.
[01:08:56.400 --> 01:08:58.760]   I do suggest the annual plan because I'm going to give you an offer code that'll give
[01:08:58.760 --> 01:08:59.760]   you 10% off.
[01:08:59.760 --> 01:09:03.280]   If you get the annual plan, you will save a lot of money.
[01:09:03.280 --> 01:09:09.360]   Twig 4, TWIG and the number 4 gives you 10% off your first purchase on a new account.
[01:09:09.360 --> 01:09:13.800]   Squarespace is fantastic.
[01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:14.800]   Highly recommend it.
[01:09:14.800 --> 01:09:15.800]   Give it a try today.
[01:09:15.800 --> 01:09:16.800]   We know you will like it.
[01:09:16.800 --> 01:09:17.800]   Mike Elgin is here of Elgin.com.
[01:09:17.800 --> 01:09:22.840]   That's really just a link to his Google+ page.
[01:09:22.840 --> 01:09:24.320]   That's right.
[01:09:24.320 --> 01:09:27.160]   All Google+ all the time, most of the time.
[01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:28.160]   Yeah.
[01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:31.000]   Mike, were you nervous when you heard there was going to be a big redesign?
[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:35.440]   Since you are so tied into Google+, was there any little tiny bit of you nervous and says,
[01:09:35.440 --> 01:09:37.040]   "Oh, I hope they don't ruin it.
[01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:38.680]   It's my life."
[01:09:38.680 --> 01:09:46.280]   I feel that there's so many sort of beta rough edges in the old design that I was pretty optimistic
[01:09:46.280 --> 01:09:49.840]   that they would fix more than they broke.
[01:09:49.840 --> 01:09:52.680]   That's definitely the case, as far as I can tell.
[01:09:52.680 --> 01:09:55.920]   I was pretty excited and I was really pleased this morning when I saw it.
[01:09:55.920 --> 01:10:00.720]   What's your one favorite thing from your point of view?
[01:10:00.720 --> 01:10:03.160]   I just like the way the pictures look.
[01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:05.880]   Go full-bleed.
[01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:10.800]   My second one favorite thing is the performance.
[01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:12.000]   You click on the thing to type.
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.880]   You just immediately start typing.
[01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:17.800]   Everything is a little zippier and nicer.
[01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:21.000]   I just think the whole thing looks better.
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:25.500]   We're talking about how we'd love to see it be different or better.
[01:10:25.500 --> 01:10:30.040]   If you think about all of the all-purpose social networks, I don't think there's any
[01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:35.080]   question that this is the best design of any of them.
[01:10:35.080 --> 01:10:40.440]   It's better than Facebook, any general purpose social network you can think of.
[01:10:40.440 --> 01:10:45.840]   I guess it's really hard to cram all that stuff into a single page that's going to look
[01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:49.400]   good on everybody's screen, but I think this is pretty darn good.
[01:10:49.400 --> 01:10:50.400]   You talked me down.
[01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:52.400]   I feel better.
[01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:54.880]   I'm going to let it grow on me.
[01:10:54.880 --> 01:10:55.880]   Good job, Mike.
[01:10:55.880 --> 01:10:56.880]   Yeah.
[01:10:56.880 --> 01:10:57.880]   Thank you.
[01:10:57.880 --> 01:10:58.880]   Oh.
[01:10:58.880 --> 01:11:05.960]   Hi, Rez photos of Sergey Brin wearing the Google glasses.
[01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:09.560]   Not clear whether they actually do anything.
[01:11:09.560 --> 01:11:10.680]   He was at a charity event.
[01:11:10.680 --> 01:11:14.120]   Robert Scobel got some close-ups.
[01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:15.120]   Of course.
[01:11:15.120 --> 01:11:18.800]   Scobel said, "Sergie wouldn't let him use him."
[01:11:18.800 --> 01:11:20.200]   So it's unclear.
[01:11:20.200 --> 01:11:24.520]   Some in our shows say, "Oh, that's just because they don't do anything."
[01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:31.320]   But Robert said he saw light flickering on Sergey's eyes, light emitting from the glasses.
[01:11:31.320 --> 01:11:32.320]   Sergey said...
[01:11:32.320 --> 01:11:33.320]   Sergey says that all they do is reboot.
[01:11:33.320 --> 01:11:34.320]   He just reboots.
[01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:35.320]   He can take you his reboots.
[01:11:35.320 --> 01:11:37.320]   Kind of like the windows laptop.
[01:11:37.320 --> 01:11:39.000]   That's what I want.
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:40.000]   Glasses that crash.
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:44.200]   I wonder if it's going to say "aw snap" when it does.
[01:11:44.200 --> 01:11:46.200]   Would that be great?
[01:11:46.200 --> 01:11:51.000]   Oh, that's what happens when you get hit by the car because you're watching your glasses.
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:54.480]   I don't think these glasses are ever going to be a mainstream consumer.
[01:11:54.480 --> 01:11:55.480]   They're not going to be a product, by the way.
[01:11:55.480 --> 01:11:56.480]   I agree.
[01:11:56.480 --> 01:11:57.480]   I agree.
[01:11:57.480 --> 01:11:58.480]   I don't see it happening.
[01:11:58.480 --> 01:12:00.520]   Yeah, it's because it's four.
[01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:07.120]   I think eventually it'll be something really cool for verticals, for people who have policemen
[01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:10.800]   and people who have special purposes in professions.
[01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:14.240]   But for consumers, I think people think they're going to be walking around like a cyborg,
[01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:17.440]   have Terminator vision, and have all this data coming down.
[01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:19.600]   That's going to be problematic in a number of ways.
[01:12:19.600 --> 01:12:20.600]   First of all...
[01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:21.600]   But imagine this.
[01:12:21.600 --> 01:12:22.600]   What if...
[01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:23.600]   Just ask.
[01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:27.320]   If you believed as that video shows that it's on all the time, "Oh my God, I'm connected
[01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:30.840]   all the time," but what if without having to pull out your phone, without having to go
[01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:34.880]   anything, you could just say, "Oh, where do I go?"
[01:12:34.880 --> 01:12:37.400]   And you could turn it on, for instance, and get some information without having to pull
[01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:39.080]   stuff out and turn it off.
[01:12:39.080 --> 01:12:40.080]   Would that be...
[01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:41.720]   So this is like your phone, you take it in and out.
[01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:43.680]   Would that feel better to you?
[01:12:43.680 --> 01:12:48.080]   Well, first of all, it's not going to work like their video.
[01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:51.520]   They were conjuring up things and it was recognizing 100% of what they said and all
[01:12:51.520 --> 01:12:53.440]   that kind of stuff.
[01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:55.320]   And so that's not going to happen.
[01:12:55.320 --> 01:12:57.680]   In fact, showed an example in New York City.
[01:12:57.680 --> 01:13:00.360]   Google Maps does not work in New York City, period.
[01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:03.760]   It will send you to downtown when you're trying to go to downtown.
[01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:04.760]   Really?
[01:13:04.760 --> 01:13:05.760]   Yeah, oh yeah.
[01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:06.760]   Oh, it works for me all the time.
[01:13:06.760 --> 01:13:07.760]   I use it every day.
[01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:08.760]   Okay, so...
[01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:11.000]   I just got to know the secrets, man.
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:12.000]   What is the secret?
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:13.000]   You got to have it on your blog.
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:16.400]   I've got to tell it to you because you're a bunch of Californians.
[01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:17.400]   Wait a minute.
[01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:18.600]   Let me get this clear.
[01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:21.600]   I believe the Bronx is up and the battery is down.
[01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:25.720]   The people run around in the hole in the ground, right?
[01:13:25.720 --> 01:13:28.600]   If you have an iPhone, the battery is always down.
[01:13:28.600 --> 01:13:30.080]   Ooh, snap.
[01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:34.840]   The other thing that I don't think people realize is this is going to be an uncomfortable
[01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:37.200]   experience most likely.
[01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:41.240]   It's going to be kind of like 3D glasses where you can stand it for a couple of hours and
[01:13:41.240 --> 01:13:42.640]   after that, you're kind of like...
[01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:47.520]   Because it's going to be putting something into one eye and it's just going to be...
[01:13:47.520 --> 01:13:52.480]   I just can't imagine that this is going to be a comfortable, natural feeling experience.
[01:13:52.480 --> 01:13:53.480]   I just...
[01:13:53.480 --> 01:13:56.280]   I think it's going to be like a segue.
[01:13:56.280 --> 01:13:57.280]   I think it's going to be like a segue.
[01:13:57.280 --> 01:14:01.360]   I'm also excited about it, but now only policemen and street tours use them.
[01:14:01.360 --> 01:14:02.360]   You know what I mean?
[01:14:02.360 --> 01:14:04.360]   I think the glasses might be kind of a somewhat...
[01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:06.840]   Gina, you're dying to be dorky with this, aren't you?
[01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:07.840]   Oh, yeah!
[01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:09.240]   We're dying to dork.
[01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:13.040]   I think Gina should do a Google Glasses tours of Brooklyn.
[01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:14.840]   Where'd it go?
[01:14:14.840 --> 01:14:17.240]   Me and Zoey Deschanel, dorkable.
[01:14:17.240 --> 01:14:18.240]   Dorkable!
[01:14:18.240 --> 01:14:19.240]   I'll do it.
[01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:20.240]   Absolutely.
[01:14:20.240 --> 01:14:22.440]   But I think that the word factor is going to come into it.
[01:14:22.440 --> 01:14:23.440]   I really do.
[01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:25.760]   Especially in the States of New York, you're going to get mugged if you have those things
[01:14:25.760 --> 01:14:26.760]   on your head.
[01:14:26.760 --> 01:14:27.760]   Oh, yeah.
[01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:28.760]   Instantly.
[01:14:28.760 --> 01:14:29.760]   What about the creepy factor?
[01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:30.760]   You...
[01:14:30.760 --> 01:14:31.760]   People don't know if you're videotaping.
[01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:32.760]   Japan.
[01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:34.160]   We're safer now.
[01:14:34.160 --> 01:14:35.320]   That doesn't happen now.
[01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:37.800]   You know, people walk around with iPhones and we're okay.
[01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:38.800]   You're right.
[01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:39.800]   You're right.
[01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:41.040]   Don't take your iPhones out.
[01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:42.040]   Now we do.
[01:14:42.040 --> 01:14:47.840]   Not if you're in London, your iPhone is gone if you have a white headphones.
[01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:51.480]   I don't know if I can still, you might just get beaten up.
[01:14:51.480 --> 01:14:52.880]   Hey, hey, hey.
[01:14:52.880 --> 01:14:56.800]   You've got jellyfish and other crap in that water with on you.
[01:14:56.800 --> 01:14:58.520]   We don't have these problems now.
[01:14:58.520 --> 01:14:59.720]   You know what?
[01:14:59.720 --> 01:15:02.400]   There's no squeegee men either anymore.
[01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:03.400]   It's okay now.
[01:15:03.400 --> 01:15:04.400]   New York is safe.
[01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:05.400]   But you know what?
[01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:06.400]   That's the secret.
[01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:10.040]   We don't want all you Californians coming with your billion dollar buyouts and all your
[01:15:10.040 --> 01:15:11.040]   people stop.
[01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:14.280]   We'll build our own world here.
[01:15:14.280 --> 01:15:15.280]   Wow.
[01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:16.280]   You got it.
[01:15:16.280 --> 01:15:19.040]   I completely lost control of this show.
[01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:23.440]   Hey, did you like the Edward Miberidge Google Doodle a couple of days ago?
[01:15:23.440 --> 01:15:25.080]   I can't show it because I guess it's gone.
[01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:26.080]   But I just loved it.
[01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:30.120]   It was the horses and it would click on it and it would go faster and faster.
[01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:32.120]   Is there an archive of Google Doodle?
[01:15:32.120 --> 01:15:33.120]   Is there?
[01:15:33.120 --> 01:15:34.120]   I just loved it.
[01:15:34.120 --> 01:15:35.120]   I think there is.
[01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:36.120]   Google.
[01:15:36.120 --> 01:15:37.120]   Chatroom.
[01:15:37.120 --> 01:15:41.200]   I've told that Google Doodle archive, they would have that for me.
[01:15:41.200 --> 01:15:47.000]   Yes, there is Google.com/Seek and you shall get search results.
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:48.160]   Oh, here it is.
[01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:50.160]   Edward Miberidge is 100.
[01:15:50.160 --> 01:15:56.560]   He's the guy who photographed the horse to prove a bet that the horse at some point had
[01:15:56.560 --> 01:15:58.520]   all four who's off the ground.
[01:15:58.520 --> 01:16:00.080]   You know whose horse that was?
[01:16:00.080 --> 01:16:01.080]   Whose.
[01:16:01.080 --> 01:16:03.320]   Stanford, the founder of Stanford University.
[01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:04.320]   Oh, Lee was Stanford.
[01:16:04.320 --> 01:16:07.120]   He was the place on the grounds of Stanford University in Palo Alto.
[01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:09.400]   I just think that's a great deal.
[01:16:09.400 --> 01:16:17.080]   Leo, if you go to twitter.com/smartarg, it's a really neat, similar thing.
[01:16:17.080 --> 01:16:18.080]   Really neat use of Twitter.
[01:16:18.080 --> 01:16:19.080]   I don't know if you guys have seen this.
[01:16:19.080 --> 01:16:20.080]   Smartarg.
[01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:21.080]   ARG.
[01:16:21.080 --> 01:16:22.080]   ARG.
[01:16:22.080 --> 01:16:23.080]   Yep.
[01:16:23.080 --> 01:16:24.080]   So, ARG.
[01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:25.080]   So, ARG.
[01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:26.080]   Me, Métis.
[01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:27.080]   So, uh...
[01:16:27.080 --> 01:16:28.080]   Once a Flee Loads.
[01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:31.680]   Smart Argentina, no, I've got the wrong one.
[01:16:31.680 --> 01:16:32.680]   Yeah, no, that's right.
[01:16:32.680 --> 01:16:33.680]   That's right.
[01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:36.920]   Press J continuously and move down the page.
[01:16:36.920 --> 01:16:40.280]   It's a really cool, uh, Adam, use of animation.
[01:16:40.280 --> 01:16:41.280]   Oh, I see.
[01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:42.280]   I have to, um...
[01:16:42.280 --> 01:16:43.280]   Yeah, so, press J.
[01:16:43.280 --> 01:16:44.280]   Like, use the...
[01:16:44.280 --> 01:16:45.280]   Something's wrong.
[01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:46.280]   Maybe it doesn't...
[01:16:46.280 --> 01:16:47.280]   I'm not on Chrome, that's why.
[01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:48.280]   Ah.
[01:16:48.280 --> 01:16:49.280]   So, I have to do space.
[01:16:49.280 --> 01:16:50.280]   Oh, wow.
[01:16:50.280 --> 01:16:51.280]   Oh, wow.
[01:16:51.280 --> 01:16:52.280]   That's cool.
[01:16:52.280 --> 01:16:53.920]   Yeah, so you can see the car kind of moving along.
[01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:54.920]   So, what's going on for people listening?
[01:16:54.920 --> 01:16:56.520]   Boy, somebody needs a life.
[01:16:56.520 --> 01:16:57.520]   Yeah, seriously.
[01:16:57.520 --> 01:17:02.400]   Each tweet is an ASCII representation of a car going down a street.
[01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:06.000]   And if you jade down the page really quickly, you can see the same animation as those horses.
[01:17:06.000 --> 01:17:07.000]   Oh, there's a person.
[01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:08.000]   There's a couple.
[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:09.000]   That's pretty funny.
[01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:10.000]   It's pretty neat.
[01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:11.000]   It's pretty neat.
[01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:12.000]   Sorry, I'm just asking for...
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:13.000]   You know what?
[01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:14.000]   It's an advertisement for...
[01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:15.000]   Guess what?
[01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:16.000]   The Smart Car.
[01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:17.000]   The Smart Car, yeah.
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:18.000]   From Argentina.
[01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:19.000]   It's already given them free advertising, but that's a really...
[01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:20.000]   I don't mind.
[01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:21.760]   I'm used to Twitter and, uh, it just reminded me because of the horse animation.
[01:17:21.760 --> 01:17:25.760]   Has anybody else done, um, animations with their tweets?
[01:17:25.760 --> 01:17:28.960]   You know, if you follow these guys, you'd be very puzzled what the hell is going on
[01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:29.960]   on in my tweets.
[01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:30.960]   Seriously.
[01:17:30.960 --> 01:17:33.560]   Oh, yeah, it's completely, you know, impractical.
[01:17:33.560 --> 01:17:34.560]   Right.
[01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:37.760]   Maybe if you have a fan of way to monetize Twitter.
[01:17:37.760 --> 01:17:39.760]   Asky animation.
[01:17:39.760 --> 01:17:40.760]   Asky animation.
[01:17:40.760 --> 01:17:42.960]   It's the future of Twitter.
[01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:44.360]   It's the future of Twitter.
[01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:45.960]   You know, they only have 34...
[01:17:45.960 --> 01:17:47.560]   No, they have a thousand followers.
[01:17:47.560 --> 01:17:50.800]   They don't have a lot of followers because you really wouldn't want to follow this.
[01:17:50.800 --> 01:17:51.800]   No.
[01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:52.800]   It's true.
[01:17:52.800 --> 01:17:55.800]   I set it up so your phone rings each time they post something.
[01:17:55.800 --> 01:17:58.200]   Oh, no, another one.
[01:17:58.200 --> 01:18:00.680]   There are a bunch of dots and lines.
[01:18:00.680 --> 01:18:03.880]   I think there are some interesting uses of Twitter out there.
[01:18:03.880 --> 01:18:08.720]   I'm starting to see some clever work around kind of stuff going on with Twitter.
[01:18:08.720 --> 01:18:09.720]   Somebody sent me a link.
[01:18:09.720 --> 01:18:11.280]   I'll have to find it.
[01:18:11.280 --> 01:18:12.600]   Uh, let's see.
[01:18:12.600 --> 01:18:14.080]   What else is big in the news?
[01:18:14.080 --> 01:18:16.240]   Uh, I guess we have to do some dull stuff.
[01:18:16.240 --> 01:18:20.000]   Just going to do it and, you know, try to live with it.
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:25.000]   Microsoft buying AOL's patents for $1.1 billion.
[01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.240]   Should that have been a bigger story than Instagram?
[01:18:27.240 --> 01:18:28.240]   I don't know.
[01:18:28.240 --> 01:18:30.120]   Sure got, uh, uh, a big deal.
[01:18:30.120 --> 01:18:31.120]   Very good on the Instagram.
[01:18:31.120 --> 01:18:32.120]   Yeah.
[01:18:32.120 --> 01:18:34.480]   The Instagram news just killed that.
[01:18:34.480 --> 01:18:37.120]   So it's 800 patents.
[01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:39.920]   This really, I think this is really, is this the end of AOL?
[01:18:39.920 --> 01:18:42.120]   Why are they selling these patents?
[01:18:42.120 --> 01:18:44.520]   Oh, it's a great deal for AOL.
[01:18:44.520 --> 01:18:45.680]   I'm not sure.
[01:18:45.680 --> 01:18:46.760]   So sure about Microsoft.
[01:18:46.760 --> 01:18:48.360]   Many of these are expiring soon.
[01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:50.960]   Oh, many of these are from the Netscape.
[01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:51.960]   Yeah.
[01:18:51.960 --> 01:18:52.960]   Many of these are Netscape patents.
[01:18:52.960 --> 01:18:57.200]   Well, in fact, that's kind of a funny thing because they're, they're, um, in the statement
[01:18:57.200 --> 01:18:59.320]   there's like, and we're selling a little bit of other stuff.
[01:18:59.320 --> 01:19:00.320]   One of the things was Netscape.
[01:19:00.320 --> 01:19:01.320]   Yeah.
[01:19:01.320 --> 01:19:04.520]   They hold onto the brand, not that it's worth anything.
[01:19:04.520 --> 01:19:08.400]   Hey, remember AOL bought Netscape.
[01:19:08.400 --> 01:19:13.880]   And now they're selling it to Microsoft, which Netscape basically killed it in.
[01:19:13.880 --> 01:19:17.040]   It's a very, maybe 10 years from now, we'll laugh about how, uh,
[01:19:17.040 --> 01:19:18.040]   Kill Netscape.
[01:19:18.040 --> 01:19:25.640]   Facebook in trouble, uh, sells, um, uh, Instagram and what's left of its assets, uh, to Twitter.
[01:19:25.640 --> 01:19:26.640]   Pro-cash injection.
[01:19:26.640 --> 01:19:27.640]   Yeah.
[01:19:27.640 --> 01:19:28.640]   That's Twitter.
[01:19:28.640 --> 01:19:31.360]   They retain the right to use all these, uh, patents.
[01:19:31.360 --> 01:19:34.560]   So forever, which was kind of a good deal for them.
[01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:36.360]   And so there was something interesting going on here.
[01:19:36.360 --> 01:19:39.760]   Like, so Microsoft has owns part of Facebook.
[01:19:39.760 --> 01:19:42.240]   And so now AOL can't sue Facebook.
[01:19:42.240 --> 01:19:44.640]   I think that was what this was really all about.
[01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:47.520]   I bet you Mark Zuckerberg wrote a check for some of this.
[01:19:47.520 --> 01:19:48.520]   That's what I.
[01:19:48.520 --> 01:19:49.520]   Oh, really?
[01:19:49.520 --> 01:19:50.520]   Yeah.
[01:19:50.520 --> 01:19:53.440]   Because some of these patents were you being used against Facebook and the Yahoo Facebook
[01:19:53.440 --> 01:19:58.120]   lawsuit or it could just be a defense portfolio, right?
[01:19:58.120 --> 01:20:03.560]   Um, and since it's, there is this nexus between Microsoft and Facebook.
[01:20:03.560 --> 01:20:04.560]   I think that's very interesting.
[01:20:04.560 --> 01:20:05.560]   That is interesting.
[01:20:05.560 --> 01:20:11.800]   I'm telling you, I think it was up there about maps and that, and that a lot of the patents
[01:20:11.800 --> 01:20:14.520]   are around maps and is made go after Google on maps.
[01:20:14.520 --> 01:20:15.720]   So I'm not sure I agree with that.
[01:20:15.720 --> 01:20:17.520]   I'm not sure that's a great battleground.
[01:20:17.520 --> 01:20:21.000]   So you always want to, you know, kind of there's two ways you could use patents offensively
[01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:22.000]   and defensively.
[01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:26.760]   Are these defensive or are these, or is Microsoft going to go on the offensive?
[01:20:26.760 --> 01:20:30.480]   Speaking of the institutions that we build when we go and we deserve God, the patent
[01:20:30.480 --> 01:20:32.040]   institution is just such a mess.
[01:20:32.040 --> 01:20:35.320]   I always say it every time we bring it up, but this is just an example of an absolute
[01:20:35.320 --> 01:20:37.080]   waste of capital.
[01:20:37.080 --> 01:20:38.080]   Yep.
[01:20:38.080 --> 01:20:47.680]   Uh, Netscape, I CQ and map quest also compu-serve advertising dot com.
[01:20:47.680 --> 01:20:49.840]   These are some pretty, pretty old ones.
[01:20:49.840 --> 01:20:51.960]   Um, 714351134.
[01:20:51.960 --> 01:20:54.720]   That's 75106, 3139.
[01:20:54.720 --> 01:21:05.440]   What Jeff and I are saying, you know what we're talking about, Gina?
[01:21:05.440 --> 01:21:07.120]   Your compu-serve handle.
[01:21:07.120 --> 01:21:08.120]   Very good.
[01:21:08.120 --> 01:21:09.120]   Okay.
[01:21:09.120 --> 01:21:10.120]   All right.
[01:21:10.120 --> 01:21:11.120]   Yes.
[01:21:11.120 --> 01:21:13.520]   She was like four when compu-serve sold AOL.
[01:21:13.520 --> 01:21:14.280]   Yeah.
[01:21:14.280 --> 01:21:19.200]   There is a termination fee if it doesn't go through of $211 million.
[01:21:19.200 --> 01:21:21.120]   So I, well, that's the Bonanza.
[01:21:21.120 --> 01:21:22.120]   Very well.
[01:21:22.120 --> 01:21:23.120]   You're doing good.
[01:21:23.120 --> 01:21:32.840]   Um, AOL is going to use some of the money, uh, to offset income taxes.
[01:21:32.840 --> 01:21:39.480]   The deal expected to be completed by the end of 2012 includes the sale of an AOL unit.
[01:21:39.480 --> 01:21:40.480]   Netscape.
[01:21:40.480 --> 01:21:41.480]   I just love that.
[01:21:41.480 --> 01:21:44.720]   And that's, that's, that's, that's the story for taxes.
[01:21:44.720 --> 01:21:45.720]   Yeah.
[01:21:45.720 --> 01:21:47.120]   Gotta get rid of that Netscape thing.
[01:21:47.120 --> 01:21:52.120]   By the way, did you see that now, uh, the latest to dump Google Maps, Wikipedia?
[01:21:52.120 --> 01:21:53.120]   Yeah.
[01:21:53.120 --> 01:21:54.960]   Four squared did it?
[01:21:54.960 --> 01:21:57.640]   I think Google Maps was foolish to start charging for.
[01:21:57.640 --> 01:21:58.640]   I think you were right.
[01:21:58.640 --> 01:22:01.040]   It's, it's, it's de minimis revenue and it's going to affect their branding.
[01:22:01.040 --> 01:22:02.640]   It's going to affect their use data.
[01:22:02.640 --> 01:22:05.400]   Uh, I think that was a bad move.
[01:22:05.400 --> 01:22:08.160]   Jeff, although I, I don't think there's going to be a lot more of this.
[01:22:08.160 --> 01:22:13.440]   I think each of the defectors has, uh, its own reason that are, is different from the
[01:22:13.440 --> 01:22:15.000]   other reasons.
[01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:21.600]   For example, uh, an open wiki-based mapping service makes infinite sense for Wikipedia.
[01:22:21.600 --> 01:22:24.200]   Uh, and Google Maps probably never made sense for them.
[01:22:24.200 --> 01:22:25.440]   Yeah, I was kind of surprised.
[01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:27.400]   I mean, why did they do this before?
[01:22:27.400 --> 01:22:30.840]   And Apple, uh, who, who got rid of a, iOS, uh, what was it?
[01:22:30.840 --> 01:22:32.680]   I photo for iOS.
[01:22:32.680 --> 01:22:35.320]   Uh, that's part of the thermonuclear war.
[01:22:35.320 --> 01:22:40.200]   I think Apple's going to be dropping Google products left and right just as, you know,
[01:22:40.200 --> 01:22:43.920]   sort of payback for Android indefinitely as soon as they can get rid of stuff, they
[01:22:43.920 --> 01:22:45.120]   can get rid of it.
[01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:50.720]   Um, I don't see any connection between the two and I don't see a lot of, um, a lot of
[01:22:50.720 --> 01:22:52.520]   others lining up to, to get rid of it.
[01:22:52.520 --> 01:22:53.760]   I mean, I could be wrong about that.
[01:22:53.760 --> 01:22:59.640]   Plus, I think that Google very well could, um, you know, ultimately beat, um, beat them
[01:22:59.640 --> 01:23:04.080]   at their own game and kind of open it up and, and, and bring a lot more contributions in.
[01:23:04.080 --> 01:23:06.080]   And you know, I can see them doing that as well.
[01:23:06.080 --> 01:23:09.600]   So I don't think it's a crisis for Google Maps.
[01:23:09.600 --> 01:23:14.160]   The only thing more exciting than talking about patents is talking about lawsuits.
[01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:15.360]   And we're going to do that too.
[01:23:15.360 --> 01:23:19.920]   Uh, well, this is a big story and I'm sure Tianti will be talking a lot about it, uh,
[01:23:19.920 --> 01:23:25.600]   as well as our law show, this law, twill, uh, Denise Howell, Justice, that's coming
[01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:26.600]   Friday by the way.
[01:23:26.600 --> 01:23:27.600]   What time is twill on Friday?
[01:23:27.600 --> 01:23:28.600]   11,000.
[01:23:28.600 --> 01:23:29.600]   11 Pacific.
[01:23:29.600 --> 01:23:34.680]   So tune in a couple of days and I'm sure Denise and her team of crack lawyers will
[01:23:34.680 --> 01:23:35.840]   talk about this.
[01:23:35.840 --> 01:23:39.520]   It may not be, it may be over by the time they start talking about the justice department
[01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:46.120]   has filed suit against Apple and a number of publishers over colluding over ebook prices.
[01:23:46.120 --> 01:23:52.680]   According to this story by CNET, um, actually Bloomberg's reporting that, uh, most of these
[01:23:52.680 --> 01:23:54.680]   publishers are looking to settle today.
[01:23:54.680 --> 01:23:56.920]   They're going, okay, you got us.
[01:23:56.920 --> 01:23:58.160]   What do you want?
[01:23:58.160 --> 01:24:02.920]   Simon and Schuster has shed and news corpse Harper Collins will settle, uh, according
[01:24:02.920 --> 01:24:05.280]   to Bloomberg as soon as today.
[01:24:05.280 --> 01:24:07.960]   Apple and Macmillan are not engaged in settlement talks.
[01:24:07.960 --> 01:24:08.960]   They're going to fight it.
[01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:12.800]   They've denied wrongdoing and they're going to argue their agreement actually improved
[01:24:12.800 --> 01:24:14.040]   the competitive environment.
[01:24:14.040 --> 01:24:17.200]   Yeah, and this is one that's, that's not simple.
[01:24:17.200 --> 01:24:18.200]   It's complicated.
[01:24:18.200 --> 01:24:19.520]   Wildy has written good stuff about it.
[01:24:19.520 --> 01:24:24.120]   The part of the argument, I believe and I've not followed this closely enough is that,
[01:24:24.120 --> 01:24:28.480]   um, this was an effort to actually get more money into content creators pockets and we're
[01:24:28.480 --> 01:24:29.960]   so bad about that.
[01:24:29.960 --> 01:24:35.080]   Um, you know, one wonders why Apple's on the, on the horn here, not, uh, Amazon.
[01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:36.400]   It's, it's, well, that's what Apple's saying.
[01:24:36.400 --> 01:24:38.120]   Hey, we're just trying to compete with Amazon.
[01:24:38.120 --> 01:24:40.520]   We're trying to provide a competitive environment story.
[01:24:40.520 --> 01:24:41.760]   It's tough.
[01:24:41.760 --> 01:24:49.320]   This is something that, um, that I wonder about because if you do what Amazon does domestically
[01:24:49.320 --> 01:24:53.800]   and you do it internationally, it's called price dumping where, so for example, if Samsung
[01:24:53.800 --> 01:24:58.080]   sells something in the United States for less than it costs them to make it and less than
[01:24:58.080 --> 01:25:02.200]   they sell it in Korea, that is an international trade problem.
[01:25:02.200 --> 01:25:03.200]   Right.
[01:25:03.200 --> 01:25:05.200]   And but if you do it domestically, it's legal.
[01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:11.040]   So what Amazon often does, they have a thing called the, uh, the wholesale model, uh, where,
[01:25:11.040 --> 01:25:16.320]   where Amazon negotiates a price for content from the publishers, then they sell it at
[01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:20.480]   whatever price they want, which is oftentimes in the case of electronic books lower than
[01:25:20.480 --> 01:25:21.400]   what they paid for it.
[01:25:21.400 --> 01:25:23.840]   They lose money on that ebook.
[01:25:23.840 --> 01:25:28.960]   Uh, and, and, and so the, and that's okay to, for them to do that.
[01:25:28.960 --> 01:25:32.880]   Then Apple comes along and says, okay, well, we're going to let the publisher set the price.
[01:25:32.880 --> 01:25:37.800]   We'll sell it at any price the publisher wants to sell it, but we get our cut, but you, they
[01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:43.560]   can't go to another, you know, they can't go to Amazon and sell, also use their model.
[01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:49.080]   So you have to pick either the agency model or the wholesale model, take your pick.
[01:25:49.080 --> 01:25:53.440]   That was Apple's collusion that the just department sued them over.
[01:25:53.440 --> 01:25:58.640]   And that is freaking out the publishing industry because people kind of thought Apple's model,
[01:25:58.640 --> 01:26:03.560]   not Apple per se, but the Apple model of agent, the agency model could save publishing because
[01:26:03.560 --> 01:26:09.080]   it allows publishers to set the price, allows publishers to pay editors and all that stuff.
[01:26:09.080 --> 01:26:13.720]   So it's, it should, this should be way more controversial than it is.
[01:26:13.720 --> 01:26:16.600]   And I'm not saying that they should crack down on Amazon and I'm not saying that they
[01:26:16.600 --> 01:26:22.240]   should or shouldn't crack down on Apple, but Apple came up with an idea for how the publishing
[01:26:22.240 --> 01:26:27.160]   industry could continue to pay editors, continue to pay writers and all that kind of stuff.
[01:26:27.160 --> 01:26:30.000]   Without that model, we don't have an option.
[01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:35.680]   We're looking at a future where professionals don't make any money, make making books.
[01:26:35.680 --> 01:26:36.680]   Wow.
[01:26:36.680 --> 01:26:38.120]   Hey, I'm glad you talk.
[01:26:38.120 --> 01:26:39.120]   Are you explain that?
[01:26:39.120 --> 01:26:40.120]   Yes, thank you.
[01:26:40.120 --> 01:26:44.200]   Yeah, I'm glad to because my comments about the story was I don't get it.
[01:26:44.200 --> 01:26:45.200]   I don't know.
[01:26:45.200 --> 01:26:47.200]   Whatever Mike says.
[01:26:47.200 --> 01:26:49.200]   Yeah, he's right.
[01:26:49.200 --> 01:26:50.920]   He said we're going to take a break.
[01:26:50.920 --> 01:26:51.920]   We'll come back.
[01:26:51.920 --> 01:26:55.080]   We've got tips, picks and more in just a bit.
[01:26:55.080 --> 01:27:00.640]   Gina Trepani, Jeff Jarvis, Mike Elgin, and of course our friends at carbonite.com.
[01:27:00.640 --> 01:27:01.600]   Back up, done right.
[01:27:01.600 --> 01:27:04.480]   If you're not backing up, you ought to be, you know this.
[01:27:04.480 --> 01:27:06.160]   I don't have to tell you this.
[01:27:06.160 --> 01:27:09.880]   I might question your strategy if you're just backing up to a hard drive right next to your
[01:27:09.880 --> 01:27:10.880]   computer.
[01:27:10.880 --> 01:27:11.880]   That's good.
[01:27:11.880 --> 01:27:12.880]   I'm not saying don't do it.
[01:27:12.880 --> 01:27:13.880]   I do it.
[01:27:13.880 --> 01:27:14.880]   I use time machine on the Mac.
[01:27:14.880 --> 01:27:15.880]   It's great.
[01:27:15.880 --> 01:27:16.880]   I use a sync program on Windows.
[01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:17.880]   Great.
[01:27:17.880 --> 01:27:19.200]   But what happens if there's a fire flood?
[01:27:19.200 --> 01:27:20.680]   Somebody breaks in, steals all your stuff.
[01:27:20.680 --> 01:27:22.760]   You got to have disaster.
[01:27:22.760 --> 01:27:25.040]   You got to have kind of a disaster mentality.
[01:27:25.040 --> 01:27:26.040]   That's a disaster protection.
[01:27:26.040 --> 01:27:28.200]   That's where carbonite is the way to go.
[01:27:28.200 --> 01:27:30.400]   Carbonite is back up done right.
[01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:33.080]   Carbonite.com, C-A-R-B-O-N-I-T-E.
[01:27:33.080 --> 01:27:36.720]   It's three things that every backup has to have.
[01:27:36.720 --> 01:27:38.680]   Automatic, so you don't have to remember.
[01:27:38.680 --> 01:27:43.000]   Continuous, so every change to every document gets backed up instantly.
[01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.720]   And finally, off-site, it's backing up to the Internet.
[01:27:45.720 --> 01:27:50.400]   By the way, you control the encryption keys if you want to encrypt, so your privacy is
[01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:51.560]   100% protected.
[01:27:51.560 --> 01:27:53.480]   It uses SSL.
[01:27:53.480 --> 01:27:57.880]   So whenever you're online, even in an open access spot, you're safely, conveniently and
[01:27:57.880 --> 01:28:01.360]   privately, syncing your data.
[01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:04.840]   This is really great for laptops, because for 59 bucks, you can back up everything on
[01:28:04.840 --> 01:28:05.840]   that laptop.
[01:28:05.840 --> 01:28:09.040]   If you have external drives or multiple computers, they have plans for that too.
[01:28:09.040 --> 01:28:10.720]   Go to carbonite.com.
[01:28:10.720 --> 01:28:11.760]   Use our offer code TWIG.

[01:28:33.480 --> 01:28:35.960]   For less than five bucks a month, it's a no-brainer.
[01:28:35.960 --> 01:28:39.800]   If you don't have a disaster plan, you need carbonite.
[01:28:39.800 --> 01:28:41.480]   Use the offer code TWIG.
[01:28:41.480 --> 01:28:47.760]   I'll just run through a couple of other stories and see if there's anything that anybody wants
[01:28:47.760 --> 01:28:48.760]   to talk about.
[01:28:48.760 --> 01:28:51.920]   The Google Power of the Internet campaign.
[01:28:51.920 --> 01:28:52.920]   I got an email.
[01:28:52.920 --> 01:28:56.160]   I personally got an email from Vince Surf.
[01:28:56.160 --> 01:28:58.160]   Did you?
[01:28:58.160 --> 01:28:59.160]   Sure.
[01:28:59.160 --> 01:29:00.160]   You signed up for the...
[01:29:00.160 --> 01:29:01.160]   Yeah, you must go to the petition.
[01:29:01.160 --> 01:29:02.960]   We all got that interview, right?
[01:29:02.960 --> 01:29:10.200]   Mika Sifri from Personal Democracy Forum was trying to ask questions about basically lobbying
[01:29:10.200 --> 01:29:14.000]   Google about how they could use that email list of people who signed up for the Zova
[01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:18.040]   petition to start something ongoing.
[01:29:18.040 --> 01:29:22.680]   So those of us who signed up or signed the Zova petition got an email from the father
[01:29:22.680 --> 01:29:28.880]   of the Internet, Vince Surf saying, "Hey, we beat Zova, but let's not stop now.
[01:29:28.880 --> 01:29:29.960]   Let's start a conversation.
[01:29:29.960 --> 01:29:32.600]   What does the Internet do for you?"
[01:29:32.600 --> 01:29:36.920]   And interestingly, and I like this, they're using not just Google+, but Facebook and Twitter
[01:29:36.920 --> 01:29:37.920]   for this.
[01:29:37.920 --> 01:29:39.360]   Yeah, I like that too.
[01:29:39.360 --> 01:29:40.360]   Yeah.
[01:29:40.360 --> 01:29:41.360]   Inclusiveness.
[01:29:41.360 --> 01:29:43.120]   So Gina, complete the sentence.
[01:29:43.120 --> 01:29:45.920]   The Internet is the Power 2 blank.
[01:29:45.920 --> 01:29:49.200]   Have you done it yet?
[01:29:49.200 --> 01:29:52.040]   I wrote a book about that.
[01:29:52.040 --> 01:29:53.040]   Read my book.
[01:29:53.040 --> 01:29:54.560]   I'm reading the ones going by.
[01:29:54.560 --> 01:29:55.560]   It's amazing.
[01:29:55.560 --> 01:29:56.560]   It's pretty neat.
[01:29:56.560 --> 01:29:58.560]   Dream, collaborate and create.
[01:29:58.560 --> 01:30:00.200]   Engage it.
[01:30:00.200 --> 01:30:01.520]   This is from a church.
[01:30:01.520 --> 01:30:02.520]   Engage our congregation.
[01:30:02.520 --> 01:30:03.520]   Yeah.
[01:30:03.520 --> 01:30:04.520]   It's okay.
[01:30:04.520 --> 01:30:06.000]   Do business on the consumers' terms.
[01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:07.000]   I like that.
[01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:08.720]   Breathe life into a new business.
[01:30:08.720 --> 01:30:13.240]   I mean, for me, it's reached thousands of amazing Twig fans that listen to us every week
[01:30:13.240 --> 01:30:14.440]   and watch live.
[01:30:14.440 --> 01:30:17.480]   I mean, this is the show itself is such a privilege.
[01:30:17.480 --> 01:30:18.480]   Yep.
[01:30:18.480 --> 01:30:19.480]   It's huge for me.
[01:30:19.480 --> 01:30:26.400]   I mean, the Internet gives me the chance to do what I love without having to be at the,
[01:30:26.400 --> 01:30:29.520]   you know, beholden to big corporations who control media.
[01:30:29.520 --> 01:30:33.480]   The Internet allows the power to make a living from Santorini.
[01:30:33.480 --> 01:30:36.040]   The power to make a living from Santorini.
[01:30:36.040 --> 01:30:39.960]   I haven't figured that out yet, but that's a good idea.
[01:30:39.960 --> 01:30:41.560]   What's all you got?
[01:30:41.560 --> 01:30:42.560]   I have a good idea.
[01:30:42.560 --> 01:30:46.760]   If I had good Skype connections to Santorini, I'd be there.
[01:30:46.760 --> 01:30:48.280]   We need to get more Internet.
[01:30:48.280 --> 01:30:52.280]   Anyway, look for an email from a Vint Cerf.
[01:30:52.280 --> 01:30:56.440]   And even if you didn't get the email from Vint Cerf, I think it was just kind of cool.
[01:30:56.440 --> 01:30:59.000]   I have to say it was a little bit of a surprise when I got it.
[01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:03.800]   I thought, wow, the father of the Internet writing to me and then I realized, oh, this
[01:31:03.800 --> 01:31:06.360]   is, it's junk mail, but it's not junk mail.
[01:31:06.360 --> 01:31:08.720]   You even said my name, Leo.
[01:31:08.720 --> 01:31:11.760]   Earlier this year, you did something amazing.
[01:31:11.760 --> 01:31:12.760]   What a great way.
[01:31:12.760 --> 01:31:14.720]   That's a good lead.
[01:31:14.720 --> 01:31:15.720]   You spoke.
[01:31:15.720 --> 01:31:16.720]   The Google bot loves you, Leo.
[01:31:16.720 --> 01:31:17.720]   The Google bot loves me.
[01:31:17.720 --> 01:31:19.800]   See, I've all is forgiven.
[01:31:19.800 --> 01:31:21.920]   All is forgiven.
[01:31:21.920 --> 01:31:27.080]   So Google.com/takeaction/start-something.
[01:31:27.080 --> 01:31:30.400]   So this is Google take action like going to be there.
[01:31:30.400 --> 01:31:31.880]   Yeah, see, it doesn't.
[01:31:31.880 --> 01:31:33.680]   Yeah, it gets to be something bigger.
[01:31:33.680 --> 01:31:36.320]   I think it's right for them to start off in the general.
[01:31:36.320 --> 01:31:37.320]   It's starting.
[01:31:37.320 --> 01:31:41.160]   But Google should be, Google and Facebook and Twitter should be defending the Internet.
[01:31:41.160 --> 01:31:42.760]   I keep on coming back to it.
[01:31:42.760 --> 01:31:43.760]   Great.
[01:31:43.760 --> 01:31:45.120]   There's all these efforts to control the Internet.
[01:31:45.120 --> 01:31:47.200]   It's frightening institutions.
[01:31:47.200 --> 01:31:48.680]   Institutions are being disrupted.
[01:31:48.680 --> 01:31:52.280]   I can launch into that again, geeks.
[01:31:52.280 --> 01:31:55.800]   And they're not defending the net enough.
[01:31:55.800 --> 01:31:56.800]   Neither are we all.
[01:31:56.800 --> 01:31:57.800]   Well, this is a start.
[01:31:57.800 --> 01:31:58.800]   It's a start.
[01:31:58.800 --> 01:32:01.440]   And I want a lot more of it.
[01:32:01.440 --> 01:32:02.440]   I want to see more.
[01:32:02.440 --> 01:32:03.440]   You're right.
[01:32:03.440 --> 01:32:04.440]   Okay, good.
[01:32:04.440 --> 01:32:07.440]   We got some good discussion out of that.
[01:32:07.440 --> 01:32:09.800]   Let me see what else I just want to make sure we don't miss anything.
[01:32:09.800 --> 01:32:14.120]   Did you see that they're going to now add windows to Chrome books to Chrome OS?
[01:32:14.120 --> 01:32:16.600]   That was very strange.
[01:32:16.600 --> 01:32:19.200]   Yeah, I don't get that.
[01:32:19.200 --> 01:32:22.840]   Yeah, it is kind of like what's going on with Chrome OS.
[01:32:22.840 --> 01:32:27.160]   It's not requiring full screen anymore.
[01:32:27.160 --> 01:32:30.560]   Google Chrome Beta 9 brings live tab syncing.
[01:32:30.560 --> 01:32:31.560]   What?
[01:32:31.560 --> 01:32:33.600]   Like that.
[01:32:33.600 --> 01:32:38.440]   So if you have a bunch, I guess, you know, I'm not a big tab guy.
[01:32:38.440 --> 01:32:42.600]   I mean, I have a few open right now, but most geeks have hundreds of tabs.
[01:32:42.600 --> 01:32:43.600]   Yes.
[01:32:43.600 --> 01:32:44.600]   Yeah.
[01:32:44.600 --> 01:32:45.600]   Why?
[01:32:45.600 --> 01:32:47.600]   What's wrong with you people?
[01:32:47.600 --> 01:32:49.120]   Lack of attention span for me.
[01:32:49.120 --> 01:32:50.280]   Is it a form of hoarding?
[01:32:50.280 --> 01:32:51.920]   Like, well, I don't want to close this window.
[01:32:51.920 --> 01:32:52.920]   I might need it someday.
[01:32:52.920 --> 01:32:58.600]   Yeah, I want to do a thing with that page and I just haven't gotten to it yet.
[01:32:58.600 --> 01:33:00.160]   How many tabs do you have open right now, Gina?
[01:33:00.160 --> 01:33:01.160]   Do you know?
[01:33:01.160 --> 01:33:06.040]   I mean, enough that I'm only seeing like one letter plus the fav icon.
[01:33:06.040 --> 01:33:07.040]   Yeah.
[01:33:07.040 --> 01:33:08.040]   But you know, we're doing the show.
[01:33:08.040 --> 01:33:11.240]   I basically have all the stories open, you know, that were working on.
[01:33:11.240 --> 01:33:12.240]   22 for me.
[01:33:12.240 --> 01:33:13.240]   22.
[01:33:13.240 --> 01:33:20.600]   I have a Chrome extension that lets me select an infinite number of links and then click
[01:33:20.600 --> 01:33:23.480]   a single button to open all of them and tabs.
[01:33:23.480 --> 01:33:25.240]   And I use it constantly.
[01:33:25.240 --> 01:33:31.400]   So I usually have, you know, anywhere between 30 and 60 or so going.
[01:33:31.400 --> 01:33:34.840]   I can see bloggers, somebody like you, because you're doing a lot of research.
[01:33:34.840 --> 01:33:35.840]   Yeah.
[01:33:35.840 --> 01:33:41.520]   When Chrome crashes and it can't restore my tab, it's just like send lesson and that like
[01:33:41.520 --> 01:33:44.640]   I own nothing, you know, it's like it's all just on every time.
[01:33:44.640 --> 01:33:51.240]   And even I lose my pin tabs, you know, I work hard to have my half dozen pin tabs and they're
[01:33:51.240 --> 01:33:52.240]   gone.
[01:33:52.240 --> 01:33:53.840]   Yeah, the pin tabs too.
[01:33:53.840 --> 01:33:57.280]   That's like it's like my house is in the setup of the pin tabs aren't aren't there.
[01:33:57.280 --> 01:33:59.400]   Chrome is a great product.
[01:33:59.400 --> 01:34:03.560]   YouTube, YouTube live now adds pay per view, which is very interesting.
[01:34:03.560 --> 01:34:07.320]   You can now monetize your live events with advertising or paid options.
[01:34:07.320 --> 01:34:11.680]   A live event can be claimed in a new video manager, just like any video and monetized
[01:34:11.680 --> 01:34:14.680]   with in stream ads or paid options.
[01:34:14.680 --> 01:34:19.360]   And you don't see that working for mass things, but I can imagine it working for kind of B2B
[01:34:19.360 --> 01:34:20.360]   things.
[01:34:20.360 --> 01:34:25.000]   They've been using it for UFC, which is does a lot of pay per view stuff.
[01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:26.760]   This is off the Google.
[01:34:26.760 --> 01:34:30.360]   Somebody sent me a note saying, Oh, now you can put your own ads into your YouTube live.
[01:34:30.360 --> 01:34:33.400]   I don't know if that really is true or not.
[01:34:33.400 --> 01:34:34.400]   So how does that work though?
[01:34:34.400 --> 01:34:38.720]   Is that is that I don't know, it will let you on YouTube live because you just read your
[01:34:38.720 --> 01:34:39.720]   own ads?
[01:34:39.720 --> 01:34:43.680]   Well, we we we wanted to be part of YouTube live.
[01:34:43.680 --> 01:34:45.520]   I've always wanted to because I would love it.
[01:34:45.520 --> 01:34:50.200]   We have we have three live for five, actually more for five live streaming partners, you
[01:34:50.200 --> 01:34:54.840]   know, big gravity, you stream Justin.TV.
[01:34:54.840 --> 01:34:59.240]   And I would like more more ways to get us a bit torrent live.
[01:34:59.240 --> 01:35:04.080]   And so we as soon as YouTube live came out, you know, every you know, they put Jason Calicanis
[01:35:04.080 --> 01:35:05.080]   is this week on.
[01:35:05.080 --> 01:35:07.160]   So I thought Cali's on a Cali look.
[01:35:07.160 --> 01:35:08.560]   So they're, Oh, we should.
[01:35:08.560 --> 01:35:14.680]   So we we call them a sales rep called us who didn't know who us from Adam.
[01:35:14.680 --> 01:35:19.560]   And I asked, he said, Well, you know, you can't have ads.
[01:35:19.560 --> 01:35:20.840]   So I don't understand.
[01:35:20.840 --> 01:35:23.320]   So revision three has one ad.
[01:35:23.320 --> 01:35:25.360]   So they may be the made a side deal.
[01:35:25.360 --> 01:35:27.840]   Anyway, I don't think this means we can have our own ads.
[01:35:27.840 --> 01:35:31.720]   So we can't be part of YouTube live, which is too bad because I I really would like to
[01:35:31.720 --> 01:35:37.120]   be but they ever give you any hassle about having ads and and just recorded videos.
[01:35:37.120 --> 01:35:38.800]   You mean like on YouTube?
[01:35:38.800 --> 01:35:39.800]   Yeah.
[01:35:39.800 --> 01:35:41.200]   Oh, that's not an issue there at all.
[01:35:41.200 --> 01:35:42.720]   I don't think so.
[01:35:42.720 --> 01:35:46.240]   Well, should it don't bring it up.
[01:35:46.240 --> 01:35:47.240]   I'm sorry.
[01:35:47.240 --> 01:35:48.240]   I wouldn't ask.
[01:35:48.240 --> 01:35:49.240]   Yeah, don't ask.
[01:35:49.240 --> 01:35:50.240]   Really?
[01:35:50.240 --> 01:35:54.440]   I didn't hear that.
[01:35:54.440 --> 01:35:58.640]   Will there be a dot YouTube or a dot Google Google confirmed on Tuesday?
[01:35:58.640 --> 01:36:00.240]   It will apply for a generic TLD.
[01:36:00.240 --> 01:36:04.600]   Remember the I can said now if you have a hundred million dollars or whatever it is,
[01:36:04.600 --> 01:36:10.000]   you can get your own trademark TLD Google has applied for the use of Google's trademark
[01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:11.000]   TLDs.
[01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:16.240]   They they didn't that those applications closed on April 12th Google didn't say exactly which
[01:36:16.240 --> 01:36:19.440]   TLDs it applied for, but you got to figure.
[01:36:19.440 --> 01:36:20.440]   I don't know.
[01:36:20.440 --> 01:36:21.440]   Maybe they'll be dot geo.
[01:36:21.440 --> 01:36:22.440]   Is there a dot geo?
[01:36:22.440 --> 01:36:23.440]   Let me go.
[01:36:23.440 --> 01:36:24.440]   That'd be good.
[01:36:24.440 --> 01:36:26.640]   YouTube dot YouTube seems long.
[01:36:26.640 --> 01:36:32.240]   ABC still owns it and go.com.
[01:36:32.240 --> 01:36:35.200]   Could you just have a plus sign?
[01:36:35.200 --> 01:36:37.120]   Could it be done plus sign?
[01:36:37.120 --> 01:36:38.120]   Wouldn't that be cool?
[01:36:38.120 --> 01:36:39.880]   No, I don't think it doesn't sound right.
[01:36:39.880 --> 01:36:43.840]   I don't think it's a valid character in the top top level domain, right?
[01:36:43.840 --> 01:36:48.040]   No, I think they added Unicode in the top level domains.
[01:36:48.040 --> 01:36:49.040]   Oh, you might.
[01:36:49.040 --> 01:36:50.040]   You might be right.
[01:36:50.040 --> 01:36:51.880]   Oh, well, it's a point.
[01:36:51.880 --> 01:36:53.120]   I mean, amazing.
[01:36:53.120 --> 01:37:00.920]   I don't know or dot I guess you could do dot PLUS Facebook did not apply for a top level
[01:37:00.920 --> 01:37:04.680]   domain by the deadline dot Zuck.
[01:37:04.680 --> 01:37:06.520]   That's not.
[01:37:06.520 --> 01:37:07.520]   He's rich.
[01:37:07.520 --> 01:37:10.320]   He could afford to dot Zuck and only he could have it.
[01:37:10.320 --> 01:37:12.680]   That would be so cool, wouldn't it?
[01:37:12.680 --> 01:37:13.680]   Yeah.
[01:37:13.680 --> 01:37:18.480]   All right, let's get our Oh, I guess I should mention this Hillary Clinton likes this is
[01:37:18.480 --> 01:37:19.480]   great.
[01:37:19.480 --> 01:37:20.480]   Love this.
[01:37:20.480 --> 01:37:24.880]   Is it true that she likes it or just Politico says, no, no, no, it's it's no.
[01:37:24.880 --> 01:37:25.880]   She met the guys.
[01:37:25.880 --> 01:37:26.880]   It's great.
[01:37:26.880 --> 01:37:28.720]   She autographed it.
[01:37:28.720 --> 01:37:29.800]   Hills.
[01:37:29.800 --> 01:37:34.720]   So I didn't know this, but there's apparently a tumbler a tumbler a log called text from
[01:37:34.720 --> 01:37:35.720]   Hillary.
[01:37:35.720 --> 01:37:36.720]   I haven't read it.
[01:37:36.720 --> 01:37:37.720]   Is it funny?
[01:37:37.720 --> 01:37:38.720]   It's hilarious.
[01:37:38.720 --> 01:37:41.280]   That picture you just had up of Hill Hillary looking really tough.
[01:37:41.280 --> 01:37:42.280]   Yeah.
[01:37:42.280 --> 01:37:44.320]   And so people just imagine what's on the other end of that text.
[01:37:44.320 --> 01:37:45.320]   Yeah.
[01:37:45.320 --> 01:37:46.320]   Yeah.
[01:37:46.320 --> 01:37:47.320]   What could she have written?
[01:37:47.320 --> 01:37:50.320]   She put a picture.
[01:37:50.320 --> 01:37:51.320]   Okay.
[01:37:51.320 --> 01:37:52.320]   Sup Adam.
[01:37:52.320 --> 01:37:53.320]   Nice selfie.
[01:37:53.320 --> 01:37:54.320]   Stace.
[01:37:54.320 --> 01:37:55.320]   OMG busted.
[01:37:55.320 --> 01:38:01.000]   Sorry, Hills or R O F L your tumbler G2G scrunchie time TT YL.
[01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:02.960]   I don't need it.
[01:38:02.960 --> 01:38:07.920]   So there's there's a vice president Biden with the with the Obama looking over his shoulder
[01:38:07.920 --> 01:38:12.680]   looking at their iPhone president vice president Obama Biden says she's going to love this
[01:38:12.680 --> 01:38:15.560]   new Justin Bieber video.
[01:38:15.560 --> 01:38:18.160]   She takes back back to work boys.
[01:38:18.160 --> 01:38:21.560]   It's such a badass photo.
[01:38:21.560 --> 01:38:22.560]   That's a great photo.
[01:38:22.560 --> 01:38:24.960]   There's so many great.
[01:38:24.960 --> 01:38:25.960]   Yeah.
[01:38:25.960 --> 01:38:27.880]   Huffington Post Hillary.
[01:38:27.880 --> 01:38:31.840]   That's Ariana Hillary post.com.
[01:38:31.840 --> 01:38:35.760]   Guess what I just bought says Mark Zuckerberg walking in front of a blue truck.
[01:38:35.760 --> 01:38:38.360]   A shirt with a big boy collar.
[01:38:38.360 --> 01:38:42.520]   Oh, apparently there are quite a few pictures of Hillary texting.
[01:38:42.520 --> 01:38:44.280]   Oh, it's just that one.
[01:38:44.280 --> 01:38:46.280]   It's the same one that just flip it.
[01:38:46.280 --> 01:38:47.280]   That's different.
[01:38:47.280 --> 01:38:49.480]   Look at these are two different pictures.
[01:38:49.480 --> 01:38:52.280]   She does it a lot.
[01:38:52.280 --> 01:38:54.200]   By all means moving a glacial pace.
[01:38:54.200 --> 01:39:00.040]   You know that thrills me.
[01:39:00.040 --> 01:39:07.120]   Daily show this week texts John Stewart already booked Colbert says Hills.
[01:39:07.120 --> 01:39:08.120]   This is funny.
[01:39:08.120 --> 01:39:09.120]   So she likes it.
[01:39:09.120 --> 01:39:10.120]   Why?
[01:39:10.120 --> 01:39:11.120]   Why wouldn't she?
[01:39:11.120 --> 01:39:12.120]   It's great publicity, right?
[01:39:12.120 --> 01:39:13.120]   Right.
[01:39:13.120 --> 01:39:17.440]   Mark Smith who created the Tumblr account with his friend Stacey Lamb both communications
[01:39:17.440 --> 01:39:22.720]   professionals from Washington DC said after they met with the secretary of state that
[01:39:22.720 --> 01:39:24.240]   he was still in shock.
[01:39:24.240 --> 01:39:26.760]   He got invited to the state department.
[01:39:26.760 --> 01:39:28.560]   That would scare me, right?
[01:39:28.560 --> 01:39:29.560]   Oh, God.
[01:39:29.560 --> 01:39:35.000]   My favorite is Rachel Maddow texted her girls and she wrote back, "Run the world."
[01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.080]   He had the Beyonce reference.
[01:39:37.080 --> 01:39:40.480]   I mean, there's just so much to love about that.
[01:39:40.480 --> 01:39:41.480]   Wow.
[01:39:41.480 --> 01:39:46.680]   I'm still I'm absorbing it.
[01:39:46.680 --> 01:39:47.680]   It was great.
[01:39:47.680 --> 01:39:48.680]   He said she came out.
[01:39:48.680 --> 01:39:49.680]   She was all smiles.
[01:39:49.680 --> 01:39:51.920]   She told us how much she likes to sit in the people have been telling her about it.
[01:39:51.920 --> 01:39:54.640]   She just thinks it's great.
[01:39:54.640 --> 01:40:00.160]   And she even submitted something featuring pictures of the two men with her herself.
[01:40:00.160 --> 01:40:01.520]   That's really great.
[01:40:01.520 --> 01:40:03.600]   And she autographed it.
[01:40:03.600 --> 01:40:05.240]   Thanks for many laws.
[01:40:05.240 --> 01:40:06.240]   Sign Hills.
[01:40:06.240 --> 01:40:07.240]   Good.
[01:40:07.240 --> 01:40:11.160]   You'd like it when the secretary of state has a sense of humor.
[01:40:11.160 --> 01:40:15.040]   More or less likely to go to nuclear war.
[01:40:15.040 --> 01:40:17.960]   Let us get our tip, our number, and our tool of the week.
[01:40:17.960 --> 01:40:22.880]   And if you at any point, Mike Elgin would like to throw down with any of those three
[01:40:22.880 --> 01:40:26.480]   or anything you can think of, just raise your hand and I'll call on you.
[01:40:26.480 --> 01:40:30.760]   But first, it's Gina Trapani and her tip of the week.
[01:40:30.760 --> 01:40:34.080]   A lot of Google junkies like us have more than one Google account.
[01:40:34.080 --> 01:40:38.040]   And we were actually complaining about this a couple of episodes ago that Google supports
[01:40:38.040 --> 01:40:41.360]   multiple sign in, but it doesn't work across all the products.
[01:40:41.360 --> 01:40:42.360]   And it's kind of clunky.
[01:40:42.360 --> 01:40:44.600]   It'll sign you out here and there.
[01:40:44.600 --> 01:40:51.160]   Well, subtle, subtle change, recent change of the Google operating system, excuse me,
[01:40:51.160 --> 01:40:55.360]   blog picked up, that they're making accounts switching a little bit easier.
[01:40:55.360 --> 01:40:59.000]   Now, when you click on the little cog, or I'm sorry, the profile picture in the upper
[01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:03.640]   right hand corner to switch accounts, you'll see your list of Google accounts listed there
[01:41:03.640 --> 01:41:07.240]   and you can choose one before it was, you know, you'd have to click on another link
[01:41:07.240 --> 01:41:08.840]   that said sign into another account.
[01:41:08.840 --> 01:41:10.680]   So they just reduced a click.
[01:41:10.680 --> 01:41:12.760]   So very subtle change, a little bit easier.
[01:41:12.760 --> 01:41:17.880]   The second part of this tip is, you know, we got an email from a very helpful Googler
[01:41:17.880 --> 01:41:20.240]   about our rant about this multi-count sign.
[01:41:20.240 --> 01:41:23.120]   And I think Jeff and I were talking about how much of a pain it is.
[01:41:23.120 --> 01:41:27.160]   And this Google basically said, you know, multi-sign in doesn't work as well as we would
[01:41:27.160 --> 01:41:28.680]   like across all of our products.
[01:41:28.680 --> 01:41:31.400]   It's an internal discussion at Google all the time.
[01:41:31.400 --> 01:41:34.160]   We want to implement this, you know, well and securely.
[01:41:34.160 --> 01:41:38.640]   And an alternative, while it's still rolling out to all our products, is to use Chrome's
[01:41:38.640 --> 01:41:40.800]   user profile switching.
[01:41:40.800 --> 01:41:45.240]   So in Chrome, you can enable multiple user profiles where you sign into one account in
[01:41:45.240 --> 01:41:48.960]   one Chrome window using one profile and you sign into another with another.
[01:41:48.960 --> 01:41:52.600]   It's a little clunky, a little bit of a pain, but that is actually a pretty cool feature
[01:41:52.600 --> 01:41:53.600]   of Chrome.
[01:41:53.600 --> 01:41:57.960]   You also get the benefit of all your tabs and bookmarks and stuff, seeking across those
[01:41:57.960 --> 01:41:58.960]   accounts as well.
[01:41:58.960 --> 01:42:04.800]   So multi-sign in, getting a little bit easier in web pages and a solution of it drives
[01:42:04.800 --> 01:42:05.800]   you crazy.
[01:42:05.800 --> 01:42:07.120]   Like it does us, everyone's for a while.
[01:42:07.120 --> 01:42:11.360]   When I run a right check my Android app sales, Google checkout doesn't handle it well.
[01:42:11.360 --> 01:42:14.320]   You can use multi-profile support in Chrome itself.
[01:42:14.320 --> 01:42:15.320]   That's a good--
[01:42:15.320 --> 01:42:22.440]   Just today, I was on Google+, I erased my curses because I do tend to get a little overboard.
[01:42:22.440 --> 01:42:23.640]   I know that.
[01:42:23.640 --> 01:42:26.280]   Because what happens is it falls out of sync at some point.
[01:42:26.280 --> 01:42:30.920]   So I lost my Chrome, got my Chrome back, and then I would sign into one account and then
[01:42:30.920 --> 01:42:31.920]   try to go to the other one.
[01:42:31.920 --> 01:42:33.080]   So no, you can't, you're in the other account.
[01:42:33.080 --> 01:42:35.560]   So I would sign into that account, then I would sign in the first account.
[01:42:35.560 --> 01:42:38.440]   And then I would go to another window and it would just drive me nuts.
[01:42:38.440 --> 01:42:40.640]   And I literally had to do it a dozen times.
[01:42:40.640 --> 01:42:42.880]   And then suddenly, I got the sequence right.
[01:42:42.880 --> 01:42:46.760]   It's like an old game, you know, push the thing left first and then right, raise your
[01:42:46.760 --> 01:42:48.720]   left foot, and then it lets you do it.
[01:42:48.720 --> 01:42:51.400]   And I cannot figure out what makes it work.
[01:42:51.400 --> 01:42:53.640]   Yeah, it's definitely wonky.
[01:42:53.640 --> 01:43:00.920]   So it might be worth enabling multi-user profiles and you just switch between browser profiles.
[01:43:00.920 --> 01:43:04.120]   Then you got to switch between browser windows.
[01:43:04.120 --> 01:43:05.800]   Right, right.
[01:43:05.800 --> 01:43:07.560]   So you don't get the benefit of tabs.
[01:43:07.560 --> 01:43:09.040]   I have my pinned tabs.
[01:43:09.040 --> 01:43:14.280]   I have my one Gmail account, next to my other Gmail account, next to my Google+, which is
[01:43:14.280 --> 01:43:19.240]   associated with one of them, next to my documents which is associated with the other one.
[01:43:19.240 --> 01:43:21.840]   I would have made sense of this, but this is the way I developed Google.
[01:43:21.840 --> 01:43:23.600]   I had to do all these things.
[01:43:23.600 --> 01:43:24.920]   You're too far gone.
[01:43:24.920 --> 01:43:27.880]   Forward your email from one email account to the other.
[01:43:27.880 --> 01:43:28.880]   Oh!
[01:43:28.880 --> 01:43:29.880]   No!
[01:43:29.880 --> 01:43:34.880]   Jeff, your number of the week.
[01:43:34.880 --> 01:43:36.800]   Number is plural.
[01:43:36.800 --> 01:43:40.360]   So everybody, you know, I hear all these shows, everybody, oh Google, they're evil.
[01:43:40.360 --> 01:43:41.800]   Oh, I don't want Google to have that.
[01:43:41.800 --> 01:43:43.480]   Oh, we know he likes Google.
[01:43:43.480 --> 01:43:44.480]   Google's going now.
[01:43:44.480 --> 01:43:51.280]   Well, ABC Washington posted a poll and found that everybody loves Raymond and Google.
[01:43:51.280 --> 01:43:58.240]   82% are favorable to Google, 9% unfavorable, the rest don't know.
[01:43:58.240 --> 01:44:01.360]   Apple, 74%.
[01:44:01.360 --> 01:44:03.200]   Facebook, 58%.
[01:44:03.200 --> 01:44:11.160]   Twitter, interestingly, 34% unfavorable, 36% unfavorable, 31% don't know.
[01:44:11.160 --> 01:44:14.640]   But no question here, the world loves Google.
[01:44:14.640 --> 01:44:18.560]   So we're going to keep calling the show this week in Google.
[01:44:18.560 --> 01:44:23.120]   You know, it's interesting to me how many in the world don't love Twitter.
[01:44:23.120 --> 01:44:25.920]   Isn't that amazing?
[01:44:25.920 --> 01:44:27.400]   Why do people hate Twitter so much?
[01:44:27.400 --> 01:44:28.400]   I don't know.
[01:44:28.400 --> 01:44:31.440]   I think they don't know numbers very significant there, which may have something to say.
[01:44:31.440 --> 01:44:33.160]   But yeah, just say that you don't...
[01:44:33.160 --> 01:44:34.160]   What is it?
[01:44:34.160 --> 01:44:35.160]   What is it?
[01:44:35.160 --> 01:44:36.160]   Twitter?
[01:44:36.160 --> 01:44:38.120]   I think it could be a couple of things.
[01:44:38.120 --> 01:44:41.960]   It could be one, number one, it could be most likely that the reputation is, oh, the breakfast
[01:44:41.960 --> 01:44:42.960]   service.
[01:44:42.960 --> 01:44:44.440]   I heard of that.
[01:44:44.440 --> 01:44:48.680]   Number two, it could be...
[01:44:48.680 --> 01:44:49.680]   Right.
[01:44:49.680 --> 01:44:50.680]   Yeah.
[01:44:50.680 --> 01:44:54.560]   Or number three could be what a stupid thing.
[01:44:54.560 --> 01:44:55.560]   I just don't like it.
[01:44:55.560 --> 01:44:56.560]   I guess it's possible.
[01:44:56.560 --> 01:44:57.560]   You never know.
[01:44:57.560 --> 01:44:59.040]   People are people.
[01:44:59.040 --> 01:45:00.920]   I was going to do Springpad, but I can't find my...
[01:45:00.920 --> 01:45:02.160]   I can't remember my password.
[01:45:02.160 --> 01:45:09.600]   So it's worth noting it's a Chrome app, but there's iOS and Android apps as well for Springpad.
[01:45:09.600 --> 01:45:13.560]   And they've relaunched in kind of an interesting way, but I can't show you because I'm waiting
[01:45:13.560 --> 01:45:15.800]   for them to send me my password.
[01:45:15.800 --> 01:45:17.120]   But it's got more social in it.
[01:45:17.120 --> 01:45:20.760]   It was always a notepad app, kind of like an ever note that I liked a lot.
[01:45:20.760 --> 01:45:24.680]   I think I'd recommended it in the past if you haven't used Springpad in a while or if
[01:45:24.680 --> 01:45:27.720]   you've never used it, go to the Chrome store and install it and take a look.
[01:45:27.720 --> 01:45:31.480]   Meanwhile, I'm going to actually show you something that's frankly a hell of a lot more
[01:45:31.480 --> 01:45:34.520]   useful than anything anybody said in this entire show.
[01:45:34.520 --> 01:45:39.800]   It is the Zombie Survival Map, a map of thedead.com.
[01:45:39.800 --> 01:45:43.240]   When the zombieapocalypse.com comes...
[01:45:43.240 --> 01:45:46.200]   I just created a new thing, the zombieapocalypse.com.
[01:45:46.200 --> 01:45:47.720]   This is me in Petaluma.
[01:45:47.720 --> 01:45:49.440]   You see I'm armed heavily.
[01:45:49.440 --> 01:45:53.080]   And it will show me the gun store, the convenience store, the hardware store, the liquor store,
[01:45:53.080 --> 01:45:58.960]   the outdoor store, military police, radio towers, gas stations, harbors, hospitals,
[01:45:58.960 --> 01:46:06.120]   everything you need to survive the zombie apocalypse, including the location of the nearest cemetery,
[01:46:06.120 --> 01:46:08.920]   which of course is where they'll all be coming from.
[01:46:08.920 --> 01:46:11.000]   It's a Google Map mashup.
[01:46:11.000 --> 01:46:15.240]   The map of the dead wants to track your physical location, Chrome tells me.
[01:46:15.240 --> 01:46:16.440]   Hell yeah!
[01:46:16.440 --> 01:46:17.720]   Uh, deny?
[01:46:17.720 --> 01:46:19.320]   No, no!
[01:46:19.320 --> 01:46:22.680]   It'll show you danger zones, it'll show you no danger zones.
[01:46:22.680 --> 01:46:24.840]   I mean, this is good.
[01:46:24.840 --> 01:46:30.920]   I'm right now there are no zombies in the area, so I feel much better.
[01:46:30.920 --> 01:46:31.920]   I feel much better.
[01:46:31.920 --> 01:46:32.920]   Really?
[01:46:32.920 --> 01:46:34.440]   The internet'd be running when the apocalypse comes.
[01:46:34.440 --> 01:46:37.320]   Better memorize all this.
[01:46:37.320 --> 01:46:38.320]   This is good.
[01:46:38.320 --> 01:46:39.320]   Mapofthedead.com.
[01:46:39.320 --> 01:46:40.480]   You see the red zones?
[01:46:40.480 --> 01:46:42.240]   That's where the zombies could be.
[01:46:42.240 --> 01:46:46.440]   And look, here's a department of Homeland Security installation I didn't even know about,
[01:46:46.440 --> 01:46:48.160]   so that's good to know.
[01:46:48.160 --> 01:46:50.160]   Mapofthedead.
[01:46:50.160 --> 01:46:52.160]   People who need lives.com.
[01:46:52.160 --> 01:46:53.160]   Oh!
[01:46:53.160 --> 01:46:54.160]   Oh!
[01:46:54.160 --> 01:46:55.160]   Oh!
[01:46:55.160 --> 01:46:58.680]   You know, planning for the zombie apocalypse is not optional.
[01:46:58.680 --> 01:47:03.280]   Mike Elgin, did you have anything you'd like to share at this juncture?
[01:47:03.280 --> 01:47:04.280]   Just a quick thing.
[01:47:04.280 --> 01:47:07.280]   People always ask me, "How do I automate a bunch of stuff?
[01:47:07.280 --> 01:47:12.560]   Where did I get my RSS feed for Google+, where did it, how do I automate posting to Twitter,
[01:47:12.560 --> 01:47:13.640]   etc, etc.?"
[01:47:13.640 --> 01:47:17.960]   And the best resource that I'm aware of is a site called SociologyPlus.com.
[01:47:17.960 --> 01:47:18.960]   Wow!
[01:47:18.960 --> 01:47:26.120]   And this is basically an all-purpose information resource/blog for Google+.
[01:47:26.120 --> 01:47:31.920]   But the upper right-hand corner has a menu item called Tips and Resources under which
[01:47:31.920 --> 01:47:35.800]   you can find an option called Guides.
[01:47:35.800 --> 01:47:43.080]   And the top item there links to 11 categories of Tips, Guides, and Resources.
[01:47:43.080 --> 01:47:44.080]   This is great.
[01:47:44.080 --> 01:47:45.080]   Yeah.
[01:47:45.080 --> 01:47:47.440]   So you see Tips and Resources over on the right on the top.
[01:47:47.440 --> 01:47:53.800]   It's a great site just for learning about Google+ and all the things that are possible.
[01:47:53.800 --> 01:47:59.080]   But these resources, if you look under, like, for example, if you look at Section 8, extensions
[01:47:59.080 --> 01:48:00.240]   tools and apps.
[01:48:00.240 --> 01:48:02.240]   And I presume they're keeping this up today, right?
[01:48:02.240 --> 01:48:03.240]   Yes.
[01:48:03.240 --> 01:48:04.240]   I believe they are.
[01:48:04.240 --> 01:48:10.840]   This is just, there are so many different resources available for browser plugins and
[01:48:10.840 --> 01:48:15.720]   all kinds of services that exist that let you automate things, optimize things.
[01:48:15.720 --> 01:48:19.880]   You can do things like, you know, on TV, when you're on Fox News and they put the, you know,
[01:48:19.880 --> 01:48:23.040]   Jeff Jarvis, Musmaching.com or whatever underneath.
[01:48:23.040 --> 01:48:24.960]   You can do that for Hangout, you can have your own.
[01:48:24.960 --> 01:48:25.960]   I was wondering.
[01:48:25.960 --> 01:48:26.960]   Oh.
[01:48:26.960 --> 01:48:27.960]   Yeah.
[01:48:27.960 --> 01:48:28.960]   That's cool.
[01:48:28.960 --> 01:48:29.960]   Yeah.
[01:48:29.960 --> 01:48:35.360]   But there's just, you can spend all your time on this site finding ways to customize and
[01:48:35.360 --> 01:48:36.920]   automate Google+.
[01:48:36.920 --> 01:48:39.200]   You think I appear on Fox News?
[01:48:39.200 --> 01:48:40.200]   No.
[01:48:40.200 --> 01:48:41.360]   Okay.
[01:48:41.360 --> 01:48:46.680]   They asked me once.
[01:48:46.680 --> 01:48:47.680]   There you go.
[01:48:47.680 --> 01:48:49.640]   It's called Sociology Plus.
[01:48:49.640 --> 01:48:50.640]   Sociology.
[01:48:50.640 --> 01:48:51.640]   So CIO.
[01:48:51.640 --> 01:48:55.240]   L-O-G-Y-P-L-U-S.com, the sociology of Google.
[01:48:55.240 --> 01:48:57.520]   Plus, that's where you'll find Mike Elgin.
[01:48:57.520 --> 01:49:01.760]   If you just go to elgin.elgann.com, you'll pull it, pull it your right to his Google+ account.
[01:49:01.760 --> 01:49:04.760]   You should follow him there.
[01:49:04.760 --> 01:49:10.600]   He also writes for Computer World and anything else you want to plug?
[01:49:10.600 --> 01:49:17.160]   Just every Thursday morning at nine o'clock, I do a live streaming Hangout.
[01:49:17.160 --> 01:49:21.200]   It's never, almost never about tech, but I find communities on Google+.
[01:49:21.200 --> 01:49:24.800]   People who are doing interesting things, for example, I did one on Lego Maniacs at Chris
[01:49:24.800 --> 01:49:28.760]   Perillo and other Lego Maniacs, and we talk about their passions and how they use Google
[01:49:28.760 --> 01:49:33.240]   Plus to build community around their whatever it is they're doing.
[01:49:33.240 --> 01:49:34.960]   I did filmmakers.
[01:49:34.960 --> 01:49:38.240]   We did even skateboarders, stuff like that.
[01:49:38.240 --> 01:49:39.760]   It's a lot of fun.
[01:49:39.760 --> 01:49:43.320]   It lasts only half an hour and Thursday morning at nine a.m.
[01:49:43.320 --> 01:49:44.320]   I have to join.
[01:49:44.320 --> 01:49:45.320]   Thank you.
[01:49:45.320 --> 01:49:46.960]   It's called The Flying Circle.
[01:49:46.960 --> 01:49:49.880]   Jeff Jarvis is a professor of journalism at the City University of New York.
[01:49:49.880 --> 01:49:54.520]   The author of public parts is latest book, and of course, don't forget the Amazon single.
[01:49:54.520 --> 01:49:56.600]   Gutenberg, the geek.
[01:49:56.600 --> 01:49:57.600]   You said it.
[01:49:57.600 --> 01:49:58.600]   I didn't.
[01:49:58.600 --> 01:49:59.600]   [laughter]
[01:49:59.600 --> 01:50:05.640]   Follow him on everywhere, Google+ and Twitter, the hated Twitter at Jeff Jarvis.
[01:50:05.640 --> 01:50:12.320]   Gina Tarpani blogs at smarterware.org, and she's also the author of Think Up, the
[01:50:12.320 --> 01:50:16.680]   amazing app at Think Up App.com, and she's living long and prospering because...
[01:50:16.680 --> 01:50:17.680]   I think too.
[01:50:17.680 --> 01:50:20.240]   What is that word that you use that you and Zoe are?
[01:50:20.240 --> 01:50:21.240]   Dorkable.
[01:50:21.240 --> 01:50:22.240]   Dorkable.
[01:50:22.240 --> 01:50:23.240]   I aspire to be a Dorkable.
[01:50:23.240 --> 01:50:24.240]   She's a Dorkable.
[01:50:24.240 --> 01:50:29.040]   I'm telling you, I'm telling you, it's our new show on the Twit.
[01:50:29.040 --> 01:50:31.880]   Gina Tarpani is a Dorkable.
[01:50:31.880 --> 01:50:32.880]   I'm there.
[01:50:32.880 --> 01:50:33.880]   I think it's great.
[01:50:33.880 --> 01:50:34.880]   In the classes.
[01:50:34.880 --> 01:50:35.880]   Do it.
[01:50:35.880 --> 01:50:36.880]   In the classes.
[01:50:36.880 --> 01:50:37.880]   Glee guys.
[01:50:37.880 --> 01:50:39.760]   One Twit length review.
[01:50:39.760 --> 01:50:41.000]   Is there a Nukely?
[01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:42.000]   Was there a Nukely?
[01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:43.000]   Nukely Last Night.
[01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:47.840]   Best Song was the last five minutes, which Eileen sent me the YouTube video last week.
[01:50:47.840 --> 01:50:48.840]   Really good.
[01:50:48.840 --> 01:50:49.840]   But you know what?
[01:50:49.840 --> 01:50:51.160]   The Glee Cast was on inside the actor studio this week on Bravo.
[01:50:51.160 --> 01:50:52.200]   It was also very good.
[01:50:52.200 --> 01:50:54.400]   I won't bore you all, but yeah.
[01:50:54.400 --> 01:50:55.960]   It's the whole cast, really.
[01:50:55.960 --> 01:50:57.440]   By that would be cool.
[01:50:57.440 --> 01:50:59.440]   Writing storylines, not so great.
[01:50:59.440 --> 01:51:00.440]   Music's still pretty good.
[01:51:00.440 --> 01:51:01.440]   Yeah, the storylines.
[01:51:01.440 --> 01:51:02.440]   That's my tweet line from you.
[01:51:02.440 --> 01:51:03.840]   Not as crazy storyline.
[01:51:03.840 --> 01:51:05.920]   And I just wanted to complete the drinking game.
[01:51:05.920 --> 01:51:07.240]   You're welcome, world.
[01:51:07.240 --> 01:51:10.480]   They're all passed out.
[01:51:10.480 --> 01:51:11.480]   And thanks for joining us.
[01:51:11.480 --> 01:51:15.240]   We'll see you next time on this week and Google TNT is coming up next.
[01:51:15.240 --> 01:51:25.240]   [MUSIC]
[01:51:25.240 --> 01:51:27.820]   (somber music)
