[00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.260]   I have to think, what show am I doing?
[00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.180]   This is time for Twig.
[00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.660]   This week in Google, a show where we get together and chat, chat, chat about all sorts of stuff
[00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.820]   with Stacey Higginbotham from StaceyOnIOT.com, gigastacey on the Twitter.
[00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:44.820]   Hello Stacey.
[00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:45.820]   Hello.
[00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:50.060]   I always have this like 80 sitcom moment where I'm like, "Hi everybody."
[00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.060]   It is.
[00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.060]   It's very much.
[00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.860]   Can you throw your hat in the air and change the world with your smile?
[00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:55.860]   That would be awesome.
[00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.940]   You are kind of the Mary Tyler Moore of this show, which means Jeff Jarvis is the Lou
[00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.700]   Grand of this show.
[00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:05.700]   Mary!
[00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:11.020]   Jeff Jarvis is your Letter to Top Professor for journalistic innovation at the...
[00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:19.020]   Graduate School of Journalism at the SIT D University of New York and our very own...
[00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:20.820]   You're a little curmudgeonly.
[00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.180]   You've always been.
[00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:24.820]   Your name was...
[00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.020]   He's glaring at me.
[00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:29.580]   Your name was invoked on the Tech Guy show.
[00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:36.540]   We were talking about the fact that the International Space Station is going to be deorbited into
[00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:37.540]   the ocean.
[00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:38.540]   Wow.
[00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.620]   That's the famous story.
[00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.020]   Since Anne hasn't heard it, I'm going to introduce Anne, then I'm going to let you tell that
[00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:44.020]   story.
[00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:45.020]   I can't really tell the story.
[00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:47.620]   It's also here from Hands-On Photography.
[00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.260]   An age out of that conversation.
[00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:55.900]   A page out completely as both you and Stacey are too young to remember this.
[00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:01.100]   Also, as the content manager, the actually we call him the membership.
[00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:02.100]   What do you call it?
[00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.940]   He doesn't manage the content.
[00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.540]   He manages people and relationships and love.
[00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:07.700]   The guy.
[00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:15.060]   The guy in our club, Club Twit, and you have arranged a fun event for this Friday.
[00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:21.620]   The love manager has arranged for the love boat.
[00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.020]   He's a gastro-nomad experience.
[00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:25.020]   Yes.
[00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.020]   Yes.
[00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:29.420]   Mr. Mike Elgin hosted by you, the Chief Twit on Friday.
[00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:30.420]   Yes.
[00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:31.420]   In the mirror will be 11.
[00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:32.420]   Yep.
[00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:33.780]   4 p.m. Pacific.
[00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.180]   It's going to be exciting.
[00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:36.180]   Yep.
[00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:37.180]   It's going to be exciting.
[00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.780]   So, Ant, in 1979, were you born?
[00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.420]   No, you weren't even...
[00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:45.740]   Oh, no, Jesus, don't do that to me.
[00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:46.740]   Were you born?
[00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:47.740]   I was born.
[00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:48.740]   You were born, but you were like one.
[00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.060]   I won't say how old I was, but I was born.
[00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.740]   Stacey was not.
[00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.940]   I was born, but wait, 1973?
[00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:55.940]   Nine.
[00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:56.940]   Nine.
[00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:57.940]   Oh, nine.
[00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:58.940]   Yes, yes, I was born.
[00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:59.940]   I was one.
[00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:04.260]   You were too young probably to read the San Francisco Examiner.
[00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:05.260]   However, I was a devoted...
[00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:06.260]   I was not able to read.
[00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260]   I was a devoted fan.
[00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:09.260]   I'm surprised, Stacey.
[00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.420]   I thought you were quite advanced.
[00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:14.900]   Advanced, yes.
[00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:15.900]   Tell us the story.
[00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:16.900]   Because Skylab...
[00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:17.900]   Go ahead.
[00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:22.900]   Well, Skylab was a satellite that was up there with astronauts working, and up ahead of the
[00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:31.540]   International Space Station, and it had its day, and was going to come back to Earth.
[00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:35.180]   And there was much nervousness about where it was going to come.
[00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:36.820]   NASA was saying, "No, no, no, no, no problem.
[00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:37.820]   No problem at all.
[00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:40.580]   We got in control, but still there was nervousness."
[00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:43.660]   And I worked on the San Francisco Examiner, which was right across the hall in the San Francisco
[00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:47.740]   Chronicle in a joint publishing agreement, and we shared the same composing room.
[00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:52.500]   So we weren't supposed to be at all in each other's business, but of course we're nosey
[00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:53.660]   journalists.
[00:05:53.660 --> 00:06:00.140]   So I went out there, and I saw that they had a promotion coming up for Skylab Insurance.
[00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:04.980]   That if a reader, a subscriber to the Chronicle got hit by falling pieces of Skylab and
[00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:08.580]   lost their life or limb, they would get money from the Chronicle.
[00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:11.900]   And this was going to break on, I think, the Monday or something.
[00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:15.620]   And by the way, this is mostly a joke, because the Earth is a lot of water, and the chance
[00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:18.580]   of you being hit by the Skylab is pretty slim.
[00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:19.580]   So it's a safe bet.
[00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.260]   And a lot of newspapers did this.
[00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:23.140]   This is a very common promotion.
[00:06:23.140 --> 00:06:26.420]   So we thought, we said, "How can we beat the Chronicle of this?"
[00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:29.660]   And we talked about it, and I said, "Why don't we do a reward for bringing us a piece
[00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:30.660]   of Skylab?"
[00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:32.060]   $10,000 reward bringing us pieces out.
[00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:36.300]   The city editor, he said, "Ah, it's great."
[00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:41.140]   So we had to go to the publisher, got in Reg Murphy, who became my bet noir, and tried
[00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:42.140]   to talk him into it.
[00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:46.580]   And he made me call NASA to say, "What are the odds this has fallen on land?"
[00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:49.220]   I don't want to give up any money.
[00:06:49.220 --> 00:06:51.420]   You get their guarantee, and I called NASA the...
[00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:57.340]   I mean, the United States, because you had one additional caveat, which it had to be,
[00:06:57.340 --> 00:07:02.260]   had to arrive at the offices of the San Francisco Examiner by a certain time.
[00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:04.260]   You had 72 hours...
[00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:05.260]   Last, like that, right.
[00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.460]   To get to the Chronicle or the Examiner.
[00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:08.780]   So the Examiner, yes.
[00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:11.660]   So I called NASA, they said, "Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
[00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:12.660]   you know."
[00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:15.620]   I said, "By the way, just in case we do get it, will you verify that the stuff we got
[00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:16.620]   is real?
[00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:17.620]   Will you certify it?"
[00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:19.660]   Oh, sure, because I thought it happened, yeah, no problem.
[00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:20.660]   Right.
[00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:22.700]   So then it came down to Earth.
[00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:24.660]   It fell in Australia.
[00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:25.660]   Western...
[00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:30.980]   Earth, Western Australia, sparsely populated Western Australia around Earth.
[00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:31.980]   Very few.
[00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:37.340]   But a young beer truck, help driver's helper, beer truck driver helper named Stan Thornton
[00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:41.620]   and his might picked up these black pieces of charcoal.
[00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:45.820]   Now, meanwhile, a radio station in Australia, because he had to come to our offices and
[00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:47.500]   everything, it's going to get $10,000.
[00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:51.260]   Well, a radio station in Australia did a whole big campaign that they were going to pay for
[00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:55.260]   anybody to get to our offices to get their money from Yanks.
[00:07:55.260 --> 00:08:01.940]   So in fact, young Stan, who was 17 years old, flies to Sydney, flies to us, makes it like
[00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:02.940]   within an hour.
[00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:04.420]   He didn't bring a passport.
[00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:05.660]   He didn't bring a suitcase.
[00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:06.660]   Right.
[00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:07.660]   He just popped on.
[00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:08.660]   Yeah.
[00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:09.660]   Yeah.
[00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:10.740]   And he said he's a miter.
[00:08:10.740 --> 00:08:14.580]   So he arrives at our offices with this baggie with black charcoal things.
[00:08:14.580 --> 00:08:16.420]   Oh, I got it right here.
[00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:17.420]   Yeah.
[00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:18.420]   And so...
[00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:19.820]   That's my $10,000.
[00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:23.580]   We do pictures in the front of the building, and we'll have Stan arrives at the airport,
[00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:25.700]   Stan gets in, he makes it in time.
[00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:28.340]   So then we have to get the stuff certified.
[00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:32.540]   Meanwhile, the managing editor, David Halverson, was concerned for Stan.
[00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:33.540]   He was a kid.
[00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:34.540]   He had no suitcase.
[00:08:34.540 --> 00:08:35.540]   He had nothing.
[00:08:35.540 --> 00:08:36.740]   So they take in Stan and it was...
[00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:40.940]   He basically adopt him for like 10 days.
[00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:45.580]   So then somebody had to go to Alabama, to NASA to get them to certify.
[00:08:45.580 --> 00:08:51.540]   So we sent Steve Cook, an editor who was literally the LA Times, to NASA in Huntsville,
[00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:52.900]   and they took it seriously.
[00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:55.300]   They had to analyze it and they couldn't figure out what it was.
[00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:56.780]   They said, "Well, this is...
[00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:57.780]   This is...
[00:08:57.780 --> 00:08:58.940]   Okay, anything on Skylab.
[00:08:58.940 --> 00:08:59.940]   This is organic.
[00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:00.940]   There's nothing on Skylab."
[00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:01.940]   Oh, no.
[00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:06.620]   And they thought and thought and they said, "Well, it could be astronaut poop.
[00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:07.620]   We don't think so."
[00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:10.260]   I did find this part in the story.
[00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:11.260]   That's great.
[00:09:11.260 --> 00:09:12.260]   Yeah, that's great.
[00:09:12.260 --> 00:09:18.740]   They finally determined that it was balsa wood in the insulation of the Skylab.
[00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:22.700]   And so we then gave $10,000 to...
[00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:24.460]   You're going to hear a few more things you had before.
[00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:25.780]   So we gave $10,000 to Stan.
[00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:32.100]   Meanwhile, a Philadelphia rug merchant, literally a rug merchant wanted to jump on the bandwagon
[00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:33.100]   of all this publicity.
[00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:37.580]   So he offered Stan a house full of furnishings and a trip to Philadelphia to see the Liberty
[00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:38.580]   Bell.
[00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:39.580]   Right?
[00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:41.580]   And Stan, we said, "Stan, we don't think this is a good idea."
[00:09:41.580 --> 00:09:42.580]   Stan said, "No, Mike."
[00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:44.580]   And he brought in his mother and his girlfriend.
[00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:45.580]   Oh, my God.
[00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:46.740]   And they went to Philadelphia, right?
[00:09:46.740 --> 00:09:48.700]   And then, you know, sometime later, he guys not paying.
[00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:49.700]   "You help?
[00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:52.260]   Stan, we tried to warn you, man."
[00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:54.380]   So Stan goes back to Australia.
[00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:57.020]   Now, meanwhile, I got lots of attention.
[00:09:57.020 --> 00:10:00.940]   I made a point of always wearing three-piece suits because I was so embarrassed at this.
[00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:03.580]   I tried to look dignified.
[00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:04.820]   And I can't do three-piece suits.
[00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:06.620]   I just not look dignified, by the way.
[00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:08.940]   And so I got tons of publicity, right?
[00:10:08.940 --> 00:10:11.700]   I was on TV all over and everything.
[00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:15.180]   Reg Murphy, the publisher, was very jealous of this.
[00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:20.420]   He was not happy that I was getting more publicity and he'd given up to $10,000.
[00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:25.020]   He proceeded to make my life pretty damn miserable with the help of Diane Feinstein's
[00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:28.700]   husband, Dick Bloom, who they didn't like me anyway because I once in a while criticized
[00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:29.700]   Feinstein.
[00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:35.060]   They made my life a living hell and I eventually quit to come to New York and conquer Gotham
[00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:37.300]   and work for People magazine.
[00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:41.020]   And the day after I quit, Murphy quit.
[00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:42.020]   In Australia.
[00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:47.060]   I remember you saying you got a little bit of trouble for this.
[00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:50.660]   Like you had promised there's no way we're going to be giving away $10,000.
[00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:53.860]   He got so much more than $10,000 publicity for this.
[00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:56.380]   Oh Lord, it was all over.
[00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:59.860]   And Radio in San Francisco was doing it all the time and Stan was getting interviewed and
[00:10:59.860 --> 00:11:01.460]   I was getting interviewed.
[00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:02.860]   It was embarrassing fun.
[00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:06.980]   It was the last gasp of old newspaper-y, right?
[00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:07.980]   Old kind of Hearst newspaper-y.
[00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:12.380]   In those days you had the morning paper, the Chronicle and the afternoon paper, the Examiner
[00:11:12.380 --> 00:11:14.660]   and you guys were fighting.
[00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:15.980]   Even if you were- We had separate owners.
[00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:16.980]   Yeah.
[00:11:16.980 --> 00:11:17.980]   Yeah.
[00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:18.980]   Yeah.
[00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:19.980]   Yeah.
[00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:20.980]   Coherstoned Examiner.
[00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:21.980]   Who owned- Oh, the Chronicle.
[00:11:21.980 --> 00:11:22.980]   The Chronicle.
[00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:23.980]   Yeah.
[00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:24.980]   The Underground.
[00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:25.980]   Yeah.
[00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:26.980]   The Underground.
[00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:27.980]   They were right.
[00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:27.980]   And then as you know, the Unsampers just don't know when the young got out and her spotted, they
[00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:32.860]   had to keep the Examiner going in some form and they took over the Chronicle name because
[00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:34.460]   it was the bigger name by far.
[00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:38.740]   But the Examiner was old, we ran off Hearst's first paper.
[00:11:38.740 --> 00:11:41.780]   It meant something in the company and they gave it up which is kind of a shame.
[00:11:41.780 --> 00:11:42.780]   Yeah.
[00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:46.220]   They turned it into a dopey tabloid, weekly tabloid.
[00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:47.220]   It was very sad.
[00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:48.220]   I liked the Examiner.
[00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:49.620]   It was a great newspaper.
[00:11:49.620 --> 00:11:56.060]   Anyway, that may happen again because the space station is going to be- In 2035, so
[00:11:56.060 --> 00:11:57.740]   you've got a little time to save up for that.
[00:11:57.740 --> 00:11:59.820]   Are they going to take it apart and bring it down or-
[00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:00.820]   No, no, no.
[00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:02.660]   They're just going to crash it in the Indian Ocean.
[00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:03.660]   No.
[00:12:03.660 --> 00:12:04.660]   But they think-
[00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:05.660]   That's kind of sad.
[00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:10.300]   The problem with Skylab- The problem with the Skylab was that they hadn't planned for
[00:12:10.300 --> 00:12:11.300]   this.
[00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:12.300]   So, right.
[00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:17.100]   They didn't have any way to kind of aim it on its way in.
[00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:20.340]   So it was an unplanned, unscheduled demise.
[00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:22.940]   But with the ISS they know.
[00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:27.460]   So recently I'd never heard from Stan and then I got two people calling me wanting to
[00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:30.180]   do kind of the story of Skylab and Stan.
[00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:31.780]   I spent time with him, nothing ever happened with it.
[00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:34.580]   But through that I got connected with Stan and got an email with each other.
[00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:36.140]   Oh, that's nice.
[00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:41.780]   And that guy, by the way, Stan is now 65-year-old retiree living in Huntsville, Alabama.
[00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:44.820]   So it goes completely full circle.
[00:12:44.820 --> 00:12:47.860]   Samsung announced this morning bright and early.
[00:12:47.860 --> 00:12:51.860]   Thank you, Jason Howell, for actually coming in on the air.
[00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:54.780]   7 AM our time.
[00:12:54.780 --> 00:12:57.620]   A phone that everybody already knew everything about.
[00:12:57.620 --> 00:13:02.740]   In fact, Samsung had already encouraged existing owners to pre-order weeks ago.
[00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:04.860]   So this was not a surprise.
[00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:14.180]   The Samsung Galaxy S22, the S22+ and of most interest, I think, to us, the S22 Ultra.
[00:13:14.180 --> 00:13:18.940]   Not because it's the most expensive, but because it is, in fact, the Galaxy Note, which they
[00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:19.940]   had killed.
[00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:23.300]   But not only does it look just like a Note, it's got a stylus.
[00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:25.580]   I mean, doesn't that look like the Note to you?
[00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:29.900]   I mean, it's big, I think, 6.8 inches.
[00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:33.260]   And it's impossible to buy.
[00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:35.940]   Samsung opened pre-orders today.
[00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:39.940]   And Jason Howell and I and many others rustle our IT guy.
[00:13:39.940 --> 00:13:42.900]   We all been trying to bang it on the site, trying to get in.
[00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:45.660]   I finally just ordered it from Verizon and built a bullet.
[00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:46.660]   Nice job, de-dossing them.
[00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:49.260]   Yeah, we de-dossed or what?
[00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:50.260]   Something bad happened.
[00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:51.260]   I don't know.
[00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:55.540]   6.8-inch screen built in S-Pen, boat loaded cameras, four cameras on the back.
[00:13:55.540 --> 00:14:01.980]   A very high quality selfie cam, because after all, we know that's the most important thing.
[00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:03.220]   That's the one that matters, right?
[00:14:03.220 --> 00:14:04.220]   That's what matters.
[00:14:04.220 --> 00:14:10.420]   They're doing that 100X zoom again, optical, which, no, not a... is it 10X optical?
[00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:11.700]   No, it's 10X optical.
[00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:12.700]   No.
[00:14:12.700 --> 00:14:16.140]   3X, they've got four lenses.
[00:14:16.140 --> 00:14:21.940]   I would think you'd want this, and actually, does 45 watt fast charging.
[00:14:21.940 --> 00:14:25.460]   Small battery, though, 5,000 milliamp hour battery.
[00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:34.140]   I would like to support Wi-Fi 6E, the latest, as well as 5G.
[00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:36.020]   Are four cameras?
[00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:39.420]   Is that like five blades on your razor or is it functional?
[00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:40.420]   Exactly.
[00:14:40.420 --> 00:14:42.420]   No, it's perfect analogy.
[00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:44.420]   Perfect analogy.
[00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:45.420]   Okay.
[00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:52.140]   So you get 108 megapixel main camera, 108, probably by pixel shifting, right?
[00:14:52.140 --> 00:14:53.140]   Yeah, pixel bending.
[00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:54.140]   Yeah.
[00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:55.140]   Don't buy into it.
[00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:56.140]   It's not really.
[00:14:56.140 --> 00:15:04.500]   3X and 10X telephoto cameras, two of them, two lenses, a 12 megapixel ultra wide.
[00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:09.220]   And then on the front, you get a 40 megapixel selfie camera.
[00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:13.260]   What is the real... do you know on these, when they do this binning, is it one quarter
[00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:14.260]   of that?
[00:15:14.260 --> 00:15:15.700]   Is it really 10 megapixels times four?
[00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:17.260]   Usually you can one quarter.
[00:15:17.260 --> 00:15:18.260]   Yeah.
[00:15:18.260 --> 00:15:19.260]   Yeah.
[00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:21.060]   So they're going to do the night mode.
[00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:27.700]   You know, all to compete with, I think the unfortunate, binited pixel 6 Pro, which is
[00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:32.620]   really, I think Google says it's sold better than any phone ever they've ever made.
[00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:33.620]   But we don't know.
[00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:36.580]   That's not saying much because we never sold a lot anyway.
[00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:37.580]   Yeah.
[00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:39.420]   We don't know what that means.
[00:15:39.420 --> 00:15:43.020]   And still people are complaining even after the February update just came out and they're
[00:15:43.020 --> 00:15:44.860]   still complaining about some features.
[00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:46.100]   How's yours?
[00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:49.260]   And I know you weren't happy with the pixel reading and all that.
[00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:51.100]   The phone is still fine.
[00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:52.340]   It's just the operating system.
[00:15:52.340 --> 00:15:53.540]   And this is where it screams.
[00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:54.540]   It's the software.
[00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:55.540]   Yeah.
[00:15:55.540 --> 00:15:56.540]   It's the...
[00:15:56.540 --> 00:15:57.540]   Which I can say.
[00:15:57.540 --> 00:15:58.540]   Yeah.
[00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:03.220]   And this last update, I did it a couple of days ago for the February one and I still
[00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:08.260]   had a Bluetooth drop this morning on my way to the studio, just random Bluetooth drop.
[00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:09.260]   Yeah.
[00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:10.260]   Well, that's the one I mean.
[00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:13.420]   You can't be a teacher that says, "I still hate Android 12."
[00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:18.660]   And you can just wear it after every update and be like, "I'm not working."
[00:16:18.660 --> 00:16:19.660]   I like the phone.
[00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:26.380]   You want me to sit down with it and go through Lightroom Mobile on it and process photos.
[00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:27.380]   Great for that.
[00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:32.740]   You want me to hop into Premiere Rush and do a little quick Instagram reel.
[00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:33.740]   Great for that.
[00:16:33.740 --> 00:16:38.020]   If you want me to just go out and shoot footage of the hardheads doing some training in slow
[00:16:38.020 --> 00:16:39.860]   mode, it's great for that.
[00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:43.380]   But the OS, just not my thing.
[00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:45.660]   Now I'm curious because Jeff might be interested in this.
[00:16:45.660 --> 00:16:52.340]   We also announced their new tablet, the S8 Ultra with a giant screen.
[00:16:52.340 --> 00:16:55.180]   It's really a laptop pretending to be.
[00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:58.660]   No, I want to, I want to, I want to, I want to, I want to my Nexus 7, 7 inches fits in
[00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:01.460]   the jacket pocket, fixed in the back pocket.
[00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:02.780]   I want that.
[00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:07.540]   The, yeah, no, I'm, I kind of with you, I actually, I have a 12.9 inch iPad Pro and I
[00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:11.180]   end up using the mini because it is a little bit nicer.
[00:17:11.180 --> 00:17:14.660]   So, well, it's where I'm using it and stuff like that.
[00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:16.780]   I don't, I don't want to, and that's the problem.
[00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:18.420]   This is a, it's a laptop.
[00:17:18.420 --> 00:17:26.340]   It's a 14.6 inch screen, 2960 by 1848, 240 pixels an inch.
[00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:29.460]   Like the phones, it has 120 hertz refresh.
[00:17:29.460 --> 00:17:32.500]   The phones actually go even faster.
[00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:37.860]   So it's, it's a little lower resolution than a 12.9 inch iPad Pro, but it's a big, but
[00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:39.980]   that's because it's a bigger screen.
[00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:45.620]   And they are, I think, if you buy right away, they bundle the keyboard with it, but it's
[00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:47.500]   still very, it's not cheap.
[00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:49.420]   It's a very expensive device.
[00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:56.140]   I think 1,100, 1,200 bucks is a starting price competing kind of head to head against
[00:17:56.140 --> 00:17:58.220]   Apple's iPad Pro.
[00:17:58.220 --> 00:18:00.420]   There's a pen, yes.
[00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:02.260]   Comes, I mean, there's, that's a big difference.
[00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:04.700]   It comes with a pen and keyboard.
[00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:06.940]   So that doesn't save you money.
[00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:08.620]   How big is the screen again?
[00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:10.260]   14 point something.
[00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:11.980]   It's, it's what confused me about the red.
[00:18:11.980 --> 00:18:12.980]   It's a laptop.
[00:18:12.980 --> 00:18:15.220]   I think it's the eight and I think it's going to be eight inches.
[00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:17.340]   No, no, no, it's, no, sorry.
[00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:19.260]   14.6, it's a laptop screen.
[00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:21.260]   It's bigger than the laptop's actually.
[00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:22.260]   Yeah.
[00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:23.260]   Yeah.
[00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:24.820]   So that makes you a witch.
[00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:26.940]   Why not just get a laptop?
[00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:31.380]   Well, yeah, I mean, I think this has always been the problem with Android tablets is the
[00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:36.100]   software is just not there compared to say iOS.
[00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:41.220]   This one has decks built into it, which is weird because decks was originally the idea
[00:18:41.220 --> 00:18:45.860]   was you take a Samsung phone, you dock it, now you have a screen, keyboard, a mouse, and
[00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:48.380]   it's a computer using the CPU on the phone.
[00:18:48.380 --> 00:18:53.900]   But decks kind of works on the tablet like another operating system on the, because it's
[00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:56.140]   a big, it's like a computer screen.
[00:18:56.140 --> 00:18:59.180]   I think it's going to be interesting.
[00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:01.060]   That's such a big screen.
[00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:03.620]   It's really more a laptop than it is a tablet.
[00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:07.620]   I think Samsung has done well in both of those, those areas.
[00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:12.500]   They make very nice Android side of the phones as well as the Android side of tablets.
[00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:17.340]   You don't really see any other Android tablets out there that aren't Samsung.
[00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:19.620]   One of the things they talked about in the event, by the way, you can watch the entire
[00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:24.100]   stream of the event on our Twitch news feed with Jason Howell.
[00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:29.700]   One of the things they talked about was you can shoot 4K video with this and it has a
[00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:32.740]   micro SD slot up to a terabyte.
[00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:38.380]   So unlike the iPads, Apple's never equipped the iPads with their best cameras.
[00:19:38.380 --> 00:19:42.340]   Samsung is equipping these laptops with their best cameras.
[00:19:42.340 --> 00:19:47.620]   So they show people taking pictures with this giant laptop and stuff like that.
[00:19:47.620 --> 00:19:49.740]   It gives you a bigger viewfinder, but I don't know.
[00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:52.380]   It is kind of cool, but it's a little un-game.
[00:19:52.380 --> 00:19:55.500]   Is that a function of like remote work, do you think?
[00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:58.700]   Like I might be actually trying to work on this and-
[00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:00.660]   I think it's Samsung.
[00:20:00.660 --> 00:20:05.420]   It's a function of Samsung throwing everything against the wall they can to try to compete
[00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:08.620]   in a field that is completely dominated by Apple's iPad.
[00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:11.060]   Are they all the resources for it?
[00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:12.060]   Yeah.
[00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:13.980]   I mean, if you're going to beat the iPad, how are you going to be?
[00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:15.500]   You're not going to be done on software.
[00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:17.740]   I mean, they showed a drawing program and stuff.
[00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:20.380]   You're going to beat it on hardware.
[00:20:20.380 --> 00:20:24.460]   And so cameras is one way to beat it, including a keyboard and pen.
[00:20:24.460 --> 00:20:29.620]   It's also competing, by the way, against Microsoft Surface, which is kind of the same
[00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:30.620]   idea.
[00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:34.340]   We have a tablet with a detachable keyboard and pen that kind of is like a tablet company.
[00:20:34.340 --> 00:20:38.460]   A lot of people like, if you're in the Windows ecosystem, a lot of people like the Surface
[00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:39.460]   Pro.
[00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:40.460]   I love it.
[00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:41.460]   Yeah.
[00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:42.460]   Yeah.
[00:20:42.460 --> 00:20:43.460]   Yeah.
[00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:51.100]   So I wonder what the Kevin will think of the tab because it's not a Chromebook, but it is
[00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:55.980]   designed to kind of, I think, eat away at that market as well.
[00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:57.460]   The S8 is $700.
[00:20:57.460 --> 00:21:02.380]   You're considering no type of terminal access unless you install some terminal.
[00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:04.340]   Oh, I'm sure there's Android terminal apps.
[00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:05.740]   There are an iOS.
[00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:06.740]   Yeah.
[00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:07.740]   That's right.
[00:21:07.740 --> 00:21:08.740]   He likes the terminal, doesn't he?
[00:21:08.740 --> 00:21:10.380]   I was not to say.
[00:21:10.380 --> 00:21:11.380]   No, Leo, no.
[00:21:11.380 --> 00:21:12.380]   Don't do it.
[00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:13.380]   No, I have.
[00:21:13.380 --> 00:21:15.140]   I showed you how great the terminal is lately.
[00:21:15.140 --> 00:21:18.900]   Did you know you could play Wirtle on the terminal?
[00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:20.500]   I think I'll pass, sir.
[00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:22.500]   Think I'll pass.
[00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:28.060]   Anyway, I think it's interesting.
[00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:34.700]   And of course, both Google and Microsoft are kind of partners in this.
[00:21:34.700 --> 00:21:40.260]   They talked a lot about Microsoft, you know, with your phone and it works with Windows
[00:21:40.260 --> 00:21:41.940]   on the phone and so forth.
[00:21:41.940 --> 00:21:47.660]   And here's Google's keyword blog, unpacking seven features on the latest Samsung Galaxy
[00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:52.940]   devices, which is not something you'd ever really expect to see from Google.
[00:21:52.940 --> 00:21:53.940]   Google.
[00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:54.940]   Yeah.
[00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:55.940]   Yeah.
[00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:56.940]   That's good.
[00:21:56.940 --> 00:22:01.180]   But as Samsung showed in the event, it works with Google Duo.
[00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:07.420]   You can Duo and it works with a Jamboard, which is kind of interesting.
[00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:10.780]   Robert Kinsell, who runs YouTube for Google.
[00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:11.780]   I can't remember.
[00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:12.780]   He's a content guy.
[00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:17.620]   I can't remember what exact title, but he was actually part of the Samsung event.
[00:22:17.620 --> 00:22:25.900]   You could preview YouTube videos on messages by Google on the Samsung optimized for accessibility
[00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:32.420]   with voice access, which is great for people who need accessibility.
[00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:36.180]   They're saying it uses material you, aren't you happy?
[00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:37.180]   Yay.
[00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:38.180]   Yay.
[00:22:38.180 --> 00:22:41.900]   Easy to set up Google Play Apps on your Galaxy Watch 4.
[00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:43.780]   That's another thing.
[00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:50.980]   Samsung talked about a watch using, I think, correct me if I'm wrong, Jason.
[00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:57.340]   I think that it looked to me like they were showing an Android Wear version of the watch.
[00:22:57.340 --> 00:23:01.260]   The new Galaxy Watch is kind of a hybrid, Tizen Wear thing.
[00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:04.140]   So maybe that was, I was just confused by that.
[00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:08.060]   Google Assistant is finally going to come to the Samsung Watch 4.
[00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:09.300]   It did not have the Assistant.
[00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:10.860]   In fact, it still doesn't.
[00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:14.060]   But it's going to be soon.
[00:23:14.060 --> 00:23:16.380]   YouTube Music Premium will work on the watch.
[00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:22.820]   So Google's kind of acting as if it's like they want to play together now, right?
[00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:23.820]   Yeah.
[00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:28.140]   Remember they didn't want it when Samsung would do these unpack presentations.
[00:23:28.140 --> 00:23:30.340]   They would never even say the word.
[00:23:30.340 --> 00:23:31.340]   Remember?
[00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:32.340]   They didn't.
[00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:33.340]   They wouldn't say the A word.
[00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:34.340]   Yeah.
[00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:35.340]   That's right.
[00:23:35.340 --> 00:23:36.340]   Yeah.
[00:23:36.340 --> 00:23:37.340]   I forgot about that.
[00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:38.340]   Yeah.
[00:23:38.340 --> 00:23:41.820]   It says that the watch is Wear 3.
[00:23:41.820 --> 00:23:42.820]   So it's that new.
[00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:45.260]   That's a version that's a collaboration between Google and Samsung.
[00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:48.100]   Is that the first instance of that collaborative?
[00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:49.860]   Well that watch came out earlier.
[00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:50.860]   I have it.
[00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:54.460]   It came out with the flip, I think, the flip 3.
[00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:59.020]   The phone that is now going to be Stacey's.
[00:23:59.020 --> 00:24:00.220]   And the crowd goes wild.
[00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:02.620]   Isn't that exciting?
[00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:06.660]   Because I bought the S22 Ultra so that I can review it.
[00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:08.460]   I did it for you.
[00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:11.900]   And I think it's time for Stacey to have this weird...
[00:24:11.900 --> 00:24:13.700]   It's Stacey's doing it all for herself.
[00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:15.820]   Well you wanted a small phone.
[00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:18.620]   I hope the dog's happy.
[00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:20.180]   You wanted a small phone.
[00:24:20.180 --> 00:24:21.180]   Yes, see?
[00:24:21.180 --> 00:24:22.180]   I knew he was.
[00:24:22.180 --> 00:24:25.180]   Oh God, we're getting a flip 3.
[00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:27.180]   We're getting a flip 3.
[00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:28.180]   Whoa!
[00:24:28.180 --> 00:24:31.180]   Dog's excited and I'm just trying to strike behind me.
[00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:32.420]   Very excited about the phone.
[00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:33.420]   Yes.
[00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:34.980]   I will send it off today.
[00:24:34.980 --> 00:24:38.660]   I'll have to take my sim out but I will send it off and I'll wipe it and I'll send it off.
[00:24:38.660 --> 00:24:40.980]   Well there's no rush.
[00:24:40.980 --> 00:24:41.980]   Please do not.
[00:24:41.980 --> 00:24:43.940]   Well I know actually I was hoping because I had waited at...
[00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:47.900]   You mentioned you wanted a folding phone and I mentioned maybe I would send you mine.
[00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:50.300]   I was hoping you would have forgotten that by now.
[00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:51.300]   I bought it.
[00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:52.740]   No, apparently not.
[00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:54.860]   So I guess I will send it to you now.
[00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:55.860]   You don't have to send it.
[00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:56.860]   Please!
[00:24:56.860 --> 00:24:57.860]   No!
[00:24:57.860 --> 00:24:58.860]   You're so excited!
[00:24:58.860 --> 00:24:59.860]   No!
[00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:00.860]   No!
[00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:01.860]   We won!
[00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:02.860]   Run!
[00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:03.860]   Oh goodness.
[00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:05.660]   There's someone I think.
[00:25:05.660 --> 00:25:07.420]   There's like a physical person in the house.
[00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:08.580]   Do you want to go down and see what that is?
[00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:10.780]   There's a physical person in the house.
[00:25:10.780 --> 00:25:12.020]   Stacy bring us with you.
[00:25:12.020 --> 00:25:13.020]   That sounds dangerous.
[00:25:13.020 --> 00:25:15.740]   Leave your microphone on.
[00:25:15.740 --> 00:25:16.740]   Oh my God.
[00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:19.740]   They're in the house.
[00:25:19.740 --> 00:25:22.180]   Alright, I think we...
[00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:23.780]   Anyway, if you want to watch the whole event.
[00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:25.580]   Do you have our addresses?
[00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:29.180]   Like if I cocked out right now and went unconscious.
[00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:30.540]   Could you call the ambulance for me?
[00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:32.300]   That's actually a really good question.
[00:25:32.300 --> 00:25:33.300]   Do you have my addresses?
[00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:35.300]   Yes, Lisa has all of my addresses.
[00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:36.300]   Yes, we have our addresses.
[00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:37.300]   Yeah, but where's Lisa?
[00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:44.820]   I have to respond to find Lisa and then I have to say quick, Jeff Stein calls the ambulance.
[00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:48.380]   I think she's somewhere sitting in a mini cooper on fire.
[00:25:48.380 --> 00:25:49.380]   Yeah.
[00:25:49.380 --> 00:25:52.860]   Oh no, what's the latest with her mini cooper?
[00:25:52.860 --> 00:25:54.780]   So for those of you who haven't heard this long...
[00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:57.020]   I'm sorry to derail us, but I had to.
[00:25:57.020 --> 00:25:58.420]   Lisa was really excited.
[00:25:58.420 --> 00:25:59.420]   She ends it.
[00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:02.180]   And I feel bad because she's between us.
[00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:03.180]   She named it.
[00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:04.180]   She called it Pepper.
[00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:05.180]   Pepper, yeah.
[00:26:05.180 --> 00:26:06.180]   I remembered it.
[00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:07.180]   Yeah, right, Red.
[00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:08.980]   And she loved this car.
[00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:09.980]   800...
[00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:10.980]   There she is.
[00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:11.980]   Hi.
[00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:14.020]   We're not talking about you.
[00:26:14.020 --> 00:26:15.020]   800.
[00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:16.780]   We summoned her.
[00:26:16.780 --> 00:26:19.180]   She said I have their addresses.
[00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:20.180]   Oh, okay.
[00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:21.180]   Thank you, Lisa.
[00:26:21.180 --> 00:26:22.180]   You'll save my life.
[00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:26.100]   Lisa, could you put it on a card and give it to John so that we can call 911 if Jeff
[00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:27.100]   Kielzog.
[00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:28.100]   What?
[00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:32.140]   I don't know what maybe you think of this, but I thought of it.
[00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:33.140]   That's a really good guy.
[00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:34.140]   That's a good point.
[00:26:34.140 --> 00:26:35.140]   No, it actually is.
[00:26:35.140 --> 00:26:36.140]   Good point.
[00:26:36.140 --> 00:26:37.140]   Because you'd be frustrating.
[00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:38.140]   Oh, it'd be horrible.
[00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:40.140]   We'd see you dying on the floor and we'd go, "What can we do?
[00:26:40.140 --> 00:26:41.140]   What can we do?"
[00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:42.140]   She says she's going to do that.
[00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:46.900]   The best thing you should have actually is Jeff's wife's cell phone number.
[00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:47.900]   Right, contact address.
[00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:48.900]   But she might not be there, but...
[00:26:48.900 --> 00:26:49.900]   What if you can't find Lisa?
[00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:50.900]   Lisa can't find her.
[00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:51.900]   Lisa can't find her.
[00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:54.060]   That's how it all comes down to the wife.
[00:26:54.060 --> 00:26:55.500]   You can't find the wife.
[00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:56.500]   You did.
[00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:57.500]   You get rid of her.
[00:26:57.500 --> 00:26:58.500]   At last station, right now.
[00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:00.300]   And Jeff's lying on that beautiful oriental rug.
[00:27:00.300 --> 00:27:02.460]   He's dying, he's foaming at the mouth.
[00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:04.540]   And we're going, "I think he lives near Bedminster."
[00:27:04.540 --> 00:27:08.060]   Quick, come on, he's in New Jersey.
[00:27:08.060 --> 00:27:09.860]   I'm where, brothers, a tall guy.
[00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:11.820]   We wouldn't know what to do.
[00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:16.340]   And then imagine the people watching the show after the fact hours later.
[00:27:16.340 --> 00:27:17.820]   I traumatized.
[00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:18.820]   Traumatized.
[00:27:18.820 --> 00:27:19.820]   I know what to do.
[00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:22.820]   I would be like, "Okay, find Lisa.
[00:27:22.820 --> 00:27:23.820]   Call that ambulance."
[00:27:23.820 --> 00:27:24.820]   She's got the address.
[00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:25.820]   Yeah.
[00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:26.820]   Get his wife's address.
[00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:27.820]   Yeah.
[00:27:27.820 --> 00:27:29.900]   Stacey, this came up out of concern for you as you walked away.
[00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:33.700]   And Leo was saying, "What if there's somebody in your house?
[00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:34.700]   What do we do?"
[00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:35.700]   Yeah, turn on your eyes.
[00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:40.300]   That's exactly how I could serve for you that I brought this up.
[00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:41.300]   Don't we care?
[00:27:41.300 --> 00:27:42.300]   We care.
[00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:43.300]   We care.
[00:27:43.300 --> 00:27:44.300]   We all care way too much.
[00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:45.300]   Sometimes.
[00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:46.300]   You know what?
[00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:49.740]   There's someone who watches the show live who actually lives on Bainbridge Island.
[00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:51.380]   So they'd come running over.
[00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:52.820]   What about San Juan Island?
[00:27:52.820 --> 00:27:53.820]   Could we live there?
[00:27:53.820 --> 00:27:55.300]   Would that be a good place to live?
[00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:56.300]   Lisa looked at this point.
[00:27:56.300 --> 00:27:57.300]   It'd be lovely.
[00:27:57.300 --> 00:27:58.300]   Yeah.
[00:27:58.300 --> 00:27:59.300]   You know, do you need to get...
[00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:03.100]   No, no, because y'all said y'all wanted to access to medicine and stuff.
[00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:05.900]   The fairies are a little awkward.
[00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:07.700]   That's out.
[00:28:07.700 --> 00:28:13.180]   No, you know, it's funny because we are concerned about killing it over.
[00:28:13.180 --> 00:28:14.180]   Yes.
[00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:15.180]   Lisa, I had that conversation that morning.
[00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:17.540]   I said, "Well, if I die, I die."
[00:28:17.540 --> 00:28:19.780]   But it'd be nice to live somewhere.
[00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:21.380]   It's like just across from Wicley.
[00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:23.180]   It's like practically in Canada.
[00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:26.100]   Yeah, no, it's beautiful.
[00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:27.780]   It's kind of cold and wet.
[00:28:27.780 --> 00:28:28.780]   And you know what?
[00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:32.260]   You could actually get helicopter insurance or helicopter service.
[00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:34.100]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:35.100]   Yeah.
[00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:36.100]   Well, that's what I told her.
[00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:37.700]   I said, "Look, I'm not going to have a stroke or a heart attack because that's all
[00:28:37.700 --> 00:28:38.700]   it really matters.
[00:28:38.700 --> 00:28:41.860]   If you have a stroke or a heart attack, time to hospital is really, really important.
[00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:44.300]   But if you just broke your leg, big deal, right?
[00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:47.700]   I think there's probably urgent care on the island.
[00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:48.700]   That's gotta be.
[00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:50.300]   There's gotta be somebody to give you a mouth to mouth.
[00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:51.300]   There's gotta be.
[00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:52.300]   We're like, yeah.
[00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:53.300]   I just caught a husky.
[00:28:53.300 --> 00:29:00.300]   Bring him to husky's boys.
[00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:02.300]   I think he's dead.
[00:29:02.300 --> 00:29:04.300]   What are we talking about?
[00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:05.300]   Speaking of dead things.
[00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:06.300]   Speaking of dead things.
[00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:09.500]   I've got two dead things to talk about.
[00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:12.100]   Yeah, you're becoming an instigator, Ant.
[00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:14.300]   I am busting you.
[00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:19.020]   It used to be you tried to keep the show on purpose on track, right?
[00:29:19.020 --> 00:29:20.020]   I remember that, you two.
[00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:21.500]   It's time for the ad, things like that.
[00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:24.820]   Now it's like you just throw in fuel on the fire.
[00:29:24.820 --> 00:29:26.380]   Because now he's the social guy.
[00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:30.020]   So just like Facebook, he wants more conflict and attention.
[00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:31.020]   See?
[00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:32.980]   That's what doesn't do great content.
[00:29:32.980 --> 00:29:34.380]   It's all great content.
[00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:35.380]   Yeah.
[00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:36.380]   Go ahead.
[00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:38.180]   I talk about one of my two dead things or both of them.
[00:29:38.180 --> 00:29:40.340]   Please go ahead.
[00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:44.140]   My pixel book go dead.
[00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:45.620]   Didn't you just get that?
[00:29:45.620 --> 00:29:47.140]   Yes in November.
[00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:51.140]   And I would just walk out and suddenly screen went, no warning, no better.
[00:29:51.140 --> 00:29:52.140]   I think no nothing.
[00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:54.620]   Went through the whole McGilla.
[00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:58.180]   And then so I call, I go through the McGilla and McGilla and McGilla and McGilla.
[00:29:58.180 --> 00:30:00.420]   They say, yes, it is dead.
[00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:03.980]   But then in the old days, Google would say, we'll get to do an out to you and send it
[00:30:03.980 --> 00:30:05.660]   back and then we'll give you credit and be fine.
[00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:08.260]   No, no, no, no, no more supply chain.
[00:30:08.260 --> 00:30:13.180]   Now I had to wait three days for them to agree with their tech guy that it was dead.
[00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:14.860]   Like they should give him that authority.
[00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:20.060]   I had to be escalated to the undertaker who said, yes, that's officially dead.
[00:30:20.060 --> 00:30:21.900]   And then I finally got the RMA.
[00:30:21.900 --> 00:30:24.980]   And then today I got to send it back and I got to wait till they get it.
[00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:26.460]   But they say, yeah, looks dead to me.
[00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:27.460]   Look into you.
[00:30:27.460 --> 00:30:28.460]   Yeah, looks dead.
[00:30:28.460 --> 00:30:30.460]   And then they're going to send me the new one back.
[00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:31.940]   That's not the fourth time.
[00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:34.860]   That sounds like pretty standard operating procedures though.
[00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:37.060]   But Google wasn't like that.
[00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:38.060]   Yeah.
[00:30:38.060 --> 00:30:40.540]   The other thing I want to mention that's dead.
[00:30:40.540 --> 00:30:42.340]   I was going to bring this up.
[00:30:42.340 --> 00:30:47.260]   Entertainment Weekly, which you started, E.W., you were there at the beginning.
[00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:53.260]   The Meredith, which is the parent corporation, got sold, right?
[00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:59.460]   Timey when in the Meredith, the Meredith sold to Barry Diller's .dash, the content factory.
[00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:04.780]   And Barry Diller has announced six magazines.
[00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:06.260]   They are going to kill energy.
[00:31:06.260 --> 00:31:09.660]   Well, there'd be digital versions, but they're going to kill the print versions.
[00:31:09.660 --> 00:31:10.660]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:14.260]   That's like saying we live on in purgatory after I feel over in the show.
[00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:15.260]   Yeah.
[00:31:15.260 --> 00:31:16.260]   Yeah.
[00:31:16.260 --> 00:31:18.500]   And then it's like, it doesn't exist.
[00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:20.140]   In style, eating well.
[00:31:20.140 --> 00:31:21.980]   Which was in style was extremely successful.
[00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:22.980]   Loved in style.
[00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:24.940]   Well, these were all successful, I think.
[00:31:24.940 --> 00:31:25.940]   Oh, yeah.
[00:31:25.940 --> 00:31:32.780]   Health, parents, and people on Español, I guess people will continue.
[00:31:32.780 --> 00:31:34.420]   Dot dash Meredith.
[00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:35.580]   That's the name of the company.
[00:31:35.580 --> 00:31:36.580]   Dot dash Meredith.
[00:31:36.580 --> 00:31:37.580]   That's terrible.
[00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:38.580]   That's terrible.
[00:31:38.580 --> 00:31:39.580]   That's where he's been.
[00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:40.580]   That's wrong.
[00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:43.820]   He's going to put the 200 job losses.
[00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:45.620]   Sorry.
[00:31:45.620 --> 00:31:51.020]   Although that's only 5% of dot dash Meredith's total staff, all six magazines would have
[00:31:51.020 --> 00:31:53.860]   their final issue in April.
[00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:54.860]   E.W.
[00:31:54.860 --> 00:31:56.540]   It was a great magazine.
[00:31:56.540 --> 00:31:58.660]   And I didn't know you at the time.
[00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:01.660]   I subscribed to that when it first started.
[00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:02.660]   I used it.
[00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:06.060]   Well, at the time I was a DJ and I needed celebrity tidbits and it was a great source
[00:32:06.060 --> 00:32:07.060]   for that.
[00:32:07.060 --> 00:32:10.260]   If you, so I so happens, I'm writing a project right now.
[00:32:10.260 --> 00:32:15.340]   I'll talk about it another time, but on magazines and I was writing the chapter on the
[00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:18.700]   launch, the first time I was telling the story of the launch of E.W. and then they announced
[00:32:18.700 --> 00:32:19.700]   what came out.
[00:32:19.700 --> 00:32:25.380]   If you go to my Twitter feed, you will see some of the things from my files, including
[00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:28.500]   my proposal for it originally.
[00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:33.140]   The junk mail and fake covers we had to make, the cover that Cosby used to send me a junk
[00:32:33.140 --> 00:32:41.220]   mail and finally a top editor of all of Time Make who said, "Just as we'd become an entertainment
[00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:44.780]   company with Warner Brothers, that we were being too mean to Hollywood."
[00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:48.460]   He calculated the grade point average of our reviews in the magazine.
[00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:49.460]   Wow.
[00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:50.460]   It was hell.
[00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:52.020]   I walked out soon thereafter.
[00:32:52.020 --> 00:32:53.860]   Thank you for my little morning.
[00:32:53.860 --> 00:32:57.980]   So this is the question I guess, you know, this leads to.
[00:32:57.980 --> 00:33:01.380]   We're seeing this digital transformation everywhere.
[00:33:01.380 --> 00:33:02.380]   See it.
[00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:03.380]   Really?
[00:33:03.380 --> 00:33:04.380]   Really?
[00:33:04.380 --> 00:33:05.380]   He says.
[00:33:05.380 --> 00:33:06.380]   I know.
[00:33:06.380 --> 00:33:07.380]   It seems like obvious, doesn't it?
[00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:12.940]   A little bit of a jiu an observation from your host.
[00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:14.940]   See it at plus is coming.
[00:33:14.940 --> 00:33:16.780]   Did you know us?
[00:33:16.780 --> 00:33:17.780]   That's me.
[00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:21.460]   CNN plus going streaming.
[00:33:21.460 --> 00:33:24.980]   CBS is already streaming.
[00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:30.380]   Digital seems to, is it, should we ring the death now for print?
[00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:35.460]   And I guess the secondary question, did Barry Diller blow it when he paid $2.7 billion
[00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:38.060]   for Meredith less than a year ago?
[00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:39.060]   Yes.
[00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:48.420]   As long as I still see the press Democrat out here in Sonoma County, I guess print is
[00:33:48.420 --> 00:33:51.500]   still fine because somebody is still paying for that stuff.
[00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:56.300]   Ironically, I have tried desperately to find a way not to get the print version in the
[00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:57.300]   New York Times.
[00:33:57.300 --> 00:34:01.980]   I want all the digital stuff, but I keep getting the big old Sunday times because I can't figure
[00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:06.260]   out any other way to get the whole Macgilla.
[00:34:06.260 --> 00:34:10.300]   I get the New York Times without a print paper.
[00:34:10.300 --> 00:34:13.180]   Do you get the cross words cooking?
[00:34:13.180 --> 00:34:15.020]   World cooking.
[00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:16.020]   You get all that stuff.
[00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:17.020]   How do you get rid of the time?
[00:34:17.020 --> 00:34:18.220]   Do I need?
[00:34:18.220 --> 00:34:19.220]   I don't want the paper.
[00:34:19.220 --> 00:34:21.060]   I just signed up for a digital subscription.
[00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:23.380]   Maybe I'm just too stupid to do it, but I probably have to follow.
[00:34:23.380 --> 00:34:24.380]   I'm like, I don't know.
[00:34:24.380 --> 00:34:25.380]   It wasn't hard.
[00:34:25.380 --> 00:34:27.500]   Oh, you know what it is?
[00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:31.780]   Maybe they asked for my birth date and they didn't even try to send me.
[00:34:31.780 --> 00:34:37.340]   You, my friend, you, remember Skylab.
[00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:40.700]   You, everybody who doesn't remember Skylab gets it all together.
[00:34:40.700 --> 00:34:41.700]   Yes.
[00:34:41.700 --> 00:34:42.700]   Exactly.
[00:34:42.700 --> 00:34:43.700]   Here's the last one.
[00:34:43.700 --> 00:34:44.700]   Well played.
[00:34:44.700 --> 00:34:47.460]   Here's these GPAs from your notebook.
[00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:48.460]   Good Lord.
[00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:50.100]   What an ass.
[00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:56.940]   Although, you'll be getting your report card a little later today.
[00:34:56.940 --> 00:34:57.940]   What's out there?
[00:34:57.940 --> 00:34:58.940]   Worth.
[00:34:58.940 --> 00:34:59.940]   No, I forget.
[00:34:59.940 --> 00:35:00.940]   I can't read.
[00:35:00.940 --> 00:35:08.980]   Oh, the writing here, what's out there makes you wonder why so many folks are still going
[00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:10.660]   to the movies.
[00:35:10.660 --> 00:35:15.220]   His argument was our mark critic gave pretty women a negative review.
[00:35:15.220 --> 00:35:17.420]   Oh, I see the GPA is the bad grades.
[00:35:17.420 --> 00:35:18.500]   It's the bad grades.
[00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:22.020]   So we gave, we gave six below C minus.
[00:35:22.020 --> 00:35:23.260]   He actually talked to this.
[00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:27.500]   And so he's saying, hey, if all these movies are so bad, why are people still going to
[00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:28.500]   them?
[00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:29.500]   Right.
[00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:32.820]   And to like what the public likes and not be a critic, which was against the whole idea
[00:35:32.820 --> 00:35:33.820]   of the magazine.
[00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:34.820]   Right.
[00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:36.820]   And critics in general.
[00:35:36.820 --> 00:35:38.820]   I mean, yeah.
[00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:41.460]   So you say, you, you tweet it.
[00:35:41.460 --> 00:35:45.860]   So I don't know how serious it is.
[00:35:45.860 --> 00:35:47.980]   Is this an alien the coffin for print?
[00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:50.140]   I mean, is this just one more nail in the other one?
[00:35:50.140 --> 00:35:51.140]   Yeah.
[00:35:51.140 --> 00:35:52.140]   Yeah.
[00:35:52.140 --> 00:35:53.700]   The coffin is heavy with lead.
[00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:55.740]   And yet I went to a book store the other day.
[00:35:55.740 --> 00:36:00.660]   And there's a whole four or five shelves of print magazines.
[00:36:00.660 --> 00:36:02.460]   Oh, there's more titles than ever.
[00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:05.860]   Things like there's a new pickleball magazine, right?
[00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:07.860]   That kind of thing.
[00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:09.860]   But there is.
[00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:12.500]   I can't get it from Andrew for Valentine's Day.
[00:36:12.500 --> 00:36:14.700]   Oh, there you go.
[00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:17.460]   By the way, are you going to shop while we're on the show here?
[00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:19.300]   Stacey, are you going to go do that?
[00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:20.300]   I'll hold you up.
[00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:21.300]   I'm writing it.
[00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:25.580]   I bought that cocktail mixer that you recommended for Lisa's birthday.
[00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:26.580]   Good.
[00:36:26.580 --> 00:36:27.580]   It's not good.
[00:36:27.580 --> 00:36:28.580]   It's not good.
[00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:29.580]   Shh, don't tell her.
[00:36:29.580 --> 00:36:30.580]   What's wrong with it?
[00:36:30.580 --> 00:36:31.580]   You told me to buy it.
[00:36:31.580 --> 00:36:34.580]   So what did you turn off the studio speakers?
[00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:36.420]   I hadn't tried it yet.
[00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:37.420]   What's does it leak?
[00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:40.140]   The top, the very top bit in mine leaks.
[00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:44.060]   But I sent them an email and they said they were figuring it out because I was like, oh,
[00:36:44.060 --> 00:36:45.060]   they even know about it.
[00:36:45.060 --> 00:36:48.460]   Oh, that's just like, is there like maybe a gasket missing?
[00:36:48.460 --> 00:36:49.460]   Because mine leaks.
[00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:51.700]   And I think they're going to probably try to send me a new one.
[00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:53.660]   Mine came with a little baggie of extra gaskets.
[00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:54.660]   So maybe that's why.
[00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:55.660]   I did too.
[00:36:55.660 --> 00:36:56.660]   Oh, no.
[00:36:56.660 --> 00:37:00.140]   But that's why, but it doesn't come with a top gasket.
[00:37:00.140 --> 00:37:06.020]   So yeah, I just, like, because when I bought it, I didn't try it yet because it was a gift.
[00:37:06.020 --> 00:37:08.900]   But having now tried it, I can't remember.
[00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:12.180]   Of course, I actually bought it on that show that you mentioned.
[00:37:12.180 --> 00:37:13.180]   I said, oh, I know.
[00:37:13.180 --> 00:37:14.180]   And I told you not to.
[00:37:14.180 --> 00:37:16.740]   I said, wait, no, I haven't tried it.
[00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:19.700]   It was a Kickstarter or something, right?
[00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:22.020]   I, one time ago was.
[00:37:22.020 --> 00:37:23.980]   There's two pickleblop magazines, Stacy.
[00:37:23.980 --> 00:37:25.420]   There's two pickleblop magazines.
[00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:27.140]   You get to choose, you get to get them both.
[00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:28.140]   Can't both.
[00:37:28.140 --> 00:37:29.140]   Yeah.
[00:37:29.140 --> 00:37:30.140]   You're going to subscribe to a pickleball magazine.
[00:37:30.140 --> 00:37:32.140]   Might as well get both of them.
[00:37:32.140 --> 00:37:33.140]   Yeah.
[00:37:33.140 --> 00:37:35.340]   So, because you know, you might miss some otherwise.
[00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:41.340]   Other than Miss Stacy getting two pickleball magazines, who else is actually getting print?
[00:37:41.340 --> 00:37:42.340]   Well, yeah.
[00:37:42.340 --> 00:37:45.060]   Let me explain this, Jeff, because you said there's more titles than ever before.
[00:37:45.060 --> 00:37:47.420]   What does more of this niche stuff they come and go?
[00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:48.420]   You know what?
[00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:49.420]   Okay.
[00:37:49.420 --> 00:37:50.420]   Here's a quiz.
[00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:53.500]   What are the top two magazines in circulation in the United States now?
[00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:55.500]   They come from the same place.
[00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:56.500]   Nope.
[00:37:56.500 --> 00:37:57.500]   ARP magazine.
[00:37:57.500 --> 00:37:58.500]   Yes.
[00:37:58.500 --> 00:37:59.500]   Oh, yeah.
[00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:00.500]   Oh, yeah.
[00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:03.460]   And you know what the number four top magazine in the country is?
[00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:05.860]   So, better homes and gardens is number three.
[00:38:05.860 --> 00:38:07.380]   What I guess what number four is?
[00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:08.380]   What?
[00:38:08.380 --> 00:38:09.380]   Costco.
[00:38:09.380 --> 00:38:10.380]   Oh my God.
[00:38:10.380 --> 00:38:13.020]   But that's just because they sent it to everybody, right?
[00:38:13.020 --> 00:38:14.020]   Yeah.
[00:38:14.020 --> 00:38:15.020]   You don't subscribe to it.
[00:38:15.020 --> 00:38:16.020]   Yeah.
[00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:17.020]   Right.
[00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:18.020]   But it has more circulation than now.
[00:38:18.020 --> 00:38:19.020]   I feel kind of bad.
[00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:21.020]   I blew off the WARP magazine.
[00:38:21.020 --> 00:38:24.300]   You could have been part of the mass.
[00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:26.700]   Well, I remember, I did I tell you this story?
[00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:31.500]   They asked me to write stuff for them and then I got very confusing instructions from
[00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:35.540]   two different editors, one who said, "smarting it up," and one who said, "dumb it down."
[00:38:35.540 --> 00:38:36.540]   Oh.
[00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:37.540]   And I thought that was a good one.
[00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:39.540]   I mean, your copy was perfect.
[00:38:39.540 --> 00:38:40.540]   Oh, man.
[00:38:40.540 --> 00:38:43.380]   23.6 million readers.
[00:38:43.380 --> 00:38:45.140]   No, no, wow.
[00:38:45.140 --> 00:38:46.140]   That's subscribers.
[00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:47.140]   36 million readers.
[00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:49.380]   But I get, you know what?
[00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:51.580]   That's a little, I get it because I'm in it.
[00:38:51.580 --> 00:38:54.220]   I'll read it.
[00:38:54.220 --> 00:38:55.220]   So I don't know.
[00:38:55.220 --> 00:38:58.620]   I think a lot of people probably get it because if you join WARP, you'll never get
[00:38:58.620 --> 00:39:00.420]   it because it'll be drawn.
[00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:01.420]   Yeah.
[00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:02.420]   I'm Stacy's.
[00:39:02.420 --> 00:39:03.420]   Oh, that's right.
[00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:05.420]   No, I think how old do you have to be for ARP?
[00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:06.420]   50.
[00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:07.420]   50 plus, yeah.
[00:39:07.420 --> 00:39:08.420]   Oh, okay.
[00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:09.420]   It'll be a little bit.
[00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:12.500]   I mean, at one time, there was a hole in this, at least for me, there was a nostalgia around
[00:39:12.500 --> 00:39:18.700]   print media, you know, something would happen like, what's your favorite magazine?
[00:39:18.700 --> 00:39:19.700]   What do you miss, Ant?
[00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:21.500]   Is there a magazine you wish you could get?
[00:39:21.500 --> 00:39:26.460]   I used to love surprise, surprise ESPN's magazine.
[00:39:26.460 --> 00:39:27.460]   Not Sports Illustrated.
[00:39:27.460 --> 00:39:28.780]   It was better.
[00:39:28.780 --> 00:39:32.540]   I thought they were better than Sports Illustrated back in the day.
[00:39:32.540 --> 00:39:33.540]   Did it die?
[00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:34.540]   Of course, then.
[00:39:34.540 --> 00:39:36.460]   Yeah, it went away.
[00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:38.100]   But then there was also newspapers.
[00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:41.700]   I used to enjoy picking up newspapers on certain events.
[00:39:41.700 --> 00:39:48.860]   You know, I still have the newspaper from when Dale Earnhardt was killed in the race, you
[00:39:48.860 --> 00:39:50.700]   know, stuff like that.
[00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:52.820]   It was sentimental to me.
[00:39:52.820 --> 00:39:58.180]   But now I think people don't really care about getting things like that just from a sentimental
[00:39:58.180 --> 00:39:59.180]   value.
[00:39:59.180 --> 00:40:00.180]   I don't know.
[00:40:00.180 --> 00:40:01.580]   What do you miss, Stacy?
[00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:03.420]   Is there a magazine that you?
[00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:08.100]   I don't miss it because I still subscribe to it, but I subscribe to the New Yorker.
[00:40:08.100 --> 00:40:09.100]   Mm.
[00:40:09.100 --> 00:40:10.100]   But I don't get the--
[00:40:10.100 --> 00:40:12.220]   I don't subscribe, but I'll get the print version.
[00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:13.220]   It's a great magazine.
[00:40:13.220 --> 00:40:16.420]   I get the print version because I need a break from--
[00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:17.420]   Right.
[00:40:17.420 --> 00:40:22.460]   I feel like I can't read the New Yorker in print because it requires so much depth.
[00:40:22.460 --> 00:40:23.460]   Yeah.
[00:40:23.460 --> 00:40:24.460]   Yeah.
[00:40:24.460 --> 00:40:27.620]   But their app is actually pretty good because they add all this extra stuff.
[00:40:27.620 --> 00:40:28.620]   It's excellent.
[00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:29.620]   And in fact--
[00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:30.620]   So it's kind of tough.
[00:40:30.620 --> 00:40:32.540]   That's why I stopped getting the print magazine because it made me feel guilty that I didn't
[00:40:32.540 --> 00:40:33.700]   get to it.
[00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:36.220]   So with a digital, I'd add a site out of mine.
[00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:39.500]   But I also subscribed to The Atlantic.
[00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:40.500]   What do you miss?
[00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:41.500]   I used to get it.
[00:40:41.500 --> 00:40:49.180]   I missed-- you remember heavy metal?
[00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:51.420]   You don't remember heavy metal?
[00:40:51.420 --> 00:40:52.660]   You know what I'm talking about?
[00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:55.180]   I know our chat room remembers heavy metal.
[00:40:55.180 --> 00:40:56.700]   John remembers heavy metal.
[00:40:56.700 --> 00:41:01.780]   It was kind of like a comic magazine, but it had incredible--
[00:41:01.780 --> 00:41:02.780]   Wow.
[00:41:02.780 --> 00:41:07.100]   --worldly beautiful-- they call it the Adult Illustrated Fantasy magazine.
[00:41:07.100 --> 00:41:08.100]   But wasn't it--
[00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:09.100]   Okay, so I like it.
[00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:12.100]   It was adult like-- well, it was a little adult, apparently.
[00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:13.100]   I was just--
[00:41:13.100 --> 00:41:14.100]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:15.100]   That's so--
[00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:18.100]   I was like, I'm looking at this and I'm like, hey.
[00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:20.780]   No, it was a really great magazine.
[00:41:20.780 --> 00:41:22.620]   I actually really miss it.
[00:41:22.620 --> 00:41:23.620]   Incredible art.
[00:41:23.620 --> 00:41:24.820]   I miss my fantasy.
[00:41:24.820 --> 00:41:27.100]   I had a science fiction--
[00:41:27.100 --> 00:41:29.460]   I don't remember which science fiction story.
[00:41:29.460 --> 00:41:30.460]   It was a magazine.
[00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:31.460]   Was it a pulp?
[00:41:31.460 --> 00:41:32.460]   Well done.
[00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:35.220]   It wasn't a pulp because it was a full-size magazine size.
[00:41:35.220 --> 00:41:36.220]   Yeah.
[00:41:36.220 --> 00:41:39.020]   But it had the beautiful art in there plus the stories.
[00:41:39.020 --> 00:41:40.020]   Yeah, this was kind of like that.
[00:41:40.020 --> 00:41:41.380]   You know what I still get?
[00:41:41.380 --> 00:41:43.380]   Which is not print.
[00:41:43.380 --> 00:41:44.460]   I should show it to you.
[00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:45.620]   So I get McSweeney's.
[00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:48.460]   Oh, that's a-- I get McSweeney's too.
[00:41:48.460 --> 00:41:49.460]   That's great.
[00:41:49.460 --> 00:41:50.460]   Do you have the audio issue?
[00:41:50.460 --> 00:41:51.460]   Did you love that?
[00:41:51.460 --> 00:41:52.460]   Were you not so--
[00:41:52.460 --> 00:41:53.460]   I haven't heard the audio issue.
[00:41:53.460 --> 00:41:54.460]   Oh.
[00:41:54.460 --> 00:41:55.460]   I will get it.
[00:41:55.460 --> 00:41:57.660]   Okay, I'm going to just have to go get it at some point in time and show you all because
[00:41:57.660 --> 00:41:59.580]   they did really neat things.
[00:41:59.580 --> 00:42:02.300]   They have like, okay, I'm not going to--
[00:42:02.300 --> 00:42:05.380]   That was-- that was started by Dave Eggers.
[00:42:05.380 --> 00:42:09.620]   And it's kind of a literary magazine, but they have some very funny stuff.
[00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:10.620]   Oh, my God.
[00:42:10.620 --> 00:42:11.620]   You can go get it.
[00:42:11.620 --> 00:42:13.740]   You just have to let us know your home address is on the way.
[00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:14.740]   Yeah.
[00:42:14.740 --> 00:42:16.500]   Up the-- the ambulance is calling.
[00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:17.500]   We just want to know.
[00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:18.500]   Wait a minute.
[00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:19.500]   Are you okay?
[00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:20.500]   You're still alive.
[00:42:20.500 --> 00:42:21.500]   Jeff Jarvis.
[00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:23.500]   Is your ringtone a ring?
[00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:25.060]   Well, it's better.
[00:42:25.060 --> 00:42:26.060]   Yeah, it's-- yeah.
[00:42:26.060 --> 00:42:27.060]   Okay.
[00:42:27.060 --> 00:42:28.060]   Just checking.
[00:42:28.060 --> 00:42:29.060]   Yeah.
[00:42:29.060 --> 00:42:30.060]   Because I'm an old friend.
[00:42:30.060 --> 00:42:31.660]   Or is that like a bacolate handset with the big--
[00:42:31.660 --> 00:42:33.660]   It's the Vail South one.
[00:42:33.660 --> 00:42:34.660]   Give me a copy.
[00:42:34.660 --> 00:42:36.660]   Stacey, you got a problem with that?
[00:42:36.660 --> 00:42:37.660]   Suddenly there will be--
[00:42:37.660 --> 00:42:38.660]   Get the whole ring.
[00:42:38.660 --> 00:42:40.100]   So operator to your operator.
[00:42:40.100 --> 00:42:43.860]   Do you get the McSweeney's paper magazine?
[00:42:43.860 --> 00:42:45.340]   Is that what you're talking about?
[00:42:45.340 --> 00:42:46.340]   Here's-- okay.
[00:42:46.340 --> 00:42:48.940]   So I'm do the internet tendency deal, you know?
[00:42:48.940 --> 00:42:52.380]   This is the internet-- this is McSweeney's 60.
[00:42:52.380 --> 00:42:54.460]   So it's a big old story magazine.
[00:42:54.460 --> 00:42:55.460]   Oh, look at that.
[00:42:55.460 --> 00:42:56.460]   Oh, that's nice.
[00:42:56.460 --> 00:43:00.180]   And then they've got photo essays and they're apparently not hitting any of their photo
[00:43:00.180 --> 00:43:01.180]   essays.
[00:43:01.180 --> 00:43:02.180]   Okay.
[00:43:02.180 --> 00:43:03.180]   Y'all keep talking about that.
[00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:04.180]   The print.
[00:43:04.180 --> 00:43:05.780]   No, but it's gorgeous.
[00:43:05.780 --> 00:43:15.340]   Well, but that's what people have said, is that these kinds of, dare I say, twee--
[00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:17.940]   Items will become luxury items.
[00:43:17.940 --> 00:43:18.940]   Oh, yes.
[00:43:18.940 --> 00:43:19.940]   Absolutely.
[00:43:19.940 --> 00:43:23.420]   They're commonplace, but the newspaper, the magazine's-- that's a luxury magazine.
[00:43:23.420 --> 00:43:24.420]   Look at it, it's gorgeous.
[00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:25.420]   Yeah.
[00:43:25.420 --> 00:43:26.420]   Probably very expensive.
[00:43:26.420 --> 00:43:27.420]   Okay.
[00:43:27.420 --> 00:43:28.420]   I'm coming back with the other one.
[00:43:28.420 --> 00:43:29.420]   I have to show you.
[00:43:29.420 --> 00:43:30.420]   Okay.
[00:43:30.420 --> 00:43:31.420]   Since we're talking about this.
[00:43:31.420 --> 00:43:32.420]   Meanwhile, 30 seconds we're coming up.
[00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:38.900]   From McSweeney's February edition, the Dungeon and Dragons Monster Manual entry for your
[00:43:38.900 --> 00:43:39.900]   child.
[00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:52.220]   If your child were a character in Dungeons and Dragons, would it be?
[00:43:52.220 --> 00:43:55.220]   That's the kind of trenchant--
[00:43:55.220 --> 00:43:56.220]   Or best.
[00:43:56.220 --> 00:43:57.220]   --writing I love.
[00:43:57.220 --> 00:43:58.540]   Well, you know what I miss then?
[00:43:58.540 --> 00:43:59.540]   Spy.
[00:43:59.540 --> 00:44:00.540]   Spy, same thing.
[00:44:00.540 --> 00:44:01.540]   This is like--
[00:44:01.540 --> 00:44:05.940]   This is what your favorite sad dad band says about you.
[00:44:05.940 --> 00:44:08.020]   Oh, McSweeney, yeah.
[00:44:08.020 --> 00:44:09.020]   These are fun.
[00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:10.020]   We'll go.
[00:44:10.020 --> 00:44:12.300]   So those are their comedy ones.
[00:44:12.300 --> 00:44:13.300]   But, okay.
[00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:14.300]   That's very funny.
[00:44:14.300 --> 00:44:15.300]   There's the audio issue.
[00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:16.300]   Oh, look at that.
[00:44:16.300 --> 00:44:17.300]   The guide--
[00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:18.380]   Is it too late to subscribe to it?
[00:44:18.380 --> 00:44:19.380]   That's awesome.
[00:44:19.380 --> 00:44:20.380]   Is it because--
[00:44:20.380 --> 00:44:21.380]   Let me show you.
[00:44:21.380 --> 00:44:24.460]   I'm going to show you what I was in here.
[00:44:24.460 --> 00:44:25.460]   So--
[00:44:25.460 --> 00:44:26.460]   You can buy it.
[00:44:26.460 --> 00:44:27.940]   I'm going to get a used car.
[00:44:27.940 --> 00:44:28.940]   All right.
[00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:30.940]   It comes with the warning on top of the thing.
[00:44:30.940 --> 00:44:33.300]   So you have to use this with audio.
[00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:36.460]   But it has things like this keychain.
[00:44:36.460 --> 00:44:41.340]   If you call this number, there are little stories that you press a button on your phone
[00:44:41.340 --> 00:44:42.340]   and your red--
[00:44:42.340 --> 00:44:43.340]   So tweet.
[00:44:43.340 --> 00:44:46.140]   Because it's $85 by the way.
[00:44:46.140 --> 00:44:47.140]   Oh, yeah.
[00:44:47.140 --> 00:44:48.140]   My subscription--
[00:44:48.140 --> 00:44:49.140]   Wow.
[00:44:49.140 --> 00:44:50.140]   Well, this subscription is--
[00:44:50.140 --> 00:44:51.780]   Oh, you got Nick Hornby in here, though.
[00:44:51.780 --> 00:44:52.780]   I love Nick Hornby.
[00:44:52.780 --> 00:44:54.460]   Nick, I like these songs.
[00:44:54.460 --> 00:44:57.140]   Yeah, my annual subscription is $100.
[00:44:57.140 --> 00:45:02.460]   But this, like, you play on your smartphone and you roll it through as the stories play.
[00:45:02.460 --> 00:45:06.260]   So this is a perfect, perfect example of how print will survive.
[00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:07.260]   Is it stuff like this?
[00:45:07.260 --> 00:45:08.260]   Yeah.
[00:45:08.260 --> 00:45:09.260]   But there's also stories.
[00:45:09.260 --> 00:45:10.260]   Small, you know, print.
[00:45:10.260 --> 00:45:11.260]   Yeah, small, small, small, small, small--
[00:45:11.260 --> 00:45:12.260]   Yeah, small, small, small, small, small, small--
[00:45:12.260 --> 00:45:16.380]   But like you said, it seems like it's more of a premium experience, but they premium priced
[00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:17.380]   it.
[00:45:17.380 --> 00:45:18.380]   I helped them survive.
[00:45:18.380 --> 00:45:19.380]   Oh, it's so fun.
[00:45:19.380 --> 00:45:20.380]   When it comes, you're just like--
[00:45:20.380 --> 00:45:21.380]   Holy--
[00:45:21.380 --> 00:45:22.380]   I almost--
[00:45:22.380 --> 00:45:23.380]   Curse it.
[00:45:23.380 --> 00:45:24.380]   Holy cow, what did Nick Sweeney send me?
[00:45:24.380 --> 00:45:25.380]   I mean, look at this.
[00:45:25.380 --> 00:45:28.220]   This is like a travel poster.
[00:45:28.220 --> 00:45:29.220]   And if you--
[00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:31.580]   Actually, you can get just the audio for $32.
[00:45:31.580 --> 00:45:32.860]   So that's not bad.
[00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:38.100]   That is really-- look at the energy and the creativity and the talent that goes into something
[00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:39.100]   like that.
[00:45:39.100 --> 00:45:40.100]   It's amazing.
[00:45:40.100 --> 00:45:41.100]   It's awesome.
[00:45:41.100 --> 00:45:42.100]   Yeah, it's--
[00:45:42.100 --> 00:45:43.260]   I just get so--
[00:45:43.260 --> 00:45:48.300]   So what happened when print got-- watch out, history coming-- when print got mechanized?
[00:45:48.300 --> 00:45:51.100]   Because I don't think Gutenberg ever thought of something like this.
[00:45:51.100 --> 00:45:52.100]   That's pretty--
[00:45:52.100 --> 00:45:53.100]   No, no, you did.
[00:45:53.100 --> 00:45:54.100]   But when the line of time came along, print got mechanized.
[00:45:54.100 --> 00:45:58.780]   What you saw at the same time, like in the arts and craft movement, you saw a movement
[00:45:58.780 --> 00:46:00.020]   toward fine print.
[00:46:00.020 --> 00:46:04.100]   And people who were still doing hand print magazines with beautiful fonts that they would
[00:46:04.100 --> 00:46:08.460]   cut themselves crazy, really eccentric people doing it.
[00:46:08.460 --> 00:46:10.100]   And so the same thing is happening now.
[00:46:10.100 --> 00:46:13.940]   As the medium dies, you raise the art level of what's left.
[00:46:13.940 --> 00:46:14.940]   Yeah.
[00:46:14.940 --> 00:46:18.140]   Not necessarily a bad tendency.
[00:46:18.140 --> 00:46:23.140]   And so what it means is that magazines like Entertainment Weekly, which are really for
[00:46:23.140 --> 00:46:27.700]   the people, the masses, just they go away.
[00:46:27.700 --> 00:46:28.860]   The masses have gone somewhere else.
[00:46:28.860 --> 00:46:33.380]   Oh, we have Time Magazine is unnecessary with the web.
[00:46:33.380 --> 00:46:35.940]   Newsweek is a horrible husk of its former self.
[00:46:35.940 --> 00:46:36.940]   Yeah.
[00:46:36.940 --> 00:46:40.580]   When you work at those places, they treat the web like poop.
[00:46:40.580 --> 00:46:41.580]   Yep.
[00:46:41.580 --> 00:46:42.580]   Yep.
[00:46:42.580 --> 00:46:43.580]   Exactly.
[00:46:43.580 --> 00:46:47.340]   Well, that's the story of this time, at least as well as the web.
[00:46:47.340 --> 00:46:52.580]   I mean, when we were doing the site on MSNBC, the website and the TV site hated each other.
[00:46:52.580 --> 00:46:56.860]   It was like, you know, oil and water because it's like, right?
[00:46:56.860 --> 00:46:57.860]   I can't eat these.
[00:46:57.860 --> 00:46:59.940]   The old media guys thought that the new media guys were killing them.
[00:46:59.940 --> 00:47:00.940]   Oh, well, yeah.
[00:47:00.940 --> 00:47:02.580]   Yeah, you're ruining everything for us.
[00:47:02.580 --> 00:47:04.900]   Just shush and go away and it'll be okay.
[00:47:04.900 --> 00:47:06.860]   So I'm writing a book about magazines.
[00:47:06.860 --> 00:47:07.860]   Are you?
[00:47:07.860 --> 00:47:08.860]   Not a contract.
[00:47:08.860 --> 00:47:09.860]   Yeah.
[00:47:09.860 --> 00:47:10.860]   Awesome.
[00:47:10.860 --> 00:47:11.860]   Oh, nice.
[00:47:11.860 --> 00:47:12.860]   Congrats.
[00:47:12.860 --> 00:47:14.860]   That is going to be a fascinating read.
[00:47:14.860 --> 00:47:15.860]   I can't wait to read it.
[00:47:15.860 --> 00:47:19.260]   Well, that was my journalist major Jeff.
[00:47:19.260 --> 00:47:20.260]   What?
[00:47:20.260 --> 00:47:24.340]   I said that was my journalism major Jeff that I went into magazine.
[00:47:24.340 --> 00:47:25.340]   Oh, that's huge.
[00:47:25.340 --> 00:47:26.340]   Yeah.
[00:47:26.340 --> 00:47:29.740]   I know when we used to pick the media and that kind of quaint.
[00:47:29.740 --> 00:47:31.380]   I'm a magazine person.
[00:47:31.380 --> 00:47:32.740]   I don't I don't write for newsprint.
[00:47:32.740 --> 00:47:34.380]   I write for slick paper.
[00:47:34.380 --> 00:47:35.380]   Exactly.
[00:47:35.380 --> 00:47:38.020]   I did the ASME internship and everything.
[00:47:38.020 --> 00:47:40.860]   I was like feature writing for the win.
[00:47:40.860 --> 00:47:41.860]   Yeah.
[00:47:41.860 --> 00:47:45.060]   I don't know why the paper is slick.
[00:47:45.060 --> 00:47:46.580]   Why?
[00:47:46.580 --> 00:47:51.100]   Because the ink doesn't absorb in as much and it doesn't spread and so you can have more
[00:47:51.100 --> 00:47:52.100]   bi-
[00:47:52.100 --> 00:47:53.100]   CRISPR and prettier.
[00:47:53.100 --> 00:47:54.100]   Yeah.
[00:47:54.100 --> 00:47:56.500]   I thought it was to hold the drool.
[00:47:56.500 --> 00:48:00.300]   Well, that killed the conversation.
[00:48:00.300 --> 00:48:02.300]   Were you going to talk about Playboy?
[00:48:02.300 --> 00:48:03.300]   Right away.
[00:48:03.300 --> 00:48:04.820]   I just whoop.
[00:48:04.820 --> 00:48:09.300]   But actually feature writing dying is a symptom of a lot.
[00:48:09.300 --> 00:48:11.740]   I mean, there are still by the way, there's still great feature writing.
[00:48:11.740 --> 00:48:12.940]   That's what New Yorker does is what the New Yorker does.
[00:48:12.940 --> 00:48:13.940]   But for a few.
[00:48:13.940 --> 00:48:14.940]   For it.
[00:48:14.940 --> 00:48:20.380]   But therefore, and I think far because there are far fewer readers and I really do wonder
[00:48:20.380 --> 00:48:23.980]   if people are going to read long form anything in the years to come.
[00:48:23.980 --> 00:48:28.220]   I can't imagine my kids spending time with a 5,000 word article.
[00:48:28.220 --> 00:48:30.380]   I think they'll have long form podcasts.
[00:48:30.380 --> 00:48:31.380]   They have long form.
[00:48:31.380 --> 00:48:33.020]   Well, God knows we do those.
[00:48:33.020 --> 00:48:34.020]   Yeah.
[00:48:34.020 --> 00:48:36.020]   I see the equivalent.
[00:48:36.020 --> 00:48:37.020]   Those aren't even well researched.
[00:48:37.020 --> 00:48:38.020]   I mean, my goodness.
[00:48:38.020 --> 00:48:40.020]   Are the new harpers monthly.
[00:48:40.020 --> 00:48:46.300]   The new ones you know, Stacey, that's really where the feature was feature rating was going.
[00:48:46.300 --> 00:48:49.300]   And listen, you wouldn't believe this, folks, but this show is scripted.
[00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:50.300]   We're all reading this.
[00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:51.300]   Oh, God.
[00:48:51.300 --> 00:48:52.300]   Yes.
[00:48:52.300 --> 00:48:53.780]   We spent a lot of work going in to write this show.
[00:48:53.780 --> 00:48:55.780]   Oh, we got a whole writer's room and a team.
[00:48:55.780 --> 00:48:56.780]   Oh, yeah.
[00:48:56.780 --> 00:48:57.780]   Yeah.
[00:48:57.780 --> 00:48:58.780]   Several trained animals.
[00:48:58.780 --> 00:48:59.780]   All right.
[00:48:59.780 --> 00:49:00.780]   Take a break.
[00:49:00.780 --> 00:49:03.540]   We've been gassing on long enough.
[00:49:03.540 --> 00:49:07.300]   Let's talk about our sponsor and we will get back to Ant Pruitt.
[00:49:07.300 --> 00:49:10.460]   It's a Higg and Bathum, Jeff Jarvis, this week in Google.
[00:49:10.460 --> 00:49:12.700]   We have mentioned Google a couple of times.
[00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:15.420]   So we have we have acid.
[00:49:15.420 --> 00:49:22.020]   We're good in passing in between the the the rattles on magazines and things.
[00:49:22.020 --> 00:49:23.020]   Satellites.
[00:49:23.020 --> 00:49:26.180]   Satellites are shown today brought to you by Strake.
[00:49:26.180 --> 00:49:32.660]   This is actually a great solution for anybody who wants to manage their inbox.
[00:49:32.660 --> 00:49:36.660]   If you're a startup fan or an entrepreneur, if you run a business and you know, email
[00:49:36.660 --> 00:49:38.980]   is critical, right?
[00:49:38.980 --> 00:49:45.340]   Whether you're tracking sales or fundraising or hiring or support, Strake, S-T-R-E-A-K, is
[00:49:45.340 --> 00:49:49.900]   a CRM that will help your customer relationship manager.
[00:49:49.900 --> 00:49:52.660]   That will help you stay on top of all your processes.
[00:49:52.660 --> 00:49:55.740]   And it happens right inside Gmail.
[00:49:55.740 --> 00:49:57.060]   Right inside Gmail.
[00:49:57.060 --> 00:50:02.020]   You streaks free email tools to check if your emails have been opened and send bulk emails
[00:50:02.020 --> 00:50:05.940]   with automated follow up emails to improve your response rate.
[00:50:05.940 --> 00:50:10.300]   Because it's built inside a Gmail, it's already a part of your everyday workflow.
[00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:14.380]   You'll see details about your leads, your customers, your investors, right alongside
[00:50:14.380 --> 00:50:15.380]   your email.
[00:50:15.380 --> 00:50:17.460]   And there's no more switching between Gmail and other tools.
[00:50:17.460 --> 00:50:20.220]   It is it becomes part of Gmail.
[00:50:20.220 --> 00:50:25.500]   In fact, Strake was recognized as Google's technology partner of the year and used by
[00:50:25.500 --> 00:50:29.540]   thousands of founders and entrepreneurs and small business owners, whether you're prospecting
[00:50:29.540 --> 00:50:34.300]   for new customers, raising a fund raising round, growing your team or managing support
[00:50:34.300 --> 00:50:36.580]   tickets, use Strake's pipelines.
[00:50:36.580 --> 00:50:41.100]   This is a really cool feature to track all your processes directly from Gmail.
[00:50:41.100 --> 00:50:42.780]   It's easy to set up a pipeline.
[00:50:42.780 --> 00:50:44.260]   It takes a couple of minutes.
[00:50:44.260 --> 00:50:45.260]   You can customize them.
[00:50:45.260 --> 00:50:46.660]   It's a much better.
[00:50:46.660 --> 00:50:49.940]   It's kind of like, you know, folders and filtering.
[00:50:49.940 --> 00:50:50.980]   You're used to that idea.
[00:50:50.980 --> 00:50:53.820]   This is that on steroids.
[00:50:53.820 --> 00:50:58.260]   Strake makes it easy to collaborate by automatically sharing emails and notes with everyone on
[00:50:58.260 --> 00:51:01.220]   your team that can be part of your pipeline.
[00:51:01.220 --> 00:51:03.940]   You know, I watched Lisa because she lives in email.
[00:51:03.940 --> 00:51:04.940]   She lives in Gmail.
[00:51:04.940 --> 00:51:08.100]   We use Google Workspace.
[00:51:08.100 --> 00:51:14.100]   And I just watch what a difference it makes to have your email in order instead of just
[00:51:14.100 --> 00:51:18.820]   a big pile on your desk, which it is unfortunately in my email.
[00:51:18.820 --> 00:51:21.460]   I miss emails all the time.
[00:51:21.460 --> 00:51:22.460]   Try out Strake today.
[00:51:22.460 --> 00:51:23.460]   You know what?
[00:51:23.460 --> 00:51:25.820]   I'm going to do it.
[00:51:25.820 --> 00:51:30.180]   It's free to use on your own or you can use the pro pla-- free if you use it on your own
[00:51:30.180 --> 00:51:31.620]   or if you want to use it with a team.
[00:51:31.620 --> 00:51:32.620]   Look at the pro plan.
[00:51:32.620 --> 00:51:36.820]   In fact, we're going to get you 20% off your first year of their pro plan, which is the
[00:51:36.820 --> 00:51:42.380]   most popular option by going to streak.com/tweidgoogles.
[00:51:42.380 --> 00:51:45.420]   Technology partner of the year.
[00:51:45.420 --> 00:51:50.580]   S-T-R-E-A-K.com/tweid for 20% off.
[00:51:50.580 --> 00:51:52.980]   I bet Google thinks wishes they had invented it.
[00:51:52.980 --> 00:51:54.900]   It's a brilliant idea.
[00:51:54.900 --> 00:51:56.380]   You're in Gmail already.
[00:51:56.380 --> 00:52:00.980]   Manage it better with Strake.com/tweidgoogles.
[00:52:00.980 --> 00:52:05.100]   We thank them so much for their support.
[00:52:05.100 --> 00:52:08.940]   I got all excited when I read the headline, Mark Zuckerberg considering shutting down
[00:52:08.940 --> 00:52:10.980]   Facebook and Instagram.
[00:52:10.980 --> 00:52:13.220]   And then I saw, "Oh, it's only in Europe."
[00:52:13.220 --> 00:52:16.820]   Don't you love those headlines?
[00:52:16.820 --> 00:52:18.980]   Actually, I love it.
[00:52:18.980 --> 00:52:23.420]   The German and French ministers said, "Oh, fine."
[00:52:23.420 --> 00:52:25.420]   "Oh, the problem."
[00:52:25.420 --> 00:52:27.420]   "Oh, the problem."
[00:52:27.420 --> 00:52:31.060]   After being hacked, I've lived as I've lived on Facebook in Twitter for four years and
[00:52:31.060 --> 00:52:34.140]   life has been fantastic.
[00:52:34.140 --> 00:52:38.980]   German economy minister Robert Habek told reporters he was standing alongside French
[00:52:38.980 --> 00:52:47.380]   finance minister Bruno Le Mer who said, "I can confirm."
[00:52:47.380 --> 00:52:53.180]   Life is very good without Facebook and we would live very well without Facebook.
[00:52:53.180 --> 00:52:59.500]   Digital giants must understand that the European continent will resist and affirm its
[00:52:59.500 --> 00:53:00.500]   sovereignty.
[00:53:00.500 --> 00:53:02.580]   Oh, geez.
[00:53:02.580 --> 00:53:05.060]   So what's happening is, of course, the EU...
[00:53:05.060 --> 00:53:08.900]   Meanwhile, by the way, these people are not standing up to Putin who's trying to invade
[00:53:08.900 --> 00:53:12.060]   nations in Europe, but Facebook is threatening themselves.
[00:53:12.060 --> 00:53:17.580]   There are many kinds of invasion, monsieur.
[00:53:17.580 --> 00:53:27.540]   The issue is, the EU wants them to store data from EU users on European soil.
[00:53:27.540 --> 00:53:32.380]   Facebook says, "No, no.
[00:53:32.380 --> 00:53:33.540]   We need that here.
[00:53:33.540 --> 00:53:36.580]   We need that data at home."
[00:53:36.580 --> 00:53:42.580]   This is the so-called privacy shield agreement.
[00:53:42.580 --> 00:53:48.260]   Current agreements say, "Yeah, you can transfer data, but the EU is thinking about changing
[00:53:48.260 --> 00:53:49.260]   that."
[00:53:49.260 --> 00:53:57.700]   And Facebook's response was, "Well, well, if you do that, we probably, in quotes, no
[00:53:57.700 --> 00:54:03.460]   longer will be able to offer many of our most significant products and services including
[00:54:03.460 --> 00:54:05.380]   Facebook and Instagram in the EU."
[00:54:05.380 --> 00:54:07.780]   So here's a question.
[00:54:07.780 --> 00:54:11.260]   Do you think that there's a chance that they actually believe that metaverse is their
[00:54:11.260 --> 00:54:13.980]   future and that Facebook stays are numbered?
[00:54:13.980 --> 00:54:15.900]   That they don't care.
[00:54:15.900 --> 00:54:16.900]   Right.
[00:54:16.900 --> 00:54:20.420]   You think they kind of know that's where it's headed?
[00:54:20.420 --> 00:54:21.620]   It's too big.
[00:54:21.620 --> 00:54:25.740]   I mean, I think they're betting on the metaverse, but it's not like they're going to just be
[00:54:25.740 --> 00:54:27.780]   like, "They're not burning.
[00:54:27.780 --> 00:54:28.780]   What is it?
[00:54:28.780 --> 00:54:29.780]   Burning their ships?"
[00:54:29.780 --> 00:54:30.780]   Well, yeah, right.
[00:54:30.780 --> 00:54:31.780]   Cortez, right?
[00:54:31.780 --> 00:54:32.780]   We can't go home.
[00:54:32.780 --> 00:54:33.780]   Thank you.
[00:54:33.780 --> 00:54:34.780]   Yeah.
[00:54:34.780 --> 00:54:37.580]   There's several things that work here.
[00:54:37.580 --> 00:54:41.820]   I mean, it could simply be there trying to stare them down, say, "Go ahead, plain like
[00:54:41.820 --> 00:54:42.820]   you're checking."
[00:54:42.820 --> 00:54:43.820]   Yeah, I'll check in.
[00:54:43.820 --> 00:54:44.820]   Go ahead.
[00:54:44.820 --> 00:54:45.820]   Try it.
[00:54:45.820 --> 00:54:49.220]   Because they, sure, the French foreign minister could say, "We don't need you."
[00:54:49.220 --> 00:54:52.980]   But there are probably millions of Europeans who would not agree.
[00:54:52.980 --> 00:54:54.140]   What's the app especially?
[00:54:54.140 --> 00:54:58.180]   Although I bet you Instagram, I don't know how popular Instagram and Facebook, it's also
[00:54:58.180 --> 00:54:59.180]   possible.
[00:54:59.180 --> 00:55:03.860]   They've looked at the bottom line, said, "Well, it's 100 million euros a month or whatever.
[00:55:03.860 --> 00:55:06.900]   We can afford it and say, "We'll just write it off."
[00:55:06.900 --> 00:55:09.220]   Our stock's already in the tank, so what the heck?
[00:55:09.220 --> 00:55:13.060]   Well, that may actually, wouldn't that change the equation maybe, that they can't afford
[00:55:13.060 --> 00:55:14.060]   to do that?
[00:55:14.060 --> 00:55:19.820]   But by the way, ironically, the stock tanking is good for Facebook in one respect because
[00:55:19.820 --> 00:55:26.340]   they're now under the 600 billion threshold, which is all the old regulation is going for.
[00:55:26.340 --> 00:55:32.340]   The Congress regulations say, "Well, it only has to be big tech, 600 billion or more,"
[00:55:32.340 --> 00:55:34.460]   which Facebook no longer is.
[00:55:34.460 --> 00:55:36.460]   Imagine that.
[00:55:36.460 --> 00:55:37.460]   Isn't that funny?
[00:55:37.460 --> 00:55:42.340]   That's the number of the weak, man.
[00:55:42.340 --> 00:55:49.700]   Or you came up with a third wildcard possibility that their business is changing and they're
[00:55:49.700 --> 00:55:52.260]   willing to let go of this part of the business as long as they...
[00:55:52.260 --> 00:55:56.700]   But even if they do meta, they still want that data.
[00:55:56.700 --> 00:55:59.300]   No matter what Facebook does, they want that data.
[00:55:59.300 --> 00:56:02.300]   Well, they want the scale, the volume, the advertising.
[00:56:02.300 --> 00:56:03.700]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:56:03.700 --> 00:56:08.620]   But I think it's a silly theory, but they're almost acting like that.
[00:56:08.620 --> 00:56:09.620]   Like, "Okay."
[00:56:09.620 --> 00:56:11.660]   Well, I'm sure they want people to think.
[00:56:11.660 --> 00:56:13.620]   Just try us.
[00:56:13.620 --> 00:56:14.620]   Yeah.
[00:56:14.620 --> 00:56:15.620]   Yeah.
[00:56:15.620 --> 00:56:21.260]   Nick Kleg warned, and of course, he's known in the EU.
[00:56:21.260 --> 00:56:22.260]   Formerly the EU.
[00:56:22.260 --> 00:56:26.660]   Formerly in the area of the EU is no longer in the EU, warned that, quote, "A lack of
[00:56:26.660 --> 00:56:31.420]   safe, secure, and legal international data transfers would damage the economy and hamper
[00:56:31.420 --> 00:56:35.100]   the growth of data-driven businesses in the EU.
[00:56:35.100 --> 00:56:36.100]   The impact would be felt..."
[00:56:36.100 --> 00:56:37.900]   This is Facebook's playbook.
[00:56:37.900 --> 00:56:39.620]   Oh, think of the small businesses.
[00:56:39.620 --> 00:56:41.620]   Think of it in Australia.
[00:56:41.620 --> 00:56:42.620]   Yeah.
[00:56:42.620 --> 00:56:43.620]   Right.
[00:56:43.620 --> 00:56:44.620]   Where they threatened to pull out news.
[00:56:44.620 --> 00:56:46.020]   They did pull out news in Australia.
[00:56:46.020 --> 00:56:47.420]   They said, "Okay, fine.
[00:56:47.420 --> 00:56:49.260]   We'll take our toys and go home."
[00:56:49.260 --> 00:56:53.140]   In the worst case scenario, this could mean a small tech startup in Germany would no
[00:56:53.140 --> 00:56:56.660]   longer be able to use a US-based cloud provider.
[00:56:56.660 --> 00:56:57.900]   Oh, the horror.
[00:56:57.900 --> 00:56:58.900]   Don't...
[00:56:58.900 --> 00:57:00.340]   I think there's probably cloud providers in Germany.
[00:57:00.340 --> 00:57:03.860]   I might be wrong, or at least in the Strangen countries, right?
[00:57:03.860 --> 00:57:08.100]   A Spanish product development company could no longer be able to run an operation across
[00:57:08.100 --> 00:57:09.860]   multiple time zones.
[00:57:09.860 --> 00:57:10.860]   Oh, no.
[00:57:10.860 --> 00:57:12.420]   That's BS.
[00:57:12.420 --> 00:57:13.420]   Yeah.
[00:57:13.420 --> 00:57:15.820]   I run an operation over multiple time zones.
[00:57:15.820 --> 00:57:17.420]   I don't even step for that side.
[00:57:17.420 --> 00:57:18.420]   Peteloma.
[00:57:18.420 --> 00:57:23.740]   A frank Nick Kleg said, "A French retailer may find they can no longer maintain a call
[00:57:23.740 --> 00:57:25.260]   center in Morocco."
[00:57:25.260 --> 00:57:27.020]   Well, that may be true.
[00:57:27.020 --> 00:57:30.260]   I would bet the EU thinks that's a good thing.
[00:57:30.260 --> 00:57:32.500]   You know, bring him home.
[00:57:32.500 --> 00:57:35.700]   Anyway, it's a battle, obviously.
[00:57:35.700 --> 00:57:41.500]   This is a salvo in the war.
[00:57:41.500 --> 00:57:46.580]   Somebody in the chat room, Mr. Huggy, which obviously that means he's from Belgium, says,
[00:57:46.580 --> 00:57:51.420]   "What's App Facebook and Instagram are very popular in Europe?"
[00:57:51.420 --> 00:57:56.020]   Of course, what's that?
[00:57:56.020 --> 00:57:57.020]   That's global.
[00:57:57.020 --> 00:57:58.020]   Yeah.
[00:57:58.020 --> 00:58:00.220]   I think he pulled a plug on What's App anywhere.
[00:58:00.220 --> 00:58:04.500]   People will let you know you lose public support.
[00:58:04.500 --> 00:58:07.980]   They spin off What's App without affecting the core business?
[00:58:07.980 --> 00:58:08.980]   They don't want to.
[00:58:08.980 --> 00:58:12.220]   They don't want to because that's where everybody went.
[00:58:12.220 --> 00:58:15.080]   But does it have...
[00:58:15.080 --> 00:58:20.580]   The idea that it could be more stock growth and that doesn't really feed much data into
[00:58:20.580 --> 00:58:24.620]   Facebook, they could expand.
[00:58:24.620 --> 00:58:25.620]   Yeah.
[00:58:25.620 --> 00:58:33.200]   Well, basically, from Facebook's perspective, they want it because it gets people who aren't
[00:58:33.200 --> 00:58:34.200]   on Facebook, right?
[00:58:34.200 --> 00:58:36.220]   It gets people on their phones on Facebook.
[00:58:36.220 --> 00:58:41.380]   Yeah, the whole point of acquiring Instagram and What's App was to expand Facebook's reach
[00:58:41.380 --> 00:58:44.460]   to get data from people who don't use Facebook.
[00:58:44.460 --> 00:58:48.420]   And even better to incorporate data from people who do use Facebook and corporate even
[00:58:48.420 --> 00:58:53.820]   at Richard's set, like who you talk to, who you know, where you are, what you do.
[00:58:53.820 --> 00:58:58.380]   So is the business model for metaverse if it ever really exists?
[00:58:58.380 --> 00:59:03.260]   Advertising in data or is it instead pay walls and selling fake hay?
[00:59:03.260 --> 00:59:05.060]   Well, they haven't said yet.
[00:59:05.060 --> 00:59:07.060]   Yeah, I don't think they.
[00:59:07.060 --> 00:59:08.300]   Selling fake hay may actually.
[00:59:08.300 --> 00:59:12.660]   I mean, that's everybody's looking at how much money Fortnite makes selling downloadable
[00:59:12.660 --> 00:59:13.660]   content.
[00:59:13.660 --> 00:59:14.660]   Excuse me.
[00:59:14.660 --> 00:59:17.820]   Can I buy some legs, please?
[00:59:17.820 --> 00:59:18.820]   There's a...
[00:59:18.820 --> 00:59:20.540]   I mean, that was in Second Life.
[00:59:20.540 --> 00:59:28.300]   There was a very, that still is, I guess a very vibrant economy in app purchases and digital
[00:59:28.300 --> 00:59:31.140]   goods.
[00:59:31.140 --> 00:59:37.660]   Maybe I would bet you that that given Mark's future thinking, that's probably what he...
[00:59:37.660 --> 00:59:40.340]   So the bold thing would do, let's get out of the data business.
[00:59:40.340 --> 00:59:41.660]   It's going to get us in trouble.
[00:59:41.660 --> 00:59:42.660]   Right.
[00:59:42.660 --> 00:59:43.660]   Let's get out of that.
[00:59:43.660 --> 00:59:45.340]   Let's get out of the ad business.
[00:59:45.340 --> 00:59:46.980]   Apple has screwed us over.
[00:59:46.980 --> 00:59:50.580]   We can't really get the level of data that we've depended upon for growth.
[00:59:50.580 --> 00:59:51.580]   So let's go Apple.
[00:59:51.580 --> 00:59:52.580]   I'm just this.
[00:59:52.580 --> 00:59:53.580]   I'm not really a necessarily believing what I'm saying.
[00:59:53.580 --> 00:59:54.580]   I'm playing with it.
[00:59:54.580 --> 00:59:55.580]   No, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:59:55.580 --> 00:59:56.580]   This is a scenario.
[00:59:56.580 --> 00:59:57.580]   Oh, yeah.
[00:59:57.580 --> 00:59:58.580]   We did it.
[00:59:58.580 --> 00:59:59.580]   Yeah, we did it.
[00:59:59.580 --> 01:00:00.580]   But fine.
[01:00:00.580 --> 01:00:03.460]   To be really bold and strategic, let's find a way out of...
[01:00:03.460 --> 01:00:06.860]   I mean, if they got out of the web business and into mobile, could they get out of the
[01:00:06.860 --> 01:00:07.860]   data business?
[01:00:07.860 --> 01:00:11.140]   I'm projecting Mr. Zuckerberg, which is not easy since he doesn't have a human brain,
[01:00:11.140 --> 01:00:12.140]   but I'm trying.
[01:00:12.140 --> 01:00:14.660]   You have a much Zuckerberg voice you do?
[01:00:14.660 --> 01:00:15.660]   No.
[01:00:15.660 --> 01:00:19.660]   I would just do it like that.
[01:00:19.660 --> 01:00:23.180]   But not like him at all, but okay.
[01:00:23.180 --> 01:00:24.180]   Not like him at all.
[01:00:24.180 --> 01:00:25.180]   No, he's more robotic.
[01:00:25.180 --> 01:00:27.780]   But I think...
[01:00:27.780 --> 01:00:30.140]   I mean, here's what I think.
[01:00:30.140 --> 01:00:34.180]   A metaverse is a duplicate of the real world, right?
[01:00:34.180 --> 01:00:38.300]   So every possibility of making money in the real world becomes possible.
[01:00:38.300 --> 01:00:39.860]   What's commerce?
[01:00:39.860 --> 01:00:43.020]   As an analog in the metaverse, every one of them.
[01:00:43.020 --> 01:00:48.660]   And if you make your own metaverse, you take a percentage of all transactions.
[01:00:48.660 --> 01:00:50.340]   So isn't so much about data.
[01:00:50.340 --> 01:00:51.340]   It's more...
[01:00:51.340 --> 01:00:55.100]   I mean, it's funny because this is what Jeff Bezos was trying to do in the real world.
[01:00:55.100 --> 01:00:58.620]   Mark Zuckerberg says, "Well, we'll do it in our virtual world."
[01:00:58.620 --> 01:01:05.100]   And if you could get a billion or two billion people in this virtual world, this is kind
[01:01:05.100 --> 01:01:09.380]   of the debate over the metaverse is, "Do you want a metaverse that's run by individual
[01:01:09.380 --> 01:01:14.140]   companies?" so like I'm in the Apple metaverse, the Facebook metaverse, the Google metaverse.
[01:01:14.140 --> 01:01:16.220]   But he argued that everything ought to be interoperable.
[01:01:16.220 --> 01:01:17.220]   It should be interoperable.
[01:01:17.220 --> 01:01:18.220]   It's that metaverse video.
[01:01:18.220 --> 01:01:19.220]   Yeah.
[01:01:19.220 --> 01:01:20.220]   It always doesn't have value.
[01:01:20.220 --> 01:01:24.180]   But interestingly, I mean, on the ad side, the two companies that were not affected by
[01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:26.980]   Apple's moves were Google and Amazon.
[01:01:26.980 --> 01:01:32.020]   Because Amazon are their own vendors advertising to sell more of the stuff that's already there.
[01:01:32.020 --> 01:01:34.660]   And Google has its own ad infrastructure.
[01:01:34.660 --> 01:01:37.660]   I have a little bit of a contrarian point of view on this.
[01:01:37.660 --> 01:01:45.060]   Facebook said, "We might lose as much as $10 billion next year because of Apple's checkbox."
[01:01:45.060 --> 01:01:46.060]   And I think it's BS.
[01:01:46.060 --> 01:01:50.700]   I don't think that in fact they're trying to pretend that this little minor, all that
[01:01:50.700 --> 01:01:56.660]   checkbox does is say Apple says you can't have the ID for Apple advertising.
[01:01:56.660 --> 01:01:58.660]   Well, Mark and Sherb bought that.
[01:01:58.660 --> 01:01:59.660]   Yeah.
[01:01:59.660 --> 01:02:04.980]   Because I think Google and Facebook would like to pretend that there are ways to control
[01:02:04.980 --> 01:02:06.780]   what they know.
[01:02:06.780 --> 01:02:07.780]   It's in their interest.
[01:02:07.780 --> 01:02:08.780]   Oh, I see.
[01:02:08.780 --> 01:02:11.140]   It's the 40 chess theory.
[01:02:11.140 --> 01:02:12.140]   Yeah.
[01:02:12.140 --> 01:02:13.140]   They're playing 40 chess.
[01:02:13.140 --> 01:02:18.700]   Well, if anybody's going to play 40 chess, it's our friend, Mark Dada Zuckerberg.
[01:02:18.700 --> 01:02:24.020]   I think that probably they have found ways or will find ways.
[01:02:24.020 --> 01:02:25.020]   Snap even said this.
[01:02:25.020 --> 01:02:27.140]   They said, "It hasn't hurt us.
[01:02:27.140 --> 01:02:29.820]   We made money this quarter for the first time ever.
[01:02:29.820 --> 01:02:32.900]   And it may take a little while, but we're going to figure out ways to get all that data
[01:02:32.900 --> 01:02:33.900]   anyway."
[01:02:33.900 --> 01:02:37.980]   And the thing that shouldn't be settled out, which is, yeah, big deal.
[01:02:37.980 --> 01:02:39.580]   We can get all that data.
[01:02:39.580 --> 01:02:40.580]   Facebook, absolutely.
[01:02:40.580 --> 01:02:43.660]   Google absolutely have ways to get just as much data.
[01:02:43.660 --> 01:02:48.860]   They know, presuming that what Google and Facebook both want is to know everything there
[01:02:48.860 --> 01:02:53.500]   is to know about their users so that when they sell to advertisers, they can say, you
[01:02:53.500 --> 01:02:56.780]   know, you want a 65 year old man in Petaloma, I got them.
[01:02:56.780 --> 01:02:57.780]   I got all of them.
[01:02:57.780 --> 01:03:01.100]   Well, here's the other thing you're saying about the netherverse is maybe they don't
[01:03:01.100 --> 01:03:04.780]   get the data anymore to sell to advertisers because that's getting them in trouble.
[01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:08.180]   But they do get it to understand how to put the right pitch for commerce or services or
[01:03:08.180 --> 01:03:11.460]   other things to you themselves, which is the Amazon one.
[01:03:11.460 --> 01:03:14.580]   It's Monopcini again versus Malop.
[01:03:14.580 --> 01:03:15.580]   I'm just saying that.
[01:03:15.580 --> 01:03:22.300]   If you own the metaverse, you are the single source of everything in the metaverse.
[01:03:22.300 --> 01:03:24.340]   Actually, that is a monopoly.
[01:03:24.340 --> 01:03:26.340]   It's not a monopoly.
[01:03:26.340 --> 01:03:29.020]   It's all you're the only place people can go to buy everything.
[01:03:29.020 --> 01:03:30.500]   You're the company store.
[01:03:30.500 --> 01:03:31.500]   Then you're right.
[01:03:31.500 --> 01:03:34.820]   You don't need to sell advertising if you're the company store.
[01:03:34.820 --> 01:03:39.020]   I would sell in access, basically.
[01:03:39.020 --> 01:03:45.580]   Oh, they'd make it free because just like Fortnite, it's better to be free than you get
[01:03:45.580 --> 01:03:46.580]   more people.
[01:03:46.580 --> 01:03:47.580]   I don't know.
[01:03:47.580 --> 01:03:54.780]   I think that there is a class V mass kind of thing here.
[01:03:54.780 --> 01:03:55.780]   It's velvet ropes.
[01:03:55.780 --> 01:03:58.260]   How do I get it in the studio 54?
[01:03:58.260 --> 01:03:59.260]   You can do both.
[01:03:59.260 --> 01:04:01.900]   Yeah, I think there will be both.
[01:04:01.900 --> 01:04:05.580]   Yeah, you have a free and then you have the champagne room.
[01:04:05.580 --> 01:04:07.580]   It's like the public internet.
[01:04:07.580 --> 01:04:09.780]   Then you'll have the VIP.
[01:04:09.780 --> 01:04:14.180]   I only know about that from Howard Stern just to be clear.
[01:04:14.180 --> 01:04:17.460]   There's no sex in the champagne room.
[01:04:17.460 --> 01:04:18.460]   I know.
[01:04:18.460 --> 01:04:20.460]   I'll let you.
[01:04:20.460 --> 01:04:21.460]   Let you.
[01:04:21.460 --> 01:04:22.860]   There's lots of champagne.
[01:04:22.860 --> 01:04:27.140]   Yeah, but that's, I mean, of course, well, I don't know if they'll do that, but there's
[01:04:27.140 --> 01:04:28.140]   nothing that says they couldn't.
[01:04:28.140 --> 01:04:34.220]   I'm just trying to think, are we missing something in this, in this tale of their grand strategies?
[01:04:34.220 --> 01:04:36.940]   We're missing the metaverse.
[01:04:36.940 --> 01:04:39.660]   And until we have that, well, that's a good point.
[01:04:39.660 --> 01:04:40.660]   Well, that, yes.
[01:04:40.660 --> 01:04:43.300]   Oh, you mean it's completely made up and doesn't exist?
[01:04:43.300 --> 01:04:46.660]   Oh, yeah, we're, we're building theoreticals on top of hypothetical.
[01:04:46.660 --> 01:04:52.420]   So I'm like, very well, but it's a legit question to say, what's the plan?
[01:04:52.420 --> 01:04:53.420]   Yes.
[01:04:53.420 --> 01:04:54.420]   What's the plan?
[01:04:54.420 --> 01:04:59.140]   How, why would you spend billions and billions of dollars to create this thing?
[01:04:59.140 --> 01:05:00.820]   I mean, what's the, what's the upside?
[01:05:00.820 --> 01:05:02.780]   Well, they own the hardware.
[01:05:02.780 --> 01:05:07.260]   They're going to build out the computing infrastructure, which means if you want to
[01:05:07.260 --> 01:05:12.380]   head, if we build a real metaverse, you are going to need some really powerful computers
[01:05:12.380 --> 01:05:14.660]   to deliver that quality experience.
[01:05:14.660 --> 01:05:15.660]   I've long thought this.
[01:05:15.660 --> 01:05:16.660]   Plus the actual network.
[01:05:16.660 --> 01:05:17.660]   Like an AWS.
[01:05:17.660 --> 01:05:18.660]   Yeah.
[01:05:18.660 --> 01:05:19.660]   Yeah.
[01:05:19.660 --> 01:05:25.220]   I feel like there's a lot of opportunity here, like on the infrastructure side and then on
[01:05:25.220 --> 01:05:26.580]   the access side.
[01:05:26.580 --> 01:05:27.580]   Yes.
[01:05:27.580 --> 01:05:32.140]   And then also we don't have a rights framework yet for the metaverse.
[01:05:32.140 --> 01:05:34.100]   But there's like, we talked about this last week.
[01:05:34.100 --> 01:05:36.260]   What is it that people are buying up digital properties?
[01:05:36.260 --> 01:05:41.140]   But if you think about like what property means in the metaverse, there are opportunities
[01:05:41.140 --> 01:05:42.100]   there too.
[01:05:42.100 --> 01:05:47.660]   There's, I mean, opportunities are really endless because we don't actually know what
[01:05:47.660 --> 01:05:51.260]   it's going to look like or how it's going to or whether it ever exists.
[01:05:51.260 --> 01:05:52.260]   Yeah.
[01:05:52.260 --> 01:05:53.260]   That too.
[01:05:53.260 --> 01:05:59.700]   It's, I think it's fascinating.
[01:05:59.700 --> 01:06:05.660]   I am skeptical, but it's basically like all the sea stutters instead of actually building
[01:06:05.660 --> 01:06:06.660]   the island.
[01:06:06.660 --> 01:06:10.660]   They're just going to do it in, you know, so it'll be fascinating.
[01:06:10.660 --> 01:06:11.660]   Yeah.
[01:06:11.660 --> 01:06:15.940]   You want a crazy conspiracy theory even further than yours, Jeff.
[01:06:15.940 --> 01:06:21.020]   Mark knows that we're headed for a climate crisis, a total dystopia.
[01:06:21.020 --> 01:06:25.260]   And he wants to make a refuge.
[01:06:25.260 --> 01:06:30.780]   If at least we're all going to be in basements, but we'll be living in the past world in
[01:06:30.780 --> 01:06:31.780]   and none of the world.
[01:06:31.780 --> 01:06:37.460]   Yeah, which is by the way, exactly what the metaverse in ready player one is and so many
[01:06:37.460 --> 01:06:40.300]   stories, narrow answer, snow crash.
[01:06:40.300 --> 01:06:45.300]   It's all a refuge from the horrible real world dystopia.
[01:06:45.300 --> 01:06:50.700]   Let's still at the end of the day, Comcast is going to want their cut.
[01:06:50.700 --> 01:06:52.100]   Oh, Comcast is going to get it.
[01:06:52.100 --> 01:06:53.100]   You're right.
[01:06:53.100 --> 01:06:54.100]   You're right.
[01:06:54.100 --> 01:06:55.100]   That's what it's always been.
[01:06:55.100 --> 01:06:56.100]   It's what you're what's your bandwidth.
[01:06:56.100 --> 01:06:58.500]   You're going to be if you're living in the metaverse.
[01:06:58.500 --> 01:06:59.500]   Right.
[01:06:59.500 --> 01:07:03.580]   No, we're all going to have mesh and everything will be fine on the blockchain.
[01:07:03.580 --> 01:07:05.580]   In snow crash.
[01:07:05.580 --> 01:07:07.980]   Remember the day.
[01:07:07.980 --> 01:07:14.620]   They were wired only for like super big data transactions and everybody else was wireless
[01:07:14.620 --> 01:07:18.660]   and you had your free networks and like you're more capable networks.
[01:07:18.660 --> 01:07:21.620]   So I mean, we're kind of building that out today.
[01:07:21.620 --> 01:07:24.140]   Yeah, it's funny.
[01:07:24.140 --> 01:07:25.940]   You made an excellent point though, Stacey.
[01:07:25.940 --> 01:07:30.860]   We're acting as if this is just around the corner and it's it's it might even be a long
[01:07:30.860 --> 01:07:31.860]   shot.
[01:07:31.860 --> 01:07:32.860]   So it's BS upon BS.
[01:07:32.860 --> 01:07:34.900]   That's the ultimate answer to your question, Jeff.
[01:07:34.900 --> 01:07:37.940]   No, this is not Mark Zuckerberg saying, Oh, we don't care about Europe.
[01:07:37.940 --> 01:07:40.340]   We've got the metaverse because that's a long way.
[01:07:40.340 --> 01:07:41.340]   That's it.
[01:07:41.340 --> 01:07:42.340]   I know.
[01:07:42.340 --> 01:07:43.340]   I was playing Leo.
[01:07:43.340 --> 01:07:44.340]   Oh, good job.
[01:07:44.340 --> 01:07:46.740]   You fooled me sucked me right in.
[01:07:46.740 --> 01:07:47.740]   Wow.
[01:07:47.740 --> 01:07:50.980]   How old do you think we got a three hour show?
[01:07:50.980 --> 01:07:53.060]   Yeah, we managed somehow.
[01:07:53.060 --> 01:07:54.060]   Wow.
[01:07:54.060 --> 01:08:01.620]   Starlink launched 49 brand new starlink satellites, but they didn't pay attention to the weather
[01:08:01.620 --> 01:08:03.260]   report.
[01:08:03.260 --> 01:08:06.860]   The astronomical weather report.
[01:08:06.860 --> 01:08:12.900]   The space weather prediction center had a storm watch in place for the day of the launch
[01:08:12.900 --> 01:08:19.900]   due to a giant flare, a full halo coronal mass injection or FHCME.
[01:08:19.900 --> 01:08:23.940]   That sounds like a medical fee.
[01:08:23.940 --> 01:08:24.940]   Yes.
[01:08:24.940 --> 01:08:29.140]   A release of plasma and accompanying magnetic fields from the sun had they paid attention.
[01:08:29.140 --> 01:08:31.580]   They might have held off on the launch.
[01:08:31.580 --> 01:08:34.540]   40 of the 49 satellites are lost.
[01:08:34.540 --> 01:08:35.540]   Geez.
[01:08:35.540 --> 01:08:36.940]   40 of them.
[01:08:36.940 --> 01:08:45.740]   All 49 satellites reached their 200 kilometer perigee deployment orbit PDO.
[01:08:45.740 --> 01:08:52.220]   But what happened with the storm is actually like a headwind drag up to levels up to 50%
[01:08:52.220 --> 01:08:54.260]   higher than on previous launches.
[01:08:54.260 --> 01:08:59.440]   They tried to minimize the drag by putting the satellites into safe mode, which turns
[01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:01.660]   them to fly edge on.
[01:09:01.660 --> 01:09:07.340]   But the drag was so bad, it still buffeted the devices they could not then leave safe
[01:09:07.340 --> 01:09:12.500]   mode to get into their normal orbit and they started to spiral in.
[01:09:12.500 --> 01:09:13.500]   And that's it.
[01:09:13.500 --> 01:09:14.500]   They're right enough.
[01:09:14.500 --> 01:09:15.500]   Is this is this guy?
[01:09:15.500 --> 01:09:16.500]   Do they fall?
[01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:18.740]   No, they actually these are small enough.
[01:09:18.740 --> 01:09:19.740]   They burn up in reentry.
[01:09:19.740 --> 01:09:23.140]   I was hoping to have a twig contest if somebody brings us.
[01:09:23.140 --> 01:09:28.940]   I feel like we should only pay out like 10 bucks for that.
[01:09:28.940 --> 01:09:32.380]   I'll give you my flip phone.
[01:09:32.380 --> 01:09:34.220]   We're your flip phone.
[01:09:34.220 --> 01:09:35.220]   Yeah.
[01:09:35.220 --> 01:09:37.020]   Goodbye, flip to him.
[01:09:37.020 --> 01:09:43.140]   So I'm not all up on this this space stuff and space weather stuff like say Mr. Rod Powell
[01:09:43.140 --> 01:09:44.340]   is or what have you.
[01:09:44.340 --> 01:09:48.500]   But are you saying that they basically could have just checked the weather report that
[01:09:48.500 --> 01:09:50.060]   morning before doing this?
[01:09:50.060 --> 01:09:54.700]   Well, it would have been wise to not to launch it then.
[01:09:54.700 --> 01:09:56.460]   Yes.
[01:09:56.460 --> 01:10:00.140]   That's an expensive thing about space weather.
[01:10:00.140 --> 01:10:01.140]   Yeah.
[01:10:01.140 --> 01:10:03.740]   Well, if you're maybe the people in charge of launching satellites.
[01:10:03.740 --> 01:10:04.740]   There's a thing.
[01:10:04.740 --> 01:10:06.380]   I mean, this is space X.
[01:10:06.380 --> 01:10:08.620]   You should probably think about the weather.
[01:10:08.620 --> 01:10:12.940]   I'm thinking they had chicks and balances in place and this sounds like it was really
[01:10:12.940 --> 01:10:15.060]   nearly literally made the check this morning.
[01:10:15.060 --> 01:10:16.540]   A hundred of these satellites a week.
[01:10:16.540 --> 01:10:19.620]   So I think it might well be they went just out screw it, launch it.
[01:10:19.620 --> 01:10:20.620]   Well, I want it.
[01:10:20.620 --> 01:10:22.620]   It didn't take them down now.
[01:10:22.620 --> 01:10:23.620]   And they waited a week.
[01:10:23.620 --> 01:10:24.620]   No, once they're in orbit.
[01:10:24.620 --> 01:10:25.620]   They're going three weeks?
[01:10:25.620 --> 01:10:27.540]   No, no, I think they'd be OK.
[01:10:27.540 --> 01:10:28.540]   They'd be buffeted.
[01:10:28.540 --> 01:10:29.540]   But you don't want me to.
[01:10:29.540 --> 01:10:30.540]   They'd be OK.
[01:10:30.540 --> 01:10:32.740]   It was because they were hit during their deployment.
[01:10:32.740 --> 01:10:33.740]   Ah, I see.
[01:10:33.740 --> 01:10:35.140]   To the air orbit that they.
[01:10:35.140 --> 01:10:36.140]   OK.
[01:10:36.140 --> 01:10:37.140]   I think I know.
[01:10:37.140 --> 01:10:41.620]   Maybe that they don't have deployment processes because startups are really terrible.
[01:10:41.620 --> 01:10:48.380]   And I know that Elon Musk does not have bureaucracy tolerance, but this is exactly what bureaucracy
[01:10:48.380 --> 01:10:50.500]   and processes do.
[01:10:50.500 --> 01:10:53.140]   It's this sort of like, here is our checklist.
[01:10:53.140 --> 01:10:54.140]   Yeah.
[01:10:54.140 --> 01:10:55.140]   It's hard and boring.
[01:10:55.140 --> 01:10:57.620]   And a lot of companies hate doing that.
[01:10:57.620 --> 01:10:59.580]   So I can see how this could get missed.
[01:10:59.580 --> 01:11:03.860]   And when you got enough money sloshing around, it's fine.
[01:11:03.860 --> 01:11:07.940]   When we had the other space weather.com page, I go to every day.
[01:11:07.940 --> 01:11:09.820]   John says he checks it every day.
[01:11:09.820 --> 01:11:10.820]   What are you on?
[01:11:10.820 --> 01:11:11.820]   Could have saved those satellites.
[01:11:11.820 --> 01:11:12.820]   What are you looking for?
[01:11:12.820 --> 01:11:13.820]   Oh, no.
[01:11:13.820 --> 01:11:14.820]   What are you worried about?
[01:11:14.820 --> 01:11:15.820]   I want to bring whether to bring in a bra.
[01:11:15.820 --> 01:11:16.820]   I'm looking for where the.
[01:11:16.820 --> 01:11:17.820]   Where the.
[01:11:17.820 --> 01:11:18.820]   Where are your foil hats?
[01:11:18.820 --> 01:11:19.820]   Yeah.
[01:11:19.820 --> 01:11:21.820]   I look for that.
[01:11:21.820 --> 01:11:23.220]   We use to go every day.
[01:11:23.220 --> 01:11:28.140]   When we did the ham radio show, ham nation, of course, we would have a weekly space weather
[01:11:28.140 --> 01:11:32.980]   report because it absolutely affects your propagation of your ham signal and so forth.
[01:11:32.980 --> 01:11:38.420]   But that's a wild story.
[01:11:38.420 --> 01:11:42.820]   Significantly impacted by a geomagnetic storm on Friday.
[01:11:42.820 --> 01:11:43.820]   Oh, interesting.
[01:11:43.820 --> 01:11:49.020]   Two days before launch, a CME hit Earth's magnetic field, but it was not a major space
[01:11:49.020 --> 01:11:50.020]   weather event.
[01:11:50.020 --> 01:11:53.260]   In fact, this is from space weather.com.
[01:11:53.260 --> 01:11:57.820]   In fact, the weak impact did not a first spark any remarkable geomagnetic activity, but the
[01:11:57.820 --> 01:12:03.860]   Earth then passed through the wake of the coronal magnetic eruption.
[01:12:03.860 --> 01:12:07.020]   Some sputtering G1 class geomagnetic storms developed.
[01:12:07.020 --> 01:12:08.900]   It was one of these minor storms.
[01:12:08.900 --> 01:12:10.500]   So that you know what?
[01:12:10.500 --> 01:12:12.300]   This register article misstates it.
[01:12:12.300 --> 01:12:18.740]   And once you get to the actual guys at space weather.com and gals, they're saying, you
[01:12:18.740 --> 01:12:20.620]   know, it was unpredictable.
[01:12:20.620 --> 01:12:21.620]   It was okay.
[01:12:21.620 --> 01:12:22.620]   It was worse.
[01:12:22.620 --> 01:12:27.420]   It was one of these minor storms that caught the Starlink satellites.
[01:12:27.420 --> 01:12:29.060]   They didn't expect it.
[01:12:29.060 --> 01:12:33.620]   The Starlink team commanded the satellites into a safe mode where they would fly edge
[01:12:33.620 --> 01:12:37.260]   on like a sheet of paper to minimize drag.
[01:12:37.260 --> 01:12:40.780]   Preliminary analysis showed the increased drag at the low altitudes prevented the satellites
[01:12:40.780 --> 01:12:43.580]   from leaving safe mode to begin orbit raising maneuvers.
[01:12:43.580 --> 01:12:51.940]   And up to 40 of these satellites will reenter or already have re-entered the Earth's atmosphere.
[01:12:51.940 --> 01:12:53.340]   You want to see it?
[01:12:53.340 --> 01:12:54.340]   Sure.
[01:12:54.340 --> 01:12:59.780]   This is what it looks like when space debris re-enters the satellite, the rear to the Earth's
[01:12:59.780 --> 01:13:02.020]   atmosphere over Puerto Rico.
[01:13:02.020 --> 01:13:03.020]   Pretty excited.
[01:13:03.020 --> 01:13:04.620]   The better it comes down and burns up and stays up there.
[01:13:04.620 --> 01:13:07.660]   There comes the bottom of the screen there, that dot.
[01:13:07.660 --> 01:13:09.260]   There's another one.
[01:13:09.260 --> 01:13:10.260]   Here they come.
[01:13:10.260 --> 01:13:11.260]   It's like a key.
[01:13:11.260 --> 01:13:12.260]   It's like a con.
[01:13:12.260 --> 01:13:13.260]   Yeah.
[01:13:13.260 --> 01:13:14.260]   Oh, man.
[01:13:14.260 --> 01:13:15.260]   Oh, yeah.
[01:13:15.260 --> 01:13:18.540]   That's how it looks like a missile command.
[01:13:18.540 --> 01:13:20.700]   So they're burning up in the atmosphere.
[01:13:20.700 --> 01:13:22.140]   Wow.
[01:13:22.140 --> 01:13:24.100]   Wow.
[01:13:24.100 --> 01:13:28.780]   Have you actually ever seen?
[01:13:28.780 --> 01:13:29.780]   It's funny.
[01:13:29.780 --> 01:13:30.780]   I've seen it and it's wild.
[01:13:30.780 --> 01:13:34.700]   In fact, I have my train here said, did you see last night?
[01:13:34.700 --> 01:13:39.980]   There were UFOs that were like 60 of them in a row going across this guy's head.
[01:13:39.980 --> 01:13:42.620]   That's Starlink.
[01:13:42.620 --> 01:13:44.940]   When they launch them, they're in a daisy.
[01:13:44.940 --> 01:13:46.260]   They're in like a bracelet.
[01:13:46.260 --> 01:13:47.260]   Oh, I didn't know that.
[01:13:47.260 --> 01:13:48.260]   And they peel off.
[01:13:48.260 --> 01:13:50.900]   Yeah, it's really cool.
[01:13:50.900 --> 01:13:53.940]   And they're like that in all the astronomy pictures.
[01:13:53.940 --> 01:13:55.260]   Yes, exactly.
[01:13:55.260 --> 01:13:57.780]   Isn't that nice?
[01:13:57.780 --> 01:13:59.140]   All right.
[01:13:59.140 --> 01:14:04.660]   See, I wouldn't know because every time I look up at night, it's such a hazy sky here
[01:14:04.660 --> 01:14:05.660]   in this area.
[01:14:05.660 --> 01:14:06.660]   Yeah.
[01:14:06.660 --> 01:14:07.660]   I never get to see the moon.
[01:14:07.660 --> 01:14:08.660]   That's your cigar smoke.
[01:14:08.660 --> 01:14:10.660]   You got to go back.
[01:14:10.660 --> 01:14:14.860]   That's a country guy saying, in the big city.
[01:14:14.860 --> 01:14:16.260]   Oh, you're right.
[01:14:16.260 --> 01:14:18.940]   Is the sky brighter in North Kacalaki?
[01:14:18.940 --> 01:14:21.980]   Well, I mean, it's just always hazy here.
[01:14:21.980 --> 01:14:24.180]   Yeah, it's a lot easier here than it is.
[01:14:24.180 --> 01:14:28.700]   Yeah, even trying to get photographs of the moon is difficult because I just don't see
[01:14:28.700 --> 01:14:31.460]   it some nights unless it's three in the morning.
[01:14:31.460 --> 01:14:32.460]   Yeah.
[01:14:32.460 --> 01:14:34.260]   Plushion.
[01:14:34.260 --> 01:14:36.180]   Plushion.
[01:14:36.180 --> 01:14:39.900]   There are now more than a billion unicorns.
[01:14:39.900 --> 01:14:41.340]   Don't tell your daughter, Stacey.
[01:14:41.340 --> 01:14:45.100]   There are now, boy, more than a billion unicorns.
[01:14:45.100 --> 01:14:51.500]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[01:14:51.500 --> 01:14:55.500]   like how many orders of magnitude is that you're off?
[01:14:55.500 --> 01:15:00.700]   There are now more than a billion companies worth a thousand dollars a quarter.
[01:15:00.700 --> 01:15:03.700]   Oh, no, I got it backwards.
[01:15:03.700 --> 01:15:09.940]   For those of you on the audio, Leo, just blew it.
[01:15:09.940 --> 01:15:16.780]   There are now a lot of a thousand unicorns that's companies worth a billion dollars or
[01:15:16.780 --> 01:15:18.780]   more which used to be a rarity, right?
[01:15:18.780 --> 01:15:19.780]   That was a big deal.
[01:15:19.780 --> 01:15:20.780]   Oh, they're unicorns, right?
[01:15:20.780 --> 01:15:21.780]   I, oh, we're inflation.
[01:15:21.780 --> 01:15:22.780]   Leo, inflation.
[01:15:22.780 --> 01:15:27.740]   Is it inflation or is just there's a lot of venture capital money flowing out of our
[01:15:27.740 --> 01:15:28.740]   heat?
[01:15:28.740 --> 01:15:30.140]   So much so much.
[01:15:30.140 --> 01:15:37.020]   Like I was just when I was at Fortune in 2015, they did a list of unicorns for the first
[01:15:37.020 --> 01:15:38.020]   time.
[01:15:38.020 --> 01:15:39.820]   And I, how many were there?
[01:15:39.820 --> 01:15:41.300]   There was, it was ridiculous.
[01:15:41.300 --> 01:15:43.340]   It was like, yeah.
[01:15:43.340 --> 01:15:45.500]   Here it is.
[01:15:45.500 --> 01:15:47.500]   Let me find it.
[01:15:47.500 --> 01:15:49.300]   Oh, Fortune.
[01:15:49.300 --> 01:15:56.180]   All of this comes from raising enough money for a small portion of your company that the
[01:15:56.180 --> 01:16:00.420]   total, if you were to sell it all, which you haven't, would be more than a billion
[01:16:00.420 --> 01:16:01.420]   dollars.
[01:16:01.420 --> 01:16:08.180]   So if you raised $10 million for a 1% valuation, right, then you're a unicorn.
[01:16:08.180 --> 01:16:10.700]   So that's part of it also, you know.
[01:16:10.700 --> 01:16:12.020]   Oh, yeah.
[01:16:12.020 --> 01:16:14.900]   I was hoping they would tell me how many unicorns they had.
[01:16:14.900 --> 01:16:16.980]   There were like 25 or something ridiculous.
[01:16:16.980 --> 01:16:17.980]   Yeah.
[01:16:17.980 --> 01:16:18.980]   Yeah.
[01:16:18.980 --> 01:16:19.980]   It's your valuation.
[01:16:19.980 --> 01:16:23.420]   Evaluation is just a hope and a prayer.
[01:16:23.420 --> 01:16:24.420]   It's made up.
[01:16:24.420 --> 01:16:25.420]   Yeah.
[01:16:25.420 --> 01:16:28.620]   So when you're in the United States, this is from Bloomberg Business Week, dates to a
[01:16:28.620 --> 01:16:29.620]   23.
[01:16:29.620 --> 01:16:31.820]   I haven't heard that in a long time.
[01:16:31.820 --> 01:16:38.620]   When you're in the United States, the term unicorn dates to a 2013 article by Aileen Lee,
[01:16:38.620 --> 01:16:42.780]   a venture capitalist who had just started a firm called Cowboy Ventures, writing for
[01:16:42.780 --> 01:16:45.660]   Tech Crunch, which had just started up 2013.
[01:16:45.660 --> 01:16:46.660]   Is that all?
[01:16:46.660 --> 01:16:47.660]   No, Tech Crunch.
[01:16:47.660 --> 01:16:54.540]   No, Tech Crunch was around in like, when I joined Gigo Oum in 2008, Tech Crunch was already
[01:16:54.540 --> 01:16:55.540]   our competitor.
[01:16:55.540 --> 01:16:56.940]   Oh, I misread this.
[01:16:56.940 --> 01:16:58.020]   I thought it said News site.
[01:16:58.020 --> 01:16:59.940]   It said News site.
[01:16:59.940 --> 01:17:04.260]   Her article was about lessons investors could take from examining the few US-based tech
[01:17:04.260 --> 01:17:07.740]   companies that had reached a billion dollar valuation.
[01:17:07.740 --> 01:17:14.900]   In looking at private and US public US companies, found it since 2003, she identified 39 unicorns.
[01:17:14.900 --> 01:17:17.900]   This is in 2013.
[01:17:17.900 --> 01:17:25.340]   The first of all, I think it's going to be a little bit more than a million dollars.
[01:17:25.340 --> 01:17:30.660]   It's going to be a little bit more than a million dollars.
[01:17:30.660 --> 01:17:31.660]   I don't know.
[01:17:31.660 --> 01:17:35.120]   I think it's going to be a little bit more than a million dollars.
[01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:36.120]   I'm not sure.
[01:17:36.120 --> 01:17:40.700]   I'm going to be a little bit more than a million dollars.
[01:17:40.700 --> 01:17:51.100]   I'm going to be a little bit more than a million dollars.
[01:17:51.100 --> 01:17:55.900]   I'm going to be a little bit more than a million dollars.
[01:17:55.900 --> 01:18:01.340]   I'm going to be a little bit more than a million dollars.
[01:18:01.340 --> 01:18:05.340]   I'm going to be a little bit more than a million dollars.
[01:18:05.340 --> 01:18:09.340]   I'm going to be a little bit more than a million dollars.
[01:18:09.340 --> 01:18:12.780]   I'm going to be a little bit more than a million dollars.
[01:18:12.780 --> 01:18:16.220]   I'm going to be a little bit more than a million dollars.
[01:18:16.220 --> 01:18:19.740]   I'm going to be a little bit more than a million dollars.
[01:18:19.740 --> 01:18:23.580]   I'm going to be a little bit more than a million dollars.
[01:18:23.580 --> 01:18:27.020]   I'm going to be a little bit more than a million dollars.
[01:18:27.020 --> 01:18:31.500]   I'm going to be a little bit more than a million dollars.
[01:18:31.500 --> 01:18:34.860]   I'm going to be a little bit more than a million dollars.
[01:18:34.860 --> 01:18:37.980]   I'm going to be a little bit more than a million dollars.
[01:18:37.980 --> 01:18:43.660]   I'm going to be out for those Mazeltov cocktails people will be throwing.
[01:18:43.660 --> 01:18:45.420]   It's not a Gulag.
[01:18:45.420 --> 01:18:46.460]   It's Gulash.
[01:18:46.460 --> 01:18:48.460]   Come on.
[01:18:48.460 --> 01:18:54.380]   Now, by the way, George Conway has changed his Twitter handle to Senior Gaspacho Conway.
[01:18:54.380 --> 01:18:56.780]   I think that's going to be a trend.
[01:18:56.780 --> 01:18:59.260]   I think it might be a trend.
[01:18:59.260 --> 01:19:00.460]   Oh, no.
[01:19:00.460 --> 01:19:01.660]   I'm sorry.
[01:19:01.660 --> 01:19:03.340]   I did need to-
[01:19:03.340 --> 01:19:07.580]   I would have laughed out loud too, but we saw it earlier.
[01:19:07.580 --> 01:19:09.340]   Because I wasn't checking Twitter earlier.
[01:19:09.340 --> 01:19:10.220]   Yeah, that's why.
[01:19:10.220 --> 01:19:12.060]   You do it now.
[01:19:12.060 --> 01:19:14.140]   Back to unicorns in Bloomberg Business Week.
[01:19:14.140 --> 01:19:18.220]   They did a little table which you should have done at Gigahome at the time.
[01:19:18.220 --> 01:19:21.740]   What's a unicorn worth the brand value of my little pony?
[01:19:21.740 --> 01:19:23.740]   $302 million.
[01:19:23.740 --> 01:19:27.820]   The last unicorn all-time box office, $6.4 million.
[01:19:27.820 --> 01:19:31.820]   Dollars, Lisa Frank's annual sales estimate, $5.7 million.
[01:19:31.820 --> 01:19:35.420]   The unicorn tapestries, $1.1 million.
[01:19:35.980 --> 01:19:38.940]   A narwhal tusk, $18,500.
[01:19:38.940 --> 01:19:43.420]   Unicorn mascot cost $849.99.
[01:19:43.420 --> 01:19:47.260]   The Pokemon Rapidash card is $9.57.
[01:19:47.260 --> 01:19:52.380]   And a unicorn frappuccino, $4.95.
[01:19:52.380 --> 01:19:54.540]   I don't even know why they put this table in.
[01:19:54.540 --> 01:19:55.980]   It makes no-
[01:19:55.980 --> 01:19:57.260]   Because it's awesome.
[01:19:57.260 --> 01:19:58.140]   It's pretty awesome.
[01:19:58.140 --> 01:20:01.100]   It's entertainment right there.
[01:20:01.100 --> 01:20:05.740]   In 2015, I think they're referring to you, Stacy.
[01:20:05.740 --> 01:20:08.940]   Fortune ran a cover story, the age of unicorns.
[01:20:08.940 --> 01:20:12.060]   Yes, that was Erin and Dan's story.
[01:20:12.060 --> 01:20:13.340]   Erin Griffith and Dan Primak.
[01:20:13.340 --> 01:20:13.580]   Yep.
[01:20:13.580 --> 01:20:14.300]   Yeah.
[01:20:14.300 --> 01:20:16.940]   There's Erin talking.
[01:20:16.940 --> 01:20:18.140]   Oh, young Erin.
[01:20:18.140 --> 01:20:18.940]   Young Erin.
[01:20:18.940 --> 01:20:21.100]   She used to come on the show.
[01:20:21.100 --> 01:20:22.860]   I think we should get her on.
[01:20:22.860 --> 01:20:24.060]   She's a wire now.
[01:20:24.060 --> 01:20:24.540]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:20:24.540 --> 01:20:25.820]   No, she's the New York Times now.
[01:20:25.820 --> 01:20:26.620]   Oh, that's why.
[01:20:26.620 --> 01:20:27.980]   She's a big shot now.
[01:20:27.980 --> 01:20:28.540]   That's why.
[01:20:28.540 --> 01:20:30.780]   That's what happened.
[01:20:30.780 --> 01:20:33.740]   Interesting.
[01:20:33.740 --> 01:20:34.460]   It's funny.
[01:20:34.460 --> 01:20:36.300]   So were you doing research for this article?
[01:20:36.300 --> 01:20:38.300]   Or you were writing another article?
[01:20:38.300 --> 01:20:38.700]   No, no, no.
[01:20:38.700 --> 01:20:40.940]   I was while I was there.
[01:20:40.940 --> 01:20:42.620]   They were doing this article.
[01:20:42.620 --> 01:20:44.060]   I think they asked me two questions
[01:20:44.060 --> 01:20:46.220]   about some chip companies that were unicorny.
[01:20:46.220 --> 01:20:48.220]   That sounds like Erin and Dan.
[01:20:48.220 --> 01:20:49.980]   Okay.
[01:20:49.980 --> 01:20:50.860]   Let's take a break.
[01:20:50.860 --> 01:20:53.500]   We still have a change log.
[01:20:53.500 --> 01:20:54.540]   We haven't done.
[01:20:54.540 --> 01:20:55.580]   Oh, we've got time.
[01:20:55.580 --> 01:20:56.140]   Yeah.
[01:20:56.140 --> 01:20:57.420]   We have stories about Google.
[01:20:57.420 --> 01:20:59.820]   And I really want to talk about this whole radio thing.
[01:20:59.820 --> 01:21:01.260]   Because people have been asking me about it.
[01:21:01.260 --> 01:21:02.220]   I think it's fascinating.
[01:21:02.220 --> 01:21:03.420]   Let's do that.
[01:21:03.420 --> 01:21:10.220]   Also, the rap star who used to write for Forbes,
[01:21:10.220 --> 01:21:13.420]   who is now in a little bit of hot water,
[01:21:13.420 --> 01:21:15.820]   a little bit of hot water,
[01:21:15.820 --> 01:21:19.260]   the crypto arrest music video coming up.
[01:21:19.260 --> 01:21:21.740]   Forbes, how could that be the case?
[01:21:21.740 --> 01:21:23.180]   Forbes is just so upstanding.
[01:21:23.180 --> 01:21:23.740]   Oh, man.
[01:21:23.740 --> 01:21:24.380]   Nothing but the best.
[01:21:24.380 --> 01:21:25.100]   Oh, man.
[01:21:25.100 --> 01:21:25.660]   Oh, man.
[01:21:25.660 --> 01:21:30.140]   And actually, there's a weird jam pack.
[01:21:30.140 --> 01:21:31.420]   I might have to move along here.
[01:21:31.980 --> 01:21:35.660]   Age verification for porn.
[01:21:35.660 --> 01:21:40.460]   And the IRS finally drops face ID.
[01:21:40.460 --> 01:21:42.540]   We talked about that like two weeks ago.
[01:21:42.540 --> 01:21:44.300]   And they finally saw the light on that one.
[01:21:44.300 --> 01:21:45.820]   But first word from.
[01:21:45.820 --> 01:21:47.020]   Well, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
[01:21:47.020 --> 01:21:48.140]   I got a catcher of the act.
[01:21:48.140 --> 01:21:52.300]   I see Stacy in the rundown down at the Pickleball magazines.
[01:21:52.300 --> 01:21:53.900]   She's using this one with the subscribe.
[01:21:53.900 --> 01:21:57.260]   I'm adding something to the run.
[01:21:57.260 --> 01:21:58.380]   It's OK.
[01:21:58.380 --> 01:21:59.660]   Oh, oh, yes.
[01:22:00.860 --> 01:22:01.500]   Go ahead.
[01:22:01.500 --> 01:22:03.740]   I'm not subscribing.
[01:22:03.740 --> 01:22:04.620]   Oh, my goodness.
[01:22:04.620 --> 01:22:06.060]   Jeff, bad Jeff.
[01:22:06.060 --> 01:22:08.300]   Also, we're about to go to break.
[01:22:08.300 --> 01:22:10.220]   It's totally reasonable to shop during the break.
[01:22:10.220 --> 01:22:11.180]   Oh, OK.
[01:22:11.180 --> 01:22:12.620]   We appreciate our sponsors.
[01:22:12.620 --> 01:22:17.100]   I listen to the sponsors.
[01:22:17.100 --> 01:22:19.100]   I hang on Leo's every word.
[01:22:19.100 --> 01:22:20.140]   He's doing Houston's.
[01:22:20.140 --> 01:22:21.180]   This is actually really.
[01:22:21.180 --> 01:22:21.740]   I chose Swaffles.
[01:22:21.740 --> 01:22:25.020]   Yeah.
[01:22:25.020 --> 01:22:26.700]   You know, that's not a bad idea.
[01:22:26.700 --> 01:22:27.740]   Go toast to waffle.
[01:22:27.740 --> 01:22:29.900]   Well, I talk about hacker.
[01:22:29.900 --> 01:22:31.740]   I know hacker rank because I do there.
[01:22:31.740 --> 01:22:33.980]   They have challenges, coding challenges,
[01:22:33.980 --> 01:22:35.100]   which I do and I love.
[01:22:35.100 --> 01:22:38.780]   Hacker rank is a great place to go.
[01:22:38.780 --> 01:22:41.500]   If you want to hire coders or if you are a coder
[01:22:41.500 --> 01:22:42.620]   and you want to get hired.
[01:22:42.620 --> 01:22:46.220]   But you know, one of the big pain points
[01:22:46.220 --> 01:22:49.740]   for both sides with getting hired or hiring
[01:22:49.740 --> 01:22:52.940]   is the interview, right?
[01:22:52.940 --> 01:22:56.460]   Between deadlines and frustrating interview tools
[01:22:56.460 --> 01:22:58.620]   that just aren't set up for technical interviews,
[01:22:59.180 --> 01:23:02.780]   conducting a tech interview might be the thing you dread the most.
[01:23:02.780 --> 01:23:05.660]   You have to spend the first 10 minutes of your interview
[01:23:05.660 --> 01:23:07.740]   just trying to set up an environment to share code
[01:23:07.740 --> 01:23:10.140]   from a dozen documents that waste your time,
[01:23:10.140 --> 01:23:11.420]   that waste your candidates time.
[01:23:11.420 --> 01:23:14.940]   Well, hacker rank has a solution, really cool solution.
[01:23:14.940 --> 01:23:17.580]   It's an IDE for tech interviews.
[01:23:17.580 --> 01:23:19.340]   What?
[01:23:19.340 --> 01:23:19.900]   Yes.
[01:23:19.900 --> 01:23:22.140]   It's got a set of easy to use interview tools.
[01:23:22.140 --> 01:23:23.260]   There it is right there.
[01:23:23.260 --> 01:23:24.220]   It's an IDE.
[01:23:24.220 --> 01:23:25.020]   I love it.
[01:23:25.020 --> 01:23:26.620]   You'll quickly find the best developers
[01:23:26.620 --> 01:23:27.820]   for your technical projects.
[01:23:27.820 --> 01:23:31.660]   The developer interview tool includes a pre-made question library.
[01:23:31.660 --> 01:23:32.780]   That saves a lot of time.
[01:23:32.780 --> 01:23:34.460]   2,500 questions.
[01:23:34.460 --> 01:23:37.020]   So you can quickly find the right one for your coding needs.
[01:23:37.020 --> 01:23:42.300]   A code playback feature so you can review the candidate's coding approach
[01:23:42.300 --> 01:23:44.220]   and score their skill levels.
[01:23:44.220 --> 01:23:46.060]   It's even got a built-in whiteboard.
[01:23:46.060 --> 01:23:50.060]   So the two of you can collaborate in real time to see how problems are solved.
[01:23:50.060 --> 01:23:51.340]   This is fun.
[01:23:51.340 --> 01:23:54.700]   It makes me want to hire some coders.
[01:23:54.700 --> 01:23:58.220]   It's time to reboot your technical interview process with hacker rank.
[01:23:58.220 --> 01:24:00.780]   Of course, click interview done.

[01:24:44.940 --> 01:24:46.300]   I love hacker rank.
[01:24:46.300 --> 01:24:47.100]   These guys are great.
[01:24:47.100 --> 01:24:48.540]   And what a great tool.
[01:24:48.540 --> 01:24:52.220]   HackerRank.com/twig.
[01:24:52.860 --> 01:24:57.100]   I totally admire how excited you get about an IDE.
[01:24:57.100 --> 01:24:59.100]   I love my D's.
[01:24:59.100 --> 01:25:02.060]   I was like, I bring my headphones.
[01:25:02.060 --> 01:25:04.060]   I'm looking in the fridge.
[01:25:04.060 --> 01:25:04.860]   I'm in the environment.
[01:25:04.860 --> 01:25:07.020]   Yeah, we live in those.
[01:25:07.020 --> 01:25:08.380]   You just start talking about ID's?
[01:25:08.380 --> 01:25:09.260]   I love ID's.
[01:25:09.260 --> 01:25:11.900]   ID's and Waffle Toast.
[01:25:11.900 --> 01:25:15.740]   Do you listen to KUOW in beautiful Seattle?
[01:25:15.740 --> 01:25:17.420]   I do.
[01:25:17.420 --> 01:25:18.300]   Okay, be careful.
[01:25:19.020 --> 01:25:24.380]   If you have a 2016 Mazda.
[01:25:24.380 --> 01:25:26.140]   I do.
[01:25:26.140 --> 01:25:28.060]   Do you really?
[01:25:28.060 --> 01:25:28.860]   Yes, I do.
[01:25:28.860 --> 01:25:29.660]   Well, so this tends to be--
[01:25:29.660 --> 01:25:30.940]   And he's an NPR listener.
[01:25:30.940 --> 01:25:33.020]   This actually intrigues me
[01:25:33.020 --> 01:25:38.860]   because it turns out there's a flaw in the rendering coders
[01:25:38.860 --> 01:25:40.140]   we'll know all about this.
[01:25:40.140 --> 01:25:42.220]   They're not sanitizing their inputs.
[01:25:42.220 --> 01:25:43.340]   There's a flaw in the engine.
[01:25:43.340 --> 01:25:46.780]   They actually use JavaScript to render the screen.
[01:25:46.780 --> 01:25:47.580]   Not the car engine.
[01:25:47.580 --> 01:25:48.220]   Not the key engine.
[01:25:48.220 --> 01:25:49.100]   Key engine.
[01:25:49.100 --> 01:25:50.540]   Yeah, the code engine.
[01:25:50.540 --> 01:25:51.420]   To render the screen,
[01:25:51.420 --> 01:25:54.140]   they use JavaScript on the entertainment unit.
[01:25:54.140 --> 01:25:56.380]   And apparently it has trouble with
[01:25:56.380 --> 01:26:00.700]   Unicode characters and some punctuation.
[01:26:00.700 --> 01:26:02.460]   And it'll actually crash it.
[01:26:02.460 --> 01:26:03.820]   So they're apparently a lot of--
[01:26:03.820 --> 01:26:05.820]   I'll just crash it, but brick it.
[01:26:05.820 --> 01:26:06.380]   Brick it.
[01:26:06.380 --> 01:26:09.500]   And there are a lot of people who can only listen to KUOW
[01:26:09.500 --> 01:26:13.340]   in their Mazda permanently stuck a 94.9 FM.
[01:26:13.340 --> 01:26:14.140]   Oh.
[01:26:14.140 --> 01:26:15.100]   Oh.
[01:26:15.100 --> 01:26:16.540]   Because--
[01:26:16.540 --> 01:26:16.940]   So--
[01:26:17.580 --> 01:26:22.700]   They didn't-- they have a little extra stuff in the text.
[01:26:22.700 --> 01:26:27.740]   R's Technica did a better story because KUOW's story
[01:26:27.740 --> 01:26:28.940]   starts talking about 5G.
[01:26:28.940 --> 01:26:29.500]   They didn't understand it.
[01:26:29.500 --> 01:26:30.380]   They didn't understand it.
[01:26:30.380 --> 01:26:31.020]   That's why.
[01:26:31.020 --> 01:26:32.220]   I read their story.
[01:26:32.220 --> 01:26:33.020]   I was like, what?
[01:26:33.020 --> 01:26:34.620]   Well, of course they didn't understand it.
[01:26:34.620 --> 01:26:37.180]   So yeah, R's Technica figured out that that's what it is.
[01:26:37.180 --> 01:26:38.220]   It's a Unicode issue.
[01:26:38.220 --> 01:26:41.020]   Yeah, so it's not a 5G issue.
[01:26:41.020 --> 01:26:41.980]   Oh, not at all.
[01:26:41.980 --> 01:26:42.700]   We're looking at that.
[01:26:42.700 --> 01:26:42.940]   Yeah.
[01:26:42.940 --> 01:26:44.380]   But this to me--
[01:26:44.380 --> 01:26:46.220]   Okay, so I love this story
[01:26:47.100 --> 01:26:48.860]   because it shows--
[01:26:48.860 --> 01:26:51.820]   like we're building out as we connect all this stuff.
[01:26:51.820 --> 01:26:54.540]   And we have companies who are not necessarily
[01:26:54.540 --> 01:26:58.700]   used to dealing with software over like a 10 year time frame,
[01:26:58.700 --> 01:27:00.460]   maybe, like a car's life,
[01:27:00.460 --> 01:27:04.460]   figuring out how not to accidentally break it.
[01:27:04.460 --> 01:27:06.700]   And then what happens when you break it?
[01:27:06.700 --> 01:27:08.220]   Who's responsible?
[01:27:08.220 --> 01:27:10.700]   Because the issue here is they break these people's
[01:27:10.700 --> 01:27:11.900]   infotainment centers.
[01:27:11.900 --> 01:27:15.580]   It's going to cost them money to actually physically replace it
[01:27:15.580 --> 01:27:16.380]   if they were whatever they really are.
[01:27:16.380 --> 01:27:19.980]   But it's Mazda's fault for not properly handling.
[01:27:19.980 --> 01:27:23.820]   You can't assume what's going to come in over the airwaves.
[01:27:23.820 --> 01:27:24.780]   It's a mistake.
[01:27:24.780 --> 01:27:25.260]   Right.
[01:27:25.260 --> 01:27:26.780]   And Middly KUW Blue.
[01:27:26.780 --> 01:27:28.780]   But wait a minute, they're not the first to do this.
[01:27:28.780 --> 01:27:32.300]   There's a podcast called 99% Invisible.
[01:27:32.300 --> 01:27:33.420]   Have you heard of this podcast?
[01:27:33.420 --> 01:27:35.020]   There's a--
[01:27:35.020 --> 01:27:35.580]   It's a great podcast.
[01:27:35.580 --> 01:27:36.940]   It's a great podcast.
[01:27:36.940 --> 01:27:39.740]   But don't listen to it in your 2016 Mazda.
[01:27:39.740 --> 01:27:43.100]   And this is the same thing.
[01:27:43.100 --> 01:27:45.500]   There's a percent in the name of this show.
[01:27:45.500 --> 01:27:48.540]   They actually had to create a Mazda safe feed.
[01:27:48.540 --> 01:27:50.220]   Oh, man.
[01:27:50.220 --> 01:27:51.580]   Wow.
[01:27:51.580 --> 01:27:53.500]   So then it is Mazda's fault.
[01:27:53.500 --> 01:27:55.420]   It's totally Mazda's fault.
[01:27:55.420 --> 01:28:00.300]   So the Mazda safe feed has 99 P-E-R-C-E-N-T
[01:28:00.300 --> 01:28:01.420]   Invisible instead of--
[01:28:01.420 --> 01:28:02.220]   Instead of December.
[01:28:02.220 --> 01:28:02.860]   --a second song.
[01:28:02.860 --> 01:28:06.780]   So because Mazda's not replacing--
[01:28:06.780 --> 01:28:08.540]   Mazda's like, no, we're not going to replace that.
[01:28:08.540 --> 01:28:09.100]   That's--
[01:28:09.100 --> 01:28:10.220]   Oh, it's bad coding.
[01:28:10.220 --> 01:28:10.940]   The problem.
[01:28:10.940 --> 01:28:11.740]   No, it's not.
[01:28:11.740 --> 01:28:12.220]   But they--
[01:28:12.220 --> 01:28:13.660]   Mazda says--
[01:28:13.660 --> 01:28:14.940]   Mazda did--
[01:28:14.940 --> 01:28:17.580]   Mazda said, look, there's a spec for--
[01:28:17.580 --> 01:28:19.740]   It's, you know, it's this additional information
[01:28:19.740 --> 01:28:22.380]   that comes through a radio channel nowadays
[01:28:22.380 --> 01:28:23.820]   that you display on the screen.
[01:28:23.820 --> 01:28:25.020]   And it shows you the name of the artist.
[01:28:25.020 --> 01:28:25.900]   Blah, blah, blah.
[01:28:25.900 --> 01:28:28.620]   That KUOW sent album arts through.
[01:28:28.620 --> 01:28:33.580]   And it crashed the Mazda software.
[01:28:33.580 --> 01:28:35.660]   But honestly, I mean, you can debate.
[01:28:35.660 --> 01:28:37.660]   And Mazda's going to say, well, that's an old car.
[01:28:37.660 --> 01:28:38.860]   We're not going to fix it.
[01:28:38.860 --> 01:28:41.260]   Because it is, at least it's a six-year-old car.
[01:28:41.260 --> 01:28:41.980]   But it is their--
[01:28:41.980 --> 01:28:42.700]   Hey.
[01:28:42.700 --> 01:28:43.180]   Hey.
[01:28:43.180 --> 01:28:44.700]   That's not an old car?
[01:28:44.700 --> 01:28:45.660]   My car's six-year.
[01:28:45.660 --> 01:28:46.860]   My car's seven years old.
[01:28:46.860 --> 01:28:48.140]   And it's a Tesla, y'all.
[01:28:48.140 --> 01:28:49.500]   Oh, it was a little car.
[01:28:49.500 --> 01:28:51.500]   Older than three in years.
[01:28:51.500 --> 01:28:54.380]   It was--
[01:28:54.380 --> 01:28:55.260]   Well, yeah.
[01:28:55.260 --> 01:28:57.900]   You're the guy who goes off by $1,500.
[01:28:57.900 --> 01:28:57.900]   $1,500.
[01:28:57.900 --> 01:29:00.380]   I'm not rich.
[01:29:00.380 --> 01:29:01.260]   I'm not rich.
[01:29:01.260 --> 01:29:02.220]   I just--
[01:29:02.220 --> 01:29:04.940]   We lease our cars so they'll get into one every three
[01:29:04.940 --> 01:29:05.260]   years.
[01:29:05.260 --> 01:29:05.900]   And that's why.
[01:29:05.900 --> 01:29:10.940]   So, ours Technica did figure it out.
[01:29:10.940 --> 01:29:13.900]   Apparently, so did 99% invisible.
[01:29:13.900 --> 01:29:17.660]   And honestly, it's not--
[01:29:17.660 --> 01:29:19.500]   I'm sorry, 2016.
[01:29:19.500 --> 01:29:20.860]   So it's a six-year-old, Mazda.
[01:29:20.860 --> 01:29:27.340]   Well, it says it affects cars from 2014 to 2017.
[01:29:27.340 --> 01:29:28.380]   Oh, interesting.
[01:29:28.380 --> 01:29:29.740]   So the KU-O-W.
[01:29:29.740 --> 01:29:31.580]   I think there's two issues.
[01:29:31.580 --> 01:29:33.820]   I think there's two separate things running around here.
[01:29:33.820 --> 01:29:36.220]   One is specific to 2016 year olds.
[01:29:36.220 --> 01:29:38.060]   And apparently Mazda does say--
[01:29:38.060 --> 01:29:40.220]   I feel like ours must have updated the story--
[01:29:40.220 --> 01:29:42.140]   that customers can--
[01:29:42.140 --> 01:29:43.740]   Mazda will replace it now.
[01:29:43.740 --> 01:29:46.140]   For goodwill.
[01:29:46.140 --> 01:29:48.140]   They're not admitting it to helpability.
[01:29:48.140 --> 01:29:48.700]   Yeah.
[01:29:48.700 --> 01:29:49.180]   Right.
[01:29:49.180 --> 01:29:51.980]   But because of the chip shortage, it might take a while.
[01:29:51.980 --> 01:29:52.700]   Right.
[01:29:52.700 --> 01:29:56.380]   But meanwhile, they got to listen to nothing
[01:29:56.380 --> 01:29:58.220]   with liberal NPR.
[01:29:58.220 --> 01:30:00.460]   It's a conspiracy.
[01:30:00.460 --> 01:30:01.100]   I tell you.
[01:30:01.100 --> 01:30:04.940]   So sanitize your inputs, kids.
[01:30:04.940 --> 01:30:06.780]   Yeah, this is--
[01:30:06.780 --> 01:30:08.300]   I mean, this is so tough.
[01:30:08.300 --> 01:30:11.420]   We're going to see-- I'm imagining if I download some software
[01:30:11.420 --> 01:30:13.500]   to run energy management for my home,
[01:30:13.500 --> 01:30:15.500]   which I'm super excited about by.
[01:30:15.500 --> 01:30:19.980]   But what if that does something to my old Nest thermostat?
[01:30:19.980 --> 01:30:20.940]   I'm like, oh, crap.
[01:30:20.940 --> 01:30:22.380]   How do I fix that?
[01:30:22.380 --> 01:30:25.180]   We're getting to this era where we've got all these software
[01:30:25.180 --> 01:30:27.660]   interdependencies and we're not creating provisions
[01:30:27.660 --> 01:30:30.140]   to help consumers through the resulting problems.
[01:30:30.140 --> 01:30:31.580]   And it's going to suck.
[01:30:31.580 --> 01:30:37.740]   XKCD-ish episode or comic strip 327.
[01:30:37.740 --> 01:30:39.180]   Exploits of a mom.
[01:30:39.180 --> 01:30:40.620]   Hi.
[01:30:40.620 --> 01:30:42.060]   This is your son's school.
[01:30:42.060 --> 01:30:43.660]   We're having some computer trouble.
[01:30:43.660 --> 01:30:44.860]   Oh, dear.
[01:30:44.860 --> 01:30:45.820]   Did he break something?
[01:30:45.820 --> 01:30:47.100]   In a way.
[01:30:47.100 --> 01:30:53.260]   Did you really name your son Robert Tick parenthesis semicolon
[01:30:53.260 --> 01:30:54.380]   drop table students?
[01:30:54.380 --> 01:30:57.820]   Because I'm going to go and dash dash question mark.
[01:30:57.820 --> 01:30:58.380]   Oh, yeah.
[01:30:58.380 --> 01:31:00.700]   Little Bobby tables, we call them.
[01:31:00.700 --> 01:31:03.660]   Well, we've lost this year's student records.
[01:31:03.660 --> 01:31:05.260]   I hope you're happy.
[01:31:05.260 --> 01:31:09.820]   And I hope you have learned to sanitize your database inputs.
[01:31:09.820 --> 01:31:10.300]   Nice.
[01:31:10.300 --> 01:31:11.580]   Little Bobby tables.
[01:31:11.580 --> 01:31:16.540]   So a moment from Uncle Jeff here, when the Chicago Tribune was
[01:31:16.540 --> 01:31:19.180]   switching from line types to cold type.
[01:31:19.180 --> 01:31:24.380]   Big, big machine to set type with photography.
[01:31:24.380 --> 01:31:26.700]   The whole thing died one day.
[01:31:26.700 --> 01:31:28.220]   The addition couldn't almost didn't get out.
[01:31:28.220 --> 01:31:33.100]   The reason was that a golf score happened to be a clone for a race score.
[01:31:33.100 --> 01:31:37.500]   [laughter]
[01:31:37.500 --> 01:31:38.860]   That's hilarious.
[01:31:38.860 --> 01:31:42.780]   So everything stays the same.
[01:31:42.780 --> 01:31:43.340]   I love it.
[01:31:43.340 --> 01:31:43.580]   Yeah.
[01:31:43.580 --> 01:31:44.060]   Yeah.
[01:31:44.060 --> 01:31:45.500]   Oh, Lord.
[01:31:45.500 --> 01:31:46.940]   Wow.
[01:31:46.940 --> 01:31:55.340]   Facebook, I'm sorry, Feds could be Facebook, but Feds have arrested a married couple.
[01:31:55.340 --> 01:32:03.660]   They say were in possession of $3.6 billion in Bitcoin,
[01:32:03.660 --> 01:32:10.060]   allegedly stolen as part of a 2016 hack of Bitfinex, which is a Bitcoin exchange.
[01:32:10.060 --> 01:32:15.420]   Authorities arrested a husband and wife in New York for allegedly trying to launder
[01:32:15.420 --> 01:32:23.100]   the Bitcoin tech entrepreneur, Ilya Lichtenstein, 34, and his rapper wife,
[01:32:23.100 --> 01:32:26.220]   Heather Morgan, 31, were charged with conspiring to launder money.
[01:32:26.220 --> 01:32:34.460]   119,754 Bitcoin were stolen after a hacker breached Bitfinex and initiated more than
[01:32:34.460 --> 01:32:36.700]   2000 unauthorized transactions.
[01:32:36.700 --> 01:32:43.740]   Prosecutors said the Bitcoin was sent to a digital wallet controlled by Lichtenstein.
[01:32:43.740 --> 01:32:47.740]   So by the way, important note, you're not anonymous.
[01:32:49.420 --> 01:32:55.340]   And Bitcoin, if they could figure out who's wallets, who's at the time, it was only worth $71 million.
[01:32:55.340 --> 01:32:57.820]   But it's now worth a lot more.
[01:32:57.820 --> 01:33:01.740]   Are you going to play her really valuable artistry?
[01:33:01.740 --> 01:33:02.380]   Yes.
[01:33:02.380 --> 01:33:06.380]   Federal officials say they were able to seize about 94,000 of the stolen Bitcoin,
[01:33:06.380 --> 01:33:07.900]   now worth $3.6 billion.
[01:33:07.900 --> 01:33:09.180]   That's not the entirety, though.
[01:33:09.180 --> 01:33:13.260]   It's the largest seizure of funds and justice department history.
[01:33:13.260 --> 01:33:16.780]   But yeah, her story is kind of interesting.
[01:33:17.420 --> 01:33:23.020]   He's a tech entrepreneur who goes by the nickname Dutch with US and Russian citizenship.
[01:33:23.020 --> 01:33:24.940]   He calls himself an angel investor.
[01:33:24.940 --> 01:33:32.940]   Morgan is a part-time rapper who also wrote prolifically, apparently, for Forbes.
[01:33:32.940 --> 01:33:38.140]   And in some cases, wrote articles about how to secure your Bitcoin investments.
[01:33:38.140 --> 01:33:41.100]   This gets better.
[01:33:41.100 --> 01:33:42.060]   Which you're probably low-written.
[01:33:42.060 --> 01:33:44.380]   This is made for a Netflix documentary.
[01:33:44.380 --> 01:33:47.660]   This pulls, it feels like it's not even real.
[01:33:47.660 --> 01:33:50.060]   It's just fake.
[01:33:50.060 --> 01:33:52.060]   Should I play some of her?
[01:33:52.060 --> 01:33:52.860]   I don't know.
[01:33:52.860 --> 01:33:53.580]   Is it safe?
[01:33:53.580 --> 01:33:54.060]   I don't know.
[01:33:54.060 --> 01:33:55.980]   Probably not.
[01:33:55.980 --> 01:33:59.740]   She's a performance artist, a rapper.
[01:33:59.740 --> 01:34:03.580]   And Forbes columnist.
[01:34:03.580 --> 01:34:07.740]   She says it all about Forbes.
[01:34:07.740 --> 01:34:09.980]   There's a rainbow resume right there.
[01:34:09.980 --> 01:34:16.460]   Her writing.
[01:34:16.460 --> 01:34:17.820]   Yeah, big difference.
[01:34:17.820 --> 01:34:22.620]   Well, it's funny because the thing is there's the Forbes contributor network,
[01:34:22.620 --> 01:34:24.460]   which basically you buy your way into, right?
[01:34:24.460 --> 01:34:26.620]   And then there's the journalistic part of Forbes,
[01:34:26.620 --> 01:34:27.900]   which is still good.
[01:34:27.900 --> 01:34:32.620]   I mean, I thought, but you can't tell who wrote what, really.
[01:34:32.620 --> 01:34:33.260]   That's the problem.
[01:34:33.260 --> 01:34:33.900]   And so it's all.
[01:34:33.900 --> 01:34:34.860]   Yeah.
[01:34:34.860 --> 01:34:36.700]   And I would not write for, I mean,
[01:34:36.700 --> 01:34:39.020]   not that Forbes ever was like Stacy, we must have you.
[01:34:39.020 --> 01:34:42.060]   But I don't think I'd work in a place that was so confusing.
[01:34:42.060 --> 01:34:44.940]   Morgan's rap name is Razzlecon.
[01:34:44.940 --> 01:34:52.220]   The pair has strongly proclaimed their innocence
[01:34:52.220 --> 01:34:54.140]   during a New York court appearance on Tuesday.
[01:34:54.140 --> 01:35:04.380]   They say it was a scyop to make us look stupid for being hacked by the most
[01:35:04.380 --> 01:35:06.620]   inept criminals on earth.
[01:35:06.620 --> 01:35:08.220]   What, wait a minute, I don't understand.
[01:35:09.020 --> 01:35:14.460]   Anyway, Morgan has a prolific presence on social media
[01:35:14.460 --> 01:35:18.620]   where you can find TikToks showcasing art pieces inspired by her
[01:35:18.620 --> 01:35:23.820]   synesthesia and her weird music videos.
[01:35:23.820 --> 01:35:26.460]   Let me see if I find some of the TikToks.
[01:35:26.460 --> 01:35:27.260]   We like TikToks.
[01:35:27.260 --> 01:35:29.100]   Is that where you see colors?
[01:35:29.100 --> 01:35:30.220]   That's right.
[01:35:30.220 --> 01:35:30.700]   Very good.
[01:35:30.700 --> 01:35:35.820]   She wrote articles like in 2017,
[01:35:35.820 --> 01:35:38.140]   should your company worry about getting blacklisted?
[01:35:38.140 --> 01:35:43.500]   And in 2020, experts share tips to protect your business from cyber criminals.
[01:35:43.500 --> 01:35:47.660]   You like us.
[01:35:47.660 --> 01:35:49.900]   Apparently she wrote for Inc Magazine as well.
[01:35:49.900 --> 01:35:51.420]   I agree.
[01:35:51.420 --> 01:35:55.100]   Well, Stacy, this is clearly a script for Netflix studios.
[01:35:55.100 --> 01:35:55.340]   Yeah.
[01:35:55.340 --> 01:36:00.700]   Here's a picture of her with a holding, unaccountably holding a giant wrench.
[01:36:00.700 --> 01:36:04.700]   It's like, it's a crescent wrench.
[01:36:05.180 --> 01:36:06.460]   I mean, yay?
[01:36:06.460 --> 01:36:07.900]   It's my favorite kind of wrench.
[01:36:07.900 --> 01:36:08.860]   You might be doing some plumbing.
[01:36:08.860 --> 01:36:09.340]   I don't know.
[01:36:09.340 --> 01:36:10.300]   It's pipe wrench.
[01:36:10.300 --> 01:36:15.580]   So Inc, she writes for Inc and Forbes.
[01:36:15.580 --> 01:36:17.660]   So there you go.
[01:36:17.660 --> 01:36:18.780]   There you go.
[01:36:18.780 --> 01:36:26.220]   But the good news is, the money has been repatriated.
[01:36:26.220 --> 01:36:31.260]   I imagine they were holding other people's wallets at Bitfinex.
[01:36:31.260 --> 01:36:32.700]   And so other people lost money.
[01:36:32.700 --> 01:36:33.340]   I don't know.
[01:36:33.340 --> 01:36:35.420]   Did they get money or did they get the coins back?
[01:36:35.420 --> 01:36:38.620]   Well, they haven't decided yet.
[01:36:38.620 --> 01:36:39.580]   They just rest to them.
[01:36:39.580 --> 01:36:41.420]   So they're going to have to wait until the difference.
[01:36:41.420 --> 01:36:41.980]   What's the difference?
[01:36:41.980 --> 01:36:45.980]   Well, because if like at the coins, if they got the coins at the valuation,
[01:36:45.980 --> 01:36:47.500]   that they were stolen.
[01:36:47.500 --> 01:36:51.420]   So if they get the coins back, then that's today's valuation.
[01:36:51.420 --> 01:36:52.620]   They just got money back.
[01:36:52.620 --> 01:36:53.180]   Oh, yeah.
[01:36:53.180 --> 01:36:53.740]   Yeah.
[01:36:53.740 --> 01:36:55.260]   No, I think that's why I was curious.
[01:36:55.260 --> 01:36:55.500]   Yeah.
[01:36:55.500 --> 01:36:58.540]   They got Bitcoin worth 3.6 billion.
[01:36:58.540 --> 01:36:58.780]   Yeah.
[01:36:58.780 --> 01:36:58.860]   Yeah.
[01:36:58.860 --> 01:36:59.340]   Yeah.
[01:36:59.340 --> 01:36:59.820]   Got it.
[01:36:59.820 --> 01:36:59.980]   Okay.
[01:36:59.980 --> 01:37:00.460]   Today.
[01:37:00.460 --> 01:37:00.620]   Yeah.
[01:37:00.620 --> 01:37:02.060]   You steal my Rembrandt.
[01:37:02.060 --> 01:37:04.700]   And 20 years later, you give me the value over 20 years before.
[01:37:04.700 --> 01:37:05.740]   No, you can remember that back.
[01:37:05.740 --> 01:37:08.460]   Unless it's an NFT, in which you get nothing.
[01:37:08.460 --> 01:37:14.780]   Did you get the pride of being able to tweet about your NFT?
[01:37:14.780 --> 01:37:16.460]   I'm stolen.
[01:37:16.460 --> 01:37:20.460]   Any more stones you want to throw, Mr. Jarvis?
[01:37:20.460 --> 01:37:20.860]   Sorry.
[01:37:20.860 --> 01:37:21.020]   Yeah.
[01:37:21.020 --> 01:37:21.660]   I couldn't make it.
[01:37:21.660 --> 01:37:23.020]   You know, it's easy punchlines.
[01:37:23.020 --> 01:37:23.900]   You just can't resist.
[01:37:23.900 --> 01:37:24.300]   You know?
[01:37:24.300 --> 01:37:25.740]   Good news.
[01:37:25.740 --> 01:37:30.060]   If you were worried about the IRS forcing you to use face ID
[01:37:30.060 --> 01:37:38.060]   with a third party private corporation, ID.me, they've decided to stop doing that.
[01:37:38.060 --> 01:37:42.300]   Ron Wyden wrote a minute saying, what's going on?
[01:37:42.300 --> 01:37:43.180]   What are you thinking?
[01:37:43.180 --> 01:37:44.220]   What are you thinking?
[01:37:44.220 --> 01:37:50.300]   He published a statement saying the Treasury Department has made the smart decision to direct
[01:37:50.300 --> 01:37:56.140]   the IRS to transition away from using the controversial ID.me verification service.
[01:37:56.140 --> 01:38:02.220]   As I requested earlier today, I understand the transition process may take time, but I appreciate
[01:38:02.220 --> 01:38:07.980]   the administration recognizes that privacy and security are not mutually exclusive and no one
[01:38:07.980 --> 01:38:14.060]   should be forced to submit to facial recognition to access critical government services.
[01:38:14.060 --> 01:38:16.700]   Good on you, Ron Wyden.
[01:38:16.700 --> 01:38:20.940]   He's also put forth an algorithmic accountability bill that is quite nice.
[01:38:20.940 --> 01:38:22.860]   He's reputed forth.
[01:38:22.860 --> 01:38:28.700]   Right. I think the smartest part of technology goes person in the Senate.
[01:38:28.700 --> 01:38:31.100]   Well, he's pretty sharp.
[01:38:31.100 --> 01:38:33.420]   He's pretty sharp. He's pretty sharp. He creates Section 230.
[01:38:33.420 --> 01:38:33.820]   Yeah.
[01:38:33.820 --> 01:38:37.660]   And what's his name? Chris Segozian who works for him?
[01:38:37.660 --> 01:38:38.780]   You know, Chris, right?
[01:38:38.780 --> 01:38:39.100]   Yeah.
[01:38:39.100 --> 01:38:40.620]   He's hiring an immediate aid debt.
[01:38:40.620 --> 01:38:40.940]   Yeah.
[01:38:40.940 --> 01:38:42.060]   So why make you?
[01:38:42.060 --> 01:38:46.540]   I was hiring a new technology analyst for Wyden's office, which is one heck of a job.
[01:38:46.540 --> 01:38:47.740]   You can make it impact there.
[01:38:47.740 --> 01:38:47.980]   Good.
[01:38:47.980 --> 01:38:49.740]   Good. I wish we had more Joe Wyden's.
[01:38:49.740 --> 01:38:51.500]   Ron Wyden's?
[01:38:51.500 --> 01:38:52.060]   I don't know.
[01:38:52.060 --> 01:38:52.860]   I don't know.
[01:38:52.860 --> 01:38:53.580]   I was not just saying.
[01:38:53.580 --> 01:38:53.820]   What?
[01:38:53.820 --> 01:38:57.180]   I can have more juice, but it wouldn't be good.
[01:38:57.180 --> 01:38:58.780]   Ron Wyden's or a dime a dozen.
[01:38:58.780 --> 01:39:00.220]   If you can find a Joe Wyden.
[01:39:00.220 --> 01:39:01.420]   Yeah.
[01:39:01.420 --> 01:39:02.220]   They're even better.
[01:39:02.220 --> 01:39:03.180]   Yeah.
[01:39:03.180 --> 01:39:05.180]   They're rare, you know.
[01:39:05.180 --> 01:39:09.180]   I owe the Joe Wyden NFT and I'm telling you.
[01:39:09.180 --> 01:39:14.940]   No, and again, from Twitter, thanks to Twitter, it was one year ago today
[01:39:14.940 --> 01:39:19.580]   that lawyer Cat visited the hearing.
[01:39:19.580 --> 01:39:24.780]   And here's the, thanks to Judge Roy Ferguson, who's obviously very hip.
[01:39:24.780 --> 01:39:29.500]   Here is the final ending of the lawyer Cat hearing.
[01:39:29.500 --> 01:39:30.300]   I'm here live.
[01:39:30.300 --> 01:39:31.580]   That's not a cat.
[01:39:31.580 --> 01:39:34.540]   There's no laugh.
[01:39:34.540 --> 01:39:36.860]   I can see that.
[01:39:36.860 --> 01:39:44.700]   I think if you click the up arrow next to the start video or stop video button at the bottom,
[01:39:45.900 --> 01:39:47.900]   you'll see video settings.
[01:39:47.900 --> 01:39:56.700]   And I believe in video settings, you will see the video filters off.
[01:39:56.700 --> 01:39:58.780]   There's the judge that you can.
[01:39:58.780 --> 01:39:59.500]   Hey, judge.
[01:39:59.500 --> 01:40:00.300]   Come here.
[01:40:00.300 --> 01:40:00.860]   Come here.
[01:40:00.860 --> 01:40:02.940]   The judge is actually explaining zoom.
[01:40:02.940 --> 01:40:04.860]   There you go.
[01:40:04.860 --> 01:40:07.660]   I'm not a cat.
[01:40:07.660 --> 01:40:11.340]   Rod Puntan.
[01:40:11.340 --> 01:40:13.500]   I'm not a cat.
[01:40:14.700 --> 01:40:15.580]   That's a classic.
[01:40:15.580 --> 01:40:16.460]   One year ago.
[01:40:16.460 --> 01:40:21.340]   And it's amazing that the actual judge is posting this in violation of the
[01:40:21.340 --> 01:40:22.700]   own.
[01:40:22.700 --> 01:40:23.580]   No, it's not.
[01:40:23.580 --> 01:40:27.660]   It says, recording of this hearing or live stream is prohibited violation may constitute
[01:40:27.660 --> 01:40:28.540]   the judge.
[01:40:28.540 --> 01:40:31.260]   I guess if you're the judge, who's going to?
[01:40:31.260 --> 01:40:31.820]   Really?
[01:40:31.820 --> 01:40:32.540]   That matters?
[01:40:32.540 --> 01:40:34.460]   That makes a difference?
[01:40:34.460 --> 01:40:36.620]   No, I think to Ron Puntan, it does.
[01:40:36.620 --> 01:40:38.220]   He was very much.
[01:40:38.220 --> 01:40:39.260]   He judges that it's okay to.
[01:40:39.260 --> 01:40:41.100]   Judge says okay.
[01:40:41.100 --> 01:40:44.380]   Oh my gosh.
[01:40:44.380 --> 01:40:45.660]   That's so wonderful.
[01:40:45.660 --> 01:40:48.460]   And thank you for reposting that, Judge Ferguson.
[01:40:48.460 --> 01:40:49.020]   You're welcome.
[01:40:49.020 --> 01:40:53.420]   I'm sure the judge will have some sort of lawsuit coming their way.
[01:40:53.420 --> 01:40:54.220]   That's nice.
[01:40:54.220 --> 01:40:59.180]   See, I saw that on Twitter as I was doing my work for the show.
[01:40:59.180 --> 01:40:59.820]   Well, thank God.
[01:40:59.820 --> 01:41:00.860]   I don't have to look at it.
[01:41:00.860 --> 01:41:02.700]   I just let you do it, which is great.
[01:41:02.700 --> 01:41:04.300]   All right.
[01:41:04.300 --> 01:41:05.660]   Let's do we have a change along?
[01:41:05.660 --> 01:41:06.140]   I'm just great.
[01:41:06.140 --> 01:41:06.460]   Yes.
[01:41:06.460 --> 01:41:06.780]   Let's.
[01:41:06.780 --> 01:41:07.660]   Yeah, we did.
[01:41:07.660 --> 01:41:08.300]   Thank you, Jason.
[01:41:08.300 --> 01:41:10.140]   How or did you do this, Anne?
[01:41:10.140 --> 01:41:10.860]   Who did the change?
[01:41:10.860 --> 01:41:11.420]   Mr. Hall.
[01:41:11.420 --> 01:41:11.980]   Mr. Hall.
[01:41:11.980 --> 01:41:12.780]   Thank you, Mr. Hall.
[01:41:12.780 --> 01:41:13.820]   Ladies and gentlemen.
[01:41:13.820 --> 01:41:16.140]   I now give you the change log orchestra.
[01:41:16.140 --> 01:41:18.140]   The Google change log.
[01:41:18.140 --> 01:41:20.620]   Change log orchestra.
[01:41:20.620 --> 01:41:21.820]   Let's do they're good.
[01:41:21.820 --> 01:41:22.300]   They're good.
[01:41:22.300 --> 01:41:25.660]   They got a cattle drum and a couple of horns, but it's still an orchestra.
[01:41:25.660 --> 01:41:28.380]   Once they come in from outside and smoking, you know, they're going to do the work.
[01:41:28.380 --> 01:41:32.940]   I want somebody to put that on their resume.
[01:41:32.940 --> 01:41:35.500]   I was in the Google change log orchestra.
[01:41:35.500 --> 01:41:38.700]   Google adds journeys to Chrome.
[01:41:39.980 --> 01:41:45.820]   Journeys to Chrome, you could, in effect, resume your search
[01:41:45.820 --> 01:41:48.940]   by searching your history by topic.
[01:41:48.940 --> 01:41:51.500]   It's a vision called a rabbit holes.
[01:41:51.500 --> 01:41:52.860]   Rabbit hole is actually great.
[01:41:52.860 --> 01:41:57.500]   I mean, history is really kind of, I don't know about you, but I use history a lot.
[01:41:57.500 --> 01:41:58.700]   Trying to remember what was it?
[01:41:58.700 --> 01:41:59.420]   Where did I see that?
[01:41:59.420 --> 01:42:00.540]   Well, it's because we're old, Leo.
[01:42:00.540 --> 01:42:04.460]   Yeah, maybe journeys, a new feature in the Chrome desktop.
[01:42:04.460 --> 01:42:08.700]   It groups pages from your search history by topic or intent.
[01:42:09.260 --> 01:42:13.020]   Intent, providing more helpful user experience than just showing
[01:42:13.020 --> 01:42:14.780]   the chronological list.
[01:42:14.780 --> 01:42:18.700]   So here's an example to give on the search engine land.
[01:42:18.700 --> 01:42:22.540]   Based on activity related to travel, that's the topic.
[01:42:22.540 --> 01:42:26.540]   And then a bunch of history results with the word travel in them.
[01:42:26.540 --> 01:42:27.180]   I think that's good.
[01:42:27.180 --> 01:42:29.260]   That's good.
[01:42:29.260 --> 01:42:33.340]   You can either type a topic into your search bar and click resume your research.
[01:42:33.340 --> 01:42:38.780]   That's a generous way of saying, I know you forgot what you
[01:42:38.780 --> 01:42:39.500]   were saying.
[01:42:39.500 --> 01:42:40.300]   So let's help you.
[01:42:40.300 --> 01:42:43.180]   Or go to search history and show history.
[01:42:43.180 --> 01:42:44.540]   Casey and Anne, don't need to do that.
[01:42:44.540 --> 01:42:50.220]   You and I go, what was the user will then see a list based on activity related to
[01:42:50.220 --> 01:42:52.860]   whatever your query is that's pulled from the search history.
[01:42:52.860 --> 01:42:53.340]   It's nice.
[01:42:53.340 --> 01:42:56.380]   They announced it as an experiment.
[01:42:56.380 --> 01:43:00.460]   I didn't hear this, but they announced it as an experimental feature a few months ago.
[01:43:00.460 --> 01:43:04.540]   And now it is official, although optional.
[01:43:05.340 --> 01:43:09.020]   And it is limited to your device, does not synchronize.
[01:43:09.020 --> 01:43:11.980]   I got it.
[01:43:11.980 --> 01:43:17.260]   I think yesterday the February security patch has rolled out to the Google Pixel.
[01:43:17.260 --> 01:43:21.740]   Don't know if how important it is.
[01:43:21.740 --> 01:43:23.180]   It does say there are bug fixes.
[01:43:23.180 --> 01:43:29.020]   Which included stuff like Wi-Fi connectivity in Bluetooth.
[01:43:29.020 --> 01:43:29.260]   Good.
[01:43:29.260 --> 01:43:29.820]   Good.
[01:43:29.820 --> 01:43:31.100]   And I got it.
[01:43:31.100 --> 01:43:34.700]   I think it was Monday when I got it installed.
[01:43:35.420 --> 01:43:38.460]   And nope, still have that random Bluetooth drop.
[01:43:38.460 --> 01:43:39.180]   Oh sure.
[01:43:39.180 --> 01:43:40.780]   Well, I think it's Bluetooth.
[01:43:40.780 --> 01:43:42.220]   Honestly, I think that's Bluetooth.
[01:43:42.220 --> 01:43:43.100]   Bluetooth is horrible.
[01:43:43.100 --> 01:43:48.140]   But there are quite a few CVEs, vulnerabilities that were fixed.
[01:43:48.140 --> 01:43:51.020]   So you probably should deploy it as soon as possible.
[01:43:51.020 --> 01:43:54.220]   Incidentally, kudos to Samsung.
[01:43:54.220 --> 01:43:59.020]   When they announced the S22, they did announce that they were going to do,
[01:43:59.020 --> 01:44:01.100]   I think, four years of security updates.
[01:44:01.100 --> 01:44:01.900]   Yeah.
[01:44:01.900 --> 01:44:04.460]   So following in Google's footsteps,
[01:44:04.460 --> 01:44:05.580]   I think that's really important.
[01:44:05.580 --> 01:44:06.620]   Four is still not enough.
[01:44:06.620 --> 01:44:09.900]   But hey, it's better than nothing.
[01:44:09.900 --> 01:44:11.580]   It's better than what would be your idea.
[01:44:11.580 --> 01:44:15.100]   You were just saying, oh, Bozda car, it's six years old, screw him.
[01:44:15.100 --> 01:44:18.620]   And for the phone, you're saying four is not enough.
[01:44:18.620 --> 01:44:20.540]   Oh, I do a number.
[01:44:20.540 --> 01:44:21.740]   Five is a time.
[01:44:21.740 --> 01:44:23.420]   Five would be good.
[01:44:23.420 --> 01:44:25.420]   I six is a little too much, honestly.
[01:44:25.420 --> 01:44:31.660]   Because I think by then there's going to be stuff that you maybe can't fix with a software update.
[01:44:31.660 --> 01:44:32.700]   Six more phone.
[01:44:32.700 --> 01:44:33.260]   I don't know.
[01:44:33.260 --> 01:44:34.060]   Maybe that's just me.
[01:44:34.060 --> 01:44:34.860]   This is your old car.
[01:44:34.860 --> 01:44:36.060]   That's all it for.
[01:44:36.060 --> 01:44:39.740]   Car is a car is what we call a durable good, but a phone isn't.
[01:44:39.740 --> 01:44:41.260]   Yeah.
[01:44:41.260 --> 01:44:46.620]   I wonder about phones that are five plus five plus years old and just how good are they
[01:44:46.620 --> 01:44:47.660]   function in any way?
[01:44:47.660 --> 01:44:51.660]   If even if they are patched up from a security standpoint,
[01:44:51.660 --> 01:44:54.140]   just are people still using phones that old?
[01:44:54.140 --> 01:44:55.740]   Well, that's yeah.
[01:44:55.740 --> 01:44:58.540]   Some people obviously are because they yeah, absolutely.
[01:44:58.540 --> 01:45:01.420]   I mean, I hear from people all the time have really holds the phones.
[01:45:02.540 --> 01:45:04.860]   You know, iPhone sixes or, you know,
[01:45:04.860 --> 01:45:09.500]   and I ask that because they're given away phones a lot of times.
[01:45:09.500 --> 01:45:09.980]   You know, I have my time.
[01:45:09.980 --> 01:45:10.940]   Well, that's my advice.
[01:45:10.940 --> 01:45:14.780]   People call the radio show because, you know, they're turning off 3G.
[01:45:14.780 --> 01:45:16.700]   In fact, 222.
[01:45:16.700 --> 01:45:20.300]   I think it's T-Mobile's turning off 3G.
[01:45:20.300 --> 01:45:25.020]   And so a lot of phones, even if they have LTE for data,
[01:45:25.020 --> 01:45:28.540]   but if they use 3G for signaling, there's a lot of fun.
[01:45:28.540 --> 01:45:30.780]   Surprisingly, recent phones that won't work anymore.
[01:45:30.780 --> 01:45:31.260]   Right.
[01:45:31.260 --> 01:45:31.740]   Right.
[01:45:31.740 --> 01:45:32.140]   So.
[01:45:32.140 --> 01:45:35.900]   Yeah, because for when 4G launched, they didn't have voice over 4G.
[01:45:35.900 --> 01:45:36.460]   They had to do.
[01:45:36.460 --> 01:45:40.860]   So yeah, but those are, I mean, that was a long time ago.
[01:45:40.860 --> 01:45:42.220]   But yeah, people are still using it.
[01:45:42.220 --> 01:45:44.860]   I mean, I just got my 3G modem replaced in my car.
[01:45:44.860 --> 01:45:47.100]   Yeah, that's actually where you see a lot of them.
[01:45:47.100 --> 01:45:52.300]   So T-Mobile says it's going to finish shutting down sprints,
[01:45:52.300 --> 01:45:54.300]   CDMA network, March 31st.
[01:45:54.300 --> 01:45:56.460]   4G network.
[01:45:56.460 --> 01:45:57.340]   CDMA is.
[01:45:57.340 --> 01:45:58.220]   Wow.
[01:45:58.220 --> 01:45:58.700]   Wow.
[01:45:58.700 --> 01:46:00.460]   The small home speed money.
[01:46:00.460 --> 01:46:01.020]   The small home speed money.
[01:46:01.020 --> 01:46:02.220]   The small home speed money money.
[01:46:02.220 --> 01:46:04.620]   Yeah, I mean, these are all, yeah, because these are, you know,
[01:46:04.620 --> 01:46:08.300]   it's expensive to run these extra towers.
[01:46:08.300 --> 01:46:12.940]   So AT&T is going off February, this month, 222.
[01:46:12.940 --> 01:46:15.740]   And Verizon said end of the year.
[01:46:15.740 --> 01:46:18.700]   But there's a lot of phones in cars and other things with 3G
[01:46:18.700 --> 01:46:19.820]   that won't work.
[01:46:19.820 --> 01:46:21.340]   A lot of old alarm systems.
[01:46:21.340 --> 01:46:26.380]   I wrote about it probably a year or two ago for my podcast or for Stacey and IT.
[01:46:27.260 --> 01:46:32.620]   Your alarm company should have been sending you things to like get you to upgrade,
[01:46:32.620 --> 01:46:37.500]   like incentives to get you to upgrade, but some people will be caught unawares.
[01:46:37.500 --> 01:46:42.460]   Medical devices, tablets, smart watches, vehicle SOS services, home security systems,
[01:46:42.460 --> 01:46:44.620]   and other connected products could be affected.
[01:46:44.620 --> 01:46:47.980]   That wasn't in the changelog, but that's a big deal.
[01:46:47.980 --> 01:46:48.620]   Pay attention.
[01:46:48.620 --> 01:46:48.860]   Yeah.
[01:46:48.860 --> 01:46:54.620]   Google's latest Pixel 6 update, the one in the February patch breaks some things.
[01:46:56.060 --> 01:46:58.620]   Some owners say Wi-Fi is randomly shutting off.
[01:46:58.620 --> 01:47:03.580]   So, or Bluetooth.
[01:47:03.580 --> 01:47:04.460]   Or Bluetooth.
[01:47:04.460 --> 01:47:08.940]   So, but you know, you fix a thing, you break a thing.
[01:47:08.940 --> 01:47:09.980]   It's the way of the world.
[01:47:09.980 --> 01:47:13.420]   Some things fix some things broken.
[01:47:13.420 --> 01:47:13.900]   Is it?
[01:47:13.900 --> 01:47:17.100]   I mean, before we got to like everything software.
[01:47:17.100 --> 01:47:18.780]   Yeah.
[01:47:18.780 --> 01:47:20.620]   Thank you.
[01:47:20.620 --> 01:47:24.940]   You know, okay, our dishwasher, we keep breaking dishwashers.
[01:47:25.740 --> 01:47:29.980]   We are on our third dishwasher in eight years, nine years.
[01:47:29.980 --> 01:47:30.940]   We moved into my third year.
[01:47:30.940 --> 01:47:31.900]   Oh, I heard a story about this.
[01:47:31.900 --> 01:47:32.940]   Yeah.
[01:47:32.940 --> 01:47:34.700]   Oh, yeah, Lisa's probably two.
[01:47:34.700 --> 01:47:37.900]   So, the last dishwasher.
[01:47:37.900 --> 01:47:39.580]   She's quite colorful.
[01:47:39.580 --> 01:47:40.780]   Ten people came out.
[01:47:40.780 --> 01:47:42.700]   I mean, literally couldn't fix it.
[01:47:42.700 --> 01:47:45.980]   Finally, one guy who comes out with diagnostic tools,
[01:47:45.980 --> 01:47:47.500]   says, "Oh, yeah, all those circuit boards are fried.
[01:47:47.500 --> 01:47:48.380]   Replaces them.
[01:47:48.380 --> 01:47:49.500]   Dishwasher works fine."
[01:47:49.500 --> 01:47:53.420]   Dies later, we replace it with, I think it's a kitchen aid.
[01:47:54.460 --> 01:47:55.180]   Ooh.
[01:47:55.180 --> 01:47:58.940]   Some guy comes out who is kind of not the sharpest tool.
[01:47:58.940 --> 01:48:03.340]   That's not what she said.
[01:48:03.340 --> 01:48:08.780]   He looks at it and he touches the motor, feels fine.
[01:48:08.780 --> 01:48:12.220]   And then says, "Yeah, these fine.
[01:48:12.220 --> 01:48:13.820]   And let me know if it doesn't work."
[01:48:13.820 --> 01:48:15.500]   And then it doesn't work.
[01:48:15.500 --> 01:48:16.780]   It feels fine.
[01:48:16.780 --> 01:48:17.500]   It feels fine.
[01:48:17.500 --> 01:48:18.460]   He felt it.
[01:48:18.460 --> 01:48:23.340]   It doesn't wash your whisperer.
[01:48:23.980 --> 01:48:25.180]   It doesn't work.
[01:48:25.180 --> 01:48:28.780]   And then, so we got the extended warranty.
[01:48:28.780 --> 01:48:30.220]   It's only a year and some months old,
[01:48:30.220 --> 01:48:31.340]   but we got the extended warranty.
[01:48:31.340 --> 01:48:35.580]   And we called and said, "Yeah, no, he didn't fix it.
[01:48:35.580 --> 01:48:37.180]   We keep getting parts in the mail."
[01:48:37.180 --> 01:48:41.580]   But then they said, "We can't find anybody to fix it."
[01:48:41.580 --> 01:48:43.260]   What?
[01:48:43.260 --> 01:48:46.460]   We don't have anybody else.
[01:48:46.460 --> 01:48:46.860]   That's it.
[01:48:46.860 --> 01:48:47.420]   He's the guy.
[01:48:47.420 --> 01:48:51.020]   And so Lisa tries calling somebody else.
[01:48:51.020 --> 01:48:54.380]   You know, and they said, "Yeah, we could fix it in a year."
[01:48:54.380 --> 01:48:56.060]   A year.
[01:48:56.060 --> 01:48:57.500]   She's.
[01:48:57.500 --> 01:48:57.980]   A year.
[01:48:57.980 --> 01:48:58.860]   We booked out.
[01:48:58.860 --> 01:48:59.900]   We booked out a year.
[01:48:59.900 --> 01:49:02.060]   Maybe it's, I don't know what it is.
[01:49:02.060 --> 01:49:04.140]   No, it's not a supply chain issue.
[01:49:04.140 --> 01:49:06.380]   It's a service technician issue.
[01:49:06.380 --> 01:49:07.980]   I don't know if you've noticed this in bed, man.
[01:49:07.980 --> 01:49:09.340]   Well, let me tell you.
[01:49:09.340 --> 01:49:11.900]   The Maytag repairman used to be very popular
[01:49:11.900 --> 01:49:13.980]   and then he became quite ignored.
[01:49:13.980 --> 01:49:16.380]   Yeah, maybe they all retired.
[01:49:16.380 --> 01:49:20.700]   Do you have a hard time getting handyman plumbers, technicians,
[01:49:20.700 --> 01:49:21.340]   things like that?
[01:49:21.340 --> 01:49:22.380]   Do you have a hard time getting them?
[01:49:22.380 --> 01:49:24.460]   We can't get any.
[01:49:24.460 --> 01:49:24.780]   Yes.
[01:49:24.780 --> 01:49:30.620]   It's both a retirement issue and a lack of recruitment
[01:49:30.620 --> 01:49:31.500]   coming in from some people.
[01:49:31.500 --> 01:49:32.700]   It's a great resignation.
[01:49:32.700 --> 01:49:33.500]   I don't know.
[01:49:33.500 --> 01:49:40.540]   And then people had money from their COVID fees, not fees,
[01:49:40.540 --> 01:49:40.940]   whatever.
[01:49:40.940 --> 01:49:43.420]   And so they invested in the improvement.
[01:49:43.420 --> 01:49:44.460]   This is a shame.
[01:49:44.460 --> 01:49:47.100]   People are not going into the trades anymore.
[01:49:47.100 --> 01:49:48.540]   I agree.
[01:49:48.540 --> 01:49:48.940]   Yes.
[01:49:48.940 --> 01:49:50.220]   Yes.
[01:49:51.100 --> 01:49:51.580]   Yes.
[01:49:51.580 --> 01:49:51.900]   Anyway.
[01:49:51.900 --> 01:49:55.020]   We're all like, and what are we going to do about that?
[01:49:55.020 --> 01:49:56.140]   We're hand washing dishes.
[01:49:56.140 --> 01:49:57.100]   That's all there is to it.
[01:49:57.100 --> 01:49:58.060]   [laughter]
[01:49:58.060 --> 01:50:01.340]   Um, Lisa's, okay, she's now gone to the insurance,
[01:50:01.340 --> 01:50:02.940]   you know, the third party.
[01:50:02.940 --> 01:50:04.860]   I always, I never buy third party insurance.
[01:50:04.860 --> 01:50:07.420]   She's going to them and she's saying,
[01:50:07.420 --> 01:50:08.460]   okay, now what are you going to do?
[01:50:08.460 --> 01:50:09.500]   You're going to get some new dishwasher
[01:50:09.500 --> 01:50:11.500]   because we are now without a dishwasher.
[01:50:11.500 --> 01:50:14.780]   And we have parts, we've set us parts.
[01:50:14.780 --> 01:50:16.540]   [laughter]
[01:50:16.540 --> 01:50:17.180]   We have parts.
[01:50:17.180 --> 01:50:19.660]   I'm sure there's a YouTube video on how to fix it.
[01:50:19.660 --> 01:50:20.860]   Oh, I already tried that.
[01:50:20.860 --> 01:50:21.340]   I do.
[01:50:21.340 --> 01:50:22.220]   Oh, I tried that.
[01:50:22.220 --> 01:50:24.220]   Is there a button on the dishwasher?
[01:50:24.220 --> 01:50:25.340]   This says go to terminal?
[01:50:25.340 --> 01:50:26.140]   [laughter]
[01:50:26.140 --> 01:50:27.340]   I could do it in the terminal.
[01:50:27.340 --> 01:50:28.060]   [laughter]
[01:50:28.060 --> 01:50:30.620]   If I had the dishwasher off again and on again.
[01:50:30.620 --> 01:50:32.540]   But, but so with this, I think it was a,
[01:50:32.540 --> 01:50:35.260]   she says a GE.
[01:50:35.260 --> 01:50:35.900]   I think it was a GE.
[01:50:35.900 --> 01:50:38.860]   There was, uh, there was diagnostic tools.
[01:50:38.860 --> 01:50:39.980]   Like, you know, you go to a garage
[01:50:39.980 --> 01:50:40.940]   and they plug in your car.
[01:50:40.940 --> 01:50:41.420]   Yeah.
[01:50:41.420 --> 01:50:41.900]   Yeah.
[01:50:41.900 --> 01:50:44.620]   Is that true for all appliances these days or?
[01:50:44.620 --> 01:50:45.740]   Yes.
[01:50:45.740 --> 01:50:48.140]   Most appliances, even those that aren't connected,
[01:50:48.140 --> 01:50:50.060]   will have some sort of diagnostic.
[01:50:50.060 --> 01:50:50.940]   They're all computer.
[01:50:50.940 --> 01:50:52.620]   They all have boards running them, right?
[01:50:52.620 --> 01:50:53.500]   They all have computers.
[01:50:53.500 --> 01:50:54.460]   Yeah.
[01:50:54.460 --> 01:50:57.820]   And the problem is this guy doesn't have this tool,
[01:50:57.820 --> 01:50:59.500]   so he has to put his hand on the thing.
[01:50:59.500 --> 01:51:03.020]   I just need to find somebody who has the tool
[01:51:03.020 --> 01:51:03.900]   who can say what's wrong.
[01:51:03.900 --> 01:51:05.900]   And then we'll know which of the many parts
[01:51:05.900 --> 01:51:08.220]   they have sent us to install.
[01:51:08.220 --> 01:51:10.300]   Oh, man.
[01:51:10.300 --> 01:51:12.700]   Unfortunately, it might be a part that's in short supply.
[01:51:12.700 --> 01:51:13.740]   Like, that's the issue.
[01:51:13.740 --> 01:51:15.500]   Like, my dad's, he,
[01:51:15.500 --> 01:51:17.180]   they fried the circuit boards in their fridge
[01:51:17.180 --> 01:51:20.780]   and unfortunately, there's a chip shortage out there.
[01:51:20.780 --> 01:51:21.740]   All right, you get.
[01:51:21.740 --> 01:51:22.620]   Oh, interesting.
[01:51:22.620 --> 01:51:24.140]   Oh, wow.
[01:51:24.140 --> 01:51:24.780]   Okay.
[01:51:24.780 --> 01:51:25.500]   Wow.
[01:51:25.500 --> 01:51:28.060]   We've uncovered a, uh, part, another problem.
[01:51:28.060 --> 01:51:30.540]   My dad's a, my dad's a doubly, so he's like,
[01:51:30.540 --> 01:51:31.180]   what's he doing?
[01:51:31.180 --> 01:51:33.260]   Maybe I could just play with the board and, uh,
[01:51:33.260 --> 01:51:33.820]   yeah.
[01:51:33.820 --> 01:51:34.220]   Yeah.
[01:51:34.220 --> 01:51:36.780]   I'm not afraid to use it.
[01:51:36.780 --> 01:51:36.940]   Yeah.
[01:51:36.940 --> 01:51:39.900]   We're all going to be in the metaverse
[01:51:39.900 --> 01:51:41.820]   without any refrigerators or dishwashers.
[01:51:41.820 --> 01:51:42.620]   And we'll be happy.
[01:51:42.620 --> 01:51:43.740]   Dystopia, right?
[01:51:43.740 --> 01:51:44.220]   Right.
[01:51:44.220 --> 01:51:46.220]   You'll have a fridge or a dishwasher.
[01:51:46.220 --> 01:51:48.540]   But you'll have to, yeah, you'll have a little tube that you suck.
[01:51:48.540 --> 01:51:52.220]   Well, what happens when the metaverse breaks?
[01:51:52.220 --> 01:51:53.500]   That's what I'm thinking.
[01:51:53.500 --> 01:51:56.860]   Pixel three and three XL, this is your final update,
[01:51:56.860 --> 01:51:58.380]   this February security patch.
[01:51:58.380 --> 01:51:59.740]   That's it.
[01:51:59.740 --> 01:52:00.380]   It's over.
[01:52:00.380 --> 01:52:01.420]   So.
[01:52:01.420 --> 01:52:03.980]   No, that's what I gave my daughter.
[01:52:03.980 --> 01:52:06.220]   This February?
[01:52:06.220 --> 01:52:07.660]   Today, the one you just got.
[01:52:07.660 --> 01:52:09.580]   It's out of a biscuit.
[01:52:09.580 --> 01:52:09.980]   All right.
[01:52:09.980 --> 01:52:11.980]   I'm going to get her a different phone.
[01:52:11.980 --> 01:52:12.540]   Uh huh.
[01:52:12.540 --> 01:52:15.260]   You know, I've got this fine folding phone, she might enjoy.
[01:52:15.260 --> 01:52:15.820]   Oh, that's true.
[01:52:15.820 --> 01:52:17.340]   I'll give her my five if I get this full.
[01:52:17.340 --> 01:52:19.900]   Oh, we're going to get a FedEx is to you right away.
[01:52:19.900 --> 01:52:20.940]   Get this to you stat.
[01:52:20.940 --> 01:52:22.460]   Pronto.
[01:52:22.460 --> 01:52:24.380]   Well, she's good for another month, at least.
[01:52:24.380 --> 01:52:26.940]   But I'll, well, we'll get this to you right away.
[01:52:26.940 --> 01:52:28.380]   It's in perfect condition.
[01:52:28.380 --> 01:52:31.500]   I'll even include, I'll throw it at no additional charge.
[01:52:31.500 --> 01:52:34.060]   The handy dandy leather case that goes on.
[01:52:34.060 --> 01:52:35.420]   There's a case on that thing.
[01:52:35.420 --> 01:52:35.980]   Yeah.
[01:52:35.980 --> 01:52:37.340]   Yeah.
[01:52:37.340 --> 01:52:40.300]   You want the case because otherwise you're bareback in it.
[01:52:40.300 --> 01:52:40.940]   It's not good.
[01:52:40.940 --> 01:52:43.900]   Lee, why don't I just send you money for it?
[01:52:43.900 --> 01:52:45.100]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:52:45.100 --> 01:52:45.500]   I insist.
[01:52:45.500 --> 01:52:45.900]   I don't mind.
[01:52:45.900 --> 01:52:47.420]   I don't mind.
[01:52:47.420 --> 01:52:48.060]   I really don't.
[01:52:48.060 --> 01:52:49.420]   I tried to get money for it.
[01:52:49.420 --> 01:52:51.580]   Samsung was going to give me $350 for it.
[01:52:51.580 --> 01:52:53.180]   But then, you know, nothing.
[01:52:53.180 --> 01:52:54.780]   So that's what we're having to say.
[01:52:54.780 --> 01:52:56.380]   Never mind the phone.
[01:52:56.380 --> 01:52:58.220]   Can you give me that cooking thing you like?
[01:52:58.220 --> 01:52:58.540]   No.
[01:52:58.540 --> 01:52:59.020]   Thermomics.
[01:52:59.020 --> 01:52:59.980]   There you go.
[01:52:59.980 --> 01:53:01.500]   So the problem without the case is,
[01:53:01.500 --> 01:53:03.020]   I don't, you probably can't see it.
[01:53:03.020 --> 01:53:06.300]   But it's kind of like a clothes pin that it doesn't bother you.
[01:53:06.300 --> 01:53:08.060]   It bothers me, but you put the case on it.
[01:53:08.060 --> 01:53:10.060]   It seals it all up.
[01:53:10.060 --> 01:53:12.940]   I have to put a case on all my phones because they, they just feel like,
[01:53:12.940 --> 01:53:15.500]   but, but they just slip right out of my little hands.
[01:53:15.500 --> 01:53:15.820]   Slick.
[01:53:15.820 --> 01:53:16.780]   Yeah, they're slippery.
[01:53:16.780 --> 01:53:19.420]   You're going to actually, I predict you're going to,
[01:53:19.420 --> 01:53:20.140]   you're going to flip.
[01:53:20.140 --> 01:53:21.820]   You're going to love this.
[01:53:21.820 --> 01:53:25.100]   You're going to love this phone, if I might quite a phrase.
[01:53:25.100 --> 01:53:25.820]   I think it's good.
[01:53:25.820 --> 01:53:26.460]   I really like it.
[01:53:26.460 --> 01:53:31.580]   If I didn't have all these other phones, I would be more interested.
[01:53:31.580 --> 01:53:37.100]   Android 12L, the hated version, beta three, coming now.
[01:53:37.100 --> 01:53:40.700]   If you want, if you're on the beta track for Pixel 6, Pixel 6 Pro,
[01:53:40.700 --> 01:53:41.980]   and you're on a 12L, right?
[01:53:42.860 --> 01:53:44.380]   No, I'm not doing beta.
[01:53:44.380 --> 01:53:45.180]   I was doing that.
[01:53:45.180 --> 01:53:45.660]   I was doing that.
[01:53:45.660 --> 01:53:47.900]   The dad gum production software doesn't work.
[01:53:47.900 --> 01:53:48.860]   Wow, I want the beta.
[01:53:48.860 --> 01:53:49.180]   Right.
[01:53:49.180 --> 01:53:52.060]   It's maybe, maybe Jason's on it.
[01:53:52.060 --> 01:53:52.380]   I don't know.
[01:53:52.380 --> 01:53:53.580]   I saw it.
[01:53:53.580 --> 01:53:54.300]   Probably Mr. Howe.
[01:53:54.300 --> 01:53:57.180]   That's something Jason was living on the edge in the Twig studio.
[01:53:57.180 --> 01:53:59.100]   Somebody's.
[01:53:59.100 --> 01:54:03.020]   And finally, the Google Chrome icon has been updated.
[01:54:03.020 --> 01:54:04.140]   I defy you.
[01:54:04.140 --> 01:54:08.700]   I defy you to tell the difference.
[01:54:09.260 --> 01:54:12.060]   Now, the old one you could tell, like that that's a 3D.
[01:54:12.060 --> 01:54:13.980]   That looks like a assignment, right?
[01:54:13.980 --> 01:54:16.940]   It's just a little lightly larger in the center, sir.
[01:54:16.940 --> 01:54:17.900]   Slightly larger.
[01:54:17.900 --> 01:54:18.940]   Slightly larger center.
[01:54:18.940 --> 01:54:21.660]   And I think there's a little gradient on the red
[01:54:21.660 --> 01:54:24.780]   to give it a little highlight, like the light shining on it.
[01:54:24.780 --> 01:54:28.140]   But boy, if you didn't see them exactly next to each other like this,
[01:54:28.140 --> 01:54:31.180]   even looking at next to each other, it hardly seems to.
[01:54:31.180 --> 01:54:35.420]   How many tests and focus groups and meetings did they go through to get that?
[01:54:35.420 --> 01:54:37.820]   Do you remember in the old days, Marissa Meyer,
[01:54:37.820 --> 01:54:39.740]   who was in charge of Google's front page?
[01:54:39.740 --> 01:54:44.460]   When their big product was searched, it's very adamant.
[01:54:44.460 --> 01:54:45.340]   You can't change it.
[01:54:45.340 --> 01:54:49.100]   It's got and she would go through all those focus groups about the colors and all that stuff.
[01:54:49.100 --> 01:54:50.540]   A/B testing.
[01:54:50.540 --> 01:54:51.020]   Enough focus.
[01:54:51.020 --> 01:54:51.980]   A/B testing.
[01:54:51.980 --> 01:54:52.940]   Oh, data.
[01:54:52.940 --> 01:54:53.820]   Real hard data.
[01:54:53.820 --> 01:54:57.980]   Now, I wish she'd come back as a search page is junked up like nothing.
[01:54:57.980 --> 01:54:59.660]   Look at all this crap.
[01:54:59.660 --> 01:55:03.340]   Yeah, it is like shopping on Amazon or going to a TJ Max store or something.
[01:55:03.340 --> 01:55:04.060]   Well, it's not that.
[01:55:04.060 --> 01:55:05.100]   I mean, it's a real crap experience.
[01:55:05.100 --> 01:55:06.140]   But there's a lot.
[01:55:06.140 --> 01:55:06.940]   There's a lot more.
[01:55:06.940 --> 01:55:11.020]   I mean, the carbon neutral since 2007, blah, blah, blah, lots of links.
[01:55:11.020 --> 01:55:13.500]   I still pretty spare compared to most.
[01:55:13.500 --> 01:55:14.380]   Compared to most.
[01:55:14.380 --> 01:55:14.860]   Compared to that.
[01:55:14.860 --> 01:55:15.340]   Yeah.
[01:55:15.340 --> 01:55:18.540]   And that is the Google change.
[01:55:18.540 --> 01:55:23.020]   That's one of the best change logs in a while.
[01:55:23.020 --> 01:55:23.500]   It was good.
[01:55:23.500 --> 01:55:25.980]   Thank you, Jason.
[01:55:25.980 --> 01:55:29.580]   Roblox, just we're talking about in-game purchases and how valuable they are.
[01:55:29.580 --> 01:55:37.580]   Half a billion dollars in 2021 in-game money going to people making creators,
[01:55:37.580 --> 01:55:38.940]   making stuff for Roblox.
[01:55:38.940 --> 01:55:40.220]   That is a big business.
[01:55:40.220 --> 01:55:42.220]   That is a big business.
[01:55:42.220 --> 01:55:45.900]   That's exactly what Meta is looking at is stuff like that.
[01:55:45.900 --> 01:55:46.380]   Yeah, sure.
[01:55:46.380 --> 01:55:47.260]   Oh, gosh, yeah.
[01:55:47.260 --> 01:55:53.580]   Oh, gosh, if we go, no, there's more.
[01:55:53.580 --> 01:55:56.380]   You don't learn to scroll.
[01:55:56.380 --> 01:55:57.580]   This is a very full show.
[01:55:57.580 --> 01:56:00.220]   Well, okay, I don't want to.
[01:56:00.220 --> 01:56:00.860]   We're not going to go to the show.
[01:56:00.860 --> 01:56:02.460]   He hates to scroll on the big machine.
[01:56:02.460 --> 01:56:03.260]   I don't like to scroll.
[01:56:03.260 --> 01:56:03.900]   He's a lot of them.
[01:56:03.900 --> 01:56:05.980]   He makes his wrist flop move.
[01:56:05.980 --> 01:56:08.460]   Oh, sorry.
[01:56:08.460 --> 01:56:12.220]   I don't want to.
[01:56:12.220 --> 01:56:14.380]   We talked about age verification and porn.
[01:56:14.380 --> 01:56:15.820]   Oh, we could talk about arm.
[01:56:15.820 --> 01:56:17.020]   Okay.
[01:56:17.020 --> 01:56:18.540]   So that's like moral panic.
[01:56:18.540 --> 01:56:19.900]   Age verification and porn.
[01:56:19.900 --> 01:56:21.740]   I can do it quickly.
[01:56:21.740 --> 01:56:23.580]   If you're in the UK and you're underage,
[01:56:23.580 --> 01:56:26.540]   you'll have to go to a bar and show me your ID
[01:56:26.540 --> 01:56:28.300]   to get into a porn site.
[01:56:28.300 --> 01:56:28.700]   That's all.
[01:56:28.700 --> 01:56:32.300]   If you're anybody and just wait for that data breach,
[01:56:32.300 --> 01:56:33.740]   just wait.
[01:56:33.740 --> 01:56:36.380]   If you think ID me was bad.
[01:56:36.380 --> 01:56:38.620]   Or as Johnson will be in there.
[01:56:38.620 --> 01:56:39.180]   Yeah.
[01:56:39.180 --> 01:56:41.980]   And actually, there's some talk about implementing that in the US.
[01:56:41.980 --> 01:56:44.940]   I can't imagine given that.
[01:56:44.940 --> 01:56:45.660]   Well, privacy.
[01:56:45.660 --> 01:56:47.820]   It's porn and apple pie here in America
[01:56:47.820 --> 01:56:50.300]   that they would do that.
[01:56:50.300 --> 01:56:51.500]   Yeah, privacy, big deal.
[01:56:51.500 --> 01:56:53.180]   But age verification.
[01:56:53.180 --> 01:56:55.740]   This has been going back and forth in the UK for some time.
[01:56:56.220 --> 01:56:57.420]   Now tell us about.
[01:56:57.420 --> 01:57:00.300]   There's a lot of planning ahead to look at porn.
[01:57:00.300 --> 01:57:01.980]   Exactly.
[01:57:01.980 --> 01:57:03.420]   No longer.
[01:57:03.420 --> 01:57:05.580]   No longer impulse.
[01:57:05.580 --> 01:57:08.140]   You know, you've got to go for the moment.
[01:57:08.140 --> 01:57:08.620]   No.
[01:57:08.620 --> 01:57:10.540]   Thursday is porn day around here.
[01:57:10.540 --> 01:57:14.540]   I'll find out to the pub.
[01:57:14.540 --> 01:57:15.660]   Get certified and.
[01:57:15.660 --> 01:57:20.620]   Let's do the Nvidia story there.
[01:57:20.620 --> 01:57:24.300]   They were trying to buy arm as funny as they first bid was
[01:57:24.300 --> 01:57:25.260]   like 20 billion.
[01:57:25.260 --> 01:57:28.700]   And then as the value of Nvidia stock kept going up,
[01:57:28.700 --> 01:57:31.420]   it ended up, I think, 42 billion dollars.
[01:57:31.420 --> 01:57:32.860]   At this point, a video might be going,
[01:57:32.860 --> 01:57:34.300]   whoo, we dodged a bullet.
[01:57:34.300 --> 01:57:37.660]   They've decided because of regulatory headwinds.
[01:57:37.660 --> 01:57:40.460]   That's the new word, by the way, in finance markets.
[01:57:40.460 --> 01:57:42.300]   Regulatory headwinds.
[01:57:42.300 --> 01:57:43.820]   They are not going to attempt to buy arm.
[01:57:43.820 --> 01:57:46.140]   They will have to pay more than a billion dollars
[01:57:46.140 --> 01:57:48.140]   in breakup fees to soft bank.
[01:57:48.140 --> 01:57:49.340]   The current owners,
[01:57:49.340 --> 01:57:51.740]   soft bank has decided to do an IPO
[01:57:51.740 --> 01:57:54.220]   because they want to they want to wash their hands of this thing.
[01:57:54.780 --> 01:57:55.020]   Yeah.
[01:57:55.020 --> 01:57:56.620]   What do you think, Stacy?
[01:57:56.620 --> 01:57:57.180]   Good, bad.
[01:57:57.180 --> 01:57:57.660]   You did it.
[01:57:57.660 --> 01:58:00.220]   No, it's totally reasonable.
[01:58:00.220 --> 01:58:03.980]   I mean, when your own customers are coming out against the deal
[01:58:03.980 --> 01:58:06.140]   and complaining to regulators that it's a bad idea,
[01:58:06.140 --> 01:58:08.700]   you probably shouldn't complete the deal.
[01:58:08.700 --> 01:58:12.700]   And so arm has to be an independent entity going forward.
[01:58:12.700 --> 01:58:13.340]   I mean, it's just.
[01:58:13.340 --> 01:58:15.420]   Yeah.
[01:58:15.420 --> 01:58:16.860]   Too many.
[01:58:16.860 --> 01:58:17.500]   Yeah.
[01:58:17.500 --> 01:58:19.580]   If any one company owned it,
[01:58:19.580 --> 01:58:23.660]   although, you know, I kind of had this evil, you know,
[01:58:24.300 --> 01:58:27.820]   genius thing about what would be so cool if arm and video were the same.
[01:58:27.820 --> 01:58:30.140]   And they could just do this amazing stuff.
[01:58:30.140 --> 01:58:31.420]   But you're absolutely right.
[01:58:31.420 --> 01:58:33.980]   It's bad for everybody else in the business.
[01:58:33.980 --> 01:58:37.900]   The next thing to look for, like, the reason why it would not be,
[01:58:37.900 --> 01:58:39.900]   I'll just play a little devil's advocate.
[01:58:39.900 --> 01:58:42.780]   Reason why this is silly and the deal should have gone through
[01:58:42.780 --> 01:58:46.060]   is because risk five is coming out hard and fast.
[01:58:46.060 --> 01:58:47.020]   Oh, I hope you're right.
[01:58:47.020 --> 01:58:49.580]   To compete on the instruction set side.
[01:58:49.580 --> 01:58:51.660]   In Intel this week, just said,
[01:58:51.660 --> 01:58:55.980]   hey, you know what, we are going to be all in on risk five.
[01:58:55.980 --> 01:58:58.380]   We're going to do a foundry partnership with sci-fi,
[01:58:58.380 --> 01:59:03.740]   which makes a chip configurator kind of thing for risk five chips.
[01:59:03.740 --> 01:59:05.740]   So you don't need to design your own if you don't want to.
[01:59:05.740 --> 01:59:09.260]   And we're even going to manufacture some arm chips.
[01:59:09.260 --> 01:59:12.140]   So, you know, if I were looking ahead,
[01:59:12.140 --> 01:59:15.260]   I would say to the RM IPO, sure, that needs to be done.
[01:59:15.260 --> 01:59:19.900]   But keep risks five in your kind of realer view.
[01:59:19.900 --> 01:59:23.740]   Because that's more open than what RM is doing
[01:59:23.740 --> 01:59:27.340]   when you think about RM being more open than the x86 license.
[01:59:27.340 --> 01:59:28.460]   I think of all the chip news.
[01:59:28.460 --> 01:59:33.100]   Correct me if I'm wrong, but I think if risk five is kind of like an open source chip architecture,
[01:59:33.100 --> 01:59:33.500]   right?
[01:59:33.500 --> 01:59:35.580]   It is an open source chip architecture.
[01:59:35.580 --> 01:59:37.340]   That is exactly what it is.
[01:59:37.340 --> 01:59:42.220]   But there are companies like sci-fi that are building ways to make it easier for like,
[01:59:42.220 --> 01:59:45.260]   I couldn't design a ship even with that.
[01:59:45.740 --> 01:59:50.140]   But like, I don't know if you try sci-fi site, you can go in and you're like,
[01:59:50.140 --> 01:59:53.100]   oh, I would like, you know, two L2 caches.
[01:59:53.100 --> 01:59:54.380]   I would like these ports.
[01:59:54.380 --> 01:59:58.700]   I would like this kind of core that processes Linux and something else.
[01:59:58.700 --> 02:00:01.260]   Kind of like what you do if you buy an arm license.
[02:00:01.260 --> 02:00:04.620]   I do, but you don't have to buy an arm license to do it.
[02:00:04.620 --> 02:00:05.180]   Yeah.
[02:00:05.180 --> 02:00:07.100]   Developed that you see Berkeley.
[02:00:07.100 --> 02:00:08.380]   It's not brand new.
[02:00:08.380 --> 02:00:09.580]   It's about 10 years old.
[02:00:09.580 --> 02:00:11.500]   I'll just see you in the chip world.
[02:00:11.500 --> 02:00:13.660]   It's a small instruction set, but risk five.
[02:00:14.220 --> 02:00:18.060]   The reason Intel likes this is because Intel has in effect become two companies.
[02:00:18.060 --> 02:00:23.100]   One, a design firm, continuing to make the X86 stuff they have already been making.
[02:00:23.100 --> 02:00:26.460]   The other, a foundry, they want a foundry business kind of like TSMC.
[02:00:26.460 --> 02:00:30.780]   And they want to build risk five chips.
[02:00:30.780 --> 02:00:34.940]   Risk five probably has a future though in some of the areas where,
[02:00:34.940 --> 02:00:39.500]   you know, we've seen these chip shortages, the legacy, not the big powerful chips and
[02:00:39.500 --> 02:00:42.860]   PCs and Macs, but the legacy nodes in a lot of devices.
[02:00:42.860 --> 02:00:43.820]   Risk five is...
[02:00:43.820 --> 02:00:44.940]   The big devices and stuff.
[02:00:44.940 --> 02:00:51.340]   I actually think where you're going to see risk five is so the big trend in computing
[02:00:51.340 --> 02:00:55.580]   is more single, not single purpose.
[02:00:55.580 --> 02:00:57.420]   It's not general purpose computing anymore, right?
[02:00:57.420 --> 02:00:57.740]   Yeah.
[02:00:57.740 --> 02:01:00.540]   We need to get the most performance per watt.
[02:01:00.540 --> 02:01:02.620]   You would see risk five stuff in IoT, you think?
[02:01:02.620 --> 02:01:05.660]   Yeah, there's actually companies building risk five for IoT.
[02:01:05.660 --> 02:01:11.580]   You see right now where it's most popular is like Western Digital and Vidya, Seagate.
[02:01:11.580 --> 02:01:16.060]   They all make risk five chips for governing their own like...
[02:01:16.060 --> 02:01:18.860]   Oh, so people are already making risk five processes.
[02:01:18.860 --> 02:01:19.420]   Oh, yeah.
[02:01:19.420 --> 02:01:20.380]   Oh, I didn't realize that.
[02:01:20.380 --> 02:01:22.300]   I thought we were just at the beginning of that.
[02:01:22.300 --> 02:01:26.220]   So they're performing and they work and people like them.
[02:01:26.220 --> 02:01:26.780]   Yeah.
[02:01:26.780 --> 02:01:27.340]   Okay.
[02:01:27.340 --> 02:01:28.300]   Yeah, people are...
[02:01:28.300 --> 02:01:29.900]   Now you're not seeing them today.
[02:01:29.900 --> 02:01:33.340]   I mean, they're the chips that control the chips on your boards, right?
[02:01:33.340 --> 02:01:38.620]   But they could be used for a huge...
[02:01:38.620 --> 02:01:41.260]   You can design something for a huge number of things.
[02:01:41.260 --> 02:01:43.900]   And that becomes really important because like,
[02:01:43.900 --> 02:01:46.780]   when you think about like a machine learning process, you're like,
[02:01:46.780 --> 02:01:49.500]   "Oh, what kind of neural network are you doing?
[02:01:49.500 --> 02:01:51.260]   Are you doing a convolutional neural network?
[02:01:51.260 --> 02:01:53.900]   Are you doing like a adversarial network?
[02:01:53.900 --> 02:01:56.860]   You know, let's optimize the hell out of a chip."
[02:01:56.860 --> 02:02:01.340]   And because you don't have to pay like the larger licensing fees,
[02:02:01.340 --> 02:02:05.980]   and because you can build it yourself and just ship it off to be manufactured,
[02:02:05.980 --> 02:02:07.580]   you get a lot more flexibility there.
[02:02:07.580 --> 02:02:10.780]   And so you're going to see this whole like opening.
[02:02:10.780 --> 02:02:12.380]   It's going to be really...
[02:02:12.380 --> 02:02:16.940]   I mean, if you're like me, it's really freaking cool.
[02:02:16.940 --> 02:02:21.100]   And if you're like you, maybe not.
[02:02:21.100 --> 02:02:23.100]   No, I'm actually very interested.
[02:02:23.100 --> 02:02:23.820]   I think it's great.
[02:02:23.820 --> 02:02:27.500]   Remember the fuss when Google announced,
[02:02:27.500 --> 02:02:30.460]   we're going to turn on two factor or two step,
[02:02:30.460 --> 02:02:33.340]   as they call it, verification for a bunch of people.
[02:02:33.340 --> 02:02:35.820]   And good luck.
[02:02:36.380 --> 02:02:40.140]   Well, Google says we turn it on for 150 million people,
[02:02:40.140 --> 02:02:44.620]   and it has led to a 50% decrease in compromised accounts.
[02:02:44.620 --> 02:02:45.660]   It's been a success.
[02:02:45.660 --> 02:02:51.980]   150 million people suddenly have two step of authentication.
[02:02:51.980 --> 02:02:53.340]   Maybe you're one of them.
[02:02:53.340 --> 02:02:56.780]   Of course, we've been saying for a long time,
[02:02:56.780 --> 02:02:58.940]   as has Google turn it on, turn it on.
[02:02:58.940 --> 02:03:01.500]   But I guess the difference is at this point.
[02:03:01.500 --> 02:03:03.100]   So they just did that for their test group.
[02:03:03.100 --> 02:03:05.100]   That's just how I read this, correct?
[02:03:05.100 --> 02:03:08.620]   This isn't something that was pushed out to everyone by default.
[02:03:08.620 --> 02:03:09.340]   No.
[02:03:09.340 --> 02:03:09.820]   No.
[02:03:09.820 --> 02:03:14.460]   They're going to continue auto enrollments in 2022.
[02:03:14.460 --> 02:03:20.540]   I'm not sure what qualifies you as an enrollee.
[02:03:20.540 --> 02:03:22.620]   It's 150 million people in that.
[02:03:22.620 --> 02:03:23.820]   And I'm like, test group.
[02:03:23.820 --> 02:03:25.580]   It's a big number for a test group.
[02:03:25.580 --> 02:03:32.140]   So I guess they're doing it judiciously,
[02:03:32.140 --> 02:03:35.340]   and this is the first result, which is it's worked,
[02:03:35.340 --> 02:03:36.940]   at least, to make people more secure.
[02:03:36.940 --> 02:03:40.620]   What I'd like to know is how many people got locked out of their accounts,
[02:03:40.620 --> 02:03:46.300]   how many people quit Google forever, how bad it was for the people who just didn't like it.
[02:03:46.300 --> 02:03:48.940]   I think Google's right to do it.
[02:03:48.940 --> 02:03:50.940]   And it does work.
[02:03:50.940 --> 02:03:53.020]   Good stuff.
[02:03:53.020 --> 02:03:57.020]   This is pretty, it's not onerous.
[02:03:57.020 --> 02:04:00.700]   It's the thing where you get the announcement for Google on your phone
[02:04:00.700 --> 02:04:03.740]   that you say, yeah, that was me and you're logged in.
[02:04:03.740 --> 02:04:04.620]   It's like single sign on.
[02:04:04.620 --> 02:04:07.500]   So it's not, you don't have to have an authenticator.
[02:04:07.500 --> 02:04:08.460]   You don't have to have it.
[02:04:08.460 --> 02:04:09.100]   It's not bad.
[02:04:09.100 --> 02:04:10.380]   It's actually, I love it.
[02:04:10.380 --> 02:04:13.260]   I've had it for a long time.
[02:04:13.260 --> 02:04:16.940]   In fact, it's funny because I was just trying to buy that Samsung phone
[02:04:16.940 --> 02:04:18.620]   in order to log into my Samsung account.
[02:04:18.620 --> 02:04:23.340]   They said, okay, we just sent a push notification to your Samsung phone.
[02:04:23.340 --> 02:04:24.300]   Everybody's doing it now.
[02:04:24.300 --> 02:04:25.900]   Apple does it too.
[02:04:25.900 --> 02:04:27.420]   So I think this is--
[02:04:27.420 --> 02:04:28.300]   So Shopify.
[02:04:28.300 --> 02:04:29.580]   Shopify does it?
[02:04:29.580 --> 02:04:29.900]   Yeah.
[02:04:29.900 --> 02:04:30.860]   I think that's good.
[02:04:30.860 --> 02:04:32.060]   And it's not a text message.
[02:04:32.060 --> 02:04:33.020]   That's the other thing.
[02:04:33.020 --> 02:04:35.100]   It's a push notification.
[02:04:35.100 --> 02:04:36.140]   It's not a text message.
[02:04:36.140 --> 02:04:39.260]   By the way, Stacey, look at the beautiful wallpapers you get
[02:04:39.260 --> 02:04:41.980]   with this Samsung Galaxy Flip 3.
[02:04:41.980 --> 02:04:45.980]   Can't wait.
[02:04:45.980 --> 02:04:53.580]   Meta is adding a personal boundary to your legless virtual avatar
[02:04:53.580 --> 02:04:58.700]   so that nobody can goose you to eliminate harassment.
[02:04:59.340 --> 02:05:02.380]   I don't think that's the kind of for us.
[02:05:02.380 --> 02:05:04.300]   I mean, that's fine, but that's not really the kind of--
[02:05:04.300 --> 02:05:06.140]   No, there were cases of people who--
[02:05:06.140 --> 02:05:07.900]   Close talkers?
[02:05:07.900 --> 02:05:12.620]   No, who got virtually assaulted.
[02:05:12.620 --> 02:05:14.780]   Women.
[02:05:14.780 --> 02:05:15.660]   Yeah, I've heard this.
[02:05:15.660 --> 02:05:21.020]   Anyway, there's a two-foot radius of virtual personal space.
[02:05:21.020 --> 02:05:24.780]   So there's an effect four feet between all avatars.
[02:05:24.780 --> 02:05:27.820]   It's that and virtual COVID doesn't get you to--
[02:05:27.820 --> 02:05:29.340]   You could get virtually groped.
[02:05:29.340 --> 02:05:30.380]   Is that what you're saying?
[02:05:30.380 --> 02:05:32.220]   But you're not because it's just--
[02:05:32.220 --> 02:05:33.260]   Okay.
[02:05:33.260 --> 02:05:35.500]   I know, but it was a way to represent.
[02:05:35.500 --> 02:05:36.620]   Right.
[02:05:36.620 --> 02:05:36.860]   Yeah.
[02:05:36.860 --> 02:05:37.660]   Well, it's a good--
[02:05:37.660 --> 02:05:39.740]   Pretend I'm talking to you about chips,
[02:05:39.740 --> 02:05:43.100]   and I'm really excited to tell you about arm and such assets.
[02:05:43.100 --> 02:05:45.020]   And you're like virtually grabbing my boobs.
[02:05:45.020 --> 02:05:46.460]   I'm going to be like, you know what?
[02:05:46.460 --> 02:05:47.420]   Yeah, no, you're right.
[02:05:47.420 --> 02:05:51.580]   Well, I think those people should just be kicked out entirely.
[02:05:51.580 --> 02:05:52.460]   Yeah.
[02:05:52.460 --> 02:05:57.100]   But if this helps, if this fixes it, that's good.
[02:05:57.100 --> 02:05:57.740]   Now--
[02:05:57.740 --> 02:05:58.620]   I mean, it'd be nice.
[02:05:58.620 --> 02:06:00.540]   I mean, because then--
[02:06:00.540 --> 02:06:02.300]   No, legs might make the issue worse.
[02:06:02.300 --> 02:06:02.860]   Maybe that's good.
[02:06:02.860 --> 02:06:03.420]   Oh, you're right.
[02:06:03.420 --> 02:06:03.420]   Maybe that's good.
[02:06:03.420 --> 02:06:04.060]   Have legs.
[02:06:04.060 --> 02:06:07.820]   Oh, you're absolutely right.
[02:06:07.820 --> 02:06:09.420]   Maybe we should just be floating heads.
[02:06:09.420 --> 02:06:12.060]   That's a possibility.
[02:06:12.060 --> 02:06:15.820]   Peter Thiel is leaving the Facebook board.
[02:06:15.820 --> 02:06:20.300]   That sounded like good news until I heard what he's going to do,
[02:06:20.300 --> 02:06:23.100]   his focus on the 2022 midterms.
[02:06:23.100 --> 02:06:23.820]   Oh, crap.
[02:06:26.060 --> 02:06:27.660]   Well, what she could have done anyway,
[02:06:27.660 --> 02:06:29.500]   like the board stops him from doing that.
[02:06:29.500 --> 02:06:29.820]   Maybe--
[02:06:29.820 --> 02:06:30.540]   Doing that all along.
[02:06:30.540 --> 02:06:31.980]   Maybe if he's two partisan.
[02:06:31.980 --> 02:06:33.020]   Well--
[02:06:33.020 --> 02:06:35.980]   Oh, like he was Mr. Neutral before.
[02:06:35.980 --> 02:06:36.620]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:06:36.620 --> 02:06:39.340]   Yeah, I think somebody--
[02:06:39.340 --> 02:06:41.020]   I don't know.
[02:06:41.020 --> 02:06:44.300]   He's a trumper, and he's got a slate of candidates
[02:06:44.300 --> 02:06:46.540]   who are allies of the former president
[02:06:46.540 --> 02:06:48.380]   that he wants to throw money at,
[02:06:48.380 --> 02:06:49.500]   and he's got a lot of money.
[02:06:49.500 --> 02:06:54.300]   And I imagine no company wants to be on super partisan plot.
[02:06:54.300 --> 02:06:55.260]   No companies can be like--
[02:06:55.260 --> 02:06:56.060]   Yeah, I would think--
[02:06:56.060 --> 02:06:56.780]   I think that.
[02:06:56.780 --> 02:06:58.220]   I would think Facebook might--
[02:06:58.220 --> 02:07:00.140]   Yeah, they put up with it.
[02:07:00.140 --> 02:07:01.420]   Yeah.
[02:07:01.420 --> 02:07:04.220]   I think it was more hidden earlier on.
[02:07:04.220 --> 02:07:04.940]   Right.
[02:07:04.940 --> 02:07:06.860]   And now they're like, yeah, if you're doing this again, no.
[02:07:06.860 --> 02:07:09.020]   No.
[02:07:09.020 --> 02:07:15.020]   All right, I'm done with this scrolling thing.
[02:07:15.020 --> 02:07:15.660]   Done?
[02:07:15.660 --> 02:07:16.460]   You've had it?
[02:07:16.460 --> 02:07:17.020]   I've had it.
[02:07:17.020 --> 02:07:18.540]   You're going to get to your picks of the week,
[02:07:18.540 --> 02:07:22.460]   so please prepare them to whatever you need to do.
[02:07:22.460 --> 02:07:25.260]   Toast to Stroupwaffle, if you have to,
[02:07:25.260 --> 02:07:28.940]   but get ready because it's the pick of the week time coming up.
[02:07:28.940 --> 02:07:30.700]   Our show today brought to you by Melissa,
[02:07:30.700 --> 02:07:35.020]   the address experts 15%.
[02:07:35.020 --> 02:07:36.700]   This is kind of mind-boggling.
[02:07:36.700 --> 02:07:41.340]   15% of the US population moves every year, every year.
[02:07:41.340 --> 02:07:45.420]   And if you have an address list for customers or suppliers
[02:07:45.420 --> 02:07:48.140]   or bills or Christmas cards or whatever,
[02:07:48.140 --> 02:07:52.140]   that's 15% of them that are going missing.
[02:07:53.020 --> 02:07:55.420]   To ensure your business is successful,
[02:07:55.420 --> 02:07:57.580]   your customer information has to be accurate.
[02:07:57.580 --> 02:08:01.660]   Melissa, make sure your data is current and accurate.
[02:08:01.660 --> 02:08:01.980]   Yeah.
[02:08:01.980 --> 02:08:02.620]   How does it do it?
[02:08:02.620 --> 02:08:03.660]   It's amazing.
[02:08:03.660 --> 02:08:06.460]   They've been doing this for over 35 years.
[02:08:06.460 --> 02:08:07.740]   They call it data quality,
[02:08:07.740 --> 02:08:08.700]   their experience,
[02:08:08.700 --> 02:08:09.580]   their independent.
[02:08:09.580 --> 02:08:14.700]   10,000 businesses consider them the authorities on addresses,
[02:08:14.700 --> 02:08:15.740]   not just addresses,
[02:08:15.740 --> 02:08:17.900]   emails, phone numbers, names.
[02:08:17.900 --> 02:08:20.780]   Melissa has a renewal rate of over 92%.
[02:08:21.900 --> 02:08:25.980]   The ROI 25% typically from Melissa customers.
[02:08:25.980 --> 02:08:27.500]   It saves you money,
[02:08:27.500 --> 02:08:29.900]   no more sending to the wrong address,
[02:08:29.900 --> 02:08:32.780]   billing people incorrectly.
[02:08:32.780 --> 02:08:36.140]   Maybe you've got duplicate information in your database.
[02:08:36.140 --> 02:08:38.940]   Melissa's data matching will help eliminate clutters
[02:08:38.940 --> 02:08:42.140]   and duplicates increasing the accuracy of the database,
[02:08:42.140 --> 02:08:45.900]   which means less postage, fewer lower mailing costs,
[02:08:45.900 --> 02:08:50.940]   global address verification for 240 plus countries
[02:08:50.940 --> 02:08:51.980]   and territories.
[02:08:51.980 --> 02:08:54.060]   And you could do it in any form you like.
[02:08:54.060 --> 02:08:55.260]   They have on-prem,
[02:08:55.260 --> 02:08:56.300]   they have web service,
[02:08:56.300 --> 02:08:57.660]   they have a secure FTP site,
[02:08:57.660 --> 02:09:01.100]   you can upload and download a cleaned list from.
[02:09:01.100 --> 02:09:02.860]   Software as a service,
[02:09:02.860 --> 02:09:05.900]   there's a very nice API you will love.
[02:09:05.900 --> 02:09:08.380]   In fact, a lot of companies just build Melissa right into
[02:09:08.380 --> 02:09:10.300]   their customer service software,
[02:09:10.300 --> 02:09:11.660]   or their ordering software.
[02:09:11.660 --> 02:09:13.180]   You probably already experienced Melissa
[02:09:13.180 --> 02:09:15.740]   when you enter an address and it completes it,
[02:09:15.740 --> 02:09:17.100]   or it says, "Is this it?"
[02:09:17.100 --> 02:09:18.940]   You know, "Is this the ZIP+4?"
[02:09:18.940 --> 02:09:19.660]   That's Melissa.
[02:09:20.300 --> 02:09:22.300]   They could do batch address cleaning,
[02:09:22.300 --> 02:09:24.220]   means you send them an entire address list
[02:09:24.220 --> 02:09:26.700]   and they'll process it for accuracy and completeness.
[02:09:26.700 --> 02:09:29.980]   You'll like this for fraud reduction,
[02:09:29.980 --> 02:09:34.300]   identity verification to reduce risk to ensure compliance
[02:09:34.300 --> 02:09:35.980]   and keep customers happy.
[02:09:35.980 --> 02:09:37.740]   They can do geo-coding,
[02:09:37.740 --> 02:09:39.900]   convert addresses into latitude and longitude,
[02:09:39.900 --> 02:09:42.700]   I'm automatically, quickly and accurately.
[02:09:42.700 --> 02:09:44.620]   And for email,
[02:09:44.620 --> 02:09:45.900]   which is more and more important,
[02:09:45.900 --> 02:09:49.340]   isn't they have 95% of bad email addresses
[02:09:49.340 --> 02:09:52.060]   can be removed or fixed in your database.
[02:09:52.060 --> 02:09:53.580]   That's very nice.
[02:09:53.580 --> 02:09:54.300]   You take a look,
[02:09:54.300 --> 02:09:55.260]   if you want to try Melissa,
[02:09:55.260 --> 02:09:56.700]   they have the lookups apps,
[02:09:56.700 --> 02:09:58.860]   both on iOS and Android.
[02:09:58.860 --> 02:10:00.780]   And you can go in there and search an address
[02:10:00.780 --> 02:10:02.700]   and name or more at your fingertips.
[02:10:02.700 --> 02:10:04.540]   Don't worry, your data is always safe.
[02:10:04.540 --> 02:10:06.620]   Your privacy and the privacy your customers
[02:10:06.620 --> 02:10:09.260]   absolutely assured they undergo continuous,
[02:10:09.260 --> 02:10:11.500]   independent security audits
[02:10:11.500 --> 02:10:14.220]   to reinforce their commitment to data security,
[02:10:14.220 --> 02:10:15.260]   to privacy.
[02:10:15.260 --> 02:10:16.540]   And of course, compliance,
[02:10:16.540 --> 02:10:18.540]   a lot of you have compliance requirements.
[02:10:18.540 --> 02:10:19.980]   You should know they're SOC 2,
[02:10:19.980 --> 02:10:23.260]   HIPAA and GDPR compliant.
[02:10:23.260 --> 02:10:24.700]   And man, do they have great support.
[02:10:24.700 --> 02:10:26.140]   Sign up for that service level agreement.
[02:10:26.140 --> 02:10:29.740]   You'll have access to Melissa's Global Support Center,
[02:10:29.740 --> 02:10:34.060]   24/7, world famous support.
[02:10:34.060 --> 02:10:35.820]   Melissa is a leader in their field.
[02:10:35.820 --> 02:10:37.660]   In fact, I want to congratulate them.
[02:10:37.660 --> 02:10:38.300]   They've been named,
[02:10:38.300 --> 02:10:42.620]   once again, to the data quality magic quadrant by Gardener.
[02:10:42.620 --> 02:10:44.220]   That's the second year in a row.
[02:10:44.220 --> 02:10:45.180]   They're also,
[02:10:45.180 --> 02:10:47.420]   according to G2Craps 2022 report,
[02:10:47.420 --> 02:10:49.420]   a leader in both address verification
[02:10:49.420 --> 02:10:50.700]   and data quality software.
[02:10:50.700 --> 02:10:53.580]   Melissa, they are, they are the address.
[02:10:53.580 --> 02:10:58.380]   Experts make sure your customer contact data is up to date.

[02:11:11.340 --> 02:11:14.220]   Melissa, M-E-L-I-S-S-A.
[02:11:15.580 --> 02:11:19.100]   Dot com/twit.
[02:11:19.100 --> 02:11:22.220]   And now, ladies and gentlemen,
[02:11:22.220 --> 02:11:25.420]   it's time for Stacey's Thing of the Week.
[02:11:25.420 --> 02:11:32.380]   My thing isn't a thing this week.
[02:11:32.380 --> 02:11:34.460]   It's an app.
[02:11:34.460 --> 02:11:35.580]   It's a tour.
[02:11:35.580 --> 02:11:38.300]   Two tours, minor,
[02:11:38.300 --> 02:11:41.420]   black history tours of places I've lived in.
[02:11:41.420 --> 02:11:43.100]   I just thought these were,
[02:11:43.100 --> 02:11:45.660]   I've done the Austin one,
[02:11:45.660 --> 02:11:49.500]   but I have not done the one for Seattle yet.
[02:11:49.500 --> 02:11:50.940]   But I was like, "Ooh, this looks fun."
[02:11:50.940 --> 02:11:52.300]   So I saw that in the Seattle Times.
[02:11:52.300 --> 02:11:53.500]   It's called the Green Book,
[02:11:53.500 --> 02:11:54.300]   which I love.
[02:11:54.300 --> 02:11:56.780]   Is it based on the original Green Book?
[02:11:56.780 --> 02:11:57.900]   Yes.
[02:11:57.900 --> 02:12:00.700]   So basically, both of these,
[02:12:00.700 --> 02:12:04.700]   the Seattle one is the one I haven't done,
[02:12:04.700 --> 02:12:05.660]   but it's an app.
[02:12:05.660 --> 02:12:07.900]   So if you go on your phone,
[02:12:07.900 --> 02:12:09.100]   you can download the app
[02:12:09.100 --> 02:12:11.260]   and it's an audio self-guided tour
[02:12:11.260 --> 02:12:12.700]   around parts of Seattle.
[02:12:12.700 --> 02:12:16.620]   It kind of gives a lot of information about
[02:12:16.620 --> 02:12:19.900]   anybody who was black,
[02:12:19.900 --> 02:12:20.860]   live in there before.
[02:12:20.860 --> 02:12:22.380]   And I think it's
[02:12:22.380 --> 02:12:25.900]   important to understand
[02:12:25.900 --> 02:12:30.700]   how much cities have historically paved over
[02:12:30.700 --> 02:12:32.860]   black communities as part of COVID-19.
[02:12:32.860 --> 02:12:35.980]   This was originally,
[02:12:35.980 --> 02:12:38.780]   so this was developed by Black and Tan Hall,
[02:12:38.780 --> 02:12:40.220]   Seattle Organization,
[02:12:40.220 --> 02:12:41.580]   as an in-person guided tour.
[02:12:41.580 --> 02:12:43.020]   But after COVID, they decided,
[02:12:43.020 --> 02:12:46.700]   "You know, we should make this online and audio."
[02:12:46.700 --> 02:12:48.940]   I think that's really cool.
[02:12:48.940 --> 02:12:50.940]   And you can just listen yourself.
[02:12:50.940 --> 02:12:53.420]   That's really cool.
[02:12:53.420 --> 02:12:54.780]   And you get to know your city.
[02:12:54.780 --> 02:12:55.820]   So I did that for Seattle.
[02:12:55.820 --> 02:12:57.340]   And then I had done one,
[02:12:57.340 --> 02:12:59.020]   and this one gets updated all the time.
[02:12:59.020 --> 02:13:01.260]   This is a virtual tour of the UT campus,
[02:13:01.260 --> 02:13:04.140]   which y'all may be aware of,
[02:13:04.140 --> 02:13:06.780]   has some incredibly racist traditions.
[02:13:06.780 --> 02:13:07.340]   Oh, really?
[02:13:07.340 --> 02:13:08.860]   No, I wasn't.
[02:13:08.860 --> 02:13:09.180]   Okay.
[02:13:10.060 --> 02:13:11.020]   Were you really not?
[02:13:11.020 --> 02:13:11.980]   No, I didn't know.
[02:13:11.980 --> 02:13:12.780]   Oh, okay.
[02:13:12.780 --> 02:13:13.580]   I have to admit,
[02:13:13.580 --> 02:13:14.380]   we had to consider a statue
[02:13:14.380 --> 02:13:15.820]   up until we 7G.
[02:13:15.820 --> 02:13:18.780]   When I went to see the Austin State House,
[02:13:18.780 --> 02:13:20.140]   there's a lovely statue
[02:13:20.140 --> 02:13:23.100]   about states' rights right there in the front.
[02:13:23.100 --> 02:13:23.580]   And it's like,
[02:13:23.580 --> 02:13:25.580]   "Yeah, I know what states' rights means."
[02:13:25.580 --> 02:13:26.700]   Okay, fine.
[02:13:26.700 --> 02:13:27.740]   That's probably gone too,
[02:13:27.740 --> 02:13:28.380]   I would imagine.
[02:13:28.380 --> 02:13:31.180]   It was there when I went to South by five years ago,
[02:13:31.180 --> 02:13:31.820]   four years ago.
[02:13:31.820 --> 02:13:32.940]   Yeah, I mean,
[02:13:32.940 --> 02:13:34.700]   even when I was going to school at UT Austin,
[02:13:34.700 --> 02:13:35.980]   it was a tour guide.
[02:13:35.980 --> 02:13:38.380]   There, like, we had a South,
[02:13:38.380 --> 02:13:39.180]   the South Mall,
[02:13:39.180 --> 02:13:40.220]   they had a picture down there.
[02:13:40.220 --> 02:13:41.260]   Jefferson Davis,
[02:13:41.260 --> 02:13:41.660]   geez.
[02:13:41.660 --> 02:13:42.780]   Yeah, that, okay.
[02:13:42.780 --> 02:13:44.780]   And like part of the stated tour
[02:13:44.780 --> 02:13:46.380]   from lots of people was,
[02:13:46.380 --> 02:13:48.620]   so lots of the tour guides was like,
[02:13:48.620 --> 02:13:51.580]   "This fountain here is in honor of the South rising again.
[02:13:51.580 --> 02:13:52.540]   One day it will happen."
[02:13:52.540 --> 02:13:52.940]   And I'm like,
[02:13:52.940 --> 02:13:55.580]   "Oh, no wonder we don't have any people who are black here."
[02:13:55.580 --> 02:13:57.500]   Save your Confederate dollars, boys.
[02:13:57.500 --> 02:14:00.460]   The South rise again.
[02:14:00.460 --> 02:14:02.780]   So she's the southeast.
[02:14:02.780 --> 02:14:03.180]   Oops.
[02:14:03.180 --> 02:14:05.900]   So yeah, so this is the UT tour.
[02:14:05.900 --> 02:14:08.780]   And there's just lots of really interesting information.
[02:14:08.780 --> 02:14:10.140]   I don't know.
[02:14:10.140 --> 02:14:10.780]   I think it's,
[02:14:10.780 --> 02:14:13.580]   I love learning the history of any place
[02:14:13.580 --> 02:14:16.300]   and learning a history that's been actively erased
[02:14:16.300 --> 02:14:17.260]   is always, I think,
[02:14:17.260 --> 02:14:18.060]   fourth or half.
[02:14:18.060 --> 02:14:20.620]   Were you in the women's hall or did you,
[02:14:20.620 --> 02:14:23.980]   by then were they kind of integrated?
[02:14:23.980 --> 02:14:26.620]   Did they allow the ladies part of the rest of the campus?
[02:14:26.620 --> 02:14:28.540]   I stayed off campus.
[02:14:28.540 --> 02:14:29.020]   Okay.
[02:14:29.020 --> 02:14:30.540]   So I went to Yale.
[02:14:30.540 --> 02:14:31.100]   I was in Kansas.
[02:14:31.100 --> 02:14:33.100]   I went to Yale in '73.
[02:14:33.900 --> 02:14:37.340]   They had only recently allowed women at Yale.
[02:14:37.340 --> 02:14:39.580]   And for a long time,
[02:14:39.580 --> 02:14:41.900]   the women weren't one dorm building way at the end,
[02:14:41.900 --> 02:14:44.780]   like as far away as possible from the guys.
[02:14:44.780 --> 02:14:47.820]   And, you know, actually,
[02:14:47.820 --> 02:14:51.420]   the history of black people at Yale,
[02:14:51.420 --> 02:14:52.300]   black men at Yale,
[02:14:52.300 --> 02:14:54.060]   is longer than the history of women at Yale,
[02:14:54.060 --> 02:14:56.140]   which is surprising.
[02:14:56.140 --> 02:14:56.460]   Yeah.
[02:14:56.460 --> 02:14:58.540]   They really didn't like women.
[02:14:58.540 --> 02:15:00.380]   I don't know why.
[02:15:00.380 --> 02:15:01.580]   This is cool.
[02:15:01.580 --> 02:15:02.700]   I like this Austin one.
[02:15:03.260 --> 02:15:03.900]   During Hall,
[02:15:03.900 --> 02:15:05.580]   Painter Hall, steps to the West Mall,
[02:15:05.580 --> 02:15:06.140]   South Mall.
[02:15:06.140 --> 02:15:07.900]   Jefferson Davis.
[02:15:07.900 --> 02:15:09.100]   Anybody who's interested in it?
[02:15:09.100 --> 02:15:14.940]   There's a whole area across the street from the West campus.
[02:15:14.940 --> 02:15:19.260]   It was a black community called Weepill,
[02:15:19.260 --> 02:15:21.740]   which there's the Weepill Co-op a little further down there.
[02:15:21.740 --> 02:15:22.540]   But I was like,
[02:15:22.540 --> 02:15:22.860]   what?
[02:15:22.860 --> 02:15:25.580]   And then the people who live there were really excited
[02:15:25.580 --> 02:15:28.620]   and they advocated for the creation of UT.
[02:15:28.620 --> 02:15:29.580]   And then UT, like,
[02:15:29.580 --> 02:15:32.300]   basically once they were there,
[02:15:32.860 --> 02:15:35.500]   demand for real estate just totally like bulldoze
[02:15:35.500 --> 02:15:37.500]   the entire black section of town
[02:15:37.500 --> 02:15:39.500]   and push them over to the east side,
[02:15:39.500 --> 02:15:42.220]   which now gentrification is doing the same thing.
[02:15:42.220 --> 02:15:42.460]   Yeah, right.
[02:15:42.460 --> 02:15:44.460]   I don't think it sounds like gentrification to me.
[02:15:44.460 --> 02:15:46.140]   Fascinating.
[02:15:46.140 --> 02:15:48.220]   So Seattle and Austin,
[02:15:48.220 --> 02:15:49.740]   were UT anyway.
[02:15:49.740 --> 02:15:53.340]   I would encourage you to look for these sorts of things
[02:15:53.340 --> 02:15:54.380]   in your own cities.
[02:15:54.380 --> 02:15:55.660]   If this is, I mean, I love this.
[02:15:55.660 --> 02:15:56.700]   I was just going to say that.
[02:15:56.700 --> 02:15:57.740]   I was just going to say that.
[02:15:57.740 --> 02:15:59.180]   I think, you know,
[02:15:59.180 --> 02:16:01.580]   when we were in Hawaii, we did these tours.
[02:16:01.580 --> 02:16:03.740]   You put bringing your car and you drive around.
[02:16:03.740 --> 02:16:04.780]   I love this idea.
[02:16:04.780 --> 02:16:05.980]   You've got a phone.
[02:16:05.980 --> 02:16:06.860]   You've got an internet.
[02:16:06.860 --> 02:16:09.100]   You could actually give your own tours
[02:16:09.100 --> 02:16:10.140]   of all sorts of stuff.
[02:16:10.140 --> 02:16:11.740]   This is a great idea.
[02:16:11.740 --> 02:16:13.180]   Great idea.
[02:16:13.180 --> 02:16:17.100]   The Green Book Seattle Green Book Self Guided Tour
[02:16:17.100 --> 02:16:19.580]   from Black and Tan Hall,
[02:16:19.580 --> 02:16:21.340]   which has--
[02:16:21.340 --> 02:16:22.380]   Yeah, they have an exhibit
[02:16:22.380 --> 02:16:23.660]   dedicated to the Green Book,
[02:16:23.660 --> 02:16:25.420]   I think that opens this weekend.
[02:16:25.420 --> 02:16:27.820]   Yeah, look at this merch.
[02:16:27.820 --> 02:16:29.100]   You might like some of this stuff.
[02:16:29.100 --> 02:16:29.900]   This is cool.
[02:16:29.900 --> 02:16:30.700]   This is pretty cool.
[02:16:30.700 --> 02:16:31.420]   Yeah.
[02:16:31.420 --> 02:16:32.220]   Yeah.
[02:16:32.220 --> 02:16:33.740]   Nice stuff.
[02:16:33.740 --> 02:16:36.940]   Thank you, Stacey.
[02:16:36.940 --> 02:16:37.900]   It's Black History Month.
[02:16:37.900 --> 02:16:38.620]   I almost forgot.
[02:16:38.620 --> 02:16:41.580]   So thank you for helping us commemorate it.
[02:16:41.580 --> 02:16:41.980]   Jeff.
[02:16:41.980 --> 02:16:42.540]   Nice picks.
[02:16:42.540 --> 02:16:44.460]   You got the number?
[02:16:44.460 --> 02:16:46.460]   A few media things here.
[02:16:46.460 --> 02:16:46.860]   All right.
[02:16:46.860 --> 02:16:51.180]   So after Hamilton went on to Disney
[02:16:51.180 --> 02:16:53.100]   and Wonder Woman went on to--
[02:16:53.100 --> 02:16:53.820]   Oh, yeah.
[02:16:53.820 --> 02:16:54.860]   --to the HBO.
[02:16:54.860 --> 02:16:55.820]   Yeah.
[02:16:55.820 --> 02:16:57.580]   And Greyhound went on to Apple.
[02:16:57.580 --> 02:17:00.460]   Of course, there was a huge spike
[02:17:00.460 --> 02:17:01.980]   in subscriptions.
[02:17:01.980 --> 02:17:03.820]   Six months later,
[02:17:03.820 --> 02:17:07.900]   one half who had signed up
[02:17:07.900 --> 02:17:10.300]   within three days of the release of each,
[02:17:10.300 --> 02:17:10.780]   were gone.
[02:17:10.780 --> 02:17:12.140]   Wow.
[02:17:12.140 --> 02:17:14.540]   You can look at that as a major failure--
[02:17:14.540 --> 02:17:15.180]   Half stayed.
[02:17:15.180 --> 02:17:15.980]   Or how we saw--
[02:17:15.980 --> 02:17:16.940]   Half stayed.
[02:17:16.940 --> 02:17:17.980]   And it's a new plateau.
[02:17:17.980 --> 02:17:19.340]   Right.
[02:17:19.340 --> 02:17:19.580]   Mm-hmm.
[02:17:19.580 --> 02:17:22.380]   So that's one.
[02:17:22.380 --> 02:17:23.580]   That's very interesting.
[02:17:23.580 --> 02:17:24.940]   The other one is on Axios.
[02:17:24.940 --> 02:17:26.060]   If you have to scroll--
[02:17:26.060 --> 02:17:27.340]   I hate to make you scroll, Leo.
[02:17:27.340 --> 02:17:27.900]   I don't want you to--
[02:17:27.900 --> 02:17:28.460]   [Sighs]
[02:17:28.460 --> 02:17:28.940]   --talked.
[02:17:28.940 --> 02:17:29.580]   It's busted.
[02:17:29.580 --> 02:17:32.780]   Down to number six in the Axios thing,
[02:17:32.780 --> 02:17:33.820]   because there's no Perman Lake,
[02:17:33.820 --> 02:17:35.340]   which is a rather surprising, actually.
[02:17:35.340 --> 02:17:40.060]   They tracked TikTok followers for select media outlets.
[02:17:40.060 --> 02:17:43.020]   So ESPN, not surprisingly, has 22 million
[02:17:43.020 --> 02:17:44.140]   TikTok followers.
[02:17:44.140 --> 02:17:44.780]   Wow.
[02:17:44.780 --> 02:17:46.540]   Washington Post, which has a full-time guy,
[02:17:46.540 --> 02:17:49.100]   just had another one, only has a million.
[02:17:49.100 --> 02:17:50.540]   That's half of my sons.
[02:17:50.540 --> 02:17:51.500]   I don't understand.
[02:17:51.500 --> 02:17:51.980]   I don't understand.
[02:17:51.980 --> 02:17:53.180]   I'm prepared to compress that.
[02:17:53.180 --> 02:17:54.700]   My son has twice as many.
[02:17:54.700 --> 02:17:54.700]   Hey.
[02:17:54.700 --> 02:17:56.220]   Yes.
[02:17:56.220 --> 02:17:57.900]   Most of these outlets.
[02:17:57.900 --> 02:17:59.500]   SaltHank beats them.
[02:17:59.500 --> 02:18:01.900]   He's a twice of TMZ for gun sakes.
[02:18:01.900 --> 02:18:05.340]   He's twice BuzzFeed.
[02:18:05.340 --> 02:18:06.220]   I love that.
[02:18:06.220 --> 02:18:10.700]   He's twice ABC News and USA Today and Sports Illustrated.
[02:18:10.700 --> 02:18:12.220]   SaltHank, folks.
[02:18:12.220 --> 02:18:13.980]   Salt_Hank.
[02:18:13.980 --> 02:18:15.180]   That's awesome.
[02:18:15.180 --> 02:18:19.500]   If you go to the Apple App Store and search for TikTok,
[02:18:19.500 --> 02:18:22.300]   he's featured on the App Store,
[02:18:22.300 --> 02:18:25.580]   because he's doing a thing with Taste Made
[02:18:27.340 --> 02:18:30.540]   that's, I guess, a romantic dinner for two,
[02:18:30.540 --> 02:18:31.420]   which is ironic.
[02:18:31.420 --> 02:18:34.220]   But anyway, since I don't think he has a girlfriend,
[02:18:34.220 --> 02:18:35.180]   maybe he does have a girlfriend.
[02:18:35.180 --> 02:18:35.580]   I don't know.
[02:18:35.580 --> 02:18:37.500]   He doesn't tell me.
[02:18:37.500 --> 02:18:39.100]   Probably not telling him, Dan.
[02:18:39.100 --> 02:18:40.460]   He's not telling Dan.
[02:18:40.460 --> 02:18:41.740]   Let's see if he's still on there.
[02:18:41.740 --> 02:18:43.580]   No, they took it down.
[02:18:43.580 --> 02:18:44.620]   I guess he did it,
[02:18:44.620 --> 02:18:46.780]   but they were promoting a live event he was going to do
[02:18:46.780 --> 02:18:48.620]   with Taste Made on right there on the App Store,
[02:18:48.620 --> 02:18:49.420]   which is kind of cool.
[02:18:49.420 --> 02:18:51.820]   Yeah, that's amazing.
[02:18:51.820 --> 02:18:53.180]   He's a...
[02:18:53.180 --> 02:18:54.940]   So it's here with the heartthrob, is that it?
[02:18:54.940 --> 02:18:55.900]   Hank the heartthrob.
[02:18:56.540 --> 02:18:59.900]   He's almost got as many TikTok followers as CBS News.
[02:18:59.900 --> 02:19:03.340]   That's pretty amazing.
[02:19:03.340 --> 02:19:04.700]   Now the digital ones do a little bit.
[02:19:04.700 --> 02:19:05.980]   Now this is 4 million,
[02:19:05.980 --> 02:19:07.500]   bustle is 3 million.
[02:19:07.500 --> 02:19:10.700]   But honestly, it's what they're putting up there, right?
[02:19:10.700 --> 02:19:11.340]   Yeah.
[02:19:11.340 --> 02:19:11.740]   Yeah.
[02:19:11.740 --> 02:19:16.540]   Yeah, he's got 1.8 million followers
[02:19:16.540 --> 02:19:19.260]   and a ungodly number of likes.
[02:19:19.260 --> 02:19:20.780]   It's like 30 or 40 million.
[02:19:20.780 --> 02:19:23.180]   She's very cool.
[02:19:23.180 --> 02:19:24.540]   But once again, I was just watching.
[02:19:24.540 --> 02:19:25.820]   I was just going to TikTok last night.
[02:19:26.460 --> 02:19:28.380]   And I was going through and going through
[02:19:28.380 --> 02:19:29.740]   and getting my wrist all floppy
[02:19:29.740 --> 02:19:31.260]   and going through and going through.
[02:19:31.260 --> 02:19:32.620]   And then I said,
[02:19:32.620 --> 02:19:34.220]   I haven't seen a salt hank in ages,
[02:19:34.220 --> 02:19:35.500]   and I follow salt hank.
[02:19:35.500 --> 02:19:37.020]   Yeah, me too.
[02:19:37.020 --> 02:19:39.020]   I don't understand the algorithm at all.
[02:19:39.020 --> 02:19:40.780]   I typed in the salt hank.
[02:19:40.780 --> 02:19:41.100]   Yeah.
[02:19:41.100 --> 02:19:44.140]   Yeah, I get the notification of something.
[02:19:44.140 --> 02:19:44.860]   That's what I have to do.
[02:19:44.860 --> 02:19:47.660]   Published days later though.
[02:19:47.660 --> 02:19:51.340]   He was in the radio show in the studio.
[02:19:51.340 --> 02:19:52.860]   I didn't know if you'd run the radio show on Sunday.
[02:19:52.860 --> 02:19:54.060]   That was so funny.
[02:19:54.060 --> 02:19:55.260]   It was so funny.
[02:19:55.260 --> 02:19:57.260]   And we decided to recreate a photo
[02:19:57.260 --> 02:19:59.660]   when he was a baby
[02:19:59.660 --> 02:20:02.860]   and I was working at KSOFO in San Francisco.
[02:20:02.860 --> 02:20:04.460]   He came in the side of my lap.
[02:20:04.460 --> 02:20:06.860]   And that's me with him on my lap.
[02:20:06.860 --> 02:20:08.300]   And then this is obviously,
[02:20:08.300 --> 02:20:09.660]   he's a little bit bigger now.
[02:20:09.660 --> 02:20:10.940]   In fact, I'm looking up to him.
[02:20:10.940 --> 02:20:12.700]   So that was kind of fun.
[02:20:12.700 --> 02:20:14.540]   Yes.
[02:20:14.540 --> 02:20:16.940]   Only salt hank has changed in that picture.
[02:20:16.940 --> 02:20:17.900]   I know.
[02:20:17.900 --> 02:20:20.060]   My hair's a little wider than it was.
[02:20:20.060 --> 02:20:22.060]   He's a sweet guy.
[02:20:22.060 --> 02:20:23.100]   He's a really sweet guy.
[02:20:23.100 --> 02:20:23.500]   Yeah.
[02:20:23.500 --> 02:20:24.860]   And thanks to real Europe groups,
[02:20:24.860 --> 02:20:27.980]   he did the Photoshop because he took the two photos
[02:20:27.980 --> 02:20:29.500]   and put them together on the Twitch set,
[02:20:29.500 --> 02:20:30.300]   which is hysterical.
[02:20:30.300 --> 02:20:30.700]   Love it.
[02:20:30.700 --> 02:20:34.620]   And prove it.
[02:20:34.620 --> 02:20:35.900]   Pick of the week, my friend.
[02:20:35.900 --> 02:20:37.820]   Let's see.
[02:20:37.820 --> 02:20:38.620]   I have two.
[02:20:38.620 --> 02:20:42.140]   First one, I want to say thank you to Joe Esposito.
[02:20:42.140 --> 02:20:44.140]   I'm hoping I'm saying you last night correctly.
[02:20:44.140 --> 02:20:46.060]   I was on his show.
[02:20:46.060 --> 02:20:48.700]   The ozone nightmare recently.
[02:20:48.700 --> 02:20:51.500]   Joe was actually a member of our club.
[02:20:51.500 --> 02:20:52.060]   Oh, nice.
[02:20:52.060 --> 02:20:54.220]   Discord and he watches the show.
[02:20:54.220 --> 02:20:54.700]   This show.
[02:20:54.700 --> 02:20:57.020]   We had a lot of fun.
[02:20:57.020 --> 02:21:01.020]   Jarvis, we even talked about cold type and stuff
[02:21:01.020 --> 02:21:06.060]   and got into talking about thoughts because he's a graphics designer.
[02:21:06.060 --> 02:21:08.460]   I believe that when I look at his website, it's gorgeous.
[02:21:08.460 --> 02:21:12.860]   Look, he does all his links in like type.
[02:21:12.860 --> 02:21:13.820]   That's kind of cool.
[02:21:13.820 --> 02:21:15.180]   It's pretty nice.
[02:21:15.180 --> 02:21:17.500]   But it was a really, really fun conversation.
[02:21:17.500 --> 02:21:20.700]   I appreciate him having the on just to chit chat
[02:21:20.700 --> 02:21:21.900]   and have a beer or two.
[02:21:21.900 --> 02:21:23.900]   Ozone.
[02:21:23.900 --> 02:21:26.220]   The ozone nightmare is the name of the podcast.
[02:21:26.220 --> 02:21:28.300]   The ozone nightmare is the show.
[02:21:28.300 --> 02:21:34.460]   And next, I just wanted to say a big thank you to Miss Robin Roberts.
[02:21:34.460 --> 02:21:35.260]   Y'all know of her.
[02:21:35.260 --> 02:21:35.820]   Oh, yeah.
[02:21:35.820 --> 02:21:36.860]   Good morning, America.
[02:21:36.860 --> 02:21:43.340]   I'm a page subscriber to Masterclass and, you know, I've been on a mission of trying to
[02:21:43.340 --> 02:21:47.340]   get better, be a better version of Ant Peruit,
[02:21:47.340 --> 02:21:49.180]   whether it be personally or professionally.
[02:21:50.220 --> 02:21:53.580]   So I spent a lot of time in Masterclass and I've been watching her class
[02:21:53.580 --> 02:21:59.100]   and actually finished it now, just regarding public speaking and presentation.
[02:21:59.100 --> 02:22:00.780]   Oh, like media training class?
[02:22:00.780 --> 02:22:01.420]   That's cool.
[02:22:01.420 --> 02:22:03.100]   It's brilliant.
[02:22:03.100 --> 02:22:03.740]   It's brilliant.
[02:22:03.740 --> 02:22:06.220]   Now, granted, there's some things I know already,
[02:22:06.220 --> 02:22:11.500]   but it was nice just to get her perspective and her being a woman of color,
[02:22:11.500 --> 02:22:16.460]   being a woman in the industry and the things that she's seeing that I hadn't seen
[02:22:16.460 --> 02:22:22.540]   and bringing it to light and just helping people that are curious about getting in the broadcast
[02:22:22.540 --> 02:22:24.220]   and the content creation and so forth.
[02:22:24.220 --> 02:22:26.380]   It's, I love it.
[02:22:26.380 --> 02:22:31.660]   Not trying to sound like an ad, but yeah, Masterclass used to sponsor us at some point in time,
[02:22:31.660 --> 02:22:32.540]   but man, I love it.
[02:22:32.540 --> 02:22:36.620]   I bought the subscription right away and I use it all the time.
[02:22:36.620 --> 02:22:39.900]   And that class right there is worth it in gold right there.
[02:22:39.900 --> 02:22:41.340]   I'm going to have to go check it out.
[02:22:41.340 --> 02:22:42.220]   I still have my account.
[02:22:42.220 --> 02:22:42.860]   That's great.
[02:22:42.860 --> 02:22:44.700]   That's really great.
[02:22:44.700 --> 02:22:46.940]   Your Masterclass is amazing at the people that get in there.
[02:22:46.940 --> 02:22:47.420]   Wow.
[02:22:47.420 --> 02:22:48.460]   It's kind of unbelievable.
[02:22:48.460 --> 02:22:48.700]   It's kind of wonderful.
[02:22:48.700 --> 02:22:49.100]   It's been there.
[02:22:49.100 --> 02:22:50.940]   Samuel Jackson's Masterclass on--
[02:22:50.940 --> 02:22:51.900]   Oh, is that good?
[02:22:51.900 --> 02:22:52.460]   Acting.
[02:22:52.460 --> 02:22:53.820]   Oh my God, is that good?
[02:22:53.820 --> 02:22:57.420]   Man, there's one part in there.
[02:22:57.420 --> 02:23:01.900]   I won't give too much of it away where he talks about having to dress like a bum
[02:23:01.900 --> 02:23:04.860]   in some film that he was in.
[02:23:04.860 --> 02:23:12.140]   He had to dress like a bum and he was inspired by that based off of a personal situation where
[02:23:12.140 --> 02:23:19.020]   he was on the subway in New York and got home, was heading home, fell asleep in the subway,
[02:23:19.020 --> 02:23:24.300]   and woke up with somebody laying on him that had bugs and stuff crawling all over him.
[02:23:24.300 --> 02:23:28.060]   It's sickening him a little bit.
[02:23:28.060 --> 02:23:31.420]   So he says he ran home and he got in the shower and just like, "Oh God."
[02:23:31.420 --> 02:23:35.740]   And then he's like, "That's what I need people to feel when I am this bum on this
[02:23:36.940 --> 02:23:43.580]   TV show or a movie or whatever it was." And so it inspired him to be able to present that
[02:23:43.580 --> 02:23:45.180]   back to the people watching that film.
[02:23:45.180 --> 02:23:47.820]   He's an amazing guy.
[02:23:47.820 --> 02:23:49.340]   Really amazing.
[02:23:49.340 --> 02:23:50.220]   And a great actor.
[02:23:50.220 --> 02:23:53.020]   Thank you, Ant.
[02:23:53.020 --> 02:23:57.260]   Man, if you start acting like those two, I'm in trouble.
[02:23:57.260 --> 02:24:02.220]   The Ant, Robin Roberts, Bashup.
[02:24:02.220 --> 02:24:07.420]   I can see the Ant, Samuel L. Jackson mashup. It's a little harder to picture, but sure.
[02:24:07.420 --> 02:24:09.340]   He's too sweet. He's too sweet, isn't he?
[02:24:09.340 --> 02:24:10.940]   Nice.
[02:24:10.940 --> 02:24:13.100]   I'm just trying to get better at this stuff.
[02:24:13.100 --> 02:24:14.060]   Just say this.
[02:24:14.060 --> 02:24:14.620]   That's all it is.
[02:24:14.620 --> 02:24:18.140]   No, motherf and snakes on this motherf.
[02:24:18.140 --> 02:24:19.980]   Plain, just say that.
[02:24:19.980 --> 02:24:23.740]   That's awesome.
[02:24:23.740 --> 02:24:24.300]   That's awesome.
[02:24:24.300 --> 02:24:25.020]   I was serious.
[02:24:25.020 --> 02:24:26.540]   I just want to get better at this.
[02:24:26.540 --> 02:24:28.300]   I look at you and I look at Mr.
[02:24:28.300 --> 02:24:29.820]   Mr. Howl.
[02:24:29.820 --> 02:24:33.580]   Now, looking at Mr. Sergeant and I'm like, "Yeah, these cats, they got it.
[02:24:33.580 --> 02:24:35.180]   They're so good."
[02:24:35.180 --> 02:24:36.460]   Oh, you just want to sharpen on?
[02:24:36.460 --> 02:24:36.860]   I just want to sharpen on.
[02:24:36.860 --> 02:24:38.220]   Don't be silly.
[02:24:38.220 --> 02:24:39.100]   You're fantastic.
[02:24:39.100 --> 02:24:40.620]   People are sending you liquor.
[02:24:40.620 --> 02:24:41.420]   You're doing things.
[02:24:41.420 --> 02:24:45.740]   You're just, you are an authentic being.
[02:24:45.740 --> 02:24:46.220]   Absolutely.
[02:24:46.220 --> 02:24:47.260]   And that is what we love.
[02:24:47.260 --> 02:24:47.820]   Yeah.
[02:24:47.820 --> 02:24:49.260]   No, you got it.
[02:24:49.260 --> 02:24:50.220]   Absolutely have it.
[02:24:50.220 --> 02:24:52.940]   But hey, you know, that's great.
[02:24:52.940 --> 02:24:55.020]   Everybody should work hard to become better.
[02:24:55.020 --> 02:24:55.500]   Except me.
[02:24:55.500 --> 02:24:58.780]   I'm working hard to retire.
[02:24:58.780 --> 02:25:00.220]   But that's another story for another day.
[02:25:00.220 --> 02:25:01.340]   That's where I'm trying to get to.
[02:25:01.340 --> 02:25:09.180]   @pro@handsonphotography, twit.tv/hop.
[02:25:09.180 --> 02:25:13.340]   He's also the community manager at our club twit.
[02:25:13.340 --> 02:25:15.420]   Give us a plug for Club Twit.
[02:25:15.420 --> 02:25:19.900]   Well, for Club Twit, that is our members platform.
[02:25:19.900 --> 02:25:22.140]   It allows you to catch all of our shows,
[02:25:22.140 --> 02:25:23.660]   add free here on the network.
[02:25:23.660 --> 02:25:26.300]   But that's not even the main perk.
[02:25:26.300 --> 02:25:28.380]   Quite honestly, the main perk is the discord.
[02:25:28.380 --> 02:25:28.940]   I agree.
[02:25:28.940 --> 02:25:29.740]   The bonus content.
[02:25:29.740 --> 02:25:30.540]   So cool.
[02:25:30.540 --> 02:25:30.860]   Yeah.
[02:25:30.860 --> 02:25:33.500]   There's a lot of people joined up and they have
[02:25:33.500 --> 02:25:36.780]   random conversations about different topics
[02:25:36.780 --> 02:25:38.620]   inside of our discord server.
[02:25:38.620 --> 02:25:42.380]   And then there's the monthly-ish bonus content
[02:25:42.380 --> 02:25:44.300]   that we'll throw out there in addition to the stuff
[02:25:44.300 --> 02:25:48.220]   that we don't show on the cutting room floor.
[02:25:48.220 --> 02:25:50.780]   Got the book club with Miss Stacy Higginbotham
[02:25:50.780 --> 02:25:54.220]   where we talk about some books that I have no idea about.
[02:25:54.220 --> 02:25:55.580]   But it's still a lot of fun.
[02:25:56.700 --> 02:25:59.500]   And then I have some fireside chats and AMAs.
[02:25:59.500 --> 02:26:02.460]   And, you know, like this Friday, February 11th,
[02:26:02.460 --> 02:26:04.780]   4 p.m. Pacific, Mr. Mike Elgin,
[02:26:04.780 --> 02:26:07.260]   and his better half will be in the studio
[02:26:07.260 --> 02:26:09.020]   to sit down with Chief Twit
[02:26:09.020 --> 02:26:11.340]   to talk about the gastro Nomad experience.
[02:26:11.340 --> 02:26:14.060]   So sign up for a seriously,
[02:26:14.060 --> 02:26:15.820]   it's an expensive cup of coffee of a month
[02:26:15.820 --> 02:26:17.020]   that you have to sacrifice.
[02:26:17.020 --> 02:26:19.420]   Seven dollars a month and you can get into the club.
[02:26:19.420 --> 02:26:21.020]   It's well worth it.
[02:26:21.020 --> 02:26:23.020]   A bottle of hot sauce.
[02:26:23.020 --> 02:26:23.580]   That's it.
[02:26:23.580 --> 02:26:26.140]   That might be the cost of a unicorn frappuccino today.
[02:26:26.140 --> 02:26:27.180]   Probably is.
[02:26:27.180 --> 02:26:28.700]   I'm the think of it.
[02:26:28.700 --> 02:26:30.460]   Thank you, Ann.
[02:26:30.460 --> 02:26:32.700]   Yeah, twit.tv/clubtwit.
[02:26:32.700 --> 02:26:35.900]   And Friday, Mike and I will be here with,
[02:26:35.900 --> 02:26:37.260]   I think Amir is coming too.
[02:26:37.260 --> 02:26:38.860]   And that's a lot of fun.
[02:26:38.860 --> 02:26:39.180]   Yeah.
[02:26:39.180 --> 02:26:44.780]   Jeff Jarvis, thank you so much, Leonard Tap Professor,
[02:26:44.780 --> 02:26:47.420]   Director of the Townite Center,
[02:26:47.420 --> 02:26:49.180]   Entrepreneur.
[02:26:49.180 --> 02:26:53.340]   You know who, Craig?
[02:26:53.340 --> 02:26:55.260]   Ooh, he's eager to get out of here.
[02:26:55.260 --> 02:26:57.740]   Graduate School of Journalism at the University of New York.
[02:26:57.740 --> 02:27:00.300]   That's a little fascinating.
[02:27:00.300 --> 02:27:05.100]   He did not die during the show, so we're good.
[02:27:05.100 --> 02:27:05.820]   That's a good thing.
[02:27:05.820 --> 02:27:07.100]   We'll take that as a win.
[02:27:07.100 --> 02:27:07.740]   Yep, yep.
[02:27:07.740 --> 02:27:10.060]   That's a win.
[02:27:10.060 --> 02:27:11.180]   That's a win.
[02:27:11.180 --> 02:27:13.580]   I know how you feel, Jeff, I do.
[02:27:13.580 --> 02:27:15.900]   And of course, Stacy Higginbotham.
[02:27:15.900 --> 02:27:18.780]   Stacy on IOT.com is her website.
[02:27:18.780 --> 02:27:20.460]   That's where you'll find the IOT podcast.
[02:27:20.460 --> 02:27:21.580]   She does with Kevin Tofel.
[02:27:21.580 --> 02:27:24.780]   The man who's too good for this show.
[02:27:24.780 --> 02:27:27.740]   And we try it.
[02:27:27.740 --> 02:27:29.820]   He spends his winstays.
[02:27:29.820 --> 02:27:30.780]   He's hanging out with this.
[02:27:30.780 --> 02:27:32.700]   I know, he's Python programming.
[02:27:32.700 --> 02:27:33.340]   I know.
[02:27:33.340 --> 02:27:35.100]   He's coding and hanging out with this kid.
[02:27:35.100 --> 02:27:35.980]   You can't resent him for that.
[02:27:35.980 --> 02:27:36.780]   No, I don't.
[02:27:36.780 --> 02:27:37.740]   I'm just teasing.
[02:27:37.740 --> 02:27:38.540]   Actually, I love him.
[02:27:38.540 --> 02:27:40.700]   I just said, we always want him on because we love him so much.
[02:27:40.700 --> 02:27:43.500]   But you got him, and that's what matters.
[02:27:43.500 --> 02:27:45.260]   You also have some news letter there.
[02:27:45.260 --> 02:27:47.340]   I get Kevin in this situation.
[02:27:47.340 --> 02:27:47.660]   Yeah.
[02:27:47.660 --> 02:27:51.820]   So you know how the old Groucho Marx show used to have?
[02:27:51.820 --> 02:27:52.780]   You said the magic word.
[02:27:52.780 --> 02:27:53.820]   The magic word?
[02:27:53.820 --> 02:27:55.420]   Yeah, you duck came down.
[02:27:55.420 --> 02:27:55.900]   Yeah.
[02:27:55.900 --> 02:27:56.300]   Right.
[02:27:56.300 --> 02:27:59.340]   So I always feel like, I want to say something that turns into the show title.
[02:27:59.340 --> 02:28:01.420]   I always wish I could come up with that line.
[02:28:01.420 --> 02:28:02.300]   I'm happy when I do it.
[02:28:02.300 --> 02:28:03.580]   It happens rarely.
[02:28:03.580 --> 02:28:06.300]   But Stacy, I think, did it perfectly tonight.
[02:28:06.300 --> 02:28:07.260]   What is the show title?
[02:28:07.260 --> 02:28:07.980]   Do I have this one or not?
[02:28:07.980 --> 02:28:08.540]   For tonight.
[02:28:08.540 --> 02:28:10.140]   Show title proposed.
[02:28:10.140 --> 02:28:10.700]   Proposed.
[02:28:10.700 --> 02:28:11.020]   Yes.
[02:28:11.020 --> 02:28:13.820]   Stacy's theoreticals on top of hypotheticals.
[02:28:13.820 --> 02:28:16.140]   That's pretty good.
[02:28:16.140 --> 02:28:18.220]   It kind of says it all for the show.
[02:28:18.220 --> 02:28:18.780]   I like it.
[02:28:18.780 --> 02:28:20.220]   From the blue-haired lady.
[02:28:20.220 --> 02:28:21.500]   Come these pearls of wisdom.
[02:28:21.500 --> 02:28:22.860]   Other pearls of wisdom.
[02:28:22.860 --> 02:28:24.060]   Also nominated.
[02:28:24.060 --> 02:28:25.820]   I'm going to go toast a waffle.
[02:28:25.820 --> 02:28:27.820]   There's always so.
[02:28:27.820 --> 02:28:29.100]   People like the waffles.
[02:28:29.100 --> 02:28:29.980]   I mean, I like the waffles.
[02:28:29.980 --> 02:28:31.020]   I'm down with those people.
[02:28:31.020 --> 02:28:32.060]   What do you do?
[02:28:32.060 --> 02:28:34.540]   Invisible Mazda, Call of Husky.
[02:28:34.540 --> 02:28:37.420]   Let's see.
[02:28:37.420 --> 02:28:40.140]   Coronal Mass ejection, the Groucho police.
[02:28:40.140 --> 02:28:43.340]   No JavaScript for you.
[02:28:43.340 --> 02:28:44.300]   But I think you're right.
[02:28:44.300 --> 02:28:45.980]   I do like that.
[02:28:45.980 --> 02:28:47.820]   I think it's a good time.
[02:28:47.820 --> 02:28:48.140]   I didn't mean to.
[02:28:48.140 --> 02:28:48.540]   I didn't mean to.
[02:28:48.540 --> 02:28:49.020]   Theoreticals.
[02:28:49.020 --> 02:28:49.820]   I just wanted to give a question.
[02:28:49.820 --> 02:28:50.700]   Is it too long, John?
[02:28:50.700 --> 02:28:52.380]   Theoreticals on top of hypotheticals?
[02:28:53.100 --> 02:28:53.740]   Oh, it's Burke.
[02:28:53.740 --> 02:28:55.340]   Where's John?
[02:28:55.340 --> 02:28:57.900]   Man, he's the only guy who knows how long he can be.
[02:28:57.900 --> 02:28:58.940]   Oh, man.
[02:28:58.940 --> 02:29:00.540]   Oh, man.
[02:29:00.540 --> 02:29:02.940]   Screw people's Mazda's up with the too long show title.
[02:29:02.940 --> 02:29:03.900]   Oh, he'll be listening to it.
[02:29:03.900 --> 02:29:05.660]   Let's put the percentage signs in the show title.
[02:29:05.660 --> 02:29:06.780]   Oh, gosh.
[02:29:06.780 --> 02:29:07.020]   No.
[02:29:07.020 --> 02:29:10.940]   That's mean.
[02:29:10.940 --> 02:29:11.500]   That would be.
[02:29:11.500 --> 02:29:12.620]   Goss-Moss-de-buyers.
[02:29:12.620 --> 02:29:13.180]   Come on.
[02:29:13.180 --> 02:29:14.380]   That's very mean.
[02:29:14.380 --> 02:29:16.140]   What years is your Mazda, Jeff?
[02:29:16.140 --> 02:29:18.540]   2017, I think, actually.
[02:29:18.540 --> 02:29:19.260]   I don't know.
[02:29:19.260 --> 02:29:20.540]   I think it's right in there.
[02:29:20.540 --> 02:29:20.940]   It is.
[02:29:20.940 --> 02:29:21.740]   It's not less.
[02:29:21.740 --> 02:29:22.300]   Yeah, it is.
[02:29:22.300 --> 02:29:22.780]   It is.
[02:29:22.780 --> 02:29:23.100]   Yeah.
[02:29:23.100 --> 02:29:23.500]   You don't care about it.
[02:29:23.500 --> 02:29:24.780]   Come on out to Seattle.
[02:29:24.780 --> 02:29:25.580]   Land of Bridges.
[02:29:25.580 --> 02:29:28.940]   Yeah, you know how much I love that.
[02:29:28.940 --> 02:29:29.740]   I know.
[02:29:29.740 --> 02:29:31.980]   I'm like Carl-freeze right there.
[02:29:31.980 --> 02:29:33.980]   So I think, actually, the title is going to be
[02:29:33.980 --> 02:29:36.380]   percent invisible Mazda percent.
[02:29:36.380 --> 02:29:37.900]   Just, you know, just in honor of this.
[02:29:37.900 --> 02:29:38.460]   Yeah.
[02:29:38.460 --> 02:29:38.460]   Yeah.
[02:29:38.460 --> 02:29:40.220]   Do it.
[02:29:40.220 --> 02:29:42.620]   Thanks, everybody, for joining us.
[02:29:42.620 --> 02:29:44.700]   We do this week at Google on a Wednesday,

[02:29:52.940 --> 02:29:55.580]   IRC.twit.tv is where the chat room lives.
[02:29:55.580 --> 02:29:57.420]   You don't need an IRC client, by the way.
[02:29:57.420 --> 02:30:01.100]   A web browser will work fine.
[02:30:01.100 --> 02:30:03.900]   We also can chat in the Discord,
[02:30:03.900 --> 02:30:05.100]   if you're a member of ClubTwit.
[02:30:05.100 --> 02:30:09.100]   After the fact, all the shows go to the website, twit.tv.
[02:30:09.100 --> 02:30:15.020]   If you want to download shows for Twig,
[02:30:15.020 --> 02:30:16.700]   it's a twit.tv/twig.

[02:30:35.180 --> 02:30:36.940]   Leave us a five-star review, if you would.
[02:30:36.940 --> 02:30:37.900]   That'd be nice too.
[02:30:37.900 --> 02:30:40.460]   Thanks for joining us, and we'll see you next time
[02:30:40.460 --> 02:30:41.660]   on this week in Google.
