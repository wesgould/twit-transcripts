[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:07.280]   CUNY where it teaches journalism he also blogs a budget machine.com and as the author of geeks bearing gifts and
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.600]   A lot more there it is holding up at the book
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.880]   imagining new futures for news
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:22.160]   Danny Sullivan is also here from search engine land and search engine marketing engine land and all the different lands
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:28.040]   He's from even measles land measles. No, you don't have measles. Do you know?
[00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.160]   But I gotta go to Disneyland on Friday. Oh, yeah, we were thinking this would be a good time of the year to go
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.300]   I'm actually going tomorrow. Yeah, it'll be it won't be anybody there. I
[00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.880]   Know they're all down with measles. How could there be a measles epidemic?
[00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.120]   Because people don't get vaccines currently in this in Southern, California in
[00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:53.560]   Spades or something this bizarre. It's there's definite apparent hot spots where people don't do it. Yeah
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.360]   Well
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:03.400]   They're all getting measles now. I had measles as a kid. I'm old enough. Yeah, and Jeff is - we were we were children before there were
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.480]   vaccines for many of these childhood illnesses
[00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:12.280]   Mm-hmm. I remember growing up getting them and what what a miracle it was that we had these vaccines
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.040]   Yeah, these diseases and now one wants them some mumps
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.560]   Yeah, chicken pox got it. We had them all in fact sometimes
[00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:25.680]   I remember parents if said kid had chicken pox would bring their kids over yeah to get it done before there was a
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.680]   Vaccine you thought well, let's just get it out of the way
[00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:35.880]   Really? No, it's hard to be to be fair Jason. They would put them in the back of the car with no no car seat
[00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:42.280]   And with a cigarette coming out of their mouth and a fear in the other hand is a different time
[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:48.840]   You know Don Draper was having the chicken pox party. What would you do? That's right? Was that a madman? Did that there you go?
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.720]   Chicken pox let's all get it
[00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:57.080]   Well, you want to do it kind of you want to do it kind of when it's convenient as opposed to
[00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.480]   During the school year as well
[00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.040]   Anyway
[00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.120]   So Leo here's my question for you. Yes
[00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.920]   When do you get enough hair to comb? Oh?
[00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:13.360]   Sooner than I not soon enough but at least I have hair there's some shading
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:17.840]   On the dome so it doesn't look quite so I don't look like a skinhead anymore
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.280]   I just look like maybe I got a little over aggressive. Maybe it's trying to be Bruce Willis or something
[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.240]   And you're still not quite back near as Eve
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:27.720]   No, I'm not
[00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.560]   You're not I still have sciatica in my right leg from the doctor said did you
[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.480]   Went to the doctor said doc my legs numb
[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:42.280]   He said sounds like sciatica. Did you do anything when you know remember when it started? I said yeah, no January 1st
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.280]   He said did you do anything unusual?
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:50.800]   That day and I said not too much. Let's see I rode a mechanical bull
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.000]   I learned how to do saber lightsaber fighting. I
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:01.960]   Worked with a stuntman to learn throwing I we had a pop and lock dance group to teach me some dance moves
[00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:08.360]   I stood for 24 hours straight. No, that's a few things and I shared my head and got a tattoo
[00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:10.360]   He said well, it could be sad
[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.600]   Were you really drunk he says no?
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:20.360]   No, I recommend to go straight for you Leo. No, you just said you'll get better eventually and they threw me out of his office
[00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:27.800]   Anyway, good to see you back from Davos. It's odd to come back from Switzerland and have more snow in New York City
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:35.400]   I know I know and I'm jetlight now. Did you have fun at Davos? Yeah? I did in dld before that in Munich
[00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.160]   Yeah, it's it's a good week. It's an exhausting week. I have my roommate again this year was Bill gross
[00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:45.640]   I like bill a lot which is which is cool bills bills the greatest. He is just as nice as guy on earth. Yeah, I love him and
[00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:53.320]   a lot of interesting sessions a lot of talk about publishers and Google and all that any difference from previous
[00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:56.520]   So this is the world economic forum
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:02.680]   And what is it exactly? It's a bunch of as you call a mockers who got together
[00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:08.840]   Yeah, it's 2,500 mockers and I sneak my way in I give them advice about blogging nine years ago
[00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:14.120]   And they forgot to disinvite you're like the court gesture gesture. Yeah. Yeah, we call it faculty Leo
[00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:16.760]   Faculty
[00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:19.160]   Under to amuse and run sessions and things
[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:25.800]   But you know, you just talk with your not go. How could you not have you're once invited? I think you should go with scoble there this year
[00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:31.240]   No, no, it was weird. It was less less of the big there used to be the club hotel the crew
[00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:32.440]   hotel
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:34.440]   used to be filled with scobles and
[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:42.120]   And other folks and they're not there as much more bankers, but that's so maybe they've gotten over their fascination with new media and now they're back to
[00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:44.920]   Well, but then again, you know, the forum is pretty amazing
[00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:52.200]   It does everything in new media and everything about it started publishing on medium before medium asked them to it has stuff all over there
[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:53.800]   pretty good at that
[00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:57.720]   any anything new any new trends there among the
[00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:04.040]   Everybody asked you every year. You know, what's the mood of Davos? I goodness. I didn't hear anybody ask that this year
[00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:08.120]   I practically just did so sorry. What's the mood?
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:12.200]   Truck I don't know
[00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:14.120]   Uh
[00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:15.080]   Yeah
[00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:20.840]   So it's not like they're all hot and bothered about something like hollow lenses or something. They're not going crazy all over that
[00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:27.320]   Well, no, but nadala did talk about that and tried I tried to understand what the heck of hollow lens would look like in the world
[00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:29.960]   But I don't I don't sure I cared. Yeah
[00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:33.880]   Um, okay. There you go. There's your report from
[00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:42.040]   Really boring report from it was I think you sandbagging. I think adavos is probably like the best party ever. You just don't want us to know
[00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:50.520]   Um, uh, mark, but he throws a great party. Mm-hmm. No on friday night google hasn't had a nice party with um, no, I can't
[00:07:51.400 --> 00:08:01.880]   That was a banyos party. The killer is performed. Oh wow. Oh, um, I can't remember who was the google party because i'll don't forget and it was cold
[00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:06.280]   And um a lot of talk about freedom of speech
[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:08.920]   After charlie and doe
[00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:13.720]   a lot of talk about uh, you know google panic at dld I met the new
[00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:23.080]   G the new head of digital for for the eu and he's talking about reopening copyright all across europe that's going to be a lot of fun
[00:08:23.080 --> 00:08:27.320]   A lot of talk about level playing fields and trying to
[00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:31.480]   Disadvantage american companies that are now taking advantage of easier regulation
[00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:36.200]   Well, and I say why not bring the regulation down for everybody rather than rising up for everybody
[00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:39.240]   Um
[00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:40.840]   Do you think i'm stuff?
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:46.360]   Does I never ask you this but you travel more than almost anybody. I know does your you use an xs six now or uh,
[00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:49.480]   And does it work well wherever you go?
[00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:55.560]   Yeah, except this time I tried in an emergency the hotel wifi just just was as good as non-existent
[00:08:55.560 --> 00:09:03.080]   I tried in an emergency to uh, and I have the of the t-mobile free band t a limited. Oh, 18t. Okay
[00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:05.960]   18t and I couldn't
[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:06.840]   um
[00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:08.840]   do the tethering
[00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:14.200]   I couldn't make a hot spot. Uh, and you wouldn't want to the cost of that would be prohibitive
[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:19.080]   Just for it just for an emergency moment. I wanted to and I couldn't do it. It wouldn't let me do it which would you set me?
[00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:23.960]   Yeah, uh, but you know, we're gonna we're gonna have a story about unlimited and then run down later. Maybe she'll talk
[00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:27.800]   I'm actually uh briefly maybe not so briefly gone back to the
[00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:34.360]   One plus one they had his deal last on january 20th. I think that uh for two hours
[00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:36.760]   You didn't need an invite. I said, oh, what the heck?
[00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:41.640]   And you bought another one and I ended up buying another one because i've given my old one to father robert
[00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:44.920]   Jason still has his I you know and coming back to it
[00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:50.680]   It this is a great phone and I love cyanogen. Mom. We'll actually be talking a little bit about cm 11 and maybe cm 12
[00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:54.840]   I find that the the next six is better engineered on things like
[00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:57.720]   odd things like bluetooth connections
[00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:02.600]   Just one plus one was was flaky for me. Maybe yeah, I mean, it's not official actually
[00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:06.120]   Might as well talk about it now according to green bot cyanogen
[00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:11.000]   wants to take and right away from google we do a better job
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.880]   let us uh, let us maintain
[00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:17.880]   Android kirk mcmast kirk mcmaster
[00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:25.320]   wants to build a cyanogen which you know, so the the story the history of cyanogen is kind of interesting it was originally a
[00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:32.200]   Custom rom that people would you know root their android phones and put cyanogen on there and it was
[00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:34.440]   you know, basically
[00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:36.920]   An aosp version of android that you would then
[00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:44.600]   I don't know quasi legally download the all the google apps and make it a google phone. Sorry google. I wasn't talking
[00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:46.840]   Oh, do you need something? I'm here
[00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:52.680]   Don't get it wrong. We're all right
[00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:59.080]   Look up something about cyanogen. I can do that. You know i'm right here. Oh, well, let's go for one
[00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:03.560]   McMaster and so it's and I think you're putting it on one plus one gave it some real
[00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:07.720]   Uh credibility because now it is the official
[00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:10.200]   operating system on at least one
[00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:16.600]   High-end android phone and frankly those of us who used it jina was oh it was always very complimentary. I know you were too
[00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:23.160]   Really liked it. Um, so kirk mcmaster is saying he helps to build cm into a full-fledged android rival
[00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:25.960]   He wants its own app store a more open structure
[00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:28.760]   Uh, it's no sense to me
[00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:30.760]   Uh
[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:37.240]   You're gonna fight against another app store developers have to build for another app store
[00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:43.720]   Uh, well, that's true, but I but I do agree with him when he says that android is really becoming
[00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:46.360]   a commercial product favoring google
[00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:49.000]   services
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:49.880]   and uh
[00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:56.440]   While there is aosp nobody want aosp is the is the open source android minus google stuff
[00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:59.160]   uh, and no no
[00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:04.600]   Sane phone manufacturers gonna do that amazon is the best example of somebody who took aosp and
[00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:07.160]   Forked it and did without use
[00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:17.160]   You know the whole reason I use android because it is integrated with with google plus and google mail with with um gmail and and google maps and
[00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:20.520]   And so on that's exactly the selling point. Yeah
[00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:23.560]   For you, but if you were
[00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:28.600]   You know if you were in a developing country where you just wanted a cheap phone that worked
[00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:35.080]   Pretty much is the way the iphone does it didn't come with that price tag then you might not care that it has to work with google
[00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:44.920]   Now this cm 11 on one plus one has all the google services on it. Yeah, but you're not saving money if it doesn't work with jimmyle
[00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:52.760]   Well, yeah, you're gonna you're gonna save money if you're able to produce an inexpensive device that is not apple's device
[00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:56.120]   And yet it still can run popular app does it cost anything for
[00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:58.840]   Samsung and others to
[00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:05.240]   Make it a google services compatible version of android. They don't pay google money. I don't think they
[00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:11.000]   Pay no, do it. Do you have to go but you have to go through and be like you have to get certified
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:13.720]   Yeah, but that's that's what and I can't remember
[00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:18.680]   I'm not gonna pronounce the name of the chinese company is it chami chami. Thank you
[00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:23.560]   But you know their strategy I don't think is that they're running android google android
[00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:26.760]   They're just seem to be running their own vanilla version of android
[00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:30.520]   But it means that they can produce a device that costs less
[00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:35.640]   But is like an iphone in a market where iphones are popular but expensive
[00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:39.880]   Hence the guy who you know comes through the airport with 800 of them strapped to his body, right?
[00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:42.040]   Well, if i'm chami, I also
[00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:45.320]   Want to make a version a phone that is more chinese centric
[00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:50.120]   Yeah, and so you know and if you're in here and try this like I can't get google search
[00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:53.000]   Well, that's fine. I couldn't get google search even if it wasn't right then
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.960]   So I I think that
[00:13:55.960 --> 00:14:00.440]   You know, I think there there is opportunity for those alternative systems
[00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:03.640]   And I think we're already seeing some of these countries have those alternative systems
[00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:09.000]   But you know in the us I think it would be a huge challenge to try to say go we're going to come out with android
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.800]   And it'll be just like google android except you know none of this stuff you want
[00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:19.720]   Right they've they're they're talking about deeper integrations in ways that google doesn't give you access and that to me
[00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:23.640]   Just screams forking in the same way that like you're talking to any working
[00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:27.480]   Shao me. I mean really what we're seeing right now. It's very interesting
[00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:29.960]   It's suddenly in the past year especially
[00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:35.960]   All eyes are on developing countries and all of the money and all of the users that are there that aren't
[00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:41.080]   Using smartphones yet. So I think what we're seeing here is is cyanogen going from this
[00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:44.920]   Hey look what we can do with android and turning into a company that is
[00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:52.360]   Specifically targeting themselves towards those developing countries because there's a lot of money potentially in the long run to make there in the next five years
[00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:55.560]   Yeah, santa care so much about that but I care more about the the political
[00:14:55.560 --> 00:15:00.440]   Se and mcmaster says he says android today and ios are essentially shells
[00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:04.360]   For google and apple services everybody else exists
[00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:10.360]   In these sandboxes with no let our access to the lower levels of the operating system kernel
[00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:13.960]   So he says you know this we could make it more open
[00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:20.280]   But the cost is you don't you don't get google services and for jeff. That's a non-starter
[00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:28.280]   And the cost of the ecosystem is that you get is it developers that you get you have another store developers have to develop for another thing
[00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:32.440]   I think it's a high high risk for him. Now we can create phones
[00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:38.280]   Where you know you're going to quality software? You're going to have plenty of apps. You're going to have a you know quality
[00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:41.160]   environment, uh, I think it's hubris
[00:15:41.160 --> 00:15:46.520]   I don't think it's hubris. I think it's a political statement, but I think it is
[00:15:46.520 --> 00:15:51.880]   Like many political statements one that is fraught with peril and perhaps not even feasible
[00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:55.560]   I think it's a correct political statement. I would like
[00:15:55.560 --> 00:16:01.800]   Come on so good big bag google shouldn't be promoting gmail. How awful of you we're gonna
[00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:07.240]   We're gonna take your software that you created google and we're gonna use it against you could be with you because you're so evil
[00:16:07.880 --> 00:16:11.480]   You want to do that it's not that they shouldn't be promoting it
[00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:16.360]   It's just that over the past four to six years since we've had android
[00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:18.840]   They have flipped it around and
[00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:23.320]   Talk out of both sides of their mouths where they say oh android it's all open
[00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:26.920]   But in fact it's not open if you want to call it android
[00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:34.360]   If you want to call it android use that trade about android the other complaint about android is that it forked in too many variations
[00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:36.360]   And the fragmentation was awful
[00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:39.800]   So so people praised google for bringing some control back to android
[00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:44.440]   There's a difference there's a difference between bringing control back into android and another different
[00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:46.920]   There's a difference between saying we're gonna have a set of guidelines
[00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:51.080]   You should follow for good android operating system and saying hey
[00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:57.880]   If you want us to license you out so you can call yourself android and then be able to have our google play services
[00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:02.280]   You have to sign this agreement with the samsung that says you got to put google on the front page of this
[00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:04.840]   You got to put all this stuff over here and all these other things
[00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:11.400]   As opposed to all the friends that wasn't about that wasn't about making sure that we had a consistent android experience
[00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:14.600]   That was about making sure we had a consistent google experience
[00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:19.160]   But I know that's where I think you see some of the the frustration that comes in
[00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:24.120]   You know that they want to play the open card as google often does when it sounds good
[00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:29.000]   When they're competing against somebody who's not dominant and they've done this many times
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.720]   And then when they get dominant suddenly opens out the window you've never you know
[00:17:33.720 --> 00:17:38.600]   Ever seen the network one last thing you have never for all the google want to talk about openness
[00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:40.840]   You have never seen them say hey
[00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:45.640]   We should have the open web index initiative where we'll have one big crawler
[00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:50.440]   Everybody goes out there and gets this data and then anybody can build search applications on top
[00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:55.160]   It's because they've got you know they own that so they don't know sense of making that open
[00:17:55.160 --> 00:18:01.640]   But I think you're mixing apples and apples and convocles there that's not so much a question if you just stick with android
[00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:03.640]   um
[00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:07.560]   You know what what I don't get is the attitude the cyanogen
[00:18:07.560 --> 00:18:12.840]   Announcement a company makes up where we're talking about apple this way apple will lose crap
[00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:16.200]   Right or or or they do at such a lower level
[00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:20.920]   Of the of the toolkit that you can use but it doesn't doesn't have any of the value
[00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:23.320]   Who has an operandi?
[00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:25.880]   I'm in the position of defending google again. I don't always want to be here, but
[00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:30.200]   Because it's because apple made any other degree
[00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:37.960]   Because apple made apple never made any pretense of saying hey ios. It's the open operating system. Everybody can use
[00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:45.480]   But people did and so it's more pr thing right
[00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:47.960]   That you know it's a nice thing to poke at them
[00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:52.600]   It's not going to make much of a difference for you know the typical person who's going to buy a phone
[00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:58.680]   I don't think they're going oh, I don't want to buy this android phone because that was google and they didn't tie it in with all
[00:18:58.680 --> 00:19:02.440]   You know, there's like what's the best phone the lots of people are using that it's affordable that
[00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:05.640]   It has the key apps that I want to run and in the
[00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:12.600]   Go ahead try to tune the same antigen announce, but it's the attitude of acting is of google's bad
[00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:18.760]   By by doing what's in its interest and now i'm going to take the the the o s that google gives me for free
[00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:23.640]   By the way and now i'm going to turn it against google because google is somehow bad for promoting its own stuff
[00:19:26.280 --> 00:19:32.360]   The reason i get upset about this is the same thing in europe where the well google promotes its own promotes youtube
[00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:36.920]   Of course they do and spiegel doesn't promote focus and focus doesn't promote spiegel
[00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:43.320]   But there's this different expectation somehow that google and android should do that if you want to fully open o s
[00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:47.800]   Then make a firefox phone make it make up make a linux phone fine
[00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:53.960]   Google's a company what's so what's so bloody surprising about this they they are a company but it is
[00:19:54.840 --> 00:20:02.040]   A company that is inconsistent with its messaging to say you can't have our services on your version of android
[00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:08.440]   Right and that's what they do because if you if you're going to create you know, hey androids free
[00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:10.040]   Everybody can use it
[00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:15.240]   But if you're building a version that we think is going to be too popular or going to threaten our version and the control
[00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:18.440]   We want to have over ours. We will not let you have our services
[00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:22.920]   That is not crappy Danny or is going to be bad. What if it's really great?
[00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:28.520]   Leave it to the users to figure that out if it's crappy the users won't buy it but to say I can't show me
[00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:35.080]   Because it doesn't use google way. No, I can't get my hands on one. I don't know I can I can tell you it's not
[00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:37.000]   um
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.640]   McMaster says we believe 35 plus percent of android today is non google android
[00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:43.480]   Obviously a lot of that is china
[00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:47.880]   But we believe that trend is going to continue that 50 plus of the market will be non google
[00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:54.440]   Android he wants to capture 20 percent of that. We're making a version of android that is more open
[00:20:54.440 --> 00:21:00.840]   This to me this to me is what's interesting so admittedly by the way and I I acknowledge this
[00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:06.600]   Cyanogen built on a OSP which google which we you know google created in effect
[00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:14.280]   Yeah, I mean Andy Rubin created android before there was google but then google bought it and it's been google. It's from you know building it
[00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:19.240]   Um, so thank you google for that, but I don't think that there's anything wrong with saying
[00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:21.160]   you
[00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:24.360]   That we're going to take this open version of android
[00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:30.360]   And make it oh and continue it and make it be better. That's all finally. Oh, I think that's all fine
[00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:32.440]   What got me immediately announced what was the attitude
[00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:39.480]   It was the attitude of saying google's bad for promoting google's own products in its own product that we're also allowing you to use for free
[00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:41.800]   I think it could I think it was ungracious
[00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:45.240]   I think it was I think it was hubristic. I'm looking at his statements
[00:21:45.240 --> 00:21:50.680]   I I think that might have been an analysis by other authors. I don't
[00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:56.440]   Well, he does say android today as as I mentioned is a shell for google services
[00:21:56.440 --> 00:22:00.200]   He says he wants to move away from google. He's treating google as bad
[00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:05.320]   That's all see the notion of what google now is can be taken to the next level because we leveraged other services
[00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:09.160]   It can become complementary rather than just google's services
[00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:11.960]   um
[00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:16.120]   It's fine. It's just it's just I don't I don't have a problem with the fork
[00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:22.440]   Sensitive is this european thing that I'm just back from europe where I hear all this crap about how dare google
[00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:25.000]   Ever promote youtube
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:30.040]   Um, you know, and of course if you go back ask for maps in google you'll get competitors maps right up there
[00:22:30.040 --> 00:22:36.040]   And it's just it's a ridiculous argument the issue and so people understand it is that unfortunately
[00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:41.640]   Uh, while there does exist this aosp this open version of android it doesn't have
[00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:45.320]   A very critical piece google of the google services
[00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:49.800]   Which most apps rely on or many apps rely on to do what they do
[00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:56.600]   So most apps won't work or many apps many of the apps you want won't work on aosp without considerable modification
[00:22:56.600 --> 00:23:02.840]   I think what cyanogen's proposing which would be great is to provide an alternate set of services
[00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:10.520]   That aren't google specific so that developers who are writing, you know, the next, uh, serie or instagram
[00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:12.520]   could
[00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:16.680]   Have a choice and maybe and I if I were developer I depending on how different it is if it's
[00:23:16.680 --> 00:23:20.360]   Uh, if it's a similar api, maybe develop both versions
[00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:24.920]   So that there's an opportunity and you know what he says is when you're a developer
[00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:26.520]   um
[00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:33.320]   You would like more options than just creating a stupid little application that inevitably gets acquired by google or app
[00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:36.920]   He says these companies can thrive on a non google android
[00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:40.680]   But I also hear developers complaining about having a right for too many platform
[00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:43.320]   No, that's a choice. I mean that's because they feel like
[00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:48.600]   I mean that you can make look, uh, there there's firefox os there are many other
[00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:51.960]   Phone os's but andrew is a pretty good os
[00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:58.200]   Uh, and the only thing that makes it not open right now is that without google services. It's not complete
[00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:03.000]   And I think if they wrote as as uh lutheran art charam says
[00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:06.440]   An api compatible version of google services. Maybe that would be
[00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:12.680]   It's funny because oracle and a google are in a fight over whether an api can be copyrighted
[00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:19.240]   This would be interesting to see google on the other side of that fight with sianich and sianichan duplicates google's android api
[00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:23.000]   Uh just as google duplicated the java api
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:29.240]   Uh and is getting sued by oracle. I think that would be a good thing. I don't think nobody's making developers
[00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:34.280]   Choose it's just it's just providing an alternative for somebody who wants a true open source
[00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:37.160]   phone system
[00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:40.360]   Or or mobile operating system. I like that idea
[00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:44.520]   Boy, I didn't think this would be such a good conversation. No
[00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:46.840]   Who knew
[00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:48.920]   I was just touching on that. I was gonna move on
[00:24:48.920 --> 00:24:54.120]   Anyway, I
[00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:59.080]   We'll see you know, I agree with you. I mean no amazon did nobody any benefit by creating
[00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:02.040]   It's fork of android. It's good for amazon
[00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:08.840]   But what if somebody did create a fork of uh android that was more open and designed to be open
[00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:11.240]   I think that would be great and obviously
[00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:17.720]   CM sianichan thinks there's a way to make money off of it, which is fine. I guess they're business. They have to
[00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:24.680]   Um, I wonder what the open source's community response is to this maybe the open source communities. Well, who should be creating an api?
[00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:26.680]   Uh
[00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:30.600]   Wasn't there a case though? Where what was the what was the deal with india where you couldn't do sianichan?
[00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:33.800]   cyanogen sold exclusive one mark and they've talked
[00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:39.960]   It's my energy shouldn't be on such a high horse. No, no, no, no, they're they're actually pissed off because uh apparently
[00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:41.880]   Um
[00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:44.280]   They something happened they didn't expect
[00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:51.480]   So the deal the deal was who is it? Who's the other company in this one? I can't remember Jason house the android export expert
[00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:55.960]   Yeah, let's see here. It was uh, well, it was one plus and it was was a media tech or maybe yeah
[00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:59.400]   It was an indian company and apparently what sianichan said is what you know
[00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:03.080]   We or one plus said is we didn't it was a timing thing
[00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:07.960]   We didn't realize they were so close to market and so one plus got out it ousted from the
[00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:14.840]   Micro max micro max because micro max apparently had an exclusive with cyanogen, but cyanogen said well, we didn't
[00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:20.200]   This wasn't our plan. I mean, it is if you say you're open that doesn't go for exclusive deals
[00:26:20.760 --> 00:26:25.320]   Well, this is a difficult thing for them because they're also a business, right?
[00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:27.640]   So maybe it should be an open source
[00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:31.160]   Yes, so is google and why is so why not?
[00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:35.320]   So why what's so wrong then about cyanogen doing a fork?
[00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:39.160]   Nothing just don't attack google for it. That's all i'm saying
[00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:40.360]   Right
[00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:42.760]   That's all i'm saying do whatever you want and good luck
[00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:45.240]   And I don't think a fork of android is going to work terribly well
[00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:48.440]   If people want to develop to a whole new store unless you're going to you know
[00:26:48.440 --> 00:26:52.440]   Go into a developing country and really have marketing there to make it work. Good luck
[00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:55.560]   But in the us it's going to be niche of niche of niche of niche
[00:26:55.560 --> 00:27:00.360]   I'm just i'm going back to 2007 to the post where they announced
[00:27:00.360 --> 00:27:03.880]   android and actually what they announced was the open handset alliance
[00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:10.280]   And the post is full of things like the first truly open and comprehensive platform for mobile devices
[00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:14.440]   That through these deep partnerships of carriers and manufacturers developers and others
[00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:20.040]   We hope to enable an open ecosystem for the mobile world by creating a standard open mobile software platform
[00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:22.360]   We think this will be better faster pace
[00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:25.800]   That was 2007 since that time we saw google say things like
[00:27:25.800 --> 00:27:29.880]   Don't use sky hooks location services use our location services
[00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:32.520]   You can't have google play unless you do all this other stuff
[00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:39.720]   If you actually go to the open handset alliance home page the last what's new listing that they have on there is from 2011
[00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:42.360]   Right so
[00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:46.280]   There
[00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:51.880]   Was it bait and switch it was no what they really did was given away something free
[00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:58.040]   The issue was that it was free and that's what that was their business strategy. There's a difference in free and open
[00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:02.840]   No, no, absolutely. No, they have a business strategy of giving away things for free
[00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:05.800]   And have had that for a very long time that continues
[00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:11.080]   They have another business strategy of saying we're going to start some open initiative
[00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:14.520]   Which they always do when they're behind in an area
[00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:19.720]   And when they get into an area where they feel more secure the open stuff goes away
[00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:25.160]   And they just go and they close it down and they do things that benefit themselves though google
[00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:28.120]   And so and so I think that so I agree with you jeff, you know
[00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:29.240]   What's there's no problem?
[00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:34.360]   They want to have android and they want to say android is actually all this google stuff and all these sorts of things
[00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:37.880]   And the people who want to poke at them it's amusing to hear them poke at them
[00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:39.880]   It doesn't really make that much of a difference
[00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:44.360]   But the reason google gets poked that way is because they set themselves up for it
[00:28:44.360 --> 00:28:51.720]   That's good point daddy good point although google would probably still uh claim that it is open because it has the aosp
[00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:55.880]   The aosp really what what happened here is google google forked itself
[00:28:55.880 --> 00:29:02.840]   It created aosp which is the open thing and they still claim we do have an open uh version of android
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:09.800]   But then they went in this other direction the google version of android which is what everybody apparently wants now
[00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:13.480]   So the other open thing is is uh less desirable
[00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:16.600]   Jason is it there also a quality issue here too
[00:29:16.600 --> 00:29:19.880]   That and and a fragmentation issue
[00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:23.400]   So it's hard what we're asking about here is motive
[00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:30.040]   What part of this to google do because it was bait and switch what part of this to google do because the fragmentation was driving everybody crazy
[00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:33.560]   And there were quality issues around the android brand. I don't know the answer to that
[00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:36.840]   But it gets what you're what's what you're trying to grapple with
[00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:42.200]   It's a it's a long-standing debate is how open is is android?
[00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:45.800]   In the in the last hours of the show about um
[00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:49.960]   And i've actually changed my tune a little bit because i felt like well
[00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:54.840]   They're giving away source code, but what's become very clear is that aosp is a very weak
[00:29:55.720 --> 00:30:04.680]   If you're talking android android if you're talking android android is not open because android is a trademark that googles and google licenses
[00:30:04.680 --> 00:30:06.280]   so
[00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:12.440]   I you know aosp is not android which just happens to have the name android as part of the acronym
[00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:19.880]   That's part of the confusion isn't it you know and and but and they also get confusing because google will use stats when it to their benefit
[00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:23.640]   Google will tell you we don't control what the search is on android
[00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:28.840]   When they mean android osp and they'll point to something like an amazon as an example of that
[00:30:28.840 --> 00:30:31.880]   See well, we didn't control that and they're kind of right
[00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:37.320]   But not really because that's not really android google really google's building on
[00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:44.200]   The strength of google services and really wants you to use google services and you know what most consumers like jeff want google services
[00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:49.560]   That's what android means to them. Yeah, uh, just fine and and there's going to be some of those consumers
[00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:53.240]   We're like I don't want your weird forked weird thing of android
[00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:59.160]   I want this from google because you know, I know what i'm getting in the same way that they know that what they're getting when they get ios
[00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:02.520]   And that's what they want as well. So, you know, i'm not buying a fire phone
[00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:07.400]   No, but I do think there's room in the world and I encourage syanogen mod for
[00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:10.680]   aosp versions that have
[00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:14.600]   The same feature completeness as a google services version
[00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:19.640]   And uh, and as an alternative to google what's wrong with that here's what it does to me
[00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:26.120]   I would be happier. You see the people but for me who's not not you know geeky into the into the openness of the split
[00:31:26.120 --> 00:31:30.600]   I liked having a one plus one that operated as an android phone
[00:31:30.600 --> 00:31:35.720]   A one plus one that can't operate as an android phone because they've forked it. I got no interest in
[00:31:35.720 --> 00:31:38.920]   So I liked the idea of having competitive handsets
[00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:45.880]   competitive manufacturers that's when I was applauding syanogen for for coming up with alternatives within the ecosystem
[00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:49.880]   And now they're saying we're gonna move away from that ecosystem. Well, god bless them godspeed
[00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:54.120]   That's their business decision, but that takes me away from them because I have no interest in that
[00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:59.640]   Yeah, and it's ironic because of one of I love windows phone, but I can't use it because it doesn't support google services
[00:31:59.640 --> 00:32:02.680]   So, uh, there you go
[00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:05.560]   Which by the way one last thing
[00:32:05.560 --> 00:32:10.440]   Drively baddie because you know google is all about we're gonna again
[00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:13.560]   We want to have our stuff where people can get things or whatever and yet
[00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:18.440]   They just will not do anything for the windows platform with the exception of building a search app
[00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:23.880]   Because heaven forbid people not be able to do a google search on the windows when that is what they need to get fixed
[00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:30.120]   And I find it so disheartening because if you're using google voice or other google services
[00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:35.720]   You end up getting these third party apps and it's like well, am I trusting my password with them or you know
[00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:36.680]   What's happening with it?
[00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:41.960]   And I think it's a security issue that google ought to fix and it's not hard for them to develop something they want to do it
[00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:44.600]   Save any for windows
[00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:50.760]   I think it makes I think and I think you can make a strong case that it's an any competitive reason that google doesn't do it
[00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:53.960]   They could say well windows phones too small for us to spend the time on it
[00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:56.440]   It's not it's because it's microsoft and you don't like them
[00:32:56.760 --> 00:33:00.520]   Yeah, and they don't like you home skype on chrome skype on chrome
[00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:05.000]   That's microsoft doing something
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.720]   Bring skype on chrome or
[00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:12.440]   Microsoft will not do skype has not done this now making noises they will
[00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:17.480]   But but the reason i'm on this chrome book right now is and i'm on google plus right now
[00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:21.400]   Is because there's no skype on chrome because microsoft won't do it so the game works both ways
[00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:23.480]   Can you not do skype through the web?
[00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:29.160]   He can do skype he won't use a mac or windows
[00:33:29.160 --> 00:33:31.560]   He's assisting on using chrome OS
[00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:34.920]   But you can't do skype through the web a web skype
[00:33:34.920 --> 00:33:37.720]   I think that's the thing that they're going to do is a skype on the web
[00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:42.360]   I think that is coming but google's really solved that with with rt which I really like
[00:33:42.360 --> 00:33:45.800]   Uh, what's mccall it web what is it web rt?
[00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:47.800]   now
[00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:53.960]   RTC now i'm an acronym hell because i've been just did a microsoft show so i got rt on the brain
[00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:56.600]   Web rtc is that it oh yeah
[00:33:56.600 --> 00:34:01.320]   Let me take a break and get my brain into the google land into google land
[00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:05.320]   Uh our show today brought to you by
[00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:07.880]   The source of my toner cartridges

[00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:25.720]   You don't go to a car dealership to buy gas to use so i go back to the printer fact manufacturer to buy ink at toner
[00:34:25.720 --> 00:34:29.560]   Especially when you know they practically give away the printer because they're going to
[00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:32.840]   Rhenia on the ink or the toner
[00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:36.520]   ld products offers a quality alternative at a fraction of the cost

[00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:46.120]   They do sell oem cartridges and inks if you want to get them there at a very very aggressive price

[00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:28.680]   Should i start third party ink give it a try
[00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:31.960]   And by the way, these are remanufactured so it's good

[00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:35.400]   Um have you read so we're gonna try to make sense of this i've been trying now for a week
[00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:40.600]   We talked about this on twit. We've been talking about it on the mac break weekly zoey Keating
[00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:43.800]   She is a uh, cellist who uh
[00:36:43.800 --> 00:36:50.920]   Amazing amazing chalice a incredible artist. She does a lot of beautiful music and she has been using
[00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:54.200]   uh youtube to for two things
[00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:58.760]   Um one is she puts music up on youtube, but the other is
[00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:05.160]   There are thousands of people on youtube who are completely legally using her music. She encourages that
[00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:07.160]   Um
[00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:12.840]   Uh as as background effect the game of thrones special effects reel is uh is done
[00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:18.120]   Uh with a background of zoey Keating cello music, so it's very popular
[00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:22.680]   She she does that by turning on content id that's the google
[00:37:22.680 --> 00:37:29.720]   Uh automated thing that that listens to everything that's uploaded and says oh that's zoey Keating song notifies her
[00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:34.280]   And then uh she can decides whether she a if she doesn't like it
[00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:40.440]   She says i only only issue a takedown if it's hate or you know something really horrific that i don't want to be associated with
[00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:42.200]   most of the time
[00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:48.360]   Uh what she does is sharing the monetization. So if somebody's got ads on their youtube videos, she'll get some of the revenue from that
[00:37:48.360 --> 00:37:51.080]   She says that's a significant value to her
[00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:55.720]   She's sell most of her music uh income comes from stuff. She sells on iTunes
[00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:59.960]   And by the way, let me just uh i met zoey last year at Davos
[00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:05.400]   As part of a project i'm working on with the rolic on mac form on rethinking copyright at the next level
[00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:13.160]   And zoey is a tremendous example of someone who finds new business models who doesn't just sell content and restrict access to content
[00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:18.760]   Which is the old copyright model zoey says i want to have this kind of openness where people can use my stuff when i make money on it
[00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:24.360]   She wants data about who her fans are so she can deal with them in in in in valuable ways
[00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:32.520]   zoey is really visionary not only in her music but also in her view of creativity copyright and business models
[00:38:32.520 --> 00:38:35.720]   So she
[00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:38.920]   By the way is a very complicated story the original post
[00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:41.400]   It seems pretty clear, but then there've been
[00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:48.760]   Google's responded and says the stuff she says is patently false and she says well, please explain to me because i've been i've been negotiating this for a year
[00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:51.640]   She says that google called her and said, okay
[00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:59.880]   You have to sign on to the new youtube music services agreement or we will block your youtube channel google has since said no one said block
[00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:02.680]   But she's very clear in her memory of that
[00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:06.120]   Now this is if that's the case it's quite
[00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:07.800]   You know
[00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:15.720]   draconian because yeah all of her cattle these agreements music agreement means music key means that all of her catalog must be included
[00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:19.080]   In both free and premium music services
[00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:22.840]   Everything she does even if she does it elsewhere has to be included there
[00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:29.800]   Um, even if I don't deliver all my music because i'm a music partner anything that a third party uploads with my info in the description
[00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:32.520]   Will automatically be included in the music service too
[00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:37.320]   All song all song set to monetize she has no choice in that
[00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:43.160]   She seems to be that that's that's like a that's as if they're an old time studio
[00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:47.240]   Say you have to have an exclusive, but I don't know who's right on which side of this
[00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:50.360]   But but that's what really got me most about zoey's post was no
[00:39:50.360 --> 00:39:54.680]   I should have a full as an artist she should have a full choice of saying what goes where well
[00:39:54.680 --> 00:39:58.840]   She wants to say for instance release music on iTunes first and then put it on youtube
[00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:03.480]   She wants to but you the agreement says you have to release it on youtube the same time you're at least at anywhere else
[00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:06.760]   Uh, and it's five-year contract
[00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:13.640]   Um, she says this this is onerous and I kind of agree with her now google's response
[00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:16.760]   uh, which has been quoted by
[00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:19.480]   The guardian among others
[00:40:19.480 --> 00:40:21.800]   Um
[00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:23.800]   Is that will know
[00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:25.320]   Um
[00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:29.160]   Yeah, so I don't know who to believe on this. Uh, what did google say in essence?
[00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:34.040]   Well, I haven't read a response yet. Um, google says we never said we'd block you
[00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:38.200]   Um
[00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:42.920]   Google says we never said you couldn't just have content id and opt out of music key
[00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:46.440]   Um
[00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:53.320]   Is they say youtube is this is the guardian youtube is adam and it will not block musicians from uploading their music to its service
[00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:55.880]   Or running a channel if it doesn't make this agreement
[00:40:55.880 --> 00:41:01.640]   The company also says it is not stopping artists from releasing music on other platforms earlier than youtube
[00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:06.280]   So there's some debate over what she whether what she says google said they said
[00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:09.960]   She seems very clear that no they said this they said at more than one time
[00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:15.160]   I've been talking to a sales rep now. I have to say we've had conversations with sales reps from youtube
[00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:18.440]   Uh that have been completely goofy
[00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:23.800]   Uh, so I don't know how well trained or well informed these these sales reps actually are
[00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:26.680]   Um, you know, I mean
[00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:32.200]   The my experience talking to youtube we wanted to get on youtube live my experience with that was not positive at all
[00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:34.600]   We just threw up our hand said never mind
[00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:36.360]   Um
[00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:42.920]   YouTube says musicians who don't agree to its music key terms still have control over their content in terms of copyright
[00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:47.800]   They can still get videos videos that use their music without a license removed
[00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:52.280]   But it's not clear whether they can still use content id for that they might have to do it themselves
[00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:55.560]   Um
[00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:57.560]   Believe me
[00:41:57.560 --> 00:42:00.120]   Thousands of people using your music that's not
[00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:06.600]   I think the most disturbing thing about content id is content id wasn't designed as a way for
[00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:13.000]   Google to somehow try to force artists into putting things on youtube or to somehow
[00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:18.200]   Compel them into it content id is an anti-piracy thing and it's a it's a nice way
[00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:24.120]   For people to say all right. I don't have a problem people using my music and i'm going to make some money off of this
[00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:26.840]   So you use your content id and you can figure that sort of thing out
[00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:32.360]   And that really shouldn't be tied in with anything else that should just be something google's offering to anybody
[00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:36.840]   Who has worries that their content's being taken and used on youtube without permission
[00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:38.280]   Yeah, you're right danny
[00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:43.240]   And it was it was it was a really smooth good way around the copyright fight to say go with the flow
[00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:49.240]   And make money on it. Yeah, uh and rather than taking issue or take down notice issue a share notice basically
[00:42:49.240 --> 00:42:53.800]   And I agree. I think that's it's it's you kind of can't it's like it's like when the bank says
[00:42:53.800 --> 00:43:03.640]   You you have to use the automatic teller so you don't use tellers and then when you use the automatic teller they charge you to use the automatic teller
[00:43:03.640 --> 00:43:06.920]   You know, they're getting both ways. It's like an airline
[00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:08.840]   You can't have it both ways
[00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:13.720]   Content id was a very clever and good way to get around the content fight. So leave it at that. I agree
[00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:14.920]   So
[00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:16.840]   Keating has posted
[00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:23.560]   A follow-up post she posted it yesterday with a transcript of her conversation with the youtube representative
[00:43:23.560 --> 00:43:27.560]   Oh my confirming now. It's a transcript. It's not a recording
[00:43:27.560 --> 00:43:30.440]   Confirming everything she said
[00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:33.080]   She said she says for instance
[00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:36.840]   Well, if I wanted to just let content id keep doing its thing and it does a great job at it
[00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:44.520]   I'm totally happy with it and I don't want to participate in the music service is that an option the rep says that's unfortunately not an option
[00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:48.680]   That's where the crux of this is. Yeah, assuming I don't want to then what would occur?
[00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:55.640]   So what would happen um well so in the worst case scenario because we do understand there are cases where our partners don't want to participate for various reasons
[00:43:55.640 --> 00:44:01.560]   What we basically have to do is because the music terms are essentially like outdated the content
[00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:03.640]   This does sound like
[00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:05.800]   one of my favorites youtube reps the
[00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:11.640]   Um, uh, the content that you directly upload from accounts that you own under the content and owner attached to the agreement
[00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:13.640]   So we'll have to block that content
[00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:20.040]   But anything that comes up that we're able to scan and master content id we could just apply a track policy
[00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:24.680]   But the commercial terms no longer apply so there's not going to be any revenue generated
[00:44:24.680 --> 00:44:30.280]   So the rep says we will block your channel and you won't make any more money
[00:44:30.280 --> 00:44:34.760]   You can still use content id but you're not gonna make any more money. She says well, that's pretty harsh
[00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:40.120]   The rep says yeah, it's harsh and trust me. It's really difficult for me to have this conversation with all my partners
[00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:45.160]   But we're really what we're trying to do is basically create a new revenue stream on top of what exists on the platform today
[00:44:45.160 --> 00:44:54.200]   So unless zoey keating is lying and I take it from your experience for the rep is rep is misinformed and the rep could be freelancing
[00:44:54.200 --> 00:44:57.640]   Yeah, we don't know that and well
[00:44:57.640 --> 00:45:01.960]   I mean, this is a case where it would be great given the power of the twit network is to bring together
[00:45:01.960 --> 00:45:04.840]   From google and bring together zoey keating and say I'd love to do that
[00:45:04.840 --> 00:45:09.560]   Me me. Yeah, yeah what it yeah
[00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:12.040]   She says I
[00:45:12.040 --> 00:45:15.480]   You know, unfortunately her husband is very very ill right now
[00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:20.200]   And so she's focusing on that she says youtube is not at the top of my priority list right now
[00:45:20.200 --> 00:45:23.000]   So the fact that she's even been posting this is pretty impressive exactly
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:27.160]   She pulled back entirely from before me because the tragic diagnosis for her husband
[00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:31.640]   And she said she did say I was relieved to see this that he's somewhat stabilized and somewhat better
[00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:36.440]   That's why she's doing this now, but this is this the last thing she needs the last thing
[00:45:36.440 --> 00:45:38.600]   I don't you know, it doesn't feel good
[00:45:38.600 --> 00:45:41.800]   No, it doesn't I agree
[00:45:41.800 --> 00:45:44.520]   either youtube has
[00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:46.760]   sales reps who are freelancing
[00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:53.960]   And putting pressure on people much the same way Comcast has notoriously put pressure on its customers
[00:45:53.960 --> 00:45:56.280]   Which is a bad cultural thing, which is in good
[00:45:57.240 --> 00:45:58.840]   or
[00:45:58.840 --> 00:46:01.800]   Worse right the reps right and youtube's lying
[00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:05.400]   in to the press about what their deal is
[00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:09.320]   Either way, it doesn't look good for youtube
[00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:13.880]   No, um, so youtube is just I think with susan
[00:46:13.880 --> 00:46:14.840]   We're just key there now
[00:46:14.840 --> 00:46:18.280]   They're trying to get new senses of what the business of youtube is which is good
[00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:20.680]   Right, I think there's new opportunities
[00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:25.080]   But in the discussions I have with with publishers youtube's also an important thing for them
[00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:29.240]   And and you got to be able to rely on getting good deals with these
[00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:35.000]   uh, the case of you know, it's one matter to go to google news and say well, I
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:37.720]   I quoted your story or I mentioned your headline
[00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:43.960]   And that's not to my mind copyright theft, but in the case of a video and music it's very clear caught
[00:46:43.960 --> 00:46:48.600]   It's copyright protected and and there's no copy in there and there's no summarizing there
[00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:53.400]   It is it either is or isn't so youtube has to have pretty clear ways to deal with that
[00:46:54.040 --> 00:46:56.040]   And as danny just said
[00:46:56.040 --> 00:46:58.280]   Clotted idea was their way out of
[00:46:58.280 --> 00:47:01.080]   It was a response to the dmca
[00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:03.240]   Yeah
[00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:09.240]   There was a clever and good response. It was a great thing and look at the zoey was brilliantly saying okay
[00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:15.160]   I'll go with the flow. I'll allow people to create. I'll allow youtube to grow
[00:47:15.160 --> 00:47:21.080]   I won't do takedowns and I can make money kukukukuchu group hug. Yeah
[00:47:21.960 --> 00:47:26.920]   Well, but I think this betrays to me a little bit of of one of the things I've worried about with youtube
[00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:31.640]   Which is they really would love to entice artists to use youtube
[00:47:31.640 --> 00:47:39.400]   But only to the extent that they can make money on it and they're very happy to parade the handful of artists who make a ton of money on youtube
[00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:45.800]   But the truth is the vast majority do not youtube takes a very large portion of their revenue
[00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:48.680]   We don't know exactly how much but something like half
[00:47:49.560 --> 00:47:53.000]   And and in this case they're leveraging content id
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:57.240]   To strong arm somebody into assigning rights over to you
[00:47:57.240 --> 00:48:01.560]   I mean the issue is if if google wanted to offer an exclusive deal with with with
[00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:06.040]   improved shares and better benefits fine offer that
[00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:12.200]   but but to to strong arm from position of strength and say
[00:48:12.200 --> 00:48:17.400]   It's exclusive or nothing. That's like an old hollywood studio. That's not what we want in this world
[00:48:18.040 --> 00:48:20.040]   So I don't know what's true here
[00:48:20.040 --> 00:48:25.320]   Uh at the end of the day. I think i'm sensing from the guardian articles that
[00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:33.080]   No matter what happened in the negotiations prior to this youtube is starting to see that they're not necessarily in the best position
[00:48:33.080 --> 00:48:35.560]   So maybe the good will come out of this. I think it will
[00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:39.800]   Because i'm plus le for for being open about this. It's wildly complex
[00:48:39.800 --> 00:48:45.560]   Uh, you can't figure this out and there's no reason to end up at war with artists here
[00:48:45.800 --> 00:48:50.360]   Their desire in the end is is the contrary their desire is to have tons of artists come on youtube
[00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:52.520]   And succeed
[00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:57.480]   You nail it with the old media because the old media really sees content creators as uh
[00:48:57.480 --> 00:49:02.920]   A gold mine to be mine, you know as a as a field to be plowed
[00:49:02.920 --> 00:49:08.600]   Uh not as partners in any sense of the word. They're just you know, they're good for making us money until they're not
[00:49:08.600 --> 00:49:11.080]   There's always been and i'm has a long time
[00:49:11.800 --> 00:49:16.360]   Player and old media. I know this there's always been this antipathy between
[00:49:16.360 --> 00:49:19.640]   The owners and the content creators
[00:49:19.640 --> 00:49:22.200]   And if you know they don't like you
[00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:26.680]   And they're they're like you just long enough for you to make a money and after that they get rid of you as quick as they can
[00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:29.560]   And I would hate for youtube to be the uh to treat
[00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:32.040]   Creators that way
[00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:35.560]   They've certainly made noises in the opposite direction, but then now it looks like they're not
[00:49:36.600 --> 00:49:43.640]   At dld I interviewed samir aurora who's the ceo of of what is now called mode media, which part of which is glam
[00:49:43.640 --> 00:49:50.760]   And and i'll make this as short as I can glam is has become a seventh largest web property out there in full disclosure
[00:49:50.760 --> 00:49:52.760]   i've over the time
[00:49:52.760 --> 00:49:54.360]   advised glam
[00:49:54.360 --> 00:49:55.240]   And
[00:49:55.240 --> 00:50:00.520]   Who samir did this really neat chart? It's not my blog, but it's really hard to see and hard to get it's too complex
[00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:02.600]   But just to summarize it very simply
[00:50:03.320 --> 00:50:07.480]   If you add people to content if you add social to content
[00:50:07.480 --> 00:50:12.360]   Networks to content you scale in ways that were never possible with old media
[00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:20.520]   So the upper right quadrant highest media margin of his chart that he draws is companies that do not pay for
[00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:21.880]   um
[00:50:21.880 --> 00:50:23.880]   Content and do not pay for traffic
[00:50:23.880 --> 00:50:28.120]   Then below that a slight bit is companies that don't pay for traffic
[00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:30.520]   But do pay for content on a revenue share basis
[00:50:30.520 --> 00:50:34.600]   Which is to say when it makes money and in that he puts youtube and glam
[00:50:34.600 --> 00:50:36.680]   They share revenue when it makes money
[00:50:36.680 --> 00:50:40.840]   Then if you start going down the chart and go to the lower left you get to old time
[00:50:40.840 --> 00:50:43.640]   Media, that's that's the bad chart. That's a very old chart
[00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:48.600]   Uh, you get to a very old media companies. I think it's the third one down because that looks like cancer
[00:50:48.600 --> 00:50:55.080]   I don't like that chart at all. It did exactly this. Just one so then on the left you see places like time ink and
[00:50:55.080 --> 00:51:00.280]   Uh, you know old media companies where they pay for audience they market
[00:51:00.520 --> 00:51:03.880]   They also pay for content whether or not it makes money because that's what they have to do
[00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:10.040]   And so the margins on the upper right are are far better than old media the lower left
[00:51:10.040 --> 00:51:16.760]   So youtube is up there trying to invent right new models where you enable huge amounts of content
[00:51:16.760 --> 00:51:19.800]   You don't pay for it except when it makes money
[00:51:19.800 --> 00:51:26.360]   The the social nature and the viral nature of things you don't pay for marketing it markets itself. The audience does that
[00:51:26.600 --> 00:51:31.880]   It's a very high margin business extremely high margin. It's a good business. It's a platform business
[00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:36.760]   We like that. So then you've got to operate like a platform. You've got to be open enough
[00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:41.080]   Otherwise, if you start shutting down the platform, you're just turning yourself into
[00:51:41.080 --> 00:51:46.840]   You know a wall garden and aol a time ink, you know pick who it is funny. They used to be together
[00:51:46.840 --> 00:51:52.760]   So I've never been sold on the youtube model. I've always felt like that this was really more of an old
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:56.040]   Media model in sheep's clothing. That's where we disagree
[00:51:56.040 --> 00:52:02.040]   I think I think youtube can it has been can be and can remain a platform. I would love that where
[00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:05.720]   And it doesn't have to be blockbuster blockbuster
[00:52:05.720 --> 00:52:10.280]   Uh people can make money, but where there is is there a long tail on youtube
[00:52:10.280 --> 00:52:13.560]   Yes, okay, sure sure
[00:52:13.560 --> 00:52:15.880]   So so smaller
[00:52:15.880 --> 00:52:19.240]   Titles can well our guys can make something and the other part of this is
[00:52:20.120 --> 00:52:25.560]   Again, this goes back to the copyright work I've been doing with with role economic forum, which we now expanding to other industries
[00:52:25.560 --> 00:52:30.120]   It's not just selling content. It's always a great example of this right?
[00:52:30.120 --> 00:52:36.360]   Zoe says I want to sell concert tickets. I want data about my users so I can have a great relationship with them and they'll be loyal to me
[00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:43.320]   I want to uh allow other people to use my my music and thank you youtube. You'll help me identify that and make money from that
[00:52:43.320 --> 00:52:48.200]   Uh, what what youtube and google should and and facebook at all should want
[00:52:48.920 --> 00:52:53.960]   Is content creators who do explore and can exploit new business models
[00:52:53.960 --> 00:53:00.680]   Uh because if they find themselves supporting only the old business model of owning and controlling content
[00:53:00.680 --> 00:53:05.240]   Well, then they're back into the clutches of the old media companies that especially in europer giving them help
[00:53:05.240 --> 00:53:08.840]   Yeah, so the more you encourage and enable multiple business models
[00:53:08.840 --> 00:53:14.200]   Uh more flexible legal and technical frameworks the better off you are so youtube in the long run
[00:53:14.200 --> 00:53:19.240]   I think it's smart enough to see that they what zoey key to succeed they want many zoey key things
[00:53:19.240 --> 00:53:24.680]   It's better off if they have a bunch of zoey key things in addition to some warner musics
[00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:28.520]   Well, I would hope they're smart enough. They don't seem to be actually
[00:53:28.520 --> 00:53:31.960]   Their actions don't seem to be living up to that, but I would hope so and
[00:53:31.960 --> 00:53:35.880]   It's you know, we should we should you know the way this resolves will tell us a lot, won't it?
[00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:41.080]   I used to have an old city editor who had a tickle file as he called it and he put something in a file and say
[00:53:41.080 --> 00:53:45.800]   Six months I'm gonna look this up in three months. I'm gonna look this up. Yeah, this is a story where we should we should val
[00:53:45.800 --> 00:53:49.240]   Jason if you've got a calendar to put this in here. We should come back in
[00:53:49.240 --> 00:53:56.600]   Two months and see what's happened with this one. I would hope this is not a similar case to the android conversation
[00:53:56.600 --> 00:54:04.040]   We had earlier or youtube goes oh, it's open. It's free. It's wonderful and as soon as they get you in their web boom
[00:54:04.040 --> 00:54:07.960]   We got you. I would hope that this isn't a trend
[00:54:08.680 --> 00:54:14.360]   Other dip that's all right Facebook just posted that they had three billion views per day a video as part of their
[00:54:14.360 --> 00:54:17.880]   That's the thing. I mean there aren't isn't aren't there not that Facebook wouldn't be any better
[00:54:17.880 --> 00:54:21.480]   But I do think there are other choices. There's vimeo. There's other places
[00:54:21.480 --> 00:54:25.080]   And that I would hope to be enough competition
[00:54:25.080 --> 00:54:31.480]   I'm sure that's if google is being evil. That's the calculus. Well, how long do we have to appear open before?
[00:54:31.480 --> 00:54:34.440]   to close down the other guys and then
[00:54:35.560 --> 00:54:42.840]   Well, but that's where daddy's point is right facebook coming looming there with video plays right what youtube that youtube has a monetization structure
[00:54:42.840 --> 00:54:47.240]   It goes to the then it goes to the broader issue of you know
[00:54:47.240 --> 00:54:50.200]   If you're zoey keating you want to be on facebook
[00:54:50.200 --> 00:54:55.400]   But you know google was a search company that was both the point you towards content
[00:54:55.400 --> 00:54:58.760]   Now google is a media company that wants to own and control its own content
[00:54:58.760 --> 00:55:03.480]   And then it gets it is and it has we have this fight danny
[00:55:04.520 --> 00:55:08.600]   Jeff and I have this fight all the time because I agree with you. They don't really own the content
[00:55:08.600 --> 00:55:16.040]   They they own pages that they drive people to where they want to have people land
[00:55:16.040 --> 00:55:18.680]   And so, you know, that's
[00:55:18.680 --> 00:55:26.920]   That's that that they are in competition with other people in their own search engine and i'm not talking they're in competition with yelp
[00:55:26.920 --> 00:55:30.920]   I'm not talking the absurd argument. Oh, well, they're fighting with other search engines
[00:55:30.920 --> 00:55:34.600]   I'm meaning like if I do a search for watch game of thrones
[00:55:34.600 --> 00:55:39.320]   I'm gonna just do it right now and I get my ad that comes up. I get an ad and google plays
[00:55:39.320 --> 00:55:42.360]   They're not making danny. Here's the difference. They're not making
[00:55:42.360 --> 00:55:46.680]   Uh war of thrones to compete with game of thrones whereas amazon
[00:55:46.680 --> 00:55:52.600]   Yeah, no, but they're listing themselves before itunes and they're lifting themselves before amazon
[00:55:52.600 --> 00:55:55.480]   And they're in fact they're listing themselves before hbo
[00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:02.920]   You know or they want to have a music service and a video service that competes with these other services and uh
[00:56:02.920 --> 00:56:10.600]   And it probably makes sense and probably inevitable that they had to go that way, but it's difficult when you're also supposedly running a search
[00:56:10.600 --> 00:56:17.320]   Still search for game of thrones search for game of thrones. What's the first thing that comes up google play 299 an episode
[00:56:17.320 --> 00:56:24.760]   No, I searched for google google game of thrones and hbo.com log out of your log out of your customization. I see hbo too, but
[00:56:24.760 --> 00:56:26.920]   Watch game of thrones
[00:56:27.640 --> 00:56:31.560]   You're right if I search for game of thrones. I'm getting just game of thrones the site that's coming up
[00:56:31.560 --> 00:56:36.280]   Yeah, I get hbo. Yeah, they offer a service. I don't have any problem with them saying hey
[00:56:36.280 --> 00:56:40.200]   You can watch it on play, but if i'm searching for game of thrones hbo comes up first
[00:56:40.200 --> 00:56:42.600]   Well, yeah, because that's the game of thrones website
[00:56:42.600 --> 00:56:48.440]   Yeah, but if we're talking about somebody how about try buy game of thrones. That might be a really good one
[00:56:48.440 --> 00:56:52.840]   Let's see where I I can buy game of thrones at number one amazon
[00:56:53.960 --> 00:56:56.360]   Okay, then best buy then forbs
[00:56:56.360 --> 00:57:03.080]   With an article then stored out hbo effect. I it's way down on actually number one go back up
[00:57:03.080 --> 00:57:07.080]   Isn't that is there's the ad but then this is the first result
[00:57:07.080 --> 00:57:12.280]   Out you see over on your right hand side the shop for buy a game of thrones. Yeah, there's all the google play stuff
[00:57:12.280 --> 00:57:15.160]   Yeah, those from me, but that's an ad from google play. It says sponsor
[00:57:15.160 --> 00:57:19.960]   I it doesn't matter that it's an ad for game of thrones. You know, it's still them. Look at it
[00:57:19.960 --> 00:57:22.040]   It's google plays coming up. It's also prettier
[00:57:22.120 --> 00:57:24.120]   By the way
[00:57:24.120 --> 00:57:29.560]   Danny go that's a conflict of interest Jeff land up there. That's a classic conflict of interest
[00:57:29.560 --> 00:57:32.520]   What why if we always not gonna put a whole land up
[00:57:32.520 --> 00:57:38.520]   They're the they're a company they do what companies know because show time makes it. That's all again
[00:57:38.520 --> 00:57:40.520]   I know i'm coming off like a fan boy
[00:57:40.520 --> 00:57:45.800]   But it's not because their business which they make most of their money off of still
[00:57:45.800 --> 00:57:51.960]   Is providing people the ability to locate information across the web in a manner that's supposed to be
[00:57:51.960 --> 00:57:59.240]   untrusted and it's supposed to be trusted and biased and not skewed and the listings are but they've always had ads
[00:57:59.240 --> 00:58:05.800]   They have ads but they also have their own content that competes with other people and it's like not really google
[00:58:05.800 --> 00:58:11.400]   No, I'm just gonna still it's not really content. They don't have war of thrones. They don't have their own show
[00:58:11.400 --> 00:58:16.520]   What if they don't own show and I would imagine this is just around the corner does as Netflix amazon and others have done
[00:58:16.520 --> 00:58:19.160]   And starts making its own content with that changer too
[00:58:19.800 --> 00:58:22.520]   Because then then danny's gonna come back to me and say nyan
[00:58:22.520 --> 00:58:26.040]   He would be right
[00:58:26.040 --> 00:58:28.040]   I'm right because they haven't done it yet
[00:58:28.040 --> 00:58:33.480]   Okay, I don't see a difference between them. We don't make the content and
[00:58:33.480 --> 00:58:37.480]   We sell it the content right they they have destinations
[00:58:37.480 --> 00:58:42.920]   That's the thing to me do they have a place where they're trying to send you that's back within the google network
[00:58:42.920 --> 00:58:48.360]   As opposed to sending you outside of google and when they started it would be cleaner have things
[00:58:48.440 --> 00:58:52.760]   It really would be you can't disagree with this jeff it would be cleaner if google were just a search engine
[00:58:52.760 --> 00:58:56.840]   That they do muddy the waters a little bit by having well
[00:58:56.840 --> 00:59:02.840]   But we get into that leo right off the bat when I ask for an airline and they give me the airline data
[00:59:02.840 --> 00:59:07.560]   Then the airline industry says, you know saber and people like that say what you're screwing me
[00:59:07.560 --> 00:59:13.560]   But google says we're getting it right to the information you want not forcing you to go through five other pages with five other ways
[00:59:13.560 --> 00:59:15.880]   As a consumer i'll take
[00:59:16.440 --> 00:59:19.880]   The difference and the difference is if you do a search
[00:59:19.880 --> 00:59:26.120]   And this is what I mean about the absurdity of search engines complaining about google beating with them as opposed to
[00:59:26.120 --> 00:59:30.760]   Content destinations or brands or owners or people who own and operate stuff
[00:59:30.760 --> 00:59:33.480]   If I do a search and i'm trying to find a flight
[00:59:33.480 --> 00:59:39.160]   Presenting me with search results is not necessarily good for expedia
[00:59:39.160 --> 00:59:46.120]   But it's not taking away the ability for me to then still book the flight through the people who really matter the airlines
[00:59:46.680 --> 00:59:48.920]   Google's job is to connect me with
[00:59:48.920 --> 00:59:55.240]   What I want and if and and to connect me to publishers and brands and people who have the services that I need
[00:59:55.240 --> 01:00:02.280]   So the fact that if I do a search on google and I don't have to go then to expedia and then have to go through another step to get to the things
[01:00:02.280 --> 01:00:05.800]   Is much different than if I do a search on google and
[01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:12.840]   They send me off to google play where they make their own money as opposed to pointing me over to itunes or amazon
[01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:17.640]   With the same exact service to do point me to amazon danny they do point me to amazon
[01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:21.320]   Yes, the search is right there. They point me to amazon first thing
[01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:28.360]   For some things not all things all right. This is an argument that will never end so i'm gonna put it on pause
[01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:30.680]   We have this all the time and I love this argument
[01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:34.920]   Uh facebook's revenue is coming in. Well, that's what danny was referring to
[01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:40.680]   Some information from facebook huge just huge engagement
[01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:47.000]   Uh, what what revenue look like uh, let's see revenue and billion dollars
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:54.440]   But and how about profit net income a little bit less profit profit profit schmuffet
[01:00:54.440 --> 01:00:59.720]   Who cares about profit and then here from facebook
[01:00:59.720 --> 01:01:08.040]   And uh the uh utengo your tango folks just a little uh promotional announcement on responsible relationships
[01:01:08.680 --> 01:01:13.080]   And you five billion comes with five billion alice
[01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:15.960]   She's putting five actually computing machine
[01:01:15.960 --> 01:01:22.840]   And looks to see what her friends have been up to on facebook the electric friendship generator
[01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:29.240]   She checks in to see what timmy's been up to asks and timmy have been going steady for six months
[01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:31.400]   That's funny
[01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:33.880]   Timmy changed his relationship status from
[01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:36.440]   in a relationship
[01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:41.960]   Too single even more curious. He became friends with dana white house
[01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:43.160]   at
[01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:45.160]   207 a.m
[01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:51.960]   Came in just bungled rule number one of facebook relationship etiquette
[01:01:51.960 --> 01:01:54.520]   Don't change your relationships
[01:01:54.520 --> 01:02:01.560]   I'll uh leave the rest as an exercise to the viewer poor timmy. He just he just doesn't get it. Does he?
[01:02:01.560 --> 01:02:04.200]   this episode of
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:10.520]   69 of ad revenue in the fourth quarter parse that stuff i'm gonna do an ad while you read the facebook results
[01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:13.000]   Okay, and uh we'll let timmy just hang
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:20.520]   Shame on you timmy
[01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:25.800]   This episode of twig brought to you by personal capital. I love personal capital
[01:02:25.800 --> 01:02:29.080]   In fact, I know somebody who uh is finally
[01:02:29.880 --> 01:02:34.600]   Like fed up with their investment advisor. She was saying I didn't I lost money this year

[01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:20.920]   I just broke facebook relationship etiquette rule number two
[01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:33.320]   Oh my my so much to learn from this video so much to learn
[01:04:33.320 --> 01:04:41.800]   All right facebook's results are in what was the rev the profit was 10 billion for the quarter
[01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:45.720]   revenue grew of 49 percent in the fourth quarter
[01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:48.840]   um
[01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:58.040]   Ended when's the ended 2004 with 1.39 billion monthly users what wait let's get that one let's get that one out right at front
[01:04:58.040 --> 01:05:01.000]   This is their new
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.880]   Active monthly active user number remember when
[01:05:03.880 --> 01:05:09.800]   Six percent of them remember i'm assessing on smartphones and other mobile devices remember when it was like oh facebook
[01:05:09.800 --> 01:05:12.440]   100 million users. Oh facebook
[01:05:12.440 --> 01:05:14.920]   300 million years oh facebook a billion
[01:05:15.400 --> 01:05:20.520]   1.39 billion active users every month
[01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:24.360]   86 mobile and almost all of a mobile
[01:05:24.360 --> 01:05:30.760]   Mobile adds a conference 39 percent of ad remember that was the other thing when facebook went public oh they haven't cracked mobile
[01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:34.680]   They'll never figure out how to make money and mobile. Oh, they can't make money. Wow
[01:05:34.680 --> 01:05:38.920]   Uh, wow
[01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:40.600]   That's pretty impressive
[01:05:40.600 --> 01:05:45.320]   86 percent mode growth was exceeded by its operating expenses which grew roughly
[01:05:45.320 --> 01:05:51.960]   87 percent as a result of sharp increases in research and development costs and marketing and sales spending and mark doesn't care at all
[01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:54.600]   Nope, that's fine
[01:05:54.600 --> 01:05:57.480]   We're in investment mode
[01:05:57.480 --> 01:06:05.080]   Facebook's uh overall revenue rose to 3.85 billion from 2.59 billion in the year ago period
[01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:10.040]   Wow, uh, that's 54 cents a share versus the analyst estimate of 49
[01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:14.520]   So they're not making a huge amount of money. Um, you know a billion a quarter
[01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:16.760]   but
[01:06:16.760 --> 01:06:17.800]   They're growing
[01:06:17.800 --> 01:06:23.400]   They're growing it's the amazon world. Yeah, hey, but it's better than amazon because amazon had many many many quarters where they made no money
[01:06:23.400 --> 01:06:26.120]   Facebook's taken a little off the top each month
[01:06:26.120 --> 01:06:29.160]   Yeah, just to pay the rent
[01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:35.320]   Wow, by the way, they have 11.2 billion dollars in cash
[01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:41.640]   So their position is good for and nothing like apple, but their position is good for acquisitions. What's what's apples cash? No?
[01:06:41.640 --> 01:06:48.200]   Oh, it's well over 130 billion something like that. It's it's a big number. I don't remember apple by the way just
[01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:56.360]   They announced their revenue last last yesterday and they uh, they are now they've made more money less quarter than any company in the history of human
[01:06:58.520 --> 01:07:01.640]   That's a license to steal. Wow
[01:07:01.640 --> 01:07:07.000]   Jesus more money than they're they beat these russian
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:13.400]   Gazprom the natural gas conglomerate from russia and for quarterly profits
[01:07:13.400 --> 01:07:16.840]   They made more money than any
[01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:24.360]   Company in the history of the world last quarter. I see this now. They made more than god dot com made more than god dot com
[01:07:28.040 --> 01:07:32.680]   And I you know facebook isn't that kind of uh, you know profitability, but that's okay
[01:07:32.680 --> 01:07:38.600]   Because they're making a you know billion of quarters ain't not not bad and they're and they're growing like crazy
[01:07:38.600 --> 01:07:43.800]   Very interesting and they but the main thing to me is they licked that mobile thing
[01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:50.200]   Which was which was really just and I think more impressive than than where google is on that with the advertising end
[01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:53.480]   Yep, nobody thought they could monetize mobile
[01:07:54.200 --> 01:07:57.560]   This is a matter of what what samira at glam said that mode says to
[01:07:57.560 --> 01:08:01.400]   What the the next thing he argues is streams
[01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:05.160]   So facebook understands streams twitter understands streams
[01:08:05.160 --> 01:08:10.280]   Google doesn't really have streams they tried to google plus and I still like google plus laugh at me if you will
[01:08:10.280 --> 01:08:12.440]   But that's the closest thing they have to stream
[01:08:12.440 --> 01:08:18.520]   uh, whereas facebook is in streams or mobile and and streams with ads inserted
[01:08:18.520 --> 01:08:23.400]   Uh, that's what's working for now. I don't know how long that's gonna go, but that's working for now
[01:08:23.400 --> 01:08:27.000]   You think facebook will ever have a revenue sharing system like youtube does
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:29.480]   I mean, here's an opportunity for you were talking about this danny
[01:08:29.480 --> 01:08:32.680]   There's an opportunity for facebook here for people like zoy keating if they offer them
[01:08:32.680 --> 01:08:37.080]   Uh monetization could facebook do that would facebook do that?
[01:08:37.080 --> 01:08:41.640]   Uh, I think they they could you know, order could drive people back to their pages
[01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:46.520]   I mean the the difficulty is that facebook doesn't have like a kind of music service in the way that
[01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:52.760]   You know google does and I think one of the things that kind of saves facebook from the issues that google has had with youtube is that
[01:08:53.320 --> 01:08:54.920]   You don't typically go to facebook
[01:08:54.920 --> 01:09:00.280]   I think and do your searching for videos in fact I can't even I have to go back and see if video works
[01:09:00.280 --> 01:09:03.880]   Right, you know people go to youtube because they think I want to hear this song
[01:09:03.880 --> 01:09:09.880]   You search for it you find the song and you play it and facebook is much more about video discovery and
[01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:14.680]   Pushing out the videos that they want so they could make zoe a star
[01:09:14.680 --> 01:09:17.720]   You know if they decide they wanted to make her a star by saying, right?
[01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:20.760]   Let's let's make sure we're pushing more of her her things that are out there
[01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:27.160]   But it's certainly giving you know people who are doing videos a new area to to be exposed
[01:09:27.160 --> 01:09:30.920]   But I still think it's a bit different than the way people sometimes find things on youtube
[01:09:30.920 --> 01:09:35.640]   And of course you have people who tune into youtube channels just because I want to hear this from a particular thing
[01:09:35.640 --> 01:09:41.960]   And of course so eating does have a facebook page and you can like her, but there's no rev share back to her
[01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:46.360]   It's purely promotion there is an opportunity there Danny and I were at a conference called newsgeist
[01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:54.040]   A few months ago where where danny was brilliant and one of the things we talked about there was putting content in containers so that you can embed it
[01:09:54.040 --> 01:10:01.000]   And if you could embed something onto facebook and onto twitter and onto google plus and keep your business model
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.800]   At some level with that
[01:10:03.800 --> 01:10:09.720]   Then I think that opens up a tremendous amount for content creators across these services now world of services do it
[01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:13.240]   One thing we talked to google about that me was saying well, you know google plus
[01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:17.720]   You know, so it's not taking the world over so you couldn't you could sorry my lights went on
[01:10:17.720 --> 01:10:22.120]   You know you could use google plus as a way to kind of push
[01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:27.080]   Facebook and twitter a bit and and and do best practice with content creators
[01:10:27.080 --> 01:10:31.400]   I like given the discussion. We just had about youtube youtube being an embeddable
[01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:35.160]   Content container with a business model attached
[01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:38.920]   It kind of is the model for that and what I would hope is it could be used elsewhere
[01:10:38.920 --> 01:10:42.840]   Including even at facebook what is this thing that you said they would use
[01:10:43.800 --> 01:10:48.600]   Well you and I talked about that we were when we were at that session about what could google do that google guys
[01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:51.160]   There was talking about basically embeddable content
[01:10:51.160 --> 01:10:58.200]   Plus you just invented google plus my god you're a genius
[01:10:58.200 --> 01:11:03.560]   But yes, yes, so that you're a nice guy
[01:11:03.560 --> 01:11:09.400]   I just want to say google plus eight for a while. It's really trouble because uh
[01:11:09.960 --> 01:11:16.280]   Video just doesn't express sarcasm. Well, no, no, it's not your fault. Oh american doesn't express sarcasm
[01:11:16.280 --> 01:11:25.560]   Um, you know it's interesting when when I go to zoeykeating's facebook page and it's and her about it says her web page is twitter.com
[01:11:25.560 --> 01:11:28.280]   slash zoeykeating
[01:11:28.280 --> 01:11:30.280]   So or is i mean zoey cello so
[01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:37.000]   Maybe maybe this is a blessing that we all should learn you need a website. Is that really old school old-fashioned?
[01:11:37.080 --> 01:11:43.160]   No, no, no for for goodness sakes everyone should have a website with your own domain name
[01:11:43.160 --> 01:11:47.160]   It's like do you want to have your own own number that you control? I it's
[01:11:47.160 --> 01:11:52.680]   Actually, she does her her blog posts are all on zoeykeating.com so I take
[01:11:52.680 --> 01:11:58.600]   She doesn't list it but you know, it's tumblr is tumblr like having your own website
[01:11:58.600 --> 01:12:02.280]   Not if it says tumblr.com. It does your own name
[01:12:02.520 --> 01:12:08.920]   So see so then like here's what happens in like five years tumblr crashes somebody buys it
[01:12:08.920 --> 01:12:12.120]   It goes all geo city and your your your home is gone
[01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:19.160]   You need to have it on tumblr you could be zoeykeating.com and you should be right because then you could redirect
[01:12:19.160 --> 01:12:21.640]   You could redirect wherever you want to go. Yeah
[01:12:21.640 --> 01:12:23.960]   I think that's also
[01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:28.280]   And I think that's also a lesson you're finding a lot of people start to realize where they thought
[01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:31.800]   As facebook picked up they're like I just have facebook page now
[01:12:31.800 --> 01:12:36.600]   And i'm just putting everything to facebook and then like suddenly they're like where's all my traffic from facebook gone and
[01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:40.840]   It's like well, you know, you built your house. You didn't build your own house
[01:12:40.840 --> 01:12:45.560]   You you rented or leased somebody else's house. Right so I think it took it away
[01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:48.600]   and set up your friend
[01:12:48.600 --> 01:12:56.440]   I agree with you danny, but there's another argument if you look at what Andy carving has done under the omidy are some impressive
[01:12:58.120 --> 01:13:03.080]   Reportedly he doesn't really he's he's on twitter. He's on facebook. They're on twitter. They're on facebook
[01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:07.320]   They're on medium and the closest thing they have I think to a home page is on medium
[01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:11.720]   And you know what people on medium are going to discover the same damn thing
[01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:15.720]   They're going to go off on medium because it's all hot is all the new tumblr or whatever
[01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:20.600]   And down the line they may be like, oh, I actually want to move to the next hot thing
[01:13:20.600 --> 01:13:22.680]   Let me ask this if you have a zoeyke
[01:13:22.680 --> 01:13:24.280]   You kids what happened to us?
[01:13:24.280 --> 01:13:28.280]   But let me ask this if you have as zoey has zoey cello at zoey cello
[01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:34.200]   1 million followers are on twitter. Don't you always have a channel for saying? Oh, I'm no longer on tumblr come to this site
[01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:39.160]   I mean you you do but you've got people out on tumblr who then have to find you and by the way
[01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:44.040]   All those links that people started pointing to your thing go away, you know google kind of cares about the well
[01:13:44.040 --> 01:13:45.480]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[01:13:45.480 --> 01:13:50.200]   It's it's not hard to have your own home in most places and it can live on tumblr
[01:13:50.200 --> 01:13:53.880]   And you can you could still be on tumblr you can still say I want to have my tumblr
[01:13:53.880 --> 01:13:58.680]   And I'm going to post over there and point you to my main thing or or however you want to do it
[01:13:58.680 --> 01:14:03.000]   Although, you know, I get that it can be a headache for some people at first
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:09.160]   But I think it is a short-term headache that saves you from a long-term one apparently she does have zoeykeating.com
[01:14:09.160 --> 01:14:14.440]   So we're not we're not singling you out zoey, but you know, and you know, that's that's the other thing too
[01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:18.280]   It's like it's really easy to sit back and like say someone should do this someone do that
[01:14:18.600 --> 01:14:21.000]   I am really a big believer in that you actually
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:25.480]   Want to know why people are doing certain things some people want to be
[01:14:25.480 --> 01:14:28.920]   Out on like I think you know search and shine we have a tumblr
[01:14:28.920 --> 01:14:33.080]   Because there's people out there and we're not worried that if that tumblr goes away
[01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:39.880]   You know what will we do but it's not our main house, right? It's like hey, there's a tumblr neighborhood going up
[01:14:39.880 --> 01:14:41.880]   Well, we're moving in as well
[01:14:41.880 --> 01:14:46.120]   And by the way, if the party gets big come on over to our house. We've got more room. So
[01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:51.960]   uh, here's one uh, the cops don't like ways they say
[01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:57.000]   This could be dangerous that ways tells you there's a police officer on the road
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:02.680]   Big bad google again. They call it a stalking feature and
[01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:05.720]   Uh, which is ridiculous
[01:15:05.720 --> 01:15:08.840]   I doubt cop killers use ways, but
[01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:12.280]   Uh, maybe anyway, they're campaigning
[01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:15.160]   To pressure google to turn off
[01:15:15.720 --> 01:15:20.360]   Because google owns ways now the feature that warns drivers and police are nearby
[01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:23.400]   It could put lives in danger
[01:15:23.400 --> 01:15:31.720]   Basic lesson is you can't control information anymore guys. We'll find some way to know where you are that information gets there because other ways users
[01:15:31.720 --> 01:15:34.920]   Spotted a police officer. Usually the reason for it is
[01:15:34.920 --> 01:15:40.840]   Uh, because it's a speed trap or you know, they they just want to let you know you should drive more carefully because there
[01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:43.320]   Or it's also an indication that there's been an accident or something
[01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:50.520]   Those are cops there. Well you have a button for accident too. I mean, uh, you do. Yes, my experience is this is more like a hay slowdown
[01:15:50.520 --> 01:15:56.760]   But but but google's answer was the more people think there are cops all over the slower they're gonna drive
[01:15:56.760 --> 01:15:59.960]   That's actually better. Yeah, julie mossler
[01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:05.640]   Speaking for ways says ways does work with the new york police department and others around the world by sharing information
[01:16:05.640 --> 01:16:11.800]   These relationships keep citizens safe promote faster emergency response and help alleviate traffic
[01:16:12.520 --> 01:16:14.520]   congestion
[01:16:14.520 --> 01:16:20.280]   I mean, it's hard because you know whenever they do it to you. I checkpoint they're required by law to tell you they're gonna
[01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:26.360]   Really they have the announcer's a du i have to pre-announce where they're gonna be you have to know so
[01:16:26.360 --> 01:16:29.240]   Yeah, it seems why is that
[01:16:29.240 --> 01:16:33.400]   Because people have a telephone you have a right not to I guess
[01:16:33.400 --> 01:16:39.000]   You know getting to search area. I don't know. I don't know why it is and maybe it's just a california law
[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:45.640]   But they have to announce them in advance also when you come up to checkpoint you have to have the ability to turn away from that checkpoint
[01:16:45.640 --> 01:16:47.640]   You don't want to go through it really you're kidding
[01:16:47.640 --> 01:16:52.760]   Yeah, I think I did a story on I think I did a story on checkpoints once not my neck of the woods out here
[01:16:52.760 --> 01:16:57.640]   They block all the turns and then they're probably violating the law and if you actually got a ticket
[01:16:57.640 --> 01:17:01.240]   First of all, if you got a ticket, I'd probably hope that you did but sorry
[01:17:01.240 --> 01:17:03.480]   you know, but
[01:17:03.480 --> 01:17:07.720]   But no, you're supposed to be able to turn off and that's part of the way the law works
[01:17:08.040 --> 01:17:17.000]   But this is not the first time for us senators in 2011 asked apple to remove all applications that alert users to drunk driving checkpoints
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:23.240]   Which was no key remove the sobriety check tracking function in one of their apps
[01:17:23.240 --> 01:17:27.560]   Trapster was eventually discontinued at the end of the year
[01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:32.360]   But the founder says it was because ways did such a so much of a better job
[01:17:32.360 --> 01:17:35.640]   I understand police would be nervous about this
[01:17:36.280 --> 01:17:38.280]   You know, if you were gonna I mean
[01:17:38.280 --> 01:17:41.560]   You can totally understand it, especially what happened in New York, right?
[01:17:41.560 --> 01:17:46.200]   My first initial reaction when I saw that was like wow. Yeah, that is scary
[01:17:46.200 --> 01:17:52.280]   And then on if you think a bit more, it's like it is not difficult for you to figure out where police are without having to
[01:17:52.280 --> 01:17:55.320]   You know, if you're gonna go if you're gonna go out trying to find a police officer
[01:17:55.320 --> 01:17:58.200]   You probably don't need to rely on ways to figure out how to do it
[01:17:58.200 --> 01:18:02.760]   But it's yeah, it's the truth is people don't just have guys who are on patrol in there
[01:18:02.760 --> 01:18:07.720]   The truth is they're putting up speed traps, right? And and and god, I'll be again
[01:18:07.720 --> 01:18:10.920]   Google has a point that that you know, you end up you end up slowing down
[01:18:10.920 --> 01:18:16.760]   The cops don't get to zap as many people, but if people are actually going slower, it's better
[01:18:16.760 --> 01:18:22.200]   Well, when we get the auto driving cars, it won't matter because then i'll be speeding it all be good
[01:18:22.200 --> 01:18:26.200]   And they'll report on all your movements and then we'll have a privacy
[01:18:26.200 --> 01:18:29.720]   Crisis and that'll be the world. I believe that's grizzle
[01:18:31.560 --> 01:18:33.560]   What is grizzle? I don't know
[01:18:33.560 --> 01:18:36.360]   Parks and rec last night was so funny
[01:18:36.360 --> 01:18:42.120]   Grizzle is this big big google like company has moved in and there's like said in the future is like
[01:18:42.120 --> 01:18:43.640]   2014
[01:18:43.640 --> 01:18:45.640]   And they they're tight
[01:18:45.640 --> 01:18:51.880]   These drones appear and start delivering everybody gifts based on data mining all their searches and emails
[01:18:51.880 --> 01:18:56.120]   To try to get them to let them build something and it's like Taylor Swift
[01:18:56.120 --> 01:18:58.680]   Yeah, it's very very close to yeah
[01:19:00.360 --> 01:19:03.160]   No Taylor Swift should never do anything she would never do anything like that
[01:19:03.160 --> 01:19:06.280]   um
[01:19:06.280 --> 01:19:11.240]   There's so much here and I don't want to uh, belabor the point you guys have anything
[01:19:11.240 --> 01:19:18.680]   Oh, I thought this was interesting. We talked I think last week about the thought that google was anticipated to launch its own wireless company
[01:19:18.680 --> 01:19:21.160]   And mvno sometime
[01:19:21.160 --> 01:19:23.480]   this year
[01:19:23.480 --> 01:19:26.120]   Uh, maybe in the first half of the year would be based
[01:19:26.840 --> 01:19:30.920]   Uh on sprint and t-mobile and that's kind of the interesting
[01:19:30.920 --> 01:19:35.800]   New information, which is that google would decide
[01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:42.200]   Where you're getting the better signal from wifi t-mobile or sprint and then better prices
[01:19:42.200 --> 01:19:45.640]   Well, that would be even more interesting and then just choose it
[01:19:45.640 --> 01:19:49.960]   Automatically so you would be if you were using google's wireless carrier
[01:19:49.960 --> 01:19:54.120]   Uh, in effect the customer of all three or sprint and t-mobile plus wifi
[01:19:54.920 --> 01:19:59.640]   Uh google did not have a comment on this, but I think that's fascinating. I think it really is
[01:19:59.640 --> 01:20:07.080]   Uh, I would I would almost be attempted to say oh, they'll you know sprint and t-mobile would never allow that and yet sprint sells
[01:20:07.080 --> 01:20:10.840]   Us service wholesale services to mvno's
[01:20:10.840 --> 01:20:14.600]   Where they're allowing them to undercut sprints own pricing so I
[01:20:14.600 --> 01:20:18.600]   Mobile because our friends at uh as a tingle ting
[01:20:18.600 --> 01:20:22.600]   Ting thank you are gonna do I think are they gonna go?
[01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:26.440]   And don't they have now a um t-mobile as well?
[01:20:26.440 --> 01:20:29.960]   The gsm that must be that must be it. Yeah
[01:20:29.960 --> 01:20:32.120]   Isn't that interesting?
[01:20:32.120 --> 01:20:34.120]   two things they're gonna do um
[01:20:34.120 --> 01:20:39.160]   That and they're gonna do yes ting to offer gsm network good
[01:20:39.160 --> 01:20:42.120]   Well, I like this idea. I hope google does it
[01:20:42.120 --> 01:20:45.800]   Because that'd be great, right? You just get whatever the yeah
[01:20:45.800 --> 01:20:51.080]   Because that's my concern about sprint in general's here sprints fine in some places. It's not great around here
[01:20:51.480 --> 01:20:56.040]   You nice if it could switch off. Yeah, but could that would be who wouldn't want that?
[01:20:56.040 --> 01:20:58.280]   But if you go to india
[01:20:58.280 --> 01:21:01.000]   Every phone you buy there has to sim for that reason. Yeah
[01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:04.280]   Not here
[01:21:04.280 --> 01:21:09.960]   The other story there that I think is really really important on as since I have a grandfather unlimited atnt plan
[01:21:09.960 --> 01:21:15.480]   The ftc just said that unlimited means unlimited. It's enforcing that the dam dictionary
[01:21:15.480 --> 01:21:19.160]   It says unlimited with throttling does not count
[01:21:19.880 --> 01:21:25.800]   Now unless you unless you get into the article unless you know you made it clearer
[01:21:25.800 --> 01:21:34.680]   I tell you i've gone into stores and said wait a minute. Does that mean it's unlimited unlimited? I can get as much as I want
[01:21:34.680 --> 01:21:36.920]   Yeah, will you slow me down at any point? No
[01:21:36.920 --> 01:21:39.880]   totally fine
[01:21:39.880 --> 01:21:47.480]   AT&T and Verizon both have stopped offering unlimited data plans to new customers, but unfortunately they can't get jeff javas to leave
[01:21:48.440 --> 01:21:54.120]   There are a lot of people holding on through all sorts of loopholes to their unlimited service
[01:21:54.120 --> 01:21:58.680]   Uh, this came actually out of a case with track phone
[01:21:58.680 --> 01:22:04.600]   Uh, and in fact if you were a track phone customer who purchased an unlimited plan
[01:22:04.600 --> 01:22:09.160]   And was slowed down you could you may be eligible for refunds
[01:22:09.160 --> 01:22:18.120]   According to the ftc the track phone generally slowed data service when a customer used one to three gigabytes and suspended data service at four to five gigabytes
[01:22:18.760 --> 01:22:25.240]   The case is about and it is the ftc. Let's face it. The case is about false advertising
[01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:28.760]   It's not about throttling. We're not challenging throttling in and of itself
[01:22:28.760 --> 01:22:33.000]   But they they should just do it because I don't I don't know how the fcc
[01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000]   I don't know how they can go through and say oh
[01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:41.880]   Unlimited is not unlimited if you throttle unless you make it clear to people that you will limit
[01:22:41.880 --> 01:22:44.680]   They're limited thing and then it's okay to still call it
[01:22:44.680 --> 01:22:51.800]   Unlimited just means we're not going to limit the number of gigabytes you get no no no unlimited means you don't limit
[01:22:51.800 --> 01:23:01.960]   By definition unlimited means you do not have limits. It's like saying, you know, uninflated means
[01:23:01.960 --> 01:23:05.400]   But only partially
[01:23:05.400 --> 01:23:07.480]   I like it
[01:23:07.480 --> 01:23:10.200]   Okay, if it's you know, I just
[01:23:11.560 --> 01:23:15.720]   And that's by the way what drives me nuts about t mobile the most I think they do these great
[01:23:15.720 --> 01:23:17.480]   great
[01:23:17.480 --> 01:23:24.040]   Advances to get people going off and did you know and then raise the whole industry and then you can do all this like fine printing
[01:23:24.040 --> 01:23:26.680]   Like oh no, this is limited here. No, oh, that's limited there
[01:23:26.680 --> 01:23:29.160]   You know, uh, so she's just just
[01:23:29.160 --> 01:23:36.040]   Just give me some limited ftc should ban fine print let them use their five gigabytes and when they're done with using their five gigabytes
[01:23:36.040 --> 01:23:38.120]   then cut them off
[01:23:40.120 --> 01:23:42.120]   totally
[01:23:42.120 --> 01:23:44.120]   Moved
[01:23:44.120 --> 01:23:46.600]   My my colleagues
[01:23:46.600 --> 01:23:50.200]   Both of your arguments for you if you if you go to the to android
[01:23:50.200 --> 01:23:57.640]   Then I just saw this on google plus because I actually still use google plus and I find fascinating things there and interesting people
[01:23:57.640 --> 01:24:00.760]   But that's your choice
[01:24:00.760 --> 01:24:04.840]   Every day I'm there every day
[01:24:06.200 --> 01:24:10.280]   If on your android phone you type in angeli nicholi movie which I have done
[01:24:10.280 --> 01:24:14.360]   Get this pretty little grid I get most popular first
[01:24:14.360 --> 01:24:19.560]   Oh, maybe you don't have the latest version newest. This is the grid newest first all this first and then I get a list of
[01:24:19.560 --> 01:24:24.280]   No, look at mine. Look at mine. What's yours? What's yours? Look? Oh, I don't got that
[01:24:24.280 --> 01:24:28.600]   Now this is interesting. So if I go to google plus or where
[01:24:28.600 --> 01:24:31.880]   Uh just google but I'm gonna make your argument for you
[01:24:32.440 --> 01:24:38.600]   So then I go pick on mr. mrs. Smith. Okay, and I scroll wonder where I can get mr. mrs
[01:24:38.600 --> 01:24:39.720]   Smith
[01:24:39.720 --> 01:24:42.840]   What it tells me is available on google play on youtube
[01:24:42.840 --> 01:24:49.880]   Uh-huh, there's your point. Uh, now mind you I can't use uh, ijunes on this so
[01:24:49.880 --> 01:24:54.680]   You know wouldn't do any good. I'm using chrome on my s. I imagine. Where were you clicking again?
[01:24:54.680 --> 01:24:57.320]   I want to see this again. So you clicked on mr. mrs. Smith
[01:24:57.320 --> 01:25:00.440]   You did this pretty grid. Do you hear the
[01:25:01.800 --> 01:25:06.280]   This this this thing. Okay, you're using the next six. So yeah
[01:25:06.280 --> 01:25:08.680]   And then it was like a playlist smith
[01:25:08.680 --> 01:25:11.640]   I'm gonna turn mr. Smith great movie great movie
[01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:16.520]   And you really it was all still pretty and you scroll all right, but it really you want to stand by that?
[01:25:16.520 --> 01:25:20.280]   It was okay. Yeah, it's growing up. What am I seeing this different?
[01:25:20.280 --> 01:25:22.760]   Well, yeah
[01:25:22.760 --> 01:25:26.680]   It's also available on also available. So I have to try this
[01:25:26.680 --> 01:25:30.600]   It's also available on but but you know what it is Jeff by the way
[01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:34.760]   Yeah, um, I probably have the voodoo app installed on my phone
[01:25:34.760 --> 01:25:41.240]   Or it's it's a link over there and technically and i'm betting you google would tell you that
[01:25:41.240 --> 01:25:45.800]   If you had amazon instant video installed on your phone then that might turn into a link
[01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:48.520]   But
[01:25:48.520 --> 01:25:54.040]   You know it is interesting that they still have their own stuff. Yeah, but i'm gonna use absent anything better
[01:25:54.040 --> 01:25:57.880]   Oh, I tried to click on voodoo when it tells me that chrome beta has stopped
[01:25:57.880 --> 01:26:00.120]   Ha ha conspiracy
[01:26:00.920 --> 01:26:01.320]   Mmm
[01:26:01.320 --> 01:26:07.640]   YouTube now streams hml5 video by default that's good news for a while you had to choose hml5 as a
[01:26:07.640 --> 01:26:11.080]   Choice, but that's I guess no more flash
[01:26:11.080 --> 01:26:14.520]   Thank you. Thank you youtube
[01:26:14.520 --> 01:26:17.560]   I could pat them on the back for that
[01:26:17.560 --> 01:26:24.280]   Uh and google fiber will come next to it land as charlotte nashville and rolly durham. I'm so jealous
[01:26:24.280 --> 01:26:27.000]   I know so jealous still not on that list
[01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000]   Uh
[01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:35.240]   NBC discontinuing the video podcast do we care?
[01:26:35.240 --> 01:26:42.200]   No, they're evidently all the networks are yeah, nobody watched enough the old networks are stopping them. Yeah
[01:26:42.200 --> 01:26:45.080]   wonder why not
[01:26:45.080 --> 01:26:52.920]   Skymall this idea of podcasting have a larger share of ear. Well, there's also a share of i
[01:26:53.880 --> 01:26:59.160]   Uh while while audio is still bigger than video for most of our shows. It's not the case for all of our shows
[01:26:59.160 --> 01:27:03.480]   I pad the day for instance, which is very visual has more video subscribers
[01:27:03.480 --> 01:27:06.440]   Wasn't proportion for twit and twig roughly
[01:27:06.440 --> 01:27:09.000]   I think it's probably 60 40s
[01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:12.840]   Audio to video, but I don't know it's you know it's always around
[01:27:12.840 --> 01:27:15.720]   70 30 60 40 something like that
[01:27:15.720 --> 01:27:20.840]   But that number is way up and we we only started doing video five or six years ago and it's been growing
[01:27:21.960 --> 01:27:23.960]   How about this
[01:27:23.960 --> 01:27:27.160]   Man, Matthew inman has power. He has social power
[01:27:27.160 --> 01:27:31.000]   he elon lee and shane small
[01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:40.760]   Decided to do a kickstarter for a kitty powered version of russian roulette a card game called exploding kittens
[01:27:40.760 --> 01:27:48.200]   Players take turns drying cards until someone draws an exploding kitten and loses the game. You know what? This is uno
[01:27:49.160 --> 01:27:52.360]   With exploding kittens. It's exactly the same game. I think
[01:27:52.360 --> 01:28:00.360]   So, uh, they thought you know if we could raise maybe I don't know $10,000 on kickstarter. We could go ahead within
[01:28:00.360 --> 01:28:03.320]   within
[01:28:03.320 --> 01:28:10.840]   20 minutes they got 10 that within an hour they got a fed they are now up to 4.4 million dollars for a card game
[01:28:10.840 --> 01:28:14.440]   Jesus with 22 days to go
[01:28:14.440 --> 01:28:17.320]   What is it caused to buy a card game?
[01:28:18.600 --> 01:28:22.280]   It's like 20 bucks. I think it's the entry well they got 20 bucks for the basic deck
[01:28:22.280 --> 01:28:27.080]   But of course a lot of backers for the 35 dollar nsfw deck
[01:28:27.080 --> 01:28:29.320]   Yep
[01:28:29.320 --> 01:28:31.160]   with horrible
[01:28:31.160 --> 01:28:36.120]   Images too horrible to include in the kid-friendly version. That's the big that's the big one
[01:28:36.120 --> 01:28:39.720]   That's 104,000 folks 200 backers pledged 100 or more
[01:28:39.720 --> 01:28:42.840]   Five backers pledged 500 dollars
[01:28:42.840 --> 01:28:46.040]   Plus you get a custom card
[01:28:47.320 --> 01:28:52.920]   Drawn just for you just for you. What the hell I am in the wrong business
[01:28:52.920 --> 01:28:59.640]   Are you especially when it's a card deck a card deck? I mean I realize there's like what?
[01:28:59.640 --> 01:29:03.880]   Exactly. It's just you're a profit printing that stuff profit
[01:29:03.880 --> 01:29:08.280]   This is like we might do print money. Would you like to buy in?
[01:29:08.280 --> 01:29:11.880]   For every five dollars you give me. I'll give you a dollar bill
[01:29:11.880 --> 01:29:14.520]   Now how much would you pay?
[01:29:14.520 --> 01:29:18.120]   That's what you should do. You should do a card game that's made out of five dollars
[01:29:18.120 --> 01:29:21.080]   And then sell it for 20 for 20. Yeah
[01:29:21.080 --> 01:29:27.400]   Unbelievable your card game would be like a five dollar bill all cut up and then it's like who can put it off
[01:29:27.400 --> 01:29:29.640]   I'm thinking about stuff
[01:29:29.640 --> 01:29:34.280]   I just this is the equivalent of uh, what's apps selling for a billion or whatever?
[01:29:34.280 --> 01:29:37.000]   It was this is like holy cow
[01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:40.840]   I mean they've actually you're getting a product. So, you know, hey, it's great
[01:29:41.320 --> 01:29:46.200]   Actually, you know what it's you're not getting a product. There's no guarantee you're gonna get a product
[01:29:46.200 --> 01:29:49.240]   Yeah, they are you're gonna. Well, I'm sure they will
[01:29:49.240 --> 01:29:51.640]   I'm sure they will
[01:29:51.640 --> 01:29:54.120]   But as you know with kickstarter, there's no promise
[01:29:54.120 --> 01:29:59.880]   Oh, oatmeal's not gonna not give you cars. He's not gonna. I know what I know and of course he will
[01:29:59.880 --> 01:30:05.800]   And so and besides the fact that you know, you paid 35 for 50 cent deck of cards
[01:30:06.680 --> 01:30:13.160]   He's there's no reason not for him not to oh, you pay that for other kind of it's not it's not the materials
[01:30:13.160 --> 01:30:16.840]   It's like the art and that you've got the game and you know, it's
[01:30:16.840 --> 01:30:20.360]   $4 million with art
[01:30:20.360 --> 01:30:25.800]   When it's like when I bought my monopoly board for $15 that that actually cost me $15
[01:30:25.800 --> 01:30:28.600]   I think people are really tapping into the
[01:30:28.600 --> 01:30:31.240]   kitten hatred movement
[01:30:31.240 --> 01:30:36.600]   And we really ought to investigate that oatmeal is a phenomenon oatmeal's amazing matthew is amazing
[01:30:37.400 --> 01:30:39.720]   Go daddy, which has the puppy-hating movement
[01:30:39.720 --> 01:30:46.280]   Really? What's good? Is this there a super bowl commercial two puppies to raise? There's that plus uber uber tomorrow for 30
[01:30:46.280 --> 01:30:48.840]   All of me
[01:30:48.840 --> 01:30:53.480]   Now co-hots, sorry, it's great ad. Okay, so the the go daddy ad
[01:30:53.480 --> 01:30:57.160]   This is going to be their super bowl ad at least it's not
[01:30:57.160 --> 01:31:00.200]   It's not it's not some sexy thing
[01:31:00.200 --> 01:31:03.960]   I mean they got away from the the sexist stuff
[01:31:03.960 --> 01:31:08.920]   You gotta you gotta you gotta go find the buzzwise. They're just super bowl ad that's out now and play it
[01:31:08.920 --> 01:31:14.200]   And then we'll all be very touched and then go find the go daddy puppy
[01:31:14.200 --> 01:31:20.280]   Which is funny unless you know, you don't agree with I think it's you know
[01:31:20.280 --> 01:31:28.360]   So last year so remember to go daddy ran those very sexist ads the kind of where you have the the the geek being kissed by the super model
[01:31:28.360 --> 01:31:33.480]   And then you know girls and then more porn star, but yeah, yeah
[01:31:33.720 --> 01:31:40.600]   You know and then and then last year they got new ceo bob parston said goodbye took his elephant and got and went
[01:31:40.600 --> 01:31:42.600]   wrote off into the
[01:31:42.600 --> 01:31:45.160]   Sunset and then the new guys
[01:31:45.160 --> 01:31:50.840]   Last year there were women in their ads, but they were all web entrepreneurs
[01:31:50.840 --> 01:31:56.920]   Apparently that didn't really make it so they're back to controversy, but not sexism. Let's watch the go daddy
[01:31:56.920 --> 01:31:59.640]   Super bowl ad a dog
[01:31:59.640 --> 01:32:02.760]   Being dropped off
[01:32:03.400 --> 01:32:05.400]   Running
[01:32:05.400 --> 01:32:12.040]   Just by the road sad it's raining and it's cold and wait here's a barn
[01:32:12.040 --> 01:32:18.840]   Found his way back because I just sold you on this website. I've built with go daddy
[01:32:18.840 --> 01:32:22.920]   Oh god
[01:32:22.920 --> 01:32:29.240]   Oh god, well, I guess they said hey controversy we don't have to be sexist we could just
[01:32:30.200 --> 01:32:34.840]   Oh, why is there one now? Come on. You want to get the bad taste out of your mouth? Yes
[01:32:34.840 --> 01:32:40.840]   You want the Budweiser one instead? Yes, this is that this is kind of this is I think what they're making fun of
[01:32:40.840 --> 01:32:49.080]   Right women. No, that's just weird that the Budweiser ad actually came out today. I think and theirs came out. Yes. They must have known right? Yeah, maybe
[01:32:49.080 --> 01:32:52.440]   Maybe they knew something here's the Budweiser ad this will make you feel better
[01:32:52.440 --> 01:32:55.480]   This is the inspiration
[01:32:55.480 --> 01:32:58.440]   Little doggy running out of a barn
[01:32:59.240 --> 01:33:05.240]   Wasn't this last year? No, no, this is a horse carrier, you know, but the horse carrier
[01:33:05.240 --> 01:33:10.040]   That guy should not be allowed to have animals. No, he's very bad. Thank you declared, right?
[01:33:10.040 --> 01:33:14.520]   It's very bad. He forgave the dog is lost because he oh no, it's raining
[01:33:14.520 --> 01:33:19.800]   There's the Clydesdale. He's sad because he lost his dog, but at least he's got his horse
[01:33:19.800 --> 01:33:24.920]   Wait a minute. The dog has come back to the barn the Clydesdale spots the dog the dog looks back
[01:33:24.920 --> 01:33:28.680]   There's a wolf. Oh my god. The dog barking at the wolf
[01:33:28.680 --> 01:33:34.040]   He's he's facing off the horses are coming here come the Clydesdale's to rescue the dog
[01:33:34.040 --> 01:33:37.880]   The wolf runs away the horses are welcome back
[01:33:37.880 --> 01:33:42.920]   Meanwhile the doofus who lost the dog in the first place is standing at the window with a cup of coffee
[01:33:42.920 --> 01:33:45.240]   Sees his dog running back
[01:33:45.240 --> 01:33:49.800]   And then goes to go daddy to start our website to sell his dog. It's all the dogs
[01:33:54.360 --> 01:33:56.520]   It's gonna be a hell of a game sunday
[01:33:56.520 --> 01:34:01.160]   Just a little program note by the way, we are starting to it an hour early
[01:34:01.160 --> 01:34:03.720]   So I won't miss a single commercial on the super bowl this

[01:36:00.040 --> 01:36:05.080]   I'm trying to think what my tool should be I got a couple of things this is
[01:36:05.080 --> 01:36:07.160]   uh
[01:36:07.160 --> 01:36:10.600]   I think kind of neat. It's a journaling app that has called journey
[01:36:11.320 --> 01:36:15.640]   That has a corresponding I don't let me just real quickly pull it up in my chrome
[01:36:15.640 --> 01:36:21.080]   Make sure I don't have any revealing journal entries. It's an android
[01:36:21.080 --> 01:36:24.920]   Uh, it's an android device
[01:36:24.920 --> 01:36:29.800]   Uh android app. It is a uh, a chrome extension
[01:36:29.800 --> 01:36:32.600]   And I really like it's called journey
[01:36:32.600 --> 01:36:36.600]   It has a few features if you've been looking to journal and this is this is nice
[01:36:36.600 --> 01:36:39.960]   You can you can keep it secure. You can add images to it
[01:36:40.440 --> 01:36:43.880]   It will automatically put the weather forecast in your journal entries
[01:36:43.880 --> 01:36:47.560]   And your location in your journal entries, which is kind of cool
[01:36:47.560 --> 01:36:51.080]   Um, and uh, and it's it's free. It's called
[01:36:51.080 --> 01:36:53.720]   Journey. They also have uh
[01:36:53.720 --> 01:36:56.680]   Inspirations page, which if you're looking for things
[01:36:56.680 --> 01:36:59.800]   To kind of inspire. Yeah, that's it. Okay
[01:36:59.800 --> 01:37:04.200]   Uh, and this just came out last week. I really like it inspire you
[01:37:05.720 --> 01:37:10.680]   To write you can pick an inspiration and then make it be the beginning of that entry
[01:37:10.680 --> 01:37:12.440]   So for instance, bruce lee
[01:37:12.440 --> 01:37:15.080]   Do not pray for an easy life
[01:37:15.080 --> 01:37:19.800]   Pray for the strength to endure a difficult one if I like that I tap the light bulb
[01:37:19.800 --> 01:37:24.360]   It now becomes the beginning of a new journal entry. There's lots of them. There's new ones all the time
[01:37:24.360 --> 01:37:28.520]   Uh, I'm I actually am kind of fond of this. I've been using it a lot
[01:37:28.520 --> 01:37:33.320]   Uh journey it'll bring journal writing back into your life and
[01:37:34.360 --> 01:37:39.880]   Uh, I really like it. It can even become a photo journal and a journal of your travels
[01:37:39.880 --> 01:37:44.760]   And it is what is the uh, URL there is it get journey?
[01:37:44.760 --> 01:37:47.560]   It was
[01:37:47.560 --> 01:37:52.760]   To the number two app studio.com slash journey to app studio.com. All right. Yep
[01:37:52.760 --> 01:37:56.520]   Jeff you got a number for us. There's a lot of them this week
[01:37:57.400 --> 01:38:04.920]   Fastening column in the d- in the New York Times seth, uh, steven's divinovates was looking at online behavior and sex
[01:38:04.920 --> 01:38:13.400]   So I found lots and lots of numbers here a few of them he analyzed general social survey a classic source just to get a start off here
[01:38:13.400 --> 01:38:19.640]   And found that heterosexual men said they performed 63 sex acts per year
[01:38:19.640 --> 01:38:26.840]   Using condoms 23 percent of the time that adds up to 1.6 billion heterosexual condom uses per year
[01:38:27.480 --> 01:38:34.600]   There are sexual women say they average 55 sex acts per year using a condom 16 of the time that has as up to about 1.1
[01:38:34.600 --> 01:38:37.880]   Billion heterosexual condom uses per year
[01:38:37.880 --> 01:38:42.440]   1.6 versus 1.1. Well, who's telling the truth men or women?
[01:38:42.440 --> 01:38:43.960]   Right
[01:38:43.960 --> 01:38:51.160]   According to Nielsen fewer than 600 million condoms are sold every year roughly twice the number of actual sales
[01:38:51.160 --> 01:38:54.840]   Yes, wow, so that goes on and it goes down to look at
[01:38:55.160 --> 01:38:59.080]   Google's uh, what Google can reveal about american attitudes towards sex
[01:38:59.080 --> 01:39:03.400]   And he said on google the top complaint about marriage is not having sex
[01:39:03.400 --> 01:39:10.680]   Yes searches for a sexless marriage are three and a half times more common than unhappy marriage eight times more common than loveless marriage
[01:39:10.680 --> 01:39:17.640]   Wow, there are 16 times more complaints about a spouse not wanting sex than about a married partner not being willing to talk
[01:39:17.640 --> 01:39:21.000]   um
[01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:25.160]   Google searches for sexless relationship or second only to searches for abusive relationship
[01:39:25.160 --> 01:39:27.560]   I don't I say they go together
[01:39:27.560 --> 01:39:29.720]   Yeah, I'd say so on google
[01:39:29.720 --> 01:39:36.200]   There are five and a half times more complaints about an unmarried partner not wanting sex than an unmarried partner refusing to text back
[01:39:36.200 --> 01:39:42.040]   There are more complaints about a boyfriend won't have sex than a girlfriend won't complain
[01:39:42.040 --> 01:39:44.360]   My husband's and lives are roughly equal
[01:39:44.360 --> 01:39:46.600]   um
[01:39:46.600 --> 01:39:53.640]   Taken together the data suggests that americans managed to have sex about 30 times per year or once every 12 days
[01:39:53.640 --> 01:39:57.560]   Now, um
[01:39:57.560 --> 01:40:02.440]   Google searches suggest one predominant reason enormous anxiety much of it misplaced
[01:40:02.440 --> 01:40:05.240]   Start with guess what men's neuroses?
[01:40:05.240 --> 01:40:10.760]   It isn't news that men worry about their genitals, but the degree of this worry is rather profound
[01:40:11.160 --> 01:40:17.080]   From a google search alone. We cannot know the gender of the user. However, we can often make a pretty good guess
[01:40:17.080 --> 01:40:22.600]   He says I'm reading here for searches about sex and body parts like my penis blank
[01:40:22.600 --> 01:40:29.480]   Ben google more questions about their sexual organ than any other body part more than their lungs liver feet ears. Whoa
[01:40:29.480 --> 01:40:32.520]   find
[01:40:32.520 --> 01:40:34.600]   um
[01:40:34.600 --> 01:40:39.800]   Side note one of the more common questions for google about a penis is quote. How big is my penis
[01:40:40.360 --> 01:40:48.440]   That's good google that a ruler with this question is in my opinion a quintessential expression of our digital era
[01:40:48.440 --> 01:40:53.240]   Why I don't why would you google that? I don't know. I don't know
[01:40:53.240 --> 01:40:58.040]   Um and the irony is if you keep going
[01:40:58.040 --> 01:41:05.400]   Yep, that uh more than 40 percent of complaints about a partner's penis is that it's too big
[01:41:07.720 --> 01:41:10.920]   Pain is the most google bird used in searches with the phrase
[01:41:10.920 --> 01:41:15.480]   blank during sex. They don't have to read the rest of these
[01:41:15.480 --> 01:41:19.000]   Why
[01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:23.080]   Why are you people searching for this dove?
[01:41:23.080 --> 01:41:28.760]   This is what google rot however only 1% of searches
[01:41:28.760 --> 01:41:31.320]   That's a story daddy you have every search of this story there is
[01:41:31.320 --> 01:41:37.640]   That story. I'm just I'm just shocked. I am shocked very fast
[01:41:37.640 --> 01:41:41.720]   I'm just a few people search for how to make your penis smaller interestingly only 1% of all searches
[01:41:41.720 --> 01:41:49.880]   Well, that's that's that's there we are searching for sex. I'm gonna have to read all this
[01:41:49.880 --> 01:41:54.360]   This is in the sunday review of books oddly enough at the New York Times
[01:41:54.360 --> 01:42:03.720]   Seth Stevens divot of its writing it's a really cool column. It's really fun. It's interesting and he got and you know what what's cool about it
[01:42:03.720 --> 01:42:06.360]   He got it all by just you know looking up stuff on google
[01:42:07.320 --> 01:42:09.320]   Yeah, where do you get this information?
[01:42:09.320 --> 01:42:11.880]   Are we getting the data about men versus women? Yeah
[01:42:11.880 --> 01:42:15.080]   um, he he mentioned that
[01:42:15.080 --> 01:42:17.480]   He just says analysis of google data
[01:42:17.480 --> 01:42:23.720]   Yeah, he has that in there of why why you can't tell us if he's members women, but he makes the person say my penis
[01:42:23.720 --> 01:42:27.480]   Yes, that's why that was a that's a man
[01:42:27.480 --> 01:42:33.640]   Um, so but where is he getting all this is all says analysis of google data does google publish all this stuff
[01:42:34.840 --> 01:42:39.480]   Uh by by proportion. Yeah, so where would I go to look this stuff up?
[01:42:39.480 --> 01:42:43.640]   I mean right there. Danny. Isn't that isn't it Danny? Would you know?
[01:42:43.640 --> 01:42:48.680]   I'm you also know
[01:42:48.680 --> 01:42:57.400]   Man versus women, but just the general google stuff
[01:42:57.400 --> 01:43:02.440]   But even though he's saying stuff like men's top google concerned about steroids whether it might make their penis smaller
[01:43:03.080 --> 01:43:07.880]   Um, just because they use the word my I said, but I don't know where he's where would he get that?
[01:43:07.880 --> 01:43:13.240]   Because it's like okay. You have to get a list of all the searches related to penises
[01:43:13.240 --> 01:43:15.640]   Then you have to get it right by number
[01:43:15.640 --> 01:43:20.600]   Anyway, how do you get all the search just you know for academic?
[01:43:20.600 --> 01:43:25.080]   Interest google might have provided or you can use things like google trends or there's all right
[01:43:25.080 --> 01:43:27.160]   He may have he may have actually queried google
[01:43:27.160 --> 01:43:29.960]   I'd have liked to listen to that phone call
[01:43:30.360 --> 01:43:32.360]   Let's see when he says like
[01:43:32.360 --> 01:43:35.880]   My penis involved size average monthly searches for the phrasing so
[01:43:35.880 --> 01:43:45.080]   You could do that if you go into the google keyword tool and you're doing a search for penis
[01:43:45.080 --> 01:43:49.640]   And then you're breaking it down by a saying and then I suppose you can break it down with it from there by
[01:43:49.640 --> 01:43:53.000]   Demographics and now i'm going to have to go look. Thanks very much
[01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:59.320]   Ah, but i'm not going to do that. I will not let's have Danny let's have Danny do his thing
[01:43:59.320 --> 01:44:01.320]   And then we'll wrap this sucker up
[01:44:01.320 --> 01:44:07.400]   Uh, you know what beat that daddy beat that soul that he has been I can tell go ahead
[01:44:07.400 --> 01:44:12.040]   You know my thing was going to be semi self-promotional. I suppose go ahead
[01:44:12.040 --> 01:44:14.440]   The super bowl is coming up. Yes, it is
[01:44:14.440 --> 01:44:18.040]   Every every year we run a thing on marketing land called the hashtag bowl
[01:44:18.040 --> 01:44:19.960]   We'll be doing it again on sunday
[01:44:19.960 --> 01:44:22.440]   Where we look at all the ads that run on the super bowl
[01:44:22.440 --> 01:44:27.560]   And we count up how many of them have a hashtag or which social media networks are mentioned the most
[01:44:27.800 --> 01:44:31.480]   And at the end of it, we declare a winner last year facebook beat
[01:44:31.480 --> 01:44:34.360]   twitter by just like one one mention
[01:44:34.360 --> 01:44:38.920]   Sometimes people yeah, it was very very close the year before that
[01:44:38.920 --> 01:44:41.480]   um twitter had one
[01:44:41.480 --> 01:44:47.560]   And we also just kind of look at how often people are putting hashtags then we will do follow up coverage like how effective was putting
[01:44:47.560 --> 01:44:53.080]   All this social media into the ads like if you did search for these hashtags, what did you get or where that you went?
[01:44:53.160 --> 01:44:58.360]   So it'll be interesting to see we know when we get some breakouts like we'll as we have more snapchat in there
[01:44:58.360 --> 01:45:03.960]   What other kinds of things will come along or you know, maybe google plus we'll show a big surprise and people will show more with it
[01:45:03.960 --> 01:45:07.240]   And more integration with that. Yeah, right? It has
[01:45:07.240 --> 01:45:10.520]   Don't let up
[01:45:10.520 --> 01:45:13.880]   No, you can see now first of all you can see it's in our scoreboard
[01:45:13.880 --> 01:45:18.600]   So we care about it enough that we actually consider counting it and it's third on list so
[01:45:18.600 --> 01:45:22.120]   It's a distant third
[01:45:22.120 --> 01:45:24.760]   Yeah, but there's you know, we're we're looking at what's going with it
[01:45:24.760 --> 01:45:27.160]   But you know last year the numbers weren't weren't so big
[01:45:27.160 --> 01:45:30.280]   Um, how's how's elo doing elo? Oh?
[01:45:30.280 --> 01:45:32.360]   Oh, yeah
[01:45:32.360 --> 01:45:33.240]   No
[01:45:33.240 --> 01:45:35.800]   This I like this. This is fun the social media
[01:45:35.800 --> 01:45:37.160]   Yeah
[01:45:37.160 --> 01:45:38.200]   Scoreboard
[01:45:38.200 --> 01:45:42.200]   During the game where we look at all the ads and then as soon as it's over we'll declare the winner
[01:45:42.200 --> 01:45:47.960]   Of you know, which social network was mentioned the most is anybody do ads anymore without a hashtag?
[01:45:47.960 --> 01:45:49.400]   Yes, a lot of them do
[01:45:49.400 --> 01:45:53.320]   I think last year half of them either didn't have tags or didn't have
[01:45:53.320 --> 01:45:57.480]   They did either didn't have hashtags or they didn't have
[01:45:57.480 --> 01:46:03.800]   Social media mentions and it's very common too that they do these things and then they don't pay attention to search
[01:46:03.800 --> 01:46:10.520]   So they put the ads up then you can go search and they've done a terrible job about helping you, you know
[01:46:10.520 --> 01:46:15.480]   Find what the the official ad was or what the official information was and all that sort of stuff
[01:46:15.880 --> 01:46:19.960]   So it's kind of fun to look at it. We're also going to give out an award this year where we talk about
[01:46:19.960 --> 01:46:22.360]   who
[01:46:22.360 --> 01:46:25.080]   Which official campaign which official advertiser?
[01:46:25.080 --> 01:46:31.080]   We think did the best job during the super bowl with their ads and and social media tie-ins and who was the sort of best?
[01:46:31.080 --> 01:46:34.120]   unofficial newsjacker coming you with it from there
[01:46:34.120 --> 01:46:38.120]   And of course facebook will have once again, it's super bowl hub
[01:46:38.120 --> 01:46:43.400]   Facebook that comes to super bowl they've not done that before no this I think it's new
[01:46:43.960 --> 01:46:45.960]   You could really try to favorite
[01:46:45.960 --> 01:46:48.120]   Facebook hub
[01:46:48.120 --> 01:46:50.120]   It's all all things
[01:46:50.120 --> 01:46:53.080]   Super facebook.com/super bowl stuff
[01:46:53.080 --> 01:46:58.360]   You know you can just go tune in there and post and if you start tweeting for it
[01:46:58.360 --> 01:47:02.680]   You can't tweet if you do a post on that page right now. It'll tell everybody you're watching the super bowl
[01:47:02.680 --> 01:47:03.720]   Oh
[01:47:03.720 --> 01:47:08.840]   Like try to update status and it'll automatically say watching super bowl if you're like, uh, that's kind of hard
[01:47:08.920 --> 01:47:13.400]   If i'm sitting on this hub really yeah, see see where it says update status scroll down
[01:47:13.400 --> 01:47:16.920]   Just just put anything in there should put your cursor in there. Okay, click
[01:47:16.920 --> 01:47:18.680]   Uh, I
[01:47:18.680 --> 01:47:19.080]   I
[01:47:19.080 --> 01:47:22.680]   I post type of test. You should see it see I am
[01:47:22.680 --> 01:47:25.480]   Oh my god, you're right
[01:47:25.480 --> 01:47:30.680]   Not watching the super bowl right now
[01:47:30.680 --> 01:47:36.680]   And post that and now it says very confusingly. I am while i'm not
[01:47:37.160 --> 01:47:39.160]   Yeah, that'd be amazing if I were
[01:47:39.160 --> 01:47:45.400]   And then oh look at it. Look at how it handles this has got a little thing with the logos of each team
[01:47:45.400 --> 01:47:49.240]   A little football emoji
[01:47:49.240 --> 01:47:52.120]   Wow
[01:47:52.120 --> 01:47:56.360]   This is uh, this is good marketing
[01:47:56.360 --> 01:48:03.080]   Yeah, so they want to get people up there. This is the worst by the way picture, uh in their band and their
[01:48:03.880 --> 01:48:05.880]   They're banner at the top. Yeah, what is that?
[01:48:05.880 --> 01:48:11.160]   I it's it's a blurry. It's literally a blurry photo of of phoenix
[01:48:11.160 --> 01:48:13.960]   It looks like deflated football, but it's all
[01:48:13.960 --> 01:48:16.760]   Okay, so so facebook here's a little tip
[01:48:16.760 --> 01:48:22.680]   Uh, when you do a big picture at the top of your page only the top part shows up
[01:48:22.680 --> 01:48:25.880]   So those in focus football helmets actually
[01:48:25.880 --> 01:48:29.000]   aren't visible giant turds it's
[01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:33.080]   You'd think facebook could know how to use facebook a little better than that
[01:48:33.880 --> 01:48:35.720]   Look at that
[01:48:35.720 --> 01:48:38.360]   Just you know here's a little tip
[01:48:38.360 --> 01:48:43.080]   You can go right in there and you could scroll your image around until the football helmets
[01:48:43.080 --> 01:48:48.040]   Are the visible portion of the image? I would just maybe I like the I like the cactus
[01:48:48.040 --> 01:48:51.240]   Behind doing the middle finger blurry cactus
[01:48:51.240 --> 01:48:55.240]   It's the blurry cactus picture. What is this?
[01:48:55.240 --> 01:48:59.320]   Oh, there's a football in it too. Wow facebook
[01:49:01.160 --> 01:49:03.160]   What the hell?
[01:49:03.160 --> 01:49:09.080]   Don't you even know how your platform works? You know what it's probably looks better on your mobile the intern did it
[01:49:09.080 --> 01:49:13.640]   Probably looks probably looks great on mobile mobile first. Whoo-hoo. That's how we do it
[01:49:13.640 --> 01:49:22.120]   Mobile first. Now I got to try this facebook. Oh, but see I don't have the facebook app on my mobile
[01:49:22.120 --> 01:49:25.960]   So it's don't know why should I hate facebook?
[01:49:27.800 --> 01:49:33.080]   You know that you're not watching the super bowl on it. I hate I'm not watching the super bowl on facebook
[01:49:33.080 --> 01:49:39.720]   I hate it. Let me see just got a curiosity. What's a strong word leo? I'll have to walk in and all sorts of crap
[01:49:39.720 --> 01:49:43.880]   No facebook makes me feel bad about myself
[01:49:43.880 --> 01:49:47.720]   Whenever I use it like right now

[01:51:37.560 --> 01:51:41.000]   I can't find the line. Maybe that's just because i'm getting old
