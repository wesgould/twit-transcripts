[00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:05.760]   We cover the latest from the Google verse which is no we don't know we don't know
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:12.720]   No, we just do whatever we bloody well whatever we bloody well, please and that's probably because of this guy who's always done
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.400]   Exactly what he bloody well, please is that's Jeff Jarvis the president
[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:25.600]   I just made you the president of the townite center. You're the director of the townite Center for entrepreneurial journalism at that Craig
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.720]   Newmark graduate school of journalism. Yeah, you know is you New York?
[00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.600]   Craig Newmark
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.600]   How you doing Jeff?
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:41.520]   Well, I'm big big news big news. I don't we will use a haircut first. I got a haircut
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.040]   How'd you do that it just I went to where we're open officially I went asks
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:52.000]   So okay, yeah, I got my haircut too, but I did it do it on my back deck
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   I I like being outside
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:02.720]   And masks and there you go here and got a haircut to look at him and prove no, that's not Stacy Higaboth
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.640]   I'm Stacy you changed she shamed her head
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:13.160]   That's aunt pro it of tech news weekly. You got to fix that lower third there mr. JB
[00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:15.600]   Rockman
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.800]   Come on mr. Brockman. She'll miss rock was Stacy has taken the day off
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:25.440]   She's not feeling well, but we are really glad that aunt could be here. Yes, actually we kind of were planning on having you here anyway
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.640]   I think so
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.400]   We just glad to be here. I just threw one of the monitors off the set and that's all it's right
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.360]   It's an easy thing to either now normally we talk about Facebook. We talk about Google Twitter
[00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.200]   We kind of talk about internet and policy issues
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:47.280]   Journalism that kind of thing to you know, sir last time I was on we talked Google the last time I was on
[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:54.440]   We just got a grief for not always doing Google well or all Google
[00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:01.760]   But this show is really about the world Google is in right. It's not Larry Page Island here. This is everything
[00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.760]   All over the whole it were
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:10.680]   So if we were on Larry Page Island, we wouldn't be talking about Apple anyway
[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:17.840]   But do you did you are you at all enter? It's funny because Windows weekly ended up being half about Apple. Whoa Apple made
[00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.800]   the most significant announcement it's made in years on
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:30.760]   Monday at its worldwide developer conference they announced that they were going to abandon Intel chips and
[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:37.720]   Over the next two years transition to chips. They make themselves out. They called it Apple silicon and
[00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:45.960]   It's it's a big deal in the tech world. I don't know if it's a really a big deal in this space that we cover
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.360]   But it is going to change
[00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.160]   I think I think potentially
[00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.760]   Here's here's here's why I think it's a big deal in
[00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:01.260]   2007 Apple announced the iPhone a lot of people laughed Steve bomber Microsoft famously said that'll never sell
[00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:08.040]   Of course a surprise a lot of people and I think the iPhone completely changed the face of technology
[00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:13.040]   And this to me seems like the second act of that transition
[00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:18.680]   So the iPhone began the transition to mobile a space where Intel could not play they tried
[00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:22.480]   But no phone runs on Intel micro processors
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:25.480]   maybe Intel radios in there, but only because
[00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:28.840]   Apple was mad at Qualcomm
[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:34.520]   Intel really missed the mobile revolution and I think
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.720]   This is the continue this is the next step where Apple says you know
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:46.360]   Are we might as well build on this very successful base of iPhone and iPad that we've got and make and transition our hardware?
[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.960]   Everything in our hardware to Apple just let's make everything
[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:57.360]   There's a certain benefit to that, but it's also a monoculture. It's always risky and a computing monoculture might be risky
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:03.280]   I think it's less risky right now than it's ever been because and and this is what we were talking about on Windows weekly from
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.360]   Microsoft's point of view
[00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:11.600]   It doesn't really matter because ever since their new CEO Satya Nadella took over five years ago
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:18.240]   He's been saying it's not about the processor or the computer you're using it's all about the cloud
[00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:26.840]   Services. Yeah, that's why Chromebooks can work exactly right Google understands that Google is a cloud first company
[00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:31.600]   Microsoft isn't is becoming a cloud first company right is there any
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:36.280]   Development in chips kind of waiting out there
[00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:42.160]   I remember even when I started on the show was the you know whatever the new version of the 808 is out
[00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.360]   I'm obviously that's not it, but you know
[00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:51.080]   We would talk about about new chips and things and say oh look it's new and have it for a long time
[00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:54.320]   Is there anything that's kind of we're waiting for?
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:59.440]   We're in an interesting time because I don't in the first
[00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:06.080]   40 years of personal computing that was very exciting and innovative and there was lots of innovation
[00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:14.200]   We've really settled down. It's like saying is there another Google waiting in the wings is there another Facebook waiting in the wings
[00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:21.360]   Is there I think there are click or I think if they are I don't know if I see it happening within the next
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:27.920]   Five years anything like that. It's just so much of a foothold by all the day existing companies right now
[00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:31.120]   and it's even worse with microprocessors because
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:35.560]   You have to create a platform that people develop on for you to succeed. So
[00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:41.160]   It's hard to say well, I got a platform. I got Larry's platform. What do you think?
[00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:47.640]   Or no, it's like no you got a pass pass. I already you know and
[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:54.600]   So that for a long time that was Windows and Mac by the way never got anywhere. It never got to double digit
[00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:57.880]   Market share ever
[00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:59.200]   Mac
[00:07:59.200 --> 00:08:01.560]   Windows is always 90% or more market share
[00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:06.400]   But that's but what's but that's rugs been pulled right out from under them because it doesn't matter anymore
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:10.360]   Because there's a billion iPhones out there all of a sudden
[00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:16.680]   So windows may be percent. Oh, yeah always that's back in the days. No still is
[00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:21.320]   Linux is one or two percent Apple is four or five percent
[00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:24.040]   Chrome what?
[00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:32.120]   Chrome is less than that even windows is winter are more than two billion people using Microsoft Windows right now. Wow. I
[00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:34.680]   Haven't used Microsoft products in years
[00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:42.760]   Not good not cuz I'm trying not to it just I don't have a need to well that really that's part of the point is you don't need to
[00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:48.960]   No one needs to and the transition I think we're seeing is you know these old days of operating system wars
[00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:55.760]   Don't make a whole lot of sense anymore than browser wars make a sense any sense you're but I do think there are there are step changes out there
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:09:01.840]   I mean I've been I've been fond of saying that the Internet is made for speaking and it's not yet made for listening and
[00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:08.080]   And I think I think all the hoo-hoo you screaming on about Facebook is is not sneaks is
[00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:15.240]   meaningless frankly, but I do think that there's a step change waiting in social I
[00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:22.040]   Think that there are step changes waiting especially in the COVID era in how we connect with each other in new ways
[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:28.440]   I think there are step changes in product search and who wins that and and that's not fully
[00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:34.800]   Amazon isn't isn't the be on end all there they are in the in the infrastructure, but they're not necessarily in search
[00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:36.800]   So I think there may be things to come well
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:41.400]   Well, let's let's look at that point about social about someone else stepping in
[00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:49.040]   Several people have tried within the last five five years and probably within the last five to ten years and have failed
[00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:56.800]   Clearly failed. What's the difference? What is the seat so that's going to put them over the current?
[00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:00.360]   Social leaders right now to Twitter and Facebook
[00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:06.820]   It's a three question now. I think that the problem is all of those places try to replicate Facebook
[00:10:06.820 --> 00:10:09.760]   And so they all fight last year by the last war
[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:12.720]   Like regulators
[00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:19.440]   What but that's the thing people go away Facebook, you know, I don't think it goes away
[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:21.760]   We know we have seen
[00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:23.080]   Instagram and tiktok
[00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:28.060]   You know, we have seen that as a as a not a big step change, but a you know, little baby step
[00:10:28.060 --> 00:10:32.160]   Okay, yeah, I don't think anybody's gonna replace
[00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:36.200]   Well
[00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:39.240]   connections right now so we're talking over each other without meaning
[00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:41.800]   Very not hearing each other very famously
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:48.280]   That's why Facebook bought Instagram because Instagram like to talk now at the time posed a threat to Facebook
[00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:52.560]   So Facebook acquired them remember though Facebook was very worried about snapchat
[00:10:52.880 --> 00:11:00.640]   And for a while it looked like maybe snapchat would be the new, you know, Facebook until Facebook added snap like features
[00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:06.640]   Instagram and clobbered them and I think that's why the network effect is so important in this
[00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:11.340]   You can be a better service and come along, but everybody's on Facebook
[00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:15.960]   So right it's a tough think about the fact that how many times
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:24.040]   People say okay, I want to try Twitter, but I don't get it because it's not Facebook. It's not like Facebook or
[00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:31.540]   Even go way back since this is this we can Google with Google plus they go into these different platforms
[00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:34.840]   Plus thing
[00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:40.440]   Yeah, nobody's here. I don't know anybody social network requires
[00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:43.240]   Everybody you know to be there. It's no good
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:49.840]   So that's how many people I mean Google with all its resources couldn't beat Facebook snapchat Facebook tried to buy them
[00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:51.840]   They said no so Facebook said okay
[00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:57.920]   Although snapchat's not dead. It's interesting. They've kind of hung in there
[00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:00.600]   I don't think the problem is Facebook is fast
[00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:04.480]   Facebook can do anything that you can do Facebook can do and so
[00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:08.760]   Because everybody's on Facebook if they do it even half as well as you do
[00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:13.360]   They can they can say people say well, you know, I can kind of get that on Facebook
[00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:15.600]   I don't know why people aren't duplicating tick-tock
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:20.400]   What about what about the Chinese the other Chinese services though that that do every bit of trend, you know
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:26.040]   Yeah, well that's what Facebook wants to do, but it wants to be but they're not I don't know why they must be hard to do
[00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:28.040]   I don't know what's go
[00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:39.460]   You've turned blue blue blue blue blue blue so sorry we were both distracted by a ant's picture which we shouldn't I don't
[00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:43.280]   It's so hard thing to say you know, it's very easy
[00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:49.400]   You know to say and oh DOS will never be replaced
[00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:52.180]   We're dominant we own the world
[00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:58.280]   And CPM you mean right yeah, so it's very easy to say that in history you just says well, you know
[00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:05.380]   Well my beer but on the other hand it is we are at the scale now where you know Facebook has everybody pretty much
[00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:08.940]   At Google has everybody for search
[00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:13.340]   There are computer competing services, but there's a con there's
[00:13:13.340 --> 00:13:19.580]   There's this network effect. It's hard to beat. I don't know as for it to answer your question chip makers sure
[00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:21.580]   There are lots of them out there
[00:13:21.660 --> 00:13:26.940]   But most of them are gonna end up doing either arm or x86 the two major
[00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:31.860]   There's nothing we're dying to wait for them. There's no third architecture coming along saying hey
[00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:37.040]   I'm as good as x86 and arm. I'm better you'd have to be a lot better because there's all this there's this all this
[00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:44.260]   Install base using one of the other of those that's why it's really interesting to watch what Apple's doing because desktop has been owned by Intel
[00:13:44.260 --> 00:13:46.700]   even AMD which makes
[00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:51.220]   Chips makes Intel compatible chips. Otherwise they couldn't possibly succeed
[00:13:51.220 --> 00:13:55.620]   So so there's so and I know you're an AMD fan
[00:13:55.620 --> 00:14:01.220]   But but you wouldn't be using it and if it couldn't run Windows and all the software that you use you would consider it
[00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:05.360]   That's correct. So you know, but Apple has a lot of clout though
[00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:07.700]   that's why they would do it with their history of
[00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:12.140]   Running those a chips on those on the micro side of things and
[00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:16.540]   Continuing to be the leader in checking out what people are doing now
[00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:22.640]   Farce their competitors checking out what their competitors are doing now and then coming back and saying you know what?
[00:14:22.640 --> 00:14:23.460]   We can do that too
[00:14:23.460 --> 00:14:27.800]   and we're gonna be able to do it better because we've been watching all of the mistakes that you've made and
[00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:30.420]   Hey kudos to him
[00:14:30.420 --> 00:14:37.780]   It I think it's gonna work because it's still Apple and people are still gonna want to go to Apple and they just have the
[00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:41.780]   I think they just got all the money in the right spot for us are in de goes
[00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:48.900]   I think what they've done to the professional creators out there that spent, you know, 10 grand on a workstation that's
[00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:53.260]   Pretty much gonna be if you get a faster workstation
[00:14:53.260 --> 00:15:00.300]   That so you're you just built your R AMD machine, but if what it's time to consider the next one
[00:15:00.300 --> 00:15:03.820]   If Apple offered something faster less expensive
[00:15:03.820 --> 00:15:09.220]   That ran all the software you wanted to run you'd consider it, wouldn't you? Oh, yeah
[00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:13.980]   I like OS X or Mac OS whatever now. Oh Mac was 11 now
[00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:17.980]   They went to a you know, I like the Mac operating system
[00:15:17.980 --> 00:15:20.220]   I just and I and I've
[00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:28.020]   Respected the hardware is just a price. I could never justify the cost of the Apple products, but their hardware is beautiful
[00:15:28.020 --> 00:15:31.420]   The operating system runs so dad gone well
[00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:37.220]   You don't have all the hiccups and jumping through hoops and things like that, but I
[00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:40.620]   Couldn't justify the dollar
[00:15:40.620 --> 00:15:44.460]   Yeah, although I have to point out. I mean you couldn't put together a
[00:15:44.460 --> 00:15:47.900]   Mac pro running windows of
[00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:51.660]   That hardware level at a lower price. It's not
[00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:55.780]   You know, I mean and the difference is gonna be
[00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:58.900]   You won't in part of the benefit to the Apple
[00:15:58.900 --> 00:16:02.260]   I don't think it's the reason they're doing this is you won't be able to make a head-to-head comparison anymore
[00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:09.180]   Right you won't it's not using it. It's been using off the shelf parts to some great degree. That's not gonna be the case
[00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:15.940]   Kevin told us back to the roots of Apple, right? Wasn't that the roots of Apple from
[00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:22.900]   Way back in the 80s is we want to control the hardware and do it our way. Yeah, they never were big enough to
[00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:25.340]   do it entirely
[00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:32.340]   So they've always had Intel chips or before that they had Motorola chips or chips from power PC
[00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:39.620]   They are now big enough there. They're a one and a half trillion dollar company with 200 billion dollars plus in cash
[00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:46.060]   They have a billion products out there. They have a secret weapon to and they was just one line in the keynote
[00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:51.020]   Oh, and by the way all your iOS apps will run unmodified on your mat on your new Macs
[00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:58.980]   So suddenly and you know this and you know that there's some really good iPad photography apps out there
[00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:02.460]   Increasingly I'm able to use the iPad for my workflow
[00:17:02.460 --> 00:17:09.420]   I you know not just Adobe products. There's right. There's there's a there's a five dollar
[00:17:09.420 --> 00:17:15.380]   pixel-meter photo program which in some respects it's good kicks Adobe's butt
[00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:22.140]   It's really photo. There's all these great iPad so that will all be able to use it for video
[00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:25.220]   Yes, and you'll be able to put that on your new Mac
[00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:32.140]   So that's another secret weapon Kevin Tofel wrote a very interesting article on his about Chromebooks
[00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:36.980]   Apple's own chips inside arm power and by the way apples never using the arm word
[00:17:36.980 --> 00:17:41.300]   We have to stop doing that Apple silicon powered Mac books
[00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:45.660]   Show why Google needs to make custom silicon for Chromebooks
[00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:48.660]   I don't know about that. It's a TOEFL
[00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:56.380]   It makes a strong argument. I think one of the reasons Apple is doing it is because Intel has just not been able to live up to its
[00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:58.740]   promise and so Apple just got tired of waiting and
[00:17:58.740 --> 00:18:02.460]   Google has been able to live up to its hardware promises well
[00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:06.860]   No, but there any but they're but being tried to Qualcomm or Intel
[00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:16.380]   Is it necessarily ideal you these are general purpose chips one of the advantages Apple gets is it can design chips for its own operating systems and hardware
[00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:19.100]   System so that they're perfectly tuned
[00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:22.400]   Google has the resources they're big enough they could design
[00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:25.340]   Chrome OS chips. I don't think they will
[00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:33.060]   Because they have a pretty brisk ecosystem of third-party hardware manufacturers that something Apple doesn't have to worry about
[00:18:33.060 --> 00:18:36.180]   Let's see I hear that and I think about
[00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:39.460]   the pixel line of phones and
[00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:42.780]   The mistakes that Google has made there
[00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:46.180]   I don't even think you could say that the pixel book is the best Chromebook
[00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:50.140]   Oh, well the old one was really good
[00:18:50.140 --> 00:18:55.420]   The pixel book is no I've seen this ready to buy a new one
[00:18:55.420 --> 00:19:01.140]   I know I'm 13. Yeah, sir 713 is the first one I've seen it starts, but I think it has fans
[00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:03.900]   Well, it will if it if you get the
[00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:11.500]   10th generation Intel process fans or a killer for me. I don't want fans 16 gig up to 16 gigs of RAM up to 256 gigs storage
[00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:13.980]   10 hours
[00:19:13.980 --> 00:19:20.780]   And it's a three by two which I think is that's what pixel book is is I think that's a good aspect ratio for Chrome OS
[00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:27.260]   629 dollars. That's the starting price when it launches in July. There'll be an enterprise version
[00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:31.460]   Which will be a start at eleven hundred dollars
[00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:33.500]   yes
[00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:41.180]   That has like like services to yeah, it is the chrome enterprise security solution is the big yeah
[00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:47.940]   So let me ask you a question. Oh chip gurus chip jockeys actually station chip jockey
[00:19:47.940 --> 00:19:52.500]   Yeah, that's not here. Hold her stirrups. We'll we'll make do
[00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:55.300]   I'll make do with you two
[00:19:55.300 --> 00:19:58.380]   Android question
[00:19:58.380 --> 00:19:59.340]   I
[00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:01.340]   Have a sense that Moore's law
[00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:05.180]   Affected obviously affected mainframes and all that stuff that it affected
[00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:11.540]   Computers in your in your lap and then apart from ant building you know turbocharged
[00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:17.380]   Mondo machine it seems like that Moore's law has less effect now. It's more about the
[00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:22.780]   Every year any is not double and be this yet speeds fine, but it doesn't you know how much does it matter?
[00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:26.620]   Well, that's what Apple's saying is Intel can't get it together
[00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:31.260]   To give them the improvements and processor performance that they expect
[00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:34.260]   Apple thinks that thinks that they can
[00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:40.420]   What have there are a couple of things happened x86 which is the architecture we've been using since the 70s
[00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:47.340]   Still works. Yeah, not very well. It's a real. It's a ugly ugly architecture
[00:20:47.340 --> 00:20:52.980]   But it's dominant because again because it's got you know all the software works on it
[00:20:52.980 --> 00:21:00.900]   Intel even wanted to abandon it. You remember itanium. They were moving on to a new technology and they and it was too hot and
[00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:05.060]   They actually it flopped the itanium was horrible
[00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:08.980]   Thankfully they had a little skunk works in Israel
[00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:11.980]   working on
[00:21:11.980 --> 00:21:17.820]   different models of x86 chips using new technologies they said quick can you get something together and
[00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:20.580]   the idea of leaving x86 just
[00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:25.060]   Disappeared 20 years ago and in hell has continued on with x86
[00:21:25.060 --> 00:21:29.180]   But there's but they're now up against that wall they were up against with itanium which is
[00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:34.140]   They're they're limited. They just barely are able to get past four gigahertz now
[00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:35.620]   They're starting to get closer to five
[00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:43.340]   But that speed is limited because of heat because of thermals because these chips they use a lot of power the very high power chips
[00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:51.980]   They're also running into problems with that thing that this the little Israel start Israeli startup came up with which is speculative execution. Oh
[00:21:51.980 --> 00:22:00.100]   It turns out that's a security problem. So they're running into that and it turns out every chip that's been made since
[00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:03.100]   itanium is vulnerable to that and then
[00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:08.460]   they're because it uses so much power they can't get mobile and
[00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:10.620]   and
[00:22:10.620 --> 00:22:17.820]   They're having trouble for reasons. I don't know the details on Stacy probably does getting to the new processes
[00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:24.540]   They can they can barely got to 10 nanometers and already we're seeing arm chips done at I think
[00:22:24.540 --> 00:22:28.740]   So I think TSMC announced it's kind of a quasi for nanometers
[00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:34.500]   Which by the way does come up against quantum physics you get
[00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:39.220]   You have actually you're so so tiny now that you're having issues with quantum tunneling and things
[00:22:39.220 --> 00:22:43.300]   It's hard to keep the electrons in line. They keep jumping in different states. So
[00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:45.700]   there's all sorts of
[00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:49.700]   walls that x86 has hit and
[00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:58.420]   That's really what happened. I think AMD showed you can go past those walls with a rise in but they're still I think they're still
[00:22:58.820 --> 00:23:07.700]   They're just making a compatible. It's like compact. They're making an Intel compatible chip and that's I don't and by the way
[00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:11.860]   They also because they spend so much money in time making these incredible rise in chips
[00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:15.700]   They let their GPUs lag behind in Vidya and
[00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:19.540]   Now by the way, nobody mentioned this Apple's not going to use
[00:23:19.540 --> 00:23:26.860]   AMD GPUs either this is bad news for a make their own it's all apple or silicon
[00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:34.900]   Now AMD is still competing on a GPU side, but not on the consumer level
[00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:37.600]   They're doing more with that upper echelon
[00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:41.540]   Yeah, they couldn't do both they didn't they weren't a big enough company to do both
[00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:47.220]   So in Vidya one and in Laptom several times in my opinion with graphics cards, you know
[00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:50.900]   But they're still releasing those pro-grade GPUs to compete with the
[00:23:50.900 --> 00:23:57.140]   Like the Vega the Vega Pro and stuff like that right but that's not as good as an Nvidia card
[00:23:57.140 --> 00:24:00.540]   What are you using your box using a video card? I'm sure I'm still an Nvidia
[00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:05.300]   No gamer worth assaults using a Radeon
[00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:11.860]   Yeah, and actually that's but I use it for the creative cloud and the CUDA course right you know CUDA course
[00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:17.460]   So that's another big question. We don't know the answer of apple. I'm sure because remember apple
[00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:24.980]   Um that ever is never you know liked in Vidya in Vidya last year said that's it. We're not writing drivers for apple stuff
[00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:29.540]   That's it. No more Nvidia on apple. You're stuck with vega good luck apple
[00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:34.340]   But apple didn't care they made no effort to fix that that's we now know why
[00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:38.340]   Because they weren't going to go with AMD or in Vidya. They were going to do their own thing
[00:24:38.340 --> 00:24:43.540]   And this is what really will be interest. I think there's reason to believe that they can make competitive products
[00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:47.540]   But we don't know the GPUs in the ipad are very good
[00:24:47.540 --> 00:24:54.100]   But we don't know if they can make compatible desktop compatible compared to in Vidya
[00:24:54.740 --> 00:24:58.820]   And I also wonder you know, they're gonna there's a lot of challenges here
[00:24:58.820 --> 00:25:00.260]   Um
[00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:03.220]   Remember apple does not it doesn't do open gl
[00:25:03.220 --> 00:25:07.300]   They don't do CUDA. They don't do open cl really they do metal
[00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:10.340]   And now we also we're just doing good. Oh, it's very good
[00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:14.500]   But now we also understand why all of a sudden this push on metal and dumping everything else
[00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:17.220]   either because
[00:25:17.220 --> 00:25:23.300]   This is the new way going forward if you were using metal and all apple apis and you were doing everything on the ios platform
[00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:26.980]   That apple recommended your stuff suddenly works with the new desktops
[00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:31.300]   And and you don't have to do any recoding at all
[00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:35.540]   Uh, and if you have an existing x86 slash radion
[00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:40.100]   Architecture, but if you use metal that's going to be a little easier for you
[00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:45.060]   It's just might most cases just flip a few switches on the compiler and you'll be compatible
[00:25:45.060 --> 00:25:49.460]   And then you know, there'll be some 10 percent of apps that's going to have to it's going to be painful
[00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:52.340]   Maybe we'll maybe never make the transition
[00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:58.340]   So it's i really want to see what apple's gpu strategy is because that's what's going to matter to you aunt
[00:25:58.340 --> 00:26:03.300]   If you can do a galsian blur in in 10 times faster
[00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:08.660]   On apple gpu then you can on your ray traced in vidia
[00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:12.980]   That's going to be compelling. Yeah, see okay
[00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:18.180]   And i have it as worth it to pay more. Yeah, or but you might not even
[00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:25.620]   It's not a question of pay more. You can't get it any other way. Yeah, it's it's not whether it's more. It's whether you can get it
[00:26:25.620 --> 00:26:30.660]   And that's so i have a feeling that apple must have looked at this
[00:26:30.660 --> 00:26:33.300]   They know that that's one of the issues and they must feel that they can
[00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:41.460]   It makes me wonder how long this discussion has been going on with apple because i can remember when adobe acquired
[00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:44.660]   uh metal couple years back
[00:26:44.660 --> 00:26:46.740]   and
[00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:51.220]   Most of the adobe demos are done on max and i can remember to talk about
[00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:54.100]   uh, just the performance increase and
[00:26:54.100 --> 00:27:00.100]   Yada yada yada and i'm thinking have they already been talking since then and i assume they have well, i don't know
[00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:05.380]   How long ago apple said they in fact they showed lightroom photoshop running
[00:27:05.380 --> 00:27:08.340]   On the and by the way the development machine
[00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:12.500]   Devoutment machine is basically an ipad pro with more ram
[00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:17.380]   This crazy in fact their whole demos the demos they did they didn't say anything until later
[00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:21.860]   They demos they did of every all the max stuff would turn out was running on that dev kit
[00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:27.060]   Which is running the ipad pro processor, which is certainly slower than what they'll put out in a desktop so
[00:27:27.060 --> 00:27:34.420]   Um, right. I mean, you know what when i got that ipad pro i even said this many times this thing's way overpowered
[00:27:34.420 --> 00:27:36.340]   For
[00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:42.020]   Running ios apps this thing's got headroom galore and all everybody said was apple always does that
[00:27:42.100 --> 00:27:45.220]   That's why in a couple of years you'll be able to run the latest and greatest no
[00:27:45.220 --> 00:27:52.100]   They were developing their first first iteration at a desktop chip and and gpu's
[00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:56.260]   So, uh, I think it's you were beta test and base. Yeah, we were beta testers
[00:27:56.260 --> 00:28:00.020]   Now I think they'll even go beyond that with their their rumored
[00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:05.940]   They'll be a new mac laptop this year a 13 inch macbook pro running silicon from apple and and
[00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:11.300]   Ming chi quo who's pretty well connected in the apple rumor mill. He's the supply side guy says
[00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:13.860]   all apple computers
[00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:16.820]   Starting in 2021 will be running on apple silicon
[00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:21.220]   So the apple's really fast apple said two years
[00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:25.860]   They said that last time too on the intel transition. They did the intel transition in nine months
[00:28:25.860 --> 00:28:30.020]   I suspect really fast two years. Yeah, I think it'll be one
[00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:33.940]   So this is so the reason we're talking about on this show and every other show
[00:28:33.940 --> 00:28:36.980]   Is the world just shifted?
[00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:40.580]   in a significant way
[00:28:41.780 --> 00:28:43.780]   What was up to that one and
[00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:46.820]   Go ahead jeff we've been gassing on and on
[00:28:46.820 --> 00:28:49.460]   Well, no, that's because the question for both of you is apple that good
[00:28:49.460 --> 00:28:53.620]   Do you have the faith that they're gonna be better than anybody else with their chips or just that they're
[00:28:53.620 --> 00:29:00.180]   They're pretty purpose made that I bet well they have that advantage on that ipad's pretty impressive
[00:29:00.180 --> 00:29:06.420]   I think they're good because they know they're their system. They you know is again. It's more of the
[00:29:06.420 --> 00:29:11.620]   If they're going to bake a cake, they know all the ingredients going in because they hand picked them
[00:29:12.340 --> 00:29:14.340]   I wouldn't bet against them
[00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:19.540]   They've chosen a tough road, but you're exactly right. They wouldn't have done it if they didn't know the recipe
[00:29:19.540 --> 00:29:22.500]   And they didn't have the oven already preheated
[00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:26.020]   Yeah, they they've already been working on it. They got that pay increased
[00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:28.100]   They are
[00:29:28.100 --> 00:29:30.100]   It was already so
[00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:35.300]   And they had there are a trillion and a half dollar company with hundreds of billions of dollars in the bank
[00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:39.700]   They have more than 1000 chip developers. They acquired a chip design firm p.a
[00:29:40.180 --> 00:29:43.780]   Semi a long time ago. I wish Stacy were here. This is really her
[00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:47.940]   Bailey wick, but they have been acquiring this talent
[00:29:47.940 --> 00:29:51.620]   You don't know apple clearly thinks they can
[00:29:51.620 --> 00:29:55.140]   I and I wouldn't bet against him, but you know, it's not guaranteed
[00:29:55.140 --> 00:29:58.740]   We could look back in five years and say boy that was a mistake
[00:29:58.740 --> 00:30:05.300]   I said the same thing with intel effect. That was really unhappy when they shifted the intel. I thought oh, this is the end of the world
[00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:07.620]   I love power pc. Where are you going to that x86?
[00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:11.300]   I hated them. I hate x86
[00:30:11.300 --> 00:30:14.340]   And I what was your mistake
[00:30:14.340 --> 00:30:21.780]   What was it that apple did at virginia tech many years ago? Was it the ball to the power cluster? Yeah, they did a giant supercomputer
[00:30:21.780 --> 00:30:24.100]   Is that what you're talking about?
[00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:26.980]   Yeah, that's what it was and i'm thinking like is there more of that
[00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:30.340]   Coming down the pike for apple just to sort of give
[00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:34.900]   proof of concept that says you know what we're not going anywhere and
[00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:38.100]   Matter of fact, we're probably going to come after you a ws
[00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:40.980]   This was something called system 10
[00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:47.220]   It was which is kind of ironic because os 10 was coming. This is in the summer of 2003
[00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:51.780]   It was 1,100 power mac g phi at g5 computers
[00:30:51.780 --> 00:30:55.860]   Power mac says what it was it ran until 2012
[00:30:55.860 --> 00:30:58.580]   And it was fast
[00:30:58.580 --> 00:31:02.420]   It wasn't that fast we're talking pedaflops these days with the supercomputers
[00:31:02.420 --> 00:31:06.980]   Multiple pedaflops by the way the fat one of the fastest computers out there is running an arm chips
[00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:15.380]   So it was 15 years ago on june 6 2005 the jobs revealed that apple would switch from the power pc to intel
[00:31:15.380 --> 00:31:17.940]   Yeah
[00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:22.260]   And they did pretty darn quickly the fastest supercomputer in the world
[00:31:22.260 --> 00:31:25.940]   Right now it's called fugaku. It's out of japan
[00:31:25.940 --> 00:31:29.620]   It's running on arm chips fugitsu's
[00:31:29.620 --> 00:31:35.460]   48 core arm chip see one of the things that apple is a great pains to
[00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:39.940]   You know dispel is this notion that oh arms slow
[00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:43.540]   Arm is not inherently slow in fact
[00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:52.100]   It's the fastest computer in the world is based on arms, but that's because which by the way, what did I say the uh system at 10?
[00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:54.260]   was 200
[00:31:54.260 --> 00:31:57.620]   Terraflops fugaku is 415
[00:31:57.620 --> 00:32:00.420]   pedaflops
[00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:03.780]   That's 415 000 times faster
[00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:06.420]   No, i'm sorry
[00:32:06.420 --> 00:32:09.700]   800 000 times faster
[00:32:09.700 --> 00:32:13.140]   It's a lot it's a lot faster
[00:32:13.140 --> 00:32:16.180]   Nice just nuts
[00:32:16.180 --> 00:32:22.100]   By the way, uh, they're using it for uh, covid-19 simulations among other things
[00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:27.140]   Oh, so this is the first time a computer based on our on top the list the timing is very good
[00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:28.820]   that
[00:32:28.820 --> 00:32:30.340]   They announced
[00:32:30.340 --> 00:32:34.180]   A day after apple announced they were going to now
[00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:39.220]   It's not by the way arm and apple didn't ever mention arm apple has again
[00:32:39.220 --> 00:32:42.980]   It's Stacy needs to be here, but apple has what they call an architecture license
[00:32:42.980 --> 00:32:48.900]   Which means they can take they've licensed the intellectual property of arm processors apple started arm by the way
[00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:50.900]   They're one of the partners that started arm
[00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:53.220]   They know that yeah
[00:32:53.220 --> 00:32:54.740]   Yeah
[00:32:54.740 --> 00:33:00.260]   They sold off so they have that they have the they've paid for the right to be able to spin off
[00:33:00.260 --> 00:33:09.060]   Into something that was literally compete with it. They've never really made arm chips, but they've used i i'm sure it's the arm instruction set
[00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:10.740]   Some arm
[00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:15.620]   Stuff to build their chips and they call them the a class the first was the a4
[00:33:15.620 --> 00:33:21.780]   Uh, but they've never said these are arm chips. These are our chips, but we have a license for the arm architecture
[00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:24.660]   so, um
[00:33:25.540 --> 00:33:30.340]   I don't think you should think of it as an arm processor you should think of as an apple processor
[00:33:30.340 --> 00:33:33.860]   That's and and that's
[00:33:33.860 --> 00:33:41.620]   That's very interesting. You're not going to like uh this they showed at the event they showed
[00:33:41.620 --> 00:33:44.740]   the apple uh processors running
[00:33:44.740 --> 00:33:47.380]   Linux in on parallels
[00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:50.020]   But right now according to the verge
[00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:54.980]   They the new max will not run bootcamp so you won't be able to
[00:33:54.980 --> 00:34:02.180]   You and that's microsoft. That's a licensing issue. So I wouldn't be surprised if that changed by the time these companies
[00:34:02.180 --> 00:34:06.100]   Shipped neither microsoft nor apple mentioned bootcamp
[00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:08.260]   Um
[00:34:08.260 --> 00:34:14.660]   But apple did say that office is coming for the new max. So maybe it's just a matter of negotiation
[00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:20.180]   And that's coming from books too. You said it was confirmed no bootcamp
[00:34:20.180 --> 00:34:24.820]   Because of licensing but tom warren in the verge says
[00:34:24.820 --> 00:34:28.500]   Uh, microsoft could change the licensing
[00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:32.420]   So because the app microsoft has windows on arm
[00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:36.340]   But they don't license it for use in virtual machines
[00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:41.780]   Or on non, you know, license and the apple's not an oem
[00:34:41.780 --> 00:34:43.940]   You know, licensing
[00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:45.540]   licensee so
[00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:51.220]   That could that's just a that's a legal thing. I don't know if there's a technical issue windows on arm is not impressive
[00:34:51.220 --> 00:34:54.740]   But maybe it's because we haven't seen it on good silicon. I don't know we've only seen it on
[00:34:54.740 --> 00:34:57.700]   Kind of you know qualcom. She may be yeah
[00:34:57.700 --> 00:35:00.500]   Tom will tell
[00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:04.020]   It is good to see stuff like this though because just like you said when we started
[00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:05.860]   uh
[00:35:05.860 --> 00:35:09.700]   The innovation rate has been a bit stale
[00:35:10.340 --> 00:35:14.340]   For the last bit last several years and it's nice to see that something is
[00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:21.700]   Uh on the horizon that could really make a big difference in how people purchase their hardware now. Yeah
[00:35:21.700 --> 00:35:25.460]   Yeah, that's why we're all so excited that because
[00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:30.900]   At least I haven't doing this long enough that I remember when it was, you know, there was something new every week
[00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:33.540]   Mm-hmm
[00:35:33.540 --> 00:35:35.540]   Kind of boring lately
[00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:40.180]   Apple mixing things up is very good news. Yeah, it's gonna make other people compete
[00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:42.980]   Uh, yeah, I think this is good. Yeah
[00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:47.940]   Let's take a little break. We can't we have google stuff. Hey, hey, we got good
[00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:54.260]   We I said google at least three times because my phone picked up so we have covered
[00:35:54.260 --> 00:35:56.820]   Yeah
[00:35:56.820 --> 00:36:03.140]   Yeah, I forgot about that and I and you know we could take a little victory lap because ios 14
[00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:06.180]   Has a lot of android features including widgets
[00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:11.460]   Marques Brownlee's video was so funny. He basically
[00:36:11.460 --> 00:36:14.740]   He basically you did his rundown of the keynote
[00:36:14.740 --> 00:36:19.860]   And he said this looks like something we've already seen before and he said that about four times that he knew he was like, okay
[00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:23.220]   I'm gonna stop. I know yes, this is so is that way
[00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:26.900]   It's always that way look what's wrong with that apple should
[00:36:26.900 --> 00:36:31.860]   Apple shouldn't operate in a vacuum if there's something good. I'm mad that they took so long
[00:36:31.860 --> 00:36:36.900]   But that's the thing that's the apple emo though is taking the things that are already out there
[00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:42.500]   Watching the competition stumbled through it even though it was nice new tech and then say, okay
[00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:45.780]   Let us refine it for you to make it more
[00:36:45.780 --> 00:36:49.300]   Magical as and they did there I don't know um
[00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:53.460]   But i've never seen for instance one of the things they do they have widgets just like
[00:36:53.460 --> 00:36:56.100]   android widgets, you know you could
[00:36:56.100 --> 00:37:01.940]   An application install might have three or four different widget styles big little small different information that kind of stuff
[00:37:01.940 --> 00:37:06.660]   But one thing they showed that I really liked and I don't i've never seen this on any android launcher
[00:37:06.900 --> 00:37:08.420]   You can stack them
[00:37:08.420 --> 00:37:14.980]   So you can have one space with five widgets that you can scroll through which is nice that gives you more widget
[00:37:14.980 --> 00:37:20.340]   Real estate and then the thing I also like they have a smart stack that will show a widget
[00:37:20.340 --> 00:37:23.620]   That's appropriate for the time of day. Maybe the weather when you get up
[00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:27.460]   Maybe uh, you know, what's what to cook for dinner? It's five p.m
[00:37:27.460 --> 00:37:32.260]   Maybe traffic on the way home and you know that kind I think that's kind of cool now
[00:37:32.260 --> 00:37:34.820]   Traditionally these smart things aren't so smart, but
[00:37:35.700 --> 00:37:39.300]   That's something I saw somebody's picture. I couldn't bear what they were talking about here
[00:37:39.300 --> 00:37:44.740]   Who wasn't up, but but I think is the phone also now a widget because I think somebody said this is the end of the iPhone
[00:37:44.740 --> 00:37:47.860]   It's a phone. It's not a phone anymore. The phone is just a just a feature
[00:37:47.860 --> 00:37:53.220]   Is the phone a widget? What do you mean? Is that a point? What is the phone? Is a widget?
[00:37:53.220 --> 00:37:56.340]   I saw a little kind of thing. So, you know somebody calling it was only part of the screen
[00:37:56.340 --> 00:37:59.540]   That's just somebody's uh take hot take. I mean, okay
[00:37:59.540 --> 00:38:03.940]   No, the phone is not a widget, but there are widgets on the iphone the iphone historically
[00:38:04.900 --> 00:38:07.380]   You don't know this jeff because you live in the blissful
[00:38:07.380 --> 00:38:12.020]   Bath of android wonderfulness has only been a grid of icons
[00:38:12.020 --> 00:38:20.500]   And since 2007 though they added a few years later the ability to put things in folders folders folders
[00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:24.180]   They added folders like that was like, oh look at this. We got folders
[00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:28.100]   They've historically always had one thing I hate that android solved years ago
[00:38:28.100 --> 00:38:33.140]   Every program can have exactly one icon. So you can't have
[00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:38.980]   An i as shortcuts. You can't have an icon in a folder and the same program on the best apple
[00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:41.460]   It's so you will do it this way
[00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:43.220]   It's so apple
[00:38:43.220 --> 00:38:47.300]   The other thing that they've changed they did not announce on stage, but they've announced it
[00:38:47.300 --> 00:38:53.700]   Is you're finally going to be able to use somebody else's browser and email program as the default
[00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:57.460]   That's huge. That's something androids always let you do
[00:38:57.460 --> 00:39:00.660]   Let us be clear here that android is less
[00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:03.300]   um anti-trusty than apple
[00:39:03.300 --> 00:39:05.940]   Oh, I know what you mean when you say phone is a widget
[00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:10.900]   Yeah, it's just a little thing when a phone call on another dumb thing
[00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:17.940]   That apple does when the phone rings the whole screen turns into that one little phone thing
[00:39:17.940 --> 00:39:23.300]   It's oh, that's right. So now it's gonna just be a little widget so you don't understand and you can swipe it out
[00:39:23.300 --> 00:39:26.820]   You know, it's the same thing series gonna change too. See watch when I do series
[00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:29.380]   The whole screen goes dark
[00:39:30.900 --> 00:39:35.700]   Like come on series. I don't you know, this is dumb. I can't see my icons
[00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:37.940]   I can't see anything the whole thing is now with giant
[00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:43.380]   Siri thing that's gonna change too. It'll be just a little Cindy right now, and it's not happy
[00:39:43.380 --> 00:39:46.100]   Yeah, let's see what she says
[00:39:46.100 --> 00:39:49.460]   Just a moment you can adjust many of the vision settings
[00:39:49.460 --> 00:39:52.260]   Yeah, but not that one you dope
[00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:57.860]   Not until I get what accent is that? Uh, I think it's south african
[00:39:59.140 --> 00:40:02.100]   I change it all the time. I want different people to come out of my phone
[00:40:02.100 --> 00:40:07.220]   I hope that sometimes some of them will be smarter
[00:40:07.220 --> 00:40:12.660]   Than the original so now it'll be just that glowing icon that is currently like that's
[00:40:12.660 --> 00:40:20.500]   Is that really what you want when you use a series for a search is the whole phone screen is taken up with so there's a few
[00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:23.540]   But that's refinements apple doe is does that?
[00:40:24.260 --> 00:40:30.420]   It's bit by bit and um, I'm glad that makes it close honestly widgets were the main reason I I
[00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:33.540]   switched over to android and I mean I still use an iPhone but
[00:40:33.540 --> 00:40:38.340]   Yeah, which is I love my widgets. Am I you know my pixel 4?
[00:40:38.340 --> 00:40:44.020]   It's all about the widgets. I got a big old widget taken up half the there's only two rows of icons there
[00:40:44.020 --> 00:40:46.420]   And my audio screen
[00:40:46.420 --> 00:40:52.660]   Is is has no icon well as a few icons. It's all widgets. Right. That's how it is with me
[00:40:52.820 --> 00:40:57.140]   Yeah, that's what widgets are good for you can see what the song is you can pause it go to the next one
[00:40:57.140 --> 00:40:59.380]   You don't have to open an app to do it. It's right there
[00:40:59.380 --> 00:41:03.140]   Right there. That's how how it should be anyway apple's gonna do that. We'll see it, you know
[00:41:03.140 --> 00:41:08.820]   It they didn't steal it from and right they looked over there. They looked over the fence in their yard and they said
[00:41:08.820 --> 00:41:16.260]   Well, that's a nice barbecue. I want that five years. I think that's totally fine. Yes. I think that's totally fine. Of course it is
[00:41:16.260 --> 00:41:19.540]   Of course it is because that's what we want
[00:41:20.180 --> 00:41:24.180]   In fact, I'll tell you what my biggest fear about what apple's doing and then we'll take a break
[00:41:24.180 --> 00:41:29.940]   My biggest fear is that apple. This is a weird fear is going to be so compelling
[00:41:29.940 --> 00:41:33.460]   And the apple ecosystem now is going to be so rich
[00:41:33.460 --> 00:41:38.980]   Starting with the watch the phone the tablet the laptop the desktop the tv
[00:41:38.980 --> 00:41:42.260]   That you'll never want to leave that warm apple bath
[00:41:42.260 --> 00:41:48.900]   And all of a sudden for a lot of us maybe half the world would be a mono culture and that's not good for computing
[00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:51.140]   Now
[00:41:51.140 --> 00:41:53.860]   Are you putting this along the lines of what mr
[00:41:53.860 --> 00:41:58.660]   Alex lindsey was alluding to in his office hours the other morning was
[00:41:58.660 --> 00:42:06.180]   Apple is inch and closer and closer to antitrust. He wouldn't elaborate, but he did say that he was the one defending apple's
[00:42:06.180 --> 00:42:08.740]   stance in the app store
[00:42:08.740 --> 00:42:10.900]   um
[00:42:10.900 --> 00:42:12.900]   I'm not so
[00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:16.100]   He said look apple's made a beautiful store a beautiful product
[00:42:16.580 --> 00:42:20.340]   And it's completely fair for them to charge 30 if you want to be in it
[00:42:20.340 --> 00:42:24.420]   That's just the rules of the road. You don't like it go day and yeah go somewhere else. Yeah
[00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:27.380]   That's completely reasonable on the other hand
[00:42:27.380 --> 00:42:35.220]   In some cases anyway, it's rent seeking it's rent taking because you're not doing anything, you know net netflix
[00:42:35.220 --> 00:42:38.020]   Uh, you know
[00:42:38.020 --> 00:42:41.940]   Is doing all the work you're just letting them be on your platform and you're going to charge them for that
[00:42:42.340 --> 00:42:47.940]   So I have a mixed feelings better. I'm actually my pick of the week this week is that new email program so that you can
[00:42:47.940 --> 00:42:50.260]   Look at it and see if it's something you want to
[00:42:50.260 --> 00:42:54.820]   Want to try hey.com. I finally got my invite and I will show you that
[00:42:54.820 --> 00:43:00.740]   New it's a new take on email. It's the one that apple said no you can't be in the app store unless you give us
[00:43:00.740 --> 00:43:03.620]   You have to sign up in your app
[00:43:03.620 --> 00:43:08.420]   And you have to give us 30 percent of that and and hey was very upset
[00:43:08.420 --> 00:43:15.140]   David Hennemeyer Hanson who wrote Ruby on rails and wrote this new app with Jason Freed said no apples monopolistic
[00:43:15.140 --> 00:43:21.700]   They're in trouble. There's a class action suit going on. They're being invested by the EU for two things one of them is that
[00:43:21.700 --> 00:43:28.180]   So an apple made some concessions this week. This is not the apple show, but i'll tell you anyway
[00:43:28.180 --> 00:43:30.660]   They're going to they're going to give
[00:43:30.660 --> 00:43:36.020]   Create an appeal process for developers who aren't happy about being prevented from being in the store
[00:43:36.340 --> 00:43:38.340]   Mm
[00:43:38.340 --> 00:43:41.300]   Let's take a break and then we come back
[00:43:41.300 --> 00:43:44.580]   Google stuff
[00:43:44.580 --> 00:43:50.740]   I don't know if any of these is that interesting i've got i've got something
[00:43:50.740 --> 00:43:55.700]   Okay, i've got i've got i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna it's a Benedict Evans piece that I think i
[00:43:55.700 --> 00:43:59.220]   Love Benedict Evans we've talked about him all the time. All right. Yep. Yep. So i'll do a better
[00:43:59.220 --> 00:44:03.940]   Benedict Evans coming up on zoom on zoom what follows zoom
[00:44:04.500 --> 00:44:06.500]   Oh man now you're ruined it
[00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:11.060]   The sad story of zoom
[00:44:11.060 --> 00:44:14.500]   Which is just raking it in right now. Yeah
[00:44:14.500 --> 00:44:18.660]   Our show today is brought to you by roman
[00:44:18.660 --> 00:44:23.140]   Roman is an awesome online
[00:44:23.140 --> 00:44:25.780]   clinic think of it as a clinic
[00:44:25.780 --> 00:44:32.420]   A digital health clinic for men that let you connect with the doctor licensed in your state for all sorts of
[00:44:32.980 --> 00:44:36.660]   You know they talk about female troubles, but we men we got male troubles
[00:44:36.660 --> 00:44:39.300]   We got male troubles. We do
[00:44:39.300 --> 00:44:42.340]   Let me tell you jeff knows
[00:44:42.340 --> 00:44:48.980]   I got them all yeah, I sent a hair. I got the hair. They do have uh, I know you had prostate issues. They have
[00:44:48.980 --> 00:44:56.100]   Vitamins for prostate health bone health. I'm actually taking their testosterone. It's not actual testosterone
[00:44:56.100 --> 00:45:01.860]   I don't want to do that. I want to go there, but but it's uh supplements vitamin supplements that help with that
[00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:04.580]   Of course the big problem men have
[00:45:04.580 --> 00:45:09.780]   Is erectile dysfunction, but it's something nobody wants to nobody talks about this. No, he wants to admit
[00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:10.580]   Nope
[00:45:10.580 --> 00:45:14.900]   It's embarrassing and often a lot of guys. This is how we're trained as kids
[00:45:14.900 --> 00:45:19.620]   You're an athlete and you know if you got if the ball hit you in little league
[00:45:19.620 --> 00:45:23.060]   Smack you on the thigh and your eyes are watering
[00:45:23.060 --> 00:45:26.660]   The coach says don't rub it
[00:45:26.660 --> 00:45:28.100]   Yeah
[00:45:28.100 --> 00:45:29.460]   Shake it off
[00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:31.460]   There's no crying in baseball
[00:45:31.860 --> 00:45:37.620]   That's right. You're taught that from a very young age rub some dirt in it. It'll rub some dirt on it
[00:45:37.620 --> 00:45:40.820]   That is not good advice
[00:45:40.820 --> 00:45:45.380]   But it teaches us as men to kind of you know and just say i'm gonna tough it out
[00:45:45.380 --> 00:45:47.380]   You know, I don't need a doctor
[00:45:47.380 --> 00:45:51.540]   It's one of the reasons those of us were lucky enough to have a significant other or healthier
[00:45:51.540 --> 00:45:54.180]   because
[00:45:54.180 --> 00:45:58.660]   You've heard it and I'm sure go to the doctor for crying out loud. What's wrong with you?
[00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:01.380]   So
[00:46:01.380 --> 00:46:05.300]   But you know, we don't like to so that's why roman's fantastic the story of roman is great
[00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:07.140]   I've told this before you might have seen it on tv
[00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:12.980]   It's founded by a young guy his dad was a doctor and the young guy was having erect erectile dysfunction
[00:46:12.980 --> 00:46:18.820]   Fortunately instead of just ignoring it as most guys would do his dad's a doctor said dad can I talk to you?
[00:46:18.820 --> 00:46:22.340]   And i'm sure was he was bright red very embarrassing
[00:46:22.340 --> 00:46:26.740]   But his dad knew that's often a sign of other underlying conditions
[00:46:27.460 --> 00:46:31.780]   Got him checked up. Thank goodness his dad was a doctor and he wasn't too embarrassed to talk to him
[00:46:31.780 --> 00:46:34.020]   And that was really the impetus for founding
[00:46:34.020 --> 00:46:40.340]   Roman anyone who's dealt with ed knows it's it's awkward to talk about it in person even to a doctor
[00:46:40.340 --> 00:46:45.300]   But there is a great way to get the treatment you need without leaving the couch perfect time
[00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:47.540]   We're not leaving house. Anyway
[00:46:47.540 --> 00:46:52.660]   Friends at roman have built it spent years doing this a digital platform and their plan is to really go
[00:46:52.660 --> 00:46:56.580]   Just to make it be an entire digital clinic for men

[00:49:05.620 --> 00:49:11.140]   So i'm wondering through everyone's while i go and look at all the german papers and struggle with my german
[00:49:11.140 --> 00:49:16.980]   But just to see what's going on there and i go to their spiegel, which is the you know beyond the time magazine of germany
[00:49:17.060 --> 00:49:19.780]   It's the and they have a youth magazine called bento
[00:49:19.780 --> 00:49:24.740]   So i oh, okay. I click on bento and there is a is a
[00:49:24.740 --> 00:49:28.500]   e-commerce page so it's editorials like it's like
[00:49:28.500 --> 00:49:30.900]   a
[00:49:30.900 --> 00:49:32.900]   Wirecutter
[00:49:32.900 --> 00:49:35.780]   So their spiegel is selling sex toys
[00:49:35.780 --> 00:49:45.540]   I was just a great german. It's so different. It's very german. Yeah, they probably have pictures
[00:49:45.540 --> 00:49:47.540]   We are so yeah, we're very pretty
[00:49:47.540 --> 00:49:53.380]   British here and they just are not the french have naked women on their money. I mean we don't
[00:49:53.380 --> 00:50:00.100]   Well, you can't breastfeed on facebook. That's just the way it is. It's life in this thing i've ever heard of here
[00:50:00.100 --> 00:50:04.980]   I don't I don't know what a tinga mastermator egg is. I don't know what it is. I'll fill you in later
[00:50:04.980 --> 00:50:08.180]   dad
[00:50:08.180 --> 00:50:10.420]   I'll explain later
[00:50:10.420 --> 00:50:12.660]   and there's also a
[00:50:12.660 --> 00:50:14.660]   Be careful here, but there's a
[00:50:14.660 --> 00:50:21.620]   A kit wherein you can um clone your private part what oh, I get it. Yeah, yeah
[00:50:21.620 --> 00:50:24.340]   there used to be um
[00:50:24.340 --> 00:50:28.020]   A group of rock and roll groupies called the plaster casters
[00:50:28.020 --> 00:50:34.420]   I'll leave it in that. Yes. I'll let your imagination rise. I'll get off of this. I'll get off of this
[00:50:34.420 --> 00:50:40.420]   But we americans just oh no and I think we should be sex positive. We glorify in violence
[00:50:41.060 --> 00:50:43.940]   Mm-hmm. You could take a 10-year-old to see a violent movie
[00:50:43.940 --> 00:50:50.740]   But if there's a if there's a bear breast on the 10-year-old knows a lot more about bear breast than violence. This is true
[00:50:50.740 --> 00:50:57.300]   It's like I never understood that I've never understood that sexuality is a wonderful thing
[00:50:57.300 --> 00:50:58.900]   There's no reason yes
[00:50:58.900 --> 00:51:02.820]   Hide and cower in the corner in the shame and I think a lot of that shame
[00:51:02.820 --> 00:51:08.740]   But you know this is this country was originally very puritanical new england was founded by you know
[00:51:09.460 --> 00:51:13.380]   religious puritans and um, yeah, I think that just stuck with us
[00:51:13.380 --> 00:51:20.660]   Did did so anyway, that was that Stacy you're gonna ask you can only say that when Stacy's not Stacy's not here. Yes
[00:51:20.660 --> 00:51:26.340]   Because not no Stacy's just afraid of of where you're gonna go
[00:51:26.340 --> 00:51:31.700]   Well, she knows where I'm gonna go. That's why she should be afraid. I don't blame her one cotton pick and bid
[00:51:31.700 --> 00:51:33.220]   I have no
[00:51:33.220 --> 00:51:35.220]   Filter at all
[00:51:35.380 --> 00:51:39.540]   She's gonna slap you. It's time she sees you and you know what and I'm sure you've experienced this too, Jeff
[00:51:39.540 --> 00:51:45.380]   As you get older, this is aunt. This is on it. You're on your way as you get older your filter dissolves completely
[00:51:45.380 --> 00:51:51.300]   Yeah, it's like I got nothing to lose who cares, right? I'm gonna talk. I mean somebody needs to say it
[00:51:51.300 --> 00:51:57.140]   People people, you know, we have advertisers like get Roman on the on the network
[00:51:57.140 --> 00:52:02.420]   Manscaped was another one right people go. How could you talk about that? What do you mean?
[00:52:02.660 --> 00:52:05.860]   That's why that's there do you have one or not?
[00:52:05.860 --> 00:52:09.700]   Yeah, we all got them
[00:52:09.700 --> 00:52:12.900]   So yeah, I know I honestly
[00:52:12.900 --> 00:52:15.780]   I feel like
[00:52:15.780 --> 00:52:20.980]   Maybe it's age and you probably don't have much filter either. I'm guessing you're pretty polite. No
[00:52:20.980 --> 00:52:26.820]   I'm pretty much what you see what you get. Yeah, pretty black and white not much career. You're with me
[00:52:26.820 --> 00:52:32.180]   Yeah, I feel I always feel like you're very honest like you know, if you say it, it's true. You don't have a lot of
[00:52:32.820 --> 00:52:33.860]   You know
[00:52:33.860 --> 00:52:38.180]   A jet hidden agendas or anything like nope, not at all. I love that. I think that's why we love you
[00:52:38.180 --> 00:52:43.620]   I think honestly as mr. Howl has said to me, man, you wear your emotions on yours. Well, that's true
[00:52:43.620 --> 00:52:47.220]   Yeah, but that's what makes you so makes anybody I think
[00:52:47.220 --> 00:52:52.180]   Was your authentic authentic and lovable. I think that's so important. Thank you
[00:52:52.180 --> 00:52:59.380]   You were gonna ask the Leo benedict's cumber batch. He's one of my favorites. What did he write?
[00:53:01.060 --> 00:53:03.060]   Love him
[00:53:03.060 --> 00:53:05.940]   X of
[00:53:05.940 --> 00:53:13.700]   Edreason Horowitz, yes, and a list I think is great. So he wrote up. He said what comes after zoom
[00:53:13.700 --> 00:53:17.540]   This is a hysterical graph from 1994
[00:53:17.540 --> 00:53:19.860]   94
[00:53:19.860 --> 00:53:26.980]   Wow describe what the worldwide the picture phone equipment sales in 1994
[00:53:26.980 --> 00:53:30.100]   Are there are there is that millions after that number?
[00:53:30.420 --> 00:53:32.580]   No, that's just thousands
[00:53:32.580 --> 00:53:35.060]   Um
[00:53:35.060 --> 00:53:40.740]   Wow in 1994 group conferencing systems under well under 50,000
[00:53:40.740 --> 00:53:46.100]   Uh analog video phones actually i'm actually surprised to see that in 1994
[00:53:46.100 --> 00:53:48.740]   maybe 50,000
[00:53:48.740 --> 00:53:55.540]   There was actually a little bump in 93. That's probably because of AT&T pushing remember that stupid picture phone
[00:53:55.540 --> 00:53:57.860]   Yeah
[00:53:57.860 --> 00:53:59.620]   picture tell
[00:53:59.620 --> 00:54:04.740]   Sales of group video conferencing by the world's six largest manufacturers first half of 1994
[00:54:04.740 --> 00:54:07.220]   picture tell sold
[00:54:07.220 --> 00:54:09.620]   2,855
[00:54:09.620 --> 00:54:13.460]   Hitachi sold 315 not millions not thousands
[00:54:13.460 --> 00:54:17.780]   315 and they still had 5% of the market
[00:54:17.780 --> 00:54:20.820]   so clearly picture phones
[00:54:20.820 --> 00:54:25.060]   And but what is really hysterical about this is the projection
[00:54:25.060 --> 00:54:29.140]   They thought by 1999 there'd be half a million
[00:54:29.780 --> 00:54:31.780]   PC based video
[00:54:31.780 --> 00:54:38.260]   phones by 99 that might be true. I mean we had the zd tv net cam network remember we're handing out
[00:54:38.260 --> 00:54:40.740]   Picture phones to people around 98
[00:54:40.740 --> 00:54:44.660]   So that we could see you know, we called them, you know, what do we call them net cams?
[00:54:44.660 --> 00:54:47.300]   So we could see them they didn't work very well
[00:54:47.300 --> 00:54:50.900]   Anyway, we've come a long way since 1994
[00:54:50.900 --> 00:54:56.900]   So so benedict as this is one he you know sucks his thumb and comes up with smart things to say
[00:54:57.380 --> 00:55:00.580]   And he's trying to figure out what comes after a zoom and he looks at it and he said that
[00:55:00.580 --> 00:55:06.660]   You either had in in in these calls you either had to have something that was
[00:55:06.660 --> 00:55:10.980]   URL based or phone number based
[00:55:10.980 --> 00:55:14.180]   Right. Yeah, he said that's why that's why
[00:55:14.180 --> 00:55:17.140]   By google has to
[00:55:17.140 --> 00:55:19.700]   Meet is URL based duo is people based
[00:55:19.700 --> 00:55:25.060]   Okay, and zoom came along and they went one step further
[00:55:27.300 --> 00:55:31.460]   They took the friction out and you don't need an account an app or a social graph to use it
[00:55:31.460 --> 00:55:38.740]   Where zoom made network effects irrelevant, but says ben interesting that means zoom doesn't have those network effects either
[00:55:38.740 --> 00:55:41.140]   It grew by removing defensibility
[00:55:41.140 --> 00:55:46.820]   It's just a perfect ben evidence kind of analysis and thought off which I which I like
[00:55:46.820 --> 00:55:52.820]   Um, he's he and this explains a lot because and I even asked this question. Why not Skype?
[00:55:52.820 --> 00:55:54.500]   Why not?
[00:55:54.500 --> 00:56:00.180]   Any one of it does in other programs that were ever you know there before zoom even
[00:56:00.180 --> 00:56:04.020]   You had to have the app
[00:56:04.020 --> 00:56:06.260]   um and and it kind of
[00:56:06.260 --> 00:56:13.460]   It was in cold storage really in microsoft's hands. I think for a long time. Yeah, um, so so then he asked what comes next
[00:56:13.460 --> 00:56:16.020]   and he's just saying that
[00:56:16.020 --> 00:56:17.060]   um
[00:56:17.060 --> 00:56:19.060]   You know he goes he goes back to
[00:56:19.060 --> 00:56:23.780]   Is it dropbox the drew huge to them said when he started? Yeah, um
[00:56:24.180 --> 00:56:26.900]   Everybody said well, there's a there's a million of these things. He said yeah, do you use them?
[00:56:26.900 --> 00:56:31.140]   So, you know, he made the best thing and saying with skype there was there was VoIP
[00:56:31.140 --> 00:56:38.340]   But skype made it good. So now zoom comes along. What he thinks I think and I agree with this is what's the social purpose of it?
[00:56:38.340 --> 00:56:44.500]   They're not really asking why are you here? And what do you want to do? And there's a few new things coming out there more for events
[00:56:44.500 --> 00:56:51.940]   But I think that this whole notion of talking this way. I find a phone call now. So ever since the lockdown
[00:56:53.300 --> 00:56:56.420]   I'm phone call is just antiquated as hell to me. I feel old fashioned
[00:56:56.420 --> 00:57:01.620]   This is really scratchy. You feel like you're gonna grandma in 1932
[00:57:01.620 --> 00:57:05.140]   I'm missing some line. Am I doing this? I'm so zoom
[00:57:05.140 --> 00:57:11.220]   You know you like phone calls and are you a phone call guy? Oh, no, I hate to tell
[00:57:11.220 --> 00:57:14.020]   I can't stand a telephone
[00:57:14.020 --> 00:57:18.740]   but what I've been hearing since this this shelter-in-place stuff is people are
[00:57:19.700 --> 00:57:24.100]   appreciative of phone calls because it's been so much of a text culture, you know
[00:57:24.100 --> 00:57:30.100]   Yeah, but I think that that's been I mean honestly whenever possible. I do a video phone call. Yeah, I do too
[00:57:30.100 --> 00:57:32.580]   Yeah, there's that too
[00:57:32.580 --> 00:57:34.740]   but
[00:57:34.740 --> 00:57:39.780]   There are times when my phone will ring and I'm like what was that sound? Oh, it's a ringer
[00:57:39.780 --> 00:57:45.220]   Spam, that's what it is. That's part of the problem, right? Is the only people who use phones anymore are spammers
[00:57:45.540 --> 00:57:49.140]   Well, I have a call my mom on a phone call in many years
[00:57:49.140 --> 00:57:54.740]   But I FaceTime her and if I tried to phone call her she said no no where's the picture? I want FaceTime
[00:57:54.740 --> 00:57:58.180]   And she's saying and on the other hand with me
[00:57:58.180 --> 00:58:02.260]   We do hang out every now and then with my mother
[00:58:02.260 --> 00:58:05.380]   But most of the time it's it's just easier
[00:58:05.380 --> 00:58:11.460]   For me to do a phone call. I call my mom on a certain day of the week kind of thing and because I know
[00:58:12.020 --> 00:58:18.660]   She's going 200 mile an hour doing whatever it is she's doing and the last thing she wants to do is stare at the video chat
[00:58:18.660 --> 00:58:25.140]   You know, so really that's interesting. So she'll talk to you while she's doing other stuff. So that's why she prefers
[00:58:25.140 --> 00:58:27.540]   Oh, yeah, definitely
[00:58:27.540 --> 00:58:33.860]   Definitely. Yeah, you do have to I mean I've done with my mom. I uh phoned her up while i'm cooking you should try this
[00:58:33.860 --> 00:58:40.340]   Video call while we're cooking and put her there. So she's like she's she's like leaning on the counter while i'm cooking
[00:58:40.820 --> 00:58:46.260]   She loves that. All right, and I love that. I got stuff to do boy. Yeah
[00:58:46.260 --> 00:58:49.140]   She should put you on the counter while she's
[00:58:49.140 --> 00:58:54.580]   She's like I guess I still have to do I never heard of him saying what you gotta say mom's fried chicken
[00:58:54.580 --> 00:58:56.580]   I want some of that fried chicken
[00:58:56.580 --> 00:58:58.580]   She's famous for fried chicken
[00:58:58.580 --> 00:59:04.980]   Uh, I was just goes back to our first discussion too, which is which is what comes next so so Ben talks about snap
[00:59:04.980 --> 00:59:08.740]   And he said there were lots of ways that you can send images to people
[00:59:09.460 --> 00:59:14.020]   But snap wasn't one of the people that I said why do you press the camera button the app opens in the camera
[00:59:14.020 --> 00:59:18.420]   And why are you saving your messages? Isn't that like saving all your phone calls?
[00:59:18.420 --> 00:59:23.620]   Fundamentally snap asked why exactly are you saying the picture? Right? What's the underlying social purpose?
[00:59:23.620 --> 00:59:26.820]   You're not really setting someone a sheet of pixels you're communicating
[00:59:26.820 --> 00:59:32.820]   So I just think that I just I looked this up because it was remind us of our of our first conversation today
[00:59:32.820 --> 00:59:38.660]   Of their their baby steps towards something new that we hadn't thought of I still think that's out there
[00:59:38.660 --> 00:59:42.340]   I think it's still early days. We'll see it's so funny because
[00:59:42.340 --> 00:59:46.580]   The science fiction future was video calls
[00:59:46.580 --> 00:59:55.220]   Yeah, when a 2001 a space odyssey came out. I think it was 77. I remember going to the world's fair pretty close today
[00:59:55.220 --> 01:00:00.580]   In 64 right? Yeah, exactly. I was there. I mean so it was a little nipper. We were kids
[01:00:00.580 --> 01:00:05.300]   Uh, and we saw the first 18 t picture phone and we thought oh that's no future
[01:00:05.940 --> 01:00:10.820]   And it didn't happen and I thought it was and then I it was me in my big brain
[01:00:10.820 --> 01:00:14.020]   I'm thinking seriously about why and I thought well
[01:00:14.020 --> 01:00:18.260]   Nobody wants to be on camera because you'd have to put on clothes and makeup and right?
[01:00:18.260 --> 01:00:20.980]   It would just it's just so much easier to do voice only
[01:00:20.980 --> 01:00:23.780]   And I think that that was true until march
[01:00:23.780 --> 01:00:31.940]   I think it changed and I don't think we're gonna go back. I think we're all kind of used to seeing each other now
[01:00:31.940 --> 01:00:34.660]   Right
[01:00:34.660 --> 01:00:36.660]   Yeah, yeah, we are
[01:00:36.660 --> 01:00:41.860]   Um, yeah, and it's not that's we were dragging and into this future. He doesn't want to go
[01:00:41.860 --> 01:00:43.380]   It's because of mom
[01:00:43.380 --> 01:00:47.380]   I'm a tech sky, you know, just well I prefer text to honestly
[01:00:47.380 --> 01:00:52.500]   That's asynchronous you to it's not nearly as involving but you can't call you can't text your mother
[01:00:52.500 --> 01:00:57.700]   Oh, yes, we do all the time stay but you still have to make that she prefers text too
[01:00:57.700 --> 01:01:02.900]   I wish my mom did actually I text my mom a lot. We have lots of conversation. She prefers text too
[01:01:02.900 --> 01:01:05.620]   Mostly our conversations are face time
[01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:12.740]   Nothing not now honey nothing nothing. I just woke up. You want to face time? Nothing
[01:01:12.740 --> 01:01:19.060]   Nothing. Oh, I'm up now. You want to face time? Nothing nothing. I swear to god
[01:01:19.060 --> 01:01:22.980]   It's it's all about scheduling the face time call more than anything else
[01:01:22.980 --> 01:01:29.620]   But we do my mom stuff. She does not like the telephone, you know, because she's in in sales
[01:01:29.620 --> 01:01:33.700]   So she's always on the phone. Oh, that's why yeah, oh, that's different
[01:01:33.700 --> 01:01:39.940]   Yeah, I spent a lot of time in i2 support years and years ago. So I was always listening to you
[01:01:39.940 --> 01:01:42.740]   Oh, you probably have a nice headset
[01:01:42.740 --> 01:01:48.900]   No, because this is the hard thing for me is holding something to my ear
[01:01:48.900 --> 01:01:54.260]   For more than a minute or two. I just don't like it. Yeah after a while it gets tiring even with my biceps
[01:01:54.260 --> 01:01:56.660]   Give me a headset
[01:01:56.740 --> 01:01:58.740]   I will brag the heads
[01:01:58.740 --> 01:02:07.380]   I'm sorry, even with my biceps that could not have a five hundred pound phone and I wouldn't tire at all
[01:02:07.380 --> 01:02:10.100]   Even with my biceps and
[01:02:10.100 --> 01:02:18.260]   My little noodle arms even I can't hold the phone very long. It's not bragging if it's true. Damn it
[01:02:18.260 --> 01:02:21.540]   Um
[01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:27.300]   Yeah, I think a good headset does make a difference and it is true that with a picture phone you are tied down
[01:02:27.300 --> 01:02:29.540]   You have to be in front of that camera
[01:02:29.540 --> 01:02:32.660]   Although I will I'll pick it up and I'll go outside
[01:02:32.660 --> 01:02:40.260]   Mm-hmm. You know and the other thing that's really nice is if it's on your phone as opposed to your computer. You can show people stuff
[01:02:40.260 --> 01:02:42.340]   right
[01:02:42.340 --> 01:02:47.540]   And I and I've had moments of doing doing that with my family back east
[01:02:47.540 --> 01:02:49.380]   but
[01:02:49.380 --> 01:02:56.660]   Most of them they struggle with that stuff. They they can't see or their signals bad and it's just I gotta push what?
[01:02:56.660 --> 01:02:59.940]   That's annoying. Yeah, just let it go
[01:02:59.940 --> 01:03:06.260]   Well, we are in a new world so Benedict asks what's the next thing?
[01:03:06.260 --> 01:03:11.460]   Right he has done the answer. He said it's gonna be some somebody's gonna understand your purpose
[01:03:11.460 --> 01:03:14.340]   What's the snap or snapchat of
[01:03:16.420 --> 01:03:19.460]   What's Twitter Twitter? So that's backwards
[01:03:19.460 --> 01:03:24.740]   No Twitter Twitter would be the next steps instead. Don't argue. All right. I still haven't got that
[01:03:24.740 --> 01:03:30.420]   Yeah, and they got a lot of grief for being not accessible. Oh
[01:03:30.420 --> 01:03:33.780]   Um, it didn't come out with captioning
[01:03:33.780 --> 01:03:36.740]   Well, I was gonna say do you think that's like version 1.1?
[01:03:36.740 --> 01:03:40.900]   I mean, they had to try to say they probably would be smarter to say this is just a test
[01:03:40.900 --> 01:03:45.060]   We'll be adding captioning as soon as we can but let's see how people like it if you had an android phone
[01:03:45.060 --> 01:03:48.180]   It didn't capture it to would caption it automatically if you had an android phone
[01:03:48.180 --> 01:03:52.660]   I mean you've been you two struggled with that stuff in the beginning. It's just yeah
[01:03:52.660 --> 01:03:58.740]   It's a lot of work involved on it. Yep. Gotta be accessible though. Yeah, you gotta think about it
[01:03:58.740 --> 01:04:01.140]   You gotta at least pay attention to it
[01:04:01.140 --> 01:04:07.540]   I just saw somebody you know the sensitivity is is quite proper, you know, the disabled in the country
[01:04:07.540 --> 01:04:10.340]   um, so somebody there somebody put up
[01:04:10.340 --> 01:04:12.500]   a
[01:04:12.500 --> 01:04:15.060]   See I can use name Stephen spawn spo hn
[01:04:15.060 --> 01:04:16.500]   um
[01:04:16.500 --> 01:04:22.340]   So that the ada the americans disabilities act is designed for people like he is who have disabilities
[01:04:22.340 --> 01:04:29.620]   Um, but people are now making these cards claiming a disability for as as their legal rate not to wear a mask
[01:04:29.620 --> 01:04:36.260]   Oh boy, you almost cursed. I'm sorry. Yeah
[01:04:39.860 --> 01:04:42.580]   Good grief, man. Yeah. Yeah, it's not amazing
[01:04:42.580 --> 01:04:50.740]   It's a new world order. That's all it is. It's a it's a new world disorder and she's people don't care about each other
[01:04:50.740 --> 01:04:53.300]   Nope. Yeah
[01:04:53.300 --> 01:04:58.580]   Yeah, I got a uh, I got an email from a guy saying i'm an idiot free recommending masks. He says max don't work
[01:04:58.580 --> 01:05:04.420]   He said next time you think poorly of the guy next to you not wearing a mask. Maybe he's smarter than you
[01:05:04.420 --> 01:05:08.420]   Okay
[01:05:08.420 --> 01:05:12.180]   If you don't like masks, you're really gonna hate that ventilator when they put it later. I mean
[01:05:12.180 --> 01:05:16.100]   I mean mr. La Porte the mask has nothing to do with him being smarter
[01:05:16.100 --> 01:05:21.540]   I know I look dumber
[01:05:21.540 --> 01:05:25.940]   Pixel four a so conflicting stories
[01:05:25.940 --> 01:05:31.940]   The last rumor I heard was that the pixel four a which is the low priced version of google's flagship
[01:05:32.500 --> 01:05:38.980]   phone and by the way the three a people really loved although it turns out it did not sell as well as the three
[01:05:38.980 --> 01:05:41.060]   I thought I thought it did but it didn't
[01:05:41.060 --> 01:05:46.500]   I thought it did too. Really cheaper. Yeah, one would have thought maybe I misread that off to go back and look at those numbers
[01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:48.340]   for a we
[01:05:48.340 --> 01:05:52.980]   I think john prosser said it's not gonna be out till the fall google's now just putting it off putting off
[01:05:52.980 --> 01:05:59.140]   I think the plan had covid not intervened was to uh introduce it at google io last month
[01:06:00.100 --> 01:06:02.980]   It didn't happen in may didn't happen
[01:06:02.980 --> 01:06:07.380]   And well we're halfway through june. I'm a little more actually three quarters the way through june
[01:06:07.380 --> 01:06:16.020]   The rumor was july and then prosser said not till september now. We think it might be july again two different french retailers
[01:06:16.020 --> 01:06:19.060]   posted listings for
[01:06:19.060 --> 01:06:21.940]   pixel four a's
[01:06:21.940 --> 01:06:27.380]   uh or the media and a stock or a stock dot fr
[01:06:28.580 --> 01:06:34.740]   Choices of blue or black one storage option 128 gigabytes both retailers give a street date
[01:06:34.740 --> 01:06:39.060]   Of early july former says july seventh
[01:06:39.060 --> 01:06:43.300]   The latter says eight to 12 working days, which is roughly july seventh
[01:06:43.300 --> 01:06:48.020]   So again, I have to I guess tell people don't delay
[01:06:48.020 --> 01:06:53.460]   I mean do delay don't not what what do you want me to do?
[01:06:53.460 --> 01:06:57.780]   Don't not do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it if you don't
[01:06:58.580 --> 01:06:59.780]   If I
[01:06:59.780 --> 01:07:05.380]   Don't buy a pixel for today when you could buy a pixel for it. Don't not do that on tuesday
[01:07:05.380 --> 01:07:06.340]   Right
[01:07:06.340 --> 01:07:11.860]   Right, uh second tuesday of next week or something. Yes. I will gladly pay you tuesday
[01:07:11.860 --> 01:07:14.500]   For you. No, or a today
[01:07:14.500 --> 01:07:21.380]   Was that wimpy wimpy wimpy very good. I thought you'd be too young for that. I'm shocked
[01:07:21.380 --> 01:07:23.940]   I watched i watched
[01:07:25.380 --> 01:07:28.180]   This is the moment when stacy looks at us like we're both insane
[01:07:28.180 --> 01:07:30.740]   Yeah, and it calls us old somebody who's been around
[01:07:30.740 --> 01:07:33.540]   Is that where you got the inspiration for your biceps?
[01:07:33.540 --> 01:07:38.660]   You know, actually I understand actually it's because of ants exercise in his biceps
[01:07:38.660 --> 01:07:40.660]   He's actually 70 years old. He's spinning
[01:07:40.660 --> 01:07:46.820]   And he's a spinach but I it's my spinach the cook sir else finished
[01:07:46.820 --> 01:07:53.060]   Um, okay, there's uh, that's good. We got we got a lot of juice out of that week story
[01:07:54.100 --> 01:07:56.740]   For a versus the three xl
[01:07:56.740 --> 01:07:59.700]   Oh, that's a good question
[01:07:59.700 --> 01:08:02.100]   No, I don't want to get to a smaller phone. I like my excel
[01:08:02.100 --> 01:08:04.660]   Mm-hmm
[01:08:04.660 --> 01:08:06.660]   You have now wasn't the four
[01:08:06.660 --> 01:08:11.940]   In in everyone's hands last year around october except in november
[01:08:11.940 --> 01:08:17.220]   Seems like I remember the one that uncle leo got me
[01:08:17.220 --> 01:08:22.420]   Last year was the right around that time. Yeah, it was it was. I think you're right. Yeah
[01:08:22.980 --> 01:08:26.900]   They wait to the three a xl has a six inch screen. Yeah
[01:08:26.900 --> 01:08:35.220]   The four a is how big they don't they no one knows I think knows. Oh, it's not out. Yeah, 5.81
[01:08:35.220 --> 01:08:37.220]   Well here wait a minute. Here's a
[01:08:37.220 --> 01:08:40.180]   From android authority everything we know so far
[01:08:40.180 --> 01:08:43.220]   about the pixel for a
[01:08:43.220 --> 01:08:45.620]   Uh
[01:08:45.620 --> 01:08:48.100]   Name and release date
[01:08:48.100 --> 01:08:52.180]   Uh, I don't think we're gonna get all those three colors or those two colors. I don't know
[01:08:52.580 --> 01:08:56.340]   Oh the french French the french wall maybe the french won't
[01:08:56.340 --> 01:08:59.940]   Uh, does the same thing do I see here's the design?
[01:08:59.940 --> 01:09:02.580]   Uh
[01:09:02.580 --> 01:09:06.740]   It looks like a paired down pixel for in other words roughly the same
[01:09:06.740 --> 01:09:09.620]   size without the camera bump maybe
[01:09:09.620 --> 01:09:12.580]   Um
[01:09:12.580 --> 01:09:15.300]   Is it just less expensive for
[01:09:15.300 --> 01:09:19.380]   Probably the same size. I don't know
[01:09:20.740 --> 01:09:25.220]   Was the three eight the same size as it's 5.81 inches. Okay, so it's big
[01:09:25.220 --> 01:09:29.380]   Ooh, that's okay headphone jack headphone jack alert
[01:09:29.380 --> 01:09:35.700]   Wow, here's people here's a here's a spanish language youtube review of the pixel for a
[01:09:35.700 --> 01:09:37.380]   What no
[01:09:37.380 --> 01:09:42.660]   Come on man. Yes. Just like the last three phones from google
[01:09:42.660 --> 01:09:49.060]   So I do want to correct myself the three eight. I think did sell very well. In fact, arguably so better than the three
[01:09:49.700 --> 01:09:56.900]   That's what I thought last year. I was completely mistaken last year had record sales for the pixel 7.2
[01:09:56.900 --> 01:10:00.100]   Million the best year yet for the pixel line
[01:10:00.100 --> 01:10:03.060]   Uh, nothing like sam sanger apple, but still
[01:10:03.060 --> 01:10:08.660]   And according to android authority very likely the sales of the three a make up the bulk
[01:10:08.660 --> 01:10:14.980]   Of that 7.2 million units. So I apologize. I was still holding out for new chrome book
[01:10:14.980 --> 01:10:19.300]   I mean, I'm thinking about the ace or thinking about that. But the fan is throwing me off
[01:10:19.300 --> 01:10:26.180]   So I'm just hoping google isn't new one. I hope I call it nice. The ace from last year was very nice. So that's another good one
[01:10:26.180 --> 01:10:29.140]   You need you feel like you need power
[01:10:29.140 --> 01:10:35.860]   Right. Yeah. Yeah, no fans. No fans. Yeah, that's an interesting combination. Yeah
[01:10:35.860 --> 01:10:39.380]   So is is apple finally
[01:10:39.380 --> 01:10:42.180]   Go to get a touch screen. No
[01:10:42.980 --> 01:10:47.700]   Why would you say that they have a ipad? That's what you need because they're going to run apps on the no
[01:10:47.700 --> 01:10:51.060]   Well, no apparently they didn't mention that unknown
[01:10:51.060 --> 01:10:56.500]   But I think they're pretty dogmatic that that's what really distinguishes ultimately a
[01:10:56.500 --> 01:10:59.940]   iOS device and ipad OS device
[01:10:59.940 --> 01:11:02.580]   Is the touch screen
[01:11:02.580 --> 01:11:06.900]   I wrote when I returned my wife. I was going to do something on a machine. I I start reaching for the screen
[01:11:06.900 --> 01:11:10.100]   And realize no, I can't do that here
[01:11:11.380 --> 01:11:13.380]   Yeah, yeah, once you get used to it
[01:11:13.380 --> 01:11:18.580]   It is kind of like something you expect with computing device. Although yeah, I don't miss the screen
[01:11:18.580 --> 01:11:23.540]   I don't have a touch screen on most of my linux computers and I don't miss that. I can live without that
[01:11:23.540 --> 01:11:26.260]   Well, you're in your private old school guy though
[01:11:26.260 --> 01:11:29.300]   I am an old school man line. I know right
[01:11:29.300 --> 01:11:32.580]   So you never really think about touching the screen
[01:11:32.580 --> 01:11:37.620]   Second who needs your mouse. What is this? What is this thing? No stone? It just
[01:11:37.620 --> 01:11:40.420]   They brought these pointy things
[01:11:41.380 --> 01:11:42.420]   Uh
[01:11:42.420 --> 01:11:46.260]   Man lines all you need. I'm going to use pine for my email and be happy with it
[01:11:46.260 --> 01:11:48.980]   story in the daily beast
[01:11:48.980 --> 01:11:54.340]   About what uh our friend sergie brin has been up to since he retired. Oh
[01:11:54.340 --> 01:11:58.180]   He this is actually really cool. He runs a secret
[01:11:58.180 --> 01:12:01.780]   disaster relief squad called the global
[01:12:01.780 --> 01:12:07.940]   Support and development. It's made up of x military and brin's former bodyguards
[01:12:08.980 --> 01:12:13.300]   Entirely funded by brin to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars
[01:12:13.300 --> 01:12:15.940]   They swoop in
[01:12:15.940 --> 01:12:21.220]   When trouble strikes when her irk came dorian hit the bahamas last september
[01:12:21.220 --> 01:12:27.460]   Uh shortly after the storm died down long before bahamian government aid arrived
[01:12:27.460 --> 01:12:31.780]   Sergie brin arrived on a high speed super yacht
[01:12:31.780 --> 01:12:38.740]   Oh man. God. How did we not know that? Oh man access crew said to where clearing rose was saw chain sus
[01:12:39.220 --> 01:12:42.500]   So survivors could find their way to the team's medical staff
[01:12:42.500 --> 01:12:48.980]   Their doctor and paramedics triaged or treated nearly one in ten of the island's population
[01:12:48.980 --> 01:12:56.180]   Their marine specialists used sonar systems to survey the seafloor for hazards if this is a move isn't a movie
[01:12:56.180 --> 01:13:00.980]   I don't know what is while their aviation experts set up an air traffic control system
[01:13:00.980 --> 01:13:05.300]   At abaco's damaged airport
[01:13:07.220 --> 01:13:12.980]   Which allowed over 1100 this isn't a movie. This isn't a movie. This is a is a weekly series
[01:13:12.980 --> 01:13:21.380]   Oh my god, oh moment around the name, right the global support and development team as they sail their super yacht to trouble
[01:13:21.380 --> 01:13:26.100]   Exactly. It's a y e five all and the six million dollar man and
[01:13:26.100 --> 01:13:28.500]   Wonder woman
[01:13:28.500 --> 01:13:32.340]   And they've been doing this. I don't know what five years
[01:13:32.340 --> 01:13:34.500]   who knew
[01:13:34.500 --> 01:13:35.700]   and
[01:13:35.700 --> 01:13:40.740]   By the way, if you've been thinking you want to ride on the gigantic new airship
[01:13:40.740 --> 01:13:48.100]   Is just launched. Yeah. Yeah, please. You'll be glad to know employees get catered lunches free gyms and on-site massages
[01:13:48.100 --> 01:13:51.780]   Really? Yes, that's all
[01:13:51.780 --> 01:13:55.060]   Well, I think they get paid. I bet they get paid
[01:13:55.060 --> 01:13:58.020]   uh
[01:13:58.020 --> 01:14:00.020]   What the what?
[01:14:00.020 --> 01:14:03.940]   Dragonflies the name of this uh super yacht
[01:14:04.820 --> 01:14:08.340]   It's an 80 million dollar 15 cabin super yacht
[01:14:08.340 --> 01:14:12.340]   Uh that swoops in when trouble
[01:14:12.340 --> 01:14:15.460]   Arrives this is so wild
[01:14:15.460 --> 01:14:20.260]   Of course, you know if you're a billionaire and you're not doing stuff like this you're really missing the boat
[01:14:20.260 --> 01:14:25.140]   Here's your opportunity to become you know a movie superhero
[01:14:25.140 --> 01:14:34.260]   Dragonfly has a doctor and five paramedics on board. It actually started kind of impromptu
[01:14:35.220 --> 01:14:38.180]   in uh 2015 when still a cyclone Pam
[01:14:38.180 --> 01:14:40.900]   pounded vanuatu
[01:14:40.900 --> 01:14:43.060]   Dragonfly was nearby
[01:14:43.060 --> 01:14:47.380]   So sir. He said let's go on over and see what we could do to help out
[01:14:47.380 --> 01:14:51.620]   Um actually, I don't think sir. Gay was on there
[01:14:51.620 --> 01:14:54.580]   but his captain mike gregory
[01:14:54.580 --> 01:14:56.900]   uh
[01:14:56.900 --> 01:15:01.300]   Contacted sir gay said let's can we go over there and they they did
[01:15:03.140 --> 01:15:05.860]   He is seguebrin is the charity's soul donor
[01:15:05.860 --> 01:15:12.900]   They he grabbed a number of air force pair of rescue guys i've been affiliated with from the security world
[01:15:12.900 --> 01:15:15.860]   And a couple of cores been out of the navy seal teams
[01:15:15.860 --> 01:15:23.140]   Dawson said in his speech we rated every home depot and pharmacy we could find and on about 18 hours notice we launched
[01:15:23.140 --> 01:15:28.340]   Making landfall at remote islands north of vanuatu's capital port villa
[01:15:28.980 --> 01:15:35.140]   Dragonfly reportedly moved 62 metric tons of fresh water ashore treated over 250 patients
[01:15:35.140 --> 01:15:41.140]   Facilitated three medical evacuations and built shelters in multiple villages. What the hell
[01:15:41.140 --> 01:15:45.140]   This was five years ago. We didn't even know when other
[01:15:45.140 --> 01:15:47.780]   We not know this one other
[01:15:47.780 --> 01:15:52.100]   Started to arrive dawson's team patted themselves on the back and returned to the united states, but
[01:15:52.100 --> 01:15:57.460]   No rest for the weary about two weeks later a large earthquake hit cat mandu
[01:15:57.780 --> 01:16:03.620]   Dawson said he got a phone call from his boss circuit called me up and he said are you guys ready to go
[01:16:03.620 --> 01:16:06.260]   We're going to cat mandu
[01:16:06.260 --> 01:16:09.220]   in 2016 they responded to
[01:16:09.220 --> 01:16:13.300]   A powerful seven point earthquake in equator
[01:16:13.300 --> 01:16:15.940]   hurricane matthew in the bahamas
[01:16:15.940 --> 01:16:20.580]   hurricane erma in 2017 and the turks and kakos islands
[01:16:24.500 --> 01:16:31.220]   At the end of 2018 following deployments to a volcanic emergency in vanuatu a drone mission to hady and another storm in pacific
[01:16:31.220 --> 01:16:34.340]   Brynn finally set up gsd as a non-profit charity
[01:16:34.340 --> 01:16:39.380]   He has sole responsibility for the board of directors is the soul donor
[01:16:39.380 --> 01:16:46.260]   eric powell another of Brynn's former security staff was chosen chosen to join dawson as a director
[01:16:46.260 --> 01:16:52.660]   It now has 20 full-time staff most of whom have medical training another 100 contractors
[01:16:53.620 --> 01:17:01.060]   Dawson noted that special forces veterans. This is a story from the daily beast comprising about a quarter of gsd's workers are very good at living
[01:17:01.060 --> 01:17:02.740]   unsupported
[01:17:02.740 --> 01:17:05.140]   establishing communications and problem-solving
[01:17:05.140 --> 01:17:08.340]   And they have biceps like ants
[01:17:08.340 --> 01:17:12.580]   It's called i'm going to call it Brynn team six
[01:17:12.580 --> 01:17:15.380]   Let me get that tree out of the way for you
[01:17:15.380 --> 01:17:18.340]   Hold one minute
[01:17:18.340 --> 01:17:23.780]   Gsd declined to comment on the record for this story and attempts to reach Brynn personally were unsuccessful
[01:17:23.780 --> 01:17:28.260]   They're there so they're not even we don't want any coverage. We got nothing to say
[01:17:28.260 --> 01:17:31.140]   Wow
[01:17:31.140 --> 01:17:35.860]   You want i can see why people are mad of a mad at us for not talking about google something like this
[01:17:35.860 --> 01:17:38.100]   It's been out there for five years shame on us
[01:17:38.100 --> 01:17:46.020]   I don't even see a picture of the boat. I want to see women. Let me search
[01:17:46.660 --> 01:17:50.500]   It's probably I could google it super yacht dragonfly
[01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:53.220]   I want a picture. Oh
[01:17:53.220 --> 01:17:58.020]   It's what it's the world's fastest super yacht
[01:17:58.020 --> 01:18:01.300]   Is there a picture? Yeah
[01:18:01.300 --> 01:18:04.580]   And that's perdy that is 73 meters
[01:18:04.580 --> 01:18:08.660]   Oh wow
[01:18:08.660 --> 01:18:13.620]   Currently unavailable for hire, but it went at it at it some one time it was
[01:18:14.420 --> 01:18:17.940]   But it was $773,000 Australian a week
[01:18:17.940 --> 01:18:21.940]   Oh my gosh, that's perdy
[01:18:21.940 --> 01:18:26.580]   It's just a helicopter. I don't see a helicopter in the deck though. They need a helicopter in the deck
[01:18:26.580 --> 01:18:32.500]   Well, so good for Sergei right? Sergei always had that he always wanted to be iron man
[01:18:32.500 --> 01:18:35.460]   Yeah, he always wanted to clearly
[01:18:35.460 --> 01:18:41.700]   Wow, it was built so is he is he as he really left the company or does he still have a
[01:18:42.100 --> 01:18:45.380]   Play probably sailing around and dragon for a little while
[01:18:45.380 --> 01:18:52.740]   Let's see where dragonfly is now. I bet i'm wondering if there's any can he solve covid for us
[01:18:52.740 --> 01:18:55.540]   They're working on it apparently that's also part of the deal
[01:18:55.540 --> 01:18:58.740]   They're they're working on it. So
[01:18:58.740 --> 01:19:01.540]   I've been watching
[01:19:01.540 --> 01:19:03.540]   kind of resonates for me because I've been
[01:19:03.540 --> 01:19:07.140]   Binging the world's weirdest
[01:19:07.140 --> 01:19:11.940]   reality show called below decks. It's about the cabin
[01:19:11.940 --> 01:19:17.700]   the crew and the and the and the and the guests on a super yachts they ran at these super yachts
[01:19:17.700 --> 01:19:19.700]   and
[01:19:19.700 --> 01:19:25.380]   Shenanigans and sue, but I doubt there's shenanigans going on on dragonfly. This is a nice boat
[01:19:25.380 --> 01:19:28.180]   Man
[01:19:28.180 --> 01:19:31.700]   And you and I just love the idea that it's loaded with baby seals
[01:19:31.700 --> 01:19:36.580]   All these guys with beards sitting around and
[01:19:36.580 --> 01:19:40.100]   Yeah, I once lived on worms for four months
[01:19:40.980 --> 01:19:43.380]   Not bad not bad
[01:19:43.380 --> 01:19:46.420]   Little chewy
[01:19:46.420 --> 01:19:49.620]   Uh, wow, that's I
[01:19:49.620 --> 01:19:55.300]   I didn't even thank you karstered for finding this story. Did you find this karstered? That's just wild
[01:19:55.300 --> 01:20:00.260]   Or was it the chatroom? I never even heard about that. I
[01:20:00.260 --> 01:20:06.020]   Was wait gonna ask him it was april. Yeah, it sounds like it was like one of them. Hey, let's take a break
[01:20:06.020 --> 01:20:09.220]   We got more nothing as good as that though, frankly, you should just
[01:20:09.860 --> 01:20:13.460]   Give up now. I found something in my archives that you'll enjoy even better
[01:20:13.460 --> 01:20:20.100]   And add something something you can wait for it's your turn to pick something at okay coming up
[01:20:20.100 --> 01:20:26.740]   First a word from last pass. We here we are in the beautiful last pass studios. Thank you last pass
[01:20:26.740 --> 01:20:31.460]   Frankly, I I think we owe a lot to last pass for being on the air this year
[01:20:31.460 --> 01:20:36.980]   They really have been great supporters. We've done a couple of last pass events and other ones coming up in the fall
[01:20:37.060 --> 01:20:39.060]   Not sure yet. We don't know how that's gonna
[01:20:39.060 --> 01:20:45.140]   Turn out it'll probably be virtual and we have some ideas for what we might do last pass
[01:20:45.140 --> 01:20:47.940]   You've heard me talk about for years literally at 10 years now
[01:20:47.940 --> 01:20:53.060]   Because it was I discovered it was my password manager for all that time. It's where I
[01:20:53.060 --> 01:21:00.260]   Store passwords and the reason you need a password manager is because if you reuse passwords or you use easy to guess passwords
[01:21:00.260 --> 01:21:02.420]   You're gonna get hacked. You're just gonna get hacked
[01:21:03.220 --> 01:21:09.060]   But last pass generates long strong completely unmemorable passwords and then stores them securely for you
[01:21:09.060 --> 01:21:16.100]   So they're always available it auto fills it works on android iOS Mac windows Linux on every browser known
[01:21:16.100 --> 01:21:19.860]   You go to a site it fills in the password for you. It's awesome
[01:21:19.860 --> 01:21:22.980]   But you should know a few things about last pass for instance
[01:21:22.980 --> 01:21:27.460]   They don't know the password only you can decrypt your password vault
[01:21:27.460 --> 01:21:31.780]   And it's only decrypted on your devices before it's sent up to last pass
[01:21:31.860 --> 01:21:36.740]   So there can be sent to all your devices. It's encrypted and sent up there. They don't have access to it
[01:21:36.740 --> 01:21:43.140]   They don't have the password only you do that's really important. They're using AES 256 the strongest encryption made
[01:21:43.140 --> 01:21:46.100]   To make sure that your stuff is completely safe
[01:21:46.100 --> 01:21:54.020]   It is it is best practices all around and they didn't just rest they could have being the best password manager in the world
[01:21:54.020 --> 01:21:56.260]   But they didn't rest on their laurels
[01:21:56.580 --> 01:22:01.780]   Now last pass enterprise does even more to make it easier for your employees and more secure for you
[01:22:01.780 --> 01:22:05.780]   Even if your employees are working out of the house and a lot of them are now
[01:22:05.780 --> 01:22:09.060]   They're not here at the office anymore. They're not protected by it
[01:22:09.060 --> 01:22:12.740]   Last pass if you're not using it don't worry it can be deployed quickly
[01:22:12.740 --> 01:22:19.300]   In the midst of any crisis to ensure your business keeps running smoothly every employee login is secure
[01:22:19.300 --> 01:22:24.900]   They of course have the password management, but there's more single sign on 1200 plus single sign on apps
[01:22:25.300 --> 01:22:29.460]   That means you just say yes on your phone and you're in that's more secure and more convenient
[01:22:29.460 --> 01:22:32.900]   I always thought you couldn't have both, but you can with last pass
[01:22:32.900 --> 01:22:38.100]   And it always has insight into who has access to what and where they're calling from that's important
[01:22:38.100 --> 01:22:42.340]   They've added multi-factor authentication not just biometrics like fingerprint or face
[01:22:42.340 --> 01:22:47.940]   They also use contextual factors things like your geolocation and ip address to make sure
[01:22:47.940 --> 01:22:51.140]   that whoever's using your bank accounts and your
[01:22:51.780 --> 01:22:56.340]   basis and your your servers and your websites, that's those are the people that ought to be and no one else
[01:22:56.340 --> 01:23:01.860]   They even make it better for employees because it's easier to share passwords if you have employees working from home
[01:23:01.860 --> 01:23:06.580]   They have other employees who need access to a resource. They can share it securely in last pass
[01:23:06.580 --> 01:23:11.380]   You don't have to do a post-it note or phone call. It's it's just taken care of last pass protects
[01:23:11.380 --> 01:23:15.300]   while providing a seamless workflow for your employees and
[01:23:16.020 --> 01:23:21.780]   Complete oversight of shadow it and enforceable policies for your it department you get the best of both worlds
[01:23:21.780 --> 01:23:24.180]   Whether it's password management single sign on
[01:23:24.180 --> 01:23:30.180]   Multi-factor authentication last pass enterprise is right for every business. We use it a twit
[01:23:30.180 --> 01:23:33.460]   So glad we are now that our employees are using it at home

[01:23:49.220 --> 01:23:50.980]   aunt
[01:23:50.980 --> 01:23:52.980]   What should we talk about?
[01:23:52.980 --> 01:23:56.340]   Amazon's two billion dollar climate change fund
[01:23:56.340 --> 01:24:00.820]   Oh
[01:24:00.820 --> 01:24:02.820]   Amazon's killing another uh
[01:24:02.820 --> 01:24:04.740]   Device
[01:24:04.740 --> 01:24:11.060]   Remember they uh, they killed the look that Denise howl uses to take pictures of every outfit she wears every day
[01:24:11.460 --> 01:24:16.260]   I have this the dash they killed the uh, they killed the the dash things themselves, right?
[01:24:16.260 --> 01:24:20.180]   Yeah, the dash buttons are gone, but this was the dash one you could scan
[01:24:20.180 --> 01:24:22.500]   How often did you use it later?
[01:24:22.500 --> 01:24:26.180]   It's had it's actually magnetically glued to my microwave. It's never been down
[01:24:26.180 --> 01:24:32.260]   It was it was expensive and it didn't do anything and had the little speaker in it you would scan something was like
[01:24:32.260 --> 01:24:36.420]   completely
[01:24:40.820 --> 01:24:44.900]   That's a player. Thank you. It was literally sounded just like that
[01:24:44.900 --> 01:24:51.380]   I'll bring it in because it's not gonna work in about
[01:24:51.380 --> 01:24:56.340]   A month to my 20 minutes did it went up a new wish never seen one of those
[01:24:56.340 --> 01:25:03.220]   It sounds like it sneezed into your speaking. It was the word. It was like a speaker this big
[01:25:06.500 --> 01:25:12.100]   Even know what it said it was the it was the qcat of commerce. It was the qcat
[01:25:12.100 --> 01:25:18.420]   Nobody's gonna gonna take a picture of this can or type this head or search for this. We're gonna let them scan it
[01:25:18.420 --> 01:25:22.740]   It was the qcat. Oh god. I can't believe I bought you know
[01:25:22.740 --> 01:25:27.380]   I bought a lot of crap. That's why aunt you know about it. I have my
[01:25:27.380 --> 01:25:33.220]   This is gonna go in leo's garage sale next time. I look forward to the garage sale
[01:25:34.900 --> 01:25:41.620]   Every six months I pile all the crap that I impulsively and stupidly bought for the last six months on a conference room table
[01:25:41.620 --> 01:25:47.940]   And all the employees come in and go through it. The thing is this stuff is getting better and better over it. It is it's true
[01:25:47.940 --> 01:25:50.980]   Not this dash wand
[01:25:50.980 --> 01:26:02.900]   It's really it wasn't was it bang in the dash one
[01:26:04.100 --> 01:26:07.860]   It was just it was such a little speaker you knew it was saying something
[01:26:07.860 --> 01:26:11.220]   But you didn't know what and it had no screen
[01:26:11.220 --> 01:26:14.340]   So you didn't know what the hell was happening
[01:26:14.340 --> 01:26:17.620]   Scan some of it
[01:26:17.620 --> 01:26:18.660]   Or is turned
[01:26:18.660 --> 01:26:20.660]   It would say something
[01:26:20.660 --> 01:26:24.500]   And then you didn't know and then it's the in theory it would order more than Amazon
[01:26:24.500 --> 01:26:30.260]   But you I never really trusted it because I would go ahead and just order it or would end up your car. I would order it
[01:26:32.020 --> 01:26:34.020]   How would it know how many you wanted?
[01:26:34.020 --> 01:26:41.620]   Honestly, I never used it. I tried it a few times like I don't get what's going on out here
[01:26:41.620 --> 01:26:47.060]   I don't want it, but it had a nice little magnetic mount. So it's sitting there right on the oh man
[01:26:47.060 --> 01:26:55.380]   So stupid what's wrong with me? Um, there is a room my story. Huh? My story is your story
[01:26:55.380 --> 01:26:58.340]   56 that's on 56 line 56
[01:26:58.340 --> 01:27:02.740]   Copy 56 your pizzas ready
[01:27:02.740 --> 01:27:09.540]   Amazon it's funny that you said that because that's exactly the next story. I was gonna mention I thought that was a really interesting one
[01:27:09.540 --> 01:27:16.580]   Oh, yeah, it has the wrong uh URL here. Oh it does. I'm sorry. It's my fault. Oh hell amazon prime rumored
[01:27:16.580 --> 01:27:19.540]   Amazon prime is gonna be
[01:27:20.260 --> 01:27:25.780]   Checking in to live tv that I use uh, I have to say I like it a lot
[01:27:25.780 --> 01:27:28.420]   the google
[01:27:28.420 --> 01:27:34.420]   YouTube live it's a real I think it's the best of the over the top line I've put a new new one in there
[01:27:34.420 --> 01:27:39.300]   Yeah, I got it. Yeah, I use youtube live as well. Um, I was on hulu
[01:27:39.300 --> 01:27:45.300]   But um hulu jacked up his prices. Yeah, so I went to youtube when it was a little bit cheaper
[01:27:45.300 --> 01:27:49.780]   And it's still fine. Although if everybody uses his 50 bucks now
[01:27:49.780 --> 01:27:51.780]   Which is annoying
[01:27:51.780 --> 01:27:57.940]   But I yeah the vcr is really uh easy to vcr. Sorry. Did you just say vcr?
[01:27:57.940 --> 01:28:03.780]   The dvr is really tell us more grandpa tell us more
[01:28:03.780 --> 01:28:06.500]   Do is put in a tape
[01:28:06.500 --> 01:28:10.660]   Be careful. No about those labels. They can come up to work. Shift. They peel off
[01:28:10.660 --> 01:28:19.540]   Uh according to protocol. How do you get this 12 to stop flash? No, that's part of it. It's oh, it's just flash
[01:28:19.700 --> 01:28:21.700]   And to let you know it's there
[01:28:21.700 --> 01:28:24.180]   It's always midnight in vcr land
[01:28:24.180 --> 01:28:28.980]   According to protocol, uh, this isn't really much of a story
[01:28:28.980 --> 01:28:35.380]   The company has posted on this thing. It's it's a it's a right. It's they're trying to hire people to help them do this
[01:28:35.380 --> 01:28:38.820]   I thought it would piss you off because you always wanted your live
[01:28:38.820 --> 01:28:41.540]   Everyday daily show and now are they gonna do it?
[01:28:41.540 --> 01:28:43.780]   never
[01:28:43.780 --> 01:28:45.780]   I could do such great comedy bits as
[01:28:45.780 --> 01:28:48.900]   Jesus
[01:28:48.900 --> 01:28:50.900]   I
[01:28:50.900 --> 01:28:58.180]   Have no problem with amazon getting into this space because it's more competition and
[01:28:58.180 --> 01:29:01.460]   Probably a lesser price for the consumer
[01:29:01.460 --> 01:29:06.420]   Uh, at least that's what I was told gotta be the beginning of the end. I mean the beginning
[01:29:06.420 --> 01:29:08.180]   It's the middle of the end
[01:29:08.180 --> 01:29:13.300]   For cable companies, right? What are they got that we need linear television? Yeah, yeah linear
[01:29:13.300 --> 01:29:16.180]   That's what you call it on but but but then again, everybody
[01:29:16.180 --> 01:29:20.020]   It's like it's like newspapers everybody thinks they gotta have a paywall now. They all deserve a paywall
[01:29:20.020 --> 01:29:24.020]   Now everybody thinks they gotta have a streaming channel, right? So nbc has peacock
[01:29:24.020 --> 01:29:28.740]   Right. I'm not I'm not subscribing to peacock. I'm not subscribing to your channel cbs
[01:29:28.740 --> 01:29:30.660]   The cbs
[01:29:30.660 --> 01:29:36.660]   Well, that's where the company like google and amazon may have an advantage because instead of buying a single companies
[01:29:36.660 --> 01:29:38.660]   Offerings
[01:29:38.660 --> 01:29:42.740]   It's a mall right so youtube tv or amazon prime tv
[01:29:43.380 --> 01:29:48.900]   You pay one fee and now you get all the locals you get i'm with you special channels
[01:29:48.900 --> 01:29:54.740]   Yeah, youtube tv's good what would be what what I would love is that there's some competition because youtube tv's raised its prices
[01:29:54.740 --> 01:30:01.140]   They're now $50 a month. Yeah, it's a k that's now a cable bill almost it is when you add the internet it is a cable bill
[01:30:01.140 --> 01:30:07.780]   You know and it becomes the episode episode both these systems the mso. Yeah, that's what's the new mso
[01:30:07.780 --> 01:30:10.100]   That's the cable lost its most ownness. Yeah
[01:30:11.380 --> 01:30:15.860]   Well, but I like the idea of having everything in one spot if it's even if it's amazon
[01:30:15.860 --> 01:30:20.180]   Because I watch a lot of amazon original content. I watch a lot of amazon prime
[01:30:20.180 --> 01:30:26.180]   Offer content and now you can give me some good old live sports potentially
[01:30:26.180 --> 01:30:28.900]   some yeah
[01:30:28.900 --> 01:30:30.740]   From the good old
[01:30:30.740 --> 01:30:34.420]   Fresno be the best named newspaper in the world
[01:30:34.420 --> 01:30:40.100]   This is I just found this one. This was incredible comes the news remember devan noonus
[01:30:40.740 --> 01:30:42.740]   who could forget
[01:30:42.740 --> 01:30:44.900]   member of congress
[01:30:44.900 --> 01:30:47.060]   was he the
[01:30:47.060 --> 01:30:50.100]   He was the uh, what's the opposite of the challenge committee?
[01:30:50.100 --> 01:30:54.580]   Yeah, but he wasn't the chair because it was a congress so it was you what he was before
[01:30:54.580 --> 01:30:59.380]   What's the democrats was in 18? Yeah, so he was the other is the ranking now. He's the ranking
[01:30:59.380 --> 01:31:03.300]   That's the word I was looking for the ranking member of this in the house intelligence committee
[01:31:03.300 --> 01:31:06.500]   Uh, he was upset because there's a twitter account
[01:31:06.500 --> 01:31:09.140]   devan noonus cow
[01:31:10.260 --> 01:31:12.260]   There's also devan noonus mom
[01:31:12.260 --> 01:31:16.500]   as far as we know neither the cow nor the mom run their own accounts
[01:31:16.500 --> 01:31:18.580]   Uh
[01:31:18.580 --> 01:31:24.420]   Devan and his cow hanging out on the dairy in Iowa looking for the little trees in his cowpoke
[01:31:24.420 --> 01:31:27.140]   I don't even think that's very funny
[01:31:27.140 --> 01:31:32.260]   But anyway, uh devan wasn't happy about it sued. He's a
[01:31:32.260 --> 01:31:35.060]   I think he's a little litigious
[01:31:35.060 --> 01:31:39.620]   Oh, yeah, he seems to be careful what you're saying. Yeah, he seems to go to corn a lot anyway
[01:31:40.420 --> 01:31:40.980]   Um
[01:31:40.980 --> 01:31:44.500]   Twitter he sued twitter of being negligent for allowing
[01:31:44.500 --> 01:31:49.300]   Devan noonus cow to tweet
[01:31:49.300 --> 01:31:55.780]   Uh, he also, uh, didn't like devan noonus mom, but he also didn't like real life strategist liz mare
[01:31:55.780 --> 01:32:00.180]   And said all three had defamed him online rude his reputation
[01:32:00.180 --> 01:32:07.220]   And causing him to win his election in 2018 by less than he deserved
[01:32:08.260 --> 01:32:09.700]   wow
[01:32:09.700 --> 01:32:15.460]   Uh twitter's lawyers said twitter is immune from the lawsuit to do section 230
[01:32:15.460 --> 01:32:19.140]   As long as we have it
[01:32:19.140 --> 01:32:26.180]   Protected them the world buses it on the only exception is if twitter personally helped to develop or create the content
[01:32:26.180 --> 01:32:28.820]   Both sides stipulated they did not
[01:32:28.820 --> 01:32:32.820]   Um judge the judge in the case
[01:32:32.820 --> 01:32:35.700]   Uh john marshall
[01:32:36.260 --> 01:32:41.380]   Ruled friday twitter is immune from the defamation claims of devan noonus due to
[01:32:41.380 --> 01:32:47.140]   Federal law that says social media companies are not liable for what people post on that platform
[01:32:47.140 --> 01:32:49.140]   So what's the name of that law?
[01:32:49.140 --> 01:32:53.620]   section 230 so we got a couple of 230 related i always say
[01:32:53.620 --> 01:32:56.260]   213
[01:32:56.260 --> 01:32:57.780]   230
[01:32:57.780 --> 01:33:00.660]   230 of 230 a the communications
[01:33:00.660 --> 01:33:03.460]   26 words that created the internet decency act
[01:33:03.460 --> 01:33:07.620]   There's another two things story. Yeah, because there's a few mike baznik
[01:33:07.620 --> 01:33:11.460]   Yep, now has a twitter account. He sends people to for bad
[01:33:11.460 --> 01:33:19.540]   230 takes last week. We had the bad 230 take uh twitter account now mike baznik is going to send everyone who was a bad 230
[01:33:19.540 --> 01:33:26.020]   Um, let's take out a link. Um, well if you it's don't it's down under other no, it's under government
[01:33:26.020 --> 01:33:27.540]   Government
[01:33:27.540 --> 01:33:34.100]   Mike baznik responds to bad 230 takes we love mike. We've talked about him a lot. He's a client the guy is correct dirt
[01:33:34.100 --> 01:33:37.140]   Hello, you've been referred here because you're
[01:33:37.140 --> 01:33:42.180]   Because you're wrong about section 230, you know, that's really good because
[01:33:42.180 --> 01:33:45.380]   Uh mike has written so many pieces
[01:33:45.380 --> 01:33:52.100]   Saying even mainstream media gets 230 wrong. I know i've new times has gotten miserable wrong
[01:33:52.100 --> 01:33:54.980]   so uh
[01:33:54.980 --> 01:33:57.940]   He's written a post that explains
[01:33:57.940 --> 01:34:02.660]   I apologize if it feels a bit cold and rude to respond in such an impersonal way
[01:34:02.660 --> 01:34:08.660]   But i've been wasting a lot of time lately responding individually to different people saying the same wrong things over and over again
[01:34:08.660 --> 01:34:13.620]   Exactly if you said quote once a company like that starts moderating content
[01:34:13.620 --> 01:34:18.180]   It's no longer a platform, but a publisher. I regret to for inform you you're wrong
[01:34:18.180 --> 01:34:22.260]   You're wrong. The law says no such thing
[01:34:22.660 --> 01:34:28.340]   If you said because of section 230 websites have no incentive to moderate you are wrong
[01:34:28.340 --> 01:34:30.660]   You are wrong
[01:34:30.660 --> 01:34:37.220]   Greatest so this is good. So you can actually i'd be nice if you could refer them specifically to the section of this blog post
[01:34:37.220 --> 01:34:46.260]   Section 230 is a massive gift to big tech once again. I must inform you you are very very wrong
[01:34:46.260 --> 01:34:50.260]   If you and that's true because 230 protects me
[01:34:51.060 --> 01:34:53.540]   As well as exactly right every publisher out there. Yeah
[01:34:53.540 --> 01:35:02.340]   So this is good. He's got all of the straw men that even responsible publications like the new york times
[01:35:02.340 --> 01:35:05.460]   Probably inadvertently throw up
[01:35:05.460 --> 01:35:11.460]   About 230 he just knocks him down one by so so with jeff kossup who's brilliant
[01:35:11.460 --> 01:35:14.660]   And he wrote the book on 230 the 26 words of creative internet there
[01:35:15.060 --> 01:35:22.580]   He and mike were in a little conversation about what comes next and i said jokingly a board game and maznik said
[01:35:22.580 --> 01:35:25.220]   I actually have been working on that it was supposed to come out in april
[01:35:25.220 --> 01:35:32.020]   But the pandemic got in the way. Oh, that's good. We could have a first amendment and section 230 board game
[01:35:32.020 --> 01:35:36.580]   So the other thing that's related i want to plug something here if i may be so bold
[01:35:36.580 --> 01:35:38.100]   um
[01:35:38.100 --> 01:35:41.220]   I mentioned over time that i've been on a um
[01:35:42.660 --> 01:35:46.820]   Big breath transatlantic high-level working group on content moderation freedom of expression
[01:35:46.820 --> 01:35:49.620]   Wow put that in my it's lower third too. I will
[01:35:49.620 --> 01:35:52.340]   Yes
[01:35:52.340 --> 01:35:54.340]   So we catch came out of the report
[01:35:54.340 --> 01:35:58.420]   And under government, it's the first link is the report so i'd like to sign people to that
[01:35:58.420 --> 01:36:01.460]   it recommends a flexible framework for
[01:36:01.460 --> 01:36:06.900]   Content moderation discussion that the issue really is transparency and accountability
[01:36:06.900 --> 01:36:11.460]   That rather than having something like the netzd g law which is the hate speech law in germany
[01:36:11.460 --> 01:36:13.460]   That all everybody's was taking everything down within 24 hours
[01:36:13.460 --> 01:36:20.260]   Uh a version of that law was passed in france and then just failed in the constitutional court and was struck down
[01:36:20.260 --> 01:36:22.580]   Because it's a chill on free on speech
[01:36:22.580 --> 01:36:26.900]   The regulation so far as i'm a good so what this says instead is that each platform should should make
[01:36:26.900 --> 01:36:33.620]   A makes a promise of what it's going to do and then it's held to account for that and to do that
[01:36:33.620 --> 01:36:35.620]   We've got to get data out of them
[01:36:36.020 --> 01:36:38.020]   to regulators and researchers
[01:36:38.020 --> 01:36:44.180]   It also proposes an e-court for matters of legality so it's not handled in companies which is part of the french problem
[01:36:44.180 --> 01:36:47.780]   But instead handled there and it proposes
[01:36:47.780 --> 01:36:52.660]   Social media councils to be able to have an open discussion and a flexible framework
[01:36:52.660 --> 01:36:56.980]   So it's a good report. I get allergic. I get hives when it comes to regulating the internet
[01:36:56.980 --> 01:37:01.220]   I went into this process thinking this is going to drive me crazy. I'm going to jump off a boat
[01:37:01.220 --> 01:37:05.700]   But i'm impressed susan s former commissioner of the fcc put it together
[01:37:06.020 --> 01:37:10.020]   And I just wanted to plug that and then I also we presented it with the aspen institute
[01:37:10.020 --> 01:37:14.260]   On tuesday so right below that is a video which will be in the rundown folks
[01:37:14.260 --> 01:37:20.340]   Of the discussion that four of us from the group had with various people
[01:37:20.340 --> 01:37:25.620]   So I just wanted to throw that out because we're trying to even i who seems to be
[01:37:25.620 --> 01:37:31.860]   Libertarian and against um internet regulation find a structure here that I think can work
[01:37:31.860 --> 01:37:34.420]   This is all end of blood
[01:37:34.820 --> 01:37:35.860]   public
[01:37:35.860 --> 01:37:37.860]   policy center.org
[01:37:37.860 --> 01:37:42.580]   um, and now it's obviously not binding what do you think the
[01:37:42.580 --> 01:37:46.020]   Is the proposal be a proposal to?
[01:37:46.020 --> 01:37:54.020]   This is a proposal to governments to stop doing dumb laws like nesty g and french hate speed law and french fake news law
[01:37:54.020 --> 01:37:59.940]   And so we have uh, we've we've talked we've had sessions with with the major platforms
[01:37:59.940 --> 01:38:02.580]   We have sessions started with
[01:38:03.060 --> 01:38:07.460]   government regulatory regulators and we'll talk to them so the group includes
[01:38:07.460 --> 01:38:09.140]   um
[01:38:09.140 --> 01:38:13.300]   Some heavyweights. Oh, yeah, the name not being impressive. Yeah, there's a lot of names there
[01:38:13.300 --> 01:38:19.060]   So the four pillars of this framework for better internet trust in the information ecosystem
[01:38:19.060 --> 01:38:22.580]   Open and inclusive governance of social media
[01:38:22.580 --> 01:38:29.060]   Enhanced accountability of social media and legally enforced transparency rules. I like that
[01:38:30.020 --> 01:38:34.980]   And holding on to freedom of expression and human rights. Yeah, so just that's the end of my blog folks
[01:38:34.980 --> 01:38:38.580]   But I wanted to get that in because it's trying to make the internet better. It's trying to worry about this
[01:38:38.580 --> 01:38:43.860]   It's trying to find a path. It's interesting because you've really seems looks like social media is the
[01:38:43.860 --> 01:38:48.980]   Bulk of what you're talking about. Yeah. Yeah, because it's content moderation
[01:38:48.980 --> 01:38:53.300]   And and that's really what it comes down to so what are your rights in that case?
[01:38:53.300 --> 01:38:57.780]   Uh, you know, let's be back to mike bazdex post. No, the first amendment does not cover
[01:38:58.500 --> 01:39:03.140]   Does not give you rights when it comes to the platform as the platform is have a first amendment right to take down your stupid post
[01:39:03.140 --> 01:39:05.540]   We wish facebook would take down more of them
[01:39:05.540 --> 01:39:07.380]   But um
[01:39:07.380 --> 01:39:12.340]   But that's their right not to as well and leave it up if they want to that's their first amendment right
[01:39:12.340 --> 01:39:16.820]   The government only comes into this when it comes to the government trying to make something happen
[01:39:16.820 --> 01:39:20.100]   What's the response from uh governments? Uh any interest?
[01:39:20.100 --> 01:39:25.220]   Um, yeah, I think some whether you know one one member of parliament from the uk is on the group
[01:39:25.220 --> 01:39:26.740]   um
[01:39:26.740 --> 01:39:30.260]   Michael churthoff is on the group former head of uh holland security
[01:39:30.260 --> 01:39:31.860]   um
[01:39:31.860 --> 01:39:36.820]   uh, the former president of uh estonia tomos el vez is in the group
[01:39:36.820 --> 01:39:39.460]   How hard was it to reach consensus?
[01:39:39.460 --> 01:39:44.100]   It actually wasn't that hard. It was it was brilliantly run by susan s that
[01:39:44.100 --> 01:39:48.100]   Uh, she had had papers written so there was something like people did a paper about
[01:39:48.100 --> 01:39:54.820]   That's gg and what's wrong with it what it's trying to do and so on so what's there about a dozen of those papers that inform the discussion
[01:39:55.220 --> 01:39:59.860]   We met in nice places. We met in ditchely in the united kingdom. You're oxford
[01:39:59.860 --> 01:40:06.180]   We met in uh, Santa Monica and we met in belagio in italy. That was nice. That was good
[01:40:06.180 --> 01:40:14.500]   and then um, so it helps when you have good pasta and wine you come to a lot more agreement. I think that's true and um
[01:40:14.500 --> 01:40:21.540]   Uh, so uh, no wait it it i thought was gonna be rough, but no we actually got somewhere
[01:40:21.540 --> 01:40:24.580]   We really did i think it's possible to have a belief that
[01:40:25.220 --> 01:40:31.140]   Again the platforms um, we can uphold freedom of expression. We can uphold for human rights and the right to express
[01:40:31.140 --> 01:40:34.260]   The platforms need to find a level of responsibility
[01:40:34.260 --> 01:40:37.380]   Whatever that level is they need to be held accountable for it
[01:40:37.380 --> 01:40:41.780]   And the platform should not be making decisions about legality
[01:40:41.780 --> 01:40:48.020]   Uh, that is the job of government through courts so that we do this with due process in the open
[01:40:48.020 --> 01:40:54.100]   That's good. That's our view. That's good. That seems very sensible. Thanks to the university of pennsylvania for
[01:40:54.580 --> 01:40:59.220]   And the anenberg center for for doing that. Uh, that sounds like kathleen hall jameson
[01:40:59.220 --> 01:41:04.580]   Uh, thank you very much for uh making this happen. Well, so thank you for that. Thank you for doing it
[01:41:04.580 --> 01:41:06.660]   So now i'm gonna give you something more fun
[01:41:06.660 --> 01:41:11.860]   So if i may may i you may anti-searst all right

[01:41:17.380 --> 01:41:20.100]   Said that i had called
[01:41:20.100 --> 01:41:23.220]   Uh in a review as a former tv guide critic here
[01:41:23.940 --> 01:41:26.500]   I had uh reviewed deep space nine
[01:41:26.500 --> 01:41:29.700]   In 1993
[01:41:29.700 --> 01:41:35.300]   And that I had said and I didn't believe this so I went through my files and found the review
[01:41:35.300 --> 01:41:43.620]   This is the quote. Armin shiverman has a wonderfully rodent equality as quark the casino owner the donald trump of deep space
[01:41:43.620 --> 01:41:45.700]   Oh my god

[01:41:49.940 --> 01:41:56.580]   David black uh took that and put crumbs face in the right color onto quark
[01:41:56.580 --> 01:41:59.460]   In the tweet at a breath

[01:42:11.380 --> 01:42:16.180]   Take space nine or you're not a deep space guy. Okay. Okay, sorry. I'm gonna find that. I thought it was good review
[01:42:16.180 --> 01:42:18.980]   Is the tweet is the tweet linked here on this on the run down?
[01:42:18.980 --> 01:42:23.940]   It's right there. Yeah, if you go it's below it's below the review. Okay, the closest i can give you to
[01:42:23.940 --> 01:42:32.180]   Deep space nine as I do note that some folks refer to it as ds nine. Yes delta cira. Excellent. You're exactly right
[01:42:32.180 --> 01:42:34.820]   All right, so

[01:42:37.140 --> 01:42:41.620]   And I what did I come across as i'm looking through my old tv guide reviews?

[01:42:52.100 --> 01:42:58.100]   He was a wheeler dealer. He was a casino owner. He was very much like the other fringy
[01:42:58.100 --> 01:43:00.580]   We know that's perfect
[01:43:00.580 --> 01:43:06.500]   The color is perfect. I don't actually think they had to chain you mr. Trump's coloring. I don't think they did wow
[01:43:06.500 --> 01:43:09.060]   Yes, that's nice. Sure. Thank you

[01:43:26.260 --> 01:43:31.860]   I'm going through i'm going through and I find my old cosy reviews and my old picket fences reviews
[01:43:31.860 --> 01:43:34.180]   And then I come across a review of the site
[01:43:34.180 --> 01:43:36.980]   Oh, did you like it or not?
[01:43:37.380 --> 01:43:39.380]   I thank god I did
[01:43:39.380 --> 01:43:45.140]   And I even said something though anonymous nice about you. Okay, so it's it's in there. So the rundown
[01:43:45.140 --> 01:43:50.420]   Oh god, I scanned that into wow you're uh, so the site for those who don't know
[01:43:50.420 --> 01:43:58.980]   It was a show I helped create with ziff davis for the launch of msnbc when msnbc launched in 95 or six
[01:43:58.980 --> 01:44:01.620]   Uh, it was a joint venture of microsoft
[01:44:02.740 --> 01:44:09.700]   And nbc hence msnbc and nbc said oh crap. We're gonna have to do some technology programming
[01:44:09.700 --> 01:44:14.020]   So they came to ziff davis. I was working for ziff davis tv. I got a
[01:44:14.020 --> 01:44:17.780]   Really frantic call from bill mccrone
[01:44:17.780 --> 01:44:20.900]   christmas break
[01:44:20.900 --> 01:44:22.660]   95 I think
[01:44:22.660 --> 01:44:24.740]   Uh, he said we need he says quick
[01:44:24.740 --> 01:44:30.420]   We're going to new york next week to pitch a show to nbc. We need a treatment
[01:44:30.980 --> 01:44:32.980]   fast pronto
[01:44:32.980 --> 01:44:35.460]   And so I wrote a treatment wow for
[01:44:35.460 --> 01:44:39.620]   I wish we'd been able to do it. This predates, uh big brother
[01:44:39.620 --> 01:44:45.940]   The treatment was a little big brother. Oh, though. I wanted I wanted to get a victorian in san francisco
[01:44:45.940 --> 01:44:49.220]   Fill it with young people who were
[01:44:49.220 --> 01:44:51.380]   working on a website
[01:44:51.380 --> 01:44:56.900]   And have cameras everywhere so you could it was a early reality show really this is remember this mid-90s
[01:44:57.940 --> 01:45:02.580]   So you could watch these kids, you know, and you kind of they'd fall in love they'd yell at each other
[01:45:02.580 --> 01:45:08.740]   You could see what they were listening to yeah, no it's a traditional, but I don't think in 95
[01:45:08.740 --> 01:45:12.180]   I don't think there were any reality shows like that maybe there were
[01:45:12.180 --> 01:45:14.820]   But what was the what was the mtv one? What was the star?
[01:45:14.820 --> 01:45:19.140]   I thought it was the real world as something right real real. Yeah, when was the real world?
[01:45:19.140 --> 01:45:25.620]   Anyway, maybe I maybe I was cribbing it from mtv. I don't know you too. Okay, so I did know
[01:45:26.260 --> 01:45:30.260]   That's okay. That's what tv does. All right. Yeah, I didn't invent it. So we were trying to create the real world
[01:45:30.260 --> 01:45:35.620]   But with a tech angle so you'd be at a website and then and then the tv show
[01:45:35.620 --> 01:45:41.860]   Would be at the end of the day because they wanted a daily hour about what's going on in tech
[01:45:41.860 --> 01:45:46.420]   So I wanted to do this show about the show it would be web based and then you'd watch the show
[01:45:46.420 --> 01:45:51.860]   They loved the treatment. I remember Andy lack who was not was at nbc news is just left
[01:45:51.860 --> 01:45:53.700]   um
[01:45:53.700 --> 01:45:57.780]   Saying I wish my people would bring me something like this. He had his big cowboy boots up on the table and
[01:45:57.780 --> 01:46:02.020]   While we were pitching it it was fun. I pitched it with a bunch of zd executives
[01:46:02.020 --> 01:46:06.020]   And uh, but he bought it. I remember going down 30 rock, you know
[01:46:06.020 --> 01:46:09.060]   Lightness cigar
[01:46:09.060 --> 01:46:11.060]   Calling home on a phone booth saying
[01:46:11.060 --> 01:46:13.860]   They bought it. They bought it. We're green lighted
[01:46:13.860 --> 01:46:17.380]   Crushed honey pack your bags. We're moving to the big apple
[01:46:17.380 --> 01:46:19.540]   Uh
[01:46:19.540 --> 01:46:24.340]   They did change the concept considerably and they did as tv is what to do
[01:46:24.340 --> 01:46:28.020]   They didn't name it the site so they kind of got the idea I guess
[01:46:28.020 --> 01:46:30.100]   That but they couldn't get a better name than the site
[01:46:30.100 --> 01:46:35.460]   But that was all they could get even then and they had they were I was never going to be the the host
[01:46:35.460 --> 01:46:41.540]   But I was told that'd be the chief correspondent, you know, they're kind of the morally safer the uh, you know, uh,
[01:46:41.540 --> 01:46:43.540]   Chris wallace of the show, but um
[01:46:44.820 --> 01:46:48.980]   A solid at a brian anchored it and uh, they didn't nbc didn't like me
[01:46:48.980 --> 01:46:55.300]   So they had me play a virtual reality character on it called one mentioned in the review called dev no
[01:46:55.300 --> 01:47:00.340]   Which was unique at the time because it was in real animated in real time with a big silicon graphics onyx
[01:47:00.340 --> 01:47:05.540]   Computer and I was in the back karston was this is how I met karston karston worked with me on the site
[01:47:05.540 --> 01:47:09.380]   He was my puppeteer. So I would stand in a big
[01:47:09.380 --> 01:47:12.580]   Basically a rubber suit with dots on it
[01:47:13.380 --> 01:47:16.180]   Connected to wires and go like this
[01:47:16.180 --> 01:47:21.220]   And then I had a terribly awful annoying voice
[01:47:21.220 --> 01:47:28.900]   I was supposed to be a barista and then karston my hair would spin my eyebrows would go up and down karston would do all that stuff and uh
[01:47:28.900 --> 01:47:35.220]   And then uh, solid at would sit looking at a dot pretending to look and listen to me instead. She's just hearing
[01:47:35.220 --> 01:47:42.340]   And uh, and there's a blue dot that she's looking at the wall and they would superimpose it and that was it
[01:47:42.340 --> 01:47:45.460]   We and I want an Emmy for it. So I'm happy about that karston did too
[01:47:45.460 --> 01:47:51.300]   So uh, you say I do have complaints about the site that annoying dev no no that's not it
[01:47:51.300 --> 01:47:54.820]   The bottom bottom of the first column. Okay. She sold it out
[01:47:54.820 --> 01:48:01.300]   Yeah, we'll join in a techie gossip session with an animated coffee bartender a segment that should be obnoxious
[01:48:01.300 --> 01:48:03.540]   But is it oh bless you jeff?
[01:48:03.540 --> 01:48:10.660]   Hey, that's the best review i've ever gotten the only review I should be obnoxious, but i'm not
[01:48:11.300 --> 01:48:16.740]   I gave her a rave review to sola dad. What was great. She well she was on her way to fame and fortune
[01:48:16.740 --> 01:48:21.620]   Oh boy. She ever and you see knew that that's why they gave her the ang this was her, you know kind of
[01:48:21.620 --> 01:48:27.140]   Training watching past. Yeah, she had come from uh the local nbc affiliate channel
[01:48:27.140 --> 01:48:29.140]   I regret that I was a bit sexist here
[01:48:29.140 --> 01:48:34.420]   The secret to the size success. I think is its anchor the obviously intelligent terrifically poised
[01:48:34.420 --> 01:48:36.580]   perfectly pretty
[01:48:36.580 --> 01:48:40.740]   And uniquely named sola de la brian you had to do that for the alliteration. You just couldn't leave it
[01:48:40.740 --> 01:48:44.100]   I did I did I did so I did so I might regret that a little bit
[01:48:44.100 --> 01:48:47.380]   Not true. But a better guide to this weird wired new world
[01:48:47.380 --> 01:48:53.220]   O'Brien has not only has a confident command of the subject but is unafraid of asking the experts the dumb questions
[01:48:53.220 --> 01:48:56.500]   We in the audience would want to ask this is good
[01:48:56.500 --> 01:48:59.700]   This is very accurate. I think that's exactly uh
[01:48:59.700 --> 01:49:07.300]   Exactly what so so I the second column i'm amazed television has found any time to cover this still small new medium
[01:49:08.100 --> 01:49:10.260]   When tv still doesn't cover tv so well. Yeah
[01:49:10.260 --> 01:49:15.620]   They only did it because uh microsoft made them and 18 months later
[01:49:15.620 --> 01:49:22.660]   princess diana died in a horrific car crash msnbc went to wall to wall coverage and never
[01:49:22.660 --> 01:49:25.300]   Was that what did it in?
[01:49:25.300 --> 01:49:26.820]   Wow
[01:49:26.820 --> 01:49:28.980]   hiatus forgot that and
[01:49:28.980 --> 01:49:36.900]   That was it the show was gone and msnbc realized they got better ratings with sensational news stories than they did with oh my goodness
[01:49:36.900 --> 01:49:39.940]   Oh magazine shows about technology
[01:49:39.940 --> 01:49:46.260]   The audience even creates its own content the audience members interact with each other
[01:49:46.260 --> 01:49:51.220]   This is good. See you see you see that's kind of what I was trying to go for. Yeah, yeah, it was
[01:49:51.220 --> 01:49:57.780]   Um, it's a great picture window onto the mind of america. What have you you're a good writer jeff
[01:49:57.780 --> 01:50:01.060]   The couch critic former tv guy critic jeff
[01:50:01.060 --> 01:50:04.100]   So that all the former tv guy jokes
[01:50:04.100 --> 01:50:06.820]   There you go. Great
[01:50:07.140 --> 01:50:09.140]   So, yeah, she's in this to say you
[01:50:09.140 --> 01:50:13.140]   Oh good. You did I tweeted because she's very she's very active on twitter
[01:50:13.140 --> 01:50:16.100]   I'm glad you did that so i'm sure she was glad but she didn't seem to like her to respond
[01:50:16.100 --> 01:50:19.780]   I don't know if she because I apologize for my complimentary, but sexist language
[01:50:19.780 --> 01:50:24.340]   I don't know if she can't buy that yeah, I doubt she did
[01:50:24.340 --> 01:50:31.300]   Um, she probably didn't even notice it. You know what i'm gonna retweet it because I know she doesn't follow me
[01:50:31.300 --> 01:50:36.100]   Oh, oh look martha fengo one of the producers. Yes
[01:50:36.420 --> 01:50:39.940]   She was one of the producers. So that's cool. Nice
[01:50:39.940 --> 01:50:46.340]   Well, so anyway, we'll remember memory laying there. Sorry. Sorry aunt, uh, too old guys
[01:50:46.340 --> 01:50:53.460]   No, this is fascinating. I didn't know the origin story of mr. Laporta and mr. Bindi that she explains a lot
[01:50:53.460 --> 01:50:57.780]   He's my puppeteer, right?
[01:50:57.780 --> 01:51:00.740]   Spleins a lot
[01:51:04.420 --> 01:51:09.060]   Is carsten carsten is i didn't look is he talking in the uh, is he having memories in the chat?
[01:51:09.060 --> 01:51:11.620]   Yes, he's saying he's talking about the chat room
[01:51:11.620 --> 01:51:16.660]   Did we have car said we have the avatar chat even then I know we had it on tech tv
[01:51:16.660 --> 01:51:18.340]   Did we have it for the site?
[01:51:18.340 --> 01:51:22.500]   Because we had uh people could be avatars and wonder around and bump into each other and go
[01:51:22.500 --> 01:51:25.140]   He said that we had chat heads before there were chat heads pickles
[01:51:25.140 --> 01:51:32.020]   And that was the last time mrs. NBC ever covered technology
[01:51:33.700 --> 01:51:40.260]   Uh, he says his origin story. It's true. It's his origin story. Yeah, what was he what was carsten doing before the site
[01:51:40.260 --> 01:51:47.220]   Going to hovered. Yeah, I was gonna say was he in school. Wait, wait, it wasn't his first job. No, I uh, I don't know
[01:51:47.220 --> 01:51:48.420]   What did you do?
[01:51:48.420 --> 01:51:52.340]   It by the way, it wasn't just carsten there were it took two people to
[01:51:52.340 --> 01:51:58.980]   To keep dev know hair spinning and eyebrows bumping and one the other was christine and I can't remember christines
[01:51:59.700 --> 01:52:05.300]   Last name but car and she might be happy of that fact but carsten and christine were my puppete
[01:52:05.300 --> 01:52:08.900]   priest says carsten enjoys pulling all the strings. Yes, that's indeed true
[01:52:08.900 --> 01:52:16.500]   Jeff, can you find a picture of dev know oh, yeah, that's he's pretty fun. Yeah, I could do it
[01:52:16.500 --> 01:52:21.780]   If you just just took look for images of dev know oh it's sad
[01:52:21.780 --> 01:52:27.860]   There are lots of other images now of dev know but this is the canonical. Oh, he's a wiki pedia entry
[01:52:28.740 --> 01:52:30.740]   Yeah
[01:52:30.740 --> 01:52:34.740]   Look at that. I had no idea. I was so famous
[01:52:34.740 --> 01:52:40.820]   Can you remember the voice? Can you do the voice? Yes, definitely. I don't have to remember the voice. I can actually uh do it
[01:52:40.820 --> 01:52:44.500]   You just might be famous. No, it was awful
[01:52:44.500 --> 01:52:45.620]   Oh, look
[01:52:45.620 --> 01:52:51.220]   All of the long stories that I have told again and again it finally made it into wiki pedia
[01:52:51.220 --> 01:52:53.940]   That's it three piece soon cowboy boots
[01:52:55.940 --> 01:52:58.740]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, this is all true
[01:52:58.740 --> 01:53:06.820]   David borman remembered she would do real-time q&a with his cartoon character was the smartest purple people person in the world when it came to technology issues
[01:53:06.820 --> 01:53:09.300]   It was great. Wow
[01:53:09.300 --> 01:53:12.340]   Wow, wow
[01:53:12.340 --> 01:53:14.500]   Yeah, all right. Never
[01:53:14.500 --> 01:53:18.340]   Well, you know, I'm glad to fill aunt in because somehow he missed it
[01:53:20.100 --> 01:53:25.860]   His history carston says he wasn't doing anything. It was his first real job
[01:53:25.860 --> 01:53:32.740]   He had some crap jobs before that we plucked him from obscurity to be carston. What was your worst job?
[01:53:32.740 --> 01:53:40.820]   He was in charge of all the virtual characters at ctv dev know definitely and tech tv and then ex-play yeah, he did
[01:53:40.820 --> 01:53:44.980]   uh because we kept that technology around and
[01:53:44.980 --> 01:53:49.220]   People may remember that we had virtual characters and they launched a tech tv
[01:53:50.020 --> 01:53:51.220]   uh
[01:53:51.220 --> 01:53:52.820]   who uh
[01:53:52.820 --> 01:53:57.220]   Cape patella played one in her name. There was tilde. It was her name was tilde
[01:53:57.220 --> 01:54:01.300]   And uh, and then there was a guy who played dash
[01:54:01.300 --> 01:54:05.300]   It was tilde and dash the virtual. I bet I could find that too
[01:54:05.300 --> 01:54:08.260]   Wow
[01:54:08.260 --> 01:54:15.140]   It was the same technology though, although the biggest difference was
[01:54:15.140 --> 01:54:18.260]   um
[01:54:18.260 --> 01:54:25.860]   The um lip syncing was done with their fingers now instead of done automatically
[01:54:25.860 --> 01:54:29.300]   Uh
[01:54:29.300 --> 01:54:32.020]   There she is. This is gold
[01:54:32.020 --> 01:54:37.300]   And it's the same glitch. Yeah kind of gestures. You can't it was a terrible
[01:54:37.300 --> 01:54:42.980]   It was really primitive based compared to what we got now. This is 1997
[01:54:42.980 --> 01:54:46.100]   uh 98
[01:54:46.900 --> 01:54:48.260]   Yeah, my review was
[01:54:48.260 --> 01:54:53.460]   No, no, no, oh no ziti you're talking about the site the site was six
[01:54:53.460 --> 01:54:59.860]   I said, yeah, so I reviewed it in uh, may 97. Yes, that's right before princess diane
[01:54:59.860 --> 01:55:04.580]   It's like got to a chance before this show went away. Oh god
[01:55:04.580 --> 01:55:12.900]   Yeah, she died in august of 97. So yeah a few months a few months later. We were on the end the and the commercial web
[01:55:13.380 --> 01:55:17.540]   Was introduced on october 94. It was great. We were right here as in you read it
[01:55:17.540 --> 01:55:22.340]   I remember uh, I had a young friend. He was in his it was a young as a teenager
[01:55:22.340 --> 01:55:24.500]   I guess he had gone to college
[01:55:24.500 --> 01:55:27.140]   He ended up working for us in sales for a while glenn roobenstein
[01:55:27.140 --> 01:55:31.300]   And he said and I used to he used to be on my radio show talking as a gamer
[01:55:31.300 --> 01:55:33.780]   He wrote a gaming column for the petalima august courier
[01:55:33.780 --> 01:55:38.340]   Uh, and he was in college by then he said layout. Oh my gosh. You got to see
[01:55:39.220 --> 01:55:43.540]   But we set up this server in our dorm room and there's this thing called mp3s
[01:55:43.540 --> 01:55:47.540]   And everybody's put all their records on the server and everybody in the college
[01:55:47.540 --> 01:55:51.540]   Can hear everybody else's music? It's amazing. You're not telling everybody about mp3s
[01:55:51.540 --> 01:55:59.460]   So I think I did the very first mainstream media coverage of mp3s. Uh, what what year was that? That would have been 96 or 97. Yeah
[01:55:59.460 --> 01:56:04.260]   So some of the lead to this review is it's just sort of anachronistic
[01:56:04.660 --> 01:56:09.700]   Whether you're just now getting curious about this internet thing or whether you're already addicted
[01:56:09.700 --> 01:56:14.740]   There's no better single source to tell you what's happening in network american today than msmbz the site
[01:56:14.740 --> 01:56:20.740]   That was beautiful. Just getting curious. Yeah, if you're just if you're just now hearing about this thing called internet
[01:56:20.740 --> 01:56:26.660]   This is the place to go. We had a beautiful set. It was an open studio was nice. They bought a lot of equipment
[01:56:26.660 --> 01:56:30.980]   Beautiful and where was it? It was in san francisco on
[01:56:30.980 --> 01:56:33.700]   Um, york's there was york street
[01:56:34.340 --> 01:56:38.580]   Uh, it was in an old warehouse and they painted a beauty it was similar to this really
[01:56:38.580 --> 01:56:42.900]   I mean a lot of what I did with the various studios looked a lot like those original tech tv
[01:56:42.900 --> 01:56:47.060]   And before it was the same place we did tech tv the before tech tv the site
[01:56:47.060 --> 01:56:48.900]   Uh, and uh
[01:56:48.900 --> 01:56:50.900]   We there was a one open wall
[01:56:50.900 --> 01:56:56.900]   They painted a beautiful mural of san francisco bay with a sailboat on it a spinnaker billing a blowing out
[01:56:56.900 --> 01:57:01.940]   And I remember david borman and i and some others walking in to look at the mural
[01:57:02.580 --> 01:57:08.500]   And the spinnaker which is you know is that big front sail that that that is in front of a sailboat
[01:57:08.500 --> 01:57:14.100]   So the sailboat has these sails like this and then there's a big front sail look like nothing more than a giant ass
[01:57:14.100 --> 01:57:19.140]   Come on all walked in and we went
[01:57:19.140 --> 01:57:22.180]   Oh
[01:57:22.180 --> 01:57:27.220]   They had to paint it over. They couldn't use it. Oh no real age i had bought on the wall
[01:57:27.940 --> 01:57:32.660]   Just right up there with the gaffney south carolina peach that I drive by
[01:57:32.660 --> 01:57:39.940]   It's in that peach which is a giant peach is it on the water tank?
[01:57:39.940 --> 01:57:45.700]   It's a water tower. Yes, sir a but yeah, it is the water tower. It looks like a giant but
[01:57:45.700 --> 01:57:50.820]   Yep, this looks like that gaffney south kecky likey
[01:57:54.580 --> 01:58:00.180]   So here's video of you. Oh, yeah, there's video and actually just heard from this video
[01:58:00.180 --> 01:58:03.780]   I'm singing one of the videos. I'm singing with a former member of
[01:58:03.780 --> 01:58:06.340]   the turtles
[01:58:06.340 --> 01:58:12.100]   And uh, he just he's just put out a book in which we're I mentioned this this scene where we sang together
[01:58:12.100 --> 01:58:16.020]   He sang with a virtual character is mentioned in his book and he um
[01:58:16.020 --> 01:58:21.540]   I can't remember his last name and he's gonna kill me because he wants me to publicize the book
[01:58:21.540 --> 01:58:24.420]   um
[01:58:24.420 --> 01:58:26.420]   Are you watching the video?
[01:58:26.420 --> 01:58:29.220]   Yeah, it was. Yeah, I think so it would be dev
[01:58:29.220 --> 01:58:31.860]   cyberlistic
[01:58:31.860 --> 01:58:35.380]   The site and I think Andy kahan. I think that was his name
[01:58:35.380 --> 01:58:40.020]   Let me see if I can find it because we yeah, here it is
[01:58:40.020 --> 01:58:42.980]   1997
[01:58:42.980 --> 01:58:50.580]   That's definitely not it
[01:58:51.460 --> 01:58:54.260]   Here we go. Here we go. Soledad of ryan

[01:59:05.540 --> 01:59:08.500]   They wanted to say h t t p
[01:59:08.500 --> 01:59:09.540]   Oh

[01:59:17.540 --> 01:59:21.940]   If I really didn't want him to say w w w but I guess you probably had to say that at then
[01:59:21.940 --> 01:59:23.940]   But yeah, I've I won that fight
[01:59:23.940 --> 01:59:29.140]   Backslash backslash backslash that was the other thing and we just say slash it backslash
[01:59:29.140 --> 01:59:32.100]   It's not a backslash. It's a slash but anyway
[01:59:32.100 --> 01:59:35.460]   Here let's go back and watch some more
[01:59:35.460 --> 01:59:43.700]   Website at the site dot m s n b c dot com or w w w dot the site dot com. I'm soledad o brian. Good night
[01:59:45.140 --> 01:59:47.140]   This is so good.
[01:59:47.140 --> 01:59:49.140]   So
[01:59:49.140 --> 01:59:51.140]   You
[01:59:51.140 --> 01:59:53.140]   And you said you belong to me
[02:00:17.780 --> 02:00:25.060]   Just as a point of if they hadn't painted over that mural showed again that big but would be right there
[02:00:25.060 --> 02:00:33.700]   So now you know why they had to paint over them you did did did one of you
[02:00:33.700 --> 02:00:38.900]   Did you both notice it as a but immediately the other one says oh yeah or did you all just saw
[02:00:38.900 --> 02:00:42.820]   I think it's maybe I'm misimagining it's kind of like
[02:00:42.820 --> 02:00:46.740]   A classic tv show the three of us walk in
[02:00:47.620 --> 02:00:49.620]   And our jaws go
[02:00:49.620 --> 02:00:55.700]   There was no question. It was a giant ass and then you heard the lab track behind it. Yeah
[02:00:55.700 --> 02:00:59.380]   Was there was just no question
[02:00:59.380 --> 02:01:02.340]   Here's a little more since you didn't get enough
[02:01:02.340 --> 02:01:07.060]   Of the site. Let me see if I can get some dev null in here. Here we go. Here we go
[02:01:07.060 --> 02:01:09.060]   Just so you just so you can see me
[02:01:09.060 --> 02:01:11.860]   This is the most annoying voice in the world
[02:01:11.860 --> 02:01:16.900]   Like I like to give you the opportunity to slam me right at the beginning so then people won't get mad when I retaliate
[02:01:16.900 --> 02:01:21.060]   But so far you have yet to take me up on this you're so polite. You're so kind
[02:01:21.060 --> 02:01:26.420]   You just make me crazy. Hey, I got a great bit for you. This is this is a great
[02:01:26.420 --> 02:01:33.700]   I think it's your attention. Hey, hey, I know you're not exactly thrilled to be here. So I'm just trying to get your attention
[02:01:33.700 --> 02:01:36.820]   Oh, yeah, right. Yeah, sure here
[02:01:36.820 --> 02:01:39.220]   Kind of
[02:01:39.220 --> 02:01:41.220]   She's here her mother
[02:01:41.300 --> 02:01:46.500]   Once asked her solely so did that are you still working with that vile little puppet man?
[02:01:46.500 --> 02:01:55.780]   Yep, I want that on my tombstone
[02:01:55.780 --> 02:01:59.940]   The diall the RIP the vile little puppet man
[02:01:59.940 --> 02:02:06.900]   Did they tune your voice pitch or was that just me coming out talking like that why I chose that because it's a really horrible
[02:02:07.060 --> 02:02:11.860]   Annoying voice. I don't know why but that's what I imagined a digital barista might sound like
[02:02:11.860 --> 02:02:14.500]   Okay, it's so annoying
[02:02:14.500 --> 02:02:17.620]   Yeah, yeah
[02:02:17.620 --> 02:02:19.620]   No, I know
[02:02:19.620 --> 02:02:25.380]   It was a big mistake, but once you do it you you can't change your voice all of a sudden. Yeah, too late. No, yeah
[02:02:25.380 --> 02:02:28.180]   How scripted was it? Totally?
[02:02:28.180 --> 02:02:32.180]   Run down? No, not even a rundown. She had no idea what I was gonna say
[02:02:32.180 --> 02:02:35.940]   Oh really it was actually I think they did it because it was very good for her
[02:02:36.900 --> 02:02:41.780]   One the only knock on sola dad was she was very formal and rigid
[02:02:41.780 --> 02:02:47.380]   Stiff been more just Paul, you know old school lose caster where you would just
[02:02:47.380 --> 02:02:52.260]   She talked to do that right they're taught to do that. Okay, and I think they wanted her to loosen up a little bit
[02:02:52.260 --> 02:02:58.100]   So you couldn't get more loose than lea la farga. Hey, hey her career flashing before her
[02:02:58.100 --> 02:03:03.060]   Talked out sounds like web heaven to me, but I guess that to some of the
[02:03:04.580 --> 02:03:08.420]   She was a great thing. She's so unhappy to be there because it really was
[02:03:08.420 --> 02:03:12.260]   She was trying to establish herself as a credible
[02:03:12.260 --> 02:03:14.900]   Journalist and here's this guy
[02:03:14.900 --> 02:03:22.420]   At most websites. I mean isn't advertising really how the web is supported right?
[02:03:22.420 --> 02:03:26.420]   Oh, basically. Yeah, you're undermining the entire infrastructure of the web sure. Okay
[02:03:26.420 --> 02:03:32.100]   Just want to clarify that point. Thank you. Okay. All right. Can I get some email? Oh, please do
[02:03:32.980 --> 02:03:34.980]   From dave o' brian
[02:03:34.980 --> 02:03:39.620]   She would then she would then read the questions. It was a terrible embarrassing
[02:03:39.620 --> 02:03:42.820]   Every oh it's great every moment
[02:03:42.820 --> 02:03:45.860]   Was an embarrassment to me
[02:03:45.860 --> 02:03:50.580]   And they all I mean literally I go in I would have a stomachache when I would arrive at the studio
[02:03:50.580 --> 02:03:54.980]   And the only redeeming thing was I then won a tiny little local emmy
[02:03:54.980 --> 02:04:00.180]   But I'm now an Emmy award winner. So that's all I'm just like you're a former tv guide critic
[02:04:00.660 --> 02:04:05.220]   I'm yeah, I'm an Emmy you never lose the good stuff. Yeah, you got that on your record brother
[02:04:05.220 --> 02:04:07.700]   That's permanent
[02:04:07.700 --> 02:04:14.020]   So we had a late news day news week, but we have that let's take a break and uh wrap things up with your picks
[02:04:14.020 --> 02:04:17.220]   Of dear week of der vina schnitzel
[02:04:17.220 --> 02:04:22.660]   But first a word from our sponsor express vpn. I hope you know a lot of people
[02:04:22.660 --> 02:04:28.100]   Think well, I'm at home. I don't need to use a vpn anymore. And it's true people have been using vpn's
[02:04:28.980 --> 02:04:34.260]   Especially express vpn to protect yourself at a coffee shop or an open access point when you go to a hotel
[02:04:34.260 --> 02:04:39.860]   You're at a conference. Yeah, absolutely you'd be nuts not to use express vpn, but you get home
[02:04:39.860 --> 02:04:41.700]   You think i'm safe, but you know what no
[02:04:41.700 --> 02:04:44.820]   No, in fact, maybe you need it even more because you know
[02:04:44.820 --> 02:04:50.100]   It's completely legal for your internet service provider to make a note of every single site you give you visit
[02:04:50.100 --> 02:04:55.140]   And then give that information to marketers sell it. They don't give it sell it to marketers
[02:04:55.540 --> 02:04:58.900]   It's they've been doing it for years your privacy
[02:04:58.900 --> 02:05:05.780]   And not important express vpn is a great way to protect your privacy your security even while you're at home
[02:05:05.780 --> 02:05:07.860]   That's why even when i'm at home
[02:05:07.860 --> 02:05:11.060]   I never go online without using express vpn
[02:05:11.060 --> 02:05:15.700]   It's a great way if you've burned through your entire netflix library and who hasn't by now
[02:05:15.700 --> 02:05:18.180]   Do you just fire up netflix?
[02:05:18.180 --> 02:05:23.620]   Fire up express vpn it comes on android ios windows mac linux every browser
[02:05:23.780 --> 02:05:25.780]   You just start the vpn
[02:05:25.780 --> 02:05:31.380]   But this time instead of picking the one the automatic one the one closest to you you could choose realistic countries
[02:05:31.380 --> 02:05:35.140]   I want to be in england today boom you're in london
[02:05:35.140 --> 02:05:39.780]   You haven't moved an inch but you are in london and suddenly when you refresh netflix
[02:05:39.780 --> 02:05:46.020]   You're in uk netflix uk you get all the doctor who episodes all the different content in netflix uk
[02:05:46.020 --> 02:05:52.100]   I want to be in tokyo today so I can watch some anime boom like that. That's very cool
[02:05:52.420 --> 02:05:59.060]   So what do you get you get security you get privacy you get the ability to watch content anywhere in
[02:05:59.060 --> 02:06:04.900]   The world that's express vpn now it's very important when you choose a vpn to make sure it's private
[02:06:04.900 --> 02:06:08.500]   Because yeah your isp can't see you but now you're
[02:06:08.500 --> 02:06:17.380]   In effect express vpn's your isp they could you want to make sure they're going to respect you express vpn does read the privacy policy
[02:06:17.700 --> 02:06:22.260]   Audit by independent third parties. It's exactly what it says it is but even better than that
[02:06:22.260 --> 02:06:25.140]   They've invented a technology that
[02:06:25.140 --> 02:06:30.500]   Makes it impossible for them to track you to log you to see what you're doing
[02:06:30.500 --> 02:06:35.860]   It's called trusted server when you log into that vpn server. They spin it up. It sits in ram and never
[02:06:35.860 --> 02:06:41.380]   Can access the hard drive? It's literally sandboxed so that no trace of your visit
[02:06:41.380 --> 02:06:46.820]   Exists and as soon as you log off it's gone and so is your
[02:06:47.780 --> 02:06:50.420]   Complete track record your log it's all disappeared
[02:06:50.420 --> 02:06:59.300]   That's really important and by the way the auditors also said trusted v server does exactly what express vpn does look i've looked at all the
[02:06:59.300 --> 02:07:06.020]   vpn's express vpn is the best i'm not alone number one cnet number one wired
[02:07:06.020 --> 02:07:12.500]   Uh and right now you can get a good deal less than seven bucks a month when you go to express vpn.com/twig
[02:07:14.180 --> 02:07:23.060]   Get an extra three months free on a one-year package. So express vpn.com/twig express vpn
[02:07:23.060 --> 02:07:25.460]   dot com
[02:07:25.460 --> 02:07:30.580]   Slash twig. Thank you express vpn for supporting our show by the way
[02:07:30.580 --> 02:07:35.060]   We really appreciate it and I thank you for supporting the show by using that especially you are
[02:07:35.060 --> 02:07:41.860]   Express vpn.com slash twig. I didn't even look to see if there's a change lock today. I feel terrible
[02:07:42.420 --> 02:07:46.020]   Is there oh it's a it's a it's a wee little change log
[02:07:46.020 --> 02:07:53.540]   It's a demi change log play the trumpets the google change log
[02:07:53.540 --> 02:08:01.940]   I think google is a little influenced by all this talk about privacy
[02:08:01.940 --> 02:08:05.780]   I think they're a little bit hurt that apples become the privacy company
[02:08:05.780 --> 02:08:07.700]   They say now
[02:08:07.700 --> 02:08:11.940]   That they will auto delete location and search data automatically
[02:08:12.500 --> 02:08:15.300]   By default for new users after 18 months
[02:08:15.300 --> 02:08:17.540]   Oh
[02:08:17.540 --> 02:08:19.380]   Did wait me to say new
[02:08:19.380 --> 02:08:22.420]   Well, I think it's for anybody you can chant you can turn that on
[02:08:22.420 --> 02:08:25.300]   But now it's going to be the default for new users
[02:08:25.300 --> 02:08:31.700]   So in other words, it wasn't the default you can't turn it on if you're but from now on it will be the default
[02:08:31.700 --> 02:08:37.060]   Yeah, sure 18 months is pretty much used up. It's used up all its value to google
[02:08:39.540 --> 02:08:41.540]   That's exactly what they're saying. Yeah
[02:08:41.540 --> 02:08:47.860]   So you can't make it even shorter to three months if you want that's in the activity controls page
[02:08:47.860 --> 02:08:55.220]   So I leave it on to be honest, but you have this auto delete option auto delete activity older than three months
[02:08:55.220 --> 02:09:00.980]   Auto delete auto older than 18 months and that is the new default or I just leave it on because
[02:09:00.980 --> 02:09:04.820]   I like to know
[02:09:04.820 --> 02:09:08.100]   Everywhere I've been and if I do get sick. I think this is better
[02:09:08.740 --> 02:09:14.420]   Than the covet 19 tracker. I could I could tell a contact razor. Yeah, here's all the places I went
[02:09:14.420 --> 02:09:18.580]   That's going to help them a lot. So I leave my location history on but it's up to you
[02:09:18.580 --> 02:09:25.460]   Whether you want to only lift it on because of my own vanity just to see where I've been because I know people
[02:09:25.460 --> 02:09:29.700]   In my family haven't been able to travel like I've traveled and it's just a nice little
[02:09:29.700 --> 02:09:32.100]   Vanity reminder
[02:09:32.100 --> 02:09:34.100]   You're right. It's vanity
[02:09:34.100 --> 02:09:36.980]   You're right. I'm vain too
[02:09:38.020 --> 02:09:43.060]   I like to know I like to look at the magic admitted. Yeah, you're right. See he's honest. We said that
[02:09:43.060 --> 02:09:45.540]   See that's the thing. He's honest. I'm like us. He's honest
[02:09:45.540 --> 02:09:52.420]   Okay, I admit it is vanity youtube history you can do this with location history web and app activity
[02:09:52.420 --> 02:09:56.660]   All have deletions. They've always had deletions or at least for some time
[02:09:56.660 --> 02:10:00.980]   So I think that's good to know and I like it that it's on by default 18 months
[02:10:00.980 --> 02:10:02.980]   Google can do that
[02:10:02.980 --> 02:10:06.260]   You know, but he wants that information after a probably after a week
[02:10:06.900 --> 02:10:12.100]   But anyway, uh, google has all can you hold on to it? Can you can you say no? Don't kill it up?
[02:10:12.100 --> 02:10:14.340]   Okay forever. I want to
[02:10:14.340 --> 02:10:17.700]   Okay, I want my children to inherit my location activity
[02:10:17.700 --> 02:10:24.500]   Son, I can't give you any money, but here's a list everywhere. I've been for the last 40 years
[02:10:24.500 --> 02:10:30.580]   Google ends a trial of a photo service that picked and printed photos for users
[02:10:30.580 --> 02:10:34.660]   We talked about this. This was in the changelog months ago. It's gone
[02:10:35.620 --> 02:10:37.300]   Yeah
[02:10:37.300 --> 02:10:39.060]   Guess nobody wanted
[02:10:39.060 --> 02:10:44.500]   The automatic pick it launched in february. It was $8 a month. That's one of the reasons
[02:10:44.500 --> 02:10:50.420]   I we did it on the changelog. I mentioned it and never thought about it again. Apparently. I'm not alone
[02:10:50.420 --> 02:10:52.660]   No, eight dollars a month
[02:10:52.660 --> 02:10:56.900]   You would get photos you didn't pick you would get 10. That's a good deal. No problem
[02:10:56.900 --> 02:11:01.300]   Yeah, plus in a bucket print four by six prints for the last month
[02:11:01.860 --> 02:11:06.660]   You could say I'd more interested in people in pets landscapes or whatever, but basically google
[02:11:06.660 --> 02:11:11.460]   And you could edit the picks, but nobody was going to do that. I would get 10 pictures of whiteboards
[02:11:11.460 --> 02:11:14.420]   You might
[02:11:14.420 --> 02:11:16.820]   Or lunches you might anyway
[02:11:16.820 --> 02:11:22.100]   Google says thank you for your invaluable feedback these last several months
[02:11:22.100 --> 02:11:26.180]   You saved us from wasting yet more money on this talk
[02:11:26.180 --> 02:11:28.420]   Thanks
[02:11:28.420 --> 02:11:33.060]   Now I thought we showed this last time, but I think I showed the wrong thing
[02:11:33.060 --> 02:11:39.380]   So I talked about last week a google competitor from their 120 area 120
[02:11:39.380 --> 02:11:41.300]   Labs
[02:11:41.300 --> 02:11:44.100]   A competitive Pinterest, but I think I showed the wrong thing
[02:11:44.100 --> 02:11:49.140]   So i'm going to show you keen, which is now out. I didn't have it then it looks so much like Pinterest
[02:11:49.140 --> 02:11:51.780]   You wouldn't believe it you choose
[02:11:51.780 --> 02:11:55.620]   Your favorite topics. Uh, I don't know somehow i'm getting
[02:11:55.620 --> 02:11:58.340]   fans of foraging
[02:11:58.820 --> 02:12:00.820]   visit omay tepe
[02:12:00.820 --> 02:12:05.620]   Metal heads boy. They don't know me that well learn bird watching
[02:12:05.620 --> 02:12:10.980]   Catch and cook. Oh here we go catch and cook crayfish cajun style
[02:12:10.980 --> 02:12:14.100]   All right, and if I follow that they'll be
[02:12:14.100 --> 02:12:17.380]   Pinterest style
[02:12:17.380 --> 02:12:25.220]   You know, not just pictures, but here's a youtube video gordon ramsi demonstrates how to prepare a boil and peel crayfish perfectly
[02:12:25.940 --> 02:12:32.020]   Uh how to boil crayfish do you do the crayfish or crawfish and
[02:12:32.020 --> 02:12:35.220]   Where i'm from is crawfish
[02:12:35.220 --> 02:12:36.740]   Okay, I thought so
[02:12:36.740 --> 02:12:38.500]   Am I saying it wrong?
[02:12:38.500 --> 02:12:40.500]   No, you're not saying it wrong
[02:12:40.500 --> 02:12:42.500]   I always say we just as a kid
[02:12:42.500 --> 02:12:47.220]   But it's spelled crawfish. I thought I was being like all cool Louisiana style
[02:12:47.220 --> 02:12:50.500]   Crawfish negative
[02:12:50.500 --> 02:12:51.860]   Negatory
[02:12:51.860 --> 02:12:54.420]   That's a negative sir. It's a crawfish
[02:12:55.380 --> 02:12:56.900]   Crawdads
[02:12:56.900 --> 02:13:00.980]   Crawdads. Yep. Why do I call them crayfish? Maybe that's just an error that's come
[02:13:00.980 --> 02:13:06.100]   And we know i've heard it. I've heard it even where i'm from. I've heard other people say it that way
[02:13:06.100 --> 02:13:11.540]   But the majority of us have said crawfish take the ruling event here. Yeah, no, no
[02:13:11.540 --> 02:13:16.820]   I completely deferred to add. I'm gonna say crawfish from now. I thought I was being smart, you know, like you don't say
[02:13:16.820 --> 02:13:19.620]   I don't know
[02:13:19.620 --> 02:13:25.300]   That should don't you probably say pecan don't I don't say pecan I say pecan and I say abracad
[02:13:25.300 --> 02:13:26.100]   I love you sir
[02:13:26.100 --> 02:13:27.300]   It's pecan
[02:13:27.300 --> 02:13:28.740]   It's pecan
[02:13:28.740 --> 02:13:30.740]   Who says pecan?
[02:13:30.740 --> 02:13:32.340]   Somebody in the mom
[02:13:32.340 --> 02:13:33.460]   Really? Pecan
[02:13:33.460 --> 02:13:34.260]   My mom's really
[02:13:34.260 --> 02:13:34.980]   Pecan
[02:13:34.980 --> 02:13:35.540]   Pecan
[02:13:35.540 --> 02:13:36.660]   Blows mom
[02:13:36.660 --> 02:13:37.700]   Are we? Are we?
[02:13:37.700 --> 02:13:38.820]   Everybody else in the house says pecan
[02:13:38.820 --> 02:13:42.500]   The person married to your uncle. What is that person?
[02:13:42.500 --> 02:13:46.100]   Oh my um aunt
[02:13:46.100 --> 02:13:48.980]   I say what it I mean
[02:13:48.980 --> 02:13:50.020]   I'm an
[02:13:50.020 --> 02:13:51.140]   I say it's like
[02:13:51.140 --> 02:13:55.380]   But that's the thing we it's at least in my family. It said both ways
[02:13:55.380 --> 02:13:58.180]   Somewhat both ways it's it's aunt
[02:13:58.180 --> 02:13:59.780]   Or it's
[02:13:59.780 --> 02:14:02.260]   Aunt is not aunt is oh
[02:14:02.260 --> 02:14:08.180]   Oh wow, look at this really really country. So my I have an aunt sue
[02:14:08.180 --> 02:14:10.820]   Carson says
[02:14:10.820 --> 02:14:14.580]   Carson says this is going to be a new segment we should do on the show
[02:14:14.580 --> 02:14:17.140]   Carson says
[02:14:17.140 --> 02:14:19.140]   It's actually crayfish
[02:14:19.620 --> 02:14:21.620]   That's how we say it
[02:14:21.620 --> 02:14:23.620]   That's how we say it at hovid
[02:14:23.620 --> 02:14:26.420]   Well, I don't trust Wikipedia for anything
[02:14:26.420 --> 02:14:28.740]   Anyways, I'm sorry karsten or ant
[02:14:28.740 --> 02:14:32.420]   No, no crayfish is the is the actual crustacean
[02:14:32.420 --> 02:14:38.500]   Known as crawfish crawdads fresh water lobsters mountain lobsters right mud bugs or yabbies
[02:14:38.500 --> 02:14:41.540]   Mud bugs. Yep mud bugs
[02:14:41.540 --> 02:14:43.140]   uh
[02:14:43.140 --> 02:14:46.740]   I guess up back up, you know, new england we call them crayfish
[02:14:47.780 --> 02:14:49.140]   but uh
[02:14:49.140 --> 02:14:51.140]   So crawfish is actually slang
[02:14:51.140 --> 02:14:56.580]   crayfishes but it was in the in google it's you in the know by saying crawfish
[02:14:56.580 --> 02:14:59.060]   puts me
[02:14:59.060 --> 02:15:01.780]   crayfish
[02:15:01.780 --> 02:15:09.540]   Causton says it makes sense though if it's if it's pronounced as slang crawfish in luizian it makes perfect sense to me
[02:15:09.540 --> 02:15:13.620]   Causton says park the crayfish and hovid yards
[02:15:15.620 --> 02:15:18.580]   Googles the new segments carston says
[02:15:18.580 --> 02:15:23.380]   Carston corrects. Oh, let's do it carston you're in charge. I love it
[02:15:23.380 --> 02:15:30.740]   Carson you are now in charge of the brand new segment. It'll be you know jeff's number ants thing
[02:15:30.740 --> 02:15:32.340]   And
[02:15:32.340 --> 02:15:36.420]   Causton correct and here is the other thing I want to bring back dev nal
[02:15:36.420 --> 02:15:40.900]   So we have the virtual carston with you in the studio. All right
[02:15:40.900 --> 02:15:44.020]   All right, all right. It's easier now, right?
[02:15:44.500 --> 02:15:50.180]   It is he's a carston voice. I met I was at the webbies one year and I met the guy who did the software for it
[02:15:50.180 --> 02:15:52.740]   For the company that did it called protozoa
[02:15:52.740 --> 02:15:58.580]   Uh, we met over we met at the urinals and he said oh, it's leo. Hey leo. I said hi
[02:15:58.580 --> 02:16:02.420]   Uh, and he said you know that part out, but he said, you know
[02:16:02.420 --> 02:16:06.500]   Could have left that out that'll be in wikipedia next week. He said, you know
[02:16:06.500 --> 02:16:10.500]   We still have the models for dev null we could do it again
[02:16:10.500 --> 02:16:14.820]   But we wouldn't need a million dollar silicon graphics onyx anymore. We could do it on a pc
[02:16:14.820 --> 02:16:16.500]   Right
[02:16:16.500 --> 02:16:19.940]   So this was years ago. I thought we would do I would thought you guys would be
[02:16:19.940 --> 02:16:24.260]   Avatars by now. I really thought it was gonna work carston. No. Yeah
[02:16:24.260 --> 02:16:27.540]   Last one then we're gonna wrap it up google meet now has
[02:16:27.540 --> 02:16:34.500]   a meet dot new shortcut so that you can quickly start new video conferences just
[02:16:34.500 --> 02:16:37.220]   send out that link meet dot new
[02:16:38.340 --> 02:16:42.740]   And there's also docs dot new sheets. I didn't know this sheets dot new or slides dot new
[02:16:42.740 --> 02:16:48.180]   So if I go to meet dot new it'll just oh here. We are we're in a conference
[02:16:48.180 --> 02:16:55.220]   Now there's a long seems like we talked about them working on this several months ago either here on twig or on all about
[02:16:55.220 --> 02:17:01.220]   And maybe it was I didn't know we did that okay. It'll start it with you know the usual, you know 10 letter
[02:17:01.220 --> 02:17:05.620]   Code, but you don't have to you know, you just look at that. That's nice. No software. Nothing
[02:17:06.660 --> 02:17:13.380]   Meet dot new can you imagine the product meeting there the the the the hangout slash meet product mean when they said
[02:17:13.380 --> 02:17:15.860]   zoom who figured zoom
[02:17:15.860 --> 02:17:18.340]   What the hell?
[02:17:18.340 --> 02:17:20.180]   Damn that zoom
[02:17:20.180 --> 02:17:21.620]   Damn them
[02:17:21.620 --> 02:17:26.100]   All right, and that my friends is the little mini teeny tiny crayfish version
[02:17:26.100 --> 02:17:29.060]   of the google change
[02:17:29.060 --> 02:17:32.820]   Great fish. I say crawfish
[02:17:34.260 --> 02:17:36.260]   All right, what do you got for us today?
[02:17:36.260 --> 02:17:43.380]   Uh, my pick of the week is from our good friend at a network mr
[02:17:43.380 --> 02:17:45.940]   Rick salmon rick. Yeah
[02:17:45.940 --> 02:17:49.060]   And his new book photo quest
[02:17:49.060 --> 02:17:51.860]   This man is awesome. He's a
[02:17:51.860 --> 02:18:00.100]   Outstanding photographer outstanding teacher and just flat out good person and all of he's written. This is his 41st book
[02:18:00.100 --> 02:18:03.620]   41 42 he's written a lot of dad gum books
[02:18:04.020 --> 02:18:07.460]   Uh, but this is another photography book that doesn't have any pictures in it
[02:18:07.460 --> 02:18:16.100]   And it's just a way to help these creators be inspired and just find their flow and uh, I just got it a week or two ago
[02:18:16.100 --> 02:18:21.540]   Um, I appreciate him sending this over to me and i'm really really digging it thus far
[02:18:21.540 --> 02:18:24.580]   I love ricks and he loves mr
[02:18:24.580 --> 02:18:26.420]   He loves mr. Laport by really
[02:18:26.420 --> 02:18:30.420]   Several occasions. Yeah, we've had some great conversations. He used to be at our this weekend
[02:18:31.060 --> 02:18:36.260]   Uh, or uh, what do we call it? I can't even remember was it this weekend photos or google a twit photos something like that
[02:18:36.260 --> 02:18:38.660]   Thank you. It's with photos. Yeah
[02:18:38.660 --> 02:18:43.380]   Uh, he's a great great photographer and i'm really good person too. So that I will try to do that
[02:18:43.380 --> 02:18:50.740]   Thank you aunt. Do you have a number for us? Uh, I do so so let's require a few tears for google
[02:18:50.740 --> 02:18:58.500]   The ad according to e marketer the ad giants us digital ad revenue will this year predicted to decline
[02:18:58.900 --> 02:19:02.340]   For the first times this e marketer has predicted google's money
[02:19:02.340 --> 02:19:05.060]   By 5.3 percent
[02:19:05.060 --> 02:19:07.460]   239.6 billion
[02:19:07.460 --> 02:19:12.980]   It had been projected by e marketer to increase by 12.9 billion. That is covet for you folks
[02:19:12.980 --> 02:19:16.340]   Um, their market share will shrink
[02:19:16.340 --> 02:19:22.340]   From 31.6 to 29.4. Which is a fairly big deal
[02:19:22.340 --> 02:19:25.460]   meanwhile
[02:19:25.460 --> 02:19:27.220]   Amazon and
[02:19:27.220 --> 02:19:29.220]   Facebook will still go up
[02:19:29.220 --> 02:19:34.980]   Amazon's revenue will grow by just 4.9 percent this year compared to 21 percent last year
[02:19:34.980 --> 02:19:42.820]   Amazon will grow by 23 compared to 39 percent last year really you would think amazon would have been a big windfall for them
[02:19:42.820 --> 02:19:46.500]   ad ad revenue ad revenue ad is all rather than
[02:19:46.500 --> 02:19:52.420]   It's all rather so add you know, let's forget that amazon is new to the ad business right relatively speaking. Okay
[02:19:52.420 --> 02:19:55.140]   so in that um
[02:19:55.220 --> 02:19:59.380]   Uh, so google's market share, you know, it was always a monopoly
[02:19:59.380 --> 02:20:02.180]   Google's market share goes down to 29.4 percent
[02:20:02.180 --> 02:20:04.980]   Facebook's
[02:20:04.980 --> 02:20:11.460]   Is going to be at 23.4 percent and amazon is going to be at 9.5
[02:20:11.460 --> 02:20:21.460]   That doesn't make up folks that's 23 and 10 that's 33 plus that's something like, I don't know 647
[02:20:22.660 --> 02:20:25.140]   Um, wow, so that's 30 percent
[02:20:25.140 --> 02:20:29.220]   Uh 55 percent 65 that's that's so the three of them together
[02:20:29.220 --> 02:20:35.140]   Are in the 60s of I think jeez percent a market share and so that means there's a lot
[02:20:35.140 --> 02:20:39.300]   There's another third of the market that's out there. Thank goodness all that revenue is flowing to twit
[02:20:39.300 --> 02:20:42.660]   Yeah
[02:20:42.660 --> 02:20:48.740]   Have you calculated your market share Leo? Uh, no, it's probably about there enough zeros probably
[02:20:49.860 --> 02:20:56.340]   zero zero zero. Yeah, it's actually not that bad. I think uh this year we're going to be down
[02:20:56.340 --> 02:21:02.420]   Well, it's the years not over yet, but uh, we're saying think in 25 30 down
[02:21:02.420 --> 02:21:05.300]   I know it's a lot
[02:21:05.300 --> 02:21:10.580]   Um, but it's not not too much for us to weather I think unless it gets worse, which it could very easily do
[02:21:10.580 --> 02:21:14.820]   You could but we are getting it done. Thank you
[02:21:14.820 --> 02:21:21.700]   Thanks to people like you and our great team and dano and max and sales and of course mostly thanks to lisa
[02:21:21.700 --> 02:21:26.420]   My wife who busts her and I think I think the you know like you were talking before we were on the air
[02:21:26.420 --> 02:21:28.660]   There's a marketer who wants to come back and lisa sand
[02:21:28.660 --> 02:21:32.660]   It's got the right time for you, but they're all going to have to start advertising again
[02:21:32.660 --> 02:21:34.420]   They're going to have to find ways
[02:21:34.420 --> 02:21:41.700]   Well, you know it's such an unknown because it really also depends on what's consumer spending going to be like this quarter and yes, right?
[02:21:41.700 --> 02:21:45.140]   Yeah, no, uh and and you know some of these
[02:21:45.140 --> 02:21:52.580]   We're fortunate because we have a diverse number of advertisers and some of them are an enterprise some other and consumer and so
[02:21:52.580 --> 02:21:57.300]   You know different sectors are affected differently. Obviously zoom's doing fine
[02:21:57.300 --> 02:22:03.220]   So, but we're surviving we're hanging in there. I thought it was going to be worse to be honest with you
[02:22:03.220 --> 02:22:05.700]   Yeah, yeah
[02:22:05.700 --> 02:22:07.620]   I did too. Yeah
[02:22:07.620 --> 02:22:11.940]   I think we lost about I don't know something like three million in revenue this year something like that
[02:22:11.940 --> 02:22:17.060]   That's a lot. I mean, that's a big number. It's not like I was putting three million in my pocket
[02:22:17.060 --> 02:22:21.620]   I mean that has to come out of something right? Yep, and no just kidding
[02:22:21.620 --> 02:22:26.500]   Should not do that should not do that this time we are gonna
[02:22:26.500 --> 02:22:29.940]   He's me and tell you about the yacht you were he promised you the yacht
[02:22:29.940 --> 02:22:32.580]   It's just no more yachts. No
[02:22:32.580 --> 02:22:34.820]   No, no, no
[02:22:34.820 --> 02:22:40.740]   So I don't think you we've all been talking about hey dot com david henna my hair hansen and jason frees
[02:22:40.740 --> 02:22:47.540]   Kind of take on email. We talked about it last week got him in trouble with apple got him kicked him out of the apple store
[02:22:47.540 --> 02:22:51.220]   It's back in now. I finally got my invite a few days ago
[02:22:51.220 --> 02:22:57.860]   So I thought I'd set this up actually I think I set it up yesterday and show you a little bit about how it's a different take on email
[02:22:57.860 --> 02:23:02.660]   Um, the first thing so first thing you notice is the typo on inbox
[02:23:02.820 --> 02:23:05.540]   It's supposed to be in box. I don't know why
[02:23:05.540 --> 02:23:08.580]   But it is
[02:23:08.580 --> 02:23:10.580]   It has some interesting features box
[02:23:10.580 --> 02:23:17.780]   I'm box. I don't know they explain it somewhere. I couldn't be bothered to read crawfish crayfish crawfish
[02:23:17.780 --> 02:23:23.060]   Don't call the whole thing. I have my email from leo ville forwarding here not all of it
[02:23:23.060 --> 02:23:27.380]   But some of it so notice screen seven first time centers
[02:23:27.380 --> 02:23:31.540]   So the first time anybody sends you an email you get a list of them
[02:23:32.260 --> 02:23:34.260]   and you decide
[02:23:34.260 --> 02:23:36.660]   Up or down
[02:23:36.660 --> 02:23:40.980]   So like I don't want to get any more from slack connect
[02:23:40.980 --> 02:23:44.260]   Uh, I don't want to get any more
[02:23:44.260 --> 02:23:49.140]   Well, it'll be crushing for somebody. This is going to be bad steven. I know
[02:23:49.140 --> 02:23:56.340]   So you say yes or no, obviously lisa. I want to get no more from town. I won't be going anymore cruises
[02:23:56.340 --> 02:23:59.380]   Uh, here's a listener. Okay. I'm gonna say yes to him
[02:24:00.100 --> 02:24:02.740]   I don't want to get my infinity bill anymore
[02:24:02.740 --> 02:24:09.060]   Unfortunately, I still have to pay I mean either. Yeah, and I think mark. Okay. So now they're gone into my inbox
[02:24:09.060 --> 02:24:11.060]   But there's still lots of things I can do
[02:24:11.060 --> 02:24:17.140]   For instance, I I can see my screened out stuff so it's not gone forever, right?
[02:24:17.140 --> 02:24:18.340]   But
[02:24:18.340 --> 02:24:22.500]   If that any of these sent another email it won't it'll go in a screened
[02:24:22.500 --> 02:24:25.700]   It won't go into my inbox or my im box
[02:24:26.740 --> 02:24:32.500]   Is general spam going to screened or just the things that you goes into spam and I am not getting any spam right now
[02:24:32.500 --> 02:24:34.660]   But I'm sure I will I'm not done
[02:24:34.660 --> 02:24:36.020]   Um
[02:24:36.020 --> 02:24:40.740]   So I can see my inbox notice there are key strokes for all of these you'd never have to use the mouse ever
[02:24:40.740 --> 02:24:44.820]   There's a paper trail, which is interesting if you get receipts
[02:24:44.820 --> 02:24:50.580]   Confirmations or whatever you just say that's paper trail and they'll go into this folder
[02:24:50.580 --> 02:24:56.500]   Some of that automatically anywhere anytime I get marketing or newsletters that goes into the feed
[02:24:56.580 --> 02:25:00.260]   So this is some of that stuff that gmail was doing a little bit of
[02:25:00.260 --> 02:25:04.180]   I love the set aside. So I can go back to
[02:25:04.180 --> 02:25:06.340]   something here
[02:25:06.340 --> 02:25:08.420]   Uh and say oh, you know, I really
[02:25:08.420 --> 02:25:12.580]   Okay, this is a tutorial which is popped up
[02:25:12.580 --> 02:25:17.940]   Oh interesting. So you can say this is from person something I might reply to or something I want
[02:25:17.940 --> 02:25:20.660]   Newsletter. This is receipt. No, this is from a person
[02:25:20.660 --> 02:25:24.900]   So they're going to keep it in the inbox, but I'm also going to say
[02:25:25.860 --> 02:25:28.020]   reply later. I like that feature
[02:25:28.020 --> 02:25:36.100]   So it is going to collect on this focus and reply so I can do it later, which I think is really a little better than flagging
[02:25:36.100 --> 02:25:40.340]   It's the same idea. I can also let's see here's one set aside
[02:25:40.340 --> 02:25:43.540]   Now mark don't get hurt because I'm just going to set this one aside right now
[02:25:43.540 --> 02:25:47.700]   And set aside is something for reference
[02:25:47.700 --> 02:25:54.740]   But it's it's going to always be easy access down here at the bottom, which is kind of interesting
[02:25:55.300 --> 02:25:56.420]   Okay
[02:25:56.420 --> 02:26:01.140]   So it is designed to quickly triage email and to get less email
[02:26:01.140 --> 02:26:06.580]   There's also labels that you can use and then uh, I'll create a label right now
[02:26:06.580 --> 02:26:09.460]   We'll just show you and we'll call it taxes
[02:26:09.460 --> 02:26:13.860]   And now I have a taxes label, which I can add
[02:26:13.860 --> 02:26:18.420]   Uh, you see it's showing up at my label list anytime i'm looking at an email
[02:26:18.420 --> 02:26:21.940]   So the idea is to quickly be able to process email
[02:26:22.420 --> 02:26:26.340]   It will take all the attachments and put them in this all files folder
[02:26:26.340 --> 02:26:31.540]   I think this is kind of nice. These guys are good at web design. You see how clean and easy it is
[02:26:31.540 --> 02:26:37.060]   I'm sorry. It's in dark mode. Oh, is there a lot of going to ask? Yeah, so this is dark mode. Let me just turn that off
[02:26:37.060 --> 02:26:43.060]   Uh, yeah, I'm sorry. I think actually it's getting that for you. No Leo. You know it's getting that from the operating system
[02:26:43.060 --> 02:26:45.060]   I think is where that's getting from
[02:26:45.060 --> 02:26:46.820]   um
[02:26:46.820 --> 02:26:49.860]   Now it'll be a hundred dollars a month. I mean a year. Sorry a year
[02:26:50.260 --> 02:26:57.700]   A hundred dollars a year. Not bad, but not you know, not great. They also plan. Yeah, unfortunately my email address is
[02:26:57.700 --> 02:27:00.260]   At hay.com
[02:27:00.260 --> 02:27:06.420]   Chief to it at hay.com and right now there's no way to change that event. I'm forwarding it for my leo ville
[02:27:06.420 --> 02:27:10.020]   So that works. Okay, but eventually I'd like to be able to give it my own address
[02:27:10.020 --> 02:27:14.020]   They are going to charge if you want if I wanted leo at hay.com
[02:27:14.020 --> 02:27:16.500]   That would cost me I think $600 a year
[02:27:16.500 --> 02:27:21.300]   And if I wanted ll two letters at hay.com a thousand dollars a year
[02:27:21.300 --> 02:27:28.020]   But the money is all going to dane golden. I think so it's good our former producer who used to own hay.com
[02:27:28.020 --> 02:27:32.420]   Uh, they bought an unnamed but apparently large amount of money
[02:27:32.420 --> 02:27:36.420]   Uh, he was one of our early days got the yach. Danes got the yacht
[02:27:36.420 --> 02:27:42.340]   So I you know, I like this. I don't know if i'll go crazy over it. I'm not you know, I have two weeks to try it
[02:27:42.980 --> 02:27:47.780]   Uh, I don't know if it's yet, uh available to everyone. I applied for a
[02:27:47.780 --> 02:27:50.580]   And and you have to have a code at all
[02:27:50.580 --> 02:27:54.580]   If you want to get a code, you've got to send them an email telling what your mom's right?
[02:27:54.580 --> 02:27:55.780]   I did that
[02:27:55.780 --> 02:27:59.780]   Next month they say they're going to open it to everyone. So I guess this is an early beta
[02:27:59.780 --> 02:28:07.060]   They do if you go to hay.com you can read all about it. You can find out all the details how it works and all that stuff
[02:28:07.060 --> 02:28:12.100]   Uh, and I you know, honestly, these are the guys that did base camp. They know what they're doing
[02:28:12.580 --> 02:28:17.460]   They have apps for uh, iOS android mac windows linux
[02:28:17.460 --> 02:28:20.500]   Um, they have a lot of interesting features
[02:28:20.500 --> 02:28:26.020]   I I look I want to celebrate the attempt to fix email, right? Yeah
[02:28:26.020 --> 02:28:31.460]   Um because oh him stands for important or immediate and get it. Okay
[02:28:31.460 --> 02:28:34.580]   So I I admire that attempt
[02:28:34.580 --> 02:28:39.140]   By the way, they block all trackers, which is fantastic
[02:28:39.700 --> 02:28:44.340]   And they even tell you hey, you know this email this had a you know invisible tracker in it
[02:28:44.340 --> 02:28:47.300]   You should know about that on a tracking pixels. Yep
[02:28:47.300 --> 02:28:50.500]   So anytime an email wants to phone home
[02:28:50.500 --> 02:28:54.340]   It'll tell you which is really really good
[02:28:54.340 --> 02:29:01.380]   You can uh change the thread and the email but but it will continue to work as if you hadn't which I think is nice
[02:29:01.380 --> 02:29:07.140]   I often get email all stacked together because it had the same subject line and I don't like that subject line. So
[02:29:07.140 --> 02:29:09.540]   there's a lot of ways
[02:29:09.620 --> 02:29:11.620]   That this is trying to solve
[02:29:11.620 --> 02:29:16.500]   A lot of issues. I'm going to get keep with it for a couple of weeks because it may in fact
[02:29:16.500 --> 02:29:19.860]   I like some of the things they're doing. I really do
[02:29:19.860 --> 02:29:25.460]   So but when you reply you're replying from the head. Yeah, unfortunately. That's kind of a bummer
[02:29:25.460 --> 02:29:30.580]   Because that's not my email address. That's you know, but I think that so it's gonna look strange too
[02:29:30.580 --> 02:29:35.620]   So it's gonna look like spam to me. Right. Yes. You're gonna say who can be about the forever sending any email. Yeah
[02:29:36.420 --> 02:29:38.580]   Now kevin roe seems to like it
[02:29:38.580 --> 02:29:41.940]   As is ryan hoover
[02:29:41.940 --> 02:29:44.020]   So, you know interesting
[02:29:44.020 --> 02:29:46.100]   Inhale body
[02:29:46.100 --> 02:29:51.700]   Yeah, wonderful guy. Oh no, they got look at the anti bio from uh, uh, you know max pancake. So
[02:29:51.700 --> 02:29:54.980]   I feel like
[02:29:54.980 --> 02:29:59.060]   I want to I love these guys. I think Jason and david are very very smart
[02:29:59.060 --> 02:30:00.580]   And
[02:30:00.580 --> 02:30:04.420]   I think their take on email is quite interesting. It isn't you know
[02:30:05.140 --> 02:30:09.540]   The same thing is what gmail's tried to do or outlook with the focused inbox
