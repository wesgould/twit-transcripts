[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:42.360]   He's the no much more dignified Leonard Ta Provester for journalistic innovation at the Craig No Mark graduate school of journalism
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.800]   At the City University of New York, but MSNBC couldn't fit that in the lower third
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.840]   They apparently didn't have the technology we have
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.240]   So they called him when he appeared on MSNBC yesterday with Katie tour former TV guide critic
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.480]   Which is about is I mean and blogger. I mean as bad as low as you can go
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.720]   And sometimes Twitter
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.680]   Podcaster that's as low. Oh, yeah, that's true bloggers
[00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.680]   Step above podcaster. Hey, not anymore podcaster hot. Don't you know that?
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:21.160]   Tons of podcast news, but before we do that one go ahead
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:25.840]   We have a special guest in the studio
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.760]   The roadie magic is here
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:39.840]   Is her credit I think I deserve credit for introducing the roadie magic to the show this is okay to the show but
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.640]   But I knew about it when you introduced it. She knew about it already. I knew about that
[00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:50.060]   I beat you and then I brought I brought a video to the show and I tasted the rotis and I
[00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.320]   Told Leo he had to try it this
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:56.120]   Is was this a Kickstarter or something?
[00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.440]   Because it's it was it it seems like a very odd thing to
[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.680]   Do so the founders the two founders?
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.400]   They just wanted a way to eat rotis without having to do it
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.200]   Like having to make them every day
[00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.760]   The old-fashioned way
[00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:21.920]   The old-fashioned way because they I mean it is hard to puff them up properly and whatnot. Yeah, it's I think it's a husband and wife team
[00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:26.600]   Well, one of the founders wrote in on LinkedIn his story. He said
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:32.560]   There there's an automated way to wash clothes make bread and watch dishes. Why can't there be one to make rotis?
[00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.720]   And that's when this why I'm hearing myself
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:45.280]   That was when the spark first lit he was doing his yoda before folks. He was a mechanical engineer
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:50.480]   I worked in robotics and so he it's actually quite complicated if in fact we
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.560]   Is a super compilary. Should we make some roti?
[00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:54.800]   Yeah
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:00.120]   All right, can you make some non and some pita too? I think any flatbread right Stacy?
[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:05.840]   You could make any flatbread and they're adapting for different recipes. So it gets constant updates not
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:12.160]   With new flowers and that sort of thing has an led on it says starting up and then I open the tray
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:16.160]   And then the little roti medic pushers is getting ready
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.880]   To do its thing
[00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.080]   You could see in the top there is a canister for flour
[00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:29.680]   Water and oil right I think that third one is oil and um, it says set preferences tap play
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.160]   So first thing I have to do is decide
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.880]   Hey, you know, it says it's how many rotis do I wash my washing machine says play
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.880]   Four all right. We're gonna make the maximum number
[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.920]   It says zero out of four. How do I
[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:50.480]   That is okay. You've got it's making four. It just hasn't made it yet. Oh, I get it
[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:54.320]   So it's going to make four I can choose the thickness the roast level
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:06:00.320]   How much oil and then I press yes play. Do you want to start making roti you bet
[00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:05.120]   It is now it says I'm learn I'm a learning machine and I'm adapting
[00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:09.760]   During the first few rotis your roti will get even better with time
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:13.040]   So cool
[00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.840]   So it means it's sending your data to the cloud
[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:18.400]   Is it cool Jeff?
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:21.280]   Well, my brody privacy has been reached
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:28.000]   Roti panic. I'm not saying I'm just pointing out everyone's like, oh, that's so cool. I'm like, yeah, but now something's lowering
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.200]   It's kind of noisy
[00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:37.680]   It because it's like a 3d printer. I mean go go into that like so when I shot my roti video
[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:41.440]   It go into that side thing because you can actually look in the window
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:44.240]   Yeah, look in the little window. You can see it
[00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:47.920]   Carol Merrill is opening the door now
[00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:51.440]   And so this is the kneading device. So
[00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:56.400]   Right now it's it's a mixing together oil water and flour
[00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:00.720]   They sent us some special kind of indian hole wheat
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:07.520]   That is a I guess popular for roti making and now in a minute. It's gonna pop a little
[00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:13.040]   Ball out right all the dough out ball of dough and it's gonna need it on that thing
[00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:16.880]   Feels like is this stuck?
[00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:19.840]   No, it takes a minute
[00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:24.480]   It's got to warm up and do all kinds of things. Oops. My side door seems to be open. We just have to
[00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:32.160]   Say it wouldn't like that. Yeah, it's because it could fire roti balls across the room that would not be good
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:36.320]   Warming up five minutes remaining. Well, we'll come back. Yeah, I think
[00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:39.360]   Because I also got something else today
[00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:43.520]   Well, wait, you should tell do you want to tell people how much it is before they know
[00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:48.080]   $1000
[00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:50.720]   But it's got to be selling like crazy because
[00:07:51.440 --> 00:07:55.360]   If you go to the roadie mad excite, they say how many rotis have been made
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:08:01.600]   And it's millions. Let's go see what the current roadie madick uh roti count is
[00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:08.560]   Oh, did they stop doing the count? Oh? Oh they did well privacy. Maybe i'm not on the front
[00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:10.800]   Yeah, right
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:12.800]   Oh, no, here it is 43 million
[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:20.640]   746,000 and 79 rotis and look at yours will be there soon. It'll be right in there. See how fast it's like a roti a second
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:22.960]   as being made right now
[00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:27.920]   So I figured they sold a few rotations. Oh, is something happening?
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:31.600]   No, that's just I saw the video. Yeah, you thought it was real
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:34.400]   but as soon as it comes out, uh,
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:40.320]   We'll we'll cut away to the ball drops. It's kind of like uh, I feel like walter cronkite
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:42.160]   We're on hold with the roti maker
[00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:46.880]   But as soon as the roti comes into the chamber. We will cut away
[00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:49.680]   to the roti mad
[00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:56.800]   Is the anniversary of his last television broadcast today is the 30th anniversary of of uncle hula walter's
[00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:59.760]   Last broadcast is it
[00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:05.840]   From the university of texas. Yeah, it's it's funny. I it seems like it's longer ago than 30 years
[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:08.480]   That was his last cbs evening news
[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:14.240]   Yes with walter cronkite. I interviewed him after he retired he was into sailing
[00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:16.960]   And he had done a beautiful
[00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:24.160]   I hear something coffee table book of uh sailing and sailing ships. He was really great
[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:27.760]   Um
[00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:32.960]   All your actions gonna be in that side window that side window. Yeah, Anthony is waiting to uh to peer in
[00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:38.320]   I got half a little bit and then after after it gets dough after it needs the dough
[00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:42.880]   He's gonna pop it into that front area. So can you open can you have the door open?
[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:47.360]   No, no, you can't you have to just uh enjoy it from afar
[00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:50.320]   Because then you get like dirt and stuff
[00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:52.960]   But you'll be able to like I do through the window
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:58.480]   So do you think it's uh home users or I bet you it's it's restaurants mostly the bison?
[00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:01.040]   No, it's got to be home users. There's a very strong. I mean
[00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:06.960]   It's a pretty big limit. No home users. I wonder whether there's a roti madik and google
[00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:09.920]   Oh, yeah, that oh that's where you put it
[00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:13.600]   Uh quite a few
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:17.440]   They make rotis all the time. I've made a rhodi. I made rhodi. I made non
[00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:20.560]   It's you making the in this cast iron still
[00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:24.240]   Define the difference between the various flatbreads
[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:29.200]   A rhodi is characterized as what versus a non versus a
[00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:32.000]   I feel like rhodi is the generic
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.480]   It's the rhodi is the tortilla
[00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:41.840]   No one is like a focache. It's a non is it's much thicker and how what is it compare a rhodi to a chapati?
[00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:49.520]   Chapati is a rhodi. They are rhodis. Yeah, it's like a crisp. It's like a tortilla versus a tortilla chip
[00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:51.920]   So rhodi is a tortilla chip rhodi or flatbread
[00:10:51.920 --> 00:11:00.400]   Then yeah, they're like tortillas. But but it's tortillas. Well, the non that I made you let it rise and so it's puffier
[00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:03.200]   and uh you cook it
[00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:08.480]   When the roti mattick it'll actually puff up you want your roti to puff. Yes
[00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:11.760]   So you get some air and lightness in there
[00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:14.400]   Okay
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:17.680]   I'm a big non fan. I presume I could make non with this
[00:11:17.680 --> 00:11:23.360]   Or maybe not maybe it's got to be flatter. I think you can't know I think i think we determined before you can make lots of
[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:25.920]   You can make little pizzas
[00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:29.280]   Yeah, they do I think it's only frat flatbread right now
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:37.760]   Thickness setting so you you can make rhodi puri pizza. You can make you can make puris down puris. It says yeah
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:40.960]   Those are fried
[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:44.640]   Aren't those are what am I thinking of maybe yeah? No, I think you're right. Maybe you take it out and fry it
[00:11:44.640 --> 00:11:48.960]   Maybe just makes the boy my favorite indian product or idlies
[00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:55.200]   You know the sad irony is I picked a terrible day to give up carbohydrates
[00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:04.640]   Sad irony of this is it's going to make something I can't eat but that's life
[00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:07.920]   Uh you can send it to me. Oh
[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:11.440]   As a matter of fact
[00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:13.680]   I have a federal express envelope
[00:12:13.680 --> 00:12:19.200]   Waiting just see if it is to go out and that I'll mail one to you too jeff if you want
[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:24.800]   Uh, yeah, uh, I doubt that it has a little tree. Well overnight it
[00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:33.920]   No, there's definitely gluten in this one. So the other thing I got maybe more germane to twig is the galaxy s 10 plus has arrived
[00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:36.480]   Ah
[00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:38.560]   I was surprised. I didn't expect it to get it this soon
[00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:41.920]   Uh and it came with the buds which are kind of cute
[00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:48.400]   And uh, so I if you look at it, this is this is basically a um
[00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:51.040]   Yeah, there you go. You can see it
[00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:56.480]   It's basically the same size a little smaller than the note nine you could see the whole punch for the cameras
[00:12:56.480 --> 00:13:02.080]   And the thing that's interesting about the as 10 has three cameras on the back
[00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:05.200]   Uh kind of wide medium and telephoto
[00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:09.280]   And uh, and this by the way, this is the ceramic back so
[00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:16.480]   Uh, because I want I thought well, what if you what if you decide to spend as much possible as much money as possible on this thing
[00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:20.960]   How high how high could you go? So this has a terabyte of storage
[00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:27.280]   Plus I put a card in there. So more than a terabyte of storage. It has 12 gigs of ram
[00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:31.360]   It's the highest, uh, specked samsung galaxy 10
[00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:35.280]   And it has a ceramic back they have white and black ceramic backs
[00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:40.320]   Um, but i'll show you the you want to see the fingerprint reader in action. So you see it puts a little thing
[00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:42.880]   on the front there. This is a
[00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:46.880]   um, uh, not an optical fingerprint reader or a capacitive like on
[00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:49.760]   the old samsung phones. It's a, um
[00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:53.680]   Let's keep it awake. Actually, I guess I don't have to because you can see the little
[00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:57.920]   Thing there. It's uh ultrasound. So in theory
[00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:00.800]   Whoa cool
[00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:02.800]   Is it unlocked? No match
[00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:06.880]   No match. Oh, we're gonna have to interrupt this with a very important message
[00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:09.440]   from roadie madik
[00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:13.360]   I heard something
[00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:15.360]   Oh, something's something going in
[00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:19.200]   It's happening zoom in on that window zoom in on the window. Come on, Anthony. Oh
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:22.080]   It's moving. Oh
[00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:23.920]   Is a ball
[00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:25.920]   Is there is it needing
[00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:27.920]   Is the ball in there yet?
[00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:31.120]   I don't know. This is there are so many parts in this thing
[00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:34.080]   This is so complicated and it sounds frankly
[00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:38.400]   Here it comes. Yes. So what happens the ball is gonna form right there
[00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:43.440]   Okay, what's going on? I don't know
[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:47.520]   So it's it's okay. There's the flower. Oh, so it's mixing
[00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:54.400]   Okay, so most of that weight was probably just getting the the element to heat up so it could cook it right? So it's mixing the dough
[00:14:54.400 --> 00:14:58.400]   Uh, is adding now probably the water and oil
[00:14:58.400 --> 00:15:03.440]   Uh mixing yeah, see there you go now it's now it's gonna need it
[00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:08.080]   And it's gonna turn into it takes a lot of time. It takes a long not a long time
[00:15:08.080 --> 00:15:10.880]   But it's kind of crazy to watch it like so we're gonna make four
[00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:16.000]   But uh, does it have to do this each time? I guess it does it does it individually
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.960]   So really if you had a family of four you'd be waiting
[00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:20.720]   quite a while
[00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:22.720]   For a minute to get a roadie
[00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:29.680]   Once it's warmed up. It's I think it's one roadie per minute a roadie a minute. Okay. Okay. So
[00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:33.760]   Um, it takes longer than that for me to you know, make waffles in my waffle
[00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:35.760]   Yeah, yeah
[00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:40.720]   And and so do you would you like having any in dinner and then make roadie a fresh roadie?
[00:15:40.720 --> 00:15:42.320]   That would be kind of fun wouldn't it?
[00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:44.960]   And certainly it's a it's an attraction for all
[00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:48.000]   And you can make tortillas with it
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.040]   Yeah, it was not your listley. Oh right tortillas
[00:15:51.040 --> 00:15:57.280]   Yeah, no, but I think now Anthony how hard is this to clean? It's got a special roadie cleaning stick
[00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:04.880]   All the compartments are dishwasher safe. Oh, so you could take it apart. You can wash it. Okay
[00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:08.320]   I'm sorry, Anthony. Would you like to answer? Oh, look at that
[00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:10.880]   See here's the ball
[00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:14.720]   Up we lost a little dough inside there now. Oh
[00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:17.440]   Okay now go to the front go to the front
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:21.680]   No, quick switch to the front here comes it's going to come out of the front Anthony
[00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:24.800]   Go go switch to the switch to the
[00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:27.360]   Switch to the toaster cam
[00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:31.280]   Anthony Anthony's a perfectionist. You didn't want to move while we were on him
[00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:37.920]   And then we're gonna go down so you can see what's happening. So it's gonna pull this guy up
[00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:41.040]   This is good. I don't even think msnbc could give you this kind of coverage
[00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:46.560]   There oh there it is. Is that heated? It's gonna hang out there. It's heating it right now and it's gonna
[00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:49.280]   This is the puffing. This is the puffing
[00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:55.280]   This is where it's how does it puff it is it with heat it puffs it or it's heat. It's just the heat
[00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:59.520]   Um, would you call this?
[00:16:59.520 --> 00:17:05.840]   Yes, it's needing number two as it's uh as it's cooking number one. So that's why it's gonna get to one a minute
[00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:08.080]   Oh look it's popping up. Yeah
[00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:10.880]   Oh there goes and it goes whoosh
[00:17:10.880 --> 00:17:16.240]   Is this uh is this said you think it's this would this kind of categorized as artificial intelligence
[00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:23.120]   Artificial baking no because it doesn't learn it was hasn't learned actually
[00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:28.000]   But it doesn't learn how to do it properly. This isn't actually doing. Oh my god. It's beautiful
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.640]   Puff look at that. Oh
[00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:32.800]   Oh now it's now
[00:17:32.800 --> 00:17:34.800]   Now quick before it
[00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:37.520]   Cool
[00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:42.960]   Wait
[00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:46.480]   Okay
[00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:48.720]   You'll be getting that tomorrow morning
[00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:51.520]   Stacey and and i'll do one for jeff too
[00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:57.200]   That's fresh uh you can't get any fresh in that
[00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:00.320]   sealed
[00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:02.320]   fresh
[00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:04.320]   I can't wait
[00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:06.800]   I
[00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:11.200]   Was supposed I was supposed to use the tongs. I apologize, but my hands are clean
[00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:14.720]   That's okay. I'm sure my FedEx truck and
[00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:22.080]   Okay, here comes another one. Here comes another one another roadie is about to emerge. What do you speak?
[00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:28.160]   Get me jerry. Would you get me another FedEx bag? We got someone to jeff as well
[00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:31.200]   And then since we're making four we'll give our studio audience
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:37.600]   All of you you get a roadie and you get a roadie and you and you and you and you get a roadie everybody. It's Oprah
[00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:43.520]   Oprah roadie. Okay, there's two people in the audience now you bro. You're busted busted
[00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:46.160]   Okay
[00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:49.680]   Um quick get me that bag. This roadie's about to emerge. It's getting puffed
[00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:56.320]   It's getting puffed. I don't want it to get stay. Oh here we go. Okay. Okay. We got the FedEx bag. All right. Okay
[00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:04.320]   I do love how it looks like an actual printer. You're like it sounds like a printer. It sounds like a 3d printer
[00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:05.680]   This thing has got
[00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:07.680]   Worrying and clicking and buzzing
[00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:10.960]   It reminds me when I was a kid and I had a and I wrote there was a book
[00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:15.040]   Remember this book about do you remember the do you ever read your daughter a book about a donut making machine?
[00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:18.160]   It's like uh bartholumumacubbons or something
[00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:26.160]   Here comes who comes who comes very exciting very exciting. This is yours jeff. That's got your name written all over. Oh, it's beautiful
[00:19:26.160 --> 00:19:28.720]   I think I see the face of uh, jesus in it
[00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:33.120]   Who's gonna say mary or jesus? Oh jeff you got tongs
[00:19:33.120 --> 00:19:36.640]   Wow
[00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:38.880]   Nice
[00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:43.200]   There it is going there go to the courier. I think we made I think we made FedEx
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:46.720]   Here do every window
[00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:50.080]   And then the next two are for you
[00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:52.320]   Okay
[00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:57.520]   Yeah, just wheeled wheeled that off. Yeah, we need to take those. They should ask why um
[00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:03.600]   They're the second, you know because really they should have gotten the first ones and options really for the next ones that came out
[00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:08.160]   No, because you're the hosts and I wanted you to have the freshest
[00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:10.480]   Eliteism
[00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:12.160]   Primarily freshest
[00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:17.840]   There we go. Anyway, I I just got this Samsung. So I really can't do a review the fingerprint
[00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:22.960]   Everybody has said is not as fast as a capacitive fingerprint, but it does work
[00:20:23.520 --> 00:20:30.960]   It also has face ID which works and you know, if you really if it all breaks down you can go back to the old androids, you know
[00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:33.440]   Dot pattern
[00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:39.120]   Is it better front or back for the fingerprint you think in the end uh, I never I never liked it in the in
[00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:43.680]   I liked how pixel did it but never liked how samsung did it because if you look at the uh
[00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:48.560]   This is a note nine and if you look at where the fingerprint reader is on the note nine
[00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:54.400]   It's a little bit better than the note eight which was right next to the camera, but it's close to the camera
[00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:57.280]   And so it's not it's not ideal and if it's on a
[00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:02.480]   The charging stand or on its back you have to pick it up to charge to unlock it
[00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:06.720]   So I think it's a better spot, but I think this the ultrasonic technology is
[00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:14.720]   Uh, it's pretty early. Nevertheless beautiful screen. I mean you could see that immediately. Where is it? There is beautiful screen
[00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:17.040]   Um, that is pretty yeah
[00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:18.960]   Uh, is that like louise
[00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:20.960]   I believe it is in beautiful bimps. Okay
[00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:26.000]   It's very snappy as you can see. I've fact, uh, yes
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.640]   It's kind of thing where you just keep it and stuff until it
[00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:32.480]   Until it calms down a little bit, uh, feels pretty fast
[00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:35.600]   But so when the next thing I'm going to do is try to fill up a terabyte of storage
[00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:40.400]   Which means I probably can get every audiobook i've ever purchased since the year 2000
[00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:43.680]   Plus every song I own digitized on here
[00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:46.320]   Which makes this kind of fun
[00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:52.560]   Ooh, what about why would you not use video you could get I can also use it should I uh, yeah
[00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:56.960]   We could fill it up faster. Well, that's been certainly my problem. There's all security now's
[00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:00.080]   so I
[00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:04.160]   Uh, actually I shouldn't do that. I my it just said oh you have an SD card
[00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:05.360]   You want us to save your video there?
[00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:09.760]   But no I don't because I've got so much internal storage. I can save it there
[00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:15.600]   Um, it's this typical Samsung camera. Should we do an AR? Are you ready for the case test? Are we?
[00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:18.880]   Uh, should we do I can't I can't
[00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:26.320]   You have two people in the studio audience. We're gonna have to ask Omar and Sarah to taste it. Okay, are they okay giving their opinions on the air
[00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:29.120]   Did you ask them?
[00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:31.120]   Are you okay giving your opinions on the air?
[00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:33.760]   GDPR
[00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:38.720]   Do you mind if we we share images of your face with the world
[00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:43.520]   At any medium thereafter. They already signed that it's too late. Oh, they're
[00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:49.840]   Yeah, any universe. Okay. We actually I'm trying to be polite. No, that's good. If I were there with my daughter
[00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:54.800]   I would not want to come on your these people are adults and they've already signed away their lives
[00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:57.360]   And they've already signed away
[00:22:57.360 --> 00:23:04.240]   So we're reminding not to bring my daughter to the studio. Yeah. Well, you have to sign for her because she's not
[00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:08.800]   She's not a baby. Yeah, well, I and I wouldn't so she'd have to like stand at the door looking in
[00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:10.320]   Oh
[00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:15.600]   We're getting this new thing a new sponsor called envoy where they have a you know, you've done that like okay give that to
[00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:21.440]   Sarah wait, it might be a little hot might be a little hot. Oh, there's two of them. Okay. Omar and Sarah
[00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:28.320]   You get to taste the roti and give us your professional roti taster opinion
[00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:34.720]   She has a glute analogy. She can't eat it. Omar. They're all for you. Can you eat him?
[00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:40.400]   Yeah, he says I lean him. It's hot. Careful. Okay. Do you want to give him some butter or something?
[00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:42.960]   No, you eat it dry
[00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:45.200]   Chutney. Oh, we want some chutney now
[00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:51.680]   No, just take it to new tell us the way to do it. Yeah, just a taste. Omar. Just to see is this as good as mothers
[00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:54.640]   Moms roti
[00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:56.640]   Better better. You like it?
[00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:59.920]   Yeah, it was made by a machine
[00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:04.640]   They do have gluten free flour option. Your mom is now replaced
[00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:07.840]   Yeah, you could probably make it with almond flour or one of the other
[00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:14.160]   It's a $1,000 replacement, which is expensive, but cheaper than mom's don't come cheap. Yeah
[00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:22.720]   Okay, they got it. They got there. We have a very big story today. You know, what's the big story today?
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:26.320]   Uh, Facebook convinced the privacy
[00:24:26.320 --> 00:24:28.560]   Oh
[00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:31.440]   Okay, let's talk about it. Let's talk about it. I will
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:37.280]   Yeah, we should do that and I want to the the corollary to this is Facebook wants to become a bank
[00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:39.760]   Oh, let's find that story
[00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:45.200]   Both Facebook and apple actually are starting to look like that apple dutta deal with goldman sacks to do a credit card
[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:49.040]   Which I think is a first step towards doing its own bank here is uh
[00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:52.800]   Alex stamos's insta reaction
[00:24:52.800 --> 00:25:01.200]   To uh, this is the privacy focused vision for social networking. I'd log in but I don't have a facebook account
[00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:06.000]   Um, so I haven't read this yet, but maybe jeff you can summarize
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.320]   It's I think it's a very big deal. He's saying that
[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:12.960]   Uh over time and it's gonna take time
[00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:19.040]   He's gonna switch the company pretty much to encrypted messaging the whole thing and
[00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:24.160]   Yeah, yeah, I don't know how much of the old facebook will remain or how this will take time
[00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:27.200]   But he believes that that uh, you know, he's he's listened
[00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:32.800]   and seen the pressure and seen the error of their ways though he doesn't go into great confession
[00:25:32.800 --> 00:25:38.720]   And says that the way people are gonna want to communicate going forward is is in control and they're gonna want
[00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:42.000]   encryption and they're gonna want a lack of permanence
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.160]   and um
[00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:49.760]   They're gonna want interoperability across the services and they're gonna want to be able to communicate with people without necessarily knowing the phone number
[00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:55.920]   Why I I will confess, you know when I heard this I laughed and I think others have
[00:25:56.640 --> 00:26:03.120]   Um, but the proof isn't the pudding. I mean if he really does this I think I think facebook would be uh, I would I would go back
[00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:10.000]   Right. So here he says the privacy this privacy focused platform. So this is really a redesign, right? This is a
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:13.520]   It's a real pivot. I mean, this is a honest to god pivot
[00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:15.280]   We planned i know this
[00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:20.480]   So the way we've developed what's app focus on the most fundamental and private use case messaging
[00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:23.760]   Talk about a pivot say facebook is now a
[00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:30.240]   A messaging platform make it as secure as possible then build more ways for people to interact on top of that including calls
[00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:32.720]   video chats groups
[00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:34.720]   stories business payments
[00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:36.800]   Commerce and ultimately a platform for other
[00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:41.040]   Private services, you know what the model for this is probably line
[00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:44.080]   And we chat
[00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:47.440]   Line is used in japan we chat in china and they've become
[00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:51.040]   dominant platforms. I mean very successful
[00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:53.760]   this will be
[00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:55.840]   That's probably smart, right?
[00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:58.720]   Yeah, it is. I mean there's gonna be I think cops will hate it
[00:26:58.720 --> 00:27:04.640]   And there will be you know dark things that happen on these platforms as they do now on what's app
[00:27:04.640 --> 00:27:07.200]   But they'll happen in a smaller scale
[00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:15.280]   So here are the principles of this platform as you mentioned private interactions people could have simple intimate places where they have clear control
[00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:21.120]   Over who can communicate with them and confidence that no one else can access what they share
[00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:25.520]   I this begs the question. How are they going to do advertising?
[00:27:25.520 --> 00:27:31.520]   There's no mention of the business model to this at all my guess that's
[00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:39.040]   Is that he makes reference to being able to have connections with that with a merchant with a company
[00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:46.480]   So I I wonder whether enabling connections becomes a new form of advertising which would be really revolutionary in and of itself
[00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:51.040]   But that is me guessing by the way full disclosure. I raised money for my school from facebook
[00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:54.640]   I'm independent of facebook and we say the money personally from facebook and our disclosure keep going
[00:27:54.640 --> 00:28:00.080]   So that is kind of interesting because it would be a firm an advertiser's point of view
[00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:08.960]   If it was if all the interactions on facebook were opt in on the users part of so the advertiser comes to facebook
[00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:16.480]   You know, let's say it's pampers diapers and says look we want to have a relationship with parents who have
[00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:18.960]   infants
[00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:20.960]   On facebook and facebook says okay
[00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:24.560]   Well, we're going to ask them if they want to have a relationship with you
[00:28:24.560 --> 00:28:29.360]   And the parents who opt in and of course pampers would probably say well you get coupons
[00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:33.520]   You know, there's gonna be some sort of incentive right the parents who opt in are actually the parent
[00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:38.240]   The people pampers most wants to talk to right people who are buying diapers
[00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:40.560]   and who
[00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:43.440]   Want what pampers has to offer so if that is
[00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:46.320]   We are just speculating this we don't know how they're going to do this
[00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:51.600]   No idea, but this is how we can think it could work in a way that's like our model. That's what our model is
[00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:57.200]   So wait you guys before we get all speculative. I really think that
[00:28:57.200 --> 00:29:03.600]   By not including the business model in this that he missed a real opportunity
[00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:05.680]   and
[00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:12.240]   It's one thing to promise these things and to say these things but to not have this is this is silicon valley is kind of
[00:29:12.240 --> 00:29:15.040]   What is it their weak link is
[00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:21.520]   They equate users with success. Yeah, build build build an audience first and then monetize later
[00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:24.800]   And that's how Facebook started frankly. I mean Facebook didn't monetize
[00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:31.680]   I don't think the problem is here. Yeah, I see your point, but here's the problem. I don't think
[00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:34.160]   Any
[00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:35.920]   present day merchant
[00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:38.160]   Save perhaps amazon would understand this
[00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:40.160]   And so
[00:29:40.160 --> 00:29:45.120]   He has to announce it first figure it out first probably doesn't know what the business model is
[00:29:45.680 --> 00:29:48.320]   And the advertisers the merchants call them
[00:29:48.320 --> 00:29:52.240]   Will follow along much later. I would guess he has thoughts
[00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:54.720]   Gambold will say what
[00:29:54.720 --> 00:29:58.320]   He probably has some thoughts and I don't blame him for not saying anything yet
[00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:03.440]   Because it's not clear and he can have I mean honestly they can afford to build this
[00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:08.160]   And not make any money on it for a few years. They've got how much money do they have
[00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:14.320]   So they're publicly traded company though, so they know that's true. They have a fiduciary responsibility
[00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:20.320]   They are the some countries will not want this service and they're fine with not being in those countries love it
[00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:22.960]   That's the right answer, right?
[00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:25.200]   So keep going down. Yes, if australia says
[00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:32.160]   You can't encrypt you can't have it maybe maybe so number two right after private interactions is encryption
[00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:35.680]   End-to-end encryption prevents anyone including us
[00:30:35.680 --> 00:30:39.360]   From seeing what you shared. That's that's how it should be that signal
[00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:44.880]   That by the way is not I don't I guess facebook messenger does use signal, right?
[00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:49.040]   So they use the the open whisper platform. So I guess that's the case with
[00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:52.640]   Facebook messenger not with what's app. I don't believe
[00:30:52.640 --> 00:30:54.480]   So
[00:30:54.480 --> 00:31:02.400]   They're they're talking in their encryption section about working with law enforcement and how to prevent people from doing quote terrible things
[00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:07.360]   Like child exploitation terrorism and extortion on these encrypted channels
[00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:12.240]   So they're talking about how are they going to identify people who are abusing that
[00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:15.200]   And they're trading
[00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:17.280]   algorithms
[00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:23.600]   He does say we had a case where one of our employees was jailed for not providing access to someone's private information
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:26.400]   Even though we couldn't access it because it was encrypted
[00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:30.080]   Wow, I didn't did we know that I don't remember that
[00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:35.440]   So he says I'm balanced I believe working towards implementing end-to-end encryption
[00:31:36.240 --> 00:31:38.560]   For all private communications is the right thing to do
[00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:43.040]   Messages and calls are some of the most sensitive private conversations people have
[00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:50.720]   But we have to take the time to build the appropriate safety systems that stop bad actors as much as we can
[00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:54.080]   Within the limits of the an encrypted service that begs the question
[00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:58.640]   How much could they if they don't if they can't see into it, they can't stop it at all
[00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:04.720]   Right. So that's what that's what I was saying is that's they're going to use algorithms to detect those patterns
[00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:07.040]   What happened later talks about
[00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:09.520]   Connections about
[00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:11.520]   Metadata and connections between people
[00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:17.840]   And he says on balance he believes that working towards implementing end-to-end encryption is the right thing to do
[00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:22.000]   But they said we're gonna yeah, we're gonna discuss with the extra
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:25.440]   Before fully implementing end-to-end
[00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:29.120]   All right edges in here. So that's the big hedge on that is encryption
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:37.360]   Reducing permanence you mentioned that of course, that's what snapchat does people should be comfortable being themselves should not have to worry about what they sure coming back to hurt them later
[00:32:37.360 --> 00:32:41.200]   That's I think one of the big things that keeps under 25s off facebook
[00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:45.440]   That the fact that their parents and grandparents are there, but they also want impermanence
[00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:47.920]   They don't want to create a record of their behavior
[00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:53.440]   And it makes a point that you can you can opt out of the opt out
[00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:55.920]   You know, you can choose to save things
[00:32:56.320 --> 00:33:00.240]   The stories now go away and you can archive them you could archive things you could turn off
[00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:01.920]   the
[00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:03.200]   You know the
[00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:06.160]   Bishan impossible tape and it won't self-destruct
[00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:13.920]   You know if he if this is sincere and I believe I feel like it is
[00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:15.760]   and
[00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:17.760]   They do implement this this
[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:20.240]   only facebook could do this
[00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:23.360]   And this could be huge. What is the
[00:33:24.560 --> 00:33:30.560]   Monetization aside and there clearly issues there. There's also issues with encryption, but let's put those aside for a second
[00:33:30.560 --> 00:33:33.280]   Would this make facebook less?
[00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:35.920]   interesting for its current
[00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:37.520]   users
[00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:39.520]   or more interesting I think
[00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:42.880]   I think it probably broadens the user base and the people who are
[00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:45.520]   Uncomfortable today would be
[00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:52.400]   more comfortable coming back to the platform or spending time on the platform. I hope he's sincere in this. I mean
[00:33:53.360 --> 00:33:56.160]   it doesn't address the big issue of
[00:33:56.160 --> 00:34:01.520]   People spending time on facebook and feeling bad about themselves. So there's the issues of like
[00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:08.000]   Sharing fake news sharing bad stories. Not understanding. Yeah, but you don't hear do you hear that about messaging apps?
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:15.920]   You hear that about what's app and it has been a major factor in disinformation campaigns in Brazil and India
[00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:18.800]   India it's been used to create mob violence
[00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:26.160]   Right, so there are huge issues there. Yeah, but that's because it's a one-to-many
[00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:30.720]   Platform and it doesn't sound like one to few. It's a one to not many
[00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:33.760]   But this sounds like more one-to-one
[00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:37.360]   Uh, yeah, it's so they will have your
[00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:43.920]   You know, you absolutely have to but but but they reduced how many hops you can make with it
[00:34:43.920 --> 00:34:48.000]   uh recently to try to get to that and and
[00:34:48.800 --> 00:34:55.200]   So yeah, I think I think it has the opportunity to to pull down and it as some are arguing it adds friction into the sharing
[00:34:55.200 --> 00:35:00.080]   How news works with this? I have no fen idea. Well, but
[00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:02.960]   They're making it apart from this
[00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:07.280]   Go ahead stacey. Yeah, they're gonna make it much more
[00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:12.160]   Uh, he calls it interoperability, but it's basically
[00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:18.720]   You know messenger Instagram, what's app all of those things you're gonna be able to message cross platform to people
[00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:21.200]   I don't know how I feel about that
[00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:24.080]   Uh, it's gonna be at your option
[00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:28.880]   Uh, but isn't that what you want you want a phone that can call anybody, right? Is that what you want?
[00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:30.720]   Well, but i'm
[00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:32.800]   Anybody who's on a facebook platform, right?
[00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:40.080]   And I don't want my data shared across different platforms. My audience on facebook versus my audience on instagram might be different
[00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:46.000]   My website. I don't think it's an audience anymore. Yeah, it's my contact
[00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:49.280]   and second
[00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:52.240]   Part of the point of this is that is someone who you don't want
[00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:55.840]   Let's say it's a merchant. You don't want them to know your phone number
[00:35:55.840 --> 00:36:02.000]   You can have them contact you using the same technology through facebook not through uh, sms
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:05.760]   So you have more privacy that's nice
[00:36:05.760 --> 00:36:09.680]   But so what marks well
[00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:14.080]   Thinking anymore stacey. What is it anymore? It becomes something I did really new
[00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:17.200]   right
[00:36:17.360 --> 00:36:19.360]   I just don't trust them
[00:36:19.360 --> 00:36:22.320]   Yeah, that well, that's what this all comes down to is how sincere is this?
[00:36:22.320 --> 00:36:27.360]   I think the opportunity he could be very sincere. I think it's sincere the I think the opportunity
[00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:31.600]   He's got a crisis to deal with and he's trying to create a deal with it boy. You know
[00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:33.760]   We'll see
[00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:37.040]   I've been extremely critical of facebook and left facebook
[00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:38.880]   but
[00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:41.120]   if what he's describing here for instance
[00:36:41.760 --> 00:36:47.440]   If this is created facebook would have tools and and oh this is going to be the crux of the matter
[00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:51.040]   If they have the willingness to use them to keep you from getting spam
[00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:57.040]   To keep you you know to give you control. This is something the phone companies have been unwilling to do right with robo calls and spam
[00:36:57.040 --> 00:37:02.080]   Text but if facebook is sincere about this and in order to make this a good platform
[00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:06.640]   They'd have to and I know mark is thinking as a technologist. We could figure that part out
[00:37:06.640 --> 00:37:09.840]   The real challenge the real challenges for them
[00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:13.440]   Not to get sucked in this is what happens, but this is what happened with google
[00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:18.640]   It's what happened with facebook is you start with great intentions and then you get sucked into
[00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:24.560]   The monetization strategy and you start to give more and more and more to the people who are giving you money
[00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:26.720]   And and so
[00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:32.320]   Your customers become your product becomes the the users your customers become the advertisers
[00:37:32.320 --> 00:37:34.560]   This is a this is a shift to say
[00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:39.440]   Our customers are our users and if they do that properly that's
[00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:46.080]   Exactly what they should do this potentially this potentially is the end of the mass
[00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:53.840]   It potentially and only again worse respectfully. We don't know but but you just you can't imagine how you can amass
[00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:56.320]   A million people at once for a message
[00:37:56.320 --> 00:38:03.280]   Um and and so if that's what they do then people then those who want to mess
[00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:09.360]   Said messages to us have to establish a different kind of relationship and every value that would be way higher value
[00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:12.720]   Because if you make that connection with somebody that's way high value
[00:38:12.720 --> 00:38:18.480]   But but if we if this is the first move and again, we don't know we are speculating
[00:38:18.480 --> 00:38:19.840]   We are hoping here
[00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:25.680]   But if it moves away from volume for volume sake attention for attention sakes clicks for clicks sake
[00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:29.680]   And all of that that is the ill of not only the internet, but also mass media
[00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:32.320]   It's the reason we have CNN the way it is. Yeah
[00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:38.240]   Uh, then that could be a really revolutionary thing, but we don't know
[00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:41.440]   And proof of the pudding. Yeah, because you're right
[00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:48.240]   It's how he excutes. Yeah, excuse it and as a weather any merchants are gonna find value in this he hasn't exactly earned our trust
[00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:53.680]   Well, and he's still not earning it because he doesn't talk about monetization here
[00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:58.000]   And I agree or I think it's a really interesting point that you brought up about the end of the mass
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:05.440]   And we may even not see it when we talk about firms like we chat their monetization strategies are very different
[00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:08.720]   They're actually doing much more of an extra centric. Yes
[00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:11.120]   model so
[00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:14.800]   We could be looking at something like that. You saw that I think it was last week
[00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:22.560]   Uh, they talked about facebook doing a digital coin right for whatsapp so if you look at that then
[00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:25.120]   maybe this is
[00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:28.240]   Yes, they had to do something this is a crisis, but
[00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:30.880]   The cynical side of me is like well
[00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:34.720]   Maybe it's just timed. Maybe we're maturing past
[00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:37.520]   crappy advertising
[00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:43.680]   You know like we we went past crappy banner ads and now we're going to go past crappy invasive ads
[00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:47.280]   And we're going to move to a different model and this may be that
[00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:52.400]   This is saying honestly, I mean again, I can't spout for his sincerity
[00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:56.640]   But what he's in my opinion saying is we want to be a platform line is a platform
[00:39:56.640 --> 00:40:01.600]   We chat is a platform and just as microsoft windows was a platform
[00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:06.720]   You the one of the key elements to platform is
[00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:10.800]   Your platform the people who build on your platform make more money than you do
[00:40:10.800 --> 00:40:15.600]   But you make money in aggregate because they all give you the pennies as they make the dollars
[00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:23.200]   And it's not and now and look at microsoft did they pivoted from windows to the cloud as their platform to azure
[00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:27.360]   And I I think we all understand platform is extremely powerful
[00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:30.000]   It's it is make this makes a lot of sense
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:35.760]   If you're if facebook given the problems facebook has which are at this point almost insurmountable
[00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:41.840]   Um, and people are probably leaving in droves and more importantly nobody under 25 is using them
[00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:46.160]   Here's an opportunity to say well, we don't need that will be a platform
[00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:49.600]   We'll be like line and we chat if you want to put air book airplane tickets
[00:40:49.600 --> 00:40:54.080]   You'll do it on facebook if you want to pay for your cab if you want to hear if you want to get pizza
[00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:58.320]   If you want to do anything because it's a transactional and secure transactional platform
[00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:02.960]   And given this the size of their existing user base and even more importantly
[00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:07.920]   That that user base is in countries developing nations where there isn't a platform yet
[00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:11.040]   Uh, the opportunity I think the opportunity is huge
[00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:17.520]   And frankly, we have wait to see what the stock market thinks we've we've lost out because we don't have a line or a we chat
[00:41:17.520 --> 00:41:19.760]   In the United States
[00:41:19.760 --> 00:41:26.800]   And facebook is we don't have government control that makes it possible. So your point leo earlier is right facebook's scale
[00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:32.160]   That it built the old fast way. Yeah is what enables them to potentially build a wechat
[00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:37.920]   And by the way, and this is that this is the bigger warning than the monetization warning
[00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:40.720]   They become a quasi governmental
[00:41:40.720 --> 00:41:42.800]   operation
[00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:49.040]   Because as soon as you're paying your water bill through them and you're buying airplane tickets through them and yours transferring money
[00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:53.680]   They become more than a bank. They become a quasi governmental organization
[00:41:53.680 --> 00:42:01.120]   They become the center of your universe and I think mark also recognizes that and that's that that's a huge opportunity
[00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:04.320]   Isn't really that what amazon is trying to do
[00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:08.240]   And the amazon's trying to do that's what we just did and yes
[00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:12.480]   So I can see why mark would say well, don't worry about monetization. There's
[00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:19.120]   If we build this platform if we build it, they will come let's here's Alex stamos's reaction. He's the former
[00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:23.760]   uh chief information security officer who left facebook disgruntled
[00:42:23.760 --> 00:42:27.120]   Uh, he's a very smart guy highly respected
[00:42:27.920 --> 00:42:32.480]   He said this is not a post I expected to read and I wish he'd written it two years ago
[00:42:32.480 --> 00:42:35.360]   That's interesting in that
[00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:37.440]   Two years ago is when mark when Alex left
[00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:42.240]   Hopefully the external vision is reflected in internal moves to change product culture
[00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:48.240]   That's key right that informs thousands of product and engineering decisions per year turning a ship that large is difficult
[00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:53.360]   And I would agree with that and maybe mark zuggerberg is the only founder who still has enough control
[00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:57.440]   And enough influence over a massive organization that he could actually do it
[00:42:58.160 --> 00:43:01.440]   And certainly i'm more than cool can yeah much more than eric and larry
[00:43:01.440 --> 00:43:04.560]   um
[00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:07.120]   He talks about the two factors seredy and larry seredy
[00:43:07.120 --> 00:43:11.840]   Larry what I say eric's afghan eric's a larry. Yes seredy and larry
[00:43:11.840 --> 00:43:18.400]   He says I totally agree encryption is decentralizing it reduces the chance for centralized access to masses of data
[00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:24.320]   But making end-to-end encryption and expected requirement for social networks is a massive competitive moat
[00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:27.600]   Of course it is. Why do you think mark wants to do it?
[00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:29.360]   uh
[00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:34.240]   Of course he you know he talks about interoperability and god bless him. I hope he does it
[00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:39.520]   But the ultimate goal of this is just as amazon's ultimate goal is to get every transaction going through amazon's
[00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:43.280]   Mark's goal would be to have every transaction go through facebook
[00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:46.240]   And I think he's uniquely positioned to do that frankly
[00:43:46.240 --> 00:43:53.680]   Wow stamos says it's refreshing to see mark explicitly talk about the downsides of connecting people
[00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:59.040]   A problem right facebook's never really acknowledged that and even using the magic words like terrorism
[00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:02.640]   And child exploitation and extortion
[00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:08.400]   Uh, that's all he's using those as a reason to not allow end-to-end encryption right
[00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:15.600]   Hold off on that which but he's right those are hard issues. Yeah, those are those are really difficult and
[00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:19.840]   Individualized and they don't scale it would be a mistake to be
[00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:25.440]   To insist on purity at this point anyway, he might in the long run. I don't know
[00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:29.040]   Uh, it's really gonna also depend on what his customers want
[00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:35.680]   Ultimately they want pure and what the problem here is your laws are gonna come in like crazy right
[00:44:35.680 --> 00:44:39.760]   Well, I love it that he says if you don't like it will go somewhere else
[00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:43.600]   Yeah, again you couldn't do a startup this way
[00:44:43.600 --> 00:44:47.600]   But but given it's a huge pivot you're right jeff
[00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:56.800]   But given the size of facebook's audience and I would bet at least a number a good percentage of it would love something like this
[00:44:56.800 --> 00:45:02.160]   So can we talk about this in light of the fact that they have been using our phone number
[00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:04.400]   advertising
[00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:06.400]   Raises that he says
[00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:11.040]   To that end this week's two-factor number authentication screw-up
[00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:15.760]   Has become more important for facebook to address while the number of effect is small
[00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:18.640]   This is a clear privacy security win
[00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:23.600]   And not fixing it is incompatible with his sentiment that he wants to bend the curve on perception
[00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:26.080]   So the issue we should tell people is
[00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:33.760]   Well, and there you go jeremy barge of uh of emojipedia tweeted it for years facebook claimed adding a phone number to facebook
[00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:36.240]   Was for two-factor for security
[00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:42.160]   But it can be searched and there's no way to disable that you can limit it to friends
[00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:45.600]   But it can still be searched which means it is just too effective at all
[00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:53.040]   No, in fact, remember we reported on this months ago that you could also buy ads by some of these two-factor phone number
[00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:56.080]   So facebook has been using it to monetize as well
[00:45:56.080 --> 00:45:59.360]   And that's this is why they have a lot
[00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:02.160]   They got a big hold of you know, they've dug themselves
[00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:10.320]   And I would have fixed that I'd respond to that before marce post today because it just it's Stacy put two or two together there immediately yes
[00:46:11.520 --> 00:46:18.560]   Well, and I don't know if they're just assuming that people not enough of their users actually care about two-factor which is probably
[00:46:18.560 --> 00:46:22.000]   A reasonable thing to think
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:29.760]   But I think two-factor is becoming more and more relevant to more and more people today and thus
[00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:32.800]   They can't
[00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:35.520]   This is this is why I don't trust facebook
[00:46:35.520 --> 00:46:41.120]   When everybody when the whole sky is coming down on them they will they will address it
[00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:46.400]   But when it's just a few people who are admittedly very smart, they're just like eh screw it
[00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:50.400]   They're kind of like the republican party in some ways stamos causes big
[00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:54.800]   They're sorry shots fired, right?
[00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:58.080]   I'm gonna move on now stacy
[00:46:58.080 --> 00:47:01.760]   We'll pretend we didn't hear that
[00:47:01.760 --> 00:47:06.000]   Stamos calls us a judo move actually it's very interesting
[00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:11.680]   He said right now facebook gets crap from the same people for both invading people's privacy and
[00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:14.400]   not policing communications enough
[00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:18.080]   This what marx just announced is a judo move
[00:47:18.080 --> 00:47:25.440]   In a world where everything is encrypted and doesn't last long entire classes of scandal are invisible to the media
[00:47:25.440 --> 00:47:30.320]   That is true
[00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:36.320]   Yep, yep, and it's it's much better to be like everything's encrypted and private so we don't know what you're doing
[00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:38.800]   We don't share our data with researchers
[00:47:38.800 --> 00:47:42.720]   Oh, we can't share our data with researchers. This is
[00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:47.120]   Let me express my concern about this as as as mr. Public
[00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:51.920]   I would lament
[00:47:51.920 --> 00:47:54.720]   if
[00:47:54.720 --> 00:47:56.560]   We lose the ability to do a couple things
[00:47:56.560 --> 00:47:59.920]   one is to
[00:47:59.920 --> 00:48:01.680]   Say something to the world
[00:48:01.680 --> 00:48:05.760]   Two is to find people like me who I don't know and organize
[00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:08.880]   Three is to share news and information
[00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:12.800]   These are things that facebook is still used for and used effectively
[00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:19.120]   So that's what twitter's for twitter answers weaknesses. Well, but I I think facebook has some some real differences there
[00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:23.360]   And I would hate to see twitter become then and then everybody's a go to twitter
[00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:26.080]   I'm talking about euro monopoly on news now. They're gonna give them crap
[00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:30.240]   Here's the problem with twitter that facebook immediately fixes which is I can't control
[00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:33.120]   Who's sending me messages and is in my feed?
[00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:40.080]   You know anybody anybody can spam me on twitter. Well, this is the video. You know who did that google plus. Yeah
[00:48:40.080 --> 00:48:43.600]   Google could have had this they could have had this
[00:48:43.600 --> 00:48:50.320]   Yeah, google this was very close to what google plus should have been I I honestly think mark said oh we're screwed
[00:48:51.520 --> 00:48:57.760]   We're gonna if we continue down the path we're going we're gonna spend the I'm gonna spend the rest of my life in litigation
[00:48:57.760 --> 00:49:01.840]   in fighting laws in going to congress testifying in part of
[00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:05.040]   Parliament I this is not a life. I want to live
[00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:12.080]   What can we do this is actually in my opinion exactly the right thing to do I could
[00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:15.920]   I imagine a facebook where all the communications
[00:49:15.920 --> 00:49:19.200]   It's really a messaging platform with all the communications that I
[00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:22.960]   Have are with people I choose to communicate with and
[00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:26.720]   Not I don't hear from anybody. I don't want to communicate with
[00:49:26.720 --> 00:49:32.720]   Uh, it's all encrypted this by the way. Let's them off the hook in fact stamos says
[00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:34.560]   uh
[00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:40.160]   Zuck is clearly given up on entering china because these changes make that impossible good
[00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:42.980]   He also says that a secure data
[00:49:42.980 --> 00:49:47.200]   So we will storage section is a massive shot across apples bow
[00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:53.440]   Because he says we will not build data centers in countries that have a track record of viling human rights
[00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:56.400]   What we're not going to be in china
[00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:59.200]   Um, that's brilliant
[00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:04.160]   You know, I am a vision leo that there was a whiteboard in in his fishbowl
[00:50:04.160 --> 00:50:08.720]   And they wrote down every problem they have and and stand back and say
[00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:11.760]   What could solve this?
[00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:17.760]   And it meant changing the essence of what facebook is right? They had to give up that notion of sharing and connecting
[00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:22.480]   Or connected to various much smaller scale. They had to give up their business model. I think facing
[00:50:22.480 --> 00:50:25.120]   I think I stole the answer to you in part is they don't know
[00:50:25.120 --> 00:50:32.000]   Um, but they have that's that's very silicon valley is saying well, let's build it and see if we're right and then we'll figure that out
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:33.680]   Um
[00:50:33.680 --> 00:50:37.280]   But but it's it's a judo move. Yeah, Alex is way right
[00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:40.960]   It's fascinating. He also brings up a wheat chat
[00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:45.360]   He says, uh, this is the wheat chat play moving away from ads
[00:50:46.160 --> 00:50:48.160]   to inter mediating commerce
[00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:52.000]   How you replace all that ad money is a big question for shareholders
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:56.160]   Yeah, but I think there's an opportunity here wheat chat's doing okay
[00:50:56.160 --> 00:51:03.440]   This is there. This is you know, this is about their this article in the new york times about their cryptocurrencies
[00:51:03.440 --> 00:51:09.280]   Uh, I don't know if they do cryptocurrencies. I don't know if they need to maybe they do a token system. Maybe
[00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:12.240]   That's there's money there too, right?
[00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:16.320]   Um, so he says the winners in this announcement are encryption advocates
[00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:19.680]   users in oppressive countries users who don't like
[00:51:19.680 --> 00:51:23.120]   le getting their chats that's law enforcement
[00:51:23.120 --> 00:51:26.000]   eu data protection authorities
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:31.040]   And wheat chat because wheat check has china all to itself. It's a greenfield now
[00:51:31.040 --> 00:51:38.240]   Losers right groups who want more content moderation. Yeah, facebook has dodged a bullet because they don't have to moderate
[00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:40.160]   They don't need to tell you more about that in a minute
[00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:45.040]   I was where I spent last week was either with just that with regulators and legislators and other people
[00:51:45.040 --> 00:51:51.680]   Uh other losers eulon enforcement us law enforcement and the intelligence community
[00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:55.520]   Smaller competitors who can't afford end-to-end encryption
[00:51:55.520 --> 00:52:00.560]   And wheat chat also loses because it's limited to china. You'll be boxed out
[00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:03.360]   Brilliant analysis
[00:52:03.360 --> 00:52:07.760]   I think it's a brilliant move and you know what this kind of reaffirms in my mind
[00:52:08.320 --> 00:52:13.440]   Zuckerberg's position as a deep thinker. I hadn't been getting that impression in the last few years
[00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:15.920]   I've just gotten impression of him as a sweaty apologizer
[00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:23.760]   I'm about to tweet that that leo port of late facebook hater. Yes is loving this announcement
[00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:25.920]   Well, if you know he has to live up
[00:52:25.920 --> 00:52:27.920]   Because you're not on twitter
[00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:28.800]   So
[00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:30.800]   Actually somehow I am on twitter. I have some
[00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:36.880]   You know, this is what's really hard about a lot about this throwing these things out is as soon as you go back
[00:52:36.960 --> 00:52:42.320]   Apparently this I had a cookie stored on this browser now man my old twitter account, which I thought I deleted
[00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:44.960]   So i'll delete it again
[00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:49.520]   Uh facebook I did deactivate as well. Just just go with it. They'll go. Oh
[00:52:49.520 --> 00:52:55.120]   It's north. I use twitter. I use a non personal account
[00:52:55.120 --> 00:53:00.560]   Uh, which I don't use to personally tweet as a news feed and it's a great news feed
[00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:06.480]   Especially in fact I wrote a blog post about it at leo loport.com if you use tweet deck tweet decks awesome because I could
[00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:11.040]   Talked about this before I could turn off retweets, which is where all the outrage and heat comes from
[00:53:11.040 --> 00:53:14.240]   Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. I just see original tweets
[00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:17.200]   And I only see it from journalist because that's who I follow
[00:53:17.200 --> 00:53:21.360]   It's that then it's that's stasis utopia
[00:53:21.360 --> 00:53:28.000]   But the thing is for me is never true. I don't I don't actually use it as a news feed so much as I use it as a news feed
[00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:36.240]   Well, it is um, but it's a it's a way to continually be exposed to ideas from some of the wonky people
[00:53:36.240 --> 00:53:40.640]   Yeah, you have conversations. Um, I I still have trouble with the
[00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:44.080]   with conversations on twitter, but
[00:53:44.080 --> 00:53:50.240]   Um, well, I hate people so twitter is good for that. I can lurk. Oh, I hate people as much as you do
[00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:53.280]   Maybe more
[00:53:53.280 --> 00:53:55.680]   fighting words
[00:53:55.680 --> 00:53:58.880]   I'm the grumpiest of us all and i'm the one who likes people
[00:53:58.880 --> 00:54:03.920]   That's true. Maybe we need to be grumpy or stasis
[00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:05.920]   people who need people
[00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:09.280]   Are the
[00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:11.280]   Honestly, uh most of the time
[00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:14.560]   Twitter is is still a lot of junk
[00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:19.200]   But I do as having it as a news feed gives me stories and that's useful
[00:54:19.200 --> 00:54:23.600]   The one thing I never do is look at at replies and that's why I don't get in conversations
[00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:29.040]   Because I can't control the at replies and and I don't want to see most of the stuff people are sweetening at me
[00:54:29.040 --> 00:54:31.200]   I'm surprised that you don't get that, but i'm glad you don't
[00:54:31.840 --> 00:54:36.800]   I think that you will your mind will be changed. I get some of it, but you get a lot of it
[00:54:36.800 --> 00:54:44.480]   Yeah, I you know, Leo you've been public for years you get people who you know stupid critics like I used to be on tv god
[00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:47.760]   Uh complaining about people like you who used to be on tv
[00:54:47.760 --> 00:54:54.880]   I when I was before twitter, I was a happy man. I didn't know what people really thought now. I know what people think
[00:54:56.640 --> 00:55:04.480]   I think maybe people just are nice to me. I've had like maybe just a few of i've looked at your conversations on twitter and it's it's
[00:55:04.480 --> 00:55:11.520]   I'm my mind boggles. It's like why what a nice conversation. No, what a wonderful
[00:55:11.520 --> 00:55:17.920]   I love my people nice comments people are saying interesting things. I understand why you like twitter
[00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:20.400]   It just has a sourd for you yet
[00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:24.880]   And and and god willing it never will
[00:55:24.880 --> 00:55:29.120]   Maybe maybe i'm just so nice that people
[00:55:29.120 --> 00:55:34.960]   I thought I was nice, but maybe i'm not maybe that's the problem. Maybe I just think i'm nice
[00:55:34.960 --> 00:55:39.520]   Ooh, can I tell you about where I was last week?
[00:55:39.520 --> 00:55:44.640]   I know I now want to know what Stacy's going whoa about and then I would
[00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:47.360]   Tweeted me something really interesting
[00:55:49.840 --> 00:55:54.240]   What yeah, yeah level hot pantry.com
[00:55:54.240 --> 00:56:01.120]   Level the ai magic behind the hot pantry. I don't even know what this is. This is so
[00:56:01.120 --> 00:56:04.720]   This is exactly why i'm not on twitter
[00:56:04.720 --> 00:56:11.520]   Oh gosh, you just got sucked into something that by the end of the hour and a half you spend on it
[00:56:11.520 --> 00:56:14.080]   You will say

[00:56:36.480 --> 00:56:43.200]   I think it's starting to start a petition among the staff to get one whatever it is. Oh, this is exactly what's wrong with
[00:56:43.200 --> 00:56:45.120]   Oh, and they restock it

[00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:28.240]   You obviously never worked in an office people cook all sorts of crap in that microwave and the smell
[00:57:28.240 --> 00:57:34.080]   All it takes is one person to cook the leftover fish from last night and this place will smell like fish for days
[00:57:34.080 --> 00:57:41.600]   As a wag said in my office once when someone did that why don't you just skip a step and scrap and then crap in the microwave? Yes
[00:57:43.680 --> 00:57:49.440]   Yes, I don't want the smell these guys provide the snacks. Maybe they don't provide fish based snacks
[00:57:49.440 --> 00:57:51.280]   Yeah
[00:57:51.280 --> 00:57:53.280]   Maybe they have a stand there in control
[00:57:53.280 --> 00:57:59.200]   Yeah, I know you're gonna smell this you're gonna smell sausage cooking you're gonna smell all sorts of crap

[00:58:05.120 --> 00:58:08.880]   See the problem in my office is right next to the microwave
[00:58:09.280 --> 00:58:12.880]   That this you've given up good food. So now he just doesn't want anybody to enjoy
[00:58:12.880 --> 00:58:15.600]   I don't want anybody to enjoy their food. Maybe the ultimate grump
[00:58:15.600 --> 00:58:19.840]   All right. I'm going to a lovely cocktail party at bourbon and brancin a little bit
[00:58:19.840 --> 00:58:22.480]   Last pass is having its party at the rsa
[00:58:22.480 --> 00:58:27.280]   Conference and in fact if you're at rsa go to the last pass booth get the password
[00:58:27.280 --> 00:58:29.200]   We'll see it bourbon and brancin a couple of hours
[00:58:29.200 --> 00:58:32.320]   And I am not going to be able to eat anything there
[00:58:32.320 --> 00:58:37.360]   How was the roadie? Oh, you don't want to eat the whole thing? No, there's leftover roadie
[00:58:38.640 --> 00:58:40.240]   He ate one
[00:58:40.240 --> 00:58:42.240]   That's like that's like three stars
[00:58:42.240 --> 00:58:50.320]   If it was really good that'd be gone, right? Yeah, all right. I know I know I'm no fool
[00:58:50.320 --> 00:58:56.400]   Our show today brought to you by your craky pants today. Okay. I really is. I'm not cranky
[00:58:56.400 --> 00:58:59.040]   I'm honest
[00:58:59.040 --> 00:59:02.400]   Some bread you'll feel a lot better. I am not a polyana
[00:59:03.440 --> 00:59:09.920]   I am not a polyana either. You were so much more credulous on facebook. Okay. Do your ad. I'm sorry craky
[00:59:09.920 --> 00:59:16.560]   You're right. I was the polyana on facebook. Wasn't I know no, I'm hopeful because I I feel like this is a this is a
[00:59:16.560 --> 00:59:19.760]   I you're right all evidence points to the
[00:59:19.760 --> 00:59:23.680]   Contrary that markle screw this up. It is not sincere blah blah blah
[00:59:23.680 --> 00:59:29.520]   But I do believe he's sincere. I believe he has the wherewithal to do this if he really does this
[00:59:30.960 --> 00:59:35.600]   This will this will save facebook for me and I think for itself
[00:59:35.600 --> 00:59:40.320]   And provide a much needed service my concern is at the other end
[00:59:40.320 --> 00:59:46.640]   Where it becomes a monopoly basically there's some issues with that or a monopsony
[00:59:46.640 --> 00:59:52.400]   There's some issues with that because we're gonna live in a world frankly where it's amazon google
[00:59:52.400 --> 00:59:58.640]   facebook and that's it and twit and me because
[00:59:59.520 --> 01:00:02.240]   Take of the podcast if I could make a pivot I would
[01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:09.920]   There's no there's no pivot left. I am pivot free. We're stuck. We're on this road and we're going
[01:00:09.920 --> 01:00:12.640]   You and I are too old to pivot
[01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:14.960]   Yes, we are

[01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:49.680]   We thank them so much for their support of small businesses like ours
[01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:56.720]   Everywhere well, I am glad you brought that up jeff because I had not really paid any attention because it came out this morning
[01:02:56.720 --> 01:02:59.760]   You're welcome and uh, I was busy. I didn't see it
[01:02:59.760 --> 01:03:02.240]   I'm very
[01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:03.280]   I'm really glad we had
[01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:09.520]   I'm glad it happened today because I wasn't sure what to think fully and I'm still not sure but but but your reaction fascinates me
[01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:10.720]   So it's good
[01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:15.840]   Um, I may be misunderstanding it but I but my sense of what he's trying to do is I can't well
[01:03:15.840 --> 01:03:18.640]   You know what let's wait. I'll bend Thompson ways in let's trajectory
[01:03:18.640 --> 01:03:23.920]   But I think he'll agree with me. This is a smart move. He's you know, yeah, you got your what are we chopped liver?
[01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:27.120]   No, yeah, apparently
[01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:32.080]   I know but I you know more positive than you guys
[01:03:32.080 --> 01:03:37.200]   That's over stacy does not stay. See does not
[01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:42.960]   Um, well, it does kind of bypass that whole are you helping publishers or not thing?
[01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:46.000]   That's over
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.800]   Well, but here's the thing
[01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:55.040]   if if if you look at brazil and india and say that uh once app has been an
[01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:59.120]   Incredibly important vehicle for news true and false
[01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:05.680]   The news organizations need to figure out how to promulgate news on messaging and they haven't done crap
[01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:08.960]   about that on the whole there been a few small experiments
[01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:13.440]   but um, they're gonna complain miserably, but they're old
[01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:16.480]   Just kills for once and for all the old
[01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:20.000]   drawn audience to your destination model
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:22.560]   Aspies dead people
[01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:30.960]   What about something like what linkedid does like the articles on linkedin and I say that because I actually do way better
[01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:35.600]   Posting something on linkedin to my very targeted number
[01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:43.280]   I mean, I do have quote unquote followers there, but I have also hash tagging things. I don't know this is also your topicality is appropriate for linkedin
[01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:47.120]   That's to me. This is the most important thing and it's what we learned here
[01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:54.800]   And in the podcast space is when it is an affinity group when you're talking to an affinity group people who opt into the conversation with you
[01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:58.240]   Those conversations are not only better. They're more valuable
[01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:04.720]   And I think that's exactly what he's saying is no, I think the whole idea of casting the wide net in the news feed that's all gone
[01:05:04.720 --> 01:05:11.200]   Com these is going to be a conversation network and you know, we've been saying this for a while. This is what we need
[01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:14.000]   Always should have done always should have been
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:20.560]   Well, I think this is a function also not just of the regulatory thing, but it's also a function of maturity when you're in college
[01:05:20.560 --> 01:05:25.520]   The idea of having all of your conversations on a public square is way more exciting
[01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:28.400]   Than when you're 40 and you realize you have
[01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:33.440]   All kinds of different layers and that's right who were in college is not the person
[01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:35.440]   That's exactly right. Yeah
[01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:39.040]   You will soon realize that reminding everybody of birthdays is cruel
[01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:44.960]   He's getting there. I love when people remember my birthday and I was still well when I made
[01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:49.120]   Oh, no, you won't know you won't you hear?
[01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:54.320]   I won't be here to to collect on that bet, but you won't I I do
[01:05:54.960 --> 01:06:00.800]   Even you miss unshinable not I do think this is also very free. Go ahead. I should be freaked out
[01:06:00.800 --> 01:06:06.160]   No, like about my birthday, but I'm not because I'm a woman. Yeah, I'm less valuable as I age
[01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:09.200]   Good for you
[01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:16.480]   You think we're more valuable now. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Well, no, you you passed the point of value
[01:06:16.480 --> 01:06:19.120]   Good
[01:06:22.640 --> 01:06:24.800]   You're just a former TV critic and a former
[01:06:24.800 --> 01:06:31.680]   Host I'm a I didn't put the I didn't put the thing up on your lower third. I'm a former
[01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:35.680]   Small-time host of a little watched cable channel
[01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:44.160]   So and I want if I ever get on msmbc again, which I won't I want that for my lower third
[01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:47.520]   former virtual reality barista
[01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:54.400]   Uh, all right. What else is there to talk about? What's the thing? All right, so let me tell you for just a second where I was last week
[01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:56.560]   Yeah, and where you are today. Oh, yeah, go ahead
[01:06:56.560 --> 01:07:01.680]   Well, I've been bossed, but that's another matter. Well, that's why you're in Boston too. Go ahead. No, I can't
[01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:04.160]   Last week. I was
[01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:12.160]   Something's happened, but I can't well, so but last week I was a ditch day
[01:07:13.600 --> 01:07:20.000]   um, which is an old estate in uh in the uk near oxford oxfordshire and there was a
[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:25.840]   transatlantic working group on content moderation and freedom of expression that I've joined
[01:07:25.840 --> 01:07:28.560]   organized by former fcc commissioner susanness
[01:07:28.560 --> 01:07:32.560]   And she brought in an amazing crew of people there
[01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:38.400]   Um to talk about regulation, right? So I thought I'm gonna be the only person in the room who's gonna who's gonna
[01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:44.080]   I'll be defending the internet. It was a fascinating discussion, but all I don't know what I'm gonna go to detail
[01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:46.560]   I better write up some ideas from this uh shortly
[01:07:46.560 --> 01:07:54.480]   But you see all the more why succubers move is so needed because the regulation on facebook especially
[01:07:54.480 --> 01:08:02.000]   Is coming from every possible quarter and last week before I went I wrote a post about 11 and 13 and then a
[01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:04.640]   Journalist report and then most of all
[01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:08.480]   There's the commons committee that succubers wouldn't testify before
[01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:16.240]   Released its report and it is to my mind frightening and just to give you one to two two little episodes from it
[01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:22.160]   One is that that they they want to go after not just the technology company
[01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:27.280]   But also the technologists in the company with heavy fines if they don't do what they want to do
[01:08:27.280 --> 01:08:29.920]   So this is a this is shot across the bow of
[01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:32.880]   a program or inside facebook
[01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:37.520]   The second thing that they say is that they want to incorporate increase
[01:08:38.320 --> 01:08:44.480]   Pii put personally the federal information not just what gdpr declares which is a whole bunch of ridiculous things like your ip address
[01:08:44.480 --> 01:08:47.280]   They also want it to be inferred data
[01:08:47.280 --> 01:08:53.360]   Which to me is a desk loan. No, it's a desk loan. No learning and against knowledge
[01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:56.720]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
[01:08:56.720 --> 01:09:01.040]   Let's debate this because I've been calling for a redefinition of pii
[01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:06.640]   To include more things including like what you can be inferred from your metadata
[01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:10.400]   as essential for privacy
[01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:13.600]   more devices. No, it doesn't
[01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:17.280]   It does not because the inference
[01:09:17.280 --> 01:09:20.880]   Okay
[01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:26.880]   You cannot include that with other like pii is a bundle of information. It's not one piece of information
[01:09:26.880 --> 01:09:29.360]   So if you pull in one piece of information
[01:09:29.360 --> 01:09:35.440]   That's relevant from a bunch of people. So it changes the way you have to assemble your data
[01:09:36.320 --> 01:09:38.640]   But you can still do machine learning
[01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:41.600]   Trust me keep going
[01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:44.400]   I love you anyway
[01:09:44.400 --> 01:09:51.200]   So so so anyway, so I just wanted to I'll write more about all the stuff in the future
[01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:55.120]   But it was interesting that in a truly multi stakeholder meeting
[01:09:55.120 --> 01:10:00.000]   Convened under chatter puss, which is why I'm not saying who was there and not quoting things directly
[01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:07.440]   It gave me so I'm not a right about regulatory regimes that I can get behind that do make sense to me
[01:10:07.440 --> 01:10:13.040]   And that's a big move for me just because everything I've seen thus far has been stupid
[01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:16.560]   But if I can start to get a conversation going about what would be smart
[01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:22.800]   I'm eager to have that conversation. So more to come later, but but but the
[01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:25.520]   Atmospheric remains
[01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:29.920]   Rapidly anti Facebook and so the timing of this is fascinating to me. That was all I wanted to say
[01:10:29.920 --> 01:10:34.960]   Stacey
[01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:37.440]   No, I just
[01:10:37.440 --> 01:10:41.680]   I'm excited by that, but I am really excited about this pii thing
[01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:46.560]   So jeff, I send me your post when you're ready. I want to talk all about it. Oh, okay
[01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:51.680]   The the post about the comments report is up on medium now what I did before going
[01:10:51.680 --> 01:10:54.560]   Europe against the net
[01:10:55.120 --> 01:10:57.760]   And so the my summary of of the of the
[01:10:57.760 --> 01:11:05.360]   Damien Collins report is the last third of that the first third is 11 and 13 which I all the more hate more than ever
[01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:07.440]   It's terrible
[01:11:07.440 --> 01:11:13.440]   This the middle is very wonky journalistic stuff about a report in the UK, but the bottom is about the comments report
[01:11:13.440 --> 01:11:20.000]   And you'll see my book. Okay. Yes. I skip over all of your all of the skip the journal. Lucky shop. You will care
[01:11:21.520 --> 01:11:25.840]   But the bottom stuff is about the college report. No, yeah, you do but most people
[01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:31.040]   Was like I am the car was that that's what my business card even says
[01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:35.680]   You're not talking about the audience. The people are formerly known as the audience as my friend jeff
[01:11:35.680 --> 01:11:43.840]   Yeah, I mean, I think this is one of the things that mark is looking down the road at and just says uh
[01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:49.440]   I'm getting I'm pivoting. I'm getting out of here. Yeah. Yeah. I don't blame him
[01:11:51.280 --> 01:11:58.160]   Um the torpedo came to the you boat and he just managed to move. Yeah, so there are a couple of questions, of course
[01:11:58.160 --> 01:12:06.000]   Whether the torpedo is gonna keep on coming anyway because yeah, I mean these things don't go away because you said i'm pivoting
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:10.560]   So he may still have some explaining to do
[01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:12.560]   It's gonna be
[01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:18.640]   End-degree harder for him to do this given the lack of trust and given the history because everybody's gonna do what stacy did
[01:12:18.720 --> 01:12:24.320]   They say well trust them. I don't know are they doing this right? So they've got they've got to change the culture too
[01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:26.800]   so
[01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:30.480]   markedly which Alex makes reference to there uh to prove
[01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:38.160]   Through transparency and through collaboration with experts outside the company what they're doing if they don't do that
[01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:40.000]   They'll blow it
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:43.520]   By the way, you asked about facebook's stock price. It basically closed up
[01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:48.400]   Today, although it's essentially level in uh in uh post
[01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:52.240]   Bells came out after stock close. I think yeah, this came after market close
[01:12:52.240 --> 01:12:56.480]   Okay. Well the after market after i was trading is pretty flat
[01:12:56.480 --> 01:13:02.000]   I because I think the market doesn't know what the f i think that's the they're waiting to see what jeff javus says
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:06.480]   Yeah, no leo report. Yes neither of us unfortunately
[01:13:06.480 --> 01:13:12.720]   Uh, yeah, I wonder what they're I wonder what they're waiting for I think it I think ultimately if I were a investor
[01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:14.480]   I'd say this is good news
[01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:17.120]   But there's going to be a bumpy it's going to be a bumpy transition
[01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:22.400]   I like your investor. I'd I'd again wonder about the monetization strategy
[01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:28.160]   Because I mean as an investor in wall street you're not usually long term your shorter term, right?
[01:13:28.160 --> 01:13:32.560]   That's the biggest yeah, this is gonna be a long term. It's like a real lunch though. Yeah, it's a ritz
[01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:35.520]   It's like a brand new facebook. You know the quick next question is uh
[01:13:35.520 --> 01:13:38.160]   Well twitter stock go up
[01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:40.800]   That's actually what I wondered. I was
[01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:48.800]   Because this twitter then becomes the way to talk to the mass public place. Yeah, no bass. There is no mass Stacy
[01:13:48.800 --> 01:13:52.240]   Okay, sorry. Sorry. No, you're right. It is good for twitter. You're right
[01:13:52.240 --> 01:13:58.960]   Yeah, yeah, it just makes twitter more of a dumpster fire. It would be good for instagram for no for a non-run
[01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:00.160]   um
[01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:01.280]   Snap
[01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:04.480]   This probably could this be the last nail the confidence nap
[01:14:04.480 --> 01:14:08.320]   It's been on the life support for some time, huh?
[01:14:10.080 --> 01:14:14.080]   Do you want to talk about we talked about it um on uh twit?
[01:14:14.080 --> 01:14:16.880]   But I thought it might be something you'd like to talk about
[01:14:16.880 --> 01:14:23.520]   Google refuses to remove an application a saudi arabian application
[01:14:23.520 --> 01:14:26.640]   uh
[01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:31.040]   But the story is more complicated than you might
[01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:34.640]   realize
[01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:36.400]   and um
[01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:43.760]   After I read more, please explain how it is because this really came be ajata. Yeah, so I'll give you the story which is uh
[01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:50.560]   Google has been asked to remove a saudi app called abscher
[01:14:50.560 --> 01:14:52.800]   which
[01:14:52.800 --> 01:14:54.800]   Let's men direct where women can travel
[01:14:54.800 --> 01:14:57.680]   And offers them alerts when
[01:14:57.680 --> 01:15:02.960]   They're women and in saudi arabian men are guardians of women including their wives
[01:15:03.760 --> 01:15:06.480]   uh when they use a passport to leave saudi arabia
[01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:07.840]   uh
[01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:12.160]   Members of congress including jackie spear yelon omar and rasheeda to leave
[01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:16.560]   Uh and 11 others demanded that apple and google kill the app
[01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:21.280]   Both promise to investigate apple hasn't said anything yet google says no
[01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:27.600]   We uh, it doesn't file any rules. We're going to keep it on if you just say that that sounds pretty bad
[01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:34.560]   But I'm very glad that I read hacker news because there was a much more nuanced conversation
[01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:39.120]   And it convinced me uh that google did the right thing
[01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:43.040]   Wow, you are just mr. Open-minded today grumpy
[01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:51.760]   So what was the nuance on hacker news? Uh, well read the read the comment thread so uh
[01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:55.040]   No, you're gonna do it for us. I will do it for you
[01:15:56.320 --> 01:16:01.120]   The app provides various governmental services among them a digitized version
[01:16:01.120 --> 01:16:07.440]   And this is important a digitized version of the yellow sheet that yellow sheet exists and has existed for years in saudi arabia
[01:16:07.440 --> 01:16:11.360]   A legal guardian has to fill it out for a woman to be able to leave the country
[01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:13.840]   Uh
[01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:16.960]   But getting rid of the app doesn't get rid of the yellow sheet
[01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:19.280]   Right
[01:16:19.280 --> 01:16:23.120]   The the process that's a governmental process that is going to continue
[01:16:23.120 --> 01:16:25.760]   and in fact
[01:16:25.760 --> 01:16:31.600]   Some activists in saudi arabia say the app actually makes it easier for women to move a
[01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:36.000]   Because part of the yellow sheet process the guardian has to go to the government office
[01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:41.040]   You can't just sign it. You can't write a note and say it's okay for leave the country you have to go in
[01:16:41.040 --> 01:16:43.920]   And that is a burden
[01:16:43.920 --> 01:16:49.120]   And this app eliminates that you don't have to get a signature on paper. You don't have to make a personal parents
[01:16:49.120 --> 01:16:51.920]   um, it's it's
[01:16:51.920 --> 01:16:53.920]   very straightforward
[01:16:54.080 --> 01:17:00.640]   So some activists in saudi arabia see value in that kind of app because it makes it easier to get out of the country without supervision
[01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:05.760]   And getting rid of the app wouldn't in any way change the system
[01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:11.680]   Now there were people on hacker news who say but this doesn't matter. It's an immoral action
[01:17:11.680 --> 01:17:17.200]   And so google shouldn't be making an app that allows this
[01:17:17.200 --> 01:17:23.280]   Um, and I understand that point of view, but I think in balance
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:27.600]   It's fascinating. Yeah, so you come back to you come down to balance thinking that they
[01:17:27.600 --> 01:17:31.280]   improved it by a country. Yeah, and I read a number of
[01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:34.640]   tweets from women in saudi arabia
[01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:38.800]   Who said of course it's bad
[01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:44.000]   That it exists or need to exist is a bad thing, but this is saudi law
[01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:50.480]   And to many of women in saudi arabia scrapping the app would hurt their agency not help it
[01:17:51.760 --> 01:17:56.880]   They need male approval to travel either way and by making it easier to get the app in practice in practice
[01:17:56.880 --> 01:18:01.200]   gives women more agency by lowering the bureaucratic barriers to travel
[01:18:01.200 --> 01:18:04.640]   It's like taking down massage parlor thing is off various online sites sent
[01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:07.280]   uh, sex workers back to the to the
[01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:12.800]   Arms of the pips right who abused them right and took away their agency
[01:18:12.800 --> 01:18:16.240]   We got
[01:18:16.240 --> 01:18:18.240]   here's the thing we've got a messed up world
[01:18:18.240 --> 01:18:21.120]   and um
[01:18:21.120 --> 01:18:22.560]   We've got to go
[01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:26.960]   Back to the core problems we have and it's not the technological angle to the story
[01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:34.160]   Soudy's got real problems here that need to get fixed. Yeah, that aren't me and really uh, it's a mistake
[01:18:34.160 --> 01:18:38.640]   I think to blame google or to to focus on the app when what you should be doing is
[01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:40.640]   Talking to this
[01:18:40.640 --> 01:18:47.120]   The bigger question is how our government that but he's up to regime. That's impigorous. Yeah, exactly right
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:54.560]   Because well and I mean in some ways you attack google because you can like right now I could change the world
[01:18:54.560 --> 01:18:57.520]   by tweeting um, but
[01:18:57.520 --> 01:19:00.480]   It feels like you're real can so I can see
[01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:03.920]   Well, yeah
[01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:10.400]   Anyways, so I think this is interesting and you know, uh, honestly nuance is
[01:19:10.400 --> 01:19:17.840]   A bad thing to introduce into a show of any kind because really hot takes and anger are much more effective
[01:19:18.480 --> 01:19:21.680]   but uh, no, this is good. We're trying to keep jeff from shouting
[01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:30.320]   Anyway, I don't know I I'll let you think about it if you if you decide to come back later with a thought
[01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:33.840]   It's more complicated than what might think
[01:19:33.840 --> 01:19:41.760]   Meanwhile google does apparently at least according to the intercept continue to work on dragonfly. It's chinese search
[01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:43.520]   but
[01:19:43.520 --> 01:19:45.200]   but google then responded
[01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:48.640]   What what I didn't oh here it is
[01:19:48.640 --> 01:19:56.320]   The speculation is inaccurate. So the intercept which I think sometimes does get things wrong in on this stuff. It's your buddy sam middle. Oh
[01:19:56.320 --> 01:19:59.360]   Forget it. I'm sorry even brought it up
[01:19:59.360 --> 01:20:04.400]   Okay, google says this speculation is inadequate inaccurate rather we have we said for many months
[01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:08.400]   We have no plans to watch search in china. There's no work being undertaken on such a product
[01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:14.640]   Project team members have moved to new projects a bill based it on commits to github in the recent months
[01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:17.200]   uh, what google said is
[01:20:17.200 --> 01:20:21.600]   We're gonna let these people finish the thing they were working on and then move them on but
[01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:26.160]   uh, you know that so that's probably why they were continuing to be commits
[01:20:26.160 --> 01:20:29.440]   Uh, I believe I'm gonna give google a pass
[01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:32.640]   There we go
[01:20:32.640 --> 01:20:36.160]   This is once again to give google a pass show you know what
[01:20:36.160 --> 01:20:42.000]   This is another reason why it's great that mark did what he did and I hope he continues to pursue this
[01:20:42.400 --> 01:20:46.320]   Because it puts the screws to companies like google if facebook says, okay
[01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:49.360]   We're not gonna be in china because there we can't
[01:20:49.360 --> 01:20:53.040]   Encrypt and we're not gonna store dairace data there
[01:20:53.040 --> 01:21:00.000]   It makes a lot harder for google say well, but we want to be in china makes a lot harder for apple cars to do it apples doing it
[01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:04.080]   And there's a lot of small so who cares? Well
[01:21:04.080 --> 01:21:08.720]   It's I think if if one big one of these big
[01:21:09.440 --> 01:21:13.360]   Fangs or as uh, I love ami webs term for them the gmafia
[01:21:13.360 --> 01:21:16.320]   Uh, which is google microsoft
[01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:18.240]   Uh apple
[01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:19.840]   No, I'm amazon
[01:21:19.840 --> 01:21:27.360]   I bm facebook and apple the gmafia if they if one of them says you know what we're gonna take a principal stand
[01:21:27.360 --> 01:21:30.880]   We're not gonna do it. It really makes it harder for the others to not
[01:21:30.880 --> 01:21:34.160]   To do it. Yep, I think
[01:21:34.160 --> 01:21:36.400]   Uh
[01:21:36.400 --> 01:21:39.600]   Do you want a vulvo pull star to sure you do
[01:21:39.600 --> 01:21:46.000]   Yeah, it's it's not it's got google. It's got android in it. It's a google palette
[01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:49.440]   In core
[01:21:49.440 --> 01:21:53.440]   Native and we're not talking android auto. I don't think we're talking like
[01:21:53.440 --> 01:21:56.240]   android
[01:21:56.240 --> 01:21:58.480]   Android native android for the car
[01:21:58.480 --> 01:22:03.520]   It's also going to be forty five forty thousand more than the yes, well, it's
[01:22:04.160 --> 01:22:07.760]   It's electric it looks pretty nice, right? Oh wait, it looks nice
[01:22:07.760 --> 01:22:13.040]   This says it's native android auto the verge is saying pull star two is doing
[01:22:13.040 --> 01:22:15.920]   Hold up
[01:22:15.920 --> 01:22:17.920]   native android auto
[01:22:17.920 --> 01:22:20.080]   Okay, well
[01:22:20.080 --> 01:22:26.240]   Yeah, yeah, that's what they're saying. I don't know i don't think it's android auto a native android infotainment system
[01:22:26.240 --> 01:22:32.080]   So understand the android auto requires a phone with android on it. This sounds like it's android in the car
[01:22:33.120 --> 01:22:38.000]   Which is what they've been trying to sell right? Oh, yeah, okay, right? It's still
[01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:43.040]   Yes, but it's still four cars. It's not the same android i got down on my phone
[01:22:43.040 --> 01:22:48.400]   Sorry, I was like that's what that's the deceit, but I got you I got what you're saying and I got what i'm saying
[01:22:48.400 --> 01:22:55.440]   I got it. So so waymo just announced today that they're going to be selling their sensors to other car makers
[01:22:55.440 --> 01:22:58.320]   Interesting that the google because the light are yeah
[01:22:58.880 --> 01:23:00.880]   B2b supplier
[01:23:00.880 --> 01:23:05.200]   manufacturer there was speculation that that was what apple was intending that apple decided
[01:23:05.200 --> 01:23:06.320]   Oh, we're not going to make cars
[01:23:06.320 --> 01:23:12.000]   That's but we'll make stuff the car makers need but elon has always said and I think tesla is somewhat proven
[01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:15.520]   That to make it really work. You need the data. You need to do it all
[01:23:15.520 --> 01:23:20.960]   You can't buy pieces from vendors. You have to make the whole thing because the data is
[01:23:20.960 --> 01:23:23.600]   what you're doing is is
[01:23:24.800 --> 01:23:28.240]   As a service I could see you buying the light are yeah, right?
[01:23:28.240 --> 01:23:31.840]   You know, well, you could also do self-driving as a service right
[01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:37.680]   Yeah, okay, and access to our data you still have all the data right the car would just not yeah be a
[01:23:37.680 --> 01:23:43.920]   Yo gm would make a car cause crashes, but we will go there today. So I don't want to go is it is that what it's going to happen
[01:23:43.920 --> 01:23:49.680]   Yeah, yeah, so jeff i have to i have to take us back. Can I take a slightly back?
[01:23:51.280 --> 01:23:57.040]   Are we are you clicking your ruby slippers to go to there's no place. So I am gonna
[01:23:57.040 --> 01:24:00.640]   There's a story actually I didn't see it on the rundown and I'm sad
[01:24:00.640 --> 01:24:08.640]   Google is making it easier for AI developers to keep users data private and it's actually talking about using differential privacy
[01:24:08.640 --> 01:24:11.600]   for machine learning on tensorflow
[01:24:11.600 --> 01:24:13.680]   So
[01:24:13.680 --> 01:24:16.560]   That's really that's exactly what we were just talking about
[01:24:17.120 --> 01:24:22.640]   jeff that allows us to pull data in for machine learning without making it
[01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:28.720]   So even things like pii without making it a problem and identifying people
[01:24:28.720 --> 01:24:31.520]   so I just thought that was like
[01:24:31.520 --> 01:24:35.760]   Really worth bringing up and I have many questions that are not answered in the story
[01:24:35.760 --> 01:24:40.560]   But I kind of really yes and differential privacy is what apple define that sorry
[01:24:40.560 --> 01:24:44.480]   No differential privacy is what apple is using
[01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:47.600]   Yes, no, I think I
[01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:50.240]   Is right. Yes. Yes
[01:24:50.240 --> 01:24:52.240]   I got all of a state of stacy is that I don't trust
[01:24:52.240 --> 01:24:59.760]   The government to define that because they do stupid things like saying every inference is now your property. That's done
[01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:03.520]   So stacy, what is differential privacy?
[01:25:03.520 --> 01:25:10.400]   That's basically where they take your data and they insert random noise into
[01:25:13.600 --> 01:25:18.160]   This is making little sad things insert random noise and data into it
[01:25:18.160 --> 01:25:24.880]   So it can't be it's not encrypted. So it's not saying it's decrypted is the wrong way to think about it
[01:25:24.880 --> 01:25:28.880]   The issue with with data of course is that it's not hard at all
[01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:33.520]   To use the data to de-anonymize it even if you've so-called anonymized it
[01:25:33.520 --> 01:25:38.960]   So this is a way of anonymizing data that can't be or theoretically can't be reversed
[01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:43.040]   So it can't be traced back to the creator of the data
[01:25:43.760 --> 01:25:44.560]   Right?
[01:25:44.560 --> 01:25:49.680]   Yes, yes, it can't be traced back to the person who's created it and
[01:25:49.680 --> 01:25:53.520]   In the way they do it is by adding
[01:25:53.520 --> 01:25:57.280]   random noise to the users patterns
[01:25:57.280 --> 01:25:59.280]   and so
[01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:07.200]   When people and so then they can that noise becomes filtered out though is they gather more and more data from a wide variety of people
[01:26:07.200 --> 01:26:12.400]   Right. So basically it's like those mosaics think about it like that Bob Marley poster in your college dorm
[01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:15.360]   There's native of other pictures of Bob Marley
[01:26:15.360 --> 01:26:19.440]   If all of those are slightly blurred blurred
[01:26:19.440 --> 01:26:25.040]   You know, you can't see that it's Bob Marley in the individual pictures, but all together
[01:26:25.040 --> 01:26:28.560]   You're like, oh, is that a roster like a singer? I gotta ask
[01:26:28.560 --> 01:26:31.200]   Did you have that poster?
[01:26:31.200 --> 01:26:33.680]   No, I did not
[01:26:33.680 --> 01:26:37.520]   Is that I would have to be think funny. Yeah, I had a Monet water
[01:26:39.120 --> 01:26:44.640]   I did not have the clumped though. I just don't like it. Oh, you don't have the clamped. Oh, come on the kiss
[01:26:44.640 --> 01:26:48.640]   I did have I didn't have the kiss, but I did have we have
[01:26:48.640 --> 01:26:50.480]   a
[01:26:50.480 --> 01:26:57.840]   Tapestry version of the kiss hanging in our entryway. How about that? There you go and next I'm gonna get a Bob Marley poster
[01:26:57.840 --> 01:27:00.800]   there
[01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:03.040]   I have the water lilies in my office though
[01:27:03.040 --> 01:27:04.960]   So
[01:27:04.960 --> 01:27:10.400]   Ulfar Ellingson who is a scientist at Google research scientist says differential privacy
[01:27:10.400 --> 01:27:15.760]   With mathematical certainty makes it impossible to trace the data back to its origin
[01:27:15.760 --> 01:27:24.960]   You have an outcome that is in mathematical certainty. It's proven to work. You have an outcome that's independent of any one person's data, but it's still a good outcome
[01:27:24.960 --> 01:27:27.840]   However
[01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:33.440]   By masking outliers it could sometimes remove relevant or interesting data, especially in very data sets
[01:27:34.240 --> 01:27:37.280]   So there's the problem homogenizer the problem somewhat
[01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:40.560]   So David Weinberger, you know David Weinberger
[01:27:40.560 --> 01:27:45.200]   Of the Clutrient Manifesto he has a new book coming out and I got the galleys coming out and bay
[01:27:45.200 --> 01:27:48.160]   I'll talk about more when it comes out, but it's brilliant
[01:27:48.160 --> 01:27:53.920]   And and as is David always and it's called everyday chaos pre-order it now
[01:27:53.920 --> 01:27:58.160]   Um, well, I'm well having one cars to make a note because I'd love to get him on triangulation
[01:27:58.960 --> 01:28:04.800]   But he talks about how what's really happening here is that in a world of machine learning and ab testing stuff
[01:28:04.800 --> 01:28:12.480]   The correlations that come along have no explanation fit no law right make no sense the data just tells you this is how this
[01:28:12.480 --> 01:28:18.880]   Disorganized crazy world of ours operates in a way we didn't know before and that's that frustrates the hell out of us human beings
[01:28:18.880 --> 01:28:21.280]   Because we thought that we could
[01:28:21.280 --> 01:28:24.640]   Reduce things to laws. I mean laws of nature kind of laws and we
[01:28:25.840 --> 01:28:31.360]   Want a narrative right? Yeah, exactly. I'm reading another book. Oh, oh, this is really interesting
[01:28:31.360 --> 01:28:36.400]   See I just happened to have it called. I can't remember what it's called
[01:28:36.400 --> 01:28:43.040]   How history gets things wrong? Oh neuroscience of our addiction to stories. Yes
[01:28:43.040 --> 01:28:48.560]   I love that idea
[01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:51.120]   It is because it says that
[01:28:52.240 --> 01:28:57.200]   We have a theory of line because because we want to figure out when the other person on the
[01:28:57.200 --> 01:29:02.400]   Of the savannah is going to get that half an envelope that was eaten by the lion before the lion gets back
[01:29:02.400 --> 01:29:07.840]   We're figuring out what other people are going to do in this empathetic way and that that is hard wired
[01:29:07.840 --> 01:29:14.160]   Into us in ways that he argues. He's a philosopher of science. The author is one Alex rosenberg. You mean
[01:29:14.160 --> 01:29:17.040]   George Washington didn't chop down the cherry tree
[01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:21.760]   The problem is we we so want narrative. Yeah, we so want stories
[01:29:21.760 --> 01:29:27.120]   He says I want to understand the bonus is narrative history is always always wrong
[01:29:27.120 --> 01:29:30.720]   It's not just incomplete or inaccurate, but deeply wrong
[01:29:30.720 --> 01:29:36.640]   Yeah, it's fast. I'm halfway through so I can't legitimately summarize yet, but it's absolutely fascinating
[01:29:36.640 --> 01:29:41.680]   So yes, they see narrative is the root story telling is the root of our problems
[01:29:41.680 --> 01:29:45.280]   Well, no, that doesn't go
[01:29:46.480 --> 01:29:48.480]   our disconnect
[01:29:48.480 --> 01:29:51.600]   it's it's the root of our disconnect with
[01:29:51.600 --> 01:29:54.400]   machine learning or
[01:29:54.400 --> 01:29:58.240]   Quote data driven everything. I think we're just telling ourselves a big lie
[01:29:58.240 --> 01:30:02.640]   It's hard for us to admit this though because what is our job?
[01:30:02.640 --> 01:30:06.960]   Stacy jeff leo to explain everything story telling
[01:30:06.960 --> 01:30:07.920]   we
[01:30:07.920 --> 01:30:11.680]   We we we diminute we reduce all of the complexity surrounding us
[01:30:11.680 --> 01:30:13.600]   into uh
[01:30:13.600 --> 01:30:19.680]   Understandable intelligible stories we in media. Yeah, this is not a popular stance of mine in a in a general school
[01:30:19.680 --> 01:30:24.640]   This is why i'm an em this is why I don't say i'm a writer
[01:30:24.640 --> 01:30:28.560]   Because I think my job is to explain the way things work
[01:30:28.560 --> 01:30:32.800]   And a lot of times I have a really hard time finding the
[01:30:32.800 --> 01:30:38.080]   Compelling story. I call it the dead baby the dead baby leads it gets the story
[01:30:38.960 --> 01:30:45.840]   Gee wide adoption and the audience and I it makes me sad. So I am I totally believe this
[01:30:45.840 --> 01:30:50.160]   But wait a minute though. I don't think you're addressing the fundamental issue which is
[01:30:50.160 --> 01:30:54.400]   that in inevitably the story misrepresents the facts because
[01:30:54.400 --> 01:31:02.240]   They can't be reduced what I write about I write about like engineering and tech and I always talk to people and i'm like explaining the trade-off
[01:31:02.240 --> 01:31:06.720]   Between this and that and those are conversated. Those are things people don't want to read basically
[01:31:06.720 --> 01:31:09.680]   This is why I like nobody reads my stuff. Uh
[01:31:09.680 --> 01:31:12.960]   Or you need to make your stories more compelling
[01:31:12.960 --> 01:31:15.200]   I do
[01:31:15.200 --> 01:31:17.200]   I don't I don't have the history
[01:31:17.200 --> 01:31:23.200]   Of story of stereotyping and lithography today. I use bookstore here in boston
[01:31:23.200 --> 01:31:25.440]   And
[01:31:25.440 --> 01:31:27.040]   About a new
[01:31:27.040 --> 01:31:31.360]   You get into you get into a narrative. Oh, that's how it was invented. It could have been this that it was that
[01:31:31.360 --> 01:31:35.360]   That's how it happened. Oh, that's what we do remember that wonderful tv show
[01:31:35.840 --> 01:31:37.840]   Remember that wonderful tv show connections
[01:31:37.840 --> 01:31:43.360]   Yeah, who was the guy who's the guy who's the guy when it's all semi conductor manufacturing
[01:31:43.360 --> 01:31:48.000]   Well, it was painting on rocks and then pressing the rock on paper
[01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:52.560]   But oh, okay. It is what it is in semi conductor. Yeah, that's exactly. I was I was
[01:31:52.560 --> 01:31:55.440]   So screening yeah
[01:31:55.440 --> 01:32:00.960]   Okay, that's right. Yeah, it's edging. Yeah, okay. It's exactly the need for commercial
[01:32:01.600 --> 01:32:03.600]   So, okay, good because I have a
[01:32:03.600 --> 01:32:08.160]   Actually have the need to do a commercial, but uh, that was the thing
[01:32:08.160 --> 01:32:12.000]   I loved james berg and I loved connections, but it was the thing that kind of always bothered me which
[01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.480]   Everything was so pat
[01:32:14.480 --> 01:32:18.960]   You know it all fit together and oh wow and you go and you get this great endorphin rush
[01:32:18.960 --> 01:32:25.200]   Because it all makes sense and I think absolutely that's the that's a sign that you don't understand it
[01:32:25.200 --> 01:32:31.280]   This this story is wrong because it doesn't all make sense. It's it's a freaking nightmare
[01:32:32.080 --> 01:32:33.280]   a
[01:32:33.280 --> 01:32:35.280]   Mishmash in the world
[01:32:35.280 --> 01:32:37.840]   So all right, so so I
[01:32:37.840 --> 01:32:41.920]   I'm sorry. I'm just if you go to my medium feed. I don't want you to read the post
[01:32:41.920 --> 01:32:48.400]   I wrote a post about about media education. There's a black quote in there from David Weinberger. Okay, just go to that black one. Okay
[01:32:48.400 --> 01:32:51.040]   Can I do it after the ad?
[01:32:51.040 --> 01:32:54.000]   Sure. You can they will pick up. We'll pick up really worried
[01:32:54.000 --> 01:32:56.560]   Stay tuned for our black quote
[01:32:56.800 --> 01:33:02.240]   Stay tuned for a black quote at least it's not Casper Weinberger at least it's David
[01:33:02.240 --> 01:33:04.800]   our show today front you by

[01:33:28.480 --> 01:33:31.040]   That's cash fly. I know it's there's nothing to do with us

[01:35:54.640 --> 01:35:56.800]   Got the medium post I've got all right. No, no, I'm asking
[01:35:56.800 --> 01:36:03.200]   Because I want to show it. I want to show it. Let me I'll go to it here better reader. What's the name of the uh post
[01:36:03.200 --> 01:36:07.520]   Uh medium medium edge. I see it right here. Okay
[01:36:07.520 --> 01:36:13.760]   Yeah, so listen first champion diversity death to the mass
[01:36:14.800 --> 01:36:20.720]   Is really you jeff. This is you in a nutshell service over product services are ethic be responsible stewards
[01:36:20.720 --> 01:36:27.680]   Boston right now. Yes reach across disciplines is all good. Here's the poll quote. So there's one from david wenberg
[01:36:27.680 --> 01:36:31.360]   Deep learning's algorithms. Can I read it in a voice like that?
[01:36:31.360 --> 01:36:37.600]   Deep learning's algorithms work because they capture better than any human can the complexity
[01:36:37.920 --> 01:36:44.640]   Fluidity and even beauty of a universe in which everything affects everything else all at once
[01:36:44.640 --> 01:36:53.200]   As we will see machine learning is just one of many tools and strategies that have been increasingly bringing us face to face
[01:36:53.200 --> 01:36:55.840]   with the incomprehensible incurcus key
[01:36:55.840 --> 01:37:00.000]   Inker
[01:37:00.000 --> 01:37:03.200]   I was doing so good with the incomprehensible
[01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:08.400]   The efficacy of our everyday world, but this benefit comes at a price
[01:37:08.400 --> 01:37:14.800]   We need to give up our insistence on always understanding our world and how things happen in it
[01:37:14.800 --> 01:37:19.200]   That's scary because that means the ai is going to know more than we do
[01:37:19.200 --> 01:37:24.560]   It does yes, and it's always been case we fooled ourselves all these years thinking
[01:37:24.560 --> 01:37:29.040]   We could tell the story of the universe and we couldn't we were wrong and now the ai is going to prove how we're wrong
[01:37:29.040 --> 01:37:32.160]   And we're going to hate it and moral panic will ensue
[01:37:32.160 --> 01:37:34.160]   You
[01:37:34.160 --> 01:37:40.400]   Well, that was a conversation stopper. Oh, I just gonna give up then
[01:37:40.400 --> 01:37:45.520]   So what is our role? What is our role in all this? We're just the dumb humans
[01:37:45.520 --> 01:37:51.760]   Our role is to look at outcomes. Our role is to say not why
[01:37:51.760 --> 01:37:58.720]   But what is happening and then when you see outcomes that don't make sense or are not optimal
[01:37:59.520 --> 01:38:05.440]   Recognize that those are coming from a a place of either a lack of certain kinds of data
[01:38:05.440 --> 01:38:10.160]   Or because your society is fundamentally structured that way
[01:38:10.160 --> 01:38:13.680]   And if you want to change it and not automate that into the data
[01:38:13.680 --> 01:38:16.240]   You're going to have to go back and address those
[01:38:16.240 --> 01:38:19.520]   I'll give you an example because there is an actual real world example
[01:38:19.520 --> 01:38:23.120]   There aren't a lot of them yet ai's you know a lot of what's called ai
[01:38:23.120 --> 01:38:25.040]   It's just you know a nice program
[01:38:25.040 --> 01:38:27.120]   But alpha zero is a good example
[01:38:27.120 --> 01:38:32.640]   This is the uh, you know kind of the final generation of computers designed to play go
[01:38:32.640 --> 01:38:38.400]   Alpha zero taught itself taught itself by the way it was given the rules of the game, but no positions
[01:38:38.400 --> 01:38:43.920]   No instructions. No evaluations. They just said here's the rule of go shogi and chess
[01:38:43.920 --> 01:38:48.320]   Go learn how to play well in four hours
[01:38:48.320 --> 01:38:51.440]   Alpha zero
[01:38:51.440 --> 01:38:55.920]   Not with any of the rules or stories a humans gave it see that's the problem humans didn't give it any stories
[01:38:56.080 --> 01:38:57.840]   It made up its own story
[01:38:57.840 --> 01:39:01.920]   It got better than anybody else at these games. In fact, it beat alpha
[01:39:01.920 --> 01:39:06.000]   Go the the previous world champion of go that beat least at all
[01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:09.760]   128 games to nothing, but here's the point
[01:39:09.760 --> 01:39:13.440]   Humans look at what alpha zero does on go and they're
[01:39:13.440 --> 01:39:15.840]   stunned
[01:39:15.840 --> 01:39:19.280]   They're stunned. This is looking at the outcomes Stacy they go that is
[01:39:19.280 --> 01:39:24.960]   Because if you looked at the outcome of deep blue the chess machine that beat cosper of it was very mechanic
[01:39:24.960 --> 01:39:27.440]   So you say that's ugly. That's an ugly move. It is
[01:39:27.440 --> 01:39:33.840]   Yeah, but not alpha zero you look at that and I don't know go well enough to know but go masters great go players
[01:39:33.840 --> 01:39:36.640]   We'll look at it say that is incredibly creative
[01:39:36.640 --> 01:39:41.200]   That is a genius move that is not ugly that is beautiful
[01:39:41.200 --> 01:39:49.360]   Yeah, that's like it's kind of like go ahead. Let's Stacy go and then you go there you go
[01:39:49.840 --> 01:39:57.280]   In enders game when ender realized you could when fighting in space no spoilers. Okay. Yes up is down left is right
[01:39:57.280 --> 01:39:59.600]   Yes, so
[01:39:59.600 --> 01:40:04.800]   We have told ourselves a story about like moving through the world and he just upended that
[01:40:04.800 --> 01:40:09.760]   That's kind of the shift that's going to happen as we adapt to having
[01:40:09.760 --> 01:40:13.440]   Machines won't we just turn into a different story
[01:40:13.440 --> 01:40:18.800]   Yeah, well, that's how we perceive the world. I don't understand it
[01:40:19.600 --> 01:40:21.600]   And that's where we're wrong
[01:40:21.600 --> 01:40:23.920]   Yeah, we're wrong
[01:40:23.920 --> 01:40:31.040]   We we're like as children who have said well because my mommy disappeared disappeared behind her hands
[01:40:31.040 --> 01:40:36.880]   She doesn't exist. Oh, she does. Oh, she does. Oh, she does. We're as children
[01:40:36.880 --> 01:40:44.000]   Well, wait, you want to get crazy metaphysical because we only get my marley poster go ahead
[01:40:44.800 --> 01:40:51.920]   I'm just saying like right now even with ai what we understand is what's physically happening and what's visible to us
[01:40:51.920 --> 01:40:54.000]   Those are the problems. We're giving it now
[01:40:54.000 --> 01:41:02.640]   But eventually with better compute power with a better understanding of the like let's say quantum level of the way the world works
[01:41:02.640 --> 01:41:05.760]   We're going to actually be able to see more so in a way
[01:41:05.760 --> 01:41:08.400]   We are like kids because we don't have the tools today
[01:41:08.400 --> 01:41:11.680]   To actually look behind us. Yes
[01:41:12.960 --> 01:41:14.960]   And our stories in the ideal world
[01:41:14.960 --> 01:41:19.120]   I agree with uh, see I would I would love to agree with all of that
[01:41:19.120 --> 01:41:24.000]   And I think that you live in a slightly different world because you don't explain human behavior you explain machines and how they operate
[01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:27.600]   Um, which which which does it gets you closer to that?
[01:41:27.600 --> 01:41:31.360]   But we still live in a world of moral panic
[01:41:31.360 --> 01:41:37.440]   So we have the momos story and people will believe it immediately because they have a belief system and they think it's based on fact
[01:41:37.440 --> 01:41:38.800]   and it's not
[01:41:38.800 --> 01:41:41.920]   and we're not having kids aren't having skittles parties and
[01:41:42.480 --> 01:41:44.240]   um
[01:41:44.240 --> 01:41:46.400]   But there's this this the all true
[01:41:46.400 --> 01:41:50.320]   Tilly n Conway was right. There are alternative
[01:41:50.320 --> 01:41:57.440]   There's a picture of momo. I just I just trigger warning. There's a picture of momo. Okay, go ahead
[01:41:57.440 --> 01:42:00.400]   So I'm just so so yes
[01:42:00.400 --> 01:42:06.320]   But we'll still misinterpret that we may have facts and what what we're seeing is
[01:42:06.320 --> 01:42:10.960]   We'll be looking for some information. It's not there to be found
[01:42:11.920 --> 01:42:13.920]   It
[01:42:13.920 --> 01:42:18.480]   People will find what's really happening
[01:42:18.480 --> 01:42:22.800]   There are scientists. There are people who are engineers. I mean
[01:42:22.800 --> 01:42:30.720]   Yes, there are great swaths of the population who do not view the world that way and do make narratives
[01:42:30.720 --> 01:42:37.200]   But there are people who actually want to understand what's happening great. So only the smart people will be around
[01:42:38.640 --> 01:42:42.320]   No, we'll see everybody. I mean and they're gonna take advantage of us
[01:42:42.320 --> 01:42:50.880]   Dumb people this max of elitism is what like this anti-elitism or whatever it is. It is anti-elitism
[01:42:50.880 --> 01:42:53.520]   I don't want the machines
[01:42:53.520 --> 01:43:03.040]   To become smart and then only a few people on it like string theory. Okay. I I grant you string theory is not a good story because no one can tell it
[01:43:03.040 --> 01:43:07.120]   And apparently the five people will understand it makes sense to them
[01:43:07.680 --> 01:43:13.760]   But they have but they I've talked to many of them like michio kaku. They cannot explain it to a normal human
[01:43:13.760 --> 01:43:17.600]   There's just no way you get smith. You got to look at the math. You don't understand the math. Well
[01:43:17.600 --> 01:43:23.360]   Sorry for you too bad for you. You're out. You're out only five of us can isn't that nice
[01:43:23.360 --> 01:43:29.920]   So is that what the world's gonna be is that there's gonna be a five people and then artificial intelligence and the rest of us are just kind of
[01:43:29.920 --> 01:43:35.680]   There'll be five people part of what David's kind of saying is that for certain things that are happening the data will tell you this is what happens
[01:43:35.680 --> 01:43:40.880]   And there is no explanation and you're gonna tell us what is a human role then is he what is the human role in that?
[01:43:40.880 --> 01:43:44.400]   To make case that's a good question
[01:43:44.400 --> 01:43:47.600]   To make case. I mean that's that's a no no
[01:43:47.600 --> 01:43:51.040]   The human role is to interpret
[01:43:51.040 --> 01:43:54.000]   is to interpret
[01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:59.360]   and stand in between the human or the the ai driven outcomes and
[01:43:59.360 --> 01:44:02.960]   What we as people decide we want to have happen
[01:44:03.360 --> 01:44:08.480]   That's what that's what i've said which is that our job is to make them rules. Yeah, it's to make the rules
[01:44:08.480 --> 01:44:16.160]   Your opinions are making really bad rules right now in the american
[01:44:16.160 --> 01:44:23.520]   Not loss not loss. This is about if you automate something you have to say with the outcome
[01:44:23.520 --> 01:44:27.520]   We have to say what outcome we want right we say and we have to
[01:44:28.240 --> 01:44:34.320]   Tell it to the machine in the way that the machine can understand so just like just like when you're teaching alpha zero to play go
[01:44:34.320 --> 01:44:37.680]   All you're saying is these are the rules. This is what winning looks like
[01:44:37.680 --> 01:44:44.240]   Figure it out. Yeah, same thing. Um, we want to cure cancer. Okay. So this is the this is the data. We know
[01:44:44.240 --> 01:44:50.560]   This is the goal. We want we don't we can't figure it out. Can you and the machine says yeah, really careful
[01:44:50.560 --> 01:44:57.440]   Because like of course right now you could say eliminate cancer cells and the machine may be like, okay can do that
[01:44:57.520 --> 01:44:59.520]   I could totally do that if I kill a person
[01:44:59.520 --> 01:45:04.320]   And that's not that's not a you kind of write good rules. It's not an illogical step
[01:45:04.320 --> 01:45:07.600]   No, but we would obviously that write a better rule than that
[01:45:07.600 --> 01:45:13.280]   Well, there's countless examples of people telling
[01:45:13.280 --> 01:45:16.880]   Computers to do something mostly they're in star trip. They want yeah
[01:45:16.880 --> 01:45:20.800]   No, there's there's actually a tumbler or a blog that
[01:45:20.800 --> 01:45:24.000]   grabs these there's actually a google spreadsheet that has
[01:45:24.400 --> 01:45:29.520]   That's funny. Have you not seen that's no, what is it that that it's a spreadsheet of logic when
[01:45:29.520 --> 01:45:37.680]   Yeah, it's like when you ask data to you ask an AI to do something, but you just weren't really clear on what you wanted
[01:45:37.680 --> 01:45:46.320]   And this this is actually an interesting question because this actually uh harari talks about this in 21 lessons for the 21st century
[01:45:46.320 --> 01:45:49.840]   And one of the things he says is this is actually a great
[01:45:49.840 --> 01:45:52.240]   symbiosis
[01:45:52.240 --> 01:45:56.320]   Uh, because we can't understand the massive complexity of the world, but AI perhaps can
[01:45:56.320 --> 01:45:59.920]   Our job will be to set the goal set the agenda say this is what we want
[01:45:59.920 --> 01:46:04.400]   This is where we want to go and we we can argue that that's politics. That's where you say no
[01:46:04.400 --> 01:46:10.000]   I you know, I want to have clean air, but I uh, and no, but we should have growth whatever you argue that
[01:46:10.000 --> 01:46:16.000]   Once as a polity you decide, okay, these are our rules then you give it to the AI you let the AI do it
[01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:22.000]   But then the question becomes and the challenge of the scary part of this is what if AI develops mind
[01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000]   What if AI develops will
[01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:30.080]   Because it you know and this is the science fiction thing and then says okay, that was a nice idea
[01:46:30.080 --> 01:46:32.080]   But I think I want to do this instead
[01:46:32.080 --> 01:46:38.880]   It falls apart before that leah when ai tells you to close all the coal plants and the and and the coal voters
[01:46:38.880 --> 01:46:41.360]   Get well dubbed by
[01:46:41.360 --> 01:46:43.360]   Absolutely
[01:46:43.360 --> 01:46:50.480]   Absolutely, but the ai can come with up with the right answer and harari says you know what's interesting is there is no evidence
[01:46:50.880 --> 01:46:55.840]   That ai leads to consciousness or mind or will we don't even know
[01:46:55.840 --> 01:47:01.520]   What causes will or mind? We don't know what love looks like there's no functional mri for love
[01:47:01.520 --> 01:47:04.640]   So you don't this is kind of a moot question
[01:47:04.640 --> 01:47:09.440]   There's no evidence that just you're gonna get make an ai that's smarter and smarter and smarter and suddenly it's gonna gain
[01:47:09.440 --> 01:47:11.920]   No, the ai also can't solve it can predict
[01:47:11.920 --> 01:47:16.480]   You can find patterns and predict it can't solve I disagree propose things
[01:47:17.520 --> 01:47:23.920]   No reinforcement learning teaches a computer how to solve when you win a go game
[01:47:23.920 --> 01:47:26.320]   Yeah
[01:47:26.320 --> 01:47:28.320]   It is
[01:47:28.320 --> 01:47:34.560]   It's complex to us maybe not to the ai so weather prediction
[01:47:34.560 --> 01:47:39.600]   We've given it let's talk about weather. Let's let's talk about weather
[01:47:39.600 --> 01:47:43.520]   It's completely theoretically fees weather is a chaotic system
[01:47:43.520 --> 01:47:45.280]   Yes
[01:47:45.280 --> 01:47:50.480]   So it's hard to understand and it may not be predictable, but to the degree that it is predictable
[01:47:50.480 --> 01:47:54.640]   I think maybe chaotic mainly means well, it's just that it can predict eventually
[01:47:54.640 --> 01:47:57.120]   So there are chaotic there are chaotic systems
[01:47:57.120 --> 01:47:59.920]   If there are chaotic systems, and I guess there are
[01:47:59.920 --> 01:48:05.760]   Uh, you'll never solve those but there are plenty of non chaotic systems and maybe it turns out whether it's deterministic
[01:48:05.760 --> 01:48:11.680]   It's just we we can't get all the data points and so we don't know our old we chaotic thus
[01:48:12.240 --> 01:48:18.480]   Title humans are problematic chaos humans are the problem. Yes. I'll grant you that but here's the good news
[01:48:18.480 --> 01:48:20.800]   The ai's never gonna figure that out
[01:48:20.800 --> 01:48:28.960]   Well, I don't know what about the changelog it's time for
[01:48:28.960 --> 01:48:32.720]   The google changelog
[01:48:32.720 --> 01:48:35.280]   bum bum bum
[01:48:35.280 --> 01:48:41.120]   Podcasters rejoice the google podcast app is getting better
[01:48:42.080 --> 01:48:47.440]   It's maturing into a viable option for avid listeners says john fingers and in gadget
[01:48:47.440 --> 01:48:50.480]   It really has always been pretty rudimentary in fact
[01:48:50.480 --> 01:48:57.200]   I didn't realize but you you didn't used to be able to search for individual episodes now you can
[01:48:57.200 --> 01:49:02.400]   So it used to be you could only search for this week in google you couldn't search for
[01:49:02.400 --> 01:49:06.960]   light so exist rect episode of google now you can
[01:49:08.160 --> 01:49:13.760]   So this is even correct your spelling. I hope yes. Thank goodness and pronunciation
[01:49:13.760 --> 01:49:20.160]   Uh, not fully rolled out but rolling out so look for a new version on android of the google
[01:49:20.160 --> 01:49:22.880]   The other thing if I may throw in on that leo
[01:49:22.880 --> 01:49:29.680]   Yes, it's related which is irrelevant to you is that google is also going to start including sound
[01:49:29.680 --> 01:49:32.320]   in search results. Yay
[01:49:32.320 --> 01:49:34.000]   No
[01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000]   Yay, yay
[01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:36.480]   No
[01:49:36.480 --> 01:49:40.000]   Well, like they're not auto playing sound. Oh, please no
[01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:47.760]   Okay, here's what I want. I want the part of this week in google where stacey higanbotham
[01:49:47.760 --> 01:49:50.320]   said her queso recipe
[01:49:50.320 --> 01:49:56.000]   And it searches and finds it and then it and then it has a little play button and you and it instead of just yeah
[01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:58.320]   A link to it you play it
[01:49:58.320 --> 01:50:01.120]   Is the whole show?
[01:50:01.120 --> 01:50:04.400]   Well, yeah, there you go. You might find multiple
[01:50:05.120 --> 01:50:07.120]   results
[01:50:07.120 --> 01:50:09.200]   Um
[01:50:09.200 --> 01:50:13.360]   Yes, and uh and and one hopes and apparently this is planned
[01:50:13.360 --> 01:50:16.640]   podcast
[01:50:16.640 --> 01:50:19.680]   In general search results because they're not right now. Yes
[01:50:19.680 --> 01:50:24.640]   That would be real. They're not in that that drives me nuts because it means I have to write a whole story if I want to
[01:50:24.640 --> 01:50:27.120]   That's right. You need a text adjunct
[01:50:27.120 --> 01:50:29.920]   And we never got around to doing that
[01:50:29.920 --> 01:50:33.760]   Google this is a stacey google assistant has added
[01:50:34.240 --> 01:50:38.480]   support for smart heaters air fresheners and fireplaces
[01:50:38.480 --> 01:50:44.000]   So it'd be warm. Oh good. Oh, that is good. Not malore. Yes
[01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:50.800]   Air fresheners can be turned on and off modes can be adjusted fireplaces can be turned on and off
[01:50:50.800 --> 01:50:54.960]   Um, of course, can you didn't it? It'll spray you
[01:50:54.960 --> 01:51:02.320]   So you're gonna start seeing heaters that say they support google home the iflame
[01:51:03.040 --> 01:51:06.000]   That would be the home kit
[01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:11.200]   How's the burns down is gonna be trouble. Yeah, there's a smart air freshener that works with a lot
[01:51:11.200 --> 01:51:14.080]   Soon it will work with google too
[01:51:14.080 --> 01:51:17.600]   No, I stink
[01:51:17.600 --> 01:51:19.600]   That's exactly I can fix that
[01:51:19.600 --> 01:51:22.480]   I'm very smart. I can fix anything huge
[01:51:22.480 --> 01:51:28.240]   One of the first connected air fresheners was actually linked and part of the works with nest program
[01:51:28.800 --> 01:51:35.600]   Proctor and gamble proctor and gamble did a breeze air freshener device and it was
[01:51:35.600 --> 01:51:41.120]   Conspirity this was actually the product you don't even need
[01:51:41.120 --> 01:51:44.240]   This is this was before
[01:51:44.240 --> 01:51:48.480]   Madam a had a smart home capability. So this was 2014 2015
[01:51:48.480 --> 01:51:51.840]   And what it did is actually it was 2015
[01:51:51.840 --> 01:51:53.840]   CES time frame
[01:51:53.840 --> 01:51:54.720]   and
[01:51:54.720 --> 01:51:56.720]   when your air freshener went
[01:51:57.360 --> 01:52:01.760]   And it spit out some air freshener your nest could turn on so it would blow it around the house
[01:52:01.760 --> 01:52:04.880]   I'm not kidding. Oh, why
[01:52:04.880 --> 01:52:06.960]   a lot
[01:52:06.960 --> 01:52:07.840]   That is
[01:52:07.840 --> 01:52:09.840]   fascinating
[01:52:09.840 --> 01:52:12.880]   And disturbing but I don't believe in those
[01:52:12.880 --> 01:52:14.880]   You heard all the roadie back
[01:52:14.880 --> 01:52:17.200]   So you have fresh roadie for breakfast
[01:52:17.200 --> 01:52:22.880]   So I will tell you I use the I tell madam a to turn on art to preheat my june all the time
[01:52:22.880 --> 01:52:27.120]   Do you it's wonderful. Yeah, he's it smells like a big wet dog in here
[01:52:28.080 --> 01:52:30.080]   and
[01:52:30.080 --> 01:52:42.000]   And now wake you up with youtube music or pandora spotify was added last year now pandora and by the way I want to say
[01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:48.880]   Peripherally pandora now has twits so you can in fact wake up to this week in google if you wish
[01:52:48.880 --> 01:52:52.480]   You can have Jeff yelling techno panic
[01:52:52.480 --> 01:52:54.240]   Wake up
[01:52:54.240 --> 01:52:56.320]   panic
[01:52:56.320 --> 01:52:58.320]   Google maps
[01:52:58.320 --> 01:53:02.880]   Google maps has added the blight of a of a nation lime scooters
[01:53:02.880 --> 01:53:05.680]   to its maps
[01:53:05.680 --> 01:53:08.000]   Now in 80 cities
[01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:10.000]   Did you read the article?
[01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:11.520]   fascinating article
[01:53:11.520 --> 01:53:16.000]   That analyzed how long these publicly rentable scooters last
[01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:18.400]   the and and now
[01:53:18.400 --> 01:53:20.400]   Uneconomical this whole thing is
[01:53:20.400 --> 01:53:23.040]   Guy has to know I read something like that. Yeah
[01:53:23.440 --> 01:53:28.160]   I don't know if which if it was and how often they get thrown into lakes. Well, that's another problem lakes
[01:53:28.160 --> 01:53:30.560]   Yeah, but as a real problem because of blue select
[01:53:30.560 --> 01:53:33.520]   This is from uh quartz
[01:53:33.520 --> 01:53:36.560]   How do you like that quartz app by the way? You like that app?
[01:53:36.560 --> 01:53:39.360]   I can't figure out if I like it or not
[01:53:39.360 --> 01:53:42.720]   It's kind of be like a social network a little bit. Yeah, they've been advertising. I
[01:53:42.720 --> 01:53:49.440]   I use the weapon for content shared scooters don't last long allison grizzwald did a
[01:53:50.240 --> 01:53:52.640]   Data analysis in louville. Yeah. Yeah
[01:53:52.640 --> 01:53:58.960]   100 so basically she found out the average lifespan of a scooter is 28.8 days
[01:53:58.960 --> 01:54:02.560]   G it costs them
[01:54:02.560 --> 01:54:05.600]   500 for $51 to buy the scooter
[01:54:05.600 --> 01:54:09.920]   They also have to spend a significant amount of money
[01:54:09.920 --> 01:54:13.840]   Uh with the city to license the scooter
[01:54:13.840 --> 01:54:17.040]   In fact, they're like
[01:54:17.040 --> 01:54:19.280]   $2,000 for probationary license
[01:54:19.840 --> 01:54:22.960]   Official additional thousand dollars to receive a full license
[01:54:22.960 --> 01:54:27.600]   $50 fee per allotted dockless vehicle daily one dollar fee
[01:54:27.600 --> 01:54:30.720]   And a hundred dollars per designated parking area
[01:54:30.720 --> 01:54:37.600]   So basically here it is louville scooter nomics everybody you've been waiting for this the scooter generates
[01:54:37.600 --> 01:54:42.160]   $3 and 77 cents per ride
[01:54:42.160 --> 01:54:48.800]   Deducting per ride costs charging repairs credit card fees customer support insurance. That's 95 cents
[01:54:49.440 --> 01:54:53.360]   So a scooter makes about $3.32 in net revenue a day
[01:54:53.360 --> 01:54:56.240]   minus the city's one dollar fee
[01:54:56.240 --> 01:54:58.480]   Lime is making two bucks a day
[01:54:58.480 --> 01:55:03.040]   Unfortunately
[01:55:03.040 --> 01:55:07.280]   Unfortunately to be replaced. Yes, the scooter only has 28 days
[01:55:07.280 --> 01:55:10.080]   So it generates about 67 dollars
[01:55:10.080 --> 01:55:12.800]   But they're paying 360 dollars for it
[01:55:12.800 --> 01:55:16.240]   So they're losing $293 a scooter
[01:55:18.560 --> 01:55:24.400]   Math is hard. It's just not surprised me at all. No, I mean, we know uber's lost money for years, right?
[01:55:24.400 --> 01:55:28.480]   Anyway, so I don't know how I got to that from pandaora, but we did
[01:55:28.480 --> 01:55:35.200]   I was like change my way from the story. It says how unhealthy people are using scooters rather than just walking
[01:55:35.200 --> 01:55:41.280]   Uh actually the big problem with scooters is helmets and there are quite a few scooter injuries
[01:55:41.280 --> 01:55:44.160]   Uh, and that's gonna be yeah
[01:55:44.880 --> 01:55:50.400]   Austin all the drunk people run around on their scooters and holy cow it is a it is not good
[01:55:50.400 --> 01:55:55.840]   I almost got hit by them in san jose. You know what I do like though when we were in san moneca, we used
[01:55:55.840 --> 01:55:59.200]   uber has bicycles electric bicycles
[01:55:59.200 --> 01:56:05.200]   And so it's like city bike, but they're electrified and that was really cool and a little I feel a little safer
[01:56:05.200 --> 01:56:10.960]   Google they are they
[01:56:10.960 --> 01:56:13.200]   electric aiden or or
[01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:16.240]   They're electric aiden they're electric aided
[01:56:16.240 --> 01:56:20.080]   Um, I don't so you imagine you're exercising
[01:56:20.080 --> 01:56:23.520]   Yeah, you get a little exercise. I love my
[01:56:23.520 --> 01:56:27.520]   Your legs are pedaling. I love electric bikes. They're the best thing ever
[01:56:27.520 --> 01:56:33.040]   Google's new chrome book app hub showcases the best classroom applications and ideas
[01:56:33.040 --> 01:56:35.760]   They announced it at south by
[01:56:35.760 --> 01:56:42.400]   South by edu which is going on today actually love our berten was talking a few hours ago
[01:56:43.760 --> 01:56:45.760]   And are you going to south by later?
[01:56:45.760 --> 01:56:52.880]   I am good. I have a that should be my thing is to do my talk. Oh, you're doing. Oh, yes, save it
[01:56:52.880 --> 01:56:55.680]   and that's
[01:56:55.680 --> 01:56:57.680]   the google changelog
[01:56:57.680 --> 01:57:06.160]   We uh good news the save the internet act has been introduced in congress
[01:57:06.160 --> 01:57:10.800]   Doesn't have a chance in hell, but at least it could pass the house of representatives
[01:57:11.520 --> 01:57:17.520]   legislation also brings the power of the internet to every corner of the country hallelujah
[01:57:17.520 --> 01:57:23.040]   This of course is in response to the fcc eliminating net neutrality last year
[01:57:23.040 --> 01:57:30.400]   Uh, really have provisions in it for expanding broadband. Yeah, it's good read the read the you want me to read it?
[01:57:30.400 --> 01:57:34.160]   It's not gonna pass. You might as well throw it in. Yeah
[01:57:34.160 --> 01:57:39.040]   No, no, then then I'm not gonna. I'm not even I don't cover that anymore. Yeah
[01:57:39.840 --> 01:57:42.480]   Three pages that will restore net neutrality
[01:57:42.480 --> 01:57:46.400]   Let's it's only three pages. Yeah, it's not it doesn't do a whole lot. I thought it was a real bill
[01:57:46.400 --> 01:57:51.200]   I'm just the bill on capital hill
[01:57:51.200 --> 01:58:00.400]   Oh, did you see this? I love this i'm going to just run through a couple of things and then we're going to get you your picks of the week
[01:58:00.400 --> 01:58:03.920]   A really interesting question the Atlantic raised this
[01:58:03.920 --> 01:58:09.040]   It turns out we can now analyze dna from old envelopes
[01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:15.120]   when people lick stamps and lick envelopes they affect seal
[01:58:15.120 --> 01:58:18.000]   genetic material in
[01:58:18.000 --> 01:58:25.040]   That dna my heritage soon is going to be offering dna testing on old stamps and envelopes
[01:58:25.040 --> 01:58:29.520]   Not cool. Okay. That's what I was thinking you might say
[01:58:29.520 --> 01:58:32.080]   Because grandma can't give permission
[01:58:32.080 --> 01:58:35.120]   Right. You can't give your
[01:58:35.120 --> 01:58:37.760]   so you find
[01:58:37.760 --> 01:58:39.760]   a thousand year old man
[01:58:39.760 --> 01:58:43.200]   Coming out of the ice and the defrosted permafrost
[01:58:43.200 --> 01:58:45.920]   And are you allowed to take his dna?
[01:58:45.920 --> 01:58:50.640]   Well, so that's so what's interesting here and worth
[01:58:50.640 --> 01:58:54.640]   Talking about no, it's not because i'm hungry and it's almost time for me to go
[01:58:54.640 --> 01:58:57.200]   But is the idea that
[01:58:57.200 --> 01:59:03.360]   When we see these law enforcement officials, you know grabbing dna they're getting it
[01:59:03.360 --> 01:59:09.840]   They're grabbing the dna from the suspect, but they're finding the likely candidate based on dna from their relatives
[01:59:09.840 --> 01:59:13.360]   So I think there was a stat that says within the next
[01:59:13.360 --> 01:59:21.040]   Five to ten years 90 percent of white Europeans in the country will be identifiable
[01:59:21.040 --> 01:59:24.240]   based on
[01:59:24.240 --> 01:59:28.000]   Their relationships with other people basically. Wow, that's interesting. Yeah
[01:59:28.640 --> 01:59:35.760]   It was a new york times article new york times did a lovely story about this because there was just another case, you know and so
[01:59:35.760 --> 01:59:39.200]   We do know that's probably not legally
[01:59:39.200 --> 01:59:42.560]   dead people have no rights
[01:59:42.560 --> 01:59:44.560]   legally
[01:59:44.560 --> 01:59:49.600]   Right, but again, this is where jeff gets upset. This is the inference. This is inference based on this
[01:59:49.600 --> 01:59:51.200]   The other prints yet it is. Yes it is
[01:59:51.200 --> 01:59:54.160]   But i'm not a machine learning case
[01:59:54.160 --> 01:59:57.200]   um
[01:59:57.200 --> 02:00:02.960]   And finally, uh good. I don't know what the status of articles 11 and 13 are the uh, eu's new
[02:00:02.960 --> 02:00:09.920]   Intellectual property roll it ahead looking for likely passage there is some good defense though going on from germany
[02:00:09.920 --> 02:00:13.360]   Which says article 13 violates gdpr
[02:00:13.360 --> 02:00:19.520]   What are you gonna do
[02:00:19.520 --> 02:00:23.360]   Anything to say about that. I don't know
[02:00:23.360 --> 02:00:29.440]   If you live in the eu and you want to keep getting twit you might want to uh write your member of parlament and say
[02:00:29.440 --> 02:00:31.840]   We don't pass this
[02:00:31.840 --> 02:00:36.080]   Because we would almost certainly have to turn off twit in the eu. I don't know what else we would do
[02:00:36.080 --> 02:00:41.040]   I just I mean we'd violate the law. I guess
[02:00:41.040 --> 02:00:46.080]   I don't know. I don't know what we would do we'd use facebook don't or
[02:00:46.080 --> 02:00:48.000]   indians for you. I know
[02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:51.200]   I make all my money off of euro
[02:00:52.800 --> 02:00:56.400]   Hey, I got something you can only get in the us right now after shocks
[02:00:56.400 --> 02:00:59.040]   special tech
[02:00:59.040 --> 02:01:00.480]   bundle
[02:01:00.480 --> 02:01:02.480]   I love the treks if you just have you seen these
[02:01:02.480 --> 02:01:09.280]   Actually, anybody who exercises will love these these are bone conduction headphones. They're super comfortable
[02:01:09.280 --> 02:01:12.560]   They don't go in your ear. That's why if you're bicycling or running
[02:01:12.560 --> 02:01:16.720]   And you want to make sure you hear traffic when you're driving you want to hear emergency vehicles
[02:01:16.720 --> 02:01:20.240]   You could still listen nice fidelity. They sound great
[02:01:20.720 --> 02:01:23.440]   You can listen to music you can tune in without tuning out
[02:01:23.440 --> 02:01:25.920]   after shocks
[02:01:25.920 --> 02:01:28.400]   They use a patented bone conduction technology
[02:01:28.400 --> 02:01:32.800]   And I was skeptical. I thought oh come on, but then I wore them and I said wow
[02:01:32.800 --> 02:01:36.880]   In fact now I wear them all the time because you can also use them as a bluetooth headset
[02:01:36.880 --> 02:01:41.680]   So this is the easiest most comfortable way for me to take calls that I love it
[02:01:41.680 --> 02:01:46.640]   They rest gently outside your ear and produce sound by sending many vibrations
[02:01:46.640 --> 02:01:49.040]   Through your cheekbones to your inner ear
[02:01:49.680 --> 02:01:51.680]   Bypassing your ear drum
[02:01:51.680 --> 02:01:57.680]   They're really comfortable really lightweight that back of the band which holds them in place is lightweight
[02:01:57.680 --> 02:02:00.960]   Titanium it's very flexible. It's durable. It's portable
[02:02:00.960 --> 02:02:06.480]   The phone calls sound great. The music sounds great. I listen to audiobooks all day premium pitch
[02:02:06.480 --> 02:02:11.200]   Guarantees a premium audio experience with wide dynamic range and rich base
[02:02:11.200 --> 02:02:16.800]   Wireless bluetooth 4.1 connectivity multi-point pairing too, which is really nice
[02:02:17.280 --> 02:02:21.920]   You compare it to all your phones and I do that because in fact I even use this with my mac
[02:02:21.920 --> 02:02:28.480]   I'll be sitting in my mac and I'll do calls like this. They're unobtrusive. They sound great people can hear you clearly
[02:02:28.480 --> 02:02:34.960]   They charge fast one and a half hours and they give you up to six hours of continuous and music and calls on a single charge
[02:02:34.960 --> 02:02:36.400]   10 day standby time
[02:02:36.400 --> 02:02:38.640]   I keep my aftershocks right there next to the computer
[02:02:38.640 --> 02:02:44.240]   Or in my my backpack because they're great for listening when i'm when i'm out and about
[02:02:44.720 --> 02:02:49.280]   They're safer for driving in any outdoor activities because they allow you to hear what's going on around you like
[02:02:49.280 --> 02:02:52.640]   I don't know emergency vehicles or that car coming up behind you
[02:02:52.640 --> 02:02:59.920]   We have a very nice deal, but again, it's us only it's the aftershocks tech bundle. You get the trex air
[02:02:59.920 --> 02:03:06.640]   A pop socket for your phone a large portable storage case a portable power bank and a travel tumbler
[02:03:06.640 --> 02:03:08.560]   That is an insulator as well
[02:03:08.560 --> 02:03:11.440]   And all of that $50 off if you use the off-recode twig
[02:03:12.240 --> 02:03:20.320]   At twig dot aftershocks.com aftershocks is spelled with a z afte r s h o k z or z
[02:03:20.320 --> 02:03:27.040]   Dot com twig dot aftershocks dot com $50 off the tech bundle if you're in the us
[02:03:27.040 --> 02:03:31.920]   But even if you're not in the us you're gonna love these they sell them worldwide. These are fantastic
[02:03:31.920 --> 02:03:35.360]   We love I love my aftershocks and I use them all
[02:03:35.360 --> 02:03:38.080]   the time
[02:03:38.720 --> 02:03:42.320]   And now because she's hungry. You know I got a question for your first real quick question
[02:03:42.320 --> 02:03:46.880]   My father is is about his death as a door nail now
[02:03:46.880 --> 02:03:48.880]   and
[02:03:48.880 --> 02:03:54.000]   Uh, he gets in trouble in the building lives in because he turns the tp up too loud the bozo upstairs. Anyway
[02:03:54.000 --> 02:04:00.240]   Bullet induction for what i'm looking at you to read reading he'd hear better. He's a solution. Yeah
[02:04:00.240 --> 02:04:04.480]   Hear better. Yeah, it depends on what what his deafness comes from what the call is
[02:04:04.480 --> 02:04:06.480]   Right. Heera
[02:04:06.480 --> 02:04:08.480]   What's a new heera?
[02:04:08.480 --> 02:04:10.480]   It is a p-sap
[02:04:10.480 --> 02:04:12.400]   Uh, what's that stand for?
[02:04:12.400 --> 02:04:16.160]   Hold on. I'm gonna tell you it's personal sound amplification
[02:04:16.160 --> 02:04:22.720]   Product device. Oh, these are the uh cuba cuba's. Yeah, I tried these. Yeah, I am not a fan
[02:04:22.720 --> 02:04:26.720]   Those are pretty good. You're good. No, I wear hearing aids though. Understand
[02:04:26.720 --> 02:04:32.240]   So honestly, yeah, honestly the best thing to do is to get your dad hearing aids
[02:04:32.640 --> 02:04:37.200]   I did that I got some for yes. Yeah. Oh boy. He has. Oh, but he doesn't like him. Does he have modern ones?
[02:04:37.200 --> 02:04:41.280]   No, no. Yeah, he does. Okay. Bluetooth would be a mile too far
[02:04:41.280 --> 02:04:46.160]   Um, but they're never quite good enough. It's just you know, just gonna like correct so much. Yeah, well, that's right
[02:04:46.160 --> 02:04:48.160]   Yeah, maybe tri-bone conductance
[02:04:48.160 --> 02:04:52.960]   The problem is those are boot lutus and that means they wouldn't be great for watching tv because of latency
[02:04:52.960 --> 02:04:58.080]   But you know might be adequate for him the way he watches tv. He wouldn't know this
[02:04:58.080 --> 02:05:00.720]   He wouldn't care
[02:05:00.720 --> 02:05:04.560]   I use my hearing aids to watch tv but also to listen to books and so forth
[02:05:04.560 --> 02:05:12.160]   Uh, but the sound is not full fidelity. I use these new resounds which are better than the older hearing aids. They're really good
[02:05:12.160 --> 02:05:14.160]   They're also really expensive
[02:05:14.160 --> 02:05:20.480]   Have you tried to start to use the hooring aids? Yeah, I've had the liveos and I have now the resounds which compete with the liveos
[02:05:20.480 --> 02:05:25.120]   Liveos do something extra which is they can do your heart rate and stuff like that
[02:05:25.120 --> 02:05:27.600]   I think this is good. What about the eargos?
[02:05:27.840 --> 02:05:32.480]   They just got 52 million in funding this week and they were like, yeah, um, I
[02:05:32.480 --> 02:05:38.480]   I don't see what this is is because next year or the year after I can't remember you're going to be able to buy hearing aids over the counter
[02:05:38.480 --> 02:05:43.760]   So all these companies. Yeah, 2020 all these companies are jumping into this market
[02:05:43.760 --> 02:05:47.360]   Basically, these are companies that make headphones
[02:05:47.360 --> 02:05:54.880]   Uh or headphones like I have a story coming out and I triple E on this exact topic. Yeah, um, these are interesting
[02:05:55.520 --> 02:06:01.120]   Uh, I asked my audiologist about I haven't actually tried the eargos. I tried the iq buds
[02:06:01.120 --> 02:06:04.720]   Um, he said the real problem is battery life
[02:06:04.720 --> 02:06:09.600]   They don't because they're so tiny. They don't have big batteries and so they don't last all that long
[02:06:09.600 --> 02:06:14.800]   But it might be it's interesting again. These are about a third the cost of uh,
[02:06:14.800 --> 02:06:20.800]   Real hearing aids which are extraordinarily expensive. These are only only $2,000
[02:06:21.760 --> 02:06:26.080]   Um, so I this is going to be exploding category next year
[02:06:26.080 --> 02:06:30.640]   And I know you know, I think probably buying hearing aids now if you can get if you don't need them
[02:06:30.640 --> 02:06:35.120]   Terribly would probably be smart to wait till next year when you can get them over the counter
[02:06:35.120 --> 02:06:40.480]   And there'll be a lot of competition and like the livio they'll be doing a lot more than just amplifying audio
[02:06:40.480 --> 02:06:44.800]   Yeah, try you know what? Um, I'll see if aftershocks will send you one for your dad
[02:06:44.800 --> 02:06:50.560]   Oh, well, you won't be able to the go to I have to be there to make it work
[02:06:50.720 --> 02:06:52.160]   Yeah
[02:06:52.160 --> 02:06:54.160]   You'd like them though. There's that yeah
[02:06:54.160 --> 02:06:58.480]   Uh, time for stasis pick of the week
[02:06:58.480 --> 02:07:03.840]   Oh, I'm just dropping so I add an actual pick for you, but then I was like, hey guys

[02:07:12.960 --> 02:07:16.240]   No, we were hoping to uh, but it fell through
[02:07:16.240 --> 02:07:18.240]   okay
[02:07:18.240 --> 02:07:19.680]   so
[02:07:19.680 --> 02:07:22.960]   You won't see leo, but I am at a party
[02:07:22.960 --> 02:07:24.560]   on
[02:07:24.560 --> 02:07:29.920]   Let's see. There's gonna be a link. It is the smart home vip cocktail party where I'm hosting a panel
[02:07:29.920 --> 02:07:32.160]   It is friday at 5 p.m
[02:07:32.160 --> 02:07:34.720]   And it is at
[02:07:34.720 --> 02:07:36.800]   720 barazos
[02:07:36.800 --> 02:07:39.440]   Are your fears of smart home tech warranted?
[02:07:39.440 --> 02:07:45.520]   Um, that is a different one. Okay, then if you have a badge
[02:07:46.080 --> 02:07:52.080]   This is the non-party. This is a talk. I'm interviewing the CEO of august which was bought by asa obloy

[02:08:23.200 --> 02:08:25.760]   Okay, um

[02:09:56.960 --> 02:10:03.360]   Uh, so I met a really interesting academic from university but bersch Columbia named heidee d'forach
[02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:06.640]   uh who has a book coming out about
[02:10:06.640 --> 02:10:09.440]   uh
[02:10:09.440 --> 02:10:13.120]   Germany trying to control media through the first and second world wars
[02:10:13.120 --> 02:10:19.760]   But so happens an article she wrote was used as the basis of a thread that I thought was wonderful by
[02:10:19.760 --> 02:10:22.320]   Icelandic
[02:10:22.320 --> 02:10:24.560]   Twitter asta helga dot here
[02:10:24.560 --> 02:10:32.800]   Goes through from 1850 on all the times that mainly German publishers tried to use copyright to protect new
[02:10:33.200 --> 02:10:35.200]   So funny, uh, tier by year
[02:10:35.200 --> 02:10:38.000]   1850 it's perfect
[02:10:38.000 --> 02:10:44.560]   German press publishers wanted copyrighted news because the newly arrived technology the telegram's rude either business ball rejected
[02:10:44.560 --> 02:10:52.240]   1886 they tried to get in burn rejected in 1908. They tried to limit the possibility of reproduction of news
[02:10:52.240 --> 02:10:54.320]   uh rejected
[02:10:54.320 --> 02:10:55.520]   1908
[02:10:55.520 --> 02:10:57.760]   uh wanted wanted distinction as a
[02:10:58.320 --> 02:11:05.120]   Creative production and non creative information and news regards copyright rejected and on and on and on until we get to now
[02:11:05.120 --> 02:11:13.280]   Articles 11 and 13 they just keep trying and trying and trying again to hide behind copyright for protectionism for their dying
[02:11:13.280 --> 02:11:15.360]   industry
[02:11:15.360 --> 02:11:17.520]   How do you say news theft in German?
[02:11:17.520 --> 02:11:21.040]   Or in islandic or the islandic
[02:11:21.040 --> 02:11:26.240]   That's great good thread 26 the number because there's 26 tweets
