[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.560]   It's time for Twig this week in Google.
[00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.360]   We're going to talk about Google Jeff Jarvis in studio with us.
[00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.600]   I'm excited Gina Trippani will join us.
[00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.240]   We'll talk about the new features at Google.
[00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.800]   How much glass really costs and whether you should buy one.
[00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.520]   And the right to be forgotten.
[00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:18.440]   Do you have it?
[00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:19.600]   How do you get it?
[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.800]   And why Google may not want it.
[00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.000]   It's all coming up next on Twig.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.480]   Netcast you love.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.880]   From people you trust.

[00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.080]   The show where we cover Google, the cloud, the Twitter,
[00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.920]   the Facebook, anything like that.
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.680]   And Gina Trapani is here from her headquarters,
[00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.600]   her world headquarters at thinkup.com.
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:05.080]   Hi Gina.
[00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.680]   Hello.
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:06.880]   How are you?
[00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:07.400]   Good.
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.120]   Good to be here.
[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.280]   Yeah.
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.640]   And she's of course not only the creative think up,
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.360]   but the founding editor of Life Hacker,
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:19.880]   the author of the famous Google Wave book, the elite guy
[00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.080]   that Google Wave.
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.080]   It's so new.
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.640]   It's so new.
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.280]   Well, that she wrote it.
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.720]   OK.
[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.280]   Also a couple of Life Hacker books.
[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.640]   OK.
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.280]   I was going to say, we were the Life Hacker books
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.160]   in the third edition.
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.680]   Yeah.
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.880]   Yeah.
[00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:32.640]   There you go.
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.000]   Third edition, where did that come out?
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.480]   That's good.
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:35.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.120]   You wouldn't let me lose some.
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.120]   Yeah.
[00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.160]   I think a couple a year or two ago now,
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.440]   we're actually talking about the next edition.
[00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.960]   So perfect exciting.
[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:42.440]   Awesome.
[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.480]   I still want to do that Life Hacker show with you in Merlin.
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.760]   I guess you both have kind of gone off to do it elsewhere.
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.520]   But because his work, Men at Work show
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:53.960]   is kind of a life hackerish.
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:54.640]   Oh, really?
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:55.240]   I don't even know.
[00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.760]   Productivity.
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.680]   I've sort of lost track of him a bit.
[00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:58.200]   Yeah.
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.040]   No, he was on the other day.
[00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.360]   It was really nice to see him again.
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.840]   Also here, speaking of nice to see him.
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.400]   Look, he's in studio with his Jeff Jarvis City University
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.000]   of New York professor of I'm Not Pink journalism.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.480]   His flesh tones are real.
[00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.120]   He blogs at buzzmachine.com as author of Public Parts.
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.600]   And what will Google do?
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.680]   And I wish you told me you were going to go to Starbucks,
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:22.320]   because I would have arranged for a better coffee experience.
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:23.840]   We actually bought and expressed a machine,
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.080]   because we were spending so much at Starbucks.
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.440]   Like hundreds of dollars a month.
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:28.040]   I figured it out.
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.160]   I thought six months will pay for it,
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:31.120]   but just for the coffee machine.
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.640]   Have you had the Oprah chai yet?
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.160]   Starbucks has chai from Oprah.
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.960]   Yes.
[00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.400]   Is that South of India Oprah?
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.960]   Oh, I saw Oprah.
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.800]   Is that a cat man do?
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.000]   What is Oprah chai?
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.720]   You mean it's Oprah branded chai?
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:44.720]   She doesn't have enough money.
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.800]   With this woman getting her fingers out of my life.
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.160]   Oprah branded chai?
[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:50.600]   Yeah.
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.240]   Is it like Oprah's favorite chai?
[00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:54.120]   Of course.
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.800]   Oprah's best.
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:55.800]   It'll make you feel--
[00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:56.600]   I like chai.
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:57.480]   No, I'll go down and try it.
[00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:57.920]   I didn't know.
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.280]   See, it worked.
[00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.640]   It made me want to try their chai.
[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.440]   They did not have good chai at Starbucks.
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.000]   That was actually a--
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.560]   What is chai?
[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.080]   It's Indian tea with spices.
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.680]   So cardamom, pepper.
[00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.680]   I can't remember what some of the other chief spices are.
[00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.000]   Maybe a little sememun.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   And it's delicious.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.560]   You don't like chai?
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:20.960]   You never had chai.
[00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:21.480]   I never had it.
[00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:22.480]   It's a spice tea.
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:23.640]   It's something you eat with--
[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:24.920]   No, it's fabulous.
[00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:26.760]   It's a spiced tea.
[00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.040]   You'd love it.
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.240]   No, it's not hippie dippy at all.
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:31.360]   Oh, no.
[00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.960]   It's all you can get in India.
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.920]   Now, if they made Deepak Oprah chai--
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:41.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.840]   Now you got a hit.
[00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.200]   Let's see, in Google land, there is some big news.
[00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.880]   Europe has said, you have the right to be forgotten.
[00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.520]   The European Court said Google must
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.240]   edit sensitive search results.
[00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:04.320]   And people can ask Google to take stuff off of their index.
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:09.440]   There are 180 similar cases right now in Spain.
[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.480]   This is a very popular thing.
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:15.600]   In fact, I think it was the EU's privacy czar who
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:16.600]   first proposed this.
[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:17.200]   For proposed, yes.
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.200]   The Ellie Crows.
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:19.880]   Well, actually, it was the other one.
[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.480]   It's the other one.
[00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:24.280]   So first of all, as you understand it,
[00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.680]   you are our reporter from Europe.
[00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:26.960]   You're up.
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.400]   You're up.
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:29.200]   You've been there, right?
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:29.680]   I'm closer.
[00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:30.180]   Yeah.
[00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:30.680]   You're closer.
[00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:30.680]   You're closer.
[00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:31.680]   She's genius closer than I am.
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.160]   She's about two miles east of Europe.
[00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:36.360]   What is the right to be forgotten?
[00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.000]   The argument is that when something bad about you is online,
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.080]   you should have the right to get rid of this.
[00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:43.800]   But clearly, clearly, that has an impact
[00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.560]   on the other party's free speech.
[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.160]   Well, what you could do is go to the place where it is.
[00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.040]   Oh, I guess if you were--
[00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:50.540]   I don't know.
[00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:53.240]   There are pictures of you in an orgy that were distributed
[00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.160]   widely.
[00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:58.960]   Or the only place you could get it turned off is Google.
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.920]   Well, the original site.
[00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:02.480]   But if it's like 100 sites--
[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.840]   If it's spread all over, then you can probably
[00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:05.560]   cut access to it.
[00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:06.760]   But it's still on those sites.
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.320]   Google's defense would be, I imagine,
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:09.440]   well, we're merely--
[00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:12.120]   Google Search and Index merely indexes the state of the internet
[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:12.840]   as it is.
[00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:15.120]   But the argument that comes back then is, well,
[00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.400]   what's your algorithm?
[00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:20.600]   And they always risk this danger of the demand
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:23.160]   to reveal the algorithm.
[00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.200]   How did that end up on top?
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:26.920]   But this is a really--
[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.640]   Can't Google defend that by saying, well, we have PageRank,
[00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:30.640]   and this is where we use it.
[00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:31.360]   But here's the problem.
[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.680]   They don't have a First Amendment.
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:36.560]   There's no right to free speech in Europe.
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:37.240]   Well, right.
[00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:40.160]   There's not the same guarantee in the same kind of absolute way.
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.960]   At CUNY on Monday, we gave an award to Alan Rusperger,
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:44.280]   the editor of The Guardian.
[00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:47.480]   And Floyd Abrams of the New York Times, who defended the New York
[00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.840]   Times, and the Pentagon Papers, PageRank,
[00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:50.880]   Case, Stone Spoke.
[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:53.720]   And Alan keeps on going on about the need for a First Amendment
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:54.400]   and the rest of the world.
[00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:55.880]   We're the only ones who have one.
[00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:58.520]   It seems like an absolute right to speech.
[00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:01.440]   Even more, in my opinion, seems to reflect
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:02.880]   a misunderstanding of technology.
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:03.360]   Wow.
[00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:03.840]   Oh, I'm so--
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.040]   A misunderstanding of technology.
[00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:07.480]   I think the right to be forgotten is a wonderful thing.
[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:08.600]   And I wish it existed.
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:09.600]   But it doesn't.
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:12.600]   Because you're not eliminating these websites at all.
[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:13.840]   Well, but it's worse than that, though.
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:16.240]   Because what you're really saying is that you're
[00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:18.120]   going to control knowledge.
[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:20.560]   It's a men in black pen moment, right?
[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:21.360]   And you forget.
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.080]   So you're telling the world to forget something
[00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:25.560]   the world already knows.
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:28.760]   That is offensive to the notion of knowledge.
[00:07:28.760 --> 00:07:31.680]   That says that we're trying to control knowledge,
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:34.240]   it's mind control, it's propaganda, it's tyranny.
[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:35.720]   All these things leave that you would think,
[00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:38.320]   if anyone in the world has learned this lesson, it's your--
[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:41.480]   All right, but let me put a counter example.
[00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:45.520]   So you're a person who doesn't have a lot of a presence
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:48.440]   on the internet, doesn't participate in the internet.
[00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:49.920]   That's not part of your life.
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:51.760]   You don't have a Facebook page or a Twitter page.
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:54.200]   You've, in fact, never put anything online attached
[00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:55.040]   to your name.
[00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:58.000]   But somebody, a bad person, decides
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.320]   to write something bad about you.
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:03.320]   That bad person has a popular website or whatever.
[00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:05.280]   And that bad thing gets spread everywhere.
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:08.640]   That is the entire Google search result for your name
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:09.800]   is that bad stuff.
[00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:12.120]   It may even be a lie, may be in libel.
[00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:12.920]   What do you do there?
[00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:14.400]   Well, we have a cure for that.
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:16.240]   That's libel.
[00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:17.040]   It's libel law.
[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:19.360]   We already have that legal mechanism.
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:21.960]   And in fact, in the UK, it's so wacky people
[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:24.720]   from around the world go to sue on libel there.
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:26.800]   So there's plenty of mechanisms to say something
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:27.600]   is set up by you.
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:29.800]   But the other case is, what if you got arrested
[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:33.200]   for drunk driving 10 years ago, and that's online somewhere?
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:34.960]   And you say, well, really, it's been 10 years.
[00:08:34.960 --> 00:08:36.280]   Kids just forget.
[00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:37.480]   But it's public record.
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:39.680]   Not in the internet, you can't.
[00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:41.480]   Right.
[00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:44.120]   And I think that blaming Google is what's really puzzling.
[00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:45.640]   Well, that's the anti-tech part.
[00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:48.760]   That's the lunite moment here.
[00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:50.440]   Because this is just an index of what
[00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:51.600]   already exists on the net.
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:54.320]   And they're saying, well, since we can't delete what
[00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:57.800]   already exists, what if we just control your ability
[00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:59.040]   to find it?
[00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:00.560]   And that's not Google's fault?
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:01.560]   No, it's not at all.
[00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:03.360]   And again, I still want to come back
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:04.200]   to this notion of free speech.
[00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:06.040]   Because in any transaction of information,
[00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:08.320]   there are two parties.
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:12.480]   And if you say something bad about me, and I go on and say,
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:13.520]   well, I just didn't like that.
[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:15.520]   Or in the words of the sense, it's irrelevant.
[00:09:15.520 --> 00:09:16.720]   And I make Google take it down.
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:18.720]   And you want to-- you have the right to be able to say, no,
[00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:20.360]   no, no, what I call Jarvis a jerk,
[00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:21.600]   it's because he is a jerk.
[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:22.560]   It's because I mean it.
[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:24.600]   And I have a right to call him a jerk.
[00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:27.840]   And now that right has been impinged.
[00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:30.080]   So the ruling, which was in Luxembourg,
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:32.960]   because it's the European Union Court of Justice,
[00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:35.320]   was in a case where a Spanish man complained
[00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:37.880]   to the Spanish Data Protection Agency.
[00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:39.640]   It's interesting that you have such a group.
[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:40.680]   It's a fun thing, yeah.
[00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:42.520]   That an auction-- this is the same country that brought you
[00:09:42.520 --> 00:09:44.680]   the Inquisition, just in case you were.
[00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:49.480]   That an auction notice of his repossessed home showing up
[00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:54.400]   on Google, that infringed his privacy.
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:59.680]   Now, the company-- well, this is a quote from the judges.
[00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:03.080]   "If following a search made on the basis of a person's name,
[00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:06.640]   the list of results displays a link to a web page, which
[00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:08.960]   contains information on the person in question,
[00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:13.200]   that data subject may approach the operator directly
[00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:15.560]   and where the operator does not grant his request,
[00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:17.360]   to bring the matter before the competent authorities
[00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:19.840]   in order to obtain under certain circumstances.
[00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:21.600]   The removal of that link from the list of results,
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:29.040]   the judge is conflating the listing of the repossession,
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:30.960]   which is presumably not just--
[00:10:30.960 --> 00:10:33.320]   Google's pointing to a page somewhere.
[00:10:33.320 --> 00:10:35.480]   But he's conflating that with the Google search results,
[00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:38.320]   saying that Google is, in fact, presenting that information.
[00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:41.520]   It has this idea that Google is the internet.
[00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:43.640]   And Google-- this is what Eric Schmidt always says,
[00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:46.080]   because Google is the largest entity on the internet,
[00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:47.720]   anything people don't like about the internet,
[00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:49.960]   they're going to go after Google for.
[00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:51.080]   This is the biggest issue.
[00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:53.840]   The judges said an internet search engine operator
[00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:55.640]   is responsible for the processing
[00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:58.080]   that it carries out of personal data, which
[00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:00.560]   appear on web pages published by third parties.
[00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:02.760]   That is so important.
[00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:05.080]   But what if Google took out any extract that
[00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:08.520]   said what that content was, but merely a link to the page?
[00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:10.200]   Well, look at-- look at Google's perspective.
[00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:13.480]   Now, they have to become the court of what's right and wrong.
[00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:14.000]   Right.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.760]   So I come to you and I say, you should take down
[00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:16.560]   that foreclosure notice.
[00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:18.760]   And then Google says, well, were you foreclosed?
[00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:19.880]   Was it true?
[00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:20.720]   Is this libelous?
[00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:21.760]   Is this wrong?
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:25.560]   Google can't be the court of hurt feelings.
[00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:26.760]   Can't you hear what it says?
[00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:28.800]   It's not even practical.
[00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:30.400]   Well, you know, this is hard.
[00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:31.760]   I mean, I'm going to try and take it
[00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:32.600]   from the other perspective.
[00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:34.360]   I mean, I think in these situations,
[00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:35.880]   I try not to think about it necessarily
[00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:37.520]   from the perspective of Google, but maybe
[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:41.200]   from the perspective of someone who was a genuine issue.
[00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:42.200]   I mean, I don't know.
[00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:45.560]   What if when Etta grows up, she doesn't like the things
[00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:47.800]   that I wrote about her, the pictures that I published
[00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:49.000]   of her when she was a child.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.880]   She wants to be defined other than how I defined her or worse.
[00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:55.440]   You have those sites where like,
[00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:59.920]   ex-boyfriends publish private photos of their girlfriends--
[00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:02.400]   That's a better example because that's so obviously
[00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:03.240]   harmful.
[00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:03.720]   Yeah.
[00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:04.720]   Yeah.
[00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:07.720]   I mean, of course, I don't think that Google can decide
[00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:11.160]   what's right and wrong and decide what's fact and what's not.
[00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:13.400]   But the truth is, I mean, it is kind of privacy
[00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:14.080]   through obscurity.
[00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:16.480]   If it's not listed in the first page of your Google search
[00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:19.080]   results or the first few pages, it might as well not exist.
[00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:21.240]   People can't find it.
[00:12:21.240 --> 00:12:23.720]   Or if someone's been docked and they're
[00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:26.440]   addressed in Social Security number has been published
[00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:27.880]   somewhere for some reason.
[00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:30.360]   It feels like there are so many instances
[00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:36.800]   where an individual who can't practically reach out
[00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:37.920]   to all these third-party websites
[00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:42.200]   and ask them to remove private and embarrassing, potentially
[00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:45.560]   harmful information doesn't have any recourse.
[00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:47.880]   I'm trying to figure out--
[00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:49.720]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:12:49.720 --> 00:12:54.360]   I'm reaching back into my two elderly memory right now.
[00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:57.600]   But wasn't there a feature on some search engine or some
[00:12:57.600 --> 00:13:02.000]   search somewhere once that allowed you to annotate things
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.760]   and say that there was a response?
[00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:07.160]   There was more of a right to response than a right to erase.
[00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:08.160]   Do you remember that?
[00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:09.960]   There should be a right to put do anything
[00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:11.840]   to the Google index.
[00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:13.600]   Well, you mean like trackbacks?
[00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:14.120]   That kind of thing?
[00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:15.400]   No, it wasn't that.
[00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:17.560]   There was some kind of a kind of chat room.
[00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:18.800]   And my crazy--
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:20.320]   wasn't there a moment when there was an effort
[00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:23.760]   to be able to add on to church results?
[00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:27.120]   Well, I guess my question is, is the solution
[00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:29.320]   for an individual, what Schmidt suggested,
[00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:30.720]   that we just have to change our name?
[00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:31.880]   If we do one of the inventors--
[00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:32.880]   Let's be clear.
[00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:33.400]   No, I know.
[00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:34.400]   It was a joke.
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:39.480]   But if I'm an individual who has a history of whatever,
[00:13:39.480 --> 00:13:41.640]   well-documented online, I'm trying to reinvent myself
[00:13:41.640 --> 00:13:42.640]   and trying to be a better person.
[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:44.240]   I'm trying to be a different person.
[00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:45.880]   And I can't get that information out.
[00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:46.680]   I mean, do--
[00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:49.000]   No, the solution is a more tolerant society.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.120]   The solution-- sorry, it's this big.
[00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:52.920]   The solution is a more tolerant society
[00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:56.400]   that recognizes that we all do things that we were mistakes.
[00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:58.520]   We all do things that we're ashamed of at some point.
[00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:01.280]   We all learn lessons and learn life as we go on in our one
[00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:02.400]   attempt at it.
[00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:04.080]   And this idea that off with your head,
[00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:05.800]   if you do one thing wrong at one point,
[00:14:05.800 --> 00:14:09.080]   or if somebody doesn't like that you're gay,
[00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:11.920]   that's the larger issue is tolerance.
[00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:13.600]   But we can't solve that through trying
[00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:17.320]   to sanitize Google of things some people don't like.
[00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:20.200]   Or for even-- so fine, Gina, take Google out of it.
[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:23.520]   And now just say the internet.
[00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:26.080]   So now say that you said something about me
[00:14:26.080 --> 00:14:27.280]   that I didn't like at some point.
[00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:31.560]   I said something stupid like I like wave.
[00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:34.520]   And as a technology genius on this show--
[00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:37.080]   Yeah, Gina wishes I would never mention that book again.
[00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:41.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:44.120]   So just because I don't like it, can you come to me
[00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:48.160]   and say that you have to take down what I don't like?
[00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:49.520]   I mean, so there's the internet,
[00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:51.480]   and there's most people's lens into the internet.
[00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:53.320]   I think Google search results are most people's
[00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:54.680]   lens in the internet.
[00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:58.880]   Does the book-- if you can't find the book in the library,
[00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:00.720]   if it's not in the--
[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:03.280]   or in the do decimal system, if it's not in the catalogs,
[00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:04.680]   no one can find it.
[00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:06.080]   Sure, it exists.
[00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:10.560]   But it's-- look, the reality is that employers, and clients,
[00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:14.080]   and mothers, and siblings, all Google people, right?
[00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:14.760]   That's what you do.
[00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:16.960]   You Google people to find out something about them.
[00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:19.280]   And there might be a time when--
[00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:20.760]   I mean, I get it.
[00:15:20.760 --> 00:15:23.040]   It's a tough issue.
[00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:25.640]   The next step of this is that if Google can be forced to take
[00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:28.640]   it down, then any and every site, including us,
[00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:30.360]   will be forced to take things down.
[00:15:30.360 --> 00:15:32.680]   And we'll be held liable in Europe.
[00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:35.720]   If we say something-- if I say something,
[00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:39.560]   Hairschmitt is a dork, and now Hairschmitt
[00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:42.400]   can go to the EU court and say, you must take that down,
[00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:43.600]   Mr. Jarvis.
[00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:44.720]   I said, no, he's a dork.
[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:46.440]   And this just proved it, because he went to the court
[00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:47.320]   to ask me to take it down.
[00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:48.880]   No, I don't like this.
[00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:49.680]   It is irrelevant to me.
[00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:50.440]   You must take it down.
[00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:52.680]   That impinges upon my speech.
[00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:54.600]   I just can't get past that.
[00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:57.200]   Well, there are some things verifiably untrue.
[00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:01.000]   Someone says something verifiably untrue about Leo.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:01.520]   But overall--
[00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:03.080]   Well, it happens all the time.
[00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:05.000]   It happens all the time, right?
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.520]   I mean, I understand both sides.
[00:16:07.520 --> 00:16:10.200]   But I think that it's like saying, well, let's just not
[00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:14.760]   have an internet, because then this is a problem.
[00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:18.800]   And I think that, unfortunately, punishing Google for this
[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:20.960]   first of all, is ineffective.
[00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:23.680]   It seems misdirected.
[00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:25.080]   I understand what you're saying, Gina,
[00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:26.240]   that it's the card catalog.
[00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:28.960]   And if you take the book out of the card catalog,
[00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:30.960]   it doesn't matter if it's in the stacks.
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:33.200]   But even if you look at things like the Knowledge Graph,
[00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:35.560]   I mean, Google has taken upon itself
[00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:37.560]   the idea that it's this repository of facts
[00:16:37.560 --> 00:16:40.040]   that you can ask it questions and it will give you answers.
[00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:41.440]   What if something is the wrong answer?
[00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:44.440]   If something is untrue, do they become the arbiter of truth
[00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:44.720]   at some point?
[00:16:44.720 --> 00:16:46.080]   Truth is a very hard statement.
[00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:47.920]   And that's a problem, is that this puts them
[00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:49.120]   in the position to do that, right?
[00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:51.240]   They now have to be a judge.
[00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:53.880]   I mean, this is a tough one.
[00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:54.720]   I don't know what the answer is.
[00:16:54.720 --> 00:16:55.640]   It's tough.
[00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:58.320]   And I actually, I tend to agree with both of you.
[00:16:58.320 --> 00:16:59.280]   I'm just trying to--
[00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:03.440]   I like to take the perspective of kind of the person
[00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:04.240]   who's less empowered.
[00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:07.720]   I think this is less about someone calling someone a name
[00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:09.080]   and more about someone who's in position
[00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:11.480]   where information about them, which is either untrue
[00:17:11.480 --> 00:17:14.040]   or which is truly private or should be private.
[00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:15.880]   You know.
[00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:17.360]   But that's what Leo's point is, I think.
[00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:20.160]   Gina is that the horses out of the barn,
[00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:23.320]   the cat out of the bag, we're in a world now where
[00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:26.560]   knowledge passes around quickly, information passes around
[00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:29.640]   quickly, and all in all, I want that.
[00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:31.720]   And it comes with a price.
[00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:35.560]   So we also have to teach people to check things first.
[00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:37.080]   We have to teach people to--
[00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:40.080]   that they do have to go online and say something in response.
[00:17:40.080 --> 00:17:43.800]   We have to recognize that people make mistakes early in life.
[00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:45.920]   These are new realities.
[00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:50.880]   And trying to hold back the technology in their work.
[00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:53.840]   And so we have to deal with that reality, I think.
[00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:59.120]   And meanwhile, you have the freedom to annoy in New York.
[00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:00.120]   Did you know about that?
[00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:02.560]   Yeah, you got a problem with that.
[00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:03.240]   I didn't lose that.
[00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:06.920]   Yesterday, the Court of Appeals in Albany,
[00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:11.840]   in a near unanimous decision, struck down a statute that
[00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:14.320]   made a felony in New York to communicate with someone
[00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:17.920]   in a manner likely to cause annoyance or alarm.
[00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:23.280]   These were actually ordinances used by the district attorney
[00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:25.960]   in New York to prosecute harassers.
[00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:27.280]   Which is an issue too.
[00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:29.440]   It was an anti-troll ordinance.
[00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:32.720]   The case involved a 54-year-old Greenwich Village
[00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:35.880]   resident who waged a year-long campaign, actually
[00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:38.960]   many year-long campaign, against academic rivals
[00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:41.320]   of his father, a Dead Sea Scrolls scholar.
[00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:43.320]   Man, it takes-- there's all kinds of trolls in the world.
[00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:44.320]   You know?
[00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:46.320]   Jeez.
[00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:48.400]   The guy created-- or as a lego, created
[00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:51.200]   sock puppets, false identities.
[00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:53.840]   He opened email accounts in the names of some of his antagonists
[00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:56.880]   and wrote messages confessing to wrongdoing,
[00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:59.160]   and of course, those were not real.
[00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:01.680]   He was convicted of 30 counts of aggravated harassment,
[00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:04.240]   criminal impersonation, that he theft, forgery,
[00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:06.920]   an unauthorized use of a computer, sentenced to six months
[00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:10.640]   in jail, five years of probation.
[00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:15.240]   Now, he's still-- seven of the 10 charges were thrown out.
[00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:18.400]   He still has misdemeanor accounts of criminal impersonation
[00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:19.640]   and identity theft.
[00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:23.160]   But the being annoying part was--
[00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:27.000]   Yeah, and that statute was struck down Cyrus Vance Jr.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.200]   District Attorney in Manhattan says the aggravated harassment
[00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:31.800]   statute is one of the most important tools
[00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:35.320]   we have to protect victims of, among other serious crimes,
[00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:36.880]   stalking and domestic violence.
[00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:38.760]   Here's what we have to figure out here.
[00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:39.520]   There's a line.
[00:19:39.520 --> 00:19:40.960]   It goes over the line.
[00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:42.080]   You've become-- and you're a troll.
[00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:44.880]   We had the story on a few weeks ago about how trolls really are--
[00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:47.400]   Sadist, sadist, sadistic people.
[00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:49.040]   So it is-- at some point, somebody's
[00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:51.360]   going to determine this is an illness.
[00:19:51.360 --> 00:19:54.080]   If you treat it like that, this is an odd comparison here.
[00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:57.720]   But look at Donald Sterling, who is saying noxious,
[00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:01.280]   and abhorrent, and awful, and ridiculous things.
[00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:03.640]   But he also appears to be off as rocker.
[00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:05.400]   And so what we're doing in the media now
[00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:08.720]   is exploiting that fact to get an hour's discussion on CNN
[00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:10.280]   and repeated over and over and over again.
[00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:13.120]   Because he's frigging Looney.
[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:14.880]   And so I don't want to speak about this guy who
[00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:16.360]   was in the court case in New York.
[00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:18.360]   But trolls are generally--
[00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:19.560]   Yeah, little Looney.
[00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:21.000]   And so--
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:23.080]   Seems like you could prosecute on a variety-- as they did,
[00:20:23.080 --> 00:20:24.920]   on a variety of ways.
[00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:28.200]   But apparently, you're free to annoy people.
[00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:31.760]   It's not against the law in New York.
[00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:33.400]   I could-- well, a lot of people do it to me.
[00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:35.320]   I am very annoyed by open mouth gum chewing,
[00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:36.320]   and people do it.
[00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:39.480]   I'm annoyed by tourists who walk slowly on the sidewalk,
[00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:40.440]   anywhere they friggin' well.
[00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:41.840]   And short pants.
[00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:44.000]   Yeah, I've annoyed by these guys.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:44.680]   We got nothing but these--
[00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:45.440]   These short pants.
[00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:46.200]   They annoy me.
[00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:49.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:51.080]   Nonetheless, it's perfectly legal.
[00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:51.920]   It is.
[00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:53.680]   These are legal, and good thing for us.
[00:20:53.680 --> 00:20:55.840]   Yeah.
[00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:58.280]   I actually have to agree that this--
[00:20:58.280 --> 00:20:59.440]   you know, you don't want to take away
[00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:01.760]   tools to prosecute true harrisers.
[00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:03.920]   But I think that there are, in fact, sufficient laws,
[00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:06.400]   probably to prosecute them.
[00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:07.040]   You have yet another--
[00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:08.320]   Step over the line.
[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:11.880]   Another case on Google is in Germany.
[00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:14.880]   There now, an agency is now demanding that Google take--
[00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:16.000]   stop compiling data.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:18.600]   This is that problem-- data across services.
[00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:20.920]   So there's one big Google, and Google
[00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:23.520]   can't act like that anymore, and can't move your data across
[00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:24.160]   from a service to a service.
[00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:25.480]   I don't know how Google survives.
[00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:28.200]   I would just say, I give up, throw up my hands and say,
[00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:29.680]   Europe, you can have yourself.
[00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:30.440]   I'm going home.
[00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:31.440]   I take my ball.
[00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:32.640]   Here's Bing, man.
[00:21:32.640 --> 00:21:33.320]   Go with it.
[00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:34.440]   What if Google did that?
[00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:35.800]   They didn't China.
[00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:37.800]   What if they did it and said, OK, Europe, you win?
[00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:39.120]   If they're a private company, see you.
[00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:41.520]   As the stock would go through.
[00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:42.840]   Yeah.
[00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:44.160]   Because Europe has a hole is a bigger--
[00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:45.400]   Must be tempting.
[00:21:45.400 --> 00:21:47.920]   It must be tempting.
[00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:49.880]   Google has the money and the lawyers to handle it.
[00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:50.960]   I guess they've got people.
[00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:52.120]   They don't need to really pay attention to it.
[00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:53.400]   Yeah, they've got some people.
[00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:54.800]   They're not working long hours.
[00:21:54.800 --> 00:21:58.520]   However, if I were Larry Page, I'd go, gosh,
[00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:02.320]   they basically want me to ruin my beautiful service
[00:22:02.320 --> 00:22:05.160]   and somehow become this arbiter of what's right, what's wrong,
[00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:06.400]   what's true, what's false.
[00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:08.520]   Once again, it shows a fundamental understanding
[00:22:08.520 --> 00:22:11.360]   of the technology is that if Google had come out fully
[00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:12.880]   birthed with all these services, it
[00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:14.880]   would have one privacy policy across all.
[00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:17.720]   It would have one database across all.
[00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:20.040]   And it just happened to add them on as time went on
[00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:21.400]   and then regularize them.
[00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:22.840]   And it's just ridiculous.
[00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:26.760]   And it comes out of this Luddite fear.
[00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:31.200]   Well, in Germany's history of collecting data about people,
[00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:35.080]   I mean, this is a deeply entrenched cultural issue.
[00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:36.480]   Yeah, but there too, Gina, I would argue
[00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:40.880]   that erasing things you don't like is also part of tyranny.
[00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:43.240]   And so they don't recognize their own irony in this case.
[00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:45.480]   So trying to control knowledge and control information
[00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:47.840]   is something you're up of all places
[00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:50.080]   should know is a dangerous thing to do.
[00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:54.320]   So this single ID thing would be simple enough to solve.
[00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:58.160]   If Google put a checkbox up for you,
[00:22:58.160 --> 00:23:00.200]   the first time you used any of Google's services
[00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:06.240]   saying-- because it's without their consent in this case.
[00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:09.120]   If you wish to use a Google service,
[00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:10.200]   you need to give us your consent.
[00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:10.720]   It's not goodbye.
[00:23:10.720 --> 00:23:11.640]   It's not goodbye.
[00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:12.640]   Yeah.
[00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:13.640]   Yeah.
[00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:15.200]   You may be offended by advertising,
[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:16.560]   but you can't go to a site and say,
[00:23:16.560 --> 00:23:17.520]   I don't want any ads here.
[00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:18.360]   That's the business model.
[00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:19.360]   So just don't--
[00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:20.280]   Just don't use it.
[00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:20.760]   I'll use it.
[00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:22.280]   Fine.
[00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:22.760]   I don't know.
[00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:24.360]   The privacy thing is--
[00:23:24.360 --> 00:23:25.960]   I mean, the sharing data--
[00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:27.560]   that's easily dealt with.
[00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:30.040]   But this issue of removing search results
[00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:33.680]   because somebody didn't like them.
[00:23:33.680 --> 00:23:35.960]   Is there-- are they going to insist on a higher standard
[00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:37.680]   than you just don't like it?
[00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:38.960]   What is the standard?
[00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:39.460]   Yeah.
[00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:40.200]   What is the standard?
[00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:40.960]   Well, that's not--
[00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:41.800]   Well, relevance is one of the words I see.
[00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:43.680]   Relevance to what?
[00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:46.360]   It's very nebulous.
[00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:48.200]   If they said, if it's libelous--
[00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:51.000]   so first you have to go to court and show that this is libelous.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:51.480]   Yes.
[00:23:51.480 --> 00:23:52.960]   Then you have to-- it has to be removed.
[00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:54.120]   Then I would-- that would be full.
[00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:55.040]   Then there's a-- yeah.
[00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:55.800]   But you don't have to.
[00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:57.360]   It could be actually a true fact.
[00:23:57.360 --> 00:23:58.120]   Yes.
[00:23:58.120 --> 00:24:00.760]   And just because it happened 10 years ago--
[00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:02.400]   or happened yesterday, it was an opinion about you.
[00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:03.840]   And it's an opinion you don't like,
[00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:05.960]   or something you did that you wish you hadn't done.
[00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:08.240]   We got a few of those.
[00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:08.240]   Yeah.
[00:24:08.240 --> 00:24:09.280]   Get it all the time.
[00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:10.440]   Yeah.
[00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:12.720]   But it's something you and I live--
[00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:13.800]   just live with, right?
[00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:16.920]   I mean, speak for yourself.
[00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:20.480]   I have nothing to be embarrassed today.
[00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:21.000]   I just--
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:23.240]   My solution is to embarrass myself daily.
[00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:24.560]   And then that way--
[00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:26.600]   the overwhelming amount of embarrassment
[00:24:26.600 --> 00:24:30.880]   just deludes the whole thing.
[00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:32.560]   I know what to do.
[00:24:32.560 --> 00:24:33.280]   I really don't.
[00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:35.000]   It's really a challenge.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.520]   It really is.
[00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:39.000]   And I just don't know what the answer is.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.840]   Well, I'm not going to find it for--
[00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:43.240]   I'm reading a book right now on the history of newspapers.
[00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:43.840]   Oh, boy.
[00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:44.760]   Isn't that exciting?
[00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:45.440]   Yeah.
[00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:46.840]   No, I bet it is, actually.
[00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:47.880]   Not so far.
[00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:48.280]   No.
[00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:48.780]   But--
[00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:49.720]   Eat a better book.
[00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:51.120]   It's something I got to read.
[00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:53.720]   But it makes the point that the first newspaper was not
[00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:54.720]   invented, sorry.
[00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:55.720]   Eat out moment.
[00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:56.480]   You're going to hear it.
[00:24:56.480 --> 00:25:01.400]   Get your drinks ready until 155 years after Gutenberg.
[00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:02.000]   Right.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:03.840]   That's what happens.
[00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:04.760]   Invented the press, right?
[00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:07.320]   So it took 150 years to say, hey,
[00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:09.440]   I could use this to spread the information.
[00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:10.160]   Wow, cool.
[00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:13.320]   Yeah, but the first 150 years, all it is print Bibles
[00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:14.720]   and indulgences.
[00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:16.360]   Yeah.
[00:25:16.360 --> 00:25:17.720]   But yeah.
[00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:20.080]   So I was saying that we don't know what the internet is yet.
[00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:24.280]   The change on society is indeed fundamental.
[00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:26.760]   And yeah, society is fighting it.
[00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:29.560]   As societies tend to do, but--
[00:25:29.560 --> 00:25:30.880]   I ain't going to work, folks.
[00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:32.240]   In the long run, it doesn't, does it?
[00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:32.600]   No.
[00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:34.560]   No.
[00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:36.520]   We have lots more to talk about our Google Change
[00:25:36.520 --> 00:25:37.080]   log coming up.
[00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:37.880]   We'll put Gina to work.
[00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:41.640]   But first, a word from Full Sail University.
[00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:45.080]   Full Sail offers both online and campus degree programs
[00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:46.800]   centered on real world experience
[00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:50.680]   in entertainment, in media, in technology.
[00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:53.280]   If you visit fullsail.edu/twig, you
[00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:54.640]   can learn a lot more.
[00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:57.680]   Marketers these days, if you've ever watched our marketing
[00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:01.680]   Mavericks show, you realize it's so much more than it used to be.
[00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:05.280]   You have to be proficient in using web-based tools,
[00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:07.600]   techniques to reach audiences, and consumers
[00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:10.520]   in a digital environment, online marketing,
[00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:14.120]   and web-based channels, search technologies, analytics,
[00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:14.880]   all of this stuff.
[00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:16.600]   How do you learn about this stuff?
[00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:17.560]   You might know everything there's
[00:26:17.560 --> 00:26:18.960]   to know about how to market.
[00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:20.240]   But do you know how to market online?
[00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:23.760]   Full Sail University's online internet marketing master's
[00:26:23.760 --> 00:26:25.640]   program is designed for people who
[00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:28.040]   want to keep pace with marketing technologies.
[00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:30.960]   Of course, it's covered topics like search engine optimization,
[00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:34.160]   social media marketing, web metrics, analytics,
[00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:36.400]   and online consumer behavior.
[00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:40.120]   You'll work on real projects with real clients,
[00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:43.040]   generating experience, and results.
[00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:46.120]   And of course, your instructors are actually in the biz,
[00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:47.800]   so they understand.
[00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:50.160]   Full Sail University's online and campus degree programs
[00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:54.320]   are centered on real world education and experience.
[00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:58.960]   And you can earn a master's as little as 12 months.
[00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:01.560]   Through Full Sail's project, LaunchBox program students
[00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:03.600]   also receive a MacBook Pro preloaded
[00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:05.800]   with Apple's line of-- complete line of creative software
[00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:08.440]   tools, as well as degree specific sets of pro-level
[00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:09.000]   applications.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.720]   You want to know more?
[00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:13.720]   They've got master's programs in business intelligence.
[00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:15.320]   That would be a very useful thing.
[00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:17.040]   I could use some intelligence right now.
[00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:19.720]   Innovation and entrepreneurship and new media
[00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:21.080]   journalism.
[00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:23.400]   Learn more about Full Sail's master's degree program
[00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:25.760]   and internet marketing or any of their related programs.
[00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:29.320]   Check out fullsail.edu/twig.
[00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:37.280]   Full Sail, F-U-L-L-S-A-I-L, like a sailboat.edu/twig.
[00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:38.600]   We thank them for their supportive twig.
[00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:40.440]   The fact that they're advertising on twig
[00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:42.200]   tells you they know a little bit about this stuff.
[00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:42.880]   That's right.
[00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:44.400]   They got some sense here.
[00:27:44.400 --> 00:27:46.520]   Is that a hint that CUNY should be advertising on twig?
[00:27:46.520 --> 00:27:47.440]   Yeah, you don't need to.
[00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:49.440]   They got you.
[00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:50.440]   That's true.
[00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:53.160]   The Dean, Sarah Bartlett's here once again.
[00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:57.120]   We're going to talk later about a relationship.
[00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:57.880]   Yes, we are.
[00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:00.400]   CUNY and Twit.
[00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:01.360]   A marriage.
[00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:02.160]   We'll call it 20.
[00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:03.320]   New York Studio, baby.
[00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:04.160]   20.
[00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:04.680]   20.
[00:28:04.680 --> 00:28:05.120]   20.
[00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:06.160]   20.
[00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:07.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:09.040]   Well, I had to go that way.
[00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:10.520]   The other way I wouldn't have worked out so well.
[00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:12.640]   We're going to take a little trumpet break here.
[00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:19.200]   Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the wrong--
[00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:20.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:21.200]   --sound.
[00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:22.200]   That was my fault.
[00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:24.120]   I pushed the wrong button.
[00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:29.200]   Ladies and gentlemen, Gina Trapani, the latest from Google.
[00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:30.120]   Spell up.
[00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:31.120]   Have you guys seen this?
[00:28:31.120 --> 00:28:32.120]   Spell up.
[00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:33.120]   Spell up.
[00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:34.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:35.120]   Spell up.
[00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:36.120]   It's a new Chrome experiment.
[00:28:36.120 --> 00:28:38.640]   It's a browser-based spelling game for English speakers.
[00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:43.200]   If you go to spellup.withgoogle.com, you can try out the game.
[00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:44.920]   In fact, Leah, you should probably try it out.
[00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:46.960]   I'm an excellent speller.
[00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:47.960]   You are your next-leveler.
[00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:48.960]   Excellent speller.
[00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:51.640]   I know that about you without even having ever been a spelling
[00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:52.640]   with you.
[00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:53.640]   This is fun, whatever's going on.
[00:28:53.640 --> 00:28:55.840]   I used to be good until Google came along and ruined my spelling
[00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:57.000]   because I can just look it up.
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.360]   We were just showing a product review that had the worst
[00:28:59.360 --> 00:29:00.840]   spelling ever.
[00:29:00.840 --> 00:29:03.320]   Let me see if my spelling-- so OK.
[00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:04.320]   It's falling from--
[00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:07.520]   So this experiment showing off Chrome's new Web Speech API.
[00:29:07.520 --> 00:29:08.360]   OK.
[00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:09.680]   My speakers are turned up.
[00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:14.040]   Please click allow.
[00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:14.880]   OK?
[00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:15.880]   Oh.
[00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:17.240]   So you want to allow your microphone?
[00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:18.640]   That's because it needs to use the mic, yeah.
[00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:19.640]   And this is not flash.
[00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:21.040]   This is HTML5.
[00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:22.520]   Oh, I made some noise and it hurt.
[00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:23.800]   OK.
[00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:25.880]   Five meters.
[00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:27.680]   Spell, go.
[00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:30.680]   Geo.
[00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:31.120]   Oh.
[00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:35.240]   Well, that was hard.
[00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:35.600]   OK.
[00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:36.040]   That was easy.
[00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:37.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:37.560]   OK.
[00:29:37.560 --> 00:29:38.520]   So the idea--
[00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:39.960]   You make a tower of words.
[00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:41.880]   Ah.
[00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:45.040]   So I guess it should give you the next one.
[00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:46.920]   This is so exciting I could barely stand it.
[00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:47.640]   I can't hear it.
[00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:48.520]   What?
[00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:49.320]   What?
[00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:52.160]   You can hit the replay button next to the mic.
[00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:53.400]   Spell, play.
[00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:56.560]   P. Oh, here it is.
[00:29:56.560 --> 00:29:58.360]   Spell, play.
[00:29:58.360 --> 00:30:05.480]   P. L. A.
[00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:07.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:07.840]   All right.
[00:30:07.840 --> 00:30:08.280]   All right.
[00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:08.720]   This is--
[00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:09.240]   All right.
[00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:10.720]   Why?
[00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:12.200]   You get the idea.
[00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:12.720]   Yeah.
[00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:13.240]   Yeah.
[00:30:13.240 --> 00:30:15.200]   It's a powerful play.
[00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:16.120]   What's the point?
[00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:17.680]   Why can't I just go P-L-I-Y?
[00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:19.680]   Yeah.
[00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:21.040]   It could be a little faster.
[00:30:21.040 --> 00:30:23.080]   So the point is just to show off--
[00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:24.640]   You know how much I like slow talkers?
[00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:25.640]   Hey.
[00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:28.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:29.240]   They have the right to--
[00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:30.000]   Why?
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.600]   There's an old Bob and Ray routine.
[00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:38.800]   The interview with the president of the slow talkers.
[00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:39.320]   Yes.
[00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:39.840]   Spell.
[00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:41.480]   That's a great of interview.
[00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:44.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:30:44.080 --> 00:30:45.080]   America.
[00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:46.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:50.360]   It's just the most annoying game ever.
[00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:53.280]   You can do that in New York now.
[00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:54.720]   You can do that as legal.
[00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:55.720]   You can do that.
[00:30:55.720 --> 00:30:57.200]   The G-L-A-Y.
[00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:58.680]   [CLICK]
[00:30:58.680 --> 00:30:59.680]   God.
[00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:00.680]   OK.
[00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:01.680]   Next.
[00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:02.680]   I'll play.
[00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:03.680]   Yes.
[00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:04.680]   This is hell.
[00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:05.680]   OK.
[00:31:05.680 --> 00:31:06.680]   H-E-L.
[00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:07.680]   I'm going to hell.
[00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:12.680]   And they will play this game that speed for the rest of eternity.
[00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:15.480]   Maybe if you had a Chromebook, it could be faster.
[00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:16.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:31:16.480 --> 00:31:17.480]   OK.
[00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:18.480]   We can--
[00:31:18.480 --> 00:31:19.480]   Spell.
[00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:20.480]   Play.
[00:31:20.480 --> 00:31:21.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:31:21.480 --> 00:31:23.480]   Spell it already, will you?
[00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:24.480]   No.
[00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:25.480]   You just spell it.
[00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:28.480]   You just shut up because every time you say something, it ruins it.
[00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:29.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:30.480]   OK.
[00:31:30.480 --> 00:31:31.480]   Quiet.
[00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:32.480]   Spell.
[00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:33.480]   Play.
[00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:34.480]   P.
[00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:35.480]   Stop it.
[00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:36.480]   All right.
[00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:37.480]   I give up.
[00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:42.480]   This is not something you could play with a father in the room.
[00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:43.480]   Next.
[00:31:43.480 --> 00:31:44.480]   Next up.
[00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:48.480]   Gmail gets revamped Hangouts on the desktop.
[00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:49.480]   Yes.
[00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:50.480]   That made me so happy.
[00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:52.480]   That made me so happy.
[00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:53.640]   I couldn't get rid of it.
[00:31:53.640 --> 00:31:55.520]   I actually had to close it.
[00:31:55.520 --> 00:31:57.080]   So what was more annoying for you?
[00:31:57.080 --> 00:32:00.280]   The spell up game or the Hangouts new layout?
[00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:02.120]   Right now, Google is an O for two.
[00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:03.680]   I'm just going to say that.
[00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:09.240]   Now, the reason is I show my Gmail all the time and the Hangouts were there so I turned
[00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:10.240]   it off.
[00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:12.120]   But you could still have it in plus.
[00:32:12.120 --> 00:32:14.080]   And did they not have emojis before?
[00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:15.080]   They had emojis.
[00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:17.080]   They have added new emojis.
[00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:21.960]   They brought back the little green availability bubble to let you know if your friend is online.
[00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:23.600]   And they added message snippets.
[00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:27.040]   Just means that when you're looking at your contacts list, you can see the last thing a
[00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:31.000]   person said, the kind of snippet of their last message to you.
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:34.520]   So oh, and there's a new search bar so you can find friends in your list and you can
[00:32:34.520 --> 00:32:36.440]   find friends that aren't on your list.
[00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:37.640]   Oh, I see the green dot.
[00:32:37.640 --> 00:32:38.640]   OK.
[00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:40.800]   So with the green dot next to Dan says he's online.
[00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:41.800]   Available.
[00:32:41.800 --> 00:32:42.800]   Right.
[00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:43.800]   Yep.
[00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:44.800]   All right.
[00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:48.360]   So you'll notice that looks a little different in Gmail and also use if you use the Hangouts
[00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:52.760]   extension for Chrome, which I do, you'll also get the availability bubbles and message
[00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:53.760]   snippets.
[00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:55.760]   Oh, there's a Hangouts extension for Chrome.
[00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:56.760]   Mm-hmm.
[00:32:56.760 --> 00:32:58.160]   Oh, I should put that in here.
[00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:00.200]   Yeah, it kind of puts it in a separate window.
[00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:01.200]   All right.
[00:33:01.200 --> 00:33:02.200]   What else do we have?
[00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:03.200]   I use it for the show.
[00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:04.200]   I can use that.
[00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:05.200]   A-chad.
[00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:06.200]   Yay.
[00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:07.200]   I love Hangouts extension.
[00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:08.200]   You use it too.
[00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:09.840]   Yeah, it's now it's replaced.
[00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:12.200]   I used to use, you know, an XMPP.
[00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:13.200]   Google talk.
[00:33:13.200 --> 00:33:14.200]   Google talk.
[00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:15.200]   Yeah.
[00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:19.120]   And yeah, now the Hangouts extension has replaced everything because it's like a-- it's that
[00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:22.520]   separate application sort of thing that they rolled out where it can--
[00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:23.520]   Yeah.
[00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:24.520]   --it can run--
[00:33:24.520 --> 00:33:25.520]   Show us up and agree it and all that.
[00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:26.520]   Yeah.
[00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:28.880]   Well, yeah, it can run when your Chrome isn't up and running.
[00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:29.880]   It can?
[00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:30.880]   Yeah.
[00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:36.360]   So I do that on the PC is-- it'll now be at the top of your bar, your PC bar.
[00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:38.360]   And it's just the little--
[00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:39.360]   Huh.
[00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:40.360]   Hangouts--
[00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:41.360]   Hey, does it--
[00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:42.840]   I didn't know about this, huh?
[00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:44.440]   Yeah, it's quite nice.
[00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:47.320]   It's the thing that has replaced, you know, Trillion and--
[00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:48.320]   Right.
[00:33:48.320 --> 00:33:49.320]   --Policry and--
[00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:50.320]   Right.
[00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:51.320]   --Lose thing.
[00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:52.320]   Yeah, it's a switch, chat client.
[00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:53.320]   Right, exactly.
[00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:54.320]   Mm-hmm.
[00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:55.320]   Oh, yeah, there it is.
[00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:56.320]   Cool.
[00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:57.320]   So it's going to have all those new features as well.
[00:33:57.320 --> 00:33:58.320]   Yes, it will.
[00:33:58.320 --> 00:33:59.320]   I will.
[00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:00.320]   You know, I can't even remember.
[00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:02.320]   How do I get to the web store to get one?
[00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:03.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:04.320]   Hangout.
[00:34:04.320 --> 00:34:05.320]   Me, Gina.
[00:34:05.320 --> 00:34:06.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:07.320]   We're old.
[00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:10.760]   I always have to go to settings, extensions, get more extensions.
[00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:12.360]   I just googled the only--
[00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:14.960]   Hangout extension, and that pretty much worked.
[00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:18.440]   So I'm just saying, let me Google that for you, Jeff.
[00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:19.440]   Yeah, I would just Google that.
[00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:20.440]   What happened?
[00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:22.280]   The experts in the world right here--
[00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:23.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:24.600]   --is a friend of question.
[00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:25.600]   Geez.
[00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:26.600]   Hangout.
[00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:28.080]   So I don't know, actually, the answer.
[00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:30.080]   No, I'll admit, I have to Google it every time myself.
[00:34:30.080 --> 00:34:31.080]   Yeah, just Google it in a bit.
[00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:32.080]   Because I don't know the URL.
[00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:33.520]   It used to be-- yeah, there it is.
[00:34:33.520 --> 00:34:36.200]   It used to be that when you got a new tab that was on there.
[00:34:36.200 --> 00:34:38.680]   So my mood is now-- is not a text.
[00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:41.760]   It is an emoji.
[00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:44.200]   OK, so my mood is now an emoji.
[00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:45.120]   All right.
[00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:48.240]   One of my students is going to do a business based on emojis.
[00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:49.040]   Yeah.
[00:34:49.040 --> 00:34:50.120]   Don't ask me how it's called.
[00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:51.120]   It's called a static button.
[00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:52.560]   It's called path.
[00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:55.120]   OK, more options.
[00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:55.520]   All right, good.
[00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:56.640]   This is cool.
[00:34:56.640 --> 00:34:58.160]   Signing on Hangout's on Chrome starts.
[00:34:58.160 --> 00:34:59.480]   Keep Hangout's on top of other with us.
[00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:01.120]   Show system tray icon.
[00:35:01.120 --> 00:35:03.520]   So that kind of keeps it semi-permanent, just floating here.
[00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:04.520]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:05.520]   Need.
[00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:07.160]   Mm-hmm.
[00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:10.400]   Moving over to iOS, Google Search 4.0 for iOS.
[00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:13.280]   Add a few options that we already have on Android.
[00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:16.160]   New voice search options and more relevant results.
[00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:18.040]   So the app recognizes virtual voice search
[00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:19.480]   cues and conversational input.
[00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:22.320]   So you can say to the app, what's the weather like?
[00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:24.640]   And when you get results, you can follow up with,
[00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:25.840]   how about this weekend?
[00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:28.080]   You look at the results for the coming weekend.
[00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:30.960]   And like it does on Android, the app on iOS
[00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:33.880]   will now also alert you when new articles on certain topics
[00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:34.440]   appear.
[00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:35.880]   And that's powered by Google now.
[00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:37.080]   I don't know if you guys have seen this.
[00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:40.040]   Google now cards, which is like updates to websites
[00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:42.960]   you visited or suggesting articles about things
[00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:45.920]   you've searched for before.
[00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:48.560]   I got the notification for the new Justin Bieber album.
[00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:49.560]   Ooh.
[00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:50.560]   Is that out?
[00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:51.060]   Yeah.
[00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:53.240]   Ooh.
[00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:54.240]   So that's all I know about that.
[00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:56.160]   I got Bieber-Fever.
[00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:56.880]   You're a believer.
[00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:59.160]   I'm a believer.
[00:35:59.160 --> 00:36:02.280]   Google's Knowledge Graph now extends into Google Maps.
[00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:04.800]   As we've researched for certain locations,
[00:36:04.800 --> 00:36:06.960]   you'll get a Quick Facts card that'll
[00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:09.480]   tell you some information about that place.
[00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:10.920]   So if you search for the space needle,
[00:36:10.920 --> 00:36:12.760]   or you search for Brooklyn Bridge--
[00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:14.600]   Yeah, the other problem is you don't want to irritate me
[00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:15.680]   about maps.
[00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:19.080]   Is that all that big box on there takes up the map?
[00:36:19.080 --> 00:36:20.040]   I can close it, can't you?
[00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:21.560]   I know, but then I'm going to do that all the time.
[00:36:21.560 --> 00:36:22.840]   And it irritates me.
[00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:24.720]   In my test, it was collapsed by default.
[00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:27.600]   So actually, yeah, it was kind of there are cards that
[00:36:27.600 --> 00:36:29.800]   are stacked, and you have to click on the Quick Facts
[00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:31.920]   card in order to expand it.
[00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:35.680]   So we'll take up all the side by default.
[00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:39.600]   Google Wallet updated for Android and iOS, actually,
[00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:41.680]   and it introduces multiple accounts.
[00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:44.160]   So if you launch Google Wallet, you
[00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:45.920]   can now switch between your Google accounts
[00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:48.360]   and set a separate pin for each account.
[00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:49.720]   So that's nice for people.
[00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:51.880]   Folks like us who have multiple accounts.
[00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:53.920]   And we talked about this a couple of episodes ago,
[00:36:53.920 --> 00:36:56.000]   but the Google Drive update that rolled out this week,
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:59.040]   that finally officially removes document editing.
[00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:01.400]   So it's read-only and search-only.
[00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:05.240]   If you want to edit your sheets or docs,
[00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:09.080]   you have to install the separate sheets and docs apps,
[00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:11.360]   which let you edit both online and offline.
[00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:14.640]   So it's a little annoying when you first go in to drive
[00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:16.000]   and tap on a document.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.160]   But once you get the other app, you
[00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:18.840]   have all the functionality it used to have.
[00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:23.600]   They've just separated it out into these different apps.
[00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:24.240]   And that's it.
[00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:25.080]   That's all I got?
[00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:27.720]   That is the Google change log.
[00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:29.720]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:32.800]   So boom, boom, boom.
[00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:35.240]   Thank you, Gina Trapani.
[00:37:35.240 --> 00:37:35.720]   You're welcome.
[00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:36.400]   We're going to take a break.
[00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:38.880]   When we come back, we'll tell you how you-- yes, you-- can
[00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:42.800]   own Google Glass of your very own.
[00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:44.160]   Because I'll sell you one.
[00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:45.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:46.200]   Really?
[00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:49.320]   With Jeff's prescription, built in.
[00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:51.360]   Our show today brought to you by 99 designs,
[00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:54.720]   the world's largest graphic design marketplace.
[00:37:54.720 --> 00:37:56.600]   What is the current count of 99 designs?
[00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:59.520]   I think they cross 300,000 designers.
[00:37:59.520 --> 00:38:02.400]   They're all waiting for you at 99designs.com.
[00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:03.800]   You stop by.
[00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:06.640]   Yep, 301,481.
[00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:10.440]   The tote board has turned over once again.
[00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:12.440]   That is a big community of designers.
[00:38:12.440 --> 00:38:14.280]   And they're waiting for you to start.
[00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:16.120]   They call it a design contest.
[00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:19.160]   You could say a request for a design or something.
[00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:24.160]   The idea is you go there for your logo for app design,
[00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:27.960]   business card design, web page design, get a t-shirt.
[00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:30.280]   We get t-shirts frequently from 99designs.
[00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:33.280]   Our latest tote design is a 99designs design.
[00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:36.200]   So you post the projects, see how much you're willing to pay.
[00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:41.480]   Designers will then flock to you and offer you ideas.
[00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:42.880]   You can refine it with a designer.
[00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:46.880]   Pick one, pay them, and you get the design.
[00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:49.400]   Projects started just $199.
[00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:53.560]   And your happiness is always 100% guaranteed.
[00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:54.680]   The designers love it.
[00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:55.680]   You will love it too.
[00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:59.280]   In fact, $2 million in payouts to designers last month,
[00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:02.760]   last month alone.
[00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:06.960]   It's a hub for design talent and for people who need design
[00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:08.400]   work, 99designs.
[00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:09.960]   I'm from New York.
[00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:11.080]   No, you can leave it up.
[00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:12.080]   This is one of the designers.
[00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:15.480]   It's a little small island, close to an island.
[00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:17.440]   It was a fog forgotten burr.
[00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:19.240]   I'm actually here in San Francisco
[00:39:19.240 --> 00:39:21.960]   because of an awesome opportunity that presented itself
[00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:23.120]   through 99designs.
[00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:25.560]   Working on a pretty exciting project
[00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:28.280]   that involved picking on their entire product branding
[00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:29.120]   from the ground up.
[00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:31.280]   I've always been designing.
[00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:31.760]   San Ty was--
[00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:33.000]   It's a neat story.
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.880]   Seven, and watching my dad do--
[00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:37.400]   he wanted to be an architect at one time.
[00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:40.240]   The thing that really inspires me about architecture
[00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:43.680]   is just the user experience element of it all,
[00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:45.120]   where you can see a building that
[00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:46.600]   could look a certain way.
[00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:47.800]   But then when you enter--
[00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:51.760]   You can see the rest of the video at 99designs.com.
[00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:53.640]   A neat story about Nicholas, who became--
[00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:56.160]   who's a 99designs designer, who actually got a pretty darn
[00:39:56.160 --> 00:39:57.800]   good gig out of it.
[00:39:57.800 --> 00:39:59.760]   If you have design work you need done,
[00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:03.200]   just go to 99designs.com/twig.
[00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:06.120]   And we're going to give you a $99 power pack of services
[00:40:06.120 --> 00:40:09.480]   absolutely free that gives you more designer time and attention.
[00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:12.520]   They'll bold, highlight, and feature your design project,
[00:40:12.520 --> 00:40:14.160]   the 99designs marketplace.
[00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:15.920]   And you'll get nearly twice as many designs.
[00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:22.280]   99designs.com/twig, an army of designers
[00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:26.480]   is waiting for you right there right now.
[00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:27.840]   They're going to do--
[00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:29.800]   they have a lot of interesting things in the works.
[00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:32.080]   I probably shouldn't talk about it until it happens.
[00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:33.720]   One of the things they're going to have as an offer
[00:40:33.720 --> 00:40:35.840]   is a whole logo kit.
[00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:41.320]   So you get the logo design, but then you get letterhead.
[00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:43.960]   It looks even more dorky with the wire hanging off.
[00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:48.960]   Now you look really bizarre.
[00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:51.960]   The reality of Google Glass is it is generally out of juice.
[00:40:51.960 --> 00:40:54.640]   How much-- so Jeff Jarvis is wearing his glass.
[00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:57.120]   How much battery life do you typically get on that?
[00:40:57.120 --> 00:40:58.280]   Well, I forget to turn on.
[00:40:58.280 --> 00:40:59.440]   I leave it in the bag.
[00:40:59.440 --> 00:41:00.800]   It goes on somehow.
[00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:01.680]   By itself.
[00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:02.640]   Yeah.
[00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:05.480]   So Google is now apparently, as far as we can tell,
[00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:07.520]   saying anybody wants it can have it.
[00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:08.760]   It's still $1,500.
[00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:11.600]   This is not the final version.
[00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:14.400]   This is still the kind of the Glass Explorer.
[00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:15.760]   Yeah, it's the Explorer edition.
[00:41:15.760 --> 00:41:17.880]   It's a more open beta.
[00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:20.600]   But you get a free pair of the titanium collection
[00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:23.000]   frames, which is nice.
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:24.160]   You have to buy those separately.
[00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:25.000]   Free, huh?
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:26.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:26.920]   Free.
[00:41:26.920 --> 00:41:27.960]   Free.
[00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:29.440]   And of course, it's US only.
[00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:32.520]   And it's for as long as they have glass in stock.
[00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:33.120]   So this would--
[00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:34.800]   but it sounds just kind of open.
[00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:36.520]   That they're not going to do a consumer version.
[00:41:36.520 --> 00:41:37.920]   See, that was always my contention,
[00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:39.760]   as I didn't think they were.
[00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:42.400]   Certainly, if they do this, you bought $1,500.
[00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:44.200]   And in three months, they announced a $300 one.
[00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:45.360]   You're going to be peeved.
[00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:48.160]   And by the way, there's some speculation.
[00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:49.720]   I'm seeing a number of articles saying
[00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:52.880]   that the Glass cost as little as $150 for Google.
[00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:54.480]   There was a new teardown we have in the run--
[00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:56.320]   From IHS, yeah.
[00:41:56.320 --> 00:41:56.760]   A little bit more.
[00:41:56.760 --> 00:41:58.760]   Now, they point out that--
[00:41:58.760 --> 00:42:00.320]   yes, $152.
[00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:03.640]   They point out that much of the cost of a device
[00:42:03.640 --> 00:42:05.280]   like this comes from engineering and development.
[00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:06.240]   Well, yeah.
[00:42:06.240 --> 00:42:11.520]   But it's not like you try to get all the costs from 5 people.
[00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:13.480]   The $80, yeah.
[00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:15.600]   The Tesla from the first five fires.
[00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:16.120]   Right.
[00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:19.080]   I mean, I think it's reasonable to say Glass should be expected.
[00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:22.000]   By the way, we reported a month ago a teardown
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:23.440]   that said it was $80.
[00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:28.120]   But even if it's $150 or $300, $1,500, let's say it's $300.
[00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:30.200]   Maybe they're off by a factor of two.
[00:42:30.200 --> 00:42:31.240]   And it's $300.
[00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:33.400]   It's still five times more than the cost.
[00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:36.120]   How much of a shmuck am I?
[00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:38.280]   I bought one too.
[00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:39.400]   Do we show last week, Chad?
[00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:43.800]   Did we show Jason Hall's glass video of Savannah walking?
[00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:45.120]   No, we didn't show this.
[00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:49.600]   Jason Hall's video shows the single best reason to have.
[00:42:49.600 --> 00:42:50.000]   It's great.
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:51.280]   We showed up all of it, Andrew.
[00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:51.960]   I'd love to find it.
[00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:53.200]   It was a thing, Dad.
[00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:54.520]   Yeah.
[00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:55.520]   It is just.
[00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:57.880]   And you gave me props, Jeff.
[00:42:57.880 --> 00:43:01.520]   And I thank you on Google+ saying Leo bought this for Jason.
[00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:03.320]   That's exactly why I bought it for Jason.
[00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:03.680]   Because--
[00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:05.320]   Greatest thing in the world.
[00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:09.320]   I-- unlike Jason, I didn't have a-- he had a newborn.
[00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:12.760]   And I thought, boy, this is going to really be great for him.
[00:43:12.760 --> 00:43:15.240]   The first time here is Savannah wearing glasses.
[00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:16.000]   This is so great.
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:16.840]   This makes me so happy.
[00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:17.400]   This is his daughter.
[00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:19.320]   He stayed home that day from work.
[00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:20.560]   She was a little cranky.
[00:43:20.560 --> 00:43:21.160]   He had a fever.
[00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:22.320]   Didn't feel well.
[00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:23.240]   But I don't, for some reason--
[00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:24.760]   He's torturing her now.
[00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:26.640]   I have my-- your boy and your dog.
[00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:27.280]   Look.
[00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:28.880]   Cheating a little bit.
[00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:30.160]   You can think of that.
[00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:31.920]   So Jason's wearing glasses.
[00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:34.520]   That means he's got direct contact with Savannah.
[00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:36.680]   She doesn't think that as a camera.
[00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:38.200]   I will give that one to you.
[00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:39.200]   Oh, baby.
[00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:39.960]   It's the greatest.
[00:43:39.960 --> 00:43:40.800]   And here she goes.
[00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:41.880]   This is all by herself.
[00:43:41.880 --> 00:43:43.240]   She's going to take a couple more steps.
[00:43:43.240 --> 00:43:44.520]   She's like, oh, yeah, I'm good.
[00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:45.920]   That is such an important moment.
[00:43:45.920 --> 00:43:47.840]   As you know, her first step--
[00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:51.120]   6, 7.
[00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:52.920]   That makes it all worth-- for me, $1,500.
[00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:54.440]   It's worth it for a moment.
[00:43:54.440 --> 00:43:55.040]   Right there.
[00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:56.160]   Because Jason has that.
[00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:57.680]   And I remember who doesn't--
[00:43:57.680 --> 00:43:59.240]   they're babies for steps.
[00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:01.400]   I remember Abby and Henry's first steps absolutely.
[00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:02.480]   I'll never forget it.
[00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:04.160]   I wasn't there for Abby's.
[00:44:04.160 --> 00:44:05.640]   And I was there for Henry's.
[00:44:05.640 --> 00:44:08.200]   His first steps were at a rest stop between here
[00:44:08.200 --> 00:44:09.800]   and Reading California.
[00:44:09.800 --> 00:44:12.600]   Hey, I'm not going to Reading.
[00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:14.840]   It's too hot.
[00:44:14.840 --> 00:44:15.520]   But I remember that.
[00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:16.560]   But I don't have video of him.
[00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:17.480]   And I never would.
[00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:20.280]   But I think that's really great that Jason does have that.
[00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:20.680]   It's great.
[00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:21.600]   I still have a shot.
[00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:23.480]   Jason's raised the bar very high.
[00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:24.360]   Edda's really late.
[00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:25.840]   She hasn't walked out her own yet.
[00:44:25.840 --> 00:44:26.600]   She cruises.
[00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:27.600]   She holds on and cruises.
[00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:29.000]   But she hasn't started walking yet.
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:30.680]   So now that I've seen that, I'm like, oh, man,
[00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:32.000]   I've got to just wear a glass every minute
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:33.800]   and I'm with her because she's so close.
[00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:34.920]   She's so close to let me go.
[00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:36.560]   With glass, there's some serendipity
[00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:38.240]   to having the being there at the right time.
[00:44:38.240 --> 00:44:38.800]   It's true.
[00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:39.680]   It's true.
[00:44:39.680 --> 00:44:42.400]   I wasn't even in the room when Abby walked.
[00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:46.040]   So anyway, I don't know.
[00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:47.480]   Where do you go if you want to--
[00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:48.520]   Anybody in the gym room?
[00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:49.560]   Anybody want to buy glass?
[00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:50.760]   Some people want-- I mean, your glass?
[00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:51.800]   No, well, no, not too.
[00:44:51.800 --> 00:44:53.560]   No, I don't think anybody wants to buy glass.
[00:44:53.560 --> 00:44:56.200]   It's too expensive.
[00:44:56.200 --> 00:44:57.000]   Where do we get it?
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:58.920]   Do we go to glass.google.com?
[00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:00.920]   I mean, the project page--
[00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:03.120]   does it have how to buy it?
[00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:07.320]   I don't know.
[00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:09.480]   Look, yeah, yep, yep.
[00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:12.400]   Yep, google.com/glass/start.
[00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:12.900]   OK.
[00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:16.360]   Become an explorer and you click on Come and Explore
[00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:16.760]   and you can go to--
[00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:17.600]   Anybody can do it.
[00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:18.240]   Choose your color.
[00:45:18.240 --> 00:45:18.800]   Choose your color.
[00:45:18.800 --> 00:45:19.760]   Choose your frames.
[00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:20.280]   Wow.
[00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:21.120]   Choose your shades.
[00:45:21.120 --> 00:45:22.600]   Ooh, they got different shades, too.
[00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:23.920]   I didn't see the different shades.
[00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:25.680]   So you got Skye.
[00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:27.360]   You got Chaco out of stock.
[00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:28.680]   Tangerine.
[00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:30.360]   Definitely not out of stock.
[00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:32.360]   Cotton.
[00:45:32.360 --> 00:45:34.440]   Just really just gray, OK?
[00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:37.240]   Shale, which is just a darker gray.
[00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:39.120]   Which one would-- I'll get the orange.
[00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:42.080]   Might as well if you're going to wear it, announce it.
[00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:44.360]   Select your complementary accessory.
[00:45:44.360 --> 00:45:45.520]   I'm not supposed to miss this video.
[00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:45.840]   I spent a few bucks.
[00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:47.440]   You didn't get this.
[00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:49.960]   For featherlight, titanium frames.
[00:45:49.960 --> 00:45:51.400]   Oh, but these are for prescription.
[00:45:51.400 --> 00:45:52.520]   Yeah, I just got to--
[00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:53.400]   Which ones did you get?
[00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:56.320]   The curve, bold, split, or thin?
[00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:58.200]   Or would you like shade?
[00:45:58.200 --> 00:45:59.400]   Can you only get one?
[00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:00.640]   I got thin, I think.
[00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:04.680]   So I can get sunglasses from Maui Gym.
[00:46:04.680 --> 00:46:06.840]   $2.45.
[00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:09.400]   Your frames look really good, Jeff.
[00:46:09.400 --> 00:46:10.600]   These are nice, aren't they?
[00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:11.320]   They're not my glass.
[00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:12.160]   Yeah.
[00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:12.520]   Let me see.
[00:46:12.520 --> 00:46:13.160]   These are thin.
[00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:13.760]   Oh, right.
[00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:14.360]   You got your--
[00:46:14.360 --> 00:46:15.320]   Oh, these do look good.
[00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:16.320]   They're titanium.
[00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:17.320]   They're plastic.
[00:46:17.320 --> 00:46:18.000]   Titanium.
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:18.480]   Titanium.
[00:46:18.480 --> 00:46:18.840]   They look good.
[00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:20.320]   That's plastic from Google.
[00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:22.320]   It's good, except if you get this black thing over here,
[00:46:22.320 --> 00:46:23.000]   right temple.
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:23.680]   I don't want to say that.
[00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:24.680]   Yeah, see it.
[00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:28.600]   Maybe if we're orange, I'd like it better.
[00:46:28.600 --> 00:46:30.760]   I don't think my head is too big.
[00:46:30.760 --> 00:46:34.360]   All right, so I'm going to choose bold, because again,
[00:46:34.360 --> 00:46:37.160]   you're wearing glass while I try to hide it.
[00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:38.520]   Add to cart.
[00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:40.120]   Add accessories or check out.
[00:46:40.120 --> 00:46:40.840]   Should we dare them?
[00:46:40.840 --> 00:46:41.400]   Should we dare them?
[00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:42.040]   No, I'm not about it.
[00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:43.000]   But I'm just--
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:44.120]   It looks like I can just walk.
[00:46:44.120 --> 00:46:44.640]   Come on, Leo.
[00:46:44.640 --> 00:46:45.160]   Come on.
[00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:46.000]   I can walk right through this.
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:47.240]   Here's my cart.
[00:46:47.240 --> 00:46:47.760]   Let's see.
[00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:50.280]   Subtotal $1,500.
[00:46:50.280 --> 00:46:54.960]   I agree to glass terms of sale without reading.
[00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:56.960]   And that's with tax.
[00:46:56.960 --> 00:46:58.080]   Oh, no.
[00:46:58.080 --> 00:47:00.200]   Shipping's already included.
[00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:01.200]   Buy with Google.
[00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:01.600]   Wait, wait, wait.
[00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:02.440]   You just clicked?
[00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:04.000]   No, no, but that's not a buy yet.
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:04.440]   Oh, yeah.
[00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:05.760]   Just prompts you with the wallet.
[00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:06.880]   I have to give it the address.
[00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:07.480]   You're on a touchscreen.
[00:47:07.480 --> 00:47:08.080]   I'd reach over it.
[00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:10.920]   Because now it's going to say--
[00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:12.280]   still doesn't say what-- oh, there's the tax.
[00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:12.960]   $125.
[00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:14.440]   All right, so $16.25.
[00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:17.880]   That's ridiculous.
[00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:20.400]   Just saying.
[00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:23.120]   Can I wear my 2.0 or not?
[00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:23.920]   Oh, yeah, you should.
[00:47:23.920 --> 00:47:26.640]   You'll be at home with all the other geeks.
[00:47:26.640 --> 00:47:29.120]   I'll go into the menswear of the scarce goble.
[00:47:29.120 --> 00:47:31.800]   I just can't ever bring myself to wear glass to Google events.
[00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:33.880]   I went to an event here in New York a couple months ago,
[00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:35.960]   and there were a few people in the audience at glass.
[00:47:35.960 --> 00:47:36.880]   I couldn't do it.
[00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:37.640]   I couldn't do it.
[00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:38.360]   I don't know why.
[00:47:38.360 --> 00:47:41.280]   This is the one place in the earth, Gina, where you put in.
[00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:41.960]   I know.
[00:47:41.960 --> 00:47:43.120]   I know.
[00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:44.600]   I could cook a new--
[00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:47.080]   You notice how quickly I clicked those terms of service.
[00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:48.520]   And in fact, that's what everybody will do.
[00:47:48.520 --> 00:47:50.840]   But it probably would behoove you to wear them.
[00:47:50.840 --> 00:47:53.640]   I would bet-- they say this is beta.
[00:47:53.640 --> 00:47:56.120]   There is no-- if it breaks, are they responsible?
[00:47:56.120 --> 00:47:58.000]   There's no responsibility, right?
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:01.480]   I'm sure those terms of service says you're buying as is
[00:48:01.480 --> 00:48:03.040]   without warranty.
[00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:06.440]   We don't warrant it for any usable purpose.
[00:48:06.440 --> 00:48:08.080]   Yeah, they probably do say that.
[00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:10.120]   My experience has been that they're pretty good,
[00:48:10.120 --> 00:48:10.760]   pretty responsive.
[00:48:10.760 --> 00:48:12.840]   I don't know if you've had the same experience, Jeff.
[00:48:12.840 --> 00:48:14.840]   They called to see how I was doing.
[00:48:14.840 --> 00:48:16.560]   There's a community.
[00:48:16.560 --> 00:48:19.000]   They seem pretty good about--
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:21.280]   It returns exchanges.
[00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:23.440]   It'll accept returns within 30 years.
[00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:24.360]   30 days.
[00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:25.360]   30 days.
[00:48:25.360 --> 00:48:26.520]   Yeah, I wish they were here.
[00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:28.520]   This is going back one year.
[00:48:28.520 --> 00:48:29.640]   They didn't receive.
[00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:30.600]   Oh, that's not bad.
[00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:31.880]   The facts of a girls' workmanship.
[00:48:31.880 --> 00:48:32.680]   Wait, oh.
[00:48:32.680 --> 00:48:33.680]   Under-- under eye levels.
[00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:35.160]   Under ordinary consumer use.
[00:48:35.160 --> 00:48:38.800]   Like, there is an ordinary consumer use for this.
[00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:40.960]   OK, so they'll replace it if it breaks in the first year.
[00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:43.680]   Can I just-- when can-- and I can send it back for how long?
[00:48:43.680 --> 00:48:44.320]   To it.
[00:48:44.320 --> 00:48:46.960]   So I have 30 days to decide not to buy it.
[00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:49.520]   30 days, I think, just for you at home,
[00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:51.640]   would be more than enough to get a sense of what it does,
[00:48:51.640 --> 00:48:53.440]   how you can use it, blah, blah, blah.
[00:48:53.440 --> 00:48:55.840]   And on day 29, send it back.
[00:48:55.840 --> 00:48:57.560]   If you're curious, I think that's a good idea.
[00:48:57.560 --> 00:48:58.640]   I almost did that.
[00:48:58.640 --> 00:48:59.640]   Yeah?
[00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:01.000]   It was a colleague of mine at CUNY.
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:02.360]   He said, no, no, no, a whole lot of them.
[00:49:02.360 --> 00:49:03.960]   Oh, it's going to be valuable.
[00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:07.280]   You know, it will be a bit of history.
[00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:08.440]   You know, I mean, if you--
[00:49:08.440 --> 00:49:12.760]   I still do have my-- what are you--
[00:49:12.760 --> 00:49:13.720]   Newton.
[00:49:13.720 --> 00:49:14.440]   Yeah, I have to--
[00:49:14.440 --> 00:49:15.560]   This is the wearable Newton.
[00:49:15.560 --> 00:49:16.400]   Yeah.
[00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:18.000]   Yes, kind of Newton-E, isn't it?
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:19.320]   Yeah.
[00:49:19.320 --> 00:49:19.800]   I don't know.
[00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:20.560]   And we've launched.
[00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:22.160]   I remembered CNN did a whole thing.
[00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:24.280]   They were in the offices when they pressed Enter
[00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:26.120]   and launched it, Google's re-inventing email.
[00:49:26.120 --> 00:49:28.280]   And you could tell that they were just sort of documenting it
[00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:29.360]   because they thought it was going to be
[00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:30.280]   a big moment in technology.
[00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:33.080]   And that's not going to be in the Computer History Museum.
[00:49:33.080 --> 00:49:37.040]   Did you see this guy typing on his Google Glass?
[00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:43.240]   This is from Minium, which is the world's smallest keyboard.
[00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:44.320]   Is this a joke?
[00:49:44.320 --> 00:49:45.120]   No, no.
[00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:46.120]   Minium is an actual app.
[00:49:46.120 --> 00:49:48.120]   It's a virtual app.
[00:49:48.120 --> 00:49:50.480]   And it is-- it's a different way to type.
[00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:52.400]   So he's sliding in the longest--
[00:49:52.400 --> 00:49:53.920]   He's sliding in the longest temple, yes.
[00:49:53.920 --> 00:49:56.320]   He's going to fall off the mountain while he's typing.
[00:49:56.320 --> 00:49:58.480]   I think it's crazy.
[00:49:58.480 --> 00:50:01.160]   But I think it's interesting.
[00:50:01.160 --> 00:50:02.400]   I mean--
[00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:04.120]   You can dictate, right?
[00:50:04.120 --> 00:50:05.520]   Yeah, you-- well, this is the thing, right?
[00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:07.000]   You want to use voice input.
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:08.000]   I mean, typing on your--
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:09.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:10.000]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:11.760]   Oh, you're an idiot.
[00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:12.760]   Oh, my god.
[00:50:12.760 --> 00:50:15.320]   That's actually Morris code.
[00:50:15.320 --> 00:50:18.120]   Look at the last five seconds of this video.
[00:50:18.120 --> 00:50:21.160]   I just-- I just-- I just-- Yeah, it's right after this.
[00:50:21.160 --> 00:50:23.560]   That?
[00:50:23.560 --> 00:50:24.800]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:50:24.800 --> 00:50:25.200]   Look at that.
[00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:26.200]   Oh, wow.
[00:50:26.200 --> 00:50:27.360]   Oh, so these are these-- OK.
[00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:27.880]   OK.
[00:50:27.880 --> 00:50:30.280]   Are these prototypes?
[00:50:30.280 --> 00:50:31.680]   Or are they selling this?
[00:50:31.680 --> 00:50:32.200]   They seem to have--
[00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:34.560]   So he's typing on his arm.
[00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:36.360]   Yeah, the typing on his arm.
[00:50:36.360 --> 00:50:38.040]   It seemed to be a hint toward--
[00:50:38.040 --> 00:50:42.280]   I don't believe that you can do that yet.
[00:50:42.280 --> 00:50:43.640]   Well, that's very interesting.
[00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:44.480]   Kind of interesting.
[00:50:44.480 --> 00:50:48.000]   And then he was typing in the air, too.
[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:50.280]   Just, I guess, you see a keyboard.
[00:50:50.280 --> 00:50:52.800]   But see, it's not a heads up display, so.
[00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:53.560]   And what is he wearing?
[00:50:53.560 --> 00:50:57.040]   Is that ring on his finger part of the sensor?
[00:50:57.040 --> 00:51:00.160]   It must be-- oh, yeah, that must be that ring, that gesture ring.
[00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:01.200]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:02.240]   You're absolutely right, Leo.
[00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:03.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:04.520]   The index finger ring is not good.
[00:51:04.520 --> 00:51:06.000]   That's totally--
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:07.960]   It looks like a donut, like a bad outback.
[00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:09.000]   It's a donut.
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:10.560]   It's a donut.
[00:51:10.560 --> 00:51:11.760]   I think it's interesting to experiment
[00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:13.800]   with different input types, especially if you think
[00:51:13.800 --> 00:51:17.120]   about this with a watch or other kinds of wearables.
[00:51:17.120 --> 00:51:19.480]   I mean, I would speak what I wanted to say.
[00:51:19.480 --> 00:51:21.200]   But if you're in a place where you can't speak,
[00:51:21.200 --> 00:51:22.080]   you need a quick piece.
[00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:24.640]   I've always wanted to figure out one handed typing thing
[00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:26.960]   that somehow you can get every letter in some way.
[00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:31.520]   That doesn't look at all strings.
[00:51:31.520 --> 00:51:35.560]   Oh, you mean one of those courting keyboards?
[00:51:35.560 --> 00:51:36.000]   The bat?
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:36.600]   Like the bat?
[00:51:36.600 --> 00:51:38.880]   Yeah, I mean, just one hand.
[00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:40.760]   It would be useful.
[00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:45.560]   Well, you know, I mean, it was cool, like the guy, the MIT
[00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:48.000]   wearable computer guy, when you were the only one,
[00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:49.760]   and you had a lot of gear, and that looked right.
[00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:52.160]   Wow, you're really inventing something.
[00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:55.040]   But now it's just product, and that's kind of--
[00:51:55.040 --> 00:51:56.760]   I think it's less cool.
[00:51:56.760 --> 00:51:57.600]   Even less cool.
[00:51:57.600 --> 00:51:58.320]   Even less cool.
[00:51:58.320 --> 00:52:01.000]   The more people--
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:05.120]   I can't think you seriously.
[00:52:05.120 --> 00:52:06.480]   Like you ever do.
[00:52:06.480 --> 00:52:08.680]   I do, but not now.
[00:52:08.680 --> 00:52:14.440]   The more people look like that, even less cool.
[00:52:14.440 --> 00:52:16.040]   Even less cool.
[00:52:16.040 --> 00:52:18.080]   I don't know.
[00:52:18.080 --> 00:52:20.360]   And somebody in the chatroom pointed out, this is true,
[00:52:20.360 --> 00:52:22.480]   do not wear your typing ring on the middle finger,
[00:52:22.480 --> 00:52:26.280]   because you can really get hurt.
[00:52:26.280 --> 00:52:37.200]   Hey, we were talking about the Chrome extension.
[00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:38.920]   And you were saying chat on Windows,
[00:52:38.920 --> 00:52:40.520]   you're able to make that--
[00:52:40.520 --> 00:52:42.960]   I mean, not the Hangouts extension.
[00:52:42.960 --> 00:52:45.200]   You're able to make that an app.
[00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:46.720]   Yeah.
[00:52:46.720 --> 00:52:50.680]   Can't do it on the Mac unless you're using Chrome Canary.
[00:52:50.680 --> 00:52:56.600]   They are now tying those together.
[00:52:56.600 --> 00:52:59.480]   So this is a little different.
[00:52:59.480 --> 00:53:01.680]   This is tying-- so you open a document,
[00:53:01.680 --> 00:53:06.160]   and it will open a Google Chrome app in the browser, right?
[00:53:06.160 --> 00:53:06.660]   Right.
[00:53:06.660 --> 00:53:08.480]   I mean, which is basically just--
[00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:12.600]   so if I have readme.text associated
[00:53:12.600 --> 00:53:16.680]   with a text editor that is a Chrome extension, in the past,
[00:53:16.680 --> 00:53:19.720]   there was no way to say, type double click on readme and have--
[00:53:19.720 --> 00:53:22.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:53:22.520 --> 00:53:23.600]   Is that in Twitter?
[00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:24.200]   It's in the chatroom.
[00:53:24.200 --> 00:53:26.160]   It's in the chatroom.
[00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:28.160]   So that's kind of interesting.
[00:53:28.160 --> 00:53:29.880]   Ben did this.
[00:53:29.880 --> 00:53:32.600]   I think Ben did a little illustration
[00:53:32.600 --> 00:53:35.600]   of what this show is reminding him of.
[00:53:35.600 --> 00:53:39.040]   Ben, can you put Glass on the old man on the left?
[00:53:39.040 --> 00:53:45.280]   Unfortunately, that really looks at that.
[00:53:45.280 --> 00:53:47.320]   Statler and Waldorf from the Muppish show.
[00:53:47.320 --> 00:53:49.080]   Whoa, whoa, one second.
[00:53:49.080 --> 00:53:51.200]   Their heads.
[00:53:51.200 --> 00:53:53.400]   It's exactly right.
[00:53:53.400 --> 00:53:55.400]   It's exactly right.
[00:53:55.400 --> 00:53:57.040]   And then Gina, why doesn't Gina get-- why
[00:53:57.040 --> 00:53:58.720]   can't she get Miss Biggie or something?
[00:53:58.720 --> 00:54:00.160]   Come on.
[00:54:00.160 --> 00:54:02.680]   I guess you like Gina.
[00:54:02.680 --> 00:54:03.400]   Hi, Fabi.
[00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:04.600]   You're being Miss Biggie.
[00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:08.360]   OK, can you talk in faux French?
[00:54:08.360 --> 00:54:13.600]   This is actually a bit of a hack to get the Mac to do this.
[00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:15.520]   But to enable it, you have to be, first of all,
[00:54:15.520 --> 00:54:19.280]   using Google Chrome Canary, which is their gamma version,
[00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:20.880]   not even beta, but gamma.
[00:54:20.880 --> 00:54:23.000]   And then you have to use the Chrome flag,
[00:54:23.000 --> 00:54:26.120]   enable apps file associations.
[00:54:26.120 --> 00:54:28.440]   And that's kind of cool.
[00:54:28.440 --> 00:54:29.320]   It's kind of cool.
[00:54:29.320 --> 00:54:32.640]   They actually say it's easier to do on a Mac
[00:54:32.640 --> 00:54:34.240]   because of the way the Mac works.
[00:54:34.240 --> 00:54:40.760]   So I think we should start doing more--
[00:54:40.760 --> 00:54:44.840]   clearly, we need to do more Chrome extensions.
[00:54:44.840 --> 00:54:47.080]   Like your App Arena on all about Android,
[00:54:47.080 --> 00:54:48.480]   we should do Chrome extension arena.
[00:54:48.480 --> 00:54:49.400]   Oh, yeah, interesting.
[00:54:49.400 --> 00:54:49.920]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:54:49.920 --> 00:54:54.040]   Clearly, that's more and more becoming a thing.
[00:54:54.040 --> 00:54:56.200]   You never see it all about Chrome show.
[00:54:56.200 --> 00:54:57.200]   No.
[00:54:57.200 --> 00:54:57.480]   No.
[00:54:57.480 --> 00:54:59.160]   That would be great.
[00:54:59.160 --> 00:54:59.560]   No.
[00:54:59.560 --> 00:55:01.520]   All about it, and you're going to explore.
[00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:04.120]   Oh, I'm out of fire, funk.
[00:55:04.120 --> 00:55:07.440]   Did you note the 20-year anniversary of IE?
[00:55:07.440 --> 00:55:07.960]   No.
[00:55:07.960 --> 00:55:08.440]   No.
[00:55:08.440 --> 00:55:13.440]   Of the reunion party for--
[00:55:13.440 --> 00:55:14.240]   Let's keep.
[00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:14.920]   Last week.
[00:55:14.920 --> 00:55:15.920]   Oh, yes, I did.
[00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:20.600]   I saw a very interesting picture of Jim Barksdale.
[00:55:20.600 --> 00:55:25.440]   And yeah, I mean, these guys 20 years ago, was it the stock,
[00:55:25.440 --> 00:55:26.240]   the IPO?
[00:55:26.240 --> 00:55:30.520]   No, because the browser was released in October '94.
[00:55:30.520 --> 00:55:31.040]   OK.
[00:55:31.040 --> 00:55:32.800]   So it was the browser release.
[00:55:32.800 --> 00:55:33.800]   No, it was October.
[00:55:33.800 --> 00:55:34.800]   It was before October.
[00:55:34.800 --> 00:55:35.960]   So it must be the company was formed.
[00:55:35.960 --> 00:55:38.000]   Company was formed, all right.
[00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:39.800]   Very cool.
[00:55:39.800 --> 00:55:43.040]   A Chrome show, though, would be Chromecast, Chrome OS.
[00:55:43.040 --> 00:55:45.160]   Yeah, you know what, actually, we could do a Chrome show.
[00:55:45.160 --> 00:55:45.680]   Yeah.
[00:55:45.680 --> 00:55:46.520]   I mean, you know.
[00:55:46.520 --> 00:55:48.320]   There is something there.
[00:55:48.320 --> 00:55:48.960]   Meanwhile--
[00:55:48.960 --> 00:55:50.160]   You'd be a little weird to have a Chrome show.
[00:55:50.160 --> 00:55:51.680]   --the burn is on this show to do.
[00:55:51.680 --> 00:55:53.800]   Yes, we'll cover Chrome stuff.
[00:55:53.800 --> 00:55:55.120]   It's our turf, Gina.
[00:55:55.120 --> 00:55:55.640]   It's ours.
[00:55:55.640 --> 00:55:56.400]   It's true.
[00:55:56.400 --> 00:55:56.920]   It's true.
[00:55:56.920 --> 00:55:58.080]   Yeah, don't give it away to some--
[00:55:58.080 --> 00:55:59.240]   Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:55:59.240 --> 00:56:00.800]   Young person.
[00:56:00.800 --> 00:56:02.800]   Let us hold farts to it.
[00:56:02.800 --> 00:56:04.240]   We can leave Android all about it.
[00:56:04.240 --> 00:56:05.240]   The AA, but--
[00:56:05.240 --> 00:56:07.160]   Yeah, Android's for all about Android.
[00:56:07.160 --> 00:56:09.640]   You're the host of that, but long with Jason.
[00:56:09.640 --> 00:56:10.760]   That's fine.
[00:56:10.760 --> 00:56:13.680]   But we want to keep Chrome extensions.
[00:56:13.680 --> 00:56:15.640]   Last month, Governor Cuomo in New York
[00:56:15.640 --> 00:56:19.760]   announced-- or appointed a three-person commission
[00:56:19.760 --> 00:56:23.760]   to advise on the use of technology in schools.
[00:56:23.760 --> 00:56:26.120]   One of the three, Eric Schmidt, seems like somebody
[00:56:26.120 --> 00:56:28.600]   would know a little bit about technology in schools.
[00:56:28.600 --> 00:56:31.960]   He is still the chairman of the board at Google.
[00:56:31.960 --> 00:56:34.160]   Apparently, there are consumer watchdog,
[00:56:34.160 --> 00:56:36.400]   and others are not happy.
[00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:38.480]   Consumer watchdog being an organization that
[00:56:38.480 --> 00:56:39.880]   goes after Google all the time.
[00:56:39.880 --> 00:56:42.960]   That's their job, not to be happy.
[00:56:42.960 --> 00:56:44.760]   They filed a complaint with the New York State Joint
[00:56:44.760 --> 00:56:47.320]   Commission on Public Ethics, saying Schmidt has, quote,
[00:56:47.320 --> 00:56:51.120]   "serious, troubling, and unlawful conflicts of interest."
[00:56:51.120 --> 00:56:51.960]   It is a good point.
[00:56:51.960 --> 00:56:53.440]   I mean, I figure Eric's going to go in there
[00:56:53.440 --> 00:56:55.720]   and say use Chromebooks.
[00:56:55.720 --> 00:56:56.400]   Yeah.
[00:56:56.400 --> 00:56:59.120]   But I think he might also have the good sense to recuse himself
[00:56:59.120 --> 00:57:00.000]   in that discussion.
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:00.760]   And talk about a host.
[00:57:00.760 --> 00:57:01.440]   What do you do?
[00:57:01.440 --> 00:57:04.240]   You have no-- you never get any advice from anyone
[00:57:04.240 --> 00:57:05.240]   in industry?
[00:57:05.240 --> 00:57:05.680]   Right.
[00:57:05.680 --> 00:57:06.440]   Don't you?
[00:57:06.440 --> 00:57:07.440]   What do you want to do?
[00:57:07.440 --> 00:57:08.640]   What's the way for an oil company there?
[00:57:08.640 --> 00:57:09.800]   Well, the super watchdog said it's
[00:57:09.800 --> 00:57:13.440]   because Eric's the only person with a seat at the table.
[00:57:13.440 --> 00:57:16.400]   He says, if it were one of several technology representatives,
[00:57:16.400 --> 00:57:17.280]   it would be more accessible.
[00:57:17.280 --> 00:57:17.880]   That's the one.
[00:57:17.880 --> 00:57:18.720]   I'll buy that much.
[00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:22.680]   Get Bill Gates, Eric Schmidt, and Tim Cook on that board.
[00:57:22.680 --> 00:57:25.080]   Now you got some.
[00:57:25.080 --> 00:57:27.520]   Yeah, I thought that that was a good point.
[00:57:27.520 --> 00:57:29.160]   And honestly, I'd rather see somebody who
[00:57:29.160 --> 00:57:31.200]   is an advocate for the students, primarily, who's
[00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:33.480]   very tech savvy versus someone like me.
[00:57:33.480 --> 00:57:36.280]   Yeah, how savvy is Eric Schmidt?
[00:57:36.280 --> 00:57:40.320]   Hey, kids, if you want to buy pants,
[00:57:40.320 --> 00:57:43.800]   we've got a solution for you.
[00:57:43.800 --> 00:57:46.040]   Or I'd like to see someone like you, Leo, who--
[00:57:46.040 --> 00:57:47.040]   Well, I do that, actually.
[00:57:47.040 --> 00:57:47.680]   --of the sports on comitates.
[00:57:47.680 --> 00:57:48.180]   Yeah.
[00:57:48.180 --> 00:57:51.200]   I serve on a nonprofit board advising and on technology.
[00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:51.880]   That's great.
[00:57:51.880 --> 00:57:53.040]   And I did do that for some city--
[00:57:53.040 --> 00:57:54.680]   Is this all the micro books?
[00:57:54.680 --> 00:57:59.320]   I did, and they bought Lenovo Windows Notebooks instead.
[00:57:59.320 --> 00:57:59.840]   That's OK.
[00:57:59.840 --> 00:58:00.520]   You know why they did it?
[00:58:00.520 --> 00:58:02.200]   Because they used to do-- it's a one-to-one program
[00:58:02.200 --> 00:58:04.320]   in the school, and they used to use Macintashes.
[00:58:04.320 --> 00:58:06.200]   But Apple's price just got out of reach.
[00:58:06.200 --> 00:58:06.680]   Really?
[00:58:06.680 --> 00:58:08.840]   Yeah, and so they had to go Windows.
[00:58:08.840 --> 00:58:11.160]   I think they use Google--
[00:58:11.160 --> 00:58:13.280]   all Google services, Google Docs, and everything.
[00:58:13.280 --> 00:58:14.480]   I think it's just a matter of time
[00:58:14.480 --> 00:58:15.280]   before they go to Chromebooks.
[00:58:20.120 --> 00:58:24.800]   If you were to run your own mail server,
[00:58:24.800 --> 00:58:27.280]   because you're very privacy conscious,
[00:58:27.280 --> 00:58:29.840]   and you didn't want Google to get information
[00:58:29.840 --> 00:58:34.560]   about your emails, how much of your mail
[00:58:34.560 --> 00:58:35.920]   would not be visible to Google?
[00:58:35.920 --> 00:58:37.280]   Turns out, not much.
[00:58:37.280 --> 00:58:41.960]   Only about half Benjamin Mako Hill, who
[00:58:41.960 --> 00:58:46.520]   has the copyrightous blog, says, doesn't even
[00:58:46.520 --> 00:58:49.440]   matter if I don't want Google to have information about me,
[00:58:49.440 --> 00:58:52.040]   because you are probably using Gmail.
[00:58:52.040 --> 00:58:53.880]   About half of my correspondence used Gmail.
[00:58:53.880 --> 00:58:54.480]   I used Gmail.
[00:58:54.480 --> 00:58:56.760]   Anybody sends anything to me whether they use Gmail or not
[00:58:56.760 --> 00:58:59.840]   is exposed to Google.
[00:58:59.840 --> 00:59:00.840]   Is it possible if that is?
[00:59:00.840 --> 00:59:04.720]   If all your friends use Gmail, Google has your mail anyway.
[00:59:04.720 --> 00:59:07.000]   So he wrote a little program to go through all the email
[00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:09.720]   he's kept in his personal inbox since April 2004.
[00:59:09.720 --> 00:59:15.840]   That's when Gmail first came out to see if they had a Gmail
[00:59:15.840 --> 00:59:19.560]   address or not, to see how many emails Google would have.
[00:59:19.560 --> 00:59:23.720]   And he says about a third of the email in my inbox comes from
[00:59:23.720 --> 00:59:24.000]   Google.
[00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:26.560]   I think he's lower than most of us.
[00:59:26.560 --> 00:59:28.200]   But I'm going to do an analysis.
[00:59:28.200 --> 00:59:31.400]   I might get a lot of email from AOL.com users.
[00:59:31.400 --> 00:59:33.720]   Because you got old farts?
[00:59:33.720 --> 00:59:34.720]   Old farts are friends.
[00:59:34.720 --> 00:59:38.400]   On the tech I show you mentioned Windows XP.
[00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:39.680]   Where can I get that?
[00:59:43.520 --> 00:59:48.000]   It also says that the proportion of my personal email that
[00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:50.920]   comes by Google is probably much higher.
[00:59:50.920 --> 00:59:51.720]   Yeah.
[00:59:51.720 --> 00:59:53.920]   That makes sense for a reason.
[00:59:53.920 --> 00:59:56.040]   Despite the fact I spent hundreds of dollars a year and
[00:59:56.040 --> 00:59:59.080]   hours of work to host my own email server, Google has about
[00:59:59.080 --> 01:00:01.000]   half of my personal email.
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:02.800]   It's probably even higher than they know, because if you
[01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:04.960]   send email to Buzz Machine, you don't know that it's an
[01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:06.120]   apps account.
[01:00:06.120 --> 01:00:07.360]   That's right.
[01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:09.480]   Twit.tv is an apps account.
[01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:11.280]   You send an email to lira.tv.
[01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:12.720]   It's going through Google.
[01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:13.440]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:14.560]   And that's what he's saying, right?
[01:00:14.560 --> 01:00:18.000]   That a lot of it goes through their S&P servers or whatever.
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.240]   They're forwarding addresses.
[01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:21.560]   So just give up.
[01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:22.720]   Just give up.
[01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:25.040]   As one of the people in the chatroom says, well, you just
[01:00:25.040 --> 01:00:27.000]   had a minute ago that if you don't like Google, just don't
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:28.840]   use it, now you're still trapped anyway.
[01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:30.920]   Well, don't use email.
[01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:34.680]   Or only use 43% of your email.
[01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:36.240]   I mean, this is a little bit akin to saying, all my
[01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:38.440]   personal-- all these people have my personal letters,
[01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:39.800]   because I sent them to them.
[01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:43.360]   No, that's the nature of it, right?
[01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:46.600]   But if it makes sense to need a campaign not to use Gmail,
[01:00:46.600 --> 01:00:48.040]   that would be your--
[01:00:48.040 --> 01:00:50.360]   OK, but this is a knowledge store for discussion today.
[01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:51.240]   It's exactly that.
[01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:53.680]   So you sent me a letter, and then you come along five years
[01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:56.520]   later and say, I demand you destroy that letter I sent you.
[01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:57.480]   Yeah.
[01:00:57.480 --> 01:00:57.840]   Too late.
[01:00:57.840 --> 01:00:59.480]   I have a right to be forgotten.
[01:00:59.480 --> 01:01:01.400]   Yeah.
[01:01:01.400 --> 01:01:01.880]   Sorry.
[01:01:01.880 --> 01:01:02.360]   I'm not sure.
[01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:03.280]   Yeah.
[01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:03.920]   Yeah.
[01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:06.600]   Now, the difference between someone who has a Gmail account
[01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:09.560]   and a Google account and has all their email stored on Google
[01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:11.720]   and uses their services all the time is that Google is
[01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:14.200]   actively advertising to that person.
[01:01:14.200 --> 01:01:16.680]   Whereas someone who hosts their own email account, even though
[01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:19.680]   Google has a storing email that they've sent to people who
[01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:24.960]   use Google, from what I understand, Google isn't building
[01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:29.880]   a profile or keeping a store of data about that person to try
[01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:32.080]   to advertise to them, because they're not signed into a Google
[01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:35.240]   account when they send that email.
[01:01:35.240 --> 01:01:38.720]   So for the folks who do want to opt out of Google's advertising
[01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:41.720]   on whatever level, I think it is still worth setting up
[01:01:41.720 --> 01:01:43.120]   your own email server.
[01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:46.080]   And I actually have quite a few friends who do that.
[01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:47.720]   I'm too lazy, but--
[01:01:47.720 --> 01:01:49.880]   Well, it's a good thing you don't live in the People's
[01:01:49.880 --> 01:01:53.600]   Republic of New Zealand.
[01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:56.840]   Apparently, New Zealand is now going to require network
[01:01:56.840 --> 01:02:01.000]   operators, internet service providers, to register with police.
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.800]   Their staff must have security clearance.
[01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:07.080]   And when they change networks by gear,
[01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:10.840]   they actually have to get approval from the New Zealand spy
[01:02:10.840 --> 01:02:11.560]   agency.
[01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:14.240]   Who spies on New Zealand?
[01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:18.760]   What's just the government communications security bureau?
[01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:21.600]   Kiwi pricing?
[01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:23.160]   Ah, that's interesting.
[01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:25.280]   I don't know.
[01:02:25.280 --> 01:02:27.440]   I always thought of New Zealand as kind of a little bit
[01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:28.200]   like hippies.
[01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:28.680]   Yeah.
[01:02:28.680 --> 01:02:29.440]   And apparently not.
[01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:35.080]   New Zealand, if you're an internet service provider,
[01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:38.960]   you're going to have to register with the police.
[01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:45.360]   Did you read Liz Gaines' article about how boring it was
[01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:49.320]   to take a ride in the Google Autonomous Vehicle?
[01:02:49.320 --> 01:02:50.400]   I guess that's a good thing.
[01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:54.240]   Although people, the headline from a lot of people
[01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:55.040]   was it was mundane.
[01:02:55.040 --> 01:02:56.840]   It was boring.
[01:02:56.840 --> 01:02:57.440]   I don't know.
[01:02:57.440 --> 01:03:00.720]   She says the car braked for jaywalkers,
[01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:02.320]   paused when it was coming around a curve
[01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:04.440]   and couldn't see whether the light in front of us
[01:03:04.440 --> 01:03:07.880]   was green or red and skiddered when it worried a bus might
[01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:10.120]   be turning into our lane.
[01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:11.120]   That doesn't sound mundane.
[01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:12.520]   This sounds a little nerve wracking.
[01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:13.840]   It does sound terrible.
[01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:14.840]   Yeah.
[01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:18.080]   Well, did you see Silicon Valley this week?
[01:03:18.080 --> 01:03:18.480]   No, no.
[01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:19.480]   Yeah.
[01:03:19.480 --> 01:03:24.000]   So one of the characters gets into an autonomous vehicle.
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.840]   And it says, oh, where would you like to go?
[01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:28.000]   And he says, I would--
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:28.880]   you know, and gives the address.
[01:03:28.880 --> 01:03:30.000]   I'd like to go home.
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:31.160]   And about halfway through the trip,
[01:03:31.160 --> 01:03:33.560]   the autonomous vehicle says rerouting.
[01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:36.120]   And all of a sudden, it's on its way to an island, a man-made
[01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:38.400]   island in the middle of the ocean.
[01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:39.720]   And the guy's in the backseat.
[01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:41.240]   He says, what?
[01:03:41.240 --> 01:03:41.880]   Hello?
[01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:43.320]   Hello, car?
[01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:46.240]   The car just keeps-- it makes a big U-turn keeps going.
[01:03:46.240 --> 01:03:49.320]   Drives into a container on a ship.
[01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:50.480]   The guy's going, let me out.
[01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:50.920]   Let me out.
[01:03:50.920 --> 01:03:52.080]   They seal the container.
[01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:52.920]   The ship sails.
[01:03:52.920 --> 01:03:55.200]   He's off in the island in the middle of the ocean.
[01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:56.960]   Finally, he gets there.
[01:03:56.960 --> 01:03:57.920]   The container is open.
[01:03:57.920 --> 01:03:59.160]   He thinks, finally, humans.
[01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:00.400]   Turns out the whole island in the ocean
[01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:03.400]   is manned by more robots.
[01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:06.760]   We don't know what's going to happen in this character.
[01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:08.920]   Now, that's a self-driving vehicle.
[01:04:08.920 --> 01:04:11.160]   Is the self-driving stripped?
[01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:13.280]   I think it's pretty funny.
[01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:14.080]   It was well done.
[01:04:14.080 --> 01:04:18.960]   It was a B plot, subplot, stretched throughout the show.
[01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:20.400]   See, everyone's in a while, they check back.
[01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:21.200]   Where is he now?
[01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:25.840]   So anyway, good for Liz.
[01:04:25.840 --> 01:04:29.080]   I don't know how she got a ride in the self-driving car.
[01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:30.360]   That's kind of cool.
[01:04:30.360 --> 01:04:31.640]   Wonder why-- if we could get a ride--
[01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:32.440]   Are you driven to?
[01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:34.760]   No, I haven't when I was going to visit Google campus.
[01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:36.520]   And somebody said, oh, we get you a ride in the car.
[01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:37.520]   And I have to do it that day.
[01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:38.680]   So I think they do it for you.
[01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:39.680]   I'd love to do that.
[01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:40.180]   Yeah?
[01:04:40.180 --> 01:04:41.960]   We should see if we can arrange the whole twig crew
[01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:45.120]   go for a ride or an I/O. That'd be pretty awesome.
[01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:46.000]   That would.
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:46.560]   She says my--
[01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:48.280]   She's a true show from the self-driving car.
[01:04:48.280 --> 01:04:49.360]   Oh, that'd be great.
[01:04:49.360 --> 01:04:51.880]   Now, I presume there's a guy sitting in the driver's seat
[01:04:51.880 --> 01:04:54.080]   with his hands poised over the wheel just in case.
[01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:55.600]   That's going to be a nerve-wracking job.
[01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:57.160]   You're always ready.
[01:04:57.160 --> 01:04:58.760]   My distinct impression, Liz writes,
[01:04:58.760 --> 01:05:00.280]   was that the Google self-driving car
[01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:03.920]   is nowhere near ready for commercialization.
[01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:07.080]   She said she felt fairly confident in it.
[01:05:07.080 --> 01:05:07.280]   But--
[01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:08.320]   But there are also stories today
[01:05:08.320 --> 01:05:11.280]   that Google is talking to auto companies actively.
[01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:12.560]   Yeah.
[01:05:12.560 --> 01:05:14.200]   Jeff, so my question for you is--
[01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:16.480]   I know you said you can't stop progress.
[01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:19.480]   But would you trust-- would you take a ride in the self-driving
[01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:21.840]   car across a bridge?
[01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:23.320]   That's my question for you.
[01:05:23.320 --> 01:05:24.000]   Oh, no, I wouldn't.
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:24.640]   I wouldn't do that.
[01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:27.440]   Is the self-driving car suicidal?
[01:05:27.440 --> 01:05:29.000]   I wouldn't do that.
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000]   Apparently, Google employees are now
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:32.880]   commuting to work in self-driving cars.
[01:05:32.880 --> 01:05:33.520]   Really?
[01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:34.920]   But again, there's always a ride--
[01:05:34.920 --> 01:05:38.920]   Until San Franciscans stand up and throw yogurt on them.
[01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:40.960]   The day you can sit in the back seat
[01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:43.680]   when nobody in the front seat, that's a self-driving car.
[01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:45.520]   If you're sitting in the front seat with your hands
[01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:46.960]   poised over the steering wheel--
[01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:47.760]   You're pretty--
[01:05:47.760 --> 01:05:49.520]   In fact, I think that's more tense than just driving this up.
[01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:51.880]   I think it is too.
[01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:53.080]   It's like plus.
[01:05:53.080 --> 01:05:55.240]   What does it take to take it over?
[01:05:55.240 --> 01:05:57.920]   How long has that added response time?
[01:05:57.920 --> 01:05:59.680]   Right.
[01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:01.320]   That's a good question.
[01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:04.520]   Google's self-driving cars still have trouble in rain,
[01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:06.960]   especially on the highway when other cars kick up water.
[01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:09.400]   They're currently about as good as a human driving
[01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:11.000]   in heavy fog.
[01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:12.440]   And they forget snow.
[01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:16.120]   They haven't even tried that.
[01:06:16.120 --> 01:06:17.600]   So California.
[01:06:17.600 --> 01:06:20.440]   Snow, what's that, man?
[01:06:20.440 --> 01:06:22.600]   Women that water is going to freeze?
[01:06:22.600 --> 01:06:23.920]   That'll be version 4.0.
[01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:24.920]   Yeah, it is.
[01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:26.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:30.920]   This is good.
[01:06:30.920 --> 01:06:34.400]   In fact, he says, for all the millions of measurements
[01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:36.800]   and computations per second, you're really only doing two
[01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:39.040]   things.
[01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:41.440]   The throttle and the steering.
[01:06:41.440 --> 01:06:45.320]   How fast you're going and which way you're going?
[01:06:45.320 --> 01:06:47.680]   So this story from Venture Beat says
[01:06:47.680 --> 01:06:50.480]   that Google self-driving car technology may appear in Toyota's
[01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:55.280]   Ford's and other widely available vehicles in about six years.
[01:06:55.280 --> 01:06:58.080]   That's about the cycle for developing a car is fairly long.
[01:06:58.080 --> 01:06:59.640]   It's not that.
[01:06:59.640 --> 01:07:00.840]   It could well be just that.
[01:07:00.840 --> 01:07:08.880]   Well, didn't Twitter have a mute function all along?
[01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:11.160]   I see so much about this mute function.
[01:07:11.160 --> 01:07:13.440]   Not the official apps.
[01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:15.480]   On official apps, third party apps had mute.
[01:07:15.480 --> 01:07:17.360]   What's the new mute and block again?
[01:07:17.360 --> 01:07:19.120]   You explained this before, Gina, but I forget.
[01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:21.040]   Mute is you're following the person,
[01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:24.120]   but you don't see their tweets in your timeline
[01:07:24.120 --> 01:07:25.280]   for however long that person is muted.
[01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:26.440]   You don't unfollow them.
[01:07:26.440 --> 01:07:27.920]   You just shut them up.
[01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:30.400]   Yeah, you just don't see them in your timeline.
[01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:32.160]   And more importantly, the muted user
[01:07:32.160 --> 01:07:34.240]   will not know you've muted them.
[01:07:34.240 --> 01:07:34.560]   Right.
[01:07:34.560 --> 01:07:38.160]   And you appear to be following them in fact.
[01:07:38.160 --> 01:07:40.520]   So it's like the way to unsubscribe for someone
[01:07:40.520 --> 01:07:41.880]   but keep them as your friend.
[01:07:41.880 --> 01:07:43.960]   This is programming on the head of a pin.
[01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:45.600]   And I love 9 to 5 Google, which
[01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:49.040]   used Donald Trump as an example.
[01:07:49.040 --> 01:07:51.920]   I mean, I think the use case is like a Leo is live tweeting
[01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:52.920]   Silicon Valley.
[01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:53.920]   I don't want to watch that.
[01:07:53.920 --> 01:07:54.440]   Right.
[01:07:54.440 --> 01:07:55.760]   So I mute him during the Dury.
[01:07:55.760 --> 01:07:58.200]   Yeah, or you know, when conferences,
[01:07:58.200 --> 01:08:00.280]   everybody's at South by Southwest,
[01:08:00.280 --> 01:08:01.640]   I wish you could mute a hashtag.
[01:08:01.640 --> 01:08:04.240]   Anything with SSSW.
[01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:07.520]   And I want to say now, if I'm at a conference irritating people,
[01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:10.480]   I want to say number one, I'm from New York.
[01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:11.320]   I can irritate you.
[01:08:11.320 --> 01:08:11.640]   Right.
[01:08:11.640 --> 01:08:14.040]   And number two, just mute me.
[01:08:14.040 --> 01:08:15.560]   You'll be.
[01:08:15.560 --> 01:08:17.280]   Feature will roll out to all users
[01:08:17.280 --> 01:08:19.360]   over the next coming weeks.
[01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:21.960]   And finally, Flappy Bird is back.
[01:08:21.960 --> 01:08:24.520]   Thank God.
[01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:26.640]   The world was a much worse place without it.
[01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:27.360]   I did play it.
[01:08:27.360 --> 01:08:28.040]   I still have it.
[01:08:28.040 --> 01:08:28.640]   You want to play it?
[01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:29.200]   Have you ever played it?
[01:08:29.200 --> 01:08:30.360]   No, I hate games.
[01:08:30.360 --> 01:08:31.680]   Well, this game you'd really hate.
[01:08:31.680 --> 01:08:33.520]   Flappy Bird creator, and Ywen Dong,
[01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:36.560]   says, I'm bringing the game back in August.
[01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:38.680]   It will be a multiplayer game.
[01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:40.240]   And he's been spending all this time
[01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:42.240]   making it less addictive.
[01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:48.960]   Oh, this guy feels really bad for him.
[01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:51.600]   I mean, the fact that he's a game maker,
[01:08:51.600 --> 01:08:53.680]   and he's trying to make it less addictive.
[01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:55.680]   It was too successful.
[01:08:55.680 --> 01:08:56.880]   It was too successful.
[01:08:56.880 --> 01:08:59.520]   It was too successful.
[01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:03.920]   And he said, people were wasting too much of their life.
[01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:07.680]   Aw, I feel bad.
[01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:11.200]   Well, we're glad to have Dong back in the Android store.
[01:09:11.200 --> 01:09:12.640]   That's nice to say.
[01:09:12.640 --> 01:09:13.920]   Yeah.
[01:09:13.920 --> 01:09:17.160]   What store doesn't need more Dong?
[01:09:17.160 --> 01:09:18.120]   We're going to take a break.
[01:09:18.120 --> 01:09:19.600]   And when we come back--
[01:09:19.600 --> 01:09:21.080]   Thank you for laughing.
[01:09:21.080 --> 01:09:22.280]   Jeff did not laugh.
[01:09:22.280 --> 01:09:23.040]   I had no idea.
[01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:24.400]   I was neither did you.
[01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:27.480]   Let the world go forth.
[01:09:27.480 --> 01:09:29.680]   This show brought to you by my good buddies
[01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:31.400]   at Personal Capital.
[01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:32.880]   In fact, I was just meeting with them.
[01:09:32.880 --> 01:09:33.640]   I love these guys.
[01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:36.000]   Personal Capital is--
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:37.440]   they said, can we use the word life hacker?
[01:09:37.440 --> 01:09:38.920]   I said, no, I don't think so.
[01:09:38.920 --> 01:09:39.920]   Gina has to.
[01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:41.840]   But it is a life hack.
[01:09:41.840 --> 01:09:44.320]   It is a way to make your life--
[01:09:44.320 --> 01:09:47.360]   guys must have trademarked life hacks.
[01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:48.600]   I think we trademarked life hacker.
[01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:50.160]   I think Gawker trademarked life hacker.
[01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:50.840]   Not hacks?
[01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:51.560]   Not life hack.
[01:09:51.560 --> 01:09:52.480]   No, no, no.
[01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:54.280]   Well, two words, life hack.
[01:09:54.280 --> 01:09:55.280]   So here's the problem.
[01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:58.160]   I mean, if you're a busy person, you've got a family,
[01:09:58.160 --> 01:09:59.280]   you're working.
[01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:01.000]   The last thing you have time to do
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:04.040]   is keep track of your finances, frankly.
[01:10:04.040 --> 01:10:06.400]   And if you're saving for the future,
[01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:08.840]   if you're investing for the future,
[01:10:08.840 --> 01:10:09.840]   the chances are good.
[01:10:09.840 --> 01:10:12.880]   You're either not doing it at all or ignoring it,
[01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:16.680]   or you're getting ignored by some stock broker
[01:10:16.680 --> 01:10:19.400]   in some mahogany walled office.
[01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:22.400]   Or maybe you decided to go the digital route
[01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:28.400]   and use a digital broker, and even more ignoring goes on.
[01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:30.240]   Personal Capital is such a great solution.
[01:10:30.240 --> 01:10:33.920]   First thing you're going to do is visit personalcapital.com/tweak.
[01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:36.640]   It is free to sign up.
[01:10:36.640 --> 01:10:37.840]   And I'll explain how that works.
[01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:40.520]   It's a free and it's secure tool
[01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:43.560]   that will gather all your accounts, everything together.
[01:10:43.560 --> 01:10:46.960]   You're checking your charge cards, your mortgage,
[01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:50.200]   your loans, and your investments.
[01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:52.600]   All in one place, you get a good live dashboard
[01:10:52.600 --> 01:10:55.640]   you can look at on your computer or your mobile device
[01:10:55.640 --> 01:10:58.520]   on a single screen exactly what's going on.
[01:10:58.520 --> 01:11:00.200]   It'll show you, among other things,
[01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:01.640]   how much you're overpaying in fees,
[01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:03.280]   how you can reduce those fees.
[01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:05.640]   And people sometimes ask me, well, if it's free,
[01:11:05.640 --> 01:11:07.240]   how do they make money?
[01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:08.480]   It's kind of freemium.
[01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:11.680]   They will give-- you can get a certified financial planner
[01:11:11.680 --> 01:11:12.720]   to give you advice.
[01:11:12.720 --> 01:11:14.080]   These are not salesmen.
[01:11:14.080 --> 01:11:15.240]   They are not selling you stock.
[01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:16.880]   They do not make commission on stock.
[01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:20.360]   They're giving you independent advice on your investments.
[01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:22.840]   And that is a really great thing.
[01:11:22.840 --> 01:11:24.560]   We know you like to do things faster
[01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:26.080]   and you like to do things easy.
[01:11:26.080 --> 01:11:29.280]   And sometimes some of the most important stuff gets ignored.
[01:11:29.280 --> 01:11:32.920]   This is a way to get it done without consuming your life,
[01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:36.680]   to get an investment, check up a mutual fund fee calculator
[01:11:36.680 --> 01:11:39.920]   to get research and insights.
[01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:43.600]   They'll send you personalized updates every week
[01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:46.800]   with highlights and suggestions to keep your finances
[01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:48.400]   on the right track.
[01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:52.120]   It's really it's OK to save and invest.
[01:11:52.120 --> 01:11:53.920]   It's important to save and invest.
[01:11:53.920 --> 01:11:59.040]   Do it right with a free tool that can give you unbiased financial advice.
[01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:01.800]   Personalcapital.com/twig.
[01:12:01.800 --> 01:12:03.560]   Absolutely free.
[01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:04.920]   And I think you will like it.
[01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:05.720]   Personal Capital.
[01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:08.880]   I've been using it for two years since I met the founder Bill Harris.
[01:12:08.880 --> 01:12:09.840]   He was on triangulation.
[01:12:09.840 --> 01:12:10.760]   And you're rich.
[01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:12.440]   I tell you rich.
[01:12:12.440 --> 01:12:14.400]   Well, I tell you one thing.
[01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:18.040]   I could have been less rich if I had not been used to personal capital.
[01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:20.280]   Especially the last couple of years, it's been a little up and down.
[01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:22.000]   The wrong investments could be a big mistake.
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.440]   And I tell you, sometimes he's stockbroker.
[01:12:24.440 --> 01:12:29.120]   So put you-- say, oh, we've got a mutual fund for you.
[01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:34.640]   Run by our own company with a 5% fee right in the front there.
[01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:38.640]   So let us get our tip and our number and our tool of the week.
[01:12:38.640 --> 01:12:41.400]   We'll start with Gina Trapani.
[01:12:41.400 --> 01:12:45.040]   This is a new Google Now feature that I think is a little weird,
[01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:46.440]   but also kind of interesting.
[01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:51.240]   You can use Google Now to remind yourself to cancel things
[01:12:51.240 --> 01:12:53.680]   like Amazon Prime and Netflix.
[01:12:53.680 --> 01:12:55.160]   I don't know what this is about.
[01:12:55.160 --> 01:12:57.360]   I don't know if Google's trying to get you to cancel Amazon Prime.
[01:12:57.360 --> 01:12:58.280]   But maybe.
[01:12:58.280 --> 01:13:00.560]   Anyway, if you say, remind me to cancel--
[01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:01.800]   Well, I mean, it's for example.
[01:13:01.800 --> 01:13:03.280]   --for Amazon Prime.
[01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:05.800]   That seems anti-competitive on the face of it, but OK.
[01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:06.280]   Yeah.
[01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:10.760]   And now we'll show you a little cancel subscription link that
[01:13:10.760 --> 01:13:12.440]   will take you right to the cancel page.
[01:13:12.440 --> 01:13:12.960]   She is.
[01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:14.280]   Well, now see, that's what's different.
[01:13:14.280 --> 01:13:16.720]   Because you could always say, remind me to X.
[01:13:16.720 --> 01:13:17.220]   Right.
[01:13:17.220 --> 01:13:19.680]   But this actually says, oh, I see the word cancel.
[01:13:19.680 --> 01:13:20.840]   Let's show you how to-- you know what?
[01:13:20.840 --> 01:13:22.280]   This is great because I do that.
[01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:24.880]   I have-- I had a Vonage subscription for four years
[01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:27.160]   that I never used.
[01:13:27.160 --> 01:13:29.040]   And it was on my to-do list.
[01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:31.280]   But if I had known how to click the link and go to--
[01:13:31.280 --> 01:13:32.280]   I probably wouldn't have done it.
[01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:34.200]   Well, how long after-- I can't remember how long after it
[01:13:34.200 --> 01:13:35.760]   took me to cancel AOL.
[01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:36.960]   Yeah, same thing.
[01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:39.440]   And they just kind of slowly draw the money.
[01:13:39.440 --> 01:13:41.400]   Well, here's the one I need.
[01:13:41.400 --> 01:13:41.760]   What?
[01:13:41.760 --> 01:13:44.440]   Is whenever I go to Europe, I sign up for the extra day--
[01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:46.640]   I opt to $100 for one month for extra data,
[01:13:46.640 --> 01:13:47.280]   so I can use my phone.
[01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:48.440]   Another great one.
[01:13:48.440 --> 01:13:49.440]   And then I always forget.
[01:13:49.440 --> 01:13:50.400]   And they always take two months.
[01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:52.280]   Don't do it right away because the middle will come in.
[01:13:52.280 --> 01:13:54.040]   My wife went up the other day and she said, well, did you cancel?
[01:13:54.040 --> 01:13:56.280]   I said, no, but I'm going back to Europe.
[01:13:56.280 --> 01:13:58.480]   So no, I do that all the time.
[01:13:58.480 --> 01:13:59.560]   Yeah.
[01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:00.920]   This is good.
[01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:05.520]   I have many iOS magazines, subscriptions, that just sort
[01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:09.040]   of pile up on my iPad, which is not charged.
[01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:10.680]   That will not work with this.
[01:14:10.680 --> 01:14:12.400]   But I think this is pretty good.
[01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:13.800]   You can still ask for a reminder,
[01:14:13.800 --> 01:14:14.680]   we won't have a link to it.
[01:14:14.680 --> 01:14:17.680]   That is very interesting that Google would get into this business.
[01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:19.800]   It was kind of interesting.
[01:14:19.800 --> 01:14:21.240]   It's a little weird.
[01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:22.120]   It's a little weird.
[01:14:22.120 --> 01:14:23.000]   And yet it's there.
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:24.040]   So there you go, kids.
[01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:26.720]   Cancel everything that's not Google.
[01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:27.920]   Can you-- well, wait a minute.
[01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:30.120]   Can I say cancel Google Wallet?
[01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:30.960]   I mean--
[01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:33.160]   Cancel Google Listen or Google Personal Access?
[01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:34.080]   That's a good question.
[01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:34.840]   That's a good question.
[01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:35.640]   We should try it out.
[01:14:35.640 --> 01:14:38.800]   I would think so.
[01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:40.760]   Cancel Amazon Prime.
[01:14:40.760 --> 01:14:41.280]   Yeah.
[01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:43.200]   I'd love it that that's the example that you're--
[01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:45.000]   And there should be a little incentive
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:46.760]   for Google Shopping Express.
[01:14:46.760 --> 01:14:47.240]   Yeah.
[01:14:47.240 --> 01:14:47.760]   So yeah.
[01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:48.240]   Where you go?
[01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:49.200]   Well, it is funny being out here.
[01:14:49.200 --> 01:14:50.840]   You do see the Google delivery trucks.
[01:14:50.840 --> 01:14:51.200]   Oh, yeah.
[01:14:51.200 --> 01:14:51.880]   And I went all over.
[01:14:51.880 --> 01:14:53.240]   And Amazon delivery trucks.
[01:14:53.240 --> 01:14:53.640]   Oh, yeah.
[01:14:53.640 --> 01:14:54.600]   Geez.
[01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:58.120]   Referral territory for those guys.
[01:14:58.120 --> 01:14:59.200]   Yes we are.
[01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:00.200]   Oh, yeah.
[01:15:00.200 --> 01:15:01.040]   Here it is.
[01:15:01.040 --> 01:15:04.200]   Thank you, Ben, for an updated image.
[01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:05.440]   Thank you, Ben.
[01:15:05.440 --> 01:15:07.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:15:07.440 --> 01:15:08.840]   Oh, we got complete with glass too.
[01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:10.840]   It was very good.
[01:15:10.840 --> 01:15:14.000]   Now that's Photoshop Wizardry.
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.040]   I like it.
[01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:19.160]   We should use that as our album art for today's show.
[01:15:19.160 --> 01:15:20.160]   That'd be great.
[01:15:20.160 --> 01:15:22.600]   That's awesome.
[01:15:22.600 --> 01:15:25.000]   I actually think that looks better than the original.
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:25.480]   It does.
[01:15:25.480 --> 01:15:26.320]   It's great.
[01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:28.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:15:28.280 --> 01:15:32.920]   Miss Piggy, Stattler, and Waldorf, the hosts.
[01:15:32.920 --> 01:15:35.160]   What other voices sound like that, Lumber?
[01:15:35.160 --> 01:15:36.840]   Yeah, oh, man.
[01:15:36.840 --> 01:15:37.320]   I don't remember.
[01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:39.120]   Although I did like to be a physical commentary
[01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:40.000]   when you guys were playing.
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:40.600]   Yes, it was just you.
[01:15:40.600 --> 01:15:41.120]   Yes.
[01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:42.200]   That was the real--
[01:15:42.200 --> 01:15:42.720]   you know.
[01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:44.440]   You know that was really the intent.
[01:15:44.440 --> 01:15:45.200]   All along.
[01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:47.120]   Yeah.
[01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:49.240]   Ladies and gentlemen, it is time for a number.
[01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:50.960]   I see you have several, Jeffrey.
[01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:52.200]   Always, always prepared.
[01:15:52.200 --> 01:15:54.000]   Always for anyone with a number.
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:56.080]   Well, I guess maybe we could do eight things
[01:15:56.080 --> 01:15:57.680]   to look for in I/O.
[01:15:57.680 --> 01:15:58.520]   Eight things.
[01:15:58.520 --> 01:15:59.600]   Eight things to look for in I/O.
[01:15:59.600 --> 01:16:02.000]   There's also a video of 10 things to expect in I/O,
[01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.240]   but I didn't watch the video, so I don't know what it's like.
[01:16:04.240 --> 01:16:05.120]   Two more than eight.
[01:16:05.120 --> 01:16:06.320]   Two more than eight.
[01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:07.640]   So what do we have there?
[01:16:07.640 --> 01:16:10.120]   We have-- it's one of those bloody slide shows.
[01:16:10.120 --> 01:16:11.120]   You got to go through it.
[01:16:11.120 --> 01:16:11.840]   Oh, I hate that stuff.
[01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:12.920]   I hate them.
[01:16:12.920 --> 01:16:15.560]   Should I go through it for you so you don't have to?
[01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:16.040]   Let's do it.
[01:16:16.040 --> 01:16:17.040]   Information week.
[01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:19.760]   So number one is the Nexus 8.
[01:16:19.760 --> 01:16:21.040]   Will we have a Nexus 8?
[01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:22.120]   Should we vote on this?
[01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:22.640]   What do you think?
[01:16:22.640 --> 01:16:23.160]   Nexus 8?
[01:16:23.160 --> 01:16:24.120]   Yes, no.
[01:16:24.120 --> 01:16:24.800]   Nexus 8.
[01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:26.480]   Oh, that would be a eight-inch tablet.
[01:16:26.480 --> 01:16:29.280]   A new Nexus tablet.
[01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:29.720]   What do you think?
[01:16:29.720 --> 01:16:30.640]   Gina?
[01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:31.160]   No.
[01:16:31.160 --> 01:16:31.720]   No.
[01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:32.160]   No.
[01:16:32.160 --> 01:16:32.600]   No.
[01:16:32.600 --> 01:16:33.720]   OK, no.
[01:16:33.720 --> 01:16:37.240]   Next one is Android 4.5.
[01:16:37.240 --> 01:16:39.640]   I'm getting an ad in every single slide.
[01:16:39.640 --> 01:16:42.520]   Oh, geez.
[01:16:42.520 --> 01:16:43.080]   Only.
[01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:45.440]   Come molly.
[01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:46.160]   What was the next one?
[01:16:46.160 --> 01:16:49.040]   Next one is Android 4.5.
[01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:51.000]   Yeah, I don't know about the version number,
[01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.960]   but yes, on the redesign.
[01:16:53.960 --> 01:16:56.600]   A flat her motif, fewer textures and shadows.
[01:16:56.600 --> 01:16:57.600]   Like I care.
[01:16:57.600 --> 01:16:59.720]   Android hostess hoho.
[01:16:59.720 --> 01:17:02.080]   No, it's K-H, right?
[01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:03.600]   Hostess hoho.
[01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:04.720]   Android hoho.
[01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:05.240]   Right.
[01:17:05.240 --> 01:17:06.200]   Yeah.
[01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:06.840]   What did I say here?
[01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:09.000]   Just says something about that, I thought.
[01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:09.680]   Moonshine.
[01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:10.600]   Code name Moonshine.
[01:17:10.600 --> 01:17:11.280]   No, I don't know.
[01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:12.560]   But it's got to have an H, right?
[01:17:12.560 --> 01:17:13.760]   It's a dessert with an H.
[01:17:13.760 --> 01:17:14.080]   Oh, right.
[01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:14.280]   Oh, right.
[01:17:14.280 --> 01:17:15.880]   We just did KitKat.
[01:17:15.880 --> 01:17:17.080]   Let's say version up KitKat.
[01:17:17.080 --> 01:17:17.440]   Wait a minute.
[01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:18.440]   I don't know my alphabet.
[01:17:18.440 --> 01:17:20.800]   L.
[01:17:20.800 --> 01:17:21.320]   L.
[01:17:21.320 --> 01:17:22.880]   What would L be?
[01:17:22.880 --> 01:17:23.880]   Lollipop?
[01:17:23.880 --> 01:17:26.160]   Lollipop?
[01:17:26.160 --> 01:17:27.240]   Or Likamade?
[01:17:27.240 --> 01:17:28.080]   Likarish?
[01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:29.680]   Likarish.
[01:17:29.680 --> 01:17:30.480]   Lemonheads.
[01:17:30.480 --> 01:17:31.080]   Lemonheads.
[01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:31.680]   That's a quote.
[01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:32.680]   Lemonheads.
[01:17:32.680 --> 01:17:33.680]   Android lemonheads.
[01:17:33.680 --> 01:17:34.920]   Who's going to get the mad--
[01:17:34.920 --> 01:17:36.440]   you know, I'm sure they're calling them right now.
[01:17:36.440 --> 01:17:36.880]   Likarish.
[01:17:36.880 --> 01:17:37.440]   I never liked--
[01:17:37.440 --> 01:17:38.480]   Likarish is in a dessert.
[01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:40.440]   Oh.
[01:17:40.440 --> 01:17:43.240]   Do you like the licorice, then?
[01:17:43.240 --> 01:17:44.160]   These are delicious.
[01:17:44.160 --> 01:17:44.920]   They are.
[01:17:44.920 --> 01:17:46.760]   Natural.
[01:17:46.760 --> 01:17:47.480]   Red vines.
[01:17:47.480 --> 01:17:49.440]   I didn't know licorice was unnatural.
[01:17:49.440 --> 01:17:51.360]   Well, you can get a natural licorice.
[01:17:51.360 --> 01:17:52.920]   You got natural anything.
[01:17:52.920 --> 01:17:54.280]   I'll do a later.
[01:17:54.280 --> 01:17:55.280]   I don't remember.
[01:17:55.280 --> 01:17:57.400]   I said I'm irritated by people who do open mouth chewing.
[01:17:57.400 --> 01:17:58.600]   I don't chew when dying.
[01:17:58.600 --> 01:17:59.600]   Yes.
[01:17:59.600 --> 01:18:00.600]   I do.
[01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:01.560]   The memory would annoy a California.
[01:18:01.560 --> 01:18:02.480]   Number four.
[01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:03.960]   Gmail.
[01:18:03.960 --> 01:18:06.640]   Oh, we didn't even mention the changes in Gmail
[01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:08.760]   that have just appeared.
[01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:09.200]   Well--
[01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:10.960]   Or did you mention the change log?
[01:18:10.960 --> 01:18:12.280]   They haven't come out, right?
[01:18:12.280 --> 01:18:13.480]   This is still rumor.
[01:18:13.480 --> 01:18:14.000]   It's a rumor.
[01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:14.360]   It's a rumor.
[01:18:14.360 --> 01:18:14.800]   I think.
[01:18:14.800 --> 01:18:15.360]   Yeah.
[01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:15.360]   Yeah.
[01:18:15.360 --> 01:18:16.440]   Which is what I didn't do.
[01:18:16.440 --> 01:18:19.560]   So you think you think you'll announce a new Gmail at I/O?
[01:18:19.560 --> 01:18:20.800]   I'm yes on this.
[01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:21.760]   I think this is going to happen.
[01:18:21.760 --> 01:18:23.160]   I think that they are testing this.
[01:18:23.160 --> 01:18:24.840]   I think there's going to be some new stuff in Gmail.
[01:18:24.840 --> 01:18:26.200]   I think this redesign is going to happen.
[01:18:26.200 --> 01:18:29.680]   I think there's going to be some tasks and upcoming--
[01:18:29.680 --> 01:18:30.200]   Google--
[01:18:30.200 --> 01:18:36.200]   Can you stop redesigning Gmail and just make it iMap, please?
[01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:39.360]   I beg of you, this fake iMap is confused.
[01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:42.240]   I cannot find a good mail client on the Macintosh.
[01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:44.000]   And I've tried them all now.
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:46.240]   The only ones that are any good are just a window
[01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:49.000]   to the Google website, the Gmail website.
[01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:49.720]   Wow.
[01:18:49.720 --> 01:18:55.120]   Because it's not a traditional iMap implementation,
[01:18:55.120 --> 01:18:58.000]   mostly because it doesn't do folders.
[01:18:58.000 --> 01:18:59.600]   It does filters.
[01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:03.680]   But it doesn't use iMap tags, even though it could use iMac.
[01:19:03.680 --> 01:19:05.840]   Anyway, it's just fixable.
[01:19:05.840 --> 01:19:08.280]   Yeah, it's because you can do multiple labels.
[01:19:08.280 --> 01:19:08.480]   Right.
[01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:09.480]   You can have more than one--
[01:19:09.480 --> 01:19:10.320]   Yes.
[01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:12.040]   It's not a one to one folder.
[01:19:12.040 --> 01:19:14.360]   What Google could do is Gmail at I/O that I think
[01:19:14.360 --> 01:19:17.920]   we get an innovation would be adding an encryption.
[01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:18.440]   They will do--
[01:19:18.440 --> 01:19:21.120]   All right, I'm going to add that to this list.
[01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:22.000]   We just made it nine.
[01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:22.480]   Encryption.
[01:19:22.480 --> 01:19:23.760]   Absolutely encryption.
[01:19:23.760 --> 01:19:25.200]   I bet you then is, in fact.
[01:19:25.200 --> 01:19:26.920]   Because that's the crowd that will respond.
[01:19:26.920 --> 01:19:27.680]   Yep.
[01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:31.800]   All right, next is focus on design.
[01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:33.280]   Are you?
[01:19:33.280 --> 01:19:34.240]   Yes.
[01:19:34.240 --> 01:19:35.280]   They announced that already.
[01:19:35.280 --> 01:19:38.000]   They said that this is going to be the design Google I/O.
[01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:39.040]   All right, fine.
[01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:41.000]   Everything these days is design, design, design.
[01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:41.800]   We go all around the valley.
[01:19:41.800 --> 01:19:42.360]   And it's--
[01:19:42.360 --> 01:19:44.080]   I'm designing--
[01:19:44.080 --> 01:19:44.600]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:19:44.600 --> 01:19:46.920]   I'm thinking of Helvetica.
[01:19:46.920 --> 01:19:47.920]   All right, next.
[01:19:47.920 --> 01:19:49.400]   A Nexus 6 phone.
[01:19:49.400 --> 01:19:50.520]   A Nexus 6.
[01:19:50.520 --> 01:19:52.040]   They're going to have a name collision.
[01:19:52.040 --> 01:19:53.400]   They're about to.
[01:19:53.400 --> 01:19:54.760]   Yeah, they got a problem.
[01:19:54.760 --> 01:19:55.720]   This might be the last one.
[01:19:55.720 --> 01:19:56.480]   What is the LG?
[01:19:56.480 --> 01:19:59.440]   LG is going to have a 7, an 8, an 8, 3, and a 10.
[01:19:59.440 --> 01:20:00.560]   I think this is where you go to.
[01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:00.960]   What was it?
[01:20:00.960 --> 01:20:02.680]   Silver that they were proposing it.
[01:20:02.680 --> 01:20:04.680]   Yeah, I think it's going to be Android Silver.
[01:20:04.680 --> 01:20:07.080]   This is where you do Android Silver instead of Nexus 6,
[01:20:07.080 --> 01:20:08.280]   because it can't be a Nexus 7.
[01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:09.040]   There already is.
[01:20:09.040 --> 01:20:11.760]   So I think you make the change now.
[01:20:11.760 --> 01:20:14.040]   6A, 6B.
[01:20:14.040 --> 01:20:14.920]   No, you go--
[01:20:14.920 --> 01:20:15.560]   What do you think?
[01:20:15.560 --> 01:20:16.200]   What do you think?
[01:20:16.200 --> 01:20:17.640]   Nexus 6 and I/O?
[01:20:17.640 --> 01:20:18.140]   No.
[01:20:18.140 --> 01:20:20.320]   Do you know?
[01:20:20.320 --> 01:20:21.080]   I don't think so.
[01:20:21.080 --> 01:20:21.640]   I don't mean either.
[01:20:21.640 --> 01:20:22.160]   Nope.
[01:20:22.160 --> 01:20:22.840]   All right.
[01:20:22.840 --> 01:20:25.200]   I think maybe silver, though.
[01:20:25.200 --> 01:20:26.640]   You think maybe a new phone?
[01:20:26.640 --> 01:20:27.640]   Oh, so a new phone, right?
[01:20:27.640 --> 01:20:32.000]   Silver would be a silver edition of mainstream phones
[01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:33.800]   like Google Play Edition, right?
[01:20:33.800 --> 01:20:34.440]   Is that right, Gina?
[01:20:34.440 --> 01:20:35.640]   Is that what the--
[01:20:35.640 --> 01:20:38.120]   Yes, similar to Google Play Edition, but consumer focused.
[01:20:38.120 --> 01:20:38.600]   Yeah.
[01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:39.040]   OK.
[01:20:39.040 --> 01:20:41.400]   Silver is kind of like Microsoft did with Windows 8,
[01:20:41.400 --> 01:20:43.520]   a signature series where it didn't have a lot of crap
[01:20:43.520 --> 01:20:44.280]   where and stuff like that.
[01:20:44.280 --> 01:20:47.280]   All right, number seven is Android 5.
[01:20:47.280 --> 01:20:49.800]   A big Android change.
[01:20:49.800 --> 01:20:51.320]   They have been nuked for big change.
[01:20:51.320 --> 01:20:53.840]   Android 5 milkedud.
[01:20:53.840 --> 01:20:55.800]   Oh, that's probably not a good name for us.
[01:20:55.800 --> 01:20:57.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:20:57.760 --> 01:21:00.200]   Marshmallow.
[01:21:00.200 --> 01:21:00.720]   Malomar.
[01:21:00.720 --> 01:21:02.000]   From a fresh food-named hair rock.
[01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:03.000]   Malomar.
[01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:04.000]   Malomar.
[01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:05.000]   Android Malomar.
[01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:05.520]   I'll get talking.
[01:21:05.520 --> 01:21:07.000]   That's a brand name I can get behind.
[01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:08.000]   Ooh.
[01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:09.000]   Mm-hmm.
[01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.120]   Reportedly allows a device to perform a task
[01:21:11.120 --> 01:21:13.200]   normally associated with a particular app only
[01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:15.280]   without having to open the app to do it.
[01:21:15.280 --> 01:21:16.280]   What?
[01:21:16.280 --> 01:21:17.280]   What the hell?
[01:21:17.280 --> 01:21:18.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:21:18.680 --> 01:21:20.000]   What?
[01:21:20.000 --> 01:21:21.960]   Well, what?
[01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:22.480]   Yeah, no.
[01:21:22.480 --> 01:21:22.980]   No.
[01:21:22.980 --> 01:21:23.480]   No?
[01:21:23.480 --> 01:21:24.480]   This is going to happen.
[01:21:24.480 --> 01:21:26.520]   I don't even understand what they're talking about.
[01:21:26.520 --> 01:21:28.120]   All right, next.
[01:21:28.120 --> 01:21:28.880]   Mark's a pop.
[01:21:28.880 --> 01:21:31.800]   Google+ refocused.
[01:21:31.800 --> 01:21:33.720]   All right, here's the question.
[01:21:33.720 --> 01:21:34.680]   Here's the question.
[01:21:34.680 --> 01:21:36.880]   Will they talk about Google+ at I/O?
[01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:37.960]   Yes.
[01:21:37.960 --> 01:21:40.200]   Do you know?
[01:21:40.200 --> 01:21:43.680]   I think it could be Uncle Ted we don't talk about.
[01:21:43.680 --> 01:21:45.160]   I don't think they do.
[01:21:45.160 --> 01:21:45.680]   Yeah.
[01:21:45.680 --> 01:21:46.680]   You don't think--
[01:21:46.680 --> 01:21:47.680]   Either of you--
[01:21:47.680 --> 01:21:48.680]   I think they talk--
[01:21:48.680 --> 01:21:49.680]   I should make a bingo card out of this.
[01:21:49.680 --> 01:21:50.680]   They're going to talk about hangouts.
[01:21:50.680 --> 01:21:53.440]   They're going to talk about hangouts and photos, but they're not going to talk about Google+
[01:21:53.440 --> 01:21:54.440]   or pull out.
[01:21:54.440 --> 01:21:55.440]   Not plus.
[01:21:55.440 --> 01:21:56.440]   You know?
[01:21:56.440 --> 01:21:57.440]   God, I'm going to be depressed if they do that.
[01:21:57.440 --> 01:21:58.440]   I don't believe it.
[01:21:58.440 --> 01:21:59.920]   I think they will talk about it.
[01:21:59.920 --> 01:22:00.920]   And--
[01:22:00.920 --> 01:22:01.920]   But this is good.
[01:22:01.920 --> 01:22:02.920]   We should make notes on this.
[01:22:02.920 --> 01:22:03.920]   Sure, this is good.
[01:22:03.920 --> 01:22:04.920]   Because we're going to--
[01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:05.920]   You should bet.
[01:22:05.920 --> 01:22:06.920]   Bingo card.
[01:22:06.920 --> 01:22:07.920]   Bingo card.
[01:22:07.920 --> 01:22:08.920]   Find the coffee on the way to the show.
[01:22:08.920 --> 01:22:09.920]   I'm going to stay here.
[01:22:09.920 --> 01:22:13.120]   So I'm going to do the keynote while you guys are at the show.
[01:22:13.120 --> 01:22:15.800]   And then you're going to whip up here afterwards as we've done in the past.
[01:22:15.800 --> 01:22:17.280]   And we'll do this week in Google afterwards.
[01:22:17.280 --> 01:22:18.280]   Jeff on the bridge.
[01:22:18.280 --> 01:22:19.280]   Mike Elgin.
[01:22:19.280 --> 01:22:20.480]   I'm actually maybe-- is Mike going?
[01:22:20.480 --> 01:22:22.560]   He is going.
[01:22:22.560 --> 01:22:26.400]   Everybody's going-- Jason's going-- I'm going to be all alone here.
[01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:29.760]   Chad-- is that Liz?
[01:22:29.760 --> 01:22:30.760]   Is that Liz?
[01:22:30.760 --> 01:22:34.680]   Chad and I will be-- oh, no, that was-- that was Tanya, wasn't it?
[01:22:34.680 --> 01:22:36.240]   Tanya, you can join me.
[01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:38.120]   We'll be covering it from here as the keynote.
[01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:39.120]   And I will make a note.
[01:22:39.120 --> 01:22:40.120]   So it's in Tanya?
[01:22:40.120 --> 01:22:41.120]   No, that's Liz.
[01:22:41.120 --> 01:22:42.120]   It's bouncing.
[01:22:42.120 --> 01:22:43.120]   Yeah.
[01:22:43.120 --> 01:22:44.120]   Hello, Liz.
[01:22:44.120 --> 01:22:45.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:22:45.120 --> 01:22:46.120]   It's all a snap of bouncing right now.
[01:22:46.120 --> 01:22:47.120]   It's all a snap of bouncing right now.
[01:22:47.120 --> 01:22:52.680]   And then when Google doesn't-- you know, as we tick to the end of the keynote, will Larry
[01:22:52.680 --> 01:22:54.120]   Page do his--
[01:22:54.120 --> 01:22:55.120]   Here's the real question.
[01:22:55.120 --> 01:22:56.520]   No, no, no.
[01:22:56.520 --> 01:23:00.560]   What's the question Robert Scobel is going to ask of Larry Page?
[01:23:00.560 --> 01:23:04.040]   Will they let Scobel go to the microphone this time, or will he be tackled before he
[01:23:04.040 --> 01:23:05.360]   gets anywhere near it?
[01:23:05.360 --> 01:23:06.360]   Aw.
[01:23:06.360 --> 01:23:11.560]   And then number nine, number nine, number nine, is something wild.
[01:23:11.560 --> 01:23:12.560]   Will there be something wild?
[01:23:12.560 --> 01:23:14.560]   A Nexus Q-type device.
[01:23:14.560 --> 01:23:15.560]   Yes.
[01:23:15.560 --> 01:23:17.360]   Something-- something we couldn't anticipate, something we could get up here and we all
[01:23:17.360 --> 01:23:18.960]   admit we were surprised.
[01:23:18.960 --> 01:23:23.360]   Will we all get here and admit the surprise after I/O?
[01:23:23.360 --> 01:23:25.360]   Gina?
[01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:26.360]   Ah.
[01:23:26.360 --> 01:23:27.360]   I don't think so.
[01:23:27.360 --> 01:23:28.360]   I don't think so.
[01:23:28.360 --> 01:23:29.360]   Although, where's my watch?
[01:23:29.360 --> 01:23:34.160]   There's no mention of a watch here.
[01:23:34.160 --> 01:23:35.160]   I want to watch.
[01:23:35.160 --> 01:23:39.080]   This is the time frame for the Moto X watch.
[01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:41.520]   I don't think we're going to get blinds.
[01:23:41.520 --> 01:23:45.000]   I'm excited by something from my field, like the Q, this year.
[01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:46.760]   I mean, I love that.
[01:23:46.760 --> 01:23:49.000]   It's awesomely fun, right?
[01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:50.840]   But I don't think so.
[01:23:50.840 --> 01:23:51.840]   But that's just a guess.
[01:23:51.840 --> 01:23:53.440]   How about an update to Chromecast?
[01:23:53.440 --> 01:23:54.440]   Update.
[01:23:54.440 --> 01:23:56.720]   That's got to be a successful one.
[01:23:56.720 --> 01:23:57.720]   That's not a--
[01:23:57.720 --> 01:23:58.720]   What about Android TV?
[01:23:58.720 --> 01:24:01.760]   Didn't they say we're going to replace Google TV with Android TV?
[01:24:01.760 --> 01:24:02.760]   That might be a product.
[01:24:02.760 --> 01:24:05.680]   Android TV might be that-- that could be a surprise.
[01:24:05.680 --> 01:24:06.680]   Yeah.
[01:24:06.680 --> 01:24:10.800]   Motorola did not add its event and announced a new X.
[01:24:10.800 --> 01:24:11.800]   Did they?
[01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:12.800]   An X plus one.
[01:24:12.800 --> 01:24:13.800]   Did they announce the E?
[01:24:13.800 --> 01:24:14.800]   They announced the E.
[01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:17.800]   And they announced the G, right, with the LTE.
[01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:18.800]   Right.
[01:24:18.800 --> 01:24:24.160]   But no, both of which are very low-end, low-price phones for the developing one.
[01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:25.160]   It's a huge, huge bank.
[01:24:25.160 --> 01:24:26.160]   It's a huge, huge bank.
[01:24:26.160 --> 01:24:27.160]   Right.
[01:24:27.160 --> 01:24:28.160]   An X-interesting phone.
[01:24:28.160 --> 01:24:31.760]   I feel like Motorola-- well, the Motorola deal hasn't closed.
[01:24:31.760 --> 01:24:34.360]   They're still Google, but they're on the way out.
[01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:35.360]   What's that only?
[01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:36.360]   What are you carrying now?
[01:24:36.360 --> 01:24:38.600]   This is the M8, the same one that Gina uses.
[01:24:38.600 --> 01:24:40.800]   I don't use the Google Play Edition.
[01:24:40.800 --> 01:24:42.360]   I use the HTC Edition.
[01:24:42.360 --> 01:24:43.880]   But I do like this phone.
[01:24:43.880 --> 01:24:47.720]   You know, we played with, and I think-- did Jason show you yesterday?
[01:24:47.720 --> 01:24:49.160]   The Harman Carden edition of this?
[01:24:49.160 --> 01:24:50.160]   The audio file edition.
[01:24:50.160 --> 01:24:51.160]   Yeah, he did.
[01:24:51.160 --> 01:24:52.160]   Yeah, he did.
[01:24:52.160 --> 01:24:53.160]   Yeah, what do you think?
[01:24:53.160 --> 01:24:54.160]   I liked the sound quality.
[01:24:54.160 --> 01:24:56.720]   I thought the sound quality was actually better.
[01:24:56.720 --> 01:25:01.880]   But I don't know if I would say spend $50 more on a phone just because of some better
[01:25:01.880 --> 01:25:04.200]   headphones and some improved sound quality.
[01:25:04.200 --> 01:25:05.200]   Because it looks the same.
[01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:06.920]   You're stuck with crazy headphones, right?
[01:25:06.920 --> 01:25:10.480]   Yeah, and you're stuck with a black versus some of the other choices in college.
[01:25:10.480 --> 01:25:12.360]   Yeah, Jason, I can see your fingerprints.
[01:25:12.360 --> 01:25:13.760]   Yeah, you know what?
[01:25:13.760 --> 01:25:15.400]   That phone is brand new, and it looks--
[01:25:15.400 --> 01:25:21.000]   Either that or you've eaten the potato chips, haven't you?
[01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000]   And I don't like the black and gold so much.
[01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.160]   Gina, do you have the gray, the steel?
[01:25:25.160 --> 01:25:26.160]   Mm-hmm.
[01:25:26.160 --> 01:25:27.840]   But look how dented mine is.
[01:25:27.840 --> 01:25:29.480]   Wow.
[01:25:29.480 --> 01:25:31.560]   And then there's lots of scratches here.
[01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:36.640]   You know, Sherlock Holmes noted that a drunk must live at a house because of all the
[01:25:36.640 --> 01:25:40.480]   scratches around the keyhole.
[01:25:40.480 --> 01:25:41.480]   Do you remember that?
[01:25:41.480 --> 01:25:42.480]   Yeah.
[01:25:42.480 --> 01:25:43.480]   OK.
[01:25:43.480 --> 01:25:46.600]   Well, you might think I was a drunk as well because of all the scratches around the USB
[01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:47.600]   port.
[01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:49.320]   It's because you never go what's up and down.
[01:25:49.320 --> 01:25:50.320]   I can't.
[01:25:50.320 --> 01:25:51.800]   I always do it wrong.
[01:25:51.800 --> 01:25:52.800]   Scratch.
[01:25:52.800 --> 01:25:53.800]   Scratch.
[01:25:53.800 --> 01:25:54.800]   Scratch.
[01:25:54.800 --> 01:25:55.800]   It has three sides.
[01:25:55.800 --> 01:25:56.800]   Yeah, none of them fit.
[01:25:56.800 --> 01:26:01.400]   There's always pitch black, and I'm trying to plug nothing in at night.
[01:26:01.400 --> 01:26:02.560]   I haven't done my job.
[01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:04.040]   I am tool-less today.
[01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:05.040]   I'm sorry to say.
[01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:06.040]   Oh, did you try?
[01:26:06.040 --> 01:26:07.960]   Did you try the Yahoo News Digest?
[01:26:07.960 --> 01:26:09.360]   Oh, that's the new--
[01:26:09.360 --> 01:26:11.280]   Yeah, I've used it.
[01:26:11.280 --> 01:26:14.040]   I've used it on iOS.
[01:26:14.040 --> 01:26:15.040]   It's on here now.
[01:26:15.040 --> 01:26:16.040]   And I kind of like it.
[01:26:16.040 --> 01:26:17.040]   Do you like it?
[01:26:17.040 --> 01:26:18.040]   Really?
[01:26:18.040 --> 01:26:19.040]   Well--
[01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:20.040]   Yeah, it's on Android now.
[01:26:20.040 --> 01:26:21.040]   It was like a flashlight.
[01:26:21.040 --> 01:26:22.040]   Yeah, it's on the internet.
[01:26:22.040 --> 01:26:24.040]   You don't get it?
[01:26:24.040 --> 01:26:25.680]   Oh, you got it.
[01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:27.880]   You know, New York Times Now is also doing that.
[01:26:27.880 --> 01:26:29.360]   Oh, they have Android yet or not.
[01:26:29.360 --> 01:26:30.360]   Not yet.
[01:26:30.360 --> 01:26:31.360]   OK, that's the--
[01:26:31.360 --> 01:26:35.800]   But the idea is that instead of wading through all these articles on YouTube, you know, you
[01:26:35.800 --> 01:26:39.720]   have articles on all these things that you have to read, why don't we just pick, you
[01:26:39.720 --> 01:26:41.720]   know, nine stories that are important?
[01:26:41.720 --> 01:26:44.560]   And in fact, we won't even give you all the text of the story.
[01:26:44.560 --> 01:26:45.840]   We'll just give you a summary.
[01:26:45.840 --> 01:26:49.160]   Because you're a busy person and you don't need it like that.
[01:26:49.160 --> 01:26:50.160]   That's the idea.
[01:26:50.160 --> 01:26:52.760]   But you can click on it and drill down and get more information.
[01:26:52.760 --> 01:26:53.920]   And I actually kind of like it.
[01:26:53.920 --> 01:26:54.920]   Here it is.
[01:26:54.920 --> 01:26:55.920]   Do I have--
[01:26:55.920 --> 01:26:56.920]   Do I have a little bit of that?
[01:26:56.920 --> 01:26:57.920]   What's the name of that?
[01:26:57.920 --> 01:26:58.920]   I can't-- because I can find it.
[01:26:58.920 --> 01:26:59.920]   Yeah, it's down a little ways.
[01:26:59.920 --> 01:27:00.920]   Yahoo News Digest.
[01:27:00.920 --> 01:27:01.920]   It's very pretty.
[01:27:01.920 --> 01:27:05.600]   And this was the way it was on iOS as well.
[01:27:05.600 --> 01:27:09.160]   So this is Wednesday morning's Digest.
[01:27:09.160 --> 01:27:11.360]   And they literally give you just nine stories.
[01:27:11.360 --> 01:27:12.360]   Oops.
[01:27:12.360 --> 01:27:13.960]   Oh, so that's different from iOS.
[01:27:13.960 --> 01:27:15.880]   iOS, you go down.
[01:27:15.880 --> 01:27:19.520]   So to go down, if you want to read more about it, this is the coal miners in Turkey.
[01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:23.120]   And you see, as you go, you're going to get pictures.
[01:27:23.120 --> 01:27:24.880]   You're going to get videos.
[01:27:24.880 --> 01:27:27.680]   And you just keep going down if you want to have more detail.
[01:27:27.680 --> 01:27:28.680]   Right?
[01:27:28.680 --> 01:27:33.000]   So I think that that's kind of nice, even down to tweets and references.
[01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:34.680]   But the idea is you don't have to drill down.
[01:27:34.680 --> 01:27:36.760]   You could just say, oh, there's that headline.
[01:27:36.760 --> 01:27:38.240]   That's story one.
[01:27:38.240 --> 01:27:41.920]   Story two wildfire season opens thousands in San Diego.
[01:27:41.920 --> 01:27:43.480]   Flea.
[01:27:43.480 --> 01:27:44.480]   Court order.
[01:27:44.480 --> 01:27:47.960]   Judge calls for bestoriously undergo mental evaluation.
[01:27:47.960 --> 01:27:48.960]   Military dilemma.
[01:27:48.960 --> 01:27:53.120]   Pentagon OK's Manning's transfer for gender treatment.
[01:27:53.120 --> 01:27:54.120]   Ruled unconstitutional.
[01:27:54.120 --> 01:27:56.880]   Judge strikes down Idaho's same sex marriage ban.
[01:27:56.880 --> 01:28:00.040]   Now, one of these stories was in twig so far.
[01:28:00.040 --> 01:28:08.560]   To finish to the Clippers game, the stay to Texas execution.
[01:28:08.560 --> 01:28:11.920]   Swedish Oscar winning director of searching for Sugarman died.
[01:28:11.920 --> 01:28:12.920]   He was fat.
[01:28:12.920 --> 01:28:13.920]   That is a great movie.
[01:28:13.920 --> 01:28:14.920]   I didn't.
[01:28:14.920 --> 01:28:15.920]   That's terrible.
[01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:16.920]   So you want to know more?
[01:28:16.920 --> 01:28:17.920]   So again, you see what happened there?
[01:28:17.920 --> 01:28:20.360]   That was the first one that got me interested.
[01:28:20.360 --> 01:28:24.120]   If you haven't seen searching for Sugarman, that's a fascinating documentary with quite
[01:28:24.120 --> 01:28:26.520]   a twist about halfway through.
[01:28:26.520 --> 01:28:31.280]   Tony posting a $1.3 billion quarterly loss.
[01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:32.440]   So that was nine stories.
[01:28:32.440 --> 01:28:33.960]   Oh, there's 10.
[01:28:33.960 --> 01:28:36.480]   Michael Jackson's thriller.
[01:28:36.480 --> 01:28:39.120]   New album number one in over 50 countries.
[01:28:39.120 --> 01:28:41.520]   And then did you know?
[01:28:41.520 --> 01:28:42.520]   That's interesting.
[01:28:42.520 --> 01:28:46.080]   But then I also got a little thing that said, I don't have it now.
[01:28:46.080 --> 01:28:48.600]   How many stories I've gone through?
[01:28:48.600 --> 01:28:53.480]   I think this is a lot of editorial judgment on it.
[01:28:53.480 --> 01:28:55.520]   I don't know if it's not all automated or no.
[01:28:55.520 --> 01:28:56.520]   Yeah, I think so.
[01:28:56.520 --> 01:28:59.680]   I don't know if it gets smarter.
[01:28:59.680 --> 01:29:00.680]   You can--
[01:29:00.680 --> 01:29:01.880]   Yeah, it's pretty straightforward.
[01:29:01.880 --> 01:29:03.640]   You get one in the morning, 8 a.m.
[01:29:03.640 --> 01:29:04.640]   What's the big deal?
[01:29:04.640 --> 01:29:09.560]   The United States, UK, Canada, and international editions.
[01:29:09.560 --> 01:29:12.200]   It's just a quick way to catch up on the news on your commute.
[01:29:12.200 --> 01:29:13.200]   Right.
[01:29:13.200 --> 01:29:14.200]   You know?
[01:29:14.200 --> 01:29:16.240]   And actually, I think I've called it New York Times.
[01:29:16.240 --> 01:29:17.720]   You can get pretty deep.
[01:29:17.720 --> 01:29:22.560]   Well, New York Times now is very much the same idea, except you have to pay for it.
[01:29:22.560 --> 01:29:23.560]   Right.
[01:29:23.560 --> 01:29:24.560]   This is free from the island.
[01:29:24.560 --> 01:29:25.560]   I love this island.
[01:29:25.560 --> 01:29:27.360]   And I'll pay for it.
[01:29:27.360 --> 01:29:28.360]   Yeah.
[01:29:28.360 --> 01:29:31.400]   One of my favorite tweets today was the editor of the New York Times, "Joleberenson just got
[01:29:31.400 --> 01:29:34.280]   ousted, replaced by Dean Bechette.
[01:29:34.280 --> 01:29:35.280]   Okay."
[01:29:35.280 --> 01:29:39.560]   And the best tweet I saw, I forget who I could give credit, was that the news of why will
[01:29:39.560 --> 01:29:44.560]   be available only for New York Times premium platinum users.
[01:29:44.560 --> 01:29:46.560]   That's good.
[01:29:46.560 --> 01:29:48.560]   I like it.
[01:29:48.560 --> 01:29:52.240]   There's also a pretty good widget that remembers what you've read and what you haven't.
[01:29:52.240 --> 01:29:54.960]   You can flip through the stories in the Android widget.
[01:29:54.960 --> 01:29:58.240]   That's the only, I think, main difference between the Android version and the iOS version.
[01:29:58.240 --> 01:30:01.640]   She gives me a good tool that's related.
[01:30:01.640 --> 01:30:04.640]   So that's one, but here's another one.
[01:30:04.640 --> 01:30:10.040]   I always thought that newsstand wasn't just like selling magazines, but it is, in fact,
[01:30:10.040 --> 01:30:11.600]   a news app with a nice widget.
[01:30:11.600 --> 01:30:17.360]   You can scroll through the newsstand stories, even if you don't buy a magazine.
[01:30:17.360 --> 01:30:18.840]   You can see news highlights.
[01:30:18.840 --> 01:30:21.120]   This is the Google Play newsstand.
[01:30:21.120 --> 01:30:28.160]   And I think it actually is a pretty darn nice summary of the news.
[01:30:28.160 --> 01:30:30.640]   Now if you subscribe to magazines, they'll show up here.
[01:30:30.640 --> 01:30:31.640]   I like it too.
[01:30:31.640 --> 01:30:32.640]   I use it every day.
[01:30:32.640 --> 01:30:35.680]   I prefer this to the Yahoo Now.
[01:30:35.680 --> 01:30:37.560]   We just looked at it, frankly.
[01:30:37.560 --> 01:30:42.080]   There's a different use case, and I'm not sure what it is exactly for newsstand versus
[01:30:42.080 --> 01:30:43.080]   flip board.
[01:30:43.080 --> 01:30:45.560]   But here's highlights.
[01:30:45.560 --> 01:30:46.560]   It's like flip board.
[01:30:46.560 --> 01:30:47.560]   Here's news.
[01:30:47.560 --> 01:30:48.560]   It's different.
[01:30:48.560 --> 01:30:52.080]   I think it's business entertainment.
[01:30:52.080 --> 01:30:53.960]   And if you subscribe to a magazine, it'll show up here.
[01:30:53.960 --> 01:30:58.680]   But none of the, I don't actually subscribe to any magazines in newsstand or newspapers.
[01:30:58.680 --> 01:31:01.920]   But I did log into my New York Times account and I subscribed lots.
[01:31:01.920 --> 01:31:02.920]   Yeah.
[01:31:02.920 --> 01:31:03.920]   What's the name of this?
[01:31:03.920 --> 01:31:04.920]   Play recommendation?
[01:31:04.920 --> 01:31:06.440]   No, no, it's old.
[01:31:06.440 --> 01:31:08.040]   So I just thought it was the Play Store.
[01:31:08.040 --> 01:31:09.040]   It was another Play Store.
[01:31:09.040 --> 01:31:10.040]   It's Play Newsstand.
[01:31:10.040 --> 01:31:11.040]   It's a Play Newsstand.
[01:31:11.040 --> 01:31:13.680]   It's a Google News app, but it's not Google News.
[01:31:13.680 --> 01:31:14.680]   Play Newsstand.
[01:31:14.680 --> 01:31:15.680]   Remember that?
[01:31:15.680 --> 01:31:22.600]   So you have, you know, Playbooks, Play Games, Play Movies and TV, Play Music and Play Newsstand.
[01:31:22.600 --> 01:31:27.440]   And I just assumed, because it's lumped in with these, you know, places where you buy
[01:31:27.440 --> 01:31:32.040]   music or you buy movies and TV, that is like Apple's new stand, a place where you buy
[01:31:32.040 --> 01:31:33.560]   and subscribe to them.
[01:31:33.560 --> 01:31:37.280]   But it's actually much better because it's actually a news app.
[01:31:37.280 --> 01:31:40.560]   You know, this reminds me, I've been meaning to complain about something for a long time.
[01:31:40.560 --> 01:31:41.560]   All right.
[01:31:41.560 --> 01:31:42.560]   Complain about it.
[01:31:42.560 --> 01:31:46.240]   So the Google Finance app is awful.
[01:31:46.240 --> 01:31:47.560]   It's like an orphan child.
[01:31:47.560 --> 01:31:48.560]   Here it is.
[01:31:48.560 --> 01:31:49.560]   Yeah.
[01:31:49.560 --> 01:31:52.080]   And when you try to go to, please go ahead.
[01:31:52.080 --> 01:31:56.440]   When you try to go to a story, it gives, it's bad sources.
[01:31:56.440 --> 01:31:58.080]   It constantly has problems updating.
[01:31:58.080 --> 01:32:02.280]   If you go back to the portfolio and then go to Google, let's say, because we're on that.
[01:32:02.280 --> 01:32:03.760]   And then you get news.
[01:32:03.760 --> 01:32:05.520]   But the news is always from weird sources.
[01:32:05.520 --> 01:32:07.960]   It doesn't give you very much good stuff.
[01:32:07.960 --> 01:32:10.400]   Sometimes you try to click through and you get some more from the world.
[01:32:10.400 --> 01:32:12.640]   This is the same kind of news that you get in Yahoo Finance.
[01:32:12.640 --> 01:32:13.800]   This is financial news.
[01:32:13.800 --> 01:32:16.640]   I know, but Google should do a better job of this.
[01:32:16.640 --> 01:32:17.640]   Yeah.
[01:32:17.640 --> 01:32:22.840]   It's very much like the Yahoo app or any other financial app, I think.
[01:32:22.840 --> 01:32:25.560]   Mostly people use that for your stock price, right?
[01:32:25.560 --> 01:32:27.920]   And the only reason you look at, oh, you can have a ticker.
[01:32:27.920 --> 01:32:31.000]   The only reason that you look at news is to say, why did that stock toss?
[01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:32.000]   Yes.
[01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:33.000]   Yes.
[01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:34.000]   So it's that kind of news.
[01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:35.000]   It's got them.
[01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:36.000]   Okay.
[01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:40.880]   And the other thing I don't understand why they don't have it done is there isn't a Google
[01:32:40.880 --> 01:32:43.480]   news app.
[01:32:43.480 --> 01:32:45.520]   Now Google news is made nicely for mobile.
[01:32:45.520 --> 01:32:49.520]   I surprise they even still do Google news.
[01:32:49.520 --> 01:32:50.520]   Do you think?
[01:32:50.520 --> 01:32:51.520]   I mean, really seriously, I'm surprised.
[01:32:51.520 --> 01:32:53.600]   I use got so I that feels like Google Reader.
[01:32:53.600 --> 01:32:55.000]   That feels like another era.
[01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:56.000]   Don't say that.
[01:32:56.000 --> 01:32:57.000]   Another time and place.
[01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:59.200]   I use Google news every week for the show.
[01:32:59.200 --> 01:33:00.200]   I use Google news often.
[01:33:00.200 --> 01:33:01.400]   I go on and see what's to do.
[01:33:01.400 --> 01:33:02.400]   I use news occasionally.
[01:33:02.400 --> 01:33:05.800]   There are times when I get results that are old and I switch over to news.
[01:33:05.800 --> 01:33:09.000]   Don't put Hillary does not have brain damage.
[01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:11.200]   Well remember she got hit on the head.
[01:33:11.200 --> 01:33:14.080]   There were some concern that she was injured.
[01:33:14.080 --> 01:33:15.320]   Why do I have two phones?
[01:33:15.320 --> 01:33:16.320]   Oh, this is Jason's.
[01:33:16.320 --> 01:33:19.440]   This is the one that's much larger.
[01:33:19.440 --> 01:33:20.440]   Yeah.
[01:33:20.440 --> 01:33:21.440]   Well, good.
[01:33:21.440 --> 01:33:22.440]   Thank you, Gina.
[01:33:22.440 --> 01:33:24.680]   You gave me my you gave me my tools.
[01:33:24.680 --> 01:33:26.480]   The Yahoo news.
[01:33:26.480 --> 01:33:33.160]   Yahoo news digest and Google news stand news play news stand, which actually is a very good
[01:33:33.160 --> 01:33:35.520]   and is a great widget and a very good little news app.
[01:33:35.520 --> 01:33:37.680]   Whether you subscribed anything in it or not.
[01:33:37.680 --> 01:33:38.680]   Yeah, thank you.
[01:33:38.680 --> 01:33:39.680]   I just installed the widget.
[01:33:39.680 --> 01:33:40.960]   So the widget wasn't in my widget list.
[01:33:40.960 --> 01:33:43.480]   I had to launch the app and then say, okay, got it.
[01:33:43.480 --> 01:33:46.200]   You know, I'm in and then the widget showed up.
[01:33:46.200 --> 01:33:47.200]   Oh, stop.
[01:33:47.200 --> 01:33:48.200]   I got it now.
[01:33:48.200 --> 01:33:49.200]   It's a nice widget.
[01:33:49.200 --> 01:33:50.200]   Yeah, it's quite pretty.
[01:33:50.200 --> 01:33:51.200]   You can scroll.
[01:33:51.200 --> 01:33:54.720]   It's you know, these are all very well, you want to see it again?
[01:33:54.720 --> 01:33:55.720]   These are all.
[01:33:55.720 --> 01:33:57.480]   Chet shows my hand.
[01:33:57.480 --> 01:33:59.000]   I want to see it.
[01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:03.040]   These are all very much like a flipboard currents.
[01:34:03.040 --> 01:34:06.680]   Remember Google currents, which kind of for a while, the choice.
[01:34:06.680 --> 01:34:07.680]   But I think this is nice.
[01:34:07.680 --> 01:34:08.680]   Doesn't take up a lot of space.
[01:34:08.680 --> 01:34:13.560]   You can just tap the down bar and go through stories like this.
[01:34:13.560 --> 01:34:14.560]   Which one is that?
[01:34:14.560 --> 01:34:16.280]   This is the new stand one.
[01:34:16.280 --> 01:34:17.280]   Plus the new stand widget.
[01:34:17.280 --> 01:34:19.360]   Oh, I have to use a new.
[01:34:19.360 --> 01:34:20.360]   I forget about widgets.
[01:34:20.360 --> 01:34:21.360]   What do I find the widget?
[01:34:21.360 --> 01:34:22.360]   I don't know.
[01:34:22.360 --> 01:34:23.360]   Our show.
[01:34:23.360 --> 01:34:25.360]   Long tap in the home screen.
[01:34:25.360 --> 01:34:27.160]   Here I have my help desk.
[01:34:27.160 --> 01:34:30.200]   Oh, no, Jeff, Google it.
[01:34:30.200 --> 01:34:33.080]   It's a long tap in the home screen.
[01:34:33.080 --> 01:34:34.400]   I have a right to irritate.
[01:34:34.400 --> 01:34:35.600]   Or you can remember that.
[01:34:35.600 --> 01:34:40.200]   Or you can go to your app drawer and tap the widget tab.
[01:34:40.200 --> 01:34:43.040]   And then drag them to your screen.
[01:34:43.040 --> 01:34:50.240]   Our show today, let's come to the end.
[01:34:50.240 --> 01:34:56.160]   It feels like the intelligence is going downhill this way.
[01:34:56.160 --> 01:35:00.560]   Geez, man, you come here and you get to abuse.
[01:35:00.560 --> 01:35:03.040]   It's like smart, dumb, and dumber.
[01:35:03.040 --> 01:35:04.200]   No, I'm just teasing.
[01:35:04.200 --> 01:35:05.200]   I'm just teasing.
[01:35:05.200 --> 01:35:08.920]   Some of us need someone to dumb down the news and summarize it at nine points.
[01:35:08.920 --> 01:35:11.280]   And some of us need help bring widgets on our house.
[01:35:11.280 --> 01:35:12.280]   Wait a minute.
[01:35:12.280 --> 01:35:16.480]   There's a hangouts extension in Chrome.
[01:35:16.480 --> 01:35:20.480]   Are you kidding me?
[01:35:20.480 --> 01:35:21.480]   I'll buy you a lunch.
[01:35:21.480 --> 01:35:26.000]   What do you throw your shoes at them or something?
[01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.200]   Hey, Statler and Waldorf.
[01:35:28.200 --> 01:35:31.760]   Hey, these guys don't know what they're talking about.
[01:35:31.760 --> 01:35:36.560]   I remember you've been, you've been on TV.
[01:35:36.560 --> 01:35:38.560]   Our show is every Wednesday.
[01:35:38.560 --> 01:35:39.560]   Let's go back and that's really good.
[01:35:39.560 --> 01:35:40.560]   You want to do that?
[01:35:40.560 --> 01:35:41.560]   That was fun on the show.
[01:35:41.560 --> 01:35:44.800]   That was gripping.
[01:35:44.800 --> 01:35:45.800]   Whose idea was that?
[01:35:45.800 --> 01:35:46.800]   Brilliant.
[01:35:46.800 --> 01:35:47.800]   Jesus?
[01:35:47.800 --> 01:35:48.800]   Yeah, brilliant.
[01:35:48.800 --> 01:35:50.800]   It was my brilliant idea.
[01:35:50.800 --> 01:35:52.280]   It was my brilliant idea.
[01:35:52.280 --> 01:35:55.680]   That's a game to play by yourself.
[01:35:55.680 --> 01:36:01.080]   You've exhausted everything else in life you can do your last two minutes before you die.
[01:36:01.080 --> 01:36:02.080]   You play that game.
[01:36:02.080 --> 01:36:04.400]   There's not enough time in two minutes.
[01:36:04.400 --> 01:36:07.600]   The idea though is to help you learn to spell English better.
[01:36:07.600 --> 01:36:10.600]   So it's really for non-English speakers.
[01:36:10.600 --> 01:36:19.080]   Let's play another round.
[01:36:19.080 --> 01:36:23.880]   We knew this week in Google every Wednesday afternoon, 1 p.m. Pacific, 4 p.m. Eastern Time
[01:36:23.880 --> 01:36:27.720]   2000 UTC on twit.tv.
[01:36:27.720 --> 01:36:31.640]   If you watch live, you'll see great fun and occasional profanity.
[01:36:31.640 --> 01:36:38.120]   But if you don't, you can get the on-demand version of which we have expunged all profanity
[01:36:38.120 --> 01:36:39.880]   and fun.
[01:36:39.880 --> 01:36:45.640]   And you get that right there in your iTunes or Stitcher or use the great Twit apps or
[01:36:45.640 --> 01:36:47.640]   just go to twit.tv/twig.
[01:36:47.640 --> 01:36:49.400]   Nice to have you.
[01:36:49.400 --> 01:36:50.400]   It's great to be here.
[01:36:50.400 --> 01:36:51.400]   I love being here.
[01:36:51.400 --> 01:36:53.720]   Next time we'll be here, all three of us together.
[01:36:53.720 --> 01:36:54.720]   After I am.
[01:36:54.720 --> 01:36:55.720]   Hi.
[01:36:55.720 --> 01:36:56.720]   Oh.
[01:36:56.720 --> 01:36:57.720]   What day is that?
[01:36:57.720 --> 01:36:58.720]   That's June 25.
[01:36:58.720 --> 01:36:59.720]   End of June.
[01:36:59.720 --> 01:37:00.720]   All right.
[01:37:00.720 --> 01:37:01.720]   That's exciting.
[01:37:01.720 --> 01:37:02.720]   It is.
[01:37:02.720 --> 01:37:06.760]   And we will do live coverage by the way of the I/O keynote and then do this week in Google
[01:37:06.760 --> 01:37:07.760]   right after.
[01:37:07.760 --> 01:37:11.120]   Cheetah Trippani is at ThinkUp.com.
[01:37:11.120 --> 01:37:12.120]   You got to get ThinkUp.
[01:37:12.120 --> 01:37:13.960]   If you haven't got it yet, let me just get some insights.
[01:37:13.960 --> 01:37:14.960]   I like to do this.
[01:37:14.960 --> 01:37:17.360]   I love to do my ThinkUp.
[01:37:17.360 --> 01:37:20.280]   See what how my week was on Twitter.
[01:37:20.280 --> 01:37:29.040]   It takes Twitter and Facebook analyzes it and tells you what happened, who followed you,
[01:37:29.040 --> 01:37:30.440]   which tweets were big.
[01:37:30.440 --> 01:37:31.440]   Wow.
[01:37:31.440 --> 01:37:32.440]   That was a big one.
[01:37:32.440 --> 01:37:37.040]   Oh, Leo, more people follow you than went to Woodstock.
[01:37:37.040 --> 01:37:38.840]   Let's go down.
[01:37:38.840 --> 01:37:39.840]   Wow.
[01:37:39.840 --> 01:37:42.640]   That chart is a bug.
[01:37:42.640 --> 01:37:43.640]   That's a big bug.
[01:37:43.640 --> 01:37:44.880]   We got to fix that.
[01:37:44.880 --> 01:37:45.880]   That's not right.
[01:37:45.880 --> 01:37:47.280]   Sorry about that.
[01:37:47.280 --> 01:37:49.040]   That's not right.
[01:37:49.040 --> 01:37:52.800]   This status update got quadruple the likes for Leo Laport.
[01:37:52.800 --> 01:37:53.800]   That is also a bug.
[01:37:53.800 --> 01:37:54.800]   We're in beta.
[01:37:54.800 --> 01:37:55.800]   That status update.
[01:37:55.800 --> 01:37:57.800]   Ooh, this is incredible.
[01:37:57.800 --> 01:37:58.800]   There we go.
[01:37:58.800 --> 01:37:59.800]   That is great.
[01:37:59.800 --> 01:38:08.640]   Did you do that just for me, Gina?
[01:38:08.640 --> 01:38:09.640]   Absolutely.
[01:38:09.640 --> 01:38:10.840]   That is so awesome.
[01:38:10.840 --> 01:38:12.640]   Is that Maharishi, Mahesh Yogi?
[01:38:12.640 --> 01:38:14.640]   I don't think that's Woodstock.
[01:38:14.640 --> 01:38:16.400]   I think that's some else.
[01:38:16.400 --> 01:38:17.840]   Or R.Cultly, or Leo.
[01:38:17.840 --> 01:38:18.840]   What is that?
[01:38:18.840 --> 01:38:20.840]   Is it Woodstock?
[01:38:20.840 --> 01:38:21.840]   Yeah.
[01:38:21.840 --> 01:38:24.520]   That's how many people went to Woodstock.
[01:38:24.520 --> 01:38:26.600]   More than half a million people follow the O Laport.
[01:38:26.600 --> 01:38:30.480]   But the difference is at Woodstock there were no spam bots.
[01:38:30.480 --> 01:38:31.480]   So that's a big difference.
[01:38:31.480 --> 01:38:32.480]   True.
[01:38:32.480 --> 01:38:33.480]   That is true.
[01:38:33.480 --> 01:38:34.480]   Good point.
[01:38:34.480 --> 01:38:35.480]   This is a really useful tool.
[01:38:35.480 --> 01:38:37.320]   I really like it.
[01:38:37.320 --> 01:38:42.840]   My updates from last week got the best response between 9am and 10am.
[01:38:42.840 --> 01:38:45.480]   That's when I should be tweeting.
[01:38:45.480 --> 01:38:47.480]   That's just a little thing that's useful.
[01:38:47.480 --> 01:38:48.480]   Yeah.
[01:38:48.480 --> 01:38:49.480]   Thanks, Leo.
[01:38:49.480 --> 01:38:50.480]   Thank you, Gina.
[01:38:50.480 --> 01:38:51.480]   We'll fix that chart.
[01:38:51.480 --> 01:38:54.160]   Thank you so much for having me on the show.
[01:38:54.160 --> 01:38:56.440]   My favorite hour of the week.
[01:38:56.440 --> 01:38:57.440]   Same here.
[01:38:57.440 --> 01:39:00.040]   Right after all about Android, which is another favorite hour of the week, which she does
[01:39:00.040 --> 01:39:03.160]   every Tuesday on this network, 5 p.m. Pacific.
[01:39:03.160 --> 01:39:06.800]   Jeff Jarvis is at Buzzmachine.com, City University of New York.
[01:39:06.800 --> 01:39:08.960]   If you want to study journalism, this is the guy to learn from.
[01:39:08.960 --> 01:39:12.640]   He's reading a book on the history of newspapers.
[01:39:12.640 --> 01:39:13.640]   How about that?
[01:39:13.640 --> 01:39:18.320]   Wake me when it's over.
[01:39:18.320 --> 01:39:21.800]   It's my homework.
[01:39:21.800 --> 01:39:26.080]   He also published a couple of fabulous books, but the most recent is Public Parts, which
[01:39:26.080 --> 01:39:27.760]   you can get bookstores everywhere.
[01:39:27.760 --> 01:39:28.760]   Thank you, Jeff.
