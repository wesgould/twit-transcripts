[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.240]   It's time for Twig this week in Google. Stacey and Anne have the week off, but we've got a great
[00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:12.680]   villain team. Kathy Gellis is here and for the first time ever, I can't believe it Glenn Fleischman, Jeff Jarvis.
[00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.680]   Of course, what are we gonna talk about?
[00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:20.840]   Elon Musk and Twitter. We'll talk about Google's quarterly results. They were a disappointment to Wall Street,
[00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.080]   but should Google be fretting and a little bit of typesetting
[00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.080]   and nerdery. It's all coming up next on Twig.

[00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:49.360]   It's time for Twig this week in Google, which this week will not be about Google in any way,
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.880]   shape or form. As you might imagine, there is another topic on the table. Now,
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:02.560]   Ant Pruitt is out for the week. He's going to watch his kids at a track meet. Stacey is under the weather,
[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.280]   so we have some special guests and we're thrilled about it. But first let me introduce one of our
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.600]   stalwarts guy who's been here since day one. Mr. Jeff Jarvis. I show up. I just want to know
[00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.880]   that I show up. He wants to get rid of me, but he can't. I can't. I keep trying. I'm always on this
[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:25.280]   podcast. He is the Leonard Taill professor for journalistic innovation at the Crane. New Mark.
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:32.080]   Graduates. Oh, I do want that. That wasn't a new one. Let's do that again. That was pretty. Yeah.
[00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:41.360]   Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York. If you were a billionaire,
[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.760]   you could have your name sung as well. Thank you very much for being here. Now, let's introduce
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:51.840]   the rest of our panel. I feel like it's a game show. Let's meet the rest of our panel.
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.960]   Kathy Gellis is here. She's been here before. She's an author at Tech Dirt and of course,
[00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:03.040]   specializes in cyber law at CGcounsel.com. Hi, Kathy. Thank you for joining us in short notice.
[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.680]   We appreciate it. Thanks for having me. So nice to have you. And even shorter.
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:14.480]   Even shorter. No. My Fleishman is also here. Glenn.Fun. I love that Glenn.
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:20.800]   Easy to spell URL as opposed to my previous hard to spell ones. Yeah, I was just sitting.
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.240]   I'm always ready to go online. Apparently. And I just fired up the microphone. I could tell
[00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:28.960]   you have a real microphone. You get the headphones. You're set. You, of course, have heard him on
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:35.040]   the incomparable. He's been a longtime writer for Macworld and a man about town. And I think
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:40.080]   it's nice because I wanted, I know we're going to be talking about Twitter, but I'd like to get a
[00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:45.520]   variety of viewpoints on here. I did ask and he couldn't do it. I wish he could Siva,
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:52.000]   Vaajanathan because Siva, who is also a professor of journalism, but across town,
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.920]   wrote a piece in Salon, or sorry, slate called there's no reason or sorry, there is a reason.
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:04.480]   No smart buyer has, let's see, there's no reason a smart buyer has not purchased Twitter.
[00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:10.640]   There's there's a reason no smart by it's too many negatives. Anyway, there's a reason no one's
[00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:16.480]   bought Twitter so far. He says Elon Musk is going to lose his shirt. The first thing I want to say
[00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:21.760]   before we get into this heavy conversation, obviously, you know the news. Elon Musk succeeded.
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:29.120]   We're all else have failed in buying Twitter for 44 billion dollars. Most of it borrowed
[00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:35.680]   against Tesla stock, which immediately caused him to lose a significant amount of its personal
[00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.400]   fortune when Tesla stock plummeted in value 100 billion dollars because the market said,
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:48.560]   oh, he's going to screw this one up. He will not take over Twitter for until regulatory approval,
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:53.040]   about six months. Of course, there's a lot going on. There's a one billion dollar
[00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:59.520]   kill fee if either Elon or Twitter backs out of the deal, a significant, I think, penalty.
[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:05.120]   And of course, there are a lot of questions about what Elon is going to do with Twitter.
[00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:09.920]   There are a number of people, some of them very high profile, who have run screaming from the
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:18.480]   building. There are a number of others like me who just say, well, let's see, but I think there's
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:24.160]   legitimate cause for concern. One cause for concern, Kathy, is right up your alley, which is the privacy
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:28.720]   cause for concern. Elon suddenly owns outright. He's taking it private.
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:33.040]   Everything that Twitter knows about you and me and everybody else on Twitter.
[00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:40.240]   Yeah. To some extent, that is kind of the setup of how we do our platforms, that in theory,
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:47.120]   somebody owns stuff. But it didn't feel quite as objectionable when it was either owned
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:53.360]   by a private entity that you chose to do business with anyway, or then a public entity that's
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:59.040]   still subject to certain forms of regulatory rules about what they can or can't do. This feels
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:04.400]   weird. It's kind of the worst case scenario where you give a lot of information to somebody,
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:09.360]   you read their privacy policy, you say, well, that's okay. It's publicly held. They have to
[00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:16.000]   they can't lie. Okay, I'm going to trust them. And then they sell it. And every all bets are off,
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.480]   right? There's no agreement. There's no privacy agreement between us and Twitter anymore. So
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:25.440]   whatever Elon wants to do. Well, I thought different things would get sold. Like, I always
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:30.560]   understand that when companies write their privacy policies, they do sort of tend to put, we may sell
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:35.360]   it. And but I've always thought of it in terms of sort of end-glaining of data that they've learned
[00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:40.080]   about people that they will potentially give to vendors or something like that. And a lot of
[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:44.320]   people object to that there are concerns. But that seemed like the normal vector of where I'd
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:50.400]   expect the privacy to go. This is a little bit different because this is he can in theory see
[00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:54.560]   our direct well, not yet. This hasn't happened. But if he all of a sudden steps into the ownership
[00:06:54.560 --> 00:07:00.400]   shoes, he can see all the direct the direct messages that aren't encrypted. He has all the
[00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:05.200]   information that otherwise governments try to subpoena or private parties try to subpoena.
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:08.560]   In theory, that's all available to him. And this is a huge problem for
[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:14.160]   Twitter has been very aggressive in litigating the privacy of autonomous speakers.
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:18.640]   And all of a sudden, there's a gigantic vector of people they were hiding from now own
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:24.800]   the information that would tell them who they are. And that's weird and weird in a really terrible,
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:32.560]   scary way. There's also the issue of what Elon has said he will do with Twitter.
[00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:41.920]   And your colleague at Techter Mike Masnick wrote that his statements to Chris Anderson at the
[00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:48.640]   Ted talk last week demonstrated a complete lack of understanding what the First Amendment meant,
[00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:56.560]   what the algorithm meant. The whole thing is basically a mass of ignorance. Before I get to
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:01.680]   Jeff, because I know Jeff, I think you're the one with his hair on fire, but we'll check.
[00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:06.640]   I want to ask Glenn, because we I don't know what you have unlike everybody else, not
[00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:12.160]   posted a thousand articles on this. What is your opinion of the future Twitter going forward under
[00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:19.760]   an Elon Musk? I just think it's a potentially devastating move because I don't think his interests
[00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:25.200]   align with the majority of people use the platform. I don't think Twitter really knows what it is.
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:31.040]   I mean, what is Twitter? It's got its build as a microblogging service, which is a term that
[00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:36.160]   means almost nothing because there's kind of only one microbogging service that people use to
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:40.160]   in any large amount. There are some far right ones that have gotten a little bit of traction,
[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:46.080]   but not a lot compared to it. So it's this unique entity. It stands in opposition or distinct from
[00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:53.680]   Facebook. It has they haven't quite ever figured out what to do that's not just this very narrow
[00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:59.680]   set of options. I love constraints. So I think it's done very well with that, but they don't
[00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:03.920]   effectively moderate the platform, even though they've put in a lot more safeguards and a lot more,
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:10.160]   they've made a lot more attempts to make it fair and they're fairer for people, less abusive,
[00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:16.400]   and to label political content and try to keep the commons a little clearer. But it's a very
[00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:21.840]   complicated operation with a single line of revenue, essentially, from advertising. Musk says he
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:25.360]   doesn't care about the business basics, but then he's structured a deal that's going to put him on
[00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:31.120]   the hook for a lot of personal interest payments and Twitter leveraged for payments it's going to
[00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:36.560]   have to make. So it can't just turn off the I mean, he could turn off the revenue pipe or
[00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:41.840]   advertisers could flee if it's ruined and it's not a good place to put your ads for cars and credit
[00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:46.560]   cards and square space and whoever else up on it. But then he's got to take money from his personal
[00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:53.200]   fortune to cover that. So I don't think he knows what he wants to do with it because the statements
[00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:58.240]   are both big and contradictory, which is the best kind, right? I was, you know, I mean all last week,
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:04.240]   I was saying, Oh, Elon doesn't want to buy Twitter. This is this is Elon trolling. Elon's not that
[00:10:04.240 --> 00:10:09.680]   crazy. The last thing he ever wanted to do this effect, this could well be just pump and dump. He
[00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:14.640]   wants the price to go up so he can make a billion dollars on his investment, things like that.
[00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:23.200]   I was so wrong. Elon told Chris Anderson, and this was before he got Twitter, but after he offered
[00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:28.800]   to buy it, I think it's really important for there to be an include quoting him now an inclusive arena
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:35.680]   for free speech. Twitter has become the de facto town square. So that's how he sees it. So it's
[00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:40.080]   really important that people have both the reality and perception. They're able to speak freely within
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:45.280]   the bounds of the law. Then he says, as Mike Masnick points out something completely contradictory,
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:52.240]   which is as long as it doesn't break the law, it's free speech, but no spam, which is protected by
[00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:58.160]   law as for speech. And people have brought up the fact that the instant any service is unmoderated in
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:04.000]   the modern age, the immediate, it's a chance. It's you get CSAM, you get child sexualized. You get
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:09.600]   four chain and eight, Chad. You get garbage. No advertiser want and no user would want. You have to
[00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:14.160]   filter out spam, you have to filter out child pornography, and you have to filter out revenge
[00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:18.400]   poor, you have to filter out huge quantities of things have to be actively moderated,
[00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:22.560]   just as a starting point. So you don't violate the law in most countries on the planet.
[00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:29.440]   He also says he wants to open the algorithm. It's funny. The stuff he said,
[00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:34.240]   when I on first reading, I'm going, yeah, yeah, free speech, yeah, open the algorithm. Yeah. But
[00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:38.800]   then after you just consider for a second, or you realize, well, you open the algorithm,
[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:43.360]   who takes advantage of that? Spammers, they game the system. They know how to get something at the
[00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:48.640]   top of the list. Great. You've done. This is exactly why Google does not open its algorithm,
[00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:54.000]   because otherwise it gets game like crazy. That's a very risky thing to do.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:59.520]   Maznick's point, which I think is very well taken, is that Elon saying a lot of things
[00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:06.480]   that the original founders of Twitter in all of Silicon Valley espoused 15, 20 years ago,
[00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:12.880]   but have learned the hard way doesn't work. And so they've learned that to make a good space,
[00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:19.840]   you have to moderate, you have to have rules. And he, Maznick saying, Elon's just going to throw out
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:28.640]   15 years of learning, 15 years of hard one moderation and start from scratch without any real
[00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:34.160]   plan for what to do. All right. I've been, I've been really doing this to drive you crazy, Jeff.
[00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:40.160]   You know, and you've been really good about not saying anything. Jeff Jarvis, what do you think?
[00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:46.400]   I have, I don't know what I think. I think it's wrong to guess what he's going to do, because we
[00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:50.960]   don't know, because he doesn't know what he's going to do. That's obvious. Although, you might say
[00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:56.720]   that that's potentially problematic. He spent $44 billion on something. You know what you're going
[00:12:56.720 --> 00:13:02.240]   to do. I know what his people do. He found it in the couch cushions. It's fine. I'm going to buy
[00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:06.160]   this ice cream coat. I don't know what I'm going to do with it. We'll cross that bridge when it
[00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:10.560]   comes when we come to it. So I mean, I saw that I saw what Twitter is going to be like last week
[00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:15.680]   when I put up my tweet and for 36 hours until they got bored with me and went after, you know,
[00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:21.760]   table of the rents or somebody else, the muscobytes came after me. He has his own army of bots,
[00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:28.160]   human or not, absolutely, all their bots with heartbeats. Yeah. And so it was Andrew Sullivan
[00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:33.920]   and Glenn Greenwald and Fox News, and they all came after me and they they they thick their clever,
[00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:37.840]   but they're not. And so it's the same thing over and over and over and over and over again.
[00:13:38.400 --> 00:13:45.280]   And then they and then squirrel, they go away and they go the next thing. So I think I'm trying to
[00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:49.440]   look at this as a business story first. I care more about the speech. I care more what's going to
[00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:54.720]   happen, but I'm just trying to get my head around that in a few ways. One, the interest rates
[00:13:54.720 --> 00:14:00.960]   have to be awful. This is a leveraged buyout. $44 billion. The cash flow is not that great.
[00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:06.800]   It's leveraged against Tesla stock, which is volatile. Twitter is not a great venture to start
[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:11.840]   off with. So I've got to believe that he won't be screaming about free speech. He'll be screaming
[00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:17.840]   about free cash flow to his managers. I wonder plus one what Jeff is saying. This is absolutely
[00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:25.040]   a corporate law story. It's where the interest is. The release of the merger deal is where the
[00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:30.720]   really interesting stuff is like this is one of the things that's been a problem, and I'm sorry,
[00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:35.840]   I cut you off Jeff is in this whole space about online speech. We've been just paying all this
[00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:41.120]   attention, oversized attention to free speech, section 230, blah, blah, blah, and ignoring
[00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:47.120]   everything else that happens to shape the space, including corporate law has been a gigantic voice
[00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:52.720]   that shapes things because why is it that companies act the way they do that matters? We have whole
[00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:57.600]   bodies of law that force companies to act in certain ways or give them certain liberties or
[00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:02.640]   take away their discretion. We create incentives and then we wonder why companies act consistent
[00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:07.840]   with those incentives. You're absolutely right that this is the story. It's always been the story,
[00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:13.680]   but it's getting ignored. We never get the analysis of it. So Kathy, beyond that, beyond the law
[00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:17.760]   piece, which I absolutely agree with, that's the smart way you would look at it as I would expect,
[00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:21.920]   there's also just the business part of Musk. And I've been thinking that through, I got into it
[00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:28.480]   with O'Malley in Twitter where he was, I don't know, he was defending Musk's business intelligence.
[00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:34.800]   And it made me think and I thought, okay, so fine, Tesla, World's Richest Man would seem on its face
[00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:40.880]   that he's the most brilliant businessman we have. But Leo, you used to own a Tesla and now you own
[00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:46.160]   a Mustang and every single car company out there is going to make alternatives, is making alternatives
[00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:53.600]   to Tesla. I don't think that's a growth stock. One, two, SpaceX, fine, he can make some money,
[00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:58.320]   shuttling back Russians and whoever it is, but that's not a huge business. Three, nobody once
[00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:04.400]   holds in the ground, sorry, for whatever happened to Hyperloop, but I've started a link, okay, but
[00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:10.560]   the government is what gave him money for Ukraine. He's trying to take credit. I don't know that he's
[00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:15.920]   so brilliant at this, but I think he is smart enough to know this. And this is what he's so in
[00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:20.880]   all his own. This is what he's going to have the most funny could possibly have. And he's
[00:16:20.880 --> 00:16:27.360]   responsible to know one and he's doing what he's doing. But it's disturbing because I was talking
[00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:33.200]   to a reporter today from the Christian Science Monitor and I said, people built their communities
[00:16:33.200 --> 00:16:38.080]   here. So I quote on the show often, Andre Brock Jr., who wrote Distributed Blackness. And his
[00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:42.800]   spirit is, you're not kicking me off of here. We work to make this place, we're making this ours.
[00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:48.240]   And Charlotte Klimer, who's a brilliant ex-evangelical trans activist on Twitter,
[00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:54.160]   and she said the same thing. And so what happened here was that Musk can buy the company,
[00:16:54.160 --> 00:17:01.040]   but he can't buy the communities. He can try to screw it up. But it's kind of past him now.
[00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:04.880]   And I don't know what he's really going to get out of it in the end, except a bunch of attention,
[00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:09.520]   a bunch of fun, a bunch of trolling. He's going to get bored. And then it could be sold for pieces
[00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:16.800]   private equity or something else. And it's just not a happy place. All of this is to say that I wish,
[00:17:16.800 --> 00:17:22.000]   and I see Dorsey kind of sucking up to Musk. And I think it could be because it got along,
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.360]   that's fine. But I also think it's because Jack wants blue sky to happen, and he doesn't want
[00:17:25.360 --> 00:17:31.920]   to mess that up, because that is the only answer I see going forward is speech as protocol, which is
[00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:42.320]   what original investor in Twitter, Fred Wilson, has been talking about alongside Jack. And then
[00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:48.960]   we build value added layers on top of that, like wordpress.org.com on top of.org. So I hope
[00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:53.920]   there's a functionality to go before. I looked at Mastodon and there's nothing there.
[00:17:53.920 --> 00:18:00.480]   I don't know where else we go. So I think we fight for where we are. Hope we survive this era,
[00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:04.400]   and then rebuild from there and build something better in the future.
[00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:08.720]   So I don't think you needed me on the show because I just agree with everything that Jeff
[00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:16.480]   said. So I think that's the right analysis. One thing I'm missing from the reporting is
[00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:21.840]   timescale, because I mean, the headlines were all kind of like as of Monday he owned it.
[00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:26.640]   And even I was like falling for that. I'm like, oh my gosh, this was so quick. And then like,
[00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:31.040]   I got my corporate law hat on and stuff and started thinking about like, no, it can't possibly be
[00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:36.480]   like that. And so the headlines were bad. And I think the reporting, I'd actually like to see
[00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:40.640]   some good reporting and maybe it's out there and I haven't seen it. But what is the timescale? What
[00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:44.560]   are the things that need to happen? Because I know some of this. There's going to be due diligence.
[00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:49.440]   Meanwhile, there's a non disparagement clause that must appears to be violating like every five
[00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:52.560]   minutes. I don't want to interrupt you, but there is going to be no due diligence. Actually,
[00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:58.640]   he waved. They basically waved due diligence, which is like, there's rats in the wall. And
[00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:04.160]   you're like, that's fine. Yeah. So but they so it means that won't but they'll be the shareholder
[00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:10.720]   vote. There's there's also regulatory. Kathy, isn't there? So who is this?
[00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:17.200]   This is FTC has to this is FTC. Does the FCC way in on this? I don't see see what
[00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:23.120]   is the SEC by the way, Elon did lose a court case today. The judge ruled that he lose it. Yeah.
[00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:27.920]   Yeah. The judge ruled that no, the SEC is right. You were not coerced in this agreement.
[00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:32.400]   And this is going to be interesting. Elon Musk, when he owns Twitter, will still have to
[00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:41.040]   according to the SEC get lawyers to approve every tweet. So I think the bottom line is it isn't
[00:19:41.040 --> 00:19:45.520]   supposed to work this way. And a question I have, I'd like to see more analysis on,
[00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:54.400]   is, is did we not have law that adequately anticipated this? Or do we have law that did sort of
[00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:59.120]   anticipate this that isn't executing? Like he is I mean, there's at least little scoff laws that
[00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:04.400]   he's ended up with, you know, him buying the 10% and not filing the form on time.
[00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:08.560]   So there's a number of things that he that there was law that technically existed that
[00:20:08.560 --> 00:20:13.600]   didn't seem to be a barrier or both of some form. And the problem is, is I think the people who
[00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:18.640]   understand this have not been at our discussion table for a while. And I'm really annoyed. I
[00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:22.320]   have to dig up my notes for my corporate law class because I thought I was done with all that.
[00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:28.560]   But I think that's where the story is because now we're talking about the questions just gone to.
[00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:33.200]   Is this an anti competitive problem? I feel like the answer is yes, because
[00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:39.280]   we only had a couple major platforms and he came with his billions of dollars and instead of
[00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:45.440]   investing in another one, he consumed one that already existed and in a way that's likely to
[00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:51.120]   be deleterious to its further existence. So the, and the question is how legal is that? But that's
[00:20:51.120 --> 00:20:55.120]   not the way that when they've been talking about big tech regulation and breakup big tech.
[00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:58.480]   This wasn't the vector of attack that they were anticipating. This is, Lena Kahn has not written a
[00:20:58.480 --> 00:21:04.080]   paper on what happens when a oligarch buys Twitter. Right. And this is a bigger problem than the
[00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:08.720]   mergers, I think. Yeah. Well, I want to bring up the China situation too, which is that
[00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:13.120]   Milan musk is heavily beholden to China. And you know, I never want to sound like a
[00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:18.080]   some kind of either Chinese conspiracy conspiracy theorist or anti Chinese because you know,
[00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:22.400]   it's caught China's too complicated to summarize in like, you know, a sentence, right? There's no,
[00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:28.240]   so you need several books or a lifetime. But, but we know, we know what China requires of
[00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:35.040]   companies that do business in there. We know how they don't operate by democratic norms or
[00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:39.040]   business norms when they think something has to happen. They'll arrest the richest person in the
[00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:43.600]   country. They'll shut things down. They'll take the most popular actress off the streets and
[00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:47.920]   disappear her for months and so forth. So there's no question that China will do whatever is in
[00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:53.360]   China's interests. And because musk is so beholden for manufacturing and other issues in China,
[00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:57.840]   Chinese that you know, even though Twitter isn't technically allowed in China, what will the
[00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:03.120]   effect be given that Chinese diplomats on Twitter are marked as being associated with the Chinese
[00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:10.720]   government can be subject to suppression and so forth or fact checking. I have huge concerns that
[00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:16.800]   his that there's, you know, Facebook isn't beholden to China. Apple is in a lot of ways and in musk
[00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:23.920]   is there is a great piece by Pete Sweeney and Reuters breaking views. Elon Musk buys Tesla
[00:22:23.920 --> 00:22:31.520]   a pounding Chinese headache. And this is this is going to be a really interesting
[00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:42.720]   clash because yeah, I don't know. I mean, Elon wants to, Elon's building Teslas in China.
[00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:47.440]   Elon wants to stay on the on the best side of the Chinese Communist Party.
[00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:54.720]   Well, it's not just China. It's it's going to be countries around the world. Yeah, you have
[00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:58.640]   Europe coming after them already saying, Whoa, you think you're not going to moderate anything?
[00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:04.000]   No, we got laws over here. We got net's DG. We got all this stuff. You're going to be doing that.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.880]   And then today he right before airtime, he he lawns latest.
[00:23:08.240 --> 00:23:14.080]   W and Dumber tweet was I quote for Twitter to deserve public trust. It must be politically
[00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:18.400]   neutral, which effectively means upsetting the far right and the far left equally in the US.
[00:23:18.400 --> 00:23:22.400]   That might make sense. I would say that but then see the global country.
[00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:26.000]   Even what's political neutral in Mexico in New York,
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:30.640]   where in Sri Lanka have funny, Elon, it's a big, weird, mean world out there. Your simplistic
[00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:37.440]   vision is in for a wild time. Also Kevin Marks says, upsetness is not a metric to run a company on
[00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:45.120]   it's also not something you want to incentivize. Yeah, so let's upset everybody. That's that's
[00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:50.800]   my biggest fear because I like I think everybody on this panel think Twitter has some value,
[00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:55.280]   maybe less than most, but I do think it does have some value. And I don't see any way that
[00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:59.840]   Elon makes Twitter better in any respect. Good point. Good point. Well said. No, it would be
[00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:03.680]   great if he would, but I'm viewing Twitter right now as if it's like Russia after the Ukrainian
[00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:06.880]   invasion is people are wondering how quickly they can get out of the company.
[00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:15.040]   Well, I have to say we have a 362% spike on our Mastodon instance, not like 100 people or anything,
[00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:22.160]   but it's still it's still there are today approved 20. I think 29 new members that twit that social
[00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:27.200]   because we have you know, we this is the login, but we do have our own Mastodon instance, which I
[00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:34.560]   will now walk into. And apparently not on this machine. So I have a whole this whole story is
[00:24:34.560 --> 00:24:42.080]   engendering me with a lot of on way because for a couple reasons. One is that we just discussed,
[00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:47.440]   like Musk is wandering into an area where he's acting like at last somebody is here to do the
[00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:51.840]   big thinking that has been neglected all this time. And it's I'm sorry. No, these issues are a
[00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:56.480]   lot more complex and and and hard and a lot of really good decent talented smart people have
[00:24:56.480 --> 00:25:01.200]   been thinking about them for quite some time. But quite frankly, his nonsense is very similar to
[00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:05.920]   regulatory nonsense if they walk in and say at last a big figure is here to solve all the problems
[00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:10.080]   and say no, the reason the problems weren't getting solved is partly because they're rather
[00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:14.160]   difficult and intractable and partly because idiots keep showing up and pretending that that
[00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:19.360]   less they are the expert who is coming to the room to solve all the problems. So it is so this
[00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:23.840]   is almost boring to me because it's kind of the same old same old and it's like I don't really
[00:25:23.840 --> 00:25:28.800]   like him or anything he promises to do, but it's I see regulations coming out of Congress that are
[00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:34.080]   like almost equally as violent and equally ill rooted in any sort of reality. They're gonna get
[00:25:34.080 --> 00:25:37.040]   worse the regulations gonna get worse because of this kind of crap.
[00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:44.080]   So I am hoping I want to be mostly so I can get up every morning. I want to be more optimistic
[00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:51.280]   about this and see this as a chance for opportunity. And I think it does present a few. I think
[00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:55.760]   you know one of the things rhetorically that kind of makes it interesting is there's been a lot of
[00:25:55.760 --> 00:26:01.360]   difficulty in people understanding how platform moderation is really a First Amendment protected
[00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:06.320]   activity because people don't recognize it when that editorial discretion is in the hands of a
[00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:11.920]   company particularly a platform company. But it's easier to see when it's an individual because
[00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:17.040]   you can see it for yourself like what are the comments you allow on your Facebook post? Obviously,
[00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:21.040]   you know if somebody insults your kid and calls them ugly you're gonna like delete that
[00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:24.160]   and people would understand intuitively that of course you have the First Amendment right to make
[00:26:24.160 --> 00:26:28.800]   that decision. So we tend to see those decisions as First Amendment protected when they're
[00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:33.440]   manifest in the individual and lose sight of them when they're in the company. So I'm kind of hoping
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:38.160]   rhetorically to point out that okay now it's back in the hands of the individual. This is all on
[00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:44.000]   Musk. You can see how he's making these choices and hopefully that maybe we can see how he would
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:48.080]   have the right to make the decisions even though he's going to make them really badly because he's
[00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:54.960]   rejecting all this prior knowledge. So I don't know and then I don't know. I just
[00:26:54.960 --> 00:27:02.640]   want new Twitter. I want all the good people and all the good money to flee immediately and go
[00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:06.320]   start something new and better and leave him to this floundering thing and I want that to happen
[00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:11.440]   as soon as possible except I am also really intrigued and back to the corporate law thing.
[00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:16.880]   I want to understand this dynamic better because I want to understand how likely it is and on what
[00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:22.480]   time scale that this transaction actually closes and what will let's get the popcorn because I don't
[00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:27.040]   know if it's quite as much of a slam dunk as it's being reported but I don't have the knowledge to
[00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:31.920]   point that out. What are the times that you'll close this? The time well I was going to ask
[00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:36.720]   Kathy that the time frame I've seen quoted is six months. I think that was the New York Times.
[00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:44.160]   Do you think why wouldn't it close? He doesn't own any competing social networks.
[00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:48.400]   I won't understand that a little bit better. Oh and Glenn may actually have some answers.
[00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:55.920]   Well I don't know. I have things I can make up. I've studied Twitter. We don't need your hot
[00:27:55.920 --> 00:28:01.840]   take here. So let me give you a cooler take. I imagine many people listening to this and on this
[00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:06.720]   panel Reed Matt Levine who is at Bloomberg who has a great free newsletter and he's great because he
[00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:10.560]   does all the hard work for you right and when you pick apart the deal and also I've been following
[00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:15.200]   people on Twitter who have picked apart the deals term and what the agreement was that was signed
[00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:23.360]   and he's both highly leveraged and not so much but I see a scenario in which if Tesla shareholders
[00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:26.960]   well you know a there's a weird thing which is the major shareholders of Tesla if you look at
[00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:32.560]   the 10 biggest ones there is a strong overlap with the top 10 shareholders of Twitter. It includes
[00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:37.840]   like Fidelity and Blackstone and Vanguard most of which they're holding this in mutual funds and
[00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:43.520]   index funds and so forth but still it's kind of weird that the two companies share so many
[00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:48.560]   major shareholders and that the board clearly solicited their opinion before they went ahead.
[00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:53.520]   So these major shareholders who then now own steaks in Tesla that dropped a significant amount
[00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:58.240]   because the market as a whole responded so negatively. So one thing that could happen is that Tesla
[00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:02.640]   could keep getting hit they could have some you know they've been doing incredibly well we saw the
[00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:07.440]   earnings just was that this week right they've done incredibly well they've executed extremely
[00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:12.800]   well there's lots of complaints about the cars that get circulation but if they have a bad quarter
[00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:17.680]   in the next two quarters or the stock continues to fall because people don't have the trust in it
[00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:23.520]   and suddenly he's already got personal guarantees against chunks of his Tesla stock he'd have to
[00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:28.960]   exercise options the banks could require higher higher margins he's putting up 20 something billion
[00:29:28.960 --> 00:29:33.360]   dollars of his you know quote-unquote own money like cash but he may syndicate some of that and
[00:29:33.360 --> 00:29:37.200]   there's some big questions about yeah where that cash comes from yeah yeah
[00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:41.040]   and so he's and he's guaranteed the way the deal was signed because there's no due diligence so
[00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:45.200]   it's very few conditions apparently under which he can back out with that I mean to pay that was
[00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:50.880]   about a billion dollars right so I've got Matt Levine's column here and by the way his lead is
[00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:57.920]   I guess it's worth saying Elon Musk does not own twitter he did not buy twitter he did sign an
[00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:03.520]   agreement to buy twitter that's a big step and he probably probably he says will own it and some
[00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:10.480]   amount of time maybe six months here is the timeline that he he talks about and I think
[00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:15.680]   Levine probably knows better or as well as anybody what's going to happen he's been covering this
[00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:20.160]   so closely yeah too because it's a great intersection you have a company with you know with reasonable
[00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:24.640]   value although not you know twitter's valuation we're talking a lot about a company worth under
[00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:29.280]   50 billion dollars or value that that now where there are multi-trillion dollar companies in the
[00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:35.600]   world right now and twitter somehow manages because media people like us are so interested in it and
[00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:40.400]   because it's been all talking about it yeah and it's you know there's companies that are was
[00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:45.360]   it I can't do the math 400 times larger that probably get less attention Microsoft is very
[00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:49.840]   boring compared to twitter well for instance I guess at some point we might spend a minute or two on
[00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:56.400]   Google's quarterly report which came out yesterday this is this week in Google and what are we talking
[00:30:56.400 --> 00:31:02.320]   about twitter occupies the imagination so here's the Levine timeline twitter most notably twitter
[00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:06.240]   shareholders will have to vote on the deal twitter will have to write a proxy statement
[00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:12.560]   explaining the deal run it by the SEC send it to shareholders give them some time to read it before
[00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:18.080]   voting that alone those things may take months then there are regulatory approvals that they
[00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:24.080]   have to get before closing the deal when the deal closes he'll have to have the money you know have
[00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:29.040]   to be able to write it right at check right he doesn't just because he's got those agreements
[00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:36.000]   doesn't mean he has the money yeah okay so and and and as Kathy pointed out come along at any
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:41.200]   point in this process and put in a hundred percent so yeah yeah absolutely yeah and I think they had
[00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:46.720]   I said why would anybody as Siva says yeah twitter has been available for some time
[00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:53.360]   well you were Microsoft would you buy it right now would you know for the very reasons we're
[00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:58.720]   talking about I don't think if I were a sensible institutional investor I know well I don't want
[00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:03.120]   to completely throw twitter completely under bus because I think there is value there but nobody
[00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:07.680]   has figured out how to make nobody's figure out how to make money on twitter but but I think the
[00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:13.760]   people is like you know the next olive garc billionaire who is bored and wants to go toe to toe with
[00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:18.480]   the lawn musk I mean I could easily see a play there and there were like weird tweets from Jeff Bezos
[00:32:18.480 --> 00:32:23.600]   what about Bezos like the white knight who writes it he says you know what I can't let this happen
[00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:28.000]   I'm just going to lay out some of my own cash and he's been a good Washington post-owner
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:46.480]   excellent Washington Post-
[00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:52.320]   will be the quote background of the merger section describing the history of the
[00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:59.360]   negotiation took out his doobie and then probably some mention will be made of various tweets
[00:32:59.360 --> 00:33:04.720]   probably the lawyers will have to finesse a bit about how musk characterized his twitter
[00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:10.160]   stake as a passive investment with I didn't realize he tweeted this April 4th with no intention
[00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:16.160]   to change control the company and then made a takeover offer saying nine days later it's
[00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:23.200]   simply still the case that he made the money by not revealing the yeah I mean I really uncomfortable
[00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:28.880]   with this because we could I mean whether anybody should be a billionaire is an open question but
[00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:36.320]   it sort of seems like small little technical indiscretions which exist in the in the law for reasons
[00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:41.040]   in order to make things fair and give everybody a fair shake um you know all of a sudden don't
[00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:45.680]   count they don't really apply to you and I don't know it's just a form of lawlessness that really
[00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:51.760]   makes me like I feel like things fall apart when rules don't matter and it's not that I'm a huge
[00:33:51.760 --> 00:33:55.760]   law in order person I like mercy I like I like a certain degree of discretion and some of our
[00:33:55.760 --> 00:34:01.920]   laws are just dumb but I kind of don't think they're all dumb and it's sort of nice to know that
[00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:06.720]   they help level the playing field because it means every single person sort of has equal protection
[00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:12.880]   under the law and like this isn't if all of a sudden like oh well you know just has so much
[00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:17.360]   inertia we can't really stop it like too big to fail like it doesn't feel fair for everybody else
[00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:22.640]   who's left Kathy don't you think this boils down to I mean I shouldn't say boils down to but one of
[00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:27.600]   the reasons we have so much discomfort with Elon Musk is that he exposes the way in which somebody
[00:34:27.600 --> 00:34:34.000]   who is like a Trump who's completely shameless and uninterested in in worrying about what the law is
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:41.120]   he's more eager to take action and then often is able through through money or luck or whatever
[00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:45.680]   to escape the consequences so the the pedo guy lawsuit that turned on some interesting
[00:34:45.680 --> 00:34:50.640]   technicalities but he was able to make that statement and then defend it and then essentially
[00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:57.040]   prevail in court in a way that seemed implausible and if he were a person with more shame he would
[00:34:57.040 --> 00:35:02.560]   never have said it or he would have settled if he were a person with less money he would have been
[00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:06.560]   required to settle or maybe not have the representation that would allow him to win and it feels like
[00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:10.800]   the same issue with all the SEC enforcement assets that's the lesson of the last five years
[00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:16.560]   is that we don't know how to handle somebody who's willing to dash norms we don't yeah we
[00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:22.080]   and how much we rely on norms not laws not regulations but norms to get people to behave
[00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:27.840]   and that once people are willing to say screw the norms then the troops follow behind them to do
[00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:34.480]   the same you know the law in Finland if you speed in Finland your your traffic fine is proportionate
[00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:39.680]   to your earnings and i thought we need a law like that for for various kinds of financial and other
[00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:44.640]   crimes in america if if you had a pay something that actually hurt you in the same way that a
[00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:49.280]   traffic fine did in Finland maybe it would change behavior that's 20 million dollars which is
[00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:53.760]   e-lens fine for that tweet somebody did the calculation based on his net worth is about the
[00:35:53.760 --> 00:36:00.720]   equivalent of a small fry at mcdonald's to the rest of us it is a tiny fraction of his income
[00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:08.000]   you mentioned jeff uh that unaccountably jack dorsey was all in on this dick costolo who was the
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:14.960]   former ceo of twitter and is quite bruised from his battles and leading that company tweeted two
[00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:21.440]   hours ago bullying is not leadership two days ago he tweeted shout out to the writers room in
[00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:29.200]   silicon valley for tonight's wild episode
[00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:34.480]   i think the board uh so i i buy a few shares of company here and there so i can get notices
[00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:38.080]   everything so i bought a few shares in my in my 401k for twitter a while a while ago quite a while
[00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:42.800]   ago are you gonna get one of these uh proxies lots of things i mean that's why i do it so i can i
[00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:49.040]   can get that stuff and so as a shareholder the board violated its fiduciary responsibility to me
[00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:53.360]   uh they should have shopped this thing around they should have said fawn you want to do a tender offer
[00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:58.240]   go fight for it good luck they should have they should have fought for well that's uh they just
[00:36:58.240 --> 00:37:04.160]   they just came that's another uh section of the proxy is the opinion of twitter financial advisors
[00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:08.480]   again matt levine which will describe the fairness opinion opinion the twitter's board
[00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:13.600]   government's bankers concerning the price he says i think it was probably not too hard for the
[00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:20.160]   banks to reach that conclusion it was seventy it was sixty nine dollars uh late last year right
[00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:26.160]   right the question was uh what were the prospects for twitter uh levine says i joked yesterday the
[00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:30.960]   bankers would have to tweak the model until makes a horrible clattering noise and bolts start popping
[00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:38.400]   off to get to a fifty four twenty valuation for twitter uh so in other words i don't think they
[00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:43.920]   have too much difficulty justifying accepting the offer um but you're right they didn't they
[00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:50.560]   didn't do any uh nobody's doing any i just think it's really quick yeah um yeah but the problem is i'm
[00:37:50.560 --> 00:37:55.680]   yeah they they said we're gonna do a poison pill and then 36 hours later okay we give up
[00:37:55.680 --> 00:38:02.720]   yeah no i mean that narrative doesn't quite there's a panic in this and you really the stakes are too
[00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:08.000]   high for the speed that everything is happening where matters of huge consequences are all of a
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:14.160]   sudden because the problem is is if the steel fails either because i don't know for whatever
[00:38:14.160 --> 00:38:19.520]   reason it fails what have we done what has just happened i mean people's livelihoods are currently
[00:38:19.520 --> 00:38:23.680]   like hanging in the balance people are already shopping resumes because how can they kind of
[00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:28.800]   sensibly not and you know even if they want to stay and fight like what are we gonna see we are
[00:38:28.800 --> 00:38:34.880]   going he i almost wonder if that actually it's worth the billion dollars to him just to mess
[00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:41.840]   up this company and and he's he's vandalized it essentially already where we've already seen
[00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:47.280]   depletion and oh my gosh what a shame and that really isn't something that should have happened
[00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:52.560]   and now i don't know how we forestall it necessarily but i'm sorry sorry about that he also schmuts
[00:38:53.600 --> 00:39:00.320]   the concept of free speech so like all okay hold that thought here so hold that thought because
[00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:06.400]   we were talking about the the corporate law aspect but let's talk about some other aspects of governance
[00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:11.360]   we got to take a break but uh it's just a great conversation kathie kellis thank you so much for
[00:39:11.360 --> 00:39:14.560]   joining us i know you got to go in about half an hour so we're gonna we're gonna get all the good
[00:39:14.560 --> 00:39:22.400]   stuff in here jeff harvests you're stuck with me stay here and vice versa glenn flyshman hey i
[00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:27.920]   wanted to get you on forever i'm looking at the quality of your video i am looking at the
[00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:34.240]   microphone i am books i i room raider is giving you five out of five not just for the books
[00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:38.320]   ten out of ten but not just for the books but for the black and white photo of people gazing in
[00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:44.400]   awe at what looks like the original iphone over your left shoulder and the steve jobs time cover i
[00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:49.920]   think it's a ted ted turner ten turner appropriate for the cnn perfect i work i work in his is mini
[00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:55.680]   type library on his shelf behind him over oh i see that yeah he also oh yeah tiny line type over
[00:39:55.680 --> 00:40:01.040]   there i think i i think i get the better compliment because he's willing to put up with me and my crappy
[00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:08.720]   wi-fi and terrible camera it's true it's easy to have to win on to meet with standard if i'm good
[00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:15.920]   although uh our personal room raider here uh said uh points off for the uh electrical tape
[00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:20.400]   holding your microphone on to the micron stand but you gotta we gotta work on that we gotta work
[00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:25.120]   on that put some green screen on that in this period anyway thrilled to have all three of you
[00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:31.120]   this conversation will continue yes we will get to google's quarterly report maybe eventually
[00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:35.520]   there will be no change logo i've got to have to draw a line here somewhere the change log by the way
[00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:41.280]   really sucks today so you don't want it folks there's nothing you know what planet cathy probably
[00:40:41.280 --> 00:40:46.160]   don't know this but this used to be a show about google and in order to kind of pay lip service
[00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:51.600]   to its origin and name we do every episode something called the google change log which is new stuff
[00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:58.400]   from google and it's gotten worse and worse and worse over the years and at this point it's just
[00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:05.280]   it's a litany of depressing none i was almost leo i was almost gonna put in there a story about how
[00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:13.200]   google was was making it easier to find some commands in uh docs and i thought no even the
[00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:19.680]   oh cantor no even even i refuse i do want to talk about somebody i'm very happy to to talk about
[00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:27.200]   and code academy these guys are really really great a way to learn to code 50 million people
[00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:34.560]   or learning to code at code academy and if you want to change your career there has never been a
[00:41:34.560 --> 00:41:39.360]   better time to become a programmer there's a huge need a demand for programmers and as you
[00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:47.040]   probably noticed it's a great job great starting pay huge exciting opportunities all over the country
[00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:53.760]   all over the world and with code academy you can learn to code in your own terms 50 million people
[00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:58.480]   already know code academy is the best way to learn to code because code academy not only teaches
[00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:03.200]   you job ready coding skills but also helps you build unique projects that's important for your
[00:42:03.200 --> 00:42:08.480]   portfolio companies will judge you on your you know your github projects you can earn certificates
[00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:13.200]   great for putting on your linked in page you can even prep for technical interviews so you'll be
[00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:19.840]   ready to get that job as soon as you complete it it couldn't be a better time really uh to find a
[00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:26.160]   new job not not a not a crap job if you've recently quit if you're part of the great resignation
[00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:31.680]   now's the time to take some time and learn to code with code academy so fun and i've done this
[00:42:31.680 --> 00:42:36.800]   i've taken their python courses it's nice because as soon as you start coding a code academy
[00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:43.120]   day one you'll be writing real code it's an interactive platform you're actually getting
[00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:47.200]   instant feedback because your code is tested as soon as you submit it even with a very first
[00:42:47.200 --> 00:42:51.840]   lesson so you always know if you're on the right track and there's something anybody who's learned
[00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:58.720]   to code knows that the very first time a computer does what you told it to do is it's an epiphany
[00:42:58.720 --> 00:43:04.560]   it's such an amazing thing and it powers most of us who like to code has powered us ever since
[00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:09.280]   so you'll get that magic moment where you hit the submit button and it goes yeah and it does what
[00:43:09.280 --> 00:43:15.120]   you said it's incredible you'll be learning at your own pace in an area that you want in fact
[00:43:15.120 --> 00:43:19.200]   one of the best things about code academy before you even start they have a programming
[00:43:19.200 --> 00:43:24.880]   personality quiz not not math questions not technical questions but more about you the stuff
[00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:29.760]   that makes you excited the stuff you enjoy doing i took it it said well you should take our computer
[00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:36.240]   science you know track lisa my wife did it she's our she's our c_e_o_ and c_f_o_ and
[00:43:36.240 --> 00:43:41.040]   long-time numbers person they said you should learn statistics and r because you really know your
[00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:48.800]   numbers they nailed it so do do at least do that go to code academy.com use a promo code twig take
[00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:54.320]   the personality quiz so you'll get that tailored career advice and course recommendations just to
[00:43:54.320 --> 00:43:58.480]   see you know what do they think you'd be good at what what what what is your passion
[00:43:58.480 --> 00:44:05.280]   uh you can share choose everything from building basic websites to writing the next great ai
[00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:10.880]   uh no matter your what your experience level you'll be writing real working code in minutes
[00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:18.880]   python html and css sequel javascript they i think they just added us a swift track so you're
[00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:25.200]   really learning real languages that people are using at work right now it's an interactive platform
[00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:31.280]   so there's never a dull moment it's so much fun work at your own pace i think you really want to
[00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:36.880]   check this out and if you've got a young person in your family somebody who has some interest in
[00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:42.080]   technology people are always asking me you know i've got a bright 12 year old how do i how do i
[00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:46.800]   teach him how to code this is a great place to go this is not just i mean i i probably code
[00:44:46.800 --> 00:44:51.600]   academy doesn't want me to say that but it's really great for kids to code academy
[00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:55.920]   join over 50 million people learning to code with code academy see where coding can take you
[00:44:55.920 --> 00:45:00.800]   get 15 percent off your code academy pro membership all you have to do is go to code
[00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:10.080]   academy.com and use the promo code twig promo code twig c o d e c a d e m y code academy.com
[00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:17.920]   for 15 off code academy pro the best way to learn to code coding is so much fun i encourage
[00:45:17.920 --> 00:45:22.720]   anybody who's interested to try it even if maybe you don't know right now that you want to get a
[00:45:22.720 --> 00:45:29.600]   job in programming it is a wonderful hobby to code academy.com promo code twig thank you code
[00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:40.160]   academy for your support of this week in google so elon musk clearly buys twitter because he
[00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:49.280]   why jeff i mean initially i thought always trolling us it's a pump and dump as i said
[00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:54.640]   obviously there's more than that you don't spend 43 billion dollars of other people's money
[00:45:54.640 --> 00:46:00.400]   unless you really have a plan why does is he a free speech advocate is that really what it's
[00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:06.480]   all about i don't think so oh jeff you're me well he's not effective fun it's male ego it's male
[00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:10.560]   ego it's primarily the reason i said so when jeffree ellison was competing with scott mcneighly to
[00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:18.800]   have the tallest yacht that was cool okay that was fine but now it's like who can have the rocket to
[00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:23.200]   the moon who can have the washington post yeah he also likes to cause trouble he likes to have
[00:46:23.200 --> 00:46:28.640]   attention he likes all that but what i was saying before before the break is that and by the way
[00:46:28.640 --> 00:46:33.840]   imagine right now marx ockenberg said you thought you didn't like me you got right
[00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:41.200]   i think i think this is that i nearly tweeted something on monday like congratulations to marx
[00:46:41.200 --> 00:46:47.840]   ockenberg for no longer being the most attested oh god oh god oh wow yeah in fact i think there's a
[00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:52.160]   there's an opportunity but you're going to make things i'm crazy here but we'll be the first time
[00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:58.560]   i think there is an opportunity for facebook and others read it and others to come along and say
[00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:07.520]   what he's doing to free speech we don't agree with this is what free speech means to us this is
[00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:12.000]   what quality speech well well well there's an opportunity political right in the u.s is celebrating
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:17.600]   this they see him as a hero shawn hand they want to attack everybody and not be stopped for doing
[00:47:17.600 --> 00:47:21.840]   shawn hand these twitter account made its triumphant return to twitter pretending that it has anything
[00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:27.600]   to do with elan and not deleting the tweet that got them in trouble in the first place yes um so
[00:47:27.600 --> 00:47:31.760]   the conservatives say this is victory is it a victory for them remember elan must somebody
[00:47:31.760 --> 00:47:38.880]   tweeted elan must stood six hours to shake barack obama's hand he likes power he wants to be around
[00:47:38.880 --> 00:47:43.040]   power it's just power it's not about it's not about it's not about politics the way the wind's blowing
[00:47:43.040 --> 00:47:48.240]   is you know the republican party could be back in charge of uh two of the houses uh both houses of
[00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:53.440]   uh the congress after the midterms and if that were to happen he would be positioning himself
[00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:58.720]   really well if he unbanned all the band uh right wing and far right people oh my gosh when does this
[00:47:58.720 --> 00:48:06.240]   deal close vis-a-vis the next election before uh oh no no vember october no no i don't think he
[00:48:06.240 --> 00:48:11.360]   is so it's not that elan's political but he is a businessman right so is he trying to do what's good
[00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:17.360]   for his business other businesses we don't we don't think he's necessarily the evidence that he's
[00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:23.920]   actually good at stuff is actually really slim and like okay one i think one of the problems we have
[00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:29.040]   with like american mythology is like oh well if the person has a lot of money they must have somehow
[00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:35.120]   merited it in a way and that's repeatedly shown to be a fallacy and i think it's you know here's a
[00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:39.760]   very large exhibit a that that isn't necessarily true but at a certain point when you have resources
[00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:44.720]   you have gravitational pull for other resources because you have power and people want to be in
[00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:50.240]   the orbit of that power and money has interest in compounding and stuff like there's a certain
[00:48:50.240 --> 00:48:55.120]   point where you have escaped velocity where if you've managed to fail your way up you're gonna
[00:48:55.120 --> 00:49:00.640]   keep going up because the physics don't allow you to get clipped very effectively by the way i
[00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:05.360]   want to apologize i mean that's all that you can say for sure i want to apologize i confused
[00:49:05.360 --> 00:49:12.320]   shan hannity with tucker carlson oh i don't know why it's tucker carlson who's back not shan hannick
[00:49:12.320 --> 00:49:17.520]   go ahead i'm sorry Kathy i just i i want to make sure that gets corrected as quickly as possible
[00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:23.680]   what this is this is the animated gift that somebody a tucker carlson fan
[00:49:23.680 --> 00:49:30.640]   posted in response to tuckers we're back yeah okay there you go well no i think we just have to evaluate
[00:49:30.640 --> 00:49:34.880]   things more carefully and like everybody take a deep breath and take a look and let's understand
[00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:41.040]   what is the reality before us which is you know i we give i'm sure there's things he can do
[00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:46.720]   competently so i can't completely say he's a doorknob but like you you we may be presuming too much
[00:49:46.720 --> 00:49:52.160]   especially when he's obviously wrong in terms of his uh how we articulate free speech which
[00:49:52.160 --> 00:49:57.680]   no that's not how it works that's not how any of this works so even crediting the business decisions
[00:49:57.680 --> 00:50:02.400]   isn't necessarily the thing that we need to do especially given that sometimes the things he
[00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:08.800]   does on the business thing is cheap like with all the sec troubles so i i think we shouldn't just
[00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:13.600]   overly credit it but at the same time not necessarily underestimate him either because
[00:50:13.600 --> 00:50:18.560]   even if he accidentally falls into more more power more more resources such as the reality
[00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:25.280]   that we're dealing with uh ishun ishun who uh of course we've quoted a couple of times
[00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:35.440]   uh former uh ceo of uh reddit um has a new tweet uh thread today which he talks a little bit about
[00:50:35.440 --> 00:50:41.120]   this this whole issue and and how difficult it is to do this kind of moderation and specifically
[00:50:41.120 --> 00:50:49.280]   talks about uh free speech um everyone knows this implicitly because quote we will defeat spambots
[00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:55.600]   is actually a curtailment of free speech spambots are expressing someone's view uh he also says it's
[00:50:55.600 --> 00:51:01.360]   not what you say it's how you say it here's another misconception people often make perfectly reasonable
[00:51:01.360 --> 00:51:08.640]   person a holds and expresses viewpoint x okay crazier volatile person b also holds and expresses
[00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:15.360]   viewpoint x quite loudly b gets banned a then believes that viewpoint x is being censored
[00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:24.000]   it's not the case it's how you say it not what you say is that accurate is that the right way to
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:27.920]   moderate a platform like this and can he let him do something like this is that what he means by
[00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:34.160]   free speech no i i don't think this is a fully fleshed out coherent view of free speech because
[00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:38.800]   it's not well tethered to what we already know about free speech so you could make some arguments
[00:51:38.800 --> 00:51:44.560]   to say undercurrent first amendment law in america i think x y and z doesn't make sense here's y and
[00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:48.400]   here's how it should be different and you could pro i don't know if i'd agree but you could probably
[00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:53.120]   intelligently make a cogent argument for why or how things should be different that's not what he's
[00:51:53.120 --> 00:51:58.160]   doing he's sort of like stopping his feet and denying that gravity exists like it's not new he's not
[00:51:58.160 --> 00:52:02.880]   the new expert to just all of a sudden show up and say at last i will think about the things that
[00:52:02.880 --> 00:52:07.440]   everybody has just been neglecting all these years it's not how it works it's not how any of
[00:52:07.440 --> 00:52:15.600]   this works and oh my gosh in this space all all around regulators billionaires everybody just stop
[00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:23.920]   stop and take stock and figure out things work big old grown amiable because if we're not careful
[00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:27.360]   we're gonna break stuff and we're gonna be really sad when it's all broken and gone
[00:52:27.360 --> 00:52:33.360]   kathy i was just prompted by something you said earlier just a moment ago which was
[00:52:33.360 --> 00:52:38.720]   i think there might be a lies to reality ratio that determines how rich you can get
[00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:44.560]   and so if your ratio is too high you were uh thiernose and uh uh Elizabeth um
[00:52:44.560 --> 00:52:51.200]   i'd like to add her last day homes homes thank you so she had show her reach exceeded her grasp
[00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:55.920]   by too much it's not totally implausible what thiernose could have done uh you know it seems
[00:52:55.920 --> 00:53:00.240]   like it might be beyond current capabilities and you have steve jobs right who's lies to reality
[00:53:00.240 --> 00:53:06.240]   ratio sometimes got bigger or smaller but executed and elon musk somewhere in there he is audacious
[00:53:06.240 --> 00:53:13.600]   things that he says that are that are easily not backed by verifiable information so that
[00:53:13.600 --> 00:53:19.600]   is really lies but exaggeration uh that have helped him amass these fortunes and he's always
[00:53:19.600 --> 00:53:25.920]   willing to push up against that line as far as possible but then deliver enough so i kind of think
[00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:31.520]   that he doesn't have that same thing going with twitter that he did with tesla like tesla arguably
[00:53:31.520 --> 00:53:37.200]   pushed the world closer to electric cars faster because elon is willing to disregard environmental
[00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:44.000]   regulation and workplace regulation uh work hours um you know sec rule like there's a whole litany
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:48.960]   of things there's these allegations of racial discrimination in his plants there's all kinds of
[00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:54.640]   things that he disregarded in order to push this technology further and get us electric cars faster
[00:53:54.640 --> 00:53:58.560]   so you can say well it's reasonable he's the richest person in the world because he has pushed
[00:53:58.560 --> 00:54:03.520]   the entire economy of the world closer to electric cars but we had a deal with all this stuff and on
[00:54:03.520 --> 00:54:07.840]   the twitter side it's like well it's all abuse like what is it that he's gonna do that's gonna push
[00:54:07.840 --> 00:54:13.840]   the world to a better place in spite of all the abuse he causes and inspires i don't see what it is
[00:54:13.840 --> 00:54:18.800]   yeah i don't see a value add i mean to your first point i might also say what you were like is
[00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:23.760]   there a ratio and i might say can we control that ratio for gender because i'm not entirely sure
[00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:28.320]   the standards are quite the same there may be certain things of like i don't know really like
[00:54:28.320 --> 00:54:34.080]   jeff was saying or he basically said as much like it's boys with toys and like oh well you know
[00:54:34.080 --> 00:54:39.200]   boys will be boys and stuff like that and they're well of course you know we can't help himself so
[00:54:39.200 --> 00:54:45.600]   you know he's gonna you know infringe a few work rules environmental rules like that's just who he
[00:54:45.600 --> 00:54:51.200]   is i mean because we did that with donald trump for four years as well oh that's how he is and um
[00:54:51.200 --> 00:54:58.400]   our tolerance for the intolerable i think may need some tweaking um and it's not to say that we
[00:54:58.400 --> 00:55:03.680]   should have law that is overly punitive or no mercy or anything like that but i think this idea of
[00:55:03.680 --> 00:55:08.880]   too big to fail too big to punish too big to you know hold to the same standards that everybody
[00:55:08.880 --> 00:55:13.600]   else is is something that i think we that's something that you know if regulators would like to pay
[00:55:13.600 --> 00:55:18.160]   attention to is i think we've got some really big structural problems with how we organize our
[00:55:18.160 --> 00:55:24.640]   society and our law reflects it or issue twitter is twitter is the canary that's tweeting away the
[00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:30.480]   warning of what is going on um that this is happening is sort of like hang on i think we have
[00:55:30.480 --> 00:55:34.400]   problems because he could be doing this to twitter but he could be doing this too and a whole
[00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:38.560]   bunch of other contexts and none of them would be good but i think because it's interfacing with
[00:55:38.560 --> 00:55:43.200]   speech and expression and the ability for our community to hold itself together and talk to
[00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:48.720]   itself talk to each other um that there's this particular kind of pain that will come out of
[00:55:48.720 --> 00:55:53.520]   essentially what's recklessness and you know the recklessness nape may hurt him but the
[00:55:53.520 --> 00:55:57.920]   rest of us are going down with him and um that's a problem because he can absorb the fall much
[00:55:57.920 --> 00:56:04.080]   better than the rest of us can uh Derek Thompson writes in the atlantic that
[00:56:04.080 --> 00:56:09.920]   Elon could actually be good for twitter unlike the board he actually uses twitter
[00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:17.440]   and actually likes twitter another romantic hot take which makes him a candidate to fix it no
[00:56:17.440 --> 00:56:22.160]   no no no for a couple of reasons and one of the things that i want to praise twitter for at least
[00:56:22.160 --> 00:56:28.000]   historically is twitter has been unique and at its best moments one of the reasons that it tended
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:33.280]   to grow and improve was because it was very responsive to its users and i think one of my
[00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:36.800]   favorite things that i don't think i'm making up i don't think it's apocryphal is even the way we
[00:56:36.800 --> 00:56:42.720]   do the at's being hyperlinked and the and the hashtags turning into hyperlinks was i think a
[00:56:42.720 --> 00:56:48.400]   google engineering essentially looking at the the lexicalogical behavior of its users
[00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:53.600]   and saying oh this seems to be how people address them each other yes yeah and they recognize that
[00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:58.240]   that's what people were doing yeah christmas seemed to add the hashtag and and then twitter
[00:56:58.240 --> 00:57:03.520]   said oh yeah that's a good idea yeah yeah and the answer and to build the hyperlinks around it like
[00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:09.200]   it looked at what the users were doing and built responsive design to what the users were doing
[00:57:09.200 --> 00:57:13.920]   and that's twitter at its best that's any platform at its best when you look at your user community
[00:57:13.920 --> 00:57:18.240]   and you build the tools that they need and so he doesn't because yes he's a user and yes he has
[00:57:18.240 --> 00:57:23.520]   his own personal this that or the other thing but he certainly doesn't have um an endemic view of
[00:57:23.520 --> 00:57:28.240]   like what most of the live experience would be of any other twitter user other than the other
[00:57:28.240 --> 00:57:32.960]   billionaires like it's so exceptional he can't walk in anybody else's shoes and he's not interested
[00:57:32.960 --> 00:57:38.800]   in understanding who else is in any other user shoes so am i alone on the panel in saying i'm
[00:57:38.800 --> 00:57:43.040]   going to wait and see and give them the benefit of that and maybe it'll get better or is that
[00:57:43.040 --> 00:57:46.080]   just not possible jeff you don't see me yeah you're alone
[00:57:46.080 --> 00:57:55.920]   yeah i mean i will i do have a massive uninstanced my very own yeah i will tell myself whatever
[00:57:55.920 --> 00:58:00.640]   lie i need to to sleep at night but i'm not entirely sure then the light of day i think i have a
[00:58:00.640 --> 00:58:06.960]   tremendous a sense of optimism of a twitter of a must-controlled twitter except to the extent that
[00:58:06.960 --> 00:58:12.800]   it might somehow manage to be a catalyst for leave him to his crumbling empire and the rest of us
[00:58:12.800 --> 00:58:19.040]   will go build something good uh breaking views just put up a piece uh i just put on the rundown
[00:58:19.040 --> 00:58:23.200]   bottom of the very long twitter section that says they don't they don't think he's gonna buy it
[00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:28.800]   really i would he's gonna be willing to pay a billion dollars to walk away i'm not sure willing
[00:58:28.800 --> 00:58:33.520]   but he may be stuck with it i mean not leaving argues that actually he can't walk away like he
[00:58:33.520 --> 00:58:36.880]   can't just pay a billion dollars at the twitter board could go to him and shake him down with the
[00:58:36.880 --> 00:58:41.360]   deal say you made the deal because it's a personal contract it can force him to be
[00:58:41.360 --> 00:58:46.320]   says it could cost as much as 21 billion his personal stake in it which should i mean i know
[00:58:46.320 --> 00:58:53.680]   elan has 270 billion theoretically well less today well less today but uh i don't think he has
[00:58:53.680 --> 00:59:00.720]   21 billion hanging around in the closet um so why so they say elan mess this is loren sylvia uh
[00:59:00.720 --> 00:59:08.480]   sylva loflin and jina chon writing at on writers probably won't buy twitter uh i love the the
[00:59:08.480 --> 00:59:13.440]   anecdote at the beginning four years ago elan musk vowed to set up a peanut brittle company
[00:59:13.440 --> 00:59:20.960]   this is not a joke just remember this to take on war and buffets iconic u.s. confectioner sees candies
[00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:27.440]   then he changed his mind it wouldn't be surprising if musk's deal to buy twitter went the same way
[00:59:27.440 --> 00:59:34.400]   i i don't i mean this is i go back to the corporate law because you need a path for failure you can't
[00:59:34.400 --> 00:59:39.440]   just decide it but there's something about this that just smells so iffy because we can see the
[00:59:39.440 --> 00:59:43.760]   iffyness all over the place so this is not how business typically not done in any respect there
[00:59:43.760 --> 00:59:48.800]   are paths for failure if there's a mass exodus and suddenly twitter you know as a falling apart that
[00:59:48.800 --> 00:59:53.840]   that won't give him cause for withdrawing twitter could withdraw because there is a non-disparagement
[00:59:53.840 --> 00:59:58.320]   clause in their agreement and clearly he's already violated has already violated that
[00:59:58.320 --> 01:00:06.160]   so there are ways out uh and a billion dollars is not the end of the world for elan uh it might be
[01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:12.000]   for twitter twitter has earnings coming out shortly too and so some people have suspected the earnings
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:16.960]   may be terrible which would give him an option to get so maybe elan has been trolling us all along
[01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:23.200]   knows that these earnings are miss suck well i don't think this isn't uh miscellaneous people
[01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:26.720]   have noticed and they thought that some people have thought that that's why the board actually
[01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:30.720]   took the deal because they thought that the earnings were going to deflate the stock price and this
[01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:35.680]   might be better i think i mean it's hard to say what should happen there's just this is just such
[01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:41.360]   a crazy deal that maybe it was the right move but such a borderline right move that it's hard to say
[01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:46.320]   and everything is changing under our feet immediately i mean de-allewing the company the other thing
[01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:52.240]   that's telling is the actual stock price of twitter because in theory if elan's gonna pay
[01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:58.320]   right fifty four twenty four it the share price should come close to fifty four twenty anything
[01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:03.840]   less is a profit it's right now at forty eight sixty four it's dropped uh two percent today
[01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:08.640]   which tells you that that's the stock market saying yeah we don't think it's gonna happen if they did
[01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:14.480]   they'd be buying we're gonna hedge the bet yeah what happens to pareg agro agro are
[01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:20.400]   first of all i hope he's gone because i can't say his name agro wall that's a terrible reason
[01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:26.640]   in pareg you're a nice guy i'm sorry what happens to pareg though uh he just became the CEO of twitter
[01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:32.240]   he's gotta be gone right oh well they all have change of change of ownership clauses in their
[01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:37.200]   contract oh yeah he has i i think a huge parachute several but jaya gade who's brilliant who's the
[01:01:37.200 --> 01:01:43.680]   head of safety and and law uh musk set loose his dogs on her it's just awful so they're just waiting
[01:01:43.680 --> 01:01:49.840]   until they can cash out and they're all actually i'm wondering to what extend down the tree those
[01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:54.800]   change in ownership clauses may actually be another most packages agro wall's golden parachute is
[01:01:54.800 --> 01:02:01.760]   thirty nine million jack dorsey not can could based on his two point two percent of twitter make nine
[01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:07.360]   hundred seventy eight million no wonder he's happy could it be rats deserting a sinking ship going
[01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:13.120]   yeah you want come on there was awfully quick they changed their tune very fast
[01:02:13.120 --> 01:02:18.800]   uh i i'm wondering if um very very very smart people on the twitter side actually do know what's
[01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:25.360]   going on i do not think that if i were to put sort of who i think there's more smart people on the
[01:02:25.360 --> 01:02:28.800]   well this is mathematically true there's more smart people on the twitter side than there are
[01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:34.960]   on the alan musk side just by sheer numbers numbers alone just by sheer numbers but i think i meant
[01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:39.200]   that is more of a compliment that i think twitter may have more smart people in the right smart people
[01:02:39.200 --> 01:02:44.080]   who may be wise enough to try to guide this more carefully and i don't think that care is necessarily
[01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:49.360]   on the musk side but i don't want to underestimate him either it does well honestly look like a
[01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:55.120]   terrible business decision on elan's part oh yeah yeah yeah unless i mean i would say does he have a
[01:02:55.120 --> 01:03:00.560]   incredible plan but he he he's never given any instance of that there was a great book a few
[01:03:00.560 --> 01:03:05.280]   years ago called the accidental zillionaire about paul alan yeah that came out at exactly the wrong
[01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:10.560]   time i know the author a little bit and uh uh is a great book but it came out exactly when
[01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:16.480]   all of paul alan's foresight paid off so up until that point you can make the argument that's right
[01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:20.960]   everything he'd done had been happenstance in the timing and then suddenly everything
[01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:25.520]   because he was so far ahead of everybody else with so many ideas and then they all paid off and then
[01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:29.120]   and then for the next i think 15 years after the book came out it was like oh no this guy is a
[01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:34.240]   genius but in 2002 he didn't look quite so bright and i'm like does that happen to elan musk do we
[01:03:34.240 --> 01:03:39.760]   think this guy became the richest person in the world because he had a few good ideas and he'd
[01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:45.600]   work people to death and then this magical thing happened and then rest of his life were like oh
[01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:49.840]   no no that makes sense it makes sense he made all this money i i don't feel it or the opposite him
[01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:56.400]   or he's already he's already uh so made the contract with with the devil uh dr fouss here
[01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:58.720]   yeah um as gotten what he's going to get
[01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:07.760]   it's kind of a shame i think we'll see this i'd say this looking back on it that's something that had
[01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:14.320]   such promises twitter and and really was so important for quite a while in the national zeitgeist
[01:04:15.040 --> 01:04:22.400]   uh should end this way so i want to make sure that um i'm very very very sad for this platform that
[01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:26.400]   i think a lot of really dedicated people have been very genuinely working very hard to build
[01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:32.640]   into something cool but my concern is that we don't survive the loss of it because we've so
[01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:38.480]   hobbled the ecosystem that we can't get something else that's new from these ashes we have to get
[01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:44.000]   something better we need to get more better and i think my my closing comments was to repeat what
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:50.560]   i was saying is take a deep breath people keep breaking things they don't understand this is a
[01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:55.840]   lot must breaking the quality of his own investment this is regulators who keep trying to misunderstand
[01:04:55.840 --> 01:05:00.560]   the problems and propose solutions and everybody needs to stop and take a deep breath that's
[01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:06.800]   regulators in washington that's regulators in the state i point to minnesota's currently trying to
[01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:12.880]   move something really this is going to make a mess don't do it everybody stop and let's have
[01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:19.040]   europe um name it um we need to be more careful because this whole pretense that at last we are
[01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:23.920]   the smart people who are going to come and take care of everything is not smart because it ignores
[01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:27.760]   the smart people who have already been there and working very hard at things and i think we need
[01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:33.600]   to listen to who's in the space and who's paying attention and these are hard complex problems and
[01:05:33.600 --> 01:05:39.120]   issues and also really exciting things that provide value to everybody humanity democracy
[01:05:39.120 --> 01:05:44.160]   speech communication um this isn't going to be solved overnight not with simple legislation
[01:05:44.160 --> 01:05:49.440]   not with a weird takeover thing like we need to we need to be careful because this is really
[01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:54.400]   important stuff that an awful lot of people lives livelihoods are all depending on so
[01:05:54.400 --> 01:06:00.400]   kathie with that uh thank you perfect valid victory address yes because we're gonna

[01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:37.360]   there may not be much twitter left for elana takeover because what is twitter but a bunch of
[01:06:37.360 --> 01:06:43.200]   talented engineers who are relying on their stock options for compensation and that compensation
[01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:48.240]   may have just been undermined completely um but we'll talk about that when we come back

[01:08:05.600 --> 01:08:09.520]   selecting those are the greatest growth potential then brings them to you why private
[01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:13.760]   these are companies that haven't yet gone public they are not well known they haven't had an exit
[01:08:13.760 --> 01:08:20.080]   yet this is getting in at the very beginning in some of the most exciting technologies out there
[01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:26.880]   right now from personalized medicine to robotics to cyber security where companies spend a hundred
[01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:33.440]   and fifty billion dollars annually on cyber security these are very much growth areas
[01:08:33.440 --> 01:08:39.360]   and our crowd is smart they're going out and identifying innovators so you can invest when the

[01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:46.560]   minimum investment for the funds is fifty thousand dollars so you do have to have at least ten thousand
[01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:52.000]   dollars you must be an accredited investor the terms though will vary on depending on what
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:57.040]   country you're in so just go in and put the country at our crowd.com/twig i'll give you an
[01:09:57.040 --> 01:10:03.760]   example of one of the companies right now you can invest in it's called sotero so t-e-r-o
[01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:09.920]   they have developed and patented i might add a new approach to data protection that eliminates
[01:10:09.920 --> 01:10:14.640]   the gaps of traditional methods securing any data asset and it doesn't it can be on-prem or in
[01:10:14.640 --> 01:10:21.200]   the cloud and right now sotero is being trusted by one of the world's largest pharmaceutical companies
[01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:28.240]   so this is a really uh inside look at something that is potentially could be huge but that's the
[01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:33.840]   excitement of our crowd so explore seteros potential before you invest obviously at OUR

[01:11:04.320 --> 01:11:09.600]   i follow you that's where i got to go yeah i used to get i i guess i'll say jeff i've said this to
[01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:13.280]   you privately it's such a pleasure because i grew up reading you in tv guide and there's always
[01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:19.280]   something i mean i don't want to aid you but it was it's like seeing a character sure come to life
[01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:23.600]   are you sitting in the corner i say that every week yes he's a real person
[01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:28.960]   he's a real person i feel the same way Glenn i grew up reading him and well i grew up we're the
[01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:33.200]   same age but i read him in the examiner when he was here in san francisco for years and i'm very
[01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:37.600]   familiar with the byline and so it was a real thrill when he started working here so i was
[01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:41.840]   i tried to explain to my kids you know there's a thing called tv guide and we used to get tv listings
[01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:47.360]   and you look you pour over the couch circle things you'd plug in your vcr plus number
[01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:52.400]   it was really important and it had the easiest crossword of any major publication
[01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:57.440]   that i want to make you feel it yeah i used twitter i used to get rasp using twitter because i used
[01:11:57.440 --> 01:12:01.520]   it almost like my own personal message board back when it was younger and i just i just was on
[01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:05.120]   it way too much and posted it was kind of always there in the background and at some point you know
[01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:11.520]   when you exceed 500 000 tweets one must reevaluate one's life so i deleted a lot of old tweets
[01:12:11.520 --> 01:12:16.880]   i just deleted most of my history at one point after politics got too complicated to uh
[01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:21.760]   lead in the same thing yeah a lot of people i know have self-deleting tweets which is great they
[01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:28.080]   like uh think marco arment has a uh your creative overcast and other fine products uh he has i
[01:12:28.080 --> 01:12:32.880]   believe a thing that just goes through and like after maybe a few days deletes all the tweets
[01:12:32.880 --> 01:12:38.000]   older that it was i want a good idea actually it's kind of neat the it's like it's my memory i have
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:42.400]   to go back i know i i know i linked to that i know i talked about that and i used twitter advanced
[01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:46.400]   search all the time to just find stuff i can't remember because i'm old well in effect i think i
[01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:52.400]   know about u glenn because of your prolific tweeting i'm sure that's i'm sure that's where i first
[01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:56.480]   became aware of you so it was fun there was a point where when twitter was fun there was
[01:12:56.480 --> 01:13:02.240]   yes before right-wing politics and i mean i don't want it let's listen i try not to be too biased and
[01:13:02.240 --> 01:13:06.640]   anything i say but it's that it was that there was a particular kind of mode on twitter or mood on
[01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:11.840]   twitter and then it wasn't that there's anything specifically wrong with people who have right
[01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:17.120]   of center beliefs but there was a specific tranche of people on the right and particularly far right
[01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:22.720]   and even you know alt and nazi right who invaded twitter and made it kind of unusable uh through
[01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:26.480]   abuse and other stuff and so it wasn't you know it wasn't like uh i don't know it wasn't like a
[01:13:26.480 --> 01:13:30.240]   george will republican it was not a republican anymore right he's not even registered as much
[01:13:30.240 --> 01:13:36.240]   it was a very specific attempt and that was gamified or it was attested with gamer gate years ago and
[01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:40.400]   then rolled out with the trump campaign and now became the dominant way that twitter gets used
[01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:45.200]   uh in political battles and and other things and so there was a time when it was fun and you'd
[01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:49.680]   meet people and be like hey i've made friendships you go to conferences you'd know a hundred people
[01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:54.480]   when you came to a new time i don't think that ended in 2016 i feel like it ended earlier than that
[01:13:54.480 --> 01:14:00.640]   yeah i 2014 2013 maybe it's been a while but if you're and honestly it was rising tide it's not
[01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:08.160]   the content of tweets uh that ever bother me it's the just as as you shan says the delivery
[01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:14.240]   it's how they say it not behave they say it's behavior yeah um and for many years i mean
[01:14:14.240 --> 01:14:22.960]   i i got on twitter first in 2006 i was quit it briefly because uh i was concerned about name
[01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:28.880]   confusion um and then uh i think it was i just dink said no you have to be on twitter so i rejoined
[01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:35.520]   in april 2007 um and i don't think i have a half million tweets but uh it was very active in the
[01:14:35.520 --> 01:14:40.400]   early days how many do i have oh god i was wrong but i've deleted i've deleted all up to a few years
[01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:45.280]   ago it's it's dangerous if you find out how many you've made but you know jeff's on it even as we do
[01:14:45.280 --> 01:14:50.400]   the show is which is much too much to my chagrin yeah it you know it's the foundation of my and so
[01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:55.600]   many other people's independent careers too is i'm a freelance journalist and um yeah i became a
[01:14:55.600 --> 01:15:00.800]   type and print historian you know kind of through the back door by by tweeting a lot and meeting other
[01:15:00.800 --> 01:15:08.480]   people i have a i developed a group of a fellow aficionados of this kind of paper plate that was
[01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:13.760]   used to cast metal plates before uh offset printing called flong and i mean you find the
[01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:18.480]   most obscure subgroups and we talk about i wanted to go to one of glens events and it was sold out
[01:15:18.480 --> 01:15:26.080]   already a good long event for god's long event sold out long long events wow yeah it's but it's great
[01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:28.560]   man this man i want to show you this i want to show you this oh yeah
[01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:35.200]   it's a book about gutenberg no no it's a pop up pop up it's a gutenberg pop up
[01:15:35.200 --> 01:15:41.280]   that is amazing pops up a printing press did somebody send you that jeff i bought it from the
[01:15:41.280 --> 01:15:47.760]   uh this was from the uh museum of print in haverill mass nice institution i have never been
[01:15:47.760 --> 01:15:55.120]   there great oh you'd you'd fell there oh i would just i would have to move in just down the road from
[01:15:55.120 --> 01:15:59.280]   mark twain's line of type and hard fruit canada that's that's right mark twain james
[01:15:59.280 --> 01:16:05.120]   the mark twain who funded the uh the uh machine that bankrupted him the types of
[01:16:05.120 --> 01:16:11.600]   thing machine that bankrupt hard to believe but there is other elon musk news uh hard to believe
[01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:18.320]   but it may explain why broken hearted he's buying twitter in the trial the the libel trial
[01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:24.480]   between amber heard and johnnie dep amber heard said she never really loved elon musk
[01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:31.920]   and was filling space with him following johnnie dep breakup pull out of the heart oh i never
[01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:39.520]   loved you elon i'm buying twitter so now we know i think now we know exactly what happened
[01:16:40.640 --> 01:16:47.440]   um oh god he's just incredible that trial there's too much we know too much about too many people
[01:16:47.440 --> 01:16:54.800]   yeah exactly what twitter's about so yeah yeah what okay just so uh i mean it's probably not
[01:16:54.800 --> 01:17:01.920]   time to eulogize twitter or maybe it is but what are some of your favorite uh twitter tropes or
[01:17:01.920 --> 01:17:07.600]   twitter moments or uh you know things that happened on twitter remember when people used to uh
[01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:12.000]   instead of doing a google search they do uh uh what do they call it a twitter search or a twitter
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:18.560]   uh a crowd mind you know what was that called that was fun and if mine hive mind or something
[01:17:18.560 --> 01:17:22.800]   and they would they would say on twitter well what do you think and you'd get hundreds of tweets
[01:17:22.800 --> 01:17:28.160]   about a subject oh those were always fun i think things started going downhill when people
[01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:34.320]   started doing long threads maybe two hundred eighty characters it wasn't a great idea no i i
[01:17:34.320 --> 01:17:38.880]   i was against two idiot first but no i think that that's wrong i liked it i mean i i met glen
[01:17:38.880 --> 01:17:43.360]   because i got in all my gudenberg stuff and there's this guy who's doing this amazing stuff around
[01:17:43.360 --> 01:17:48.720]   gudenberg it was purely in twitter we took a core he also it was because of him i saw that he was
[01:17:48.720 --> 01:17:54.400]   taking a course uh in um in the gudenberg bible we ended up taking it together virtually it was
[01:17:54.400 --> 01:18:02.320]   great i have my um uh gudenberg my book history walks uh twitter list is my happy place but all
[01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:09.600]   this has to be too much list i go there there's another thing that twitter uh doesn't really
[01:18:09.600 --> 01:18:13.760]   bring to the foreground but is one of the most powerful and interesting things i know that i
[01:18:13.760 --> 01:18:20.400]   follow your uh i follow during the covid pandemic your covid experts list jeff that was really a
[01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:26.640]   great thing to have um people don't use lists all that much but that was another nice feature of uh
[01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:33.680]   early early twitter we i remember i always go back to his uh you know the drill account the uh that
[01:18:33.680 --> 01:18:39.680]   dr il which is this guy i think he finally admitted who he was but it's it's this whole uh um
[01:18:39.680 --> 01:18:47.280]   he just does these amazing strange tweets that are incredibly zeitgeisty and funny and yet impossible
[01:18:47.280 --> 01:18:53.680]   to explain even in context and there's one he made many years ago i'm not owned i'm not owned i
[01:18:53.680 --> 01:19:00.000]   continue to insist as i slowly shrink and transform into a corn cob and some days that's the only
[01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:05.920]   thing it's it's just it's just all of what people are doing right it's just uh it's just uh uh
[01:19:05.920 --> 01:19:12.240]   twenty twenty eleven it just summarizes so much of discourse people saying you know especially
[01:19:12.240 --> 01:19:16.560]   people just they start shouting louder and louder i didn't i'm correct i'm not wrong it doesn't matter
[01:19:16.560 --> 01:19:22.000]   that you have tapes that show me saying i'm lying as they shrink into a corn cob actually that's a
[01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:26.320]   good point one of the things yeline says is everybody all have to have be authenticated
[01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:31.680]   use their real names uh one of the best things about twitter is the parody accounts the fake accounts
[01:19:31.680 --> 01:19:37.840]   uh the weird times new spot is the is the best of the time it is is you follow that i hope yeah
[01:19:37.840 --> 01:19:43.200]   really and the times is on it or is that is that that one no no this is different one no this is
[01:19:43.200 --> 01:19:50.960]   doug j balloon the the ny times new spot and and so it's it's inside his head i presume it's a his
[01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:56.000]   calls himself dog when it's made up name um where he comes up with the headlines that he's sure the
[01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:00.960]   times is going to do then sometimes he tweets an actual times headline and it's like is this the
[01:20:00.960 --> 01:20:07.760]   onion is this new spot it's the town all the times really did do that um and there is also i've just
[01:20:07.760 --> 01:20:14.960]   found searching for that a uh account called impressions of the times that creates uses an ai
[01:20:14.960 --> 01:20:20.640]   to create illustrations from times headlines oh that's pretty isn't that interesting um
[01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:28.160]   when muskwa worship sunken russian disinformation faces a test was the inspiration for this would
[01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:32.560]   have beautiful work of art kind of lovely yeah impressions of the times that's a new account
[01:20:32.560 --> 01:20:41.200]   uh we early on we we wanted we tried a novel uh i think it was called novel 140 where you could
[01:20:41.200 --> 01:20:46.960]   only write a 40 140 characters of the novel and we had a bunch of people each writing
[01:20:46.960 --> 01:20:52.320]   tweets in succession the novel never got very far but it was kind of interesting i thought twitter
[01:20:52.320 --> 01:20:57.280]   would be used more for fiction at times yeah i've seen examples of it and one thing i was hoping
[01:20:57.280 --> 01:21:01.920]   is that people would play games on twitter these are the things that so so twitter has left all
[01:21:01.920 --> 01:21:07.600]   this lowfrying hanging fruit why not not gamify twitter but not i mean you could have scripted events
[01:21:07.600 --> 01:21:11.440]   or even improv events happening among accounts that would be incredibly fun to observe
[01:21:11.440 --> 01:21:17.920]   in a sort of special space or a timeline um when you lose your cat you know you you post a
[01:21:17.920 --> 01:21:23.600]   lost my cat and people in timbuktu are retweeting it yeah helpful i appreciate the sentiment but
[01:21:23.600 --> 01:21:29.360]   why not have regional local twitter sections instead they're like well clubhouse obviously a great
[01:21:29.360 --> 01:21:35.440]   idea let's make twitter spaces and do audio on a text oriented medium that's been very successful
[01:21:35.440 --> 01:21:39.760]   so i just feel like there's a it's not that there's a positive ideas i just don't feel like they push
[01:21:39.760 --> 01:21:44.400]   in the right direction so one part of me is like all right in the best complexion even though i
[01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:49.360]   don't think musk anything he said indicates trust in this direction in the best way it could be what
[01:21:49.360 --> 01:21:54.640]   if you did bring in a bunch of new ideas or brought into really interesting challenging staff that
[01:21:54.640 --> 01:21:59.760]   just totally shook things up and they kept the best of twitter and tweaked it and added stuff we
[01:21:59.760 --> 01:22:05.920]   actually liked i mean it's not infeasible it's unlikely but there's so much room for those kinds of
[01:22:05.920 --> 01:22:12.720]   things to happen actually he may have to do that because i don't know how much of the current twitter
[01:22:12.720 --> 01:22:18.720]   team is likely to be around when he walks in the door um you were asking that that earlier is that
[01:22:18.720 --> 01:22:23.920]   if you have options with strike prices and so forth you you join because you hope there was an upside
[01:22:23.920 --> 01:22:29.520]   and if the upside is exactly five fifty four dollars and twenty cents there are things they can do to
[01:22:29.520 --> 01:22:34.000]   keep employees where they uh even though it's a privately held company they can use different
[01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:38.240]   valuations so there's more to sweeten it but if you join the last couple of years you might have
[01:22:38.240 --> 01:22:42.400]   no opportunity to have an upside so why would you stay you just have your you know keep your options
[01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:47.280]   you have your options to be redeemed or or whatever um if they weren't doing stock one of the reason
[01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:51.920]   silicon valley companies go public is so that they have a liquid market for options that they can then
[01:22:51.920 --> 01:22:57.280]   hire employees with private companies i've been screwed by private stock in private companies
[01:22:57.280 --> 01:23:04.400]   it's very you know there's a there's a long and oh yeah sorted sorted tale there uh if it's not a
[01:23:04.400 --> 01:23:09.360]   public company forget it right it's not a real option so there's that's a good reason to stay
[01:23:09.360 --> 01:23:15.600]   public and that's the good i had phantom equity yeah in entertainment weekly and in advanced local
[01:23:15.600 --> 01:23:22.960]   air sure i had phantom equity in tech tv um yeah i found a stop arch here as a way
[01:23:22.960 --> 01:23:32.080]   i almost had phantom equity in cnet but uh that didn't materialize so never mind um speaking of
[01:23:32.080 --> 01:23:41.520]   cnet what the hell? Glenn right here is an expert in typography i want to get his view of the
[01:23:41.520 --> 01:23:47.520]   typographical uh artistry of this logo so yesterday a number of people were shocked when they went
[01:23:47.520 --> 01:23:55.920]   to cnet.com uh let me refresh the page so you get the full effect oh and what is the typeface
[01:23:55.920 --> 01:24:01.680]   here that they're using it's a kind of archaic looking Glenn you might you might recognize this
[01:24:01.680 --> 01:24:06.800]   there's a sans serif menu bar but the but the headlines are in some sort of weird serif
[01:24:07.360 --> 01:24:11.280]   ifty tool the font's called sentinel i have an ifty two cold what's that font and i click on it
[01:24:11.280 --> 01:24:18.480]   i was fast what is tells you the font sentinel huh yeah monument grotesque is the uh the
[01:24:18.480 --> 01:24:24.880]   aptly named protect money uh and then uh yeah sentinel these are probably gonna be open source
[01:24:24.880 --> 01:24:30.240]   fonts uh yeah it's a little bit old-fashioned it has horrible uh quotation marks though don't you
[01:24:30.240 --> 01:24:35.040]   think they're gonna make straight curves oh yeah that's like you're not you're not to use the right
[01:24:35.040 --> 01:24:40.560]   quotation marks yeah but it's tilted it's like an inch mark or a foot mark rather uh don't get
[01:24:40.560 --> 01:24:44.640]   your inch and foot marks together or the or the stone hinge order will be the wrong sign there's
[01:24:44.640 --> 01:24:52.800]   some very odd like look at tv look at the uh the turning there's turning there is very strange
[01:24:52.800 --> 01:24:58.160]   it's i don't know you know there's a trend that every tech site uh in a lot of other sites
[01:24:58.160 --> 01:25:02.800]   move from intricate designs and maybe we're over designed to it's just white it's just some black
[01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:07.040]   text on a white background well yeah once you get past the differentiates once you get past the uh
[01:25:07.040 --> 01:25:12.000]   the sentinel you get a very bland kind of sancera for the rest of it
[01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:17.920]   made a lot of money doing the sweet design it's a big redesign wow look at that a grotesque by the
[01:25:17.920 --> 01:25:24.400]   way is just a uh a sancer of font oh okay it's the old old term for gothic who should be called
[01:25:24.400 --> 01:25:29.280]   also gothic yeah gothic yeah yeah yeah yeah it's also called yeah like uh so glenn when i when i started
[01:25:29.280 --> 01:25:36.560]   entertainment weekly um i um we had a we had a logo that was controversial because it was it was
[01:25:36.560 --> 01:25:41.120]   tilted they didn't like it da da da and so the bosses came after us go fix this and you got to
[01:25:41.120 --> 01:25:44.320]   do this you got to do that so i go after the design director by the way we had design problems
[01:25:44.320 --> 01:25:48.720]   but he said this the font was grotesque i said well can you find something that's not grotesque
[01:25:48.720 --> 01:25:55.760]   how about this black letter do you like that we're doing false hellvetica hellvetica's
[01:25:55.760 --> 01:26:00.640]   derived from uh was an accident's grotesque is the the rich is like the the protocessor what is the
[01:26:00.640 --> 01:26:05.440]   what is the anemology of grotesque that's very strange oh it's one of these german it's a it's
[01:26:05.440 --> 01:26:08.960]   one of those german things it's uh there's a german derivation of it because it doesn't mean
[01:26:08.960 --> 01:26:17.600]   grotesque as we speak it it's um it's it's a specific uh thing that became applied to it like uh uh
[01:26:17.600 --> 01:26:22.640]   what's the thing like uh not burlesque um uh you talk about something being over elaborate
[01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:29.760]   um the rococo no burles no a burroque right it's kind of like grotesque is just a combination
[01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:35.760]   word that comes from that so it's but it sounds it it meant more like interesting and fantastic
[01:26:35.760 --> 01:26:41.520]   and so it was a different when this when serifs were everything then a grotesque was a different
[01:26:41.520 --> 01:26:47.280]   was used for display faces the same thing like a gothic uh like franklin uh the franklin gothic type
[01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:52.560]   face is a classic sancera from before sancerifs were designed like hellvetica hellvetica kind of
[01:26:52.560 --> 01:26:58.560]   ushered in a new way of designing typefaces without serifs um so yeah you can get these hilarious
[01:26:58.560 --> 01:27:06.320]   names for uh typeface so it's originally g-r-o-t-e-s-k yeah um not the traditional grotesque
[01:27:06.320 --> 01:27:11.120]   you know did you know that there was a typographer a type designer who was hitler's prisoner no
[01:27:11.120 --> 01:27:18.560]   i don't know about this at all you don't oh goody oh i don't like that um so so um um
[01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:26.480]   you know you've seen the gudenberg uh uh uh type which is which is gothic and not in our sense gothic
[01:27:26.480 --> 01:27:30.560]   is oddly we over here call that alvetica but gothic there is is that stuff that was like
[01:27:30.560 --> 01:27:35.280]   gothic cathedral right and it's what the german publications all used and there was actually a
[01:27:35.280 --> 01:27:41.520]   debate in the german parliament about what the official font of germany should be and back and
[01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:51.600]   forth and and and fracture one and hitler liked it for a while but uh then he decided that um
[01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:56.240]   uh it shouldn't be because all the lands they were conquering couldn't read it
[01:27:56.240 --> 01:28:02.400]   and so they decided it was a jewish font oh lord it's famous there's a guy named yon
[01:28:02.400 --> 01:28:07.200]   cheekhold uh i'm gonna mispronounce his name uh it's exactly
[01:28:07.200 --> 01:28:12.160]   pronounced exactly correctly though good uh who pronounced a wrote a book called the new
[01:28:12.160 --> 01:28:17.920]   typography in which he called for a single typeface without a ornamentation no seraphs no nothing
[01:28:17.920 --> 01:28:25.360]   and um he condemned the german front fracture that it was the exclusivist character of that
[01:28:25.360 --> 01:28:32.160]   and this was a dangerous view and so um he said that his views would have died anyway but a few years
[01:28:32.160 --> 01:28:37.920]   after his book hitler came he was accused of creating undurman typography and art
[01:28:37.920 --> 01:28:44.160]   and so they arrested him for his fault and he got a passport out to leave germany
[01:28:44.160 --> 01:28:49.120]   and became the designer of penguin well i'm damned i can tell you this so
[01:28:49.120 --> 01:28:52.880]   frock tour was so associated with german this is a quote i had learned a few years ago uh
[01:28:52.880 --> 01:28:57.280]   otto von dismark the you know the um oh what was he you know he's the uh chancellor of germany
[01:28:57.280 --> 01:29:02.880]   19th century president president sorry and he said he said if i can speak in germans
[01:29:02.880 --> 01:29:09.040]   boycha bucher in latinisha bukshtab alazy heneked which is i don't read german books in latin letters
[01:29:09.040 --> 01:29:14.800]   he would see that if someone sent him a someone sent him something in fracture
[01:29:14.800 --> 01:29:19.680]   yeah it was impossible to read it's very difficult i used to read some when i took german classes
[01:29:19.680 --> 01:29:25.440]   you get a book that was printed oh it's hard oh it's so hard k and the l look it's it was hard for
[01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:30.320]   the i believe i read a statistic i think it was people who read frock tour read it 40 percent more
[01:29:30.320 --> 01:29:35.920]   slowly than reading the same text in latin alphabet it does fit the pronunciation of german though
[01:29:35.920 --> 01:29:41.840]   yes very very nicely i always i think if i look at that now i'm i'm becoming literate i always
[01:29:41.840 --> 01:29:46.720]   look at this and i was like gothic or something but frektor is very specific it's also called gothic
[01:29:46.720 --> 01:29:51.680]   but it's yeah it's fucks tour was a very specific case but yeah it's got a uh there's a there's a
[01:29:51.680 --> 01:29:59.600]   typeface designer who um designed a this guy named uh uh bertold volpe who uh designed albertis
[01:29:59.600 --> 01:30:04.240]   which is a face once you see it you will see it everywhere it was used in the prisoner 1960s prisoner
[01:30:04.240 --> 01:30:10.320]   tv series uh it's just ubiquitous for having a certain kind of uh it feels like a unique appearance
[01:30:10.320 --> 01:30:17.360]   but it is everywhere and volpe was jewish and he had to leave over you know sort of over typeface
[01:30:17.360 --> 01:30:23.200]   design also in the 30s because he was no longer allowed to work even though he had uh he had just
[01:30:23.200 --> 01:30:28.560]   developed in fact a very nice frek to her face and then went to england was sponsored to go there
[01:30:28.560 --> 01:30:33.520]   was sent to australia by boat during the war through u-boat infested waters with other german
[01:30:33.520 --> 01:30:38.720]   nationals even though he had a flea germany then they brought him back and um lived a long happy
[01:30:38.720 --> 01:30:43.760]   life and made a lot of very nice book covers i shall be using albertis from now on it's a wonderful
[01:30:43.760 --> 01:30:49.360]   all of my all of my printing and instead of the quick brown fox i'm going to start saying waltz
[01:30:49.360 --> 01:30:54.480]   bad nymph for quick sijigz vax that's great that's great
[01:30:54.480 --> 01:31:02.320]   do you you know do you spend a lot of money glenn on fonts and typeface digital fonts i don't i have
[01:31:02.320 --> 01:31:07.520]   i have one good you could yeah you could blow a fortune on the new inches great too because the
[01:31:07.520 --> 01:31:11.600]   market for them is smaller uh there's some great stories too is the person who developed the typeface
[01:31:11.600 --> 01:31:18.080]   you think of is that harry potter typeface that's used on merchandise it's guy uh rich kegler of p 22
[01:31:18.080 --> 01:31:23.840]   he's not allowed to disclose the term so if you ask him he can't talk about it but uh was it
[01:31:23.840 --> 01:31:28.640]   Warner brothers owned it at the time they licensed the font for certain usage then they stuck it on
[01:31:28.640 --> 01:31:33.680]   merchandise without having the license for it so i expect there were a lot of zeros behind whatever
[01:31:33.680 --> 01:31:38.880]   number that was settled for but it was right when harry potter was incredibly popular so if you
[01:31:38.880 --> 01:31:44.640]   you'll see a face you'll be like oh that's that face that's that harry potter face and it's because
[01:31:44.640 --> 01:31:49.680]   of that popularization uh but i i own a bunch of p 22 fonts and some monotype fonts but i bought a
[01:31:49.680 --> 01:31:55.200]   lot of typefaces a long time ago uh yeah it's not that one there's one it's unlike merchandise is in
[01:31:55.200 --> 01:32:01.600]   bags and things it's kind of the book uh sometimes you'll see albertis on harry potter sorry i don't
[01:32:01.600 --> 01:32:06.160]   mean to devolve into the no no no and i've got one more question we could we could i would i would
[01:32:06.160 --> 01:32:10.800]   do this i mean i'm so sick of twitter i'm much rather talking about this uh i we will get to the
[01:32:10.800 --> 01:32:16.400]   google uh that google accordingly uh results in just a second but uh i i want to ask you so there
[01:32:16.400 --> 01:32:21.840]   are a lot of free fonts for instance this albertis is being offered for free on cofons.com are those
[01:32:21.840 --> 01:32:26.720]   not as good as you know the fonts that you might get from well-known foundries that cost hundreds of
[01:32:26.720 --> 01:32:32.000]   dollars yes yeah because uh in the united states specifically and in certain other countries in
[01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:37.600]   the world you can't copyright the appearance of a typeface you can only copyright the underlying
[01:32:37.600 --> 01:32:44.480]   code that makes up the typeface so someone can't copy your postscript or open type code and produce
[01:32:44.480 --> 01:32:50.400]   it but after some lawsuits i want to say in the 90s about it uh it became clear that you could
[01:32:50.400 --> 01:32:55.920]   essentially re outline typefaces and then release them so when you buy but the the key thing is
[01:32:55.920 --> 01:33:01.600]   there's all the kerning uh and uh special tweet that goes into a font they can't take that because
[01:33:01.600 --> 01:33:07.520]   that's software so the makers of duplicate fonts um some of them are adaptations and are perfectly
[01:33:07.520 --> 01:33:12.640]   good fonts in their own right and you can go to google fonts and um there's a group called uh is
[01:33:12.640 --> 01:33:18.960]   isl it's uh there's a group that supports uh lesser used uh typefaces or lesser use scripts that are
[01:33:18.960 --> 01:33:24.240]   used for typefaces so native american languages and languages in in asia and other countries where
[01:33:24.240 --> 01:33:29.840]   they have developed really high quality typefaces uh which often include latin characters and
[01:33:29.840 --> 01:33:34.080]   characters in these languages that aren't otherwise supported and give them away for free so you can
[01:33:34.080 --> 01:33:39.520]   go and find super high quality free numbers or it's phenomenal what's available oh my god where
[01:33:39.520 --> 01:33:44.560]   would i find that because i i am a font nerd but i don't want to i've spent hundreds and hundreds
[01:33:44.560 --> 01:33:51.040]   of dollars on fonts for no good reason uh and i would like good quality fonts you know most uh most
[01:33:51.040 --> 01:33:57.360]   google most uh linux and uh mac distributions offer a lot of fonts for free for download the nerd
[01:33:57.360 --> 01:34:04.320]   fonts and so forth there i collect programming fonts monotype fonts um where can i go to get good
[01:34:04.320 --> 01:34:09.520]   fonts um for free out of the name of this group well i mean google fonts is a great source and if you
[01:34:09.520 --> 01:34:15.280]   if you literally search on um i wish i could remember the name of this i'd compiled a list at one point
[01:34:15.280 --> 01:34:19.760]   uh but there are places that will list uh if you can find a place that lists google fonts and some
[01:34:19.760 --> 01:34:26.400]   other foundries you'll find lists of typefaces that are freely licenseable but designed you know in
[01:34:26.400 --> 01:34:32.080]   house essentially or designers contribute and uh they're often licensed for you know unlimited
[01:34:32.080 --> 01:34:37.760]   use or sometimes for non-commercial purposes but uh yeah if you find albert is in most places that's
[01:34:37.760 --> 01:34:43.920]   a copied version and um and it won't have the quality of it and uh actually a friend of mine
[01:34:43.920 --> 01:34:48.480]   followed became friends with because he did the new version of albert is for monotype uh
[01:34:48.480 --> 01:34:54.960]   toshio mcgary he developed a kind of revival version of albert is that is fantastic and comes in greek
[01:34:54.960 --> 01:35:00.800]   and rush a syrolic and uh has a little picture of its designer veritol vulpe is one of the characters
[01:35:00.800 --> 01:35:07.360]   it's very cool oh that's cool you have a drawing a favorite body type font oh gosh i'm i i am a big
[01:35:07.360 --> 01:35:14.160]   fan of minion have used a lot of minion too that's an adobe uh yeah that's from the 80s is roger slimback
[01:35:14.160 --> 01:35:21.440]   uh designed that and uh it's just an amazingly versatile typeface i use a lot of um i use bambo
[01:35:21.440 --> 01:35:24.080]   sometimes again that's that ain't that's a font that dates back to the
[01:35:24.080 --> 01:35:33.280]   dates back to the nero tamaki apolifally the uh a book printed in the 1400s uh about dreams um so
[01:35:33.280 --> 01:35:36.640]   there's a lot of yeah the lot of tafus is like that there's a great story you know about how this
[01:35:36.640 --> 01:35:42.960]   fellow in uh who i got to meet him when i was in london he figured out that uh well the 1910s this
[01:35:42.960 --> 01:35:48.720]   person who was slowly losing his mind had had a falling out with uh with uh he was a printer and
[01:35:48.720 --> 01:35:52.720]   nana falling out with his business partner and the business partner agreed to let the printer
[01:35:52.720 --> 01:35:58.000]   keep the typefaces and the punches from which they are made until uh some certain period of time i
[01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:02.800]   think until his death or something like that and so the guy is losing his mind slowly starts dumping
[01:36:02.800 --> 01:36:09.200]   all of the type into the tems he carries pounds of his pocket is beautiful font ever the dubs bible
[01:36:09.200 --> 01:36:16.320]   font oh it's incredible it is magnificent uh tom is cobden sanderson yes cobden sanderson and
[01:36:16.320 --> 01:36:20.160]   you can read his journals and you can see how the man it's really sad you're working with lead maybe
[01:36:20.160 --> 01:36:24.240]   he was having lead poisoning i don't know and then when it's all done he triumphantly announces that
[01:36:24.240 --> 01:36:30.160]   he dumped it all well so this fella robert green uh says well what if i could figure out where it was
[01:36:30.160 --> 01:36:36.960]   and he pinpoints where he thinks it is and he finds type and then he uh hires the divers from the
[01:36:36.960 --> 01:36:42.240]   city of london and they dive and they retrieve uh i don't hundred odd pieces i've been to his home
[01:36:42.240 --> 01:36:47.360]   and held some of the dove type in my hand and it's what a wonderful story now the funny part is i
[01:36:47.360 --> 01:36:53.920]   have found two maybe three other stories in which type has been thrown in a pit of it a pit of peak
[01:36:53.920 --> 01:37:01.040]   or as in despair into a body of waters i've designed our nutty people they are maybe it's the
[01:37:01.040 --> 01:37:05.680]   lead huh maybe it's the lead yeah i have a book i want to write called the lead heave in the lake i
[01:37:05.680 --> 01:37:12.640]   think something is bad is that i don't know deal if you look up dove bible you'll see what i think
[01:37:12.640 --> 01:37:16.400]   is the most gorgeous well there's a good and i'm showing it right now a good bbc
[01:37:16.400 --> 01:37:24.080]   uh news story on the whole recovery of the fonts and the yeah of the of the type and and all of that
[01:37:24.080 --> 01:37:29.200]   you can buy robert has a modern rendition he has spent so much time looking at the work of the dove
[01:37:29.200 --> 01:37:35.760]   press this is this is tell me if i'm wrong here this is derived from what is my favorite base font
[01:37:35.760 --> 01:37:42.080]   which is janssen that's right that's all it's a type is oh my god we have we have fallen into the
[01:37:42.080 --> 01:37:48.560]   type hole here yeah sorry this is what happens this what happens you know i love it i love it up here
[01:37:48.560 --> 01:37:53.840]   with type it's it's uh fast it's very nerdy but it's fascinating by the way if you go to glenn dot fun
[01:37:53.840 --> 01:37:59.600]   what is that font because that is a nice you've chosen a nice typeface for your what if i uh now
[01:37:59.600 --> 01:38:04.960]   you have to write i think it's uh now and of course the one typeface i don't know is the one that's
[01:38:04.960 --> 01:38:11.520]   on my own site the one you chose it is i have to load it and use my tool it's a very nice grotesque
[01:38:11.520 --> 01:38:18.240]   font it's moseo sand mose it's uh it's a modern typeface it comes in lots of weights and uh that's
[01:38:18.240 --> 01:38:22.640]   the other way you can do it too is if you have an adobe crea sis gonna sound like an ad it is not an
[01:38:22.640 --> 01:38:27.520]   ad it's not an ad if you have an adobe creative cloud subscription they include what we use to be
[01:38:27.520 --> 01:38:34.160]   a former service they bought type kit yeah and with type kit you get a like uh included you can use
[01:38:34.160 --> 01:38:38.400]   tons of fonts including as web fonts many of them are available so i have uh it linked to a bunch
[01:38:38.400 --> 01:38:44.640]   of sites is the asterisk here at dingbat or is it an actual the actual asterisk it's a Unicode
[01:38:44.640 --> 01:38:51.200]   character so it's a rendition in moseo sands of an eight pointed star and the funny part is one
[01:38:51.200 --> 01:38:56.000]   mobile it's a totally different character oh you want to talk about Unicode now i just oh you
[01:38:56.000 --> 01:39:03.600]   have code oh that's uh you know this is the greatest thing about being a nerd uh is or a geek is
[01:39:03.600 --> 01:39:08.720]   it doesn't matter what the topic is if we can dive deep and get some passion it's fascinating and
[01:39:08.720 --> 01:39:15.120]   i love i love going down that rabbit hole so much so much fun there's such great characters in
[01:39:15.120 --> 01:39:19.520]   in the font world it's you'd be you'd be surprised that that story glenn just told was my very favorite
[01:39:19.520 --> 01:39:25.200]   it's gonna be the only i never go ahead glenn i know you study this formally you you know you're
[01:39:25.200 --> 01:39:30.720]   actually a designer and you've and you've you've actually you've says in your web page the last
[01:39:30.720 --> 01:39:36.240]   a person ever apprenticed as a typesetter in the world i may be exaggerating but pretty close
[01:39:36.240 --> 01:39:41.120]   feels like last generation the only thing i know as in this a wonderful book i've recommended many
[01:39:41.120 --> 01:39:47.440]   many times it stops stealing sheep oh yeah eric speaker man yeah yeah i was just funny i just
[01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:52.320]   was exchanging tweets with him on uh on the twitter machine it's why part of why i know him is because
[01:39:52.320 --> 01:39:57.680]   of twitter uh fantastic designer typeface designer very interesting guy i have a giant book if you
[01:39:57.680 --> 01:40:03.680]   look behind me oh it's too low below it's a book called uh what is it hello i am eric and it's about
[01:40:03.680 --> 01:40:08.800]   it's written about him uh very interesting cat i like this book so much apparently i've purchased
[01:40:08.800 --> 01:40:14.320]   it twice according to amazon i don't know why maybe that was as a gift i don't know that's good
[01:40:14.320 --> 01:40:19.120]   he's been eric developed this way of doing what he calls digital letterpress as he uses a
[01:40:19.120 --> 01:40:24.480]   a modern machine that makes plates from digital files in a very particular way he had to spend
[01:40:24.480 --> 01:40:32.160]   sixty thousand euros to modify an off-the-shelf device and then he can print on a an a letterpress
[01:40:32.160 --> 01:40:37.920]   on a automated like motorized sort of one of the last modern letterpresses these very high quality
[01:40:37.920 --> 01:40:42.880]   books uh so he's done of you know relatively small series but uh i have a few of them and they are
[01:40:42.880 --> 01:40:48.000]   they are absolutely letterpress they feel like it but they're this interesting hybrid between old
[01:40:48.000 --> 01:40:52.560]   and new and i mean that still has the bite fun yeah yeah it's the bite it's very black ink because
[01:40:52.560 --> 01:40:57.040]   letterpress ink is often much blacker than the they can use with offset because of the way it
[01:40:57.040 --> 01:41:01.280]   applies to paper and anyway it's the intersection between that old and new that i think is the most
[01:41:01.280 --> 01:41:05.600]   fun is there's a lot of stuff that's you know vr and ar is totally new and it's its own beast but
[01:41:05.600 --> 01:41:10.880]   where you can hit physical and digital things together i just think you know 2d printing and 3d
[01:41:10.880 --> 01:41:16.640]   of 3d cutting and 3 printing that kind of thing somebody in our irc chat has discovered
[01:41:16.640 --> 01:41:21.120]   the Unicode for the eight pointed star and put it in our irc chat
[01:41:21.120 --> 01:41:26.960]   if you had a client that does Unicode it really looks good it's nice i had a look at
[01:41:26.960 --> 01:41:32.880]   myself warning is why ios it looks like a weird it's a little weird it's like a little starburst
[01:41:32.880 --> 01:41:37.680]   instead of this beautiful thing that's too bad desktop browser it's really nice yeah
[01:41:37.680 --> 01:41:41.120]   Unicode every every platform a new a new experience
[01:41:41.120 --> 01:41:49.760]   google did not have a very good quarter it's interesting we were talking on windows weekly
[01:41:49.760 --> 01:41:55.360]   about microsoft which had an excellent quarter and and you know lots to celebrate until
[01:41:55.360 --> 01:42:01.040]   paul mentioned but by the way with google's terrible quarter their revenue far exceeded
[01:42:01.040 --> 01:42:06.480]   the total revenue of microsoft their revenue in advertising alone so you have to put a little
[01:42:06.480 --> 01:42:15.600]   bit in perspective um the it's google said it may be the war i don't know but digital ad sales
[01:42:15.600 --> 01:42:21.440]   down too white a bit was heard him badly and so that may be tick tock maybe from tick tock youtube
[01:42:21.440 --> 01:42:27.680]   ad revenue which analysts had thought would increase 25 percent only increased 14 percent see
[01:42:27.680 --> 01:42:34.240]   this is the problem with this it's a miss but it's not a drop it's it's a lot it's yeah it's still a lot
[01:42:34.240 --> 01:42:40.880]   it apples uh when apple stuck in the do not uh track me it could be it could be part of the
[01:42:40.880 --> 01:42:45.200]   two although i think youtube suffers less than that because they feed people their first person
[01:42:45.200 --> 01:42:50.960]   so first parties in fact benefit from apples att because att means you can't
[01:42:50.960 --> 01:42:56.720]   track people as a third party google doesn't need to go back totally true go on the first party
[01:42:56.720 --> 01:43:00.800]   they're the first party for everything you do although i thought it was interesting after all
[01:43:00.800 --> 01:43:05.920]   the time we've talked we had richard gingress on to talk about google amp jeff uh you know i was
[01:43:05.920 --> 01:43:12.400]   not a big fan uh jeff tried to explain why was a good thing google's amp seems to be now losing
[01:43:12.400 --> 01:43:19.040]   ground it's over yeah yeah which is surprising well because you know and and and find you can
[01:43:19.040 --> 01:43:23.680]   complain about what i was there when when it was first discussed with the newspaper industry
[01:43:23.680 --> 01:43:28.640]   and the news industry and one of the google executives who was there not richard just said
[01:43:28.640 --> 01:43:32.080]   you guys have never got to trust us to do this yeah you need that's what happened
[01:43:32.080 --> 01:43:35.120]   but you're not going to trust it and that's what happened they tried to make an open source but it
[01:43:35.120 --> 01:43:41.200]   never fully was but the truth underlying was still the case media companies effed up the web
[01:43:41.200 --> 01:43:46.320]   miserably through all kinds of that's true editorially plus the ad departments and the
[01:43:46.320 --> 01:43:52.560]   technology department is just just horrible slow miserable rotten irritating pages so there was a
[01:43:52.560 --> 01:43:59.360]   need for an amp uh it just that wasn't the beside it to be had and i think that generally people had
[01:43:59.360 --> 01:44:04.320]   the attitude i was just like a land grab from google uh it just and it doesn't really wasn't
[01:44:04.320 --> 01:44:07.920]   because it wasn't that's the thing people assume google was these land grabs they got plenty of
[01:44:07.920 --> 01:44:13.680]   land right like they don't need dues they don't need to happen they got they got plenty of land but
[01:44:13.680 --> 01:44:17.440]   it's not it's all the problem for google i think it didn't solve enough of a problem for anybody
[01:44:17.440 --> 01:44:21.040]   else or the truth or the truth well and that was the real problem was yeah that the newspapers
[01:44:21.040 --> 01:44:26.800]   weren't seeing the revenue uh it was hiding who was looking at their stuff google was getting all
[01:44:26.800 --> 01:44:32.480]   that information not the newspapers uh youtube advertising revenue six point eight seven billion
[01:44:32.480 --> 01:44:38.880]   dollars uh wall streets mad because they thought it would be more sounds like it's yeah per quarter
[01:44:38.880 --> 01:44:44.160]   yeah that's important to say per quarter and they were fools to abot it for what was it one point
[01:44:44.160 --> 01:44:49.760]   six bills yeah yeah no it's definitely generating uh for them they've started they've announced they're
[01:44:49.760 --> 01:44:54.880]   gonna start putting ads on the youtube what do they call it the shorts the their their
[01:44:54.880 --> 01:45:01.120]   competition with tiktok which new thing yes they're tiktok and it confirms i think what some of
[01:45:01.120 --> 01:45:08.880]   what you just said which is tiktok must be hurting them a little bit um add growth revenue slowing but
[01:45:08.880 --> 01:45:19.440]   not shrinking uh you google told shareholders youtube shorts is doing great don't worry about tiktok
[01:45:19.920 --> 01:45:26.720]   it's not all about tiktok um let's see that was a headline from tech crunch
[01:45:26.720 --> 01:45:32.400]   Ruth poor at the cfo said the slower rate of growth is more a reflection of last year's
[01:45:32.400 --> 01:45:38.320]   unprecedented gains that may be true too i mean even netflix which had a terrible quarter
[01:45:38.320 --> 01:45:44.480]   but that was coming off of a gigantic growth through pandemic maybe that's the maybe that's
[01:45:44.480 --> 01:45:53.120]   the thing ad revenue in 2021 q1 had increased 49 percent on youtube that's all people
[01:45:53.120 --> 01:45:59.680]   reality is now competing with uh youtube is uh you know real things go into concert halls we can go
[01:45:59.680 --> 01:46:05.280]   out uh see people so yeah right right that too competition from reality hurts youtube revenues
[01:46:05.280 --> 01:46:11.520]   that's a good headline there i i hardly used youtube i felt like for general viewing uh before
[01:46:11.520 --> 01:46:15.920]   the pandemic and now i feel like it's kind of the first stop uh that we put on the agenda
[01:46:15.920 --> 01:46:20.880]   partly because we watch a lot of uk tv shows that are available through it but also it just um it
[01:46:20.880 --> 01:46:25.360]   has gotten to know us maybe a little too well although my 15 year and i you're you're holding
[01:46:25.360 --> 01:46:30.160]   i joke all the time we're watching something last night and the ads that threw up were like i don't
[01:46:30.160 --> 01:46:35.760]   need that medication we're not investing in that we don't buy cars like that they and we're like oh
[01:46:35.760 --> 01:46:40.160]   this is good youtube completely doesn't know who we are like whatever they're doing for personalization
[01:46:40.160 --> 01:46:45.040]   they've got us you know i find interesting they're glenn that's exactly the same ads i get get on
[01:46:45.040 --> 01:46:52.960]   cnn so it's the same advertisers big pharma it's automotive and actually in a way that's a real
[01:46:52.960 --> 01:46:58.560]   story because for a long time digital and i know this from podcasting was looked down upon by brand
[01:46:58.560 --> 01:47:04.800]   advertisers they said oh no you can't do brand advertising on digital yeah it's scale yeah
[01:47:04.800 --> 01:47:09.760]   so by the way back to your point though about youtube there's there's a paper that just came
[01:47:09.760 --> 01:47:17.360]   out from colleagues at cuny by the way and others um that debunks the the youtube rabbit hole
[01:47:17.360 --> 01:47:25.920]   argument and says that the worst stuff is is viewed little by few people and they come to it not
[01:47:25.920 --> 01:47:32.000]   from the algorithm they come to it from outside links it's just a serving platform for the for the
[01:47:32.000 --> 01:47:38.960]   far right which is interesting too yeah i don't know
[01:47:38.960 --> 01:47:46.800]   research facts oh yeah that's i know is that facts i don't know
[01:47:46.800 --> 01:47:55.440]   um researchers okay gee must be true uh uh well it's better yeah i mean my empirical research is
[01:47:55.440 --> 01:48:01.120]   google's best known for bikini rich content but that's just me well that's your problem i never
[01:48:01.120 --> 01:48:06.080]   see any of that i don't know what you're watching this oh hey by the way by the way this is i'm
[01:48:06.080 --> 01:48:12.080]   serious about this so the last week people have been talking about how there's porn on twitter
[01:48:12.080 --> 01:48:17.840]   i have never seen any porn on twitter does it think i'm presbyterian still you just have to look for
[01:48:17.840 --> 01:48:25.040]   it they don't stop it they don't stop it so you have to uh that's actually that that there's a really
[01:48:25.040 --> 01:48:30.640]   good example of why twitter works you follow who you want to follow i've never seen an inch of
[01:48:30.640 --> 01:48:38.880]   bear flesh on twitter well i'll send you a list no it only comes up in if you search for certain
[01:48:38.880 --> 01:48:43.840]   things and i think flong is one of them by the way you'll get a letter to that okay it seems like
[01:48:43.840 --> 01:48:49.920]   innocuous terms and then flong means something in the togolog i think because i see it come up and
[01:48:49.920 --> 01:48:54.160]   post from people from the philippines and i'm like i don't know what flong means but it's not what i
[01:48:54.160 --> 01:48:58.480]   think well and that's an interesting you know elan says free speech right well pornography is
[01:48:58.480 --> 01:49:05.120]   protected by free speech spam is protected by free speech uh a lot of things that elan may not
[01:49:05.120 --> 01:49:12.400]   want on his platform are protected by free speech so it's a very uh you know tumblr got rid of the
[01:49:12.400 --> 01:49:20.480]   porn because i mean heard it immensely because it wasn't really important it was alternative creation
[01:49:20.480 --> 01:49:24.560]   that's the problem well interpreted as well i mean it was there were you know you could go and find
[01:49:24.560 --> 01:49:30.400]   naked pictures of people i mean if that's what i really like it was for i don't know yeah it's a
[01:49:30.400 --> 01:49:35.440]   if you if you look at where the sex workers go you can see what's going on with the platform because
[01:49:35.440 --> 01:49:42.560]   they're the least tolerated people on the planet and so when a platform uh you know so it's you
[01:49:42.560 --> 01:49:46.800]   think they might start with Nazis and fascists and people who want to overthrow governments and
[01:49:46.800 --> 01:49:52.000]   commit violence but they usually start with sex workers and trans people and people who lack a
[01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:56.320]   strong political voice in the country in which they're in which they live and you know so that's
[01:49:56.320 --> 01:50:00.160]   a good sex workers are always the canary in the keloland's like we have to stop this problem so
[01:50:00.160 --> 01:50:07.440]   we're going to ban uh sex workers and that will fix our platform and hurt the sex workers every time
[01:50:07.440 --> 01:50:12.960]   that's right the back end of the arms of of pimps and make their lives worse so like the back page
[01:50:12.960 --> 01:50:16.560]   thing like all these things that are they're ostensibly they're all about their puritanism as
[01:50:16.560 --> 01:50:21.040]   opposed to providing if they're you know if to provide other opportunities people if you want to
[01:50:21.040 --> 01:50:26.160]   do things you don't you don't ban them from a platform in order to protect them but it tells us
[01:50:26.160 --> 01:50:29.520]   what else is coming on a platform because it's always first the weakest people with the least
[01:50:29.520 --> 01:50:33.920]   voice and who will defend them the least well so then upwards from there well isn't the congress
[01:50:33.920 --> 01:50:39.280]   now looking at essentially a return of uh uh uh uh sauston fest i'm trying to remember what the
[01:50:39.280 --> 01:50:43.920]   uh yeah i think there's it's always simmering there because it's very easy to sell your constituents
[01:50:43.920 --> 01:50:48.000]   that you're doing something if you tell them you're banning people from something yeah i mean this
[01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:53.040]   is why all there's been all the cries of pedophilia and grooming and so forth this is a very emotional
[01:50:53.040 --> 01:50:57.760]   appeal and right uh you know and who's there who's for that nobody's for that yeah yeah he's right it's
[01:50:57.760 --> 01:51:02.240]   a very easy i'm i'm not a you know but you know if you're old enough as we are and you remember the
[01:51:02.240 --> 01:51:08.400]   satanism panic of the uh eighties uh this is a replay of that just that is incredibly magnified scale but
[01:51:08.400 --> 01:51:13.440]   it's exactly the same playbook and exactly is ridiculous it was it was daycare right they everybody
[01:51:13.440 --> 01:51:17.760]   thought this yeah yeah people they're eating babies and i'm like show where are the babies who are
[01:51:17.760 --> 01:51:22.400]   missing yeah they're the babies who are like who's babies exactly where yeah this is you know i did
[01:51:22.400 --> 01:51:25.840]   this piece for boingboing a few years ago because people were throwing around a number about human
[01:51:25.840 --> 01:51:30.080]   trafficking and if you dig into the numbers they said there's x hundreds of thousands of children go
[01:51:30.080 --> 01:51:34.720]   missing a year when you look at the numbers missing can be as little as four hours it can be that
[01:51:34.720 --> 01:51:38.800]   somebody didn't come home at the time expected it was reported briefly and when you dig down to
[01:51:38.800 --> 01:51:44.000]   it there are something like under 200 incidents a year in which a child was missing because a
[01:51:44.000 --> 01:51:48.320]   stranger is involved it's almost always people they know almost always close family members
[01:51:48.320 --> 01:51:54.080]   often a custodial dispute or they got lost at school long or a parent didn't realize they were out
[01:51:54.080 --> 01:51:58.720]   and so we have this incredible national panic you know laura skanese he's been a great
[01:51:58.720 --> 01:52:03.360]   voice on that and she's uh i think libertarian maybe in focus but she she's a very interesting
[01:52:03.360 --> 01:52:07.840]   person always loved her npr commentary uh i mean she's been a great voice for the and she did that
[01:52:07.840 --> 01:52:14.000]   tv series even the reality show about uh how do you get parents to understand the actual risk
[01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:19.920]   instead of these risks that poke up but it's so easy so primal to say my child could get hurt
[01:52:19.920 --> 01:52:25.360]   there are 600 000 children go missing each year footnote well really it's only you know 200 or
[01:52:25.360 --> 01:52:29.200]   something right and you listen to that top number and you keep your children indoors but look at the
[01:52:29.200 --> 01:52:34.960]   long-term consequences kids don't play outside anymore because they're stranger danger uh you know
[01:52:34.960 --> 01:52:39.520]   why i saw some kids playing outside the other day i was stunned we used to we give our kids a
[01:52:39.520 --> 01:52:43.840]   we give our kids a box a broken glass just like my parents gave me yeah and we put them in the back
[01:52:43.840 --> 01:52:48.480]   seat and drive around yeah i don't know what you're yeah and what about the razor blades in the apples
[01:52:48.480 --> 01:52:53.040]   on halloween night i got a ask you that's my favorite that's my favorite my parents would go to
[01:52:53.040 --> 01:52:57.920]   parties and we would my sister and i would sleep in the back of the station wagon unlocked parked out
[01:52:57.920 --> 01:53:02.960]   front right while they drank and then drove home after uh if you bark at it and there were no seat
[01:53:02.960 --> 01:53:07.520]   belts oh there's a there were driving with they're driving with a drink in one end and a cigarette
[01:53:07.520 --> 01:53:14.000]   the other end using the elbows to steer yeah car like i we came out we're fine yeah we survived
[01:53:14.000 --> 01:53:18.400]   oh no it's yeah there is the the balance i unfortunately i live in seattle which you think it was a pretty
[01:53:18.400 --> 01:53:23.440]   calm city and we didn't let our kids play outside much because we were near we're in kind of a fairly
[01:53:23.440 --> 01:53:28.720]   residential part of seattle and the streets are too dangerous for from cars we honestly that's the
[01:53:28.720 --> 01:53:35.760]   biggest for me the biggest threat to humanity is it's for so many reasons as cars for so many
[01:53:35.760 --> 01:53:40.080]   safer in the street we would let our kids run free if the if the roads the people that didn't drive
[01:53:40.080 --> 01:53:45.360]   you know in our our 25 mile an hour of a chair we're very excited in san francisco and jeff i know
[01:53:45.360 --> 01:53:51.760]   you joe jf k boulevard through golden gate park unbelievably in a very controversial vote
[01:53:51.760 --> 01:53:56.640]   they just voted to close it to automotive traffic forever oh my gosh that's fantastic huge
[01:53:56.640 --> 01:54:04.720]   yeah uh and uh it was extremely controversial it leads all the way through you know golden gate park
[01:54:04.720 --> 01:54:09.440]   incredibly it will make the park a hundred times better for roller skaters bicyclists
[01:54:09.440 --> 01:54:14.720]   the pedestrians the people out there absolutely will we have a long stretch in seattle uh lake
[01:54:14.720 --> 01:54:19.680]   wash and boulevard that they close in the summer at certain points for biking only days and during
[01:54:19.680 --> 01:54:24.640]   the pandemic they put on all these safe streets where they closed off city streets except for local
[01:54:24.640 --> 01:54:28.480]   residents and set you know put bumps in and so forth and they've been doing incredible traffic
[01:54:28.480 --> 01:54:33.680]   calming and i just think that you know it it hasn't because of the reduced traffic volume we have
[01:54:33.680 --> 01:54:38.480]   which may be forever maybe we i mean not it won't not that it won't ever go back up but that's what
[01:54:38.480 --> 01:54:44.560]   happened we all saw how great it was in pandemic right right if 25 percent of workers are now
[01:54:44.560 --> 01:54:49.280]   working from home one to five days a week it would stay that way yeah if you don't need as much maybe
[01:54:49.280 --> 01:54:54.960]   we'll become the Netherlands yeah oh wouldn't that be nice i want to ride my bike everywhere i really
[01:54:54.960 --> 01:55:00.640]   do and it's too dangerous i'm too scared to i just don't dare you have driven it to your to the
[01:55:00.640 --> 01:55:06.560]   street i used to ride a work until uh i saw a ghost bike on the bridge that i cross over every
[01:55:06.560 --> 01:55:13.680]   time a guy got squished uh it was broad daylight a driver a elderly driver who was on meds
[01:55:13.680 --> 01:55:20.000]   veered over crushed the guy on the bridge there's very little bike path there so it is a very dangerous
[01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:25.600]   crossing point i saw that ghost bike i said and i haven't ridden my bike since oh i'm sorry it breaks
[01:55:25.600 --> 01:55:32.800]   my heart i love it uh i is my hope that in my i know i only have a few years left but in my lifetime
[01:55:32.800 --> 01:55:39.680]   we might be able to get rid of personal car ownership so i can ride my bike when i am 90 i am hoping
[01:55:39.680 --> 01:55:47.600]   i am praying uh google says so narpichai says the pixel phone is pixel six is the fastest-selling
[01:55:47.600 --> 01:55:56.000]   pixel ever which is faint price indeed yes they also said that and this is probably of more interest
[01:55:56.000 --> 01:56:03.280]   and maybe you had to help the stock price uh they are going to do a 70 billion dollar buyback of alphabet
[01:56:03.280 --> 01:56:10.240]   stock so before or after the split uh let me see they didn't say when they were gonna do it so is
[01:56:10.240 --> 01:56:15.920]   this the split happen oh maybe it's that already yeah i hate buybacks buybacks are the worst the worst
[01:56:15.920 --> 01:56:22.480]   i agree well shareholders like it because uh you know it increases their value but it does kind of
[01:56:22.480 --> 01:56:26.880]   obscure the real value of a of a company with antitrust going after them what can they buy
[01:56:26.880 --> 01:56:30.640]   they're not going to get them in trouble yes apple has done very well with its stock i mean
[01:56:30.640 --> 01:56:34.880]   look at apple stock uh because they have a huge trove of cash and they've got nothing better to do
[01:56:34.880 --> 01:56:41.520]   with it so they buy back there shares 70 billion dollars um alphabet purchased more of its own stock
[01:56:41.520 --> 01:56:48.000]   than any other public company last year except for apple uh so it was apple google or amster alphabet
[01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:52.720]   and then met agree with clan that's those resources could build they could build that next twitter
[01:56:52.720 --> 01:56:58.800]   they could they could give us back why is it okay so it's bad because you should put it into rnd is
[01:56:58.800 --> 01:57:02.960]   that why it's bad yeah it's not it's not productive it does it does reward shareholders but you could
[01:57:02.960 --> 01:57:06.800]   do you know you could do a special dividend if you wanted to reward shareholders instead of
[01:57:06.800 --> 01:57:12.320]   trying to i mean they're always playing games with uh stock price because even though stock price
[01:57:12.320 --> 01:57:18.240]   you know if apple stock were a thousand dollars a share it shouldn't be it's the stock shouldn't go
[01:57:18.240 --> 01:57:23.280]   up if there's a stock split and it does right that's the weird part of yeah shareholders yeah
[01:57:23.280 --> 01:57:27.760]   stock market's not rational necessarily so that's part of it so they so that's part of it as well
[01:57:27.760 --> 01:57:33.280]   as they want to increase they'd like to uh tweak their uh you know tweak their numbers by having
[01:57:33.280 --> 01:57:39.120]   less outstanding share fewer outstanding shares facebook shares also spiked on better than expected
[01:57:39.120 --> 01:57:45.280]   quarterly earnings uh the stock uh nobody expected anything from facebook anything it's gonna be
[01:57:45.280 --> 01:57:53.120]   awful yeah look at that look at that the intraday jump um 18 percent in extended trading today Jesus
[01:57:53.120 --> 01:57:58.720]   earnings top estimates revenue disappointing though again this is beating that all you have to do is
[01:57:58.720 --> 01:58:04.160]   beat the analyst estimates in your end everybody's happy earnings per share 272 versus two dollars
[01:58:04.160 --> 01:58:14.240]   and fifty six cents expected revenue 27.91 billion versus 28.2 daily active users 1.96 billion almost
[01:58:14.240 --> 01:58:23.840]   there almost so close to two monthly active users 2.94 billion arpoo which everybody talks about now
[01:58:23.840 --> 01:58:30.240]   arpoo which is the average revenue per user nine dollars and fifty four cents which also beat the
[01:58:30.240 --> 01:58:38.800]   street yeah so good news for uh meta i'm having a hard time calling it alphabet and meta yeah i'm
[01:58:38.800 --> 01:58:43.840]   too all right just you don't want to call uh square block now or something block and uh of
[01:58:43.840 --> 01:58:52.720]   course jack's title is block head block head i am the block head the head of block we'd like to give
[01:58:52.720 --> 01:58:57.600]   us something to talk about the issue with meta i think as it always is is that they make their
[01:58:57.600 --> 01:59:02.080]   arpoo is a great number to look at if you dig it out or dig out to the regional numbers they make
[01:59:02.080 --> 01:59:09.360]   a lot of money from people in north america a bit of money from people in europe and a lot of
[01:59:09.360 --> 01:59:14.000]   nothing i mean very very little from people in the rest of the world and they don't seem to have
[01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:18.160]   been able to improve that over time it remains kind of in that division so their growth has to
[01:59:18.160 --> 01:59:23.200]   come from markets that are smaller and more fully established and you know that's going to be
[01:59:23.200 --> 01:59:26.960]   their long-term problem especially as they have this you know the negative pressure against
[01:59:26.960 --> 01:59:32.800]   advertising against how they're governed uh sharlesandberg gets charlesandberg personally i think
[01:59:32.800 --> 01:59:40.000]   and succuburg unlike twitter facebook has classes of shares though you know so zuckerberg can never
[01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:44.560]   he can ever lose control of facebook twitter has no classes of share i looked this up when musk
[01:59:44.560 --> 01:59:49.280]   was talking about tatie and jim it's so funny that he said that i did this well as most they did not
[01:59:49.280 --> 01:59:52.800]   build the company that way they built it well i think i i think classes of shares for publicly
[01:59:52.800 --> 01:59:58.720]   held companies without very specific rules should be uh not within the regulations because of it
[01:59:58.720 --> 02:00:03.680]   doesn't give sharled as a way to influence or change you know the direction of a company ever it feels
[02:00:03.680 --> 02:00:07.360]   like it's we're going to give you we're going to give you some shares in the company we're not
[02:00:07.360 --> 02:00:12.080]   asking for your opinion though yeah we we just want you know you could participate in our success but
[02:00:12.080 --> 02:00:16.880]   don't tell us what to do your votes are worth one tenth of ours or twenty if but we
[02:00:16.880 --> 02:00:21.760]   googled us that too afibet did that as well yeah it's a good strategy for the founders that's who
[02:00:21.760 --> 02:00:29.520]   does it it's great when we met last one week ago we were saying oh boy it's too bad about cnn plus
[02:00:29.520 --> 02:00:37.840]   uh well boy the next day it closed almost as fast it almost went down as fast as quippy maybe
[02:00:37.840 --> 02:00:43.440]   faster actually i think it's a very it's it's uh somebody said it was eight scare mochis uh it was
[02:00:43.440 --> 02:00:49.520]   very quick you'll really bad for them because i do too i don't i don't have it's like there's a
[02:00:49.520 --> 02:00:54.400]   lot of there's a lot of media sites and media companies and everything that you know i might
[02:00:54.400 --> 02:00:58.720]   have the of negative about like do i want them to succeed do i think cnn i'm pretty neutral about i
[02:00:58.720 --> 02:01:03.040]   think they do good reporting they're interesting and they hired interesting people a lot of people
[02:01:03.040 --> 02:01:08.080]   stake their careers i'm moving i'm changing jobs that's where i feel bad is yeah it's like you're
[02:01:08.080 --> 02:01:11.760]   not as a corporate then and then it's but but you understand the time i kept reading the timeline
[02:01:11.760 --> 02:01:16.720]   like how did this happen it's like oh because they were they were actually unlike any line musk
[02:01:16.720 --> 02:01:22.960]   allegedly they were completely scrupulous about not talking during the period before the merger
[02:01:22.960 --> 02:01:27.360]   closed when they weren't supposed to talk about significant business stuff they call it done jumping
[02:01:27.360 --> 02:01:33.920]   godly enough and they didn't they did they did the right thing and everyone involved in it did the
[02:01:33.920 --> 02:01:38.800]   right thing and to cnn they should have launched that service before the merger because they had
[02:01:38.800 --> 02:01:43.280]   invested in it and it was a smart long-term move that they couldn't predict but
[02:01:43.280 --> 02:01:47.200]   discovery didn't want him to do it discovery couldn't tell them that
[02:01:47.200 --> 02:01:52.880]   uh but the minute discovery comes in looks at the financials they said okay now you're closing it
[02:01:52.880 --> 02:01:58.000]   yeah uh yeah it's very it's very sad for the the personnel involved
[02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:03.840]   cn is trying to find a place for a lot of them i'm sure chris wallis will land on his feet i'm not
[02:02:03.840 --> 02:02:08.560]   exactly crying for him i think he'll have a problem no but uh a lot of great news yeah
[02:02:08.720 --> 02:02:16.800]   yeah a lot of producers a lot of talent um and uh i think also when you looked at cnn plus
[02:02:16.800 --> 02:02:23.520]   and saw that there was no live news it was like well why would i want that i mean as just purely
[02:02:23.520 --> 02:02:29.440]   as a customer yeah there wasn't a lot there but i guess they you know but they they promoted it so
[02:02:29.440 --> 02:02:34.240]   much and hadn't built out a a service i mean honestly isn't that the fox news plus whatever
[02:02:34.240 --> 02:02:38.080]   they call it it's pretty thin too there's only a few original shows and a lot of these things
[02:02:38.080 --> 02:02:43.200]   either yeah i i've not i've not been a subscriber i've read about people have subscribed to test it out
[02:02:43.200 --> 02:02:47.040]   but a lot of the news services seem to be kind of thin and i don't know who their audience well
[02:02:47.040 --> 02:02:51.280]   they we've talked about this of course they don't want to offend the msos the cable operators
[02:02:51.280 --> 02:02:58.720]   or their bread and butter so they cannot you know cannibalize the real product uh even though streaming
[02:02:58.720 --> 02:03:04.560]   is the future um and they know it so they're kind of it's it's kind of what planning a flag
[02:03:04.560 --> 02:03:09.440]   it's uh putting a bookmark thing will be here wall fetishism though it's also everybody's got to
[02:03:09.440 --> 02:03:14.720]   have a pay wall and sorry not all of you are worth the pay wall i think discovery actually is correct
[02:03:14.720 --> 02:03:19.840]   and saying look we're gonna have hbo max it's gonna be everything because people don't want five
[02:03:19.840 --> 02:03:24.480]   different streaming services i agree we're gonna make one that does it all and i you know i think
[02:03:24.480 --> 02:03:29.520]   they'll put live news on hbo max i betcha uh and that'll be something you'll want
[02:03:29.520 --> 02:03:34.240]   plus all the other stuff which sounds great somebody who is a big winner oddly enough somebody
[02:03:34.240 --> 02:03:45.120]   you all know very well Christina Warren NPR story NPR story about Christina she collects swag from

[02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:05.440]   people you plug it in it more when its ears would move it's very strange look like a rabbit oh lord

[02:05:13.440 --> 02:05:18.000]   wow wow that's pretty cool wow
[02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:25.280]   uh let's see i think we can wrap it up is there but there are about a three thousand stories in this
[02:05:25.280 --> 02:05:33.440]   tier that we didn't do but i mean we had a big thing to talk about google rose out a new
[02:05:33.440 --> 02:05:37.520]   cookie cookie rejection banner in europe clearly fed up as most of us are
[02:05:37.520 --> 02:05:45.360]   with with this uh jeez louise so now they did a redesign after years of pressure from data
[02:05:45.360 --> 02:05:54.400]   protection watchdogs the new banner uh will basically say no don't screw it all turn off all
[02:05:54.400 --> 02:05:59.120]   cookies is a big screw button on the big middle of the road is it you're saying soon anybody's
[02:05:59.120 --> 02:06:03.120]   visiting search in youtube and europe while signed out or incognito mode will see a new
[02:06:03.120 --> 02:06:09.520]   cookie consent choice uh it'll start in france then be extended to the uh rest of the eu as well as
[02:06:09.520 --> 02:06:16.960]   uk and switzerland um and i've seen we're starting to see like in fact we have passive aggressive
[02:06:16.960 --> 02:06:24.160]   uh cookie banners saying things like what i saw on the other days oh it was hysterical it's
[02:06:24.160 --> 02:06:31.280]   something like yeah we have cookies what about it you want a piece of me yeah come and get me
[02:06:31.280 --> 02:06:36.480]   okay and then you have to press okay right that's all you have to do i notice that ad blockers are
[02:06:36.480 --> 02:06:42.160]   failing because uh on a lot of sites that they used to say uh disable your ad blocker and continue
[02:06:42.160 --> 02:06:46.560]   there's a button on the bottom it's a little bit of a dark pattern and it says continue without ad
[02:06:46.560 --> 02:06:52.080]   blocker and you click continue without ad blocker and it just goes to the site and i only you know i
[02:06:52.080 --> 02:06:57.360]   try to use it sparingly because i support i want sites that are ad-supported to make money from me
[02:06:57.360 --> 02:07:03.440]   i turn it on on sites that my browser crashes or they're auto-playing video and i try really try
[02:07:03.440 --> 02:07:09.440]   to customize and i try not to be yeah so i only do it an extremist and uh and the one i have will
[02:07:09.440 --> 02:07:13.760]   let ads through that are good ads that aren't like trying to do stuff to me so when that comes up i'm
[02:07:13.760 --> 02:07:17.760]   like come on i want to give you i want to give you my eyeballs okay my eyeballs don't turn
[02:07:17.760 --> 02:07:24.640]   out of my face please this is a story i actually haven't done yet but uh i feel safe doing it
[02:07:24.640 --> 02:07:31.600]   with you guys jeff javis glenn flashments great to have you both uh there's a lot of what going on
[02:07:31.600 --> 02:07:38.560]   in this piece oh man so the wall street journal has a piece saying meta there are
[02:07:38.560 --> 02:07:44.720]   genomies sharryl sandberg pressured the daily mail another mordock product right am i right no
[02:07:44.720 --> 02:07:51.200]   no no no no another mordock competitor okay to drop the reporting on bobby kodick who's the
[02:07:51.200 --> 02:07:57.360]   ceo of activation blizzard activation uh and i guess she was dating katik at the time
[02:07:57.360 --> 02:08:06.080]   so uh part of a campaign to persuade the tabloid to shell shelvin article exposing katik of course
[02:08:06.080 --> 02:08:15.120]   who is right now in a lot of uh hot water over uh harassment at uh activation um in 2016 and 2019
[02:08:15.120 --> 02:08:20.400]   see this is why i didn't want to do this story because it's but it's true right but is it a hit
[02:08:20.400 --> 02:08:24.960]   piece from mordock i don't know yeah you can't yeah yeah i mean they're all the player all the
[02:08:24.960 --> 02:08:30.160]   characters here particularly the media players i mean everybody's entangled yeah yeah you've got
[02:08:30.160 --> 02:08:34.720]   fleas you've got fleas on them okay so there you go i've read the story you can read it if you want
[02:08:34.720 --> 02:08:39.280]   to know more but this is really important now in this media landscape you have to look at it and
[02:08:39.280 --> 02:08:44.160]   say well it's the journal it's owned by mordock is a vida who has what that's too bad that we have
[02:08:44.160 --> 02:08:49.440]   to do that now i would well this is why i don't like must find twitter i don't want bezos to own the
[02:08:49.440 --> 02:08:56.400]   post i love it that these people are patrons of good journalism i don't want them to run the shop
[02:08:56.400 --> 02:09:01.840]   though some of the the the infamous washington uh a washington the infamous wall street journal
[02:09:01.840 --> 02:09:10.640]   editorial page is all gung ho on guess who buying twitter they like the idea sure i love it of course
[02:09:10.640 --> 02:09:14.080]   they do uh but you know what the ultimate this is i don't want to go back to musk you know the
[02:09:14.080 --> 02:09:19.840]   ultimate thing would be he buys twitter the deal goes through and then he says i'm not bringing
[02:09:19.840 --> 02:09:25.520]   you back at all you all suck and and everyone all would be the best troll for him to just to not
[02:09:25.520 --> 02:09:31.200]   be re-enable those folks to come i think the chances of that are as close to zero is possible
[02:09:31.200 --> 02:09:35.440]   now there's zero there's zero point would be a great let's convince the people let the man
[02:09:35.440 --> 02:09:40.880]   dream dream unglend dream we'll do a twitter poll because uh he's in a metaverse let him be there
[02:09:40.880 --> 02:09:50.240]   it's okay uh i think we have done uh everything we need to do uh anything i want to talk more about
[02:09:50.240 --> 02:09:55.440]   typefaces to be honest with you but uh i don't think the audience will tolerate a bit more
[02:09:55.440 --> 02:10:01.840]   of that but what you know and here's my proposal we will have glenn back very very soon you're just
[02:10:01.840 --> 02:10:07.360]   great moment i i i i pleasure have you ever been on any of our shows i you know now you this is
[02:10:07.360 --> 02:10:10.640]   going to be the funniest question you ever asked and i'm going to run a clip of this for the
[02:10:10.640 --> 02:10:16.160]   incomparable because i was on we do a game show at the incomparable and it every two weeks and it's a
[02:10:16.160 --> 02:10:20.720]   different thing we we do some classic games and like trivial pursuit things and things like but
[02:10:20.720 --> 02:10:25.680]   not family feud and uh there's a game that lex freedman who now works for amazon by the way in the
[02:10:25.680 --> 02:10:31.120]   podcast division uh he came up with a game called friendly competition and it's uh people he asks
[02:10:31.120 --> 02:10:36.320]   them to do things so we have to do some tasks beforehand and then it's a silly game and we sort of
[02:10:36.320 --> 02:10:41.920]   competing for meeting his inscrutable rules and one of the rounds i'm gonna i'm gonna slip because
[02:10:41.920 --> 02:10:46.720]   the uh episode isn't out yet was called hashtag glenning which is what people call me whenever i
[02:10:46.720 --> 02:10:52.480]   name drop some of the people i know and uh he said one of the questions was uh so the round was
[02:10:52.480 --> 02:10:57.200]   which podcast has glenn been on and there were points off for non-uniqueness and someone put
[02:10:57.200 --> 02:11:03.120]   twit and i said they said have you ever been on this we can take it i'm like oh my gosh i don't know
[02:11:03.120 --> 02:11:08.800]   and they're like you don't you know i think i've been asked this i haven't been well set up for video
[02:11:08.800 --> 02:11:14.160]   before i'll be honest this is the first video podcast event i've been on because i'm finally set
[02:11:14.160 --> 02:11:20.240]   with lighting oh you look at the images if like i said ten out of ten on the room right yeah i'll
[02:11:20.240 --> 02:11:24.320]   get the i'll get the duct tape fixed but anyway so it was literally questioned what you just asked me
[02:11:24.320 --> 02:11:28.480]   was literally questioned and we had a researcher during the show you didn't know and i think what's
[02:11:28.480 --> 02:11:33.040]   happened is i think i've been asked to be on thank you on on multiple occasions over the years and i
[02:11:33.040 --> 02:11:37.840]   think i've been oh i'm not really set up with video yet so i finally am and that's why jeff said hey and
[02:11:37.840 --> 02:11:44.400]   i said i was thrilled because i thought you had something against me so no no i thought you guys
[02:11:44.400 --> 02:11:48.400]   might be like oh he keeps saying no why does he keep saying no he must hate us all right all right
[02:11:48.400 --> 02:11:57.200]   i just don't know i have actually i think you were on when jason snell hosted no i didn't know okay i
[02:11:57.200 --> 02:12:03.360]   think i've been mentioned mentioned but not all transcripts yes your my name is i've been taking
[02:12:03.360 --> 02:12:09.200]   my name has been taken what's the opposite of vane i don't know wait a minute you are in fact in in the
[02:12:09.200 --> 02:12:15.440]   uh in the transcripts here isn't a lens lyshman right at peace on boing boing this week is Jason
[02:12:15.440 --> 02:12:21.280]   that's right yeah wow it's what's confusing and in my mind too i i haven't been on that many
[02:12:21.280 --> 02:12:25.440]   different podcasts i used to be on i used to have a regular gig on local radio station and so forth
[02:12:25.440 --> 02:12:30.160]   and uh i do a lot of incongable stuff and was the host of the mackewool podcast for a few years
[02:12:30.800 --> 02:12:34.560]   uh several years ago and uh anyway it is this funny that i'm like all right now i have officially
[02:12:34.560 --> 02:12:38.640]   i know you two have encountered the same problem i haven't officially done so many things in my life
[02:12:38.640 --> 02:12:42.880]   that are different i can't remember all the things i did or if i did something oh absolutely
[02:12:42.880 --> 02:12:48.240]   obvious question have you been on this week in time well you think i would know so the fact that i
[02:12:48.240 --> 02:12:54.240]   asked you is exactly the same problem none either of us 10 000 shows i'm not sure but you know what
[02:12:54.240 --> 02:13:00.640]   many remembers well glenn i i am deeply sincere you're going to be back and back as often as you
[02:13:00.640 --> 02:13:05.680]   will do it because you're fantastic pleasure let me come back and talk about usb c cables that's
[02:13:05.680 --> 02:13:10.960]   my latest book is about oh my god we were sorting out cables we just spent a half an hour talking
[02:13:10.960 --> 02:13:16.800]   about it on a mac break weekly oh my god because it's a nightmare you know i write the mac 9-1-1
[02:13:16.800 --> 02:13:22.080]   column for mac world and so i get user it's a best thing to write because in this world i can't cure
[02:13:22.080 --> 02:13:28.960]   cancer i'm not a medical researcher i'm not a i can't help people directly with their with their
[02:13:28.960 --> 02:13:35.520]   bodies or disease or maybe fighting war those aren't my my specialties but i can answer questions
[02:13:35.520 --> 02:13:40.560]   about macs and iPhones so i get these emails people i can't do someone i have an ex-boyfriend
[02:13:40.560 --> 02:13:44.400]   who's looking at stuff on my phone and i'll write back i'm like here is an answer and they're like
[02:13:44.400 --> 02:13:49.920]   thank you i'm like oh my god i made somebody's life a tiny bit better but cables people write in more
[02:13:49.920 --> 02:13:55.120]   about oh yeah cables and ports and standards anything else a nightmare the uh the take control book
[02:13:55.120 --> 02:14:00.880]   series a whole book about cables if you can believe that so we uh we were talking about
[02:14:00.880 --> 02:14:06.240]   yesterday it's a nightmare benson leon who is the google engineer who was doing all of the
[02:14:06.240 --> 02:14:12.000]   checks on all of these cables right he's actually on our twitch social mastodon instance and i was i
[02:14:12.000 --> 02:14:18.320]   was a little star struck i said oh benson leon so and more about the standard he knows a lot about
[02:14:18.320 --> 02:14:24.240]   this stuff he this is what is part of his job at google so um and he had the machinery to test these
[02:14:24.240 --> 02:14:28.400]   things yeah that's the hard part yeah that's where people are like i have a cable i don't know what it
[02:14:28.400 --> 02:14:32.400]   does how do i tell how do you know plug it in no you got to plug it in see what doesn't work and
[02:14:32.400 --> 02:14:38.160]   we cannot it doesn't feel modern it came up because we were showing uh the apple has a hundred fifty
[02:14:38.160 --> 02:14:43.520]   nine dollar thunderbolt four cable and we were showing the the tear down of it and it's got a huge
[02:14:43.520 --> 02:14:48.720]   it's got eight chips in it it's huge it's a hugely sophisticated device earning its price
[02:14:48.720 --> 02:14:52.720]   and so we were started talking about well what do you get for a twenty dollar thunderbolt
[02:14:52.720 --> 02:14:56.640]   four cable compared to that oh yeah and then we can get a good one now it's uh if can i
[02:14:56.640 --> 02:15:01.120]   mention a brand name yeah i'm not sponsored by them it's uh other world computing makes now
[02:15:01.120 --> 02:15:05.200]   yeah i see i see i can see i mentioned that one it's like 40 bucks yeah it's uh yeah they have like
[02:15:05.200 --> 02:15:11.040]   it's 27 for a really short one up to 59 i want to see i trust owc so yeah i bought a lot of stuff
[02:15:11.040 --> 02:15:15.440]   from them i have a pile of them because i was trying to sort that out but yeah it's it's uh
[02:15:15.440 --> 02:15:19.840]   if you get a thunderbolt four usb four cable you can be in good shape but it's funny because
[02:15:19.840 --> 02:15:23.680]   that's what we concluded is that from now on just buy thunderbolt four cables because they're
[02:15:23.680 --> 02:15:27.840]   gonna do another affordable yeah they're affordable and why not yeah all right let's take a little
[02:15:27.840 --> 02:15:32.000]   break and glenn we have a tradition at the end of the show pick of the week just something anything
[02:15:32.000 --> 02:15:35.360]   could be a typeface it could be a story or it could be it could be something in your in your
[02:15:35.360 --> 02:15:39.520]   collection there too yeah something if you click anything you want a book whatever you want a tv
[02:15:39.520 --> 02:15:44.880]   show you like uh podcasts you'd like to be on whatever whatever you want a ranch before we do
[02:15:44.880 --> 02:15:52.080]   that though i do want to talk about the biggest change in sleep technology i have ever experienced
[02:15:52.080 --> 02:15:57.200]   we talk a lot about sleep you know mica sergeant did a podcast about sleep for a long time he
[02:15:57.200 --> 02:16:03.840]   subscribes to the journal of sleep pathology or whatever uh and is very interested in sleep and
[02:16:03.840 --> 02:16:08.560]   i've been talking to him about this kevin rose was the guy who turned me on to it it's called eight sleep
[02:16:09.120 --> 02:16:15.520]   uh amy web got it when she was one with kevin rose she said leo you have to get this you can get it as
[02:16:15.520 --> 02:16:20.560]   a mattress or what we did at home we got the pod pro cover we got about six months ago in fact
[02:16:20.560 --> 02:16:25.680]   jeff remembers the story of me putting it on wrong there is a very good video i hastened
[02:16:25.680 --> 02:16:30.880]   ahead on the eight sleep site if i had watched it i would have been able to put it on right now
[02:16:30.880 --> 02:16:36.800]   what does this do it is not a heating pad it is a heating and cooling
[02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:44.320]   it's not even a pad a heating and cooling cover that can go as low as 55 degrees which is pretty
[02:16:44.320 --> 02:16:50.000]   chilly on a hot night i can't wait to a hot summer night and try that to 110 degrees which is
[02:16:50.000 --> 02:16:57.840]   definitely hot a heating pad hot and anywhere in between here's the thing it's connected to sensors
[02:16:57.840 --> 02:17:04.240]   it does biometric tracking it knows the temperature of the room and it will adjust the temperature of
[02:17:04.240 --> 02:17:10.240]   your bed as you sleep and it will continue to adjust it to give you the best night sleep you
[02:17:10.240 --> 02:17:16.560]   ever had i could promise it really works i have never slept better than the with the eight sleep
[02:17:16.560 --> 02:17:23.280]   it's i need not say i think sleep is the holy grail for all of us it is nature's gentle nurse it is
[02:17:23.280 --> 02:17:28.320]   it is it is the ultimate gain temperature and in your life yet 30 percent of americans
[02:17:28.320 --> 02:17:33.040]   struggle with sleep and temperature is one of the main reasons why ever wake up sweaty at night
[02:17:33.040 --> 02:17:41.200]   that's the worst or freezing cold our bodies are designed biologically to go to bed when it's warm
[02:17:41.200 --> 02:17:48.480]   you know you put the fire out get in bed it slowly cools off during the night until the morning and
[02:17:48.480 --> 02:17:53.680]   that is what we expect and yet we live in such climate control circumstances we don't actually
[02:17:53.680 --> 02:17:58.480]   experience that so the eight sleep does that and you can set it Lisa sets it a little higher than i do
[02:17:58.480 --> 02:18:03.840]   by the way if you get you know one for double bed or we have a king there are two sides so Lisa
[02:18:03.840 --> 02:18:10.240]   gets her settings completely independent of my settings dynamic cooling and heating with biometric
[02:18:10.240 --> 02:18:16.400]   tracking can go on any mattress it watches your sleep and it gets you into a deep sleep and then
[02:18:16.400 --> 02:18:20.480]   gets you out of it in fact i have it set to warm up when i have to wake up in the morning it's the
[02:18:20.480 --> 02:18:27.120]   best alarm i've ever had no sound nothing it's very quiet i just i feel warm and i go i'm ready
[02:18:28.160 --> 02:18:33.920]   eight sleep users fall asleep 32 percent faster reduce sleep interruptions by 40 percent and get
[02:18:33.920 --> 02:18:40.960]   overall more restful sleep imagine 30 percent more deep sleep what could you do with that you just
[02:18:40.960 --> 02:18:45.680]   would feel a lot better throughout the day i will vouch for this because we've been using it for
[02:18:45.680 --> 02:18:51.840]   six months and i'll tell you what i'm never stopping i'm never not going to use this go to eight sleep

[02:19:26.400 --> 02:19:33.120]   70 percent that is awfully good you can see the temperatures it has a lot of information in here

[02:20:21.040 --> 02:20:26.240]   web we wanted to have her on the show because we knew aunt wouldn't be here this week uh she said
[02:20:26.240 --> 02:20:31.600]   unfortunately she was doing a stern school uh alumni event tonight couldn't be here she will be
[02:20:31.600 --> 02:20:36.960]   here soon because i have got to hear what she thinks about all of this i think increasingly
[02:20:38.080 --> 02:20:44.160]   the sense i get is the billionaires are out of control and it's time really as a country to think
[02:20:44.160 --> 02:20:50.080]   about and maybe it has a world to think about do we need these oligarchs i still like blends finland
[02:20:50.080 --> 02:20:56.640]   the finland and fleshman and fleshman finland trip what's that i mean you need to put oh you get
[02:20:56.640 --> 02:21:01.040]   you get uh you're driving uh if you have a driving infraction for action oh that one yeah yeah
[02:21:01.040 --> 02:21:05.920]   percentage of your uh yeah yeah yeah yeah so if jeff pesos jwachs in seattle you'd have to pay a
[02:21:05.920 --> 02:21:12.240]   billion dollar yes now jay walking we have to understand was invented by the car industry
[02:21:12.240 --> 02:21:17.280]   to penalize pedestrians i'm sorry i'm sorry so we will not give him a fine for jay walking that's
[02:21:17.280 --> 02:21:22.720]   not that is some good history i think that's great that's great just watch uh who frame roger rabbit
[02:21:22.720 --> 02:21:29.040]   for more information about the uh demise of cars i get all my history from roger rabbit yeah uh no
[02:21:29.040 --> 02:21:36.240]   actually i have been following um a uh subreddit i i am propagandized by reddit but i think in a
[02:21:36.240 --> 02:21:41.680]   beneficial way anti-work has taught me how many awful bosses there are in the world there's a
[02:21:41.680 --> 02:21:49.840]   slash r slash uh i can't say it on a imply company f cars that really it makes a strong case for
[02:21:49.840 --> 02:21:54.880]   getting rid of private car ownership we need obviously trucks we need uh you know conveyances
[02:21:54.880 --> 02:22:01.680]   but uh but private car ownership is not it's not good for this world nor are oligarchs uh glenn do you
[02:22:01.680 --> 02:22:09.280]   have a pick for us yeah this is uh this is a site i read every day that's called web three is going
[02:22:09.280 --> 02:22:15.280]   just great i love this site i figured you would know this and it i don't know why like okay so
[02:22:15.280 --> 02:22:19.280]   there are positive joys in this world there's things that we celebrate because they we love them
[02:22:19.280 --> 02:22:25.840]   we see a picture of a puppy we see uh Ukrainian people rebuilding their cities already after the
[02:22:25.840 --> 02:22:30.400]   Russian forces have moved on incredible things that bring us joy in different ways then there's
[02:22:30.400 --> 02:22:34.480]   shadenfreude and we've been talking about a germ in this episode the shadenfreude is that guilty
[02:22:34.480 --> 02:22:39.600]   joy you have a joy in misfortune by a German teacher in college said shadenfreude is when you see
[02:22:39.600 --> 02:22:44.320]   someone your enemy wearing a bowler hat the enemy wearing the bowler hat is the best part crossing
[02:22:44.320 --> 02:22:49.920]   the street their bowler hat flies off and is crushed by a passing car shot even you feel that is
[02:22:49.920 --> 02:22:56.960]   shadenfreude right so so for my so for my ronick bowler hat is the best part of them yes that's
[02:22:56.960 --> 02:23:03.920]   right so if i want to go like a layback and just you know relax in a pool of shadenfreude i go to
[02:23:03.920 --> 02:23:11.360]   web three is going just because every day i now i want to distinguish i feel bad for the people
[02:23:11.360 --> 02:23:17.440]   who are being built by cryptocurrency scammers and nft scammers because the most of the coverage is
[02:23:17.440 --> 02:23:26.240]   how uh this or that coin drop or nft or new cryptocurrency or whatever how it's gone belly up
[02:23:26.240 --> 02:23:31.040]   and uh how all the money is gone all the crypto is drained out or there was a bug and everyone's
[02:23:31.040 --> 02:23:36.000]   money was stolen and i feel terrible for the people who got scammed into this yes some of them are
[02:23:36.000 --> 02:23:40.560]   wealthy a lot of people i don't mind if bitcoin bros get scammed in fact yeah a little sun
[02:23:40.560 --> 02:23:44.160]   froder there but they're a lot but the only but the whole purpose of their
[02:23:44.160 --> 02:23:49.360]   promotion is to get normal people to sink money into it so they can get out
[02:23:49.360 --> 02:23:54.800]   yeah so i think this this cadence of a blowing kazoo that molly does where it's just like
[02:23:54.800 --> 02:24:01.280]   at the funeral you know it's like it's the it's the performance that tells you you can't believe in
[02:24:01.280 --> 02:24:06.240]   this stuff because here is a drum beat of everything the billions of dollars that are being stolen
[02:24:07.280 --> 02:24:14.080]   all the time so i i love this site in a perverse way and molly is also great on uh on twitter i think
[02:24:14.080 --> 02:24:20.800]   she's she's she's molly zero x fff which is a great hexadecimal programming joke on twitter and she's
[02:24:20.800 --> 02:24:28.000]   just a terrific person there's nothing like or what it is white molly white and she had
[02:24:28.000 --> 02:24:35.120]   show oh that's a clever oh that's i didn't catch that oh you didn't know what xfmm
[02:24:35.120 --> 02:24:41.840]   no i wasn't thinking about this oh i just agree that's the hexaver last name oh my gosh that's
[02:24:41.840 --> 02:24:48.320]   perfect but she like david jorar is another person who who is extremely expert in the topic they would
[02:24:48.320 --> 02:24:56.240]   like crypto currency or cryptography based financial stuff to become a reality in some fashion they're
[02:24:56.240 --> 02:25:00.480]   not opposed to it they're they're painted often by people or hypesters that they hate this stuff
[02:25:00.480 --> 02:25:04.400]   they don't they actually love it they understand it incredibly well they just hate what's happening
[02:25:04.400 --> 02:25:09.280]   right now and they're willing to poke holes in it instead of promoting it and uh anyway so uh
[02:25:09.280 --> 02:25:16.160]   my new i knew i knew that trouble was afoot when my daughter asked how she could invest in dogecoin
[02:25:16.160 --> 02:25:20.720]   that's when i knew there was a problem by the way molly brilliant she has a thing that i think should
[02:25:20.720 --> 02:25:26.720]   be on many websites it's the grift meter in the lower right hand corner you can it starts as
[02:25:26.720 --> 02:25:34.320]   hero and as you scroll through the losses rolled up by bitcoin people the meter goes up
[02:25:34.320 --> 02:25:43.280]   as the money goes out this ladies jumbo this is the f company dot com i agree
[02:25:43.280 --> 02:25:50.240]   it's f company three dot oh yeah oh my gosh no it totally i love the eight bit grift meter in the
[02:25:50.240 --> 02:25:54.880]   lower right hand corner for that reason alone web three is great that's a very very good pick
[02:25:54.880 --> 02:26:01.840]   i love i like it jeff thank you gleng jeff always gives us a number of the week your number this
[02:26:01.840 --> 02:26:06.960]   week mr um so i i was i liked the fact that reddit i mean you know youtube gives away money to people
[02:26:06.960 --> 02:26:10.800]   to make stuff and then we know that we know how that works but reddit has just created a one million
[02:26:10.800 --> 02:26:18.320]   dollar fund to just fund users best ideas in that reddity way which is what we need to do we need
[02:26:18.320 --> 02:26:23.840]   to be encouraging and supporting the good stuff and and good voice and good creativity and so i
[02:26:23.840 --> 02:26:29.600]   just want to give them a shout out for that yeah you know increasingly reddit has become my social
[02:26:29.600 --> 02:26:36.160]   network that and discord which i'm in love with our club twit discord is a great place to hang
[02:26:36.160 --> 02:26:42.800]   uh i like our forums we use discourse for our forms that's the twit dot community forums
[02:26:42.800 --> 02:26:46.800]   and i have to say i am now going to really spend a lot more time on mastodon because
[02:26:47.680 --> 02:26:52.560]   one of the where where do you i what which one i have ours we have one three people there have one
[02:26:52.560 --> 02:27:00.400]   jeff yours twit dot social the reason the the one of one of many reasons that mastodon is great is
[02:27:00.400 --> 02:27:07.920]   elon must could never buy it yes there's thousands of independent servers which are all federated
[02:27:07.920 --> 02:27:12.960]   together jeff when you when you join twit dot social i guess this is becoming my pick when you
[02:27:12.960 --> 02:27:17.680]   join when you join when you yeah well i'll show you a couple of things about mastodon first of all
[02:27:17.680 --> 02:27:23.040]   we don't call them tweets we call them toots so that's very important okay you're you're tooting
[02:27:23.040 --> 02:27:28.080]   and instead of 280 characters you actually have 500 characters there are some really nice standards
[02:27:28.080 --> 02:27:34.400]   for instance you see this toot has a sensitive comment a content banner on it it is anytime you
[02:27:34.400 --> 02:27:40.320]   think an image might offend you but you just press that sensitive content but on baking what could
[02:27:40.320 --> 02:27:47.040]   it be well you write you some people don't want to see pictures of bread oh that's obscene oh
[02:27:47.040 --> 02:27:53.520]   makes me hungry makes me hungry so you can write your yeah you can write your content warning here
[02:27:53.520 --> 02:28:01.120]   watch out gluttons you know or whatever it is on your picture of bread i like that feature
[02:28:01.120 --> 02:28:08.800]   when you're when you're tooting you're you're tooting to the local mastodon instance but you're also
[02:28:08.800 --> 02:28:16.480]   tooting to anybody who is federated and wants to follow you so your name is qualified so my name
[02:28:16.480 --> 02:28:24.080]   on twit social is at leo my global name though is at leo at you could show this at leo at twit
[02:28:24.080 --> 02:28:29.840]   at twit social over here and so you can follow anybody if you know what instance they're on there
[02:28:29.840 --> 02:28:36.640]   also is a search function so you can quickly find what instance they're on so we can as find out who
[02:28:36.640 --> 02:28:40.720]   from twitter all by twitter friends on here well more and more people are going in there
[02:28:40.720 --> 02:28:46.800]   which i think is i think maybe is a good sign it has all the benefits of twitter except it's
[02:28:46.800 --> 02:28:51.360]   just not as many people and there it has to be somewhat geeky you should look though and there
[02:28:51.360 --> 02:28:57.920]   is a long list of mastodon servers you may not want to join ours you may say well i want to hang
[02:28:57.920 --> 02:29:04.720]   out with a bunch of type nerds and there may well be a type nerd mastodon server because of us yeah
[02:29:05.280 --> 02:29:11.600]   well because it's um federated it's easy to start a server oh my server only has maybe a few hundred
[02:29:11.600 --> 02:29:17.040]   maybe i think it's actually a thousand people on it now um i don't you can also as a server not
[02:29:17.040 --> 02:29:22.080]   federate with servers you don't like so gab is on mastodon as well but i don't federate with them
[02:29:22.080 --> 02:29:28.560]   so i don't see anything from gab and they don't see anything from uh twit social there are a number
[02:29:28.560 --> 02:29:35.040]   of directories of mastodon servers but if you don't have a particular preference um then i would suggest
[02:29:35.040 --> 02:29:40.240]   you join twit.social but the point is you can do that anywhere you know you can follow anybody
[02:29:40.240 --> 02:29:47.920]   anywhere from any server so you're never really uh limited uh i think it has everything that good
[02:29:47.920 --> 02:29:53.360]   about twitter except for the community unfortunately uh yeah i think we're gonna see a lot of retreating
[02:29:53.360 --> 02:30:00.560]   into uh discord and slacks and discourses and mastodon instances uh it'll buy but you know actually
[02:30:00.560 --> 02:30:05.840]   that it's almost like we're retreating into caves waiting for the flood to be over or something like
[02:30:05.840 --> 02:30:11.600]   the weather to change oh there's a dove on the horizon no one must be nearby that's right where's
[02:30:11.600 --> 02:30:16.880]   the bug is get out of the arc if we get uh and then someone could build something or request
[02:30:16.880 --> 02:30:23.040]   pardon me we'll see if oh yeah so i approve them that's the other thing oh good uh as a moderator
[02:30:23.040 --> 02:30:27.920]   uh one of the things i do is i uh i approve them and it's not so much because i want to keep
[02:30:28.640 --> 02:30:35.760]   uh donald trump off my mastodon uh but because um there are a lot there's spammers all right so
[02:30:35.760 --> 02:30:40.240]   and i can always tell because when you join i ask you to say something
[02:30:40.240 --> 02:30:49.120]   about why you want to join and when people say i wish to share news about my fine company uh i do
[02:30:49.120 --> 02:30:55.120]   not in fact let you i said leo told me to yes i see that so you know one of the things uh the
[02:30:55.120 --> 02:31:00.880]   xoxo conference that uh is i think on a hatist right now because of the uh you know the pandemic uh
[02:31:00.880 --> 02:31:04.560]   they think in the first year they sold tickets to general public and they they neither gonna be
[02:31:04.560 --> 02:31:08.800]   oversubscribed they asked everyone who wanted to buy a ticket there was like a question which was
[02:31:08.800 --> 02:31:12.480]   tell us something you made recently and they said later this basically filtered out all the
[02:31:12.480 --> 02:31:17.040]   marketing people oh it's brilliant because the market wasn't that they're not creatives but they
[02:31:17.040 --> 02:31:22.000]   what their orientation wasn't such they could fill that question route in a way that or or at all
[02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:27.280]   and so it turned it also when you call it event hugs and kisses xoxo it tends to turn people off
[02:31:27.280 --> 02:31:31.280]   i want to come and talk it's a wonderful event and i think that's probably one of the reasons right
[02:31:31.280 --> 02:31:37.040]   when on the as you notice it looks a lot like tweet deck jeff uh on the right you can follow the
[02:31:37.040 --> 02:31:42.320]   local timeline which is just twit dot social or you can follow the federated timeline which is a
[02:31:42.320 --> 02:31:48.000]   timeline of all the people on all the you as the boss choose what to federate with the default
[02:31:48.000 --> 02:31:52.160]   is federated with everybody and then there are few there's really only two you eliminate some
[02:31:52.160 --> 02:31:57.040]   you know i've eliminated now i get it now i understand in fact here's something in german so
[02:31:57.040 --> 02:32:03.520]   i was saying you know i must affect has secured digital courage that oh i see it's a site called
[02:32:03.520 --> 02:32:09.360]   the must effect is a secured digital courage dot social uh weather uh if you have a profile
[02:32:09.360 --> 02:32:13.440]   in cost implied it's gonna if you want to profile you're gonna have to pay one euro a month i think
[02:32:13.440 --> 02:32:18.880]   it's next is maul biaven de gans de stun de alve doych spreken yeah that's right it will be terrible
[02:32:18.880 --> 02:32:22.080]   be uh uh uh
[02:32:22.080 --> 02:32:27.440]   it's like like pretty not uh do uh i seem to have lost control of the language of this show which
[02:32:27.440 --> 02:32:32.560]   is the first this is actually a first uh for my your current grotesque uber grotesque spreken
[02:32:32.560 --> 02:32:39.600]   yeah yeah uh uh uh legislative s echeline we'd love to have you twit dot social it is you know if
[02:32:39.600 --> 02:32:43.920]   you're looking for twitter it's not twitter but honestly there's nothing to keep it from being
[02:32:43.920 --> 02:32:49.120]   twitter exactly that's the first instance what got me if all the people who say we want a community
[02:32:49.120 --> 02:32:56.400]   on black twitter created a mastodon instance that could be it um where people aren't happy with it
[02:32:56.400 --> 02:33:01.440]   is you're not broadcasting to this vast audience which is frankly with the benefit of this from
[02:33:01.440 --> 02:33:06.720]   from my point it's what it's why i like instagram let me instagram and mastodon actually have things
[02:33:06.720 --> 02:33:11.600]   in common in a weird way which is that instagram it's not a it's not a walled garden or a closed
[02:33:11.600 --> 02:33:17.280]   garden but i don't have to see much on instagram beyond my what do you call it my chart and it's
[02:33:17.280 --> 02:33:23.200]   great i see babies and dogs and art and people our wife loves instagram i can't do it because
[02:33:23.200 --> 02:33:29.680]   every now it used to be every tenth post now it's much more seems much more frequent there's an ad
