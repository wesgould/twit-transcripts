[00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.720]   recorded July 14, 2010.
[00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.040]   Open Source loves you.
[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.400]   [MUSIC PLAYING]

[00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:52.920]   It's time for Twig this week in Google
[00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.120]   to show the covers of the Googleverse and the cloud.
[00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.560]   Cloud computing in general as well with us right now,
[00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.600]   of course.
[00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.520]   Great Gina Trapani, founder of Life Hacker and Blogger
[00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.360]   at smarterware.org, the author of the software formerly
[00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.440]   known as Think Tank.
[00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.120]   We'll talk about that.
[00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.440]   Yeah, we can talk about that.
[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.880]   Hi, Gina.
[00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:13.680]   Welcome.
[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:14.180]   Hello.
[00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:14.680]   Thank you.
[00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.440]   This is you with your Madonna mic.
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.120]   My Madonna.
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.600]   Also here, Jeff Jarvis with--
[00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.880]   Steve Farle, Les Fach, Mulchiki, Norki, Mike.
[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.480]   This is the Claftvark, Mike On.
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.760]   And Jeff is, of course, a professor of journalism
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:28.920]   at the City University of New York,
[00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.600]   very well known in journalistic circles for years,
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.920]   the author of What Would Google Do and Blogger@buzzmachine.com.
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.520]   Great to have you both.
[00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.440]   No Googlers with us, although we got a thumbs up
[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.440]   from the Google that we could perhaps do a feature which
[00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.160]   I'd like to do starting soon with a featured Google product
[00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.360]   and an engineer every week, just for 10 minutes.
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.680]   So I think that's a chance for us
[00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.160]   to talk about something Google's doing with somebody
[00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.120]   who's writing the software and get kind of an inside story
[00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.880]   on that, which I think will be fun.
[00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.480]   So I believe that's in process.
[00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:03.840]   We'll get that started pretty soon.
[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.160]   Meanwhile, I guess we're going to talk about cell phones again.
[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.520]   Somebody said that Google was on track--
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.320]   I haven't looked at the graph, but that Google's on track
[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.560]   to have 100,000 apps on Android by the end of the summer.
[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.680]   Does that sound right, Jeff?
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:21.920]   That's not your number, I hope.
[00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.600]   Oh, it's not.
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.520]   I got five numbers in case you're stealing it.
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.200]   Smart Man is number rich today.
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.920]   That's a lot.
[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.920]   I mean, really, how many applications do you need?
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.400]   If it's got the applications that-- the key ones you want,
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.240]   20, 30 is fine, but 100,000 means you have a good shot.
[00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:41.880]   Yes, it's not 250,000 as the iPhone has,
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.480]   but it's pretty solid.
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.120]   And I think what you're seeing is if you compare iPhone growth,
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.400]   app growth to Android growth, Android is really fast.
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.800]   It's growing fast.
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.360]   But it only amplifies the problem we talked about last week,
[00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.800]   which is the crap problem.
[00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.320]   And how do good-- well, two problems for the first and foremost,
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.480]   how do you discover good apps?
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.560]   How do good apps move up?
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.800]   There's not a good way to do that in either marketplace,
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:07.400]   I think.
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.720]   And then the second problem is how do you get good apps made
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.200]   and really excel there.
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.080]   And that's where I think we talked about last week.
[00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.360]   I don't know if this was newer news.
[00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.880]   The $5 million that Google's going to invest in YouTube.
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.440]   We missed that last week.
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.400]   And I think that that's a really good story.
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:24.880]   Yeah.
[00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:25.400]   It is.
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.320]   And I think that they should do the exact same thing
[00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:28.440]   with the app marketplace.
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:29.960]   And in--
[00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.240]   See it.
[00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:36.560]   Kleiner Perkins has two large funds now for iPhone apps.
[00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.120]   And I presume it's iPad apps.
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:40.600]   Well, I think Google should be investing in the creation
[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.080]   of killer apps.
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.200]   Android Lib, I'm being told by the chat room,
[00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.800]   Pat says, "Andrew Lib," which is an independent Android app
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.840]   website has 95,000 apps.
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.840]   So we're very close.
[00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:53.280]   Wait a minute.
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.600]   And then an estimated number of apps
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.000]   downloaded according to them is 1 billion.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.080]   So look at the graph.
[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.080]   I mean, phenomenal growth.
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.120]   It's not a hockey stick.
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.520]   But it is not linear either.
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.640]   I mean, phenomenal growth over the last three months.
[00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.960]   This is the year begins kind of in the middle of the graph
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.200]   through July.
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.520]   And you're really seeing an uptick.
[00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:21.320]   Now, Google's added this new thing, which we can only trust
[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.280]   others to tell us about because I haven't gotten my
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:23.800]   invitation.
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.640]   I guess you haven't either, Gina.
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:26.400]   I haven't.
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.280]   Soundface.
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.920]   Soundface to the-- what is it?
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:29.880]   App innovator?
[00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.400]   What is it?
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:32.480]   It's the--
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:33.400]   App inventor.
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.720]   App inventor, yes.
[00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:35.920]   What is it?
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:42.440]   It's a web-based visual Android application creation tool.
[00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.080]   So you go to this web page once you get an invite.
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.400]   You can go request an invite if you just Google App inventor.
[00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.840]   You can request an invite, which I did.
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.120]   But there's a YouTube video that kind of shows what it is.
[00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.680]   And it's actually a really cute, cute video.
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:57.280]   But the idea is that it's--
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.040]   what you see is what you get app development for Android.
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.000]   It's just like a wizzy wig editor, basically.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.040]   You create a canvas.
[00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:05.440]   You can drop buttons onto it.
[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.680]   You can assign actions to those buttons.
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.560]   So in the example, the user drops a photo of her cat
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.960]   onto the canvas and then a button that says per.
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.520]   And when you press that button, you can say, play the per sound
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.400]   or make the cat meow when you swipe across the image.
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:21.400]   Cute, cute, cute little app.
[00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:22.440]   That sounds great.
[00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:22.640]   Yeah.
[00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:24.840]   And it seems to be targeted towards educators.
[00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.280]   So they want to get young school kids building apps.
[00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:31.720]   And I think they said they had students as young as sixth grade
[00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:36.120]   making quizzes and question and answer type apps.
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.040]   And I think this is a great thing, right?
[00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:39.960]   I mean, some developers are complaining.
[00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.080]   Or some people were saying, this is just going to flood
[00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.480]   the Android market with crap apps.
[00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:46.600]   Anybody could just slap together.
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.680]   But I have to tell you, as someone who's knee deep and building
[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.000]   an Android app, not the App Inventor way, doing it the old--
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.760]   It's hard doing it the old way.
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:55.800]   It's hard.
[00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.560]   It's much harder than it needs to be.
[00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:01.080]   And in fact, I think that Google could do a lot of work just
[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.520]   in that.
[00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:03.480]   Here's download Eclipse.
[00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:04.240]   Here's the SDK.
[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.120]   Build your app.
[00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:07.400]   So I really liked the idea of making it easy, even just
[00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.240]   to do layout of buttons and boxes and tabs.
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.600]   Could you use App Inventor as a starting point
[00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:15.960]   and then get back into the code or is it kind of opaque
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:16.920]   at that point?
[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:17.880]   This is the problem.
[00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:20.520]   App Inventor does not generate source code
[00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.200]   that you can modify.
[00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:23.480]   So this is my problem with it.
[00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:24.320]   I think it's awesome.
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:25.320]   It's more like blinds.
[00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:25.920]   Yeah.
[00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:26.480]   Yeah.
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:27.000]   It's like that.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.440]   It's like that.
[00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.520]   Yeah, so I wish that it generated the Java
[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:32.240]   so that you could download them the code
[00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:36.600]   and then progress from there and work with the app.
[00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.800]   Because everyone knows what happens when you get a WYSI
[00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:39.480]   wig out at our right.
[00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:41.240]   Everyone started using Dreamweaver or whatever,
[00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:42.800]   starting creating web pages.
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:44.640]   And it would generate crappy code.
[00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:46.760]   Who knows what kind of code this is creating.
[00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:48.440]   But I think this is only a good thing.
[00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:50.480]   You want to create interest.
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:53.440]   And right now, building a Hello World Android app,
[00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:55.360]   the old school way--
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:56.360]   Homeboy.
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:57.880]   --is just too hard.
[00:06:57.880 --> 00:06:59.520]   It's too hard.
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.640]   And so I'd like to see them improve in that area.
[00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:04.040]   Gina buzzed it when she got the Hello World app running.
[00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.760]   She buzzed a screenshot.
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:06.760]   It was like a big accomplishment.
[00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:08.480]   It's like a big deal.
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:08.960]   Yeah.
[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:09.680]   And I've done it too.
[00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:11.760]   And really, the accomplishment is getting all the tools installed
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:14.160]   and working properly in your environment.
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.440]   But once you do that, I have to say
[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:19.120]   that from a professional programmer looking
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:22.640]   at what Google's doing, many of them already use Eclipse.
[00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:24.800]   They certainly know Java.
[00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:27.400]   And I think it's a very nice application framework.
[00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:28.520]   I mean, I haven't looked under the hood
[00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:31.960]   to see how nicely put together it is.
[00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:34.920]   But it's a fairly complete framework, right?
[00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:35.280]   I mean--
[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:35.600]   It is.
[00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:36.480]   The framework is great.
[00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:38.200]   And I love Eclipse and have experience with Eclipse
[00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:39.320]   having been a Java developer.
[00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:41.760]   But I'm a new mobile app developer.
[00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:44.720]   And even with Java experience and knowing Eclipse,
[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:47.280]   I still installing SDK and going through all the steps.
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:49.600]   And it's a long ramp to the Hello World.
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:50.100]   Wow.
[00:07:50.100 --> 00:07:51.880]   You want to shorten that ramp as much as possible
[00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:52.680]   to get people.
[00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:54.960]   Because you get so excited when you see that Hello World work.
[00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:55.480]   Yeah.
[00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:56.920]   And then when you change it to Hello Gina,
[00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:57.840]   you're like, yes.
[00:07:57.840 --> 00:07:59.280]   Do what I want to do.
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:01.680]   You want to make that path as short as possible to the developer.
[00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:02.560]   That's not so bad.
[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:03.600]   It's the stuff that--
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:04.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:05.120]   --that the ramp gets old.
[00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:05.800]   I remember that.
[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:06.320]   Thanks, really.
[00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:07.400]   This is the name for that.
[00:08:07.400 --> 00:08:11.160]   I think, Gina, I too heard kind of the priesthood of programmers,
[00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:12.520]   some of them objecting.
[00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:13.920]   Well, I heard two different things.
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:15.680]   One is, yes, the pro is not liking it.
[00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:20.280]   The other one is Amateurs saying it's still too hard.
[00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:22.040]   Well, yeah, you're going to be in that bind,
[00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:23.320]   but it's a step in the right direction.
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:25.200]   But to me, the use is your right educational number one.
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:27.400]   But number two, I think what's brilliant about this
[00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:29.640]   is that I can imagine a business using this
[00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:33.160]   to create their own app just for their sales force.
[00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:34.160]   Yes.
[00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:35.080]   That's interesting.
[00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:38.320]   I'm using this for salesforce.com.
[00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:40.640]   And so what it does is it drives people
[00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:42.800]   to have to then be on Android.
[00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:47.680]   And I can't imagine Steve Jobs ever doing this.
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:48.200]   Because--
[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:50.480]   No, in fact, you know who did do this?
[00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:52.640]   Microsoft, in some ways.
[00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:56.440]   Microsoft Visual Basic really propelled business
[00:08:56.440 --> 00:09:00.960]   apps for Windows because it was so easy to code business apps
[00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:01.560]   for Windows.
[00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:04.880]   And I think that that has a lot to do with maybe
[00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:07.960]   the adoption of Windows in business.
[00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:10.000]   You can create custom codes.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.640]   There was a lot of reference to HyperCard.
[00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:15.560]   And so it disappeared.
[00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:16.760]   It was nothing.
[00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:19.960]   But then Kevin Marks came in Twitter and said, well,
[00:09:19.960 --> 00:09:22.120]   Tim Berners-Lee used it as inspiration in his way
[00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:24.160]   for the web.
[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:27.800]   The founder of Wikis has also inspired him.
[00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:31.240]   And I think that the more Gina's right--
[00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:34.520]   and Gina is always a generous Democrat here--
[00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:37.040]   a lower case D in terms of inviting more people in.
[00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:39.240]   And the more people who use the stuff,
[00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:40.400]   the better it is for all of us.
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:41.320]   No question about it.
[00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:43.640]   So you don't dismiss the notion that you're
[00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:45.360]   going to get a bunch of crappy more.
[00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:46.000]   Of course you will.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:46.840]   I get tons of crap.
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:49.440]   But that again amplifies the problem for Google
[00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:52.560]   is that you've got to curate the best of the stuff
[00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:54.480]   and find good stuff and create it.
[00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:55.640]   But this is not for that.
[00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:59.800]   There's not going to be a million download app coming out
[00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:01.600]   of App and Better.
[00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:03.920]   Someone said, when I applied for an invite,
[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:06.600]   I applied as an educator because I am on the board of trustees
[00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:08.560]   of my kids high school.
[00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:10.600]   They are adding Java.
[00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:13.840]   And I've been advising the instructor on Java curriculum.
[00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:16.920]   And I do very much think that the kids should, at least
[00:10:16.920 --> 00:10:18.360]   after they've studied Java a little bit,
[00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:20.720]   get a taste of mobile development.
[00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:24.880]   Because isn't that the future of programming?
[00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:26.880]   And mobile development presents these challenges
[00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:28.560]   that you don't have to think about on the desktop.
[00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:31.800]   You're dealing with very little bandwidth, very little memory.
[00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:34.400]   You're dealing with someone with a very short attention span.
[00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:38.320]   I mean, if your app doesn't respond to a tap,
[00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:41.840]   within one or two seconds, it feels broken.
[00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:44.920]   So you go back to this minimalist sense of--
[00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:47.680]   with web apps, we're injecting jQuery.
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:49.400]   We've got all this really heavy stuff going on
[00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:50.520]   because you've got these rich clients
[00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:52.560]   and these thick broadband connections.
[00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:54.800]   With mobile development, it's a whole different playing
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:55.320]   field.
[00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:56.680]   It's really interesting.
[00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:58.320]   You're presented with all these interesting limitations.
[00:10:58.320 --> 00:10:59.880]   You have to reduce the number of taps in order
[00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:01.080]   to get things done.
[00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:03.000]   It's really-- it's a fantastic--
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:03.880]   it got me really excited.
[00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:05.520]   I was like, oh, this is a new programming challenge.
[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:07.120]   Something that I haven't had before.
[00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:09.400]   As a journalism teacher, one of the fights
[00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:10.520]   that we have with our students here--
[00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:11.680]   I probably shouldn't say it that way--
[00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:14.880]   but some students say you should make me into a Flash programmer.
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:17.160]   And I keep on saying, no, not only a Flash.
[00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:18.120]   No.
[00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:22.160]   But because I said you should be the boss of the Flash programmer.
[00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:24.720]   As a journalist, we're not going to be able to turn you
[00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:26.440]   into a great programmer here.
[00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:28.600]   And what you need to be able to do is know how to spec.
[00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:29.600]   You need to know what it can do.
[00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:30.600]   You need to spec it.
[00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:32.360]   And you need to be a project manager.
[00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:33.440]   What it strikes me about--
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:34.600]   I got to play with App & Vendor.
[00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:37.600]   But it strikes me that it might be that step in the right direction
[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:39.480]   to say, OK, you want to make something?
[00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:42.200]   Make a mobile app.
[00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:43.440]   I can't wait to play with this.
[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:45.000]   I'm very curious to--
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.880]   I mean, the trivial example that we just
[00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:49.560]   showed in the video that's on the page
[00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:53.840]   doesn't really inspire one to write an app.
[00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:55.120]   No, not too much.
[00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:59.400]   But if you look at the App & Vendor page, the Tutorials page,
[00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:01.960]   they have some example apps.
[00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:04.160]   And so the Hello Per, which is the Pet the Kitten,
[00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:06.200]   and it Per's app is at the top.
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:08.400]   But then there's some Advanced App, which is a Quizme--
[00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:10.000]   Yeah, we have a little bit of a go there.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:10.520]   OK.
[00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:13.440]   Yeah, trivia game about baseball.
[00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:15.200]   Where's the Bus Schedule game?
[00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:17.640]   Bus Schedule program.
[00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:19.600]   Can I-- is there any way I can try this?
[00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:21.840]   Or I guess you have to download it and try it.
[00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:25.040]   It looks like--
[00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:26.920]   Yeah, it looks like you can download and try it.
[00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:28.600]   But yeah, this is OK.
[00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:30.400]   You know, I mean, if it's a quiz,
[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:34.480]   and I could see huge benefits to a teacher
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:37.600]   to be able to develop their own mobile quizzes.
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:39.720]   What I said on my blog post is we've
[00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:42.400]   talked a lot about getting the electronic textbook.
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:43.240]   Screw that.
[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:44.680]   I want the electronic workbook.
[00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:46.400]   Yeah.
[00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:48.640]   OK, now I'm going to say this is HyperCard.
[00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:50.560]   That was the power of HyperCard.
[00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:53.040]   A lot of educators-- my dad used HyperCard
[00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:55.800]   to create a stack on Darwin that he used it.
[00:12:55.800 --> 00:12:56.800]   He's not a programmer.
[00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:58.240]   He's not even a computer buff.
[00:12:58.240 --> 00:12:58.640]   Yeah.
[00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:00.560]   But it was very valuable to him.
[00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:02.840]   And so this is-- I think that is the closest analogy.
[00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:05.880]   This could be the HyperCard for mobile.
[00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:08.360]   That really puts some pressure to Apple.
[00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:09.640]   It really does.
[00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:10.160]   Well, it was--
[00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:11.280]   I guess--
[00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:12.160]   Go ahead, Jen.
[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:15.000]   I was going to say, I get email from non-programmers
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.640]   all the time who said, I'm not a programmer,
[00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:17.800]   but I want to build a mobile app.
[00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:18.640]   Where do I start?
[00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:19.080]   Right.
[00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:20.960]   And up until now, my answer has been
[00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:22.360]   don't start with mobile app development,
[00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:23.320]   because you're either going to have
[00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:26.480]   to get into Objective-C with the iPhone, which is not easy.
[00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:29.920]   The iPhone IDE, I hear, is beautiful and fun to use.
[00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:30.280]   Yes, gorgeous.
[00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:31.400]   Very powerful.
[00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:33.400]   But you need to be a programmer to start with it.
[00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:35.920]   Incidentally, they have an interface builder that
[00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:38.040]   is essentially like this, a drag and drop.
[00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:38.960]   That's nice.
[00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:39.360]   You create the buttons.
[00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:40.280]   You create the interface.
[00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:41.480]   And then-- but you have to do the glue code.
[00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:42.880]   It's kind of like visual basic, too.
[00:13:42.880 --> 00:13:45.480]   You have to do the glue code or the button code
[00:13:45.480 --> 00:13:46.200]   to make fun shells--
[00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:46.200]   Right.
[00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:47.640]   --and handles events and that kind of thing.
[00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:48.140]   Right.
[00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:51.000]   But I mean, it's a nice interface developer.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:52.320]   And you know, the Eclipse--
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:55.080]   the Android SDK has-- there is a little bit
[00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:56.800]   of a visual component with XML files.
[00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:58.120]   You can see the layout.
[00:13:58.120 --> 00:14:01.400]   I'm still kind of not sure of myself with it.
[00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:03.800]   But I feel like this is something I would advise.
[00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:05.600]   Someone's interested in building a mobile app here.
[00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:07.640]   Here's something that you can start with.
[00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:08.840]   So I think it's a good thing.
[00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:10.440]   I'm definitely not one of the--
[00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:13.560]   I think the market has to fill up with some bad apps
[00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:16.720]   in order to create the market for the really good apps.
[00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:18.840]   I was at Barcamp last weekend, and there
[00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:20.280]   are a lot of Android phones there.
[00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:22.680]   And the conversations I was hearing about Android was,
[00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:25.200]   really, this task manager is pretty good.
[00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:26.720]   But I really like one that does this.
[00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:28.520]   And these are kind of the programmers
[00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:30.360]   that are going to identify the features or the things that
[00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:33.040]   are going to make the great apps kind of given
[00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:35.400]   the groundwork of the bad apps.
[00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:37.440]   And I think that that motivates developers
[00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:39.360]   to make the great apps, and then those will surface.
[00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:41.120]   And I think Android Market just has
[00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:44.320]   to fill out in order to create those opportunities
[00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:47.960]   and to kind of narrow them down so people will build them.
[00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:48.400]   You're right.
[00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:50.480]   Democrat with lower case D, Jeff.
[00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:51.840]   That's exactly right.
[00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:52.840]   No, that's exactly right.
[00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:54.600]   Generosity is an openness.
[00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:56.440]   Speaking of which, is there--
[00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:58.880]   because I haven't played with it yet--
[00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:01.440]   is there a--
[00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:04.800]   is it open and sufficient that if I create a good module--
[00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:06.720]   can people create new modules for this and share
[00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:08.880]   modules they've created?
[00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:09.840]   Do you know the gene?
[00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:11.800]   That's a very good question, and I'm not sure.
[00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:14.240]   They say, on the front page, Google engineers
[00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:16.600]   have created modules to do everything they want.
[00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:20.880]   It's for Gina to be able to program new modules
[00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:24.240]   that then dorks like me can actually put into something.
[00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:26.600]   Because that would be the better use of your talents, Gina,
[00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:31.400]   and the better use of my enthusiasm, shall we say.
[00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:34.520]   Yeah, letting anyone contribute building blocks
[00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:36.320]   would be fantastic.
[00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:38.200]   I mean, this is kind of Google's philosophy, right?
[00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:40.640]   I mean, they do generally let them do this.
[00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:41.920]   But I don't know if that's possible now.
[00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:43.440]   I don't believe so.
[00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:46.200]   It's based on open blocks, which is--
[00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:48.040]   They were great in the post-war saying
[00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:50.200]   that they were built on the shoulders of giants.
[00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:52.840]   Yes, it uses Open Blocks Java library
[00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:55.120]   for creating visual blocks programming sources.
[00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:59.200]   Open Blocks is an MIT project.
[00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:03.360]   So maybe, I mean, it depends on how much it uses Open Blocks.
[00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:04.560]   Oh, that's a good point.
[00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:06.000]   Could it just use stuff from scratch?
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.840]   Yeah.
[00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:10.520]   The compiler that translates the visual blocks language
[00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:13.560]   for implementation on Android uses the kawa language
[00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:15.560]   framework.
[00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:17.800]   kawa is a dialect of scheme.
[00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:19.920]   Wow.
[00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:21.480]   I don't even know what that is.
[00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:23.760]   Scheme is a Lisp variant.
[00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:24.640]   Oh, OK.
[00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:29.800]   So this is, you see, the MIT open roots here.
[00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:31.120]   Very interesting.
[00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:33.800]   So how do you see this competitively with Apple?
[00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:35.160]   I think it puts Apple on the spot.
[00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:39.440]   I think Apple-- but I would never imagine Apple--
[00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:42.000]   they can't do anything like this because it would flood them
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.440]   with things to approve.
[00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:47.200]   It's a back door into the App Store.
[00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:50.240]   Or it's a non-App Store.
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:51.240]   Apple's really a monster.
[00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:53.280]   It's kind of a sad commentary on Apple
[00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:57.400]   that, in fact, if they wanted to do a hypercard for iPhone,
[00:16:57.400 --> 00:17:00.120]   they really couldn't.
[00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:02.240]   That really isn't an option.
[00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:04.280]   And you know, smart of Google, perhaps,
[00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:08.000]   to recognize that and say, OK, we'll do it.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:13.280]   I'm feeling right now-- I've been using the iPhone
[00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:15.280]   since it came out solely.
[00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:18.920]   I sit and I look at my Nexus 1 on the show.
[00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:22.720]   But-- and I have to say, I've dropped five calls
[00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:25.440]   in the last two days, even with a case on the thing.
[00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:27.160]   I'm about to throw this thing through the window.
[00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:28.640]   I love so many things about it.
[00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:31.840]   But if it drops calls, I can't use it.
[00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:32.880]   So I'm very interested.
[00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:34.320]   Droid X comes out this week.
[00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:37.840]   That's the Verizon Motorola SQL to the Droid.
[00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:40.560]   Actually, there's a Droid 2, which is a direct SQL.
[00:17:40.560 --> 00:17:43.000]   Droid X is much more like an EVO with a 4.3 inch spoon.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:43.720]   I've touched it.
[00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:45.200]   I've held it very nice.
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:46.240]   Very nice.
[00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:47.600]   It's the Hummer of phones.
[00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:48.240]   That's what I'm calling.
[00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:49.680]   Guys, it's larger, but that's fine with me,
[00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:53.320]   because I got big, geeky hands, and it's all right.
[00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:54.440]   But I like the problem.
[00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:57.480]   I guess my only problem with it is, well, besides the issue
[00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:00.840]   that you and I always talk about about GSM versus CDMA.
[00:18:00.840 --> 00:18:03.840]   If I want to have two phones anyway,
[00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:05.840]   then I think I'd probably get the X,
[00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:10.400]   except I want the forward-facing camera.
[00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:11.080]   I think.
[00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:12.800]   Well, who are you going to call?
[00:18:12.800 --> 00:18:13.840]   I mean, well, that's true.
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:15.440]   But I just wasn't knowing what it can do.
[00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:17.120]   I think there's-- did you all watch--
[00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:20.160]   I blogged about this, the commercials that Apple did
[00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:23.320]   for the-- what's it called?
[00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:23.920]   FaceTime.
[00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:25.560]   FaceTime.
[00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:26.520]   Oh, the new commercials.
[00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:27.400]   I haven't seen the new ones.
[00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:28.320]   Yeah, it really struck me.
[00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:30.280]   I have all of them on my blog.
[00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:32.840]   It struck me as odd, because it was almost tragic.
[00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:35.000]   It's because at the end of these videos,
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.680]   you want them to be able to touch, but they can't.
[00:18:38.680 --> 00:18:42.160]   And yes, it's more intimate than a phone call,
[00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:46.280]   but that's what makes this evident about how it's still not.
[00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:48.480]   And there was something kind of sad about it to me.
[00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:52.400]   It was wacky, but it makes me wonder that the video online
[00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:55.200]   has been solely about broadcasting to the whole world,
[00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:58.800]   and now, in an instant, video became incredibly intimate.
[00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:02.600]   Yeah, so this is two people looking.
[00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:04.640]   Smellow?
[00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:08.480]   And now, I can't believe you're never going to smile.
[00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:09.680]   It's a guy trying to get somebody smile.
[00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:11.640]   Why are you going to make me sing?
[00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:13.880]   Shannon's never going to smile.
[00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:17.160]   She's going to go, "Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh."
[00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:20.160]   Hey, no, come on, they look good.
[00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:21.280]   That's your father, obviously.
[00:19:21.280 --> 00:19:22.120]   How do they feel?
[00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:22.840]   Shannon has braces.
[00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:23.080]   Yeah.
[00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:24.640]   Kind of weird.
[00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:25.680]   Well, you look beautiful.
[00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:27.520]   OK, that's pretty touching, but you're right.
[00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:29.240]   He's not there.
[00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:29.920]   Right.
[00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:31.440]   Dad's not there.
[00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:34.040]   In each one of these, even though it brought them closer,
[00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:36.600]   it only emphasized how the last mile was still there.
[00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:38.600]   [LAUGH]
[00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:41.480]   I guess we live in a world where we are so desperate to connect
[00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:44.920]   and we are so far away now that, uh, this is it.
[00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:46.720]   [LAUGH]
[00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:47.240]   Wait a minute.
[00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:48.120]   Where are you, Jeff?
[00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:48.960]   Gina, I can't--
[00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:49.480]   Right.
[00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:50.040]   I can't--
[00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:51.520]   [MUMBLING]
[00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:52.040]   I can't--
[00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:53.440]   That's all, that's all time.
[00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:55.120]   You're so far.
[00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:57.080]   But maybe this is the-- is this the world we live in now,
[00:19:57.080 --> 00:19:57.600]   or we don't?
[00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:58.760]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:19:58.760 --> 00:19:59.480]   Leo, I think that--
[00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:00.760]   Kind of depressing.
[00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:02.960]   You just got to depressing.
[00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:06.120]   The fact that this thing is different in some big ways,
[00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:07.520]   I still got to play with that.
[00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:09.520]   I still got to understand that.
[00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:11.880]   Whether it's through Apple or whether it's through Front-Facing
[00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:15.800]   Camera, but I think the front-facing camera kind of matters.
[00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:19.000]   Yeah, one of the other videos the woman getting a sonogram,
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.640]   obviously she's pregnant, and she switches the camera from her
[00:20:21.640 --> 00:20:25.560]   face to the sonogram scream to back, right?
[00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:26.400]   And that's--
[00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:27.920]   That was the killer.
[00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:28.320]   Yeah.
[00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:29.280]   That was a killer for me.
[00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:31.200]   That one is the one that really got me.
[00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:32.160]   All right, which one is that?
[00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:32.640]   I'm going to have to--
[00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:33.200]   Now I have to play it.
[00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:34.720]   It's the last one with the baby.
[00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:35.960]   Oh, no, it's not--
[00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:38.560]   On my blog, it's the fourth of the fifth, I think.
[00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:40.720]   It's not the guy with the beard.
[00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:41.920]   Two, three.
[00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:43.040]   It's not the hair you just played.
[00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:44.000]   All right, I think it is here.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.360]   Big news, I think that's it.
[00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:47.120]   All right, get ready.
[00:20:47.120 --> 00:20:49.040]   Free ad for Apple.
[00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:50.240]   No, that's not it.
[00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:51.600]   Hey, what's going on, sweetie?
[00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:52.280]   That's not it.
[00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:53.160]   She just got a haircut.
[00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:54.200]   She just got a haircut.
[00:20:54.200 --> 00:20:56.640]   Same topic, go back, because there's another one.
[00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:58.120]   Hair cut.
[00:20:58.120 --> 00:20:59.480]   Meet her.
[00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:01.120]   I don't think you have it embedded here.
[00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:01.920]   I don't have it on this one.
[00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:02.840]   Geez, that's weird.
[00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:03.920]   Huh.
[00:21:03.920 --> 00:21:04.440]   OK.
[00:21:04.440 --> 00:21:06.360]   Was it in the omnibus one, Gina, where there was a whole bunch
[00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:08.040]   of people doing different things?
[00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:10.400]   The one I was thinking of, the soldier
[00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:14.760]   was sitting on his bunk, presumably, in Afghanistan,
[00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:17.760]   or whatever, and talking to his wife, which just made me sad
[00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:19.240]   about the war, like I was like totally.
[00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:20.680]   Exactly, that too.
[00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:23.840]   I was just all filled up in my skull.
[00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:24.800]   Well, this is where--
[00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:26.560]   this is good advertising is emotional,
[00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:28.480]   so it's good advertising.
[00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:30.640]   That was what Tech Crunch was saying,
[00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:32.600]   that it's very mad at--
[00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:33.600]   It says, as if--
[00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:37.200]   MG Seagly writes, it says, "If Apple had hired Don Draper."
[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:37.640]   Exactly.
[00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:38.640]   Yeah.
[00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:40.360]   Well, they don't have to hire Don Draper.
[00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:42.520]   This is what every ad agency in the world is hoping for.
[00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:44.200]   And FaceTime lends itself to that.
[00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:45.760]   Ironically, I'm sorry.
[00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:47.800]   I don't think it's a technology that's going to take off.
[00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:49.400]   I just think it's not--
[00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:50.640]   it's Wi-Fi only.
[00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:51.640]   It's--
[00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:53.760]   Well, that's true, but I don't think there's technically--
[00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:54.320]   Please.
[00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:56.760]   Isn't there a front-facing camera phone moment?
[00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:58.600]   The Evo has it.
[00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:00.480]   I've got Anna Ravenscruff sitting in here.
[00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:01.320]   She's a big fan.
[00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:04.960]   Do you ever use the front-facing phone?
[00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:06.120]   Not yet, she says.
[00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:08.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:22:08.280 --> 00:22:09.160]   That's the problem.
[00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:13.440]   They've been front-facing cameras on Nokia phones for years.
[00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:15.520]   You can take a really good self-portrait.
[00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:17.240]   Yeah, that's what it's mostly.
[00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:18.840]   You can check your makeup.
[00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:20.160]   And I've done--
[00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:22.840]   I did a few FaceTime calls to people like Robert Scoble,
[00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:24.240]   and I haven't done anything since.
[00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:25.840]   Well, Leo, that says it all.
[00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:27.000]   Yeah, if that's who I'm calling--
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:27.640]   I'm talking off of Jordan.
[00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:28.400]   Exactly.
[00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:30.160]   What's the-- oh, good.
[00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:31.920]   I have to call Robert more.
[00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:33.320]   So--
[00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:34.160]   So--
[00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:36.080]   I mean, and I'll be honest, I'm not
[00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:38.520]   proselytizing that my friends and family--
[00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:41.960]   you'd think, OK, I got an iPhone 4.
[00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:43.720]   Wouldn't I want to talk my friends and family
[00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:46.080]   to getting an iPhone 4 so I could FaceTime them?
[00:22:46.080 --> 00:22:48.160]   And I can't-- no, of course not.
[00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:50.360]   So you're really going away from the iPhone here, man.
[00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:52.360]   You are the phone over--
[00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:54.360]   So wait, even when Abby goes to college?
[00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:56.080]   I asked her, you know what's funny?
[00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:58.600]   I said, you'll appreciate this, Jeff.
[00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:00.640]   I said, Abby, could you get a--
[00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:02.760]   I actually have an iPhone 4 in the box
[00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:04.960]   sitting that came here a couple of days ago.
[00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:06.120]   It was going to be for Abby.
[00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:08.280]   And she says-- I said, then we could FaceTime you.
[00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:10.880]   And that's the last thing she wants to do, by the way.
[00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:12.880]   Then we could FaceTime you.
[00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:13.960]   And she said--
[00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:15.080]   No, I can see her.
[00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:15.600]   I can see her.
[00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:16.280]   I don't know.
[00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:21.840]   She said, Dad, you have to decide, are we rich or are we poor?
[00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:25.040]   Because if we're rich, then if I carry an iPhone,
[00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:25.880]   it's a statement.
[00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:28.080]   And then I have to spend at that level.
[00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:32.480]   But if we're not rich, I want a cheap old feature phone.
[00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:35.120]   Because I don't want to get in the position where I have
[00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:38.080]   to keep up with my phone.
[00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:38.640]   Wow.
[00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:39.920]   She's strange that way.
[00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:40.840]   No, I love that.
[00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:42.760]   She's basically saying, Dad, you want to FaceTime me?
[00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:45.200]   Then you're going to have to up my alarm.
[00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:46.640]   I think that's where she was going with that.
[00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:47.320]   You're right.
[00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:48.600]   It's going to cost you, Dad.
[00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:49.480]   It's going to cost you.
[00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:53.840]   Yeah, I'll carry an iPhone, but it's going to cost you.
[00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:56.160]   Is this no little bollocks far behind?
[00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:57.280]   It's the entry draw.
[00:23:57.280 --> 00:23:58.000]   Oh, you're right.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.440]   Oh, you're right.
[00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:02.000]   You don't have that problem with Jeff, I hope.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:03.080]   I mean, Jake.
[00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:05.360]   So--
[00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:07.680]   Oh, he has expensive tasks and gadgets.
[00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:08.960]   Yeah, of course he does.
[00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:10.800]   Yeah, he's like you, he wants all the latest.
[00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:13.320]   So she's going to a hipster school.
[00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:15.400]   And she says, all the people will have iPhones.
[00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:16.600]   And I actually said, you know what?
[00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:18.800]   If it's really a hipster school,
[00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:21.960]   all the people will have Android phones.
[00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:24.080]   And actually, if it's a really, really hipster school,
[00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:28.480]   they'll all have old Nokia candy bar phone, retro phones.
[00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:29.800]   That's the really--
[00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:30.520]   I don't know, Gina.
[00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:31.600]   These are different flavors of hipster.
[00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:33.480]   When you go to New York City and you go down
[00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:37.240]   like to the meat packing quarter to the clubs,
[00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:40.720]   what phone are they carrying?
[00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:41.720]   Jeff.
[00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:43.080]   That was the beauty.
[00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:45.800]   That was the beauty.
[00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:47.440]   I can tell you, I guarantee you, they're not
[00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:49.400]   FaceTiming each other.
[00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:51.480]   That would be so uncool, right?
[00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:53.160]   You know, the fear is this is only
[00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:56.400]   going to make it a lot easier to do chat relax.
[00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:59.520]   By the way, there is-- this is something not on the yet
[00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:02.280]   on Android, although with this new Android inventor,
[00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:05.440]   probably just a few minutes away,
[00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:09.040]   there is a chat roulette clone for the iPhone called iChatter
[00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:13.160]   that I tried and regretted immediately.
[00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:14.720]   Was there--
[00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:15.520]   It uses FaceTime.
[00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:18.080]   The things we expected are there there.
[00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:20.200]   You want me to try it again?
[00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:21.080]   Oh, sure.
[00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:22.280]   No, no.
[00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:22.520]   I think--
[00:25:22.520 --> 00:25:25.000]   I saw a presentation when I was in Berlin.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:28.640]   Somebody did this with chat roulette on the huge screen.
[00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:30.400]   And she tried to get one.
[00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:31.080]   Wow, that's a surprise.
[00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:33.640]   Show themselves, I mean, show their face.
[00:25:33.640 --> 00:25:35.240]   And it was hilarious as soon as they realized--
[00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:36.440]   even though there was no face, there
[00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:38.240]   was a huge audience was watching them do this.
[00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:39.880]   Suddenly, boom, they went off.
[00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:40.800]   Oh, really?
[00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:41.280]   Yeah.
[00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:42.280]   Yeah.
[00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:43.280]   Well, you get that anyway.
[00:25:43.280 --> 00:25:45.800]   You get this-- there's this chat roulette rejection thing,
[00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:47.880]   which actually is very depressing if you're a guy on chat
[00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:49.200]   roulette, because it's boom, boom, boom.
[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:50.440]   They're not looking for guys.
[00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:53.200]   They're looking for young women that can scare.
[00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:55.680]   And so it's boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:58.760]   In fact, there's a great video on YouTube of a guy who
[00:25:58.760 --> 00:25:59.560]   didn't experiment.
[00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:01.080]   He demonstrated this.
[00:26:01.080 --> 00:26:03.160]   He sat in front of it, rejection after rejection.
[00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:05.320]   And he got his girlfriend to sit in front of it.
[00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:06.680]   Nice, long conversations.
[00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:08.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:09.640]   Of course.
[00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:12.640]   So what I'm holding out for is--
[00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:14.120]   because I have an XS1 on T-Mobile,
[00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:17.480]   I'm going to get this Galaxy S4 T-Mobile is going
[00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:18.520]   to be called the vibrant.
[00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:22.080]   They're going to be on every carrier, but it's four inches.
[00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:24.760]   So it's kind of in between the Nexus 1
[00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:29.080]   and the honkin' big EVO or Droid X.
[00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:33.800]   It's very thin, and it's got an AMOLED screen.
[00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:36.200]   It's actually a Samsung screen.
[00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:37.960]   No flash.
[00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:39.880]   Anyway, I'll give you an objective.
[00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:41.920]   I know you're going to T-Mobile because you already have the SIM,
[00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:43.760]   but my T-Mobile just--
[00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:44.960]   I love their model.
[00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:46.640]   I love the fact that they're unlimited.
[00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:48.240]   I love the fact that it's month to month.
[00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:51.280]   But the coverage is awful for me in New York.
[00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:53.320]   Well, this is telling.
[00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:57.680]   They're better in the Bay Area than AT&T.
[00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:00.280]   Well, that's their big opportunity for hate.
[00:27:00.280 --> 00:27:02.160]   Exactly.
[00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:02.920]   Exactly.
[00:27:02.920 --> 00:27:05.640]   I run into-- there are certain places in town here
[00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:08.480]   that I don't get a good signal.
[00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:10.880]   Actually, at Bar Camp, I didn't get a great signal.
[00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:13.560]   And everyone with their iPhones was like, the Wi-Fi was down.
[00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:14.640]   And everyone with their Wi-Fi's--
[00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:16.120]   or with their iPhones said, oh, well,
[00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:18.480]   well, can't you just do the portable hotspot thing?
[00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:21.600]   And I said, I don't have any coverage here.
[00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:22.000]   That's true.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.120]   What good is a portable hotspot?
[00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:23.760]   If you don't have three--
[00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:24.000]   Right.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.200]   If you don't have any coverage.
[00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:28.720]   I want to see Apple's commercial for video phone sex.
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:31.160]   Like, how are they going to make that emotional?
[00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:34.400]   Steve is saving us from sex, Jim.
[00:27:34.400 --> 00:27:34.640]   Right.
[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:36.040]   There's no porno in the world--
[00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:36.560]   Right.
[00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:37.040]   There's no sex.
[00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:37.720]   It's feasible.
[00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:38.200]   Right.
[00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:38.760]   You're right.
[00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:39.840]   You're right.
[00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:42.000]   It's not, by the way, my direct experience of Steve.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.320]   But I'll leave it at that.
[00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:45.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:47.280]   Maybe some time over drinks, I'll tell you this.
[00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:47.280]   Oh.
[00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:50.640]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:52.400]   The magic you made together.
[00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:55.400]   Not me with--
[00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:56.800]   No, no.
[00:27:56.800 --> 00:28:00.120]   I spent a long-- this was before he went to Apple.
[00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:01.720]   I've told this story before.
[00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:03.080]   He was still at Next.
[00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:06.560]   I spent a long weekend with him, his young wife,
[00:28:06.560 --> 00:28:09.320]   and their kids.
[00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:12.320]   Then now leave the rest of your imagination.
[00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:16.280]   So no, they're shaking their heads at me.
[00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:18.320]   I don't know what they mean by that.
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:20.040]   Let's take a break and come back.
[00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:21.520]   You can think.
[00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:23.360]   We have many more things to talk about.
[00:28:23.360 --> 00:28:26.200]   A new acquisition-- actually, I'm sorry, an acquisition
[00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:30.120]   that Google made some months ago comes to life on Picasa.
[00:28:30.120 --> 00:28:34.760]   We'll talk about Facebook and a lot more as we continue.
[00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:36.880]   This week in Google, Leo Le Porte here.
[00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:40.160]   The show brought to you, as always, by our friends at Citrix,
[00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:42.520]   who want to remind you about GoToMeeting.
[00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:45.160]   This is another one of those great Citrix products
[00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:48.880]   that built around their remote access software that saves you
[00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:51.480]   time, saves you money, saves you business,
[00:28:51.480 --> 00:28:53.440]   and has traveled in this case.
[00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:56.960]   I know many of us have spent time in business meetings,
[00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:59.920]   conference calls, where you just think,
[00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:02.640]   and, oh, this is the end of the world, or worse.
[00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:05.640]   You're stuck in the middle seat flying somewhere for a one-hour
[00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:07.160]   meeting thinking, why?
[00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:08.560]   Why are we doing this?
[00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:11.320]   American Express says the average cost of a business trip
[00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:15.440]   these days-- and they ought to know since they do a lot of expense
[00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:18.680]   meals-- is $1,000.
[00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:22.480]   For one trip, that's airfare, hotel, meals, all of that.
[00:29:22.480 --> 00:29:26.040]   Go to Meeting, less than 5% of it-- $49 a month,
[00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:29.400]   and you have all the meetings you want online.
[00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:31.200]   And it's so much better than a conference call,
[00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:32.320]   because it's visual.
[00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:35.000]   In fact, I would argue it's as effective as an in-person
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.200]   meeting, maybe even more so.
[00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:39.480]   Everyone sees your desktop on their computer screen.
[00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:41.640]   You can meet with up to 15 people at the same time,
[00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:44.280]   trade around the desktop so they can show you something
[00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:47.160]   and then you show them something.
[00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:49.320]   It includes voiceover, IP, and phone conferencing.
[00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:55.280]   That's part of the $49 a month, and it's absolutely secure, 128-bit SSL.
[00:29:55.280 --> 00:29:56.960]   Citrix knows how to do this stuff, right?
[00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:59.760]   Makes it easy to install, easy to invite people,
[00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:03.560]   and very easy for your attendees to join your meeting.
[00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:04.160]   That's important.
[00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:05.960]   If you're going to do a sales pitch,
[00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:08.520]   you can't have the client jump it through hoops.
[00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:10.920]   You're trying to convince the client to spend some money with you.
[00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:12.840]   In fact, go to Meeting and pressism.
[00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:13.440]   It's so easy.
[00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:14.680]   Here's what you do.
[00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:19.640]   Visit the site right now, go to Meeting.com/TwigT-W-I-G.
[00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:21.640]   You'll have it installed in a minute or two.
[00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:23.840]   The next time you want to have a conference call or a worse
[00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:27.120]   plan to get in the plane, just send an invitation, say,
[00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:30.360]   let's have a meeting online for see how this works.
[00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:32.720]   You can even do it while you're on a more in-conference call.
[00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:35.200]   Just say, please, do me a favor, go to Meeting.com.
[00:30:35.200 --> 00:30:36.440]   Here's the meeting ID.
[00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:39.480]   Let me show you the PowerPoint, the keynote presentation.
[00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:40.880]   It's so fantastic.
[00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:44.640]   Based on Java, by the way, go to Meeting.com/Twig.
[00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:47.200]   You give it a try for free for the next 30 days,
[00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:48.520]   and then you tell me what you think.
[00:30:48.520 --> 00:30:50.000]   Go to Meeting.com/Twig.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:53.160]   We thank them so much for their support of this week in Google.
[00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:56.440]   Apple's senior vice president, Scott Forstahl,
[00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:59.440]   creates a Twitter account.
[00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:02.560]   And it's news.
[00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:03.400]   Has he tweeted yet?
[00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:04.920]   I don't think so.
[00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:07.720]   But the point is that most of the time, you never--
[00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:10.480]   I don't think you ever see any Apple executives on Twitter.
[00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:12.400]   Do you ever see any Google executives on Twitter?
[00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:13.840]   There's a lot of Googlers on Twitter.
[00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:15.480]   Do you see Marissa's there?
[00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:15.800]   Is she--
[00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:16.280]   Does she tweet?
[00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:17.280]   Yeah.
[00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:17.480]   Yeah.
[00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:18.880]   And she responds to folks.
[00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:20.440]   She's actually quite responsive.
[00:31:20.440 --> 00:31:20.960]   Really?
[00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:23.320]   What is Forstahl's username?
[00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:25.320]   Let me see if I can find it here.
[00:31:25.320 --> 00:31:26.080]   This is a tech credit article.
[00:31:26.080 --> 00:31:29.920]   I'm on page 2.
[00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:33.320]   Just signed up for Twitter.
[00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:33.680]   Nothing.
[00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:35.400]   He hasn't posted diddly.
[00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:38.280]   Get short timely messages from Scott Forstahl.
[00:31:38.280 --> 00:31:39.280]   Oh, he's just Forstahl.
[00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:40.560]   It's Forstahl is his last name.
[00:31:40.560 --> 00:31:42.240]   That's easy.
[00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:44.040]   Verified account.
[00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:45.280]   Twitter says, yes, it's him.
[00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:45.920]   I don't know how they know.
[00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:47.160]   He hasn't tweeted.
[00:31:47.160 --> 00:31:51.080]   He's following one person, Conan O'Brien.
[00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:52.720]   This looks like a defensive.
[00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:55.800]   I don't want anybody to fake Steve Me account.
[00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:57.320]   Oh, maybe that's it.
[00:31:57.320 --> 00:31:58.040]   Yeah, right.
[00:31:58.040 --> 00:31:58.640]   I mean--
[00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:02.760]   Wishful thinking, Scott, nobody's going to fake Forstahl.
[00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:03.120]   Really?
[00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:03.600]   Seriously.
[00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:05.880]   I mean, to sign up and just make it a verified account
[00:32:05.880 --> 00:32:08.440]   and not post anything, that looks like a defensive move.
[00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:11.640]   25,000 people following him.
[00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:12.640]   That's crazy.
[00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:14.440]   Well, because TechCrunch reported it, right?
[00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:14.840]   Yeah.
[00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:15.520]   And I'm sure probably--
[00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:18.920]   What is the sound of one hand tweeting?
[00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:19.920]   Nothing.
[00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:21.840]   Dead silence.
[00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:23.320]   All right, that was a stinky story.
[00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:24.520]   I apologize.
[00:32:24.520 --> 00:32:28.120]   I'll find a better one for you.
[00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:32.240]   Microsoft is going to release a Bing search client for Android
[00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:35.840]   in the next six weeks, according to PC World Magazine.
[00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:37.600]   Have you been waiting for this with Bated Breath?
[00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:40.520]   Actually, the Bing app is pretty good on the iPhone.
[00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:41.520]   I don't use it, but--
[00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:44.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:49.800]   Henry Blodgett at Business Insider, very good New York--
[00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:51.320]   I love Henry Blodgett, yeah.
[00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:54.320]   So Henry said that Bing came after him and made him eat
[00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:55.840]   crow because Bing is growing.
[00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:58.960]   And so he find he gnashed on the crow and chunked a few bones.
[00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:00.240]   And then he said it's still--
[00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:00.760]   Stinks.
[00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:02.400]   --beated Bing is the same.
[00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:05.160]   Because he said that if you look at the numbers,
[00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:06.280]   they're making no money.
[00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:09.560]   They're spending every dollar and advertising to buy traffic.
[00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:09.760]   Right.
[00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:11.080]   That's not sustainable.
[00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:14.040]   7% growth, but it cost him.
[00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:15.720]   Right.
[00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:16.800]   This is an interesting one.
[00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:18.880]   Apple-- this just came across the wire.
[00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:22.320]   Apple has just acquired a second mapping service.
[00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:26.040]   Poly 9, they make 3D mapping software
[00:33:26.040 --> 00:33:28.640]   that looks a lot like Google Earth.
[00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:30.760]   Using satellite imagery, aerial photography,
[00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:34.440]   and geographic information of virtual atlas,
[00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:35.800]   you might remember that a year ago,
[00:33:35.800 --> 00:33:39.120]   Apple purchased PlaySpace, which is more
[00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:43.480]   like a Google Maps type product.
[00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:45.800]   We haven't seen them use either product on the iPhone,
[00:33:45.800 --> 00:33:46.640]   but it's interesting.
[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:49.320]   Do you think Apple--
[00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:50.880]   Trying to divorce themselves from Google Maps?
[00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:52.240]   Would you like to dump Google Maps?
[00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:55.520]   I mean, they put Bing on the iPhone.
[00:33:55.520 --> 00:33:59.200]   Apps are going to be the winner at local.
[00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:01.480]   Maps are going to be the primary UI,
[00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:03.560]   I think, to get you to local stuff.
[00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:04.520]   That's where the money is.
[00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:08.280]   OK, that's interesting.
[00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:11.440]   So when you want local, the first place you go is Maps.
[00:34:11.440 --> 00:34:13.320]   Well, no, no, I think I think--
[00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:14.520]   You don't go to a yell.
[00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:17.560]   I went to a restaurant today with my editor and agent
[00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:18.920]   in that call.
[00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:20.440]   We talked about you, Gina.
[00:34:20.440 --> 00:34:21.120]   And--
[00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:22.520]   Is that not a conflict of interest?
[00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:23.920]   Your editor is your agent?
[00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:24.960]   No, the student people.
[00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:25.800]   Oh, OK.
[00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:27.000]   Oh.
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:28.080]   Gina, you were confused too.
[00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:28.400]   Oh, good.
[00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:28.880]   I was--
[00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:29.400]   I was--
[00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:32.760]   I was going, oh, I'm kind of stupid running that guy.
[00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:34.640]   I miss thought you said one person.
[00:34:34.640 --> 00:34:35.440]   OK, your editor--
[00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:37.200]   There was no hyphener, my editor and your agent.
[00:34:37.200 --> 00:34:38.800]   But I looked at the restaurant before him,
[00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:41.080]   because my trick now is that I look at the menu
[00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:45.000]   before I get there so I don't have to stare down and be rude.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:45.840]   I was there for neurotic.
[00:34:45.840 --> 00:34:47.400]   Anyway, so I go to--
[00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:49.200]   I looked them up on Google, and the first link to me
[00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:52.960]   is not a link to their site, but is a Google Place page.
[00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:54.360]   And from there, I go to the map.
[00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:56.320]   And when I go-- when I'm out of town and I say, where should I
[00:34:56.320 --> 00:34:59.520]   eat, I use Maps to find out what's around me.
[00:34:59.520 --> 00:35:00.520]   That's the data that we're--
[00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:00.960]   We're the winning--
[00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:02.280]   So you start-- that's interesting.
[00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:06.440]   So you start with Google, but the link you get is a map.
[00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:07.520]   Look, I get it's the Place page.
[00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:09.240]   The Place page is a map.
[00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:12.280]   And-- or if I'm out and I say, well, gee, what am I going to
[00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:13.440]   eat?
[00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:14.400]   I go to the strange motel.
[00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:16.000]   I go to the maps, in that case.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:16.160]   And I--
[00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:16.600]   Really?
[00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:17.160]   Say what's around me.
[00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:18.080]   --to restaurants.
[00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:19.240]   Yeah.
[00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:20.840]   So that actually makes sense.
[00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:24.120]   The starting point is Google, which makes it hard for Apple
[00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:25.200]   to get into this business.
[00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:27.520]   The starting point's never going to be Apple.
[00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:30.000]   But if my phone says, here's where you are,
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:31.880]   what do you want around you?
[00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:35.040]   Then having their own map app is important, I think.
[00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:36.040]   How about you, Gina?
[00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:40.000]   Where do you start if you want location-based information?
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:41.840]   I've been really into four square lately.
[00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:43.160]   So I probably hit four square.
[00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:47.160]   I should also say that I am a woman of routine.
[00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:49.360]   So I'm often not in a situation where I'm in a strange
[00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:50.680]   city where I don't know where to go.
[00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:52.600]   So that doesn't happen too often.
[00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:54.520]   I have-- I travel between San Diego and New York,
[00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:56.400]   and I have my favorite places.
[00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:58.840]   But I will often look at four square just to see what's
[00:35:58.840 --> 00:36:02.680]   around me and where my friends are.
[00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:04.200]   Four square is interesting.
[00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:05.200]   Of course, that's interesting.
[00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:07.600]   You were a non-four square only a few weeks ago, Gina.
[00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:08.600]   I know.
[00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:11.000]   I did a total 180 on four square.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:13.440]   I really like it now.
[00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:14.760]   I like it a lot, actually.
[00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:17.040]   And now, several of my friends who live around here
[00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:17.920]   use it as well.
[00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:21.480]   So I guess that's kind of a deep feeling of like, oh, so and so,
[00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:24.080]   went to go see that movie, that kind of thing,
[00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:25.560]   kind of get that ambient.
[00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:27.440]   That's an important addition to search
[00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:30.200]   we've been talking a lot about over the last months, which
[00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:32.000]   is so Jeff, you're using raw search.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:35.960]   But what Gina wants is a social graph applied to this.
[00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:36.400]   Yeah.
[00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:38.400]   Around locale, at some point.
[00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:41.680]   Yeah, and that's-- so it's really not locale by itself,
[00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:43.040]   or search by itself.
[00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:46.600]   It's social graph as it applies to search or locale or both.
[00:36:46.600 --> 00:36:49.840]   This is the relevance signal to you that, oh, I know I'm
[00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:53.120]   your phone, I know where you are.
[00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:53.320]   Right.
[00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:55.440]   It's very interesting.
[00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:58.400]   More relevant signals is where the winning really comes in,
[00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:00.400]   and that's where social and geo really matter together.
[00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:03.200]   This is where, frankly, Apple is not a player
[00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:05.320]   because they're not a strong web presence.
[00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:07.320]   But Facebook and Google and companies that really
[00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:09.880]   live on the web, that's their players.
[00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:12.840]   You can't just say, oh, I'm going to be a player in this space
[00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:14.760]   and buy a bunch of companies.
[00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:20.080]   You need to have people using you on the web.
[00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:20.760]   I think so.
[00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:22.120]   Right?
[00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:23.960]   So it makes it very difficult.
[00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:27.240]   I bought a new machine, I bought a new 13-inch Mac,
[00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:30.120]   and I switched over, and I haven't put all my data in there
[00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:30.720]   yet.
[00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:33.720]   So my RSS reader, I haven't been using it,
[00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:36.640]   so I actually just switched to Google Reader.
[00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:37.880]   Yeah, I have to.
[00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:41.120]   And I just find the used pin tabs.
[00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:42.640]   I'm behind.
[00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:43.320]   But--
[00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:44.320]   Wait a minute, wait a minute.
[00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:45.920]   You better tell us what's pin tabs.
[00:37:45.920 --> 00:37:48.680]   On Chrome, you can pin a tab.
[00:37:48.680 --> 00:37:49.640]   Oh, OK.
[00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:50.800]   So it's always there, right?
[00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:52.480]   So I don't have to do this problem where I was always
[00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:54.280]   closing the Macs of that layer, and to move them around,
[00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:55.280]   or what kind of crap.
[00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:57.000]   But I just--
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:37:58.120]   three years ago.
[00:37:58.120 --> 00:37:59.800]   I got to talk to Gina more.
[00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:01.080]   Yeah.
[00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:02.920]   So how do I pin this tab?
[00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:06.120]   Yeah, I'm looking at my Macs.
[00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:06.600]   And I don't--
[00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:08.000]   In Chrome, you go to the tab and you
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:09.560]   and you control click on it.
[00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:10.040]   There it is.
[00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:12.320]   Oh, control click on it.
[00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:14.920]   And pin tab is always there.
[00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:15.280]   Beautiful.
[00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:17.080]   Pin tab.
[00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:20.160]   So now Buzz Machine will always be right there.
[00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:22.160]   Well, it should be, Leo.
[00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:22.840]   Damn, that's good.
[00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:24.400]   And it shrinks it down to the favicon,
[00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:25.200]   which is my favorite.
[00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:25.600]   I love that.
[00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:25.920]   Right.
[00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:27.080]   But you know what, Jeff, you've
[00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:29.080]   got to work on your favicon.
[00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:29.880]   Right.
[00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:30.680]   What the hell is that?
[00:38:30.680 --> 00:38:32.560]   It looks like a piece of paper.
[00:38:32.560 --> 00:38:34.560]   Well, I'm always a blank slate of paper.
[00:38:34.560 --> 00:38:36.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:37.480]   Symbology.
[00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:38.280]   Symbology.
[00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:40.920]   He's a blank sheet.
[00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:41.800]   Well, that's handy.
[00:38:41.800 --> 00:38:42.720]   OK, so you--
[00:38:42.720 --> 00:38:43.280]   so I'm sorry.
[00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:44.280]   I do rails.
[00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:46.200]   All I'm doing is that isn't going to--
[00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:48.840]   so I'm going more and more away from apps
[00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:50.360]   to straight web stuff.
[00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:51.880]   And it does work.
[00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:55.560]   I have to say, news reading is a very good example of that.
[00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:57.280]   I've tried every news reader under the sun,
[00:38:57.280 --> 00:38:59.200]   and I end up back on reader.
[00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:01.280]   You've got Google.com every time.
[00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:03.560]   Now, the world is awesome.
[00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:05.200]   Partly because it doesn't have to load.
[00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:08.520]   I mean, a lot of these apps, they're going, OK, hold on.
[00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:10.320]   Let me go out and get the latest headlines.
[00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:11.800]   Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:12.160]   And--
[00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:14.000]   Well, the only other thing is I never-- because I never
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:17.440]   used it, I never-- I have some thousand people following me,
[00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:19.160]   and they're getting nothing.
[00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:21.960]   And now RSS just became social for me, too,
[00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:23.440]   which was a little bit full.
[00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:24.600]   No, I have to say.
[00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:28.920]   And also, reader has really improved its front page.
[00:39:28.920 --> 00:39:32.880]   So there's actually some useful stuff right at the beginning.
[00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:37.480]   I like the What's Hot in Google reader feed, which
[00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:39.800]   is a feed of its own.
[00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:40.640]   And then you're right.
[00:39:40.640 --> 00:39:43.600]   Again, this is social applied to news.
[00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:45.440]   So now, I'll go back to your question later.
[00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:47.600]   I'm not sure where we stand now.
[00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:52.720]   Is Apple in a worse position with maps and apps versus web?
[00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:55.680]   On mobile, it's different.
[00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:56.440]   Right, you can't.
[00:39:56.440 --> 00:39:57.280]   You're not going to go to--
[00:39:57.280 --> 00:39:59.480]   On mobile, I do use reader.
[00:39:59.480 --> 00:40:05.000]   I'm not going to use a web page, based app.
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   You're not.
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:07.040]   No.
[00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:08.000]   Do you?
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   No.
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:12.360]   Do you know how often you ever run for the browser?
[00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:13.360]   On my phone.
[00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:15.400]   You're on your Android.
[00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:16.400]   Hmm.
[00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:17.640]   Oh, I use the--
[00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:18.560]   I shouldn't have done that.
[00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:19.360]   Not that often.
[00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:22.120]   I mean, I normally start from the search widget
[00:40:22.120 --> 00:40:25.160]   on the front page if I need to look something up on Google.
[00:40:25.160 --> 00:40:27.400]   And I load think tank to check on it.
[00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:29.280]   But no, mostly I use apps.
[00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:29.880]   You're right.
[00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:31.160]   That's interesting.
[00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:31.680]   Yeah.
[00:40:31.680 --> 00:40:32.480]   That's a different--
[00:40:32.480 --> 00:40:34.160]   This is what's changing.
[00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:40.680]   Right, so if Apple has best signals into its own map app
[00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:46.360]   and its large installed user base and so in advertising,
[00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:48.800]   does it have to kill Google Maps to do that?
[00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:49.640]   No, I don't think it does.
[00:40:49.640 --> 00:40:53.000]   I think it just advantages themselves.
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:56.480]   So this is why Apple's strong interest is closed, really,
[00:40:56.480 --> 00:41:02.400]   because that's the ecosystem that they survive in.
[00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:04.480]   Open is a bad ecosystem for Apple
[00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:06.840]   because they can't compete against Google.
[00:41:06.840 --> 00:41:08.240]   Right.
[00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:11.720]   So really, this is probably the force that's pushing Apple away.
[00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:14.360]   I mean, I think, hereditorly, Apple would prefer to be open.
[00:41:14.360 --> 00:41:17.600]   I don't know about Steve, but Apple had been open.
[00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:20.440]   And I think what's happening is they see they cannot come--
[00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:22.920]   this is probably is the Google effect on Apple.
[00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:24.720]   Well, I go back to the hypercard thing.
[00:41:24.720 --> 00:41:29.800]   Apple always was a tool that enabled people to create.
[00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:31.720]   Well, now when you get to the most important thing,
[00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:35.400]   create apps, Apple says, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:41:35.400 --> 00:41:37.160]   You can't do that because you might make crappy,
[00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:38.520]   you might make poor.
[00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:39.920]   And you can't do that.
[00:41:39.920 --> 00:41:42.680]   So that's what goes away from the Apple DNA, I think.
[00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:45.720]   Apple was always the great creators tool.
[00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:46.960]   And now it's not.
[00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:50.200]   It's a consumption tool, which is the problem I had with the iPad.
[00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:51.720]   It was consumption more than creation.
[00:41:51.720 --> 00:41:52.840]   Mind and focus, sir?
[00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:53.520]   Yes.
[00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:57.240]   And I've come around to your way of thinking, actually.
[00:41:57.240 --> 00:42:00.200]   Well, you aren't really having a bad Apple day.
[00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:01.240]   You are.
[00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:03.560]   I was asked about the iPad and how much you're doing.
[00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:05.640]   I like the iPad, and I love it.
[00:42:05.640 --> 00:42:07.680]   Just as you love candy, it's not good for you,
[00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:08.960]   but you might love it.
[00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:10.600]   It really is candy.
[00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:15.160]   And I actually had this debated food camp with--
[00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:17.240]   I'm embarrassed to say the guy who created the Popular Science
[00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:22.120]   app, which is a really good example,
[00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:25.160]   because here's a beautiful application.
[00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:27.000]   Exactly what the publishers--
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:28.680]   and you've talked about this, Jeff, prefer.
[00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:31.040]   The links are inward.
[00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:32.320]   Don't take you out there.
[00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:33.440]   There's no link economy.
[00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:34.920]   We control the space.
[00:42:34.920 --> 00:42:36.280]   You're reading our stuff.
[00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:37.520]   And I found it unreadable.
[00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:40.560]   It was beautiful, but I couldn't read the content.
[00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:42.320]   It was like, no, this isn't what I want.
[00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:44.240]   And I realized that Jeff was right all along.
[00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:47.960]   What I really want is a web page with links in it.
[00:42:47.960 --> 00:42:48.880]   You're right.
[00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:50.000]   And I told him that.
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.560]   I said, I think I probably used your word regressive.
[00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:58.000]   This is a step backwards in the open link economy.
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:42:59.760]   And I still love the iPad.
[00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:01.160]   But the iPad's got a browser.
[00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:02.440]   You could still use the browser.
[00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:04.200]   It's not like you--
[00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:06.120]   You're more likely to use the browser there
[00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:07.200]   than you are on the phone.
[00:43:07.200 --> 00:43:08.120]   Yes, that's true.
[00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:09.880]   The phone in the browser just isn't that good,
[00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:11.040]   so that you're right.
[00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:12.400]   That's where we see the split.
[00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:14.840]   The app world and the closed world versus the web world.
[00:43:14.840 --> 00:43:18.840]   Now, then is Google at a disadvantage because it's
[00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:19.360]   absolute.
[00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:22.160]   They may be getting many of them or not as good.
[00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:25.400]   And it's thinking in terms of Chrome,
[00:43:25.400 --> 00:43:28.400]   in terms of browser-based applications.
[00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:29.960]   And we don't go to the browser.
[00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:32.120]   The truth is I'm looking at reader on the iPad.
[00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:35.720]   And it's very capable in the browser.
[00:43:35.720 --> 00:43:36.560]   It's very capable.
[00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:39.480]   It does kind of the same things that it
[00:43:39.480 --> 00:43:42.520]   would do on a desktop for the iPad anyway.
[00:43:42.520 --> 00:43:43.200]   It's fine.
[00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:45.480]   It's just too small for the phone.
[00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:48.960]   The phone-- this is really interesting.
[00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:51.960]   Apple's interest is in keeping this display small.
[00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:55.680]   Because that's another thing you need for apps to succeed.
[00:43:55.680 --> 00:43:58.880]   You need a constrained environment.
[00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:02.600]   Not in their interest to have a nice big display on this thing.
[00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:04.040]   In fact, that's exactly what they did.
[00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:05.680]   They said, well, we'll keep it small.
[00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:07.960]   We'll just make it higher resolution, make it look pretty.
[00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:09.240]   But we're not going to make it big.
[00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:12.040]   Because, well, that's the iPad for one thing.
[00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:17.680]   But also, it kind of obviates our advantage with apps.
[00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:18.920]   Very interesting.
[00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:22.040]   I love this show because I learned something every time.
[00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:26.280]   Tom Formsky, this just came out also, writing--
[00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:28.720]   and thanks to the chat room for pointing this out--
[00:44:28.720 --> 00:44:31.320]   writing on ZDNet says-- and this is
[00:44:31.320 --> 00:44:33.040]   from an article in the Financial Times that
[00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:35.000]   requires subscription behind the paywall.
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:35.960]   So I ain't reading it.
[00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:39.760]   But I'll read Tom's article on this.
[00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:45.800]   Google admits employees change index ratings.
[00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:47.320]   Companies with a high page rank are
[00:44:47.320 --> 00:44:49.240]   in a strong position to move into new markets
[00:44:49.240 --> 00:44:52.200]   by pointing to this new information from their existing
[00:44:52.200 --> 00:44:52.520]   sites.
[00:44:52.520 --> 00:44:55.800]   They can pass on some of their existing search engine
[00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:59.760]   aura-- Google Juice, to use Robert Scobel's term--
[00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:03.360]   guaranteeing them more prominence.
[00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:05.720]   Google's Mr. Singal calls this problem--
[00:45:05.720 --> 00:45:07.080]   the problem of brand recognition,
[00:45:07.080 --> 00:45:09.480]   where companies who's standing is based on their success
[00:45:09.480 --> 00:45:12.800]   in one area uses to venture out into another class of information,
[00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:14.960]   which they may not be rich at.
[00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:17.040]   That, of course, is how the market works, too.
[00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:19.440]   I mean, a company like Apple becomes strong in one area,
[00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:22.600]   uses its success in that area to branch into other areas.
[00:45:22.600 --> 00:45:23.640]   Google doesn't like that.
[00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:28.080]   So they use human raters to assess the quality of individual
[00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:31.960]   sites in order to counter this effect.
[00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:34.240]   I've been saying that for quite a long time.
[00:45:34.240 --> 00:45:36.080]   I've really acknowledged having human--
[00:45:36.080 --> 00:45:37.040]   I've heard them say it.
[00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:38.960]   They've acknowledged having human raters
[00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:42.600]   to rate the quality of search results.
[00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:44.280]   These employees have the power to promote,
[00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:46.880]   or even completely erase the site from the Google index.
[00:45:46.880 --> 00:45:49.040]   Well, we knew that because, of course, if you game Google,
[00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:51.480]   you'll get erased as well.
[00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:54.760]   I always thought, though, that the humans who do things
[00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:57.600]   at Google, shocking that they're humans are going to do things,
[00:45:57.600 --> 00:46:02.080]   that they don't necessarily demo individual sites,
[00:46:02.080 --> 00:46:04.320]   but that they make observations to help
[00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:07.560]   tweak the algorithm overall.
[00:46:07.560 --> 00:46:09.200]   This sounds like there are editors who are--
[00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:12.680]   They're looking at sites and saying, no, that's not it.
[00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:13.520]   Right, right.
[00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:15.280]   We're going to rank you lower.
[00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:16.560]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:46:16.560 --> 00:46:18.080]   I mean, it sounded-- I always understood
[00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:21.120]   that it was always just about tweaking the algorithm.
[00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:22.160]   But this sounds more ethical as well.
[00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:23.520]   But they still say that, necessarily.
[00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:25.160]   Oh, this was a fail.
[00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:27.440]   This shouldn't be there, so I'm going to tell the algorithm.
[00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:28.200]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:46:28.200 --> 00:46:29.840]   You're going to put that there because I was all there.
[00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:31.200]   But there's a difference between algorithm.
[00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:32.200]   Well--
[00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:34.120]   This is between killing and promoting.
[00:46:34.120 --> 00:46:36.960]   But there's also a difference between a site by site
[00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:39.480]   modification and a modification in the algorithm.
[00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:41.760]   So Larry Page always said this.
[00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:42.800]   He told me.
[00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:43.880]   He said, I go to the end.
[00:46:43.880 --> 00:46:45.120]   I go to the end of the search results.
[00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:47.160]   And I look at the stuff that falls off the edge.
[00:46:47.160 --> 00:46:50.480]   And we tweak the algorithm for that.
[00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:51.840]   Of course they do that.
[00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:52.640]   This is different.
[00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:57.480]   This is a guy looking at a site and saying, no, that's
[00:46:57.480 --> 00:46:58.560]   not fixing the algorithm.
[00:46:58.560 --> 00:47:01.160]   That's saying the algorithm gave me the wrong result.
[00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:03.960]   The algorithm is learning from that and saying--
[00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:04.960]   Right.
[00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:06.600]   Like when you report spam, right?
[00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:08.120]   You say, get this email out of my inbox.
[00:47:08.120 --> 00:47:08.960]   Yeah, Matt does that.
[00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:09.160]   Right?
[00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:09.960]   Matt cuts does that.
[00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:12.440]   He says, OK, this is clearly a spammy site.
[00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:14.640]   They probably respond directly to that site as well as saying
[00:47:14.640 --> 00:47:16.600]   to the algorithm.
[00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:18.880]   Maybe you better fix this part.
[00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:19.360]   Right.
[00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:20.640]   I mean, I'm always a Google fanboy,
[00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:23.800]   but I don't know what they're treating this as a big scandal.
[00:47:23.800 --> 00:47:26.960]   Google has employees.
[00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:29.960]   Of course, you have to deal with the results of the algorithm
[00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:32.120]   to make the algorithm better.
[00:47:32.120 --> 00:47:34.600]   Now, Scott Kleiland is saying that this is the first time
[00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:38.120]   Google has admitted this.
[00:47:38.120 --> 00:47:40.480]   There's some fine point here that I'm missing,
[00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:42.560]   but I have heard it from Googlers-Mals
[00:47:42.560 --> 00:47:44.160]   that they have people who check.
[00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:46.000]   I think we talked about it on the show a long time ago.
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:48.840]   Jeff, you maybe you knew something no one else knew.
[00:47:48.840 --> 00:47:50.040]   God knows.
[00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:54.320]   So today Google-- this is reading from Scott Kleiland's
[00:47:54.320 --> 00:47:55.440]   blog, the precursor blog.
[00:47:55.440 --> 00:47:57.840]   Today, Google publicly admitted for the first time
[00:47:57.840 --> 00:47:59.760]   that it's purported neutral and unbiased search
[00:47:59.760 --> 00:48:03.080]   algorithm is not completely automated or computer algorithmic.
[00:48:03.080 --> 00:48:08.840]   I meet Singal as the guy there.
[00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:10.320]   Oh, I met him.
[00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:12.440]   Mr. Singal calls the problem of brand recognition.
[00:48:12.440 --> 00:48:13.880]   Well, we talked about this.
[00:48:13.880 --> 00:48:17.600]   And then this from Google's website, he quotes,
[00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:18.720]   "10 things we know to be true.
[00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:21.320]   We never manipulate rankings to put our partners higher
[00:48:21.320 --> 00:48:24.040]   in our search results, and no one can buy a better page rank."
[00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:25.600]   Well, that's not-- this isn't--
[00:48:25.600 --> 00:48:26.100]   Right.
[00:48:26.100 --> 00:48:26.600]   That's not that.
[00:48:26.600 --> 00:48:27.600]   That's not that.
[00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:29.520]   Our users trust our objectivity.
[00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:30.520]   I don't think that that--
[00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:34.080]   So Kleiland has a thing for Google and is constantly
[00:48:34.080 --> 00:48:37.320]   listening and on emails every day playing about them.
[00:48:37.320 --> 00:48:38.440]   Listen, maybe right.
[00:48:38.440 --> 00:48:39.000]   I don't know.
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:41.720]   There's maybe manipulation of a higher form
[00:48:41.720 --> 00:48:43.520]   than I'm aware of.
[00:48:43.520 --> 00:48:46.000]   All I'm suggesting here is that they've always
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:50.920]   had humans doing quality checks on search results.
[00:48:50.920 --> 00:48:53.720]   And as a result, that affects sites.
[00:48:53.720 --> 00:48:57.080]   They've also always had humans decree in spam.
[00:48:57.080 --> 00:48:59.720]   So here's the-- he does raise this point, which I think
[00:48:59.720 --> 00:49:01.000]   is legitimate to raise.
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:03.840]   OK, so there is somebody making these decisions,
[00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:07.760]   and there are antitrust suits filed over it.
[00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:09.440]   Antitrust authorities, he said, should
[00:49:09.440 --> 00:49:13.280]   want to know how these human raters maintain objectivity
[00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:15.960]   and what internal controls are in place for this human process
[00:49:15.960 --> 00:49:17.600]   not to be abused.
[00:49:17.600 --> 00:49:18.680]   That's reasonable.
[00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:19.440]   Yeah, I think it is.
[00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:21.040]   I think the real problem Google's had--
[00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:22.720]   I've said it on this show--
[00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:26.960]   is that they are godlike there.
[00:49:26.960 --> 00:49:30.440]   They have godlike-- if Google argues that normally they
[00:49:30.440 --> 00:49:32.080]   have an open marketplace of advertising,
[00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:34.320]   and, hey, succeed or fail based on the quality of your ad
[00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:36.440]   and the clicks and the price of those ads.
[00:49:36.440 --> 00:49:41.320]   That's not true when it comes to deciding that a site is spam.
[00:49:41.320 --> 00:49:43.240]   So when they've gotten the suits, it's from a site that says,
[00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:45.200]   no, I'm a directory not spam site.
[00:49:45.200 --> 00:49:46.320]   How dare you?
[00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:50.280]   And there's a difference there.
[00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:56.920]   So-- sorry, I just had something weird on my computer.
[00:49:56.920 --> 00:50:00.560]   So when Google says, no, no, no, you're spam,
[00:50:00.560 --> 00:50:02.160]   they are godlike saying that.
[00:50:02.160 --> 00:50:04.440]   And I have argued for a long time, no one
[00:50:04.440 --> 00:50:07.840]   listens, that Google should have a jury of peers.
[00:50:07.840 --> 00:50:10.680]   It's in no one's interest to have bad search results
[00:50:10.680 --> 00:50:11.520]   and have crap come up.
[00:50:11.520 --> 00:50:14.520]   At the very least, Google needs to be less opaque about this,
[00:50:14.520 --> 00:50:17.400]   more transparent about this, because it's a black box right now.
[00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:20.160]   You just-- index goes in, sites go in.
[00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:22.360]   But the argument there is, is you find out the tricks.
[00:50:22.360 --> 00:50:24.040]   You'll only be better at gaming it.
[00:50:24.040 --> 00:50:26.280]   I think it's in these cases of dispute
[00:50:26.280 --> 00:50:28.600]   rather than having Google employees adjudicate them
[00:50:28.600 --> 00:50:29.680]   and get themselves in this trouble,
[00:50:29.680 --> 00:50:31.640]   because they're just so damn big.
[00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:35.400]   I think if you had 10 generally trusted business people
[00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:41.080]   able to review this and say anonymous, I mean,
[00:50:41.080 --> 00:50:43.400]   identity hidden so they can't be bribed.
[00:50:43.400 --> 00:50:46.320]   But to say, now, Google, you're wrong on that one.
[00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:47.560]   That one looks OK to me.
[00:50:47.560 --> 00:50:51.240]   And if enough agree, then it stays up.
[00:50:51.240 --> 00:50:53.480]   This is an interesting-- this is an interesting--
[00:50:53.480 --> 00:50:54.800]   and of course, you're--
[00:50:54.800 --> 00:50:56.880]   it's completely meaningless if it's being.
[00:50:56.880 --> 00:50:59.880]   It's much more meaningful because it's Google.
[00:50:59.880 --> 00:51:02.120]   And they have so much power.
[00:51:02.120 --> 00:51:05.960]   They're vulnerable to accusations of antitrust
[00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:07.240]   just from the power.
[00:51:07.240 --> 00:51:11.000]   So the way to get around this monopoly accusation
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:13.400]   is to say, yeah, we're huge, but you're rightly,
[00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:15.800]   we are as transparent as we can be wherever it is.
[00:51:15.800 --> 00:51:19.320]   A, B, the marketplace handles these decisions.
[00:51:19.320 --> 00:51:20.760]   We don't.
[00:51:20.760 --> 00:51:23.440]   And C, when there are disputes, here's
[00:51:23.440 --> 00:51:26.680]   a dispute resolution mechanism so it can be no complaints.
[00:51:26.680 --> 00:51:28.480]   So you make complaints, Phil, but sorry,
[00:51:28.480 --> 00:51:30.320]   this is the way it works.
[00:51:30.320 --> 00:51:32.960]   I also think that it's kind of a false--
[00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:36.160]   we shouldn't differentiate between it's the algorithm,
[00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:38.120]   so it's good or it's humans.
[00:51:38.120 --> 00:51:39.160]   And it's potentially bad.
[00:51:39.160 --> 00:51:41.240]   I mean, humans created the algorithm.
[00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:43.320]   The algorithm is just a conglomeration
[00:51:43.320 --> 00:51:45.680]   of human judgments over time, right?
[00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:47.960]   That the computers have just been programmed
[00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:50.520]   to make automatically.
[00:51:50.520 --> 00:51:52.880]   And I think that it's reasonable--
[00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:53.720]   You're not--
[00:51:53.720 --> 00:51:54.440]   You're just dramatic.
[00:51:54.440 --> 00:51:57.000]   The algorithm is a statement of prejudices.
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:57.680]   Yeah.
[00:51:57.680 --> 00:51:58.160]   Yeah.
[00:51:58.160 --> 00:51:59.440]   I mean, it is.
[00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:01.880]   The algorithm is just automated human judgment.
[00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:03.080]   Human judgment automated.
[00:52:03.080 --> 00:52:03.600]   That's good.
[00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:04.600]   That's good.
[00:52:04.600 --> 00:52:05.920]   You're saying--
[00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:07.360]   It requires a programmer to say this,
[00:52:07.360 --> 00:52:10.720]   because those of us who are not programmers
[00:52:10.720 --> 00:52:13.280]   think that there's something completely objective
[00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:14.720]   and magical about this.
[00:52:14.720 --> 00:52:16.480]   And it's math.
[00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:18.080]   There's no humans involved.
[00:52:18.080 --> 00:52:19.200]   It's math.
[00:52:19.200 --> 00:52:21.360]   Yeah, no.
[00:52:21.360 --> 00:52:23.720]   It's an expression of a human intent.
[00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:25.360]   Yes, yes, exactly.
[00:52:25.360 --> 00:52:28.680]   The algorithm is an expression of the engineers, for sure.
[00:52:28.680 --> 00:52:30.000]   Very good point.
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:30.920]   Very good.
[00:52:30.920 --> 00:52:33.920]   It's David Weinberger, who always says brilliant things.
[00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:37.800]   But he does a great spiel about Dewey Decimal System
[00:52:37.800 --> 00:52:40.760]   and how Mr. Dewey had his prejudices,
[00:52:40.760 --> 00:52:42.640]   and they are evident in the system.
[00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:45.600]   There's like 100 numbers for Christianity
[00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:49.480]   and two for Judaism and one for everything else.
[00:52:49.480 --> 00:52:52.520]   And the system brings forward the prejudices.
[00:52:52.520 --> 00:52:54.960]   And I think there's-- I've never seen studies done
[00:52:54.960 --> 00:52:58.520]   about trying to back into search and algorithm
[00:52:58.520 --> 00:52:59.920]   and things like that to try to say,
[00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:02.080]   to suss out what are those judgments?
[00:53:02.080 --> 00:53:07.000]   How can you learn the judgments from what it does
[00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:10.040]   and recognize the prejudices it then naturally has?
[00:53:10.040 --> 00:53:14.000]   Very interesting.
[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:16.080]   It's just circled around to our conversation
[00:53:16.080 --> 00:53:18.280]   about mobile versus the web.
[00:53:18.280 --> 00:53:23.240]   Steve Rubell writing in At Age writes an interesting article
[00:53:23.240 --> 00:53:25.880]   called, "It's time to prepare for the end of the web as we know it."
[00:53:25.880 --> 00:53:27.600]   He quotes a Morgan Stanley report that says,
[00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:30.840]   "Within five years, global internet consumption
[00:53:30.840 --> 00:53:34.160]   on mobile devices will surpass that activity on PCs."
[00:53:34.160 --> 00:53:37.640]   We're clearly seeing that trend, where, away from PCs
[00:53:37.640 --> 00:53:38.520]   and towards mobile.
[00:53:38.520 --> 00:53:40.240]   But what's a mobile device?
[00:53:40.240 --> 00:53:43.400]   Well, the iPad, the mobile device.
[00:53:43.400 --> 00:53:45.640]   Your five-inch Dell thing, a mobile device,
[00:53:45.640 --> 00:53:47.760]   is your car a mobile device?
[00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:48.840]   Or is it a whole new kind of device?
[00:53:48.840 --> 00:53:50.960]   I think that's the problem with this discussion
[00:53:50.960 --> 00:53:53.440]   of declaring things dead, is that--
[00:53:53.440 --> 00:53:54.360]   Well, there's a--
[00:53:54.360 --> 00:53:56.400]   There's a new definition there.
[00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:57.280]   There's a continuum.
[00:53:57.280 --> 00:54:01.880]   But I think that even something as big as an iPad,
[00:54:01.880 --> 00:54:03.360]   it's not the same as a notebook.
[00:54:03.360 --> 00:54:04.960]   And it is a different experience.
[00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:07.200]   But certainly on a phone.
[00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:09.680]   The deal is the same thing when we switch from desktops
[00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:10.640]   to notebooks.
[00:54:10.640 --> 00:54:11.680]   We're there now.
[00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:12.680]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:54:12.680 --> 00:54:13.520]   We've already done it.
[00:54:13.520 --> 00:54:16.080]   And so was that really such a big deal?
[00:54:16.080 --> 00:54:18.040]   Well, we've got a lot--
[00:54:18.040 --> 00:54:22.400]   Don't these small devices, as we were talking about earlier,
[00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:24.720]   favor apps over the web?
[00:54:24.720 --> 00:54:26.200]   Yes, that's true.
[00:54:26.200 --> 00:54:26.720]   That's true.
[00:54:26.720 --> 00:54:27.560]   But there's some line--
[00:54:27.560 --> 00:54:29.360]   So really, that's the trend.
[00:54:29.360 --> 00:54:30.280]   There is a continuum.
[00:54:30.280 --> 00:54:36.760]   But we're also going to go to things like voice commands more.
[00:54:36.760 --> 00:54:39.040]   And we may do that with our laptops and our desktops, too.
[00:54:39.040 --> 00:54:40.480]   All I'm trying to say is that--
[00:54:40.480 --> 00:54:42.520]   I think Steve's wonderful, and I love the guy.
[00:54:42.520 --> 00:54:45.640]   But this kind of declaration of something dying
[00:54:45.640 --> 00:54:46.640]   is usually suspect.
[00:54:46.640 --> 00:54:48.280]   Yeah, no, I'm with you on that.
[00:54:48.280 --> 00:54:52.000]   I guess what he's trying to say to the readers of advertising
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:57.640]   age is how do you change how you think about marketing
[00:54:57.640 --> 00:55:03.480]   and media, too, I guess, given what is a clear trend.
[00:55:03.480 --> 00:55:04.360]   Let me ask you both.
[00:55:04.360 --> 00:55:10.640]   Gina, compared today to a year or two ago,
[00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:12.840]   there was a time when you had to get your email 100%
[00:55:12.840 --> 00:55:14.800]   on your computer.
[00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:17.360]   What percentage of time do you do email checking now
[00:55:17.360 --> 00:55:20.200]   on a mobile device instead of a computer?
[00:55:20.200 --> 00:55:21.360]   Oh, a lot more.
[00:55:21.360 --> 00:55:22.040]   A lot more.
[00:55:22.040 --> 00:55:25.600]   I deal with email in the spaces when I'm standing in line
[00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:28.200]   and in the car way more.
[00:55:28.200 --> 00:55:31.240]   So percentage of time-- I mean, god,
[00:55:31.240 --> 00:55:33.280]   I have to say 60% or 70% of the time
[00:55:33.280 --> 00:55:35.080]   I'm checking email, responding email,
[00:55:35.080 --> 00:55:37.360]   processing email on my mobile device, for sure.
[00:55:37.360 --> 00:55:39.800]   I'm a very heavy email user on Android.
[00:55:39.800 --> 00:55:41.080]   It's the only way I could stay on top of it
[00:55:41.080 --> 00:55:42.760]   is using that kind of extra few minutes
[00:55:42.760 --> 00:55:46.520]   I have standing in line somewhere, for sure.
[00:55:46.520 --> 00:55:48.800]   I check, but I don't write.
[00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:49.640]   Yeah, I'm the same way.
[00:55:49.640 --> 00:55:53.080]   So I'll check it and delete it or maybe process it.
[00:55:53.080 --> 00:55:55.240]   But it's hard to write on these things.
[00:55:55.240 --> 00:55:57.000]   So I don't respond a lot.
[00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:57.720]   Write me some terrible--
[00:55:57.720 --> 00:55:58.720]   Write me some terrible--
[00:55:58.720 --> 00:55:59.440]   Yeah, one liners.
[00:55:59.440 --> 00:56:02.680]   And in fact, I think this is hurting my email because I kind
[00:56:02.680 --> 00:56:04.200]   of now feel like, well, I've looked at it,
[00:56:04.200 --> 00:56:05.400]   but I haven't really looked at it.
[00:56:05.400 --> 00:56:05.800]   It goes.
[00:56:05.800 --> 00:56:07.160]   Yeah.
[00:56:07.160 --> 00:56:07.840]   So in a way--
[00:56:07.840 --> 00:56:09.960]   It's a three weeks later, somebody says, hello.
[00:56:09.960 --> 00:56:10.480]   What do you think?
[00:56:10.480 --> 00:56:12.040]   You say, I saw it.
[00:56:12.040 --> 00:56:13.800]   I meant to respond, but I wasn't--
[00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:14.600]   I was in a process.
[00:56:14.600 --> 00:56:15.640]   Actually, I thought it was so important.
[00:56:15.640 --> 00:56:17.520]   I looked at it on my mobile device.
[00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:19.120]   I didn't do anything.
[00:56:19.120 --> 00:56:21.240]   You need a good email productivity system, Leo.
[00:56:21.240 --> 00:56:22.240]   We should talk about that.
[00:56:22.240 --> 00:56:23.400]   Do you have one?
[00:56:23.400 --> 00:56:24.680]   I mean, yeah, I definitely do.
[00:56:24.680 --> 00:56:28.000]   I have a follow-up folder that I label stuff follow-up.
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:29.680]   And when I get back to my computer
[00:56:29.680 --> 00:56:32.560]   and I have the full screen and stuff, I go to it.
[00:56:32.560 --> 00:56:34.000]   I'm all kind of a nerd.
[00:56:34.000 --> 00:56:37.760]   I've wanted to do a show with you and Merlin just on this,
[00:56:37.760 --> 00:56:38.760]   on productivity.
[00:56:38.760 --> 00:56:41.200]   But it's just like, please help me.
[00:56:41.200 --> 00:56:43.400]   But I'm also kind of thinking that I don't think
[00:56:43.400 --> 00:56:44.440]   there's any solution to this.
[00:56:44.440 --> 00:56:44.960]   So maybe--
[00:56:44.960 --> 00:56:45.560]   I don't think so.
[00:56:45.560 --> 00:56:46.760]   I have to go through the first time.
[00:56:46.760 --> 00:56:47.260]   Yeah, I do.
[00:56:47.260 --> 00:56:49.440]   I put-- is this going to show here?
[00:56:49.440 --> 00:56:50.440]   What is it?
[00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:51.440]   I put--
[00:56:51.440 --> 00:56:53.400]   It looks like you're stomach.
[00:56:53.400 --> 00:56:55.920]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:56:55.920 --> 00:56:57.480]   No, now it's your crotch.
[00:56:57.480 --> 00:56:59.640]   OK.
[00:56:59.640 --> 00:57:01.040]   We're talking about that too much.
[00:57:01.040 --> 00:57:05.520]   I put post-it notes on the laptop.
[00:57:05.520 --> 00:57:08.200]   Well, I go back and I can write down old notes there.
[00:57:08.200 --> 00:57:08.680]   It doesn't work.
[00:57:08.680 --> 00:57:09.560]   I have notes here.
[00:57:09.560 --> 00:57:10.760]   Post-it notes.
[00:57:10.760 --> 00:57:13.280]   You are so retro.
[00:57:13.280 --> 00:57:14.200]   Post-it notes.
[00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:15.960]   I'm one of these in Bug Zero freaks.
[00:57:15.960 --> 00:57:16.480]   Are you--
[00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:18.480]   Are you still on?
[00:57:18.480 --> 00:57:20.920]   Yeah, I empty my-- so when I'm looking at my email,
[00:57:20.920 --> 00:57:22.440]   kind of on the go, I empty it out.
[00:57:22.440 --> 00:57:24.200]   Put the stuff I need to do something about and follow up
[00:57:24.200 --> 00:57:25.200]   archive delete around.
[00:57:25.200 --> 00:57:27.120]   I've been here since you've had an empty email, Alex Cleo.
[00:57:27.120 --> 00:57:28.960]   Never.
[00:57:28.960 --> 00:57:29.840]   Never.
[00:57:29.840 --> 00:57:32.240]   I'm super anal freak though.
[00:57:32.240 --> 00:57:33.960]   So I'm not a good--
[00:57:33.960 --> 00:57:34.600]   I'm not a good--
[00:57:34.600 --> 00:57:36.600]   You know, what you have to do is hypnotize both of us.
[00:57:36.600 --> 00:57:38.920]   That's only thing that's going to change us.
[00:57:38.920 --> 00:57:40.480]   Oh, you know, I only have-- let me see.
[00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:42.520]   I'll just check on my inbox right now.
[00:57:42.520 --> 00:57:50.040]   Looks like I have 52,98 messages, 6,905 on red.
[00:57:50.040 --> 00:57:51.040]   So I'm kind of screwed.
[00:57:51.040 --> 00:57:51.520]   That hurts me.
[00:57:51.520 --> 00:57:54.440]   How could I get to zero from that, Gina?
[00:57:54.440 --> 00:57:56.040]   Select all archive.
[00:57:56.040 --> 00:57:58.240]   Delete.
[00:57:58.240 --> 00:57:58.760]   Wait a minute.
[00:57:58.760 --> 00:57:59.560]   But look carefully.
[00:57:59.560 --> 00:58:01.600]   I think there's something from Gina Tarpani in there.
[00:58:01.600 --> 00:58:02.160]   There is.
[00:58:02.160 --> 00:58:02.600]   There is.
[00:58:02.600 --> 00:58:03.600]   I see my name in there.
[00:58:03.600 --> 00:58:06.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:58:06.560 --> 00:58:07.800]   Oh, I don't know.
[00:58:07.800 --> 00:58:10.200]   Of course, GVL changed our habits there.
[00:58:10.200 --> 00:58:11.880]   Because we kept everything now.
[00:58:11.880 --> 00:58:12.600]   Yeah.
[00:58:12.600 --> 00:58:15.600]   Which is good, which I like.
[00:58:15.600 --> 00:58:18.920]   But it means there's no such thing as an empty mailbox.
[00:58:18.920 --> 00:58:21.520]   For us, normal people, Gina.
[00:58:21.520 --> 00:58:23.560]   I just-- I have to differentiate between the stuff
[00:58:23.560 --> 00:58:25.560]   that I have to do something about and the stuff that I don't.
[00:58:25.560 --> 00:58:28.240]   And that's the key differentiator for me.
[00:58:28.240 --> 00:58:28.920]   Yeah, I just-- wait.
[00:58:28.920 --> 00:58:29.760]   I have Leo's rule.
[00:58:29.760 --> 00:58:32.200]   I wait till they come back to me three times.
[00:58:32.200 --> 00:58:32.640]   Yeah.
[00:58:32.640 --> 00:58:34.560]   Well, I mean, that's definitely one way to do it.
[00:58:34.560 --> 00:58:36.400]   You can certainly trust that the important stuff
[00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:38.200]   will bubble up again, for sure.
[00:58:38.200 --> 00:58:39.600]   No, I mean, that works.
[00:58:39.600 --> 00:58:40.600]   Am I annoying the piece?
[00:58:40.600 --> 00:58:41.120]   It's the key.
[00:58:41.120 --> 00:58:41.600]   It's the key.
[00:58:41.600 --> 00:58:42.600]   It's the key.
[00:58:42.600 --> 00:58:44.600]   It's the key.
[00:58:44.600 --> 00:58:49.000]   To quote Dave Allen, I do not have a mind like water.
[00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:50.040]   You have a mind like--
[00:58:50.040 --> 00:58:51.040]   I don't know.
[00:58:51.040 --> 00:58:54.600]   I don't know what, like a turbulent pool.
[00:58:54.600 --> 00:58:57.040]   I would-- but I'm very interested in how to solve this.
[00:58:57.040 --> 00:58:58.480]   You know what I recently took off?
[00:58:58.480 --> 00:59:02.000]   I had an autoresponder on there, which would basically say,
[00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:04.600]   hey, I got your mail, but don't expect anything.
[00:59:04.600 --> 00:59:06.080]   And I mean, it was more elaborate.
[00:59:06.080 --> 00:59:07.360]   But that was the gist of it.
[00:59:07.360 --> 00:59:10.320]   And I took that off because then people--
[00:59:10.320 --> 00:59:12.280]   I know we're saying, well, I keep getting this responder.
[00:59:12.280 --> 00:59:13.440]   Are you seeing your mail?
[00:59:13.440 --> 00:59:14.920]   It's like, well, yes, can't you read?
[00:59:14.920 --> 00:59:16.600]   It says, I got your mail.
[00:59:16.600 --> 00:59:17.560]   I get a lot of mail.
[00:59:17.560 --> 00:59:19.480]   I'll read it, but I may not respond to you.
[00:59:19.480 --> 00:59:20.480]   But they don't get that.
[00:59:20.480 --> 00:59:22.400]   They'd say, it was automatic.
[00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:23.280]   So now I just turn it off.
[00:59:23.280 --> 00:59:24.040]   I said, screw you.
[00:59:24.040 --> 00:59:24.840]   It's an empty hole.
[00:59:24.840 --> 00:59:27.200]   Just send the black hole of Leo's email.
[00:59:27.200 --> 00:59:28.160]   Just send it.
[00:59:28.160 --> 00:59:29.480]   Maybe I'll get back to you.
[00:59:29.480 --> 00:59:30.120]   I don't know.
[00:59:30.120 --> 00:59:31.640]   I don't know what to do.
[00:59:31.640 --> 00:59:33.040]   I've declared email backups.
[00:59:33.040 --> 00:59:34.400]   You know, I've declared life backups.
[00:59:34.400 --> 00:59:35.960]   Do I have an obligation?
[00:59:35.960 --> 00:59:39.200]   Just because somebody emailed me, do I have an obligation to them?
[00:59:39.200 --> 00:59:40.280]   No, you do not.
[00:59:40.280 --> 00:59:42.400]   Otherwise, I'm opening myself up to the world.
[00:59:42.400 --> 00:59:44.200]   And I have obligations to many people.
[00:59:44.200 --> 00:59:46.640]   I had a guy yesterday who yelled at me.
[00:59:46.640 --> 00:59:48.920]   He got blessed in there, a discussion about my book.
[00:59:48.920 --> 00:59:49.840]   And they wrote this little thing.
[00:59:49.840 --> 00:59:50.880]   And I wrote back to me.
[00:59:50.880 --> 00:59:52.080]   I said, thank you very much.
[00:59:52.080 --> 00:59:54.040]   I don't think that was of interest, which I actually did.
[00:59:54.040 --> 00:59:55.120]   He started yelling at me.
[00:59:55.120 --> 00:59:57.600]   We only spent three seconds on this.
[00:59:57.600 --> 00:59:58.520]   And I just went after him.
[00:59:58.520 --> 01:00:00.920]   I said, you know, I got a lot of things in life, man.
[01:00:00.920 --> 01:00:01.800]   I got kids.
[01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:02.400]   Totally.
[01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:03.400]   And let me just be clear.
[01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:05.200]   Just because I have an empty inbox does not mean that I
[01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:06.120]   reply to everyone.
[01:00:06.120 --> 01:00:07.680]   I mean, I'm pretty ruthless about--
[01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:09.520]   there's a lot of people I don't reply to.
[01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:10.400]   So what do you do?
[01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:10.800]   You just delete.
[01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:13.480]   The person who's offering me money for a job that I want to do.
[01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:16.240]   You know, I want to get back to them or whatever.
[01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:19.240]   I just-- because someone emails you doesn't mean you.
[01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:19.760]   No, no.
[01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:22.360]   And the truth is, I don't have a problem to leave an email.
[01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:25.680]   My problem is I get a lot of email that is people offering me
[01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:26.280]   money.
[01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:28.840]   So I can't even respond to that.
[01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:31.560]   It's like I get a lot of email that I would--
[01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:34.520]   you know, in a normal world I would respond to.
[01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:38.160]   But we have created so many inputs for ourselves.
[01:00:38.160 --> 01:00:41.760]   And so many ways that people can get their hands into our minds.
[01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:43.080]   I don't know what to do.
[01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:47.360]   Well, we don't have new social norms established yet.
[01:00:47.360 --> 01:00:49.320]   That's, I think, the bigger problem here.
[01:00:49.320 --> 01:00:50.280]   Sorry, I just went out.
[01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:52.840]   I'm dead.
[01:00:52.840 --> 01:00:58.720]   Back to life, we don't have norms that handle this stuff yet.
[01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:01.760]   And say, no, I vile-- I assaulted the hell out of that man
[01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:02.920]   by that responding to him.
[01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:05.080]   I was giving him equal time to what he gave me.
[01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:06.880]   Sorry, I can't do that.
[01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:07.880]   It happened all the time.
[01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:08.840]   There's a lot of structure to say that.
[01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:10.200]   Right.
[01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:11.400]   Happens all the time.
[01:01:11.400 --> 01:01:13.680]   That's why I like sometimes doing that one line reply
[01:01:13.680 --> 01:01:16.680]   from your phone, because it kind of gives you
[01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:18.080]   a little bit of an out, you know.
[01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:19.080]   What is it?
[01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:19.280]   What is it?
[01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:21.000]   What is the program responses from your phone?
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:22.720]   Yeah, what do you say?
[01:01:22.720 --> 01:01:25.320]   Unfortunately, Gmail doesn't do canned responses
[01:01:25.320 --> 01:01:26.240]   in the Android app.
[01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:27.640]   And that's actually one of the things that I really
[01:01:27.640 --> 01:01:29.040]   wish it that I did have.
[01:01:29.040 --> 01:01:30.760]   So I use Gmail's canned responses on the desktop.
[01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:32.400]   So if there's something that needs a canned response,
[01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:33.240]   I'll put it and follow up.
[01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:35.040]   And then when I'm back on my computer, I'll do that.
[01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:37.640]   So sometimes I am handling stuff more than I need to.
[01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:39.920]   But I'm saying, if somebody sends me a long email
[01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:41.640]   and I just have one line thing to say,
[01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:43.480]   it's almost good if you do it on your phone
[01:01:43.480 --> 01:01:45.160]   and you have that set on my mobile,
[01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:47.760]   because it's kind of this socially acceptable way
[01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:49.320]   to be brief without being in a whole way.
[01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:50.880]   I do put that in my signature now.
[01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:52.880]   It says, for some of my iPads, for my iPhone,
[01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:54.640]   so for my Nexus one.
[01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:55.280]   So they understand--
[01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:57.200]   And now you can put a rich text signature.
[01:01:57.200 --> 01:01:58.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:00.360]   Yes, yes you can.
[01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:02.080]   Oh boy, maybe you just tip so I don't want to say anything.
[01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:03.560]   I'm sorry.
[01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:04.800]   That was my tip, but that's OK.
[01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:05.360]   All right, never mind.
[01:02:05.360 --> 01:02:07.280]   No, we're not coming up.
[01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:07.800]   I mean, no.
[01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:14.840]   So Google has responded to the Street View frica.
[01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:16.720]   Having spoken to the relevant regulators,
[01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:19.360]   we've decided to start Street View driving
[01:02:19.360 --> 01:02:22.720]   in Ireland, Norway, South Africa, and Sweden, once again,
[01:02:22.720 --> 01:02:23.280]   knows Germany.
[01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:25.000]   I'm grandma, they're coming.
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:26.840]   Germany's not on this list.
[01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:29.040]   We expect to add more countries in time.
[01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:29.680]   Here's the deal.
[01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:34.640]   Our cars will no longer collect any Wi-Fi information at all.
[01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:36.720]   But we'll continue to collect photos in 3D imagery.
[01:02:36.720 --> 01:02:42.800]   We recognize serious mistakes were made.
[01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:44.320]   It took a line from the White House.
[01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:47.920]   Serious mistakes were made in the collection of Wi-Fi payload data.
[01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:48.400]   And we have worked--
[01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:50.320]   They stop looting the world with oil.
[01:02:50.320 --> 01:02:53.640]   Yeah, could be worse.
[01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:55.520]   And we worked so quickly to rectify them.
[01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:57.440]   However, we also believe Street View is a great product
[01:02:57.440 --> 01:02:59.480]   for users, whether people want to find a hotel,
[01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:01.000]   check out a blah, blah, blah.
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:07.760]   So basically, they're saying that both the hardware and software
[01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:10.240]   will have been removed to do this from all Street View
[01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:11.800]   vehicles before they resume driving,
[01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:14.600]   but they are going to resume driving.
[01:03:14.600 --> 01:03:16.640]   I wonder if they're taking away the phones and people
[01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:19.840]   so that they can't have their own Wi-Fi on.
[01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:20.920]   You know, well, I bet they're going
[01:03:20.920 --> 01:03:22.880]   to sanitize the hell out of it, right?
[01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:23.400]   I'm out there.
[01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:25.520]   I found my shock yesterday.
[01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:28.440]   Street View came to one block away from me,
[01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:31.480]   and I live way out in the boonies.
[01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:32.920]   I don't want to see the Street View car,
[01:03:32.920 --> 01:03:34.920]   because I want to moon them or something.
[01:03:34.920 --> 01:03:36.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:03:36.880 --> 01:03:39.760]   I mean, I figure people now kind of know
[01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:42.920]   that that's what's going on when they see that wacky vehicle go by.
[01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:44.480]   It's got to be recognizable now.
[01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:46.520]   I wanted to go down the street at the San Diego Convention
[01:03:46.520 --> 01:03:48.400]   Center on Comic-Con Weekend.
[01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:50.280]   That's what I wanted to get some stories on the map.
[01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:51.360]   That's the next thing.
[01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:53.680]   Start picking good times to do stuff.
[01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:54.180]   Yeah.
[01:03:54.180 --> 01:03:54.720]   You're right here.
[01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:55.640]   You are right.
[01:03:55.640 --> 01:03:59.720]   That's like getting the great moments from the sky.
[01:03:59.720 --> 01:04:02.400]   You want to propose great moments to do Street View.
[01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:03.160]   Yeah, definitely.
[01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:05.800]   You know, the Google-- the airplanes
[01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:09.280]   flew over O'Reilly's campus in Sebastopol
[01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:11.640]   when food camp was going on a few years back.
[01:04:11.640 --> 01:04:14.240]   I want to say it was like food 6, 0, 7.
[01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:16.360]   So yeah, so if you zoom into the O'Reilly campus
[01:04:16.360 --> 01:04:18.360]   on the Google Maps, I think it's still there.
[01:04:18.360 --> 01:04:20.640]   You'll see their yard is full of tents.
[01:04:20.640 --> 01:04:21.800]   Oh, that's great.
[01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:23.640]   Yeah, they had some soccer playing robots.
[01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:26.720]   And people set up some projects and stuff, which is cool.
[01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:27.320]   That's really neat.
[01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:28.760]   When I was at food camp this year,
[01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:32.440]   I met the guy who piloted the Street View shopping cart
[01:04:32.440 --> 01:04:36.000]   through the museum in Tehran in Iraq.
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:36.560]   Oh, cool.
[01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:39.320]   Yeah, pretty neat, pretty neat stuff.
[01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:41.120]   So we talked last week about Google
[01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:45.560]   buying an airline travel information service.
[01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:47.800]   Facebook has acquired one now.
[01:04:47.800 --> 01:04:48.880]   Next stop.
[01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:51.880]   It's a user-generated traffic.
[01:04:51.880 --> 01:04:55.920]   So this is mainly an acquire, a higher rate of talented--
[01:04:55.920 --> 01:04:59.320]   It's more-- it's a talent acquisition they call it.
[01:04:59.320 --> 01:05:01.720]   Yeah, because if it's user-generated,
[01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:04.120]   you're not really getting much value from the data.
[01:05:04.120 --> 01:05:06.480]   It's a shame, though, because I hate it when this happens.
[01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:09.480]   Like, CDDB getting acquired by Grace Note.
[01:05:09.480 --> 01:05:12.960]   Here's a database that was kind of created out of altruism
[01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:14.840]   and goodwill by individuals.
[01:05:14.840 --> 01:05:16.480]   And then a big company gets it.
[01:05:16.480 --> 01:05:17.800]   Well, there's another way around this.
[01:05:17.800 --> 01:05:21.080]   AOL has-- what the heck's the name of their mapping servers?
[01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:22.120]   I can't even remember it.
[01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:24.280]   We used to all mapquest.
[01:05:24.280 --> 01:05:27.200]   And so mapquest is switching to using the OpenMap platform.
[01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:28.000]   Good.
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:29.720]   OpenMap-- what is it called?
[01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:32.600]   OpenMap.
[01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:33.520]   We interviewed them.
[01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:34.560]   It's such a great project.
[01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:35.320]   And it's amazing.
[01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:37.840]   What's kind of great about it is that way they're not buying it.
[01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:39.880]   But they're getting the benefit out of it.
[01:05:39.880 --> 01:05:41.360]   OpenStreetMap.
[01:05:41.360 --> 01:05:42.280]   OpenStreetMap.
[01:05:42.280 --> 01:05:43.560]   Fantastic project.
[01:05:43.560 --> 01:05:45.520]   It's basically a wiki for mapping.
[01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:48.880]   And because so many people have GPS's now,
[01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:50.120]   I mean, I looked at my neighborhood.
[01:05:50.120 --> 01:05:51.560]   It's better than Google Maps.
[01:05:51.560 --> 01:05:52.800]   It's very detailed.
[01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:54.040]   They've got elevations.
[01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:56.800]   If you take the wiki, cultural view of the world,
[01:05:56.800 --> 01:05:59.600]   maybe you could even have more local data than Google Maps.
[01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:00.440]   Precisely.
[01:06:00.440 --> 01:06:03.280]   And they do things like hiking and biking trails
[01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:06.400]   that are hard to get a Google Street View van down.
[01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:06.880]   They say--
[01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:07.520]   How do you surf less?
[01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:08.080]   Yeah.
[01:06:08.080 --> 01:06:09.080]   Yeah.
[01:06:09.080 --> 01:06:09.280]   Yeah.
[01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:11.080]   Not in my house, but somewhere.
[01:06:11.080 --> 01:06:13.160]   September 1st--
[01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:15.440]   I'm in a big deficit right now.
[01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:16.280]   Cognitive--
[01:06:16.280 --> 01:06:17.200]   Cognitive is best.
[01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:18.200]   That's going to be my book.
[01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:18.920]   That's going to be your--
[01:06:18.920 --> 01:06:20.360]   You need to buy some foundation for somewhere.
[01:06:20.360 --> 01:06:22.520]   It's going to be a very short book.
[01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:23.000]   Huh?
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:24.000]   Well--
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:27.640]   I'd write a book, but I have cognitive deficit.
[01:06:27.640 --> 01:06:29.200]   I'll let you know when I've got a surplus.
[01:06:29.200 --> 01:06:31.480]   Starting September 1st, next up we'll shut down the site.
[01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:33.920]   In the meantime, you'll be able to export your content.
[01:06:33.920 --> 01:06:36.500]   Next up, we'll not share its user's personal information
[01:06:36.500 --> 01:06:37.120]   with Facebook.
[01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:40.000]   They didn't-- you know, they'll protect you in that case.
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:40.760]   That's good news.
[01:06:40.760 --> 01:06:42.920]   Social travel is kind of an opportunity.
[01:06:42.920 --> 01:06:43.920]   Are you tripping it?
[01:06:43.920 --> 01:06:45.280]   I love tripping.
[01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:46.280]   So I'm going to add you my network.
[01:06:46.280 --> 01:06:46.780]   Awesome.
[01:06:46.780 --> 01:06:47.280]   Yeah.
[01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:48.480]   It's fantastic.
[01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:50.120]   It's so great.
[01:06:50.120 --> 01:06:52.360]   So for those who don't know, Trippit is a site,
[01:06:52.360 --> 01:06:52.960]   trippit.com.
[01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:56.520]   In fact, another guy I met at the founder at Food Camp.
[01:06:56.520 --> 01:06:57.640]   I had fun at Food Camp.
[01:06:57.640 --> 01:06:58.360]   Oh, you sure did?
[01:06:58.360 --> 01:06:59.440]   Why did I meet some great people?
[01:06:59.440 --> 01:07:02.480]   Anyway, I met the founder, and I said, I love Trippit.
[01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:03.640]   I made kind of a fool myself.
[01:07:03.640 --> 01:07:06.360]   He said, well, you kind of made my reputation
[01:07:06.360 --> 01:07:09.080]   with my little kid, my son, because I was talking about Trippit
[01:07:09.080 --> 01:07:11.680]   on the radio, and they happen to be in the car.
[01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:14.680]   And he said, Danny, they're talking about your company.
[01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:16.520]   And it gave us a credit.
[01:07:16.520 --> 01:07:17.040]   Yeah.
[01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:17.840]   So I feel good.
[01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:19.640]   Validated his career to his son.
[01:07:19.640 --> 01:07:20.320]   I love that.
[01:07:20.320 --> 01:07:21.840]   Yeah, to his little kid anyway.
[01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:22.840]   Yeah.
[01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:26.040]   It's like bows of the clown saying, hey, kids, trippit.
[01:07:26.040 --> 01:07:29.520]   So Trippit is a website free, but I'm a premium member.
[01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:30.640]   I'm sure you are too, Gina.
[01:07:30.640 --> 01:07:34.120]   And you go to this site, actually set up an account.
[01:07:34.120 --> 01:07:36.000]   And then whenever you get travel confirmations,
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.680]   you email plans@trippit.com.
[01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:39.800]   And it--
[01:07:39.800 --> 01:07:41.960]   choose on them and builds an itinerary.
[01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:44.000]   Yeah, you just forward your confirmation
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:45.840]   from your airline or your hotel.
[01:07:45.840 --> 01:07:47.360]   And then it just builds an itinerary.
[01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:50.360]   And it tells you how many miles you've logged in a year.
[01:07:50.360 --> 01:07:51.640]   Like, I love the stats.
[01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:53.720]   It tells you if your friends are going to be in the city
[01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:56.840]   at the same time, it's for road warriors, for sure.
[01:07:56.840 --> 01:07:59.720]   I really didn't see the true value until I had six or seven
[01:07:59.720 --> 01:08:01.000]   months where I had a lot of trips.
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:02.720]   And it was fantastic.
[01:08:02.720 --> 01:08:03.080]   I used it all time.
[01:08:03.080 --> 01:08:06.080]   I wish it had existed when I was more of a road warrior.
[01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:07.320]   I kind of really used it.
[01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:09.200]   And of course, there's interesting here
[01:08:09.200 --> 01:08:11.080]   in that nexus of mobile and web.
[01:08:11.080 --> 01:08:13.680]   There are mobile apps for it, which
[01:08:13.680 --> 01:08:14.180]   are great.
[01:08:14.180 --> 01:08:15.080]   And they were smart.
[01:08:15.080 --> 01:08:16.360]   They exposed an API.
[01:08:16.360 --> 01:08:17.560]   So they're a third party apps.
[01:08:17.560 --> 01:08:21.120]   Although I can't remember his name, the CEO of Trip.
[01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:23.520]   It said, you're going to use our app though, right?
[01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:25.440]   Yeah, the Trip@Android app is great.
[01:08:25.440 --> 01:08:26.560]   It's fantastic.
[01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:27.880]   It's fantastic.
[01:08:27.880 --> 01:08:31.440]   I stopped printing out the address of my hotel
[01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:32.760]   or having a look at my email.
[01:08:32.760 --> 01:08:34.440]   I just launched-- you land at a new city,
[01:08:34.440 --> 01:08:35.640]   and you bring up the Trip@App.
[01:08:35.640 --> 01:08:37.040]   And it's like, here's directions.
[01:08:37.040 --> 01:08:38.600]   I know what to tell the cabie.
[01:08:38.600 --> 01:08:39.720]   It's fantastic.
[01:08:39.720 --> 01:08:42.720]   Yeah, and you can add pictures.
[01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:46.520]   It gives you weather, as you said, maps.
[01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:47.520]   It's really nice.
[01:08:47.520 --> 01:08:49.600]   He told me some new features that are coming.
[01:08:49.600 --> 01:08:52.800]   And I put pictures in as I'm going to places.
[01:08:52.800 --> 01:08:53.640]   Well, yeah.
[01:08:53.640 --> 01:08:54.640]   I mean, it's really--
[01:08:54.640 --> 01:08:55.160]   Yeah, you're right.
[01:08:55.160 --> 01:08:58.080]   It's the one that was one by Nokia.
[01:08:58.080 --> 01:08:59.960]   Was it telinav or Navtech?
[01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:02.480]   No, no, I don't mean that was the Trip@ Similar one.
[01:09:02.480 --> 01:09:03.880]   Oh, something like that.
[01:09:03.880 --> 01:09:06.160]   Yeah.
[01:09:06.160 --> 01:09:07.800]   I wonder if I have old trips on here.
[01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:09.160]   I could show you my Trip to China.
[01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:10.200]   Yeah, past trips.
[01:09:10.200 --> 01:09:14.120]   This is one when I first started using Trip@ for the travel
[01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:15.720]   that I was going to do.
[01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:19.040]   I ended up putting in all these pictures.
[01:09:19.040 --> 01:09:21.680]   As I went to places, I'd put more pictures in of the places
[01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:23.040]   I was going.
[01:09:23.040 --> 01:09:25.080]   And it really was kind of fun because it
[01:09:25.080 --> 01:09:28.920]   was a way to think about the Trip and all the places
[01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:30.040]   we're going to go visit.
[01:09:30.040 --> 01:09:31.640]   And now it's kind of a--
[01:09:31.640 --> 01:09:32.140]   I don't know.
[01:09:32.140 --> 01:09:34.200]   It's just kind of a document I have.
[01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:35.320]   It's kind of neat.
[01:09:35.320 --> 01:09:37.600]   Anyway, how did we get into Trip@.com?
[01:09:37.600 --> 01:09:39.960]   Oh, we were talking about Facebook purchasing
[01:09:39.960 --> 01:09:41.160]   this next stop.
[01:09:41.160 --> 01:09:41.800]   And social travel.
[01:09:41.800 --> 01:09:43.200]   Social travel.
[01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:43.720]   Social travel.
[01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:48.600]   So in that respect, Trip@, you could follow your friends.
[01:09:48.600 --> 01:09:50.720]   And you use that?
[01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:53.160]   Yeah, I have three few friends who travel around.
[01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:55.840]   And so, yeah, I get these Trip@ alerts that say,
[01:09:55.840 --> 01:09:58.680]   so-and-so is in New York this weekend, or you and so-and-so.
[01:09:58.680 --> 01:10:00.840]   We're going to be in San Francisco around the same time.
[01:10:00.840 --> 01:10:02.360]   And it's kind of neat.
[01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:04.040]   And actually, yeah, Anil and I use it
[01:10:04.040 --> 01:10:07.000]   to kind of coordinate our trips for expert labs.
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:11.080]   So I want to add you to my address book.
[01:10:11.080 --> 01:10:12.600]   I just need to add you, I guess.
[01:10:12.600 --> 01:10:13.920]   I'll have to figure that out.
[01:10:13.920 --> 01:10:15.560]   That's cool.
[01:10:15.560 --> 01:10:17.320]   Speaking of Anil, he tweeted that you've
[01:10:17.320 --> 01:10:18.840]   got to change the name of Think Tank.
[01:10:18.840 --> 01:10:19.800]   What's the deal?
[01:10:19.800 --> 01:10:20.400]   We do.
[01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:21.720]   We do.
[01:10:21.720 --> 01:10:23.160]   It's a simple thing.
[01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:24.960]   Another company has software that
[01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:27.600]   does crowdsourcing very similar to what we do.
[01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:30.680]   And they have the name first, and they ask us really nicely
[01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:34.520]   to change ours, to reduce confusing and curcushion
[01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:35.800]   and Google juice and that kind of thing.
[01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:38.200]   So we are on the hunt for a new name.
[01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:40.680]   They were very gracious and gave us some time
[01:10:40.680 --> 01:10:43.240]   to crop a new name and switch over, which is nice.
[01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:45.920]   A lot of times these things are like, here's a lawyer.
[01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:47.040]   You need to do this in three days.
[01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:48.080]   They were super nice.
[01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:49.560]   So yeah, we're on the hunt for a new name.
[01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:50.800]   We're at lots of brainstorming happening.
[01:10:50.800 --> 01:10:52.360]   Any good choices in there?
[01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:56.680]   I don't want to throw any out there.
[01:10:56.680 --> 01:10:58.240]   Because we have to decide an online need.
[01:10:58.240 --> 01:10:59.760]   It's torture.
[01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:01.160]   It's torture.
[01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:02.280]   I hate doing that now.
[01:11:02.280 --> 01:11:03.240]   Let's be honest.
[01:11:03.240 --> 01:11:05.760]   Choosing a name is really hard.
[01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:06.760]   It is.
[01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:07.760]   It is.
[01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:08.760]   It is.
[01:11:08.760 --> 01:11:09.760]   It doesn't matter.
[01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:12.760]   Daylight where I'm a partner, when they come up with a brand,
[01:11:12.760 --> 01:11:14.760]   I thought it sounded like a day spa.
[01:11:14.760 --> 01:11:16.760]   I wanted to get a massage there.
[01:11:16.760 --> 01:11:19.760]   And now it just sounds like what it is.
[01:11:19.760 --> 01:11:21.760]   Yeah, I mean, it's true.
[01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:22.760]   It doesn't matter.
[01:11:22.760 --> 01:11:23.760]   I just don't-- it's so hard.
[01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:27.760]   You don't want to get stuck into that sort of the typical startup.
[01:11:27.760 --> 01:11:31.760]   But you realize in the naming process is how all these companies
[01:11:31.760 --> 01:11:33.760]   come up with what sound like sort of crazy names.
[01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:35.760]   Ultimately, it's the product that matters and not the name.
[01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:37.760]   But you do want to come up with something good, something that has
[01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:38.760]   someone has used before.
[01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:39.760]   So it's a challenge.
[01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:41.760]   It's getting harder and harder.
[01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:42.760]   I have to say.
[01:11:42.760 --> 01:11:43.760]   It is.
[01:11:43.760 --> 01:11:44.760]   Because it's not just a name.
[01:11:44.760 --> 01:11:45.760]   It's not just a trademark.
[01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:46.760]   You have to get a website.
[01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:47.760]   You have to get a this and that.
[01:11:47.760 --> 01:11:48.760]   An email.
[01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:49.760]   I mean, it's gotten much more complicated.
[01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:50.760]   Yeah, it has.
[01:11:50.760 --> 01:11:51.760]   It has.
[01:11:51.760 --> 01:11:52.760]   So we're working on it.
[01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:54.760]   Jeff, it's good we named our kids a few years ago.
[01:11:54.760 --> 01:11:56.760]   Because nowadays, I don't know how you name kids.
[01:11:56.760 --> 01:11:58.760]   Oh, because you want-- you want domains.
[01:11:58.760 --> 01:12:02.760]   I mentioned that in the book that there are families who now check
[01:12:02.760 --> 01:12:04.760]   domains before they give the kid the name.
[01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:05.760]   Families.
[01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:07.760]   I would guess everybody does that.
[01:12:07.760 --> 01:12:08.760]   Oh, boy.
[01:12:08.760 --> 01:12:10.760]   So it was originally Twittelitic.
[01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:13.760]   Yeah, it was originally Twittelitic, which was my idea.
[01:12:13.760 --> 01:12:15.760]   I'm the engineer.
[01:12:15.760 --> 01:12:16.760]   I like Twittelitic.
[01:12:16.760 --> 01:12:19.760]   It was very much a programmer name.
[01:12:19.760 --> 01:12:22.760]   And yeah, we didn't do our due diligence.
[01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:24.760]   We really should have researched a little more.
[01:12:24.760 --> 01:12:25.760]   We were concerned Dave Weiner.
[01:12:25.760 --> 01:12:27.760]   Well, that's what I was going to say.
[01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:28.760]   Yeah, Dave.
[01:12:28.760 --> 01:12:29.760]   We consulted with him.
[01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:30.760]   Yeah.
[01:12:30.760 --> 01:12:32.760]   And he gave us his blessing and said that to his knowledge,
[01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:34.760]   no one else had been using the name.
[01:12:34.760 --> 01:12:35.760]   And so we really appreciated that.
[01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:37.760]   So we thought we were free and clear, but we weren't.
[01:12:37.760 --> 01:12:38.760]   So that's OK.
[01:12:38.760 --> 01:12:42.760]   I'm projects-- I feel like this is a kind of mandatory growing
[01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:47.760]   pain of any project that's got sort of traction, right?
[01:12:47.760 --> 01:12:49.760]   If someone's worried about us using their name,
[01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:50.760]   then we've actually got something.
[01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:52.760]   So I'm trying to look at it that way.
[01:12:52.760 --> 01:12:53.760]   Yeah, there you go.
[01:12:53.760 --> 01:12:54.760]   It's a positive.
[01:12:54.760 --> 01:12:57.760]   I've got a comment, interesting Google-related story.
[01:12:57.760 --> 01:13:02.760]   23andMe, which is that personal genetics analysis service
[01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:06.760]   that Sergey's partner founded.
[01:13:06.760 --> 01:13:08.760]   They did a sale a while back.
[01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:11.760]   It was like $99 to have your genome analyzed.
[01:13:11.760 --> 01:13:15.760]   And so I jumped on it because normally it's like $500 or something.
[01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:16.760]   And I got my results back.
[01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:17.760]   And I need to write this up.
[01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:18.760]   I haven't written up.
[01:13:18.760 --> 01:13:22.760]   And obviously it can potentially contain a lot of sort of
[01:13:22.760 --> 01:13:23.760]   really personal information.
[01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:28.760]   But I am very relieved to find out that I have most likely
[01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:31.760]   brown eyes, which I can confirm.
[01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:37.760]   I genetically tend toward straighter hair than average,
[01:13:37.760 --> 01:13:40.760]   which I can also confirm.
[01:13:40.760 --> 01:13:43.760]   I have-- and this is kind of gross-- wet earwax.
[01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:44.760]   I know you all want to know that.
[01:13:44.760 --> 01:13:45.760]   Oh, yeah.
[01:13:45.760 --> 01:13:46.760]   Yeah.
[01:13:46.760 --> 01:13:47.760]   Wet, very wet.
[01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:48.760]   Dry skin.
[01:13:48.760 --> 01:13:49.760]   So--
[01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:50.760]   [SIGHS]
[01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:52.760]   But here's the weird thing.
[01:13:52.760 --> 01:13:54.760]   She's related to Eric the Red.
[01:13:54.760 --> 01:13:57.760]   So don't they tell you that?
[01:13:57.760 --> 01:13:59.760]   Like where your people came from and stuff like that?
[01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:00.760]   They do.
[01:14:00.760 --> 01:14:01.760]   They do.
[01:14:01.760 --> 01:14:03.760]   You kind of have to fill in all this other information about your parents,
[01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:04.760]   your grandparents.
[01:14:04.760 --> 01:14:05.760]   And I actually haven't gone that far.
[01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:07.760]   I need to dive into the results a little more.
[01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:08.760]   It seems kind of broad.
[01:14:08.760 --> 01:14:12.760]   One of the scarier things was they said, you know, we have all these results for you,
[01:14:12.760 --> 01:14:15.760]   but we've got this one result that you have to unlock to see.
[01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:16.760]   So I click on unlock.
[01:14:16.760 --> 01:14:19.760]   And it says that there's a particular gene that has a very strong correlation
[01:14:19.760 --> 01:14:20.760]   of Parkinson's disease.
[01:14:20.760 --> 01:14:23.760]   And it knows whether or not you have this gene and it wants to let you know.
[01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:28.760]   But like in order to find out, you need to understand that this could be potentially
[01:14:28.760 --> 01:14:31.760]   really scary information and maybe you don't want to know and all this stuff.
[01:14:31.760 --> 01:14:36.760]   So I'm sitting at my computer just like, you know, thinking about Parkinson's disease.
[01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:38.760]   It's a little bit of a scary, scary thing.
[01:14:38.760 --> 01:14:39.760]   Yeah.
[01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:40.760]   I don't have it.
[01:14:40.760 --> 01:14:42.760]   Did you say yes yet?
[01:14:42.760 --> 01:14:43.760]   I did.
[01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:44.760]   I checked.
[01:14:44.760 --> 01:14:45.760]   I'm good.
[01:14:45.760 --> 01:14:46.760]   I'm in the clear.
[01:14:46.760 --> 01:14:49.760]   So they're warning you that you.
[01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:54.760]   That they know whether or not you have this gene, which is kind of has this strong correlation.
[01:14:54.760 --> 01:14:55.760]   And you said, okay.
[01:14:55.760 --> 01:14:56.760]   And then they said, you don't.
[01:14:56.760 --> 01:14:57.760]   Right.
[01:14:57.760 --> 01:14:58.760]   I said, okay.
[01:14:58.760 --> 01:14:59.760]   And they said you don't.
[01:14:59.760 --> 01:15:00.760]   So it was one thing.
[01:15:00.760 --> 01:15:01.760]   Bring it up for.
[01:15:01.760 --> 01:15:02.760]   Yeah.
[01:15:02.760 --> 01:15:04.760]   It was one of these kind of user experiences where I was like, did I need to go through
[01:15:04.760 --> 01:15:06.760]   all that anxiety before I looked at that?
[01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:10.760]   Well, I guess, I guess it's like, you know, call the doctor back.
[01:15:10.760 --> 01:15:11.760]   If I hate that.
[01:15:11.760 --> 01:15:14.760]   If they only told you if you had it, then as soon as they tell you that you should,
[01:15:14.760 --> 01:15:16.760]   you should, you should.
[01:15:16.760 --> 01:15:17.760]   But she doesn't have it.
[01:15:17.760 --> 01:15:18.760]   Right.
[01:15:18.760 --> 01:15:22.120]   So what do they randomly pick a sample of people who don't have it to warn them so that the
[01:15:22.120 --> 01:15:26.200]   people that they're that do have it will know that, well, just because you see this warning
[01:15:26.200 --> 01:15:27.200]   doesn't mean you have it.
[01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:28.200]   I mean, what are they doing?
[01:15:28.200 --> 01:15:29.200]   I don't know.
[01:15:29.200 --> 01:15:30.200]   I don't know what that it was.
[01:15:30.200 --> 01:15:34.000]   Does anybody else done 23 and me?
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:37.440]   Did you get warning that you have Parkinson's?
[01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:38.760]   She got the warning too.
[01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:39.760]   I didn't get that.
[01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:41.160]   Of course I looked two years ago.
[01:15:41.160 --> 01:15:44.360]   Maybe it's new, but I did 23 and me.
[01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:52.160]   Because the new one, everyone who gets that test, the new test gets that information available
[01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:56.560]   to them and they can change whether to see that or not.
[01:15:56.560 --> 01:15:58.600]   So Anna Raven's Crafts is in studio.
[01:15:58.600 --> 01:16:04.440]   They're doctor and ask their doctor about it so that people don't get scared and sue
[01:16:04.440 --> 01:16:08.480]   them about freaking out that, oh my God, you told me.
[01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:12.240]   So everybody who opts for that test is going to get the warning that we don't want to tell
[01:16:12.240 --> 01:16:15.280]   you the result of the test unless you understand the ramification.
[01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:16.360]   Oh, that's fair.
[01:16:16.360 --> 01:16:18.360]   And Alex, do you have Parkinson's disease?
[01:16:18.360 --> 01:16:19.600]   No, he doesn't either.
[01:16:19.600 --> 01:16:20.600]   Okay.
[01:16:20.600 --> 01:16:21.600]   You're okay, Anna?
[01:16:21.600 --> 01:16:22.600]   Yeah.
[01:16:22.600 --> 01:16:23.600]   Yeah.
[01:16:23.600 --> 01:16:24.600]   Okay.
[01:16:24.600 --> 01:16:26.720]   So all three of you got warned but didn't have it.
[01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:29.560]   So don't worry if you get the warning.
[01:16:29.560 --> 01:16:31.440]   I'm adopted and I'm...
[01:16:31.440 --> 01:16:34.600]   So that must be interesting for your adopted because you didn't know anything.
[01:16:34.600 --> 01:16:35.600]   Yeah.
[01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:42.160]   So it was wonderful for me and for my kids to be able to give them some family medical
[01:16:42.160 --> 01:16:43.160]   history.
[01:16:43.160 --> 01:16:46.200]   Ooh, the oars, you're getting your entire genome done?
[01:16:46.200 --> 01:16:48.000]   You know, I never heard back from them.
[01:16:48.000 --> 01:16:49.000]   You're kidding me.
[01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:50.000]   Maybe they don't want it.
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:51.000]   I don't know.
[01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:55.680]   Yeah, I did this whole thing with the George at Harvard and I said I volunteer because
[01:16:55.680 --> 01:16:59.560]   there's only like 20 people and it's expensive and blah, blah, blah and no, nothing.
[01:16:59.560 --> 01:17:01.560]   So maybe I'll just do 23 and me.
[01:17:01.560 --> 01:17:04.680]   Until you know, so I look at it and guess what?
[01:17:04.680 --> 01:17:08.200]   My answer is from Europe.
[01:17:08.200 --> 01:17:09.200]   You're kidding.
[01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:10.200]   Shocking.
[01:17:10.200 --> 01:17:11.200]   I can't...
[01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:14.920]   But the funny thing about this is there's a family picture of my grandmother on my mother's
[01:17:14.920 --> 01:17:18.760]   side and my wife says, "Jeff, she's black.
[01:17:18.760 --> 01:17:19.760]   She's African American."
[01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:20.760]   Oh, that's good.
[01:17:20.760 --> 01:17:21.800]   And it does look like that.
[01:17:21.800 --> 01:17:25.160]   But no, the 23 and me said, "Oh, I like that a lot."
[01:17:25.160 --> 01:17:26.160]   I wouldn't have especially...
[01:17:26.160 --> 01:17:28.000]   Chef, you're about the whitest guy I've ever met.
[01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:29.000]   Exactly.
[01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:32.400]   I mean, there's no bread that's named after me.
[01:17:32.400 --> 01:17:35.800]   Well, I suppose you go far enough back.
[01:17:35.800 --> 01:17:37.560]   We got a little bit of everything in there, right?
[01:17:37.560 --> 01:17:40.920]   I want to like it, but I'm still just as boring as I ever was.
[01:17:40.920 --> 01:17:41.920]   So would you...
[01:17:41.920 --> 01:17:42.920]   I haven't done this.
[01:17:42.920 --> 01:17:43.920]   I would you guys recommend...
[01:17:43.920 --> 01:17:44.920]   Is it a cheek swab, blood?
[01:17:44.920 --> 01:17:45.920]   What do they do?
[01:17:45.920 --> 01:17:46.920]   Spits, bit, more spit.
[01:17:46.920 --> 01:17:47.920]   That's easy.
[01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:48.920]   I got lots of spit.
[01:17:48.920 --> 01:17:51.200]   It's a really bizarre experience.
[01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:53.600]   Can I give them wet earwax instead?
[01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:55.760]   Yes, it's wet or dry earwax, apparently.
[01:17:55.760 --> 01:17:56.760]   You don't have one or the other.
[01:17:56.760 --> 01:18:01.960]   I guess it's like whether or not your ear was attached.
[01:18:01.960 --> 01:18:06.200]   But getting that, the Parkinson's News was a very strange thing to happen in a web browser.
[01:18:06.200 --> 01:18:09.200]   Like I was definitely like, "Oh, this is weird."
[01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:10.680]   Well, now we know.
[01:18:10.680 --> 01:18:11.680]   Well, now we've already cheated.
[01:18:11.680 --> 01:18:13.680]   You call that a user a UI issue.
[01:18:13.680 --> 01:18:15.240]   She's such a programmer.
[01:18:15.240 --> 01:18:18.080]   You scared me half to death, although I'm such a frisbee-ass.
[01:18:18.080 --> 01:18:19.600]   That was the UI of life for them.
[01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:22.240]   I'm feeling like I'm so happy to be alive and healthy.
[01:18:22.240 --> 01:18:24.920]   So I guess that was a good thing.
[01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:25.920]   So this is...
[01:18:25.920 --> 01:18:29.760]   Next ad you see is for a travel around the world, because what the hell I'll celebrate.
[01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:30.760]   Right.
[01:18:30.760 --> 01:18:31.760]   Exactly.
[01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:34.200]   Where do I want to travel in the next seven hours?
[01:18:34.200 --> 01:18:37.680]   You can see all the diseases and traits that they cover.
[01:18:37.680 --> 01:18:39.920]   I mean, it's incredible.
[01:18:39.920 --> 01:18:42.600]   I guess they know the gene markers for all of these things.
[01:18:42.600 --> 01:18:43.600]   Wow.
[01:18:43.600 --> 01:18:49.080]   I think you're saying if I had the old test, then I wouldn't have some of these things.
[01:18:49.080 --> 01:18:53.520]   Yeah, they've added some new things on the new test.
[01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:56.840]   And pull that mic in front of you, because we actually do have a mic that you can speak
[01:18:56.840 --> 01:18:57.840]   into.
[01:18:57.840 --> 01:18:59.720]   You're just a little bit off mic there.
[01:18:59.720 --> 01:19:00.720]   That's my fault.
[01:19:00.720 --> 01:19:01.720]   No, no.
[01:19:01.720 --> 01:19:02.720]   It's my fault.
[01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:03.720]   I should have just done this in the first place.
[01:19:03.720 --> 01:19:10.320]   There is a new test, an upgrade that you can do and you spit in the tube again and
[01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:18.560]   resend it and they will do a lot more gene sequencing to find out new things that they
[01:19:18.560 --> 01:19:19.560]   know.
[01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:24.240]   And they're adding new things all the time based on studies that come out.
[01:19:24.240 --> 01:19:25.240]   So...
[01:19:25.240 --> 01:19:27.240]   Is this the best one, you think?
[01:19:27.240 --> 01:19:29.800]   It's the one that I found really cool.
[01:19:29.800 --> 01:19:32.280]   If all three of you have done it, it must be a good...
[01:19:32.280 --> 01:19:37.780]   Well, the other thing is, I haven't really played with this yet, but it does let you...
[01:19:37.780 --> 01:19:39.560]   People can come to you and say, "We're related.
[01:19:39.560 --> 01:19:40.560]   Do you want to connect?"
[01:19:40.560 --> 01:19:43.840]   Oh, boy, that's scary.
[01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:44.840]   Talk about it.
[01:19:44.840 --> 01:19:45.840]   I already got an email problem.
[01:19:45.840 --> 01:19:47.320]   I don't want to open that can of worms.
[01:19:47.320 --> 01:19:50.000]   Oh, I got a lot of worms in my can.
[01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.000]   That's fine.
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:56.280]   My family's from the Hills, West Virginia, so God knows.
[01:19:56.280 --> 01:19:57.800]   You got a pretty mouth.
[01:19:57.800 --> 01:19:58.800]   I do.
[01:19:58.800 --> 01:20:00.360]   We get a lack of worms.
[01:20:00.360 --> 01:20:04.000]   The cousins like each other a lot.
[01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:05.000]   Let's take a break.
[01:20:05.000 --> 01:20:06.000]   We're going to come back.
[01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:07.000]   Actually, let's not take a break.
[01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:08.000]   I don't have a commercial.
[01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:14.280]   Let's go right into our tip pick and tip number and tool of the week starting with Gina Trapani,
[01:20:14.280 --> 01:20:16.000]   her tip of the week.
[01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:17.800]   Sure.
[01:20:17.800 --> 01:20:19.040]   Jeff mentioned it earlier.
[01:20:19.040 --> 01:20:25.880]   Gmail now offers rich text signatures.
[01:20:25.880 --> 01:20:28.080]   And honestly, I wouldn't have thought this is that big a deal.
[01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:32.720]   I'm a big fan of plain text email, but I build this Firefox extension for Gmail.
[01:20:32.720 --> 01:20:36.520]   This rich text signature is one of my most requested features.
[01:20:36.520 --> 01:20:38.000]   That's what Google said too.
[01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:39.720]   Yeah, it's amazing.
[01:20:39.720 --> 01:20:44.080]   Rich text signature just means you can use HTML to format your name and your contact
[01:20:44.080 --> 01:20:45.080]   information.
[01:20:45.080 --> 01:20:47.200]   You can add a company logo.
[01:20:47.200 --> 01:20:49.280]   Now, this isn't even a labs thing.
[01:20:49.280 --> 01:20:50.720]   This is just in settings.
[01:20:50.720 --> 01:20:56.800]   If you go to Gmail settings, you can create a signature with images and colors and formatted
[01:20:56.800 --> 01:20:57.800]   text.
[01:20:57.800 --> 01:21:02.280]   And you have the option for either plain text or rich text.
[01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:04.840]   I want to make my entire signature in Comic Sans.
[01:21:04.840 --> 01:21:05.840]   What do you think?
[01:21:05.840 --> 01:21:06.840]   Comic Sans, baby.
[01:21:06.840 --> 01:21:07.840]   There you go.
[01:21:07.840 --> 01:21:08.840]   Yeah.
[01:21:08.840 --> 01:21:09.840]   What was the LeBron font?
[01:21:09.840 --> 01:21:10.840]   Yeah, that was it.
[01:21:10.840 --> 01:21:11.840]   That's the LeBron font.
[01:21:11.840 --> 01:21:12.840]   We call that the LeBron.
[01:21:12.840 --> 01:21:15.680]   This is the Cleveland Cavaliers style signature now.
[01:21:15.680 --> 01:21:17.120]   Can you put images in there as well?
[01:21:17.120 --> 01:21:18.360]   I believe you can.
[01:21:18.360 --> 01:21:19.360]   Yeah.
[01:21:19.360 --> 01:21:21.360]   Google shows a Google logo there.
[01:21:21.360 --> 01:21:22.360]   I could get a link.
[01:21:22.360 --> 01:21:24.240]   I could put an email address.
[01:21:24.240 --> 01:21:25.800]   So what do you think about this?
[01:21:25.800 --> 01:21:30.000]   I mean, it's better than HTML, I think, right?
[01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:32.400]   Well, I think it is HTML, ultimately.
[01:21:32.400 --> 01:21:33.400]   Oh, it is.
[01:21:33.400 --> 01:21:34.400]   I think so.
[01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:35.400]   Yeah.
[01:21:35.400 --> 01:21:36.400]   It's kind of a constrained HTML.
[01:21:36.400 --> 01:21:37.400]   You can't.
[01:21:37.400 --> 01:21:38.400]   I'm a nerd.
[01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:39.760]   I'm plain text email all the way.
[01:21:39.760 --> 01:21:45.240]   But I think most normal people like to format their email to look nice.
[01:21:45.240 --> 01:21:46.240]   Right.
[01:21:46.240 --> 01:21:47.720]   And it's about time.
[01:21:47.720 --> 01:21:48.720]   It literally, it's been years.
[01:21:48.720 --> 01:21:49.720]   People have wanted to know.
[01:21:49.720 --> 01:21:52.080]   This is kind of like the big thing that people wanted in Gmail.
[01:21:52.080 --> 01:21:55.240]   Most people took control of their signature or format that signature.
[01:21:55.240 --> 01:21:59.520]   What I saw that you put that in there, what my wish was, was I wish I could put a legal
[01:21:59.520 --> 01:22:00.520]   signature.
[01:22:00.520 --> 01:22:02.520]   I'm driven nothing.
[01:22:02.520 --> 01:22:04.520]   Is there a legal signature?
[01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:08.880]   Well, you know, what I do now is I just put a GIF on the documents because I've got
[01:22:08.880 --> 01:22:09.880]   driven nuts.
[01:22:09.880 --> 01:22:11.040]   I still have a fax machine.
[01:22:11.040 --> 01:22:12.640]   I have a separate phone line for it.
[01:22:12.640 --> 01:22:13.640]   I want to kill it.
[01:22:13.640 --> 01:22:16.800]   And there's just these legal documents that you've got to, you know, every time I do a
[01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:22.200]   speaking engagement, I've got to give them a, you know, a tax form with a legal signature.
[01:22:22.200 --> 01:22:23.440]   And I just get that output.
[01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:25.640]   And it's the only thing that ever affects anymore.
[01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:26.640]   But we make it legal.
[01:22:26.640 --> 01:22:30.040]   No, I see you're talking about an image, a scan signature, an electronic signature.
[01:22:30.040 --> 01:22:31.040]   You mean?
[01:22:31.040 --> 01:22:32.040]   Yeah, one that they would accept.
[01:22:32.040 --> 01:22:33.040]   Yes.
[01:22:33.040 --> 01:22:34.040]   What would make it legal?
[01:22:34.040 --> 01:22:35.040]   I mean, if it's just a scan signature.
[01:22:35.040 --> 01:22:37.520]   Well, then you get into the whole thing we haven't discussed on the show, which is
[01:22:37.520 --> 01:22:42.960]   the White House's effort to create, you know, an identity card, an online identity card.
[01:22:42.960 --> 01:22:44.920]   I suppose at some point that's what it is.
[01:22:44.920 --> 01:22:45.920]   Right.
[01:22:45.920 --> 01:22:50.000]   I verify I am Jeff Jarvis and I say yes to this.
[01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:51.720]   It's probably the only really legit way to do it.
[01:22:51.720 --> 01:22:55.360]   I fake them out now, but just putting on a gift.
[01:22:55.360 --> 01:22:56.360]   Why not?
[01:22:56.360 --> 01:22:57.360]   Just put a gift in there.
[01:22:57.360 --> 01:23:00.040]   Your Twitter verified account isn't good enough.
[01:23:00.040 --> 01:23:05.520]   Hey, that's what I like the Google profiles thing that's, they can get verified there.
[01:23:05.520 --> 01:23:06.520]   We got to get somewhere with that.
[01:23:06.520 --> 01:23:07.520]   All right.
[01:23:07.520 --> 01:23:08.520]   Rich text signatures.
[01:23:08.520 --> 01:23:10.440]   Gina doesn't like them, but use them.
[01:23:10.440 --> 01:23:12.280]   We know you want them.
[01:23:12.280 --> 01:23:13.560]   If you want them, they're there.
[01:23:13.560 --> 01:23:14.560]   What had they degrade gracefully?
[01:23:14.560 --> 01:23:19.080]   I guess they would if I said I only want text emails, I'd probably get the text.
[01:23:19.080 --> 01:23:20.080]   Right?
[01:23:20.080 --> 01:23:21.080]   Yeah, they should.
[01:23:21.080 --> 01:23:22.080]   But that's a good experiment.
[01:23:22.080 --> 01:23:24.560]   I'm going to try and get an experiment and find out.
[01:23:24.560 --> 01:23:25.560]   Can I say, can I tell?
[01:23:25.560 --> 01:23:26.640]   I can think I can tell Gmail.
[01:23:26.640 --> 01:23:28.800]   I don't want anything but plain text.
[01:23:28.800 --> 01:23:33.080]   Well, actually you can compose in either plain text or rich text, but the email that
[01:23:33.080 --> 01:23:39.040]   you receive in the Gmail client anyway displays as it was sent.
[01:23:39.040 --> 01:23:42.240]   I can't turn off HTML or RTF.
[01:23:42.240 --> 01:23:45.720]   Oh, Anna says she knows a way to do it.
[01:23:45.720 --> 01:23:47.520]   There's some magic way to do it.
[01:23:47.520 --> 01:23:49.320]   It'll give you a button, say, show images.
[01:23:49.320 --> 01:23:50.320]   You know, it gives you the options.
[01:23:50.320 --> 01:23:51.320]   Show you the images thing.
[01:23:51.320 --> 01:23:52.320]   Yeah.
[01:23:52.320 --> 01:23:53.320]   Show all pictures.
[01:23:53.320 --> 01:23:54.320]   Only show pictures I've chosen for my contacts.
[01:23:54.320 --> 01:23:56.080]   Oh, that's contact pictures.
[01:23:56.080 --> 01:23:57.240]   Personally, snippets.
[01:23:57.240 --> 01:23:58.240]   All right.
[01:23:58.240 --> 01:24:00.600]   Anyway, I'm sure we'll find out now.
[01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:01.600]   That's one way.
[01:24:01.600 --> 01:24:03.080]   That's one way to find out.
[01:24:03.080 --> 01:24:07.280]   It's just assert the opposite and see what happens.
[01:24:07.280 --> 01:24:09.200]   Jeff, your number of the week, my friend.
[01:24:09.200 --> 01:24:11.840]   Well, I stockpiled them.
[01:24:11.840 --> 01:24:12.840]   Many numbers.
[01:24:12.840 --> 01:24:13.840]   It could have been.
[01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:19.400]   Mobile Facebook hits 150 million users up from only 100 million in April.
[01:24:19.400 --> 01:24:22.000]   I stayed away from that one.
[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:26.640]   Wear a square space spending $38 million in.
[01:24:26.640 --> 01:24:33.560]   By the way, we're very happy about that because square space is one of our signature sponsors.
[01:24:33.560 --> 01:24:37.880]   And I got an email from them last night saying you're going to see this cross the wire.
[01:24:37.880 --> 01:24:38.880]   Big news.
[01:24:38.880 --> 01:24:40.680]   That's a lot of money for a blogging platform.
[01:24:40.680 --> 01:24:43.560]   I think it's really gutsy to come in at this stage.
[01:24:43.560 --> 01:24:45.360]   But it wasn't that.
[01:24:45.360 --> 01:24:49.520]   It could have been that the iPhone 4 recall would cost $1.5 billion, but we're tired talking
[01:24:49.520 --> 01:24:50.520]   about iPhones.
[01:24:50.520 --> 01:24:54.720]   There's no way in the world Apple's going to recall this thing.
[01:24:54.720 --> 01:24:55.720]   No.
[01:24:55.720 --> 01:24:56.720]   No.
[01:24:56.720 --> 01:24:57.720]   I'm waiting for some suits on this.
[01:24:57.720 --> 01:25:00.600]   I think that, you know, I think that's what it was devastating.
[01:25:00.600 --> 01:25:01.800]   Yeah, there already are lawsuits.
[01:25:01.800 --> 01:25:02.800]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:07.120]   So what it is because I want to ask you guys is 4K, which is the YouTube goes to the 4K
[01:25:07.120 --> 01:25:08.640]   video up from the 1080.
[01:25:08.640 --> 01:25:09.640]   Huge.
[01:25:09.640 --> 01:25:11.280]   How does that?
[01:25:11.280 --> 01:25:17.120]   The question I have for you is on my laptop screen or on my TV screen, does that make
[01:25:17.120 --> 01:25:18.360]   a big difference?
[01:25:18.360 --> 01:25:24.520]   Or is that because they said that that properly should be on a 25 foot screen, a projector
[01:25:24.520 --> 01:25:26.040]   the size of a refrigerator.
[01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:27.040]   No, I disagree.
[01:25:27.040 --> 01:25:30.840]   Does it just waste a hell of a lot of bandwidth?
[01:25:30.840 --> 01:25:31.840]   Yes.
[01:25:31.840 --> 01:25:32.840]   That's all.
[01:25:32.840 --> 01:25:38.640]   So 4K is twice the width and twice the height of HD TV.
[01:25:38.640 --> 01:25:45.240]   So it's 4,000 by 2,000.
[01:25:45.240 --> 01:25:46.240]   Let me put it this way.
[01:25:46.240 --> 01:25:47.240]   I've seen a lot of 4K displays.
[01:25:47.240 --> 01:25:48.960]   This is one of the things that I keep saying.
[01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:52.800]   Instead of 3D, it's already been, you know, Hollywood's behind the standard.
[01:25:52.800 --> 01:25:54.160]   There is a standard for it.
[01:25:54.160 --> 01:25:55.200]   There are cameras that can do it.
[01:25:55.200 --> 01:25:56.560]   These red cameras can do it.
[01:25:56.560 --> 01:25:57.960]   I've said it for a long time.
[01:25:57.960 --> 01:25:58.960]   Forget 3D.
[01:25:58.960 --> 01:25:59.960]   Give me 4K.
[01:25:59.960 --> 01:26:00.960]   This is real.
[01:26:00.960 --> 01:26:04.840]   And if you see a beautiful 4K display, it looks like you're looking at a window.
[01:26:04.840 --> 01:26:06.760]   It's very hard to tell it from reality.
[01:26:06.760 --> 01:26:08.320]   It's very effective.
[01:26:08.320 --> 01:26:13.360]   So YouTube is, the story is YouTube is now going to offer 4K videos on YouTube.
[01:26:13.360 --> 01:26:17.960]   The problem is, as you said, first of all, you need a 4,000 by 2,000 display.
[01:26:17.960 --> 01:26:19.280]   Most people don't have.
[01:26:19.280 --> 01:26:20.960]   I guess if you had a 30-inch display.
[01:26:20.960 --> 01:26:24.960]   Well, even on HD, the max is in HD, so there's no way I can see any difference.
[01:26:24.960 --> 01:26:26.200]   On a regular TV, you won't see it.
[01:26:26.200 --> 01:26:27.760]   On a computer display, you might.
[01:26:27.760 --> 01:26:32.600]   There are 2,000 lines of resolution on some computer displays.
[01:26:32.600 --> 01:26:36.760]   But you also need a lot of bandwidth.
[01:26:36.760 --> 01:26:40.920]   You know, they say 4 megabits, but that's to watch it in real time.
[01:26:40.920 --> 01:26:47.640]   That means you need at least 8 to 10 megabits, practically.
[01:26:47.640 --> 01:26:52.080]   Is this a little shot across the bow of the ISPs, just like Google Towns, which they
[01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:53.840]   put up as a website, by the way?
[01:26:53.840 --> 01:26:58.120]   It makes sense that if you're going to do gigabit networking, this would be one of
[01:26:58.120 --> 01:27:00.480]   the applications, hyper-real videos.
[01:27:00.480 --> 01:27:01.480]   Okay.
[01:27:01.480 --> 01:27:02.480]   All right.
[01:27:02.480 --> 01:27:07.760]   So it's our thing to support because a few people can create it.
[01:27:07.760 --> 01:27:09.000]   Fewer still can watch it.
[01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:12.120]   I mean, it takes a lot of something to watch.
[01:27:12.120 --> 01:27:14.120]   I think-
[01:27:14.120 --> 01:27:17.120]   Looking at the playlist, there's a playlist of YouTube videos-
[01:27:17.120 --> 01:27:20.680]   Yeah, we played some of them on MacBreak Weekly.
[01:27:20.680 --> 01:27:22.560]   We talked about this.
[01:27:22.560 --> 01:27:25.000]   And they look, sure, they look high quality.
[01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000]   You can't tell, Gina, because you're not seeing-
[01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:30.800]   Yeah, I mean, it looks like a high quality YouTube video.
[01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:34.520]   Yeah, so- But even if you pause it on a frame, you still get-
[01:27:34.520 --> 01:27:35.520]   There's still some fuzziness.
[01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:36.720]   It's not like it's as good.
[01:27:36.720 --> 01:27:39.120]   A single frame still isn't as good as, say, a still picture.
[01:27:39.120 --> 01:27:41.520]   And you're watching it on the freaking internet.
[01:27:41.520 --> 01:27:42.520]   Right.
[01:27:42.520 --> 01:27:43.520]   Right.
[01:27:43.520 --> 01:27:44.520]   So it looks nice.
[01:27:44.520 --> 01:27:49.040]   I mean, look, the thing that kind of is mind-boggling is that we're even to this stage at this
[01:27:49.040 --> 01:27:50.040]   point that we're seeing.
[01:27:50.040 --> 01:27:51.040]   Yes, that's true.
[01:27:51.040 --> 01:27:54.960]   When, I mean, it was just a couple of years ago that we started doing- Alex Lindsey started
[01:27:54.960 --> 01:27:59.800]   doing 1080p video for the MacBreak podcast.
[01:27:59.800 --> 01:28:01.800]   And we can't- Nobody could watch it.
[01:28:01.800 --> 01:28:05.080]   You know, you couldn't even see it.
[01:28:05.080 --> 01:28:11.720]   So I think what Google's saying is, get ready, high quality videos on the way.
[01:28:11.720 --> 01:28:15.760]   And YouTube, it's interesting because what it's also saying is YouTube- I think this
[01:28:15.760 --> 01:28:21.400]   is the semiotics of it is, hey, we're not just growing shot videos.
[01:28:21.400 --> 01:28:26.440]   You know, we're going to be a place that you will come to watch high quality video.
[01:28:26.440 --> 01:28:31.240]   You know, that's twice in one broadcast that you use the word semiotic.
[01:28:31.240 --> 01:28:33.000]   I just learned that.
[01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:37.000]   If you use in Kuwait, I mean, New York versus true.
[01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:38.000]   Oh boy.
[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:39.000]   A two late.
[01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:40.000]   I already have that.
[01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:41.000]   In fact, God damn it.
[01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:42.000]   I'm sorry.
[01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:43.800]   Gosh darn it, New Yorker.
[01:28:43.800 --> 01:28:47.560]   A PDF of your magazine does not count as an online version.
[01:28:47.560 --> 01:28:49.440]   Would you please get it out here?
[01:28:49.440 --> 01:28:50.960]   This is ridiculous.
[01:28:50.960 --> 01:28:55.000]   If you're a subscriber, you can go online to the website and read the entire magazine.
[01:28:55.000 --> 01:29:00.480]   But it's a freaking PDF.
[01:29:00.480 --> 01:29:02.840]   I just want to get that out there.
[01:29:02.840 --> 01:29:04.840]   He doesn't ask much.
[01:29:04.840 --> 01:29:06.840]   He doesn't ask much at all.
[01:29:06.840 --> 01:29:11.920]   He wants a little bit of technology since 1990.
[01:29:11.920 --> 01:29:13.320]   Yeah, really.
[01:29:13.320 --> 01:29:17.320]   Relatedly, my book is now available as an ePub and a full version.
[01:29:17.320 --> 01:29:18.640]   Yeah, Gina.
[01:29:18.640 --> 01:29:19.640]   I keep waiting.
[01:29:19.640 --> 01:29:20.640]   Not just the PDF.
[01:29:20.640 --> 01:29:21.640]   I keep waiting.
[01:29:21.640 --> 01:29:22.640]   And I know it's aggressive and all that.
[01:29:22.640 --> 01:29:26.760]   If the New Yorker did an iPad app, I would buy it.
[01:29:26.760 --> 01:29:28.240]   Absolutely.
[01:29:28.240 --> 01:29:32.920]   So you may remember that this a couple of months ago, about six months ago, Google
[01:29:32.920 --> 01:29:40.480]   bought Picnic, which is an online kind of JavaScript based photo editing service.
[01:29:40.480 --> 01:29:42.200]   You've probably used it on Flickr.
[01:29:42.200 --> 01:29:48.880]   And they were offering it on, I think, as a paid version.
[01:29:48.880 --> 01:29:54.760]   But now, if you use Picasa Web, you will find an Edit in Picnic button.
[01:29:54.760 --> 01:29:58.320]   And Google has now made it public, which is fantastic.
[01:29:58.320 --> 01:30:02.680]   I think Picasa Web is really kind of underappreciated.
[01:30:02.680 --> 01:30:05.560]   It's not Flickr yet, but it's getting there.
[01:30:05.560 --> 01:30:09.120]   It could really be Flickr in some ways.
[01:30:09.120 --> 01:30:10.120]   Let me see here.
[01:30:10.120 --> 01:30:12.320]   Let's just click on an image.
[01:30:12.320 --> 01:30:14.480]   So this is my tool, obviously, my tool of the week.
[01:30:14.480 --> 01:30:16.280]   There's my teeth.
[01:30:16.280 --> 01:30:21.280]   Now, if I wanted to edit those, press a button.
[01:30:21.280 --> 01:30:22.680]   And there goes Picnic.
[01:30:22.680 --> 01:30:25.520]   This is, I guess, Gina, an HTML5 app, right?
[01:30:25.520 --> 01:30:26.520]   Or is it Flash?
[01:30:26.520 --> 01:30:27.520]   Might be Flash.
[01:30:27.520 --> 01:30:28.520]   Might be Flash.
[01:30:28.520 --> 01:30:29.520]   It might be Flash.
[01:30:29.520 --> 01:30:31.000]   It might be Flash.
[01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:32.000]   Yeah.
[01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:33.000]   You know what?
[01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:34.000]   It must be Flash.
[01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:35.600]   But what happens if you right click on it?
[01:30:35.600 --> 01:30:36.840]   Do you get the Adobe?
[01:30:36.840 --> 01:30:37.840]   Yep.
[01:30:37.840 --> 01:30:38.840]   Yep, that's Flash.
[01:30:38.840 --> 01:30:39.840]   That's Flash.
[01:30:39.840 --> 01:30:41.800]   But you can do a lot of cool things with it.
[01:30:41.800 --> 01:30:43.720]   Rotation, red eye reduction.
[01:30:43.720 --> 01:30:47.960]   It has some nice auto fixing features.
[01:30:47.960 --> 01:30:55.080]   And then there's a premium version, which you can also buy for starting at $2.08 a month,
[01:30:55.080 --> 01:30:59.120]   which is interesting because Picasa is free and Picasa Web's free.
[01:30:59.120 --> 01:31:03.080]   But for some reason, they want to make us a commercial version as well.
[01:31:03.080 --> 01:31:05.440]   Still a lot cheaper than Photoshop.
[01:31:05.440 --> 01:31:07.400]   Which is overloaded with too much functionality.
[01:31:07.400 --> 01:31:08.400]   Yeah.
[01:31:08.400 --> 01:31:09.960]   I think this is for most people what they're going to need.
[01:31:09.960 --> 01:31:13.320]   Red eye, sharpen, exposure, resize crop.
[01:31:13.320 --> 01:31:14.960]   That's kind of the fundamentals.
[01:31:14.960 --> 01:31:20.080]   And then if you buy the premium, you get things like you can print stickers and stuff
[01:31:20.080 --> 01:31:21.080]   like that.
[01:31:21.080 --> 01:31:23.360]   They have more touch up tools.
[01:31:23.360 --> 01:31:27.760]   It's just a matter of time before the functionality of Photoshop and Lightroom and Avature is available
[01:31:27.760 --> 01:31:28.760]   online.
[01:31:28.760 --> 01:31:29.760]   This stuff is getting very close.
[01:31:29.760 --> 01:31:32.040]   And this looks like a Chrome OS play, right?
[01:31:32.040 --> 01:31:35.040]   Because you can edit your image in Picasa on the desktop.
[01:31:35.040 --> 01:31:37.200]   This is kind of an option when Chrome OS comes out.
[01:31:37.200 --> 01:31:38.840]   You'll be able to edit your images.
[01:31:38.840 --> 01:31:39.840]   Exactly.
[01:31:39.840 --> 01:31:40.840]   Yep.
[01:31:40.840 --> 01:31:43.280]   Oh, speaking of Chrome, Gina, since I did this, I think, or similar to this on Lightroom.
[01:31:43.280 --> 01:31:44.280]   Yeah, I think it's a lot of different things.
[01:31:44.280 --> 01:31:45.280]   I think it's a lot of different things.
[01:31:45.280 --> 01:31:46.280]   I think it's a lot of different things.
[01:31:46.280 --> 01:31:47.280]   I think it's a lot of different things.
[01:31:47.280 --> 01:31:48.280]   I think it's a lot of different things.
[01:31:48.280 --> 01:31:49.280]   I think it's a lot of different things.
[01:31:49.280 --> 01:31:50.280]   And I think it's a lot of different things.
[01:31:50.280 --> 01:31:51.280]   But I think it's a lot of different things.
[01:31:51.280 --> 01:31:52.280]   I think it's a lot of different things, but I think it's a lot of different things.
[01:31:52.280 --> 01:31:53.280]   I think it's a lot of different things.
[01:31:53.280 --> 01:31:54.280]   I think it's a lot of different things.
[01:31:54.280 --> 01:31:55.280]   I think it's a lot of different things.
[01:31:55.280 --> 01:31:56.280]   I think it's a lot of different things.
[01:31:56.280 --> 01:31:57.280]   I think it's a lot of different things.
[01:31:57.280 --> 01:31:58.280]   I think it's a lot of different things.
[01:31:58.280 --> 01:31:59.280]   I think it's a lot of different things.
[01:31:59.280 --> 01:32:00.280]   I think it's a lot of different things.
[01:32:00.280 --> 01:32:26.280]   I think it's a lot of different things.
[01:32:26.280 --> 01:32:33.280]   I think it's a lot of different things.
[01:32:33.280 --> 01:32:40.280]   I think it's a lot of different things.
[01:32:40.280 --> 01:32:47.280]   I think it's a lot of different things.
[01:32:47.280 --> 01:32:54.280]   I think it's a lot of different things.
[01:32:54.280 --> 01:33:01.280]   I think it's a lot of different things.
[01:33:01.280 --> 01:33:08.280]   I think it's a lot of different things.
[01:33:08.280 --> 01:33:13.280]   I think it's a lot of different things.
[01:33:13.280 --> 01:33:19.280]   I'll go with two phones.
[01:33:19.280 --> 01:33:26.280]   Tell me if I shut or not.
[01:33:26.280 --> 01:33:35.280]   I'm thinking the Android phone I get, I'm going to get on Verizon.
[01:33:35.280 --> 01:33:42.280]   I'm going to get on Verizon.
[01:33:42.280 --> 01:33:49.280]   I'm going to get on Verizon.
[01:33:49.280 --> 01:33:56.280]   I'm going to get on Verizon.
[01:33:56.280 --> 01:34:03.280]   I'm going to get on Verizon.
[01:34:03.280 --> 01:34:10.280]   I'm going to get on Verizon.
[01:34:10.280 --> 01:34:17.280]   I'm going to get on Verizon.
[01:34:17.280 --> 01:34:24.280]   I'm going to get on Verizon.
[01:34:24.280 --> 01:34:31.280]   I'm going to get on Verizon.
[01:34:31.280 --> 01:34:38.280]   I'm going to get on Verizon.
[01:34:38.280 --> 01:34:45.280]   I'm going to get on Verizon.
[01:34:45.280 --> 01:34:52.280]   I'm going to get on Verizon.
[01:34:52.280 --> 01:34:59.280]   I'm going to get on Verizon.
[01:34:59.280 --> 01:35:09.280]   I'm going to get on Verizon.
[01:35:09.280 --> 01:35:16.280]   I'm going to get on Verizon.
[01:35:16.280 --> 01:35:23.280]   I'm going to get on Verizon.
[01:35:23.280 --> 01:35:28.280]   I'm going to get on Verizon.
[01:35:28.280 --> 01:35:35.280]   As I said, smartaward.org.
[01:35:35.280 --> 01:35:41.280]   We'll invite you all to join us live.
[01:35:41.280 --> 01:35:46.280]   We do this show every Wednesday afternoon, 1pm Pacific, 4pm Eastern.
[01:35:46.280 --> 01:35:53.280]   That's 2000 UTC at live.tv.
[01:35:53.280 --> 01:35:59.280]   You can go to the phone or your Google phone or your iPhone.
[01:35:59.280 --> 01:36:03.280]   Just by going to twitter.tv/twig and there's subscription information there.
[01:36:03.280 --> 01:36:07.280]   By the way, Audible now out for iPhone and Android phone.
[01:36:07.280 --> 01:36:10.280]   And that's pretty cool.
[01:36:10.280 --> 01:36:12.280]   That's pretty cool, I have to say.
[01:36:12.280 --> 01:36:19.280]   We'll see you next week on Twig.
[01:36:19.280 --> 01:36:25.280]   [Music]
