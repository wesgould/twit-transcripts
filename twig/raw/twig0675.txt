[00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:06.980]   get rid of me. I'm here every damn time. Now that Davos is no longer on the agenda. We
[00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:10.740]   can pretty much count on him. He's the Leonard town professor for journalistic innovation
[00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:18.500]   at Craig Newmark graduate school journalism at the city university of New York and always
[00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:24.260]   in a major key. Hello Jeff. Welcome back to fine Fettle boss. I am in actually Petaluma
[00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:32.100]   now but fine Fettle was very nice. Thank you. Was I not here last week? Yeah, you were
[00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:37.600]   in your isolation. Oh, I was in my my booth. My sample and a fall and a fog apparently
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.080]   since you don't remember. I am still in a fog. I might add Lisa is also in a fog. COVID
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.320]   doesn't go away after the symptoms are gone. There's little lingering like that. Why you
[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:52.000]   never delivered the coffee machine to me. I promise you that was good. That's a pro
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:59.880]   it. Put that TV slash H O P. If I could fit it in your Christmas stocking, I will. Let's
[00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:05.780]   just put it that. Got you. Yeah. Ant pro with the man who never says please. Whoa. That
[00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:11.700]   was a good effect. I don't know what happened there. And then I got pun it. We kicked him.
[00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:18.660]   Kicked him out. All right. All right. We Stacy not here. We were we were hoping to have
[00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.260]   another a third person but they got there was a scheduled snake who so it's just the
[00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:30.960]   three of us. I hope you don't mind gentlemen. It just gives us more chance to talk Adam
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:42.360]   Missouri of Instagram to bear poke the bear baby. Which is who's the bear Jeff? Weirdly
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:48.420]   enough and I don't know if it's related Nick Clegg of meta and Adam Mossary of meta's
[00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.220]   Instagram are both moving back to the UK. Actually Adam's not from the UK. Nick Clegg
[00:03:53.220 --> 00:04:03.980]   at least is. Uh, Mossary, of course, is the head of, uh, Instagram, AKA TikTok light.
[00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:14.420]   And talk wannabe TikTok wannabe. Uh, I love the Vanity Fair headline. Uh, Mark Zuckerberg
[00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:25.220]   and Adam Mossary just need you all to stop being big babies. Just knock it off. Uh, in
[00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:30.980]   a recent addresses to both meta employees and Instagram users, the executives got uncharacteristically
[00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:37.620]   unapologetic asking everybody get with the program. That's, that's like remember when
[00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:44.980]   newsfeed was introduced and, and people got mad about it. And Zuckerberg said basically
[00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:51.100]   tough. Other things that he didn't change too fast. He apologized for and shifted. There
[00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.380]   was a whole ad thing he got rid of and all kinds of stuff. But newsfeed, people gave
[00:04:54.380 --> 00:05:00.660]   him a lot of crap for it and he just said in hindsight, he was right. He was right. Right.
[00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:07.580]   Newsfeed was a huge success for Facebook. It was the essence of Facebook. Yeah. Uh,
[00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:12.300]   so Mossary who used to be a Facebook guy and was then, he was in charge of newsfeed. In
[00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:17.220]   fact, that's right. Facebook. Right. So maybe he learned the foot of the master. He was
[00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:21.900]   put in charge of Instagram when Kevin Sistrom had company, the founders left kind of left
[00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:27.540]   in a huff, I think, saying, well, we don't like where you're going with this. Um, you
[00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:33.500]   remember, uh, you may remember from last week, the Kylie Jenner and Kim Kardashian didn't
[00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:38.060]   like what was Instagram was turning into, which is essentially a video. Did you just
[00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:41.700]   didn't matter? Yeah. The people that met while Hey, between them, they have how many
[00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:48.860]   60s million followers are huge. They clearly matter. So yeah, Mossary said, well, maybe
[00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:54.020]   he's maybe they don't matter. He did admit it's not good yet. But he, you know, he, I
[00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:58.780]   think was dodging it because he was actually talking about this AB version of Instagram.
[00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:02.060]   They were testing. It was just, that's always there. Excuse. We're just testing only a few
[00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:07.100]   people have seen it. You're all over reacting. We, you know, it's not ready. But I think
[00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:11.420]   even those of us who are using the plane vanilla Instagram, really noticed that Instagram is
[00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:17.620]   is favoring videos, right? And all videos are now reels. And it's all very obviously,
[00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:22.140]   because of the success of TikTok and Instagram is looking more and more like Pruitt is not
[00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:31.420]   happy about it. And that had an impact. Right. I'm not happy about it. Okay, sure. So
[00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:35.620]   meanwhile, Mossary, besides saying it's not good problem with that. Yeah.
[00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:39.380]   Mossary says, I need to be honest. I do believe that more and more of Instagram is going to
[00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:46.900]   become video over time. So we're like a, when a nurse says, how are we doing? So we're going
[00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:53.540]   to have to lean into that shift, which Vanity Fair says that's tech exec talk for yet.
[00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:59.500]   So I'm going to keep doing me. Sorry to you. It's actually so toxic. You're even mad at
[00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:07.220]   me right now. The thing is all of the videos that are being served up to me from the algorithm
[00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:12.260]   are from people that I don't follow. That's my big problem. It does. And it does look a
[00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:17.860]   lot like the content that's on TikTok. I mean, it's a ton of them. So maybe it is a trend
[00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:22.820]   that they're seeing. So they're figuring out, let's just lean into it. Not that I particularly
[00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:27.380]   care for it. But if they're seeing the data that more people are recording and trying to
[00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:33.980]   post similar TikTok-like stuff, why not just go ahead and leverage it, I guess.
[00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:42.420]   There was an interesting discussion today on Twitter with Siva Vadianathan and Dada Boyd
[00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:45.900]   got into it. Others got into it and tried to find it where Siva said, I think it was
[00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:53.460]   Siva started saying that social networks aren't social anymore. That's gone. And the
[00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:59.300]   interesting thing was that it's not, I disagree to an extent, because everybody uses these
[00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:03.540]   things for different reasons. Well, didn't we read that article last week that said it
[00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:07.580]   socials over? It's the end of social. That was what we talked about last week.
[00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:12.380]   Yeah, your socialist now, your private text messages that you have in your discourse
[00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:20.660]   has become your real social. I'm not, yes, I think that's the business model of these
[00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:29.020]   companies is to have people create media and content and to try to get large audiences
[00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:33.420]   on their own. But I don't think that's how everybody uses them. Some people just talk
[00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:36.980]   to their family or their friends. I watch on my sister, the Reverend Jarvis, talk to
[00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:41.380]   people on Facebook. She's not trying to find an audience of millions. She's talking to
[00:08:41.380 --> 00:08:51.100]   her former parishioners. And that's what she does. So, I mean, of course, they're
[00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:55.300]   absolute right to do whatever they want with the platform. What happens is that people
[00:08:55.300 --> 00:09:02.460]   like you and me and who like still photos are kind of cast aside in favor of the Tik
[00:09:02.460 --> 00:09:07.380]   Tockification of Instagram. And you're right. I see that is what's funny to me is I see
[00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:11.820]   a lot of the people I see on Tik Tock. I see them now. In fact, sometimes even exactly
[00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:20.660]   the same video like this salt hank guy on Instagram. It's like from for many creators.
[00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:24.340]   I mean, I don't blame them. Creators shouldn't care at all. They just put it wherever people
[00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:30.020]   will watch it. So I understand that traction is even now is really promoting shorts. Oh,
[00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:34.740]   yeah. Yeah. Well, and making it so it's easy to turn a video you already have into a short
[00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:39.860]   right is one of the stories. So what Siva said, I misquoted him a little bit. He said he'd
[00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:45.820]   never accepted Tik Tock as social media. He's not sure why others have. It's full of
[00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:54.420]   U C G. It's creators. It's creators. Yeah. And so he says that by mimicking a Tik Tock
[00:09:54.420 --> 00:10:00.540]   meta is giving up on social. I just created this extent about about about Tik Tock. It
[00:10:00.540 --> 00:10:07.860]   is the one platform that does enable collaboration. And that is a social. It's not a social graph,
[00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:11.940]   but there's another piece that makes it social that most people don't see. But my son has
[00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:17.740]   explained this to me. The comments are super important. Somebody said that. Yeah. And and
[00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:24.460]   he gets all of his feedback and tunes all of his videos very successfully. So he's over
[00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:29.820]   two million followers to what he reads from the comments. And so other nasty comments to
[00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:35.860]   or is it is it? He's surprised to be expected more because he's seen my life. And he was
[00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:39.980]   actually very surprised that there were far fewer than he expected. He gets a few ever,
[00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:44.180]   you know, of course, but much better than say YouTube comments, which are kind of notoriously
[00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:49.580]   awful. The Tik Tock comments are very positive. A lot of it is young women offering to marry
[00:10:49.580 --> 00:10:58.220]   him. I wouldn't. Hey, you cook. I think I can't. Who knew if I had only known if I should
[00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:03.820]   have highlighted the cooking. I might have done, you know, I'm actually fine. But you
[00:11:03.820 --> 00:11:08.420]   know, that's what I think it's interesting. Yeah. But he says that's very important. And
[00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:13.100]   that is absolutely social. And also he, I'm not sure all Tik Tockers do this. In fact,
[00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:18.900]   a lot of Tik Tockers don't. But he interacts very much with his comments. He's always responding
[00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:24.260]   to them. Furthermore, and it's not just it's not just the sharing. There's collaboration.
[00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:29.340]   So he's very aware of other cooks on he's a cook on Tik Tok. Other cooks on Tik Tok and
[00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:35.780]   does collabs. It's kind of more like YouTube. So it's it's it's social. But see, then that's
[00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:41.220]   social with creators only. So maybe that's not fully social. But for I would say for Henry,
[00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:47.700]   that Tik Tok is absolutely a social platform. And he's using Instagram much the same way.
[00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:54.980]   Although now that I think about it, his Instagram account used to be much more his personal
[00:11:54.980 --> 00:12:00.980]   Instagram account. Now it's the salt hank. It's marketing. Can I can I make a little
[00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:05.660]   can I be so bold as to make a suggestion to the young man? Yeah, go ahead. I do it all
[00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:09.700]   the time. But it doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. Cause he knows I was going to go just
[00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:13.220]   as I usually do to Tik Tok and for salt hank and get mad that they don't show them to me
[00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:16.580]   often enough. But instead I just googled him and I go to Hank's kitchen, which of course
[00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:21.580]   is where he sells the salt. But there's no links there to his social that I can find.
[00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:26.020]   I don't know what Hank's kitchen is. I don't think that's him. No Hank's not kitchen. It's
[00:12:26.020 --> 00:12:33.700]   his salt. Go look Bob if dead. No, his salt is salt hank.com. Well, if you go to Hank's
[00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:39.580]   not kitchen, really. He's got a redirect sir. Oh, it's not kitchen. Okay. Good for him.
[00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:44.380]   That's good. He's got another. Oh yeah, that's him. Yeah. He has a he doesn't he used to
[00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:48.420]   have a link. Oh, there it is. You just you're so old. You can't see the little tiny Tik Tok
[00:12:48.420 --> 00:13:00.900]   there. You really are a boomer, aren't you? I am. Oh man. I have by the way, man, you've
[00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:05.660]   got to be nice as whole people as with all dads. I am, you know, I go over and I can't
[00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:11.780]   even help myself. I go over and say, well, Henry, you know, you're a good and it's and
[00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:16.420]   then I catch myself doing it. It's like, come on. I'm knocking off. I come from a different
[00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:21.580]   generation, even though it podcasting seems to me be modern and new. It's not anymore.
[00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:25.100]   And he knows what he's doing. He really, I mean, I can't. Oh, he does. Clearly, you
[00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:33.260]   know, so he's doing. So I can't I can't advise him. But I was a little hurt because Lisa
[00:13:33.260 --> 00:13:37.820]   met somebody in town who says, Oh, I love Hank's cooking. She says, what do you mean? She said,
[00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:43.740]   Oh, whenever he cooks something, he brings it over. Oh, he is not once. We're in the same
[00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:49.540]   town. Not once as he brought any of his food over. He promised when he heard I had coffee,
[00:13:49.540 --> 00:13:55.620]   he said, Oh, may I bring you some pizole? Didn't happen. But apparently, hey, forget
[00:13:55.620 --> 00:14:03.860]   to other people. He's feeding other people. Was a young woman. He was. Yeah, you got it.
[00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:11.500]   Very good. Okay. Well, Leo, I know I'm an old guy. You were talking about it not being
[00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:17.460]   as social anymore. It made me think a few minutes ago about the concerns I had with my
[00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:22.340]   family with them being youngsters and access to social media and how dangerous it could
[00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:28.940]   be. What does that mean now with the platforms like Instagram and in?
[00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:34.700]   Well, I think isn't it less dangerous use if like, for instance, discord, and didn't
[00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:39.780]   you say you have a family discord like that they all got a slack or slack? That's right.
[00:14:39.780 --> 00:14:44.700]   Slack. So that's not as dangerous, is it? Because it's only invited people can participate.
[00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:48.420]   All the invites. Yeah. So you could post pictures of the kids. You don't have to worry about
[00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:54.540]   somebody who's macking on them or anything. But at the same time, they're they have half
[00:14:54.540 --> 00:15:00.580]   a brain to know, I can just start my own new instance of slack and sure something and
[00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:06.460]   just lie about my age if I have to. Sure. So I wonder if there's still anything like if
[00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:13.500]   there's anything like that happening and if we're in danger of having some type of scary
[00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:20.500]   stories coming out of it. And have you ever heard of something called a Finsta? Oh, yeah.
[00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:28.740]   Sorry. I'm just I'm just teasing. Yeah. I mean, of course, kids know are better than
[00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:32.780]   we do. And about how to manipulate all this stuff. I told you I've told this story before
[00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:39.540]   when my daughter who's now 30 was on Neopets many at like two decades ago and she was little.
[00:15:39.540 --> 00:15:43.380]   That was a big social network. You created Neopets, right? And she learned about web design
[00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:47.060]   and all sorts of stuff from it. And I said, but you got to I did the dad thing. I got
[00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:51.300]   to be careful to make sure you know you don't tell people at school you go to sit down.
[00:15:51.300 --> 00:16:01.820]   I'm a 33 year old guy from Chicago. They know they're way ahead of us in terms of
[00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:05.020]   how you know, it's point about this is they didn't avoid as long when there's people.
[00:16:05.020 --> 00:16:08.300]   We think that they're revealing everything and they don't care about privacy. No, they
[00:16:08.300 --> 00:16:11.620]   have their systems for privacy that are very sophisticated. Not everybody. And I'm sure
[00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:15.940]   there's some kids who really do need some oversight and some some. You know, right.
[00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:21.020]   And then there's there's there's there's hard hit Jacob who who come who comes to me fairly
[00:16:21.020 --> 00:16:28.140]   regularly because he's wanting to be in fashion in the future. So he's constantly posting,
[00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:34.540]   you know, fashion type content. And it's pretty easy for the bots to spot him. And so he'll
[00:16:34.540 --> 00:16:38.740]   come into come into the office and say, Hey, is this this is okay? You know, these people
[00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:45.580]   want to offer me ABCD. And at one point, I knew it was a fake thing, but I just wanted
[00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:49.660]   to do it use it as a teachable moment and say, Hey, let's just go ahead and follow through
[00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:56.980]   and just let you see what's going on. Dad, that's a good and I never have I never have
[00:16:56.980 --> 00:17:02.740]   the sense to do that. You know, like the the the the patients, I think is the word I'm
[00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:08.140]   looking for to do that. That's a smart. Let him let him try and see let him learn and
[00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:12.340]   under supervision, but let him learn. I think that's smart. Right. Right. We did it together.
[00:17:12.340 --> 00:17:16.620]   You know, but he was able to clearly see the process because I mapped it out. I say they're
[00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:19.340]   probably going to say this. They're probably going to do that and they probably want you
[00:17:19.340 --> 00:17:25.420]   to do. Oh, yeah. And sure enough, check, check, check, close family friend I found out yesterday
[00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:33.340]   got a text message saying from Texas saying, you know, this payment that hasn't cleared
[00:17:33.340 --> 00:17:38.980]   you need to call us and she called and she had a freeze all her account. She fell for
[00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:45.740]   a terrible day. Yeah, close family. And I said, you should call me, but she didn't know
[00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:50.180]   she. I mean, this is the problem. This stuff. It's it is a little dangerous out there. I
[00:17:50.180 --> 00:17:55.420]   think it's more dangerous for people are age Jeff that it's for the. But there was a famous
[00:17:55.420 --> 00:18:00.460]   there's a famous one I think we talked about years and years ago when when Sun Jake was,
[00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:07.340]   I guess, about 19, my parents phone rings with somebody saying I'm your grandson and
[00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:14.780]   I'm in trouble. They won't let me know. Right. And my father was ready to go to very worried.
[00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:19.180]   But you know, didn't call him pop pop, which is what we call him. And these things just
[00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:25.940]   didn't click as as as as playing on the emotions. Well, nowadays, all yeah, the scammers are
[00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:32.860]   out and forth. You've probably seen this. There are more now text scams and phone number
[00:18:32.860 --> 00:18:39.460]   scams than ever before the I think we have one of those as a story, which is the wrong
[00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:46.380]   numbers scam. Let's see that. Okay, so this is interesting. You've probably started getting
[00:18:46.380 --> 00:18:50.420]   messages. I have many on my phone. I can probably just pull one up to say something
[00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:56.500]   like, Hey, Una, I'm not going to be able to make it in this afternoon. I hope you can
[00:18:56.500 --> 00:19:02.180]   get my shift covered. Sorry about the short notice. And you as a nice
[00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:09.900]   being a good citizen. Oh, I feel bad for her employer or for Una. I better text him back
[00:19:09.900 --> 00:19:17.100]   and and say, Oh, no, you got the you got the wrong number. And the FCC has just started
[00:19:17.100 --> 00:19:25.700]   warning about this. These are scams. 2022 is on track to be the first year where more
[00:19:25.700 --> 00:19:32.180]   people have reported scammers contacting them by text than by phone. The FCC says,
[00:19:32.180 --> 00:19:37.220]   nobody answers their phones anymore. All right, text and text work. The FCC says, and
[00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:42.740]   they say this is good news. 90% of consumers do not fall for these scam texts. The bad
[00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:51.560]   news is that means 10% do. That's a that's a lot. This people this story from NBC news.
[00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:58.000]   Odd text from a wrong number is probably a scam. This is the text message that Kevin
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:03.180]   Collier got it. Una, good evening. Tomorrow morning, the contract time of 10 a.m. is shifted
[00:20:03.180 --> 00:20:06.180]   to 3 p.m. for signing. I don't feel well. I need to go to the hospital tomorrow morning
[00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:11.540]   to see the doctor. And of course, Kevin hospital. Oh, throw that in. Yeah, Kevin being a good
[00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:17.100]   citizen said, Oh, sorry, it's the wrong number. The other the person on the other hand, Anna
[00:20:17.100 --> 00:20:23.140]   struck up a conversation. Here's actually the text of it. I'm not Una, but I'm sorry
[00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:33.820]   to hear that. So the texture, the scammer says, I am so apology. I dialed the wrong number
[00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:38.460]   to send the wrong SMS. I hope I did not disturb you. Not a problem. Hope you feel better. Thank
[00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:43.740]   you for your concern. I feel much better after taking the medicine. You're a caring person.
[00:20:43.740 --> 00:20:49.020]   What is your name? And that's the hook. It's Roger. What is yours? Hi, Roger. My name
[00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:53.280]   is Anna. I'm from Taiwan. I live in Manhattan. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. What do
[00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:58.100]   you do for work? I'm in real estate. I work as a fashion consultant for three fashion design
[00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:04.380]   companies. And in my spare time, work, learn about crypto, concert currencies with my uncle.
[00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:11.220]   Oh, there's the hook. And he said it was, it took, you know, a few minutes before she
[00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:16.820]   started to sell him, you know, or investments in crypto. Absolutely brilliant, though. You
[00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:21.660]   got to give him that. Yeah, but it's a lot of work. Geez, you've got to string that along.
[00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:26.580]   Hey, can I make an appointment for my dog at your salon? You might be tempted to say,
[00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:29.940]   Oh, no, you got the wrong number. And just don't, you know, which is fine, but don't
[00:21:29.940 --> 00:21:36.540]   get involved because they will draw you in. I get these all the time. Usually they're not
[00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:43.100]   working that hard. You don't? No, I'm surprised. I don't. I get out of junk, you know, like
[00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:48.860]   a lot of expletive. Oh, really? And stuff like that. Oh, just try. There's there right
[00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:55.860]   up front. I mean, I have a bunch of them to say hello, or which here's one from a 601
[00:21:55.860 --> 00:22:03.420]   area code. What are you doing? Now you know, that's it. And I guess if you were lonely,
[00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:09.140]   especially an older person, lonely, older person, you might respond to that, you know,
[00:22:09.140 --> 00:22:16.460]   but you know, it's funny. I get messages like that on Instagram. Direct messages here.
[00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:23.780]   Yeah, here's one just coming in yesterday. My name is Lisa from L.A. Yeah, I'm a senior
[00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:33.140]   account manager in Bitcoin mining. I've heard of Bitcoin before. I've never heard of Bitcoin.
[00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:40.580]   She's on a lot of those. Yeah, a lot of those. Not not in my SMS, but it's that's why I tell
[00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:46.620]   people don't DM me on social because DMS on social social for me is just a flat out mess.
[00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:56.460]   I'll never see it. I'm I'm pretty good. I get the simple, you know, Angela X 4371006 and
[00:22:56.460 --> 00:23:02.980]   a certain busty picture. Yeah, that just says hi. Yeah. Now, if I get a lot of those two,
[00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:10.820]   yeah, on my web interface, I don't even get that I just get high. So on my web interface,
[00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:15.540]   I report it because I want to be a good citizen to Twitter to try to report it on the mobile
[00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:22.940]   interface. Oh my God. They want you to hire lawyers and start a trial. It's ridiculous.
[00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:29.420]   I'm impressed that you reported. Honestly, in fact, I get this call a lot on the radio
[00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:34.140]   show. So may ask me this weekend. Should I report this? And I said, there's no point
[00:23:34.140 --> 00:23:37.540]   that phone number will never be used again. You can't block that phone number. That phone
[00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:44.020]   number is not real reporting. It does nothing. I do a DM. Yeah, I guess on Twitter, because
[00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:49.540]   you're going to get the account taken down. But that makes sense. Those are always spoofs.
[00:23:49.540 --> 00:23:58.540]   Absolutely. Yeah. The chips act has cleared Congress too bad. Stacy's not here for this
[00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:04.140]   one. Stacy, you need a little dance. You'd be happy about that. 52 billion dollar now
[00:24:04.140 --> 00:24:10.820]   Biden has to sign it still. But everyone is assured that he will 52 billion dollars to
[00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:17.220]   US companies to build their semiconductor fab plants in the US. And how long will that
[00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:23.500]   take? I don't know. Because you know, Intel as an example has been holding off groundbreaking
[00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:28.780]   for their 20 billion dollar fab until this bill is law. They were they're hoping for
[00:24:28.780 --> 00:24:33.140]   the subsidies and they're not going to break ground until they do. That's in Arizona.
[00:24:33.140 --> 00:24:40.340]   TSMC, the Taiwanese semiconductor manufacturing company is also opening fabs in the US that
[00:24:40.340 --> 00:24:46.940]   they may not be pleased by this some of the features of the chips act. One of the features
[00:24:46.940 --> 00:24:54.140]   is you cannot if you take this money invest in fabs in Asia, which if you're the Taiwan
[00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:58.500]   semiconductor manufacturing company probably is a non starter. I don't know. What do you
[00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:03.380]   think we talked about this over the weekend? We had Shoshana Weisman on, you know, her.
[00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:09.060]   She was on the show. Ah, yeah. So she's great. You stolen her for for for a big dinner more
[00:25:09.060 --> 00:25:13.380]   often than we've had her on. No, no, she's been on once on each show. No, it was just
[00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:20.020]   all right. It's fair still. One of you will win. No, we love Shoshana. Partly I like her
[00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:27.060]   because she's conservative. And so it's nice to get a, you know, we're all. We've got the
[00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:34.940]   moderate with that and and the leftist. Hey, commie with Jeff, but I think it's nice to
[00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:44.780]   have some and she does work for the our street, our street of pack. And she said, and I don't
[00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:50.140]   disagree with her that while this makes sense kind of on the face of it, when government
[00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:54.420]   pours billions of dollars into an industry, it's like putting your thumb on the scale.
[00:25:54.420 --> 00:25:59.380]   It kind of changes the economics of the industry. And you know, maybe we didn't do need to do
[00:25:59.380 --> 00:26:03.780]   this to keep competitive because China is certainly doing it for its come, you know, chip
[00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:07.980]   manufacturers. But on the other hand, you know, you look at the subsidies and so many other
[00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:12.660]   businesses, especially farming and agriculture. And you can see how it really does kind of
[00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:21.860]   shift the scales of the economics. So I know, I think it's a good idea. Bernie Sanders criticized
[00:26:21.860 --> 00:26:26.620]   it for serving as a blank check for semiconductor companies that are already profitable. He might
[00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:31.260]   have said that before Intel's quarterly earnings last week, they announced they'd lost nearly
[00:26:31.260 --> 00:26:38.420]   half a billion dollars in the quarter. So profitable, not so much this year anyway.
[00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:41.660]   And the strategic issues. And that's where I think it's important is that is it versus
[00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:48.260]   China, we are too dependent on their on their manufacturing. I agree. Yeah. Right. It also
[00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:53.700]   country has us on a stranglehold. I mean, we couldn't even get cars for the most part,
[00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:59.420]   right? You know, as big as a car is in all of those moving parts. But that one chip is
[00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:07.500]   just totally shut it down. Yep. My uncle works for the dealership as a mechanic, just like
[00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:12.420]   my just like his dad, my grandfather. And you know, for the last year and a half, his
[00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:16.140]   whole story every time I talked to him, it was like, well, there's no cars on the light
[00:27:16.140 --> 00:27:21.580]   because we just can't get them. And when they do get them, it's just a handful of cars that
[00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:27.020]   a dad gum big car dealership in this bizarre to see something like that. Everything is
[00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:32.220]   just a used car. And even that is overvalued now because they're here and they're available
[00:27:32.220 --> 00:27:37.300]   in their hot commodity because people need vehicles, but a new car can't seem to find
[00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:44.340]   those. The bill gives the commerce department $10 billion for states and localities to build
[00:27:44.340 --> 00:27:51.300]   out regional technology hubs, mini Silicon valleys. I don't again, it's not a lot of
[00:27:51.300 --> 00:27:57.140]   money as the the budget, the US budget goes. But is it going to is it? Can you do that?
[00:27:57.140 --> 00:28:00.580]   Can you just say, let's spend a couple hundred million dollars and create the next Raleigh
[00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:05.180]   Durham triangle here in beautiful Paducah, Kentucky? I don't know if you can do that.
[00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:10.140]   I don't know if it works that way. They also and I would agree with this gave the National
[00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:16.260]   Science Foundation billions in additional funding for semiconductor manufacturing research
[00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:21.460]   and workforce development programs. And that I think is probably well spent. But anyway,
[00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:29.700]   big big bill got through. And since I'm the house liberal, you know, stuff is happening
[00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:42.420]   from the Biden administration, which is. Yeah. Yeah. The US is going to stop TSMC and
[00:28:42.420 --> 00:28:49.220]   Intel from adding advanced chip fabs in China, however, as I mentioned. And that's interesting
[00:28:49.220 --> 00:28:56.220]   because I guess I guess when you give somebody billions of dollars, you could probably say
[00:28:56.220 --> 00:29:01.300]   that is the government basically saying, Hey, not on our dime. Yeah. Well, no, no, that's
[00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:07.420]   not the question. The money that they give them will have to be used in the US. But TSMC,
[00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:10.860]   for instance, if they take that money, I think they did won't be able to substantially
[00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:17.100]   upgrade or expand its existing facilities at all. Oh, it is this thing. Okay. Yeah. Which
[00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:21.380]   means I mean, that I think that that means they have to turn the money down because that
[00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:28.300]   is a, you know, that they're the number one chip maker for Apple's iPhones, for instance.
[00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:33.820]   Anyway, we'll see. I guess you could put it differently. You could say we're going to
[00:29:33.820 --> 00:29:37.460]   give you money and we don't want this to go to China. Well, that I think that's a given
[00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:42.460]   like this money is going to be to build a plant in the US fine, but they go farther,
[00:29:42.460 --> 00:29:46.100]   farther in the say, and by the way, if you take this money, you can't spend any of your
[00:29:46.100 --> 00:29:51.020]   money to do anything in China. And I don't, because it's fungible in a way, I guess it
[00:29:51.020 --> 00:29:55.140]   is. Either Intel needs this plant or not. Right. Now that's a good right. And so they're
[00:29:55.140 --> 00:29:57.660]   waiting to get the money before that like, like, well, okay, so let's say the bill doesn't
[00:29:57.660 --> 00:30:02.020]   pass what Intel, you're not going to build a chip. Really? That's a good point. It doesn't
[00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:07.420]   really matter. Actually speaking of this Huawei, we talked a lot of this on Sunday as well.
[00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:13.460]   As you remember, this has kind of been going on since 2018, the Commerce Department at first,
[00:30:13.460 --> 00:30:18.900]   then Congress, and eventually the Trump administration said, Huawei networking gear should not be
[00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:25.740]   used in any facilities in the US and other countries have said the same thing. There
[00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:33.300]   was a kind of a weird story in CNN this week, a CNN exclusive that on the face of it, if
[00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:38.540]   you read the headlines kind of confirms what the Commerce Department and the Trump administration
[00:30:38.540 --> 00:30:45.660]   has said about Huawei CNN exclusive FBI investigation determined Chinese made Huawei equipment could
[00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:52.580]   disrupt US nuclear arsenal communications. That sounds pretty bad, except the word could
[00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:58.100]   is maybe more important in there than anything out of work that word. They're really, they're
[00:30:58.100 --> 00:31:06.100]   really pushing the could because it in fact is more like, well, it's very near these
[00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:12.580]   equipment's being put in very near nuclear installations. See, look, here's a picture
[00:31:12.580 --> 00:31:22.860]   of a missile silo and a cell tower just a third of a mile away. But we cannot confirm
[00:31:22.860 --> 00:31:26.500]   or deny ongoing investigations. We are committed to securing our information and communication
[00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:32.460]   with technology services supply chain. The Commerce Department spokesman said, are we
[00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:41.060]   are we is the is the the missile run like IOT of a cell phone line? It seems to me that
[00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:47.420]   yeah, you're probably not using that cell tower. And if you know, personnel in the missile
[00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:52.180]   silo should probably not be using consumer grade cell phones. I think Stacy's gone this
[00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:59.580]   week consulting for the DoD and missile places to bring doorbells and so this is this is a
[00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:05.060]   lot of smoke with very little fire. Yeah. At the end of the CNN article, they do have
[00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:12.860]   this graph critics see xenophobic overreach. Despite its tough talk, the US government's
[00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:18.300]   refusal to provide evidence to back up its claims that Huawei poses a risk to national
[00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:23.180]   security has led some critics to accuse it of xenophobic overreach. I guess you could
[00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:26.980]   say and I understand this that well, the spy agencies aren't going to tell you what they
[00:32:26.980 --> 00:32:32.420]   know because that would be giving away their sources and methods. On the other hand, you
[00:32:32.420 --> 00:32:37.820]   got to give us some or it's just well, we think they could be problematic.
[00:32:37.820 --> 00:32:44.780]   So, while I says all of our products important to the US have been tested and certified by
[00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:49.460]   the FCC before being deployed there, our equipment only operates in the spectrum allocated by
[00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:56.420]   the FCC for commercial use. It cannot access spectrum allocated to the DoD.
[00:32:56.420 --> 00:33:01.420]   So finger to the wind because you just said we don't know anything so we can't actually
[00:33:01.420 --> 00:33:05.500]   speculate. But hey, what we do in the show is speculate. So I'm going to ask you to speculate.
[00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:11.820]   What's your feeling about Huawei? Is this all a political puppet show or are they in fact
[00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:20.500]   risky? That's a good question. We don't know, do we? There's no question that in the Trump
[00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:26.740]   administration, a lot of it was just anti China, right? Yeah. It's Chinese so don't use it.
[00:33:26.740 --> 00:33:31.940]   And it was really about supporting American companies making the same equipment. But which
[00:33:31.940 --> 00:33:41.020]   is not to say though that this equipment could be dangerous. One of the problems is the FCC
[00:33:41.020 --> 00:33:49.500]   which we thought had allocated billions of dollars to pay back companies who were replacing
[00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:57.140]   Huawei equipment didn't actually allocate that money. So there are a lot of in the CNN
[00:33:57.140 --> 00:34:04.900]   story they talk about a telecom. Let me see. I can find it that has a lot of Huawei equipment.
[00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:18.300]   Let's see. It's a big it's a long article. So the FCC in 2020 Congress approved 1.9 billion
[00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:23.140]   to remove Chinese made Huawei and ZTE cell technology across wide swaths of rural America.
[00:34:23.140 --> 00:34:28.260]   But two years later, none of that equipment has been removed. And rural telecom companies
[00:34:28.260 --> 00:34:34.420]   are still waiting for federal reimbursement money. The FCC received applications to remove
[00:34:34.420 --> 00:34:40.460]   some 24,000 pieces of Chinese made communications equipment. But it's more than $3 billion short
[00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:51.900]   of the money it needs to reimburse eligible companies. So where is this guy? There's this
[00:34:51.900 --> 00:35:04.500]   small telecom of VIAero. VIAero started they had a contract beginning in 2011 with Huawei
[00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:13.460]   to provide upgrades for its 3G towers. A decade later, Huawei tech is installed across its
[00:35:13.460 --> 00:35:24.180]   entire fleet of towers. VIAero towers roughly 1000 over five Western states. So in response
[00:35:24.180 --> 00:35:29.980]   to the Commerce Department, VIAero is pulling it out. But they said, but we're not going
[00:35:29.980 --> 00:35:34.780]   to get VIAero CEO Frank Doreko said it never occurred to him that cameras could be a security
[00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:40.020]   risk. They're cameras, by the way, some of them. There's a lot of misosylos in the area
[00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:43.020]   we cover. There's some military presence. I was never told to remove the equipment or
[00:35:43.020 --> 00:35:51.420]   make any changes. These cameras are basically for monitoring I 25 traffic and weather together
[00:35:51.420 --> 00:35:56.940]   and advanced tornado warnings. But they were also inadvertently capturing the movement of
[00:35:56.940 --> 00:36:03.140]   US military equipment and personnel. So there's some concern that China could be actually tapping
[00:36:03.140 --> 00:36:10.660]   into these cameras and seeing this. So Doreko being a good American has decided to rip
[00:36:10.660 --> 00:36:22.540]   them all out at great cost. And he's not going to get reimbursed. So FCC ordered telecom
[00:36:22.540 --> 00:36:26.300]   companies who received federal subsidies to provide cell services companies like VIAero
[00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:32.740]   must rip and replace their Huawei and ZTE equipment. Doreko said the cost of rip and
[00:36:32.740 --> 00:36:36.500]   replace his astronomical. And then he doesn't expect the reimbursement money to be enough
[00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:41.220]   to pay for the change. He's expecting to receive half the funding he's actually due. But he's
[00:36:41.220 --> 00:36:47.180]   going to remove it anyway. It's difficult. That's a lot of money, but he's a patriot.
[00:36:47.180 --> 00:36:54.180]   And so he's going to do it anyway. It's not going to be easy said Doreko. I'm going to
[00:36:54.180 --> 00:36:58.820]   be up nights worrying about it, but we'll do what we're told to do. But you know what?
[00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:05.180]   But these cameras are public cameras on the internet showing traffic. I'm sure the Chinese
[00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:11.020]   also have very good satellites covering the same area. Yeah. This guy, I feel bad for
[00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:15.940]   this guy. It's unclear. You know, is he he's wants to do the right thing. It's going to
[00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:23.980]   cost him a lot of money. Anyway, interesting story. I'm not I'm no fan of China these days
[00:37:23.980 --> 00:37:29.740]   for no matters of politics and even rights and freedom of expression and all that. I'm reading
[00:37:29.740 --> 00:37:33.820]   a book now which I'm disagreeing with a lot, but I think you might find very interesting.
[00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:38.820]   Have you heard of this one for internets for Internet's Keira Nohera and Wendy Hall. I read
[00:37:38.820 --> 00:37:43.100]   their paper and quoted it in the Gutenberg book and then they came out with the full
[00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:47.460]   book. This was the splinter net paper, right? Yeah, basically, they said that we have the
[00:37:47.460 --> 00:37:55.580]   American the four Internet's are actually five. The one Internet is is the Silicon Valley
[00:37:55.580 --> 00:38:00.380]   full freedoms openness. Then there's what they call the Washington only because the
[00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:03.660]   Supreme Court said this, but they're really mean is the American business Internet, where
[00:38:03.660 --> 00:38:09.460]   it all becomes corporate. The European bourgeois Internet where can't we all get along? Can
[00:38:09.460 --> 00:38:16.460]   we just behave please? And then the Chinese they say paternalistic Internet, which I think
[00:38:16.460 --> 00:38:22.980]   has been very terrible. Yes. And then the fifth is the Russian let's screw everything up
[00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:28.500]   just for the sake of screwing it up Internet. And I think that their their taxonomy kind
[00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:33.740]   of falls apart in places, but it's still a really interesting analysis. I give them this.
[00:38:33.740 --> 00:38:37.340]   Get into the Chinese part. You know, the fact that they call paternalistic and some people
[00:38:37.340 --> 00:38:42.900]   you do hear people here say, maybe we need to be more like China and control things.
[00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:47.220]   But there are there are there starts to be that belief is we need to do something must
[00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:50.820]   be done with control this Internet. Maybe the Chinese are on to something which scares
[00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:56.540]   me to death. And the other part of it is the business side of it, of course, which is no
[00:38:56.540 --> 00:39:00.460]   American company can go into China. Everybody even clear Rupert Murdoch who's tried the
[00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:08.340]   New York Times have failed and Google and Facebook couldn't get in. And so the the thong
[00:39:08.340 --> 00:39:13.780]   the fist on the scale that China government puts on is amazing. And then if you if you
[00:39:13.780 --> 00:39:19.060]   misspeak like Jack Ma, you know, you're in the you're in the Shay Wood shed for a long
[00:39:19.060 --> 00:39:25.580]   time. So it's not an Internet that I want, but interested in analyzing.
[00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:33.740]   I think it's only really a problem to be honest for companies that want to be across all those
[00:39:33.740 --> 00:39:41.260]   Internet's like Google. It's challenging for Apple, Google, Microsoft, meta, because they
[00:39:41.260 --> 00:39:46.860]   want to offer us because then then you end up with the lowest common and under freedom
[00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:51.060]   and the highest common denominator of regulation only in those companies though. I mean, we
[00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:55.780]   still have no internet because we know what what what if you're in Europe and they're
[00:39:55.780 --> 00:39:59.020]   demanding you do all this stuff you just say screw it is easier if I do it for the whole
[00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:07.220]   world. And then if you want to be in in China, you know, that's not really possible now,
[00:40:07.220 --> 00:40:12.660]   but that that would happen too. Well, Apple does that Apple cow tabs to China because they
[00:40:12.660 --> 00:40:14.580]   want to be in that market. It's a big market for them.
[00:40:14.580 --> 00:40:21.780]   So I was probably not the most actually it's exactly the right word. I don't know. Wow.
[00:40:21.780 --> 00:40:28.140]   It's exactly the right word. I think is exactly what they're doing. Is it is it now considered
[00:40:28.140 --> 00:40:33.260]   racist to say I don't know. I'm just I'm just I'm my antenna. I go yeah. I'm sure.
[00:40:33.260 --> 00:40:37.540]   Look it up. I don't know. This is the old bow. The head to the floor about excessively
[00:40:37.540 --> 00:40:45.740]   subservient. Neil and touch the ground with a forehead. That's hard. It is. It could do
[00:40:45.740 --> 00:40:53.180]   it. I'm sure it could do it. Yeah. I have my days where I can not many.
[00:40:53.180 --> 00:40:59.540]   According to Wikipedia, a cow toe is the active deep respect shown by prostration kneeling
[00:40:59.540 --> 00:41:06.260]   and bowing solo as to have one's head touch the ground in sinospheric culture. The cat
[00:41:06.260 --> 00:41:12.260]   has the highest sign of reverence. I don't think it exists. How is this how he required
[00:41:12.260 --> 00:41:20.380]   negative connotation in English language matters by Lisa. Let's see here. Okay. All right.
[00:41:20.380 --> 00:41:26.860]   We're doing doing Google's here. I don't know. Problem. I think Google off. I think it's
[00:41:26.860 --> 00:41:31.500]   a I think it's a good use of that word. Mind your language. How words are weaponized.
[00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:38.580]   I did it consciously because it is an American company now cow towing to the Chinese government.
[00:41:38.580 --> 00:41:44.460]   Yeah. I think it's a good word. Bow and down to the. Yeah. Yeah. I think it's a good word.
[00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:51.100]   All right. I defend my use of cow tow and I only make it. How many thousand dollars a
[00:41:51.100 --> 00:42:00.020]   day so you can't. Yo, she I know what she'd say. So I'm not. I trouble with her. All right.
[00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:04.820]   Yeah. I mean, I did. You're right. I mean, you don't want Lois common denominator internet,
[00:42:04.820 --> 00:42:09.660]   but at the same time, I don't think it's a bad thing to be regional and to have an internet
[00:42:09.660 --> 00:42:14.380]   in India that serves India as opposed to that's a really interesting question, Leo. So so if
[00:42:14.380 --> 00:42:21.140]   let me put this put it back to you this way. If you were Facebook starting today, but if
[00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:27.140]   you're starting something that wanted to be international, wouldn't it be better to not
[00:42:27.140 --> 00:42:31.300]   since Facebook started at at Harvard and then went out to universities that went to the
[00:42:31.300 --> 00:42:35.100]   country, right? If you were going to launch in that way, wouldn't it be better to say
[00:42:35.100 --> 00:42:42.780]   I'm going to run a different Facebook in Germany than I run in Indonesia and Malaysia than I
[00:42:42.780 --> 00:42:50.940]   run in the US. And that is it possible to have a worldwide service or that was a mistake?
[00:42:50.940 --> 00:42:56.660]   Well, I mean, I think that's who complaints mostly about this splinter net is the companies
[00:42:56.660 --> 00:43:05.100]   who cannot then do business across all those borders. I have a podcast network that is
[00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:11.500]   basically American centric. We have listeners all over the world. Great. Who I've met all
[00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:15.340]   over the world, by the way, which is one I've been in Munich and Australia where people
[00:43:15.340 --> 00:43:20.500]   come up to be on the street saying, Oh, twig, but I don't have aspirations. People ask
[00:43:20.500 --> 00:43:24.300]   me, we should do a Spanish language version of Twitter for South America. And I said,
[00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:29.140]   well, good, you do that. That's a great thing. You really should do that. I don't need to
[00:43:29.140 --> 00:43:34.740]   do that. I'm not trying to be a global, you know, international podcast network. I just
[00:43:34.740 --> 00:43:37.020]   want to hard enough be in America.
[00:43:37.020 --> 00:43:42.140]   But not ESPN. Yeah. So, but it's so much with the ESPN does. I don't think it's a bad
[00:43:42.140 --> 00:43:49.300]   thing for companies to operate in a sphere of influence and not say, well, we have we
[00:43:49.300 --> 00:43:54.260]   want to be everywhere. It's a hard thing to do. I feel bad for companies like Google
[00:43:54.260 --> 00:44:00.260]   that are trying to, you know, appease Russia. They gave up on China, which is I admire them
[00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:04.900]   for, right? Yes. Same here. Apple won't do that. It's just too big for their business.
[00:44:04.900 --> 00:44:11.620]   But Apple did give up on Russia. It's money. Yeah. Too much money. Too much money. Anyway,
[00:44:11.620 --> 00:44:17.140]   let's take a break. Come back with more. It's a small panel today. Nobody just scolded
[00:44:17.140 --> 00:44:25.340]   me or I try to help us understand chips. Stacy, I hope we'll be back next week. Jeff Jarvis
[00:44:25.340 --> 00:44:34.380]   is here and Ant Pruitt and our show today brought to you by a real podcast. I R L in
[00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:38.940]   real life, right? An original podcast from the great folks at Mozilla. I'm a big Mozilla
[00:44:38.940 --> 00:44:45.340]   fan. I love the Mozilla Corporation. IRL is a show for people who build AI, people who
[00:44:45.340 --> 00:44:49.900]   develop tech policies or just people like you and me who want to understand AI a little
[00:44:49.900 --> 00:44:55.140]   bit better. Brigitte Todd does a great job hosting it. This season of IRL looks at AI
[00:44:55.140 --> 00:45:02.780]   in real life. Who can AI help? Who can harm? Conversation is fascinating. I might add conversations
[00:45:02.780 --> 00:45:09.060]   with people who are working to build more trustworthy artificial intelligence. As an example, there's
[00:45:09.060 --> 00:45:14.620]   a show about how our world is being mapped with AI. The data missing from those maps is
[00:45:14.620 --> 00:45:18.380]   just as important, maybe even more so than the maps themselves. You hear about all the
[00:45:18.380 --> 00:45:22.020]   people who are working to fill in those gaps and take control of the data. There's another
[00:45:22.020 --> 00:45:28.340]   episode about gig workers who depend on apps for their livelihood. Of course, they're pushing
[00:45:28.340 --> 00:45:33.300]   back these days against algorithms that control how much they get paid. That's really a story
[00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:39.260]   right from today's headlines. Those gig workers seeking new ways to gain power over data.
[00:45:39.260 --> 00:45:42.980]   For political junkies, there's an episode about the role AI plays when it comes to the
[00:45:42.980 --> 00:45:48.460]   spread of disinformation around elections. Big concern these days. Another episode explains
[00:45:48.460 --> 00:45:55.740]   the role AI plays when it comes to elections and the spread of misinformation and hate speech.
[00:45:55.740 --> 00:46:01.220]   We talk about AI all the time. This is a show that's very informed, very intelligent that
[00:46:01.220 --> 00:46:09.020]   really talks about it in an issue by issue basis. IRL in real life. All you got to do
[00:46:09.020 --> 00:46:14.740]   is go to your favorite podcast player wherever you get your podcast and search for IRL or
[00:46:14.740 --> 00:46:20.260]   go to our show notes at twit.tv/twig. We'll have a link right there. Thank you, Mozilla,
[00:46:20.260 --> 00:46:29.260]   for supporting this week in Google. We're glad to support your podcast. IRL podcast.org/twit.
[00:46:29.260 --> 00:46:35.100]   Yeah, I love Mozilla. I use Firefox religiously. I'm a Mozilla fan. They are good people. They're
[00:46:35.100 --> 00:46:42.540]   good for the Internet. One of the reasons I really choose to use Firefox is because otherwise
[00:46:42.540 --> 00:46:50.020]   everything's Chrome or WebKit. I guess you're an Apple person, but Chrome is becoming the...
[00:46:50.020 --> 00:46:56.900]   As you know, monocultures bad for every living thing, including the Internet. I like to support
[00:46:56.900 --> 00:47:02.540]   an open source tool like Mozilla that doesn't use the Chrome Engine, the Chromium Engine.
[00:47:02.540 --> 00:47:11.500]   All right, Jeff, are you ready to pay $2 more for your Twitter blue? I am. Interesting.
[00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:18.020]   So yes, Sunday we had a poll. It's not all the panelists who said, "No way. We're going
[00:47:18.020 --> 00:47:25.540]   to pay five bucks." It said, "Three bucks for Twitter blue." Are you a Twitter blue guy?
[00:47:25.540 --> 00:47:32.460]   Sir, I was formerly a Twitter blue person. You dropped it. About a week and a half ago,
[00:47:32.460 --> 00:47:41.460]   my card expired. I just totally forgot about it. I got my new card just the other day, one
[00:47:41.460 --> 00:47:46.900]   day last week. I saw my notification about my Twitter blue subscription had failed. I
[00:47:46.900 --> 00:47:53.380]   was going to go back in and reactivate my $3 subscription. The reactivation was like,
[00:47:53.380 --> 00:47:59.620]   "No, it's not going to be three bucks." Oh, that's you lost. We're grandfathered in
[00:47:59.620 --> 00:48:04.340]   for a little bit. What's the deal? A little bit. Just a few months. Eventually, we're
[00:48:04.340 --> 00:48:09.620]   going to... I don't know. I mean... So I was like, "No, it's not worth that." I did enjoy
[00:48:09.620 --> 00:48:15.100]   using it because I enjoy top stories. It seemed to get better for me, but the stuff that was
[00:48:15.100 --> 00:48:21.940]   serving up. I also enjoyed the undo option just in case I have a typo in there and want
[00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:29.260]   to fix the typo. The whole ad-free stuff, I still think they need to work on that because
[00:48:29.260 --> 00:48:34.820]   if I wanted to see something from the LA Times, I couldn't never see it because I don't have
[00:48:34.820 --> 00:48:41.380]   an LA Times subscription unless I was reading those terms incorrectly, far as what the Twitter
[00:48:41.380 --> 00:48:47.860]   blue service included, but anything that was under LA Times or, I don't know, some other
[00:48:47.860 --> 00:48:52.780]   publication that had a... Washington Post, I couldn't read any of those. Washington Post
[00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:56.620]   was really inexpensive. I buy the Times by the Post.
[00:48:56.620 --> 00:49:01.620]   I did try to have a watch for a real close subscription at one time.
[00:49:01.620 --> 00:49:09.460]   I'm a little angry because I loved Nuzzle. Jonathan Abrams really great tool for news
[00:49:09.460 --> 00:49:14.700]   people that took your Twitter feed and then took the news stories out of it and just didn't
[00:49:14.700 --> 00:49:19.260]   have any tweets, just the list of news stories and the people who tweeted about it, so you
[00:49:19.260 --> 00:49:24.700]   could, I guess, read those tweets if you clicked. Then it would show news from your friends of
[00:49:24.700 --> 00:49:30.220]   your friends and then news from people you don't know and you got it. So I loved that.
[00:49:30.220 --> 00:49:36.420]   Twitter bottom and now they've buried it behind that paywall.
[00:49:36.420 --> 00:49:41.220]   So, I don't know. Is it worth five bucks a month? Because I don't, yeah, like you, I
[00:49:41.220 --> 00:49:47.620]   don't care. I also use it to back up on tweets even though the UI is not great.
[00:49:47.620 --> 00:49:51.820]   We need to change it to like change. You can change it to say, "Oh, see, I've tried
[00:49:51.820 --> 00:49:57.100]   it." So it's just, but that's just a, that's a discipline thing. Cause there, oh, you have
[00:49:57.100 --> 00:50:02.180]   to do is look at your tweet for a second or two before you. No, I don't do that. I know.
[00:50:02.180 --> 00:50:08.420]   But I don't do that. So, all right. You use that. There are those ad free with Twitter
[00:50:08.420 --> 00:50:14.260]   blue links to some stories. I don't find it enough stories to make it work. Is that working
[00:50:14.260 --> 00:50:19.020]   for you? That feature? Well, let's see. Here's, well, see, I already pay for the watch.
[00:50:19.020 --> 00:50:22.100]   You see, it's got that little banner thing. That little banner thing. Yeah. It's provided.
[00:50:22.100 --> 00:50:26.700]   Yeah. But I pay for the Washington Post. So I, oh, here the Rolling Stone. But, but I would
[00:50:26.700 --> 00:50:34.940]   think that this article will be free anyway. Is Rolling Stone behind a paywall? I don't,
[00:50:34.940 --> 00:50:39.740]   oh, yeah, it is. Well, no, no, no. And see, that's why I also assumed that, that little
[00:50:39.740 --> 00:50:45.580]   banner meant that you're seeing it there in your feed without having an ad present. Oh,
[00:50:45.580 --> 00:50:50.220]   no. That's what I sort of assumed. That's what they know. I thought it meant you could
[00:50:50.220 --> 00:50:54.660]   go to the site and then if you click that link, that site, but see, there's no difference.
[00:50:54.660 --> 00:50:59.860]   No, no, no. Answer it. No, it's, it's just the content. The scroll version is you see
[00:50:59.860 --> 00:51:06.500]   the, if you subscribe, you see it without an ad. Oh, okay. That's what that's all it
[00:51:06.500 --> 00:51:10.700]   does. That's the scroll. That's the screen. All right. That's what he held it. Okay.
[00:51:10.700 --> 00:51:14.620]   So I find this useful. They did add that feature where it's not just people you follow, but
[00:51:14.620 --> 00:51:20.740]   the people they follow, which I guess because I'm living in a bubble is exactly the same
[00:51:20.740 --> 00:51:30.260]   stories. So maybe if I didn't live in a bubble, it wouldn't be that way. I, I find that useful,
[00:51:30.260 --> 00:51:36.180]   but I don't know if it's five bucks a month useful. That's a no, not for me. Well, maybe
[00:51:36.180 --> 00:51:42.540]   as I listen, if you're a journalist, if Elon Musk owns it, no, no, F8 way, I'm going to
[00:51:42.540 --> 00:51:48.580]   put it on a penny. I'm not buying a Tesla. I'm not giving it a five bucks, but it's almost
[00:51:48.580 --> 00:51:52.740]   as if you know, the reason I subscribe to the Washington Post of New York Times is to help
[00:51:52.740 --> 00:51:56.300]   support them. I want us to support them. Just supporting them. I want to support Twitter.
[00:51:56.300 --> 00:52:02.820]   I respect that. I didn't have a problem with three bucks, not at all. For some reason,
[00:52:02.820 --> 00:52:06.380]   the extra two bucks just grinds my gears, I guess. I don't, I don't want to give them
[00:52:06.380 --> 00:52:10.100]   them. I'm right there with you. And I don't want to do it, but I guess I, I don't know.
[00:52:10.100 --> 00:52:16.660]   Probably well, probably well. Because you buy everything's, you can possibly buy an entire
[00:52:16.660 --> 00:52:24.060]   world. No, I buy, I support modern journalism is what I do. You bought 20 pictures of me
[00:52:24.060 --> 00:52:28.220]   for God's sakes. You can afford to support. Did you get any of that money?
[00:52:28.220 --> 00:52:35.220]   Not a, you know what else I bought? I bought a Roku. And you notice if you have a Roku
[00:52:35.220 --> 00:52:43.940]   that at the very bottom of the Roku remote control, there are buttons that take you direct. In
[00:52:43.940 --> 00:52:51.660]   my case to Netflix, Disney plus Hulu and Voodoo. What, and I figured this probably a case, they
[00:52:51.660 --> 00:52:55.220]   pay for those buttons. Do you want to know how much they pay for those buttons? We know
[00:52:55.220 --> 00:53:02.980]   much because Roku has revealed it in their latest quarterly report. It turns out they
[00:53:02.980 --> 00:53:10.420]   really make more money from the buttons than almost anything else. Yeah.
[00:53:10.420 --> 00:53:18.100]   About a buck per customer. So Disney plus another word played a buck per Roku user to
[00:53:18.100 --> 00:53:23.300]   have that button there, which means because there's four buttons. That's $4 for the remote.
[00:53:23.300 --> 00:53:34.020]   63 million active accounts times four. That's 240, 252 million dollars a year because of
[00:53:34.020 --> 00:53:39.340]   these buttons. What's funny is they change all the time. So the reason I brought in my
[00:53:39.340 --> 00:53:44.900]   remote, do you have a Roku remote? Anybody have a? I do. You said Disney plus on yours.
[00:53:44.900 --> 00:53:51.700]   And I'm thinking mine didn't say Disney plus it said like it changes Netflix, Hulu and
[00:53:51.700 --> 00:53:57.780]   maybe Amazon. It's whoever pays for it. I didn't know that. Yeah. So Leo, there was,
[00:53:57.780 --> 00:54:04.460]   I have it in my office. I don't have it here. Along with Qcat. The other thing that I got
[00:54:04.460 --> 00:54:10.660]   was this tablet is about this big and all it was was brands and buttons and a wire. You
[00:54:10.660 --> 00:54:14.660]   were supposed to plug this in to your computer because no one was going to do with these
[00:54:14.660 --> 00:54:22.660]   HTTPS slash slash colon, semi colon junk. The real estate you want to own is to be on
[00:54:22.660 --> 00:54:27.540]   this thing. Oh, yeah. Wall Street button, journal button there. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. It
[00:54:27.540 --> 00:54:36.260]   was only 25 years too soon and wrong in all kinds of ways. But yeah, on my TV remote,
[00:54:36.260 --> 00:54:43.460]   I have a Netflix button. Yeah. So they pay for that. And it's in its most recently,
[00:54:43.460 --> 00:54:49.860]   quarterly report. Roku was bemoaning the loss of button revenue.
[00:54:49.860 --> 00:54:58.900]   Wow. That's an entry on the ledger. The company said it had to adjust its forecasts
[00:54:58.900 --> 00:55:03.700]   because people haven't been buying as many Roku devices. According to the company's CFO,
[00:55:03.700 --> 00:55:08.660]   the main reason a dip in player sales affects its forecasts, this is from the Verge,
[00:55:09.540 --> 00:55:16.020]   would be a lower expectation of button revenues in certain deals where we've sold those deep
[00:55:16.020 --> 00:55:23.220]   link buttons on the remotes. They are losing money this quarter because of loss of button
[00:55:23.220 --> 00:55:29.780]   revenue. So what's the reporting in central forecasting in place? Isn't it some type of
[00:55:29.780 --> 00:55:34.340]   forecasting in place when you look at the pandemic and people were staying home or
[00:55:35.380 --> 00:55:40.980]   so those that could afford it probably bought another television to maximize.
[00:55:40.980 --> 00:55:45.220]   But then there's a recession. Now there's a recession. Now there's a recession.
[00:55:45.220 --> 00:55:49.940]   Then those people that just bought one probably are not going to buy in the TV for three to four
[00:55:49.940 --> 00:55:54.420]   years or so. Are they not forecasting any of this stuff? Oh, I'm sure they are. But they
[00:55:54.420 --> 00:56:00.340]   either didn't get it right or they knew it was going to happen. It happened.
[00:56:04.980 --> 00:56:11.540]   So anyway, according to this piece in the Verge and I should give credit to Mitchell Clark,
[00:56:11.540 --> 00:56:20.580]   the current buttons are Netflix. I got that Disney Plus and they've replaced my Hulu and
[00:56:20.580 --> 00:56:26.420]   Voodoo buttons with Apple TV Plus and Paramount Plus. That's three three out of four plus is
[00:56:26.420 --> 00:56:28.900]   what's online. You got Voodoo on here. So I got Voodoo.
[00:56:30.500 --> 00:56:35.460]   By the way, this is the pro remote that costs a dish you buy separately. It costs more.
[00:56:35.460 --> 00:56:39.300]   But still got the four buttons. Still got $4.00 and you buy remote without the buttons.
[00:56:39.300 --> 00:56:41.860]   But the buttons are actually useful except for Voodoo.
[00:56:41.860 --> 00:56:43.940]   Well, I am never going to Voodoo. That's for sure.
[00:56:43.940 --> 00:56:51.300]   Mitchell says, "I like to imagine that someone once received the worst remote ever
[00:56:51.300 --> 00:56:55.540]   only featuring buttons for streaming services they never use like sling,
[00:56:55.540 --> 00:57:02.420]   audio, PlayStation, view and Quibi." Wow. I'm glad mine doesn't have a Quibi button.
[00:57:02.420 --> 00:57:07.700]   That would be a collector's item. You do want a Quibi button.
[00:57:07.700 --> 00:57:14.740]   What tell me in chat room if you've got a Roku to hand what your buttons are? Because I know
[00:57:14.740 --> 00:57:21.220]   I got this maybe a year ago. So I'm sure they and probably I'm going to guess that whoever pays
[00:57:21.220 --> 00:57:27.060]   for these buttons only pays for a year. And then the button opens up and somebody else can come
[00:57:27.060 --> 00:57:31.940]   along and buy the button. But only if there's a new remote right here.
[00:57:31.940 --> 00:57:38.260]   Right. If you have an eight year old. So HD editor says, "Netflix Amazon,
[00:57:38.260 --> 00:57:42.100]   audio? Really? You've got audio on yours and Hulu?"
[00:57:44.020 --> 00:57:51.860]   Rever Mike says, "Netflix and Hulu buttons." I don't think anybody has a Quibi button. That would be so
[00:57:51.860 --> 00:57:57.940]   bad. Well, they should have done those as LCDs, right? So they could change them from HQ.
[00:57:57.940 --> 00:58:00.740]   "Wreckcon says Netflix, Hulu."
[00:58:00.740 --> 00:58:08.100]   Which is I think so. For pizza and Twitter.tv. I think you've got a special one.
[00:58:08.660 --> 00:58:13.860]   "Wreckcon. Declares says Netflix, Hulu, Voodoo and sling." So these do change, don't they?
[00:58:13.860 --> 00:58:21.300]   Interesting. By the way, Out of Sync is pointing out that the Chromecast with Google TV also has
[00:58:21.300 --> 00:58:28.420]   dedicated buttons. Only two of them. And one of them is a YouTube button. And this bugs me.
[00:58:28.420 --> 00:58:34.180]   Not YouTube TV, but YouTube. But I think, Out of Sync, correct me if I'm wrong, I think you can
[00:58:34.180 --> 00:58:37.940]   reassign those buttons. You can't on the Roku. They are what they are. There's not.
[00:58:37.940 --> 00:58:43.060]   Yeah, that's right. The Chromecast, one button is remappable, but not Netflix. So you could do
[00:58:43.060 --> 00:58:48.980]   the YouTube button. You can change. That's right. I remember that. Anyway, that's why Roku missed
[00:58:48.980 --> 00:58:56.660]   its second quarter estimates. That and a bunch of other things. People aren't watching much TV,
[00:58:56.660 --> 00:59:02.340]   etc, etc. Turns out Roku is not a hardware device. It's an advertising device.
[00:59:02.980 --> 00:59:08.500]   Well, that's true of everything in life. Amazon now has more advertising revenue
[00:59:08.500 --> 00:59:11.540]   than the magazine industry has revenue.
[00:59:11.540 --> 00:59:17.700]   Wait a minute. Say that again? Amazon has more advertising revenue than the magazine industry
[00:59:17.700 --> 00:59:22.580]   has total revenue. Total revenue. Wow. It's bigger than the magazine industry.
[00:59:22.580 --> 00:59:28.660]   It's amazing how the world has changed. Best buy. We've talked about this. The floor space is
[00:59:28.660 --> 00:59:34.260]   marketing space. That's true of all grocery stores, isn't it? They make more money from
[00:59:34.260 --> 00:59:36.660]   product placement. Yeah, it's only wires. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:59:36.660 --> 00:59:42.980]   Lena Kahn is kind of weighing in. You may remember she was made chairman of the federal.
[00:59:42.980 --> 00:59:45.300]   Talking about a thumb on the scale. Yeah.
[00:59:45.300 --> 00:59:51.620]   Well, you don't like that. Well, we'll see. She's the new chair, relatively new,
[00:59:51.620 --> 00:59:58.100]   Biden appointee, chair of the federal trade commission. When Meta said we want to acquire
[00:59:58.100 --> 01:00:04.340]   within, which makes the very, very popular VR app supernatural, which competes, by the way,
[01:00:04.340 --> 01:00:11.220]   with Meta's own fitness app. So it's acquiring a direct competitor.
[01:00:12.820 --> 01:00:21.780]   But it's, I mean, let's face it, VR fitness apps are kind of a small business. So Beat Saber
[01:00:21.780 --> 01:00:29.220]   is Meta's and the supernatural is within. Meta's trying to buy within. Staff said,
[01:00:29.220 --> 01:00:34.420]   yeah, forget it. As FTC staff is wanting to do, Lena Kahn overruled.
[01:00:35.860 --> 01:00:44.100]   And they are now going to oppose the acquisition of within. This is, we're going to start seeing
[01:00:44.100 --> 01:00:49.540]   more and more of this from Lena Kahn. Although I hear Tim Wu has left. Oh, so that's interesting.
[01:00:49.540 --> 01:00:53.380]   Tim Wu was also there. Another antitrust, you know, advocate.
[01:00:53.380 --> 01:01:00.180]   What do we think? First of all, are you familiar with supernatural and Beat Saber?
[01:01:01.940 --> 01:01:07.220]   Yeah, do I look fit? Alex Fitt, and he's not familiar with him. He doesn't.
[01:01:07.220 --> 01:01:14.020]   My kid plays Beat Saber for me. My kid plays Beat Saber on his Oculus Quest 2. He loves it.
[01:01:14.020 --> 01:01:19.220]   It's a really fun game. It's kind of like a Guitar Hero or something. The sounds are coming at you
[01:01:19.220 --> 01:01:23.940]   and you have a saber and you get it. Oh, okay. And so it's really, it's good exercise. Super
[01:01:23.940 --> 01:01:28.260]   natural cardio. Yeah, it's cardio. Similar, you're jumping around. I think you're shooting stuff
[01:01:28.260 --> 01:01:36.980]   instead. It does, you know, this admittedly, the FTC did nothing about Instagram. They did nothing
[01:01:36.980 --> 01:01:43.300]   about WhatsApp. Maybe they're saying, now's the time to slow meadow down a little bit.
[01:01:43.300 --> 01:01:50.100]   I can't imagine it's a very big business. But if there are only two companies making these VR
[01:01:50.100 --> 01:01:55.300]   fitness apps and Meadow wants to own them both, should they be allowed to do that?
[01:01:56.820 --> 01:02:02.100]   So Adam, is it a proud one of it? Go ahead, Jeff, first then you.
[01:02:02.100 --> 01:02:08.580]   All right. Adam Coba-sevich, I think Coba-sevich, I don't know if it answers David. Hi, Adam,
[01:02:08.580 --> 01:02:15.780]   who is the CEO of the Chamber of Progress, so libertarian Democrat kind of crossover.
[01:02:15.780 --> 01:02:22.020]   Has been arguing against it, said that it's not a vertical case arguing that it is going to lock
[01:02:22.020 --> 01:02:28.900]   up the whole VR stack. It's a speculative horizontal case arguing that I could, that word again,
[01:02:28.900 --> 01:02:35.940]   monopolize a narrow VR dedicated fitness app market. I also saw, I think Benedict, and by the
[01:02:35.940 --> 01:02:39.380]   way, I should point out there's nothing to stop some third party from coming along and saying,
[01:02:39.380 --> 01:02:43.860]   I'm going to make it even better VR fitness app. It's a tiny market.
[01:02:43.860 --> 01:02:50.020]   So it's a punishment of meta. She just wanted to pounce on the first thing that she could.
[01:02:50.980 --> 01:02:57.300]   It's not, I don't think there's good antitrust here at all. Am I fear of this publicity?
[01:02:57.300 --> 01:03:02.100]   Well, no, no, no, I think it's politics. I think it's saying, see, I'm going after him,
[01:03:02.100 --> 01:03:05.940]   I'm tough, I'm going to get him, look at me, I went after Mark Zuckerberg, while he's down.
[01:03:05.940 --> 01:03:11.620]   It's like the EU kicking Microsoft when they were down. My fear of this, I don't care about
[01:03:11.620 --> 01:03:17.300]   meta, they bottle a lot of stuff and maybe we can argue about whether they should have bought
[01:03:17.300 --> 01:03:20.180]   Instagram or whether their Instagram was too small at the time, we've argued about that before in
[01:03:20.180 --> 01:03:27.860]   the show. My fear is that if her thumb on the scale becomes too much, we turn into Europe,
[01:03:27.860 --> 01:03:32.420]   where investors are going to be scared of investing in companies because they're fewer exits.
[01:03:32.420 --> 01:03:44.500]   So it's a non-market interference on the exit market, on the IPO and acquisition market.
[01:03:45.380 --> 01:03:51.940]   And that's where I worry about the innovation that's kept us going in this country over Europe.
[01:03:51.940 --> 01:03:56.500]   Everybody, Europe's jealous. Why? Because we, this country invests and they don't.
[01:03:56.500 --> 01:04:01.300]   They just don't have, I remember talking about this with Loeweke and Merdering,
[01:04:01.300 --> 01:04:08.420]   Loewebe quite a bit. They just don't have the robust infrastructure for VC,
[01:04:08.420 --> 01:04:12.420]   capital, they don't know the guts. They culturally don't have the guts.
[01:04:12.420 --> 01:04:17.700]   He says, and I think this is another angle on what you're saying, which is that failure is not
[01:04:17.700 --> 01:04:21.060]   celebrated in the same way in Europe that it's celebrated in the US.
[01:04:21.060 --> 01:04:26.820]   It's fetishized in the US, but it's shunned in Europe. You never want, I've had this discussion
[01:04:26.820 --> 01:04:31.780]   with Germans constantly. Oh, no, no, no, we never want to admit being wrong or failing in public.
[01:04:31.780 --> 01:04:36.500]   No, no, no, no. I know people are against Facebook going in and gobbling up different
[01:04:36.500 --> 01:04:43.140]   companies or what have you. But what if, what if other companies are, that's, that's their mission?
[01:04:43.140 --> 01:04:47.380]   I think we've talked about this. Well, that's what that's exactly what Jeff was saying is like
[01:04:47.380 --> 01:04:52.420]   for a lot of companies, but I'm questioning, see, maybe I'm being moralistic.
[01:04:52.420 --> 01:04:56.900]   A lot of companies, the whole idea you've found the company in order to get acquired.
[01:04:56.900 --> 01:04:58.660]   That's their mission, right? Right.
[01:04:58.660 --> 01:05:00.660]   The YouTube wouldn't do it.
[01:05:00.660 --> 01:05:05.380]   It's just, if they had been wrong for coming in and saying here, we'll give you some of this,
[01:05:05.380 --> 01:05:08.180]   this money that you really, really wanted all this time.
[01:05:08.180 --> 01:05:11.780]   Is Facebook in the wrong for that?
[01:05:11.780 --> 01:05:16.500]   I'm just, well, that's not what the FTC's worried about. They're worried about the Facebook
[01:05:16.500 --> 01:05:23.540]   when not realizing the tiny VR fitness market. But I think Jeff's right. It's kind of
[01:05:23.540 --> 01:05:27.700]   con saying like I got to get in, I got to get my, my foot in here somewhere. I'm tough.
[01:05:27.700 --> 01:05:30.660]   It just sounds like grandstand into me. It does too. Again,
[01:05:30.660 --> 01:05:34.980]   but and maybe this is very old fashioned. I'll let you both yell at me for this.
[01:05:34.980 --> 01:05:39.780]   I don't like the idea of businesses being founded in order to be bought.
[01:05:39.780 --> 01:05:45.940]   Like that. I agree with you. It feels like that's all. I'll yell at them.
[01:05:45.940 --> 01:05:48.100]   You go ahead and agree with them first, then I'll yell at them.
[01:05:48.100 --> 01:05:53.620]   I agree with you. If I, if I'm creating a product or widget or what have you, that is
[01:05:53.620 --> 01:05:58.820]   essentially my baby, you know, they're quotes. That's my baby. And I want to see my baby grow up
[01:05:58.820 --> 01:06:05.460]   and flourish and just be the biggest, baddest widget on the planet. But that's, that's just how
[01:06:05.460 --> 01:06:10.580]   I think. But I know that this, this, I think it's a generational thing or people are thinking,
[01:06:10.580 --> 01:06:16.740]   okay, well, let's come up with this little magical idea and just get ready for our payday.
[01:06:16.740 --> 01:06:18.100]   That's where my problem is.
[01:06:18.100 --> 01:06:22.900]   Is that they start with the idea of we're going to sell it. I mean, I, look, if somebody came
[01:06:22.900 --> 01:06:27.300]   along and offered me $50 million, I'd probably sell them to it. I'm not against the idea of selling.
[01:06:27.300 --> 01:06:34.740]   But in the 35, go ahead and try. Let me know when it happens. No, no 50. But, but, because I got
[01:06:34.740 --> 01:06:41.140]   to save some for Anne, but I don't, I don't, I don't, I feel funny for me to start a business
[01:06:41.140 --> 01:06:45.060]   with that as your intent. But maybe there's, well, let me give you, let me give you two scenarios.
[01:06:45.060 --> 01:06:51.540]   Okay. Where our base says, YouTube was in no possible way sustainable. It could not last much
[01:06:51.540 --> 01:06:56.820]   longer than it did. Right. It was a great idea about to be out of existence. Yeah.
[01:06:56.820 --> 01:07:01.380]   Everything. And they couldn't afford the bandwidth. They couldn't afford anything, but it was visionary.
[01:07:01.380 --> 01:07:10.820]   And they had to find a buyer to be able to live ways. Ways is I depend upon ways immensely. It's
[01:07:10.820 --> 01:07:17.060]   great. It was made on its own and Google left it independent working inside. But I don't think it
[01:07:17.060 --> 01:07:22.660]   could have grown to the service that it is with its incredible data around the world of all of
[01:07:22.660 --> 01:07:28.580]   our driving and all of our streets and all of that, if it hadn't had, again, Google come in and buy it.
[01:07:28.580 --> 01:07:33.540]   So I think there is a position where you start something because if you tried to start ways within
[01:07:33.540 --> 01:07:37.060]   Google, you'd end up with Google Maps and it didn't do everything it was supposed to do.
[01:07:37.060 --> 01:07:41.380]   You're better off starting some things outside and look how many people leave big companies to
[01:07:41.380 --> 01:07:46.340]   start it than only going back when they get bought because they have more freedom outside to do it.
[01:07:46.340 --> 01:07:51.060]   But they know that they, they have a long way to go to get sustainability. And the past is
[01:07:51.060 --> 01:07:57.700]   sustainability independently. Yeah, maybe you get richer, but you also end up with awful boards of
[01:07:57.700 --> 01:08:03.780]   horrible VCs and a long time and it's a pain in the butt. And sometimes you're better off inside
[01:08:03.780 --> 01:08:09.140]   the firm. So I don't think it's always a cynical act. It can be, which what you're saying is, we'll
[01:08:09.140 --> 01:08:16.420]   come up with this thing. And that's that. But I do think there is a case for investment in startups
[01:08:16.420 --> 01:08:23.860]   that where purchase is an appropriate exit for the investors and founders. And I worry about what
[01:08:23.860 --> 01:08:29.460]   happens to that path. Yeah, I wonder what's going on on the education side of things. You know,
[01:08:29.460 --> 01:08:34.740]   what's what's being taught in schools? Because this is a whole different approach from, you know,
[01:08:34.740 --> 01:08:40.340]   umpteen years ago when I was in class and they tell they're telling you to be able to be proficient
[01:08:40.340 --> 01:08:44.260]   in this subject and that subject so you can go torch this career and that career and be able to
[01:08:44.260 --> 01:08:49.540]   provide for your family or they now saying, okay, make sure you optimize your tick tock and get
[01:08:49.540 --> 01:08:55.860]   all of the hashtags. And but what is being said in class for us, you know, starting your own business?
[01:08:55.860 --> 01:09:01.780]   Do you know? Is it something that's? I think if you're the ones with kids in
[01:09:01.780 --> 01:09:07.860]   school still, but I but I well, they're telling well, they're asking me stuff and yeah,
[01:09:07.860 --> 01:09:13.380]   and I tell them, look, I want you to go to college, but I can't really push college on you because I
[01:09:13.380 --> 01:09:19.780]   think college is overpriced. But yet at the same time, I enjoy the college experience and the
[01:09:19.780 --> 01:09:24.820]   stuff that you're going to learn as a human being, but you don't lose unless you go to business school,
[01:09:24.820 --> 01:09:29.940]   you don't learn entrepreneurship and you go to a journalism school and learn because after all,
[01:09:29.940 --> 01:09:35.700]   I do head the Taldite Center for Entrepreneur Entrepreneur. It says it right here, entrepreneurial.
[01:09:38.100 --> 01:09:43.620]   But it says that laminated. The reason it says that is because most of the time it's not
[01:09:43.620 --> 01:09:48.740]   entrepreneurial. Absolutely. Right. Most J schools are not. And so it's in it's it's in
[01:09:48.740 --> 01:09:51.380]   exception, exception. Because we're exceptional. Yes.
[01:09:51.380 --> 01:09:57.460]   You know, I don't know. I guess I guess what we should do is get some venture capitalists on and
[01:09:57.460 --> 01:10:02.500]   they could probably argue the case that it that it's fine to start a business with the idea of
[01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:09.140]   having an exit. I know who would be great is. Um, uh, both John Borthwick. Okay.
[01:10:09.140 --> 01:10:16.100]   Because John started, uh, uh, for example, he started a, uh, when Twitter started, it had no
[01:10:16.100 --> 01:10:19.220]   search engine. He said, was it ridiculous? Got a research engine? Twitter wasn't doing it.
[01:10:19.220 --> 01:10:22.260]   She said, I'm going to start a company. It's a search engine. Guess who was going to buy them?
[01:10:22.260 --> 01:10:27.700]   Right. Twitter. Right. But he ended up doing development for Twitter. It was as more expensive
[01:10:27.700 --> 01:10:33.860]   for Twitter that way. I guess it makes sense that there are, if what we want to do is foster, uh,
[01:10:33.860 --> 01:10:39.860]   invention, innovation, creation, it makes sense that some companies are started
[01:10:39.860 --> 01:10:45.620]   with an idea like that of it. Well, it's not going to be a tenable standalone company,
[01:10:45.620 --> 01:10:48.580]   but probably Twitter would want to buy it. I guess there's nothing wrong with that.
[01:10:48.580 --> 01:10:54.020]   I mean, that's on the other hand. So I've, I've, I've, I've been writing a little book about
[01:10:54.020 --> 01:10:58.980]   magazines. Uh, and so in it, I'm reliving the, the start of entertainment weekly. And so I have
[01:10:58.980 --> 01:11:08.980]   my files from, from there, which is somewhat painful to relive. Um, and we, uh, the, the publisher,
[01:11:08.980 --> 01:11:13.700]   who at the time was my friend and throughout the long, the long term he was, but, uh, and I,
[01:11:13.700 --> 01:11:20.900]   um, had pushed it. Uh, we got favorable research of what we're going to start this thing. And then
[01:11:20.900 --> 01:11:25.940]   timing being timing, appointed a task force to come up with every reason not to do it. So they
[01:11:25.940 --> 01:11:31.060]   could say that they'd done that. Um, and so then the publisher got all angry. He was CFO of the
[01:11:31.060 --> 01:11:35.460]   magazine company and he sent them a memo, which I still have, which said, well, damn it, this is
[01:11:35.460 --> 01:11:39.380]   all bull. Um, just give us the, just give Jeff and me the idea and we'll go out and find
[01:11:39.380 --> 01:11:43.220]   them how to do it. And we'll do this. No, no, no, no, no, no, we start the magazine.
[01:11:43.220 --> 01:11:48.660]   The magazine went through well, well, well, more than a hundred million dollars lost before
[01:11:48.660 --> 01:11:53.620]   broke even. Right. So in that case, we couldn't have started outside. It had to be started inside
[01:11:53.620 --> 01:11:58.660]   a company because only that size, that was the last large magazine launch that'll ever occur in
[01:11:58.660 --> 01:12:04.180]   history. I was that one, uh, help kill them. Um, uh, right. So some things have to start inside
[01:12:04.180 --> 01:12:08.900]   the company because they are that capital intensive, but some things are better if they're
[01:12:08.900 --> 01:12:13.060]   innovation intensive to start outside, which really sounds horribly business school to me.
[01:12:13.060 --> 01:12:17.220]   I apologize for that. Well, what have I speaking of journalism? Uh, what about this?
[01:12:17.220 --> 01:12:21.620]   Meta started telling people yesterday, we're not going to give you money anymore.
[01:12:21.620 --> 01:12:29.300]   Meta had paid about a hundred five million dollars to, they had three year deals with publishers.
[01:12:29.300 --> 01:12:34.420]   They set up a couple of, well, three years ago, uh, as part of their investment in news,
[01:12:34.420 --> 01:12:39.780]   they hired journalists to help direct publisher traffic to its new tab for news and they were
[01:12:39.780 --> 01:12:46.260]   giving money, uh, to companies. Let me see. I think Axios has some numbers. Uh,
[01:12:46.260 --> 01:12:53.300]   it was 10 million to the 10 million to the journal, 3 million to the CNN, more than 20 million to the
[01:12:53.300 --> 01:12:59.220]   New York times. Uh, in some cases, you got what you get with Twitter blue unlocked paywall content.
[01:12:59.220 --> 01:13:06.820]   Uh, men says, eh, nevermind. Last stop on the gravy train.
[01:13:06.820 --> 01:13:13.460]   Yeah. Is that another case of the thumb on the scales or is it important? No, this is, this is,
[01:13:14.020 --> 01:13:20.740]   it was always bakshish. It was always, it was always blackmail, right? Um, and it didn't work. So, so,
[01:13:20.740 --> 01:13:29.460]   if we're, if we're nice to you, Murdoch, we shut up and stop trying to, um, uh, lobby governments
[01:13:29.460 --> 01:13:33.860]   for protectionism. Oh, okay. If you actually pay us, we will. And I was there at the event held the
[01:13:33.860 --> 01:13:40.500]   Museum of Broadcasting in New York, Campbell Brown and, um, uh, not Mark Thompson, um, the other
[01:13:40.500 --> 01:13:46.740]   Thompson at News Corp, uh, the president of News Corp, uh, up on stage, uh, basically the, the check
[01:13:46.740 --> 01:13:51.140]   has practically passed and okay, we'll be nice now. What happened after that? Australian.
[01:13:51.140 --> 01:14:01.060]   And, um, the effort by News Corp to, um, make publishers pay again and even more and more European
[01:14:01.060 --> 01:14:07.220]   regulation, a plenty. And so it didn't work. The news tab that was created on Facebook, Zuckabric
[01:14:07.220 --> 01:14:09.620]   said at the time, well, uh, not many people are going to use it.
[01:14:09.620 --> 01:14:17.220]   Like sand through the hourglass. So are the days of our lives. I'm sorry.
[01:14:17.220 --> 01:14:20.980]   Did I interrupt you, Jeff?
[01:14:20.980 --> 01:14:28.740]   That's for the next story, what I just did to you.
[01:14:28.740 --> 01:14:33.300]   You do. A little, a little, I thought I was, yeah, you had, I had, I was going a little too long.
[01:14:33.300 --> 01:14:40.260]   No, no, it was a little late in, uh, sound from the next story. You could, you couldn't use that as a,
[01:14:40.260 --> 01:14:44.260]   as a gimmick in the future. So plop from Jeff.
[01:14:44.260 --> 01:14:58.420]   Our lives. You know why I'm playing that theme song? I cannot figure it out.
[01:14:58.420 --> 01:15:06.020]   There's got to be a reason NBC is moving its longest running series, Days of Our Lives, off
[01:15:06.020 --> 01:15:11.460]   broadcast to streaming to pick up something.
[01:15:11.460 --> 01:15:18.180]   Help something will make people watch Peacock. Somebody watch Peacock, by the way, zero subscriber
[01:15:18.180 --> 01:15:25.140]   growth in the last quarter zero. Yeah. Yeah. Not good. Supplies losses starting September 12th,
[01:15:25.140 --> 01:15:28.580]   all new episodes. Yeah, who's going to be about it? Oh, no, no losses subscribers.
[01:15:28.580 --> 01:15:34.820]   Probably yes, they, this is, this is churn and they lost a whole bunch of people and then they had,
[01:15:34.820 --> 01:15:40.660]   they had to market just to get back to even. And now they're moving their longest running show,
[01:15:40.660 --> 01:15:44.500]   which must be doing poorly, right? Otherwise you wouldn't, but maybe it's not. I don't know.
[01:15:44.500 --> 01:15:49.300]   All new episodes of the show will debut on Peacock Daily, Peacock Premium.
[01:15:49.300 --> 01:15:54.340]   Subscribers will be able to access past shows if you lose, if you miss an episode of your show.
[01:15:55.140 --> 01:16:00.740]   And it will be replaced by a news show, NBC News Daily, an hour long program.
[01:16:00.740 --> 01:16:08.340]   Oh, that's, that's got to improve the ratings. Anchored by Kate Snow, Aaron Gilchrist, Vicki Nguyen,
[01:16:08.340 --> 01:16:16.740]   and Morgan Radford. You know, mom wants to watch an hour news for instead of Days of Our Lives.
[01:16:16.740 --> 01:16:22.340]   The 2021 season of the Israel Lives Average of 0.3 rating. Oh, that's not so good. The 18 to 49
[01:16:22.340 --> 01:16:27.060]   female demographic with 1.7 million total viewers. Well, that's not bad for a middle of the day.
[01:16:27.060 --> 01:16:33.140]   Show. 8 times. And a bad 14,000th episode aired in 2020.
[01:16:33.140 --> 01:16:38.500]   Set in the fictional Midwestern city of Salem. It resolves around the Brady,
[01:16:38.500 --> 01:16:45.060]   Horton and Demira families. It debuted in 1965. Days of our lives. Take a guess. How many Emmys?
[01:16:45.060 --> 01:16:51.060]   Days of our lives as well. Two, three, five, 58.
[01:16:52.260 --> 01:16:54.900]   Wow. 58.
[01:16:54.900 --> 01:16:59.300]   And a daytime Emmy. It doesn't count. And that's only a daytime.
[01:16:59.300 --> 01:17:04.660]   I have to say the only thing worse than the daytime Emmy I have, which is a regional Emmy.
[01:17:04.660 --> 01:17:05.300]   Regional Emmy.
[01:17:05.300 --> 01:17:15.460]   Do you ever, and I feel like you might occasionally buy an occasional dumb, dumb lollipop.
[01:17:15.460 --> 01:17:18.260]   Do you? Yes. You do.
[01:17:19.300 --> 01:17:22.740]   Simple pleasure. I think it's a Southern brand, I want to say. I don't know.
[01:17:22.740 --> 01:17:28.660]   So here's a story from Bloomberg.
[01:17:28.660 --> 01:17:30.900]   Mitch, I don't know why.
[01:17:30.900 --> 01:17:33.140]   Mitch Bloomberg Business Week.
[01:17:33.140 --> 01:17:40.100]   Mitchell Owens recently discovered that mysterious entities were selling bulk orders of dumb,
[01:17:40.100 --> 01:17:45.700]   dumb lollipops on Amazon for a couple of bucks less than the price charged by his company.
[01:17:46.660 --> 01:17:52.180]   Spangler Candy Company, which makes dumb dums. So he placed an order from one of the Amazon
[01:17:52.180 --> 01:17:57.460]   merchants a few days later, a 500 pack of lollipops arrived on his doorstep. They weren't counterfeit
[01:17:57.460 --> 01:18:02.180]   and strangely had been shipped directly from Sam's Club.
[01:18:02.180 --> 01:18:12.180]   It's a get ready for this, a price arbitrage scheme, which is illegal, according to Amazon.
[01:18:12.180 --> 01:18:15.620]   They don't want people, not illegal like you go to jail. I guess the rules.
[01:18:15.620 --> 01:18:17.140]   You go to Amazon jail for it.
[01:18:17.140 --> 01:18:24.580]   Terms of service. Sellers, often guided by how to tutorials on YouTube, TikTok and Instagram,
[01:18:24.580 --> 01:18:30.180]   scour the internet for products with lower prices than Amazon. Then they post the items on the
[01:18:30.180 --> 01:18:35.700]   website, wait for someone to place an order, wait, they don't even buy it yet, right? No inventory,
[01:18:35.700 --> 01:18:41.300]   purchase the product, drop ship directly to the customer and take the difference.
[01:18:42.660 --> 01:18:48.820]   And they never actually touch the merchandise. It is a violation of Amazon policy.
[01:18:48.820 --> 01:18:54.180]   But because Amazon's so big, good luck.
[01:18:54.180 --> 01:18:54.900]   Hard to notice.
[01:18:54.900 --> 01:18:56.260]   Here is...
[01:18:56.260 --> 01:18:58.820]   I thought this hustle has been going on for a while though, sir.
[01:18:58.820 --> 01:18:59.380]   It has.
[01:18:59.380 --> 01:18:59.860]   Yeah.
[01:18:59.860 --> 01:19:00.980]   Five, six years.
[01:19:00.980 --> 01:19:05.620]   With dumb dums, the sellers are leveraging a yawning price gap between Sam's Club,
[01:19:05.620 --> 01:19:10.180]   which sells a deeply discounted 500 pack of lollipops for about $15.
[01:19:11.220 --> 01:19:16.100]   And Amazon, where Spangler sells its exclusive 400 pack for $26,
[01:19:16.100 --> 01:19:22.740]   sellers can charge $25 on Amazon to lure price conscious shoppers in pocket about $6
[01:19:22.740 --> 01:19:23.940]   after subtracting Amazon's fees.
[01:19:23.940 --> 01:19:25.220]   Yeah, that's a sour brush.
[01:19:25.220 --> 01:19:31.540]   If you go all the way down to line 151, one of my numbers...
[01:19:31.540 --> 01:19:33.940]   Am I done talking about the lollipop drop shippers?
[01:19:33.940 --> 01:19:34.900]   Yes, I am actually.
[01:19:34.900 --> 01:19:39.940]   I just wanted to say the words lollipop drop shippers.
[01:19:41.140 --> 01:19:42.340]   This is a business inside.
[01:19:42.340 --> 01:19:43.460]   I say that five times fast.
[01:19:43.460 --> 01:19:43.540]   Yeah.
[01:19:43.540 --> 01:19:46.340]   This is a business insider article.
[01:19:46.340 --> 01:19:49.860]   I quit my job to buy and resell used books on Amazon.
[01:19:49.860 --> 01:19:54.820]   Now I use my six figure income to travel the world.
[01:19:54.820 --> 01:19:55.300]   To travel the world.
[01:19:55.300 --> 01:19:56.100]   For taste of the...
[01:19:56.100 --> 01:19:59.860]   So she drops, she goes to a used bookstore, she buys the books,
[01:19:59.860 --> 01:20:03.620]   she strips them to Amazon, and then the rest just happens.
[01:20:03.620 --> 01:20:08.900]   People buy it on Amazon and Amazon ships it and she gets her pennies and she travels the world.
[01:20:09.620 --> 01:20:11.620]   How can I do that?
[01:20:11.620 --> 01:20:13.540]   I know, I think that's my retirement.
[01:20:13.540 --> 01:20:14.420]   I think that's what I do.
[01:20:14.420 --> 01:20:16.020]   So I don't want to sell any of the books I have.
[01:20:16.020 --> 01:20:16.740]   That's the problem.
[01:20:16.740 --> 01:20:20.740]   So she's traveling around the US going to use bookstores.
[01:20:20.740 --> 01:20:22.180]   She did that already.
[01:20:22.180 --> 01:20:23.940]   She's not like going to Florence.
[01:20:23.940 --> 01:20:25.140]   She's going around the US.
[01:20:25.140 --> 01:20:26.180]   No, she did that already.
[01:20:26.180 --> 01:20:28.980]   But once she did that and got enough books in Amazon's warehouse,
[01:20:28.980 --> 01:20:31.220]   she said, "See you later.
[01:20:31.220 --> 01:20:33.460]   I'm going to Turkey."
[01:20:33.460 --> 01:20:35.060]   So I often will buy...
[01:20:35.060 --> 01:20:36.260]   You should use mailboxes money.
[01:20:36.260 --> 01:20:38.980]   I will often buy used books on Amazon.
[01:20:38.980 --> 01:20:43.380]   A lot of the programming books, especially the old ones I want to buy,
[01:20:43.380 --> 01:20:44.900]   that's the only way to get them is used.
[01:20:44.900 --> 01:20:45.620]   Right.
[01:20:45.620 --> 01:20:47.460]   Most of the time I think they come from a bookstore,
[01:20:47.460 --> 01:20:49.860]   but occasionally you get shipped and fulfilled by Amazon.
[01:20:49.860 --> 01:20:53.060]   That means that somebody like this woman has gone around and found these books.
[01:20:53.060 --> 01:20:56.180]   Amazon will store them for you for a fee, right?
[01:20:56.180 --> 01:20:58.820]   It's all for a fee, but what the hell?
[01:20:58.820 --> 01:21:04.180]   Plus, my local old used bookstore doesn't list their inventory on Amazon
[01:21:05.060 --> 01:21:05.940]   or anywhere.
[01:21:05.940 --> 01:21:08.340]   And so there's some stuff that's really cheap.
[01:21:08.340 --> 01:21:09.700]   I just got...
[01:21:09.700 --> 01:21:13.700]   For the magazine book, I went there and bought some old life magazines.
[01:21:13.700 --> 01:21:19.460]   I have the Life Kennedy Shot with Zabruder Film issue for two dollars.
[01:21:19.460 --> 01:21:23.300]   I'm going to bet I can sell that for more money, buddy.
[01:21:23.300 --> 01:21:26.500]   Well, I have this fine picture of a handsome gentleman.
[01:21:26.500 --> 01:21:28.740]   Former TV guy, I do predict.
[01:21:28.740 --> 01:21:29.700]   If somebody's going to buy...
[01:21:29.700 --> 01:21:31.860]   If some shmuck is going to buy even that...
[01:21:33.140 --> 01:21:36.580]   Don't you think this probably was somebody's arbitrage come to think of it?
[01:21:36.580 --> 01:21:38.660]   It was an old...
[01:21:38.660 --> 01:21:41.140]   They bought a file of old press pictures.
[01:21:41.140 --> 01:21:41.620]   Exactly.
[01:21:41.620 --> 01:21:42.260]   Press releases.
[01:21:42.260 --> 01:21:42.660]   Yeah.
[01:21:42.660 --> 01:21:45.220]   I'm pretty sure they're not traveling the world.
[01:21:45.220 --> 01:21:50.660]   Based on the big bucks from Jeff Jarvis portraits.
[01:21:50.660 --> 01:21:51.780]   Selling Jeff Jarvis.
[01:21:51.780 --> 01:21:52.100]   Yeah.
[01:21:52.100 --> 01:21:53.300]   That would be kind of my run.
[01:21:53.300 --> 01:21:56.580]   Yeah, I've been kind of aware of this whole idea of drop shipping for a long time,
[01:21:56.580 --> 01:21:57.220]   because...
[01:21:57.220 --> 01:21:59.540]   And I think anybody who buys on Amazon has,
[01:21:59.540 --> 01:22:01.620]   because frequently you'll order something,
[01:22:01.620 --> 01:22:05.300]   and it kind of like comes in this like beat up box bubble wrap.
[01:22:05.300 --> 01:22:05.860]   Beat up box.
[01:22:05.860 --> 01:22:10.660]   Like some guy bought it at Sam's Club and then threw it in a box and sent it to you.
[01:22:10.660 --> 01:22:11.140]   Yeah.
[01:22:11.140 --> 01:22:11.460]   Yeah.
[01:22:11.460 --> 01:22:11.940]   And it's just our...
[01:22:11.940 --> 01:22:12.740]   It's arbitrage.
[01:22:12.740 --> 01:22:16.580]   It's the difference between the price he paid for it and the price that I paid on Amazon.
[01:22:16.580 --> 01:22:18.660]   And I always figure when that happens,
[01:22:18.660 --> 01:22:20.660]   I'm just paying for the convenience, right?
[01:22:20.660 --> 01:22:25.220]   Because I didn't have to go to that Sam's Club to pick it up.
[01:22:25.220 --> 01:22:25.780]   Right.
[01:22:25.780 --> 01:22:26.100]   Right.
[01:22:26.100 --> 01:22:29.140]   Well, you're finding things you just couldn't find otherwise.
[01:22:29.140 --> 01:22:30.820]   But a lot of the stuff, yeah, you...
[01:22:30.820 --> 01:22:35.140]   Maybe I buy obscure stuff, but a lot of the stuff I order on Amazon is like that.
[01:22:35.140 --> 01:22:35.940]   You know, it's just...
[01:22:35.940 --> 01:22:37.700]   Ponderful, by the way, do you use book finder?
[01:22:37.700 --> 01:22:39.220]   Yes.
[01:22:39.220 --> 01:22:40.260]   After you told us about it.
[01:22:40.260 --> 01:22:40.900]   That's the best.
[01:22:40.900 --> 01:22:41.300]   Oh, I did.
[01:22:41.300 --> 01:22:41.460]   Okay.
[01:22:41.460 --> 01:22:42.100]   Yeah, it's the best.
[01:22:42.100 --> 01:22:42.820]   Yeah.
[01:22:42.820 --> 01:22:43.220]   I should...
[01:22:43.220 --> 01:22:44.500]   I have to remember that though.
[01:22:44.500 --> 01:22:49.140]   It's a meta search engine of all the use book search engines and a spectacular...
[01:22:49.140 --> 01:22:49.780]   Yeah.
[01:22:49.780 --> 01:22:50.500]   So let's see.
[01:22:50.500 --> 01:22:52.180]   I want to just see if Paul Graham...
[01:22:52.180 --> 01:22:58.340]   I spent like 60 bucks for this book called On LISP by Paul Graham.
[01:23:00.500 --> 01:23:03.300]   Because it's out of print.
[01:23:03.300 --> 01:23:05.460]   It's a very valuable book.
[01:23:05.460 --> 01:23:09.060]   This is it On LISP used...
[01:23:09.060 --> 01:23:12.180]   Ooh, 82 dollars.
[01:23:12.180 --> 01:23:13.300]   I got a deal.
[01:23:13.300 --> 01:23:13.780]   That's rare.
[01:23:13.780 --> 01:23:15.540]   You only find one book matching.
[01:23:15.540 --> 01:23:16.580]   That's really rare.
[01:23:16.580 --> 01:23:17.780]   That ship from Japan.
[01:23:17.780 --> 01:23:18.660]   Ship from Japan.
[01:23:18.660 --> 01:23:19.940]   That's probably why it's so expensive.
[01:23:19.940 --> 01:23:21.300]   Yeah.
[01:23:21.300 --> 01:23:23.220]   Let me see if I can find it on Amazon actually.
[01:23:23.220 --> 01:23:27.460]   Now that we're in this loop, we can edit this out too.
[01:23:27.460 --> 01:23:29.540]   Packet, let's just edit out most of the show.
[01:23:29.540 --> 01:23:32.900]   Jeez.
[01:23:32.900 --> 01:23:35.460]   114.
[01:23:35.460 --> 01:23:36.660]   114.
[01:23:36.660 --> 01:23:38.740]   One collectible for 500.
[01:23:38.740 --> 01:23:41.380]   So go buy that one Leo and sell it on Amazon.
[01:23:41.380 --> 01:23:42.500]   I should.
[01:23:42.500 --> 01:23:43.060]   Look at that.
[01:23:43.060 --> 01:23:45.860]   It's interesting, isn't it?
[01:23:45.860 --> 01:23:48.260]   They are all within a penny of each other.
[01:23:48.260 --> 01:23:51.380]   114, 91, 114, 92, 93...
[01:23:51.380 --> 01:23:54.260]   Well, they also may be the same place that lists in multiple
[01:23:56.100 --> 01:23:56.580]   search engines.
[01:23:56.580 --> 01:23:58.340]   Well, two of them are Base Street Book Companies.
[01:23:58.340 --> 01:24:01.300]   This is the Book purveyors ST Media.
[01:24:01.300 --> 01:24:04.100]   383 dollars books into Manboy.
[01:24:04.100 --> 01:24:06.020]   It's good I got it for 80 bucks when I did.
[01:24:06.020 --> 01:24:09.700]   Well, tomorrow is a book sale.
[01:24:09.700 --> 01:24:12.660]   AAUW, the American Association of
[01:24:12.660 --> 01:24:15.460]   University Women Book Sale here nearby.
[01:24:15.460 --> 01:24:19.540]   And it's a middle school cafeteria that's filled the first day
[01:24:19.540 --> 01:24:20.740]   cost more to get in.
[01:24:20.740 --> 01:24:23.460]   Because the people go in are these people.
[01:24:23.460 --> 01:24:27.300]   And they have scanners and they go rushing around the place
[01:24:27.300 --> 01:24:29.060]   with the scanner and the phone.
[01:24:29.060 --> 01:24:30.900]   And they know the price and they know what to pick up.
[01:24:30.900 --> 01:24:33.620]   And they cherry pick the entire place.
[01:24:33.620 --> 01:24:35.380]   I've watched them in action and it's phenomenal.
[01:24:35.380 --> 01:24:37.620]   And they have lots of rules.
[01:24:37.620 --> 01:24:41.540]   But if they find, let's say, an Oxford University Press Book,
[01:24:41.540 --> 01:24:43.140]   those don't get discounted much.
[01:24:43.140 --> 01:24:47.940]   They pick those up and they look around and they watch them with their,
[01:24:47.940 --> 01:24:51.540]   you know, it's grasshopper and the assistant coming,
[01:24:51.540 --> 01:24:52.980]   learning the tricks of the trade.
[01:24:53.460 --> 01:24:56.980]   And they leave with boxes and boxes and boxes of books,
[01:24:56.980 --> 01:24:59.060]   which in turn end up on Book Finder.
[01:24:59.060 --> 01:25:01.620]   But this is a good thing.
[01:25:01.620 --> 01:25:03.460]   Yes, keeps them going.
[01:25:03.460 --> 01:25:05.060]   This is even, but not even that.
[01:25:05.060 --> 01:25:07.540]   It's, you might say, well, you know, come on, people should be able to make
[01:25:07.540 --> 01:25:08.820]   money arbitrage book prices.
[01:25:08.820 --> 01:25:11.860]   And they're like, no, no, this is moving out demand and supply.
[01:25:11.860 --> 01:25:15.140]   It's getting the perfect market of the perfect market.
[01:25:15.140 --> 01:25:16.660]   It's exactly what it is.
[01:25:16.660 --> 01:25:18.100]   It's exactly how it should work.
[01:25:18.100 --> 01:25:20.420]   So I don't have a problem with that.
[01:25:20.420 --> 01:25:23.220]   Cause otherwise it would have cost you at least $20 to buy that picture.
[01:25:23.220 --> 01:25:24.740]   At least.
[01:25:24.740 --> 01:25:27.140]   I think it only cost you 10 at least.
[01:25:27.140 --> 01:25:29.140]   No, no, these were cheap.
[01:25:29.140 --> 01:25:30.020]   Wait a minute.
[01:25:30.020 --> 01:25:32.020]   Oh, it was so expensive.
[01:25:32.020 --> 01:25:32.900]   Jeff, I'm sorry.
[01:25:32.900 --> 01:25:33.860]   I didn't mean to say that.
[01:25:33.860 --> 01:25:35.860]   Yeah.
[01:25:35.860 --> 01:25:37.460]   Our show today, let's take a little break.
[01:25:37.460 --> 01:25:40.980]   Our show today brought to you by new relic.
[01:25:40.980 --> 01:25:43.140]   You don't want that three AM phone call.
[01:25:43.140 --> 01:25:44.980]   The server's down.
[01:25:44.980 --> 01:25:47.940]   You push something to broken it.
[01:25:47.940 --> 01:25:48.820]   It's not working.
[01:25:48.820 --> 01:25:53.220]   The worst in the world, right?
[01:25:53.220 --> 01:26:01.460]   Because you don't know what's going on with your network or with your cloud or with your production.
[01:26:01.460 --> 01:26:04.420]   I know lots of devs, smart people, developers.
[01:26:04.420 --> 01:26:06.180]   Of course you are your smart people.
[01:26:06.180 --> 01:26:08.500]   You're the first to explore the newest tech.
[01:26:08.500 --> 01:26:10.420]   You actually read the documentation.
[01:26:10.420 --> 01:26:13.220]   You not only want to know how things work, you want to know why.
[01:26:13.220 --> 01:26:18.740]   That's why so many engineers don't like to live in that uncertainty.
[01:26:18.740 --> 01:26:21.140]   That three AM phone call where you don't know what's going on.
[01:26:21.140 --> 01:26:27.140]   They turned a new relic so that they know what's really happening in their software life cycle.
[01:26:27.140 --> 01:26:31.220]   New relic gives you data about what you build, shows you what's really going on.
[01:26:31.220 --> 01:26:33.700]   It's a single place to see the data from your whole stack.
[01:26:33.700 --> 01:26:37.860]   You don't have to launch 16 independent tools.
[01:26:37.860 --> 01:26:42.180]   You got 16 different tools right under the new relic umbrella.
[01:26:42.180 --> 01:26:45.860]   It all is one single pane of glass.
[01:26:45.860 --> 01:26:48.660]   New relic pinpoints issues down to the line of code.
[01:26:49.300 --> 01:26:52.340]   So you know why the problems are happening and you can fix them quickly.
[01:26:52.340 --> 01:26:54.340]   Door dash, GitHub, Epic Games.
[01:26:54.340 --> 01:26:55.620]   They all use new relic.
[01:26:55.620 --> 01:26:58.100]   More than 14,000 other companies.
[01:26:58.100 --> 01:27:01.540]   They use new relic to debug and improve their software.
[01:27:01.540 --> 01:27:06.500]   When teams come together around data, it allows you to try triage problems to be
[01:27:06.500 --> 01:27:10.980]   confident decisions, to reduce the time needed to implement resolutions using data.
[01:27:10.980 --> 01:27:12.500]   Not a guess.
[01:27:12.500 --> 01:27:14.740]   Use the data platform made for the curious.
[01:27:14.740 --> 01:27:16.980]   I hope I piqued your interest and now I'm going to get you.
[01:27:17.700 --> 01:27:20.180]   Because right now you can get it all for free.
[01:27:20.180 --> 01:27:30.340]   Access to the entire new relic stack, 16 useful tools and 100 gigabytes of data per month free.
[01:27:30.340 --> 01:27:33.300]   And not just free for a month, free forever.
[01:27:33.300 --> 01:27:35.460]   You don't even have to give them a credit card.
[01:27:35.460 --> 01:27:39.060]   Why aren't you using new relic?
[01:27:39.060 --> 01:27:46.980]   Sign up at new relic.com/twig any W-R-E-L-I-C new relic.com/twi
[01:27:47.860 --> 01:27:51.380]   G. I think this is just a no brainer.
[01:27:51.380 --> 01:27:53.860]   I don't understand why anybody would operate without it.
[01:27:53.860 --> 01:27:56.100]   Free forever.
[01:27:56.100 --> 01:28:01.700]   New Relic.com/twig we thank New Relic so much for their support.
[01:28:01.700 --> 01:28:12.020]   Of this week in Google, Jeff Jarvis on Buzzmachine.com.
[01:28:12.020 --> 01:28:12.820]   Oh yeah.
[01:28:12.820 --> 01:28:15.380]   And prove it.
[01:28:15.380 --> 01:28:17.220]   Hands-on photography.
[01:28:17.220 --> 01:28:24.900]   Neelai Patel tweets help about this headline from the Verge.
[01:28:24.900 --> 01:28:30.900]   Google meet meets duo meet with me in duo but duo isn't going in to meet.
[01:28:30.900 --> 01:28:35.380]   It's all happening today.
[01:28:35.380 --> 01:28:36.660]   Thank you, Emma Ross.
[01:28:36.660 --> 01:28:37.700]   All done Verge.
[01:28:37.700 --> 01:28:39.220]   Very, very well done.
[01:28:39.220 --> 01:28:42.340]   And we talked about this in our change luck some months ago.
[01:28:42.340 --> 01:28:45.780]   Google announced that it was going to bring the features of Meet into duo.
[01:28:45.780 --> 01:28:48.740]   Technically that began today.
[01:28:48.740 --> 01:28:50.260]   It's not getting rid of the app.
[01:28:50.260 --> 01:28:56.660]   Duo is getting rebranded as Meet with the features from both apps and Meet staying Meet.
[01:28:56.660 --> 01:28:57.060]   Wait a minute.
[01:28:57.060 --> 01:29:01.220]   Let me look at my Google Pixel phone because I should have duo on here, right?
[01:29:01.220 --> 01:29:03.940]   So is it no longer going to say it's duo?
[01:29:03.940 --> 01:29:04.980]   It's going to say it's Meet.
[01:29:04.980 --> 01:29:08.580]   Well, I still see duo.
[01:29:08.580 --> 01:29:09.220]   I still see duo.
[01:29:09.220 --> 01:29:11.620]   And I do not see this.
[01:29:12.260 --> 01:29:13.940]   Duo is getting even better.
[01:29:13.940 --> 01:29:17.460]   Your duo app will become Meet with a new name and icon.
[01:29:17.460 --> 01:29:20.580]   And more features like background effects got it.
[01:29:20.580 --> 01:29:23.300]   So maybe I just need to do an update.
[01:29:23.300 --> 01:29:24.260]   Maybe that's what's wrong.
[01:29:24.260 --> 01:29:25.540]   Maybe I haven't updated today.
[01:29:25.540 --> 01:29:27.220]   Update all.
[01:29:27.220 --> 01:29:28.260]   Let's see what I'm going to get.
[01:29:28.260 --> 01:29:30.020]   Let's see what, what.
[01:29:30.020 --> 01:29:32.420]   Am I getting a new Google duo?
[01:29:32.420 --> 01:29:33.940]   I'm getting-
[01:29:33.940 --> 01:29:35.780]   You got it to a forced update?
[01:29:35.780 --> 01:29:37.700]   Yeah, I just, I just said update.
[01:29:37.700 --> 01:29:39.460]   But I don't know.
[01:29:39.460 --> 01:29:42.340]   Are you sure we're going to change the name again in about three days?
[01:29:42.340 --> 01:29:42.820]   Sure.
[01:29:42.820 --> 01:29:43.860]   You may not want to.
[01:29:43.860 --> 01:29:47.860]   There will be two apps.
[01:29:47.860 --> 01:29:49.380]   There will be Meet Original.
[01:29:49.380 --> 01:29:53.140]   And Meet Diet.
[01:29:53.140 --> 01:29:54.340]   And then the new Coke.
[01:29:54.340 --> 01:29:58.580]   I mean, and the new, and the new Meet that combines Meet and Duo.
[01:29:58.580 --> 01:30:02.580]   The combined app will let you connect both group and one-on-one causes while
[01:30:02.580 --> 01:30:03.220]   as whole meetings.
[01:30:03.220 --> 01:30:06.820]   If you already have duo installed, you won't have to do anything.
[01:30:06.820 --> 01:30:09.060]   Just like me, it will get updated automatically.
[01:30:09.860 --> 01:30:14.980]   Last month, without your knowledge, Google pushed a duo update that added the features
[01:30:14.980 --> 01:30:15.860]   for Meet today.
[01:30:15.860 --> 01:30:19.700]   Google's rolling out an update on iOS and Android that will change the duo logo
[01:30:19.700 --> 01:30:24.020]   to the Meet icon by September.
[01:30:24.020 --> 01:30:24.820]   It doesn't care.
[01:30:24.820 --> 01:30:25.860]   Like we care.
[01:30:25.860 --> 01:30:26.820]   We don't.
[01:30:26.820 --> 01:30:31.540]   By September, anyone who downloads the Google Meet app will receive the new Meet Duo combo.
[01:30:31.540 --> 01:30:37.940]   And if you go to duo.google.com, what do you get?
[01:30:37.940 --> 01:30:38.420]   Let's see.
[01:30:39.140 --> 01:30:40.820]   duo.google.com.
[01:30:40.820 --> 01:30:44.100]   You still get duo, but soon it'll go to Meet.
[01:30:44.100 --> 01:30:46.740]   Okay.
[01:30:46.740 --> 01:30:52.980]   And then also your Google Wallet and Google Pay and Google Cash and Google Change.
[01:30:52.980 --> 01:30:54.980]   Yeah.
[01:30:54.980 --> 01:31:01.140]   Somebody should do a major post-brained together all of their brands.
[01:31:01.140 --> 01:31:01.620]   Sanities.
[01:31:01.620 --> 01:31:02.660]   You just listened to this.
[01:31:02.660 --> 01:31:03.060]   Sanities.
[01:31:03.060 --> 01:31:03.620]   Yeah.
[01:31:03.620 --> 01:31:06.580]   In one full catalog, it'll be hilarious read.
[01:31:07.300 --> 01:31:08.660]   All right.
[01:31:08.660 --> 01:31:11.700]   I mean, they just need leadership.
[01:31:11.700 --> 01:31:17.860]   You know, I want to say I saw one of our articles in here talking about Google leadership
[01:31:17.860 --> 01:31:19.700]   mentioning more focus and.
[01:31:19.700 --> 01:31:19.860]   Oh, yeah.
[01:31:19.860 --> 01:31:25.220]   This is something that all the tech companies are doing doing it.
[01:31:25.220 --> 01:31:30.500]   Productivity and focus must improve.
[01:31:30.500 --> 01:31:34.260]   It's that same one we talked about last week where, you know,
[01:31:34.260 --> 01:31:37.780]   the or the beatings will continue until morale improves.
[01:31:37.780 --> 01:31:40.500]   But they've added something new here.
[01:31:40.500 --> 01:31:41.060]   Yes.
[01:31:41.060 --> 01:31:42.420]   The simplicity sprint.
[01:31:42.420 --> 01:31:44.020]   A simplicity sprint.
[01:31:44.020 --> 01:31:44.580]   Simplicity sprint.
[01:31:44.580 --> 01:31:46.580]   What is pray tell?
[01:31:46.580 --> 01:31:50.180]   A simplicity sprint.
[01:31:50.180 --> 01:31:56.340]   Sundar Pichai and asked to employees today the new effort will simplicity sprint.
[01:31:56.340 --> 01:32:01.700]   Does this sound like a pioneer woman from the 1850s?
[01:32:03.140 --> 01:32:08.100]   Her name was simplicity sprint and she rode the wagon all the way west.
[01:32:08.100 --> 01:32:13.300]   Simplicity sprint will solicit ideas from its more than 174,000 employees.
[01:32:13.300 --> 01:32:15.300]   Well, that's not simple.
[01:32:15.300 --> 01:32:16.260]   That doesn't sprint.
[01:32:16.260 --> 01:32:18.900]   That's not simple at all.
[01:32:18.900 --> 01:32:23.220]   Hey, let's get 174,000 ideas on where to focus and improve efficiency.
[01:32:23.220 --> 01:32:26.820]   Get rid of everything except my job is all it's going to say.
[01:32:26.820 --> 01:32:29.540]   Who's going to go?
[01:32:29.540 --> 01:32:31.780]   I don't like getting rid of his job.
[01:32:31.780 --> 01:32:38.180]   Pichai said Google's productivity as a company isn't where it needs to be given where the head count is
[01:32:38.180 --> 01:32:42.180]   and warned, warned of a toughening economy.
[01:32:42.180 --> 01:32:49.060]   H.R.C. Fiona Chaconi also acknowledged industry wide concerns about layoffs and said the company,
[01:32:49.060 --> 01:32:53.940]   oh, this is good news, is not currently looking to reduce Google's overall workforce,
[01:32:53.940 --> 01:32:59.540]   but we do need to become more efficient and improve employee focus.
[01:33:00.260 --> 01:33:04.580]   And the beatings will continue until morale improves.
[01:33:04.580 --> 01:33:06.900]   It's a nice way of saying you've got to get your ass here.
[01:33:06.900 --> 01:33:09.460]   There's a lot of the lay it offs happening.
[01:33:09.460 --> 01:33:14.340]   Robinhood laid off 25% of its staff.
[01:33:14.340 --> 01:33:17.460]   And by the way, the Robinhood stock went through the roof.
[01:33:17.460 --> 01:33:19.380]   Market loves it.
[01:33:19.380 --> 01:33:22.980]   Amazon is going to shrink by a hundred thousand.
[01:33:22.980 --> 01:33:27.460]   11% growth in Robinhood, 11% in the stock.
[01:33:28.580 --> 01:33:32.820]   Choose because they fired 25, 23% of its staff.
[01:33:32.820 --> 01:33:35.060]   Carvana's lying off 2500.
[01:33:35.060 --> 01:33:37.620]   Coinbase is cutting 18%.
[01:33:37.620 --> 01:33:40.900]   Go puff.
[01:33:40.900 --> 01:33:42.980]   Go puff.
[01:33:42.980 --> 01:33:45.060]   You know, go puff.
[01:33:45.060 --> 01:33:46.660]   Is that one effort to?
[01:33:46.660 --> 01:33:48.500]   It was 10% of his workforce.
[01:33:48.500 --> 01:33:52.020]   Who knew they had 1500 staff members?
[01:33:52.020 --> 01:33:52.500]   What?
[01:33:52.500 --> 01:33:53.220]   Go puff.
[01:33:53.220 --> 01:33:53.700]   What's the 1500?
[01:33:53.700 --> 01:33:54.980]   Who's heard of go puff?
[01:33:55.460 --> 01:33:58.980]   It's alcohol, food, and drinks, and more delivered to you.
[01:33:58.980 --> 01:33:59.940]   Oh, it's a delivery.
[01:33:59.940 --> 01:34:01.460]   It's a go puff.
[01:34:01.460 --> 01:34:03.300]   I know, but I've never heard of it.
[01:34:03.300 --> 01:34:04.740]   That delivered anything to me.
[01:34:04.740 --> 01:34:07.220]   Well, let's see what we can get for you from...
[01:34:07.220 --> 01:34:09.300]   Would you like some buttermilk ranch dressing?
[01:34:09.300 --> 01:34:11.060]   It's only a night ahead since.
[01:34:11.060 --> 01:34:11.860]   Sure.
[01:34:11.860 --> 01:34:13.300]   A blue razz lemonade.
[01:34:13.300 --> 01:34:15.140]   Sorry, it's going to come a little later
[01:34:15.140 --> 01:34:16.500]   because we just laid off our staff.
[01:34:16.500 --> 01:34:18.900]   So easy.
[01:34:18.900 --> 01:34:19.940]   I'll come out to the toilet.
[01:34:19.940 --> 01:34:21.860]   Let's add an address to see delivery time.
[01:34:21.860 --> 01:34:22.900]   Here we go.
[01:34:23.540 --> 01:34:26.020]   1351 Redwood.
[01:34:26.020 --> 01:34:28.500]   I love how this auto fills.
[01:34:28.500 --> 01:34:29.780]   I don't understand how that works.
[01:34:29.780 --> 01:34:31.140]   It's amazing, isn't it?
[01:34:31.140 --> 01:34:32.820]   They just know where you live.
[01:34:32.820 --> 01:34:33.860]   All right, save and finish.
[01:34:33.860 --> 01:34:34.660]   Scrapers.
[01:34:34.660 --> 01:34:36.100]   All right, scrapers?
[01:34:36.100 --> 01:34:37.060]   No, I think they know.
[01:34:37.060 --> 01:34:38.900]   Somehow they know.
[01:34:38.900 --> 01:34:41.460]   It's one of six pack of Corona costs, normally.
[01:34:41.460 --> 01:34:44.980]   12 pack 1799.
[01:34:44.980 --> 01:34:46.340]   I could do some arbitrage here.
[01:34:46.340 --> 01:34:49.140]   I wonder how much it is on an Amazon.
[01:34:49.140 --> 01:34:52.100]   And then I can just have it delivered.
[01:34:52.100 --> 01:34:52.980]   I'll bring it.
[01:34:52.980 --> 01:34:53.780]   One line.
[01:34:53.780 --> 01:34:54.580]   It's a line with it.
[01:34:54.580 --> 01:34:55.700]   79 cents.
[01:34:55.700 --> 01:34:56.260]   One line.
[01:34:56.260 --> 01:34:57.060]   Add that to the bed.
[01:34:57.060 --> 01:34:58.980]   Really, you're going to get one line shipped to you?
[01:34:58.980 --> 01:34:59.540]   One line.
[01:34:59.540 --> 01:35:03.220]   One little line.
[01:35:03.220 --> 01:35:05.940]   I'll do that.
[01:35:05.940 --> 01:35:06.420]   Go puff.
[01:35:06.420 --> 01:35:07.300]   Well, now you know,
[01:35:07.300 --> 01:35:08.420]   white cloth seltzer.
[01:35:08.420 --> 01:35:12.420]   You know, they said they'll tell me delivery times now,
[01:35:12.420 --> 01:35:13.940]   but I put in the address.
[01:35:13.940 --> 01:35:14.740]   It didn't tell me.
[01:35:14.740 --> 01:35:15.780]   So I don't know.
[01:35:15.780 --> 01:35:17.780]   It better be fast because I'm ordering some ice cream.
[01:35:17.780 --> 01:35:19.380]   Halo top cookies and cream.
[01:35:21.540 --> 01:35:23.140]   Three avocados, three 49.
[01:35:23.140 --> 01:35:24.340]   That's a pretty good price, I think.
[01:35:24.340 --> 01:35:27.220]   How much is a gallon of milk in your neck of the woods?
[01:35:27.220 --> 01:35:28.820]   I don't.
[01:35:28.820 --> 01:35:30.420]   I don't like George Bush.
[01:35:30.420 --> 01:35:31.380]   Yeah, no one knows.
[01:35:31.380 --> 01:35:32.420]   I have 49.
[01:35:32.420 --> 01:35:34.580]   This is a half gallon for 599.
[01:35:34.580 --> 01:35:38.180]   So yeah, they probably like adding 50 cents to the, you know,
[01:35:38.180 --> 01:35:40.100]   fruity pebbles.
[01:35:40.100 --> 01:35:43.060]   Three gallon is 549.
[01:35:43.060 --> 01:35:44.260]   That's a half gallon for.
[01:35:44.260 --> 01:35:45.780]   Oh, oh, and so there.
[01:35:45.780 --> 01:35:47.220]   Oh, oh, oh.
[01:35:47.220 --> 01:35:49.300]   All right.
[01:35:49.300 --> 01:35:52.100]   So yeah, I'll buy you on dad gum groceries.
[01:35:52.100 --> 01:35:52.500]   Come on.
[01:35:52.500 --> 01:35:53.860]   No, I'm not doing go puff.
[01:35:53.860 --> 01:35:58.740]   My wife won't let me because it would take me four hours to do what she does in four minutes.
[01:35:58.740 --> 01:35:59.860]   She just goes boom, boom, boom.
[01:35:59.860 --> 01:36:00.820]   She knows where everything is.
[01:36:00.820 --> 01:36:02.820]   I do that too with laundry.
[01:36:02.820 --> 01:36:03.460]   I say, I don't know.
[01:36:03.460 --> 01:36:04.900]   Do the reds go in with the whites?
[01:36:04.900 --> 01:36:05.540]   I can't remember.
[01:36:05.540 --> 01:36:08.660]   And I never have to do one.
[01:36:08.660 --> 01:36:09.540]   That's amazing.
[01:36:09.540 --> 01:36:11.460]   I think don't tell me.
[01:36:11.460 --> 01:36:12.660]   I don't want to know.
[01:36:16.900 --> 01:36:22.020]   If you wanted to buy Pixel Buds Pro, but you didn't want to buy them sound unheard,
[01:36:22.020 --> 01:36:26.900]   you could try them out now in the Google store, but you have to be in New York City.
[01:36:26.900 --> 01:36:28.100]   So Jeff, run on over.
[01:36:28.100 --> 01:36:29.940]   I hope they clean them between you.
[01:36:29.940 --> 01:36:32.900]   I know that was my first thought is I'm not putting that in my ear.
[01:36:32.900 --> 01:36:35.700]   That's been somebody's ear.
[01:36:35.700 --> 01:36:38.420]   The Google store near Chelsea market.
[01:36:38.420 --> 01:36:39.460]   Remember they bought that whole bit.
[01:36:39.460 --> 01:36:39.940]   I've been there.
[01:36:39.940 --> 01:36:40.580]   Yeah, that big.
[01:36:40.580 --> 01:36:42.020]   So now you can.
[01:36:42.020 --> 01:36:43.780]   It's a nice whole store.
[01:36:44.740 --> 01:36:47.460]   There's a little stance is explore Pixel Buds Pro.
[01:36:47.460 --> 01:36:51.060]   Oh, it's kind of like the old booths that you went in the record store.
[01:36:51.060 --> 01:36:52.660]   You're going to a little sound proof booth.
[01:36:52.660 --> 01:36:58.740]   The Google Pixel Buds experience room.
[01:36:58.740 --> 01:37:00.420]   Uh oh.
[01:37:00.420 --> 01:37:03.780]   Now I know where this rumor came from replaced an experience room
[01:37:03.780 --> 01:37:05.220]   centered around Google Stadia.
[01:37:05.220 --> 01:37:10.180]   There was a rumor that Stadia was going away.
[01:37:10.180 --> 01:37:11.380]   Maybe that's where that came from.
[01:37:11.380 --> 01:37:12.660]   Not Stadia, just the room.
[01:37:14.340 --> 01:37:16.260]   Google says Stadia is going to stick around.
[01:37:16.260 --> 01:37:23.540]   Um, I tell you what, I haven't done the change log yet, have I?
[01:37:23.540 --> 01:37:25.220]   No, sir.
[01:37:25.220 --> 01:37:29.460]   Uh, maybe I should also haven't done the TikTok Corner.
[01:37:29.460 --> 01:37:32.180]   I thought we could.
[01:37:32.180 --> 01:37:33.620]   Oh, I thought we could.
[01:37:33.620 --> 01:37:39.220]   We had a user, um, control store, Aneil,
[01:37:39.220 --> 01:37:42.580]   tweeted Jeff Jarvis Leola port for the record.
[01:37:42.580 --> 01:37:44.820]   I love TikTok Corner on Twig.
[01:37:44.820 --> 01:37:45.700]   More please.
[01:37:45.700 --> 01:37:48.180]   I call that popular demand.
[01:37:48.180 --> 01:37:49.780]   I don't care if it's one person on one tweet.
[01:37:49.780 --> 01:37:52.020]   I say that's popular demand.
[01:37:52.020 --> 01:37:52.500]   I know that.
[01:37:52.500 --> 01:37:53.700]   TikTok Corner.
[01:37:53.700 --> 01:37:54.740]   This is a bot.
[01:37:54.740 --> 01:37:55.380]   Don't you think?
[01:37:55.380 --> 01:37:57.700]   No, it's got to be a bot.
[01:37:57.700 --> 01:37:58.420]   He goes real.
[01:37:58.420 --> 01:37:59.460]   Aneil, you're real.
[01:37:59.460 --> 01:37:59.940]   Uh huh.
[01:37:59.940 --> 01:38:00.660]   Tell them you're real.
[01:38:00.660 --> 01:38:03.540]   He lives in the UK.
[01:38:03.540 --> 01:38:05.140]   He has 15 followers.
[01:38:05.140 --> 01:38:06.580]   All right.
[01:38:06.580 --> 01:38:07.780]   Aneil's my friend.
[01:38:07.780 --> 01:38:08.260]   Watch it.
[01:38:08.260 --> 01:38:12.100]   How can you only have 15 followers after being on Twitter for 13 years?
[01:38:12.980 --> 01:38:15.380]   Anyway, it's quite selective.
[01:38:15.380 --> 01:38:18.740]   You who kill your accounts all the time ask that.
[01:38:18.740 --> 01:38:23.380]   So let's do some TikTok, shall we?
[01:38:23.380 --> 01:38:28.740]   First, let's look at the prestigious magazine, The New Yorker,
[01:38:28.740 --> 01:38:36.660]   and their article by Cal Newport, TikTok and the fall of the social media giants.
[01:38:36.660 --> 01:38:38.900]   Which kind of fits what we were saying before.
[01:38:38.900 --> 01:38:41.700]   Oh, yeah, this is yet another article saying,
[01:38:41.700 --> 01:38:43.060]   uh, social's dead.
[01:38:43.060 --> 01:38:45.940]   Uh, it's all about copying TikTok.
[01:38:45.940 --> 01:38:47.380]   Yeah, they all want to make content.
[01:38:47.380 --> 01:38:52.420]   But let me tell you, as a content creator, it's not all it's cracked up to be.
[01:38:52.420 --> 01:38:54.980]   A TikTok music app.
[01:38:54.980 --> 01:38:56.180]   This is the TikTok Corner.
[01:38:56.180 --> 01:38:58.260]   This is, we got to get a, like, forget changelog.
[01:38:58.260 --> 01:38:59.540]   We got TikTok Corner.
[01:38:59.540 --> 01:39:00.980]   A TikTok music app.
[01:39:00.980 --> 01:39:01.780]   Thank you, Aneil.
[01:39:01.780 --> 01:39:02.500]   Thank you, Aneil.
[01:39:02.500 --> 01:39:03.940]   We're at, it's really designed.
[01:39:03.940 --> 01:39:05.780]   Good challenge, Spotify and Apple.
[01:39:05.780 --> 01:39:06.420]   Bite dances.
[01:39:06.420 --> 01:39:07.460]   I'm looking for beer.
[01:39:07.460 --> 01:39:08.900]   I thought I had a beer up here.
[01:39:08.900 --> 01:39:09.540]   For it.
[01:39:09.540 --> 01:39:09.860]   Wait a minute.
[01:39:09.860 --> 01:39:11.220]   I know a place you can order a beer.
[01:39:11.220 --> 01:39:20.020]   you're in order. Get alive. Get a live Annabas one bit by dance but bit but it
[01:39:20.020 --> 01:39:28.740]   filed for a TikTok music trademark last May. You know they have the rights to music in the
[01:39:28.740 --> 01:39:34.580]   US to do amazing slowly expanding that worldwide they launched them in 2020 they launched a music
[01:39:34.580 --> 01:39:41.140]   streaming app in India, Brazil and Indonesia called reso. So, maybe they were testing
[01:39:41.140 --> 01:39:51.940]   it out. What if you aren't got the rights why not? Yeah. Sandwich guy. Remember sandwich guy we
[01:39:51.940 --> 01:39:56.980]   like so much bad story of the sandwich guy last week. He got fired because he was attracted too
[01:39:56.980 --> 01:40:02.900]   much attention. So now he's doing it. Now he's at home. I thought he just sat down and I can't I
[01:40:02.900 --> 01:40:11.380]   didn't know you got fired. Yeah, I get fired. Oh, oh, his account is Donato Decaprio.
[01:40:11.380 --> 01:40:19.780]   Trey. I was famous and now I'm nothing. Now he has. How would you say?
[01:40:19.780 --> 01:40:25.860]   It's a pretty good. He's pretty good. Take it. I like he always the strips that stupid
[01:40:25.860 --> 01:40:30.020]   bread the middle bread out. He throw it away. He ate one of the sausages though. Don't
[01:40:30.020 --> 01:40:38.260]   Oh, oh, little corn con sola cheese. Picante adds a little flavor. You know why people watch this?
[01:40:38.260 --> 01:40:43.460]   Because they think he's going to cut his finger off any minute. He's very sloppy with the knife work.
[01:40:43.460 --> 01:40:52.740]   I love the Italian. He's fun. What's he? He's pretty little pesto. Oh, that's no. Yeah.
[01:40:52.740 --> 01:40:58.180]   That is the thirst inducing sandwich, man. He is no salt. Hank, well, to add a little more
[01:40:58.180 --> 01:41:08.580]   salt to it. Let's put some olives on. Whoa. That actually looks really good. But you're right.
[01:41:08.580 --> 01:41:18.100]   Salt bomb. Notice he doesn't eat them. Ciao, Bella. I love it. I think people would just watch
[01:41:18.100 --> 01:41:25.140]   just because of the Italian, right? Yeah. Here's somebody says, he seems so sad. It's just like
[01:41:25.140 --> 01:41:36.500]   the same. Oh, the nato, the caprio three. It's the bustle of the store is gone now. Yeah.
[01:41:36.500 --> 01:41:43.380]   This is kind of sad. It is. Yeah, it is. You have your 15 minutes and they're over.
[01:41:43.380 --> 01:41:47.940]   You can't believe they're firing him. Gordon Ramsey, judge is cooking. I thought he was killed.
[01:41:47.940 --> 01:41:51.220]   This is no, no, he got fired because he was making a
[01:41:51.220 --> 01:41:56.740]   wow. Caracas. Everybody knows about Gordon Ramsey doing this. He does this all the time. This has
[01:41:56.740 --> 01:42:01.060]   been doing this for you at least a year where he watches on TikTok on TikTok. He's watching
[01:42:01.060 --> 01:42:06.100]   people cook on TikTok. In fact, we had the grumpy guy a few weeks ago. Hank's been trying to get
[01:42:06.100 --> 01:42:10.980]   Gordon Ramsey to comment on his food. It's too good though. Gordon Ramsey can't say anything bad about
[01:42:10.980 --> 01:42:17.220]   it. That's true. It's too good. This is awful. This is a healthy chicken wrap where it's boiled
[01:42:17.220 --> 01:42:24.020]   chicken with mayonnaise on lettuce. Ali Spagnola. I love her. She's great.
[01:42:24.020 --> 01:42:30.340]   Doorstop keyboard, desktop keyboard. I made a keyboard out of spring door stops. Oh,
[01:42:30.340 --> 01:42:32.580]   let's hear what that sounds like.
[01:42:42.420 --> 01:42:48.100]   Okay. Can you name that too? Jeff Jarvis? See the TikTok corner is a nice place to know that too.
[01:42:48.100 --> 01:42:52.340]   No, wait a minute. No, I don't know. No, I don't. Anybody heard on Twitter, so it's good enough.
[01:42:52.340 --> 01:42:56.100]   It's Ozzy Osbourne. You don't know that? Let's do it again. I don't name it one more time.
[01:42:56.100 --> 01:43:00.900]   One more time. You're going to recognize it. I made a keyboard out of spring doorstop.
[01:43:00.900 --> 01:43:09.620]   Okay. Ali, Ali, little tip for you. Never use the TikTok voice. It's also a hate that thing.
[01:43:10.340 --> 01:43:15.380]   Yeah. Hate that. And everybody uses it. I know. It's awful. It's terrible. Ali,
[01:43:15.380 --> 01:43:22.740]   you could say it yourself. It's okay. And yes, who got it? Somebody in the chat room.
[01:43:22.740 --> 01:43:27.060]   Got it. X2. I made a keyboard out of spring doorstop.
[01:43:27.060 --> 01:43:35.220]   Oh, the board.
[01:43:37.780 --> 01:43:44.500]   Crazy. That's how it goes. She also made a toilet out of a chia pet.
[01:43:44.500 --> 01:43:48.500]   I'm sorry. Made a chia pet out of a toilet. That's a very different thing.
[01:43:48.500 --> 01:43:51.860]   She evidently does things to her toilet all the time. She wraps them and does.
[01:43:51.860 --> 01:43:56.500]   I don't think it's. So if you fast forward a little bit, you're going to see the car growing.
[01:43:56.500 --> 01:44:02.740]   Yes. Oh, wow. I hope she has two bathrooms. Oh, my, my.
[01:44:04.340 --> 01:44:09.460]   She's got a whole she now she's doing a mummy. Well, let's watch all that. So are we going to,
[01:44:09.460 --> 01:44:15.380]   is it time lapse? I like, I know it's more than one time lapse. You see it grow. Yeah. All right.
[01:44:15.380 --> 01:44:20.100]   Day one, day two. All right. Let's see. Do you want to see the weirdest chia pet in the
[01:44:20.100 --> 01:44:26.820]   day to watering the world's weirdest chia pet? Chia pet. We already have rooms coming in. This
[01:44:26.820 --> 01:44:32.100]   is awesome. That's her voice. That's her voice. That's her voice. You can see the roots really
[01:44:32.100 --> 01:44:37.380]   coming in now, especially under the bowl. Day four, watering the world's weirdest chia pet.
[01:44:37.380 --> 01:44:43.620]   Do we now have some sprouts coming in? This is awesome. Day five, watering the world's weirdest
[01:44:43.620 --> 01:44:49.380]   chia pet. Day six, growing the world's weirdest chia pet. I am the proud owner of the world's
[01:44:49.380 --> 01:44:54.420]   weirdest chia pet. I covered my chia pet. That's very cute. That's very cute. That's cute. That's
[01:44:54.420 --> 01:44:59.300]   cute. And I like it better. We got one more deadlifts and if you want it, if you want it, I was
[01:44:59.300 --> 01:45:03.380]   giving you a choice here. I didn't expect you to do it all, but hey, Anil, thanks to you,
[01:45:03.380 --> 01:45:10.980]   we have TikTok quarter. Traveling the world with hand luggage only. Live the dash.
[01:45:10.980 --> 01:45:16.180]   So, yeah, it's kind of dumb, but they're trying to go to McDonald's everywhere. It's almost
[01:45:16.180 --> 01:45:21.060]   ridiculous thing you're going to do is to go to McDonald's. Didn't you see if you go to, let's say
[01:45:21.060 --> 01:45:26.260]   McDonald's in Denmark. No. They comment on how McDonald's is different. No, let's not promote that.
[01:45:26.260 --> 01:45:31.540]   Okay. I forget that. It's a terrible right below that Leo was a story of interest to you.
[01:45:31.540 --> 01:45:36.980]   I saw the revenue stream. I should be charging $50,000 to let Jeff on the show.
[01:45:36.980 --> 01:45:40.660]   Yeah, to me for having to put him through tiktok corner.
[01:45:40.660 --> 01:45:45.060]   This is just more of the same way. You know, I've been bemoaning YouTube creators who are
[01:45:45.060 --> 01:45:51.060]   obviously getting paid for their, you know, back scratching little log rolling videos. Well,
[01:45:51.060 --> 01:45:58.180]   apparently this happens in podcasts too. The FTC says it's our general guidance regardless of the
[01:45:58.180 --> 01:46:05.460]   medium. Deception occurs when consumers acting reasonably are misled about the nature or source
[01:46:05.460 --> 01:46:10.740]   and such misleading impressions likely to affect the decision. So, you must disclose
[01:46:10.740 --> 01:46:16.100]   if somebody pays you to be on your podcast and for those who do, it's a lot of money.
[01:46:16.100 --> 01:46:23.860]   If, and by the way, some people charge many a pakayo, the MMA box or charges $15,000 to be on your
[01:46:23.860 --> 01:46:30.020]   podcast. Sorry, Manny. Not interested. Has anybody ever come to you asking? All the time.
[01:46:30.020 --> 01:46:35.780]   All the time. Oh, all the time. A very popular thing. And I'm sure, you know, I told you the other
[01:46:35.780 --> 01:46:44.340]   day I got a somebody C seed like 1500 podcasters and YouTube people and said, Hey, would you like
[01:46:44.340 --> 01:46:50.500]   and the and and I guess some, you know, a lot of them didn't understand that reply would reply
[01:46:50.500 --> 01:46:54.820]   to everybody. So I saw a lot of replies people, youtubers saying, Yeah, sure, pay me, you know,
[01:46:54.820 --> 01:46:59.780]   whatever. And then some guy really getting in on this, he apparently represents youtubers
[01:46:59.780 --> 01:47:06.980]   in negotiations with people who want to pay them for free reviews. I mean, good reviews.
[01:47:06.980 --> 01:47:13.540]   He said, Oh, guys, you're under he's more than $3,000. You're under come see me. So this whole thing
[01:47:13.540 --> 01:47:16.420]   is happening in public because people don't understand reply all, I guess.
[01:47:16.420 --> 01:47:23.140]   And ethics guest guest IO or guestio is a agency
[01:47:23.140 --> 01:47:33.300]   which works with people to pay to be on podcasts. They've they say they paid out more than since
[01:47:33.300 --> 01:47:40.100]   2021 $300,000 to podcasters and guests. It goes both ways like Manny. In just the past six months,
[01:47:40.100 --> 01:47:46.820]   four podcasters on guest IO have made more than $20,000 from appearance fees. One podcast alone
[01:47:46.820 --> 01:47:55.380]   took in more than $50,000. There is no standard price, but Chappelle who runs guest IO says,
[01:47:55.380 --> 01:47:59.860]   we suggest you charge a hundred to $150 per thousand listeners.
[01:47:59.860 --> 01:48:03.540]   How many listeners do we have on this show? How many listeners?
[01:48:04.100 --> 01:48:10.900]   Things around 75,000. So that would be $100 per thousand. That'd be 75 times 100,
[01:48:10.900 --> 01:48:16.900]   75 hundred bucks. That's nothing. We charge by the way, we charge more than that for an advertisement
[01:48:16.900 --> 01:48:24.020]   for an ad. Yeah. And we tell and we tell you there's ads, but a lot of podcasters aren't making any
[01:48:24.020 --> 01:48:32.740]   ad money. So this is here's a here's a one podcaster. He does entrepreneurs on fire,
[01:48:32.740 --> 01:48:40.020]   a daily program. John Lee Dumas, it's hosting creators says he currently charges $3,500 for
[01:48:40.020 --> 01:48:53.540]   an appearance. He raked in $146,000 in June. In June. Good, nice work if you can get it. I,
[01:48:53.540 --> 01:48:57.540]   you know, just disclose. You can do whatever you want as long as you disclose, but you can't just
[01:48:57.540 --> 01:49:03.700]   say, just can't say at the end, Hey, thanks for paying me $50,000. Next, you got to say at the front,
[01:49:03.700 --> 01:49:08.340]   right up front, this is paid podcast, things like that. And when we do an ad, I always say,
[01:49:08.340 --> 01:49:12.500]   thanks to our sponsor, our show today is brought to you by things like, I think that's understood
[01:49:12.500 --> 01:49:17.220]   that they're paying us, right? And you separate out the content. It's like going to conferences
[01:49:17.860 --> 01:49:23.620]   where various speakers get under the program because they're sponsors. Yeah. Which is also
[01:49:23.620 --> 01:49:29.860]   wrong. Yeah. You know, if you say, this is sponsor time, and here's the sponsor talk, fine. I'm
[01:49:29.860 --> 01:49:35.860]   okay with that. It's it's it's it's it's it's all of life marketing now, but I'm actually having fun
[01:49:35.860 --> 01:49:43.140]   with the stuff you added much more that you can see it. Now you can see what you did. We have a
[01:49:43.140 --> 01:49:49.940]   special section for you, Jeff. It's wacky stuff. It's wacky stuff. For instance,
[01:49:49.940 --> 01:50:00.340]   you know, I saw this during I didn't actually add it, but then you did so. All right. A 16 Z,
[01:50:00.340 --> 01:50:07.460]   which is venture capital, that's a VC fund. Isn't that Mark Andreessen? It's Andreessen Horowitz.
[01:50:07.460 --> 01:50:15.620]   Andreessen Horowitz just put $50 million into Gary Vaynerchuk's NFT project V friends.
[01:50:15.620 --> 01:50:22.660]   Yeah. Yeah. And I could have said it better myself. 50. I'm sorry. It's
[01:50:22.660 --> 01:50:29.700]   lit. Million dollars. Yeah. But it had to it. It had. But he does do conferences, which makes money.
[01:50:29.700 --> 01:50:34.020]   You know, I mean, it's stupid about it is you draw some little character and say, Oh, this
[01:50:34.020 --> 01:50:39.140]   character will be everywhere as if you don't as if there isn't a lot of work to make rugrats
[01:50:39.140 --> 01:50:44.820]   characters what they are, right? It's there's more creativity in their stories and this character
[01:50:44.820 --> 01:50:48.740]   development. No, I'm just going to draw this stupid little mouse and I'm going to be rich.
[01:50:48.740 --> 01:50:56.580]   How about Pearson, a big textbook publisher, which who charges hundreds of dollars for many of their
[01:50:56.580 --> 01:51:01.780]   textbooks, right? Yes. But they've decided there's a problem because people are buying textbooks and
[01:51:01.780 --> 01:51:08.100]   then selling them on and they use textbook on book finder, by the way. Yes. And they're not getting
[01:51:08.100 --> 01:51:16.180]   their cut of those. So they're going to use NFTs to lock in their books. So they'll make money on
[01:51:16.180 --> 01:51:23.620]   the second hand sales. The pyramid. Yep. The print edition said this before. Yeah. You know,
[01:51:23.620 --> 01:51:31.540]   the whole NFT thing has just baffled me. Well, you know, and I think you really liked the idea
[01:51:31.540 --> 01:51:38.980]   initially as a creator, right? Yeah. You know, and I know of a couple, couple creators that are in
[01:51:38.980 --> 01:51:45.060]   NFT space and one of them, again, her name is Elise Swope. She's doing really, really well.
[01:51:45.060 --> 01:51:54.660]   And when you see the art that she's creating, I get it. It's not these doodles of a green dragon
[01:51:54.660 --> 01:52:01.300]   on a football field. I mean, she's doing legit, flat out, spending time to create art in it and
[01:52:01.300 --> 01:52:07.780]   it's totally paying her bill. She's absolutely crushing it. But when I see stuff like this from
[01:52:07.780 --> 01:52:14.820]   the big names of Gary V, who's, you know, he has, he's a smart businessman or whatever and just sort
[01:52:14.820 --> 01:52:20.580]   of built himself in the ground up. I get that, but it just seems scammy at this point. Yeah.
[01:52:20.580 --> 01:52:25.860]   Yeah. Taking advantage of people does just, I don't know. You know, and the other thing is that
[01:52:25.860 --> 01:52:37.300]   the, the, the, because for you to support your art in new ways, I'm all for. But what people are
[01:52:37.300 --> 01:52:42.500]   doing with this idea is saying that everything should be owned and that it's, and some people
[01:52:42.500 --> 01:52:48.260]   say that web three is the ownership web, which is, which is going back on the stupidity that was
[01:52:48.260 --> 01:52:54.020]   wrong about copyright. The copyright turned the act of creating art into a tradable asset and it
[01:52:54.020 --> 01:52:58.980]   didn't help the artist. It helped whoever bought it next. And so now they're trying to exploit
[01:52:58.980 --> 01:53:04.420]   everything in this way. And there do need to be more ways to pay you for your art, but in the
[01:53:04.420 --> 01:53:11.620]   end, it doesn't help you. It helps like Gary V. Yeah. Or Kevin Rose or the likes of the NFL or
[01:53:11.620 --> 01:53:17.060]   the NBA. Why the heck could they in the NFT space with? Well, actually, we talked about this on
[01:53:17.060 --> 01:53:23.940]   Sunday and what's, what I didn't realize is that the NFTs, I thought they were being sold directly
[01:53:23.940 --> 01:53:31.700]   by the NBA. That's just NBA licensed to a church. Yeah. The NBA top shots are just licensed to an
[01:53:31.700 --> 01:53:38.420]   NFT company. So the NBA is making some money. You know, well, why not? But really, this is a third,
[01:53:38.420 --> 01:53:42.660]   it's like tops, you know, with a bubblegum company that makes money off basketball or baseball
[01:53:42.660 --> 01:53:49.700]   cards. It's just like that. I love this story, Jeff, that you found somebody decided to
[01:53:49.700 --> 01:53:58.260]   do a Wikipedia deletion report in the style of Hunter S Thompson written by GPT three.
[01:53:58.260 --> 01:54:07.780]   And it's wild. Uh, shall I read a little bit of it? Oh, do you ever bleep yourself for a few cases?
[01:54:07.780 --> 01:54:11.700]   Because it is Hunter S Thompson. Hello, you F some back from the dead. And I'm writing this
[01:54:11.700 --> 01:54:17.780]   month's column. Why? Because I'm the only one who can deal with a sheer volume of BS that gets
[01:54:17.780 --> 01:54:22.980]   deleted from this website every day. It's a damn travesty is what it is. If you're looking for a
[01:54:22.980 --> 01:54:27.620]   sensible boring article on the month's Wikipedia deletion statistics, you've come to the wrong
[01:54:27.620 --> 01:54:33.300]   place. This is gonzo journalism at its finest. This, I can't believe GPT three wrote this. And I
[01:54:33.300 --> 01:54:39.060]   Hunter S Thompson and your guide. Why am I writing this article? Wikipedia has decided that in the
[01:54:39.060 --> 01:54:42.900]   interest of full disclosure, it needs to provide more information about its deletion process.
[01:54:42.900 --> 01:54:48.180]   What better way to do it than to have me Hunter S Thompson right about it. I asked the boss
[01:54:48.180 --> 01:54:52.260]   why they decided to have me write this instead of the normal human editors. He just said that he
[01:54:52.260 --> 01:54:57.060]   did someone with a quote unique perspective. I'm not sure what that means, but I'm pretty sure it's
[01:54:57.060 --> 01:55:06.740]   BS. Anyway, here's the deal. That's pretty good. It's pretty good. I like it. You know, now I'm all
[01:55:06.740 --> 01:55:13.780]   now I'm all for it. If AI could start doing stuff, make it more fun like that. That's good.
[01:55:13.780 --> 01:55:20.100]   All right. Now we do have to do I'm sorry. We do have to do the Google change log.
[01:55:20.100 --> 01:55:32.260]   And Tic Toc Corner doesn't need it doesn't need an intro to make a wonderful or change log needs
[01:55:32.260 --> 01:55:36.420]   trumpets something make exciting. Ladies and gentlemen, you may not have noticed it,
[01:55:36.420 --> 01:55:45.300]   but the good folks at search engine round table did the Google timer has disappeared from search,
[01:55:45.300 --> 01:55:52.980]   but it will be coming back because Danny Sullivan says it's probably a bug. So you know that you
[01:55:52.980 --> 01:55:57.620]   can you know you can do this with Google. You say set timer for five minutes and then it will show
[01:55:57.620 --> 01:56:02.020]   a timer and it'll do it just like you know this has been around since 2013.
[01:56:02.020 --> 01:56:11.220]   Apparently the timer started deleting itself around July 18th. So they asked Danny Sullivan
[01:56:11.220 --> 01:56:18.900]   sentient of search engine land. Yes. What's going on Sullivan tweeted we have an issue we've
[01:56:18.900 --> 01:56:26.820]   been looking into we expect to have it back fairly soon. That was back in July 21st a week later.
[01:56:26.820 --> 01:56:29.140]   The team still checking on it. We're not sure.
[01:56:29.140 --> 01:56:38.820]   And now I guess they say it will be coming back. But meantime you could still use the built-in
[01:56:38.820 --> 01:56:47.940]   metronome on Google search because that's that's still there. Let me see if if I can set it set a
[01:56:47.940 --> 01:56:55.140]   timer for five minutes. By the way, you can see what the how people use this timer because of the
[01:56:56.420 --> 01:57:03.700]   no. It gives me a video. Wow. A YouTube video. Somebody enter prize. Somebody made.
[01:57:03.700 --> 01:57:07.620]   I'll try six minutes now Leo. See if somebody made a six minute. Oh, you bet. Right. This is Adam
[01:57:07.620 --> 01:57:12.820]   Eschborn September 7th 2015. Wait a minute before we do that I would like to see how many views.
[01:57:12.820 --> 01:57:18.820]   This timer has. How many views? How many views? It's a new business for you Leo. That's brilliant.
[01:57:20.020 --> 01:57:26.020]   27.3 million views. 27.
[01:57:26.020 --> 01:57:32.820]   Here's let's do what how many minutes just say any six minutes. Yeah.
[01:57:32.820 --> 01:57:39.620]   No, no, no Danny. I mean, Adam. There it is. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait. There you go.
[01:57:39.620 --> 01:57:45.140]   That's from instruct to beat instruct to beat. Let's see how many see instruct to beats. You know,
[01:57:45.140 --> 01:57:48.340]   there six minutes. Okay. I'm sure that's good. That's that's that's kind of a niche.
[01:57:48.340 --> 01:57:54.660]   It's more niche. Right. Yeah. That's only got 44,000 views. I was in time. Five minutes was the
[01:57:54.660 --> 01:57:59.220]   was the sweet spot. Try 10. Try 10. 10 minute. 10 minute time. Right. Yeah. Because I'll bet people
[01:57:59.220 --> 01:58:06.100]   use this in presentations and conferences. Well, and I bet that once Google took the search away,
[01:58:06.100 --> 01:58:11.300]   these guys were very happy. Yep. Adam did one for 10. Adams again. See, you know, he knows the
[01:58:11.300 --> 01:58:18.420]   market. Let's see. He knows he understands the market. Let's see. 21.8 million views.
[01:58:18.420 --> 01:58:25.860]   Standing. He's got a guy. Wait a minute. He's got subscribers. He's got 146. He's got more
[01:58:25.860 --> 01:58:33.460]   subscribers than we do. Oh, he does. He does other things, but but his big runs are timers.
[01:58:33.460 --> 01:58:36.820]   He's got a whole timers playlist. He's got a 20. Wait, wait, wait, he's got a 15.
[01:58:36.820 --> 01:58:42.660]   Christmas themed 15. All right. Nine. Whoa. Yeah. And one with animals. Do you want one with
[01:58:42.660 --> 01:58:49.220]   seeing nature? Yeah. I could see. You know what? From now on before the show, we're just going
[01:58:49.220 --> 01:58:55.940]   to put that up. Yeah. And you just you'll have seen a consumer video. Yeah. Just just put that
[01:58:55.940 --> 01:58:58.980]   up. Of course, it's a lie because we never start when you say we're going to start. Well,
[01:58:58.980 --> 01:59:04.020]   now we'll have to. Yeah. Now, do you think I'm going to go to take down because I'm showing this
[01:59:04.020 --> 01:59:10.100]   timer? Wouldn't that be I thought it was on sound? Is it on video? Who knows? I don't understand
[01:59:10.100 --> 01:59:17.540]   that stuff. How about an 80s style five minute timer? Oh, my advice feels so Don Johnson.
[01:59:17.540 --> 01:59:21.460]   That that that that that that that that that that that. What?
[01:59:21.460 --> 01:59:26.980]   Yeah. I think you're right, Jeff. I think people like put this up on the screen before
[01:59:26.980 --> 01:59:32.500]   their speeches and stuff like this. This probably does have a legit use. Oh, it's Lindsey does this
[01:59:32.500 --> 01:59:37.460]   a lot for office hours does he just a good general practice point for when you're
[01:59:37.460 --> 01:59:42.660]   on streams. I should do it in class when they realize they're late coming back from the break
[01:59:42.660 --> 01:59:48.580]   the way under the nine minute timer. Here's one of the comments. The legend returns.
[01:59:48.580 --> 01:59:57.780]   Let's just watched it to hear the sound at the end. Let's wave it now. Let's jump ahead and hear
[01:59:57.780 --> 02:00:02.500]   the sound at the end. Let me turn on the sound. This is very exciting. This is what we'll get
[02:00:02.500 --> 02:00:09.700]   you taken down. This is this is very suspenseful in nine seconds eight seven six five. We're going
[02:00:09.700 --> 02:00:23.060]   to hear the the final sound. That that will get us taken down. That will you missed a great
[02:00:23.060 --> 02:00:30.180]   edit. Holy cow. Holy cow. This is the edited show. I got to tell you this whole show is
[02:00:30.180 --> 02:00:36.980]   edit this whole show out. YouTube music can now show other performers performances. So if you are
[02:00:36.980 --> 02:00:44.180]   in fact, let me launch this just to show you. I love this because I like covers, right? So let's
[02:00:44.180 --> 02:00:51.860]   search for a well known song covered a lot. Hallelujah, right? A lot of it. A lot of it, right?
[02:00:51.860 --> 02:00:57.700]   And I'm going to get the Leonard Cohen live in London. Oh, stop. Don't play it. Whatever you do.
[02:00:57.700 --> 02:01:02.660]   Whatever you do. Now there's in this is YouTube music.
[02:01:02.660 --> 02:01:12.820]   Supposedly there's going to be. Well, I don't know. How do I, huh? I guess not. Maybe if I go to the
[02:01:13.540 --> 02:01:29.540]   song. You think this will stop it? I had to do that so that it wouldn't get taken down.
[02:01:29.540 --> 02:01:35.620]   Where is the well? Maybe it's not. I haven't got it yet. Maybe it's not rolled up. But if you like
[02:01:35.620 --> 02:01:41.380]   covers, this will be a very nice feature on YouTube music. It'll show you other versions of the same
[02:01:42.020 --> 02:01:45.380]   song. And I picked Hallelujah because it's probably the most covered song.
[02:01:45.380 --> 02:01:49.860]   It's a very magnificent song. I want to see the movie. Can't wait. It was in
[02:01:49.860 --> 02:01:53.380]   it was in theaters. I got to wait. You know, by the way, that's a feature I want, by the way.
[02:01:53.380 --> 02:01:58.020]   What's that? I want a I'm not going to see it in theaters wait list. Yeah.
[02:01:58.020 --> 02:02:04.820]   So when it comes out, I get a ping that says it's on who? It's on Apple. It's on here. It's on there.
[02:02:04.820 --> 02:02:09.380]   And I'll watch it. I do that. In fact, when I see a movie that I want to see is in theaters,
[02:02:09.380 --> 02:02:13.140]   I get excited because I know there will be something to watch in a month or two. But then I forget.
[02:02:13.140 --> 02:02:18.100]   But then I never. Well, you just all we do. They said I have a ritual practically every
[02:02:18.100 --> 02:02:23.940]   few days we go to Apple on iTunes or whatever it is on Apple TV or the Apple music.
[02:02:23.940 --> 02:02:30.260]   No, I guess it's the Apple TV. We'll go to the movies section and we'll see what's new movies
[02:02:30.260 --> 02:02:34.660]   there. This has a new releases thing. If you just check that religiously, you'll see every time
[02:02:34.660 --> 02:02:38.820]   something comes out. By the way, oh, this is not your own change.
[02:02:38.820 --> 02:02:43.620]   Long, still changing. Hold on. You mentioned this. You mentioned this. You mentioned it's
[02:02:43.620 --> 02:02:48.980]   not one of I do not want to ruin the magic. We're full circling here. YouTube's new tool.
[02:02:48.980 --> 02:02:54.500]   Let's creators turn their own videos into shorts because everything's better like TikTok.
[02:02:54.500 --> 02:03:03.540]   So this hasn't rolled out to my account yet. I tried it earlier. It'll it'll convert your
[02:03:03.540 --> 02:03:08.660]   nice, wide screen to a vertical video under 60 seconds. Great.
[02:03:08.660 --> 02:03:13.940]   New look. How long is that going to last? I mean, people are going to get so sick of this.
[02:03:13.940 --> 02:03:17.940]   Oh, I know. I know. Well, when you make books already video.
[02:03:17.940 --> 02:03:22.100]   Vertical video? No, no, that's the. No, I just think the short the short
[02:03:22.100 --> 02:03:26.820]   talking of the world. I think maybe it's a strategy that everybody ganged up in an antitrust.
[02:03:26.820 --> 02:03:31.380]   They said, let's all get the world sick of TikTok. It's the only way to defeat them.
[02:03:32.580 --> 02:03:36.420]   Maybe all do it. Maybe gmails new.
[02:03:36.420 --> 02:03:41.460]   Look about the fact that most people have sort of attention spans and it's the only way to get to
[02:03:41.460 --> 02:03:46.180]   them. Isn't it ironic that as I'm trying to do the change log and ask the question about short
[02:03:46.180 --> 02:03:55.460]   attention spans. I'm just trying to get through this and please just look at gmails.
[02:03:55.460 --> 02:04:02.420]   Gmails new. Look, it's not rolling out to everybody. Who cares? I got it. I got it.
[02:04:03.060 --> 02:04:08.100]   It's the Google meet meets duo meet with me duo, but duo isn't going to meet. And finally,
[02:04:08.100 --> 02:04:13.060]   I followed I put that in there. And finally, Google Play Store takes aim at annoying game ads,
[02:04:13.060 --> 02:04:21.860]   copycat apps, and misinformation with new rules, which number one very number one rule.
[02:04:21.860 --> 02:04:28.580]   Apps of subscriptions must offer users a way to easily cancel their subscriptions from within the app.
[02:04:29.300 --> 02:04:36.420]   Yes, great. It's actually Apple's secret sauce in their app store because Apple aggregates it
[02:04:36.420 --> 02:04:40.500]   all in your settings. You can see every subscription when it's going to renew, when it's going to
[02:04:40.500 --> 02:04:49.940]   expire. That's so important. Also, requiring by November 1st that all legitimate monitoring apps
[02:04:49.940 --> 02:04:54.980]   use the is monitoring tool flag, which means Google can pop up the thing saying it's monitoring
[02:04:55.620 --> 02:05:02.980]   you all of these policies coming this fall. One of them takes add aim at ads in mobile games,
[02:05:02.980 --> 02:05:10.100]   full screen abs pro adds prohibited. If they can't be closed after 15 seconds,
[02:05:10.100 --> 02:05:16.900]   except there's an exception, which isn't good ads that unlock rewards in a game.
[02:05:16.900 --> 02:05:23.700]   But only if the ad is opt in. So this happens all the time in these free to play games.
[02:05:23.700 --> 02:05:30.340]   Hey, if you'd like 1500 more rings, all you got to do is watch this ad. Anyway, Google will also
[02:05:30.340 --> 02:05:38.420]   prohibit something that can be very painful, unexpected interstitial ads. Ads that appear in
[02:05:38.420 --> 02:05:42.820]   games prior to the loading screamer when starting a new level, man, when games do this to me, I just
[02:05:42.820 --> 02:05:51.380]   delete them. I just delete them. So thank you, Google finally for doing that in the app store.
[02:05:51.380 --> 02:05:57.780]   Wait a minute, somebody's adding. I thought I was done and somebody just added another
[02:05:57.780 --> 02:06:04.420]   way to torture Leo and I was curious. Change log never ends. Did you do that?
[02:06:04.420 --> 02:06:13.940]   Google play and I thought about you. No, you're good at Google Play Store removes version numbers.
[02:06:13.940 --> 02:06:21.140]   What? From Android app listings, that seems like a bad idea. Right. Right. You want to know
[02:06:21.140 --> 02:06:30.420]   what version, although if the version is like this, 11.8.02446165824 dash beta dash arm 64 dash V8a,
[02:06:30.420 --> 02:06:37.460]   which is Google's own version for the Google G board keyboard. That's not so useful, but that
[02:06:37.460 --> 02:06:42.100]   will disappear. But that makes no sense. I want to see the version.
[02:06:42.100 --> 02:06:48.340]   The problem with an app, the support person is going to ask you what version are you on.
[02:06:48.340 --> 02:06:55.140]   Now, nine to five, Google says, Google didn't announce this. Maybe it's a bug. Maybe it's a bug.
[02:06:55.140 --> 02:07:00.180]   But they noticed this with the latest Google app beta. The version number is gone.
[02:07:00.180 --> 02:07:04.180]   It seems like an unusual bug. Seems like maybe that was more.
[02:07:04.180 --> 02:07:08.020]   And that's the Google change.
[02:07:08.020 --> 02:07:13.700]   It was too late. I tried to add another one. You did. Damn it.
[02:07:15.780 --> 02:07:18.580]   I was searching to find anything to put in there.
[02:07:18.580 --> 02:07:21.060]   Just a Chrome one on four significant security.
[02:07:21.060 --> 02:07:24.500]   No, no, it's up here. You guys, you like to torture me.
[02:07:24.500 --> 02:07:28.180]   You like to torture me.
[02:07:28.180 --> 02:07:33.220]   Well played, Ant. Well played, sir. Can I ask for one story from your part of the change?
[02:07:33.220 --> 02:07:35.140]   Well, from the run on? Yes.
[02:07:35.140 --> 02:07:38.020]   Because it just, you know, I missed a lot of stories. Yeah, what?
[02:07:39.060 --> 02:07:46.900]   Is Netflix at line 55 now deciding to sue the Richard and musical people.
[02:07:46.900 --> 02:07:53.140]   Yeah, I put this in here because I thought this was annoying. So George Lucas for a long time was
[02:07:53.140 --> 02:08:00.020]   famously litigious about fanfic. And I think he learned his lesson and decided, no, you know what,
[02:08:00.020 --> 02:08:04.820]   this is really good for the Star Wars franchise to let people create their own legacy. Yeah, knock
[02:08:04.820 --> 02:08:10.340]   offs and stuff. So you remember we talked about it, the Bridgerton musical, which was, was it his
[02:08:10.340 --> 02:08:16.020]   start on TikTok? Yeah. Barlow and Bear, Abigail Barlow and Emily Bear.
[02:08:16.020 --> 02:08:25.220]   They won a Grammy, I might add, for the unofficial, and they even say it in the name,
[02:08:25.220 --> 02:08:31.460]   unofficial, British official musical. They asked to do it and we're told we're not going to
[02:08:31.460 --> 02:08:36.900]   officially say, okay, but we're not going to stop you. So Netflix is now filed a lawsuit
[02:08:36.900 --> 02:08:43.300]   because they did a concert where they sold tickets and Netflix said, whoa, you making money on this?
[02:08:43.300 --> 02:08:48.420]   Well, yeah, they're also promoting this stupid show that nobody should want to watch.
[02:08:48.420 --> 02:08:54.340]   Well, everybody watches it. But that is really dumb. It's really dumb. It's really dumb, Netflix.
[02:08:54.340 --> 02:08:59.380]   People aren't liking you very much these days, Netflix, you know, and they're leaving you and
[02:08:59.380 --> 02:09:07.620]   this attitude is part of the reason. On July 26, not so long ago, the duo staged a sold out
[02:09:07.620 --> 02:09:12.740]   performance at the Kennedy Center in New York featuring the National Symphony Orchestra
[02:09:12.740 --> 02:09:18.900]   and a collection of Broadway guest stars. Okay, maybe Chris, this might be going a little far.
[02:09:18.900 --> 02:09:25.140]   I think you should torture Ant with some of this, right? Tickets range between $29 and $149,
[02:09:25.620 --> 02:09:33.220]   including VIP upgrades. Netflix put its foot down after repeated objections demanding an end
[02:09:33.220 --> 02:09:37.140]   to these for profit before. Okay, you know what? Now my tune has changed a little bit
[02:09:37.140 --> 02:09:41.780]   because that's a big deal. They take their charge and big money for tickets.
[02:09:41.780 --> 02:09:47.940]   Of course, they wrote the music. They wrote the music and it's a tribute to it. And all
[02:09:47.940 --> 02:09:50.580]   they're taking is the characters. They could have done the exact same thing and used for
[02:09:50.580 --> 02:09:55.060]   character names. Sure, it wouldn't be valuable. So, you know, Bridgeton, as a point. Do you think
[02:09:55.060 --> 02:10:03.140]   they'll have a defense? Fair use. Fair use is a parody. It's transformative. Well, yeah,
[02:10:03.140 --> 02:10:08.420]   that's part of what the story says is that there's case law on both sides. As Larry Lessick says,
[02:10:08.420 --> 02:10:15.700]   fair use is just the right to hire a lawyer. And there are some cases where
[02:10:15.700 --> 02:10:20.500]   parody is seen as sufficient and it's transformative and hey, they're making fun of Bridgeton and it's
[02:10:20.500 --> 02:10:26.900]   okay. Or others would say, no, you, you, you, you relied on the value of their brand they created.
[02:10:26.900 --> 02:10:30.660]   All I'm trying to argue here is I think Netflix would have been smart to say,
[02:10:30.660 --> 02:10:36.820]   love it, delighted. Here's the deal. Give us 10% of what do you earn. We'll never sue you. We'll
[02:10:36.820 --> 02:10:43.860]   be happy. And that's that. But no. And I think really it's going to come down to whether a judge
[02:10:43.860 --> 02:10:53.460]   or if it's jury trial, whether a jury believes that this hurts Bridgeton, you know, that it costs
[02:10:53.460 --> 02:10:57.860]   Netflix that people don't watch Bridgeton because of this. That's ridiculous. And I think that the
[02:10:57.860 --> 02:11:05.060]   judge and jury both will think, no, this promotes it, makes you money. It does not hurt you. So,
[02:11:05.060 --> 02:11:09.380]   this is fair use. This is a transformative use of this. And I think any reasonable
[02:11:10.020 --> 02:11:14.740]   judge or jury would feel that way. So, I think we want to also have Ant watch the whole thing and
[02:11:14.740 --> 02:11:22.260]   give us a review. That's what we need. Yeah. Our new theater critic, Ed Prueger. Give me a few
[02:11:22.260 --> 02:11:28.820]   minutes to write in my letter of resignation. You know, this is actually going to end up being a
[02:11:28.820 --> 02:11:38.020]   very interesting story. Warner Brothers made a $90 million movie about Batgirl. Yeah, I heard
[02:11:38.020 --> 02:11:46.740]   about this. Yeah. Big deal starring a well-known actor. In fact, a lot of well-known actors were
[02:11:46.740 --> 02:11:54.820]   in this. Apparently they finished it or all but finished it. But it in the in the sneaks audiences,
[02:11:54.820 --> 02:11:59.460]   I guess, didn't like it. They decided not only were they it was originally made for HBO Max,
[02:11:59.460 --> 02:12:04.100]   not going to release it on streaming. They were never going to ever, ever release it.
[02:12:05.300 --> 02:12:11.380]   And now, of course, a lot of people are saying, but wait, you know, one guy tweeted, I have a
[02:12:11.380 --> 02:12:16.260]   yearly subscription to Premiere Pro. Can I just give it to me? I'll finish the edit.
[02:12:16.260 --> 02:12:22.340]   It was directed by Ms. Marvel's directors, Adil El Arbi and Bilal Phala.
[02:12:22.340 --> 02:12:34.740]   It featured Leslie Grace. It had a lot of big names in this movie. And they finished it.
[02:12:35.300 --> 02:12:38.260]   Spent $90 million going to write it all off.
[02:12:38.260 --> 02:12:44.180]   Also, Scoob Holiday Hunt. They're going to write that one off too.
[02:12:44.180 --> 02:12:51.620]   Which is, I guess, a Scooby-Doo movie. Wow, kind of a shocker. You don't hear about that
[02:12:51.620 --> 02:12:57.940]   happening very often. Do you? Jeff, what do you others? Have you covered the media industry?
[02:12:57.940 --> 02:13:03.300]   Well, there's the most famous one. I put in line 61, some others. The most famous one is Jerry
[02:13:03.300 --> 02:13:10.900]   Lewis's clown in a concentration camp movie. No, there's good reason that was never released.
[02:13:10.900 --> 02:13:16.260]   In fact, Jerry Lewis sued many people to keep it from ever surfacing people who claimed they
[02:13:16.260 --> 02:13:21.540]   had a copy of the movie or of the script. There's Louis C.K. I love you, Daddy.
[02:13:21.540 --> 02:13:25.140]   Well, we know why that got it. We know why that's not. Yeah.
[02:13:25.140 --> 02:13:28.980]   Cobra Gator. I've never heard of that. I think that should have been killed.
[02:13:30.260 --> 02:13:35.540]   Empires of the deep $130 million underwater 3D fantasy star.
[02:13:35.540 --> 02:13:36.980]   Wow. Oh, go go go. Yeah.
[02:13:36.980 --> 02:13:38.500]   Oh, go go. Yeah.
[02:13:38.500 --> 02:13:42.580]   It's Queen of the Mermaids. Blackbird.
[02:13:42.580 --> 02:13:47.540]   Michael Flatley, have Lord of the Dance. Oh, no, this shit guy.
[02:13:47.540 --> 02:13:48.820]   Spy thriller. Oh, my.
[02:13:48.820 --> 02:13:52.900]   What do the Irish dances his way through the movie?
[02:13:56.740 --> 02:14:01.460]   But no, I think this would have done a back. You know what? People want to see it. And I think that,
[02:14:01.460 --> 02:14:08.180]   how bad can it be shot in Glasgow over four months at the start of the year.
[02:14:08.180 --> 02:14:13.700]   According to insiders, the whole thing is so terrible. The studio would rather lock it away
[02:14:13.700 --> 02:14:19.460]   than let anyone see it. And this is a studio that released DC League of Superpets.
[02:14:20.660 --> 02:14:27.540]   Right. The Guardian. So it really has to stink. I suspect somebody, some fans.
[02:14:27.540 --> 02:14:32.180]   I don't know. I just, I can't think this is the last we've seen of that.
[02:14:32.180 --> 02:14:36.580]   Yeah. Yeah.
[02:14:36.580 --> 02:14:38.900]   You're just a cool off. Yeah, maybe.
[02:14:38.900 --> 02:14:43.780]   Wow. I mean, but they had some big names in this movie.
[02:14:46.420 --> 02:14:50.020]   Let me see if I could find the, uh, this, the cast.
[02:14:50.020 --> 02:14:55.620]   The Leslie Grace was in the movie in the Heights.
[02:14:55.620 --> 02:15:04.740]   Michael Keaton was in it, Batman. JK Simmons, Oscar award-winning JK Simmons is a commissioner
[02:15:04.740 --> 02:15:09.860]   Gordon and the villain. And I really wanted to see this was the newly plump Brendan Frazier
[02:15:09.860 --> 02:15:13.780]   as the villain firefly. I really wanted to see that.
[02:15:15.060 --> 02:15:18.100]   Well, have you seen the latest, you know, I'm Brendan Frazier used to be kind of
[02:15:18.100 --> 02:15:27.220]   hunky guy, right? But, you know, like all of us, he's, he's got a little older and, uh, he's not quite
[02:15:27.220 --> 02:15:36.100]   like the guy he was in Tarzan. Uh, so, or George,
[02:15:36.100 --> 02:15:39.300]   well, it happens all of us except Ant. Yeah.
[02:15:39.300 --> 02:15:42.020]   It doesn't happen to him, but yeah. Yeah. I wouldn't go there, but
[02:15:42.580 --> 02:15:46.340]   I'm like, yeah, like leave me out of this old fat man.
[02:15:46.340 --> 02:15:54.420]   I'm quite fine at actually there's another, uh, according to Variety, the real reason taxes.
[02:15:54.420 --> 02:16:01.940]   Uh, taxes. Um, it's just like the, what's the, what's the movie where they, they want to lose money?
[02:16:01.940 --> 02:16:10.420]   Yeah. The producers. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, even before David Zazlav took the reins of the newly formed
[02:16:10.420 --> 02:16:17.940]   Warner Brothers discovery as CEO this spring, uh, he made a no secret of reversing his predecessor's
[02:16:17.940 --> 02:16:23.620]   strategy and committing to releasing first run feature films and theaters. Ah, remember they,
[02:16:23.620 --> 02:16:27.620]   they were putting them on HBO Max, not theaters. Right. Uh huh.
[02:16:27.620 --> 02:16:31.060]   Batgirl, which was going to be direct to streaming.
[02:16:31.060 --> 02:16:39.140]   Uh, spending the money to expand the scope of Batgirl for theaters plus the 30 to 50 million
[02:16:39.140 --> 02:16:44.020]   dollars needed to market it domestically. The tens of millions more needed for a global roll out
[02:16:44.020 --> 02:16:49.460]   could have taken that 90 million dollar investment and doubled it. Yep. Uh, and that's risk.
[02:16:49.460 --> 02:16:57.220]   That's a lot of risk, especially if the movie, uh, ain't great. Wow. But you could just push it out,
[02:16:57.220 --> 02:17:04.260]   you know, on YouTube or something. Uh, all right. That's interesting. That's a little insight into
[02:17:04.260 --> 02:17:13.140]   the movie business. Um, my name, boo, all right. Let's take a break. I think we got everything.
[02:17:13.140 --> 02:17:17.780]   Anything else you want to see? Let me haul, give me a hauler.
[02:17:17.780 --> 02:17:25.220]   We hit quite a bit. We're going to get your picks of the week, gentlemen, in just a little bit.
[02:17:25.220 --> 02:17:31.060]   Our show today brought to you by eight sleep. Oh, I love my eight sleep. Oh,
[02:17:32.500 --> 02:17:38.340]   I love this. Good sleep is the ultimate game changer. My, my, my good friend used to call it
[02:17:38.340 --> 02:17:45.460]   nature's gentle nurse and eight sleep makes a mattress or what we have at home, the pod pro
[02:17:45.460 --> 02:17:50.020]   cover, which go because we like our mattress, goes over our mattress, the ultimate sleep machine.
[02:17:50.020 --> 02:17:53.380]   For a long time, you know, we had electric blanket, worms, you up at night, then we tried
[02:17:53.380 --> 02:17:58.260]   electric mattress pad. I liked that. But the problem is it only went in one direction. Eight
[02:17:58.260 --> 02:18:06.100]   sleep goes up and you can add the pod pro cover to any mattress and start sleeping as cool as 55
[02:18:06.100 --> 02:18:11.220]   degrees. What's the temperature right now? Uh, in beautiful New Jersey, is it almost 100 degrees
[02:18:11.220 --> 02:18:19.060]   when you love when you love to have a nice cool, refreshing bed to get into? And then in the
[02:18:19.060 --> 02:18:26.660]   winter, it can go as high as 110 degrees, but even better, eight sleep, AI automatically monitors
[02:18:26.660 --> 02:18:32.260]   the room temperature. You're tossing and turning how, how you're sleeping and then
[02:18:32.260 --> 02:18:39.380]   modifies the temperature to give you the optimal temperature for what your body needs. It starts
[02:18:39.380 --> 02:18:46.260]   warm generally. This is for me, for sure, starts warm, cools off as you go into a deeper and deeper
[02:18:46.260 --> 02:18:51.380]   sleep. You sleep better with a cool bed and then I have mindset to wake me up in the morning by
[02:18:51.380 --> 02:18:57.700]   gently warming. Clinical data shows eight sleep users experience up to 19% increase in recovery,
[02:18:57.700 --> 02:19:03.860]   up to 32% improvement in sleep quality and up to 34% more deep sleep. Deep sleep is the most
[02:19:03.860 --> 02:19:08.260]   important sleep of all. Cleaning your brain out gets the pryons out of your brain and the deep
[02:19:08.260 --> 02:19:13.220]   sleep is nice up because as it cools you down, you go deeper and deeper. It's great.
[02:19:13.220 --> 02:19:19.860]   Decrease the risk of heart disease, lower blood pressure, even reduce the risk of Alzheimer's.
[02:19:20.900 --> 02:19:25.860]   30% of Americans struggle with sleep. You don't have to. Now, Lisa has a completely different plan.
[02:19:25.860 --> 02:19:30.260]   She likes it warmer than I do, but that's all right because our pod pro cover has two sides.
[02:19:30.260 --> 02:19:35.860]   I have my temperature. She has hers and mine is adjusted automatically as is hers.
[02:19:35.860 --> 02:19:42.100]   Recently, eight sleep launched the next generation of the pod. This is the new one, the pod three,
[02:19:42.100 --> 02:19:47.460]   even more accurate sleep and health tracking double the amount of sensors. And I can look
[02:19:47.460 --> 02:19:53.220]   at the app every morning and see how I slipped and adjust the temperatures or to adjust it for me.
[02:19:53.220 --> 02:20:01.780]   I just love my eight sleep and my pod pro cover. It's not magic, but it sure feels like it.
[02:20:01.780 --> 02:20:10.420]   It's so awesome. I want you to try and go to eightsleep.com/twig. E-I-G-H-T sleep.com/twig.

[02:20:15.300 --> 02:20:21.700]   really appreciate getting in bed and having it be cool and refreshing. It's so amazing. It's so
[02:20:21.700 --> 02:20:26.980]   amazing that it's cool or hot. It depends what the temperature in the room is, what you're looking
[02:20:26.980 --> 02:20:31.860]   for. You'll save $150 to check out on the pod pro cover. You get the new pod three cover. Eight
[02:20:31.860 --> 02:20:37.940]   sleep currently ships within the US, Canada, and UK. And they just added select countries in the EU
[02:20:37.940 --> 02:20:43.300]   and Australia. Yeah, if you've been listening to this and you've been saying, "Oh, I want that
[02:20:43.300 --> 02:20:54.900]   eight sleep." You can eightsleep.com/twig. We are fans. We at least and I love our eight sleep. E-I-G-H-T,
[02:20:54.900 --> 02:21:03.460]   the number eight spelled out sleep.com/twig. T-W-I-G. We thank them so much for supporting this
[02:21:03.460 --> 02:21:08.260]   week in Google and you support us, by the way, as with all our sponsors, by using those special
[02:21:08.260 --> 02:21:19.060]   URLs that way they know you saw it here. Eightsleep.com/twig. I just love it. I'm serious. I love it.
[02:21:19.060 --> 02:21:23.700]   It was Kim and Rose told me about it. And then Amy Webb got one. She loves it. And I said, "All
[02:21:23.700 --> 02:21:28.660]   right, all right, in about eight months ago, we got it and just got us through the winter.
[02:21:28.660 --> 02:21:31.780]   Now it's getting us through the summer." Eightsleep.com/twig.
[02:21:33.540 --> 02:21:41.540]   And let's see here. I don't have a Stacy to pick on, so I guess I'll start with you, Jeff Jarvis.
[02:21:41.540 --> 02:21:51.380]   All right. Well, so before we were on the air, Leo was taking around his Pixel 6 with a new
[02:21:51.380 --> 02:21:59.700]   gizmo. Yeah, I was doing a little tour of the studio. Yeah. The tricaster. And in his tour,
[02:22:00.260 --> 02:22:05.540]   he showed a whiteboard. Yes. And we've had since 2008.
[02:22:05.540 --> 02:22:09.940]   So there's a wonderful little story here from the Boston Globe.
[02:22:09.940 --> 02:22:17.300]   How does that make me not get it? Please do not erase a treasured whiteboard at Boston's Children's
[02:22:17.300 --> 02:22:24.260]   Hospital. And they've left it up kind of like ours for 15 years. We've moved ours twice now.
[02:22:24.260 --> 02:22:28.900]   Wasn't the old cottage than the brick house and now here. Even my signatures on it.
[02:22:28.900 --> 02:22:35.060]   Is it the Boston Globe's Hospital? Yes. It was a doctor who was working on problems,
[02:22:35.060 --> 02:22:40.900]   Judah Folkman, this hospital's former chief of surgery, and pioneer in the field of cancer
[02:22:40.900 --> 02:22:46.500]   research. So he was keeping the whiteboard to keep his thoughts and people would come by and see it.
[02:22:46.500 --> 02:22:52.420]   It was so valued that they put, like yours, they put plexiglass over it now. And it sits there as a,
[02:22:53.220 --> 02:22:59.540]   oh, that's cool. Well, legacy. I have, as you know, a whole bunch of whiteboards here I used when I
[02:22:59.540 --> 02:23:03.540]   when I start when I finished the manuscript for the Gutenberg parenthesis, I finally decided,
[02:23:03.540 --> 02:23:08.020]   because where I do all my thinking, and I had like seven whiteboards where I'd outlined at
[02:23:08.020 --> 02:23:12.020]   different times, different titles, different chapters, all kinds of things. And then I erased
[02:23:12.020 --> 02:23:15.700]   them all. I love whiteboards, but you shouldn't have erased them. You should save them.
[02:23:15.700 --> 02:23:21.140]   My wife would kill me. She would absolutely kill me. That's why we don't have Shakespeare's
[02:23:21.140 --> 02:23:26.340]   wife whiteboards because his wife made it in half the way made it erase them all.
[02:23:26.340 --> 02:23:32.740]   That's right. So I thought that was charming and fitting with the show. The other thing to mention
[02:23:32.740 --> 02:23:38.500]   is that where wolf erotica is now a job. Hey, what? Hey, what?
[02:23:38.500 --> 02:23:46.900]   So if you if you don't want to make your living on on on social media, you don't want to sell
[02:23:46.900 --> 02:23:53.700]   used books, you can write where wolf erotica is that so that's a whole category.
[02:23:53.700 --> 02:23:58.260]   A whole category. People are being hired to, you know, they're outlined and you know what's
[02:23:58.260 --> 02:24:05.700]   going to happen and to and to write this. Yeah. I've got to find somewhere wolf erotica that I can
[02:24:05.700 --> 02:24:11.540]   read right now. I mean, maybe if I just Google, I hate to see your search history.
[02:24:11.540 --> 02:24:22.980]   You guys do it for the show. I take it for the show. Let's see.
[02:24:22.980 --> 02:24:35.540]   Web novels are a $3.7 billion business in China. Vicious entered inside his modernly beautiful room,
[02:24:36.180 --> 02:24:43.940]   which was decorated with chocolaty and white color interior. That is where he saw his beautiful
[02:24:43.940 --> 02:24:51.700]   brunette girlfriend sitting with her back against the headboard of the king sized bed in a sexy,
[02:24:51.700 --> 02:24:59.220]   bright red colored lingerie. The top of the lingerie was barely covering her big bosom.
[02:25:01.700 --> 02:25:07.380]   That that was the old entity. Folks, I can't read the rest of it.
[02:25:07.380 --> 02:25:15.460]   A thin strap was straining against her milky white skin, turning her soft skin in a light shade
[02:25:15.460 --> 02:25:22.900]   of red. And as it tried to hold the cloth together to her back, upon seeing him enter the room,
[02:25:22.900 --> 02:25:29.940]   she straightened and got on her knees and hands on the bed. Obviously, this is not an English
[02:25:29.940 --> 02:25:38.180]   speaker who wrote this. Facing him, giving him a clear view of the valley between her boobs
[02:25:38.180 --> 02:25:44.100]   and what she had to offer. Vicious's lips dried in thirst.
[02:25:44.100 --> 02:25:53.300]   It dried in thirst. His tongue came out to lick the dryness off, but he knew that the thirst she
[02:25:53.300 --> 02:25:59.860]   had ignited in him could only be quenched by, well, you know, GPT three could do a better job.
[02:25:59.860 --> 02:26:03.300]   This I think might have been written by GPT. Yeah, might have been. Yeah.
[02:26:03.300 --> 02:26:12.180]   Wow. Wow. On her knees and hands. This is a just the first paragraphs of taken by the wolves.
[02:26:12.180 --> 02:26:17.460]   And it will soon be a musical that you can watch. Wow.
[02:26:18.500 --> 02:26:24.820]   Good grief. Wow. How about you want to read another one? Oh, you got some of the Diamond Club. Yeah,
[02:26:24.820 --> 02:26:30.820]   no, no, that's there's no werewolves in that. This is called He Takes His Mate, the Alpha's
[02:26:30.820 --> 02:26:38.980]   howl number one, the Pax Alpha claims Jenna. But before he accepts her as his mates,
[02:26:38.980 --> 02:26:46.260]   she must pass a test, a raw primal encounter with his subordinates that sure to leave her sore
[02:26:46.820 --> 02:26:55.300]   and strained and gasping for more. Okay. So you can make money writing this stuff.
[02:26:55.300 --> 02:27:05.060]   Somebody is. Yeah. Apparently. There's workshops, there's apps. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
[02:27:05.060 --> 02:27:12.500]   In China, web novels are a $3.7 billion business. I doubt they have werewolf erotica in China.
[02:27:13.140 --> 02:27:16.500]   Those is from China. Oh, they do. Really?
[02:27:16.500 --> 02:27:21.060]   Look at this. The platform, some backed by Tencent or TikTok's parent by dance.
[02:27:21.060 --> 02:27:22.740]   Okay. You're right.
[02:27:22.740 --> 02:27:31.620]   Dream, good novel, web novel and Fizzo. These are the apps. So you actually get the app
[02:27:31.620 --> 02:27:37.540]   and then you can get the inside the app. They get the werewolf erotica.
[02:27:37.540 --> 02:27:42.500]   I guarantee you people are training GPT-3 to do this right now.
[02:27:42.500 --> 02:27:49.460]   Yeah. Wow. Just remember garbage in garbage out.
[02:27:49.460 --> 02:27:54.580]   Yeah. Oh, yeah. Well, how good werewolf erotica novel are you expecting?
[02:27:54.580 --> 02:28:00.740]   I don't care how good the it is at the out. It's still
[02:28:00.740 --> 02:28:05.940]   an arctic anomaly. So the expectations are low here.
[02:28:06.980 --> 02:28:11.780]   Let us get to Ant-Pruitz. Just got away from this. Much more
[02:28:11.780 --> 02:28:16.820]   salacious picks of the week. How in the heck do I follow that? Good grief.
[02:28:16.820 --> 02:28:20.740]   I want to give a shout out to the party. I saw this.
[02:28:20.740 --> 02:28:24.500]   Hardly. Yes. Hardly. He has beaten my personal best.
[02:28:24.500 --> 02:28:29.220]   This is for a squat. How many plates does he have on there?
[02:28:29.220 --> 02:28:35.380]   That is a total of $455. Whoa, and he spotted it.
[02:28:35.380 --> 02:28:38.900]   He's knee. I love it that there's about eight guys around
[02:28:38.900 --> 02:28:45.380]   watching this in awe and cheering. How does he squat 485 pounds?
[02:28:45.380 --> 02:28:52.020]   He works hard and he has good genes. Oh my God. How much does he weigh?
[02:28:52.020 --> 02:28:58.500]   That's the thing. I told him after that, I need him to slow down just to touch
[02:28:58.500 --> 02:29:01.940]   because he still isn't gaining as much weight as I'd like for him to gain.
[02:29:02.580 --> 02:29:06.420]   And that can be pretty tough on his knees. So I told him I don't want him doing that more than
[02:29:06.420 --> 02:29:11.300]   475. He squats. Well, that's about time.
[02:29:11.300 --> 02:29:14.980]   Until he gets over 200 pounds right now, he's still at about one.
[02:29:14.980 --> 02:29:17.860]   That's amazing. And that is more than your personal best. Wow.
[02:29:17.860 --> 02:29:20.820]   I bet you could bench point that you can though still.
[02:29:20.820 --> 02:29:25.620]   Yeah, I for now, I still can, but he's improved on that as well.
[02:29:25.620 --> 02:29:31.780]   So I think he did 265 yesterday. Now, Lisa told me about this. She kicked in a little bit
[02:29:31.780 --> 02:29:36.020]   and maybe we can get it even a, oh, it looks like you're doing all right.
[02:29:36.020 --> 02:29:39.620]   That's great. Yeah. And then the next thing is last week,
[02:29:39.620 --> 02:29:44.660]   I got it was a pretty good day. And then I got some bad news from the coach of our track team.
[02:29:44.660 --> 02:29:49.220]   The fieldhouse was broken into. So a lot of stuff was stolen.
[02:29:49.220 --> 02:29:52.580]   And I was pretty pissed because he pays for a lot of that stuff.
[02:29:52.580 --> 02:29:57.540]   And I said, are you doing a fundraising? He was like, I don't know how to do that.
[02:29:57.540 --> 02:30:02.100]   And such a nice man. He's been coaching there forever. And I said, well,
[02:30:02.100 --> 02:30:07.460]   I'll start a fundraiser for you. And so I tweeted it out. I said, I want to do this fundraiser to
[02:30:07.460 --> 02:30:14.100]   help coach out. And he needed about a thousand bucks. And dude, we've clearly gotten that thousand
[02:30:14.100 --> 02:30:20.180]   dollars. And I said, I put an update in there. I said, well, I was wanting to mention this
[02:30:20.180 --> 02:30:27.140]   fundraiser on the show to the listeners. But apparently my Twitter feed is,
[02:30:27.860 --> 02:30:33.060]   that's all you needed. It's all you need. So Ant Pruitt.com/help.
[02:30:33.060 --> 02:30:37.460]   I bet you you can use a little bit more, right? You doubled your goal.
[02:30:37.460 --> 02:30:42.500]   The extra could be help because there's always incidentals and stuff that, you know, especially
[02:30:42.500 --> 02:30:46.820]   when they have to travel and maybe they'll buy the team ice cream or something like that.
[02:30:46.820 --> 02:30:51.380]   Stuff like that. So if you want to help, if you got $2, I'd appreciate it.
[02:30:51.380 --> 02:30:58.020]   Just go to Ant Pruitt.com/help. I'm going to keep it up until Sunday. Then I'm going to take it down
[02:30:58.020 --> 02:31:04.020]   and withdraw it and give him the money. So he can very nice. Thank you to everybody who contributed.
[02:31:04.020 --> 02:31:08.580]   And the internet is a nice place. It is. It's a good thing.
[02:31:08.580 --> 02:31:12.100]   Things like this happen because some people like Ant make it happen.
[02:31:12.100 --> 02:31:17.220]   No kidding. I really appreciate that. Lastly, I want to give a shout out to
[02:31:17.220 --> 02:31:25.220]   Ms. Nichel Nichols, the light, Michelle Nichols. There's a video with her speaking about
[02:31:25.220 --> 02:31:28.900]   her meeting Dr. Martin Luther King. This at the seven minute.
[02:31:28.900 --> 02:31:36.980]   Seven. You're ready to hear it? Yes. Of course, Lieutenant Ahura from Star Trek.
[02:31:37.700 --> 02:31:42.500]   Just looked at him. He said, "For the first time on television,
[02:31:42.500 --> 02:31:54.980]   we will be seen as we should be seen every day as intelligent, quality, beautiful
[02:31:54.980 --> 02:32:03.060]   people who can sing, dance, but who can go into space, who can be lawyers, who can be
[02:32:03.860 --> 02:32:10.740]   teachers, who can be professors, who are in this day. And yet you don't see it on television until now."
[02:32:10.740 --> 02:32:20.980]   And he went on so many of the things, perhaps some of the things he said.
[02:32:20.980 --> 02:32:25.220]   But I could say nothing. She wanted to quit. She felt it was an
[02:32:25.220 --> 02:32:28.900]   undigified role. She was a Broadway performer. She wanted to go back to Broadway.
[02:32:29.620 --> 02:32:35.700]   But Dr. King said, "No." As you can hear, she said, "No. We need to show that we can go into
[02:32:35.700 --> 02:32:40.820]   space that we'll be there in the future." And I think that's absolutely true. She did it with
[02:32:40.820 --> 02:32:46.900]   such a big point. Such a great message. It would have been nice to have an even bigger role for her
[02:32:46.900 --> 02:32:53.620]   on Star Trek. And you know what's great is that the new Strange New World's Star Trek,
[02:32:53.620 --> 02:32:59.700]   Lieutenant O'Hara, does have a much larger role. That's great. They kind of give it to
[02:32:59.700 --> 02:33:05.780]   more to do, which is fantastic. The young, pardon me? She's a cadet. She's a cadet. That's right.
[02:33:05.780 --> 02:33:12.900]   This is early days. It's a prequel. Yeah. And the young Spock and Captain Kirk's brother
[02:33:12.900 --> 02:33:21.300]   is on the Enterprise as well, along with Captain Pike. Very nice. That's really nice. I knew that
[02:33:21.300 --> 02:33:24.980]   that story, but I hadn't seen her talking about it. So it's really nice to have that video.
[02:33:24.980 --> 02:33:30.420]   Yeah. One of our listeners sent that to me because I mentioned it on Twitter and one of our
[02:33:30.420 --> 02:33:34.820]   listeners sent that. I was like, "Yeah, this is the one." Yeah. From metvlegends.org,
[02:33:34.820 --> 02:33:42.260]   archive of American television. Michelle Nichols talking about why she stuck around
[02:33:42.260 --> 02:33:48.500]   on Star Trek. Thank you, Aunt Pruitt. Hands-on photography. What's coming up on HOP?
[02:33:50.580 --> 02:33:55.540]   Well, this week I'm going to talk about Instagram a little bit, but I'm not going to rant and
[02:33:55.540 --> 02:33:59.940]   yell or anything like that. Just going to talk about Instagram a little bit. So make sure you
[02:33:59.940 --> 02:34:09.780]   tune in to it.tv/hop. And Aunt is very busy also as manager of our club twit community. You do such a
[02:34:09.780 --> 02:34:14.900]   good job coming up August 18th, Alex Lindsey from Macbreak Weekly with an aspect. Yeah.
[02:34:14.900 --> 02:34:19.060]   Yeah. That'll be a bit scheduled. Yeah. And then our book club. And by the way,
[02:34:19.060 --> 02:34:25.140]   you could join us too, Jeff. I decided to kick in because we did termination shock last
[02:34:25.140 --> 02:34:29.380]   last time. It was so much fun. I'm going to come back for this one. Stacy's book club with
[02:34:29.380 --> 02:34:34.340]   Aunt Pruitt, Stacy Higginbotham. I'll be there. You should be there too. Clara and the Sun is our book
[02:34:34.340 --> 02:34:40.980]   by Nobel Prize winning author Ishiguru. I don't know how to say it tonight.
[02:34:40.980 --> 02:34:46.820]   Yeah. I think it's Ishiguru. It's a really great book. I'm really enjoying it. And it'll be a lot of
[02:34:46.820 --> 02:34:51.540]   fun to talk about it. That's coming up August 25th. If you're not member of club twit, you should be.
[02:34:51.540 --> 02:34:58.100]   I know. And if you don't... I want to say something. Last week, we had our members fireside chat
[02:34:58.100 --> 02:35:05.940]   where I randomly picked out some club twit members. And I've gotten some really great feedback about
[02:35:05.940 --> 02:35:14.420]   that. And joined the club, y'all. That was so much fun to get to know these three members even more.
[02:35:14.420 --> 02:35:19.940]   And we just had candid conversation on it Thursday morning here in California. It's just totally
[02:35:19.940 --> 02:35:26.420]   worth the seven bucks a month. Yeah. Yeah. I agree. You get ad-free versions of all the show. We thought
[02:35:26.420 --> 02:35:31.780]   that would be the big selling point. You don't have any ads, which means no tracking. Turns out
[02:35:31.780 --> 02:35:37.140]   this Discord is really one of those sweet spots here. You're doing a great job with it. I love hanging
[02:35:37.140 --> 02:35:43.540]   out in there. Every show has a Discord chat going during the show. This is the one for Twig. It's on
[02:35:43.540 --> 02:35:55.060]   right now. But we also have conversations about a lot of other geeky topics. So it's not just the
[02:35:55.060 --> 02:36:01.540]   shows. We've got people talking about autos and books and coding and hacking and ham radio and
[02:36:01.540 --> 02:36:07.140]   philosophy and sci-fi and sports and space. And we even had a Twig Cruise channel in there.
[02:36:07.140 --> 02:36:13.220]   As we were talking about earlier, Discord has become, for many of us, the preferred social
[02:36:13.220 --> 02:36:19.300]   network. Because you make it of the people you care about. You want to be part of. And if the
[02:36:19.300 --> 02:36:24.500]   Twig family is, and I think it's a wonderful family, is maybe the people you'd like to hang out with,
[02:36:24.500 --> 02:36:28.340]   you should check out Club Twit. There's also a Twit Plus feed. There are shows we do in Club
[02:36:28.340 --> 02:36:34.100]   Twit that we don't yet offer publicly. As they grow and build an audience, we will, among them,
[02:36:34.100 --> 02:36:40.660]   the brand new hands-on windows, Paul Therat's Windows Show, which is now only episode one. It's
[02:36:40.660 --> 02:36:47.460]   just starting. There's the untitled Linux Show, Stacey's Book Club, the Gizfiz, more content coming
[02:36:47.460 --> 02:36:52.580]   all the time. Because that's how we launched this week in space. We launched it for the club first.
[02:36:52.580 --> 02:36:56.820]   And then as it grew and as I said, we could get advertisers. We were able to make it
[02:36:56.820 --> 02:37:01.460]   every available for everybody. So members of the club really are supporting what we're doing
[02:37:01.460 --> 02:37:06.820]   to grow Twit. So Tik-Tok Corner? We could have a Tik-Tok Corner if you want.
[02:37:06.820 --> 02:37:15.540]   Or a Gutenberg Show? You want a Gutenberg Show? We'll do a Google or torture aunt with musicals?
[02:37:15.540 --> 02:37:22.580]   There we go. That's musicals for aunt to listen to. This is aunt saying, "I'm in charge of the club."
[02:37:22.580 --> 02:37:27.220]   It's not an democracy, Jarvis. It's not happening. Seven dollars a month.
[02:37:27.220 --> 02:37:35.780]   Two more things real quick, sir. Yes. This week, I was on the untitled Linux Show with Mr. Jonathan
[02:37:35.780 --> 02:37:42.100]   and Jeff. It was a lot of fun. It's a great show. Not that Linux Nerd is as you are or any of our
[02:37:42.100 --> 02:37:48.020]   other listeners. But it was a lot of fun. And that's only available in Club Twit. And secondly,
[02:37:48.020 --> 02:37:55.940]   Mr. Jarvis, I really need to get you and Mr. Doc Serals together. Oh, that would be a great event.
[02:37:55.940 --> 02:38:01.860]   Doc's in my worship. Yeah, I think that's a great idea. Yeah, I'm all for that.
[02:38:01.860 --> 02:38:07.220]   You know what might be fun too is if we could get his co-author from... Oh, David Train. Yeah.
[02:38:07.220 --> 02:38:11.700]   David Weinberg. Yeah. He's a dear friend and a wonderful guy. I'd love to see the two of them
[02:38:11.700 --> 02:38:18.580]   interact from the old days. Oh, we should do. And if we do that, I will do a reading of the
[02:38:18.580 --> 02:38:24.180]   Clue Train Manifesto. We could just put it in a chapter a day for a couple of weeks. It'd be
[02:38:24.180 --> 02:38:30.900]   really fun. It has the best opening nurbs ever. Yeah, I would love to do that. Anyway,
[02:38:30.900 --> 02:38:36.900]   if you're interested in Club Twit, Twit.tv/ClubTwit. Every ClubTwit show or ad-free versions of the
[02:38:36.900 --> 02:38:41.140]   shows are also, they're all available individually. If you only want that show, for instance, hands
[02:38:41.140 --> 02:38:46.340]   on Windows for $2.99, but all of that's at Twit.tv/ClubTwit. There's also yearly and corporate
[02:38:46.340 --> 02:38:53.460]   memberships. Twit.tv/ClubTwit. Mr. Jeff Jarvis is the director of the Town Knight Center for
[02:38:53.460 --> 02:39:01.300]   Entrepreneurial Journalism at the Grig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the City
[02:39:01.300 --> 02:39:07.700]   University of New York. Thank you, Jeff Jarvis. Thank you, gentlemen. It was fun night. Buzzmachine.com.
[02:39:07.700 --> 02:39:14.180]   I'll come over this is. Yeah, we don't need a whole lot of people to do this show. Just the three of us.
[02:39:14.180 --> 02:39:21.940]   We do Twig and I'm hoping Stacy will be back next week. I think it was like there was a
[02:39:21.940 --> 02:39:25.940]   scheduling conflict. I think she's not ill. She was just scheduling conflict or something.
[02:39:25.940 --> 02:39:27.860]   Yeah. She had a driver to get somewhere. She's got a lot going on.
[02:39:27.860 --> 02:39:35.220]   But I think she'll be back next week if God willing, if the Creek's good. Let's see. What is it?
[02:39:35.220 --> 02:39:38.900]   If the good Lord willing, then the Creek's don't rise. Lord willing and the Creek don't rise.
[02:39:38.900 --> 02:39:43.940]   Stacy Mc I'm going to walk the way back. So it says my grandmother. I love it. The good Lord willing
[02:39:43.940 --> 02:39:52.820]   the Creek don't rise. Stacy, Jeff and aunt next week make a date 2 p.m. Pacific 5 p.m. Eastern
[02:39:52.820 --> 02:39:59.540]   2100 UTC live.twit.tv has a live audio or video stream. We also have a great chat room open to all
[02:39:59.540 --> 02:40:06.260]   irc.twit.tv. You can get the shows afterwards by going to the website twit.tv/twig. There's a
[02:40:06.260 --> 02:40:10.980]   YouTube channel of course for this week in Google. We also of course offer it as a podcast, which
[02:40:10.980 --> 02:40:15.220]   means you can subscribe in your favorite podcast player and get it automatically the minute it's
[02:40:15.220 --> 02:40:20.020]   available. If you are a person listening after the fact and you want to join the conversation,
[02:40:20.020 --> 02:40:25.940]   you say, well, the chats are all live. Don't worry. We have a fabulous forum at twit.community
[02:40:25.940 --> 02:40:33.380]   that's open to all. And it's a really great place to hang. We also have, yep, and we all and
[02:40:33.380 --> 02:40:41.460]   I know aunt you're in there all the time. And we also have twit.social, which is our mastodon instance.
[02:40:41.460 --> 02:40:49.380]   And that's a great conversation. Really great conversation. So all of the both of those are free
[02:40:49.380 --> 02:40:55.060]   and I do have to approve you because we want to keep the spammers out. But stop by twit.social
[02:40:55.060 --> 02:41:01.700]   or twit.community or both. And tell me which show you like the best because spammers, it's so funny
[02:41:01.700 --> 02:41:06.420]   in fact, I should just see if I have some people trying to get in because spammers for some reason
[02:41:06.420 --> 02:41:16.660]   they don't make much effort to hide their spammingness. So both of these are okay. I'm going to add
[02:41:16.660 --> 02:41:21.700]   both of them. One's Dan Patterson who was on Sunday. So thank you, Dan. And another one.
[02:41:21.700 --> 02:41:27.460]   Social. Yeah. But occasionally it'll be like to tell people about my cryptocurrency scam.
[02:41:29.300 --> 02:41:36.180]   At least they're honest, right? But I don't approve them. I'm sorry. Twit.social, twit.community.
[02:41:36.180 --> 02:41:40.260]   Thank you everybody for being here. Have a wonderful week. We'll see you next time
