[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   It's time for Twig this week in Google.
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   Jeff Stacey and that.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   They're all here. We got lots to talk about.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Alphabet's amazing quarter.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   And what it all means.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   Google's getting in bed with Ford.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   What does that mean?
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   Jeff Bezos steps down at Amazon.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   Steven Sinowski steps up.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   It's all coming up next on Twig.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   It's the last few days for our annual Twit survey.

[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   It's time for Twig.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   This week in Google.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   My favorite show on a Wednesday afternoon.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   [laughter]
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   I really had a narrow that guy.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   My favorite middle child.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   I don't want the other guys to be jealous.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   I do like doing this show an awful lot.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   And it's partly because of you, Jeff Jarvis, the townite center professor of the thing
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   of the jig from the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the City University
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   of Newark.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   Hello?
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   Newark.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   Newark.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   Hello.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   Hello.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   And it's partly because of Stacey Higginbotham from Stacey.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   It's mostly because of Stacey.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   Well, yes.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   Jeff's room is reversed.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   Wait a minute.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   It is.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   Wait a minute.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   What the hell happened here?
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   Sorry.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   It is because I was on Star Talk earlier and I had to debunk filter bubbles and I wanted to show
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   the book.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   Did I mess that up?
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   I did, didn't I?
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   I think the book is now backwards.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   Oh shoot.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   Oh no, no, wait a second.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   I, no, I reversed.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   Oh my God, Stacey, I can't believe you noticed it.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   How could you not miss it?
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   There you go.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   The French doors are on the left.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   I didn't pay attention to them.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   I completely missed it.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   When stores were there.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   Holy cow, Stacey, you would be really good at it.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   You're observant.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   What is that?
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   I'm a reporter.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   That's my job.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   That's a special skill.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   That's for like, I spy with my little eye.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   I was about to say like newspaper comic pages.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   Yes, yes.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   I like to make a team.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   Yes, exactly.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   Highlights for children.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   A useful skill.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   You're very good at that.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   Anyway, welcome from Stacey on IOT, the Stacey on IOT newsletter at Stacey on IOT.com and of
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   course the podcast Stacey on IOT.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   And it's also because of this fella here at Pruitt.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   Yay!
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   Friends on photography at T.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   I don't know if I would have called that observant.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   Where I'm from, we call it a nosy.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   Oh!
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   Oh!
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   Bless your heart.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   Just kidding.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   I just was called nosy by aunt.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   I mean that's just teasing.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   That hurts me in my heart.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   You know, there is a little something and you two probably get it because Stacey, you're
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   from Houston and ants from South Carolina and you probably get it because, but there is a
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   little kind of passive aggressive thing going on in the south.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   It's the bless your heart thing, right?
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   It's nice, but it's really a little bit of a thrown little shade.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   Oh, whoa.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   It's accepted at you a couple times.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   I know you have.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   I know you have.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   I don't think I didn't miss it.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   They're constantly nice and rude.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   I'll call that, I'll send to myself for John's sake, but I call that Grinn Effing.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   Grinn Effing.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   It's not quite so, I feel like it depends.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   It's soft.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   Harsh?
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   There's also like, we noticed that you were not meeting our standards, which is just kind
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   of like, let's say you brought a grocery store pie to the picnic.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   You know, she brought a grocery store pie to the picnic.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   Bless her heart.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   Do you not have enough time?
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   Are you rushed this morning?
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   But now see Jeff's from New Jersey and in Jersey, it would be what the hell you're
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   getting.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   How you doing?
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   You're doing it up by.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   You think this is?
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   Different vibe.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   Hold it for five.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.800]   I just realized, Leo, that the lower third and the lighting behind you is the same blue
[00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:51.000]   as the new Mustang.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   Grabber blue.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.520]   So Jeff's giving me a hard time because I was very excited while I'm doing Windows weekly
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:59.520]   in the other studio.
[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:05.720]   I have it at window outside and I'm looking outside and I see what I'm pretty sure is a
[00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:10.720]   Mustang Mach-E, the new electric vehicle, go by and grabber blue and it kind of really
[00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:13.160]   grabbed me because I'm waiting for mine.
[00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:17.720]   So I immediately, after Windows weekly, ran across the street, took this picture.
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:22.720]   He has threatened people that if the car comes in while he's on the show, he's gone.
[00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:24.440]   It's our show then.
[00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:26.480]   You know, though, it's one of those things.
[00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.080]   Life is so disappointing.
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:31.360]   I'm sure you all understand this.
[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:32.360]   Where the anticipation...
[00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:33.360]   Oh, no, no.
[00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:38.440]   Well, tell me, you tell me the anticipation of getting it far outweighs.
[00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:42.440]   You know, the minute I get in and I drive off, it's like, "That's just a car."
[00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:43.440]   Right?
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:46.360]   No, when I got my Tesla, I loved that thing for...
[00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:47.360]   I still love it.
[00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:48.360]   Oh, okay.
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:49.360]   I can't say that.
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:50.360]   Okay.
[00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:54.600]   Anticipation is great, but depends on what the anticipation is for, you know, because something
[00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.320]   is just...
[00:06:56.320 --> 00:07:00.520]   I still enjoy sitting right here and hitting these buttons to turn on the camera and it
[00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:01.520]   did...
[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:02.520]   Yeah, I'm not saying that.
[00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:08.200]   You know, I always enjoy travel, but I have to say that often the case, the planning,
[00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:14.040]   the anticipation, the leading right up to the trip is a lot of the excitement.
[00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:17.000]   Once you're on the trip, it's just you're living your life.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.400]   I haven't loved a car since my sob in 1990.
[00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:23.520]   Did it make you cry?
[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:27.720]   Or just sob?
[00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:29.520]   Your weekend's coming up, Oleo.
[00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:31.520]   Oh, jammer B, where's the room shot?
[00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:32.520]   There is a tie in.
[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:37.960]   There is a tie in because Ford and Google announced this week they've signed a six-year
[00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:44.560]   deal for connectivity in the car and cloud services.
[00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:50.520]   Ford did not say which vehicles this will include and I have a feeling that the Mach-E,
[00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:56.360]   which is new, is not quite new enough to take advantage of this.
[00:07:56.360 --> 00:08:03.240]   It's designed according to CNBC to streamline Ford's operations and accelerate their $11
[00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:06.040]   billion restructuring plan.
[00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:09.400]   You know, Ford has for the longest time used QNX.
[00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:13.440]   Before that it used Microsoft Car as their operating system.
[00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:18.240]   It's not clear whether they'll use Android.
[00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:22.000]   There's a Google version of Android for automobiles.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.440]   I'm not sure that's exactly what's going to happen.
[00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:31.520]   Under the deal, CNBC says Ford and Lincoln vehicles will support Android, the Google
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:33.320]   Assistant, Google Maps and Google Play.
[00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:40.120]   This starts in two years in 2023 and they'll use Google's cloud for other types of services
[00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:45.920]   as an example for enabling a system for sending customer messages about maintenance or trade
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:47.840]   and opportunities.
[00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:54.000]   Google will also help Ford use artificial intelligence in areas like supply chain
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   logistics and manufacturing.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.040]   So this is a big tie up.
[00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:58.040]   Go ahead Stacy.
[00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:03.640]   Well, I was going to check and make sure because the first thing my husband was like, so I
[00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:05.840]   have to have a Google phone to drive a Ford car.
[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:06.840]   No.
[00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:11.440]   But this has nothing to do with like what you're going to plug your phone into it.
[00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:12.440]   Yeah, Ford.
[00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:13.440]   Maps or whatever.
[00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:14.360]   Ford specifically addressed this.
[00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:17.240]   It will still, well, that's a question.
[00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:22.600]   It will still support both Android Auto and Apple's CarPlay while driving.
[00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:27.360]   So they said they're not going to abandon that.
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:29.680]   But I think it is replacing sync.
[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:34.520]   The Mustang I'm getting has Ford's latest version of sync, which is kind of their UI
[00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:39.280]   on top of, I think it's Q and X, whatever real-time operating system they're using.
[00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:44.040]   As I said, for a long time it was Microsoft's platform with Ford's sync on top of it.
[00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:48.040]   So I'm not sure when or how this is going to happen.
[00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:52.840]   Yeah, years ago the company used Microsoft software to power its sync in-car communication
[00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:58.800]   system, but they switched to Q and X, which is from Blackberry of all people in 2014.
[00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:05.920]   In 2015, they committed to using Azure, Microsoft's cloud for software updates, and they signed
[00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:09.080]   a multi-year deal with Amazon Web Services in 2019.
[00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:11.560]   So unclear if those relationships--
[00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:12.560]   Try it, everybody.
[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:14.160]   Yeah, they've gone through everybody.
[00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:15.160]   Exactly.
[00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:20.080]   Interesting, I think it's interesting from both companies.
[00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:24.640]   It sounds like a bigger relationship than either of those.
[00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:29.600]   Well, it sounds like they're trying to solidify or consolidate everything from their backend
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:38.960]   cloud stuff for the cars into the user experience stuff on the cars and then the underlying.
[00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:41.800]   Q and X is embedded.
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:47.560]   I guess, yes, you could use Android, but most people chose Q and X because it is a true
[00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:55.080]   real-time operating system and it's got a lot of security benefits that Android, frankly,
[00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:56.440]   I don't really feel like it has.
[00:10:56.440 --> 00:11:00.680]   So that's a question I have on that, just from an IOT perspective.
[00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:05.200]   Yeah, so Android Auto is like CarPlay.
[00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:11.600]   It's a user interface glossed on top of the screen that interfaces with your phone.
[00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:17.800]   There is also Android for Cars, which is an Android Automotive OS.
[00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:23.160]   And it's not-- I don't know if that's what Ford-- they didn't use that phrase, Android
[00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:24.680]   Automotive OS.
[00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:28.920]   Not clear what the relationship is going to be around that.
[00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:32.200]   You have-- on a Tesla-- it's one of the interesting things about Tesla.
[00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:33.360]   They do it all.
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:35.160]   They don't use anybody else's operating system.
[00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:36.720]   It's Linux.
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:39.000]   They do all the software on top of it.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.880]   They don't even integrate very well with third-party services.
[00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:46.040]   There's no CarPlay or Android Auto.
[00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:47.040]   There's no Apple music.
[00:11:47.040 --> 00:11:48.280]   You just got Spotify like a year ago.
[00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:50.120]   You just got Spotify.
[00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:53.680]   So it's more of a closed universe.
[00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:57.840]   And I have to say, the cars that I've driven that have Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, it's
[00:11:57.840 --> 00:12:00.960]   great because your phone is always updated.
[00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:05.040]   Those maps are much more recent than any map that's built into a car.
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:07.640]   So although for a while, I didn't--
[00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:08.640]   But this sounds a lot like something else.
[00:12:08.640 --> 00:12:14.680]   It's mostly used in no one will even notice, though, with it being the OS of the car.
[00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:16.120]   You know, a lot of people don't really know it.
[00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:17.120]   No, they don't care.
[00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:18.120]   All of that stuff.
[00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:22.800]   Oh, ScooterX is saying, yes, this is the quote, "By leveraging Android Automotive, Ford
[00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:27.280]   will also be able to divert significant software engineering talent from operating system development
[00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:30.400]   to the creation of Ford and Lincoln customer innovations."
[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:34.160]   So it sounds like they are replacing QNX and Sync with the--
[00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:35.160]   And they're out.
[00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:37.880]   They're basically out-swacing the operating system.
[00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:38.880]   Right.
[00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:40.840]   And all of the underlying software and focusing on it.
[00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:42.400]   That kind of makes sense.
[00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:44.040]   Let the software guys do software.
[00:12:44.040 --> 00:12:45.040]   Right?
[00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:46.040]   Well, and--
[00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:52.520]   Do you believe they're going to make $9 billion in revenue off of this?
[00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:53.720]   Is that what they're saying?
[00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:58.960]   Yeah, the Yahoo story there, the second one, says they'll get $5 million in profit, $9
[00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:06.200]   billion revenue off of data subscriptions for, say, entertainment or retail services.
[00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:07.200]   Your car.
[00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:08.200]   Oh, this is for--
[00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:09.440]   Are you getting this?
[00:13:09.440 --> 00:13:10.440]   Yes.
[00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:11.440]   $9 billion.
[00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:12.440]   Well, what--
[00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:13.440]   So this is--
[00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:14.440]   So--
[00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:16.040]   This is the money flow is toward Ford, not toward Google.
[00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:17.040]   That's interesting.
[00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:19.400]   Well, I'm sure Ford is paying Google.
[00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:20.800]   But well, let's think about it.
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:23.480]   So your car has a data subscription, right?
[00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:30.160]   So obviously, some of that goes to the carriers, but it's usually offered through the car vendor,
[00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:34.800]   not-- or the Ford, not AT&T, for example.
[00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:43.520]   If you subscribe to a Maps service, because you could always say to people, yeah, hey,
[00:13:43.520 --> 00:13:48.040]   for an easy map service that's constantly updated and has something like Street View,
[00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:50.560]   which is more data intensive, pay us $5.
[00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:51.680]   But that's in my phone.
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:53.160]   I don't want to pay Ford for that.
[00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:54.440]   I already have it in my phone.
[00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:55.440]   I get that.
[00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:56.440]   I get that.
[00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:58.080]   And some people are going to say, I have it in my phone.
[00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:00.920]   Some people are going to say, just put it in the car.
[00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:04.720]   If I were buying it for my mom, I'd be like, just here.
[00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:10.800]   This $9 billion is a complete back-of-enveloped calculation from Morgan Stanley, who says,
[00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:17.760]   well, we figure if each-- there's 75 million vehicles on the road with the Ford badge,
[00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:22.800]   if each generated $10 a month in subscriptions, that would create $9 billion in revenue with
[00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:25.720]   a 55% pre-text margin that's $5 billion.
[00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:26.720]   It's completely made up.
[00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:29.160]   And then if it drives to the same stop on the way--
[00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:30.160]   Right.
[00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:31.160]   --it's in trouble each and every year.
[00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:32.160]   Yeah.
[00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:33.160]   Yeah, I don't--
[00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:37.000]   What if you think about, though, like, OK, think about ML services, right?
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.560]   So let's think about insurance.
[00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:43.720]   If you have this level of connectivity in your car, you could actually-- Ford could
[00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:49.800]   offer you insurance in conjunction with someone else and take a cut of that revenue.
[00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:50.800]   They're already doing that.
[00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:56.720]   With the new Mach E, which is electric vehicle, they have deals with all the chargers so that
[00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:59.560]   I don't have to give them a credit card.
[00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:03.440]   The car communicates with the charger and says, yeah, yeah, this Leo, charge it to his
[00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:04.520]   account.
[00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:06.600]   So they're already doing those kinds of deals.
[00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:08.240]   And I think that that's just the beginning.
[00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:13.600]   And Ford even said, Jim Farley, their new CEO, even said, what we're looking at is ways
[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:18.120]   to make-- just like Apple did-- revenue per customer.
[00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:19.120]   Not more customers, but revenue per--
[00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:20.120]   Right, our poo.
[00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:21.120]   Yeah, our poo.
[00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:22.120]   Yeah.
[00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:23.120]   Yeah.
[00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:26.480]   What's the deal on the serious with an automaker?
[00:15:26.480 --> 00:15:27.480]   I don't know.
[00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:28.480]   I don't--
[00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:32.240]   Most of them come-- at least the cars I've had lately, you know, you get six months of
[00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:33.240]   serious and then--
[00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:37.120]   Right, so I'm presuming the pastures you for the rest of your life saying, well, haven't
[00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:38.120]   you subscribed?
[00:15:38.120 --> 00:15:39.120]   Why haven't you subscribed?
[00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:40.120]   Why haven't you subscribed?
[00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:41.120]   Have you heard a podcast?
[00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:43.920]   I don't use those messages at all.
[00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:45.720]   Serious is annoying, aren't they?
[00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:47.160]   Oh, yeah.
[00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:48.160]   So--
[00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:50.720]   But I assume that serious pays the automaker for the marketing experience.
[00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:51.720]   Yeah, I bet you.
[00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:52.720]   Yeah.
[00:15:52.720 --> 00:15:53.720]   Right, so there's something there I guess.
[00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:56.000]   And maybe there's a spiff to think I should have subscribed.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   Yeah.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.440]   It never gets me excited.
[00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:01.440]   It sounded like--
[00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:02.440]   Howard.
[00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:03.440]   Oh, yeah.
[00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:04.440]   Howard.
[00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:06.440]   Oh, Howard.
[00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:09.560]   Anyway, there's the Ford story.
[00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:12.560]   It's kind of an interesting story.
[00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:13.560]   And that's--
[00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:14.560]   And that's--
[00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:15.560]   Yeah.
[00:16:15.560 --> 00:16:16.560]   Yeah.
[00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:21.560]   And I'm even more interested because there's a car outside with my name on it.
[00:16:21.560 --> 00:16:22.560]   Okay.
[00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:26.200]   Let's move on.
[00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:28.200]   There's a lot of money going on right now.
[00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:31.120]   Money talk-- I don't want to become the money talk show.
[00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:35.120]   All of our shows have-- last week was GameStop, right?
[00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:38.080]   This week, it's Alphabet.
[00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:39.080]   So Google had--
[00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:40.080]   Well, it's earnings.
[00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:41.080]   I mean, come on.
[00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:42.080]   It's an interesting story.
[00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:43.080]   Yeah.
[00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:45.840]   But Google's had good earnings before.
[00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:52.000]   Revenue up 23% add business showing strong growth up 47%.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:17:04.840]   The Google revenue was 56.9 billion, 3 billion more than the analysts predicted.
[00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:06.120]   So yeah, very positive.
[00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:09.000]   But does that explain the Google stock price?
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.160]   Holy cow, is it up?
[00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:15.440]   Let me pull up their ticker.
[00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:16.440]   Why wouldn't it?
[00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:18.440]   I mean, there's a lot of people in 4% today.
[00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:21.440]   There's way more time at home watching YouTube.
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:23.040]   More than they were before.
[00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:27.880]   Well, we're trying to find a new tutorial to get themselves a new skill or something
[00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:31.640]   right now during this pandemic because it can't really go back to work or just work
[00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:33.120]   on a side hustle.
[00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:39.000]   You're implying that stock prices have something to do with the fundamentals of the company.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.280]   But in my opinion, it doesn't.
[00:17:42.280 --> 00:17:44.280]   Google's fundamentals are good.
[00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:45.280]   They're excellent.
[00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:46.280]   Absolutely.
[00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:49.760]   I mean, the ad market obviously did great by them.
[00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:56.080]   Plus, they've got their signing and announcing these crazy long deals like Ford and-- no,
[00:17:56.080 --> 00:17:57.320]   that was Apple.
[00:17:57.320 --> 00:17:59.280]   Anyway, they're doing it.
[00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:00.480]   I mean, from a fundamentals plan.
[00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:01.480]   For the cloud, yeah.
[00:18:01.480 --> 00:18:05.160]   But can I point out, Google doesn't pay dividends.
[00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:11.520]   So the stock price isn't-- how-- this is a conversation last week.
[00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:12.880]   I don't get out of the stock price.
[00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:14.080]   You say zero some game.
[00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:15.080]   I'm just going to scream.
[00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:19.720]   No, but the stock prices depend on what people are paying for it.
[00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:21.680]   You know, it's like a real estate market.
[00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:24.600]   The house is worth whatever anybody will pay for it.
[00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:28.960]   And since there's no dividend from Google, you don't have any direct link to Google's
[00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:30.600]   success or failure.
[00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:32.320]   It's just what people will pay for it.
[00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:34.680]   So let's talk about Google's cloud services.
[00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:35.680]   OK.
[00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:36.680]   I know.
[00:18:36.680 --> 00:18:38.440]   I'm sorry I brought it up.
[00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:39.440]   I'm sorry I brought it up.
[00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:40.440]   I was hoping you could explain it.
[00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:41.960]   They're losing less money.
[00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:43.320]   How it's tied.
[00:18:43.320 --> 00:18:50.200]   They're basically-- so their revenue has gone up considerably.
[00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:51.480]   They're at 13 billion.
[00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:54.480]   Last year they were at almost 9 billion.
[00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:59.520]   And they're losing less money based on their revenue.
[00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:00.520]   So that's good.
[00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:03.120]   They are losing 5.6 billion.
[00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:04.120]   But a lot of these--
[00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:05.120]   Who's losing money?
[00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:06.120]   Google.
[00:19:06.120 --> 00:19:07.120]   Google's losing money.
[00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:09.120]   What are you talking about?
[00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:10.920]   In their cloud segment.
[00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:11.920]   Wow.
[00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:12.920]   Wow.
[00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:15.520]   Their cloud segment hasn't been competitive ever.
[00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:16.520]   Right?
[00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:17.520]   I know.
[00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:18.520]   It's consistently lost money.
[00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:19.520]   They're consistently making it--
[00:19:19.520 --> 00:19:20.520]   But they're losing less money.
[00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:22.520]   They've lost less money.
[00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:23.520]   I get it.
[00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:24.520]   It's improvement.
[00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:25.520]   OK.
[00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:27.520]   This may be this four deal will help.
[00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:28.520]   Right?
[00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:29.520]   Yeah.
[00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:38.120]   Their Google cloud revenue 3.83 billion, which is out of 56 billion.
[00:19:38.120 --> 00:19:39.120]   So it's not a big part.
[00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:41.320]   Oh, I'm talking annual results.
[00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:42.320]   So annual--
[00:19:42.320 --> 00:19:43.320]   OK.
[00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:48.120]   For 2020 they earned 13 billion and they lost 5.6 billion.
[00:19:48.120 --> 00:19:49.120]   Wow.
[00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:50.120]   So--
[00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:53.920]   But 19 they made 9 billion and they lost 4.6 billion.
[00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:57.120]   Oh, I would buy some stock now.
[00:19:57.120 --> 00:19:58.120]   They're losing--
[00:19:58.120 --> 00:19:59.120]   Especially after this four deal.
[00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:01.120]   They're losing money slower.
[00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:04.120]   That's good.
[00:20:04.120 --> 00:20:10.320]   And Pichai, Sundar Pichai said that they have done--
[00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:12.920]   They're deals that are over a quarter of a million--
[00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:13.920]   Oh, not a quarter of a million--
[00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:16.120]   a quarter of a billion dollars more than tripled.
[00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:19.320]   So that's pretty good.
[00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:21.320]   Go Thomas Curry.
[00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:22.320]   OK.
[00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:23.320]   OK.
[00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:24.320]   I'm done.
[00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:25.320]   I'm trying to talk to you about money.
[00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:26.320]   No, I know.
[00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:27.320]   And I--
[00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:28.320]   He's being--
[00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:29.320]   I'm sorry.
[00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:30.320]   That's all.
[00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:31.320]   You just be difficult.
[00:20:31.320 --> 00:20:32.320]   That's OK.
[00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:33.320]   It's really dumb.
[00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:36.320]   Usually I'm trying to be difficult.
[00:20:36.320 --> 00:20:39.320]   Well, unless you're saying something fun, like Google is killing a business.
[00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:40.320]   But you just are.
[00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:41.320]   OK.
[00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:42.320]   It's time to take a break.
[00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:44.320]   Are you sure today?
[00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:46.320]   I just am difficult.
[00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:49.320]   Our show today is brought to you by Melissa.
[00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:53.320]   Now, this is a company I know and really appreciate.
[00:20:53.320 --> 00:21:02.320]   Melissa is a company that actually started and I think it was back many years ago, 35 years ago.
[00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:04.320]   And it was probably at that time correcting zip codes.
[00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:06.320]   Remember when the zip codes first came out?
[00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:07.320]   Nobody knew there was zip code.
[00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:09.320]   And then there was the zip plus four.
[00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:13.320]   Melissa has been doing that for a long time.
[00:21:13.320 --> 00:21:17.320]   And as the years have gone by, they've added more and more capabilities.
[00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:23.320]   Now you can verify full addresses, emails, phone numbers, and names.
[00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:26.320]   And there-- you could do it in real time.
[00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:27.320]   They're so fast.
[00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:34.320]   They have a global address verification service that could verify addresses for 240 plus countries and territories.
[00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:36.320]   And they can do it as you enter it.
[00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:42.320]   So you've probably experienced this, whether you're on a form and you're starting to enter it and it says, you mean this?
[00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:43.320]   Melissa.
[00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:51.320]   Or if you're a customer service rep, you know, it's so easy to accidentally type the wrong zip code or transpose street numbers.
[00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:52.320]   Melissa fixes it.
[00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:55.320]   They make sure your data is accurate and current.
[00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:56.320]   And that's important in any business.
[00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:57.320]   You want to reach the right customers.
[00:21:57.320 --> 00:22:01.320]   You don't want to waste money sending mail to the wrong address.
[00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:05.320]   Their tools are going to save you money.
[00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:08.320]   They're going to make sure your customer data is good.
[00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:11.320]   And customer data goes bad even after it's entered.
[00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:15.320]   In fact, around 30% of customer data goes bad every year.
[00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:19.320]   So there's the real-time Melissa that'll help you with the data entry.
[00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:24.320]   And then there's an ongoing relationship with Melissa that makes sure your data is accurate as time goes by.
[00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:28.320]   You can even add customer demographic information to your records.
[00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:33.320]   Public information like property, mortgage data, marital status, social media handles.
[00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:35.320]   So you can know your customer better.
[00:22:35.320 --> 00:22:37.320]   You can interact with them better.
[00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:39.320]   Melissa has completely flexible deployment options.
[00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:43.320]   Whether it's on-prem, there's a web service you can use.
[00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:45.320]   They have secure FTP processing.
[00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:46.320]   You upload a database.
[00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:48.320]   You download the clean database.
[00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:50.320]   Software as a service.
[00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:54.320]   You could choose the best way to meet your particular needs.
[00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:58.320]   Of course, Melissa treats every bit of data carefully.
[00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:02.320]   It's so important that the data is secure.
[00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:09.320]   They continually undergo independent security audits to reinforce their commitment to data security, privacy and compliance requirements.
[00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:12.320]   Melissa has the utmost dedication to your data security.
[00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:14.320]   They implement strong controls and safeguards.
[00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:18.320]   When processing your data, SOC 2 HIPAA GDPR compliant.
[00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:23.320]   Trust Melissa to be your foundation for data-driven success.
[00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:25.320]   Melissa is a great company too.
[00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:30.320]   They are supporting communities and qualifying essential workers during COVID-19.
[00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:33.320]   See if your organization qualifies for six months of free service.
[00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:40.320]   You can apply online, melissa.com/twit.
[00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:43.320]   So don't put up with sour customer contact data.
[00:23:43.320 --> 00:23:46.320]   Try Melissa's APIs in the developer portal.
[00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:52.320]   It's easy to log on, easy to sign up and start playing in the API sandbox 24/7.

[00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:04.320]   M-E-L-I-S-S-A-M-Lissa.com/twit.
[00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:08.320]   Let's see.
[00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:12.320]   Yeah, I mean, it was a good quarter for Alphabet.
[00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:14.320]   Their stock went up a lot.
[00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:17.320]   What else?
[00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:21.320]   Stadia, though, not such a good news cycle for Stadia.
[00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:27.320]   They have announced that they are going to shut down their independent game studio.
[00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:31.320]   Jade Raymond, who they brought in with great fanfare.
[00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:37.320]   She's a very well-known game developer from some of the biggest game platforms, is out.
[00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:40.320]   Did you play any Stadia games?
[00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:43.320]   Well, had they released any of their internal games?
[00:24:43.320 --> 00:24:47.320]   I don't know. I played Cyberpunk 2077.
[00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:49.320]   They're on, I mean, yeah.
[00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:51.320]   I don't know what they...
[00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:52.320]   It's a game on Stadia.
[00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:54.320]   I don't know which ones were theirs.
[00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:55.320]   Probably so.
[00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:56.320]   Yeah.
[00:24:56.320 --> 00:24:59.320]   That's a historically very difficult thing to do.
[00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:01.320]   It's very expensive to develop games.
[00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:04.320]   It's a very hit-driven industry and a lot of them flop.
[00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:06.320]   It takes years to do it.
[00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:12.320]   They brought in, you know, Raymond is a veteran producer who created Assassin's Creed.
[00:25:12.320 --> 00:25:17.320]   So they brought in, you know, heavy hitter, but boy, they didn't give her a lot of time.
[00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:20.320]   Less than a year.
[00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:22.320]   I'm trying to remember when they hired her.
[00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:25.320]   Though, the service is going to continue.
[00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:29.320]   As is the $10 Stadia Pro service, they're going to continue to offer games.
[00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:33.320]   I have to say though, it must shake people up who are invested in Stadia.
[00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:34.320]   I'm a...
[00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:35.320]   I have a pro membership.
[00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:37.320]   I don't use it that often.
[00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:40.320]   The advantage of Stadia is the games run on their servers.
[00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:43.320]   There's a lot of companies doing this now including Microsoft.
[00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:52.320]   And you can run it on low or inexpensive hardware like a Chromebook or an Android phone, even though it's a very high-end game because all the work is being done on the servers.
[00:25:52.320 --> 00:25:54.320]   That is going to continue.
[00:25:54.320 --> 00:26:03.320]   The disadvantage Stadia has compared to something like GeForce Now, which is another competitor or Microsoft's X-Cloud is, you buy the game from Google and you don't have a copy.
[00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:06.320]   You can't play it anywhere else.
[00:26:06.320 --> 00:26:17.320]   And so when anything that happens is shaky to Stadia that concerns people at Stadia is going to really, I think, impact them going down the road.
[00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:25.320]   It's blamed that being a disadvantage because you don't have a copy or it's a difference between...
[00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:29.320]   Well, if Stadia goes out of business, what happens to your game?
[00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:30.320]   I don't know.
[00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:32.320]   Yeah, you spent 30 or 60 bucks on something.
[00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:33.320]   The likes of Steam?
[00:26:33.320 --> 00:26:34.320]   No, right?
[00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:35.320]   No.
[00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:39.320]   Well, I mean, you download the Steam game.
[00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:40.320]   Now you're playing it on your computer.
[00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:41.320]   You have it.
[00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:48.320]   I guess if Steam went offline, maybe it wouldn't do it in any piracy check or something.
[00:26:48.320 --> 00:26:49.320]   But you have the game.
[00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:50.320]   Save the game with Microsoft.
[00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:51.320]   You buy the game.
[00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:52.320]   You own the game.
[00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:56.320]   In this case, you own the game, but it's through Google.
[00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:59.320]   It's GeForce Now, for instance.
[00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:01.320]   You can use Play Your Steam Games on GeForce Now.
[00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:04.320]   You could play your EA games on GeForce Now.
[00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:11.320]   So you buy the game in a normal fashion, but you can play it on your Android device through the GeForce Now servers.
[00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:15.320]   It's a little weird if you're with Stadia.
[00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:17.320]   It's a little different situation.
[00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:19.320]   We were talking about this on Windows Weekly.
[00:27:19.320 --> 00:27:29.320]   Paul speculated maybe if Google decided to pull the plug on Stadia, they'd give somebody else the game so you could play it with them.
[00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:30.320]   I don't know.
[00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:32.320]   The thing is, it's the maybe that's concerning.
[00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:42.320]   If you're going to spend 60 bucks on Cyberpunk 2077 and you can only play it on Stadia, and Stadia starts to look shaky, that seems concerning.
[00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:43.320]   Okay.
[00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:45.320]   Now I see the picture.
[00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:48.320]   I have that trial or whatever.
[00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:49.320]   I guess I still have a pro account.
[00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:51.320]   I probably should look to see if I can start.
[00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:53.320]   You're paying 10 bucks a month or nothing.
[00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:58.320]   And I've played that thing just sort of here and there.
[00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:00.320]   I've played that Destiny 2.
[00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:01.320]   Yeah.
[00:28:01.320 --> 00:28:04.320]   Even though I never even knew what Destiny 1 was, and it was pretty fun.
[00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:05.320]   It's a good game.
[00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:08.320]   I mean, the F1 game and it's really hard.
[00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:19.320]   My only problem with the Stadia service is I would definitely have to run some type of ethernet cable down to the TV because of the latency and the performance of it from an internet standpoint is a problem.
[00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:28.320]   That's what makes me just turn it off and find something else to do, like a podcast to listen to or something else to watch.
[00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:31.320]   Yeah.
[00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:36.320]   So I think that that's what's interesting about all of these things is who are they aimed at?
[00:28:36.320 --> 00:28:45.320]   If you're a hardcore gamer, you probably have a gaming PC and you're buying the games if you're serious or a console and you're serious.
[00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:52.320]   So it's offering these hardcore games to people like you and me who are casual gamers.
[00:28:52.320 --> 00:28:55.320]   I don't know what kind of business that is.
[00:28:55.320 --> 00:29:01.320]   And when I thought about the whole ethernet Wi-Fi, I felt full I was having hard heads.
[00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:12.320]   They play, well, one of them, he plays Xbox and it's wireless and he never complains about performance issues from the internet, you know, dropping packets or whatnot.
[00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:20.320]   But maybe it was just the whole Chromecast Ultra in addition to Wi-Fi for me that made a difference with performance.
[00:29:20.320 --> 00:29:27.320]   But I said, no, I can't deal with this. I'd much rather be sitting at this desk with a ethernet cable.
[00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:28.320]   You're not.
[00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:33.320]   Yeah, so that's the question. Who's going to pay 60 bucks for a game but isn't a serious gamer?
[00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:36.320]   So that was always kind of the question mark on this.
[00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:41.320]   And then I think it really just adds to the overall feeling that Google just kills stuff, right?
[00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:42.320]   It won't last.
[00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:47.320]   They're not killing Stadia, but they're killing their independent Stadia development team.
[00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:51.320]   And I think that sends a signal to people that, yeah, maybe this isn't a long-term thing.
[00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:55.320]   I think it just hastens the end of the line for Stadia.
[00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:58.320]   Oh, I didn't realize they weren't killing Stadia.
[00:29:58.320 --> 00:30:01.320]   Oh, yeah, see? That's exactly my point.
[00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:03.320]   That's exactly what they're not.
[00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:06.320]   Third party games, Cyberpunk, I'll still be able to play that.
[00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:12.320]   It's just they were developing, they had an in-house game development team and they were developing their own games.
[00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:15.320]   And so it's not going to do that anymore.
[00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:18.320]   But that's exactly the problem.
[00:30:18.320 --> 00:30:20.320]   There's people will say, "Oh, I guess it killed Stadia."
[00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:21.320]   That's one.
[00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:28.320]   And then people like, well, a lot of people are saying, "Oh, man, now I'm wondering what the future Stadia holds."
[00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:32.320]   I have a feeling this is not a good thing.
[00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:35.320]   What is Google not?
[00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:37.320]   Not killing?
[00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:38.320]   Advertising.
[00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:40.320]   It's a search ad in Android.
[00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:41.320]   Yeah, search ads.
[00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:42.320]   YouTube.
[00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:43.320]   And YouTube.
[00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:44.320]   And YouTube.
[00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:52.320]   The department, you can say it to a keep Stadia around just a little bit longer because it's sort of stopping the bleeding, right?
[00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:54.320]   A little bit longer.
[00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:56.320]   Not much longer.
[00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:59.320]   Oh, just what you want to invest in.
[00:30:59.320 --> 00:31:02.320]   It's a company that's sort of stopping the bleeding.
[00:31:02.320 --> 00:31:04.320]   Yeah, they're sort of.
[00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:09.320]   Well, the other thing is in this business, exclusives are important to selling a platform.
[00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:14.320]   So the exclusives that PlayStation brings to the PlayStation 5 sells the platform.
[00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:20.320]   If that's a game you want to play, what you got to buy it, Xbox has not so many exclusives,
[00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:21.320]   but it's widely considered.
[00:31:21.320 --> 00:31:26.320]   That's an important part of any console is these exclusives.
[00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:31.320]   It's one thing that Amazon's Luna, which is a similar offering, G-Force now,
[00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:37.320]   X-Cloud from Microsoft, PlayStation now, don't offer exclusives.
[00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:40.320]   Google was gonna.
[00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:42.320]   Not anymore.
[00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:45.320]   So, I think Google works really well.
[00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:46.320]   I love duty.
[00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:48.320]   Google got a lot of attention for Cyberpunk 2077.
[00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:50.320]   It was the only place you could really play it.
[00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:51.320]   You couldn't play it.
[00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:52.320]   It didn't work on consoles very well.
[00:31:52.320 --> 00:31:53.320]   Oh, that's right.
[00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:56.320]   It wasn't a PlayStation that had a big mess about that.
[00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:58.320]   Yeah, they had to give refund.
[00:31:58.320 --> 00:32:00.320]   They had to give refund everybody.
[00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:06.320]   So, and people aren't able to get GPUs for their home gaming PCs.
[00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:08.320]   There's an opportunity there.
[00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:16.320]   But I know they're interesting article on the Verge, which probably lent some credence to
[00:32:16.320 --> 00:32:18.320]   Stacey's point of view.
[00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:23.320]   Sean Hollister writing, "The writing's on the wall for Google's Stadia."
[00:32:23.320 --> 00:32:30.320]   But they point out that Google's never released Stadia sales or subscriber numbers.
[00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:33.320]   So, it's unclear how well they're doing.
[00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:36.320]   Sean says, "I'm wondering if today's announcement tells us everything we need to know.
[00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:42.320]   Google launched Cyberpunk 2777, the hottest game of the year in Stadia.
[00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:48.320]   The Verge called Cyberpunk a "maker break moment" for Stadia.
[00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:52.320]   It worked on Stadia when it didn't work in other places.
[00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:56.320]   But he's wondering, did Google look at Cyberpunk's game sales,
[00:32:56.320 --> 00:33:01.320]   grimace, and wonder if a future Google-produced game could do any better?
[00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:07.320]   And that might be well, you know, was the time, or would explain the timing of killing their own independent offer.
[00:33:07.320 --> 00:33:10.320]   It's millions of dollars to do these games, and it's a long shot.
[00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:13.320]   Does Stadia see the year 2022?
[00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:16.320]   You want to, you want to lay some money on that?
[00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:18.320]   Yeah, let's play some bets.
[00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:21.320]   Does it see the year 2022?
[00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:25.320]   I think your betta be better, will Leo lose weight in 2022, it'd be a safer bet.
[00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:28.320]   Well, then the question is, will Stacey invest in you?
[00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:29.320]   Yes, no.
[00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:31.320]   Oh, probably.
[00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:32.320]   If I gave you two of those...
[00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:35.320]   I invest three hours every week in...
[00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:36.320]   That's a big investment.
[00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:38.320]   I know, it's more than...
[00:33:38.320 --> 00:33:39.320]   Let's look at it that way.
[00:33:39.320 --> 00:33:41.320]   Let's not forget that.
[00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:47.320]   Wanna hear about scissors?
[00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:49.320]   Yeah, what is scissors editors?
[00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:52.320]   And the... this is the more of the Australian story.
[00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:53.320]   What is this?
[00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:55.320]   I hear the scissors.
[00:33:55.320 --> 00:33:56.320]   Are you cutting your hair?
[00:33:56.320 --> 00:34:01.320]   I'm doing my research for my Gutenberg book, and I came across some really fascinating stuff in a book.
[00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:02.320]   Do I have it here?
[00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:03.320]   Yes, I do.
[00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:06.320]   The St. Paul Globe, 1886.
[00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:09.320]   Will Slaughter's Who Owns the News.
[00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:10.320]   A history of copyright.
[00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:12.320]   That's the kind of fun stuff I do.
[00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:13.320]   Yeah.
[00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:14.320]   But it's actually a good book.
[00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:25.320]   So, as you may know, the 1792 Postal Act of the US, I'm sure you haven't memorized, enabled newspapers to
[00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:30.320]   send each other, exchange copies of their newspapers for free through the mail.
[00:34:30.320 --> 00:34:31.320]   No cost at all.
[00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:32.320]   Nothing.
[00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:33.320]   What?
[00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:34.320]   Why would they do that?
[00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:37.320]   Because the point was to encourage them to share each other's news.
[00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:41.320]   I think it was a scam set up by that Ben Franklin feller.
[00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:44.320]   Well, yeah, there's that.
[00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:48.320]   So, newspapers employed what they called scissors editors.
[00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:51.320]   That was their job, was to cut up the other papers.
[00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:54.320]   And either a column of news, okay, here it is, and they put it in.
[00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:58.320]   And it was fine with everybody, because everybody copied everybody else.
[00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:00.320]   So, you didn't hire reporters.
[00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:02.320]   You didn't hire reporters.
[00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:03.320]   You hired that too.
[00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:05.320]   Oh, you had some of your own, but you also--
[00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:06.320]   For your local stuff.
[00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:09.320]   This was before there was AP in--
[00:35:09.320 --> 00:35:10.320]   Before the writers--
[00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:12.320]   1792, was it 1792?
[00:35:12.320 --> 00:35:15.320]   1792 Postal Act, right?
[00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:18.320]   So, newspapers were not covered in copyright at all.
[00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:25.320]   And Slaughter says that probably wouldn't have made any sense to Congress to have done so,
[00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:27.320]   because that's the way news was spread.
[00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:33.320]   It was a policy decision that it was good for democracy and the public conversation for this to work out, right?
[00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:35.320]   And I mean, you go way back--
[00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:37.320]   Don't worry, I won't go too far--
[00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:44.320]   1605, the first newspapers were copies of email newsletters, basically, not email newsletters.
[00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:47.320]   And which in turn were copies of each other's newsletters.
[00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:53.320]   So news since the beginning of its time has been copying each other's snippets,
[00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:57.320]   which is context to me for the Murdoch law in Australia,
[00:35:57.320 --> 00:36:06.320]   where he's trying to force Google and Facebook to pay them for the privilege of sending them free marketing by using snippets.
[00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:09.320]   And it just struck me of the hypocrisy of it.
[00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:11.320]   Well, one of the--
[00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:12.320]   And the news business bill is--
[00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:18.320]   No, one's about geographic dispersion and sharing news around the world.
[00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:24.320]   The other is about arguing if you're taking someone's content or not, I would say.
[00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:27.320]   Or sending them value, which you're doing.
[00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:36.320]   And that's really the issue, is that now there's value sent to them.
[00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:41.320]   But the truth is, Stacey, if newspapers suddenly had to pay each other for the money,
[00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:46.320]   they'd go bankrupt, if sources stopped talking to newspapers and said, "Okay, no, no, if you didn't do this,
[00:36:46.320 --> 00:36:51.320]   Rupert, I'm charging you for the next quote, pay me by the quote."
[00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:53.320]   Then it got to happen.
[00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:59.320]   Newspapers count on free copying of information from others.
[00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:03.320]   And newspapers get value from Google and Facebook sending them audience.
[00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:07.320]   I'm just pointing out the Murdochian hypothesis.
[00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:10.320]   I don't actually disagree with you on this one.
[00:37:10.320 --> 00:37:14.320]   I'm just saying that it doesn't feel quite like the right analogy.
[00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:15.320]   Oh, go ahead.
[00:37:15.320 --> 00:37:18.320]   You guys are going to make an alliance and vote me off the island, aren't you?
[00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:19.320]   I can tell.
[00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:20.320]   No, I just--
[00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:22.320]   [laughter]
[00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:26.320]   I see it going on already.
[00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:33.320]   This is not an area where A, I'm an expert in B, that I have strong feelings.
[00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:36.320]   I have strong feelings about what Murdoch's trying to do in Australia.
[00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:39.320]   I think that's very risky.
[00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:41.320]   And silly and bogus.
[00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:43.320]   Well, it's also spreading to Canada now.
[00:37:43.320 --> 00:37:45.320]   So now Canada is jealous of you.
[00:37:45.320 --> 00:37:46.320]   Really?
[00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:49.320]   Canada is going to do that to the heritage minister there, said this week that they're thinking
[00:37:49.320 --> 00:37:50.320]   of doing the same thing.
[00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:54.320]   The wise thing to do would be to wait and see what happens in Australia first.
[00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:55.320]   Yeah.
[00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:56.320]   Just see how that goes.
[00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:58.320]   Then maybe you could try.
[00:37:58.320 --> 00:38:00.320]   My favorite little bit of the story.
[00:38:00.320 --> 00:38:07.320]   So in 1902, the Charlotte News, I was looking through newspaper.com to find things.
[00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:13.320]   And I found this great little anecdote where papers were fine with being copied, but they
[00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:16.320]   demanded to be credited as well as they should have been, right?
[00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:21.320]   And so the Charlotte News was using stuff, or was-- the Herald was using stuff from the
[00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:22.320]   news.
[00:38:22.320 --> 00:38:23.320]   So the news set a trap for them.
[00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:30.320]   They ran a fake news story about a gang of anarchists from Vladivostok playing to kill
[00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:32.320]   all the prominent rulers of the globe.
[00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:34.320]   And as I say, you thought Q was new.
[00:38:34.320 --> 00:38:36.320]   Police arrested the leader, said the story.
[00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:39.320]   One count, Robikin, Rumwaffe, let's see.
[00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:42.320]   Show the show that show it, John.
[00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:43.320]   So there's the name.
[00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:46.320]   So just as soon as I saw that, I knew exactly what to--
[00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:47.320]   Yeah.
[00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:48.320]   So the news set in the next edition.
[00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:55.320]   If the Arianide scissors editors of the Herald had read the story carefully, he might have noticed the name of the illustrious count was more understandable when read backward.
[00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:56.320]   We steal from our neighbor.
[00:38:56.320 --> 00:38:59.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:00.320]   Wow.
[00:39:00.320 --> 00:39:03.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:05.320]   So I just enjoyed that.
[00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:06.320]   Yeah.
[00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:08.320]   It's been going on as long as time.
[00:39:08.320 --> 00:39:10.320]   The story is old as time.
[00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:11.320]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:39:11.320 --> 00:39:12.320]   Hey, Liz, old as time.
[00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:13.320]   Now we're going to get sued by Disney.
[00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:16.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:17.320]   Oh, sorry.
[00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:25.320]   CNBC says Microsoft is the-- no, you said Microsoft is the Eddie Haskell of the Tech industry.
[00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:26.320]   I said that.
[00:39:26.320 --> 00:39:27.320]   I said that.
[00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:28.320]   Because they're backing.
[00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:29.320]   Microsoft's backing Australia's law.
[00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:32.320]   Is that just because they want to stick it to Google?
[00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:33.320]   Yeah.
[00:39:33.320 --> 00:39:34.320]   Yeah.
[00:39:34.320 --> 00:39:35.320]   They're already in Haskell.
[00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:37.320]   They see an opportunity to get Bing in there.
[00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:38.320]   That's what it really is.
[00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:39.320]   That's what it is.
[00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:49.320]   Australian Prime Minister Scott Morris has said a money Microsoft is ready to step in and expand its search product Bing in Australia if Google pulls a search to 20.
[00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:50.320]   10 years, 10 years, 20.
[00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:52.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:39:52.320 --> 00:39:53.320]   Don't worry.
[00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:55.320]   We will help you.
[00:39:55.320 --> 00:40:00.320]   We will bring Bing to the Australian continent.
[00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:01.320]   Oh, boy.
[00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:05.320]   Consider a 94% of the search is Google.
[00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:06.320]   Yeah.
[00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:07.320]   Yeah, look at that.
[00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:08.320]   Wow.
[00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:09.320]   Unbelievable.
[00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:10.320]   I was just getting ready.
[00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:11.320]   I think-- let me ask you this.
[00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:12.320]   Let me ask you this.
[00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:14.320]   I didn't even know because I always did.
[00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:15.320]   Oh, yeah.
[00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:16.320]   Google or Duck, Duck, Go.
[00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:17.320]   Bing's number two.
[00:40:17.320 --> 00:40:18.320]   Bing's number two.
[00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:19.320]   Bing's number two.
[00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:20.320]   Okay.
[00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:21.320]   Here's a question.
[00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:22.320]   Here's a question.
[00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:23.320]   Political question.
[00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:24.320]   So let's say that--
[00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:25.320]   I'm out.
[00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:33.320]   Murdoch missed.
[00:40:33.320 --> 00:40:36.320]   And Google leaves Australia.
[00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:39.320]   What's the political ramifications of that?
[00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:43.320]   I've got to believe that the citizens of Australia are going to be peeved, especially
[00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:44.320]   Aussies say so.
[00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:45.320]   Yeah.
[00:40:45.320 --> 00:40:46.320]   They're not going to be happy.
[00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:47.320]   They'll always come back.
[00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:48.320]   I mean, it's not the end of the-- I mean, they're politicians.
[00:40:48.320 --> 00:40:51.320]   They're doing this because they think they have a way to do this without hacking off people.
[00:40:51.320 --> 00:40:54.320]   If they get voted out on this issue, then maybe they change.
[00:40:54.320 --> 00:40:56.320]   I mean, I don't know.
[00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:57.320]   Aussies are not--
[00:40:57.320 --> 00:40:59.320]   I just think politically, this doesn't seem very--
[00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:00.320]   I don't know.
[00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:04.320]   The way people feel about Google right now, they might be like, "Yeah!"
[00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:06.320]   Oh, but imagine.
[00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:07.320]   Okay.
[00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:12.320]   I mean, I know how I'd feel if I couldn't use Google, even if I, you know, do use Duck, Duck, Go.
[00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:13.320]   Even if you were a dedicated Duck, Duck, Go, Duck.
[00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:18.320]   Yeah, I'd be pretty peeved if some politicians' law--
[00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:23.320]   Or would you-- so who would you be mad at, the politician or Google for abandoning your country?
[00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:28.320]   I might actually-- I bet the politicians are calculating that it would affect Google more.
[00:41:28.320 --> 00:41:30.320]   Like, people would be more angry at Google.
[00:41:30.320 --> 00:41:31.320]   They pulled out.
[00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:35.320]   Yeah, they didn't want to abide by our laws.
[00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:36.320]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:37.320]   They may-- that may be their--
[00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:42.320]   Maybe they're duopoly there with two fairly unpopular proprietors.
[00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:43.320]   Yeah.
[00:41:43.320 --> 00:41:45.320]   I was going to say, Australians don't really love either of them.
[00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:47.320]   So it's Murdoch and who's the other?
[00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:50.320]   Channel 9-something.
[00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:52.320]   It's Corey, Carrick, who I forget his name.
[00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:53.320]   Chat room.
[00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:54.320]   Some other guy.
[00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:55.320]   Some other guy.
[00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:56.320]   Some other guy.
[00:41:56.320 --> 00:41:58.320]   Yeah, some other guy.
[00:41:58.320 --> 00:42:02.320]   Yeah, it's an interesting-- it does-- I agree with you, man.
[00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:04.320]   It seems a little risky.
[00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:05.320]   No.
[00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:08.320]   That they're taking a little political risk.
[00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:09.320]   I think--
[00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:10.320]   They want to--
[00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:11.320]   They want to--
[00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:12.320]   I think--
[00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:14.320]   I mean, clearly that's why Google's threatening it, right?
[00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:15.320]   Well, go ahead, minister.
[00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:16.320]   Let's just see what happens.
[00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:24.320]   And I bet you that Australians did not or do not believe the Google would do that.
[00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:26.320]   So there's a little game of chicken going on.
[00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:29.320]   I mean, Google's not in China-- Google could be in China.
[00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:30.320]   It could have.
[00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:33.320]   I did an interview on ABC Australia where I said this.
[00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:36.320]   Google could have made the compromises and stayed in China.
[00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:38.320]   They chose not to.
[00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:41.320]   Google does believe in the open internet.
[00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:42.320]   Yeah, Google--
[00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:43.320]   I think they would do it.
[00:42:43.320 --> 00:42:48.320]   Google's made some decisions around China that its employees also were like that.
[00:42:48.320 --> 00:42:49.320]   No.
[00:42:49.320 --> 00:42:53.320]   That's funny because, you know, because Huawei is a Chinese phone company
[00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:59.320]   and has historically used Android and because they can no longer use Google Android in China,
[00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:02.320]   they have been, they say, developing a brand new operating system.
[00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:07.320]   They call HarmonyOS, according to Rana Madi already in our technique.
[00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:12.320]   There is no discernible difference between Huawei's, quote, "all new OS"
[00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:13.320]   and Android.
[00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:17.320]   They just forked Android, called it Harmony.
[00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:19.320]   You know, job done.
[00:43:19.320 --> 00:43:20.320]   Well played.
[00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:21.320]   We're over.
[00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:22.320]   We're done.
[00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:23.320]   They can do that completely legally.
[00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:24.320]   It's open source.
[00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:25.320]   Yeah.
[00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:26.320]   You know?
[00:43:26.320 --> 00:43:31.320]   Probably should be better not to call it, you know, a new operating system.
[00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:37.320]   To hear what what Ron writes, to hear Huawei tell the story, HarmonyOS is an original in-house
[00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:44.320]   creation, a defiant act that will let the company break free of American software influence.
[00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:50.320]   Harmony's announcement in 2019 got big splashy articles in the national media.
[00:43:50.320 --> 00:43:53.320]   CNN called HarmonyOS a rival to Android.
[00:43:53.320 --> 00:43:59.320]   Richard Yu, the CEO of Huawei's consumer business group, told CNN that HarmonyOS is completely
[00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:01.320]   different from Android and iOS.
[00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:08.920]   But iOS, even last month, head of consumer software said HarmonyOS is not a copy of Android,
[00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:11.400]   nor is it a copy of iOS.
[00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:17.880]   But Ron looked and it's essentially an Android fork.
[00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:20.480]   He says, "Okay."
[00:44:20.480 --> 00:44:24.880]   And there's a good article, if you want to read more about it, there's a lot of detail
[00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:25.880]   in the SDK.
[00:44:25.880 --> 00:44:29.480]   He's looking at it and so forth.
[00:44:29.480 --> 00:44:30.480]   Well done, Ron.
[00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:33.480]   That was a lot of Google Stacy, huh?
[00:44:33.480 --> 00:44:34.480]   Oh, I'm not done.
[00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:35.480]   I'm probably not.
[00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:36.480]   Oh, we're still Google.
[00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:37.480]   I'm not done.
[00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:40.080]   There's more.
[00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:43.480]   You want to know what a hit the Chromebook is?
[00:44:43.480 --> 00:44:44.480]   Yeah.
[00:44:44.480 --> 00:44:52.080]   Demand has grown 400 percent during the quarantine, according to Canales, all-time high 11 million
[00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:54.320]   units in the past quarter.
[00:44:54.320 --> 00:44:58.160]   That's up from 2.5 in the same time 2019.
[00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:00.920]   And of course, that's got to be education.
[00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:01.920]   A lot of students...
[00:45:01.920 --> 00:45:04.880]   But people looking for cheap computers for their kids at home.
[00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:05.880]   Yep.
[00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:06.880]   A lot of kids working on it.
[00:45:06.880 --> 00:45:07.880]   I think all the whole world works, too.
[00:45:07.880 --> 00:45:11.720]   But people have been out of work and struggling financially.
[00:45:11.720 --> 00:45:15.880]   I am glad that this has been a viable option for a lot of people to have class.
[00:45:15.880 --> 00:45:16.880]   Absolutely.
[00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:19.320]   Some Chromebooks are crazy expensive, though.
[00:45:19.320 --> 00:45:20.320]   Some are.
[00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:23.680]   Before you assume, though, that this is a big...
[00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:27.800]   I mean, look at the graph, because the global tablet market almost exactly the same kind
[00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:28.800]   of growth.
[00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:29.800]   Yep.
[00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:32.760]   So iPads did very, very well as well.
[00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:33.760]   So...
[00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:34.760]   Wow.
[00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:35.760]   That's interesting.
[00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:36.760]   Yeah.
[00:45:36.760 --> 00:45:37.760]   It's really...
[00:45:37.760 --> 00:45:39.600]   I honestly think it really is people not trying to save money as much as just looking
[00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:40.600]   for some way for their...
[00:45:40.600 --> 00:45:42.200]   Because, you know, when you...
[00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:43.200]   Kids weren't studying at home.
[00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:46.800]   One computer at home, maybe an iPad was enough.
[00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:51.520]   All of a sudden, I know many families have a friend of a family of five, three kids.
[00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:55.160]   Each one needs their own computer, because they're all in school at the same time.
[00:45:55.160 --> 00:45:57.080]   Plus dads working at home.
[00:45:57.080 --> 00:46:02.080]   Suddenly, they went from needing one computer to needing four.
[00:46:02.080 --> 00:46:04.840]   That's what's powering this, I think.
[00:46:04.840 --> 00:46:08.320]   So you got a Chromebook for a lot of other...
[00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:09.760]   That's pretty amazing.
[00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:10.760]   But...
[00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:13.080]   Usable options out there now.
[00:46:13.080 --> 00:46:19.000]   But with every bit of good news, a little rain must fall, Jeff.
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:22.360]   Google is apparently discontinuing their tablet Chromebook.
[00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:24.200]   But you didn't buy one of those, did you?
[00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:25.680]   I didn't buy a tablet.
[00:46:25.680 --> 00:46:26.680]   No.
[00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:28.680]   Mr. Tofl, that's still waiting.
[00:46:28.680 --> 00:46:31.360]   It wasn't Kevin's favorite, though.
[00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:32.960]   He did buy it to review it.
[00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:35.320]   He didn't have it long.
[00:46:35.320 --> 00:46:36.320]   It wasn't...
[00:46:36.320 --> 00:46:37.320]   I remember that.
[00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:38.320]   He didn't have it long.
[00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:39.320]   Yeah, they've taken it off the...
[00:46:39.320 --> 00:46:40.320]   Well, he liked the...
[00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:41.320]   Kevin liked the go.
[00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:44.240]   The Pixelbook Go, which is a normal laptop, you know.
[00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:45.240]   Before that, what was the name of it?
[00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:46.240]   I can't even remember it.
[00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:47.240]   It's "Sleaked."
[00:46:47.240 --> 00:46:48.240]   The slate.
[00:46:48.240 --> 00:46:49.240]   Good job.
[00:46:49.240 --> 00:46:50.240]   Very good.
[00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:51.240]   Good job.
[00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:52.240]   You remember that old stuff.
[00:46:52.240 --> 00:46:56.640]   So they're still selling the Pixelbook Go, but the slate is now history.
[00:46:56.640 --> 00:46:57.640]   Bye-bye.
[00:46:57.640 --> 00:46:59.120]   You know what?
[00:46:59.120 --> 00:47:00.680]   Never was that good.
[00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:02.240]   The slate has been struck.
[00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:08.080]   Well, I loved the prior tablet with the keyboard I loved.
[00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:09.800]   I was almost my main machine.
[00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:11.800]   Oh, the PixelB-C.
[00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:14.360]   Oh, give me my mournful desire.
[00:47:14.360 --> 00:47:17.360]   I'm like, "Oh, Jeff, we know."
[00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:18.800]   The PixelB-C, that was great.
[00:47:18.800 --> 00:47:22.960]   That was the one with this keyboard kind of had turned and it would go out.
[00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:23.960]   It was really cool.
[00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:25.240]   Yeah, I gave it to somebody.
[00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:26.240]   I don't remember who.
[00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:27.240]   Nexus 7.
[00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:28.240]   I missed my Google app.
[00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:29.520]   Nexus 7, that's 7-inch.
[00:47:29.520 --> 00:47:31.520]   Nexus 7.
[00:47:31.520 --> 00:47:39.480]   I wonder if, honestly, no Android tablet I've ever used has been very satisfying.
[00:47:39.480 --> 00:47:41.960]   The operating system does not lend itself well.
[00:47:41.960 --> 00:47:42.960]   You're right.
[00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:43.960]   You're absolutely right.
[00:47:43.960 --> 00:47:48.160]   And that's just because the software is not really tuned for that kind of thing.
[00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:53.800]   The slate was a 3000 by 2012.3-inch LCD.
[00:47:53.800 --> 00:47:55.560]   It was a really nice screen.
[00:47:55.560 --> 00:47:57.440]   It used a pen.
[00:47:57.440 --> 00:48:00.000]   It had Intel processors.
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:01.000]   Here's one problem.
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:02.160]   It started.
[00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:05.000]   The entry level model was 600 bucks.
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:06.520]   Oh, I was off.
[00:48:06.520 --> 00:48:08.200]   I was thinking it was like 800.
[00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:09.200]   Yeah.
[00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:10.200]   Yeah.
[00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:11.200]   Plus keyboard, right?
[00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:14.200]   Yeah, then you had to buy a keyboard and pen and all that.
[00:48:14.200 --> 00:48:16.200]   That's the $800 to actually keyboard.
[00:48:16.200 --> 00:48:18.000]   That's what it was.
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:20.120]   God, I'm sick of all this Google news.
[00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:21.120]   Geez.
[00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:22.120]   I know.
[00:48:22.120 --> 00:48:23.120]   Geez.
[00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:24.120]   You're something else in that?
[00:48:24.120 --> 00:48:25.120]   What the heck?
[00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:30.200]   I'm just trying to get back on the Android tablet with the OS and whatnot.
[00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:34.720]   But I'm still not the biggest fan of iPad and iPad OS.
[00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:36.440]   I don't know what's wrong with works.
[00:48:36.440 --> 00:48:41.520]   But if I'm just trying to download a file, it just, well, you don't download files.
[00:48:41.520 --> 00:48:44.120]   I've had to be easy away for me to find my files.
[00:48:44.120 --> 00:48:45.960]   Why would you download a file?
[00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:47.600]   What is that about?
[00:48:47.600 --> 00:48:53.200]   If I pull in a camera raw file from my creative cloud because I'd rather process that camera
[00:48:53.200 --> 00:48:55.280]   raw file on the iPad.
[00:48:55.280 --> 00:48:58.640]   Well, if you use Lightroom, it'll be a snap.
[00:48:58.640 --> 00:48:59.640]   Yeah, supposedly.
[00:48:59.640 --> 00:49:00.640]   Yeah.
[00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:02.120]   So you're just not using the right software.
[00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:03.120]   What do you use?
[00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:06.080]   Well, I have Lightroom and I also have Photoshop for iPad.
[00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:07.080]   I have the great software.
[00:49:07.080 --> 00:49:10.600]   But you need Lightroom on the desktop and then Lightroom on the, and you have to use Adobe
[00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:15.200]   Sync on the iPad and use Adobe's cloud, then it's already, then it's there.
[00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:17.160]   So wherever you put it, it's everywhere else.
[00:49:17.160 --> 00:49:20.640]   Edits and everything are automatically propagate from desktop to iPad.
[00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:21.960]   I don't do it either.
[00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:22.960]   Yeah.
[00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:25.320]   It's a little bit cluegy.
[00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:29.720]   The other good, the other workflow that I do use is just using Apple Zone tools, which
[00:49:29.720 --> 00:49:31.440]   is Apple Photos.
[00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:33.480]   And then you can have Pixelmator Photo.
[00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:37.200]   So it's in Photos, which is your catalog.
[00:49:37.200 --> 00:49:40.160]   It has its own kind of limited editing, but it's not bad.
[00:49:40.160 --> 00:49:42.920]   And then you can say, but open that in Pixelmator Photo.
[00:49:42.920 --> 00:49:44.320]   This is all on the iPad.
[00:49:44.320 --> 00:49:46.560]   Do the editing, save it back to Photos.
[00:49:46.560 --> 00:49:48.240]   And that goes to your cloud.
[00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:49.240]   You don't use Max either.
[00:49:49.240 --> 00:49:50.320]   So it's not for you.
[00:49:50.320 --> 00:49:51.320]   That's all.
[00:49:51.320 --> 00:49:52.320]   It's not for you.
[00:49:52.320 --> 00:49:57.440]   I mean, and I even try to use like a Finiti Photo on iPad and the excellent program.
[00:49:57.440 --> 00:49:59.440]   The whole file browsing.
[00:49:59.440 --> 00:50:02.960]   Yeah, because you're thinking of it as a desktop operating system.
[00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:05.360]   That's the real disconnect people get when they get the iPad.
[00:50:05.360 --> 00:50:08.440]   There's no, you think it really isn't a file system exactly.
[00:50:08.440 --> 00:50:09.440]   It's not, I mean, you know there is one.
[00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:11.680]   I think it is a media consumption device.
[00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:13.600]   Well, you could do photo editing.
[00:50:13.600 --> 00:50:14.600]   That's the only reason.
[00:50:14.600 --> 00:50:15.600]   You could do photo editing.
[00:50:15.600 --> 00:50:19.080]   You could do photo editing, but for security reasons, you can't, it's difficult.
[00:50:19.080 --> 00:50:23.320]   It made a little easier, but it's still difficult to see files owned by other programs.
[00:50:23.320 --> 00:50:24.320]   Yeah.
[00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:29.920]   You know, each, each program has its own documents.
[00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:35.040]   I think it's more a cognitive disconnect because you're, you're such a Windows guy,
[00:50:35.040 --> 00:50:36.520]   such a desktop guy.
[00:50:36.520 --> 00:50:37.520]   Right.
[00:50:37.520 --> 00:50:38.520]   I see you.
[00:50:38.520 --> 00:50:39.520]   I struggle with it.
[00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:44.160]   So I just spend more time just consuming content on that thing when I actually decide
[00:50:44.160 --> 00:50:45.160]   to pick it up.
[00:50:45.160 --> 00:50:46.160]   It's a good choice for that.
[00:50:46.160 --> 00:50:48.040]   For us to write something to create on it.
[00:50:48.040 --> 00:50:49.040]   Yeah.
[00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:53.420]   I mean, honestly, I use the Mac, but it is nice to have that touch interface for like
[00:50:53.420 --> 00:50:55.920]   selecting and quick edits.
[00:50:55.920 --> 00:50:58.360]   Pencil, the pencil and the iPad.
[00:50:58.360 --> 00:50:59.840]   I love the Apple pencil.
[00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:04.080]   When I, you know, if I'm in Photoshop and doing some light and it's great.
[00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:05.760]   It's a nice way to do masking.
[00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:06.760]   Yeah.
[00:51:06.760 --> 00:51:07.760]   Yeah.
[00:51:07.760 --> 00:51:11.280]   And then the pinch, you can zoom in and then do that and pinch to zoom out.
[00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:13.320]   I mean, it's a very natural workflow.
[00:51:13.320 --> 00:51:14.320]   Mm hmm.
[00:51:14.320 --> 00:51:15.320]   I'm with you.
[00:51:15.320 --> 00:51:21.480]   So obviously when the original iPad came out on this very show, I reboxed it because it
[00:51:21.480 --> 00:51:22.760]   wasn't made for making it.
[00:51:22.760 --> 00:51:23.760]   Wow.
[00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:24.760]   Was that on this show?
[00:51:24.760 --> 00:51:25.760]   Ten years ago.
[00:51:25.760 --> 00:51:26.760]   I reboxed it.
[00:51:26.760 --> 00:51:28.100]   Yeah.
[00:51:28.100 --> 00:51:29.760]   That was your first rebox.
[00:51:29.760 --> 00:51:30.960]   That was my first rebox.
[00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:31.960]   Yes.
[00:51:31.960 --> 00:51:32.960]   I think we really used that.
[00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:34.600]   You hated it that much.
[00:51:34.600 --> 00:51:36.000]   Oh, these rebox so many things.
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:37.000]   So many things.
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:38.000]   That's my complaint.
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:39.000]   Yeah.
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:40.000]   He's.
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:41.840]   Oh, well, that's I mean, I was somewhat wrong.
[00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:42.840]   Yeah.
[00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:43.840]   It was better.
[00:51:43.840 --> 00:51:44.840]   The pro is better.
[00:51:44.840 --> 00:51:47.760]   But I love the pro with the keyboard and everything.
[00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:48.760]   But yeah, I don't know.
[00:51:48.760 --> 00:51:51.160]   That would be the route I'd go, but it's just that's really.
[00:51:51.160 --> 00:51:54.200]   It's expensive and it's, you know, it's not a computer.
[00:51:54.200 --> 00:51:55.200]   So right.
[00:51:55.200 --> 00:51:56.200]   It's Apple.
[00:51:56.200 --> 00:51:57.200]   It's Apple.
[00:51:57.200 --> 00:51:59.160]   It's whatever that is.
[00:51:59.160 --> 00:52:02.120]   Google is speaking of Apple and Google.
[00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:03.440]   We weren't, weren't we?
[00:52:03.440 --> 00:52:04.440]   I think.
[00:52:04.440 --> 00:52:11.360]   Google has found an interesting solution to the Apple privacy conundrum.
[00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:17.600]   ATT, the application tracking something.
[00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:21.080]   Apple has, of course, the ID for advertisers, IDFA.
[00:52:21.080 --> 00:52:28.520]   And Apple has said that soon with the release of iOS 14.5, which is probably a month or
[00:52:28.520 --> 00:52:36.480]   two away, everybody will have to offer any time you put an app on an iPad or an iPhone.
[00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:41.960]   Well, after I tell the user what your privacy policy is and offer them the choice to turn
[00:52:41.960 --> 00:52:45.280]   off the ID for advertisers.
[00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:51.120]   That's the one that Facebook took at a full page ad and said, "You're killing small business."
[00:52:51.120 --> 00:52:53.640]   So Google's found a solution, a way around this.
[00:52:53.640 --> 00:52:56.400]   They're not going to use it.
[00:52:56.400 --> 00:52:57.680]   They're going to do something else.
[00:52:57.680 --> 00:52:59.640]   Now, you can do this because you're Google.
[00:52:59.640 --> 00:53:06.360]   Google is, I'm sure, going to use some sort of even more sticky tracking system that
[00:53:06.360 --> 00:53:08.280]   works better anyway.
[00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:12.920]   Google said now, remember we said that Google hadn't updated anything since before Christmas
[00:53:12.920 --> 00:53:18.040]   because we thought they did not want to do that privacy nutrition label thing.
[00:53:18.040 --> 00:53:23.240]   Google now says, "It's iPhone apps will stop using data from the so-called third parties
[00:53:23.240 --> 00:53:24.680]   to personalize ads."
[00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:27.960]   Big change for Google.
[00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:31.240]   Facebook has said, "No, we're going to show the pop-up, give users the choice, but we're
[00:53:31.240 --> 00:53:35.560]   just going to try to convince them to say, 'Let us do that.'"
[00:53:35.560 --> 00:53:42.360]   Then Google's taking a different path.
[00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:44.480]   It's interesting.
[00:53:44.480 --> 00:53:46.840]   I think Google can do this.
[00:53:46.840 --> 00:53:53.720]   Google's maps and YouTube will just stop using the app from Apple, the tool from Apple
[00:53:53.720 --> 00:53:57.320]   that lets them personalize ads so they don't have to pop up that warning.
[00:53:57.320 --> 00:53:59.120]   They're just going to use it.
[00:53:59.120 --> 00:54:02.640]   In effect, turn it off so you don't have to.
[00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:06.840]   It's my contention they're only doing that because they have some better way of tracking
[00:54:06.840 --> 00:54:07.840]   you.
[00:54:07.840 --> 00:54:09.840]   They don't really need it.
[00:54:09.840 --> 00:54:10.840]   They don't really need it.
[00:54:10.840 --> 00:54:14.560]   Well, we talked about this a little bit last week.
[00:54:14.560 --> 00:54:17.800]   It's going to be the big guys can afford to do with the old big guy.
[00:54:17.800 --> 00:54:18.800]   That's right.
[00:54:18.800 --> 00:54:20.800]   And the little guys can't.
[00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:28.160]   It's another unintended consequence of threatened regulation that in regulatory capture, the
[00:54:28.160 --> 00:54:30.160]   big guys win.
[00:54:30.160 --> 00:54:33.760]   All right, we're going to talk all about GameStop next.
[00:54:33.760 --> 00:54:34.760]   No, we're not.
[00:54:34.760 --> 00:54:35.760]   I'm just teasing.
[00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:36.760]   There is one more game story.
[00:54:36.760 --> 00:54:37.760]   Oh, isn't I saw all this GameStop story.
[00:54:37.760 --> 00:54:39.560]   I'm sure I promise to talk about it.
[00:54:39.560 --> 00:54:40.560]   No, GameStop.
[00:54:40.560 --> 00:54:41.960]   Okay, one more Google story.
[00:54:41.960 --> 00:54:42.960]   Okay.
[00:54:42.960 --> 00:54:47.180]   Google's, because Ant and I both promise to talk about it on Twitter, which is Google
[00:54:47.180 --> 00:54:50.960]   paying $3.8 million to settle discrimination lawsuits.
[00:54:50.960 --> 00:54:51.960]   Right, Ant?
[00:54:51.960 --> 00:54:52.960]   Oh, yes.
[00:54:52.960 --> 00:54:53.960]   Correct.
[00:54:53.960 --> 00:54:55.760]   Sorry, I did not mean to leave that out.
[00:54:55.760 --> 00:54:57.120]   Oh, no.
[00:54:57.120 --> 00:54:59.440]   It's $3.8 million.
[00:54:59.440 --> 00:55:01.280]   I've read that the head line.
[00:55:01.280 --> 00:55:03.960]   I said, okay, let me dig into it a little bit more.
[00:55:03.960 --> 00:55:10.000]   And it's discussing that it was about 2,500 employees affected or former employees affected
[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:13.160]   by this lawsuit or settlement.
[00:55:13.160 --> 00:55:21.200]   And it struck a nerve because I remember somebody named Andy Rubin, I believe.
[00:55:21.200 --> 00:55:22.200]   Oh, yeah.
[00:55:22.200 --> 00:55:23.200]   How much they give him?
[00:55:23.200 --> 00:55:25.200]   Got, oh, 92 million.
[00:55:25.200 --> 00:55:28.640]   You know, one person.
[00:55:28.640 --> 00:55:36.400]   But yet these people were battling out and standing up for themselves and, you know,
[00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:38.760]   terminated for whatever reason.
[00:55:38.760 --> 00:55:44.280]   And they get them easily $3.8 million to split up between them.
[00:55:44.280 --> 00:55:47.160]   I think that's utter crap from Google.
[00:55:47.160 --> 00:55:52.680]   Then I found this other story that I meant to put in the other day that came out from
[00:55:52.680 --> 00:55:59.800]   September of last year where Alpha that paid out was at $300 million or so because they're
[00:55:59.800 --> 00:56:03.840]   trying to fight off all of these allegations of wrongful determinations and things like
[00:56:03.840 --> 00:56:07.200]   that and it ended up with a $300 million settlement.
[00:56:07.200 --> 00:56:10.720]   And I'm thinking that's still, that's way better.
[00:56:10.720 --> 00:56:16.600]   But why did this $3.8 million just hit the fan and say that's the number for these people
[00:56:16.600 --> 00:56:22.520]   that are wrongfully terminated or discriminated against hit the job or even applying.
[00:56:22.520 --> 00:56:27.800]   For the job and was wrongfully discriminated against just because they're really gave
[00:56:27.800 --> 00:56:30.240]   up on them.
[00:56:30.240 --> 00:56:31.840]   The employees.
[00:56:31.840 --> 00:56:38.680]   Yeah, when you negotiate a settlement like that, what's happening is you're evaluating
[00:56:38.680 --> 00:56:42.960]   how much someone doesn't want it to go to court because of the weakness of their case
[00:56:42.960 --> 00:56:46.040]   versus the power that you might have.
[00:56:46.040 --> 00:56:48.800]   I mean, I'm not saying it's right at all.
[00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:49.800]   It's not.
[00:56:49.800 --> 00:56:50.800]   Yeah.
[00:56:50.800 --> 00:56:52.400]   There were a number of different groups.
[00:56:52.400 --> 00:56:59.440]   There was there were 2,565 female employees in engineering positions that were subject
[00:56:59.440 --> 00:57:01.160]   to pay discrimination.
[00:57:01.160 --> 00:57:04.920]   Google's going to give them 1.3 million in back pay.
[00:57:04.920 --> 00:57:07.160]   There were 1,757.
[00:57:07.160 --> 00:57:08.160]   Pardon me?
[00:57:08.160 --> 00:57:09.160]   Divided by how much?
[00:57:09.160 --> 00:57:10.880]   1.3 million divided by how much?
[00:57:10.880 --> 00:57:11.880]   2,565.
[00:57:11.880 --> 00:57:14.360]   Get your calculator out.
[00:57:14.360 --> 00:57:15.880]   What are we doing?
[00:57:15.880 --> 00:57:23.640]   That's 757 female and 1,219 Asian applicants who are not hired for software engineering positions.
[00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:28.600]   Google is going to pay 1.2 million dollars and then they're going to set up a cash reserve
[00:57:28.600 --> 00:57:34.040]   of one and a quarter million over the next five years for pay equity adjustments.
[00:57:34.040 --> 00:57:37.920]   Any excess money will go to the company's diversity and inclusion efforts.
[00:57:37.920 --> 00:57:42.160]   And of course, in this Google says that we don't admit that we did anything wrong.
[00:57:42.160 --> 00:57:43.160]   Of course.
[00:57:43.160 --> 00:57:50.480]   And we deny the allegations, but we are going to agree to do a better job in the future.
[00:57:50.480 --> 00:57:58.520]   Now I want to ask you, as a black gentleman, to compare what Google's doing in this regard
[00:57:58.520 --> 00:58:00.480]   with racial injustice and what Apple's doing.
[00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:03.800]   I'm just curious what your take is on this.
[00:58:03.800 --> 00:58:07.280]   Google is committing $12 million in grants to advance racial justice.
[00:58:07.280 --> 00:58:08.520]   This is the Google page.
[00:58:08.520 --> 00:58:11.680]   They're asking people to donate.
[00:58:11.680 --> 00:58:16.880]   These are the groups that they're donating to, which are all good groups.
[00:58:16.880 --> 00:58:23.000]   And then Apple's page, racial and equity and justice initiative for which they've committed
[00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:33.280]   more than $100 million, including some very concrete stuff like creating an education
[00:58:33.280 --> 00:58:36.880]   platform in Detroit, criminal justice reform, economic equality.
[00:58:36.880 --> 00:58:41.880]   Now don't judge it on the web page because clearly Apple won on the web design.
[00:58:41.880 --> 00:58:43.480]   I mean, that's obvious, right?
[00:58:43.480 --> 00:58:44.480]   That's what they do.
[00:58:44.480 --> 00:58:45.760]   Yeah, they're good at that.
[00:58:45.760 --> 00:58:48.320]   Clearly that Apple wins.
[00:58:48.320 --> 00:58:59.280]   I mean, compare this to Google's kind of Spartan, like, well, while we're using HTML, what
[00:58:59.280 --> 00:59:01.440]   do you want?
[00:59:01.440 --> 00:59:03.880]   Apple, you know, clearly.
[00:59:03.880 --> 00:59:06.360]   I also think Apple's really there.
[00:59:06.360 --> 00:59:09.840]   Here is they're working on STEM for girls.
[00:59:09.840 --> 00:59:13.960]   Apple developer Academy engineers support for Detroit entrepreneurs.
[00:59:13.960 --> 00:59:16.680]   They're going to do a bunch of in store.
[00:59:16.680 --> 00:59:18.280]   Well, I guess they don't do it in store anymore.
[00:59:18.280 --> 00:59:22.320]   They do it via Zoom or whatever, I guess, FaceTime, but they're going to do a bunch
[00:59:22.320 --> 00:59:28.400]   of educational things featuring black creators.
[00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:32.680]   On the one hand, I'm wondering if you look at this and go.
[00:59:32.680 --> 00:59:36.160]   It's cynically in Go Well, that's corporations.
[00:59:36.160 --> 00:59:41.080]   Or do you feel like one effort is maybe more impressive than the other or?
[00:59:41.080 --> 00:59:46.400]   Part of me is cynical where I say, well, corporations are just going to all of a sudden
[00:59:46.400 --> 00:59:47.400]   it's PR.
[00:59:47.400 --> 00:59:51.920]   Woke right now, especially right now, February of all months.
[00:59:51.920 --> 00:59:56.280]   But I also see that actions speak louder than words.
[00:59:56.280 --> 01:00:01.280]   And if you can have these conversations and raise awareness and then actually put some
[01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:04.520]   action behind it, then I'm all for it.
[01:00:04.520 --> 01:00:05.520]   Have at it.
[01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:06.520]   Keep doing it.
[01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:10.320]   Even if it is cynical PR's, but then it's all we do is just talk about it.
[01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:13.280]   What are we doing about it?
[01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:17.080]   They are doing products too, which I think is interesting because Apple is a product company.
[01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:25.480]   They have a black Unity watch band and new watch faces, which are available to everybody.
[01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:29.680]   They have new Apple Music channels, Rap Life Live.
[01:00:29.680 --> 01:00:32.880]   They have in maps, they have black owned restaurant guides.
[01:00:32.880 --> 01:00:38.640]   Amazon has done a similar thing with this Prime service and with this Prime Video service
[01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:45.560]   of raising awareness for people of color from the creativity standpoint, whether they wrote
[01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:48.240]   the movies or produced the movies or what have you.
[01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:51.000]   And there was a lot of stuff out there I had no idea about.
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:52.720]   That turned out to be fairly good.
[01:00:52.720 --> 01:00:57.080]   And then there was some things that just didn't resonate with me.
[01:00:57.080 --> 01:01:01.480]   But I did like the fact that these things got pushed up to the top a little bit to say,
[01:01:01.480 --> 01:01:04.160]   "Hey, check these other creators out as well."
[01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:09.000]   So that was a nice gesture and hopefully that will continue to happen when I open up the
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:14.480]   Amazon Prime app and not just something that's right now because it's a hot topic in a good
[01:01:14.480 --> 01:01:15.480]   PR push.
[01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:16.640]   Actually, I apologize.
[01:01:16.640 --> 01:01:23.320]   Google is committing $175 million to racial equity initiatives with a focus on black.
[01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:24.320]   This was back from last summer.
[01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:29.880]   I just missed it, focused on financing black owned businesses and supporting black entrepreneurs.
[01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:30.880]   So it's...
[01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:31.880]   However...
[01:01:31.880 --> 01:01:32.880]   Yeah.
[01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:34.880]   Two hundred young house.
[01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:37.960]   Two thousand five hundred sixty five female employees back pay and interest.
[01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:38.960]   Yeah.
[01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:41.080]   If I'm wrong here, five hundred six dollars each.
[01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:42.080]   Oh.
[01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:43.080]   Okay.
[01:01:43.080 --> 01:01:44.080]   That's what I say.
[01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:45.080]   Take care of your house first.
[01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:46.080]   Yeah.
[01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:47.080]   That's not good.
[01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:49.520]   That's not good.
[01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:54.000]   And of course, as you point out, Andy Rubin got a very fat golden parachute.
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:57.880]   Thirty million dollars to leave.
[01:01:57.880 --> 01:02:03.240]   Google's not been doing all that well, at least from the point of view of its public
[01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:04.840]   relations anyway.
[01:02:04.840 --> 01:02:06.840]   It sure doesn't look like the...
[01:02:06.840 --> 01:02:07.840]   I don't know.
[01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:08.840]   I don't know.
[01:02:08.840 --> 01:02:12.080]   There's none of us are stupid here on this panel.
[01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:17.720]   We know that PR is going to be PR because that's just how it operates.
[01:02:17.720 --> 01:02:21.560]   But again, just show me what you're doing.
[01:02:21.560 --> 01:02:27.880]   Let me see your actions in place, you know.
[01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:30.840]   Facebook's oversight board has overturned...
[01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:31.840]   This is good.
[01:02:31.840 --> 01:02:34.120]   There's some teeth in this.
[01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:37.440]   Overturned four cases in its first rulings.
[01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:38.720]   That's four out of five.
[01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:45.080]   And as we mentioned last week, they're going to be taking on the case of President Donald
[01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:48.200]   J. Trump being banned from Facebook.
[01:02:48.200 --> 01:02:50.200]   You won't wrote a piece on Medium.
[01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:53.040]   Come to judge.
[01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:55.080]   Nice.
[01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:56.080]   Yeah.
[01:02:56.080 --> 01:02:57.920]   Laughing, right?
[01:02:57.920 --> 01:02:58.920]   Yeah.
[01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:00.240]   As if Flip Wilson, who was it?
[01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:01.240]   Here comes a judge.
[01:03:01.240 --> 01:03:02.240]   Here comes a judge.
[01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:03.240]   Here comes a judge.
[01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:04.240]   Thank you.
[01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:06.360]   Only old people like us remember that.
[01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:10.160]   So what do you think of what Facebook's oversight board?
[01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:13.760]   So my smart-ass remark, which I also believe is that it makes Facebook's judgment look
[01:03:13.760 --> 01:03:17.640]   good.
[01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:19.720]   So they...
[01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:21.080]   And I blame Facebook for this as well.
[01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:26.000]   I blame both of them for it because Facebook gave them their statutes, their nitty-gritty
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:31.680]   community standards to judge from, or very high concepts like hate speech and human rights.
[01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:33.640]   So they read it rather literally.
[01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:37.720]   So an insult to Muslim men as a group.
[01:03:37.720 --> 01:03:39.520]   Oh, that doesn't rise to hate speech.
[01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:40.640]   They essentially leave it up.
[01:03:40.640 --> 01:03:42.600]   Well, how is the world better off with that?
[01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:51.440]   Well, the one that shocked me was a French post touting hydroxychloroquine, Donald Trump's
[01:03:51.440 --> 01:03:54.000]   favorite cure.
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:58.080]   They said it wasn't imminently harmful because you had to get a prescription to get it so
[01:03:58.080 --> 01:03:59.920]   you couldn't die tomorrow.
[01:03:59.920 --> 01:04:01.800]   So they put it up under freedom of speech.
[01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:09.960]   And my view is how is Facebook or the world better off for attacking Muslim men as a group
[01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:15.760]   and forcing Facebook to put back up medical disinformation?
[01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:17.840]   That's a really high bar, Jeff.
[01:04:17.840 --> 01:04:20.600]   How is the world better off by putting...
[01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:21.600]   Well...
[01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:23.800]   I publish stuff every day.
[01:04:23.800 --> 01:04:27.000]   If I ask myself, "How is the world better off?"
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:28.920]   I might be hard-pressed on...
[01:04:28.920 --> 01:04:30.640]   Well, Stacey, but this is not news.
[01:04:30.640 --> 01:04:31.640]   You publish news.
[01:04:31.640 --> 01:04:36.400]   This is a case where somebody put up medical misinformation where science has clearly spoken
[01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:42.120]   and the WHO and CDC have clearly spoken and the oversight board forces them to put it
[01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:43.120]   back up.
[01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:47.240]   And my standard here is it's not a governmental decision.
[01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:48.240]   It is a company.
[01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:49.920]   And at some point, there should be a standard.
[01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:53.760]   This is what I argue is they should have higher level principles that say if they had
[01:04:53.760 --> 01:04:58.000]   a higher level principle that said, "We want people to treat each other with respect,"
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:04:59.480]   then the Muslim post would have to go.
[01:04:59.480 --> 01:05:00.480]   But they don't have that.
[01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:01.480]   They have a statute.
[01:05:01.480 --> 01:05:06.360]   If they had a higher level principle as Monica Bicker at their head of content policy did
[01:05:06.360 --> 01:05:10.200]   say right after the decision is that they are going to keep going with science, the
[01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:11.920]   WHO and the CDC.
[01:05:11.920 --> 01:05:15.520]   If they had stated that as a policy, then the oversight board could have said, "According
[01:05:15.520 --> 01:05:18.160]   to this policy, this shouldn't be here."
[01:05:18.160 --> 01:05:21.840]   But instead, they just said, "Well, here's the nitty gritty of that statute, so we're
[01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:23.240]   going to put it back up.
[01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:25.160]   It just makes no sense to me."
[01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:28.480]   I mean, that seems like what it's designed to do.
[01:05:28.480 --> 01:05:34.520]   I mean, you have laws, not laws, but in the Facebook statutes.
[01:05:34.520 --> 01:05:37.960]   I mean, that's just the spirit and the letter of.
[01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:41.480]   Well, that's why I'm arguing they need higher level principles, which they don't have.
[01:05:41.480 --> 01:05:44.920]   You liked the oversight board when they appointed the people.
[01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:47.720]   You thought they were well chosen, right?
[01:05:47.720 --> 01:05:49.200]   Well, we'll see.
[01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:51.200]   You may not like their actions.
[01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:53.200]   Just like, I don't know about it now.
[01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:54.760]   Not so sure now.
[01:05:54.760 --> 01:06:01.120]   Because I think that there is a strong kind of libertarian view to it, which to its peril
[01:06:01.120 --> 01:06:02.600]   interprets this in a way.
[01:06:02.600 --> 01:06:03.680]   It says, "You have to come back."
[01:06:03.680 --> 01:06:10.360]   I still think that as a private company, they could have said, "Your policies are crappy.
[01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:15.440]   If we'd followed your policies to the letter, then you should keep up medical misinformation.
[01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:18.200]   But everybody's coming after you, and you say you're following science.
[01:06:18.200 --> 01:06:21.040]   So write a new policy, Bozos.
[01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:23.040]   That's what the oversight board should be doing.
[01:06:23.040 --> 01:06:29.480]   I feel like if I were an oversight board and you asked me to decide on things based on
[01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:35.120]   a certain rubric, I would say this rubric sucks.
[01:06:35.120 --> 01:06:38.920]   You could say that, but then Facebook is every right to say, "Well, then I don't want you
[01:06:38.920 --> 01:06:41.920]   on my oversight board because these are the rubrics we want you to follow."
[01:06:41.920 --> 01:06:45.680]   And then your choice then is to say, "I don't want to be part of this.
[01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:49.360]   You can write a nasty letter and publish it with everybody saying whatever."
[01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:54.760]   Isn't it the case, though, really, that this board has won an only one job, which is to
[01:06:54.760 --> 01:07:00.680]   let Mark Zuckerberg say, "Well, we're going to have the board handle that and defer responsibility."
[01:07:00.680 --> 01:07:02.480]   I have created this board.
[01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:03.840]   That seems to be what it is.
[01:07:03.840 --> 01:07:04.840]   Yeah.
[01:07:04.840 --> 01:07:05.840]   I have created this.
[01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:09.440]   I don't think Mark cares what the board rules on any of these individual things.
[01:07:09.440 --> 01:07:12.360]   If they overruled him every single time, I don't think he'd care.
[01:07:12.360 --> 01:07:17.440]   The board cannot review a meaningful number of cases.
[01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:19.440]   There are millions, probably billions.
[01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:20.440]   I don't know.
[01:07:20.440 --> 01:07:21.440]   There's a lot.
[01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:22.440]   Yeah.
[01:07:22.440 --> 01:07:26.400]   And they can only do a few at a time, take some 90 days to do it.
[01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:29.440]   This is a little, this is a tiniest amount.
[01:07:29.440 --> 01:07:33.680]   I think a lot of it is just, "Look, we got this oversight board and yes, I agree to be
[01:07:33.680 --> 01:07:37.480]   bound by the decision and these are very prestigious people.
[01:07:37.480 --> 01:07:39.400]   See, we care."
[01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:41.400]   It's pressure release for Mark Zuckerberg.
[01:07:41.400 --> 01:07:42.400]   Yeah.
[01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:43.400]   Yeah.
[01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:49.240]   So, at that point, the board did make higher policy suggestions saying, "This rule is
[01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:50.240]   pretty sucky.
[01:07:50.240 --> 01:07:51.240]   It's true.
[01:07:51.240 --> 01:07:52.240]   That rule is pretty vague."
[01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:53.240]   So, they did do that as well.
[01:07:53.240 --> 01:07:57.280]   But they're not, that's beyond their portfolio and Facebook doesn't have to do what they
[01:07:57.280 --> 01:07:58.920]   say there, right?
[01:07:58.920 --> 01:08:04.360]   So, somebody I know, in disclosure here, somebody I know was asked to put together a
[01:08:04.360 --> 01:08:10.440]   group of outsiders to talk about the Trump decision.
[01:08:10.440 --> 01:08:13.360]   So she invited me to be part of a group of, it's a 35 people for 90 days.
[01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:15.880]   I don't think we're going to be able to say much.
[01:08:15.880 --> 01:08:19.520]   But it'll be interesting to see the dynamics of that, where they wanted, they wanted outside
[01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:21.120]   input.
[01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:22.120]   I fear their Trump decision.
[01:08:22.120 --> 01:08:25.200]   I think their Trump decision- The over- oversight board wanted that.
[01:08:25.200 --> 01:08:27.920]   They'll just say, "Who asked for that board?"
[01:08:27.920 --> 01:08:28.920]   Sorry.
[01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:29.920]   "What was that board?"
[01:08:29.920 --> 01:08:30.920]   "The over-site board asked for that."
[01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:31.920]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:08:31.920 --> 01:08:32.920]   What was their idea to have asked?
[01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:33.920]   I was not asked.
[01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:36.400]   This kind of rump oversight board, what was the point of that?
[01:08:36.400 --> 01:08:39.600]   Well, no, the point is to have outside input.
[01:08:39.600 --> 01:08:41.200]   Oh, it's input for their decision.
[01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:42.200]   I see.
[01:08:42.200 --> 01:08:43.200]   Yes.
[01:08:43.200 --> 01:08:44.200]   Yes, yes, yes, yes.
[01:08:44.200 --> 01:08:48.280]   So I was not asked personally by the over-site board, the over-site board asked somebody who
[01:08:48.280 --> 01:08:49.280]   in turn asked me.
[01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:50.280]   Right.
[01:08:50.280 --> 01:08:54.240]   So it'll be interesting.
[01:08:54.240 --> 01:08:58.800]   Actually, at least here in the United States, their decision on Trump carries a lot more
[01:08:58.800 --> 01:09:00.600]   weight.
[01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:02.440]   I agree with you about the decisions they made.
[01:09:02.440 --> 01:09:05.000]   It seems a little odd.
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.680]   Maybe that's not the decision I would have made.
[01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:09.440]   But I also agree with you, Stacey.
[01:09:09.440 --> 01:09:14.120]   If they're rubric is based on what our terms of service are and you have to decide whether
[01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:18.800]   it violates our terms or not, then they maybe did exactly what they were supposed to do.
[01:09:18.800 --> 01:09:22.000]   I think it does show the way I think Stacey, you and I would agree here.
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:25.160]   I think it shows the weakness of Facebook's rules.
[01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:30.000]   As one friend of mine said, a journalist said, "They are not fit for purpose to be interpreted
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.480]   by a court of last resort.
[01:09:32.480 --> 01:09:36.800]   They're meant to tell a moderator and an author or other."
[01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:37.800]   Yes, that's correct.
[01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:42.920]   If the female nipple has a baby attached okay, but if it doesn't know...
[01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:46.080]   That was the one ruling they did overturn.
[01:09:46.080 --> 01:09:52.120]   Even though Facebook can already overturn itself.
[01:09:52.120 --> 01:09:53.960]   But again, I think that nobody really...
[01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:57.160]   Nobody at Facebook cares because that's not the real purpose of this.
[01:09:57.160 --> 01:10:01.760]   It's just to let it off with a little pressure.
[01:10:01.760 --> 01:10:03.760]   So I don't think they really care what they...
[01:10:03.760 --> 01:10:09.280]   And then, by the way, it may be that Mark secretly harbors a desire to put Trump back
[01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:13.360]   on because he drives a lot of engagement and a lot of revenue.
[01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:18.000]   And he's just figuring, "Well, if they make me do it, they made me do it.
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:19.280]   It wasn't my choice.
[01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:21.360]   Oversight board made me do it."
[01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:23.320]   And he might be satisfied with that result.
[01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:26.600]   See, where I think what I think is where it's going to go though, I think if you look
[01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:32.440]   at Australia where Facebook has threatened to take news off of Facebook...
[01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:34.640]   Keep Facebook there.
[01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:39.160]   But that users and publishers could not put news up on the platform.
[01:10:39.160 --> 01:10:43.920]   You look at the story that's next to the rundown that Facebook has developed a bad news avoidance
[01:10:43.920 --> 01:10:44.920]   for advertisers.
[01:10:44.920 --> 01:10:50.040]   It's not avoiding bad news.
[01:10:50.040 --> 01:10:52.360]   It's avoiding news that you don't want to be next to.
[01:10:52.360 --> 01:10:58.720]   This is a classic problem for advertisers on Twitter, on YouTube, and on Facebook because
[01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:02.400]   they could be next to something that they really don't want their ad next to.
[01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:03.400]   So why is it a bad tool?
[01:11:03.400 --> 01:11:04.400]   I think what I think you know is...
[01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:05.960]   No, I'm not saying it's a bad tool.
[01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:08.400]   What I'm saying is I think where Facebook...
[01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:12.280]   Well, it's bad for news because I think that what will happen is that...
[01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:13.280]   It'll drive...
[01:11:13.280 --> 01:11:14.280]   Abernathy Pambi...
[01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:16.040]   ...way it away and away and away.
[01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:21.560]   Now the advantage to Facebook is to take your cynical interpretation as normal, which
[01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:25.640]   I would agree with in this case, is I think Facebook would say, "Listen, guys, we got
[01:11:25.640 --> 01:11:27.440]   forced out of the news business.
[01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:28.440]   This news is a pain.
[01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:30.600]   We really don't make money on this stuff.
[01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:32.280]   We don't make money on this controversy.
[01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:34.000]   We spend a lot more on lobbying for it.
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:37.000]   We spend money on all these darned moderators.
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.200]   Fine, screw it.
[01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:40.800]   Pets and parties, pets and parties.
[01:11:40.800 --> 01:11:41.800]   That's what we are again."
[01:11:41.800 --> 01:11:43.320]   I don't think there's anything wrong with that.
[01:11:43.320 --> 01:11:45.160]   I'd love to see them do that.
[01:11:45.160 --> 01:11:49.560]   Well, but that doesn't help news in an informed society.
[01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:50.560]   Well, wait a minute.
[01:11:50.560 --> 01:11:51.560]   That's an interesting...
[01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:53.080]   Now here's an interesting conversation.
[01:11:53.080 --> 01:11:54.400]   You think Facebook's good for news?
[01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:57.000]   Oh, as opposed to every conversation we've had so far has not been interesting.
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:58.000]   No, it's not.
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:11:59.000]   Thank you very much.
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:00.000]   It's all been pretty dull, but...
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:01.000]   ...including the one I brought up.
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000]   Do you think Facebook is good for news?
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:04.000]   No, it's good for news.
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000]   Do you think Facebook is good for news?
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:07.000]   Yes.
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:13.880]   It inadvertently threw the side door, not through planning, not as well as it should be, but
[01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:22.080]   yes, when Facebook reduced news because of the disinformation controversies of the Trump
[01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:24.880]   years, news organizations were hurt.
[01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:25.880]   Yes.
[01:12:25.880 --> 01:12:28.440]   What if they didn't let you share?
[01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:33.720]   I mean, if it's a place for you to talk about things with people you know, right, it's the
[01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:38.800]   theory, a lot of what people talk about at the Water Cooler is, "Hey, did you see that
[01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:41.320]   story about that kitten who wrote a bicycle?"
[01:12:41.320 --> 01:12:45.400]   So it's news in the sense.
[01:12:45.400 --> 01:12:46.400]   I don't know.
[01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:50.880]   I mean, I'm trying to think of if you took news away from Facebook, so I, as a publisher,
[01:12:50.880 --> 01:12:56.240]   could not promote things there and people couldn't bring it in to talk about it.
[01:12:56.240 --> 01:12:58.360]   Is that the idea that would happen?
[01:12:58.360 --> 01:13:03.040]   I mean, then it just becomes almost irrelevant.
[01:13:03.040 --> 01:13:08.640]   Yeah, it does, but a lot of your life is not news.
[01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:11.200]   I mean, you know, we're news hounds us.
[01:13:11.200 --> 01:13:14.200]   We're crazy people.
[01:13:14.200 --> 01:13:17.120]   It's our business.
[01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:22.360]   Most people are not as obsessed with news as we might be.
[01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:24.720]   But turn around the other way.
[01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:28.840]   What occurred to me one day is that Facebook was definitely not built for news.
[01:13:28.840 --> 01:13:31.520]   Our readers took news here because I wanted to talk about it.
[01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:33.280]   Twitter was not built for news.
[01:13:33.280 --> 01:13:38.040]   Witnesses took it there because they wanted to share things that they saw, right?
[01:13:38.040 --> 01:13:42.200]   Next door is not built for news and newspapers should have built that so neighbors could talk,
[01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:43.200]   but we didn't.
[01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:44.200]   Next door did.
[01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:47.120]   So all the things that we lost out of the news business because we wanted to keep doing
[01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:48.120]   what we'd always done.
[01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:52.520]   No, I don't think a news organization could have built that.
[01:13:52.520 --> 01:13:54.040]   I kind of disagree.
[01:13:54.040 --> 01:13:59.000]   So I think there's an, if you have people who don't normally go to news sites because
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:03.480]   they're not that into news, I don't know if a news site could have created kind of a
[01:14:03.480 --> 01:14:08.600]   place like that, like for local communities to talk.
[01:14:08.600 --> 01:14:16.160]   I think what's, we're missing the third place online where you can come together with people
[01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:19.360]   and talk to them in a way that matters.
[01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:24.680]   And maybe for those platforms, you need to be authenticated and maybe use your real name,
[01:14:24.680 --> 01:14:27.880]   not everywhere on the internet because I'm very anti.
[01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:34.960]   But maybe if you step into next door, I don't know, your local newsy cafe, let's call it
[01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:37.480]   your local cafe.
[01:14:37.480 --> 01:14:41.920]   As long as you're who you say you are, you can say, Hey, I'm Stacey and I'm coming into
[01:14:41.920 --> 01:14:45.400]   the Austin local cafe because I used to live here and talk about things.
[01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:48.360]   But I also would be telling people that I no longer live there.
[01:14:48.360 --> 01:14:52.160]   So I couldn't argue about like school bond issues, right?
[01:14:52.160 --> 01:14:53.960]   Because I have no stake in that.
[01:14:53.960 --> 01:14:57.080]   I think that might be an interesting option for a base board.
[01:14:57.080 --> 01:14:58.080]   Next door.
[01:14:58.080 --> 01:15:01.600]   No, next door requires you to actually live in that geographic area.
[01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:02.600]   But you can talk about it.
[01:15:02.600 --> 01:15:04.400]   So next door is close.
[01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:07.000]   You want to, you want to be nosy in other neighborhoods, right?
[01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:08.560]   Well, it's not just nosy.
[01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:14.360]   Like when we talk about things like, if you don't live in that exact tiny area, but issues
[01:15:14.360 --> 01:15:18.840]   still affect that area, you do need to be able to talk about it with people outside that
[01:15:18.840 --> 01:15:23.120]   quote unquote neighborhood because there are state issues that might affect that neighborhood
[01:15:23.120 --> 01:15:27.880]   or there are citywide issues that are relevant.
[01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:32.280]   But when neighborhood is against something on another neighborhood, you see what I'm saying
[01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:33.280]   here?
[01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:36.800]   Yeah, you know, I get a lot of work on this when I ran local news sites where it's what
[01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:40.440]   I call the cinder block of local because in every market, the definition of local is
[01:15:40.440 --> 01:15:41.440]   different.
[01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:45.460]   And Cleveland is east side or west side in New Jersey, it's a county.
[01:15:45.460 --> 01:15:50.000]   In some places, it's a town in Louisiana, it's a parish in Alabama.
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:52.080]   It's three slices of the state.
[01:15:52.080 --> 01:15:54.320]   So every, every vision of local is different.
[01:15:54.320 --> 01:15:56.760]   Then you get to certain kinds of stories.
[01:15:56.760 --> 01:15:59.660]   Local is two square miles.
[01:15:59.660 --> 01:16:00.660]   Other kinds of stories.
[01:16:00.660 --> 01:16:02.680]   It's 100 square miles.
[01:16:02.680 --> 01:16:05.560]   And so the definition of local online is really actually new.
[01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:08.160]   Well, it's been complicated to present.
[01:16:08.160 --> 01:16:11.800]   I'm going to take a little break and then we're going to come back and talk about something
[01:16:11.800 --> 01:16:13.200]   else.
[01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:18.840]   And that's my promise to you as a podcaster.
[01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:19.840]   Our show.
[01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:20.840]   Thecaster promise.
[01:16:20.840 --> 01:16:22.840]   Podcast a promise.
[01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:23.840]   Picky swear.
[01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:29.240]   Our show today, Ronti by Nureva.
[01:16:29.240 --> 01:16:31.760]   You know, I'm a sound like Nazi.
[01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:36.880]   It's to me, video is great, but the sound is what matters.
[01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:43.040]   And I was really thrilled to talk to the engineers at Nureva about this really interesting technology
[01:16:43.040 --> 01:16:50.480]   designed to make your business meetings sound better, to improve meeting room audio.
[01:16:50.480 --> 01:16:53.240]   You know how it is most of the time you get one of those conference fun things in the
[01:16:53.240 --> 01:16:54.640]   middle of the table.
[01:16:54.640 --> 01:16:55.760]   Everybody sounds like their echo.
[01:16:55.760 --> 01:16:57.960]   You can't understand people at one end of the table.
[01:16:57.960 --> 01:16:58.960]   It's nasty.
[01:16:58.960 --> 01:16:59.960]   It's awful.
[01:16:59.960 --> 01:17:00.960]   It's terrible.
[01:17:00.960 --> 01:17:06.840]   Nureva is applying computational audio to meeting room sound.
[01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:13.480]   You know, you've seen how computational photography can take a terrible picture and make it amazing.
[01:17:13.480 --> 01:17:17.520]   That's what Nureva does with the sound in your conference room.
[01:17:17.520 --> 01:17:20.680]   When people are in a meeting space, especially nowadays, because you're distance, right?
[01:17:20.680 --> 01:17:22.440]   You're six feet from each other.
[01:17:22.440 --> 01:17:24.240]   So it's spread out even more.
[01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:27.480]   Conventional audio systems just can't handle that.
[01:17:27.480 --> 01:17:28.480]   Bean forming systems.
[01:17:28.480 --> 01:17:31.080]   Yeah, but that's not what Nureva is.
[01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:34.720]   And the problem with bean forming systems is they have to be adjusted and people have
[01:17:34.720 --> 01:17:38.360]   to sit in specific spots, not with Nureva.
[01:17:38.360 --> 01:17:42.480]   You don't have to add mics all over the table, which means sanitizing each mic in between
[01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:43.480]   meetings.
[01:17:43.480 --> 01:17:44.640]   Don't have to do that.
[01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:49.720]   You don't have to have your participates face any particular way or sit in any predetermined
[01:17:49.720 --> 01:17:50.720]   spot.
[01:17:50.720 --> 01:17:55.760]   They can go where it's natural, where they feel safe and still get great sound.
[01:17:55.760 --> 01:17:59.280]   The Nureva microphone hangs on the wall.
[01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:00.440]   It's easy to install.
[01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:02.320]   You can do it yourself.
[01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:07.920]   They use something, a patented system called microphone mist technology.
[01:18:07.920 --> 01:18:10.000]   It's actually amazing.
[01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:11.000]   I got a demo.
[01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:12.560]   I was so impressed.
[01:18:12.560 --> 01:18:17.440]   Essentially, this microphone on the wall, which looks kind of like a sound bar, fills
[01:18:17.440 --> 01:18:21.000]   the room with thousands of virtual microphones.
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:23.520]   And it does this computationally.
[01:18:23.520 --> 01:18:26.320]   So it's automatic, doesn't have to be adjusted or tuned.
[01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:27.680]   It's easy to set up.
[01:18:27.680 --> 01:18:29.800]   You'll get true full room coverage.
[01:18:29.800 --> 01:18:33.920]   So everybody everywhere in the room can be heard exactly the same as everybody else.
[01:18:33.920 --> 01:18:36.600]   Clearly, precisely, you can understand them.
[01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:40.320]   There's not room tone or echo, no matter where they sit, no matter how they're distanced,
[01:18:40.320 --> 01:18:42.720]   no matter where they face.
[01:18:42.720 --> 01:18:43.800]   You can install it.
[01:18:43.800 --> 01:18:45.960]   Just put it up on the wall.
[01:18:45.960 --> 01:18:48.720]   It automatically adapts to every room configuration.
[01:18:48.720 --> 01:18:51.800]   That's important because some meetings, there's going to be one person in there.
[01:18:51.800 --> 01:18:53.520]   Some meetings, there might be many more.
[01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:56.720]   And it'll adjust to who's in the room and where people are sitting.
[01:18:56.720 --> 01:18:58.000]   Four patents on this.
[01:18:58.000 --> 01:18:59.920]   It's really inspiring technology.
[01:18:59.920 --> 01:19:01.280]   Microphone missed.
[01:19:01.280 --> 01:19:02.600]   They've won numerous awards.
[01:19:02.600 --> 01:19:10.240]   Nureva's won the top new technology award at the ISE 2020 for the Nureva HDL 200 system.
[01:19:10.240 --> 01:19:11.600]   But the 200 is one of many.
[01:19:11.600 --> 01:19:16.080]   No matter the size of the room, you have a variety of systems for small, medium and
[01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:17.080]   large spaces.
[01:19:17.080 --> 01:19:19.480]   You should go to the website, nureva.com/twit.
[01:19:19.480 --> 01:19:21.120]   You can hear it for yourself.
[01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:22.280]   They use it at HubSpot.
[01:19:22.280 --> 01:19:24.200]   Jimmy Yan, who's there.
[01:19:24.200 --> 01:19:27.640]   I love his title, Principal Collaboration Engineer.
[01:19:27.640 --> 01:19:30.280]   He's the AV squad for your meeting room.
[01:19:30.280 --> 01:19:35.240]   He says, "We are so impressed with the sound quality, the ease of use, the ease of install
[01:19:35.240 --> 01:19:36.240]   of the HDL 300."
[01:19:36.240 --> 01:19:38.160]   They have the little bit bigger one.
[01:19:38.160 --> 01:19:41.040]   It was just a no-brainer for us to adopt it.
[01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:42.640]   It's incredible.
[01:19:42.640 --> 01:19:44.240]   And I want you to check it out.
[01:19:44.240 --> 01:19:49.200]   To learn more about Nureva audio as the simplest, cost-effective way to let your teams distance
[01:19:49.200 --> 01:19:51.680]   and meetings and still act and converse.
[01:19:51.680 --> 01:19:53.720]   Naturally, everybody can hear them.
[01:19:53.720 --> 01:19:59.400]   It's a no-rava N-U-R-E-V-A, nureva.com/twit.
[01:19:59.400 --> 01:20:05.960]   Nureva.com/twit, bringing computational audio to your meeting room.
[01:20:05.960 --> 01:20:07.440]   It's really clever.
[01:20:07.440 --> 01:20:09.160]   I was very impressed.
[01:20:09.160 --> 01:20:10.560]   Nureva.com/twit.
[01:20:10.560 --> 01:20:13.080]   Thank you to Riva for supporting Twig.
[01:20:13.080 --> 01:20:15.440]   Thank you for supporting us by using that special address.
[01:20:15.440 --> 01:20:18.400]   It's again, nureva.com/twit.
[01:20:18.400 --> 01:20:22.240]   TWIT TWIT.
[01:20:22.240 --> 01:20:29.360]   Jeff Bezos is moving on up to the chairmanship.
[01:20:29.360 --> 01:20:31.360]   He's going to spend more time with his money.
[01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:33.560]   Were you shocked when you saw this?
[01:20:33.560 --> 01:20:34.560]   Yeah, I saw--
[01:20:34.560 --> 01:20:35.560]   Woo!
[01:20:35.560 --> 01:20:36.560]   Amazon had a fan--
[01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:37.560]   Yeah, I thought it was a big deal, but--
[01:20:37.560 --> 01:20:39.200]   They had a fantastic quarter.
[01:20:39.200 --> 01:20:40.200]   Best ever.
[01:20:40.200 --> 01:20:41.200]   Mm-hmm.
[01:20:41.200 --> 01:20:42.200]   Thank you.
[01:20:42.200 --> 01:20:44.960]   If you had all that money, you finally dumped your wife.
[01:20:44.960 --> 01:20:45.960]   You got a hot bod.
[01:20:45.960 --> 01:20:48.160]   And would you want to deal with regulators?
[01:20:48.160 --> 01:20:49.160]   No.
[01:20:49.160 --> 01:20:50.160]   You want to go enjoy your interest.
[01:20:50.160 --> 01:20:51.160]   That would happen.
[01:20:51.160 --> 01:20:52.160]   You want to go into satellites?
[01:20:52.160 --> 01:20:53.160]   All right.
[01:20:53.160 --> 01:20:56.160]   You want to deal with the Washington Post?
[01:20:56.160 --> 01:20:57.160]   He's going to--
[01:20:57.160 --> 01:20:58.160]   Why would he?
[01:20:58.160 --> 01:21:03.360]   He's going to step down later this year, replacing himself with the head of Amazon Cloud, AWS,
[01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:05.960]   and he, Jassy, who's been with Amazon for a long, long time.
[01:21:05.960 --> 01:21:07.760]   Which says everything, doesn't it?
[01:21:07.760 --> 01:21:08.760]   Yeah, clouds where it is.
[01:21:08.760 --> 01:21:10.360]   There's not a retail company.
[01:21:10.360 --> 01:21:11.360]   Retail's gravy.
[01:21:11.360 --> 01:21:12.360]   Retail's a sideline.
[01:21:12.360 --> 01:21:14.520]   Retail's just a little bit of a thing we do for the--
[01:21:14.520 --> 01:21:15.520]   Ben.
[01:21:15.520 --> 01:21:19.320]   Ben Thompson's trajectory was really good on this.
[01:21:19.320 --> 01:21:24.640]   If you haven't read it yet, stratecary.com, then that's exactly it.
[01:21:24.640 --> 01:21:29.720]   He said Amazon's never been a retail company.
[01:21:29.720 --> 01:21:30.720]   And this just makes that--
[01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:33.960]   It's always been a data logistics company.
[01:21:33.960 --> 01:21:34.960]   Mm-hmm.
[01:21:34.960 --> 01:21:43.120]   I mean, Bezos said what-- he didn't say, what can I-- what problem can I solve?
[01:21:43.120 --> 01:21:48.520]   He said-- he said-- stratecary says Bezos started with the solution and looked for a problem.
[01:21:48.520 --> 01:21:51.720]   The solution broadly considered was the internet.
[01:21:51.720 --> 01:21:56.320]   And he said-- what business can only exist on the internet?
[01:21:56.320 --> 01:21:58.280]   So that there's no brick and mortar competition.
[01:21:58.280 --> 01:22:01.720]   He said selling books because there's 2 and 1/2 million books.
[01:22:01.720 --> 01:22:06.320]   The largest bookstore in the world can only hold 175,000 books.
[01:22:06.320 --> 01:22:11.320]   So there are actually over 3 million books worldwide in all languages.
[01:22:11.320 --> 01:22:15.280]   So he was able to get 2 and 1/2 million books in a virtual bookstore on the internet you
[01:22:15.280 --> 01:22:16.800]   couldn't compete with.
[01:22:16.800 --> 01:22:20.440]   He says, no, what's got the bookstore that big?
[01:22:20.440 --> 01:22:22.560]   But that was a logistics problem.
[01:22:22.560 --> 01:22:24.800]   It was a data problem.
[01:22:24.800 --> 01:22:26.240]   And obviously he's a genius.
[01:22:26.240 --> 01:22:29.880]   The question is whether Amazon can continue to succeed.
[01:22:29.880 --> 01:22:35.920]   Now I saw some people say, maybe even more cynical than Moi, that, oh, Jeff's still going
[01:22:35.920 --> 01:22:37.360]   to run the company.
[01:22:37.360 --> 01:22:44.640]   He's just now out of the eye of regulators, the SEC investors, all the people who are
[01:22:44.640 --> 01:22:48.560]   annoying so he can manipulate the levers behind the scenes.
[01:22:48.560 --> 01:22:53.840]   And Massey gets to sit in front of the cameras where Jeff I think has never been uncomfortable
[01:22:53.840 --> 01:22:55.840]   in front of the cameras.
[01:22:55.840 --> 01:22:57.640]   Does that-- do you think makes sense?
[01:22:57.640 --> 01:22:58.640]   Stacy?
[01:22:58.640 --> 01:22:59.640]   Yeah.
[01:22:59.640 --> 01:23:00.840]   Again, I would--
[01:23:00.840 --> 01:23:03.440]   Will he still run the place?
[01:23:03.440 --> 01:23:08.200]   I don't think he-- I don't really think he needs to.
[01:23:08.200 --> 01:23:13.000]   He's-- remember, up until the pandemic, he was pretty-- I don't want to say checked out,
[01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:16.000]   but he spent a lot of time doing strategic thinking.
[01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:17.000]   Right.
[01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.640]   And he hasn't wanted to do day to day.
[01:23:19.640 --> 01:23:20.640]   Yeah.
[01:23:20.640 --> 01:23:22.040]   And that pulled him back in.
[01:23:22.040 --> 01:23:26.640]   And if you look ahead and you're like, God, this regulatory quagmire's coming, geez.
[01:23:26.640 --> 01:23:29.040]   I mean, he-- take his money and run.
[01:23:29.040 --> 01:23:31.200]   He made a lot of money in the pandemic.
[01:23:31.200 --> 01:23:34.600]   His personal fortune went up significantly.
[01:23:34.600 --> 01:23:35.600]   So--
[01:23:35.600 --> 01:23:39.280]   He's going to spend it on space rockets and newspapers, I'm sure.
[01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:40.280]   Yeah.
[01:23:40.280 --> 01:23:42.520]   That's kind of what he said in his announcement.
[01:23:42.520 --> 01:23:45.360]   He said, I want to work on Blue Origin.
[01:23:45.360 --> 01:23:47.600]   I want to work on the Wall Street.
[01:23:47.600 --> 01:23:50.320]   I mean, the Washington-- whatever it is, the Post.
[01:23:50.320 --> 01:23:51.320]   The Post, right?
[01:23:51.320 --> 01:23:54.000]   Washington Post, thank you.
[01:23:54.000 --> 01:23:55.000]   He mentioned some other--
[01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:56.000]   Rag.
[01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:57.760]   Some other businesses that I didn't recognize.
[01:23:57.760 --> 01:23:59.480]   I guess a charitable enterprise.
[01:23:59.480 --> 01:24:01.840]   But here's the question.
[01:24:01.840 --> 01:24:07.840]   So is he like-- as a personality, is he like Larry and Sergey that they really have
[01:24:07.840 --> 01:24:10.920]   pulled back and they're fine, or is he going to keep his finger in?
[01:24:10.920 --> 01:24:11.920]   Well, that's interesting.
[01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:16.320]   Because I think you could make a case that Google has not been as Googly since they
[01:24:16.320 --> 01:24:18.200]   stepped aside, right?
[01:24:18.200 --> 01:24:24.120]   But Amazon has never-- Amazon has had wonderful processes, I would say.
[01:24:24.120 --> 01:24:30.960]   So I think Andy Jassy will do a good job in the infrastructure and the management layers
[01:24:30.960 --> 01:24:34.440]   around that have been built up over time.
[01:24:34.440 --> 01:24:36.560]   Amazon has a very distinct culture.
[01:24:36.560 --> 01:24:41.840]   And you don't stick with Amazon unless you buy into that culture.
[01:24:41.840 --> 01:24:47.720]   And so I don't think we'll see a huge deviation from--
[01:24:47.720 --> 01:24:49.480]   again, the culture.
[01:24:49.480 --> 01:24:54.160]   Well, as Ben Thompson points out, Jassy is not an engineer.
[01:24:54.160 --> 01:24:55.120]   He's a business guy.
[01:24:55.120 --> 01:24:56.640]   He's an MBA.
[01:24:56.640 --> 01:24:57.920]   As is Bezos.
[01:24:57.920 --> 01:25:00.160]   Bezos came from a hedge fund.
[01:25:00.160 --> 01:25:02.560]   So--
[01:25:02.560 --> 01:25:03.920]   And Jassy is legit.
[01:25:03.920 --> 01:25:04.880]   That'd be a nice move.
[01:25:04.880 --> 01:25:06.760]   He understands what's going on.
[01:25:06.760 --> 01:25:09.800]   He understands the Amazon business model.
[01:25:09.800 --> 01:25:12.400]   He is cold if he needs to be.
[01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:14.360]   And he will get stuff done.
[01:25:14.360 --> 01:25:16.240]   He's like Bezos in that sense.
[01:25:16.240 --> 01:25:18.880]   So should I keep my imaginary Amazon stock?
[01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:20.840]   Yes, keep your imaginary Amazon stock.
[01:25:20.840 --> 01:25:25.400]   Although this news should have no impact because really, we're just playing a big shell game.
[01:25:25.400 --> 01:25:29.000]   As we have agreed now, apparently.
[01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:30.320]   Does Amazon have a dividend?
[01:25:30.320 --> 01:25:30.880]   Hold up.
[01:25:30.880 --> 01:25:32.120]   Amazon probably does.
[01:25:32.120 --> 01:25:32.720]   I don't know.
[01:25:32.720 --> 01:25:34.080]   A lot of tech companies don't.
[01:25:34.080 --> 01:25:38.040]   Apple for a long time did not, but changed their tune.
[01:25:38.040 --> 01:25:39.000]   Never paid a dividend.
[01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:42.080]   And actually, Amazon usually runs close to--
[01:25:42.080 --> 01:25:43.200]   Nope, never.
[01:25:43.200 --> 01:25:45.920]   Yeah, they don't even try to make a profit a lot of times.
[01:25:45.920 --> 01:25:47.120]   That's right.
[01:25:47.120 --> 01:25:48.120]   Thank you.
[01:25:48.120 --> 01:25:53.320]   I was like, the words are escaping me, but making the strike thing.
[01:25:53.320 --> 01:25:58.840]   Amazon-- we should mention that at least halfway through the pandemic,
[01:25:58.840 --> 01:26:04.080]   Bezos was making $13 million an hour, which is slightly below minimum wage.
[01:26:04.080 --> 01:26:05.720]   Shouldn't it be $15 million for billionaires?
[01:26:05.720 --> 01:26:07.400]   I think it should be.
[01:26:07.400 --> 01:26:09.160]   Microsoft pays a dividend.
[01:26:09.160 --> 01:26:10.160]   Yeah.
[01:26:10.160 --> 01:26:11.160]   No.
[01:26:11.160 --> 01:26:12.160]   Old--
[01:26:12.160 --> 01:26:14.320]   Because Microsoft's an old company.
[01:26:14.320 --> 01:26:15.320]   Yeah.
[01:26:15.320 --> 01:26:17.400]   Apple-- traditionally, tech companies didn't.
[01:26:17.400 --> 01:26:21.600]   And then I think Apple and Microsoft and others started too because they realized we can't.
[01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:23.160]   There's a lot of reasons for it.
[01:26:23.160 --> 01:26:24.160]   A lot of pressure.
[01:26:24.160 --> 01:26:25.160]   Apple got kind of forced into it.
[01:26:25.160 --> 01:26:30.560]   Microsoft, I think, was more popular by having a dividend than it had been.
[01:26:30.560 --> 01:26:35.200]   As you said, that stock stayed at 35 or whatever for years.
[01:26:35.200 --> 01:26:36.200]   Yeah.
[01:26:36.200 --> 01:26:37.840]   Flat.
[01:26:37.840 --> 01:26:41.720]   And Amazon has really had a lot of control over how much money it makes and profit,
[01:26:41.720 --> 01:26:47.160]   which is I wonder if Amazon's incredible record quarter is partly because Jeff wanted
[01:26:47.160 --> 01:26:47.920]   to go out--
[01:26:47.920 --> 01:26:48.920]   Yeah.
[01:26:48.920 --> 01:26:50.920]   --and the blaze of glory.
[01:26:50.920 --> 01:26:51.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:26:51.920 --> 01:26:54.840]   Find me another billion, will you?
[01:26:54.840 --> 01:26:59.560]   They had a $100 billion quarter, $100 billion quarter.
[01:26:59.560 --> 01:27:02.040]   They are amassing more power during the pandemic.
[01:27:02.040 --> 01:27:07.680]   People, and they're taking greater control over their delivery infrastructure.
[01:27:07.680 --> 01:27:10.560]   And they're taking driver's tips, but they're paying a small--
[01:27:10.560 --> 01:27:11.560]   Oh, yeah.
[01:27:11.560 --> 01:27:12.560]   That was nasty.
[01:27:12.560 --> 01:27:14.560]   Well, that was an old story.
[01:27:14.560 --> 01:27:15.560]   It was a long way.
[01:27:15.560 --> 01:27:16.960]   I guess the find came out.
[01:27:16.960 --> 01:27:17.960]   Yeah.
[01:27:17.960 --> 01:27:18.960]   You got fined for that.
[01:27:18.960 --> 01:27:25.000]   Although, you got to point out, the guy's making $13 million a day.
[01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:26.000]   Yeah.
[01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:27.800]   But he's stiffening his employees.
[01:27:27.800 --> 01:27:29.360]   $61 million fine.
[01:27:29.360 --> 01:27:30.360]   Yeah.
[01:27:30.360 --> 01:27:32.360]   Yeah.
[01:27:32.360 --> 01:27:34.000]   That's part of the ethics that--
[01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:36.480]   Did you see O'Donnell?
[01:27:36.480 --> 01:27:37.480]   What's his name?
[01:27:37.480 --> 01:27:41.920]   Charlie O'Donnell's-- this was from January, and it's an excellent essay.
[01:27:41.920 --> 01:27:47.920]   And let's see if I can find it on Charlie O'Donnell in his sub stack.
[01:27:47.920 --> 01:27:50.400]   Give it a second.
[01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:51.560]   She's googling right now.
[01:27:51.560 --> 01:27:52.960]   Or is she binging?
[01:27:52.960 --> 01:27:53.960]   No one knows.
[01:27:53.960 --> 01:27:56.160]   Seed investments and insurrections.
[01:27:56.160 --> 01:27:57.160]   It's good.
[01:27:57.160 --> 01:27:58.160]   All right.
[01:27:58.160 --> 01:28:00.640]   I'm going to pop it into some place.
[01:28:00.640 --> 01:28:02.320]   I'm popping it in here.
[01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:05.760]   So this whole-- oh, I should pop it in the show notes.
[01:28:05.760 --> 01:28:06.760]   I'm bad.
[01:28:06.760 --> 01:28:07.560]   Is this from the--
[01:28:07.560 --> 01:28:10.520]   This is going to be big blog?
[01:28:10.520 --> 01:28:11.520]   Big.
[01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:16.480]   This is going to be big Charlie O'Donnell's blog on venture.
[01:28:16.480 --> 01:28:22.000]   So the idea here is as a venture investor, he's starting to ask questions about people
[01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:27.600]   saying things like, hey, we're going to make huge margins off of people making $10 an hour.
[01:28:27.600 --> 01:28:31.520]   And he's like, well, what happens if it's $15 an hour minimum wage?
[01:28:31.520 --> 01:28:36.840]   And then he's like, and hey, even if we don't say that's going to happen because of politics,
[01:28:36.840 --> 01:28:38.000]   do you think that's fair?
[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:45.160]   So he's saying that basically the tech industry needs to start, and the financial industry
[01:28:45.160 --> 01:28:51.800]   behind it, should maybe ask some questions about their culpability and the rise in inequality.
[01:28:51.800 --> 01:28:55.040]   There are two kinds of people in the world.
[01:28:55.040 --> 01:29:01.640]   There's people who believe in fairness, and then there's the very, very rich.
[01:29:01.640 --> 01:29:05.040]   I don't think they care about fair.
[01:29:05.040 --> 01:29:06.040]   It's like--
[01:29:06.040 --> 01:29:07.040]   Survival of the rich.
[01:29:07.040 --> 01:29:08.040]   But I'm rich.
[01:29:08.040 --> 01:29:09.280]   I don't have-- I won.
[01:29:09.280 --> 01:29:10.480]   I won.
[01:29:10.480 --> 01:29:19.520]   So unless I'm going to pay a penalty for mistreating my workers, I see no downside.
[01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:20.520]   Unless--
[01:29:20.520 --> 01:29:22.240]   I don't think people used to be that way.
[01:29:22.240 --> 01:29:26.520]   I think what's happened is as a culture, we've moved towards that.
[01:29:26.520 --> 01:29:31.080]   If you had told my grandfather or something like that, if you had made this argument to
[01:29:31.080 --> 01:29:37.360]   him and said, well, it'll be great because then my stockholders will be better off.
[01:29:37.360 --> 01:29:38.360]   Yeah, he's good.
[01:29:38.360 --> 01:29:39.360]   This is a myth.
[01:29:39.360 --> 01:29:44.360]   Yeah, he would be like, that is morally reprehensible.
[01:29:44.360 --> 01:29:49.120]   I mean, that's why I pay Kevin, for example.
[01:29:49.120 --> 01:29:53.600]   And that's why I pay anybody who writes for me as much as I can, which is--
[01:29:53.600 --> 01:29:54.600]   Let me show you this.
[01:29:54.600 --> 01:29:58.360]   This is-- if you read Jonathan Hates' book or Hites' book, he's like, I don't want to
[01:29:58.360 --> 01:29:59.360]   call him Hates.
[01:29:59.360 --> 01:30:00.640]   Really good book.
[01:30:00.640 --> 01:30:02.520]   He is a sociologist.
[01:30:02.520 --> 01:30:08.800]   You know the book probably, Jeff, because it's maybe more up your alley.
[01:30:08.800 --> 01:30:11.520]   But I've interviewed him on the triangulation.
[01:30:11.520 --> 01:30:22.720]   He talks about liberals versus conservatives and what values they-- there's five values,
[01:30:22.720 --> 01:30:25.160]   harm, fairness, authority, in-group impurity.
[01:30:25.160 --> 01:30:28.920]   And he has much more detailed definitions.
[01:30:28.920 --> 01:30:37.560]   But liberals tend to value-- their values are in the harm and fairness scale, higher.
[01:30:37.560 --> 01:30:43.560]   Conservatives tend to have higher value for authority in-group purity.
[01:30:43.560 --> 01:30:48.840]   And he is, by the way, saying this in a very non-judgmental way.
[01:30:48.840 --> 01:30:51.200]   In fact, if you're a liberal, you look at it and go, those stupid conservatives.
[01:30:51.200 --> 01:30:53.280]   If you're a conservative, you go, those stupid liberals.
[01:30:53.280 --> 01:30:57.240]   But he is looking at it in a very different way.
[01:30:57.240 --> 01:31:03.280]   He says, if we're ever going to understand each other, we have to understand these five
[01:31:03.280 --> 01:31:08.760]   values and why the guy across the table, while disagreeing with so vehemently, it's just
[01:31:08.760 --> 01:31:14.320]   because he values a different set of those five, higher.
[01:31:14.320 --> 01:31:16.560]   It's actually very interesting.
[01:31:16.560 --> 01:31:21.040]   He's done a lot of research and work around this.
[01:31:21.040 --> 01:31:25.160]   The Righteous Mind is his book, which I highly recommend.
[01:31:25.160 --> 01:31:30.040]   But his point is-- and this is the point I was making-- I agree with you, Stacey.
[01:31:30.040 --> 01:31:32.160]   Fairness is important.
[01:31:32.160 --> 01:31:33.160]   It's really important.
[01:31:33.160 --> 01:31:34.160]   We want to be fair.
[01:31:34.160 --> 01:31:36.640]   But not everybody feels that way.
[01:31:36.640 --> 01:31:41.960]   I think, though, fairness is also important for the growth of society.
[01:31:41.960 --> 01:31:47.960]   Even if you're selfishly concerned about your own happiness, it's actually good for that,
[01:31:47.960 --> 01:31:51.520]   too, because it creates a more equitable society.
[01:31:51.520 --> 01:31:56.040]   It's a society that is calmer, has less random shootings.
[01:31:56.040 --> 01:31:57.560]   Well, of course you'd think that.
[01:31:57.560 --> 01:31:58.720]   You're at lower risk.
[01:31:58.720 --> 01:32:00.440]   You're on that liberal side.
[01:32:00.440 --> 01:32:02.400]   Of course you'd think that.
[01:32:02.400 --> 01:32:04.800]   And then other people think, you know what?
[01:32:04.800 --> 01:32:10.960]   If we honor traditional values, there are things that we would do that would be better.
[01:32:10.960 --> 01:32:15.600]   And by the way, his point is, nobody's-- these are autonomic processes.
[01:32:15.600 --> 01:32:16.600]   Oh, yeah.
[01:32:16.600 --> 01:32:20.160]   I mean, this is like when we talk about the difference between the US and China.
[01:32:20.160 --> 01:32:21.160]   We're talking about cultural--
[01:32:21.160 --> 01:32:22.720]   Fundamental cultural differences.
[01:32:22.720 --> 01:32:24.320]   --completely different things.
[01:32:24.320 --> 01:32:25.320]   Yeah.
[01:32:25.320 --> 01:32:26.320]   Yeah.
[01:32:26.320 --> 01:32:27.320]   So it's a good book.
[01:32:27.320 --> 01:32:28.320]   I highly recommend it.
[01:32:28.320 --> 01:32:30.520]   It certainly opened my mind.
[01:32:30.520 --> 01:32:36.040]   The righteous mind, while good people are divided by politics and religion.
[01:32:36.040 --> 01:32:40.040]   And it's helped me to kind of understand the other side a little bit better because
[01:32:40.040 --> 01:32:41.760]   they're going, oh, yeah.
[01:32:41.760 --> 01:32:44.760]   Because their values are slightly different than my value.
[01:32:44.760 --> 01:32:45.760]   Well, this is--
[01:32:45.760 --> 01:32:48.920]   Liberals tend to put fairness above all else, right?
[01:32:48.920 --> 01:32:49.920]   Right.
[01:32:49.920 --> 01:32:53.520]   It's also kind of-- there are circumstances, too.
[01:32:53.520 --> 01:33:01.400]   There's this data boy's argument in the epistemological war is that we have to start-- it's not so much
[01:33:01.400 --> 01:33:02.680]   teaching each other facts.
[01:33:02.680 --> 01:33:04.240]   It's teaching each other about each other.
[01:33:04.240 --> 01:33:05.240]   Yeah.
[01:33:05.240 --> 01:33:06.240]   Right.
[01:33:06.240 --> 01:33:07.240]   We all get the same--
[01:33:07.240 --> 01:33:08.240]   You should never use the word epistem-- epistemology.
[01:33:08.240 --> 01:33:09.240]   --pistemology.
[01:33:09.240 --> 01:33:10.240]   Thank you.
[01:33:10.240 --> 01:33:11.240]   Thank you.
[01:33:11.240 --> 01:33:12.240]   I've heard that.
[01:33:12.240 --> 01:33:13.240]   Use epistemology in a sentence.
[01:33:13.240 --> 01:33:15.560]   No, I mean, I know the word.
[01:33:15.560 --> 01:33:18.400]   I'm just like-- we have jumped the shark right there.
[01:33:18.400 --> 01:33:19.400]   We're like, nope.
[01:33:19.400 --> 01:33:21.040]   We're a tech one.
[01:33:21.040 --> 01:33:25.520]   My only point was while you and I and maybe everybody on this panel would agree, oh, yeah,
[01:33:25.520 --> 01:33:30.040]   we should consider fairness the fairness of a billionaire making $13 million a day while
[01:33:30.040 --> 01:33:33.520]   paying minimum wage to the people who make him that money.
[01:33:33.520 --> 01:33:36.520]   But I don't know if that necessarily is a universally helpful--
[01:33:36.520 --> 01:33:38.760]   You don't even have to look at that as fairness.
[01:33:38.760 --> 01:33:44.640]   You could even-- I mean, on that chart, what was it?
[01:33:44.640 --> 01:33:46.480]   Authority, purity, and the third one?
[01:33:46.480 --> 01:33:47.480]   Yeah.
[01:33:47.480 --> 01:33:49.240]   That really is reductionist that chart, I'm afraid.
[01:33:49.240 --> 01:33:51.800]   I shouldn't have done it.
[01:33:51.800 --> 01:33:54.520]   Loyalty, authority, and sanctity.
[01:33:54.520 --> 01:33:56.000]   Loyalty, I mean--
[01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:57.000]   Sanctity.
[01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:01.280]   Well, you could argue-- I mean, there's a lot in the Bible.
[01:34:01.280 --> 01:34:10.720]   And you could argue loyalty to your fellow man argues that you would not treat someone
[01:34:10.720 --> 01:34:11.720]   like that.
[01:34:11.720 --> 01:34:15.520]   Yeah, it's not that conservatives don't believe in fairness.
[01:34:15.520 --> 01:34:19.560]   But they don't weigh it as highly as liberals might.
[01:34:19.560 --> 01:34:20.080]   I don't know.
[01:34:20.080 --> 01:34:21.560]   It might be reductionist.
[01:34:21.560 --> 01:34:24.240]   I don't know if you-- like, I don't want to say that it's unfair.
[01:34:24.240 --> 01:34:28.360]   Like, to me, it's less an issue of fairness.
[01:34:28.360 --> 01:34:31.800]   The big moral issue here--
[01:34:31.800 --> 01:34:33.160]   I mean, it is unfair.
[01:34:33.160 --> 01:34:40.520]   But is that when you have something that's so obviously skewed, you have people who are
[01:34:40.520 --> 01:34:44.840]   able to utterly take advantage of the people underneath them.
[01:34:44.840 --> 01:34:46.320]   And those people have no recourse.
[01:34:46.320 --> 01:34:47.920]   So it's basically abusing power.
[01:34:47.920 --> 01:34:50.480]   I completely agree with you.
[01:34:50.480 --> 01:34:56.240]   That's why I said Bezos makes $13 million an hour while his employees that are making
[01:34:56.240 --> 01:35:01.800]   him this fortune are making less than $15 an hour.
[01:35:01.800 --> 01:35:05.120]   And that's really kind of been the story of Big Tech and the pandemic.
[01:35:05.120 --> 01:35:08.480]   It's been very, very profitable for them.
[01:35:08.480 --> 01:35:13.520]   So that's another cynical angle to the Bezos story, too, is that he can't top this now.
[01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:16.120]   So whoever follows them is going to look bad by comparison.
[01:35:16.120 --> 01:35:16.640]   Yeah.
[01:35:16.640 --> 01:35:21.000]   I think that kind of ties in with Amazon's giant quarter.
[01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:24.000]   It's like, good luck.
[01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:25.240]   Have a fun.
[01:35:25.240 --> 01:35:28.520]   Here's the keys.
[01:35:28.520 --> 01:35:29.760]   We'll see.
[01:35:29.760 --> 01:35:32.880]   Bezos is a fascinating fella.
[01:35:32.880 --> 01:35:35.600]   I've always watched him with great interest.
[01:35:35.600 --> 01:35:38.480]   I've read "Bradstone's Great Book, The Everything Store."
[01:35:38.480 --> 01:35:40.240]   Highly recommend that.
[01:35:40.240 --> 01:35:42.960]   I wish there were more, actually, about Bezos.
[01:35:42.960 --> 01:35:46.920]   Read Ben Thompson's article today in Stratecari, because that was a good one.
[01:35:46.920 --> 01:35:50.600]   By the way, it's Blue Origin, his space project.
[01:35:50.600 --> 01:35:53.000]   The Washington Post's his newspaper.
[01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:58.040]   The Bezos Earth Fund and the Day One Fund.
[01:35:58.040 --> 01:36:00.880]   Those are the things he wants to devote his time to.
[01:36:00.880 --> 01:36:04.480]   The Washington Post, by the way, is going to get a new editor, immediately.
[01:36:04.480 --> 01:36:06.480]   The brilliant Marty Barron has announced his--
[01:36:06.480 --> 01:36:07.480]   Oh, no, really?
[01:36:07.480 --> 01:36:09.760]   Oh, that's too bad.
[01:36:09.760 --> 01:36:16.200]   Speaking of CEO movement, the Mercer family, Rebecca Mercer, has decided to kick John
[01:36:16.200 --> 01:36:19.520]   Mazzie out at Parler.
[01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:23.800]   Parler CEO John Mazzie says he's been terminated by the board, quote, "I did not participate
[01:36:23.800 --> 01:36:28.120]   in this decision."
[01:36:28.120 --> 01:36:35.240]   This is being seen as Rebecca Mercer taking the reins and saying, all right, we're going
[01:36:35.240 --> 01:36:36.720]   to get this thing together.
[01:36:36.720 --> 01:36:39.680]   It's kind of related because this--
[01:36:39.680 --> 01:36:41.840]   It's the Mercer's.
[01:36:41.840 --> 01:36:43.400]   It's the Mercer's.
[01:36:43.400 --> 01:36:44.400]   It's all that matters.
[01:36:44.400 --> 01:36:45.400]   It's the Mercer's.
[01:36:45.400 --> 01:36:46.400]   I can't.
[01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:47.400]   No.
[01:36:47.400 --> 01:36:48.720]   It's the Mercer's social network.
[01:36:48.720 --> 01:36:52.000]   We just live here.
[01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:57.720]   I don't know if that'll get him back on the internet, but--
[01:36:57.720 --> 01:36:59.680]   I'm delighted.
[01:36:59.680 --> 01:37:04.240]   I just caught Stacy catching me tweeting during the show.
[01:37:04.240 --> 01:37:11.240]   Steven Sinofsky, former-- and much hated Microsoft's executive, the guy in charge of-- what was
[01:37:11.240 --> 01:37:12.240]   it?
[01:37:12.240 --> 01:37:19.440]   Windows 8 has decided to write his memoirs, but on sub-stack.
[01:37:19.440 --> 01:37:21.760]   How cool can you be?
[01:37:21.760 --> 01:37:23.800]   He's a cool kid.
[01:37:23.800 --> 01:37:28.560]   Hardware-- I mean, sorry, hardcore software inside the rise and fall of the PC revolution,
[01:37:28.560 --> 01:37:31.240]   which would be he confesses at least two volume sets.
[01:37:31.240 --> 01:37:32.600]   So he's got a lot of running to do.
[01:37:32.600 --> 01:37:38.160]   He's going to serialize it as a set of posts on sub-stack.
[01:37:38.160 --> 01:37:45.120]   Chapter 001-- that's a bad sign that he feels like he's going to need three digits.
[01:37:45.120 --> 01:37:46.120]   Becoming a Microsofty.
[01:37:46.120 --> 01:37:48.160]   At least it's not 1.1.
[01:37:48.160 --> 01:37:50.000]   Yeah.
[01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:55.120]   This book is broken into 15 chapters in an epilogue each chapter as an-- you know, that's
[01:37:55.120 --> 01:37:56.120]   the plan.
[01:37:56.120 --> 01:37:57.120]   We'll see what happens.
[01:37:57.120 --> 01:37:58.440]   Hey, guess what?
[01:37:58.440 --> 01:38:02.440]   It's time for the Google change log.
[01:38:02.440 --> 01:38:07.960]   The Google change log.
[01:38:07.960 --> 01:38:11.720]   February security patches rolling out to the Google Pixel.
[01:38:11.720 --> 01:38:13.520]   Why am I having trouble saying Google?
[01:38:13.520 --> 01:38:14.920]   I don't know.
[01:38:14.920 --> 01:38:16.760]   Factory images and OTAs are live.
[01:38:16.760 --> 01:38:22.920]   That's usually the first-- the herald-- like the Robin heralding spring, the OTA images
[01:38:22.920 --> 01:38:26.280]   herald, the new security patch for--
[01:38:26.280 --> 01:38:27.520]   It's a pretty boring story.
[01:38:27.520 --> 01:38:28.920]   We get that every month.
[01:38:28.920 --> 01:38:29.920]   Yeah.
[01:38:29.920 --> 01:38:30.920]   You know what?
[01:38:30.920 --> 01:38:32.360]   Jason Howell is the host of All About Android.
[01:38:32.360 --> 01:38:34.360]   I think he stuck that in here.
[01:38:34.360 --> 01:38:35.360]   Oh, OK.
[01:38:35.360 --> 01:38:36.360]   All right, Jason.
[01:38:36.360 --> 01:38:37.360]   That's OK.
[01:38:37.360 --> 01:38:38.920]   He still produces the show, right?
[01:38:38.920 --> 01:38:39.920]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:38:39.920 --> 01:38:40.920]   Pixel 5.
[01:38:40.920 --> 01:38:41.920]   Yeah.
[01:38:41.920 --> 01:38:42.920]   He gets to do that.
[01:38:42.920 --> 01:38:43.920]   That's his job.
[01:38:43.920 --> 01:38:49.840]   Pixel 5 for a 5G now supports standalone 5G on T-Mobile and Google 5 with the February
[01:38:49.840 --> 01:38:50.840]   update.
[01:38:50.840 --> 01:38:55.280]   Another exciting February update story.
[01:38:55.280 --> 01:38:56.280]   Let's see if I can find something.
[01:38:56.280 --> 01:38:59.680]   Oh, there's a green room now in Google Meet.
[01:38:59.680 --> 01:39:05.360]   So this is actually much needed to test your audio in your video.
[01:39:05.360 --> 01:39:11.640]   It shows you a picture of yourself and you can decide not to wear that knit cap.
[01:39:11.640 --> 01:39:14.280]   And then it says, "Say something."
[01:39:14.280 --> 01:39:17.160]   And I'm just testing my video and then it plays it back to you.
[01:39:17.160 --> 01:39:18.160]   That's a very good idea.
[01:39:18.160 --> 01:39:20.400]   And magically, there are doughnuts and coffee there.
[01:39:20.400 --> 01:39:21.400]   It's amazing.
[01:39:21.400 --> 01:39:23.120]   Oh, I wish in the green room.
[01:39:23.120 --> 01:39:24.280]   What's the best green room?
[01:39:24.280 --> 01:39:25.280]   The only red M&M's.
[01:39:25.280 --> 01:39:28.800]   You ever experienced best food?
[01:39:28.800 --> 01:39:31.880]   I've been in crappy, crappy green rooms every time.
[01:39:31.880 --> 01:39:38.280]   MSNBC had Dunkin' Donuts coffee and Dunkin' Donuts donuts.
[01:39:38.280 --> 01:39:40.120]   Yeah, they didn't have...
[01:39:40.120 --> 01:39:42.240]   Regis and Kelly was not a great green room.
[01:39:42.240 --> 01:39:43.800]   It was OK, but it wasn't great.
[01:39:43.800 --> 01:39:47.040]   You know the best one I've been in was the Today Show.
[01:39:47.040 --> 01:39:48.040]   That was pretty nice.
[01:39:48.040 --> 01:39:49.040]   They had eggs.
[01:39:49.040 --> 01:39:50.040]   They had breakfast.
[01:39:50.040 --> 01:39:51.040]   They had breakfast.
[01:39:51.040 --> 01:39:52.040]   But you were up pretty early.
[01:39:52.040 --> 01:39:53.040]   Isn't that right?
[01:39:53.040 --> 01:39:54.040]   It's like it's 6 in the morning, right?
[01:39:54.040 --> 01:39:56.040]   Yeah, I think they had to.
[01:39:56.040 --> 01:39:58.040]   I think they had to.
[01:39:58.040 --> 01:39:59.040]   Yeah.
[01:39:59.040 --> 01:40:03.320]   I think the best one I've been in was on a 1351 Redwood way.
[01:40:03.320 --> 01:40:04.320]   We have an excellent green room.
[01:40:04.320 --> 01:40:05.320]   I have some coffee.
[01:40:05.320 --> 01:40:07.320]   He likes our coffee machine.
[01:40:07.320 --> 01:40:09.480]   He keeps telling me...
[01:40:09.480 --> 01:40:12.240]   I have also an excellent green room.
[01:40:12.240 --> 01:40:13.240]   What's your favorite green room?
[01:40:13.240 --> 01:40:14.240]   Yours?
[01:40:14.240 --> 01:40:15.240]   I have a...
[01:40:15.240 --> 01:40:16.240]   The best cookies.
[01:40:16.240 --> 01:40:17.240]   Google...
[01:40:17.240 --> 01:40:18.240]   I have a...
[01:40:18.240 --> 01:40:22.880]   Google search links are going to get a panel that says about this result that will give
[01:40:22.880 --> 01:40:28.520]   you information about the website, which is kind of an interesting idea.
[01:40:28.520 --> 01:40:30.840]   Here's how it looks.
[01:40:30.840 --> 01:40:33.640]   So this is so you can vet the source.
[01:40:33.640 --> 01:40:34.640]   So in this example...
[01:40:34.640 --> 01:40:36.160]   Facebook has been doing for like two years.
[01:40:36.160 --> 01:40:37.160]   Have they really?
[01:40:37.160 --> 01:40:40.600]   They don't find a huge uptake for it, but that's a different experience.
[01:40:40.600 --> 01:40:41.600]   This might...
[01:40:41.600 --> 01:40:42.600]   People might use this.
[01:40:42.600 --> 01:40:43.600]   I don't know.
[01:40:43.600 --> 01:40:44.600]   I see.
[01:40:44.600 --> 01:40:50.880]   So in this example that they give, you see an article from the Lancet and it says the
[01:40:50.880 --> 01:40:53.480]   Lancet is a weekly peer reviewed general medical journal.
[01:40:53.480 --> 01:40:56.960]   It's among the world's oldest and best known general medical journals.
[01:40:56.960 --> 01:40:57.960]   That's from Wikipedia.
[01:40:57.960 --> 01:41:00.240]   It says your site is secure.
[01:41:00.240 --> 01:41:06.160]   It shows you the full URL of the article, which is sometimes really nice to see ahead
[01:41:06.160 --> 01:41:07.200]   of time.
[01:41:07.200 --> 01:41:09.400]   This is a search result, not an ad.
[01:41:09.400 --> 01:41:13.960]   Only ads are paid and they'll always be labeled with sponsored or ad.
[01:41:13.960 --> 01:41:14.960]   And I think that's really cool.
[01:41:14.960 --> 01:41:18.960]   There's in them buttons at the bottom with the privacy settings and how search works.
[01:41:18.960 --> 01:41:20.760]   I think this is nice.
[01:41:20.760 --> 01:41:21.760]   This seems...
[01:41:21.760 --> 01:41:24.920]   I guess it's only on mobile.
[01:41:24.920 --> 01:41:27.720]   It's a beta feature rolling out to Google search in the US.
[01:41:27.720 --> 01:41:32.480]   Oh no, desktop mobile web and the Google app on Android.
[01:41:32.480 --> 01:41:34.120]   I like it.
[01:41:34.120 --> 01:41:38.720]   YouTube is going to celebrate Black History Month, the month of February.
[01:41:38.720 --> 01:41:43.080]   There'll be a new BHM logo every week on...
[01:41:43.080 --> 01:41:47.040]   I presume leading to BHM content, I don't know.
[01:41:47.040 --> 01:41:48.040]   I would...
[01:41:48.040 --> 01:41:49.760]   I would guess.
[01:41:49.760 --> 01:41:53.720]   YouTube says at YouTube, we believe in the power of diverse voices and perspectives as
[01:41:53.720 --> 01:41:57.040]   part of our continuing work to support and celebrate these voices.
[01:41:57.040 --> 01:42:02.120]   We're starting Black History Month by highlighting four Black artists this Black History Month.
[01:42:02.120 --> 01:42:07.800]   They will bring their creative talents to the YouTube logo.
[01:42:07.800 --> 01:42:09.600]   Every Monday and February, there'll be a new logo.
[01:42:09.600 --> 01:42:14.600]   So there's only going to be four in the top left corner of the home feed.
[01:42:14.600 --> 01:42:15.600]   Now I'm going to...
[01:42:15.600 --> 01:42:16.600]   Should I try it?
[01:42:16.600 --> 01:42:17.600]   YouTube.
[01:42:17.600 --> 01:42:18.600]   Let's go.
[01:42:18.600 --> 01:42:19.600]   Let's see.
[01:42:19.600 --> 01:42:20.600]   BHM logo.
[01:42:20.600 --> 01:42:21.600]   I don't see one.
[01:42:21.600 --> 01:42:24.640]   I want to say I saw it earlier today.
[01:42:24.640 --> 01:42:27.440]   Do I have to play a video to see it?
[01:42:27.440 --> 01:42:29.360]   No, it's not working.
[01:42:29.360 --> 01:42:31.640]   Is it because I'm premium?
[01:42:31.640 --> 01:42:34.840]   No, they wouldn't only show that to people who don't pay.
[01:42:34.840 --> 01:42:36.640]   I guess I'm just not getting it yet.
[01:42:36.640 --> 01:42:37.640]   I saw it on...
[01:42:37.640 --> 01:42:39.440]   Well, maybe it was my other computer.
[01:42:39.440 --> 01:42:41.840]   I don't know, but I saw it on something earlier today.
[01:42:41.840 --> 01:42:42.960]   I don't see it on this screen.
[01:42:42.960 --> 01:42:44.880]   Maybe I do have ad blocking turned on.
[01:42:44.880 --> 01:42:47.280]   Let's refresh and see.
[01:42:47.280 --> 01:42:48.280]   No.
[01:42:48.280 --> 01:42:50.000]   I don't know.
[01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:52.120]   Anyway, look for it.
[01:42:52.120 --> 01:42:57.360]   Google Play is going to allow Android gambling and betting apps in more countries, including
[01:42:57.360 --> 01:42:59.760]   the good old USA.
[01:42:59.760 --> 01:43:02.760]   So Robinhood is just going to fit right in.
[01:43:02.760 --> 01:43:08.200]   No, I'm kidding.
[01:43:08.200 --> 01:43:12.280]   We're updating our real money gambling games and contest policy so more developers can
[01:43:12.280 --> 01:43:16.080]   build sustainable businesses on your addictions.
[01:43:16.080 --> 01:43:18.480]   In a way that helps keep consumers safe.
[01:43:18.480 --> 01:43:21.760]   Hey, insurance companies are just legalized gambling.
[01:43:21.760 --> 01:43:22.760]   That's true.
[01:43:22.760 --> 01:43:23.760]   It's all gambling.
[01:43:23.760 --> 01:43:24.760]   Why not?
[01:43:24.760 --> 01:43:25.760]   Yeah.
[01:43:25.760 --> 01:43:28.760]   DraftKings is going to bring its sports book and casino app to the US.
[01:43:28.760 --> 01:43:34.600]   There's online casino games permitted in Delaware, Nevada, New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
[01:43:34.600 --> 01:43:35.680]   Congratulations, Jeff.
[01:43:35.680 --> 01:43:36.680]   You win.
[01:43:36.680 --> 01:43:38.240]   There'll be sports betting.
[01:43:38.240 --> 01:43:41.040]   We're losing for gambling now.
[01:43:41.040 --> 01:43:42.040]   Nonstop.
[01:43:42.040 --> 01:43:46.000]   Two people who frighten me most are the online gambling people and the provision people.
[01:43:46.000 --> 01:43:48.000]   I don't know which one is like more.
[01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:49.240]   Tell me you're tempted though.
[01:43:49.240 --> 01:43:51.920]   Aren't you to take that provision?
[01:43:51.920 --> 01:43:53.920]   Aren't you tempted?
[01:43:53.920 --> 01:43:54.920]   It's made out of...
[01:43:54.920 --> 01:43:55.920]   Have you taken it?
[01:43:55.920 --> 01:43:56.920]   No.
[01:43:56.920 --> 01:43:57.920]   Have you taken it?
[01:43:57.920 --> 01:43:58.920]   No.
[01:43:58.920 --> 01:43:59.920]   No.
[01:43:59.920 --> 01:44:00.920]   I do take a lot of sketch supplements.
[01:44:00.920 --> 01:44:04.000]   So why not?
[01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:05.080]   Why not?
[01:44:05.080 --> 01:44:08.840]   One more sketch supplement.
[01:44:08.840 --> 01:44:12.160]   This is just depending on which state you're in and what's legal.
[01:44:12.160 --> 01:44:17.000]   Wateries, again, from state run operators.
[01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:22.040]   Daily fantasy sports, depending on the state, may be regulated as gambling in the US.
[01:44:22.040 --> 01:44:26.840]   But if it's legal in your state, it's going to be on Android.
[01:44:26.840 --> 01:44:35.600]   Applications will be rated adult only and prevent underage users from using.
[01:44:35.600 --> 01:44:39.600]   And the app has to be free to download and not use the Google Play in app billing system.
[01:44:39.600 --> 01:44:45.800]   So Google is lightening up a little bit on gambling on your Android device.
[01:44:45.800 --> 01:44:50.520]   The Android TV home screen gets another revamp this time with some Google TV goodness.
[01:44:50.520 --> 01:44:54.000]   Remember they released a new Chromecast with Google TV.
[01:44:54.000 --> 01:44:56.640]   Not Android TV is very confusing.
[01:44:56.640 --> 01:45:01.000]   Some of the Google TV features are now migrating over to Android TV.
[01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:06.000]   I actually need you to explain this to me because I'm thinking of getting the new Chromecast
[01:45:06.000 --> 01:45:08.680]   with the remote control and the whole thing.
[01:45:08.680 --> 01:45:10.280]   Do I like something every month?
[01:45:10.280 --> 01:45:11.280]   No.
[01:45:11.280 --> 01:45:12.280]   It's just a different Chromecast.
[01:45:12.280 --> 01:45:16.480]   It's just a different UI.
[01:45:16.480 --> 01:45:22.920]   You know, if you want to play any Stadia games, because right now it doesn't work with Stadia,
[01:45:22.920 --> 01:45:25.040]   you need a Chromecast Ultra for that.
[01:45:25.040 --> 01:45:26.280]   I think that's the only...
[01:45:26.280 --> 01:45:27.280]   But it's a nice UI.
[01:45:27.280 --> 01:45:30.600]   I like the Android TV home screen.
[01:45:30.600 --> 01:45:31.840]   And you're going to...
[01:45:31.840 --> 01:45:34.000]   The point of this story is that more and more it's going to...
[01:45:34.000 --> 01:45:35.640]   They're going to look the same.
[01:45:35.640 --> 01:45:36.640]   Okay.
[01:45:36.640 --> 01:45:38.640]   So I should go ahead and find...
[01:45:38.640 --> 01:45:41.080]   I'm vice versa, the Google TV home screen is going to be replacing the Android TV.
[01:45:41.080 --> 01:45:42.880]   Should I buy the new Chromecast with the remote?
[01:45:42.880 --> 01:45:43.880]   Yes.
[01:45:43.880 --> 01:45:44.880]   Yeah, it's very nice.
[01:45:44.880 --> 01:45:45.880]   Yeah.
[01:45:45.880 --> 01:45:46.880]   Okay.
[01:45:46.880 --> 01:45:49.160]   I think for the remote alone it's worth it.
[01:45:49.160 --> 01:45:55.000]   And Android Phone Hub is going to start appearing in Chrome OS.
[01:45:55.000 --> 01:45:56.640]   So look for this.
[01:45:56.640 --> 01:45:58.800]   For a select few.
[01:45:58.800 --> 01:46:04.800]   So I think you're going to be eligible because you use a Pixel phone, right?
[01:46:04.800 --> 01:46:07.720]   Chrome Hub is a code name for a new set of features that make your Android phone and
[01:46:07.720 --> 01:46:09.640]   Chromebook work better together.
[01:46:09.640 --> 01:46:14.600]   You've always been able to unlock your Chromebook with your Android phone.
[01:46:14.600 --> 01:46:17.120]   But they'll also be instant tethering.
[01:46:17.120 --> 01:46:20.360]   Google Messages Integration, which is great.
[01:46:20.360 --> 01:46:24.320]   Android Notifications will show up on your Chrome OS desktop.
[01:46:24.320 --> 01:46:27.160]   They'll recent Chrome tabs will be shared.
[01:46:27.160 --> 01:46:30.440]   Handy options like silencing your phone and locating would also be available from the
[01:46:30.440 --> 01:46:31.440]   Chrome OS.
[01:46:31.440 --> 01:46:37.800]   Desktop, this will all be powered by Google Play Services.
[01:46:37.800 --> 01:46:42.400]   It's right now in the dev or Canary channels and your phone has to have a beta version of
[01:46:42.400 --> 01:46:43.600]   Google Play Services.
[01:46:43.600 --> 01:46:45.360]   So I would just wait.
[01:46:45.360 --> 01:46:50.440]   And I'm not clear what if you'll have to have a Pixel to do this.
[01:46:50.440 --> 01:46:53.120]   I'm not sure which phones will support it.
[01:46:53.120 --> 01:46:57.040]   So probably more than just the Pixel.
[01:46:57.040 --> 01:47:00.560]   I don't see any restriction to Pixel.
[01:47:00.560 --> 01:47:08.760]   And that, my friends, thank you to Jason Howell as the Google Change Dog.
[01:47:08.760 --> 01:47:12.120]   The Change Dog.
[01:47:12.120 --> 01:47:13.680]   Uber's buying Drizzly.
[01:47:13.680 --> 01:47:16.200]   Do you care?
[01:47:16.200 --> 01:47:18.360]   Getting the alcohol now, right?
[01:47:18.360 --> 01:47:20.240]   It's a booze delivery company, yeah.
[01:47:20.240 --> 01:47:22.320]   Drizzly never did any delivery.
[01:47:22.320 --> 01:47:23.320]   I didn't realize this.
[01:47:23.320 --> 01:47:27.000]   They provided the backends for your local liquor store to do their delivery.
[01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:28.000]   So it's just a...
[01:47:28.000 --> 01:47:29.560]   At a very high price, right?
[01:47:29.560 --> 01:47:30.560]   Yeah.
[01:47:30.560 --> 01:47:33.360]   And actually, I did it only once in my life.
[01:47:33.360 --> 01:47:40.840]   And to Bevmo, and it didn't work, I had to call Bevmo and say, "Where's my delivery
[01:47:40.840 --> 01:47:41.840]   three days later?"
[01:47:41.840 --> 01:47:42.840]   I paid for it.
[01:47:42.840 --> 01:47:43.840]   They said, "Oh, yeah, it's right here."
[01:47:43.840 --> 01:47:44.840]   "So what'd you bring it up?"
[01:47:44.840 --> 01:47:45.840]   "So what'd you bring it up?"
[01:47:45.840 --> 01:47:46.840]   "So what'd you bring it up?"
[01:47:46.840 --> 01:47:49.240]   And they said, "Next time, just use us.
[01:47:49.240 --> 01:47:50.240]   Don't use Drizzly.
[01:47:50.240 --> 01:47:51.240]   So I don't know how we...
[01:47:51.240 --> 01:47:52.240]   Drizzly."
[01:47:52.240 --> 01:47:53.240]   Was that where you were going to make that weird cocktail?
[01:47:53.240 --> 01:47:54.240]   Yes.
[01:47:54.240 --> 01:47:55.240]   And you got the ingredient?
[01:47:55.240 --> 01:47:56.240]   It was.
[01:47:56.240 --> 01:47:57.240]   How did you know that?
[01:47:57.240 --> 01:47:58.240]   I remember that.
[01:47:58.240 --> 01:48:03.520]   Did we talk about Andries and Horowitz doing their own journalistic thing?
[01:48:03.520 --> 01:48:04.520]   I don't think we did.
[01:48:04.520 --> 01:48:05.520]   I don't think we did, sir.
[01:48:05.520 --> 01:48:06.520]   No, no.
[01:48:06.520 --> 01:48:08.760]   It's time to stop this call.
[01:48:08.760 --> 01:48:11.120]   You don't want to talk about this?
[01:48:11.120 --> 01:48:12.120]   I don't want to talk about this.
[01:48:12.120 --> 01:48:14.480]   All right, let me do an ad and then Stacy can go home.
[01:48:14.480 --> 01:48:15.480]   Our show today...
[01:48:15.480 --> 01:48:17.400]   We can do anything else.
[01:48:17.400 --> 01:48:18.400]   Just not that story.
[01:48:18.400 --> 01:48:19.400]   Just curiosity.
[01:48:19.400 --> 01:48:23.000]   Why do you hate that one?
[01:48:23.000 --> 01:48:26.200]   Because then we have to talk about the...
[01:48:26.200 --> 01:48:27.200]   Clubhouse?
[01:48:27.200 --> 01:48:32.280]   People at Andries and Horowitz and their high opinions of themselves.
[01:48:32.280 --> 01:48:34.400]   Is it banner mark you don't like?
[01:48:34.400 --> 01:48:37.800]   I don't even want to talk about it.
[01:48:37.800 --> 01:48:39.440]   I love this.
[01:48:39.440 --> 01:48:41.160]   We have tapped a nerve.
[01:48:41.160 --> 01:48:42.160]   I don't know.
[01:48:42.160 --> 01:48:43.160]   I'm not a fan either, but I just...
[01:48:43.160 --> 01:48:47.040]   I have never said a bad thing about Mark Andries and in my life and he blocked me.
[01:48:47.040 --> 01:48:48.520]   I cannot understand why.
[01:48:48.520 --> 01:48:51.280]   It's because you know me and Stacy.
[01:48:51.280 --> 01:48:54.160]   He says, "If your friends with Stacy, Higginbotham and Leo Laporte, I don't..."
[01:48:54.160 --> 01:48:59.840]   People with mediocre thoughts and thin skin just can't handle.
[01:48:59.840 --> 01:49:02.400]   Well, and look at the shape of his head.
[01:49:02.400 --> 01:49:03.480]   I mean, there's something...
[01:49:03.480 --> 01:49:06.320]   I'm not going to talk about somebody badly because of all that.
[01:49:06.320 --> 01:49:07.920]   I know, that's mean.
[01:49:07.920 --> 01:49:09.080]   That's not a sweat.
[01:49:09.080 --> 01:49:10.080]   Yeah.
[01:49:10.080 --> 01:49:11.880]   All right, thank you, Stacy.
[01:49:11.880 --> 01:49:12.880]   I enjoyed that.
[01:49:12.880 --> 01:49:13.880]   I'm not off with this.
[01:49:13.880 --> 01:49:16.320]   I'm a little soup saw of Stacy.
[01:49:16.320 --> 01:49:17.320]   You've been around a nerve.
[01:49:17.320 --> 01:49:18.320]   It is kind of interesting though.
[01:49:18.320 --> 01:49:20.960]   I'll tell you where there's an interesting angle.
[01:49:20.960 --> 01:49:27.520]   So Clubhouse, which is also an A16Z investment.
[01:49:27.520 --> 01:49:28.760]   And it's very hot right now, right?
[01:49:28.760 --> 01:49:29.760]   It's like a billion.
[01:49:29.760 --> 01:49:30.760]   It's a unicorn, another unicorn.
[01:49:30.760 --> 01:49:32.520]   God, everybody's on Clubhouse.
[01:49:32.520 --> 01:49:34.080]   My husband's like, "I'm on Clubhouse."
[01:49:34.080 --> 01:49:35.080]   I know.
[01:49:35.080 --> 01:49:36.080]   I couldn't be on Clubhouse.
[01:49:36.080 --> 01:49:38.480]   I'll send you an invite if you want to be on it.
[01:49:38.480 --> 01:49:39.480]   No, I haven't.
[01:49:39.480 --> 01:49:40.480]   I just haven't...
[01:49:40.480 --> 01:49:41.480]   Let me just see who...
[01:49:41.480 --> 01:49:42.480]   Let me just see what I'm missing.
[01:49:42.480 --> 01:49:43.480]   I'm sold out on Android.
[01:49:43.480 --> 01:49:44.880]   No, I'm selling it, right?
[01:49:44.880 --> 01:49:49.400]   So Jason Freed's doing a startup and product chat with Ryan Hoover and Kevin Rose.
[01:49:49.400 --> 01:49:50.760]   Love those guys.
[01:49:50.760 --> 01:49:53.360]   I'm an elevated wit club that's Barrett to Andes.
[01:49:53.360 --> 01:49:54.360]   Barrett's Sunday.
[01:49:54.360 --> 01:49:55.360]   Yep.
[01:49:55.360 --> 01:49:57.000]   Transitioning to tech and what we've learned.
[01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:58.000]   I don't know who...
[01:49:58.000 --> 01:49:59.000]   Wesley Faulkner.
[01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:00.000]   Oh, you want to watch these?
[01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:01.000]   Oh, Wesley's.
[01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:02.000]   Yeah.
[01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:03.000]   Because these are people I follow.
[01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:04.000]   That's why.
[01:50:04.000 --> 01:50:05.000]   Oh, my license.
[01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:07.120]   I got to turn that around.
[01:50:07.120 --> 01:50:10.720]   And Marshall Arts and Fashion.
[01:50:10.720 --> 01:50:12.840]   That sounds fun.
[01:50:12.840 --> 01:50:14.000]   So these are rooms you go into.
[01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:17.840]   I can't play it because that's part of the deal is you can't stream it or anything.
[01:50:17.840 --> 01:50:19.400]   You can only have to be there.
[01:50:19.400 --> 01:50:22.480]   But last week, 10 p.m.
[01:50:22.480 --> 01:50:25.200]   Elon Musk does a little clubhouse.
[01:50:25.200 --> 01:50:27.560]   5,000 people try to hear it.
[01:50:27.560 --> 01:50:28.560]   More people show up.
[01:50:28.560 --> 01:50:33.200]   They have to do an overflow room than another overflow room because Elon Musk is Elon Musk.
[01:50:33.200 --> 01:50:37.080]   And then he brings up the CEO of Robinhood.
[01:50:37.080 --> 01:50:41.760]   But I should point out all of these are Andes and Horowitz's investments.
[01:50:41.760 --> 01:50:46.120]   Every one of them.
[01:50:46.120 --> 01:50:48.640]   So it's kind of...
[01:50:48.640 --> 01:50:49.720]   I think what it's...
[01:50:49.720 --> 01:50:54.520]   I mean, that doesn't bother me because I shouldn't bother you Stacey or anybody who's
[01:50:54.520 --> 01:50:56.320]   in journalism because...
[01:50:56.320 --> 01:51:03.840]   Well, did bother Jessica lessen at the information because she's worried that with companies doing
[01:51:03.840 --> 01:51:10.280]   their own journalistic enterprise and frankly, I mean, I wouldn't expect anything coming from
[01:51:10.280 --> 01:51:14.680]   Andes and Horowitz not to promote Andes and Horowitz stuff.
[01:51:14.680 --> 01:51:15.680]   Or is...
[01:51:15.680 --> 01:51:17.840]   Andes is worried that it's going to take over from journalism.
[01:51:17.840 --> 01:51:20.400]   But I think people are going to know the difference and they're going to say, "No, I want to hear
[01:51:20.400 --> 01:51:21.400]   what Stacey thinks."
[01:51:21.400 --> 01:51:22.400]   Yeah, it's just another...
[01:51:22.400 --> 01:51:23.400]   I think there is a...
[01:51:23.400 --> 01:51:25.840]   Oh, we're talking about it.
[01:51:25.840 --> 01:51:28.800]   I think there has been a very...
[01:51:28.800 --> 01:51:30.840]   Realer end.
[01:51:30.840 --> 01:51:33.520]   All right.
[01:51:33.520 --> 01:51:39.840]   There has been a confusion and it's been happening for the last probably 15 years and
[01:51:39.840 --> 01:51:44.920]   a lack of questions because some journalists are not great at their jobs or they're great
[01:51:44.920 --> 01:51:47.600]   at some parts of their jobs but they don't want to lose access.
[01:51:47.600 --> 01:51:54.880]   There's true journalism isn't sitting there and taking press releases and talking.
[01:51:54.880 --> 01:51:56.240]   You actually have to know something about it.
[01:51:56.240 --> 01:51:57.400]   You have to ask the hard questions.
[01:51:57.400 --> 01:52:00.440]   You have to go and find stories that maybe people don't want you to tell.
[01:52:00.440 --> 01:52:03.800]   And you can't have investments in the companies you're covering.
[01:52:03.800 --> 01:52:04.800]   Right.
[01:52:04.800 --> 01:52:05.800]   Oh, there's not.
[01:52:05.800 --> 01:52:06.800]   And there's...
[01:52:06.800 --> 01:52:10.040]   But there's a huge audience.
[01:52:10.040 --> 01:52:15.200]   It's non... for critical, like quote-unquote, critical thinkers in the tech industry, they're
[01:52:15.200 --> 01:52:20.560]   horribly uncritical about the content they consume and it's just...
[01:52:20.560 --> 01:52:22.600]   It drives me up a wall.
[01:52:22.600 --> 01:52:25.280]   So this whole strategy is just...
[01:52:25.280 --> 01:52:27.640]   It's this insular bubble just getting...
[01:52:27.640 --> 01:52:30.440]   That's exactly what Casey Newton says.
[01:52:30.440 --> 01:52:31.960]   He says, "I'm Larry of any company..."
[01:52:31.960 --> 01:52:33.720]   You're going to play Leole.
[01:52:33.720 --> 01:52:34.720]   Hold on.
[01:52:34.720 --> 01:52:38.400]   Casey Newton says, "I'm Larry of any company that thinks regularly talking to journalists
[01:52:38.400 --> 01:52:43.160]   is beneath them."
[01:52:43.160 --> 01:52:48.800]   And let's see, Benedict Evans has described Andrew Eason-Hoorowitz as a media company
[01:52:48.800 --> 01:52:50.440]   that monetizes through VC.
[01:52:50.440 --> 01:52:52.880]   Well, that's interesting.
[01:52:52.880 --> 01:52:54.400]   I would have thought the other way around.
[01:52:54.400 --> 01:52:55.400]   That's interesting.
[01:52:55.400 --> 01:52:57.200]   Okay, go ahead, Jeff.
[01:52:57.200 --> 01:52:59.200]   So my...
[01:52:59.200 --> 01:53:05.960]   I think that once most media and present companies excluded most of the time, Leole,
[01:53:05.960 --> 01:53:10.040]   Casey all the time, most of the time, has gone...
[01:53:10.040 --> 01:53:14.320]   Moral Panicky has gone negative, has gone dystopian.
[01:53:14.320 --> 01:53:19.360]   I think that there is a different perspective that they just don't get out and they can
[01:53:19.360 --> 01:53:20.360]   do it on their own.
[01:53:20.360 --> 01:53:25.520]   So I think the real import of this is I'd sell your stock in a PR company.
[01:53:25.520 --> 01:53:28.440]   Oh, because that's who they're really bypassing.
[01:53:28.440 --> 01:53:30.360]   That's who they're really bypassing.
[01:53:30.360 --> 01:53:31.360]   That's who they're really bypassing.
[01:53:31.360 --> 01:53:34.280]   It's not news, but PR.
[01:53:34.280 --> 01:53:37.600]   They used to be the intermediary between companies and journalists.
[01:53:37.600 --> 01:53:45.680]   Now, the other piece of this is I'm not completely pessimistic about the quality of this, mainly
[01:53:45.680 --> 01:53:47.680]   because I look at...
[01:53:47.680 --> 01:53:51.400]   You know, I'm a great fan of Ben Evans and Ben was a employee of Vittrese and Horawitz
[01:53:51.400 --> 01:53:53.400]   as an analyst for a long time.
[01:53:53.400 --> 01:53:57.440]   And his analysis was always sharp and independent.
[01:53:57.440 --> 01:54:01.440]   And he now he's truly independent and I value him greatly.
[01:54:01.440 --> 01:54:06.520]   By the way, his annual PowerPoint extravaganza is on the rundown this week and it's great
[01:54:06.520 --> 01:54:07.960]   and it's smart.
[01:54:07.960 --> 01:54:13.120]   And so they did foster Ben before.
[01:54:13.120 --> 01:54:14.120]   Yeah.
[01:54:14.120 --> 01:54:15.120]   And at Evans.
[01:54:15.120 --> 01:54:16.120]   Well, you know what?
[01:54:16.120 --> 01:54:21.400]   Any VC firm hires the smartest people it can because they're trying to make the best investments.
[01:54:21.400 --> 01:54:25.240]   So there are plenty of great smart people working in these companies.
[01:54:25.240 --> 01:54:26.240]   That's not a...
[01:54:26.240 --> 01:54:27.240]   I mean...
[01:54:27.240 --> 01:54:29.240]   They may be obnoxious sometimes, but...
[01:54:29.240 --> 01:54:33.160]   They're a little bro culture in some, but for the most...
[01:54:33.160 --> 01:54:40.840]   I just think that I don't want to see the traditional media replaced by, you know, pet
[01:54:40.840 --> 01:54:45.040]   media because that's not going to benefit end users.
[01:54:45.040 --> 01:54:47.920]   But I don't think it will be.
[01:54:47.920 --> 01:54:48.920]   People are, I think, smarter than that.
[01:54:48.920 --> 01:54:50.440]   It's going to be another source.
[01:54:50.440 --> 01:54:52.720]   Look, Clubhouse has a lot of startup news.
[01:54:52.720 --> 01:54:55.240]   That's, you know, it's like...
[01:54:55.240 --> 01:54:56.240]   And it will be...
[01:54:56.240 --> 01:54:58.240]   As soon as it becomes...
[01:54:58.240 --> 01:55:00.640]   It's everything I don't like.
[01:55:00.640 --> 01:55:01.640]   I was just going to...
[01:55:01.640 --> 01:55:03.920]   It's everything I disliked about San Francisco, right?
[01:55:03.920 --> 01:55:05.760]   Yes, it's very much that.
[01:55:05.760 --> 01:55:06.760]   Yep.
[01:55:06.760 --> 01:55:07.760]   Probably.
[01:55:07.760 --> 01:55:08.760]   It's...
[01:55:08.760 --> 01:55:09.760]   You can't find anybody who...
[01:55:09.760 --> 01:55:12.000]   I mean, you can, but you really have to dig for it.
[01:55:12.000 --> 01:55:14.880]   Everybody there is focused on their tech.
[01:55:14.880 --> 01:55:16.080]   It's focused on their startup.
[01:55:16.080 --> 01:55:17.240]   It's what can you do for me.
[01:55:17.240 --> 01:55:18.240]   It's very focused on...
[01:55:18.240 --> 01:55:19.240]   I don't like it either.
[01:55:19.240 --> 01:55:20.240]   I'm with you.
[01:55:20.240 --> 01:55:21.240]   So...
[01:55:21.240 --> 01:55:25.960]   But that being said, you know, Kevin and I are going to do something.
[01:55:25.960 --> 01:55:27.960]   We're going to talk about IoT.
[01:55:27.960 --> 01:55:29.960]   Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[01:55:29.960 --> 01:55:30.960]   Drag.
[01:55:30.960 --> 01:55:31.960]   So...
[01:55:31.960 --> 01:55:32.960]   So...
[01:55:32.960 --> 01:55:33.960]   So...
[01:55:33.960 --> 01:55:34.960]   So...
[01:55:34.960 --> 01:55:35.960]   So...
[01:55:35.960 --> 01:55:36.960]   So...
[01:55:36.960 --> 01:55:37.960]   So...
[01:55:37.960 --> 01:55:38.960]   So...
[01:55:38.960 --> 01:55:39.960]   Yeah.
[01:55:39.960 --> 01:55:40.960]   Oh, tell me when.
[01:55:40.960 --> 01:55:41.960]   We have to...
[01:55:41.960 --> 01:55:42.960]   I mean, you have to...
[01:55:42.960 --> 01:55:43.960]   No, you don't have to.
[01:55:43.960 --> 01:55:45.960]   My impression is it was just another extension of...
[01:55:45.960 --> 01:55:46.960]   I hate saying it like this.
[01:55:46.960 --> 01:55:48.960]   It was like an extension of YouTube for...
[01:55:48.960 --> 01:55:50.960]   It's more like, you know, different influence.
[01:55:50.960 --> 01:55:51.960]   Yeah, for audio.
[01:55:51.960 --> 01:55:52.960]   You just don't have to do your makeup.
[01:55:52.960 --> 01:55:53.960]   Yeah.
[01:55:53.960 --> 01:55:54.960]   It's...
[01:55:54.960 --> 01:55:55.960]   It's very fizzy when they start.
[01:55:55.960 --> 01:55:57.960]   Right now it's invite only.
[01:55:57.960 --> 01:56:01.960]   As soon as it becomes open to the public, it's immediately going to be the worst place in
[01:56:01.960 --> 01:56:02.960]   the world.
[01:56:02.960 --> 01:56:05.960]   And it'll be shut down in a year.
[01:56:05.960 --> 01:56:07.960]   Honestly, there's no hope for this.
[01:56:07.960 --> 01:56:09.960]   There's no hope for any social network like this.
[01:56:09.960 --> 01:56:11.960]   Because people are horrible.
[01:56:11.960 --> 01:56:12.960]   And...
[01:56:12.960 --> 01:56:13.960]   I'm not horrible.
[01:56:13.960 --> 01:56:15.960]   No, you're wonderful.
[01:56:15.960 --> 01:56:18.960]   But, you know, it's the end...
[01:56:18.960 --> 01:56:19.960]   I like people.
[01:56:19.960 --> 01:56:20.960]   It's humanity I don't like.
[01:56:20.960 --> 01:56:21.960]   It's somewhat...
[01:56:21.960 --> 01:56:23.960]   TikTok is doing somewhat the same thing, though, right?
[01:56:23.960 --> 01:56:24.960]   I mean, no this is not.
[01:56:24.960 --> 01:56:25.960]   Yeah, but this is different.
[01:56:25.960 --> 01:56:26.960]   This is long to one conversation.
[01:56:26.960 --> 01:56:30.960]   When you go in these, it's a conversation that's very different, right?
[01:56:30.960 --> 01:56:31.960]   And it's long form.
[01:56:31.960 --> 01:56:32.960]   You go...
[01:56:32.960 --> 01:56:33.960]   These go on for hours.
[01:56:33.960 --> 01:56:35.960]   You know, Stacey and Kevin are going to sit there for hours.
[01:56:35.960 --> 01:56:37.960]   Like, no, we don't.
[01:56:37.960 --> 01:56:38.960]   Because it's Stacey.
[01:56:38.960 --> 01:56:40.960]   Stacey, I was like...
[01:56:40.960 --> 01:56:41.960]   I was going to say, "When's dinner?
[01:56:41.960 --> 01:56:42.960]   I gotta go."
[01:56:42.960 --> 01:56:46.960]   I'd be like, "We will be here for the next 30 minutes.
[01:56:46.960 --> 01:56:47.960]   Let's talk."
[01:56:47.960 --> 01:56:49.960]   I've sat in a few things.
[01:56:49.960 --> 01:56:52.960]   It's, you know, it's sitting around the pork barrel, the pickle barrel, and...
[01:56:52.960 --> 01:56:54.960]   The pickle barrel and BS.
[01:56:54.960 --> 01:56:55.960]   And, you know...
[01:56:55.960 --> 01:56:56.960]   Yeah, pickle barrel.
[01:56:56.960 --> 01:56:57.960]   [laughter]
[01:56:57.960 --> 01:57:00.960]   I'm going to start a new one called pickle barrel.
[01:57:00.960 --> 01:57:03.960]   You can come and be in my pickle barrel.
[01:57:03.960 --> 01:57:04.960]   It'll be Diltock.
[01:57:04.960 --> 01:57:07.960]   All right, get your pick ready because we're almost wrapping this thing up.
[01:57:07.960 --> 01:57:11.960]   I just have one more commercial to do for our sponsor, Cashfly.
[01:57:11.960 --> 01:57:12.960]   They're more than a sponsor.
[01:57:12.960 --> 01:57:13.960]   They're a partner.
[01:57:13.960 --> 01:57:16.960]   In fact, they have been for over 10 years.
[01:57:16.960 --> 01:57:17.960]   When you...
[01:57:17.960 --> 01:57:21.960]   When I say, you know, bandwidth for Twitter is provided by Cashfly
[01:57:21.960 --> 01:57:24.960]   at CACHEFLY.com.
[01:57:24.960 --> 01:57:25.960]   It's because it is.
[01:57:25.960 --> 01:57:26.960]   They are...
[01:57:26.960 --> 01:57:28.960]   That's where you're getting our stuff from.
[01:57:28.960 --> 01:57:29.960]   Video, audio.
[01:57:29.960 --> 01:57:33.960]   Cashfly has been innovating content delivery since 1999.
[01:57:33.960 --> 01:57:36.960]   They saved our bacon in the early days of Twit.
[01:57:36.960 --> 01:57:38.960]   We were trying to figure out, "How do we stream?
[01:57:38.960 --> 01:57:39.960]   How do we do this?
[01:57:39.960 --> 01:57:41.960]   Can't come off a website."
[01:57:41.960 --> 01:57:43.960]   That was a measure of success, I guess.
[01:57:43.960 --> 01:57:48.960]   But, thankfully, Matt Levine, who's the founder, came to me and said, "Please, let me help."
[01:57:48.960 --> 01:57:50.960]   And, well, the rest is history.
[01:57:50.960 --> 01:57:56.960]   We've been using CDN, Cashfly CDN, content delivery network ever since.
[01:57:56.960 --> 01:58:00.960]   And, this is how I can say with absolute confidence, they're the best.
[01:58:00.960 --> 01:58:03.960]   Never have had any problem when you download our podcast.
[01:58:03.960 --> 01:58:07.960]   They come in fast because you're getting them from a server near you.
[01:58:07.960 --> 01:58:09.960]   And, that's one of the keys.
[01:58:09.960 --> 01:58:12.960]   Their new thing is ultra low latency streaming.
[01:58:12.960 --> 01:58:17.960]   If you're doing live, WebRTC is okay, but this is not that.
[01:58:17.960 --> 01:58:19.960]   This is streamed to Lays of less than a second.
[01:58:19.960 --> 01:58:21.960]   Less than a second latency.
[01:58:21.960 --> 01:58:29.960]   They have an HTML5 player that offers easy support anywhere with an SDK available even for mobile, which is fantastic.
[01:58:29.960 --> 01:58:35.960]   And, whether you need your player to run on websites, applications, mobile devices, or whatever platform they've got you covered.
[01:58:35.960 --> 01:58:37.960]   Again, can I say it again?
[01:58:37.960 --> 01:58:39.960]   Less than one second of latency.
[01:58:39.960 --> 01:58:40.960]   Anywhere in the world.
[01:58:40.960 --> 01:58:42.960]   That's the thing about Cashfly.
[01:58:42.960 --> 01:58:47.960]   They have over 50 points of presence, Pops, servers all over the world.
[01:58:47.960 --> 01:58:49.960]   That's the whole idea.
[01:58:49.960 --> 01:58:52.960]   You're going to get your content from someone near you.
[01:58:52.960 --> 01:58:56.960]   And, it gets into those Pops using their own low latency background.
[01:58:56.960 --> 01:59:03.960]   So, your backbone, so your video streams will be streaming quickly, no matter what continent your viewers are on or all of them.
[01:59:03.960 --> 01:59:05.960]   Infantly scalable.
[01:59:05.960 --> 01:59:12.960]   Cashfly's ultra low latency video platform can deliver video to more than a million users concurrently.
[01:59:12.960 --> 01:59:17.960]   It can ingest thousands of synchronous streams reliably too.
[01:59:17.960 --> 01:59:19.960]   And, they support everything.
[01:59:19.960 --> 01:59:24.960]   It's designed to transmux thousands of streams simultaneously with live failover.
[01:59:24.960 --> 01:59:28.960]   RTMP, RTMPS, SRT, and more.
[01:59:28.960 --> 01:59:36.960]   They're going to give your end users ultra low latency SLDP or HLS streams simultaneously, whichever one they prefer.
[01:59:36.960 --> 01:59:47.960]   Get a solution that works for you tailored to your unique needs and it's all built on top of Cashfly's amazing, amazing, robust global network.
[01:59:47.960 --> 01:59:50.960]   With ingest and delivery, no matter where you need it anywhere in the world.
[01:59:50.960 --> 01:59:54.960]   Best of all, 24/7, 365 priority support.
[01:59:54.960 --> 01:59:56.960]   There's always somebody to talk to.
[01:59:56.960 --> 01:59:58.960]   They have the best engineers there.
[01:59:58.960 --> 02:00:00.960]   And, I love what they've built here.
[02:00:00.960 --> 02:00:02.960]   1 million concurrent streams.
[02:00:02.960 --> 02:00:03.960]   Amazing.
[02:00:03.960 --> 02:00:04.960]   More than.
[02:00:04.960 --> 02:00:07.960]   And up to five times faster than other CDNs.
[02:00:07.960 --> 02:00:13.960]   It's the world's most reliable CDN backed by a 100% SLA.
[02:00:13.960 --> 02:00:14.960]   100%.
[02:00:14.960 --> 02:00:16.960]   This is good as you can get.
[02:00:16.960 --> 02:00:22.960]   Cashfly is helping out people during COVID-19 by supporting World Central Kitchen.
[02:00:22.960 --> 02:00:24.960]   They've already donated over $50,000.
[02:00:24.960 --> 02:00:25.960]   There's more to come.
[02:00:25.960 --> 02:00:31.960]   They're serving warm meals to people struggling during this very tough time.
[02:00:31.960 --> 02:00:33.960]   Cashfly, I don't know if you know this.
[02:00:33.960 --> 02:00:38.960]   They pioneered any cash, the any cash CDN infrastructure way back in 2002.
[02:00:38.960 --> 02:00:44.960]   And their best top technology automatically finds the fastest route to and from customer
[02:00:44.960 --> 02:00:49.560]   origin across that global network of pop says talking about that way you get maximum performance
[02:00:49.560 --> 02:00:51.160]   and reliability.
[02:00:51.160 --> 02:00:54.160]   We could not be happier with Cashfly.
[02:00:54.160 --> 02:00:55.960]   Find out what Cashfly could do for you.
[02:00:55.960 --> 02:00:56.960]   No pressure.
[02:00:56.960 --> 02:00:59.960]   No, you know, just informative.
[02:00:59.960 --> 02:01:04.760]   They'll give you a complimentary detailed analysis of your current CDN bill and usage trends.
[02:01:04.760 --> 02:01:10.160]   If you are thinking maybe you need something better, maybe you don't have a CDN, maybe
[02:01:10.160 --> 02:01:15.240]   you want ultra low latency streaming, maybe you're overpaying and you want to save,
[02:01:15.240 --> 02:01:17.120]   twit.cashfly.com.
[02:01:17.120 --> 02:01:21.640]   Bring them your current bill and your usage trends and see what they can do for you.
[02:01:21.640 --> 02:01:23.120]   No pressure.
[02:01:23.120 --> 02:01:24.120]   Just information.
[02:01:24.120 --> 02:01:25.120]   twit.cashfly.com.
[02:01:25.120 --> 02:01:27.880]   They've been a great partner.
[02:01:27.880 --> 02:01:32.040]   We are so grateful to Cashfly.
[02:01:32.040 --> 02:01:33.600]   The chatroom reviews are coming in.
[02:01:33.600 --> 02:01:39.480]   I love this show, but it's the smugest show on twit.
[02:01:39.480 --> 02:01:41.880]   And they say, yeah, that's part of its charm.
[02:01:41.880 --> 02:01:43.880]   So the smugness continues.
[02:01:43.880 --> 02:01:44.880]   What the hell?
[02:01:44.880 --> 02:01:45.880]   What the hell?
[02:01:45.880 --> 02:01:46.880]   You see.
[02:01:46.880 --> 02:01:49.280]   I don't want to be smug.
[02:01:49.280 --> 02:01:50.280]   We're not smug.
[02:01:50.280 --> 02:01:52.440]   We're just better than everybody else.
[02:01:52.440 --> 02:01:53.440]   That's all.
[02:01:53.440 --> 02:01:54.440]   Sorry.
[02:01:54.440 --> 02:01:55.440]   Stacey.
[02:01:55.440 --> 02:01:56.440]   I don't think I'm better than anything else.
[02:01:56.440 --> 02:01:57.440]   I know.
[02:01:57.440 --> 02:01:59.520]   I put words in your mouth.
[02:01:59.520 --> 02:02:02.760]   Stacey Higginbotham, would you like to give us a peek?
[02:02:02.760 --> 02:02:09.080]   So I am going to be a little promotional today, but only because I want to help you all out.
[02:02:09.080 --> 02:02:11.120]   Not because, I mean, yes, it does help me out.
[02:02:11.120 --> 02:02:12.120]   It's for us.
[02:02:12.120 --> 02:02:13.120]   It's for us.
[02:02:13.120 --> 02:02:14.120]   We're doing it.
[02:02:14.120 --> 02:02:15.360]   You're doing it for us.
[02:02:15.360 --> 02:02:16.880]   Wink has been down for O.M.
[02:02:16.880 --> 02:02:18.560]   Oh, I was going to ask you about this.
[02:02:18.560 --> 02:02:20.040]   Somebody call me on Sunday.
[02:02:20.040 --> 02:02:21.880]   I'm so glad you brought this up.
[02:02:21.880 --> 02:02:24.800]   Are they still down?
[02:02:24.800 --> 02:02:25.800]   They were this morning last night.
[02:02:25.800 --> 02:02:26.800]   Who's going on?
[02:02:26.800 --> 02:02:27.800]   I published a story.
[02:02:27.800 --> 02:02:29.040]   Yes, they're still down.
[02:02:29.040 --> 02:02:30.040]   You're in Strudglin.
[02:02:30.040 --> 02:02:34.640]   This is going on since the 25th.
[02:02:34.640 --> 02:02:36.200]   No, it's, yeah.
[02:02:36.200 --> 02:02:37.840]   Yes, that's true.
[02:02:37.840 --> 02:02:39.720]   And they did give people a discount.
[02:02:39.720 --> 02:02:42.320]   So I have a wink subscription or I had one.
[02:02:42.320 --> 02:02:43.320]   Well, we should.
[02:02:43.320 --> 02:02:44.320]   Yeah.
[02:02:44.320 --> 02:02:48.960]   The story so far, people bought the Wink device free service.
[02:02:48.960 --> 02:02:51.560]   Then they realized that's not a financial model.
[02:02:51.560 --> 02:02:56.000]   Earlier last year, they started charging people five bucks a month.
[02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:59.200]   That's a financial model, but everybody was pissed off.
[02:02:59.200 --> 02:03:01.360]   Now they've been down for more than 10 days.
[02:03:01.360 --> 02:03:02.920]   And I'm wondering if it's related.
[02:03:02.920 --> 02:03:05.800]   Like, what's going on?
[02:03:05.800 --> 02:03:08.680]   Yeah, who knows?
[02:03:08.680 --> 02:03:11.000]   So yes, so we don't know.
[02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:15.920]   And believe me, I have spent probably like a whole week of my life trying to get in touch
[02:03:15.920 --> 02:03:16.920]   with Wink.
[02:03:16.920 --> 02:03:17.920]   Yeah.
[02:03:17.920 --> 02:03:20.680]   If I look back on my efforts.
[02:03:20.680 --> 02:03:23.600]   This is a journalist like, Hey, what's up?
[02:03:23.600 --> 02:03:25.960]   So I did a story.
[02:03:25.960 --> 02:03:30.920]   The idea was the reason you stick with Wink for the most part, for most people is because
[02:03:30.920 --> 02:03:36.200]   you still have Z-Wave and Ziggy devices that you like and you don't, they don't work with.
[02:03:36.200 --> 02:03:37.200]   Well, okay.
[02:03:37.200 --> 02:03:44.600]   Ziggy devices can work with Madam A or the Echo, some of the Echoes, but not all of them do.
[02:03:44.600 --> 02:03:49.360]   And so for those people out there who are like, I got all this Z-Wave gear.
[02:03:49.360 --> 02:03:50.360]   What am I supposed to do?
[02:03:50.360 --> 02:03:53.280]   I try to create a rundown of options.
[02:03:53.280 --> 02:03:56.720]   What I discovered though, is most of those options are sold out.
[02:03:56.720 --> 02:03:57.720]   Oh.
[02:03:57.720 --> 02:04:01.040]   So it's kind of, it's kind of sucky.
[02:04:01.040 --> 02:04:05.120]   But in order, in like, in what I did as I wrote a post, and this is in order of like
[02:04:05.120 --> 02:04:10.640]   ease of use, how in, in y'all are, the audience here is pretty tech savvy.
[02:04:10.640 --> 02:04:14.160]   So without smart things, you're probably like, that's cool.
[02:04:14.160 --> 02:04:19.080]   I could probably load some software onto a pie and get a Z-Wave dongle and use something
[02:04:19.080 --> 02:04:20.720]   like Home Assistant.
[02:04:20.720 --> 02:04:23.120]   But you know, your options are smart things.
[02:04:23.120 --> 02:04:24.680]   They're no longer making their hardware.
[02:04:24.680 --> 02:04:25.680]   Oh no.
[02:04:25.680 --> 02:04:27.680]   But they were bought by Samsung.
[02:04:27.680 --> 02:04:28.680]   They announced this.
[02:04:28.680 --> 02:04:29.680]   They're going out of business terms.
[02:04:29.680 --> 02:04:31.200]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[02:04:31.200 --> 02:04:32.760]   they're just going to focus on the software.
[02:04:32.760 --> 02:04:37.160]   So they've pushed, so it's actually been very difficult to find a smart things hub.
[02:04:37.160 --> 02:04:42.840]   AOTEC is going to be making them, but they're not available yet here in the US, which is
[02:04:42.840 --> 02:04:43.840]   frustrating.
[02:04:43.840 --> 02:04:46.240]   So they'll be available in a couple of weeks, according to smart things.
[02:04:46.240 --> 02:04:50.920]   The other one that'll be available later this month is EZLO, is a brand you may not have
[02:04:50.920 --> 02:04:55.480]   heard of, but it's a VeraLite Central Light, sorry, Vera Central Light and Fortress came
[02:04:55.480 --> 02:04:56.760]   together.
[02:04:56.760 --> 02:05:01.240]   And then the other option that's still sort of easy for people, like normal people to
[02:05:01.240 --> 02:05:04.240]   use is something called Hubitat Elevation, but that's also sold out.
[02:05:04.240 --> 02:05:06.720]   So all your easy options are kind of not on the market.
[02:05:06.720 --> 02:05:10.960]   I told the guy who called, I said, this is the problem with going through a third-party
[02:05:10.960 --> 02:05:12.160]   server.
[02:05:12.160 --> 02:05:15.480]   You would be better off running your own server.
[02:05:15.480 --> 02:05:17.600]   And so I mentioned Hoobs.
[02:05:17.600 --> 02:05:19.400]   Would that be a good alternative?
[02:05:19.400 --> 02:05:25.160]   So and Micah pointed out that because I had Kevin try Hoobs because that's a home bridge
[02:05:25.160 --> 02:05:27.600]   connection.
[02:05:27.600 --> 02:05:31.840]   With Hoobs, you still need to have a Z-Wave radio if you want to bring a Z-Wave device
[02:05:31.840 --> 02:05:33.000]   in.
[02:05:33.000 --> 02:05:35.360]   So that's a note.
[02:05:35.360 --> 02:05:37.360]   And the same with all of these.
[02:05:37.360 --> 02:05:39.640]   So there's home assistant.
[02:05:39.640 --> 02:05:42.520]   But you could buy the Hoobs for $169.
[02:05:42.520 --> 02:05:43.720]   Does that include the Z-Wave radio?
[02:05:43.720 --> 02:05:45.200]   Yeah, but that doesn't have a Z-Wave radio.
[02:05:45.200 --> 02:05:47.400]   Oh, you still have to get a separate radio.
[02:05:47.400 --> 02:05:48.400]   Yeah.
[02:05:48.400 --> 02:05:53.200]   So both home assistant, OpenHab, and HomeBridge or Hoobs, you're going to have to buy them.
[02:05:53.200 --> 02:05:55.800]   Yeah, that's the other thing I told them about OpenHab.
[02:05:55.800 --> 02:05:56.800]   I didn't know about the DONGL.
[02:05:56.800 --> 02:05:59.880]   But I just said, running your own server, you wouldn't have to worry if they go out of
[02:05:59.880 --> 02:06:01.040]   business, right?
[02:06:01.040 --> 02:06:02.280]   I feel like you should run.
[02:06:02.280 --> 02:06:05.480]   If you're going to do anything, run Home Assistant because there's more people.
[02:06:05.480 --> 02:06:06.480]   I like OpenHab.
[02:06:06.480 --> 02:06:07.480]   I abused it.
[02:06:07.480 --> 02:06:08.640]   It was kind of a trial.
[02:06:08.640 --> 02:06:11.000]   But it has the biggest community.
[02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:17.000]   And when you're working with drivers for weird devices, having a large community really helps
[02:06:17.000 --> 02:06:19.000]   when you're trying to troubleshoot.
[02:06:19.000 --> 02:06:20.000]   Home assistant.
[02:06:20.000 --> 02:06:21.600]   And can you do your own hardware?
[02:06:21.600 --> 02:06:22.880]   Do you have to buy there?
[02:06:22.880 --> 02:06:24.040]   You could do your own hardware.
[02:06:24.040 --> 02:06:25.840]   They have a device called the Home Assistant Blue.
[02:06:25.840 --> 02:06:29.440]   And the blue is actually very powerful.
[02:06:29.440 --> 02:06:32.120]   And this you don't need to buy a DONGL?
[02:06:32.120 --> 02:06:33.880]   You do still need to buy a DONGL.
[02:06:33.880 --> 02:06:34.880]   Oh, you still need a DONGL.
[02:06:34.880 --> 02:06:35.880]   Sorry.
[02:06:35.880 --> 02:06:36.880]   How much is a DONGL?
[02:06:36.880 --> 02:06:37.880]   Come on.
[02:06:37.880 --> 02:06:38.880]   How hard can that be?
[02:06:38.880 --> 02:06:39.880]   Ehh.
[02:06:39.880 --> 02:06:44.040]   It's a Z-Wave DONGL that has a Z-Wave radio in it so that you can control.
[02:06:44.040 --> 02:06:46.520]   If you don't have an Z-Wave, you don't have to worry about it, right?
[02:06:46.520 --> 02:06:47.520]   Yeah.
[02:06:47.520 --> 02:06:49.400]   And if you don't have any Z-Wave, then...
[02:06:49.400 --> 02:06:50.400]   Or...
[02:06:50.400 --> 02:06:51.400]   Yeah.
[02:06:51.400 --> 02:06:55.000]   If you don't have a Z-Wave dump, wink tomorrow, like today, yesterday, get it out of your
[02:06:55.000 --> 02:06:56.000]   house.
[02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:57.000]   So was that the purpose of...
[02:06:57.000 --> 02:07:00.600]   The purpose of wink is to bridge Z-Wave to Zigbee and the others?
[02:07:00.600 --> 02:07:05.120]   So, wink when it came out was actually really cool because it had Wi-Fi Bluetooth to be
[02:07:05.120 --> 02:07:06.800]   and Z-Wave, which was all the major...
[02:07:06.800 --> 02:07:07.800]   Right.
[02:07:07.800 --> 02:07:08.800]   ...on radios.
[02:07:08.800 --> 02:07:10.800]   So, you know, had the Lutron Cosada.
[02:07:10.800 --> 02:07:11.800]   Right.
[02:07:11.800 --> 02:07:16.040]   So, if you didn't have the Cosada hub, which I'm pointing behind me like it's still there,
[02:07:16.040 --> 02:07:22.120]   but it's not, it was living there for a while, but if you have that, or you didn't need that
[02:07:22.120 --> 02:07:28.720]   because they had the radio raw, not raw too, they had the Cosada radio, I can't remember
[02:07:28.720 --> 02:07:35.520]   the protocol they use in that, which was really kind of very unique and super cool.
[02:07:35.520 --> 02:07:40.960]   So if I got...so here's a $45 Z-Wave USB stick.
[02:07:40.960 --> 02:07:45.640]   If I got that and stuck it into hoops or Home Assistance Blue, it would just work.
[02:07:45.640 --> 02:07:46.640]   I would...
[02:07:46.640 --> 02:07:47.640]   They would know about it.
[02:07:47.640 --> 02:07:49.240]   They would say, "Oh yeah, I see you have a Z-Wave radio.
[02:07:49.240 --> 02:07:50.240]   Do I have to...
[02:07:50.240 --> 02:07:51.240]   Do I need to...
[02:07:51.240 --> 02:07:53.400]   You're gonna have to pull a driver in for that.
[02:07:53.400 --> 02:07:55.400]   So you're gonna want to Google whatever Z-Wave...
[02:07:55.400 --> 02:07:57.080]   It does get harder and harder, yeah.
[02:07:57.080 --> 02:07:58.080]   Yeah.
[02:07:58.080 --> 02:08:02.160]   So whatever...that's why I think Home Assistance is great because they have all these lovely
[02:08:02.160 --> 02:08:04.560]   forum posts that are like, "Here are the dongles that work."
[02:08:04.560 --> 02:08:05.560]   That's what you want.
[02:08:05.560 --> 02:08:08.880]   Something that's widely supported, that's exactly right, yeah.
[02:08:08.880 --> 02:08:10.840]   And this is your own server.
[02:08:10.840 --> 02:08:15.800]   You're not connecting to somebody's third party server out there in the real world.
[02:08:15.800 --> 02:08:19.880]   All of these have the...I shouldn't say all.
[02:08:19.880 --> 02:08:24.720]   Most of these have the ability, so OpenHab, Home Assistant, and HomeBridge are your own
[02:08:24.720 --> 02:08:25.720]   server.
[02:08:25.720 --> 02:08:26.720]   That's what I thought.
[02:08:26.720 --> 02:08:28.040]   That was my suggestion to the guy.
[02:08:28.040 --> 02:08:33.280]   Why depend on Wink for five bucks a month when you could do it yourself?
[02:08:33.280 --> 02:08:38.560]   The reason is because these...and they're all getting better, but none of them are as
[02:08:38.560 --> 02:08:39.560]   easy to use.
[02:08:39.560 --> 02:08:43.360]   Yeah, so it's just easy, ease of use, yeah.
[02:08:43.360 --> 02:08:44.360]   Well...
[02:08:44.360 --> 02:08:47.840]   Home Assistant Blue just came out in December.
[02:08:47.840 --> 02:08:50.720]   So they're gradually moving.
[02:08:50.720 --> 02:08:55.440]   The problem with all of this is you have the super nerds who want to configure everything
[02:08:55.440 --> 02:08:57.360]   and spend a lot of time on it.
[02:08:57.360 --> 02:09:01.160]   But then you have everybody else who's like, "Look, I just want to set up a movie thing
[02:09:01.160 --> 02:09:08.680]   and I want to spend like 15 minutes setting up my movie night setup and that's it."
[02:09:08.680 --> 02:09:13.440]   As you meet those people, you leave the other people behind.
[02:09:13.440 --> 02:09:18.840]   Here's a company that sells...so they don't sell...
[02:09:18.840 --> 02:09:22.600]   Who's the company?
[02:09:22.600 --> 02:09:25.400]   I'm looking at the blue.
[02:09:25.400 --> 02:09:28.320]   The Home Assistant Blue bundle is sold by a variety of companies.
[02:09:28.320 --> 02:09:31.240]   Here's one Ameradroid.
[02:09:31.240 --> 02:09:34.320]   It's the only one in the US.
[02:09:34.320 --> 02:09:37.200]   And this is the bundle that they sell for an official.
[02:09:37.200 --> 02:09:39.920]   Now, yeah, some people might have a bundle with a...
[02:09:39.920 --> 02:09:41.560]   Yeah, that's what I'm wondering.
[02:09:41.560 --> 02:09:46.640]   Yeah, this includes a whole bunch of additional little things, including Shelly stuff.
[02:09:46.640 --> 02:09:50.200]   Oh, that's a whole automation package.
[02:09:50.200 --> 02:09:51.200]   Yeah.
[02:09:51.200 --> 02:09:53.160]   I think some Shelly stuff come in today.
[02:09:53.160 --> 02:09:56.560]   But new orders expected to ship in April.
[02:09:56.560 --> 02:09:57.560]   So...
[02:09:57.560 --> 02:10:01.840]   You're going to be offline for a while.
[02:10:01.840 --> 02:10:02.840]   Wink might be...
[02:10:02.840 --> 02:10:04.280]   I'm not online now if you're with Wink.
[02:10:04.280 --> 02:10:05.280]   Wink might be back.
[02:10:05.280 --> 02:10:08.360]   No, you might be because it says, "I'm looking at February 3rd.
[02:10:08.360 --> 02:10:09.640]   They posted on their website.
[02:10:09.640 --> 02:10:10.640]   That's today.
[02:10:10.640 --> 02:10:12.760]   A fix has been implemented and we are monitoring the results.
[02:10:12.760 --> 02:10:14.600]   Most hubs are back online.
[02:10:14.600 --> 02:10:16.560]   So 10 days later, they're back online.
[02:10:16.560 --> 02:10:18.480]   But that does not give one confidence.
[02:10:18.480 --> 02:10:21.760]   If for 10 days, you can't turn on your lights, open your blinds.
[02:10:21.760 --> 02:10:25.720]   So you could always do local stuff and to be clear, is it local?
[02:10:25.720 --> 02:10:27.520]   They said, "Don't unplug your hub.
[02:10:27.520 --> 02:10:33.800]   Because if you unplug it, then it has to be authorized before you get local control again."
[02:10:33.800 --> 02:10:37.520]   So they said, "Local control is not affected, but don't unplug."
[02:10:37.520 --> 02:10:38.840]   That's not a good solution.
[02:10:38.840 --> 02:10:44.480]   And for everyone who's arguing for the clapper, I think that's actually a wonderful product.
[02:10:44.480 --> 02:10:45.480]   I'm not kidding.
[02:10:45.480 --> 02:10:46.480]   Clap on?
[02:10:46.480 --> 02:10:47.480]   There's no joke about it.
[02:10:47.480 --> 02:10:48.480]   Clap off.
[02:10:48.480 --> 02:10:49.480]   Yes.
[02:10:49.480 --> 02:10:50.480]   Wow.
[02:10:50.480 --> 02:10:53.680]   That's how far we've come in home automation in the last 50 years.
[02:10:53.680 --> 02:10:57.480]   Basically, a lot of it is a more expensive clapper with tech.
[02:10:57.480 --> 02:10:58.480]   It's with software glitches.
[02:10:58.480 --> 02:11:01.000]   That's why I'm not going to ever do this.
[02:11:01.000 --> 02:11:03.000]   I've learned my lesson.
[02:11:03.000 --> 02:11:04.000]   Okay.
[02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:06.320]   So that's some very good advice.
[02:11:06.320 --> 02:11:09.440]   I'm so glad you brought this up because I had meant to ask you about it.
[02:11:09.440 --> 02:11:13.320]   Actually, it was one of the first things I wanted to ask you because of this question.
[02:11:13.320 --> 02:11:17.840]   There is a full article about all of this at StaceyOnIOT.com.
[02:11:17.840 --> 02:11:21.640]   Where have all the smart home hubs gone?
[02:11:21.640 --> 02:11:22.640]   And...
[02:11:22.640 --> 02:11:24.440]   Oh, in the time I've seen...
[02:11:24.440 --> 02:11:25.440]   Oh, my gosh.
[02:11:25.440 --> 02:11:28.040]   That's like my car trips when I was a kid with my parents.
[02:11:28.040 --> 02:11:29.040]   Oh, God.
[02:11:29.040 --> 02:11:31.680]   ♪ Come by, I'm alone ♪
[02:11:31.680 --> 02:11:34.120]   ♪ Come by, I'm alone ♪
[02:11:34.120 --> 02:11:35.120]   Yes.
[02:11:35.120 --> 02:11:38.640]   So you have every one of them here and pros and cons on each and links and so forth.
[02:11:38.640 --> 02:11:40.760]   So that's really a great article.
[02:11:40.760 --> 02:11:44.920]   I'm glad you wrote that and I will mention that on the radio show this weekend because
[02:11:44.920 --> 02:11:47.040]   I gave Leo's half-assed answer.
[02:11:47.040 --> 02:11:48.040]   This is...
[02:11:48.040 --> 02:11:49.720]   Your ass is full on this one.
[02:11:49.720 --> 02:11:51.360]   Stacey's full ass answer.
[02:11:51.360 --> 02:11:52.360]   That's wrong.
[02:11:52.360 --> 02:11:55.400]   I better switch over to Jeff Jarvis and his number of those.
[02:11:55.400 --> 02:11:56.760]   That's the week.
[02:11:56.760 --> 02:11:59.320]   So open up Ben Evans.
[02:11:59.320 --> 02:12:01.240]   I put down six slides from Ben Evans.
[02:12:01.240 --> 02:12:02.240]   Good.
[02:12:02.240 --> 02:12:03.240]   Mondo presentation.
[02:12:03.240 --> 02:12:04.600]   Yeah, I started to go through it and there's just so many slides I didn't know.
[02:12:04.600 --> 02:12:06.440]   So slide five, I'd start there.
[02:12:06.440 --> 02:12:07.440]   Okay.
[02:12:07.440 --> 02:12:08.440]   Hold on.
[02:12:08.440 --> 02:12:09.440]   Hold on.
[02:12:09.440 --> 02:12:10.440]   Give me a moment.
[02:12:10.440 --> 02:12:11.440]   Give me a moment.
[02:12:11.440 --> 02:12:12.440]   I'm finding the link.
[02:12:12.440 --> 02:12:13.600]   What happened?
[02:12:13.600 --> 02:12:15.480]   I put it down in my numbers.
[02:12:15.480 --> 02:12:16.880]   Oh, you put it in the...
[02:12:16.880 --> 02:12:17.880]   Oh, okay.
[02:12:17.880 --> 02:12:19.680]   I was going to give you a line number, but you...
[02:12:19.680 --> 02:12:20.680]   Oh, you moved it.
[02:12:20.680 --> 02:12:21.680]   You moved it.
[02:12:21.680 --> 02:12:22.680]   That's what happened.
[02:12:22.680 --> 02:12:23.920]   No, I knew where it was earlier.
[02:12:23.920 --> 02:12:24.920]   I had it open.
[02:12:24.920 --> 02:12:25.920]   Okay.
[02:12:25.920 --> 02:12:26.920]   Slide five.
[02:12:26.920 --> 02:12:27.920]   Five.
[02:12:27.920 --> 02:12:28.920]   Five.
[02:12:28.920 --> 02:12:29.920]   Five.
[02:12:29.920 --> 02:12:30.920]   Of the great, un-bundling.
[02:12:30.920 --> 02:12:33.560]   So E-commerce steps forward five to ten years.
[02:12:33.560 --> 02:12:39.920]   The pandemic accelerated E-commerce by half a decade to a decade.
[02:12:39.920 --> 02:12:40.920]   And I don't think it's going to revert.
[02:12:40.920 --> 02:12:42.920]   I think this is the new normal.
[02:12:42.920 --> 02:12:43.920]   Yeah.
[02:12:43.920 --> 02:12:44.920]   No.
[02:12:44.920 --> 02:12:46.920]   On to seven, you can go one at a time if you want.
[02:12:46.920 --> 02:12:47.920]   Seven.
[02:12:47.920 --> 02:12:48.920]   Online grocery sales.
[02:12:48.920 --> 02:12:49.920]   Forward.
[02:12:49.920 --> 02:12:50.920]   Double.
[02:12:50.920 --> 02:12:51.920]   Double.
[02:12:51.920 --> 02:12:52.920]   Wow.
[02:12:52.920 --> 02:12:53.920]   This is user cave.
[02:12:53.920 --> 02:12:54.920]   That's the change.
[02:12:54.920 --> 02:12:55.920]   This is the UK numbers.
[02:12:55.920 --> 02:12:57.920]   Yeah, it's supposed to be going to change.
[02:12:57.920 --> 02:12:58.920]   Yeah.
[02:12:58.920 --> 02:12:59.920]   Slide nine.
[02:12:59.920 --> 02:13:00.920]   Mm-hmm.
[02:13:00.920 --> 02:13:03.680]   But I'm glad you're not telling me line numbers.
[02:13:03.680 --> 02:13:04.680]   This is so much better.
[02:13:04.680 --> 02:13:07.920]   I know it's why I don't want to...
[02:13:07.920 --> 02:13:09.920]   I don't want to hold it.
[02:13:09.920 --> 02:13:10.920]   Do you?
[02:13:10.920 --> 02:13:14.920]   So proportion of adults making video calls, at least weekly, right?
[02:13:14.920 --> 02:13:16.920]   Any is now about 70%...
[02:13:16.920 --> 02:13:21.400]   You think UK reflects, though, use in the United States like, "I don't think this is
[02:13:21.400 --> 02:13:22.400]   going to be the same."
[02:13:22.400 --> 02:13:23.400]   I think we're bigger.
[02:13:23.400 --> 02:13:27.320]   But I don't even know if the platforms would be the same.
[02:13:27.320 --> 02:13:29.920]   What's up is definitely going to be lower in the US, France.
[02:13:29.920 --> 02:13:30.920]   Yes, absolutely true.
[02:13:30.920 --> 02:13:32.480]   I've got a question about that.
[02:13:32.480 --> 02:13:35.760]   Who wasn't face timing or doing anything like that?
[02:13:35.760 --> 02:13:39.320]   I mean, we were all making video calls before the pandemic, right?
[02:13:39.320 --> 02:13:41.400]   No, you young whippersnappers maybe.
[02:13:41.400 --> 02:13:42.400]   But not also.
[02:13:42.400 --> 02:13:43.400]   No, yeah, no.
[02:13:43.400 --> 02:13:48.520]   In fact, even with young people, it was hard to get people to do video calls.
[02:13:48.520 --> 02:13:49.520]   It was hard.
[02:13:49.520 --> 02:13:50.520]   We were so used to it now.
[02:13:50.520 --> 02:13:54.520]   It was a grandparent thing that I'm just like, "Oh."
[02:13:54.520 --> 02:13:55.520]   I think it's your business.
[02:13:55.520 --> 02:13:57.160]   I mean, I didn't spend all day on them.
[02:13:57.160 --> 02:13:59.160]   No, but I think it's your basic, the difference is...
[02:13:59.160 --> 02:14:00.160]   It's in particular.
[02:14:00.160 --> 02:14:02.160]   You were working on a business, supposed to family.
[02:14:02.160 --> 02:14:03.160]   Yeah.
[02:14:03.160 --> 02:14:04.160]   This is business calls.
[02:14:04.160 --> 02:14:05.160]   Okay.
[02:14:05.160 --> 02:14:06.160]   This is what made the huge change.
[02:14:06.160 --> 02:14:07.160]   Business.
[02:14:07.160 --> 02:14:08.160]   Slide 23.
[02:14:08.160 --> 02:14:09.160]   See, I jumped ahead of here.
[02:14:09.160 --> 02:14:10.160]   Oh my God.
[02:14:10.160 --> 02:14:11.160]   I don't know if I can get there.
[02:14:11.160 --> 02:14:12.160]   Okay.
[02:14:12.160 --> 02:14:13.160]   You stop it and you want.
[02:14:13.160 --> 02:14:14.160]   No.
[02:14:14.160 --> 02:14:18.680]   Amazon now delivering a third of the parcels in the US.
[02:14:18.680 --> 02:14:19.880]   This is US, okay.
[02:14:19.880 --> 02:14:23.760]   Basically, almost equal to the post office.
[02:14:23.760 --> 02:14:26.200]   Just phenomenal to me.
[02:14:26.200 --> 02:14:28.920]   Slide 26.
[02:14:28.920 --> 02:14:31.520]   Delivery employment has already doubled.
[02:14:31.520 --> 02:14:32.520]   Crappy jobs.
[02:14:32.520 --> 02:14:33.520]   Yeah.
[02:14:33.520 --> 02:14:34.520]   Well, they exist.
[02:14:34.520 --> 02:14:35.520]   They're jobs.
[02:14:35.520 --> 02:14:36.520]   Where has...
[02:14:36.520 --> 02:14:39.280]   Where is the red line and...
[02:14:39.280 --> 02:14:41.760]   The black line and delivery is the red line.
[02:14:41.760 --> 02:14:43.560]   So both have gone up.
[02:14:43.560 --> 02:14:45.040]   33.
[02:14:45.040 --> 02:14:46.800]   After we were extolling...
[02:14:46.800 --> 02:14:48.800]   No, no, 33.
[02:14:48.800 --> 02:14:49.800]   Here, 33.
[02:14:49.800 --> 02:14:50.800]   Bingo.
[02:14:50.800 --> 02:14:56.440]   I have Bingo.
[02:14:56.440 --> 02:14:58.040]   Who needs Amazon?
[02:14:58.040 --> 02:14:59.040]   Shopify goes direct.
[02:14:59.040 --> 02:15:00.040]   This is interesting.
[02:15:00.040 --> 02:15:02.360]   We were extolling Amazon before.
[02:15:02.360 --> 02:15:08.960]   But here he has numbers to show that in 2020, Shopify has grown considerably because
[02:15:08.960 --> 02:15:12.200]   it's merchants wanting to go around Amazon and not be stuck with Amazon.
[02:15:12.200 --> 02:15:15.440]   Does Shopify do fulfillment?
[02:15:15.440 --> 02:15:16.440]   Or just the...
[02:15:16.440 --> 02:15:18.160]   I'm pretty surprised to ask you a question about it.
[02:15:18.160 --> 02:15:20.840]   But that's the thing about Amazon is soup to nuts.
[02:15:20.840 --> 02:15:21.840]   They do the fulfillment.
[02:15:21.840 --> 02:15:22.840]   They do everything.
[02:15:22.840 --> 02:15:23.840]   Yeah.
[02:15:23.840 --> 02:15:25.640]   I understand what you would want to get out from under that.
[02:15:25.640 --> 02:15:28.040]   Stores have the fulfillment.
[02:15:28.040 --> 02:15:31.640]   The next slide, the arguments against, no one could beat with Amazon.
[02:15:31.640 --> 02:15:35.160]   Wasn't this all already solved, but brands and consumers are ready to go direct.
[02:15:35.160 --> 02:15:40.040]   Now, when I've worked with publishers who are doing e-commerce, the consumers really
[02:15:40.040 --> 02:15:44.760]   want Amazon and they really want Prime and ready for Prime free delivery.
[02:15:44.760 --> 02:15:45.760]   But we'll see.
[02:15:45.760 --> 02:15:49.760]   And the final Shopify is building fulfillment, by the way.
[02:15:49.760 --> 02:15:55.720]   And I bet you they have third party fulfillment tools that you could probably use.
[02:15:55.720 --> 02:16:00.520]   And then so he says later that for electric cars, and of course we have the GM announcement,
[02:16:00.520 --> 02:16:04.240]   we have all the stuff going on with electric cars, the batteries are still going to have
[02:16:04.240 --> 02:16:07.520]   to come down a third in price for this really to work.
[02:16:07.520 --> 02:16:09.520]   But then on slide 71...
[02:16:09.520 --> 02:16:11.800]   Good Lord.
[02:16:11.800 --> 02:16:14.880]   He presents the electric fairy.
[02:16:14.880 --> 02:16:17.760]   The electric fairy.
[02:16:17.760 --> 02:16:18.760]   Nice.
[02:16:18.760 --> 02:16:22.120]   Oh, Washington State's actually looking at those.
[02:16:22.120 --> 02:16:23.120]   I wish they would get on.
[02:16:23.120 --> 02:16:24.120]   That's awesome.
[02:16:24.120 --> 02:16:25.120]   I would imagine so.
[02:16:25.120 --> 02:16:26.120]   Yeah.
[02:16:26.120 --> 02:16:27.120]   Cool.
[02:16:27.120 --> 02:16:28.120]   Because they're quieter, so like we're all...
[02:16:28.120 --> 02:16:31.600]   There's a whole thing about the orcas being upset because they'll build out engine noises.
[02:16:31.600 --> 02:16:33.520]   Oh, but you know what they're going to say then.
[02:16:33.520 --> 02:16:36.840]   Well, the orcas are happy, but the dolphins don't like the high-pitched wine from the
[02:16:36.840 --> 02:16:39.080]   dynamos.
[02:16:39.080 --> 02:16:41.600]   You know what they're going to do.
[02:16:41.600 --> 02:16:42.600]   We don't have dolphins up here.
[02:16:42.600 --> 02:16:43.600]   We don't care about the orcas.
[02:16:43.600 --> 02:16:47.120]   Orca's and Wales.
[02:16:47.120 --> 02:16:48.120]   That's all we care about.
[02:16:48.120 --> 02:16:49.120]   Orca's and Wales.
[02:16:49.120 --> 02:16:50.320]   They get pissed off with the rain.
[02:16:50.320 --> 02:16:51.320]   It's just too much rain.
[02:16:51.320 --> 02:16:52.320]   They can't take it.
[02:16:52.320 --> 02:16:53.320]   Yeah.
[02:16:53.320 --> 02:16:54.320]   It's so wet.
[02:16:54.320 --> 02:16:59.200]   How have you know it was sunny today and I spent all the sunshine hours with y'all?
[02:16:59.200 --> 02:17:01.640]   Oh, Stacy, you can quit any time.
[02:17:01.640 --> 02:17:03.560]   I'm not going to make you do this show anymore.
[02:17:03.560 --> 02:17:04.560]   You can...
[02:17:04.560 --> 02:17:06.560]   Honestly, I feel terrible.
[02:17:06.560 --> 02:17:07.560]   I know, I have...
[02:17:07.560 --> 02:17:11.200]   So, this is partly a persona thing, but it is...
[02:17:11.200 --> 02:17:12.680]   Like I enjoy hanging out with y'all.
[02:17:12.680 --> 02:17:15.840]   I just have a hard time sitting still for you.
[02:17:15.840 --> 02:17:16.840]   What?
[02:17:16.840 --> 02:17:19.280]   Do you have a recording of that, John?
[02:17:19.280 --> 02:17:20.280]   I'm recording of that, John.
[02:17:20.280 --> 02:17:21.280]   Record.
[02:17:21.280 --> 02:17:22.280]   Okay.
[02:17:22.280 --> 02:17:23.280]   It's recorded.
[02:17:23.280 --> 02:17:24.280]   Yeah, can you make a...
[02:17:24.280 --> 02:17:27.280]   John, do you think you're supposed to record this, John?
[02:17:27.280 --> 02:17:28.280]   It's...
[02:17:28.280 --> 02:17:32.200]   What's your thing?
[02:17:32.200 --> 02:17:33.720]   My thing is...
[02:17:33.720 --> 02:17:36.120]   I'm very proud.
[02:17:36.120 --> 02:17:38.200]   Oh, I'm so happy for you.
[02:17:38.200 --> 02:17:39.200]   Have you...
[02:17:39.200 --> 02:17:40.200]   Moment.
[02:17:40.200 --> 02:17:41.200]   I'm so happy for you.
[02:17:41.200 --> 02:17:46.600]   This is a crazy time, but it is a hard hit.
[02:17:46.600 --> 02:17:54.160]   His officially signed his letter of intent to go to college and run track at Pacific...
[02:17:54.160 --> 02:17:55.160]   Not for city.
[02:17:55.160 --> 02:17:59.000]   He's a football player too, but he's also a very fast runner.
[02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:00.000]   So, what is he...
[02:18:00.000 --> 02:18:01.000]   There he goes.
[02:18:01.000 --> 02:18:02.000]   Look at him.
[02:18:02.000 --> 02:18:03.000]   Wow.
[02:18:03.000 --> 02:18:05.360]   So, I put a little clip together of some of his old footage.
[02:18:05.360 --> 02:18:06.360]   Oh, that's a cool one.
[02:18:06.360 --> 02:18:07.360]   That's a cool one.
[02:18:07.360 --> 02:18:08.360]   Aren't you sweet?
[02:18:08.360 --> 02:18:09.360]   And a...
[02:18:09.360 --> 02:18:10.360]   What a daddy.
[02:18:10.360 --> 02:18:11.360]   Quite proud.
[02:18:11.360 --> 02:18:12.360]   Wow.
[02:18:12.360 --> 02:18:14.360]   Been waiting on this for a long time.
[02:18:14.360 --> 02:18:16.360]   Long, long, long time.
[02:18:16.360 --> 02:18:17.360]   So, yeah.
[02:18:17.360 --> 02:18:18.360]   Is he gonna major in...
[02:18:18.360 --> 02:18:19.360]   Shut up.
[02:18:19.360 --> 02:18:20.600]   What's he gonna major in?
[02:18:20.600 --> 02:18:22.160]   Does he know?
[02:18:22.160 --> 02:18:23.160]   Kinesiology.
[02:18:23.160 --> 02:18:24.160]   Oh, that's good.
[02:18:24.160 --> 02:18:25.160]   Kinesiology.
[02:18:25.160 --> 02:18:28.760]   Oh, is this him signing the letter of intent?
[02:18:28.760 --> 02:18:29.760]   Yes, sir.
[02:18:29.760 --> 02:18:30.760]   Oh.
[02:18:30.760 --> 02:18:35.360]   Pacific University in Oregon.
[02:18:35.360 --> 02:18:38.040]   Oh, he's not gonna be too far away either.
[02:18:38.040 --> 02:18:39.040]   That's wonderful.
[02:18:39.040 --> 02:18:40.040]   That's wonderful.
[02:18:40.040 --> 02:18:41.040]   That's really great.
[02:18:41.040 --> 02:18:42.040]   That's really great.
[02:18:42.040 --> 02:18:48.000]   He was considering a couple of different places down in LA and then even got accepted at some
[02:18:48.000 --> 02:18:52.560]   schools and back in the Charlotte area and I said, "No."
[02:18:52.560 --> 02:18:53.560]   Good.
[02:18:53.560 --> 02:18:54.560]   I'm happy there.
[02:18:54.560 --> 02:18:55.560]   It's on West Poster now.
[02:18:55.560 --> 02:18:58.040]   So, I'm so happy for him.
[02:18:58.040 --> 02:18:59.040]   That's fantastic.
[02:18:59.040 --> 02:19:00.040]   Congratulations.
[02:19:00.040 --> 02:19:01.040]   What is he running?
[02:19:01.040 --> 02:19:02.040]   What...
[02:19:02.040 --> 02:19:06.720]   He's a quarter-miler and he can run the 800-2, but he's a quarter-miler.
[02:19:06.720 --> 02:19:09.880]   And he's gonna be a boxer.
[02:19:09.880 --> 02:19:10.880]   Yep.
[02:19:10.880 --> 02:19:11.880]   He's a boxer.
[02:19:11.880 --> 02:19:12.880]   Yeah.
[02:19:12.880 --> 02:19:13.880]   Oh, boxer.
[02:19:13.880 --> 02:19:14.880]   Sooo...
[02:19:14.880 --> 02:19:15.880]   Boxers.
[02:19:15.880 --> 02:19:16.880]   I found a question.
[02:19:16.880 --> 02:19:21.200]   Awesome that he's a quarter-miler because that seems to be the thing in our family because
[02:19:21.200 --> 02:19:25.040]   I ran the quarter-mile, even though I was a hurdler, but I also ran the quarter-mile.
[02:19:25.040 --> 02:19:26.040]   Oh, you're a kid?
[02:19:26.040 --> 02:19:27.040]   And my dad ran the quarter-mile.
[02:19:27.040 --> 02:19:28.040]   Oh, my God.
[02:19:28.040 --> 02:19:30.040]   He's a third-generation quarter-miler.
[02:19:30.040 --> 02:19:31.040]   Yeah.
[02:19:31.040 --> 02:19:32.040]   Wow.
[02:19:32.040 --> 02:19:33.040]   That's pretty cool.
[02:19:33.040 --> 02:19:34.840]   Can I ask you to do a question?
[02:19:34.840 --> 02:19:35.840]   Kinesiology.
[02:19:35.840 --> 02:19:38.440]   The study of movement and things.
[02:19:38.440 --> 02:19:39.960]   What do you mean what do you do with that?
[02:19:39.960 --> 02:19:40.960]   For sports.
[02:19:40.960 --> 02:19:41.960]   For sports.
[02:19:41.960 --> 02:19:44.960]   Is it coaching, training...
[02:19:44.960 --> 02:19:45.960]   It's a trainer.
[02:19:45.960 --> 02:19:46.960]   I could have started with this.
[02:19:46.960 --> 02:19:49.480]   He's also for like physical therapy.
[02:19:49.480 --> 02:19:50.480]   R.P.
[02:19:50.480 --> 02:19:51.480]   Yeah.
[02:19:51.480 --> 02:19:52.480]   There would be.
[02:19:52.480 --> 02:19:53.480]   Okay.
[02:19:53.480 --> 02:19:54.480]   Right.
[02:19:54.480 --> 02:19:55.480]   Okay.
[02:19:55.480 --> 02:19:56.480]   Got it.
[02:19:56.480 --> 02:19:57.480]   Does he want to be a trainer when he grows up?
[02:19:57.480 --> 02:19:58.480]   Yes, he does.
[02:19:58.480 --> 02:19:59.480]   Yes, he does.
[02:19:59.480 --> 02:20:00.480]   That would be cool.
[02:20:00.480 --> 02:20:01.480]   That's another weird thing.
[02:20:01.480 --> 02:20:02.480]   I started out college as a sports medicine major.
[02:20:02.480 --> 02:20:03.480]   No, kid.
[02:20:03.480 --> 02:20:04.480]   Really?
[02:20:04.480 --> 02:20:07.040]   Well, you've been a good influence.
[02:20:07.040 --> 02:20:08.040]   Good, good influence.
[02:20:08.040 --> 02:20:10.160]   What did you end up studying that, Ant?
[02:20:10.160 --> 02:20:11.160]   IT.
[02:20:11.160 --> 02:20:12.160]   Oh, okay.
[02:20:12.160 --> 02:20:13.160]   He's an IT.
[02:20:13.160 --> 02:20:14.160]   God.
[02:20:14.160 --> 02:20:15.160]   The rest is history.
[02:20:15.160 --> 02:20:16.160]   Yes.
[02:20:16.160 --> 02:20:20.120]   Don't forget Ants Show, Hands On Photography, Twitter.tv/HOP.
[02:20:20.120 --> 02:20:23.400]   And Ant would like you to review it on Apple Podcasts.
[02:20:23.400 --> 02:20:24.400]   That's right.
[02:20:24.400 --> 02:20:26.600]   And give five big stars.
[02:20:26.600 --> 02:20:28.000]   Let's get them in there.
[02:20:28.000 --> 02:20:29.000]   Let's bring them.
[02:20:29.000 --> 02:20:30.000]   Yeah.
[02:20:30.000 --> 02:20:31.000]   I'll do it, Ant.
[02:20:31.000 --> 02:20:38.480]   So, Rosemary Orchard on our iOS Today show made a very nice video on how to leave a
[02:20:38.480 --> 02:20:41.000]   review on Apple Podcasts.
[02:20:41.000 --> 02:20:42.000]   Where is that?
[02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:44.840]   Is that on our feed somewhere?
[02:20:44.840 --> 02:20:46.640]   It's on our YouTube channel.
[02:20:46.640 --> 02:20:47.640]   Okay.
[02:20:47.640 --> 02:20:49.200]   It's a Twitbit.
[02:20:49.200 --> 02:20:53.680]   So if you go to the Twitbit, youtube.com/twit.
[02:20:53.680 --> 02:20:58.840]   And there's a little video with a wonderful, by the way, we welcome Rosemary taking over
[02:20:58.840 --> 02:21:02.600]   my seat on iOS Today.
[02:21:02.600 --> 02:21:07.200]   She does a great job, but she also made a video to make it a little easier for you to
[02:21:07.200 --> 02:21:10.280]   vote for our shows.
[02:21:10.280 --> 02:21:15.440]   We played the hop rerun this morning when I was leaving the studio after Floss Weekly
[02:21:15.440 --> 02:21:21.880]   and Mr. John was giving me a hard time because in my preamble for hop, I reference, "Hey,
[02:21:21.880 --> 02:21:26.280]   go to the Apple Podcasts or iTunes for you older folks."
[02:21:26.280 --> 02:21:27.840]   Because that's what we know it as.
[02:21:27.840 --> 02:21:28.840]   It's not Apple Podcasts.
[02:21:28.840 --> 02:21:36.920]   Yeah, I call it iTunes, which is meaningless to anybody who's not using Windows, but still,
[02:21:36.920 --> 02:21:38.560]   you know where it is.
[02:21:38.560 --> 02:21:40.000]   You know, Apple Podcasts.
[02:21:40.000 --> 02:21:41.280]   That's probably the best.
[02:21:41.280 --> 02:21:44.640]   Actually, I don't think it is on our Twitbit.
[02:21:44.640 --> 02:21:46.640]   I don't know where it is.
[02:21:46.640 --> 02:21:47.800]   I don't see it on our Twitter.
[02:21:47.800 --> 02:21:49.440]   I saw it somewhere.
[02:21:49.440 --> 02:21:50.440]   Maybe it was Instagram.
[02:21:50.440 --> 02:21:51.600]   I saw it because I saw it.
[02:21:51.600 --> 02:21:53.280]   Oh, it's probably on our Instagram feed.
[02:21:53.280 --> 02:21:54.280]   You know what?
[02:21:54.280 --> 02:21:55.280]   That's I bet where it is.
[02:21:55.280 --> 02:21:58.760]   I'm going to go to the YouTube channel.
[02:21:58.760 --> 02:22:01.560]   I'm going to go to the YouTube channel.
[02:22:01.560 --> 02:22:03.560]   I'm going to go to the YouTube channel.

[02:24:05.920 --> 02:24:09.080]   Yeah, I think it was without the E. Believe me.
[02:24:09.080 --> 02:24:09.640]   I--
[02:24:09.640 --> 02:24:10.160]   No.
[02:24:10.160 --> 02:24:11.680]   I struggled with this.
[02:24:11.680 --> 02:24:12.960]   Yeah, your whole life.
[02:24:12.960 --> 02:24:13.920]   Your whole life is struggled.

[02:24:18.640 --> 02:24:19.400]   No, you should.
[02:24:19.400 --> 02:24:19.920]   It's going to happen.
[02:24:19.920 --> 02:24:21.520]   Yeah, you should.

[02:24:27.360 --> 02:24:28.760]   Oh, I love that.
[02:24:28.760 --> 02:24:29.960]   But how would you spell that?
[02:24:29.960 --> 02:24:31.400]   No one knows.
[02:24:31.400 --> 02:24:32.320]   But that would be a really--
[02:24:32.320 --> 02:24:33.640]   I think name used to be Shiggy.
[02:24:33.640 --> 02:24:33.640]   Shiggy.
[02:24:33.640 --> 02:24:33.640]   Shiggy.

[02:25:05.680 --> 02:25:07.640]   This week is kachio e pepe week as a result.
[02:25:07.640 --> 02:25:12.440]   I got a new result for pharaoh-based kachio e pepe.
[02:25:12.440 --> 02:25:13.480]   What?
[02:25:13.480 --> 02:25:14.600]   You know what pharaoh is?
[02:25:14.600 --> 02:25:15.440]   It's a wheat.
[02:25:15.440 --> 02:25:16.440]   It's a grain.
[02:25:16.440 --> 02:25:17.600]   It's a grain.
[02:25:17.600 --> 02:25:18.920]   It's better for you than pasta.
[02:25:18.920 --> 02:25:20.200]   Yeah, but I'm afraid you're missing what you're--
[02:25:20.200 --> 02:25:20.560]   It's crunchy.
[02:25:20.560 --> 02:25:23.040]   And if you put apple cider in, you cook your pharaoh
[02:25:23.040 --> 02:25:24.960]   with apple cider, it's lovely on salads.
[02:25:24.960 --> 02:25:25.960]   Mm-hmm.
[02:25:25.960 --> 02:25:26.760]   Oh, that's not--
[02:25:26.760 --> 02:25:27.600]   It's not a spatatua pepe.
[02:25:27.600 --> 02:25:28.960]   --and spinach.
[02:25:28.960 --> 02:25:32.480]   But the same thing because the kachio e pepe also
[02:25:32.480 --> 02:25:34.120]   has that tangy tartness--
[02:25:34.120 --> 02:25:35.080]   Yeah.

[02:25:53.600 --> 02:25:54.440]   Where did I see that?
[02:25:54.440 --> 02:25:55.640]   I missed it.
