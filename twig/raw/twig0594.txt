[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:32.120]   It's coming out of the wrong hole
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:38.520]   Back to the beginning. Oh, you're messing it up
[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:46.120]   See the name of the ship was a bully of tea the winds blew up her bow that turn a blow my bully boys blow
[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:51.800]   Soon may the women come to bring us sugar and tea and rum
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.400]   One day when the tongue is done. That's actually awesome
[00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.600]   Isn't it? Let it go
[00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:04.840]   It's from shore and down on her our right will bore a captain called all hands on swarity
[00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:09.640]   And oh soon may the weather
[00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:14.040]   Yeah
[00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:22.440]   Where do you find where do you find lyrics to this stuff? I mean how do these people know?
[00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:28.760]   I it's the well-earned song and I just searched Google. We could all do we could do it. We could do a quintet here
[00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:31.640]   All right, here's another one
[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.720]   Yeah, yeah, that's the problem is we're on Skype there on tiktok. Here. Let's go
[00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:39.880]   Is this the same song
[00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:49.080]   He's actually kind of lit
[00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:56.920]   You know what this is actually what makes tiktok pretty amazing
[00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:00.520]   Isn't it because because that's the collaborative part where you
[00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:05.800]   Add on and duet it and duet it and duet it. Yeah, right? It's pretty cool
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:10.760]   It's pretty amazing. Yeah, if you go down, you also go to I think the original one
[00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:15.160]   Uh, hold on here. So, uh, I'm in the wrong pay
[00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:19.400]   Here's I've got some from a cnet. Let's see
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.080]   Uh
[00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:24.600]   Sea shannings are taking you from wellerman to drunken sailor
[00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:29.240]   Sea shannies are attracting the attention of landlubber tiktok
[00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:33.400]   It went wild. I don't know what happened said a guy at the center of it all
[00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:36.200]   I hear is this the original that's him
[00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:42.440]   The name of the ship was a bully of t so he starts it solo
[00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:47.320]   And then other people on tiktok pick it up one guy comes back
[00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:53.800]   So one guy comes back the guy with a really deep voice. Yeah, the base he's great
[00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:57.880]   And then another one does it and another one does it and it becomes a chorus. Yeah
[00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:03.320]   Oh, and this is collaboration. Yeah, that's the thing that's that's cool about
[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:08.280]   Tiktok as people can take somebody's track. Here's one with strings. They've added strings to this
[00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:11.560]   Yes
[00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:14.520]   The
[00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:20.520]   What
[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:28.440]   All right, that's pretty awesome. I have to say that's it is
[00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:34.280]   See that right now in the public domain so you don't have to worry. Yeah, that's probably why sea shannies. Yeah
[00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:36.920]   Now here's the club ready remix
[00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:42.920]   Where's the drop here comes the drop
[00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:55.000]   I'm sick of the song already, but still it's gonna. It's gonna stay in your head for the next 24 hours
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.120]   If you and if you enjoy that kind of music
[00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:05.560]   Uh, I encourage you to listen to Stan Rogers doing Northwest Passage. Okay, it's very similar
[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:08.760]   And I love it because immediately Hank green who apparently has
[00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:15.720]   Decided tiktok is the hip place to be not youtube is is explaining the weller miss song
[00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:18.520]   Yeah, let's hear it. All right. Here we go
[00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:22.600]   Yeah, that there is sea shanty tiktok and I love that I'm on sea shanty tiktok
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:24.120]   And I hope there's there's more
[00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:27.400]   But I had some questions about this song because I listened to it with my son a bunch this weekend
[00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:33.480]   And I didn't understand all of the references in it. Now the main one. Okay. That's fine
[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:35.960]   Um, well
[00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:41.000]   I will say this I think this I like that this is not just people lip sync
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:44.120]   At least this is the most yeah, yeah, you know really
[00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:50.680]   So I wouldn't watch this because my only impression of tiktok was everybody's doing a lip sync or some sort of a
[00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:56.280]   White transition into something else to dawn and it just it just got tired. That's how it started
[00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:59.960]   That's what musically was it was just lip syncing but somehow
[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:04.120]   When they bought musically and that some and I think really the I the main
[00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:10.760]   Thing that they did right was they said royalty free you can and pop stars greed you can use our tracks
[00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:17.240]   And it's not gonna undermine our sales and that really is it's right, you know, um, have you watched?
[00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:19.080]   uh
[00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:20.600]   the
[00:09:20.600 --> 00:09:27.000]   Fran Lee bullets, uh martin scorsese documentary on netflix yet is it good? Yes. Awesome. It looks like it'd be pretty funny
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.760]   It's called pretend. It's a city. She's hysterical. Mm-hmm. But one of the things she says
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:35.720]   Oh, she's she's just like so grumpy and brilliant. She's the Lewis black before there was a black
[00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:37.720]   female version
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:40.600]   But she says the thing that's great about talent
[00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:44.360]   Is it's just sprinkled around like sand it's not
[00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:48.440]   You can't you can't earn it or learn it you're born with it
[00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:51.640]   And it's ran it's completely random
[00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:57.880]   And that's I think when I heard that I thought you know what that's true whether it's writing painting
[00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:00.360]   Ice skating playing a bass
[00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:07.400]   Throwing a football but he said or c- or c-shan, but what I realized is that's that's really where youtube tick-tock
[00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:10.280]   Really
[00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:13.080]   Is a huge thing because it is randomly scattered
[00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:19.480]   And so it's not the people who went to berkeley college of music who or signed a record company deal
[00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:23.880]   Then the old days those are the people who got we got to hear her if you were maybe in the subway you heard
[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:26.760]   Right that happy step in all the time jeff you to go in the subway
[00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:33.640]   democratization there'd be some brilliant violinist and you go what this guy's playing for a box in the subway. Yeah. Yeah
[00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:39.160]   But now you what's subway? What really? Yeah, would you play hockey?
[00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:41.480]   guitar
[00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:42.840]   Really
[00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:45.320]   You'd go down there and did you make money?
[00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:48.680]   Oh, yeah, yeah, some days I made
[00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:53.880]   Jesus one day. I think I made a hundred fifty dollars for two hours. I think we're used to oh, man
[00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:58.120]   Nice. Yeah, it was great. Yeah, the best part is because it's the subway
[00:10:58.120 --> 00:11:01.640]   You can literally play the same five songs over and over because people are just
[00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:05.720]   You don't need a repertoire a week
[00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:13.240]   Just do the times they are changing over and over and over. Wait, is that what you would do? Fuck kind of folk
[00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:18.920]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, nearly on bob dillum. Nice john prawn. Do you still do any of that?
[00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:24.520]   I do. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, I love that. See I you know when she said that I thought it's a shame
[00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:28.360]   I didn't get any talent because I would have loved it. She also said
[00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:33.160]   that musicians there's some there's no other profession
[00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:36.360]   Where people just love you
[00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:43.320]   because everybody associates a particular song with their youth or good moments in their youth or their child and so
[00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:47.960]   Musicians had unlike almost any other profession
[00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:53.400]   Have this people just love them because it's it's this memory of their youth and so worth it
[00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:57.320]   It made me sad. Yeah, you know, she she talked about it
[00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:00.440]   She plays the cello or played the cello at one point
[00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:04.360]   She said the elementary schools would you know you get a free instrument up to a certain point
[00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:07.400]   Then you have to buy your own and yeah, they took her cello back
[00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:13.000]   And her parent and she said I need a cello and parents are trying to figure out how they could buy one and find finally she goes downstairs
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   His mom dad don't buy me a cello. I will never be I will never be good at this
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.160]   It's a complete waste of your money. I don't have that talent
[00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:29.080]   Unlike what the hardhead told me in that trombone of his does he did you buy him a trombone?
[00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:35.480]   I did and he was good. He and he used it up until we got over here in in, California
[00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:41.880]   He stopped playing elsewhere. Yeah, he was focusing more on other stuff particular girls sports and white sports. Okay
[00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:46.040]   Yeah, definitely sports. Yeah girls here in a few girls
[00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:48.600]   Lots of sports
[00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:54.280]   But he was really good. I give him credit. It wasn't a total waste of my money because he was he was really good
[00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:57.080]   He was first here pretty much soon as he picked it up
[00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:59.800]   Are you sad that he didn't keep going?
[00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:03.880]   Yeah a little bit um because I like how
[00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:07.640]   Having an instrument in your hands just just keeps you busy
[00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:13.000]   You know, it's just something about the the mental health part of it too. You know
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.320]   Did he like it?
[00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:22.120]   Yeah, he loved it. He loved it. He was good and it's funny every now and then I'll catch him listening to classical music
[00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:26.360]   God, so he has appreciation. Oh, right. You know and I can remember
[00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:29.160]   just thinking back to
[00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:31.160]   When people would laugh at us
[00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:36.440]   Growing up for listening to classical music, but you know, he was he he just embraced it
[00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:42.280]   Him and him and his brother. They both enjoy jazz and classical music as well as some of the other
[00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:46.040]   Wild and crazy popular music that's all over the likes of tiktok
[00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:49.800]   So, you know, if you if you're not going to be a professional trombonist
[00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:56.600]   Learning appreciation for music and and that's a lifelong game. That's a plus. That's a plus
[00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:59.240]   So when we gathered here last week
[00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:01.320]   Uh
[00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:03.320]   It seems like a year ago
[00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:06.120]   It seems like a year ago
[00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:09.720]   The congress was being assaulted when we gathered here last week
[00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:15.880]   Um, so even though it does seem like a year ago and a lot of news has happened. We haven't talked about it on this show yet
[00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:18.520]   uh, the in the aftermath
[00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:20.280]   Um
[00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:24.440]   Facebook which had resisted this ban trump then twitter
[00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:28.840]   Which had resisted at bannum for 12 hours then finally banned him completely
[00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:33.480]   Um, so did pinterest. I didn't know the president had a big pinterest account very di-p
[00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:37.560]   Maybe he's does he's just been he was banned on youtube and then he's just got banned again
[00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:41.560]   Uh this time permanently
[00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:43.560]   um
[00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:50.360]   Apple google first said you can't put parlor on the google play store because there's too much violent
[00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:53.720]   Uh, there about too many violent posts there apple
[00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:57.880]   Initially said you got to moderate it and then finally said all right. We're pulling it
[00:14:58.520 --> 00:15:03.960]   Then amazon web services says we're not going to host it then parlors lawyers said we're not going to work for you
[00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:07.160]   Uh parlor is suing amazon
[00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:09.240]   Um
[00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:12.520]   We found out the parlor this has all happened in just in just a matter of
[00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:16.600]   Days we found out the parlor had very poor security
[00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:24.040]   And that uh hacker had downloaded pretty much the entire database including all the metadata of all the photos
[00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:29.880]   FBI's very hilarious. Yeah, it was hilarious. It barely they used a a trial version
[00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:33.240]   A free trial version of a security product
[00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:36.440]   Was that easy folks?
[00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:41.080]   Um, but before parlor was banned it leapt to number one on the app store
[00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:46.040]   Of course and had many hundreds of thousands of people sign up gab two
[00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:49.560]   Um, it's been kind of crazy
[00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:52.760]   Uh, it's been kind of nutty
[00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:54.760]   Um
[00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:57.000]   Airbnb just announced that they're going to cancel
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:04.280]   Reservations for uh airbnbs in washington dc during inauguration week. There's some concern that
[00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:08.120]   Uh activists will come back the number one video
[00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:12.600]   On twitter and and reddit was uh one
[00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:16.360]   Uh insurrectionist who went to the airport
[00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:22.200]   And found out all of a sudden he was on the no fly list and burst into tears. That was very popular
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   It's crazy
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.600]   It's crazy
[00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:31.320]   First draft news has a list of all the platforms and and what they did and when
[00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:35.080]   And it's it's everyone you can think of shopify paypal
[00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:37.240]   Twitch
[00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:39.000]   Exactly. You read it
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.040]   Yeah, so many people so many at disney are pulling
[00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:45.560]   There are donations to republic and members of congress who
[00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:48.280]   uh
[00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:50.920]   Protested uh the vote said it was uh
[00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:53.880]   A bunch of congratulate a lot of companies
[00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:55.800]   Um
[00:16:55.800 --> 00:17:00.120]   You had an interview on the bbc jeff why don't you tell us about that? I could play it, but
[00:17:00.120 --> 00:17:02.920]   Is he gone?
[00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:09.320]   I'm here in audio with the your video is like that's all right. Audio is fine. It's late. Yeah, okay. Um
[00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:12.440]   his bbc appearance
[00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:15.080]   I just have to say it
[00:17:15.080 --> 00:17:20.520]   I love you mr. Jarvis and thank you for that. That was should I should I play? Oh, thank you
[00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:24.600]   I was afraid you're gonna say I love you, but yeah, that's what I thought was coming
[00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:27.160]   I'm here. Let me let me play
[00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:30.280]   Specifically what I say here in the house everybody else, but no
[00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:34.520]   The bbc is not gonna take a stat if I play it right jeff
[00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:37.720]   No, not at all. Not at all. It's on twitter net is broad
[00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:42.040]   Prove up many places to go, but let's be clear that free speech doesn't only include the right to speak
[00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:44.840]   It includes the right to choose what you carry
[00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:48.520]   To have uh compelled the speech is not free speech
[00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:53.400]   So the platforms are perfectly within the rights to choose to carry Donald trump or not
[00:17:53.400 --> 00:18:00.040]   But isn't the problem when the platforms become so big they're almost like public utilities. They just happen to be run by corporation
[00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:01.000]   Yeah
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:06.280]   The platforms have opened up speech in ways that our old business of mass media never allowed
[00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:10.600]   In this country we have mass media controlled by old white men who look like me
[00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:17.480]   And now the social media allowed black lives matter to come out and me too to come out and all kinds of movements
[00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:19.720]   And yes, it also enables
[00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:25.880]   um the miscreants of of the congressional riot to come out as well, but that's the nature of free speech
[00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:32.280]   But isn't the problem here that you end up with the people in charge of tech companies who largely are driven by
[00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:37.240]   The considerations of profits making decisions about whose speech is acceptable and whose speech isn't
[00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:41.720]   Well, why they are damned if they do and damned if they don't because for the past four years
[00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:46.440]   I've heard people screaming to take down Donald trump to take down disinformation
[00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:51.240]   To fact check to the net and then when they do they get accused of being too big
[00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:55.800]   They just can't win but the reality is though jeff that they may have taken president trump down
[00:18:55.800 --> 00:19:02.600]   They may have currently had disabled parlor but you and I both know if we spent some time on twitter or on instagram or on facebook
[00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:06.360]   Or any of these platforms we'd soon enough find people doing much the same thing
[00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:11.560]   Even if we took down every bit of racist speech we could find and played whack-a-mole with at all
[00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:15.320]   The fundamental problem remains that america is a racist country
[00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:19.880]   So so worrying about this moral panic of technology and social media
[00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:23.320]   Distracts us from the real problem that we have in this nation
[00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:29.640]   But surely you're not saying and of course racism did predate these big tech giants, but surely you're saying their products
[00:19:29.640 --> 00:19:36.760]   Have not affected it at all surely you're not arguing that the internet hasn't in some way changed the dynamic of racism with them
[00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:42.520]   Within american society. I am saving on the balance. It has brought a huge improvement
[00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:50.760]   Black lives matter and the stories that occurred in the hashtag living while black never came out in big old white mass media because it didn't happen to them
[00:19:50.760 --> 00:19:54.600]   Because the newsrooms were not diverse a cause that you care about deeply
[00:19:54.600 --> 00:20:01.880]   Now finally social media enabled people who did not have a voice in mass media to have their voice their press
[00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:08.840]   And so I strongly believe that we've got to leave this open so in general i'm in favor of free speech and of leaving them on there
[00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:10.840]   But i'm also in favor of the platforms
[00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:15.960]   Deciding what norms they should maintain they have a right to do that as well
[00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:23.320]   I think in the net that the net has improved our society the problem right now is that media are in the midst of a moral panic
[00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:25.560]   Trying to attack. Oh you gotta get me
[00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:29.560]   All of our problems distracting us from our real problems
[00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:33.800]   But hold on jeff we've seen already accounts of people
[00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:38.360]   Outside the capital building some of them going inside it and we just forget it
[00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:45.480]   Randomization at the center of their radicalization every single time is these platforms
[00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:48.920]   I love the woman who was shocked in the capital
[00:20:48.920 --> 00:20:54.360]   Her saga according to the stories about her started not with social media to end up there
[00:20:54.360 --> 00:20:56.200]   But started with fox news
[00:20:56.200 --> 00:21:03.720]   Let me be very clear that the single most malign influence in all of english-speaking democracy in my country and yours is rupert
[00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:10.040]   Murdock and fox news. That's where the jury begins journey begins not in social media, but in media
[00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:12.680]   Jeff, thank you very much for coming on outside source
[00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:20.520]   We appreciate it and needless to say rupert murdock would not agree with that categorization of himself or the products which he um
[00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:27.000]   Is this well the bbc is not owned by rupert so I guess it's safe to say that not yeah that Ross is great
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   That's Ross Atkins. Yeah, he's very very good
[00:21:29.400 --> 00:21:35.560]   Um, he started a movement within the bbc to call the 5050 which is to to get more diversity and their sourcing
[00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:39.240]   Starting with gender in the uk but also now we're part of that
[00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:41.800]   Good. Good. He's very good
[00:21:41.800 --> 00:21:43.800]   Thanks for playing the scenario
[00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:50.280]   Listen what listening to that and watching that reminded me of a scenario that I had with a family member back east that wanted to
[00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:53.240]   Message me with something pretty salacious
[00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:57.480]   This was last year sometime before all of this mess started happening
[00:21:58.040 --> 00:22:01.880]   and it and they were all freaked out and and was just trying to
[00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:07.720]   Give me the business about it and all and I said, okay. Well, where did you hear about this? And they told me
[00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:14.680]   Um told me fox news and I said, okay, fine. That's fox news. Do you hear about this on any other platform?
[00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:21.960]   And they said no, I said, so why are you just going to assume that is the gospel is fox news the one and all the
[00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:29.480]   New sources out there. Why aren't you thinking critically about this stuff instead of instead of going out and inciting more?
[00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:35.480]   Idiacy and people getting upset over something that doesn't even really exist or even matter
[00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:39.880]   You know and just the way you hit that right there that just struck home with me mr
[00:22:39.880 --> 00:22:43.800]   Jarvis and they're saying I you were a good guy to move to california
[00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:49.160]   So jeff one of the respite and I'll include all of you in this
[00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:55.160]   Please not just jeff but one of the things that that was kind of interesting was annular annular mirckel of germany
[00:22:55.160 --> 00:23:01.640]   And then followed by uh, manuel micron of france who said well was baffled said well, this should be a government
[00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:07.880]   Regulation not not private industries. They shouldn't be deciding who to platform a deep platform
[00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:12.840]   That's for does that's that's just a fair point. Let's try to face. I think it's a fair point
[00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:15.560]   But it's not what we they don't have a first amendment we do
[00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:23.240]   There's government here is specifically prohibited from making that kind of law then I had a journalist from London call me this morning and
[00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:30.600]   She's doing a public she's doing a story about iran and now iranian activists are saying okay twitter
[00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:35.320]   You took down trump komeny is back or worse for these reasons
[00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:39.320]   Why don't you take him down or why don't you go to the philippines and duterate good question
[00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:45.960]   So they're they're constantly stuck when they set a precedent. Uh-oh now we got to enforce it across even just force enforcing across world
[00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:48.760]   Leaders as hard and by the way, I should say
[00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:53.000]   There's two different
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:58.040]   Interpretations of what these big tech companies have done denny's howl was a lawyer?
[00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:00.040]   and
[00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:05.080]   You know very smart on this stuff said they did it because their lawyers came to them and said you are exposed
[00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:09.000]   You you are in trouble if you let this continue you've got to stop it
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.720]   Uh others have said well what way?
[00:24:11.720 --> 00:24:14.840]   Because protected by section 230
[00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:17.320]   Well, yeah, there's by 230 okay
[00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:23.880]   Yeah, that so some have said well that just gave them the cover to do what they've been wanting to do
[00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:25.720]   um
[00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:26.760]   true
[00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:34.200]   I so I have a third section 230 how far does section 230 go if you know if if if somebody is
[00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:41.320]   Posting plans let's this is a hypothetical if it's illegal. It doesn't save you from illegality right?
[00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:46.280]   No, so it does save a lot of the stuff that was on these things could be interpreted
[00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:47.480]   And and there's some you know
[00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:54.120]   I mean there's a definitely a range of interpretation of what the president said with is that illegal is it legal is he calling for?
[00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:58.360]   Violence or is he just saying you know we got a fight for ideals? I mean
[00:24:58.360 --> 00:25:01.240]   That was a gray area because he's very careful
[00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:07.000]   He's very smart about not as most trolls are about not crossing the boundary into illegality
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   I'm so good for some emmett law
[00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:16.840]   If you look at first memilla, you have to be very very specific about the violence you're calling for and who specifically
[00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:24.440]   You're calling for violence against it's it cases have established that you can't it's not illegal to just say
[00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:28.680]   I think people like this should be harmed. It has to be
[00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:31.800]   Tangible specific and imminent
[00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:36.600]   Okay, and aunt you were saying
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:43.960]   No, I was saying i'm glad you you mentioned that that he was quite selective on how he put his message out
[00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:45.720]   to his
[00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:48.600]   Yeah, he's not gonna say followers go on guys blow it up
[00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:54.840]   It'd be a shame to see what's happening to that nice Congress. Yeah, like like uh, some have said like a mob boss
[00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:59.800]   He doesn't oh, yeah, this way Michael kono said he doesn't have to be explicit. He just we know what he wants
[00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:01.880]   Exactly
[00:26:01.880 --> 00:26:03.720]   exactly
[00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:09.720]   Um, so this idea the government should set it just surprised the heck out of me from miracle and macrol
[00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:12.120]   Um, but they don't have a first amendment
[00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:17.160]   I know even so even so even have an official speech to have compelled speech to have government
[00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:22.680]   demanded speech the government should decide the government button in in this platform the president in germany
[00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:27.160]   President restricts your speech all the time. Yeah, the president for that is you can't post restriction
[00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:32.120]   You can't sell that's the memorabilia on ebay. You can't yeah, but this is compelled speech
[00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:34.280]   This is a new carry
[00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:35.880]   Rorkel
[00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:41.560]   You cannot take miracle. Is that what she was to say? Yeah, that's what she said. It doesn't you can't take you can't take trumped down
[00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:44.360]   Well, I think there's something to be I do think that that's not an on
[00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:49.480]   I know it's gonna make you ballistic, but I think it's not an unreasonable argument that it does give
[00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:52.600]   uh jack dorsey and mark succerberg
[00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:53.880]   uh
[00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:59.000]   Unelected a lot of power unelected capitalists not a lot of power. It's scary trump was an
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.480]   Trump was elected
[00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:09.800]   duly elected official of the united states government. Oh, I I think that that's a reasonable question mark should private companies
[00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:12.680]   be uh unelected
[00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:16.680]   You know all the darks be allowed to do that. Would you say this to the new york times?
[00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:20.520]   You must carry all of trump speeches. You must print them all. That's the equivalent
[00:27:20.520 --> 00:27:24.840]   Of course you wouldn't would you say to nbc wait a minute?
[00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:29.880]   No stop. Hold on. Hold on. There's a must carry on tv. Those are those are platforms
[00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:32.280]   Those are publishers
[00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:34.280]   twitter is not a publisher
[00:27:34.280 --> 00:27:36.280]   That's not the same it's apples and oranges
[00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:39.080]   uh, would you tell uh
[00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:40.120]   Verizon
[00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:42.440]   That they must run the the president's channel
[00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:45.160]   No, you wouldn't we wouldn't do that in this country
[00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:47.720]   But they have to let him make a phone call
[00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:51.800]   Yes
[00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:55.560]   Look, I don't know what the answer is, but I think it's not an unreasonable position to say
[00:27:56.520 --> 00:28:01.000]   Should these big tech companies be in this position? I don't like that either
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:09.720]   How is it any better like I agree government control the speech is bad, but how is it any better to have a bunch of you know 30 some things
[00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:14.680]   Running this gigantic company controlling what people say. How is that any better?
[00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:21.000]   Well, and the other side of it is he's still the president. He could go down any moment to the briefing room
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.480]   Yeah, he could he I mean
[00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:26.360]   It's not like he doesn't still have his bully pulpit
[00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:26.840]   Right
[00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:30.920]   It's not like a talk radio isn't dominated by conservative voices
[00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:36.600]   Do you find it troubling that one of the biggest broadcasters in america cumulus told its hosts?
[00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:41.560]   You may not say this election was stolen. You've got it and by the way, they're they own the shop
[00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:46.680]   Yeah, I mean I've been told if they came and said you may not call grown women girls
[00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:51.320]   That'd be right say well, that's because they're worried about their business and they want to make sure that it uh
[00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:56.040]   Doesn't offend half the audience and yeah, that's what they're right to do is their company. Yeah. Yeah
[00:28:56.040 --> 00:29:03.160]   I have a theory a friend shared with me about what the platforms are doing
[00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:07.160]   This is kind of a conspiracy theory, but and there's no real evidence
[00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:13.720]   But his argument was what if what if they wanted to make um, what if they wanted to
[00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:16.200]   imply an argument about
[00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:19.720]   Fiddling with section 230 if they wanted to say
[00:29:20.760 --> 00:29:23.320]   Fiddling the section 230 is bad getting rid of it is bad
[00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:28.760]   Um, they could just say look without section 230. We would have to do what we're doing now all the time
[00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:35.320]   We have to take everybody down if they said anything even remotely bad because we'd be liable for
[00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:37.880]   Why do you think trump doesn't like 230?
[00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:41.560]   Right
[00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:43.880]   Exactly
[00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:46.680]   You're just no I just got a bad you I think sunday
[00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:54.040]   Thumb the quick panelist we did this right in. Yeah, that was that was probably the most succinct and and
[00:29:54.040 --> 00:30:00.040]   Um, useful discussion about 230 because there's still a lot of people that are confused about far as
[00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:07.080]   What exactly it means to them as a regular user of all of these different platforms? There's congresspeople who are confused
[00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:10.280]   Most people are confused. No
[00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:15.960]   Yeah, so today's sunday, pro sunday, perch i was interviewed on Reuters. Let me see if i can find this real quick
[00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:19.240]   I quoted him. Uh, Reuters has had their kind of undovos
[00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:27.960]   Since there is no Davos is here Reuters. No, that's right four. You know four days online and sundar was interviewed at the end of today
[00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:30.600]   And he said it is the most um
[00:30:30.600 --> 00:30:33.800]   It is the thing about which most people get get it wrong
[00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:37.800]   Um, and mike maznick was very happy that sundar finally started standing up
[00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:44.440]   Four 230 here it is. I've never seen anything that is so foundational that is so misunderstood
[00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:49.400]   Yeah, section 230 is what promotes freedom of expression to which mike baznick said finally
[00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:53.560]   I've been waiting for any of the tech execs to say this, but it's felt like they've been too afraid
[00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:57.400]   Sundar is exactly right people attacking 230 are attacking the wrong thing
[00:30:57.400 --> 00:31:03.720]   Um, people on the left they think attacking 230 means attacking big tech companies on the right
[00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:07.160]   They think attacking 230 means the sensors are going after me
[00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:09.080]   Um
[00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:12.040]   There was also a great moment here. I have to I have to say
[00:31:12.040 --> 00:31:13.400]   Uh
[00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:17.320]   Pichai said the same thing in his testimony to congress in october
[00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:25.080]   So it is about 230. Yeah, he says it's foundational to the to us leadership in the tech sector good. Good. So it's not the first time he said that
[00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:30.360]   It's not just 230 right the tech platforms are protected by the first amendment to
[00:31:30.360 --> 00:31:33.720]   They can't yeah
[00:31:34.520 --> 00:31:39.560]   And also 30 protect it's protecting against different groups 230 protects them against lawsuits
[00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:42.360]   The first amendment protects them against the government government
[00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:47.560]   And newspapers that have comments and forums are protected by 230 as well the guardians
[00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:52.040]   US operation of east of comment is free is protected by 230
[00:31:52.040 --> 00:32:00.600]   The other one was so so barge retailer green war her her that's the that's the uh, as my representative q and non representative
[00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:04.200]   Malinowski calls them the q and on caucus. Yeah, she's the head of the q and my car guys
[00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:08.440]   So she wore a mask she wore a mask today. That's the good news the bad news is that censored
[00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:15.000]   And she uh as a colleague of mine said nothing says censored like speaking freely into a microphone on the floor of the US house
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:22.760]   Podcast publicly that's the thing that really does crack me up about this the the conservative complaints that they're being deep platform
[00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:24.760]   And so culture there are plenty of
[00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:31.400]   Venues for conservative speech as I said talk radio being first and foremost fox news
[00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:34.920]   And then of course the follow-ons like oan and
[00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:40.120]   Newsmax there's plenty of play. It's plenty of venues for conservative thought. Yeah
[00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:45.880]   Um, and and and they end up in media all the time they get you know q and on I think it's a tiny
[00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:47.880]   um
[00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:53.240]   We don't want to say movement, but it gets amplified by media the conservators can amplify by media plenty
[00:32:53.800 --> 00:32:57.320]   Um, you know what I I my most popular tweet this week was saying
[00:32:57.320 --> 00:33:01.000]   um just by the retweets a cup but was saying that
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:03.080]   um
[00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:08.120]   Remember that donald trump was not a genius at twitter. He was a genius at using twitter to manipulate media
[00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:11.880]   He got his stuff up on media. So media, you know, they have the
[00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:15.480]   GOP has plenty of opportunities media. They have a whole tv network
[00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:19.480]   Um, they're doing fine with their attention. Just fine
[00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:23.320]   I do worry though, and I know you hate it when I bring this up, but I do
[00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:28.200]   And I don't know what the answer is but I do worry that facebook in particular
[00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:32.600]   Is a really great place to radicalize people. I guess youtube as well
[00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:38.200]   Um, I is you're saying there's just nothing to do about it and uh, and the benefits outweigh
[00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:42.040]   No, they should you know, I well two things. I don't think we have sufficient data on that
[00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:46.360]   I don't think how much we know that there has been data on youtube that it isn't as bad as it said
[00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:49.720]   But in any case we don't get the data from the company. So it's hard to know
[00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:53.800]   I don't think the research is conclusive, but let's let's let's let's just say I grant what you
[00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:57.960]   What you just said, even though I don't think the data is there or are there the data aren't there
[00:33:57.960 --> 00:33:59.400]   Um
[00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:01.960]   Is that yes, I think the platform is
[00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:04.200]   Long since
[00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:08.120]   Should have said these are our standards of behavior here. This is our north stars
[00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:12.040]   I've said on the show often and we should take this stuff down. I I absolutely agree with that
[00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:17.240]   I think that that which includes taking trump down, right? They had a right to take trump down
[00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:20.280]   They have a right to decide that this is their garden party
[00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:24.200]   By argument this week was it's not an editorial decision. It's a social decision
[00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:29.960]   If you come leo drunk and obnoxious to my party and you start insulting my friends and I kick you out
[00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:33.240]   That's not an editorial decision. That's a social decision
[00:34:33.240 --> 00:34:38.840]   There's a there's a difference of gradation and how it operates, but there's still decisions and judgments. I think they should make yes
[00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:41.960]   But when they make them they get in trouble with the right
[00:34:41.960 --> 00:34:46.680]   No, and and your point with the bbc that they can't win is is well taken. I mean
[00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:52.600]   Oh, yeah, it feels like nobody's happy no matter what they do that hate speech. You're took down was my speech. Yeah
[00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:54.760]   Yeah
[00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:59.400]   Uh, let's take a little break. Uh because ses is going on and isn't it fascinating
[00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:03.880]   For a little for a little um
[00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:05.960]   Um
[00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:10.360]   Tease here if you go to align 103. I know you hate that's why I say it you can see lance
[00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:16.680]   Uh, a little off leaving ses you'll enjoy this. Okay, but we'll do that after this word from
[00:35:17.320 --> 00:35:18.600]   sponsor
[00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:22.440]   Uh, jeff javis is here. I guess you probably knows that by now. So is
[00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:25.640]   Shut up
[00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:33.480]   commercial he just keeps going on so is it through it hands-on photography? I am and uh from the great white north
[00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:36.280]   above the 49th parallel
[00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:38.040]   Matthew ingram

[00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:07.720]   About you know this new form of media streaming on the internet and things like that
[00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:12.040]   They they had already been it trainers in a traditional classroom
[00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:14.520]   Setting and they said, you know
[00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:18.120]   Wouldn't it be cool to do it training kind of like twit does
[00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:23.240]   Podcasts and it pro tv was born of course they've gone far beyond that
[00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:27.000]   But i'm happy to say they started advertising with us at that point now
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:36.120]   They're there in gainsville, florida with this beautiful studio complex running monday through friday doing incredible content all around it
[00:36:36.200 --> 00:36:38.200]   You know as you probably know
[00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:42.040]   It is a big umbrella that covers a lot of concepts
[00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:43.480]   uh
[00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:46.520]   And it's not just you know people were already in it
[00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:53.640]   Polishing their skills or getting new skills. It's also people who want to get into it who need and that actually is how it really started who
[00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:58.840]   Needed the certifications to prove you had the knowledge to get that first job the a plus of the
[00:36:58.840 --> 00:37:01.800]   security plus of the network plus of the mcs e
[00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:05.720]   It pro tv does all of the above
[00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:09.720]   They do just what you need to get started on the right foot in your it

[00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:32.440]   This is a good month to get started. In fact january is getting started in 19 months
[00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:37.160]   At it pro tv a great time to start a new career in the it industry

[00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:57.080]   I actually thought about getting certs because people were they were asking for yeah, um, it's hard because you can't prove you have the skills
[00:40:57.080 --> 00:41:01.720]   That was the thing you haven't ever had a job. What can you do? What can you do? Do you have this cert?
[00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:08.120]   Do you have that cert and it was really frustrating and I got ready to go to school and get a particular cert
[00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:12.360]   But I looked out. I had a friend that said you know what?
[00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:15.800]   I'll I'll let you try it out in a nice line
[00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:20.120]   So he trusted you because he knew you and that's the you know, if you don't have that connection
[00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:24.840]   Right, um, then the cert is really the only way you can say look I have the skills
[00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:28.600]   Once you've got a job and you have a track record it's a lot easier. Of course, right?
[00:41:28.600 --> 00:41:31.560]   Um, all right
[00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:36.200]   All right. Have we talked enough about free speech the platforms?
[00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:39.720]   Uh, all of that of course not
[00:41:39.720 --> 00:41:47.560]   Uh telegram is taking down neo-nazi channels. That's never by the way. This is so this is another big problem and and I
[00:41:47.560 --> 00:41:52.840]   I'm just giving the other side. You you take these guys down and off
[00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:58.920]   They're like bugs. They crawl back under the rocks, but they're up. You can't find them. You can't find them
[00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:01.000]   There are plenty of places for them to go
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:03.480]   telegrams one discord
[00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:04.600]   Matrix
[00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:09.400]   Gabb their eight-chan, you know when when four-chan went away, they went to eight-chan
[00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:14.360]   Um, a I think there's places beyond eight-chan. It's the internet the nature
[00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:15.320]   16-chan
[00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:20.440]   Yeah, I can't remember but yeah the nature of the internet is it's wack-a-mole. You can't
[00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:27.000]   Successfully block all of this you could so so that's why it's the wrong way to think I think is that we've got to
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:30.520]   But we spent all the more time thinking there's somebody bad on the internet. I can't go to bed
[00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:35.640]   When what we need instead is institutions and structures to emphasize and amplify the good
[00:42:35.640 --> 00:42:36.920]   Yeah
[00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:41.880]   And and the baddest idiots are always going to be there. It's like I always say twitter is not the New York Times
[00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:45.160]   It's Times Square. There's always an idiot on what it was. Just like Times Square
[00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:48.680]   I will go to a 110th street and go around
[00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:53.800]   To avoid twitter. I did I just I've had I really have had enough
[00:42:53.800 --> 00:43:00.200]   I just I'm off of it because it makes you're missing so much. No, I'm not I'm missing the
[00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:03.160]   Spilcus that the the
[00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:05.160]   I don't see any Spilcus
[00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:11.880]   I totally get where he's coming from because I feel the same way about my Facebook experience from years ago
[00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:16.120]   Yeah, I got on this Facebook nothing out of it. Yeah, and everything
[00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:22.680]   I thought twice about it yet. I have a friend a dear friend of mine who just recently retired
[00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:28.600]   Who made his business off of Facebook traffic? I mean he did oh I agree 100%
[00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:33.880]   I agree 100% whatever works for you, you know, I'm not look. I'm not saying these
[00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:40.120]   I'm not disagreeing with anybody who says there's value in these platforms. I just don't want to be there
[00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:46.200]   Ethan's ockerman wrote something about what you're describing Leo about how driving
[00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:50.760]   You know whether it's the daily storm or whoever off platforms
[00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:54.040]   They will find places to try some under doing yeah
[00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:58.440]   And they will be harder to find and they will be harder to see and harder to track
[00:43:58.840 --> 00:44:03.000]   But they'll still be doing all the same things. So I guess what you're saying jeff is
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:06.840]   It is point is not to make them invisible
[00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:13.000]   The point is to create a safer better twitter a better face. We need we need we well so so
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:17.800]   the first known effort watch out here comes a Gutenberg moment to
[00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:23.080]   censor the press came in 1470 from Niccolo Paretti
[00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:25.720]   Who was a gromarian?
[00:44:25.720 --> 00:44:31.160]   Who was appalled by a translation of Pliny's work and wrote a letter this one don't worry
[00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:34.520]   I'm gonna get there soon wrote a letter to the pope saying you must stop this
[00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:37.480]   You must appoint someone to censor the press
[00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:41.720]   You must appoint someone to correct all the forms before they go to press because we just can't allow this
[00:44:41.720 --> 00:44:45.640]   Well in a way, he wasn't asking for censorship. He was asking for an editor
[00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:53.320]   And and it took a while took a long time before we invented the institutions of the editor and the publishing house
[00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:57.480]   to find the best and establish quality and
[00:44:57.480 --> 00:45:00.120]   And establish standards
[00:45:00.120 --> 00:45:03.880]   Right it took a while but we invented those institutions to create those standards
[00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:09.880]   We enter a new world where now everybody could speak and you know how much I celebrate that because we have black lives matter and black
[00:45:09.880 --> 00:45:13.160]   living while black and me too and so and occupy wall street and
[00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:15.480]   movements that weren't been heard before
[00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:22.520]   But we also hear queued on an idiocy and right now what's happening is we're concentrating only on the bad stuff and in doing so
[00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:25.080]   We're amplifying the bad guys and ignoring all the good stuff
[00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:30.360]   My difference with you leo is primarily I spend a lot of time on twitter
[00:45:30.360 --> 00:45:31.480]   I follow
[00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:38.040]   306 3,693 people I honestly honestly honestly see no cesspool these stuff
[00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:44.280]   I get no sewer gas from my twitter feed. It is helpful informative amusing friendly
[00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:48.360]   It is a good part of my life. Well, I could say it's so I don't have a new job
[00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:51.480]   Would you please start messing with the thanks a lot Jeff's
[00:45:51.880 --> 00:45:53.880]   You're not doing your job
[00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:57.160]   Most of screenshots and
[00:45:57.160 --> 00:46:03.080]   Jeff, I want to point out you didn't always feel that way remember there was a guy called professor Jeff Jarvis
[00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:08.120]   I hated him and I and I blocked them and yeah, there are bad people there. Yes. What did I do? I ignored him
[00:46:08.120 --> 00:46:11.480]   And he's he's under a rock somewhere and I don't give a damn
[00:46:11.480 --> 00:46:17.400]   My experience started out for you blot of shaky as well on twitter and and I didn't quite
[00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:24.200]   Think it mattered or had any kind of point but it took a while to do a bit of curation and working on it
[00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:29.400]   And now I I love being there you guys talk like junkies. You're just like junkies. You're saying
[00:46:29.400 --> 00:46:34.200]   Yeah, man. You're gonna really miss it when I when you're gone, man. It's great
[00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:40.600]   So all you're gonna be left with that is we can join saying that you can take a tour from me. All right
[00:46:40.600 --> 00:46:46.760]   I do not miss either twitter or facebook. I have a much better point without a weekend time
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:54.280]   Yeah, right. See that's that's the role we had before let tie magazine. Tell you about the entire world. No, I'm really glad I'm rid of that
[00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:56.840]   I did want to mention though that
[00:46:56.840 --> 00:47:03.080]   Taking parlor off of a ws is I think significantly different than removing someone from twitter discussion
[00:47:03.080 --> 00:47:08.840]   So so banthew talking about that. So is it was it was it aligned too far? Is was it too infrastructural or not?
[00:47:08.840 --> 00:47:13.000]   So I think I mean I don't know but I think it raised
[00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:21.160]   Because this is a very similar down to the stack the challenges that matthew prince at cloud flare
[00:47:21.160 --> 00:47:25.480]   Exactly because he was protecting d-doss
[00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:30.920]   Protection for the daily stormer. Is that up the stack or down the stand 8-chan and 8-chan?
[00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:36.200]   I don't know is it up or down? I think it's down. Matthew was very much matthew was very much
[00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:39.480]   saying well, we got to protect speech and
[00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:45.720]   Honestly, it's not for us to deplatform somebody he did eventually by the way
[00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:52.040]   It's a very different what he wrote. It's worth reading what he wrote after the daily stormer
[00:47:52.040 --> 00:47:54.040]   And he mentioned what they did with 8-chan as well
[00:47:54.040 --> 00:47:59.720]   And he said I feel uncomfortable being in this position. I should not be
[00:47:59.720 --> 00:48:04.920]   Do like I should not be in a position where I can do this remove someone effectively
[00:48:05.320 --> 00:48:09.880]   From the internet and yes, you can as a number of people point out to me you can run your own
[00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:15.240]   Server on a raspberry pie in your mom's basement or whatever and you will technically be on the internet
[00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:20.200]   But it's it's still it's qualitatively different to have
[00:48:20.200 --> 00:48:26.520]   Something like a a ws or cloud flare remove you then it is for twitter to remove you daily stormer
[00:48:26.520 --> 00:48:28.600]   We should mention was a nazi
[00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:31.560]   newspaper a white supremacist doesn't the weather thing
[00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:36.120]   um
[00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:41.640]   And by the way, I think that's where Denise house point comes in. I think amazon even
[00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:45.320]   So even if they weren't exposed by hosting parlor
[00:48:45.320 --> 00:48:50.600]   Because there was definitely illegal content on parlor. There's no question about that. We've seen some of it
[00:48:50.600 --> 00:48:58.120]   I mean people in saying you should have amazon the vice president the court was there's some bad stuff there
[00:48:58.120 --> 00:49:03.720]   Sure, so whether they were using it as a pretext for doing something they wanted or their lawyers said
[00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:06.280]   You really need to do this because you're exposed
[00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:08.840]   Uh, is a my remember
[00:49:08.840 --> 00:49:12.600]   But I remember when they took down wickily because as well
[00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:15.720]   Right as they were effectively threatened by the by congress
[00:49:15.720 --> 00:49:19.880]   Right and so i was to use that storm at the time. Right. Yeah, is that good?
[00:49:19.880 --> 00:49:25.160]   I mean, I was not happy about that when it's when it's someone we don't like so but it
[00:49:25.160 --> 00:49:29.640]   Is it best thing the best way to handle this case by case
[00:49:29.640 --> 00:49:31.560]   uh
[00:49:31.560 --> 00:49:36.680]   Is it impossible to make a policy and say well this should that's what they hate they hate that because they want to rule
[00:49:36.680 --> 00:49:41.480]   They can plug into an algorithm or plug into a rule set that says see we did this
[00:49:41.480 --> 00:49:43.960]   And and so my argument to them is
[00:49:43.960 --> 00:49:47.880]   You're you're thinking of the statutory level. You should be thinking at a constitutional level
[00:49:47.880 --> 00:49:53.960]   On on a level of principles and then yes, it's case by case, but you have something to call upon all they have to call upon now
[00:49:53.960 --> 00:49:56.120]   Facebook is the statute of the breast
[00:49:56.840 --> 00:50:01.400]   Female breast with nipple not allowed a less baby or surgery or statue
[00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:07.080]   Right and they're at that level rather than yeah, they want something out rhythmic. Yeah, and it's not algorithmic
[00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:10.920]   No, no, I like to know why yeah, why did twitter
[00:50:10.920 --> 00:50:15.800]   Why was what trump said at the rally in which he didn't mention violence at all?
[00:50:15.800 --> 00:50:23.240]   Why was that different compared to when he said when the looting starts the shooting starts?
[00:50:23.240 --> 00:50:25.240]   Yep
[00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:30.680]   That was that was advocating violence pretty clearly. Yeah. Yeah, it was uh, it's also timing
[00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:34.680]   It's it's you know, you you look at at the the
[00:50:34.680 --> 00:50:39.480]   I think one thing we we forget about is we people well twitter should be braver. Well
[00:50:39.480 --> 00:50:44.600]   Donald trump had a corrupt department of justice jail the irs
[00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:50.440]   Um a bob all behind him and it wasn't until the end of his reign
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:56.200]   That I think that they have the courage france me to do this and we can mock them for that
[00:50:56.200 --> 00:50:59.720]   But hell the republican members would harvest and wouldn't vote
[00:50:59.720 --> 00:51:04.120]   The other way because they were afraid for the physical safety of their families
[00:51:04.120 --> 00:51:08.360]   I think we should mock them a little bit because it's fine to
[00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:13.320]   I think it was a alexander petri or petri dishes on twitter who wrote
[00:51:13.320 --> 00:51:16.760]   You know, i'm resigning from the death star
[00:51:16.760 --> 00:51:22.280]   Um because I can't put up with this anymore a week before it blows up
[00:51:22.280 --> 00:51:25.800]   Yeah, it's it's it's a little easy for us to say. I'm saying
[00:51:25.800 --> 00:51:30.600]   It's super easy mike maznick had a great post last friday, uh on his
[00:51:30.600 --> 00:51:37.320]   Sock tech dirt not easy not unreasonable, but not censorship the decision to bend trump from twitter
[00:51:37.320 --> 00:51:40.920]   And in which he's basically saying
[00:51:40.920 --> 00:51:44.200]   It is it is ad hoc
[00:51:44.760 --> 00:51:51.400]   It it isn't there aren't algorithms and at each point, uh, the decision has to be made
[00:51:51.400 --> 00:52:00.200]   To those who think the twitter should have done this earlier he writes or that it would have made a difference
[00:52:00.200 --> 00:52:04.360]   Remember recognize your concern is not so much with twitter, but with trump himself
[00:52:04.360 --> 00:52:08.200]   Remember that while trump might not be able to send a tweet right now
[00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:12.680]   He still literally has the power to launch nuclear missiles at twitter's headquarters. I don't think he does
[00:52:12.760 --> 00:52:14.760]   I think he can only target
[00:52:14.760 --> 00:52:17.400]   Enemy installations, but I might be wrong
[00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:20.520]   Um trump is obviously too toxic for twitter
[00:52:20.520 --> 00:52:25.400]   But he's also too toxic for the white house the real complaint shouldn't be about twitter or facebook acting too late
[00:52:25.400 --> 00:52:27.400]   But about congress failing to do their job
[00:52:27.400 --> 00:52:30.680]   And removing the madman from power and by the way as we'd speak
[00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:36.600]   Congress has voted to implose you speaking right now the second time speaking of twitter
[00:52:36.600 --> 00:52:39.560]   There was a great thread from the guy who looked into
[00:52:40.760 --> 00:52:44.040]   Trump's what it would take for trump to actually launch a nuclear missile
[00:52:44.040 --> 00:52:49.480]   And you're right that technically he has to call a play from the playbook. Yeah, he has a
[00:52:49.480 --> 00:52:52.120]   targets
[00:52:52.120 --> 00:52:54.120]   Mona's house. No, no
[00:52:54.120 --> 00:52:57.240]   Uh, which is still not reassuring
[00:52:57.240 --> 00:53:03.800]   The goodness is most of those targets are in the old russia old soviet union so and I know he doesn't want to do that because you know
[00:53:03.800 --> 00:53:08.600]   First he has to call the right phone allegedly and which is held by his aid
[00:53:08.680 --> 00:53:10.680]   So if the aid doesn't give him the phone number
[00:53:10.680 --> 00:53:14.920]   You know, there was a proposal once and I think it was brilliant
[00:53:14.920 --> 00:53:18.840]   It's horrific, but it was brilliant that the phone number should be
[00:53:18.840 --> 00:53:23.000]   surgically placed in the aids chest
[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:31.880]   And that the president should have a knife break glass to use knife lore and be compelled to kill the aid to use that phone number
[00:53:31.880 --> 00:53:35.480]   But there's a good reason for this so that oh yeah
[00:53:35.960 --> 00:53:41.880]   Million deaths he will be causing which in abstract are brought to concrete reality
[00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:46.120]   You got to kill one person yourself before you're allowed to kill a million
[00:53:46.120 --> 00:53:49.720]   So I heard the aids voted that down. They didn't want that one now
[00:53:49.720 --> 00:53:56.760]   It's too horrific to even mention but it's you know, it's an interesting thought experiment because
[00:53:56.760 --> 00:53:59.800]   If you're not willing to kill the person standing in front of you
[00:53:59.800 --> 00:54:03.000]   Should you be allowed to kill the million people who are not?
[00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:10.840]   That is the amplified version of count to 30 before you send that out to 30
[00:54:10.840 --> 00:54:14.840]   That's another way to do it. Yeah
[00:54:14.840 --> 00:54:20.200]   You know that we live in such challenging
[00:54:20.200 --> 00:54:23.960]   Time yes, I was going to ask you whether you read
[00:54:23.960 --> 00:54:26.840]   Something Emily bell wrote for the financial times
[00:54:26.840 --> 00:54:32.840]   Where she said we we need a more eu approach to speech. Oh, of course you were done
[00:54:33.560 --> 00:54:35.560]   She's so British
[00:54:35.560 --> 00:54:40.200]   This is am I just where amylie. I love emily, but we go back and forth all the time Emily Emily is
[00:54:40.200 --> 00:54:43.880]   believes that there's no the capitalism and journalism are fundamentally incompatible
[00:54:43.880 --> 00:54:49.480]   We have to get rid of capitalism and journalism and the government regulation and government creation is the solution to most everything
[00:54:49.480 --> 00:54:52.040]   So you guess emily and I don't always agree
[00:54:52.040 --> 00:55:01.880]   I don't know. I mean we are we not putting a lot of really an awful lot of power in these platforms hands and we are
[00:55:02.120 --> 00:55:08.680]   Sure, we had a couple of a couple of white guys mark succuburg jack dorsey again. I have two words in response
[00:55:08.680 --> 00:55:11.160]   Donald trump
[00:55:11.160 --> 00:55:17.960]   So for the last but he was elected we're better off. We were better off in their hands. Yes, he was duly elected by a democratic process
[00:55:17.960 --> 00:55:21.720]   You may not like him. I may not like him, but he was not elected. Yeah
[00:55:21.720 --> 00:55:28.840]   Trump won a presidential election he later lost but he won a presidential election and and and and under the law of
[00:55:29.160 --> 00:55:31.960]   I'm sorry. I'm gonna go godwin here under the law of Germany
[00:55:31.960 --> 00:55:34.760]   Hitler
[00:55:34.760 --> 00:55:36.440]   Was legally ensconced, right?
[00:55:36.440 --> 00:55:39.800]   But at some point you say someone is bad in office and wrong in office
[00:55:39.800 --> 00:55:47.480]   And you need to check and my point is the public including journalism is a check on that power and so so we know I
[00:55:47.480 --> 00:55:50.600]   And there's
[00:55:50.600 --> 00:55:55.000]   There's a process for getting rid of trump. There's no process for arguing with mark succuburg
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:57.320]   There's no appeal. There's no helpline
[00:55:57.640 --> 00:56:01.400]   They will get you why did he why did he bother getting rid of trump because of public pressure on him
[00:56:01.400 --> 00:56:05.160]   There was a process it worked
[00:56:05.160 --> 00:56:06.840]   for a while but so
[00:56:06.840 --> 00:56:13.880]   Was it up to the crepe iron works having dinner and lunches with with the white house just a hand in a month ago?
[00:56:13.880 --> 00:56:18.520]   Um, so I don't well I repeat well then then all these him bring leo's words back then aunt
[00:56:18.520 --> 00:56:21.480]   He's the president of the united states. Why wouldn't you have dinner with the president of the united states?
[00:56:23.320 --> 00:56:27.480]   If you're I if you're a good CEO you have to that's your job your job is not
[00:56:27.480 --> 00:56:31.080]   To weigh in on you know your company your
[00:56:31.080 --> 00:56:36.360]   With you but you don't have to hire somebody like joe caplin who basically
[00:56:36.360 --> 00:56:41.160]   You're not to cater to conservative so should the
[00:56:41.160 --> 00:56:48.680]   Crop family the big munitions family in germany should they have said to aid off hitler look
[00:56:49.320 --> 00:56:53.960]   You got elected you're the chancellor, but we're not gonna we're not gonna work on a deep platform
[00:56:53.960 --> 00:56:58.520]   Somebody should have but they did yeah, yeah, they didn't and so you need you need independent checks
[00:56:58.520 --> 00:57:00.600]   This is why we have independent institutions
[00:57:00.600 --> 00:57:05.960]   I'm I know these moments. I sound like i'm libertarian anti-government
[00:57:05.960 --> 00:57:11.480]   I am not I am pro government and pro safety didn't pro lots of things, but i'm also pro public
[00:57:11.480 --> 00:57:14.200]   um counterweight
[00:57:14.200 --> 00:57:16.200]   Right. We're all in it together
[00:57:18.840 --> 00:57:23.400]   All right, so I have a friend of mine a friend of mine from south america right now who is who's email me just appalled
[00:57:23.400 --> 00:57:26.840]   At these images of american soldiers in full regalia
[00:57:26.840 --> 00:57:33.400]   Sleeping in the capital that's it that that but but you and i she comes from our relief. No, it's
[00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:39.240]   But you and i are saying oh thank god because they weren't there on wednesday
[00:57:39.240 --> 00:57:43.240]   and she's saying wtf well
[00:57:43.240 --> 00:57:46.040]   What are you guys talking about?
[00:57:46.040 --> 00:57:48.040]   Respective is everyone
[00:57:48.520 --> 00:57:53.240]   They're lying on the floor in a room and there's a plaque and someone i'm not sure if this is true
[00:57:53.240 --> 00:57:55.320]   But they said that plaque commemorates
[00:57:55.320 --> 00:58:00.360]   When us soldiers billoted in the capital during the civil war
[00:58:00.360 --> 00:58:03.480]   Wow
[00:58:03.480 --> 00:58:05.640]   Well, nancy polosi has her electron back
[00:58:05.640 --> 00:58:12.120]   But oh, so that's a you know that was wondering that that guy just carried it completely out or did he just carry it?
[00:58:12.120 --> 00:58:17.800]   No way. They might have done a new one. But they they said it's back. Yeah, okay. He's been arrested as well
[00:58:17.800 --> 00:58:19.800]   Yeah, oh there yeah
[00:58:19.800 --> 00:58:23.880]   I should try to try to check that on on united
[00:58:23.880 --> 00:58:30.280]   Has there been any follow-up on the tech that had been stolen?
[00:58:30.280 --> 00:58:32.920]   Well, this is a
[00:58:32.920 --> 00:58:38.760]   We do not know this is a massive as you know cyber security issue
[00:58:38.760 --> 00:58:46.120]   Because most of the staffers members of congress left their computers logged in they ran out of here. I don't blame them
[00:58:46.840 --> 00:58:48.840]   As he poloses
[00:58:48.840 --> 00:58:52.520]   Yeah, stolen laptop laptop was stolen not several laptops were stolen
[00:58:52.520 --> 00:58:55.800]   But even more of greater concern is the computers that were logged in and on
[00:58:55.800 --> 00:59:02.360]   And again most of these guys are idiots. We're not they weren't gonna do that
[00:59:02.360 --> 00:59:06.280]   But there were I think a handful of people in there who were absolutely
[00:59:06.280 --> 00:59:09.400]   bone-chillingly
[00:59:09.400 --> 00:59:10.840]   uh
[00:59:10.840 --> 00:59:14.360]   You know of mal and tent and who knows who had a usb key
[00:59:14.840 --> 00:59:18.360]   And didn't take that opportunity to go around and put malware on there so malware
[00:59:18.360 --> 00:59:25.400]   It turns out every uh office has its own it system. They're not all networked together. Yeah, I
[00:59:25.400 --> 00:59:31.320]   There's not some central system. So in some ways, that's a good thing. It's both a good thing and a bad thing
[00:59:31.320 --> 00:59:33.320]   It's a good thing because they're not all tied together
[00:59:33.320 --> 00:59:39.480]   It's a bad thing because the practice security practices vary right right and so you know
[00:59:39.480 --> 00:59:41.720]   Uh, it's kind of a mess
[00:59:42.040 --> 00:59:45.240]   Login is it men password as well? Yeah, it's kind of a mess
[00:59:45.240 --> 00:59:50.760]   I I I don't know, you know if if you were
[00:59:50.760 --> 00:59:59.720]   A russian or chinese operative in the united states. I think it would have behooved you to be in that crowd. That's a rare opportunity. Oh
[00:59:59.720 --> 01:00:01.480]   Yeah
[01:00:01.480 --> 01:00:02.520]   So
[01:00:02.520 --> 01:00:04.600]   Uh, you know was fancy bear there
[01:00:04.600 --> 01:00:09.320]   If they if they weren't they really missed a big opportunity and there was plenty of warning
[01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:11.720]   It wasn't like they didn't know
[01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:18.040]   So everybody knew except the capital police. Yeah, well, I think they knew too and uh, but you know, i'm gonna get to conspiracy here
[01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:23.400]   I think I think I think some members of congress are already have been since
[01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:25.880]   You know what we got
[01:00:25.880 --> 01:00:30.840]   Defeated in california last time around and others have been in the pay of the russians
[01:00:30.840 --> 01:00:33.640]   there alisa
[01:00:33.640 --> 01:00:38.200]   Um, you know, yeah, well, I mean rurbach. Yeah, and I said rurbach
[01:00:38.280 --> 01:00:45.560]   Yeah, I says not great either, but rurbach. Yeah, I don't know. I mean it's easy to impute that yeah, who knows? Um, I don't know
[01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:51.560]   I don't know. I said these are all we ever find out the real russian relationships. Will we ever get this? I don't know
[01:00:51.560 --> 01:00:55.640]   I have a theory
[01:00:55.640 --> 01:01:00.200]   What's up? Remember the president wanted to go to scotland on an ocuration day
[01:01:00.200 --> 01:01:03.880]   I think his plan was to go to scotland and from there to muskow
[01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:06.680]   Yeah, to be honest
[01:01:06.680 --> 01:01:11.160]   I'm just wondering does do we have an extradition treaty with russia? I'm asking for a friend
[01:01:11.160 --> 01:01:15.800]   I mean let me call mr. Snowden
[01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:18.920]   Yeah, no he could eat. I mean
[01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:23.880]   That would be a crazy ending if I were writing a novel. That's how I'd end it
[01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:28.840]   Well, the other piece here is the is the financial piece is is dire for him
[01:01:28.840 --> 01:01:30.600]   dire
[01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:33.640]   Well, I you know, I understand why he's perturbed
[01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:37.480]   I'd be a little perturbed too
[01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:45.640]   Um, we shall see we shall see he's not going to scotland by the way. They said under no circumstances. Are you to come here? Lottie?
[01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:48.520]   Stay home
[01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:54.280]   Do you ever get scots were pissed to you every time they look now most of the time they go your scot
[01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:59.480]   Accent is so awful that I have they all say that yeah, they all say that it's awful
[01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:03.240]   I enjoy it
[01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:05.880]   Yeah, every time it gives me the
[01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:07.880]   It gives me the game. It's a
[01:02:07.880 --> 01:02:15.880]   So where you guys are you guys sad you're not a CES? Well, here's lance you an officer a tweet that you were referring to earlier of
[01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:19.640]   You know, he says this wraps up another CES for me. There he is
[01:02:19.640 --> 01:02:22.920]   On the airplane heading for home CES 20
[01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:29.400]   2021 poor lance. That's a long oh wait a minute. He's at home and that's on his screen and he's not
[01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:38.200]   That's like oh, you know, I have to say if if you didn't go to CES this year, which you couldn't obviously it was all online
[01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:40.440]   um
[01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:46.120]   It was actually I think it's somewhat harder because many of the events started for those of us in california 4 30 in the morning
[01:02:46.120 --> 01:02:50.760]   It's don't it's don't miss a little bit you could have did you go? Did you do some stuff?
[01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:57.400]   I've been trying to get into some different events and fortunately you had the likes of show stoppers and pebcom
[01:02:57.800 --> 01:03:02.920]   That made things easier. What was it like? Did they have a fake lobby on the screen that you then yes?
[01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:05.080]   It looked pretty cheesy. I'll
[01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:10.440]   Look pretty cheesy. Hey, welcome to the virtual room and then it takes you to a zoom event
[01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:16.440]   Um and the zoom events were just like any other zoom event we've seen for the last 10 months
[01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:20.520]   And it was just it's just not that seems more painful to me
[01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:25.160]   Yeah, it's just not the same and then the fact that you know, you're having to do it
[01:03:25.800 --> 01:03:32.040]   Virtually so you get all of these invitations to keep up with and as you mentioned the time zone difference
[01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:37.400]   So I'm freaking exhausted and I hadn't even gone to vegas. Yeah, it's teams by the way
[01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:42.200]   They use microsoft teams, but we use lowercase z's teams. That's described
[01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:46.280]   We all know what it is. I
[01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:49.320]   So when this all began a few months
[01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:53.080]   Into it. I was thinking, you know, the world's gonna be different
[01:03:53.080 --> 01:03:56.440]   We might be a little more chastened those trade shows may go away
[01:03:56.440 --> 01:04:01.000]   Travel world travel might go down. I am now of the opinion that
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:06.280]   When the dam breaks probably in the third or fourth quarter of this year
[01:04:06.280 --> 01:04:11.480]   It's gonna break with a vengeance the people have been not spending as much money
[01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:15.960]   So at least those of us who have been able to continue to work will have some cash
[01:04:15.960 --> 01:04:22.040]   Uh, they'll be desperate to travel to party to ces 2022
[01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:26.600]   I'm gonna make a prediction right here. We'll be the first I thought oh, it's gonna go away
[01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:31.160]   Everybody's gonna say we don't need the same work. I have now of the opinion. It will be a back-a-now
[01:04:31.160 --> 01:04:33.240]   It'll be insane
[01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:40.920]   Then the people swinging from the chandeliers. It'll be nuts because just like the roaring 20s in the 1920s
[01:04:40.920 --> 01:04:44.040]   Right, uh, exactly people. I just can't wait
[01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:46.760]   Let me out of here. Let me out of here
[01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:54.680]   You know, I was talking to Alex Lindsay yesterday because he's been on the of the the message of these things just got to go away
[01:04:54.680 --> 01:04:58.520]   There's no point in doing it. Well, he's in the business of producing the virtual
[01:04:58.520 --> 01:05:05.720]   Yeah, so of course and I had to give him a little grief on that because I said look that that's fine for some but
[01:05:05.720 --> 01:05:12.440]   For ces I had I totally disagree because you look at everybody's not an intel everybody's not an lg
[01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:17.720]   They don't have those same types of budgets, but those smaller, you know, small to medium-sized companies
[01:05:17.720 --> 01:05:23.960]   They depend on ces they depend on people coming there very good for them to show the products
[01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:29.640]   Meing part of the press. I need to see some of those products because looking at it on one of these
[01:05:29.640 --> 01:05:36.200]   Stupid virtual meetings is not the same. It's just it was a pain. Huh? Yeah
[01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:38.920]   Did you know the entire this time of year?
[01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:43.560]   But I usually enjoy being tired this time of year because I really enjoy going
[01:05:43.560 --> 01:05:45.480]   I had just working it
[01:05:45.480 --> 01:05:47.800]   I had so much fun with you last year and
[01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:53.480]   And I hadn't been to ces in almost a decade. It was and we worked it was a lot of work
[01:05:53.480 --> 01:05:55.560]   I had a blast
[01:05:55.560 --> 01:06:00.520]   And I will I will be back. I'll wear a mask next time but I will I will yeah
[01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:04.520]   I will be back. Did you have you seen anything at all that you thought was interesting?
[01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:10.360]   Uh, the only thing that really got my interest was what tcl was doing
[01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:17.240]   Uh, we talked about rolling a last year with all of their displays and they do it at a cost-effective way, you know
[01:06:17.240 --> 01:06:19.240]   It's not crazy expensive
[01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:21.640]   um, and then
[01:06:21.640 --> 01:06:24.120]   I want to say I saw owc had a
[01:06:24.120 --> 01:06:29.800]   Travel doc that I liked uh that's usbc connected and it just it's tiny
[01:06:29.800 --> 01:06:35.800]   But it does everything the content creator would need far is getting their ingest done and so forth and you can
[01:06:36.040 --> 01:06:42.600]   Stream with it and it because it's got an ethernet poured on it and yeah, just here's uh, it seemed okay
[01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:46.520]   Now tcl doesn't make these phones lg. I think is uh is also said they're gonna do this
[01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:51.080]   But this is a tcl it's hard to see this but this display grows
[01:06:51.080 --> 01:06:57.400]   Oh, yeah, that's their concept. It's a rolling display and then they had this one which is like an Egyptian scroll
[01:06:57.400 --> 01:07:01.640]   Uh tablet that rolls up and then unrolls like a scroll
[01:07:04.280 --> 01:07:11.800]   You have to hold it open. How do you use it? I know it's uh, it's a concept. That's why I don't like concept stuff
[01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:12.600]   Yeah
[01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:14.600]   Well, but some of it's real lg's
[01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:17.320]   For years at least two
[01:07:17.320 --> 01:07:23.320]   At ces lg showed a tv for people who didn't want to admit they watched tv that was like in a box
[01:07:23.320 --> 01:07:25.720]   And then you press the button and it rolls up
[01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:27.640]   Yeah
[01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:29.880]   It's now available for $86,000
[01:07:29.880 --> 01:07:32.440]   For more
[01:07:32.440 --> 01:07:38.280]   Seems reasonable. I mean even even the curved display wasn't was lg the first people to do that
[01:07:38.280 --> 01:07:40.120]   I was
[01:07:40.120 --> 01:07:42.680]   I had a samsung group display. I remember
[01:07:42.680 --> 01:07:46.520]   I remember being in the hall and seeing the lg
[01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:52.360]   Big theatrical entrance and everything and and there's a massive that water fall
[01:07:52.360 --> 01:07:57.080]   Yeah, I remember seeing that for the first time that lg and now that's common
[01:07:57.080 --> 01:07:59.480]   You walk over there and it's and it's still there
[01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:05.800]   It's not there now and that's one of the sad things. Yeah, uh, you can't judge a tv by a team's call
[01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:07.400]   No
[01:08:07.400 --> 01:08:10.600]   So here's lg's here's lg's for this is so weird
[01:08:10.600 --> 01:08:15.320]   lg's doesn't expand in the vertical expands in the heart or as all
[01:08:15.320 --> 01:08:17.480]   so
[01:08:17.480 --> 01:08:19.720]   It's just a weird idea
[01:08:19.720 --> 01:08:24.600]   Yeah, at least tcl gave you actual real video
[01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:28.360]   Of their concept in action. Yeah, lg did not
[01:08:28.760 --> 01:08:33.160]   Yeah, um, did I have that it actually may still be in that same cnet article sir
[01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:39.640]   Okay, the tcl version okay tweet from black from brad maulin. I believe this nothing. I just showed it didn't I?
[01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:43.240]   I just showed no you saw the scroll that was the tablet
[01:08:43.240 --> 01:08:50.280]   So I also showed the I showed the phone that goes up and down but it goes up and down in the portrait mode and and lg's went up and down in the
[01:08:50.280 --> 01:08:54.440]   Landscape mode there was there's always the weird stuff like this
[01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:57.560]   the smart lipstick from eve sauma roll
[01:08:58.440 --> 01:09:01.240]   But this actually is interesting because you can change the color
[01:09:01.240 --> 01:09:04.840]   It's like it's it's you can you can add different colors in
[01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:07.240]   Based on your outfit
[01:09:07.240 --> 01:09:10.920]   Yeah, it's called perso. It has three liquid lipstick cartridges
[01:09:10.920 --> 01:09:17.320]   You can mix the colors of the three to any color you like using the included smite brush
[01:09:17.320 --> 01:09:23.080]   How smart is the smart brush wheels just like you try a color printer
[01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:26.600]   Yeah, exactly it's just get ink for it you get ink for your lips
[01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:33.400]   Oh lord, did they um raise raise or had a smart mask go ahead?
[01:09:33.400 --> 01:09:40.440]   I was just gonna I don't know whether to mention this or not, but did they raise the um or mention the
[01:09:40.440 --> 01:09:42.680]   Male chastity device that's a
[01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:48.360]   But we had a lot of fun on security now yesterday
[01:09:48.360 --> 01:09:52.440]   All that talking about it apparently this device which is
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:56.360]   A male chastity device. Yeah, it's a chastity belt basically
[01:09:56.360 --> 01:09:58.280]   Uh
[01:09:58.280 --> 01:10:01.080]   But it's controlled by a smartphone, but apparently it's hackable
[01:10:01.080 --> 01:10:04.920]   Oh joy, so you can get
[01:10:04.920 --> 01:10:06.920]   You can get locked in
[01:10:06.920 --> 01:10:13.160]   Which doesn't seem that's customer lock-in right now. Yeah, that's right. It's the harvey wines time. Uh, hack
[01:10:13.160 --> 01:10:16.920]   Yeah, it would be a shame if you should not be able to
[01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:26.120]   Somebody had uh, this is what's great about twitter somebody had an image of bill gates from like 1980
[01:10:26.120 --> 01:10:32.520]   Something saying in the future you'll be able to do almost anything with your computer and then right next to where they had this story
[01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:40.200]   Uh, they talked to one victim who asked to be uh, this is from I think the uh ap
[01:10:40.200 --> 01:10:43.160]   Who asked to be identified only as robert?
[01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:47.560]   He said he received a message from a hacker demanding payment of 0.02 bitcoin
[01:10:47.560 --> 01:10:50.120]   750 bucks to unlock
[01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:52.520]   the chastity cage
[01:10:52.520 --> 01:10:55.240]   Uh, robert fortunately was not wearing it
[01:10:55.240 --> 01:10:59.560]   Wow
[01:10:59.560 --> 01:11:04.360]   But but he couldn't gain access to it some kid in ukraine apparently
[01:11:04.360 --> 01:11:11.320]   Um, wow, wow is right. I think that's a pretty enterprise Ukraine. There's always a great. Yeah
[01:11:11.320 --> 01:11:19.080]   You mentioned that smart mask from razor in I found that interesting because it seems like i'm
[01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:21.320]   reading and hearing
[01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:27.320]   Some of these public places when you walk up with the mask on they don't want you to have those little aspirators. They
[01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:29.800]   Oh, yeah, you can't it's uh, that's so
[01:11:29.800 --> 01:11:33.560]   That's and they shouldn't because that's uh, not technically
[01:11:33.560 --> 01:11:39.480]   That's all the bad things. I wear it's called a it's called a respirator because you know when you work with sawdust
[01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:43.640]   Uh, you might wear an n95 respirator. They have a valve this has a valve
[01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:48.280]   So when you're breathing in you're protected, but when you're breathing out you're spraying your covet
[01:11:48.520 --> 01:11:56.120]   So I yeah, I wear a mask over the mask so that I'm doubly i'm protecting you, but i'm definitely protecting me here by the way
[01:11:56.120 --> 01:12:05.720]   I actually fatted on amazon is the cellmate the app controlled chastity device. So it comes in different sizes. This is long and black
[01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:08.280]   um
[01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:11.320]   Uh, there's a lot of us wait a minute
[01:12:11.320 --> 01:12:15.320]   Customers who bought this item also bought
[01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:19.400]   the rz y silicone cage
[01:12:19.400 --> 01:12:28.120]   There's a lot of all me but that this is a vast market who knew this says he's not here also the 18 inch writing crop
[01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:32.440]   Uh, don't don't linger on that page. Well, that's up on them. Yeah
[01:12:32.440 --> 01:12:36.680]   Your cookies are already a miss
[01:12:36.680 --> 01:12:43.640]   All i'm gonna get some interesting recommendations. Yeah, I might have to leave my amazon account right now
[01:12:46.520 --> 01:12:50.200]   Who knew this was such a big market. I didn't I had no idea
[01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:55.640]   Good book mark that for later. I am yeah, I'm maybe just order it right now
[01:12:55.640 --> 01:12:58.600]   Ships within three to four days
[01:12:58.600 --> 01:13:03.640]   186 bucks chastity does not come cheap. He saw what's it worth?
[01:13:03.640 --> 01:13:12.840]   Anything else you saw that interested you aunt
[01:13:14.440 --> 01:13:18.200]   I know that was about it. I but what we're talking about tcl
[01:13:18.200 --> 01:13:19.640]   um
[01:13:19.640 --> 01:13:25.080]   Assuming that you'll be able to talk to mr. Scott wokinson this week. I will he's gonna do a whole because of course
[01:13:25.080 --> 01:13:29.720]   He's our home theater guy on the radio show and he will he will I would love to hear his perspective
[01:13:29.720 --> 01:13:33.400]   From seeing this this stuff virtually and right, you know
[01:13:33.400 --> 01:13:37.480]   What did he get out of it because when we hung out with him last year? It was just
[01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:44.200]   Just a wealth of information and I learned a lot more just because he was there and he was able to point things out and
[01:13:44.280 --> 01:13:49.240]   You know again, it's being there, you know versus this virtual stuff that we're doing
[01:13:49.240 --> 01:13:52.760]   I think with tv's you have to see them
[01:13:52.760 --> 01:13:56.200]   Just there's nothing there's no point even
[01:13:56.200 --> 01:13:59.320]   If you don't see him, you don't see it. I mean it's crazy
[01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:02.280]   If we don't do ces
[01:14:02.280 --> 01:14:07.080]   In person let's do it next year. Let's make a plan right now
[01:14:07.080 --> 01:14:12.280]   Oh, no, I'm saying if ces happens to to just go to this full virtual
[01:14:13.240 --> 01:14:19.720]   Version of it going forward. Would it be better off if they were to spread it out and not try to squeeze it all into one week
[01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:25.960]   Well, you know what's interesting so sam's on having an event tomorrow morning. We're gonna cover it stream at live 7am
[01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:30.040]   It's not a ces event, but it's the same week as ces
[01:14:30.040 --> 01:14:35.240]   There's something you know normally they'd wait to efa or more world congress. I guess that's the next one mobile
[01:14:35.240 --> 01:14:38.200]   but there's something about
[01:14:39.480 --> 01:14:45.320]   You would think they would want to do it away from it so that there isn't else other channel people are interested
[01:14:45.320 --> 01:14:50.040]   I think that's it people are. Do you ever did you ever go to a lobby cone?
[01:14:50.040 --> 01:14:53.320]   No, I've heard many things about it. It was in Hawaii, right?
[01:14:53.320 --> 01:14:56.280]   Well, there were there were some
[01:14:56.280 --> 01:14:59.000]   In different places and the idea was just that you would
[01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:05.560]   Hang out in the lobby and not actually go to the best part of the conference is the lobby. Yeah, yeah interesting
[01:15:06.200 --> 01:15:12.440]   Never heard of that. Yeah, so we're gonna be uh, Jason howl and florence iron will be covering the samsung unpacked event
[01:15:12.440 --> 01:15:16.280]   It'll be the announcement on the galaxy s 21 phone much of which has been leaked
[01:15:16.280 --> 01:15:24.280]   Already 7am pacific tema and eastern tomorrow thursday. I'm not getting up early tomorrow miss le pore
[01:15:24.280 --> 01:15:30.040]   Attempted I might want to buy one of these things. I don't know why i'm not getting up
[01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:36.040]   Early all week so far and those those virtual conferences have warned me out. Yes
[01:15:36.120 --> 01:15:37.720]   You know
[01:15:37.720 --> 01:15:42.920]   But you don't have to get up early because not only will we stream it live we will make a show out of it and you can download
[01:15:42.920 --> 01:15:47.640]   So you will have every the magic of podcasts amazing
[01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:53.080]   Google did a thing with news guys. Sorry. I was just gonna mention that they I think it was news guys
[01:15:53.080 --> 01:15:55.880]   They had different sessions at different times
[01:15:55.880 --> 01:16:00.840]   Catering to people in different times. That's a good idea. They did 24 hours straight
[01:16:01.560 --> 01:16:05.640]   Oh, you can different times those they also used a great platform. Have you heard of wonder.me?
[01:16:05.640 --> 01:16:11.480]   It's really nice. It's um, it's the first because
[01:16:11.480 --> 01:16:17.080]   It's the effort to replicate the lobby, right? Oh, you look like you're all sitting at round tables
[01:16:17.080 --> 01:16:23.080]   Uh, right so you can move around you move yourself around when you get next to somebody then the video pops up. Oh, that's kind of cool
[01:16:23.080 --> 01:16:27.960]   It's very nice. It's very nice indeed. I like to the law. We used it for our graduation
[01:16:27.960 --> 01:16:31.000]   for the reception afterwards
[01:16:31.160 --> 01:16:34.600]   Good idea. Oh so cool. Oh, it's really really nice
[01:16:34.600 --> 01:16:40.120]   So so many needs to have an interface that's basically just like a hobo hotel like an eight bit
[01:16:40.120 --> 01:16:42.840]   You know, uh, scroller
[01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:45.400]   Game and that's your lobby and you get a little
[01:16:45.400 --> 01:16:52.120]   A bit character and you wander around from virtual room here. I think we could do this. That was that was called nintendo. We
[01:16:52.120 --> 01:17:00.680]   I would like to use one or me for our chat room. It's like I think it's really very good. Yeah, it's excellent
[01:17:01.400 --> 01:17:07.240]   Um, so you you can make a table with a label. Yeah, um, you can just wander around you see somebody you see you just
[01:17:07.240 --> 01:17:09.320]   When you sittle up next to them
[01:17:09.320 --> 01:17:12.920]   Then the video pops up and you can talk that you can also make a private room
[01:17:12.920 --> 01:17:16.360]   So nobody can come in you can you can talk about, you know about leo
[01:17:16.360 --> 01:17:22.040]   Matthew you and i can go talk about leo and he can't get in great. Um, uh, it's really very nice
[01:17:22.040 --> 01:17:27.640]   I was like high school. It's like high school. It's like, yeah, exactly. Don't you can't sit at my table
[01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:31.320]   Cool kids table right kids girls. That's really interesting
[01:17:31.320 --> 01:17:38.120]   Guess can see who's speaking to whom they will be there avatars around their mobs google uh newscast
[01:17:38.120 --> 01:17:46.280]   Very cool. Yeah, um, hey, I want to do the change log in uh in just a second
[01:17:46.280 --> 01:17:48.440]   Aunt pruit
[01:17:48.440 --> 01:17:50.440]   Uh, matthew ingraham jeff javis
[01:17:50.440 --> 01:17:54.520]   Uh for those just tuning in stays he's not with us because a tree fell on a
[01:17:55.240 --> 01:18:00.600]   Powerline near her house. She's fine. She's fine house is fine powers out. It's tasty
[01:18:00.600 --> 01:18:04.600]   Power is out, but her ears are burning
[01:18:04.600 --> 01:18:11.800]   Uh now it's time for the google changelog
[01:18:11.800 --> 01:18:15.000]   the google changelog
[01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:19.560]   I should have probably looked to see if there is anything before I
[01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:28.760]   Oh, yeah, a little scant of late and right auto moves closer to wallpapers support
[01:18:28.760 --> 01:18:35.320]   With a collection of car themed backgrounds, you know, that's what I've been missing with android auto
[01:18:35.320 --> 01:18:38.280]   That's innovation right there. I need some wallpaper
[01:18:38.280 --> 01:18:42.520]   Uh google's rolling out guest mode
[01:18:42.520 --> 01:18:45.240]   to the nest hubs
[01:18:45.240 --> 01:18:46.840]   and assistance
[01:18:46.840 --> 01:18:48.280]   A guest mode
[01:18:48.280 --> 01:18:49.400]   What?
[01:18:49.400 --> 01:18:53.480]   What? When it's enabled google assistant interactions are not saved to your account
[01:18:53.480 --> 01:18:57.320]   Audio recordings for voice commands will be deleted automatically
[01:18:57.320 --> 01:19:03.800]   You can't incognito it's kind of more like an incognito you could still ask questions control home devices set timers
[01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:07.480]   Uh broadcast still works family bell still functions
[01:19:07.480 --> 01:19:10.200]   Household contact speed dial still works
[01:19:10.200 --> 01:19:15.160]   If you've got photo frames set in the background as I do it'll still cycle
[01:19:15.960 --> 01:19:21.320]   Because i load for amazon now, so you can look at that page and it won't crack you
[01:19:21.320 --> 01:19:23.960]   I do for any time i look at chastity belts up you bet
[01:19:23.960 --> 01:19:29.400]   So you can ask your assistant how do I bury a body and then it wouldn't say that
[01:19:29.400 --> 01:19:32.840]   Exactly it wouldn't remember that that's okay personal results like
[01:19:32.840 --> 01:19:39.400]   The calendar events and contacts are automatically disabled so what you do is you say hey
[01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:42.440]   Guillermo turn on
[01:19:44.760 --> 01:19:49.080]   I bet you that triggers it anyway. Hey guillermo turn on
[01:19:49.080 --> 01:19:56.200]   No, okay turn on this good. We found finally something I could say hey guillermo. Hey guerbe
[01:19:56.200 --> 01:19:59.560]   Does that work? Hey guerbe
[01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:06.120]   Yeah, it's good. It's good where it works. Okay. Don't say guerbe. Okay. Hey guillermo turn on guest mode
[01:20:06.120 --> 01:20:08.600]   And you'll get a special chime
[01:20:08.600 --> 01:20:12.920]   And then a blank profile icon will appear throughout the interface
[01:20:13.320 --> 01:20:18.920]   You can ask it at any time hey guillermo is guest mode on and it will say so and then of course
[01:20:18.920 --> 01:20:24.040]   When you're done you can say guillermo turn off guest mode
[01:20:24.040 --> 01:20:28.840]   It's kind of interesting
[01:20:28.840 --> 01:20:32.680]   Out now i'll try it now try it see what happens don't say guillermo though
[01:20:32.680 --> 01:20:42.440]   I mean guest mode in any assistant activity will be deleted from the device owner's account
[01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:50.840]   It really is you know, we say tell me about guest mode. It really is in cognito mode. That's really cool. Yeah, that's a good idea. Nice. Thanks
[01:20:50.840 --> 01:20:58.120]   Google had an issue. I don't know if you noticed this on their covet 19 api google house

[01:22:19.160 --> 01:22:21.160]   YouTube videos
[01:22:21.160 --> 01:22:25.240]   I don't you have to explain this one to me that use hash tags
[01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:28.520]   Now have their own dedicated sections
[01:22:28.520 --> 01:22:33.720]   Hashtag i'm confused hashtag. What does that mean?
[01:22:34.440 --> 01:22:39.640]   Hashtag i don't really care you put um, I haven't read just channels. I guess change log
[01:22:39.640 --> 01:22:42.440]   But if you put hashtags in your titling
[01:22:42.440 --> 01:22:44.280]   Uh
[01:22:44.280 --> 01:22:47.320]   On your youtube video if you put a hashtag at the end of your title
[01:22:47.320 --> 01:22:50.760]   It doesn't show in the title display, right?
[01:22:50.760 --> 01:22:53.480]   But it does give it a hashtag like a subheading
[01:22:53.480 --> 01:22:58.280]   And then you can search for a specific hashtag. Right. Interesting. Oh, we'll have to start using that
[01:22:58.280 --> 01:23:01.880]   So that we can you know, uh, people could search for
[01:23:02.520 --> 01:23:11.400]   Specific things so put in Justin Bieber hashtag hashtag moral panic. I gotta do some s um. Yeah, that's it. Yeah, that's it

[01:23:41.640 --> 01:23:43.880]   and that
[01:23:43.880 --> 01:23:45.880]   Is the google change log?
[01:23:45.880 --> 01:23:50.280]   We were I should really save this uh for

[01:24:10.280 --> 01:24:15.640]   june will continue to develop new ovens and accessories, but it'll just be uh, you know, uh,
[01:24:15.640 --> 01:24:20.680]   I imagine this was uh, you know, one of those things where it was tough to succeed and
[01:24:20.680 --> 01:24:26.760]   Uh, you know, it's great to have a bigger partner who will give you some cash and let you do more
[01:24:27.640 --> 01:24:29.640]   uh junes founder
[01:24:29.640 --> 01:24:32.440]   Uh and ceo matt van horn

[01:24:45.400 --> 01:24:49.560]   Oh some credence to what you guys were just saying. We don't know how much they paid
[01:24:49.560 --> 01:24:52.360]   But I know I paid 1500 dollars for my june oven
[01:24:52.360 --> 01:24:55.480]   Which now what should we most want deal
[01:24:55.720 --> 01:24:58.680]   Uh, oh now it's like down a couple hundred three hundred bucks. I don't know they got it
[01:24:58.680 --> 01:25:03.640]   It's much much less expensive now. I bought you know early adopter. It doesn't pay just doesn't pay
[01:25:03.640 --> 01:25:07.240]   um
[01:25:07.240 --> 01:25:12.040]   Big big jump for signal after people
[01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:16.200]   Started worrying about the privacy policies of what's app which is known by facebook
[01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:18.440]   What's app said, you know, we don't see your messages
[01:25:18.440 --> 01:25:23.560]   But we do reserve the right to record your meta data who you're talking to what the subjects are things like that
[01:25:23.880 --> 01:25:29.960]   And share it with facebook and uh boy signal june the completely encrypted solution that doesn't
[01:25:29.960 --> 01:25:33.240]   Uh share your metadata doesn't even see your metadata
[01:25:33.240 --> 01:25:35.800]   Suddenly taking off like crazy, which is great
[01:25:35.800 --> 01:25:38.440]   Which is great telegram too. I think
[01:25:38.440 --> 01:25:41.480]   Telegram is taken off
[01:25:41.480 --> 01:25:43.240]   Absolutely, although as you pointed out
[01:25:43.240 --> 01:25:50.520]   It uh, it can also be a haven as as can signal. I guess anything encrypted can be even for bad actors. Yep
[01:25:52.280 --> 01:25:55.800]   And then I was doing to say I didn't mention this when we were talking about it, but
[01:25:55.800 --> 01:25:58.360]   before
[01:25:58.360 --> 01:26:03.240]   sort of all the trump related stuff and the capital riots and everything facebook
[01:26:03.240 --> 01:26:06.040]   started making a
[01:26:06.040 --> 01:26:08.680]   Significant move towards
[01:26:08.680 --> 01:26:14.200]   More private messaging private groups. Yeah, yeah, and I know when um
[01:26:14.200 --> 01:26:19.000]   When I was talking to security types and and disinformation types
[01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:22.360]   They were very concerned about it being harder to find
[01:26:22.360 --> 01:26:28.600]   and track information partly because it's a lot of it's going to be encrypted and private
[01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:31.960]   Which is good
[01:26:31.960 --> 01:26:38.280]   Craig newmark funded a commission on information disorder. Who's the head
[01:26:38.280 --> 01:26:41.160]   the former uh head of
[01:26:41.160 --> 01:26:42.840]   Sissa
[01:26:42.840 --> 01:26:47.160]   The crubs criss crabs the guy who was fired for saying one of the election was fair and
[01:26:47.720 --> 01:26:49.720]   secure the most secure election we've ever had
[01:26:49.720 --> 01:26:57.560]   Uh, thank aspen institute. Oh, it's the aspen institute. Okay. Yeah, so crabs has also formed a um
[01:26:57.560 --> 01:27:00.680]   a new company
[01:27:00.680 --> 01:27:03.480]   with uh, Alex stamos the ks group
[01:27:03.480 --> 01:27:06.920]   stamos the former security guy at um
[01:27:06.920 --> 01:27:10.680]   Yeah, uh, facebook and before that yahoo
[01:27:10.680 --> 01:27:13.720]   He left in both cases because he didn't like what was going on
[01:27:13.720 --> 01:27:16.760]   Um, did I say stamos?
[01:27:17.480 --> 01:27:19.480]   Isn't that isn't that's not his name. Is it?
[01:27:19.480 --> 01:27:26.680]   That's stamos stamos. Is it stables? It's not the guy. I got it wrong. You're right. Um, not john stamos

[01:27:43.400 --> 01:27:44.840]   It's not stamos
[01:27:44.840 --> 01:27:50.360]   Yeah, security is really taking. I mean, this is you know job one now after the solar winds attack
[01:27:50.360 --> 01:27:55.240]   Uh, in fact solar winds has announced that chris craves will also be consulting them
[01:27:55.240 --> 01:27:58.680]   Uh to help button down their security course
[01:27:58.680 --> 01:28:01.480]   They they should hire everybody like
[01:28:01.480 --> 01:28:07.240]   From high school op it's it's like zoom did right zoom went out and said okay. We need a bunch of people
[01:28:07.240 --> 01:28:09.480]   a bunch of them
[01:28:09.480 --> 01:28:17.080]   I think a zoom did right was a listen to them. Right. And I you know the problem with solar winds is it's closing the barn door after the horse
[01:28:17.080 --> 01:28:19.880]   Is gone you could fix it now. It doesn't really matter
[01:28:19.880 --> 01:28:26.200]   Horses over the horizon horses long gone
[01:28:26.200 --> 01:28:28.840]   Yeah, I posted something about
[01:28:28.840 --> 01:28:35.480]   Trump where I said horses incorporated is concerned about the recent incident and has altered its door closure
[01:28:37.960 --> 01:28:42.680]   I love it. See there's another reason to follow to follow you on twitter
[01:28:42.680 --> 01:28:47.080]   Um
[01:28:47.080 --> 01:28:52.280]   Um, I know you know, I guess we should talk about this github
[01:28:52.280 --> 01:28:54.920]   Although as as I always do when we talk about employment
[01:28:54.920 --> 01:29:00.920]   Issues you never know the real story because law protects employees and privacy and so forth
[01:29:00.920 --> 01:29:02.360]   but
[01:29:02.360 --> 01:29:04.440]   github apparently fired
[01:29:04.440 --> 01:29:07.000]   one of their employees
[01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:10.440]   Who is jewish and who had family members who died in the holocaust
[01:29:10.440 --> 01:29:14.680]   For posting in a message on its internal slack channel
[01:29:14.680 --> 01:29:19.320]   Uh last wednesday saying stay safe home. He's nazis are about
[01:29:19.320 --> 01:29:24.040]   He was concerned about co-workers. He says who lived in washington dc
[01:29:24.040 --> 01:29:31.560]   Uh did not intend it in any way to be it's just you know, it's I guess it's the new n-word. I don't know 200
[01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:34.600]   Uh github employees of sign a letter asking executives
[01:29:36.040 --> 01:29:40.600]   Why he was fired but also to take a stronger stance against anti-semitism and white supremacy
[01:29:40.600 --> 01:29:42.760]   So there's kind of a mixed message there
[01:29:42.760 --> 01:29:45.640]   Uh, we don't know what happened
[01:29:45.640 --> 01:29:51.240]   He said he didn't doesn't want anybody to know who he is because he's afraid of being told obviously
[01:29:51.240 --> 01:29:52.920]   He said I did not know
[01:29:52.920 --> 01:29:56.520]   That as a Jew it would be so polarizing to say this word
[01:29:56.520 --> 01:30:03.240]   We grew up saying nazi. It was a story we told because we had to the decimation of whole lines of ancestry
[01:30:03.240 --> 01:30:08.680]   We're at the hands of people who went by that title. Is it possible people are worried about offending nazis now? No
[01:30:08.680 --> 01:30:11.480]   That can't be it
[01:30:11.480 --> 01:30:16.680]   I just saw an academic fight going on to me see the stiter and somebody else from i forget which university
[01:30:16.680 --> 01:30:19.160]   Uh, you know, are these fascists or not?
[01:30:19.160 --> 01:30:22.440]   And that's an academic fight going on on a different level
[01:30:22.440 --> 01:30:26.200]   Um
[01:30:26.200 --> 01:30:31.400]   It's not they're not fascist and let unless they come from the fast east region of france
[01:30:32.680 --> 01:30:35.480]   Yes, that's a protected domain. Of course everybody knows that
[01:30:35.480 --> 01:30:39.240]   Quibi, uh, which raised 1.75 billion dollars
[01:30:39.240 --> 01:30:44.840]   Uh, of which of course it closed its doors has saved a little bit of that investment
[01:30:44.840 --> 01:30:51.160]   They sold their entire library of videos both current and future to roku
[01:30:51.160 --> 01:30:53.880]   For less than a hundred million dollars
[01:30:53.880 --> 01:31:02.520]   Uh, they did not sell however the rotating screen technology, but that's going to be one of the biggest and bonfires of value
[01:31:02.760 --> 01:31:07.320]   Since a well-timed warning from 1.75 billion to less than a hundred million
[01:31:07.320 --> 01:31:14.440]   Uh, do you ever you know, new york? I loved the hudson newsstands they were everywhere
[01:31:14.440 --> 01:31:19.320]   They're still they're still everywhere, but just not as crowded. Yeah, well, don't worry
[01:31:19.320 --> 01:31:22.360]   Uh because they're trying out a new concept using amazon's
[01:31:22.360 --> 01:31:25.160]   Just walk out technology where you just
[01:31:25.160 --> 01:31:32.200]   Wow, I guess this is at the airport the airport. Okay. That's the idea. Yeah, you just yeah
[01:31:32.600 --> 01:31:36.120]   I see these anyway and I wonder why don't people steal more stuff from them
[01:31:36.120 --> 01:31:41.800]   They're unattended or the attendant is way down the hall or something and you're supposed to look at the new work airport now
[01:31:41.800 --> 01:31:44.120]   You're supposed to check yourself out
[01:31:44.120 --> 01:31:48.200]   Okay, see this is an honor system. Yeah. Yeah, we're kind of yeah
[01:31:48.200 --> 01:31:53.000]   So, uh love field and dallas will be the first
[01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:55.240]   uh
[01:31:55.240 --> 01:31:57.240]   for the just walkout technology
[01:31:57.240 --> 01:32:00.040]   in uh
[01:32:00.040 --> 01:32:03.080]   We're always looking for new ways to expand seamless and safe travel
[01:32:03.080 --> 01:32:09.000]   Now, you know, I guess if you don't have to talk to or touch a cashier, that's probably a good thing
[01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:19.080]   Prime way social. Could you get leo geez. I don't like especially especially in an airport. I'm gonna wear my razor smart mask from now on
[01:32:19.080 --> 01:32:22.840]   Uh, I think this would be a good time
[01:32:22.840 --> 01:32:25.000]   to uh
[01:32:25.000 --> 01:32:27.000]   wrap this thing up
[01:32:27.960 --> 01:32:29.960]   He's singing sea shaddies again
[01:32:29.960 --> 01:32:40.840]   And go are you are you a singer jeff?
[01:32:40.840 --> 01:32:48.840]   I I wasn't the church choir. You were in the choir and you're a clarinet clarinet. I was in the college choir. Oh, that's me and you're a base
[01:32:48.840 --> 01:32:53.640]   Yeah, yeah, whatever that buddy buddy

[01:32:57.320 --> 01:33:00.120]   Uh, we are gonna get our picks of the week up next
[01:33:00.120 --> 01:33:04.360]   Let's kick the picks of the week off with our guest
[01:33:04.360 --> 01:33:07.000]   Matthew engram who has a new
[01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:09.480]   favorite word
[01:33:09.480 --> 01:33:16.920]   Yeah, this is uh, I don't know if i'm gonna pronounce it correctly. It's uh umorrel umorrel uh, so yeah, it's um
[01:33:16.920 --> 01:33:21.960]   It's a town. Well, it's kind of Italian. It's uh bolognese
[01:33:21.960 --> 01:33:24.520]   and it's from a word
[01:33:24.760 --> 01:33:32.360]   That means men of retirement age who pass the time watching construction sites, especially roadworks offering unwanted advice
[01:33:32.360 --> 01:33:36.680]   God bless italy. God bless italy. I just love that that's a word
[01:33:36.680 --> 01:33:41.960]   And if you if you if you read the thread
[01:33:41.960 --> 01:33:46.760]   A bunch of people point out that uh, it's very important that you clasp your hands behind your back
[01:33:46.760 --> 01:33:49.400]   That you wear a hat
[01:33:49.400 --> 01:33:53.720]   Maybe bereish type hat if you have a small yapping dog. This is extra
[01:33:54.520 --> 01:33:56.520]   authentic and um
[01:33:56.520 --> 01:34:01.000]   You can buy apparently a umorrel
[01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.720]   Figuring to watch you work
[01:34:03.720 --> 01:34:10.120]   Yeah, yeah big dog not included you have to supply the critical comments that is hysterical
[01:34:10.120 --> 01:34:15.480]   This this would be a perfect spinoff of those progressive commercials
[01:34:15.480 --> 01:34:21.880]   Uh, or they're trying to teach people how to not be their parents. Yes. I love those commercials
[01:34:22.040 --> 01:34:27.160]   I cannot get enough of those commercials doctor re there the greatest there's three now. I think
[01:34:27.160 --> 01:34:29.720]   They've added some you don't know him
[01:34:29.720 --> 01:34:33.560]   It's a way to wait
[01:34:33.560 --> 01:34:38.280]   Sorry
[01:34:38.280 --> 01:34:41.400]   Umorrel it's 18 euros. It's not a cheap umorrel
[01:34:41.400 --> 01:34:47.160]   Umorrel a was anciano digitali que dose ever cantieri digitali
[01:34:47.160 --> 01:34:49.720]   Yveso street compoteur
[01:34:50.280 --> 01:34:53.000]   Oh, that's nice. And now say cat to a pippy
[01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.400]   Got you a pippy. No, no, no
[01:34:55.400 --> 01:34:57.560]   Jeffle take off
[01:34:57.560 --> 01:35:01.080]   Yeah, why don't you go out now we better get him to do his number of the week real quick
[01:35:01.080 --> 01:35:07.880]   All right, I was debating between two of them. Um, well, we were uh, so the Edelman trust barometer is out
[01:35:07.880 --> 01:35:11.160]   And uh, this is shocking
[01:35:11.160 --> 01:35:16.360]   It usually happens at uh, davos, but at the undavos where there's next today
[01:35:16.360 --> 01:35:19.400]   Uh, richard edelman revealed it and if you go to slide
[01:35:19.880 --> 01:35:22.760]   Uh, nine you start to see the beginnings of the real numbers
[01:35:22.760 --> 01:35:27.880]   Among the mass population they trust no institutions
[01:35:27.880 --> 01:35:32.120]   Yeah among the so-called lelet or informed population that trusts three out of five
[01:35:32.120 --> 01:35:36.600]   Which is to say ngo's business and media, but not government. I don't know what the fifth is
[01:35:36.600 --> 01:35:38.120]   Um
[01:35:38.120 --> 01:35:42.760]   Majority of people are pessimistic in 15 out of 28 markets including the us
[01:35:42.760 --> 01:35:47.720]   The majority of people in 21 out of 28 markets fear being left behind
[01:35:48.280 --> 01:35:53.640]   Yeah, 56% believe the capitalism as it is today does more harm than good in the world
[01:35:53.640 --> 01:35:55.640]   Wow now is this global or us?
[01:35:55.640 --> 01:36:00.520]   This is global. This is global. Yeah, because in the us i'm sure that number is much lower
[01:36:00.520 --> 01:36:05.880]   I worry about losing my job due to one or more of these causes 83%
[01:36:05.880 --> 01:36:12.120]   You want to you know, well a lot of what happened last week at the capital was not economic dammit
[01:36:12.120 --> 01:36:13.480]   It was racial
[01:36:13.480 --> 01:36:15.480]   But there also is economic fear
[01:36:15.640 --> 01:36:21.000]   Fear because of freelancer gig economy 61% lubing recession 60% lack of training and skills
[01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:26.040]   Major societal obligation 58% cheaper foreign competitors
[01:36:26.040 --> 01:36:34.200]   More more authentic there 55% immigrants work for less a lot of more authentic there 54% automation for 3% jobs moving to other countries
[01:36:34.200 --> 01:36:39.240]   So anyway, that's a quick one but the other one that I saw I found interesting was
[01:36:39.240 --> 01:36:41.160]   that
[01:36:41.160 --> 01:36:45.720]   uh people returned four hundred twenty eight billion dollars of merchandise
[01:36:45.720 --> 01:36:50.600]   Oh, I thought this was really interesting. I know you're talking it is. Yeah, um
[01:36:50.600 --> 01:36:59.400]   And then so what's happening is that is that amazon walmart and company use a i to judge whether it's worthwhile to get the return or not
[01:36:59.400 --> 01:37:03.800]   In terms of how they can resell it and shipping so a lot of times they just tell people
[01:37:03.800 --> 01:37:06.920]   Keep it give it away to a charity whatever
[01:37:08.040 --> 01:37:11.080]   Expencer story for the return. Yeah, that's fine
[01:37:11.080 --> 01:37:17.320]   But they do and the AI is used for a number of things but but a lot of it is your past buying record
[01:37:17.320 --> 01:37:21.800]   So if you don't get watched yeah, don't get excited that oh god. I never have to buy anything again
[01:37:21.800 --> 01:37:24.760]   I used to know a young woman who would buy shoes
[01:37:24.760 --> 01:37:27.000]   Tape the souls
[01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:32.440]   Wear them to the event remove the tape because you can't return use shoes remove the tapes
[01:37:32.440 --> 01:37:34.440]   So there was no evidence and return them
[01:37:34.760 --> 01:37:39.000]   She never flipped my wallet or rear end because the tape slippery. I know I would probably use good tape
[01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:42.440]   She learned over time, but she never bought shoes. She didn't have to
[01:37:42.440 --> 01:37:47.240]   Uh, I don't think this would be an excuse to do that. No
[01:37:47.240 --> 01:37:53.640]   For every billion dollar in sales a hundred and six million dollars is lost to returns
[01:37:53.640 --> 01:38:01.640]   Of course there's huge companies that do nothing but take back the returns right get them in some saleable form
[01:38:01.640 --> 01:38:05.800]   And that's where you you get a lot of these places to buy stuff right right um
[01:38:05.800 --> 01:38:07.880]   Liquidators
[01:38:07.880 --> 01:38:12.760]   Yeah, liquidators. Thank you. Yep. Well, I look like there's also take over bank replaces. Yeah, right?
[01:38:12.760 --> 01:38:17.160]   Right. I did a story about a chain of liquidators and it was fascinating. They
[01:38:17.160 --> 01:38:20.840]   They would take literally anything truckloads. He said what
[01:38:20.840 --> 01:38:25.640]   Depends on the day one day it'll be a truckload of paint, you know, then we'll get
[01:38:25.640 --> 01:38:29.160]   five truckloads of baby shoes or like
[01:38:30.920 --> 01:38:33.880]   To remember jeff repo depot
[01:38:33.880 --> 01:38:37.240]   Yeah
[01:38:37.240 --> 01:38:41.880]   I actually knew the founder of repo depot
[01:38:41.880 --> 01:38:44.680]   Nice

[01:40:50.120 --> 01:40:56.200]   Well during CES they have updated their product and I enjoyed their product. It's only about $170
[01:40:56.200 --> 01:41:03.640]   But it's basically giving you all of your tools in one hand for the likes of it's a busy box shop for creators
[01:41:03.640 --> 01:41:07.800]   It's it's so so slick and then they have a nice
[01:41:07.800 --> 01:41:13.480]   Development community behind them to where you don't necessarily have to just use it for photoshop in lightroom
[01:41:13.480 --> 01:41:19.080]   You can use it with capture one you can use it with premiere you can use it with the vinci resolve
[01:41:19.160 --> 01:41:22.120]   You can use it with a lot of different apps because they've opened it up
[01:41:22.120 --> 01:41:27.880]   To where people can develop presets for it and it's uh pretty slick. I liked it last year
[01:41:27.880 --> 01:41:32.680]   Nice 169 bucks. Yep, tour box tech.com
[01:41:32.680 --> 01:41:37.560]   And the next one is something that you made like this just came out today
[01:41:37.560 --> 01:41:46.040]   Um, sony announced their new 35 mil g master. Oh, I saw that and I thought of you immediately look at the price of that
[01:41:46.360 --> 01:41:53.000]   Yeah, that price is great compared to some of the other ones just just so people understand
[01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:58.760]   How how gear addled camera folks are that great price is
[01:41:58.760 --> 01:42:01.560]   $1,398
[01:42:01.560 --> 01:42:10.280]   But it is a prime lens 35 millimeter f1.4 and then therefore their gold master lenses are quite nice. They're really nice
[01:42:10.280 --> 01:42:15.720]   You pay for that aperture. That's why that's a great lens. Yeah, I thought about you. I was like, yeah
