[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.800]   Recorded Valentine's Day, February 14, 2018.
[00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.800]   The Fritter Critter.

[00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.800]   It's time for Twig this week in Google,
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.000]   where we will cover whatever the heck we want to.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.300]   We've already been delving deep into word meanings and etymologies.
[00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.500]   Stacey Higginbotham has four books about it.
[00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.500]   She's from stacey.ioT.com.
[00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.800]   Hi Stacey!
[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.300]   Hello you guys!
[00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.300]   Great to see you. Thank you so much for your help in Austin.
[00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.300]   We've got a great panel coming up, thanks to you.
[00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.800]   I'm still looking for some more people, I'll be honest.
[00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.300]   Well, I like the ones you've set up.
[00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.300]   I think you and two other people, both of whom I think you suggested.
[00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.300]   So thank you.
[00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:42.300]   Yes.
[00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:43.300]   I really thank you.
[00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.300]   We'll tell you more about that in a little bit.
[00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.300]   Also here Kevin Marks,
[00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.300]   he of the indie web,
[00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.300]   protector of all things original internet.
[00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:55.800]   Thank you Kevin, good to see you.
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.800]   That's the hope.
[00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.300]   And speaking of the original internet, Jeff Jarvis, who predates...
[00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.300]   I'm that old.
[00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.800]   Even the internet is from buzzmachine.com,
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.300]   professor of journalism at the city of University of New York.
[00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.800]   And he's on hiatus?
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.300]   No, you're on Walkabout.
[00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.800]   You're an Amsterdam.
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.800]   I'm an Amsterdam at the Google Digital News Initiative event.
[00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.800]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.800]   I love Amsterdam.
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:23.800]   I do too well.
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:24.800]   Not either of these things.
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.300]   No, no, no, no.
[00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.800]   In fact, somebody told me pot is not legal in Amsterdam.
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.800]   But I believe it's unenforced.
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.800]   The law is unenforced.
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.800]   Yeah, and I think I'm not sure the tourists can do it anymore.
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.800]   The coffee shop, I don't know if there was a kind of a crack out of that.
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.800]   But I walked by tons of cafes and you have that little skunky spell all the time.
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:52.800]   I can come to California where it is legal for tourists and people who live here.
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:58.800]   Completely legal, like recreational, medicinal, any kind of all.
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.800]   Do you have to be a certain age?
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.800]   Yeah, you have to be 21, just like booze.
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:03.800]   Okay.
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.800]   And I think you can't, just like smoking cigarettes, you can't just walk around smoking.
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.800]   Or maybe you can, I don't know.
[00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.800]   I haven't tried.
[00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.800]   In New York, it's not like it'll be a small one straight.
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:15.800]   Oh, God, this is going to do it.
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:16.800]   You know, the smell is so annoying.
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:17.800]   It's interesting.
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.800]   Netflix had a show about pot, a cannabis show.
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:21.800]   They just canceled it.
[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.800]   I think people, I think now that it's legal in so many states, people are like, "I'm over
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:26.800]   it.
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.800]   It's only interesting if it's forbidden."
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:37.800]   All right, as long as you're at the New York Initiative, of course, one of the things
[00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.800]   Richard Gengris, I presume Richard's there.
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:40.800]   Yeah?
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:41.800]   Yes, he is.
[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:42.800]   I saw him tonight.
[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:47.680]   So he's in charge of the Google News Initiative and was here to defend AMP.
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:48.680]   Now defend this.
[00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:53.520]   They're bringing the power of AMP to Gmail.
[00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.800]   AMP stands for Accelerated Mobile Pages.
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:03.200]   It was created in an era where websites were so heavy that they just were unusable on mobile.
[00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.800]   And Google created this extension.
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:11.280]   It's not official, you know, W3C standard or anything.
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.960]   But it's an extension that prohibits a lot of heavyweight stuff, only allows JavaScript
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:20.360]   served, approved and served by Google.
[00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:24.200]   Images are limited, stuff like that.
[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:29.040]   So let me ask Kevin as a defender of the Open Web.
[00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.680]   I don't know if we've ever talked about AMP with you.
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.600]   How do you feel about AMP?
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:34.600]   Am I?
[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.120]   I think we talked about it just after it was launched.
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.120]   Right in the beginning.
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.120]   Yeah.
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.120]   Yeah.
[00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.120]   I thought it was about the beginning.
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.520]   I made a page that embedded that show that was an AMP.
[00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:44.520]   I remember that.
[00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:45.520]   Yes.
[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:50.720]   So I think, you know, there's trade-offs in it.
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:56.240]   So part of the thing that I don't like about it is that it replaces some of the basic HTML
[00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.800]   elements with special AMP elements.
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:03.200]   So images and videos, things that HTML will do natively, it requires you to replace them
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:04.200]   with the AMP ones.
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.080]   That means they have to load JavaScript to execute.
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:13.480]   Which means that you are dependent on the JavaScript from Google loading first.
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:18.480]   The thing that's good about it is that it has actually made it, particularly in news
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:22.960]   organizations, think about having pages that load quickly.
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.840]   And that was, so in that respect, it's achieved.
[00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.520]   But it's now getting to the point where they're there, they're trying stuff into it.
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:37.840]   So as well as they're putting in Gmail thing, there's also, oh, we need something like stories
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:38.840]   in it.
[00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:42.600]   So there's a way of doing stories in AMP now.
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:47.200]   Which is a, which is stories in the Twitter moment stroke Instagram stories.
[00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:48.200]   Right.
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:49.200]   You have, I found your page.
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.560]   And this actually goes back to 2015.
[00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.160]   Kevinmarks.com/ampreaction.html.
[00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.320]   And it even has a clip from the show when we talked about it.
[00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:58.520]   I'll tell you how long ago this was.
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:59.760]   Jeff has no facial hair.
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.720]   Yeah, we're looking on.
[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:03.240]   Yeah.
[00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:05.240]   But now that they want to...
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.240]   I just found a show.
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.240]   It's just a clip.
[00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.480]   Oh, it's a whole show.
[00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:13.720]   Since then, AMP has, I think some people have turned around on AMP a little bit.
[00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.840]   And now Google wants to bring AMP to Gmail.
[00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:21.160]   Explain what that means.
[00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:25.320]   A powerful way for developers to create more engaging, interactive, and actionable email
[00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:26.320]   experiences.
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:32.080]   First of all, I'm not a fan of HTML in email anyway, but for a lot of people, email newsletters
[00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.440]   are a big part of their economic activity.
[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:35.800]   Even us, we use...
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.400]   And Jason Calicans is always saying, "And you..."
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:39.400]   Kevin...
[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:43.480]   Yes, Stacey Igenbotham actually, that's her bread and butter's her email newsletter on
[00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:44.480]   IoT.
[00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:46.400]   So those are HTML, right?
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.200]   Stacey, you use some tool to make that.
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:50.200]   Those are...
[00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:52.320]   Yes, I do use some tool to make it.
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:58.360]   I use MailChimp and I have someone who codes the templates and stuff for me in HTML.
[00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:02.600]   So I guess I'm gathering that that's the purpose of AMP.
[00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:06.960]   Because if ever, I guess all Gmail is ultimately HTML, I don't know.
[00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:08.360]   I always try to send my emails.
[00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.600]   You can strip the HTML out of it, but...
[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.600]   Well, you wouldn't get any pictures.
[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:13.600]   Well, that's...
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.600]   That's kind of the reason.
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:20.920]   Well, and I think isn't this to help?
[00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:25.000]   It is annoying when you're on your mobile phone to start something in email and then
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:31.320]   end up opening a whole new app and then you're away from email and then you forget what you
[00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:32.320]   were originally doing.
[00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:37.760]   Like, the hardest, the biggest challenge for me when trying to triage and make my way through
[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:44.280]   email on my phone is that I have to go around so many places and it's stupid and it's non-productive.
[00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:46.000]   So I actually am looking forward to that.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.120]   Well, the best kind of amping of email would be just plain text email, not HTML email.
[00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:53.440]   But if you're going to do HTML email, I guess this makes sense.
[00:07:53.440 --> 00:07:56.920]   And that's, by the way, it looks like what Google's doing is reaching out to people like
[00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:03.520]   you and your developer to use AMP when you make an HTML email.
[00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:10.800]   Now, the challenges with AMP Stories was always that once you made something an AMP link,
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:15.560]   it was AMP or else and you, you like, lost it, correct?
[00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:16.560]   There was...
[00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:18.520]   Sorry, that was a terrible way to explain that.
[00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:19.520]   No, you could always...
[00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:20.520]   No, you could have two versions.
[00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:21.520]   You could have an on-app version.
[00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:22.520]   Right.
[00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:24.440]   But you would have to do two versions.
[00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:26.440]   You couldn't just...
[00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:27.440]   Yeah.
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:28.440]   Yes.
[00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:31.320]   Well, you could just sort the AMP version.
[00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:32.320]   Yeah.
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:36.560]   But it's going to be relying on Google.
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:37.560]   This is...
[00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:40.880]   And also Google will cache the AMP version and serve it directly from there.
[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:41.880]   Right.
[00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:44.120]   If you choose, you don't have to do that.
[00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:45.120]   Is...
[00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:47.680]   Yeah, I mean, Google always said, "Oh, anybody can run an AMP server, but I wonder how many
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:50.360]   people are running AMP servers."
[00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:51.360]   What is this?
[00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:55.600]   This is an example of AMP stories on Google's blog site.
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:58.520]   God, that means my email game is going to...
[00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:02.200]   The nice thing about having an email newsletter is you can just give people text.
[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:04.400]   That is very hard.
[00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:09.120]   You got animation, you got pictures moving, you got all princesses and princesses.
[00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:10.120]   Yeah.
[00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:11.120]   This is People Magazine.
[00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:13.680]   You have romance in your email, Stacy romance.
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:18.640]   I talk about compromised sex stories all the time.
[00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:21.800]   Well, there's an opportunity.
[00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:23.400]   There's an opportunity.
[00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:27.560]   Let's see what Cosmopolitan is doing for AMP stories.
[00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:29.200]   This is Apple Cider Vinegar.
[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:32.800]   Is the magic potion you need in your life?
[00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:34.240]   The blockchain, how about Wired?
[00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.240]   The block chow?
[00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:36.240]   These aren't live.
[00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:37.960]   This is just an image too bad.
[00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:39.960]   I was hoping I could go right to the...
[00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:41.120]   I can't do that.
[00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:43.760]   That's going to force me to up my game tremendously.
[00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:48.160]   By independent publishing self and screw.
[00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:51.840]   It's like making two of them.
[00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:56.240]   But also, is this portrait shape one image a time thing?
[00:09:56.240 --> 00:10:01.240]   And then the desktop version of that is, let's crop your screen down to this big and
[00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:03.840]   put an image in it, which is kind of annoying.
[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:05.880]   Are you okay with this, Kevin?
[00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:06.880]   Cos it's open.
[00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:08.880]   You showed me four frames.
[00:10:08.880 --> 00:10:10.240]   It's open-ish.
[00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:18.240]   I mean, the thing that made me kind of live with AMP is that it degrades to...
[00:10:18.240 --> 00:10:26.120]   If you're not using an AMP enabled tool, it degrades to standard web standards.
[00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:32.520]   The thing I don't like about it is that Google seems to be favoring AMP stories and
[00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:38.520]   AMP articles in its search, which seems to me any competitive.
[00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:40.520]   So I'm not thrilled about that.
[00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:44.400]   Well, now I'm not thrilled either.
[00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:46.400]   You're not thrilled because you're getting competition.
[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:49.240]   Oh, I just have to work harder.
[00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:50.240]   Yeah.
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:51.240]   Yeah.
[00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:52.240]   No, you don't.
[00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:53.240]   You don't have to.
[00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:56.640]   So AMP for email is a spec that will be coming to Gmail later this year.
[00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:57.880]   There's a developer preview.
[00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:01.880]   You have to sign up for it, sign up, but I haven't been offered it.
[00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:04.240]   But it's really not for me.
[00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:08.360]   It's not for any end user to put in their emails for people who are doing email newsletters.
[00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:10.240]   I presume MailChimp would have some...
[00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:11.240]   It's for advertisers.
[00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:17.240]   At some point, MailChimp would have a tool that would make your AMP your stuff.
[00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:22.280]   My blog is AMP because it's on WordPress.com, a sponsor, and it's automatic.
[00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:25.080]   It just gives you an AMP version of it.
[00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:26.880]   All right.
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:30.120]   I just thought I'd bring that up.
[00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:32.320]   I thought there might be more outrage.
[00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:40.120]   Well, the challenge of doing HTML at the moment is you've basically got to make your HTML
[00:11:40.120 --> 00:11:46.040]   compatible with the worst email renderer of HTML, which tends to be Outlook, which is
[00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:50.880]   running some ancient version of the IE renderer that has been abandoned.
[00:11:50.880 --> 00:11:52.560]   It's like IE4 or something.
[00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:54.480]   It is some really old version like that.
[00:11:54.480 --> 00:11:57.560]   And also, the other ones will strip lots of stuff out of it as well.
[00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:00.640]   So you can Gmail will strip a lot of things out of you.
[00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:08.000]   So the way that the guy who runs AMP was pitching this was that it'll give you an up-to-date
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:14.080]   version of HTML that you can put alongside your plaintext and your HTML you have compatible
[00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:16.920]   for retro viewers.
[00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:21.320]   And then you'll be able to do rich stuff for people who can accept it, which is like,
[00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:25.160]   yes, you just maybe do a bunch of extra work to make my stuff appear.
[00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:26.160]   Thanks.
[00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:32.880]   So as long as we're along those lines, Google is also starting to play with introducing
[00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:39.320]   the reply feature that you saw initially in inbox and then an aloe in more messaging
[00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:40.320]   apps.
[00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:43.880]   For instance, I would love to see it in Hangouts and Android Messages.
[00:12:43.880 --> 00:12:44.880]   Here's an example.
[00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:46.880]   Yeah, here's an example.
[00:12:46.880 --> 00:12:50.040]   Yeah, this is an Android Messages Alex.
[00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:51.920]   When can you be home?
[00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:56.800]   And then there's a button to the right that has 13 minutes and a picture of a car.
[00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:58.880]   I presume you press that.
[00:12:58.880 --> 00:12:59.880]   Maybe he sent that.
[00:12:59.880 --> 00:13:02.840]   Here's Gabe, are you at the restaurant and it offers three possible replies?
[00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:03.840]   Yes, yes, I'm here.
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:04.840]   I am indeed.
[00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:05.840]   Nothing about no.
[00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:06.840]   Why is it no?
[00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:08.800]   Maybe because Google knows you are.
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:10.000]   You're there, yes.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   I know.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.880]   Don't give it that much credit because I get those all the time and I love them.
[00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:19.360]   But it'll be like, can we do a meeting on Friday or Thursday and the options are either
[00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:23.800]   works for me, Thursday works for me, or that sounds great.
[00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:25.120]   I don't want to meet you.
[00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:27.320]   I don't ever want to see you again.
[00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:28.320]   Yeah.
[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:29.320]   Yeah.
[00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:34.080]   So this is coming from Area 120, which I was not familiar with, but it's the kind of the
[00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:38.960]   experimental Google stuff, Area 120.Google.com.
[00:13:38.960 --> 00:13:40.520]   Oh, yeah.
[00:13:40.520 --> 00:13:41.520]   Yeah.
[00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:44.400]   It's a workshop for Google's experimental program.
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:45.400]   So I didn't know this.
[00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:46.720]   So I've signed up saying this.
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:50.760]   I'd like to participate, but probably because I would mention it on the show.
[00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:51.760]   They wouldn't let me.
[00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:52.760]   You're not allowed to.
[00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:53.760]   I bet not.
[00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:56.040]   That's the first rule of 120.
[00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:58.600]   One doesn't talk about 120.
[00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:01.440]   All right.
[00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:03.200]   Maybe I would love to see.
[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:04.360]   So I'm unclear.
[00:14:04.360 --> 00:14:09.600]   This is a story from Android police that says they're going to make it an app.
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:11.840]   Reply as an app.
[00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:14.120]   So another chat app.
[00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:15.360]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:22.560]   No, it puts the app, the app puts the reply into the notifications.
[00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:25.320]   So it modifies, you know, the smart notifications.
[00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:26.320]   Right.
[00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:30.240]   Then that means you got one back and forth and then the continuing conversation is not
[00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:32.920]   going to help with Google has to be.
[00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:34.160]   They should build it into you.
[00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:35.160]   I agree with you.
[00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:36.160]   They should build into the app.
[00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:37.160]   Yeah.
[00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:39.760]   And the other report out there is that Google's going to finally let you text from the web.
[00:14:39.760 --> 00:14:45.120]   If they could unify all this chat stuff together and add that functionality, they'd finally
[00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:47.200]   catch up to and buy an HP dapple.
[00:14:47.200 --> 00:14:48.200]   Yeah.
[00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:52.680]   This was in a early, somebody was analyzing the source code of Android messages.
[00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:57.360]   Of course, you can text from the web now with Hangouts, but Android messages you cannot.
[00:14:57.360 --> 00:15:05.200]   And that if you can parse Google's confusing messaging about its messages, is there what
[00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:06.720]   they want people to start using?
[00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:11.320]   Because it has RCS, Google's messages, has RCS in it.
[00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:15.600]   But I just keep using, I'm a Google Fire user and Hangouts is the only way that I can do
[00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:22.000]   everything I want, which is get text messages to all my phones and enabled phones and from
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:23.840]   the web, which I really like.
[00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:28.000]   Frankly, the functionality of Hangouts remain, at least for Google Fire users remains very
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   good.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:32.360]   I'm just waiting for them to pull a plug on that.
[00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:36.720]   Do any of you use Hangouts with just a non-Fi phone with like a T-Mobile phone or anything?
[00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:38.280]   Does it not work okay?
[00:15:38.280 --> 00:15:39.280]   It's all right.
[00:15:39.280 --> 00:15:40.280]   Yeah.
[00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:43.880]   Aren't you supposed to, didn't they say they were going to take SMS out of it?
[00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:45.360]   I don't use it with SMS.
[00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:46.360]   Oh, you can.
[00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:47.840]   I use it, yeah, because I can't.
[00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:52.840]   They use to, but I use it a lot because why do I use it?
[00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:55.840]   Because Kevin is on it because my daughter and Andrew are on it.
[00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:59.280]   So the people I talk to most prefer that as their method of communication.
[00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:00.280]   Right.
[00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:04.280]   And if you're a file user, it really is exactly what you want in messages, but only if you're
[00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:07.040]   because I can use, I can still use SMS with it.
[00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:14.640]   So it is my SMS client and my data messaging client.
[00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:19.760]   And I'm much more responsive on Hangouts because those are the people I like as opposed to
[00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:20.760]   the people who text me.
[00:16:20.760 --> 00:16:23.600]   I'll have to remember to add you to Hangouts.
[00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:26.040]   I may not accept your invitation later.
[00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:27.240]   Oh, probably not.
[00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:30.120]   So if I, so that is another thing that's confusing.
[00:16:30.120 --> 00:16:36.880]   So if I create a Hangouts message, I could create it to you as a conversation they call
[00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:39.760]   it, which is data only or as a text message.
[00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:42.160]   Oh, see, I can only do conversations.
[00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:43.760]   Yeah, as an SMS.
[00:16:43.760 --> 00:16:44.960]   So that's nice.
[00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:48.000]   That's a nice feature.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.880]   But you would, but if I did, I wonder what would happen.
[00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:55.680]   I guess if I did that to you as SMS, then you would get it as an SMS message, but it wouldn't
[00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:57.240]   start a Hangouts conversation.
[00:16:57.240 --> 00:17:03.720]   So it would, if ideally you would know which is the right way to do it with all the people
[00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:05.200]   you message with and you do it.
[00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:06.640]   Oh, it's just what I'm.
[00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:07.640]   Thank you, Google for nothing.
[00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:10.120]   Well, thank you for the whole ecosystem.
[00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:11.120]   This whole text.
[00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:13.080]   I mean, texting was the easiest thing out there.
[00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:15.240]   And it's just become how did it get so complicated?
[00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:16.240]   Yeah.
[00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:18.240]   I blame gifts.
[00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:21.200]   Well, yeah, gifts don't work on an SMS.
[00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:22.360]   Only text works on SMS.
[00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:23.720]   Kevin, do you have an answer to this?
[00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:24.720]   Kevin seems like Kevin.
[00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:25.720]   This is your beat.
[00:17:25.720 --> 00:17:27.960]   This is the kind of thing you would follow is like, why?
[00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:32.600]   Stuff doesn't work because of their stupid closed platforms.
[00:17:32.600 --> 00:17:33.600]   Yes.
[00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:34.600]   Yeah.
[00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:36.600]   Well, no, the problem.
[00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:39.240]   The irony here is it's an open platform.
[00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:42.720]   SMS is, well, an open-ish platform, which means that everyone can implement it, which
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:46.640]   means you end up with five implementations on your phone that fight over it.
[00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:52.800]   So, you know, Facebook and Google and Apple and whoever else all want to be your SMS client.
[00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:55.520]   And Google wants, has three separate groups who want to be a SMS client because that's
[00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:57.320]   the way Google is.
[00:17:57.320 --> 00:18:02.320]   So your Android, it's like, I've got an SMS who's going to receive it, I'm not sure.
[00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:04.800]   Everyone's in a while.
[00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:05.800]   Right.
[00:18:05.800 --> 00:18:15.160]   But both Messenger and I think at least one of the other Facebook ones will receive SMS
[00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:16.760]   is WhatsApp will do it as well, I think.
[00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:20.520]   On Android, yeah, you can, you can choose an effect signal messenger.
[00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:23.040]   You can choose.
[00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:30.080]   But then I lose my desktop capability and I'm not sure what happens when I, because I have,
[00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:34.680]   so this is a Google phi phone, but I also want to get the same text messages on my iPhone,
[00:18:34.680 --> 00:18:36.960]   which is not obviously Google phi.
[00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:38.040]   So hangouts will do that.
[00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:39.600]   I have to run Hangouts.
[00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:43.080]   It's not my text messenger on my iPhone, but I run it so I can see those.
[00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:47.400]   And then I can also do it on the desktop because my Google Chrome has the Hangouts plugin.
[00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:52.560]   So Hangouts is the most universal choice for me, for a Google phi user.
[00:18:52.560 --> 00:19:00.320]   But as soon as I switch to signal or WhatsApp or Facebook messenger, I lose all of that capability.
[00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:01.960]   So that doesn't work well.
[00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:06.520]   Anyway, reply, which will come out sometime in the future, may even be a separate app,
[00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:10.920]   but it may even be part of the new Google Gboard keyboard.
[00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:18.760]   It will add Hangouts, Aloe, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Android messages, Skype, Twitter
[00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:21.920]   direct messages and Slack.
[00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:23.920]   Google add a vacation responder.
[00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:26.680]   Oh no, I hate those.
[00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:32.720]   Yeah, do not disturb, which is a very nice feature I already have on the iPhone.
[00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:36.000]   And some apps, I guess Android car does that also.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:40.360]   And then when you get an urgent message like we're waiting for you, reply can make sure
[00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:44.800]   to get your attention, even if your phone is silent.
[00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:50.960]   So reply is obviously AI built into your message notifications.
[00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:52.680]   I would like to not miss important texts.
[00:19:52.680 --> 00:19:55.880]   Yeah, I don't know what the keywords are there, but...
[00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:59.560]   Well, you know, it would be really interesting because the reason I miss texts is because
[00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:01.560]   my phone is somewhere else.
[00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:08.200]   I would love for it to tie into my home or one of my other devices and be like, "Yo,
[00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:10.600]   grab your phone."
[00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:11.600]   So this is...
[00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:15.120]   Was Gacy, it'll do Morris code for the lights of the house and then she'll get it that way.
[00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:16.120]   Yeah.
[00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:19.880]   Okay, you can laugh, but I used to have my lights turn red when my editor texted me.
[00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:21.520]   His phone number texts me.
[00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:23.240]   That's a good idea.
[00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:25.200]   Only for important stories.
[00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:30.760]   And if I was not at my desk, my lights would turn red and I'd be like, "Holy crap, breaking
[00:20:30.760 --> 00:20:31.760]   news.
[00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:32.760]   Go, go, go."
[00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:37.920]   Gacy, can you look to your left?
[00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:39.280]   Are you wearing a blue ear muff?
[00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:41.040]   Oh, that's just your hair.
[00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:42.280]   Oh, yeah, sorry.
[00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:43.760]   That's my hair.
[00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:47.320]   It looks like you have one blue ear muff.
[00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:49.400]   Oh, now it's all right because you showed your hair.
[00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:51.160]   It's like you had one blue ear muff on your right ear.
[00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:53.320]   You were getting used to Stacey as a half blonde.
[00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:55.920]   Yeah, I'm very confused by Stacey's hair color.
[00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:56.920]   She's...
[00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:57.920]   Sorry.
[00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:01.400]   I don't know what pronoun to use now.
[00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:05.280]   So yeah, I look forward to this smart reply thing.
[00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:11.360]   It works in other's apps besides Android or not Google apps.
[00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:17.600]   So Ronamadio has a nice write up in ours, Technica as well.
[00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:19.600]   So I guess he got invited.
[00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:20.760]   I don't know, I'm waiting for my invite.
[00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:26.320]   I'd really like to try this, but you tell me that I can't do it because...
[00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:27.320]   There was an ampe...
[00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:28.320]   I was invited.
[00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:31.320]   There was evidently an ampe day before the Google D and I think today I'm interested
[00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:32.320]   in it, but I didn't...
[00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:33.320]   Ampe day?
[00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:34.320]   No, I didn't know.
[00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:36.320]   It sounds like a party, ampe day.
[00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:40.320]   Yeah, I got an ampe day.
[00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:44.760]   The reply app, according to Ronamadio, will do something along the same lines as Android
[00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:49.760]   where it'll grab all the text and images from your messaging notifications through...
[00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:54.400]   There's an API for the notification listener and then takes those notifications, rebuilds
[00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:55.400]   them.
[00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:56.400]   Wow.
[00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:59.960]   Just as a watch might do.
[00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:05.480]   And it does it so it can slipstream the smart reply options into the notification panels.
[00:22:05.480 --> 00:22:06.480]   Interesting.
[00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:12.680]   And it will block them the original notification so that you don't get duplicates.
[00:22:12.680 --> 00:22:17.880]   Yeah, I think that's a very interesting way to do it.
[00:22:17.880 --> 00:22:20.000]   Well, we'll find out.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:25.280]   I mean, Ron's somehow Ron got in the Early Access program.
[00:22:25.280 --> 00:22:28.440]   Maybe I'll get an invite someday.
[00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:30.560]   All right.
[00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:33.320]   Moving right along.
[00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:35.080]   Tomorrow.
[00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:41.040]   Chrome gets an ad blocker.
[00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:42.800]   Are you ready for this?
[00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:44.600]   I am excited.
[00:22:44.600 --> 00:22:45.600]   A bad ad blocker.
[00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:49.360]   Not an old ad blocker, but a bad ad.
[00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:50.800]   It's a start.
[00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:54.480]   Yeah, so this is what they're saying.
[00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:59.240]   Yeah, it's not as good as say adblock plus or my preferred ad blocker, you block origin.
[00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:00.960]   It's better for the media industry.
[00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:06.160]   Well, I think it's kind of maybe it's like kind of a good compromise.
[00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:12.880]   So it'll only block ads that don't conform to the coalition for better ads guidelines.
[00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:21.760]   But if even one ad on a site goes against that guideline, it'll block all the ads.
[00:23:21.760 --> 00:23:23.080]   So until when?
[00:23:23.080 --> 00:23:29.040]   I mean, what if what if you well, if they fix it, I guess it'll pop up ads, prestitial
[00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:30.200]   ads with a countdown.
[00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:31.680]   I hate those.
[00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:36.680]   Autoplay video ads with sound large.
[00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:39.160]   Yeah, you know, Forbes does that, right?
[00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:42.200]   You have to watch an ad before you can get to the site.
[00:23:42.200 --> 00:23:43.640]   A lot of sites do that.
[00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:46.000]   Wired has started doing that, I think.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.520]   Large sticky ads.
[00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:49.400]   That's on desktop on mobile.
[00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:53.480]   It'll block pop up ads, prestitial ads, autoplay video ads with sound, prestitial ads with
[00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:59.000]   a countdown, but also any page with an ad density more than 30%.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.920]   Washing animated ads, large sticky ads.
[00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:06.720]   I hate it when ads are sticky and full screen scroll over ads.
[00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:10.040]   That's the worst on mobile where you have to kind of as you're scrolling the page, the
[00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:14.360]   ad comes up and you have to keep scrolling as the ad goes by as you can continue to read.
[00:24:14.360 --> 00:24:16.480]   The worst.
[00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:23.280]   It's using the easy list filter rules, which are kind of public and open and community
[00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:25.600]   curated.
[00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:28.560]   By the way, Google's own ad networks are not exempt.
[00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:33.720]   If the ad in violation comes from ad sensor double click, it'll be blocked.
[00:24:33.720 --> 00:24:34.720]   This is according to...
[00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:40.760]   But they're not blocking ads that mine cryptocurrencies in your browser.
[00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:41.960]   Oh, that's not good.
[00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:42.960]   They will block in.
[00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:44.120]   Those will be good.
[00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:46.320]   So you know who's doing that now, which is kind of...
[00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:48.040]   So there's of course a bunch of bad...
[00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:49.040]   Yes, yes.
[00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:50.040]   Yes, on.
[00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:51.040]   Yes, on.
[00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:52.240]   There's the coin hive is the company that's doing this.
[00:24:52.240 --> 00:24:53.240]   It's not Bitcoin.
[00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:55.240]   They're not mining Monero.
[00:24:55.240 --> 00:25:01.120]   And interestingly, one of the companies doing this now is Slate, although here I am with
[00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:02.920]   my ad blocker on.
[00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:04.160]   I think it's Salon, isn't it?
[00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:05.160]   Did I say Slate Salon?
[00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:06.160]   Salon.
[00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:07.160]   Yeah, it's funny.
[00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:12.160]   It's the 12,786 business model attempt by Salon.
[00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:13.360]   Yeah, here it is.
[00:25:13.360 --> 00:25:15.240]   Wasn't Salon started by Microsoft?
[00:25:15.240 --> 00:25:16.320]   Is that the one started by Microsoft?
[00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:18.320]   No, Slate was started by Microsoft.
[00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:20.760]   Salon was started by the former examiner guy.
[00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:21.760]   San Francisco.
[00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:22.760]   Yeah.
[00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:23.760]   It was SF America.
[00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:24.760]   Yeah.
[00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:25.760]   So we've noticed...
[00:25:25.760 --> 00:25:26.760]   We're going to go stop.
[00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:27.760]   There it is.
[00:25:27.760 --> 00:25:28.760]   Here it is.
[00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:29.760]   We've noticed you're using an ad blocker.
[00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:32.280]   We depend on ads to keep your content free for you.
[00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:34.040]   Please consider disabling your blocker.
[00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:35.040]   We've seen these before.
[00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:37.280]   By the way, you can...
[00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:42.040]   It's an escalating war because you block origin, which allows me to set a thing that
[00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:45.400]   disables the ad blocker disabling message.
[00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:48.200]   The ad blocker blocker.
[00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:53.560]   So I can either click OK, I've disabled it, or in beta, suppress ads.
[00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:59.720]   Block ads by allowing Salon to use your unused computing power.
[00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:04.600]   They don't give you a whole lot of detail, but if you click Learn More, immediately it
[00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:07.720]   will start mining, I'm told.
[00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:11.360]   So it's mining now, I guess.
[00:26:11.360 --> 00:26:12.680]   And they don't really...
[00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:16.960]   They talk about ads and how ads is undermining journalism.
[00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:18.880]   Blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:21.160]   But they don't really say when you say Learn More.
[00:26:21.160 --> 00:26:25.640]   They don't really say exactly what they're doing.
[00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:27.360]   That's not cool.
[00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:29.720]   How does Salon make money using my processing power?
[00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:32.440]   The demand for computing power, blah, blah, blah.
[00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:36.760]   We tend to use a percentage of your spare processing power to contribute to the advancement
[00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:40.560]   of technological discovery, evolution, and innovation.
[00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:41.560]   What?
[00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:43.640]   No.
[00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:47.800]   But for now, for our beta program, we'll start by applying your processing power to mine
[00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:50.960]   cryptocurrencies to recoup lost ad revenue.
[00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:56.840]   So in other words, this whole thing about contributing to the advancement of technological discovery,
[00:26:56.840 --> 00:26:57.840]   evolution, and innovation.
[00:26:57.840 --> 00:26:59.080]   And never mind.
[00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:01.120]   We're going to do mine cryptocurrencies.
[00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:04.720]   We plan to further use any learnings from this to help support the evolution and growth
[00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:06.960]   of blockchain technology.
[00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:10.440]   Digital currencies and otherwise to better service the value exchange between the content
[00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:11.440]   and user contribution.
[00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:15.880]   I'm not against this idea, except that we've seen these already.
[00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:19.800]   We've seen these JavaScript-based crypto mining programs abuse.
[00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:23.320]   Some of them stay on the machine even after you leave the site.
[00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:24.800]   So I think it's a little...
[00:27:24.800 --> 00:27:26.720]   What are my off-the-road students doing?
[00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:28.720]   Working on a business along this.
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:29.880]   I won't give it away.
[00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:34.720]   But when he gets ready to say it publicly, I think it'll be much more helpful and at
[00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:36.520]   a higher standard for publishers.
[00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:37.520]   Yeah.
[00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:40.680]   I'm not in principle against the idea of it doing this, as long as it doesn't peg my
[00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:41.680]   processor.
[00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:42.680]   It stops.
[00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:43.680]   It stops.
[00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:44.680]   Yeah.
[00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:47.320]   And as long as it stops when I leave...
[00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:48.480]   Or when you have the...
[00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:49.480]   Go into a rough...
[00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:50.480]   Kevin, were you strained?
[00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:51.480]   I'm not sure.
[00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:52.480]   Did you just...
[00:27:52.480 --> 00:27:53.480]   Story this weekend?
[00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:55.480]   No, what's the story?
[00:27:55.480 --> 00:27:59.440]   I just put it in the chat.
[00:27:59.440 --> 00:28:04.880]   Somebody took over a library that lots of sites were using called Brown House Lab,
[00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:10.320]   other words, Visibility Library, and they injected the Coin Hive Mining Code into it.
[00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:14.080]   Which meant that suddenly lots of government websites in the UK and Australia were mining
[00:28:14.080 --> 00:28:15.080]   crypto companies.
[00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:16.280]   Well, yes.
[00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:19.600]   And YouTube ads, and there's lots of places.
[00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:20.600]   So this is already...
[00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:27.800]   Yeah, this Coin Hive Monero miner has already kind of been tarnished by these 4,200 websites
[00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:32.600]   were affected by browse allowed.
[00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:34.240]   Including uscourts.gov.
[00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:36.240]   Oh, Jeff.
[00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:37.240]   CUNY.edu.
[00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:38.240]   Oh, no.
[00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:44.680]   The UK Student Loans Company.
[00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:49.080]   We forgot we had talked about this yesterday on security now.
[00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:51.880]   The UK Information Commissioner?
[00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:58.240]   Manchester.gov.uk/nhsinformed.scottagriculture.gov.ie.
[00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:00.960]   That's the Irish Department of Agriculture.
[00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:04.160]   Croydon.gov.uk a lot of these.
[00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:06.440]   So they were using browse allowed, which was a legitimate...
[00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:07.960]   You know, as a legitimate...
[00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:12.080]   Or was considered a legitimate...
[00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:16.920]   It was an accessibility feature to read the text out loud.
[00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:17.920]   Was this...
[00:29:17.920 --> 00:29:18.920]   Right.
[00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:22.360]   Is this browse allowed that did it or was it a hack?
[00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:23.920]   Browse allowed was compromised.
[00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:24.920]   Compromised, okay.
[00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:26.400]   Browse allowed was compromised.
[00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:31.080]   Because they were embedding something that didn't...
[00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:35.400]   That wasn't versioned and wasn't hashed, they could just change the code in it.
[00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:39.040]   This is really a huge weakness in general.
[00:29:39.040 --> 00:29:42.800]   You know, you're running JavaScript, you're running code in the browser.
[00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:45.960]   The code can be...
[00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:52.120]   Do all sorts of things, including crypto mining.
[00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:54.680]   And yeah.
[00:29:54.680 --> 00:29:58.720]   So presumably they're fixing this.
[00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:00.280]   Not CUNY's fault.
[00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:06.320]   CUNY was doing the right thing by putting a text reader on their sites to make it accessible.
[00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:08.520]   Which we have to do by law.
[00:30:08.520 --> 00:30:09.520]   Right.
[00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:11.680]   So that was a big browse allowed.
[00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:17.600]   I've said, oh, insert this and you will fulfil these mandates to be accessible.
[00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:20.920]   And so that's why it was proportionally governed by the sites that did it.
[00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:26.920]   Because they tend to follow those mandates.
[00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:31.120]   So back to the ad blocker in Chrome.
[00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:33.080]   It will not block that.
[00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:34.880]   For now.
[00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:42.000]   Correct me if I'm wrong, but I thought you add block plus, that's what adblock plus was
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:49.040]   blocking was the ads that were not approved by Coalition for Better Ads.
[00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:51.040]   I know.
[00:30:51.040 --> 00:30:56.160]   Well, I know some recent version for it with blocking those ads that were paid for.
[00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:57.160]   Right.
[00:30:57.160 --> 00:31:00.720]   Well, but that was paid for by...
[00:31:00.720 --> 00:31:02.720]   Pay off adblock.
[00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:03.720]   Yeah.
[00:31:03.720 --> 00:31:04.720]   Yeah.
[00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:10.400]   Anyway, I use UBlock Origin which is free and does not have that kind of fishy relationship
[00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:11.400]   with that size.
[00:31:11.400 --> 00:31:12.400]   I know.
[00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:13.400]   I know.
[00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:14.400]   I know.
[00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:15.400]   I don't want to.
[00:31:15.400 --> 00:31:16.400]   But there's...
[00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:19.080]   I hope the Chrome one gets rid of the irritating ones and lets the decent ones in.
[00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:21.040]   It's not, to me, it's not the ads that I'm blocking.
[00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:27.680]   I'm blocking the security issues of things like that Coin Hive mining code.
[00:31:27.680 --> 00:31:29.680]   The tracking, tracking doesn't bother me either.
[00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:33.320]   It's mostly security and frankly the weight of sites.
[00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:34.320]   Yeah.
[00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:36.320]   That's what I'm doing.
[00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:37.920]   The bandwidth's consumed.
[00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:41.800]   Yeah.
[00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:43.080]   So Google, well, we'll see.
[00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:44.400]   Tomorrow it happens.
[00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:46.040]   That really is the ad apocalypse.
[00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:50.640]   Everybody said when Apple put that into Safari on iOS that that was going to be the ad apocalypse.
[00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:53.320]   So now Chrome is the dominant blazer.
[00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:54.640]   And this is not just on mobile.
[00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:57.120]   This is on desktop as well.
[00:31:57.120 --> 00:31:59.680]   Then also, I'll put another thing on the rundown that Google was...
[00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:03.440]   I think this is programmatic retargeting advertising.
[00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:05.120]   They called it reminder ads.
[00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:07.520]   Oh, you looked at these boots on Amazon.
[00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:09.480]   We're going to bug you about them for six months.
[00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:12.720]   I don't know if that's the same thing, but I think that Google's report is that Google's
[00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:15.720]   looking at making you able to block those as well.
[00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:18.000]   Well, you know, sometimes I like those.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:22.360]   Like I might look at something on Nordstrom and then eventually I find out that it's on
[00:32:22.360 --> 00:32:25.200]   sale through a retargeting ad and then I'm like, "Oh, buy them."
[00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:26.680]   Well, you don't have to turn it on.
[00:32:26.680 --> 00:32:27.680]   This is a setting.
[00:32:27.680 --> 00:32:28.680]   You don't have to turn it off.
[00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:31.880]   I do because I cannot handle any more auto play ads.
[00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:32.880]   Good Lord.
[00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:34.920]   Well, this is in your Google ads.
[00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:35.920]   This is separate.
[00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:40.200]   This would be in the Google ad settings on your phone.
[00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:42.000]   So Google's doing these reminder ads.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.800]   I mean, this is their Google ad network.
[00:32:43.800 --> 00:32:44.800]   Everybody is.
[00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:45.800]   Yeah.
[00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:46.800]   Yeah.
[00:32:46.800 --> 00:32:47.800]   I've never heard them called reminder ads.
[00:32:47.800 --> 00:32:52.080]   They're the jargon they were called retarded.
[00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:53.560]   Just reminding you.
[00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:55.040]   Just reminding you.
[00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:58.840]   But actually what's interesting is it will show you which reminder ads you're actually
[00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:00.280]   Stacy, you might like this.
[00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:04.200]   It's pretty granular because it'll say, "Here's a reminder ads you can say from this one
[00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:05.440]   okay but not from this one."
[00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:06.440]   Oh, nice.
[00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:07.440]   Okay.
[00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:09.600]   Well, the issue also is I bought that thing already.
[00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:10.600]   Yeah.
[00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:11.600]   But you don't have to.
[00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:12.760]   You could just check that box off.
[00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:14.680]   You don't bother me DIY Plaza.
[00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:16.880]   I'm never going to do it myself.
[00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:20.400]   The advertiser would get better information to say, "Oh, yeah, you're one of ours.
[00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:21.400]   We're going to stop looking.
[00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:22.640]   You because you actually bought our product."
[00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:23.640]   Thank you very much.
[00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:27.880]   This tool allows users to view all the reminder ads currently tracked to your profile from
[00:33:27.880 --> 00:33:32.000]   one of over two million sites that use Google's advertising services.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:36.160]   Users can then choose to mute individual reminder ads and view those that they've already muted
[00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:37.160]   with their ad settings.
[00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:39.680]   Oh my God, you guys.
[00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:41.200]   That sounds handy actually.
[00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:42.200]   Yeah.
[00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:44.800]   And it's actually a win-win because you're right.
[00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:46.720]   Advertisers get some benefit, right?
[00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:48.480]   They know Stacy now or not?
[00:33:48.480 --> 00:33:50.080]   Because they know that.
[00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:51.440]   Yeah, you don't want to be reminded.
[00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:53.880]   They know that you've actually bought the thing, which is the classic one.
[00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:57.240]   It's like, "Yes, I've already bought that already."
[00:33:57.240 --> 00:34:00.840]   Muting only lasts for 90 days.
[00:34:00.840 --> 00:34:02.440]   Oh, okay.
[00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:03.720]   I'm sorry, you guys.
[00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:09.240]   There is the most adorable little boy carrying a stuffed animal coming up my back patio and
[00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:10.240]   I can see it.
[00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:11.240]   Do you know him?
[00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:12.240]   I do.
[00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:13.240]   Oh, okay.
[00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:14.400]   It's not a strange little boy.
[00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:16.080]   No, he's so adorable.
[00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:19.560]   He came up and then he just ran away and I don't know what's happening.
[00:34:19.560 --> 00:34:23.520]   If you had a ring video doorbell, you could save that video for posterity.
[00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:25.480]   He didn't make it all the way up to the doorbell.
[00:34:25.480 --> 00:34:27.680]   Well, it still would see him anyway.
[00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:29.480]   Is he a boy or daughter's age?
[00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:30.480]   Is that what you're saying?
[00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:32.320]   Yes, he's my daughter's boyfriend.
[00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:33.320]   Is he a suitor?
[00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:37.080]   Let me tell her that he's running around via text.
[00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:38.080]   Yeah, okay.
[00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:39.080]   Yeah, go tell her.
[00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:41.080]   She want to run out and kiss him.
[00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:42.080]   Then run away.
[00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:43.080]   She's not going to run out.
[00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:44.080]   Kiss him.
[00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:45.080]   Then run away.
[00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:46.080]   Just on the cheek.
[00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:47.080]   Run away.
[00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:49.280]   Turn bright red.
[00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:50.280]   Those were the days.
[00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:54.200]   Oh, you guys, maybe I'll have to leave to go supervise them.
[00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:55.520]   That just occurred to me.
[00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:57.480]   No, just here's the deal.
[00:34:57.480 --> 00:34:59.680]   One foot on the ground all the time, door has to stay open.
[00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:01.480]   That's all simple.
[00:35:01.480 --> 00:35:04.480]   And sitting in a room with one of Bobby's many cameras.
[00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:11.280]   Just say, just remember, mommy has IOT devices everywhere.
[00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:12.280]   Everywhere.
[00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:13.280]   I do.
[00:35:13.280 --> 00:35:15.880]   Apparently he's made it indoors.
[00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:18.040]   So I'm not sure.
[00:35:18.040 --> 00:35:20.720]   I think it's cute that he's carrying a stuffed animal, right?
[00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:21.720]   Is that his...
[00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:23.480]   You think that's a Valentine's gift for her?
[00:35:23.480 --> 00:35:25.360]   Of course it's a Valentine's Day gift.
[00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:26.360]   Oh my God.
[00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:28.280]   Oh, look at the Stacy.
[00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:29.280]   It's begun.
[00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:31.880]   It can't believe I missed you.
[00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:34.400]   Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:36.000]   We'll take care of it.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   Go.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   Oh.
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   Oh, get a picture.
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:40.560]   Lee, you can get a hat.
[00:35:40.560 --> 00:35:43.000]   Like, go to an ad.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   Stay tuned as we find out what's happening between Stacy's daughter.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:53.400]   And this strange boy as the world turns.
[00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:56.840]   But first a word from FreshBooks.
[00:35:56.840 --> 00:35:58.120]   Aya, did you know that?
[00:35:58.120 --> 00:35:59.120]   I didn't know this.
[00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:00.120]   The great stat.
[00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:04.320]   44 million people in the US have a second job.
[00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:05.880]   Sometimes we have to, right?
[00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:09.600]   But the side hustle can also be the thing you really love and you want to do more of,
[00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:10.600]   right?
[00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:14.440]   Maybe it's a passion project, a little extra income.
[00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:18.800]   If you're doing that, I want you to keep you on the right track and I want to do it the
[00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:22.760]   easy way with FreshBooks Cloud Accounting software.
[00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:23.760]   Love FreshBooks.
[00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:29.040]   If you have a business where you have to invoice people, FreshBooks will give you the invoicing,
[00:36:29.040 --> 00:36:30.320]   makes it very easy to do.
[00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:35.360]   But you also get all of this additional benefit because it turns out in the process of doing
[00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:40.320]   this and keeping track of your expenses and outstanding invoices, paid invoices, you're
[00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:43.120]   actually doing accounting without even knowing it.
[00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:47.120]   Their intuitive dashboard gives you quick access to all the information that you would
[00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:52.240]   need spending, outstanding balances, total profit, and other accounting reports.
[00:36:52.240 --> 00:36:55.640]   You'll know how you're doing at any given moment and next month, tax time, you'll be
[00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:57.120]   ahead of the game.
[00:36:57.120 --> 00:36:59.080]   Well, you will if you do it now.
[00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:02.720]   Now, if you do it now, you'll be ready for next year's tax time.
[00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:06.040]   With FreshBooks, as always, you can send professional looking invoices in seconds and
[00:37:06.040 --> 00:37:10.960]   those invoices let you take credit card payment directly from the invoice, which means your
[00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:16.640]   clients will pay you on average twice as fast, twice as fast.
[00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:20.160]   No more waiting in line at the bank to deposit checks, no more chasing clients.
[00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:24.640]   Clients actually like it, that they clear their desk, just respond to the invoice with
[00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:27.520]   a, "Yeah, here, here's the money."
[00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:29.920]   And they get points or whatever, they love it.
[00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:30.920]   It's amazing.
[00:37:30.920 --> 00:37:34.480]   FreshBooks is always adding new features to like their, now you can create proposals
[00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:38.920]   on, right on FreshBooks with rich text, content and images and customizable sections.
[00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:43.360]   You can track, if you build by time, you can track hours, you can have different fees
[00:37:43.360 --> 00:37:45.440]   for different services.
[00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:50.040]   FreshBooks automatically connects to your bank account and updates your expenses daily.
[00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:52.040]   In fact, it's really easy to get expenses in.
[00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:56.000]   You just take a picture of the receipt, upload it and FreshBooks does the rest.
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:00.760]   From payment reminders to late fees, automate as much or as little as you'd like to so you
[00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:03.040]   can get back to doing what your love.
[00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:06.280]   Make this year your most productive year yet.
[00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:11.360]   FreshBooks you'll be ready when tax time comes along and you'll be set up for success
[00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:15.200]   when you decide to turn your passion project into a full time gig.
[00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:16.200]   That's what I did.
[00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:18.480]   It is what I did.

[00:38:25.600 --> 00:38:29.200]   Don't forget to put this week in Google when they ask you, "How'd you hear about us right
[00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:30.200]   in the form there?"
[00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:35.880]   This week in Google, freshbooks.com/twig.
[00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:40.040]   It's true love blossoming in the Higgin' Botham household.
[00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:41.120]   It was so cute.
[00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:43.080]   He was actually trying to be sneaky.
[00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:46.480]   The dog and my cameras spoiled him.
[00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:48.280]   The cameras did.
[00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:51.200]   Well, he knew we had some cameras.
[00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:53.080]   He was trying to figure out where they were.
[00:38:53.080 --> 00:38:54.080]   What grade are they in?
[00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:55.080]   Six grade?
[00:38:55.080 --> 00:38:56.080]   Oh, yeah.
[00:38:56.080 --> 00:38:57.480]   That's exactly when it starts.
[00:38:57.480 --> 00:38:58.480]   Yeah.
[00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:00.880]   Oh, that's so cute.
[00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:03.880]   Oh my gosh.
[00:39:03.880 --> 00:39:06.160]   That's a special moment.
[00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:07.160]   For her, yes.
[00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:08.160]   Yeah.
[00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:09.160]   Well, for you too.
[00:39:09.160 --> 00:39:10.160]   It's for mom too.
[00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:11.800]   Oh, I'm like, "Oh."
[00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:13.360]   It's kind of a mixed feeling, right?
[00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:15.440]   It's like my little baby is growing up.
[00:39:15.440 --> 00:39:18.000]   No, this little boy is the sweetest little boy.
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   Yeah, good.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   Oh my goodness.
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   No tats or anything.
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   No tats.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:23.000]   Not yet.
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   I'm waiting.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.240]   All right, I don't know what to say about this.
[00:39:27.240 --> 00:39:33.080]   I have to say, I guess this is a good thing, but it kind of irks me.
[00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:38.840]   Global Chromium has announced the beginning July 18th, the release of Chrome 68.
[00:39:38.840 --> 00:39:44.720]   If your site is not HTTPS, it will be labeled not secure.
[00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:48.640]   Now, of course, a Twitter's HTTPS.
[00:39:48.640 --> 00:39:51.320]   My blog is HTTPS, but I do have a site.
[00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:53.720]   The radio show site was designed a few years ago.
[00:39:53.720 --> 00:39:55.560]   There's a lot of historic sites that are--
[00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:57.240]   A lot of sites are not HTTPS.
[00:39:57.240 --> 00:39:58.720]   There's no accounts on that site.
[00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:00.320]   There's no login.
[00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:01.560]   You're not buying anything.
[00:40:01.560 --> 00:40:02.920]   It's a free wide open site.
[00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:03.920]   I don't know.
[00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:04.920]   [BEEP]
[00:40:04.920 --> 00:40:05.920]   Uh-oh.
[00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:06.920]   What's happening?
[00:40:06.920 --> 00:40:09.640]   I think room service is here.
[00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:10.640]   I don't know.
[00:40:10.640 --> 00:40:12.200]   I don't know what happened.
[00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:14.680]   We're just chock full of distractions today.
[00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:22.520]   Anyway, at the same time, having HTTPS everywhere protects everybody, there isn't any longer
[00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:24.360]   a performance hit.
[00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:27.040]   Modern machines are so fast, that's not a problem.
[00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:32.640]   There is always, even with a site like the radio show website where there's no login
[00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:35.520]   or anything, there's always the risk of a man in the middle.
[00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:36.520]   Somebody pop it.
[00:40:36.520 --> 00:40:37.680]   You're at a coffee shop.
[00:40:37.680 --> 00:40:39.920]   You're visiting the tech guy lab site.
[00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:43.320]   Somebody puts a pop up saying, "Hey, thanks for visiting Leo.
[00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:47.960]   Would you like the complete collection of Leo CDs for only $9.95?
[00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:49.960]   Just fill in your credit card information, except it's not me.
[00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:51.120]   I don't sell it."
[00:40:51.120 --> 00:40:52.120]   And somebody's stealing it.
[00:40:52.120 --> 00:40:57.640]   So there's always that risk and HTTPS protects you somewhat.
[00:40:57.640 --> 00:40:59.240]   Let me ask Kevin.
[00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:02.880]   Is this a good thing?
[00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:06.720]   It's a trade-off because there's still a lot of extra overhead selling up an HTTPS
[00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:07.720]   site.
[00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:08.920]   It's going to be expensive for me.
[00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:12.960]   It's not merely the getting the certificate, which is expensive enough.
[00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:13.960]   Really?
[00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:14.960]   That makes you close.
[00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:16.120]   Well, it depends what you get.
[00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:18.920]   If you get an extended cert, it's much more expensive.
[00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:22.200]   I don't know if we'd have to get a wild card cert for tech guy labs, but those are thousands
[00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:23.360]   of dollars.
[00:41:23.360 --> 00:41:24.360]   But that's not the end of it.
[00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:25.360]   The site was not designed for me.
[00:41:25.360 --> 00:41:27.640]   You can get one per sub domain.
[00:41:27.640 --> 00:41:33.120]   Yeah, we have a wild card cert for Twit.tv.
[00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:34.120]   We just renewed it.
[00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:35.120]   It was very quick.
[00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:38.760]   What if you're first Baptist Church?
[00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:39.760]   Right.
[00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:42.120]   And you have a super little site just when the service is wrong.
[00:41:42.120 --> 00:41:46.200]   Well, I'm going to have to-- I don't know how much it's going to cost to add secure HTTP
[00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:50.280]   to my site, but it's not something you just flip a switch.
[00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:51.280]   You have to--
[00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:52.280]   Yeah, lots of adventures out there.
[00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:53.280]   Well, it depends on your hosting.
[00:41:53.280 --> 00:41:56.120]   So someone hosting sites is flipping a switch these days.
[00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:57.600]   Yeah, you can do a letter in crypt.
[00:41:57.600 --> 00:41:58.600]   Yeah.
[00:41:58.600 --> 00:41:59.600]   Yeah.
[00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:00.600]   But not everybody.
[00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:03.880]   We literally just did this last week.
[00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:04.880]   Did you, to what site?
[00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:06.880]   To all of--
[00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:12.280]   To all of-- no, actually IoT podcast because we built a Battlema A skill.
[00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:15.960]   And you have to have HTTPS to build a Battlema A skill.
[00:42:15.960 --> 00:42:21.880]   But we went to GoDaddy and we're like, hey, we need a security cert.
[00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:27.480]   They're like, give me-- I think it was like 50 or maybe 75 bucks and they turn it on.
[00:42:27.480 --> 00:42:31.320]   All of my-- it republished all of my podcasts and redownloaded it for everybody, but other
[00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:35.560]   than that, it seemed less.
[00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:37.760]   So I don't know.
[00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:39.400]   TechEye Labs is a Drupal site.
[00:42:39.400 --> 00:42:43.040]   Lullabot designed it for us maybe four years, five years ago.
[00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:45.760]   I don't know if it's that simple.
[00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:46.760]   We'll find out.
[00:42:46.760 --> 00:42:47.760]   Yeah, it depends what you're hosting on.
[00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:48.760]   Yeah.
[00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:52.160]   So I've got stuff on that page in--
[00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:56.240]   We're on-- we use a company called Blackmills.
[00:42:56.240 --> 00:42:57.240]   Yes.
[00:42:57.240 --> 00:42:58.840]   Zoom-- well, I don't know.
[00:42:58.840 --> 00:42:59.840]   I just don't know.
[00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:04.520]   Actually, Blackmesh has renamed to-- or just was acquired by Contigex.
[00:43:04.520 --> 00:43:05.520]   Contigex.
[00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:06.520]   So I don't know.
[00:43:06.520 --> 00:43:07.520]   I'll have to find out.
[00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:08.520]   If it's a simple switch, fine.
[00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:16.440]   But this is a burden to some people, right?
[00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:17.440]   Or maybe I'm wrong.
[00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:18.440]   Maybe it's just so easy now.
[00:43:18.440 --> 00:43:19.440]   Oh, yeah.
[00:43:19.440 --> 00:43:20.440]   Absolutely.
[00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:21.440]   Yeah.
[00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:24.640]   It's-- if you said when you use site, it's-- you should be able to do it straightforward
[00:43:24.640 --> 00:43:27.800]   because people have now made it straightforward, including less encrypt.
[00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:31.920]   But if you've got an old site that you need to change, yes, then it's a bunch of work.
[00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:34.000]   And that is overhead.
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:37.560]   And also, then you get into the-- do I redirect the HTTP to HTTPS, which means I'm adding
[00:43:37.560 --> 00:43:39.840]   the fragility of certificate when you're also it as well.
[00:43:39.840 --> 00:43:44.360]   So there's a set of extra things you need to think about.
[00:43:44.360 --> 00:43:48.200]   And if you sit up with HSTS, then if your certificate goes, no one gets your site at
[00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:49.200]   all.
[00:43:49.200 --> 00:43:53.600]   So there's-- yeah, there is extra fragility being added.
[00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:55.160]   Those will mostly be edge cases.
[00:43:55.160 --> 00:44:02.640]   And I guess Google's rationale is the benefit in general is so high that we want to encourage
[00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:05.720]   everybody to go to HTTPS.
[00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:06.720]   And if you're--
[00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:07.720]   But also--
[00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:09.880]   --possessing-- oh, go on, Kevin.
[00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:14.760]   Well, the other thing is if it's not HTTPS, then your ISP can man in the middle of you and
[00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:17.600]   inject stuff into the page, which they've done.
[00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:22.440]   So part of-- from Google's point of view is stopping people corrupting their site, corrupting
[00:44:22.440 --> 00:44:25.520]   other people's sites, that they're hosting as well.
[00:44:25.520 --> 00:44:27.520]   So there's a rationale for it.
[00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:36.360]   But the other thing that's changed in the last few weeks is that the DERI3C has said
[00:44:36.360 --> 00:44:42.080]   that-- and I think the other browser manufacturers have agreed-- is that any new web features
[00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:44.880]   will require HTTP/S from now on.
[00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:49.440]   So in the same way, the progressive web apps and those tools require HTTP/S, so that they
[00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:51.320]   can be sure that the code is going to the right side.
[00:44:51.320 --> 00:44:55.200]   A lot of the other new features are going to have that requirement, too, which will mean
[00:44:55.200 --> 00:44:59.440]   that in order for you to take advantage of the latest browser features, you would need
[00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:01.880]   an HTTPS site as well.
[00:45:01.880 --> 00:45:05.680]   So Kevin, correct me if I'm wrong here, but isn't there a bit of a paradox here is that
[00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:10.720]   the reason that Google can't let publishers use their own domains is because of exactly
[00:45:10.720 --> 00:45:12.640]   the security issue.
[00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:14.640]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:45:14.640 --> 00:45:15.640]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:45:15.640 --> 00:45:16.640]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:17.640]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:21.280]   No, I think that's more of a caching issue.
[00:45:21.280 --> 00:45:28.880]   But yeah, it is-- yes, they don't-- what they want to do is load all the pages into
[00:45:28.880 --> 00:45:31.640]   the same domain so you can do the site to site flip quickly.
[00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:32.960]   And doing that across the main was harder.
[00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:36.640]   So they made it-- that's why they've proxied it into the shared cache thing.
[00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:38.640]   I was told there was a security issue.
[00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:44.240]   The piece that they're-- so when you do the mobile search and you get the carousel
[00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:48.840]   and you click through to one story and then you can swipe to the other sites and that
[00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:53.200]   can be instant, getting that preload working when it wasn't the same domain was harder
[00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:54.200]   for them.
[00:45:54.200 --> 00:45:58.800]   But I was also told that if you tried to say, oh, I know this has served off something
[00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:02.240]   called AMP.Google, but really it's nytimes.com.
[00:46:02.240 --> 00:46:04.480]   It's OK, really it's OK.
[00:46:04.480 --> 00:46:08.040]   Well, that's the spoofing of a domain.
[00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:12.680]   I trust Google to do it, but there was nothing in the standard to enable it to stop others
[00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:13.680]   from using it badly.
[00:46:13.680 --> 00:46:15.480]   That's what somebody told me a year ago.
[00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:20.920]   There's more-- yeah, there's more than one way to do that.
[00:46:20.920 --> 00:46:23.480]   But yes, at one level you can't do that.
[00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:24.480]   Yes.
[00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:25.480]   And yeah.
[00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:27.920]   Kevin, are all of your sites secure?
[00:46:27.920 --> 00:46:28.920]   Nope.
[00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:29.920]   Kevin Mark's so cumbersome.
[00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:38.760]   Yeah, I've got to-- that's on my list to do.
[00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:43.240]   But some of my other tools are SVG shared.com isn't.
[00:46:43.240 --> 00:46:46.280]   I went through several of my other tool sites.
[00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:51.760]   But Kevin Mark's so calm, my host in some complicated way that I need to fix.
[00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:54.600]   It's basically currently hosted on Heroku for no good reason.
[00:46:54.600 --> 00:46:59.160]   So it's one of those, in order to fix this, I need to move it to a different hosting thing
[00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:01.000]   and I haven't grabbed to do it yet.
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:04.760]   Yeah, I mean, Twitter to it's hosted on Heroku as a Node.js app and it is secure.
[00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:07.720]   I mean, you can, but it was designed from the ground up to be secure.
[00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:11.200]   And I remember when we did it, we had to pay extra to get the developers to do that.
[00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:15.080]   There was a, there is a cost to it.
[00:47:15.080 --> 00:47:24.160]   Now, the downside is that you will be labeled in the Chrome browser URL box, not secure.
[00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:25.160]   I don't know.
[00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:28.240]   It's not like there's a big red sign saying, "Don't go to this site."
[00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:30.760]   I don't know how bad this is going to be.
[00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:34.160]   I imagine some sites will opt to be not secure.
[00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:37.640]   So, well, and that's fine.
[00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:42.200]   I was going to say I had an experience recently where I was trying to pay for an after-school
[00:47:42.200 --> 00:47:46.760]   activity or something and it was a small vendor.
[00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:47.760]   It wasn't even Shopify.
[00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:51.720]   I don't know what the payment processing was, but her site actually wasn't secure.
[00:47:51.720 --> 00:47:54.840]   And I was like, "Oh, I'm not going to send you my credit card information over this."
[00:47:54.840 --> 00:47:58.280]   And it was actually really handy and I told her about it.
[00:47:58.280 --> 00:48:02.080]   And she was like, "Oh, I don't know how to do this."
[00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:08.280]   And so, I sent her a couple resources and she was like, a week later maybe, was like,
[00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:09.400]   "I got everything worked out.
[00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:10.400]   I'm secure now.
[00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:12.240]   Thanks so much for helping me with that."
[00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:17.480]   So, and this was like, this is a mom who basically started her own, like, it was like
[00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:20.800]   tour a culture kind of business for kids.
[00:48:20.800 --> 00:48:22.680]   So I don't know.
[00:48:22.680 --> 00:48:25.160]   It feels like mountain out of a molehill.
[00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:27.600]   It's sure, I mean, I won't gain sight of it.
[00:48:27.600 --> 00:48:28.600]   It's good.
[00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:31.480]   If all the web were HTTPS, that would be a good sign.
[00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:32.480]   What's wrong with that?
[00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:37.600]   I just worry about smaller sites where this might be a burden.
[00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:39.320]   By the way, Firefox is doing it.
[00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:42.800]   Microsoft's already said, you know, this has all been going on.
[00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:51.160]   Firefox 60 will have a new not secure indicator that has a padlock that's got a line stroke
[00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:53.960]   through it.
[00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:57.200]   Microsoft's Edge and Internet Explorer will do something very similar soon.
[00:48:57.200 --> 00:48:58.800]   So everybody's going to do this.
[00:48:58.800 --> 00:49:02.440]   It's not...
[00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:06.560]   Think of it as a burden, like the same burden you have to do, like, you know, how you have
[00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:09.280]   to prove you're a citizen before you can get a job.
[00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:14.640]   You know, it's just, it's part of credentialing to say, "Hey, I'm a legitimate site on the
[00:49:14.640 --> 00:49:15.640]   web."
[00:49:15.640 --> 00:49:16.640]   Yeah.
[00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:18.920]   Thank goodness there's something, there's Let's Encrypt because that's a free, easy way
[00:49:18.920 --> 00:49:21.240]   for many sites to do it.
[00:49:21.240 --> 00:49:24.840]   And this is really, Google's been slowly working after this last year.
[00:49:24.840 --> 00:49:28.640]   They said, "Well, you get a better ranking in the search if you have HTTPS."
[00:49:28.640 --> 00:49:33.160]   So they've been slowly urging people to go in this direction.
[00:49:33.160 --> 00:49:36.480]   Here's a funny one.
[00:49:36.480 --> 00:49:40.960]   We've been saying, everybody thought that with the...
[00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:47.500]   Once an Oreo 8.1 was put on your Pixel 2 phone, that it would enable that special Pixel
[00:49:47.500 --> 00:49:50.000]   Visual Core chip so that you...
[00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:52.280]   The camera app was using it.
[00:49:52.280 --> 00:49:55.920]   On a Mario tweeted this week, "I got a fun correction from Google today.
[00:49:55.920 --> 00:50:02.040]   The Google Camera app does not use the Pixel Video Visual Core.
[00:50:02.040 --> 00:50:05.800]   Google's Camera app doesn't use Google's Camera chip."
[00:50:05.800 --> 00:50:19.080]   So Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram, all of which are going to get to use it, will be the first.
[00:50:19.080 --> 00:50:23.000]   So they don't do it because they do something called ZSL and Fast Buffering so that they
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:25.960]   get faster HDR capture.
[00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:31.240]   We don't need to take advantage of it, says the Google Pixel team.
[00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:33.200]   All right.
[00:50:33.200 --> 00:50:36.880]   I don't understand this at all.
[00:50:36.880 --> 00:50:38.880]   I don't understand.
[00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:41.280]   My brain sounds like corporate politics.
[00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:43.360]   Yeah, it's like...
[00:50:43.360 --> 00:50:45.160]   If you didn't need it, what'd you put it in the camera?
[00:50:45.160 --> 00:50:46.760]   What'd you put it in the phone for?
[00:50:46.760 --> 00:50:54.080]   Yeah, you don't design a chip and focus on this particular aspect and not use it.
[00:50:54.080 --> 00:50:56.120]   I don't understand.
[00:50:56.120 --> 00:50:58.920]   And I age.
[00:50:58.920 --> 00:51:07.200]   You know, if you read the Twitter thread after Ron's surprise comment, a lot of speculation
[00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:09.520]   about why this is.
[00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:10.960]   Maybe the most credible one is.
[00:51:10.960 --> 00:51:13.200]   Well, all the Google teams are siloed.
[00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:15.000]   They just didn't know.
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:16.240]   Yeah, I'll bet.
[00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:17.440]   Well, you put a chip in there.
[00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:19.120]   I wish you'd told us ahead of time.
[00:51:19.120 --> 00:51:20.840]   I don't like your chip.
[00:51:20.840 --> 00:51:21.920]   It's not as good as what we...
[00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:25.280]   Yeah, we're not going to use your chip because we like our chip.
[00:51:25.280 --> 00:51:27.800]   I get my code is better than your chip.
[00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:28.800]   So...
[00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:29.800]   Very strange.
[00:51:29.800 --> 00:51:33.800]   There's no way we wait straight for the Google to know what's going on.
[00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:34.720]   We're laughing.
[00:51:34.720 --> 00:51:37.000]   I think the Pixel 2 camera is still very good, right?
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:38.640]   Stacey, you agree.
[00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:39.640]   Oh, yeah.
[00:51:39.640 --> 00:51:40.640]   I love it.
[00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:42.920]   You just took a picture of a boy giving a teddy bear to your daughter with it.
[00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:44.640]   It makes me look amazing.
[00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:47.320]   And that never happens.
[00:51:47.320 --> 00:51:51.280]   All right.
[00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:53.640]   Anyway, what have we learned here?
[00:51:53.640 --> 00:51:54.640]   Don't trust...
[00:51:54.640 --> 00:51:55.640]   A little confused.
[00:51:55.640 --> 00:51:57.520]   Yeah, don't trust the tech press.
[00:51:57.520 --> 00:52:01.200]   They don't know what the hell they're talking about, including us because I said, "Oh, now
[00:52:01.200 --> 00:52:02.200]   the chips turned on.
[00:52:02.200 --> 00:52:04.200]   We're all going to get fantastic."
[00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:05.200]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:52:05.200 --> 00:52:06.200]   Yeah.
[00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:07.200]   We did talk about that.
[00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:08.200]   Yeah, everything was.
[00:52:08.200 --> 00:52:09.200]   Yeah.
[00:52:09.200 --> 00:52:11.440]   But I love Ron being straightforward.
[00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:12.440]   The same.
[00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:13.440]   Oops.
[00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:14.440]   Yeah.
[00:52:14.440 --> 00:52:15.440]   That's the right.
[00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:16.440]   That's great.
[00:52:16.440 --> 00:52:20.480]   And I'm doing it too, right now, thanks to Ron.
[00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:21.480]   Okay.
[00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:22.480]   There you go.
[00:52:22.480 --> 00:52:26.960]   Did you see the Boston Dynamics robot opening the door for the other Boston Dynamics robot?
[00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:27.960]   Right.
[00:52:27.960 --> 00:52:28.960]   And please don't do it.
[00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:30.360]   Oh, the world's doomed thing.
[00:52:30.360 --> 00:52:31.360]   It was wonderful.
[00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:32.360]   Oh, okay.
[00:52:32.360 --> 00:52:37.320]   It is cool, but I showed that to my daughter because she does not have the...
[00:52:37.320 --> 00:52:40.800]   She does not have the nightmare visions that I have about those robots.
[00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:43.600]   And she was like, "That's a little creepy, Mom."
[00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:44.600]   Yeah.
[00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:45.600]   And I was like, "Yeah."
[00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:46.600]   Thank you.
[00:52:46.600 --> 00:52:47.600]   Yeah, it is.
[00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:48.600]   Oh, no, no, no, no.
[00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:51.880]   So here comes the robot, which in itself is creepy.
[00:52:51.880 --> 00:52:54.080]   It's trying to get through a door because...
[00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:57.120]   See, there's a chance in asks its friend.
[00:52:57.120 --> 00:52:58.320]   Come here, friend.
[00:52:58.320 --> 00:53:04.000]   Here comes the friend, which is the same robot, but this one has a hand on top.
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:05.000]   Opens the door.
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:08.320]   And I love it because it props the door open with its foot.
[00:53:08.320 --> 00:53:09.320]   Yeah.
[00:53:09.320 --> 00:53:12.640]   Well, this is exactly how I open the door when my stuff...
[00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:14.120]   You know, when you've got a full hand.
[00:53:14.120 --> 00:53:15.120]   You've got a full hand.
[00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:16.120]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:53:16.120 --> 00:53:18.120]   He opens the door for his friend.
[00:53:18.120 --> 00:53:20.360]   Put your body in there and then go...
[00:53:20.360 --> 00:53:21.360]   Yeah.
[00:53:21.360 --> 00:53:22.360]   Then...
[00:53:22.360 --> 00:53:23.360]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:53:23.360 --> 00:53:24.360]   Creepy.
[00:53:24.360 --> 00:53:26.600]   Oh, it's not creepy.
[00:53:26.600 --> 00:53:29.240]   It's just a big dog is a creepy robot.
[00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:30.240]   That is...
[00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:31.240]   Not creepy.
[00:53:31.240 --> 00:53:32.880]   That base is just a creepy robot.
[00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:36.880]   My favorite tweet on this is somebody said...
[00:53:36.880 --> 00:53:41.080]   The Boston Dynamics Business Model is literally just to make viral videos.
[00:53:41.080 --> 00:53:44.480]   Yeah, because, you know, for all we know, that's not autonomous.
[00:53:44.480 --> 00:53:46.040]   I don't know if that's autonomous or...
[00:53:46.040 --> 00:53:48.000]   I mean, I don't know whether that's being controlled.
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:49.480]   I presume it's autonomous.
[00:53:49.480 --> 00:53:51.400]   Did you see the Buzzfeed?
[00:53:51.400 --> 00:53:52.400]   Did you see the Buzzfeed?
[00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:53.400]   No.
[00:53:53.400 --> 00:53:55.200]   I think it was Buzzfeed.
[00:53:55.200 --> 00:53:57.800]   Yeah, Buzzfeed did an article or not an article.
[00:53:57.800 --> 00:53:59.200]   They did a little video.
[00:53:59.200 --> 00:54:00.200]   Let's see.
[00:54:00.200 --> 00:54:01.200]   Buzzfeed.
[00:54:01.200 --> 00:54:09.200]   We're all now looking for these spot mini...
[00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:10.200]   We're all now looking for it.
[00:54:10.200 --> 00:54:11.200]   Where is it?
[00:54:11.200 --> 00:54:12.200]   Parrot parody.
[00:54:12.200 --> 00:54:13.200]   Aw, sad.
[00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:15.720]   It was one of their writers and I can't remember which one.
[00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:16.720]   Jesse's something.
[00:54:16.720 --> 00:54:19.760]   I saw it four times this morning, but I...
[00:54:19.760 --> 00:54:20.760]   Yeah, like I saw...
[00:54:20.760 --> 00:54:22.320]   It's not funny now.
[00:54:22.320 --> 00:54:23.320]   Is it this one?
[00:54:23.320 --> 00:54:24.320]   I don't know.
[00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:25.320]   I don't know if it's this one.
[00:54:25.320 --> 00:54:28.640]   Hello, I am Nautilus.
[00:54:28.640 --> 00:54:33.640]   I just got a job at Boston Dynamics Moving Boxes in the warehouse.
[00:54:33.640 --> 00:54:36.080]   Time to go for a walk to celebrate.
[00:54:36.080 --> 00:54:37.080]   Oh my.
[00:54:37.080 --> 00:54:38.680]   What a day.
[00:54:38.680 --> 00:54:42.360]   My wife and kids will be so proud of me.
[00:54:42.360 --> 00:54:45.560]   It is so beautiful here in the New England woods.
[00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:48.240]   I couldn't be happier.
[00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:49.240]   Life is great.
[00:54:49.240 --> 00:54:51.760]   If you're just listening, this is a company that videos...
[00:54:51.760 --> 00:54:52.920]   Ooh, let's hurry out here.
[00:54:52.920 --> 00:54:56.400]   We've all seen of the robots walking around.
[00:54:56.400 --> 00:54:57.400]   Yikes.
[00:54:57.400 --> 00:54:58.400]   What?
[00:54:58.400 --> 00:55:00.400]   I haven't been drinking.
[00:55:00.400 --> 00:55:01.400]   Whoa.
[00:55:01.400 --> 00:55:03.400]   Oh God.
[00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:04.400]   Okay.
[00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:09.400]   Maybe just a few drinks to help with the nerves.
[00:55:09.400 --> 00:55:11.400]   Yikes.
[00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:12.400]   Give me a break.
[00:55:12.400 --> 00:55:16.000]   That was my first job interview.
[00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:17.480]   I'm so nervous Ted.
[00:55:17.480 --> 00:55:20.400]   I hope everyone that worked likes me.
[00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:21.400]   Okay.
[00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:23.240]   Ten pound boxes.
[00:55:23.240 --> 00:55:26.680]   No problem.
[00:55:26.680 --> 00:55:30.000]   That's one.
[00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:34.680]   This stuff ain't so bad.
[00:55:34.680 --> 00:55:36.040]   Hey camera.
[00:55:36.040 --> 00:55:38.000]   Easy with the upskirt shot.
[00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:40.000]   Hahaha.
[00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:41.760]   Nailed it.
[00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:44.440]   One more box and my day is done.
[00:55:44.440 --> 00:55:46.440]   Oh.
[00:55:46.440 --> 00:55:47.600]   Hi Ted.
[00:55:47.600 --> 00:55:48.600]   What can I do for you?
[00:55:48.600 --> 00:55:50.360]   We'll take it easy Ted.
[00:55:50.360 --> 00:55:51.360]   Blow yikes.
[00:55:51.360 --> 00:55:52.920]   Ted is...
[00:55:52.920 --> 00:55:53.920]   Come on man.
[00:55:53.920 --> 00:55:55.480]   I just need to move this last box.
[00:55:55.480 --> 00:55:57.480]   Wishing him around with a hockey stick.
[00:55:57.480 --> 00:55:58.480]   You've seen that.
[00:55:58.480 --> 00:55:59.480]   Ted with the f***.
[00:55:59.480 --> 00:56:00.480]   Hahaha.
[00:56:00.480 --> 00:56:01.480]   Okay.
[00:56:01.480 --> 00:56:02.480]   I get it.
[00:56:02.480 --> 00:56:04.680]   Hazing the new guy.
[00:56:04.680 --> 00:56:05.680]   Well you've had your father.
[00:56:05.680 --> 00:56:07.160]   Ted really isn't it.
[00:56:07.160 --> 00:56:08.160]   Hahaha.
[00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:09.160]   F***.
[00:56:09.160 --> 00:56:10.160]   Hahaha.
[00:56:10.160 --> 00:56:12.280]   Ted, just let me do my f*** job.
[00:56:12.280 --> 00:56:13.280]   Seriously.
[00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:14.280]   Poor Carson.
[00:56:14.280 --> 00:56:16.080]   That's the more call these things.
[00:56:16.080 --> 00:56:18.200]   You kidding me?
[00:56:18.200 --> 00:56:20.200]   Hahaha.
[00:56:20.200 --> 00:56:21.640]   Your real jerk Ted.
[00:56:21.640 --> 00:56:22.640]   Hahaha.
[00:56:22.640 --> 00:56:23.640]   F***.
[00:56:23.640 --> 00:56:24.640]   F***.
[00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:26.640]   I'm not going to do it.
[00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:28.640]   I'm not going to do it.
[00:56:28.640 --> 00:56:29.640]   I'm not going to do it.
[00:56:29.640 --> 00:56:30.640]   I'm not going to do it.
[00:56:30.640 --> 00:56:31.640]   I'm not going to do it.
[00:56:31.640 --> 00:56:32.640]   I'm not going to do it.
[00:56:32.640 --> 00:56:33.640]   I'm not going to do it.
[00:56:33.640 --> 00:56:34.640]   I'm not going to do it.
[00:56:34.640 --> 00:56:35.640]   I'm not going to do it.
[00:56:35.640 --> 00:56:36.640]   I'm not going to do it.
[00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:37.640]   I'm not going to do it.
[00:56:37.640 --> 00:56:38.640]   I'm not going to do it.
[00:56:38.640 --> 00:56:39.640]   I'm not going to do it.
[00:56:39.640 --> 00:56:40.640]   I'm not going to do it.
[00:56:40.640 --> 00:56:41.640]   I'm not going to do it.
[00:56:41.640 --> 00:56:42.640]   F***.
[00:56:42.640 --> 00:56:43.640]   I'm not going to do it.
[00:56:43.640 --> 00:56:44.640]   F***.
[00:56:44.640 --> 00:56:45.640]   I'm not going to do it.
[00:56:45.640 --> 00:56:46.640]   F***.
[00:56:46.640 --> 00:56:47.640]   I'm not going to do it.
[00:56:47.640 --> 00:56:48.640]   F***.
[00:56:48.640 --> 00:56:49.640]   I'm not going to do it.
[00:56:49.640 --> 00:56:50.640]   F***.
[00:56:50.640 --> 00:56:51.640]   I don't need a f***ing.
[00:56:51.640 --> 00:56:52.640]   F***.
[00:56:52.640 --> 00:56:53.640]   This place.
[00:56:53.640 --> 00:56:54.640]   I'm sorry.
[00:56:54.640 --> 00:56:55.640]   I had to do that.
[00:56:55.640 --> 00:57:00.640]   I don't know if that's the one you were talking about.
[00:57:00.640 --> 00:57:02.640]   That wasn't what that was amusing.
[00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:05.640]   This one started people, but I cannot find it for the life of the future.
[00:57:05.640 --> 00:57:06.640]   It's okay.
[00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:07.640]   That was better.
[00:57:07.640 --> 00:57:09.640]   No, that was really...
[00:57:09.640 --> 00:57:13.640]   I apologize for those of you watching live hearing all those sounds.
[00:57:13.640 --> 00:57:16.640]   It's kind of like watching a Logan Paul video, wasn't it?
[00:57:16.640 --> 00:57:19.640]   Speaking of which...
[00:57:19.640 --> 00:57:25.360]   YouTube says Logan, you can't make any more money after your recent pattern of behavior,
[00:57:25.360 --> 00:57:27.640]   but just for a few months, then we'll get you back.
[00:57:27.640 --> 00:57:34.640]   Logan Paul really has just continued to push the envelope first by showing a dead body.
[00:57:34.640 --> 00:57:41.120]   Now, after that, instead of being contrite and cleaning up his act, he's done all sorts
[00:57:41.120 --> 00:57:42.120]   of things.
[00:57:42.120 --> 00:57:46.040]   I think he tased a dead rat.
[00:57:46.040 --> 00:57:49.800]   He took a fish out of a pond to give it CPR.
[00:57:49.800 --> 00:57:55.040]   He encouraged his followers to eat tide pods.
[00:57:55.040 --> 00:58:01.600]   So YouTube said, in response to Logan Paul's recent pattern of behavior, we've temporarily
[00:58:01.600 --> 00:58:04.040]   suspended ads on his channels.
[00:58:04.040 --> 00:58:08.360]   You know what the Boston robots robot would call them?
[00:58:08.360 --> 00:58:09.360]   Temporarily.
[00:58:09.360 --> 00:58:10.360]   Temporarily.
[00:58:10.360 --> 00:58:14.120]   We don't know how temporary it will be, but YouTube makes...
[00:58:14.120 --> 00:58:17.720]   If Logan Paul makes it and it's estimated he does make one and a half million at least
[00:58:17.720 --> 00:58:22.480]   a year, that means YouTube must be making twice that.
[00:58:22.480 --> 00:58:23.480]   So...
[00:58:23.480 --> 00:58:24.480]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:58:24.480 --> 00:58:25.480]   Did I say a year?
[00:58:25.480 --> 00:58:26.480]   A month.
[00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:31.840]   1.2 million, according to social blade, 1.2 million a month.
[00:58:31.840 --> 00:58:35.760]   And I'm guessing that YouTube gives him 50%.
[00:58:35.760 --> 00:58:36.760]   We don't know.
[00:58:36.760 --> 00:58:38.400]   YouTube never said.
[00:58:38.400 --> 00:58:42.800]   But if it's cost in Logan Paul, a million to a month, it must be cost in YouTube a million
[00:58:42.800 --> 00:58:43.800]   a month.
[00:58:43.800 --> 00:58:45.800]   So you don't even suspend it for too long.
[00:58:45.800 --> 00:58:46.800]   Maybe a week.
[00:58:46.800 --> 00:58:47.800]   A few days.
[00:58:47.800 --> 00:58:51.600]   Well, so this is by no means to excuse him.
[00:58:51.600 --> 00:58:53.800]   So he's 22.
[00:58:53.800 --> 00:58:58.200]   And I feel like if you actually...
[00:58:58.200 --> 00:59:01.480]   It's a chance to guide him a little bit and say, "Hey, yo, that's...
[00:59:01.480 --> 00:59:03.160]   You've gone too far.
[00:59:03.160 --> 00:59:04.160]   You're done for now."
[00:59:04.160 --> 00:59:07.680]   It's a mixed message, though, Stacey, because really the audience has been guiding him to
[00:59:07.680 --> 00:59:08.680]   get more extreme, right?
[00:59:08.680 --> 00:59:11.160]   Because the audience numbers go up, he makes more money.
[00:59:11.160 --> 00:59:14.720]   You'll get to a million to a month by being boring.
[00:59:14.720 --> 00:59:19.840]   You get to a million to a month by bliding mattresses on fire and doing crazy stuff.
[00:59:19.840 --> 00:59:21.280]   Well, yeah.
[00:59:21.280 --> 00:59:24.760]   But YouTube is saying, "This is where we're going to draw the line."
[00:59:24.760 --> 00:59:27.640]   And saying, "All right, you can come back and now you know."
[00:59:27.640 --> 00:59:30.440]   I mean, if he goes over again, that's different.
[00:59:30.440 --> 00:59:35.000]   But he hasn't had any guidance, really, from he...
[00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:36.680]   Where are his parents?
[00:59:36.680 --> 00:59:38.240]   He has no moral compass.
[00:59:38.240 --> 00:59:44.920]   Well, meanwhile, you have a YouTube executive looking down their nose at Facebook, but they're
[00:59:44.920 --> 00:59:48.160]   all looking down their noses at each other, and none of them has their act fully together.
[00:59:48.160 --> 00:59:49.160]   Yeah.
[00:59:49.160 --> 00:59:50.160]   I didn't put down the rundown.
[00:59:50.160 --> 00:59:55.960]   But, like Casey Neistat, I didn't realize until last week was gone from CNN already.
[00:59:55.960 --> 00:59:59.200]   Yeah, Beam or Beamy, whatever he calls that service, Beam, I guess.
[00:59:59.200 --> 01:00:01.040]   You don't have to know now.
[01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:02.040]   Yeah.
[01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:03.840]   How much did CNN pay for that?
[01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:04.840]   I don't think about.
[01:00:04.840 --> 01:00:06.680]   In January 25, they're out.
[01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:12.440]   So anyway, Casey interviewed the head of Robert Kinsle, the head of one of the heads of YouTube.
[01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:19.200]   Not the $25 million last year, Beam, that we've bought from Casey, and they're shutting it down.
[01:00:19.200 --> 01:00:23.520]   Oh, well, why don't I get any of that stupid money?
[01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:24.520]   I want some of that stupid money.
[01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:26.200]   That's sweet, sweet, sweet media money.
[01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:27.680]   Because you've got to marry your half-backwoods.
[01:00:27.680 --> 01:00:29.240]   It's sweet, stupid money.
[01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:30.240]   That's media desperate.
[01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:31.680]   Media desperation cash.
[01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:33.240]   You know what?
[01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:38.240]   You're not.
[01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:40.240]   And I wonder how much of this is a, and this is probably just me projecting, but a backlash
[01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:44.240]   against that kind of bro culture that that juvenile.
[01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:45.240]   I think that's what it is.
[01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:46.240]   Yeah.
[01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:50.320]   I don't know if that's all of this, but it certainly has to play into it.
[01:00:50.320 --> 01:00:54.560]   The problem is that these mainstream media folks and YouTube and everybody else really
[01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:57.680]   wants the 18 to 25-year-old.
[01:00:57.680 --> 01:00:59.560]   And they're not watching TV.
[01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:01.560]   Nobody knows how to reach them.
[01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:04.840]   Advertisers are desperate to reach them because you know, you get kids eating type pods early.
[01:01:04.840 --> 01:01:10.600]   They'll be eating type pods their whole life.
[01:01:10.600 --> 01:01:13.840]   So we should inevitably be very short.
[01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:16.440]   That's supposed to be true, but there might be long hair.
[01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:21.440]   It won't be a long life, but at least you'll have good sales on your tide pods.
[01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:23.720]   No, don't kids don't eat tide pods.
[01:01:23.720 --> 01:01:24.720]   Okay?
[01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:25.720]   It's not good for you.
[01:01:25.720 --> 01:01:29.600]   They look delicious, but they're not.
[01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:34.280]   20, actually, this is more serious than we were making.
[01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:36.360]   Now, there's 22 people working for the beam team.
[01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:38.600]   They're probably all out of work.
[01:01:38.600 --> 01:01:42.000]   They created a beam news for CNN.
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:49.200]   A scant 269,000 subscribers, more than ours, and they'd only put out a few dozen videos.
[01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:54.240]   So apparently it wasn't reaching those 18 to 25-year-olds like CNN was hoping.
[01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:58.080]   Yeah, they're not going to reach the 18 to 25-year-olds.
[01:01:58.080 --> 01:01:59.400]   Those kids fall down to YouTube.
[01:01:59.400 --> 01:02:00.400]   You know what they're doing?
[01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:04.040]   They're busy being mad at Snapchat.
[01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:05.040]   That's what they're doing.
[01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:06.640]   Yeah, it's a piece by the way.
[01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:07.840]   They are enraged.
[01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:12.360]   Now, I, okay, maybe I just don't use Snapchat enough.
[01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:13.360]   The Snapchat...
[01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:14.360]   You're too old.
[01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:17.000]   I don't get it.
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:23.420]   I acknowledge that the Snapchat user interface has been slightly modified.
[01:02:23.420 --> 01:02:25.240]   Not so much that...
[01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:27.120]   But this is making...
[01:02:27.120 --> 01:02:30.520]   These tweens crazy.
[01:02:30.520 --> 01:02:35.200]   Hundreds of thousands of petition signatures, I think it was 300,000.
[01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:39.120]   Tens of thousands of tweets.
[01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:41.180]   They want Snapchat to go back to the old...
[01:02:41.180 --> 01:02:47.540]   To the point where Snapchat's actually starting to take it seriously and said, "Well, we like
[01:02:47.540 --> 01:02:52.880]   our new design, but if you don't agree, maybe we'll change it back."
[01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:53.880]   You've actually started to acknowledge it.
[01:02:53.880 --> 01:02:58.260]   Maybe they're going to change it back.
[01:02:58.260 --> 01:03:06.820]   There was a fake tweet saying that Snapchat had promised to...
[01:03:06.820 --> 01:03:12.140]   This is from Isaac Svobudny, who has said, "I made this up."
[01:03:12.140 --> 01:03:13.660]   The Snapchat update sucks.
[01:03:13.660 --> 01:03:15.340]   Retweet to save a life.
[01:03:15.340 --> 01:03:17.940]   Then he has a fake Snapchat posting.
[01:03:17.940 --> 01:03:20.140]   How does 50,000 retweet sound?
[01:03:20.140 --> 01:03:23.840]   1.5 million retweets.
[01:03:23.840 --> 01:03:28.380]   I mean, if you're Snapchat, I guess you're paying attention to that.
[01:03:28.380 --> 01:03:30.760]   Does anybody have an opinion on this?
[01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:32.480]   I'm asking the wrong people.
[01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:33.480]   I know.
[01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:35.360]   But they said, "I think it looks the same to me.
[01:03:35.360 --> 01:03:37.240]   What does your daughter say?"
[01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:41.080]   She's not on Snapchat, but I feel like Chrissy Teigen.
[01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:47.860]   Chrissy Teigen, Marcus Brownlee, who is now on the same level as Chrissy Teigen apparently,
[01:03:47.860 --> 01:03:52.440]   and somebody at one other celebrity all said, "No, you've got to change this."
[01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:53.440]   She's not...
[01:03:53.440 --> 01:03:56.040]   What was their own protection?
[01:03:56.040 --> 01:03:57.840]   Because when people...
[01:03:57.840 --> 01:03:58.840]   She can't see...
[01:03:58.840 --> 01:04:03.520]   Oh, it's something about making people look like friends when they're not friends or...
[01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:04.520]   I don't know.
[01:04:04.520 --> 01:04:05.520]   Oh, okay.
[01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:12.120]   We remember News Feed was roundly unpopular and zuck-stuck by it, so sometimes they're
[01:04:12.120 --> 01:04:13.120]   right.
[01:04:13.120 --> 01:04:16.400]   600,000 signatures on the change.org.
[01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:18.340]   Oh, no, I'm sorry.
[01:04:18.340 --> 01:04:19.340]   Let me update that.
[01:04:19.340 --> 01:04:26.660]   991,000 signatures on the change.org site.
[01:04:26.660 --> 01:04:30.060]   It's made many features more difficult.
[01:04:30.060 --> 01:04:31.060]   So...
[01:04:31.060 --> 01:04:36.620]   Yeah, I think it was that she couldn't see things that her fans were trying to tell her.
[01:04:36.620 --> 01:04:44.900]   So she was frustrated, and then her actual friends, the way that the people you follow,
[01:04:44.900 --> 01:04:46.980]   their stuff shows up was frustrating.
[01:04:46.980 --> 01:04:52.180]   Yeah, and then people were breaking their streaks.
[01:04:52.180 --> 01:04:54.940]   Oh, God, not the streaks.
[01:04:54.940 --> 01:04:58.180]   The streaks, something about the streaks.
[01:04:58.180 --> 01:05:03.620]   However, meanwhile, can I related?
[01:05:03.620 --> 01:05:05.420]   Actually, I think that's something very good this week.
[01:05:05.420 --> 01:05:09.740]   Chrissy Teigen has moved on, her latest tweet, "Craft makes a thick and creamy version of
[01:05:09.740 --> 01:05:12.820]   their original Mac and Cheese, but why not just replace the original with it?
[01:05:12.820 --> 01:05:13.820]   It's infinitely better."
[01:05:13.820 --> 01:05:14.820]   So she's moved on now.
[01:05:14.820 --> 01:05:17.540]   She's worried about Mac and Cheese.
[01:05:17.540 --> 01:05:18.980]   She is worried about lots of things.
[01:05:18.980 --> 01:05:20.180]   She is an all-around general person.
[01:05:20.180 --> 01:05:25.660]   She's really a firebrand in the social sphere.
[01:05:25.660 --> 01:05:28.020]   She's making the world a better place.
[01:05:28.020 --> 01:05:31.380]   So it snapped in something very good this week for news sites.
[01:05:31.380 --> 01:05:32.380]   Yes.
[01:05:32.380 --> 01:05:37.220]   My friend, Ronald Chopra, who left Storerful, who's now there in charge of news stuff,
[01:05:37.220 --> 01:05:42.260]   they made the Snap Map, which is really actually very useful, embeddable, particularly in
[01:05:42.260 --> 01:05:43.260]   news sites.
[01:05:43.260 --> 01:05:45.460]   So you have the Women's March going on.
[01:05:45.460 --> 01:05:49.060]   You want to see what it's like from the people who were there.
[01:05:49.060 --> 01:05:54.620]   This enables you to put the map with the steps of the Republic.
[01:05:54.620 --> 01:05:55.620]   So the two things about it.
[01:05:55.620 --> 01:05:59.980]   One is the things that people chose to share publicly, and two, there is an identity, which
[01:05:59.980 --> 01:06:02.900]   you can go both ways on that.
[01:06:02.900 --> 01:06:04.540]   Three, do I say two?
[01:06:04.540 --> 01:06:07.740]   Three, it'll expire after 30 days.
[01:06:07.740 --> 01:06:12.820]   Nonetheless, it's a neat use of a way to hear from people who are at an event.
[01:06:12.820 --> 01:06:19.900]   And Snap does algorithmically and humanly curate or pick out the worst of the stuff.
[01:06:19.900 --> 01:06:26.060]   And it's very, very hard, they tell me, to spoof a location.
[01:06:26.060 --> 01:06:28.180]   So if you say you're at the Women's March in Washington, you're at the Women's March
[01:06:28.180 --> 01:06:29.180]   in Washington.
[01:06:29.180 --> 01:06:30.780]   So I think it's pretty cool.
[01:06:30.780 --> 01:06:35.580]   If you go to map.snapchat.com and look up somewhere like New York right now.
[01:06:35.580 --> 01:06:41.620]   Is it just a map of people using Snapchat in that location?
[01:06:41.620 --> 01:06:42.620]   It's the Snap.
[01:06:42.620 --> 01:06:44.380]   There's a heat map there.
[01:06:44.380 --> 01:06:46.900]   So I'm in New Orleans from Artie Grot.
[01:06:46.900 --> 01:06:53.180]   Oh, I'm going to talk on the bar by the health laws.
[01:06:53.180 --> 01:06:57.260]   That really is an old man response.
[01:06:57.260 --> 01:06:59.980]   You know, that's violating health laws.
[01:06:59.980 --> 01:07:01.900]   Get off my bar.
[01:07:01.900 --> 01:07:02.900]   Get off my bar.
[01:07:02.900 --> 01:07:04.980]   Wow, something's going on north of us.
[01:07:04.980 --> 01:07:06.860]   Here's a hot red dot.
[01:07:06.860 --> 01:07:08.260]   Look at that, north of Petaluma.
[01:07:08.260 --> 01:07:09.580]   I don't know what's going on.
[01:07:09.580 --> 01:07:10.580]   What's going on there?
[01:07:10.580 --> 01:07:11.580]   Click on it.
[01:07:11.580 --> 01:07:12.580]   Click on it.
[01:07:12.580 --> 01:07:13.580]   Well, I see snaps.
[01:07:13.580 --> 01:07:14.580]   Yeah, so good.
[01:07:14.580 --> 01:07:15.580]   So many.
[01:07:15.580 --> 01:07:27.340]   Looks like they're putting the guys attaching a rubber glove to his exhaust.
[01:07:27.340 --> 01:07:28.340]   So that's exciting.
[01:07:28.340 --> 01:07:29.500]   It's really dangerous, couldn't it?
[01:07:29.500 --> 01:07:33.180]   Yeah, I think that's literally where the hotspot is.
[01:07:33.180 --> 01:07:34.180]   Let's see where else.
[01:07:34.180 --> 01:07:36.380]   Let's see what's going on in Mardi Gras.
[01:07:36.380 --> 01:07:37.380]   Yeah.
[01:07:37.380 --> 01:07:40.060]   Yeah, so it's actually going.
[01:07:40.060 --> 01:07:44.780]   It's actually hotter in Santa Rosa.
[01:07:44.780 --> 01:07:48.380]   So these are people snapping in this area.
[01:07:48.380 --> 01:07:49.380]   Yes.
[01:07:49.380 --> 01:07:50.460]   But these are publics.
[01:07:50.460 --> 01:07:52.700]   So tell me that these are stories.
[01:07:52.700 --> 01:07:53.700]   These are stories.
[01:07:53.700 --> 01:07:55.100]   They chose a second public.
[01:07:55.100 --> 01:07:56.100]   Okay.
[01:07:56.100 --> 01:07:57.100]   Yes.
[01:07:57.100 --> 01:08:03.300]   Well, now this actually is cool because...
[01:08:03.300 --> 01:08:07.620]   This is actually cool because this broads your stories.
[01:08:07.620 --> 01:08:08.620]   Yeah.
[01:08:08.620 --> 01:08:10.620]   Now you mentioned there's a new...
[01:08:10.620 --> 01:08:15.220]   There's a high school shooting that just happened in Broward County.
[01:08:15.220 --> 01:08:16.780]   And there's snaps from there too.
[01:08:16.780 --> 01:08:19.700]   So this is where news would be very...
[01:08:19.700 --> 01:08:20.700]   Of great...
[01:08:20.700 --> 01:08:22.460]   I don't know what we're going to see here.
[01:08:22.460 --> 01:08:26.420]   You have police at the high school and so forth.
[01:08:26.420 --> 01:08:27.420]   There was...
[01:08:27.420 --> 01:08:32.300]   I saw some terrifying pictures from within classrooms of kids hiding and things like that.
[01:08:32.300 --> 01:08:33.300]   Okay.
[01:08:33.300 --> 01:08:34.300]   Yeah.
[01:08:34.300 --> 01:08:35.300]   So this is interesting.
[01:08:35.300 --> 01:08:37.020]   Actually, I think this is a useful tool.
[01:08:37.020 --> 01:08:38.020]   It is.
[01:08:38.020 --> 01:08:42.100]   So interesting to me too is that with our role there, there...
[01:08:42.100 --> 01:08:44.540]   You have various...
[01:08:44.540 --> 01:08:48.580]   All the platforms now have a different relationship with news.
[01:08:48.580 --> 01:08:52.580]   You have Googles holding the DNI right now here in Amsterdam.
[01:08:52.580 --> 01:08:55.580]   Facebook's trying to get more like tough love talk.
[01:08:55.580 --> 01:09:01.580]   Kebel Brown was at code saying, "If you don't be on Facebook, don't be on Facebook."
[01:09:01.580 --> 01:09:02.580]   You have...
[01:09:02.580 --> 01:09:05.340]   No, unless they're still doing good things for news companies.
[01:09:05.340 --> 01:09:09.900]   Then you have Snap now trying to demystify themselves for news companies.
[01:09:09.900 --> 01:09:14.660]   So I think there's an opportunity here for flight to quality with the platforms working
[01:09:14.660 --> 01:09:17.220]   with the news companies, but then I'm an optimist.
[01:09:17.220 --> 01:09:18.220]   Yeah.
[01:09:18.220 --> 01:09:19.980]   You also should disclose your Facebook relationship.
[01:09:19.980 --> 01:09:20.980]   Oh, yes.
[01:09:20.980 --> 01:09:21.980]   Thank you very much.
[01:09:21.980 --> 01:09:22.980]   Thank you.
[01:09:22.980 --> 01:09:23.980]   I'm going to do that.
[01:09:23.980 --> 01:09:24.980]   Yes.
[01:09:24.980 --> 01:09:27.660]   So I started the news integrity initiative, which is funded and great measure by Facebook
[01:09:27.660 --> 01:09:31.100]   as well as Craig Newmark, the Ford Foundation and others.
[01:09:31.100 --> 01:09:34.180]   I received no personal funds whatsoever from Facebook.
[01:09:34.180 --> 01:09:37.700]   I'm here at Google DNI and they did not pay for me to be here.
[01:09:37.700 --> 01:09:39.380]   They did not pay my travel.
[01:09:39.380 --> 01:09:40.540]   Just so you know.
[01:09:40.540 --> 01:09:43.980]   And I just want everybody to know I bought my home pod with my own damn money.
[01:09:43.980 --> 01:09:46.060]   No, I bought one for Kevin.
[01:09:46.060 --> 01:09:47.740]   He did not like it.
[01:09:47.740 --> 01:09:48.980]   You bought one for him?
[01:09:48.980 --> 01:09:51.180]   Well, he's doing it for our sake.
[01:09:51.180 --> 01:09:52.180]   Kevin Toffle.
[01:09:52.180 --> 01:09:53.180]   Kevin Toffle.
[01:09:53.180 --> 01:09:54.180]   No, not Kevin Marks.
[01:09:54.180 --> 01:09:55.180]   Sorry, Kevin Marks.
[01:09:55.180 --> 01:09:57.180]   I would never buy you anything in a closed ecosystem.
[01:09:57.180 --> 01:09:59.180]   Oh, that's okay.
[01:09:59.180 --> 01:10:02.620]   That's romantic for Valentine's Day.
[01:10:02.620 --> 01:10:05.900]   I would never buy you anything from a closed ecosystem.
[01:10:05.900 --> 01:10:07.820]   I like it.
[01:10:07.820 --> 01:10:09.140]   What happened with pork?
[01:10:09.140 --> 01:10:11.540]   Maybe I shouldn't say pork, Quinn Norton.
[01:10:11.540 --> 01:10:14.220]   Quinn Norton who I admire very much for.
[01:10:14.220 --> 01:10:15.220]   Do you know Quinn?
[01:10:15.220 --> 01:10:18.940]   Anybody should admire her writing quite a bit at Wired.
[01:10:18.940 --> 01:10:19.940]   Good byline.
[01:10:19.940 --> 01:10:24.860]   She went briefly to join the editorial board of the New York Times briefly like for an
[01:10:24.860 --> 01:10:31.660]   hour or two, then apparently the New York Times read previous tweets that they didn't.
[01:10:31.660 --> 01:10:33.100]   And the post.
[01:10:33.100 --> 01:10:35.100]   And they deemed unseemly.
[01:10:35.100 --> 01:10:36.740]   It's not the same as that.
[01:10:36.740 --> 01:10:39.020]   Everyone on Twitter read them and sent them to them.
[01:10:39.020 --> 01:10:40.540]   Yeah, which is what happens.
[01:10:40.540 --> 01:10:41.780]   There was a huge pile on.
[01:10:41.780 --> 01:10:42.940]   Yeah, which will happen.
[01:10:42.940 --> 01:10:45.220]   But she she I knew you were trying to do you with time.
[01:10:45.220 --> 01:10:46.740]   She says she's fine with it.
[01:10:46.740 --> 01:10:48.700]   But I don't I'm not sure.
[01:10:48.700 --> 01:10:54.500]   But I don't know if those tweets really were it she was in this is a problem and she's even
[01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:58.380]   written an article I remember she went on about the lack of context on Twitter and she
[01:10:58.380 --> 01:11:04.180]   says this is what's actually happened the same thing to me now to my tweets because the
[01:11:04.180 --> 01:11:10.780]   lack of context on what I was saying in Twitter makes them look racist and I'm not.
[01:11:10.780 --> 01:11:12.900]   In any event she says fine.
[01:11:12.900 --> 01:11:15.740]   I don't want to join your stupid board anyway.
[01:11:15.740 --> 01:11:21.900]   There's a lot more really around the op-ed page high rate of some conservative writers.
[01:11:21.900 --> 01:11:24.180]   There's another one going on right now.
[01:11:24.180 --> 01:11:27.100]   Huffington Post has a transcript of people complaining about the high rate of Barry
[01:11:27.100 --> 01:11:28.100]   Weiss.
[01:11:28.100 --> 01:11:32.100]   There's what's his name who was hired from the Wall Street Journal.
[01:11:32.100 --> 01:11:36.780]   I forget his name is something like chatroom help.
[01:11:36.780 --> 01:11:41.220]   Can you check your Mike your your your back off to the laptop Mike.
[01:11:41.220 --> 01:11:42.460]   I just I am.
[01:11:42.460 --> 01:11:45.820]   Yeah, I think so.
[01:11:45.820 --> 01:11:49.620]   So you're saying that the New York Times board is a little hypersensitive right now
[01:11:49.620 --> 01:11:53.220]   because they're getting a lot of criticism anyway and they did.
[01:11:53.220 --> 01:11:56.540]   Yeah, they're like pandering to Trump supporters.
[01:11:56.540 --> 01:12:00.820]   Well they did that weird editorial post where they just said let's just hear from some
[01:12:00.820 --> 01:12:01.820]   Trump supporters.
[01:12:01.820 --> 01:12:05.100]   What they think which I mean that's fine.
[01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:06.820]   I don't you know whatever.
[01:12:06.820 --> 01:12:12.180]   Let's hear now tap your yeah yeah now you're on the right mic.
[01:12:12.180 --> 01:12:13.860]   So maybe it was not wrong.
[01:12:13.860 --> 01:12:15.140]   I just don't plug and re-plug.
[01:12:15.140 --> 01:12:16.140]   Yeah, that's better.
[01:12:16.140 --> 01:12:17.140]   That sounds so much better.
[01:12:17.140 --> 01:12:19.860]   I should let I said something.
[01:12:19.860 --> 01:12:25.460]   So and it seemed like the tweets that were bothering people were from 2014.
[01:12:25.460 --> 01:12:26.460]   Yeah.
[01:12:26.460 --> 01:12:28.780]   And she is talking about being friends with.
[01:12:28.780 --> 01:12:30.060]   And a wave.
[01:12:30.060 --> 01:12:31.060]   Yeah.
[01:12:31.060 --> 01:12:32.540]   Yeah with we've.
[01:12:32.540 --> 01:12:35.740]   And then she's also.
[01:12:35.740 --> 01:12:41.300]   She says I don't like we've he's a terrible person but he is an old friend of mine.
[01:12:41.300 --> 01:12:45.260]   I don't think that that's necessarily cause for.
[01:12:45.260 --> 01:12:46.260]   Fire it.
[01:12:46.260 --> 01:12:47.260]   I don't know.
[01:12:47.260 --> 01:12:50.420]   I mean if you look at my dad or something you'd be like why would Stacy have any credentials
[01:12:50.420 --> 01:12:51.420]   right but.
[01:12:51.420 --> 01:12:52.420]   Yeah.
[01:12:52.420 --> 01:12:55.620]   It's it's different though if you're talking about someone who's your friend.
[01:12:55.620 --> 01:12:57.380]   Roll your dad under the bus.
[01:12:57.380 --> 01:13:01.060]   Well, I mean he is very different.
[01:13:01.060 --> 01:13:05.740]   He has very different viewpoints than I do and they're not they're not popular on Twitter.
[01:13:05.740 --> 01:13:07.300]   I can tell you that right now.
[01:13:07.300 --> 01:13:11.540]   We should we should mention that we've is considered a neo-Nazi and so that's where.
[01:13:11.540 --> 01:13:12.860]   My dad is not a neo-Nazi.
[01:13:12.860 --> 01:13:14.420]   I should say that he is not.
[01:13:14.420 --> 01:13:17.740]   He's just very very very very very conservative.
[01:13:17.740 --> 01:13:18.740]   Yeah.
[01:13:18.740 --> 01:13:19.740]   He's.
[01:13:19.740 --> 01:13:20.740]   Unilever.
[01:13:20.740 --> 01:13:21.740]   Throw it.
[01:13:21.740 --> 01:13:22.740]   The.
[01:13:22.740 --> 01:13:23.740]   Say again and.
[01:13:23.740 --> 01:13:27.620]   He's a part of the country where that's very common and and part of the problem here is
[01:13:27.620 --> 01:13:32.700]   that we're not listening to folks in those parts of the country so.
[01:13:32.700 --> 01:13:38.580]   Well, she she also I believe called people faggot.
[01:13:38.580 --> 01:13:41.940]   Yeah, she's a that's slur.
[01:13:41.940 --> 01:13:44.420]   But again, context is really important.
[01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:46.540]   I mean, I yeah.
[01:13:46.540 --> 01:13:48.220]   So I don't know.
[01:13:48.220 --> 01:13:55.620]   So she did that in the context of they were people she knew from four or two and she and
[01:13:55.620 --> 01:13:58.620]   it was in the time when your tweets vanished quickly.
[01:13:58.620 --> 01:14:03.380]   So yeah, it probably wasn't a great thing to use to do on Twitter, but she was using
[01:14:03.380 --> 01:14:04.380]   it.
[01:14:04.380 --> 01:14:07.540]   It basically she was using their vernacular.
[01:14:07.540 --> 01:14:09.580]   So that was the you know, that was what was going on there.
[01:14:09.580 --> 01:14:13.900]   So it was a context collapsing.
[01:14:13.900 --> 01:14:18.580]   The thing that Quinn does is that she is does the kind of journalism where you go and embed
[01:14:18.580 --> 01:14:21.820]   yourself in a subculture and make sense of it and then come back and write about it.
[01:14:21.820 --> 01:14:23.180]   And she's really good at this.
[01:14:23.180 --> 01:14:24.180]   She did with occupy.
[01:14:24.180 --> 01:14:25.180]   She's anonymous.
[01:14:25.180 --> 01:14:27.460]   She's she did it with 4chan.
[01:14:27.460 --> 01:14:29.660]   She's done it with a bunch of other places like that.
[01:14:29.660 --> 01:14:33.460]   And so part of what they found was was what she was doing there.
[01:14:33.460 --> 01:14:36.660]   That's why she would have been very good for the times because they really need someone
[01:14:36.660 --> 01:14:40.940]   to explain the nuances of this stuff and help them understand this rather than just saying,
[01:14:40.940 --> 01:14:47.940]   Oh, let's get some Trump supporters in saying, you know, why is there an alienated set of
[01:14:47.940 --> 01:14:51.900]   people who don't who don't believe the New York Times will ever say anything to them.
[01:14:51.900 --> 01:14:54.220]   And and Quinn would be able to help.
[01:14:54.220 --> 01:14:59.260]   And the irony of this is she wrote the kind of definitive article and medium about context
[01:14:59.260 --> 01:15:03.740]   collapse in which she says I dance with the trolls and I enjoy it.
[01:15:03.740 --> 01:15:06.100]   I have some wonderfully sketchy internet friends.
[01:15:06.100 --> 01:15:10.100]   This comes from covering anonymous and other lovely crazy hackers and anarchists over the
[01:15:10.100 --> 01:15:11.100]   years.
[01:15:11.100 --> 01:15:14.940]   I have a deep affection for their horribly rude talk and the strange problems are trying
[01:15:14.940 --> 01:15:15.940]   to solve.
[01:15:15.940 --> 01:15:19.140]   Sometimes they're stupid, sometimes brilliant, more often a bit of both.
[01:15:19.140 --> 01:15:25.140]   The problem is that people she's talking exactly about this problem and then she gets
[01:15:25.140 --> 01:15:27.900]   bit by it, which is kind of amazing.
[01:15:27.900 --> 01:15:28.900]   Right.
[01:15:28.900 --> 01:15:33.700]   What's trying to say is that if you start to run a lot of things, you know, you're
[01:15:33.700 --> 01:15:37.180]   reject people by their association with somebody you don't like.
[01:15:37.180 --> 01:15:38.900]   Yeah, that's a slippery slope.
[01:15:38.900 --> 01:15:39.900]   Yeah.
[01:15:39.900 --> 01:15:45.820]   Well, we this is the Twitter problem and frankly, yeah, in 2013 and 2014, I think probably nobody
[01:15:45.820 --> 01:15:49.660]   realized that things you say on Twitter could bite you four years from now.
[01:15:49.660 --> 01:15:50.660]   Okay.
[01:15:50.660 --> 01:15:53.260]   Anything you say on the internet can bite you in time.
[01:15:53.260 --> 01:15:54.260]   Now we know we know.
[01:15:54.260 --> 01:15:55.900]   We should have known that from day.
[01:15:55.900 --> 01:15:56.900]   I don't know.
[01:15:56.900 --> 01:15:57.900]   Yes.
[01:15:57.900 --> 01:15:58.900]   No, no, absolutely.
[01:15:58.900 --> 01:16:00.380]   But that's but that's the point.
[01:16:00.380 --> 01:16:02.140]   But that's that is the point about context collapse.
[01:16:02.140 --> 01:16:06.780]   And that's it's worth reading that article because she explains it in that when we started
[01:16:06.780 --> 01:16:11.060]   blogging, when we started to, we started using these things in our head, we were talking
[01:16:11.060 --> 01:16:15.100]   to the four or five other people who we were talking to and who were talking to us.
[01:16:15.100 --> 01:16:19.860]   And it was easier to do it in public than it was to do it in private just because that's
[01:16:19.860 --> 01:16:20.860]   how this is set up.
[01:16:20.860 --> 01:16:25.340]   And that's down to technology is like me not thinking about it much.
[01:16:25.340 --> 01:16:31.340]   And the reason Snapchat took off in the first place was it didn't do that.
[01:16:31.340 --> 01:16:33.940]   It erased everything after 36 of the people had seen it.
[01:16:33.940 --> 01:16:38.440]   And they had to go away and invent this stories thing that lost like 24 hours rather than
[01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:40.240]   10 minutes.
[01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:43.660]   So they could actually have something they could sell to advertisers.
[01:16:43.660 --> 01:16:48.280]   And that is that is part of the challenge of this.
[01:16:48.280 --> 01:16:50.580]   The other challenge I think we're talking about.
[01:16:50.580 --> 01:16:54.300]   One of the things Quinn says is is sorry.
[01:16:54.300 --> 01:17:00.780]   One of the ones law that Quinn proposed is that everything on the internet is either
[01:17:00.780 --> 01:17:01.780]   deleted or permanent.
[01:17:01.780 --> 01:17:05.540]   It's either deleted or public.
[01:17:05.540 --> 01:17:07.500]   Those are the two states things tend towards.
[01:17:07.500 --> 01:17:12.100]   And that's come back and been a problem for her.
[01:17:12.100 --> 01:17:17.100]   But it's, I find it frustrating because I've known Quinn a long time.
[01:17:17.100 --> 01:17:21.220]   She has written some of the best journalism about the internet of anyone.
[01:17:21.220 --> 01:17:25.180]   And she would have been an asset to the New York Times.
[01:17:25.180 --> 01:17:30.260]   And yes, she's always had this liminal process where she goes and disappears into these strange
[01:17:30.260 --> 01:17:31.260]   play.
[01:17:31.260 --> 01:17:35.100]   And she comes back with makes sense a little.
[01:17:35.100 --> 01:17:36.100]   Thank you.
[01:17:36.100 --> 01:17:37.300]   I'm glad that we had you on.
[01:17:37.300 --> 01:17:40.820]   I think that we needed that defense, frankly.
[01:17:40.820 --> 01:17:48.140]   Well, what's really frustrating and this is editorial board versus the newsroom, but
[01:17:48.140 --> 01:17:54.860]   taking her and firing her and leaving someone like Glenn Thrush who is a documented sexual
[01:17:54.860 --> 01:18:00.220]   harasser, you feel kind of like, wow, okay, no.
[01:18:00.220 --> 01:18:05.500]   So that's that I saw that and I was like, oh.
[01:18:05.500 --> 01:18:06.500]   Yeah.
[01:18:06.500 --> 01:18:12.780]   Well, the good news is according to the CEO of the New York Times, print journalism only
[01:18:12.780 --> 01:18:13.780]   has another decade.
[01:18:13.780 --> 01:18:16.780]   And then it's over.
[01:18:16.780 --> 01:18:21.380]   Let me get to my amped up emails.
[01:18:21.380 --> 01:18:27.580]   Actually, the time's doing really well, almost a billion dollars in revenue from subscriptions.
[01:18:27.580 --> 01:18:29.540]   It's which is really laudable.
[01:18:29.540 --> 01:18:30.540]   It's amazing.
[01:18:30.540 --> 01:18:31.540]   Yeah.
[01:18:31.540 --> 01:18:32.540]   A million dollars in some revenue.
[01:18:32.540 --> 01:18:34.460]   Yeah, it's not great.
[01:18:34.460 --> 01:18:38.860]   So I think what Mark Thompson, who's CEO of the New York Times says is saying is that
[01:18:38.860 --> 01:18:42.660]   the print version doesn't have a lot longer.
[01:18:42.660 --> 01:18:46.500]   Many, many years ago, many years ago, I heard Arthur Salzberger say it in a bit where I
[01:18:46.500 --> 01:18:49.220]   was he said, you know, I could get rid of a billion dollars cost tomorrow.
[01:18:49.220 --> 01:18:53.380]   Yeah, just a print, but I get rid of a billion dollars revenue with it.
[01:18:53.380 --> 01:18:57.400]   And so now with the FT and the times you start to see where you have a sustainable business
[01:18:57.400 --> 01:19:00.420]   and digital and but let's be clear.
[01:19:00.420 --> 01:19:03.500]   These are exceptional properties, exceptional brands.
[01:19:03.500 --> 01:19:07.840]   It's not going to be it's not going to be the, you know, the metropolis daily disgrace does
[01:19:07.840 --> 01:19:10.120]   not live under the same economics and scale.
[01:19:10.120 --> 01:19:14.180]   Well, and I think you can thank Donald Trump for some of the success of the post and the
[01:19:14.180 --> 01:19:15.180]   times.
[01:19:15.180 --> 01:19:17.940]   And I wonder if times settle down.
[01:19:17.940 --> 01:19:22.100]   People will lose interest in reading the news and and all of those digital subscriptions
[01:19:22.100 --> 01:19:23.100]   may evaporate.
[01:19:23.100 --> 01:19:25.820]   I feel like a lot of five subscriptions.
[01:19:25.820 --> 01:19:27.820]   Go ahead, please.
[01:19:27.820 --> 01:19:32.840]   Oh, I was going to say the times has done a nice job of rounding out their coverage.
[01:19:32.840 --> 01:19:38.400]   And they've got their hard hitting actual journalism and then they've got got how many
[01:19:38.400 --> 01:19:42.840]   of you maybe is because I'm a woman, but I get constantly those smarter living stories.
[01:19:42.840 --> 01:19:45.080]   They're just pitched to me all the darn time.
[01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:47.440]   Like in some of them are really interesting.
[01:19:47.440 --> 01:19:53.520]   And then they've got their whole food effort that's a subscription model for recipes.
[01:19:53.520 --> 01:19:59.120]   And I just think they're getting a little savvier about how they package what they do
[01:19:59.120 --> 01:20:03.040]   and how they define what they do.
[01:20:03.040 --> 01:20:04.720]   I think that's all true.
[01:20:04.720 --> 01:20:07.700]   But and I've been saying this for quite a while.
[01:20:07.700 --> 01:20:09.520]   My friend, Jay Rosen, has said it recently.
[01:20:09.520 --> 01:20:10.520]   Others have said it recently.
[01:20:10.520 --> 01:20:13.560]   I actually start the day with the Washington Post now.
[01:20:13.560 --> 01:20:14.480]   I think it's.
[01:20:14.480 --> 01:20:19.840]   Well, that's the I guess that's the point is that whether it's a Trump bump or not, there's
[01:20:19.840 --> 01:20:22.160]   an opportunity now for for these.
[01:20:22.160 --> 01:20:23.160]   Yes.
[01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:28.920]   It's publications to prove themselves in digital and make themselves invaluable regardless
[01:20:28.920 --> 01:20:31.880]   of the current story of the day.
[01:20:31.880 --> 01:20:37.000]   And so at least they have an opportunity.
[01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:42.600]   This by the way, I'm reading this article by Quinn in this this medium piece.
[01:20:42.600 --> 01:20:43.880]   It's brilliant.
[01:20:43.880 --> 01:20:45.200]   You're absolutely right.
[01:20:45.200 --> 01:20:47.400]   And and it's very timely.
[01:20:47.400 --> 01:20:49.320]   There's a four-parter.
[01:20:49.320 --> 01:20:53.280]   Even though it was written in like 2013, it couldn't be more timely.
[01:20:53.280 --> 01:20:57.680]   In some ways it was prescient and people should read it.
[01:20:57.680 --> 01:21:02.000]   And then and now I really feel like the times actually that was a big loss.
[01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:06.200]   It's this it's this way as soon as you see a firestorm, you just think, oh my God, give
[01:21:06.200 --> 01:21:07.200]   me the hose.
[01:21:07.200 --> 01:21:08.200]   Step away from it.
[01:21:08.200 --> 01:21:11.640]   Yeah, we can't afford to any more controversy.
[01:21:11.640 --> 01:21:13.480]   But you make an excellent point, Stacy.
[01:21:13.480 --> 01:21:15.680]   Steping away from Thrush.
[01:21:15.680 --> 01:21:20.960]   Well, and they're they're I get very frustrated with the times because they will back people
[01:21:20.960 --> 01:21:23.560]   and things that I'm like, really?
[01:21:23.560 --> 01:21:28.800]   And then to have something like this happen, you're like, huh, what does that say about
[01:21:28.800 --> 01:21:31.680]   their priorities and who they're willing to protect?
[01:21:31.680 --> 01:21:34.800]   And that to me speaks a lot.
[01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:41.800]   And it's unsurprising, but grr, grr, grr, grr, grr, grr.
[01:21:41.800 --> 01:21:42.800]   Let's see.
[01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:43.800]   Let's do a little Facebook.
[01:21:43.800 --> 01:21:44.800]   What do you say?
[01:21:44.800 --> 01:21:47.280]   Let's let's let's make Jeff uncomfortable.
[01:21:47.280 --> 01:21:50.400]   No, no, no, no, no.
[01:21:50.400 --> 01:21:57.040]   Facebook slowing that a little bit lost around 2.8 million US users under 25 last year.
[01:21:57.040 --> 01:21:59.200]   Mark Zuckerberg kind of acknowledged it.
[01:21:59.200 --> 01:22:07.280]   They some of it is the modification of the, you know, the news feed.
[01:22:07.280 --> 01:22:12.280]   This is from e-marketer, but they see according to e-marketer Facebook is losing young users
[01:22:12.280 --> 01:22:16.000]   even quicker than expected.
[01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:19.000]   That may just because their grandparents are on there and you can't post stuff for your
[01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:20.000]   grandparents to see.
[01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:21.000]   No, yeah.
[01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:22.000]   Well, it's so interesting.
[01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:31.400]   I mean, this stuff can change in a turn on a dime and that's the collapse part.
[01:22:31.400 --> 01:22:34.680]   Did you all read the 11,000 word wire piece?
[01:22:34.680 --> 01:22:35.680]   Sorry, Kevin.
[01:22:35.680 --> 01:22:41.080]   11,000 word wire piece with Mark Zuckerberg's picture on the front of all beat up.
[01:22:41.080 --> 01:22:42.080]   Yes.
[01:22:42.080 --> 01:22:48.080]   I did not because I was out of my wired subscriptions, darn it, or my free wired articles and I'm
[01:22:48.080 --> 01:22:49.080]   still debating the.
[01:22:49.080 --> 01:22:50.600]   I paid the 20 bucks.
[01:22:50.600 --> 01:22:52.080]   I paid it.
[01:22:52.080 --> 01:22:54.360]   I said, you know, annually annually.
[01:22:54.360 --> 01:22:55.360]   It's not that expensive.
[01:22:55.360 --> 01:22:56.360]   Oh, okay.
[01:22:56.360 --> 01:22:57.360]   I can.
[01:22:57.360 --> 01:22:58.360]   Okay.
[01:22:58.360 --> 01:22:59.360]   Twenty five.
[01:22:59.360 --> 01:23:00.360]   Twenty five.
[01:23:00.360 --> 01:23:01.360]   Whatever.
[01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:02.360]   It's it's it's it's and you get the paper magazine.
[01:23:02.360 --> 01:23:03.360]   You know what?
[01:23:03.360 --> 01:23:06.640]   I just I talked about it on Sunday and when I found out it was so inexpensive, I said,
[01:23:06.640 --> 01:23:07.640]   no, they deserve.
[01:23:07.640 --> 01:23:08.640]   They're doing.
[01:23:08.640 --> 01:23:09.640]   I'll do.
[01:23:09.640 --> 01:23:10.640]   I'll give them that.
[01:23:10.640 --> 01:23:11.640]   Yeah.
[01:23:11.640 --> 01:23:13.680]   They deserve 20 bucks.
[01:23:13.680 --> 01:23:14.680]   You know what can help them?
[01:23:14.680 --> 01:23:15.680]   We were sorry.
[01:23:15.680 --> 01:23:17.680]   Oh, we talked last week.
[01:23:17.680 --> 01:23:19.680]   We were talking to each other.
[01:23:19.680 --> 01:23:21.680]   I just know I talked over.
[01:23:21.680 --> 01:23:26.440]   Kevin, Skype is not Skype is not doing a good job right now and I apologize to all who
[01:23:26.440 --> 01:23:27.920]   are listening that we're just having lots of stuff.
[01:23:27.920 --> 01:23:29.440]   Yeah, we're not doing this on purpose folks.
[01:23:29.440 --> 01:23:30.440]   Yeah.
[01:23:30.440 --> 01:23:31.440]   Here's a picture.
[01:23:31.440 --> 01:23:35.840]   Kevin, we last week talked about the subscription model and what we would pay for.
[01:23:35.840 --> 01:23:40.400]   Maybe it was two weeks ago and Jeff was saying that now when he's asked to pay for an article,
[01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:44.040]   he tallied it all up and it was like almost three thousand dollars.
[01:23:44.040 --> 01:23:46.600]   Yeah, it's their bore of thirty six hundred.
[01:23:46.600 --> 01:23:51.680]   But I had this brilliant idea for how publishers could like make this less onerous.
[01:23:51.680 --> 01:23:55.560]   You know how you could always get airline miles and trade them in for magazines?
[01:23:55.560 --> 01:23:57.800]   Why can't I do that for digital subscription?
[01:23:57.800 --> 01:23:59.800]   There you go.
[01:23:59.800 --> 01:24:01.560]   I take something that's in your life worth this.
[01:24:01.560 --> 01:24:03.560]   That's actually a great idea.
[01:24:03.560 --> 01:24:04.560]   Here's why.
[01:24:04.560 --> 01:24:05.560]   Here's why.
[01:24:05.560 --> 01:24:09.000]   Because they just wanted circulation for advertising.
[01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:11.800]   In the case of the digital, you don't have that back.
[01:24:11.800 --> 01:24:16.760]   So the stamp sheets, when I was in the magazine business, we would lose money on circulation
[01:24:16.760 --> 01:24:20.480]   revenue because we gained it back on advertising that's no longer the case.
[01:24:20.480 --> 01:24:23.160]   So I wish that were the case Stacey, but I'll.
[01:24:23.160 --> 01:24:25.520]   Digital fixes that though, doesn't rock that dream.
[01:24:25.520 --> 01:24:29.360]   Doesn't digital help because the production costs are much lower, aren't they?
[01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:31.080]   But the advertising revenue is just not there.
[01:24:31.080 --> 01:24:33.160]   But also the economic magazines.
[01:24:33.160 --> 01:24:34.160]   Yeah.
[01:24:34.160 --> 01:24:40.440]   Just try to find out.
[01:24:40.440 --> 01:24:43.840]   Well, also, they will give you a.
[01:24:43.840 --> 01:24:48.600]   But you just find your subscription for am I was because if you were the kind of person
[01:24:48.600 --> 01:24:51.600]   who had a mouse, you were the kind of person that advertisers wanted to.
[01:24:51.600 --> 01:24:54.280]   So there was a there was a class thing in that as well.
[01:24:54.280 --> 01:24:58.560]   So this article by Nicholas Thompson and Fred Vogelstein.
[01:24:58.560 --> 01:25:01.120]   Fred, didn't he write the book?
[01:25:01.120 --> 01:25:03.120]   Why do I know his name?
[01:25:03.120 --> 01:25:04.120]   It's a thousand words.
[01:25:04.120 --> 01:25:07.080]   Summarize if you would in five, Jeff.
[01:25:07.080 --> 01:25:10.160]   For those of us who've gone through our five articles of the month.
[01:25:10.160 --> 01:25:12.000]   I mean, generally what we.
[01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:13.000]   No, it's the TikTok.
[01:25:13.000 --> 01:25:15.200]   We've been covering this month after month.
[01:25:15.200 --> 01:25:18.320]   This is the stories we've been covering for the last two years.
[01:25:18.320 --> 01:25:23.280]   It's the TikTok about, oh my God, we've got a problem here at Houston.
[01:25:23.280 --> 01:25:25.000]   We have a problem.
[01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.600]   And we have it with Russian trolls.
[01:25:27.600 --> 01:25:29.520]   We have it with manipulation of the news.
[01:25:29.520 --> 01:25:37.080]   We have it with instability on the platform and what they've done to try to wake up to
[01:25:37.080 --> 01:25:38.320]   that and with the news business.
[01:25:38.320 --> 01:25:40.120]   And so it's going through that.
[01:25:40.120 --> 01:25:45.120]   I gotta say the thing that shocked me most in the piece was not about Facebook, but about
[01:25:45.120 --> 01:25:46.120]   a news corp.
[01:25:46.120 --> 01:25:47.120]   Oh, yeah.
[01:25:47.120 --> 01:25:50.400]   That was so slimy doing the sexual predator thing.
[01:25:50.400 --> 01:25:59.480]   Yeah, where it alleges that news corp lawyers made up sexual predation instances and can
[01:25:59.480 --> 01:26:02.920]   planes in order to go after Facebook.
[01:26:02.920 --> 01:26:05.400]   That's just a journalistic organization.
[01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:06.400]   That's true.
[01:26:06.400 --> 01:26:08.720]   Why has somebody else picked up that story and run with it?
[01:26:08.720 --> 01:26:09.720]   It's just shocking.
[01:26:09.720 --> 01:26:14.200]   It's kind of like a three-texting story a few years ago.
[01:26:14.200 --> 01:26:15.200]   This is ridiculous.
[01:26:15.200 --> 01:26:16.200]   Yeah.
[01:26:16.200 --> 01:26:19.800]   I'm sure some organization is trying to pick up and report that out.
[01:26:19.800 --> 01:26:21.680]   I mean, Wired has fact-checking.
[01:26:21.680 --> 01:26:27.680]   So I'm sure that went through something because otherwise, Murdoch will sue the pants off
[01:26:27.680 --> 01:26:28.680]   to them.
[01:26:28.680 --> 01:26:33.400]   Well, worth reading then, it sounds like this 11,000 word article.
[01:26:33.400 --> 01:26:35.200]   It's going to be good.
[01:26:35.200 --> 01:26:37.160]   As Kevin said, we've been covering it here on the show.
[01:26:37.160 --> 01:26:38.160]   It's straight through.
[01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:40.000]   So I don't think it was anything that's wise.
[01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:41.600]   We didn't know that stuff.
[01:26:41.600 --> 01:26:42.600]   Wow.
[01:26:42.600 --> 01:26:46.320]   Well, and I mean, these articles take months to report out.
[01:26:46.320 --> 01:26:49.800]   This is, you know, the same time we were talking about this, they were also talking about
[01:26:49.800 --> 01:26:50.800]   it.
[01:26:50.800 --> 01:26:51.800]   They just have to wait to get it into print.
[01:26:51.800 --> 01:26:52.880]   Oh, I know what Fred wrote.
[01:26:52.880 --> 01:26:54.600]   He wrote Dogfight.
[01:26:54.600 --> 01:26:55.880]   That was a great book.
[01:26:55.880 --> 01:26:56.880]   Highly recommended.
[01:26:56.880 --> 01:26:58.880]   That's how it's written.
[01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:01.960]   How awful it will went to war and started revolution.
[01:27:01.960 --> 01:27:02.960]   Yes.
[01:27:02.960 --> 01:27:04.280]   That was a fantastic book.
[01:27:04.280 --> 01:27:06.000]   Well, deeply researched.
[01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:07.000]   So yeah, all right.
[01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.400]   It was a good one.
[01:27:09.400 --> 01:27:10.400]   Yeah.
[01:27:10.400 --> 01:27:11.400]   Yeah.
[01:27:11.400 --> 01:27:12.400]   But it makes sense.
[01:27:12.400 --> 01:27:15.040]   Murdoch and Facebook, no love lost.
[01:27:15.040 --> 01:27:21.280]   I mean, the, in fact, all publishers are kind of at this point threatened by Facebook,
[01:27:21.280 --> 01:27:22.280]   right?
[01:27:22.280 --> 01:27:23.280]   Yeah.
[01:27:23.280 --> 01:27:26.840]   I went to a roundtable last week where it wasn't as hostile.
[01:27:26.840 --> 01:27:29.880]   I thought it was going to be, but it's very wary.
[01:27:29.880 --> 01:27:35.560]   Campbell Brown, who's in charge of Facebook journalism project appeared with Adam Masari,
[01:27:35.560 --> 01:27:39.080]   who's the head of news feed at code.
[01:27:39.080 --> 01:27:40.360]   And they're talking tough.
[01:27:40.360 --> 01:27:43.960]   They're just saying, you know, to Murdoch and company, if you don't want to be on Facebook,
[01:27:43.960 --> 01:27:44.960]   don't be on Facebook.
[01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:45.960]   It's okay.
[01:27:45.960 --> 01:27:51.600]   But they're saying our first job is to our users and to a good experience on Facebook.
[01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:59.120]   I think that there is an opportunity for us in the news business.
[01:27:59.120 --> 01:28:00.120]   What happened?
[01:28:00.120 --> 01:28:03.480]   I can't, I said this before, probably very quick.
[01:28:03.480 --> 01:28:07.040]   What happened was Facebook saw things in very blunt terms.
[01:28:07.040 --> 01:28:10.640]   They saw social content and public content and public content was everything from the
[01:28:10.640 --> 01:28:15.240]   New York Times to Vladimir's horrible Russian blog.
[01:28:15.240 --> 01:28:19.160]   And when Vladimir got them in trouble, they threw out the entire bathwater.
[01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:22.240]   And now they're bringing back the babies of the New York Times and the Washington Post
[01:28:22.240 --> 01:28:25.040]   and foreign affairs and wired and whatever.
[01:28:25.040 --> 01:28:28.040]   When that gets done, when they figure out how to do that, and they have not figured out
[01:28:28.040 --> 01:28:33.120]   how to do that, but when they do, I think there's an opportunity for quality news to
[01:28:33.120 --> 01:28:35.600]   be more alone on Facebook and be better off.
[01:28:35.600 --> 01:28:38.040]   But we'll see.
[01:28:38.040 --> 01:28:45.480]   Well, yeah, well, you know, with my indie web hat on, I'm saying yes.
[01:28:45.480 --> 01:28:50.000]   Do not assume that Facebook is your friend, make sure you have a website, use Facebook
[01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:55.200]   as a place to publish links that go to your website and if Facebook starts charging you
[01:28:55.200 --> 01:28:58.040]   to access your customers, you've still got your customers.
[01:28:58.040 --> 01:29:06.120]   But that's been a long sort of slow popboarding that Facebook's been doing to the news people.
[01:29:06.120 --> 01:29:11.440]   And they did spend a lot of time wooing them and encouraging to do things and giving them
[01:29:11.440 --> 01:29:12.680]   preferential treatment.
[01:29:12.680 --> 01:29:14.840]   Now they're doing the opposite.
[01:29:14.840 --> 01:29:20.400]   And part of that is, you know, part of what we got from that very long, wide piece was
[01:29:20.400 --> 01:29:23.840]   that Zuckerberg is now convinced he actually has a problem and that they sort of they
[01:29:23.840 --> 01:29:26.760]   triangulate on that three different direction.
[01:29:26.760 --> 01:29:32.080]   And they now believe he sees this as an existential threat and he wants to change things and
[01:29:32.080 --> 01:29:36.280]   he wants to move Facebook back to the cozy place for talking to your friends and not
[01:29:36.280 --> 01:29:39.560]   the place where you discuss news articles.
[01:29:39.560 --> 01:29:43.920]   The article says that Facebook's finally acknowledged that we're a platform.
[01:29:43.920 --> 01:29:46.840]   We've always said we're a platform, but yeah, I guess we have some of the responsibilities
[01:29:46.840 --> 01:29:50.240]   that Publisher does as well.
[01:29:50.240 --> 01:29:56.560]   Yeah, my problem is I think that Facebook is still nascent and that they're definitely,
[01:29:56.560 --> 01:30:00.400]   I said wrote this in a post two weeks ago, that their definition of community as conversation
[01:30:00.400 --> 01:30:06.520]   is still fairly shallow and temporal and they've got to think at much deeper level about what
[01:30:06.520 --> 01:30:11.280]   it means to bring communities together and why they come together and understand that.
[01:30:11.280 --> 01:30:15.480]   And I think that the problem is I think that when you start a platform, you think, okay,
[01:30:15.480 --> 01:30:16.480]   that's it.
[01:30:16.480 --> 01:30:17.480]   It's done.
[01:30:17.480 --> 01:30:18.640]   Now we'll learn everything we can possibly learn from the data we have.
[01:30:18.640 --> 01:30:22.520]   Well, no, it's limited by the tools you give people and the context you give them and the
[01:30:22.520 --> 01:30:23.920]   architecture you create.
[01:30:23.920 --> 01:30:24.920]   Yes, exactly.
[01:30:24.920 --> 01:30:30.920]   Facebook actually announced yesterday that they're going to allow paywalls inside Facebook,
[01:30:30.920 --> 01:30:34.960]   at least in their iOS app, sounds like it's a test or an experiment.
[01:30:34.960 --> 01:30:41.240]   Is this kind of giving into publishers and saying, okay, yeah.
[01:30:41.240 --> 01:30:47.560]   As the Wired story said, Zock has always been against paywalls, but other people, the
[01:30:47.560 --> 01:30:51.080]   company said, this is so critically important in news companies, you got to do it.
[01:30:51.080 --> 01:30:57.160]   And meanwhile, Google took down its first click free and it's becoming friendly to pay
[01:30:57.160 --> 01:30:58.160]   walls.
[01:30:58.160 --> 01:30:59.160]   So they both just had to.
[01:30:59.160 --> 01:31:00.160]   They just had to.
[01:31:00.160 --> 01:31:01.360]   Not something they ever wanted.
[01:31:01.360 --> 01:31:05.760]   Well, AMP has a paywall component now as well, which is the other part of this.
[01:31:05.760 --> 01:31:10.800]   Yeah, the other thing that was interesting and it was in one of Jeff's number links,
[01:31:10.800 --> 01:31:13.000]   but oh, yeah, now it's okay.
[01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:14.000]   It's okay.
[01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:15.000]   It's fake.
[01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:16.000]   I'm going to try to put it in 10 minutes anyway.
[01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:19.000]   So we'll wrap it up soon.
[01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:20.000]   Okay.
[01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:26.360]   So this is the Facebook put this thing out saying, we want community leaders who use
[01:31:26.360 --> 01:31:30.400]   Facebook and we'll give you money and we'll give five of you a million pounds, a million
[01:31:30.400 --> 01:31:35.560]   dollars and you can come to Facebook once a month and we'll give you another set of
[01:31:35.560 --> 01:31:43.520]   you $50,000 and give you benefits and basically they realize is that the the tumbler, the person
[01:31:43.520 --> 01:31:47.000]   who is valuable, which is that is a sea change for them.
[01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:48.720]   That is actually very significant.
[01:31:48.720 --> 01:31:51.920]   I doesn't mean they're not going to screw it up and it doesn't mean they're not going
[01:31:51.920 --> 01:31:56.280]   to say, well, obviously this should all be inside Facebook and actually maintain a community
[01:31:56.280 --> 01:31:57.640]   across multiple systems.
[01:31:57.640 --> 01:31:59.040]   It doesn't make sense.
[01:31:59.040 --> 01:32:03.760]   But for me, that was a market that they actually realized we've been missing this for
[01:32:03.760 --> 01:32:04.760]   a while.
[01:32:04.760 --> 01:32:12.520]   So Leo, you remember that Deb and Heather and I were talking about this five or six years
[01:32:12.520 --> 01:32:18.760]   ago on this network trying to say this is the important part and it's taken that long
[01:32:18.760 --> 01:32:25.220]   for this to come to come through, which is that the important thing is having someone
[01:32:25.220 --> 01:32:31.520]   human there who is moderating the community, making sure that things make sense and making
[01:32:31.520 --> 01:32:33.760]   sure that is a community and not an algorithm.
[01:32:33.760 --> 01:32:38.480]   And that is the missing piece that Facebook maybe is starting to realize they need.
[01:32:38.480 --> 01:32:40.480]   How can you scale that though?
[01:32:40.480 --> 01:32:46.080]   How many tumblers are they going to need if they have a billion and a half users?
[01:32:46.080 --> 01:32:48.480]   That's a lot of tumbling.
[01:32:48.480 --> 01:32:51.160]   Well, that's part of the point.
[01:32:51.160 --> 01:32:57.440]   But part of the point is that if you say there are millions of communities on Facebook
[01:32:57.440 --> 01:33:00.000]   and we haven't been thinking about them as communities, been thinking about them as inputs
[01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:01.200]   to an algorithm.
[01:33:01.200 --> 01:33:06.400]   If we step back and say if we think of them as communities as subgroups, the people are
[01:33:06.400 --> 01:33:12.600]   in charge of, if you think about that as the place you want to do and not as an input to
[01:33:12.600 --> 01:33:17.560]   an algorithm and a source of things that should be selling advertising, which is what happens.
[01:33:17.560 --> 01:33:21.840]   You create media on Facebook and it says, "Ha ha, we've hidden it from 75% of the people
[01:33:21.840 --> 01:33:25.640]   who thought they were following you and if you've charged them."
[01:33:25.640 --> 01:33:26.640]   You just invented Google Plus.
[01:33:26.640 --> 01:33:33.640]   Plus, they've been paid for this for a while.
[01:33:33.640 --> 01:33:35.640]   Well, why?
[01:33:35.640 --> 01:33:36.640]   Congratulations.
[01:33:36.640 --> 01:33:39.440]   Actually, I think you probably added this to the rundown.
[01:33:39.440 --> 01:33:45.000]   The creator of Drupal, Dries Boudtart, has actually said, "I'm pulling my Facebook application
[01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:49.480]   from my phone and he talks about the indie web movement and posse, which we've talked
[01:33:49.480 --> 01:33:54.480]   about before, which is published on your own site, Syndicate Elsewhere, or pesos, which
[01:33:54.480 --> 01:33:58.800]   I, as an e-act acronym I hadn't heard before, publish Elsewhere, syndicate to your own
[01:33:58.800 --> 01:33:59.800]   site."
[01:33:59.800 --> 01:34:00.800]   Who?
[01:34:00.800 --> 01:34:01.800]   I do both.
[01:34:01.800 --> 01:34:02.800]   You're a peso and a posse.
[01:34:02.800 --> 01:34:03.800]   Yes.
[01:34:03.800 --> 01:34:05.640]   A lot of us do both.
[01:34:05.640 --> 01:34:09.640]   Part of it is it depends a lot on ease of tooling.
[01:34:09.640 --> 01:34:13.000]   For something like Instagram, it's easier to post on Instagram because they've got a pretty
[01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.120]   good app on your phone.
[01:34:15.120 --> 01:34:16.560]   Then you can draw it back.
[01:34:16.560 --> 01:34:20.000]   There's a site called Own Your Gram that you've already created.
[01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:21.000]   Really love it.
[01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:24.840]   Post it back to your own website as well.
[01:34:24.840 --> 01:34:27.680]   You can build tools that work in both directions.
[01:34:27.680 --> 01:34:30.880]   The point is you want to think about both.
[01:34:30.880 --> 01:34:35.560]   Part of this, pitching this to Jeff as well, part of this is to go to the news people and
[01:34:35.560 --> 01:34:43.240]   the publishers and the community group people and say, "Don't assume that one site has
[01:34:43.240 --> 01:34:47.480]   an engagement and advertising model is actually going to do what you want them to do because
[01:34:47.480 --> 01:34:50.920]   at some point they will flip the switch on you and start charging you to talk to your
[01:34:50.920 --> 01:34:52.320]   friends.
[01:34:52.320 --> 01:34:54.800]   Think about how you can use them as well.
[01:34:54.800 --> 01:34:58.960]   They're valuable but they don't have entire ownership of everything you make."
[01:34:58.960 --> 01:35:02.960]   There's a sort of question of India where that's it.
[01:35:02.960 --> 01:35:05.320]   But it doesn't just apply to individuals which is where we came from.
[01:35:05.320 --> 01:35:11.400]   It does apply to publishers, organizations and groups as well.
[01:35:11.400 --> 01:35:14.320]   Let's say Jeff turns into a pumpkin in moments.
[01:35:14.320 --> 01:35:20.880]   Let's wrap up the show as we often do with picks and numbers.
[01:35:20.880 --> 01:35:22.880]   I'm going to let Stacey go first.
[01:35:22.880 --> 01:35:24.440]   Don't make me go first because my name is...
[01:35:24.440 --> 01:35:25.920]   I'm not going to let Stacey go first.
[01:35:25.920 --> 01:35:26.920]   I have to set it up.
[01:35:26.920 --> 01:35:27.920]   So I'll just give her a couple of minutes.
[01:35:27.920 --> 01:35:30.120]   Stacey has to go set up her mirror.
[01:35:30.120 --> 01:35:31.880]   First Jeff Jarvis and his number of the...
[01:35:31.880 --> 01:35:32.880]   What was I going to do?
[01:35:32.880 --> 01:35:33.880]   Which one was I going to do?
[01:35:33.880 --> 01:35:34.880]   Uh oh.
[01:35:34.880 --> 01:35:36.880]   Let's go to Kevin Marks.
[01:35:36.880 --> 01:35:37.880]   I got it.
[01:35:37.880 --> 01:35:38.880]   I got it.
[01:35:38.880 --> 01:35:39.880]   Go ahead.
[01:35:39.880 --> 01:35:40.880]   Kevin, you go ahead.
[01:35:40.880 --> 01:35:41.880]   Kevin Marks fritter.
[01:35:41.880 --> 01:35:42.880]   Get your confesses.
[01:35:42.880 --> 01:35:44.600]   All right, Jeff, go first.
[01:35:44.600 --> 01:35:45.600]   Don't fight folks.
[01:35:45.600 --> 01:35:50.360]   All right, a couple who met some years ago on Twitter are going to get married and they're
[01:35:50.360 --> 01:35:53.960]   going to do their vows in 280 characters at Twitter.
[01:35:53.960 --> 01:35:57.160]   Oh my God.
[01:35:57.160 --> 01:36:01.320]   And now I know why Twitter stocks been going through the roof.
[01:36:01.320 --> 01:36:02.320]   Simon Savage.
[01:36:02.320 --> 01:36:04.520]   It's an open air proposal thing, but for Twitter, okay.
[01:36:04.520 --> 01:36:05.600]   Yeah, that's cute.
[01:36:05.600 --> 01:36:07.320]   Do they say what their vows will be?
[01:36:07.320 --> 01:36:08.320]   Or is this...
[01:36:08.320 --> 01:36:09.320]   I don't know.
[01:36:09.320 --> 01:36:13.840]   It says that they learned that they had a common interest in cheese and beards.
[01:36:13.840 --> 01:36:16.080]   Cheese and beards.
[01:36:16.080 --> 01:36:17.080]   Not beer.
[01:36:17.080 --> 01:36:18.080]   Beard.
[01:36:18.080 --> 01:36:19.080]   Beard.
[01:36:19.080 --> 01:36:20.080]   This is a...
[01:36:20.080 --> 01:36:21.080]   Pursuit gentleman.
[01:36:21.080 --> 01:36:23.080]   All right, that's cute.
[01:36:23.080 --> 01:36:24.080]   That's sweet.
[01:36:24.080 --> 01:36:26.080]   It'll be the Twitter office in London.
[01:36:26.080 --> 01:36:27.080]   Yeah.
[01:36:27.080 --> 01:36:28.080]   That's cute.
[01:36:28.080 --> 01:36:30.480]   This is not new, is it?
[01:36:30.480 --> 01:36:33.240]   Christina Warren was prepared to do on Twitter.
[01:36:33.240 --> 01:36:34.520]   But they didn't meet on Twitter.
[01:36:34.520 --> 01:36:38.080]   She'd known her fiance for some time, I think.
[01:36:38.080 --> 01:36:40.280]   280 character wedding vows.
[01:36:40.280 --> 01:36:43.040]   I think more than long enough.
[01:36:43.040 --> 01:36:44.640]   Yes, I think so too.
[01:36:44.640 --> 01:36:47.960]   I think this is a blessing.
[01:36:47.960 --> 01:36:50.720]   Who says Twitter's not done good things for the world?
[01:36:50.720 --> 01:36:55.320]   You have an odd URL in your pick, Kevin Marks.
[01:36:55.320 --> 01:36:56.320]   You better explain.
[01:36:56.320 --> 01:36:57.320]   I do.
[01:36:57.320 --> 01:36:58.320]   Let's explain this.
[01:36:58.320 --> 01:37:01.720]   Well, this is the question.
[01:37:01.720 --> 01:37:02.720]   Okay.
[01:37:02.720 --> 01:37:05.760]   You need to instill beaker.
[01:37:05.760 --> 01:37:07.960]   You can do this later while I'm explaining.
[01:37:07.960 --> 01:37:10.800]   Or I can try screen sharing, but that's always fun here.
[01:37:10.800 --> 01:37:12.520]   I'll do it.
[01:37:12.520 --> 01:37:13.680]   Okay.
[01:37:13.680 --> 01:37:21.240]   So this is another sort of indie web kind of approach, but it's one of these decentralized
[01:37:21.240 --> 01:37:29.800]   web ideas where they say, you're trying to replace the upper layers of the web.
[01:37:29.800 --> 01:37:31.880]   We're trying to place the lower layers as well.
[01:37:31.880 --> 01:37:40.360]   So what they say is instead of having DNS and URLs and things like that, and HTTP will
[01:37:40.360 --> 01:37:45.280]   have another protocol called that, which is basically a file sharing protocol that
[01:37:45.280 --> 01:37:48.720]   works between sites.
[01:37:48.720 --> 01:37:53.160]   So instead of having a domain name, you have an ugly looking hash thing.
[01:37:53.160 --> 01:37:55.120]   So I have the beaker.
[01:37:55.120 --> 01:37:58.600]   This is the browser to show you this technology, right?
[01:37:58.600 --> 01:38:03.560]   So is beaker must be the code base must be WebKit or something.
[01:38:03.560 --> 01:38:06.240]   It's something easy, Chrome or something.
[01:38:06.240 --> 01:38:07.240]   It's broadly Chrome.
[01:38:07.240 --> 01:38:08.240]   Yeah.
[01:38:08.240 --> 01:38:09.240]   But they have a new--
[01:38:09.240 --> 01:38:10.240]   Is that the browser?
[01:38:10.240 --> 01:38:11.280]   This is beaker browser.
[01:38:11.280 --> 01:38:15.960]   So I can enter a dat colon hash hash hash.
[01:38:15.960 --> 01:38:16.960]   Yes.
[01:38:16.960 --> 01:38:20.720]   So if you do that colon slash slash--
[01:38:20.720 --> 01:38:22.280]   Fritter.hashbase.io.
[01:38:22.280 --> 01:38:23.280]   I owe.
[01:38:23.280 --> 01:38:26.760]   It's a Twitter clone.
[01:38:26.760 --> 01:38:28.080]   It's a peer to peer app.
[01:38:28.080 --> 01:38:32.120]   So is beaker is now-- what is beaker doing?
[01:38:32.120 --> 01:38:36.880]   Is it sharing my web access with other people?
[01:38:36.880 --> 01:38:43.160]   So what beaker does is the way the data protocol works is it's a distributed file system.
[01:38:43.160 --> 01:38:50.520]   So anything you do publish with a dot.io is shared out in a bit torrent-like way.
[01:38:50.520 --> 01:38:53.480]   So there's a distributed hash table with pieces of it, and you can fetch things that
[01:38:53.480 --> 01:38:54.480]   way.
[01:38:54.480 --> 01:38:59.040]   And the root is a public key.
[01:38:59.040 --> 01:39:02.280]   The people only see that if you're given that public key, and then underneath it you
[01:39:02.280 --> 01:39:03.280]   have a file system.
[01:39:03.280 --> 01:39:06.240]   And you can break a new document and share it.
[01:39:06.240 --> 01:39:07.240]   So I'm putting--
[01:39:07.240 --> 01:39:08.240]   But--
[01:39:08.240 --> 01:39:12.160]   But Fritter is-- it's really the like thing that runs on top of this.
[01:39:12.160 --> 01:39:14.920]   So I am now running Fritter.
[01:39:14.920 --> 01:39:17.480]   It says, create a new site and add it to your library.
[01:39:17.480 --> 01:39:18.640]   Fritter user Leo LePort.
[01:39:18.640 --> 01:39:23.320]   So this becomes-- I'm serving this via-- I'm so confused.
[01:39:23.320 --> 01:39:29.040]   Look, I've somehow created a Twitter with just me.
[01:39:29.040 --> 01:39:30.040]   Now what do I do?
[01:39:30.040 --> 01:39:31.040]   That's right.
[01:39:31.040 --> 01:39:32.440]   Yeah.
[01:39:32.440 --> 01:39:35.640]   And then I've got five peers.
[01:39:35.640 --> 01:39:37.920]   These are my peers.
[01:39:37.920 --> 01:39:39.360]   I'm very confused.
[01:39:39.360 --> 01:39:40.360]   So let's write a post.
[01:39:40.360 --> 01:39:42.240]   You give me the very long that URL.
[01:39:42.240 --> 01:39:43.240]   I follow you.
[01:39:43.240 --> 01:39:45.840]   Oh, really?
[01:39:45.840 --> 01:39:47.360]   That's my URL.
[01:39:47.360 --> 01:39:48.440]   And I'm not serving it.
[01:39:48.440 --> 01:39:52.040]   I'm peer-to-peer sharing it.
[01:39:52.040 --> 01:39:54.440]   Is that right?
[01:39:54.440 --> 01:39:55.960]   Is this decentralized Twitter?
[01:39:55.960 --> 01:39:56.960]   Yes.
[01:39:56.960 --> 01:39:57.960]   Yes.
[01:39:57.960 --> 01:39:58.960]   Oh.
[01:39:58.960 --> 01:39:59.960]   Yes, it is centralized Twitter.
[01:39:59.960 --> 01:40:03.640]   The link address, I don't know what it is.
[01:40:03.640 --> 01:40:04.640]   It's--
[01:40:04.640 --> 01:40:05.880]   Oh, here it is.
[01:40:05.880 --> 01:40:07.960]   Copy your profile URL.
[01:40:07.960 --> 01:40:08.480]   OK.
[01:40:08.480 --> 01:40:09.880]   So I can paste this in.
[01:40:09.880 --> 01:40:10.800]   Oh, it is very long.
[01:40:10.800 --> 01:40:14.200]   It has a hash, basically.
[01:40:14.200 --> 01:40:16.200]   It has two hashes in it, which is kind of annoying.
[01:40:16.200 --> 01:40:17.000]   But yeah.
[01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:18.840]   Double hash.
[01:40:18.840 --> 01:40:21.040]   And so if I send you this double hash, we'll have--
[01:40:21.040 --> 01:40:21.560]   Copy that.
[01:40:21.560 --> 01:40:22.600]   Put that in the chat.
[01:40:22.600 --> 01:40:23.200]   OK.
[01:40:23.200 --> 01:40:23.720]   OK.
[01:40:23.720 --> 01:40:23.720]   Good.
[01:40:23.720 --> 01:40:25.960]   Copy your profile URL.
[01:40:25.960 --> 01:40:27.680]   Now let me put this in the chat room.
[01:40:27.680 --> 01:40:29.360]   So everybody can follow me.
[01:40:29.360 --> 01:40:33.400]   Now what happens when they click that,
[01:40:33.400 --> 01:40:36.000]   they have to have the beaker browser for that to do anything.
[01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:37.520]   They have to have the beaker browser to click that, yes.
[01:40:37.520 --> 01:40:37.880]   OK.
[01:40:37.880 --> 01:40:42.480]   All DATs, DATs, need the beaker browser to understand them.
[01:40:42.480 --> 01:40:44.040]   And now I can have--
[01:40:44.040 --> 01:40:45.920]   but OK.
[01:40:45.920 --> 01:40:49.440]   So if I follow other people, I see two people.
[01:40:49.440 --> 01:40:54.040]   If I follow them, they'll be part of my timeline.
[01:40:54.040 --> 01:40:55.160]   Yes.
[01:40:55.160 --> 01:40:56.160]   All right.
[01:40:56.160 --> 01:40:57.920]   I've pasted it in.
[01:40:57.920 --> 01:40:59.720]   This is very much like--
[01:40:59.720 --> 01:41:01.840]   so that's why it said select profile from library.
[01:41:01.840 --> 01:41:04.240]   If you have a profile URL, you can--
[01:41:04.240 --> 01:41:08.320]   I can use that profile URL on other machines.
[01:41:08.320 --> 01:41:11.880]   Embed all images to create a seamless timeline.
[01:41:11.880 --> 01:41:13.160]   OK.
[01:41:13.160 --> 01:41:18.080]   And then I've typed only one tweet, which is hello world.
[01:41:18.080 --> 01:41:21.520]   And in honor of our grooms, I've bearded myself.
[01:41:21.520 --> 01:41:25.000]   So I have a profile picture with me with a beard, which I've
[01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.720]   actually never had.
[01:41:27.720 --> 01:41:29.760]   So there you go.
[01:41:29.760 --> 01:41:31.720]   This is fritter.
[01:41:31.720 --> 01:41:36.280]   And fritter is Twitter, but it's peer to peer.
[01:41:36.280 --> 01:41:38.680]   Will it-- is it going to use push?
[01:41:38.680 --> 01:41:40.640]   Will-- if you put a notification on the timeline,
[01:41:40.640 --> 01:41:44.280]   will it be pushed into my fritter?
[01:41:44.280 --> 01:41:44.800]   Yes.
[01:41:44.800 --> 01:41:46.600]   Stop pushing yourself into my fritter.
[01:41:46.600 --> 01:41:48.080]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[01:41:48.080 --> 01:41:51.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:41:51.080 --> 01:41:52.560]   Oh boy.
[01:41:52.560 --> 01:41:53.080]   OK.
[01:41:53.080 --> 01:41:54.240]   Well, it's interesting.
[01:41:54.240 --> 01:41:56.240]   I like the idea.
[01:41:56.240 --> 01:41:58.280]   It's using some of my bandwidth, I presume.
[01:41:59.280 --> 01:42:01.280]   Yes.
[01:42:01.280 --> 01:42:03.280]   It's kind of like Napster.
[01:42:03.280 --> 01:42:07.920]   It would use that initiative to serve you, yeah.
[01:42:07.920 --> 01:42:09.520]   Yeah.
[01:42:09.520 --> 01:42:13.640]   And you can see-- OK.
[01:42:13.640 --> 01:42:18.880]   And this is using Beaker and WebDB to create a simple Twitter
[01:42:18.880 --> 01:42:20.360]   clone.
[01:42:20.360 --> 01:42:22.120]   And the world is reeling.
[01:42:22.120 --> 01:42:23.120]   Reeling.
[01:42:23.120 --> 01:42:25.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:42:25.840 --> 01:42:27.040]   There is-- yeah.
[01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:30.720]   So it is starting from-- it's basically saying,
[01:42:30.720 --> 01:42:31.880]   what if we replace the web--
[01:42:31.880 --> 01:42:32.320]   and whatnot.
[01:42:32.320 --> 01:42:35.280]   But the interesting thing is that once you've embraced this,
[01:42:35.280 --> 01:42:38.640]   you can easily start serving a website from your own machine
[01:42:38.640 --> 01:42:40.320]   and share it with other people that have the browser.
[01:42:40.320 --> 01:42:47.800]   And there is a proxy that will map it back to the real web
[01:42:47.800 --> 01:42:48.120]   as well.
[01:42:48.120 --> 01:42:49.040]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:42:49.040 --> 01:42:49.560]   Yeah.
[01:42:49.560 --> 01:42:50.040]   AT&E web.
[01:42:50.040 --> 01:42:51.960]   Yeah, that would make sense.
[01:42:51.960 --> 01:42:56.120]   Because if they did that, then people would find me.
[01:42:56.120 --> 01:42:57.720]   But then they could run Beaker and they could--
[01:42:57.720 --> 01:42:59.200]   Maybe blocking the dance.
[01:42:59.200 --> 01:43:00.840]   What's blocking the dance?
[01:43:00.840 --> 01:43:02.040]   My firewall.
[01:43:02.040 --> 01:43:04.360]   Your firewall may be blocking the dance.
[01:43:04.360 --> 01:43:05.360]   Yeah.
[01:43:05.360 --> 01:43:07.800]   I'm not staying right under them from here.
[01:43:07.800 --> 01:43:08.240]   Yeah.
[01:43:08.240 --> 01:43:09.040]   That's another thing.
[01:43:09.040 --> 01:43:14.960]   You have to open port forward the fritter protocol.
[01:43:14.960 --> 01:43:17.800]   We have to whitelist it.
[01:43:17.800 --> 01:43:18.320]   OK.
[01:43:18.320 --> 01:43:21.000]   No, no, I mean, it won't bite it full for me.
[01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:24.880]   But what ports are it using?
[01:43:24.880 --> 01:43:25.280]   Do you know?
[01:43:25.280 --> 01:43:25.960]   I don't know.
[01:43:25.960 --> 01:43:28.040]   I didn't actually need to do that.
[01:43:28.040 --> 01:43:30.800]   You didn't need to do anything.
[01:43:30.800 --> 01:43:32.240]   OK.
[01:43:32.240 --> 01:43:33.400]   It's not HTTP.
[01:43:33.400 --> 01:43:34.160]   Is it HTTP?
[01:43:34.160 --> 01:43:38.880]   It will use HTTP as a fallback.
[01:43:38.880 --> 01:43:43.080]   But you need to have some path to discover the root
[01:43:43.080 --> 01:43:44.600]   for it in the first place.
[01:43:44.600 --> 01:43:49.080]   And then there are public peers where you can share your long URL.
[01:43:49.080 --> 01:43:50.720]   Here's hash base.
[01:43:50.720 --> 01:43:52.640]   And you could share in hash base.
[01:43:52.640 --> 01:43:58.520]   You could share your long URL so that others could find you.
[01:43:58.520 --> 01:44:03.920]   Well, as usual, you've presented us
[01:44:03.920 --> 01:44:07.040]   with something that is going to go take many, many hours
[01:44:07.040 --> 01:44:12.360]   of my time to figure out what the hell it is.
[01:44:12.360 --> 01:44:13.520]   No, it's fascinating.
[01:44:13.520 --> 01:44:17.200]   And the idea would be that it would be a decentralized
[01:44:17.200 --> 01:44:18.120]   internet.
[01:44:18.120 --> 01:44:20.160]   You wouldn't need servers.
[01:44:20.160 --> 01:44:24.000]   Everybody's a server.
[01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:25.920]   Yes.
[01:44:25.920 --> 01:44:26.520]   Right.
[01:44:26.520 --> 01:44:27.560]   You wouldn't need apps.
[01:44:27.560 --> 01:44:28.520]   I could be Facebook.
[01:44:28.520 --> 01:44:30.880]   Yes.
[01:44:30.880 --> 01:44:32.120]   Somebody would have to write an app for it.
[01:44:32.120 --> 01:44:35.640]   I put a mirror on my website.
[01:44:35.640 --> 01:44:37.120]   What do we call this now?
[01:44:37.120 --> 01:44:38.400]   Fritter?
[01:44:38.400 --> 01:44:39.440]   No, no, beaker.
[01:44:39.440 --> 01:44:43.880]   The problem is less of this.
[01:44:43.880 --> 01:44:45.360]   There's that which is the protocol.
[01:44:45.360 --> 01:44:46.520]   There's beaker.
[01:44:46.520 --> 01:44:47.040]   It's the browser.
[01:44:47.040 --> 01:44:48.080]   And it sounds the protocol.
[01:44:48.080 --> 01:44:50.560]   And there's Fritter, which is the app written on top of it.
[01:44:50.560 --> 01:44:54.120]   Are there other apps?
[01:44:54.120 --> 01:44:54.600]   Yes.
[01:44:54.600 --> 01:44:55.960]   Yeah, there's other things people doing as well.
[01:44:55.960 --> 01:44:56.800]   OK.
[01:44:56.800 --> 01:45:03.520]   And that I would find at where?
[01:45:03.520 --> 01:45:06.200]   At that site I mentioned.
[01:45:06.200 --> 01:45:07.200]   Yes.
[01:45:07.200 --> 01:45:09.880]   If you go to the Beaker browser site,
[01:45:09.880 --> 01:45:11.880]   then that will get you into this.
[01:45:11.880 --> 01:45:13.200]   There's more stuff.
[01:45:13.200 --> 01:45:16.680]   So really start at beakerbrowser.com.
[01:45:16.680 --> 01:45:20.320]   And from there, it's rethinking the web browser
[01:45:20.320 --> 01:45:24.680]   as a peer-to-peer client.
[01:45:24.680 --> 01:45:26.120]   Actually, that is kind of interesting.
[01:45:26.120 --> 01:45:31.320]   And now, ladies and gentlemen, Stacey
[01:45:31.320 --> 01:45:34.720]   has had time to prepare her magic mirror.
[01:45:34.720 --> 01:45:35.480]   Oh, you got it.
[01:45:35.480 --> 01:45:39.120]   She's muted.
[01:45:39.120 --> 01:45:39.640]   Mute.
[01:45:39.640 --> 01:45:40.400]   Mute, Stacey.
[01:45:40.400 --> 01:45:40.920]   Mute.
[01:45:40.920 --> 01:45:43.120]   Unmute.
[01:45:43.120 --> 01:45:44.280]   Sorry, the dog.
[01:45:44.280 --> 01:45:49.160]   I didn't want to interrupt the Fritter discussion.
[01:45:49.160 --> 01:45:50.920]   He's a Fritter Critter, actually.
[01:45:50.920 --> 01:45:53.200]   It's perfectly appropriate.
[01:45:53.200 --> 01:45:56.200]   And I don't know how I'm going to get you guys to see this.
[01:45:56.200 --> 01:45:57.400]   This is my new challenge.
[01:45:57.400 --> 01:45:59.400]   I'm like, because I don't think you can see.
[01:45:59.400 --> 01:46:00.520]   I can see it well enough.
[01:46:00.520 --> 01:46:02.840]   So I see you in the mirror.
[01:46:02.840 --> 01:46:04.720]   You see the--
[01:46:04.720 --> 01:46:05.640]   Yeah.
[01:46:05.640 --> 01:46:07.600]   I see the mirror behind you.
[01:46:07.600 --> 01:46:09.120]   Do you see the back--
[01:46:09.120 --> 01:46:10.520]   do you see the little--
[01:46:10.520 --> 01:46:12.000]   do you see the words on the mirror?
[01:46:12.000 --> 01:46:13.760]   I don't see words on the mirror, no.
[01:46:13.760 --> 01:46:15.160]   Yeah, so that's--
[01:46:15.160 --> 01:46:19.360]   So this is a mirror that will display information on it.
[01:46:19.360 --> 01:46:20.160]   Does.
[01:46:20.160 --> 01:46:20.720]   Let's see.
[01:46:20.720 --> 01:46:22.080]   Turn your lights off.
[01:46:22.080 --> 01:46:22.680]   Would that help?
[01:46:22.680 --> 01:46:23.680]   Oh, that's a good idea.
[01:46:23.680 --> 01:46:23.680]   Yeah.
[01:46:23.680 --> 01:46:24.920]   Hold on.
[01:46:24.920 --> 01:46:26.120]   OK.
[01:46:26.120 --> 01:46:27.560]   So of course, we won't be able to see you anymore,
[01:46:27.560 --> 01:46:29.120]   but maybe we'll be able to see the--
[01:46:29.120 --> 01:46:30.440]   nope, can't see a bloody thing.
[01:46:30.440 --> 01:46:34.840]   Can you see it now?
[01:46:34.840 --> 01:46:35.320]   No, but--
[01:46:35.320 --> 01:46:36.200]   Go in a replacing.
[01:46:36.200 --> 01:46:37.840]   No, but it's much more romantic.
[01:46:37.840 --> 01:46:39.560]   That's all I really wanted.
[01:46:39.560 --> 01:46:40.160]   There we go.
[01:46:40.160 --> 01:46:41.120]   All right.
[01:46:41.120 --> 01:46:41.600]   OK.
[01:46:41.600 --> 01:46:43.120]   Well, what you can't see--
[01:46:43.120 --> 01:46:44.440]   oh, this is so terrible.
[01:46:44.440 --> 01:46:47.760]   So the idea is this is an informational mirror.
[01:46:47.760 --> 01:46:48.200]   This is.
[01:46:48.200 --> 01:46:51.200]   So what-- right now it's showing the time, the weather,
[01:46:51.200 --> 01:46:53.120]   the weather forecast for five days.
[01:46:53.120 --> 01:46:55.760]   Can you hold it up to the camera, maybe?
[01:46:55.760 --> 01:46:56.240]   Well, OK.
[01:46:56.240 --> 01:46:57.440]   Here's my challenge.
[01:46:57.440 --> 01:46:59.280]   You may have to call me back, because I'm
[01:46:59.280 --> 01:47:01.160]   going to bring the computer closer, but I--
[01:47:01.160 --> 01:47:03.040]   Why don't you bring the mirror closer?
[01:47:03.040 --> 01:47:04.840]   I can't, because it's plugged in.
[01:47:04.840 --> 01:47:06.360]   Oh, it's plugged in.
[01:47:06.360 --> 01:47:07.840]   So that's the length of the plug.
[01:47:07.840 --> 01:47:10.000]   Can you pick up the camera and slide it a little bit closer,
[01:47:10.000 --> 01:47:10.320]   maybe?
[01:47:10.320 --> 01:47:11.160]   I don't know.
[01:47:11.160 --> 01:47:12.160]   Maybe try an angle.
[01:47:12.160 --> 01:47:16.920]   Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:47:16.920 --> 01:47:17.640]   We can kind of see.
[01:47:17.640 --> 01:47:19.040]   Now I get it.
[01:47:19.040 --> 01:47:20.040]   OK.
[01:47:20.040 --> 01:47:21.000]   Whoa.
[01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:22.040]   Yeah, we can see something.
[01:47:22.040 --> 01:47:23.040]   Yeah.
[01:47:23.040 --> 01:47:24.040]   OK.
[01:47:24.040 --> 01:47:25.040]   Sorry.
[01:47:25.040 --> 01:47:25.400]   Yeah.
[01:47:25.400 --> 01:47:28.320]   So I see my fritter.
[01:47:28.320 --> 01:47:31.120]   There's my fritter site right there.
[01:47:31.120 --> 01:47:33.280]   Too quick.
[01:47:33.280 --> 01:47:34.720]   Is this--
[01:47:34.720 --> 01:47:35.720]   So that--
[01:47:35.720 --> 01:47:36.560]   Why did you guys stick?
[01:47:36.560 --> 01:47:37.840]   There's some text there.
[01:47:37.840 --> 01:47:38.520]   Yeah, on the right.
[01:47:38.520 --> 01:47:41.040]   Just text fresh speed in the verge of speed.
[01:47:41.040 --> 01:47:42.160]   Oh, that's a tech crunch.
[01:47:42.160 --> 01:47:43.840]   Oh, that's a news feed in there.
[01:47:43.840 --> 01:47:44.760]   It's a news feed.
[01:47:44.760 --> 01:47:49.600]   So I can read the headlines on my mirror in that screen.
[01:47:49.600 --> 01:47:50.120]   Wow.
[01:47:50.120 --> 01:47:52.120]   And it's about--
[01:47:52.120 --> 01:47:55.320]   it's maybe embedded screen.
[01:47:55.320 --> 01:47:58.360]   And I'm trying to think about how many inches, 6'5".
[01:47:58.360 --> 01:48:00.480]   Yeah, we could see how small it is.
[01:48:00.480 --> 01:48:03.120]   But you could read that if you're standing in front of the mirror.
[01:48:03.120 --> 01:48:04.040]   Yes.
[01:48:04.040 --> 01:48:07.480]   And in a minute, so you set this up.
[01:48:07.480 --> 01:48:08.360]   It can do news.
[01:48:08.360 --> 01:48:09.480]   It can do health data.
[01:48:09.480 --> 01:48:10.720]   It can do your Twitter.
[01:48:10.720 --> 01:48:11.720]   Wow.
[01:48:11.720 --> 01:48:12.720]   It can do--
[01:48:12.720 --> 01:48:13.560]   How much is it?
[01:48:13.560 --> 01:48:17.800]   It's 500 for a big one, I think, and 400 for a smaller one.
[01:48:17.800 --> 01:48:19.160]   I have to--
[01:48:19.160 --> 01:48:20.720]   Go to the website.
[01:48:20.720 --> 01:48:23.920]   Is the idea-- the idea is it'd be like a standing mirror
[01:48:23.920 --> 01:48:27.160]   somewhere, or could you put it in your bathroom?
[01:48:27.160 --> 01:48:28.360]   You can put it in your bathroom.
[01:48:28.360 --> 01:48:29.360]   You can put it in your bathroom.
[01:48:29.360 --> 01:48:30.360]   You can put it in the door.
[01:48:30.360 --> 01:48:31.360]   There it is.
[01:48:31.360 --> 01:48:32.880]   Oh, that's kind of cool.
[01:48:32.880 --> 01:48:35.680]   And in a second, you should see my fit fit data.
[01:48:35.680 --> 01:48:36.360]   There it is.
[01:48:36.360 --> 01:48:39.400]   OK, so that's like my steps and extended energy.
[01:48:39.400 --> 01:48:40.760]   Oh, it has graphs.
[01:48:40.760 --> 01:48:43.320]   That's neat.
[01:48:43.320 --> 01:48:46.440]   And the cool thing is, it can be tuned to your users.
[01:48:46.440 --> 01:48:49.800]   So when I step in front of the mirror with my phone,
[01:48:49.800 --> 01:48:52.160]   it shows you my stuff.
[01:48:52.160 --> 01:48:54.120]   When my husband steps in front of the mirror,
[01:48:54.120 --> 01:48:55.000]   it will show him--
[01:48:55.000 --> 01:48:56.760]   How do it know?
[01:48:56.760 --> 01:48:59.560]   It knows because of the iPhone app.
[01:48:59.560 --> 01:49:02.480]   So this is Bluetooth connecting from iPhone.
[01:49:02.480 --> 01:49:05.360]   That's where it's getting the data from, is the iPhone.
[01:49:05.360 --> 01:49:10.320]   And you set it up so it's in range.
[01:49:10.320 --> 01:49:11.640]   And you can set your range.
[01:49:11.640 --> 01:49:15.680]   I've got mindset to like five feet, I think.
[01:49:15.680 --> 01:49:18.560]   And if you're not within range, then it has a general setting
[01:49:18.560 --> 01:49:21.080]   that's just like whatever you want in your general setting,
[01:49:21.080 --> 01:49:24.240]   like news, weather, whatever.
[01:49:24.240 --> 01:49:29.320]   So it's kind of fun because you can do it based on people.
[01:49:29.320 --> 01:49:33.400]   And it's designed mostly for health and wellness.
[01:49:33.400 --> 01:49:35.440]   So it's not going to show you everything.
[01:49:35.440 --> 01:49:38.600]   But it's neat.
[01:49:38.600 --> 01:49:41.040]   I don't carry my phone into the bathroom.
[01:49:41.040 --> 01:49:44.400]   So I would put this for me in the hallway,
[01:49:44.400 --> 01:49:46.600]   because I do have my phone when I'm about to leave.
[01:49:46.600 --> 01:49:47.920]   And I could be like, hey, what's the weather?
[01:49:47.920 --> 01:49:48.440]   OK, cool.
[01:49:48.440 --> 01:49:50.200]   That is pretty cool.
[01:49:50.200 --> 01:49:51.640]   So that's this mirror.
[01:49:51.640 --> 01:49:54.720]   It is kind of expensive, but it's a perfectly nice mirror.
[01:49:54.720 --> 01:49:57.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:49:57.400 --> 01:49:58.360]   And--
[01:49:58.360 --> 01:50:00.520]   And don't drop it because it's more than seven years
[01:50:00.520 --> 01:50:02.040]   bad luck if you break it.
[01:50:02.040 --> 01:50:03.120]   Yeah, connected mirrors.
[01:50:03.120 --> 01:50:06.280]   That's like a long rhythmic bad luck.
[01:50:06.280 --> 01:50:09.240]   I kind of like that idea, although I don't spend a lot of time
[01:50:09.240 --> 01:50:10.680]   staring in the mirror.
[01:50:10.680 --> 01:50:14.200]   But I guess if you did, like doing your makeup or something
[01:50:14.200 --> 01:50:14.400]   that--
[01:50:14.400 --> 01:50:16.720]   Well, it's motion detected, too.
[01:50:16.720 --> 01:50:20.360]   So when I'm doing my makeup, I was doing my makeup in it.
[01:50:20.360 --> 01:50:23.360]   But I was like, I'm not reading stuff while I'm doing my makeup
[01:50:23.360 --> 01:50:26.960]   because I am doing my makeup.
[01:50:26.960 --> 01:50:30.880]   So I don't really know about that lady there, but--
[01:50:30.880 --> 01:50:32.880]   you know.
[01:50:32.880 --> 01:50:33.880]   Sure.
[01:50:33.880 --> 01:50:35.400]   What's she doing?
[01:50:35.400 --> 01:50:38.120]   Well, I mean, she's not doing any in-depth makeup.
[01:50:38.120 --> 01:50:38.680]   That's plus.
[01:50:38.680 --> 01:50:40.880]   You could totally do that.
[01:50:40.880 --> 01:50:42.680]   And read the New York Times.
[01:50:42.680 --> 01:50:43.040]   Yes.
[01:50:43.040 --> 01:50:43.800]   Very cool.
[01:50:43.800 --> 01:50:45.120]   What's it called again?
[01:50:45.120 --> 01:50:46.800]   It's the mango mirror.
[01:50:46.800 --> 01:50:48.800]   Mango mirror.
[01:50:48.800 --> 01:50:49.240]   Very interesting.
[01:50:49.240 --> 01:50:51.320]   And they actually have a really--
[01:50:51.320 --> 01:50:52.280]   it's made in Ontario.
[01:50:52.280 --> 01:50:54.520]   They have a very focused privacy policy.
[01:50:54.520 --> 01:50:57.000]   So some of the things-- and right now I should tell you,
[01:50:57.000 --> 01:50:58.800]   it's iOS only.
[01:50:58.800 --> 01:51:00.440]   It is not Android.
[01:51:00.440 --> 01:51:02.840]   So be sad if you have an Android phone.
[01:51:02.840 --> 01:51:03.680]   And you want this.
[01:51:03.680 --> 01:51:07.120]   And it works with FitFit, MapMyFitness.
[01:51:07.120 --> 01:51:09.360]   How does your family feel about the fact
[01:51:09.360 --> 01:51:12.560]   that your house is getting more and more automated?
[01:51:12.560 --> 01:51:12.920]   And the--
[01:51:12.920 --> 01:51:15.200]   Oh my gosh.
[01:51:15.200 --> 01:51:15.880]   They're OK with it.
[01:51:15.880 --> 01:51:16.880]   My husband saw this.
[01:51:16.880 --> 01:51:17.760]   And he's in the bathroom.
[01:51:17.760 --> 01:51:19.360]   And he's in the shower in front of the mirror.
[01:51:19.360 --> 01:51:20.760]   And suddenly he's like, wait, does this
[01:51:20.760 --> 01:51:22.280]   like have a camera?
[01:51:22.280 --> 01:51:24.920]   Yeah, it's the first thing I'd ask.
[01:51:24.920 --> 01:51:27.080]   But like my housekeeper was in here.
[01:51:27.080 --> 01:51:30.280]   And she's like, she's like, what is this?
[01:51:30.280 --> 01:51:32.640]   Stacey, I don't want to clean this.
[01:51:32.640 --> 01:51:34.000]   Yeah.
[01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:34.480]   Yeah.
[01:51:34.480 --> 01:51:36.280]   So there were definitely some--
[01:51:36.280 --> 01:51:37.400]   Wow.
[01:51:37.400 --> 01:51:38.640]   Some challenges.
[01:51:38.640 --> 01:51:40.360]   Fair inch, mango mirror.
[01:51:40.360 --> 01:51:42.680]   Stacey's thing this week.
[01:51:42.680 --> 01:51:46.440]   Stacey does a great newsletter at staceyoniot.com.
[01:51:46.440 --> 01:51:46.880]   It's free.
[01:51:46.880 --> 01:51:48.320]   You must subscribe.
[01:51:48.320 --> 01:51:49.760]   Follow her in Kevin Tofel.
[01:51:49.760 --> 01:51:52.120]   They have a great podcast.
[01:51:52.120 --> 01:51:54.240]   IoT podcast.
[01:51:54.240 --> 01:51:56.360]   All of it's at staceyoniot.com.
[01:51:56.360 --> 01:51:57.840]   She's at gay and stacey on Twitter.
[01:51:57.840 --> 01:51:58.720]   Yes, next.
[01:51:58.720 --> 01:52:01.560]   And next week, Kevin should be here.
[01:52:01.560 --> 01:52:02.560]   That's right.
[01:52:02.560 --> 01:52:03.360]   Because I love being--
[01:52:03.360 --> 01:52:05.040]   Filling in for Stacey.
[01:52:05.040 --> 01:52:07.240]   And we should mention that Stacey is
[01:52:07.240 --> 01:52:11.000]   going to be on our panel at South by Southwest March 9th,
[01:52:11.000 --> 01:52:12.040]   8.30 AM.
[01:52:12.040 --> 01:52:16.720]   There will be breakfast tacos at Antones.
[01:52:16.720 --> 01:52:19.400]   It's actually the first day of interactive at South By
[01:52:19.400 --> 01:52:20.240]   if you're in Austin.
[01:52:20.240 --> 01:52:21.520]   We have some very interesting guests.
[01:52:21.520 --> 01:52:24.000]   We're going to talk about consumer security.
[01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:26.760]   And actually, really what I want is kind of a roadmap
[01:52:26.760 --> 01:52:28.680]   for the year ahead.
[01:52:28.680 --> 01:52:29.920]   What things to watch out for?
[01:52:29.920 --> 01:52:31.560]   You'll be covering IoT.
[01:52:31.560 --> 01:52:33.920]   We have somebody from Duo Security
[01:52:33.920 --> 01:52:35.600]   going to talk about authentication.
[01:52:35.600 --> 01:52:38.320]   There's going to be some really interesting stuff going on.
[01:52:38.320 --> 01:52:39.840]   And we would love to meet you.
[01:52:39.840 --> 01:52:44.160]   The day before-- please don't laugh at us.
[01:52:44.160 --> 01:52:46.920]   But the day before we're going to have a meet up at a barbecue.
[01:52:46.920 --> 01:52:49.800]   And it may not be the best barbecue in the world.
[01:52:49.800 --> 01:52:52.160]   I just don't know.
[01:52:52.160 --> 01:52:52.800]   Where is it?
[01:52:52.800 --> 01:52:53.720]   Well, I'm going to tell you--
[01:52:53.720 --> 01:52:54.480]   Do I get to come?
[01:52:54.480 --> 01:52:55.880]   You're invited.
[01:52:55.880 --> 01:52:58.400]   I wouldn't presume for you to-- but I would love it
[01:52:58.400 --> 01:52:59.560]   if you would come.
[01:52:59.560 --> 01:53:05.400]   We have a blog post at twit.tv/blog.
[01:53:05.400 --> 01:53:10.480]   The place is going to be Freedmen's.
[01:53:10.480 --> 01:53:13.040]   Do you know Freedmen's Barbecue?
[01:53:13.040 --> 01:53:14.560]   No.
[01:53:14.560 --> 01:53:15.120]   OK.
[01:53:15.120 --> 01:53:16.840]   It's up and coming, I'm told.
[01:53:16.840 --> 01:53:17.960]   Up and coming.
[01:53:17.960 --> 01:53:18.880]   And we're going to be there.
[01:53:18.880 --> 01:53:20.200]   It's going to be just a casual thing.
[01:53:20.200 --> 01:53:22.640]   5 to 7 PM Thursday night.
[01:53:22.640 --> 01:53:24.200]   Barbecue's on me, Stacey.
[01:53:24.200 --> 01:53:28.840]   So come on to Freedmen's Bar.com and find out where it is.
[01:53:28.840 --> 01:53:30.320]   And we will see you.
[01:53:30.320 --> 01:53:31.160]   There it is.
[01:53:31.160 --> 01:53:31.160]   See?
[01:53:31.160 --> 01:53:32.160]   See?
[01:53:32.160 --> 01:53:32.800]   Doesn't look cute?
[01:53:32.800 --> 01:53:33.760]   Be your garden.
[01:53:33.760 --> 01:53:36.760]   Lay back Whiskey Lounge and Smokehouse.
[01:53:36.760 --> 01:53:38.240]   Oh, you had me at Whiskey Lounge.
[01:53:38.240 --> 01:53:39.120]   Yeah.
[01:53:39.120 --> 01:53:39.960]   There you go.
[01:53:39.960 --> 01:53:41.440]   Whiskey's on me.
[01:53:41.440 --> 01:53:43.640]   It's on San Gabriel Street.
[01:53:43.640 --> 01:53:44.400]   OK, yeah.
[01:53:44.400 --> 01:53:45.080]   Come on over.
[01:53:45.080 --> 01:53:48.280]   And then the next morning, if you hadn't had too much whiskey
[01:53:48.280 --> 01:53:51.840]   at the Whiskey Bar, we'll be at Anton's on 5th Street
[01:53:51.840 --> 01:53:53.960]   for the 830 panel.
[01:53:53.960 --> 01:53:55.800]   And I'd love to see everybody come out.
[01:53:55.800 --> 01:53:59.440]   We initially thought you had to have a South By badge
[01:53:59.440 --> 01:54:00.280]   to come to the panel.
[01:54:00.280 --> 01:54:01.920]   But we've been told, thank you, Anton's.
[01:54:01.920 --> 01:54:02.840]   Thank you, Capital One.
[01:54:02.840 --> 01:54:04.200]   It's the Capital One House.
[01:54:04.200 --> 01:54:06.080]   They are going to waive that requirement.
[01:54:06.080 --> 01:54:08.960]   So you can come even if you're not going to South By.
[01:54:08.960 --> 01:54:09.680]   Please come.
[01:54:09.680 --> 01:54:10.440]   We'd love to see you.
[01:54:10.440 --> 01:54:14.320]   Anton's is the Capital One House March 9, 830 in the morning.
[01:54:14.320 --> 01:54:16.640]   Stacey, me and a bunch of great people.
[01:54:16.640 --> 01:54:17.400]   Bring the mirror.
[01:54:17.400 --> 01:54:22.840]   Bring the mango.
[01:54:22.840 --> 01:54:24.040]   Thank you, Stacey.
[01:54:24.040 --> 01:54:26.800]   Kevin Marks is at indyweb.org.
[01:54:26.800 --> 01:54:28.960]   You got any big events coming up soon, Kevin?
[01:54:28.960 --> 01:54:38.880]   We've got the regular Hobo website club, which is, I think,
[01:54:38.880 --> 01:54:44.040]   normally it's next Wednesday, not this Wednesday.
[01:54:44.040 --> 01:54:48.000]   Ironically, I can't reach indyweb.org in my Beaker browser.
[01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:50.520]   However, I am finding some interesting apps
[01:54:50.520 --> 01:54:54.080]   in the Beaker browser, including ARSS feed.
[01:54:54.080 --> 01:54:55.560]   That's kind of cool.
[01:54:55.560 --> 01:54:58.040]   It's called Dat RSS Reader.
[01:54:58.040 --> 01:55:02.720]   And I presume that Phrasey, who built it using Chu,
[01:55:02.720 --> 01:55:04.440]   is hosting it.
[01:55:04.440 --> 01:55:06.360]   So that's kind of cool.
[01:55:06.360 --> 01:55:08.720]   And Tara's been posting pictures there
[01:55:08.720 --> 01:55:11.080]   for Hot Pink Nails and other things.
[01:55:11.080 --> 01:55:15.360]   So I'm very intrigued by all this.
[01:55:15.360 --> 01:55:16.560]   So there's, yes.
[01:55:16.560 --> 01:55:20.000]   So Paul and Tara are other people who built Fritter.
[01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:24.080]   And they're also building some parts of Beaker as well.
[01:55:24.080 --> 01:55:26.360]   Ah, really, really interesting.
[01:55:26.360 --> 01:55:27.640]   Yes, say hi to them.
[01:55:27.640 --> 01:55:28.720]   I will.
[01:55:28.720 --> 01:55:32.200]   It's sort of-- is this like--
[01:55:32.200 --> 01:55:34.200]   they've been sort of digging away building
[01:55:34.200 --> 01:55:35.960]   like the lower level pieces and getting that working.
[01:55:35.960 --> 01:55:37.040]   And then they were like, OK, then we can
[01:55:37.040 --> 01:55:37.920]   build a browser on top of that.
[01:55:37.920 --> 01:55:39.920]   And it's like, now you can build a Twitter client
[01:55:39.920 --> 01:55:42.840]   on top of the browser, on top of the protocol.
[01:55:42.840 --> 01:55:45.320]   And at that point, it starts being fun.
[01:55:45.320 --> 01:55:47.960]   Tara's quite the nail fanatic.
[01:55:47.960 --> 01:55:49.840]   A lot of pictures of her nails on here.
[01:55:49.840 --> 01:55:53.240]   I don't know what that means.
[01:55:53.240 --> 01:55:54.840]   Thank you, Jeff Jarvis.
[01:55:54.840 --> 01:55:57.400]   He's going to turn into a Fritter himself.
[01:55:57.400 --> 01:55:59.680]   If we don't let him go, Buzzmachine.com.
[01:55:59.680 --> 01:56:03.200]   Go enjoy the wonderful coffee in Amsterdam.
[01:56:03.200 --> 01:56:04.240]   Stay up late.
[01:56:04.240 --> 01:56:05.080]   Have a great time.
[01:56:05.080 --> 01:56:05.840]   It's nice to have you.
[01:56:05.840 --> 01:56:08.360]   Buzzmachine.com, CUNY, and elsewhere.
[01:56:08.360 --> 01:56:09.440]   Thank you, Jeff.
[01:56:09.440 --> 01:56:11.000]   See you next week, everybody.
[01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:12.880]   We do this week in Google.
[01:56:12.880 --> 01:56:14.280]   Go to the seafood bar.
[01:56:14.280 --> 01:56:18.240]   Go to the seafood bar, named aptly the Seafood Bar.
[01:56:18.240 --> 01:56:20.640]   [INAUDIBLE]
[01:56:20.640 --> 01:56:23.840]   AKA the Fisk Bar.
[01:56:23.840 --> 01:56:25.800]   That's in--
[01:56:25.800 --> 01:56:28.240]   [INAUDIBLE]
[01:56:28.240 --> 01:56:29.560]   Fisk Bar.
[01:56:29.560 --> 01:56:31.320]   Fisk Bar.
