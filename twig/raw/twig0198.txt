[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.200]   It's time for Twig this week in Google.
[00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:03.520]   A really special episode.
[00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.520]   Jeff and Gina are here in studio.
[00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.840]   We've got three pixels all in a row,
[00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.960]   and we're going to tell you everything that happened
[00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.280]   in our analysis too of the Google I/O keynote.
[00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:14.600]   It's next on Twig.
[00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:20.360]   Netcast you love.
[00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:21.720]   From people you trust.
[00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:28.040]   This is Twig.
[00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.800]   Bandwidth for this week in Google

[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.320]   This is Twig.
[00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.840]   This week in Google, episode 198, recorded May 15, 2013.
[00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.920]   Google I/O 2013.

[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.760]   And what a day it is.
[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.720]   This is kind of an unusual twig.
[00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.240]   We're doing it a little bit later in the day
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.240]   to give us time to watch a 18 hour keynote speech--
[00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.520]   felt that way, anyway.
[00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.200]   Pretty long speech.
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.800]   But joining me in studio-- and it's so nice to have them both
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.760]   with me, Gina Trepani, smarterware.org.
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.240]   So happy to be here.
[00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.200]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.080]   And in person--
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.080]   We drove up together in a small car,
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.120]   so we already had our--
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.280]   Where my knees turned.
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.240]   And it's Jeff Jarvis from Buzz Machine.
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.160]   And we were in the room during that long keynote.
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.320]   Do we have a final time on the keynote?
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.880]   So three minutes.
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.920]   It started smack dab on time at 9 AM.
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:26.800]   Yeah, with Countdown.
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:27.960]   There was a countdown on the screen.
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.800]   Yeah, developers flipping out.
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.040]   You know, with developers, you want to be precise.
[00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.560]   Yeah.
[00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.080]   Right?
[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.720]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.920]   So my time square for developers.
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.640]   And then went to sometime afternoon.
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.240]   So it was at least three-- three plus hours.
[00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.800]   It was at least three hours.
[00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:40.640]   I feel like it was--
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.360]   Longer than the director's cut of the Hobbit.
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.880]   It was supposed to be over at 11.40.
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.480]   It was over about 12.30.
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.120]   And I don't mind, because I have to say--
[00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.720]   well, before I say, you say, overall impression--
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.960]   not specifics, but just overall impression.
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:54.400]   How about you, Jenn?
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.960]   One has to be a little careful of being in the mood of the place.
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.840]   But still, I thought it was impressive.
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.640]   I'm not a developer, but I could see a lot was aimed
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.240]   at developers.
[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.920]   That's happy.
[00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.200]   So it wasn't a hardware while he was out.
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.320]   I was really struck at the end with Larry, I think,
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.160]   was trying to take on the mantle of Steve Jobs.
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.360]   It was quite a moment at the end with you.
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.560]   It was.
[00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.520]   Standing up in front of the world, going behind him.
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:14.520]   It was a little watch there.
[00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:15.160]   But fine.
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:15.880]   It was beautiful.
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.160]   And he was talking about the--
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.960]   Cat and ask.
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:18.320]   Yes, it was.
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.440]   To be honest, I--
[00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.000]   You soldiers, you boys, you're going out there.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.600]   OK, you're overall thoughts about it.
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.600]   A lot more subdued than last year,
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.680]   but enough developer of goodies to get me kind of really happy
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:32.480]   and excited.
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:33.160]   I mean--
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.880]   It was a developer conference after all out.
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:36.800]   It was truly a developer conference this year.
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.520]   There wasn't a circus like last year.
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.560]   There weren't skydivers, weren't tons of new products.
[00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.600]   They didn't imply us with tons of new gadgets.
[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.000]   I wasn't really upset about that.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.800]   It was slow and steady, but really nice upgrades and new tools
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.720]   and things that we'll talk about both for consumers
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.480]   and developers, but kicked off with the developer of goodies,
[00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:54.480]   which made me really happy.
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:55.680]   And the energy in the room was good.
[00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.760]   And then went into consumer, I think,
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.200]   features that we're getting today that are impressive
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.000]   and I like.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.240]   So, dude, but slow and steady.
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.160]   And I'm generally happy with it.
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.080]   I thought it was a good--
[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.280]   A lot of attention always paid to the giveaways at Google I/O.
[00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.640]   Last year, they gave away about $1,200 worth of goodies,
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.200]   including a Google Q, a Chrome box--
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:15.680]   It's Q.
[00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.000]   Nexus Q, Chrome box on the Nexus 7.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:17.920]   Nexus 7.
[00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:18.420]   Yeah.
[00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:20.560]   This time, only one item, but an item worth more than all
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.560]   three of them.
[00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:22.000]   Well, that's right.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:23.600]   But an item that's out, right?
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:24.760]   That's been out, right?
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:25.280]   I mean, it's interesting.
[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.360]   But they said they want to encourage developers to use it
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.560]   and to build a Chrome.
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:29.200]   I think that's why they're--
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.240]   The developers were happy.
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.160]   By the way, we should say there are about 5,000 developers
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.040]   in the room.
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.520]   We estimate maybe 500 press, maybe more.
[00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:36.480]   Plus other kinds of partners.
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.080]   And then in the front, they call them I/Oers.
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.920]   And I think that they were Google employees.
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.040]   This is what Apple always did.
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:45.440]   They would make sure that there were Google employees in front.
[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.680]   Because those are the people who are going to applaud the lattice
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.840]   they're going to be seeing on screen.
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.200]   I don't know if that's the case.
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.120]   But they were reserved seats for the first maybe 10 rows.
[00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.720]   And then there's an entire section for Scobles Ego.
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.760]   Sorry.
[00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.920]   Robert Scobble made an appearance of all things.
[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:03.680]   At the end, Larry Page, this has happened before
[00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:04.920]   and other keynotes.
[00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.440]   But it's not common.
[00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.000]   But I think because Larry hasn't been heard from in a long time
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.800]   due to long paralysis--
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.200]   Do you ever answer questions?
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.800]   Steve Jobs?
[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:12.560]   No, no, no.
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:13.060]   Larry.
[00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.000]   Larry, I don't think so.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.520]   No.
[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:15.840]   Steve has.
[00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.200]   I can remember times when the Apple executive team has
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.680]   gone on stage after keynote answered questions.
[00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:21.920]   But those were for press only.
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:25.160]   This is a little different.
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.280]   Letting developers ask questions could be a little risky.
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.400]   But Larry, I don't think he hadn't spoken and seen
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:30.280]   in the publics a long time ago.
[00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:31.400]   You were trying to say about his throat
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:32.280]   that he talked about yesterday.
[00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:35.560]   He had paralyzed vocal cords from youth.
[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.240]   One from youth and then one recently.
[00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:40.360]   And that's why he was silent and silent about it for so long.
[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:44.920]   And as Mr. Publicness, I was very happy that he said that he
[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:46.320]   wished he'd revealed this sooner.
[00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.800]   He's gotten all kinds of good advice and support
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.040]   and helped other people.
[00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:52.720]   And as you said, when we were sitting there in the audience,
[00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.120]   folks like us who have insurance can afford
[00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.840]   to do these kinds of things are the ones who probably
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:00.200]   are the best positions to be public.
[00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:01.320]   I thought it was--
[00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:02.600]   let's start with the end.
[00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:03.920]   And because that's not a feature--
[00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:04.920]   we're not talking about features.
[00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.600]   We're talking about really more of a vibe,
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:11.360]   a good stall to the whole thing.
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:12.920]   I was really kind of moved by Larry.
[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:13.440]   Yeah, I was.
[00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.120]   Going up there.
[00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:19.800]   I felt like he wanted to come on stage, not only to be seen,
[00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.920]   but also to set the stage for--
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:25.240]   to kind of clarify something about what Google was up to.
[00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:26.720]   Yeah, I think that he had to give--
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.280]   this was the vision speech.
[00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:32.040]   All appropriate to be behind the Earth and all of space.
[00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:35.120]   But standing in front of a rotating globe.
[00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:37.840]   Now, on the screen at home, you only saw a little bit.
[00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:38.720]   I can't.
[00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:42.520]   But in the theater, it was Pat and I.
[00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:43.520]   Very impressive.
[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.520]   It was the dark side of the Earth, right, with the lights on.
[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:47.080]   It was beautiful.
[00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:48.080]   You could see the lights.
[00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:49.240]   The sun just barely behind.
[00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:50.600]   And image from the new Google Maps.
[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:51.440]   The new Google Maps was--
[00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:52.280]   Just magnificent.
[00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:53.080]   And so he stands there.
[00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:56.560]   And what he's really doing is giving the vision statement
[00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.160]   for Google and why they're excited,
[00:06:58.160 --> 00:06:59.240]   why they come in and build things.
[00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:01.720]   And somebody who gets smashed all the time
[00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:04.160]   for being an optimist, what I like to is he said
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:05.560]   that there was enough of--
[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:07.400]   in a couple ways, enough of being negative.
[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:08.920]   You don't build out of the negative.
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:10.000]   You build out of the positive.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.040]   You build out of trying to do that.
[00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.720]   Then he also went on talking about other companies
[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:13.720]   that were a little negative.
[00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:14.920]   But that was a different question.
[00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:15.640]   Yeah.
[00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:17.480]   And one thing I would point out--
[00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:21.480]   he was slammed Oracle saying they're only in it for the money.
[00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:23.480]   Yeah, money is more important than collaboration
[00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:24.680]   and cooperation.
[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:29.320]   He by extension slammed Microsoft and other companies
[00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:31.000]   who have sued them in the past.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.760]   But he also, I think, he felt like--
[00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:36.760]   he said it's not a zero sum game.
[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:40.640]   It's not a you win, we lose, we win, you lose game.
[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:43.040]   And there's plenty for all of us.
[00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:47.360]   And he really said that what we're about here is not making
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:48.840]   money, we're about changing the world.
[00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:50.280]   Yeah, he's trying to rally the troops.
[00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:52.240]   He's saying there's tons of opportunities
[00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:54.120]   that you should try to build something that hasn't been
[00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:56.360]   built already, that we look back to the olden days when
[00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:58.760]   people spend all their time hunting for food
[00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:00.440]   and trying to feed their family.
[00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:01.920]   We don't have to do that anymore.
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:04.640]   Now we can free ourselves up to do new things.
[00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:06.800]   And I think that was his message to developers,
[00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.160]   try to do something new, be ambitious.
[00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:14.400]   That whole kind of the moonshot kind of urging.
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:17.280]   He said we're not thinking about what other companies
[00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:18.080]   are doing.
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.920]   We're thinking about what we can do to advance the future.
[00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:22.280]   Right, and he said there's enough for everybody.
[00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:24.320]   Interoperability is important to Google.
[00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:27.840]   He said that Google put out an invitation
[00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:29.800]   to be interoperable with IM.
[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:32.560]   Recently, Microsoft only recently kind of took them up on that.
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:33.480]   And there was important--
[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:35.880]   I have to point out, and I don't want to be negative.
[00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:37.360]   Because he said let's be positive.
[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:39.080]   Well, there's a difference between constructive criticism
[00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:40.080]   and negativity.
[00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:41.400]   I think he was our critical faculties.
[00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:43.480]   And I think there's many as CEO of a company who'd say,
[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:45.160]   hey, stop being so critical of our stuff.
[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:46.040]   Just like it.
[00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:49.480]   But I also feel like this--
[00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:51.320]   I'd love to hear-- and I would have loved to have asked
[00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:51.960]   a question of scope.
[00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:53.280]   It would give me a moment I would have.
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:54.680]   I would have loved--
[00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:55.920]   we'll explain that.
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:57.640]   I would have loved to have asked him.
[00:08:57.640 --> 00:09:01.200]   But Larry, for instance, when you turned off support
[00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:05.280]   for Microsoft's EAS, when you told Microsoft
[00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:07.920]   to pull the YouTube application from Windows Mobile,
[00:09:07.920 --> 00:09:11.160]   when you did-- he's done things like that.
[00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:13.600]   Did you not see that as anti-competitive?
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.600]   Was that not a competitive move?
[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:16.080]   I mean--
[00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:18.360]   Do you pay a little attention to what the other guys are doing?
[00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:20.440]   Yeah, I mean, it's a fair point.
[00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:21.440]   It's a fair point.
[00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:22.800]   They've limited-- as a matter of fact,
[00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:28.800]   they've limited third party jabber invitations.
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:29.960]   I thought they fixed that.
[00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:30.440]   Are they fixed that?
[00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:31.800]   Yeah, I thought that they did fix it.
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:33.720]   I thought that was a temporary security chat room.
[00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:35.520]   You should correct me if I'm wrong.
[00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:36.320]   Yeah, there's--
[00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:38.520]   I think people certainly made moves that have been questionable.
[00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:39.840]   I don't think that--
[00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:40.880]   But I like what he was saying.
[00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:45.160]   And I think maybe it's aspirational quote.
[00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:47.720]   But I like the idea of let's not fight among each other.
[00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:49.920]   Let's compete-- if we're going to compete--
[00:09:49.920 --> 00:09:52.040]   to try to all make the best stuff we can.
[00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:54.720]   But I think he's also talking about government regulation
[00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:55.040]   and such.
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:56.920]   He was kind of saying we should be able to experiment.
[00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:58.760]   I mean, somebody said he wanted an island.
[00:09:58.760 --> 00:09:59.800]   He said, let's make an island.
[00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:02.280]   We can experiment with things, which is us.
[00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:03.960]   We all say, fine, experiment with us.
[00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:04.600]   We're happy to.
[00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:05.920]   Let's play with this stuff.
[00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:07.920]   And that kind of negativity of, oh my god,
[00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:08.760]   what can go wrong?
[00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:10.760]   It's terrible.
[00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:12.960]   But back to the kind of point, I think
[00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:18.280]   that the risk today is that we were starting to count up
[00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:20.560]   all the companies that maybe died today.
[00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:21.080]   Yeah.
[00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:24.040]   They call it Sherlocking because Apple, very famously,
[00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:26.520]   when they put spotlight search into the Macintosh,
[00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:29.080]   killed a very beautiful little search company,
[00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:30.760]   a little search program called Sherlock.
[00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:34.120]   So there were quite a few apps that might be partially
[00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:35.280]   Sherlock as of today.
[00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:39.040]   Four Square Yelp Pandora Pandora.
[00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:43.840]   Or a serious committee.
[00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:45.120]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:45.960]   God damn it.
[00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:47.280]   He's trying to get my pixel.
[00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:48.280]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:50.080]   I did it again.
[00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:51.440]   You know, I'm not drunk enough.
[00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:52.480]   So let me--
[00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:54.880]   Yeah, both Tina and I have now spilled.
[00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:56.400]   We're going to use tippy cups from now on.
[00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:57.080]   Did I get your pixel?
[00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:59.200]   I'm so sorry.
[00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:02.040]   So I-- for one, I think it's a--
[00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:04.040]   if Larry wants to say, let's-- this
[00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:05.280]   is an aspirational vision.
[00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:08.000]   Let's kind of forego the negativity.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:08.720]   You made a point.
[00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:10.240]   It's also about government.
[00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:12.200]   Yeah, it's also about just saying, oh my god, what could
[00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:12.640]   go wrong?
[00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:13.200]   What could go wrong?
[00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:14.640]   Let's try these things.
[00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:16.400]   And in his own story about his health,
[00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:18.080]   he kind of realized he said that he thought there should
[00:11:18.080 --> 00:11:19.360]   be private.
[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:20.880]   That's where he started as a default.
[00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:23.080]   But he saw the value of being public about it.
[00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:24.120]   It felt very personal.
[00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:25.560]   He started out talking about his dad
[00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:27.160]   and how his dad took them on a trip.
[00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:29.360]   And supported technology and science.
[00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:31.520]   It was very interested in those things.
[00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:32.560]   Yeah, I really like that.
[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:33.560]   He's focused on young people.
[00:11:33.560 --> 00:11:35.240]   He's a computer science as a marketing problem.
[00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:36.720]   And then if we're going to move ahead,
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:39.840]   we have to get more young people interested in science
[00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:40.400]   technology.
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:41.680]   And he told that story about his dad,
[00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:43.440]   how his dad brought him to a robotics conference,
[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:45.440]   and argued with the guy at the door to get him in,
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:47.280]   even though he was underage.
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:50.000]   And that how basically putting a call out to developers,
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   saying, be that person who argues for that young person
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   to get in.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.960]   And even during the Q&A, which, of course,
[00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:57.920]   piqued my interest, someone asked about women in technology.
[00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:00.280]   And he said, we have to start when they're girls, when
[00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:02.920]   they're young, and that we need to do that.
[00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:05.880]   Because we need more people solving these problems.
[00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:10.200]   I really have to say, when you see somebody who's been ill,
[00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:13.000]   and his voice was a little shaking, so he sounded ill,
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.360]   it's inevitable to say that, look at the echo of Steve Jobs
[00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:15.920]   here.
[00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:18.040]   And people were starting to compare him, at least in our chat
[00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:18.840]   room, to Steve Jobs.
[00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:20.680]   But I think this is not--
[00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:22.840]   while Steve was a visionary, a lot of what Steve was about
[00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:24.360]   was marketing productizing.
[00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:24.840]   Yes.
[00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:27.200]   I don't get the feeling that Larry was really going on about
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:27.360]   that.
[00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:28.800]   No, he wasn't pushing Google products.
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:29.840]   He wasn't trying to do that.
[00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:31.120]   He came out after the whole hype.
[00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:32.040]   He wasn't the hype master.
[00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:33.320]   He did review what we--
[00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:34.000]   A bit.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.840]   But I think-- no, I think what he saw was, I think,
[00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:43.120]   a need for vision in our industry.
[00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:44.120]   Here's a cup that I can't see.
[00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:44.880]   Leo's sippy cup.
[00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:49.120]   Bring the bib over to, please.
[00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:49.560]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:51.560]   And he wants to bib.
[00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:54.600]   So I think that there's a need for vision in this industry.
[00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:58.200]   And if he tries to take that up, he's been too silent.
[00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:00.960]   Not just of his voice, but too--
[00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:01.840]   we don't hear from Larry.
[00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:03.400]   Larry's hidden in behind the scenes.
[00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:05.880]   I think this was a coming out party that was very important,
[00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:06.800]   because he is really smart.
[00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:08.160]   He does have a vision.
[00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:10.400]   The company, Google, who said this on the show for the last year
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:12.440]   and a half, has been taking on his vision.
[00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:14.480]   He's been killing the things that don't work.
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:16.680]   You see the sense coming out.
[00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:19.240]   When you see the fact that Gina and I look at each other
[00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:22.240]   and doing the thing, and the fact that he knows what
[00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:24.880]   your good pictures are, is the same as doing what good pictures
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:26.240]   are overall for maps.
[00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:27.480]   I mean, that you start to see this red.
[00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:28.480]   That was kind of amazing.
[00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:29.120]   That was amazing.
[00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:31.640]   That was for things, maybe.
[00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:34.120]   He also did-- there were a few things that I thought--
[00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:34.880]   I also found interesting.
[00:13:34.880 --> 00:13:38.720]   No, no, no, no, no, Sergey Brin, who was very prominent last year
[00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:40.000]   at the keynote.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:42.840]   And he said-- Larry said, somebody asked him about Google Glass
[00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:44.040]   and how many they were going to produce.
[00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:44.720]   He said, I don't know.
[00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:45.640]   That's Sergey's thing.
[00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:46.000]   Right.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.040]   Sergey does Adams.
[00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:48.200]   He says, Sergey does Adams.
[00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:49.640]   I do bits.
[00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:51.440]   And I really felt like--
[00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:53.240]   That was an interesting way to--
[00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:55.040]   It was Larry's company, wasn't it?
[00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:55.520]   Yeah.
[00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:56.520]   Oh, yeah.
[00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:57.040]   Oh, yeah.
[00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:57.520]   This was--
[00:13:57.520 --> 00:13:58.880]   We didn't see many Adams.
[00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:00.040]   There were no giveaways.
[00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:02.320]   We didn't see a new Nexus phone.
[00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:03.240]   There was no hardware announcement.
[00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:04.600]   And the Nexus 7, yeah.
[00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:05.440]   Yeah, they said--
[00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:06.440]   This is all about this.
[00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:08.160]   --this is new Samsung, where you can buy it in a Play Store
[00:14:08.160 --> 00:14:08.840]   in a month.
[00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:11.160]   Yeah, there was literally a one-minute announcement.
[00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:11.760]   Yep.
[00:14:11.760 --> 00:14:12.680]   And that was it.
[00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:13.840]   Yep.
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:17.520]   I think this is Larry continuing to step forward
[00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:20.440]   in putting his mark on this company
[00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:23.280]   and kind of setting a tone for the company
[00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:24.760]   about where he wants it to be.
[00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:25.960]   And I, for one, am excited.
[00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:27.600]   Now, I think a lot of people are going to look at this.
[00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:29.520]   And I was watching the chatroom very interestingly
[00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:31.040]   with great interest.
[00:14:31.040 --> 00:14:32.240]   We were talking-- I think a lot of people
[00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:34.360]   look at Google and say, oh, no.
[00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:36.240]   But there was so much cynicism in the chatroom.
[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:38.320]   You see, they're just gathering more information,
[00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:40.120]   just trying to find out more about us.
[00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:40.960]   They're trying to spy on us.
[00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:42.440]   They're trying to track us.
[00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:45.960]   And I think that we're rapidly seeing a gulf, a division,
[00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:49.600]   between people-- people like, say Steve Gibson, who say,
[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:51.440]   you know, you got to protect your privacy.
[00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:53.160]   I don't want anybody to know this stuff.
[00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:55.200]   And those of us, maybe more like you,
[00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:57.200]   Jeff, who say, I want to give you my information,
[00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:58.560]   because I got some real value out of this.
[00:14:58.560 --> 00:14:59.960]   Google now is a great example.
[00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:01.560]   You know, I saw a credit not jumping up
[00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:02.960]   and getting in front of those microphones
[00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:05.640]   as Robert Scoble did, because if I could ask Larry
[00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:07.320]   and it took me some time to think about it,
[00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:09.040]   if I could ask him anything, the question would be,
[00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:10.760]   why should users trust Google with their data?
[00:15:10.760 --> 00:15:11.680]   That's the question.
[00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:12.640]   Why should we trust you?
[00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:13.480]   Tell me.
[00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:14.680]   Right, because what he's done is--
[00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:15.680]   I wish you'd ask.
[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:17.240]   Yeah, I'd be-- because that's what--
[00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:18.080]   That's the question.
[00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:18.960]   Yeah, that's the question.
[00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:19.480]   It is.
[00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:20.680]   And there's two answers.
[00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:22.080]   There's two paths to the answer, right?
[00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:24.160]   The first half they've answered is because we're
[00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:25.360]   giving you value in return.
[00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:25.880]   Yes.
[00:15:25.880 --> 00:15:26.920]   The answer that is based.
[00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:27.640]   Yeah, that's clear.
[00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:30.280]   And the next part of it is they've got to clearly be a
[00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:30.560]   protector.
[00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:32.840]   Now, he was asked about a little bit of that, a kind of
[00:15:32.840 --> 00:15:34.640]   security question more.
[00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:36.440]   But Google has to become--
[00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:38.760]   it goes to do no evil.
[00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:39.520]   Don't be evil.
[00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:39.880]   Yeah.
[00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:41.400]   It goes to saying that this--
[00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:45.800]   we must trust Google or Google is screwed and so are we.
[00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:46.720]   I think he knows that.
[00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:47.600]   I mean, I think that--
[00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:48.800]   He's got to say it more.
[00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:49.440]   Yeah.
[00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:50.920]   He's got to find the ways to say--
[00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:51.480]   More than say it.
[00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:52.280]   He's got to do it.
[00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:52.560]   Exactly.
[00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:54.600]   He's got to demonstrate this.
[00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:55.440]   I think Google take out--
[00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:55.800]   Well, that's a question.
[00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:56.360]   --as an example.
[00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:59.280]   What would be an example of a way that Google could
[00:15:59.280 --> 00:15:59.920]   clearly demonstrate that?
[00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:02.640]   I think that the transparency report is a step in the
[00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:05.200]   direction of saying, look, we know we know a lot about you.
[00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:07.840]   We also know the governments want to know what we know about
[00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:07.960]   you.
[00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:11.280]   And look how we fight for you, except they don't.
[00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:13.680]   So they need to step up a little bit more there.
[00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:15.680]   They're being transparent, but they really also needed
[00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:17.160]   block more government requests.
[00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:17.600]   Yes.
[00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:18.000]   Yes.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.120]   Well, and here's the other thing too, is we see--
[00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:25.040]   And obviously, I'm a Google fanboy, but I'm most critical of
[00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:26.880]   them when they came to their doubles deal with Verizon over
[00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:28.040]   to New Traveler.
[00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:30.480]   And then today in the music thing that we'll talk about, the
[00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:33.640]   fact that they're charging $120 a year for their music
[00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:36.720]   service means to me that Hollywood--
[00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:40.080]   I said before, they've sucked up to Verizon and Telcos.
[00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:41.920]   Now they were sucking up the Hollywood.
[00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:43.440]   Well, I see that with YouTube too.
[00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:44.000]   And that's a question--
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   Exactly.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.240]   So that's the question of whom do we trust in that?
[00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:49.280]   Are they there truly to fight for us or not?
[00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:50.400]   They've got to demonstrate they are.
[00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:53.040]   They've got to give up some business because they did.
[00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:59.320]   So do you believe, Larry, now that we're in it to change
[00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:02.960]   the world and make the world a better place, to facilitate
[00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:06.880]   this transit-- he began 100 years ago or 1,000 years ago.
[00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:09.320]   We were all farmers or hunters.
[00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:11.400]   Now we're doing other things.
[00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:12.680]   And we want to facilitate that.
[00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:15.320]   We want to use technology not for itself, but to let you
[00:17:15.320 --> 00:17:16.320]   live a better life.
[00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:17.400]   I think he could--
[00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:17.960]   You think that's true?
[00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:19.440]   --contrast him with Zuckerberg.
[00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:21.720]   And I think that Larry's test is easier.
[00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:24.600]   Zuck says, it's better if we're all public.
[00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:26.280]   And by the way, I'm going to make a fortune off
[00:17:26.280 --> 00:17:27.200]   of making you public.
[00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:28.360]   I don't think it's as cynical as that,
[00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:30.720]   but it's very easy to see him as cynical.
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:35.280]   What Larry said today was, the less time we spend doing crap,
[00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:37.320]   the more time we can do good things in life.
[00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:39.120]   I absolutely believe that he believes that.
[00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:40.480]   Live, love, and learn.
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:41.400]   Live, love, and learn.
[00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:42.400]   There's the laws.
[00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:43.400]   It's so cheesy.
[00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:44.400]   Yeah, that's what Vix said.
[00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:45.560]   Live, love, and learn.
[00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:47.640]   And it was very cheesy, super cheesy, even.
[00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:48.160]   What?
[00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:48.660]   It was.
[00:17:48.660 --> 00:17:50.360]   It was also like straight-faced earnest.
[00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:50.880]   Like we would--
[00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:53.640]   Steve Jobs said, Apple sits at the intersection
[00:17:53.640 --> 00:17:56.280]   of science in the arts, of technology in the arts.
[00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:57.880]   And that's kind of what they're saying is,
[00:17:57.880 --> 00:17:59.360]   we are not a technology company.
[00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:01.440]   We're using technology to help you live--
[00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:02.600]   We're a knowledge company.
[00:18:02.600 --> 00:18:04.320]   Technology and knowledge company.
[00:18:04.320 --> 00:18:04.480]   Yeah.
[00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:08.760]   And Facebook thinks it's a technology and sociology company.
[00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:11.360]   And Twitter, I don't know what it is.
[00:18:11.360 --> 00:18:13.760]   I feel like we're seeing the beginnings of a new Google.
[00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:17.200]   And as we were walking out, we ran in a Bradford's Patrick,
[00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:20.100]   who is big part of Google+, right?
[00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:21.660]   Hold on, no, Bradley Horowitz.
[00:18:21.660 --> 00:18:22.700]   Bradley Horowitz, I'm sorry.
[00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:24.340]   If it's Patrick's takeout.
[00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:25.780]   Bradley Horowitz was there.
[00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:27.700]   And one of the things I said to him--
[00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:29.860]   and I was curious if he would agree with this--
[00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:32.020]   is it feels to me as if Google has been
[00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:35.660]   building this foundation for 10 years, disparate parts,
[00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:37.300]   that to those of us at the outside,
[00:18:37.300 --> 00:18:39.500]   we maybe didn't see how they all fit together.
[00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:41.620]   But I feel like we're starting to see--
[00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:44.260]   when we start looking at these new applications,
[00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:47.320]   I think you'll agree-- the outlines of the edifice.
[00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:50.640]   And this is, I think, where Google is going
[00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:53.160]   to have a huge head start.
[00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:56.520]   Because as soon as Apple or another company says maps
[00:18:56.520 --> 00:18:57.840]   and starts to do it, they realize,
[00:18:57.840 --> 00:18:59.960]   but we haven't been doing this for five years.
[00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:01.120]   And Google has.
[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:02.680]   And while we weren't paying attention,
[00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:07.080]   Google was building this foundation in so many areas.
[00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:10.880]   So even mobile fits into the structure, right?
[00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:12.960]   Mobile means that we know about you locally.
[00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:14.560]   We serve you relevance, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:19:14.560 --> 00:19:16.460]   And the other thing that really struck me today was,
[00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:18.260]   it's still a search company.
[00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:22.560]   The excitement-- I'm sorry, who's the head of search?
[00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:23.160]   You know.
[00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:24.160]   Nice man.
[00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:26.760]   I mean, I'm a single.
[00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:27.760]   Single.
[00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:30.760]   You know, he was even probably the most-- even more than Vic,
[00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:33.640]   he was the most gushy about how I got to build
[00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:35.960]   Star Trek search.
[00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:36.560]   Very personal.
[00:19:36.560 --> 00:19:38.280]   Showing his three-year-old picture.
[00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:41.160]   But what it was also saying was, this is very much
[00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:41.720]   a search company.
[00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:43.280]   We are moving to the next generation of search.
[00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:44.640]   You ain't seen nothing from us yet.
[00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:45.640]   Yeah.
[00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:48.080]   Search-- what was the phrase that he used?
[00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:49.720]   Search his old hat.
[00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:50.720]   It was something--
[00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:52.080]   End of search as we know it.
[00:19:52.080 --> 00:19:53.760]   End of search as we know it.
[00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:54.760]   Wow.
[00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:56.520]   For a company that is a search company,
[00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:58.160]   that's a big statement.
[00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:00.720]   F and done in our chat rooms at Google Education play--
[00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:02.160]   if education is very important too.
[00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:03.520]   We are going to talk about Google+,
[00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:06.160]   play for education, the new maps, the new mobile.
[00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:07.880]   There's a lot of new stuff to talk about.
[00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:08.360]   New developer tools.
[00:20:08.360 --> 00:20:11.360]   And developer tools, Gina, we'll talk about that too.
[00:20:11.360 --> 00:20:15.760]   IntelliJ, whatever the hell that is in just a moment.
[00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:20.120]   You're watching this week in Google, the post, Google I/O
[00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:22.840]   conversation, and really a fascinating Google I/O
[00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:24.360]   for all its length.
[00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:26.560]   And when Larry started answering questions,
[00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:28.600]   that was another, I don't know, half hour, 45 minutes.
[00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:30.640]   And Robert Scobel leaps to the front,
[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:31.880]   the first to ask a question.
[00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:33.880]   We figured he must have seen the microphone
[00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:36.080]   and actually camped out there the entire keynote--
[00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:37.040]   That's the way he thinks.
[00:20:37.040 --> 00:20:39.760]   --to be the first in line.
[00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:43.520]   But I think there was absolutely a message
[00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:45.280]   throughout this whole Google I/O.
[00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:47.680]   And I think we're seeing Google coming.
[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:48.680]   It was a coming out part.
[00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:49.680]   Yes, it was.
[00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:52.240]   This was truly Larry's company now.
[00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:54.640]   And we're starting to see his vision now.
[00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:57.160]   And that's the message to the world, I think.
[00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:59.640]   We'll talk more in just a little bit about Google,
[00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:01.400]   with Jeff Jarvis, Gina, to Panne.
[00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:03.880]   Thank you for being here on this week in Google.
[00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:07.880]   Our show today brought to you by Shutterstock.com.
[00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:10.640]   Shutterstock is a great place to get stock photos,
[00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:13.480]   illustrations, vectors, video clips.
[00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:15.320]   There's so many things to like about Shutterstock.
[00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:18.080]   First of all, 20 million high quality stock photos there.
[00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:20.720]   And many, many more all the time.
[00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:21.680]   So it's always growing.
[00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:22.680]   It's always new.
[00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:23.280]   Where's the number?
[00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:24.680]   I think they wrote it down here.
[00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:25.880]   How many new images?
[00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:26.480]   10,000 a day.
[00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:27.640]   10,000 a day.
[00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:28.640]   You're good.
[00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:29.160]   Not good at that.
[00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:30.600]   She scanned right there.
[00:21:30.600 --> 00:21:33.000]   Every day, 10,000 new images.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.320]   The thing I like is the search.
[00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:37.280]   This is a very sophisticated search tool.
[00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:38.920]   It's not just a keyword search.
[00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:40.400]   You could search for emotions.
[00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:42.280]   You could search for gender.
[00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:44.160]   You can even drill down by color.
[00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:46.720]   This spectrum wheel they have, the spectrum tool,
[00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:49.760]   lets you sort images by color spectrum.
[00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:52.880]   Not only a great way to find an image that you need to match your palette,
[00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:55.360]   but also to get inspiration and ideas.
[00:21:55.360 --> 00:21:57.040]   And that's where the light boxes come in.
[00:21:57.040 --> 00:22:00.000]   Now, you've got to create a Shutterstock account to use the light box,
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.080]   but it's free to do so.
[00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:02.880]   You don't need a credit card.
[00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:07.000]   Once you do, you can start saving images to various light boxes.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:12.080]   A great way to work with a team to share ideas, to get inspiration.
[00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:13.080]   It's even more beautiful.
[00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:15.560]   We're using it in the browser, but you've got to try the iPad app.
[00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:17.800]   If you have an iPad, download the Shutterstock app.
[00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:18.800]   It's free.
[00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:20.800]   And it's actually just beautiful.
[00:22:20.800 --> 00:22:21.680]   They want a Webby Award.
[00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:24.040]   I mean, it is truly gorgeous.
[00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:26.400]   A global company with offices all over the world,
[00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:29.720]   including Germany, China, Italy, Brazil, Belgium,
[00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:32.440]   and dedicated corporate reps in each of those countries,
[00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:36.840]   full-time customer support, all day, all week.
[00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:38.400]   I think you're going to love Shutterstock.
[00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:39.400]   I want you to visit it.
[00:22:39.400 --> 00:22:40.800]   Look at what did you search for?
[00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:42.360]   That's pretty vintage.
[00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:43.760]   Vintage.
[00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:44.560]   That's kind of cool.
[00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:45.080]   Very nice.
[00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:48.520]   Again, even just for inspiration, whether you're going to use these images or not,
[00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:49.800]   it's for the inspiration.
[00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:50.400]   I think it's great.
[00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:53.160]   If you're a designer, if you need images, if you're a blogger,
[00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:55.440]   you should have an image in every post.
[00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:56.600]   And Shutterstock makes it easy.
[00:22:56.600 --> 00:23:00.760]   They have a variety of packages you can subscribe to.
[00:23:00.760 --> 00:23:04.120]   You buy a bundle or-- I have a 25-image-a-day subscription,
[00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:05.680]   which is great for a publisher.
[00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:06.760]   You just say, I need images.
[00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:08.000]   I need images.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.600]   You can download any image in any size, pay only one price.
[00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:12.280]   I just think this is fabulous.
[00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:12.760]   Try it.
[00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:16.600]   And you can get a great deal when you use our offer code Twig5.
[00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:18.480]   When you sign up and you start making your purchases,
[00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:22.440]   use that offer code for 30% off your first purchase on a new account.
[00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:25.120]   30% off any package.
[00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:28.200]   Shutterstock.com, the offer code Twig5--
[00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:29.960]   five for the month of May.
[00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:32.520]   And we thank Shutterstock for their support.
[00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:33.960]   Of this week in Google, all right,
[00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:37.000]   we can start going through stuff.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.360]   You said something about the Sherlocking of these apps.
[00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:43.040]   I think what was interesting, unlike last year's keynote,
[00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:46.560]   where there were little snide jabs at iOS and everybody else,
[00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:49.600]   there were no real jabs to Leanne and Larry--
[00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:50.240]   More than maps.
[00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:51.400]   --got a jab at the Genibet.
[00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:52.240]   More than photos.
[00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:54.240]   --and there was a lot of things to the photo resolution.
[00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:56.320]   And the word didn't come up, but I thought all of this
[00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:59.240]   was a little jab at Facebook, in a sense, especially
[00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:00.400]   the photo stuff.
[00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:02.720]   Facebook now stores more photos than anybody else.
[00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:04.920]   They're the number one place people put photos.
[00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:06.160]   And I think this is Google saying,
[00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:09.160]   if we're going to have Google+ take off, we need to.
[00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:11.520]   And it integrates through maps because they
[00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:13.080]   use the images in maps, right?
[00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:15.040]   It integrates through your phone because the photos go up
[00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:15.560]   there straight off the app.
[00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:17.000]   All my images are up there in that.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.920]   They made a big deal of this story in full resolution,
[00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:20.920]   rather than these photos.
[00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:22.120]   50 gigabytes of full resolution.
[00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:23.360]   Full posterity.
[00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:24.920]   You want this to go on.
[00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:29.200]   One of the themes today was that things last.
[00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:31.680]   Conversations is too ethereal online.
[00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:34.520]   Twitter goes off into the ether.
[00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:37.360]   Google+ has blogs doing what they said
[00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:39.520]   or talked about it in terms of conversations lasting
[00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:40.880]   and your photos lasting.
[00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:43.600]   Google sees itself as a permanent part of your life.
[00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:45.280]   So I've got my Pixel fired up.
[00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:48.520]   This is the new-- and I just logged into my Google+
[00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:51.840]   and here's the tour of the new Google+
[00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:53.320]   that says navigate around Google+.
[00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:56.600]   Go here to visit your profile, manage photos,
[00:24:56.600 --> 00:24:57.320]   communities, and more.
[00:24:57.320 --> 00:25:00.240]   OK, we know about that.
[00:25:00.240 --> 00:25:04.480]   Bring conversations to life with Hangouts, new Hangouts app
[00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:08.360]   on Android, by the way, which replaces talk as well as iOS.
[00:25:08.360 --> 00:25:09.360]   OK.
[00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:12.880]   Send messages, share photos, and make video calls for free.
[00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:14.440]   One-on-one or with a group of friends.
[00:25:14.440 --> 00:25:18.040]   Now group video calling is free even on the phone,
[00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:20.920]   which is really interesting.
[00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:22.880]   And then make your photos look better than never.
[00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:26.360]   As you mentioned, new tools will show some of those new tools
[00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:29.840]   that can back up, organize, and the enhanced tool.
[00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:31.520]   We've seen enhanced tools before one click
[00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:33.520]   enhance iPhoto has it, Picasa has it.
[00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:34.040]   How's it has it?
[00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:34.520]   Yeah, that's--
[00:25:34.520 --> 00:25:35.000]   I feel a little bit--
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:36.360]   I feel a little bit better.
[00:25:36.360 --> 00:25:38.760]   This seems way better, like scary better.
[00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:41.080]   I feel like Trey Radcliffe had a little influence on this.
[00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:43.120]   I was expecting Trey to come out, come on, on stage.
[00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:44.560]   So I was.
[00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:46.240]   I totally was.
[00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:49.800]   So let me go to Google the home on Google+,
[00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:53.120]   and the new layout is very much a kind of Pinteresty layout.
[00:25:53.120 --> 00:25:55.720]   You remember I complained about the empty gutter
[00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:59.280]   on the right of Google+ and the misuse of space.
[00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:02.400]   I make sure I'm showing this optimally.
[00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:03.400]   I guess that's it.
[00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:05.440]   So now there's-- oh, there we go.
[00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:05.960]   There we go.
[00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:07.440]   It finally filled up the screen.
[00:26:07.440 --> 00:26:10.960]   So there's no waste of space anymore, right?
[00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:13.160]   This is a Pinterest kind of thing.
[00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:17.240]   Look at the size of that image of Pete Cashmore.
[00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:18.120]   And he's happy.
[00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:19.480]   Is he's happy about that?
[00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:22.640]   Success magazine he's featured in.
[00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:24.680]   They mentioned if there's a picture of Paris,
[00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:26.000]   it'll know that-- or the Eiffel Tower.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:26.920]   It'll know it's the Eiffel Tower.
[00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:28.520]   And you can-- how would I do that?
[00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:31.360]   Let's see if I can find a picture.
[00:26:31.360 --> 00:26:32.720]   Well search for Eiffel Tower.
[00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:36.480]   Did I-- no, it seems like I could do that from within a picture,
[00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:36.760]   right?
[00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:37.480]   I could just--
[00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:38.560]   It'll recognize places.
[00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:39.600]   I could just--
[00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:41.120]   Yeah.
[00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:42.760]   Anyway, what do you think in the new layout?
[00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:43.640]   I like this.
[00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:46.360]   To me, this is a much better use of the space.
[00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:46.860]   Yeah.
[00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:47.440]   Yeah.
[00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:47.880]   It's clean.
[00:26:47.880 --> 00:26:51.160]   It's got that Google now, that card, that card look.
[00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:53.760]   It looks responsive and that the columns kind of fill in.
[00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:57.880]   I have to say that I was pretty used to a single stream,
[00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:01.160]   and now my eye is going horizontally versus just straight
[00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:02.320]   down.
[00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:03.160]   But they talked about this.
[00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:05.640]   The new design was-- it was about depth.
[00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:07.040]   So if you can click on one of those cards
[00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:09.080]   and it'll flip around.
[00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:12.600]   And each one of the updates gets auto-hashtagged as well.
[00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:12.800]   Right.
[00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:13.400]   That's kind of--
[00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:15.760]   Which is kind of weird because when
[00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:16.960]   I talked to the folks that are delicious,
[00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:18.600]   when they started delicious, they said no, you don't want
[00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:18.600]   to do that.
[00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:20.400]   You want hashtags to be humanly.
[00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:20.920]   And heard there.
[00:27:20.920 --> 00:27:21.480]   Because then you can--
[00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:23.200]   Chads got it better than me.
[00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:24.640]   So what are the choices?
[00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:25.840]   There's this automatic hashtag.
[00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:27.480]   There's the flip around.
[00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:28.720]   It's so strange.
[00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:31.400]   We're running this on these Chromebook pixels.
[00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:34.720]   And for Gina and me using the stock Chromebook,
[00:27:34.720 --> 00:27:36.920]   it says your browser is not compatible.
[00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:37.560]   Over there you go.
[00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:38.120]   That was massive.
[00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:38.840]   But I just saw it.
[00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:41.400]   I was having trouble with mine as well on that.
[00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:43.320]   So OK, I'm puzzled.
[00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:47.040]   So what did you do, Chad?
[00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:49.200]   You clicked the down arrow in the upper right hand corner.
[00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:49.720]   Right.
[00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:50.760]   So when I-- yeah.
[00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:51.840]   So you can hit the down arrow.
[00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:52.840]   Just tags.
[00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:53.680]   Suggested tags.
[00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:55.520]   But if there is something like this,
[00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:58.640]   Droid Life-- let me manually zoom in on it here.
[00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:00.120]   They have suggested a tab.
[00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:03.320]   So they have Android because Droid Life is talking about.
[00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:03.920]   Hang out.
[00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:07.720]   And so if I click the Android tab, it will flip over.
[00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:10.520]   And that wave card becomes an Android search.
[00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:11.120]   Right.
[00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:12.320]   And so now--
[00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:13.000]   And the other--
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.160]   Now at the bottom, there are these little dots which
[00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:18.600]   show you how many articles you can flip through,
[00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:20.000]   which you flip through at the top.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:22.560]   I got to point out this would be a lot better with touch.
[00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:23.520]   It would.
[00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:24.040]   It would.
[00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:25.920]   And in fact, if I could flip this over,
[00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:28.840]   my initial reaction was to use the two-finger scroll, which
[00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:33.240]   is available on a Mac, to try to get to the next app--
[00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:34.880]   or next card, I should say.
[00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:36.040]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:37.760]   Here's what I'm not getting.
[00:28:37.760 --> 00:28:39.560]   So that's Washington Square.
[00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:40.520]   I thought, but I get that.
[00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:41.040]   I don't get it.
[00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:42.160]   You don't get it.
[00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:44.120]   I thought I would recognize the Washington Square.
[00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:44.320]   Right.
[00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:45.520]   That was really cool, right?
[00:28:45.520 --> 00:28:46.520]   They showed somebody who got it.
[00:28:46.520 --> 00:28:47.240]   That's how I wrote it.
[00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:48.240]   I know, but I click on that.
[00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:49.000]   I don't get the tags.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:49.520]   I get that.
[00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:52.120]   Right.
[00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:55.280]   Well, maybe it didn't recognize Washington Square Park.
[00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:57.200]   You have to think of that.
[00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:57.920]   I think this is nice.
[00:28:57.920 --> 00:28:58.440]   I like this.
[00:28:58.440 --> 00:28:59.080]   And I think it's just--
[00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:00.280]   Just showed up in my field.
[00:29:00.280 --> 00:29:01.280]   Somebody's taking pictures.
[00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:01.880]   What are you?
[00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:02.760]   And what are you doing?
[00:29:02.760 --> 00:29:03.120]   I'm not.
[00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:06.200]   I don't even think I'm following this person.
[00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:06.760]   But it--
[00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:08.000]   Why did it show up in your field?
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:09.440]   Oh, this is because this is the Google--
[00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:10.640]   the Twig community.
[00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:11.480]   So OK, good.
[00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:12.760]   So the post-the-Twig community.
[00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:14.280]   Correct.
[00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:18.800]   But now, Google cannot pull any information from here.
[00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:22.240]   There's no hashtag for me to click on and flip this card over.
[00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:24.320]   So you can stump it.
[00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:28.560]   But there's a lot of-- like this one is hashtag beer.
[00:29:28.560 --> 00:29:29.040]   Good.
[00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:30.160]   And now we're going to see a lot of beer.
[00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:30.920]   Right.
[00:29:30.920 --> 00:29:31.760]   Right.
[00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:33.080]   I think this is pretty novel.
[00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:34.440]   I think this is interesting.
[00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:36.480]   When you post-- actually, I guess I could do that.
[00:29:36.480 --> 00:29:39.160]   If I post here, doesn't this slide-- yeah.
[00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:40.200]   OK.
[00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:41.520]   Let me go back.
[00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:42.560]   That's Shmancy.
[00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:43.320]   Shmancy.
[00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:45.440]   It's a little day jaxie, so I'll cancel that.
[00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:46.840]   But here's Share What's New.
[00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:51.400]   So I click that, and it kind of expands out.
[00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:52.440]   I think this is nice.
[00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:55.040]   The killing thing that I thought that Vic said from my perspective
[00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:59.640]   is he said that social streams are flat, like newspapers.
[00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:00.320]   Ouch.
[00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:01.320]   That's right.
[00:30:01.320 --> 00:30:01.800]   Right?
[00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:03.320]   They say it, but this is a magazine layout.
[00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:05.240]   Not only that, but then the fact
[00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:07.080]   that there's depth behind each post potentially.
[00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:08.760]   That there's smarts on top of it,
[00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:10.120]   and there's a categorization on top of it,
[00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:12.080]   and that the conversations keep going.
[00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:12.800]   Now, you're not stuck.
[00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:14.760]   If you hate this, you can go back, I think.
[00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:17.200]   I understand, to the columnized display.
[00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:18.440]   You don't have to.
[00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:19.920]   But I personally like this.
[00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:22.880]   And given the success Pinterest has had,
[00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:25.920]   I think this is probably the right way to do it, right?
[00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:27.120]   Is this web 3.0?
[00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:29.080]   Sharpie says he's calling it web 3.0.
[00:30:29.080 --> 00:30:29.840]   It's pretty.
[00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:30.520]   Interactive web.
[00:30:30.520 --> 00:30:31.200]   It's very pretty.
[00:30:31.200 --> 00:30:33.160]   This is all HTML5, right?
[00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:36.280]   Yeah, there's a lot of flashy, flippy, you know, moving around.
[00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:36.800]   But I--
[00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:38.000]   I don't want to go too far here.
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:40.120]   I mean, it also reminds me a little bit of Facebook's latest
[00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:40.680]   root design.
[00:30:40.680 --> 00:30:41.360]   Yep.
[00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:42.160]   The new speed?
[00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:43.160]   Yep.
[00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:45.720]   It's less cluttered.
[00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:48.440]   Facebook has all sorts of little gadgets and doodads
[00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:52.440]   and ads all over that page that are missing on this page.
[00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:53.800]   I think this is pretty nice.
[00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:54.640]   When more sort of funny--
[00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:57.040]   There are any ads on there, are there?
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:30:57.800]   Do you see any ads?
[00:30:57.800 --> 00:30:58.440]   I don't see any ads.
[00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:00.400]   If there are, they are so cleverly hidden.
[00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:01.240]   I can't tell.
[00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:02.680]   Well, you know, what's funny is once you get
[00:31:02.680 --> 00:31:06.880]   to the end of your card, it relates hashtags.
[00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:08.280]   And you were interested through Glass,
[00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:09.280]   you might be interested in it.
[00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:09.760]   Right.
[00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:12.960]   And it's almost funny because you could find some comedy bits.
[00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:15.560]   And it all is a hashtag.
[00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:16.760]   Love that.
[00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:20.720]   Now then, that also brings up a point of what
[00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:23.120]   if you post content and then it gets
[00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:27.080]   unwillingly tagged to some other sort of--
[00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:27.560]   Sorry.
[00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:28.240]   Welcome to the--
[00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:28.600]   Right.
[00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:29.000]   --wide web.
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:32.080]   And that might be some--
[00:31:32.080 --> 00:31:32.800]   Get control out.
[00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:33.720]   --of people are.
[00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:34.960]   Yeah.
[00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:36.960]   In terms of--
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:37.240]   Yeah.
[00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:39.800]   --hashtag bigotry or hashtag something like that.
[00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:41.200]   People like associations, right?
[00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:43.200]   Google's just doing what people do.
[00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:45.840]   You can't control that.
[00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:48.680]   So that's in a Google+, here's why there's no ads.
[00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:51.640]   This is-- they'll not probably never be ads on this.
[00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:54.600]   This is all about getting information and gathering signals.
[00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:56.680]   They will charge companies, I think,
[00:31:56.680 --> 00:32:00.680]   to create their better positions within Google+,
[00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:02.240]   their own positions.
[00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:03.120]   Maybe the brands.
[00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:04.520]   The brands have their own brand positions,
[00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:06.120]   and they'll be charged something for something, I think,
[00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:06.480]   there.
[00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:08.080]   But ultimately, what they're getting people to do
[00:32:08.080 --> 00:32:10.600]   is put stuff into Google to use--
[00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:11.440]   Data.
[00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:12.360]   It's data.
[00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:13.480]   There's value to this.
[00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:14.480]   Google's getting value out.
[00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:16.000]   You're getting value in all kinds of levels, right?
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.800]   They're learning more about you and your interests.
[00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:19.000]   They're knowing who you're connected with
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:20.240]   and what they're interested in.
[00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:22.600]   They're learning more about content
[00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:24.280]   and what content has value to people.
[00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:24.780]   Right.
[00:32:24.780 --> 00:32:27.080]   And that all has value to Google if you're set up to do that.
[00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:28.120]   I have an argument in newspapers
[00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:29.800]   that they've got to start to learn people as people,
[00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:31.240]   as individuals, not masses.
[00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:33.440]   But they're nowhere.
[00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:34.280]   I'm just--
[00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:36.120]   She's like it in pictures, they were babies.
[00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:37.120]   I'm sorry.
[00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:40.560]   Well, no, I was testing auto in hands.
[00:32:40.560 --> 00:32:41.120]   Yeah, really.
[00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:42.120]   Oh, yeah.
[00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:43.120]   Wow.
[00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:46.640]   So the tools now are already in there for the photo--
[00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:48.120]   OK.
[00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:48.560]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:49.960]   There was a hands button in there.
[00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:50.160]   I'm sorry.
[00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:51.760]   You all can't see my screen.
[00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:53.360]   But yeah, it's subtle.
[00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:54.840]   It's a great picture.
[00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:56.480]   Yeah, that is adorable.
[00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:57.480]   Cheers.
[00:32:57.480 --> 00:32:58.480]   Thank you.
[00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:00.680]   Thank you.
[00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:02.680]   I said something to Bradley Horowitz.
[00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:03.320]   I said, you know what?
[00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:04.480]   I really want Bradley.
[00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:08.160]   You know how Facebook Home takes over the Android page?
[00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:10.160]   I would love to see Google+ have a little bit more
[00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:11.960]   prominence on the front page.
[00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:13.760]   OK, he raised his eyebrow.
[00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:16.280]   He looked at the other guy and winked.
[00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:17.800]   Pretty much gave me the thumbs up.
[00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:18.680]   What you said was--
[00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:20.600]   And he said, we'll make it better.
[00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:22.360]   Yeah, you said, I want to have the Facebook home,
[00:33:22.360 --> 00:33:23.600]   and he said, I'll make it better.
[00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:24.120]   Yeah.
[00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:24.800]   Better than that, right?
[00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:26.360]   So they're thinking along those lines.
[00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:27.160]   And of course they are.
[00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:27.960]   It makes perfect sense.
[00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:31.520]   It's not really a revelation.
[00:33:31.520 --> 00:33:33.160]   Here's my daughter.
[00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:34.840]   Aw, 16 years old and--
[00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:35.200]   Driving.
[00:33:35.200 --> 00:33:36.040]   --just as cute.
[00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:37.840]   That's the scariest moment.
[00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:40.320]   Given the keys of the car, that is a scary moment.
[00:33:40.320 --> 00:33:42.240]   All right, so there's Google+.
[00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:42.960]   Are you disappointed?
[00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:44.760]   There's no right API?
[00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:45.680]   No.
[00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:46.680]   You're not.
[00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:47.520]   This is good.
[00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:49.880]   At this point, I don't want them to give us a right API,
[00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:50.680]   because you want to--
[00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:51.360]   You want to get moved?
[00:33:51.360 --> 00:33:53.320]   Yeah, because you get people posting their tweets
[00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:54.040]   automatically.
[00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:54.960]   Yeah.
[00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:54.960]   Yeah.
[00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:55.880]   You want that?
[00:33:55.880 --> 00:33:56.680]   Yeah, I think you're right.
[00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:57.720]   I'm now to the point where I'm just
[00:33:57.720 --> 00:33:59.840]   convinced that they need to-- in order to expand Google+,
[00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:02.000]   they need to do things like comment embedding
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:04.600]   and letting people interact in other places.
[00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:06.480]   I don't think that that should be about getting people
[00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:07.680]   just dumping their content about--
[00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:09.360]   That's a comment embedding is a great thing.
[00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:10.400]   Yeah, I think that's a great thing.
[00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:10.900]   Yeah.
[00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:13.760]   So I feel like at this point, I've given up on the right API.
[00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:14.840]   Obviously, you're not going to do it.
[00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:16.400]   No.
[00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:18.240]   You said that a few months ago.
[00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:19.240]   I was just holding on.
[00:34:19.240 --> 00:34:20.200]   It was trash to up.
[00:34:20.200 --> 00:34:22.880]   And really, we've all said--
[00:34:22.880 --> 00:34:25.800]   I mean, Google+ is a great place for tech news, right?
[00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:27.560]   But our families and friends aren't quite on it.
[00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:30.040]   Well, we're talking in the car.
[00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:32.480]   When people think I hate Google+ and I actually don't,
[00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:34.040]   I love Google+.
[00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:37.400]   But nobody-- but nobody I want to see my posts.
[00:34:37.400 --> 00:34:39.240]   That's why their family isn't, my audience isn't.
[00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:39.680]   Nobody is.
[00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:42.080]   My son Jake today said, wow, this really is impressive.
[00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:43.560]   But my friends aren't there.
[00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:46.040]   Now, I have made new friends here.
[00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:46.560]   Sure.
[00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:49.800]   Right, Lauren Wenstein, I think, is an amazing guy in Google+.
[00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:50.560]   You don't look at it now.
[00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:51.920]   Tim O'Reilly is here a lot.
[00:34:51.920 --> 00:34:54.640]   There are people I know who are here a lot.
[00:34:54.640 --> 00:34:55.520]   And so I like that.
[00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:56.520]   I wish you guys were no more.
[00:34:56.520 --> 00:34:58.120]   Well, I'm going to spend more time here.
[00:34:58.120 --> 00:34:58.960]   I like it.
[00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:01.000]   I saw someone on Twitter said that they had to write a script
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.960]   that would upload all our photos to Google+, auto enhance them,
[00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:05.920]   and then post them out to Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter,
[00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:06.640]   where people would actually say--
[00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:08.120]   Well, let's talk about that, because one of the things--
[00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:09.800]   What if they did a reverse API in that way
[00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:12.200]   that I think they should actually use more promotion
[00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:14.800]   of Google+ posts on the likes of Twitter and Facebook?
[00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:15.680]   What a big plus on that.
[00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:18.880]   So that I can then draw people to Google+.
[00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:20.080]   I would like that.
[00:35:20.080 --> 00:35:20.600]   People would--
[00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:21.920]   So that you could tweet posts?
[00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:22.420]   Yeah.
[00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:24.440]   Write it on Google+ and then tweet it.
[00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:25.360]   Twitter wouldn't like it.
[00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:26.520]   But certainly, there are ways to do that.
[00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:28.880]   There's plugins that will do that, right?
[00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:31.920]   Vic showed all his pictures from his trip.
[00:35:31.920 --> 00:35:32.920]   Yeah, Vic, really.
[00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:34.920]   He gave us a window into his lights.
[00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:37.560]   So many companies, even Google, solve problems that don't exist.
[00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:40.520]   I think Glass is an example of solving a problem that doesn't exist.
[00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:42.200]   But there is a problem that really exists
[00:35:42.200 --> 00:35:43.880]   with anybody who takes pictures, which is there's too many
[00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:45.200]   and you don't have time to go through them.
[00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:47.800]   I still have pictures from my trip to Australia a year ago.
[00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:48.760]   They haven't gone through.
[00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:50.520]   You haven't gone through them, picked out the best ones, right?
[00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:51.520]   So Google's automated that.
[00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:53.720]   Is it credible that they could do a good job of that?
[00:35:53.720 --> 00:35:54.520]   I don't know.
[00:35:54.520 --> 00:35:56.080]   I got to see this to believe it.
[00:35:56.080 --> 00:35:58.640]   But they use certain criteria to sort out the highlights
[00:35:58.640 --> 00:36:00.520]   of your best pictures, which are pretty obvious, right?
[00:36:00.520 --> 00:36:02.920]   Blurry pictures I've lost out, right?
[00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:05.920]   They do facial recognition or people smiling.
[00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:06.920]   That's interesting.
[00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:07.920]   Which is amazing.
[00:36:07.920 --> 00:36:09.400]   A good picture doesn't mean people are smiling, by the way.
[00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:10.400]   I agree.
[00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:11.400]   I agree.
[00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:12.400]   But they're making a presumption about that.
[00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:15.560]   They also, they were as subtle as they could possibly be to say
[00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:17.760]   they're involving facial recognition as well.
[00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:20.640]   Because if you know your own family, they're going to emphasize that.
[00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:23.680]   Because they know who your family is or are.
[00:36:23.680 --> 00:36:28.080]   And then it just creates this great page with your highlight pictures.
[00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:30.040]   And if you want to see the rest of them, they're still there.
[00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:31.040]   They're not gone.
[00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:32.040]   You can see the rest, right?
[00:36:32.040 --> 00:36:33.040]   So they weed out duplicates.
[00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:34.040]   That's awesome.
[00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:37.760]   They also recognize landmarks and recognize, well, that's your photo of the iPhone Tower
[00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:40.440]   is if we needed one more, but fun.
[00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:42.440]   I think it's very important.
[00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:47.400]   And I tweeted at the time, I said, if Kodak weren't already dead, this would kill him.
[00:36:47.400 --> 00:36:48.400]   You know, if you thought--
[00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:49.400]   But it's aimed at Facebook.
[00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:50.400]   But it's aimed at Facebook.
[00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:51.400]   This is aimed at Facebook.
[00:36:51.400 --> 00:36:54.320]   Because Facebook is the place people put their photos right now.
[00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:57.680]   And they don't do anything this useful for you.
[00:36:57.680 --> 00:36:59.120]   Plus, I have auto upload.
[00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:00.880]   Facebook has auto upload as well, by the way.
[00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:01.880]   I might point out with your app.
[00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:03.480]   Because that's the key, Leo.
[00:37:03.480 --> 00:37:06.440]   Google sees itself as a service company.
[00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:07.840]   Facebook doesn't, right?
[00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:10.040]   So Google's trying to invent new services.
[00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:14.040]   And that, by the way, is the ethos that Marissa takes away with her to Yahoo.
[00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:16.440]   That's where the uninteresting war comes in.
[00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:18.240]   So I've just gone on my photo page.
[00:37:18.240 --> 00:37:19.240]   It says, what does that say?
[00:37:19.240 --> 00:37:20.240]   All your photos, I can barely read my screen.
[00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:21.240]   It's in the organizing.
[00:37:21.240 --> 00:37:22.240]   Yeah.
[00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:23.240]   Yeah.
[00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:24.240]   Those who don't understand, Leo is--
[00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:25.240]   The few of the best.
[00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:27.920]   --image on a monitor that's six feet away.
[00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:28.920]   And he's old.
[00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:31.120]   I'm simulating Google Glass.
[00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:33.840]   When you have a lot of photos, we'll start you off with a few of the best.
[00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:34.760]   See photos from you.
[00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:39.280]   So these are pictures that I took on the Nexus One and the--
[00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:41.280]   Look at the movement down there.
[00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:42.280]   Right.
[00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:43.280]   That HTC One.
[00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:44.280]   Yeah.
[00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:45.280]   That's because that's a Zoe from the HTC One.
[00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:46.280]   Oh, you did that.
[00:37:46.280 --> 00:37:47.280]   OK.
[00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:49.840]   It means it was smart enough to preserve that.
[00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:50.840]   Add new photos.
[00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:52.400]   Yeah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:54.400]   So this is giving me a little tour.
[00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:55.400]   It's a highlight.
[00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:56.840]   It's getting overview, exploring new futures.
[00:37:56.840 --> 00:38:01.280]   So what's nice is it did pick pictures that I took from Google I/O.
[00:38:01.280 --> 00:38:02.280]   That's what these are.
[00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:05.200]   Decided which of the highlights are.
[00:38:05.200 --> 00:38:06.520]   Some of these are with the HTC One.
[00:38:06.520 --> 00:38:07.520]   Those are the Zoes.
[00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:09.280]   And that's why there's some movement in those.
[00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:11.560]   But what I also like is it made bigger a couple--
[00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:12.560]   Yeah.
[00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:13.560]   --actually two of the better images that I saw.
[00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:14.560]   You did.
[00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:15.560]   I hate to say it, but--
[00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:16.560]   It also takes a couple--
[00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:18.040]   --actually are the two better pictures.
[00:38:18.040 --> 00:38:19.040]   Yeah.
[00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:20.360]   It takes into account aesthetics as well.
[00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:21.360]   So there's a--
[00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:22.360]   Apparently, that's better taste than I do.
[00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:23.360]   Yeah.
[00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:26.960]   There's blurriness, duplicates, affinity, people who you know, landmarks.
[00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:31.400]   But they also do aesthetics, which is like it'll try to recognize well-composed photos,
[00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:34.680]   like photos that human beings consider attractive for whatever reason.
[00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:36.480]   And you'll notice that those two photos there at the top are actually--
[00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:37.480]   They are much more attractive.
[00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:40.480]   --were actually kind of artsy, attractive photos.
[00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:41.480]   Damn.
[00:38:41.480 --> 00:38:45.960]   So those little animated deals, those Zoes, it will also do that.
[00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:48.560]   If you take several photos of someone that are very similar, it'll--
[00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:50.720]   So this is one of the things I--
[00:38:50.720 --> 00:38:56.400]   The HTC One falls short in a number of ways, mostly because HTC oversensified it.
[00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:59.120]   But the camera is spectacular.
[00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:01.240]   And it does these-- and I usually do it by default--
[00:39:01.240 --> 00:39:04.560]   Zoes, which are three seconds, 20 images.
[00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:06.920]   There's a movie plus 20 images.
[00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:11.640]   And what I'm very pleased to see is that Google+ got smart about the Zoes because it
[00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:13.880]   used to have 20 images.
[00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:17.200]   And I don't know if it's-- I'm not sure what it's doing here, but it's obviously figured
[00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:18.200]   out that those are--
[00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:19.200]   Is it a--
[00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:20.200]   Zoes.
[00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:21.200]   It's a GIF?
[00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:22.200]   No, no, no.
[00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:25.480]   It's a-- it makes a movie and-- now, it looks like a GIF, doesn't it?
[00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:26.480]   Because the frame rate's very low.
[00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:28.240]   Because it's a-- yeah, the frame rate.
[00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:29.720]   That's you and Stephen Levy, right?
[00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:31.520]   Yeah, it's Jeff and Stephen.
[00:39:31.520 --> 00:39:32.520]   Oh, yeah.
[00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:34.360]   And there's a guy walking through the picture.
[00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:36.320]   They should have really gotten rid of that one.
[00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:38.240]   So highlights looks pretty good.
[00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:39.240]   This is definitely something people do.
[00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:40.240]   I like this.
[00:39:40.240 --> 00:39:41.240]   Those are the two best pictures.
[00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:44.440]   It also means you're going to take more pictures and take more pictures Google likes,
[00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:45.440]   too.
[00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:46.440]   Right.
[00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:47.440]   Right.
[00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:48.440]   Because you have to do more concurating them.
[00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:49.440]   Yeah.
[00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:53.320]   And then there's auto-enhance, which Vic showed us.
[00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:57.200]   So these are the auto-- Stephen's saying these are the auto Google GIFs that I'm seeing.
[00:39:57.200 --> 00:39:59.840]   But I think they are from the Zoes.
[00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:00.840]   So it's--
[00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:02.840]   Ah, so Google is getting the same image.
[00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:04.760]   It's making a Zoe out of full-lineage, right?
[00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:06.280]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:40:06.280 --> 00:40:07.280]   This is the best picture.
[00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:08.280]   They really should have highlighted this one.
[00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:09.280]   I don't know.
[00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:10.280]   I don't understand.
[00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:11.280]   Wait a minute.
[00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:12.280]   Enhance your photo.
[00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:13.280]   Should I enhance this?
[00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:14.280]   Sure.
[00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:15.280]   All right.
[00:40:15.280 --> 00:40:16.280]   Share with the right people.
[00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:17.280]   This is where you're still in the tour.
[00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:18.720]   So will it tag me?
[00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:19.720]   Take people for quicker show.
[00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:20.720]   I have to tag you.
[00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:22.760]   So I think it's in more auto-enhance.
[00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:23.760]   All right.
[00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:24.760]   Let's see.
[00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:25.760]   Which is strange.
[00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:26.760]   More auto-enhance.
[00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:27.760]   All right.
[00:40:27.760 --> 00:40:28.760]   Get ready, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:40:28.760 --> 00:40:29.760]   In three, auto-enhance.
[00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:30.760]   Or auto-enhance.
[00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:31.760]   Sutter.
[00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:32.760]   Enhance.
[00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:33.760]   Sutter.
[00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:34.760]   Enhance.
[00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:35.760]   It's--
[00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:36.760]   Ooh.
[00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:37.760]   No, it's still working.
[00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:38.760]   Working.
[00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:40.680]   Back up a little bit.
[00:40:40.680 --> 00:40:42.680]   And you can see the-- there it is.
[00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:44.240]   Now it's done.
[00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:45.240]   What?
[00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:46.240]   Infinitely better.
[00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:47.240]   What's wrinkles?
[00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:48.240]   Oh, yeah.
[00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:50.120]   I've lost ten years.
[00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:53.920]   My son is smooth and soft.
[00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:54.920]   Huh.
[00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:55.920]   All right.
[00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:58.560]   And then we can-- I presume we can undo and so forth.
[00:40:58.560 --> 00:40:59.560]   Cool.
[00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:02.600]   And then, of course, I'd want to tag these.
[00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:03.600]   It says enhanced.
[00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:04.600]   That's nice.
[00:41:04.600 --> 00:41:05.600]   It's showing me that it wasn't enhanced.
[00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:06.600]   So it did it?
[00:41:06.600 --> 00:41:07.600]   Yeah.
[00:41:07.600 --> 00:41:08.600]   Sort of tag them.
[00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:09.600]   It doesn't-- or do I recognition on you?
[00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:10.600]   No.
[00:41:10.600 --> 00:41:11.600]   I have to tag them by hand, I think.
[00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:12.600]   I know.
[00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:13.600]   I mean, that's one of the-- I'm sure they could.
[00:41:13.600 --> 00:41:14.600]   Oh, they-- you know they could.
[00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:15.600]   No one of the things that they--
[00:41:15.600 --> 00:41:16.600]   No, they're recognizing landmarks.
[00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:17.600]   They're recognizing landmarks.
[00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:19.920]   And I could add this to an album.
[00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:23.320]   Yeah, they make the point that they are recognizing human faces and that they've been
[00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:24.320]   yet them.
[00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:25.320]   Right.
[00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:27.240]   And they soften skin and do red eye--
[00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:28.240]   Red eye reduction.
[00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:29.240]   --red eye reduction.
[00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:30.240]   --red eye reduction.
[00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:33.840]   And they've been yet photos to put the emphasis on faces.
[00:41:33.840 --> 00:41:37.160]   So there's quite a bit of facial recognition going on.
[00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:38.480]   So this is the highlights tab.
[00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:39.480]   That's a new tab.
[00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:41.240]   And then you can look at all photos, albums.
[00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:43.120]   What's under more here?
[00:41:43.120 --> 00:41:44.120]   Auto backup.
[00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:45.120]   Auto backup.
[00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:46.120]   Oh, you're--
[00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:47.120]   This is great.
[00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:51.320]   I'd say this is pretty compelling given that I did not push a single button.
[00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:52.320]   These I just took these images.
[00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:54.720]   I have Google+ Auto upload turned on.
[00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:55.720]   Yep.
[00:41:55.720 --> 00:41:57.040]   And by the way, let's be clear.
[00:41:57.040 --> 00:41:58.720]   They're all private until you choose to share them.
[00:41:58.720 --> 00:41:59.720]   Yeah, none of these are public events.
[00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:02.680]   One of the reasons I'm not scrolling down any lower.
[00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:03.680]   I have no idea.
[00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:04.680]   But be tuned show us what's going on about the full--
[00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:06.880]   No idea what happened yesterday.
[00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:09.000]   And I'm not sure-- you know, my history.
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   I'd probably bet that I did not--
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:11.680]   Would you share the one of the three of us, please?
[00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:12.680]   Shall I share that?
[00:42:12.680 --> 00:42:13.680]   Yeah, share that.
[00:42:13.680 --> 00:42:16.280]   Well, let's see what that experience is like.
[00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:17.440]   So I'm going to go back here.
[00:42:17.440 --> 00:42:19.400]   I'm going to click the share button.
[00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:20.720]   Scroll up, I think.
[00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:21.720]   Oh, there it is.
[00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:23.640]   Uh, share this photo.
[00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:28.360]   Of course, only on Google+, can I-- is that the tagging?
[00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:30.520]   Oh, that's who I know.
[00:42:30.520 --> 00:42:32.280]   But I don't have to do that because I know who you are.
[00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:40.040]   So if I put Gina plus Gina and then tab?
[00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:40.360]   No.
[00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:40.880]   No, you just--
[00:42:40.880 --> 00:42:41.960]   You just click here.
[00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:42.600]   Enter?
[00:42:42.600 --> 00:42:44.280]   No, not enter.
[00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:44.760]   Really?
[00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:45.840]   Yeah.
[00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:47.000]   Really enter?
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:48.560]   Plus, Gina.
[00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:49.680]   Stood again.
[00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:51.480]   Plus, Gina.
[00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:52.320]   God damn it.
[00:42:52.320 --> 00:42:54.160]   You did control.
[00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:55.520]   That might as plus.
[00:42:55.520 --> 00:42:56.880]   I'm sorry about all the profanity.
[00:42:56.880 --> 00:42:57.720]   Now what?
[00:42:57.720 --> 00:42:58.360]   Click.
[00:42:58.360 --> 00:42:59.120]   Enter, enter.
[00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:01.520]   Enter?
[00:43:01.520 --> 00:43:05.040]   Plus, Jeff.
[00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:06.920]   See, the kids these days, you really
[00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:11.120]   know how to use that social networking thing.
[00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:16.080]   And me at Google, I--
[00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:17.080]   Oops.
[00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:18.080]   Google.
[00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:18.600]   Hi.
[00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:19.120]   Hi.
[00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:20.120]   Oh.
[00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:20.880]   Oh.
[00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:23.880]   And now it added interesting, added that, which is--
[00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:25.040]   I think it always does that, doesn't it?
[00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:25.800]   As your name.
[00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:26.300]   Yeah.
[00:43:26.300 --> 00:43:28.240]   If I can rewire that, you cannot take them out.
[00:43:28.240 --> 00:43:30.400]   If you measure something, because we'll see that you mentioned--
[00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:32.520]   Now I have to see that you mentioned.
[00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:33.480]   This is nice.
[00:43:33.480 --> 00:43:35.040]   Chad, can you-- I can't see.
[00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:37.040]   Yeah, hit control zero again.
[00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:37.480]   There we go.
[00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:38.040]   There we go.
[00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:38.720]   There we go.
[00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:40.040]   I made it big.
[00:43:40.040 --> 00:43:41.040]   Yeah, I made it big.
[00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:42.040]   Yeah, we'll zoomed it in.
[00:43:42.040 --> 00:43:43.040]   There we go.
[00:43:43.040 --> 00:43:44.040]   There we go.
[00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:45.040]   There we go.
[00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:46.040]   There we go.
[00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:47.040]   There we go.
[00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:48.040]   There we go.
[00:43:48.040 --> 00:43:49.040]   There we go.
[00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:50.040]   There we go.
[00:43:50.040 --> 00:43:51.040]   So, no more straight down on this.
[00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:52.040]   Google's data center is your dark room.
[00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:53.040]   That was the company line.
[00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:54.040]   That was the company line.
[00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:55.040]   That was the company line.
[00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:56.040]   That was the company line.
[00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:57.040]   That was the company line.
[00:43:57.040 --> 00:43:58.040]   That was the company line.
[00:43:58.040 --> 00:43:59.040]   That was the dark room as you did.
[00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:00.040]   Yeah.
[00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:01.040]   That is your dark room.
[00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:02.040]   And I can even have a little slideshow.
[00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:03.040]   So we get 15 gigabytes of restorages.
[00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:04.040]   50, which is a copy.
[00:44:04.040 --> 00:44:05.040]   15.
[00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:06.040]   Yeah, up from five.
[00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:07.040]   Oh, mine with--
[00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:08.040]   Did I?
[00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:10.040]   Yeah, they combined a couple of counts into 115.
[00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:11.040]   150.
[00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:12.040]   That's why I want to scroll down.
[00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:13.040]   That's why I want to scroll down.
[00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:14.040]   That's my son sitting in a bean bag.
[00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:15.040]   We didn't really want to show that on the--
[00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:19.040]   Hey, hey, hey!
[00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:21.040]   Protect the private photos.
[00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:22.040]   Protect the private photos.
[00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:24.040]   It could have been a lot worse.
[00:44:24.040 --> 00:44:25.040]   Okay.
[00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:27.040]   Back to Google Plus.
[00:44:27.040 --> 00:44:29.040]   So that's all the new features of Google Plus.
[00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:31.040]   That's the new Google Photos.
[00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:33.040]   And there's the share.
[00:44:33.040 --> 00:44:34.040]   That's nice.
[00:44:34.040 --> 00:44:35.040]   You re-shared.
[00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:36.040]   I guess.
[00:44:36.040 --> 00:44:37.040]   Yeah.
[00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:38.040]   Okay.
[00:44:38.040 --> 00:44:40.040]   Let's take a break.
[00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:41.040]   Come back.
[00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:42.040]   We're going to talk about maps.
[00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:44.040]   There's Larry talking right there.
[00:44:44.040 --> 00:44:47.040]   Harry McCracken's picture of Larry on stage.
[00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:50.040]   There's nothing life-threatening about his paralysis.
[00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:51.040]   No, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:52.040]   Apparently at all.
[00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:55.040]   It's just-- he got a virus or a cold when he was a kid.
[00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:56.040]   He came back out of it.
[00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:59.040]   And one vocal chord was partly paralyzed.
[00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:01.040]   And then that happened again about a year and a half ago.
[00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:02.040]   And that's what happened.
[00:45:02.040 --> 00:45:03.040]   Okay.
[00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:04.040]   So you're just tuning in.
[00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:08.400]   And we are running a little bit differently on the schedule because we just got back from
[00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:12.160]   Google I/O in our live coverage this morning, which will be on the Twitch specials feed
[00:45:12.160 --> 00:45:14.280]   any minute now.
[00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:18.280]   Coming up though, in about one hour, Douglas Rushkoff joins us on triangulation.
[00:45:18.280 --> 00:45:20.040]   So that's going to be good.
[00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:21.800]   So stick around for that.
[00:45:21.800 --> 00:45:25.240]   Our show today brought to you by our friends at Toucows.
[00:45:25.240 --> 00:45:26.240]   The ultimate-- remember them?
[00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:28.320]   The ultimate collection of Windows software.
[00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:34.280]   Elliot Noss, who runs Toucows, has decided that their job is to find businesses that are
[00:45:34.280 --> 00:45:37.280]   run crappily and fix them.
[00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:41.960]   We talked about Ting, better cell phone service, hover.com, perfect example.
[00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:44.320]   Domain name management done the right way.
[00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:48.800]   If you visit hover.com/twig, you get an idea of what I mean.
[00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:53.120]   Hover believes that it's important that everybody take control of their online identity.
[00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:56.400]   And the best way to do that is to have your domain name.
[00:45:56.400 --> 00:46:01.600]   With your email going to your domain name-- and Hover takes all the hassle out of that-- both
[00:46:01.600 --> 00:46:06.360]   registering, owning, managing your domains with smart, easy to use, friction-free and
[00:46:06.360 --> 00:46:09.920]   powerful domain name management tools.
[00:46:09.920 --> 00:46:13.960]   If you go to hover.com/twig, you'll see it's clean, it's simple.
[00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:18.200]   There's no upselling, no aggressive cross selling.
[00:46:18.200 --> 00:46:20.600]   There's no extra payments hidden behind the scenes.
[00:46:20.600 --> 00:46:24.560]   For instance, when you register a domain name and hover, you get who is privacy as part
[00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:25.800]   of the deal.
[00:46:25.800 --> 00:46:27.400]   No upsell on that.
[00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:29.840]   And by the way, you do want who is privacy.
[00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:39.760]   They offer all the big names.com.net.org.tv/pro/moby-bizcountrycodes2 like.ca.asia.us.uk.
[00:46:39.760 --> 00:46:43.120]   Now a lot of times you go there and you search for fancypants.com.
[00:46:43.120 --> 00:46:44.480]   What are you searching for?
[00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:46.240]   Google.io.com.
[00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:47.240]   Somebody's got it.
[00:46:47.240 --> 00:46:49.160]   I don't know who would have that.
[00:46:49.160 --> 00:46:50.160]   Wait a minute.
[00:46:50.160 --> 00:46:51.160]   Whoa.
[00:46:51.160 --> 00:46:52.160]   What?
[00:46:52.160 --> 00:46:53.160]   It's available.
[00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:54.160]   No, it's misspelled.
[00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:55.160]   You missed an L.
[00:46:55.160 --> 00:46:58.160]   Chad is dyslexia.
[00:46:58.160 --> 00:47:00.160]   It serves us every day.
[00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:03.160]   It's snapping up domains.
[00:47:03.160 --> 00:47:05.160]   It's snapping up Gugel.io.
[00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:06.160]   Gugel.
[00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:07.560]   That'll be great someday.
[00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:08.560]   Someone will.
[00:47:08.560 --> 00:47:10.920]   Somebody will like Gugel.io.
[00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:12.120]   So one thing.
[00:47:12.120 --> 00:47:13.120]   Gugelio.
[00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:15.040]   Googlyeyes.com is available.
[00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:16.040]   That's a premium domain.
[00:47:16.040 --> 00:47:17.040]   Google.io.co.
[00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:18.040]   Google.io.me.
[00:47:18.040 --> 00:47:21.720]   But you'll notice that a lot of times a.net is available.
[00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:23.080]   If you do, just a little tip.
[00:47:23.080 --> 00:47:25.680]   If you're searching for the.com, go for the.net.
[00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:29.880]   That's pretty much just as recognizable nowadays is.com and just as good.
[00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:33.000]   Hover has great support online and off.
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:36.880]   When you call, you'll get no hold, no wait, no transfer phone support.
[00:47:36.880 --> 00:47:39.720]   During regular business hours, you'll be speaking to a live person empowered and eager
[00:47:39.720 --> 00:47:40.720]   to help.
[00:47:40.720 --> 00:47:46.320]   They've got great online help too with forums, tutorials, support documentation.
[00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:51.120]   They've been around since 1994 and they're one of the largest domain name registrars
[00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:52.120]   in the world.
[00:47:52.120 --> 00:47:54.480]   And they're only with a great company and a great service.
[00:47:54.480 --> 00:47:55.680]   I highly recommend it.
[00:47:55.680 --> 00:47:57.120]   I transferred all my domains over.
[00:47:57.120 --> 00:47:58.280]   They did that for free, by the way.
[00:47:58.280 --> 00:48:01.480]   You ask them, say Leo said you do the domain name concierge service.
[00:48:01.480 --> 00:48:03.480]   No matter they charge 25 bucks.
[00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:05.400]   Chat is dyslexic.com is available.
[00:48:05.400 --> 00:48:06.400]   Just 15 dollars.
[00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:08.400]   Chad, you should book that.
[00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:10.400]   I just bought it.
[00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:11.400]   No.
[00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:12.400]   What are you going to do with that?
[00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:15.400]   The redirected to my normal account.
[00:48:15.400 --> 00:48:18.880]   Yeah, there you go.
[00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:20.560]   What was I saying?
[00:48:20.560 --> 00:48:22.160]   Oh, I moved all my domains over.
[00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:25.880]   Now that's a $25 fee, but they've been waving it.
[00:48:25.880 --> 00:48:29.520]   So if you just say, hey, Leo on Twitch said that you wouldn't charge me to move my domain
[00:48:29.520 --> 00:48:30.520]   names over.
[00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:35.320]   Now what they do, they do charge you per domain $10, but you get a whole mother year, plus
[00:48:35.320 --> 00:48:36.320]   the who is privacy and everything.
[00:48:36.320 --> 00:48:38.240]   So it's a very good deal, I think.
[00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:39.240]   Hover.com/twig.
[00:48:39.240 --> 00:48:44.360]   Give it a try today and use the offer code twig and you'll get 10% off your new domain
[00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:46.080]   name or names.
[00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:49.040]   Register a whole bunch of them in all at once.
[00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:51.360]   Thank you, Hover, for your support on this week in Google.
[00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:53.360]   All right, so you're looking at your notes, Gina.
[00:48:53.360 --> 00:48:54.360]   What else?
[00:48:54.360 --> 00:48:57.160]   We kind of jumped ahead to Google+, because I think that's important.
[00:48:57.160 --> 00:48:58.160]   Yeah.
[00:48:58.160 --> 00:48:59.160]   Let's talk about Google for Education.
[00:48:59.160 --> 00:49:01.960]   This is a new play store.
[00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:04.800]   Play store initiative, yeah.
[00:49:04.800 --> 00:49:09.240]   So it looked like you could buy, they said, you know, Google's, one of Google's missions
[00:49:09.240 --> 00:49:13.200]   is to get devices into the hands of kids in schools.
[00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:17.040]   They said that they talk to teachers, Google talk to teachers and found out there's a
[00:49:17.040 --> 00:49:23.440]   big gap between what's possible and what's practical was the words that they use.
[00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:24.760]   Portable is probably the right word.
[00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:26.760]   Portable is probably the right word.
[00:49:26.760 --> 00:49:27.760]   But they did a quick demo.
[00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:30.280]   It looks like you can easily purchase educational apps.
[00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:32.640]   Well, first they're organizing the play store by grades.
[00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:37.560]   They had kindergarten through several grades and so you could go and see curated collections
[00:49:37.560 --> 00:49:41.560]   of apps, which apparently are educational apps that are approved by teachers.
[00:49:41.560 --> 00:49:43.720]   And then you can purchase like multiple licenses.
[00:49:43.720 --> 00:49:48.280]   You can say, let me buy 30 copies of this app with one purchase order, say from an education
[00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:52.760]   system and install and I'll just get pushed down to all the students, students tablets
[00:49:52.760 --> 00:49:55.280]   or devices, which look really, really, really cool.
[00:49:55.280 --> 00:49:58.440]   And you do the same with YouTube videos and books as well.
[00:49:58.440 --> 00:50:01.920]   Somebody pointed out in the chat room, this was Apple, traditionally Apple's realm.
[00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:02.920]   And Apple, I think--
[00:50:02.920 --> 00:50:03.920]   I think it's--
[00:50:03.920 --> 00:50:04.920]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:50:04.920 --> 00:50:05.920]   --a new education.
[00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:06.920]   I guess they do.
[00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:12.160]   You know, my experiences with our high school that my kids went to, actually Henry's a senior,
[00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:15.640]   he's still there, and they have what they call a one-to-one program.
[00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:17.680]   As you enter in a freshman year, you get a laptop.
[00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:19.760]   And for years, it's been a MacBook.
[00:50:19.760 --> 00:50:23.920]   And last year, there was no discount on MacBooks.
[00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:26.480]   For the school, they talked to a rep.
[00:50:26.480 --> 00:50:29.240]   They're upset, all right, I grudgingly gave them a discount.
[00:50:29.240 --> 00:50:31.960]   Now they're buying Lenovo Windows laptops.
[00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:32.960]   Ooh.
[00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:33.960]   Ooh.
[00:50:33.960 --> 00:50:34.960]   Ooh.
[00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:35.960]   And I know, that was my reaction.
[00:50:35.960 --> 00:50:36.960]   I know you're going to recommend it.
[00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:37.960]   Pro-boxed.
[00:50:37.960 --> 00:50:38.960]   Pro-boxed, yes.
[00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:39.960]   Well, I'm thinking not pixels, but maybe Chromebooks.
[00:50:39.960 --> 00:50:40.960]   Pro-boxed.
[00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:41.960]   --the tablets.
[00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:45.960]   But here's the thing, though, that's kids playing games and chatting and doing stuff.
[00:50:45.960 --> 00:50:46.960]   And control it.
[00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:47.960]   You can control it.
[00:50:47.960 --> 00:50:53.360]   But the other--we saw Sundo Pichai up there now in charge of both Chrome and Android, not
[00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:54.360]   to go off here.
[00:50:54.360 --> 00:50:58.880]   But really, that's where the education news struck me, that it's a shame that here you
[00:50:58.880 --> 00:51:02.200]   have Google pushing this Play Store for Android apps.
[00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:05.360]   What if your class is all on Chromebooks?
[00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:09.440]   You don't have that same--they ought to be able to go across platform for apps too.
[00:51:09.440 --> 00:51:10.440]   And they're not there yet.
[00:51:10.440 --> 00:51:11.440]   There's a tension.
[00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:13.440]   And they kind of took it head on.
[00:51:13.440 --> 00:51:18.720]   They said, we've got two huge open platforms that we're working on right now.
[00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:20.800]   And they kind of switched back between Chrome and Android.
[00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:23.800]   And I agree, a Chromebook would be a perfect device for a student.
[00:51:23.800 --> 00:51:25.960]   But what they demoed were Android play apps.
[00:51:25.960 --> 00:51:26.960]   They're talking about tablets.
[00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:30.600]   And the images they were showing are really cute kids holding tablets, right, exactly.
[00:51:30.600 --> 00:51:35.840]   But you know, it was interesting in the end, during the Q&A, Larry Page did say developers
[00:51:35.840 --> 00:51:38.040]   should not have to think about what platform they're developing for.
[00:51:38.040 --> 00:51:40.040]   I think cross-platforms are going to be a big--
[00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:41.040]   You should do right ones run anywhere.
[00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:42.040]   You should have a big story.
[00:51:42.040 --> 00:51:46.760]   Somebody asked whether Chrome was the platform in the sense that Chrome also runs on Android.
[00:51:46.760 --> 00:51:47.760]   But it's not there.
[00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:48.760]   But that was someone from Mozilla.
[00:51:48.760 --> 00:51:49.760]   Exactly.
[00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:50.760]   Linux is the platform.
[00:51:50.760 --> 00:51:54.960]   Linux is the platform, really, in Java.
[00:51:54.960 --> 00:52:01.040]   Even though cross-platform--and I saw this in the gaming part, to the point where it's
[00:52:01.040 --> 00:52:02.440]   iOS included as well.
[00:52:02.440 --> 00:52:03.880]   And I'm interested in that.
[00:52:03.880 --> 00:52:05.280]   I think Google has a foothold in iOS.
[00:52:05.280 --> 00:52:07.280]   There were a lot of iOS releases.
[00:52:07.280 --> 00:52:09.120]   Hangouts got released on iOS, right?
[00:52:09.120 --> 00:52:11.080]   They talked about how Google now got released on iOS.
[00:52:11.080 --> 00:52:16.440]   There was one slide where it was the Android robot and the Apple right up there together.
[00:52:16.440 --> 00:52:21.560]   The cross-platformness of Hangouts was one of the big part of the story.
[00:52:21.560 --> 00:52:24.360]   You should not have to think about what client your friends are using to send them
[00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:25.360]   in a message.
[00:52:25.360 --> 00:52:28.120]   And that's a good story compared to Apple's messages, which is iOS only.
[00:52:28.120 --> 00:52:31.240]   BBM, which will someday be iOS and Android.
[00:52:31.240 --> 00:52:32.240]   They've announced that.
[00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:35.080]   part of Larry's interoperability speech that he gave the
[00:52:35.080 --> 00:52:36.500]   end. And then clearly, this is something that's important to
[00:52:36.500 --> 00:52:37.200]   him. It's on his mind.
[00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:40.020]   Rightly so. Because who cares. Goggles, and Larry said, you
[00:52:40.020 --> 00:52:42.080]   shouldn't have to think about what operating system you're
[00:52:42.080 --> 00:52:43.340]   using. Why is that relevant?
[00:52:43.340 --> 00:52:45.080]   Why did a lot of developers have to care about this?
[00:52:45.080 --> 00:52:45.680]   Shouldn't care.
[00:52:45.680 --> 00:52:46.000]   Yeah.
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:46.840]   VEL to use?
[00:52:46.840 --> 00:52:49.840]   It's its its disappointment of his hunting your food down.
[00:52:49.840 --> 00:52:51.400]   Lino.
[00:52:51.400 --> 00:52:57.240]   Slingshotting that rabbit trying to hunt that couple of coffee
[00:52:57.240 --> 00:52:59.760]   ran away.
[00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:01.080]   It was faster than me.
[00:53:01.320 --> 00:53:01.800]   Ah.
[00:53:01.800 --> 00:53:06.760]   So education, I think the smart place for them to be. We'll
[00:53:06.760 --> 00:53:08.680]   see what they do with them. Let's talk about games. They've
[00:53:08.680 --> 00:53:11.800]   got a game center that looks a lot like in some ways, Apple's
[00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:15.600]   Game Center in some ways, like Xbox Live, the ability to run
[00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:21.040]   servers that start games that others can join. The fact that
[00:53:21.040 --> 00:53:23.680]   you can't across devices hold on to your status.
[00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:24.480]   Yes, cloud.
[00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:28.040]   Yeah, game state and a player progression. You can start on
[00:53:28.040 --> 00:53:30.400]   your phone and grab a leaderboards. That's all game
[00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:31.400]   center stuff.
[00:53:31.400 --> 00:53:32.600]   Apple game center stuff.
[00:53:32.600 --> 00:53:36.080]   That's also for iOS and web and Android. So we heard iOS
[00:53:36.080 --> 00:53:38.720]   web Android for a couple of times a multiplayer than the
[00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:41.720]   multi screen game that we had a little bit. That was where the
[00:53:41.720 --> 00:53:44.800]   slot car game. They lined up a variety of different screen
[00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:46.880]   sizes, one next to each other in the slot car.
[00:53:46.880 --> 00:53:50.360]   Track somehow magically went across all of the.
[00:53:50.360 --> 00:53:54.480]   Life person playing on a device with their car. So I had
[00:53:54.480 --> 00:53:55.800]   the green car. You had the red car.
[00:53:55.800 --> 00:53:57.720]   So weird, but I don't see the use for it.
[00:53:57.720 --> 00:53:58.200]   No, no.
[00:53:58.400 --> 00:54:01.280]   Yeah, that's even more like just about a demo. But the demo
[00:54:01.280 --> 00:54:05.880]   fail was the multiplayer racing game, which which popped and
[00:54:05.880 --> 00:54:09.440]   unfortunately, Google Play Services has stopped dialogue box
[00:54:09.440 --> 00:54:12.320]   the FC the dreaded FC the force close, which every Android
[00:54:12.320 --> 00:54:15.400]   developer knows and eight and the whole room just went like
[00:54:15.400 --> 00:54:20.720]   but speaking of Google Play services, did you guys catch a
[00:54:20.720 --> 00:54:23.400]   Google Play services actually going to get updated directly
[00:54:23.400 --> 00:54:26.600]   through Google? So Google Play services is is the thing that
[00:54:26.600 --> 00:54:29.120]   developers hook into to integrate Google services in their apps.
[00:54:29.120 --> 00:54:32.280]   And they made the point to say Google updates this, we push out
[00:54:32.280 --> 00:54:37.640]   directly to everyone no matter what Android version. So this is
[00:54:37.640 --> 00:54:40.320]   one way that they're targeting that they're trying to take
[00:54:40.320 --> 00:54:42.400]   care of fragmentation fragmentation issue, they're pushing
[00:54:42.400 --> 00:54:45.840]   services out and all installs versus Larry had I mean, and
[00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:50.880]   Sundar had an interview in Wired two days ago and he acknowledged
[00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:53.720]   that that that the fragmentation of Android is a problem
[00:54:53.720 --> 00:54:55.920]   they're dealing with it. So they know this is an issue. So this
[00:54:55.920 --> 00:54:58.280]   is one way they can tackle part of it. Yeah, is it the services
[00:54:58.280 --> 00:55:01.360]   layer? I like cross platform logins cross platform
[00:55:01.360 --> 00:55:05.400]   notifications or cross device cross device. So if you swipe a
[00:55:05.400 --> 00:55:08.240]   notification away on your phone, it also you don't have to
[00:55:08.240 --> 00:55:11.440]   swipe it again. That's awesome. Sync notifications. But this
[00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:13.880]   also pushes the idea that they want you to operate with multiple
[00:55:13.880 --> 00:55:16.520]   devices. Yeah, you might as well. Once again, I will come back to
[00:55:16.520 --> 00:55:19.080]   I have a Chrome device. The same notification should be there.
[00:55:19.080 --> 00:55:21.720]   Right. The same ability should be her on the Chrome Pixel as
[00:55:21.720 --> 00:55:24.280]   there are my Android devices. It's a multi screen world. This is
[00:55:24.280 --> 00:55:26.200]   one of the first things that Sundar said when he came out on
[00:55:26.200 --> 00:55:29.080]   stage, he had a Pebble watch on by the way, I noticed that
[00:55:29.080 --> 00:55:32.320]   and I thought you were going to get a watch. But no, I was a
[00:55:32.320 --> 00:55:34.960]   Pebble watch everyone on stage. I saw some people in chat.
[00:55:34.960 --> 00:55:38.400]   They all have big watches on Big Square watches. So I think I
[00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:41.320]   write I lead over Gino one point. Do you think do you think
[00:55:41.320 --> 00:55:47.640]   we'd be maybe be the one more thing? That's okay. Let's see
[00:55:47.640 --> 00:55:51.720]   what else there's so many nine million Android activations in
[00:55:51.720 --> 00:55:55.360]   2013. Is that a big number? He said there's still what is it
[00:55:55.360 --> 00:56:00.360]   six billion to go. But you have your Facebook as supposedly a
[00:56:00.360 --> 00:56:05.280]   billion nine million Android devices now that's pretty good.
[00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:07.360]   So next year is going to be the one billion. It's a billion.
[00:56:07.360 --> 00:56:11.640]   What next year to be born? 48 billion app installs 2.5 in the
[00:56:11.640 --> 00:56:15.800]   last month alone. But here's the big problem. And my son Jake
[00:56:15.800 --> 00:56:17.640]   and I were talking about this on emails as the thing was going
[00:56:17.640 --> 00:56:22.320]   on. That the number of apps is a huge problem. There's no
[00:56:22.320 --> 00:56:25.760]   discovery structure. And you're like, I go in and I don't play
[00:56:25.760 --> 00:56:29.560]   games and it's gonna be nothing but games. And that doesn't
[00:56:29.560 --> 00:56:32.080]   work very well. And the weird thing is that I think that they
[00:56:32.080 --> 00:56:36.360]   tackled the discovery issue in music before they're tackling
[00:56:36.360 --> 00:56:40.720]   it in apps. So it'll now try to be very personalized to me and
[00:56:40.720 --> 00:56:43.080]   recommend music to me and show me all kinds of ways to get to
[00:56:43.080 --> 00:56:45.760]   music and show me lots of paths to it. And they're not doing
[00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:48.880]   that in the app side, which is very strange. It would be nice
[00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:51.840]   to say it would be nice to say what what I see client or my
[00:56:51.840 --> 00:56:54.760]   friends using on exactly all the things that they're doing in
[00:56:54.760 --> 00:56:56.840]   music, they should be doing an apps. And that's where you're
[00:56:56.840 --> 00:56:59.520]   directly supporting the developers. That's where you're
[00:56:59.520 --> 00:57:02.640]   going to support the quality of the ecosystem by getting better
[00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:06.760]   apps to rise and better apps to be found. If I know you were
[00:57:06.760 --> 00:57:08.960]   operating on an app, then that would matter to me. Yeah,
[00:57:08.960 --> 00:57:12.840]   Leo on the other hand, well, I'm using this new pixel. You
[00:57:12.840 --> 00:57:16.680]   think I really like it. I know you're one of the coffee to go
[00:57:16.680 --> 00:57:21.320]   that way. I actually like it. Let's talk about since you're a
[00:57:21.320 --> 00:57:23.960]   developer. And that was one of the things they showed this I
[00:57:23.960 --> 00:57:27.960]   you know, I liked it when they geek out a new IDE. And they
[00:57:27.960 --> 00:57:30.920]   led with this right? Yeah, this is like right at the time. The
[00:57:30.920 --> 00:57:34.240]   first video was was was geeky. Yeah, yeah, the history of the
[00:57:34.240 --> 00:57:39.760]   web. Yeah, I get into that. I do love this video. So what is
[00:57:39.760 --> 00:57:42.080]   IntelliJ? Because that's what they're basing this on. Yeah,
[00:57:42.080 --> 00:57:45.160]   so I'm familiar with Eclipse, which is kind of the free easy to
[00:57:45.160 --> 00:57:48.040]   use, easy to download. Yeah, it's an integrated development
[00:57:48.040 --> 00:57:50.440]   tool. It integrated development environment, which means that
[00:57:50.440 --> 00:57:53.360]   there's built into bugging and previews and kind of wiziwig
[00:57:53.360 --> 00:57:56.040]   tools making to make it easy, not just a text editor, a way to
[00:57:56.040 --> 00:57:58.800]   write code and an environment that's smart about the code that
[00:57:58.800 --> 00:58:00.920]   you're writing. So right now, the standard for developing on
[00:58:00.920 --> 00:58:04.480]   Android is Eclipse with an Android plug in and it clips is a
[00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:08.840]   free Java based open source app. Yes, a clip right, Eclipse is
[00:58:08.840 --> 00:58:12.400]   an open source, that is a cross platform. It works very well
[00:58:12.400 --> 00:58:14.800]   for Java. I believe it was built originally for Java, but
[00:58:14.800 --> 00:58:18.280]   there are plugins as well PHP. I think it actually might be
[00:58:18.280 --> 00:58:21.720]   right. I think you're right. It was written in Java itself. And
[00:58:21.720 --> 00:58:25.040]   what's IntelliJ? Is that a commercial? It's also
[00:58:25.040 --> 00:58:29.520]   a patchy. It is also an IDE similar to Eclipse, but they
[00:58:29.520 --> 00:58:32.520]   announced today Android Studio, which will be based in
[00:58:32.520 --> 00:58:36.240]   IntelliJ, but it's a very smart kind of Android development
[00:58:36.240 --> 00:58:38.760]   environment on top of IntelliJ. So there's a moving from a
[00:58:38.760 --> 00:58:41.960]   Eclipse to IntelliJ, which is a big, big move. And I'll tell
[00:58:41.960 --> 00:58:44.480]   you, I like Eclipse. I grew up in Eclipse, but seeing some of
[00:58:44.480 --> 00:58:47.080]   what they showed today on screen with IntelliJ, I was
[00:58:47.080 --> 00:58:49.440]   really, really kind of excited. Automatically filling in the
[00:58:49.440 --> 00:58:52.480]   resources. So if you have a string, it will pull the string
[00:58:52.480 --> 00:58:54.800]   from a resource file and show you what that's going to look
[00:58:54.800 --> 00:58:57.320]   like. So when you do localization, every single string,
[00:58:57.320 --> 00:58:59.760]   you know, even like, you know, the okay, you know, okay on a
[00:58:59.760 --> 00:59:01.880]   button that's represented by a variable, right? Because you
[00:59:01.880 --> 00:59:04.040]   when you have localization, that variable could be depending
[00:59:04.040 --> 00:59:06.880]   on your language. So for example, if you reference that
[00:59:06.880 --> 00:59:09.040]   string in your code, it will show you what the string reads in
[00:59:09.040 --> 00:59:12.640]   your language. Similarly, every single drawable, every
[00:59:12.640 --> 00:59:15.400]   single image resource, for example, is also referenced through
[00:59:15.400 --> 00:59:19.880]   a variable. So in this IntelliJ set up those, those icons,
[00:59:19.880 --> 00:59:23.360]   those images show up preview in in line with your code, which
[00:59:23.360 --> 00:59:25.600]   is really, really awesome. The other thing I absolutely love,
[00:59:25.600 --> 00:59:29.000]   they had this beautiful live preview layout. So like as you
[00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:33.360]   composing your app layouts, it will show you what we have a
[00:59:33.360 --> 00:59:36.120]   six devices up there. So that the big screen, the tablet
[00:59:36.120 --> 00:59:39.200]   seven inch layout, the 10 inch layout, the phone layout, so
[00:59:39.200 --> 00:59:41.960]   that way you can see what's my layout going to look like on
[00:59:41.960 --> 00:59:44.760]   these devices. And this live update. So if I say, hey, you
[00:59:44.760 --> 00:59:48.760]   know, what make this text 26 sp, you know, they showed the
[00:59:48.760 --> 00:59:51.160]   demo, it would, it would, you know, live update as you type
[00:59:51.160 --> 00:59:54.160]   and it would, and it would kind of show how big it would look.
[00:59:54.160 --> 00:59:55.800]   And then you could see it in different languages. So all the
[00:59:55.800 --> 00:59:59.440]   German translation wraps when this text is a little larger. What
[00:59:59.440 --> 01:00:02.040]   do I want to do about that? But that's, that's extremely good.
[01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:04.080]   That this is a great development environment gives you instant
[01:00:04.080 --> 01:00:06.400]   feedback and shows you what you're doing as you do as you're
[01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:08.880]   doing it without having to compile and build and launch the
[01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:11.560]   simulator. And, and so this is what this is. I'm really excited
[01:00:11.560 --> 01:00:15.400]   about this. This is looks like available to download right now
[01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:17.120]   and it's killing me that I can't install it on this picture.
[01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:19.720]   And on the chatroom, they're minus about the alpha beta
[01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:23.120]   rollouts. Oh, yeah. So this is right. So these are, this is a
[01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:25.560]   bunch of improvements in the Android developer console, which
[01:00:25.560 --> 01:00:27.880]   is the web based console like that you upload your your
[01:00:27.880 --> 01:00:31.840]   Android apps to. There's several several things here, beta
[01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:34.800]   testing and stage rollouts. So far, so I build an Android app, I
[01:00:34.800 --> 01:00:37.440]   can say, okay, I want to, I want to release a beta to a limited
[01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:39.720]   number of users and consumers. I can do that now.
[01:00:39.720 --> 01:00:41.720]   Which is out of either Google groups or Google plus circles.
[01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:44.000]   Google groups or Google plus circles. This is very similar to
[01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.720]   what test flight does. I've used test flight to do this. Talk
[01:00:46.720 --> 01:00:50.120]   about getting Sherlocked. A couple, a few other few other
[01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:53.720]   things, things like revenue graphs, you can see right now,
[01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:56.240]   it's ridiculously difficult to see like how much money did my
[01:00:56.240 --> 01:00:59.320]   app make on what day and what's my total. So showing better,
[01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:01.960]   much better revenue statistics. I actually use an app called
[01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:04.620]   app Annie to do that now. So app Annie also kind of got
[01:01:04.620 --> 01:01:08.600]   your heart today is not cheap. It's 699 for commercial license.
[01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:13.120]   It's a 499 for standalone license. It's $199 for personal
[01:01:13.120 --> 01:01:16.560]   license. Are they going to give this away? It's open source
[01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:18.960]   project license. Oh, that's interesting. So they've got to
[01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:20.960]   be giving away for they're not going to make developers.
[01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:23.760]   There's a free community there is a free community version.
[01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:26.040]   Yeah, you can download you can download the area of courses.
[01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:28.880]   You can't use it on the pixel. Right. Well, that's what I'm
[01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:32.800]   saying. I would love to install it here. So it's available for
[01:01:32.800 --> 01:01:35.960]   Mac windows and Linux. I could install Linux here and run it.
[01:01:35.960 --> 01:01:38.280]   I could see doing the app development cloud. Could you?
[01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:43.840]   No, as much as you could video as much video. You know, with
[01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:47.360]   with Android development, it's Java. So you want to have an ID
[01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:50.120]   that's aware of the classes and the functions that are available
[01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:52.640]   and that can do debugging with Java, you compile to bytecode and
[01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:56.720]   then run like it's it's a it's not I got all that I got all
[01:01:56.720 --> 01:01:59.160]   that I just did every every syllable. I'm not saying that it's
[01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:02.520]   not possible. It would be a little complicated. Last thing,
[01:02:02.520 --> 01:02:05.240]   app translation service built right into the developer console.
[01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:07.840]   So the developer console will say, Hey, you know, you've got a
[01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:10.640]   bunch of Russian users. You got a bunch of users in Spain. But
[01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:13.200]   you you're not translate your app isn't translated to to this
[01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:15.680]   language. Do you want to buy a translation? How much was it?
[01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:19.240]   It's marketplace marketplace so that you can you can find
[01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:21.440]   multiple translators see how they're rated. They're human
[01:02:21.440 --> 01:02:24.320]   with a charters computer humans. And you want humans. But
[01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:28.240]   remember how proud Facebook was rightfully so of putting in
[01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:30.480]   the tools that enable the community themselves to translate
[01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:33.960]   Facebook. And now that structure is being extended to be able to
[01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:36.760]   translate anything. And also very important one one map they
[01:02:36.760 --> 01:02:40.040]   showed at the beginning of the screen was in green around the
[01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:42.960]   world, all the countries where Android was less than 10%
[01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:47.960]   Yes, penetration. And it says large, large chunks of the world.
[01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:50.640]   It's a part of Google's bigger master plan is to take over the
[01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:53.960]   world. And this kind of translation. And in a world where
[01:02:53.960 --> 01:02:56.400]   we care about diversity within a country or worldwide
[01:02:56.400 --> 01:02:59.560]   diversity, to be able to get more people and more languages,
[01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:02.960]   doing things together online is a good thing. This is the map
[01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:07.960]   that Vic showed of the green is places where Android is less
[01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:11.400]   than 10% penetration. So these are markets like Greenland,
[01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:14.680]   they're gonna get Greenland. That give away 10 phones. They
[01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:17.640]   got it that Google really could get into and could really help
[01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:21.600]   them notice Chile is the one country in South America that is
[01:03:21.600 --> 01:03:24.840]   a big end. Where's the Metamol that I assume? In Central
[01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:27.840]   America there? Yeah, I guess it's Panama, sure, Australia. But
[01:03:27.840 --> 01:03:31.520]   but most of South America, most of Central America, all of
[01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:35.280]   Africa, and much of Asia, including China, of course, and
[01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:39.600]   India. So some big markets out there. And translations of paint
[01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:41.880]   at the pain in the rear, I have a service right now called crowd
[01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:44.280]   in where people can submit translations and other translators
[01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:47.520]   can approve and or offer suggestions. And it's it's not
[01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:49.960]   easy. So this this makes it sound
[01:03:50.520 --> 01:03:54.280]   it's a cost, but marketplace and that's gonna limit the cost and
[01:03:54.280 --> 01:03:58.280]   get more and more. So what's unclear about this Android
[01:03:58.280 --> 01:04:01.800]   studios is an Aaron Nukem was talking about this in our
[01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:07.600]   coverage of the keynote. Is it a fork of IntelliJ? Is it are
[01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:10.760]   they can contribute back to IntelliJ? What is the relationship
[01:04:10.760 --> 01:04:16.400]   to the IntelliJ ID? I got the I thought that it's a layer on
[01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:20.400]   top. So with the with the client, ADT, right, plug in this is
[01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:22.200]   the Android studios, a new Android development environment
[01:04:22.200 --> 01:04:25.240]   based on IntelliJ. They're working with JetBrains,
[01:04:25.240 --> 01:04:28.400]   apparently, according to JBR and a chat room. Okay, actually, in
[01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:33.840]   the JetBrains blog, they say they talk a little bit about it. So
[01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:38.240]   it's a fork. It is free. It's not a fork.
[01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:40.080]   It's a
[01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:43.480]   chat room. So I just take that with a
[01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:43.960]   fork that
[01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:44.600]   makes it sad.
[01:04:44.600 --> 01:04:45.680]   Salt on your fork.
[01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:50.600]   It's it's not clear from the documentation here.
[01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:56.360]   Okay, so but I think an important move because the
[01:04:56.360 --> 01:04:58.240]   development tools have to look polished and you're competing
[01:04:58.240 --> 01:05:01.080]   against iOS where they have very polished free
[01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:04.560]   development tools. X code is very, very nice. It is.
[01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:07.560]   Let's see what else here. Oh, I guess we should talk about
[01:05:07.560 --> 01:05:09.960]   music. Let's take a break. And when we do, we'll come back and
[01:05:09.960 --> 01:05:13.680]   talk about the music and the Google phone, the pure
[01:05:13.680 --> 01:05:17.360]   experience that awaits you. Not what you thought it would be.
[01:05:17.480 --> 01:05:19.280]   God, there were rumors like there was going to be this
[01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:21.360]   flexible display and
[01:05:21.360 --> 01:05:26.640]   rumor mill went crazy, crazy on this one. And it's nothing
[01:05:26.640 --> 01:05:29.120]   like that. Our show today brought to you by
[01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:32.080]   legal zoom.com. If you've been waiting for the perfect time
[01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:34.600]   to start your business, you couldn't find a better time
[01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:37.440]   than right now, right? But can I point out there are a few
[01:05:37.440 --> 01:05:41.200]   steps you ought to take even I, in my infinite ignorance,
[01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:44.760]   formed an LLC when I started to it and trademarked. Thank
[01:05:44.760 --> 01:05:48.440]   goodness, the name and the logo. And I did all that for very
[01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:53.320]   little money, not with a law firm, but with legal zoom.com $99
[01:05:53.320 --> 01:05:57.840]   to incorporate your business or form an LLC just 99 bucks. And
[01:05:57.840 --> 01:06:00.080]   it's a simple process. You walk through a questionnaire on the
[01:06:00.080 --> 01:06:03.520]   website, you, you've got to do it to protect yourself to protect
[01:06:03.520 --> 01:06:07.720]   yourself legally. But you don't have to spend a lot of money on a
[01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:12.120]   white shoe attorney. That's still a phrase people use. No, just
[01:06:12.120 --> 01:06:13.720]   pretend I didn't say that. Okay, gramps.
[01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:18.800]   Hey, he's playing golf all the time. I can't get a hold of
[01:06:18.800 --> 01:06:23.080]   him. You was the last time you saw white shoes. No, you're
[01:06:23.080 --> 01:06:25.240]   right. People don't wear my mother tried to make it where
[01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:28.560]   them she insisted that you had to wear the blazer in the summer,
[01:06:28.560 --> 01:06:31.680]   you had to wear white shoes after Memorial Day before Labor Day,
[01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:35.000]   but never. And I never I would allow them on me. Yeah.
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:38.520]   But white belt to go with it and maybe she won that she wanted
[01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:42.400]   that. Wouldn't do it. Look good. You'd be sharp looking. Let's
[01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:45.560]   bring it back. I wanted to wear a neighborhood jacket instead.
[01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:50.920]   Yeah, you were a hipster and an ascot. Not that there's anything
[01:06:50.920 --> 01:06:52.760]   wrong with that. Not that there's anything wrong with that.
[01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:55.880]   And live back to legal zoom. But do you have a will? You better

[01:07:51.560 --> 01:07:56.360]   them know you heard about it here legal zoom.com. That was the
[01:07:56.360 --> 01:08:01.280]   one rumor that we that came true was the Spotify like Google
[01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:04.960]   music service. We had heard that they'd made deals with two.
[01:08:05.160 --> 01:08:10.760]   Who is that? Just why shoes on a on a Google search for hipsters.
[01:08:10.760 --> 01:08:13.440]   Those are sneakers. So what here what you got to search for is
[01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:17.000]   white leather shoes, white leather shoes, not sneakers. OK,
[01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:21.480]   not sneakers. We're talking patent leather. Yeah. Shiny white
[01:08:21.480 --> 01:08:25.600]   shoes, white bucks. Search for white B UCS. I don't know if I
[01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:28.400]   have to be you may not want to search for that. I don't know.
[01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:32.440]   Well, don't show the screen until you know. Right. No, no,
[01:08:32.440 --> 01:08:37.440]   no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:08:37.440 --> 01:08:41.200]   I used to work with a saloon's grand daughter. There they are.
[01:08:41.200 --> 01:08:44.840]   Really? Yeah. There you go. Yep. Yep. You made those white
[01:08:44.840 --> 01:09:01.760]   bucks famous. They're like hush puppies. Only white. So we're goin' to do it this week and yesterday year. Yeah. I remember when you had a dial a telephone. What did that mean, grandpa? What did that do? It's only a matter of time from too old. The white bucks are a tight chart. I have to say.
[01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:20.720]   So I hear you kids have something newer than the Victroma. What are you listening to music on now, Gina? It's called Google Play Music All Access. So did they do deals with all the record companies? They had three. They had the big guys plus independence. All right.
[01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:26.640]   A uniquely Google approach. So one advantage they have is that many of us have already
[01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:36.640]   uploaded all of our music to Google or done the music recognition thing. I've got 24,000 tracks. Yeah, me too. I just like just sent the whole library up there. And it's great because I could stream it.
[01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:50.640]   So that is going to supplement. Because he kept saying millions. Now, most of these services now are talking about about 8 million tracks, something like that. Spotify and Mogg and RDO and Rhapsody. They all have about 8 million tracks.
[01:09:50.640 --> 01:09:59.640]   So I don't know if they've got them all or not, but because you have your own music. If you're own music and then you can listen to stream music, it blends your own life.
[01:09:59.640 --> 01:10:07.640]   Plus, it's also as a social end as well, obviously. And this is a couple of times they've said this a recommendation engine. They really talked about recommendation.
[01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:17.640]   Recommendation is something hard to do. It's never really worked right. Netflix hasn't got it right, even though they've had the Netflix prize for a while and really had some smart people working on this Amazon's recommendations are terrible.
[01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:24.640]   They recommend stuff you already bought. So it has Google licked this because if somebody can figure out recommendations, that's huge.
[01:10:24.640 --> 01:10:34.640]   I mean, this sounds like Pandora, right? I mean, the Google's approach, right? Like, "Hey, I want to listen to the song. I really like this song right now." And then Google music apparently. I haven't tried this yet. Assembles a playlist.
[01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:38.640]   And then you can kind of flip through the playlist. You can say, "Yeah, I don't want this. And swipe it away."
[01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:50.640]   When I used to go to the record store, there was a nice young guy. You'd tell him, "Hey, I really like that T-Rex band." You got anything else like that? And he'd say, "Oh, you love T-Rex."
[01:10:50.640 --> 01:10:55.640]   You know, you'll love it. Because he only had 10 albums out of weeks, so it wasn't hard to keep track of them.
[01:10:55.640 --> 01:11:01.640]   And it worked, by the way. Humans work. One thing Pandora does is they have a music genome project.
[01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:08.640]   This is really important. Well, no, that turns out from what I understand. That's bogus. That's bogus. They don't really do that. That's Tim Westgren's just...
[01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:16.640]   They tried to make it work. It didn't work. Here's the first business. Here's a really fascinating thing in the music announcement. Big deal. They have human curators.
[01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:23.640]   See, that's the way to do it. That's really important. That's not really important. No, it's not because they don't do that in news. They don't do the content.
[01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:28.640]   So they have people who are going to curate music collections.
[01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:33.640]   We see that kind of thing. Apple does that. They'll have like JZ Do My Playlist and stuff like that.
[01:11:33.640 --> 01:11:37.640]   Right, right. It's a celebrity curator. Yeah. There are basically Harry music editors.
[01:11:37.640 --> 01:11:43.640]   That's my impression. I think it's... Unfortunately, this is a hard thing to do computationally. So maybe that's them saying...
[01:11:43.640 --> 01:11:48.640]   But again, I wish that... Well, I mean, if there's anybody who can handle a problem that's hard to do computationally, I think it's Google, right?
[01:11:48.640 --> 01:11:51.640]   Right. So... That's why it's surprising to hear there's humans involved in all.
[01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:54.640]   Yeah, I know. I thought it was all... Again, I would wish they put the same effort they put into music.
[01:11:54.640 --> 01:11:58.640]   Now put it toward news, put it toward apps, put it toward other areas.
[01:11:58.640 --> 01:12:03.640]   So it's available now. You can do it on the web. Music.com.
[01:12:03.640 --> 01:12:07.640]   It's available now in the US launching today.
[01:12:07.640 --> 01:12:12.640]   When I launched the Google Music app, it had automatically updated.
[01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:16.640]   It did with the last... And it said, "If you want to try it free for 30 days, do."
[01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:23.640]   It did take my credit card number. It said, "As long as you try it free within before June, you'll get $7.99 a month."
[01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:27.640]   And this is a Google Wallet purchase. It didn't actually end.
[01:12:27.640 --> 01:12:31.640]   It's a wallet purchase. So I'd actually press purchase.
[01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:33.640]   Even though it won't charge me for a while.
[01:12:33.640 --> 01:12:35.640]   Even with the trial.
[01:12:35.640 --> 01:12:41.640]   And in this case, Google sounded to be like two things. One is that it was playing up to Hollywood and the industry.
[01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:43.640]   And second is they sounded like a cable company.
[01:12:43.640 --> 01:12:48.640]   The $7.99 for now, and they don't tell you how long before it's going to go out to $10.
[01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:50.640]   Yeah, before June 30th.
[01:12:50.640 --> 01:12:53.640]   I don't really want to find myself going out to the world.
[01:12:53.640 --> 01:12:55.640]   You lie down with dogs, you're going to get up with fleas.
[01:12:55.640 --> 01:12:58.640]   And I think that's the problem is they're now in coffee.
[01:12:58.640 --> 01:13:00.640]   Well, I'm not... Yeah.
[01:13:00.640 --> 01:13:04.640]   I mean, you get in bed with the music industry, suddenly, the things that happen.
[01:13:04.640 --> 01:13:07.640]   So the companies where Google does not have the ability to be independent,
[01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:10.640]   right now we've seen two industries where this has happened.
[01:13:10.640 --> 01:13:12.640]   One is telcos, two is music.
[01:13:12.640 --> 01:13:15.640]   Three is video.
[01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:17.640]   Yeah, YouTube.
[01:13:17.640 --> 01:13:18.640]   Yeah.
[01:13:18.640 --> 01:13:20.640]   That happens. Google, it's squirrely.
[01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:21.640]   Leo's running out of batteries.
[01:13:21.640 --> 01:13:24.640]   He's trying to find a battery in here somewhere.
[01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:26.640]   I don't know where he's at.
[01:13:26.640 --> 01:13:28.640]   I put it in here somewhere.
[01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:30.640]   Battery.
[01:13:30.640 --> 01:13:35.640]   So the new phone, there's no Motorola phone.
[01:13:35.640 --> 01:13:36.640]   We thought there might be.
[01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:37.640]   Yeah, no, no X-4.
[01:13:37.640 --> 01:13:38.640]   There's no X.
[01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:39.640]   No, next I, no, no.
[01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:41.640]   The new phone from Google.
[01:13:41.640 --> 01:13:42.640]   Thank you, sir.
[01:13:42.640 --> 01:13:44.640]   Is get ready for this.
[01:13:44.640 --> 01:13:46.640]   The Galaxy S4.
[01:13:46.640 --> 01:13:47.640]   Samsung Galaxy S4.
[01:13:47.640 --> 01:13:50.640]   But there's something a little bit different about it.
[01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:51.640]   It's pure.
[01:13:51.640 --> 01:13:52.640]   No more touch whiz.
[01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:54.640]   Yeah, they said, "Check out the home screen."
[01:13:54.640 --> 01:13:55.640]   And it looked like it's standard.
[01:13:55.640 --> 01:13:56.640]   Yeah, he was showing his Galaxy S4.
[01:13:56.640 --> 01:13:59.640]   And everyone in there was just like growing like the audience.
[01:13:59.640 --> 01:14:02.640]   Because there was a rumor they were going to do this.
[01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:04.640]   And I think this is great.
[01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:06.640]   $649 is a little pricey.
[01:14:06.640 --> 01:14:08.640]   It's the 16 gigabyte version.
[01:14:08.640 --> 01:14:12.640]   Although I paid for the unlocked 16 gigabyte version, I paid $800.
[01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:14.640]   And this is the LTE, right?
[01:14:14.640 --> 01:14:15.640]   No LTE.
[01:14:15.640 --> 01:14:16.640]   No LTE.
[01:14:16.640 --> 01:14:17.640]   This one does not do LTE.
[01:14:17.640 --> 01:14:18.640]   No plug.
[01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:20.640]   This is a T-Mobile AT&T.
[01:14:20.640 --> 01:14:21.640]   Is it LTE?
[01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:22.640]   Yeah, it is.
[01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:23.640]   It's LTE.
[01:14:23.640 --> 01:14:24.640]   Chad wrote LTE.
[01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:25.640]   But I don't know.
[01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:26.640]   Are you right, Chad?
[01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:27.640]   Yeah, I wrote that down to bootloader unlocked.
[01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:30.640]   It's the Nexus user experience on sale June 26.
[01:14:30.640 --> 01:14:32.640]   LTE on AT&T.
[01:14:32.640 --> 01:14:36.640]   T-Mobile LTE is kind of nonexistent, but I guess you'd get it.
[01:14:36.640 --> 01:14:38.640]   It says in this slide LTE.
[01:14:38.640 --> 01:14:39.640]   LTE.
[01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:41.640]   Well, that's different than what I got.
[01:14:41.640 --> 01:14:42.640]   And that is good.
[01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:46.640]   I think the Nexus user experience on a premium phone.
[01:14:46.640 --> 01:14:48.640]   So should I replace my--
[01:14:48.640 --> 01:14:49.640]   I think you'd like it.
[01:14:49.640 --> 01:14:50.640]   Should Gina replace her gallon?
[01:14:50.640 --> 01:14:51.640]   I think you would want to.
[01:14:51.640 --> 01:14:55.640]   Because this is more cores.
[01:14:55.640 --> 01:14:57.640]   It's a nice phone.
[01:14:57.640 --> 01:14:58.640]   Great screen, 1920 by 1080.
[01:14:58.640 --> 01:15:01.640]   Now that I can plug it in, I can show you.
[01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:03.640]   Yeah, you can hold it.
[01:15:03.640 --> 01:15:04.640]   Yeah, you can hold it.
[01:15:04.640 --> 01:15:06.640]   Yeah, you can hold it on my phone, lady.
[01:15:06.640 --> 01:15:08.640]   Yeah, it's a bigger screen.
[01:15:08.640 --> 01:15:11.640]   As soon as it boots up, I had to restart it because I took the battery out.
[01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:13.640]   Yeah, I digged a little window, I got to say.
[01:15:13.640 --> 01:15:15.640]   That's not part of the deal.
[01:15:15.640 --> 01:15:16.640]   You have to buy that separately.
[01:15:16.640 --> 01:15:17.640]   That's different.
[01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:26.640]   They charge you through the nose for that Samsung sells the windowed flip case for, I think, 50 or 60 bucks, which is ridiculous.
[01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:27.640]   It's a piece of plastic.
[01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:33.640]   Thicker, heavier, battery life, probably comparable, not because, of course, you've got a much higher-res screen.
[01:15:33.640 --> 01:15:38.640]   Yeah, you can't pull the battery out of your Nexus, which, and you don't have LTE.
[01:15:38.640 --> 01:15:40.640]   So probably it is a good upgrade for you.
[01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:41.640]   You're running yours on T-Mobile?
[01:15:41.640 --> 01:15:42.640]   AT&T.
[01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:43.640]   AT&T?
[01:15:43.640 --> 01:15:46.640]   Well, then definitely is a good upgrade because you'd get LTE.
[01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:50.640]   And I bought a Note 2 on eBay that I'll sell and that'll pay for most of it.
[01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:52.640]   Well, in the Note 3 is coming out and so forth.
[01:15:52.640 --> 01:15:54.640]   But I think the screen is gorgeous.
[01:15:54.640 --> 01:15:57.640]   Let me launch Google+ for you.
[01:15:57.640 --> 01:15:59.640]   It's a heck of a nice phone, I think.
[01:15:59.640 --> 01:16:03.640]   Are there any of the Samsung apps that you would wish if you had pure?
[01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:06.640]   No, there's not a Samsung app that I missed.
[01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:09.640]   I have to say, some of the Samsung customizations I like, there are some interesting things that
[01:16:09.640 --> 01:16:11.640]   are more interesting things in the phone.
[01:16:11.640 --> 01:16:14.640]   I mean, the camera, there's some interesting settings, capabilities.
[01:16:14.640 --> 01:16:15.640]   There's one feature.
[01:16:15.640 --> 01:16:17.640]   It would be my pick if we were going to do picks this week.
[01:16:17.640 --> 01:16:20.640]   It has a sound adapt feature where you go.
[01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:22.640]   It actually does a hearing test on you.
[01:16:22.640 --> 01:16:23.640]   You put your headphones in.
[01:16:23.640 --> 01:16:24.640]   I know, that's crazy.
[01:16:24.640 --> 01:16:27.640]   You put your headphones in, you plug it in, it says, "Can you hear this?"
[01:16:27.640 --> 01:16:28.640]   and it doesn't need you here.
[01:16:28.640 --> 01:16:29.640]   "Can you hear this?
[01:16:29.640 --> 01:16:30.640]   Can you hear this?"
[01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:31.640]   and you press yes or no.
[01:16:31.640 --> 01:16:33.640]   And then it makes a curve based on what you were able to hear.
[01:16:33.640 --> 01:16:34.640]   It says, "You are 49 years old."
[01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:36.640]   Yeah, it could tell how old, exactly how old you are.
[01:16:36.640 --> 01:16:41.640]   And then it says, "Would you like me to apply the adjustment to your calls, to your music,
[01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:42.640]   to everything?"
[01:16:42.640 --> 01:16:44.640]   And I got to tell you, it sounds a lot better to my old ears.
[01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:47.640]   Fixes the loss of high-end because I'm older.
[01:16:47.640 --> 01:16:49.640]   Boost the base a little bit.
[01:16:49.640 --> 01:16:51.640]   I'll show you my curve if you want to see it.
[01:16:51.640 --> 01:16:53.640]   So that's something Samsung added.
[01:16:53.640 --> 01:16:55.640]   It's fixed rain, a lot of widgets.
[01:16:55.640 --> 01:16:57.640]   Oh, it's crazy with it.
[01:16:57.640 --> 01:16:58.640]   There's so much stuff on this phone.
[01:16:58.640 --> 01:16:59.640]   It's ridiculous.
[01:16:59.640 --> 01:17:04.640]   I didn't even know about this because for the longest time, I didn't dig deep enough into the menu.
[01:17:04.640 --> 01:17:10.640]   But if I scroll down into adapt sound, you can see how different my curve is from the optimal curve.
[01:17:10.640 --> 01:17:11.640]   I guess we don't have that shot.
[01:17:11.640 --> 01:17:12.640]   How many years?
[01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:13.640]   Yeah, we do.
[01:17:13.640 --> 01:17:14.640]   So the headphones on.
[01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:17.640]   Yeah, you can see it rolls off the high-end, rolls off the...
[01:17:17.640 --> 01:17:20.640]   Basically, I only hear things in the middle frequency there.
[01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:23.640]   But they say, "After adaptation, that's what it's going to sound like.
[01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:24.640]   It's going to be flat."
[01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:25.640]   Wow.
[01:17:25.640 --> 01:17:27.640]   And they also ask what your dominant ear is.
[01:17:27.640 --> 01:17:30.640]   So this is a Samsung feature that probably Google won't add.
[01:17:30.640 --> 01:17:33.640]   This is very hard, we're dependent probably, right?
[01:17:33.640 --> 01:17:36.640]   Well, no, but you're getting the hardware.
[01:17:36.640 --> 01:17:37.640]   It's not hard, it's just touch-wiz.
[01:17:37.640 --> 01:17:39.640]   Obviously, Google's not going to add it to...
[01:17:39.640 --> 01:17:42.640]   They could...well, it's the same hardware, I guess they could.
[01:17:42.640 --> 01:17:45.640]   They're not going to add it because it's not the nexus experience.
[01:17:45.640 --> 01:17:46.640]   Yes.
[01:17:46.640 --> 01:17:54.640]   Although, I have to say that they did put some of the camera features that you're seeing in the late model phones in the new photo features, things like...
[01:17:54.640 --> 01:18:00.640]   In fact, they want you to share your photo sphere stuff with Google Maps.
[01:18:00.640 --> 01:18:04.640]   The picture of melding the pictures around smiling, right?
[01:18:04.640 --> 01:18:07.640]   Yeah, that's a feature that both Android and...
[01:18:07.640 --> 01:18:11.640]   I mean, the Galaxy S4 and the HTC One have is the best picture feature.
[01:18:11.640 --> 01:18:12.640]   Yeah, that was a moment where it felt like...
[01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:14.640]   I think stock Android is not going to be the same.
[01:18:14.640 --> 01:18:15.640]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:18:15.640 --> 01:18:18.640]   There was a moment there where we were like, "Oh, is this feels a little bit like the Samsung?"
[01:18:18.640 --> 01:18:19.640]   Yeah, very much so.
[01:18:19.640 --> 01:18:21.640]   Lots of photo enhancements, camera enhancements.
[01:18:21.640 --> 01:18:22.640]   All right, let's talk about maps.
[01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:24.640]   Yeah, let's cover maps.
[01:18:24.640 --> 01:18:27.640]   That's how they ended it, and I thought a good way to end it.
[01:18:27.640 --> 01:18:32.640]   The new Google Maps in the browser look different as well as on the phone, right?
[01:18:32.640 --> 01:18:38.640]   The phone is really going to enhance the mobile experience, so you'll be able to get reviews of the restaurants.
[01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:41.640]   You'll be able to create your own custom maps, I guess.
[01:18:41.640 --> 01:18:42.640]   I'm not sure.
[01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:44.640]   What, how is the mobile different?
[01:18:44.640 --> 01:18:45.640]   Are you launching it now?
[01:18:45.640 --> 01:18:46.640]   Is it down?
[01:18:46.640 --> 01:18:47.640]   I haven't upgraded it.
[01:18:47.640 --> 01:18:50.640]   Here's the new desktop version of Google Maps.
[01:18:50.640 --> 01:18:51.640]   And the desktop, there's no menus on the side.
[01:18:51.640 --> 01:18:52.640]   All the information is on the maps.
[01:18:52.640 --> 01:18:53.640]   Very, very clean.
[01:18:53.640 --> 01:18:54.640]   It's also going to be awful, but it's not.
[01:18:54.640 --> 01:19:00.640]   If you search for Starbucks layout, you'll find, well, now you've got to go through this again, but you'll find that...
[01:19:00.640 --> 01:19:01.640]   This is the little tour.
[01:19:01.640 --> 01:19:03.640]   This is going to be a long tour.
[01:19:03.640 --> 01:19:04.640]   And I couldn't click on it.
[01:19:04.640 --> 01:19:06.640]   Try searching for Sushi Boston.
[01:19:06.640 --> 01:19:07.640]   I don't want to.
[01:19:07.640 --> 01:19:08.640]   I don't really...
[01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:09.640]   Can I...
[01:19:09.640 --> 01:19:10.640]   It's like VX.
[01:19:10.640 --> 01:19:11.640]   Let's get out of that.
[01:19:11.640 --> 01:19:12.640]   I'll search for Starbucks.
[01:19:12.640 --> 01:19:14.640]   So this is the search box here.
[01:19:14.640 --> 01:19:15.640]   Or something better.
[01:19:15.640 --> 01:19:16.640]   Or Italian restaurants maybe.
[01:19:16.640 --> 01:19:17.640]   Italian.
[01:19:17.640 --> 01:19:18.640]   Okay.
[01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:20.640]   Actually, there's a really cool feature.
[01:19:20.640 --> 01:19:22.640]   And I'm surprised that they didn't use the voice.
[01:19:22.640 --> 01:19:25.640]   It won't matter because you're talking to Google.
[01:19:25.640 --> 01:19:26.640]   I know.
[01:19:26.640 --> 01:19:30.640]   Google's great for people like me and what's his name?
[01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:31.640]   Did you mean Italian restaurants?
[01:19:31.640 --> 01:19:32.640]   Yes, I did.
[01:19:32.640 --> 01:19:33.640]   So now it's filling in here.
[01:19:33.640 --> 01:19:36.640]   Places from top reviewers or your circles.
[01:19:36.640 --> 01:19:37.640]   Oh, what should I do?
[01:19:37.640 --> 01:19:39.640]   My top reviewers are my circles.
[01:19:39.640 --> 01:19:42.640]   I bet you because I live in Petaluma, nobody in my circles is...
[01:19:42.640 --> 01:19:43.640]   Yeah, it's going to back away.
[01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:44.640]   It's like, oh, we got to go.
[01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:46.640]   Yeah, well, maybe there's somewhere down there.
[01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:47.640]   And...
[01:19:47.640 --> 01:19:48.640]   Can you see BC?
[01:19:48.640 --> 01:19:50.640]   Yeah, actually we like BC.
[01:19:50.640 --> 01:19:51.640]   There you go.
[01:19:51.640 --> 01:19:53.640]   And then I could say top reviewers.
[01:19:53.640 --> 01:19:55.640]   Let's search in there.
[01:19:55.640 --> 01:19:57.640]   So this is nice.
[01:19:57.640 --> 01:19:59.640]   And they said we're going to a five-star scale.
[01:19:59.640 --> 01:20:02.640]   Does that mean they're eliminating the Zagit 30-point scale?
[01:20:02.640 --> 01:20:03.640]   I wasn't clear about that.
[01:20:03.640 --> 01:20:05.640]   Zagit, of course, a purchase.
[01:20:05.640 --> 01:20:07.640]   And you can...
[01:20:07.640 --> 01:20:10.640]   In some of these cases, I can just zoom right in.
[01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:12.640]   In fact, there's the street view.
[01:20:12.640 --> 01:20:17.640]   And then if the place has to go look for Twig, because it's going to go right inside.
[01:20:17.640 --> 01:20:18.640]   Will it?
[01:20:18.640 --> 01:20:19.640]   That's what they said.
[01:20:19.640 --> 01:20:23.640]   I should look for new media broadcast entities.
[01:20:23.640 --> 01:20:24.640]   What should I...
[01:20:24.640 --> 01:20:31.640]   Maybe just search for Twig, it won't make it easy.
[01:20:31.640 --> 01:20:32.640]   How does this pixel work?
[01:20:32.640 --> 01:20:34.640]   The same way any computer does.
[01:20:34.640 --> 01:20:35.640]   How do you work?
[01:20:35.640 --> 01:20:37.640]   Well, apparently.
[01:20:37.640 --> 01:20:41.640]   WIT is right here.
[01:20:41.640 --> 01:20:44.640]   What if there were Italian twits?
[01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:45.640]   Okay.
[01:20:45.640 --> 01:20:46.640]   Now there it is.
[01:20:46.640 --> 01:20:47.640]   Now there's the street view.
[01:20:47.640 --> 01:20:50.640]   No, I think ten pictures.
[01:20:50.640 --> 01:20:51.640]   Like street view right there.
[01:20:51.640 --> 01:20:52.640]   See inside?
[01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:54.640]   And then we just go...
[01:20:54.640 --> 01:20:55.640]   There you are.
[01:20:55.640 --> 01:20:56.640]   Isn't that?
[01:20:56.640 --> 01:20:58.640]   And it's really a pretty display now.
[01:20:58.640 --> 01:21:01.640]   I mean, it's really a gorgeous display.
[01:21:01.640 --> 01:21:04.640]   I think they've done a very nice job here.
[01:21:04.640 --> 01:21:09.640]   There are a couple of API upgrades as well to maps.
[01:21:09.640 --> 01:21:11.640]   Virtual fences around locations.
[01:21:11.640 --> 01:21:12.640]   Geofencing.
[01:21:12.640 --> 01:21:17.640]   I think it's so important for being able to use local news events at stadiums.
[01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:21.640]   And walking into a store so they know your mall.
[01:21:21.640 --> 01:21:23.640]   Yeah, here at the grocery store, get some milk.
[01:21:23.640 --> 01:21:24.640]   Activity recognition.
[01:21:24.640 --> 01:21:28.640]   So the API can tell you whether or not you're walking, biking, or driving.
[01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:33.640]   Which is awesome for something like glass, for example, which should basically silence everything except now, while you're driving.
[01:21:33.640 --> 01:21:34.640]   For example.
[01:21:34.640 --> 01:21:37.640]   And yeah, what else?
[01:21:37.640 --> 01:21:42.640]   Oh, and they just said this Fuse Location Provider, apparently getting location for apps is faster and more accurate.
[01:21:42.640 --> 01:21:44.640]   And he uses less of use.
[01:21:44.640 --> 01:21:45.640]   What is Fuse?
[01:21:45.640 --> 01:21:46.640]   Is that a company?
[01:21:46.640 --> 01:21:47.640]   Fuse...
[01:21:47.640 --> 01:21:48.640]   That's a good one.
[01:21:48.640 --> 01:21:50.640]   Fuse is multiple location providers into one.
[01:21:50.640 --> 01:21:51.640]   Yeah, it's a one.
[01:21:51.640 --> 01:21:52.640]   And so it gets you into a few locations.
[01:21:52.640 --> 01:21:53.640]   Offers?
[01:21:53.640 --> 01:21:54.640]   In mobile, you've got offers.
[01:21:54.640 --> 01:21:56.640]   What I really liked is the transit.
[01:21:56.640 --> 01:22:00.640]   Now, there is apparently there's a standard for transit information.
[01:22:00.640 --> 01:22:05.640]   But some cities are blocking this now because they want to run their own transit app.
[01:22:05.640 --> 01:22:08.640]   They want you to buy the Philadelphia Transit app for whatever it is.
[01:22:08.640 --> 01:22:09.640]   That's terrible.
[01:22:09.640 --> 01:22:10.640]   That shouldn't be.
[01:22:10.640 --> 01:22:11.640]   That should be against that.
[01:22:11.640 --> 01:22:12.640]   That is our information.
[01:22:12.640 --> 01:22:13.640]   This is monthly data.
[01:22:13.640 --> 01:22:17.640]   It should get code for America on that case.
[01:22:17.640 --> 01:22:18.640]   Any case.
[01:22:18.640 --> 01:22:24.640]   And I have to say what Google is doing with transit information, showing you the buses, showing you the timeline.
[01:22:24.640 --> 01:22:25.640]   All this is fantastic.
[01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:27.640]   It shows you the route versus driving.
[01:22:27.640 --> 01:22:31.640]   The time is going to be, and then it also shows you for a different, for a given route.
[01:22:31.640 --> 01:22:34.640]   The whole schedule, like some of the airline stuff is now.
[01:22:34.640 --> 01:22:35.640]   You want to go to blank.
[01:22:35.640 --> 01:22:36.640]   That's fabulous.
[01:22:36.640 --> 01:22:38.640]   It's really quite nice.
[01:22:38.640 --> 01:22:40.640]   There are architecting slowly.
[01:22:40.640 --> 01:22:44.640]   You kind of feel the pieces all kind of fitting in together.
[01:22:44.640 --> 01:22:47.640]   They're getting information now from your photos, putting them in maps.
[01:22:47.640 --> 01:22:51.640]   They're getting social signals, putting them in recommendations.
[01:22:51.640 --> 01:22:55.640]   You can start to see the painting kind of fill in.
[01:22:55.640 --> 01:22:57.640]   They also, the new Google Maps.
[01:22:57.640 --> 01:22:58.640]   Just zoom out.
[01:22:58.640 --> 01:23:01.640]   Take that a little bit now and zoom out all the way.
[01:23:01.640 --> 01:23:02.640]   Because that's what I'm going to see.
[01:23:02.640 --> 01:23:03.640]   Let's see the Earth.
[01:23:03.640 --> 01:23:04.640]   The Earth.
[01:23:04.640 --> 01:23:05.640]   All right.
[01:23:05.640 --> 01:23:06.640]   Let's.
[01:23:06.640 --> 01:23:07.640]   Oh.
[01:23:07.640 --> 01:23:09.640]   It says thank you.
[01:23:09.640 --> 01:23:11.640]   The next up on the right.
[01:23:11.640 --> 01:23:13.640]   We're excited.
[01:23:13.640 --> 01:23:14.640]   Keep your eye for an invite.
[01:23:14.640 --> 01:23:16.640]   I already got the invite.
[01:23:16.640 --> 01:23:18.640]   I don't know.
[01:23:18.640 --> 01:23:20.640]   Oh, I don't want to invite.
[01:23:20.640 --> 01:23:23.640]   If I just do maps.google.com/preview.
[01:23:23.640 --> 01:23:25.640]   Let's see.
[01:23:25.640 --> 01:23:27.640]   I'm getting redirected now.
[01:23:27.640 --> 01:23:28.640]   You are?
[01:23:28.640 --> 01:23:30.640]   Since I got, yeah, since I opted in.
[01:23:30.640 --> 01:23:32.640]   Just your general maps is right.
[01:23:32.640 --> 01:23:38.640]   This is the image that, no, I don't want to say that.
[01:23:38.640 --> 01:23:39.640]   They're cookies.
[01:23:39.640 --> 01:23:41.640]   Let's do maps.
[01:23:41.640 --> 01:23:46.640]   Pardon us, ladies and gentlemen, while Leo Fumpfers around.
[01:23:46.640 --> 01:23:47.640]   Okay.
[01:23:47.640 --> 01:23:48.640]   So this is the new one.
[01:23:48.640 --> 01:23:50.640]   So now how do I zoom out?
[01:23:50.640 --> 01:23:51.640]   I pinch.
[01:23:51.640 --> 01:23:58.640]   Maybe minus.
[01:23:58.640 --> 01:24:00.640]   Yeah, look, pinching.
[01:24:00.640 --> 01:24:01.640]   Pinching works.
[01:24:01.640 --> 01:24:03.640]   Let's see how much I can pinch.
[01:24:03.640 --> 01:24:04.640]   I got the U.S.
[01:24:04.640 --> 01:24:05.640]   I got that.
[01:24:05.640 --> 01:24:07.640]   You mean I can go beyond this?
[01:24:07.640 --> 01:24:08.640]   No, I can't.
[01:24:08.640 --> 01:24:10.640]   Switch to satellite.
[01:24:10.640 --> 01:24:13.640]   Now let's try it.
[01:24:13.640 --> 01:24:14.640]   Do I need a plug-in?
[01:24:14.640 --> 01:24:15.640]   There's no minus.
[01:24:15.640 --> 01:24:16.640]   Well, maybe never mind.
[01:24:16.640 --> 01:24:17.640]   Never mind.
[01:24:17.640 --> 01:24:20.640]   It looks so easy when he did it.
[01:24:20.640 --> 01:24:22.640]   All right, just one little pinch.
[01:24:22.640 --> 01:24:23.640]   It's all it takes.
[01:24:23.640 --> 01:24:26.640]   Just a pinch between cheek and gum.
[01:24:26.640 --> 01:24:27.640]   Not a thing.
[01:24:27.640 --> 01:24:29.640]   There's this new explore UI as well.
[01:24:29.640 --> 01:24:31.640]   I like the explore thing.
[01:24:31.640 --> 01:24:32.640]   Yeah.
[01:24:32.640 --> 01:24:34.640]   So I can just kind of click on pictures and stuff.
[01:24:34.640 --> 01:24:35.640]   There is, like, I guess a note around.
[01:24:35.640 --> 01:24:43.640]   And if you end up going to the Sistine Chapel, they showed that they showed pictures of being able to walk through Sistine Chapel all from users' photos.
[01:24:43.640 --> 01:24:44.640]   Yeah, users' photos.
[01:24:44.640 --> 01:24:47.640]   And again, they now recognize the better photos and they enhance them.
[01:24:47.640 --> 01:24:49.640]   So as long as you've made them public.
[01:24:49.640 --> 01:24:50.640]   Well, that's the question.
[01:24:50.640 --> 01:24:53.640]   What do I have to get permission to do that?
[01:24:53.640 --> 01:24:56.640]   I mean, you're inside a...
[01:24:56.640 --> 01:24:57.640]   Wow.
[01:24:57.640 --> 01:24:59.640]   The 3D is really spec.
[01:24:59.640 --> 01:25:02.640]   So this is the map's 3D rendering, right?
[01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:04.640]   These, I think, are photos from the consumers.
[01:25:04.640 --> 01:25:06.640]   Yeah, I think this is user-generated.
[01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:08.640]   So this is kind of like Microsoft's photos since...
[01:25:08.640 --> 01:25:09.640]   Yeah, yep.
[01:25:09.640 --> 01:25:10.640]   Exactly.
[01:25:10.640 --> 01:25:11.640]   Wow.
[01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:12.640]   This is the main.
[01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:14.640]   So I'm going around the...
[01:25:14.640 --> 01:25:16.640]   What are they running in the light?
[01:25:16.640 --> 01:25:18.640]   I mean, Florence.
[01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:20.640]   And this is the cathedral.
[01:25:20.640 --> 01:25:21.640]   This says this is light.
[01:25:21.640 --> 01:25:24.640]   3D Earth view is not available on your screen.
[01:25:24.640 --> 01:25:26.640]   Oh, so this is just pictures.
[01:25:26.640 --> 01:25:27.640]   Photos.
[01:25:27.640 --> 01:25:28.640]   Wow.
[01:25:28.640 --> 01:25:29.640]   Very nice.
[01:25:29.640 --> 01:25:31.640]   Very, very nice.
[01:25:31.640 --> 01:25:33.640]   What else?
[01:25:33.640 --> 01:25:34.640]   We didn't talk about search.
[01:25:34.640 --> 01:25:35.640]   You can look at the rundown.
[01:25:35.640 --> 01:25:37.640]   Oh, no, I think this is the most exciting thing, but we don't have it yet, right?
[01:25:37.640 --> 01:25:42.640]   You have to be participating in the beta search.
[01:25:42.640 --> 01:25:44.640]   This spoken word search.
[01:25:44.640 --> 01:25:48.640]   Now, on Glass, when you tap your temple, Gina, right, you say...
[01:25:48.640 --> 01:25:49.640]   Okay, Glass.
[01:25:49.640 --> 01:25:50.640]   And then you say, "Okay, Glass."
[01:25:50.640 --> 01:25:51.640]   Right.
[01:25:51.640 --> 01:25:52.640]   Now, on Search, you say, "Okay, Google."
[01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:53.640]   Okay, Google.
[01:25:53.640 --> 01:25:55.640]   Now, I don't know if that was a canned search.
[01:25:55.640 --> 01:25:56.640]   It didn't feel like it.
[01:25:56.640 --> 01:25:57.640]   She was.
[01:25:57.640 --> 01:25:58.640]   That was my bottle.
[01:25:58.640 --> 01:26:01.640]   And she said, "We're in a network, hostile environment.
[01:26:01.640 --> 01:26:02.640]   This might not work."
[01:26:02.640 --> 01:26:03.640]   And it worked absolutely perfectly.
[01:26:03.640 --> 01:26:04.640]   So she was nervous.
[01:26:04.640 --> 01:26:06.640]   This is a...
[01:26:06.640 --> 01:26:11.640]   Johanna Wright, I believe, who's a, I guess, a product director on Google Search.
[01:26:11.640 --> 01:26:13.640]   They had launched it that morning.
[01:26:13.640 --> 01:26:15.640]   Right, she said they launched it this morning.
[01:26:15.640 --> 01:26:16.640]   I don't know if this is going to work.
[01:26:16.640 --> 01:26:17.640]   It completely worked.
[01:26:17.640 --> 01:26:18.640]   Not only that.
[01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:19.640]   Oh, my God.
[01:26:19.640 --> 01:26:20.640]   It was amazing.
[01:26:20.640 --> 01:26:22.640]   She said, "How tall do you have to be to ride the giant dipper?"
[01:26:22.640 --> 01:26:23.640]   Yeah.
[01:26:23.640 --> 01:26:24.640]   I mean, this is...
[01:26:24.640 --> 01:26:27.640]   Now, we're seeing how 9,000-style artificial intelligence...
[01:26:27.640 --> 01:26:29.640]   Well, I know it was a series of queries.
[01:26:29.640 --> 01:26:30.640]   Natural speed.
[01:26:30.640 --> 01:26:31.640]   Yeah.
[01:26:31.640 --> 01:26:32.640]   How do I get to Santa Cruz?
[01:26:32.640 --> 01:26:33.640]   No, no, it was even more than that.
[01:26:33.640 --> 01:26:34.640]   It's better than that.
[01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:36.640]   She searched for Santa Cruz, and then she said, "How far is it?
[01:26:36.640 --> 01:26:37.640]   How far is it from here?"
[01:26:37.640 --> 01:26:38.640]   How far is it from here?
[01:26:38.640 --> 01:26:39.640]   Yes.
[01:26:39.640 --> 01:26:40.640]   It had to know it and here.
[01:26:40.640 --> 01:26:41.640]   It was contextual.
[01:26:41.640 --> 01:26:42.640]   It was contextual, right?
[01:26:42.640 --> 01:26:45.640]   There was a big theory around context in Google.
[01:26:45.640 --> 01:26:46.640]   Yeah.
[01:26:46.640 --> 01:26:49.640]   Also, in the maps, there's some little driveway going in that has no name.
[01:26:49.640 --> 01:26:54.640]   If you click on that place, it will now fill in all the streets you need to know to get there.
[01:26:54.640 --> 01:26:55.640]   Mm-hmm.
[01:26:55.640 --> 01:26:56.640]   Yeah, it was really cool.
[01:26:56.640 --> 01:26:57.640]   Context matters a lot.
[01:26:57.640 --> 01:26:58.640]   Yeah.
[01:26:58.640 --> 01:26:59.640]   Yeah.
[01:26:59.640 --> 01:27:00.640]   One is my flight leave.
[01:27:00.640 --> 01:27:03.640]   Ryan in our chat room says, "I'm in the beta and it does work that well."
[01:27:03.640 --> 01:27:04.640]   Wow.
[01:27:04.640 --> 01:27:05.640]   This is...
[01:27:05.640 --> 01:27:06.640]   Ryan, how do you tell us how you get into the beta?
[01:27:06.640 --> 01:27:07.640]   What is it you signed up for?
[01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:08.640]   Yeah, I didn't realize.
[01:27:08.640 --> 01:27:11.640]   Well, we'll just have to sign up for it somehow.
[01:27:11.640 --> 01:27:12.640]   Yeah.
[01:27:12.640 --> 01:27:17.160]   They mentioned like if you opted into the Gmail field trial where you let the Google search
[01:27:17.160 --> 01:27:20.640]   results look at your Gmail inbox, it would see your, for instance, flight reservation.
[01:27:20.640 --> 01:27:21.640]   Right.
[01:27:21.640 --> 01:27:23.480]   So when she said, "When does my flight leave?"
[01:27:23.480 --> 01:27:24.640]   And it said, "You came on Wednesday to 12."
[01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:25.640]   It has to do that already.
[01:27:25.640 --> 01:27:28.400]   It knew because it was looking at her Gmail inbox and people who have opted into the field
[01:27:28.400 --> 01:27:29.400]   trial that I had known now.
[01:27:29.400 --> 01:27:30.400]   Well, I'm in that field trial as well.
[01:27:30.400 --> 01:27:31.400]   So we'll have to see.
[01:27:31.400 --> 01:27:33.880]   When I got to the airport, it said, "Hey, you know, your flight's leaving.
[01:27:33.880 --> 01:27:34.880]   You should be leaving now."
[01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:37.560]   I got all that in Google now because I was in that field trial.
[01:27:37.560 --> 01:27:38.560]   So she was showing that.
[01:27:38.560 --> 01:27:41.360]   And there's a new voice action for Google now, which is reminders, right?
[01:27:41.360 --> 01:27:43.720]   So is your, okay, this is going to terrify people.
[01:27:43.720 --> 01:27:44.840]   Is your microphone always on?
[01:27:44.840 --> 01:27:48.320]   No, I believe that she tapped the microphone button.
[01:27:48.320 --> 01:27:49.320]   No, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:27:49.320 --> 01:27:51.240]   That was on the phone on the computer or she just talked to it.
[01:27:51.240 --> 01:27:52.240]   They called it Hot Words.
[01:27:52.240 --> 01:27:55.120]   Hot Words, listen for certain words.
[01:27:55.120 --> 01:27:56.120]   Okay, Google.
[01:27:56.120 --> 01:27:58.120]   Okay, Google.
[01:27:58.120 --> 01:27:59.120]   Okay, Google.
[01:27:59.120 --> 01:28:00.120]   I'm waiting.
[01:28:00.120 --> 01:28:01.120]   I'm waiting.
[01:28:01.120 --> 01:28:02.560]   I'm going to wait for, okay, Google.
[01:28:02.560 --> 01:28:03.560]   Get me a date.
[01:28:03.560 --> 01:28:04.560]   Peacock.
[01:28:04.560 --> 01:28:05.560]   Peacock.
[01:28:05.560 --> 01:28:06.560]   Okay, Google.
[01:28:06.560 --> 01:28:07.760]   No, apparently I'm not in that.
[01:28:07.760 --> 01:28:08.760]   Hot Words is not.
[01:28:08.760 --> 01:28:09.760]   Okay.
[01:28:09.760 --> 01:28:10.760]   Oh, apparently I'm not in that.
[01:28:10.760 --> 01:28:13.760]   Hot Words is not enabled.
[01:28:13.760 --> 01:28:14.760]   We're sitting here.
[01:28:14.760 --> 01:28:15.760]   This is a Louis C.K.
[01:28:15.760 --> 01:28:16.760]   Moment.
[01:28:16.760 --> 01:28:17.760]   We're sitting here.
[01:28:17.760 --> 01:28:23.160]   We're, we watched this movie when I was a kid in the theaters called 2001 A Space Odyssey.
[01:28:23.160 --> 01:28:24.160]   And the guy's talking to the computer.
[01:28:24.160 --> 01:28:25.160]   He's talking back.
[01:28:25.160 --> 01:28:26.520]   I kept waiting for that moment.
[01:28:26.520 --> 01:28:27.520]   It just happened, folks.
[01:28:27.520 --> 01:28:31.240]   And we're sitting there going, well, I don't know if I want that microphone to be.
[01:28:31.240 --> 01:28:32.240]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:34.240]   I don't know if I like that.
[01:28:34.240 --> 01:28:37.560]   You're talking to the computer and it's answering your questions.
[01:28:37.560 --> 01:28:38.560]   It's amazing.
[01:28:38.560 --> 01:28:39.560]   It is amazing.
[01:28:39.560 --> 01:28:40.560]   You're talking to the computer.
[01:28:40.560 --> 01:28:41.560]   Yeah.
[01:28:41.560 --> 01:28:42.560]   Nobody's happy.
[01:28:42.560 --> 01:28:43.560]   Nobody's happy.
[01:28:43.560 --> 01:28:44.560]   Negativity is, we don't know about the future.
[01:28:44.560 --> 01:28:45.560]   There'll be a negative.
[01:28:45.560 --> 01:28:48.560]   You know, we shouldn't be happy is Apple because this kicks series.
[01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:49.560]   Siri.
[01:28:49.560 --> 01:28:51.040]   Did Sepakoo today.
[01:28:51.040 --> 01:28:55.160]   Kicks series, but I mean seriously.
[01:28:55.160 --> 01:28:56.960]   Okay, I'm sorry.
[01:28:56.960 --> 01:29:00.760]   I think we saw Siri on 101 coming up here on the side of the road.
[01:29:00.760 --> 01:29:01.760]   Yeah.
[01:29:01.760 --> 01:29:02.760]   Roadkill.
[01:29:02.760 --> 01:29:03.760]   Wow.
[01:29:03.760 --> 01:29:07.160]   I mean, I can't wait.
[01:29:07.160 --> 01:29:08.960]   Don't you want to be in that?
[01:29:08.960 --> 01:29:09.960]   Yes.
[01:29:09.960 --> 01:29:13.120]   So I do think you have to tap the mic to start to speak your search.
[01:29:13.120 --> 01:29:15.360]   Much like with Glass, you have to tap the mic.
[01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:16.360]   You know what?
[01:29:16.360 --> 01:29:19.680]   The Macintosh has voice dictation and you tap the function key twice to turn it on.
[01:29:19.680 --> 01:29:20.680]   Yeah, to turn it on, right?
[01:29:20.680 --> 01:29:22.440]   Because the mic's not going to be always be open.
[01:29:22.440 --> 01:29:24.320]   That doesn't make sense.
[01:29:24.320 --> 01:29:25.320]   It doesn't need to be.
[01:29:25.320 --> 01:29:26.320]   Maybe that's a feature, though.
[01:29:26.320 --> 01:29:27.840]   I wouldn't mind being able to turn that on.
[01:29:27.840 --> 01:29:28.840]   Just having the mic on.
[01:29:28.840 --> 01:29:29.840]   Yeah, why not?
[01:29:29.840 --> 01:29:30.840]   Well, speaking of, did you?
[01:29:30.840 --> 01:29:31.840]   I wanted to talk to me.
[01:29:31.840 --> 01:29:32.840]   Did you notice these little cards?
[01:29:32.840 --> 01:29:34.000]   Yeah, when we picked up our pixels, there were these things.
[01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.120]   I'm collecting data here.
[01:29:36.120 --> 01:29:37.120]   So Google, I don't know.
[01:29:37.120 --> 01:29:38.120]   Look at these things.
[01:29:38.120 --> 01:29:43.440]   These cards with Arduino boards mounted to them with sensors that, and these cards say,
[01:29:43.440 --> 01:29:46.080]   "I'm collecting data here," which is really ironic when you're out of Google.
[01:29:46.080 --> 01:29:47.080]   It's often not.
[01:29:47.080 --> 01:29:49.120]   Are you just, of course, Google's collecting data.
[01:29:49.120 --> 01:29:50.120]   It's all the time.
[01:29:50.120 --> 01:29:56.640]   500 sensor modes and over 4,000 data streams continuously monitoring temperature, humidity,
[01:29:56.640 --> 01:30:01.520]   pressure, light, air quality, motion, and both RF and audio noise levels all through the
[01:30:01.520 --> 01:30:07.640]   Moscone Center at I/O because they want to get a sense of what areas of the conference
[01:30:07.640 --> 01:30:09.640]   you haven't shared that picture, have you?
[01:30:09.640 --> 01:30:13.960]   So if you want to do it, you can write a simple app to find out which group has the most
[01:30:13.960 --> 01:30:15.120]   bodysheated on Twitter.
[01:30:15.120 --> 01:30:16.120]   I did.
[01:30:16.120 --> 01:30:17.120]   I shared it on Twitter.
[01:30:17.120 --> 01:30:19.600]   Is that, is that, are you disappointed?
[01:30:19.600 --> 01:30:21.760]   Well, I went to your Google+, I thought.
[01:30:21.760 --> 01:30:22.760]   For sure.
[01:30:22.760 --> 01:30:25.000]   So these were all throughout.
[01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:29.080]   This is where we picked up our pixels, but they're all throughout the Moscone.
[01:30:29.080 --> 01:30:30.280]   So I thought a school is on the notice.
[01:30:30.280 --> 01:30:31.280]   What is that all about?
[01:30:31.280 --> 01:30:32.280]   What are they doing, you think?
[01:30:32.280 --> 01:30:35.400]   They're just, this is Google Analytics for the conference.
[01:30:35.400 --> 01:30:37.080]   This is Mute, Mute Space, Google Analytics.
[01:30:37.080 --> 01:30:40.080]   They're trying to see which areas of the conference are people most interested in, what's most popular.
[01:30:40.080 --> 01:30:41.920]   They're trying to get people into sensor data and doing all that.
[01:30:41.920 --> 01:30:43.880]   They want to know which areas are more humid.
[01:30:43.880 --> 01:30:45.880]   Which ones are noisier, got more--
[01:30:45.880 --> 01:30:47.800]   Whatever sensors exist, what could you possibly learn?
[01:30:47.800 --> 01:30:49.360]   You could learn the more people are in this space.
[01:30:49.360 --> 01:30:50.360]   Here it is, Chad.
[01:30:50.360 --> 01:30:51.640]   I don't know if you can see that.
[01:30:51.640 --> 01:30:54.120]   I'm collecting data here.
[01:30:54.120 --> 01:30:57.160]   As Larry said, your phone is soon going to have all those sensors.
[01:30:57.160 --> 01:30:58.160]   Who knows what to do with that?
[01:30:58.160 --> 01:30:59.160]   It does.
[01:30:59.160 --> 01:31:00.160]   The GS4 has a humidity sensor.
[01:31:00.160 --> 01:31:01.160]   It has temperature.
[01:31:01.160 --> 01:31:03.160]   In fact, the GS4 will tell me as I'm--
[01:31:03.160 --> 01:31:04.160]   Does it give you your humidity?
[01:31:04.160 --> 01:31:05.160]   It does.
[01:31:05.160 --> 01:31:06.160]   It's a practical or--
[01:31:06.160 --> 01:31:09.880]   I don't have to wear a Fitbit anymore because it's tracking my steps.
[01:31:09.880 --> 01:31:12.960]   It also says there's a comfort quotient.
[01:31:12.960 --> 01:31:16.400]   It's very interesting what's going on.
[01:31:16.400 --> 01:31:18.800]   This is basically the same as that Arduino.
[01:31:18.800 --> 01:31:20.760]   Yeah, this was-- I just think it's funny.
[01:31:20.760 --> 01:31:22.320]   I think Google just needs to have the sign everywhere.
[01:31:22.320 --> 01:31:23.320]   I'm collecting data here.
[01:31:23.320 --> 01:31:24.320]   I'm collecting data here.
[01:31:24.320 --> 01:31:27.640]   No matter what you-- and whenever you interact with Google, I should say that.
[01:31:27.640 --> 01:31:29.640]   Oh, that's my phone turning on.
[01:31:29.640 --> 01:31:31.040]   I don't think it's charging from this.
[01:31:31.040 --> 01:31:34.760]   It might need more draw than the Pixel can handle.
[01:31:34.760 --> 01:31:35.760]   Oh, geez.
[01:31:35.760 --> 01:31:36.760]   It's hard as mine.
[01:31:36.760 --> 01:31:37.760]   Just mine.
[01:31:37.760 --> 01:31:38.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:31:38.760 --> 01:31:41.360]   Anything else.
[01:31:41.360 --> 01:31:42.360]   There was so much.
[01:31:42.360 --> 01:31:43.360]   I don't want to miss anything.
[01:31:43.360 --> 01:31:44.360]   We're almost done here.
[01:31:44.360 --> 01:31:46.080]   I think we covered search.
[01:31:46.080 --> 01:31:47.080]   We covered maps.
[01:31:47.080 --> 01:31:49.240]   That search thing was the thing that blew my mind.
[01:31:49.240 --> 01:31:52.200]   Yeah, the search thing was really cool.
[01:31:52.200 --> 01:31:56.000]   I feel like we're really watching the future on the front of us.
[01:31:56.000 --> 01:31:57.000]   It's very exciting.
[01:31:57.000 --> 01:31:58.000]   It is.
[01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:00.000]   So we're not doing numbers and tips?
[01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:01.000]   Let's do numbers and tips.
[01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:02.000]   Do you have a--
[01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:03.000]   I'm completely unprepared.
[01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:04.000]   I'm completely unprepared.
[01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:05.000]   So then I'll give you a number.
[01:32:05.000 --> 01:32:06.560]   Why don't you give us a number?
[01:32:06.560 --> 01:32:09.000]   Google stock closed today at 907.07.
[01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:10.000]   [WHISTLE]
[01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:11.000]   Up 19 points.
[01:32:11.000 --> 01:32:14.000]   19-- 2019 bucks.
[01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:15.000]   Wow.
[01:32:15.000 --> 01:32:18.000]   Apple down 15 bucks.
[01:32:18.000 --> 01:32:19.000]   Ooh.
[01:32:19.000 --> 01:32:22.560]   Facebook down 24 cents.
[01:32:22.560 --> 01:32:26.960]   Yeah, Adobe didn't get hurt, but they priced it already a little bit.
[01:32:26.960 --> 01:32:31.080]   Yeah, I think that the stock market knows something.
[01:32:31.080 --> 01:32:32.520]   I think that's pretty accurate.
[01:32:32.520 --> 01:32:34.400]   I'm very afraid 4-square with the maps release.
[01:32:34.400 --> 01:32:35.560]   Yeah, who got Sherlock?
[01:32:35.560 --> 01:32:37.080]   4-square did, perhaps?
[01:32:37.080 --> 01:32:38.080]   Maybe.
[01:32:38.080 --> 01:32:39.080]   Again, I like those guys so much.
[01:32:39.080 --> 01:32:42.440]   But they moved away from gamification, which I think might have been a mistake.
[01:32:42.440 --> 01:32:43.440]   That's what--
[01:32:43.440 --> 01:32:44.440]   Yeah, maybe--
[01:32:44.440 --> 01:32:44.440]   But this is--
[01:32:44.440 --> 01:32:46.640]   They call themselves the location layer of the net.
[01:32:46.640 --> 01:32:47.640]   Yeah, no, I'm sorry.
[01:32:47.640 --> 01:32:49.280]   And this is very close to what Google's doing, right?
[01:32:49.280 --> 01:32:50.840]   Did you see if you clicked on a venue?
[01:32:50.840 --> 01:32:54.720]   Like, if you clicked on a museum, it would light up other museums that were similar around
[01:32:54.720 --> 01:32:55.720]   the area, right?
[01:32:55.720 --> 01:32:56.720]   And if you--
[01:32:56.720 --> 01:32:58.720]   Also, if you asked for restaurants, it would give you a social layer that would tell you
[01:32:58.720 --> 01:33:01.320]   what restaurants your friends and dog, which is like, what first-world--
[01:33:01.320 --> 01:33:03.680]   I like that concept of my map.
[01:33:03.680 --> 01:33:05.520]   So you could say, I really like this restaurant.
[01:33:05.520 --> 01:33:07.200]   This is a place where-- which is on my map.
[01:33:07.200 --> 01:33:11.200]   And I measure things by how close it is to that.
[01:33:11.200 --> 01:33:13.480]   It sounds awful lot like 4-square.
[01:33:13.480 --> 01:33:14.480]   Yeah.
[01:33:14.480 --> 01:33:17.320]   What else?
[01:33:17.320 --> 01:33:18.320]   What else?
[01:33:18.320 --> 01:33:19.480]   Who else got Sherlock today?
[01:33:19.480 --> 01:33:20.480]   Not Adobe.
[01:33:20.480 --> 01:33:22.240]   I think a lot of this is the same square at Facebook.
[01:33:22.240 --> 01:33:24.240]   It doesn't mean it's going to hurt Facebook.
[01:33:24.240 --> 01:33:27.800]   But I think Google really wants to be an alternative for Facebook users.
[01:33:27.800 --> 01:33:29.800]   Did Pandora spotify you?
[01:33:29.800 --> 01:33:30.800]   Maybe.
[01:33:30.800 --> 01:33:31.800]   What does it cost?
[01:33:31.800 --> 01:33:32.800]   What does it cost?
[01:33:32.800 --> 01:33:33.800]   What does Spotify cost?
[01:33:33.800 --> 01:33:34.800]   Ten bucks.
[01:33:34.800 --> 01:33:35.800]   Everything's ten--
[01:33:35.800 --> 01:33:36.800]   Everything's ten bucks.
[01:33:36.800 --> 01:33:37.800]   That's the standard.
[01:33:37.800 --> 01:33:38.800]   Yeah, across the board.
[01:33:38.800 --> 01:33:42.200]   Do you think that this will be enough to get people to move back to Google Plus?
[01:33:42.200 --> 01:33:46.680]   Do you think this-- Google's not giving up on Google Plus, and they continue to add
[01:33:46.680 --> 01:33:49.840]   features to the community's features, so it's a great addition.
[01:33:49.840 --> 01:33:50.840]   The new look is great photos.
[01:33:50.840 --> 01:33:52.440]   It's not going to be anything itself.
[01:33:52.440 --> 01:33:56.280]   I think that, for example, the fact that you can use Google Plus circles for Gina's
[01:33:56.280 --> 01:34:00.200]   beta, she's just going to want friends to be on there so they can be beta testers on
[01:34:00.200 --> 01:34:01.200]   her apps.
[01:34:01.200 --> 01:34:02.200]   Right.
[01:34:02.200 --> 01:34:04.400]   It's those little things that get you going there.
[01:34:04.400 --> 01:34:05.400]   Plus isn't a product.
[01:34:05.400 --> 01:34:06.800]   It's the backbone of all the other products.
[01:34:06.800 --> 01:34:07.800]   It's the social layer.
[01:34:07.800 --> 01:34:10.800]   You have to not think about plus.google.com.
[01:34:10.800 --> 01:34:17.320]   I think about plus is Android app reviews, as gaming invitations, as beta testing invitations,
[01:34:17.320 --> 01:34:18.480]   as comments on blogs or whatever.
[01:34:18.480 --> 01:34:21.360]   And as people you actually enjoy talking with, which is what happens to me, I have a better
[01:34:21.360 --> 01:34:22.360]   conversation there.
[01:34:22.360 --> 01:34:26.320]   I'm still frustrated as hell, Google, that--
[01:34:26.320 --> 01:34:28.320]   We needed a Jeff Rant.
[01:34:28.320 --> 01:34:29.320]   Yeah.
[01:34:29.320 --> 01:34:35.400]   I cannot get-- I had to sign on with the Google Gmail account.
[01:34:35.400 --> 01:34:37.680]   That's what my Plus account still is.
[01:34:37.680 --> 01:34:39.320]   Everything else in my life is my apps account.
[01:34:39.320 --> 01:34:40.320]   Right.
[01:34:40.320 --> 01:34:42.480]   And a friend of mine, Rex Hammack, switched over.
[01:34:42.480 --> 01:34:44.240]   And he lost a lot on the way.
[01:34:44.240 --> 01:34:45.240]   He did.
[01:34:45.240 --> 01:34:47.240]   And you know, Glass doesn't work with apps account.
[01:34:47.240 --> 01:34:48.240]   They got to solve that problem.
[01:34:48.240 --> 01:34:49.240]   They really have to.
[01:34:49.240 --> 01:34:50.240]   They really have to.
[01:34:50.240 --> 01:34:51.240]   It's honestly.
[01:34:51.240 --> 01:34:52.240]   I saw the roadmap.
[01:34:52.240 --> 01:34:54.440]   I just think it's a secondary rollout.
[01:34:54.440 --> 01:34:55.440]   Yeah.
[01:34:55.440 --> 01:34:57.640]   It's a hashtag rich geeks problem.
[01:34:57.640 --> 01:34:58.640]   Ways.
[01:34:58.640 --> 01:34:59.640]   Ways might be in a little bit of--
[01:34:59.640 --> 01:35:00.640]   Ways, ways, yes.
[01:35:00.640 --> 01:35:03.480]   There were rumors that Google was looking to buy ways for a billion dollars.
[01:35:03.480 --> 01:35:04.480]   No, Facebook was looking to buy--
[01:35:04.480 --> 01:35:05.480]   Facebook was looking to buy--
[01:35:05.480 --> 01:35:06.480]   Facebook.
[01:35:06.480 --> 01:35:07.480]   Facebook.
[01:35:07.480 --> 01:35:08.480]   Not Google, Facebook.
[01:35:08.480 --> 01:35:09.480]   And now I understand why.
[01:35:09.480 --> 01:35:10.560]   Maybe this was a defensive move if they had known that Maps was going to start including
[01:35:10.560 --> 01:35:11.560]   not only traffic information.
[01:35:11.560 --> 01:35:12.560]   Or they had incident--
[01:35:12.560 --> 01:35:14.560]   Incidents reports.
[01:35:14.560 --> 01:35:15.560]   And reroute around incidents.
[01:35:15.560 --> 01:35:16.560]   Reroute is a important thing.
[01:35:16.560 --> 01:35:17.560]   I got addicted to ways.
[01:35:17.560 --> 01:35:18.560]   I had to go to mean--
[01:35:18.560 --> 01:35:19.560]   Love ways.
[01:35:19.560 --> 01:35:20.560]   --aways ago.
[01:35:20.560 --> 01:35:21.720]   And boy, it was wondrous, taking me around.
[01:35:21.720 --> 01:35:24.960]   And if you're already using Google navigation, it does the same thing you might--
[01:35:24.960 --> 01:35:25.960]   I think I don't know.
[01:35:25.960 --> 01:35:28.400]   Google also listened to signals on the phone or where the traffic is.
[01:35:28.400 --> 01:35:30.200]   How was it getting where the traffic is dating?
[01:35:30.200 --> 01:35:35.360]   You know, maybe my memory is mistaken, but I just think I saw him say you can also report
[01:35:35.360 --> 01:35:39.040]   incidents that there was a report feature which is how ways were.
[01:35:39.040 --> 01:35:42.040]   Well, but no ways really works from watching your phone and how fast it's going on the
[01:35:42.040 --> 01:35:43.040]   road.
[01:35:43.040 --> 01:35:48.920]   It knows the speed, but it wants you to report if you see road kill, a cop, an accident,
[01:35:48.920 --> 01:35:49.920]   all of that stuff--
[01:35:49.920 --> 01:35:50.920]   Google Maps has never done that.
[01:35:50.920 --> 01:35:51.920]   I mean, you've just never done that.
[01:35:51.920 --> 01:35:52.920]   But I'm wondering if that's new.
[01:35:52.920 --> 01:35:53.920]   Yes.
[01:35:53.920 --> 01:35:54.920]   Yeah.
[01:35:54.920 --> 01:35:55.920]   And I think that's a great thing.
[01:35:55.920 --> 01:35:56.920]   And I think that's a great thing.

[01:38:50.920 --> 01:38:51.920]   I guess.
[01:38:51.920 --> 01:38:53.920]   But there are announcements that happen in developer sessions, right?
[01:38:53.920 --> 01:38:55.920]   Like not all the announcements happen in the keynote.
[01:38:55.920 --> 01:38:56.920]   I mean, the major announcements happen in the keynote.
[01:38:56.920 --> 01:38:57.920]   Well, in fact, somebody said-- and I don't know.
[01:38:57.920 --> 01:38:59.920]   I haven't confirmed this, but somebody in the chat room said they've announced that
[01:38:59.920 --> 01:39:05.640]   YouTube Live is now available to any channel with more than, I think, 1,000 subscribers,
[01:39:05.640 --> 01:39:07.360]   which we would qualify for.
[01:39:07.360 --> 01:39:08.360]   So we'll investigate that.
[01:39:08.360 --> 01:39:12.920]   I thought Aaron said the Google TV minute announcement actually on their--
[01:39:12.920 --> 01:39:14.920]   GuderX says Google TV got an update today.
[01:39:14.920 --> 01:39:17.920]   I don't know how much of an update.
[01:39:17.920 --> 01:39:19.920]   Oh, what they didn't mention is Android 4.3.
[01:39:19.920 --> 01:39:20.920]   No, not a word.
[01:39:20.920 --> 01:39:21.920]   No, not a word.
[01:39:21.920 --> 01:39:26.920]   In fact, they did say-- and this is the only word-- that the Galaxy S4 with pure Google
[01:39:26.920 --> 01:39:28.920]   experience will be 4.2.
[01:39:28.920 --> 01:39:29.920]   And that's next month.
[01:39:29.920 --> 01:39:30.920]   That's right.
[01:39:30.920 --> 01:39:31.920]   But you know what?
[01:39:31.920 --> 01:39:34.920]   With all the cool tools that developers got, I wasn't even that disappointed.
[01:39:34.920 --> 01:39:35.920]   Oh, my god.
[01:39:35.920 --> 01:39:36.920]   I got a new ID.
[01:39:36.920 --> 01:39:37.920]   In fact, maybe it's even better.
[01:39:37.920 --> 01:39:38.920]   Maybe it's better.
[01:39:38.920 --> 01:39:39.920]   Let's stick with 4.2 for a little longer.
[01:39:39.920 --> 01:39:40.920]   I think that they're just pushing developers.
[01:39:40.920 --> 01:39:43.920]   They want developers to make their apps tabloid-- or tabloid.
[01:39:43.920 --> 01:39:44.920]   Tablet.
[01:39:44.920 --> 01:39:45.920]   Whoa.
[01:39:45.920 --> 01:39:46.920]   Do you want to call them?
[01:39:46.920 --> 01:39:48.920]   Tablet ready.
[01:39:48.920 --> 01:39:49.920]   Tablet ready, too.
[01:39:49.920 --> 01:39:50.920]   I don't know.
[01:39:50.920 --> 01:39:51.920]   I don't think they need 4.3.
[01:39:51.920 --> 01:39:53.920]   I mean, let's sit in 4.2 for a little while.
[01:39:53.920 --> 01:39:54.920]   It's pretty good.
[01:39:54.920 --> 01:39:55.920]   It's pretty darn good.
[01:39:55.920 --> 01:39:56.920]   Pretty good.
[01:39:56.920 --> 01:40:00.920]   And this will solve this issue of people feeling left behind because, you know, frankly,
[01:40:00.920 --> 01:40:04.920]   this phone is going to be behind and a lot of other phones are going to be behind because
[01:40:04.920 --> 01:40:05.920]   the carriers don't want the updates.
[01:40:05.920 --> 01:40:06.920]   Just a few more.
[01:40:06.920 --> 01:40:11.920]   And there was also the Wallet Instant Buy API where everybody's still trying to become the
[01:40:11.920 --> 01:40:12.920]   Instant Buy.
[01:40:12.920 --> 01:40:15.920]   And they listed 22 steps to do any buy.
[01:40:15.920 --> 01:40:20.920]   They said 98% or 97% of all shopping carts on mobile are abandoned.
[01:40:20.920 --> 01:40:21.920]   Are abandoned, yeah.
[01:40:21.920 --> 01:40:22.920]   Because it's too much of a pain.
[01:40:22.920 --> 01:40:23.920]   So they're trying to make their own behavior.
[01:40:23.920 --> 01:40:24.920]   Exactly.
[01:40:24.920 --> 01:40:25.920]   What?
[01:40:25.920 --> 01:40:26.920]   I have to fill something in.
[01:40:26.920 --> 01:40:27.920]   Okay, see, yeah.
[01:40:27.920 --> 01:40:28.920]   I believe that.
[01:40:28.920 --> 01:40:29.920]   Yeah, I believe that, too.
[01:40:29.920 --> 01:40:30.920]   Yeah, totally believe that.
[01:40:30.920 --> 01:40:31.920]   All right.
[01:40:31.920 --> 01:40:32.920]   I think you had a number.
[01:40:32.920 --> 01:40:33.920]   We don't have anything.
[01:40:33.920 --> 01:40:34.920]   I think we're done.
[01:40:34.920 --> 01:40:35.920]   I think I did.
[01:40:35.920 --> 01:40:36.920]   You are.
[01:40:36.920 --> 01:40:37.920]   I did my homework.
[01:40:37.920 --> 01:40:38.920]   You didn't do that.
[01:40:38.920 --> 01:40:39.920]   Download all the new stuff.
[01:40:39.920 --> 01:40:40.920]   That's my tip.
[01:40:40.920 --> 01:40:41.920]   Yeah, that's good stuff.
[01:40:41.920 --> 01:40:46.920]   Thank you, everybody, for putting up with us almost as long as the keynote.
[01:40:46.920 --> 01:40:52.920]   Normally we do this week in Google on Wednesdays, 1 p.m. Pacific, 4 p.m. Eastern Time.
[01:40:52.920 --> 01:40:54.920]   That's 2000 UTC on Twit.tv.
[01:40:54.920 --> 01:40:56.920]   We do love it when you watch live.
[01:40:56.920 --> 01:40:58.920]   As you see, we use the chat room an awful lot.
[01:40:58.920 --> 01:41:04.920]   But if you can't please download after the fact VOD version, video or audio, AOD on demand,
[01:41:04.920 --> 01:41:07.920]   at Twit.tv/twig or subscribe.
[01:41:07.920 --> 01:41:11.920]   Any Android podcast client will do it.
[01:41:11.920 --> 01:41:15.920]   So we'll, whatever you use on your desktop, iTunes or the Zoom marketplace.
[01:41:15.920 --> 01:41:16.920]   So we're there.
[01:41:16.920 --> 01:41:18.920]   Just search for Twig.
[01:41:18.920 --> 01:41:20.920]   I'm really glad that you guys could come up and see us.
[01:41:20.920 --> 01:41:21.920]   This is awesome.
[01:41:21.920 --> 01:41:22.920]   This is great to have you here.
[01:41:22.920 --> 01:41:23.920]   Three pixels in a row.
[01:41:23.920 --> 01:41:24.920]   Yeah.
[01:41:24.920 --> 01:41:25.920]   Wow.
[01:41:25.920 --> 01:41:26.920]   That's the last time that's going to happen.
[01:41:26.920 --> 01:41:28.920]   Yeah, this is never going to happen again.
[01:41:28.920 --> 01:41:30.920]   No, no, it's not going to happen again.
[01:41:30.920 --> 01:41:32.920]   What is the Easter egg you do?
[01:41:32.920 --> 01:41:33.920]   It's up, down, up, down, left, right, left, right.
[01:41:33.920 --> 01:41:35.920]   What is the one to make this cycle?
[01:41:35.920 --> 01:41:37.920]   Or if you just shut it, it'll do it.
[01:41:37.920 --> 01:41:39.920]   No, no, but it does this special thing.
[01:41:39.920 --> 01:41:41.920]   So what is the Nintendo code?
[01:41:41.920 --> 01:41:43.920]   Say that loud.
[01:41:43.920 --> 01:41:48.920]   Up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right.
[01:41:48.920 --> 01:41:51.920]   And then possibly B-A.
[01:41:51.920 --> 01:41:53.920]   Oh, there you go.
[01:41:53.920 --> 01:41:54.920]   Oh, that's a light shot.
[01:41:54.920 --> 01:41:56.920]   Now I like the pixel.
[01:41:56.920 --> 01:41:57.920]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:41:57.920 --> 01:41:59.920]   We'll see you next time on Twig.
[01:41:59.920 --> 01:42:04.920]   Mmm, mm, mm.
