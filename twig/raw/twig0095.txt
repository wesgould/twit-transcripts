[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.880]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:05.920]   Netcast you love.
[00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:07.280]   From people you trust.
[00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.120]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.840]   This is Twig.
[00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.600]   Bandwidth for this week in Google is provided by cash fly,
[00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.680]   C-A-C-H-E-F-L-Y.com.
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.160]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.480]   This is Twig.
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.240]   This week in Google, episode 95,
[00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.000]   recorded May 18, 2011.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.400]   The algo is complicated.
[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.360]   This week in Google is brought to you by Squarespace.com.
[00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.240]   The fast and easy way to create a high quality website
[00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:46.360]   or blog for a free 14-day trial, go to squarespace.com/twig.

[00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.000]   of up to 20% of them.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.840]   It's time for Twig.
[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.320]   This week in Google, Gina Trapani is here.
[00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.840]   Am I saying that right now?
[00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:57.840]   No.
[00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:58.880]   How do you say it?
[00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:59.760]   Not Trapani.
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.640]   Trapani is how I say it.
[00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.720]   Trapani is OK, too.
[00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:04.640]   Trapani.
[00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.120]   Gina Trapani is here.
[00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.760]   I'm sorry.
[00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.320]   Gina, I've been mispronouncing her name for 94 episodes.
[00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.240]   No, no, no.
[00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.920]   Trapani is a completely valid pronunciation.
[00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.400]   But Trapani is not.
[00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.080]   Even at Google I/O last week, you could have slapped me upside
[00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.160]   the head and said, say my name right.
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.000]   But no, she's just too nice.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.720]   No, it's all good.
[00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.120]   I'm down with those two pronunciations.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.520]   But Trapani, no.
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:28.040]   Trapani.
[00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.400]   I'm wrong from now on because now--
[00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.400]   To make a tomato, Leo, it's OK.
[00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.840]   I'm not going to get every possible variation now.
[00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:36.280]   Yeah, I'll never get it right.
[00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.200]   That's Jeff Jarvis from Buzzmachine.com.
[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.400]   Easy to say.
[00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.120]   Yes.
[00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.800]   He's a professor.
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.040]   He should know.
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.880]   So Jeff, Gina, and I will talk about this week in Google.
[00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.360]   And actually, before the show began,
[00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.240]   we were talking about a TED talk that's been making the rounds.
[00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.400]   Is it Eli Parracer?
[00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.040]   Is that his name?
[00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.280]   Jeff, you're going to debate him.
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.240]   That way, no, no.
[00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.080]   I don't know.
[00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.600]   Parracer.
[00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.360]   He's an evening runner.
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.520]   Gina, Purser, whatever.
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.600]   Purser, I have no idea.
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.760]   He's from moveon.org, which is, I think,
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.680]   a respectable political site.
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.160]   And he did a TED talk on something called Filter Bubbles,
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:17.200]   saying that, customize search from companies like Facebook,
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.360]   The Huffington Post, Google, kind of disenfranchised people
[00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.600]   because we end up seeing just the stuff we want to see,
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.400]   and that stuff we ought to see.
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.000]   It's the old echo chamber argument
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.640]   that I think is exactly the opposite for a few reasons.
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.120]   One is there was no worse at echo chamber
[00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.600]   than an old media property, like a newspaper,
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.640]   where one editor picked stuff for us.
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.320]   Now I have far more serendipity.
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.640]   I have far more choice.
[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.320]   Second, turn it off.
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.080]   And what you get is the same thing everybody else has.
[00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.920]   What he's doing is turning this all into a mass again.
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.360]   We're finally escaping the mass.
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.440]   I don't want to go back to that where we all supposedly
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:52.160]   watch the same thing.
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.840]   We don't care about that.
[00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:53.680]   That's a good point.
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.440]   I mean, you can clearly make the point, I'm sure,
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.920]   Google does, that this kind of search personalization
[00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:59.640]   is what people want.
[00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.600]   They want results that are more like what they're looking for.
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:03.280]   It's relevance.
[00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.240]   Do I want irrelevant?
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.640]   I want other noise?
[00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.200]   No, I want reduced noise.
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.840]   And then I think that the idea that this somehow ill
[00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:14.040]   service us, that we should have the same thing as everyone else,
[00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.840]   is to say, really is a problem of thinking of us as a mass.
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.760]   It's kind of a hard me for this now,
[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.360]   professed professorial moment.
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.240]   It's a hopper-mossed moment.
[00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.080]   What's that?
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.560]   It's saying that we're all in the same public sphere.
[00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.600]   And the entire value of these new tools
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.480]   is that we can create our own publics and our own worlds.
[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.280]   All right, but what do you say to the fact
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.880]   that we no longer have serendipity?
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.240]   That serendipity helped expose us to viewpoints
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.920]   we didn't agree with?
[00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.640]   I have far more serendipity than ever.
[00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:47.240]   Editors define serendipity as that which they fed you.
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.240]   That's true.
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.640]   The definition of serendipity that I have--
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:53.560]   And the Guardian tried a while ago as a joke
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.040]   to do a serendipity generator.
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.240]   It was a random generator of stories.
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.920]   And I'm sure Steve and the choir show
[00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.840]   would explain to me how it's not exactly random.
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:02.640]   I won't understand.
[00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:03.240]   Pseudo-random.
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:04.120]   Just pseudo-random.
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.920]   It's a pseudo-random list of stories.
[00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.440]   And I said, that's not serendipity.
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.240]   Serendipity is not randomness.
[00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.560]   Serendipity, in my definition, is unexpected relevance.
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:13.360]   Yes.
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.720]   Oh, I didn't know that.
[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.040]   I'm glad I know that now.
[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:17.960]   That's interesting to me.
[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:19.520]   I wouldn't have known that'd be interesting to me, right?
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:20.160]   That kind of stuff.
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:20.800]   I like that.
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.040]   And you want that.
[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.680]   That's the kind of thing that people say, well,
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.840]   when you browse in a bookstore, you'll come upon things
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:28.400]   you didn't know.
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.600]   When you look on Amazon, everything's direct results.
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.200]   You don't see that.
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.680]   Right.
[00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.560]   So I get a tremendous amount on this last point on July.
[00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.920]   And by the way, I'm going to debate him on these points
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.240]   at the 92nd Street Y on, I think, October 3 in New York.
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.600]   Good.
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:44.800]   On my book of then.
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:45.840]   That sounds good.
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.600]   Listening to the talk, he said that--
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:49.680]   I'm just giving up everything.
[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:50.680]   I'm going to say that.
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:51.480]   And so what the heck?
[00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:52.240]   Yeah, well, no, that's OK.
[00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.560]   You're giving him ammunition, though.
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.080]   So Eli, please don't watch this.
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.480]   Yeah.
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:59.320]   The other point was that he talked about Facebook
[00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:03.600]   editing the web as if we had access to the entire web
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.440]   of everything, and Facebook was bringing it down.
[00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:07.640]   No, it's a very different concept.
[00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:10.960]   Facebook is curating things for us.
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:12.400]   And he got all shocked.
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.240]   The example he gives is that I'm a political guy.
[00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.880]   I'm progressive.
[00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:18.920]   Otherwise, no one is liberal.
[00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.320]   It's OK if I were to be heard.
[00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:21.760]   Progressive is the new liberal.
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:22.040]   Yeah.
[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.400]   Yeah, I hate that.
[00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.000]   I'm a liberal.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.320]   It's OK.
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.240]   The real L word.
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.800]   And some--
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.600]   At some point, Facebook--
[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:33.800]   Do liberals kiss each other?
[00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:34.840]   Because I'd like to see that.
[00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:35.800]   That's hot.
[00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.800]   Only air crisis.
[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:39.760]   I'm sorry.
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:40.400]   Go ahead.
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:41.400]   Only you, Leo.
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:42.400]   Only you.
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:42.920]   I know.
[00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:43.560]   I'm sorry.
[00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.120]   I went there tonight.
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.040]   I'm so sorry.
[00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:48.040]   My apologies.
[00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:49.040]   Because I like you.
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.040]   I know.
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.320]   She fits up with a lot.
[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:51.680]   You're usually a points, Leo.
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:52.880]   We're all wearing black.
[00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:54.240]   That's just what I say.
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.160]   So he said-- oh, no, I forgot where I was.
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:58.440]   That's what we all for a little--
[00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.400]   [LAUGHS]
[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:02.440]   Jack, help me.
[00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:03.240]   What was I saying?
[00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.440]   What was he talking about?
[00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.320]   How I remember his progressive--
[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:07.000]   All right, right.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.200]   So it cut out because he tended to look
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:13.280]   at his progressive friend stuff more,
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.800]   his newsfeed started cutting out the conservative friend.
[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.520]   And he saw this as a horrible thing where they were living in him.
[00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:24.720]   Well, that's not the point is he was only reading the liberals.
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:25.560]   Right.
[00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.880]   This is the thing.
[00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:29.760]   You have to, as an adult, as a thinking human,
[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:33.080]   you have to follow people and read news sources
[00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:34.560]   with lots of different viewpoints.
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:38.000]   I mean, this is kind of on you as a thinking person to do.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:38.760]   So it depends.
[00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:41.360]   I mean, if you only look at the same people
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:42.640]   who are just echoing the same things,
[00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:43.840]   I mean, if you're following good writers,
[00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.360]   they're presenting opposite viewpoints as well.
[00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:46.840]   Sorry, Jeff.
[00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:48.000]   I didn't mean a hijack, but--
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:49.040]   No, you did it all.
[00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:50.880]   You were-- I was done.
[00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:54.160]   Well, and I think Jeff makes it really the best point of all,
[00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.720]   which is no matter what, we're getting a lot more
[00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:58.160]   inputs than ever before.
[00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.280]   We're getting exposed to far more stuff.
[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:03.040]   Even if you follow only liberal writers on Twitter,
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:07.280]   you're going to still see a lot of contrarian points of view
[00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:07.800]   and so forth.
[00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:08.320]   Exactly.
[00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:09.720]   You see the arguments that they're making.
[00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:10.760]   You see the links.
[00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:15.440]   We have more of an ethic of linking to that with which we disagree.
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:16.000]   Yes.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.920]   And if you don't do that, that's a sin in our world.
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:20.960]   And you certainly don't want to go back to the battle days.
[00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:24.880]   We're a handful of elderly white men controlled mainstream media.
[00:07:24.880 --> 00:07:25.760]   I mean, that's it.
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:27.160]   I mean, it's they still do.
[00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:27.880]   But at least we don't--
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.640]   As we talk about the moment one of whom, for just this reason,
[00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:36.160]   doesn't understand Twitter and is what he's upset about,
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:37.720]   Bill Keller or The New York Times will get to the morning
[00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:39.160]   and saying, but just starting on this,
[00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.240]   is that we are distracted.
[00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:43.480]   Twitter distracts us from what he tells.
[00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:43.960]   Yeah.
[00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:45.600]   Listen to me.
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:46.120]   Exactly.
[00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:48.720]   Pay no attention to those other guys.
[00:07:48.720 --> 00:07:50.840]   There's too much noise.
[00:07:50.840 --> 00:07:51.720]   Right.
[00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:54.160]   That's the whole media problem.
[00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:57.320]   Is that media took over the voice of the people
[00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:00.040]   and the people are now getting the voice back.
[00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:03.760]   And we're no longer all watching one media window in the world.
[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:08.080]   We are creating our own worlds across borders, across boundaries.
[00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:11.520]   We gleeks hang together and do a group hug.
[00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:13.120]   And we could do that.
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:16.120]   I always think of the fact that what we kind of accept
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:18.480]   as a given, which is the mass media,
[00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:20.560]   is really a modern invention.
[00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:23.640]   I mean, it's no more than a couple of hundred years old,
[00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:25.400]   if even that.
[00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:30.680]   And pre-mass media talk about hyper-local.
[00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:33.680]   You would know everything about your neighbors.
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:35.400]   Nothing about the rest of the world.
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:36.920]   Exactly.
[00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:38.800]   I'm going to do "Happermoss" twice in one show.
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:41.440]   And that's a-- I should get shot for that.
[00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:43.160]   But "Happermoss" the driven philosopher who
[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:46.440]   says that the public sphere started in the 18th century
[00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:48.320]   when what he said was the whole world
[00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:51.760]   was in fact a very small group of male property owners
[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:54.520]   and such had discussions in coffee houses.
[00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:58.200]   It was the first time he argues that they became a counterweight
[00:08:58.200 --> 00:08:59.680]   to the state.
[00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:02.840]   But then he laments that mass media came along and ruined it.
[00:09:02.840 --> 00:09:04.880]   His mass media now spoke to us.
[00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:06.280]   Now, I actually think that "Happermoss"
[00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:09.640]   ruined the concept because before his view,
[00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:12.280]   when we had the beginnings of the press and art--
[00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:14.160]   I'm talking about my book now--
[00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:16.680]   we were able to use tools to create new publics,
[00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:20.000]   many publics, publics of all various sorts and kinds.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.080]   And when he and media put us into a mass,
[00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:26.480]   that was a terrible period as far as I'm concerned.
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:27.680]   And we're breaking free of that.
[00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:28.520]   That's what I--
[00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:30.240]   We're still viewing the world in these old terms.
[00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:30.760]   Right.
[00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:32.320]   That's exactly what I think.
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:35.440]   And by the way, this will be on the final.
[00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:37.640]   Make sure you're taking notes, kids.
[00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:38.680]   I mean, it's not perfect.
[00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:40.400]   Nobody's saying it's a perfect solution.
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:41.960]   There are all sorts of issues.
[00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:44.080]   And filter bubbles, we should be aware of that
[00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:45.920]   as a potential issue.
[00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:47.920]   But I think you make the point, Gina, give people
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:53.600]   some responsibility to break out of whatever filter bubbles
[00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:56.760]   they may have created because a thinking, mature,
[00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:59.960]   grown-up seeks out other points of view.
[00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:02.320]   I mean, I follow all my family members on Facebook.
[00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:06.320]   That gives me all sorts of different points of view.
[00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:09.280]   I can't escape the other points of view.
[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:10.120]   Sorry, Daniel.
[00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:10.640]   That's true.
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:12.920]   They all say this name the same way.
[00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:16.240]   Trap any, japani, troupe any, trumpet--
[00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:18.560]   Japani, japani.
[00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:20.520]   Yeah, and I do that, actually, Gina.
[00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:24.400]   I will intentionally, as long as I can, watch Fox News.
[00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:25.880]   That I will.
[00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:27.120]   But I go that far.
[00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:28.200]   Well, that might be going a little far.
[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:30.000]   Oh, boy, we're going to hear from the--
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:30.440]   Oh, sorry.
[00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:31.680]   Our conservative viewers.
[00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:32.200]   Sorry.
[00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:36.280]   No, but I do actually try to follow conservative--
[00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:38.080]   commentators.
[00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:40.680]   I've got Carl Rov on my Twitter feed.
[00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:44.400]   And I watch Fox News because if you don't watch Fox News,
[00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:47.080]   you don't know what that part of the world is talking about.
[00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:48.440]   You don't know how to respond to it.
[00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:53.560]   You're being purposely ignorant about a part of the electorate.
[00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:55.480]   I have an alternative to watch Fox News.
[00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:56.360]   Yes.
[00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:57.440]   They do that for you.
[00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:58.840]   So you don't have to.
[00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:00.320]   And then we could be, yes.
[00:11:00.320 --> 00:11:03.720]   It's the way I bond with my father.
[00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:06.440]   Well, actually, if you watch a lot of MSNBC,
[00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:08.520]   pretty soon you do need something a little anodine
[00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:12.720]   to cleanse the palate, shall we say.
[00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:13.800]   No, OK, good.
[00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:15.280]   I'm glad we brought that up because I've
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:18.360]   been seeing a lot of links to this TED talk,
[00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:20.160]   the notion of filter bubbles.
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:22.360]   And I think it's a legitimate thing to be concerned about.
[00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:25.000]   And people should be aware that it's
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.240]   important to craft your sources so you hear from a variety of people.
[00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:31.480]   And where he's very right--
[00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:33.800]   and I haven't read the book yet--
[00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:35.960]   but where he's very right, I think,
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:39.600]   is that we in technology tend to not
[00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:45.640]   see how algorithms and such do have a prejudice and do effect.
[00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:48.880]   It's the same argument that other people like, I think,
[00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:51.200]   Lessick and Shurkey make about games.
[00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:54.240]   That games rules are a form of law.
[00:11:54.240 --> 00:11:57.400]   And they have an influence then on how the world behaves.
[00:11:57.400 --> 00:12:00.840]   So how the algorithm operates does indeed have a prejudice.
[00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:05.320]   And you can have valid algorithms that give you
[00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:08.320]   less valuable information than you could otherwise get.
[00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:09.760]   So I don't disagree with that.
[00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:11.880]   But the notion that we were better before,
[00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:15.400]   I think, is just curmudgeonly as hell.
[00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:17.760]   There's also the issue of the fact
[00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:20.480]   that Google is collecting information about your searches,
[00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:22.200]   that Facebook knows about your searches.
[00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:22.960]   And this--
[00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:23.640]   No, really?
[00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:24.200]   Yeah, really?
[00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:26.120]   Surprise.
[00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:28.360]   Web history and so forth.
[00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:30.400]   And you can turn that off.
[00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:36.640]   The Harris Interactive poll talked to 2,124 US adults
[00:12:36.640 --> 00:12:41.080]   and asked them if they agreed or disagreed
[00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:43.360]   that there's such an art to phrasing poll questions.
[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:44.560]   Oh, boy, is there.
[00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:47.320]   Yes, there is.
[00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:52.480]   Do you agree or disagree with this question?
[00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:54.680]   Google, Facebook, and others control
[00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:56.880]   too much of our personal information
[00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:00.840]   and know too much about our browsing habits.
[00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:02.640]   How could you disagree with that?
[00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:05.840]   76% agreed with it.
[00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:10.080]   36% of those strongly agreed with it.
[00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:16.400]   16%-- a mere 16% said they didn't think
[00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:18.600]   internet companies know too much about us.
[00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:21.000]   Is that how many employees Google has now?
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.560]   16% of the population.
[00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:26.120]   8% said, huh?
[00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:28.160]   So the headline is, if you give someone information,
[00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:29.160]   they have it.
[00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:33.320]   Facebook and Google know too much about us.
[00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:34.200]   Bingo.
[00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:36.720]   What is too much?
[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:38.360]   This whole story is just frustrating.
[00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:40.360]   Yeah, I wish Harris had said, well,
[00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:42.840]   did you tell Facebook that you were
[00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:47.520]   in a complicated relationship that you lived in--
[00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:50.280]   Muncie, Indiana, that you have 2.5 children?
[00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:52.040]   Did you tell them that?
[00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:53.720]   And now you're upset that they know that?
[00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:56.080]   I don't understand.
[00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:57.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:59.000]   No, I didn't tell Facebook that.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.120]   I told my friends that.
[00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:03.760]   It's going to lead to stupid legislation.
[00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:06.560]   The Do Not Track stuff is now taking off again,
[00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:10.920]   where in the UK is now going to implement opt-in
[00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:12.280]   because of an EU regulation.
[00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:12.760]   Yeah.
[00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:13.840]   We're heading down the thing that's
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:15.160]   going to kill the business.
[00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:16.840]   It's really a problem.
[00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:19.600]   And there's a really stupid law being
[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:21.880]   proposed in the California Senate, which I think
[00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:23.200]   is on the list nearly out.
[00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:24.320]   Oh, let's talk about it.
[00:14:24.320 --> 00:14:25.200]   I don't know.
[00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:26.440]   Here I am in California.
[00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:31.160]   It's the-- you call it the num-nuts privacy law.
[00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:33.480]   Is that the official term?
[00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:34.480]   The num-nuts law.
[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:37.040]   The DOT is the adjectival form.
[00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:42.800]   If this can't possibly pass, but I would not put anything
[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:46.880]   past the California legislature, these guys are clueless,
[00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:49.600]   to say the least.
[00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:51.320]   So what are they proposing?
[00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:52.400]   I was hoping you were going to get it.
[00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:52.880]   I'll read it.
[00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:53.760]   You want me to read it?
[00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:54.520]   It's your story.
[00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:56.120]   I hate to read your story.
[00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:56.600]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:56.920]   All right.
[00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:58.280]   I'm going to load this from all--
[00:14:58.280 --> 00:14:59.280]   Does aid dictation.
[00:14:59.280 --> 00:15:02.000]   You know, it's OK.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.040]   Do they-- I don't watch.
[00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:04.280]   Do they do that on dictation?
[00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:04.800]   Oh, yeah.
[00:15:04.800 --> 00:15:05.960]   They each have their stories.
[00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:08.640]   They say this is-- Alex will say that's my story, Kevin.
[00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:11.560]   I'm sitting in the doctor's waiting room reading
[00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:14.920]   a article about Kevin Rose, and I'm thinking.
[00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:15.800]   We're in a lot of--
[00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:17.720]   Where did I go wrong?
[00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:20.240]   No, it's like for venture capitalist-- venture capitalist
[00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:22.080]   Kevin Rose, who I remember as being
[00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:25.720]   like the kid who fixed the computers.
[00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:26.800]   It's like--
[00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:31.400]   He was an early investor in Zinga, and I'm going, oh, yay, yay.
[00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:33.000]   You did everything right, Leo.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   Yes.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.600]   I wasn't-- I'm not an early investor in Zinga.
[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:39.640]   Web giants, Facebook, Google, and Twitter, and Skype
[00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:43.360]   have banded together to oppose an online social networking
[00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:48.040]   privacy bill in California that will require users' permission
[00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:51.560]   to display personal information, such as home addresses.
[00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:55.360]   And phone numbers, Senate Majority Leader Ellen M. Corbett
[00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:58.600]   from San Leandro, just up the road apiece,
[00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:00.880]   said it was originally aimed to protect miners.
[00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:06.800]   She said then that Facebook and other companies argued
[00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:11.800]   the focus on youth would encourage people to lie about their age.
[00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:14.760]   So she said, well, all right, we'll just say everybody.
[00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:16.760]   We'll amend the bill to focus on everybody.
[00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:17.400]   It's all right.
[00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:22.000]   And you have to fax, what's that, mail or email,
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:25.640]   specific permission to put any personally identifiable
[00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:27.080]   information up.
[00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:28.320]   So if you think about this, this is--
[00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:28.680]   Wait a minute.
[00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:31.360]   --shifts the default to private.
[00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:35.080]   So Flickr would never exist.
[00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:37.720]   So in other words, if I wanted to put my home address
[00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:41.760]   on a Facebook page, I'd have to fax them permission.
[00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:43.600]   Yes.
[00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:46.320]   I mean, just the fact that the word fax is mentioned
[00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:51.320]   that I completely invalidates any--
[00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:53.480]   Oh.
[00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:55.800]   The bill would also allow parents to request any personal
[00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:57.840]   identifying information about the children on the age of 18
[00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:00.200]   to be removed within 48 hours.
[00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:02.160]   That seems, I guess, OK.
[00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:04.760]   Well, but that's--
[00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:07.200]   COPA has caused problems up to age 13.
[00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:09.640]   Dana Boyd would say that we're putting too much protection
[00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:10.560]   on our youth.
[00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:13.680]   We don't allow them to be online and have their identities
[00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:14.160]   or anything else.
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:16.280]   It means that there's no such thing as the 13-year-old online
[00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:17.880]   every child who's 14 at birth.
[00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:18.920]   Right.
[00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:22.160]   So we now extend that to 18, basically, is what that says.
[00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:24.000]   The bill passed a Senate committee,
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.480]   but it has not yet gone before the full Senate.
[00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:28.960]   And then, of course, the full legislature.
[00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:31.200]   And then, of course, the governor.
[00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:34.200]   I don't even know who the governor of California is anymore.
[00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:37.040]   I just found out it's not Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:39.200]   Well, we now have an heir to the throne, at least,
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:40.800]   the whole new one.
[00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:43.880]   Then he'll show us an egg.
[00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:46.520]   Jeff, would this really mean that Flickr couldn't exist?
[00:17:46.520 --> 00:17:48.440]   Well, Flickr defaults to public.
[00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:48.960]   Right.
[00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:49.480]   So what she has--
[00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:50.480]   Right.
[00:17:50.480 --> 00:17:53.200]   --is defaulting everything to private.
[00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:54.160]   That's what happens.
[00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:56.320]   You're going to get in trouble if you just automatically
[00:17:56.320 --> 00:17:57.400]   share with the world the thing.
[00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:58.800]   So it turns it into a closed world.
[00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:00.920]   But it only says name address--
[00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:07.320]   I read another story that had any PII.
[00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:08.840]   Any person may have a full question.
[00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:09.120]   Any PII.
[00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:11.080]   So that would include a photo of yourself.
[00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:13.120]   And name anything is what I'd read.
[00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:14.440]   All right, well, let's look at it.
[00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:16.280]   I got the bill right here.
[00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:16.640]   OK.
[00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:21.880]   SB 242 by Senator Corbin.
[00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:23.040]   Amen, amen, amen, amen, amen, amen, amen.
[00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:24.360]   Existing law requirement.
[00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:25.880]   But even so, it's still stupid.
[00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:27.680]   If you want to put your address up on Facebook,
[00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:29.280]   you have to give permission for Facebook
[00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:32.880]   to do what you just told Facebook to do.
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:35.320]   Bill would prohibit a social networking site
[00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:37.240]   from displaying in the designated text field
[00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:40.120]   to the public or other registered users, the home address
[00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:42.400]   or telephone number of a registered user of the internet.
[00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:49.160]   It's just home address and phone number.
[00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:51.200]   Social network shall not establish-- oh, here you go.
[00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:52.480]   This is the one.
[00:18:52.480 --> 00:18:56.800]   So in section part 2.7, section 60A,
[00:18:56.800 --> 00:18:59.920]   a social networking internet website--
[00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:03.960]   whatever that is-- shall-- I guess that's anything, right?
[00:19:03.960 --> 00:19:05.120]   I mean, do they define this?
[00:19:05.120 --> 00:19:07.040]   Except the New York Times.
[00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:09.720]   "shall establish a default privacy setting
[00:19:09.720 --> 00:19:12.760]   for registered users of the site that prohibits the display
[00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:17.960]   to the public or other registered users of any information
[00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:20.440]   about a registered user other than the user's name
[00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:24.520]   and city of residence without the agreement of the user.
[00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:29.720]   And the agreement of the user has to be done explicitly,
[00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:34.320]   as you mentioned, with fax email letter.
[00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:36.800]   You now see that it falls under the rubric--
[00:19:36.800 --> 00:19:39.840]   your honor of num-nuts."
[00:19:39.840 --> 00:19:42.040]   "The internet website shall not complete the process
[00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:44.760]   of registering a new user until privacy settings are selected
[00:19:44.760 --> 00:19:46.320]   by the user.
[00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:48.800]   All privacy settings available to all users of the internet
[00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:52.400]   website in a conspicuous place, easy to use format."
[00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:53.960]   Oh, I just-- what, you know.
[00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:55.080]   It's like-- I don't know.
[00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:56.920]   Yeah, OK.
[00:19:56.920 --> 00:20:00.000]   So this is basically to combat someone on Facebook
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.960]   publishing information about their friends
[00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:03.600]   and associating with their friends' profile
[00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:06.680]   without that person's ascent.
[00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:11.320]   Oh, well, no, it prevents you from doing it yourself.
[00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:14.200]   Oh, here's the definition of a social networking website.
[00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:17.280]   An internet web-based service that allows an individual
[00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:20.200]   to construct a public or partly public profile
[00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:22.800]   within a bounded system.
[00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:26.000]   What the hell does that mean?
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:26.440]   Wow.
[00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:30.320]   And the fine is $10,000 for each violation.
[00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:33.520]   Well, I hope it doesn't pass, but it is pretty--
[00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:34.800]   And here's the other issue.
[00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:37.240]   Even though I know I'm just being chicken level here.
[00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:38.400]   But let's say it passes.
[00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:39.760]   Let's say it becomes law in California
[00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:41.920]   because, hey, crazier things have happened.
[00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:42.280]   Not your own.
[00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:43.440]   Oh, yeah.
[00:20:43.440 --> 00:20:45.040]   Oh, it could happen.
[00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:46.920]   So what does that do then to the rest of America
[00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:48.080]   and the rest of the world?
[00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:48.580]   Right.
[00:20:48.580 --> 00:20:49.080]   That's the problem.
[00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:50.840]   Facebook operates here.
[00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:54.560]   It becomes the high watermark of regulation.
[00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:57.760]   Are you of the opinion that, OK, well, where do you--
[00:20:57.760 --> 00:20:59.280]   where if you could regulate the internet,
[00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:00.240]   where would you regulate?
[00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:01.920]   Obviously, not at the state or local level.
[00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:04.000]   It is a federal level enough because the internet's
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:04.680]   international.
[00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:06.960]   Do you have to have an international court regulated?
[00:21:06.960 --> 00:21:09.200]   Or just can you not regulate it at all?
[00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:09.600]   You don't.
[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:10.880]   That neutrality is neutrality.
[00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:11.960]   You cannot regulate the internet.
[00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:14.800]   And you can regulate behaviors.
[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:19.960]   You can regulate-- you can say that if you steal from somebody
[00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:22.960]   and you use the internet to do it or the mail to do it or--
[00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:24.360]   Anything is specifically internet.
[00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:25.960]   So child pornography is child pornography,
[00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:27.880]   whether it's on the net or in a book.
[00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:28.400]   It's illegal.
[00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:29.840]   It's illegal or illegal anywhere.
[00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:30.360]   Right.
[00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:31.960]   Well, that's the exact problem.
[00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:34.640]   When the terribly tragic case of Tyler Clemente,
[00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:36.560]   the young man at Rutgers University,
[00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:39.560]   who was spied upon allegedly by his roommate,
[00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:40.600]   and then jumped off--
[00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:41.400]   So sad.
[00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:42.600]   Bridge.
[00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:44.720]   Horrible, horrible moment.
[00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:48.280]   But the argument-- I went on--
[00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:50.480]   Katie Kerr kind of debated me on the air
[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:51.840]   the one time I've been on the show.
[00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:54.480]   This is a teachable moment about the internet.
[00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:56.800]   I kept saying, no, it's a teachable moment about life.
[00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:57.280]   Right.
[00:21:57.280 --> 00:21:58.240]   Yeah.
[00:21:58.240 --> 00:21:59.160]   That's not--
[00:21:59.160 --> 00:22:01.360]   That could have happened through a Kodak camera
[00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:03.840]   or a wisp diary sitting on the desk.
[00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:04.400]   Right.
[00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:07.920]   And so the problem is we're now demonizing the internet.
[00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:10.440]   And technology is if it causes these problems.
[00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:12.280]   The truth about the Tyler Clemente case
[00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:13.920]   is the fact that in this day and age,
[00:22:13.920 --> 00:22:16.960]   if any young person thinks that being discovered as gay
[00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:18.800]   is the reason that you should go kill yourself
[00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:19.680]   is not his problem.
[00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:21.800]   It is society's problem that we got that far.
[00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:23.560]   And that's the real story.
[00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:24.880]   We don't blame technology for that.
[00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:27.400]   We blame friggin society.
[00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:29.920]   End of server.
[00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:30.960]   Thank you, Tha.
[00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:32.280]   Yes.
[00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:33.040]   And you're right on.
[00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:35.960]   And we've been-- and Gina and I both say, yes, sir.
[00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:36.480]   Yeah.
[00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:38.560]   And the story had nothing to do with how Tyler was
[00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:39.560]   able to connect with others.
[00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:42.160]   And like 18s in general are able to connect with one another
[00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:44.080]   and find community and find connection
[00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:46.720]   at one of the most horrible times in your life,
[00:22:46.720 --> 00:22:47.920]   which is coming out.
[00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:49.200]   It wasn't about it gets better, right?
[00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:50.680]   It was about the web--
[00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:51.560]   The internet.
[00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:54.120]   Let's people find out stuff about you.
[00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:55.520]   Right.
[00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:57.360]   You know, although I wonder sometimes,
[00:22:57.360 --> 00:23:03.520]   Jeff, if you and I are so abnormal that we are not--
[00:23:03.520 --> 00:23:05.200]   because you and I both-- and I don't know if it's
[00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:07.960]   because we're kind of pathetic exhibitionists
[00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:09.840]   or we're a new breed.
[00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:12.720]   We're a new breed of open people.
[00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:16.120]   But our default is very, very public.
[00:23:16.120 --> 00:23:16.440]   It is.
[00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:18.480]   And I think that that comes--
[00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:20.160]   You tell me.
[00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:22.240]   But I think that I didn't necessarily
[00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:23.120]   start life that way.
[00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:24.880]   I didn't have the means to be that way, right?
[00:23:24.880 --> 00:23:27.960]   And only because blogs did we get the means to do this
[00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:29.560]   and the other tools that follow.
[00:23:29.560 --> 00:23:31.760]   And then having done it and pushed the envelope,
[00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:34.040]   I found no harm.
[00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:37.240]   So neither of you have been harassed, stalked--
[00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:39.160]   No, I've been stalked.
[00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:42.240]   Yeah, I've had bozos come after me in various ways.
[00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:43.080]   Yeah.
[00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:44.560]   But I was stalked not because of the internet.
[00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:47.000]   I was stalked because I was a radio post.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   Well, OK.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.360]   And so the internet's a platform for becoming well known,
[00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:50.860]   right?
[00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:51.360]   Well known--
[00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:53.880]   Right, but I've been public since I was 20
[00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:56.000]   because I've always been a broadcaster.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.360]   And--
[00:23:57.360 --> 00:23:59.400]   But have you ever truly felt threatened?
[00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:01.240]   But yeah, this woman had a knife.
[00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:03.240]   But--
[00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:04.040]   OK.
[00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:05.120]   I feel threatened by that.
[00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:06.560]   Yeah.
[00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:08.880]   And so did that make you question whether or not
[00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:11.760]   publishing or whereabouts would make you a good idea?
[00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:13.240]   No.
[00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:17.040]   This is a very good question.
[00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:17.480]   I mean--
[00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:19.720]   I think-- and I'd love to hear what Jeff says.
[00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:23.040]   But I think I've received so much benefit
[00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:26.920]   from living in public that it outweighs the risk, the very
[00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:31.800]   real risk, but in my opinion, low risk that it presents.
[00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:32.320]   So--
[00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:35.040]   And I think that there are ways to be public safely, like not
[00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:36.840]   use 4-square to check in when you arrive,
[00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:38.960]   but use it to check in when you leave, that kind of thing.
[00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:40.360]   Although I don't care.
[00:24:40.360 --> 00:24:42.600]   But I am a guy that's a very important point.
[00:24:42.600 --> 00:24:43.360]   Well, it's very important.
[00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:45.040]   Yeah, I'm a kind of hefty guy.
[00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:46.840]   But you have a wife and daughter, right?
[00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:50.240]   Well, and this is where it came up for me is in--
[00:24:50.240 --> 00:24:53.040]   obviously, they have to make that decision for themselves.
[00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:54.200]   Abby actually is pretty public.
[00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:56.440]   She has a Quora page--
[00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:59.000]   or not Quora, the other one-- form spring page,
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:00.120]   where she answers a lot of questions.
[00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:01.960]   She has a Twitter site.
[00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:03.360]   She's fairly public.
[00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:05.240]   She did a podcast for us.
[00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:06.640]   Jennifer does not want to be public,
[00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:08.320]   so you won't see many pictures of her,
[00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:10.200]   although then she gets mad at me, because there's no pictures
[00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:11.200]   for her.
[00:25:11.200 --> 00:25:13.280]   It's like, are you shaming me?
[00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:16.720]   I said, no, you don't want any pictures of you.
[00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:19.960]   But so I respect that, although I have to admit,
[00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:22.160]   it's hard for me, and I'm kind of proud of my kids,
[00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:23.160]   and I want to--
[00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:24.160]   No.
[00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:26.560]   And Henry, when he was pretty young,
[00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:28.240]   said tweet my cell phone number.
[00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:30.240]   I want to get some texts.
[00:25:30.240 --> 00:25:30.760]   Wow.
[00:25:30.760 --> 00:25:32.200]   And I did.
[00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:32.720]   Wow.
[00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:34.880]   And it was kind of funny, because his phone--
[00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:35.240]   Blue up.
[00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:36.480]   --was vibrating so much.
[00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:39.560]   It went off the table, and then we put it on the table,
[00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:40.480]   and it went--
[00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:42.040]   right off the table again.
[00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:43.520]   And he thought it was great.
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:48.040]   He probably does like being public.
[00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:48.480]   So--
[00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:49.200]   But it is risky.
[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:49.880]   I understand it's risky.
[00:25:49.880 --> 00:25:51.600]   It's more risky for women.
[00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:52.560]   More risky.
[00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:53.320]   I mean--
[00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:54.400]   And everybody has to be--
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:54.920]   People with respect issues.
[00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:57.960]   --people with things that are attacked.
[00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:01.360]   But Jean, I think you're absolutely right to raise this.
[00:26:01.360 --> 00:26:05.560]   And I'm not at all against looking at what bad could happen.
[00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:08.280]   But what I argue about the curmudgeons
[00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:10.200]   is that they want to manage--
[00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:15.040]   this legislation manages around only the worst that could happen.
[00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:17.400]   And if that's what we do, we're all in caves.
[00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:19.200]   We miss out on the benefit.
[00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:20.040]   Yes.
[00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:21.400]   I agree with you.
[00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:22.800]   I agree that the benefit outweighs the risks
[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:23.800]   that the way I'm doing the show.
[00:26:23.800 --> 00:26:24.240]   That's why I--
[00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:25.280]   --you know, it's all about the blog--
[00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:25.800]   We do live in the public.
[00:26:25.800 --> 00:26:27.360]   --the kind of thing.
[00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:29.000]   But I can see--
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.320]   you hear the stories about people who--
[00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:32.640]   Well, Kathy Sierra is a good example.
[00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:34.520]   Yeah, Kathy Sierra is a great example.
[00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:35.600]   I mean, that is--
[00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:36.400]   that's some scary stuff.
[00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:38.160]   That would make me want to go into a cave too, right?
[00:26:38.160 --> 00:26:39.360]   I think it's important not to.
[00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:43.240]   And I have some of my own experience with it.
[00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:44.200]   And it's hard.
[00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:46.280]   It's hard to-- it's a constant weighing
[00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:47.800]   of the benefits versus the risks.
[00:26:47.800 --> 00:26:49.280]   The benefits certainly do outweigh the risks.
[00:26:49.280 --> 00:26:50.400]   You control how you--
[00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:51.120]   I mean--
[00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:51.320]   Yes.
[00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:52.840]   --and you protect yourself.
[00:26:52.840 --> 00:26:54.840]   I do.
[00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:55.400]   --as much as I can.
[00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:57.560]   So you are public in a safe--
[00:26:57.560 --> 00:26:59.600]   what you deem to be a safe way.
[00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:02.480]   Yeah, there were those situations where a friend casually
[00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:05.920]   mentions something publicly that we had done together.
[00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:07.640]   There are times when you can't control--
[00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:08.160]   That does happen.
[00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:09.400]   --all the things that gets published about you, right?
[00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:10.760]   That does happen, yeah.
[00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:14.200]   So maybe my friends don't realize how
[00:27:14.200 --> 00:27:16.920]   that I'm trying to not publish pictures of my wife
[00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:20.240]   or not mention exactly where I live or that kind of thing.
[00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:22.720]   So I think that's why-- and I'm just playing devil's advocate
[00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:24.200]   because I really do agree with you guys.
[00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:27.040]   But I think this is where this kind of legislation comes up.
[00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:28.280]   Well, that's-- you're right.
[00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:30.040]   And that's where we need rules--
[00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:30.840]   societal rules.
[00:27:30.840 --> 00:27:32.200]   We need to have this conversation.
[00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:35.760]   And it needs to become an expected societal custom
[00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:39.440]   that you don't out somebody else.
[00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:39.920]   Right.
[00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:42.320]   Everybody's privacy is their own.
[00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:43.400]   And I had to learn that.
[00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:44.880]   I mean, I'm not that way.
[00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:50.760]   And so with my family, I really had to learn not to say stuff.
[00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:53.240]   But Jeff gets so much out of his blog posts
[00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:54.640]   about prostate cancer and so forth.
[00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:55.840]   But you know, you remind me I should
[00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:56.480]   have put this in the book.
[00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:57.000]   I forgot about this.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.120]   But I remember once when I was in San Francisco
[00:27:59.120 --> 00:27:59.840]   and I was a columnist.
[00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:01.040]   So same thing.
[00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:04.960]   At age 23, I was public on a way that I had to--
[00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:06.040]   You had a byline.
[00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:06.520]   Yeah.
[00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:08.760]   I had a byline and a little picture the size of my nose.
[00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:15.200]   And so I remember going out on a kind of date.
[00:28:15.200 --> 00:28:17.080]   Kind of date because that's what my social life was like.
[00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:19.200]   I've had a few of those too.
[00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:21.840]   Here I was, a straight guy in San Francisco.
[00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:25.320]   You think I would have had the various time with her.
[00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:27.280]   Anyway, so I was out in kind of a date with her
[00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:29.640]   and mentioned the column went to this movie.
[00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:31.160]   And I thought the same thing with Jennifer.
[00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:35.240]   I thought she'd be in solidarity if I didn't say that she said
[00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:35.880]   something.
[00:28:35.880 --> 00:28:37.120]   She got really mad at me.
[00:28:37.120 --> 00:28:38.720]   Why did you drag me into your column?
[00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:39.240]   Yeah.
[00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:39.720]   She was right.
[00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:41.000]   She was absolutely right.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.160]   Big lesson learned.
[00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:43.320]   You don't drag others in.
[00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:46.640]   You don't drag others in.
[00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:48.680]   Gina, you've changed your settings.
[00:28:48.680 --> 00:28:49.680]   Sorry.
[00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:50.920]   I don't know what's going on.
[00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:52.680]   It should be better now.
[00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:54.000]   You are much.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.400]   Well, some tech trouble here.
[00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:55.920]   Sorry.
[00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:57.720]   No, that's fine.
[00:28:57.720 --> 00:28:59.880]   But so it's good for us as this conversation.
[00:28:59.880 --> 00:29:01.680]   It's not good for us to legislate.
[00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:02.960]   Well, but here's the key thing.
[00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:06.520]   The sane discussion that we're having right now
[00:29:06.520 --> 00:29:08.880]   about bad things that could happen,
[00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:10.320]   how serious is the risk?
[00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:11.360]   What do you do about it?
[00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:12.600]   Can you protect against them?
[00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:13.560]   Can you educate people?
[00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:17.360]   That's all 100% absolute legitimate.
[00:29:17.360 --> 00:29:18.960]   That's not the way the discussion's being held.
[00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:20.840]   So Gina is playing devil's advocate.
[00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:23.120]   We need to discuss both sides of this.
[00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:24.680]   That's absolutely sane and right.
[00:29:24.680 --> 00:29:25.640]   What are the risks?
[00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:26.560]   The risk is the exchange.
[00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:26.840]   Right.
[00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:29.040]   What's never what's never rooted about.
[00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:30.480]   I'm glad you're writing a book on it.
[00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:32.280]   Is what are the rewards?
[00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:33.200]   That's the whole thing.
[00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:35.320]   Because very few of us live this way.
[00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:37.160]   This is not a typical way to live.
[00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:38.080]   No, it's not.
[00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:40.200]   The most people say, oh, that's--
[00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:40.600]   what?
[00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:42.080]   Why would I want to do that?
[00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:45.800]   And so I think it's good to talk about the amazing rewards
[00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:47.320]   of living in public.
[00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:50.280]   For one thing, I feel--
[00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:55.600]   I live in a community of viewers and listeners
[00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:58.480]   that are incredibly valuable and supportive to me.
[00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:02.080]   And I wouldn't have that if I hadn't put myself out there.
[00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:03.120]   I really found a tree.
[00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:05.400]   And the whole prostate cancer thing,
[00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:08.360]   well, I said a lot.
[00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:11.080]   I really only had one guy who attacked me.
[00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:12.280]   And he didn't like me anyway.
[00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:13.120]   Why would he attack you?
[00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:13.640]   He was just goose.
[00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:15.400]   You have prostate cancer.
[00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:17.120]   Why would somebody attack you?
[00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:18.400]   But he found--
[00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:20.200]   he was trying to make another point.
[00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:21.200]   I write about it in the book.
[00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:22.200]   It's a guy named Mark Derry.
[00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:23.040]   He can't stand me.
[00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:24.400]   Never could.
[00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:26.640]   But he uses the larger point to say
[00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:30.560]   that we're all becoming a blogger-reach and saying too much.
[00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:32.240]   Well, I find that to be an odd thing
[00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:34.240]   that he decides what's too much.
[00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:35.520]   Yeah, good point.
[00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:37.520]   The whole notion of oversharing.
[00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:40.400]   Well, who's to say that that's oversharing?
[00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:43.160]   Now, at the same time, I can acknowledge that I can certainly--
[00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:45.680]   it's very easy to get really boring and tell people things
[00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:46.800]   they don't want to know.
[00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:48.960]   But they're not compelled to follow you.
[00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:49.920]   Exactly.
[00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:50.360]   Exactly.
[00:30:50.360 --> 00:30:51.920]   So for them to say that I'm oversharing
[00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:53.240]   is a way to restrict my speech.
[00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:54.560]   And I never like that.
[00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:56.440]   Oh, I thought that's a good point.
[00:30:56.440 --> 00:31:00.120]   So then, in effect, this law here is--
[00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:01.760]   well, you can't say it's an abridgement of speech,
[00:31:01.760 --> 00:31:05.880]   because it's a law for commercial entities to protect people.
[00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:07.200]   I'm not sure.
[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:08.920]   Why is this law dangerous?
[00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:11.040]   By the way, we've lost Jean, and we'll get her back.
[00:31:11.040 --> 00:31:12.720]   She's probably not good at it.
[00:31:12.720 --> 00:31:13.880]   I'm a filibuster.
[00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:14.880]   I don't know what the heck.
[00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:16.720]   Fillerbuster, it's your turn.
[00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:17.600]   No, it's always my turn.
[00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:18.720]   I take too far too many turns.
[00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:19.400]   No, we love it.
[00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:21.560]   No, these are great subjects.
[00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:22.760]   You know, why is it dangerous?
[00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:25.680]   I think it's dangerous because of the unintended consequences,
[00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:29.880]   because a lawyer would say to the Flickr founders,
[00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:30.960]   what they found it.
[00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:32.600]   You really shouldn't do that.
[00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:34.800]   You better default everything to private.
[00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:36.840]   And then it would have been just another little photo
[00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:38.960]   service where we would have shared our little photos
[00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:42.000]   with other people who never would have gotten anywhere.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:44.560]   And because the effort that goes into-- well,
[00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:47.920]   the legislator would say, well, no, you can do it.
[00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:50.200]   You just have to get facts.
[00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:51.520]   Well, it's not going to be worth it.
[00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:54.040]   It's not worth building, tackling.
[00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:55.960]   And look at the wonderful, amazing things that
[00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:56.720]   came out of Twitter.
[00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:58.400]   Look at what we can share in the way.
[00:31:58.400 --> 00:32:03.880]   What if we-- if Twitter had to get a facts from us,
[00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:06.360]   so it's OK for me to say where I am right.
[00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:12.320]   Or for the guy in "Terrear Square" in Cairo, who had his location
[00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:16.160]   on his tweet, oh, you can't publish that until you get him
[00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:17.440]   to fax you.
[00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:17.920]   Right.
[00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:19.080]   Exactly.
[00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:21.720]   And so I think that as always in these cases,
[00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:22.760]   it's unintended consequences.
[00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:24.280]   One thing I say in the book--
[00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:27.960]   and I go way overboard in drawing parallels
[00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:29.160]   to the Gutenberg age.
[00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:30.640]   People will make fun of me for it, but I don't care.
[00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:31.200]   I'm absolutely obsessed.
[00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:32.240]   I do it all the time, too.
[00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:32.880]   I agree with you.
[00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:33.880]   I'm obsessed.
[00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:36.240]   That's the last big information revolution.
[00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:39.720]   And it has an equal impact what we're going to have today.
[00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:43.440]   And the problem remains, this guy wrote a Rand study in 1996,
[00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:49.440]   which is very early in the web, saying that we shouldn't try
[00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:51.720]   to forestall the change that the net brings.
[00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:54.600]   And that those countries in Europe that did so with the press
[00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:57.040]   fell behind, in general, in bigger ways.
[00:32:57.040 --> 00:32:57.880]   Well, that's the risk.
[00:32:57.880 --> 00:32:58.640]   That's a good point.
[00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:00.840]   That's the larger risk.
[00:33:00.840 --> 00:33:03.280]   And it's cultural to-- I mean, go back to Bill Keller
[00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:05.760]   editor of "The New York Times" in his curmudgeonly piece
[00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:08.560]   for this "Sundays" magazine that's now online.
[00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:09.840]   That is pure Twitter bait.
[00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:12.120]   And we're all fallen for it, including me.
[00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:14.520]   But he just goes on about how Twitter
[00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:17.360]   distracts us from what he's saying to us.
[00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:19.200]   That it's not real conversation.
[00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:21.280]   Well, who's to say that he decrees that?
[00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:22.600]   That it's not real relationships.
[00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:24.160]   Will you bet it is?
[00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:27.600]   And I compared it in some tweets to Erasmus, who
[00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:30.520]   had the same exact reaction to books.
[00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:32.160]   If I may read just a moment's quotes.
[00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:34.000]   Oh, yes.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.320]   So Erasmus said, "To what corner of the world
[00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:40.440]   do they not fly these swarms of new books?"
[00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:42.240]   Books he said are hurtful to scholarship
[00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:44.000]   because it creates a glut.
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:47.720]   And even in good things, satiety is most harmful.
[00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:48.560]   That's right.
[00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:50.080]   Finally, the minds of men are, quote,
[00:33:50.080 --> 00:33:51.800]   "Flyty and curious if anything new
[00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:53.440]   would be distracted from," quote,
[00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:57.000]   "the study of old authors, old authors like Bill Keller."
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:57.640]   Yeah.
[00:33:57.640 --> 00:34:00.960]   So don't run anything new because nobody will read our crap.
[00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:02.240]   Yep.
[00:34:02.240 --> 00:34:05.360]   You know, that article struck me as the article we see
[00:34:05.360 --> 00:34:09.120]   from everybody who kind of just discovers Twitter.
[00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:10.600]   Yeah.
[00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:11.920]   It's almost embarrassing.
[00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:13.160]   He'll look back on this.
[00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:14.400]   I think in a couple of years ago.
[00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:15.560]   Oh, god, I can't.
[00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:15.920]   I was--
[00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:17.480]   Oh, I've got-- I've got to make-- I'm going to go find it.
[00:34:17.480 --> 00:34:19.160]   I have an exchange with him over blogs.
[00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:21.040]   I try to get him to invite bloggers into the New York
[00:34:21.040 --> 00:34:24.000]   Times and have bagels.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.840]   And let me see if I can find a book.
[00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:27.720]   He's the executive editor of the New York Times.
[00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:28.280]   He should see that.
[00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:30.040]   He's tweeted 20 times.
[00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:31.360]   Yeah, he's new to Twitter.
[00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:33.000]   So he thinks it's a bunch of people
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:34.920]   eating their sandwiches.
[00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:36.280]   I mean, it's-- I hear that every time
[00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:37.360]   when somebody gets new to Twitter.
[00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:38.880]   And then it takes them six months.
[00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:40.480]   But then they go, oh.
[00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:41.080]   Yep.
[00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:41.440]   And--
[00:34:41.440 --> 00:34:42.360]   Yeah, it happened to all of us.
[00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:43.240]   It happens to all of us.
[00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:44.440]   I had the same reaction.
[00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:47.080]   And it's just kind of sad to see him publish it.
[00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:49.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:51.280]   He'll feel bad about that later.
[00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:53.880]   He's an executive editor of the Times, right?
[00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:56.720]   I mean, he sometimes has made some--
[00:34:56.720 --> 00:34:58.960]   a lot of kind of efforts in social media.
[00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:01.920]   But this is truly the way he feels about it.
[00:35:01.920 --> 00:35:03.440]   It's just an uninformed opinion.
[00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:04.600]   And it's one-sided.
[00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:05.800]   I thought that-- you know, I thought--
[00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:07.400]   the thing that bothered me the most about the article
[00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:09.720]   is that I thought that there were seeds of valid points.
[00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:12.240]   It was just really one-sided and uninformed.
[00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:14.760]   I mean, this is obviously a person who hasn't, who hasn't.
[00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:15.680]   He just discovered it.
[00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:19.760]   Truly used these tools in a good way.
[00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:20.600]   I mean, you know--
[00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:23.040]   I wish somebody would just collate all of these articles,
[00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:24.880]   because there have been so many of them.
[00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:27.320]   And then just put them all together.
[00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:29.360]   Because they all say the same thing.
[00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:30.360]   You know?
[00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:31.200]   Yeah.
[00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:33.400]   I wouldn't recommend going to it now at all.
[00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:37.760]   But for those of you interested, if you go to buzzmachine.com/times,
[00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:39.920]   you'll find an exchange from March 2005.
[00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:43.440]   And we had basically the same exchange over email about blogs.
[00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:46.760]   And by the way, please ignore the spam links that are in there.
[00:35:46.760 --> 00:35:47.280]   I don't know.
[00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:48.080]   It's an old archive.
[00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:49.320]   I don't know how to get them out.
[00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:50.800]   Help!
[00:35:50.800 --> 00:35:52.960]   And it's way long and kind of ridiculous.
[00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:55.720]   But he was just kind of similarly this much he blogs in.
[00:35:55.720 --> 00:35:57.880]   And I think now he would not.
[00:35:57.880 --> 00:35:59.480]   Well, he would to some extent.
[00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:01.520]   But it's a pointless thing.
[00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:02.880]   It says the progress has come.
[00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:04.080]   Things have changed.
[00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:07.880]   And it goes back to bad things could happen.
[00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:09.320]   I don't like it.
[00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:10.240]   Exactly.
[00:36:10.240 --> 00:36:13.920]   You kids with your Twitter.
[00:36:13.920 --> 00:36:15.600]   Stop it.
[00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:16.880]   Yeah, how about you?
[00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:19.880]   Get out of my lawn.
[00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:22.880]   Oh, well.
[00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:24.480]   My memory is getting kind of bad, though.
[00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:26.560]   Yeah, well, we're all going to be there any minute now.
[00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:29.320]   So just, you know, let's be nice to the old farts.
[00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:30.280]   Because I think that.
[00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:33.080]   I always think, OK, so what, in 10 years,
[00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:37.120]   there's going to be something new, the pooper.
[00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:39.000]   And I'm going to go, I don't like it.
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:40.680]   I don't want to know when somebody's
[00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:42.240]   going to the bathroom.
[00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:46.440]   And it'll just be me being out of date.
[00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:48.040]   Actually, maybe not in that case.
[00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:48.960]   Well, that actually will.
[00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:51.240]   That's where you're more unusual than your publicness.
[00:36:51.240 --> 00:36:51.960]   I am.
[00:36:51.960 --> 00:36:55.680]   People our age who have this thirst for the change in the new.
[00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:57.200]   There's not a lot of us.
[00:36:57.200 --> 00:36:58.480]   Yeah.
[00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:01.040]   But that's what's keeping me young.
[00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:01.480]   Amen.
[00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:04.240]   I wouldn't trade that for the whole.
[00:37:04.240 --> 00:37:09.520]   It does Google News stink because MG Sigler, Sigler,
[00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:10.480]   said it's really bad.
[00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:11.200]   And everybody hates it.
[00:37:11.200 --> 00:37:12.040]   I use it every day.
[00:37:12.040 --> 00:37:12.840]   And I thought, well, what?
[00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:15.200]   I didn't realize Google News was that bad.
[00:37:15.200 --> 00:37:16.200]   I don't think it stinks.
[00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:16.960]   I use it.
[00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:17.920]   Is it a bad thing?
[00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:20.600]   Anyway, they're redesigning it a little bit.
[00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:27.480]   The newly expandable stories on Google News in the US
[00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:30.800]   release today gives you greater story diversity
[00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:33.440]   with less clutter.
[00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:34.480]   No more filter bubble.
[00:37:34.480 --> 00:37:35.920]   Well, maybe.
[00:37:35.920 --> 00:37:39.280]   You can expand the stories down.
[00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:44.040]   And you can do a flashy, fun mail slide side to side.
[00:37:44.040 --> 00:37:44.920]   That's pretty snazzy.
[00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:46.600]   I can't say I use Google News every day.
[00:37:46.600 --> 00:37:48.920]   But I do look at it occasionally.
[00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:50.360]   I don't know why.
[00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:52.520]   When I need tech news, when I need to see what the big tech
[00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:55.200]   news stories are, I just go to Google News.
[00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:56.600]   And I click the text.
[00:37:56.600 --> 00:37:59.280]   Texts say, oh, it is different, isn't it?
[00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:00.480]   Well, I certainly use it every week.
[00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:02.920]   I was using it furiously an hour ago.
[00:38:02.920 --> 00:38:03.360]   Right.
[00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:05.480]   That's how we find our stories, right?
[00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:06.320]   Yeah.
[00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:06.960]   Yeah.
[00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:08.560]   Now, see, this doesn't have the new features.
[00:38:08.560 --> 00:38:11.400]   It's only on the front page, I guess,
[00:38:11.400 --> 00:38:13.440]   that the new features are.
[00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:14.360]   Yeah, it does look that way.
[00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:15.520]   It's just a pitch.
[00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:16.640]   Yeah.
[00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:17.960]   It's cosmetic, mostly, right?
[00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:19.280]   Is it or no?
[00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:20.280]   I can't tell.
[00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:20.780]   I think so.
[00:38:20.780 --> 00:38:21.640]   I think one of the things that I read,
[00:38:21.640 --> 00:38:25.520]   I have not played with this, that the ability to restrict
[00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:28.360]   how many blogs it shows you and how it defines blogs.
[00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:30.200]   I remain unhappy with Google News.
[00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:32.760]   Boy, you think Arnold Schwarzenegger was the only story
[00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:34.600]   in the US.
[00:38:34.600 --> 00:38:36.320]   Holy cow.
[00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:36.520]   Right.
[00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:37.560]   He's the first.
[00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:39.880]   First, second, third, fourth, fifth.
[00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:41.200]   What the hell?
[00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:44.560]   Well, obviously, this is customized to you.
[00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:45.800]   So you must have--
[00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:46.800]   Ah!
[00:38:46.800 --> 00:38:48.600]   Ah, the filter bubble again.
[00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:49.640]   Yes.
[00:38:49.640 --> 00:38:52.040]   TMZ Live, your questions answered.
[00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:52.520]   Really?
[00:38:52.520 --> 00:38:53.920]   OK, maybe Google News does stick.
[00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:57.440]   That's the top story.
[00:38:57.440 --> 00:39:00.760]   The Tiffany top story.
[00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:01.560]   So that's not--
[00:39:01.560 --> 00:39:02.320]   Am I logged in?
[00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:03.240]   I am logged in.
[00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:04.400]   Let me look if I log out.
[00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:05.240]   I'm going to log out.
[00:39:05.240 --> 00:39:07.920]   What's the top story if I log out?
[00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:09.200]   Yeah, I've got the same thing.
[00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:09.720]   I've got the same thing.
[00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:10.560]   I've got top stories as well.
[00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:11.120]   Oh, man.
[00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:12.440]   They must know me better than I do.
[00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:15.320]   Yeah, even if I'm logged out.
[00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:17.360]   But of course, the number two story
[00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:20.080]   is the International Monetary Fund, guy.
[00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:20.840]   Sex scandal.
[00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:22.240]   Sex scandal.
[00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:24.280]   Then the third story US sanctions
[00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:25.720]   Syria for human rights abuses.
[00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:26.960]   That might really--
[00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:30.000]   you might want to move that one up a little.
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:31.120]   See, I don't have that as third.
[00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:34.080]   I have Gates as somebody in Pakistan knew about bin Laden.
[00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:34.800]   Me too.
[00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:36.440]   Oh, you guys are-- oh, yeah, that's because I logged out.
[00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:38.240]   Let me log back in.
[00:39:38.240 --> 00:39:39.000]   Maybe-- maybe--
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:41.800]   Fourth, for me, is Android Google Security Scare,
[00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:44.040]   which I have to believe is unusual for me.
[00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:44.800]   Yeah, you know what?
[00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:48.320]   When I log in, Gates is number three on mine too.
[00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:50.680]   I can't reveal because that might be telling you too much
[00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:52.000]   private information.
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:52.680]   Is it Glee?
[00:39:52.680 --> 00:39:53.880]   Come on, tell the truth.
[00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:55.920]   Is it Glee right on the top there?
[00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:58.720]   No, I'm just kidding.
[00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:01.920]   The fourth one is also the Android Security Scare for me.
[00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:03.400]   So it sounds like we have similar ones.
[00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:05.840]   Although, be honest, I don't look at Google News very often,
[00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:09.080]   but this has to be personalized to your search results, right?
[00:40:09.080 --> 00:40:10.840]   Well, you'd want that to be.
[00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:12.040]   You'd want it to be.
[00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:15.000]   So is that why the number one video on my Google News
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:20.440]   is Man Eats 250,000th Big Mac 39 years after his first?
[00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:21.480]   I like that story.
[00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:22.000]   Yeah.
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:23.760]   Or Russell Martin gets a panic here.
[00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:24.280]   It'll be about me.
[00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:26.440]   Manny Petty, I don't--
[00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:28.600]   Would I get that many burritos?
[00:40:28.600 --> 00:40:31.720]   Yeah, there should be a Chipotle video here.
[00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:33.240]   Yeah, I also have the Big Mac story.
[00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:34.240]   Do you?
[00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:35.760]   They must know something about it.
[00:40:35.760 --> 00:40:38.480]   See, now, here's the paranoia thing.
[00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:40.520]   An insurance company can then say,
[00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:42.120]   ah, you must be eating a lot of junk food.
[00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:42.920]   We're going to--
[00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:43.840]   D-N-I-D!
[00:40:43.840 --> 00:40:45.520]   Right.
[00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:47.480]   So the solution is single payer insurance.
[00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:49.280]   That's all.
[00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:50.480]   Moving on.
[00:40:50.480 --> 00:40:53.000]   See, my liberal bias snuck in.
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:55.600]   Moving on.
[00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:57.880]   Let's talk about the Android issue,
[00:40:57.880 --> 00:40:59.680]   because it's potentially a pretty big issue.
[00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:02.200]   Google says we've got to fix, but to get fixed,
[00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:04.040]   you've got to get the latest version of Android.
[00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:05.520]   Good luck with that.
[00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:07.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:08.920]   But before we talk about--
[00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:10.200]   you guys can moan in private.
[00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:12.280]   We're going to talk a little bit about Squarespace.com,
[00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:14.760]   the secret behind exceptional websites
[00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:19.240]   in our fine sponsor for this portion of this week in Google
[00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:20.120]   Show.
[00:41:20.120 --> 00:41:22.440]   I probably shouldn't say the this week in Google Show.
[00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:23.920]   That's too many of this.
[00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:27.360]   Squarespace.com/twig is the place to go to find out more
[00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:27.800]   about this.
[00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:31.120]   It's hosting plus the best darn software out there--
[00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:33.960]   not just for blogs, but for websites in general.
[00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:36.560]   If you're tired of wrestling with your content management
[00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:38.920]   system, wrestle no more.
[00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:40.600]   You get a great looking site, because you
[00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:43.680]   start with these incredible templates that each and every
[00:41:43.680 --> 00:41:46.120]   site looks unique, because it's so easy to customize
[00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:48.240]   with sliders and buttons.
[00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:50.000]   Of course, if you know CSS and JavaScript,
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:54.160]   the sky's the limit there, then makes it easy to post on
[00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:57.280]   your site with that incredible iPad or iPhone app.
[00:41:57.280 --> 00:41:58.360]   I wish they could get an Android one.
[00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:01.600]   I have to talk to Dana and Anthony and say, eh,
[00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:03.400]   Android version, Android version.
[00:42:03.400 --> 00:42:06.160]   Great stats, beautiful photo galleries.
[00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:07.920]   A lot of photographers use Squarespace,
[00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:10.440]   because it makes it so easy to post your portfolio.
[00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:13.040]   There's form building, data connection, collection, even
[00:42:13.040 --> 00:42:13.800]   forums.
[00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:15.720]   When I say data collection, by the way, I'm not saying
[00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:16.600]   like sneaky.
[00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:19.320]   I'm saying you could put forums on your site.
[00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:21.760]   No, no, not sneaky data.
[00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:22.840]   Really is nice.
[00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:23.800]   Try it free right now.
[00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:25.520]   Go to squarespace.com/twig.
[00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:27.160]   Click the green, try it free button.
[00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:29.240]   All you need to provide is a site name, a password,
[00:42:29.240 --> 00:42:30.320]   and an email address.
[00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:31.800]   No credit card or anything like that.
[00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:34.720]   For two weeks, you have a full run of the Squarespace
[00:42:34.720 --> 00:42:35.240]   software.
[00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:37.880]   Anything you can do, you could try.
[00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:40.320]   It's a great way to create a site for family or friends
[00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:42.240]   who don't know about the web or don't have a site.
[00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:46.080]   If you know if your friends have a business that isn't on the web,
[00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:47.080]   you got to explain to them.
[00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:49.720]   If you're not on the web, you don't exist.
[00:42:49.720 --> 00:42:52.480]   Create that site right now, squarespace.com/twig.
[00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:53.720]   You can create it for them.
[00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:54.440]   Hand over the keys.
[00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:55.760]   It's kind of fun.
[00:42:55.760 --> 00:42:56.840]   I know a number of people will do that.
[00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:58.480]   squarespace.com/twig.
[00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:04.400]   We thank you so much for their support of this week in Google.
[00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:13.480]   So security experts say that there is a massive flaw.
[00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:15.080]   Actually, there's a number of flaws here.
[00:43:15.080 --> 00:43:19.520]   Let's talk about the one that's on 97% of all Android phones
[00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:22.400]   that basically leak your credentials out in such a way
[00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:25.680]   leak a token out in such a way that people can get that token
[00:43:25.680 --> 00:43:28.680]   and then log into your Google accounts or Gmail
[00:43:28.680 --> 00:43:30.920]   and your calendar and contacts.
[00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:32.720]   This is similar to FireSheep, right?
[00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:33.720]   Yeah, it's FireSheep.
[00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:34.920]   It's a secure network.
[00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:37.280]   Someone can get a token or sniff that token
[00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:42.080]   and log in as you to calendar contacts and other Google
[00:43:42.080 --> 00:43:43.600]   and non-Google services, right?
[00:43:43.600 --> 00:43:44.920]   Yeah.
[00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:49.040]   I just don't understand why more attacks
[00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:55.000]   don't happen on smartphones because they're just sitting ducks.
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:56.000]   That's true.
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:57.000]   That's true.
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:58.800]   Yeah, I shouldn't mention it.
[00:43:58.800 --> 00:43:59.680]   Hack--
[00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:01.440]   They don't know, Jeff.
[00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:03.760]   They keep saying that it's a server-side fix on chat room
[00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:04.320]   and Twitter.
[00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:05.480]   Yeah, isn't that interesting?
[00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:09.600]   They fixed it everywhere, but Picasa.
[00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:13.280]   Until the server-side fixed, though, it only affected,
[00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:14.880]   I think, FroYo, right?
[00:44:14.880 --> 00:44:17.000]   So if you had Gingerbread, you weren't vulnerable.
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:21.360]   They did push a fix on other versions of Android as well.
[00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:25.480]   Any version of Android prior to 234 was susceptible.
[00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:27.600]   So they fixed it on the server-side.
[00:44:27.600 --> 00:44:28.880]   Which they kind of had to, right?
[00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:31.600]   Because getting out these new versions, as we know,
[00:44:31.600 --> 00:44:32.880]   that doesn't happen very quickly.
[00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:35.920]   And this is the kind of fix that needs to go out very quickly.
[00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:39.160]   So the good thing it was server-side.
[00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:42.040]   So yeah, it was basically fire sheep, huh?
[00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:43.920]   It was that fire sheep thing.
[00:44:43.920 --> 00:44:45.920]   It sounds similar, but they're saying
[00:44:45.920 --> 00:44:49.280]   that it was stored on the servers in an insecure way.
[00:44:49.280 --> 00:44:51.360]   And this is why the server-side fixed.
[00:44:51.360 --> 00:44:54.840]   So it may not be exactly the same as fire sheep,
[00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:57.360]   but it only happened on insecure.
[00:44:57.360 --> 00:44:58.920]   And I'm not really sure.
[00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:02.000]   A weak authentication API.
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:03.680]   OK.
[00:45:03.680 --> 00:45:06.000]   Google's API requests.
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:08.400]   See, it's funny, because I tried when fire sheep came out--
[00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:12.440]   this is the program-- the plugin for Firefox
[00:45:12.440 --> 00:45:14.160]   that lets you go to an open access spot
[00:45:14.160 --> 00:45:16.280]   and see who's on Twitter, who's on Facebook,
[00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:17.400]   and then impersonate them.
[00:45:17.400 --> 00:45:19.400]   Because you get their token.
[00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:20.840]   So you don't have to log in.
[00:45:20.840 --> 00:45:21.680]   It's just a cookie.
[00:45:21.680 --> 00:45:23.480]   And then you just use that and say,
[00:45:23.480 --> 00:45:24.400]   I'm in the same--
[00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:26.360]   piggyback on their session, basically.
[00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:27.720]   Right.
[00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:30.680]   So this is similar to that.
[00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:32.880]   Except that the API was insecure.
[00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:35.760]   So they could change the way they handle that token
[00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:36.680]   on the server-side.
[00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:39.120]   Google's API requests a token by sending a password
[00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:43.640]   and username encrypted via a clear connection.
[00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:46.120]   So the token that's coming back--
[00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:50.280]   your password's safe, but the token's coming back in plaintext.
[00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:50.760]   Right.
[00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:53.880]   So if I'm sitting on an open network,
[00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:56.360]   I could see the token float by and grab it.
[00:45:56.360 --> 00:45:57.760]   Right.
[00:45:57.760 --> 00:46:01.200]   So it's good temporarily while you're there.
[00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:02.880]   Well, that was kind of the issue.
[00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:06.880]   There's token lasted, I think, longer than one would like.
[00:46:06.880 --> 00:46:08.040]   Yeah, that's a good question.
[00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:09.280]   I wonder if you changed your password.
[00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:10.560]   You know, would it--
[00:46:10.560 --> 00:46:11.680]   No, that should change it.
[00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:12.840]   That should change it, right?
[00:46:12.840 --> 00:46:13.840]   That should change it.
[00:46:13.840 --> 00:46:16.400]   But still, you want to roll a special server-side
[00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:16.960]   without requiring--
[00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:19.000]   Tokens normally expire.
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:20.720]   Yeah.
[00:46:20.720 --> 00:46:22.200]   But they have expiration dates.
[00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:23.680]   You have to set the expiration date,
[00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:27.600]   and I don't know how they were set.
[00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:28.960]   This was the problem with Facebook
[00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:32.760]   that a couple of days ago, where there were some tokens
[00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:33.920]   that were never expired.
[00:46:33.920 --> 00:46:36.560]   Most Facebook tokens expired after two hours,
[00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:38.440]   but there were some tokens that never expired,
[00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:40.280]   and then that was further compounded by the fact
[00:46:40.280 --> 00:46:42.760]   that it was leaked in a clear URL
[00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:45.960]   that the third-party applications could send out.
[00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:50.560]   So another reason why it's really good
[00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:54.320]   that Google is going to standardize the operating system
[00:46:54.320 --> 00:46:56.960]   versions across the board, right?
[00:46:56.960 --> 00:46:57.680]   Yeah.
[00:46:57.680 --> 00:46:59.800]   Because if you got a lot of people on older versions
[00:46:59.800 --> 00:47:03.040]   of Android, fortunately, they could fix us on the server.
[00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:04.120]   So Leo, that's interesting.
[00:47:04.120 --> 00:47:07.160]   So let's imagine that there were a client-side
[00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:10.080]   flaw, a bad emergency flaw.
[00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:15.440]   The structure is not set up at all to do a broad release.
[00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:16.200]   It should be.
[00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:16.920]   It needs to be.
[00:47:16.920 --> 00:47:17.640]   You're right.
[00:47:17.640 --> 00:47:19.360]   It isn't, and it should be.
[00:47:19.360 --> 00:47:20.120]   Yeah.
[00:47:20.120 --> 00:47:22.920]   My understanding, and in this, I don't know if this is accurate,
[00:47:22.920 --> 00:47:24.400]   but I read something that said this.
[00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:25.880]   I don't even remember where, so I don't even know
[00:47:25.880 --> 00:47:28.240]   how to attribute this to, is that there
[00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:33.880]   are three levels of patches from the carrier.
[00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:37.720]   There is a security patch, which is free to the carrier.
[00:47:37.720 --> 00:47:39.880]   The carrier should push out right away.
[00:47:39.880 --> 00:47:41.960]   It's kind of transparent.
[00:47:41.960 --> 00:47:46.280]   There's a fix, a lesser important fix,
[00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:47.760]   and then there's a software upgrade.
[00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:50.640]   And the problem is that these Android version upgrades
[00:47:50.640 --> 00:47:56.520]   or software upgrades, which the handset manufacturers
[00:47:56.520 --> 00:47:58.520]   have to pay the carrier for.
[00:47:58.520 --> 00:47:59.240]   Is that right, Jean?
[00:47:59.240 --> 00:48:00.320]   Am I saying that right?
[00:48:00.320 --> 00:48:00.560]   Right.
[00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:01.040]   That's right.
[00:48:01.040 --> 00:48:04.040]   But security fixes, there is a mechanism for security fixes
[00:48:04.040 --> 00:48:05.040]   to go out.
[00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:05.560]   OK.
[00:48:05.560 --> 00:48:06.840]   Go to the register button.
[00:48:06.840 --> 00:48:07.440]   There is.
[00:48:07.440 --> 00:48:10.920]   And there's no charge for that, and it's kind of automatic.
[00:48:10.920 --> 00:48:13.080]   And so presumably, that wouldn't be too hard.
[00:48:13.080 --> 00:48:14.520]   OK.
[00:48:14.520 --> 00:48:15.320]   Never mind.
[00:48:15.320 --> 00:48:16.080]   Never mind.
[00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:17.720]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:48:17.720 --> 00:48:18.720]   All right.
[00:48:18.720 --> 00:48:20.720]   Anyway, well, we've let you know.
[00:48:20.720 --> 00:48:22.040]   Just be aware.
[00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:25.760]   What's the story with this, the blurred house?
[00:48:25.760 --> 00:48:27.720]   Mr. Blermany, Jeff Jarvis.
[00:48:27.720 --> 00:48:32.880]   So, as we know, Germans, what Numb Nuddy about the Google
[00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:36.480]   Street View, and they demanded 244,000 demanded there,
[00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:38.040]   their Pixel Ohm's Rect.
[00:48:38.040 --> 00:48:39.040]   I love saying that.
[00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:39.880]   I love that.
[00:48:39.880 --> 00:48:43.120]   To get their homes or businesses pixelated.
[00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:47.680]   And so a local hardware store used this as an opportunity
[00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:52.960]   to pixelate a house in real life.
[00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:56.960]   And use it as a--
[00:48:56.960 --> 00:48:57.960]   An ad?
[00:48:57.960 --> 00:48:58.960]   Is it an ad?
[00:48:58.960 --> 00:48:59.960]   Yeah, it's an ad.
[00:48:59.960 --> 00:49:00.960]   The house is an ad.
[00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:01.960]   Let's see.
[00:49:01.960 --> 00:49:02.960]   Is this in Germany?
[00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:03.960]   It's in Germany.
[00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:04.960]   The things in English, but don't worry about it.
[00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:07.440]   So it says that a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of everybody
[00:49:07.440 --> 00:49:10.280]   hated it, and then they go, and they, in a minute, you're
[00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:11.840]   going to see them--
[00:49:11.840 --> 00:49:16.320]   Over 250,000 people have opted to have their homes pixelated
[00:49:16.320 --> 00:49:18.320]   in Germany.
[00:49:18.320 --> 00:49:20.320]   That's why we call it Blurmany.
[00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:21.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:49:21.320 --> 00:49:22.320]   So they did this.
[00:49:22.320 --> 00:49:23.320]   They actually--
[00:49:23.320 --> 00:49:25.320]   They blurred the house in real life.
[00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:26.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:28.320]   So they went to the hardware store, Prof--
[00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:28.320]   Prof--
[00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:29.320]   Prof--
[00:49:29.320 --> 00:49:30.320]   Ernest.
[00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:31.320]   Prof--
[00:49:31.320 --> 00:49:32.320]   Prof--
[00:49:32.320 --> 00:49:33.320]   Prof--
[00:49:33.320 --> 00:49:34.320]   Prof--
[00:49:34.320 --> 00:49:35.320]   Prof--
[00:49:35.320 --> 00:49:36.320]   Prof--
[00:49:36.320 --> 00:49:39.320]   Ernest is the hardware store, and they went and they took a picture of
[00:49:39.320 --> 00:49:41.320]   the house, and they blurred it, and then they put that picture up
[00:49:41.320 --> 00:49:42.320]   over the house.
[00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:43.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:49:43.320 --> 00:49:44.320]   And they--
[00:49:44.320 --> 00:49:45.320]   Here they go.
[00:49:45.320 --> 00:49:45.320]   Here they do it.
[00:49:45.320 --> 00:49:46.320]   Ernest.
[00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:47.320]   Fix it up.
[00:49:47.320 --> 00:49:48.320]   That is funny.
[00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:49.320]   Great ad campaign.
[00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:51.320]   What a great ad campaign.
[00:49:51.320 --> 00:49:54.320]   People are looking at what's wrong with my-- is my vision?
[00:49:54.320 --> 00:49:55.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:49:55.320 --> 00:49:59.320]   There's something-- I guess people kind of know about Blurmany, so--
[00:49:59.320 --> 00:50:00.320]   Yeah.
[00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:02.320]   They kind of know what's going on.
[00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:03.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:50:03.320 --> 00:50:04.320]   I love it.
[00:50:04.320 --> 00:50:05.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:50:05.320 --> 00:50:06.320]   All right.
[00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:07.320]   A little commercial interlude.
[00:50:07.320 --> 00:50:08.320]   A little silly moment for--
[00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:09.320]   Prof--
[00:50:09.320 --> 00:50:10.320]   Ernest.
[00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:13.320]   Which is-- so that's a hardware store.
[00:50:13.320 --> 00:50:14.320]   I guess so, yeah.
[00:50:14.320 --> 00:50:18.320]   Stephen Hawking has a message for Google.
[00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:22.320]   Professor Hawking says, "Philosophy is dead."
[00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:24.320]   This was at the Zeitkite Conference.
[00:50:24.320 --> 00:50:27.320]   Which, by the way, let me just pull off here.
[00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:29.320]   What do we have to do?
[00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:31.320]   Create--
[00:50:31.320 --> 00:50:34.320]   sucky, brown-nosing shows.
[00:50:34.320 --> 00:50:37.320]   I don't mean sucky, but I was going to be obscene there.
[00:50:37.320 --> 00:50:38.320]   Stop myself.
[00:50:38.320 --> 00:50:43.320]   Brown-nosing shows and a book about Google, and get invited to
[00:50:43.320 --> 00:50:44.320]   the Frickin Zeitkite.
[00:50:44.320 --> 00:50:46.320]   Hey, you kiss your ass, Google.
[00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:47.320]   Let us in.
[00:50:47.320 --> 00:50:48.320]   Jesus.
[00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:49.320]   Well, it wasn't Hertfordshire.
[00:50:49.320 --> 00:50:51.320]   Well, I'm fine.
[00:50:51.320 --> 00:50:52.320]   You've got a Hertfordshire.
[00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:53.320]   I've heard it's lovely.
[00:50:53.320 --> 00:50:54.320]   Jeff travels.
[00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:55.320]   He travels.
[00:50:55.320 --> 00:50:56.320]   So what is the Zeitkite?
[00:50:56.320 --> 00:51:03.320]   I mean, I know what Google Zeitkite is, because they do that at the end of every year, like kind of a state of the universe, state of the search page.
[00:51:03.320 --> 00:51:04.320]   Right.
[00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:05.320]   What people are searching for?
[00:51:05.320 --> 00:51:07.320]   I-- I-- I-- I can then impress them.
[00:51:07.320 --> 00:51:11.320]   Karen-- Karen Wickery said in Twitter where I complained about this, I whined and moaned and--
[00:51:11.320 --> 00:51:12.320]   thatched.
[00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:15.320]   And she said that the-- the Algo is complicated.
[00:51:15.320 --> 00:51:16.320]   Oh, God.
[00:51:16.320 --> 00:51:18.320]   Blame the Algorithm.
[00:51:18.320 --> 00:51:21.320]   Oh, God, I hate that.
[00:51:21.320 --> 00:51:22.320]   The Algo is complicated.
[00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:25.320]   You just had this vision of some of the future.
[00:51:25.320 --> 00:51:26.320]   Why won't you marry me?
[00:51:26.320 --> 00:51:29.320]   Well, the Algo is complicated.
[00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:33.320]   That needs to be a new Facebook dropdown for relationships.
[00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:35.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:51:35.320 --> 00:51:36.320]   So-- so hockey was--
[00:51:36.320 --> 00:51:37.320]   So hockey was--
[00:51:37.320 --> 00:51:41.320]   I mean, which I think would be kind of-- kind of cool.
[00:51:41.320 --> 00:51:51.320]   He basically says that philosophy hasn't kept up with the fact-based world of things like physics, and it can't answer the questions the way that facts can.
[00:51:51.320 --> 00:51:52.320]   Well, you know--
[00:51:52.320 --> 00:51:53.320]   Science thing.
[00:51:53.320 --> 00:52:01.320]   I think that there is something even deeper here, which is that the value of facts has been devalued a little bit because facts are so widely available.
[00:52:01.320 --> 00:52:10.320]   And this came to me when I gave my father-in-law as a science teacher an iPad, and I showed him the elements thing, and I showed him some like Starwalk and stuff.
[00:52:10.320 --> 00:52:23.320]   They said, imagine if Copernicus, who spent most of his life building the telescopes that allowed him to make the observations to come up with, you know, the fact that the earth revolved around the sun.
[00:52:23.320 --> 00:52:33.320]   Imagine if he'd had all-- if he didn't have to build-- you know, the facts were there, and he could do a synthetic process just from, you know, all the information that had been gathered.
[00:52:33.320 --> 00:52:42.320]   The access to information changes the value of facts on the one hand, which in the old days were much more valuable because they were harder to get.
[00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:48.320]   And on the other hand, gives many more people an opportunity to synthesize and theorize.
[00:52:48.320 --> 00:52:51.320]   Not to go back to just Hoverbough's twice Gutenberg three times.
[00:52:51.320 --> 00:52:53.320]   We'll keep exploring.
[00:52:53.320 --> 00:52:55.320]   We'll keep exploring.
[00:52:55.320 --> 00:52:57.320]   That's it. We should have a spell word.
[00:52:57.320 --> 00:52:59.320]   I'm just doing it before the chat room does.
[00:52:59.320 --> 00:53:00.320]   Get the cameras off of there!
[00:53:00.320 --> 00:53:03.320]   I don't think they could spell "Hattermaus." I think you're safe.
[00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:05.320]   Who's everma?
[00:53:05.320 --> 00:53:08.320]   Wasn't it? Did anyone hear Facebook?
[00:53:08.320 --> 00:53:17.320]   So, Eisenstein points out that before the pre-impress, the scholars had to go to the books.
[00:53:17.320 --> 00:53:23.320]   If you wanted to be scholarly, you had to go town to town to town to find the books to get the knowledge,
[00:53:23.320 --> 00:53:25.320]   and the books kind of couldn't compare with each other.
[00:53:25.320 --> 00:53:26.320]   There's one copy here, one copy there.
[00:53:26.320 --> 00:53:28.320]   Books come along, changes life.
[00:53:28.320 --> 00:53:34.320]   Before pre-impress, you remembered things by creating rhymes and things.
[00:53:34.320 --> 00:53:37.320]   You didn't need to do that. You could look it up.
[00:53:37.320 --> 00:53:39.320]   So, life just changes. It's okay. I don't think it's bad.
[00:53:39.320 --> 00:53:42.320]   You know, I don't know that I'd buy Hawking's argument.
[00:53:42.320 --> 00:53:49.320]   There are some things that we don't have answers for, and so philosophers try to fill in that blank as best they can.
[00:53:49.320 --> 00:53:54.320]   And I'm always the case. We're never going to know everything.
[00:53:54.320 --> 00:53:59.320]   Speaking of which the Winklevoss twins have decided to appeal to the Supreme Court.
[00:53:59.320 --> 00:54:03.320]   (Laughter)
[00:54:03.320 --> 00:54:10.320]   You know, as much as we may have disagreed with the social networks portrayal of the facts
[00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:15.320]   around the birth of Facebook, I think they got the Winklevoss dead on.
[00:54:15.320 --> 00:54:17.320]   (Laughter)
[00:54:17.320 --> 00:54:21.320]   Because, you know, they go to Lawrence Summers and say,
[00:54:21.320 --> 00:54:27.320]   "He stole our idea!" and Lawrence Summers said, "You're a man of Harvard. Come up with another idea."
[00:54:27.320 --> 00:54:30.320]   And don't you want that to be the scene in the Supreme Court next?
[00:54:30.320 --> 00:54:31.320]   (Laughter)
[00:54:31.320 --> 00:54:33.320]   That's not cool, man. Just so we can make fun of it.
[00:54:33.320 --> 00:54:36.320]   It's just an idea. Come up with another one.
[00:54:36.320 --> 00:54:40.320]   You're right. Instead, they say, "No, but this was our idea!"
[00:54:40.320 --> 00:54:44.320]   And they already got what it was at $160 million, and that wasn't enough.
[00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:46.320]   I mean, this is the thing. Do you want your legacy to be?
[00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:50.320]   I spent all these years fighting over a couple of bucks about a stolen idea,
[00:54:50.320 --> 00:54:53.320]   because I didn't have another idea. I mean...
[00:54:53.320 --> 00:54:54.320]   (Laughter)
[00:54:54.320 --> 00:54:58.320]   I kind of enjoy this. I mean, I don't know what the Supreme Court will do,
[00:54:58.320 --> 00:55:02.320]   but I think it'd be great if they watched the movie and then just duplicate Larry Summers' response.
[00:55:02.320 --> 00:55:05.320]   Exactly. (Laughter)
[00:55:05.320 --> 00:55:07.320]   You're a man of Harvard.
[00:55:07.320 --> 00:55:09.320]   You know what's coming next?
[00:55:09.320 --> 00:55:14.320]   And actually, I would watch this in a flash, The Winkle by Reality Show.
[00:55:14.320 --> 00:55:16.320]   (Laughter)
[00:55:16.320 --> 00:55:18.320]   Let's follow the Winkle by Twins.
[00:55:18.320 --> 00:55:24.320]   Or The Winkle by Join Celebrity Apprentice. Now that would be great.
[00:55:24.320 --> 00:55:25.320]   That would be great.
[00:55:25.320 --> 00:55:32.320]   Yeah, you know what? Learn from the modern world and become a great celebrity.
[00:55:32.320 --> 00:55:35.320]   Don't continue this lawsuit.
[00:55:35.320 --> 00:55:37.320]   It's really interesting. They really feel...
[00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:42.320]   ...slided. They feel injured, obviously.
[00:55:42.320 --> 00:55:45.320]   They feel like they deserve more of the money.
[00:55:45.320 --> 00:55:49.320]   Yeah. They said, "Oh, Facebook lied to us. They were worth more."
[00:55:49.320 --> 00:55:54.320]   If we had known, we wouldn't have accepted $160 million.
[00:55:54.320 --> 00:55:57.320]   Well, but then, that's the irony. They didn't accept $160 million.
[00:55:57.320 --> 00:55:59.320]   It's something to $35 million.
[00:55:59.320 --> 00:56:01.320]   But it turned out to be a good management of Facebook.
[00:56:01.320 --> 00:56:03.320]   That is now worth $160 million.
[00:56:03.320 --> 00:56:07.320]   I somehow think that The Winkle by wouldn't manage it quite so well as Marques.
[00:56:07.320 --> 00:56:10.320]   Can you say "Hutzpah" in Harvard?
[00:56:10.320 --> 00:56:12.320]   "Hutzpah." They've got "Hutzpah."
[00:56:12.320 --> 00:56:14.320]   (Laughter)
[00:56:14.320 --> 00:56:17.320]   Those boys certainly have "Hutzpah."
[00:56:17.320 --> 00:56:22.320]   I see a word "sock puppetry," but I don't see a...
[00:56:22.320 --> 00:56:23.320]   (Laughter)
[00:56:23.320 --> 00:56:25.320]   Or just do we want to discuss the Facebook...
[00:56:25.320 --> 00:56:27.320]   I couldn't find one, believe it or not.
[00:56:27.320 --> 00:56:30.320]   The Facebook sock puppetry. Maybe the store may be too old now.
[00:56:30.320 --> 00:56:32.320]   What is it? I don't know.
[00:56:32.320 --> 00:56:34.320]   Facebook hired Bursam-Marcell or...
[00:56:34.320 --> 00:56:36.320]   We haven't talked about this.
[00:56:36.320 --> 00:56:38.320]   No, we haven't.
[00:56:38.320 --> 00:56:40.320]   Is this the term sock puppetry?
[00:56:40.320 --> 00:56:41.320]   Yeah.
[00:56:41.320 --> 00:56:43.320]   Because you're using somebody as a mouthpiece.
[00:56:43.320 --> 00:56:45.320]   So they hired a PR firm.
[00:56:45.320 --> 00:56:48.320]   Somebody at Facebook PR had a singularly bad idea.
[00:56:48.320 --> 00:56:50.320]   I think that's mostly what you can accuse them of.
[00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:53.320]   To hire a PR firm to plant stories on blogs,
[00:56:53.320 --> 00:56:57.320]   saying, "It's not Facebook. It's Google.
[00:56:57.320 --> 00:57:00.320]   Google's the privacy problem. Not us.
[00:57:00.320 --> 00:57:02.320]   I mean, not them.
[00:57:02.320 --> 00:57:05.320]   Facebook. I mean, Google."
[00:57:05.320 --> 00:57:07.320]   So I'm not a bad sock puppet.
[00:57:07.320 --> 00:57:10.320]   So what do you think?
[00:57:10.320 --> 00:57:15.320]   Does this mean that Facebook is fundamentally a morally corrupt company?
[00:57:15.320 --> 00:57:17.320]   (Laughter)
[00:57:17.320 --> 00:57:19.320]   I mean, I'm sorry.
[00:57:19.320 --> 00:57:22.320]   I can't even get a little stronger than I meant for it to be.
[00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:24.320]   But like, every time a story like this happens on Facebook,
[00:57:24.320 --> 00:57:26.320]   this isn't the first term that Facebook has done.
[00:57:26.320 --> 00:57:28.320]   You know, beak in the privacy stuff.
[00:57:28.320 --> 00:57:32.320]   I mean, it feels like there are times when Facebook is deliberately
[00:57:32.320 --> 00:57:36.320]   hiding things and doing evil.
[00:57:36.320 --> 00:57:38.320]   I don't know.
[00:57:38.320 --> 00:57:42.320]   Well, if they're owned by the CIA, I guess it's not a surprise.
[00:57:42.320 --> 00:57:44.320]   Well, the CIA also wants to sock puppet.
[00:57:44.320 --> 00:57:46.320]   They put out an RFP.
[00:57:46.320 --> 00:57:50.320]   The Army did a while ago to do a whole bunch of sock puppetry in Arab nations.
[00:57:50.320 --> 00:57:54.320]   It's just dumb because you know that somebody, which is what happens,
[00:57:54.320 --> 00:57:58.320]   some blog is going to say, "Hey, you won't believe what has happened.
[00:57:58.320 --> 00:58:01.320]   Facebook offered me 150 bucks to publish this article."
[00:58:01.320 --> 00:58:02.320]   Right.
[00:58:02.320 --> 00:58:05.320]   I mean, it was inevitable that they would get caught, so it's just stupid.
[00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:06.320]   It's more than a...
[00:58:06.320 --> 00:58:08.320]   It's just stupid.
[00:58:08.320 --> 00:58:11.320]   It just says these days, I love it because it goes to the book.
[00:58:11.320 --> 00:58:13.320]   It just says these days that if you don't stand up behind your name
[00:58:13.320 --> 00:58:15.320]   and say what you're saying, then you will be out.
[00:58:15.320 --> 00:58:16.320]   You'll be out again.
[00:58:16.320 --> 00:58:18.320]   I, for some reason, it doesn't bother me.
[00:58:18.320 --> 00:58:21.320]   It just seems like this is the kind of thing that goes on all the time, doesn't it?
[00:58:21.320 --> 00:58:22.320]   It doesn't? I mean...
[00:58:22.320 --> 00:58:23.320]   Am I being naive?
[00:58:23.320 --> 00:58:24.320]   Does this kind of thing go on all the time?
[00:58:24.320 --> 00:58:26.320]   Does everybody do this and they just got caught?
[00:58:26.320 --> 00:58:28.320]   It feels like doing this...
[00:58:28.320 --> 00:58:29.320]   Oh, yeah.
[00:58:29.320 --> 00:58:30.320]   It happens what PR companies do.
[00:58:30.320 --> 00:58:31.320]   That's what they do.
[00:58:31.320 --> 00:58:33.320]   I mean, they may not do it in such an egregious fashion.
[00:58:33.320 --> 00:58:35.320]   And what would Google do?
[00:58:35.320 --> 00:58:36.320]   Really bad.
[00:58:36.320 --> 00:58:37.320]   It is.
[00:58:37.320 --> 00:58:38.320]   It's pretty...
[00:58:38.320 --> 00:58:39.320]   It's creepy.
[00:58:39.320 --> 00:58:41.320]   I don't know if you're naive, Gina.
[00:58:41.320 --> 00:58:44.320]   I mean, it is definitely creepy, but I do feel like it's kind of...
[00:58:44.320 --> 00:58:45.320]   You are lobbying.
[00:58:45.320 --> 00:58:47.320]   It's kind of standard operating practice, right?
[00:58:47.320 --> 00:58:54.320]   All companies try to spread fun about the competition and they use a variety of tools to do it.
[00:58:54.320 --> 00:58:57.320]   And most of the time, they're trying to get the press.
[00:58:57.320 --> 00:58:59.320]   They're trying to get us.
[00:58:59.320 --> 00:59:00.320]   It's misdirection.
[00:59:00.320 --> 00:59:01.320]   Pay no attention.
[00:59:01.320 --> 00:59:03.320]   It's over there.
[00:59:03.320 --> 00:59:06.320]   And that's what PR people do.
[00:59:06.320 --> 00:59:07.320]   Sometimes they go, "Pay no attention.
[00:59:07.320 --> 00:59:08.320]   It's over here."
[00:59:08.320 --> 00:59:09.320]   But it's the same thing.
[00:59:09.320 --> 00:59:10.320]   Right.
[00:59:10.320 --> 00:59:14.320]   The interesting thing in this case, Gina, was that I'll back up and now quote my book.
[00:59:14.320 --> 00:59:15.320]   I'm being really obnoxious today.
[00:59:15.320 --> 00:59:16.320]   Please.
[00:59:16.320 --> 00:59:19.320]   What would Habermas say?
[00:59:19.320 --> 00:59:20.320]   I think...
[00:59:20.320 --> 00:59:24.320]   You should write that book.
[00:59:24.320 --> 00:59:28.320]   You'd say, "Pixulate my home."
[00:59:28.320 --> 00:59:33.320]   So I said that there were two professions that couldn't be Googly, Law and PR.
[00:59:33.320 --> 00:59:35.320]   Easy punchline.
[00:59:35.320 --> 00:59:39.320]   But also just said that the reason is they have clients and that they can't...
[00:59:39.320 --> 00:59:40.320]   They have to speak for the clients.
[00:59:40.320 --> 00:59:43.320]   They have to do the clients, but they have to take swords and the stomach for the client.
[00:59:43.320 --> 00:59:46.320]   What's interesting about this story is that as soon as this happened, Bursts Marcell or the
[00:59:46.320 --> 00:59:49.320]   PR company threw Facebook out of the box.
[00:59:49.320 --> 00:59:50.320]   Oh yeah.
[00:59:50.320 --> 00:59:53.320]   And said, "We never should have done this."
[00:59:53.320 --> 00:59:54.320]   Right.
[00:59:54.320 --> 00:59:57.320]   So what I wonder about that is, what's more dishonorable?
[00:59:57.320 --> 01:00:00.320]   Do we hit in the first place and then try to blame your client for it?
[01:00:00.320 --> 01:00:01.320]   No kidding.
[01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:02.320]   No kidding.
[01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:06.320]   And I think Bursts Marcell or comes across ten times worse even than Facebook.
[01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:08.320]   Don't they have a terrible reputation?
[01:00:08.320 --> 01:00:09.320]   That seems to me.
[01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:10.320]   Yeah.
[01:00:10.320 --> 01:00:11.320]   They're going to do a lot of political stuff.
[01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:12.320]   Because they didn't protect their client.
[01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:13.320]   They didn't take the hit.
[01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:14.320]   But they do.
[01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:16.120]   They work for some pretty...
[01:00:16.120 --> 01:00:18.320]   As I remember, some pretty nasty fellas.
[01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:21.320]   And who would have hired them now?
[01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:22.320]   Right.
[01:00:22.320 --> 01:00:25.320]   Yeah, because that's the problem with PR.
[01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:26.320]   Right.
[01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:30.320]   Bad PR doesn't mean no more clients.
[01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:34.320]   They are the world's fifth largest PR firm.
[01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:35.320]   Oh yeah.
[01:00:35.320 --> 01:00:36.320]   But they do.
[01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:42.160]   They represent, you know, governments and, you know, with poor, you know, you know, are
[01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:43.960]   human rights record.
[01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:45.440]   Isn't all that bad?
[01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:47.440]   Look at Facebook.
[01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:56.440]   The Nigerian government hired them to discredit reports of genocide during the Baffron War.
[01:00:56.440 --> 01:00:57.440]   Okay.
[01:00:57.440 --> 01:00:58.440]   Awesome.
[01:00:58.440 --> 01:00:59.440]   Okay.
[01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:06.080]   The Argentinian Hunta, after the disappearance of 35,000 civilians, who are you going to call?
[01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:08.160]   Bursts Marceller.
[01:01:08.160 --> 01:01:12.840]   The Indonesian government, after the massacres in East Timor.
[01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:18.880]   They also work to improve the image of Romanian president and funny man, Nikolai Chochescu,
[01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:22.000]   and the Saudi royal family.
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.600]   So I think at least the person at Facebook knew who to call.
[01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:26.720]   Well, that's a horrible thing too.
[01:01:26.720 --> 01:01:28.880]   They knew they were doing something sleazy in the back.
[01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:29.880]   Yeah.
[01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:30.880]   Sleazy company.
[01:01:30.880 --> 01:01:31.880]   You're going to call.
[01:01:31.880 --> 01:01:33.680]   I'm betting Burstson suggested it.
[01:01:33.680 --> 01:01:35.080]   Oh.
[01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:36.560]   You know what we could do.
[01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:37.560]   Right.
[01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:41.600]   You know, we did this before for the Nigerians.
[01:01:41.600 --> 01:01:43.600]   They loved it.
[01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:48.600]   They've also worked for Big Tobacco.
[01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:55.960]   You know, they, European biotech firms to counter Greenpeace arguments on genetically
[01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:57.600]   modified food.
[01:01:57.600 --> 01:01:58.600]   There's a whole website.
[01:01:58.600 --> 01:01:59.600]   I'm looking at it.
[01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:00.600]   Awesome.
[01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:01.600]   Awesome.
[01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:03.400]   This makes me really trust Facebook's choice.
[01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:05.240]   They went to these guys.
[01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:06.240]   Wow.
[01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:08.240]   This is a big thing.
[01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:09.240]   Oh, AIG.
[01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:11.680]   They're not trying to be good.
[01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:12.680]   No.
[01:02:12.680 --> 01:02:14.440]   No, because that's not fair.
[01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:20.600]   I've found trouble finding stuff on Google News, which means that they've cleverly managed
[01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:21.760]   to kind of bury this.
[01:02:21.760 --> 01:02:22.760]   Yeah.
[01:02:22.760 --> 01:02:30.480]   I mean, Gina's reaction is great because you're shocked, but it also is not around
[01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:31.480]   that much.
[01:02:31.480 --> 01:02:32.480]   We just we just on Earth to begin.
[01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:34.600]   She's so naive and honest.
[01:02:34.600 --> 01:02:35.600]   I mean, it just felt like another check.
[01:02:35.600 --> 01:02:37.240]   Like, of course, Facebook did this.
[01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:38.240]   Yes, it is.
[01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:41.640]   They have this kind of you really do have to look at kind of their track record over
[01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:42.800]   and over again.
[01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:47.240]   By the way, I think that one of the real disservices that the mainstream media, which
[01:02:47.240 --> 01:02:50.580]   spent a lot of time on sock puppetry did, and one of the reasons we didn't cover sock
[01:02:50.580 --> 01:02:56.400]   puppetry so thoroughly over the past week, is it distracted people from a much bigger
[01:02:56.400 --> 01:03:00.120]   issue to me, which is that Facebook was leaking people's profiles.
[01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:01.120]   Right.
[01:03:01.120 --> 01:03:05.920]   And, you know, I tweeted, I didn't tweet this story, I tweeted, change your password on
[01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:10.280]   Facebook because if you don't, you have the potential that all sorts of third parties
[01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:14.760]   have your profile information due to leaks.
[01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:15.760]   And that was kind of buried.
[01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:18.600]   And I think it's interesting the media, well, it's an easier story, right?
[01:03:18.600 --> 01:03:22.360]   It's the technology is complicated on the other stuff.
[01:03:22.360 --> 01:03:24.600]   And besides sock puppetry has a good name.
[01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:25.760]   It does.
[01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:31.200]   Do you think it's creepy that an Israeli couple named their baby like?
[01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:36.320]   Yeah, they might mean something in Hebrew that's not.
[01:03:36.320 --> 01:03:39.160]   Well, if you named it like because you liked the baby, that's okay.
[01:03:39.160 --> 01:03:42.480]   If you name it like after Facebook, that's creepy.
[01:03:42.480 --> 01:03:49.320]   As long as they don't tattoo a thumbs up on its rump, I think it's probably OK.
[01:03:49.320 --> 01:03:51.040]   Developers software creates culture.
[01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:57.080]   We had that story when the after the Egyptian spring that some Egyptian parent named their
[01:03:57.080 --> 01:03:58.640]   baby Facebook in Egyptian.
[01:03:58.640 --> 01:04:01.840]   And the problem is what's this kid's nickname going to be?
[01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:02.840]   This.
[01:04:02.840 --> 01:04:03.840]   This.
[01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:05.520]   Hey, this.
[01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:10.240]   I like it.
[01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:16.160]   I put I'm embarrassed to say I put a like button on my blog this week and a send button
[01:04:16.160 --> 01:04:18.120]   because it drives so much traffic you can't not do it.
[01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:22.920]   And now that Bing is incorporating this stuff, I mean, I don't know anybody uses Bing, but
[01:04:22.920 --> 01:04:25.000]   I presume somebody's using it.
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:26.000]   Yeah.
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:30.840]   Bing is now putting things your friends like higher in the search.
[01:04:30.840 --> 01:04:31.840]   Right.
[01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:34.920]   So if you know they just marked it now they're moving it up the front.
[01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:38.400]   So you're crazy if you're in it, by the way, this is another reason to hate Facebook.
[01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:42.720]   You're crazy if you're a website and you don't have a Facebook like button because you're
[01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:48.520]   in effect going to be you're going to be downgraded on Bing because you don't.
[01:04:48.520 --> 01:04:50.280]   Right.
[01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:54.520]   So it's important to, you know, now you have to play in this ecosystem.
[01:04:54.520 --> 01:04:57.960]   And this is really where Facebook, uh, Oh God, I need to redesign.
[01:04:57.960 --> 01:05:00.440]   So I'm so many years overdue redesigning my blog.
[01:05:00.440 --> 01:05:01.680]   I've got to get somebody to read.
[01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:04.960]   Well, I'm not suggesting you put a like, but make better decisions with the help of
[01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:05.960]   your friends.
[01:05:05.960 --> 01:05:06.960]   Learn more.
[01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:07.960]   Okay.
[01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:08.960]   Do I have to turn it on?
[01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:09.960]   Does it does it require me?
[01:05:09.960 --> 01:05:13.400]   That way it looks like you have to press this try social search now button.
[01:05:13.400 --> 01:05:15.200]   I haven't looked at Bing and ages.
[01:05:15.200 --> 01:05:17.600]   Try social search now.
[01:05:17.600 --> 01:05:20.520]   Maybe maybe this your big experience gets even better.
[01:05:20.520 --> 01:05:25.320]   Nice looking young Microsofty will explain this.
[01:05:25.320 --> 01:05:30.920]   By the way, it's got a like button on, on the explanation.
[01:05:30.920 --> 01:05:33.440]   Are these things are, I think this is the, the bane of the web.
[01:05:33.440 --> 01:05:34.440]   Just a moment.
[01:05:34.440 --> 01:05:37.280]   Oh, here she comes.
[01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:39.920]   Hey, Bing's a happy place.
[01:05:39.920 --> 01:05:41.920]   Where you can find things your friends like.
[01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:46.520]   Shopping with my friends, but sometimes they're not in the same city or they're in class or
[01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:48.320]   we really just can't get together in a store.
[01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:49.960]   So I'll do my shopping online.
[01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:52.160]   I'll actually head over to Bing shopping.
[01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:55.640]   And one of the great features that they have there is this thing called shopping lists by
[01:05:55.640 --> 01:05:56.640]   building a shopping list.
[01:05:56.640 --> 01:05:57.640]   No, sorry.
[01:05:57.640 --> 01:05:58.640]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:05:58.640 --> 01:05:59.640]   Okay.
[01:05:59.640 --> 01:06:02.640]   Now when I search for, let me search for something else.
[01:06:02.640 --> 01:06:05.400]   Let's search for a twig.
[01:06:05.400 --> 01:06:06.400]   You must have connected already.
[01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:07.400]   I did.
[01:06:07.400 --> 01:06:08.400]   I connect.
[01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:09.400]   Yeah.
[01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:10.400]   But not my friends.
[01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:11.400]   Apparently they'll like twigs.
[01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:12.920]   See, this is why I like button.
[01:06:12.920 --> 01:06:14.800]   I need a like button.
[01:06:14.800 --> 01:06:16.160]   Let's look at tech crunch.
[01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:18.040]   I don't click it that often.
[01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:19.680]   Yeah, click it more often.
[01:06:19.680 --> 01:06:22.840]   Look at what my friends like on tech crunch right here.
[01:06:22.840 --> 01:06:23.840]   MGC.
[01:06:23.840 --> 01:06:24.840]   What likes it?
[01:06:24.840 --> 01:06:26.840]   MGC is like in his own articles.
[01:06:26.840 --> 01:06:27.840]   He's like in his own articles.
[01:06:27.840 --> 01:06:30.040]   Well, there you go.
[01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:31.040]   Let's see.
[01:06:31.040 --> 01:06:32.040]   What does he say?
[01:06:32.040 --> 01:06:33.520]   He, by the way, MG notorious apple family.
[01:06:33.520 --> 01:06:37.600]   Why isn't Google Chrome a part of Android?
[01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:40.280]   Now to see if the social search stuff actually works.
[01:06:40.280 --> 01:06:45.280]   So actually I fell for his little honey pot.
[01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:46.280]   You did.
[01:06:46.280 --> 01:06:47.280]   I did.
[01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:48.280]   So now I'm losing my friend.
[01:06:48.280 --> 01:06:54.520]   That's, I guess this is why it's important that you cultivate the right friends.
[01:06:54.520 --> 01:06:55.920]   People who like things.
[01:06:55.920 --> 01:06:58.520]   People like you like people who like.
[01:06:58.520 --> 01:06:59.520]   So what do you think?
[01:06:59.520 --> 01:07:01.480]   I mean, I know, I mean, I think it's a bad idea.
[01:07:01.480 --> 01:07:02.480]   So let's take a break.
[01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:05.280]   We're going to come back with our do we have any other big stories that we don't want to
[01:07:05.280 --> 01:07:06.280]   miss?
[01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:07.280]   They canceled.
[01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:08.280]   My dad says show.
[01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:10.440]   It's funny, but it's not really the cloud.
[01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:11.320]   There's nothing to do with the cloud.
[01:07:11.320 --> 01:07:13.640]   The Google translate beatbox.
[01:07:13.640 --> 01:07:14.640]   It's funny for a minute.
[01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:15.640]   All right.
[01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:17.040]   That second video is pretty funny.
[01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:19.520]   Google translate the remix.
[01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:22.760]   When we built Google translate, we thought it was a cool tool we had to admit.
[01:07:22.760 --> 01:07:26.520]   We had fairly straightforward ideas about what it would be useful for.
[01:07:26.520 --> 01:07:29.520]   However, no, no.
[01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:33.480]   Here is a Google demo slam translate beatbox.
[01:07:33.480 --> 01:07:35.200]   Let's see what the.
[01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:40.680]   He's going to English to German.
[01:07:40.680 --> 01:07:50.160]   Isn't that great?
[01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:52.560]   He typed in a bunch of random.
[01:07:52.560 --> 01:07:53.560]   He did.
[01:07:53.560 --> 01:07:54.800]   That's pretty good.
[01:07:54.800 --> 01:07:56.320]   That second video is pretty good too.
[01:07:56.320 --> 01:07:59.360]   They like re-mixed a song based on in Chinese.
[01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:00.360]   All right.
[01:08:00.360 --> 01:08:01.360]   Let's see.
[01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:03.320]   This is a Google.
[01:08:03.320 --> 01:08:05.080]   Is this translate also?
[01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:06.080]   Yeah.
[01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:07.760]   Yeah, that's similar.
[01:08:07.760 --> 01:08:12.720]   So typing in something in English into the Chinese box.
[01:08:12.720 --> 01:08:14.520]   Google translation.
[01:08:14.520 --> 01:08:16.360]   This is a translation.
[01:08:16.360 --> 01:08:17.360]   Okay.
[01:08:17.360 --> 01:08:19.360]   That's in English.
[01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:25.680]   One, two, half a million views in Taiwan.
[01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:33.160]   It sounds like cropped work.
[01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:34.160]   Wow.
[01:08:34.160 --> 01:08:49.200]   I guess if you're reading the, if you speak Chinese and you read the Chinese and then see what the
[01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:52.280]   translation is, it's funny, right?
[01:08:52.280 --> 01:09:00.440]   It's pretty catchy.
[01:09:00.440 --> 01:09:02.600]   That's awesome, right?
[01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:09.320]   It's a military dog.
[01:09:09.320 --> 01:09:10.320]   Estimated dog.
[01:09:10.320 --> 01:09:12.320]   Estimated dog translation.
[01:09:12.320 --> 01:09:13.320]   Cheers.
[01:09:13.320 --> 01:09:14.320]   My translation.
[01:09:14.320 --> 01:09:19.480]   Oh, and it even talks about the beatbox.
[01:09:19.480 --> 01:09:28.120]   It's a Chinese beatbox.
[01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:30.120]   This is awesome.
[01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:33.720]   Like a whole new art form.
[01:09:33.720 --> 01:09:34.720]   Piano solo.
[01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:37.480]   Yeah, you know what?
[01:09:37.480 --> 01:09:38.480]   I like it.
[01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:39.480]   I like it.
[01:09:39.480 --> 01:09:40.480]   Here's the problem.
[01:09:40.480 --> 01:09:43.160]   It just proves we get no serendipity in life, you know?
[01:09:43.160 --> 01:09:44.160]   Right.
[01:09:44.160 --> 01:09:46.560]   Yeah, because I would, you know, I never found that.
[01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:47.560]   No, no, no, no.
[01:09:47.560 --> 01:09:48.560]   We'd never find that.
[01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:49.560]   Yeah.
[01:09:49.560 --> 01:09:50.560]   No, no, we didn't see that.
[01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:51.560]   Let's take a break.
[01:09:51.560 --> 01:09:52.560]   I don't read the same old stuff about English.
[01:09:52.560 --> 01:09:53.560]   It's all I do.
[01:09:53.560 --> 01:09:58.040]   I don't want to hear anything about beatboxes.
[01:09:58.040 --> 01:10:01.680]   Take that off of my whatever, stumble upon.
[01:10:01.680 --> 01:10:06.240]   I'm unlocking my iPad right now because I want to show you a new iPad app.
[01:10:06.240 --> 01:10:12.400]   Then we're going to get to your tip tool and number of the week with the new furniture
[01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:14.520]   is on its way to our new studio.
[01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:18.760]   I was watching the video, my friend, and I tweeted before that I want to quit my jobs
[01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:20.920]   and my life and come out there and move there.
[01:10:20.920 --> 01:10:23.040]   I'll set up a desk for both of you.
[01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:24.040]   It'd be great.
[01:10:24.040 --> 01:10:25.040]   Yeah, that new space looks awesome.
[01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:26.040]   It looks amazing, Leo.
[01:10:26.040 --> 01:10:27.040]   That's great.
[01:10:27.040 --> 01:10:28.040]   I'm so excited.
[01:10:28.040 --> 01:10:33.560]   We're awarded a furniture, so we made a product placement deal with restoration hardware.
[01:10:33.560 --> 01:10:35.360]   Do you know that?
[01:10:35.360 --> 01:10:36.360]   Great.
[01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:37.360]   Oh, yeah.
[01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:38.360]   Go to Well.
[01:10:38.360 --> 01:10:39.360]   I love that.
[01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:42.360]   I love hanging out at restoration hardware.
[01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:49.160]   They have now an iPhone, an iPod, an iPad app that is their whole catalog.
[01:10:49.160 --> 01:10:51.320]   I downloaded the catalog on here.
[01:10:51.320 --> 01:10:54.680]   This is how we actually figured out what we were going to get.
[01:10:54.680 --> 01:10:57.560]   This is their 384 page source book.
[01:10:57.560 --> 01:10:58.920]   I don't even get this in my mail.
[01:10:58.920 --> 01:11:00.720]   I get the little tiny one.
[01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:04.920]   But now you can get the whole source book here on your iPad.
[01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:06.760]   You can zoom in at stuff.
[01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:07.760]   I'll show you.
[01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:09.160]   Let me see if I can find some of the stuff we ordered.
[01:11:09.160 --> 01:11:10.800]   We wanted to go to the Captain Nemo route.
[01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:15.440]   It's kind of a retro.
[01:11:15.440 --> 01:11:17.680]   I want it to look like 20,000 leagues under the sea.
[01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:20.280]   A little steam funky, but not completely.
[01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:21.280]   Like this clock.
[01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:22.280]   Nice.
[01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:23.720]   Yeah, we ordered that clock.
[01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:24.720]   I love that clock.
[01:11:24.720 --> 01:11:25.720]   Go restoration hardware.
[01:11:25.720 --> 01:11:26.720]   Yeah.
[01:11:26.720 --> 01:11:29.160]   So see, I zoomed in on it.
[01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:30.520]   So that's in the mirror, though.
[01:11:30.520 --> 01:11:31.800]   It's backwards.
[01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:33.600]   But yeah, they did a nice job.
[01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:38.200]   I mean, I think you have to order when you click order, you go through the web.
[01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:39.200]   But this is really nice.
[01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:41.440]   And you can easily zoom in on what you want to read about.
[01:11:41.440 --> 01:11:43.000]   It shows you the page.
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.000]   That's because Apple would have gotten 70%.
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:47.040]   Oh, you're exactly right.
[01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:48.840]   That's exactly right.
[01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:49.840]   Sorry.
[01:11:49.840 --> 01:11:50.840]   They know you're right.
[01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:52.840]   They didn't want to do an app purchases.
[01:11:52.840 --> 01:11:53.840]   Now we've been changing the show.
[01:11:53.840 --> 01:11:54.840]   Now we've been changing the show.
[01:11:54.840 --> 01:11:56.520]   She's always looking for the evil motive.
[01:11:56.520 --> 01:11:57.600]   I think we got this one, too.
[01:11:57.600 --> 01:11:58.880]   We got a bunch of big clocks.
[01:11:58.880 --> 01:11:59.880]   I like those.
[01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:00.880]   Yeah.
[01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:01.880]   And some really cool furniture.
[01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:03.280]   They have this kind of airline.
[01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:05.320]   It looks like it's made like an airline wing.
[01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:07.080]   It's hammered aluminum.
[01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:09.760]   Anyway, we were looking at these chairs, but I just, I veated them.
[01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:11.680]   I think we got the table, though.
[01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:12.680]   I love that table.
[01:12:12.680 --> 01:12:14.840]   I think that's what we're going to use on the TNT set.
[01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:15.840]   And we got this bookshelf.
[01:12:15.840 --> 01:12:19.960]   Anyway, thank you, restoration hardware, for providing a whole bunch of beautiful furniture
[01:12:19.960 --> 01:12:20.960]   for a new set.
[01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:26.680]   In return, I'd like to invite you to check out their free iPad app 2.0 just came out.
[01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:30.840]   Restoration Hardware at Search for it on the iTunes App Store.
[01:12:30.840 --> 01:12:32.440]   Thank you, Restoration.
[01:12:32.440 --> 01:12:33.800]   Hardware.
[01:12:33.800 --> 01:12:34.800]   We love that.
[01:12:34.800 --> 01:12:35.800]   You know what?
[01:12:35.800 --> 01:12:36.960]   They have, it's in there for Christmas.
[01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:39.840]   I bought it by some of my, they have some good coffee table books about some Christmas
[01:12:39.840 --> 01:12:40.840]   presents there.
[01:12:40.840 --> 01:12:41.840]   Retro games.
[01:12:41.840 --> 01:12:42.840]   I love that.
[01:12:42.840 --> 01:12:43.840]   Nice.
[01:12:43.840 --> 01:12:47.440]   Let us go to Gina Trapani now for our tip of the week.
[01:12:47.440 --> 01:12:48.440]   Tip of the week.
[01:12:48.440 --> 01:12:49.440]   Spreadsheet nerds.
[01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:50.440]   Yay.
[01:12:50.440 --> 01:12:53.120]   Pivot tables in Google Docs.
[01:12:53.120 --> 01:12:54.120]   What?
[01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:55.120]   Pivot tables.
[01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:56.920]   That's the most sophisticated feature in Excel.
[01:12:56.920 --> 01:12:57.920]   They got it in Google Docs.
[01:12:57.920 --> 01:12:58.920]   They did.
[01:12:58.920 --> 01:12:59.920]   They did.
[01:12:59.920 --> 01:13:03.480]   I noticed it when I logged in to look at our rundown today and you'll see a little
[01:13:03.480 --> 01:13:06.400]   kind of pop-up box that say pivot tables are in.
[01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:12.360]   If they're in the data menu, it's you choose pivot table report.
[01:13:12.360 --> 01:13:15.560]   And obviously this works really well if you have a spreadsheet full of numbers.
[01:13:15.560 --> 01:13:17.240]   Yeah, we'll work on our show rundown.
[01:13:17.240 --> 01:13:19.360]   Yeah, it will really work on our rundown really well.
[01:13:19.360 --> 01:13:23.120]   This is really, this is a very powerful tool that it took me a long time to learn how
[01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:24.120]   to use in Excel.
[01:13:24.120 --> 01:13:25.120]   It is.
[01:13:25.120 --> 01:13:26.120]   It is one of those.
[01:13:26.120 --> 01:13:30.120]   So you go to that right, that right area and then you can define, you know, what columns
[01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:33.640]   you want to, you know, what rows and columns you want to add to the table.
[01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:37.880]   And yeah, and then you can generate charts based on your pivot table.
[01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:39.760]   I have to say, I love spreadsheets.
[01:13:39.760 --> 01:13:44.880]   I'm not a huge, I'm not a pivot table expert, but the video on the blog post that I have
[01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:48.440]   in the rundown there, trying to give you kind of an example of showing revenue over
[01:13:48.440 --> 01:13:50.720]   time from a sales report.
[01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:51.720]   So it's cool stuff.
[01:13:51.720 --> 01:13:58.200]   Yeah, it's probably non-intuitive to learn it, but highly worth putting the energy in
[01:13:58.200 --> 01:14:02.680]   because it's very powerful way to kind of massage data and look at it.
[01:14:02.680 --> 01:14:03.680]   Definitely cool.
[01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:04.680]   Cool.
[01:14:04.680 --> 01:14:07.080]   Yeah, cool docs going to give it got handed to them.
[01:14:07.080 --> 01:14:08.080]   There's always something new.
[01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:11.800]   I feel like whenever I log into Google Docs, I get a little notification about it.
[01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:12.800]   Yeah.
[01:14:12.800 --> 01:14:14.480]   I love the, we mentioned this before on Android.
[01:14:14.480 --> 01:14:16.720]   They now have a great Google Docs app.
[01:14:16.720 --> 01:14:17.720]   Yes.
[01:14:17.720 --> 01:14:20.520]   Which really makes it even more useful.
[01:14:20.520 --> 01:14:26.280]   Jeff Jarvis, your number of the week, 18% of Americans log into Facebook before their
[01:14:26.280 --> 01:14:28.120]   head leaves the pillow in the morning.
[01:14:28.120 --> 01:14:29.120]   Oh, crap.
[01:14:29.120 --> 01:14:31.480]   35% use some interactive, some application.
[01:14:31.480 --> 01:14:34.000]   Wait a minute, you're saying they're still lying down?
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:35.240]   Yes.
[01:14:35.240 --> 01:14:38.360]   And like before they get up, actually, I think I understand this.
[01:14:38.360 --> 01:14:40.160]   You grab the phone, you get the Facebook.
[01:14:40.160 --> 01:14:41.160]   Yeah.
[01:14:41.160 --> 01:14:42.160]   Yeah.
[01:14:42.160 --> 01:14:43.160]   Whoa.
[01:14:43.160 --> 01:14:44.160]   Okay.
[01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:45.160]   Get up now.
[01:14:45.160 --> 01:14:48.320]   It was a research conducted by Eric.
[01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:49.320]   Yeah.
[01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:50.320]   So it's fun.
[01:14:50.320 --> 01:14:51.320]   Yeah.
[01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:52.320]   Yeah.
[01:14:52.320 --> 01:14:53.320]   Wow.
[01:14:53.320 --> 01:14:55.720]   That is truly amazing.
[01:14:55.720 --> 01:14:57.000]   That's crazy.
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.800]   So I've been for my tool of the week.
[01:14:59.800 --> 01:15:02.280]   I've been playing an awful lot with the Samsung Galaxy tab.
[01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:08.720]   And while I admit that it needs a lot of work, I mean, I think I can't wait until 3.1 comes
[01:15:08.720 --> 01:15:09.720]   out.
[01:15:09.720 --> 01:15:12.680]   I wish it would come out soon.
[01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:15.680]   Because it crashes on me fairly frequently, it pauses and stuff.
[01:15:15.680 --> 01:15:17.440]   But I'm kind of growing.
[01:15:17.440 --> 01:15:18.440]   It's growing on me.
[01:15:18.440 --> 01:15:20.480]   You got some bad widgets happening there.
[01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:21.480]   Look at all the widget.
[01:15:21.480 --> 01:15:22.720]   I've been doing a lot of widget fine.
[01:15:22.720 --> 01:15:23.720]   There's the Google Docs widget.
[01:15:23.720 --> 01:15:24.720]   Oh, yeah.
[01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:25.720]   I'll just--
[01:15:25.720 --> 01:15:26.720]   You ever know?
[01:15:26.720 --> 01:15:27.720]   Here's Gmail.
[01:15:27.720 --> 01:15:28.720]   This is that what I talked about last week, grocery IQ.
[01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:32.960]   Because what I do now is I spend a lot of time looking for tablet apps.
[01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:33.960]   Yes.
[01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:36.120]   Because there aren't that many.
[01:15:36.120 --> 01:15:37.760]   There's only, I don't know, 100, 200.
[01:15:37.760 --> 01:15:38.760]   They're not that many.
[01:15:38.760 --> 01:15:39.760]   I found a couple that I like.
[01:15:39.760 --> 01:15:40.760]   I wanted to share with you.
[01:15:40.760 --> 01:15:42.360]   This is-- I love Hacker News.
[01:15:42.360 --> 01:15:43.600]   I read Hacker News religiously.
[01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:46.560]   This is kind of like a news reader for Hacker News.
[01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:47.800]   It crashes on me a little bit.
[01:15:47.800 --> 01:15:50.320]   It's H and-- yep, see it crashed.
[01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:51.320]   Oh.
[01:15:51.320 --> 01:15:52.320]   I know.
[01:15:52.320 --> 01:15:53.320]   That just did a force close.
[01:15:53.320 --> 01:15:54.960]   Let me see if I can launch it again.
[01:15:54.960 --> 01:15:55.960]   No.
[01:15:55.960 --> 01:15:57.800]   And I don't know if this is honeycomb or not.
[01:15:57.800 --> 01:16:01.440]   Because even my browser crashes a lot.
[01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:04.360]   But this is a great-- it's a great news reader.
[01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:05.960]   It worked for a long time.
[01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:08.520]   H Android, Hacker News Droid.
[01:16:08.520 --> 01:16:09.520]   But it's just Hacker News.
[01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:11.560]   But a great way-- I've always looked for a good way to read Hacker News.
[01:16:11.560 --> 01:16:14.000]   Because if you look at the straight feeds of Hacker News,
[01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:15.960]   you only get the headline.
[01:16:15.960 --> 01:16:16.840]   You don't get texts.
[01:16:16.840 --> 01:16:17.360]   All right.
[01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:18.480]   There's so much.
[01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:20.120]   Feedly has done a pretty good job.
[01:16:20.120 --> 01:16:21.400]   It's a portrait only.
[01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:24.280]   But it does take advantage of the nice big portrait screen
[01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:26.880]   on the Samsung Galaxy tab.
[01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:27.840]   And this is the same thing.
[01:16:27.840 --> 01:16:30.280]   It's kind of a reader.
[01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:31.200]   I think does a nice job.
[01:16:31.200 --> 01:16:33.920]   We don't have Flipbook, you know, Flipboard, which
[01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:36.120]   is a really great app for the iPad.
[01:16:36.120 --> 01:16:37.800]   But this comes pretty close.
[01:16:37.800 --> 01:16:38.720]   Yeah, it looks similar.
[01:16:38.720 --> 01:16:39.240]   Yeah.
[01:16:39.240 --> 01:16:39.720]   It's nice.
[01:16:39.720 --> 01:16:42.160]   So I like this.
[01:16:42.160 --> 01:16:46.680]   Can never figure out where the menus are on these programs.
[01:16:46.680 --> 01:16:50.280]   OK, so you can subscribe.
[01:16:50.280 --> 01:16:51.680]   It's in the upper left, folks.
[01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:55.560]   You can subscribe to various feeds and so forth,
[01:16:55.560 --> 01:16:57.000]   various topics as well.
[01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:58.440]   And it makes a nice little magazine.
[01:16:58.440 --> 01:17:00.080]   I have to say, in some ways, this
[01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:01.840]   does really use-- you know, the portrait mode
[01:17:01.840 --> 01:17:04.520]   is extra long on a 16.9 tablet.
[01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:05.440]   But I don't mind this.
[01:17:05.440 --> 01:17:07.880]   This just kind of makes it very legible.
[01:17:07.880 --> 01:17:08.880]   It's very cool.
[01:17:08.880 --> 01:17:11.120]   And I wanted to show you this because Steve Gibson sent it
[01:17:11.120 --> 01:17:12.200]   to me.
[01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:14.680]   This is a really nice-- look at this.
[01:17:14.680 --> 01:17:15.840]   It folds up.
[01:17:15.840 --> 01:17:18.800]   Tablet stand that you could put in your bag.
[01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:19.680]   Oh, that is nice.
[01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:21.200]   It works with any kind of tablet.
[01:17:21.200 --> 01:17:25.120]   And the manufacturer's name is ARKON.
[01:17:25.120 --> 01:17:27.520]   He got it on Amazon, ARCON resources.
[01:17:27.520 --> 01:17:28.960]   They're about $10.
[01:17:28.960 --> 01:17:29.520]   So watch.
[01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:32.600]   You open the legs.
[01:17:32.600 --> 01:17:35.320]   And they have little soft pads so they don't slide.
[01:17:35.320 --> 01:17:36.760]   So you open the legs.
[01:17:36.760 --> 01:17:41.160]   And then his suggestion was to leave this--
[01:17:41.160 --> 01:17:42.160]   let's see.
[01:17:42.160 --> 01:17:43.960]   Oh, yeah, fold this up like that.
[01:17:43.960 --> 01:17:46.120]   So that's kind of the basic mode.
[01:17:46.120 --> 01:17:48.400]   And it's got little notches in the feet.
[01:17:48.400 --> 01:17:50.040]   So the tablet so it goes like this.
[01:17:50.040 --> 01:17:50.880]   It's very sturdy.
[01:17:50.880 --> 01:17:52.000]   And because of the rubber on the bottom,
[01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:53.400]   it just does not slide.
[01:17:53.400 --> 01:17:53.960]   Oh, yeah.
[01:17:53.960 --> 01:17:54.760]   That's really nice.
[01:17:54.760 --> 01:17:56.080]   So watch for the smart cover.
[01:17:56.080 --> 01:17:57.400]   10 bucks.
[01:17:57.400 --> 01:18:00.000]   So yeah, we missed the smart cover, right?
[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:00.160]   But--
[01:18:00.160 --> 01:18:01.600]   Yeah, I missed the smart cover on the tablet.
[01:18:01.600 --> 01:18:02.120]   Yeah.
[01:18:02.120 --> 01:18:02.920]   But at least we have this.
[01:18:02.920 --> 01:18:06.440]   And you can, of course, by changing this angle very easily
[01:18:06.440 --> 01:18:09.160]   to adjust the angle of the tablet
[01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:11.560]   to all sorts of different angles.
[01:18:11.560 --> 01:18:12.960]   So I think this is pretty nice.
[01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:16.200]   ARCON ARKON resources.
[01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:18.760]   And I think my tools for a while
[01:18:18.760 --> 01:18:21.880]   are going to be more tools on the Galaxy Tams.
[01:18:21.880 --> 01:18:23.240]   Honeycomb apps.
[01:18:23.240 --> 01:18:24.000]   Yeah, honeycomb.
[01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:25.120]   Honeycomb apps.
[01:18:25.120 --> 01:18:26.600]   You know, Google's apps look great.
[01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:29.160]   The context really-- it does a nice job.
[01:18:29.160 --> 01:18:30.200]   I don't want to show you that.
[01:18:30.200 --> 01:18:32.600]   It does a really nice job of using the display
[01:18:32.600 --> 01:18:33.760]   in a beautiful way.
[01:18:33.760 --> 01:18:34.600]   I hope--
[01:18:34.600 --> 01:18:35.400]   Females, awesome.
[01:18:35.400 --> 01:18:36.400]   Gmail's fantastic.
[01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:37.720]   Maps is really cool.
[01:18:37.720 --> 01:18:41.640]   I hope more apps take advantage of honeycomb.
[01:18:41.640 --> 01:18:44.840]   And it will, of course, give you a review of 3.1 when it comes out.
[01:18:44.840 --> 01:18:46.320]   But I have to say, it's buggy.
[01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:47.960]   It really is still a little bit buggy.
[01:18:47.960 --> 01:18:50.280]   You see the little hesitation?
[01:18:50.280 --> 01:18:50.720]   Yeah.
[01:18:50.720 --> 01:18:52.560]   And this is something that really bugs me.
[01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:53.760]   Maybe it's because of a widget thing,
[01:18:53.760 --> 01:18:57.880]   but it has to redraw everything when I change to portrait mode.
[01:18:57.880 --> 01:18:59.360]   That's not good.
[01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:01.560]   Yeah, the iPad does not do that.
[01:19:01.560 --> 01:19:03.360]   It's much more.
[01:19:03.360 --> 01:19:03.880]   OK.
[01:19:03.880 --> 01:19:05.000]   See, that's annoying.
[01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:06.080]   Right, yeah.
[01:19:06.080 --> 01:19:07.160]   Hope they fix that.
[01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:08.640]   But-- but--
[01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:10.160]   And I was a little negative about this.
[01:19:10.160 --> 01:19:11.480]   The more I use it, the more I like it.
[01:19:11.480 --> 01:19:13.200]   You played with yours more, Gina?
[01:19:13.200 --> 01:19:13.720]   I have.
[01:19:13.720 --> 01:19:14.200]   I have.
[01:19:14.200 --> 01:19:15.160]   I've been liking it.
[01:19:15.160 --> 01:19:17.040]   But you know, I have the iPad now.
[01:19:17.040 --> 01:19:17.520]   Oh.
[01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:21.680]   And so, you know, the iPads are pretty amazing device.
[01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:24.640]   So having them side by side has been really interesting to me.
[01:19:24.640 --> 01:19:27.040]   You know, all the Google I/O sessions are on YouTube.
[01:19:27.040 --> 01:19:28.240]   They went up like that day.
[01:19:28.240 --> 01:19:29.240]   So--
[01:19:29.240 --> 01:19:31.040]   And I was-- you know, had a lot of fun talking to people.
[01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:32.440]   But I didn't get to go to a lot of sessions.
[01:19:32.440 --> 01:19:35.800]   Last night, I watched the Honeycomb highlights session.
[01:19:35.800 --> 01:19:36.320]   Good.
[01:19:36.320 --> 01:19:38.080]   I'll have to watch that, because it's probably a lot of stuff.
[01:19:38.080 --> 01:19:39.080]   Really good.
[01:19:39.080 --> 01:19:40.400]   Nice walkthrough of like some of their decisions
[01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:43.840]   and what you can do in the UI, like changing it up to a tablet app.
[01:19:43.840 --> 01:19:44.920]   You know, the status bar.
[01:19:44.920 --> 01:19:45.600]   Oh, good.
[01:19:45.600 --> 01:19:46.360]   Recently, yeah.
[01:19:46.360 --> 01:19:48.360]   It's worth a watch if you really kind of want
[01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:51.160]   to get your head around what they were thinking with Honeycomb.
[01:19:51.160 --> 01:19:53.360]   One thing I do kind of like about Honeycomb--
[01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:55.560]   and I'd like to see this in Ice Cream Sandwich
[01:19:55.560 --> 01:19:57.640]   is the new notification system.
[01:19:57.640 --> 01:19:59.760]   On this, it's down at the bottom.
[01:19:59.760 --> 01:20:02.160]   And you can click individual notifications,
[01:20:02.160 --> 01:20:07.160]   or you can pull up the whole notification and it scrolls.
[01:20:07.160 --> 01:20:09.480]   And I think that this is actually a very nice system
[01:20:09.480 --> 01:20:10.920]   for notifications.
[01:20:10.920 --> 01:20:11.920]   Yes, I agree.
[01:20:11.920 --> 01:20:14.280]   I hope that this is part of Ice Cream Sandwich.
[01:20:14.280 --> 01:20:17.440]   And of course, I can close any individual notification
[01:20:17.440 --> 01:20:19.680]   just by tapping the X there.
[01:20:19.680 --> 01:20:22.440]   So I think this is pretty good.
[01:20:22.440 --> 01:20:22.720]   It is.
[01:20:22.720 --> 01:20:25.800]   And notifications have always been sort of Android's strong--
[01:20:25.800 --> 01:20:27.480]   one of the strongest parts, right?
[01:20:27.480 --> 01:20:28.720]   So it's better than the eyes.
[01:20:28.720 --> 01:20:29.220]   Yeah.
[01:20:29.220 --> 01:20:31.440]   Honeycomb has some ways to go.
[01:20:31.440 --> 01:20:33.600]   I'm looking forward to Ice Cream Sandwich.
[01:20:33.600 --> 01:20:34.160]   Yeah.
[01:20:34.160 --> 01:20:34.960]   Let's say that.
[01:20:34.960 --> 01:20:35.460]   Yes.
[01:20:35.460 --> 01:20:35.960]   N31.
[01:20:35.960 --> 01:20:36.460]   N31.
[01:20:36.460 --> 01:20:37.460]   We'll see.
[01:20:37.460 --> 01:20:37.960]   Yeah.
[01:20:37.960 --> 01:20:38.460]   All right.
[01:20:38.460 --> 01:20:40.920]   That does it for this week in Google for this week.
[01:20:40.920 --> 01:20:43.480]   Gina Trapani is at smarterware.org.
[01:20:43.480 --> 01:20:45.640]   Check out her great blog.
[01:20:45.640 --> 01:20:48.720]   Of course, she still writes for Life Hacker from time to time.
[01:20:48.720 --> 01:20:53.960]   And her day job is ThinkUpApp.com.
[01:20:53.960 --> 01:20:56.560]   Beta 12 just dropped yesterday.
[01:20:56.560 --> 01:20:59.120]   So download or install.
[01:20:59.120 --> 01:21:00.120]   It's getting better.
[01:21:00.120 --> 01:21:00.740]   It's getting better.
[01:21:00.740 --> 01:21:02.180]   We're coming close to 1.0.
[01:21:02.180 --> 01:21:05.980]   It is a really powerful Twitter analysis tool
[01:21:05.980 --> 01:21:10.340]   that I do hope becomes widespread use.
[01:21:10.340 --> 01:21:12.060]   Because I get so much out of it.
[01:21:12.060 --> 01:21:13.620]   I really am glad I have an account on it.
[01:21:13.620 --> 01:21:14.740]   Thank you.
[01:21:14.740 --> 01:21:18.620]   Someday I'll have my own ThinkUp server.
[01:21:18.620 --> 01:21:19.180]   Someday.
[01:21:19.180 --> 01:21:19.660]   Someday.
[01:21:19.660 --> 01:21:19.860]   It'll be good.
[01:21:19.860 --> 01:21:20.940]   We'll get you set yet.
[01:21:20.940 --> 01:21:22.540]   No, I read the instructions and everything.
[01:21:22.540 --> 01:21:24.820]   It was like my PHP is missing one thing.
[01:21:24.820 --> 01:21:26.380]   Yeah, it was the PDO library, right?
[01:21:26.380 --> 01:21:27.380]   Yeah.
[01:21:27.380 --> 01:21:28.620]   Well, I'm going to get you set up.
[01:21:28.620 --> 01:21:30.120]   I could get my sysadmins.
[01:21:30.120 --> 01:21:32.300]   They'd do it for me if I just ask.
[01:21:32.300 --> 01:21:34.100]   I'm kind of a do-it-yourself kind of guy.
[01:21:34.100 --> 01:21:35.820]   Yeah, I like that about you.
[01:21:35.820 --> 01:21:39.100]   I hate have to ask a sysadmins to do anything.
[01:21:39.100 --> 01:21:42.260]   Bear and Chris would do it for me in a heartbeat.
[01:21:42.260 --> 01:21:44.500]   Jeff Jarvis is at Buzzmachine.com.
[01:21:44.500 --> 01:21:47.700]   That's where he exposes all his intimate secrets.
[01:21:47.700 --> 01:21:49.700]   He's also the author of a great book, What Google Do.
[01:21:49.700 --> 01:21:50.940]   Soon to be Public Parts.
[01:21:50.940 --> 01:21:52.620]   I can't wait to see that.
[01:21:52.620 --> 01:21:53.220]   Did it come out?
[01:21:53.220 --> 01:21:55.660]   Where he will continue this conversation about public
[01:21:55.660 --> 01:21:57.260]   versus private.
[01:21:57.260 --> 01:22:01.100]   And he tweets at Jeff Jarvis, Gina tweets at Gina Tripani.
[01:22:01.100 --> 01:22:02.140]   So that makes sense.
[01:22:02.140 --> 01:22:02.740]   Gina what?
[01:22:02.740 --> 01:22:04.460]   Gina what?
[01:22:04.460 --> 01:22:05.820]   Tripani.
[01:22:05.820 --> 01:22:07.540]   Tripani.
[01:22:07.540 --> 01:22:10.620]   Is it related to trip, trip panning the brain,
[01:22:10.620 --> 01:22:12.700]   where you cut the skull out and you'll let it.
[01:22:12.700 --> 01:22:14.660]   Is that any--
[01:22:14.660 --> 01:22:17.220]   it's like that where it was invented at tripani?
[01:22:17.220 --> 01:22:18.020]   No relation.
[01:22:18.020 --> 01:22:19.660]   OK.
[01:22:19.660 --> 01:22:21.260]   Just checking.
[01:22:21.260 --> 01:22:22.100]   Isn't that what they call it?
[01:22:22.100 --> 01:22:24.020]   Tree panning?
[01:22:24.020 --> 01:22:26.460]   Where they cut a portion of the skull out
[01:22:26.460 --> 01:22:28.500]   and they let the--
[01:22:28.500 --> 01:22:30.660]   Define colon tree panning.
[01:22:30.660 --> 01:22:32.660]   Dude, look it up.
[01:22:32.660 --> 01:22:34.940]   It's what you're named after, so you ought to know.
[01:22:34.940 --> 01:22:35.700]   I should.
[01:22:35.700 --> 01:22:36.740]   You're right.
[01:22:36.740 --> 01:22:37.580]   Yes.
[01:22:37.580 --> 01:22:38.580]   Look at that.
[01:22:38.580 --> 01:22:39.060]   Press free.
[01:22:39.060 --> 01:22:41.500]   A person's skull with a treatment.
[01:22:41.500 --> 01:22:42.900]   A pen.
[01:22:42.900 --> 01:22:43.500]   Wow.
[01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:45.340]   It's kind of medieval.
[01:22:45.340 --> 01:22:47.660]   It's probably don't do it much anymore.
[01:22:47.660 --> 01:22:48.300]   That's TRE.
[01:22:48.300 --> 01:22:49.500]   I'm TRA.
[01:22:49.500 --> 01:22:51.660]   Oh, OK.
[01:22:51.660 --> 01:22:53.700]   So you have never perforated a person's skull
[01:22:53.700 --> 01:22:54.980]   and it's your knowledge.
[01:22:54.980 --> 01:22:57.820]   I have nods to my knowledge.
[01:22:57.820 --> 01:22:59.060]   Thank you, everybody, for joining us.
[01:22:59.060 --> 01:23:01.580]   We do this show every Wednesday, 1 p.m.
[01:23:01.580 --> 01:23:03.260]   Pacific, 4 p.m. Eastern Live.
[01:23:03.260 --> 01:23:03.900]   .twit.tv.
[01:23:03.900 --> 01:23:05.500]   If you'd like to watch along with us,
[01:23:05.500 --> 01:23:08.180]   and you could always download the show after the fact
[01:23:08.180 --> 01:23:12.380]   at twit.tv/twig.
[01:23:12.380 --> 01:23:13.300]   We appreciate your watching.
[01:23:13.300 --> 01:23:14.300]   Don't forget to buy a brick.
[01:23:14.300 --> 01:23:16.540]   We are selling bricks for the brick
[01:23:16.540 --> 01:23:19.380]   Twit House because we got to raise money.
[01:23:19.380 --> 01:23:22.620]   Because all this stuff that we're doing costs money.
[01:23:22.620 --> 01:23:25.020]   And you can do that at bricks.twit.tv.
[01:23:25.020 --> 01:23:26.300]   We do have international sales.
[01:23:26.300 --> 01:23:26.860]   It's a little tricky.
[01:23:26.860 --> 01:23:28.420]   You have to call the 800 number.
[01:23:28.420 --> 01:23:30.180]   It's toll free, but it's 855.
[01:23:30.180 --> 01:23:33.940]   If you have Skype, just Skype out to 855, and that's free.
[01:23:33.940 --> 01:23:36.580]   And you can order the brick and everything.
[01:23:36.580 --> 01:23:37.620]   But I do apologize.
[01:23:37.620 --> 01:23:39.860]   It's so hard to do it if you're an international.
[01:23:39.860 --> 01:23:42.700]   I don't know why that is.
[01:23:42.700 --> 01:23:44.340]   Has something to do with--
[01:23:44.340 --> 01:23:45.900]   I don't know-- payment.
[01:23:45.900 --> 01:23:47.660]   Probably.
[01:23:47.660 --> 01:23:50.100]   bricks.twit.tv.
[01:23:50.100 --> 01:23:51.780]   We've got the 4x8, the 8x8.
[01:23:51.780 --> 01:23:54.660]   And you can even get your logo on there.
[01:23:54.660 --> 01:23:55.340]   Oh, yeah.
[01:23:55.340 --> 01:23:56.580]   I'm so doing this.
[01:23:56.580 --> 01:23:57.460]   You don't have to do that.
[01:23:57.460 --> 01:23:58.700]   My name will be all the wall.
[01:23:58.700 --> 01:23:59.780]   No, you don't have to do that.
[01:23:59.780 --> 01:24:03.180]   We're going to-- I'm going to get a big--
[01:24:03.180 --> 01:24:04.980]   you know how when they have a construction project,
[01:24:04.980 --> 01:24:07.940]   you have the big plaque on the wall.
[01:24:07.940 --> 01:24:09.620]   This is the brick Twit House built
[01:24:09.620 --> 01:24:12.900]   May through October 2018.
[01:24:12.900 --> 01:24:14.820]   And the names of the construction company.
[01:24:14.820 --> 01:24:17.100]   And then I'll have all the names of the staff,
[01:24:17.100 --> 01:24:18.100]   and then all the host names.
[01:24:18.100 --> 01:24:19.860]   So your name will be on a big plaque.
[01:24:19.860 --> 01:24:20.740]   Aw.
[01:24:20.740 --> 01:24:21.420]   That's so great.
[01:24:21.420 --> 01:24:22.700]   I cannot wait to see this.
[01:24:22.700 --> 01:24:23.540]   It's going to be fun.
[01:24:23.540 --> 01:24:25.300]   I've got to come see the cottos though before.
[01:24:25.300 --> 01:24:26.380]   Yeah, well, you've got time.
[01:24:26.380 --> 01:24:29.140]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:24:29.140 --> 01:24:30.380]   Oh, yeah.
[01:24:30.380 --> 01:24:32.580]   Just any time sometime later this year,
