[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800]   Coming up on this week in Google, I, Jason Howell, replaced Leo, but only for a week.
[00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.560]   He's enjoying himself in Las Vegas, joined by Jeff Jarvis, of course.
[00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.760]   Also Kevin Marks, we're going to talk all about Samsung's big announcement.
[00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:17.160]   Touch on a few highlights from Android O from our perspective, even though we talked about
[00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.420]   it a little bit before.
[00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:19.720]   Touch on that a little bit.
[00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.920]   Also some privacy stuff that's going through Congress right now that could affect you and
[00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.920]   a whole lot more.
[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.200]   This week in Google is next.

[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.360]   This week in Google, I'm Jason Hall filling in for Leo Laport.
[00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.280]   I think Leo is in Las Vegas.
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.760]   Hopefully it's nice, sunny and warm and he's enjoying himself there.
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.120]   I know he's enjoying his show.
[00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.120]   What's that?
[00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:09.000]   There's a picture from his feed that you want to see of a coke flight.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.160]   Capital seat from his Facebook feed.
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.160]   It's hilarious.
[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.720]   Is he poolside?
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.640]   What I need to know is no, no, no, no.
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.000]   He's at a coke restaurant.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   Oh, OK.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Look at what we're Facebook.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   All right.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   We'll work on that.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   Jeff Jarvis.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   Ruining your intros.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.760]   No, do ruining your intros.
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.640]   You never ruin intros, man.
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.840]   It's great to do a show with you.
[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:31.840]   Well, maybe you do.
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.440]   But I don't consider it ruining.
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.960]   I consider it just awesome that I'm doing another show with you.
[00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:40.680]   Jeff Jarvis, Buzzmachine.com, professor at the CUNY School of Journalism.
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.880]   You know, I'm always a pleasure to be out with you, sir.
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:43.880]   Absolutely.
[00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:44.880]   Thank you so much.
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:45.880]   It's great to be back.
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.640]   Mark's from KevinMarks.com.
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.080]   It's great to be on with you again.
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:56.080]   I think we did a show together right when Android N was launching last year.
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.080]   Oh, that's right.
[00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.080]   Yeah.
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.080]   We did it with Nougat.
[00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.080]   Well, yeah, it wasn't N anymore.
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.080]   It was Nougat.
[00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.080]   Yes.
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.080]   So it's great to--
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.320]   Oh, what percentage of phones now?
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:07.320]   Where is it now?
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.040]   I mean, it's definitely single digits.
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.520]   It's probably lower single digits, as my guess.
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:12.520]   Let's see here.
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.840]   Android distribution numbers.
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:21.200]   I'm guessing somewhere sub 5% is my pulling it out of thin air.
[00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.520]   And Nougat is the grand total of my count.
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:26.520]   2.8%.
[00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:27.520]   Woo-hoo.
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:28.520]   2.8% Nougat.
[00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:29.520]   Oof.
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.160]   Isn't it true that those were this house?
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.160]   So that's--
[00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:36.520]   Well, are you all on Nougat?
[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:40.360]   I mean, I assume, Jeff, you have the pixel right, so you're on Nougat.
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.360]   Yes, Bob.
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.360]   I'm always open for--
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.360]   I have a pixel now.
[00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:44.520]   Oh, you do.
[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:45.520]   So you do?
[00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:46.520]   You do?
[00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.040]   How do you like it?
[00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.040]   It's very nice.
[00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.040]   Well, I've still got the Nexus 6, which is also for Nougat.
[00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.040]   Yeah.
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.440]   And Rosie just got an ultra--
[00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:55.440]   LG Ultra?
[00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:56.440]   LG?
[00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.160]   LG, which is also a Nougat.
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.720]   So we're worse, but we're Nougat machines now.
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:02.920]   You're part of the 2.8%.
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.960]   But 2.8%, we're in the--
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:05.960]   Oh.
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:07.640]   Within normally, yeah.
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.120]   Man, that is rough.
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.600]   Do we think this is ever going to be a problem that's going to be solved in the Android world?
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:13.600]   It probably won't.
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:14.600]   How do you solve this?
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.440]   I don't think you do.
[00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:18.440]   It's just--
[00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.400]   Well, I mean, they've sort of halved it with sending updates by other means.
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.760]   But yeah, it's kind of a shame.
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:26.760]   It is.
[00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:27.760]   I mean, yeah.
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.240]   I mean, because we're two months away from AM or something, aren't we?
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.200]   Maybe there's an audio coming shortly.
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.200]   Well, yeah.
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:42.120]   So, oh, we got the information on the developer preview for, oh, I'm assuming you guys talked
[00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.120]   all about that last week.
[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.120]   Actually, oh, not him.
[00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.120]   I'm going to wait.
[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.120]   Yeah.
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.720]   Because you do.
[00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.960]   Did you guys dive into that last week?
[00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:52.960]   Not really, no.
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.480]   I have no-- I haven't looked at it actually.
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.280]   What's new?
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.360]   Well, there's a number of things here.
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:00.800]   Let me pull it up.
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.360]   I just assumed so because I think Android O was announced last Wednesday.
[00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:07.800]   I'm not sure it didn't come out until Thursday.
[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:08.800]   Was it Thursday?
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.440]   See, full disclosure.
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.320]   I was out on vacation last week.
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.120]   I was in Canada.
[00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.480]   So I had no mobile network.
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.280]   Things are slower there.
[00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:23.560]   They were for me because without mobile connectivity, I was able to enjoy life without a phone,
[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.680]   for the most part, except for the camera.
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.800]   I got to tell you, it was really, really nice.
[00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:35.920]   But I found out about Android O like two days after it actually hit.
[00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.800]   And so I was kind of completely in the dark.
[00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.200]   So if you can, man, if we didn't talk about it.
[00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:41.800]   I mean, hey, it's here.
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:43.000]   We're talking about it right now.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:50.760]   So just a little bit of insight into what to expect, at least with the developer preview,
[00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.880]   there's going to be some improvements to notifications.
[00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:56.240]   For the most part, there's like notification groups.
[00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:02.040]   So you can take all of your news notifications, for example, from different news apps that
[00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:04.400]   you have installed, put them into their own channel.
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:08.640]   I think they're calling it notification channels so that you can group them together
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:13.800]   and manage them as a group instead of individually with the whole idea being that you're kind
[00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.960]   of cleaning up your notifications so it's not filled with a bunch of information.
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:23.840]   You kind of collapse it down into kind of categories that you determine.
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.320]   That could be handy, I suppose.
[00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:32.840]   There's also kind of like time management around notifications so you can snooze things
[00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:40.600]   to later if I wanted to manage my notifications the same way that I manage Google inbox emails,
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:45.920]   for example, so like you get an inbox email and within the app, you can either swipe it
[00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:48.880]   one way to delay it or archive it or whatever.
[00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:54.840]   It's kind of making notifications a little bit more like that.
[00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:55.840]   I don't know.
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:56.840]   It's part of inbox?
[00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:57.840]   Not as part of inbox.
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:59.800]   No, I'm just using inbox as an example.
[00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:01.840]   There's just a fitting inbox into right, right?
[00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:06.160]   Yeah, I mean, this is literally taking your notifications and applying kind of like being
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:11.760]   able to snooze a notification later because personally I use my notifications as a to-do
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:15.280]   list many times which means I always have these notifications hanging out up there because
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:19.480]   I don't want to swipe them away because I want to do that a little bit later.
[00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:25.040]   And if I swipe it away, I might forget because I know myself far too well and I will forget.
[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:32.920]   So this is a feature that I'm very much so looking forward to.
[00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:36.960]   Better kind of built-in auto fill for things like password managers.
[00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:43.800]   So if you use LastPass, one password, a bunch of different password managers right now,
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:48.040]   there's okay integration into Android where it's kind of hacking into the accessibility
[00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:54.360]   features to allow for drawing over the top of other apps to insert your passwords into
[00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:56.120]   places that they need to go.
[00:07:56.120 --> 00:08:01.040]   But in essence, it's kind of a hacky way to do it and I'm amazed that we were able to
[00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:02.280]   do it up until now.
[00:08:02.280 --> 00:08:07.880]   Well, with Android O, they're going to kind of build that into the OS in an official way
[00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:11.960]   so that it can be done securely and it won't be kind of a hack job the way it is kind of
[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:14.840]   right now.
[00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:15.840]   Let's see here.
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:16.840]   What else?
[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:17.840]   Lock screen shortcuts.
[00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:18.840]   So you know on the...
[00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:19.840]   See, I don't know.
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:22.800]   Well, yeah, I don't think I'm showing anything off.
[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:27.120]   But you know that down in the corners you have those little shortcuts.
[00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:29.800]   You can assign those to whatever you want.
[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:33.640]   So instead of it being a camera shortcut on your lock screen, you could assign it to
[00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:39.720]   any app or a bunch of actions, that sort of stuff.
[00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:40.720]   Let's see here.
[00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:41.720]   What else?
[00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:46.640]   Background management of apps, which I think is actually probably a really good thing for
[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:47.840]   battery.
[00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:49.640]   Something that iOS does really well, right?
[00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:56.360]   Like Android is really good for allowing you to multitask and everything because the OS
[00:08:56.360 --> 00:09:01.680]   is very wide open as far as allowing apps and developers to have access to the full
[00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:04.400]   phone even when it's not in the foreground and everything like that.
[00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:09.080]   Well, what happens, you know, some apps go rogue and they kind of take over the process
[00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:12.920]   in the background and in turn your battery performance takes a hit.
[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:14.920]   Performance of the device takes a hit.
[00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:20.040]   Because on iOS it's really kind of like more or less it's a single, you know, there's a
[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:24.360]   single app and focus and everything else in the background is really limited and that
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:26.480]   ends up improving the performance of your device.
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:29.720]   And it sounds like with Android O we're going to get a little bit more of that.
[00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:33.640]   It's going to go deeper in controlling what's going on in the background.
[00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:34.640]   That's good.
[00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:40.800]   I mean, I had that problem when I, you know, I'm in the UK at the moment and before I got
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:48.920]   a local SIM, I was on the team mobile roaming thing, which is Throttle to 2G.
[00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:52.000]   And that was a great way for my background apps to just sit there and spin and then
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:53.760]   die and crash into my phone.
[00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.960]   We just sit there and lock up for random amounts of time.
[00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:57.480]   So that was that was definitely educational.
[00:09:57.480 --> 00:09:59.480]   I hope we need that.
[00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:00.480]   Yeah.
[00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:04.320]   I mean, always, always looking for better battery and performance with Android and it
[00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:09.760]   seems like the last two or three major versions, they've really kind of, they continue to
[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:12.640]   roll out improvements that are hopefully extending our battery.
[00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:19.680]   I think a lot of the doze improvements from N and Marshmallow and NuGet have really helped.
[00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:22.840]   I mean, they've helped a tremendous amount as far as I can tell.
[00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:25.240]   So managing the background stuff is even better.
[00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:33.200]   It was so strange that, well, as Kevin said, when I am abroad at its roaming, that hurts.
[00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:38.200]   And then if I really weighs on, I'm dead.
[00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:39.200]   If you leave weighs on.
[00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:40.200]   OK.
[00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:44.280]   Because it's just churning and that's probably, yeah, that's probably using up a lot of resources
[00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:45.280]   in the background.
[00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:48.760]   But then every once in a while, there'll be a day where suddenly I look at it and it's
[00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:50.520]   11% and I don't know.
[00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:54.480]   And it just says Android system running and I don't know why it dies.
[00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:56.560]   It's very rare, but it does happen occasionally.
[00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:57.560]   Yeah.
[00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:02.800]   So the way I found was that when I got my, you know, so I got my new pixel XO, so my
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:07.520]   old Nexus 6, I just left on the side and it kept running for five days because I wasn't
[00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:08.520]   touching it.
[00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:15.000]   So clearly, it's mostly the screen that is me interacting with the choose things up, not
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   just background stuff.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.440]   Well, I mean, it's not even just screen, right?
[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:25.760]   Like with does, if it's just sitting on a counter, Android is smart enough to realize
[00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:26.920]   that it's not moving around.
[00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:27.920]   So it's not in the pocket.
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:31.360]   So it doesn't need to be kind of ready to do anything.
[00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:33.840]   And so it really kind of limits things down.
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:37.360]   And yeah, that's just one of the ways where does has really, you know, in those batteries
[00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:39.560]   that I was actually impressed it, it lasted that long.
[00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:40.560]   Yeah.
[00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:41.560]   Oh, totally.
[00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:42.560]   I've seen that with tablets too.
[00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:46.480]   It used to be because I don't hardly ever use tablets anymore, but I'll charge it up
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:50.160]   and then I'll forget about it, set it down and I'll go back to it a week, two weeks later
[00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:51.160]   sometimes.
[00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:53.560]   And I mean, it used to be that it didn't matter what you did.
[00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:56.960]   That tablet, even though it was just sitting there, wasn't going to last more than a couple
[00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:57.960]   of days.
[00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:01.120]   It just, it just wasn't smart enough to maneuver that.
[00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:08.000]   And now they can last many days before, but I will add not nearly as long as the iPad
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:13.600]   that I have had at the house that one time I charged it fully, used it, set it down completely
[00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:18.480]   forgot about it for almost a month, went back to it, totally still on, totally had battery
[00:12:18.480 --> 00:12:19.480]   power.
[00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:21.720]   I was like, wow, that's awesome.
[00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:25.880]   I mean, you could literally forget about it for a month and it's still powered up.
[00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:26.880]   Just crazy.
[00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:28.920]   Well, it's that kind of a less.
[00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:29.920]   Yeah.
[00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:32.320]   You know, we're getting there.
[00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:36.000]   You know, a number of API changes, of course, for developers that make them happy picture
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.880]   and picture mode.
[00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:43.760]   I mean, all in all, like I'm still really deciding, I don't know, based on what I've
[00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:48.040]   told you and there's some, you know, kind of like UI enhancements with settings, pain
[00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:53.680]   and stuff like that, but really no truly like, oh my God, I got to have that thing right
[00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:54.680]   there.
[00:12:54.680 --> 00:12:57.840]   This is the reason to have Android O that you could put on a commercial and someone would
[00:12:57.840 --> 00:12:59.760]   be like, that's a cool new thing.
[00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:01.440]   I have to have that new version.
[00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:04.960]   Anything, I mean, anything that I've even read out that jumps out at you and strikes
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:05.960]   you like that.
[00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:06.960]   Nope.
[00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:07.960]   Nope.
[00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:14.160]   You think they're hiding stuff back until, until IO, they usually do to some degree.
[00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:19.160]   I mean, we've, we definitely learned more about NuGet or Android N at the time at IO
[00:13:19.160 --> 00:13:25.240]   than we did in the developer preview that they unleashed like a couple of months prior.
[00:13:25.240 --> 00:13:26.960]   They got a hold onto some secrets, right?
[00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:30.840]   They can't let it all and also things that aren't working as well right now.
[00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:32.440]   Like it's a developer preview.
[00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:37.440]   This is literally earlier access than they normally do to just get developers kind of
[00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:40.280]   get their minds going as far as how they're going to build their apps.
[00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:41.280]   Or you use it.
[00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:42.960]   I'm not yet actually.
[00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:46.440]   Like I said, I was out on vacation last week.
[00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:50.400]   I only got back Monday evening and I have and I've been super slammed this week.
[00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:52.160]   So I haven't had a chance to install it.
[00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:54.760]   I don't know if I'm going to put it on the pixel.
[00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:58.080]   I have the pixel C in the other room that I think I'm going to install it on first to
[00:13:58.080 --> 00:13:59.760]   just like play around with it.
[00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:04.080]   Maybe once it's more stable than I'll, then I'll live with it on the pixel, on the Google
[00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:06.960]   Pixel phone.
[00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:10.360]   And that's where you really start to see a lot of those little changes and everything.
[00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:12.440]   Kind of firsthand, you know.
[00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:16.440]   One thing to read about the features is another thing to like live with it.
[00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:20.280]   And in a couple of days, you quickly realize the things that are cool about it and maybe
[00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:24.920]   the things that need to be fixed before the next developer preview.
[00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:28.760]   Well, I mean, the weird thing, I still did a video for N last year.
[00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:33.120]   And I didn't realize about half the like the rapid app switching and that stuff.
[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:35.480]   I had no idea it was there because it was so subtle.
[00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:36.480]   Right.
[00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:39.680]   You know, there's a long press and double clicks on the or the app switch icon was like,
[00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:42.680]   I wouldn't, I didn't know I had, I was able to do that.
[00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:46.000]   And then when I just cover that, you're like game over, that is like the best feature
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   in the world.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   I love that.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.760]   That's useful feature, but you still remember it's there.
[00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:50.760]   And that's the, yeah.
[00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:54.560]   And I suspect, you know, for most users, they won't realize it's there either.
[00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:55.560]   Mm hmm.
[00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:59.240]   No, it's, it's one of those like it's, it's, it's so well integrated.
[00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:00.240]   It's too hidden.
[00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:02.160]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:03.160]   That's true.
[00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:04.160]   Yeah.
[00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:05.160]   Um, yeah.
[00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:06.560]   So that's Android O.
[00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:07.560]   We did not.
[00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:08.560]   Thank you for that.
[00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:12.760]   Well, yeah, no, I'm, I'm, I just kind of assumed like I didn't even throw it in your
[00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:13.760]   eyes soon.
[00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:16.840]   It would be in there, but maybe it came out a day later and I completely missed it.
[00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:20.160]   Oh, we were probably blathering about philosophy or something.
[00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:24.000]   Well, today we'll stick pretty close to Google, I think for the most part.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.600]   We've got some things outside of that.
[00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:30.800]   The big announcement, and I was on hand here this morning on set along with Ron Richards
[00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:35.400]   from all about Android and we were covering Samsung's big news.
[00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:42.480]   Samsung unveiled their next flagship device, the Samsung Galaxy S8, or rather the S8 family
[00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:45.400]   because now there are two different sizes of the S8.
[00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:54.320]   This is the S8, which is a 5.8 inch display and then the S8 plus, which is a 6.2 inch
[00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:56.680]   display and not just a display in.
[00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:58.320]   It's needing to settle.
[00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:04.400]   Yeah, settle, but I have to imagine like everybody that I've been reading has says the 6.2 inch
[00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:05.400]   is sizable.
[00:16:05.400 --> 00:16:06.840]   Like it's a beast.
[00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:11.400]   Um, but they say infinity display because there are no bezels on the side.
[00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:13.200]   It wraps around all their devices.
[00:16:13.200 --> 00:16:14.200]   Oh, okay.
[00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:20.460]   Well, that's, so when we were shopping the new phones, um, I originally got Rosie the
[00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:23.040]   Galaxy S7 and she said, I don't like this.
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:25.120]   This is no improvement over the previous galaxies.
[00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:26.440]   Um, I need something bigger.
[00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:28.320]   So I got the ultra instead.
[00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:31.920]   So clearly they've, that, that would have worked as a thing if it was actually available
[00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:34.280]   and not just being pre-announced for three months.
[00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:35.280]   Yeah.
[00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:40.920]   Um, I think it's interesting that they're, I mean, they're going all in on the wrap around
[00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:41.920]   display.
[00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:42.920]   I mean, the whole device.
[00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:44.920]   No, I'm still unsure about that.
[00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:48.800]   That, that, that I didn't get that one because that was like, I don't want extra touch things
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:49.800]   on the side.
[00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:52.600]   It's going to annoy, annoy Rosie when she tries to use it.
[00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:55.800]   You know what I, I fly a lot.
[00:16:55.800 --> 00:17:01.040]   So you have to hand your phone to somebody to put it on the thing to read it and they're
[00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:03.360]   so careful not to touch any surface.
[00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:05.080]   So it doesn't go off.
[00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:06.800]   Now the edges there.
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:07.800]   Right.
[00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:15.440]   Well, yeah, and I mean the edge initially, uh, hat, you know, it had like extra functionality
[00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:16.440]   built into it.
[00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:18.200]   It was like, it was like Samsung.
[00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:19.200]   Is that gone?
[00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:23.280]   When, when, well, when Samsung first started rolling out the edge, they were really trying
[00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:24.920]   to justify why it existed.
[00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:26.920]   So they built in well, you can have a second.
[00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:30.240]   It's like a side display and it's, you know, a shortcut bar.
[00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:32.920]   I don't think that that, I'm guessing that that's probably not gone.
[00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:36.200]   I'm guessing that there's a little bit of that built into this, but that's really not
[00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:37.200]   the focus.
[00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:40.360]   I didn't mention that a single time during the presentation today.
[00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:43.480]   It was all about isn't this a beautiful device.
[00:17:43.480 --> 00:17:47.200]   We've removed the bezels on the side by wrapping the display around the edges.
[00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:50.120]   We've taken the front button that you're used to seeing.
[00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:55.080]   I mean, it's iconic for Samsung's, uh, Galaxy brand and they've removed that.
[00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:57.760]   Although actually they haven't entirely removed it.
[00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:01.720]   The button is a physical button that resides underneath the display.
[00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:04.800]   So when you're looking at the display, you don't see the button, the home button on the
[00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:06.360]   front, but it's there.
[00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:11.960]   So you have to know and it's pressure sensitive, kind of like Apple's three touch.
[00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:14.160]   So you pressure, it's pressure sensitive.
[00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:18.640]   You push down hard there and that will act as the home button.
[00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:22.880]   So a little bit of learning, I guess as a user that that exists.
[00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:26.240]   It's going to be trying hard to hold onto that.
[00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:27.680]   Yeah, I know, right?
[00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:31.720]   Well, maybe, I mean, man, it's just been the way it has been for them.
[00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:36.080]   It's probably just, you know, they consider it to be an iconic feature of their devices
[00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:41.360]   and, uh, you know, a signature of their brand and, uh, don't let go of it.
[00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:43.840]   Don't let go of your signature, you know.
[00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:48.240]   Uh, they did move the fingerprint reader to the back and it's actually right next to
[00:18:48.240 --> 00:18:49.240]   the camera.
[00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:50.240]   It'll give you a wins one.
[00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:51.240]   Yeah.
[00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:52.240]   Uh, well, so okay.
[00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:56.000]   So the, the, on the pixel, you've got the fingerprint reader kind of dead center on the
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:01.200]   phone with the camera, with the camera all the way up there on the S8, the fingerprint
[00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:03.560]   reader is right next to the camera.
[00:19:03.560 --> 00:19:04.560]   You can see it right there.
[00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:06.560]   You put your finger on the lens that opens.
[00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:07.560]   Yeah.
[00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:08.800]   Yeah, that's my guess.
[00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:13.840]   I mean, maybe you learn not to do that eventually, but it really seems like it'd be pretty easy
[00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:18.080]   to, to just throw your finger on the camera all the time.
[00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:19.800]   I don't know.
[00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:21.240]   I guess we'll see how that works.
[00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:28.120]   Uh, they say it's the highest, uh, screen to body ratio than ever before with the display.
[00:19:28.120 --> 00:19:29.880]   Um, what else?
[00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:34.400]   HDR, high dynamic range, basically for the, for, uh, the display.
[00:19:34.400 --> 00:19:36.680]   So I'm sure the display, it looks super sharp.
[00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:40.240]   I mean, ultimately, you know, you can look at that and you can see they really went for
[00:19:40.240 --> 00:19:46.480]   a very different design language, uh, with this versus the previous two Samsung Galaxy
[00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:47.480]   S devices.
[00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:48.480]   Yeah.
[00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:49.480]   I think it looks really nice.
[00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:50.480]   It does look nice.
[00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:54.720]   I mean, having looked at the seven and the seven edged, you know, last week and gone,
[00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:56.440]   there's nothing very exciting about these.
[00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:59.280]   Um, that, that does look much more compelling.
[00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:05.880]   Um, then what else I'm trying to think about what's really important here.
[00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:11.280]   Uh, you know, they, they really talked up the security, uh, aspects of things.
[00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:15.360]   Like they mentioned, of course, at the very top, I expected them to do this.
[00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:19.720]   They, they really wanted to make sure that everybody knew, you know, that they take security
[00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:25.840]   of users seriously and that they put all of their phones through top notch security protection
[00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:30.120]   and, and you know, scanning and it's just this whole inspection process that they dive
[00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:31.120]   into.
[00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:35.080]   They mentioned little to nothing about battery throughout the entire event as far as I can
[00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:36.080]   tell.
[00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:39.360]   I'm not even sure the word battery came out of the lights.
[00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:43.720]   You saw the story and the rundown about the, the store.
[00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:48.800]   Well, so a, uh, a Samsung store burst into flames.
[00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:49.800]   What?
[00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:52.120]   Um, quick before the, uh, announcement.
[00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:54.160]   They just can't win.
[00:20:54.160 --> 00:20:55.400]   You've got to be kidding me.
[00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:56.400]   I don't know.
[00:20:56.400 --> 00:21:01.720]   They're like batteries are bad word, uh, fires are bad word.
[00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:05.720]   Let's just talk about our inspection process.
[00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:09.880]   I mean, seriously, I'm sure, I'm sure it was in there, but if it was in there, I missed
[00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:12.800]   them saying the word battery even once.
[00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:13.800]   Wow.
[00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:17.120]   Uh, you know, cause I don't even think, I mean, maybe they, you know what, it probably came
[00:21:17.120 --> 00:21:21.880]   up with like battery performance or battery life, but even that I have a hard time remembering
[00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:24.040]   that they said anything like that.
[00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:30.200]   Um, but yeah, the S eight is the smaller version, $750.
[00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:33.440]   The S eight plus is the larger version, $850.
[00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:37.440]   So for an extra hundred bucks, you get the larger screen real estate and might be a little
[00:21:37.440 --> 00:21:38.680]   too large for your pocket.
[00:21:38.680 --> 00:21:41.840]   So be prepared, uh, preorder starts tomorrow.
[00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:46.200]   If you preorder tomorrow, you get a free, uh, one of their new gear VRs.
[00:21:46.200 --> 00:21:50.560]   They've done that in the past where if you preorder for the S seven, I think, uh, they'd
[00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:52.680]   give you the gear VR along with it.
[00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:55.600]   They've redesigned the gear VR to have a motion controller.
[00:21:55.600 --> 00:22:00.280]   Now that looks a lot like, uh, or at least in some ways looks like the Oculus touch.
[00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:07.600]   It has the big kind of flat, uh, touch surface that's round and yeah, I think mobile VR seems
[00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:10.040]   to be going in this direction.
[00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:16.960]   So, uh, so, so I see in here the, the, the, uh, phone can be desktop little pod.
[00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:17.960]   You can put your phone in.
[00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:18.960]   Yeah.
[00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:20.520]   That analysis is a real product or as a concept.
[00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:21.800]   No, it's a real product.
[00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:27.560]   So that is, um, it's a, it's a dock that they call the Samsung decks.
[00:22:27.560 --> 00:22:29.960]   And as you can see in the, the photo right here, right?
[00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:34.760]   Like it's, it's a desktop dock that you just set the phone into.
[00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:38.600]   It has connectivity for a keyboard, for a mouse.
[00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:39.600]   It has ether.
[00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:41.400]   Uh, I don't know if it has ethernet actually.
[00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:43.800]   Now that I think about it, but basically you drop your phone.
[00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:46.640]   It probably doesn't actually because it's all coming from your phone.
[00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:51.520]   You drop your phone in there and if you have a monitor plugged into it, it then turns your
[00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:54.560]   phone into a desktop environment.
[00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:58.160]   And you know, you can use your keyboard and your mouse and operate your phone through
[00:22:58.160 --> 00:22:59.160]   the desktop environment.
[00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:06.160]   They have a partnership with, with Microsoft to make Microsoft's suite of apps, uh, com,
[00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:11.720]   more compatible and work better in that environment with resizable windows and all that stuff
[00:23:11.720 --> 00:23:14.880]   you would expect out of a desktop, uh, class OS.
[00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:16.600]   It looks like it does have ethernet.
[00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:20.920]   Does it have ethernet about the, on and get the, you can get a picture.
[00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:25.440]   So if you look at the link there, oh, okay, it's a picture of the back.
[00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:28.040]   So it's not just fully wireless.
[00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:29.040]   Okay.
[00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:32.600]   Um, yeah, that is interesting.
[00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:36.280]   So that was, I mean, as fast as me as this does, there are a story like this.
[00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:39.640]   It gets you to the point that you don't need a computer.
[00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:41.240]   Your phone is your computer.
[00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:42.240]   Yeah.
[00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:46.280]   Um, I guess my question is, but who's doing this?
[00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:52.440]   I mean, I realize it's the future potentially that why do we have this desktop, but I don't
[00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:53.440]   know.
[00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:55.000]   Like I just don't see myself.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.560]   I don't see myself going.
[00:23:56.560 --> 00:24:00.280]   I'm going to, from now on, I'm going to use my phone as my computer at home.
[00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:03.600]   I'm going to get a monitor, a keyboard, a mouse plugging into this thing.
[00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:05.640]   And now my phone is, is my computer.
[00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:09.200]   Like I, I respect that this is a direction.
[00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:10.200]   Like we've seen this before.
[00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:14.400]   Motorola did it, uh, with the atrix, I believe it was called.
[00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:18.360]   And you know, it keeps happening and they keep trying for it, but I don't know.
[00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:19.880]   I feel like, here's where it makes sense to me.
[00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:20.880]   Yeah.
[00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:26.360]   Is in the enterprise, uh, in a company like an ad agencies that hotel you and have you
[00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:28.520]   move around desk, you know, where you're going to be.
[00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:33.000]   Uh, now to understand, you know, Google drive solves that problem.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.240]   I can use any computer anywhere in Chrome OS solves that problem.
[00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:37.240]   Right.
[00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:42.280]   But if I want my own stuff, um, my store local storage and some apps and other things, then
[00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:47.000]   you know, it's a way that I can move from desk to desk and city to city and, and, and
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:49.400]   always have or hotel to hotel even potentially.
[00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:50.400]   Yeah.
[00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:52.000]   Always have, uh, but what is it running?
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.680]   Is it running like a promo list, like thing?
[00:24:56.680 --> 00:25:00.720]   So it's running an Android, but it, but they've tweaked it to, to behave better.
[00:25:00.720 --> 00:25:01.720]   Yeah.
[00:25:01.720 --> 00:25:06.720]   I mean, yeah, so, you know, you know, all I, all, all I travel with anymore is my pixel
[00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:12.240]   C. Okay.
[00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:13.760]   So I'm, I'm using Android with docs with Chrome and drive.
[00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:15.560]   And that's it.
[00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:16.680]   You're living in this world.
[00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:19.520]   I'm very similar world to this, but does it feel Chrome OS?
[00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:23.160]   It feels like I haven't played with that enough to, to, to understand it.
[00:25:23.160 --> 00:25:24.640]   It's quite cause it's Chrome.
[00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:25.640]   It's just Chrome.
[00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:26.640]   It's basically Chrome.
[00:25:26.640 --> 00:25:27.640]   Okay.
[00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:28.640]   Yeah.
[00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:29.840]   Don't forget, don't forget.
[00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:33.000]   I'm living love you to Google as I do.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   I'm on, I've been a Chrome OS for two and a half years.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.600]   So lie, we go to the world is Chrome period.
[00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:40.600]   The Chrome OS is good.
[00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:41.600]   Yeah.
[00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:43.600]   No, I, I, I, I get irritated now.
[00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:44.600]   I get irritated now.
[00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:45.600]   I still use.
[00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:46.600]   Sorry.
[00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:47.600]   Well, the pics.
[00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:48.600]   Sorry.
[00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:51.200]   I'm interested in no one might.
[00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:54.200]   You, you, you, you go.
[00:25:54.200 --> 00:26:00.160]   I'm still using the Chromebook pixel that I got at Google IO three and a half years ago,
[00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:01.400]   whenever it was, maybe four years ago.
[00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:02.400]   So am I.
[00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:04.400]   That's what I'm on right now.
[00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:06.600]   Oh, I love this little guy.
[00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:12.600]   Yeah, no, I, I love this machine, although I am running into slowdowns and stuff on it.
[00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:16.600]   But, but that's, I mean, there is this, we're, this, we're, we're, this, we're sort of
[00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:18.920]   plateau in Moore's law now, whether that's what's happening.
[00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:21.680]   You know, I, when I bought, I, you know, I've been refreshing all my hardware.
[00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:25.480]   I bought a new Mac and it's like, I have no reason to buy this year's Mac.
[00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:27.400]   I can buy last year's Mac and have ports.
[00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:31.000]   I actually want to use rather than buy this year's Mac and have to buy a bunch of new
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   cables.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:37.640]   You know, no, there's no sort of obvious improvement in performance in the newer Mac over the over
[00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:39.120]   last year's model.
[00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:43.040]   And it's the same with, you know, it used in the Chrome, the Chromebook pixel that's
[00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:47.040]   three and a half years old does not feel like using a terrible slow machine.
[00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:50.920]   So there's this sort of strange thing that's happened, you know, to computing performance.
[00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:55.600]   It used to be that a three year old device would be, would feel far too slow to use,
[00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:57.520]   but we've hit the threshold of acceptable performance.
[00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:03.000]   But also we've hit the sort of knee in Moore's law where we can't, you know, we're not throwing
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:05.240]   more CPU speed at things anymore.
[00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:07.120]   What we're throwing is more execution units.
[00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:11.680]   And so what matters is how much stuff you're doing in parallel, as opposed to does this
[00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:13.840]   year's model feel that much faster than our Superlend.
[00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:18.880]   You know, it was literally two of the Macs that lots of people saw no reason to buy the
[00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:21.520]   new Mac Pro, MacBook Pro.
[00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:23.560]   And I'm getting the same feeling with this stuff.
[00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:26.720]   And that's going to be a problem for them as they try and sell the phones as well.
[00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:31.880]   Like, you know, the screen technology has got a bit better, but there's not much else
[00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:35.040]   they can point to here and say, this is better than the previous one.
[00:27:35.040 --> 00:27:36.040]   Yep.
[00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:37.440]   That's where we are with all this stuff.
[00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:40.360]   We're waiting, you know, waiting for our new Steve Jobs.
[00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:44.280]   But last year, it was like, well, it's going to be VR and you're going to strap your phone
[00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:46.040]   to your face and everything will be wonderful.
[00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:49.680]   And it's like, yeah, but no.
[00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:53.680]   Zuckerberg thinks, you know, five, ten years from now, that might actually be the case.
[00:27:53.680 --> 00:27:54.680]   And who knows?
[00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:57.480]   Right. But it's hard to say at this point.
[00:27:57.480 --> 00:27:58.480]   Yeah.
[00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:02.720]   So, well, now Jeff, you're so you're using the Pixel C, you say, right?
[00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:05.240]   That's, that's, I mean, that's Android desktop, right?
[00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:06.240]   That's not Chrome.
[00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:07.240]   Oh, that is Android.
[00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:10.040]   No, it's Android, but I'm using a Chrome browser all the time.
[00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:11.360]   Oh, I see what you mean.
[00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:12.360]   Okay.
[00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:13.360]   And I do use apps too, right?
[00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:15.840]   But, but actually I find because here's the thing.
[00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:20.520]   It's interesting because the apps are not rewritten to be able to handle larger sizes.
[00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:25.280]   Like United Airlines, I'm just as well off going to the website, then going to the app
[00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:27.160]   on the privacy.
[00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:32.080]   It's a very good app and I use it on my phone, but the web version is just as good.
[00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:38.240]   It's frustrating when I can't get the large web version of some things through the browser.
[00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:39.240]   That's a problem.
[00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:40.240]   So it's not perfect, right?
[00:28:40.240 --> 00:28:42.880]   But I do note with pleasure and anticipation.
[00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:48.120]   I've never really been in the Samsung, but Samsung now has a new competitor to the Pixel
[00:28:48.120 --> 00:28:49.120]   C.
[00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:51.120]   And I think it's a great thing.
[00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:53.120]   And I think it's a great thing.
[00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:54.120]   And I think it's a great thing.
[00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:55.120]   And I think it's a great thing.
[00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:56.120]   And I think it's a great thing.
[00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:57.120]   And I think it's a great thing.
[00:28:57.120 --> 00:28:58.120]   And I think it's a great thing.
[00:28:58.120 --> 00:28:59.120]   And I think it's a great thing.
[00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:00.120]   And I think it's a great thing.
[00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:01.120]   And I think it's a great thing.
[00:29:01.120 --> 00:29:02.120]   And I think it's a great thing.
[00:29:02.120 --> 00:29:03.120]   And I think it's a great thing.
[00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:04.120]   And I think it's a great thing.
[00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:05.120]   And I think it's a great thing.
[00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:06.120]   And I think it's a great thing.
[00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:07.120]   And I think it's a great thing.
[00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:08.120]   And I think it's a great thing.
[00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:09.120]   And I think it's a great thing.
[00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:10.120]   And I think it's a great thing.
[00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:11.120]   And I think it's a great thing.
[00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:12.120]   And I think it's a great thing.
[00:29:12.120 --> 00:29:13.120]   And I think it's a great thing.
[00:29:13.120 --> 00:29:14.120]   And I think it's a great thing.
[00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:15.120]   And I think it's a great thing.
[00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:16.120]   And I think it's a great thing.
[00:29:16.120 --> 00:29:17.120]   And I think it's a great thing.
[00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:18.120]   And I think it's a great thing.
[00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:19.120]   And I think it's a great thing.
[00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:20.120]   And I think it's a great thing.
[00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:21.120]   And I think it's a great thing.
[00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:22.120]   And I think it's a great thing.
[00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:23.120]   And I think it's a great thing.
[00:29:23.120 --> 00:29:24.120]   And I think it's a great thing.
[00:29:24.120 --> 00:29:25.120]   And I think it's a great thing.
[00:29:25.120 --> 00:29:26.120]   And I think it's a great thing.
[00:29:26.120 --> 00:29:27.120]   And I think it's a great thing.
[00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:28.120]   And I think it's a great thing.
[00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:29.120]   And I think it's a great thing.
[00:29:29.120 --> 00:29:30.120]   And I think it's a great thing.
[00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:31.120]   And I think it's a great thing.
[00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:32.120]   And I think it's a great thing.
[00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:33.120]   And I think it's a great thing.
[00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:34.120]   And I think it's a great thing.
[00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:35.120]   And I think it's a great thing.
[00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:36.120]   And I think it's a great thing.
[00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:37.120]   And I think it's a great thing.
[00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:38.120]   And I think it's a great thing.
[00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:39.120]   And I think it's a great thing.
[00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:40.120]   And I think it's a great thing.
[00:29:40.120 --> 00:29:41.120]   And I think it's a great thing.
[00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:42.120]   And I think it's a great thing.
[00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:43.120]   And I think it's a great thing.
[00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:44.120]   And I think it's a great thing.
[00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:45.120]   And I think it's a great thing.
[00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:46.120]   And I think it's a great thing.
[00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:47.120]   And I think it's a great thing.
[00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:48.120]   And I think it's a great thing.
[00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:49.120]   And I think it's a great thing.
[00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:50.120]   And I think it's a great thing.
[00:29:50.120 --> 00:29:51.120]   And I think it's a great thing.
[00:29:51.120 --> 00:29:52.120]   And I think it's a great thing.
[00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:53.120]   And I think it's a great thing.
[00:29:53.120 --> 00:29:54.120]   And I think it's a great thing.
[00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:55.120]   And I think it's a great thing.
[00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:56.120]   And I think it's a great thing.
[00:29:56.120 --> 00:29:57.120]   And I think it's a great thing.
[00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:58.120]   And I think it's a great thing.
[00:29:58.120 --> 00:29:59.120]   And I think it's a great thing.
[00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:00.120]   And I think it's a great thing.
[00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:01.120]   And I think it's a great thing.
[00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:02.120]   And I think it's a great thing.
[00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:03.120]   And I think it's a great thing.
[00:30:03.120 --> 00:30:04.120]   And I think it's a great thing.
[00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:05.120]   And I think it's a great thing.
[00:30:05.120 --> 00:30:06.120]   And I think it's a great thing.
[00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:07.120]   And I think it's a great thing.
[00:30:07.120 --> 00:30:08.120]   And I think it's a great thing.
[00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:09.120]   And I think it's a great thing.
[00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:10.120]   And I think it's a great thing.
[00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:11.120]   And I think it's a great thing.
[00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:13.120]   That was my annoyance here.
[00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:16.120]   So I've got good broadband in the UK here.
[00:30:16.120 --> 00:30:17.120]   It's Virginia media.
[00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:20.120]   But when it drops out, they don't drop it properly.
[00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:25.120]   They serve a web page from the Wi-Fi hub saying, we're having
[00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:26.120]   job with your connection.
[00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:28.120]   And they're man in the middle of your web connections with that.
[00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:31.120]   So that my phone, which would quite happen to switch over to
[00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:34.120]   4G and I wouldn't notice, suddenly behaves really weirdly.
[00:30:34.120 --> 00:30:37.120]   Because all the web connections have turned into spurious web pages
[00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:40.120]   that are from the local Wi-Fi router, which is really annoying.
[00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:41.120]   That is super annoying.
[00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:44.120]   Let the smart devices be smart.
[00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:48.120]   It's like, stop overthinking this, Ruta.
[00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:49.120]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:54.120]   No, so you were talking about the Galaxy Tab S3, Jeff.
[00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:58.120]   We actually, Florence Ion on last night's all about Android kind of
[00:30:58.120 --> 00:31:00.120]   dove into that in detail.
[00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:01.120]   She's been playing around with it.
[00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:02.120]   She says, it's really nice.
[00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:04.120]   The S Pen is an awesome touch.
[00:31:04.120 --> 00:31:09.120]   Yeah, it really kind of seems like the, maybe the next step for
[00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:14.120]   the Google Pixel C fan that wants something a little bit newer,
[00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:19.120]   a little bit, I don't know, kind of in the same kind of premium ballpark.
[00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:21.120]   Apparently it's pretty nice.
[00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:22.120]   I don't know.
[00:31:22.120 --> 00:31:24.120]   I haven't seen it in person and I'll see it next week.
[00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:29.120]   I just, I commend you for living your life on the Pixel C because I, man,
[00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:33.120]   I had tried to have the keyboard attachment for it.
[00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:36.120]   I think it's probably the kind of thing you just have to devote yourself
[00:31:36.120 --> 00:31:37.120]   to do and then eventually--
[00:31:37.120 --> 00:31:38.120]   Here's the key.
[00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:39.120]   No, here's the key.
[00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:41.120]   I do not live my life on it.
[00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:42.120]   Okay.
[00:31:42.120 --> 00:31:47.120]   When I travel, I will live up to a week on it and it works.
[00:31:47.120 --> 00:31:49.120]   The worst time is trying to get on Twig.
[00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:50.120]   Yeah.
[00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:54.120]   And there are, you know, there are few frustrations.
[00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:59.120]   But generally for what I want to do, not, you know, losing two pounds in
[00:31:59.120 --> 00:32:01.120]   my briefcase is have right.
[00:32:01.120 --> 00:32:02.120]   Yeah.
[00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:05.120]   Yeah, it's a big trade off there.
[00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:10.120]   Real quick on the end of kind of the, you know, wrapping up what else
[00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:11.120]   Samsung had.
[00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:16.120]   They have a Google Wi-Fi clone or kind of router based similar to Google
[00:32:16.120 --> 00:32:19.120]   Wi-Fi called Samsung Connect Home.
[00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:22.120]   It's, you know, your Wi-Fi router, smart Wi-Fi router that you can
[00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:23.120]   control from an app.
[00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:29.120]   It also has smart things and IoT smarts baked into it so it can be
[00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:33.120]   your IoT hub for, gosh, I think it was Bixby.
[00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:34.120]   No, sorry.
[00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:35.120]   Sorry.
[00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:36.120]   Not Bixby.
[00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:37.120]   That's something else.
[00:32:37.120 --> 00:32:38.120]   Zigby and Z-Wave.
[00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:39.120]   Zigby.
[00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:44.120]   Bixby is Samsung's proprietary digital assistant, by the way, which they now
[00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:45.120]   have.
[00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:46.120]   That was another announcement.
[00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:50.120]   But anyway, so there's, there's, because Samsung loves to do that,
[00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:51.120]   right?
[00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:53.120]   You've got these things that you're already using.
[00:32:53.120 --> 00:32:54.120]   We've got ours now too.
[00:32:54.120 --> 00:32:55.120]   You should use it.
[00:32:55.120 --> 00:32:57.120]   Well, that's the other reason to not buy Samsung devices.
[00:32:57.120 --> 00:33:02.120]   Like now I have 20 copies of all the apps that I already have and I've
[00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:04.120]   got to try and turn those off when I can't.
[00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:09.120]   What Samsung did with this is in the S8, they have a dedicated button on
[00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:14.120]   the side of the phone to summon Bixby, which I have to imagine they had to do,
[00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:17.120]   because otherwise people might not remember to ever use it.
[00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:20.120]   If there's a dedicated button, they'd be more inclined to remember that that
[00:33:20.120 --> 00:33:21.120]   button goes to Bixby.
[00:33:21.120 --> 00:33:24.120]   But you have to ask yourself, like, why use this versus, you know,
[00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:29.120]   assistant or any other number of digital assistants that are, that are on these
[00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:32.120]   devices by default, thanks to their agreement with Google.
[00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:36.120]   So do you think, do you think the assistants will become free of their
[00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:39.120]   platforms that even on Android device, I'll be able to use Siri?
[00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:41.120]   Is that going to be their business benefit at any point?
[00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:44.120]   Or is it so tied as just an extra benefit?
[00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:45.120]   There's no business model for it.
[00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:47.120]   So you've got to tie it to the hardware.
[00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:48.120]   That's a really good question.
[00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:49.120]   Well, Siri's a weird one.
[00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:51.120]   I can't see how we're doing that.
[00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:53.120]   I couldn't see that either.
[00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:56.120]   Alexa, you can run on Android, I think.
[00:33:56.120 --> 00:33:59.120]   Well, you can on certain Android devices.
[00:33:59.120 --> 00:34:02.120]   And as you see here, Cortana is available, of course.
[00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:03.120]   Microsoft makes Cortana.
[00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:06.120]   So I mean, in some ways they are available.
[00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:08.120]   So I can use Cortana on my phone?
[00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:09.120]   Yeah, you could.
[00:34:09.120 --> 00:34:10.120]   Yep.
[00:34:10.120 --> 00:34:11.120]   Just install that app.
[00:34:11.120 --> 00:34:12.120]   Oh, I didn't know that.
[00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:16.120]   And it's a little different from Windows 10 mobile in the sense that, you know,
[00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:21.120]   on Windows 10 mobile, Cortana has more access to the underlying layers of the phone.
[00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:27.120]   In the same way that on Android devices, Assistant, especially on the Pixel,
[00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:32.120]   as one example, Assistant has more hooks, I think, on the underlying, you know,
[00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:37.120]   operations of an Android device than maybe a third party one would have,
[00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:38.120]   because it's Google.
[00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:41.120]   But yeah, you can install Cortana.
[00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:45.120]   And they even have, you know, brought it as you see here to the lock screen,
[00:34:45.120 --> 00:34:50.120]   so you can summon it from there, removing kind of an element, kind of a step
[00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:51.120]   to get there.
[00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:58.120]   So, yeah, I couldn't see Siri doing that though, or Apple doing that with Siri.
[00:34:58.120 --> 00:35:05.120]   But I mean, Bixby Samsung's offering actually is related to Siri in the sense that it was,
[00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:08.120]   it was partially the result of what is it?
[00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:15.120]   Viv Samsung acquired Viv back last year, and Viv was created by some of the people
[00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:16.120]   who created Siri.
[00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:19.120]   So, it's very incestuous.
[00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:24.120]   It's all coming together as far as that's concerned.
[00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:29.120]   And then New Gear VR, I already mentioned that, New Gear 360 spherical camera,
[00:35:29.120 --> 00:35:34.120]   they updated that for full 4K, I guess the previous version was like 90% 4K,
[00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:35.120]   apparently.
[00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:40.120]   Now it's full 4K, they also redesigned it, so they took away the kind of tripod
[00:35:40.120 --> 00:35:44.120]   legs, and they moved the battery down in that base, so it allows for the spherical
[00:35:44.120 --> 00:35:46.120]   camera to be able to get it.
[00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:49.120]   I'm not sure how much I like, I'm not sure how much I like, but the sphere was neat
[00:35:49.120 --> 00:35:51.120]   because it could go on any tripod.
[00:35:51.120 --> 00:35:56.120]   Yeah, exactly, that's one of my fears, my complaint is that you could unscrew that
[00:35:56.120 --> 00:36:00.120]   sphere and put it on anything, put it on the top of your snowboarding helmet, for example,
[00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:05.120]   or whatever, and a little bit more flexible, this one's a little bit more locked down.
[00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:10.120]   What's the, on that, there's a window on the handle, do you know what that is?
[00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:15.120]   That's correct.
[00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:16.120]   Down to the bottom.
[00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:18.120]   Around thing in the bottom, yeah.
[00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:23.120]   Well, on the Gear 360, on the first version, there was a display, I believe there's a
[00:36:23.120 --> 00:36:26.120]   display on the top, and that's just your digital readout of those.
[00:36:26.120 --> 00:36:27.120]   Yes, there was.
[00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:31.120]   Yeah, that's my guess anyways, I haven't seen that in operation, but I'm guessing that's probably
[00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:33.120]   where they moved that, that would make sense.
[00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:39.120]   And it supports live broadcast, so, which, by the way, Facebook unleashed,
[00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:46.120]   fully, today, the ability to live stream 360 degree video content.
[00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:52.120]   This is going to tie into that, also into live streaming to YouTube, to the Samsung Gear
[00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:57.120]   VR, so you're going to be able to use this to live stream in real time.
[00:36:57.120 --> 00:37:01.120]   360 degree video, which is pretty neat.
[00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:09.120]   So, you know, when you get your front seat at the Bruce Springsteen concert, or wherever
[00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:14.120]   you go on, you know, bring it 360, and everyone else can see it too.
[00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:18.120]   You probably shouldn't do that, that's probably against the rules.
[00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:25.120]   But anyways, we're probably going to get those, a device or two in-house to kind of spend some
[00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:27.120]   time with and review on the show.
[00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:28.120]   I'm sure Leo's getting one.
[00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:32.120]   I have to imagine Leo's going to get one, and you're going to see it here in a few weeks.
[00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:33.120]   Yeah.
[00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:35.120]   Nice looking device.
[00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:36.120]   I like it.
[00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:43.120]   Oh, and real quick, before we get to our sponsor read, I should just also mention that Samsung
[00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:47.120]   is going to be refurbishing Note 7s.
[00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:52.120]   So, they're going to be re-issuing the Note 7 stock that they had claimed from all of the
[00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:53.120]   battery explosions.
[00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:59.120]   So, they're going to re-release it to certain markets as a refurbished device or rental
[00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:00.120]   devices.
[00:38:00.120 --> 00:38:02.120]   It's not coming to the US though.
[00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:07.120]   But they're instead of just throwing this all, you know, in the ground, a la Atari.
[00:38:07.120 --> 00:38:13.120]   They're going to put it to some use again and give it new life, which I think is the right
[00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:14.120]   move.
[00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:16.120]   So, good stuff.
[00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:18.120]   All things Samsung.
[00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:25.120]   Let's take a quick break and thank the sponsor of today's episode of This Week in Google.
[00:38:25.120 --> 00:38:26.120]   That's Nature Box.
[00:38:26.120 --> 00:38:31.120]   This is probably the part where a lot of you are going to get super hungry because I've
[00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:38.120]   got a Nature Box right here full of delicious snacks that I'm not going to eat right now
[00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:41.120]   because I want to be able to actually, you know, read and talk.
[00:38:41.120 --> 00:38:47.120]   But I'm tempted because a peanut butter gram jam sounds pretty delicious right about now.
[00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:48.920]   What do you do when you want to snack?
[00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:52.240]   But all you find is junk food everywhere you look.
[00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:57.000]   You rely on your self-control to resist the temptation.
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   Don't go there.
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:02.360]   You eat the junk food though anyways and that probably doesn't feel very good.
[00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:05.720]   Well, now you can start snacking healthy with Nature Box.
[00:39:05.720 --> 00:39:10.520]   Nature Box makes snacks that actually taste great and are better for you.
[00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:15.160]   They're created with high quality ingredients that are free from artificial colors, flavors
[00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:16.160]   or sweeteners.
[00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:20.240]   So you can feel great about snacking.
[00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:22.920]   I've actually had the peanut butter gram jams.
[00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:24.840]   Those are delicious.
[00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:30.080]   There's also in this box in particular a blueberry almond quinoa bites.
[00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:36.760]   And over time I've realized they must have someone who enjoys the position of naming all
[00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:41.920]   of their snacks in ways that make you salivate nutty power clusters.
[00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:43.600]   Zesty nacho curls.
[00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:48.280]   I don't know if they do a good job naming their snacks and they're as delicious as their names
[00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:49.280]   imply.
[00:39:49.280 --> 00:39:52.840]   Nature Box recently made their service even better.
[00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:56.040]   Now you can order as much as you want as often as you want.
[00:39:56.040 --> 00:40:00.640]   No minimum purchase is required and you cancel anytime.
[00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:02.200]   So it's super simple.
[00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:04.440]   You just go to naturebox.com.
[00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:06.400]   You can check out their snack catalog.
[00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:07.400]   It's dense.
[00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:09.480]   There's a lot of stuff on that snack catalog.
[00:40:09.480 --> 00:40:12.120]   There are over 100 snacks to choose from.
[00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:15.960]   They're constantly adding delicious new snacks to that list.
[00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:19.960]   You can choose the snacks that you want and then they'll deliver them right to your door.
[00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:21.400]   It just comes in a box.
[00:40:21.400 --> 00:40:22.880]   Open it up and get to snacking.
[00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:24.600]   With naturebox you'll never get bored.
[00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:29.760]   There are new snacks every month inspired by your feedback, by customer feedback.
[00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:32.520]   You can give them a great idea and it might end up as a snack.
[00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:38.000]   If you ever try a snack you don't like, nature box will replace it for free.
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:39.680]   Right now you'll save even more.
[00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:48.680]   Nature Box is offering our fans 50% off your first order when you go to naturebox.com/twit.
[00:40:48.680 --> 00:40:52.220]   So it's your time to get to snacking with naturebox.
[00:40:52.220 --> 00:41:00.080]   That's naturebox.com/twit for 50% off your first order and we thank nature box for their
[00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:04.480]   support of this week in Google.
[00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:13.120]   Let's see here, we got some googly news starting with a bunch of messaging related moves tied
[00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:14.680]   in with G Suite.
[00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:20.600]   It's like Google is taking their messaging ship apart piece by piece and repurposing
[00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:26.240]   pieces and different apps and it's not confusing at all.
[00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:29.360]   Google Talk apparently is dead as of June 26th.
[00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:31.840]   It's going to be end of life.
[00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:36.120]   It's the chat that you're used to seeing in Gmail if you're still using Gmail and not
[00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:39.640]   inbox and they're going to be replacing it with Hangouts.
[00:41:39.640 --> 00:41:46.160]   I think this was kind of expected at some point that they would get rid of Google Talk.
[00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:47.160]   Its days were numbered.
[00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:51.640]   Is it still to be a sidebar or that we can have to go to another tab?
[00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:54.360]   I think it's going to be a Hangouts window as far as I can tell.
[00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:59.440]   Kind of similar to what you're seeing with Google Talk.
[00:41:59.440 --> 00:42:04.600]   But yeah, actually that's a good question because in inbox it is a sidebar.
[00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:08.160]   It occupies the side of the screen instead of being that little.
[00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:13.320]   Right now I think that's an issue but it was very convenient to have it there.
[00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:14.840]   I would agree.
[00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:18.600]   Also Hangouts on Android is going to kill SMS functionality.
[00:42:18.600 --> 00:42:20.560]   That's happening on May 22nd.
[00:42:20.560 --> 00:42:22.400]   I'm hearing screams in the studio.
[00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:26.080]   I don't know how do you guys feel about this?
[00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:28.280]   Have you moved on from SMS inside Hangouts?
[00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:33.400]   I'm still kind of locked into that world and I realize I need to jump ship.
[00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:36.000]   I forget what I'm using now.
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:38.200]   I'm using Google Messenger now.
[00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:39.200]   Yeah.
[00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:41.280]   I'm tempted to switch to...
[00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:42.280]   Messages you need.
[00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:43.280]   Yeah.
[00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:45.600]   Android messages or whatever they're calling it this week.
[00:42:45.600 --> 00:42:49.080]   It was good messenger for a while and then they realized that that just meant people would
[00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:53.280]   download the Facebook one instead because Facebook made that one do SMS funny.
[00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:54.280]   Yeah.
[00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:55.280]   Yeah.
[00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:59.480]   I know I should probably switch over to Android messages.
[00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:00.880]   I just can't keep it all straight.
[00:43:00.880 --> 00:43:01.880]   It's so confusing.
[00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:04.920]   No, this is what we do for a living and I can't keep it all straight.
[00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:07.240]   How is anybody else going to keep it all straight?
[00:43:07.240 --> 00:43:08.240]   So confusing.
[00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:12.920]   No, I mean, it was grumbling about Samsung making a spare copy of every app but Google
[00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:15.960]   has made five of these damn things and it's really annoying.
[00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:16.960]   Yeah.
[00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:17.960]   Yeah.
[00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:18.960]   Keeps it.
[00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:24.040]   And particularly going from the US to the UK and it's like, okay, I would like to actually
[00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:29.120]   bridge all these things into one place and Google Voice used to kind of do that but
[00:43:29.120 --> 00:43:33.000]   I'm still not quite sure if it's going to ever work and I'm not sure when they shake
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:36.440]   all the pieces and then steal them out, steal the cards out again whether I'll be able
[00:43:36.440 --> 00:43:42.120]   to bridge Google Voice from my old US account to my UK phone number.
[00:43:42.120 --> 00:43:49.640]   Signal, which I've thought was great, is tied to your voice ID, which is really stupid.
[00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:53.640]   What's that kind of has a way to do it but then it gets really grumpy when you do do it.
[00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:58.200]   So, and I think one of the Google things, is it Aloe or duo?
[00:43:58.200 --> 00:44:03.240]   Aloe, I think, is tied to phone numbers as well and it's like, why are you making me
[00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:09.080]   buy a sim from another company to generate an ID?
[00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:13.720]   How is that a better answer than using an online ID?
[00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:15.880]   How do we get trapped in this place?
[00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:16.880]   Hm.
[00:44:16.880 --> 00:44:17.880]   Anyways.
[00:44:17.880 --> 00:44:18.880]   How do you imagine?
[00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:22.960]   How do they unload there?
[00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:30.200]   They ended up there because, well, the other thing that Google has very badly wrong is that
[00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:35.000]   they base ID on email and that's baked so deeply into the Google ID system that they
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:37.360]   can't fix it.
[00:44:37.360 --> 00:44:42.720]   So, and they've had four go's at replacing it and it's never really, really stuck.
[00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:45.560]   So basically when you sign up for Google account you have to have an email and I think
[00:44:45.560 --> 00:44:49.640]   some product managers who decided to get frustrated with this because they work in markets with
[00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:53.000]   people who don't have emails and they won't go for the process to sign up for them.
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:57.320]   And so that's how we ended up with Aloe where they're doing it on phone numbers again because
[00:44:57.320 --> 00:45:01.400]   they're trying to sell it to India and markets that are sim based.
[00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:03.880]   And that was the sort of the inside of what's that pad.
[00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:07.520]   It was like, oh, people don't have email addresses, they have phone numbers, let's bootstrap
[00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:09.360]   everything off the phone number system.
[00:45:09.360 --> 00:45:16.040]   Which kind of works but I need the infrastructure where my phone has two sims which doesn't
[00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:17.440]   happen in Western phones.
[00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:23.200]   So, I'm stuck with keeping my old phone sort of half alive so that I can get the US SMS
[00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:28.320]   is on that one and the UK SMS is on this one and actually I'd rather bridge it properly.
[00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:32.880]   And this is like, it's just a deep identity failure.
[00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:37.080]   And okay, now I'm going to have, no, you've got me my Google identity run.
[00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:41.720]   But the other thing is really frustrating about Google identity.
[00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:46.560]   And oh, well, this is a very Jeff complaint which is that I've used Google to register
[00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:48.480]   domains because it used to be really easy.
[00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:53.760]   You used to Google.com/a and you could register domains and it was part of Google.
[00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:57.320]   That's for your domain but you could just make domains there and then you could make
[00:45:57.320 --> 00:46:00.680]   a site or an app engine thing or correct domains.
[00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:03.800]   And they would also renew and they'd use your credit card, everything would be fine.
[00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:09.440]   So, I have a domain habit by domains and sort of forget about them.
[00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:15.160]   And suddenly G Suite is insisting that you log in to the Gmail account that belongs to
[00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:17.600]   that domain to renew it.
[00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:21.840]   And I've got a bunch of domains that don't have accounts because I just make domains.
[00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:27.280]   And then I have apps on them or I have static pages or I have something on them.
[00:46:27.280 --> 00:46:28.800]   But now I can't renew them.
[00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:32.400]   G Suite just completely fails to renew them.
[00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:38.520]   So I've, and in some ways, this is a good thing in that it's half of them are stupid
[00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:42.640]   domains that I bought 10 years ago and have done anything sensible with.
[00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:45.000]   But there are a couple of them that come up with you on that.
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:49.720]   It's like, I don't actually, I cannot get through your process to renew this Google
[00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:56.160]   because you're expecting to log in with an email from that domain that I never created.
[00:46:56.160 --> 00:46:59.400]   And when I try and do that, I just get a series of 400 hours and it fails.
[00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:05.600]   So, I think these are the ones that they outsource a registration to GoDaddy or Enom
[00:47:05.600 --> 00:47:06.600]   or somebody.
[00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:10.240]   So I'm going to have to go and get on the phone with GoDaddy and Enom and try and get
[00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:12.880]   them to reroute the domain for me.
[00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:20.480]   But it's, yeah, it's this sort of, it's the root cause is this strange focus on email
[00:47:20.480 --> 00:47:24.480]   that is at the heart of Google's identity system, which they've been sort of trying
[00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:27.960]   to fix for at least 10 years and never quite managed to do so.
[00:47:27.960 --> 00:47:30.800]   And the phone number thing is a symptom of that as well.
[00:47:30.800 --> 00:47:34.720]   It's like, oh, we've done, we're doing identity through phone numbers.
[00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:37.960]   But we can't, once we've decided that's what we're doing, that means you can't actually
[00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:43.640]   move between countries in a reliable way at all.
[00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:50.760]   Hearing you detail that just gave me, gave me nightmarish, I don't know, I just started
[00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:55.160]   remembering the time I was on this week in Google and locked myself out of my own account
[00:47:55.160 --> 00:47:56.160]   because of the Google voice.
[00:47:56.160 --> 00:47:58.640]   That was the best, maybe the best show ever.
[00:47:58.640 --> 00:48:00.880]   I mean, and it's kind of the same thing, right?
[00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:05.040]   Like I need the thing to do the thing, but I can't get the thing because I need the thing.
[00:48:05.040 --> 00:48:06.040]   Right.
[00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:07.960]   Yeah, that's a nightmare.
[00:48:07.960 --> 00:48:10.320]   I mean, and you said it right there.
[00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:13.960]   You said, you know, the Google's been, it has taken 10 years to try and get it right
[00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:15.800]   and just not quite there.
[00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:19.280]   And man, isn't that indicative of so many things coming from Google?
[00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:23.000]   I feel like, and I hate to say that because I'm such a huge fan, but I mean, you know,
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:29.160]   that identity messaging, I mean, it's this, this like constant struggle and confusion
[00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:33.480]   around like, why is this such a challenge?
[00:48:33.480 --> 00:48:34.640]   And yet it's so important.
[00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:35.640]   It just doesn't.
[00:48:35.640 --> 00:48:36.640]   Well, it is hard.
[00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:39.120]   You know, I'm not saying it's an easy problem.
[00:48:39.120 --> 00:48:40.120]   I understand.
[00:48:40.120 --> 00:48:41.120]   But it's cool.
[00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:43.360]   Like, they should be able to get it right down.
[00:48:43.360 --> 00:48:44.360]   I don't know.
[00:48:44.360 --> 00:48:45.960]   Maybe I get too much credit.
[00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:52.240]   No, but it's, I mean, I think it's partly because Google is in some ways that everybody
[00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:55.760]   structure to be a bit chaotic so that they can encourage people to make new products to
[00:48:55.760 --> 00:49:01.440]   try and not start for innovation by imposing a strategy tax on people.
[00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:05.240]   Whereas, you know, Facebook had to buy another company to do that.
[00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:07.800]   You know, Facebook, and then they learned that, oh, you can log in to Facebook with
[00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:12.800]   a phone number or an email and we'll create an identity bridge between them.
[00:49:12.800 --> 00:49:18.400]   Whereas for Google, they went down a rabbit hole with Google+, and I suspect my feeling
[00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:25.120]   is that Google+, now is like IE was in Microsoft for about five years where nobody wanted to
[00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:29.560]   touch it because it had such a sort of toxic waste sign hanging around its next.
[00:49:29.560 --> 00:49:33.040]   And so we're stuck with this, like, you know, they're gradually unpicking it.
[00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:36.600]   They're pulling pieces off bit by bit and they're trying to make sense of it.
[00:49:36.600 --> 00:49:40.600]   But it's a structural problem they have that they're trying to resolve.
[00:49:40.600 --> 00:49:46.360]   And in the meantime, we're sitting here going, okay, so I have to pay an American phone company
[00:49:46.360 --> 00:49:53.720]   and a British phone company to keep these things going, even though you have a soft
[00:49:53.720 --> 00:49:58.640]   telco wrapped inside Google Voice, which has been sitting there sort of mostly working
[00:49:58.640 --> 00:50:00.840]   for 10 years now.
[00:50:00.840 --> 00:50:05.680]   Yet somehow the ability to migrate phone numbers into it and went away at some point, probably
[00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:09.000]   because the guys who founded it and left and Google doesn't understand phones anymore
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:10.000]   or something.
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:15.680]   But it's one of these, this identity problem is a hard problem.
[00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:18.880]   And there are ways to fix it by thinking carefully about it.
[00:50:18.880 --> 00:50:25.120]   But in practice, you end up defaulting to something and Google defaults to email and then what's
[00:50:25.120 --> 00:50:29.320]   up defaults to phone numbers and neither of those are ideal.
[00:50:29.320 --> 00:50:34.560]   And there are ways to abstract this better, but they haven't solved it yet.
[00:50:34.560 --> 00:50:37.640]   And it frustrates me all the time.
[00:50:37.640 --> 00:50:42.360]   And you would say that WhatsApp suffers from the same, I mean, it's the same technological
[00:50:42.360 --> 00:50:48.120]   issue, but WhatsApp suffers from the same problem that that Alo suffers from.
[00:50:48.120 --> 00:50:53.840]   But WhatsApp is not having a problem, you know, in this, in the world of messaging.
[00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:55.920]   They are raining supreme as far as that's concerned.
[00:50:55.920 --> 00:50:59.240]   Why is it working for WhatsApp and it's not working for Alo?
[00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:03.120]   Well I don't use WhatsApp much.
[00:51:03.120 --> 00:51:08.360]   But what's WhatsApp bootstrapped itself on phone numbers and spent the time in countries
[00:51:08.360 --> 00:51:10.280]   where you can have multiple sims.
[00:51:10.280 --> 00:51:12.440]   So worked out a way to bridge it.
[00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:17.560]   Whereas the Google stuff I think is this very American, nobody ever changes a sim world
[00:51:17.560 --> 00:51:19.040]   view.
[00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:21.640]   And so they're sort of, they're stuck in that corner.
[00:51:21.640 --> 00:51:26.120]   Whereas WhatsApp, you know, I was able to migrate to this to this phone with WhatsApp.
[00:51:26.120 --> 00:51:29.360]   And it was a bit cumbersome, partly because the encryption stuff.
[00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:35.920]   So you basically have to send an SMS to your old phone and have that working and then type
[00:51:35.920 --> 00:51:39.600]   the number in from that one on this phone and then it will wake itself up and download
[00:51:39.600 --> 00:51:42.280]   and encrypt your first things and you've got your message archive.
[00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:43.960]   And then I think it's bridging the chats.
[00:51:43.960 --> 00:51:48.360]   I'm not, you know, I think it's using my old phone number on this new phone for my WhatsApp
[00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:50.320]   connections, it seems to be.
[00:51:50.320 --> 00:51:53.760]   But the signal completely failed to do that.
[00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:56.440]   Signal was like, no, you've just got to tell your friends you're a new phone number.
[00:51:56.440 --> 00:52:02.000]   And it's like, that's not actually helpful when I have, you know, 18 years worth of phone
[00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:04.000]   contacts in the old thing.
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:08.520]   And I don't actually want to send a giant SMS to all of them saying, hi, I've changed
[00:52:08.520 --> 00:52:09.800]   my phone number.
[00:52:09.800 --> 00:52:10.800]   Please contact me this way.
[00:52:10.800 --> 00:52:15.360]   The point of using Signal was supposed to be, I've switched to a very secure thing that's
[00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:16.360]   the send to end.
[00:52:16.360 --> 00:52:20.200]   And suddenly it's like, oh, no, but I've got a, I've, and, you know, they're, they're
[00:52:20.200 --> 00:52:21.200]   Russian on as well.
[00:52:21.200 --> 00:52:23.640]   It's like, we're trying to make this easy for people to use SMS.
[00:52:23.640 --> 00:52:28.160]   It's like, yeah, but you could actually make it easy in these other ways too.
[00:52:28.160 --> 00:52:29.160]   Right.
[00:52:29.160 --> 00:52:30.920]   With just a little bit of abstraction.
[00:52:30.920 --> 00:52:31.920]   Yeah.
[00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:32.920]   Yeah.
[00:52:32.920 --> 00:52:38.600]   And you're talking about removing, peeling things back out of Google+, that continues
[00:52:38.600 --> 00:52:45.640]   Google removed location sharing from Google+, and this was a feature that I've used actually
[00:52:45.640 --> 00:52:46.640]   quite a bit.
[00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:50.920]   My wife and I actually use it because, you know, with a family and my wife working in San
[00:52:50.920 --> 00:52:55.520]   Francisco and me being up here and commute and all that kind of stuff, it's really good
[00:52:55.520 --> 00:52:58.880]   to know like if somebody's on the route or where they're at or whatever.
[00:52:58.880 --> 00:53:03.680]   So we know when we get back up, because let me tell you, when you, when you've got a family,
[00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:06.840]   back up is definitely appreciated.
[00:53:06.840 --> 00:53:09.640]   And so removing it from Google+, was a big bummer.
[00:53:09.640 --> 00:53:15.120]   While it turns out it's being folded into maps, you may remember latitude of days, you
[00:53:15.120 --> 00:53:17.080]   know, gone by.
[00:53:17.080 --> 00:53:21.000]   It's basically latitude-ish features coming back into maps.
[00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:28.200]   I just got the update this morning that allows me to send to grant either temporary or permanent
[00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:33.640]   location sharing of where I'm at with a select contact and then inside the maps app, they
[00:53:33.640 --> 00:53:35.200]   can track that from there.
[00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:38.360]   Honestly, this is a feature that always belonged in maps.
[00:53:38.360 --> 00:53:40.360]   It was strange that it ended up in Google+.
[00:53:40.360 --> 00:53:41.360]   Yes.
[00:53:41.360 --> 00:53:42.360]   But there we go.
[00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:48.760]   You know, well, I still remember dodgeball, so that's how it goes back.
[00:53:48.760 --> 00:53:54.720]   But latitude made sense, made sense in maps and it worked in maps.
[00:53:54.720 --> 00:53:58.240]   And then they put it in plus because everything was being put in plus, it was social feature,
[00:53:58.240 --> 00:54:00.080]   blah, blah, blah.
[00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:05.080]   Except that there was some actually quite nice features of this, which was you could put
[00:54:05.080 --> 00:54:09.320]   widgets on the desktop to show you where your family was, which was actually really useful.
[00:54:09.320 --> 00:54:13.680]   And I don't know if I can do that with a maps version yet, but also I've got to like,
[00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:17.520]   because they didn't transition this well, all those widgets died.
[00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:19.160]   The Google location thing died.
[00:54:19.160 --> 00:54:23.480]   I've now got to go and talk to my family and say, "Okay, let me walk you through the six
[00:54:23.480 --> 00:54:27.320]   step process of sharing your location with me again."
[00:54:27.320 --> 00:54:31.200]   And you know, it's like the transition has not been handled well, especially killing it,
[00:54:31.200 --> 00:54:33.360]   killing the old version before the new version was available.
[00:54:33.360 --> 00:54:35.160]   But I agree with the basic premise.
[00:54:35.160 --> 00:54:40.640]   It did belong in maps, it makes a lot of sense being in maps.
[00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:43.680]   Do they have the navigate to this person thing back?
[00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:45.440]   Because that was the other great thing about latitude.
[00:54:45.440 --> 00:54:49.720]   When it was in maps, you can see where your friends were and say, "Take me to where Jeff
[00:54:49.720 --> 00:54:50.720]   is."
[00:54:50.720 --> 00:54:56.480]   And if Jeff moved, then the nav would update to help you chase Jeff around, which is really
[00:54:56.480 --> 00:54:57.480]   useful.
[00:54:57.480 --> 00:55:01.040]   That's a really good question.
[00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:02.040]   I don't know.
[00:55:02.040 --> 00:55:04.600]   All I've done yet is share my location with her wife.
[00:55:04.600 --> 00:55:06.320]   She has not shared with me yet.
[00:55:06.320 --> 00:55:07.720]   I need to show her how to do that tonight.
[00:55:07.720 --> 00:55:09.680]   Then I'll be able to find out if you can actually do that.
[00:55:09.680 --> 00:55:10.680]   That was very useful.
[00:55:10.680 --> 00:55:12.520]   Because then it's like, "I know where you're at.
[00:55:12.520 --> 00:55:13.520]   Let's meet up.
[00:55:13.520 --> 00:55:14.520]   You don't need to tell me.
[00:55:14.520 --> 00:55:15.520]   I already know."
[00:55:15.520 --> 00:55:17.520]   And just go there.
[00:55:17.520 --> 00:55:18.520]   Yep.
[00:55:18.520 --> 00:55:24.680]   So that, you know, and it is that, and the thing is, it was also very weird because I
[00:55:24.680 --> 00:55:29.320]   by latitude group was grandfathering to my plus group or something.
[00:55:29.320 --> 00:55:35.080]   So I had Leo's location and random Google execs location and things like that because
[00:55:35.080 --> 00:55:38.360]   people who signed up for latitude at the same time as me and shared locations forgot
[00:55:38.360 --> 00:55:39.360]   they were doing it.
[00:55:39.360 --> 00:55:43.000]   And then Google+ picked that up and the press was still there.
[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:44.200]   So that was a bit weird.
[00:55:44.200 --> 00:55:45.200]   So I love the space.
[00:55:45.200 --> 00:55:47.200]   I love you.
[00:55:47.200 --> 00:55:49.720]   You've got mine now.
[00:55:49.720 --> 00:55:50.720]   I love Britain.
[00:55:50.720 --> 00:55:53.480]   Oh, they're so great.
[00:55:53.480 --> 00:55:56.280]   One street's just called the avenue.
[00:55:56.280 --> 00:55:57.280]   Right.
[00:55:57.280 --> 00:56:00.240]   It's a certain hubris.
[00:56:00.240 --> 00:56:03.080]   It's the avenue in this village that there's only one.
[00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:04.080]   No, no, Dale.
[00:56:04.080 --> 00:56:06.080]   There's only one.
[00:56:06.080 --> 00:56:07.080]   I like this.
[00:56:07.080 --> 00:56:08.080]   So that's good.
[00:56:08.080 --> 00:56:10.320]   So yeah, there's a little tiny kevin on my map now.
[00:56:10.320 --> 00:56:11.320]   A little tiny kevin.
[00:56:11.320 --> 00:56:13.960]   Yeah, I just sent you it because I put you in now.
[00:56:13.960 --> 00:56:17.600]   So I don't know if it will say, "Oh, send it back to Kevin."
[00:56:17.600 --> 00:56:18.600]   Nice.
[00:56:18.600 --> 00:56:20.240]   And now you can navigate to Kevin.
[00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:23.120]   Of course, you'll have to get on a plane.
[00:56:23.120 --> 00:56:26.760]   And where is that right now anyway?
[00:56:26.760 --> 00:56:28.640]   He says, "Jeff Jovison is sharing with you."
[00:56:28.640 --> 00:56:29.640]   Oh, Jeff.
[00:56:29.640 --> 00:56:32.240]   I like how you like that.
[00:56:32.240 --> 00:56:33.240]   Huh?
[00:56:33.240 --> 00:56:36.960]   You'll come around, I'm sure.
[00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:39.240]   The problem is you get app fatigue.
[00:56:39.240 --> 00:56:40.800]   You get feature fatigue.
[00:56:40.800 --> 00:56:41.800]   That's true.
[00:56:41.800 --> 00:56:43.360]   There's just things I don't even bother to learn.
[00:56:43.360 --> 00:56:45.840]   And mind you, again, I live love you to Google.
[00:56:45.840 --> 00:56:47.320]   I am Google Boy.
[00:56:47.320 --> 00:56:50.320]   I use it all, but there's some things I just don't bother with.
[00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:51.320]   Yeah.
[00:56:51.320 --> 00:56:52.320]   Oh, this is a feature.
[00:56:52.320 --> 00:56:56.680]   I mean, the challenge of this feature is that if you're not careful, it ends up
[00:56:56.680 --> 00:56:59.840]   being the Harry Potter Marauder's map where it's like, "Oh, I'm tracking all these people
[00:56:59.840 --> 00:57:02.920]   all over the globe and watching them walk down the street."
[00:57:02.920 --> 00:57:07.640]   So what they have done with this that's different is they've said, "Oh, you can put a time limit
[00:57:07.640 --> 00:57:08.640]   on it."
[00:57:08.640 --> 00:57:12.360]   So you can say, "Okay, I want to share this with Jason for the next two hours because
[00:57:12.360 --> 00:57:14.120]   I'm heading up to the studio or something.
[00:57:14.120 --> 00:57:17.080]   And that doesn't grant me for you to be able to track me for the rest of my life, which
[00:57:17.080 --> 00:57:18.760]   is the problem they have with latitude."
[00:57:18.760 --> 00:57:23.080]   Just like, "Well, obviously everybody wants to know where everyone is all the time."
[00:57:23.080 --> 00:57:25.680]   So it is a bit smarter.
[00:57:25.680 --> 00:57:31.400]   But I haven't spent enough time with it yet because I've got to have a side channel conversation
[00:57:31.400 --> 00:57:34.000]   with people saying, "Please turn on this thing so I can track you on your phone."
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:35.680]   He's like, "I'm not being weird here."
[00:57:35.680 --> 00:57:37.240]   I hear exactly this.
[00:57:37.240 --> 00:57:38.240]   Exactly.
[00:57:38.240 --> 00:57:43.720]   That's the hard sell is having that conversation as far as why that needs to happen or why that
[00:57:43.720 --> 00:57:45.480]   should happen, why it's a good idea.
[00:57:45.480 --> 00:57:52.040]   And especially actually in this day and age of being very critical and suspicious of sharing
[00:57:52.040 --> 00:57:58.600]   anything about what you're doing on a daily basis using services, that's an even more
[00:57:58.600 --> 00:58:02.440]   tough sell to say, "Hey, why don't you just share with me all the time?"
[00:58:02.440 --> 00:58:03.440]   Or whatever.
[00:58:03.440 --> 00:58:07.520]   At least they have the expiration option on there so you can just be like, "For the next
[00:58:07.520 --> 00:58:09.840]   two hours, this might be important to you, so here it is."
[00:58:09.840 --> 00:58:14.400]   So what's the difference between that and the new Facebook person tracking thing?
[00:58:14.400 --> 00:58:15.560]   Similar except I think the new...
[00:58:15.560 --> 00:58:16.560]   So the new...
[00:58:16.560 --> 00:58:18.120]   Yeah, that's also in the rundown.
[00:58:18.120 --> 00:58:23.600]   Facebook's Messenger sharing, which Messenger more and more is becoming not only a messaging
[00:58:23.600 --> 00:58:30.440]   app but also just Facebook's realizing that it's used for people to connect with each
[00:58:30.440 --> 00:58:32.160]   other in physical space.
[00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:36.280]   And so they're tying in these options like, "Hey, you want to go get a drink, you know,
[00:58:36.280 --> 00:58:38.000]   built in with a filter," or whatever.
[00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:43.720]   This is kind of along those lines and it allows you to temporarily share your live location
[00:58:43.720 --> 00:58:50.080]   with either a single contact on Messenger or a group chat on Messenger.
[00:58:50.080 --> 00:58:52.160]   And I think they're very similar.
[00:58:52.160 --> 00:58:56.240]   I think one of the differences is that in the Facebook Messenger aspect, I don't think
[00:58:56.240 --> 00:59:00.440]   there's a permanent option and there is with the Google where you can just share all the
[00:59:00.440 --> 00:59:02.600]   time what you're doing location-wise.
[00:59:02.600 --> 00:59:08.800]   So I think that's a little different between the two.
[00:59:08.800 --> 00:59:10.800]   What else?
[00:59:10.800 --> 00:59:12.800]   I know we should probably...
[00:59:12.800 --> 00:59:20.720]   So I think a big story this week is that within the last week and a half, a bunch of advertisers
[00:59:20.720 --> 00:59:24.880]   starting with the Guardian, the BBC, the UK government, HAVAS, the big...
[00:59:24.880 --> 00:59:26.960]   Karsten, we talked about this last week?
[00:59:26.960 --> 00:59:28.480]   We didn't, right?
[00:59:28.480 --> 00:59:29.480]   Did we?
[00:59:29.480 --> 00:59:32.480]   Karsten saying that yes, we did.
[00:59:32.480 --> 00:59:33.480]   Oh, okay.
[00:59:33.480 --> 00:59:34.480]   I know that there was...
[00:59:34.480 --> 00:59:35.480]   I know that there was...
[00:59:35.480 --> 00:59:37.680]   But there was the initial and then there's been more...
[00:59:37.680 --> 00:59:38.680]   There was the initial and so then...
[00:59:38.680 --> 00:59:39.680]   So then I could...
[00:59:39.680 --> 00:59:40.680]   We did talk about it.
[00:59:40.680 --> 00:59:41.680]   Right.
[00:59:41.680 --> 00:59:42.680]   We did.
[00:59:42.680 --> 00:59:43.680]   The Google came back and said...
[00:59:43.680 --> 00:59:47.480]   That's what we did talk about that last week.
[00:59:47.480 --> 00:59:49.400]   Sorry, that they would enable people.
[00:59:49.400 --> 00:59:55.880]   So now Google is trying to go to the next step and trying to enable more opportunities
[00:59:55.880 --> 01:00:00.160]   for people to restrict their advertising.
[01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:08.360]   I had an event, a private chat-em-house rule, so partially private event at CUNY last Thursday
[01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:14.800]   with top advertising agencies, top ad networks, top recirculation engines, top advertisers,
[01:00:14.800 --> 01:00:18.040]   plus media people and so on, about 20 people to discuss this.
[01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:20.320]   And when we came around, there's a lot of effort to...
[01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:23.360]   We keep on playing whack-a-mole with the bad stuff.
[01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:28.040]   And what we probably need is more signals of quality and more safety and convincing the
[01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:32.520]   advertisers that they should be there, that it's kind of an insurance for them.
[01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:36.320]   It may cost a little more because there's a bit of scarcity here.
[01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:42.560]   But there's a lot of movement in my world around trying to get quality around advertising
[01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:45.000]   now and get away from the junk.
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:46.200]   And Google's stuck there.
[01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:47.880]   They're just stuck there.
[01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:55.520]   I mean, the big challenge as far as YouTube content is concerned, is the difference between...
[01:00:55.520 --> 01:00:57.720]   Well, I don't know.
[01:00:57.720 --> 01:01:01.560]   I guess it's just the algorithmic selection of this content.
[01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:05.960]   And I mean, there's obviously more work that Google needs to do as far as understanding
[01:01:05.960 --> 01:01:11.440]   the content in the videos in order to know whether anyone would want their ads displayed
[01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:12.440]   on this.
[01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:15.440]   And I mean, there's a lot of bad content on YouTube.
[01:01:15.440 --> 01:01:16.440]   I mean, what is it?
[01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:21.520]   400 hours of video being uploaded to YouTube every second?
[01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:22.520]   I think.
[01:01:22.520 --> 01:01:23.520]   Yes, I like that.
[01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:26.840]   So what you end up doing, and there's a danger to this, what you end up doing, I think,
[01:01:26.840 --> 01:01:29.320]   is you favor known brands.
[01:01:29.320 --> 01:01:35.560]   That brand can be twig, twit, but it's a brand.
[01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:39.560]   And it has a reputation, and it protects that reputation, and you say, "Okay, I can trust
[01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:40.560]   that."
[01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:43.960]   Then you have a wait list, which is only a little bit better than a blacklist.
[01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:51.040]   But I also think that there's other signals of either quality or danger.
[01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:54.040]   This person has only started posting in the last two hours.
[01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:58.680]   I don't think you want your ad there yet, right?
[01:01:58.680 --> 01:02:01.720]   Like patterns of virality.
[01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:04.960]   Other things that you can point to with some measure of quality.
[01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:08.520]   So it's an interesting issue that's coming across all of advertising and content now,
[01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:13.760]   and we're programmatic advertising, completely commoditized media.
[01:02:13.760 --> 01:02:16.840]   The data point about you looking at those boots that follow you around that in every
[01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:23.240]   ad you see is more important than buying an ad in an editorial environment that's appropriate
[01:02:23.240 --> 01:02:25.200]   to buying boots.
[01:02:25.200 --> 01:02:26.680]   And so we became commodity.
[01:02:26.680 --> 01:02:28.040]   Who cares where my ad is?
[01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:30.920]   As long as they want boots, I'll put the ad there.
[01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:33.320]   And so I think that's going to change a bit.
[01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:35.320]   So maybe good for brands like twig.
[01:02:35.320 --> 01:02:36.320]   Twig.
[01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:39.320]   Twig does that, right?
[01:02:39.320 --> 01:02:40.760]   Twig does sell the ads directly.
[01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:42.760]   So it is a...
[01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:43.760]   Yeah.
[01:02:43.760 --> 01:02:45.760]   But that was...
[01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:50.760]   I read a great rant about this somewhere, which I can't find now, of course, which was
[01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:56.600]   someone saying, "Well, actually what happened was the historical data was, the historical
[01:02:56.600 --> 01:02:57.600]   reality of the project.
[01:02:57.600 --> 01:03:00.800]   And it was a project that was a project that was built in a particular way.
[01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:03.920]   And so it was a project that was built in a particular way.
[01:03:03.920 --> 01:03:05.920]   And it was built in a particular way.
[01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:08.760]   And so I think that was the project that was built in a particular way.
[01:03:08.760 --> 01:03:10.240]   And it was built in a particular way.
[01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:12.760]   And so I think that was the project that was built in a particular way.
[01:03:12.760 --> 01:03:17.560]   And so I think that was the project that was built in a particular way, and it was the
[01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:19.840]   project that was built in a particular way.
[01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:23.080]   And so I think that's the project that was built in a particular way.
[01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:28.080]   And so I think that was the project that was built in a particular way.
[01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:33.080]   And so I think that was the project that was built in a particular way.
[01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:37.080]   And so I think that was the project that was built in a particular way.
[01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:42.080]   And so I think that was the project that was built in a particular way.
[01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:45.080]   And so I think that was the project that was built in a particular way.
[01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:49.080]   And so I think that was the project that was built in a particular way.
[01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:54.080]   And so I think that was the project that was built in a particular way.
[01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:59.080]   And so I think that was the project that was built in a particular way.
[01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:04.080]   And so I think that was the project that was built in a particular way.
[01:04:04.080 --> 01:04:09.080]   And so I think that was the project that was built in a particular way.
[01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:12.080]   And so I think that was the project that was built in a particular way.
[01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:16.080]   And so I think that was the project that was built in a particular way.
[01:04:16.080 --> 01:04:20.080]   And so I think that was the project that was built in a particular way.
[01:04:20.080 --> 01:04:24.080]   And so I think that was the project that was built in a particular way.
[01:04:24.080 --> 01:04:29.080]   And so I think that was the project that was built in a particular way.
[01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:33.080]   And so I think that was the project that was built in a particular way.
[01:04:33.080 --> 01:04:37.080]   And so I think that was the project that was built in a particular way.
[01:04:37.080 --> 01:04:40.080]   And so I think that was the project that was built in a particular way.
[01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:44.080]   And so I think that was the project that was built in a particular way.
[01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:48.080]   And so I think that was the project that was built in a particular way.
[01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:52.080]   And so I think that was the project that was built in a particular way.
[01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:57.080]   And so I think that was the project that was built in a particular way.
[01:04:57.080 --> 01:05:01.080]   And so I think that was the project that was built in a particular way.
[01:05:01.080 --> 01:05:04.080]   And so I think that was the project that was built in a particular way.
[01:05:04.080 --> 01:05:08.080]   And so I think that was the project that was built in a particular way.
[01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:12.080]   And so I think that was the project that was built in a particular way.
[01:05:12.080 --> 01:05:16.080]   And so I think that was the project that was built in a particular way.
[01:05:16.080 --> 01:05:20.080]   And so I think that was built in a particular way.
[01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:23.080]   And so I think that was built in a particular way.
[01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:26.080]   And so I think that was built in a particular way.
[01:05:26.080 --> 01:05:29.080]   And so I think that was the project that was built in a particular way.
[01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:32.080]   And so I think that was built in a particular way.
[01:05:32.080 --> 01:05:34.080]   And so I think that was built in a particular way.
[01:05:34.080 --> 01:05:36.080]   And so I think that was built in a particular way.
[01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:39.080]   And so I think that was built in a particular way.
[01:05:39.080 --> 01:05:43.080]   And so I think that was built in a particular way.
[01:05:43.080 --> 01:05:47.080]   And so I think that was built in a particular way.
[01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:50.080]   And so I think that was built in a particular way.
[01:05:50.080 --> 01:05:53.080]   And so I think that was built in a particular way.
[01:05:53.080 --> 01:05:56.080]   And so I think that was built in a particular way.
[01:05:56.080 --> 01:05:59.080]   And so I think that was built in a particular way.
[01:05:59.080 --> 01:06:02.080]   And so I think that was built in a particular way.
[01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:05.080]   And so I think that was built in a particular way.
[01:06:05.080 --> 01:06:11.080]   So the interesting thing for me was having made this thing,
[01:06:11.080 --> 01:06:15.080]   I find that I'm pressing it more and more in the same way that I'm in Safari,
[01:06:15.080 --> 01:06:20.080]   you press the Readability button or there's a way of saying just get this thing out of my face.
[01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:25.080]   And because the apps are closed fast, this is often quicker than finding the,
[01:06:25.080 --> 01:06:28.080]   take this thing off my face button on the screen.
[01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:39.080]   So it's another market for the crisis of advertising that we're always still trying to solve.
[01:06:39.080 --> 01:06:46.080]   Meanwhile, many of the advertisers that were hit by this on YouTube are,
[01:06:46.080 --> 01:06:50.080]   of course, still advertising on Google Search because it's working over there.
[01:06:50.080 --> 01:06:51.080]   Things are working over there.
[01:06:51.080 --> 01:06:52.080]   They've got that figured out.
[01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:55.080]   It's probably much easier to analyze text than it is video.
[01:06:55.080 --> 01:06:57.080]   Google is working on analyzing video.
[01:06:57.080 --> 01:07:01.080]   Though didn't they mention, gosh, it was like three weeks a month ago
[01:07:01.080 --> 01:07:10.080]   about advancements that they have in their AI that's able to watch full video scenes
[01:07:10.080 --> 01:07:15.080]   or longer clips or whatever and tell you exactly what's happening on every screen
[01:07:15.080 --> 01:07:21.080]   and when a scene change happens and just all sorts of crazy stuff just by analyzing video in real time.
[01:07:21.080 --> 01:07:23.080]   So they're getting there.
[01:07:23.080 --> 01:07:26.080]   Maybe that technology gets applied to YouTube and it ends up being a little bit easier for them to
[01:07:26.080 --> 01:07:28.080]   understand what they're actually seeing.
[01:07:28.080 --> 01:07:30.080]   Seems to be the way that it's going.
[01:07:30.080 --> 01:07:38.080]   Well, I mean, the challenge is working out what's really going on because it's like the Facebook
[01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:42.080]   gave me subscriptions and they'll say two people were standing in front of a sign
[01:07:42.080 --> 01:07:46.080]   and it's like, okay, yes, but the reason I care about that photograph is it's my son's
[01:07:46.080 --> 01:07:47.080]   and the sign is not relevant.
[01:07:47.080 --> 01:07:48.080]   Right.
[01:07:48.080 --> 01:07:52.080]   And Facebook actually has that information but is not using it in their AI stuff,
[01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:56.080]   possibly because it's too creepy.
[01:07:56.080 --> 01:08:01.080]   Google has enough material in YouTube to train lots of official recognition things.
[01:08:01.080 --> 01:08:05.080]   They probably can get out who's the actors in the scene already automatically.
[01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:07.080]   I'd be surprised that they haven't built that already.
[01:08:07.080 --> 01:08:11.080]   They're probably being quiet about it because they're scaring its implications.
[01:08:11.080 --> 01:08:13.080]   Sure, sure.
[01:08:13.080 --> 01:08:17.080]   Let's take a break and we'll get back to more news.
[01:08:17.080 --> 01:08:18.080]   We've got a lot in there.
[01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:22.080]   Probably not going to get through a lot of it, but we'll do our very best.
[01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:23.080]   That's what we do here.
[01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:26.080]   But let's take a break and thank the sponsor of today's episode.
[01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:27.080]   That is Segment.
[01:08:27.080 --> 01:08:32.080]   Segment is a data hub platform that makes it simple to collect,
[01:08:32.080 --> 01:08:37.080]   unify and act on your customer data across all of your websites,
[01:08:37.080 --> 01:08:40.080]   mobile apps and cloud platforms.
[01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:44.080]   There are hundreds of different tools for digging into your data, you know,
[01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:47.080]   Google Analytics, Optimizely, Mixpanel.
[01:08:47.080 --> 01:08:53.080]   All of these tools can be useful for different teams to figure out how your users are engaging
[01:08:53.080 --> 01:08:55.080]   with your business.
[01:08:55.080 --> 01:09:00.080]   Unfortunately, many of these tools require you to write custom code in order to gather the data
[01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:01.080]   and to set up your integrations.
[01:09:01.080 --> 01:09:07.080]   Also, they may only cover only portions of your data and not all of it.
[01:09:07.080 --> 01:09:13.080]   So, you know, there is a platform that enables writing integration code only once.
[01:09:13.080 --> 01:09:19.080]   You can choose a single API, a tool for unifying your data and performing analytics on any platform
[01:09:19.080 --> 01:09:22.080]   from Marchetto to Melchimp.
[01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:24.080]   And Segment is that platform.
[01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:30.080]   It's used by some of the world's best companies, like Atlassian, Intuit, New Relic and Reuters.
[01:09:30.080 --> 01:09:36.080]   You can choose from hundreds of partner integrations, including the most popular apps for advertising,
[01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:42.080]   analytics, A/B testing, attribution.
[01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:45.080]   And that's just from the A section of Segment's diverse partner catalog.
[01:09:45.080 --> 01:09:52.080]   With Segment, a developer can quickly integrate a new analytics tool for the data-driven account manager,
[01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:59.080]   another for that app happy marketer, and even another for the data scientist who needs the flexibility
[01:09:59.080 --> 01:10:02.080]   of a unified data warehouse.
[01:10:02.080 --> 01:10:04.080]   Segment lets you dig deeper as well.
[01:10:04.080 --> 01:10:06.080]   You can bring your data from any source.
[01:10:06.080 --> 01:10:08.080]   You can import historical data.
[01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:13.080]   You can customize what ends up in your data warehouse of choice.
[01:10:13.080 --> 01:10:20.080]   And Segment is the customer data platform that both developers and analysts love because of its elegant
[01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:24.080]   API and extensive partner ecosystem.
[01:10:24.080 --> 01:10:30.080]   You're going to spend time using your analytics data and actually acting on it and not wasting time
[01:10:30.080 --> 01:10:33.080]   struggling with custom integrations and all that.
[01:10:33.080 --> 01:10:41.080]   Thanks to Segment, your CEO will love your quickly deployed integrations with tools like ZenDesk, Intercom,
[01:10:41.080 --> 01:10:43.080]   and AppNexus.
[01:10:43.080 --> 01:10:48.080]   Over 8,000 of the world's best companies use Segment to drive growth and revenue.
[01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:55.080]   And now, Twit listeners can try the Segment Team Plan free for three months.
[01:10:55.080 --> 01:11:06.080]   When you sign up at Segment.com/Twit, go to Segment.com/Twit to sign up for yourself and check it out.
[01:11:06.080 --> 01:11:13.080]   And we thank Segment for their support of this week in Google and the Twit Network.
[01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:15.080]   All right, Jeff.
[01:11:15.080 --> 01:11:21.080]   So we've got a block here to talk about anything that, I don't know, what floats your boat?
[01:11:21.080 --> 01:11:22.080]   What in this deck?
[01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:23.080]   Because there's so much stuff in here.
[01:11:23.080 --> 01:11:30.080]   And I don't want to waste time with stuff that is kind of like, meh, when there's really important, interesting stuff going on right now.
[01:11:30.080 --> 01:11:32.080]   What do you think we need to talk about?
[01:11:32.080 --> 01:11:39.080]   Do you want to talk about some of the security stuff?
[01:11:39.080 --> 01:11:42.080]   I mean, you know, this round is really...
[01:11:42.080 --> 01:11:44.080]   Well, I think we should talk about Congress.
[01:11:44.080 --> 01:11:46.080]   Yeah, I think we probably should.
[01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:49.080]   And the UK coming from the US.
[01:11:49.080 --> 01:11:50.080]   Yes, right.
[01:11:50.080 --> 01:11:53.080]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:11:53.080 --> 01:11:55.080]   It's not news to anybody.
[01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:56.080]   We're not going to report news here.
[01:11:56.080 --> 01:12:04.080]   Everybody knows that Congress voted to enable your privacy to still be sold by your ISPs and phone companies.
[01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:06.080]   And who wasn't?
[01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:08.080]   So I just posted this.
[01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:17.080]   Somebody put up the Verge, put up a list of every member of the 265 members of Congress who sold you out to ISPs and how much it cost to buy them.
[01:12:17.080 --> 01:12:21.080]   All of their... I'll put this up on the rundown now.
[01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:25.080]   So it's a shame.
[01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:27.080]   That's where we are.
[01:12:27.080 --> 01:12:29.080]   That's where we are.
[01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:32.080]   There's very little protection for us as consumers anymore.
[01:12:32.080 --> 01:12:34.080]   And the thing I don't know is this.
[01:12:34.080 --> 01:12:40.080]   Somebody said on TV yesterday that you can still tell your ISP and your phone company not do this.
[01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:42.080]   You have to go to the effort to do that.
[01:12:42.080 --> 01:12:45.080]   Does anyone know what it takes to do that?
[01:12:45.080 --> 01:12:53.080]   And can somebody make that into a nice, easy feature that we can all just go and write automated letters demanding that they not share our stuff?
[01:12:53.080 --> 01:12:55.080]   Yeah, that was one of my big questions.
[01:12:55.080 --> 01:13:03.080]   I mean, should be reiterated because I feel like a lot of the reporting and stuff that's happening around this is not...
[01:13:03.080 --> 01:13:10.080]   It's not as easy to read it and understand that no rules have been in place yet.
[01:13:10.080 --> 01:13:12.080]   This is how it's been.
[01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:20.080]   This rule that the FCC put into place said that by the end of 2017, they would no longer be able to do this.
[01:13:20.080 --> 01:13:22.080]   They still can.
[01:13:22.080 --> 01:13:25.080]   And so I haven't seen any information.
[01:13:25.080 --> 01:13:40.080]   If the rule was to force ISPs to be upfront as far as what data they are collecting and how they want to use that and allow you to choose either way.
[01:13:40.080 --> 01:13:45.080]   And now without that rule, I mean, is there still any chance... do you still have any control over it?
[01:13:45.080 --> 01:13:50.080]   Like, is it the kind of thing that you could step in and say, "Actually, don't include me in that?"
[01:13:50.080 --> 01:13:56.080]   Or are you just kind of included in part of this because you are a customer and you have no choice?
[01:13:56.080 --> 01:14:01.080]   I haven't seen anything that says that you do, that you have that ability, but I would love to see it.
[01:14:01.080 --> 01:14:02.080]   I agree.
[01:14:02.080 --> 01:14:08.080]   Well, that's the challenge because the shorthand is like they're showing your browser history.
[01:14:08.080 --> 01:14:11.080]   But actually what it is is they're showing your DNS lookup.
[01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:18.080]   And so the workaround is to not use their DNS if you can, but that is always straightforward.
[01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:21.080]   And setting that up is not something you can easily explain to people.
[01:14:21.080 --> 01:14:24.080]   So it is one of these...
[01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:35.080]   It's this sort of nasty thing where the ISPs, the telcos have this Google Facebook envious where they want to do the kind of data mining stuff that Google has basically do,
[01:14:35.080 --> 01:14:38.080]   but actually they're not any good at this.
[01:14:38.080 --> 01:14:46.080]   If they were any good at data mining, they wouldn't spam you with sign up for our service when you already got their service stuff,
[01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:50.080]   or they wouldn't, you know, when you type in a URL, it doesn't exist.
[01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:53.080]   It serves your page that is full of the worst ads in the world.
[01:14:53.080 --> 01:15:02.080]   So actually they're terrible at this, but they would love to have the story that, "Oh, we can do this in kind of ad tracking nonsense that Google Facebook can do."
[01:15:02.080 --> 01:15:07.080]   And so there's this sort of skunk works inside every telco that's trying to do this kind of thing.
[01:15:07.080 --> 01:15:16.080]   And lots of them are in trouble for this kind of thing in the past because it does violate the net neutrality and separation of power rules that exist in different countries.
[01:15:16.080 --> 01:15:25.080]   And the Trump administration's sort of reflex thing is saying, "Well, we should just...
[01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:30.080]   "Corporations do things as corporations know what they're doing and governments don't."
[01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:38.080]   And that's the sort of more sensible rules that were in place.
[01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:49.080]   But the risk is that while we're heading to encryption, we're going to be able to be man in the middle in annoying ways,
[01:15:49.080 --> 01:15:55.080]   but that's the company you're buying the connection from.
[01:15:55.080 --> 01:15:58.080]   Now, Jeff, did you put this in the chat?
[01:15:58.080 --> 01:16:02.080]   Popular mechanics, which is really... It does great stuff, by the way.
[01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:07.080]   It does have procedures and links for where you can opt out.
[01:16:07.080 --> 01:16:12.080]   So for instance, if you go to Verizon, there is a place where you can go do this.
[01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:20.080]   So I think that what I would like to see, probably is you've got to sign into your account and they make it as hard as possible.
[01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:21.080]   Of course.
[01:16:21.080 --> 01:16:22.080]   To sign in.
[01:16:22.080 --> 01:16:29.080]   But I wish that there were a legal... There's no legal requirement or anything, but I wish there were a way that you could send them a letter and then say,
[01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:32.080]   "I put you on notice. I don't opt in. Don't do it."
[01:16:32.080 --> 01:16:34.080]   And start taking them to court.
[01:16:34.080 --> 01:16:47.080]   I think the ACLU is suing them already. No, there's a new, huge First Amendment initiative at Columbia University, backed by like $25 million from the Knight Foundation.
[01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:51.080]   And they are filing suit around this now.
[01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:52.080]   I'm sure there'll be more too.
[01:16:52.080 --> 01:17:03.080]   If it makes you feel any better, there's a guy named Adam McKeowny, who created a GoFundMe page to purchase the browser history of those who voted for the bill.
[01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:12.080]   For the recusal of the bill, as well as those who supported the recusal within the FCC and I plan to...
[01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:14.080]   Can you really buy it with PII?
[01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:15.080]   I don't know.
[01:17:15.080 --> 01:17:16.080]   It's a really great question.
[01:17:16.080 --> 01:17:17.080]   I know you can.
[01:17:17.080 --> 01:17:17.080]   Yeah.
[01:17:17.080 --> 01:17:21.080]   I mean, it's fun, but I don't want to see make money when something you can't do.
[01:17:21.080 --> 01:17:22.080]   There's $93,000.
[01:17:22.080 --> 01:17:23.080]   Wow.
[01:17:23.080 --> 01:17:24.080]   I don't think you can really do that.
[01:17:24.080 --> 01:17:25.080]   Wow.
[01:17:25.080 --> 01:17:29.080]   This shot up super quick because before the show when I was prepping, I think it was somewhere...
[01:17:29.080 --> 01:17:33.080]   The goal, I think, is $10,000. I think it was at $7,000 before the show.
[01:17:33.080 --> 01:17:37.080]   Now it's at $93,788.
[01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:38.080]   Yeah.
[01:17:38.080 --> 01:17:39.080]   I mean, that's a big question.
[01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:42.080]   And I was kind of reading through some of the comments on this GoFundMe page.
[01:17:42.080 --> 01:17:48.080]   And there was a lot of support, but there's a lot of people like, "Okay, what happens with this money?"
[01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:58.080]   And kind of urging him to get in touch with the EFF so things can be done a little bit more coordinated instead of random guy.
[01:17:58.080 --> 01:18:02.080]   So it's kind of random guy sets up GoFundMe page because it's a hot button topic.
[01:18:02.080 --> 01:18:03.080]   Yeah.
[01:18:03.080 --> 01:18:06.080]   You know, certainly wouldn't want that.
[01:18:06.080 --> 01:18:09.080]   But anyways, that exists.
[01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:16.080]   And yeah, and I'm really happy that you found that, Jeff, the popular mechanics thing.
[01:18:16.080 --> 01:18:19.080]   So, you know, I suppose the sky isn't totally falling.
[01:18:19.080 --> 01:18:27.080]   That you can actually log into your ISP and have some sort of controls, but it still doesn't feel very good.
[01:18:27.080 --> 01:18:28.080]   No one's going to do it.
[01:18:28.080 --> 01:18:29.080]   Well, that's the problem.
[01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:31.080]   In the rear, they're going to make it difficult.
[01:18:31.080 --> 01:18:34.080]   It's fine print.
[01:18:34.080 --> 01:18:39.080]   And, you know, in the old days, we got protected by government doing things like do not call this.
[01:18:39.080 --> 01:18:45.080]   There should be, you know, then there's talk about do not track, obviously, as an option in browsers.
[01:18:45.080 --> 01:18:48.080]   But now your ISP just knows too much.
[01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:49.080]   It knows it all.
[01:18:49.080 --> 01:18:52.080]   And I mean, you use incognito mode.
[01:18:52.080 --> 01:18:53.080]   It doesn't matter.
[01:18:53.080 --> 01:18:55.080]   The ISP knows where you're going.
[01:18:55.080 --> 01:19:01.080]   Incognito mode just makes it so that your browser on your computer shows little to no tracks.
[01:19:01.080 --> 01:19:03.080]   But I mean, it's still passing through your ISP.
[01:19:03.080 --> 01:19:05.080]   And that's the point.
[01:19:05.080 --> 01:19:11.080]   Encryption is another way that you can at least, you know, approach this run encrypted.
[01:19:11.080 --> 01:19:14.080]   That doesn't affect your browser history, right?
[01:19:14.080 --> 01:19:16.080]   That doesn't affect going to a site.
[01:19:16.080 --> 01:19:18.080]   The ISP knows where you're going.
[01:19:18.080 --> 01:19:20.080]   Well, well, it depends.
[01:19:20.080 --> 01:19:23.080]   It depends to be energy using.
[01:19:23.080 --> 01:19:24.080]   Yeah.
[01:19:24.080 --> 01:19:28.080]   So you can use Google Glass and then Google won't know what you're doing.
[01:19:28.080 --> 01:19:30.080]   So that's still that trade-offs.
[01:19:30.080 --> 01:19:38.080]   And you can use the VPN, but then they can go to the PX port and see what's going on there.
[01:19:38.080 --> 01:19:41.080]   So go to the beginning, or the endpoint, the endpoint of VPN.
[01:19:41.080 --> 01:19:42.080]   Yeah.
[01:19:42.080 --> 01:19:43.080]   It depends.
[01:19:43.080 --> 01:19:44.080]   Yeah, it depends on your adversaries here.
[01:19:44.080 --> 01:19:50.080]   But yeah, the I had coming in adversary is kind of bad because they do have control of the...
[01:19:50.080 --> 01:19:51.080]   Yeah.
[01:19:51.080 --> 01:19:52.080]   Yeah.
[01:19:52.080 --> 01:19:54.080]   And I'm sorry, Kevin, you're breaking up.
[01:19:54.080 --> 01:19:55.080]   So we've heard part of that.
[01:19:55.080 --> 01:19:57.080]   But I think we heard what we needed to on that point.
[01:19:57.080 --> 01:19:58.080]   We're breaking up.
[01:19:58.080 --> 01:19:59.080]   Yeah.
[01:19:59.080 --> 01:20:00.080]   Now it's actually a little bit worse.
[01:20:00.080 --> 01:20:01.080]   It's a little bit...
[01:20:01.080 --> 01:20:02.080]   Oh, it's yeah.
[01:20:02.080 --> 01:20:04.080]   It's Skype and it just got worse.
[01:20:04.080 --> 01:20:05.080]   So...
[01:20:05.080 --> 01:20:08.080]   It's just like, I thought it was going to be better.
[01:20:08.080 --> 01:20:09.080]   Yeah.
[01:20:09.080 --> 01:20:11.080]   Work on that on the back end.
[01:20:11.080 --> 01:20:12.080]   But yeah.
[01:20:12.080 --> 01:20:14.080]   You know the weird story that I...
[01:20:14.080 --> 01:20:16.080]   Oh, I forgot to put it up.
[01:20:16.080 --> 01:20:17.080]   Oh, sorry.
[01:20:17.080 --> 01:20:22.080]   Did you see the blackest paint story?
[01:20:22.080 --> 01:20:25.080]   No, I did not.
[01:20:25.080 --> 01:20:26.080]   This is a fun one.
[01:20:26.080 --> 01:20:27.080]   So it's all...
[01:20:27.080 --> 01:20:28.080]   It'll be in there on the...
[01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:29.080]   No, just one second.
[01:20:29.080 --> 01:20:30.080]   There it is.
[01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:31.080]   Bottom of the rundown.
[01:20:31.080 --> 01:20:32.080]   Blackest paint.
[01:20:32.080 --> 01:20:33.080]   Blackest black paint ever.
[01:20:33.080 --> 01:20:37.080]   I saw it happening and I thought, oh, this is going to be a...
[01:20:37.080 --> 01:20:39.080]   This is somebody just fooling with us.
[01:20:39.080 --> 01:20:40.080]   This is a...
[01:20:40.080 --> 01:20:43.080]   I mean, within 12 hours, I'm going to see this is a hoax.
[01:20:43.080 --> 01:20:45.080]   But apparently not.
[01:20:45.080 --> 01:20:48.080]   It's a paint that's been around for a while.
[01:20:48.080 --> 01:20:51.080]   And now it's a spray paint.
[01:20:51.080 --> 01:20:52.080]   Vanta black.
[01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:54.080]   It traps...
[01:20:54.080 --> 01:21:00.080]   The spray paint traps 99.8% of ultraviolet visible in infrared light.
[01:21:00.080 --> 01:21:04.080]   And so there's pictures, which won't work on the audio.
[01:21:04.080 --> 01:21:05.080]   Sorry, folks.
[01:21:05.080 --> 01:21:07.080]   But it looks like somebody just did a photo shop with a photo.
[01:21:07.080 --> 01:21:08.080]   Totally does.
[01:21:08.080 --> 01:21:09.080]   Made the time circle.
[01:21:09.080 --> 01:21:11.080]   I would guess that this is...
[01:21:11.080 --> 01:21:13.080]   Wow, that's crazy.
[01:21:13.080 --> 01:21:14.080]   Isn't that great?
[01:21:14.080 --> 01:21:16.080]   Then below, there's a picture of a statue.
[01:21:16.080 --> 01:21:17.080]   It's pretty impressive.
[01:21:17.080 --> 01:21:18.080]   It's not a statue.
[01:21:18.080 --> 01:21:20.080]   One of which is painted.
[01:21:20.080 --> 01:21:21.080]   And so it's useful.
[01:21:21.080 --> 01:21:23.080]   There's industrial uses for this.
[01:21:23.080 --> 01:21:32.080]   If you're making a telescope lens, you want to eliminate the reflection of light.
[01:21:32.080 --> 01:21:34.080]   You know, you need to do things like this.
[01:21:34.080 --> 01:21:36.080]   But I just... I don't know why, but I found that...
[01:21:36.080 --> 01:21:38.080]   You know, it's like invisible man stuff.
[01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:41.080]   You absorb light.
[01:21:41.080 --> 01:21:43.080]   You're your own black hole.
[01:21:43.080 --> 01:21:47.080]   And after all, I wear black every day, so I just want to make clothes out of the stuff.
[01:21:47.080 --> 01:21:48.080]   You can't see me.
[01:21:48.080 --> 01:21:49.080]   Yep.
[01:21:49.080 --> 01:21:51.080]   No one's going to see me anymore.
[01:21:51.080 --> 01:21:54.080]   There's something about this that's so black.
[01:21:54.080 --> 01:21:56.080]   It's like, how much more black could this be?
[01:21:56.080 --> 01:21:57.080]   And the answer is none.
[01:21:57.080 --> 01:21:59.080]   None more black.
[01:21:59.080 --> 01:22:00.080]   No.
[01:22:00.080 --> 01:22:05.080]   Spinal tap reference there for those of you who have never seen that movie go see it.
[01:22:05.080 --> 01:22:08.080]   But I mean, this is honestly...
[01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:11.080]   There is no story that is better for that quote than this story.
[01:22:11.080 --> 01:22:13.080]   That's so weird.
[01:22:13.080 --> 01:22:14.080]   That is so crazy.
[01:22:14.080 --> 01:22:15.080]   Is that weird?
[01:22:15.080 --> 01:22:17.080]   It's just a little science moment here.
[01:22:17.080 --> 01:22:18.080]   I like this one.
[01:22:18.080 --> 01:22:19.080]   I love that.
[01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:22.080]   Now I want that for my house.
[01:22:22.080 --> 01:22:25.080]   I want a blackout wall just because I could.
[01:22:25.080 --> 01:22:26.080]   Oh boy.
[01:22:26.080 --> 01:22:28.080]   What's see here?
[01:22:28.080 --> 01:22:29.080]   What else?
[01:22:29.080 --> 01:22:34.080]   We can wrap up with like one more thing before we go to a break and then do our picks and tips and all that kind of stuff.
[01:22:34.080 --> 01:22:36.080]   Well, I think Andy Ruben's new phone.
[01:22:36.080 --> 01:22:37.080]   Oh, yes, right?
[01:22:37.080 --> 01:22:41.080]   A little bit... you, Dr. Androids, you tell us about that.
[01:22:41.080 --> 01:22:46.080]   Well, I mean, so Andy Ruben, you know, he's working a lot of things post Google.
[01:22:46.080 --> 01:22:47.080]   He's been in AI.
[01:22:47.080 --> 01:22:49.080]   He's been in robotics, all this kind of stuff.
[01:22:49.080 --> 01:22:57.080]   Well, now we're starting to hear about his next kind of stealthy startup thing called essential, I believe is what it's called.
[01:22:57.080 --> 01:23:06.080]   And he tweeted out a couple of days ago, a close up shot of a phone in a hand.
[01:23:06.080 --> 01:23:08.080]   Don't know if it's Andy's hand.
[01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:10.080]   Don't know if those designer jeans are Andy's jeans.
[01:23:10.080 --> 01:23:16.080]   But we do have a hunch that that phone in his hand is probably part of his next project.
[01:23:16.080 --> 01:23:21.080]   He says, "I'm really excited about how this is shaping up, eager to get in in more people's hands."
[01:23:21.080 --> 01:23:25.080]   And I mean, from what you can see, you know, talk about the year of no bezel.
[01:23:25.080 --> 01:23:27.080]   This thing has like...
[01:23:27.080 --> 01:23:30.080]   I mean, that pretty much no bezel.
[01:23:30.080 --> 01:23:34.080]   It's not entirely eliminated, nor should it be really.
[01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:41.080]   But it's pretty minimal what we're seeing here and very curious to see what he's working.
[01:23:41.080 --> 01:23:43.080]   I mean, he's the father of Android.
[01:23:43.080 --> 01:23:47.080]   So I will always be curious to see what he's working on because...
[01:23:47.080 --> 01:23:51.080]   Well, I spend so much time obsessing over Android, so that's why.
[01:23:51.080 --> 01:23:52.080]   But I don't know.
[01:23:52.080 --> 01:23:54.080]   It looks interesting.
[01:23:54.080 --> 01:23:59.080]   The rumors say that we might actually hear something by this summer about an actual product.
[01:23:59.080 --> 01:24:01.080]   It's supposedly going to be...
[01:24:01.080 --> 01:24:13.080]   As they all want to be a competitor to the iPhone, kind of a premium smartphone, might have some 3D touch features.
[01:24:13.080 --> 01:24:26.080]   I think I read somewhere that also that it would have some sort of a way to plug in hardware components into it with like a proprietary connecting system of some sort.
[01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:32.080]   So you could plug in like a spherical 360 camera or, you know, I don't know.
[01:24:32.080 --> 01:24:35.080]   Maybe the modularity boat has...
[01:24:35.080 --> 01:24:40.080]   A ship has sailed at this point and this is a little late to the game if that's what this is touting.
[01:24:40.080 --> 01:24:42.080]   But we don't really know much beyond that.
[01:24:42.080 --> 01:24:46.080]   It's all kind of rumor in this little tiny corner Twitter shot.
[01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:49.080]   But...
[01:24:49.080 --> 01:24:52.080]   And Eric Ferguson did say that it's going to be Android.
[01:24:52.080 --> 01:24:53.080]   Yes.
[01:24:53.080 --> 01:24:55.080]   Andy Rubensfeld will run Android, which is good news.
[01:24:55.080 --> 01:24:56.080]   Yeah.
[01:24:56.080 --> 01:24:59.080]   Oh, see, and I missed the Eric quote.
[01:24:59.080 --> 01:25:03.080]   I just assumed because it was Andy it was going to be running Android, but that's good to know.
[01:25:03.080 --> 01:25:05.080]   I assume too, but you know, who do?
[01:25:05.080 --> 01:25:06.080]   Yeah.
[01:25:06.080 --> 01:25:07.080]   No.
[01:25:07.080 --> 01:25:08.080]   Hey.
[01:25:08.080 --> 01:25:09.080]   That's a good piece of additional information.
[01:25:09.080 --> 01:25:12.080]   So I'm excited to see anything that he's working on.
[01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:15.080]   If he created Android...
[01:25:15.080 --> 01:25:17.080]   Hey, he's good in my book.
[01:25:17.080 --> 01:25:20.080]   He's a smart guy.
[01:25:20.080 --> 01:25:24.080]   Oh, anything else?
[01:25:24.080 --> 01:25:29.080]   I'm just looking over here real quick to see if we missed anything obvious.
[01:25:29.080 --> 01:25:30.080]   And...
[01:25:30.080 --> 01:25:31.080]   Oh...
[01:25:31.080 --> 01:25:34.080]   I think we might be good.
[01:25:34.080 --> 01:25:36.080]   I think we might be pretty good.
[01:25:36.080 --> 01:25:37.080]   Yeah.
[01:25:37.080 --> 01:25:38.080]   All right.
[01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:39.080]   How about you guys?
[01:25:39.080 --> 01:25:40.080]   Mr. Host.
[01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:45.080]   Prepare yourselves for the tips, the numbers, the picks, the stuff.
[01:25:45.080 --> 01:25:49.080]   Whatever they happen to be, depending on who we're talking to.
[01:25:49.080 --> 01:25:51.840]   Before we get to that, let's thank the sponsor of today's episode.
[01:25:51.840 --> 01:25:55.800]   This is yet another time during today's show where you will get very hungry because this
[01:25:55.800 --> 01:26:01.240]   episode is brought to you by Blue Apron, the number one fresh ingredient and recipe delivery
[01:26:01.240 --> 01:26:02.680]   service in the country.
[01:26:02.680 --> 01:26:03.680]   I love Blue Apron.
[01:26:03.680 --> 01:26:10.480]   We got our box yesterday and I think we have like a catfish sandwich as part of the box.
[01:26:10.480 --> 01:26:14.160]   And I can't remember the other item, but we're going to be making one tonight.
[01:26:14.160 --> 01:26:15.160]   That's for sure.
[01:26:15.160 --> 01:26:20.160]   Blue Apron's mission is to make incredible home cooking accessible to everyone.
[01:26:20.160 --> 01:26:24.240]   Blue Apron delivers seasonal recipes along with fresh high quality ingredients to make
[01:26:24.240 --> 01:26:26.640]   delicious home cooked meals.
[01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:28.480]   And every meal comes with...
[01:26:28.480 --> 01:26:32.360]   It's like a whole kit that you get in the Blue Apron box when it arrives on your step.
[01:26:32.360 --> 01:26:35.160]   You get a step-by-step, easy to follow recipe card.
[01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:39.880]   You get pre-portioned ingredients to match that recipe card that can all be prepared
[01:26:39.880 --> 01:26:41.840]   in 40 minutes or less.
[01:26:41.840 --> 01:26:43.200]   And I've made a lot of these meals.
[01:26:43.200 --> 01:26:48.200]   They are solidly under 40 minutes, which is great when you don't want to spend all night
[01:26:48.200 --> 01:26:50.440]   cooking in the kitchen.
[01:26:50.440 --> 01:26:54.440]   If you happen to spend a lot of money, a lot of time at restaurants or high-end grocery
[01:26:54.440 --> 01:27:00.280]   chains, well, you're going to get something that spends where you're spending under $10
[01:27:00.280 --> 01:27:04.400]   per person for a delicious meal with Blue Apron.
[01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:07.520]   Not all ingredients are created equal, of course, so it's important to know where your
[01:27:07.520 --> 01:27:09.120]   food comes from.
[01:27:09.120 --> 01:27:13.560]   And Blue Apron sets the highest quality standards for their community of over 150 local farms,
[01:27:13.560 --> 01:27:15.920]   fisheries, and ranchers across the US.
[01:27:15.920 --> 01:27:20.400]   And by shipping the exact amount of every ingredient that's required for a recipe, Blue
[01:27:20.400 --> 01:27:22.600]   Apron is reducing food waste.
[01:27:22.600 --> 01:27:23.600]   You use it all.
[01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:27.480]   It all goes into the pot, so to speak.
[01:27:27.480 --> 01:27:31.720]   Their fresh and scaring tea promises that every ingredient in your delivery arrives ready
[01:27:31.720 --> 01:27:33.960]   to cook or they'll make it right.
[01:27:33.960 --> 01:27:36.960]   Blue Apron delivers to 99% of the continental US.
[01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:41.440]   There's no weekly commitment, so you only get deliveries when you want them.
[01:27:41.440 --> 01:27:46.720]   And you can customize your recipes every week based on your dietary preferences.
[01:27:46.720 --> 01:27:52.320]   Choose from a variety of new recipes every week, or you can just kind of let Blue Apron's
[01:27:52.320 --> 01:27:56.800]   culinary team surprise you and see what they come up with.
[01:27:56.800 --> 01:28:00.160]   That's always a nice way to go because you end up with recipes that you may not have
[01:28:00.160 --> 01:28:05.280]   picked, but that are equally delicious and you end up falling in love with them.
[01:28:05.280 --> 01:28:08.920]   These are not repeated within a year, so you'll never get bored.
[01:28:08.920 --> 01:28:13.280]   So for example, few meals, spinach and fresh mozzarella pizza with olive spell peppers
[01:28:13.280 --> 01:28:14.840]   and ricotta salata.
[01:28:14.840 --> 01:28:16.080]   I'd eat that.
[01:28:16.080 --> 01:28:19.080]   Sweet and sour salmon with bok choy, carrot and ginger fried rice.
[01:28:19.080 --> 01:28:20.080]   I'd eat that.
[01:28:20.080 --> 01:28:23.280]   Parmesan crusted chicken with creamy feta chini and roasted broccoli.
[01:28:23.280 --> 01:28:24.760]   I'd devour that.
[01:28:24.760 --> 01:28:29.960]   And baby broccoli and Fontina paninis with hard boiled egg and a rougola salad.
[01:28:29.960 --> 01:28:30.960]   I would eat that too.
[01:28:30.960 --> 01:28:32.560]   This would be an amazing box.
[01:28:32.560 --> 01:28:38.720]   So check out this week's menu and get three meals free with your first purchase and free
[01:28:38.720 --> 01:28:43.160]   shipping by going to Blue Apron.com/Twig.
[01:28:43.160 --> 01:28:45.040]   That's Blue Apron.com/Twig.
[01:28:45.040 --> 01:28:49.040]   You're going to love how it feels and tastes to create incredible home-cooked meals with
[01:28:49.040 --> 01:28:50.040]   Blue Apron.
[01:28:50.040 --> 01:28:53.200]   You're also going to love the pressure that it takes off of you when you arrive home after
[01:28:53.200 --> 01:28:57.280]   a busy day at work and you realize dinner is already planned.
[01:28:57.280 --> 01:28:58.280]   Don't wait.
[01:28:58.280 --> 01:28:59.280]   Go to Blue Apron.com/Twig.
[01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:02.040]   Blue Apron is a better way to cook.
[01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:03.040]   All right.
[01:29:03.040 --> 01:29:08.680]   Now that we're all hungry, let's get into the tasty morsels that are our picks of the
[01:29:08.680 --> 01:29:09.680]   week.
[01:29:09.680 --> 01:29:11.840]   I don't know why I said that.
[01:29:11.840 --> 01:29:13.600]   Kevin, what do you got?
[01:29:13.600 --> 01:29:17.720]   What's some of your stuff that you've got today?
[01:29:17.720 --> 01:29:24.440]   So I wanted to mention 100 Days of Indie Web, which is the project that Aaron Parecki
[01:29:24.440 --> 01:29:27.400]   started and he's getting close today 100 now.
[01:29:27.400 --> 01:29:29.400]   So he's got 100 posts.
[01:29:29.400 --> 01:29:33.520]   Each day he's done something new and interesting for Indie Web.
[01:29:33.520 --> 01:29:38.960]   And I've been doing this for eight days, so I'm all the way behind Aaron.
[01:29:38.960 --> 01:29:43.080]   So each day he sits down and thinks about something he can prevent that improves the
[01:29:43.080 --> 01:29:44.440]   Indie Web in some way.
[01:29:44.440 --> 01:29:47.640]   There's a bunch of really interesting tools and stuff in here.
[01:29:47.640 --> 01:29:50.200]   So I wanted to call it a couple of things from this.
[01:29:50.200 --> 01:29:55.560]   The most, one of the most recent ones he's set up is a thing called Onielswarm, which
[01:29:55.560 --> 01:30:05.480]   is a way to take your four square check-ins and send them to your own site.
[01:30:05.480 --> 01:30:08.640]   And you basically sign into your own site with my prop up.
[01:30:08.640 --> 01:30:13.720]   You sign into four square and then when you check in on four square, it posts it to your
[01:30:13.720 --> 01:30:16.000]   site.
[01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:24.560]   So I think this connects to the location thing we were talking about earlier, where
[01:30:24.560 --> 01:30:30.160]   the value of this is four square actually does quite a good job of making it easy for you
[01:30:30.160 --> 01:30:33.400]   to check any places and comment on them and mark them up.
[01:30:33.400 --> 01:30:37.560]   And having that on your own site is an Indie Web value and the use of things to have as
[01:30:37.560 --> 01:30:38.560]   well.
[01:30:38.560 --> 01:30:40.840]   So that's one example.
[01:30:40.840 --> 01:30:46.400]   Another example is the one I mentioned earlier, which is the give me the out version of this
[01:30:46.400 --> 01:30:51.280]   bookmark that I made as part of my 100 days of Indie Web, which basically adds to your browser
[01:30:51.280 --> 01:30:52.280]   thing.
[01:30:52.280 --> 01:30:58.360]   So on a new site that's feeling slow, you click the amp, this link, and suddenly the
[01:30:58.360 --> 01:31:03.000]   site becomes the clean, readable mobile version.
[01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.160]   Nice stuff.
[01:31:05.160 --> 01:31:10.800]   Yeah, I was wondering if you were going to keep the bookmarklet for yourself, to be honest,
[01:31:10.800 --> 01:31:14.000]   so it's nice to see that you can share it with everybody else.
[01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:15.560]   It's a useful thing to have.
[01:31:15.560 --> 01:31:16.560]   Absolutely.
[01:31:16.560 --> 01:31:20.080]   There's the corresponding one that someone else made that switches from the AMP version
[01:31:20.080 --> 01:31:24.160]   to the canonical version if you want to get back to the original link as well.
[01:31:24.160 --> 01:31:25.160]   Nice.
[01:31:25.160 --> 01:31:26.760]   Nice, good stuff.
[01:31:26.760 --> 01:31:31.280]   And Banned Four Square is just not a service that I hear of.
[01:31:31.280 --> 01:31:35.800]   It's not a service that I've ever really used with any frequency, but we have not one but
[01:31:35.800 --> 01:31:38.040]   two four square mentions here at the end of the show.
[01:31:38.040 --> 01:31:39.040]   We do.
[01:31:39.040 --> 01:31:40.040]   We do.
[01:31:40.040 --> 01:31:41.040]   Funny.
[01:31:41.040 --> 01:31:42.040]   Funny.
[01:31:42.040 --> 01:31:43.040]   This is Kismit, Kevin.
[01:31:43.040 --> 01:31:45.840]   So there was a piece in the art room magazine that came across by Nuzzl Feed, which I found
[01:31:45.840 --> 01:31:46.840]   fascinating.
[01:31:46.840 --> 01:31:48.600]   You're right, because we think four square.
[01:31:48.600 --> 01:31:49.680]   Ah, you know, four square.
[01:31:49.680 --> 01:31:53.160]   I saw somebody say on Twitter, Facebook, other day, "Four Square is dead.
[01:31:53.160 --> 01:31:54.160]   What's next?"
[01:31:54.160 --> 01:31:55.160]   Four Square is nowhere.
[01:31:55.160 --> 01:31:56.640]   Well, no, not at all.
[01:31:56.640 --> 01:31:58.680]   And I'm delighted because Dennis Crowley is nice.
[01:31:58.680 --> 01:32:00.520]   He's a great entrepreneur, alive.
[01:32:00.520 --> 01:32:02.640]   He's a great, great guy.
[01:32:02.640 --> 01:32:07.520]   And so it's a wonderful entrepreneurial story of the pivot where Dennis didn't know the
[01:32:07.520 --> 01:32:16.920]   value he had, that all of this check-in data creates tremendous forecasting data for retail,
[01:32:16.920 --> 01:32:19.160]   for hedge funds for anybody.
[01:32:19.160 --> 01:32:23.640]   So the lead starts off that the CEO who Dennis replaced himself and went on to do strategic
[01:32:23.640 --> 01:32:29.640]   things in the company and he brought in and did it as CEO, was on CNBC and predicted that
[01:32:29.640 --> 01:32:33.200]   Chipotle comparable sales would fall 29% in the first quarter.
[01:32:33.200 --> 01:32:34.200]   This was in the spring of 2016.
[01:32:34.200 --> 01:32:36.240]   He said, "You know, how can you know that?
[01:32:36.240 --> 01:32:37.240]   How can you do that?"
[01:32:37.240 --> 01:32:42.200]   And in fact, it did indeed fall 29.7% in the year earlier.
[01:32:42.200 --> 01:32:50.120]   That's because of foot traffic going into and out of and check-ins of Chipotle.
[01:32:50.120 --> 01:32:57.880]   And so it's a great story of Dennis having brought in Stephen Rosenblatt, just to help
[01:32:57.880 --> 01:32:58.880]   the company.
[01:32:58.880 --> 01:33:01.520]   And Rosenblatt came from, I think it was Apple, where everything was hidden.
[01:33:01.520 --> 01:33:03.760]   And he said, "They opened up the whole company to me.
[01:33:03.760 --> 01:33:05.080]   I saw everything you could see.
[01:33:05.080 --> 01:33:06.080]   It was amazing."
[01:33:06.080 --> 01:33:09.480]   And then when I realized the value they had, they're sitting on it and he says, "You got
[01:33:09.480 --> 01:33:11.920]   to sell this data."
[01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:15.520]   And some of the people who were using the API said, "Yeah, we've been waiting for this
[01:33:15.520 --> 01:33:16.520]   day.
[01:33:16.520 --> 01:33:18.240]   We couldn't believe you were giving away for free.
[01:33:18.240 --> 01:33:20.720]   Okay, we'll pay."
[01:33:20.720 --> 01:33:21.720]   And they made money that way.
[01:33:21.720 --> 01:33:26.320]   They had to change the culture of the company around not just making the consumer product,
[01:33:26.320 --> 01:33:28.160]   but starting to make the data.
[01:33:28.160 --> 01:33:32.480]   And so now it's headed toward, here's the number finally, $100 million revenue and finally
[01:33:32.480 --> 01:33:34.000]   profitability.
[01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:38.720]   And it's great to see a good guy like Dennis and his brother Jay Nguyen.
[01:33:38.720 --> 01:33:41.880]   And it's great to see a company that is a great lesson for my entrepreneurial students
[01:33:41.880 --> 01:33:44.480]   about how you don't always know the value you have.
[01:33:44.480 --> 01:33:53.880]   When I wrote "W
[01:33:53.880 --> 01:34:18.280]   off of the case," you don't know what your true value is, what your true company is.
[01:34:18.280 --> 01:34:21.280]   So that was my four square number of the week.
[01:34:21.280 --> 01:34:22.280]   Nice.
[01:34:22.280 --> 01:34:23.280]   I think it was around there.
[01:34:23.280 --> 01:34:24.280]   It's cool.
[01:34:24.280 --> 01:34:25.280]   But some of it was around then.
[01:34:25.280 --> 01:34:27.200]   Long time ago.
[01:34:27.200 --> 01:34:28.680]   But you were checking the places by SMS.
[01:34:28.680 --> 01:34:30.640]   You would say, "I'm at this place."
[01:34:30.640 --> 01:34:33.920]   And then it would SMS your friends and say, "Kevin's at this place."
[01:34:33.920 --> 01:34:36.520]   And they built out this model of that.
[01:34:36.520 --> 01:34:40.560]   And then they got bought by Google and went there and tried to get Google to understand
[01:34:40.560 --> 01:34:41.560]   this concept.
[01:34:41.560 --> 01:34:46.040]   But the challenge they had was that it only really works in dense cities.
[01:34:46.040 --> 01:34:49.960]   It's quite hard to do this stuff here in a rural area because there's nobody else around
[01:34:49.960 --> 01:34:51.200]   and you can't preserve it.
[01:34:51.200 --> 01:34:55.480]   But they bootstrapped it in San Francisco, New York, and it was working well there.
[01:34:55.480 --> 01:34:57.200]   And we need to make this work everywhere.
[01:34:57.200 --> 01:35:01.840]   And they're like, "You need a density of users you don't have yet."
[01:35:01.840 --> 01:35:06.440]   And there was a lot of banging their heads against the wall.
[01:35:06.440 --> 01:35:11.760]   And eventually, Dennis left and started four square, which was reinventing this for the
[01:35:11.760 --> 01:35:12.760]   mobile world.
[01:35:12.760 --> 01:35:18.360]   And they built an iPhone app, but they still had a very lean web version that worked on
[01:35:18.360 --> 01:35:20.200]   every other phone on the world.
[01:35:20.200 --> 01:35:23.080]   There was an M.4 Square.com that was around for a long time.
[01:35:23.080 --> 01:35:26.480]   Made it very easy to check into places.
[01:35:26.480 --> 01:35:31.520]   And then Dennis has sort of held onto this vision of it's a really powerful thing to
[01:35:31.520 --> 01:35:35.400]   keep track of this information for yourself and work out what that is.
[01:35:35.400 --> 01:35:38.120]   So they've always had our social history.
[01:35:38.120 --> 01:35:40.800]   They've had a good API story for people.
[01:35:40.800 --> 01:35:44.520]   They still have the best API for this place.
[01:35:44.520 --> 01:35:46.240]   "Here's my phone.
[01:35:46.240 --> 01:35:48.960]   Tell me where I am in a human-readable form."
[01:35:48.960 --> 01:35:52.000]   Their API for that is better than Google's or Facebook still.
[01:35:52.000 --> 01:35:56.160]   And it is pre-to-developers up to a certain usage tracking thing.
[01:35:56.160 --> 01:35:59.320]   So there's a lot of smart knowledge in the company.
[01:35:59.320 --> 01:36:04.720]   As you say, the challenge with all these things is how do we work out who is going to pay
[01:36:04.720 --> 01:36:07.520]   us money to support this?
[01:36:07.520 --> 01:36:11.120]   Once we have this, once we've concentrated on building this, how does it support this?
[01:36:11.120 --> 01:36:18.280]   And the foot traffic stuff, that's encouraged, it's kind of weird, but because it's aggregated
[01:36:18.280 --> 01:36:21.920]   data, it's a reasonable thing to sell.
[01:36:21.920 --> 01:36:26.680]   Saying, "Oh, the phone knows which shop to go into is a bit freaky, but they provide
[01:36:26.680 --> 01:36:28.080]   utility for you with that."
[01:36:28.080 --> 01:36:33.240]   And they applied the game thing with Swarm that I was saying we can pull back onto your
[01:36:33.240 --> 01:36:34.520]   own side.
[01:36:34.520 --> 01:36:41.400]   But the aggregate data is a useful and fascinating thing that doesn't make sense to you as an
[01:36:41.400 --> 01:36:42.400]   individual.
[01:36:42.400 --> 01:36:45.240]   It makes a lot of sense to the companies who want to know about that aggregate data.
[01:36:45.240 --> 01:36:48.720]   So I agree with Jeff, it's an interesting play.
[01:36:48.720 --> 01:36:57.120]   It has, and it has that sort of weird, the thing I say about the geolocation stuff is
[01:36:57.120 --> 01:36:58.120]   it's the Harry Potter problem.
[01:36:58.120 --> 01:37:04.680]   It's like what you want as a user is the Weasley clock, not the Marauder's Map.
[01:37:04.680 --> 01:37:09.920]   You want to know that your family is safe and they're at home or at work or in Mortal
[01:37:09.920 --> 01:37:16.280]   Apparel or whatever, whereas you don't want to have somebody who's able to see everyone
[01:37:16.280 --> 01:37:19.160]   in the world and where they're moving on what they're doing.
[01:37:19.160 --> 01:37:24.000]   And Dennis has been very good at sort of walking the line between those two and making
[01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:27.040]   something useful here.
[01:37:27.040 --> 01:37:31.040]   And I do like that we're able to build stuff around the API to pull this back to our own
[01:37:31.040 --> 01:37:34.080]   sites and keep that data personal as well.
[01:37:34.080 --> 01:37:35.880]   Fascinating stuff.
[01:37:35.880 --> 01:37:40.960]   The API is still free for small sites and small use, so you can still play with it.
[01:37:40.960 --> 01:37:41.960]   Yeah.
[01:37:41.960 --> 01:37:42.960]   Nice.
[01:37:42.960 --> 01:37:48.160]   The other data they have that's actually fascinating is they have a database of every
[01:37:48.160 --> 01:37:51.680]   small business in America and mostly around the world as well.
[01:37:51.680 --> 01:37:54.680]   And I was always fascinated that they didn't do more with that.
[01:37:54.680 --> 01:38:00.400]   If I was a sales rep who had to target a certain kind of business, Four Square would give me
[01:38:00.400 --> 01:38:05.200]   those locations to tell me where they are and tell me who's rated them highly and lowly.
[01:38:05.200 --> 01:38:10.240]   And they're very, very good at it.
[01:38:10.240 --> 01:38:12.800]   I don't have anything for On Four Square.
[01:38:12.800 --> 01:38:13.800]   Sorry.
[01:38:13.800 --> 01:38:34.520]   My tip has nothing to do with X-
[01:38:34.520 --> 01:38:38.520]   Remains to be seen how awesome the apps are that end up in there.
[01:38:38.520 --> 01:38:44.240]   I have not played Adventure Time card wars, normally $2.99, now free for the week.
[01:38:44.240 --> 01:38:48.080]   I think it turns around on Thursdays.
[01:38:48.080 --> 01:38:53.120]   So you'll get a new, there will be a new free app of the week inserted every Thursday through
[01:38:53.120 --> 01:38:54.520]   the Play Store.
[01:38:54.520 --> 01:38:59.840]   But hey, a way to kind of shine a light on some paid apps and save yourself some money.
[01:38:59.840 --> 01:39:05.880]   And I think at least right now, developers, like Google's reaching out to developers to
[01:39:05.880 --> 01:39:09.280]   set up these deals to feature them here.
[01:39:09.280 --> 01:39:14.680]   And I don't think that developers are reimbursed for any of the installs in the way that I
[01:39:14.680 --> 01:39:21.120]   believe Amazon does with developers that are featured for free through their service.
[01:39:21.120 --> 01:39:25.360]   I don't get that on the Google side yet, but I think they're kind of playing around with
[01:39:25.360 --> 01:39:26.360]   this.
[01:39:26.360 --> 01:39:32.240]   They've done this, man, they did this like a year ago with educational apps or something.
[01:39:32.240 --> 01:39:36.120]   I want to say there was like a Daniel Tiger thing that was normally a paid app and they
[01:39:36.120 --> 01:39:39.400]   featured it for free and they tried a couple of other things around that time.
[01:39:39.400 --> 01:39:43.880]   So it seems like they're playing around with that again and possibly going to spend more
[01:39:43.880 --> 01:39:47.480]   time focused on featuring paid apps for free.
[01:39:47.480 --> 01:39:50.600]   So I want to save a few bucks.
[01:39:50.600 --> 01:39:51.600]   There you go.
[01:39:51.600 --> 01:39:54.880]   Check it out every week and see what they have in store for you there.
[01:39:54.880 --> 01:39:59.840]   And who knows, maybe, maybe a four square will end up there or a four square related
[01:39:59.840 --> 01:40:03.320]   app that you would normally have to pay for.
[01:40:03.320 --> 01:40:08.680]   But that as they say is that I think we've done good you guys.
[01:40:08.680 --> 01:40:16.720]   Thank you for hopping on and talking Samsung and Google and privacy and all and four square.
[01:40:16.720 --> 01:40:19.560]   Really appreciate it.
[01:40:19.560 --> 01:40:25.160]   Jeff Jarvis, of course, Buzzmachine.com, professor at the CUNY School of Journalism.
[01:40:25.160 --> 01:40:26.160]   What are you working on these days?
[01:40:26.160 --> 01:40:28.200]   What do you want to tell people about?
[01:40:28.200 --> 01:40:31.360]   Oh, I'll have something soon.
[01:40:31.360 --> 01:40:33.440]   Oh, okay.
[01:40:33.440 --> 01:40:34.440]   I'm intrigued.
[01:40:34.440 --> 01:40:37.600]   It's too bad we don't have that now, but I understand.
[01:40:37.600 --> 01:40:40.120]   I understand Jeff.
[01:40:40.120 --> 01:40:41.120]   Maybe next week.
[01:40:41.120 --> 01:40:42.120]   I don't know.
[01:40:42.120 --> 01:40:45.240]   You're going to have to tune in to find back.
[01:40:45.240 --> 01:40:46.240]   Shoot that's right.
[01:40:46.240 --> 01:40:47.240]   We'll be on next week.
[01:40:47.240 --> 01:40:48.240]   Oh, that's right.
[01:40:48.240 --> 01:40:53.160]   Yeah, well, Lloyd, a peruja for the National Journalism Festival.
[01:40:53.160 --> 01:40:54.160]   Nice.
[01:40:54.160 --> 01:40:55.160]   Have a good time there.
[01:40:55.160 --> 01:40:56.160]   I'm sure Pepe.
[01:40:56.160 --> 01:40:57.160]   I have lots of Caccio Pepe.
[01:40:57.160 --> 01:41:00.160]   Those pasta, cheese and pepper.
[01:41:00.160 --> 01:41:01.800]   Oh, that sounds good.
[01:41:01.800 --> 01:41:04.280]   I'm a little too unperuja.
[01:41:04.280 --> 01:41:06.400]   Sounds fantastic.
[01:41:06.400 --> 01:41:08.240]   Have a wonderful time.
[01:41:08.240 --> 01:41:12.120]   I'm sure next week's show is in good hands and then you'll be back the following week.
[01:41:12.120 --> 01:41:15.440]   Maybe you can pull the veil off of the secret then.
[01:41:15.440 --> 01:41:17.880]   We'll have to find out.
[01:41:17.880 --> 01:41:21.000]   So Kevin Marks, of course, Kevinmarks.com.
[01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000]   Really great doing another show with you, Kevin.
[01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:24.320]   Thanks for hopping on today.
[01:41:24.320 --> 01:41:29.360]   Tell people what you want them to know about what you're working on.
[01:41:29.360 --> 01:41:33.880]   I want to mention indyweb.org, which is the thing that I've been working for a while.
[01:41:33.880 --> 01:41:38.840]   It is this movement to get people back to having stuff on their own sites again.
[01:41:38.840 --> 01:41:41.760]   And there's a continuous chat.
[01:41:41.760 --> 01:41:44.840]   A lot of code being built, the hundreds of new papers, part of that.
[01:41:44.840 --> 01:41:49.080]   And also regular meetings in lots of cities around the world.
[01:41:49.080 --> 01:41:52.200]   So go to indyweb.org and have a look at that.
[01:41:52.200 --> 01:41:59.160]   See if it inspires you to build your own website and connect things to it.
[01:41:59.160 --> 01:42:00.160]   Fantastic.
[01:42:00.160 --> 01:42:01.160]   Check that out.
[01:42:01.160 --> 01:42:02.920]   And again, Kevin, thank you.
[01:42:02.920 --> 01:42:03.920]   This is a lot of fun.
[01:42:03.920 --> 01:42:05.920]   Really appreciate it.
[01:42:05.920 --> 01:42:07.480]   Well, I'm here.
[01:42:07.480 --> 01:42:08.560]   I work here at Twit.
[01:42:08.560 --> 01:42:09.560]   I'm on a lot of shows.
[01:42:09.560 --> 01:42:11.560]   In fact, I'm going to do tech news today next.
[01:42:11.560 --> 01:42:14.520]   So catch me on tech news today.
[01:42:14.520 --> 01:42:15.520]   That's where you can find me.
[01:42:15.520 --> 01:42:20.000]   Twit.tv/tnt as well as all about Android here and find me on Twitter.
[01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:21.000]   I'm @JasonHowell.
[01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.400]   Leo's back next week.
[01:42:23.400 --> 01:42:26.440]   So you'll have him sitting at the helm of this show then.
[01:42:26.440 --> 01:42:27.440]   So expect him then.
[01:42:27.440 --> 01:42:33.440]   Twig, of course, records every Wednesday at 1.30 p.m. Pacific, 4.30 p.m. Eastern.
[01:42:33.440 --> 01:42:37.160]   And I believe right now it's about what is it?
[01:42:37.160 --> 01:42:40.360]   Oh, I have the wrong UTC time.
[01:42:40.360 --> 01:42:42.880]   I don't think it's 20.30 UTC.
[01:42:42.880 --> 01:42:45.200]   But you probably know better than I do.
[01:42:45.200 --> 01:42:46.200]   Join live at Twit.
[01:42:46.200 --> 01:42:47.200]   What is it?
[01:42:47.200 --> 01:42:49.120]   Help me.
[01:42:49.120 --> 01:42:50.120]   If you know.
[01:42:50.120 --> 01:42:53.600]   It was 21.30 UTC.
[01:42:53.600 --> 01:42:54.600]   I think.
[01:42:54.600 --> 01:42:55.600]   OK, so I was an hour off.
[01:42:55.600 --> 01:42:57.080]   That was when we started.
[01:42:57.080 --> 01:42:58.080]   Yeah.
[01:42:58.080 --> 01:42:59.080]   21.30.
[01:42:59.080 --> 01:43:00.080]   We did just change this week.
[01:43:00.080 --> 01:43:01.080]   Yeah, I know.
[01:43:01.080 --> 01:43:02.080]   It's very confusing.
[01:43:02.080 --> 01:43:03.520]   But 21.30 is the new number.
[01:43:03.520 --> 01:43:05.320]   It's currently 11.18 p.m.
[01:43:05.320 --> 01:43:06.320]   All right.
[01:43:06.320 --> 01:43:09.960]   Which means that Kevin's going to get to sleep sometime soon.
[01:43:09.960 --> 01:43:11.320]   You could join live, of course.
[01:43:11.320 --> 01:43:19.760]   If you want to catch it live, twit.tv/live, you can find the show on demand at twit.tv/twig.
[01:43:19.760 --> 01:43:20.760]   Just go there.
[01:43:20.760 --> 01:43:21.760]   All of our episodes.
[01:43:21.760 --> 01:43:23.600]   You can subscribe to our episodes.
[01:43:23.600 --> 01:43:24.920]   Catch up on back episodes.
[01:43:24.920 --> 01:43:26.480]   Start with episode one.
[01:43:26.480 --> 01:43:27.480]   Whatever floats your boat.
[01:43:27.480 --> 01:43:28.480]   It's all there.
[01:43:28.480 --> 01:43:29.480]   Twit.tv/twig.
[01:43:29.480 --> 01:43:33.000]   And I think that's all she wrote.
[01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:36.920]   So we'll see you guys next week on This Week in Google.
[01:43:36.920 --> 01:43:37.720]   Bye, you guys.
[01:43:37.720 --> 01:43:47.720]   [MUSIC]
