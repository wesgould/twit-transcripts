[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.680]   It's time for Twig this week at Google we got the band back together against Asezy Higginbotham, Jeff Jarvis
[00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.760]   There's lots of Google News new Google products to talk about
[00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.520]   You know what let's not delay it's gonna be a great show this week in Google. What's next?
[00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:21.280]   Netcast you love from people you trust

[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:41.280]   This is Twig this week in Google episode
[00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.640]   377 recorded Wednesday November 2nd
[00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.440]   2016
[00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.840]   Google throne

[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.280]   It's time for twig this weekend Google the show where we talk about the latest
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.400]   really not from Google, but everything the latest everything because
[00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.320]   This is this is kind of our most far-ranging show that talks a lot about
[00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.120]   society and
[00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.320]   journalism
[00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.120]   social media course Google Facebook all that too and
[00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.800]   Partly that's because when you have such a great panel of people always smart interesting people you're gonna talk about whatever it is
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.760]   It's on our minds on their minds Stacey Higginbotham is here Stacey on IOT
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:02.800]   Haven't talked to you Stacey since the IOT debacle of
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:09.840]   2016 so let's we'll talk about that in a moment, but also let me introduce mr. Jeff Jarvis back home after his
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.640]   John's
[00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.520]   Around the globe he's professor of journalism is in his office at CUNY. Yeah
[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.920]   also blocks at buzz machine calm and
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:25.200]   There's written many many wonderful books including what would Google do public parts ski-expering gifts about the new
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.200]   Reinventing the news business hello you too. I missed you. We got the man back together. I love it
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:36.520]   Hello, hello, I'm excited to be back because it means I'm home you've been traveling on you're gonna travel again
[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:42.840]   You're going to San Francisco next week. I am but then I'm done really that's it for this for the season for the season
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.040]   CES is see what CES will be the next thing so good
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.320]   Stacey will be hosting several panels at the structure conference in San Francisco this is coming week
[00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.080]   election day I
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:01.840]   Would like to be at a conference on election day and the day after I would like to be with a large group of people because I think it's just
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.840]   It's fascinating
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:09.040]   To this David Kirk Patrick has his conference the day after election day. What's his conference?
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:17.760]   Economy oh, I'm gonna be at that one too. Oh, you are traveling. Where's that? I think it's at half moon day. Oh
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:25.200]   So you can go south, but not north is that what you're saying? I'm pretty sure it's somewhere outside of San Francisco
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.200]   Jeff don't tell me like I just got something wrong the other day and I had to switch some flights so
[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.640]   Economy not as bad as Paul, Toronto actually
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.780]   Went to the airport and realized he hadn't booked a flight
[00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.780]   Just
[00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.240]   Somewhere and just I guess assumed that there'd be a plane for him
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:48.860]   Mark Zuckerberg is gonna be at that I know
[00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:54.020]   Mark Zuckerberg since 2008 he likes to David
[00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:56.740]   Yeah
[00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:59.400]   Very very very good. Can't wait
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:05.180]   Anyway, but I do want to go back in time a couple of weeks because
[00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:11.500]   Two weeks ago the internet sort of went down at least got slowed down a lot Spotify Twitter
[00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.100]   github
[00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:16.780]   because of an attack a denial of service attack on
[00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:19.300]   Dine DNS which
[00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:24.100]   What is a one of the major DNS providers apparently for those companies?
[00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:33.580]   And it turned out the attack was originated from Internet of Things devices particularly camera and routers made by a Chinese company called
[00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:37.460]   Shanghai and then sold by a variety of different companies and
[00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:42.060]   I'm gonna argue with you already. Yes
[00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:49.700]   These are not Internet of Things devices. They're devices that happen to be on the Internet. Okay, keep going. That's actually one of the things
[00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:56.340]   Okay, no, no, no, no dig down on that. Okay. That's one of the things that came up was what is an Internet of Things device?
[00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:01.980]   Okay, so let me say why this was an issue
[00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:11.500]   These simple dumb devices are often manufactured in the millions sold in the millions IDG and now estimates
[00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:20.260]   Six and a half billion and this is probably where this definition is critical IOT devices and another something like five and a half million a day
[00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:21.740]   Going online
[00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:29.820]   These devices typically are made cheaply sold cheaply and never updated often they have the default password built in
[00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:33.100]   To firmware that was the problem with these shung my devices
[00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:38.060]   So it's easy for a virus like Mirai the virus that was used in this attack
[00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:44.660]   So just scan the Internet law try logging in via telnet and get in and then put a virus on these devices in fact
[00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:49.740]   These devices are so simple that the virus sits in RAM. So if you reboot the device
[00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:52.900]   It just it's clean
[00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:57.220]   But it's then sitting on the Internet ready to be hacked one more time
[00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:02.660]   So the what happens with this is because there are so many of them you can compromise a
[00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:09.460]   Great number of devices which makes it much easier to do a DDoS attack these devices sent GRE packets
[00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:13.700]   Which were routing packets to dine DNS packets that could not ignore
[00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:18.060]   Nor could it block because it was coming from so many IP addresses
[00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:22.380]   So first thing is IDG's estimate of IOT devices
[00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:28.700]   I mentioned that on Twitter I think on Sunday and everybody said that's that can't possibly be right
[00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:31.580]   Stay six and a half billion. Yeah
[00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:34.180]   Well, okay
[00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:39.820]   There's so much to unpack here. Yes. I feel like I'm just gonna be beaten on a wall, but let's let's start
[00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:42.620]   All right
[00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:45.860]   These devices so this is one type of attack
[00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:52.100]   So we're killing all of the Internet of things based on the devices that are on the Internet being used in a DDoS
[00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:58.940]   So we're gonna talk only about DDoS is we're not gonna talk about other security issues with IOT. So that's parameter number one
[00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:01.420]   number two
[00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:03.420]   These devices are routers
[00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:10.140]   they're network DVR so they're security cameras and they're also there are a couple printers in the list
[00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:14.180]   These are devices that connect directly to the Internet. They don't
[00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:17.620]   most what I would think of as a modern kind of
[00:07:18.420 --> 00:07:22.580]   Internet of things device that we typically talk about when we think about these things
[00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:27.860]   Those connect either through a server so they've got a different type of architecture
[00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:31.300]   So they don't connect directly out or they might even connect through a hub
[00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:34.280]   The other thing to know about these is they're
[00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:38.100]   They're Linux servers. These are not like a light bulb
[00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:41.660]   Your light bulb is gonna be freaking useless if it were part of a DDoS attack
[00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:44.580]   It just doesn't have a GRE packet or even a set packet. Yeah
[00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:48.620]   So those are a couple things to keep in mind. I'm not saying this is great
[00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:56.620]   This is really truly sucky and I'm kind of glad it happened because people have been putting stuff online for decades that are not
[00:07:56.620 --> 00:08:05.500]   Secure so hard-coded passwords in these routers dumb. I mean, Mariah just goes through in the source code for Mariah
[00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:11.020]   You know basically creates all these bots. That's why when you when you reboot it in like 10 minutes or so
[00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:14.700]   It's gonna get infected again because you know, you're not even dealing with a person
[00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:19.020]   You're dealing with bots that are like boop boop. Are you open? Are you open? Yes infected?
[00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:21.140]   so I
[00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:26.940]   Don't know. Okay, so that's that's kind of all of that and I just I get really frustrated because
[00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:33.140]   We haven't been building things securely for a while right? I mean you don't have to defend IOT
[00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:36.860]   This isn't an attack on IOT. It's merely an attack on poorly designed IOT
[00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:41.220]   And it's not even IOT. It's just poorly designed connected crap, right?
[00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:48.180]   I mean these are cheap knock cheap devices for the most part. Well, how do you define an Internet of Things device?
[00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:51.180]   Well up until now
[00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:55.560]   I've never I don't even call things an Internet of Things device to be totally honest
[00:08:55.560 --> 00:09:01.500]   I have a podcast called IOT. Yeah, I do it's called the Internet of Things and when I define the Internet of Things
[00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:04.020]   I'm not enough in its Seinfeld. Don't you get it?
[00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:09.860]   But what it so what are the devices you cover on the IOT podcast? Those are Internet of Things devices, yes
[00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:15.660]   Most of my devices are smart home stuff or sensors and buildings so there is you're right those devices
[00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:22.900]   Can't be used in this kind of attack. However, they are they do still pose security vulnerabilities for instance because
[00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:31.540]   They are on your network if they can be compromised a bad guy can use them to then compromise other devices on your network or hacking
[00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:39.940]   So they because they're sitting on the Internet in a way that isn't necessarily particularly secure. They offer a vulnerability. I
[00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:42.700]   Think the issue is one
[00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:48.180]   There's all what you can't secure anything anymore for the most part. There's this sense of like
[00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:52.700]   Security is no longer a set it and forget it. It's an ongoing
[00:09:52.700 --> 00:10:00.220]   Challenge, right? So if you're gonna build a product and connect it to the Internet you have to be prepared to conduct
[00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:05.020]   Pin testing every you know, however long I mean I would agree with you
[00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:10.900]   But but but you can cover 99% of the cases with some very
[00:10:10.900 --> 00:10:13.700]   simple things that even
[00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:19.220]   Even those things aren't being done for instance having firmware that's updatable
[00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:22.620]   You all those shung my devices are now being recalled
[00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:27.820]   They're hoping and of course it will not happen people will send them back to get the firmware updated so
[00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:32.940]   Rule one like the ring doorbell you have to be able to be updated remotely
[00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:35.540]   So that if something's just
[00:10:35.540 --> 00:10:39.780]   Fixed people out that also frees people out. Well understand what it has to happen
[00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:45.460]   It's not it's just like windows has to be updated these devices have to be updated acknowledging what you just said Stacy
[00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:52.860]   Nothing's perfect - they can't have hardwired packed or passwords. That's ridiculous in this day and age
[00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:58.660]   I would say that's number one. Okay, maybe even yeah, I mean, that's just so stupid you're right
[00:10:58.660 --> 00:11:04.060]   Don't tape your front key to the door. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's exactly what it is, dude
[00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:09.580]   Okay, so there but you do the basics you're going to thwart a lot of this stuff
[00:11:09.580 --> 00:11:13.740]   I mean, it's not it's not I mean there are of course lots of edge cases
[00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:21.220]   We're seeing that now with operating systems from Microsoft and software from big companies Google and others
[00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:28.740]   That is really well written software the latest attack on Android D. Rama is a highly sophisticated attack
[00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:36.020]   Not that a script kitty couldn't do it once it's been weaponized, but it's a it's incredibly sophisticated and yes
[00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:39.420]   You can you know, there's always gonna be stuff like that, but you can eliminate the
[00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:42.340]   vast majority of problems
[00:11:42.340 --> 00:11:45.060]   With some simple stuff
[00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:48.420]   Yeah, here's what you should look for. Oh, which is my specialty. Yeah
[00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:51.740]   So what I want to understand this first from the other side for one second
[00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:58.740]   What do you have to do to fix the internet so that it is not vulnerable to DDoS attacks?
[00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:01.340]   You can't
[00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:04.780]   There are things you could do, but it's very hard. So
[00:12:04.780 --> 00:12:07.340]   Stephen I talked about this on security now a lot
[00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:11.780]   We talked about it recently in the last two weeks one thing used to be if you just made ISPs
[00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:14.380]   reject traffic
[00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:19.780]   That that was spoofed that can't a spoofed IP address that didn't come from their network
[00:12:19.780 --> 00:12:24.820]   So if you're calm cast and you say outbound traffic from Comcast has to come from a compact array the compass
[00:12:24.820 --> 00:12:29.620]   Comcast range of IP addresses are gonna reject it that would have helped until
[00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:32.460]   these days because
[00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:37.740]   Initially all these DDoS attacks had to come from computers and so they had to spoof their IP address
[00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:40.580]   Otherwise, it would be easier to stop them now because of the
[00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:46.260]   miniferation of small internet connected devices they don't they no longer spoof their address
[00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:50.060]   They're coming from real addresses because there's so many of them. You can block it doesn't matter
[00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:54.220]   So now one thing Steve and I talked about yesterday is routers
[00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:59.620]   Should probably have some software on them that watches for this kind of outbound
[00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:01.900]   traffic yes
[00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:06.340]   Because just as an ISP should be responsible for traffic exiting their network
[00:13:06.340 --> 00:13:11.180]   You probably should be responsible for traffic exiting your home your home router your home router your home router to
[00:13:11.180 --> 00:13:16.340]   And again, this is like cherry-picking there's gonna always be edge cases of things that are gonna get by this
[00:13:16.340 --> 00:13:24.060]   But if you get the vast majority it really improves things because the reason I'm asking that is is that if you have a bunch of dumb crappy
[00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:28.180]   Cameras out there
[00:13:28.180 --> 00:13:35.100]   Trying to get dumb crappy hardware made better is gonna be really hard to do it strikes me that that you've got to try to fix it
[00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:38.380]   At a different point. Yeah, there's always gonna be dumb crappy crap out there
[00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:41.060]   So we talked about this
[00:13:41.060 --> 00:13:43.060]   dumb crappy crap
[00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:47.220]   So I talked about this with Andy Ellis who is the CSO at Akabai
[00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:50.780]   Chiefs CSO CTO CSO
[00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:57.740]   And he also pointed out that this is while these attacks are huge today in a couple of years
[00:13:57.740 --> 00:14:02.540]   They're not gonna be as significant because the internet itself will be bigger
[00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:08.260]   So everything will scale up which is kind of an interesting and super hopeful statement
[00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:10.940]   Especially because he was like, you know, we're not gonna be able to stop this
[00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:14.620]   There are things you can do like some of the things Leo mentioned
[00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:20.820]   He's right hitting yeah, I know he's super smart and he's Akabai, but
[00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:28.340]   There are still the problem really is that for instance DNS servers. This is a there's a small number of these
[00:14:28.340 --> 00:14:32.420]   the 13 canonical DNS networks are
[00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:35.780]   are vulnerable because there's 13 of them and
[00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:39.020]   You can say the internet scaling up, but it's gonna be bigger
[00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:44.460]   But what he's I think what he's saying is he's pitching a
[00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:51.180]   point of view that comes from CDNs and from it does and yeah comes from companies like Cloudflare which is oh
[00:14:51.180 --> 00:14:53.500]   Don't worry about fixing security
[00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:59.620]   We're just gonna mitigate by throwing bandwidth at it and I think that that is a very very attitude
[00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:05.820]   So I'm not saying that we should not do security but getting an ISP's to like black ports is
[00:15:06.140 --> 00:15:11.380]   Is actually quite difficult his other solution was actually to charge them for it. I don't know if you guys remember
[00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:14.780]   Was a good that's how you get him to do it. Yeah. Yeah, yeah spam
[00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:18.980]   Yeah, we remember when spam was like a big deal and they started like
[00:15:18.980 --> 00:15:24.220]   sending packets back to I see I want to block port 25 for ages the
[00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:28.180]   SMTP port because they didn't want to pay for the and think about it
[00:15:28.180 --> 00:15:34.140]   If you have millions of customers the tech support costs are not insignificant when they call up and say why is my mail server not working?
[00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:41.340]   But they eventually did they were forced to buy things like this and they now do you can't run a mail server on your Comcast network for that reason
[00:15:41.340 --> 00:15:49.100]   Which is upsetting to I mean it's it's it'd be nice if people could run servers on their homes for things and would be
[00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:53.780]   That'd be great. I'm gonna push you though on the IOT things Stacy
[00:15:53.780 --> 00:15:58.860]   I know that you know, you don't want anything to hurt the ecosystem of IOT but
[00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:08.020]   But really this is a recipe for disaster read at what regardless of what you were Andy says putting all of these dumb cheap devices
[00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:10.860]   online is a
[00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:19.220]   recipe for disaster. This is not something that can be ignored at this point. So we should have I am actually a huge believer in
[00:16:19.220 --> 00:16:23.380]   I'll just say it finds out the wazoo for
[00:16:23.380 --> 00:16:25.700]   poorly designed
[00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:31.140]   devices and services and block it or say you can't sell it anymore in the u.s. But but but but
[00:16:31.140 --> 00:16:39.020]   Well, I was gonna say most of the Mariah botnet computers now aren't even in the u.s
[00:16:39.020 --> 00:16:42.900]   So they're coming from all of you can't block the say
[00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:48.220]   I'm saying you can try to fix the crappy crap or you try to fix the throughput or you can fix the target
[00:16:48.220 --> 00:16:51.060]   It's a good point
[00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:53.060]   So I mean
[00:16:53.300 --> 00:16:55.300]   All of it. I mean
[00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:59.340]   But the same problem I have with the fact that if somebody has your name and your source security number they can ruin your life
[00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:05.380]   What's wrong with that picture right right that we should you shouldn't be able to do a transaction with such little information?
[00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:08.460]   You got to fix the transactional requirements
[00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:13.340]   So that simple little leaks are gonna be a problem anymore same here
[00:17:13.340 --> 00:17:17.820]   if if just simply being able to throw out a volume of
[00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:22.020]   Pings is gonna bring down the whole freakin internet then that's something
[00:17:22.500 --> 00:17:25.740]   And a nuclear attack won't something's wrong with that picture. Yeah
[00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:35.260]   Okay, yes, but I will say a lot of companies are doing fine things and I want it if you want to have a connected device
[00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:38.300]   Here's what you should look for. Let me just give you some takeaways here
[00:17:38.300 --> 00:17:40.980]   No hard-coded passwords
[00:17:40.980 --> 00:17:48.500]   Things that when you install the device it forces you to change a password new links as routers do this for example
[00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:53.800]   You want a vendor that allows over the air updates so they can switch things because that's gonna happen
[00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:56.260]   you also want a vendor that is
[00:17:56.260 --> 00:18:02.900]   Monitoring things and you may not know this or you know a lot of the major
[00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:11.620]   Companies who offer these devices have some sort of monitoring system to see what their devices are doing and if something happens with them
[00:18:11.620 --> 00:18:15.220]   And you also want to have a bug bounty or security program
[00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:21.780]   So people can report things to you without being worried about being sued for example, so
[00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:27.580]   Those are in then as a consumer you should pay for quality and
[00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:33.100]   if you're in this is hard because like if you're an SMB and you're buying a network DVR
[00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:35.660]   You're looking for what's resolution?
[00:18:35.660 --> 00:18:37.980]   you know
[00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:45.020]   What can how many how many like how much memory do I have on this thing and then how much does it cost you're not saying I?
[00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:52.760]   Gosh, this is gonna open right am I gonna help take down the internet with this part of the problem with this
[00:18:52.760 --> 00:18:59.740]   In several of the things you just talked about is that the people who have to make that buying decision don't pay the price for?
[00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:02.660]   the security problems they're causing oh
[00:19:02.660 --> 00:19:05.780]   Oh in somebody pointing this out. I forgot to say it again
[00:19:05.780 --> 00:19:13.540]   Having the ability to monitor your network traffic to see if it's spiking because otherwise you're never gonna know because it's not
[00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:20.740]   Right, so that's important. I don't think that's out. Do you know of any routers or anything? Oh, yeah a lot of routers will do that
[00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:27.940]   Huh? Yeah, go check mine. They're the more expensive more complicated more difficult to use routers. I
[00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:34.580]   Think there's some hope in this new category of routers like the Iro and the the luma
[00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:43.500]   Linksys is doing one like that where they're managed not by you, but by the manufacturer, so
[00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:49.740]   Iro has a very simple and there is sponsor I should mention Iro has a very simple app
[00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:52.900]   That really doesn't give you a huge amount of capability
[00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:56.300]   Certainly doesn't let you kind of do that kind of monitoring of things
[00:19:56.300 --> 00:20:02.700]   But they have the ability to mod because you're logged into the euro account to do that now whether they do I don't know but
[00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:12.380]   That's one way to solve this is I mean if you're a business you don't the owner of the business isn't paying attention to security
[00:20:12.380 --> 00:20:17.980]   That you hire people to do that for you and you use appliance, you know, we have big security
[00:20:17.980 --> 00:20:22.980]   Appliances between twit in the outside world and we have a professional guy running it
[00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:25.780]   That's how a business does it
[00:20:25.780 --> 00:20:27.900]   if you're a home you need that kind of
[00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:30.820]   Support you can't be expected to do that. I don't think
[00:20:30.820 --> 00:20:36.460]   Why do you think our internet service and our Wi-Fi is going to be delivered as a service going forward?
[00:20:36.460 --> 00:20:37.340]   Yeah, there you go
[00:20:37.340 --> 00:20:43.140]   So that's the way to describe what I just said, but then people are gonna be pissed because people still don't want to pay
[00:20:43.140 --> 00:20:48.060]   Like I'm constantly shocked at people when I'm like, oh, yeah my arrows
[00:20:48.060 --> 00:20:50.940]   They were like 500 bucks for three too much. I know
[00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:58.820]   We're cables going right cables being forced by the FCC to let you buy your cable box rather than leasing it
[00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:01.220]   What you're basically saying Leo is you're leasing the service
[00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:05.460]   And it's another damn monthly fee and we'll get ripped off for it
[00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:11.020]   Well, you don't have to get ripped off for it. Maybe your cable provider doesn't actually provide you the Wi-Fi service
[00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:17.620]   Maybe you get it from another company. It doesn't have to come from I asked be very helpful here because they see all that outbound traffic
[00:21:17.620 --> 00:21:20.300]   Yeah, you know, they really are very active on this
[00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:23.740]   Yeah, aren't they?
[00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:27.220]   Well, anyway, I just it's a old somewhat old news
[00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:32.140]   But I we weren't around and I really wanted to get your your take on it. I'm glad I asked
[00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:39.020]   You have a lot to say about it. I have a pigeons and I believe you probably in Kevin talk about it on your IOT podcast
[00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:41.500]   We did I actually had
[00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:46.820]   Two security guests. Yeah, one's one's actually coming out this week. So good. Good. Good. Good. Good
[00:21:46.820 --> 00:21:49.220]   You're much more up on it than I am probably
[00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:56.020]   Although we do talk about all of this quite a bit on security now as well. This is oh, yeah, no better place
[00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:58.020]   a big a big source of our
[00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:00.980]   conversation
[00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:05.140]   Does Steve ever get scared? He never shows it
[00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:09.220]   But I often do
[00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:16.140]   And and I ask him are we losing you know and things like that, but he's no he's he's extremely
[00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:23.300]   Positive about what we can do he often if we have a little segment called you're doing it wrong
[00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:28.900]   He'll often call out people who just are kind of incredibly stupid
[00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:34.540]   But you know a lot of what we talk about nowadays and this is I don't think this this is kind of what I was alluding to is
[00:22:34.540 --> 00:22:38.460]   That hack the hackers white and black hat
[00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:44.580]   Are becoming incredibly sophisticated in their ability to suss out problems?
[00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:48.540]   That they could take advantage of if you look at how this D. Ramer
[00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:55.860]   exploit works on Android and this is the exploit that that is potentially
[00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:02.680]   Going to be a huge problem for all Android phones because it's it's hardware based
[00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:05.420]   it it is
[00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:08.060]   incredibly
[00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:11.300]   Sophisticate I don't even know how they figured this out
[00:23:11.300 --> 00:23:16.900]   And I couldn't in any cogent way describe this to you in less than 20 minutes
[00:23:16.900 --> 00:23:23.020]   But it is it's a bit flip in RAM basically that they use then to root a phone and that be
[00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:30.100]   If as it's once it's weaponized that technique can be used to root your phone remotely in minutes seconds even and
[00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:33.740]   The problem is very hard to fix and according to some
[00:23:33.740 --> 00:23:39.780]   It's not really clear that even the Google pixel is affected by this and it's you can mitigate a little bit with firmware updates
[00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:45.820]   But not a hundred percent so the Nexus 4 the Nexus 5 the G4 from LG Moto G
[00:23:45.820 --> 00:23:51.020]   From last year in the year before the Galaxy S4 the S5 the one from one plus
[00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:55.220]   All have been successfully rooted
[00:23:55.220 --> 00:24:03.620]   Using the D. Ramer tool and this this requires me to download an app though, right? Right so it'd be a malicious app got it
[00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:08.260]   I always I always like knowing what I should avoid yeah, there's so we often talk about this
[00:24:08.260 --> 00:24:11.820]   There's there's there's exploits and a lot of exploits require physical access
[00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:18.380]   I don't worry so much about those there's exploits that require you to do something stupid like most windows malware
[00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:22.860]   Requires you to execute a program on your computer, but then there are worms network
[00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:28.740]   Based attacks like Mirai that require no interactivity on your part
[00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:31.660]   That's scary and those are the most you also add in there
[00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:37.240]   Fishing requires you to say something stupid right stage fright which predated D
[00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:43.660]   Ramer could be could happen to you from a malicious MMS that you wouldn't have to open or look at
[00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:50.260]   Because the way the media player worked on Android is it would automatically rendered that MMS
[00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:53.660]   Prerender it download it pre-render it before you looked at it
[00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:58.980]   So that's an example of an exploit that did involve downloading something on your on your phone
[00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:01.500]   But you didn't have to do anything you didn't have to install an app or anything
[00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:08.020]   That's what I did but that was fixable and has been and for anything new been fixed problem with course with Android
[00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:11.060]   There's a lot of older stuff that will never be fixed a similar to IOT
[00:25:11.340 --> 00:25:17.940]   Where a lot of Android devices are very inexpensive phones the manufacturer the carrier and the user are not gonna fix it
[00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:20.340]   And so they're gonna be sitting out there forever
[00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:22.820]   Here's another thing about this though
[00:25:22.820 --> 00:25:30.340]   Worth mentioning not we assume it's cheap stuff, but actually I saw on the list of devices the ubiquity
[00:25:30.340 --> 00:25:36.180]   Yeah, router and I was like what the heck is that doing there? There is a fix for that
[00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:40.740]   We talked about that yesterday as well. Okay, but it requires you running you have to update your firmware
[00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:43.100]   You have to download a shell script update your firmware
[00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:44.140]   like right
[00:25:44.140 --> 00:25:48.820]   But the thinking was one that a lot of these there are some of these not all of them are
[00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:56.140]   Designed for sitting in an enterprise where they have someone who's monitoring the traffic and who's doing a lot of this stuff that a
[00:25:56.140 --> 00:26:03.780]   Whole motor isn't necessarily doing so my tip on that is be careful if you're buying enterprise care
[00:26:03.780 --> 00:26:09.140]   There is a point there assuming you're gonna keep it up today. Yeah, that's why I said very important
[00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:14.060]   IOT device needs to be able to be updated remotely firmware needs to be able to update remotely
[00:26:14.060 --> 00:26:18.940]   There was a problem with the ring doorbell another sponsor where if you took the doorbell off
[00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:23.020]   You could analyze it in such a ways to get the the homeowners
[00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:25.460]   Wi-Fi password login and password
[00:26:25.460 --> 00:26:27.740]   You'd have to remove it. You'd have to put it back
[00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:34.100]   it wasn't an easy exploit and it's my knowledge was never exploited because as soon as ring learned about it before it was public they
[00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:40.740]   Sent a patch down the line and all ring doorbells in the over patched and so as soon as you connect your new ring doorbell
[00:26:40.740 --> 00:26:44.020]   It's patched if it's not so that's that's very very important
[00:26:44.020 --> 00:26:44.220]   By the way
[00:26:44.220 --> 00:26:48.380]   I want to say one more thing about d-rammer because you said you have to download an app
[00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:55.440]   But if you combine it with something like stage fright which maliciously sends an MMS to an unpatched phone
[00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:58.300]   Stage fright can then be used to invoke d-rammer
[00:26:58.300 --> 00:27:00.020]   so
[00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:04.220]   This is why it's really dangerous you can you can daisy chain exploit
[00:27:04.220 --> 00:27:07.940]   So all you need is one wormish exploit that can be done without any interactivity
[00:27:07.940 --> 00:27:13.260]   So we are seeing d-rammer being used in the wild by taking advantage of the stage fright bug
[00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:15.260]   Which it gets it on the machine and then it's activated
[00:27:15.260 --> 00:27:23.420]   I'm the dumb question is my specialty. Yeah, what how does the doorbell?
[00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:26.660]   Mama prevent
[00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:32.040]   Fake mamas from coming in and downloading new mother's milk. I don't know. Sorry that one
[00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:35.300]   How does rain prevent
[00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:37.300]   But boy the phrasing was dope boy
[00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:46.340]   That's the second key which we've kind of alluded to which authentication is really important and all these things
[00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:48.340]   You can't have a default password
[00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:49.620]   So
[00:27:49.620 --> 00:27:55.840]   So it has to be built into the firmware of a doorbell that you know you don't take firmware updates from strangers is what you're saying
[00:27:55.980 --> 00:28:01.700]   You can only accept firmware updates that are signed by the manufacturer, but we have a good
[00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:05.860]   We have a very good mechanism for that kind of authentication Jeff. It's called
[00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:10.420]   Oh, it's excellent. PGP signature is excellent. Although
[00:28:10.420 --> 00:28:12.740]   Although
[00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:18.620]   This isn't this isn't for Wi-Fi and it's not a it's a it's a token issue. Sometimes people will do
[00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:24.980]   Manufacturers will get a little lazy and they'll just pick a default token. Oh, yeah, they use the same one on everything
[00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:26.980]   Yes, that we've seen as well
[00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:29.620]   Yeah, no good. I said good authentication
[00:28:29.620 --> 00:28:37.380]   Not not don't be authentication good authentication, but there are better. It's well known. They're very good authentication methods when I download
[00:28:37.380 --> 00:28:40.180]   updates for Linux for instance
[00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:44.740]   In every case or even install Linux in every case there's an authentication
[00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:52.340]   System that allows me to verify that that came from the person who says it came from came from the manufacturer. Oh
[00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:58.280]   Okay, okay. This is important. This is relevant. I was in DC yesterday
[00:28:58.280 --> 00:29:00.780]   I think it was yesterday and I was at a panel and
[00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:09.340]   One of the big topics thanks to Mariah was IOT security and I have to tell you guys that the Washington fix is not gonna come
[00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:14.220]   It's not happening because when I was doing this I was a amazed at how
[00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:19.180]   Wrong some of the information that was shared on the panel was but two two
[00:29:20.380 --> 00:29:25.420]   And there was okay, so there's a congressman staffer. There is a head of enforcement for the FCC
[00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:31.900]   There was a lawyer. There was the representative from the consumer electronics association that puts on CES
[00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:39.860]   And then there was someone for the Center for Democracy and Technology. See I may see DT see anyway, so that's the panelists
[00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:46.340]   They were focused only on the device. I asked about encryption, which you know in Washington is a problem
[00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:53.820]   And they didn't even want to talk about it and they even said the cloud security like securing database passwords and stuff in the cloud
[00:29:53.820 --> 00:29:59.060]   Was also not on the table. It was tangential and so
[00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:04.900]   That freaked me out to no end because these regulators are
[00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:10.820]   Trying to build laws they're trying to think about repercussions for things if you're the FTC for example
[00:30:10.820 --> 00:30:14.580]   You're thinking about fines and how to enforce things like
[00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:19.140]   maintaining good database or good password databases
[00:30:19.140 --> 00:30:23.100]   So so yeah, that's that was kind of a downer
[00:30:23.100 --> 00:30:27.220]   So I went to a conference today
[00:30:27.220 --> 00:30:33.140]   It's the four square conference not that four square but held by it was hard and it's off the record so I can't but last night
[00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:36.780]   Enter Ross or can interview John Brennan the head of the CIA
[00:30:36.780 --> 00:30:43.460]   Which it was fascinating and actually I was very impressed with Brennan was glad I was glad to say
[00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:47.280]   But the discussion that then and Sue is always in Susan these groups is
[00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:50.800]   You know
[00:30:50.800 --> 00:30:53.820]   encryption and back doors to encryption and is it really encryption and
[00:30:53.820 --> 00:30:59.540]   The desire to have secure systems and the desire to have local control
[00:30:59.540 --> 00:31:03.900]   It's just it's gonna be in constant constant conflict
[00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:11.540]   Okay, well, I don't know why you call me grumpy because you guys have just brought me down man
[00:31:11.540 --> 00:31:13.540]   I was all cherry and happy
[00:31:13.540 --> 00:31:17.100]   Are you serious device we can talk about yes, let's take a break
[00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:26.420]   Happy I got toys. Let's talk about toys actually I have the scariest story was not widely reported
[00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:28.980]   We talked a little bit about on Sunday the scariest story
[00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:34.540]   I think of the year coming up in just a second so stay tuned but first a word this is happy fresh books
[00:31:34.540 --> 00:31:39.060]   If you're a freelancer if you've got a small business, I can pretty much guarantee
[00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:46.060]   You didn't get in business because you love sending invoices and keeping track of finances and running your accounting
[00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:49.100]   Unless you're an accounting business, but then you're doing it for somebody else right
[00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:53.860]   I bet you people who run accounting businesses don't even do that like doing their own invoicing and accounting
[00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:57.100]   It's just not the fun part right so fresh books
[00:31:57.100 --> 00:32:01.060]   Let's you do the stuff you got into business to do the thing you really enjoy
[00:32:01.060 --> 00:32:05.340]   You're really good at and handles the stuff you need to do to keep the business running
[00:32:05.340 --> 00:32:12.980]   It started for me when I first started using fresh books 12 years ago for invoicing and it is simple and easy and wonderful
[00:32:12.980 --> 00:32:19.020]   But now fresh books has been completely redesigned to give you so much more
[00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:21.860]   They've launched the all new version of their cloud accounting software
[00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:25.620]   By the way if you're an existing fresh books user you can stay with the old interface if you want
[00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:32.180]   But you should try the new one because it's been redesigned from the ground up to be to fit the way you work
[00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:35.780]   So that you don't feel like you're doing accounting
[00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:38.380]   But I'll give you an example that was talking to the fresh books guy
[00:32:38.380 --> 00:32:40.940]   And they said you know most small businesses freelancers
[00:32:40.940 --> 00:32:48.460]   Don't even know if they made a profit this year let alone how much they made they just don't even know they assume
[00:32:48.460 --> 00:32:50.980]   Well, I'm paying the bills. I think I'm okay
[00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:56.060]   Fresh books without any additional effort will tell you it'll let you know
[00:32:56.060 --> 00:33:01.140]   What your accounts receivable are what you've been paid this year what you've paid out?
[00:33:01.580 --> 00:33:06.780]   In expenses this year so you you get something I would I would call it a balance sheet
[00:33:06.780 --> 00:33:09.220]   But it's much easier to read than a balance sheet by the way
[00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:11.300]   We'll do a balance sheet for your account and so forth
[00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:16.700]   It all starts with the invoices you can create professional easy invoices in less than 30 seconds
[00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:19.460]   No formatting no formulas your logos on it
[00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:25.660]   You get paid faster because there's a pay me button on every invoice and by the way your clients want to get rid of the paperwork
[00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:30.020]   Too, so they tend to pay you up to on average four days faster
[00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:35.420]   And you'll also know whether they've seen it which I really like the clients sometimes even the bad ones
[00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:40.220]   We'll say oh, I didn't get your invoice. Oh, I didn't I didn't see that well now you can say well
[00:33:40.220 --> 00:33:43.580]   No, I can see you so you open it on October 27th at 3 p.m
[00:33:43.580 --> 00:33:46.420]   Whoa, yeah, so I did
[00:33:46.420 --> 00:33:52.940]   There's a super handy deposit feature so you can invoice for a payment upfront as you kick off a project
[00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:55.780]   So you don't have to pay out of pocket. I mean I go on and on I want you to take a look

[00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:37.580]   Just write in this week in Google would you that way they they'll know you heard it on the show and we'll keep getting the ad revenue
[00:34:37.580 --> 00:34:39.260]   Which is important?
[00:34:39.260 --> 00:34:41.540]   Because all these donuts don't come cheap
[00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:48.420]   We were talking with Stacy Higginbotham from Stacy on IOT you might remember her from Iga Gagalman in fact
[00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:53.820]   If you follow her on Twitter, it's gigastacy STAC EY she's in Austin, Texas
[00:34:54.860 --> 00:35:00.500]   And from New York, New York just off time square Jeff Jarvis. He's at the City University in York
[00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:01.540]   You're doing
[00:35:01.540 --> 00:35:05.700]   What are you doing some sort of election thing at CUNY on Tuesday? Oh, yeah, I was gonna talk about that later
[00:35:05.700 --> 00:35:11.420]   But we're doing election land which is a joint venture of many folks including
[00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:15.900]   Google I believe Facebook if you just Google election land
[00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:23.820]   And I just screwed it up. It's a it's a pro-publica effort and it's love pro-publica. I love because great
[00:35:23.820 --> 00:35:28.460]   Please give me a kiss for me. We're going to be the headquarters at the CUNY
[00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:34.340]   Graduate School of Journalism newsroom for this effort which will be looking at any efforts to
[00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:37.020]   suppress voter
[00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:42.420]   Efforts around the country whatever that whatever that means means, you know bad polling or or thugs showing up or whatever
[00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:47.660]   Pro-publica Google News Lab begin YC CUNY first draft coalition which was started by Google
[00:35:47.660 --> 00:35:53.660]   Univision USA Today and others and so we'll have all the headquarters journalists here
[00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:56.220]   at CUNY in the newsroom next Tuesday and
[00:35:56.220 --> 00:36:02.460]   It'll it's all kitted out even Google's helping us bring new networks that work better
[00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:08.660]   All kinds of great stuff and we're broadcasting and then we'll get reports in well the social media desk our social media journalists
[00:36:08.660 --> 00:36:15.060]   We'll be looking at trends that are out and finding out where there's where there seems to be reports of problems
[00:36:15.060 --> 00:36:20.420]   We'll also get you know reports in we'll turn that back around to newsrooms around the country so they can report on it
[00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:24.900]   And then I'm going to be doing I think I'm gonna be doing I'm gonna try to be doing
[00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:27.700]   Facebook Live on my MIVO
[00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:30.420]   Much of the day just me blathering they want to be to do the official one
[00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:33.820]   I said no you don't want me to do that. I would be a bad idea. You've been using that a lot though
[00:36:33.820 --> 00:36:36.180]   I've been watching your dot NYC and you have a new show
[00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:43.540]   We're trying some new experiments. Yeah, it's fun to you really use in Facebook live to great advantage. We're trying it
[00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:47.580]   We're trying we're trying things. Yeah, so we're trying to be so we're gonna have two two Facebook live feeds
[00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:51.580]   One is the official one where we'll they'll be saying what's going on where we find in the trends
[00:36:51.580 --> 00:36:54.420]   and then I'll be blathering on about the election and showing off my pin and
[00:36:54.420 --> 00:37:00.620]   You know, that's what they don't want me to be official and that we'll have a up link to
[00:37:00.620 --> 00:37:07.780]   Any broadcasters we're coming in doing remotes from the newsroom and we have journalists and 60 journalism students and these
[00:37:07.780 --> 00:37:09.540]   New organizations, it's gonna be quite quite something
[00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:15.660]   So if you want to if you see any problem with your election any problem at all, I'll tell you about one myself in a second
[00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:21.540]   Just Google election land and you can go you can text election land to
[00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:25.420]   69866 you can find that on that page or click a link there to submit a report
[00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:28.860]   Now let me tell you that's a good thing to be doing
[00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:32.660]   It's a very good thing to be doing and and we'll know what's really happening and and and no
[00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:35.900]   This is not about rigging the election folks. This is about
[00:37:35.900 --> 00:37:40.420]   Press session what is pressure? Yeah, so let me tell you my little go ahead
[00:37:40.420 --> 00:37:45.820]   Well, I was gonna ask how you guys were dealing with like no phones being allowed in polling places
[00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:48.140]   or
[00:37:48.140 --> 00:37:53.420]   No phones being allowed in the voting session. I think you can I don't know but I think you can have a little places
[00:37:53.420 --> 00:37:56.180]   You know why they do that by the way, I found out this on this weekend long
[00:37:56.180 --> 00:38:03.980]   Because if you were going to buy someone's vote you would need proof that they voted and of course you can't follow them into the booth
[00:38:03.980 --> 00:38:05.580]   so
[00:38:05.580 --> 00:38:13.260]   One way to do this would be for you to snapchat or post it Instagram a picture of your ballot from the voting booth
[00:38:13.260 --> 00:38:20.160]   And so the reason they that's illegal in many states and the reason they don't want you to bring a cell phone is there is so that you can't
[00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:22.220]   use it to verify
[00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:25.340]   That you're which I understand however, I think it's
[00:38:25.340 --> 00:38:30.500]   But antiquated because of the joy of voting and showing people who were voting I think is I think is a better
[00:38:30.500 --> 00:38:34.700]   Resolve I agree. I agree. I agree and you know we did by the way
[00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:36.140]   And then I'll let you tell us your story
[00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:42.100]   But we did a great triangulation on Monday with two of the founders of verified voting org
[00:38:42.580 --> 00:38:48.460]   Which is about making elections it is about rigging. It's about the making elections fair
[00:38:48.460 --> 00:38:52.260]   Using or not using technology
[00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:55.380]   using technology appropriately in elections
[00:38:55.380 --> 00:39:01.300]   And it was really a great conversation with Ron Rivest who was a legend in crypto circles
[00:39:01.300 --> 00:39:06.780]   He's a creator of the RC cipher and RSA and his his colleague
[00:39:07.220 --> 00:39:13.860]   About you know, which which county it's by the way very hard to rig in election in the US because every county has a different system
[00:39:13.860 --> 00:39:20.860]   Which systems are used but there are some troubling still these direct electronic voting systems are still used in three states and
[00:39:20.860 --> 00:39:23.620]   These are kind of eminently hackable
[00:39:23.620 --> 00:39:31.140]   They because they don't have a paper trail and so most areas now though have a form of paper trail auditing
[00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:36.620]   And one of the things we talked about Stacy was vote star, which is a proposed system
[00:39:37.180 --> 00:39:39.900]   from your own register of voters in Austin and
[00:39:39.900 --> 00:39:45.220]   It's not yet in place. It won't be for this election, but it probably will be in a few years a
[00:39:45.220 --> 00:39:48.180]   new way of voting
[00:39:48.180 --> 00:39:54.140]   That is a tamper proof and reliable star vote. That's the name of it auditable
[00:39:54.140 --> 00:40:02.780]   Snappy because one of the things one of the criteria is you want criteria is that you want the results in a timely fashion
[00:40:03.500 --> 00:40:06.540]   It's really great anyway if you haven't listened to a triangulation
[00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:15.220]   From Monday on our election fraud issue, please do listen to that because it was really great in fact. I'm very pleased that
[00:40:15.220 --> 00:40:18.340]   one of the candidates in
[00:40:18.340 --> 00:40:21.180]   a California for
[00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:29.620]   He was running for what was he running for I think assembly or maybe secretary of state Ron Nering. He came by he's he's a
[00:40:29.620 --> 00:40:32.500]   Republican but very tech savvy
[00:40:32.660 --> 00:40:37.900]   Asked me if we were gonna cover these issues, you know safe voting electronic voting. I said yeah use it
[00:40:37.900 --> 00:40:45.540]   He's he's now passed that show around tweeted it and told people all about it because he like many of us is worried about
[00:40:45.540 --> 00:40:49.900]   This kind of using of electronic means that aren't really very you know
[00:40:49.900 --> 00:40:54.740]   It's the Internet of Things all over again. You don't want the Internet of voting machines. No bad idea
[00:40:54.740 --> 00:40:57.180]   So you had a suppression
[00:40:57.900 --> 00:41:04.780]   One thing first quickly which is that you a shout out to my friend to our friend Craig Newmark that we needed to feed these
[00:41:04.780 --> 00:41:11.380]   Hungry journalists and and I went to Craig and asked for some support for the school to do this and Craig stepped up
[00:41:11.380 --> 00:41:14.980]   So the pizza is on Craig and more lists. That's great. So yeah, so so
[00:41:14.980 --> 00:41:18.380]   Because I never know my travel schedule number was gonna be well
[00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:19.860]   I've been on an absolute balance for years
[00:41:19.860 --> 00:41:20.460]   Yeah, me too
[00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:22.060]   Yeah, and I get the absolute balance
[00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:27.580]   We have four of them in our house and the kids were home and they we all filled out our ballots and then we all
[00:41:27.580 --> 00:41:30.260]   Bailed them two of them came back to us
[00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:32.780]   Why?
[00:41:32.780 --> 00:41:36.660]   because on the back of the envelope the
[00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:43.540]   Voting Commission whatever it's called in my county puts on a sticker with the name and address of the voter and
[00:41:43.540 --> 00:41:47.020]   They barcode so that they can verify this is from voter
[00:41:47.580 --> 00:41:52.980]   Number you know, voter X and this is the only one we got from voter X and we're gonna throw away that outside envelope
[00:41:52.980 --> 00:41:55.300]   Now that we know voter X is voted so we can't vote again
[00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:58.940]   But we're gonna separate that from the inside envelope with a ballot, right? That's the system
[00:41:58.940 --> 00:42:05.500]   So they need the voters name and such on the outside and they need to have it barcoded so that they can handle it in mass
[00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:11.860]   Well, guess what the USPS bought new equipment the new equipment couldn't tell the front for the back
[00:42:11.860 --> 00:42:14.980]   It read the barcode on the back and sent it back to us
[00:42:16.860 --> 00:42:18.980]   It's really sad and imagine if you're a snowbird
[00:42:18.980 --> 00:42:22.620]   Let's say that you have an absentee ballot in your dental, Florida
[00:42:22.620 --> 00:42:27.060]   And you both voted and you don't know it but you're gonna get back
[00:42:27.060 --> 00:42:33.740]   After the winter is over back to your home in New Jersey and you're gonna find your ballot there sent back to you Wow
[00:42:33.740 --> 00:42:39.420]   That wouldn't be so good. It's a real problem. It hasn't gotten much attention. It's not
[00:42:39.420 --> 00:42:42.220]   This is one of the things as long as it's not
[00:42:43.260 --> 00:42:48.100]   Completely widespread and it's not partisan, you know, it's it's evenly distributed
[00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:53.860]   People vote by mail might be more likely to be older Republicans. I don't know exactly
[00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:55.860]   They're I think they're actually
[00:42:55.860 --> 00:42:57.860]   So male voters are
[00:42:57.860 --> 00:43:00.260]   Democratic more often really interesting
[00:43:00.260 --> 00:43:07.260]   We're democratic early. Let me see the voters by mail. So here's something kind of cool
[00:43:07.260 --> 00:43:12.620]   I've been doing this on Facebook New York Times has a bot a politics bot
[00:43:12.740 --> 00:43:18.220]   That will message you. Did you have you seen this Jeff? I actually this is the first time I liked a bot
[00:43:18.220 --> 00:43:20.860]   really, so every morning I'd get a
[00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:24.660]   Message on my Facebook messenger from the bot and then you can
[00:43:24.660 --> 00:43:26.980]   bear it
[00:43:26.980 --> 00:43:34.380]   Well, yeah, so it's so like in the bot is Nick. He's a actual person today's big news the weirdness of 2016
[00:43:34.380 --> 00:43:41.220]   And I shall FBI new emails then you can click tell me more it'll give you more you can ask it gives you some canned responses
[00:43:41.220 --> 00:43:43.220]   How so will it and then?
[00:43:43.220 --> 00:43:47.980]   After runs out you can say give me a menu or thanks and it gives you a thumbs up
[00:43:47.980 --> 00:43:51.980]   And I've actually this was one thing I kind of like they've wound it up now
[00:43:51.980 --> 00:43:56.500]   I think I got a survey asking if you we would like more of these things, but here's one
[00:43:56.500 --> 00:44:02.900]   It just came in at 9 a.m. Oh my daily forecast and then I'll ask it for the latest polls and it gives me the polls and
[00:44:02.900 --> 00:44:09.300]   And so this is oops. I have to log in never mind. That's a little bit to be a favor and go to get purple.io
[00:44:09.900 --> 00:44:15.140]   Is that another bot? It's another bot and it comes from one of our entrepreneurial students and it's quite the hotpot
[00:44:15.140 --> 00:44:17.420]   It's been talked about a lot in a lot of circles
[00:44:17.420 --> 00:44:21.140]   So I'm not a huge fan of bots, but I have to say that one was pretty good
[00:44:21.140 --> 00:44:26.300]   So this one is interactive election updates. So this is one to sign up for before election day
[00:44:26.300 --> 00:44:32.180]   Or even now yes, and and it's intended for a millennial audience sure
[00:44:32.180 --> 00:44:34.220]   but
[00:44:34.220 --> 00:44:39.820]   It's conversational, but she'll enter in as a human to occasionally and answer questions
[00:44:39.820 --> 00:44:43.900]   That aren't being answered and so on and Rebecca Harris is the name of the entrepreneur who was in our program
[00:44:43.900 --> 00:44:46.940]   And it's it's getting quite the attention here. Well, I'm signing up right now
[00:44:46.940 --> 00:44:54.060]   You obviously don't want a lot of these and I think it is kind of aimed at millennials because they
[00:44:54.060 --> 00:45:00.820]   By the way, here's a new story. Did you see Amazon has introduced a new book reading app for kids?
[00:45:00.820 --> 00:45:09.660]   No, no, this is it. It's called rapids Amazon rapids and it's book reading via messenger
[00:45:09.980 --> 00:45:13.060]   Do you have my over the shoulder shot there Carson? I don't know if you've got that
[00:45:13.060 --> 00:45:20.260]   He says he sort of does let's just find it here it is so I'll launch it and so
[00:45:20.260 --> 00:45:25.940]   Oh, it looks like a crash. So I'll reopen it short fun short stories for kids
[00:45:25.940 --> 00:45:31.580]   Let's just do a sample story here Gordon just got a strain text and then you tap
[00:45:31.580 --> 00:45:39.620]   Alien where should we land so earthlings don't see us Gordon earthlings and you tap yeah, we won't so
[00:45:39.620 --> 00:45:42.740]   This is a story book. Oh, it's cuter than I thought I was
[00:45:42.740 --> 00:45:48.620]   Yeah, I thought I thought that's using the text for that was gonna come up or in peace in the tweet. No, no
[00:45:48.620 --> 00:45:55.420]   It's kids kids and young adult books, but oh, since they're comfortable with this a by the way get some reading right and reading a sentence at a time
[00:45:55.420 --> 00:45:59.380]   It's not over modern comic book. Yeah, and it's always it's always dialogue
[00:45:59.380 --> 00:46:04.620]   Although I understand that there would be there could be other there could be pictures and videos and so forth
[00:46:04.620 --> 00:46:10.140]   But it's it's a it's whenever there's a back-and-forth dialogue. It kind of makes sense to do this I
[00:46:10.140 --> 00:46:17.780]   Don't know. I kind of this is rapids. It just came out the I this is the free sample that they give you but you can also
[00:46:17.780 --> 00:46:19.980]   buy
[00:46:19.980 --> 00:46:21.980]   these short stories
[00:46:21.980 --> 00:46:24.540]   If you're a name is on customer
[00:46:24.540 --> 00:46:30.860]   Rapids three dollars a month. Oh, that's how it works. Okay. I didn't know that so you subscribe
[00:46:32.660 --> 00:46:37.940]   That's that's super fun. Remember when the Japanese people there was that trend I think of
[00:46:37.940 --> 00:46:40.660]   Novels via Twitter like people
[00:46:40.660 --> 00:46:46.900]   Yeah, that was so we yeah, I think it'd be fun to have more storytelling options in playing around with this
[00:46:46.900 --> 00:46:51.280]   So why not kid reading kids reading nothing wrong with it in a format that they're comfortable with
[00:46:51.280 --> 00:46:56.980]   The picture showed a tablet which probably makes more sense than a little fun, but well
[00:46:56.980 --> 00:46:58.980]   I mean because there's not a lot of like
[00:46:59.220 --> 00:47:04.580]   If you look at kids books like my my daughter first saw a phone like a a landline phone in a
[00:47:04.580 --> 00:47:10.700]   Picture book like that mommy. What is that? So you think about it? It makes sense that you would have this kind of
[00:47:10.700 --> 00:47:14.100]   Bringing transit bringing all that in
[00:47:14.100 --> 00:47:19.260]   They're getting she's getting so old now. She's asking about phones and records and
[00:47:19.260 --> 00:47:22.300]   Mommy, what was it like to walk inside a bank?
[00:47:22.300 --> 00:47:27.860]   All right, you want a scary future story this we talked about this a little bit
[00:47:28.620 --> 00:47:29.980]   on the
[00:47:29.980 --> 00:47:33.460]   Twit so Google has an AI
[00:47:33.460 --> 00:47:37.640]   That it's a neural network learning network
[00:47:37.640 --> 00:47:42.300]   That has devised its own crypto algorithm
[00:47:42.300 --> 00:47:46.620]   That no one knows how it works. There are
[00:47:46.620 --> 00:47:51.100]   three parties in this Alice Bob and Eve
[00:47:51.100 --> 00:47:56.620]   Each network was given a specific goal Alice had to send a secure message to Bob
[00:47:57.460 --> 00:48:00.300]   Bob had to try and decrypt the message and
[00:48:00.300 --> 00:48:05.300]   Eve had to try an eavesdrop on the message and try to decrypt it to
[00:48:05.300 --> 00:48:07.260]   Alice and Bob
[00:48:07.260 --> 00:48:13.260]   Started with a shared secret key. They weren't told what encryption was or how to encrypt or what crypto
[00:48:13.260 --> 00:48:17.180]   techniques to use they were just given a failure condition and
[00:48:17.180 --> 00:48:19.740]   they did it and
[00:48:19.740 --> 00:48:24.220]   they came up with a crypto algorithm that solved the problem and
[00:48:26.700 --> 00:48:30.460]   Researchers don't really know how they did it
[00:48:30.460 --> 00:48:35.060]   So now they've got the bots talking to each other and we can't understand it I
[00:48:35.060 --> 00:48:40.420]   Think that says story is very scary just because of the picture they used in the head
[00:48:40.420 --> 00:48:49.400]   I think it's fascinating and I'm sure it's just you know artificial intelligence research. That's the terminator surely that is the
[00:48:49.400 --> 00:48:51.400]   Terminate I did know the terminator, okay?
[00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:56.340]   There's got to be a filter over it. The filter is extra scary. Yeah, very clever
[00:48:56.380 --> 00:49:01.820]   That's Sebastian Anthony writing in the Ars Technica UK. So I think that's interesting that you
[00:49:01.820 --> 00:49:09.620]   Artificial intelligence used to create crypto algorithms that even its creators don't know how it works
[00:49:09.620 --> 00:49:14.580]   This this sounds scary and it may feel scary, but we've got to remember
[00:49:14.580 --> 00:49:20.460]   Computers are not people and when we start thinking about AI we always anthropomorphize right and
[00:49:20.460 --> 00:49:22.820]   We assume the worst
[00:49:22.820 --> 00:49:28.780]   Well, we assume the worst, but we also like why would we expect to understand computers talking to each other?
[00:49:28.780 --> 00:49:34.620]   I don't understand my modem, which is computers talking to each other. Oh great point some people do
[00:49:34.620 --> 00:49:40.620]   I just want to point out what okay you may not but that's ones and zeros Sheldon does I understand what it's doing
[00:49:40.620 --> 00:49:45.100]   It's demodulating a modulating ones and zeros and it can be you couldn't speak its length
[00:49:45.100 --> 00:49:50.380]   But we couldn't speak it. That's what I'm getting like we understand like I understand what it means
[00:49:50.380 --> 00:49:53.780]   I could create a device that would I would understand you would okay?
[00:49:53.780 --> 00:50:00.100]   And so the point here that we should focus on is that we can't create a device or create a translation engine for it. Yeah
[00:50:00.100 --> 00:50:03.060]   Okay, so we have no idea what it did
[00:50:03.060 --> 00:50:06.220]   And maybe I you know who knows maybe they do
[00:50:06.220 --> 00:50:12.500]   We had Jerry Kaplan speaking up going to give another plug to triangulation the week before Jerry Kaplan you may remember from go
[00:50:12.500 --> 00:50:16.780]   He's been a serial entrepreneur created on sale a lot of the great stuff has a good book on
[00:50:17.340 --> 00:50:22.860]   Artificial intelligence and unlike many of the people we've talked about AI with he says yeah exactly what you say Stacy
[00:50:22.860 --> 00:50:28.900]   Why do we assume that it's going to be we're anthropomorphizing it? These are just dumb machines
[00:50:28.900 --> 00:50:33.980]   It's not as smart as they get they're never going to be more than servants. It's not a problem
[00:50:33.980 --> 00:50:37.900]   He doesn't believe in the singularity in other words
[00:50:37.900 --> 00:50:40.100]   Oh man
[00:50:40.100 --> 00:50:46.420]   Masa I can't think of his first name is a masa the chairman of soft bank gave us a present
[00:50:46.420 --> 00:50:48.780]   Masa your son. Yeah, Masa. Yes, she said
[00:50:48.780 --> 00:50:56.900]   He gave this whole presentation at arm tech on all about the singularity coming and they're being a trillion connected devices and
[00:50:56.900 --> 00:51:00.720]   Wow, I was kind of like it's easy to say
[00:51:00.720 --> 00:51:03.420]   It's hard to do
[00:51:03.420 --> 00:51:10.580]   Yeah, I mean just connecting you know a hundred devices in my home. There's I'm not closer to the singularity at all
[00:51:10.580 --> 00:51:15.460]   Technologies knows we're not even there's been so long ago
[00:51:15.940 --> 00:51:21.220]   Google Pixel I've been playing with it and I told Jeff last week not to buy one. Maybe I shouldn't say that
[00:51:21.220 --> 00:51:22.220]   I don't know oh
[00:51:22.220 --> 00:51:24.820]   I go again. So I hi still home and I haven't opened it. Oh
[00:51:24.820 --> 00:51:27.700]   I just don't know
[00:51:27.700 --> 00:51:32.420]   You're lucky you've got one Google apparently is missing the ship date for a lot of people
[00:51:32.420 --> 00:51:36.780]   And they're sending $50 plate credits to pixel buyers with missed delivery winners
[00:51:36.780 --> 00:51:41.220]   I ordered a the small one the pixel five inch pixel
[00:51:41.580 --> 00:51:45.300]   with 128 gigs in extra black or whatever they call it and
[00:51:45.300 --> 00:51:53.740]   They just debited my credit card and it's now moved from what is it processing to and you know
[00:51:53.740 --> 00:51:57.700]   They have these code words. It's I think that's where my Google home is yeah mine too
[00:51:57.700 --> 00:52:00.260]   Supposed to come next week right after the election
[00:52:00.260 --> 00:52:08.460]   Signing I'll be in California. I won't even get to open it. I installed a plug socket just for the Google
[00:52:09.580 --> 00:52:13.980]   No, yeah, I know where are you putting it? It's gonna be my closet
[00:52:13.980 --> 00:52:17.260]   Wait what what?
[00:52:17.260 --> 00:52:22.860]   Why do you want it in your closet? The only room in the house that doesn't have an Amazon Echo you're gonna just have to move one of the
[00:52:22.860 --> 00:52:24.860]   Echoes come on no
[00:52:24.860 --> 00:52:28.060]   No, I spent a lot of time in the closet
[00:52:28.060 --> 00:52:35.860]   Okay, go ahead you could talk about it. It's all right. Yeah, you're among friends my mine is actually going
[00:52:35.860 --> 00:52:41.260]   I'm putting mine in the bathroom. So it's no it's a little stranger our closet is off the bathroom
[00:52:41.260 --> 00:52:45.020]   So it's kind of closet bathroom. So I don't have a oh
[00:52:45.020 --> 00:52:47.780]   Yes, oh
[00:52:47.780 --> 00:52:52.140]   I think you're gonna say you don't have a lot of square footage. I just thought he's gonna say I don't have a bathroom
[00:52:52.140 --> 00:52:54.140]   That's what's really confusing
[00:52:54.140 --> 00:52:55.740]   No
[00:52:55.740 --> 00:52:59.580]   Because I think that I will use the Google home in the morning
[00:52:59.580 --> 00:53:03.540]   Right as I'm dressing as I'm getting ready for work that kind of thing
[00:53:03.540 --> 00:53:07.660]   So it will be somewhere where I can talk to it from during my morning evolutions
[00:53:07.660 --> 00:53:16.620]   And it's because I think that's how I use it although it has apparently good speakers that that are better than the echoes speakers
[00:53:16.620 --> 00:53:22.060]   So you can play music while you're in the shower. That's we actually have a sonos speakers installed in our bathroom for that very reason
[00:53:22.060 --> 00:53:24.060]   I have a sonos play five in my bathroom
[00:53:24.060 --> 00:53:31.740]   Hey, have you yet received the update so that you can use your Amazon echo to get your sonos doing stuff
[00:53:32.260 --> 00:53:35.540]   No, but even if I have I I haven't been home
[00:53:35.540 --> 00:53:43.660]   Apparently not I know so I'm like I have a box full of gadgets. I've got two two new routers
[00:53:43.660 --> 00:53:46.260]   Some other stuff
[00:53:46.260 --> 00:53:48.660]   Somebody said I should rename it the Google throne
[00:53:48.660 --> 00:53:58.340]   The air freshener add on it does look a little like a real air freshener. I have to admit
[00:53:59.100 --> 00:54:04.340]   Google says adoption of the pixel is surpassing the Nexus 6p or did in its first week
[00:54:04.340 --> 00:54:06.500]   But the problem is they can't make them fast enough
[00:54:06.500 --> 00:54:13.500]   Actually, this is from app boy, which actually has pretty good data Google's not saying but app boy looks at
[00:54:13.500 --> 00:54:19.880]   Which devices are downloading apps and so forth pixel has reached point zero one six percent of market share
[00:54:19.880 --> 00:54:23.820]   pixel XL point zero two percent of market share in
[00:54:23.820 --> 00:54:27.980]   One week took the six P two weeks to get to a similar level
[00:54:28.980 --> 00:54:32.140]   Google all right, but still is you know not in the
[00:54:32.140 --> 00:54:35.620]   Phone stores, which I think is gonna hurt it only Verizon has the
[00:54:35.620 --> 00:54:41.220]   Pixel yeah, but Timo has this deal where if you bring your your pixel into them
[00:54:41.220 --> 00:54:47.100]   They give you like half off. Yeah, but it's only on the 32 gig model, which baffles me. That's weird
[00:54:47.100 --> 00:54:50.220]   I don't know that you'll use more data exactly
[00:54:50.220 --> 00:54:54.860]   Bingo, you can't store anything on this device. So you gotta use data
[00:54:55.580 --> 00:54:57.940]   Alright Leo, so I've got to make the decision finally
[00:54:57.940 --> 00:55:03.100]   Well, you saw the the the one picture that convinced
[00:55:03.100 --> 00:55:09.420]   One tech editor. Yeah, the pixel was the right phone
[00:55:09.420 --> 00:55:15.020]   I love better than the better than the iPhone. I took a photo with the pixel says
[00:55:15.020 --> 00:55:22.660]   Vlads of all of the verge that changed my mind about the iPhone, but you know, I think this is extremely
[00:55:24.020 --> 00:55:30.380]   Not useful because I think you could take any camera phone even kind of a crappy one and in exactly the right
[00:55:30.380 --> 00:55:34.300]   Circumstances get a great picture. This is just down the street from you
[00:55:34.300 --> 00:55:40.780]   Rainy night in New York is always a beautiful. Yeah, but it's you know, it's dark
[00:55:40.780 --> 00:55:46.380]   Sometimes some people said the iPhone over does the grain and dark. I don't know
[00:55:46.380 --> 00:55:49.180]   so and
[00:55:50.660 --> 00:55:55.300]   It is it is truly an excellent camera. I will I will grant you that
[00:55:55.300 --> 00:55:56.820]   I
[00:55:56.820 --> 00:56:02.580]   Like the form factor. I think it doesn't bother me. It's not waterproof. Although that bothers some people
[00:56:02.580 --> 00:56:10.460]   If you're gonna use an Android phone, I think this is the best Android phone so but you already have a 6p
[00:56:10.460 --> 00:56:13.540]   Which is the next best mm-hmm. You're not helping Leo. I know
[00:56:13.540 --> 00:56:17.020]   I want you to I'm not upgrading you're not
[00:56:17.020 --> 00:56:19.540]   No, you're gonna stay with the 6p
[00:56:20.020 --> 00:56:25.820]   I know I've got the 5x which is even worse phone. I know and I'm still not upgrading. Why not? Oh
[00:56:25.820 --> 00:56:34.140]   It's very expensive. It's it's expensive. I've got to buy an iPhone to work my gadget magic
[00:56:34.140 --> 00:56:39.780]   So isn't that interesting so a lot of the stuff that you playing with can't be done on Android?
[00:56:39.780 --> 00:56:46.260]   That's almost always the case like wow one's Apple bought test flight, you know, all Android users were screwed
[00:56:46.260 --> 00:56:48.900]   Wow
[00:56:48.900 --> 00:56:54.300]   Test flight is not nearly as good as such solution for developers as Android is test flight allows you to
[00:56:54.300 --> 00:57:00.260]   Give beta versions of your program to users with that, you know bypassing the app store
[00:57:00.260 --> 00:57:05.200]   But it was so easy to do an APK on Android that you know
[00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:06.960]   Yes, you need test flights on Android
[00:57:06.960 --> 00:57:11.540]   But if you've got if you've got a shortage of time and energy you're gonna develop for the iPhone first
[00:57:11.540 --> 00:57:16.740]   I guess you're right. Still if for especially for these products, they're expensive early adopter products
[00:57:17.460 --> 00:57:22.240]   Yeah, and iPhone people are early adopters who buy expensive products. I
[00:57:22.240 --> 00:57:29.820]   Wouldn't say they're early adopters. I mean, I guess you're right. I feel like I feel like Android people are probably more early adopters on most things
[00:57:29.820 --> 00:57:32.700]   But someone's got an iPhone in the house. Yeah
[00:57:32.700 --> 00:57:37.780]   And it's easier. You don't have to have like 50 apps you have your iPhone app
[00:57:37.780 --> 00:57:43.300]   You know what would really put me I think over the top on the pixel and make it my daily driver
[00:57:43.300 --> 00:57:45.820]   Okay
[00:57:45.820 --> 00:57:50.540]   Is if they would just freakin get your messaging story straight. I
[00:57:50.540 --> 00:57:56.360]   Don't know what to use for messaging. They want me to use Google's messages, which is terrible
[00:57:56.360 --> 00:58:01.940]   I like hangouts, but if aloe would just become the why is aloe not yet the default?
[00:58:01.940 --> 00:58:06.420]   Messaging app on the picture. Now. There's a new version is it is a two point. I haven't
[00:58:06.420 --> 00:58:13.340]   Who's using that I couldn't find Kevin Tofol the other day for the podcast. I had to find it
[00:58:13.340 --> 00:58:18.860]   So we do Skype. So I'm like paying him on Skype that I'm like well. I found him on aloe
[00:58:18.860 --> 00:58:24.540]   And then I'm like peeing on hangouts. It was just ridiculous. I'm sending this message to Kevin
[00:58:24.540 --> 00:58:31.220]   Like six different times we just have time so because you don't know which messaging client he uses
[00:58:31.220 --> 00:58:38.700]   Yeah, Facebook messenger. I bet Facebook messenger would be my but I don't really want to use Facebook for all my SMS's either
[00:58:38.700 --> 00:58:42.780]   Oh, I didn't even think about Facebook. Yeah, you know what?
[00:58:42.940 --> 00:58:49.420]   Facebook by the way is the lingua franca for most of most of us if you can you can always reach through Facebook
[00:58:49.420 --> 00:58:54.640]   Almost always you can never reach me through Facebook. I know because you don't use it. You're the one person
[00:58:54.640 --> 00:58:59.580]   I know Facebook announced by the way, they're earnings right before the show and
[00:58:59.580 --> 00:59:03.700]   They beat the street in almost every respect 1.6
[00:59:03.700 --> 00:59:07.460]   7 billion monthly active users I
[00:59:07.460 --> 00:59:10.700]   Thought you were gonna tell me how much money they made oh
[00:59:12.220 --> 00:59:14.740]   Lot more than one not more than yeah
[00:59:14.740 --> 00:59:17.860]   Let's see here. Let me give you the
[00:59:17.860 --> 00:59:20.700]   the actual statistics
[00:59:20.700 --> 00:59:24.580]   From investor dot. I know that's that's the old one
[00:59:24.580 --> 00:59:32.860]   Let me get the new ones. That's Joe 1 billion active on WhatsApp 1 billion active on messenger 500 million active on Instagram. She's
[00:59:32.860 --> 00:59:35.500]   7.1
[00:59:35.500 --> 00:59:41.220]   7.01 billion in revenue 59% increase in revenue year over there
[00:59:41.660 --> 00:59:48.020]   59% in advertising revenue so clearly they figured out the advertising revenue right well
[00:59:48.020 --> 00:59:50.540]   But didn't they have that it wasn't a huge deal?
[00:59:50.540 --> 00:59:55.700]   But didn't they miscount a bunch of stuff a couple months ago and they had to come fresh so this is that quarter ah
[00:59:55.700 --> 00:59:58.620]   56% increase in revenue
[00:59:58.620 --> 01:00:01.660]   28% increase in costs
[01:00:01.660 --> 01:00:05.180]   Net income up
[01:00:05.180 --> 01:00:10.900]   166% to 2.3 billion dollars for three months
[01:00:11.900 --> 01:00:16.100]   160% profit on revenue growth of how much?
[01:00:16.100 --> 01:00:25.300]   160 revenue growth is a hundred is this 59% 56% so they're getting more profitable. Yes nice
[01:00:25.300 --> 01:00:31.020]   Earnings per share 82% that's up 165% this was a massive a
[01:00:31.020 --> 01:00:37.900]   massive quarter daily active users 1.18 billion at daily daily
[01:00:38.900 --> 01:00:41.900]   monthly active users 1.79 billion
[01:00:41.900 --> 01:00:50.260]   Mobile oh get this mobile daily so I said the daily active users were 1.18 billion
[01:00:50.260 --> 01:00:53.300]   Mobile daily 1.09 billion
[01:00:53.300 --> 01:00:56.020]   Jesus almost all
[01:00:56.020 --> 01:00:58.060]   Welsh meb web schmeb
[01:00:58.060 --> 01:01:00.780]   You said it here last
[01:01:00.780 --> 01:01:03.100]   also monthly active users
[01:01:03.100 --> 01:01:07.180]   1.79 of which 1.66 billion were mobile
[01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:13.140]   Incredible increase on mobile of 20 to 20 20% year over year
[01:01:13.140 --> 01:01:16.220]   mobile advertising revenue
[01:01:16.220 --> 01:01:18.820]   84% for the third quarter
[01:01:18.820 --> 01:01:24.180]   Up from 78% so they've licked mobile. They know it. They've got it. They own it
[01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:28.900]   Mark Zuckerberg said we had another good quarter
[01:01:28.900 --> 01:01:35.700]   Good quarter
[01:01:35.700 --> 01:01:41.540]   We are making progress putting video first across our apps and executing our 10 year technology
[01:01:41.540 --> 01:01:49.340]   Road map so we were talking about the election and now I have one more thing to watch which is your election HQ
[01:01:49.340 --> 01:01:53.220]   But this is gonna be an interesting
[01:01:53.220 --> 01:01:59.660]   It is every four years right it gets more and more interesting. Where are you gonna watch election results? I?
[01:01:59.660 --> 01:02:04.100]   Bet you're gonna watch on Twitter Stacy probably Twitter
[01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:09.860]   You know, am I I'm gonna be out of town so I'll probably you were home because that's not a fair test
[01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:14.260]   Well, would you have a TV on an orbit on a news channel? I?
[01:02:14.260 --> 01:02:20.380]   Actually like going to bars and watching it with people believe it or not. It's like a sock dangerous
[01:02:20.380 --> 01:02:27.260]   Yeah, it could be really dangerous. I nosta please Austin's a tough. I mean Texas is a toss up
[01:02:27.260 --> 01:02:29.060]   But Austin and we know where Austin's going
[01:02:31.780 --> 01:02:36.100]   Let's see I think for me news channel on the TV
[01:02:36.100 --> 01:02:38.700]   tweet deck running with
[01:02:38.700 --> 01:02:43.860]   With the main feed but a few extra accounts in the columns
[01:02:43.860 --> 01:02:51.740]   I guess you could watch Twitter now right because Twitter is gonna have where they gonna have is BuzzFeed
[01:02:51.740 --> 01:02:58.500]   Live stream. Yeah, so you can watch Twitter on BuzzFeed. I like I have the New York Times open to just for oh, yeah
[01:02:58.940 --> 01:03:01.340]   Just for credibility sake. So what?
[01:03:01.340 --> 01:03:07.060]   What will BuzzFeed look like? What will BuzzFeed election coverage be like? It's millennial aimed, right?
[01:03:07.060 --> 01:03:14.500]   Bunch of short videos about yeah the cats of the candidates. No, I mean the news
[01:03:14.500 --> 01:03:17.100]   Thing
[01:03:17.100 --> 01:03:23.620]   Right and they have very very good people there. They do they have wonderful journalism actually which is so weird for me
[01:03:23.620 --> 01:03:25.460]   I don't get it it is
[01:03:25.460 --> 01:03:30.660]   You know, I just read somebody posted on Twitter probably a link to a a
[01:03:30.660 --> 01:03:34.500]   a
[01:03:34.500 --> 01:03:42.180]   Gawker article was a Gawker one of one of the one of those I think was Gawker article about all the new media and who and
[01:03:42.180 --> 01:03:47.940]   The question was who's gonna be around in a year? Yeah, and all of them survived Gawker did not
[01:03:52.620 --> 01:03:55.580]   By the way that settlement has now been happened
[01:03:55.580 --> 01:04:00.580]   Gawker settled with Hulk Hogan 31 million down from 110
[01:04:00.580 --> 01:04:03.060]   final settlement
[01:04:03.060 --> 01:04:05.060]   It's over
[01:04:05.060 --> 01:04:07.860]   Nobody cares
[01:04:07.860 --> 01:04:12.860]   Aloe 2.0 update brings app shortcuts a gift keyboard and
[01:04:12.860 --> 01:04:18.080]   Other new features. I haven't seen it yet, but I guess it's coming out
[01:04:19.900 --> 01:04:23.580]   See what version I have wait a gift keyboard. Yeah
[01:04:23.580 --> 01:04:26.660]   Oh, and finally
[01:04:26.660 --> 01:04:32.580]   Let's see. Let me I guess you can tell if you have the aloe if you long press it. Yeah, I have new conversation
[01:04:32.580 --> 01:04:37.900]   So you long press you get a new conversation. I'm not gonna show it because I have
[01:04:37.900 --> 01:04:41.180]   phone numbers and stuff in there
[01:04:41.180 --> 01:04:46.380]   I feel like I just anyway to get back to what started this all I want Aloe to do a better job of
[01:04:47.380 --> 01:04:49.660]   Google do better job. It's messaging strategy
[01:04:49.660 --> 01:04:53.940]   Just feel like but how does that you said that would make the difference with the phone?
[01:04:53.940 --> 01:05:01.360]   That's just that's an uber an uber and radish or not. I guess it is it's true. Oh, I have I have version 2.0. Oh, oh, you do
[01:05:01.360 --> 01:05:08.140]   Jeff you're so fancy. I am portante fancy person. I still know so what do I get here?
[01:05:08.140 --> 01:05:15.060]   So I can talk to Leo or talk to Leo. Oh, yeah, the only person I've ever allied with is Jeff
[01:05:15.820 --> 01:05:20.780]   So there it is. I'm gonna send Leo some pants. You can send me pants
[01:05:20.780 --> 01:05:27.060]   Gosh, I will send you a hat to go with them because you like your hats. No, it's another now
[01:05:27.060 --> 01:05:30.900]   What's funny is I guess I have aloe on my apple phone. So you're sending it to the apple phone
[01:05:30.900 --> 01:05:36.700]   Really well, and that's one thing I don't like about aloe is it's phone number specific

[01:09:55.100 --> 01:09:57.100]   Inspector of Petronum
[01:09:57.100 --> 01:10:02.500]   The geekiest moment. I knew a Vada cadaver though. I gotta say okay. This isn't geeky at all
[01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:07.540]   It won't kill anybody your phone will not kill anybody for you. Oh
[01:10:07.540 --> 01:10:11.620]   If it's a Samsung am I sorry? Do you think they're getting paid?
[01:10:11.620 --> 01:10:15.180]   I bet you they are because there's a new Harry Potter movie coming out, right?
[01:10:15.180 --> 01:10:16.020]   That was okay
[01:10:16.020 --> 01:10:22.780]   So that's actually what I wanted after I got excited. I was gonna say look this is a whole new merchandising tactic and how interesting is that?
[01:10:22.900 --> 01:10:26.140]   Remember you could explore Bruce Wayne's manner on
[01:10:26.140 --> 01:10:31.620]   Maps now you'll be able to take a trip down memory lane and visit fantastic beasts
[01:10:31.620 --> 01:10:36.700]   1926 New York on Google Maps
[01:10:36.700 --> 01:10:40.700]   You can also visit the magical Congress of the USA
[01:10:40.700 --> 01:10:47.100]   Steen National Bank the underground speakeasy the blind pig the magical apartment of Tina and Queenie Goldstein
[01:10:47.100 --> 01:10:51.060]   This is all from the all from the movie. This is a Google blog post
[01:10:52.580 --> 01:10:57.260]   Cast a spell with so this is a Warner Brothers promotion. That's smart
[01:10:57.260 --> 01:11:01.020]   Yeah, I like I hope they don't take out loo most that's good. I
[01:11:01.020 --> 01:11:05.700]   Have long wanted like once I brought back my wand from Harry Potter world
[01:11:05.700 --> 01:11:10.100]   I really wanted it to work with all the commands like to be able to raise my shades and stuff
[01:11:10.100 --> 01:11:13.180]   I know it's really a cheat because when you're in the store
[01:11:13.180 --> 01:11:18.500]   It does stuff then you leave and it doesn't do crap, right?
[01:11:19.580 --> 01:11:23.900]   How much was the one because I ended up not buying one because I knew I was gonna be disappointed there
[01:11:23.900 --> 01:11:26.920]   What I think it was forty dollars. Oh my god for a stick of wood
[01:11:26.920 --> 01:11:30.820]   They're pretty though you I mean some of them are very nice
[01:11:30.820 --> 01:11:37.500]   They're late and each one has different just like the real Harry Potter ones magical beasts hairs and feathers and
[01:11:37.500 --> 01:11:41.620]   What did you get what did you get? Oh Lord?
[01:11:41.620 --> 01:11:44.620]   I could show it to you
[01:11:44.620 --> 01:11:47.620]   Just remember this
[01:11:47.780 --> 01:11:52.180]   The wizard doesn't choose the wand the wand chooses the wizard Stacy
[01:11:52.180 --> 01:11:56.460]   So my daughter they do this whole ceremony. Yeah, she was she got picked
[01:11:56.460 --> 01:12:02.260]   She got picked so she's in there and then they gave her her wand at the end and she was like
[01:12:02.260 --> 01:12:05.700]   Yeah, I don't actually want this one and she went for her
[01:12:05.700 --> 01:12:10.660]   But was that one free? I always wondered that no it is not free still have to pay for it
[01:12:10.660 --> 01:12:16.140]   Even if you were you were part of the demo you should get that for free. I should have argued that what was I thinking?
[01:12:16.140 --> 01:12:22.820]   Yeah, come on too much better beer. You know what? Yeah that butter beer man that stuff will put you in a diabetic coma. Holy cow
[01:12:22.820 --> 01:12:26.180]   Wasn't make don't make you drunk, but I'll make you woozy
[01:12:26.180 --> 01:12:30.380]   Your heart rates go in
[01:12:30.380 --> 01:12:39.380]   All right, I don't know we lost our way here somewhere Jeff's not even helping that he's playing with his expecto
[01:12:39.380 --> 01:12:45.260]   Yeah, I can tell that all right we could talk about tango and daydream
[01:12:45.780 --> 01:12:51.900]   Both emerging for the first time into the wild but first a word from our favorite
[01:12:51.900 --> 01:12:59.540]   Registrar of all time hover commas. So glad to welcome back. We use hover like crazy whether they were a sponsor or not
[01:12:59.540 --> 01:13:04.780]   I'm all in on hover in fact Steve Gibson who was looking to move his domains and
[01:13:04.780 --> 01:13:11.740]   He asked on Twitter. What should I get and the consensus was hover and he's very happy you will be happy to
[01:13:12.940 --> 01:13:15.900]   100 domain extensions of course calm
[01:13:15.900 --> 01:13:20.780]   net but all sorts of fun niche extensions like
[01:13:20.780 --> 01:13:23.180]   Dot design
[01:13:23.180 --> 01:13:29.580]   Dot tech I have I've registered a ton of domains at hover for all sorts of silly purposes
[01:13:29.580 --> 01:13:37.140]   Partly because it's it's so easy to do. I am a huge fan of hover comm. I have let's see
[01:13:37.140 --> 01:13:41.260]   I registered you might like this Stacy in fact. I'll give it to you if you want giggle home
[01:13:42.540 --> 01:13:44.540]   No, no
[01:13:44.540 --> 01:13:47.060]   No, you don't want giggle home
[01:13:47.060 --> 01:13:49.780]   No, you could
[01:13:49.780 --> 01:13:54.180]   No, really no. Thank you. No, I'm sorry. You don't want giggle home
[01:13:54.180 --> 01:14:00.580]   All right, it makes me think of like small children and then oh and it goes goes together doesn't it?
[01:14:00.580 --> 01:14:03.400]   I've got a I've got like a baby body with ohms head on it
[01:14:03.400 --> 01:14:10.700]   Exactly. So that was what the plan was was to make a website with oh, I'm just giggling like a bobblehead
[01:14:10.700 --> 01:14:12.700]   I
[01:14:12.700 --> 01:14:18.260]   Picture own giggling. I've known that man for eight years. He seems like he would giggle. He's not I would say
[01:14:18.260 --> 01:14:21.220]   He's not a gigger. Yeah, God. I would think he's a gigger
[01:14:21.220 --> 01:14:28.660]   Okay, I have twit dot agency twit dot careers twit dot company twit dot equipment twit dot expert
[01:14:28.660 --> 01:14:34.340]   Twit dot TV of course twit dot watch twit live dot com twit live dot TV twit questions dot com
[01:14:34.340 --> 01:14:39.740]   I it's so easy to register a domain name and it's so affordable at hover and what's great about hover
[01:14:40.220 --> 01:14:43.020]   You don't have to if you've ever used some of those other guys
[01:14:43.020 --> 01:14:49.100]   You you think you've registered the domain and then there's page after page of checkboxes. You want this do you want that you want this
[01:14:49.100 --> 01:14:51.540]   Do you want that never with hover for instance?
[01:14:51.540 --> 01:14:53.860]   You know you want who is privacy, right?
[01:14:53.860 --> 01:14:58.340]   So people can't look up your phone number on on the net because who is is a public database?
[01:14:58.340 --> 01:15:02.460]   Hover gives that to you free and automatically is part of your domain registration
[01:15:02.460 --> 01:15:07.860]   Hover doesn't do a lot of extra stuff. They only offer domains and email
[01:15:07.860 --> 01:15:11.260]   So you focus and get in the domain name you want and then get back to work
[01:15:11.260 --> 01:15:16.900]   Unlike most other domain providers they do include who is privacy with all supported domain
[01:15:16.900 --> 01:15:23.300]   So your information is confidential and if you already have a bunch of domains as I did scattered over a bunch of different providers
[01:15:23.300 --> 01:15:30.740]   Save money by bringing them all to hover with volume discounts the more domains in your account the more of a discount you get automatically
[01:15:30.740 --> 01:15:35.300]   No more digging through help articles to find out how to get your domain where you ain't working either
[01:15:35.300 --> 01:15:38.820]   And if you ever have a problem hovers famous
[01:15:38.820 --> 01:15:40.940]   No, hold
[01:15:40.940 --> 01:15:42.060]   humans
[01:15:42.060 --> 01:15:44.060]   Online tech support. It's awesome
[01:15:44.060 --> 01:15:51.500]   They will help you and they will not put you on hold and they will not hang up till your job is done till they've solved
[01:15:51.500 --> 01:15:54.620]   But look if look at all the website builders portfolio
[01:15:54.620 --> 01:16:02.500]   tools personal home pages that support hover everything from weebly and WordPress to tumblr to Facebook Google+
[01:16:03.380 --> 01:16:08.460]   Flickr Twitter it makes it very easy for you to do the integration you want
[01:16:08.460 --> 01:16:11.460]   hover.com
[01:16:11.460 --> 01:16:13.100]   I am a big fan
[01:16:13.100 --> 01:16:20.980]   It's who I use to register my domain names and I highly recommend it to Steve uses and now you get 10% off your first purchase
[01:16:20.980 --> 01:16:28.140]   If you go to hover h o v e r.com and use a promo code twig hover.com promo code twig to get 10% off
[01:16:28.780 --> 01:16:36.060]   Your brand new domain names. I have I just looked 54 domain names at hover. I use them for my email -
[01:16:36.060 --> 01:16:41.640]   Which is really nice. I mean the email gets forwarded to Gmail. This is by the way a really great tip
[01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:45.220]   And I don't know why everybody doesn't do this if it you know
[01:16:45.220 --> 01:16:49.660]   You may move email providers from time to time if you use your ISP now you want to use Google
[01:16:49.660 --> 01:16:53.500]   Maybe you were on Yahoo mail and you want to get off you don't want to tell everybody
[01:16:53.500 --> 01:16:55.500]   Oh, I got a new email and constantly do that
[01:16:55.500 --> 01:16:57.620]   simple
[01:16:57.620 --> 01:16:59.620]   simple go to hover.com and
[01:16:59.620 --> 01:17:03.460]   Get a domain name like your family name. I have Leo Le Porte.com
[01:17:03.460 --> 01:17:11.500]   And then that's gonna be your email address and then you have you work with hover and they will forward any number of addresses to
[01:17:11.500 --> 01:17:15.020]   Wherever you want I have it forwarded to to Gmail. It couldn't be easier
[01:17:15.020 --> 01:17:18.760]   Very good use for domain name. It doesn't have to just be for a web page
[01:17:18.760 --> 01:17:23.300]   hover.com use the Africa twig and save 10%
[01:17:26.020 --> 01:17:30.600]   Apparently there is an animation. Oh, that's right. Bleak. You did that for us. I
[01:17:30.600 --> 01:17:33.460]   I just clicked on it. Is it good?
[01:17:33.460 --> 01:17:40.620]   It's nice. Yeah, I would say that's not a giggle. It's not a giggle. I don't know if that's a that's a
[01:17:40.620 --> 01:17:43.180]   Jolly jolly jolly laugh
[01:17:43.180 --> 01:17:50.580]   Isn't he a sweetheart? He is he is just the best out of his howling. He's really enjoyed that one whatever it was
[01:17:50.580 --> 01:17:53.260]   whatever somebody said that was
[01:17:54.780 --> 01:17:57.380]   I'm putting that on gig on Giggle home right now
[01:17:57.380 --> 01:18:02.780]   That's true. We could just find all the pictures. I've got to have video of home laughing. Yeah
[01:18:02.780 --> 01:18:05.740]   See now you like Giggle home
[01:18:05.740 --> 01:18:13.900]   What what what motivates you to do that? What was the moment when you decided I'm sure it was on the air and
[01:18:13.900 --> 01:18:16.460]   Somebody said something and I said quick to hover
[01:18:16.460 --> 01:18:22.820]   I'm sure that's the reason you are. Did I ever tell you the story of Buzz machine? No
[01:18:24.020 --> 01:18:30.980]   So I was talking with Nick Denton on chat of all people of all people quite quite a number of years ago
[01:18:30.980 --> 01:18:33.820]   Just as he was starting gocker and I was trying to
[01:18:33.820 --> 01:18:40.860]   Explain what a company that I was on the board of that has since gone gone away. It was plastic the company that owned
[01:18:40.860 --> 01:18:45.100]   What was the shoot fish in the barrel site?
[01:18:45.100 --> 01:18:50.240]   Joey enough all that stuff. Are you talking about ancient ancient internet history?
[01:18:51.500 --> 01:18:55.820]   So anyway, so I was trying to know what the company did it was really trying to be early chat
[01:18:55.820 --> 01:18:58.780]   I said, you know Nick. I said it's a Buzz machine and
[01:18:58.780 --> 01:19:04.580]   Nick comes back and says that's a great domain. I'm taking it. Oh, and I said no the hell way you are
[01:19:04.580 --> 01:19:08.980]   So I rush. Oh, you had a race price. Yes. I raced I raced to a higher price
[01:19:08.980 --> 01:19:13.020]   Domain he was still trying to come up with a name for gocker. I think actually
[01:19:13.020 --> 01:19:18.860]   Yeah, he was he was still debating the name of gocker and so I rushed and got it for myself and said f you Nick and
[01:19:20.580 --> 01:19:22.580]   So then I owned it and then it's a boy
[01:19:22.580 --> 01:19:26.260]   So well, you know, you want it for for gocker and no it was below
[01:19:26.260 --> 01:19:30.260]   Good enough for wouldn't cool enough for him and so then when I started the blog
[01:19:30.260 --> 01:19:36.900]   Originally it was call I call I was on blogger and I called it World War three because it was after 9/11
[01:19:36.900 --> 01:19:42.940]   Decided that wouldn't last for a long and shouldn't so I needed a name for a blog so I look oh, I own Buzz machine
[01:19:42.940 --> 01:19:48.540]   That's how that's how I got it. It was a twit from August 14th 2011
[01:19:50.220 --> 01:19:52.460]   Episode 314 I'm told by the chatroom oh
[01:19:52.460 --> 01:20:01.660]   Oh, no wonder he doesn't come on the show anymore too much humiliation
[01:20:01.660 --> 01:20:05.140]   The Yoda of tech
[01:20:05.140 --> 01:20:12.060]   Except I'm backwards. He really is though isn't he like the grand wise man of tech. I have watched people
[01:20:12.060 --> 01:20:15.700]   I watch people like the entire GSM a GSM a yeah
[01:20:15.780 --> 01:20:22.660]   They came in and they literally sat in a circle around oh and he just talked to them and told them and the best part
[01:20:22.660 --> 01:20:25.220]   Was being oh, but he's like you guys are doing everything all wrong
[01:20:25.220 --> 01:20:32.100]   And they listened and they listened yes, yeah, I was like love it love it love it love it
[01:20:32.100 --> 01:20:37.300]   If this then that integration from Google assistant, that's you know, I oh
[01:20:37.300 --> 01:20:44.180]   You didn't know about this no, I did I thought you're gonna talk about the new if but oh, let's talk about the new if
[01:20:44.820 --> 01:20:46.820]   So I mean that well, that's the story
[01:20:46.820 --> 01:20:51.740]   If you have a pixel or soon a Google home you can use if this than that
[01:20:51.740 --> 01:20:57.140]   They the examples they give our okay Google party time
[01:20:57.140 --> 01:21:01.140]   Which I guess gives you a few lights of party cast
[01:21:01.140 --> 01:21:08.700]   You could post to Facebook by voice see that's what I can do from I think that's actually really on my Google throne
[01:21:12.060 --> 01:21:18.380]   Block the next hour Google calendar. Can you but you know what you can't do which is frustrating is make a calendar entry or can you?
[01:21:18.380 --> 01:21:24.460]   Can you do that wasn't the issues with assistant? You couldn't just make it a calendar appointment or maybe you can I?
[01:21:24.460 --> 01:21:28.700]   Haven't I don't know yet. I don't have a pixel nor do I have a home yet?
[01:21:28.700 --> 01:21:30.900]   I know that's why you have to get one of the other
[01:21:30.900 --> 01:21:34.740]   You're getting a home though. I am getting home. Yeah, it's on the way
[01:21:34.740 --> 01:21:39.020]   So if this and that actually changed today
[01:21:39.980 --> 01:21:44.340]   They took all of their recipes down there no longer recipes. They're now applets
[01:21:44.340 --> 01:21:48.860]   Oh, they're controlled by the people who that they call them the service providers
[01:21:48.860 --> 01:21:54.820]   So the people who make the apps. Oh, this is what the pinboard guy was getting upset about. Yes
[01:21:54.820 --> 01:21:58.620]   The pin again like recently or was that no
[01:21:58.620 --> 01:22:06.380]   Remember they wanted him to there's a new was a new if this and that API and they wanted him to not only create it
[01:22:06.380 --> 01:22:13.980]   But to be responsible for it. Yeah, I guess this is this is what's happening now is this is the new if this and that so
[01:22:13.980 --> 01:22:18.700]   All of your old recipes. So if you're like me and you had a bunch of recipes, they're all now
[01:22:18.700 --> 01:22:21.100]   Applets and they still exist. Okay
[01:22:21.100 --> 01:22:25.900]   You're going right now only service providers can create
[01:22:25.900 --> 01:22:30.860]   Applets so no more can I give you a recipe of the day that you create oh
[01:22:30.860 --> 01:22:34.380]   Sadness
[01:22:34.380 --> 01:22:40.220]   So now only people who control the channel get to do it eventually they're gonna
[01:22:40.220 --> 01:22:44.820]   So it's gonna be plug and play you know what they probably decided people don't want to go to the effort of making a whole
[01:22:44.820 --> 01:22:51.780]   Reciply a lot of people didn't I mean to be fit to be totally honest, you know making a recipe requires you to know
[01:22:51.780 --> 01:22:55.500]   Yeah, I use Zapier and
[01:22:55.500 --> 01:23:00.300]   They still let you do it the way if this than that did and I would write highly
[01:23:00.300 --> 01:23:06.020]   It's not well, I think they have a free level, but it's and it's more complicated. You see you have to do all of this, you know
[01:23:06.020 --> 01:23:10.780]   Stuff but it's been thatting yeah, but it's great and I use it all the time
[01:23:10.780 --> 01:23:13.780]   But I bet it doesn't have the home automation stuff
[01:23:13.780 --> 01:23:17.900]   So on the home automation side and actually Microsoft just announced flows
[01:23:17.900 --> 01:23:22.140]   And I'm not I haven't played with that flow. Sorry flow. I haven't seen that yet
[01:23:22.140 --> 01:23:27.380]   But on the home automation side for iOS users. There's an app called stringify that you can use
[01:23:27.860 --> 01:23:33.380]   It doesn't have all of the things that if this and that had those so it's pretty limited
[01:23:33.380 --> 01:23:39.820]   So what's gonna happen to my recipes? I'm logging in they have they have now turned into applets, but they're not changed or turned off
[01:23:39.820 --> 01:23:43.460]   They're not changed. They're fine, but I can't make a new recipe by hand
[01:23:43.460 --> 01:23:46.260]   No, but they're gonna open up a maker tier
[01:23:46.260 --> 01:23:52.220]   Eventually, so if you want to be on the maker tier, I don't know how that happens
[01:23:52.220 --> 01:23:54.300]   Maybe if you have a lot of recipes that you've made
[01:23:55.740 --> 01:23:58.420]   Then eventually you will have that power again
[01:23:58.420 --> 01:24:06.740]   Well, but you can browse. I mean there's there's lots of lovely recipes. Yeah, I bet you what they found out was
[01:24:06.740 --> 01:24:12.300]   That's what people do. Yeah, right is that they they just click on other people's recipes
[01:24:12.300 --> 01:24:16.900]   So they have a bunch of collections applets. We love 15 applets for outer space
[01:24:16.900 --> 01:24:20.940]   I used to have an applet that would tell me whenever the International Space Station went overhead
[01:24:20.940 --> 01:24:24.020]   But the problem is it does that 20 times a day
[01:24:24.300 --> 01:24:27.580]   It does we had one on our giga ohm slack
[01:24:27.580 --> 01:24:32.300]   This is very giga ohm that told us it was a random bot that would be like
[01:24:32.300 --> 01:24:36.420]   Someone has launched into space. So anytime they send an astronaut to space
[01:24:36.420 --> 01:24:37.620]   They would tell us
[01:24:37.620 --> 01:24:44.020]   Someone has launched to just see what we really need and I bet you there's somewhere a geeky thing that could do this
[01:24:44.020 --> 01:24:50.380]   Is something a little more sophisticated for instance? I would have loved to have the ISS script say well is it after dark?
[01:24:50.980 --> 01:24:58.540]   Well, then tell me the ISS is overhead things like that, but they wanted Yahoo pipes. Yes remember that the late
[01:24:58.540 --> 01:25:06.900]   What maybe these things are just too hard for normal people to use they are
[01:25:06.900 --> 01:25:12.020]   Someone actually I was telling like a normal person about if this and that and they would looked at me
[01:25:12.020 --> 01:25:16.020]   They're like say you want me to go on my computer and
[01:25:17.380 --> 01:25:24.300]   Do what well they have an app they have a fairly easy to app, but you're right. This is why I hate normies
[01:25:24.300 --> 01:25:28.940]   This is yeah, this is why this is why we can't have nice things normies
[01:25:28.940 --> 01:25:36.100]   This is why there's probably a ceiling on my show your show. Yeah. Oh, well, we know there's a ceiling we reached it
[01:25:36.100 --> 01:25:40.380]   there's about a quarter of a million people who will listen to this kind of programming and
[01:25:41.740 --> 01:25:47.500]   Maybe that that number will go up over time. It does cut kind of every year five or ten percent increase, but
[01:25:47.500 --> 01:25:55.940]   We have a total unique audience of somewhere over five million and I figure that's probably
[01:25:55.940 --> 01:26:08.580]   The bottom of the geek barrel I gave a presentation to tech TV when they were really kind of going downhill and going more mainstream saying
[01:26:08.660 --> 01:26:14.180]   You know, there's what was it? I can't remember now. There's 41 billion program 41 million programmers in the United States
[01:26:14.180 --> 01:26:18.900]   If you made a channel that they loved you wouldn't have to worry
[01:26:18.900 --> 01:26:24.540]   But they didn't I guess, you know, it's too fragmented a crowd or whatever. I don't know
[01:26:24.540 --> 01:26:26.900]   to opinionated
[01:26:26.900 --> 01:26:28.900]   Well, actually that was their response
[01:26:28.900 --> 01:26:32.820]   Come to think of it. Really? Yeah, but Leo
[01:26:32.820 --> 01:26:35.740]   the problem is
[01:26:35.740 --> 01:26:37.900]   Those people are too smart
[01:26:37.900 --> 01:26:47.460]   They don't they don't buy brands brands need ignorant people and so advertisers don't want smart people because
[01:26:47.460 --> 01:26:53.180]   They don't you know, you're too smart to just buy tide for the rest of your life
[01:26:53.180 --> 01:26:58.900]   You actually might investigate what works best. They were very afraid. This was this was
[01:26:58.900 --> 01:27:02.900]   2001 or 2002 they were very afraid of the internet
[01:27:03.300 --> 01:27:09.620]   Enable consumer as they should have been but instead of saying oh, we don't want those people what they should have done is say
[01:27:09.620 --> 01:27:14.140]   Oh, well, maybe we'll make a better product the internet aware consumer will like
[01:27:14.140 --> 01:27:19.220]   Instead they said no, no, we just want dumb people brand. This was the this was the phrase
[01:27:19.220 --> 01:27:21.740]   I'll never forget a Joe Gillespie
[01:27:21.740 --> 01:27:24.380]   Credit to you with my friend
[01:27:24.380 --> 01:27:26.900]   Brand is the refuge of the of the ignorant
[01:27:26.900 --> 01:27:32.100]   Wow, how do all the Apple fanboys feel about that? Oh?
[01:27:33.100 --> 01:27:35.100]   Hmm
[01:27:35.100 --> 01:27:39.940]   That's what actually was my retort to him is well, why do people buy Apple?
[01:27:39.940 --> 01:27:44.380]   Maybe nowadays that retort wouldn't be as effective as it was then
[01:27:44.380 --> 01:27:48.580]   My applets
[01:27:48.580 --> 01:27:52.300]   Yeah, boy. They kind of they kind of took all the fun out of it
[01:27:52.300 --> 01:28:01.340]   I can't even see what they do. They're just tiles now. Oh, just click on one click on the echo or sorry click on automatic
[01:28:01.780 --> 01:28:06.860]   They're a sponsor of this fine. They're a sponsor of the show. Yeah automatic my applets
[01:28:06.860 --> 01:28:09.500]   Oh, I see so waves that was organized by provider
[01:28:09.500 --> 01:28:17.540]   Post trip info to ever note and then here's some more but I can't I can't just create one anymore
[01:28:17.540 --> 01:28:23.040]   Yeah, if you wanted to connect your automatic to something that no one has ever thought was reasonable. Yeah
[01:28:23.040 --> 01:28:26.740]   Terrible table. I know I get
[01:28:28.060 --> 01:28:34.060]   Zapier we use it. We use it here, right Carson's screaming in pain. We use it here all the time
[01:28:34.060 --> 01:28:39.300]   Why has Karsten screaming in pain? We use it all the time for all sorts of things for instance
[01:28:39.300 --> 01:28:42.060]   when I
[01:28:42.060 --> 01:28:44.060]   I wonder if that's gonna break my pin board
[01:28:44.060 --> 01:28:46.780]   recipe I
[01:28:46.780 --> 01:28:49.980]   Think I use Zapier. I don't know. I think I did so you're safe
[01:28:49.980 --> 01:28:55.860]   So one of the things that we do for this show and all the shows at Karsten and producers that I host is
[01:28:56.180 --> 01:29:02.300]   I use pin board as a bookmarking tool. So whenever I'm surfing the web if I see something I want I click my PB
[01:29:02.300 --> 01:29:09.780]   Button and it will automatically open up a little pin board window which I can then put some tags into usually twig
[01:29:09.780 --> 01:29:12.900]   the weak number this is week five seven eight and
[01:29:12.900 --> 01:29:21.880]   All that and then what it was doing was just going to pin board which is a delete was a delicious clone that came along when Yahoo destroyed delicious
[01:29:23.260 --> 01:29:30.060]   But Karsten said boy be a lot easier if you took your pin board feed and put it in a Google sheet for me and
[01:29:30.060 --> 01:29:36.260]   He sent me a template for what he wanted and it was very easy to do but I did it with Zapier Karsten I think
[01:29:36.260 --> 01:29:39.700]   So won't it won't him suppose that how you put things on the run down?
[01:29:39.700 --> 01:29:42.580]   Yeah, so it's easier for he still builds the rundown
[01:29:42.580 --> 01:29:44.820]   But now he can do it from a Google sheet to Google sheet
[01:29:44.820 --> 01:29:49.540]   So he just copies the line and I put the line in the form of use and paste it in so it's much easier for him
[01:29:49.540 --> 01:29:52.940]   And I don't know you know we've been doing this workflow
[01:29:53.180 --> 01:29:56.860]   For ten years. Yeah, Carson is the first guy who said you know
[01:29:56.860 --> 01:29:59.780]   If you just put in a sheet it would be a lot easier for me
[01:29:59.780 --> 01:30:05.140]   So anything I paste anything I bookmark on pin board now goes to a Google
[01:30:05.140 --> 01:30:10.660]   Sheet on Google jack I can show you probably you also label it per show as you yeah
[01:30:10.660 --> 01:30:16.540]   It's it's a tad the tats with the tags are for so it's Leo's links. So this will give you this is what it looks like
[01:30:17.540 --> 01:30:24.780]   It's the date I pinned it the headline the actual link and then the various tag numbers on it and
[01:30:24.780 --> 01:30:28.780]   He uses the tags you probably don't use it all that much
[01:30:28.780 --> 01:30:34.580]   But when I tag twig that means that this would be something that'd be good for twig and you can see I've been doing it oh
[01:30:34.580 --> 01:30:39.300]   Oh, I should start a September tab. I mean in October tab
[01:30:39.300 --> 01:30:45.940]   It's November you don't really care. Yeah, I had a September tab and I never met I was gonna break it up
[01:30:45.940 --> 01:30:47.940]   Because they're gonna get longer and longer. Do you delete him as you go?
[01:30:47.940 --> 01:30:52.180]   Okay, so
[01:30:52.180 --> 01:30:54.980]   But see this is automated from Zapier
[01:30:54.980 --> 01:31:02.180]   Hmm. Yeah, by the way, I don't know where we're gonna use this article, but I think I'm gonna use it right now
[01:31:02.180 --> 01:31:09.740]   I bookmarked it and I think we should this is this is the first order to find this is the this is the
[01:31:10.940 --> 01:31:12.940]   the unknown danger of
[01:31:12.940 --> 01:31:14.820]   surgical lasers
[01:31:14.820 --> 01:31:20.900]   Air-dory surgery after the patient farted in the middle of the operation while the doctors operated on the woman's cervix
[01:31:20.900 --> 01:31:25.860]   She apparently passed gas and then ended up being burned after the laser ignited the fart
[01:31:25.860 --> 01:31:31.540]   Resulting in a fiery explosion a committee of X is not a joke. I
[01:31:31.540 --> 01:31:35.100]   Cannot believe that's not a joke
[01:31:35.100 --> 01:31:39.900]   At the Tokyo medical University Hospital
[01:31:40.900 --> 01:31:42.900]   The
[01:31:42.900 --> 01:31:50.140]   Patience intestinal gas leaked into the space of the operation ignited with the irradiation of the laser the burning spread eventually reaching the surgical
[01:31:50.140 --> 01:31:52.140]   Draping causing a fire
[01:31:52.140 --> 01:31:56.020]   There you have it folks
[01:31:56.020 --> 01:32:00.260]   Patient burned
[01:32:00.260 --> 01:32:05.580]   They must have been doing like ablations and stuff inside people's like abdominal cavities
[01:32:05.580 --> 01:32:12.020]   You're saying is it's shocking this hasn't happened sooner. Well, I feel like people would like
[01:32:12.020 --> 01:32:16.220]   We should know about this this I smell snopes
[01:32:16.220 --> 01:32:22.820]   Yeah, I it does come from the New York daily news. How trustworthy is the New York daily news?
[01:32:22.820 --> 01:32:27.420]   What do you think Jeff?
[01:32:27.420 --> 01:32:29.900]   The GQ magazine that gets moto
[01:32:30.540 --> 01:32:37.020]   Middle floss who else run in this well everybody's probably the snopes. Let's see snopes. All right. What is snopes say two days ago?
[01:32:37.020 --> 01:32:39.020]   Snopes
[01:32:39.020 --> 01:32:44.660]   That's scroll down snopes. Come on. That's how I was hanging up on me spurts charged with investigating the incident
[01:32:44.660 --> 01:32:51.980]   Rule that there were no other flammable materials present at the time of surgery and the equipment that was used did not malfunction
[01:32:51.980 --> 01:32:55.420]   Leading them to believe the woman's flatulence was the culprit
[01:32:57.220 --> 01:33:05.260]   Desport woman this is this is this is what makes Howard Stern so successful as farts are just you can't help it laugh
[01:33:05.260 --> 01:33:12.380]   Well, it's this is our new segment on the show when technology strikes. What is this crashed?
[01:33:12.380 --> 01:33:14.860]   Can you focus just crashed and you look it up look up?
[01:33:14.860 --> 01:33:21.740]   fart laser fire and you'll see snopes down about father. I just crash plane from
[01:33:21.740 --> 01:33:26.700]   What does it what do they say?
[01:33:27.580 --> 01:33:29.580]   They just reported it. They didn't
[01:33:29.580 --> 01:33:32.780]   Look it's from the last time he's shimboon
[01:33:32.780 --> 01:33:38.660]   It's from this is from the asahi shimboon, which is a very I mean this is the New York Times of Japan
[01:33:38.660 --> 01:33:47.020]   If Snopes is repeating the rumor yes, Snopes is repeating it I
[01:33:47.020 --> 01:33:50.660]   Think that mean that's not let's get political fact on it
[01:33:50.660 --> 01:33:54.380]   Wow
[01:33:54.380 --> 01:34:00.180]   Wow this show has really taken a turn for the it is just really yes childish
[01:34:00.180 --> 01:34:07.140]   Let's let's find something as as fiery farts gone to the list of show titles yet or what's what how did you interpret this?
[01:34:07.140 --> 01:34:09.140]   Carson and your artistic name
[01:34:09.140 --> 01:34:14.060]   Whether we won't know till the end of the show will wait because there are other good good good candidates
[01:34:14.060 --> 01:34:19.580]   Crappy crap was that there? I think Google throne is my my front runner right now
[01:34:22.460 --> 01:34:25.500]   They're all it's interesting all scatological aren't they?
[01:34:25.500 --> 01:34:37.020]   Oh, do we have alphabet quarterly results we do third quarter results for alphabet, which is the Google parent corporation?
[01:34:37.020 --> 01:34:39.500]   we had
[01:34:39.500 --> 01:34:43.420]   Says Ruth poor at a great third quarter. Is that really?
[01:34:43.420 --> 01:34:49.060]   Scientifically accurate language a great third quarter 20% revenue growth year on year
[01:34:49.900 --> 01:34:53.300]   23% on a constant currency basis they have to do that there
[01:34:53.300 --> 01:35:01.060]   This is what happens in your big global company that your profits are influenced by the ebb and flow of the dollar against other currencies
[01:35:01.060 --> 01:35:08.780]   Mobile search and video powering our core advertising business and we're excited about the progress of newer businesses in Google and other bets
[01:35:08.780 --> 01:35:10.780]   let's look at other bets so
[01:35:10.780 --> 01:35:14.420]   20% increase in revenue year over year
[01:35:14.420 --> 01:35:18.180]   operating income gap
[01:35:18.700 --> 01:35:21.660]   5.76 billion operating margin gap
[01:35:21.660 --> 01:35:29.740]   26% we won't talk about non-gap because we believe in generally accepted accounting practices here here although
[01:35:29.740 --> 01:35:34.140]   non-gap is 7.6 billion in revenue or anything come
[01:35:34.140 --> 01:35:37.260]   uh, oh
[01:35:37.260 --> 01:35:40.580]   What's it there's an operating income and net income is financial analyst?
[01:35:40.580 --> 01:35:48.420]   Net income is lower down after you take out other stuff and the question is lower down
[01:35:48.420 --> 01:35:50.420]   But it's so it's kind of profit, but not exactly
[01:35:50.420 --> 01:35:58.020]   uh profit we come is net income is profit. It's it's the most as opposed to operating income operating
[01:35:58.020 --> 01:36:04.260]   Is that just I think operating is just minus your cost of goods like it doesn't take into account?
[01:36:04.260 --> 01:36:07.580]   uh, ebbita ebbita things like
[01:36:07.580 --> 01:36:10.580]   Immortization and stuff
[01:36:10.580 --> 01:36:13.140]   Immortization depreciation assets
[01:36:14.020 --> 01:36:18.420]   I don't know about stuff. Hey five billion in profit. Nothing to sneeze at for three months
[01:36:18.420 --> 01:36:21.860]   Ah
[01:36:21.860 --> 01:36:23.860]   I'd take it. I'd take it
[01:36:23.860 --> 01:36:27.220]   Now let's see here's the other bets
[01:36:27.220 --> 01:36:29.940]   197 million in revenue
[01:36:29.940 --> 01:36:34.180]   uh for an operating loss of wow 865 million dollars
[01:36:34.180 --> 01:36:39.300]   That's less it used to be 980 was 980 last year
[01:36:41.060 --> 01:36:44.660]   For this quarter last year, but that's a lot to lose almost a billion dollars a quarter
[01:36:44.660 --> 01:36:47.540]   Those are bets. That's big bets
[01:36:47.540 --> 01:36:51.940]   But wait, but what did you see the youtube numbers and they're not real?
[01:36:51.940 --> 01:36:57.380]   There's an analyst who was saying that youtube was making 10 billion dollars for google
[01:36:57.380 --> 01:36:59.460]   So they don't break google doesn't break that out
[01:36:59.460 --> 01:37:07.620]   It does not but maybe it should that feels pretty material. So uh as somebody who's effective tax rate
[01:37:09.300 --> 01:37:13.220]   Edges personally close to 50 percent because i'm in a high tax state
[01:37:13.220 --> 01:37:17.380]   Google's effective tax rate is remember mine mine 50
[01:37:17.380 --> 01:37:19.220]   like half
[01:37:19.220 --> 01:37:21.860]   Google's effective tax rate 16 percent this year
[01:37:21.860 --> 01:37:26.660]   And if I could do the irish run around in the Dutch sandwich, you better believe it
[01:37:26.660 --> 01:37:29.220]   I would be doing that now
[01:37:29.220 --> 01:37:33.220]   Uh, so there you go 16 percent. Hey, it's better. Nothing
[01:37:33.220 --> 01:37:37.300]   And they make so much money that's you know, they pay a lot more in taxes
[01:37:37.540 --> 01:37:40.100]   Every percent counts every percent counts
[01:37:40.100 --> 01:37:46.340]   Uh, it's getting better. They lose money the big bets lose money, but it's getting better
[01:37:46.340 --> 01:37:50.900]   Oh, I loved this story, uh, but that's because i'm an old hippie
[01:37:50.900 --> 01:37:55.940]   And I know and this might be another one for snopes because I got this message saying
[01:37:55.940 --> 01:37:59.060]   We should all check in
[01:37:59.060 --> 01:38:01.780]   to the standing rock indian reservation
[01:38:01.780 --> 01:38:04.180]   Because
[01:38:04.180 --> 01:38:07.300]   Someone had heard that the law enforcement this is where of course the
[01:38:07.300 --> 01:38:13.060]   The sit-in is going on in the protest of the north dakota oil pipeline that dakota access pipeline
[01:38:13.060 --> 01:38:14.660]   um
[01:38:14.660 --> 01:38:17.220]   Somebody said that the law enforcement agents were checking
[01:38:17.220 --> 01:38:19.620]   uh facebook
[01:38:19.620 --> 01:38:22.420]   Check-ins to see who was in the sit-in
[01:38:22.420 --> 01:38:24.420]   So
[01:38:24.420 --> 01:38:28.980]   Arse tekka wrote there is no way your facebook check-in is confusing north dakota cops
[01:38:28.980 --> 01:38:33.220]   I will I that was my reaction as well. However
[01:38:33.860 --> 01:38:39.300]   One and a half million people checked in on facebook in standing rock north dakota
[01:38:39.300 --> 01:38:44.420]   Okay, it's not hard to express solidarity with something that you think is not great with a click
[01:38:44.420 --> 01:38:49.940]   Yeah, I don't gotta go anywhere. I don't gotta sit. I can eat. I don't have to worry. Nobody's gonna arrest me
[01:38:49.940 --> 01:38:57.700]   That's the little point in participatory democracy right there. There are 140 roughly 140 protesters, but they're one and a half million check-ins
[01:38:59.140 --> 01:39:03.300]   Yeah, yeah, it is kind of kind of that but I but it showed again. This is
[01:39:03.300 --> 01:39:08.900]   You weren't here last week where we showed how that simple register to vote announcement on facebook
[01:39:08.900 --> 01:39:11.540]   created massive spikes
[01:39:11.540 --> 01:39:15.540]   In voter registration like in order of four five six times
[01:39:15.540 --> 01:39:21.540]   Higher voter registration. It's just this is kind of all about an ongoing segment on this show
[01:39:21.540 --> 01:39:24.100]   Wow facebook is big
[01:39:24.100 --> 01:39:27.380]   Do you know what what
[01:39:27.460 --> 01:39:32.500]   I was so this is so frustrating to me because one people will feel like they're being activists
[01:39:32.500 --> 01:39:37.460]   With their clicks. Yeah, they're really doing anything. Yeah, well not just that but
[01:39:37.460 --> 01:39:40.740]   Facebook controls
[01:39:40.740 --> 01:39:45.300]   What people see not just with algorithms but their ability to censor their platform because it
[01:39:45.300 --> 01:39:54.100]   It's their platform. I'm not arguing with their ability to do so, but we can't feel like what if facebook suddenly decides it really supports
[01:39:55.540 --> 01:39:59.300]   this particular pipeline, which I doubt but
[01:39:59.300 --> 01:40:02.500]   it's just
[01:40:02.500 --> 01:40:09.140]   We're not doing anything and we're feeling like we're we're putting all our agency in something that ultimately doesn't deserve it
[01:40:09.140 --> 01:40:13.700]   Sorry, yeah, it's like a vote
[01:40:13.700 --> 01:40:19.460]   It's like a way of standing up. I mean I understand and you should also
[01:40:19.460 --> 01:40:21.700]   donate and
[01:40:21.700 --> 01:40:24.260]   Spend time and participate physically
[01:40:24.900 --> 01:40:26.900]   Look at jeff he went and canvassed in
[01:40:26.900 --> 01:40:32.980]   Uh, pennsylvania, I mean that there's nothing there's no substitute for that
[01:40:32.980 --> 01:40:39.700]   But there's also room if you're doing that to also show how you feel about something to take a stand to change your
[01:40:39.700 --> 01:40:43.860]   You know facebook or your twitter avatar to you know
[01:40:43.860 --> 01:40:46.660]   logo or a
[01:40:46.660 --> 01:40:53.300]   Countries flag. I know I'm not against that unless it's the only thing you do and then you go see I do care
[01:40:53.940 --> 01:41:00.820]   It's less that it's not actually that it's more that facebook or twitter or anyone can decide
[01:41:00.820 --> 01:41:04.900]   To stop showing that at any point in time if they haven't but they don't
[01:41:04.900 --> 01:41:09.460]   They have in other cases. I think about like breastfeeding moms getting
[01:41:09.460 --> 01:41:12.180]   I mean they got a lot of heat and they change that
[01:41:12.180 --> 01:41:19.060]   Finally, I think they're smart enough now to understand that they should be careful about that kind of thing
[01:41:20.180 --> 01:41:25.780]   I know they're still doing it. They took down the famous vietnam girl napalm picture. Yes, they did
[01:41:25.780 --> 01:41:27.940]   I was just think I was like
[01:41:27.940 --> 01:41:32.900]   Change their policy, but again, but that's facebook isn't it they do it then apologize later
[01:41:32.900 --> 01:41:37.220]   But I I think they also understand and they're increasingly understanding that
[01:41:37.220 --> 01:41:42.020]   Any small thing they do has a huge impact and so they've got to be very very very careful
[01:41:42.020 --> 01:41:45.220]   It's kind of like seeing the erosion of white privilege in real time
[01:41:45.700 --> 01:41:51.620]   If you think about like the decisions they make and you're like, oh boom or not white privilege male privilege just privilege privilege
[01:41:51.620 --> 01:41:56.340]   Privilege because it could be oh yeah, right, but it privilege privileges privilege
[01:41:56.340 --> 01:41:59.380]   um
[01:41:59.380 --> 01:42:04.660]   Vine shutting down twitter's cutting 9% of its workforce. Some of that will be the people who do vine
[01:42:04.660 --> 01:42:07.460]   the vine
[01:42:07.460 --> 01:42:10.820]   I love this mic article we talked about it on sunday
[01:42:12.260 --> 01:42:19.220]   Inside the meeting the change the fate of vine forever apparently 20 of the top creators of vine gathered according to mic
[01:42:19.220 --> 01:42:21.860]   M. I see the mic network
[01:42:21.860 --> 01:42:29.940]   Was it last year the year before saying we're losing viewers vine you're not making the changes the platform you need to make so
[01:42:29.940 --> 01:42:32.100]   Here's the deal
[01:42:32.100 --> 01:42:34.980]   if you pay us 1.2 million dollars each
[01:42:34.980 --> 01:42:38.100]   Make some product changes
[01:42:38.340 --> 01:42:44.740]   Open up a more direct line of communication to us. We agree to give you 12 pieces of monthly content or three vines per week for a year
[01:42:44.740 --> 01:42:50.900]   And vine said no and see they were right because vine's gone
[01:42:50.900 --> 01:42:58.660]   Proved him right here's vine's biggest star. Have you ever heard of king bock?
[01:42:58.660 --> 01:43:04.420]   No, no, but I like a suit tux. It's good looking guy
[01:43:05.940 --> 01:43:13.300]   Disappear will eventually they can copy it off. Yeah, no place to put it the creator of vine
[01:43:13.300 --> 01:43:17.540]   Uh who sold it to twitter for I think 30 million dollars
[01:43:17.540 --> 01:43:20.180]   tweeted
[01:43:20.180 --> 01:43:22.180]   Simple tweet four words
[01:43:22.180 --> 01:43:24.180]   Don't sell your company
[01:43:24.180 --> 01:43:27.380]   Is he gonna give the money back? I don't think so
[01:43:27.380 --> 01:43:32.820]   Can you buy it back for a dollar? Maybe they've actually created a new app. Did you I actually tried it out?
[01:43:33.380 --> 01:43:39.060]   Before the show that's why I was retying my bow tie. It's called hype just came out today on iOS
[01:43:39.060 --> 01:43:43.380]   As far as I can tell it's periscope or miercat. It's a live
[01:43:43.380 --> 01:43:45.380]   streaming platform
[01:43:45.380 --> 01:43:48.660]   I guess too, maybe they're hoping that the the vine stars will come back
[01:43:48.660 --> 01:43:52.500]   But this is so different from what vine was vine was heavily edited six second
[01:43:52.500 --> 01:44:00.820]   Videos this is live streaming very disappointed to see that I at my bow tying did not get into the popular today section
[01:44:01.860 --> 01:44:03.860]   uh vine is a little more um
[01:44:03.860 --> 01:44:06.340]   I mean, uh hype is a more
[01:44:06.340 --> 01:44:09.780]   Different than periscope because you see your circle
[01:44:09.780 --> 01:44:13.220]   And these sparkles are like thumbs up or hearts
[01:44:13.220 --> 01:44:18.740]   And you can see I don't know what those images are you can put images in video. You can actually produce it a little bit more
[01:44:18.740 --> 01:44:22.980]   Uh, and then there's comments. This is a uh
[01:44:22.980 --> 01:44:25.860]   vine replay
[01:44:25.860 --> 01:44:27.860]   I don't know how to get out of it because
[01:44:30.180 --> 01:44:32.580]   I'm because of iOS has no controls
[01:44:32.580 --> 01:44:40.660]   Wow, look at all these people tony tommy hawk how easy kurtney kurrier. They all got more hits than I did
[01:44:40.660 --> 01:44:43.860]   And I guess nobody wanted to know how to tie a bow tie
[01:44:43.860 --> 01:44:46.580]   Oh, there's cali louis
[01:44:46.580 --> 01:44:48.580]   She's using hype hype
[01:44:48.580 --> 01:44:54.340]   It's kind of snap chatty right. I mean it does feel snap chatty. Yeah
[01:44:54.340 --> 01:44:57.540]   It's snapchat meets periscope, maybe
[01:44:58.500 --> 01:45:00.500]   so
[01:45:00.500 --> 01:45:05.780]   What is happening here? Uh, maybe there's audio. She's got a lot of people watching
[01:45:05.780 --> 01:45:14.100]   I don't know. Yeah, she's talking and showing pop close up of popcorn. Oh, there you go
[01:45:14.100 --> 01:45:16.900]   Oh, she's learning how to use it is what it is
[01:45:16.900 --> 01:45:24.100]   So that's as like as with a lot of us. This is you know, we're just using it for the first time
[01:45:25.060 --> 01:45:27.780]   It's a iOS only no android well
[01:45:27.780 --> 01:45:33.620]   Remember all vine it took a long time to give vine on android wasn't on the internet. It's right. Yeah
[01:45:33.620 --> 01:45:37.300]   Once again early adopters. Yeah
[01:45:37.300 --> 01:45:41.940]   Uh family is suing amazon
[01:45:41.940 --> 01:45:46.340]   Because their hoverboard destroyed their entire house
[01:45:46.340 --> 01:45:48.420]   Oh
[01:45:48.420 --> 01:45:51.780]   This is bad the hoverboard was a soul. That's a bad fire
[01:45:52.340 --> 01:45:55.220]   Hoverboard was sold on amazon
[01:45:55.220 --> 01:45:58.180]   not by amazon
[01:45:58.180 --> 01:46:00.100]   but uh
[01:46:00.100 --> 01:46:01.220]   the
[01:46:01.220 --> 01:46:07.220]   Owners in nashville contend that amazon at its various subsidiaries had information about the dangerousness of the product
[01:46:07.220 --> 01:46:09.540]   Well in advance of the january 9th fire
[01:46:09.540 --> 01:46:14.100]   Their son of amazon is liable for everything that it's sold in its marketplace. E
[01:46:14.100 --> 01:46:16.580]   Yeah, yeah
[01:46:16.580 --> 01:46:19.780]   No one was hurt. Although it was sounds like it was close six members of the family
[01:46:20.100 --> 01:46:23.220]   The father rescued two of his children from the second floor of the burning home
[01:46:23.220 --> 01:46:26.340]   Dear god, uh, yeah, no kidding
[01:46:26.340 --> 01:46:29.060]   Um
[01:46:29.060 --> 01:46:33.700]   The lawsuit says the seller of the hoverboard listed online w deals as a sham organization
[01:46:33.700 --> 01:46:36.660]   registered to an apartment in new york city
[01:46:36.660 --> 01:46:40.180]   They haven't responded to uh, the lawsuit
[01:46:40.180 --> 01:46:46.500]   so, um, it it alleges this suit alleges a family who sold a counterfeit product from china and not a brand
[01:46:48.020 --> 01:46:54.900]   With a sam san lithium ion battery as listed on amazon. Although these days that wouldn't necessarily be any assurance of safety
[01:46:54.900 --> 01:46:57.540]   Texas sounds like oh
[01:46:57.540 --> 01:47:00.180]   Go ahead
[01:47:00.180 --> 01:47:03.780]   This sounds like they're suing amazon because they can't sue anybody else precisely
[01:47:03.780 --> 01:47:09.380]   They're actually 10 defendants including amazon and retailers, but you know you you sue whoever has the
[01:47:09.380 --> 01:47:11.860]   Deep pockets
[01:47:11.860 --> 01:47:14.180]   Tennessee product liability law holds a seller
[01:47:14.180 --> 01:47:16.980]   Responsible if the manufacturer can't be found
[01:47:17.620 --> 01:47:22.820]   And they they have not been able to get the manufacturer as with I would guess many hoverboards
[01:47:22.820 --> 01:47:25.220]   You know
[01:47:25.220 --> 01:47:28.900]   And by the way, this underscores something that amazon does. I don't know if people know this
[01:47:28.900 --> 01:47:35.060]   You do if you spend enough time on amazon, so we we order everything on amazon and
[01:47:35.060 --> 01:47:37.940]   if you're not like paying attention
[01:47:37.940 --> 01:47:39.780]   like
[01:47:39.780 --> 01:47:40.740]   we'll get
[01:47:40.740 --> 01:47:45.860]   we get like we ordered some lemon pledge and we got like a like a hand wrapped
[01:47:46.740 --> 01:47:50.340]   Box of loose lemon pledge bottles in the mail from las vegas it wasn't
[01:47:50.340 --> 01:47:54.500]   Because even though it was on amazon, there's all sorts of levels
[01:47:54.500 --> 01:47:58.900]   There's lots of people use amazon for fulfillment lots of people who use amazon to sell but fulfill it themselves
[01:47:58.900 --> 01:48:04.900]   When you're buying on amazon you're buying you could be buying from a lot of different places that you don't even know about
[01:48:04.900 --> 01:48:08.980]   And amazon to themselves do some very odd things. I have a good friend
[01:48:08.980 --> 01:48:11.540]   Who sells a product on amazon?
[01:48:11.940 --> 01:48:18.180]   It's a water ionizer. He has the maid in china puts his companies during the manufacturing process
[01:48:18.180 --> 01:48:21.060]   Company name on it the name whatever brand name they made up
[01:48:21.060 --> 01:48:25.380]   He buys advertisements for it and it's on amazon for sale on amazon
[01:48:25.380 --> 01:48:31.300]   But amazon is algarednik. So all of a sudden his sales like in one day went to nothing
[01:48:31.300 --> 01:48:40.340]   And he looked on amazon did a search for his company's name and the product and amazon was selling it his product with his brand name on it
[01:48:41.060 --> 01:48:46.340]   Less than he was selling it for they had determined algarednik. They could and it just happened
[01:48:46.340 --> 01:48:51.620]   So he played a game with him he lowered his price and then the amazon price went through the roof
[01:48:51.620 --> 01:48:53.620]   Because they figured well, I can't match this price
[01:48:53.620 --> 01:48:56.660]   We'll just see if we can get somebody and sell them to it for a lot and this is all done
[01:48:56.660 --> 01:48:59.140]   I'm sure not by a human but completely algorithmically
[01:48:59.140 --> 01:49:05.620]   So amazon is a very you're not often you're not buying from amazon. Sometimes you're not even fulfilled by amazon
[01:49:05.620 --> 01:49:08.180]   It's completely a third party
[01:49:08.580 --> 01:49:13.860]   Often I think and I have some evidence for this because we've bought some expensive stuff
[01:49:13.860 --> 01:49:18.340]   It's just some guy who's reselling using amazon as a conduit. He never has the merchandise
[01:49:18.340 --> 01:49:23.300]   He just routes it through right? I think that's what happened with this hoverboard. It was just an apartment
[01:49:23.300 --> 01:49:26.500]   He wasn't he never had any merchandise to sell
[01:49:26.500 --> 01:49:32.180]   So be I think you got to be careful and this is this gets down to the bag buying batteries and
[01:49:32.180 --> 01:49:36.820]   apple reporters cables apple reported like 90% of all the
[01:49:37.780 --> 01:49:42.660]   Lightning cables sold on amazon were fraudulent were fake were bad cables
[01:49:42.660 --> 01:49:46.660]   Even though they had the made for iphone logo on it
[01:49:46.660 --> 01:49:51.300]   And they're suing because there's probably suing amazon as well as whoever's doing this
[01:49:51.300 --> 01:49:55.460]   Because amazon doesn't do any oversight at all you put you can make anything you want as a list
[01:49:55.460 --> 01:49:57.300]   It's like buying
[01:49:57.300 --> 01:50:00.980]   On ebay even though you know is it a seller marketplace. Yeah
[01:50:00.980 --> 01:50:03.780]   so the can they do is
[01:50:03.780 --> 01:50:06.260]   buy stuff that's sold by amazon
[01:50:07.380 --> 01:50:09.140]   Fulfilled by amazon right?
[01:50:09.140 --> 01:50:14.100]   I think a lot of people get burnt by that some some as you can see literally
[01:50:14.100 --> 01:50:19.300]   So I have to ask because hoverboards were last year's hot christmas gift
[01:50:19.300 --> 01:50:25.380]   What is I don't feel like we've seen something or did I miss it?
[01:50:25.380 --> 01:50:28.260]   Oh, yeah, we saw a few things
[01:50:28.260 --> 01:50:32.740]   Everything everything everything goes through here. What is that robot that?
[01:50:34.100 --> 01:50:37.700]   Uh, megan had do you anybody remember it was a cosmo or osmo
[01:50:37.700 --> 01:50:41.860]   the omate maybe the one that talks to the echo
[01:50:41.860 --> 01:50:45.380]   Maybe that was it
[01:50:45.380 --> 01:50:49.620]   It plays games. It has it's done. It was designed by
[01:50:49.620 --> 01:50:53.380]   uh, some folks who used to work at
[01:50:53.380 --> 01:51:00.900]   Pixar so it has a lot yeah, it's maybe it is the omate. Oh no are you talking about the toy talk stuff?
[01:51:01.140 --> 01:51:04.500]   No toy talks are cool too. I like that. We've interviewed those guys
[01:51:04.500 --> 01:51:09.860]   Let's see if these guys are amazing the omate. Uh, no, this isn't it. Although this is kind of cool too
[01:51:09.860 --> 01:51:15.300]   It was cosmo cosmo on keys robot on kespa. That's right
[01:51:15.300 --> 01:51:20.740]   Yeah, now this I don't know you know if this will be the toy of the holiday
[01:51:20.740 --> 01:51:27.380]   But we played with it was really super cool. Only negative is it's kind of pricey. It's like 150 bucks 160 bucks
[01:51:28.100 --> 01:51:33.860]   It's kind of like the little bba wasn't bba when he was very expensive. That was the toy last year, right?
[01:51:33.860 --> 01:51:36.580]   I
[01:51:36.580 --> 01:51:39.220]   This thing look at this look at its face. It has a lot of character
[01:51:39.220 --> 01:51:41.060]   Makes sounds
[01:51:41.060 --> 01:51:45.780]   If it really you feel like it's kind of looking at you and it recognizes you it has a camera on it
[01:51:45.780 --> 01:51:50.100]   And it oh my gosh. That was fun. Yeah, see see
[01:51:50.100 --> 01:51:54.660]   879.99. How neat now how now how much would you pay?
[01:51:57.380 --> 01:52:02.820]   But on key did those that great racetrack which I have because I gave it to my son for christmas and he never wanted it
[01:52:02.820 --> 01:52:05.140]   um
[01:52:05.140 --> 01:52:10.100]   So maybe you can buy my daughter stuff for christmas. Yeah, maybe i'll send you my onky racetrack. That's actually pretty cool
[01:52:10.100 --> 01:52:17.140]   Um, so this is like bba only a little bit smarter. I like they have a girl to play with it. Yeah, exactly
[01:52:17.140 --> 01:52:24.020]   And it has one additional feature which I like it has an sdk and you can write software for it in python
[01:52:26.100 --> 01:52:31.380]   So that's kind of interesting, right? So it starts is just kind of a plug and play consumer thing
[01:52:31.380 --> 01:52:35.940]   But it can get a little bit more sophisticated
[01:52:35.940 --> 01:52:42.020]   So there's my vote for at least one of the hot toys of the year
[01:52:42.020 --> 01:52:44.420]   All right
[01:52:44.420 --> 01:52:46.420]   It's too expensive though to really be a
[01:52:46.420 --> 01:52:48.340]   Huge one, right?
[01:52:48.340 --> 01:52:53.140]   Well, how about broden was expensive? I'm just thinking like a hot tech hot tech kind of thing
[01:52:53.220 --> 01:52:58.740]   That's the hot tech right there right there at the cosmos robots right or a tesla glass roof
[01:52:58.740 --> 01:53:01.140]   Oh
[01:53:01.140 --> 01:53:07.460]   So so have you ordered yours already leo can't order it can you if I if I did I could we already have solar city panels
[01:53:07.460 --> 01:53:09.540]   I'm a little disappointed
[01:53:09.540 --> 01:53:11.940]   Oh, see this is what happens when you're an early doctor
[01:53:11.940 --> 01:53:12.900]   Oh
[01:53:12.900 --> 01:53:16.980]   My test is also off obsolete because two weeks ago or last week
[01:53:16.980 --> 01:53:22.260]   Elon announced that all the new teslas have 18 cameras and two hikis and the vsef driving and I mind
[01:53:22.260 --> 01:53:24.260]   Doesn't have any of that stuff
[01:53:24.260 --> 01:53:28.980]   So what do you think about him?
[01:53:28.980 --> 01:53:34.740]   Decreeing that you can't make money with his self-driving car. Oh, that's eon and i'm not sure
[01:53:34.740 --> 01:53:37.060]   That's yeah, it is but it's really a troubling
[01:53:37.060 --> 01:53:41.620]   It is the end of the ownership like kind of yeah concept
[01:53:41.620 --> 01:53:46.900]   But we've already been there. I mean remember when amazon and the kindle and blah blah blah
[01:53:46.900 --> 01:53:48.820]   I know same thing
[01:53:48.820 --> 01:53:53.460]   But jesus you spend a fortune and you can't use it as you wish to do what you wish in life. It's a that's just
[01:53:53.460 --> 01:53:57.060]   There's still other alternatives
[01:53:57.060 --> 01:54:02.900]   So this is let me just show you the new model s because of course you have to pay for the enhanced auto pilot
[01:54:02.900 --> 01:54:04.900]   Which is going to act add a little bit
[01:54:04.900 --> 01:54:07.780]   Uh, it's $6,000 extra
[01:54:07.780 --> 01:54:12.980]   6,000. Oh, and did you want full self-driving capability? Well, you check that box that adds
[01:54:12.980 --> 01:54:14.900]   $4,000
[01:54:14.900 --> 01:54:16.420]   okay, so
[01:54:16.420 --> 01:54:20.900]   What does self-driving doubles the numbers of active cameras from four to eight navel full self-driving?
[01:54:20.900 --> 01:54:25.780]   I only have I think one camera in mind. You only have one on yours as well. I should say stacy
[01:54:25.780 --> 01:54:31.460]   Please note self-driving functionality is dependent upon extensive software validation and regulatory approval
[01:54:31.460 --> 01:54:34.260]   Which may vary widely by jurisdiction in other words
[01:54:34.260 --> 01:54:40.420]   You may never get it. It's not possible to know exactly when each element of the functionality described above will be available
[01:54:40.420 --> 01:54:43.220]   As this is highly dependent on local regulatory approval
[01:54:43.620 --> 01:54:49.460]   So this is very typical of elan, which is you know, he's selling the sci-fi he's selling the dream not the reality
[01:54:49.460 --> 01:54:51.300]   But here's the part you're talking about jeff
[01:54:51.300 --> 01:54:58.100]   Please note also they're using a self-driving tesla for car sharing and ride hailing for friends and family is fine
[01:54:58.100 --> 01:55:02.980]   But doing so for revenue purposes will only be permissible on the tesla network
[01:55:02.980 --> 01:55:07.700]   Details of which will be released next to that's restraint of trade. It's something wrong
[01:55:07.700 --> 01:55:11.620]   Is it illegal though? Probably not
[01:55:12.260 --> 01:55:15.540]   You can you can say when you sell something it can only be used this way
[01:55:15.540 --> 01:55:19.540]   Oh, we know we just there was just a legal decision that I think affects this
[01:55:19.540 --> 01:55:26.900]   You can now have your car. Oh, yeah, that's the librarian of congress. Okay, so that's an interesting case which
[01:55:26.900 --> 01:55:29.620]   as of the first of november
[01:55:29.620 --> 01:55:31.060]   um
[01:55:31.060 --> 01:55:33.060]   And this is a two-year trial
[01:55:33.060 --> 01:55:36.900]   You can hack your car or your device and this all comes from
[01:55:37.540 --> 01:55:43.540]   Uh, the you know the dmca which makes it illegal to reverse engineer protected software
[01:55:43.540 --> 01:55:50.660]   Which allows things like john dier to say you can't maintain your own tractor because we don't want anybody to steal the code in our tractors
[01:55:50.660 --> 01:55:54.020]   um, and so the copyright office
[01:55:54.020 --> 01:55:59.060]   Which rules on these kinds of things the library of congress runs the copyright office
[01:55:59.060 --> 01:56:01.220]   last year
[01:56:01.220 --> 01:56:03.460]   A full year ago
[01:56:03.460 --> 01:56:04.500]   said
[01:56:04.500 --> 01:56:08.580]   We're gonna allow for the repair of digital repair of vehicles
[01:56:08.580 --> 01:56:12.420]   We're gonna allow for circumventing protections on copyrighted systems
[01:56:12.420 --> 01:56:17.460]   for consumer devices next year and it just went into effect
[01:56:17.460 --> 01:56:20.180]   for a two-year period
[01:56:20.180 --> 01:56:22.820]   the security exemption
[01:56:22.820 --> 01:56:24.820]   uh for researchers
[01:56:24.820 --> 01:56:30.500]   Only applies to good faith testing and a controlled environment designed to avoid any harm to individuals or the public
[01:56:31.300 --> 01:56:34.580]   We're not talking about testing your neighbor's pacemaker while it's implanted
[01:56:34.580 --> 01:56:37.860]   We're talking about a controlled lab and a device on by a researcher
[01:56:37.860 --> 01:56:39.700]   but
[01:56:39.700 --> 01:56:45.380]   It for researchers. This is huge. Remember ed felt and to go back to voting for instant professor
[01:56:45.380 --> 01:56:49.780]   Who was able to show that the debold voting machines were eminently hackable
[01:56:49.780 --> 01:56:53.780]   Debold suit him saying that's a violation of our copyright
[01:56:53.780 --> 01:56:56.740]   You can't do this kind of research
[01:56:58.180 --> 01:57:02.260]   So this is uh, this is very important and very good news and I hope that it gets extended
[01:57:02.260 --> 01:57:04.820]   um, sony suge george hott's remember
[01:57:04.820 --> 01:57:07.540]   for hacking a sony playstation
[01:57:07.540 --> 01:57:13.860]   So that gives you the right to modify does it does that not mean you have the right to use as you wish
[01:57:13.860 --> 01:57:18.580]   To modify the use. I don't think this applies to this. I think uh
[01:57:18.580 --> 01:57:21.620]   I just find it offensive
[01:57:21.620 --> 01:57:24.980]   You know when you buy a computer you can't use it to make it
[01:57:24.980 --> 01:57:28.100]   You know most of the terms of agreement say you can't use it to make nuclear weapons
[01:57:28.100 --> 01:57:32.900]   Well, this is making a living but i'm just saying this is a long standing
[01:57:32.900 --> 01:57:36.180]   Um, but no really really
[01:57:36.180 --> 01:57:37.860]   Why do you grab my allergy?
[01:57:37.860 --> 01:57:41.460]   So so you buy a pair of scissors and you're told you can only use this
[01:57:41.460 --> 01:57:44.020]   Uh to cut uh your kids
[01:57:44.020 --> 01:57:47.140]   Acostums you can't use this to start a tailor business
[01:57:47.140 --> 01:57:53.460]   Give give me any analogy where you will buy something and you were told you cannot use it
[01:57:54.340 --> 01:57:56.340]   To your own end
[01:57:56.340 --> 01:58:03.780]   Well, you can't use your apple computer to make nuclear weapons. Well, okay, but that's that's a security
[01:58:03.780 --> 01:58:10.660]   Yes, you as opposed to a that's not that's not oh oh yes, you can you can use these not any competitive
[01:58:10.660 --> 01:58:14.340]   You can use these scissors to cut clothes, but only if you sell them with ramazan
[01:58:14.340 --> 01:58:17.780]   only if you if you
[01:58:17.780 --> 01:58:20.100]   Buy the fabric from me
[01:58:21.620 --> 01:58:23.620]   I don't know
[01:58:23.620 --> 01:58:26.100]   I don't know it's a good question
[01:58:26.100 --> 01:58:36.180]   I am not a lawyer, but I bet you on friday, why we like howl and her team of cracked lawyers will
[01:58:36.180 --> 01:58:39.540]   That's what i would love to hear. That's why i wanted to bring it up. Yeah, this we can law it denise
[01:58:39.540 --> 01:58:42.660]   If you haven't already talked about it, that'd be a good one for a
[01:58:42.660 --> 01:58:45.540]   For this week
[01:58:45.540 --> 01:58:46.500]   Uh
[01:58:46.500 --> 01:58:51.780]   Do do do do do do do officially now oracle is going to appeal it's loss against google
[01:58:51.780 --> 01:58:53.780]   I guess it's going to the supreme court
[01:58:53.780 --> 01:58:59.380]   I mean we have to talk about oracle and google. Yeah, and uh
[01:58:59.380 --> 01:59:04.260]   Actually goes to the us court of appeals for the federal circuit so it goes up to the circuit court
[01:59:04.260 --> 01:59:07.940]   Uh, and then after that would be the supreme court
[01:59:07.940 --> 01:59:14.420]   Oh, that's right because it got tossed back from one appellate court for something else and then oh and and unfortunately the federal circuit is
[01:59:14.980 --> 01:59:22.180]   Very patent holder friendly. It's not it's not the one you really want this. This is the can apis be copyrighted
[01:59:22.180 --> 01:59:26.980]   Whole thing actually I think that's already been decided apis can be copyrighted
[01:59:26.980 --> 01:59:32.420]   That's the federal circuit decided that and then now they have to decide
[01:59:32.420 --> 01:59:37.460]   Uh, what is it the whether the uh
[01:59:37.460 --> 01:59:41.380]   Is the award appropriate
[01:59:42.260 --> 01:59:45.060]   I can't remember what it is there. It's so confusing what they're gonna
[01:59:45.060 --> 01:59:51.780]   Think it's over the this is where jeff and i are just like yeah, leo you just read all
[01:59:51.780 --> 01:59:56.260]   I don't usually like to do court stuff to be honest, but this says google in the title. So
[01:59:56.260 --> 01:59:58.820]   I know it does
[01:59:58.820 --> 02:00:04.420]   We we appreciate you bearing that burden. Oh, this is the fair use. That's right. This is the fair use test. So now
[02:00:04.420 --> 02:00:10.660]   Now so the jury found that it was fair that that the google's use of the apis was fair use
[02:00:11.300 --> 02:00:15.460]   Not that the apis weren't copyrighted, but it was fair use to use them and now they're going to see
[02:00:15.460 --> 02:00:21.860]   The circuit court is going to be asked whether that is in fact fair use, which is okay. That's good. We got a we need more
[02:00:21.860 --> 02:00:26.020]   Fair use cases frankly. We use fair use as a defense all the time
[02:00:26.020 --> 02:00:36.260]   Potis at potus on twitter is not going to stay as I think everybody knew with president obama the new president will get at potus
[02:00:37.780 --> 02:00:47.300]   I will also get the facebook the youtube the snapchat the instagram the flicker the vimeo the itunes and even the myspace accounts
[02:00:47.300 --> 02:00:50.900]   I bet it also had a vine. I bet there was a vine
[02:00:50.900 --> 02:00:54.900]   Once there was a vine
[02:00:54.900 --> 02:01:03.620]   Uh eight years of digital first 470 000 weed the people petitions 30 000 at white house tweets thousands of video footage
[02:01:04.660 --> 02:01:10.340]   And the president this is great has made it clear that a smooth transition between administrations
[02:01:10.340 --> 02:01:13.620]   And their social media accounts is key
[02:01:13.620 --> 02:01:20.900]   No, I added the social media accounts part actually what's interesting all the imagine that account and in a certain person's hands
[02:01:20.900 --> 02:01:23.780]   I can't wait
[02:01:23.780 --> 02:01:25.780]   Uh by the way imagine
[02:01:25.780 --> 02:01:31.220]   All of the all of the president's stuff. He's really the first social media president, right? Yes
[02:01:31.860 --> 02:01:36.420]   All of the president's stuff will go in the national archives and records administration from tweets to snaps
[02:01:36.420 --> 02:01:44.500]   Wasn't all of our our tweets weren't they already all in the library of congress? Yes, the twitter gave up gave them a hard drive
[02:01:44.500 --> 02:01:48.660]   All the tweets are on here really
[02:01:48.660 --> 02:01:51.140]   uh
[02:01:51.140 --> 02:01:56.340]   And the handle at potus will be made available to the 45th president on january 20th
[02:01:56.980 --> 02:02:02.420]   Uh as he is sworn in the president will say oh here's the password. Don't give me a little piece of paper. Here's a password
[02:02:02.420 --> 02:02:05.540]   11 million followers
[02:02:05.540 --> 02:02:10.580]   Here's a button and the password. Yeah followers stay the tweets disappear the previous tweets are gone
[02:02:10.580 --> 02:02:16.820]   Well, but replet but what else where aren't they put on another account for archival purpose? Otis 44. Yeah
[02:02:16.820 --> 02:02:23.940]   So at potus 44 will uh continue to contain all of president obama assuming i will help twitter on that
[02:02:24.420 --> 02:02:27.700]   That's actually pretty good. Yeah, you know it is and of course set nara
[02:02:27.700 --> 02:02:32.180]   At what about michelle obama does she have a does do we have a
[02:02:32.180 --> 02:02:38.980]   What's her? She's not a lotus or facebook accounts for the president vice president and the instagram accounts belonging to the first lady
[02:02:38.980 --> 02:02:43.140]   And vice president will be moved to the new 44 usernames as well and preserved by nara
[02:02:43.140 --> 02:02:45.860]   But lotus floaters might become
[02:02:45.860 --> 02:02:49.140]   What did that be?
[02:02:49.140 --> 02:02:51.140]   Oh, well, we've had a
[02:02:51.140 --> 02:02:53.140]   No, no, no, uh
[02:02:53.140 --> 02:02:55.140]   Actually, I don't think there's an otis for that
[02:02:55.140 --> 02:03:01.140]   But he will be called the first gentleman. I believe there's a whole protocol thing
[02:03:01.140 --> 02:03:04.260]   They're trying to figure that out if and it is an if at this point
[02:03:04.260 --> 02:03:10.020]   If secretary clinton is elected she of course as the president will have a male
[02:03:10.020 --> 02:03:17.700]   First lady he'll be the first gentleman the complication is the first gentleman is also a former president
[02:03:18.020 --> 02:03:22.180]   Oh, he's mr. He remains he's mr. President except when then the presence of
[02:03:22.180 --> 02:03:24.980]   Madam president
[02:03:24.980 --> 02:03:28.900]   So at that point, I don't know what they call mr. Clinton, I guess
[02:03:28.900 --> 02:03:35.140]   Baba because she's madam president. You can't say you can't say mr. You can't call him. I'm told
[02:03:35.140 --> 02:03:38.420]   Right my wife who's a protocol whiz
[02:03:38.420 --> 02:03:42.980]   But apparently this is a whole thing the protocol experts is no president. That's me
[02:03:42.980 --> 02:03:46.180]   These are not the protocols. I know so he befagotis
[02:03:47.220 --> 02:03:49.220]   agotis abe fagotis

[02:09:53.540 --> 02:09:59.380]   That's so funny. I interviewed him. We just had him on the new screensavers. He's wonderful. He's so wonderful
[02:09:59.380 --> 02:10:03.620]   It's a great cook. Yeah, that was a great episode. He was our guest in the new screensavers
[02:10:03.620 --> 02:10:08.020]   He's just uh over in Berkeley. You know he works at google. Oh, no, his wife works at google
[02:10:08.020 --> 02:10:10.980]   His wife is a googler
[02:10:10.980 --> 02:10:13.780]   I did I can see
[02:10:13.780 --> 02:10:17.860]   More spatch cocking. You know what? I can't load your if this than that. I think uh, okay
[02:10:17.860 --> 02:10:19.300]   I think they've per-
[02:10:19.300 --> 02:10:23.940]   So how do you know that you're near if you've wondered how do you know you're near to the grocery store
[02:10:23.940 --> 02:10:26.980]   How do you let your your your husband?
[02:10:26.980 --> 02:10:31.220]   Know that you're near to the grocery store and ask if you need something
[02:10:31.220 --> 02:10:36.180]   So you I used you if you have an iOS you're gonna have to use that iOS
[02:10:36.180 --> 02:10:41.940]   Applets, but I use the android one so it's gps on my android or gps on your ios
[02:10:41.940 --> 02:10:44.420]   Okay, you put the
[02:10:44.420 --> 02:10:49.620]   Address of your oh just do an address. Okay. So you do it asks you for the address of your grocery store
[02:10:49.620 --> 02:10:53.380]   Or where it doesn't have to be a grocery store wherever you shop
[02:10:53.380 --> 02:10:54.180]   Yeah
[02:10:54.180 --> 02:10:58.340]   And then it asks you who you want to text and then you create it and there you go
[02:10:58.340 --> 02:11:03.860]   I I've been trying to get my husband to load this yes, but he won't because he knows i'm gonna be like yes
[02:11:03.860 --> 02:11:06.580]   I'm near a grocery store. Do you need something stacy?
[02:11:06.580 --> 02:11:11.300]   Uh about 24 things. I'm just about to send you a printout via fax
[02:11:12.020 --> 02:11:14.020]   Like link to our evernote
[02:11:14.020 --> 02:11:20.100]   That's what we use a google keep for our grocery list because you can share a list. Oh, right very handy
[02:11:20.100 --> 02:11:24.580]   Very handy. We used to have a device that we could talk to and it would take
[02:11:24.580 --> 02:11:30.020]   That device that was terrible that device was horrible. It was not the best device
[02:11:30.020 --> 02:11:33.220]   It got better
[02:11:33.220 --> 02:11:37.780]   I can't remember the name of it. I had that too. That was all that you are a gadget hat if you had that thing
[02:11:38.420 --> 02:11:42.340]   Jeff Jarvis your number of the week. Oh, oh, oh, I didn't like any of my numbers
[02:11:42.340 --> 02:11:45.060]   So I'll just uh, I put a lot of them in there by the way
[02:11:45.060 --> 02:11:47.460]   So great fail whale on if this than that look at this
[02:11:47.460 --> 02:11:50.180]   It's not it wouldn't load for me
[02:11:50.180 --> 02:11:52.420]   All the letters have fallen have fallen over
[02:11:52.420 --> 02:11:55.220]   That's perfect. Yeah
[02:11:55.220 --> 02:11:59.620]   Okay, your number of the week so facebook on all these wonderful numbers
[02:11:59.620 --> 02:12:05.220]   We that were left before huge amounts of revenue. Yeah, uh stock down 8% why what one
[02:12:05.940 --> 02:12:12.020]   uh, they they they said well, you know, we kind of crammed every hat we can in there for a while but two
[02:12:12.020 --> 02:12:14.740]   aggressive spending ahead
[02:12:14.740 --> 02:12:16.820]   Hmm
[02:12:16.820 --> 02:12:22.340]   That seems an opportunity to me if facebook stock dropped because they had the mine an incredible quarter
[02:12:22.340 --> 02:12:28.100]   Holy cow, it's because of the as often the case the advisement you sell yeah, but it's also the
[02:12:28.100 --> 02:12:33.940]   The incredible spending so you wonder what their say what their signaling is there they got big plans. They're doing more good things
[02:12:34.020 --> 02:12:37.620]   I want them to spend um who knows what it'll be but internet
[02:12:37.620 --> 02:12:40.100]   Oculus
[02:12:40.100 --> 02:12:42.740]   Yeah, it's it's VR it could be internet.org
[02:12:42.740 --> 02:12:45.460]   Uh, you know if they're going to grow
[02:12:45.460 --> 02:12:48.420]   To that exact point they need to get more people online
[02:12:48.420 --> 02:12:51.220]   Number of projects on the data center front
[02:12:51.220 --> 02:12:56.500]   Yeah, that too. They've they've got to have more data centers. They've got to add more capacity there
[02:12:56.500 --> 02:12:59.540]   I know it feel like they ever are slow, but
[02:13:00.100 --> 02:13:07.460]   Obviously it's keeping up. No, no, not but like yes keeping up with pro and yeah, especially if you start thinking about VR anyway
[02:13:07.460 --> 02:13:10.500]   My tip of the week is very simple
[02:13:10.500 --> 02:13:18.180]   For years we've told you you need to get a password manager. It's really a key to security and everybody says so is having good long strong passwords
[02:13:18.180 --> 02:13:24.020]   Problem is the best passwords are the hardest to remember so a password vault is great. You keep all your passwords in there
[02:13:24.020 --> 02:13:25.860]   You let it generate new ones for you
[02:13:25.860 --> 02:13:32.340]   You remember but one password the password that unlocks your vault the one we use and as Steve Gibson's vetted
[02:13:32.340 --> 02:13:34.260]   We've talked to joe seagris the creator of
[02:13:34.260 --> 02:13:40.820]   On our shows and really believe in and recommend and even use business wide that we use the enterprise version is last pass
[02:13:40.820 --> 02:13:46.900]   Very good news today last pass has gone free for one of its key premium features
[02:13:46.900 --> 02:13:49.860]   They still have a dollar a month premium subscription, which i'm going to continue
[02:13:49.860 --> 02:13:52.420]   But in the past if you wanted last pass to work
[02:13:52.980 --> 02:13:59.140]   On your phone as well as your desktop you had to pay that is now part of the free last pass
[02:13:59.140 --> 02:14:04.260]   So there are really for most people the free last pass is everything you need
[02:14:04.260 --> 02:14:09.220]   It does everything you want and it is a must-have you get
[02:14:09.220 --> 02:14:12.660]   Cross-platform access which is now free
[02:14:12.660 --> 02:14:18.340]   You can save passwords. It'll fill passwords in on and right. It does a beautiful job works in ios somewhat
[02:14:18.340 --> 02:14:22.740]   Generates passwords works in all browsers very nicely secure notes
[02:14:23.300 --> 02:14:25.300]   You can share passwords and notes
[02:14:25.300 --> 02:14:27.940]   Which i do with of course with my family
[02:14:27.940 --> 02:14:30.260]   Which is very handy
[02:14:30.260 --> 02:14:32.260]   It supports two factor
[02:14:32.260 --> 02:14:38.340]   And then there's a few extra things including family sharing and additional two-factor options if you pay the dollar a month
[02:14:38.340 --> 02:14:40.180]   I pay the dollar a month just because I want to keep them around
[02:14:40.180 --> 02:14:42.980]   And we also have the enterprise edition
[02:14:42.980 --> 02:14:45.380]   Everybody in the company has access to that
[02:14:45.380 --> 02:14:48.180]   And we've give free last pass to everybody in the company
[02:14:48.180 --> 02:14:50.740]   Because do you have does it offer
[02:14:51.220 --> 02:14:55.860]   This is a it's kind of a weird use case, but I have my passwords
[02:14:55.860 --> 02:15:00.260]   But then I also have our thing passwords for like the apps that my husband wants to know too
[02:15:00.260 --> 02:15:02.500]   Is there a way to bifurcate that?
[02:15:02.500 --> 02:15:05.940]   Yeah, you can be like each of you should have an account and you can share
[02:15:05.940 --> 02:15:09.140]   The passwords that you both need
[02:15:09.140 --> 02:15:10.340]   Okay
[02:15:10.340 --> 02:15:13.860]   That's what we do you we have exactly that situation where I don't he does
[02:15:13.860 --> 02:15:19.140]   Lisa doesn't need all my passwords, but she needs passwords to some of the critical stuff like you know
[02:15:19.780 --> 02:15:22.740]   Internet of things devices stuff like that. So I just share those with her
[02:15:22.740 --> 02:15:26.340]   Okay, and yes, that's built in and that's part of the free service
[02:15:26.340 --> 02:15:31.380]   The family sharing is for up to five users. So if you want to share to more than just your husband
[02:15:31.380 --> 02:15:37.300]   But your daughter's too young to give any passwords to it. Oh, I am not giving her any more control than what she has already
[02:15:37.300 --> 02:15:41.140]   Good lord. She already can stop her little feet and saying no mommy. No
[02:15:41.140 --> 02:15:46.100]   Stacy egg and bathroom stacey on iot.com. She has a great podcast
