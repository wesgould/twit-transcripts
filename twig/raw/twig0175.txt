[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   It's time for Twig this week and Google Jeff and Gina are here.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.640]   We're going to talk about what's going on in Dubai with the International Telecommunications
[00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.120]   Union and their closed-door meeting.
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.120]   What's going on?
[00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.400]   We're also going to talk about the EU and the US Department of Justice.
[00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.960]   Will they sue Google for any trust violations?
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:26.480]   All that and our tips of the week and the Google change log all ahead next on Twig.

[00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.640]   we damn well please.
[00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.640]   That's because we got the two best hosts anywhere.
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.960]   They know everything and so we just let them go.
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.200]   And that's of course Gina, I almost call her Jeff Tripani.
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.680]   Gina Tripani and Jeff Jarvis.
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.160]   Gina Tripani is the founding editor of Life Hacker.
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:13.120]   And of course ever since I started reading Life Hacker everything, how could I get Gina
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.280]   Tripani to do a show with us?
[00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.480]   And we're thrilled now here we are at episode 174 of Twig.
[00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:29.440]   She also writes ThinkUp at ThinkUp.com and todo.text and just wrote an article, very
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.640]   interesting article for Marco Armit's The Magazine.
[00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.000]   Yeah, I've had many publishing.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.800]   It's kind of a Life Hacker article, how to make a baby.
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.800]   Yeah, it went straight for the Life Hacker tutorial.
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.200]   It's the whole makers and we've been hearing about Gina.
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.200]   It's the ultimate.
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.880]   It's the ultimate of the maker culture.
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:52.680]   Someone said your title makes it sound as if the regular way to make a baby doesn't count.
[00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.880]   Let's just say it's the unconventional way to make a baby.
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.480]   Everyone knows how and this is good.
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:58.480]   This is good.
[00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.040]   It's showing important vital information.
[00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.200]   Also Jeff Jarvis who shares his public parts with us at all times.
[00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.840]   That's the name of his book, Public Parts.
[00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:10.680]   He's a professor of journalism at the City University of New York.
[00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.120]   And also another guy that I just thought if there were any way I could do a show with
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.120]   this guy it would be so good and boy did I have to two of you on a single show is marvelous.
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.120]   Marvelous calling.
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.960]   Actually an old friend of yours, Gina, is going to be on triangulation later today.
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:27.960]   We got Harper Reed.
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.800]   Oh, Harper's great.
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:30.800]   That's going to be a good interview.
[00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.680]   And you guys have great hair and glasses and easy t-shirts.
[00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.680]   Both of us have played werewolf with him at food camp.
[00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:46.640]   And the reason I wanted to get him on is because he had the team that did the software for
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:52.640]   Obama that worked compared to the software for Romney that didn't work both the same thing,
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:53.640]   right?
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.600]   Yeah, he was a CTO for Obama for America.
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:56.600]   Yeah.
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.040]   And before that he was CTO at Threadless.
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.480]   Yes, the t-shirt company.
[00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:02.480]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.040]   I was in a werewolf game with him and Ben Hove of I Can Has Teasper.
[00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.040]   It was like two in the morning.
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.040]   It was there.
[00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.960]   It was it was it was it was I there because I remember that.
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.480]   I think I was there, Gina.
[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:14.480]   You may have been there.
[00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:15.480]   I think I was there.
[00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.480]   It was a memorable werewolf game.
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:18.720]   I was like, wow.
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.120]   That was wow is right.
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:21.120]   The screaming, the yelling.
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:24.480]   Yeah, it was a lot of screaming and yelling.
[00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:27.480]   Ben Hove was a little, uh, inebriated.
[00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.000]   It was fabulous.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.640]   Uh, anyway, yeah, he, uh, there's a great article about him, uh, in the Atlantic.
[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:36.640]   There is Harper.
[00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:41.960]   Um, and, and you know, they, I can't remember what their pro, their program was called,
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:47.840]   one was called Narwhal and one, I can't remember, but, uh, the, uh, the, the, the,
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:52.480]   the Romney program was, was written, was named something that eats narwhals.
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.040]   I think it was or something like that.
[00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:55.760]   Anyway, we'll get the story.
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.800]   But, but, and it's interesting.
[00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.240]   Um, Romney's on an election day crashed and didn't work.
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:02.240]   Yeah.
[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.400]   Obama had narwhal and then Orca was, that's right.
[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.960]   The Republicans was called Orca because Orca's eaten our walls.
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:12.040]   In this case didn't, didn't quite work out because, uh, I think mostly due to testing.
[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:17.480]   It's fast, it's a fascinating example of the stuff that we're into, the geekery, uh, that
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:22.680]   we understand, you know, you don't put a website live without testing it under extreme conditions
[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:23.680]   first.
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:28.320]   Uh, and we all know that, but I guess somebody, uh, somebody at the Republican National Committee
[00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:33.320]   did not early in the campaign, Harper handed me a button, a pen that said, get branch
[00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:34.320]   for Obama.
[00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:35.320]   And I thought, okay.
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:36.320]   Get it.
[00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:37.320]   It's a good sign.
[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:41.320]   The tech, the tech at OFA is going to be good.
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.720]   Get branch for Obama.
[00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:44.720]   Wow.
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:45.720]   Yeah.
[00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:46.720]   Wow.
[00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.480]   He had a really cool team of nerds there.
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:49.480]   That's going to be a good interview later.
[00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:50.480]   Yeah, I'm very excited.
[00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:54.480]   Anyway, I thought I'd mention that because I know you're, you're a fan.
[00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:57.480]   At least we like his werewolf skills.
[00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:58.480]   Technique for sure.
[00:05:58.480 --> 00:05:59.480]   Excellent technique.
[00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:00.480]   Wow.
[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.480]   Google IO.
[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.360]   It's coming, baby.
[00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:11.160]   Or as make it this time as the geek world calls it Oprah for a group for nerds.
[00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.600]   Back to Bay this year.
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.400]   Last year was June, right?
[00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.960]   May 15 through 17th.
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.440]   Mm hmm.
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:25.720]   And end up probably have something under your seat metaphorically by then we may have Google
[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:26.720]   Glass.
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:30.960]   We might have the touch screen Chromebook.
[00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:31.960]   Yeah.
[00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:33.640]   What do you please explain?
[00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:37.560]   I mean, we talked about this last week and then I get on Twitter and I forgot to mention
[00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:38.560]   this on Twitter.
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:40.920]   But there's no Chrome OS doesn't have touch.
[00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:41.920]   Does it?
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:42.920]   No, it doesn't.
[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:47.840]   Maybe this rumor is confusing Chrome OS with Android.
[00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:51.720]   I, this is going to be named dropping here, but I was in a meeting yesterday with Klaus
[00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:55.240]   Schwab, who's the head of the Davos World Economic Forum and I showed him the Chromebook.
[00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:56.240]   That's obnoxious.
[00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:57.240]   I am now.
[00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:58.240]   Oh boy.
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:59.240]   It's important.
[00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:00.240]   You must see this, right?
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:01.240]   What do you do?
[00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:02.240]   What?
[00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:03.240]   First thing he wants to do is touch it.
[00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:04.240]   Touch it.
[00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:05.240]   Yeah.
[00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:06.240]   I agree.
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:07.240]   So I think you just have to now.
[00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:08.240]   That's my laptop screen in a moment.
[00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:09.240]   Not thinking.
[00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.240]   Have you guys done this?
[00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:14.000]   Every time I do it daily because I one thing where Microsoft Microsoft is ahead to have
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.520]   a touchscreen laptop, you know, given points.
[00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:20.760]   Apple should have been touchscreen ages ago.
[00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:25.040]   But one thing we do know for sure is you can't graph touch onto an existing OS.
[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:27.240]   That's what Microsoft did wrong for 10 years.
[00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:28.240]   Right.
[00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:29.240]   That's true.
[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.240]   I'm very curious.
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:32.600]   Now remember, this is like a digit times rumor.
[00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:34.360]   This is like out of China.
[00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:36.280]   So that Google is going to do a Chrome.
[00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:37.440]   It'd be wrong.
[00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:42.680]   But you know, we use browsers on our phones and tablets and we use them touch.
[00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:46.240]   So a browser and touch is not incompatible.
[00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:50.880]   So how is, you know, we should explain and we also mentioned you on Twitter this week
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:52.400]   because you're the only person.
[00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:53.400]   I'm on the front of me.
[00:07:53.400 --> 00:07:54.400]   Yeah, a little bit.
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:56.560]   Well, we just said this is a real journalist.
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:08:02.120]   The only person we know who would even consider abandoning everything but Google products.
[00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:03.920]   You're not using Windows OS 10.
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:07.560]   You're using a Chromebook, the new Samsung Chromebook, which is.
[00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:09.440]   I will use.
[00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:10.920]   I have to use Skype for you guys.
[00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:12.440]   We're going to tell we're going to test Google.
[00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:16.920]   I do use the Chrome browser on my office laptop, but I only live in Chrome.
[00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:17.920]   I won't.
[00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:18.920]   I won't do any Microsoft applications for the house.
[00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:20.320]   I live within Chrome.
[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:21.960]   And how's Epic going for you?
[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:25.720]   It's been going well today was the first time I flew down to Palm Beach where I am now.
[00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:27.400]   See the hotel room.
[00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:29.960]   And to Lexus, Nexus.
[00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:30.960]   To Lexus, Nexus.
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:33.520]   That's why I'm in bad hotel lighting and that's why I'm so pink.
[00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:34.520]   You're at a four seasons.
[00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:35.520]   Don't complain.
[00:08:35.520 --> 00:08:37.520]   I don't want to hear any complaints.
[00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:38.520]   Or sirets.
[00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:43.280]   I had the first airplane ride and it is challenging.
[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:47.920]   You forget that you've got to set up a mail and docs for offline use.
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:51.800]   I plan on to be on the plane and use a certain PowerPoint that I was going to present down
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:52.800]   here.
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:53.800]   I had had it in docs.
[00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:55.320]   It didn't show up in the docs.
[00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:57.760]   My calendar I couldn't go to.
[00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:00.240]   One very irritating thing about the Chromebook.
[00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:05.000]   And I don't understand architecturally why this happens is that it insists on refreshing
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.120]   web pages all the time.
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:10.040]   So even though that's right, or Chrome browser, right?
[00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:11.280]   I'll just have the mail.
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:13.280]   It sits there until I choose to refresh it.
[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:17.520]   I go to the Chromebook and I got to wait because it's not a very fast thing.
[00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:18.520]   It's got to refresh the mail.
[00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:20.320]   It's got to refresh this, refresh that.
[00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:24.360]   Well, when you're on the plane, it'll immediately say you're offline.
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:25.360]   You can have this page.
[00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:27.160]   And then it'll say you can try if you want to.
[00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:28.160]   And you do.
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:30.280]   And it's in the cache and it gives you the page.
[00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:33.520]   So it's not super smooth.
[00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:36.000]   Here's the big lesson thus far.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.680]   I got to write up this post.
[00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:42.200]   But now that I'm the biggest, biggest lesson thus far, I was in my entrepreneurial class.
[00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:45.160]   Our students are giving their grassroots for their final presentations.
[00:09:45.160 --> 00:09:47.200]   I'm making my notes by Cret.
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:49.800]   On every note, as a Chrome app.
[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:51.640]   OK, everything's going fine.
[00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:53.680]   We're four hours into this.
[00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:54.680]   Four hours.
[00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:58.480]   Suddenly, the browser page forever note refreshes on its own.
[00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:00.200]   And I don't think it's the browser's fault.
[00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:01.360]   In this case, maybe everything's fault.
[00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:02.600]   I don't know.
[00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:05.120]   And all but the first 20 minutes of notes are gone.
[00:10:05.120 --> 00:10:06.120]   Oh, oh.
[00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:07.600]   That's not good.
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:08.600]   Not good.
[00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:12.800]   And the bottom line here is they don't support Chrome OS.
[00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:14.400]   So it does not store locally.
[00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:17.480]   So lesson for living in cloud.
[00:10:17.480 --> 00:10:21.080]   We need to do things that number one, store redundantly, locally.
[00:10:21.080 --> 00:10:27.680]   And number two, that are in a format that you can get to otherwise.
[00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:31.600]   So Google Docs, you can make into a Word document or whatever the heck you want.
[00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:32.960]   Ever note, not so much.
[00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:35.680]   And ever note tried, and they were helpful, but there's nothing they could do.
[00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:38.280]   It was just gone.
[00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:43.400]   So web 491, Sittinart-Jarrum basically, you've created a laptop.
[00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:44.400]   Yes.
[00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:45.400]   True.
[00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:46.400]   True.
[00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:47.920]   And you have local storage.
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:49.720]   You've got to have local storage.
[00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:50.720]   You've got to have local storage.
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:51.720]   Yeah.
[00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:52.720]   You've got to run the storage.
[00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:53.720]   And local is what makes sense.
[00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:54.720]   But you're saying that Google hasn't solved this.
[00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:55.720]   The Chromebook has not solved this.
[00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:56.720]   You have to do it yourself.
[00:10:56.720 --> 00:10:57.720]   It solves it for its own apps.
[00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:59.560]   It's solved beautifully for mail.
[00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:00.560]   Google Docs.
[00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:01.560]   Yeah, mail.
[00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:02.560]   Google Docs and all that.
[00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:03.560]   It's fine.
[00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:04.560]   And it stores locally.
[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:05.560]   And it keeps going.
[00:11:05.560 --> 00:11:06.560]   And that's fine.
[00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:10.480]   But ever note, because it does not have a Chrome OS native app, it's just basically a
[00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:11.480]   link.
[00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:12.880]   I think that it's an ever note app.
[00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:13.880]   It's not.
[00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:16.280]   It's a link to the web app.
[00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:20.480]   And if you're on Mac or Windows, you can download the Chrome--
[00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:26.360]   I mean, the ever note app and then store locally in ever note format.
[00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:28.960]   It's funny, because I'm so dependent on ever note too.
[00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:30.840]   That would be a deal breaker for me.
[00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:31.840]   It is.
[00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:35.000]   The main thing I miss is so I'll make notes for as long as this experiment goes on.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.160]   I'll make them in Google Docs because they more come.
[00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:39.120]   Oh, that's what they want, obviously, right?
[00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:42.840]   But it doesn't have neat things like tags.
[00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:44.160]   Ever note house.
[00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:47.200]   So those are the first two real problems I've had.
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:50.600]   Otherwise, my problem was that I was going to write this big post about what I was like
[00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:51.760]   to live in the Google world.
[00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:53.000]   And I had nothing to say.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   Don't make deals.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   It's just like anything else.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.800]   Yeah, it was the big.
[00:11:56.800 --> 00:12:01.440]   Gina, is there a mechanism in HTML5 for some sort of local storage?
[00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:02.440]   There is.
[00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:03.440]   There is.
[00:12:03.440 --> 00:12:05.440]   But Jeff said that ever note doesn't support--
[00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:06.440]   But they could.
[00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:07.440]   But it could, right.
[00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:10.000]   That's how Docs and Gmail works offline.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:15.120]   So that's not as it used to be an add-on.
[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:17.120]   But in fact, it's just pure HTML5.
[00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:18.920]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:25.760]   But there's something very comforting to me about local storage, traditional local storage
[00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:28.800]   meeting like my file system that I can browse through.
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:32.160]   Ever know and Dropbox.
[00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:33.840]   And even-- I'm even crazy.
[00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:37.160]   I work exclusively just in Gmail in the web browser.
[00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:39.400]   But every month, I am total nerd.
[00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:39.920]   I know.
[00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:42.840]   But I have this calendar reminder that's like download your Gmail.
[00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:43.840]   You know, I map it.
[00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:44.840]   Oh, wow.
[00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:49.600]   Actually, I pop and I map my Gmail just because I just like the idea that I have a copy, a
[00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:51.600]   text copy of my email on my hard drive.
[00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:54.520]   So if Google went away, if I was disconnected, I could search through my email.
[00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:55.760]   There's just something comforting about that.
[00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:59.520]   Even though I know that I can lose my laptop or it gets stolen or like the likelihood that
[00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:03.680]   my hard drive is going to fry is a lot higher than Google's.
[00:13:03.680 --> 00:13:06.480]   And yeah, HTML5 has local storage.
[00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:08.600]   But I like I'm a nerd.
[00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:09.600]   I like redundancy.
[00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:13.560]   I just like the idea that things are sort of propagating across all my devices kind of
[00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:15.640]   in the traditional way.
[00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:21.400]   Like, Jeff, I feel your pain losing three and a half hours of note taking.
[00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:24.000]   That just would have slayed me.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:27.320]   And it doesn't help when you're my age and you have a bad memory.
[00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:30.280]   You can't recreate it.
[00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:33.040]   So how did that happen again?
[00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:37.680]   It was weird, the Evernote page just suddenly on its own.
[00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:43.920]   What will happen is if I go back up here so I get it right, if I'm on a different tab
[00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:49.880]   and then I go to my Gmail tab, at that moment, it decides it will refresh the page even though
[00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:52.240]   I know there's no new mail since I'm just trying to see something.
[00:13:52.240 --> 00:13:56.520]   And I have to wait 10 seconds for it to do it and I curse and that's that.
[00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:57.520]   That's not what happened in this case.
[00:13:57.520 --> 00:13:58.520]   I was on the Evernote page.
[00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:00.880]   I was taking notes and suddenly on its own, it just boom.
[00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:02.760]   It decided to refresh.
[00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:09.480]   It disappeared and when it came back, it came back having lost three hours.
[00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:15.080]   And then at Piedon, people said in class they said, "Go to history."
[00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:18.160]   And I tried and said, "No history because I didn't have the premium."
[00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:19.720]   So I immediately paid the premium.
[00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:22.360]   Hopefully it would be there, but of course it wasn't there then.
[00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:25.880]   Oh, do you think if you had a premium account, it wouldn't have happened?
[00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:26.880]   I don't know.
[00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:28.520]   The question is, it says that it saves occasionally.
[00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:30.720]   You don't know when it's saving.
[00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:31.720]   That's the problem.
[00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:35.040]   That's the problem too, whereas Google Docs is telling you, "I've just saved it."
[00:14:35.040 --> 00:14:36.040]   All right.
[00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:37.040]   Save them.
[00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:43.120]   It's an implementation issue, but nevertheless, it underscores the hazard of living the cloud.
[00:14:43.120 --> 00:14:44.320]   You cannot live fully in the cloud.
[00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:46.920]   You still need a foot on the ground.
[00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:49.720]   I think third-party apps really have to catch up to Google's level.
[00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:54.680]   I mean, I would actually feel really comfortable using Google apps in the cloud entirely.
[00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:58.040]   Drive and Gmail and counter, all that stuff I would feel good about.
[00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:01.840]   But I think third-party apps just need to play catch up with that the same sort of
[00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:07.480]   great level of auto-saving and local HTML5 storage and syncing because that's relatively
[00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:08.560]   new.
[00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:10.280]   I think that you're a little old-fashioned.
[00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:14.360]   I think in the long run, if this is implemented properly, you shouldn't ever have to think
[00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:17.000]   about a file system or storage or backup.
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   That's exactly right.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   Yeah.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   That's the point, right?
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:22.560]   And automated storage redundancy.
[00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:25.760]   Because part of it is because people don't do the right thing.
[00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:27.960]   You know how to do the right thing, but most people do not.
[00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:28.960]   It's just out.
[00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:29.960]   It's just out.
[00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:37.920]   So the best solution is to do it all automatically, transparently using HTML5 and whatever technologies
[00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:38.920]   you need.
[00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:41.560]   I wasn't around Sunday afternoon to watch the show, which I do try to do.
[00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:43.760]   So who made fun of me?
[00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:44.760]   Mike Elton.
[00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:46.960]   Nobody made fun of you.
[00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:49.120]   No, we were just amazed.
[00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:50.600]   Mike, you know, is a Google plug.
[00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:51.600]   Mike lives in Google.
[00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:52.600]   Mike is Google.
[00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:53.600]   He's a huge Google plus guy.
[00:15:53.600 --> 00:15:54.600]   Is he a huge Google plus guy?
[00:15:54.600 --> 00:15:55.600]   Am I an out-looking delegate?
[00:15:55.600 --> 00:15:56.600]   Pardon me?
[00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:58.600]   Have I out-miced Elton?
[00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:00.200]   Have I out-done him?
[00:16:00.200 --> 00:16:02.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.760]   I don't think he would use a Chromebook only.
[00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:07.480]   He's all about Google plus, right?
[00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:08.480]   But he's not quite--
[00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:09.480]   He's not crazy.
[00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:12.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:13.840]   He's in Nairobi, Kenya.
[00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:14.840]   Now he is a little crazy.
[00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:17.400]   You know what Mike has done, which is I so admire.
[00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:19.840]   He's decided I don't need to be any particular place.
[00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:21.680]   So he and his wife went to Greece for a while.
[00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:23.360]   Now they're in Nairobi.
[00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:25.080]   There's nothing pulled them there.
[00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:26.320]   Just nothing held them here.
[00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:27.320]   Right.
[00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:29.160]   So they just travel around.
[00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:30.600]   I thought I'd missed a chapter of a story.
[00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:31.600]   I could tell why.
[00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:34.280]   No, he just said-- you know, well, he said this on Twitter.
[00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:36.200]   He said, the kids are grown and out of the house.
[00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:38.240]   There's this window before they have grandkids
[00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:40.920]   when we'll probably want to be back in the US for us
[00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:42.440]   just to be travel.
[00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:43.720]   So for the next few years--
[00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:46.840]   It's a lot cheaper than Nairobi's sheep.
[00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:49.640]   There was a cover of Money Magazine--
[00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:51.000]   God, you know, 30 years ago.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.560]   My hero is the horse.
[00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:53.760]   I remember their name.
[00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:57.160]   And they said it costs money to earn money.
[00:16:57.160 --> 00:16:58.360]   You got to have cars, suits.
[00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:00.400]   We lived near work and all this kind of stuff.
[00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:03.600]   And they had, I think, the grand sum of $500,000 of time.
[00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:04.880]   And they looked where in the world
[00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:06.840]   that they could live best on dollars.
[00:17:06.840 --> 00:17:08.600]   And at the time, it was Argentina,
[00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:10.800]   because there was huge inflation in Argentina.
[00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:11.760]   So they could live best.
[00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:12.720]   And they were this whole story.
[00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:14.280]   I always wonder what happened to them.
[00:17:14.280 --> 00:17:15.160]   And they just lived there.
[00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:16.920]   And they always-- they traveled around the world.
[00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:19.280]   And they lived beautifully.
[00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:20.120]   So that was a great way.
[00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:22.000]   They came and called your horse.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.120]   Oh, no, you found them?
[00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:25.560]   Yeah, unfortunately, their page is on GeoCities.
[00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:27.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:28.400]   I wasn't supposed to.
[00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:32.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:35.440]   So that's gone.
[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:35.800]   But I did.
[00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:38.440]   I found them.
[00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:40.520]   That was their home page.
[00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:43.160]   Cashing in on the American dream.
[00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:44.600]   Wow, it sort of really is that boat.
[00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:45.600]   Yeah.
[00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:48.400]   Oh.
[00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:49.400]   Very interesting.
[00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:51.640]   Yeah, Vicki and Paul, they're hoarse.
[00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:53.520]   I don't know if they're still traveling or not.
[00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:56.640]   As of 2009, they were.
[00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:58.080]   I have always wanted to do that.
[00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:05.120]   Gina, you're not doing it for 20 years.
[00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:07.840]   Yeah, I'm grounded for a little bit.
[00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:10.160]   Yeah, Susie, you have kids who are out of luck.
[00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:11.440]   I'll pass for--
[00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:15.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:18.560]   23 years ago, they retired at the age of 35.
[00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:20.560]   They live as of 2007.
[00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:23.120]   They were in Poocett, Thailand.
[00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:24.920]   They are strolling the beach.
[00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:26.240]   Is that OK?
[00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:26.760]   Yeah.
[00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:31.480]   I don't know.
[00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:33.480]   I like living in America.
[00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:34.200]   I do too.
[00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:35.840]   I like living in California.
[00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:37.480]   I mean, you've got to be crazy living in California.
[00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:41.280]   We almost have 10% state income taps on top of.
[00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:43.840]   I mean, you've got to be so expensive to live here.
[00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:46.240]   But I can't imagine living anywhere else.
[00:18:46.280 --> 00:18:53.360]   So they live on $50 a day.
[00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:55.840]   I'm sorry, we got distracted.
[00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:57.040]   Meanwhile, Google Ventures--
[00:18:57.040 --> 00:19:01.720]   Speaking of such, Corey Booker, mayor of Newark,
[00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:04.480]   is this week living on just food stamps because of a Twitter
[00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:05.160]   challenge to him.
[00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:05.680]   I saw that.
[00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:07.000]   I love him.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:08.520]   Is he not the greatest--
[00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:08.960]   He's right.
[00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:12.400]   During Sandy, my wife made me follow him on Twitter
[00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:14.040]   and he was magnificent.
[00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:14.520]   Just make this.
[00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:16.920]   Now, full disclosure is an advisor to his company Waywire.
[00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:18.440]   So I haven't met him yet.
[00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:19.600]   Well, like I said, it years ago.
[00:19:19.600 --> 00:19:21.800]   Corey Booker has a company called Waywire.
[00:19:21.800 --> 00:19:23.600]   Yes, Waywire, a very interesting company
[00:19:23.600 --> 00:19:26.080]   that believes that a video is going
[00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:28.520]   to be the best way to reach news and literacy
[00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:29.560]   with young people.
[00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:30.600]   And so it's right.
[00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:33.720]   Company, so it's in beta right now.
[00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:35.120]   And--
[00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:37.080]   It's actually hashtag Waywire.
[00:19:37.080 --> 00:19:37.440]   Yes.
[00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:40.800]   You make wires of videos that you were recommending.
[00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:42.760]   And then you can make videos as well, all kinds of things.
[00:19:42.760 --> 00:19:44.840]   So they're just starting it up, but it's really very interesting.
[00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:46.480]   Actually, this is the second company
[00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:48.560]   this week I've heard of where they're a hashtag.
[00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:50.520]   The name starts with--
[00:19:50.520 --> 00:19:51.840]   This is the new thing, right?
[00:19:51.840 --> 00:19:52.840]   Yeah.
[00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:54.560]   You missed the boat because there was a baby named
[00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:55.680]   hashtag this last time.
[00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:56.840]   That's right.
[00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:57.680]   I heard that.
[00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:00.440]   Hashtag Etta.
[00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:01.480]   Hashtag Etta, that might be it.
[00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:03.200]   That's a good one.
[00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:05.240]   Hashtags are at this point--
[00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:08.480]   well, we were talking about Abby and the fact that she--
[00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:12.640]   and actually Abby's my daughter and her brother, my son.
[00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:14.520]   Henry, both used--
[00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:16.440]   I made that more complicated than it really is.
[00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:17.920]   Well, she didn't ask how to have a baby,
[00:20:17.920 --> 00:20:19.560]   and then you had to explain families to her.
[00:20:19.560 --> 00:20:23.360]   My kids, Abby and Henry, both use Instagram like crazy.
[00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:26.200]   They just discovered it like they're posting all the time.
[00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:28.680]   And when Abby posts, she just posts in hashtags.
[00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:29.640]   She says, very few--
[00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:31.360]   it's even like the comments.
[00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:34.400]   Like she showed the Christmas tree and said, nice job mom.
[00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:35.920]   But she didn't do nice job mom.
[00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:38.760]   She did hashtag, nice job mom.
[00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:39.720]   Is that the new thing?
[00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:40.960]   Is that what the kids are doing?
[00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:43.280]   Seems like it.
[00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:45.040]   I'm so get off by lawn about that.
[00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:45.600]   Sorry, Abby.
[00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:46.800]   I've seen people do this on Twitter,
[00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:49.200]   and I'm just like, oh, sta--
[00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:50.880]   you just hashtag the correct way.
[00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:51.960]   Just type.
[00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:53.080]   I still want to file systems.
[00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:56.760]   I'm clearly old and gray.
[00:20:56.760 --> 00:21:00.560]   OK, get ready for this weird synchrony.
[00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:05.080]   Paul and Vicky Turhorst, their nephew
[00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:07.280]   is one of our chat moderators.
[00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:07.880]   No.
[00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:08.960]   Yes.
[00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:10.760]   Can we bowl, please?
[00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:13.200]   See, the wall world.
[00:21:13.200 --> 00:21:16.560]   That is weird, man.
[00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:17.800]   That's a long world.
[00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:20.480]   Well, nephew, tell them that they're my hero.
[00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:22.960]   Rich kids on Instagram.
[00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:24.440]   This is something Abby told me about, too.
[00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:27.240]   There's like a whole meme of rich kids.
[00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:28.640]   Oh, is that the pool?
[00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:29.840]   I was like--
[00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:32.400]   Yeah, like here's me draped across this amazing car.
[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:34.000]   So I got let me go get my Porsche.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:36.120]   Oh, we're out on this yacht.
[00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:40.640]   But my favorite, have you seen the college humor video?
[00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:42.520]   Mocking Instagram?
[00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:43.800]   No, I haven't seen it yet.
[00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:44.840]   I haven't seen that one.
[00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:46.320]   All right, I'll take a break when we come back.
[00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:49.000]   It's a parody of a Nickelback song.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.120]   And it is quite humorous.
[00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:53.560]   So we'll be playing that in a second.
[00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:58.160]   But first, let me talk about the No BS mobile phone service.
[00:21:58.160 --> 00:21:59.800]   Ting.
[00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:01.880]   The folks at 2KAS-- I love the 2KAS.
[00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:03.880]   They say, we're going to look for markets.
[00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:06.200]   They are ripe for fixing.
[00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:08.760]   They fix the domain registration market with Hover.
[00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:10.280]   And now they say, you know, there's release.
[00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:13.360]   Everybody hates their cell carrier, right?
[00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:15.520]   Everybody hates their cell carrier.
[00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:17.080]   So why don't we do a better job?
[00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:18.680]   And if you want to find out what they're doing,
[00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:24.240]   go to twig.ting, ting.com.
[00:22:24.240 --> 00:22:27.160]   They're an MV-- no, that means they're resale sprint service.
[00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:28.920]   So if you've got good sprint service where you are,
[00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:32.640]   this is US only, obviously, you can
[00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:35.520]   get the best cell phone service ever with Ting.
[00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:38.480]   No overage charges, no penalties, no bundling,
[00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:42.840]   no ride-alongs, no contracts, no early termination fees.
[00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:46.840]   You pay for what you use, no more, no less.
[00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:49.680]   When you sign up for a plan, it's really kind of more
[00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:51.760]   like a serving suggestion.
[00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:53.920]   You pick how-- it's $6 for phone.
[00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:56.000]   So this is great for a business or a family.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.400]   $6 a month per phone.
[00:22:58.400 --> 00:22:59.960]   10 phones, $60 a month.
[00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:00.920]   That's your base.
[00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:03.840]   Then you pick how many minutes you want shared--
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:05.360]   shared with those phones.
[00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:07.200]   How many text messages you want?
[00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:10.360]   How many gigabytes of data you want shared?
[00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:11.640]   It's always shared.
[00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:14.000]   But this is just like, I think I'm going to use this.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:14.960]   I'm going to pay for this.
[00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:17.120]   Because if you use less, they rebate it.
[00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:19.000]   They give you the money back.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:22.200]   If you use more, they just charge you
[00:23:22.200 --> 00:23:24.640]   what they would have charged for the next plan up.
[00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:26.200]   There's never a penalty.
[00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:28.560]   And it always includes tethering free--
[00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:32.160]   hotspot free-- caller ID, three-way calling, video messaging,
[00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:35.200]   picture, messaging, voicemail, all that stuff--
[00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:37.160]   free.
[00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:40.000]   If I got-- let me just--
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.880]   I said, let's do a family of four.
[00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:46.000]   Four phones, I want 2,000 minutes.
[00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.720]   That's a lot.
[00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:50.600]   I want to do-- let's do 1,000 text message.
[00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:51.400]   Well, all right.
[00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:52.320]   It's Abby and Henry.
[00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:55.800]   4,000 text messages and 3 gigabytes of data.
[00:23:55.800 --> 00:23:59.520]   All of that, $130 a month for the whole family.
[00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:02.600]   Compare that to your phone plan and then visit Ting.
[00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:05.960]   I want you to go to twig.ting.com.
[00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:09.280]   You'll save $50 on your first device.
[00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:12.640]   They have all the big name phones.
[00:24:12.640 --> 00:24:15.040]   It is really a great service.
[00:24:15.040 --> 00:24:15.680]   Here's how it works.
[00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:17.400]   You're going to purchase your mobile device from Ting.
[00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:19.560]   So look at their phones.
[00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:21.600]   You'll receive it in two to five business days.
[00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:22.600]   Then you activate it.
[00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:24.320]   And at that point, you'll select a new number
[00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:26.640]   or port your existing number.
[00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:28.400]   Select minutes, messages, and megabytes
[00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:29.520]   that just showed you.
[00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:31.720]   And again, it's just kind of like your best guess.
[00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:34.040]   Ting will bill you at the beginning of your payment period,
[00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:37.040]   but you'll be charged or credited in the following pay period
[00:24:37.040 --> 00:24:38.400]   based on what you actually used.
[00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:39.880]   You never pay more.
[00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:41.680]   No penalties, nothing.
[00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:45.160]   They've even got the Galaxy Note 2.
[00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:48.680]   Wow, actually, that's less than I paid to get it from Sprint.
[00:24:48.680 --> 00:24:51.160]   And you get the great Ting service, the S3.
[00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:55.760]   They've got all-- I mean, this is awesome.
[00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:58.880]   And $50 bucks off when you go twig.ting.com.
[00:24:58.880 --> 00:25:00.080]   I really love these guys.
[00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:01.880]   And I think you will, too.
[00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:03.880]   Ting.
[00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:06.720]   Yes, somebody's pointing out that now Facebook is using phone
[00:25:06.720 --> 00:25:06.960]   numbers.
[00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:08.880]   You don't have to have a Facebook account on their messaging
[00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:09.800]   app.
[00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:11.360]   Boy, I'd be scared if I were a phone
[00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:13.920]   company trying to make money on this at mess these days.
[00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:18.920]   The new Facebook messenger, well, you could do it to a phone.
[00:25:18.920 --> 00:25:20.800]   So you don't even have to pay for messaging.
[00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:22.560]   All right, here you go.
[00:25:22.560 --> 00:25:27.240]   Collegehumor.com-- this is a Nickelback parody.
[00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:32.880]   I wonder if we're going to get an ad here first.
[00:25:32.880 --> 00:25:34.020]   Yeah, just a little bit of an ad.
[00:25:34.020 --> 00:25:35.840]   No, here it is.
[00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:37.320]   Listen to this.
[00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:40.520]   Look at this Instagram.
[00:25:40.520 --> 00:25:43.760]   Expanded inside of him.
[00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:46.760]   This guy is a living tart.
[00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:50.400]   And my phone went and made it art.
[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:53.560]   And these are my fingernails.
[00:25:53.560 --> 00:25:56.680]   The bees and the details.
[00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:59.740]   Drinking my ties on the cruise.
[00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:03.580]   Just a coincidence is also booze.
[00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:06.460]   Everyone look at my feet.
[00:26:06.460 --> 00:26:09.700]   Get jealous out of my other beach.
[00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:12.780]   Probably who I was going there.
[00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:16.180]   You saw my plane swinging in the air.
[00:26:16.180 --> 00:26:22.780]   I would have city lights, dry seeing them in black and white.
[00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:26.020]   Putting glasses on a cat.
[00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:29.260]   I'm the first one to think of that.
[00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:31.740]   Oh, oh, oh.
[00:26:31.740 --> 00:26:34.180]   He thinks he's people.
[00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:37.700]   Every time I take a photo of an old toy.
[00:26:37.700 --> 00:26:39.940]   I've taken every one of these pictures, by the way.
[00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:42.300]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:26:42.300 --> 00:26:43.300]   Really?
[00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:45.300]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:47.140]   Little fun!
[00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:49.140]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:51.140]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:26:51.140 --> 00:27:05.580]   Ah, it's kind of a depressing song,
[00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:06.900]   because literally I swear to God,
[00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:08.300]   I've taken every one of those pictures,
[00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:09.300]   except for the fingernails.
[00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:10.940]   And my daughter does that.
[00:27:10.940 --> 00:27:16.900]   Coffee foam, pretentious tome, garden gnome.
[00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:18.940]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:20.540]   This would be a good game.
[00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:23.220]   How many-- like a Czech libingo, Instagram bingo.
[00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:23.980]   That's right.
[00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:24.820]   It's your bucket list.
[00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:25.340]   Yeah.
[00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:26.340]   Your Instagram bucket list.
[00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:29.060]   A super close up of my eye.
[00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:31.660]   Now a selfie, looking cute.
[00:27:31.660 --> 00:27:33.780]   In the same-- well, we'll go on with that later.
[00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:34.780]   You should watch the rest of it.
[00:27:34.780 --> 00:27:35.260]   It's fun.
[00:27:35.260 --> 00:27:36.660]   That's a great parody.
[00:27:36.660 --> 00:27:38.580]   It's pretty good.
[00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:44.300]   Yeah, when I was deciding where I was going to publish pictures of Etta,
[00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:46.460]   for a moment, I thought I was on Instagram.
[00:27:46.460 --> 00:27:48.060]   And I was just like, you know what?
[00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:50.380]   Pictures of her just too important.
[00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:52.740]   I wanted some privacy set.
[00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:56.420]   I don't want to cut them off at a weird aspect ratio
[00:27:56.420 --> 00:27:57.420]   and do some weird--
[00:27:57.420 --> 00:27:58.820]   I just-- you know.
[00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:00.300]   So you put them on Facebook?
[00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:01.100]   I do Flickr.
[00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:02.780]   Actually, I decided not to get Facebook.
[00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:03.940]   I put them on Flickr.
[00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:04.740]   Yeah, which is great.
[00:28:04.740 --> 00:28:07.620]   It's kind of charming the old fashioned of you.
[00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:08.700]   Flickr.
[00:28:08.700 --> 00:28:09.220]   This is so--
[00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:10.460]   What is that?
[00:28:10.460 --> 00:28:11.020]   No, I know.
[00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:11.540]   This is crazy.
[00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:13.220]   This is the old fashioned.
[00:28:13.220 --> 00:28:15.540]   It's great, because only people who are really looking
[00:28:15.540 --> 00:28:18.020]   for them see them, because really no one goes on Flickr anymore.
[00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:19.780]   Or in my community, not a lot of people
[00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:21.300]   go on Flickr anymore of their own accord.
[00:28:21.300 --> 00:28:21.900]   So--
[00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:23.900]   It's the ball right of our generation, yes.
[00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:25.500]   It is.
[00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:26.180]   Yeah.
[00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:27.660]   Yeah, it's very retro.
[00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:28.180]   It is.
[00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:30.100]   It is.
[00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:31.620]   Well, it's good, because you wouldn't
[00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:34.620]   be able to display those pictures properly on Twitter anymore
[00:28:34.620 --> 00:28:36.060]   if you put them on Instagram.
[00:28:36.060 --> 00:28:37.500]   This is a boy.
[00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:38.940]   This is amazing.
[00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:40.540]   So interesting.
[00:28:40.540 --> 00:28:44.300]   I don't know how much this has to do with Facebook.
[00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:46.060]   Of course, Instagram was purchased by Facebook.
[00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:47.660]   And Kevin Sistram, the founder of Instagram,
[00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:50.580]   has said repeatedly, we're not going to be Facebook.
[00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:53.060]   Facebook's going to let us be independent.
[00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:56.460]   But today, they disabled the ability for Twitter
[00:28:56.460 --> 00:28:58.340]   to display Instagram photos on the website.
[00:28:58.340 --> 00:29:01.900]   They basically turned off Twitter card integration.
[00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:06.980]   So remember now to recap if you're just joining us.
[00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:09.260]   Twitter has decided that they want everybody
[00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:10.500]   to go to the Twitter web page.
[00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:12.660]   And they want all the content on the page.
[00:29:12.660 --> 00:29:16.540]   And so they have this Twitter card API
[00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:20.020]   so that somebody like Instagram will actually
[00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:23.220]   have the photo in the tweet on the Twitter web page.
[00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:27.340]   But Instagram has decided, no, we're going to turn that off.
[00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:30.860]   We're going to make you click the link and go to our site,
[00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:32.340]   which makes sense, because of course,
[00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:33.980]   that's where their revenue is, right?
[00:29:33.980 --> 00:29:35.500]   But he will accept.
[00:29:35.500 --> 00:29:38.300]   I've talked on the show about reposted us about the new--
[00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:40.460]   I mean, you would think these companies
[00:29:40.460 --> 00:29:41.980]   would be more sophisticated than media companies
[00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:44.180]   and they don't realize they have to make themselves embeddable.
[00:29:44.180 --> 00:29:46.380]   That's the model you've got to flow with here.
[00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:48.140]   And instead, they're going to an old media model
[00:29:48.140 --> 00:29:49.780]   and say, no, you have to come to our site.
[00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:51.860]   And we're going to show you stupid ads.
[00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:54.620]   And we're going to piss you off as a user.
[00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:58.100]   Where they are, Wall Street Journal?
[00:29:58.100 --> 00:30:01.500]   Apparently, Kevin Systrom, he's talking today at Lilweb
[00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:05.700]   in Paris, confirmed the company has removed the abilities
[00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:08.780]   to send pictures to Twitter.
[00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:09.300]   Is that true?
[00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:11.140]   They removed it from the app.
[00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:13.660]   And plans to completely cut off embedding pictures
[00:30:13.660 --> 00:30:15.100]   on the Twitter website.
[00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:17.140]   That is a dangerous thing to do.
[00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:18.100]   It really is.
[00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:20.460]   And do you think that that was his response at all,
[00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:22.460]   or was this an order from on high?
[00:30:22.460 --> 00:30:24.580]   We've decided, quote, we've decided
[00:30:24.580 --> 00:30:27.060]   that right now what makes sense is to direct our users
[00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:30.820]   to the Instagram website, end quote.
[00:30:30.820 --> 00:30:35.380]   So you can't even just tweet the link,
[00:30:35.380 --> 00:30:36.700]   but it just wouldn't show up the card.
[00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:37.220]   I don't know.
[00:30:37.220 --> 00:30:37.820]   They take--
[00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:41.020]   They actually removed the whole thing.
[00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:43.020]   That's what I'm getting from this quote, which
[00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:45.420]   doesn't seem quite right.
[00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:52.300]   I knew that Twitter cards weren't working,
[00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:54.020]   but I haven't got an update for Instagram
[00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:55.460]   that doesn't have Twitter in it.
[00:30:55.460 --> 00:30:56.820]   Is that what he's implying?
[00:30:56.820 --> 00:30:59.500]   It sounds like that's what he's implying.
[00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:00.700]   I think all you'll get in Twitter
[00:31:00.700 --> 00:31:03.340]   is a link to the photo on Instagram, right?
[00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:03.700]   That's it?
[00:31:03.700 --> 00:31:04.700]   Right, right, right.
[00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:05.300]   So you just get to--
[00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:06.300]   That I understand.
[00:31:06.300 --> 00:31:08.620]   But in the Instagram app is the option
[00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:10.420]   to tweet that photo removed.
[00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:12.020]   I don't want to even that out.
[00:31:12.020 --> 00:31:13.020]   That was even state.
[00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:13.860]   That was even state.
[00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:14.700]   Crazy.
[00:31:14.700 --> 00:31:16.980]   That's not going to happen.
[00:31:16.980 --> 00:31:19.180]   That can't happen.
[00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:22.620]   I mean, I think this is crazy.
[00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:25.100]   For developers who feel worried or slighted
[00:31:25.100 --> 00:31:28.180]   by the limitations that Twitter's been putting on its own API,
[00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:30.300]   there's a little bit of a shot in front of you here.
[00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:32.500]   Like, oh, well, Twitter really wants people
[00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:34.420]   to integrate their content in Twitter, right?
[00:31:34.420 --> 00:31:37.020]   They want people to set up those Twitter cards.
[00:31:37.020 --> 00:31:38.820]   And out here's Instagram saying, nope.
[00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:40.420]   Nope, not doing it.
[00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:42.340]   We're going to give Twitter users a worse experience.
[00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:43.780]   That's a really good point.
[00:31:43.780 --> 00:31:47.340]   As of right now, Twitter is in there still,
[00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:48.980]   but I didn't get an update to the app yet.
[00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:53.700]   So that must be a misunderstanding.
[00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:55.540]   I'm reading this from the New York Times.
[00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:56.460]   Nick Bilton's writing.
[00:31:56.460 --> 00:31:58.460]   So Nick knows aware of his speaks.
[00:31:58.460 --> 00:31:59.580]   And this is the quote.
[00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:01.180]   He says, speaking at low web, Kevin's
[00:32:01.180 --> 00:32:04.260]   system confirmed was Instagram CEO and founder,
[00:32:04.260 --> 00:32:07.420]   confirmed the company has removed the ability
[00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:10.380]   to send pictures to Twitter.
[00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:14.620]   Maybe that means that they're not going to support Twitter
[00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:18.540]   sucking those pictures.
[00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:20.740]   And plans to completely cut off embedding pictures
[00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:22.100]   on the Twitter website.
[00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:23.940]   The other thing, before we got in the air,
[00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:27.380]   we had our lovely chat, which people should come by for.
[00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:28.420]   Because they're very nice chats.
[00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:29.500]   We have a little bit of--
[00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:31.580]   We'll call it the pre-show T we do together.
[00:32:31.580 --> 00:32:33.820]   Anyway, as you were saying then,
[00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:35.900]   we were talking about then, the problem here
[00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:37.820]   is that somebody in Twitter said to me,
[00:32:37.820 --> 00:32:38.980]   it wasn't like a media model.
[00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:39.620]   It wasn't surprising.
[00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:41.420]   Everybody wants to regular their own pages.
[00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:44.780]   Yeah, except that, again, it's not their content.
[00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:46.340]   It's our content.
[00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:47.620]   Yeah, so it's very different.
[00:32:47.620 --> 00:32:50.300]   When you pull these control maneuvers,
[00:32:50.300 --> 00:32:53.900]   just look at-- if Instagram is the new Twitter,
[00:32:53.900 --> 00:32:58.180]   it could soon be the new MySpace.
[00:32:58.180 --> 00:33:00.180]   I wonder how much of this is in response to Twitter
[00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:02.780]   adding filters.
[00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:05.020]   Twitter's adding filters to their app.
[00:33:05.020 --> 00:33:08.380]   I just noticed that I just used the Twitter picture upload.
[00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:09.420]   And I saw the filters.
[00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:11.180]   I was like, oh, this looks new.
[00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:13.100]   And this looks familiar.
[00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:17.340]   Yeah, filters are what made Instagram, right?
[00:33:17.340 --> 00:33:17.860]   Let me--
[00:33:17.860 --> 00:33:21.300]   So who's the good guy and the bad guy in all this?
[00:33:21.300 --> 00:33:23.860]   There are-- neither one of them.
[00:33:23.860 --> 00:33:24.980]   But who gets screwed?
[00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:26.260]   I know who gets screwed.
[00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:27.020]   Us.
[00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:28.860]   Yep.
[00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:30.380]   So let me see these filters.
[00:33:30.380 --> 00:33:34.220]   All right, I'm going to save that.
[00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:37.100]   Maybe I don't have filters yet.
[00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:39.980]   Because there's the picture.
[00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:41.940]   Maybe they haven't-- they haven't updated.
[00:33:41.940 --> 00:33:43.460]   Are you an Android or iOS?
[00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:46.780]   Maybe it's only an iOS right now.
[00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:47.380]   Yeah.
[00:33:47.380 --> 00:33:48.740]   Which four are you using, Leo?
[00:33:48.740 --> 00:33:50.300]   This is the Note, the Galaxy Note 2.
[00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:52.380]   Well, they don't.
[00:33:52.380 --> 00:33:54.020]   Are you going to try the--
[00:33:54.020 --> 00:33:55.420]   four?
[00:33:55.420 --> 00:33:56.460]   No, I like the Note.
[00:33:56.460 --> 00:33:58.060]   I'm real happy with the Note.
[00:33:58.060 --> 00:34:00.860]   I like a Fablet.
[00:34:00.860 --> 00:34:03.220]   Giant Fablet.
[00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:05.900]   No, does it have Samsung's stuff on it?
[00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:07.020]   Yeah, a little bit.
[00:34:07.020 --> 00:34:09.620]   I had the unlocked international, but I wanted LTE.
[00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:10.660]   So I just got the Sprint one.
[00:34:10.660 --> 00:34:11.580]   Because Sprint's--
[00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:12.140]   What are you doing?
[00:34:12.140 --> 00:34:15.540]   LTE and Petaluma before any I use, guys.
[00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:17.300]   So for some reason.
[00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:19.780]   So I just traded in for the Sprint one.
[00:34:19.780 --> 00:34:22.180]   But it's otherwise the same.
[00:34:22.180 --> 00:34:24.100]   And there's not a lot of Sprint stuff on it.
[00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:26.980]   There's not a lot of Samsung stuff on it.
[00:34:26.980 --> 00:34:31.260]   There has to be some because it's got to support the S-pin.
[00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:32.140]   Yes.
[00:34:32.140 --> 00:34:33.140]   So the Note 2.
[00:34:33.140 --> 00:34:34.140]   Which I wish I had.
[00:34:34.140 --> 00:34:35.140]   Yeah, I like this.
[00:34:35.140 --> 00:34:36.660]   I love this phone.
[00:34:36.660 --> 00:34:37.380]   I really do love this phone.
[00:34:37.380 --> 00:34:39.940]   My problem right now is--
[00:34:39.940 --> 00:34:41.540]   this is the first time I've done this in life.
[00:34:41.540 --> 00:34:47.220]   I had some stuff from decent stuff from conferences and things
[00:34:47.220 --> 00:34:49.300]   that I didn't use that I sold on eBay.
[00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:53.140]   And I made that into my gadget flush fund.
[00:34:53.140 --> 00:34:54.980]   Now you get some money is paid.
[00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:58.020]   You went down, but now the gadgets I want I already have,
[00:34:58.020 --> 00:34:59.340]   and they're so cheap.
[00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:01.660]   I have my Google phone.
[00:35:01.660 --> 00:35:02.660]   I have my Google tablet.
[00:35:02.660 --> 00:35:03.660]   I have my Google laptop.
[00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:06.300]   What ward is a man need in life?
[00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:08.740]   Hey, the Pope's got Twitter.
[00:35:08.740 --> 00:35:10.380]   Oy.
[00:35:10.380 --> 00:35:11.340]   That's not the response.
[00:35:11.340 --> 00:35:12.580]   Not Oy.
[00:35:12.580 --> 00:35:14.420]   My mom used to say Oy-ve Maria.
[00:35:14.420 --> 00:35:15.820]   And I was very confused.
[00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:18.780]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:19.780]   So my mom--
[00:35:19.780 --> 00:35:21.420]   I think my mom used to say that too.
[00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:22.220]   Are you Jewish?
[00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:22.980]   Are you Catholic?
[00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:24.660]   What are you talking here?
[00:35:24.660 --> 00:35:27.740]   She was covering the waterfront.
[00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:31.620]   The Vatican announced Monday that the 85-year-old pontiff
[00:35:31.620 --> 00:35:34.780]   Pope Benedict the 16th would begin posting messages
[00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:38.140]   on Twitter December 12th.
[00:35:38.140 --> 00:35:40.220]   The Pope's first tweet lands December 12th.
[00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:41.420]   December 12th.
[00:35:41.420 --> 00:35:42.420]   That's the story.
[00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:43.420]   What?
[00:35:43.420 --> 00:35:45.340]   It's taken him a week to write his tweet.
[00:35:45.340 --> 00:35:48.780]   He's crafting that 140 characters the next seven days.
[00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:50.940]   It has to come from God.
[00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:55.220]   His handle is not at the real pope.
[00:35:55.220 --> 00:35:57.700]   That would be funny, though.
[00:35:57.700 --> 00:36:01.340]   His handle is at Pontifex, which is Latin for Pope.
[00:36:01.340 --> 00:36:04.060]   P-O-N-T-I-F-E-X.
[00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:08.260]   You've heard him called the pontiff, Pontifex.
[00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:10.180]   I hope his tweets are in Latin.
[00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:11.100]   That'd be cool.
[00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:12.420]   That would be cool.
[00:36:12.420 --> 00:36:15.860]   Though they're actually going to have them in 10 languages.
[00:36:15.860 --> 00:36:16.360]   Yeah.
[00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:19.020]   And they made a point of saying they're not infallible.
[00:36:19.020 --> 00:36:22.020]   So of course mine are.
[00:36:22.020 --> 00:36:22.620]   Wait a minute.
[00:36:22.620 --> 00:36:26.380]   They had to say, oh, by the way, while he is normally
[00:36:26.380 --> 00:36:29.060]   infallible, the tweets are not.
[00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:30.780]   Yes.
[00:36:30.780 --> 00:36:31.460]   They did?
[00:36:31.460 --> 00:36:32.380]   They did?
[00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:34.820]   Well, why aren't the tweets infallible?
[00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:35.300]   I know.
[00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:38.300]   If it's coming from the same guy,
[00:36:38.300 --> 00:36:41.700]   these are what he's got his infallibility shoes on.
[00:36:41.700 --> 00:36:42.540]   What is going on?
[00:36:42.540 --> 00:36:43.460]   I don't understand.
[00:36:43.460 --> 00:36:46.860]   So he will be accepting questions.
[00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:50.180]   I think he's been infallible on the internet, Leo.
[00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:55.420]   He will be accepting questions with the hashtag #AskPontifex.
[00:36:55.420 --> 00:36:57.740]   If you could spell it, then you have the right to ask.
[00:36:57.740 --> 00:37:00.500]   Can you imagine what that hashtag is going to be like real fast?
[00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:01.340]   Wait a minute.
[00:37:01.340 --> 00:37:01.860]   Let's see.
[00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:05.060]   Will Twitter enable editing the hashtag?
[00:37:05.060 --> 00:37:06.540]   Oh.
[00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:08.580]   Ooh.
[00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:09.460]   Let's look up right now.
[00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:10.620]   What's under that hashtag?
[00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:12.900]   When they asked the Vatican, why at Pontifex,
[00:37:12.900 --> 00:37:14.820]   they said all the other names have been taken.
[00:37:14.820 --> 00:37:19.220]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:37:19.220 --> 00:37:21.820]   I can spell Pontifex Pontifex.
[00:37:21.820 --> 00:37:22.300]   Yeah.
[00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:23.020]   Well, you got to know.
[00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:24.980]   If you don't know, you don't get to ask the pope.
[00:37:24.980 --> 00:37:29.260]   P-O-N-T, Pont, I-F-E-X.
[00:37:29.260 --> 00:37:32.300]   This #AskPontifex hashtag is--
[00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:33.140]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:37:33.140 --> 00:37:34.660]   --the Illuminati real.
[00:37:34.660 --> 00:37:37.460]   I think Father Robert Ballasie is helping him.
[00:37:37.460 --> 00:37:41.020]   Is it true that if I pushed down on your half nannies or your mouth?
[00:37:41.020 --> 00:37:42.300]   Should we search?
[00:37:42.300 --> 00:37:44.060]   I'll clean this up.
[00:37:44.060 --> 00:37:46.300]   No, I won't even-- I won't even-- even I won't read that one.
[00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:47.700]   No, never mind.
[00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:50.380]   Well, I hope the pope has some cardinal
[00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:53.980]   who's going to read this stuff, because I don't want him to see it.
[00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:55.660]   He's an older man.
[00:37:55.660 --> 00:37:57.180]   His eyes could be burning.
[00:37:57.180 --> 00:38:00.060]   Stick the verb fair, arched in German as something.
[00:38:00.060 --> 00:38:01.140]   Here's one.
[00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:03.540]   A question about the faith.
[00:38:03.540 --> 00:38:05.620]   Do you think George Michael could have done a better song
[00:38:05.620 --> 00:38:07.860]   if he'd brought Timberland as the producer?
[00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:09.540]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:38:09.540 --> 00:38:10.460]   Who would win a fight?
[00:38:10.460 --> 00:38:12.860]   You got to have faith, faith, faith.
[00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:15.340]   Who would win a fight between Jesus Christ and Wolverine?
[00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:16.740]   No, really?
[00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:19.140]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:38:19.140 --> 00:38:22.980]   What does the one thing that me love won't do for love?
[00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:23.620]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:38:23.620 --> 00:38:24.860]   You would do anything for love.
[00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:26.100]   You would do anything for love.
[00:38:26.100 --> 00:38:27.300]   That's the right answer.
[00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:28.500]   That is the right answer.
[00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:29.820]   Is the Illuminati real?
[00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:30.820]   Now, that's a good question.
[00:38:30.820 --> 00:38:31.620]   I doubt he'll answer it.
[00:38:31.620 --> 00:38:37.740]   Is there a war on feminism?
[00:38:37.740 --> 00:38:38.940]   You know what?
[00:38:38.940 --> 00:38:40.020]   Oh, geez.
[00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:41.700]   I won't read that one either.
[00:38:41.700 --> 00:38:42.700]   Thank you so much.
[00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:44.100]   [SCREAMING]
[00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:45.900]   It's a topical discussion earlier with Jesus.
[00:38:45.900 --> 00:38:48.660]   I just saw the one you won't read,
[00:38:48.660 --> 00:38:51.180]   and I think I'm not going to read the same one.
[00:38:51.180 --> 00:38:53.300]   I was trying to create it up, but I thought no.
[00:38:53.300 --> 00:38:56.460]   So far, there is only one question for the pope that
[00:38:56.460 --> 00:38:59.580]   is in any way serious that I've seen.
[00:38:59.580 --> 00:39:04.540]   Is it possible to merge the Novus-Ordo calendar of saints
[00:39:04.540 --> 00:39:09.180]   and scripture readings into the tridentine mass calendar
[00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:09.900]   in my lifetime?
[00:39:09.900 --> 00:39:11.860]   Oh, my god.
[00:39:11.860 --> 00:39:13.740]   Some cardinal put that in.
[00:39:13.740 --> 00:39:14.300]   Yeah.
[00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:20.260]   His Twitter handle is sparamos, which means we hope in Latin.
[00:39:20.260 --> 00:39:23.260]   So it's obviously a cardinal.
[00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:25.300]   Wow.
[00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:27.740]   This is really asking for trouble.
[00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:31.060]   Yeah.
[00:39:31.060 --> 00:39:32.180]   Poor priest.
[00:39:32.180 --> 00:39:33.180]   We have to go through these.
[00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:34.180]   We have to go through these.
[00:39:34.180 --> 00:39:35.180]   We have to go through these.
[00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:37.500]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:40.780]   What are the top two or three rules in the Bible
[00:39:40.780 --> 00:39:45.180]   that you would disregard because they aren't relevant today?
[00:39:45.180 --> 00:39:47.980]   You're asking the wrong guy.
[00:39:47.980 --> 00:39:48.500]   Wow.
[00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:49.340]   OK.
[00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:51.980]   And then compare and contrast.
[00:39:51.980 --> 00:39:54.460]   President Obama is using Twitter
[00:39:54.460 --> 00:39:56.900]   to answer questions about the fiscal cliff.
[00:39:56.900 --> 00:39:58.100]   What's the hashtag for that?
[00:39:58.100 --> 00:40:00.060]   You ready?
[00:40:00.060 --> 00:40:01.060]   My 2K, right?
[00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:03.300]   My 2K.
[00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:06.820]   My 2,000 bucks, which I'm going to get screwed out of if I'm
[00:40:06.820 --> 00:40:09.540]   middle class and we go over the cliff.
[00:40:09.540 --> 00:40:15.380]   So he tweeted today, I'll answer some cues on that at 2et.
[00:40:15.380 --> 00:40:16.860]   He's with it.
[00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:20.020]   He speaks the lingo of the streets.
[00:40:20.020 --> 00:40:21.340]   Yep.
[00:40:21.340 --> 00:40:22.940]   B.O. is how he signs everything.
[00:40:22.940 --> 00:40:24.100]   That poor guy.
[00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:25.620]   He must have been a roughness in high school.
[00:40:25.620 --> 00:40:26.140]   It doesn't look fortunate.
[00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:27.140]   No initials, yeah.
[00:40:27.140 --> 00:40:28.980]   Well, somebody said that he also thinks that.
[00:40:28.980 --> 00:40:30.300]   I think it was Comedy Central, so they always
[00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:31.500]   take us the dog writing.
[00:40:31.500 --> 00:40:32.500]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:40:32.500 --> 00:40:32.700]   Yeah.
[00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:33.700]   That's right.
[00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:37.140]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:38.700]   So let's see.
[00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:41.580]   He started, I guess, 2 PM Eastern time.
[00:40:41.580 --> 00:40:47.180]   Let's just search for some hashtag my 2K.
[00:40:47.180 --> 00:40:49.980]   I bet he's getting even stupider questions than the pope.
[00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:52.500]   No, actually, he's not.
[00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:54.260]   Now this is interesting.
[00:40:54.260 --> 00:41:00.380]   He's getting actually some good stuff.
[00:41:00.380 --> 00:41:02.060]   These are legitimate questions.
[00:41:02.060 --> 00:41:09.620]   I only did a behind the scenes videos of him actually tweeting.
[00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:12.100]   Well, we have that too of the pope not tweeting,
[00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:14.580]   but looking at an iPad from several years ago.
[00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:15.500]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:41:15.500 --> 00:41:17.980]   That's the best they could do.
[00:41:17.980 --> 00:41:18.500]   Wow.
[00:41:19.500 --> 00:41:24.500]   You remember that Obama-- I actually got a direct message
[00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:29.860]   from whatever whoever it is that's doing this campaign.
[00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:33.300]   Well, I was saying, help out or something.
[00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:34.540]   I read this, didn't I?
[00:41:34.540 --> 00:41:39.060]   Use your Twitter cloud to help Obama out.
[00:41:39.060 --> 00:41:45.980]   I can't use a new Twitter client.
[00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:47.460]   I don't even know how to get to DMs.
[00:41:47.460 --> 00:41:49.940]   Where are the DMs?
[00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:52.340]   You have to go to me and then under--
[00:41:52.340 --> 00:41:52.860]   Me?
[00:41:52.860 --> 00:41:53.260]   Yeah.
[00:41:53.260 --> 00:41:53.860]   Really?
[00:41:53.860 --> 00:41:54.620]   Yeah.
[00:41:54.620 --> 00:41:55.700]   Me?
[00:41:55.700 --> 00:41:56.740]   Yeah, I know.
[00:41:56.740 --> 00:41:57.340]   And then what?
[00:41:57.340 --> 00:41:59.940]   There's an envelope underneath.
[00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:01.220]   You barely see it to the right.
[00:42:01.220 --> 00:42:06.060]   Oh, that completely meaningless icon or blue dot
[00:42:06.060 --> 00:42:07.460]   with an M-- that's the direct message.
[00:42:07.460 --> 00:42:07.940]   Yeah.
[00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:08.740]   Yeah.
[00:42:08.740 --> 00:42:10.660]   She's Louise.
[00:42:10.660 --> 00:42:12.380]   And I don't read them because they're maybe--
[00:42:12.380 --> 00:42:15.580]   Yeah, use your Twitter influence to help turn out the vote.
[00:42:15.580 --> 00:42:18.220]   But he didn't ask me anything to help him with the fiscal cliff,
[00:42:18.220 --> 00:42:19.620]   so--
[00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:22.700]   Was that from Tech for Obama or was that from Barack Obama?
[00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:23.820]   From Barack Obama.
[00:42:23.820 --> 00:42:24.260]   Yeah.
[00:42:24.260 --> 00:42:25.700]   Yeah.
[00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:27.340]   But that's the campaign, right?
[00:42:27.340 --> 00:42:27.820]   Yeah.
[00:42:27.820 --> 00:42:28.700]   But what is it now?
[00:42:28.700 --> 00:42:31.820]   The campaign's over.
[00:42:31.820 --> 00:42:33.020]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:34.540]   Campaign never ends, Leo.
[00:42:34.540 --> 00:42:36.260]   No, no, you can't-- it's over.
[00:42:36.260 --> 00:42:37.740]   You can't run again.
[00:42:37.740 --> 00:42:38.180]   I know.
[00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:40.060]   I know that.
[00:42:40.060 --> 00:42:41.780]   It's over.
[00:42:41.780 --> 00:42:43.740]   He's the president.
[00:42:43.740 --> 00:42:45.220]   We got remedial twig this week.
[00:42:45.220 --> 00:42:48.580]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:42:48.580 --> 00:42:50.500]   I'm sorry.
[00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:51.420]   OK.
[00:42:51.420 --> 00:42:52.420]   OK.
[00:42:52.420 --> 00:42:52.920]   OK.
[00:42:52.920 --> 00:42:53.660]   Enough Twitter.
[00:42:53.660 --> 00:42:55.900]   We're going to move on.
[00:42:55.900 --> 00:42:57.420]   According to the San Francisco Chronicle,
[00:42:57.420 --> 00:43:01.700]   Google is gunning for Amazon.
[00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:03.580]   And you know who's gunning for Google?
[00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:05.820]   Could be the feds.
[00:43:05.820 --> 00:43:09.180]   We're waiting to hear anti-trust action against Google.
[00:43:09.180 --> 00:43:10.820]   It's possible.
[00:43:10.820 --> 00:43:14.700]   Leave of its-- our head of the FTC has been meeting with EU people
[00:43:14.700 --> 00:43:15.420]   and trying to figure it out.
[00:43:15.420 --> 00:43:17.380]   The word is-- I think we've mentioned this last week,
[00:43:17.380 --> 00:43:17.900]   very briefly.
[00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:21.980]   The word is that the FTC kind of can't figure out how to make a case.
[00:43:21.980 --> 00:43:22.540]   They're huddling.
[00:43:22.540 --> 00:43:24.460]   That won't stop the EU, but you know--
[00:43:24.460 --> 00:43:26.380]   They're huddling.
[00:43:26.380 --> 00:43:26.860]   And--
[00:43:26.860 --> 00:43:29.380]   And Eric Schmidt is basically saying,
[00:43:29.380 --> 00:43:30.540]   I wish they'd make up their mind and do something.
[00:43:30.540 --> 00:43:33.020]   Yeah.
[00:43:33.020 --> 00:43:34.900]   I know what he wishes they would do.
[00:43:34.900 --> 00:43:35.860]   Oh, yeah.
[00:43:35.860 --> 00:43:38.500]   Go to stamps.com, so they don't have to go to the post office.
[00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:40.140]   That's what he wishes.
[00:43:40.140 --> 00:43:43.580]   To file those huge documents against me.
[00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:48.780]   If you're mailing a lot of depositions, court documents,
[00:43:48.780 --> 00:43:52.140]   printed emails, you don't want to go to the post office
[00:43:52.140 --> 00:43:55.020]   with those case-- all those banker boxes.
[00:43:55.020 --> 00:43:57.420]   That's just trouble, because there's
[00:43:57.420 --> 00:43:59.820]   lots of people there with their Christmas card list.
[00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:00.820]   And the lines are long.
[00:44:00.820 --> 00:44:03.980]   The parking stuff-- this is why you use stamps.com.
[00:44:03.980 --> 00:44:06.060]   I bet you Google's lawyers use stamps.com,
[00:44:06.060 --> 00:44:10.220]   because with stamps.com, you can print your own legal US
[00:44:10.220 --> 00:44:12.540]   postage right from your computer and printer.
[00:44:12.540 --> 00:44:14.340]   You never have to go to the post office.
[00:44:14.340 --> 00:44:16.340]   You get the USB scale, so you always know.
[00:44:16.340 --> 00:44:18.500]   And by the-- you know, the exact postage.
[00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:20.740]   And by the way, you can print right on the envelopes
[00:44:20.740 --> 00:44:21.380]   for letters.
[00:44:21.380 --> 00:44:22.180]   And that's great.
[00:44:22.180 --> 00:44:25.300]   It'll take the address book information or QuickBooks.
[00:44:25.300 --> 00:44:27.940]   If you're an Amazon or eBay or Etsy or PayPal seller,
[00:44:27.940 --> 00:44:28.460]   that kind of thing.
[00:44:28.460 --> 00:44:30.140]   It takes it right from the web page.
[00:44:30.140 --> 00:44:33.180]   So it prints it right on the envelope or the packing label.
[00:44:33.180 --> 00:44:35.620]   If you get discounts from Priority Mail and Express Mail,
[00:44:35.620 --> 00:44:37.580]   you can't even get at the post office.
[00:44:37.580 --> 00:44:40.100]   And if you're sending with one of these certified mail systems,
[00:44:40.100 --> 00:44:43.140]   it will send an email to your recipient saying that it's on its way.
[00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:44.620]   Here's the tracking information.
[00:44:44.620 --> 00:44:46.220]   This is efficient.
[00:44:46.220 --> 00:44:49.060]   This is mail for pros.
[00:44:49.060 --> 00:44:53.380]   If you're an email professional or a mail professional,
[00:44:53.380 --> 00:44:55.780]   snail mail professional, if you do a lot of this

[00:44:58.420 --> 00:45:00.780]   Now, when you go to stamps.com, you're probably
[00:45:00.780 --> 00:45:02.380]   going to be tempted right from the beginning,
[00:45:02.380 --> 00:45:05.580]   because in the front page it says $80, no risk trial.
[00:45:05.580 --> 00:45:06.180]   But don't.
[00:45:06.180 --> 00:45:08.700]   I could do better if you click the radio microphone.
[00:45:08.700 --> 00:45:11.500]   It's in the upper right-hand corner there,
[00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:13.060]   where it says welcome.
[00:45:13.060 --> 00:45:19.420]   Get started and enter in the offer code TWIG TWIG, $110
[00:45:19.420 --> 00:45:21.820]   bonus value, $55 in postage coupons

[00:45:25.060 --> 00:45:26.460]   You get the digital scales free.
[00:45:26.460 --> 00:45:27.820]   You just pay shipping and handling.
[00:45:27.820 --> 00:45:29.380]   It's $5.
[00:45:29.380 --> 00:45:30.780]   By the way, it's not that digital scale.
[00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:31.900]   They got a nice new one.
[00:45:31.900 --> 00:45:35.500]   They got a brushed Aluminium digital scale.
[00:45:35.500 --> 00:45:39.300]   You also get a $5 supply kit in a four-week trial.
[00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:41.660]   So go to stamps.com, click the radio microphone,
[00:45:41.660 --> 00:45:45.420]   use our offer code TWIG, and become a mailing professional.
[00:45:45.420 --> 00:45:49.980]   This is my pro tip for people who do mailing.
[00:45:49.980 --> 00:45:53.060]   Stamps.com.
[00:45:53.060 --> 00:45:54.500]   You will never go to the post office.
[00:45:54.500 --> 00:45:55.820]   Again, you will love it.
[00:45:55.820 --> 00:45:57.580]   I promise.
[00:45:57.580 --> 00:45:58.580]   And you know what?
[00:45:58.580 --> 00:45:59.700]   It's no risk.
[00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:01.460]   Let's try it.
[00:46:01.460 --> 00:46:04.820]   So as you said, the top US and European--
[00:46:04.820 --> 00:46:06.380]   there's lots of stuff going on this week.
[00:46:06.380 --> 00:46:07.860]   They're meeting in Europe.
[00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:10.820]   In Dubai, the International Telecommunications Union
[00:46:10.820 --> 00:46:13.100]   is meeting behind closed doors.
[00:46:13.100 --> 00:46:15.420]   And already, the US and Canada tried
[00:46:15.420 --> 00:46:18.380]   to limit the definition of what they were going to talk about
[00:46:18.380 --> 00:46:19.300]   to telephone companies.
[00:46:19.300 --> 00:46:20.140]   Good.
[00:46:20.140 --> 00:46:21.780]   And when they failed.
[00:46:21.780 --> 00:46:24.900]   And so that means that the likes of Google and Facebook
[00:46:24.900 --> 00:46:28.100]   could, in the ITU's view, be under the ITU's purview.
[00:46:28.100 --> 00:46:29.300]   How's that for speak?
[00:46:29.300 --> 00:46:30.340]   This is dangerous.
[00:46:30.340 --> 00:46:31.700]   This is really scary.
[00:46:31.700 --> 00:46:32.220]   Robinson.
[00:46:32.220 --> 00:46:34.260]   It's very scary.
[00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:37.420]   So how do we know what's going on?
[00:46:37.420 --> 00:46:39.220]   Are there reporters inside?
[00:46:39.220 --> 00:46:42.580]   No, but I think the US came out.
[00:46:42.580 --> 00:46:45.300]   He's trying to reveal what they're trying to do.
[00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:46.780]   Yeah.
[00:46:46.780 --> 00:46:49.780]   What's the best way to follow what's going on with this?
[00:46:49.780 --> 00:46:50.700]   Good question.
[00:46:50.700 --> 00:46:51.580]   That's a good question.
[00:46:51.580 --> 00:46:53.780]   I don't know who's doing good reporting on it per se.
[00:46:53.780 --> 00:46:55.860]   It's kind of all over.
[00:46:55.860 --> 00:46:57.740]   Is Corey Doctorow talking about it?
[00:46:57.740 --> 00:46:59.660]   Because I know he's--
[00:46:59.660 --> 00:47:01.940]   But I think Vince has been surfed there.
[00:47:01.940 --> 00:47:03.820]   Or he's been lobbying.
[00:47:03.820 --> 00:47:05.860]   Because on behalf of Google, he's a Google fellow.
[00:47:05.860 --> 00:47:07.740]   I want Andy Carvin embedded there.
[00:47:07.740 --> 00:47:08.700]   Yes.
[00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:09.820]   Exactly.
[00:47:09.820 --> 00:47:11.860]   So there's two things going on.
[00:47:11.860 --> 00:47:14.340]   There's one that might be a little bit of a red herring,
[00:47:14.340 --> 00:47:17.620]   which is this petition by Russia and others
[00:47:17.620 --> 00:47:19.660]   to have the United Nations regulate the internet.
[00:47:19.660 --> 00:47:21.180]   Bad idea, obviously.
[00:47:21.180 --> 00:47:22.900]   But apparently, the bigger concern
[00:47:22.900 --> 00:47:25.740]   is that telecoms, particularly European telecoms,
[00:47:25.740 --> 00:47:30.060]   want to establish-- basically, you pay for the internet the way
[00:47:30.060 --> 00:47:31.660]   you pay for telephone service.
[00:47:31.660 --> 00:47:38.300]   They want Google, Facebook, Twitter to pay not only for our access
[00:47:38.300 --> 00:47:41.380]   to the internet, but to pay for access
[00:47:41.380 --> 00:47:42.940]   to the users on the internet.
[00:47:42.940 --> 00:47:45.460]   Double dip, in effect.
[00:47:45.460 --> 00:47:47.940]   So AT&T would say, oh, well, Leo, yes,
[00:47:47.940 --> 00:47:49.740]   I could see you're putting stuff on the internet.
[00:47:49.740 --> 00:47:52.380]   But if you would like it to reach our customers,
[00:47:52.380 --> 00:47:56.260]   you should give us some money, too.
[00:47:56.260 --> 00:47:58.020]   Which has been going on for ages.
[00:47:58.020 --> 00:47:59.300]   It goes back to the day.
[00:47:59.300 --> 00:48:00.580]   But I know that-- what's his name?
[00:48:00.580 --> 00:48:01.820]   Milo Medin.
[00:48:01.820 --> 00:48:03.300]   Yeah, love Milo.
[00:48:03.300 --> 00:48:03.940]   Milo's great.
[00:48:03.940 --> 00:48:07.620]   He was at-- and he's now in charge of the Kansas City
[00:48:07.620 --> 00:48:08.580]   Google effort.
[00:48:08.580 --> 00:48:10.380]   But I remember back in the days when Milo was at site.
[00:48:10.380 --> 00:48:11.300]   Is that at home?
[00:48:11.300 --> 00:48:11.820]   Or at site.
[00:48:11.820 --> 00:48:12.820]   Yeah, site home.
[00:48:12.820 --> 00:48:13.820]   Yeah.
[00:48:13.820 --> 00:48:14.140]   Whatever the-- right.
[00:48:14.140 --> 00:48:17.420]   And they were talking about that model back then.
[00:48:17.420 --> 00:48:20.900]   And saying, well, if you want really good access,
[00:48:20.900 --> 00:48:25.100]   you could come right to our servers, right to our head end.
[00:48:25.100 --> 00:48:26.620]   But we're going to charge it for that.
[00:48:26.620 --> 00:48:28.980]   And I understand if you're a business that makes sense
[00:48:28.980 --> 00:48:33.180]   to you, it's a toll road.
[00:48:33.180 --> 00:48:35.380]   But that's the interest of those businesses.
[00:48:35.380 --> 00:48:38.220]   It's not the interest of us as the users of internet
[00:48:38.220 --> 00:48:39.500]   for free and open internet.
[00:48:39.500 --> 00:48:41.380]   And it's not that they're not getting paid, believe me.
[00:48:41.380 --> 00:48:43.700]   They're getting paid.
[00:48:43.700 --> 00:48:45.860]   It's that they want to charge twice, basically.
[00:48:45.860 --> 00:48:50.860]   I don't know what to--
[00:48:50.860 --> 00:48:54.340]   I mean, is this even a possibility that this could happen?
[00:48:54.340 --> 00:48:56.500]   Well, I think what the problem is,
[00:48:56.500 --> 00:48:58.540]   we're going to put up the cat signal again
[00:48:58.540 --> 00:48:59.540]   and again and again.
[00:48:59.540 --> 00:49:02.220]   Cry Wolf mixed by metaphors of animals here.
[00:49:02.220 --> 00:49:07.700]   But yeah, at some point, one thing is not going to happen.
[00:49:07.700 --> 00:49:09.140]   And so people will say, I, you see,
[00:49:09.140 --> 00:49:10.140]   you just call it Cry Wolf.
[00:49:10.140 --> 00:49:13.100]   But it's an indication of a constant gnawing.
[00:49:13.100 --> 00:49:14.540]   Well, they're going to always push for it.
[00:49:14.540 --> 00:49:15.420]   And I just--
[00:49:15.420 --> 00:49:16.060]   Exactly.
[00:49:16.060 --> 00:49:17.620]   And because this is behind closed doors,
[00:49:17.620 --> 00:49:21.020]   we don't really know what the reaction-- the ITU
[00:49:21.020 --> 00:49:22.580]   could be laughing.
[00:49:22.580 --> 00:49:23.180]   Right.
[00:49:23.180 --> 00:49:24.420]   We don't know.
[00:49:24.420 --> 00:49:26.940]   What I don't know is what they're--
[00:49:26.940 --> 00:49:30.180]   what I haven't seen is a story that explains,
[00:49:30.180 --> 00:49:32.860]   I get what various parties want to do.
[00:49:32.860 --> 00:49:36.100]   What power does the ITU have to actually do it?
[00:49:36.100 --> 00:49:37.700]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:49:37.700 --> 00:49:39.620]   That's what I don't know is what's
[00:49:39.620 --> 00:49:42.860]   in the realm of the possible with what they could actually
[00:49:42.860 --> 00:49:43.540]   pull off.
[00:49:43.540 --> 00:49:47.900]   Yeah, because we did have this conversation.
[00:49:47.900 --> 00:49:51.300]   I think we also have this conversation on Twitter.
[00:49:51.300 --> 00:49:54.900]   Everybody agree, the ITU has no authority or jurisdiction
[00:49:54.900 --> 00:49:56.420]   in this.
[00:49:56.420 --> 00:49:58.380]   But if nobody were scared, then you
[00:49:58.380 --> 00:50:00.260]   wouldn't have Google wasting political capital
[00:50:00.260 --> 00:50:02.460]   trying to complain about them.
[00:50:02.460 --> 00:50:04.460]   And that's not the case they are.
[00:50:04.460 --> 00:50:07.140]   And the United States government is saying, watch out, folks.
[00:50:07.140 --> 00:50:11.700]   And the European Commission passed a resolution
[00:50:11.700 --> 00:50:13.260]   against all this effort.
[00:50:13.260 --> 00:50:14.940]   So you put all that together.
[00:50:14.940 --> 00:50:17.340]   It's really a treaty-- what it is,
[00:50:17.340 --> 00:50:23.300]   a treaty conference of 150 nations
[00:50:23.300 --> 00:50:27.060]   on how telecom is regulated internationally.
[00:50:27.060 --> 00:50:28.740]   And because it's telecom, the problem
[00:50:28.740 --> 00:50:31.140]   is these rules are written in '88 pre-internet.
[00:50:31.140 --> 00:50:39.100]   And in theory, the ITU was formed
[00:50:39.100 --> 00:50:44.220]   to regulate telegraph transmissions in the 1880s.
[00:50:44.220 --> 00:50:46.620]   But in theory, telecom could extend to the internet.
[00:50:46.620 --> 00:50:51.940]   So there's all these different stakeholders.
[00:50:51.940 --> 00:50:54.420]   There's Russia that wants more control over the internet
[00:50:54.420 --> 00:50:55.420]   and the internet content.
[00:50:55.420 --> 00:51:01.620]   There's the telecoms that want to make more money
[00:51:01.620 --> 00:51:02.860]   on the internet.
[00:51:02.860 --> 00:51:05.780]   Right.
[00:51:05.780 --> 00:51:08.460]   There are various governments that want to censor
[00:51:08.460 --> 00:51:09.740]   what's on the internet.
[00:51:09.740 --> 00:51:10.900]   There are--
[00:51:10.900 --> 00:51:11.980]   There's security issues, too.
[00:51:11.980 --> 00:51:13.300]   The American and Canadian delegations
[00:51:13.300 --> 00:51:16.420]   are very interested in protecting against cyber terrorism.
[00:51:16.420 --> 00:51:18.500]   Yes.
[00:51:18.500 --> 00:51:21.660]   Although you could argue that we are the number one exporter
[00:51:21.660 --> 00:51:25.500]   of cyber terrorism in the US.
[00:51:25.500 --> 00:51:29.220]   I mean, I'll take it too far, which is what I do for a living.
[00:51:29.220 --> 00:51:31.820]   But the larger thing that's happening here
[00:51:31.820 --> 00:51:34.060]   is the internet disrupts governments.
[00:51:34.060 --> 00:51:37.020]   It disrupts every institution, and that includes governments
[00:51:37.020 --> 00:51:38.380]   in all kinds of ways.
[00:51:38.380 --> 00:51:42.500]   And they're going to defend themselves.
[00:51:42.500 --> 00:51:47.940]   The Reuters article that you linked to quotes, ITU
[00:51:47.940 --> 00:51:51.180]   Secretary General Hamadun Turay, saying
[00:51:51.180 --> 00:51:53.620]   that any major changes to the 1988 treaty
[00:51:53.620 --> 00:51:58.540]   would be adopted only with consensus approaching unanimity.
[00:51:58.540 --> 00:52:00.580]   That's been supposed-- but then--
[00:52:00.580 --> 00:52:03.620]   but again, yes, that's true in that form.
[00:52:03.620 --> 00:52:05.700]   But are there other agreements these people can come to
[00:52:05.700 --> 00:52:07.060]   in terms of how they operate?
[00:52:07.060 --> 00:52:10.180]   Maybe they'll agree on one thing or something.
[00:52:10.180 --> 00:52:11.660]   Yeah.
[00:52:11.660 --> 00:52:14.260]   Will you find five or six countries get together and say,
[00:52:14.260 --> 00:52:15.300]   yeah, I'll pass that law.
[00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:16.380]   You pass that law, too.
[00:52:16.380 --> 00:52:16.900]   Yeah, for sure.
[00:52:16.900 --> 00:52:17.380]   But then--
[00:52:17.380 --> 00:52:18.180]   And that's the other thing.
[00:52:18.180 --> 00:52:19.180]   And this is the treaty process.
[00:52:19.180 --> 00:52:20.340]   So there does have to be ratified,
[00:52:20.340 --> 00:52:23.820]   but it does not have to be ratified necessarily by Congress.
[00:52:23.820 --> 00:52:24.220]   Right.
[00:52:24.220 --> 00:52:28.220]   It could be-- I gather-- I don't understand international
[00:52:28.220 --> 00:52:30.900]   treaty law, but I gathered that, in some cases,
[00:52:30.900 --> 00:52:33.420]   the president can unilaterally just sign it.
[00:52:33.420 --> 00:52:34.060]   Yes.
[00:52:34.060 --> 00:52:34.660]   But I don't--
[00:52:34.660 --> 00:52:36.900]   But I don't know if this is one of those cases.
[00:52:36.900 --> 00:52:37.860]   Danger, danger.
[00:52:37.860 --> 00:52:39.700]   Danger, stranger, danger.
[00:52:39.700 --> 00:52:43.260]   Meanwhile, my friends in Germany, Christoph Keiza,
[00:52:43.260 --> 00:52:46.700]   who is the head of policy at actual Springer,
[00:52:46.700 --> 00:52:47.580]   a big publisher there.
[00:52:47.580 --> 00:52:49.500]   And they're the ones who've been pushing this whole--
[00:52:49.500 --> 00:52:54.140]   their pixel ozerect to the reggae.
[00:52:54.140 --> 00:52:57.460]   Said today in an interview, it's in German on the site there,
[00:52:57.460 --> 00:52:59.540]   but I just thought it amazing that he likened
[00:52:59.540 --> 00:53:01.860]   Google to the Taliban.
[00:53:01.860 --> 00:53:02.860]   What?
[00:53:02.860 --> 00:53:05.380]   This is like a Godwin law brought to Germany
[00:53:05.380 --> 00:53:07.300]   where they can't exactly make the Hitler reference.
[00:53:07.300 --> 00:53:10.620]   So what are they going to pick that?
[00:53:10.620 --> 00:53:11.780]   The Taliban.
[00:53:11.780 --> 00:53:12.700]   The Taliban.
[00:53:12.700 --> 00:53:15.980]   Now, the great irony is that I tweeted back to Keiza.
[00:53:15.980 --> 00:53:20.380]   It's time.
[00:53:20.380 --> 00:53:22.660]   Resistant to change, which is what he's saying.
[00:53:22.660 --> 00:53:25.980]   It's perhaps you?
[00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:26.480]   Yeah.
[00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:31.980]   All right, well, we'll see what happens there.
[00:53:31.980 --> 00:53:33.420]   I was just trying to play the-- what is it?
[00:53:33.420 --> 00:53:35.820]   Light-dung-shoots-recht?
[00:53:35.820 --> 00:53:36.900]   Light-dung-shoots-recht.
[00:53:36.900 --> 00:53:38.620]   Light-dung-shoots-recht.
[00:53:38.620 --> 00:53:42.380]   It's a little German lesson in reggae.
[00:53:42.380 --> 00:53:45.380]   I got to play this every show from now.
[00:53:45.380 --> 00:53:46.380]   Every show.
[00:53:46.380 --> 00:53:47.380]   Light-dung-shoots-recht.
[00:53:47.380 --> 00:53:50.460]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:53:50.460 --> 00:53:53.020]   While you're listening, the Light-dung-shoots-recht.
[00:53:53.020 --> 00:53:54.540]   The mellow tunes of light-dungs.
[00:53:54.540 --> 00:53:58.620]   This was Trump video from Twig.
[00:53:58.620 --> 00:54:00.980]   They say, "My alleged twigs copyright."
[00:54:00.980 --> 00:54:02.980]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:54:02.980 --> 00:54:04.620]   It is.
[00:54:04.620 --> 00:54:08.660]   I'm going to pull this video off YouTube right now.
[00:54:08.660 --> 00:54:11.780]   Let's take a break a talk more with Jeff Gina on this week
[00:54:11.780 --> 00:54:12.620]   in Google.
[00:54:12.620 --> 00:54:15.620]   I think we should always have reggae music for all our ads.
[00:54:15.620 --> 00:54:16.120]   Yeah.
[00:54:16.120 --> 00:54:17.620]   And Light-dungs-shoots-recht.
[00:54:17.620 --> 00:54:19.900]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:54:19.900 --> 00:54:23.260]   And Light-dungs-shoots-recht.
[00:54:23.260 --> 00:54:27.340]   I wish we had a sponsor named Light-dungs-shoots-recht.
[00:54:27.340 --> 00:54:28.420]   We don't, though.
[00:54:28.420 --> 00:54:30.900]   We do have one called Squarespace.
[00:54:30.900 --> 00:54:33.140]   If you are ready for a new website,
[00:54:33.140 --> 00:54:35.420]   if you have decided the time has come to,
[00:54:35.420 --> 00:54:39.340]   put your flag to place your flag in the sand of the internet
[00:54:39.340 --> 00:54:43.060]   and say, "I am here. I exist." Then Squarespace is everything
[00:54:43.060 --> 00:54:43.620]   you need.
[00:54:43.620 --> 00:54:44.860]   It's the hosting.
[00:54:44.860 --> 00:54:46.380]   It's the software.
[00:54:46.380 --> 00:54:48.380]   It's the incredible uptime.
[00:54:48.380 --> 00:54:53.300]   The amazing price Squarespace is fantastic.
[00:54:53.300 --> 00:54:54.300]   We love it.
[00:54:54.300 --> 00:54:59.020]   And by the way, it's modern in the sense that, for instance--
[00:54:59.020 --> 00:55:02.660]   and this is-- we spent-- I don't know how many--
[00:55:02.660 --> 00:55:03.460]   actually, I do know.
[00:55:03.460 --> 00:55:05.580]   I'm just-- I'm erasing it from my mind
[00:55:05.580 --> 00:55:08.860]   how much we spend on our Twig website.
[00:55:08.860 --> 00:55:11.140]   And then after we had it all done, they came to us and said,
[00:55:11.140 --> 00:55:13.460]   oh, and you want a mobile site?
[00:55:13.460 --> 00:55:16.540]   That'll be $7,000.
[00:55:16.540 --> 00:55:18.620]   So we said, well, yeah, you have to have a mobile site.
[00:55:18.620 --> 00:55:20.740]   Well, little did we know, you don't anymore.
[00:55:20.740 --> 00:55:23.460]   This is something called mobile responsive design.
[00:55:23.460 --> 00:55:25.300]   Your website should look the same.
[00:55:25.300 --> 00:55:26.860]   It should work on all platforms, right?
[00:55:26.860 --> 00:55:29.580]   You shouldn't have a separate site for people coming from mobile.
[00:55:29.580 --> 00:55:31.900]   That's so 1990s.
[00:55:31.900 --> 00:55:34.700]   So what they do on Squarespace and all their templates do this
[00:55:34.700 --> 00:55:36.900]   automatically, all their software does this automatically,
[00:55:36.900 --> 00:55:40.740]   is they rearrange, resize, repurpose to make sure
[00:55:40.740 --> 00:55:42.820]   that your site looks great on everything from a 3 and 1/2
[00:55:42.820 --> 00:55:48.660]   inch iPhone 3GS to a 27-inch Dell XPS1
[00:55:48.660 --> 00:55:49.980]   and everywhere in between.
[00:55:49.980 --> 00:55:53.060]   Every image processed into seven different sizes
[00:55:53.060 --> 00:55:56.620]   so that there's always just the right image for that device.
[00:55:56.620 --> 00:55:59.260]   The templates you use-- and by the way, you completely
[00:55:59.260 --> 00:56:02.500]   control how they look, which means they reflect well on US.
[00:56:02.500 --> 00:56:04.300]   This is important for artists, photographers.
[00:56:04.300 --> 00:56:07.900]   Anybody wants to, let's say, do a portfolio online or show off
[00:56:07.900 --> 00:56:10.180]   their style online.
[00:56:10.180 --> 00:56:12.820]   You get these great templates, but then you completely customize
[00:56:12.820 --> 00:56:16.220]   them to match your aesthetic.
[00:56:16.220 --> 00:56:19.060]   And they still all are mobile responsive.
[00:56:19.060 --> 00:56:24.180]   Drag and drop functionality, however, if you are a pro,
[00:56:24.180 --> 00:56:26.900]   they also support HTML5, CSS, JavaScript.
[00:56:26.900 --> 00:56:30.340]   They've got a very nice developer platform.
[00:56:30.340 --> 00:56:32.860]   It gives you complete code controls, syntax, coloring,
[00:56:32.860 --> 00:56:33.900]   and all that stuff.
[00:56:33.900 --> 00:56:36.300]   There's a new page builder tool called the Layout Engine
[00:56:36.300 --> 00:56:38.980]   that enables you to customize pages by adding
[00:56:38.980 --> 00:56:43.460]   blocks of content, like photos, videos, text, social media,
[00:56:43.460 --> 00:56:48.220]   Google Maps, LinkedIn, Facebook, Pinterest.
[00:56:48.220 --> 00:56:50.740]   So it's so great to set up this site.
[00:56:50.740 --> 00:56:52.420]   You can import all your existing content
[00:56:52.420 --> 00:56:55.660]   from your existing site and export it out
[00:56:55.660 --> 00:56:58.300]   so you're never trapped.
[00:56:58.300 --> 00:57:02.180]   I just think-- and then, and then, the price is right, too.
[00:57:02.180 --> 00:57:03.340]   So here's the deal.
[00:57:03.340 --> 00:57:06.820]   And I always admire-- and I think all our sponsors do this--
[00:57:06.820 --> 00:57:09.140]   the idea that they'll give you a free trial,
[00:57:09.140 --> 00:57:11.020]   because they believe in what they're doing.
[00:57:11.020 --> 00:57:11.620]   So much.
[00:57:11.620 --> 00:57:13.020]   They know, hey, just try it.
[00:57:13.020 --> 00:57:14.340]   No cost to you.
[00:57:14.340 --> 00:57:16.180]   You don't even need to give them any information.
[00:57:16.180 --> 00:57:17.460]   No credit card or anything.
[00:57:17.460 --> 00:57:20.340]   Just an email address and name of the site, a password,
[00:57:20.340 --> 00:57:21.940]   and you're done.
[00:57:21.940 --> 00:57:24.780]   And you can have it for 14 days, 24/7 support,
[00:57:24.780 --> 00:57:27.460]   the run of the place, if you decide to buy.
[00:57:27.460 --> 00:57:29.300]   If you say, after two weeks, yeah, I'm
[00:57:29.300 --> 00:57:30.900]   liking what I'm seeing.
[00:57:30.900 --> 00:57:32.460]   The price is right.
[00:57:32.460 --> 00:57:34.420]   Amazing.
[00:57:34.420 --> 00:57:36.260]   The basic plan is $8 a month.
[00:57:36.260 --> 00:57:38.500]   But I suggest-- that when you buy an annual plan,
[00:57:38.500 --> 00:57:41.300]   I suggest the unlimited plan.
[00:57:41.300 --> 00:57:43.940]   $20 a month, although if you pay for the year,
[00:57:43.940 --> 00:57:45.260]   it's only $16 a month.
[00:57:45.260 --> 00:57:47.980]   And I'll tell you how you could save more in a second.
[00:57:47.980 --> 00:57:50.380]   You get unlimited pages, unlimited galleries.
[00:57:50.380 --> 00:57:51.580]   Now imagine you're a photographer.
[00:57:51.580 --> 00:57:54.220]   You want a different gallery for each client, for instance.
[00:57:54.220 --> 00:57:56.100]   No problem.
[00:57:56.100 --> 00:58:01.140]   What if one of the clients happens to be one direction?
[00:58:01.140 --> 00:58:03.420]   And it gets tweeted and it blows up.
[00:58:03.420 --> 00:58:04.020]   No problem.
[00:58:04.020 --> 00:58:05.220]   Unlimited bandwidth.
[00:58:05.220 --> 00:58:05.660]   That's fine.
[00:58:05.660 --> 00:58:07.020]   It's part of the deal.
[00:58:07.020 --> 00:58:09.100]   $16 a month.
[00:58:09.100 --> 00:58:10.540]   You got lots and lots of images.
[00:58:10.540 --> 00:58:11.100]   No problem.
[00:58:11.100 --> 00:58:14.060]   You have unlimited storage.
[00:58:14.060 --> 00:58:16.540]   Unlimited storage.
[00:58:16.540 --> 00:58:18.900]   You want other people-- maybe you want
[00:58:18.900 --> 00:58:21.980]   to do a newspaper site, unlimited contributors.
[00:58:21.980 --> 00:58:23.780]   When you buy an annual plan, they'll
[00:58:23.780 --> 00:58:28.260]   get you the custom domain name and hook it up so that it goes
[00:58:28.260 --> 00:58:30.940]   to mynewnewspaper.com or whatever it is.
[00:58:30.940 --> 00:58:34.380]   They've got some very nice tools for integrating to Google
[00:58:34.380 --> 00:58:38.380]   apps and a Mailchimp, things like that chimp.
[00:58:38.380 --> 00:58:39.700]   I think Squarespace is amazing.
[00:58:39.700 --> 00:58:41.300]   I want you to try it free.
[00:58:41.300 --> 00:58:43.740]   It's no obligation.
[00:58:43.740 --> 00:58:46.460]   The only thing I would ask if you decide to buy--
[00:58:46.460 --> 00:58:52.300]   save 10% by using our offer code Twig12, TWIG12,
[00:58:52.300 --> 00:58:55.260]   and that way we get credit for it.
[00:58:55.260 --> 00:58:58.980]   Squarespace.com, the secret behind amazing sites,
[00:58:58.980 --> 00:59:02.100]   like maybe yours.
[00:59:02.100 --> 00:59:07.460]   Has somebody created Jeff Jarvis-Rastaman.squarespace.com?
[00:59:07.460 --> 00:59:08.460]   I saw it in the chat room.
[00:59:08.460 --> 00:59:09.220]   I wonder.
[00:59:09.220 --> 00:59:11.100]   Maybe it's just a thought.
[00:59:11.100 --> 00:59:13.020]   But that's the beauty of these two week sites.
[00:59:13.020 --> 00:59:15.540]   I asked Squarespace-- actually, Brian Brushwood asked
[00:59:15.540 --> 00:59:18.060]   Squarespace because they're always on NSFW saying,
[00:59:18.060 --> 00:59:19.060]   hey, create a site for this.
[00:59:19.060 --> 00:59:22.060]   They said, do you mind that we're doing that?
[00:59:22.060 --> 00:59:24.540]   Getting all these people to create two weeks free sites.
[00:59:24.540 --> 00:59:25.380]   No.
[00:59:25.380 --> 00:59:26.140]   We love it.
[00:59:26.140 --> 00:59:29.820]   The more people use Squarespace, the happier we are.
[00:59:29.820 --> 00:59:33.060]   So somebody should go there and create Jeff Jarvis-Rastaman.
[00:59:33.060 --> 00:59:34.140]   That's Squarespace.com.
[00:59:34.140 --> 00:59:35.580]   Squarespace is so interesting.
[00:59:35.580 --> 00:59:38.700]   They took a lot of the staff of Daylight for a strong--
[00:59:38.700 --> 00:59:39.940]   Did they-- I didn't know that.
[00:59:39.940 --> 00:59:40.860]   Yeah, they did.
[00:59:40.860 --> 00:59:43.220]   And from what I understand, they really
[00:59:43.220 --> 00:59:45.580]   need kind of business model where they want scale
[00:59:45.580 --> 00:59:46.460]   and they want to grow.
[00:59:46.460 --> 00:59:48.860]   And so more people who discover them in more ways,
[00:59:48.860 --> 00:59:50.260]   the better off they are.
[00:59:50.260 --> 00:59:52.140]   That's exactly right.
[00:59:52.140 --> 00:59:54.180]   That's the exact opposite, isn't it,
[00:59:54.180 --> 00:59:56.900]   of these people saying, oh, no, you've
[00:59:56.900 --> 00:59:57.780]   got to come to ours.
[00:59:57.780 --> 00:59:59.260]   No, no, we don't want to share it.
[00:59:59.260 --> 01:00:00.260]   No, no, no.
[01:00:00.260 --> 01:00:01.900]   It's a whole-- it's a different mindset.
[01:00:01.900 --> 01:00:02.900]   It's open versus closed.
[01:00:02.900 --> 01:00:03.780]   It's a media versus closed.
[01:00:03.780 --> 01:00:05.780]   I wrote a post last week, which I
[01:00:05.780 --> 01:00:08.020]   argued that we keep on looking at media as if it's content,
[01:00:08.020 --> 01:00:09.900]   where we should look at it as if it's service.
[01:00:09.900 --> 01:00:12.220]   Content is that which fills something.
[01:00:12.220 --> 01:00:15.820]   Service is that which does something.
[01:00:15.820 --> 01:00:16.220]   I like that.
[01:00:16.220 --> 01:00:18.460]   I was that for a bumper sticker for the day.
[01:00:18.460 --> 01:00:20.940]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:00:20.940 --> 01:00:26.740]   What if the something that you do is put out content?
[01:00:26.740 --> 01:00:27.780]   No, but you're not content.
[01:00:27.780 --> 01:00:28.740]   You're thinking you're content.
[01:00:28.740 --> 01:00:30.580]   I'm content, damn it.
[01:00:30.580 --> 01:00:32.580]   Nity.
[01:00:32.580 --> 01:00:33.380]   What am I?
[01:00:33.380 --> 01:00:35.380]   I'm a group hog.
[01:00:35.380 --> 01:00:39.020]   No, we're-- no, we are-- I tell you, we're a service.
[01:00:39.020 --> 01:00:42.980]   We are-- we keep lonely nerds company throughout the day.
[01:00:42.980 --> 01:00:45.300]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:00:45.300 --> 01:00:46.300]   Nerd sitters.
[01:00:46.300 --> 01:00:47.980]   We're nerd sitters.
[01:00:47.980 --> 01:00:50.300]   If you're worried about leaving your nerd at home alone,
[01:00:50.300 --> 01:00:50.820]   don't worry.
[01:00:50.820 --> 01:00:53.020]   Just put them in front of the computer or the TV
[01:00:53.020 --> 01:00:57.780]   and have Twit.tv on, and they'll feel right at home.
[01:00:57.780 --> 01:00:59.420]   They'll never even miss you.
[01:00:59.420 --> 01:01:00.340]   You'll come back.
[01:01:00.340 --> 01:01:02.260]   They'll look up, said, did you leave?
[01:01:02.260 --> 01:01:03.740]   Oh.
[01:01:03.740 --> 01:01:04.620]   And they'll go back.
[01:01:04.620 --> 01:01:06.580]   We're the nerd sitters.
[01:01:06.580 --> 01:01:07.940]   I like it.
[01:01:07.940 --> 01:01:11.980]   I think you are the Barney for nerds.
[01:01:11.980 --> 01:01:16.300]   So apparently, the house took a vote just in case
[01:01:16.300 --> 01:01:18.700]   you were wondering.
[01:01:18.700 --> 01:01:25.620]   The US House has now voted 397 to nothing
[01:01:25.620 --> 01:01:28.700]   to keep the internet out of UN hands.
[01:01:28.700 --> 01:01:33.580]   There was a nonpartisan item we can all agree on.
[01:01:33.580 --> 01:01:39.340]   397 to nothing was a Senate resolution introduced
[01:01:39.340 --> 01:01:41.140]   by Clare McCaskill and Marco Rubio.
[01:01:41.140 --> 01:01:44.940]   Well, good.
[01:01:44.940 --> 01:01:46.860]   I'm glad we know.
[01:01:46.860 --> 01:01:48.060]   The house doesn't like it.
[01:01:48.060 --> 01:01:57.020]   Don't they have something more important going on right now?
[01:01:57.020 --> 01:01:57.620]   Seems to--
[01:01:57.620 --> 01:01:59.580]   No, they have a fiction of the physical cliff.
[01:01:59.580 --> 01:02:00.340]   That's just a--
[01:02:00.340 --> 01:02:01.620]   Oh, it's a fiction?
[01:02:01.620 --> 01:02:02.300]   Oh, good.
[01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:04.060]   OK.
[01:02:04.060 --> 01:02:04.580]   Made up.
[01:02:04.580 --> 01:02:05.260]   I feel better now.
[01:02:05.260 --> 01:02:09.900]   You mentioned Eric Schmidt saying,
[01:02:09.900 --> 01:02:11.700]   I wish they would just make up their mind
[01:02:11.700 --> 01:02:13.380]   whether they're going to sue us.
[01:02:13.380 --> 01:02:13.580]   He was in--
[01:02:13.580 --> 01:02:14.020]   What's happened?
[01:02:14.020 --> 01:02:15.540]   He's talking about not the government.
[01:02:15.540 --> 01:02:17.020]   Oh, well, both.
[01:02:17.020 --> 01:02:17.660]   Both, actually.
[01:02:17.660 --> 01:02:18.180]   Both.
[01:02:18.180 --> 01:02:18.980]   He's in--
[01:02:18.980 --> 01:02:20.220]   He's talking to Apple.
[01:02:20.220 --> 01:02:23.580]   He's saying he doesn't understand why Apple sued
[01:02:23.580 --> 01:02:27.020]   their partners and not them.
[01:02:27.020 --> 01:02:29.380]   That's a red flag for the bull, isn't it?
[01:02:29.380 --> 01:02:32.020]   Well, maybe he would like them to turn away
[01:02:32.020 --> 01:02:35.300]   from their motor roller and HTC and Samsung.
[01:02:35.300 --> 01:02:35.900]   And--
[01:02:35.900 --> 01:02:37.380]   You know.
[01:02:37.380 --> 01:02:37.900]   It's--
[01:02:37.900 --> 01:02:38.340]   Come on.
[01:02:38.340 --> 01:02:39.780]   Come on.
[01:02:39.780 --> 01:02:40.500]   It's that, right?
[01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:40.940]   Where they--
[01:02:40.940 --> 01:02:41.460]   Yeah.
[01:02:41.460 --> 01:02:42.860]   Yeah.
[01:02:42.860 --> 01:02:43.540]   What is that?
[01:02:43.540 --> 01:02:44.700]   He's doing the crane.
[01:02:45.700 --> 01:02:46.300]   And he's going--
[01:02:46.300 --> 01:02:47.300]   I--
[01:02:47.300 --> 01:02:50.660]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:02:50.660 --> 01:02:53.420]   I shouldn't have eaten that whole salami right before the show.
[01:02:53.420 --> 01:02:55.860]   That was a miss.
[01:02:55.860 --> 01:02:57.900]   How big is an antitrust lawsuit right now
[01:02:57.900 --> 01:03:03.100]   asked the Wall Street Journal of Mr. Eric Schmidt happens?
[01:03:03.100 --> 01:03:06.140]   I don't know, says Eric.
[01:03:06.140 --> 01:03:08.180]   We've been in quite continuous communications
[01:03:08.180 --> 01:03:10.380]   with both the Europeans and the Federal Trade Commission.
[01:03:10.380 --> 01:03:14.420]   It's time for them to sort of move to one resolution or another.
[01:03:14.420 --> 01:03:18.620]   It's not like they don't have a million documents and so forth.
[01:03:18.620 --> 01:03:20.740]   I remain optimistic.
[01:03:20.740 --> 01:03:23.260]   He, of course, at an all things deconferences,
[01:03:23.260 --> 01:03:26.660]   said that Google, Apple, Amazon, and Facebook
[01:03:26.660 --> 01:03:28.340]   were the gang of four companies that
[01:03:28.340 --> 01:03:29.780]   matter most in technology.
[01:03:29.780 --> 01:03:31.300]   They asked, do you still see it that way?
[01:03:31.300 --> 01:03:32.940]   He says, yes.
[01:03:32.940 --> 01:03:35.380]   He says, Eric says, we've never in our industry
[01:03:35.380 --> 01:03:38.260]   seen four network platforms of that scale.
[01:03:38.260 --> 01:03:39.020]   We've seen IBM.
[01:03:39.020 --> 01:03:40.300]   We've seen Microsoft.
[01:03:40.300 --> 01:03:41.580]   But now we have four.
[01:03:41.580 --> 01:03:43.940]   And the result in competition is a huge change
[01:03:43.940 --> 01:03:46.100]   in the industry.
[01:03:46.100 --> 01:03:48.700]   Which is all the reason why you shouldn't be going after it.
[01:03:48.700 --> 01:03:50.220]   I trust because we have all these new platforms.
[01:03:50.220 --> 01:03:50.980]   But you were saying.
[01:03:50.980 --> 01:03:56.220]   What I loved was his assessment of the Google Apple rivalry.
[01:03:56.220 --> 01:03:57.900]   And I think it was really right on
[01:03:57.900 --> 01:04:01.540]   and kind of a little bit of a lesson to the tech press.
[01:04:01.540 --> 01:04:03.220]   He says, the press would like to write
[01:04:03.220 --> 01:04:08.140]   the sort of teenage model of competition, which is, I have a gun.
[01:04:08.140 --> 01:04:10.220]   You have a gun who shirts first.
[01:04:10.220 --> 01:04:11.940]   No, that's how teenagers take and do it.
[01:04:11.940 --> 01:04:15.020]   And the adult way to run a business--
[01:04:15.020 --> 01:04:17.340]   and this actually sounds like exactly what's going on--
[01:04:17.340 --> 01:04:19.620]   is to run it more like a country.
[01:04:19.620 --> 01:04:21.260]   They have disputes.
[01:04:21.260 --> 01:04:23.340]   Yet they've actually been able to have huge trade
[01:04:23.340 --> 01:04:23.980]   with each other.
[01:04:23.980 --> 01:04:25.700]   They're not sending bombs at each other.
[01:04:25.700 --> 01:04:29.860]   He says, I think both Tim Cook and Larry Page
[01:04:29.860 --> 01:04:34.300]   have an understanding of this model of business as states.
[01:04:34.300 --> 01:04:35.900]   And when they and their teams meet,
[01:04:35.900 --> 01:04:37.580]   they just have a long list of things to talk about.
[01:04:37.580 --> 01:04:38.740]   They negotiate.
[01:04:38.740 --> 01:04:39.780]   They work it out.
[01:04:39.780 --> 01:04:40.780]   It's not a war.
[01:04:40.780 --> 01:04:46.020]   So I think that actually makes a lot of sense.
[01:04:46.020 --> 01:04:47.460]   It does make a lot of sense.
[01:04:47.460 --> 01:04:48.620]   I mean, that's a good way to explain it.
[01:04:48.620 --> 01:04:51.340]   I think that was also a negotiation in and of itself.
[01:04:51.340 --> 01:04:51.900]   What?
[01:04:51.900 --> 01:04:53.020]   Does saying that--
[01:04:53.020 --> 01:04:55.780]   That's him making a statement of negotiation.
[01:04:55.780 --> 01:04:57.700]   Because maybe Apple is acting like a teenager,
[01:04:57.700 --> 01:04:59.100]   but he's wanting them to act like an adult.
[01:04:59.100 --> 01:04:59.940]   Yeah.
[01:04:59.940 --> 01:05:05.180]   He's opening the door and giving the credit before perhaps it's due.
[01:05:05.180 --> 01:05:06.980]   And they can live up to that.
[01:05:06.980 --> 01:05:08.300]   I like this also.
[01:05:08.300 --> 01:05:11.500]   They asked, what's the end game of all this patent litigation?
[01:05:11.500 --> 01:05:12.180]   He says, you know what?
[01:05:12.180 --> 01:05:12.900]   It's going to go on.
[01:05:12.900 --> 01:05:13.900]   Google's going to do fine.
[01:05:13.900 --> 01:05:14.820]   Apple's going to do fine.
[01:05:14.820 --> 01:05:17.100]   Let me tell you who the loser is here.
[01:05:17.100 --> 01:05:21.260]   There's a young Andy Rubin, the guy who started Android,
[01:05:21.260 --> 01:05:24.020]   trying to form a new version of, let's say,
[01:05:24.020 --> 01:05:28.140]   danger, which is Rubin's company, that he started before Android.
[01:05:28.140 --> 01:05:30.460]   How is he or she going to be able to get the patent coverage
[01:05:30.460 --> 01:05:33.980]   necessary to offer version one of their product?
[01:05:33.980 --> 01:05:36.020]   So the real consequence of this is a complete loss
[01:05:36.020 --> 01:05:40.460]   of innovation because no one's going to be able to invent anything.
[01:05:40.460 --> 01:05:40.660]   Right.
[01:05:40.660 --> 01:05:42.220]   So it's not about companies.
[01:05:42.220 --> 01:05:43.060]   That's a bit money.
[01:05:43.060 --> 01:05:45.380]   It's about young companies that won't be able to build something
[01:05:45.380 --> 01:05:45.860]   interesting.
[01:05:45.860 --> 01:05:46.260]   Yeah.
[01:05:46.260 --> 01:05:47.500]   We've been saying that all along.
[01:05:47.500 --> 01:05:48.300]   He's absolutely right.
[01:05:48.300 --> 01:05:48.740]   Yep.
[01:05:48.740 --> 01:05:50.620]   Yep.
[01:05:50.620 --> 01:05:53.060]   So do you think what's your betting now, Eric's denying,
[01:05:53.060 --> 01:05:55.620]   but you always deny rumors are out again for him
[01:05:55.620 --> 01:05:59.060]   and Treasury Secretary?
[01:05:59.060 --> 01:06:01.020]   I don't know.
[01:06:01.020 --> 01:06:03.740]   If I were him, I wouldn't take it, but I could see him doing it.
[01:06:03.740 --> 01:06:04.900]   He spends a lot of time in Washington.
[01:06:04.900 --> 01:06:08.540]   I think he's a little enamored of the beltway.
[01:06:08.540 --> 01:06:11.300]   Enamored of and disgusted with at the same time, I think.
[01:06:11.300 --> 01:06:11.820]   Yeah.
[01:06:11.820 --> 01:06:13.420]   So the question is, does he have the hubris
[01:06:13.420 --> 01:06:16.380]   to think that he could actually improve it?
[01:06:16.380 --> 01:06:17.100]   Well, probably.
[01:06:17.100 --> 01:06:20.300]   You don't become CEO of Google unless you have some humor.
[01:06:20.300 --> 01:06:23.780]   Stuck away in your hip flask.
[01:06:23.780 --> 01:06:25.420]   Yeah.
[01:06:25.420 --> 01:06:27.300]   He says, they asked him.
[01:06:27.300 --> 01:06:28.740]   I'm glad they did.
[01:06:28.740 --> 01:06:30.500]   Well, you're going to do a wireless network.
[01:06:30.500 --> 01:06:31.740]   Because of course, we talked about this.
[01:06:31.740 --> 01:06:33.620]   The rumor of Google and Dish may be joining together
[01:06:33.620 --> 01:06:34.980]   to do a wireless network.
[01:06:34.980 --> 01:06:36.580]   Trent said, I'm sure we'll discuss this.
[01:06:36.580 --> 01:06:39.100]   But at the moment, we're busy working on Wireline in Kansas
[01:06:39.100 --> 01:06:42.220]   City, the gigabit ethernet.
[01:06:42.220 --> 01:06:45.700]   He says, the current spectrum shortage is real,
[01:06:45.700 --> 01:06:49.420]   but it's an artifact of a licensing and regulatory error.
[01:06:49.420 --> 01:06:51.620]   New technology allows it to be lots of spectrum,
[01:06:51.620 --> 01:06:53.900]   far more than you could use.
[01:06:53.900 --> 01:06:58.220]   But the regulators are preventing that, I guess.
[01:06:58.220 --> 01:07:00.780]   So he doesn't deny that Dish and Google might do something.
[01:07:00.780 --> 01:07:03.900]   But he says, we're more focused on Wireline right now.
[01:07:03.900 --> 01:07:06.740]   Oh, I hope I hope I hope I hope I hope I hope I hope.
[01:07:06.740 --> 01:07:08.020]   I know everybody hopes, but I think
[01:07:08.020 --> 01:07:10.220]   it's the hope that's speaking not the actual--
[01:07:10.220 --> 01:07:10.560]   I know.
[01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:11.780]   It's the same with Kansas City.
[01:07:11.780 --> 01:07:13.380]   I want Google services.
[01:07:13.380 --> 01:07:17.180]   Because I am Googleman.
[01:07:17.180 --> 01:07:18.180]   Yes.
[01:07:18.180 --> 01:07:19.180]   We now know.
[01:07:19.180 --> 01:07:20.740]   You should be key on your chest.
[01:07:20.740 --> 01:07:22.060]   In the Google world.
[01:07:22.060 --> 01:07:23.380]   Googleman.
[01:07:23.380 --> 01:07:27.380]   So Googleman, what do you think of the daily dying?
[01:07:27.380 --> 01:07:28.820]   Ah.
[01:07:28.820 --> 01:07:30.420]   Well, so I wrote about that for the Guardian.
[01:07:30.420 --> 01:07:33.620]   I think that it was the result of a few things.
[01:07:33.620 --> 01:07:35.540]   One was, yes, a pay wall.
[01:07:35.540 --> 01:07:37.740]   I did the numbers as best I could when it launched.
[01:07:37.740 --> 01:07:40.580]   And I figured that they would need a million subs
[01:07:40.580 --> 01:07:42.500]   to break even on their operating costs.
[01:07:42.500 --> 01:07:45.180]   They suppose it spent $30 million developing.
[01:07:45.180 --> 01:07:46.540]   I don't understand how.
[01:07:46.540 --> 01:07:49.140]   They had a $500,000 a week run rate at the beginning.
[01:07:49.140 --> 01:07:51.660]   So on that basis, I did some calculations of churn
[01:07:51.660 --> 01:07:53.580]   and the percentage to Apple and all that.
[01:07:53.580 --> 01:07:55.260]   So I said, 80% a million.
[01:07:55.260 --> 01:07:58.260]   Merck at the time said they were going to sell millions.
[01:07:58.260 --> 01:08:00.060]   They sold $100,000.
[01:08:00.060 --> 01:08:01.220]   Not even close.
[01:08:01.220 --> 01:08:03.220]   Not even close.
[01:08:03.220 --> 01:08:04.380]   So that's the number one problem.
[01:08:04.380 --> 01:08:09.620]   Number two problem was that it was daily.
[01:08:09.620 --> 01:08:10.620]   How stupid is that?
[01:08:10.620 --> 01:08:12.140]   News doesn't have to be daily anymore.
[01:08:12.140 --> 01:08:12.740]   It's ridiculous.
[01:08:12.740 --> 01:08:13.740]   It's all the time.
[01:08:13.740 --> 01:08:15.260]   And it's not saying it should be weekly.
[01:08:15.260 --> 01:08:16.500]   You're saying it's 24/7.
[01:08:16.500 --> 01:08:17.620]   It's constant.
[01:08:17.620 --> 01:08:19.940]   And then the third problem is that they would
[01:08:19.940 --> 01:08:23.340]   expand and pass the iPad to iPhones and to Android.
[01:08:23.340 --> 01:08:26.820]   But only if you were on Verizon.
[01:08:26.820 --> 01:08:29.340]   It was this ridiculous thing I see happening
[01:08:29.340 --> 01:08:30.340]   in media business.
[01:08:30.340 --> 01:08:31.540]   And we have to have a mobile strategy.
[01:08:31.540 --> 01:08:32.340]   No, you don't.
[01:08:32.340 --> 01:08:34.100]   You have to have a relationship strategy with people
[01:08:34.100 --> 01:08:36.420]   and you serve them well wherever they are, whatever they're
[01:08:36.420 --> 01:08:36.780]   doing.
[01:08:36.780 --> 01:08:38.820]   And if you change that a bit because they're using
[01:08:38.820 --> 01:08:40.020]   different device, fine.
[01:08:40.020 --> 01:08:42.380]   But this idea that we're going to do something different
[01:08:42.380 --> 01:08:44.340]   for the iPad is insane.
[01:08:44.340 --> 01:08:46.500]   And I hope it's a lesson that publishers have learned.
[01:08:46.500 --> 01:08:51.140]   So Merck treated the paywall as religious zealotry.
[01:08:51.140 --> 01:08:53.100]   And there's no God.
[01:08:53.100 --> 01:08:54.740]   Yeah.
[01:08:54.740 --> 01:08:58.140]   John Gruber also said it was just crapily implemented.
[01:08:58.140 --> 01:08:59.620]   It took too long to download.
[01:08:59.620 --> 01:09:00.740]   It was slow.
[01:09:00.740 --> 01:09:01.780]   It was decent looking.
[01:09:01.780 --> 01:09:06.420]   But the problem was that the content was commodity.
[01:09:06.420 --> 01:09:06.940]   It was news.
[01:09:06.940 --> 01:09:07.780]   There's plenty of news.
[01:09:07.780 --> 01:09:09.260]   Right.
[01:09:09.260 --> 01:09:10.220]   Nothing special about it.
[01:09:10.220 --> 01:09:12.380]   And perhaps it was insufficiently targeted.
[01:09:12.380 --> 01:09:17.060]   It was too generic.
[01:09:17.060 --> 01:09:17.700]   Yeah.
[01:09:17.700 --> 01:09:22.580]   That's how we differentiate by targeting, by serving
[01:09:22.580 --> 01:09:24.900]   a specific niche.
[01:09:24.900 --> 01:09:27.380]   If you're serving the USA Today niche, that's not much
[01:09:27.380 --> 01:09:28.380]   of a niche.
[01:09:28.380 --> 01:09:30.700]   And Larry Kramer, who is the publisher of USA Today
[01:09:30.700 --> 01:09:32.740]   and quite experienced, he started MarketWatch
[01:09:32.740 --> 01:09:34.500]   and all kinds of big stuff.
[01:09:34.500 --> 01:09:37.180]   Larry said last week that he cannot--
[01:09:37.180 --> 01:09:39.260]   he was butchering grammar, but we'll give it to him here.
[01:09:39.260 --> 01:09:40.180]   He's made a good point.
[01:09:40.180 --> 01:09:42.700]   He said that he could not charge for USA Today online
[01:09:42.700 --> 01:09:44.340]   because it's not unique enough.
[01:09:44.340 --> 01:09:45.180]   Exactly.
[01:09:45.180 --> 01:09:45.700]   Exactly.
[01:09:45.700 --> 01:09:47.660]   That's true.
[01:09:47.660 --> 01:09:49.820]   Boy, that's pretty insightful of Larry.
[01:09:49.820 --> 01:09:50.340]   That's Larry.
[01:09:50.340 --> 01:09:52.580]   Larry's smart guy.
[01:09:52.580 --> 01:09:54.700]   Jason Kaki did a post on his site
[01:09:54.700 --> 01:09:57.060]   a trend alert about small internet publications,
[01:09:57.060 --> 01:10:00.180]   like the magazine and the all just started--
[01:10:00.180 --> 01:10:02.300]   just released weekend companion, which is basically
[01:10:02.300 --> 01:10:03.580]   the other thing in my new stand.
[01:10:03.580 --> 01:10:04.580]   I'm subscribed to the magazine.
[01:10:04.580 --> 01:10:08.140]   I'm subscribed to a weekend companion, just like a few bucks
[01:10:08.140 --> 01:10:10.140]   a month or so.
[01:10:10.140 --> 01:10:11.140]   And it's interesting.
[01:10:11.140 --> 01:10:14.060]   I think it is working for some people.
[01:10:14.060 --> 01:10:15.380]   You know, we have these kind of--
[01:10:15.380 --> 01:10:18.340]   What's Marco doing with the magazine?
[01:10:18.340 --> 01:10:19.300]   Apparently, really well.
[01:10:19.300 --> 01:10:20.780]   I mean, he just hired an executive editor.
[01:10:20.780 --> 01:10:22.300]   He raised writer's rates, and he's
[01:10:22.300 --> 01:10:24.300]   doing more stories per issue.
[01:10:24.300 --> 01:10:29.420]   So I think that the revenue greatly exceeded his expectations.
[01:10:29.420 --> 01:10:31.460]   Because it has many of the flaws the Daily did.
[01:10:31.460 --> 01:10:33.220]   It's a walled garden.
[01:10:33.220 --> 01:10:34.220]   It's my pad only.
[01:10:34.220 --> 01:10:34.660]   Yeah, it's a new stand up.
[01:10:34.660 --> 01:10:35.620]   It's a new stand up.
[01:10:35.620 --> 01:10:36.140]   Yeah.
[01:10:36.140 --> 01:10:36.660]   Yeah.
[01:10:36.660 --> 01:10:38.100]   On the other hand, it's not heavy.
[01:10:38.100 --> 01:10:39.620]   It downloads quickly.
[01:10:39.620 --> 01:10:40.620]   Downloads very quickly.
[01:10:40.620 --> 01:10:41.700]   And there's no images.
[01:10:41.700 --> 01:10:42.780]   It's not a lot of flash.
[01:10:42.780 --> 01:10:46.660]   It's just basically text and links.
[01:10:46.660 --> 01:10:48.420]   But it's done really well.
[01:10:48.420 --> 01:10:51.460]   But Marco has a pretty big audience of people
[01:10:51.460 --> 01:10:54.100]   who love to read long form stripped down.
[01:10:54.100 --> 01:10:56.100]   He created instant paper.
[01:10:56.100 --> 01:10:56.620]   Right.
[01:10:56.620 --> 01:10:58.220]   So he had that.
[01:10:58.220 --> 01:10:59.900]   And the all.
[01:10:59.900 --> 01:11:02.700]   Theall.com, I don't have time to read it during the week,
[01:11:02.700 --> 01:11:03.260]   honestly.
[01:11:03.260 --> 01:11:05.500]   But I know there's some great writing going on there.
[01:11:05.500 --> 01:11:07.900]   So I subscribe to their iPad app.
[01:11:07.900 --> 01:11:09.420]   It's just a weekend companion.
[01:11:09.420 --> 01:11:11.260]   And it's like, oh, this is worth it to me.
[01:11:11.260 --> 01:11:14.260]   I get to see you kind of the best articles from this website
[01:11:14.260 --> 01:11:16.060]   that I may have missed during the week.
[01:11:16.060 --> 01:11:17.500]   But how many of those would you subscribe?
[01:11:17.500 --> 01:11:18.020]   I guess.
[01:11:18.020 --> 01:11:18.540]   I actually--
[01:11:18.540 --> 01:11:19.220]   Oh, no.
[01:11:19.220 --> 01:11:21.500]   You subscribe to many magazines, probably.
[01:11:21.500 --> 01:11:21.700]   Yeah.
[01:11:21.700 --> 01:11:22.420]   I mean, it's right.
[01:11:22.420 --> 01:11:24.420]   There's many magazines as I'd subscribe to,
[01:11:24.420 --> 01:11:26.260]   if it were 20 years ago.
[01:11:26.260 --> 01:11:27.540]   So what is theall?
[01:11:27.540 --> 01:11:29.620]   AWL?
[01:11:29.620 --> 01:11:33.300]   Besides a thing that punches hole and leather?
[01:11:33.300 --> 01:11:34.300]   Yeah.
[01:11:34.300 --> 01:11:38.060]   It's a website started by Corey Seeker, formerly of Gawker.
[01:11:38.060 --> 01:11:39.460]   It's kind of--
[01:11:39.460 --> 01:11:41.460]   it's the sister site to the wire cutter, which
[01:11:41.460 --> 01:11:43.140]   you've heard of.
[01:11:43.140 --> 01:11:43.660]   There's a few.
[01:11:43.660 --> 01:11:46.420]   There's the hairpin, the wire cutter, the all.
[01:11:46.420 --> 01:11:47.420]   You get them.
[01:11:47.420 --> 01:11:52.860]   These are all tools for making stuff.
[01:11:52.860 --> 01:11:53.180]   Right.
[01:11:53.180 --> 01:11:54.180]   Exactly.
[01:11:54.180 --> 01:11:54.860]   And--
[01:11:54.860 --> 01:11:55.660]   I love wire cutter.
[01:11:55.660 --> 01:11:57.460]   This is Brian Lamb's--
[01:11:57.460 --> 01:11:58.140]   Lamb's site.
[01:11:58.140 --> 01:11:58.620]   Lamb's site.
[01:11:58.620 --> 01:11:59.120]   Lamb's site.
[01:11:59.120 --> 01:11:59.620]   Lamb's site.
[01:11:59.620 --> 01:12:00.140]   Lamb's site.
[01:12:00.140 --> 01:12:01.140]   Lamb's site.
[01:12:01.140 --> 01:12:02.140]   Lamb's site.
[01:12:02.140 --> 01:12:03.140]   Lamb's site.
[01:12:03.140 --> 01:12:04.140]   Lamb's site.
[01:12:04.140 --> 01:12:05.140]   Lamb's site.
[01:12:05.140 --> 01:12:06.620]   She does jealous.
[01:12:06.620 --> 01:12:07.900]   She was reggae.
[01:12:07.900 --> 01:12:08.540]   Lamb's site.
[01:12:08.540 --> 01:12:09.060]   Lamb's site.
[01:12:09.060 --> 01:12:09.560]   Lamb's site.
[01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:10.060]   Lamb's site.
[01:12:10.060 --> 01:12:10.560]   Lamb's site.
[01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:11.060]   Lamb's site.
[01:12:11.060 --> 01:12:11.580]   Lamb's site.
[01:12:11.580 --> 01:12:12.100]   Lamb's site.
[01:12:12.100 --> 01:12:13.100]   Lamb's site.
[01:12:13.100 --> 01:12:13.940]   Lamb's site.
[01:12:13.940 --> 01:12:15.340]   How the hell's going on?
[01:12:15.340 --> 01:12:16.940]   Lamb's site.
[01:12:16.940 --> 01:12:17.940]   What?
[01:12:17.940 --> 01:12:19.940]   This happened on--
[01:12:19.940 --> 01:12:20.660]   all about Android.
[01:12:20.660 --> 01:12:21.380]   She's OK.
[01:12:21.380 --> 01:12:22.620]   Yeah, Gina doesn't--
[01:12:22.620 --> 01:12:25.020]   I think she's lost all hearing.
[01:12:25.020 --> 01:12:29.660]   Gina, if you could just plug and unplug your USB--
[01:12:29.660 --> 01:12:32.700]   for us, we're getting a dubstep remix of--
[01:12:32.700 --> 01:12:33.200]   I'm site.
[01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:33.700]   I'm site.
[01:12:33.700 --> 01:12:34.200]   I'm site.
[01:12:34.200 --> 01:12:34.700]   I'm site.
[01:12:34.700 --> 01:12:35.700]   I'm site.
[01:12:35.700 --> 01:12:36.200]   I'm site.
[01:12:36.200 --> 01:12:37.900]   So if you can just unplug and re--
[01:12:37.900 --> 01:12:39.380]   oh, yeah, that was fixing.
[01:12:39.380 --> 01:12:40.700]   I don't know if that's going to fix it.
[01:12:40.700 --> 01:12:42.340]   That was really unplugging it.
[01:12:42.340 --> 01:12:43.380]   Yeah, I don't know if that's going to--
[01:12:43.380 --> 01:12:45.340]   She may not be able to hear us now.
[01:12:45.340 --> 01:12:45.900]   Let's take a--
[01:12:45.900 --> 01:12:47.380]   Well, no, she's offline, isn't she?
[01:12:47.380 --> 01:12:48.100]   Oh, no, she's still there.
[01:12:48.100 --> 01:12:50.940]   No, no, I mean, before when I was talking to her,
[01:12:50.940 --> 01:12:54.140]   her interface may have died.
[01:12:54.140 --> 01:12:57.300]   Let's play a little reggae while we're waiting for the--
[01:12:57.300 --> 01:13:01.540]   The Lystolus Schutzrecht.
[01:13:01.540 --> 01:13:08.460]   Coming a little later on, the Schutzrecht.
[01:13:08.460 --> 01:13:12.900]   Harper Reed, who is not a werewolf.
[01:13:12.900 --> 01:13:14.100]   The Lystolus Schutz--
[01:13:14.100 --> 01:13:17.700]   Actually, he was President Obama's CTO in the 2012 election.
[01:13:17.700 --> 01:13:18.980]   The Lystolus Schutzrecht.
[01:13:18.980 --> 01:13:24.820]   Or a CTO of the Redless.
[01:13:24.820 --> 01:13:27.220]   The Schutzrecht.
[01:13:27.220 --> 01:13:30.660]   He helped design and test narwhal.
[01:13:30.660 --> 01:13:32.260]   The Lystolus Schutzrecht.
[01:13:32.260 --> 01:13:33.940]   Which was the--
[01:13:33.940 --> 01:13:35.300]   Get out the vote application.
[01:13:35.300 --> 01:13:35.860]   Schutzrecht.
[01:13:35.860 --> 01:13:38.900]   Many credit, at least partially credit up all this real.
[01:13:38.900 --> 01:13:40.100]   The Lystolus Schutzrecht.
[01:13:40.100 --> 01:13:45.580]   The Lystolus Schutzrecht.
[01:13:45.580 --> 01:13:47.340]   Where's a bong when I need one?
[01:13:47.340 --> 01:13:48.340]   The Lystolus Schutzrecht.
[01:13:48.340 --> 01:13:55.980]   I think there's some blunts in the lower left hand--
[01:13:55.980 --> 01:13:58.060]   The Lystolus Schutzrecht.
[01:13:58.060 --> 01:13:58.900]   There might be--
[01:13:58.900 --> 01:13:59.900]   No.
[01:13:59.900 --> 01:14:00.900]   No.
[01:14:00.900 --> 01:14:01.400]   No.
[01:14:01.400 --> 01:14:03.620]   Thank you, Hana's Schlieck.
[01:14:03.620 --> 01:14:06.740]   I have a feeling she rebooted because she left chat.
[01:14:06.740 --> 01:14:07.260]   She's gone.
[01:14:07.260 --> 01:14:08.180]   And is offline.
[01:14:08.180 --> 01:14:09.900]   She's gone.
[01:14:09.900 --> 01:14:11.420]   By the way, I do like the wire cutter.
[01:14:11.420 --> 01:14:12.380]   I've used it a couple times.
[01:14:12.380 --> 01:14:17.220]   The whole idea of the wire cutter is like the best.
[01:14:17.220 --> 01:14:18.580]   And it's like in a lot of categories.
[01:14:18.580 --> 01:14:21.020]   So like, what's the best water bottle?
[01:14:21.020 --> 01:14:22.660]   What's the best small TV?
[01:14:22.660 --> 01:14:24.580]   What's the best SD card?
[01:14:24.580 --> 01:14:28.380]   And Brian Lam, who was founder-- or at least editor
[01:14:28.380 --> 01:14:30.860]   at Gizmodo.
[01:14:30.860 --> 01:14:33.460]   As far as I know, at least initially, this was him alone.
[01:14:33.460 --> 01:14:35.700]   I think it looks like maybe there's others doing it now.
[01:14:35.700 --> 01:14:38.100]   But it's a great idea because I think people just want to say,
[01:14:38.100 --> 01:14:39.340]   what's the best?
[01:14:39.340 --> 01:14:40.380]   I don't need all the review.
[01:14:40.380 --> 01:14:42.700]   There's different approaches to this.
[01:14:42.700 --> 01:14:46.300]   Like Gadget has like, well, they aggregate every review,
[01:14:46.300 --> 01:14:49.700]   and then they have user reviews, and then they make a score.
[01:14:49.700 --> 01:14:51.580]   This is just like, no, you don't need all that.
[01:14:51.580 --> 01:14:54.980]   Just buy the MacBook here or the MacBook Pro Red.
[01:14:54.980 --> 01:14:56.860]   And actually, I've gone through this.
[01:14:56.860 --> 01:15:01.140]   And in most cases, I think they're absolutely right.
[01:15:01.140 --> 01:15:05.980]   The best big screen TV.
[01:15:05.980 --> 01:15:06.780]   Sorry about that.
[01:15:06.780 --> 01:15:07.420]   That's OK.
[01:15:07.420 --> 01:15:10.780]   I was just going through the wire cutter
[01:15:10.780 --> 01:15:12.180]   because I love it.
[01:15:12.180 --> 01:15:14.900]   Panasonic ST50.
[01:15:14.900 --> 01:15:18.020]   I actually have a VT50, and I rave about it.
[01:15:18.020 --> 01:15:21.420]   I think actually the GT50 is the best.
[01:15:21.420 --> 01:15:23.020]   No, no, the ST50 is the flagship.
[01:15:23.020 --> 01:15:23.980]   So everybody agrees.
[01:15:23.980 --> 01:15:27.060]   This is the best big screen TV.
[01:15:27.060 --> 01:15:28.460]   So it's stuff like that.
[01:15:28.460 --> 01:15:30.740]   I think it's just great.
[01:15:30.740 --> 01:15:32.980]   What's the best iPhone 5 case?
[01:15:32.980 --> 01:15:35.300]   What's the best Wi-Fi hotspot?
[01:15:35.300 --> 01:15:39.260]   What's the best sports camera?
[01:15:39.260 --> 01:15:40.260]   So that's the wire cutter.
[01:15:40.260 --> 01:15:41.100]   And then the hairpin.
[01:15:41.100 --> 01:15:41.900]   What is that for?
[01:15:41.900 --> 01:15:43.820]   Is that for?
[01:15:43.820 --> 01:15:45.380]   I think it's a women's sight.
[01:15:45.380 --> 01:15:47.980]   Oh, I don't want that.
[01:15:47.980 --> 01:15:51.260]   I'm afraid that'll rub off.
[01:15:51.260 --> 01:15:52.380]   Kooties, you know.
[01:15:52.380 --> 01:15:53.220]   Kooties.
[01:15:53.220 --> 01:15:55.940]   And then splits insider.
[01:15:55.940 --> 01:15:57.340]   Split-sider.
[01:15:57.340 --> 01:15:59.740]   Is that comedy?
[01:15:59.740 --> 01:16:00.900]   Oh, that's a new one on me.
[01:16:00.900 --> 01:16:02.300]   Split-sider.
[01:16:02.300 --> 01:16:03.180]   Yeah, it must be comedy.
[01:16:03.180 --> 01:16:04.260]   Yeah, it's comedy.
[01:16:04.260 --> 01:16:05.500]   The bill fold.
[01:16:05.500 --> 01:16:07.900]   The bill fold is that about money?
[01:16:07.900 --> 01:16:09.220]   Money?
[01:16:09.220 --> 01:16:10.380]   Yeah, cool.
[01:16:10.380 --> 01:16:12.740]   So this is like a network, a blog network.
[01:16:12.740 --> 01:16:13.540]   Yeah, yep.
[01:16:13.540 --> 01:16:14.380]   This is a blog network.
[01:16:14.380 --> 01:16:16.620]   But with some real interesting style, yeah, everything--
[01:16:16.620 --> 01:16:20.820]   Corey Seikas, a guy with a lot of style.
[01:16:20.820 --> 01:16:21.940]   I like it.
[01:16:21.940 --> 01:16:24.180]   His attitude, his smart--
[01:16:24.180 --> 01:16:27.220]   And there's no gossip.
[01:16:27.220 --> 01:16:29.220]   Oh, Corey does gossip on the all, on me?
[01:16:29.220 --> 01:16:31.500]   Yeah, yeah, the all is a bit gossipy.
[01:16:31.500 --> 01:16:32.460]   It's a kind of-- I don't know.
[01:16:32.460 --> 01:16:35.660]   Imagine the hell to be a slightly more evolved gocker,
[01:16:35.660 --> 01:16:37.420]   so for what that's worth.
[01:16:37.420 --> 01:16:37.900]   Oh, yeah.
[01:16:37.900 --> 01:16:39.540]   It's what you wanted gocker to be.
[01:16:39.540 --> 01:16:40.380]   Interesting.
[01:16:40.380 --> 01:16:42.500]   Yeah, because Corey started a gocker.
[01:16:42.500 --> 01:16:43.340]   Interesting.
[01:16:43.340 --> 01:16:47.020]   Corey was actually my mentor when I started Life Hacker.
[01:16:47.020 --> 01:16:51.420]   15 of our favorite things set on reality TV.
[01:16:51.420 --> 01:16:52.980]   Well, actually, that's an ad.
[01:16:52.980 --> 01:16:54.380]   The best off-- oh, so some of this
[01:16:54.380 --> 01:16:57.180]   is from other stories.
[01:16:57.180 --> 01:16:59.460]   Famous people who were or planned
[01:16:59.460 --> 01:17:03.020]   to be in other Hobbit movies.
[01:17:03.020 --> 01:17:05.620]   That's my kind of gossip.
[01:17:05.620 --> 01:17:08.100]   So the Weekend Companion is this iPad app
[01:17:08.100 --> 01:17:11.580]   that 29 Street Publishing, which is David Jacobs Company,
[01:17:11.580 --> 01:17:12.060]   built.
[01:17:12.060 --> 01:17:15.220]   They have this framework for making iPad newsstand apps,
[01:17:15.220 --> 01:17:17.380]   and they license it out to the all.
[01:17:17.380 --> 01:17:19.860]   They also licensed up to another company
[01:17:19.860 --> 01:17:22.540]   for this iPad magazine app.
[01:17:22.540 --> 01:17:24.100]   And it's actually-- it's really nicely done.
[01:17:24.100 --> 01:17:27.140]   And it's similar to the magazine, costs a little more.
[01:17:27.140 --> 01:17:30.020]   I think it's like four bucks a month or something.
[01:17:30.020 --> 01:17:31.220]   Slightly different approach.
[01:17:31.220 --> 01:17:33.460]   The magazine, you get all the back issues for free.
[01:17:33.460 --> 01:17:35.460]   With the Weekend Companion, you have
[01:17:35.460 --> 01:17:37.820]   to pay it to two bucks to read a back issue.
[01:17:37.820 --> 01:17:39.820]   It's so funny, because this is such a forward thinking
[01:17:39.820 --> 01:17:41.380]   hipster kind of website.
[01:17:41.380 --> 01:17:42.740]   This seems like such an old model.
[01:17:42.740 --> 01:17:44.180]   It seems like they're going to--
[01:17:44.180 --> 01:17:45.780]   I want to be the New York-- right, Jeff?
[01:17:45.780 --> 01:17:48.340]   This is-- well, that's what Nick Denton always said to me.
[01:17:48.340 --> 01:17:49.740]   He wanted to be sign new house.
[01:17:49.740 --> 01:17:51.740]   He went inside 17 magazines.
[01:17:51.740 --> 01:17:53.700]   He wanted 17 blogs.
[01:17:53.700 --> 01:17:57.100]   But making him an iPad app, and basically
[01:17:57.100 --> 01:17:58.900]   effectively a walled garden--
[01:17:58.900 --> 01:17:59.660]   I agree.
[01:17:59.660 --> 01:18:00.660]   I'm not a fan of it.
[01:18:00.660 --> 01:18:03.140]   I really-- I mean, I love the site.
[01:18:03.140 --> 01:18:06.340]   What is the advantage from you as a user?
[01:18:06.340 --> 01:18:07.780]   What is the advantage?
[01:18:07.780 --> 01:18:09.420]   Well, of course, when he introduced it,
[01:18:09.420 --> 01:18:12.700]   it's like you want to be able to kind of curl up
[01:18:12.700 --> 01:18:16.900]   with a long form article and read it not on your computer
[01:18:16.900 --> 01:18:18.780]   screen when you're sitting at your desk at work.
[01:18:18.780 --> 01:18:21.420]   But it's the weekend and you're flipping through the paper
[01:18:21.420 --> 01:18:21.980]   kind of thing.
[01:18:21.980 --> 01:18:24.740]   So it's just kind of a more relaxed, different reading
[01:18:24.740 --> 01:18:27.300]   experience, particularly for long form content.
[01:18:27.300 --> 01:18:29.700]   This is why I send stuff into paper.
[01:18:29.700 --> 01:18:32.340]   This is why I really enjoy the New York Times iPad app,
[01:18:32.340 --> 01:18:33.180]   for example.
[01:18:33.180 --> 01:18:35.100]   I like reading long form stuff on my iPad.
[01:18:35.100 --> 01:18:36.420]   This is a different experience.
[01:18:36.420 --> 01:18:37.260]   It's more relaxing.
[01:18:37.260 --> 01:18:38.180]   It's a touch screen thing.
[01:18:38.180 --> 01:18:39.180]   It's in my hands.
[01:18:39.180 --> 01:18:41.580]   It has that kind of old school reading the paper,
[01:18:41.580 --> 01:18:42.860]   kind of feeling to it.
[01:18:42.860 --> 01:18:45.340]   And for me, it's like the all probably publishes
[01:18:45.340 --> 01:18:46.940]   dozens of posts a day.
[01:18:46.940 --> 01:18:49.700]   And I want just the best stuff from the week
[01:18:49.700 --> 01:18:51.220]   in a very readable format.
[01:18:51.220 --> 01:18:54.540]   And that's the-- and that's similar to the magazine.
[01:18:54.540 --> 01:18:58.420]   It's like just good long stories that maybe published on blogs
[01:18:58.420 --> 01:18:59.940]   later or may have been published on blogs,
[01:18:59.940 --> 01:19:00.980]   but curated and edited.
[01:19:00.980 --> 01:19:02.660]   And I know it's kind of old school, right?
[01:19:02.660 --> 01:19:04.180]   It's very old school.
[01:19:04.180 --> 01:19:05.460]   I'm too ADD.
[01:19:05.460 --> 01:19:08.380]   I want to be able to flip around.
[01:19:08.380 --> 01:19:11.300]   I don't want to live in one thing.
[01:19:11.300 --> 01:19:12.740]   So it's just not for me.
[01:19:12.740 --> 01:19:13.700]   Yeah, you're right.
[01:19:13.700 --> 01:19:15.300]   You know what we forgot?
[01:19:15.300 --> 01:19:16.340]   Yes, we did.
[01:19:16.340 --> 01:19:19.300]   Let's play some trumpets.
[01:19:19.300 --> 01:19:21.100]   The Google Change Law--
[01:19:21.100 --> 01:19:24.180]   Ladies and gentlemen, each week, Gina Trepene,
[01:19:24.180 --> 01:19:26.340]   tells us what's new with Google.
[01:19:26.340 --> 01:19:30.180]   Big launch this week.
[01:19:30.180 --> 01:19:31.860]   Gmail for iOS got a--
[01:19:31.860 --> 01:19:33.180]   Yeah!
[01:19:33.180 --> 01:19:33.700]   --update.
[01:19:33.700 --> 01:19:34.580]   Have you gotten this, Leo?
[01:19:34.580 --> 01:19:35.980]   Yeah.
[01:19:35.980 --> 01:19:37.580]   Yeah, awesome.
[01:19:37.580 --> 01:19:38.620]   Awesome.
[01:19:38.620 --> 01:19:39.900]   Wild back.
[01:19:39.900 --> 01:19:41.820]   So it's very sparrow-esque.
[01:19:41.820 --> 01:19:44.620]   The update got multiple account support.
[01:19:44.620 --> 01:19:46.580]   For those of us with multiple Google accounts--
[01:19:46.580 --> 01:19:48.580]   again, Gmail for iOS.
[01:19:48.580 --> 01:19:50.820]   You get an infinitely scrolling inbox.
[01:19:50.820 --> 01:19:52.580]   You don't have to tap load more messages,
[01:19:52.580 --> 01:19:54.180]   which is annoying when you go down.
[01:19:54.180 --> 01:19:57.740]   Search predictions as you type a very clean, white redesign,
[01:19:57.740 --> 01:20:01.300]   and interactive replies to Google Calendar and Google Plus
[01:20:01.300 --> 01:20:03.860]   email notifications right from your inbox.
[01:20:03.860 --> 01:20:05.100]   So really nice update.
[01:20:05.100 --> 01:20:07.820]   In fact, the Verge did a kind of hands-on with it.
[01:20:07.820 --> 01:20:09.660]   And they said, you know, it's a little stuttery.
[01:20:09.660 --> 01:20:10.820]   It's a lot better than it was.
[01:20:10.820 --> 01:20:11.660]   A little stuttery.
[01:20:11.660 --> 01:20:12.500]   Could use a little work.
[01:20:12.500 --> 01:20:14.260]   But I have to tell you, I really enjoyed it.
[01:20:14.260 --> 01:20:16.060]   When are they going to put it on Android?
[01:20:16.060 --> 01:20:17.900]   That's bizarre to me.
[01:20:17.900 --> 01:20:20.900]   I feel like Gmail got a recent update on Android.
[01:20:20.900 --> 01:20:21.980]   I think it was just a minor.
[01:20:21.980 --> 01:20:24.100]   I think it was just a minor bug fixate type thing.
[01:20:24.100 --> 01:20:26.380]   Maybe it has all those features and I just didn't notice.
[01:20:26.380 --> 01:20:28.540]   I mean, I've always thought that Gmail and Android
[01:20:28.540 --> 01:20:29.980]   is so much better experience than iOS.
[01:20:29.980 --> 01:20:30.980]   Yeah, I think it is.
[01:20:30.980 --> 01:20:31.180]   Yeah.
[01:20:31.180 --> 01:20:33.180]   Makes sense, right?
[01:20:33.180 --> 01:20:37.220]   YouTube for iOS also got updated for-- with iPad support,
[01:20:37.220 --> 01:20:41.460]   iPhone 5 support, AirPlay, and performance improvements.
[01:20:41.460 --> 01:20:43.860]   So you can stream videos with AirPlay to your Apple TV
[01:20:43.860 --> 01:20:46.380]   through the YouTube app on iOS.
[01:20:46.380 --> 01:20:47.420]   Nice.
[01:20:47.420 --> 01:20:51.540]   Google Now for Android got an update, brings boarding passes
[01:20:51.540 --> 01:20:52.740]   and song IDs.
[01:20:52.740 --> 01:20:55.260]   So when you're traveling, that's holiday season.
[01:20:55.260 --> 01:20:58.500]   This is actually straight from the Google Android blog.
[01:20:58.500 --> 01:21:00.020]   Before you leave your house, Google Now
[01:21:00.020 --> 01:21:02.220]   will tell you what the weather will be like at your destination.
[01:21:02.220 --> 01:21:04.220]   This is when you've got a flight planned.
[01:21:04.220 --> 01:21:06.620]   Just in time to make sure you remember to pack those mittens.
[01:21:06.620 --> 01:21:08.020]   At the airport, your boarding pass
[01:21:08.020 --> 01:21:10.820]   will automatically get pulled up, helping
[01:21:10.820 --> 01:21:11.900]   you breeze through the gate.
[01:21:11.900 --> 01:21:14.500]   And this is launching shortly for United Airlines only
[01:21:14.500 --> 01:21:17.060]   with more airlines to come.
[01:21:17.060 --> 01:21:20.180]   And once you've flown and arrived at your destination,
[01:21:20.180 --> 01:21:22.700]   Google Now will help you uncover great activities,
[01:21:22.700 --> 01:21:24.060]   showing you events happening around you.
[01:21:24.060 --> 01:21:27.780]   This is all similar to what it does now, suggesting websites.
[01:21:27.780 --> 01:21:30.580]   For you to explore, you worked your research things to do.
[01:21:30.580 --> 01:21:34.580]   And Google Voice Search now just got what's the song, right?
[01:21:34.580 --> 01:21:36.900]   So you guys have seen on Android, there's that widget now.
[01:21:36.900 --> 01:21:38.020]   The what's the song widget.
[01:21:38.020 --> 01:21:39.700]   If you're listening to a song, you just tap it
[01:21:39.700 --> 01:21:41.260]   and it'll identify the song.
[01:21:41.260 --> 01:21:43.220]   You can add Google Voice Search.
[01:21:43.220 --> 01:21:44.900]   It's like Shazam.
[01:21:44.900 --> 01:21:45.540]   Shazam, exactly.
[01:21:45.540 --> 01:21:47.980]   So if I do a voice search and I just play a song into it,
[01:21:47.980 --> 01:21:49.340]   it should know the song?
[01:21:49.340 --> 01:21:49.980]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:21:49.980 --> 01:21:51.100]   I'll tell you what the song is.
[01:21:51.100 --> 01:21:54.620]   Try to license it and shoot the rectus on that.
[01:21:54.620 --> 01:21:56.580]   Should I go ahead and play the--
[01:21:56.580 --> 01:21:57.580]   do you have that?
[01:21:57.580 --> 01:21:59.900]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:21:59.900 --> 01:22:01.260]   Wouldn't it be funny if you found it?
[01:22:01.260 --> 01:22:07.540]   So I don't need the widget anymore.
[01:22:07.540 --> 01:22:08.220]   I don't need--
[01:22:08.220 --> 01:22:09.260]   I need Shazam anymore.
[01:22:09.260 --> 01:22:10.620]   I don't need--
[01:22:10.620 --> 01:22:11.620]   Research, yeah.
[01:22:11.620 --> 01:22:13.580]   What's the song?
[01:22:13.580 --> 01:22:16.180]   The Android 4.1 Jelly Bean update is now going out
[01:22:16.180 --> 01:22:19.420]   to AT&T Samsung Galaxy S3 users.
[01:22:19.420 --> 01:22:20.660]   I believe this is over the air.
[01:22:20.660 --> 01:22:21.620]   I don't have one of these.
[01:22:21.620 --> 01:22:22.540]   So I couldn't confirm.
[01:22:22.540 --> 01:22:24.060]   But someone on Twitter told me that it's
[01:22:24.060 --> 01:22:25.220]   going out over the air.
[01:22:25.220 --> 01:22:25.980]   So let me--
[01:22:25.980 --> 01:22:28.780]   I gave mine to Beara Tunday, so I can't tell you that.
[01:22:28.780 --> 01:22:30.660]   Oh, that's a good, that's a good gift.
[01:22:30.660 --> 01:22:31.620]   So it's pretty mobile.
[01:22:31.620 --> 01:22:34.300]   And now AT&T all are getting that update over the air
[01:22:34.300 --> 01:22:37.820]   to the Galaxy S3, still waiting on Verizon, although on that one.
[01:22:37.820 --> 01:22:38.740]   Jelly Bean's awesome.
[01:22:38.740 --> 01:22:39.580]   Get it.
[01:22:39.580 --> 01:22:40.740]   Yeah, the new Jelly Bean.
[01:22:40.740 --> 01:22:41.220]   Yeah.
[01:22:41.220 --> 01:22:42.380]   New flavor, Jelly Bean.
[01:22:42.380 --> 01:22:42.860]   New flavor.
[01:22:42.860 --> 01:22:44.620]   And finally, this is kind of developer specific,
[01:22:44.620 --> 01:22:46.300]   but I thought this was kind of interesting.
[01:22:46.300 --> 01:22:48.660]   Google Play comes to Google Apps.
[01:22:48.660 --> 01:22:51.820]   So Google Apps for your domain, that's kind of the old name,
[01:22:51.820 --> 01:22:53.860]   but I still use it because it's the only way to kind of help
[01:22:53.860 --> 01:22:55.860]   understand what you set up your Google Apps
[01:22:55.860 --> 01:22:57.860]   behind a certain domain.
[01:22:57.860 --> 01:23:01.420]   You get certain services-- Gmail, Docs, Drive,
[01:23:01.420 --> 01:23:02.940]   Drive, Calendar, et cetera.
[01:23:02.940 --> 01:23:06.700]   Now organizations who use Google Apps
[01:23:06.700 --> 01:23:09.940]   can set up a private channel in the Google Play store
[01:23:09.940 --> 01:23:13.500]   and distribute apps internally within their organization.
[01:23:13.500 --> 01:23:15.980]   So if you work at a company and there's
[01:23:15.980 --> 01:23:19.740]   an internal company-wide, internal company Android app,
[01:23:19.740 --> 01:23:22.380]   you can upload that app to this private channel
[01:23:22.380 --> 01:23:24.980]   on the Google Play store and distribute it just to your users,
[01:23:24.980 --> 01:23:26.060]   which is pretty neat.
[01:23:26.060 --> 01:23:27.780]   So this is Google Apps for business, education,
[01:23:27.780 --> 01:23:29.140]   and government domains.
[01:23:29.140 --> 01:23:32.980]   It can have a private channel on the Google Play store.
[01:23:32.980 --> 01:23:35.180]   Administrators allow users, must be on the same domain,
[01:23:35.180 --> 01:23:37.980]   to register with the Android Developer Console, who can turn,
[01:23:37.980 --> 01:23:40.140]   publish Android apps to the private channel.
[01:23:40.140 --> 01:23:41.180]   This is really neat.
[01:23:41.180 --> 01:23:42.340]   It was neat to me as a developer.
[01:23:42.340 --> 01:23:45.220]   I thought it was interesting just from the Android point of view.
[01:23:45.220 --> 01:23:48.900]   Right now, to test iOS apps, or to do internal iOS apps that
[01:23:48.900 --> 01:23:50.900]   are just for a certain number of people,
[01:23:50.900 --> 01:23:53.220]   it's a huge pain in the butt.
[01:23:53.220 --> 01:23:57.060]   So I really like the idea that organizations or companies
[01:23:57.060 --> 01:23:58.860]   or whatever would be making--
[01:23:58.860 --> 01:24:01.420]   so if you imagine if you have a conference or a university
[01:24:01.420 --> 01:24:03.660]   that there would be apps specific to that organization,
[01:24:03.660 --> 01:24:05.460]   you can distribute them through the Play store
[01:24:05.460 --> 01:24:07.820]   without making the public.
[01:24:07.820 --> 01:24:10.820]   Neat, that's really cool.
[01:24:10.820 --> 01:24:13.340]   Yeah, a lot so.
[01:24:13.340 --> 01:24:14.700]   So we're going to have to make it into--
[01:24:14.700 --> 01:24:18.460]   The change long--
[01:24:18.460 --> 01:24:19.220]   sorry.
[01:24:19.220 --> 01:24:20.220]   I didn't interrupt you.
[01:24:20.220 --> 01:24:23.820]   Chad did, but I went along with it.
[01:24:23.820 --> 01:24:24.860]   What were you saying?
[01:24:24.860 --> 01:24:25.360]   Good.
[01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:28.100]   I was going to say we're going to have to make a Twig host app.
[01:24:28.100 --> 01:24:29.980]   Oh, yeah.
[01:24:29.980 --> 01:24:31.500]   We could do that.
[01:24:31.500 --> 01:24:32.940]   I don't know what we'd put in it.
[01:24:32.940 --> 01:24:34.100]   Japan-Ya-Dorga.
[01:24:34.100 --> 01:24:36.740]   Shoots like in Fox and to Fox and--
[01:24:36.740 --> 01:24:38.500]   that's good.
[01:24:38.500 --> 01:24:39.820]   I can give you a regular--
[01:24:39.820 --> 01:24:41.820]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:24:41.820 --> 01:24:42.620]   Yeah, let's see.
[01:24:42.620 --> 01:24:46.500]   We're going to time for our tip number and tool of the week,
[01:24:46.500 --> 01:24:48.220]   and then we're going to get over to triangulation
[01:24:48.220 --> 01:24:51.100]   and Harper Reid, Gina Trappani.
[01:24:51.100 --> 01:24:52.300]   Oh, so a little tip this week.
[01:24:52.300 --> 01:24:53.220]   This is a new one on me.
[01:24:53.220 --> 01:24:55.780]   Google system-- Google operating system published this one.
[01:24:55.780 --> 01:24:59.020]   If you've enabled that experiment in Google search results
[01:24:59.020 --> 01:25:01.140]   that were-- includes your Gmail--
[01:25:01.140 --> 01:25:03.420]   it is in your search results.
[01:25:03.420 --> 01:25:07.180]   If you type the words My flights into Google, no quotes,
[01:25:07.180 --> 01:25:09.620]   you'll get flight tracking information for the flights
[01:25:09.620 --> 01:25:14.660]   that you have books based on your Gmail messages.
[01:25:14.660 --> 01:25:17.100]   And I'll even show reminders, like, hey, your flight's
[01:25:17.100 --> 01:25:18.900]   taking off a little later on.
[01:25:18.900 --> 01:25:21.980]   And that same notification that somebody's birthday
[01:25:21.980 --> 01:25:23.780]   on Google+.
[01:25:23.780 --> 01:25:26.780]   Yeah, so this is Google integrating all of our stuff
[01:25:26.780 --> 01:25:29.180]   and trying to figure out exactly what we're looking for.
[01:25:29.180 --> 01:25:31.660]   So yeah, just type-- before you fly this holiday season,
[01:25:31.660 --> 01:25:33.220]   I actually don't have any flights booked
[01:25:33.220 --> 01:25:34.700]   because the baby's just a little fly.
[01:25:34.700 --> 01:25:37.420]   But if you-- if you have flights booked to travel to the holidays,
[01:25:37.420 --> 01:25:38.780]   just type My flights into Google,
[01:25:38.780 --> 01:25:41.580]   and you'll be able to get information about where they're
[01:25:41.580 --> 01:25:43.460]   going and whether or not they're on time right from the search
[01:25:43.460 --> 01:25:44.460]   box.
[01:25:44.460 --> 01:25:45.900]   I guess I don't have any flights planned.
[01:25:45.900 --> 01:25:47.940]   I don't have anything in here.
[01:25:47.940 --> 01:25:49.020]   Tripit does that.
[01:25:49.020 --> 01:25:54.300]   I have Tripit scanning through my Gmail for upcoming travel.
[01:25:54.300 --> 01:25:55.300]   But--
[01:25:55.300 --> 01:25:58.340]   Is that going to freak people out?
[01:25:58.340 --> 01:25:59.740]   Is that what you're worried about?
[01:25:59.740 --> 01:26:01.100]   No, it freaks me out the Tripit thing.
[01:26:01.100 --> 01:26:02.420]   No, I think it's a great feature.
[01:26:02.420 --> 01:26:05.460]   But do I really want to open up all my email to anybody else?
[01:26:05.460 --> 01:26:06.620]   Oh, I do it all the time.
[01:26:06.620 --> 01:26:09.020]   No.
[01:26:09.020 --> 01:26:13.380]   Yeah, I-- there was an extension that connected to your Gmail
[01:26:13.380 --> 01:26:18.700]   account and scanned all your messages for names and addresses
[01:26:18.700 --> 01:26:20.460]   and phone numbers and would automatically
[01:26:20.460 --> 01:26:21.460]   populate your contacts.
[01:26:21.460 --> 01:26:22.460]   Yeah.
[01:26:22.460 --> 01:26:23.580]   You just have an idea.
[01:26:23.580 --> 01:26:24.620]   And I forget the name of it.
[01:26:24.620 --> 01:26:26.260]   I apologize to the developer.
[01:26:26.260 --> 01:26:28.380]   I just-- I can't bring myself to allow--
[01:26:28.380 --> 01:26:30.660]   No, that's the same problem I have.
[01:26:30.660 --> 01:26:33.100]   I just did something-- actually, it could be my tool.
[01:26:33.100 --> 01:26:34.540]   Well, go ahead.
[01:26:34.540 --> 01:26:35.740]   I know what you mean.
[01:26:35.740 --> 01:26:37.660]   I guess I just-- I don't know.
[01:26:37.660 --> 01:26:38.160]   I'm--
[01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:40.220]   Facebook, where is Google's already reading my email?
[01:26:40.220 --> 01:26:40.660]   So fine.
[01:26:40.660 --> 01:26:41.420]   Tell me about my flights.
[01:26:41.420 --> 01:26:42.580]   Thank you.
[01:26:42.580 --> 01:26:43.940]   Well, already has my Gmail exactly.
[01:26:43.940 --> 01:26:46.100]   So it's like, OK.
[01:26:46.100 --> 01:26:48.820]   There, anyway, I have no illusion that email is private.
[01:26:48.820 --> 01:26:51.260]   But I guess-- I don't know.
[01:26:51.260 --> 01:26:53.900]   Maybe I'm just trying to fool myself.
[01:26:53.900 --> 01:26:56.380]   I'll show you something that I just did that's exactly that.
[01:26:56.380 --> 01:27:00.420]   But first, Jeff, with the number of the week.
[01:27:00.420 --> 01:27:02.660]   All right, so I could be mentioning the 44 libraries
[01:27:02.660 --> 01:27:04.540]   in California now have free use of Chromebooks
[01:27:04.540 --> 01:27:05.300]   for their users.
[01:27:05.300 --> 01:27:06.060]   But I won't.
[01:27:06.060 --> 01:27:08.180]   I could be mentioning that Apple stock went down 6% today.
[01:27:08.180 --> 01:27:08.700]   But I won't.
[01:27:08.700 --> 01:27:11.140]   We don't know why.
[01:27:11.140 --> 01:27:12.220]   So what I will mention is--
[01:27:12.220 --> 01:27:14.300]   what I think is very cool is that Google
[01:27:14.300 --> 01:27:18.300]   has announced a $23 million set of grants
[01:27:18.300 --> 01:27:21.220]   under global impact awards to bring more technology
[01:27:21.220 --> 01:27:23.780]   innovation to nonprofits.
[01:27:23.780 --> 01:27:28.260]   And among the seven winners are is charity water,
[01:27:28.260 --> 01:27:31.460]   a consortium for the bar code of life, donors choose,
[01:27:31.460 --> 01:27:33.700]   which is charity I like a lot, where
[01:27:33.700 --> 01:27:36.140]   teachers can get people to give money for things
[01:27:36.140 --> 01:27:39.260]   they want to do, equal opportunity schools,
[01:27:39.260 --> 01:27:42.860]   give directly, world wildlife fund.
[01:27:42.860 --> 01:27:44.140]   And I didn't know this even existed.
[01:27:44.140 --> 01:27:47.660]   The Gina Davis Institute on Gender and Media.
[01:27:47.660 --> 01:27:48.060]   Oh, yeah.
[01:27:48.060 --> 01:27:49.060]   She's really into.
[01:27:49.060 --> 01:27:49.540]   She did it.
[01:27:49.540 --> 01:27:50.060]   Yeah.
[01:27:50.060 --> 01:27:50.540]   She went--
[01:27:50.540 --> 01:27:52.100]   Yeah, good for her.
[01:27:52.100 --> 01:27:53.060]   So that's kind of cool.
[01:27:53.060 --> 01:27:54.060]   It's a good list.
[01:27:54.060 --> 01:27:56.020]   $23 million went to these various places.
[01:27:56.020 --> 01:27:58.460]   And I thought, good for you, Google.
[01:27:58.460 --> 01:28:01.300]   I wrote a piece for my blog, actually,
[01:28:01.300 --> 01:28:01.900]   to start off with it.
[01:28:01.900 --> 01:28:03.300]   Maybe it turned in my pad.
[01:28:03.300 --> 01:28:07.580]   In this tax fight that's going on in the UK over Google,
[01:28:07.580 --> 01:28:11.220]   Facebook, and Google, Google, Starbucks, and Amazon.
[01:28:11.220 --> 01:28:13.300]   They're almost saying, well, you should just give more money.
[01:28:13.300 --> 01:28:15.340]   Even though what you do is legal, it's immoral.
[01:28:15.340 --> 01:28:17.420]   And Christian Frillan from Reuters
[01:28:17.420 --> 01:28:21.460]   had a piece this week from her book about rich people
[01:28:21.460 --> 01:28:23.300]   that they think that they should decide where
[01:28:23.300 --> 01:28:24.660]   to spend their money rather than taxes.
[01:28:24.660 --> 01:28:27.100]   And now that's basically the bill taking the government.
[01:28:27.100 --> 01:28:28.700]   That's exactly right.
[01:28:28.700 --> 01:28:29.740]   Anthony.
[01:28:29.740 --> 01:28:33.100]   And so what you have is you have Google basically
[01:28:33.100 --> 01:28:35.620]   taxing itself to give charity, reverse things,
[01:28:35.620 --> 01:28:36.620]   and doing a good job.
[01:28:36.620 --> 01:28:37.780]   So interesting.
[01:28:37.780 --> 01:28:40.940]   Is that the same genus Davis as Earth Girls are easy?
[01:28:40.940 --> 01:28:42.740]   That, Gina Davis?
[01:28:42.740 --> 01:28:43.580]   The actress.
[01:28:43.580 --> 01:28:44.620]   The Tolls.
[01:28:44.620 --> 01:28:45.500]   Willoughby actress.
[01:28:45.500 --> 01:28:46.940]   Thelma and Louise.
[01:28:46.940 --> 01:28:47.580]   Thelma and Louise.
[01:28:47.580 --> 01:28:49.540]   Yeah, I don't know if she did her for the lazy, but--
[01:28:49.540 --> 01:28:51.180]   Yeah, no, she did.
[01:28:51.180 --> 01:28:54.100]   She was in a bikini throughout most of the film.
[01:28:54.100 --> 01:28:56.820]   I don't know why I imprinted on my memory.
[01:28:56.820 --> 01:28:59.340]   No.
[01:28:59.340 --> 01:29:00.540]   She was six feet tall.
[01:29:00.540 --> 01:29:03.260]   I ran into her once at a B or something.
[01:29:03.260 --> 01:29:04.980]   Yeah, she was very tall.
[01:29:04.980 --> 01:29:06.860]   Bold me right over.
[01:29:06.860 --> 01:29:08.860]   So this is exactly what-- it's funny
[01:29:08.860 --> 01:29:10.500]   that you should mention this because I just signed up
[01:29:10.500 --> 01:29:12.420]   for this thing called SANE BOX.
[01:29:12.420 --> 01:29:13.380]   Have you seen this?
[01:29:13.380 --> 01:29:13.900]   Oh, wait.
[01:29:13.900 --> 01:29:15.700]   That was one of the ones I wanted to sign up for.
[01:29:15.700 --> 01:29:16.860]   And then I pulled back.
[01:29:16.860 --> 01:29:17.740]   It looks neat.
[01:29:17.740 --> 01:29:19.700]   Well, I did it so you don't have to.
[01:29:19.700 --> 01:29:20.900]   Thank you.
[01:29:20.900 --> 01:29:23.300]   Now it works with all IMAP mail.
[01:29:23.300 --> 01:29:25.860]   So I did it with Gmail, but you could do it
[01:29:25.860 --> 01:29:28.180]   with any IMAP mail system.
[01:29:28.180 --> 01:29:29.820]   And what it does is it goes through all your mail.
[01:29:29.820 --> 01:29:32.700]   They say we don't read your mail.
[01:29:32.700 --> 01:29:34.340]   They still have access to it.
[01:29:34.340 --> 01:29:36.020]   Yeah, so I mean, I don't know exactly.
[01:29:36.020 --> 01:29:38.340]   Yeah, you're giving it access with OAuth.
[01:29:38.340 --> 01:29:39.580]   So are they just doing a-- they're
[01:29:39.580 --> 01:29:42.260]   saying they're doing a better job than Priority Inbox?
[01:29:42.260 --> 01:29:42.940]   Yeah, I guess.
[01:29:42.940 --> 01:29:44.220]   So let me go to my Gmail.
[01:29:44.220 --> 01:29:47.060]   And I'll show you what it did here.
[01:29:47.060 --> 01:29:51.140]   This is always a thrill when I go to my Gmail.
[01:29:51.140 --> 01:29:56.220]   It created two new folders, SANE Archive.
[01:29:56.220 --> 01:30:02.740]   And SANE later-- and I'm not sure why--
[01:30:02.740 --> 01:30:05.260]   but stuff that's old, stuff--
[01:30:05.260 --> 01:30:07.740]   oh, the later is good.
[01:30:07.740 --> 01:30:08.900]   And it seems to have worked.
[01:30:08.900 --> 01:30:13.380]   All the newsletter-y things that I don't really
[01:30:13.380 --> 01:30:17.260]   want to have in my main mail, it moves them over.
[01:30:17.260 --> 01:30:19.460]   So it's kind of like a rule.
[01:30:19.460 --> 01:30:22.060]   SANE Archive is older stuff, as you can see.
[01:30:22.060 --> 01:30:24.860]   So the idea is it cleans up your inbox and the stuff that's
[01:30:24.860 --> 01:30:25.380]   in here.
[01:30:25.380 --> 01:30:26.260]   Like that, all set.
[01:30:26.260 --> 01:30:27.820]   Yeah.
[01:30:27.820 --> 01:30:31.780]   But you have to give it access to your--
[01:30:31.780 --> 01:30:34.460]   Do you know what you're doing?
[01:30:34.460 --> 01:30:35.140]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:30:35.140 --> 01:30:35.780]   Yeah, same.
[01:30:35.780 --> 01:30:38.700]   You say, I go to you-- what would Steve do it?
[01:30:38.700 --> 01:30:40.380]   No, of course Steve wouldn't do it.
[01:30:40.380 --> 01:30:43.140]   But Steve's still using Windows XP.
[01:30:43.140 --> 01:30:44.860]   Steve's probably using PINE.
[01:30:44.860 --> 01:30:46.380]   I don't think Steve's a good example.
[01:30:46.380 --> 01:30:47.380]   Steve's using my console now.
[01:30:47.380 --> 01:30:49.700]   Steve Gibson, we're talking about our security guy.
[01:30:49.700 --> 01:30:52.060]   Our algorithms determine the importance of each email
[01:30:52.060 --> 01:30:54.060]   move unimportant messages out of the inbox
[01:30:54.060 --> 01:30:57.620]   into a separate folder and summarize them for you.
[01:30:57.620 --> 01:30:59.420]   So you get an email summary.
[01:30:59.420 --> 01:31:01.900]   The summary is, boy, you got a lot of crap today.
[01:31:01.900 --> 01:31:04.060]   Yeah, well, I have-- my email is out of control.
[01:31:04.060 --> 01:31:08.740]   So anything-- it moves attachments to the cloud.
[01:31:08.740 --> 01:31:10.460]   You connect it to your social networks
[01:31:10.460 --> 01:31:13.460]   that gets smarter about who you want to hear from or not.
[01:31:13.460 --> 01:31:15.100]   There's a black hole unsubscribe.
[01:31:15.100 --> 01:31:15.740]   Love that.
[01:31:15.740 --> 01:31:17.740]   Once you drag something into your black hole folder,
[01:31:17.740 --> 01:31:19.660]   you'll never hear from that sender again.
[01:31:19.660 --> 01:31:21.060]   It goes straight to the trash.
[01:31:21.060 --> 01:31:22.140]   This is simple.
[01:31:22.140 --> 01:31:24.540]   I have a direct message for Google.
[01:31:24.540 --> 01:31:25.460]   Buy this.
[01:31:25.460 --> 01:31:27.860]   Well, probably what their plan is, right?
[01:31:27.860 --> 01:31:28.820]   Follow-up reminders.
[01:31:28.820 --> 01:31:30.500]   Notify you when an email you sent was not
[01:31:30.500 --> 01:31:34.580]   replied to by a certain time so you can follow up on it.
[01:31:34.580 --> 01:31:36.020]   Defer an email until you're ready.
[01:31:36.020 --> 01:31:37.820]   So there are other saying boxes.
[01:31:37.820 --> 01:31:40.820]   There's saying tomorrow, saying next week.
[01:31:40.820 --> 01:31:43.100]   So you can just drag a thing over there and let you know.
[01:31:43.100 --> 01:31:47.340]   It's $5 a month, but you've got it free for some period of time.
[01:31:47.340 --> 01:31:48.700]   I'm using the free version.
[01:31:48.700 --> 01:31:52.780]   Monitor your spam folder for good mail and moves it back in.
[01:31:52.780 --> 01:31:57.260]   It's an intriguing idea, but you're right.
[01:31:57.260 --> 01:31:58.900]   I mean, you have to have some trust.
[01:31:58.900 --> 01:31:59.700]   I almost did it.
[01:31:59.700 --> 01:32:00.260]   Then I went--
[01:32:00.260 --> 01:32:02.020]   I did it because I just--
[01:32:02.020 --> 01:32:04.260]   I don't have any--
[01:32:04.260 --> 01:32:04.900]   Tempting.
[01:32:04.900 --> 01:32:05.540]   Very tempting.
[01:32:05.540 --> 01:32:06.860]   Tempting.
[01:32:06.860 --> 01:32:08.820]   Well, I'll let you know.
[01:32:08.820 --> 01:32:09.540]   It takes a while.
[01:32:09.540 --> 01:32:12.340]   I didn't have any results for a day or two.
[01:32:12.340 --> 01:32:14.020]   And then all of a sudden, as you see,
[01:32:14.020 --> 01:32:16.900]   it was starting to do some stuff.
[01:32:16.900 --> 01:32:18.620]   So there you go.
[01:32:18.620 --> 01:32:19.260]   It's a good tool.
[01:32:19.260 --> 01:32:19.780]   It's a good tip.
[01:32:19.780 --> 01:32:19.780]   A good tip.
[01:32:19.780 --> 01:32:20.300]   What is it?
[01:32:20.300 --> 01:32:20.820]   Yeah.
[01:32:20.820 --> 01:32:21.060]   Cool.
[01:32:21.060 --> 01:32:23.380]   Ask me in a couple of weeks how I like it.
[01:32:23.380 --> 01:32:24.140]   We will.
[01:32:24.140 --> 01:32:24.980]   All right.
[01:32:24.980 --> 01:32:27.020]   Jeff Jarvis, City University of New York.
[01:32:27.020 --> 01:32:28.060]   Thank you for being here.
[01:32:28.060 --> 01:32:29.460]   We appreciate it.
[01:32:29.460 --> 01:32:32.060]   I know you had a speech and you're in Florida,
[01:32:32.060 --> 01:32:33.100]   but it worked great.
[01:32:33.100 --> 01:32:33.860]   And we're really pleased.
[01:32:33.860 --> 01:32:37.260]   I'm fuzzy and pink, but happy to be here.
[01:32:37.260 --> 01:32:38.100]   Yes.
[01:32:38.100 --> 01:32:41.940]   And you look great as fuzzy and pink as you are.
[01:32:41.940 --> 01:32:46.780]   Gina Trepani is the creator of a great to do app
[01:32:46.780 --> 01:32:47.780]   called to do.text.
[01:32:47.780 --> 01:32:48.940]   You must find out more about it.
[01:32:48.940 --> 01:32:50.060]   It's available on Android.
[01:32:50.060 --> 01:32:51.780]   And it's an iPhone too.
[01:32:51.780 --> 01:32:52.060]   Yep.
[01:32:52.060 --> 01:32:52.660]   iPhone too.
[01:32:52.660 --> 01:32:54.220]   Yeah.
[01:32:54.220 --> 01:32:55.980]   You're just going to love it.
[01:32:55.980 --> 01:32:59.820]   And of course, you think up and read her in the magazine.
[01:32:59.820 --> 01:33:02.100]   Marco Armett's The Magazine.
[01:33:02.100 --> 01:33:03.660]   Edition two.
[01:33:03.660 --> 01:33:04.060]   Yep.
[01:33:04.060 --> 01:33:04.740]   Issue two.
[01:33:04.740 --> 01:33:05.260]   We do this.
[01:33:05.260 --> 01:33:05.740]   We show today.
[01:33:05.740 --> 01:33:06.660]   A lot of fun.
[01:33:06.660 --> 01:33:07.100]   Always fun.
[01:33:07.100 --> 01:33:07.460]   It was fun.
[01:33:07.460 --> 01:33:08.340]   Just chilling today.
[01:33:08.340 --> 01:33:09.220]   It was very cheap.
[01:33:09.220 --> 01:33:11.020]   It wasn't, you know, heavy news show.
[01:33:11.020 --> 01:33:11.300]   We're just checking.
[01:33:11.300 --> 01:33:12.220]   I like that.
[01:33:12.220 --> 01:33:12.940]   Just getting together.
[01:33:12.940 --> 01:33:13.660]   A couple of friends.
[01:33:13.660 --> 01:33:14.620]   Getting together.
[01:33:14.620 --> 01:33:17.900]   Hanging out over the cracker barrel.
[01:33:17.900 --> 01:33:19.380]   Having a pickle?
[01:33:19.380 --> 01:33:21.220]   Don't play checkers.
[01:33:21.220 --> 01:33:23.140]   We do this at 1 p.m.
[01:33:23.140 --> 01:33:23.900]   Pacific 4 p.m.
[01:33:23.900 --> 01:33:25.300]   Eastern time.
[01:33:25.300 --> 01:33:27.940]   2,100 UTC on Twitter.tv.
[01:33:27.940 --> 01:33:29.140]   Watch live.
[01:33:29.140 --> 01:33:30.340]   But if you can't--
