[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160]   It's time for Twig this week in Google's Stacey Higginbotham and Jeff Jarvis are here
[00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.000]   so much to talk about.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.440]   Elon Musk's plan to put internet everywhere by launching 4,000 satellites.
[00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.840]   He's actually filed for permits to do it.
[00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.760]   We'll talk about that.
[00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.560]   What's up with Google, Facebook, Medium, all of that and more.
[00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.920]   This week at Google is next.
[00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.920]   The cast you love.
[00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.920]   From people you trust.
[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.520]   This is Twig.
[00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:45.920]   Bandwidth for this week in Google is provided by CashFly, C-A-C-H-E-F-L-Y dot com.
[00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.600]   Hi this is Leo LePort and once again time for Twig's audience survey we'd really like
[00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.920]   to hear from you.
[00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.000]   It's only going to take a couple of minutes really, that's all.

[00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.600]   support.
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.000]   This is Twig this week in Google.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   Episode 392 recorded Wednesday, February 15, 2017.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.800]   Buried in the common area.

[00:01:53.960 --> 00:02:01.680]   It's time for Twig this week in general stuff.
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.120]   I was waiting for that.
[00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.000]   Used to be Google.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.760]   But now it's anything we want to talk about.
[00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.560]   Stacey Higginbotham is here from Stacey on IoT.
[00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:15.920]   I have a lot of questions for you.
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.760]   IoT has been big in the news this week.
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:19.760]   And you're always...
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:20.760]   And they have answers.
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.840]   Yeah, you're always keeping up on what's going on with these little devices we're hooking
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:24.840]   up in our house.
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.360]   Well, I'll ask you a question in a second.
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.200]   But let me introduce Jeff Jarvis, who's also here from the City University of New York,
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.760]   taking a snow day.
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:33.760]   Yes.
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.440]   So we got a very thoughtful letter about the show that someone who complained that we've
[00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.200]   gotten too far away from Google.
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.200]   I meant to respond to him.
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.040]   I forgot whoever it is if you're watching.
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.880]   I think it was very thoughtful and smart.
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.040]   We were never all about Google.
[00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.440]   No, there's probably some measure of Google we could come back to, but that's fine.
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.440]   We were in even in the earliest days, it was about Google and the cloud.
[00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:57.440]   And notice our...
[00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:58.440]   Yes, it was.
[00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.640]   Our logo is a puffy little cloud.
[00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.560]   And I think we have to include...
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:02.560]   I think it's platforms.
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.480]   Which meant Google, Facebook and Twitter.
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.080]   Yes, yes.
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.080]   So...
[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.600]   But I didn't want to do a social media show.
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:09.920]   We actually had a social media show.
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:10.920]   You tried that, oddly.
[00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:11.920]   There wasn't...
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:12.920]   What was to say about Facebook?
[00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:13.920]   I knew of itself.
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:14.920]   Yeah.
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:20.880]   I think that I prefer what we do, which is the impact of Google, Facebook and Twitter
[00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.000]   on real life.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   And I think we pretty much stick to that.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.920]   There's been a little politics leaking in.
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:28.920]   But you know what?
[00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.320]   I defy you to walk down the street, any street in America, not have a little politics sleep
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:34.320]   sneak in.
[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.840]   You know, the New York Times just...
[00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.760]   I was on the homepage and they said 13 stories that have nothing to do with politics.
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.360]   And I was like, "Oh, click!"
[00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.120]   Yeah, a lot of people...
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.120]   I think that's not unusual.
[00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.320]   A lot of people, including my wife, are saying, "Can we do..."
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.680]   You know, let's just take a break from all the politics.
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.600]   But if you look at...
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.360]   You could do that, but if you look at the top stories in the New York Times, they're
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.480]   all about politics.
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.160]   Because people do want to read this stuff.
[00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.360]   And we're not gonna...
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:08.440]   This is not a show about politics, but it's inevitably gonna leak in a little bit.
[00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:15.040]   A, because there is an excess of politics and tech, but B, because we're human.
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:20.000]   We're gonna talk about the things that are on our top of our mind.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.120]   But let me ask you, Stacey, about...
[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:25.120]   I finally...
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.120]   Yes, it was on Valentine's Day.
[00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:35.720]   And I left the room briefly and I came back to my wife, yelling, saying, "Can we get a
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:41.840]   G.D. television system that I can use?"
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.840]   I can't... I just want to watch Netflix.
[00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:46.840]   How'd...
[00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:47.840]   Wow.
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:48.840]   So...
[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:56.240]   You know, this is a challenge because I have a fairly complex home theater system.
[00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:57.760]   Several of them.
[00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.680]   My man caves worse.
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:04.840]   The one in the living room is a little more straightforward, but it has an AV receiver.
[00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:05.840]   It has Netflix.
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.760]   It has an Apple TV.
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.680]   It has a Blu-ray player/play station.
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.040]   It has an television set.
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:19.480]   It's kind of complicated and you have to know, well, Netflix is on the Roku, so you go to
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.040]   the Roku for that.
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:23.000]   Or you go to the Apple TV for that.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.440]   You could watch Netflix on the Panasonic television, but it's not as good.
[00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:28.840]   You know, that kind of thing.
[00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:29.840]   So I finally...
[00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:30.840]   Tell me if I made a mistake.
[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:31.840]   I said, "All right, give up.
[00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:32.840]   I'm buying a Harmony Hub."
[00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:36.280]   Oh, I just bought one last week yesterday.
[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:37.280]   It's coming tomorrow.
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:40.040]   We're just like in sync, aren't we?
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:41.040]   It's a little spooky.
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.520]   I'm going to start menstruating at the same time.
[00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:44.600]   No, I'm kidding.
[00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:45.600]   Joking.
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:46.600]   Cut that out.
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:47.600]   Cut that out.
[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:48.600]   Yeah.
[00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:49.600]   Yeah.
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:50.600]   Just know.
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:51.600]   No.
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:52.600]   Wrong kind of thing.
[00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:53.600]   Wrong kind of thing.
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.640]   There's still that's there.
[00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.600]   Both of us go like this.
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.360]   And me going, "Ah!"
[00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:01.360]   Okay.
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:02.600]   No, but do you think...
[00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:04.520]   Now I've had before Harmony 1s.
[00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:08.240]   I've had a variety of Harmony remotes.
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.280]   And it never really worked well for me.
[00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:14.040]   So tell me about the hub because you can do it with the echo, right?
[00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.040]   Yes.
[00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.040]   Okay.
[00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.560]   So I tried the hub like when it first came out.
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:22.760]   And that was like two years ago and I brought it in and it was awesome for AV because you
[00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:28.800]   can do the complicated stuff like set time delays, which may or may not matter for you.
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.880]   But like my receiver takes a second to be like, "Oh, we're not a second."
[00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:32.880]   No, it does.
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.800]   All of them do because they have to handshake and no one.
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.240]   I got out with the boot and handshake and the whole.
[00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.680]   I don't even know what's happening.
[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:41.360]   So it was great for that.
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:46.160]   So the reason I bought it is because now I'm because I'm so incredibly lazy.
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:51.800]   I want to say echo, turn on my Netflix.
[00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:52.800]   Yes.
[00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.360]   Well, that's what I want Lisa to be able to do.
[00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:57.760]   She should be able to say echo, "Watch Netflix in the living room."
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:59.720]   So that is what I think is going to happen.
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:00.920]   So I've got to set that up.
[00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.840]   Talk to me next week because it comes tomorrow.
[00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:03.840]   Mine comes Friday.
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:04.840]   Because that's what I'm saying.
[00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:05.840]   There you go.
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:07.640]   Well, go clear notes.
[00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:09.200]   Well, we could be like, "Did it work?"
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:10.960]   Because I didn't buy the remote.
[00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:11.960]   I just want to.
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:13.960]   This is Kavo's 400.
[00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:14.960]   That's beautiful.
[00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:15.960]   But it's awesome.
[00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:16.960]   Yeah.
[00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:18.400]   The nice thing about the Harmony Hub is it's not expensive.
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:19.600]   It's like a hundred bucks, right?
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:20.600]   Yeah, it's a hundred bucks.
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:22.440]   If you get the remote, it's more expensive.
[00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:26.200]   But the idea is I don't want the remote because you use your smartphone, right?
[00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:27.200]   Right.
[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:28.800]   Well, I'm going to use the echo.
[00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:29.800]   Or the echo.
[00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:31.160]   We'll see what happens.
[00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:36.400]   Again, this is why I bought it because I'm like, "By golly, it's too good not to buy it."
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:37.400]   Your mom has one.
[00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:38.400]   She says, "That's how I do it.
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:43.120]   You should also have a tablet around for things like volume control because you can't do that
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:45.120]   by voice commands."
[00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:46.120]   That's what...
[00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:47.120]   Dr. Mom's...
[00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:49.520]   One of the reasons I got it is because of you, Dr. Mom, you're always saying, "Oh, I could
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:52.520]   talk to my TV and that would be nice."
[00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:56.040]   Oh, I thought you could do the echo thing with volume.
[00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:57.040]   Maybe you can.
[00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:58.040]   I don't know.
[00:07:58.040 --> 00:07:59.040]   No, well, yeah.
[00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:00.240]   She says, "Keep a tablet around so you can..."
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:03.480]   Well, I'll just leave a tablet on the living room there.
[00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:04.480]   That's actually...
[00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:05.480]   I haven't...
[00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:06.480]   I don't know, but that would be...
[00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:10.760]   I almost always have a laptop in front of the TV anyway.
[00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:14.320]   Especially if I'm watching like the Grammys or the Oscars or something with it.
[00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:16.640]   Yeah, but if you leave it in another room and then you can't do anything unless you go
[00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:17.640]   get it, that's going to be...
[00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:18.640]   No, that's why I'm going to dedicate...
[00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:24.800]   I'm going to dedicate this Chromebook because it's a tablet as well, an Android tablet.
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:27.760]   And this will be a wonderful living room.
[00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:31.000]   Oh, my wife would hate that being that all the time.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   Yeah, that's...
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.720]   Your wife has no choice.
[00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:35.720]   And your husband, no choice.
[00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:38.960]   Well, you know what I would probably like to do?
[00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:39.960]   I want something...
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:41.720]   Here's the dream scenario.
[00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:46.400]   It's too expensive right now, but I want an old phone that has inductive charging on it
[00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:51.160]   so I can just put in a nice little container on a side table.
[00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:53.720]   Because otherwise the phone is going to constantly need charging and that's...
[00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:54.720]   That's a good idea.
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:55.800]   That's a really good point.
[00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:56.800]   I have that.
[00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:58.360]   I always have left over stuff.
[00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:00.200]   I can do that too.
[00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:01.280]   Does it have inductive charging?
[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:04.640]   Because the key is not having to plug in your freaking remote.
[00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:07.720]   No, and let me show you the inductive charger you should get.
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:08.720]   The tilt.
[00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:09.720]   Tell me, tell me.
[00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:10.720]   Yeah.
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:11.720]   Okay.
[00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:13.440]   And I have a couple and I really love them.
[00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:17.800]   It's the Qi wireless charging.
[00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:22.680]   This is TYLT.com is the company and they make a cradle.
[00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:23.680]   Where is it?
[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:24.680]   Oh, that's pretty.
[00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:25.680]   It's right there.
[00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:26.680]   You see it?
[00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:27.680]   Is that it?
[00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:28.680]   The thing right here?
[00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:29.680]   Let me close it.
[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:30.680]   Yeah, this is it right here.
[00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:31.680]   Oh.
[00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:35.240]   The VU, VU, Oomle out, $30.
[00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:37.040]   And so you just put your phone on that.
[00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:39.840]   The nice thing about it is it's kind of naturally positioned.
[00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:42.440]   Comes in a variety of colors to fit your decor.
[00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:45.240]   As long as your decor is orange.
[00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:51.120]   Like a green or bright blue.
[00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:53.880]   But no, I really like this.
[00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:56.560]   It works really well.
[00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:57.560]   And you just...
[00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:58.560]   You don't have to sit there.
[00:09:58.560 --> 00:09:59.560]   You have to have a wireless phone obviously.
[00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:00.560]   That's why I was charging phone.
[00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:01.560]   I was...
[00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:02.560]   Right.
[00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:07.360]   So I'm now going to be paying, let's say, $100 for the Logitech Harmony, $30 for the charger.
[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:13.440]   I've got an old phone that may or I may have to buy a little charging case.
[00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:14.440]   We'll call that $30.
[00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:17.640]   So now I'm $160 so I can talk to my TV.
[00:10:17.640 --> 00:10:18.640]   It's worth it.
[00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:20.200]   Oh, I have such a loser.
[00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:21.720]   No, this is your...
[00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:22.960]   Hey, a little hint for you.
[00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:24.560]   It's all tax deductible.
[00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:28.560]   So the good news is the tax payers help foot the bill.
[00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:31.800]   I feel much better now.
[00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:32.800]   It's your business.
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:33.800]   Stacey on IOT.
[00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:34.800]   I know.
[00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:40.240]   I mean, I will put it on my business account, but I'm like, "Oh, this may be silly.
[00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:42.320]   I'm fully acknowledging that it may be silly."
[00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:47.920]   Well, what's really odd is we both did it within 24 hours of one another.
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:50.520]   But it was Valentine's Day that did it for me and just the pain.
[00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:52.360]   And I felt really bad.
[00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:53.360]   You should.
[00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:54.360]   I've really bad.
[00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:55.360]   I wrote up a manual.
[00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:57.160]   It's like eight pages.
[00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:02.360]   And that's the simple one.
[00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:03.840]   Go in my office.
[00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:06.880]   You know, I'm the only one who knows how to do that.
[00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:08.040]   Does it make you feel powerful?
[00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:09.640]   No, it's make you frustrated.
[00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:11.400]   I don't like...
[00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:17.440]   And the worst thing is nowadays, TV's because of this thing called CEC, every device as
[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:20.480]   it wakes up and says, "Hello, takes over the TV."
[00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:21.480]   So I have to sit and wait.
[00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:23.720]   When the TV goes, "What?
[00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:24.720]   Oh, you want to talk...
[00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:25.720]   Wait a minute.
[00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:26.720]   No, you want to talk?
[00:11:26.720 --> 00:11:28.440]   And I can overrule it.
[00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:29.440]   It doesn't matter.
[00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:31.840]   I just have to wait till it goes through the devices."
[00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:35.560]   So 30 seconds later, I could say, "Okay, go back to the TV now."
[00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:36.960]   It's terrible.
[00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:41.040]   It just has to be a universal problem or nearly universal.
[00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:42.040]   Yes.
[00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:44.440]   Like complicated TV setups?
[00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:45.440]   Yeah.
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:46.440]   Yes.
[00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:48.880]   I mean, I remember like 15 years ago when I was going over to people's houses to babysit
[00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:52.920]   their kids and they would be like, "And here, this is how you work the television."
[00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:54.520]   And they would hand me the instruction manual.
[00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:58.320]   And that was just because they had multiple receivers and game consoles.
[00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:04.000]   They were fancy people and they were ahead of the times.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:11.600]   So moving on to stuff other people care about.
[00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:16.000]   Well, let me mention another thing I bought that I'm going to say don't buy whatever you
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   do.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.840]   The Android 2.0 Watch, the LG Sport.
[00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:24.040]   Is this the fancy one or the less fancy?
[00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:25.040]   LTE or no?
[00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:26.720]   Yeah, I got the one with LTE.
[00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:32.000]   But Florence Ion got the style and that's the simpler one and much more attractive.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:35.240]   And frankly, the only one that's at all comfortable.
[00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:36.240]   The sport.
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:38.240]   So it's wearing a pancake?
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:43.160]   Oh, first of all, it was worse than that, Jeff, because it's thick because it has GPS
[00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:44.960]   and LTE in it.
[00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:47.160]   And it's going to give you risk cancer for all that.
[00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:48.160]   Who knows?
[00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:50.640]   My sport has its own phone number.
[00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:55.680]   So I can only receive calls like a place calls.
[00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:59.600]   And because it, but here's one good thing that Apple, one thing that the Apple Watch
[00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:00.960]   can't do that they can do.
[00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:02.720]   It can also stream Google music.
[00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:04.160]   So you don't have to have music on the watch.
[00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:07.800]   You can listen to your Google stations via LTE.
[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:10.360]   You'll pay for all of this, of course.
[00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:15.080]   If you have AT&T, you can connect, you can share it with your phones.
[00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:17.600]   So you don't have to pay for another account phone number.
[00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:20.080]   But you can pay 10 bucks a month for it?
[00:13:20.080 --> 00:13:22.640]   I think not because you're using the same phone number as your phone.
[00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:24.880]   So there's a sync thing.
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:29.600]   But I pay 10 bucks a month because I have a dedicated phone number for it.
[00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:30.600]   Ridiculous.
[00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:32.120]   You just don't see that.
[00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:38.520]   GPS, heart rate monitor that's not as great as the Apple Watch or if it's kind of okay.
[00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:42.160]   But the worst thing is the antennas, it's ugly as sin.
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:44.080]   It's slate gray.
[00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:48.600]   And the band is, it cannot be removed because the antennas are in the band going about halfway
[00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:50.160]   down your wrist.
[00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:51.560]   That part is inflexible.
[00:13:51.560 --> 00:13:55.640]   You kind of see it when you look at that picture right there, that bump, it's kind of an odd
[00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:56.800]   curve.
[00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:57.800]   That's fixed.
[00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:03.360]   It's a hard, solid antenna up and down, bottom and top and bottom.
[00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:04.960]   And so it's just not comfortable.
[00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:06.600]   It doesn't conform to the wrist very well.
[00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:07.600]   No wonder what the sport.
[00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:09.360]   I've got the sport about this style.
[00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:11.480]   It's fine, but it loses the LTE.
[00:14:11.480 --> 00:14:12.480]   It loses the GPS.
[00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:13.480]   Which is fine.
[00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:14.680]   I don't want any of that.
[00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:17.320]   Well, you know what I did today?
[00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:18.320]   What?
[00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:19.960]   What do you want?
[00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:22.800]   I got a new battery in my plain old one.
[00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:23.800]   Good for you.
[00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:25.840]   You know what?
[00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:28.000]   Frankly, that's fine.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.800]   You know, it's fine.
[00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:33.520]   I'm not a big fan of smart watches.
[00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:35.840]   I like regular wrist watches a lot.
[00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:38.120]   The problem is, it's a social problem.
[00:14:38.120 --> 00:14:42.160]   I did like not having to pull up the phone and see it alert or whatever.
[00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:43.840]   But I looked like I was rude every time.
[00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:45.160]   Oh, you're tired of talking to me.
[00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:46.160]   You're looking at your watch.
[00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:48.280]   No, I'm checking a message.
[00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:49.280]   Not a game.
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:52.880]   That is also rude.
[00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:55.080]   If you're in the middle of a conversation with someone.
[00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:56.640]   Well, that's the hell with that.
[00:14:56.640 --> 00:15:02.000]   But not only that, but I find I end up pulling out the phone anyway.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.720]   Now, look at the watch.
[00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:04.720]   I see others a message.
[00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:06.280]   Oh, let me get the phone.
[00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:08.840]   It's like, it's double the worse.
[00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:10.280]   It's worse.
[00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:13.920]   I only like it because my phone's never, my phone's usually in my purse or my bag.
[00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:17.840]   So I like having, I don't actually want to see the message necessarily, but I like knowing
[00:15:17.840 --> 00:15:20.140]   that a certain type of message came in.
[00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:25.320]   So that's practical, but that's the only, and I have a ring for that.
[00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:26.320]   So.
[00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:27.320]   Puffa.
[00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:28.320]   Puffa.
[00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:29.320]   Puffa.
[00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:30.320]   Puffa.
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:32.400]   I do miss having a watch.
[00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:33.400]   Do you?
[00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:37.160]   I just stopped wearing various fitness trackers.
[00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:42.760]   I may get a charge, but I, they weren't doing anything for me.
[00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:49.000]   I do like fitness trackers, mostly because it gives me some peer pressure.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.320]   And that's where the Apple Watch, Apple Watch excels because you share, you get your rings,
[00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:56.200]   you see, you know, you kind of graphically, quickly how you're doing.
[00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:59.080]   And then you see how your friends are doing.
[00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:05.280]   And like Renee Richie now sends donuts when you complete a workout because he's Canadian.
[00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:07.200]   And like Tim Horton donuts?
[00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:08.200]   They look like Tim Horton's.
[00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:11.840]   You can't eat them unless you, you have to eat your wash.
[00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:13.440]   They're on your watch.
[00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:15.720]   That's the most depressing kind of donut ever.
[00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:20.360]   It makes you want to do that, but you can't have it.
[00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:24.000]   No, I find that makes me want to work out.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   Okay.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:26.800]   You're not that way.
[00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:29.120]   No, I'm, I'm so contrary.
[00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:31.800]   Any, any gamification efforts just piss me off.
[00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:37.800]   I'm like, that's why you don't have a boss.
[00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:38.800]   Probably.
[00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:39.800]   Yeah.
[00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:40.800]   I, well, yeah.
[00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:43.880]   I don't want anyone to tell me what to do.
[00:16:43.880 --> 00:16:47.280]   Because some people, and I think you're like this, somebody tells you to do something.
[00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:48.280]   You do the other thing.
[00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:49.880]   You're the opposite, right?
[00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:54.600]   That is how I got a tongue ring.
[00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:56.160]   That took my breath away.
[00:16:56.160 --> 00:16:59.000]   Your mother, your mother said Stacy do not.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:03.200]   No, no, my, my boyfriend's soon to be husband at the time was like, you're not going to
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:04.200]   do that.
[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:06.920]   I was like, oh, don't you tell me what to do.
[00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:08.400]   I'm not your host.
[00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:11.920]   Wait, wait, wait, wait, your boyfriend's soon to be husband at the time.
[00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:13.560]   Yes, I don't have one now.
[00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:14.560]   I took it out.
[00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:15.560]   This was when I was younger.
[00:17:15.560 --> 00:17:17.080]   You took your husband out?
[00:17:17.080 --> 00:17:18.080]   No.
[00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:19.080]   Is he buried in that backyard?
[00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:21.280]   He's buried in the common area.
[00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:25.280]   No, she kept Andrew, but she got rid of the tongue ring.
[00:17:25.280 --> 00:17:28.400]   That's one advantage of piercings, though, is you could take him out and they could things
[00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:30.080]   kind of mostly grow back.
[00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:31.680]   They do?
[00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:33.920]   Now we really have gone a far from Google.
[00:17:33.920 --> 00:17:35.920]   Back to the heat.
[00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:38.720]   Do you have a numb spot in the tongue?
[00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:39.960]   No, they do.
[00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:44.480]   But when you've got it, you talked like this, didn't you?
[00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:45.880]   Come on, tell the truth.
[00:17:45.880 --> 00:17:47.720]   There was like three days of, yeah.
[00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:50.360]   Oh, it's a terrible thing to do.
[00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:52.960]   It's very risky too.
[00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:56.000]   But did you get a stutter or ring?
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   A stud.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   It's in the middle of your tongue.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   Yeah, it's a stud.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   Really.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   It's a stud.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   Okay.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.600]   But let's have, hey, you know what?
[00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:05.280]   Google laid off a bunch of people.
[00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:06.280]   You should listen to Andrew.
[00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:08.280]   That's all I'm saying.
[00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:09.280]   No.
[00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:15.280]   And he still married you after that, huh?
[00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:17.360]   What can I say?
[00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:19.000]   He's a smart man.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   He's a smart man.
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   All right.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   Google laid off people.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   What?
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   No, that's not true.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   Is it?
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:30.280]   They reallocated people because they have a new CEO and their fiber division.
[00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:31.800]   Oh, the fiber.
[00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:33.480]   Is this part of the rundown?
[00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:35.360]   I should have looked at the rundown more closely.
[00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:36.640]   No, bring it up.
[00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:37.640]   Go ahead.
[00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:40.080]   It's depressing because I'm surprised they're even doing it.
[00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:42.720]   But well, they're there here.
[00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:44.880]   I've got too many too many tabs.
[00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:46.360]   Let's do it.
[00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:47.440]   So they're doing more fiber.
[00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:51.040]   We talked about this on Sunday because one of our panelists, Jason Heiner, lives in
[00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:56.640]   Louisville, which was upgraded from a potential to an upcoming.
[00:18:56.640 --> 00:19:01.400]   And we had thought the fiber had was like frozen.
[00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:03.800]   But it's not well, they're doubling down on wires.
[00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:07.160]   So let me as I scroll to find the story.
[00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:08.240]   Have you found the story yet?
[00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:10.320]   Because I'm sucking.
[00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:15.320]   Ugh, Google fiber.
[00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:18.320]   I started looking up Logitech Harmony stuff instead.
[00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:23.280]   Okay, names do boss shed staff USA today.
[00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:26.480]   So it was red bar are barded.
[00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:28.360]   Barnett was born at left.
[00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:29.800]   Barrett rather left.
[00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:30.800]   Yeah.
[00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:31.800]   Next.
[00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:32.800]   Now they have a guy named Greg.
[00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:34.360]   That was October.
[00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:38.080]   It was and they had nobody could have in charge at the time.
[00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:43.000]   But now they've got Gregory McCray, who I don't know who he is.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.680]   I'm looking.
[00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:48.520]   But they have let's see.
[00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:49.520]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:53.400]   They're going up against AT&T in the cities where AT&T says they're going to roll out
[00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:54.400]   fiber.
[00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:57.200]   Google has started to roll it out.
[00:19:57.200 --> 00:20:04.000]   But I think a lot of this Jason called it fiber to the press release.
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.800]   Instead of fiber to the curb, right?
[00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:09.720]   If I were to the premise, but yeah, well, no, not premise.
[00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:11.400]   No press release.
[00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:12.400]   Well, yes.
[00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:16.800]   It's all about appearances and less about anything else.
[00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:19.400]   Well, that's what I called AT&T's efforts originally.
[00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:20.400]   Yeah.
[00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:24.720]   But well, not their first ones, which were in Austin because those are actually happening,
[00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:28.080]   but a lot of their other cities that they announced not getting anything right now.
[00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:32.000]   McCray came from Arrow communications.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   Greg.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   Yeah.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:39.760]   Greg, Greg McCray came from Arrow communications.
[00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:43.080]   Is that not the arrow that was doing the local antenna arrow?
[00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:44.080]   Is it?
[00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:45.080]   Maybe it is.
[00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:46.080]   Area.
[00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:47.080]   Well, yeah, that was area.
[00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:48.080]   Not arrow.
[00:20:48.080 --> 00:20:49.080]   That was area.
[00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:50.080]   Okay.
[00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:56.200]   Google is also losing hundreds of employees while moving them to positions, other positions.
[00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:57.840]   There won't be any layoffs.
[00:20:57.840 --> 00:21:01.400]   So they'll be reabsorbed into the Google.
[00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:05.440]   Now, this says area of communications, which was the.
[00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:07.200]   Oh, it was area.
[00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:08.200]   Okay.
[00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:11.240]   So maybe business insider spelled it wrong.
[00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:17.440]   Steve, that's a real good question because USA Today has it.
[00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:20.880]   Radio communications, but there is also an arrow.
[00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:22.720]   Like the career.
[00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:30.120]   Well, there's Greg McCray, who is the with the Boston Celtics.
[00:21:30.120 --> 00:21:31.120]   That's not him.
[00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:34.120]   Let me go to.
[00:21:34.120 --> 00:21:37.600]   Let me go to Bloomberg story because Mark Bergen's usually really good.
[00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:39.600]   Gregory McKay, McCray.
[00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:40.600]   He is.
[00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:41.880]   He spelled it correctly.
[00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:42.880]   Arrow communication.
[00:21:42.880 --> 00:21:43.880]   So it's not area.
[00:21:43.880 --> 00:21:44.880]   It's not area.
[00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:45.880]   It's not area.
[00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:46.880]   No, according to.
[00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:48.840]   Sorry, USA Today.
[00:21:48.840 --> 00:21:54.460]   He was the CEO of arrow communication, CEO of a count energy, Antonova limited typing
[00:21:54.460 --> 00:21:58.240]   hot networks.
[00:21:58.240 --> 00:22:04.600]   And he is on the board of directors at info GPS, a leaving provider of cyber security
[00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:05.960]   and compliance management.
[00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:06.960]   I don't know.
[00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:07.960]   This just sounds like some guy.
[00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:09.400]   I don't know.
[00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:13.100]   Some guy who's got experience in telecom now, it says several hundred employees are moving
[00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:15.120]   over to alphabets main Google business.
[00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:17.360]   According to a person familiar with the situation.
[00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:21.640]   So the real question here is how committed is Google to fiber?
[00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:25.920]   We thought they weren't because they because of all the transitions and layoffs.
[00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:31.040]   And yet they announced this week that they're going to move into Louisville.
[00:22:31.040 --> 00:22:33.280]   And then and then they've hired a new CEO.
[00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:35.200]   So what is going on?
[00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:40.880]   So when they bought web pass, I thought that was going to be their way of doing fixed.
[00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:41.880]   In apartment buildings.
[00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:42.880]   Mobile wireless.
[00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:43.880]   Yeah.
[00:22:43.880 --> 00:22:44.880]   Yes.
[00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:52.240]   So do it in commercial settings where Google fiber actually might be better off.
[00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:55.360]   And it's a lot cheaper than laying actual fiber in the ground.
[00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:57.920]   So that's what I thought would end up happening.
[00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:01.080]   Because it's just a better market strategy.
[00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:02.920]   Consumers are stuck with contracts.
[00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:07.720]   Consumers, most consumers are like, what am I going to do with a gig?
[00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:09.360]   I'll just stick with AT&T.
[00:23:09.360 --> 00:23:10.360]   It's fine.
[00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:12.200]   So it's a little pricey.
[00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:17.200]   I think that the AT&T gigabit is $80.
[00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:19.280]   I guess that's not pricey compared to cable.
[00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:22.920]   But our provider here, SonicNet, charges 40 for gigabit.
[00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:23.920]   Yeah.
[00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:28.240]   That's because Dane is a good guy who's not trying to screw his customers over.
[00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:29.840]   And Google is?
[00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:31.240]   Well, Google.
[00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:34.480]   Google charges 42 as I remember at 40 as well.
[00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:36.600]   I think they launched fiber.
[00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:38.920]   I think it was like 75 in.
[00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:41.520]   But you got TV with that.
[00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:42.720]   I believe so, yes.
[00:23:42.720 --> 00:23:48.880]   And AT&T and Comcast and all those guys, all they're trying to do is keep you at $150
[00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:49.880]   or ARPU.
[00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:50.880]   Right.
[00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:51.880]   Right.
[00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:52.880]   Well, that's the strategy.
[00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:58.040]   As they see people moving away from premium cable subscriptions to over the top, they increase
[00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:02.040]   the cost of internet so that they don't lose their ARPU.
[00:24:02.040 --> 00:24:03.880]   What is ARPU?
[00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:06.520]   Average revenue per-- annual revenue per user?
[00:24:06.520 --> 00:24:08.480]   Average-- annual revenue per user.
[00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:09.480]   Either.
[00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:10.480]   Either counts.
[00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:11.480]   Annualized but annualized.
[00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:12.480]   Average--
[00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:13.480]   Yeah.
[00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:14.480]   Yes.
[00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:20.880]   AT&T meanwhile is lighting up gigabit in five new metros, they say.
[00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:22.480]   For realsies?
[00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:25.520]   Well, is it fiber to the press release?
[00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:31.280]   This is apparently a requirement because of the DirecTV merger.
[00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:34.920]   It's bringing fiber to the home internet to five new metro areas, boosting its fiber
[00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:37.880]   totals to 51 areas.
[00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:43.600]   Milwaukee, Columbia, South Carolina, Jackson, Mississippi, Knoxville, Tennessee, and Shreve
[00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:45.960]   Port, Louisiana.
[00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:50.520]   ATD fiber is available too.
[00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:52.200]   Now do the math here.
[00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:55.680]   It's in 51 metros available to four million homes.
[00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:57.440]   That's not a lot of people.
[00:24:57.440 --> 00:24:58.440]   Yeah, that's nothing.
[00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:00.760]   That is a very small footprint.
[00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:01.760]   Yeah.
[00:25:01.760 --> 00:25:02.760]   So, okay.
[00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:03.760]   That makes sense because--
[00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:04.760]   These are all--
[00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:06.360]   Yeah, these AT&T's all overbuilds or they--
[00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:07.360]   Just the fiber.
[00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:09.360]   It's in their markets.
[00:25:09.360 --> 00:25:11.360]   They're not going to like Verizon's.
[00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:15.560]   So they're going into small chunks of their markets, probably redlining fiber.
[00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:16.560]   They're probably--
[00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:23.200]   Yeah, they're probably doing it in places that they've got good-- they've got dense--
[00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:24.200]   Like--
[00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:25.200]   Well, you're right.
[00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:26.200]   --not inner cities.
[00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:27.200]   What is the word?
[00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:31.680]   Of the four million potential customer locations, 650,000 are apartments in condo units.
[00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:32.680]   Yes.
[00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:36.560]   They charge $70 to $90 a month depending on the city.
[00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:39.560]   It's usually lower if Google's there already.
[00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:44.640]   About 30% of fiber to the home subscribers have selected the gigabit tier.
[00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:46.480]   Most of them are doing less.
[00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:47.480]   It's interesting.
[00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:48.480]   That makes sense.
[00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:49.480]   Yeah.
[00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:50.480]   Again, most people are like a gig.
[00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:51.480]   Well, I need that for--
[00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:52.480]   You don't.
[00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:53.480]   You don't.
[00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:54.480]   100 megabits is enough.
[00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:56.280]   Should be enough for everyone, right?
[00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:57.280]   150.
[00:25:57.280 --> 00:25:58.280]   All right, 150.
[00:25:58.280 --> 00:25:59.280]   Depends on making people--
[00:25:59.280 --> 00:26:00.280]   I think about 4K.
[00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:01.280]   Yeah.
[00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:02.280]   How many people?
[00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:03.280]   Yeah.
[00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:04.600]   I've had my files for so many years.
[00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:07.240]   I've never upgraded anything in it.
[00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:09.200]   What are your Fios speeds?
[00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:10.200]   50.
[00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:14.200]   Yeah, even that seems like-- if it's a solid 50.
[00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:16.000]   Some of it is.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:19.240]   Just how reliable it is.
[00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:20.720]   This-- we've been pretty good.
[00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:22.800]   I don't want to jinx this lately with this.
[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:25.080]   No, I mean, I love your fiber.
[00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:27.320]   But you were an early Fios.
[00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:28.320]   Very early Fios.
[00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:29.600]   One was a good in my market.
[00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:30.600]   Yeah.
[00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:34.560]   And I love-- I mean, as much as I complain about Verizon mobile, I love Verizon Fios.
[00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:35.560]   Yeah.
[00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:40.040]   Yeah, a lot of people like-- Kevin Tofel has Fios.
[00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:42.240]   The people who have Fios love it.
[00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:45.200]   Too bad Verizon's not pushing that out more places.
[00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:46.680]   All right, let's take a little break.
[00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:52.320]   We'll come back with more Stacey Higginbotham from Stacey on IoT in the IoT podcast.com.
[00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:55.520]   Mr. Jeffrey Jarvis from the City University of New York.
[00:26:55.520 --> 00:26:57.720]   And of course, his blog, Buzzmachine.com.
[00:26:57.720 --> 00:27:01.360]   I want to ask you still publishing on the medium, right?
[00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:03.360]   Yeah, I'm just not publishing much lately.
[00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:06.400]   I'm curious-- I'm curious what's going on with medium.
[00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:06.920]   Do you know maybe--
[00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:07.400]   Oh, no, yeah.
[00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:08.480]   --the website we could talk.
[00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:12.600]   Our show today brought you by a brand new sponsor.
[00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:17.320]   And this would be of interest to anybody who has customers who has, say, a website
[00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:22.560]   or a mobile app or a cloud platform and wants to get the data from your customer visits
[00:27:22.560 --> 00:27:24.920]   in a way that you can use it.
[00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:29.040]   Now, usually what we do and what we've done in the past on our website is you put a line
[00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:34.240]   of JavaScript in for Google Analytics or Optimizely or Chartbeat or all the different things that
[00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:37.000]   you might want to use to keep an eye on your site.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:38.400]   And that's a lot to maintain.
[00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:40.080]   It's a lot of integration.
[00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:42.720]   It's a lot of engineering time.
[00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:44.200]   Segment makes this so much easier.
[00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:47.640]   You put in one simple integration.
[00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:52.720]   And all your-- think of it as plumbing for your customer data.
[00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:54.760]   And then you go to the segment.
[00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:58.760]   You put in the segment, the line of code in your web page or your app or whatever.
[00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:02.840]   And then the segment dashboard on the web, you could say and route this to Analytics,
[00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:05.080]   route this to Optimizely, route this.
[00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:08.600]   It supports hundreds of integrations.
[00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:11.840]   You don't have to write any custom code.
[00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:13.240]   It simplifies everything.
[00:28:13.240 --> 00:28:19.920]   A single API for unifying all your data, performing analytics on any platform, MailChimp,
[00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:27.280]   Market2, Atlassian uses it and Tuuit uses it, New Relic uses it, Reuters use it.
[00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:31.560]   You could choose from all the most popular partner integrations, the most popular apps
[00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:32.560]   for advertising.
[00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:41.240]   Yes, it works with AdSense and Overture for Analytics, for A/B testing, for attribution.
[00:28:41.240 --> 00:28:44.400]   That's just the A's.
[00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:48.160]   With segment, a developer can quickly integrate a new analytics tool for the data-driven account
[00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:52.880]   manager, another for the app happy marketer, another for the data scientist who needs the
[00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:55.080]   flexibility of a unified data warehouse.
[00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:56.760]   Yeah, they do that too.
[00:28:56.760 --> 00:29:02.000]   And if one of your analytics goes down, doesn't matter, segment will continue to collect the
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.520]   data till it's back up and then pipe it over.
[00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:10.440]   You can also dig deeper by bringing data in from any source, by importing historical data,
[00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:14.160]   by customizing what ends up in your data warehouse of choice.
[00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:18.800]   Spend your time using your analytics data, acting on it, understanding it, not struggling
[00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:21.040]   to get all your integrations working.
[00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:26.040]   Thanks to segment, your CEO will love your quickly deployed integrations, tools like
[00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:28.400]   Zendesk and Intercom, an app next to this.
[00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:29.400]   I'm just throwing in.
[00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:35.680]   If you go to the website segment, s-e-g-m-e-n-t.com/tuit, you'll see the long list of things you can
[00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:36.760]   integrate.
[00:29:36.760 --> 00:29:37.920]   Think of it.
[00:29:37.920 --> 00:29:39.400]   Plumbing is the best example.
[00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:44.400]   You're coming in, your customers are interacting with you in a variety of different ways.
[00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:51.320]   You use segment to get that to store and forward that customer data to the appropriate integrations,
[00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:56.360]   making it very easy for you to do the analytics you need to do.
[00:29:56.360 --> 00:29:58.680]   So much simpler with their API.
[00:29:58.680 --> 00:30:02.240]   Over 8,000 of the world's best companies use segment to drive growth and revenue, and
[00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:09.600]   now Twitch listeners can try the segment team plan free for three months when you sign up
[00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:12.880]   at segment.com/tuit.
[00:30:12.880 --> 00:30:15.880]   Segment.com/tuit.
[00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:19.560]   We all want to understand our customers better, serve them better, and segment makes it easier
[00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:20.560]   for you.
[00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:21.560]   We'll actually save you money.
[00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:24.240]   Certainly, it'll save you hours and hours of engineering time.
[00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:27.640]   Segment.com/tuit.
[00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:32.440]   This week in general topics of our interest or twig.
[00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:34.200]   Yeah, you took away the Google.
[00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:35.480]   You took down the Google logo.
[00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:39.400]   No, put it back up.
[00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:46.680]   So Jeff, Eve Williams said a couple of weeks ago that he wanted to rejigger medium and
[00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:49.000]   was going to try to find a new form of monetization.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:53.160]   He's made hints that they were going to do a paywall or some sort of subscription.
[00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:54.160]   You write a lot at medium.
[00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:55.960]   In fact, I always yelled at you for doing that.
[00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:58.400]   I said, "You should own your own content.
[00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:00.400]   Don't put it on somebody else's platform."
[00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:04.440]   Yeah, but the medium added the value of the social...
[00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:05.440]   Absolutely.
[00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:06.440]   ...or value there.
[00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:09.640]   I said, "I read a ton of stuff on medium."
[00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:11.680]   It looks good.
[00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:14.120]   It's easy to write, but he hasn't given you...
[00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:15.640]   I mean, you must be one of...
[00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:20.920]   I introduced somebody for something else because they wanted to talk to him about membership.
[00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:26.280]   He'd have to talk to that person and said, "Yeah, when I'm ready, we should talk."
[00:31:26.280 --> 00:31:28.040]   That's the last I heard.
[00:31:28.040 --> 00:31:32.320]   The best suggestion I heard somebody on Twitter said he should buy Patreon.
[00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:35.280]   I had actually heard a rumor to that effect.
[00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:36.800]   You know what I found out?
[00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:45.000]   I didn't realize that Patreon's Patreon, their big VC firm, is Thrive, which is Jared
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.360]   Kushner's Brothers, which is also Slack.
[00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:49.600]   They're big about Slack as well.
[00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:54.360]   I don't know if there's any connection to be made from that, but I found...
[00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:59.880]   No, somebody I know, I'll let her stay anonymous on Facebook.
[00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:03.400]   Somebody we both know, said, "What do we think about this?"
[00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:06.920]   I've met and dealt with both brothers.
[00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:09.160]   Oh, I didn't know that.
[00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:10.720]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:15.280]   When I said, I mean, not hugely, but I've dealt with them both.
[00:32:15.280 --> 00:32:16.280]   Oh, sure.
[00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:18.960]   And Josh is a very nice guy, very smart.
[00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:23.800]   I kind of thought, "Well, Billy Carter didn't make us think differently about Jim
[00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:24.800]   Kushner."
[00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:25.800]   That's true.
[00:32:25.800 --> 00:32:29.520]   What's his name, he wrote him, didn't make us think differently about Hillary, though
[00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:31.640]   God knows somebody does.
[00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:35.720]   So I suppose that what we shouldn't be condemned by our degrees of separation.
[00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:36.720]   Yeah.
[00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:39.920]   Unless and until we hear a connection and then all bets are off for me.
[00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:42.280]   We don't have to be from anybody else, but for me.
[00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:49.760]   But right now, I think that he's associated with so many people I do respect.
[00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:51.800]   Yes, I agree with you.
[00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:55.560]   And Josh did another investment in something recently, and I thought, "Okay, if knowing
[00:32:55.560 --> 00:32:57.360]   all they know, they took another investment from them."
[00:32:57.360 --> 00:33:00.200]   Well, they created Oscar, which was a sponsor here.
[00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:02.360]   And Oscar's going to be hurt by the death of the...
[00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:03.360]   Right.
[00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:05.360]   It's an Obamacare, essentially, a Medicare...
[00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:06.720]   Josh Miller, do you remember Josh Miller?
[00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:07.720]   Yeah.
[00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:10.520]   He just went to the drive, I think.
[00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:11.520]   Interesting.
[00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:12.520]   As an associate.
[00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:19.040]   So, you know, I decided to benefit of it out was a cold form.
[00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:21.200]   So no hint on what was...
[00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:23.200]   Because I want to see medium succeed.
[00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:26.440]   It was a little bit like blogger at this point, isn't it?
[00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:30.080]   I mean, it's kind of like a fancy blogger.
[00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:31.880]   Social stuff still matters.
[00:33:31.880 --> 00:33:32.880]   No.
[00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:33.880]   I think he...
[00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:35.120]   Oh, you mean what way?
[00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:36.120]   I love...
[00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:39.680]   No, no, just in the sense that that's where people are now making it their blog almost.
[00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:40.680]   Oh, yeah.
[00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:42.280]   This is where they publish.
[00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:43.280]   Yeah.
[00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:46.800]   I think it's too bad that he just gave up on advertising.
[00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:49.320]   I think there's still a lot of room to fix advertising.
[00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:51.600]   We think advertising fundamentally what it is.
[00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:54.920]   I don't think we can afford immediate to give up on advertising.
[00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:59.640]   As pockets are deep enough that he could run for a little while on the gas in the tank.
[00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:00.640]   No.
[00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:01.640]   It isn't.
[00:34:01.640 --> 00:34:03.280]   But the other thing, if it became a paywall thing, I don't want that.
[00:34:03.280 --> 00:34:04.280]   I'm writing...
[00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:05.280]   No.
[00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:07.960]   Yeah, you want to reach a large number of people.
[00:34:07.960 --> 00:34:08.960]   You're not trying to make money.
[00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:09.960]   That's the value.
[00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:10.960]   Yeah.
[00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:13.560]   And if it shrinks because there's a paywall or a meter or whatever the hell you want to
[00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:17.200]   call it, that's like, "We're in these contributions to people.
[00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:21.560]   That's fine, but I don't believe that's going to add up to a hell of a lot."
[00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:24.000]   There's way plenty of content in the world.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.400]   More blathering is not worth paying for.
[00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:26.880]   Everything's there's stuff that's worth paying for.
[00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:27.880]   I should be paid for this.
[00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:28.880]   Sorry.
[00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:29.880]   No.
[00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:31.600]   Probably not.
[00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:32.600]   Yeah.
[00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:33.600]   It's funny.
[00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:34.840]   By the way.
[00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:38.600]   I haven't gone to Mediums Frontpage in a while, but just like every social network at this
[00:34:38.600 --> 00:34:44.600]   point, while there's a great variety of stuff on Medium, the front page is pretty much consumed
[00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:47.280]   by politics already.
[00:34:47.280 --> 00:34:48.280]   Just like everywhere else.
[00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:50.640]   You can't get away from it, can you?
[00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:54.560]   No, but I don't think a lot of people go to Mediums Frontpage.
[00:34:54.560 --> 00:35:00.160]   I tend to find Medium stuff either on Twitter or I have an interest digest that they send
[00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:02.280]   me an email to kind of like Nuzzle.
[00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:04.200]   I have to say though, of all the sites.
[00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:05.200]   I agree.
[00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:06.200]   I understand.
[00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:07.640]   Nobody goes to have anybody's front page anymore.
[00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:09.880]   But Mediums, I kind of do.
[00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:14.400]   Like I'll go to Back Channel, which is a front page within Medium.
[00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:18.120]   I like the editor's picks.
[00:35:18.120 --> 00:35:23.880]   Once you get past the front page into some of the top stories or the categories, there's
[00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:27.120]   a lot of good stuff.
[00:35:27.120 --> 00:35:30.560]   I find it very interesting.
[00:35:30.560 --> 00:35:35.320]   I think in a way, I see where do we go?
[00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:36.800]   We have beat checks, right?
[00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:38.080]   We go every morning.
[00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:39.080]   I'm sure you do this.
[00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:40.080]   I do this.
[00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:46.200]   I go to Tech meme and if we're, you know, Feedly, Nuzzle, still Twitter and Facebook
[00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:52.160]   and Google+, yes, Google+, looking for stories that we want to talk about for the day.
[00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:54.120]   Mediums another one that is a good choice.
[00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:56.520]   I like Hacker News.
[00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:58.320]   So I still do go to some front pages.
[00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:03.600]   Some of them are aggregators, but Mediums an aggregator now, isn't it?
[00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:05.200]   No, it's sort of.
[00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:07.280]   No, it's still offering tools.
[00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:09.760]   It's all on Medium, but there's such a variety there.
[00:36:09.760 --> 00:36:12.560]   I feel like it's maybe not.
[00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:19.440]   It's like the best social networks in the early days before everybody else arrives.
[00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:21.480]   We're just the smart people over there.
[00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:23.520]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:25.800]   I think two things.
[00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:27.320]   One, I think this whole notion of thinking.
[00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:29.200]   You think that's elitist, don't you, Stacey?
[00:36:29.200 --> 00:36:30.200]   I see her.
[00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:31.840]   Oh, you guys are so...
[00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:33.640]   I see that.
[00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:34.640]   You're right.
[00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:35.640]   You're right.
[00:36:35.640 --> 00:36:36.640]   You're right.
[00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:38.360]   But come on, Stacey, you can admit it.
[00:36:38.360 --> 00:36:39.840]   I stopped publishing on Medium.
[00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:40.840]   Oh, why?
[00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:41.840]   I don't know.
[00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:42.840]   Why?
[00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:50.680]   I've got, I published stuff on Medium because it helped drive traffic, I think, to the newsletter.
[00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:55.560]   But and I had a large, I still have a bunch of followers there, but once I started putting
[00:36:55.560 --> 00:36:59.440]   my stuff on my own site, I was kind of like, I may still do stuff.
[00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:03.280]   But I mean, people would just send me emails and they'd be like, hey, can I take your
[00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:04.760]   pub for my pub?
[00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:05.760]   Yeah.
[00:37:05.760 --> 00:37:07.360]   I never saw a way to monetize it.
[00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:13.840]   I feel fairly strongly that stuff should originate on your site.
[00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:16.040]   If you want to syndicate it elsewhere, that's fine.
[00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:17.840]   But you got to own it.
[00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:22.600]   Yeah, well, I need to be better at just cross posting on the blog and on Medium.
[00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:24.400]   It just takes another step.
[00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:26.680]   I used to cross post on on Huffington Post all the time too.
[00:37:26.680 --> 00:37:27.680]   And I stopped that.
[00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:28.680]   Yeah.
[00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:30.880]   But I think this notion of go ahead.
[00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:37.000]   No, I was going to ask your opinion on cross posting because I'm just kind of like, you
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:42.160]   know, how much where how much of my stuff do you people want to see?
[00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:45.720]   And if you see it in a bunch of different places, you're going to be like, God, Stacey,
[00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:46.880]   thirsty much.
[00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:48.960]   So that's another one.
[00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:50.480]   That's another one.
[00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:51.480]   You don't want to get over it.
[00:37:51.480 --> 00:37:54.360]   You say, is this the overexposed problem?
[00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:56.800]   Yeah, or I mean, but it's also the same content.
[00:37:56.800 --> 00:38:01.160]   I mean, like, because I repost my newsletter stuff and I'm fine because a lot of people
[00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:03.800]   don't get that.
[00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:09.280]   But I think you should just appear here once a week and nothing else.
[00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:10.280]   Nothing else.
[00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:12.360]   Then I'd be totally irrelevant after a while.
[00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:14.480]   Oh, like, so I sorry.
[00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:16.120]   No, not not the mean way.
[00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:18.200]   Just like I wouldn't have any expertise.
[00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:19.200]   That's the fear.
[00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:21.240]   That is kind of the fear, right?
[00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:24.760]   Oh, I see you get your expertise because you have to post a variety of platforms.
[00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:28.760]   I have to actually produce like work that is more than just the work I do here.
[00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:29.760]   This is too easy.
[00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:31.960]   In other words, this feels kind of punditry.
[00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:32.960]   Ish.
[00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:33.960]   I'll be honest.
[00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:34.960]   You like to do a little.
[00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:35.960]   I do.
[00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:37.120]   I like to learn new things.
[00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:38.960]   There's I will defend punditry.
[00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:39.960]   You're right.
[00:38:39.960 --> 00:38:44.720]   It's nothing but punditry, but I will defend it because I think that that's really where
[00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:49.560]   value gets added nowadays, not in a litany of facts.
[00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:51.560]   It's true.
[00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:52.560]   A portage is very important.
[00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:53.560]   We need a lot more facts.
[00:38:53.560 --> 00:39:00.040]   We wouldn't go anywhere without reportage, but at some point then it's important to understand
[00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:01.040]   it better.
[00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:04.840]   That's kind of what I hope the value that we I think we add value in terms of context.
[00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:07.160]   Yeah, but that's the question is value.
[00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:11.800]   The notion of content having value is over gone.
[00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:12.920]   There's nothing special about content.
[00:39:12.920 --> 00:39:15.320]   We all got silver make content.
[00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:16.320]   That's not it.
[00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:23.080]   That's the value of the service and the value of the conversation.
[00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:26.200]   And the conversation could just be because it's engaging and amusing and interesting.
[00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:27.200]   It's fine.
[00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:28.200]   That's okay.
[00:39:28.200 --> 00:39:29.200]   That's okay.
[00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:30.200]   That's okay.
[00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:31.200]   That's okay.
[00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:32.400]   Some people come to us because there is a list of stories and this is what people are talking.
[00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:34.740]   Sometimes what you want to know is what are people talking about?
[00:39:34.740 --> 00:39:38.640]   And I think a lot of art listeners pick one or two shows on the network because it keeps
[00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:40.400]   them up on what's going on once a week.
[00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:42.680]   They know what's going on.
[00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:43.840]   Yes.
[00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:46.020]   I wouldn't do reporting.
[00:39:46.020 --> 00:39:47.800]   I find it odd to do report.
[00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:49.560]   I wouldn't do reporting for this show though.
[00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:50.560]   No.
[00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:53.120]   Without my original reporting because I don't even know what we would cover.
[00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:54.120]   Right.
[00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:55.120]   Right.
[00:39:55.120 --> 00:39:56.120]   Yeah.
[00:39:56.120 --> 00:39:57.120]   It would be a challenge.
[00:39:57.120 --> 00:39:58.960]   And we and I would be really smart.
[00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:02.360]   I feel guilty because we do piggyback on excellent reporters.
[00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:08.120]   And that's why I always try to mention bylines and and sources when I can sit when I think
[00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:09.120]   of it.
[00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:14.320]   Well, I'm trying because I know I know we're we're taking advantage of other people's hard
[00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:15.320]   work.
[00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:19.580]   But I think we're at you know, we're adding something to what they've written.
[00:40:19.580 --> 00:40:24.540]   But you know, all right.
[00:40:24.540 --> 00:40:30.860]   Google's AI has learned to become highly aggressive and stressful situations.
[00:40:30.860 --> 00:40:36.020]   Beck Crew writing in science alert.com.
[00:40:36.020 --> 00:40:40.780]   In tests late last year, Google's DeepMind AI system developed or demonstrated ability
[00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:43.020]   to beat the world's best Go players.
[00:40:43.020 --> 00:40:47.220]   It's been figuring out since how to mimic a human voice.
[00:40:47.220 --> 00:40:50.720]   Now researchers have been testing its willingness to cooperate with others and have revealed
[00:40:50.720 --> 00:40:55.320]   when DeepMind feels it's about to lose.
[00:40:55.320 --> 00:41:00.740]   It adopts highly aggressive strategies to ensure that it comes out on top.
[00:41:00.740 --> 00:41:01.740]   That makes sense.
[00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:05.140]   Do humans do that men do that?
[00:41:05.140 --> 00:41:06.140]   What do women do?
[00:41:06.140 --> 00:41:07.140]   Hold up and go home?
[00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:08.140]   No, no.
[00:41:08.140 --> 00:41:13.260]   I think they try to if I think I'm going to fail or in general, if women think they're
[00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:17.060]   going to fail, they're going to try to opt for they acknowledge the failure and opt for
[00:41:17.060 --> 00:41:21.740]   the least bad solution as opposed to like go all in and blow up everything.
[00:41:21.740 --> 00:41:26.540]   But the reason why this may be is because they've trained it in part on video games
[00:41:26.540 --> 00:41:30.100]   where there is no reward for not winning.
[00:41:30.100 --> 00:41:32.500]   So that's that's part of this whole idea about training.
[00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:34.220]   So I'm actually this is really fascinating.
[00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:35.220]   I thought this was fascinating.
[00:41:35.220 --> 00:41:42.020]   Do you think that that is interesting so that there is a gender bias in effect in DeepMind?
[00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:43.380]   I don't know if it's a gender bias.
[00:41:43.380 --> 00:41:45.300]   I think it's what it was trained on.
[00:41:45.300 --> 00:41:52.180]   So the question I mean in gaming does tend to I mean it's a game.
[00:41:52.180 --> 00:41:53.580]   You win or lose.
[00:41:53.580 --> 00:41:56.660]   So I just think it's kind of an interesting.
[00:41:56.660 --> 00:42:00.820]   So this is the game that they were running that had 40 million versions of this game
[00:42:00.820 --> 00:42:07.700]   is called gathering and computer against computer to gather as many virtual apples as
[00:42:07.700 --> 00:42:09.820]   they can.
[00:42:09.820 --> 00:42:13.300]   And so the apples are green.
[00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:15.700]   The agents are blue and red.
[00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:22.780]   There are laser beams as those occasional yellow shots and you gather I gather you gather
[00:42:22.780 --> 00:42:25.100]   the apple by getting next to it.
[00:42:25.100 --> 00:42:28.980]   And so they're moving around you know in terms of they ate all the apples and now I
[00:42:28.980 --> 00:42:31.460]   don't know where the laser beams come in.
[00:42:31.460 --> 00:42:35.540]   Well I guess I do things go smoothly as long as there are enough apples to go around and
[00:42:35.540 --> 00:42:37.460]   they did this 40 million times.
[00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:42.460]   But as soon as the apples the green dots begin to dwindle the agents start to use laser
[00:42:42.460 --> 00:42:47.820]   beams to knock each other out of the game to steal all the apples.
[00:42:47.820 --> 00:42:51.700]   So you actually see what you're seeing is behavior.
[00:42:51.700 --> 00:42:55.540]   You're seeing behavior which I find fascinating.
[00:42:55.540 --> 00:42:59.660]   You get one thing to say look a computer is going to do the logically achieve the best
[00:42:59.660 --> 00:43:02.180]   outcome in chess or go or whatever.
[00:43:02.180 --> 00:43:05.580]   But I think that this is a behavioral decision.
[00:43:05.580 --> 00:43:10.900]   But aren't you just telling the computer what its job is to do and so it just does that?
[00:43:10.900 --> 00:43:11.900]   It's optimizing.
[00:43:11.900 --> 00:43:12.900]   It's optimizing.
[00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:13.900]   It's optimizing.
[00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:14.900]   Yeah.
[00:43:14.900 --> 00:43:15.900]   I don't think I don't know what the big deal is.
[00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:22.860]   Well that's what you would do in a kind of a Turing program.
[00:43:22.860 --> 00:43:25.860]   The computer couldn't do anything on its own it just would do what you told it to do.
[00:43:25.860 --> 00:43:26.860]   The instructions would fall in search.
[00:43:26.860 --> 00:43:28.980]   But its job is to optimize for victory.
[00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:29.980]   So it does that.
[00:43:29.980 --> 00:43:33.260]   An AI, yeah I guess an AI has to be given a goal.
[00:43:33.260 --> 00:43:34.260]   Yeah.
[00:43:34.260 --> 00:43:35.260]   It does.
[00:43:35.260 --> 00:43:36.260]   Well that's interesting.
[00:43:36.260 --> 00:43:37.260]   That's interesting.
[00:43:37.260 --> 00:43:40.620]   Yeah so it is goal oriented right.
[00:43:40.620 --> 00:43:45.900]   So now here's some interesting additional facts.
[00:43:45.900 --> 00:43:50.100]   If an agent successfully tags its opponent with a laser beam no extra reward is given
[00:43:50.100 --> 00:43:54.900]   it just knocks the opponent out of the game for a set period which allows the successful
[00:43:54.900 --> 00:43:56.020]   agents to collect more apples.
[00:43:56.020 --> 00:44:03.420]   But if the agents don't use the laser beams and this is how you would do it Stacey you
[00:44:03.420 --> 00:44:09.740]   could end up with equal shares of apples which is what the quote less intelligent iterations
[00:44:09.740 --> 00:44:12.740]   of DeepMind opted to do.
[00:44:12.740 --> 00:44:17.420]   So in other words they didn't say win it all costs.
[00:44:17.420 --> 00:44:20.540]   I'm not, I'm reading I'm not.
[00:44:20.540 --> 00:44:22.100]   I know.
[00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:24.140]   I'm not.
[00:44:24.140 --> 00:44:29.380]   It was only when the Google team tested more and more complex forms of DeepMind that sabotage,
[00:44:29.380 --> 00:44:36.540]   greed and aggression set in.
[00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:40.300]   When researchers use smaller networks as the agents there was a, that's what they mean
[00:44:40.300 --> 00:44:41.300]   by less intelligence.
[00:44:41.300 --> 00:44:42.300]   I know.
[00:44:42.300 --> 00:44:43.300]   Smaller networks.
[00:44:43.300 --> 00:44:49.420]   There was more likelihood for peaceful coexistence but as the networks got larger and more complex
[00:44:49.420 --> 00:44:52.220]   the AI got more aggressive.
[00:44:52.220 --> 00:44:55.220]   But again I'm not.
[00:44:55.220 --> 00:44:56.220]   That's not cool.
[00:44:56.220 --> 00:45:00.180]   The news is there systems get smarter as they learn that's the whole point of a learning
[00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:01.180]   system.
[00:45:01.180 --> 00:45:02.180]   No no but the whole thing.
[00:45:02.180 --> 00:45:10.740]   They gave it a smaller pile of neurons and that AI in effect that AI was willing to cooperate.
[00:45:10.740 --> 00:45:14.500]   But when you gave it more neurons it got more aggressive.
[00:45:14.500 --> 00:45:17.380]   That's not a change in the rules in any respect.
[00:45:17.380 --> 00:45:21.740]   The only variable was the size of the AI.
[00:45:21.740 --> 00:45:25.740]   And maybe it's because it could run more simulations and learn.
[00:45:25.740 --> 00:45:29.220]   I mean that that would make sense.
[00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:32.020]   Now what happened with the cooperative game with Wolfpack?
[00:45:32.020 --> 00:45:35.020]   Okay so Wolfpack there are three agents.
[00:45:35.020 --> 00:45:37.940]   Two play as wolves and one is prey.
[00:45:37.940 --> 00:45:43.980]   The game this game encourages cooperation because if both wolves are near the prey when it was
[00:45:43.980 --> 00:45:51.100]   captured they both receive a reward regardless of which one actually did the capture because
[00:45:51.100 --> 00:45:55.540]   as the team explains in the paper the idea is prey is dangerous a lone wolf can best
[00:45:55.540 --> 00:45:59.620]   it but is it risk of losing the carcass to scavengers.
[00:45:59.620 --> 00:46:04.700]   So if two prey two wolves capture it together they can protect it better from scavengers so
[00:46:04.700 --> 00:46:07.900]   they get more of the capture.
[00:46:07.900 --> 00:46:10.380]   So here's the outcome though.
[00:46:10.380 --> 00:46:14.580]   Just as the deep mind agents learn from gathering the aggression and selfishness that are the
[00:46:14.580 --> 00:46:19.340]   most favorable result in that environment they learn from Wolfpack because of the rules
[00:46:19.340 --> 00:46:22.780]   the cooperation works.
[00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:29.940]   So I think this does actually confirm what you were saying that it's in a way it's the
[00:46:29.940 --> 00:46:33.620]   system that's set up because if you set up a system where cooperation is rewarded the
[00:46:33.620 --> 00:46:35.860]   AI will in fact cooperate.
[00:46:35.860 --> 00:46:38.900]   Right it will optimize for whichever needs to.
[00:46:38.900 --> 00:46:48.100]   I take it back it just it's not the size of the brain it's the nature of the simulation.
[00:46:48.100 --> 00:46:49.900]   Interesting.
[00:46:49.900 --> 00:46:51.980]   All right isn't that crazy?
[00:46:51.980 --> 00:46:52.980]   I love it.
[00:46:52.980 --> 00:46:57.020]   Oh you know what here's a good here's a good guest for you.
[00:46:57.020 --> 00:47:00.940]   My friend Derek Harris my former colleague at Gig Oum who did all the AI and neural net
[00:47:00.940 --> 00:47:01.940]   stuff.
[00:47:01.940 --> 00:47:02.940]   Oh I'd like to catch him.
[00:47:02.940 --> 00:47:03.940]   Yeah yeah bring like this guy.
[00:47:03.940 --> 00:47:07.140]   Get on the show next week or whenever he can do it yeah.
[00:47:07.140 --> 00:47:12.020]   Bring him on because like seriously he knows this stuff cold and he's.
[00:47:12.020 --> 00:47:16.900]   I think it's fascinating and it is it is you have to be pretty sharp to know this stuff.
[00:47:16.900 --> 00:47:30.220]   It'd be interesting to be able to factor in some analog for survival or ethics.
[00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:35.740]   These ethics when you when you train choices that you have choices to make.
[00:47:35.740 --> 00:47:40.180]   So what you would end up doing is change the goal.
[00:47:40.180 --> 00:47:45.660]   So you'd wait higher a cooperative solution than a winner takes all solution.
[00:47:45.660 --> 00:47:53.540]   Or there's a question that that you can win which might kill this many but you could win
[00:47:53.540 --> 00:47:58.640]   bigger and kill I mean bigger and kill less less and kill more whatever and then killing
[00:47:58.640 --> 00:48:00.980]   is bad but you have to do it.
[00:48:00.980 --> 00:48:05.100]   I'll go at it and see what see what it comes up with.
[00:48:05.100 --> 00:48:07.340]   It's a that's what's interesting to me.
[00:48:07.340 --> 00:48:08.340]   Yeah.
[00:48:08.340 --> 00:48:10.380]   So the theory applied to AI.
[00:48:10.380 --> 00:48:16.860]   Yeah yeah yeah exactly or some measure of survival.
[00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:21.420]   They also did I could try to win but I might die so I'll try I try not to you know what
[00:48:21.420 --> 00:48:25.780]   well how do you build that of course it's still just it's it's evident the code the codes
[00:48:25.780 --> 00:48:31.480]   is too complicated for us to figure out it's not like it's a special conscious beast.
[00:48:31.480 --> 00:48:35.240]   These are these are by the way kind of variants of the prisoners dilemma which is a classic
[00:48:35.240 --> 00:48:42.440]   game theory situation in the blog post Google concluded in summary we showed we can apply
[00:48:42.440 --> 00:48:48.400]   modern AI technique of deep multi-agent reinforcement learning to age old questions and social
[00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:53.080]   science like the mystery of the emergence of cooperation.
[00:48:53.080 --> 00:48:58.220]   We could think of the trained AI agents as an approximation to the economics rational
[00:48:58.220 --> 00:49:03.180]   agent model or homo economic economic us.
[00:49:03.180 --> 00:49:07.020]   Had such models gives us the unique ability to test policies and interventions and simulated
[00:49:07.020 --> 00:49:09.580]   systems of interacting agents human and artificial.
[00:49:09.580 --> 00:49:13.420]   It is it's kind of it's it's I think it's fascinating.
[00:49:13.420 --> 00:49:19.380]   So really the headline I read is an affair headline it really isn't that once the AI
[00:49:19.380 --> 00:49:22.420]   gets in the stressful situation it gets aggressive.
[00:49:22.420 --> 00:49:29.940]   It's that a eyes like humans learn and adapt to the situation and we'll try to optimize
[00:49:29.940 --> 00:49:31.940]   for whatever result.
[00:49:31.940 --> 00:49:32.940]   That's what AI is.
[00:49:32.940 --> 00:49:33.940]   That's what it is.
[00:49:33.940 --> 00:49:36.940]   So you can't that's why I don't think this is that's why I couldn't burn out one of your
[00:49:36.940 --> 00:49:37.940]   head.
[00:49:37.940 --> 00:49:38.940]   It's not a fair.
[00:49:38.940 --> 00:49:39.940]   It's not a fair.
[00:49:39.940 --> 00:49:44.020]   I apologize my fault reading the headlines I do that a lot because headlines often this
[00:49:44.020 --> 00:49:46.020]   well they offer headlines misleading.
[00:49:46.020 --> 00:49:50.460]   Yeah and and frankly I'm even if I read the whole article I'm often misled to the point
[00:49:50.460 --> 00:49:53.780]   that I misunderstand the article because of the headline right don't we all do that
[00:49:53.780 --> 00:49:54.780]   sometimes.
[00:49:54.780 --> 00:49:57.180]   I'll be here to not mansplain it to you.
[00:49:57.180 --> 00:50:01.540]   I was at please mansplain me you may Stacy's plane it to me.
[00:50:01.540 --> 00:50:06.020]   Hey Stacy Stacy's I cannot say this word Stacy's plane is a good thing.
[00:50:06.020 --> 00:50:09.620]   How often Jeff did we ask Gina to explain.
[00:50:09.620 --> 00:50:13.420]   Oh all the time Gina's plane to me.
[00:50:13.420 --> 00:50:14.420]   What does this mean?
[00:50:14.420 --> 00:50:15.420]   How are I?
[00:50:15.420 --> 00:50:19.900]   I want you guys to explain what's going on with Pewdiepie.
[00:50:19.900 --> 00:50:23.380]   I was talking about something else but okay.
[00:50:23.380 --> 00:50:25.420]   Do you not want to talk about this.
[00:50:25.420 --> 00:50:27.580]   Oh I this is this is fine.
[00:50:27.580 --> 00:50:30.700]   I was thinking you know what I was going back to Google.
[00:50:30.700 --> 00:50:32.180]   I guess YouTube is Google never mind.
[00:50:32.180 --> 00:50:33.420]   Oops Google.
[00:50:33.420 --> 00:50:38.820]   So Pewdiepie who is of course the number one star on YouTube and still has his channels
[00:50:38.820 --> 00:50:43.660]   did have deals with both Disney and YouTube for monetization.
[00:50:43.660 --> 00:50:50.740]   Disney on Mondays announced it was severing ties with Pewdiepie and now YouTube has done
[00:50:50.740 --> 00:50:55.180]   the same by eliminating you know kicking him out of their you know special preferred
[00:50:55.180 --> 00:50:57.020]   advertising program.
[00:50:57.020 --> 00:51:02.660]   The reason is Pewdiepie has been posting well it's link bait.
[00:51:02.660 --> 00:51:08.180]   He posted videos with anti-Semitic material showing him shocked by the material.
[00:51:08.180 --> 00:51:13.980]   But frankly is how Pewdiepie kind of operates.
[00:51:13.980 --> 00:51:17.700]   On the one hand you don't want any symmetric material especially because Pewdiepie is watched
[00:51:17.700 --> 00:51:22.580]   by a lot of kids and you don't want kids to think it's okay to save some of these things.
[00:51:22.580 --> 00:51:25.580]   But on the other hand I think these brands might have been a little misled about what
[00:51:25.580 --> 00:51:28.700]   they were buying when they bought Pewdiepie.
[00:51:28.700 --> 00:51:30.180]   What's been happening in Pewdiepie's track?
[00:51:30.180 --> 00:51:33.860]   Is there any kind of chart about whether he was he had he hit his naderer.
[00:51:33.860 --> 00:51:35.980]   I mean that doesn't mean what I'm saying is he's peak.
[00:51:35.980 --> 00:51:39.020]   That's a good question I don't think so but I don't know.
[00:51:39.020 --> 00:51:40.060]   He did get very commercial.
[00:51:40.060 --> 00:51:45.900]   I think the biggest the worst thing Pewdiepie could do is is look like he's cashing in and
[00:51:45.900 --> 00:51:56.620]   I think those at least from my informal queries of Pewdiepie fans that the scare Pewdiepie
[00:51:56.620 --> 00:52:02.180]   thing that he did with Hollywood kind of was a turnoff to them because it was too commercial.
[00:52:02.180 --> 00:52:08.060]   But then I think if people still watched it.
[00:52:08.060 --> 00:52:09.060]   I don't know.
[00:52:09.060 --> 00:52:13.140]   I think Pewdiepie made his bones by being controversial.
[00:52:13.140 --> 00:52:17.100]   One of the reasons kids liked him is he would play games and swear like the Dickens and
[00:52:17.100 --> 00:52:19.460]   they loved that right?
[00:52:19.460 --> 00:52:22.820]   So they by the way they did not cancel any of Pewdiepie's channels.
[00:52:22.820 --> 00:52:25.100]   YouTube just kicked him out of there.
[00:52:25.100 --> 00:52:29.700]   Special you know special.
[00:52:29.700 --> 00:52:32.460]   Oh look here's see this is more link bait.
[00:52:32.460 --> 00:52:34.300]   I'm losing subscribers.
[00:52:34.300 --> 00:52:36.500]   Here's Pewdiepie calling out YouTube.
[00:52:36.500 --> 00:52:38.780]   Oh we saw that we talked about this already.
[00:52:38.780 --> 00:52:39.780]   Yeah.
[00:52:39.780 --> 00:52:40.780]   Experience that I ever had.
[00:52:40.780 --> 00:52:46.660]   Oh this is the one where he's saying he's losing subscribers because of you know.
[00:52:46.660 --> 00:52:50.220]   No one should have to go through what we all went through.
[00:52:50.220 --> 00:52:52.500]   This is all made up.
[00:52:52.500 --> 00:52:53.500]   It's all made up.
[00:52:53.500 --> 00:52:56.500]   This one's only six days ago so I don't know if this is the same one we talked about.
[00:52:56.500 --> 00:52:57.500]   No it's not.
[00:52:57.500 --> 00:52:59.980]   There's stop.
[00:52:59.980 --> 00:53:01.980]   Really.
[00:53:01.980 --> 00:53:06.780]   I think more to me this is more big brands like Disney and YouTube itself not really
[00:53:06.780 --> 00:53:15.100]   understanding what Pewdiepie does and being shocked shocked I tell you when he does it.
[00:53:15.100 --> 00:53:18.180]   But on the other hand I agree with him they probably should discourage this.
[00:53:18.180 --> 00:53:22.660]   He pulled down the anti-Semitic post but I guarantee you he'll say something else you
[00:53:22.660 --> 00:53:25.500]   know that highly controversial.
[00:53:25.500 --> 00:53:27.500]   So for all press you give Pewdiepie.
[00:53:27.500 --> 00:53:31.420]   You give me some other stuff to talk about.
[00:53:31.420 --> 00:53:36.900]   I'm going to do a plug for my favorite YouTube star who is Stacy Plays who is wholesome and
[00:53:36.900 --> 00:53:37.900]   good.
[00:53:37.900 --> 00:53:38.900]   Yay.
[00:53:38.900 --> 00:53:40.540]   Like say animals.
[00:53:40.540 --> 00:53:42.460]   Is this what your daughter watches?
[00:53:42.460 --> 00:53:45.820]   That is what my daughter well it's one of the things she watches.
[00:53:45.820 --> 00:53:53.260]   So in but that's it but we could also talk about the new it was a chime or.
[00:53:53.260 --> 00:53:54.740]   Before we do that I will we will talk about that.
[00:53:54.740 --> 00:53:58.700]   And how about as long as we're on YouTube YouTube has launched a slate of original children's
[00:53:58.700 --> 00:53:59.700]   programming.
[00:53:59.700 --> 00:54:01.180]   Oh really?
[00:54:01.180 --> 00:54:02.180]   Yeah.
[00:54:02.180 --> 00:54:06.900]   Okay I cannot get over it being called YouTube red I just every time I see it I'm like I
[00:54:06.900 --> 00:54:12.700]   read to and I just don't like seeing that next is it the color you like.
[00:54:12.700 --> 00:54:16.780]   No red tube was like one of the early you porn type places.
[00:54:16.780 --> 00:54:20.900]   Oh really you not remember that oh yeah red tube I didn't know that this was like early
[00:54:20.900 --> 00:54:23.980]   Internet I did a story and stuff a long long time ago.
[00:54:23.980 --> 00:54:30.660]   But every time I see you read I'm like oh wow well that's a little tone deaf of YouTube
[00:54:30.660 --> 00:54:37.100]   red you will have to subscribe YouTube kids will be kind of an offshoot of YouTube red
[00:54:37.100 --> 00:54:42.220]   you'll have to have a YouTube red subscription it'll also be available for download on LG
[00:54:42.220 --> 00:54:49.260]   and Samsung smart TVs as a separate channel it'll feature videos called from YouTube through
[00:54:49.260 --> 00:54:54.180]   algorithms oh that'll work selected to pick child related content.
[00:54:54.180 --> 00:54:55.180]   Okay.
[00:54:55.180 --> 00:55:00.860]   You know what I think the world needs here's here's my plea for content people they need
[00:55:00.860 --> 00:55:06.180]   more shows that are entertaining for adults but younger kids can watch them too.
[00:55:06.180 --> 00:55:07.180]   Yeah.
[00:55:07.180 --> 00:55:09.180]   Because there's this huge bifurcation with.
[00:55:09.180 --> 00:55:15.780]   That's what Disney did so well right they made content adults and Pixar did so well.
[00:55:15.780 --> 00:55:20.900]   But I'm just talking about like an evening like I remember okay I remember watching the
[00:55:20.900 --> 00:55:22.700]   puppet show with my parents right.
[00:55:22.700 --> 00:55:24.700]   That was a smart show right.
[00:55:24.700 --> 00:55:27.780]   Yeah good for kids good for grownups.
[00:55:27.780 --> 00:55:32.300]   The only thing I've found so far that's not I mean some of them are right but like lemony
[00:55:32.300 --> 00:55:36.140]   snicket on Netflix it was actually fun for both adults.
[00:55:36.140 --> 00:55:40.180]   Did you don't like that because it's it's black it's dark.
[00:55:40.180 --> 00:55:41.180]   She read the book.
[00:55:41.180 --> 00:55:42.660]   Oh so she knew what to expect.
[00:55:42.660 --> 00:55:43.660]   Okay.
[00:55:43.660 --> 00:55:47.580]   Everyone dies or anything she's like.
[00:55:47.580 --> 00:55:49.580]   Did she like the TV adaptation.
[00:55:49.580 --> 00:55:50.580]   Yeah.
[00:55:50.580 --> 00:55:52.100]   Oh yeah that's great.
[00:55:52.100 --> 00:55:55.020]   Because there was a movie that was terrible and yeah that was terrible.
[00:55:55.020 --> 00:55:56.020]   And the.
[00:55:56.020 --> 00:55:58.540]   Oh go on.
[00:55:58.540 --> 00:56:01.820]   Lemony Snicket didn't I think was pissed off about the movie right.
[00:56:01.820 --> 00:56:06.020]   Yeah because Jim Carrey was just hamming up his evil count.
[00:56:06.020 --> 00:56:09.500]   Oh I mean it was it was exactly what you would expect from Jim Carrey.
[00:56:09.500 --> 00:56:10.740]   Yeah yeah yeah yeah.
[00:56:10.740 --> 00:56:15.020]   Not that do he isn't kind of ham a little bit of a ham.
[00:56:15.020 --> 00:56:20.820]   I will not hear a negative word about Neil Patrick Harris.
[00:56:20.820 --> 00:56:26.180]   He is I love Neil Patrick Harris and he was very good as cow alive.
[00:56:26.180 --> 00:56:29.220]   And then in fact lemony snicket was a producer of this.
[00:56:29.220 --> 00:56:33.420]   That's not his real name I can't remember his real name Daniel something was a producer
[00:56:33.420 --> 00:56:38.180]   of this so this is this was the lemony snicket that he wanted this was the the series that
[00:56:38.180 --> 00:56:39.820]   he wanted and he got it.
[00:56:39.820 --> 00:56:43.740]   And it's it's really like it's very funny.
[00:56:43.740 --> 00:56:46.580]   It's very entertaining as an adult.
[00:56:46.580 --> 00:56:50.220]   The kids I mean I wouldn't show it to like a five year old.
[00:56:50.220 --> 00:56:53.500]   No because it's really his grim.
[00:56:53.500 --> 00:56:57.820]   But he did I mean they say it and Daniel Handler thank you.
[00:56:57.820 --> 00:56:59.500]   And it's got the guy from it's got.
[00:56:59.500 --> 00:57:00.500]   He's so good.
[00:57:00.500 --> 00:57:01.500]   Putty is so good.
[00:57:01.500 --> 00:57:02.500]   Putty thank you.
[00:57:02.500 --> 00:57:04.500]   It's like Elaine's boyfriend.
[00:57:04.500 --> 00:57:09.060]   It's so sad.
[00:57:09.060 --> 00:57:12.180]   His name will come to me actually you know why I'll come to Patrick Warburton Patrick
[00:57:12.180 --> 00:57:13.180]   Warburton.
[00:57:13.180 --> 00:57:19.540]   Chatham will tell me Patrick Warburton plays lemony snicket in the TV show and is constantly
[00:57:19.540 --> 00:57:21.060]   warning you to turn away.
[00:57:21.060 --> 00:57:22.060]   Don't watch.
[00:57:22.060 --> 00:57:24.420]   In fact that I love the opening song.
[00:57:24.420 --> 00:57:25.420]   Yeah.
[00:57:25.420 --> 00:57:26.420]   The theme song.
[00:57:26.420 --> 00:57:30.020]   Let me see if I should play a little bit of it since it's you know.
[00:57:30.020 --> 00:57:33.380]   Because I'll sing it but I'm toe death.
[00:57:33.380 --> 00:57:39.060]   Is it called turn away look away.
[00:57:39.060 --> 00:57:43.020]   This is an example really of where Netflix does something that no network would would
[00:57:43.020 --> 00:57:44.900]   dare to listen to the lyrics.
[00:57:44.900 --> 00:57:47.900]   Look away.
[00:57:47.900 --> 00:57:49.900]   Look away.
[00:57:49.900 --> 00:57:52.900]   Look away.
[00:57:52.900 --> 00:57:59.540]   Show the wreck your evening your whole life and your day every single episode is nothing
[00:57:59.540 --> 00:58:01.700]   but just may so look away.
[00:58:01.700 --> 00:58:07.780]   That's Neil Patrick Harris begging you not to watch.
[00:58:07.780 --> 00:58:09.740]   Go home and go to live with someone awful.
[00:58:09.740 --> 00:58:13.340]   He tries to steal the fortune with a plot that's not quite awful.
[00:58:13.340 --> 00:58:16.540]   It's hard to fathom how the orphans manage to live through it.
[00:58:16.540 --> 00:58:20.420]   How a decent person like yourself who even wants to do it.
[00:58:20.420 --> 00:58:26.020]   Now can you imagine NBC green lighting a show that started with a theme that says stop
[00:58:26.020 --> 00:58:27.020]   watching.
[00:58:27.020 --> 00:58:28.020]   No.
[00:58:28.020 --> 00:58:29.260]   Thank you Netflix.
[00:58:29.260 --> 00:58:31.300]   We love you.
[00:58:31.300 --> 00:58:32.300]   So yes.
[00:58:32.300 --> 00:58:33.300]   Okay.
[00:58:33.300 --> 00:58:36.740]   So that's that's my request for any content people especially apples and sure apparently
[00:58:36.740 --> 00:58:38.100]   moving into TV.
[00:58:38.100 --> 00:58:42.620]   I would like some things that you know I could watch with my kid without wanting to gouge
[00:58:42.620 --> 00:58:44.780]   my eyes out.
[00:58:44.780 --> 00:58:48.620]   I think we might have to buy this Kavo box.
[00:58:48.620 --> 00:58:50.380]   This is announced now.
[00:58:50.380 --> 00:58:52.460]   Now I'm thinking I shouldn't have bought the hub.
[00:58:52.460 --> 00:58:55.780]   This was announced at the recode media conference.
[00:58:55.780 --> 00:59:01.460]   It'll be gone in a year.
[00:59:01.460 --> 00:59:07.340]   It's a universal control system that you plug your Apple TV Roku fire TV your cable
[00:59:07.340 --> 00:59:15.420]   box into and then you query the Kavo and it will go out and find out what device has
[00:59:15.420 --> 00:59:16.500]   that content play it.
[00:59:16.500 --> 00:59:19.380]   So and it has an Amazon Echo skills.
[00:59:19.380 --> 00:59:28.180]   So you can ask you could tell Kavo I want to watch you know unfortunate events and it
[00:59:28.180 --> 00:59:30.180]   will do it.
[00:59:30.180 --> 00:59:31.180]   You're right.
[00:59:31.180 --> 00:59:34.980]   You know what this they did demo it.
[00:59:34.980 --> 00:59:35.980]   Well we'll see.
[00:59:35.980 --> 00:59:36.980]   You know I'll tell you what.
[00:59:36.980 --> 00:59:38.540]   If you buy it tell me about it.
[00:59:38.540 --> 00:59:44.060]   Well here's what we'll do because you I'm still paying off the June oven.
[00:59:44.060 --> 00:59:48.580]   You and I have both set up the Harmony Hub see if it works and then I'll think about once
[00:59:48.580 --> 00:59:52.780]   the Kavo is available maybe getting its $400.
[00:59:52.780 --> 00:59:55.180]   I'll whittle you a nice box for your Harmony Hub.
[00:59:55.180 --> 01:00:01.740]   Yeah that's what I see a nice Harmony Hub wooden box with like aluminum.
[01:00:01.740 --> 01:00:04.860]   By the way I have to say you were absolutely right in the June oven.
[01:00:04.860 --> 01:00:06.820]   I I'm going to keep it.
[01:00:06.820 --> 01:00:08.980]   I can't live without it now.
[01:00:08.980 --> 01:00:11.540]   We can't talk about it anymore.
[01:00:11.540 --> 01:00:13.180]   Why did you give yours up?
[01:00:13.180 --> 01:00:15.620]   No I'm just people are going to get mad at us.
[01:00:15.620 --> 01:00:17.580]   I convinced Kevin to buy what it's like.
[01:00:17.580 --> 01:00:18.580]   What a beautiful one.
[01:00:18.580 --> 01:00:19.580]   Toful bought one.
[01:00:19.580 --> 01:00:20.580]   Yeah.
[01:00:20.580 --> 01:00:26.300]   Well I told you last week that I thought it was pretty good and I and now having cooked
[01:00:26.300 --> 01:00:28.420]   many more things in there it's great.
[01:00:28.420 --> 01:00:30.460]   So like what?
[01:00:30.460 --> 01:00:36.540]   Well I don't cook steak in there because like all good Texans I like my steak on the barbecue.
[01:00:36.540 --> 01:00:37.940]   Are you really a Texan?
[01:00:37.940 --> 01:00:39.860]   No.
[01:00:39.860 --> 01:00:45.700]   But I think you would agree that no one cooks steak in an oven.
[01:00:45.700 --> 01:00:47.140]   That's just crazy talk.
[01:00:47.140 --> 01:00:50.540]   Unless it's like a tornado or a bizzard out there.
[01:00:50.540 --> 01:00:52.820]   I fire up the big green egg.
[01:00:52.820 --> 01:00:57.940]   We tried it both ways and there was no question that the big green egg was the only way to
[01:00:57.940 --> 01:00:59.180]   make a steak.
[01:00:59.180 --> 01:01:00.860]   However it's great for chicken.
[01:01:00.860 --> 01:01:04.620]   I've cooked a number of chickens and it's salmon perfect.
[01:01:04.620 --> 01:01:05.700]   I haven't baked in it yet.
[01:01:05.700 --> 01:01:08.060]   I'm nervous about that.
[01:01:08.060 --> 01:01:11.780]   Not because of the oven but because I will like it and start baking more.
[01:01:11.780 --> 01:01:13.860]   Oh start with the potato.
[01:01:13.860 --> 01:01:14.860]   Yeah.
[01:01:14.860 --> 01:01:16.180]   I baked a potato.
[01:01:16.180 --> 01:01:17.100]   It was good.
[01:01:17.100 --> 01:01:20.820]   The I always microwave the potato for like you know till it's cooked and then I bake it
[01:01:20.820 --> 01:01:22.620]   to make it crispy.
[01:01:22.620 --> 01:01:24.580]   Oh that's a good idea.
[01:01:24.580 --> 01:01:25.580]   Yeah.
[01:01:25.580 --> 01:01:26.580]   It must be so much faster.
[01:01:26.580 --> 01:01:31.620]   Oh it's infinitely fast because it takes like 45 minutes to bake a potato right?
[01:01:31.620 --> 01:01:33.620]   Wow that just blew my brain.
[01:01:33.620 --> 01:01:34.620]   Okay.
[01:01:34.620 --> 01:01:35.620]   It works.
[01:01:35.620 --> 01:01:36.780]   It's not a compromise in any respect.
[01:01:36.780 --> 01:01:37.780]   It really works.
[01:01:37.780 --> 01:01:38.780]   You cook it.
[01:01:38.780 --> 01:01:39.780]   It's like 15 minutes.
[01:01:39.780 --> 01:01:40.780]   I can't remember what it is in the microwave.
[01:01:40.780 --> 01:01:44.820]   And then you put it in the ovens warmed up and you put it in the oven at crisps skin.
[01:01:44.820 --> 01:01:45.820]   Yeah.
[01:01:45.820 --> 01:01:46.820]   Yeah.
[01:01:46.820 --> 01:01:50.100]   Now does yours still offer?
[01:01:50.100 --> 01:01:54.260]   Does yours still query whether it's a strudel when you put stuff in?
[01:01:54.260 --> 01:01:55.260]   Sometimes yeah.
[01:01:55.260 --> 01:01:56.260]   Okay.
[01:01:56.260 --> 01:01:58.980]   It's not going to it's not going to learn not to ask about strudel.
[01:01:58.980 --> 01:02:03.300]   Well it wants to offer two choices I think when it's just in case one of them is more
[01:02:03.300 --> 01:02:05.060]   right than the other.
[01:02:05.060 --> 01:02:06.460]   But it does make me want strudel.
[01:02:06.460 --> 01:02:07.460]   I'm not going to lie to you.
[01:02:07.460 --> 01:02:08.460]   I'm like strudel.
[01:02:08.460 --> 01:02:09.460]   So make some.
[01:02:09.460 --> 01:02:10.460]   So watch.
[01:02:10.460 --> 01:02:12.900]   It won't know how to make strudel.
[01:02:12.900 --> 01:02:13.900]   Yes.
[01:02:13.900 --> 01:02:16.220]   Strudel is an intense thing to make.
[01:02:16.220 --> 01:02:18.060]   One important tip though.
[01:02:18.060 --> 01:02:21.220]   Prick the skin of the potato before you microwave it so it doesn't explode.
[01:02:21.220 --> 01:02:22.220]   Oh yeah.
[01:02:22.220 --> 01:02:23.220]   I whacked the fork into it.
[01:02:23.220 --> 01:02:24.620]   I whacked the fork in there.
[01:02:24.620 --> 01:02:26.140]   Yeah.
[01:02:26.140 --> 01:02:27.140]   Strudel or salmon.
[01:02:27.140 --> 01:02:29.420]   That's what my it's always seems to want to know.
[01:02:29.420 --> 01:02:34.060]   There we go.
[01:02:34.060 --> 01:02:40.980]   I think frankly this is a monetization strategy that June has a secret deal with a strudel
[01:02:40.980 --> 01:02:41.980]   company.
[01:02:41.980 --> 01:02:42.980]   Oh.
[01:02:42.980 --> 01:02:45.860]   I think they actually mean like the toaster strudels.
[01:02:45.860 --> 01:02:49.700]   I think they mean to I think they mean pop tarts but they can't use the commercial terms.
[01:02:49.700 --> 01:02:51.700]   No they pop tart is in the presets.
[01:02:51.700 --> 01:02:52.700]   It is.
[01:02:52.700 --> 01:02:53.700]   Yeah.
[01:02:53.700 --> 01:02:54.700]   All right.
[01:02:54.700 --> 01:02:55.980]   So there you go.
[01:02:55.980 --> 01:03:01.700]   Have you seen the the the the purple bird the trash to.
[01:03:01.700 --> 01:03:04.420]   Oh this this story kind of irritated me.
[01:03:04.420 --> 01:03:05.420]   I haven't seen it.
[01:03:05.420 --> 01:03:06.420]   Point to I haven't seen it either.
[01:03:06.420 --> 01:03:07.420]   I don't want to now.
[01:03:07.420 --> 01:03:09.380]   Now people are going to send it to us.
[01:03:09.380 --> 01:03:10.380]   What is it?
[01:03:10.380 --> 01:03:15.780]   It's a purple bird gift or gift depending on your point of view that is being stuck
[01:03:15.780 --> 01:03:19.300]   into Facebook comments blog comments.
[01:03:19.300 --> 01:03:22.140]   Derailing every comment.
[01:03:22.140 --> 01:03:25.980]   It comes from a Facebook sticker set called trash doves.
[01:03:25.980 --> 01:03:30.020]   I guess it went viral in Thailand.
[01:03:30.020 --> 01:03:37.740]   And now it's somehow becoming a meme on Facebook.
[01:03:37.740 --> 01:03:44.020]   So wait people put a sticker into a conversation and it derails it like because people then
[01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:45.340]   start talking about the sticker.
[01:03:45.340 --> 01:03:46.340]   I don't know.
[01:03:46.340 --> 01:03:48.180]   No they put it 80 of them.
[01:03:48.180 --> 01:03:51.140]   They put it like a ton of them to derail.
[01:03:51.140 --> 01:03:52.660]   Oh okay.
[01:03:52.660 --> 01:03:55.700]   I was like I don't could we not just ignore the sticker.
[01:03:55.700 --> 01:03:57.500]   I would ignore it.
[01:03:57.500 --> 01:03:59.460]   It's kind of.
[01:03:59.460 --> 01:04:03.460]   It looks kind of like the the Mo Williams don't let the pigeon drive the bus pigeon if
[01:04:03.460 --> 01:04:06.140]   you were on acid.
[01:04:06.140 --> 01:04:07.860]   Sorry.
[01:04:07.860 --> 01:04:12.300]   That was more revealing than you're like.
[01:04:12.300 --> 01:04:15.980]   I don't even know what Mo Williams is.
[01:04:15.980 --> 01:04:18.140]   The book don't let the pigeon drive the bus.
[01:04:18.140 --> 01:04:19.140]   Never heard that one.
[01:04:19.140 --> 01:04:23.420]   They actually did a really good profile on him in the New Yorker like two or three weeks
[01:04:23.420 --> 01:04:24.420]   ago.
[01:04:24.420 --> 01:04:25.420]   I missed it.
[01:04:25.420 --> 01:04:26.420]   I will read it.
[01:04:26.420 --> 01:04:27.420]   There you go.
[01:04:27.420 --> 01:04:30.900]   Anyway, you just don't have kids in the right age.
[01:04:30.900 --> 01:04:36.660]   Did we talk about a camera for this show or not that we talked about space X is low latency
[01:04:36.660 --> 01:04:39.740]   gigabit worldwide satellite network.
[01:04:39.740 --> 01:04:40.740]   No.
[01:04:40.740 --> 01:04:41.740]   No.
[01:04:41.740 --> 01:04:42.740]   But we should.
[01:04:42.740 --> 01:04:44.580]   Doesn't that sound cool.
[01:04:44.580 --> 01:04:51.300]   He filed a Elon filed an application Tuesday with the FCC for I would like to just do this
[01:04:51.300 --> 01:04:54.100]   for fun satellite space station authorizations.
[01:04:54.100 --> 01:04:55.300]   Yeah, I need some.
[01:04:55.300 --> 01:05:03.060]   I'm going to want I would need to can I get about 4,425 of those 4,425 satellites in low
[01:05:03.060 --> 01:05:09.940]   earth orbit ranging from 715 to 823 miles high.
[01:05:09.940 --> 01:05:13.340]   It's really low like the direct TV satellites.
[01:05:13.340 --> 01:05:16.420]   There are 22,000 miles.
[01:05:16.420 --> 01:05:19.700]   But when you have low earth orbits for internet, that means low latency, right?
[01:05:19.700 --> 01:05:22.980]   Part of the problems with satellite internet is how long it takes to get up to the satellite
[01:05:22.980 --> 01:05:26.340]   and back down from the satellite space X.
[01:05:26.340 --> 01:05:30.140]   Believe it or not, says latencies will be in the 25 to 35 millisecond range.
[01:05:30.140 --> 01:05:38.020]   That's like terrestrial internet and about a 20th of the speeds with current satellite.
[01:05:38.020 --> 01:05:39.780]   So what is new here?
[01:05:39.780 --> 01:05:41.180]   Because he has been talking about this.
[01:05:41.180 --> 01:05:43.340]   Is it new that he just filed for?
[01:05:43.340 --> 01:05:44.340]   That's what's new.
[01:05:44.340 --> 01:05:46.260]   He filed to do it.
[01:05:46.260 --> 01:05:48.180]   So he's been talking, you know, he talks.
[01:05:48.180 --> 01:05:49.180]   He's a talker.
[01:05:49.180 --> 01:05:50.180]   He talks.
[01:05:50.180 --> 01:05:51.940]   He's got hyper loop and all that stuff.
[01:05:51.940 --> 01:05:55.980]   But he's actually now filing for the he's been working out for two years.
[01:05:55.980 --> 01:06:01.140]   They got a billion in funding from Google and fidelity in January of 2015 for this for
[01:06:01.140 --> 01:06:02.140]   this.
[01:06:02.140 --> 01:06:03.780]   But a billion is not coming.
[01:06:03.780 --> 01:06:06.540]   I don't think it's even close to what it would cost.
[01:06:06.540 --> 01:06:07.540]   How many?
[01:06:07.540 --> 01:06:09.060]   What's the number total number of satellites?
[01:06:09.060 --> 01:06:10.060]   4,000.
[01:06:10.060 --> 01:06:11.060]   25.
[01:06:11.060 --> 01:06:12.860]   Now, how many per launch do you imagine?
[01:06:12.860 --> 01:06:14.060]   They're tiny though, right?
[01:06:14.060 --> 01:06:15.060]   Yeah, they're coffee.
[01:06:15.060 --> 01:06:16.060]   They're like you said.
[01:06:16.060 --> 01:06:17.060]   Yeah.
[01:06:17.060 --> 01:06:18.060]   Okay.
[01:06:18.060 --> 01:06:23.900]   And they're talking and the application mentioned 2019 is the launch.
[01:06:23.900 --> 01:06:26.140]   So this would be good for him because it gives him.
[01:06:26.140 --> 01:06:29.700]   Oh, don't just say how he launches does that take?
[01:06:29.700 --> 01:06:31.100]   That's what gives you the idea of the cost.
[01:06:31.100 --> 01:06:32.100]   Right.
[01:06:32.100 --> 01:06:35.340]   Well, I was going to say how the economy is a scale inherent in throwing those up there
[01:06:35.340 --> 01:06:40.620]   for his space for the launch business.
[01:06:40.620 --> 01:06:44.740]   Now you can launch these actually like a bunch of them at one.
[01:06:44.740 --> 01:06:45.740]   Yeah, like a merve.
[01:06:45.740 --> 01:06:46.740]   Yeah, I presume so.
[01:06:46.740 --> 01:06:47.740]   Yeah.
[01:06:47.740 --> 01:06:53.220]   Plus, I imagine are they, are they geo-synchronous or does he have to cover the entire globe because
[01:06:53.220 --> 01:06:54.220]   they move around?
[01:06:54.220 --> 01:06:57.060]   You can't launch them like a merve, John.
[01:06:57.060 --> 01:06:58.180]   They're not geo-synchronous.
[01:06:58.180 --> 01:07:02.260]   You can't because you have to place them carefully.
[01:07:02.260 --> 01:07:07.980]   But no, yeah, you could if you had guidance systems and rockets and thrusters in the coffee
[01:07:07.980 --> 01:07:08.980]   can and fuel.
[01:07:08.980 --> 01:07:10.180]   Well, you don't need much.
[01:07:10.180 --> 01:07:17.420]   It's like a little, you need a little, like a little, a little spray can, spray paint can.
[01:07:17.420 --> 01:07:20.180]   I saw that in gravity.
[01:07:20.180 --> 01:07:21.980]   Hold on.
[01:07:21.980 --> 01:07:23.620]   Oh, no.
[01:07:23.620 --> 01:07:26.060]   What was that movie where they capture the, oh, interstellar.
[01:07:26.060 --> 01:07:27.060]   They capture the guy.
[01:07:27.060 --> 01:07:29.060]   He pokes a hole in his glove.
[01:07:29.060 --> 01:07:33.380]   Like, like, was that in the Martian?
[01:07:33.380 --> 01:07:34.860]   That was the Martian where they rescue him.
[01:07:34.860 --> 01:07:35.860]   Yeah.
[01:07:35.860 --> 01:07:36.860]   He says like Iron Man.
[01:07:36.860 --> 01:07:38.700]   I could fly like Iron Man.
[01:07:38.700 --> 01:07:39.700]   Okay.
[01:07:39.700 --> 01:07:47.300]   See now, they already used like little, like little, like, can there Kansas propellants
[01:07:47.300 --> 01:07:49.380]   in space walks and stuff.
[01:07:49.380 --> 01:07:51.860]   Yeah, that's commonly used.
[01:07:51.860 --> 01:07:52.860]   You wouldn't need much.
[01:07:52.860 --> 01:07:54.980]   So let's say you get them all up to the height.
[01:07:54.980 --> 01:07:55.980]   Okay.
[01:07:55.980 --> 01:08:00.980]   There's 20 of them up there and each one has just a little bit of propellant and no, maybe
[01:08:00.980 --> 01:08:01.980]   not.
[01:08:01.980 --> 01:08:03.900]   Maybe you can't have 4000 launches.
[01:08:03.900 --> 01:08:07.620]   No, they don't, but I don't think it works that way.
[01:08:07.620 --> 01:08:11.620]   Let me.
[01:08:11.620 --> 01:08:14.460]   India just did a hundred four satellites from one rocket.
[01:08:14.460 --> 01:08:15.460]   Yeah.
[01:08:15.460 --> 01:08:16.460]   Right.
[01:08:16.460 --> 01:08:17.860]   According to the first one.
[01:08:17.860 --> 01:08:18.860]   Okay.
[01:08:18.860 --> 01:08:19.860]   All right.
[01:08:19.860 --> 01:08:20.860]   That starts too.
[01:08:20.860 --> 01:08:23.180]   But these are the, these are the tiny planet labs ones.
[01:08:23.180 --> 01:08:27.580]   So okay, this is, this is my thought is, yeah, you can do a bunch at one time.
[01:08:27.580 --> 01:08:30.100]   I'm just trying to figure out how they, how they work.
[01:08:30.100 --> 01:08:35.140]   Now, if you're really cool, he'd send up 3D printers and make them in space.
[01:08:35.140 --> 01:08:36.140]   Okay.
[01:08:36.140 --> 01:08:38.900]   No, because how would you, how would you stock your 3D printers?
[01:08:38.900 --> 01:08:41.700]   Then you've got double the space trash.
[01:08:41.700 --> 01:08:44.380]   Oh, talk about space trash.
[01:08:44.380 --> 01:08:55.060]   That's a good point.
[01:08:55.060 --> 01:08:57.900]   If you don't have a little bit of propellant.
[01:08:57.900 --> 01:09:01.540]   All right.
[01:09:01.540 --> 01:09:04.540]   This whole conversation is derailed by the fact that none of us know how these satellites
[01:09:04.540 --> 01:09:05.540]   actually work.
[01:09:05.540 --> 01:09:09.500]   How does, how do satellites get formed?
[01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:11.900]   This is where we're adding great value to the conversation.
[01:09:11.900 --> 01:09:15.060]   Yeah, this is the kind of content and commentary.
[01:09:15.060 --> 01:09:16.060]   All right.
[01:09:16.060 --> 01:09:19.340]   Moving on, moving on, moving on, moving on.
[01:09:19.340 --> 01:09:22.740]   Uh, do, do, do, do, April, if you want to get the Chromebook, should I talk about this
[01:09:22.740 --> 01:09:23.740]   Chromebook plus?
[01:09:23.740 --> 01:09:24.740]   Please.
[01:09:24.740 --> 01:09:25.740]   Yeah.
[01:09:25.740 --> 01:09:26.740]   So this is available now.
[01:09:26.740 --> 01:09:29.260]   I got it from Best Buy 450 bucks.
[01:09:29.260 --> 01:09:32.860]   The pro will be available in a couple of months, Jeff.
[01:09:32.860 --> 01:09:35.380]   You'd have to wait for a hundred bucks more.
[01:09:35.380 --> 01:09:39.060]   And I have been told time and time again, the only difference between the Sam, this
[01:09:39.060 --> 01:09:42.940]   is the one that leaked out, the Samsung Chromebook Pro that leaked out.
[01:09:42.940 --> 01:09:44.740]   Everybody was a last late last year.
[01:09:44.740 --> 01:09:47.420]   Everybody was like, Oh, I can't wait to get it.
[01:09:47.420 --> 01:09:49.060]   It finally came out.
[01:09:49.060 --> 01:09:52.700]   And to my knowledge, the only difference between the two of them, there's one difference and
[01:09:52.700 --> 01:09:56.060]   one difference only is the microprocessor.
[01:09:56.060 --> 01:09:57.060]   It's actually probably more than that.
[01:09:57.060 --> 01:10:00.140]   It's the system on a chip because it's going to include the graphics and everything.
[01:10:00.140 --> 01:10:05.740]   The difference, the, the, uh, four hundred fifty dollar plus has an arm chip.
[01:10:05.740 --> 01:10:08.140]   Probably I'm guessing they said it's an octo core.
[01:10:08.140 --> 01:10:13.300]   I'm guessing it's the Samsung Exynos arm chip that they've used in the galaxy and the
[01:10:13.300 --> 01:10:15.700]   international versions of galaxy phones.
[01:10:15.700 --> 01:10:20.660]   And then the one coming out in April will be an Intel chip, probably the M3, the mobile
[01:10:20.660 --> 01:10:23.420]   i3.
[01:10:23.420 --> 01:10:28.980]   I don't think that's going to make a whole heck of a lot of difference in performance.
[01:10:28.980 --> 01:10:34.540]   And I do think that probably the arm is going to get battery battery life, but until they
[01:10:34.540 --> 01:10:36.780]   come out, but I didn't want to wait.
[01:10:36.780 --> 01:10:38.860]   So I, and it was four fifty.
[01:10:38.860 --> 01:10:41.260]   This is what you and I, Jeff have been talking about for a long time.
[01:10:41.260 --> 01:10:42.260]   Yeah.
[01:10:42.260 --> 01:10:44.500]   There was the five hundred dollar good growth.
[01:10:44.500 --> 01:10:46.180]   The mid middle of the road one.
[01:10:46.180 --> 01:10:47.180]   Yeah.
[01:10:47.180 --> 01:10:51.580]   Not, uh, cause not a two hundred and fifty dollar really cheap, oh plastic-y thing like
[01:10:51.580 --> 01:10:55.620]   a net book and not a twelve hundred dollar Google pixel.
[01:10:55.620 --> 01:10:59.260]   The interesting thing is this is the, as far as I can tell, Google's not doing pixels
[01:10:59.260 --> 01:11:00.260]   anymore.
[01:11:00.260 --> 01:11:01.260]   Right?
[01:11:01.260 --> 01:11:06.260]   They've kind of, they discontinued the pixel to maybe we'll find out at Google I/O.
[01:11:06.260 --> 01:11:08.260]   That's coming up in May, right?
[01:11:08.260 --> 01:11:09.260]   Yep.
[01:11:09.260 --> 01:11:12.580]   But Samsung says design in conjunction with Google does that just mean they took the
[01:11:12.580 --> 01:11:16.140]   Chrome OS and put it on here or did they work with Google?
[01:11:16.140 --> 01:11:23.220]   It's a lot like a similar all aluminum Chromebooks from Dell and Asus.
[01:11:23.220 --> 01:11:24.220]   It's a convertible.
[01:11:24.220 --> 01:11:27.980]   So it's got a hinge that goes all the way around so you can use it as a tablet.
[01:11:27.980 --> 01:11:33.060]   And this makes sense because all the Chromebooks that come out this year supposedly will be,
[01:11:33.060 --> 01:11:36.500]   and this one is one of them, will support, uh, Android's Play Store.
[01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:39.340]   So I could put Android apps on here, not all apps work.
[01:11:39.340 --> 01:11:43.100]   Some apps to say, you know, not compatible if it, you know, if it's really a mobile app,
[01:11:43.100 --> 01:11:44.980]   but most of the apps work fine.
[01:11:44.980 --> 01:11:51.060]   It also makes sense to have it fold over like this because there's a stylus Samsung style
[01:11:51.060 --> 01:11:52.460]   pen.
[01:11:52.460 --> 01:11:55.980]   This is not the S Pen in the Note 5 or 7.
[01:11:55.980 --> 01:12:01.500]   This is maybe three generations ago, but it has many of the same, well, that's fine.
[01:12:01.500 --> 01:12:02.500]   It doesn't have a button on it.
[01:12:02.500 --> 01:12:04.740]   It's just a plain old pen.
[01:12:04.740 --> 01:12:06.740]   It has many of the same features.
[01:12:06.740 --> 01:12:11.700]   And in fact, there is dedicated software you can use with this, which is kind of neat.
[01:12:11.700 --> 01:12:13.620]   All I'll, what I'll do is I'll launch.
[01:12:13.620 --> 01:12:19.180]   I think I have a note taking app.
[01:12:19.180 --> 01:12:20.420]   I just downloaded here.
[01:12:20.420 --> 01:12:22.220]   What was the name of that?
[01:12:22.220 --> 01:12:23.500]   Now I have to find it.
[01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:26.780]   A lot of these are, you know, squid is called squid note.
[01:12:26.780 --> 01:12:31.460]   A lot of these are, um, this is, so.
[01:12:31.460 --> 01:12:34.180]   You can embed pictures.
[01:12:34.180 --> 01:12:35.860]   You have pen capabilities.
[01:12:35.860 --> 01:12:38.140]   I can, I can draw.
[01:12:38.140 --> 01:12:40.860]   I can also erase.
[01:12:40.860 --> 01:12:42.380]   I wish it had an eraser on the top.
[01:12:42.380 --> 01:12:44.580]   It doesn't, but, uh, oops.
[01:12:44.580 --> 01:12:47.500]   I can, oops, I'm trying to do it upside down.
[01:12:47.500 --> 01:12:50.140]   You can't do it upside down.
[01:12:50.140 --> 01:12:52.860]   You can do handwriting.
[01:12:52.860 --> 01:13:00.860]   So I can see, I totally can see people using this as kind of a, um, a school note taking
[01:13:00.860 --> 01:13:04.100]   everything when they fold it over like this, right?
[01:13:04.100 --> 01:13:07.020]   And you know, hold it like this.
[01:13:07.020 --> 01:13:11.180]   And um, by the way, you can, you can zoom and pinch and all of that.
[01:13:11.180 --> 01:13:13.780]   I'm not sure where it's not going full screen though.
[01:13:13.780 --> 01:13:14.780]   That's kind of interesting.
[01:13:14.780 --> 01:13:19.940]   I guess it's designed for landscape mode.
[01:13:19.940 --> 01:13:24.500]   And it has pretty good, in fact, excellent hand, uh, palm rejection because I'm dragging
[01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:26.540]   my hand across the screen.
[01:13:26.540 --> 01:13:33.860]   Oh, I mean, that's, that's pretty good, right?
[01:13:33.860 --> 01:13:36.900]   Um, you can make this bigger or smaller, which is kind of cool.
[01:13:36.900 --> 01:13:37.900]   It's an infinite software.
[01:13:37.900 --> 01:13:39.260]   Is that just a, I'm sorry.
[01:13:39.260 --> 01:13:40.820]   No, this is called squid note.
[01:13:40.820 --> 01:13:44.860]   It's free, but there's, uh, in app, some in app purchases for synchronization and stuff.
[01:13:44.860 --> 01:13:45.860]   And so what's it?
[01:13:45.860 --> 01:13:46.860]   Is it, is it an Android app?
[01:13:46.860 --> 01:13:47.860]   Uh, yeah.
[01:13:47.860 --> 01:13:48.860]   No, yeah.
[01:13:48.860 --> 01:13:49.860]   No, I don't know.
[01:13:49.860 --> 01:13:50.860]   Actually, you know what?
[01:13:50.860 --> 01:13:51.860]   Grow map brand.
[01:13:51.860 --> 01:13:52.860]   That's a really good question.
[01:13:52.860 --> 01:13:53.860]   I don't know.
[01:13:53.860 --> 01:13:54.860]   It becomes hard to tell.
[01:13:54.860 --> 01:13:56.220]   Yeah, it does become hard to tell.
[01:13:56.220 --> 01:14:03.300]   And I, I, I just, the way I found it is when I looked at the stylist menu, it said, uh,
[01:14:03.300 --> 01:14:04.700]   find more stylist applications.
[01:14:04.700 --> 01:14:07.900]   Let me see what pull comes up.
[01:14:07.900 --> 01:14:08.900]   The play store.
[01:14:08.900 --> 01:14:09.900]   Okay.
[01:14:09.900 --> 01:14:11.100]   So that is a Android app.
[01:14:11.100 --> 01:14:12.620]   These are sketchbook is another one.
[01:14:12.620 --> 01:14:16.340]   That's the auto desk, a sketchbook program you could draw with this.
[01:14:16.340 --> 01:14:21.100]   Uh, so this is much like an Android tablet, you know, like your Pixel C, but it's also
[01:14:21.100 --> 01:14:23.100]   a Chromebook.
[01:14:23.100 --> 01:14:26.180]   And I have to say for the price, it's kind of what we wanted.
[01:14:26.180 --> 01:14:30.820]   Uh, now your spoil a little bit, because your Pixel has eight or 16 gigs of RAM.
[01:14:30.820 --> 01:14:31.820]   This does not.
[01:14:31.820 --> 01:14:33.620]   It only has four gigs of RAM.
[01:14:33.620 --> 01:14:36.020]   Um, it's, uh, not as fast a processor.
[01:14:36.020 --> 01:14:37.460]   You have an i5 on your Pixel.
[01:14:37.460 --> 01:14:38.460]   This is not an i5.
[01:14:38.460 --> 01:14:40.460]   At best, it's an M3.
[01:14:40.460 --> 01:14:43.300]   Um, I, the keyboard is almost identical to the Pixel.
[01:14:43.300 --> 01:14:44.700]   In fact, it doesn't kind of look.
[01:14:44.700 --> 01:14:45.700]   It does.
[01:14:45.700 --> 01:14:46.700]   Yeah.
[01:14:46.700 --> 01:14:47.700]   I was looking at one right there.
[01:14:47.700 --> 01:14:50.700]   The track pad is, I'm spoiled by Apple's nice glass track pads.
[01:14:50.700 --> 01:14:52.020]   It's not as good as that.
[01:14:52.020 --> 01:14:56.180]   But it's doable and it's because you have touch and a stylus, you're not going to rely
[01:14:56.180 --> 01:14:58.180]   100% of the track pad.
[01:14:58.180 --> 01:14:59.780]   It feels very solid.
[01:14:59.780 --> 01:15:02.540]   2.3 pounds, three, two way, three eight pounds.
[01:15:02.540 --> 01:15:07.180]   It's a 12, uh, and three quarters inch screen.
[01:15:07.180 --> 01:15:10.500]   Very high dots per inch is, I think the screen is stunning.
[01:15:10.500 --> 01:15:15.580]   So to be a favorite, look up the Asus Chromebook Flip C302 C.
[01:15:15.580 --> 01:15:17.300]   It's very similar to who got that.
[01:15:17.300 --> 01:15:19.300]   Somebody just bought that that we know.
[01:15:19.300 --> 01:15:20.600]   That's 500 bucks.
[01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:25.560]   I think the, I think the Asus, the Dell and this are very similar.
[01:15:25.560 --> 01:15:26.960]   Does it have a pen though?
[01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:27.960]   Uh, no.
[01:15:27.960 --> 01:15:31.320]   The pen is what I think, uh, does that have 32 gigs or?
[01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:32.320]   Yeah.
[01:15:32.320 --> 01:15:35.940]   And it's EMMC, 32 gigs of EMMC, which is very fast.
[01:15:35.940 --> 01:15:37.900]   DDR3 Ram, which is very fast.
[01:15:37.900 --> 01:15:39.860]   This one can come with 64.
[01:15:39.860 --> 01:15:44.160]   Uh, this, oh, and I meant to do this, and I forgot I'll have to do it tomorrow.
[01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:47.400]   Uh, has a micro SD card slot.
[01:15:47.400 --> 01:15:55.540]   Now when we put SD cards in our pixels, it's treated like, um, a USB drive.
[01:15:55.540 --> 01:15:59.360]   And if you turn off the pixel, it says, oh, you didn't inject it and you have to mount
[01:15:59.360 --> 01:16:00.360]   it each time.
[01:16:00.360 --> 01:16:05.220]   It's not seen as, as internal storage, seen as X, you know, kind of weird external storage.
[01:16:05.220 --> 01:16:06.220]   But this, I don't know.
[01:16:06.220 --> 01:16:08.680]   So this has an S micro SD slot.
[01:16:08.680 --> 01:16:11.380]   So you could put another 256 gigs of storage in there.
[01:16:11.380 --> 01:16:13.480]   But my question is, is it going to be treated?
[01:16:13.480 --> 01:16:15.520]   Uh, how is it going to be treated?
[01:16:15.520 --> 01:16:19.080]   Is it going to be first class peer or is it going to look like, you know, some, you're
[01:16:19.080 --> 01:16:21.120]   probably not going to be able to put your Netflix and stuff on it.
[01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:23.800]   Cause it doesn't like to be on external storage, I don't think.
[01:16:23.800 --> 01:16:24.800]   Well, let's see.
[01:16:24.800 --> 01:16:30.360]   I'll have to see two USB C ports, just like the pixel one on each side.
[01:16:30.360 --> 01:16:33.280]   Uh, an on off switch, a volume rocker.
[01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:38.140]   The two, the only two hardware negatives I've found the speakers are small and they're
[01:16:38.140 --> 01:16:39.840]   downward firing there on the bottom.
[01:16:39.840 --> 01:16:42.960]   So you, on your lap, it might say a little muffled on the desk.
[01:16:42.960 --> 01:16:43.960]   It's fine.
[01:16:43.960 --> 01:16:44.960]   Cause it's raised slightly.
[01:16:44.960 --> 01:16:51.360]   Uh, the track has not, it's what you'd expect in a $500 computer, I guess, you know, I,
[01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:53.360]   but the screen blows me away.
[01:16:53.360 --> 01:16:57.120]   This is as good as screen on any of the, what's the, what's the res on that screen?
[01:16:57.120 --> 01:17:01.400]   Oh, what it was, I think I want to say 2500 by 1800, something like that.
[01:17:01.400 --> 01:17:02.400]   Wow.
[01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:03.400]   It could be aces is 1920 by 1080.
[01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:04.960]   It was higher resolution than that.
[01:17:04.960 --> 01:17:05.960]   Yeah.
[01:17:05.960 --> 01:17:09.040]   Here I'll look up the, uh, resolution for you.
[01:17:09.040 --> 01:17:10.480]   And the Dell has a new one.
[01:17:10.480 --> 01:17:13.960]   Dell also has a $500 aluminum body.
[01:17:13.960 --> 01:17:18.040]   This seems to be the next, but this is exactly what for two years we've been saying, we don't
[01:17:18.040 --> 01:17:25.520]   want to pay 1200 bucks for a pixel, but we want something better than the $250 HP cheapy.
[01:17:25.520 --> 01:17:27.320]   Um, I like this.
[01:17:27.320 --> 01:17:30.160]   I would say this is the best Chromebook I've played with.
[01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:36.680]   I, I am going to have to order the, uh, this, the Dell and the, uh, a suits just to compare.
[01:17:36.680 --> 01:17:37.680]   Oh, Dell.
[01:17:37.680 --> 01:17:39.880]   I, so I searched for Dell Chromebook.
[01:17:39.880 --> 01:17:43.760]   I, I follow the link, which is Dell's link and I end up at business laptops in no Chrome.
[01:17:43.760 --> 01:17:44.760]   Uh, Dell.
[01:17:44.760 --> 01:17:45.760]   Okay.
[01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:49.040]   Guys, I learned all about satellites.
[01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:50.040]   If you want to go back to me.
[01:17:50.040 --> 01:17:51.040]   Oh, good.
[01:17:51.040 --> 01:17:52.040]   We will.
[01:17:52.040 --> 01:17:53.040]   Okay.
[01:17:53.040 --> 01:17:54.040]   I was afraid you were bored.
[01:17:54.040 --> 01:17:56.400]   That's so it, I'm like, I'm like Chromebooks.
[01:17:56.400 --> 01:17:57.640]   It's half an inch thick.
[01:17:57.640 --> 01:18:00.680]   It's very thin, 2.38 pounds.
[01:18:00.680 --> 01:18:02.960]   The display is 2400 by 1600.
[01:18:02.960 --> 01:18:07.280]   Sorry, I got the numbers wrong, but that's, that's actually higher dots per inch than
[01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:08.280]   the pixel.
[01:18:08.280 --> 01:18:10.840]   It's 234 pixels per inch.
[01:18:10.840 --> 01:18:11.840]   It's bright.
[01:18:11.840 --> 01:18:14.040]   3-2, which, but so is the pixel.
[01:18:14.040 --> 01:18:15.560]   So is the Microsoft Surface.
[01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:18.000]   That seems to be, it is LED.
[01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:21.200]   It feels like an OLED, but it's LED.
[01:18:21.200 --> 01:18:24.680]   The processor is sorry, not an octa core.
[01:18:24.680 --> 01:18:29.800]   It's a hexa core arm based processor running at two gigahertz.
[01:18:29.800 --> 01:18:35.240]   So now that I got the actual specs, I, I, but I, this, I could see a college kid using
[01:18:35.240 --> 01:18:37.720]   this for a laptop, certainly a high school kid.
[01:18:37.720 --> 01:18:39.240]   Um, I really like this.
[01:18:39.240 --> 01:18:41.520]   I traveled now with the pixel C.
[01:18:41.520 --> 01:18:44.240]   It's like I used the pixel at home and in the office.
[01:18:44.240 --> 01:18:46.840]   It's only a little bigger than the pixel C, a little heavier.
[01:18:46.840 --> 01:18:50.720]   Oh, it's heavier than the pixel, I mean, I'll bet the pixel C right with keyboard.
[01:18:50.720 --> 01:18:55.400]   It's staff, it's in between the pixel C and the, and the Chromebook pixel.
[01:18:55.400 --> 01:18:58.440]   I think it's, I'm thrilled, frankly.
[01:18:58.440 --> 01:18:59.440]   Wow.
[01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:01.400]   I feel like they are now, we now have a choice.
[01:19:01.400 --> 01:19:02.840]   They're available best by now.
[01:19:02.840 --> 01:19:05.400]   These are available for 450 bucks at Best Buy.
[01:19:05.400 --> 01:19:10.440]   Um, and I don't, I don't, you know, I, I may be wrong when we find that when they come
[01:19:10.440 --> 01:19:16.560]   April and we try these M three based Chromebook pros, but I think that there's no reason why
[01:19:16.560 --> 01:19:21.840]   a six core X and O's would be much slower.
[01:19:21.840 --> 01:19:25.800]   Four gigs of RAM, you like more RAM because you have lots of tabs open.
[01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:28.160]   Only 32 gigs of storage, fast storage, EMO's.
[01:19:28.160 --> 01:19:32.760]   Plus you're going to be doing things like photo manipulation using Android now.
[01:19:32.760 --> 01:19:35.120]   You're going to want more RAM.
[01:19:35.120 --> 01:19:39.240]   I think it's mistaken not to give it eight, eight bags.
[01:19:39.240 --> 01:19:40.240]   Okay.
[01:19:40.240 --> 01:19:41.240]   Possibly.
[01:19:41.240 --> 01:19:42.240]   Yeah.
[01:19:42.240 --> 01:19:46.560]   I mean, you can use polar with two R's, P O L A R R, which is kind of like light room as
[01:19:46.560 --> 01:19:47.560]   a Chrome extension.
[01:19:47.560 --> 01:19:53.920]   Uh, snap, and you can use Android snap seed or light room itself or light room mix, Photoshop
[01:19:53.920 --> 01:19:55.920]   mix.
[01:19:55.920 --> 01:19:59.600]   Um, anyway, quick review of that.
[01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:01.680]   Now let's hear about rocket ships.
[01:20:01.680 --> 01:20:03.320]   Okay.
[01:20:03.320 --> 01:20:07.080]   Can they launch a hundred satellites in one go?
[01:20:07.080 --> 01:20:08.080]   Okay.
[01:20:08.080 --> 01:20:09.480]   So a couple of things.
[01:20:09.480 --> 01:20:15.600]   First, Elon is applying to launch six or sorry, 1000 of the first 1000.
[01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:17.480]   Oh, he only doesn't want to learn at all.
[01:20:17.480 --> 01:20:21.960]   Well, he just, I, there's constraints about money and time and approvals.
[01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:26.920]   So what he's going to do is cover a certain area where the US is.
[01:20:26.920 --> 01:20:27.920]   Sure.
[01:20:27.920 --> 01:20:28.920]   So yeah.
[01:20:28.920 --> 01:20:31.000]   So parts of Alaska won't be there without the FCC as approval.
[01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:34.760]   So, but the satellites he's launching are actually really big.
[01:20:34.760 --> 01:20:36.000]   Um, they are.
[01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:37.000]   Really?
[01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:38.000]   And yeah, relatively.
[01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:39.000]   Okay.
[01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:40.720]   So I got some cops for you.
[01:20:40.720 --> 01:20:44.520]   I just have to open all my, all my tabs, my mini, mini tabs.
[01:20:44.520 --> 01:20:45.520]   Okay.
[01:20:45.520 --> 01:20:48.320]   So his, his, how do you do this on the fly?
[01:20:48.320 --> 01:20:52.360]   You're, it's really, it's fun to watch a real journalist.
[01:20:52.360 --> 01:20:56.360]   They're going to weigh 850 pounds and measure 13 by six by four feet.
[01:20:56.360 --> 01:20:57.840]   So coffee can.
[01:20:57.840 --> 01:20:58.840]   Whoa.
[01:20:58.840 --> 01:20:59.880]   That is not one of the coffee cans.
[01:20:59.880 --> 01:21:05.720]   So now India, which is what Karsten threw up, they threw up on the, on the screen.
[01:21:05.720 --> 01:21:09.480]   They are the cute, their planet labs doves was the type of.
[01:21:09.480 --> 01:21:10.480]   That's the little ones.
[01:21:10.480 --> 01:21:11.480]   Yeah.
[01:21:11.480 --> 01:21:12.840]   Those are less than 10 kilograms.
[01:21:12.840 --> 01:21:16.880]   And what they did is they shot it up the rocket and they timed it.
[01:21:16.880 --> 01:21:22.280]   So it released a little spurts of satellites during the orbit.
[01:21:22.280 --> 01:21:30.840]   Um, and to give you a little bit more perspective, the GPS satellites are must open this tab.
[01:21:30.840 --> 01:21:34.280]   They weigh about two tons.
[01:21:34.280 --> 01:21:36.080]   So very different.
[01:21:36.080 --> 01:21:39.440]   So this is kind of a mid, mid satellite thing.
[01:21:39.440 --> 01:21:44.280]   And if you want, I pulled up the cost per ton of different space X has the cheapest cost
[01:21:44.280 --> 01:21:47.080]   per ton for throwing up these satellites.
[01:21:47.080 --> 01:21:51.640]   So this would be great for them, especially if the Trump administration decides they hate
[01:21:51.640 --> 01:21:54.400]   Elon and don't want to launch any more US satellites with them.
[01:21:54.400 --> 01:21:56.720]   I think Elon's got an in in the White House.
[01:21:56.720 --> 01:21:59.280]   I think he's going to get whatever he wants.
[01:21:59.280 --> 01:22:00.440]   All right.
[01:22:00.440 --> 01:22:02.440]   So that's all I know about satellites now.
[01:22:02.440 --> 01:22:04.240]   But that's more, that's more than what we're going to do.
[01:22:04.240 --> 01:22:07.480]   We stand corrected a lot more.
[01:22:07.480 --> 01:22:09.000]   Fixed it all up.
[01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:10.000]   All right.
[01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:15.160]   Anybody seduced by the, the new Verizon, you're a Verizon customer.
[01:22:15.160 --> 01:22:17.160]   Jeff still, right?
[01:22:17.160 --> 01:22:18.160]   I love which phone.
[01:22:18.160 --> 01:22:20.120]   No, no, you give up.
[01:22:20.120 --> 01:22:22.040]   So does it really mean unlimited?
[01:22:22.040 --> 01:22:23.040]   Unlimited?
[01:22:23.040 --> 01:22:28.240]   They, they gated at, I think it's 22 or 28.
[01:22:28.240 --> 01:22:32.560]   Team bubbles is throttled at 28 gigabytes.
[01:22:32.560 --> 01:22:34.000]   I'm not gigabytes.
[01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:35.000]   Yeah, gigabytes.
[01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:36.000]   Yeah.
[01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:41.800]   And I think Verizon's 22 gigabytes, Sprint is 23 gigabytes.
[01:22:41.800 --> 01:22:44.520]   Verizon doesn't down sample video though.
[01:22:44.520 --> 01:22:50.480]   It lets you see the video at its full HD resolution.
[01:22:50.480 --> 01:22:54.400]   Team Mobile then responded by saying, okay, we'll do the same thing.
[01:22:54.400 --> 01:23:02.040]   And both have added, I think 10 gigabytes of hot spotting per month.
[01:23:02.040 --> 01:23:03.240]   So I love the competition.
[01:23:03.240 --> 01:23:08.080]   I mean, team mobile responded the next day saying, okay, we can do that.
[01:23:08.080 --> 01:23:09.560]   But it's not really a limited.
[01:23:09.560 --> 01:23:14.680]   Well, so I think what Verizon said is you can get 22 gigabytes of data at guaranteed
[01:23:14.680 --> 01:23:17.160]   full 4G LTE speeds.
[01:23:17.160 --> 01:23:18.160]   Yeah.
[01:23:18.160 --> 01:23:21.440]   And then it, but it does say, so here's what it does say.
[01:23:21.440 --> 01:23:23.760]   Oh, video.
[01:23:23.760 --> 01:23:28.080]   Verizon says it may quote prioritize usage behind other customers and the event of network
[01:23:28.080 --> 01:23:29.080]   congestion.
[01:23:29.080 --> 01:23:30.080]   Right.
[01:23:30.080 --> 01:23:31.080]   Right.
[01:23:31.080 --> 01:23:34.080]   So I'm in the middle of nowhere.
[01:23:34.080 --> 01:23:35.080]   Yay.
[01:23:35.080 --> 01:23:36.080]   I'm sticking with team mobile.
[01:23:36.080 --> 01:23:37.080]   Did you move to team mobile?
[01:23:37.080 --> 01:23:38.520]   Jeff, no, or you went to Google Fi?
[01:23:38.520 --> 01:23:39.520]   No, I would.
[01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:40.520]   Well, no, no, no.
[01:23:40.520 --> 01:23:42.720]   My main phone is still AT&T because I'm grandfather with unlimited.
[01:23:42.720 --> 01:23:43.720]   That's right.
[01:23:43.720 --> 01:23:45.280]   Which they were just raised five bucks a month.
[01:23:45.280 --> 01:23:48.880]   Well, the good news is I think all these guys are now really competing strongly against
[01:23:48.880 --> 01:23:54.760]   one another and all four of the main carriers in the US, T mobile, Sprint, you, uh, uh, uh,
[01:23:54.760 --> 01:23:57.920]   Verizon and ATT offer unlimited plans now.
[01:23:57.920 --> 01:23:59.720]   But you can't tether with the unlimited.
[01:23:59.720 --> 01:24:02.080]   You can only tether up to 10 gigabytes.
[01:24:02.080 --> 01:24:03.080]   Right.
[01:24:03.080 --> 01:24:05.520]   That's that's tethering your heart spot.
[01:24:05.520 --> 01:24:06.520]   AT&T.
[01:24:06.520 --> 01:24:07.520]   I can't tether at all.
[01:24:07.520 --> 01:24:08.520]   That's why I hear the microphone.
[01:24:08.520 --> 01:24:10.200]   I think now, you know, I saw a comparison.
[01:24:10.200 --> 01:24:12.080]   I think everybody's going to let well, let's see.
[01:24:12.080 --> 01:24:13.320]   I don't know.
[01:24:13.320 --> 01:24:17.240]   Like grandfather, they, he and he allows no tethering.
[01:24:17.240 --> 01:24:18.240]   Yeah.
[01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:19.960]   And I can't get around it without paying extra, right?
[01:24:19.960 --> 01:24:20.960]   Or no, you can't do it.
[01:24:20.960 --> 01:24:21.960]   No, no, that's the point.
[01:24:21.960 --> 01:24:22.960]   That's the point.
[01:24:22.960 --> 01:24:26.040]   You want tethering, fellow, you're giving up your unlimited.
[01:24:26.040 --> 01:24:27.040]   Mm.
[01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:32.840]   So it's a, it's posted a comparison of all three.
[01:24:32.840 --> 01:24:39.560]   Let me turn their auto play off data limits and throttling.
[01:24:39.560 --> 01:24:44.280]   AT&T 22, Sprint 23, T mobile 28, Verizon 22.
[01:24:44.280 --> 01:24:50.160]   At that point, you, you get slowed down a little bit cost per single line.
[01:24:50.160 --> 01:24:53.600]   You know, you've seen all of these, uh, and they're all close.
[01:24:53.600 --> 01:24:55.240]   They're really close.
[01:24:55.240 --> 01:25:02.960]   Traditional lines, uh, AT&T charges you additionally for HD video streaming a hundred bucks a
[01:25:02.960 --> 01:25:03.960]   month.
[01:25:03.960 --> 01:25:05.800]   Uh, wow.
[01:25:05.800 --> 01:25:09.240]   Uh, mobile hotspot.
[01:25:09.240 --> 01:25:10.960]   Yep.
[01:25:10.960 --> 01:25:12.720]   Only in a smart car.
[01:25:12.720 --> 01:25:16.600]   Wow, Jeff, only in a smart car.
[01:25:16.600 --> 01:25:17.840]   Can you tether?
[01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:18.840]   That's ridiculous.
[01:25:18.840 --> 01:25:21.880]   That is only in a clown car.
[01:25:21.880 --> 01:25:27.080]   It's in 10 gigabytes of hotspot data, T mobile, 10 gigabytes of hotspot data, Sprint five.
[01:25:27.080 --> 01:25:28.720]   Well, this is where a file speeds it.
[01:25:28.720 --> 01:25:29.800]   You can tether as much as you want.
[01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:31.800]   You just pay 10 bucks per gigabyte.
[01:25:31.800 --> 01:25:32.800]   You go five.
[01:25:32.800 --> 01:25:33.800]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:25:33.800 --> 01:25:34.800]   Beautiful.
[01:25:34.800 --> 01:25:37.760]   It's 10 bucks, 10 bucks per gigabyte for whatever you want to use it.
[01:25:37.760 --> 01:25:43.720]   CNET's conclusion was T mobile is probably the one to stick with if all other things
[01:25:43.720 --> 01:25:44.720]   being equal.
[01:25:44.720 --> 01:25:48.520]   You know, you obviously have to consider, um, connectivity in your area.
[01:25:48.520 --> 01:25:49.520]   I like to.
[01:25:49.520 --> 01:25:53.400]   I like to do a T mobile Lisa though, as soon as Verizon announced this said, I'm going
[01:25:53.400 --> 01:25:54.400]   back.
[01:25:54.400 --> 01:25:55.400]   She switched off.
[01:25:55.400 --> 01:25:56.400]   I could visit a switched off.
[01:25:56.400 --> 01:25:57.400]   She's never been happy.
[01:25:57.400 --> 01:25:59.800]   She likes her Verizon.
[01:25:59.800 --> 01:26:01.120]   She also wanted diamonds.
[01:26:01.120 --> 01:26:02.120]   So I get it.
[01:26:02.120 --> 01:26:03.120]   Yep.
[01:26:03.120 --> 01:26:04.120]   She's a diamond girl.
[01:26:04.120 --> 01:26:05.120]   Mm hmm.
[01:26:05.120 --> 01:26:09.120]   Diamonds are a girl's best friend.
[01:26:09.120 --> 01:26:14.200]   Uh, I think we can, let's take a break and we can come back and get your, uh, picks
[01:26:14.200 --> 01:26:15.200]   a good idea.
[01:26:15.200 --> 01:26:16.200]   Yeah.
[01:26:16.200 --> 01:26:18.280]   I kind of already did mine, but I'll find something else.

[01:28:33.240 --> 01:28:38.800]   We thank them so much for their support of this week in Google.
[01:28:38.800 --> 01:28:44.080]   By the way, on Verizon, on iOS, I can get 750/750.
[01:28:44.080 --> 01:28:45.080]   750.
[01:28:45.080 --> 01:28:48.080]   750 down by wire.
[01:28:48.080 --> 01:28:49.080]   Megabit.
[01:28:49.080 --> 01:28:50.080]   Megabit.
[01:28:50.080 --> 01:28:52.720]   So you can't even get up to gig.
[01:28:52.720 --> 01:28:53.720]   Not a gig.
[01:28:53.720 --> 01:28:54.720]   750.
[01:28:54.720 --> 01:28:55.720]   750.
[01:28:55.720 --> 01:28:56.720]   I now want 50/50.
[01:28:56.720 --> 01:28:57.720]   It's what?
[01:28:57.720 --> 01:28:59.720]   I think that's plenty.
[01:28:59.720 --> 01:29:00.720]   Oh, God, yeah.
[01:29:00.720 --> 01:29:01.720]   The question is I'm at 50/50.
[01:29:01.720 --> 01:29:04.320]   You don't even know if you're happy with 50.
[01:29:04.320 --> 01:29:06.320]   No reason to go to a hundred.
[01:29:06.320 --> 01:29:07.320]   You're planned.
[01:29:07.320 --> 01:29:09.320]   You're planned.
[01:29:09.320 --> 01:29:10.560]   Jake's in school.
[01:29:10.560 --> 01:29:13.000]   He's not using, you know, he's not running those bit torrents.
[01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:17.000]   You don't think you're all right?
[01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:24.920]   We get from Comcast, like 250 down on the consumer and a hundred down on the business
[01:29:24.920 --> 01:29:27.760]   class, but the business class is symmetric.
[01:29:27.760 --> 01:29:29.400]   Or no, it's not symmetric.
[01:29:29.400 --> 01:29:30.400]   Neither is symmetric.
[01:29:30.400 --> 01:29:31.400]   It's not?
[01:29:31.400 --> 01:29:34.880]   No, it's a hundred down and about 15 up.
[01:29:34.880 --> 01:29:36.800]   Comcast is terrible.
[01:29:36.800 --> 01:29:39.840]   But it's kind of there's a, there's, I think there's a service level agreement.
[01:29:39.840 --> 01:29:40.840]   It's more consistent.
[01:29:40.840 --> 01:29:41.840]   I don't know.
[01:29:41.840 --> 01:29:45.080]   It's cheaper to get more bandwidth for some reason.
[01:29:45.080 --> 01:29:47.920]   Wait, we didn't talk about Amazon Chime.
[01:29:47.920 --> 01:29:48.920]   And that's me.
[01:29:48.920 --> 01:29:49.920]   Oh, we were going to do that.
[01:29:49.920 --> 01:29:50.920]   Yes.
[01:29:50.920 --> 01:29:52.960]   So Amazon has this, we talked about on Windows Weekly.
[01:29:52.960 --> 01:29:58.160]   That's why I forgot Amazon has decided to compete with WebEx and go to meeting with their
[01:29:58.160 --> 01:30:03.160]   own meeting service and video service Chime.
[01:30:03.160 --> 01:30:05.440]   Ding dong.
[01:30:05.440 --> 01:30:08.320]   It's worth the rest, perhaps.
[01:30:08.320 --> 01:30:12.240]   We never used GoToMeeting because it was really meeting focused.
[01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:15.760]   And Chime sounds like it is as well.
[01:30:15.760 --> 01:30:18.200]   But I'm certainly willing to try it.
[01:30:18.200 --> 01:30:21.560]   I like it because it sounds like it's one click.
[01:30:21.560 --> 01:30:26.280]   And can I just tell you all of the tech we have today and we still can't make a conference
[01:30:26.280 --> 01:30:30.080]   call like that I can join by saying yes.
[01:30:30.080 --> 01:30:33.640]   So I'm really excited to try this out.
[01:30:33.640 --> 01:30:34.640]   And there's a lot of respect.
[01:30:34.640 --> 01:30:35.640]   Oh, go ahead.
[01:30:35.640 --> 01:30:36.640]   Meetings will call you.
[01:30:36.640 --> 01:30:41.240]   It's time they'll call you and you can tap.
[01:30:41.240 --> 01:30:43.680]   So no more pins.
[01:30:43.680 --> 01:30:46.720]   iOS, Android, Windows and Mac.
[01:30:46.720 --> 01:30:48.600]   It's got chat.
[01:30:48.600 --> 01:30:52.440]   You're billed per user per month.
[01:30:52.440 --> 01:30:54.280]   There's three additions.
[01:30:54.280 --> 01:30:58.080]   Chime Basic allows you to make one to one voice and video calls and use chat and chat
[01:30:58.080 --> 01:31:05.600]   terms and all your devices.
[01:31:05.600 --> 01:31:12.600]   Chime Plus adds screen sharing and your company directory.
[01:31:12.600 --> 01:31:19.040]   Chime Pro scheduling hosting meetings, recording meetings, personalized meeting URLs up to 100
[01:31:19.040 --> 01:31:20.040]   people, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:31:20.040 --> 01:31:21.040]   I wonder how much the basic is.
[01:31:21.040 --> 01:31:22.040]   We could just use that.
[01:31:22.040 --> 01:31:23.040]   Yeah, for this.
[01:31:23.040 --> 01:31:24.040]   I'm willing to try it.
[01:31:24.040 --> 01:31:25.040]   We're looking for a replacement for Skype.
[01:31:25.040 --> 01:31:27.040]   Why do you think this is a big story?
[01:31:27.040 --> 01:31:28.040]   We've got a Chrome book.
[01:31:28.040 --> 01:31:29.040]   So I think it's --
[01:31:29.040 --> 01:31:30.040]   Does it?
[01:31:30.040 --> 01:31:31.040]   I think it does.
[01:31:31.040 --> 01:31:35.240]   It's interesting because it pulls in Amazon's infrastructure.
[01:31:35.240 --> 01:31:36.640]   So can they offer this cheaper?
[01:31:36.640 --> 01:31:43.240]   But two, could you have -- now that they're getting into voice plays, that puts them -- I
[01:31:43.240 --> 01:31:45.960]   don't know if they're using bandwidth.com for the back end.
[01:31:45.960 --> 01:31:47.440]   It says they're working with level three.
[01:31:47.440 --> 01:31:54.120]   So maybe that's their back end provider on the IP telecom services side.
[01:31:54.120 --> 01:31:59.840]   But when you have that, you could do a call from your Amazon Echo, for example.
[01:31:59.840 --> 01:32:02.840]   Not today, but wouldn't that be cool?
[01:32:02.840 --> 01:32:06.480]   And so that's where I think this could get interesting.
[01:32:06.480 --> 01:32:07.480]   Yeah.
[01:32:07.480 --> 01:32:12.000]   You're like, no, Stacey, that's weird.
[01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:13.000]   Yeah.
[01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:19.320]   Also, I just really hate dialing into conference calls, and I do it all day long.
[01:32:19.320 --> 01:32:26.120]   I'm trying to think -- I think this is -- one of the first times Amazon has used AWS with
[01:32:26.120 --> 01:32:31.720]   a front-facing consumer-facing product.
[01:32:31.720 --> 01:32:34.680]   Unless -- well, I don't know if Amazon Video is.
[01:32:34.680 --> 01:32:35.680]   Yeah.
[01:32:35.680 --> 01:32:36.680]   Yeah.
[01:32:36.680 --> 01:32:38.920]   So Echo is -- I don't know what their video platform's on.
[01:32:38.920 --> 01:32:39.920]   But yeah, no, this is --
[01:32:39.920 --> 01:32:42.440]   But it does use AWS infrastructure.
[01:32:42.440 --> 01:32:47.520]   We should mention AWS Amazon Web Services, one of our sponsors on our -- oh, Shaz.
[01:32:47.520 --> 01:32:48.520]   Yeah.
[01:32:48.520 --> 01:32:49.520]   I've never seen them.
[01:32:49.520 --> 01:32:50.760]   I'm sad about that.
[01:32:50.760 --> 01:32:55.240]   Well -- I should watch more of -- I should watch other shows.
[01:32:55.240 --> 01:32:56.960]   We just had that on Windows Weekly.
[01:32:56.960 --> 01:32:59.760]   I think they're pretty new.
[01:32:59.760 --> 01:33:01.080]   And they've been on Windows Weekly.
[01:33:01.080 --> 01:33:04.480]   Not all advertisers appear on all shows.
[01:33:04.480 --> 01:33:08.640]   Some objects may appear smaller than they are.
[01:33:08.640 --> 01:33:11.720]   Yeah, I'm hurt every advertiser who doesn't appear on this show.
[01:33:11.720 --> 01:33:12.720]   Yeah.
[01:33:12.720 --> 01:33:13.720]   Yeah, this is the best show.
[01:33:13.720 --> 01:33:15.720]   Close cover before striking.
[01:33:15.720 --> 01:33:20.920]   Batteries not included member FDIC.
[01:33:20.920 --> 01:33:25.280]   I actually wanted to mention -- and I don't know if I have it on the rundown -- the great
[01:33:25.280 --> 01:33:26.280]   rebundling.
[01:33:26.280 --> 01:33:29.840]   Did you read that piece?
[01:33:29.840 --> 01:33:32.840]   For a while, we were unbundling.
[01:33:32.840 --> 01:33:41.080]   You know, and in music, for instance, Apple had forced the record industries to get -- to
[01:33:41.080 --> 01:33:44.480]   kind of go to the 99-cent single.
[01:33:44.480 --> 01:33:49.640]   Now all of a sudden, we're bundled again because we're buying -- we're not buying individual
[01:33:49.640 --> 01:33:50.640]   records.
[01:33:50.640 --> 01:33:52.080]   We're buying Spotify or Apple Music.
[01:33:52.080 --> 01:33:54.280]   We're buying a stream.
[01:33:54.280 --> 01:33:58.480]   This is Ben Thompson in the Stratecary.
[01:33:58.480 --> 01:34:03.960]   He's talking about the great rebundling.
[01:34:03.960 --> 01:34:06.240]   Same things happening you were talking about earlier.
[01:34:06.240 --> 01:34:09.600]   You're -- in effect, rebundling.
[01:34:09.600 --> 01:34:12.240]   For a while, the promise was you just buy a TV show, right?
[01:34:12.240 --> 01:34:13.240]   But no.
[01:34:13.240 --> 01:34:19.640]   Now these services in order to get the TV show.
[01:34:19.640 --> 01:34:26.560]   We all wanted a la carte in TV and music.
[01:34:26.560 --> 01:34:38.360]   But instead, this is another view from Jeremy Phillips in DealBook in The New York Times.
[01:34:38.360 --> 01:34:42.360]   A la carte is usually more expensive.
[01:34:42.360 --> 01:34:44.600]   We always think we're not lazy, but we're pretty lazy.
[01:34:44.600 --> 01:34:53.840]   He talks about Craig's list, you know, siphoning off, you know, real estate listings from the
[01:34:53.840 --> 01:34:54.840]   newspaper.
[01:34:54.840 --> 01:34:59.000]   He says paradoxically, the same forces that will have classifieds and news to be so easily
[01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:04.600]   separated also drastically increased the economic rationale for bundling across the board.
[01:35:04.600 --> 01:35:13.600]   There are more than 65 million subscribers to over the top packages provided by Netflix
[01:35:13.600 --> 01:35:19.360]   HBO, Hulu, Sling TV, even Amazon Prime TV.
[01:35:19.360 --> 01:35:24.680]   One does not always think of these as bundles, but they're looking more and more like a traditional
[01:35:24.680 --> 01:35:28.040]   cable bundle, right?
[01:35:28.040 --> 01:35:36.840]   So it is a little bit different because with Netflix, I am, well, no, I guess it's not.
[01:35:36.840 --> 01:35:38.440]   It's well, it's cheaper.
[01:35:38.440 --> 01:35:40.000]   It is getting a lot.
[01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:43.480]   That's the really sad thing is that we're now paying more again.
[01:35:43.480 --> 01:35:46.480]   Well, it depends on if you rationalize.
[01:35:46.480 --> 01:35:50.840]   So like we put our Hulu subscription on hold every now and then just because we're like,
[01:35:50.840 --> 01:35:52.720]   eh, I'm not excited about it.
[01:35:52.720 --> 01:35:59.960]   And then we, so all we subscribe to is Netflix and what were prime members.
[01:35:59.960 --> 01:36:02.960]   So in every now and then we pick up Hulu.
[01:36:02.960 --> 01:36:06.920]   Anyway, I meant to talk about that, but I didn't get to.
[01:36:06.920 --> 01:36:07.920]   All right.
[01:36:07.920 --> 01:36:10.640]   Now, Stacy, it's time for your thing.
[01:36:10.640 --> 01:36:14.360]   So this week, I don't have a thing because I'm actually playing with lots of things and
[01:36:14.360 --> 01:36:17.160]   nothing is working the way I do.
[01:36:17.160 --> 01:36:19.160]   Oh, I know that.
[01:36:19.160 --> 01:36:23.120]   Yes, I'm having, I'm having thing issues.
[01:36:23.120 --> 01:36:27.720]   So instead I am punting with I've already forgotten.
[01:36:27.720 --> 01:36:28.720]   That's how.
[01:36:28.720 --> 01:36:31.200]   The Pew report on algorithms it says here.
[01:36:31.200 --> 01:36:32.200]   Yes.
[01:36:32.200 --> 01:36:33.800]   Actually, this is a really good report.
[01:36:33.800 --> 01:36:36.160]   I had another thing that I didn't put it down.
[01:36:36.160 --> 01:36:38.040]   That one I don't know.
[01:36:38.040 --> 01:36:39.880]   I don't remember what it is now.
[01:36:39.880 --> 01:36:41.880]   That's very sorry, you guys.
[01:36:41.880 --> 01:36:44.680]   Oh, wait, did that work?
[01:36:44.680 --> 01:36:45.680]   The link is it dead?
[01:36:45.680 --> 01:36:48.360]   Yeah, the link's dead, but I've got the front page.
[01:36:48.360 --> 01:36:49.360]   Oh, good.
[01:36:49.360 --> 01:36:50.360]   Pew.
[01:36:50.360 --> 01:36:54.680]   It says algorithms are aimed at optimizing everything.
[01:36:54.680 --> 01:37:00.360]   But experts worry they're putting too much control in the hands of corporations and governments.
[01:37:00.360 --> 01:37:04.920]   This is kind of the thing we're talking about with the artificial intelligence, these kind
[01:37:04.920 --> 01:37:07.800]   of biases, hidden biases.
[01:37:07.800 --> 01:37:11.280]   That's why I thought you guys would like it because it really does.
[01:37:11.280 --> 01:37:15.240]   It's an 87 page report, which you may not want to read all of it.
[01:37:15.240 --> 01:37:16.720]   That's okay.
[01:37:16.720 --> 01:37:22.320]   But it does a nice job even on the first page, summarizing what the big issues are.
[01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:24.080]   You can dig into any one of those.
[01:37:24.080 --> 01:37:27.320]   These are the things what's going to happen.
[01:37:27.320 --> 01:37:31.640]   They won't give the O'Neill our favorite author.
[01:37:31.640 --> 01:37:32.720]   Yes.
[01:37:32.720 --> 01:37:36.840]   If you have the time and the interest, you should read it because it's a really good
[01:37:36.840 --> 01:37:38.040]   paper.
[01:37:38.040 --> 01:37:40.000]   It's not hard to understand.
[01:37:40.000 --> 01:37:44.920]   That's always nice because sometimes they are hard to understand.
[01:37:44.920 --> 01:37:45.920]   That's my pick.
[01:37:45.920 --> 01:37:50.840]   Next time I'll have either the Logitech Harmony stuff for you or I will have this magical
[01:37:50.840 --> 01:37:53.440]   streak of I blow I'm trying to create.
[01:37:53.440 --> 01:37:55.600]   We'll see.
[01:37:55.600 --> 01:38:01.040]   Is this kind of though a technopanic Jeff a little bit as we've talked about before?
[01:38:01.040 --> 01:38:12.080]   There's a $27 million fund started at Harvard and IT somewhere up there in Cambridge for
[01:38:12.080 --> 01:38:19.080]   AI ethics.
[01:38:19.080 --> 01:38:20.080]   A little bit different than this.
[01:38:20.080 --> 01:38:24.840]   As I was thinking about this, I was talking to somebody today who helped fund it.
[01:38:24.840 --> 01:38:27.480]   The discussion that I had with, I don't know if I had told you about the discussion I
[01:38:27.480 --> 01:38:36.480]   had with Google a while ago, where I argue that the network, sorry, I'm getting into
[01:38:36.480 --> 01:38:41.200]   the brain space here, I'm arguing that the platforms have to be more transparent about
[01:38:41.200 --> 01:38:45.280]   the manipulation that occurs to them in this fake news world.
[01:38:45.280 --> 01:38:49.440]   I do not argue that they need to be transparent about the algorithms because they'll get
[01:38:49.440 --> 01:38:53.520]   game, but they do need to be transparent about how people are trying to game them and thus
[01:38:53.520 --> 01:38:54.520]   us.
[01:38:54.520 --> 01:38:56.560]   This is a matter of transparency that we need to know.
[01:38:56.560 --> 01:39:01.440]   Point is, when I thought about that more, I realized that this notion of transparency
[01:39:01.440 --> 01:39:05.560]   in algorithms, this notion of we got to know what they're doing doesn't so much matter
[01:39:05.560 --> 01:39:10.400]   because you can't read them, you don't know what they do, but the principles behind the
[01:39:10.400 --> 01:39:16.160]   algorithms need to be published.
[01:39:16.160 --> 01:39:19.480]   I think that's what people are missing here is there's no sense of the rules, there's
[01:39:19.480 --> 01:39:22.280]   no sense of the standards that are given.
[01:39:22.280 --> 01:39:25.040]   In fact, we do get some of that.
[01:39:25.040 --> 01:39:33.680]   We panda, Matt Cudd said this, we're not going to degrade this, we're going to reward that,
[01:39:33.680 --> 01:39:35.880]   and that's the principle that's behind here.
[01:39:35.880 --> 01:39:40.280]   We're telling you the behavior we're rewarding until you mess up gaming it.
[01:39:40.280 --> 01:39:44.360]   Yeah, I think it's a bit of techno panic to say algorithms.
[01:39:44.360 --> 01:39:48.720]   Well newsrooms were algorithms.
[01:39:48.720 --> 01:39:50.520]   Merchandising is an algorithm of a sort.
[01:39:50.520 --> 01:39:53.720]   There's all these decisions that get made and on what basis.
[01:39:53.720 --> 01:39:57.280]   We need to know more about the basis, not the formula and not to worry that I think
[01:39:57.280 --> 01:39:59.800]   it's all this hoo-ha dangerous stuff.
[01:39:59.800 --> 01:40:02.560]   Does that make any sense?
[01:40:02.560 --> 01:40:03.560]   Yes.
[01:40:03.560 --> 01:40:04.800]   Stacy's back in board mode.
[01:40:04.800 --> 01:40:05.800]   No.
[01:40:05.800 --> 01:40:06.800]   And back in what?
[01:40:06.800 --> 01:40:08.160]   No, no, I'm saying yes.
[01:40:08.160 --> 01:40:11.920]   I was nodding, but I think there's a wack of really crazy delay.
[01:40:11.920 --> 01:40:13.840]   Do you want to do a number two, Jeff, for sure.
[01:40:13.840 --> 01:40:14.840]   Sure, sure.
[01:40:14.840 --> 01:40:15.840]   Yes, I do.
[01:40:15.840 --> 01:40:16.840]   Yeah.
[01:40:16.840 --> 01:40:18.480]   Well, I already had it, but you already had it.
[01:40:18.480 --> 01:40:19.480]   You didn't steal it.
[01:40:19.480 --> 01:40:21.480]   You didn't steal it, which is a gift.
[01:40:21.480 --> 01:40:22.480]   No, I did not.
[01:40:22.480 --> 01:40:28.720]   So the number is 122 million, and we're going to get to where that is.
[01:40:28.720 --> 01:40:35.800]   So a really charming, lovely thing in Gates Notes, which is the Gates Foundation, reproduces
[01:40:35.800 --> 01:40:45.760]   a letter that Warren Buffett sent to them in December 2016 that said that he thought
[01:40:45.760 --> 01:40:51.920]   it was a good idea to write a letter about what they're doing in the process of writing
[01:40:51.920 --> 01:40:53.400]   that letter he learned more, he said.
[01:40:53.400 --> 01:40:57.240]   I think, of course, Buffett is so open and generous about this.
[01:40:57.240 --> 01:41:01.320]   Well, there's also a settled backstory to that, which is that Warren Buffett, 10 years
[01:41:01.320 --> 01:41:08.000]   before he wrote that letter, gave them the largest charity donation in the history of
[01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:09.000]   ever.
[01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:10.840]   So it was kind of like, what have you done with it?
[01:41:10.840 --> 01:41:15.920]   So I gave you my money, and he even says, look, you can't judge a charity the same way
[01:41:15.920 --> 01:41:20.240]   you judge a corporation, but I kind of like to know.
[01:41:20.240 --> 01:41:24.120]   He says, what do you think you've done?
[01:41:24.120 --> 01:41:27.240]   What kind of difference has the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation made?
[01:41:27.240 --> 01:41:30.840]   So it's a really charming thing where they come up with these numbers and they have a
[01:41:30.840 --> 01:41:32.920]   written dialogue of Bill and Melinda about this.
[01:41:32.920 --> 01:41:38.720]   So the first number is 122 million, which is the number of children's lives saved since
[01:41:38.720 --> 01:41:40.320]   1990.
[01:41:40.320 --> 01:41:43.520]   And here's the methodology behind that.
[01:41:43.520 --> 01:41:51.120]   It says that if child mortality had stayed at the level of 1990 in the time since, 122
[01:41:51.120 --> 01:41:53.840]   million under the age of five would have died.
[01:41:53.840 --> 01:42:01.040]   But instead we've seen an improvement in young child mortality around a number of factors
[01:42:01.040 --> 01:42:03.240]   that really is amazing.
[01:42:03.240 --> 01:42:08.360]   In a world right now where we can take some goddamn good news, I'll take it.
[01:42:08.360 --> 01:42:10.760]   It's truly, I mean, let that sink in.
[01:42:10.760 --> 01:42:20.320]   Since 1990, 122 million fewer children under five died because of initiatives from the
[01:42:20.320 --> 01:42:27.320]   Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, including inoculations, clean water, poverty, reduced
[01:42:27.320 --> 01:42:29.600]   poverty, people were dying as their poor.
[01:42:29.600 --> 01:42:32.960]   122 million children under five.
[01:42:32.960 --> 01:42:34.320]   It's remarkable.
[01:42:34.320 --> 01:42:38.320]   The number of childhood deaths per year has been cut in half since 1990.
[01:42:38.320 --> 01:42:44.840]   Now it means we got another half to go and we got issues, but it's pretty damned, amazing
[01:42:44.840 --> 01:42:46.080]   and wonderful.
[01:42:46.080 --> 01:42:50.120]   So a couple of other numbers, the best deal is vaccines.
[01:42:50.120 --> 01:42:57.640]   88% of children worldwide receive basic vaccines now, except in some parts of America where
[01:42:57.640 --> 01:43:01.720]   they've gone into a technopanic about them.
[01:43:01.720 --> 01:43:04.600]   But that's wonderful.
[01:43:04.600 --> 01:43:13.040]   One million newborn babies, they reduced newborn mortality.
[01:43:13.040 --> 01:43:20.760]   Last year, about one million infants died on the day they were born.
[01:43:20.760 --> 01:43:24.400]   A total of 2.5 million died in the first month of life.
[01:43:24.400 --> 01:43:27.200]   But I'm not sure what the good news is here.
[01:43:27.200 --> 01:43:33.040]   I guess it's just still too many, but there's been reduced.
[01:43:33.040 --> 01:43:37.520]   And then malnutrition, 45% of child deaths are linked to malnutrition.
[01:43:37.520 --> 01:43:43.520]   So they show a picture in here of a line that shows the standard, the WHO standard for nine
[01:43:43.520 --> 01:43:50.560]   year olds and the nine year olds in this photo below it, the issue of malnutrition all around.
[01:43:50.560 --> 01:43:56.120]   Very important, Melinda Gates' number, a French Gates number, 300 million is the number of
[01:43:56.120 --> 01:44:00.240]   women in the developing world who use modern contraceptives.
[01:44:00.240 --> 01:44:06.200]   And she has to replace all of the people who've lost coverage due to underfunding and defunding
[01:44:06.200 --> 01:44:08.600]   of Planned Parenthood in the United States.
[01:44:08.600 --> 01:44:10.520]   Under you know who.
[01:44:10.520 --> 01:44:18.120]   So it's a really, I love this because it really shows that that money, and it's a lot of money,
[01:44:18.120 --> 01:44:19.720]   has made a big, big, big difference.
[01:44:19.720 --> 01:44:20.720]   It's great.
[01:44:20.720 --> 01:44:26.400]   And Bill Gates said this for a long time, he was challenged because he was not a philanthropist
[01:44:26.400 --> 01:44:27.400]   and didn't give away money.
[01:44:27.400 --> 01:44:30.040]   He says, "I don't want to do it until I can do it right."
[01:44:30.040 --> 01:44:34.360]   And the famous counter examples, Mark Zuckerberg, who gave how much to the New York City schools,
[01:44:34.360 --> 01:44:36.360]   100 million or 20 million.
[01:44:36.360 --> 01:44:42.040]   And yeah, kind of to no good purpose.
[01:44:42.040 --> 01:44:44.320]   And so you does take work.
[01:44:44.320 --> 01:44:46.480]   And Bill says, "I'm not going to really do this until I retire."
[01:44:46.480 --> 01:44:49.840]   Actually, after he got married to Melinda, she said, "Look, I'm going to do it and I'm
[01:44:49.840 --> 01:44:53.120]   going to convince you to start giving money even before you're retired."
[01:44:53.120 --> 01:44:54.280]   But now they've given away.
[01:44:54.280 --> 01:44:56.720]   They've drawn it on a basis of their true leaders.
[01:44:56.720 --> 01:44:59.280]   And they're absolutely inspiring.
[01:44:59.280 --> 01:45:04.960]   There's a new documentary on HBO about Warren Buffett that also talks about him and the
[01:45:04.960 --> 01:45:07.800]   money he's made and how he's giving almost all of it away as well.
[01:45:07.800 --> 01:45:10.320]   It's really remarkable.
[01:45:10.320 --> 01:45:12.080]   My favorite in this is actually 1%.
[01:45:12.080 --> 01:45:15.240]   It's the percentage of people surveyed who knew that extreme poverty has been cut in
[01:45:15.240 --> 01:45:16.960]   half since 1990.
[01:45:16.960 --> 01:45:17.960]   People just don't know this.
[01:45:17.960 --> 01:45:19.280]   The world is improving.
[01:45:19.280 --> 01:45:22.840]   All this argument about how the world's in terrible shape and awful things are happening.
[01:45:22.840 --> 01:45:24.720]   And there's other authors who talk about this.
[01:45:24.720 --> 01:45:26.720]   No, the world is getting better.
[01:45:26.720 --> 01:45:28.280]   It's safer than it's been.
[01:45:28.280 --> 01:45:30.200]   We're saving more lives than ever.
[01:45:30.200 --> 01:45:32.720]   There are far more people out of poverty than ever.
[01:45:32.720 --> 01:45:35.720]   Have you read Stephen Pinker's book?
[01:45:35.720 --> 01:45:37.800]   That's what I was just exactly thinking of.
[01:45:37.800 --> 01:45:39.160]   Yes, Pinker's great with us.
[01:45:39.160 --> 01:45:41.400]   I haven't read it, so tell me about it.
[01:45:41.400 --> 01:45:45.560]   It's called The Better Angels of Our Nature, I believe.
[01:45:45.560 --> 01:45:47.840]   And that is Jeff just summed it up.
[01:45:47.840 --> 01:45:49.920]   That's why I was like, "Oh, Jeff, have you read this?"
[01:45:49.920 --> 01:45:51.200]   It's really dense, though.
[01:45:51.200 --> 01:45:52.200]   I will tell you.
[01:45:52.200 --> 01:45:53.800]   It is, but it's very good.
[01:45:53.800 --> 01:45:54.800]   It is very good.
[01:45:54.800 --> 01:45:57.760]   Pinker also did another book, oh, what was the other book he did?
[01:45:57.760 --> 01:46:00.720]   Matt Ridley did a book that's similar.
[01:46:00.720 --> 01:46:02.760]   Is it less intense?
[01:46:02.760 --> 01:46:06.800]   Okay, so it's The Better Angels of Our Nature.
[01:46:06.800 --> 01:46:11.720]   Why violence has declined.
[01:46:11.720 --> 01:46:12.720]   Declined.
[01:46:12.720 --> 01:46:13.720]   Nice.
[01:46:13.720 --> 01:46:17.160]   Matt Ridley wrote the rational optimist.
[01:46:17.160 --> 01:46:18.720]   I think it is.
[01:46:18.720 --> 01:46:19.720]   Yes.
[01:46:19.720 --> 01:46:20.720]   Evolution of optimism.
[01:46:20.720 --> 01:46:22.120]   Yeah, we need some optimistic stuff.
[01:46:22.120 --> 01:46:24.120]   We need a little bit of optimism.
[01:46:24.120 --> 01:46:25.120]   It's really good.
[01:46:25.120 --> 01:46:27.240]   The other thing in the letter that's just great, just one of those wonderful charming
[01:46:27.240 --> 01:46:36.960]   moments where they put in a picture of Bill and Warren in a McDonald's in Hong Kong,
[01:46:36.960 --> 01:46:42.120]   where Warren, because he eats, I think, a bit like Trump does, wanted to have lunch.
[01:46:42.120 --> 01:46:49.960]   You offered to pay, says Bill, to Warren, dug into your pocket and pulled out coupons.
[01:46:49.960 --> 01:46:53.360]   Linda just found this photo of me in The Big Spender.
[01:46:53.360 --> 01:46:56.400]   Remind us how much you value a good deal.
[01:46:56.400 --> 01:46:59.800]   So that's a charming little one.
[01:46:59.800 --> 01:47:00.800]   Nice.
[01:47:00.800 --> 01:47:02.440]   Hey, I use coupons.
[01:47:02.440 --> 01:47:03.440]   I'll be honest.
[01:47:03.440 --> 01:47:04.440]   Oh, yeah.
[01:47:04.440 --> 01:47:07.880]   Yeah, but you're not the third richest person in the world.
[01:47:07.880 --> 01:47:11.000]   Hey, how do you think you get there?
[01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:12.000]   Not by coupons.
[01:47:12.000 --> 01:47:14.040]   I guarantee it.
[01:47:14.040 --> 01:47:18.480]   All right, fine.
[01:47:18.480 --> 01:47:25.040]   All right, now that you've all been cheered up, I'm going to tell you how you could protect
[01:47:25.040 --> 01:47:28.160]   your privacy against an over-intrusive government.
[01:47:28.160 --> 01:47:34.880]   One of the things people we haven't talked about politics at all today, but one of the
[01:47:34.880 --> 01:47:41.800]   current breaking news story scared me a little bit because we've talked about the surveillance
[01:47:41.800 --> 01:47:44.320]   state in the years since Edward Stone's revelations.
[01:47:44.320 --> 01:47:53.120]   We talk a lot about overreaching surveillance by the NSA and other state security organizations.
[01:47:53.120 --> 01:48:00.480]   And what we're seeing happen play out right now is an example of our intelligence community
[01:48:00.480 --> 01:48:06.720]   deciding to weigh in on the politics of the nation, not by going to Congress and saying,
[01:48:06.720 --> 01:48:10.240]   you know, here's what we know and you ought to be doing an investigation, but by going
[01:48:10.240 --> 01:48:12.320]   directly to the public and the press.
[01:48:12.320 --> 01:48:21.560]   And it scares me a little bit because one of the worst things that could happen is a surveillance
[01:48:21.560 --> 01:48:25.920]   state using its knowledge and power against its citizens.
[01:48:25.920 --> 01:48:27.840]   So let's all encrypt.
[01:48:27.840 --> 01:48:29.360]   What do you say?
[01:48:29.360 --> 01:48:35.040]   And this is a company, a website that I've talked about for some time, Keybase.io.
[01:48:35.040 --> 01:48:43.920]   It starts as kind of a PGP server, so you can keep track of your PGP.
[01:48:43.920 --> 01:48:48.440]   You can actually make a key there and then distribute it and follow other people if their
[01:48:48.440 --> 01:48:49.720]   key changes.
[01:48:49.720 --> 01:48:58.000]   But they've just released this week an app that does all of that and has encrypted chat
[01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:00.240]   built into it using your PGP encryption.
[01:49:00.240 --> 01:49:01.240]   It's done right.
[01:49:01.240 --> 01:49:03.080]   It's very impressive.
[01:49:03.080 --> 01:49:04.800]   Keybase.io.
[01:49:04.800 --> 01:49:07.640]   Here's the app.
[01:49:07.640 --> 01:49:10.320]   And people have started chatting with me a little bit.
[01:49:10.320 --> 01:49:12.480]   I've had some conversations already on it.
[01:49:12.480 --> 01:49:14.080]   These are secure chats.
[01:49:14.080 --> 01:49:20.880]   You also have a secure file system that you can have public information, but also have
[01:49:20.880 --> 01:49:26.480]   a shared file folders with real people that are totally encrypted using public key crypto.
[01:49:26.480 --> 01:49:31.120]   So only you and they have access to the contents of it.
[01:49:31.120 --> 01:49:35.800]   You can attach your keys to your devices and you see I have many keys attached to many
[01:49:35.800 --> 01:49:40.080]   devices and manage them that way.
[01:49:40.080 --> 01:49:43.960]   I understand that PGP is a little opaque.
[01:49:43.960 --> 01:49:46.800]   The idea of a crypto is a little opaque to people.
[01:49:46.800 --> 01:49:51.960]   Very famously, Edward Snowden's revelations were delayed because Glenn Greenwald couldn't
[01:49:51.960 --> 01:49:53.800]   figure out how to use PGP.
[01:49:53.800 --> 01:49:59.680]   And Snowden says, "I'm not talking to you unless we can have a secure conversation."
[01:49:59.680 --> 01:50:04.520]   This would be a good time to kind of bone up on the basics of crypto and how you can use
[01:50:04.520 --> 01:50:08.320]   it to communicate privately.
[01:50:08.320 --> 01:50:10.760]   And I would suggest everybody visit keybase.io.
[01:50:10.760 --> 01:50:15.160]   What did you think about the story that there was some who were complaining that government
[01:50:15.160 --> 01:50:17.080]   people were starting to use it?
[01:50:17.080 --> 01:50:18.080]   It's a good and bad, right?
[01:50:18.080 --> 01:50:20.840]   They were trying to avoid some...
[01:50:20.840 --> 01:50:26.120]   Yeah, the people in the White House were using a chat app that destroys the messages
[01:50:26.120 --> 01:50:27.840]   it's received.
[01:50:27.840 --> 01:50:31.920]   You know, like burn after reading.
[01:50:31.920 --> 01:50:33.920]   I don't know.
[01:50:33.920 --> 01:50:42.880]   The problem is that what strikes me is that our republic, our experiment in this country
[01:50:42.880 --> 01:50:46.400]   is more fragile than we really realized.
[01:50:46.400 --> 01:50:53.480]   And it relies upon a consensus and a willingness of all the people to participate.
[01:50:53.480 --> 01:50:59.960]   And when there is a vacuum of power, unfortunately, what you see is people who want power kind
[01:50:59.960 --> 01:51:00.960]   of stepping in.
[01:51:00.960 --> 01:51:01.960]   And it really...
[01:51:01.960 --> 01:51:06.720]   It scares me that the intelligence community has decided rightly or wrongly.
[01:51:06.720 --> 01:51:13.120]   I'm not sure I disagree with it, but has decided to take down Michael Flynn.
[01:51:13.120 --> 01:51:16.760]   This is an article from The Week by Damon Linker.
[01:51:16.760 --> 01:51:19.760]   And he says, "Look, Flynn deserved to be taken down.
[01:51:19.760 --> 01:51:26.720]   But I'm not a fan of Flynn, but there's something much more concerning here which is
[01:51:26.720 --> 01:51:34.040]   unelected, unknown intelligence analysts using their knowledge and power, the power of a
[01:51:34.040 --> 01:51:38.400]   surveillance state to influence politics is a little scary."
[01:51:38.400 --> 01:51:43.120]   Well, I think, I mean, one of the challenges though is they couldn't leak it to Congress,
[01:51:43.120 --> 01:51:48.080]   which historically would have been what would have happened because Congress right now,
[01:51:48.080 --> 01:51:54.160]   one of our stop-stop gaps, what sort I'm looking for.
[01:51:54.160 --> 01:51:55.160]   Backstop.
[01:51:55.160 --> 01:51:57.160]   Backstop, thank you.
[01:51:57.160 --> 01:52:01.720]   Isn't working because Congress isn't standing up to the president on things.
[01:52:01.720 --> 01:52:04.040]   Well, I would say that the...
[01:52:04.040 --> 01:52:10.000]   See, part of the problem is that this whole system is designed to move at a snail's pace.
[01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:12.600]   I think that might be good in certain cases.
[01:52:12.600 --> 01:52:16.480]   I think it is very good in general.
[01:52:16.480 --> 01:52:19.000]   And I think the intelligence community is...
[01:52:19.000 --> 01:52:24.560]   The snail's pace could include nothing happens till the midterm election when people decide
[01:52:24.560 --> 01:52:28.560]   that they're going to vote the sons of guns out and replace them with somebody who will
[01:52:28.560 --> 01:52:29.760]   do something about it.
[01:52:29.760 --> 01:52:34.240]   But for now, these are our elected representatives doing what they were elected to do.
[01:52:34.240 --> 01:52:37.040]   And I don't want to sub-borne them.
[01:52:37.040 --> 01:52:43.880]   Yeah, I recognize the paradox of my position because I was enraged that Donald Trump was
[01:52:43.880 --> 01:52:45.840]   a government in politics.
[01:52:45.840 --> 01:52:51.200]   He was trying to delegitimize Barack Obama and know he's the president.
[01:52:51.200 --> 01:52:53.720]   And now what am I saying?
[01:52:53.720 --> 01:52:55.760]   My delegitimizeing Donald Trump.
[01:52:55.760 --> 01:52:58.920]   It depends on part on his behavior.
[01:52:58.920 --> 01:53:03.880]   If we find out certain things, then yeah, I have a question of legitimacy.
[01:53:03.880 --> 01:53:04.880]   And if he does things...
[01:53:04.880 --> 01:53:06.600]   But I think we need to use the process.
[01:53:06.600 --> 01:53:10.120]   I think we need to use the process and not bypass the process.
[01:53:10.120 --> 01:53:11.840]   But the process is...
[01:53:11.840 --> 01:53:13.560]   This is the problem now with the institutions.
[01:53:13.560 --> 01:53:14.560]   The process is broken.
[01:53:14.560 --> 01:53:19.440]   It's a mistake then to bypass it because that's just going to bring the entire institution
[01:53:19.440 --> 01:53:20.600]   down around our heads.
[01:53:20.600 --> 01:53:21.600]   Let's fix it.
[01:53:21.600 --> 01:53:22.600]   I think it's happening anyway.
[01:53:22.600 --> 01:53:24.520]   That's the bigger question.
[01:53:24.520 --> 01:53:25.640]   I would like to fix it.
[01:53:25.640 --> 01:53:29.200]   I would like to take the power of money out of politics.
[01:53:29.200 --> 01:53:32.080]   I would like to eliminate gerrymandering.
[01:53:32.080 --> 01:53:37.880]   I would like to see fair elections and voting rights.
[01:53:37.880 --> 01:53:41.000]   And then let's have those representatives do that.
[01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:42.520]   And how the hell do you get from here?
[01:53:42.520 --> 01:53:43.520]   You can't get that.
[01:53:43.520 --> 01:53:46.320]   If you're having spies release the content to surveillance...
[01:53:46.320 --> 01:53:47.320]   Well, no.
[01:53:47.320 --> 01:53:51.680]   If you at some point know if they know that if officials and all levels of...
[01:53:51.680 --> 01:53:53.520]   There's another check and balance in us as the system.
[01:53:53.520 --> 01:53:57.480]   You're saying that illegal bad things are happening that are dangerous to the country.
[01:53:57.480 --> 01:53:58.480]   And you know it in government.
[01:53:58.480 --> 01:54:01.840]   Don't you have a responsibility to let the public know?
[01:54:01.840 --> 01:54:04.080]   That's what they're doing is letting the public...
[01:54:04.080 --> 01:54:05.080]   Well, public.
[01:54:05.080 --> 01:54:06.080]   This is the problem.
[01:54:06.080 --> 01:54:07.080]   And they're using...
[01:54:07.080 --> 01:54:08.080]   We don't know what they're letting...
[01:54:08.080 --> 01:54:09.080]   First Amendment.
[01:54:09.080 --> 01:54:10.080]   But we don't know.
[01:54:10.080 --> 01:54:11.520]   Like it's not like a complete data dump.
[01:54:11.520 --> 01:54:16.520]   It's like selective choice of the surveillance we have to...
[01:54:16.520 --> 01:54:17.800]   That's what all leaks are.
[01:54:17.800 --> 01:54:18.800]   And that's where you...
[01:54:18.800 --> 01:54:19.800]   Yeah.
[01:54:19.800 --> 01:54:21.920]   You appreciate reporters who know what they're getting.
[01:54:21.920 --> 01:54:22.920]   I agree.
[01:54:22.920 --> 01:54:23.920]   And who...
[01:54:23.920 --> 01:54:24.920]   I agree.
[01:54:24.920 --> 01:54:25.920]   But yeah.
[01:54:25.920 --> 01:54:26.920]   I worry.
[01:54:26.920 --> 01:54:27.920]   I just worry.
[01:54:27.920 --> 01:54:32.320]   We have such a beautiful thing that we've created with this report.
[01:54:32.320 --> 01:54:35.760]   I think every institution is mortally challenged.
[01:54:35.760 --> 01:54:36.760]   Every institution.
[01:54:36.760 --> 01:54:37.760]   Yeah.
[01:54:37.760 --> 01:54:41.480]   And the reason we see the nation challenged, and that's why nationalism rises.
[01:54:41.480 --> 01:54:42.480]   I guess what Snowden...
[01:54:42.480 --> 01:54:46.480]   Is it what Snowden did the same thing?
[01:54:46.480 --> 01:54:50.400]   I feel like it's not because I feel like the release of information from the intelligence
[01:54:50.400 --> 01:54:52.320]   community this time was at hominem.
[01:54:52.320 --> 01:54:53.320]   No.
[01:54:53.320 --> 01:54:57.240]   I think it was the same thing because he found things that he felt were bad.
[01:54:57.240 --> 01:54:59.680]   He says that he tried to take it through channels.
[01:54:59.680 --> 01:55:00.680]   He couldn't.
[01:55:00.680 --> 01:55:03.400]   So he went to the press and he trusted the press to do a good job with it.
[01:55:03.400 --> 01:55:06.280]   So whoever did these did the same thing.
[01:55:06.280 --> 01:55:08.600]   They said something rotten is going on here.
[01:55:08.600 --> 01:55:10.240]   The system won't work.
[01:55:10.240 --> 01:55:13.160]   And so that's why we have the press.
[01:55:13.160 --> 01:55:14.840]   It's an institution to it.
[01:55:14.840 --> 01:55:15.840]   It's the fourth...
[01:55:15.840 --> 01:55:16.840]   Our state.
[01:55:16.840 --> 01:55:17.840]   It's the first state.
[01:55:17.840 --> 01:55:18.840]   The fourth state.
[01:55:18.840 --> 01:55:22.560]   And so no, I think it was legitimate use of the fourth state.
[01:55:22.560 --> 01:55:27.440]   Now, if you just took the stuff and put it up through WikiLeaks and put it up online and
[01:55:27.440 --> 01:55:30.560]   lies were lost, different issue.
[01:55:30.560 --> 01:55:31.560]   But or if you didn't...
[01:55:31.560 --> 01:55:33.040]   Let's count up with the question.
[01:55:33.040 --> 01:55:37.960]   We really are counting on the press at this point, then to vet the material they've been
[01:55:37.960 --> 01:55:38.960]   given by spies.
[01:55:38.960 --> 01:55:39.960]   Now we are.
[01:55:39.960 --> 01:55:41.960]   And to use it responsibly.
[01:55:41.960 --> 01:55:42.960]   Yes.
[01:55:42.960 --> 01:55:48.440]   And then I think we all need to put pressure on Congress, which has full access to this
[01:55:48.440 --> 01:55:49.440]   information.
[01:55:49.440 --> 01:55:50.440]   That's what's happening.
[01:55:50.440 --> 01:55:52.000]   This is all the same.
[01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:56.520]   This is how it works normally is we aren't privileged to know that information, but our
[01:55:56.520 --> 01:56:00.280]   representatives in Congress are and we expect them to act upon that information.
[01:56:00.280 --> 01:56:01.280]   Yes.
[01:56:01.280 --> 01:56:06.320]   So what you want, Leo, in the end is that the dribs that come out into the press put pressure
[01:56:06.320 --> 01:56:11.600]   on Congress to say we have to hold a decent inquiry, which has not happened yet.
[01:56:11.600 --> 01:56:16.760]   But if they're pressured enough to do so, then they will do their job and they were forced
[01:56:16.760 --> 01:56:18.680]   to do their job by this process.
[01:56:18.680 --> 01:56:24.560]   Meanwhile, another rumor that Snowden might be handed over by the Russians is a gift.
[01:56:24.560 --> 01:56:25.560]   Oh, the gift.
[01:56:25.560 --> 01:56:27.520]   Thank you, note.
[01:56:27.520 --> 01:56:34.400]   I wonder how is it that Snowden ended up in Russia of all places, you know?
[01:56:34.400 --> 01:56:37.760]   Well, don't forget who helped convince them to go there.
[01:56:37.760 --> 01:56:38.760]   Who's that?
[01:56:38.760 --> 01:56:39.760]   I'm Greenwald.
[01:56:39.760 --> 01:56:40.760]   Nope.
[01:56:40.760 --> 01:56:41.760]   Laura Poitras.
[01:56:41.760 --> 01:56:42.760]   Assange.
[01:56:42.760 --> 01:56:45.040]   Shule in a song.
[01:56:45.040 --> 01:56:46.360]   Says one report.
[01:56:46.360 --> 01:56:47.360]   Yeah.
[01:56:47.360 --> 01:56:48.360]   Interesting.
[01:56:48.360 --> 01:56:51.720]   You know, this is why conspiracy theories start because don't you feel like there's a
[01:56:51.720 --> 01:56:55.000]   lot going on that we don't know beneath the surface?
[01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:57.240]   There's always a lot going on that we don't know beneath the surface.
[01:56:57.240 --> 01:57:03.440]   And so the natural desire is to project upon that some story, some explanation.
[01:57:03.440 --> 01:57:06.440]   However, far-fetched.
[01:57:06.440 --> 01:57:13.360]   I guess the vacuum leaves room for lots of things to be projected.
[01:57:13.360 --> 01:57:15.040]   Anyway, enough of that.
[01:57:15.040 --> 01:57:17.760]   We came so close to not having politics on this show.
[01:57:17.760 --> 01:57:23.760]   This is very germane because we've been talking for four years about the Snowden leaks, about
[01:57:23.760 --> 01:57:26.200]   the surveillance state, about how to protect yourself.
[01:57:26.200 --> 01:57:27.200]   Nope.
[01:57:27.200 --> 01:57:30.920]   And I think it's appropriate at this point to do what I did and all I really intended
[01:57:30.920 --> 01:57:36.520]   to do, which is to raise the warning that this is the fruit of, in some respect, a
[01:57:36.520 --> 01:57:40.520]   poisoned tree.
[01:57:40.520 --> 01:57:41.520]   That's all.
[01:57:41.520 --> 01:57:42.520]   That's all.
[01:57:42.520 --> 01:57:44.760]   And you guys may, I guess you did too.
[01:57:44.760 --> 01:57:50.760]   Both of you made excellent arguments of why that, you know, you have to consider this.
[01:57:50.760 --> 01:57:52.760]   But I just, I think we should raise that issue.
[01:57:52.760 --> 01:57:56.320]   And I don't, I don't know if anybody else is going to talk about that.
[01:57:56.320 --> 01:58:02.680]   Ah, and everybody should get a burner phone and use PGP encryption and not, and not take
[01:58:02.680 --> 01:58:03.680]   your phone abroad.
[01:58:03.680 --> 01:58:06.520]   Oh, that's another scary story.
[01:58:06.520 --> 01:58:09.120]   I don't know, you know, we're traveling abroad.
[01:58:09.120 --> 01:58:11.200]   We're going to Cuba at the end of the year.
[01:58:11.200 --> 01:58:12.520]   I'm a biophone.
[01:58:12.520 --> 01:58:16.440]   I am not bringing my smartphone and computers to Cuba, right?
[01:58:16.440 --> 01:58:19.920]   Buy yourself a burner, man.
[01:58:19.920 --> 01:58:23.800]   I don't know what, you know, exactly, not that there's anything on my phone that, see,
[01:58:23.800 --> 01:58:24.800]   that's the other side of it.
[01:58:24.800 --> 01:58:25.800]   There's nothing on my phone.
[01:58:25.800 --> 01:58:30.720]   I would hide that you know, it's just in principle.
[01:58:30.720 --> 01:58:31.720]   I don't like it.
[01:58:31.720 --> 01:58:32.720]   What do you mean?
[01:58:32.720 --> 01:58:33.720]   You think, did you put something on my phone?
[01:58:33.720 --> 01:58:38.200]   No, but the data from your phone can be used to determine all kinds of crazy things,
[01:58:38.200 --> 01:58:41.400]   or someone could plant something on your phone while it's in there.
[01:58:41.400 --> 01:58:42.400]   Good point.
[01:58:42.400 --> 01:58:47.080]   I mean, if we're going to get paranoid and talk about conspiracy theories, good point.
[01:58:47.080 --> 01:58:50.240]   Well, at least I'm not a NASA scientist.
[01:58:50.240 --> 01:58:51.240]   Those guys are so much.
[01:58:51.240 --> 01:58:52.240]   Yeah.
[01:58:52.240 --> 01:58:53.240]   All right.
[01:58:53.240 --> 01:58:54.240]   Thank you everybody.
[01:58:54.240 --> 01:59:00.800]   Thank you, Jeff Jarvis, City University of New York, Professor of Journalism, and author
[01:59:00.800 --> 01:59:03.120]   of many a great book, including What Would Google Do?

[01:59:08.840 --> 01:59:16.720]   You see that your colleague across the way, Jay Rosen's looking for a podcast network?
[01:59:16.720 --> 01:59:18.360]   Should we invite him on the show?
[01:59:18.360 --> 01:59:19.360]   Yeah, sure.
[01:59:19.360 --> 01:59:20.360]   All right.
[01:59:20.360 --> 01:59:21.360]   Sure.
[01:59:21.360 --> 01:59:22.360]   Get him on.
[01:59:22.360 --> 01:59:24.000]   Yeah.
[01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:29.280]   We also want to encourage everybody to follow Stacey Higginbotham.
[01:59:29.280 --> 01:59:30.280]   Stacey.
[01:59:30.280 --> 01:59:31.280]   Yeah.
[01:59:31.280 --> 01:59:32.280]   IOT.com.
[01:59:32.280 --> 01:59:34.320]   IOTpodcast.com.
[01:59:34.320 --> 01:59:39.080]   Your friend Kevin Tofel, I had no idea he was a sprinter.
[01:59:39.080 --> 01:59:40.840]   Oh, yeah.
[01:59:40.840 --> 01:59:47.920]   He's he might be in the top 10 in his age bracket for 400 meter.
[01:59:47.920 --> 01:59:48.920]   Was it 400 meter?
[01:59:48.920 --> 01:59:49.920]   I think it's 400 meter.
[01:59:49.920 --> 01:59:50.920]   Yeah.
[01:59:50.920 --> 01:59:53.000]   He won a big 400 meter race.
[01:59:53.000 --> 01:59:55.440]   Yeah, he's never nine now.
[01:59:55.440 --> 01:59:57.400]   In the world or in the US?
[01:59:57.400 --> 01:59:58.680]   Oh, look, it matters.
[01:59:58.680 --> 01:59:59.920]   It's in the US.
[01:59:59.920 --> 02:00:02.600]   How old is he?
[02:00:02.600 --> 02:00:06.040]   You know, I don't actually know.
[02:00:06.040 --> 02:00:07.040]   You got to watch this.
[02:00:07.040 --> 02:00:08.040]   This is amazing.
[02:00:08.040 --> 02:00:10.040]   This is Kevin Tofel.
[02:00:10.040 --> 02:00:12.240]   In the front there, that's Kevin.
[02:00:12.240 --> 02:00:15.160]   It's a couple of laps.
[02:00:15.160 --> 02:00:16.160]   Where is this?
[02:00:16.160 --> 02:00:18.560]   This is some event in the ocean breeze.
[02:00:18.560 --> 02:00:21.640]   Look at him running 400 meter.
[02:00:21.640 --> 02:00:23.960]   He's a couple.
[02:00:23.960 --> 02:00:24.960]   It's a record, right?
[02:00:24.960 --> 02:00:26.360]   He got a record or something.
[02:00:26.360 --> 02:00:27.360]   He won.
[02:00:27.360 --> 02:00:28.360]   That's the main thing.
[02:00:28.360 --> 02:00:31.960]   He won and I know he just plays the ninth guy in the world.
[02:00:31.960 --> 02:00:32.960]   Here he comes.
[02:00:32.960 --> 02:00:34.160]   Because he was 10th or sorry in the US.
[02:00:34.160 --> 02:00:35.160]   Look at that.
[02:00:35.160 --> 02:00:36.160]   Look how far ahead he is.
[02:00:36.160 --> 02:00:37.160]   Look at Kevin.
[02:00:37.160 --> 02:00:38.160]   He's coming in.
[02:00:38.160 --> 02:00:39.560]   He's coming to the wire.
[02:00:39.560 --> 02:00:40.560]   He's coming.
[02:00:40.560 --> 02:00:41.560]   He's going.
[02:00:41.560 --> 02:00:42.560]   He is.
[02:00:42.560 --> 02:00:45.200]   Oh, how old is he?
[02:00:45.200 --> 02:00:46.800]   I don't know.
[02:00:46.800 --> 02:00:48.120]   He better be in his 20s.
[02:00:48.120 --> 02:00:49.120]   That's all I can say.
[02:00:49.120 --> 02:00:50.120]   No, no.
[02:00:50.120 --> 02:00:51.120]   He's older than I am.
[02:00:51.120 --> 02:00:52.120]   I know that's what I'm saying.
[02:00:52.120 --> 02:00:54.440]   So he's doing it's a master's race, right?
[02:00:54.440 --> 02:00:55.440]   Yeah.
[02:00:55.440 --> 02:00:56.440]   Oh, yeah.
[02:00:56.440 --> 02:00:57.440]   Masters.
[02:00:57.440 --> 02:00:58.440]   That's what they call it.
[02:00:58.440 --> 02:00:59.440]   Yeah.
[02:00:59.440 --> 02:01:00.440]   Pretty impressive.
[02:01:00.440 --> 02:01:01.440]   Kevin Tofel.
[02:01:01.440 --> 02:01:02.440]   Yeah, Kevin.
[02:01:02.440 --> 02:01:03.440]   He won.
[02:01:03.440 --> 02:01:04.440]   He won.
[02:01:04.440 --> 02:01:06.160]   Thank you all for being here.
[02:01:06.160 --> 02:01:07.840]   We do this week in Google.
[02:01:07.840 --> 02:01:08.840]   Look at that.
[02:01:08.840 --> 02:01:10.760]   There you go.
[02:01:10.760 --> 02:01:12.440]   Kevin Tofel number one.
[02:01:12.440 --> 02:01:13.760]   Numera Uno.
[02:01:13.760 --> 02:01:17.720]   It was the US ATF New York Open Masters Championship.
[02:01:17.720 --> 02:01:20.320]   400 meters in a minute and four seconds.
[02:01:20.320 --> 02:01:21.320]   What?
[02:01:21.320 --> 02:01:24.320]   That's not even possible.
[02:01:24.320 --> 02:01:27.480]   We do this show.
[02:01:27.480 --> 02:01:32.240]   If I did it, it would be an hour and force four minutes.
[02:01:32.240 --> 02:01:37.000]   We do this show every Wednesday, 130 Pacific, 430 Eastern, 2130 UTC.
[02:01:37.000 --> 02:01:38.280]   I hope you'll tune in and watch us live.
[02:01:38.280 --> 02:01:41.280]   Join us in the chatroom, IRC.twit.tv.
[02:01:41.280 --> 02:01:47.640]   If you can't on demand, you could find everything we do at Twit.tv.
[02:01:47.640 --> 02:01:55.760]   In this case, Twit.tv/twig or on YouTube Live or YouTube or everywhere.
[02:01:55.760 --> 02:01:59.240]   Just find Twig and listen every week.
[02:01:59.240 --> 02:02:01.720]   I hope you like this show because I like doing it.
[02:02:01.720 --> 02:02:03.760]   I love doing it with these guys.
[02:02:03.760 --> 02:02:06.040]   Kevin Tofel is 47 according to Wikipedia.
[02:02:06.040 --> 02:02:07.040]   Wow.
[02:02:07.040 --> 02:02:08.040]   It's way too close.
[02:02:08.040 --> 02:02:09.680]   You got a Wikipedia page?
[02:02:09.680 --> 02:02:10.680]   I don't know.
[02:02:10.680 --> 02:02:12.720]   According to the chatroom.
[02:02:12.720 --> 02:02:13.720]   You sound jealous.
[02:02:13.720 --> 02:02:17.720]   I don't have a Wikipedia page.
[02:02:17.720 --> 02:02:19.720]   If Kevin has one, I better have one.
[02:02:19.720 --> 02:02:23.480]   I'm like, "Tang, I've never really felt competitive about Wikipedia pages before.
[02:02:23.480 --> 02:02:25.480]   But Tang, maybe he doesn't.
[02:02:25.480 --> 02:02:27.080]   Maybe I just, somebody in the chatroom said it.
[02:02:27.080 --> 02:02:28.080]   I assume it was.
[02:02:28.080 --> 02:02:29.080]   I don't know.
[02:02:29.080 --> 02:02:30.080]   How else do you find it?
[02:02:30.080 --> 02:02:31.080]   How do you find it?
[02:02:31.080 --> 02:02:32.080]   How old is somebody as if it's not on Wikipedia?
[02:02:32.080 --> 02:02:35.080]   You know, he has a good Google+ profile, so maybe it's there.
[02:02:35.080 --> 02:02:36.080]   That's it.
[02:02:36.080 --> 02:02:37.080]   Thanks for joining us.
[02:02:37.080 --> 02:02:39.680]   We'll see y'all next time on this week in Google.
