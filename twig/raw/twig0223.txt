[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.880]   It's time for "Toyk" this week in Google.
[00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:03.160]   The new Nexus 5 is here.
[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:06.600]   We'll have a review of that and the KitKat operating system.
[00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:07.920]   Look at that Google barge.
[00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.320]   We finally know what it's for.
[00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:10.560]   Or do we?
[00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.200]   And who will help out?
[00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.520]   So here we'll talk about that all next on This Week in Google.
[00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:21.880]   Netcast, you love.
[00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.240]   From people you trust.

[00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.480]   And we've got a great panel joining us as always.
[00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.440]   Gina Trapani, smarterwear.org.
[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.400]   I say as always, except we're going to lose you in December.
[00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.360]   And I'm so sad about that.
[00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:17.480]   No, I'll be back.
[00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:18.280]   I'll be back.
[00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.080]   She's moving to Brooklyn and we're never going to see her again.
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.960]   No, just going to take a couple of weeks off
[00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.200]   from having definite appointments because I'll be couch surfing
[00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.840]   and living out of a suitcase there for a little bit.
[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.880]   As somebody who just packed and moved and I'm still unpacking,
[00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.040]   it's horrible.
[00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.920]   It's the most horrible thing that you will ever do.
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.240]   It's the quickest way to change your self-perception
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.640]   from minimalist to hoarder.
[00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.000]   Like, I just started packing and I hate myself already.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.680]   Like, why do I have all this stuff?
[00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:49.640]   Why do I have all this stuff?
[00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.800]   So having a big garage sale before we leave.
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.200]   Yeah, that's a good idea.
[00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.360]   Somebody told me that, get rid of everything.
[00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.200]   Yeah, we're just editing this.
[00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.200]   Throw it out.
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.920]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.240]   Eight is not worth trucking across the country.
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.200]   We're selling it and we're going to start new, which is good.
[00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.080]   Well, I think we good luck with the move.
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.960]   Good luck with the pack.
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.480]   It's hard when kids.
[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:12.480]   But you're at the right side of that.
[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.840]   See, what's really hard is when you have kids
[00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.120]   like who are 11 or 12.
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.640]   Yeah.
[00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.280]   And then they don't want you to throw out anything
[00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.080]   from their entire childhood.
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.720]   Yeah.
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.240]   Yeah, Ed is still small enough that we actually still kind
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:27.280]   of control her stuff and we can get rid of toys
[00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.200]   and she doesn't know yet.
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.160]   Right.
[00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.320]   Yeah, so we are on the right side of that.
[00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.800]   So hopefully that'll be easy.
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.080]   Somebody once told me, watch out.
[00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.000]   You'll be losing keys.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.240]   You'll be bumping into furniture.
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.560]   You're more prone to accidents.
[00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.120]   It's one of those life changes that actually
[00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.000]   discombobulates your brain.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.400]   Yeah.
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.840]   And the weather change and the time zone change,
[00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.840]   I'm going to-- we're all going to be a little discombobulated
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:49.640]   for a while, I think.
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.320]   And I can't wait when Gina arrives back in January
[00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.760]   that she's going to have the thick accent back.
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.760]   Do you have a Brooklyn accent?
[00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:57.920]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:58.280]   What?
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.320]   It's really hard to get rid of it.
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.840]   I did.
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.480]   I worked really hard to get rid of it.
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:02.000]   Oh, well, you--
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.560]   You come on.
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:03.840]   You have to hear it sometimes.
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:04.440]   It comes out.
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.440]   No, I've never heard it.
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:06.800]   I want to hear it now.
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.000]   When I say ball.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.400]   Ball water.
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.320]   Oh, no, you didn't.
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.080]   You know, finalist for a slice.
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.280]   You're going to talk like Rosie Perez from now on?
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.600]   I didn't quite have it that bad.
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.920]   Oh, that would be really great.
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.120]   I would love that.
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.280]   Yeah, my wife made me promise that we would like actively
[00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.080]   try not to not get the book in accent.
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.760]   I was like, look, you can't get it all.
[00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.200]   We're losing regionalisms.
[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.000]   It's one of the things that makes this country great.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.520]   It's one of the things that makes the world great.
[00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.480]   It's regionalisms.
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.480]   Unique geographic differences.
[00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.120]   I hate traveling is not nearly as fun as it used to be
[00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.280]   when you had to get the Harold Tribune three days later
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.400]   to get the baseball scores.
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.480]   Now everything you know, everything you see, it's not as the--
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:53.240]   There's a line between charming and a little bit like--
[00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:54.400]   And that's where you're from, huh?
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.160]   I don't know.
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:56.160]   There's something about it.
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.360]   You know who did it great?
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.560]   It was Scarlett Johansson and Don John.
[00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:01.520]   Yeah, she's pretty good.
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.440]   She had the-- I was surprised.
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.160]   I thought she must be from there.
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.160]   She was snapping.
[00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.800]   Snapping to come.
[00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:09.480]   That is Jeff Jarvis.
[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.440]   He also has eliminated his Patricia Jackson.
[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.560]   He used to talk like this.
[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.080]   I have no accent.
[00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.400]   I am the standard for how to speak English, but fast.
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.440]   He's Middle Atlantic.
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.120]   Now I'm the one with no accent.
[00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.120]   Oh, that's right.
[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.880]   We have that out.
[00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.760]   Kevin Marks has no accent at all.
[00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.960]   We're the ones who sound weird.
[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.640]   I have a theory that since singing all
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.680]   sounds like American accent, that that
[00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.320]   is the natural way to speak.
[00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:37.360]   Why is that?
[00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.920]   Why is that?
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.840]   Would you explain that, Kevin Marks, when the Beatles sing,
[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:40.640]   they sound American?
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:41.560]   What is that?
[00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.840]   On your-- you watch Eurovision and ABBA,
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.320]   except for a few slight weird glottal stops,
[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.880]   sounds like they're American.
[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.600]   Ah.
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.120]   It may be the stretch of the vowels.
[00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.120]   And that may be what it is.
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.620]   Yeah.
[00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:54.560]   You stretch the vowels.
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:54.560]   Yeah.
[00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.160]   That's very sloppy vowels.
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.120]   Yeah.
[00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.800]   And you have to do that to sing.
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.400]   You're singing in Germany.
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.800]   It's quite hard.
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.800]   We're a singly sign in Argentina.
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.800]   It's our sloppy vowels that make us so lovable.
[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.600]   So you have these sort of smooth out vowel sounds
[00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.560]   that are different in--
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:15.400]   well, in many American accents, but in most American accents,
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.480]   it's a bit of that, I think.
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:21.920]   But instead of saying, love me do, you know or I love you.
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.720]   But always be true.
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:27.920]   They didn't sound like that.
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:28.520]   They could have.
[00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.320]   I think in that case it was because they would--
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.120]   they'd listen to the American blues sing
[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.160]   and the American blues sound like.
[00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:34.120]   I'm not very sure that was--
[00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:34.800]   Oh, no.
[00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.560]   I don't think you could-- no one sounds like that.
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:38.480]   Yeah, yeah, they do.
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:41.840]   If you listen to Pink Floyd sing or you listen to the clash
[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.120]   sing, they sing in London accents.
[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:45.160]   A little bit more, yeah.
[00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:46.120]   So where are you, Kevin?
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.880]   It sounds like you're at a conference.
[00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.960]   I am at the Giga Home Roadmap Conference.
[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:51.640]   Oh, fun.
[00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.720]   Oh, you have a pointer center for the arts.
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.160]   So it may be a little bit echo-y,
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:58.640]   and there were some trombones playing earlier.
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:59.160]   So you make it--
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:05:59.800]   No, it's fine.
[00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.080]   In fact, you sound great.
[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.840]   I could tell you're at a conference.
[00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:04.200]   So what is Roadmap all about?
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:07.000]   Is it a look to the future?
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.920]   It's about what's interesting to home at the moment,
[00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:10.640]   which is usually a good signal.
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:11.160]   Absolutely.
[00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.080]   It's a bit of the old e-tech, where
[00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.640]   he was trying to find a bunch of things that are coming along.
[00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:17.760]   But the theme this year is very much
[00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:21.520]   about the intersection of technology and design.
[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:25.200]   And that's sort of poorly what's been discussed here.
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:29.320]   People talking about the different possibilities
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:32.040]   around that.
[00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:35.120]   Home Malek is the Yoda of Tech.
[00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:36.920]   And we love him dearly.
[00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:38.320]   Give him a hug for us.
[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:39.960]   He's just the greatest.
[00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:40.560]   E-tech.
[00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.680]   That's a blast from the past, man.
[00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:43.200]   E-tech.
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:43.520]   I was--
[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:44.320]   I'm a mess, E-tech.
[00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.520]   E-tech was all the better events.
[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.880]   So this-- that's the privilege of me.
[00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:54.040]   But the speakers he's had, he had Jack Dorsey and Jeff
[00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:59.880]   Veen and Eric Speicerman and Tony Fadel.
[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:04.160]   So a lot of people who have been working with design
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:05.760]   and engineering at the same time.
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:07.840]   So it's been quite interesting for that perspective
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:10.160]   on product design and thinking about it.
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:12.440]   I've got a bunch of notes up.
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.080]   There's so many big stories this week.
[00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:16.560]   This is a big week for Google between the Google barge.
[00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:19.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:22.520]   Helpouts, KitKat, and of course the Nexus 5.
[00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:23.400]   I don't know where to start.
[00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:26.560]   But since I have a Nexus 5 in my hot little hands,
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:26.960]   I thought--
[00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:28.080]   No, we got to start with it.
[00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.640]   This might be the good place to start.
[00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:30.600]   So I don't know.
[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:33.240]   Both Chad and I ordered ours-- and so does Kevin Marks,
[00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:36.360]   I see his-- ordered ours within an hour
[00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:39.880]   of the beginning of sales, which are about 11 AM Pacific
[00:07:39.880 --> 00:07:42.120]   on Halloween day, the 31st.
[00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:44.640]   Did your IFTTT recipe work?
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:45.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:47.240]   It did, except I should never have mentioned it,
[00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:49.600]   because a lot of people went on App.net to prank me.
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:52.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:53.160]   It's your moment.
[00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:53.880]   You're blowing up.
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:54.880]   Yeah.
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:56.840]   The other thing that I noticed-- and this is maybe something
[00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:59.960]   to remember for future reference-- it does it in clumps.
[00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:04.320]   And I don't know if that's the App.net API or IFTTT
[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:05.480]   if this then that.
[00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:06.360]   It's not DT-spoling.
[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:06.960]   Yeah.
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:07.460]   But it--
[00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:07.840]   It might be polling.
[00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:11.280]   Yeah, it was-- and the polling was not very regular.
[00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:14.040]   So this is probably not the ideal way to do it.
[00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:15.720]   As it turned out, I think somebody
[00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:17.840]   mentioned it on Twitter or Google+ or whatever.
[00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:19.360]   I knew it was going to be that day,
[00:08:19.360 --> 00:08:21.720]   and I was watching carefully.
[00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:26.440]   I bought a 16 gigabyte, because when I first went to the site,
[00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:27.960]   that's all it showed.
[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:30.000]   And then the chat room said, oh no,
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.640]   you just modify the URL to 32 gigabytes.
[00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:35.400]   You could change the black to white if you want,
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:36.680]   and you can get whatever kind you want.
[00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:39.440]   So I did that, and I got the 32, and I have a 16.
[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:42.280]   I think maybe we'll have a raffle or something of the 16.
[00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:44.600]   We'll figure out some way to give that away.
[00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:45.100]   Nice.
[00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:46.200]   Well hacking.
[00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:48.320]   So a couple of things about it.
[00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:50.120]   It's yes, Jeff and Gina.
[00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:52.080]   I know both of you are Nexus 4 lovers.
[00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:54.160]   It is everything that Nexus 4 was and better.
[00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:57.000]   It's 1080p now instead of 720p.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.160]   Very nice screen.
[00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:01.200]   Although, you know, I complained about the Nexus 4 screen.
[00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:02.360]   I felt it was a little washed out,
[00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:04.080]   and this screen feels a little bit washed out too.
[00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:05.840]   I've put a black wallpaper on it
[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:08.200]   to give it more contrast, and it's a little bit preferable
[00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:09.360]   to me.
[00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:11.800]   But one advantage it has, whatever they're
[00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:12.960]   doing with this screen, maybe they're
[00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:15.600]   turning the brightness up, is it's great in sunlight.
[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:17.000]   In fact, I've never seen a phone that
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.280]   looks better in bright sunlight.
[00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:20.000]   It's totally usable.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.320]   It's an IPS LCD screen.
[00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:23.440]   It could be that feature.
[00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:25.200]   Oh, and I just showed you another thing,
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.440]   because it's KitKat.
[00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:30.000]   It's our first look at what Android 4.0--
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:32.120]   I'm sorry, Android 4.4 does.
[00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:34.000]   And one of the first things you'll notice immediately
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.280]   is the home screens are done differently.
[00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:39.640]   When you slide to the left, you get Google Now.
[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:40.640]   Very nice.
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:42.240]   I'm going to turn the brightness down a little bit here,
[00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:43.640]   because it's over time.
[00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:46.840]   I kind of liked the swipe up.
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:48.640]   Swipe up is still there.
[00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:49.040]   Oh, it is.
[00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:50.040]   OK.
[00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:51.680]   By the way, notice this transparency.
[00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:54.560]   Google Now actually now goes behind the buttons.
[00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:56.760]   Surprised they don't do the full screen on that.
[00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:57.520]   But yeah, that's nice.
[00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:58.360]   The transparency is nice.
[00:09:58.360 --> 00:09:59.760]   Yeah, and I think we're going to see more of that.
[00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:01.920]   So the swipe up still works.
[00:10:01.920 --> 00:10:02.560]   You saw that.
[00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:06.480]   And then you can still swipe up and tap Google.
[00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:07.200]   But what it does is--
[00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:10.000]   Do the buttons stay there all the time, or do they disappear?
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.040]   They stay there all the time.
[00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:12.080]   Isn't that odd?
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:14.320]   But they're transparent.
[00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:16.480]   The other thing is it's always listening
[00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:18.960]   when the screen's unlocked.
[00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:21.560]   And you have to say, OK, Google.
[00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:23.000]   And it will work like that.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.800]   And by the way, notice the transparency behind it.
[00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:27.600]   I think you're going to see a lot more transparencies.
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:28.920]   Oh, look at the translation.
[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:29.880]   That's fast.
[00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:31.240]   Yeah.
[00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:31.880]   Yeah.
[00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:33.240]   This is good.
[00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:35.240]   I think they've done a very nice job.
[00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:36.400]   They have changed a few things.
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:39.000]   For instance, you can no longer add widgets
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:39.760]   through the app drawer.
[00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:41.720]   The app drawer is just an app drawer.
[00:10:41.720 --> 00:10:44.360]   There's no more of this widget tab.
[00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:46.800]   To get a widget, you have to have a free space somewhere
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:47.480]   on your screen.
[00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:48.000]   I don't.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:48.760]   Oh, man.
[00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:50.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.200]   You have a little bit of screens, I thought.
[00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:53.600]   You do.
[00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:56.440]   But OK, so the only way you can get to a new screen
[00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:58.160]   is to slide it over.
[00:10:58.160 --> 00:10:59.920]   Now I've made a new screen.
[00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:00.400]   There you go.
[00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:00.880]   How do you do that?
[00:11:00.880 --> 00:11:02.480]   And yeah, how do you do that?
[00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:03.240]   That is a good question.
[00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:06.120]   So this was not immediately obvious to me, either, Kevin.
[00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:07.400]   If you slide a widget or--
[00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:09.640]   if you put a-- so here's how-- I'll show you.
[00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:11.000]   Here's how you get to widgets or apps.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:12.920]   You press and hold on an empty spot.
[00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:15.320]   And now we have wallpapers, widgets.
[00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:16.800]   And here's an interesting thing.
[00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:20.400]   Settings for Google Now.
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:22.920]   I think this-- people have said Google Now is everywhere.
[00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:25.000]   And I think this is the case.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:31.600]   So any time you-- this is the view of the home screens.
[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:33.120]   So you can reorder the home screens,
[00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:35.240]   all except for that Google Now page, which is you can see,
[00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:37.000]   I can't get to and I can't reorder.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.320]   So I could take this and drag it around.
[00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:43.040]   If I've created a home screen--
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:45.360]   if I want a new home screen, I could just
[00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:47.840]   drag a widget or an app over to it.
[00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:48.360]   So--
[00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:49.800]   How do you get into that mode?
[00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:50.240]   This mode?
[00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:51.040]   Press and hold.
[00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:51.760]   And actually, you know what?
[00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:53.240]   It works on-- does it work on a widget?
[00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:54.280]   No, it doesn't.
[00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:56.200]   So press and hold, and now I can--
[00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:57.120]   this is how you do it, Kevin.
[00:11:57.120 --> 00:11:59.080]   You drag it over.
[00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:00.400]   And now I have more screens.
[00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:02.840]   And then if you press and hold to get the widget screen,
[00:12:02.840 --> 00:12:04.800]   you see I see all of the screens and I can rearrange it.
[00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:05.240]   Oh, I see.
[00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:05.740]   OK.
[00:12:05.740 --> 00:12:06.840]   So it creates a new screen when you check
[00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:07.340]   to the--
[00:12:07.340 --> 00:12:09.160]   Yeah, you have to actually ask for it.
[00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:10.160]   In effect, that's for a new screen
[00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:11.600]   by moving something there.
[00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:12.800]   That will work also with an app.
[00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:15.400]   So if you take an app and you drag it,
[00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:16.480]   you can put it on a new screen.
[00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:17.480]   Oh, and it moves the app the app
[00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:18.640]   out of the way of the widgets.
[00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:20.640]   Yeah.
[00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:23.000]   It's kind of cute.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:29.680]   Other changes, I think.
[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:32.240]   You'll see all of this-- oh, there's a big thing here
[00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:33.960]   that I think is actually a mistake.
[00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:36.040]   There's two things that are really big changes.
[00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:38.840]   One is you see here, Hangouts is the new messages.
[00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:39.920]   You still have a message.
[00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:43.360]   You still have a messaging app for text messages.
[00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:44.640]   It's still there.
[00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:45.440]   But don't use it.
[00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:48.120]   There's no reason to use it because Hangouts now does it all.
[00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:50.560]   So we had heard that Hangouts will allow text messaging.
[00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:50.920]   It does.
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:53.720]   All the text messages go in there, Google Voice messages,
[00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:55.000]   and Hangouts messages.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.360]   So it's an all-in-one messenger.
[00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:57.360]   By default.
[00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:57.920]   I didn't know if you were--
[00:12:57.920 --> 00:12:59.920]   OK, so you didn't have to go in and say you used Hangouts.
[00:12:59.920 --> 00:12:59.920]   But the--
[00:12:59.920 --> 00:13:02.680]   In fact, this was how it was configured with it
[00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:05.440]   already in the doc.
[00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:11.840]   But you do still have, I believe, a message, maybe not.
[00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:12.360]   I don't see it.
[00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:14.080]   I saw the dialer, but I didn't see--
[00:13:14.080 --> 00:13:14.800]   Nope.
[00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:15.720]   That's another big change.
[00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:17.240]   The dialer is very different.
[00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:18.240]   And I think a big improvement--
[00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:20.040]   I make sure I don't want to show any phone numbers here.
[00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:21.280]   No phone numbers.
[00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:22.960]   It's very different.
[00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:24.880]   The search will now search not only everything
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:27.600]   in your contact list, but also searches Google Places.
[00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:30.440]   And also, caller ID comes from Google Places.
[00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:32.440]   So if somebody calls me from an 800 number,
[00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:33.840]   even if they're not my contact list,
[00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:36.720]   there may be information about them from Google Places,
[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:39.360]   which is kind of cool.
[00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:41.840]   The phone number dialer does no longer now,
[00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:42.840]   takes up the whole screen.
[00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:47.240]   It just slides up the contact list.
[00:13:47.240 --> 00:13:48.040]   I have to be careful here.
[00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:50.120]   And if you're in an SMS, then you
[00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:52.000]   get a little telephone icon there,
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:54.720]   instead of the Hangouts icon.
[00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:57.480]   It'll make a Google Voice Phone call.
[00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:58.440]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:13:58.440 --> 00:13:59.360]   See, I don't want to show any--
[00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:01.080]   I don't know if it'll make a Google Voice Phone call
[00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:03.400]   or a full maker.
[00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:05.600]   So here I'm in an SMS, and actually, this is a voice number,
[00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:08.360]   because somebody sent me a text via voice,
[00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:10.000]   so this is not a real number.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:12.320]   But I can call.
[00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:14.560]   I can add to people.
[00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:16.800]   This is all within Hangouts.
[00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:17.280]   Yeah.
[00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:19.720]   I got to be careful, because I don't want to show any--
[00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:25.800]   Well, you see when it's a Google Hangout ID,
[00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:27.640]   you see the name of the little video camera.
[00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:31.400]   And when it's an SMS, you see the name of the phone icon.
[00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:33.800]   Yeah, or actually says SMS.
[00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:37.280]   The chat room says, hold down the screen indicator area
[00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:38.360]   to get to--
[00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:42.800]   OK, so if I've run out of room, yeah, that works also.
[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:44.280]   So I was complaining, because I didn't
[00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:46.080]   have any empty space on the screen.
[00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:47.560]   You can also hold these little dots,
[00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:48.920]   the screen indicator.
[00:14:48.920 --> 00:14:50.880]   That's considered an empty space.
[00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:51.800]   So you can get there as well.
[00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:52.800]   Nice.
[00:14:52.800 --> 00:14:53.360]   Oh, I see.
[00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:53.720]   OK.
[00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:58.120]   One thing that's a little odd is there are two gallery apps now.
[00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:01.440]   There's the traditional AOSP kind of gallery app,
[00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:03.040]   and there's a Photos app.
[00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:06.720]   And this really is an interface to Google+ photos.
[00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:09.600]   But this is how you get all the new features of the Auto
[00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:12.520]   Awesome, the video editing, and all that stuff.
[00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:13.840]   So this is really--
[00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:17.560]   they've extracted out of Google+ the app just the photo
[00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:19.160]   page, basically.
[00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:21.040]   So those photos are on your phone,
[00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:22.680]   or those are in the cloud?
[00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:25.040]   Uh, cloud.
[00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:26.320]   I even know.
[00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:26.840]   No, no.
[00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:28.280]   It's on the line.
[00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:28.920]   Yeah.
[00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:30.520]   So they give you both.
[00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:32.240]   See, so there's camera.
[00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:33.200]   There's camera on the app.
[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:37.600]   If you look at it, Chad, if there's camera,
[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:38.600]   and then there's highlights.
[00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:41.320]   So that's Google+ and that's camera.
[00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:43.400]   Because there's sometimes a delay between the time
[00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:44.760]   you take the photos and they get uploaded.
[00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:45.880]   That's right.
[00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:46.560]   Yeah.
[00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:47.120]   This auto--
[00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:48.280]   It's also a 2G.
[00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:50.080]   The backup settings are in here now,
[00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:53.160]   and it does allow you to do full size.
[00:15:53.160 --> 00:15:57.560]   This is all stuff that they added to Google+.
[00:15:57.560 --> 00:15:59.640]   But I think that's a nice interface, frankly,
[00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:00.920]   to Google+ photos.
[00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:02.680]   But you might be a little confused.
[00:16:02.680 --> 00:16:04.080]   You still have a gallery.
[00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:09.520]   Your gallery works as before, but there's also this photo app.
[00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:12.880]   I think any other features I should mention--
[00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:15.640]   Is there a new photo editor?
[00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:16.560]   Not that I noticed.
[00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:17.880]   Maybe photos--
[00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:18.640]   let's-- let me look.
[00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:19.840]   Let's look.
[00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:20.800]   It's in the gallery now.
[00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:21.800]   Yeah.
[00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:23.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:25.880]   OK, Jason Howell, host of all about Android, is saying--
[00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:26.800]   It's Jason.
[00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:27.640]   It's in the gallery.
[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:29.640]   So let's take a picture.
[00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:33.800]   And then I can-- oh, yeah, here's the little pencil icon.
[00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:35.680]   And I can edit this.
[00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:39.760]   And I've got punch, vintage, all of the new editing stuff.
[00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:40.840]   This is a lot like Snapstream.
[00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:43.080]   I've got frames.
[00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:47.680]   I've got crops, including crops straight and rotate and mirror.
[00:16:47.680 --> 00:16:49.240]   That's nice.
[00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:50.200]   This is going to be fun.
[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:52.200]   Ooh.
[00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:53.960]   Overlies you can do in photos now.
[00:16:53.960 --> 00:16:57.760]   Yeah, auto-color, which is not very accurate.
[00:16:57.760 --> 00:16:59.760]   Exposures, you can change the exposure.
[00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:00.880]   This is nice.
[00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:02.720]   You may not need Snapstream anymore.
[00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:04.600]   You've got a lot of the features of Snapstream built in,
[00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:05.440]   which is, of course--
[00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:05.960]   Snapseed.
[00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:07.080]   Snapseed, I'm sorry.
[00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:08.080]   Which is, I'm sure--
[00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:11.760]   I get what you want to edit this with, link.
[00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:13.560]   Like I said, on the photo the first time.
[00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:16.160]   Ah.
[00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:17.880]   So the interesting is showing the original gallery
[00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:19.320]   and saying photo editor.
[00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:21.480]   Well, it doesn't say the ones are always.
[00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:24.080]   It didn't ask me.
[00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:24.920]   Huh.
[00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:25.840]   Yeah, that must be--
[00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:28.520]   I've got a lot of these features, not quite all of them.
[00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:30.720]   It must have been sort of an incremental update
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:33.640]   to the editor, because there is an editor in gallery right now.
[00:17:33.640 --> 00:17:35.600]   What are you on an Nexus 4?
[00:17:35.600 --> 00:17:37.080]   I'm on an HC1, the one.
[00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:39.800]   HC1, and you got 4/4.
[00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:40.640]   No, not yet.
[00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:41.280]   I don't have--
[00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:42.120]   OK.
[00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:43.400]   So that's the other thing.
[00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:45.920]   Some apps are being updated independently of 4.
[00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:47.760]   I'm seeing different things in the different ones.
[00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:48.560]   Yeah.
[00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:50.600]   So in the photo editor, in the gallery,
[00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:53.200]   I get the punch and the vintage and the--
[00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:54.320]   we want to be Instagram thing.
[00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:59.160]   But if I click on it and do the photos one,
[00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:03.560]   I get a different subset of options.
[00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:05.160]   That's not going to work, whatever you're doing.
[00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:07.720]   The different name.
[00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:10.440]   Holding it up to the camera.
[00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:12.640]   There's a unified file picker.
[00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:14.120]   Have you checked this out, Leo?
[00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:15.440]   Where would I get to that?
[00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:16.040]   So I don't know.
[00:18:16.040 --> 00:18:17.960]   In any app where you're opening a file,
[00:18:17.960 --> 00:18:20.680]   maybe an email can send someone a file?
[00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:22.080]   OK, let's try that.
[00:18:22.080 --> 00:18:23.680]   Let's go to Gmail.
[00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:24.440]   And I want to--
[00:18:24.440 --> 00:18:25.640]   Oh, Gmail would work.
[00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:26.880]   --attach.
[00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:28.640]   Let's do a new image.
[00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:32.360]   And I want to attach something.
[00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:35.800]   Attach picture, attach video.
[00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:36.960]   So this is the picture.
[00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:37.840]   Yeah, I like this.
[00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:40.080]   This looks more like the--
[00:18:40.080 --> 00:18:41.600]   and then you also have--
[00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:43.520]   and this is a big deal.
[00:18:43.520 --> 00:18:46.200]   Not only do I have access to drive through this,
[00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:48.080]   but also whatever you've attached.
[00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:51.080]   So in this case, Dropbox, Astro File Manager, Photos,
[00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:54.160]   Gallery, downloads images drive in recent.
[00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:55.680]   So that is nice.
[00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:57.920]   Oh, so you've connected your Dropbox account to your--
[00:18:57.920 --> 00:18:59.840]   I had connected it before.
[00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:02.320]   And so it now sees that in the picker.
[00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:03.760]   That's really nice.
[00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:05.160]   Really nice.
[00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:05.680]   Oh.
[00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:09.160]   So I can open directly from Dropbox.
[00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:10.200]   As well as Google Drive.
[00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:12.320]   Yeah, that's apparently a unified file picker.
[00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:15.200]   Any dev making any app that involves opening a file
[00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:19.480]   can just evoke that and doesn't have to worry about writing
[00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:22.080]   any of that custom code, but also gets access to all
[00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:25.520]   whatever cloud sources you've enabled, which is really nice.
[00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:28.000]   So Glad to see it's not just Google Drive
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:30.520]   that you can connect other apps like Box or Dropbox.
[00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:32.240]   Yeah, if I don't have a box account,
[00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:34.240]   so I would guess Box and all the other things.
[00:19:34.240 --> 00:19:36.000]   It's the traditional share thing.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:37.960]   As you add those apps, they get added to the--
[00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:39.680]   Well, iCloud probably doesn't work.
[00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:40.640]   I bet SkyDrive.
[00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:42.800]   I wonder if SkyDrive is a good one.
[00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:45.360]   I should go ahead and see.
[00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:47.920]   Now, a lot of us are going to get 4.4.
[00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:49.760]   The list of phones that are getting 4.4
[00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:51.960]   is getting longer and longer.
[00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:54.200]   And one of them is Moto X. Now, I think
[00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:57.200]   4.4 is really worth getting.
[00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:59.160]   But when I compare this phone to Moto X,
[00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:01.600]   I have to say that I'm probably going to still carry the Moto
[00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:03.120]   X day to day.
[00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:07.400]   So advantages are that the Nexus 5 definitely
[00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:08.640]   has a better screen.
[00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:11.120]   Bigger screen is 5 inches compared to 4.7.
[00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:16.600]   But it's also 1080p compared to 720.
[00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:19.520]   Which is actually amazing to look at on 1080p on this, yeah.
[00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:21.480]   It's beautiful.
[00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:24.400]   But I like many of the features that the Moto X has.
[00:20:24.400 --> 00:20:28.400]   I like the trusted Bluetooth that unlocks it automatically.
[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:29.840]   I like the Motorola skip feature.
[00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:32.080]   I like the shake to take a picture feature.
[00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:36.760]   I like the Motorola Assist is an amazing feature.
[00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:39.120]   Right now, for instance-- and I said this before,
[00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:39.960]   and I got in trouble--
[00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:42.920]   nobody can call me because I'm in a meeting, right?
[00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:46.280]   Unless they're in a trusted person.
[00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:47.880]   Those things work really well for me.
[00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:49.840]   There's a sense is when you're in a car,
[00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:51.680]   when you're in a meeting, when you're asleep.
[00:20:51.680 --> 00:20:53.320]   The do not disturb feature is great.
[00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:56.680]   I don't get bothered at night anymore, which is really great.
[00:20:56.680 --> 00:21:00.280]   And these are all features that Motorola added.
[00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:03.160]   And Motorola says the Moto X is going to get 4.4 like soon.
[00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:06.440]   They're going to skip right over 4.3.
[00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:09.480]   On the other hand, the camera, I think, in the Nexus 5 is better.
[00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:10.680]   Like, I'll show you.
[00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:12.840]   There was a software issue on the Moto X.
[00:21:12.840 --> 00:21:15.120]   They updated the Moto X camera.
[00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:15.960]   I don't know.
[00:21:15.960 --> 00:21:16.880]   They're not very good.
[00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:18.400]   And somebody was probably like, this is fine.
[00:21:18.400 --> 00:21:20.200]   The camera wasn't great.
[00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:23.680]   The Verge really seemed to have a heart on for the Nexus 5.
[00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:26.080]   And I don't know why.
[00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:29.040]   I don't think I agree with many of the things that they said.
[00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:30.160]   They were really nasty about it.
[00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:31.200]   Yeah, there was a lot of question marks.
[00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:32.960]   Yeah, the ultimate Google phone, question mark.
[00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:36.680]   But it seems like Josh took most issue with the camera.
[00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:37.720]   Well, let me show you.
[00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:40.960]   It's a fixable with software.
[00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:41.480]   Softland.
[00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:42.840]   And he said that in good light, it
[00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:45.160]   takes pictures that are really good,
[00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:47.720]   but in some lesser conditions.
[00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:49.120]   Well, I'll show you a good light picture,
[00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:49.960]   and I'll show you a bad light.
[00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:52.120]   It does have optical image stabilization, right?
[00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:53.880]   So I think that makes a big difference.
[00:21:53.880 --> 00:21:56.320]   It also is slow.
[00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:59.640]   And I think that's the biggest complaint I have.
[00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:01.960]   Moto X is much quicker to get the picture.
[00:22:01.960 --> 00:22:04.000]   On the other hand, when you get the picture, I think--
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.360]   this is an HDR picture.
[00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:07.760]   The crispness, the detail is excellent.
[00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:09.800]   This is low light, relatively low light.
[00:22:09.800 --> 00:22:12.720]   This is even lower light, because while I'm on a set that's
[00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:15.160]   lit, chat is not lit right now.
[00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:19.240]   And I think the low light performance is excellent here.
[00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:20.240]   Colors.
[00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:21.000]   Very good.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:23.440]   The detail is very good.
[00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:24.920]   Some of its HDR, some of its not.
[00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:26.000]   And I wish I don't remember.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.240]   Maybe-- oh, you know where it'd be in the details.
[00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:30.400]   Let me go back here and see if it marks that.
[00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:37.800]   Doesn't say-- I guess it doesn't say--
[00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:41.160]   it does say the F stop, the exposure.
[00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:42.720]   But it doesn't look like it says--
[00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:48.400]   I think this is an-- I think I'm very happy with the results
[00:22:48.400 --> 00:22:49.640]   of this camera.
[00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:51.720]   I think it does a very, very nice job.
[00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:53.800]   And I think that color is very accurate.
[00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:56.120]   I think this rivals the iPhone 5, frankly.
[00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:57.600]   Yeah, I guess.
[00:22:57.600 --> 00:23:01.920]   All right, so it's the Motorola features of--
[00:23:01.920 --> 00:23:04.400]   it's the Motorola add-ons purely.
[00:23:04.400 --> 00:23:08.840]   And you'll sacrifice screen size and quality
[00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:10.240]   with some caveats.
[00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:13.280]   I feel it's a little washed out compared to the Moto X.
[00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:18.800]   And camera quality for cameras--
[00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:19.840]   that's on the Nexus 5.
[00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:21.360]   It beats them on that respect.
[00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:23.200]   But on the Moto X, camera speed is--
[00:23:23.200 --> 00:23:26.160]   I can get to a picture so much faster on the Moto X.
[00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:28.680]   I could just tap and I've got a picture.
[00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:29.600]   It's just very quick.
[00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:33.160]   But the pictures are not as satisfying.
[00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:34.920]   They're not bad.
[00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:37.280]   But I think that--
[00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:39.120]   and it is the difference between the IPS screen
[00:23:39.120 --> 00:23:40.240]   and ML ed screen exactly.
[00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:45.280]   So as I do prefer the ML ed color and the contrast,
[00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:47.400]   you'll like the Moto X better.
[00:23:47.400 --> 00:23:49.520]   And they're both wireless charging or no?
[00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:52.480]   No, Moto X does not have wireless charging.
[00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:54.800]   What's a battery life like?
[00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:57.080]   Moto X, I think, beats it pretty handily.
[00:23:57.080 --> 00:24:01.000]   The Moto X has this advantage of this X processor,
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.880]   this external processor, whatever they call it, the X8,
[00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:08.800]   that he's on listening for talking.
[00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:10.720]   The other thing about the Moto X, you can talk to it
[00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:12.200]   at any time.
[00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:12.840]   It's touchless.
[00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:14.040]   You don't have to be--
[00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:18.520]   This has touchless, but the phone has to be awake, right?
[00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:21.160]   And I think that the Moto X is getting better battery life
[00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:22.920]   than the Nexus 5.
[00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:23.760]   Nexus 5 is not bad.
[00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:25.960]   It's maybe 12 hours.
[00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:28.840]   And the price difference now for the unlocked--
[00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:30.720]   That's a big difference.
[00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:33.360]   Moto X is almost twice as much.
[00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:33.800]   Yeah.
[00:24:33.800 --> 00:24:34.960]   That's a big difference.
[00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:37.800]   And in many ways, that's the headline on the Nexus 5.
[00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:41.880]   It's $350 for 16 gigs, 400 bucks, 400 gigs.
[00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:42.960]   The Moto X has wireless.
[00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:43.600]   Oh, I didn't know that.
[00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:46.160]   I wasn't able to do it, but maybe I haven't been.
[00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:47.560]   I thought it did not have wireless.
[00:24:47.560 --> 00:24:51.720]   I don't like wireless charging.
[00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:53.680]   I have a lot of Qi chargers all around the house.
[00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:55.320]   And you have to position it just right.
[00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:57.120]   This apparently now has magnets in it,
[00:24:57.120 --> 00:24:59.440]   and they have a new Nexus 5 charger.
[00:24:59.440 --> 00:25:01.120]   And if the magnets help position it,
[00:25:01.120 --> 00:25:03.680]   then that'll make a difference.
[00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:05.640]   Yeah, it doesn't seem like something that--
[00:25:05.640 --> 00:25:08.380]   I can't tell if it's the people don't talk about wireless
[00:25:08.380 --> 00:25:08.960]   charging very much.
[00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:09.600]   I don't have it.
[00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:10.800]   I've never had any of my devices.
[00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:12.520]   But my fantasy is that someday I'm just
[00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:14.360]   going to take my phone and lay it down somewhere that'll just
[00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:14.840]   work.
[00:25:14.840 --> 00:25:19.480]   But does it not just work in its current iteration?
[00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:22.920]   That's the thing.
[00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:24.640]   You got to position the phone correctly.
[00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:25.200]   You do.
[00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:26.400]   It's just a test.
[00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:29.280]   I bought because I have my Nexus 4 in my Nexus 7.
[00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:30.120]   I thought, oh, it's great.
[00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:31.280]   I have wireless chargers.
[00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:32.840]   I have Anker.
[00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:34.600]   I have the Google wireless charger.
[00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:36.800]   And I have an energizer wireless charger.
[00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:39.440]   And at least with an Nexus 4 and an Nexus 7,
[00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:41.480]   getting it into exactly the right position is tricky.
[00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:43.160]   You have to look at the light to see if it's charging.
[00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:44.920]   If it gets knocked loose, it's not going to charge.
[00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:46.280]   Takes a long time to charge.
[00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:47.960]   It's not an efficient way to charge.
[00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:50.440]   It ended up just plugging it in, because then I know it's in.
[00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:52.280]   I know it's in its charging.
[00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:54.640]   And it's charging at the maximum speed.
[00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:55.360]   That's not good enough.
[00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:58.200]   It's got to be the wireless charging to be really worth it.
[00:25:58.200 --> 00:25:59.560]   It has to be super easy.
[00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:00.640]   It was a little disappointing.
[00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:02.200]   Moto X does not have wireless charging.
[00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:04.800]   I don't know why somebody in our chat room said that.
[00:26:04.800 --> 00:26:09.600]   But I don't think wireless is really
[00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:12.720]   a great form of charging.
[00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:13.560]   I'm not getting--
[00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:15.120]   I haven't gotten it yet, but I'm not getting
[00:26:15.120 --> 00:26:17.880]   buyers from Morrison's and going for the Nexus 5 over the--
[00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:18.380]   Good.
[00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:19.480]   No, I think you like the Nexus-- look,
[00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:21.520]   anybody who loved the Nexus 4, which you did,
[00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:23.480]   is going to say this is the Nexus 4,
[00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:26.400]   and it's even better, no glass back, nice soft touch back.
[00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:28.720]   It's much less fragile.
[00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:29.680]   I feel it in the hand.
[00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:31.840]   Feels good in the hands a little big compared to--
[00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:34.400]   one thing I said, because I think the Moto X is not
[00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:36.160]   getting much love, and it deserves it.
[00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:37.280]   Because I think in many ways, this
[00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:39.240]   would be the most satisfying phone for most people.
[00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:40.600]   This is a better size for the hand.
[00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:44.040]   It's just a little bit smaller.
[00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:46.320]   On the other hand, I took both out in a bright sunlight,
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:49.680]   and the Nexus 5 is easily the best in bright sunlight.
[00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:52.200]   In fact, I've never seen a phone that's this good in bright
[00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:53.200]   sunlight.
[00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:55.480]   It's really great.
[00:26:55.480 --> 00:26:57.880]   I've got one here.
[00:26:57.880 --> 00:26:59.280]   What's that?
[00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:02.240]   This is one that Nicholas Chabon here showed me, which is--
[00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:03.680]   Oh.
[00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:05.600]   --an eating screen phone.
[00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:09.400]   He brought that to Twitter on Sunday.
[00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:10.360]   It's very slow.
[00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:12.680]   It's using the same screen technologies in the Kindle,
[00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:14.960]   but at least it looks good in bright light, yeah.
[00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:17.080]   Yeah, no, this is quite--
[00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:21.760]   and he's also-- do you already see the Android iPhone?
[00:27:21.760 --> 00:27:22.760]   Yeah.
[00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:24.440]   I guess he had more than one.
[00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:29.680]   I bought from him the Android iPhone, the Android Lumia 1020,
[00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:32.520]   and the Note 3, the fake Note 3.
[00:27:32.520 --> 00:27:33.600]   Whoa.
[00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:36.160]   He must have had more in his little peddlers pack.
[00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:38.200]   Yes, he's on an unholy marriage.
[00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:40.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:43.520]   Well, it's even weird than that, because half the apps
[00:27:43.520 --> 00:27:44.440]   are actual--
[00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:45.560]   like, they look like the--
[00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:46.080]   They look--
[00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:48.880]   The clock app is indistinguishable.
[00:27:48.880 --> 00:27:51.000]   Yeah, the phone app looks like--
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:52.200]   Yeah, that's horrible.
[00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:54.680]   I don't know what that is.
[00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:59.120]   But the-- if you click on Maps, go straight to Google Maps.
[00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:01.560]   But the weather one is like a complete--
[00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:02.720]   It's an Apple one.
[00:28:02.720 --> 00:28:03.720]   Yeah.
[00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:05.280]   Look at the clock app.
[00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:06.720]   It's exactly the same.
[00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:09.240]   And this is Android.
[00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:11.080]   This company spent a lot of energy
[00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:14.320]   in making this indistinguishable from an iPhone,
[00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:16.200]   except it's clearly distinguishable.
[00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:17.480]   And I don't know if you saw this, Kevin.
[00:28:17.480 --> 00:28:20.520]   Yesterday, I got this weird boot cycle
[00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:22.600]   with a lot of Chinese characters going.
[00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:25.240]   And I had to just guess what to hit.
[00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:27.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:28:27.560 --> 00:28:28.560]   It was all very strange.
[00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:29.440]   How much was it?
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:30.960]   $43.
[00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:31.960]   Wow.
[00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:32.840]   Yeah.
[00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:36.240]   But it's really clear what they're selling these for
[00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:38.200]   is not to fool the owner.
[00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:40.600]   The owner knows it's not Windows Phone.
[00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:41.320]   They don't even hide it.
[00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:42.800]   I mean, they don't say Windows Phone on it.
[00:28:42.800 --> 00:28:45.400]   This says something weird on a clot cut.
[00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:50.200]   But it's to fool your friends to think
[00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:53.920]   you have a prestigious high value phone, like an iPhone.
[00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:56.120]   This doesn't say Apple on it.
[00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:57.640]   You know?
[00:28:57.640 --> 00:28:59.320]   It says it's a digital audio player.
[00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:03.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:05.360]   It should say design in China assembled in China.
[00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:06.440]   That would be good.
[00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:07.240]   That would be really good.
[00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:08.240]   Yeah.
[00:29:08.240 --> 00:29:09.160]   There's the Nexus.
[00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:11.080]   It even has stitching.
[00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:13.000]   Well, it also says someone then they've changed the version
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:13.600]   string.
[00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:15.240]   So they look like they're running higher versions
[00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:16.240]   of Android than they are in things.
[00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:17.520]   Oh, I bet.
[00:29:17.520 --> 00:29:19.240]   This was a version string, even though it's
[00:29:19.240 --> 00:29:23.720]   Android settings, the version looks like it says iOS version 7.
[00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:25.000]   Yeah.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:26.080]   They have some good programmers.
[00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:29.760]   I mean, this is the iOS settings, you know, exactly.
[00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:30.280]   Yeah, it's good.
[00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:30.760]   It's good.
[00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:30.760]   It's good.
[00:29:30.760 --> 00:29:32.040]   The bounce and everything.
[00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:33.760]   Somebody spent some effort doing this.
[00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:38.480]   Anyway, isn't that fun?
[00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:41.000]   So how much did Dickless tell you that for?
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:41.520]   Oh, no.
[00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:43.040]   He just-- I saw him on the show.
[00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:44.360]   He said, oh, I'll leave him here.
[00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:44.800]   Oh, all right.
[00:29:44.800 --> 00:29:47.120]   Yeah, I bought him all.
[00:29:47.120 --> 00:29:48.640]   Chargebacks.
[00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:49.640]   I've got his full set here.
[00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:51.000]   My device has done that.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:51.600]   Oh, look at that.
[00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:52.560]   You do have the full set.
[00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:53.680]   Oh, wow.
[00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:55.640]   You got him all.
[00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:57.400]   You got him all.
[00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:59.320]   I guess he buys several because he's--
[00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:02.840]   I thought he was selling me his only copies, but I guess.
[00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:04.400]   Well, he goes back and forth every month,
[00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:05.880]   and this is the same people as I've made.
[00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:05.880]   Right.
[00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:07.800]   And Shenzhen, yeah.
[00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:08.320]   Pretty cool.
[00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:10.640]   Because there was a--
[00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:13.800]   Zanep Tufeki, who was grumbling on Medium--
[00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:15.040]   I don't know if you saw this--
[00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:17.680]   saying that she couldn't get a phone that was the right size
[00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:19.400]   for her hands because she's got small female hands,
[00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:21.320]   and all the Android friends are too big.
[00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:23.960]   So I think we need to put her together with drawbacks
[00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:26.280]   and say, OK, give him your specs,
[00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:30.640]   and he'll have someone manufacture Android effects.
[00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:33.000]   Hey, there is, I think, good news coming your way, Jeff.
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:35.480]   I saw you posted on Google+--
[00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:37.640]   Corning to--
[00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:38.760]   I wouldn't call it good news.
[00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:39.920]   Well, there's news.
[00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:41.920]   According to a fan droid, Verizon
[00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:45.960]   says it's Google and Asus' fault that it can't activate the Nexus
[00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:47.120]   7.
[00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:50.400]   These are systems issues with 4.3.
[00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:51.200]   I smell a rat.
[00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:52.280]   I'm looking for the tail.
[00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:53.640]   Yeah.
[00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:55.920]   Because they said there's some systems issues.
[00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:58.680]   So they said Google and Asus asked Verizon
[00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:00.160]   to suspend the certification process.
[00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:02.240]   The coolest thing I ever going to piss off Verizon.
[00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:04.320]   Well, good news is the reason I say it's good news
[00:31:04.320 --> 00:31:07.400]   is that 4.4 will be available on Nexus 7 soon,
[00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:08.840]   like this week or next.
[00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:09.240]   Well, who knows, but--
[00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:11.680]   Well, of course it will.
[00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:13.080]   Yeah, I filed--
[00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:16.120]   the funny thing was, this morning, I filed
[00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:19.840]   a continuing complaint with the FCC
[00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:22.360]   because they said that the certification was going to go four
[00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:23.920]   to six weeks started in August.
[00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:24.760]   Hey.
[00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:27.560]   That means somewhere between September 1 and mid-October,
[00:31:27.560 --> 00:31:28.440]   it should have been done.
[00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:30.920]   It's now into November.
[00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:33.280]   So I said enough FCC.
[00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:35.200]   And we'll see if this afternoon they come out with us.
[00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:36.960]   Then also yesterday, of course, they
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:39.400]   announced their own 7-inch tablet.
[00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:40.480]   Had I competitive?
[00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:42.520]   Oh, wow.
[00:31:42.520 --> 00:31:45.560]   Oh, smoking gun.
[00:31:45.560 --> 00:31:46.800]   Mm.
[00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:48.400]   They still haven't hooked it up.
[00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:50.160]   So I don't-- the thing is, Google
[00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:51.960]   is never going to piss off Verizon.
[00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:55.720]   Google has done the devil's deal with Verizon about neutrality.
[00:31:55.720 --> 00:32:01.440]   They just go to Google and say, hey, just ask us to wait this.
[00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:04.000]   And Google says, OK.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.040]   Yes, done Verizon.
[00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:10.400]   And so we'll never know what happened there unless the NSA
[00:32:10.400 --> 00:32:13.000]   has been listening.
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:15.480]   But now Verizon is hiding behind us.
[00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:17.440]   I still question the certification.
[00:32:17.440 --> 00:32:20.320]   I still say the FCC should get discovery
[00:32:20.320 --> 00:32:23.520]   on what was discovered in the certification.
[00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:26.200]   And because the certification alone
[00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:29.040]   makes a lie of the notion of open.
[00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:29.880]   Right.
[00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:33.360]   The phone meets standards that are set.
[00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:36.560]   Standards are what rule here, not certification.
[00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:41.640]   So what happens when you get the Google--
[00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:45.040]   the Motorola rather, a modular phone comes out.
[00:32:45.040 --> 00:32:47.480]   And some hacker makes a module for it.
[00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:50.800]   Is Verizon going to insist on certifying these things
[00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:52.680]   and going through thousands of dollars of that?
[00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:53.180]   No.
[00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:53.760]   Is it open network?
[00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:54.600]   Is it open network?
[00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:58.440]   Was it the famous landmark decision,
[00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:01.640]   the Carter phone decision, where
[00:33:01.640 --> 00:33:04.920]   mobbell was required to allow third party phones on the network.
[00:33:04.920 --> 00:33:06.920]   They used to say, you have to use Western--
[00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:11.480]   rent Western electric equipment from us
[00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:16.400]   because we have to have a reliable system.
[00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:20.480]   In 1968, the FCC said, nope.
[00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:22.840]   Carter phone, that was the specific device,
[00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:25.840]   can be connected to the AT&T network as long as they
[00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:28.720]   can be shown not to cause harm.
[00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:31.840]   So that's what opened up the network way back in '68.
[00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:32.680]   Exactly.
[00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:35.040]   So the same thing going on now, open is open is open.
[00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:37.000]   Now, there are some people who are complaining and saying
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:39.680]   that I should add the Nexus 5 because it doesn't work on Verizon
[00:33:39.680 --> 00:33:40.180]   to this.
[00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:42.640]   That's different for a couple of reasons.
[00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:48.280]   One is that the Nexus 5 depends on the CDMA networks
[00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:49.440]   of the frequencies.
[00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:51.160]   And those are not open.
[00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:52.480]   Those are, in fact, proprietary.
[00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:54.340]   The only thing that was open here that was made open
[00:33:54.340 --> 00:33:57.560]   was the 700 megahertz Black Sea spectrum
[00:33:57.560 --> 00:34:00.640]   because that was the condition of the sale of it to Verizon.
[00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:02.880]   So Verizon is still not acting openly,
[00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:04.280]   so I still call them on it.
[00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:09.160]   Well, another good piece of information
[00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:10.540]   you might be interested in is it looks
[00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:14.180]   like the Moto Maker site is going to come to Sprint
[00:34:14.180 --> 00:34:16.340]   in the next week or so.
[00:34:16.340 --> 00:34:20.540]   I hope Verizon and I hope T-Mobile.
[00:34:20.540 --> 00:34:24.780]   And I'm going to beg Kai Kawasaki to let me order a wooden backed
[00:34:24.780 --> 00:34:25.940]   phone.
[00:34:25.940 --> 00:34:29.140]   So if I can use Moto Maker on T-Mobile,
[00:34:29.140 --> 00:34:33.820]   I might have an extra Nexus 5.
[00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:36.380]   I just want a wooden phone.
[00:34:36.380 --> 00:34:38.180]   I like the Nexus 5, but ultimately you
[00:34:38.180 --> 00:34:39.220]   have to pick one phone, right?
[00:34:39.220 --> 00:34:41.400]   You can't-- it's not practical to carry around.
[00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:44.000]   Well, this is my problem.
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.100]   I only want to carry one phone.
[00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:46.700]   Did you see the picture?
[00:34:46.700 --> 00:34:49.860]   I should have said there was a picture.
[00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:50.940]   Sorry, Kevin.
[00:34:50.940 --> 00:34:52.740]   So a lot of people do carry too, because they have a work
[00:34:52.740 --> 00:34:53.740]   phone in there.
[00:34:53.740 --> 00:34:55.740]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:34:55.740 --> 00:34:58.080]   I just went to a conference of the Fans
[00:34:58.080 --> 00:34:59.860]   of the Fans of the Mancy Four Square Conference.
[00:34:59.860 --> 00:35:03.300]   It's called Not That Four Square, but for Ron Ritalisard.
[00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:05.460]   And it's off the record.
[00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:07.460]   But Sir Martin Sorel was on stage.
[00:35:07.460 --> 00:35:11.860]   And he was being ridiculed for having a blackberry.
[00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:12.860]   There was also a great picture.
[00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:16.140]   I should have saved-- I think it was in China of a bus
[00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:21.980]   with like 25 phones in the dash.
[00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:22.620]   Frightening.
[00:35:22.620 --> 00:35:23.940]   I think we'll actually drive that way.
[00:35:23.940 --> 00:35:25.340]   I think it was a joke.
[00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:27.260]   I hope it's a joke.
[00:35:27.260 --> 00:35:28.980]   It looks like something in the Leo car.
[00:35:28.980 --> 00:35:35.100]   My friend's called the booty phone and the duty phone.
[00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:36.500]   Booty and duty.
[00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:38.860]   We have a phone on the frozen phone.
[00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:39.860]   Which is which?
[00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:41.580]   Booty duty.
[00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:42.580]   Booty.
[00:35:42.580 --> 00:35:44.260]   I definitely feel like Sorel Goodman here
[00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:46.020]   at the moment with this set of things here.
[00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:47.820]   You got quite a few, yeah.
[00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:48.180]   That's right.
[00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:51.980]   He opens a drawer on Breaking Bad and pulls out a burner phone
[00:35:51.980 --> 00:35:53.260]   and says, here, use this.
[00:35:53.260 --> 00:35:55.580]   Hello, kitty phone?
[00:35:55.580 --> 00:35:56.460]   Hey, it's free.

[00:35:58.980 --> 00:36:00.020]   Also, the other slightly weird thing
[00:36:00.020 --> 00:36:03.700]   is that these bootleg phones have the actual Google Play Store
[00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:05.620]   on, which was which is surprising.
[00:36:05.620 --> 00:36:06.120]   I know.
[00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:07.700]   I thought that was very weird.
[00:36:07.700 --> 00:36:08.780]   Yeah.
[00:36:08.780 --> 00:36:11.340]   So maybe Google's just turning a blind eye
[00:36:11.340 --> 00:36:12.540]   because they want the market share.
[00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:14.700]   Like Microsoft used to do with power of versions of Windows.
[00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:18.620]   Or maybe they just haven't worked out how to enforce this yet.
[00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:20.380]   Yeah, I mean, just to be clear, they
[00:36:20.380 --> 00:36:22.180]   could use the open source version of Android
[00:36:22.180 --> 00:36:25.260]   without any interference and fork it as Amazon does.
[00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:29.860]   It's the apps that the Google apps that make it a violation.
[00:36:29.860 --> 00:36:33.620]   But they are running maps and they're running the Play Store
[00:36:33.620 --> 00:36:35.100]   and they're running the Core Apps.
[00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:37.940]   Maybe Google's saying, hey, what the heck?
[00:36:37.940 --> 00:36:40.940]   How could it be bad for them?
[00:36:40.940 --> 00:36:43.100]   Even the iPhone 1, if you click the Apple Maps,
[00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:43.860]   you get Google Maps.
[00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:44.340]   Right, I know.
[00:36:44.340 --> 00:36:47.380]   It's got the Apple Maps icon, though.
[00:36:47.380 --> 00:36:50.100]   Even with Highway 280 and everything.
[00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:52.580]   Whereas the store, they spawn something that looks very
[00:36:52.580 --> 00:36:53.460]   like the Apple App Store.
[00:36:53.460 --> 00:36:55.180]   But I'm not sure what happens when I try and install
[00:36:55.180 --> 00:36:57.180]   something from it.
[00:36:57.180 --> 00:37:00.580]   What size SIM do these things have?
[00:37:00.580 --> 00:37:00.980]   I don't know.
[00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:01.660]   Let me look.
[00:37:01.660 --> 00:37:03.100]   Which?
[00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:04.900]   It looks like big SIMs.
[00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:06.060]   That's the one I'm imagining.
[00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:07.100]   They don't need the micros.
[00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:07.600]   Yeah.
[00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:11.180]   Just to be clear, this is Android with an iOS-like skin.
[00:37:11.180 --> 00:37:13.820]   Yeah, these are all Android that are skinned and running
[00:37:13.820 --> 00:37:18.300]   on devices that look like other people's proprietary devices.
[00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:20.660]   And it's because they're too expensive in China.
[00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:24.740]   These are all 50 bucks or less.
[00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:26.940]   Well, there are a bit more if you want 3G rather than 2G
[00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:27.740]   and things like that.
[00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:31.540]   It's like a shopping list for what features you get.

[00:37:43.380 --> 00:37:44.380]   I don't think I do.
[00:37:44.380 --> 00:37:44.900]   Yeah.
[00:37:44.900 --> 00:37:46.140]   Well, because it doesn't exist yet.

[00:39:50.620 --> 00:39:51.620]   I will.
[00:39:51.620 --> 00:39:53.620]   They have to approve you now, though.
[00:39:53.620 --> 00:39:55.140]   Yeah, so here's what you do.
[00:39:55.140 --> 00:39:57.380]   You click the helpouts.google.com page
[00:39:57.380 --> 00:39:59.620]   and you say, I'd like to apply.

[00:40:08.380 --> 00:40:09.580]   Pick your price.
[00:40:09.580 --> 00:40:11.300]   Set your own rate for each help out
[00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:13.540]   and get paid easily using Google Wallet.
[00:40:13.540 --> 00:40:15.180]   Charge a fixed price per help out,
[00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:17.700]   or set a per minute rate.
[00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:18.780]   You set up your schedule.
[00:40:18.780 --> 00:40:22.220]   You decide when you're available.
[00:40:22.220 --> 00:40:25.860]   And then I guess you get in the directory.
[00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:29.180]   Now, there's a button here that says, give your own helpouts.
[00:40:29.180 --> 00:40:32.940]   Yeah, I guess you have to get vetted by Google.
[00:40:32.940 --> 00:40:35.060]   And then there was also-- there's a story on the rundown,
[00:40:35.060 --> 00:40:39.220]   next one down from GigaOM saying that for now, for health,
[00:40:39.220 --> 00:40:40.220]   they're not doing it.
[00:40:40.220 --> 00:40:42.780]   And this seems to indicate-- not doing a price.
[00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:43.900]   They're making them free for now.
[00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:44.700]   Health is free, so--
[00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:45.220]   Super price.
[00:40:45.220 --> 00:40:47.100]   Here's a couple pet wellness information,
[00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:48.740]   nutritional counseling.
[00:40:48.740 --> 00:40:49.900]   That's $65.
[00:40:49.900 --> 00:40:53.940]   There's insurance companies or medical plans or--
[00:40:53.940 --> 00:40:55.780]   This one's paid.
[00:40:55.780 --> 00:40:59.580]   I can get a nutrition counseling for $65.
[00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:00.740]   Pet stuff's free.
[00:41:00.740 --> 00:41:02.660]   Here's a help with your medical question.
[00:41:02.660 --> 00:41:04.300]   $60 per help out.
[00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:05.300]   $5 per minute.
[00:41:05.300 --> 00:41:06.500]   Dr. Rodney Saman.
[00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:10.780]   He's a prevented cardiologist in Los Angeles.
[00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:13.740]   Psycho therapy on call for $90.
[00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:14.620]   Jesus.
[00:41:14.620 --> 00:41:16.060]   Bill Zicca.
[00:41:16.060 --> 00:41:18.180]   Doesn't-- Dr. Bill, he calls himself.
[00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:19.580]   That's an interesting idea.
[00:41:19.580 --> 00:41:20.580]   Talk to his shrink.
[00:41:20.580 --> 00:41:21.780]   Well, it's an HBO show.
[00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:23.380]   It's what's her name.
[00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:25.340]   But what's nice about this is it's less expensive.
[00:41:25.340 --> 00:41:27.380]   He's got a PhD in psychology.
[00:41:27.380 --> 00:41:29.420]   He's a clinical psychologist licensed
[00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:30.740]   to practice in California.
[00:41:30.740 --> 00:41:34.820]   Now I wonder, do you have to call from California?
[00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:38.180]   24-hour notice required or fees apply for cancellation.
[00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:41.100]   So you set up an appointment next available time, 10 AM.
[00:41:41.100 --> 00:41:43.060]   It's just like a real therapist, really.
[00:41:43.060 --> 00:41:47.660]   $90 for 45 minutes, though, is maybe half.
[00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:51.780]   Or a little more than half what it would cost for a real therapist.
[00:41:51.780 --> 00:41:53.940]   And you know, I don't see any reason why a hangout wouldn't
[00:41:53.940 --> 00:41:57.060]   be every bit as good as sitting on a couch across from somebody.
[00:41:57.060 --> 00:41:58.700]   Yeah.
[00:41:58.700 --> 00:41:59.860]   Yeah.
[00:41:59.860 --> 00:42:02.860]   So the categories are home, art and music, computers
[00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:05.940]   and electronics, cooking, education and careers, fashion
[00:42:05.940 --> 00:42:09.860]   and beauty, fitness and nutrition, health and home and garden.
[00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:12.660]   I wouldn't mind-- let's see-- fashion, online personal styling.
[00:42:12.660 --> 00:42:15.660]   Sports coaching, I would have thought that would be obvious one.
[00:42:15.660 --> 00:42:17.060]   Which one?
[00:42:17.060 --> 00:42:17.940]   Sports coaching.
[00:42:17.940 --> 00:42:19.460]   It's like, OK, let me--
[00:42:19.460 --> 00:42:21.940]   It's a little hard to do it out in the field.
[00:42:21.940 --> 00:42:22.500]   But--
[00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:23.340]   They don't have that.
[00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:24.540]   I guess you could do a golf swing.
[00:42:24.540 --> 00:42:25.340]   The other thing was--
[00:42:25.340 --> 00:42:27.380]   You've got phones that have runs on these?
[00:42:27.380 --> 00:42:28.300]   Well, they've got fitness.
[00:42:28.300 --> 00:42:30.220]   Let's see if there's fitness.
[00:42:30.220 --> 00:42:33.580]   Marathon training, party proof, your weight loss
[00:42:33.580 --> 00:42:34.580]   from Weight Watchers.
[00:42:34.580 --> 00:42:36.660]   So there's some brands doing stuff here.
[00:42:36.660 --> 00:42:37.140]   Yeah.
[00:42:37.140 --> 00:42:38.260]   Oh, interesting.
[00:42:38.260 --> 00:42:41.020]   That's actually a good-- that makes sense for Weight Watchers.
[00:42:41.020 --> 00:42:41.780]   Here's some.
[00:42:41.780 --> 00:42:43.820]   You want to use kettlebells?
[00:42:43.820 --> 00:42:46.420]   $30 per help out at Buck 25 a minute.
[00:42:46.420 --> 00:42:47.820]   What the heck are kettlebells?
[00:42:47.820 --> 00:42:48.740]   What?
[00:42:48.740 --> 00:42:49.860]   Oh, come on.
[00:42:49.860 --> 00:42:52.140]   You don't know what kettlebells are?
[00:42:52.140 --> 00:42:52.900]   No.
[00:42:52.900 --> 00:42:56.140]   Basically, think of a giant cement weight.
[00:42:56.140 --> 00:42:58.460]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:42:58.460 --> 00:42:59.260]   It's a workout at it.
[00:42:59.260 --> 00:43:01.500]   Swung around.
[00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:02.380]   Yoga?
[00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:04.260]   I would be dangerous with that, whatever it does.
[00:43:04.260 --> 00:43:04.780]   Oh, yeah.
[00:43:04.780 --> 00:43:05.980]   Everybody is.
[00:43:05.980 --> 00:43:09.460]   Here's corrective exercises for posture and imbalance.
[00:43:09.460 --> 00:43:12.100]   It seems to involve large chains.
[00:43:12.100 --> 00:43:13.020]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:43:13.020 --> 00:43:13.860]   Oh.
[00:43:13.860 --> 00:43:15.180]   Kind of makes you hot at the same time.
[00:43:15.180 --> 00:43:16.980]   Yeah.
[00:43:16.980 --> 00:43:19.260]   This person is a certified personal trainer.
[00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:21.220]   Lots of awards.
[00:43:21.220 --> 00:43:24.580]   Oh, season premiere winner of NBC's American Gladiators.
[00:43:24.580 --> 00:43:26.740]   I'd like to be taught by a gladiator.
[00:43:26.740 --> 00:43:28.740]   $20, 15 minutes.
[00:43:28.740 --> 00:43:29.460]   She'll show you how to--
[00:43:29.460 --> 00:43:29.980]   Hi.
[00:43:29.980 --> 00:43:32.580]   I'm Melissa Trinidad with Optimal Health and Performance
[00:43:32.580 --> 00:43:33.340]   Training.
[00:43:33.340 --> 00:43:34.940]   And this Google help out?
[00:43:34.940 --> 00:43:36.780]   They've obviously been-- this just came out
[00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:38.300]   a couple of days ago and they've got a ton of stuff.
[00:43:38.300 --> 00:43:40.380]   So they've obviously been soliciting people, right?
[00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:40.740]   Yeah.
[00:43:40.740 --> 00:43:42.780]   They've seeded it with some good start--
[00:43:42.780 --> 00:43:44.020]   prenatal personal training.
[00:43:44.020 --> 00:43:45.500]   This is great.
[00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:46.620]   But Gina's right too.
[00:43:46.620 --> 00:43:49.740]   What's really interesting is that this is a spare cycle
[00:43:49.740 --> 00:43:51.140]   business too.
[00:43:51.140 --> 00:43:53.540]   Not for weight washers, but for just, oh, what the heck?
[00:43:53.540 --> 00:43:55.100]   I got nothing a little more and more.
[00:43:55.100 --> 00:43:56.740]   This is not like demand media.
[00:43:56.740 --> 00:44:00.180]   If you're a personal trainer, this is huge.
[00:44:00.180 --> 00:44:02.340]   A nutrition counselor, a psychotherapist,
[00:44:02.340 --> 00:44:04.540]   I think that's very interesting.
[00:44:04.540 --> 00:44:07.020]   Here's a guy $15 for an hour.
[00:44:07.020 --> 00:44:09.860]   He'll work with you on P90X.
[00:44:09.860 --> 00:44:10.540]   That's cheap.
[00:44:10.540 --> 00:44:12.300]   Do they have educational stuff?
[00:44:12.300 --> 00:44:13.420]   Yes.
[00:44:13.420 --> 00:44:15.620]   What would you like to learn, Kevin Marks?
[00:44:15.620 --> 00:44:17.020]   Why was thinking reading therapy?
[00:44:17.020 --> 00:44:20.100]   This is stuff my wife and sons do.
[00:44:20.100 --> 00:44:20.620]   Yes.
[00:44:20.620 --> 00:44:21.100]   Yes.
[00:44:21.100 --> 00:44:22.020]   But eventually you could do it over this
[00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:23.100]   if the thing is good enough.
[00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:25.060]   Here's Spanish tutoring.
[00:44:25.060 --> 00:44:26.860]   Here's physics tutoring tutoring.
[00:44:26.860 --> 00:44:28.740]   What a call for tutoring.
[00:44:28.740 --> 00:44:29.660]   Oh, tutoring.
[00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:30.300]   That's pretty good.
[00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:32.300]   Free resume evaluation.
[00:44:32.300 --> 00:44:35.220]   We're a ranking rating system on top of this.
[00:44:35.220 --> 00:44:37.020]   Who are the good tutors?
[00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:37.900]   That's what they need.
[00:44:37.900 --> 00:44:40.420]   They do need a karma system.
[00:44:40.420 --> 00:44:42.500]   Beginning and intermediate algebra tutoring.
[00:44:42.500 --> 00:44:43.700]   Oh, I'm going to have Abby do this.
[00:44:43.700 --> 00:44:45.060]   This is great.
[00:44:45.060 --> 00:44:48.020]   Chinese language, science and math,
[00:44:48.020 --> 00:44:51.980]   rock, computer, science, homework.
[00:44:51.980 --> 00:44:53.740]   Oh, Jake would love this too.
[00:44:53.740 --> 00:44:54.220]   Yeah.
[00:44:54.220 --> 00:44:56.220]   A college internship interview preparation.
[00:44:56.220 --> 00:44:58.820]   What about programming or technical?
[00:44:58.820 --> 00:45:00.820]   Well, it's getting started with the Dutch language.
[00:45:00.820 --> 00:45:05.780]   I'm sure there is understanding Shakespeare.
[00:45:05.780 --> 00:45:07.180]   Learn effectively, take better notes.
[00:45:07.180 --> 00:45:10.300]   I'm going to send a link to this to my kid in college.
[00:45:10.300 --> 00:45:11.900]   Yeah, I'm sort of thinking that.
[00:45:11.900 --> 00:45:13.100]   Fabulous.
[00:45:13.100 --> 00:45:15.660]   Here it is, Intro to Computer Science.
[00:45:15.660 --> 00:45:19.940]   This is-- or if you have a general programming question,
[00:45:19.940 --> 00:45:22.620]   this guy is a PhD student in Applied Algorithms
[00:45:22.620 --> 00:45:26.740]   and chemo informatics at the Colorado School of Mines.
[00:45:26.740 --> 00:45:30.380]   He's got a BS in Computer Science and Software Engineering
[00:45:30.380 --> 00:45:32.140]   and a minor in Mathematics.
[00:45:32.140 --> 00:45:34.420]   And they do have reviews.
[00:45:34.420 --> 00:45:35.420]   Oh, they do?
[00:45:35.420 --> 00:45:35.900]   Oh.
[00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:36.860]   Five-star reviews.
[00:45:36.860 --> 00:45:38.340]   This guy is amazing.
[00:45:38.340 --> 00:45:40.540]   Just had a few questions, and JK thoroughly explaining
[00:45:40.540 --> 00:45:42.100]   me answers would recommend him.
[00:45:42.100 --> 00:45:43.380]   This is great.
[00:45:43.380 --> 00:45:44.860]   Similar to app reviews.
[00:45:44.860 --> 00:45:48.140]   In fact, it's a big question in the place store.
[00:45:48.140 --> 00:45:50.380]   This is amazing.
[00:45:50.380 --> 00:45:53.580]   I'm loving this.
[00:45:53.580 --> 00:45:55.620]   And it's a whole mark of social--
[00:45:55.620 --> 00:45:57.780]   Why do you use this instead of just advertising
[00:45:57.780 --> 00:45:58.740]   the fact that you're available?
[00:45:58.740 --> 00:46:00.820]   That looks like this system's--
[00:46:00.820 --> 00:46:03.380]   like the 20% that you're paying Google as somebody who's
[00:46:03.380 --> 00:46:04.740]   off from hell about.
[00:46:04.740 --> 00:46:05.660]   It's for marketing.
[00:46:05.660 --> 00:46:06.740]   It's for scheduling.
[00:46:06.740 --> 00:46:07.740]   It's for reviews.
[00:46:07.740 --> 00:46:08.940]   It's for discovery.
[00:46:08.940 --> 00:46:09.420]   Payment.
[00:46:09.420 --> 00:46:10.620]   Yeah, this is really neat.
[00:46:10.620 --> 00:46:11.620]   They've got a front end.
[00:46:11.620 --> 00:46:13.220]   It's high, though, as far as I'm concerned.
[00:46:13.220 --> 00:46:15.140]   I think 20% is high.
[00:46:15.140 --> 00:46:16.500]   Look, Leo, if you were to do--
[00:46:16.500 --> 00:46:17.500]   Anybody else who thought--
[00:46:17.500 --> 00:46:18.500]   No, I want to take the crack out that.
[00:46:18.500 --> 00:46:19.020]   --the crack out that.
[00:46:19.020 --> 00:46:20.220]   It's not too bad.
[00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:21.900]   But you're right, if I'm doing it for $1,000
[00:46:21.900 --> 00:46:24.020]   and they get $200, that's not so good.
[00:46:24.020 --> 00:46:25.620]   But I still get $800.
[00:46:25.620 --> 00:46:28.820]   I'll charge $1,250, and then I'll get my money back.
[00:46:28.820 --> 00:46:30.940]   And if you have your own platform,
[00:46:30.940 --> 00:46:33.220]   you could-- somebody can Gmail you the $1,000
[00:46:33.220 --> 00:46:35.940]   through Wallet without Google taking a cut.
[00:46:35.940 --> 00:46:37.380]   So this is about discovery.
[00:46:37.380 --> 00:46:40.220]   And also, it's about the ratings, which ultimately
[00:46:40.220 --> 00:46:41.700]   is about the discovery.
[00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:45.100]   And it's about scheduling booking times, which
[00:46:45.100 --> 00:46:46.740]   looks like there's some UI here for that.
[00:46:46.740 --> 00:46:48.500]   Latin help?
[00:46:48.500 --> 00:46:50.380]   SAT prep.
[00:46:50.380 --> 00:46:51.540]   I think the market--
[00:46:51.540 --> 00:46:52.420]   let's drink Gino's.
[00:46:52.420 --> 00:46:53.740]   Don't forget this.
[00:46:53.740 --> 00:46:57.100]   Gee, I need to get some help with Photoshop.
[00:46:57.100 --> 00:46:59.180]   Where am I going to go to start?
[00:46:59.180 --> 00:46:59.940]   Google.
[00:46:59.940 --> 00:47:01.020]   I'm going to search Google.
[00:47:01.020 --> 00:47:02.780]   And so I'm going to find people who are--
[00:47:02.780 --> 00:47:03.300]   Wow.
[00:47:03.300 --> 00:47:05.180]   --can teach me in Google.
[00:47:05.180 --> 00:47:10.020]   So this is a search play across this new field.
[00:47:10.020 --> 00:47:11.580]   How do I--
[00:47:11.580 --> 00:47:12.700]   do yeah.
[00:47:12.700 --> 00:47:13.220]   Whoa.
[00:47:13.220 --> 00:47:17.660]   Clever.
[00:47:17.660 --> 00:47:18.700]   I'm going to take this one.
[00:47:18.700 --> 00:47:21.780]   Speaking confidently and dynamically without fear.
[00:47:21.780 --> 00:47:26.220]   I need this.
[00:47:26.220 --> 00:47:28.580]   How about taking the course on how to sneak a soup slurp?
[00:47:28.580 --> 00:47:29.580]   Shh.
[00:47:29.580 --> 00:47:33.860]   Yeah, I should-- eating on air.
[00:47:33.860 --> 00:47:35.860]   I could teach that course.
[00:47:35.860 --> 00:47:36.860]   All right.
[00:47:36.860 --> 00:47:37.660]   All right.
[00:47:37.660 --> 00:47:40.380]   Kevin, what would you teach?
[00:47:40.380 --> 00:47:43.100]   I can't wait for this, because I know this is going to be--
[00:47:43.100 --> 00:47:45.420]   Kevin could teach the most arcane things.
[00:47:45.420 --> 00:47:50.060]   Something you're like the world's leading expert.
[00:47:50.060 --> 00:47:51.100]   Ah, no.
[00:47:51.100 --> 00:47:52.460]   The thing is, I know.
[00:47:52.460 --> 00:47:55.300]   I'm a dillotante, so I remember all kinds of different things.
[00:47:55.300 --> 00:47:57.580]   I'm not sure what I actually sell here.
[00:47:57.580 --> 00:47:59.020]   It probably would be--
[00:47:59.020 --> 00:48:00.940]   oops.
[00:48:00.940 --> 00:48:02.900]   Web standards and software stuff, I was actually
[00:48:02.900 --> 00:48:03.900]   considering to make money on it.
[00:48:03.900 --> 00:48:04.660]   Maybe I should try that.
[00:48:04.660 --> 00:48:06.420]   I'll probably have to tidy up my office a bit,
[00:48:06.420 --> 00:48:07.500]   so then I have to go in the garden
[00:48:07.500 --> 00:48:08.660]   and each time the thing rings.
[00:48:08.660 --> 00:48:13.300]   Here's one for you, Gina, chocolate, everything you need to know.
[00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:17.100]   Oh, I think I know everything that I need to know about chocolate.
[00:48:17.100 --> 00:48:19.780]   But this is from the Saver Chocolate and Potisserie
[00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:23.740]   School, $23.88.
[00:48:23.740 --> 00:48:25.860]   If you love all things how to temper chocolate,
[00:48:25.860 --> 00:48:29.020]   this is for like making cooking chocolate.
[00:48:29.020 --> 00:48:29.980]   Here's the idea.
[00:48:29.980 --> 00:48:31.940]   That doesn't scale very well.
[00:48:31.940 --> 00:48:33.500]   Right, so you're paying $20.
[00:48:33.500 --> 00:48:37.500]   I wonder if they can also offer group classes.
[00:48:37.500 --> 00:48:41.060]   I have you at the same time, each paying $20.
[00:48:41.060 --> 00:48:44.060]   Right, that would make more sense for certain kinds of cheese
[00:48:44.060 --> 00:48:45.060]   swinging things as well.
[00:48:45.060 --> 00:48:46.060]   I love this.
[00:48:46.060 --> 00:48:48.380]   But for classes, you can do something like Khan Academy.
[00:48:48.380 --> 00:48:49.340]   It's the thing.
[00:48:49.340 --> 00:48:51.380]   If I'm trying to work with layers in Photoshop,
[00:48:51.380 --> 00:48:53.380]   or I really want to cut out the background behind something
[00:48:53.380 --> 00:48:54.740]   in an image, and I can't figure out how to do it,
[00:48:54.740 --> 00:48:57.540]   I'm going to go to google.com and be like, how do I black out
[00:48:57.540 --> 00:48:59.180]   everything in the background in Photoshop?
[00:48:59.180 --> 00:49:04.020]   If Google returns, hey, get Photoshop help by this expert,
[00:49:04.020 --> 00:49:06.340]   I'm going to want to do this help out and be like, listen,
[00:49:06.340 --> 00:49:06.980]   here's my screen.
[00:49:06.980 --> 00:49:07.940]   I'm sharing my screen.
[00:49:07.940 --> 00:49:09.620]   How do I do this thing I'm going to try to do?
[00:49:09.620 --> 00:49:12.500]   Like a very specific question.
[00:49:12.500 --> 00:49:15.380]   And that I would pay a premium for.
[00:49:15.380 --> 00:49:16.580]   Yeah, per minute.
[00:49:16.580 --> 00:49:18.820]   Here on the cooking section, there
[00:49:18.820 --> 00:49:21.420]   are people helping you with culinary crises.
[00:49:21.420 --> 00:49:23.060]   Everyone into a kitchen crisis?
[00:49:23.060 --> 00:49:25.980]   Are you wondering whether to sauté stir fry or sous vide?
[00:49:25.980 --> 00:49:28.900]   And then for $2 a minute, you can get somebody to go, yeah,
[00:49:28.900 --> 00:49:31.580]   well, I can see what the problem right here is.
[00:49:31.580 --> 00:49:33.620]   You're trying to cook with the--
[00:49:33.620 --> 00:49:34.300]   Call Domino.
[00:49:34.300 --> 00:49:35.220]   Tea kettle.
[00:49:35.220 --> 00:49:36.700]   All right.
[00:49:36.700 --> 00:49:37.700]   Dinner and Ninja.
[00:49:37.700 --> 00:49:38.140]   Just giving.
[00:49:38.140 --> 00:49:41.380]   It'll be a big day for the cooking help outers.
[00:49:41.380 --> 00:49:42.900]   I love the cooking stuff.
[00:49:42.900 --> 00:49:43.580]   Man.
[00:49:43.580 --> 00:49:45.220]   I hope this doesn't go the way of now.
[00:49:45.220 --> 00:49:48.620]   I really do hope that this gets good uptake.
[00:49:48.620 --> 00:49:50.300]   I think it could be huge.
[00:49:50.300 --> 00:49:53.340]   Computer repair consultant, computer problem help,
[00:49:53.340 --> 00:49:54.420]   Apple Macintosh.
[00:49:54.420 --> 00:49:57.180]   There's, of course, a lot of people in this category.
[00:49:57.180 --> 00:50:00.500]   Well, there's got to be a grandma help course, too, here.
[00:50:00.500 --> 00:50:03.100]   You can all pay for it, grandma.
[00:50:03.100 --> 00:50:03.940]   Just ask this guy.
[00:50:03.940 --> 00:50:04.700]   Well, here's one.
[00:50:04.700 --> 00:50:08.260]   Using Google Calendar, I think that's for grandma.
[00:50:08.260 --> 00:50:11.300]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:50:11.300 --> 00:50:12.980]   We laugh, but me and my--
[00:50:12.980 --> 00:50:13.500]   No.
[00:50:13.500 --> 00:50:16.100]   --were trying to share the company Google Calendar
[00:50:16.100 --> 00:50:17.380]   and get right rights to it.
[00:50:17.380 --> 00:50:20.220]   And it took us together, which two laptops.
[00:50:20.220 --> 00:50:21.300]   And this is what we do.
[00:50:21.300 --> 00:50:21.900]   Right.
[00:50:21.900 --> 00:50:24.260]   It took us 20 freaking minutes to figure out
[00:50:24.260 --> 00:50:26.420]   how to make the calendar writable by both of us
[00:50:26.420 --> 00:50:27.740]   and our personal accounts.
[00:50:27.740 --> 00:50:29.060]   Well, there you go.
[00:50:29.060 --> 00:50:31.060]   Sometimes you just run into a situation where you're like,
[00:50:31.060 --> 00:50:33.220]   how do you do this stupid thing?
[00:50:33.220 --> 00:50:36.420]   Someone can just tell you right there on the spot.
[00:50:36.420 --> 00:50:39.500]   But imagine the high school kid in the middle of Alaska,
[00:50:39.500 --> 00:50:41.260]   who knows a lot about computers and wants
[00:50:41.260 --> 00:50:42.260]   to make a little extra money.
[00:50:42.260 --> 00:50:44.900]   You can be a remote geek squad.
[00:50:44.900 --> 00:50:47.380]   How much-- I wonder how much help Google gives you
[00:50:47.380 --> 00:50:50.060]   on your presentation, on what the shot looks like,
[00:50:50.060 --> 00:50:53.100]   on how to do the screen sharing.
[00:50:53.100 --> 00:50:54.020]   Or are you expected--
[00:50:54.020 --> 00:50:55.220]   or are you just thrown into this?
[00:50:55.220 --> 00:50:58.420]   It would be really nice if Google had a team--
[00:50:58.420 --> 00:51:00.140]   and I bet they do know in Google--
[00:51:00.140 --> 00:51:04.020]   of people who work with you and say, OK, let's fix that shot.
[00:51:04.020 --> 00:51:05.740]   Let's get some lights in here.
[00:51:05.740 --> 00:51:07.900]   Make it work better.
[00:51:07.900 --> 00:51:10.780]   Because here's one confused by wires.
[00:51:10.780 --> 00:51:13.660]   I can help.
[00:51:13.660 --> 00:51:15.820]   Wanting to gain knowledge in your home theater, home security,
[00:51:15.820 --> 00:51:20.060]   landscape, lighting, and home automation, I'm the guy.
[00:51:20.060 --> 00:51:20.500]   I need to--
[00:51:20.500 --> 00:51:21.340]   Somebody pointed out to--
[00:51:21.340 --> 00:51:22.340]   Somebody pointed out to--
[00:51:22.340 --> 00:51:22.940]   --to my new house.
[00:51:22.940 --> 00:51:24.420]   I might dial up that guy.
[00:51:24.420 --> 00:51:26.620]   And I like that some of these are marked as available for live
[00:51:26.620 --> 00:51:27.260]   help now.
[00:51:27.260 --> 00:51:29.380]   So I guess I imagine you could just click on it
[00:51:29.380 --> 00:51:31.380]   and the person's going to be there versus scheduling something
[00:51:31.380 --> 00:51:33.660]   ahead of time.
[00:51:33.660 --> 00:51:35.460]   Well, so somebody mentioned that this--
[00:51:35.460 --> 00:51:37.420]   you could imagine this with glass.
[00:51:37.420 --> 00:51:38.900]   So imagine that wire or thing.
[00:51:38.900 --> 00:51:41.140]   We're OK to look at the back of your TV screen.
[00:51:41.140 --> 00:51:42.780]   Yeah, let me look at see what you got there.
[00:51:42.780 --> 00:51:43.300]   Yeah.
[00:51:43.300 --> 00:51:44.300]   Right.
[00:51:44.300 --> 00:51:46.020]   Mm.
[00:51:46.020 --> 00:51:47.580]   I might try this.
[00:51:47.580 --> 00:51:49.020]   I'm going to send them a--
[00:51:49.020 --> 00:51:51.140]   I don't know, when would I have time to do this?
[00:51:51.140 --> 00:51:53.300]   I don't have the counseling possibilities.
[00:51:53.300 --> 00:51:54.300]   I do too.
[00:51:54.300 --> 00:51:56.620]   I would like someone who was like, my kid just came out
[00:51:56.620 --> 00:51:57.580]   and I don't know what to do.
[00:51:57.580 --> 00:52:00.500]   I just need to talk to somebody who's had this experience.
[00:52:00.500 --> 00:52:01.500]   Or I'm--
[00:52:01.500 --> 00:52:02.500]   I love that.
[00:52:02.500 --> 00:52:03.860]   --kind of so much credit card debt.
[00:52:03.860 --> 00:52:04.860]   I don't know what to do.
[00:52:04.860 --> 00:52:06.140]   I'm reaching out.
[00:52:06.140 --> 00:52:08.300]   I just need somebody to talk to my finances with me.
[00:52:08.300 --> 00:52:11.100]   It would be my guess that the more specific you are,
[00:52:11.100 --> 00:52:14.180]   if you actually said, I'm going to do help outs on--
[00:52:14.180 --> 00:52:17.180]   is your kid coming out, let me help you with the transition,
[00:52:17.180 --> 00:52:18.940]   would be much more effective than saying,
[00:52:18.940 --> 00:52:20.500]   I'm just a general counselor.
[00:52:20.500 --> 00:52:21.500]   Yes.
[00:52:21.500 --> 00:52:22.500]   Agreed.
[00:52:22.500 --> 00:52:23.500]   Be specific.
[00:52:23.500 --> 00:52:24.500]   I still go back to the health thing.
[00:52:24.500 --> 00:52:29.500]   If I could get a doctor's consultation for the cost of my copay.
[00:52:29.500 --> 00:52:30.500]   What is this lump?
[00:52:30.500 --> 00:52:31.740]   I have this lump.
[00:52:31.740 --> 00:52:33.900]   What is this lump?
[00:52:33.900 --> 00:52:37.660]   It is-- why is my skin gray?
[00:52:37.660 --> 00:52:39.060]   I'm trying to get Obamacare.
[00:52:39.060 --> 00:52:40.820]   How the hell do I get Obamacare?
[00:52:40.820 --> 00:52:42.900]   Oh, there I go.
[00:52:42.900 --> 00:52:44.900]   You know who contacted us and wants to get on the show
[00:52:44.900 --> 00:52:49.580]   Harper Reed, and I wonder if he wants to talk about that.
[00:52:49.580 --> 00:52:50.580]   I have him on.
[00:52:50.580 --> 00:52:51.580]   He's great.
[00:52:51.580 --> 00:52:52.580]   He's great.
[00:52:52.580 --> 00:52:54.220]   We've had him on before, and we're going to get him on again.
[00:52:54.220 --> 00:52:57.460]   But I'm guessing that he's not currently involved with the Obama administration,
[00:52:57.460 --> 00:53:01.620]   but he did their digital strategy for the 2008 election.
[00:53:01.620 --> 00:53:03.700]   I think everybody's involved again.
[00:53:03.700 --> 00:53:09.620]   I'm willing to bet, and I don't know, I'll ask him, that he got the call.
[00:53:09.620 --> 00:53:15.620]   They said, we need some techy people to go out there and explain what's going on.
[00:53:15.620 --> 00:53:16.940]   But I don't know, we'll find out.
[00:53:16.940 --> 00:53:19.020]   He reached out to us.
[00:53:19.020 --> 00:53:25.020]   Top Chef University, vegan, vegetarian, lifestyle, cooking, Caribbean cooking.
[00:53:25.020 --> 00:53:26.420]   This is really a neat idea.
[00:53:26.420 --> 00:53:27.780]   Anyway, we could go on and on.
[00:53:27.780 --> 00:53:29.500]   This is becoming an ad.
[00:53:29.500 --> 00:53:35.500]   But I think this is where you really have-- Google has really built-- I said this a
[00:53:35.500 --> 00:53:40.860]   while ago, at Google I/O, you really get the feeling that they've built a platform, and
[00:53:40.860 --> 00:53:45.100]   now they have the opportunity to really explore it in so many ways.
[00:53:45.100 --> 00:53:47.220]   Compare this to the Kindle's new.
[00:53:47.220 --> 00:53:48.220]   What's it called?
[00:53:48.220 --> 00:53:49.220]   Oh, yeah, Mayday.
[00:53:49.220 --> 00:53:50.220]   The Mayday button.
[00:53:50.220 --> 00:53:51.220]   Mayday.
[00:53:51.220 --> 00:53:53.220]   That's just to help you with the Kindle.
[00:53:53.220 --> 00:53:54.220]   Right.
[00:53:54.220 --> 00:53:59.380]   It's a little creepy, because it has a very attractive young woman, and a guy calls her
[00:53:59.380 --> 00:54:01.460]   up, and they kind of flirt with each other.
[00:54:01.460 --> 00:54:02.460]   It's a little creepy.
[00:54:02.460 --> 00:54:05.460]   Oh, yeah, the flirting Mayday thing.
[00:54:05.460 --> 00:54:07.820]   Yeah, he's like, I like you, Jennifer.
[00:54:07.820 --> 00:54:08.820]   It's weird.
[00:54:08.820 --> 00:54:09.820]   It's totally turned me off.
[00:54:09.820 --> 00:54:10.820]   I was like, whoa.
[00:54:10.820 --> 00:54:11.820]   It's creepy.
[00:54:11.820 --> 00:54:12.820]   Oh, good.
[00:54:12.820 --> 00:54:13.820]   I'm glad it wasn't just me.
[00:54:13.820 --> 00:54:14.820]   Totally agree.
[00:54:14.820 --> 00:54:15.820]   Like, oh, great.
[00:54:15.820 --> 00:54:18.340]   I get to give customer support and also get hate on.
[00:54:18.340 --> 00:54:19.340]   Awesome.
[00:54:19.340 --> 00:54:20.340]   I felt bad for Jennifer.
[00:54:20.340 --> 00:54:21.340]   I did.
[00:54:21.340 --> 00:54:22.340]   I didn't do.
[00:54:22.340 --> 00:54:27.140]   I was like, oh, Jennifer is the one calling Mayday.
[00:54:27.140 --> 00:54:29.660]   And she was so-- no, no, the guy calls Mayday.
[00:54:29.660 --> 00:54:30.660]   No, I'm joking.
[00:54:30.660 --> 00:54:31.860]   Jennifer had to call Mayday.
[00:54:31.860 --> 00:54:32.860]   Yeah, help me.
[00:54:32.860 --> 00:54:34.300]   Let me play it for you.
[00:54:34.300 --> 00:54:35.300]   You be the judge.
[00:54:35.300 --> 00:54:36.300]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:54:36.300 --> 00:54:38.300]   There's an ad in front of the ad.
[00:54:38.300 --> 00:54:39.300]   Hold on a second.
[00:54:39.300 --> 00:54:44.140]   It's not overt, you know, hitting on, but--
[00:54:44.140 --> 00:54:45.140]   Here, here, here.
[00:54:45.140 --> 00:54:46.140]   This is happening.
[00:54:46.140 --> 00:54:47.820]   Is it-- I don't know if there's audio.
[00:54:47.820 --> 00:54:49.500]   Thank you for pressing Mayday button.
[00:54:49.500 --> 00:54:50.500]   How can I help you?
[00:54:50.500 --> 00:54:51.660]   Whoa, who are you?
[00:54:51.660 --> 00:54:52.660]   You're cute.
[00:54:52.660 --> 00:54:54.460]   I'm Amy, a tech advisor for your new Kindle Fire.
[00:54:54.460 --> 00:54:56.140]   I didn't realize I get a live person.
[00:54:56.140 --> 00:54:57.140]   Can you come over now?
[00:54:57.140 --> 00:54:58.140]   I think we're seven.
[00:54:58.140 --> 00:55:00.460]   We can draw on your screen and even show you how to use different features.
[00:55:00.460 --> 00:55:02.140]   But can you show me how to use this feature?
[00:55:02.140 --> 00:55:03.140]   It's a Mayday button.
[00:55:03.140 --> 00:55:04.140]   You're here to help?
[00:55:04.140 --> 00:55:05.140]   It mayday.
[00:55:05.140 --> 00:55:06.140]   You're coming to the rescue.
[00:55:06.140 --> 00:55:08.140]   Amy, I like you.
[00:55:08.140 --> 00:55:09.140]   Aww.
[00:55:09.140 --> 00:55:10.140]   Can I have you, you creeper?
[00:55:10.140 --> 00:55:11.140]   That F-Y-L.
[00:55:11.140 --> 00:55:12.140]   Yeah.
[00:55:12.140 --> 00:55:17.140]   Is that-- aww, I don't know what to say because I'm slightly uncomfortable.
[00:55:17.140 --> 00:55:18.140]   Aww.
[00:55:18.140 --> 00:55:19.140]   Aww.
[00:55:19.140 --> 00:55:20.140]   I've made that.
[00:55:20.140 --> 00:55:21.140]   Aww.
[00:55:21.140 --> 00:55:22.140]   Aww.
[00:55:22.140 --> 00:55:24.140]   It made me so uncomfortable.
[00:55:24.140 --> 00:55:25.140]   It's so funny.
[00:55:25.140 --> 00:55:26.140]   I was so glad it wasn't just me.
[00:55:26.140 --> 00:55:30.140]   I'm glad that it wasn't just me because sometimes I worry that I'm a little too sensitive to
[00:55:30.140 --> 00:55:31.140]   these things.
[00:55:31.140 --> 00:55:32.140]   So I'm glad that you said it, Leo.
[00:55:32.140 --> 00:55:34.140]   No, it should have been two guys.
[00:55:34.140 --> 00:55:36.140]   It would have been much better.
[00:55:36.140 --> 00:55:38.140]   And then he could have gone, aww.
[00:55:38.140 --> 00:55:39.140]   Aww.
[00:55:39.140 --> 00:55:40.140]   Aww.
[00:55:40.140 --> 00:55:41.140]   I love you, man.
[00:55:41.140 --> 00:55:42.140]   Bro!
[00:55:42.140 --> 00:55:44.140]   There's not really this TV in this movie.
[00:55:44.140 --> 00:55:45.140]   I like you, John.
[00:55:45.140 --> 00:55:48.140]   I love you so far for tech support.
[00:55:48.140 --> 00:55:54.140]   I wonder, has anybody ever used the made-up button?
[00:55:54.140 --> 00:55:58.140]   Who uses that except lonely guys hoping that Jennifer will answer?
[00:55:58.140 --> 00:56:00.140]   Well, I don't know what it is.
[00:56:00.140 --> 00:56:03.140]   It's kind of like a chat roulette for the Kindle.
[00:56:03.140 --> 00:56:05.140]   I'm so glad I'm not the CSR.
[00:56:05.140 --> 00:56:07.140]   It's not like that, but it's the thing.
[00:56:07.140 --> 00:56:09.140]   I'm so glad I'm not a CSR.
[00:56:09.140 --> 00:56:11.140]   It's the human clippy.
[00:56:11.140 --> 00:56:12.140]   It is the human clippy.
[00:56:12.140 --> 00:56:17.140]   I think Kevin Rose did it and screencast it just to see what it was like.
[00:56:17.140 --> 00:56:18.140]   Oh, did he know?
[00:56:18.140 --> 00:56:19.140]   He did the day.
[00:56:19.140 --> 00:56:20.140]   How do I get to settings?
[00:56:20.140 --> 00:56:22.140]   And it was a dude who looked nothing like Jennifer.
[00:56:22.140 --> 00:56:23.140]   That's the problem.
[00:56:23.140 --> 00:56:24.140]   By the way, her name is Amy.
[00:56:24.140 --> 00:56:25.140]   We've been corrected.
[00:56:25.140 --> 00:56:26.140]   Amy, sorry.
[00:56:26.140 --> 00:56:27.140]   Kevin Rose Mayday.
[00:56:27.140 --> 00:56:28.140]   That's good.
[00:56:28.140 --> 00:56:30.140]   I thought he tweeted a while back.
[00:56:30.140 --> 00:56:33.140]   He said it's amazing.
[00:56:33.140 --> 00:56:34.140]   Man Mayday is a name.
[00:56:34.140 --> 00:56:35.140]   He's genius, I agree.
[00:56:35.140 --> 00:56:39.140]   But if your product needs that, that tells you something.
[00:56:39.140 --> 00:56:41.140]   Yeah, I'm sure they debated that.
[00:56:41.140 --> 00:56:42.140]   Should we...
[00:56:42.140 --> 00:56:45.140]   Yeah, see, he got a dude named Anthony.
[00:56:45.140 --> 00:56:49.140]   And Anthony is not sitting in a futuristic space.
[00:56:49.140 --> 00:56:52.140]   He's sitting in a call center and you can see the ducting on the roof.
[00:56:52.140 --> 00:56:54.140]   It's not nearly so sexy.
[00:56:54.140 --> 00:56:56.140]   Hey, Anthony.
[00:56:56.140 --> 00:56:58.140]   Yo, let's play the video.
[00:56:58.140 --> 00:56:59.140]   You want to watch?
[00:56:59.140 --> 00:57:01.140]   Oh, thank you so much.
[00:57:01.140 --> 00:57:03.140]   And how are you doing today, Kevin?
[00:57:03.140 --> 00:57:05.140]   I'm just looking to get into the settings.
[00:57:05.140 --> 00:57:06.140]   Can you show me how to do that?
[00:57:06.140 --> 00:57:07.140]   I'm going down from the time.
[00:57:07.140 --> 00:57:08.140]   Yeah, I see that line.
[00:57:08.140 --> 00:57:09.140]   Wipe down.
[00:57:09.140 --> 00:57:11.140]   It's just like a regular tech support.
[00:57:11.140 --> 00:57:12.140]   Great.
[00:57:12.140 --> 00:57:13.140]   Thank you.
[00:57:13.140 --> 00:57:14.140]   You're very welcome.
[00:57:14.140 --> 00:57:15.140]   Aww.
[00:57:15.140 --> 00:57:16.140]   Aww.
[00:57:16.140 --> 00:57:20.140]   [laughter]
[00:57:20.140 --> 00:57:26.140]   It would be better if Kevin weren't looking at the latest issue of Men's Health magazine during the call, I must say.
[00:57:26.140 --> 00:57:29.140]   I like that a little flavor to that.
[00:57:29.140 --> 00:57:31.140]   Aww.
[00:57:31.140 --> 00:57:33.140]   Aww.
[00:57:33.140 --> 00:57:35.140]   That's what you're going to get.
[00:57:35.140 --> 00:57:36.140]   Let's be honest.
[00:57:36.140 --> 00:57:37.140]   You're not getting Amy.
[00:57:37.140 --> 00:57:38.140]   It's a notification sound.
[00:57:38.140 --> 00:57:41.140]   Amy is not working at Amazon's call center.
[00:57:41.140 --> 00:57:43.140]   Kevin and Anthony sit in a tree.
[00:57:43.140 --> 00:57:44.140]   Aww.
[00:57:44.140 --> 00:57:45.140]   Aww.
[00:57:45.140 --> 00:57:47.140]   [laughter]
[00:57:47.140 --> 00:57:48.140]   Sorry, sorry.
[00:57:48.140 --> 00:57:50.140]   [laughter]
[00:57:50.140 --> 00:57:57.140]   We're going to take a break now so everybody can collect themselves, take a deep breath, think about what's happened here today.
[00:57:57.140 --> 00:58:03.140]   [laughter]
[00:58:03.140 --> 00:58:05.140]   A show they brought to you by Squarespace.
[00:58:05.140 --> 00:58:07.140]   They actually have great support.
[00:58:07.140 --> 00:58:10.140]   You know, I wouldn't be surprised if they put in a May Day button at some point.
[00:58:10.140 --> 00:58:21.140]   Squarespace, of course, is the best hosting with the best software, giving you the best web experience of your life, whether you just want a blog or a photographer wants a great portfolio, or maybe you make something you want to sell.
[00:58:21.140 --> 00:58:26.140]   Squarespace is a great way to get in the net.
[00:58:26.140 --> 00:58:31.140]   They constantly improve their platform, new features, new designs, new support.
[00:58:31.140 --> 00:58:34.140]   They have more than 20 beautiful templates you'll start with.
[00:58:34.140 --> 00:58:35.140]   They've won numerous design awards.
[00:58:35.140 --> 00:58:39.140]   It's very easy to use, but of course, 24/7, they're somebody there to help you.
[00:58:39.140 --> 00:58:42.140]   Their customer support team has numerous industry awards.
[00:58:42.140 --> 00:58:45.140]   They just got a gold and Stevie for outstanding service.
[00:58:45.140 --> 00:58:49.140]   And the best part is you could try it free for two weeks.
[00:58:49.140 --> 00:58:51.140]   You don't need to give them a credit card.
[00:58:51.140 --> 00:58:52.140]   Really see what it is.
[00:58:52.140 --> 00:58:53.140]   Try it out.
[00:58:53.140 --> 00:59:00.140]   If you decide this is the next home for your website after two weeks, by the way, you can import all your existing content.
[00:59:00.140 --> 00:59:01.140]   You're never stuck.
[00:59:01.140 --> 00:59:02.140]   It's easy to export as well.
[00:59:02.140 --> 00:59:04.140]   They have APIs for all the blog platforms.
[00:59:04.140 --> 00:59:05.140]   Look at the price.
[00:59:05.140 --> 00:59:07.140]   It's very straightforward.
[00:59:07.140 --> 00:59:11.140]   As little as $8 a month with an annual plan, but most people go with the unlimited plan.
[00:59:11.140 --> 00:59:18.140]   When you buy a year at $16 a month, you get unlimited pages, unlimited galleries, unlimited blogs, unlimited bandwidth.
[00:59:18.140 --> 00:59:20.140]   You could be the most popular site in the world.
[00:59:20.140 --> 00:59:21.140]   You'll never get a bandwidth bill.
[00:59:21.140 --> 00:59:23.140]   Believe me, nobody else does that.
[00:59:23.140 --> 00:59:25.140]   Unlimited storage, unlimited contributors.
[00:59:25.140 --> 00:59:27.140]   You could do the verge on here.
[00:59:27.140 --> 00:59:31.140]   You could have 100 writers on a $16 a month plan.
[00:59:31.140 --> 00:59:37.140]   Mobile website, if you register for a year, they'll get you a custom domain name free and hook it up.
[00:59:37.140 --> 00:59:39.140]   And of course, the best support in the world they've got.
[00:59:39.140 --> 00:59:48.140]   A whole support site, forums, they've got webinars, online training, all included with that amazing price.
[00:59:48.140 --> 00:59:51.140]   Now, if you want to sell, you're going to go to the business plan.
[00:59:51.140 --> 00:59:54.140]   That's $24 a month when you buy an annual plan.
[00:59:54.140 --> 00:59:56.140]   And that gives you fully integrated commerce.
[00:59:56.140 --> 01:00:01.140]   No transaction fees, unlimited physical or digital or service products.
[01:00:01.140 --> 01:00:04.140]   Unlimited pages, storage bandwidth, contributors, all of that.
[01:00:04.140 --> 01:00:06.140]   The inventory tracking is free.
[01:00:06.140 --> 01:00:10.140]   They'll do all the tax calculations, all the shipping calculations.
[01:00:10.140 --> 01:00:15.140]   You can even do coupons, unlimited coupons anytime you feel like it.
[01:00:15.140 --> 01:00:16.140]   It's just the best.
[01:00:16.140 --> 01:00:20.140]   The best hosting, always secure because their software is always up to date.
[01:00:20.140 --> 01:00:22.140]   Right now, you can try it for free.
[01:00:22.140 --> 01:00:23.140]   Just click the Get Started button.
[01:00:23.140 --> 01:00:25.140]   If you decide to buy, we're going to get you 10% off.

[01:00:34.140 --> 01:00:37.140]   And we thank you for supporting Squarespace.
[01:00:37.140 --> 01:00:38.140]   We're supporting this week in Google.
[01:00:38.140 --> 01:00:40.140]   We love Squarespace.
[01:00:40.140 --> 01:00:42.140]   The gang over there is just fabulous.
[01:00:42.140 --> 01:00:47.140]   Squarespace.com, use the offer code Twig 11 when you decide to buy.
[01:00:47.140 --> 01:00:50.140]   Yes, Jeff?
[01:00:50.140 --> 01:00:55.140]   One quick note related to what we just talked about, Google also announced connected
[01:00:55.140 --> 01:00:59.140]   classrooms where classrooms can use Hangouts to take field trips.
[01:00:59.140 --> 01:01:00.140]   Wow.
[01:01:00.140 --> 01:01:01.140]   That's what we mentioned.
[01:01:01.140 --> 01:01:05.140]   This educational push is really interesting to see how they're using the cost to do that.
[01:01:05.140 --> 01:01:07.140]   Well, and it's very clear they're not pushing just an education.
[01:01:07.140 --> 01:01:08.140]   They're pushing everywhere.
[01:01:08.140 --> 01:01:13.140]   They're building a barge for parties.
[01:01:13.140 --> 01:01:18.140]   They're all about connecting people on their platform.
[01:01:18.140 --> 01:01:19.140]   What's a barge?
[01:01:19.140 --> 01:01:26.140]   They finally have admitted that we know they've been building this barge in the San Francisco Bay area.
[01:01:26.140 --> 01:01:31.140]   We speculated it might be a floating data center.
[01:01:31.140 --> 01:01:37.140]   Our local channel 5KPIX said, no, we know it's a Google Glass showroom.
[01:01:37.140 --> 01:01:39.140]   It's just sounded ridiculous.
[01:01:39.140 --> 01:01:41.140]   Without Windows.
[01:01:41.140 --> 01:01:45.140]   Now, finally, Google has said, sadly, none of the above.
[01:01:45.140 --> 01:01:49.140]   They told USA Today, although it's still in early days and things may change, we're exploring
[01:01:49.140 --> 01:01:54.140]   using the barge as an interactive space where people can learn about new technology.
[01:01:54.140 --> 01:01:56.140]   Well, maybe it is for Google Glass.
[01:01:56.140 --> 01:01:57.140]   Oh.
[01:01:57.140 --> 01:01:58.140]   Oh.
[01:01:58.140 --> 01:02:03.140]   Um, not exactly a party barge.
[01:02:03.140 --> 01:02:05.140]   More like a gadget barge.
[01:02:05.140 --> 01:02:10.140]   For us, that's a party.
[01:02:10.140 --> 01:02:15.140]   Uh, there's the party deck up top and showrooms down below.
[01:02:15.140 --> 01:02:16.140]   This is what channel 5 speculated.
[01:02:16.140 --> 01:02:18.140]   I guess channel 5 is the most accurate.
[01:02:18.140 --> 01:02:19.140]   Uh, so far.
[01:02:19.140 --> 01:02:21.140]   Oh, no, you don't know what I think this really is.
[01:02:21.140 --> 01:02:25.140]   Remember when Larry Page said of the I/O that he wanted this country where he could do it and he wanted to?
[01:02:25.140 --> 01:02:27.140]   That sounds more like it.
[01:02:27.140 --> 01:02:28.140]   It's the barge.
[01:02:28.140 --> 01:02:29.140]   It's the beginning of the...
[01:02:29.140 --> 01:02:30.140]   I'll move in.
[01:02:30.140 --> 01:02:31.140]   They're making four.
[01:02:31.140 --> 01:02:32.140]   We know they've got one in Maine.
[01:02:32.140 --> 01:02:33.140]   They've got one in San Francisco.
[01:02:33.140 --> 01:02:35.140]   There's two others which we can't pinpoint.
[01:02:35.140 --> 01:02:37.140]   But really, maybe it's not four.
[01:02:37.140 --> 01:02:39.140]   It's 4,000 and they're going to tie them all together in the middle of the ocean.
[01:02:39.140 --> 01:02:41.140]   And then suddenly Google land.
[01:02:41.140 --> 01:02:42.140]   Yay.
[01:02:42.140 --> 01:02:43.140]   Out there.
[01:02:43.140 --> 01:02:44.140]   I would go.
[01:02:44.140 --> 01:02:47.140]   Google, if you want me to move, we'll do the show from there.
[01:02:47.140 --> 01:02:49.140]   Great.
[01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:51.140]   You'll have a good bandwidth.
[01:02:51.140 --> 01:02:52.140]   Although did you see this?
[01:02:52.140 --> 01:02:53.140]   L.A.
[01:02:53.140 --> 01:02:57.140]   The city of Los Angeles is going straight up against Google.
[01:02:57.140 --> 01:03:01.140]   Uh, to create a fiber network.
[01:03:01.140 --> 01:03:06.140]   They have, they're asking for bids that would wire every one of the three and a half million
[01:03:06.140 --> 01:03:12.140]   people who live in Los Angeles.
[01:03:12.140 --> 01:03:14.140]   What an interesting idea they want.
[01:03:14.140 --> 01:03:18.140]   It sounds a little like the old days of cable where somebody wins the franchise and then
[01:03:18.140 --> 01:03:19.140]   then you're stuck with their monopoly.
[01:03:19.140 --> 01:03:20.140]   Nope.
[01:03:20.140 --> 01:03:23.140]   They say one of the deals it has to be open.
[01:03:23.140 --> 01:03:24.140]   Oh.
[01:03:24.140 --> 01:03:26.140]   Anybody can ride on it.
[01:03:26.140 --> 01:03:27.140]   Oh.
[01:03:27.140 --> 01:03:29.140]   Now, I don't know if anybody's going to go for it.
[01:03:29.140 --> 01:03:32.140]   The other thing, the city says, we're not paying for this.
[01:03:32.140 --> 01:03:35.140]   Uh, three to five billion dollar cost of building fiber.
[01:03:35.140 --> 01:03:40.140]   Uh, the company must offer free service of at least two megabits to every L.A.
[01:03:40.140 --> 01:03:41.140]   resident.
[01:03:41.140 --> 01:03:48.140]   The company must sell access to the network to competitors answering your problem.
[01:03:48.140 --> 01:03:50.140]   So basically they want that infrastructure.
[01:03:50.140 --> 01:03:51.140]   Yeah.
[01:03:51.140 --> 01:03:56.140]   They want gigabit wide, gig, gigabit city wide fiber.
[01:03:56.140 --> 01:04:01.540]   Oh, and the other reason it's not like Google, although I guess Google could bid, uh, is
[01:04:01.540 --> 01:04:04.140]   that it will be the business components very important.
[01:04:04.140 --> 01:04:06.140]   They want to make sure business is also benefit from this.
[01:04:06.140 --> 01:04:08.140]   Google right now is consumers only.
[01:04:08.140 --> 01:04:18.460]   Um, the city manager, actually technology agency general manager for Los Angeles information
[01:04:18.460 --> 01:04:24.940]   technology, Steve Reniker told ours, he hopes much of the cost of building the network will
[01:04:24.940 --> 01:04:28.820]   be offset by selling television service bundles with the internet service.
[01:04:28.820 --> 01:04:33.260]   So they're saying, uh, you can come in, you can wire it for fiber.
[01:04:33.260 --> 01:04:36.700]   Uh, and you make your money by offering triple plays.
[01:04:36.700 --> 01:04:38.940]   They can do phone service as well.
[01:04:38.940 --> 01:04:40.740]   Right.
[01:04:40.740 --> 01:04:45.780]   Uh, about a third of the city makes less than $45,000 a year.
[01:04:45.780 --> 01:04:47.340]   So there's a real concern.
[01:04:47.340 --> 01:04:50.140]   They want to part of part of what I think this is a great plan.
[01:04:50.140 --> 01:04:53.940]   If they, if I don't even know, I mean, they're, they're asking there, there is an RFP.
[01:04:53.940 --> 01:04:57.020]   They're asking people to say they'll do it.
[01:04:57.020 --> 01:05:01.500]   Um, if they can, if they can make this deal work for some company, it's great for the
[01:05:01.500 --> 01:05:07.100]   people of Los Angeles, but this is the kind of thing Philadelphia did and got, you know,
[01:05:07.100 --> 01:05:11.300]   immediately sued by a Comcast and everybody else.
[01:05:11.300 --> 01:05:15.780]   Cities have been trying to do a free wifi for a long time.
[01:05:15.780 --> 01:05:21.100]   Um, the state's past special case laws, just to prohibit this right for being lobbied by
[01:05:21.100 --> 01:05:24.100]   the telcos.
[01:05:24.100 --> 01:05:25.460]   Right.
[01:05:25.460 --> 01:05:26.460]   This is the same city.
[01:05:26.460 --> 01:05:29.660]   By the way, that's rolling out iPads to each of its 650,000 students.
[01:05:29.660 --> 01:05:31.820]   That's that up royally.
[01:05:31.820 --> 01:05:38.380]   LA wants the winning bidder to make donations of home broadband equipment to nonprofits.
[01:05:38.380 --> 01:05:42.140]   Those nonprofits will then distribute them to needy residents.
[01:05:42.140 --> 01:05:45.340]   Cities going to take bids for three months.
[01:05:45.340 --> 01:05:50.100]   Um, I, you know, if I, if this works, it's great.
[01:05:50.100 --> 01:05:51.100]   Yeah.
[01:05:51.100 --> 01:05:55.300]   I, but what company's got three to five billion?
[01:05:55.300 --> 01:05:56.900]   Maybe it's maybe it's kind of thing Google would do.
[01:05:56.900 --> 01:05:57.900]   I don't know.
[01:05:57.900 --> 01:05:59.220]   What a, what a market to have though.
[01:05:59.220 --> 01:06:01.060]   You're there with, you got L.A.
[01:06:01.060 --> 01:06:02.060]   Poor people.
[01:06:02.060 --> 01:06:03.060]   You got L.A.
[01:06:03.060 --> 01:06:04.060]   You got all the showbiz there.
[01:06:04.060 --> 01:06:05.060]   You got.
[01:06:05.060 --> 01:06:10.500]   Um, just what Bloomberg didn't do that in New York.
[01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:11.500]   Yeah.
[01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:15.380]   You know, I mean, this will be, I think New York's looking everybody's looking to see
[01:06:15.380 --> 01:06:16.980]   if this works for L.A.
[01:06:16.980 --> 01:06:19.460]   I bet everybody does this is really smart.
[01:06:19.460 --> 01:06:22.060]   What do you think of the, your new mayor, Mr. Blasio?
[01:06:22.060 --> 01:06:23.660]   Don't know yet.
[01:06:23.660 --> 01:06:27.140]   My friend, Chris Anderson, not that Chris Anderson, not that Chris Anderson, my other
[01:06:27.140 --> 01:06:29.900]   Chris Anderson, the third Chris Anderson, the third Chris Anderson, the journalism
[01:06:29.900 --> 01:06:31.980]   Chris Anderson, I had a great tweet this morning.
[01:06:31.980 --> 01:06:34.820]   He said, trains late, only eight hours into the administration.
[01:06:34.820 --> 01:06:39.620]   No, he's not a mayor.
[01:06:39.620 --> 01:06:40.620]   Yeah.
[01:06:40.620 --> 01:06:41.620]   Right.
[01:06:41.620 --> 01:06:42.620]   Bloomberg's still the mayor.
[01:06:42.620 --> 01:06:43.620]   Right.
[01:06:43.620 --> 01:06:44.620]   Yeah.
[01:06:44.620 --> 01:06:45.620]   There's a great picture today of Bloomberg and the Blasio meeting.
[01:06:45.620 --> 01:06:46.620]   Bloomberg's just looking off.
[01:06:46.620 --> 01:06:51.620]   This is our moment.
[01:06:51.620 --> 01:06:56.620]   Well, Bloomberg's mayor for hell on 12 years.
[01:06:56.620 --> 01:06:57.620]   Three terms.
[01:06:57.620 --> 01:06:58.620]   Yeah.
[01:06:58.620 --> 01:06:59.620]   Whoo.
[01:06:59.620 --> 01:07:00.620]   That's a long time.
[01:07:00.620 --> 01:07:01.620]   I think he did a good job.
[01:07:01.620 --> 01:07:04.620]   I mean, it's not universally held, but I think that he did a good job.
[01:07:04.620 --> 01:07:08.620]   I like the bicycles and the techno cracks.
[01:07:08.620 --> 01:07:11.620]   We had an effort at the techno crack running Jack Hittery.
[01:07:11.620 --> 01:07:15.620]   Um, an entrepreneur here in New York was trying to run as an independent, but never really got
[01:07:15.620 --> 01:07:16.620]   to be able to see what helped.
[01:07:16.620 --> 01:07:18.860]   I've been loving the Google doodles this week.
[01:07:18.860 --> 01:07:20.100]   Have you noticed them?
[01:07:20.100 --> 01:07:21.100]   Yeah.
[01:07:21.100 --> 01:07:22.100]   Yeah.
[01:07:22.100 --> 01:07:25.100]   Actually, they were showing up in Google now for me, or at least one thing.
[01:07:25.100 --> 01:07:26.100]   Yes, they do.
[01:07:26.100 --> 01:07:31.460]   The train, the gorgeous train illustration showed up, which is like, oh, I actually get
[01:07:31.460 --> 01:07:33.220]   to see the Google, the doodles now.
[01:07:33.220 --> 01:07:34.620]   They're in Google now.
[01:07:34.620 --> 01:07:35.620]   Yeah.
[01:07:35.620 --> 01:07:42.180]   They've always had graphics where they would show something that's related to either your
[01:07:42.180 --> 01:07:44.260]   locale or the time of day, right?
[01:07:44.260 --> 01:07:45.260]   Yep.
[01:07:45.260 --> 01:07:48.100]   So I have a bay with a whale spouting.
[01:07:48.100 --> 01:07:51.380]   I don't think that's the Google doodle.
[01:07:51.380 --> 01:07:53.420]   Happy birthday, Tim Street, by the way.
[01:07:53.420 --> 01:07:54.420]   Is it?
[01:07:54.420 --> 01:07:56.540]   Yeah, that's the, the, the, the head of graphic.
[01:07:56.540 --> 01:07:58.380]   So I get a San Francisco, longest time in San Francisco.
[01:07:58.380 --> 01:07:59.380]   Yeah.
[01:07:59.380 --> 01:08:01.540]   But sometimes, but sometimes you'll get, and that's because there is no Google doodle
[01:08:01.540 --> 01:08:03.460]   today, but I got the train.
[01:08:03.460 --> 01:08:05.220]   What was the train to honor?
[01:08:05.220 --> 01:08:09.460]   That was a dude, a dude did engineering things.
[01:08:09.460 --> 01:08:10.460]   Did a train.
[01:08:10.460 --> 01:08:11.460]   Yeah.
[01:08:11.460 --> 01:08:13.460]   He had wore a striped cap with a bill.
[01:08:13.460 --> 01:08:17.740]   And then the human calculator, they had the calculator LCD.
[01:08:17.740 --> 01:08:18.740]   I didn't realize.
[01:08:18.740 --> 01:08:19.740]   I didn't know about her.
[01:08:19.740 --> 01:08:20.740]   Yeah.
[01:08:20.740 --> 01:08:22.980]   I mean, I think that's a neat, that's great story.
[01:08:22.980 --> 01:08:23.980]   That's, yeah.
[01:08:23.980 --> 01:08:29.980]   That's what the Google doodle should be.
[01:08:29.980 --> 01:08:34.820]   The first one, Leo, the maps I found interesting.
[01:08:34.820 --> 01:08:35.820]   Let's talk about it.
[01:08:35.820 --> 01:08:39.500]   Google Maps is more of a platform than we realized.
[01:08:39.500 --> 01:08:43.420]   To become more contextual to the time, the place in where you are, and also to use the
[01:08:43.420 --> 01:08:45.220]   view personally.
[01:08:45.220 --> 01:08:46.220]   And this is what I'm waiting for.
[01:08:46.220 --> 01:08:48.980]   This is where Forest Square, you know, is the competition for Forest Square.
[01:08:48.980 --> 01:08:51.980]   When I asked for pizza, does it give me the pizza my friends like?
[01:08:51.980 --> 01:08:52.980]   Right.
[01:08:52.980 --> 01:08:55.940]   Actually, were you at this talk, Kevin Marks?
[01:08:55.940 --> 01:08:56.940]   Because this was that.
[01:08:56.940 --> 01:08:58.940]   This was that road map.
[01:08:58.940 --> 01:08:59.940]   Yeah.
[01:08:59.940 --> 01:09:04.260]   And there was two of the Google guys that are on stage talking to, I'm about this.
[01:09:04.260 --> 01:09:07.380]   But they were basically saying, well, we can't tell you about future products, but what
[01:09:07.380 --> 01:09:10.540]   we'd like to tell you about is what we'd like to be able to do now, which is their way
[01:09:10.540 --> 01:09:12.180]   of saying we're going to do this eventually.
[01:09:12.180 --> 01:09:19.940]   And the point for them was to say they wanted to use, they said we want to make a map for
[01:09:19.940 --> 01:09:21.900]   every person for every place.
[01:09:21.900 --> 01:09:24.100]   So each map is unique.
[01:09:24.100 --> 01:09:27.340]   It draws on information that we know about you.
[01:09:27.340 --> 01:09:32.580]   So if there are places that are in your stream that we know about, then we'll highlight those
[01:09:32.580 --> 01:09:33.580]   on the map.
[01:09:33.580 --> 01:09:36.580]   And they'll use the recommendation filter, pop things up, which is also like another,
[01:09:36.580 --> 01:09:40.220]   oh, I see where the e-commerce bit comes in here.
[01:09:40.220 --> 01:09:45.860]   But they said we'd really also like to say if there's a football match on at the stadium,
[01:09:45.860 --> 01:09:47.460]   then it'll tell you the score of the football match.
[01:09:47.460 --> 01:09:50.500]   And that'll give you a clue as to how many minutes are left in the game.
[01:09:50.500 --> 01:09:52.540]   So you know that that's about to come out.
[01:09:52.540 --> 01:09:55.180]   And you probably don't want to drive past it.
[01:09:55.180 --> 01:10:00.220]   So they wanted to bring those kind of ideas into it as well, making it thinking of the
[01:10:00.220 --> 01:10:05.740]   map as a data layer that they're showing what their other data are on.
[01:10:05.740 --> 01:10:09.540]   And there was something they said was that to do this, the reason they can do this now
[01:10:09.540 --> 01:10:11.940]   is they spent a long time cleaning up data.
[01:10:11.940 --> 01:10:15.420]   And the time that you noticed when you write the visualization, that's when you realize
[01:10:15.420 --> 01:10:19.660]   that the data is bad, because as soon as you combine two sources, you see that things aren't
[01:10:19.660 --> 01:10:21.460]   on top of each other anymore.
[01:10:21.460 --> 01:10:26.380]   And that was so, as they started doing that for their data validation and overlaying things
[01:10:26.380 --> 01:10:28.900]   like that, then they realized, oh, we should bring some of the more of this into the product
[01:10:28.900 --> 01:10:29.900]   as well.
[01:10:29.900 --> 01:10:31.660]   So there was this interesting feedback loop between the two.
[01:10:31.660 --> 01:10:32.660]   That's definitely interesting talk.
[01:10:32.660 --> 01:10:35.060]   It's going to be worth watching that moment.
[01:10:35.060 --> 01:10:36.820]   Giga, go and put it up.
[01:10:36.820 --> 01:10:43.340]   Maybe some information also towards this supplied by the Nexus 5 design, which has lots of
[01:10:43.340 --> 01:10:45.220]   new sensors in it.
[01:10:45.220 --> 01:10:50.860]   They have an accelerometer, a magnetometer, a gyroscope, proximity sensor, of course,
[01:10:50.860 --> 01:10:53.700]   light sensor, barometer, gravity sensor.
[01:10:53.700 --> 01:10:54.700]   I don't know.
[01:10:54.700 --> 01:10:55.700]   Geez.
[01:10:55.700 --> 01:10:57.220]   You should be glad to know the gravity is normal here.
[01:10:57.220 --> 01:11:01.900]   Well, I think that's probably, well, I don't know, maybe I don't know.
[01:11:01.900 --> 01:11:02.900]   Linear acceleration, rotation.
[01:11:02.900 --> 01:11:03.900]   Or a little plane, maybe?
[01:11:03.900 --> 01:11:04.900]   I don't know.
[01:11:04.900 --> 01:11:09.580]   Well, if we're a hard drive, I would say to detect a drop, but I don't know what it's
[01:11:09.580 --> 01:11:10.580]   for.
[01:11:10.580 --> 01:11:13.380]   Let's try throwing that from the air and see what it says.
[01:11:13.380 --> 01:11:14.380]   Yeah.
[01:11:14.380 --> 01:11:15.380]   Take it off.
[01:11:15.380 --> 01:11:16.380]   Oh, yeah.
[01:11:16.380 --> 01:11:17.380]   The gravity is.
[01:11:17.380 --> 01:11:18.380]   Microgravity.
[01:11:18.380 --> 01:11:19.380]   See how that goes.
[01:11:19.380 --> 01:11:20.380]   That's a step.
[01:11:20.380 --> 01:11:21.380]   Bring the ladder out.
[01:11:21.380 --> 01:11:23.100]   There's a step detector, a step counter, a significant--
[01:11:23.100 --> 01:11:26.620]   Well, that's important because you're going to be able to use this as a pedometer.
[01:11:26.620 --> 01:11:27.620]   Right.
[01:11:27.620 --> 01:11:34.060]   Significant motion detector, game rotation vector, geomagnetic rotation vector, and orientation.
[01:11:34.060 --> 01:11:37.740]   These are all sensors built in to this device.
[01:11:37.740 --> 01:11:39.100]   What are you reading those with?
[01:11:39.100 --> 01:11:45.740]   This is a nice little app called CPUZ, or CPUZ, that I put on when I'm reviewing a product.
[01:11:45.740 --> 01:11:49.340]   It'll tell you what chip is on here, how many cores.
[01:11:49.340 --> 01:11:51.340]   You can actually see the core speeds.
[01:11:51.340 --> 01:11:53.660]   For instance, only two of my four cores are used right now.
[01:11:53.660 --> 01:11:56.140]   The other two are stopped.
[01:11:56.140 --> 01:11:58.220]   You could find out more about the system version and stuff.
[01:11:58.220 --> 01:12:03.660]   It's just a name-- it's like the old-- what was the name of that Bell Arc Advisor that
[01:12:03.660 --> 01:12:09.620]   would tell you everything that was in your hardware, battery level, sensors, nice little
[01:12:09.620 --> 01:12:11.620]   program, free program, CPUZ.
[01:12:11.620 --> 01:12:15.900]   Yeah, imagine how that gets used in all kinds of other shared data ways.
[01:12:15.900 --> 01:12:20.740]   Oh, by the way, Waze data has been spotted on Google Maps now.
[01:12:20.740 --> 01:12:21.740]   Finally.
[01:12:21.740 --> 01:12:22.740]   My beloved Waze, yes.
[01:12:22.740 --> 01:12:23.740]   Finally.
[01:12:23.740 --> 01:12:27.980]   Yeah, I mean, if you think about it, Maps has always been a platform because back in the
[01:12:27.980 --> 01:12:32.980]   old days when you could do map-- mashups, all the things people were doing with Maps.
[01:12:32.980 --> 01:12:34.900]   But now, I don't know.
[01:12:34.900 --> 01:12:39.100]   It seems like that Google made that harder to do or they charged people or something.
[01:12:39.100 --> 01:12:43.740]   I don't see as many map mashups as before.
[01:12:43.740 --> 01:12:45.260]   Maybe Google just wants to do more of it.
[01:12:45.260 --> 01:12:53.180]   They started charging for heavy YIEs.
[01:12:53.180 --> 01:12:54.180]   So this is--
[01:12:54.180 --> 01:12:55.620]   But there's always open maps then.
[01:12:55.620 --> 01:12:58.980]   Yeah, open map data is very good too.
[01:12:58.980 --> 01:13:05.260]   They've deprecated the V2 API, so that's an issue at the moment.
[01:13:05.260 --> 01:13:07.980]   It would make sense that this is the kind of thing Google would say, well, we'll take
[01:13:07.980 --> 01:13:08.980]   it from here.
[01:13:08.980 --> 01:13:09.980]   Yeah.
[01:13:09.980 --> 01:13:11.220]   I don't know though.
[01:13:11.220 --> 01:13:15.980]   Yeah, if you click on the maps thing, you'll see--
[01:13:15.980 --> 01:13:16.980]   Incidents.
[01:13:16.980 --> 01:13:17.980]   Right.
[01:13:17.980 --> 01:13:19.620]   Instant reported via Waze app and things like that.
[01:13:19.620 --> 01:13:21.100]   So those are showing up in Maps.
[01:13:21.100 --> 01:13:22.580]   Oh, it even credits Waze.
[01:13:22.580 --> 01:13:23.580]   That's good.
[01:13:23.580 --> 01:13:24.580]   Yeah.
[01:13:24.580 --> 01:13:25.580]   Now you know.
[01:13:25.580 --> 01:13:29.580]   And that was part of what they were saying.
[01:13:29.580 --> 01:13:31.260]   They were bringing more data in that way.
[01:13:31.260 --> 01:13:35.260]   I did have a brief chat to them afterwards and said, OK, well, this is very nice, but
[01:13:35.260 --> 01:13:37.420]   what happened to latitude?
[01:13:37.420 --> 01:13:40.300]   And they said, yeah, that didn't really fit in with the new architecture.
[01:13:40.300 --> 01:13:43.860]   We still want to bring that back at some point.
[01:13:43.860 --> 01:13:46.100]   They felt that the way it works wasn't quite right.
[01:13:46.100 --> 01:13:48.580]   Kevin, you and I were the only people using latitude.
[01:13:48.580 --> 01:13:50.300]   I always knew where Kevin was.
[01:13:50.300 --> 01:13:52.140]   You always knew where I was.
[01:13:52.140 --> 01:13:55.140]   I used it with my family because that's really handy when you got two sons who were
[01:13:55.140 --> 01:13:56.140]   driving.
[01:13:56.140 --> 01:13:57.420]   Where are you and where's my car?
[01:13:57.420 --> 01:13:58.420]   No, I agree.
[01:13:58.420 --> 01:14:00.420]   If you can get them to use it.
[01:14:00.420 --> 01:14:05.660]   Well, the counterpoint was, before they were driving, well, you know where you are,
[01:14:05.660 --> 01:14:07.180]   I can come and pick you up.
[01:14:07.180 --> 01:14:09.260]   But yeah, that's not working in it now.
[01:14:09.260 --> 01:14:13.580]   And the other one I've grown with about was Google Transit not knowing when you're actually
[01:14:13.580 --> 01:14:14.860]   on the transit.
[01:14:14.860 --> 01:14:16.420]   So you say, how do I get to the next place?
[01:14:16.420 --> 01:14:20.140]   It says, well, get off here and get on to the next bus behind you and then go to here.
[01:14:20.140 --> 01:14:22.140]   And they said, yeah, but that's hard.
[01:14:22.140 --> 01:14:24.740]   We want to fix that, but we don't have all that data yet.
[01:14:24.740 --> 01:14:31.780]   So, let's do a change log.
[01:14:31.780 --> 01:14:32.780]   You got the trumpeters.
[01:14:32.780 --> 01:14:34.420]   The trumpeters here.
[01:14:34.420 --> 01:14:36.180]   All right, get them.
[01:14:36.180 --> 01:14:37.180]   Get them ready.
[01:14:37.180 --> 01:14:48.900]   Get them off their smoke break because it's time for the Google change log.
[01:14:48.900 --> 01:14:51.860]   Gina Trapani as the latest from Google.
[01:14:51.860 --> 01:14:58.300]   Well, of course, the biggest item on the change log is KitKat on X5, which we've already covered
[01:14:58.300 --> 01:15:00.700]   pretty in depth earlier with your view, Leo.
[01:15:00.700 --> 01:15:03.460]   Thank you for doing that.
[01:15:03.460 --> 01:15:08.060]   Beyond KitKat, this is kind of an interesting Android change.
[01:15:08.060 --> 01:15:13.940]   Google announced that app indexing and Google search will begin providing deep links into
[01:15:13.940 --> 01:15:16.060]   apps in search results.
[01:15:16.060 --> 01:15:21.060]   So you're on your phone and you search for, you know, I don't know, firefly and you get
[01:15:21.060 --> 01:15:24.060]   the IMDB page back in your search results.
[01:15:24.060 --> 01:15:29.060]   If you've got the IMDB app installed and Google has indexed all the content inside the IMDB
[01:15:29.060 --> 01:15:32.140]   app, there will be a little button that says open in app.
[01:15:32.140 --> 01:15:36.700]   You tap that button and it launches the native app versus the website.
[01:15:36.700 --> 01:15:39.860]   So this is something the app developer has to do?
[01:15:39.860 --> 01:15:40.860]   Yes.
[01:15:40.860 --> 01:15:42.940]   So the app developer has to make their content.
[01:15:42.940 --> 01:15:45.980]   If you've got an app that contains a lot of content, there are some guidelines to make
[01:15:45.980 --> 01:15:50.020]   that content, you know, discoverable and indexable by Google, which Google has just
[01:15:50.020 --> 01:15:54.660]   published, and Google's going to start slowly sort of rolling this out.
[01:15:54.660 --> 01:15:59.580]   I think they've invited a few test companies in there to try this out.
[01:15:59.580 --> 01:16:05.700]   I think at sea IMDB, new egg, open table, Wikipedia and a few others.
[01:16:05.700 --> 01:16:08.060]   So this is pretty cool because you know how it works now.
[01:16:08.060 --> 01:16:14.460]   If you get a search result that's got a URL that Android recognizes, it might say open
[01:16:14.460 --> 01:16:15.460]   with.
[01:16:15.460 --> 01:16:16.460]   Do you want to open this with the native app?
[01:16:16.460 --> 01:16:17.460]   Do you want to open it up with Chrome?
[01:16:17.460 --> 01:16:18.820]   What do you want to open with?
[01:16:18.820 --> 01:16:23.460]   It just lets you go directly to inside the app, which would be pretty nice.
[01:16:23.460 --> 01:16:27.580]   Well, I don't want to push back on this because I think this is taking a feature that we've
[01:16:27.580 --> 01:16:31.020]   already got and then adding Google in the middle of it that spoils it because the way
[01:16:31.020 --> 01:16:35.180]   intense work is that you can any app can clean that URL.
[01:16:35.180 --> 01:16:40.620]   So I can write an app that pauses IMDB URLs and displays something else and you can install
[01:16:40.620 --> 01:16:41.620]   that.
[01:16:41.620 --> 01:16:42.820]   And when I click on it, it'll get there.
[01:16:42.820 --> 01:16:46.340]   Whereas this says you have to register with Google and Google will choose how to redirect
[01:16:46.340 --> 01:16:47.900]   you to where and so on.
[01:16:47.900 --> 01:16:53.700]   So it's much more like the stuff that Twitter's been doing with cards than it is the sort
[01:16:53.700 --> 01:16:57.020]   of cleanliness of Intense that's going to the platform.
[01:16:57.020 --> 01:17:01.700]   So I'm less happy about this than you are, I think.
[01:17:01.700 --> 01:17:04.860]   It looks like though, if you don't have the official app installed, it won't show up.
[01:17:04.860 --> 01:17:08.100]   And it also looks like if you just tap on the link that you'll still get the Intense
[01:17:08.100 --> 01:17:10.260]   prompt of like, what do you want to open this up in?
[01:17:10.260 --> 01:17:13.660]   So I don't actually think you're losing the choice, but I agree with you.
[01:17:13.660 --> 01:17:19.340]   This is definitely a way for apps and for sites to push their official app.
[01:17:19.340 --> 01:17:24.900]   And let's be honest, I'm so sick of going to mobile sites and getting at the top of
[01:17:24.900 --> 01:17:27.300]   the page like, hey, do you want to install Android app?
[01:17:27.300 --> 01:17:28.300]   No, no, no.
[01:17:28.300 --> 01:17:31.140]   Just bring me to the freaking page.
[01:17:31.140 --> 01:17:32.140]   And so I'm hoping that--
[01:17:32.140 --> 01:17:33.140]   And that's a win, yeah.
[01:17:33.140 --> 01:17:34.140]   Okay.
[01:17:34.140 --> 01:17:35.140]   Yeah.
[01:17:35.140 --> 01:17:39.860]   So if it prevents people from doing that on their mobile websites, if this is an option,
[01:17:39.860 --> 01:17:43.940]   I think that that'll probably hopefully fingers crossed see less of that.
[01:17:43.940 --> 01:17:44.940]   And then you still get the choice.
[01:17:44.940 --> 01:17:51.420]   I think you could still tap the link and choose to open it in another app.
[01:17:51.420 --> 01:17:54.580]   If you say have an alternate Wikipedia or IMDB app.
[01:17:54.580 --> 01:17:56.140]   What else have we got?
[01:17:56.140 --> 01:17:57.540]   Oh, Google Now for iOS.
[01:17:57.540 --> 01:17:58.780]   I've got a big update.
[01:17:58.780 --> 01:18:00.380]   It's got parity with Android now.
[01:18:00.380 --> 01:18:04.100]   It's got support for notifications and reminders.
[01:18:04.100 --> 01:18:09.020]   And when you launch the Google Now app on iOS, you can use the OK Google voice function
[01:18:09.020 --> 01:18:10.020]   as well.
[01:18:10.020 --> 01:18:11.980]   Excuse me.
[01:18:11.980 --> 01:18:14.540]   So yeah, you're getting the same kind of cards.
[01:18:14.540 --> 01:18:19.260]   You can get the Google Keep reminders and that kind of thing all on iOS.
[01:18:19.260 --> 01:18:23.420]   Of course, iOS doesn't have widget support and doesn't have the swipe up support that
[01:18:23.420 --> 01:18:25.900]   Android gets, but still a nice update.
[01:18:25.900 --> 01:18:29.580]   But it does have the voice support that Google Now has?
[01:18:29.580 --> 01:18:30.580]   Yeah, well, right.
[01:18:30.580 --> 01:18:35.940]   So if you launch Google Now on iOS, you can use the OK Google hot word.
[01:18:35.940 --> 01:18:40.020]   But from what I understand, I haven't actually installed this yet on my iPhone.
[01:18:40.020 --> 01:18:42.540]   You have to have launched the app first.
[01:18:42.540 --> 01:18:43.540]   So it's not always--
[01:18:43.540 --> 01:18:45.020]   Yeah, that makes sense, of course.
[01:18:45.020 --> 01:18:46.020]   Yes.
[01:18:46.020 --> 01:18:49.460]   And Google brings the hotel finder to mobile phones.
[01:18:49.460 --> 01:18:53.100]   Thank you, Jeff, for flipping this one into the change log for me.
[01:18:53.100 --> 01:19:00.140]   If you go to google.com/hotels, you can enter in a location where you're looking to find
[01:19:00.140 --> 01:19:05.940]   the hotel and there's a really nice way to search and filter and star and get hotel
[01:19:05.940 --> 01:19:09.100]   rates all kind of formatted for your mobile phone.
[01:19:09.100 --> 01:19:12.020]   This works in regular Google search results on your desktop right now.
[01:19:12.020 --> 01:19:15.060]   This is just a nice mobile interface.
[01:19:15.060 --> 01:19:19.860]   You can purchase-- you can make reservations with Google Wallet in the countries that support,
[01:19:19.860 --> 01:19:23.260]   which I think is just the United States right now.
[01:19:23.260 --> 01:19:27.100]   So that's really nice if you're looking to book a hotel on the go.
[01:19:27.100 --> 01:19:29.700]   And finally, I Google Rest in Peace.
[01:19:29.700 --> 01:19:35.700]   It was announced a year ago that iGoogle would be shut down and that has happened.
[01:19:35.700 --> 01:19:40.460]   If you go to google.com/ig, you just get redirected to the google.com homepage.
[01:19:40.460 --> 01:19:44.460]   No blog post announcement even.
[01:19:44.460 --> 01:19:50.140]   iGoogle has just slipped off into the history books.
[01:19:50.140 --> 01:19:52.820]   And that's all I've got for the change log.
[01:19:52.820 --> 01:19:54.700]   And that's Google change log.
[01:19:54.700 --> 01:19:59.700]   Thank you, Gina, for panning.
[01:19:59.700 --> 01:20:00.700]   Sure.
[01:20:00.700 --> 01:20:04.220]   [SINGING]
[01:20:04.220 --> 01:20:05.220]   What else?
[01:20:05.220 --> 01:20:12.020]   What did Steve have to say about the latest NSA stuff of NSA tapping the connections between
[01:20:12.020 --> 01:20:14.020]   the servers?
[01:20:14.020 --> 01:20:18.780]   Well he read the two posts, the Google+ post from two.
[01:20:18.780 --> 01:20:20.180]   Did he censor himself?
[01:20:20.180 --> 01:20:29.860]   He had to. basically, two of Google's engineers responded to the revelations that the NSA
[01:20:29.860 --> 01:20:31.740]   was tapping into least servers.
[01:20:31.740 --> 01:20:37.060]   What happened was Google wasn't using the public internet to transport this data.
[01:20:37.060 --> 01:20:41.060]   It was transporting it over least servers they owned.
[01:20:41.060 --> 01:20:47.100]   Nevertheless servers which had been compromised by the national spy agency, according to Edward
[01:20:47.100 --> 01:20:48.100]   Snowden.
[01:20:48.100 --> 01:20:49.660]   And the response of these engineers.
[01:20:49.660 --> 01:20:52.460]   Well first Eric Schmidt says that's outrageous, right?
[01:20:52.460 --> 01:20:58.740]   And then the response to these engineers was, "F you, NSA."
[01:20:58.740 --> 01:21:00.380]   About time we get to that anger.
[01:21:00.380 --> 01:21:08.180]   Brandon Downey and Mike Hearn writing on Google+ talking about this.
[01:21:08.180 --> 01:21:12.700]   F these guys was Brandon Downey's pithy phrase.
[01:21:12.700 --> 01:21:17.300]   I've spent the last 10 years of my life trying to keep Google users safe and secure from the
[01:21:17.300 --> 01:21:19.900]   many diverse threats Google faces.
[01:21:19.900 --> 01:21:22.660]   I've seen armies of machines dossing Google.
[01:21:22.660 --> 01:21:26.940]   I've seen worms dossing Google to find vulnerabilities in other people's software.
[01:21:26.940 --> 01:21:29.540]   I've seen criminal gangs figure out malware.
[01:21:29.540 --> 01:21:34.580]   I've seen spyware masquerading as toolbars so thick it breaks computers because it interferes
[01:21:34.580 --> 01:21:36.300]   with the other spyware.
[01:21:36.300 --> 01:21:40.980]   I've even seen oppressive governments use state sponsored hacking to target dissidents.
[01:21:40.980 --> 01:21:44.860]   But even though we suspected this was happening, it still makes me terribly sad.
[01:21:44.860 --> 01:21:48.500]   It makes me sad because I believe in America.
[01:21:48.500 --> 01:21:53.100]   After spending all that time helping in my tiny way to protect Google, one of the greatest
[01:21:53.100 --> 01:21:57.180]   things to arise from the internet seeing this well, it's just a little like coming home from
[01:21:57.180 --> 01:22:02.540]   war with Sauron destroying the one ring only to discover that the NSA is on the front porch
[01:22:02.540 --> 01:22:06.740]   of the shire chopping down the party tree and outsourcing all the hobbit farmers with
[01:22:06.740 --> 01:22:08.340]   half works and whips.
[01:22:08.340 --> 01:22:14.540]   So, what's suitably geeky reference there?
[01:22:14.540 --> 01:22:18.660]   The US has to be better than this, but I guess in the interim that security job is looking
[01:22:18.660 --> 01:22:23.460]   a lot more like a Sisyphian thing than ever before.
[01:22:23.460 --> 01:22:31.020]   So what Google's response to this besides the salty phrases is to now encrypt that data
[01:22:31.020 --> 01:22:34.500]   on those least servers and encrypt every possible data.
[01:22:34.500 --> 01:22:35.500]   It's between the servers.
[01:22:35.500 --> 01:22:36.500]   Yeah.
[01:22:36.500 --> 01:22:37.500]   Every possible data transport.
[01:22:37.500 --> 01:22:40.660]   You know, once it gets to the public internet, well, what can you do?
[01:22:40.660 --> 01:22:42.140]   But they're encrypting everything they can.
[01:22:42.140 --> 01:22:43.140]   We're going to need suspects yet.
[01:22:43.140 --> 01:22:44.140]   Is it level three?
[01:22:44.140 --> 01:22:45.980]   Is it what kind of companies?
[01:22:45.980 --> 01:22:46.980]   I don't know.
[01:22:46.980 --> 01:22:47.980]   Do you know that Kevin?
[01:22:47.980 --> 01:22:48.980]   Who this is?
[01:22:48.980 --> 01:22:54.020]   It wasn't clear, but I think that it needs to be an overseas connection for it to be
[01:22:54.020 --> 01:22:57.100]   allegedly legitimate for the NSA.
[01:22:57.100 --> 01:23:00.020]   So it's probably one of the connections between the different overseas data centers.
[01:23:00.020 --> 01:23:02.860]   And this is, you know, part of the thing, one of the things that Google does with a lot
[01:23:02.860 --> 01:23:06.940]   of the data is replicate it between data centers, different countries as the ultimate
[01:23:06.940 --> 01:23:07.940]   backup.
[01:23:07.940 --> 01:23:12.980]   That was one of the things that they had that was before Gmail could lose the beta label.
[01:23:12.980 --> 01:23:16.420]   It had to make sure all the data was backed up in more than one country.
[01:23:16.420 --> 01:23:19.500]   So this is a significant thing for Google.
[01:23:19.500 --> 01:23:21.860]   Lots of the data is moved between countries in this way.
[01:23:21.860 --> 01:23:24.980]   So in effect, they would have slurped out a lot of the transactions.
[01:23:24.980 --> 01:23:26.780]   So is it replication?
[01:23:26.780 --> 01:23:27.780]   It's replication?
[01:23:27.780 --> 01:23:28.780]   Yeah.
[01:23:28.780 --> 01:23:31.660]   It looks like replication is what they're tapping into it.
[01:23:31.660 --> 01:23:34.300]   Mike Hearn, who's British, says, I'm not an American.
[01:23:34.300 --> 01:23:35.740]   I'm a Brit, but it's no different.
[01:23:35.740 --> 01:23:41.860]   The C.H.Q., the British NSA, basically, turns out to be even worse than the NSA.
[01:23:41.860 --> 01:23:44.580]   We designed this system to keep criminals out.
[01:23:44.580 --> 01:23:46.300]   There's no ambiguity here.
[01:23:46.300 --> 01:23:51.220]   The warrant system with skeptical judges, paths for appeal and rules of evidence was
[01:23:51.220 --> 01:23:53.740]   built from centuries of hard one experience.
[01:23:53.740 --> 01:23:57.820]   When it works, it represents as good a balance as we've got between the need to restrain
[01:23:57.820 --> 01:24:01.860]   the state and the need to keep crime and check.
[01:24:01.860 --> 01:24:07.100]   By passing that system is illegal for a good reason.
[01:24:07.100 --> 01:24:09.500]   He says, thank you, Edward Snowden, for me personally.
[01:24:09.500 --> 01:24:14.100]   This is the most interesting revelation all summer.
[01:24:14.100 --> 01:24:16.740]   I'm glad that Google is allowing its engineers.
[01:24:16.740 --> 01:24:21.100]   They both say we're not speaking for Google here, but allowing its engineers to speak
[01:24:21.100 --> 01:24:22.380]   out.
[01:24:22.380 --> 01:24:27.700]   These are two of the guys whose job it was to keep prying eyes from this data.
[01:24:27.700 --> 01:24:35.380]   It's particularly jarring and I'm sure insulting and annoying to them that the US government
[01:24:35.380 --> 01:24:40.220]   is doing this or their own government, in this case of the G.H.Q.
[01:24:40.220 --> 01:24:41.620]   Schmidt said it's outrageous.
[01:24:41.620 --> 01:24:44.580]   These guys spoke a little more.
[01:24:44.580 --> 01:24:48.380]   All the security guys are really, really grumpy about this.
[01:24:48.380 --> 01:24:49.700]   It's not okay.
[01:24:49.700 --> 01:24:51.580]   It's not okay.
[01:24:51.580 --> 01:24:54.580]   There's aren't people who want to get grumpy.
[01:24:54.580 --> 01:25:00.700]   There's not much they can do except encrypt everything, which is, I presume, now with the
[01:25:00.700 --> 01:25:03.540]   encrypt your replication servers.
[01:25:03.540 --> 01:25:11.140]   By 4-1 early adopters, pick wearable watches over glasses.
[01:25:11.140 --> 01:25:17.380]   Not that either one is really yet ready for prime time.
[01:25:17.380 --> 01:25:24.340]   Do we care about this rock star lawsuit against Google, Microsoft, an Apple, Outbid Google,
[01:25:24.340 --> 01:25:29.260]   bid $4.5 billion for the Nortell patents?
[01:25:29.260 --> 01:25:30.700]   Turned out that wasn't enough.
[01:25:30.700 --> 01:25:36.580]   A consortium composed of Microsoft, Apple, RIM, Ericsson and Sony operating under the
[01:25:36.580 --> 01:25:46.180]   name Rockstar Bidco beat the Google bid and now they're using those patents against Google.
[01:25:46.180 --> 01:25:51.100]   At the time they said they were buying them as defensive measures to do a licensing for
[01:25:51.100 --> 01:25:55.860]   all a blah, blah, blah, blah, but now they've set up a patent-rolled entity as Rockstar
[01:25:55.860 --> 01:25:59.060]   and they filed lawsuits against anyone running Android.
[01:25:59.060 --> 01:26:01.220]   There's two clumps of lawsuits.
[01:26:01.220 --> 01:26:07.020]   There's one against every handset manufacturer with a bunch of patents on bullshit things
[01:26:07.020 --> 01:26:14.260]   like the most shocking bullshit one was one that said screens are too small.
[01:26:14.260 --> 01:26:18.900]   We need to have a way of scrolling over a small screen.
[01:26:18.900 --> 01:26:25.580]   Therefore, here's an idea for a floating cursor that you click on on top of the screen.
[01:26:25.580 --> 01:26:30.740]   In the preamble it says computers now have large screens that are 640x480 pixels.
[01:26:30.740 --> 01:26:34.340]   That's how old this patent is.
[01:26:34.340 --> 01:26:39.100]   That's how old that patent is and how unlike any actual working thing it is, but they're
[01:26:39.100 --> 01:26:42.980]   using that as part of the chain of going after all the phone people.
[01:26:42.980 --> 01:26:50.980]   We've got another chain of patents that are a patent on searching a search index and searching
[01:26:50.980 --> 01:26:56.460]   and advertising index at the same time and displaying them side by side.
[01:26:56.460 --> 01:27:00.260]   Which is like, well, that seems like a really obvious idea to anyone who's seen a search
[01:27:00.260 --> 01:27:04.460]   engine ever, but because it was before Google has founded they're using that and the whole
[01:27:04.460 --> 01:27:08.900]   chain of ready ones to go after Google and say, "You can't do that."
[01:27:08.900 --> 01:27:13.580]   So it's a gigantic part of a tax again.
[01:27:13.580 --> 01:27:16.740]   If there were ever a question whether they're patent trolls, they're doing all the things
[01:27:16.740 --> 01:27:17.740]   patent trolls do.
[01:27:17.740 --> 01:27:22.180]   They've got an office in Ottawa, Canada where they have 10 reverse engineers going through
[01:27:22.180 --> 01:27:26.180]   every product they can find looking for somebody to sue.
[01:27:26.180 --> 01:27:31.100]   They file these suits in the Eastern District of Texas where both the judges and the juries
[01:27:31.100 --> 01:27:34.420]   are very much in favor of plaintiffs.
[01:27:34.420 --> 01:27:36.220]   Can't believe this end.
[01:27:36.220 --> 01:27:37.220]   She's.
[01:27:37.220 --> 01:27:38.220]   Isn't it sad?
[01:27:38.220 --> 01:27:41.100]   I think we do little fiber in Eastern, for instance, why Eastern Texas?
[01:27:41.100 --> 01:27:44.620]   I think that will be a really small move.
[01:27:44.620 --> 01:27:46.460]   Yes.
[01:27:46.460 --> 01:27:53.060]   What I was told by some is that not only the judges are very proplative in these, but the
[01:27:53.060 --> 01:27:55.980]   juries because it's essentially fairly poor.
[01:27:55.980 --> 01:28:04.060]   It's bedrock, Godfearing, hard scramble types is that they don't like big companies.
[01:28:04.060 --> 01:28:09.900]   So if you can position yourself, this is why the way it's not Microsoft suing Google,
[01:28:09.900 --> 01:28:14.220]   if you can position yourself as a little guy who had an invention going up against the big
[01:28:14.220 --> 01:28:17.500]   guy, they'll almost always rule in favor of the little guy.
[01:28:17.500 --> 01:28:18.500]   Right.
[01:28:18.500 --> 01:28:21.780]   But I got to show how that works for this set of patent laws which were naughtales patent
[01:28:21.780 --> 01:28:23.620]   law that's been bought by a consortium of companies.
[01:28:23.620 --> 01:28:25.100]   But they position it.
[01:28:25.100 --> 01:28:27.660]   That's why Interval never uses its own name.
[01:28:27.660 --> 01:28:29.100]   They position it.
[01:28:29.100 --> 01:28:32.020]   The lawyer says, listen here is Mike Smith.
[01:28:32.020 --> 01:28:39.460]   He invented back in 1997 a way to find advertisements in the database and match them to search.
[01:28:39.460 --> 01:28:42.860]   You see, he just wanted to make a little money on the side and long comes Google.
[01:28:42.860 --> 01:28:48.260]   Now we've asked Google to license his patent, but Google just says, no, they basically outright
[01:28:48.260 --> 01:28:49.740]   stole it from Mike.
[01:28:49.740 --> 01:28:53.460]   And I think you ought to give Mike some money.
[01:28:53.460 --> 01:28:56.060]   And the jury says, yes, sir.
[01:28:56.060 --> 01:29:03.300]   Yeah, with really some better story set on the, on the, I know far too much about this
[01:29:03.300 --> 01:29:04.300]   story.
[01:29:04.300 --> 01:29:05.300]   I don't want to.
[01:29:05.300 --> 01:29:11.020]   And Kevin knows that.
[01:29:11.020 --> 01:29:12.020]   Let us move on.
[01:29:12.020 --> 01:29:15.220]   I think it's time for a tool, a tip, a number, all of that stuff.
[01:29:15.220 --> 01:29:16.220]   Let's start with, huh?
[01:29:16.220 --> 01:29:17.220]   Oh, yes.
[01:29:17.220 --> 01:29:20.860]   I always do this and I apologize.
[01:29:20.860 --> 01:29:25.460]   If there is a story you would like to talk about, please go ahead, Kevin.
[01:29:25.460 --> 01:29:30.620]   So Samsung have just had their analysts meeting announced a whole bunch of upcoming things.
[01:29:30.620 --> 01:29:35.700]   They've also invented the term funblet, which is their term for the things, you know, the
[01:29:35.700 --> 01:29:38.260]   dislike things that aren't quite phones and aren't quite tablets.
[01:29:38.260 --> 01:29:40.180]   There's charge backs in back of you, by the way.
[01:29:40.180 --> 01:29:42.180]   He's spying on you.
[01:29:42.180 --> 01:29:44.460]   He's got his steady cam on.
[01:29:44.460 --> 01:29:50.140]   But they've, what they've announced is they've, they've, they said they're going to ship
[01:29:50.140 --> 01:29:52.780]   even higher resolution smartphone displays.
[01:29:52.780 --> 01:29:56.060]   Two five 60 by 1440 next year.
[01:29:56.060 --> 01:30:00.660]   And then 40 by 2, 2, 1, 0, 6 in 2000.
[01:30:00.660 --> 01:30:02.500]   Is there demand for this?
[01:30:02.500 --> 01:30:05.780]   Not how do you do that at this site?
[01:30:05.780 --> 01:30:10.260]   Is it they ship with like a, you know, I, on this one, if I take my glass off and hold
[01:30:10.260 --> 01:30:14.220]   it really close, I still can't see the pixels, but I can, you know, it's got as many pages
[01:30:14.220 --> 01:30:15.220]   as an X or seven.
[01:30:15.220 --> 01:30:17.860]   Well, it is Moore's law, right?
[01:30:17.860 --> 01:30:22.220]   Just as power processors, or the number of transistors and processor doubles every 18
[01:30:22.220 --> 01:30:23.220]   seconds.
[01:30:23.220 --> 01:30:26.260]   It's presumed that these displays, the, the pixel size can get smaller and smaller and
[01:30:26.260 --> 01:30:27.260]   smaller.
[01:30:27.260 --> 01:30:30.540]   But there's the question is, and this is, I guess what you're saying, if you can't see
[01:30:30.540 --> 01:30:31.900]   it, what does it matter?
[01:30:31.900 --> 01:30:32.900]   Right.
[01:30:32.900 --> 01:30:36.420]   But, you know, I'm not sure why we'd want to do it.
[01:30:36.420 --> 01:30:39.940]   Well, the only thing may be so that then you can plug it into external screens because
[01:30:39.940 --> 01:30:43.420]   you can have a personal screen by then that would make a bit of sense.
[01:30:43.420 --> 01:30:49.100]   Or maybe, or maybe, um, it has to do with sub pixel rendering, that kind of thing.
[01:30:49.100 --> 01:30:51.100]   So the, you get CRISPR fonts.
[01:30:51.100 --> 01:30:53.340]   So the fonts look pretty good to me right now.
[01:30:53.340 --> 01:30:55.340]   Any CRISPR than this.
[01:30:55.340 --> 01:30:56.340]   That's pretty grim.
[01:30:56.340 --> 01:31:06.780]   1080p, you know, 2000 by 1000 on a five inch screen is pretty insanely crisp.
[01:31:06.780 --> 01:31:09.260]   There's enough sub pixels for any renderer.
[01:31:09.260 --> 01:31:11.060]   There's a dumb question.
[01:31:11.060 --> 01:31:12.820]   No, I'm never, I just love these things.
[01:31:12.820 --> 01:31:14.660]   I just got this.
[01:31:14.660 --> 01:31:15.660]   Sorry.
[01:31:15.660 --> 01:31:17.580]   I just got this phone.
[01:31:17.580 --> 01:31:21.300]   And I got a new Mac Pro with the written display.
[01:31:21.300 --> 01:31:23.140]   So, and I've already had the Nexus 7.
[01:31:23.140 --> 01:31:27.780]   So all my screens have not, and they, and they Chromebook pixel.
[01:31:27.780 --> 01:31:30.620]   So now all my screens have higher resolution than I can actually see.
[01:31:30.620 --> 01:31:31.620]   Right.
[01:31:31.620 --> 01:31:36.700]   I even got new glasses this week so that I could actually focus, focus better.
[01:31:36.700 --> 01:31:38.380]   I've got, I've got, you know, that's it.
[01:31:38.380 --> 01:31:40.780]   Think of the optometrists.
[01:31:40.780 --> 01:31:42.940]   It's an optometrist support rule.
[01:31:42.940 --> 01:31:43.940]   I think it's good.
[01:31:43.940 --> 01:31:45.340]   It was actually quite funny.
[01:31:45.340 --> 01:31:46.900]   I went into the optometrists.
[01:31:46.900 --> 01:31:49.020]   And they said, can you, can you read this bit of paper?
[01:31:49.020 --> 01:31:52.420]   And I said, well, you know, can I read this instead?
[01:31:52.420 --> 01:31:57.620]   I'm actually going to be reading.
[01:31:57.620 --> 01:31:59.540]   Can I actually check it against this rather than?
[01:31:59.540 --> 01:32:01.260]   Yeah, I can't think of any.
[01:32:01.260 --> 01:32:06.660]   They should work on color gamut color accuracy, brightness.
[01:32:06.660 --> 01:32:09.340]   I don't know if sub, you know, the size of the pixels is really.
[01:32:09.340 --> 01:32:11.140]   Well, even more pixels is an easy thing to do.
[01:32:11.140 --> 01:32:12.140]   Well, it's not easy.
[01:32:12.140 --> 01:32:14.140]   It's actually hard thing to do, but it's an obvious thing to do.
[01:32:14.140 --> 01:32:15.140]   And they'll keep doing that.
[01:32:15.140 --> 01:32:16.300]   It's the same with the cameras.
[01:32:16.300 --> 01:32:17.580]   The cameras got more and more megapixels.
[01:32:17.580 --> 01:32:20.820]   And they said, oh, we're making these sensor things too small now.
[01:32:20.820 --> 01:32:26.500]   And wouldn't be nice to back off a bit and get some better
[01:32:26.500 --> 01:32:30.300]   ability to capture more photons and give you better nighttime stuff.
[01:32:30.300 --> 01:32:36.180]   Or, oh, we should, we can, I can actually do what you call it,
[01:32:36.180 --> 01:32:38.820]   better dynamic range so that you can do the things you'd
[01:32:38.820 --> 01:32:40.740]   have to take multiple shot exposures with before.
[01:32:40.740 --> 01:32:44.180]   So I suspect that the screen things may end up being the same.
[01:32:44.180 --> 01:32:46.780]   But one of the interesting things for me is that it does
[01:32:46.780 --> 01:32:48.540]   change the design dynamic again.
[01:32:48.540 --> 01:32:52.380]   So the design dynamic we've had for the past five years has been,
[01:32:52.380 --> 01:32:53.820]   oh, you should--
[01:32:53.820 --> 01:32:57.220]   first, it was you need to define a mobile version of your site.
[01:32:57.220 --> 01:33:01.020]   And then it was, oh, you've got to design a responsive version
[01:33:01.020 --> 01:33:02.660]   of the site that works on both.
[01:33:02.660 --> 01:33:04.580]   And then it was, oh, you've designed mobile first,
[01:33:04.580 --> 01:33:05.980]   because most people are mobile.
[01:33:05.980 --> 01:33:11.220]   But that design center there has moved from you've got a 320
[01:33:11.220 --> 01:33:14.060]   by 480 pixel thing that's this big
[01:33:14.060 --> 01:33:15.180]   to I've got a--
[01:33:15.180 --> 01:33:19.140]   this screen that has more pixels than the last laptop I had.
[01:33:19.140 --> 01:33:20.180]   And it's this big.
[01:33:20.180 --> 01:33:22.580]   Oh, and all my other devices are getting me super high-risk
[01:33:22.580 --> 01:33:27.660]   screens as well, which means that instead of saying, oh, I just
[01:33:27.660 --> 01:33:30.580]   need to put more and more bigger bitmaps in,
[01:33:30.580 --> 01:33:32.060]   gets less and less viable.
[01:33:32.060 --> 01:33:37.540]   And I should just use SVG and use vector fonts and use things
[01:33:37.540 --> 01:33:41.060]   that naturally scale much more in my designs.
[01:33:41.060 --> 01:33:42.620]   It starts making more and more sense.
[01:33:42.620 --> 01:33:44.460]   So I think that's going to be an interesting iteration
[01:33:44.460 --> 01:33:46.260]   as these screens roll out.
[01:33:46.260 --> 01:33:48.540]   We'll start seeing people doing designs
[01:33:48.540 --> 01:33:50.380]   that are much more print-like because they can actually
[01:33:50.380 --> 01:33:51.300]   be rendered for a change.
[01:33:51.300 --> 01:33:53.540]   And it'll be like the Edward Toughbooks,
[01:33:53.540 --> 01:33:55.580]   where he has those ridiculous hairline things
[01:33:55.580 --> 01:34:00.100]   that are conveying huge amounts of information in tiny spaces.
[01:34:00.100 --> 01:34:01.820]   But they're actually viable on these screens now.
[01:34:01.820 --> 01:34:02.420]   Right.
[01:34:02.420 --> 01:34:04.460]   Isn't that nice?
[01:34:04.460 --> 01:34:08.140]   Any other stories before we get our tip of the week?
[01:34:08.140 --> 01:34:09.700]   Quick one.
[01:34:09.700 --> 01:34:11.980]   We talked about how there was some backlash
[01:34:11.980 --> 01:34:15.900]   against Chrome for not prompting you to enter your system
[01:34:15.900 --> 01:34:18.780]   password before you could look at your saved passwords.
[01:34:18.780 --> 01:34:20.500]   And the Chromium engineers were like, look,
[01:34:20.500 --> 01:34:22.500]   if someone can get into your Chrome settings,
[01:34:22.500 --> 01:34:24.060]   then what's the point?
[01:34:24.060 --> 01:34:25.860]   That's just sort of like security theater.
[01:34:25.860 --> 01:34:27.020]   Well, they backed down.
[01:34:27.020 --> 01:34:30.420]   And they've actually added a flag into Chromium.
[01:34:30.420 --> 01:34:33.180]   This is a Chromium build for Mac that
[01:34:33.180 --> 01:34:35.980]   will prompt you for your system, your Mac password,
[01:34:35.980 --> 01:34:38.380]   before when you go when to save passwords and say,
[01:34:38.380 --> 01:34:41.500]   show me a password, it'll mimic the behavior of Safari.
[01:34:41.500 --> 01:34:43.980]   So it's interesting back pedaling going on there.
[01:34:43.980 --> 01:34:46.780]   It's currently in Canary too now.
[01:34:46.780 --> 01:34:50.980]   So that means it will almost certainly make it into the final--
[01:34:50.980 --> 01:34:52.300]   In the final build, yep.
[01:34:52.300 --> 01:34:53.780]   Yeah.
[01:34:53.780 --> 01:34:54.220]   Good point.
[01:34:54.220 --> 01:34:56.140]   Yeah, we talked about that on security now as well.
[01:34:56.140 --> 01:34:58.980]   I guess we knew this would happen.
[01:34:58.980 --> 01:35:01.860]   They justified it, and they justified it in a sensible way.
[01:35:01.860 --> 01:35:03.500]   But why not put a password in?
[01:35:03.500 --> 01:35:04.340]   It doesn't hurt.
[01:35:04.340 --> 01:35:05.380]   Yeah, it doesn't hurt.
[01:35:05.380 --> 01:35:06.060]   Right.
[01:35:06.060 --> 01:35:08.700]   It does just sort of give you the feeling of that it's secure.
[01:35:08.700 --> 01:35:09.220]   Yeah.
[01:35:09.220 --> 01:35:10.580]   Security theater is--
[01:35:10.580 --> 01:35:11.900]   still a good thing.
[01:35:11.900 --> 01:35:13.100]   Yeah.
[01:35:13.100 --> 01:35:15.500]   It's just theater, but who doesn't love theater?
[01:35:15.500 --> 01:35:17.180]   It works the TSA, so you know.
[01:35:17.180 --> 01:35:18.580]   Yeah, there you go.
[01:35:18.580 --> 01:35:22.020]   Hey, what is your tip of the week, Gina?
[01:35:22.020 --> 01:35:23.900]   So my tip is actually--
[01:35:23.900 --> 01:35:25.060]   it's a new gadget that I bought.
[01:35:25.060 --> 01:35:26.340]   I talked about this on the show a while.
[01:35:26.340 --> 01:35:29.180]   This is a Kickstarter that I backed a long time ago,
[01:35:29.180 --> 01:35:30.860]   and I just shipped in the mail this week.
[01:35:30.860 --> 01:35:34.300]   This is the most useful thing I've ever bought on Kickstarter.
[01:35:34.300 --> 01:35:36.340]   It's the Fluxma Bolt.
[01:35:36.340 --> 01:35:38.580]   It is a charger for your devices.
[01:35:38.580 --> 01:35:41.260]   The USB charger is a USB port right here.
[01:35:41.260 --> 01:35:43.660]   But it's also an external battery.
[01:35:43.660 --> 01:35:46.140]   I shouldn't say an external battery, but a portable charger.
[01:35:46.140 --> 01:35:49.500]   So Jeff, when you and Leo and I were at Google I/O this year,
[01:35:49.500 --> 01:35:53.740]   my phone died, and you saved my bacon with the Mophie Juice
[01:35:53.740 --> 01:35:56.740]   pack, this is just like that, but it also
[01:35:56.740 --> 01:35:58.660]   acts like a standard charger.
[01:35:58.660 --> 01:36:00.300]   So I just kind of-- I wanted to kind of show it off.
[01:36:00.300 --> 01:36:02.380]   So you keep it plugged in, and then how much juice does it
[01:36:02.380 --> 01:36:04.420]   have in there?
[01:36:04.420 --> 01:36:08.220]   It will charge your device or it charges my HTC One fully.
[01:36:08.220 --> 01:36:11.380]   Once it's fully charged, it's portable, which is really nice.
[01:36:11.380 --> 01:36:14.740]   You can also charge your iPad, your iPhone.
[01:36:14.740 --> 01:36:17.460]   I also got the little three-prong charger thing.
[01:36:17.460 --> 01:36:18.980]   So you just plug it in.
[01:36:18.980 --> 01:36:22.660]   But you can use whatever cord comes with your device.
[01:36:22.660 --> 01:36:25.940]   But I love this thing because it basically replaced my charger.
[01:36:25.940 --> 01:36:28.380]   But also, when I'm on the go, I could just grab it out
[01:36:28.380 --> 01:36:29.620]   of the wall, throw it in my bag.
[01:36:29.620 --> 01:36:32.740]   I don't need to carry my charger and an external charger.
[01:36:32.740 --> 01:36:33.980]   It's all kind of all in one.
[01:36:33.980 --> 01:36:34.980]   So I really dig it.
[01:36:34.980 --> 01:36:36.220]   I recommend it.
[01:36:36.220 --> 01:36:38.620]   And they're for sale at the FluxMob site now,
[01:36:38.620 --> 01:36:39.660]   at foxmob.com.
[01:36:39.660 --> 01:36:40.500]   It's a few bucks.
[01:36:40.500 --> 01:36:41.380]   You want to check it out?
[01:36:41.380 --> 01:36:45.220]   It's a fairly hefty battery, 3,000 milliamp hours,
[01:36:45.220 --> 01:36:47.100]   which is a decent sized battery that's
[01:36:47.100 --> 01:36:49.060]   bigger than the battery in your phone.
[01:36:49.060 --> 01:36:49.580]   Yeah.
[01:36:49.580 --> 01:36:52.940]   It's not as big as the battery in this son of a gun.
[01:36:52.940 --> 01:36:56.900]   This is Chad's anchored giant battery.
[01:36:56.900 --> 01:37:02.020]   It's got 20,000 milliamp hours in it.
[01:37:02.020 --> 01:37:03.940]   Yeah, but you know who wants to carry that around?
[01:37:03.940 --> 01:37:04.540]   It weighs a pound of--
[01:37:04.540 --> 01:37:05.220]   Well, that's the thing.
[01:37:05.220 --> 01:37:06.940]   Yeah, I'm going to carry a charger around.
[01:37:06.940 --> 01:37:07.700]   This is--
[01:37:07.700 --> 01:37:08.200]   Yeah.
[01:37:08.200 --> 01:37:08.820]   Yeah, it does both.
[01:37:08.820 --> 01:37:09.020]   And it's like--
[01:37:09.020 --> 01:37:09.740]   3,000 is good.
[01:37:09.740 --> 01:37:12.420]   That is a full charge for almost any phone on the market.
[01:37:12.420 --> 01:37:13.020]   Yep.
[01:37:13.020 --> 01:37:13.620]   Yep.
[01:37:13.620 --> 01:37:14.980]   Yeah, and I don't know these guys.
[01:37:14.980 --> 01:37:17.100]   I happened to back them because a friend of mine did.
[01:37:17.100 --> 01:37:19.140]   And it was one of those things where it finally came.
[01:37:19.140 --> 01:37:19.980]   And I was like, yay.
[01:37:19.980 --> 01:37:20.660]   And then tried it out.
[01:37:20.660 --> 01:37:22.340]   And the thing I don't like is that you have to turn it on.
[01:37:22.340 --> 01:37:25.020]   I sort of expected that you could just plug in your device
[01:37:25.020 --> 01:37:25.580]   and it would work.
[01:37:25.580 --> 01:37:27.700]   But you turn it on and it tells you how much juice is in there.
[01:37:27.700 --> 01:37:30.580]   You can see it's got an indicator, kind of like what's on the Mac.
[01:37:30.580 --> 01:37:31.140]   And--
[01:37:31.140 --> 01:37:33.620]   What did you pay as a backer, you know?
[01:37:33.620 --> 01:37:34.740]   Remember?
[01:37:34.740 --> 01:37:35.700]   What's that?
[01:37:35.700 --> 01:37:37.260]   What did you pay as a backer, yeah?
[01:37:37.260 --> 01:37:38.380]   Oh, that's a good question.
[01:37:38.380 --> 01:37:39.580]   I think I paid like 50 bucks.
[01:37:39.580 --> 01:37:41.100]   I think I got 10 minutes off.
[01:37:41.100 --> 01:37:43.860]   I'm at the site, and I went to buy now,
[01:37:43.860 --> 01:37:45.540]   but there's no actual--
[01:37:45.540 --> 01:37:47.900]   You mouse over the pieces and all--
[01:37:47.900 --> 01:37:48.940]   Oh, my god.
[01:37:48.940 --> 01:37:50.780]   Can you hide that better for me?
[01:37:50.780 --> 01:37:51.540]   I know.
[01:37:51.540 --> 01:37:53.260]   That was not--
[01:37:53.260 --> 01:37:54.940]   What?
[01:37:54.940 --> 01:37:57.180]   So there's the Argon, the graphite, and the stealth.
[01:37:57.180 --> 01:37:57.940]   They're all 60 bucks.
[01:37:57.940 --> 01:37:59.700]   That's just different colors, I guess.
[01:37:59.700 --> 01:38:00.940]   Yeah, there's a just--
[01:38:00.940 --> 01:38:01.420]   Exactly.
[01:38:01.420 --> 01:38:02.420]   I'm checking to see--
[01:38:02.420 --> 01:38:04.340]   You know, they really got to work on the web design.
[01:38:04.340 --> 01:38:05.900]   That's not good.
[01:38:05.900 --> 01:38:08.500]   I can't-- if you didn't hover over, you would say, well,
[01:38:08.500 --> 01:38:09.860]   OK, it says buy.
[01:38:09.860 --> 01:38:12.620]   I don't-- where?
[01:38:12.620 --> 01:38:17.980]   I don't normally just hover my mouse over strange objects.
[01:38:17.980 --> 01:38:20.220]   Over strange objects.
[01:38:20.220 --> 01:38:22.820]   Yeah, I think I paid you 30, 40, or 50 bucks.
[01:38:22.820 --> 01:38:23.780]   I don't remember which.
[01:38:23.780 --> 01:38:27.420]   It's a stealth purchase feature.
[01:38:27.420 --> 01:38:30.700]   There's too much design and web design isn't there.
[01:38:30.700 --> 01:38:32.260]   Yeah, you think?
[01:38:32.260 --> 01:38:34.180]   Jeff, your number of the week.
[01:38:34.180 --> 01:38:36.540]   Well, let's go with this one, because this news is fairly
[01:38:36.540 --> 01:38:39.100]   current.
[01:38:39.100 --> 01:38:42.140]   Dish, which bought Blockbuster, just closed--
[01:38:42.140 --> 01:38:45.340]   now it's closing the last 300 Blockbuster stores.
[01:38:45.340 --> 01:38:46.380]   Oh, it's over.
[01:38:46.380 --> 01:38:47.820]   You've existed.
[01:38:47.820 --> 01:38:50.660]   Nine years ago, there were 9,000.
[01:38:50.660 --> 01:38:51.860]   Whoa!
[01:38:51.860 --> 01:38:53.220]   There were 9,000.
[01:38:53.220 --> 01:38:54.140]   There are 300.
[01:38:54.140 --> 01:38:56.180]   They're going to be zero.
[01:38:56.180 --> 01:38:56.860]   Yes.
[01:38:56.860 --> 01:39:01.980]   Even though they rented DVDs, it wasn't just VCRs, VHS tapes.
[01:39:01.980 --> 01:39:04.180]   That's sad.
[01:39:04.180 --> 01:39:09.820]   Today on Howard Stern's show, Sal the stockbroker, Sal
[01:39:09.820 --> 01:39:15.820]   Governor Nally went into Craigslist and read particularly
[01:39:15.820 --> 01:39:17.140]   wacky things there.
[01:39:17.140 --> 01:39:18.860]   And one thing that says something about--
[01:39:18.860 --> 01:39:20.900]   I'll meet you at the video store.
[01:39:20.900 --> 01:39:22.180]   And Rob McQuiver said, video stores.
[01:39:22.180 --> 01:39:23.580]   There's no video stores anymore.
[01:39:23.580 --> 01:39:24.420]   Or Howard dead.
[01:39:24.420 --> 01:39:27.380]   And Robyn said, yeah, there are for porn.
[01:39:27.380 --> 01:39:30.820]   I don't even know why that exists, because if you visit my
[01:39:30.820 --> 01:39:32.860]   new Google help out--
[01:39:32.860 --> 01:39:34.460]   Exactly.
[01:39:34.460 --> 01:39:37.060]   You won't need a pair of porn.
[01:39:37.060 --> 01:39:38.700]   I'm telling you.
[01:39:38.700 --> 01:39:39.700]   Huge.
[01:39:39.700 --> 01:39:43.700]   It'll be huge.
[01:39:43.700 --> 01:39:45.020]   OK.
[01:39:45.020 --> 01:39:46.020]   OK.
[01:39:46.020 --> 01:39:49.620]   Do you have anything, Kevin, that you'd like to share with us?
[01:39:49.620 --> 01:39:53.460]   Well, I have a set of bad jokes I made the other night,
[01:39:53.460 --> 01:39:57.620]   which is all Google products need to end in outs now.
[01:39:57.620 --> 01:40:01.140]   So we've got Google Ventures becomes Google handouts.
[01:40:01.140 --> 01:40:03.140]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:40:03.140 --> 01:40:05.100]   I like it.
[01:40:05.100 --> 01:40:06.060]   I like it.
[01:40:06.060 --> 01:40:07.260]   Is Google Printouts?
[01:40:07.260 --> 01:40:09.740]   Right.
[01:40:09.740 --> 01:40:10.780]   I'm going to say I have.
[01:40:10.780 --> 01:40:13.060]   Google 20% time is Google Layabouts.
[01:40:13.060 --> 01:40:13.900]   Layabouts.
[01:40:13.900 --> 01:40:15.900]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:40:15.900 --> 01:40:17.300]   This is a good new parlor game.
[01:40:17.300 --> 01:40:18.300]   I like it.
[01:40:18.300 --> 01:40:20.940]   Google Maps Directions is Google Gadabouts.
[01:40:20.940 --> 01:40:22.940]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:40:22.940 --> 01:40:23.940]   What else have I got?
[01:40:23.940 --> 01:40:26.300]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:40:26.300 --> 01:40:28.260]   Oh, and when they act with higher people,
[01:40:28.260 --> 01:40:29.820]   they use Google Sellouts.
[01:40:29.820 --> 01:40:31.660]   Sellouts?
[01:40:31.660 --> 01:40:32.500]   Wow.
[01:40:32.500 --> 01:40:33.980]   I think there's going to be more.
[01:40:33.980 --> 01:40:35.420]   Email them to Kevin.
[01:40:35.420 --> 01:40:37.340]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:40:37.340 --> 01:40:39.620]   Kevin Marks, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:40:39.620 --> 01:40:42.340]   Oh, my tip is-- so when I'm setting up--
[01:40:42.340 --> 01:40:43.940]   it's not-- I don't have a tool today.
[01:40:43.940 --> 01:40:47.420]   I was setting up Twitter on the new Nexus 5.
[01:40:47.420 --> 01:40:51.260]   And I really apologize to each and every one of you
[01:40:51.260 --> 01:40:53.660]   for sending you at least one, in some cases,
[01:40:53.660 --> 01:40:58.060]   but it has eight emails inviting you to join Twitter.
[01:40:58.060 --> 01:40:59.460]   Oh, no.
[01:40:59.460 --> 01:41:01.180]   The app desperately wants you to do that.
[01:41:01.180 --> 01:41:02.740]   Desperately wants you to do that.
[01:41:02.740 --> 01:41:03.660]   I got to show you.
[01:41:03.660 --> 01:41:06.620]   It is way too easy, way too easy.
[01:41:06.620 --> 01:41:11.140]   So just a word of warning the next time you set up Twitter,
[01:41:11.140 --> 01:41:13.140]   you'll automatically be brought to the who
[01:41:13.140 --> 01:41:14.900]   to follow and find friends.
[01:41:14.900 --> 01:41:16.820]   We will securely upload your contacts
[01:41:16.820 --> 01:41:18.980]   to help you find friends and suggest users.
[01:41:18.980 --> 01:41:20.340]   They should be a little more clear that we
[01:41:20.340 --> 01:41:22.820]   will be storing that contact list forever.
[01:41:22.820 --> 01:41:24.820]   And if anybody should ever break into our servers,
[01:41:24.820 --> 01:41:26.820]   they'll have access to it too.
[01:41:26.820 --> 01:41:28.740]   But OK, I'm-- well, I have a nice guy.
[01:41:28.740 --> 01:41:29.980]   I'm going to click OK.
[01:41:29.980 --> 01:41:30.940]   There's some matches.
[01:41:30.940 --> 01:41:34.980]   I don't really want to follow those people, or maybe I did.
[01:41:34.980 --> 01:41:35.460]   I'm done.
[01:41:35.460 --> 01:41:35.940]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:41:35.940 --> 01:41:36.700]   Here's another page.
[01:41:36.700 --> 01:41:38.260]   Invite friends.
[01:41:38.260 --> 01:41:40.060]   1,400 to 31 contacts.
[01:41:40.060 --> 01:41:41.100]   Oh, they're all checked.
[01:41:41.100 --> 01:41:41.940]   But you know what?
[01:41:41.940 --> 01:41:44.220]   I'm just going to say done because I don't really want
[01:41:44.220 --> 01:41:45.180]   to do that.
[01:41:45.180 --> 01:41:49.900]   If you click that done as I did, all 1,000--
[01:41:49.900 --> 01:41:52.940]   and by the way, it doesn't just mail 1 to each contact.
[01:41:52.940 --> 01:41:56.780]   It mails 1 to each address I have in the contact book for you.
[01:41:56.780 --> 01:41:57.940]   Oh, fuck.
[01:41:57.940 --> 01:41:58.940]   Oh, yeah.
[01:41:58.940 --> 01:42:00.420]   Ouch.
[01:42:00.420 --> 01:42:03.020]   And the default is all selected.
[01:42:03.020 --> 01:42:03.020]   Yeah.
[01:42:03.020 --> 01:42:04.500]   [INAUDIBLE]
[01:42:04.500 --> 01:42:05.820]   Of course it is.
[01:42:05.820 --> 01:42:08.060]   My mailing list got spammed with people
[01:42:08.060 --> 01:42:11.500]   in writing the mailing list to Twitter, my open source
[01:42:11.500 --> 01:42:14.580]   mailing list, because apparently it was in people's contact
[01:42:14.580 --> 01:42:16.540]   lists, and they did that, exactly.
[01:42:16.540 --> 01:42:18.100]   I mean, who wouldn't press done there?
[01:42:18.100 --> 01:42:19.820]   Done means I'm done.
[01:42:19.820 --> 01:42:21.540]   And it doesn't give you a warning, OK, we're
[01:42:21.540 --> 01:42:23.140]   going to email everybody or anything.
[01:42:23.140 --> 01:42:24.620]   It just-- you're done.
[01:42:24.620 --> 01:42:28.860]   Done meant invite every person you gushed or know.
[01:42:28.860 --> 01:42:31.140]   My mom, I felt so bad.
[01:42:31.140 --> 01:42:33.420]   Said, well, I joined Twitter.
[01:42:33.420 --> 01:42:34.980]   Where are your pictures?
[01:42:34.980 --> 01:42:35.980]   Oh.
[01:42:35.980 --> 01:42:36.980]   Oh.
[01:42:36.980 --> 01:42:38.460]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:42:38.460 --> 01:42:40.300]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:42:40.300 --> 01:42:42.260]   That's so cool.
[01:42:42.260 --> 01:42:45.740]   There really should be an-- are you sure you want to send 1,433
[01:42:45.740 --> 01:42:47.100]   emails right now?
[01:42:47.100 --> 01:42:48.820]   It's unacceptable.
[01:42:48.820 --> 01:42:52.420]   And if I could tank Twitter's IPO right now, I would.
[01:42:52.420 --> 01:42:55.620]   So what do you think of stocks that close out tomorrow?
[01:42:55.620 --> 01:42:57.420]   When is it start?
[01:42:57.420 --> 01:42:57.900]   Tomorrow.
[01:42:57.900 --> 01:42:59.460]   Tomorrow's the day?
[01:42:59.460 --> 01:43:00.060]   Yeah, tomorrow's the day.
[01:43:00.060 --> 01:43:05.020]   Nobody should buy Twitter stock ever, ever, ever.
[01:43:05.020 --> 01:43:06.780]   Is that yet your official recommendation?
[01:43:06.780 --> 01:43:09.740]   I am not a registered stock advisor.
[01:43:09.740 --> 01:43:13.700]   I don't have any standing for which to tell you this.
[01:43:13.700 --> 01:43:14.980]   You can do it on Google Helpouts, though.
[01:43:14.980 --> 01:43:15.900]   You can say--
[01:43:15.900 --> 01:43:17.220]   Here's a helpout.
[01:43:17.220 --> 01:43:18.500]   That's the name of my helpout.
[01:43:18.500 --> 01:43:22.580]   Why you should never, ever, ever buy stock in Twitter.
[01:43:22.580 --> 01:43:25.980]   What they're saying, $17 to $20, was the range they predicted.
[01:43:25.980 --> 01:43:27.340]   I think they went up, I think.
[01:43:27.340 --> 01:43:28.340]   They went up?
[01:43:28.340 --> 01:43:30.980]   Of course, I'm sure it'll be very hot, right?
[01:43:30.980 --> 01:43:34.700]   Because people like my mom go, oh, I love that Twitter.
[01:43:34.700 --> 01:43:38.580]   I'm going to buy some stock with my hard-earned dollars that
[01:43:38.580 --> 01:43:42.780]   are all I have left now that I'm in retirement.
[01:43:42.780 --> 01:43:45.460]   Let me put my money into these tech stocks.
[01:43:45.460 --> 01:43:48.340]   I hit techs a good thing.
[01:43:48.340 --> 01:43:49.340]   I keep getting emails from them.
[01:43:49.340 --> 01:43:51.740]   They're trying Twitter, so they must be good.
[01:43:51.740 --> 01:43:54.620]   They want the $27 million.
[01:43:54.620 --> 01:43:55.500]   But you know, they're not--
[01:43:55.500 --> 01:43:59.060]   I mean, that only values them at what, $18 billion.
[01:43:59.060 --> 01:44:00.060]   That's all I got.
[01:44:00.060 --> 01:44:02.380]   $19 billion.
[01:44:02.380 --> 01:44:02.900]   $19.
[01:44:02.900 --> 01:44:04.580]   And they've yet to figure out a way to monetize.
[01:44:04.580 --> 01:44:06.540]   But that's not important.
[01:44:06.540 --> 01:44:09.020]   That's not what's important here.
[01:44:09.020 --> 01:44:11.820]   It's your chance to get into this fast and exciting new
[01:44:11.820 --> 01:44:13.580]   technology business.
[01:44:13.580 --> 01:44:16.780]   Social media is all the rage.
[01:44:16.780 --> 01:44:19.700]   Oh, well, I'm sure I'm violating SEC rules by the minute,
[01:44:19.700 --> 01:44:21.180]   so I should probably just shut up now.
[01:44:21.180 --> 01:44:25.180]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:44:25.180 --> 01:44:27.540]   Their penetration is still small enough.
[01:44:27.540 --> 01:44:30.300]   I wonder if they're not beatable.
[01:44:30.300 --> 01:44:31.060]   Oh, gosh, yes.
[01:44:31.060 --> 01:44:35.340]   Any social media network is-- any social media is beatable.
[01:44:35.340 --> 01:44:36.260]   Any social media is beatable.
[01:44:36.260 --> 01:44:37.660]   My face taught us that.
[01:44:37.660 --> 01:44:43.100]   There's plenty of lessons learned.
[01:44:43.100 --> 01:44:45.580]   Yeah, an AOL instant messenger, another classic.
[01:44:45.580 --> 01:44:48.020]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:44:48.020 --> 01:44:49.540]   Just remember--
[01:44:49.540 --> 01:44:50.380]   I see Q.
[01:44:50.380 --> 01:44:52.500]   I see Q. That's the one I was going to mention.
[01:44:52.500 --> 01:44:55.340]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:44:55.340 --> 01:44:57.940]   I think Facebook might be-- no, maybe not.
[01:44:57.940 --> 01:44:59.500]   You know what we're going to ask?
[01:44:59.500 --> 01:45:01.420]   Robert Scoble and Shell Israel next,
[01:45:01.420 --> 01:45:05.180]   because there are next victims on triangulation
[01:45:05.180 --> 01:45:06.260]   in just a few minutes.
[01:45:06.260 --> 01:45:08.340]   Their new book, Age of Context, just came out.
[01:45:08.340 --> 01:45:12.060]   Kevin Marks, thank you so much from salesforce.com.
[01:45:12.060 --> 01:45:12.980]   He's been at BT.
[01:45:12.980 --> 01:45:13.820]   He's been at Google.
[01:45:13.820 --> 01:45:14.540]   He's been at Apple.
[01:45:14.540 --> 01:45:17.380]   He's been everywhere.
[01:45:17.380 --> 01:45:19.020]   More than Johnny Cash.
[01:45:19.020 --> 01:45:19.540]   Thank you.
[01:45:19.540 --> 01:45:20.900]   I'm not at salesforce anymore.
[01:45:20.900 --> 01:45:22.300]   I've left salesforce this month.
[01:45:22.300 --> 01:45:23.300]   Well, there you go.
[01:45:23.300 --> 01:45:24.820]   Where are you now?
[01:45:24.820 --> 01:45:27.260]   I am now independent and--
[01:45:27.260 --> 01:45:28.820]   Are you looking for work?
[01:45:28.820 --> 01:45:31.180]   Are you looking for work?
[01:45:31.180 --> 01:45:32.820]   Well, I'm not sure about looking for work.
[01:45:32.820 --> 01:45:34.900]   I'm looking for what to do next, which is slightly different
[01:45:34.900 --> 01:45:35.740]   where framing it.
[01:45:35.740 --> 01:45:36.540]   Yeah, no.
[01:45:36.540 --> 01:45:37.900]   There's some things I want to make.
[01:45:37.900 --> 01:45:38.540]   Let's put it that way.
[01:45:38.540 --> 01:45:40.820]   At this point in your career, you don't need a job.
[01:45:40.820 --> 01:45:43.860]   You need an adventure.
[01:45:43.860 --> 01:45:44.420]   There we go.
[01:45:44.420 --> 01:45:47.780]   Maybe you should join the army.
[01:45:47.780 --> 01:45:49.060]   Kevin Marks, great to talk to you.
[01:45:49.060 --> 01:45:52.060]   Tell them all vision.tv at Kevin Marks on that thing.
[01:45:52.060 --> 01:45:53.620]   That sounds like a bird tweeting.
[01:45:53.620 --> 01:45:55.820]   Thank you.
[01:45:55.820 --> 01:45:56.900]   He's also a Google player.
[01:45:56.900 --> 01:46:00.260]   I can see Kevin with a hard hat and one
[01:46:00.260 --> 01:46:03.260]   of those writing crops right now.
[01:46:03.260 --> 01:46:04.340]   What is it?
[01:46:04.340 --> 01:46:04.820]   I'm sorry.
[01:46:04.820 --> 01:46:06.460]   Steeble Chase, is that what you're suggesting?
[01:46:06.460 --> 01:46:07.660]   What is he doing?
[01:46:07.660 --> 01:46:08.140]   What?
[01:46:08.140 --> 01:46:09.780]   What am I doing?
[01:46:09.780 --> 01:46:10.780]   Writing crops.
[01:46:10.780 --> 01:46:12.100]   He's got a whip and a hard hat.
[01:46:12.100 --> 01:46:13.100]   I don't.
[01:46:13.100 --> 01:46:14.500]   It could be almost anything at this point.
[01:46:14.500 --> 01:46:15.780]   I see him with Inja.
[01:46:15.780 --> 01:46:16.780]   And Ninja.
[01:46:16.780 --> 01:46:17.540]   And Ninja.
[01:46:17.540 --> 01:46:18.540]   He's a ninja.
[01:46:18.540 --> 01:46:21.260]   And Ninja for Open Standards.
[01:46:21.260 --> 01:46:21.700]   There we go.
[01:46:21.700 --> 01:46:22.700]   Open Standards.
[01:46:22.700 --> 01:46:24.260]   That's what I'll put on my Google account.
[01:46:24.260 --> 01:46:24.740]   This is card.
[01:46:24.740 --> 01:46:25.940]   Yeah, Open Standards Ninja.
[01:46:25.940 --> 01:46:27.620]   I like it.
[01:46:27.620 --> 01:46:30.660]   Well, I went to the-- what are they called?
[01:46:30.660 --> 01:46:32.660]   Neo launch thing last night.
[01:46:32.660 --> 01:46:34.420]   They've just bought a big building in San Francisco, which
[01:46:34.420 --> 01:46:38.220]   is owned by Digital Garage from Japan.
[01:46:38.220 --> 01:46:42.060]   And they bought Neo, which is a roll-up of a developer house.
[01:46:42.060 --> 01:46:44.700]   But they've done this huge over-the-top presentation
[01:46:44.700 --> 01:46:46.100]   of all this Japanese stuff.
[01:46:46.100 --> 01:46:48.700]   One of the things they had was a video showing
[01:46:48.700 --> 01:46:51.020]   the East East East West thing, which
[01:46:51.020 --> 01:46:54.100]   was a samurai on a horse, an American Indian on a horse,
[01:46:54.100 --> 01:46:56.300]   and a cowboy on a horse.
[01:46:56.300 --> 01:46:59.380]   And I could dress Irish lady on a horse, all like merging
[01:46:59.380 --> 01:47:02.700]   and crossing the planes together.
[01:47:02.700 --> 01:47:05.500]   And this was their symbolic.
[01:47:05.500 --> 01:47:07.060]   We're bringing the East and West together things.
[01:47:07.060 --> 01:47:08.580]   It was very odd.
[01:47:08.580 --> 01:47:12.020]   So I think I know where those ninjas are here.
[01:47:12.020 --> 01:47:15.420]   They support clients with Lean UX design.
[01:47:15.420 --> 01:47:18.300]   That's all I had to read.
[01:47:18.300 --> 01:47:21.980]   They're the ones who invented the hover over it and click
[01:47:21.980 --> 01:47:24.460]   to find out how to buy this.
[01:47:24.460 --> 01:47:26.660]   I want to thank Jeff Jarvis from the City University
[01:47:26.660 --> 01:47:28.500]   of New York, where he teaches journalism to a bunch
[01:47:28.500 --> 01:47:30.820]   of children who don't deserve him.
[01:47:30.820 --> 01:47:32.300]   He's also the author of What Would Google
[01:47:32.300 --> 01:47:35.260]   Do in His Latest Public Parts, available in bookstores
[01:47:35.260 --> 01:47:35.940]   everywhere.
[01:47:35.940 --> 01:47:37.540]   And his blog is Buzzmachine.com.
[01:47:37.540 --> 01:47:38.940]   Thank you, Jeffrey.
[01:47:38.940 --> 01:47:40.380]   Thank you.
[01:47:40.380 --> 01:47:42.380]   Gina Trapani is at smartawear.org.
[01:47:42.380 --> 01:47:46.020]   But more importantly, she's raising money for ThinkUp.
[01:47:46.020 --> 01:47:49.580]   If you go to ThinkUp.com, it's not too late to be a funder
[01:47:49.580 --> 01:47:52.100]   in the early stages.
[01:47:52.100 --> 01:47:52.660]   It's not.
[01:47:52.660 --> 01:47:55.420]   In fact, we reached our goal of 1,000--
[01:47:55.420 --> 01:47:56.420]   Pan-- yes.
[01:47:56.420 --> 01:47:57.420]   --by the congratulations.
[01:47:57.420 --> 01:47:58.700]   Yeah, we're really excited about.
[01:47:58.700 --> 01:48:01.820]   And we've got our first stretch goal, 2,000 followers.
[01:48:01.820 --> 01:48:03.700]   And if you missed the early bird rate,
[01:48:03.700 --> 01:48:06.660]   we have just posted, literally, like right before the show,
[01:48:06.660 --> 01:48:10.340]   a late bird rate for procrastinators.
[01:48:10.340 --> 01:48:11.980]   Because we really want to--
[01:48:11.980 --> 01:48:13.620]   Do you have a dirty bird rate?
[01:48:13.620 --> 01:48:14.900]   Because that's the one I--
[01:48:14.900 --> 01:48:16.900]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:48:16.900 --> 01:48:18.900]   You are hard to--
[01:48:18.900 --> 01:48:21.740]   So if 2,000 more people, right?
[01:48:21.740 --> 01:48:23.460]   Or no, if you get to 2,000 people--
[01:48:23.460 --> 01:48:24.540]   Yeah, we get to 2,000 people.
[01:48:24.540 --> 01:48:26.940]   By November 15, which is a week from now,
[01:48:26.940 --> 01:48:30.900]   every member gets a code for a free year of ThinkUp
[01:48:30.900 --> 01:48:32.340]   to give to a friend.
[01:48:32.340 --> 01:48:34.060]   Yeah, coupon code for a free year.
[01:48:34.060 --> 01:48:35.180]   So we got to reach that.
[01:48:35.180 --> 01:48:36.380]   We got 10 days left.
[01:48:36.380 --> 01:48:38.860]   We got to reach that 2,000 in order for that to happen.
[01:48:38.860 --> 01:48:39.380]   That's awesome.
[01:48:39.380 --> 01:48:41.940]   But if you're thinking about joining me and Mr. Early Bird,
[01:48:41.940 --> 01:48:42.900]   you can grab late bird.
[01:48:42.900 --> 01:48:45.100]   It's only $50 a year.
[01:48:45.100 --> 01:48:46.980]   There is a bug in the front page of the website, which
[01:48:46.980 --> 01:48:48.740]   I'm going to fix as soon as I hang up.
[01:48:48.740 --> 01:48:49.700]   It's a throbbing.
[01:48:49.700 --> 01:48:51.140]   It's a throbbing bug.
[01:48:51.140 --> 01:48:52.020]   It is a throbbing bug.
[01:48:52.020 --> 01:48:54.300]   And Leo, I wanted to thank you.
[01:48:54.300 --> 01:48:57.300]   Steve Martin actually agreed to be interviewed for the book
[01:48:57.300 --> 01:48:58.020]   that we're putting together--
[01:48:58.020 --> 01:48:58.420]   Awesome.
[01:48:58.420 --> 01:48:59.460]   --about social media.
[01:48:59.460 --> 01:49:01.780]   Yeah, so we just published his interview.
[01:49:01.780 --> 01:49:04.260]   A blog, that ThinkUp.com is Steve Martin's interview
[01:49:04.260 --> 01:49:05.420]   about how we use social media.
[01:49:05.420 --> 01:49:07.540]   And then we're actually compiling all these interviews.
[01:49:07.540 --> 01:49:10.180]   We're doing some amazing people into an e-book,
[01:49:10.180 --> 01:49:12.460]   which you also get if you back the campaign.
[01:49:12.460 --> 01:49:16.020]   Steve Martin, Fred Wilson, Timo, Riley, Juliana Rotich,
[01:49:16.020 --> 01:49:16.900]   Chelsea Peretti.
[01:49:16.900 --> 01:49:18.060]   This is good.
[01:49:18.060 --> 01:49:19.260]   I want my book.
[01:49:19.260 --> 01:49:20.260]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:49:20.260 --> 01:49:23.540]   Who did the interview with Steve?
[01:49:23.540 --> 01:49:26.140]   I actually reached out to him because he used ThinkUp
[01:49:26.140 --> 01:49:29.420]   to put together his book of tweets way back a few years ago
[01:49:29.420 --> 01:49:30.420]   because you intro'd me.
[01:49:30.420 --> 01:49:31.180]   A year ago.
[01:49:31.180 --> 01:49:32.180]   Not that one.
[01:49:32.180 --> 01:49:34.300]   Yeah, yeah, a year ago.
[01:49:34.300 --> 01:49:35.700]   So yeah, he was very gracious.
[01:49:35.700 --> 01:49:39.460]   We did the interview over email.
[01:49:39.460 --> 01:49:40.580]   He was absolutely wonderful.
[01:49:40.580 --> 01:49:42.420]   So really, really, full to have him.
[01:49:42.420 --> 01:49:44.180]   He's a very, very neat guy.
[01:49:44.180 --> 01:49:48.860]   His book, though, the worst name for a book ever--
[01:49:48.860 --> 01:49:50.220]   no, seriously.
[01:49:50.220 --> 01:49:53.020]   If you want to buy it, good luck finding it.
[01:49:53.020 --> 01:49:57.060]   The 10 make that nine habits of very organized people
[01:49:57.060 --> 01:49:59.700]   make that 10, the tweets of Steve Martin.
[01:49:59.700 --> 01:50:02.940]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:50:02.940 --> 01:50:04.460]   That's the name.
[01:50:04.460 --> 01:50:05.740]   He became the best seller.
[01:50:05.740 --> 01:50:06.820]   So there you go.
[01:50:06.820 --> 01:50:08.900]   It should be a best seller.
[01:50:08.900 --> 01:50:09.380]   Good.
[01:50:09.380 --> 01:50:11.020]   All right, think up.com.
[01:50:11.020 --> 01:50:13.060]   It's not too late to be a late bird.
[01:50:13.060 --> 01:50:15.180]   By the way, I just want to point out, late birds pay the same
[01:50:15.180 --> 01:50:16.420]   as early birds.
[01:50:16.420 --> 01:50:17.580]   Yeah, late birds pay the same.
[01:50:17.580 --> 01:50:19.620]   So it's not like you're at a disadvantage.
[01:50:19.620 --> 01:50:20.780]   Because we love procrastinating.
[01:50:20.780 --> 01:50:22.020]   We understand procrastinating.
[01:50:22.020 --> 01:50:22.500]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:50:22.500 --> 01:50:23.300]   They're programmers.
[01:50:23.300 --> 01:50:25.220]   Of course they do.
[01:50:25.220 --> 01:50:27.580]   Juliana also blogs at smarterword.org when she's not
[01:50:27.580 --> 01:50:29.900]   programming, which is never so don't look for a blog post
[01:50:29.900 --> 01:50:31.300]   anytime in the near future.
[01:50:31.300 --> 01:50:32.220]   Thank you, Leo.
[01:50:32.220 --> 01:50:34.180]   That's true.
[01:50:34.180 --> 01:50:36.540]   And her other-- if she didn't have enough to do,
[01:50:36.540 --> 01:50:40.500]   her other project is to do text todotxt.com.
[01:50:40.500 --> 01:50:45.380]   A great little to-do list for the iPhone and Android devices.
[01:50:45.380 --> 01:50:46.100]   Thank you.
[01:50:46.100 --> 01:50:47.660]   Thank you, everybody, for joining us.
[01:50:47.660 --> 01:50:51.980]   We do this show 1 p.m. Pacific, 4 p.m. Eastern Time 2100 UTC.
[01:50:51.980 --> 01:50:53.180]   Right here on twit.tv.
[01:50:53.180 --> 01:50:56.380]   Watching live is always good for the soul.
[01:50:56.380 --> 01:50:58.300]   But if you can't watch live, don't worry.
[01:50:58.300 --> 01:50:59.660]   All the swear words are taken out.
[01:50:59.660 --> 01:51:01.540]   And you can download the expregated,
[01:51:01.540 --> 01:51:06.820]   bowdlerized, dare I say, version of this show at twit.tv/twig.
[01:51:06.820 --> 01:51:10.060]   I bet you Jeff and maybe Kevin, probably the only person
[01:51:10.060 --> 01:51:13.900]   who knows who bowdler was.
[01:51:13.900 --> 01:51:15.900]   Kevin.
[01:51:15.900 --> 01:51:17.180]   I'm Nate.
[01:51:17.180 --> 01:51:20.660]   He was a minister, wasn't he?
[01:51:20.660 --> 01:51:22.220]   Was he a publisher?
[01:51:22.220 --> 01:51:27.540]   I think he did like, ex-fagated versions of--
[01:51:27.540 --> 01:51:28.060]   Shakespeare.
[01:51:28.060 --> 01:51:30.020]   He published the family Shakespeare.
[01:51:30.020 --> 01:51:31.020]   Yes.
[01:51:31.020 --> 01:51:32.700]   Do Shakespeare without the naughty bits?
[01:51:32.700 --> 01:51:36.300]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:51:36.300 --> 01:51:40.980]   That's what you get if you listen to the audio or video
[01:51:40.980 --> 01:51:41.980]   downloads of this show.
[01:51:41.980 --> 01:51:45.700]   You get the family version of Shakespeare.
[01:51:45.700 --> 01:51:48.300]   And that's available at twit.tv/twig or wherever
[01:51:48.300 --> 01:51:49.180]   you get your podcast.
[01:51:49.180 --> 01:51:49.900]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:51:49.900 --> 01:51:52.420]   We'll see you next Wednesday on This Week in Cool.
[01:51:52.420 --> 01:51:53.420]   Bye-bye.
[01:51:53.420 --> 01:51:56.380]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:51:56.380 --> 01:51:59.740]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:51:59.740 --> 01:52:02.320]   (upbeat music)
[01:52:02.320 --> 01:52:03.820]   [Music]
