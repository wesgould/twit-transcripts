[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.600]   to show the covers the latest in the Google and the cloud
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.760]   and joining us here from the cloud.
[00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:39.920]   Actually, from TNT, Becky Warley is here.
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.720]   She was our reporter at the Logitech event.
[00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.000]   We'll report in live, because you are live right now.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   Right.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.240]   It's also confusing.
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.080]   Am I DVR'd?
[00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.000]   Can someone pause me?
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.560]   You're recorded.
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:51.760]   Unpause, Becky.
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:55.760]   Also here as usual, Gina Tarpani from San Diego.
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:56.760]   Hello, Gina.
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:57.760]   Gina?
[00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:58.260]   Hi.
[00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:59.080]   Good to be here.
[00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:00.520]   Excited to talk about Google TV.
[00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.080]   Yeah, smartaware.org is her website.
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:04.840]   And of course, she writes for Fast Company.
[00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.040]   It has a great work smart feature.
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:09.040]   It's at fastcompany.com/worksmart.
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:10.840]   Jeff Jarvis back from Frankfurt.
[00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.400]   You were there last night.
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.640]   20 hours.
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:14.120]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.620]   Yay.
[00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:15.800]   Got umber.
[00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.200]   And the ambient didn't work according to your Twitter.
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.440]   No, I was really pissed.
[00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.840]   I was awake.
[00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.480]   And there's a terrible thing to be as awake.
[00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:26.920]   Well, are you jet lag still?
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.360]   Oh, no, I'm just stupid.
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.640]   OK.
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:32.400]   I'm not going to say anything.
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.400]   I was going to say something.
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.480]   I'm eager to talk about Google.
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:35.680]   And we got lots of Facebook news.
[00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.440]   We got new Google tours.
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.920]   And you know who's been covering it from his command center
[00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.480]   in San Francisco, MG Sinclair.
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:44.760]   TechCrunch.com.
[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:45.520]   Love MG.
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.880]   We're all big fans of yours, MG.
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:48.400]   Thank you.
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.160]   Thank you guys.
[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.920]   Good to be here.
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.640]   And you-- so you actually didn't go to any of the events,
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.560]   because they were all going on at once.
[00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.720]   There was a Cisco event.
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:56.960]   There was a Facebook event.
[00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.560]   And there was a Logitech event all in the same morning,
[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.320]   all in the Bay Area.
[00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:02.200]   Yeah.
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.520]   Couldn't pick one to go to.
[00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.160]   So I kind of watched the stream and the live blogs.
[00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.320]   We had people at them all, you know,
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.200]   so I was watching live blogs.
[00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.600]   And I watched the live stream of the Facebook event itself.
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.200]   Well, let's-- I guess we should--
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.160]   you know what we should do is quickly cover the Cisco
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.240]   and Facebook announcements.
[00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.280]   Since they're quick, there's not a lot to say about them.
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.920]   And we're going to spend a lot more time, I think,
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.520]   with the Google TV Logitech announcement.
[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:25.960]   Start with Facebook, MG.
[00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.080]   What did Facebook tell us today?
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:33.000]   So Facebook basically, they rolled out a few new features.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.160]   So one of them, the big one, one of the big ones
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.440]   is data portability type deal, where
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.440]   they're going to allow you to kind of export all your data,
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.680]   finally, from Facebook itself.
[00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.840]   And they're not really disclosing where you can move it to yet,
[00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.120]   but you'll basically be able to get a big file dump with all
[00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.520]   this data, including your pictures and all that kind of stuff.
[00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:53.720]   That's something we talked about with backup of Fy,
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.480]   that I'm already doing with a third party service.
[00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.360]   But Facebook, actually, I think wasn't too happy about backup
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:03:59.880]   of Fy.
[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:00.640]   So I said, they're off.
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.040]   I mean, people have been trying to do this, obviously,
[00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:02.760]   for a long time.
[00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.840]   And there's been a lot of talk that people
[00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:06.640]   want to get this data out of Facebook
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.720]   since everyone is putting so much data into it.
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:10.360]   And it looks like they're finally doing it.
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:12.920]   Dave recording, it sounds like it's leading this charge.
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.640]   He was the one who talked about it today.
[00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.840]   And yeah, I mean, they're saying all the right things now.
[00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.080]   We'll see how it's actually implemented.
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.880]   That makes sense, Dave.
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.840]   Would you stay there for a second?
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.240]   And Gina, too, I want to hear.
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.360]   So if I can get my Facebook data, then I presume
[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.880]   that this now means that independent app developers
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.240]   can develop independent apps for me to publish and display
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.640]   my data to the web alone or with others and all kinds of new
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:35.440]   and wacky ways.
[00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:36.960]   That's interesting.
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.200]   It doesn't-- from what I understand,
[00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:41.120]   it gets up-- you download it as HTML.
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.200]   So it's this big, kind of giant HTML package.
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.440]   So that's not JSON or XML, which is much more machine
[00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.840]   readable, but it certainly is programmatically readable.
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.160]   So yes, you could do that.
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:56.600]   It would be nice for it to export to an XML or JSON file.
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.760]   So that would be a little easier to import.
[00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:00.440]   Do you think that's why they used HTML
[00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.800]   is to kind of discourage you from doing stuff with it?
[00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.720]   I think they use HTML because it makes
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:07.720]   sense to a regular user who double clicks on the zip file
[00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:08.920]   and clicks on the indexation.
[00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:10.360]   Oh, and then you get a browser--
[00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.520]   Yeah, you get a simplified version that you can look at.
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.320]   So I think that makes sense to the normal user.
[00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.240]   The un-normal user would look at a bunch of XML files
[00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:17.360]   and say, what is this?
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.920]   I would love to see--
[00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:21.800]   I mean, honestly, the graph API is fantastic.
[00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.840]   It exposes all the data via JSON anyway.
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.120]   So developers are getting that, right?
[00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.520]   So this is really for regular users.
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.200]   And what's cool about this, too, is that you get all the photos
[00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.320]   that you have been tagged in.
[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:33.360]   It's not just photos that you've uploaded.
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:35.320]   So that's really useful.
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:36.760]   From what I understand that that's true.
[00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.720]   So I think this is just for regular users who say,
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:40.760]   I want to back up my Facebook.
[00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:42.000]   And this is an easy way to do it.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.240]   And I think it makes a lot of sense.
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.000]   And I was really, really happy to hear this.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:45.640]   Because this is--
[00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:47.120]   But is it more than that potential?
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.600]   --a little bit like an update?
[00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:52.240]   I mean, imagine making apps out of this?
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:53.840]   Yes, yeah, definitely.
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:55.800]   And because it's HTML, you can read it in.
[00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.400]   You can make apps out of this.
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:01.440]   It signals this sort of cultural shift at Facebook.
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.080]   I mean, this is kind of feels like an about face.
[00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.240]   I mean, they've always been accused of being kind of this wall
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.480]   garden, and your stuff is there, and it can't go anywhere else.
[00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:10.640]   I feel like this is a response to diaspora on some level.
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:12.120]   And when we talk about groups, I think
[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:14.560]   that's a response to the rumors about Google Me.
[00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:16.800]   But I also think it's like, oh, this guy, David,
[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:19.640]   was instrumental in building OAuth and OpenID.
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:21.360]   He's a head of open source at Facebook.
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.360]   Like, we have a lot of Googlers going over to Facebook.
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:26.400]   I think we're starting to see Facebook start to show some
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:28.800]   of the values that we're really used to hearing from Google.
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.840]   So I'm really happy about this.
[00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.200]   Yeah, you really have to thank Dave for this.
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:34.800]   I totally agree with that, obviously.
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.280]   But there's also--
[00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:38.640]   there's still a little bit of a lot of gray area
[00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:40.520]   and what they're going to do with all this stuff.
[00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.720]   It's like they still have the kind of weird relationship
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:44.560]   with Twitter and the weird relationship with Google
[00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:46.960]   when it comes to actually importing this data.
[00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:48.920]   I've heard that they basically want
[00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:52.560]   to have deals in place with any company over a certain size
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:56.480]   in terms of bringing in just even the friend graph and that.
[00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:59.560]   So while I'm sure they'd be OK with people exporting their data
[00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.680]   and maybe using it in some little small startup
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:04.040]   or doing something like that, if someone tried to pull this
[00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.840]   into Google Me or pull this into Twitter,
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:07.480]   I think that Facebook would still--
[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:08.080]   Hold on, I'm joking.
[00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:09.040]   Hold on.
[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:11.760]   If I download it and it's now mine,
[00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:14.880]   you come along and you say, hey, sailor, put it here
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:17.240]   and look at the neat things we'll do to it, that's up to me.
[00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:19.880]   Otherwise, Facebook can't stop me from doing something
[00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:22.880]   with my data once I've downloaded it, which they've enabled.
[00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:24.040]   Yes, true.
[00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:26.840]   They're not scraping it out of Facebook.
[00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:28.600]   For me, what's cool about that is it
[00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:34.760]   goes to the idea of me being the server of my identity.
[00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:36.400]   Well, think about somebody like Tumblr.
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:38.640]   Tumblr could then say, OK, great.
[00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:40.640]   Download your Facebook file.
[00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:43.680]   Put it on Tumblr, and now you've got your own website
[00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:45.080]   with your Facebook content on it.
[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:46.720]   Which is actually good for Facebook, I think,
[00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:49.120]   because you use it as an offering tool for your identity,
[00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:50.880]   which is goes to what you've been talking about, Leo,
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:54.200]   in terms of what Google Profiles could be, which I think
[00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:57.600]   may be part of the reason that they're doing it.
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:59.480]   Is because it's also a shot across--
[00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:00.600]   They had to.
[00:08:00.600 --> 00:08:02.440]   Profiles before Profiles comes out.
[00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:04.000]   Definitely.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.360]   At the most basic level, I think
[00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:07.680]   that the most basic function of any software program
[00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:09.720]   should be, I can get out the data that I put in.
[00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:11.600]   So as far as I'm concerned, this export, my data,
[00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:13.760]   is like, whatever, six years.
[00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:17.440]   That's the Google Day liberation front point.
[00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:17.960]   Definitely.
[00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:21.000]   And what's so interesting is that if the social network,
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.480]   the movie, which I did see, if it's true--
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:24.880]   I mean, this is how Facebook started.
[00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:27.440]   Zuck went and sucked down all the photos from--
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:28.240]   Open directories.
[00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:29.400]   --I'll hold different Facebooks around Harvard,
[00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:30.600]   and then created face match.
[00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:32.080]   It's WGet.
[00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:33.440]   I used WGet, right?
[00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:35.200]   But now he's giving everybody the ability
[00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:37.720]   to pull down their own pictures, their own data.
[00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:41.080]   And I think it's a long time in coming, and a really good idea.
[00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:42.280]   And Jeff's point is right.
[00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:44.080]   If you hand over your Facebook zip file
[00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:47.480]   to another program, just the way you export your bookmarks
[00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:49.360]   from one browser and import them into another,
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:51.760]   I can't see how Facebook could argue with that.
[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:52.960]   That's great news.
[00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:53.560]   They also--
[00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:54.640]   I think this is huge news.
[00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:57.040]   Yeah, I think this is really maybe the most important story
[00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:02.400]   of the day, because it does change the whole architecture
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:04.400]   of how we can handle identity.
[00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:06.240]   I had lunch by chance that, slash,
[00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:09.160]   week with Brett Taylor, who's the CTO at Facebook now,
[00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:12.080]   of course, former friend feed, great guy, Sky.
[00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:16.240]   And what I hear from them is that they struggle about--
[00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:17.880]   the way the privacy thing comes out--
[00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:19.680]   I was going to write a post about this,
[00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:20.760]   but I'll say it here first.
[00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:22.440]   I think the positioning for Facebook
[00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:25.280]   is that it is a sharing service.
[00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:26.720]   You go to Facebook to share.
[00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:28.560]   You don't go to Facebook to hide.
[00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:29.600]   You go to Facebook to share.
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:31.720]   And now with groups of MGM, sure we'll
[00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:35.200]   follow that on in a second, you can share with a small group.
[00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:37.200]   You can share with the whole world.
[00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:38.680]   It's all about control.
[00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:41.440]   And this gives us another level of control.
[00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:44.040]   I think what's brilliant about it is that if I do choose
[00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:46.360]   to download a role and I do choose to publish a role,
[00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:48.040]   I've done that independent of Facebook,
[00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:50.360]   because it's no longer Facebook's fault
[00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:53.640]   if I broadcast the world.
[00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:55.800]   So tell us about Google Groups, Becky.
[00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:58.720]   Well, I was just going to ask MJ, because I looked at it--
[00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:00.720]   Google Groups, I'm sorry, Facebook groups.
[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:03.440]   So I've got a lot of ourselves.
[00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:03.960]   Yeps.
[00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:04.800]   You can't help yourself.
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:05.680]   They're all becoming one.
[00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:08.040]   And I just crucially looked at it.
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:09.720]   And I don't understand the difference
[00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:11.840]   between this groups and the previous groups.
[00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:13.480]   MJ, can you explain that?
[00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:13.920]   Yeah.
[00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:14.240]   OK.
[00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:17.280]   So Groups is the big consumer-facing feature
[00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:18.080]   that they launched today.
[00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:20.960]   So it's kind of like creating a new environment
[00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:23.120]   within Facebook itself, where you can easily
[00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:25.560]   add any person that's already in your social graph
[00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:27.800]   and just put them in this new group area
[00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:28.960]   and share anything with them.
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:31.120]   You can even-- they have a new feature where you can share a doc
[00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:32.200]   and kind of edit it.
[00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:33.400]   It's very basic.
[00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:35.280]   But you've heard privately to that group.
[00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:38.720]   Is that based on the docs.com Microsoft solution
[00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:40.200]   that they offered a while ago?
[00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:41.040]   No, I don't think so.
[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:43.280]   I think this is just totally an internal thing.
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:45.400]   It's a very simple document that you can just kind of group
[00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:46.680]   edit together if you want.
[00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:48.960]   I mean, the thing that this actually most reminds me of
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:50.160]   is actually Google Wave.
[00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:50.560]   I know--
[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:52.760]   Oh, wouldn't that be awesome if they--
[00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:53.280]   [BEEP]
[00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:54.640]   --brought Wave back?
[00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:55.560]   It's kind of like it.
[00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:57.480]   It's not as technologically advanced.
[00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:59.640]   There's not all the real-time typing and all that stuff.
[00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:03.320]   But in some ways, this might be Facebook saying, hey,
[00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:05.000]   Google, this is what you should have done with Wave
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.480]   if you really want to make this a collaborative environment
[00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:07.960]   type deal.
[00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:08.880]   I'm not seeing it yet.
[00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:10.680]   So how's this rolling out?
[00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:12.520]   They're rolling out over the next few weeks, I think.
[00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:14.200]   They enabled it for some people today.
[00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:16.760]   I got access to it right when the thing went--
[00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:17.760]   Where would it be?
[00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:19.160]   --was that they get a press to?
[00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:21.480]   It would be under your main tab--
[00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:24.240]   it would be in your main tabs on the left-hand side.
[00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:26.040]   Pretty much right under Friends.
[00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:26.960]   OK.
[00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:28.440]   Yeah, so I don't have it yet, I guess.
[00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:30.280]   Oh, I think I can add to you.
[00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:30.840]   Can you add me?
[00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:32.440]   Can you make me a grouper?
[00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:33.400]   I think I can.
[00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:34.960]   I'll try that.
[00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:36.040]   On Facebook, my private--
[00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:37.880]   I don't know if I'm your buddy yet.
[00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:39.360]   How is this different from lists?
[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:40.560]   I mean, they said during the event
[00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:41.800]   that no one wants to make lists.
[00:11:41.800 --> 00:11:42.720]   And I agree.
[00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:44.000]   No one wants to make lists of friends.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:44.960]   This is my softball team.
[00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:46.360]   This is my coworkers.
[00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:47.360]   How was Gris's different?
[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:49.920]   My sense is that--
[00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:52.600]   and Zuckerberg said it to me too-- that no one makes it less.
[00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:55.960]   They like to do it only in the process of doing something else.
[00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:58.360]   So I think in this case, rather than going in
[00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:01.120]   and trying to create a taxonomy of all the friends you already
[00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:02.420]   have, you say, oh, gee, I'd like
[00:12:02.420 --> 00:12:04.880]   to talk to these five people together as a group.
[00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:07.160]   I'll just make him a group.
[00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:07.660]   OK.
[00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:08.560]   So this is a group chat.
[00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:08.560]   I'll go back.
[00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:10.800]   We'll come lists.
[00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:12.360]   Yeah, it's really groups.
[00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:13.320]   You can do all kinds of things.
[00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:14.120]   You can do chat.
[00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:15.480]   And you can chat all at once.
[00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:17.480]   You can just-- you have a wall there
[00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:19.880]   where you can still do all the things you
[00:12:19.880 --> 00:12:21.440]   would on a regular profile wall.
[00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:23.400]   But now it's just inclusive to your group.
[00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:24.400]   It's also interesting that there's
[00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:26.080]   three privacy settings for this.
[00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:29.600]   So there's hidden, which is completely hidden
[00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:30.960]   and completely private.
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:33.900]   There's private, which is invite only.
[00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:36.420]   But people can still search for that group
[00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:37.500]   and see who's in it.
[00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:38.820]   And then there's completely public,
[00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:41.220]   which anyone can join and interact with.
[00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:42.940]   Why name it groups when you already
[00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:45.820]   have something called groups that does something different?
[00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:46.860]   That doesn't make sense to me.
[00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:47.420]   It's really--
[00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:49.220]   Yeah, they talked about that a little bit.
[00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:51.460]   I think Zuckerberg said that they wanted to keep it
[00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:52.380]   as simple as possible.
[00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:53.700]   It is a grouping feature.
[00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:55.140]   So therefore, they called it groups.
[00:12:55.140 --> 00:12:55.460]   OK.
[00:12:55.460 --> 00:12:55.820]   All right.
[00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:57.260]   Few.
[00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:58.260]   There is an explanation.
[00:12:58.260 --> 00:12:58.260]   Yeah.
[00:12:58.260 --> 00:12:59.460]   It's a sucker bug.
[00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:00.260]   So what the movie?
[00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:01.440]   We don't know what it is yet.
[00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:04.040]   It's always changing.
[00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:06.320]   How'd you like the movie, Gina?
[00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:07.500]   I enjoyed the movie.
[00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:10.180]   It infuriated me at times.
[00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:11.540]   But I very much enjoyed it.
[00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:14.140]   I also enjoyed reading reviews, because I
[00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:17.020]   think that people's impression of the movie really reflected
[00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:18.620]   what they--
[00:13:18.620 --> 00:13:19.500]   like their own issues.
[00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:21.740]   Like Nick Denton was quoted as saying
[00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:23.980]   that he felt that the lesson of the movie
[00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:27.140]   was that you have to be a bit of a brute in business, which
[00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:29.940]   I think we should be left.
[00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:31.700]   And I think it could be a good quote for you, Jeff,
[00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:32.940]   and your is--
[00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:36.180]   does business need to be evil panelists out of myself.
[00:13:36.180 --> 00:13:38.220]   But I enjoy the movie very much.
[00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:39.860]   I really related to him.
[00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:43.380]   I love that his obsessiveness with the product
[00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:44.940]   and his ambition and the focus.
[00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:46.820]   I thought something I identified with.
[00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:49.700]   They did make him out to seem like a robot, which he isn't.
[00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:54.180]   Did he seem like an evil person, associate path?
[00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:56.020]   No, he didn't seem like an evil person to me.
[00:13:56.020 --> 00:13:57.180]   The interesting thing in the movie
[00:13:57.180 --> 00:13:58.020]   is that--
[00:13:58.020 --> 00:14:00.460]   and we talked to Dana Bernanke on "Net at Night" last night.
[00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:02.740]   He was the producer for "Tiger of Tour Street."
[00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:04.820]   And he said the Fincher decided this--
[00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:07.060]   and Mesric and Aaron Sorka decided on this almost
[00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:09.940]   "Rash Elman," like you're looking at the same events
[00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:11.140]   from three different perspectives--
[00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:16.260]   Marx, Eduardo's, and the Vinkle Vosses, I guess, I don't know.
[00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:19.780]   And I think that that actually comes out in the way
[00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:20.540]   people see the movie.
[00:14:20.540 --> 00:14:23.220]   Everybody I talk to has kind of a different view of whether
[00:14:23.220 --> 00:14:24.500]   Mark is bad.
[00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:26.060]   Yes.
[00:14:26.060 --> 00:14:27.100]   And it's generational.
[00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:27.860]   It's a cultural form where you sit.
[00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:30.180]   Of course, I was very sensitive to how women were portrayed
[00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:33.660]   and summarily dismissed, basically.
[00:14:33.660 --> 00:14:35.660]   That one scene in the dorm room where it's like,
[00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:38.060]   handing out our responsibilities to the guys.
[00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:39.980]   And they say, who are the girls?
[00:14:39.980 --> 00:14:41.620]   And I was like, no one.
[00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:43.740]   And then one of them says, what can we do?
[00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:45.660]   And he says, nothing.
[00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:47.620]   And I felt like that was kind of indicative of how.
[00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:49.140]   So of course, that was annoying.
[00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:51.780]   But people in my theater chuckled at that line
[00:14:51.780 --> 00:14:53.420]   because it was so ridiculous because they
[00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:56.380]   were building this caricature of this robotic,
[00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:57.580]   nerched guy.
[00:14:57.580 --> 00:15:00.980]   And I mean, so I enjoyed the movie.
[00:15:00.980 --> 00:15:02.860]   I was impressed that the filmmakers made it something
[00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:04.020]   entertaining.
[00:15:04.020 --> 00:15:04.940]   But--
[00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:07.860]   It's very accurate, technically, which I kind of liked.
[00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:09.420]   We talked to Dana about that.
[00:15:09.420 --> 00:15:11.260]   You get WGet Peroll.
[00:15:11.260 --> 00:15:11.780]   Yes.
[00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:12.860]   HTML.
[00:15:12.860 --> 00:15:16.660]   That scene in the computer science classroom
[00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:20.700]   where the professor poses what seems to be an impossible
[00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:22.460]   problem in question.
[00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:24.820]   And then Zuck leaves.
[00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:26.260]   And the professor says, well, I guess
[00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:27.100]   you didn't know the answer.
[00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:27.580]   He says, I know.
[00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:29.420]   And he rattles off the answer.
[00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:31.580]   Dana told us that actually the original answer
[00:15:31.580 --> 00:15:33.780]   that he rattled off in the script was wrong.
[00:15:33.780 --> 00:15:35.140]   They had a consultant on set.
[00:15:35.140 --> 00:15:39.500]   And they actually brought everybody back, relit, and shot it
[00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:40.900]   so that it would be correct.
[00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:41.820]   Wow.
[00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:42.580]   Look at them.
[00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:44.500]   Yeah, the Fincher apparently, that's his thing.
[00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:46.140]   He wants to be actually very correct.
[00:15:46.140 --> 00:15:47.060]   And so it's the most--
[00:15:47.060 --> 00:15:48.460]   About certain things.
[00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:50.180]   Yeah, well, that's the interesting thing.
[00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:51.620]   It's the most technically correct movie
[00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:53.100]   that I've ever seen, but has nothing to do
[00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:54.820]   with the factual reality of Facebook.
[00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:55.820]   But that's OK.
[00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:56.580]   Yeah, right.
[00:15:56.580 --> 00:15:57.860]   I love Les X review.
[00:15:57.860 --> 00:15:58.780]   It lesses to take on it.
[00:15:58.780 --> 00:15:59.260]   I did too.
[00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:01.380]   That was the one I think was most important.
[00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:01.860]   Absolutely.
[00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:02.340]   Me too.
[00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:02.860]   Me too.
[00:16:02.860 --> 00:16:03.860]   And yours, Jeff.
[00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:04.340]   No, no.
[00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:04.980]   But you're very similar.
[00:16:04.980 --> 00:16:05.900]   Well, you say similar things.
[00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:06.740]   We'll hit more of a point.
[00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:10.140]   He used it as an opportunity to give a lecture on net neutrality.
[00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:10.620]   Yeah.
[00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:11.820]   Or a sermon.
[00:16:11.820 --> 00:16:12.900]   Well, that's Larry.
[00:16:12.900 --> 00:16:13.380]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:13.900]   That's good.
[00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:14.860]   That's his thing.
[00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:16.340]   And for those who didn't read it,
[00:16:16.340 --> 00:16:18.140]   it's in the new republictnr.com.
[00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:20.060]   You can read it for free.
[00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:22.100]   And it's really-- he says it's not a movie review.
[00:16:22.100 --> 00:16:23.140]   It's a great movie.
[00:16:23.140 --> 00:16:27.620]   But it misses the most important fact of Facebook, which
[00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:29.740]   is that no one had to ask permission.
[00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:32.620]   That Mark Zuckerberg could create a multi-billion dollar
[00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:35.620]   company with half a billion users in six years.
[00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:38.260]   He didn't ask to ask permission from Harvard,
[00:16:38.260 --> 00:16:40.580]   from the internet, from Telcos.
[00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:43.100]   He only needed $1,000 to start it.
[00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:46.540]   And that's the message of the internet generation
[00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:49.420]   is that you don't have to ask permission anymore.
[00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:50.620]   You can just do it.
[00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:52.500]   And boy, what a great message that is.
[00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:53.100]   Yes.
[00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:54.580]   Yeah.
[00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:56.900]   All right, so that's Facebook.
[00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:59.620]   Not only the actual Facebook, but the picture--
[00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:00.540]   Over the third thing, though.
[00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:01.220]   There was a third thing.
[00:17:01.220 --> 00:17:02.020]   So it was groups?
[00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:02.980]   What was the other thing?
[00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:03.500]   Was it weird?
[00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:05.140]   Did you get the invites to groups?
[00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:08.140]   I just asked you to be my buddy.
[00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:09.020]   Yeah, I accepted.
[00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:11.860]   And I invited you to this one group that everyone created.
[00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:13.060]   All right, so let me see here.
[00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:15.500]   I think, Jeff, the third thing was dashboard.
[00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:17.060]   That's right, new dashboard.
[00:17:17.060 --> 00:17:18.020]   You haven't seen yet.
[00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:19.780]   So just yet more privacy control.
[00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:20.900]   What is the dashboard?
[00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:23.060]   It's a new way of privacy control, Becky.
[00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:24.060]   That's my understanding.
[00:17:24.060 --> 00:17:27.100]   And M.G. has more on this, but that it's more visual and easier
[00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:29.060]   to use privacy setting.
[00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:30.700]   And so the theme of this all today
[00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:32.540]   is control control control.
[00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:34.020]   Yay, Facebook.
[00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:34.520]   Yeah.
[00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:35.940]   But the problem always is when they--
[00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:37.660]   in the past, when they gave more controls,
[00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:38.580]   it was more confusing.
[00:17:38.580 --> 00:17:39.820]   It seemed like less control.
[00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:41.060]   So they've gotten that.
[00:17:41.060 --> 00:17:44.660]   What Facebook giveth Facebook takeeth away?
[00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:45.900]   The Thuckerberg takeeth away.
[00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:46.380]   Oh, good.
[00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:47.540]   So now I can see the group.
[00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:52.460]   So M.G. invited me to a group of tech writers or bloggers.
[00:17:52.460 --> 00:17:54.260]   Tech news bloggers and reporters.
[00:17:54.260 --> 00:17:55.420]   And so it's an open group.
[00:17:55.420 --> 00:17:57.420]   So anybody who has groups can see it.
[00:17:57.420 --> 00:17:58.700]   And there's Dan Patterson.
[00:17:58.700 --> 00:17:59.700]   There's M.G.
[00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:01.740]   There's Dwight Silverman at bot.
[00:18:01.740 --> 00:18:03.740]   Well, this is going to be a fun group to be in, actually.
[00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:04.940]   Hey, hope this is your up, man.
[00:18:04.940 --> 00:18:06.060]   Yeah, I'm just saying.
[00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:06.820]   Invite us.
[00:18:06.820 --> 00:18:07.580]   Yeah, can you invite me?
[00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:09.020]   I like the people in it.
[00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:09.860]   No, sorry.
[00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:10.860]   What?
[00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:12.420]   Yeah, it's very exclusive.
[00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:13.380]   Anybody can join it, right?
[00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:14.900]   M.G. or it's an open group that means--
[00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:16.460]   This one, I think, is a--
[00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:18.900]   this is the middle tier privacy setting.
[00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:20.620]   So I think you have to be invited to join it.
[00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:22.820]   But anyone can see who's in it.
[00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:24.660]   See, I'm glad I got back on Facebook.
[00:18:24.660 --> 00:18:29.620]   Somebody said-- and quite rightly, I understand people
[00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:30.900]   are saying it to me on Twitter.
[00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:31.220]   What?
[00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:32.100]   I've confused Leo.
[00:18:32.100 --> 00:18:32.740]   You hate Facebook.
[00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:33.540]   Now you love Facebook.
[00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:34.660]   You're defending Mark Zuckerberg
[00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:36.980]   against the evils of the social network.
[00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:38.740]   And it's a layered thing.
[00:18:38.740 --> 00:18:41.020]   As geeks, I feel like we can criticize Facebook.
[00:18:41.020 --> 00:18:42.140]   And we could be adamant about it.
[00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:43.580]   And we could say this is a bad thing.
[00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:45.060]   But when it comes to the outside world,
[00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:47.180]   I want to defend my geek, broda.
[00:18:47.180 --> 00:18:48.180]   You know?
[00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:49.140]   It's true.
[00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:49.660]   You know?
[00:18:49.660 --> 00:18:51.740]   I feel like a lot more-- the most positive I've
[00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:53.020]   felt about Facebook in a long time.
[00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:53.500]   Me too.
[00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:54.900]   Because of the movie, and partially because
[00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:55.820]   of these announcements.
[00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:59.380]   So I feel bad for Zach, I think.
[00:18:59.380 --> 00:19:00.460]   I am, me too.
[00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:03.700]   Wow, the new twig, no geek on geek violence.
[00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:04.980]   Yes, that's right.
[00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:05.580]   I like it.
[00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:07.940]   Enough geek on geek violence.
[00:19:07.940 --> 00:19:08.940]   We can't have it.
[00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:09.580]   They listen.
[00:19:09.580 --> 00:19:13.540]   I think the point of this is that Facebook does listen.
[00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:16.020]   In a way, the most important line in the movie, which I'm
[00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:17.860]   sure Zuckerberg does in fact, because we don't know
[00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:18.420]   what it is yet.
[00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:19.860]   It's always changing.
[00:19:19.860 --> 00:19:23.420]   And that goes away from the whole industrial age view
[00:19:23.420 --> 00:19:24.420]   that you have a product.
[00:19:24.420 --> 00:19:25.500]   And you stand by it.
[00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:27.180]   So he's always been.
[00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:32.060]   Whether it was the news feed or the ad program or anything,
[00:19:32.060 --> 00:19:32.900]   he'll throw it out there.
[00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:33.780]   People don't like it.
[00:19:33.780 --> 00:19:35.100]   He says, OK, I was wrong here.
[00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:35.660]   I was right there.
[00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:36.300]   You're wrong there.
[00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:37.700]   And he fixes it and changes it.
[00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:40.020]   And he rolls with those punches.
[00:19:40.020 --> 00:19:42.060]   And that's a whole new way to do this.
[00:19:42.060 --> 00:19:44.700]   And again, Google knew that too with betas.
[00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:48.460]   And forgot that when it came to Buzz.
[00:19:48.460 --> 00:19:51.100]   But that's just the way that Facebook operates.
[00:19:51.100 --> 00:19:53.220]   And I think the movie did a really good job
[00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:56.060]   of showing how he fed off of the response.
[00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:59.580]   Like the more that Facebook grew, the more focused and obsessed
[00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:00.340]   he got about it.
[00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:02.980]   And I love the way he looked at Myspace and said, that's ugly.
[00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:04.700]   And looked at Friendster and said, it's always down.
[00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:06.140]   And said, Facebook's going to be clean.
[00:20:06.140 --> 00:20:07.180]   It's always going to be up.
[00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:10.540]   He controlled his ability to scale by making exclusive to Harvard.
[00:20:10.540 --> 00:20:12.620]   Like, I think he made some really smart decisions.
[00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:14.220]   And the more people-- he was constantly
[00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:16.220]   looking at how many users did he have and iterating
[00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:17.220]   and adding more.
[00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:19.860]   And I think that is the true web experience.
[00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:21.660]   It's that constant feedback and that iterating
[00:20:21.660 --> 00:20:24.540]   and that growing as you go versus creating a finished product
[00:20:24.540 --> 00:20:26.620]   and then issuing it.
[00:20:26.620 --> 00:20:28.060]   So if the movie did anything right,
[00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:31.140]   I certainly think that it did a good job of portraying
[00:20:31.140 --> 00:20:33.140]   a smart programmer who's obsessed and who
[00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:35.900]   was ready to iterate and ready to listen to his users
[00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:38.300]   and go with what they wanted.
[00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:42.340]   And of course, as long as Facebook responds
[00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:44.980]   to their criticisms that we pass along about privacy,
[00:20:44.980 --> 00:20:49.820]   about settings and improves and iterates,
[00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:52.900]   I have no problem with saying, hey, you're doing the right thing.
[00:20:52.900 --> 00:20:54.660]   You're going in the right direction.
[00:20:54.660 --> 00:20:57.980]   I mean, the problem is they had so many privacy setting changes
[00:20:57.980 --> 00:20:59.780]   that confused people over and over again.
[00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:01.260]   After a while, it felt like, are they not
[00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:02.420]   learning from their mistakes?
[00:21:02.420 --> 00:21:03.940]   And today's announcements feel like they're
[00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:04.980]   learning from their mistakes.
[00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:06.620]   And I really sense that they struggle with that.
[00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:07.860]   I mean, I really, really do.
[00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:09.940]   And I don't think it's as simple as just PR,
[00:21:09.940 --> 00:21:12.460]   but a few conversations lately.
[00:21:12.460 --> 00:21:13.860]   They really do try to learn from that.
[00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:16.020]   And part of it is that they are confused
[00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:17.940]   because they have a few of the world that's just not
[00:21:17.940 --> 00:21:19.260]   meshing and how they communicate it.
[00:21:19.260 --> 00:21:21.260]   And that's what Mark said to me when I sat down with them.
[00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:24.420]   I hope you can do a better job of communicating this than we have.
[00:21:24.420 --> 00:21:27.380]   By the way, Jeff Jarvis, you were added to the Facebook group
[00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:30.380]   by Robert Walter Scobull.
[00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:31.340]   Yeah.
[00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:33.140]   Scobull is always ahead of everyone.
[00:21:33.140 --> 00:21:34.740]   He was there first.
[00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:35.260]   Of course he was.
[00:21:35.260 --> 00:21:36.260]   Of course he created the group.
[00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:37.380]   Did he create an option like it?
[00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:37.900]   Who's in this?
[00:21:37.900 --> 00:21:39.420]   Of course he did.
[00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:42.420]   Let's pull up the ladder now, though.
[00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:45.580]   Oh, you get any like that, Stu.
[00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:46.580]   No girls allowed.
[00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:48.340]   Gina, we're going to make our own tree house.
[00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:51.420]   I can't make your make your own group.
[00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:53.260]   OK, I changed my mind.
[00:21:53.260 --> 00:21:54.580]   All girls allowed.
[00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:57.180]   Why have we got groups already?
[00:21:57.180 --> 00:21:58.780]   Really?
[00:21:58.780 --> 00:21:59.260]   Wow.
[00:21:59.260 --> 00:22:00.140]   I just got it.
[00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:02.460]   I'm refreshing my Facebook page like a loser.
[00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:02.980]   Wait a minute.
[00:22:02.980 --> 00:22:03.380]   No, no, no.
[00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:06.900]   How do I add somebody to the page?
[00:22:06.900 --> 00:22:09.460]   First of all, I guess you have to be my friend.
[00:22:09.460 --> 00:22:11.300]   Anyway, we'll take a break and come back.
[00:22:11.300 --> 00:22:15.060]   While I add Gina to the Tech News Bloggers group,
[00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:17.060]   oh, you already are my friend.
[00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:17.820]   We are friends.
[00:22:17.820 --> 00:22:18.980]   We are friends.
[00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:20.660]   So I'm going to add you to my--
[00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:22.420]   somehow I add you to this group.
[00:22:22.420 --> 00:22:23.180]   Can I do that?
[00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:24.780]   Mg, or do you have to be some sort of--
[00:22:24.780 --> 00:22:27.780]   Yeah, go and the right hand column,
[00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:29.580]   click on Add Friends to Group.
[00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:30.860]   It should be right under all the characters.
[00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:30.860]   I see.
[00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:32.180]   Yeah, Add Friends to Group.
[00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:33.900]   It's also a tree that I don't accept or anything.
[00:22:33.900 --> 00:22:34.980]   I'm just there.
[00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:36.620]   Well, that's kind of interesting.
[00:22:36.620 --> 00:22:38.580]   Some people might have-- take issue to that.
[00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:39.940]   Like they do with all Facebook changes.
[00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:44.420]   But it's like you-- it is completely opt out.
[00:22:44.420 --> 00:22:46.340]   Anyone can add you to any group.
[00:22:46.340 --> 00:22:48.380]   And the only other thing is that I do at the group
[00:22:48.380 --> 00:22:49.220]   that are part of the group.
[00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:51.500]   So if I don't ever do anything with it, it doesn't matter.
[00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:52.660]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:22:52.660 --> 00:22:53.660]   Yeah.
[00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:54.540]   I don't see you.
[00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:57.300]   Maybe you aren't my friend, Gina.
[00:22:57.300 --> 00:22:59.060]   I'm going to have to add you as a friend.
[00:22:59.060 --> 00:23:01.300]   Well, I'm a fan.
[00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:04.100]   You see, I'm on your fan page, but I don't know your personal.
[00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:06.660]   So I can't add you, but Becky, I added you.
[00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:07.900]   Oh, thanks, boss.
[00:23:07.900 --> 00:23:09.740]   Because she's my friend.
[00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:10.860]   We're going to take a break.
[00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:13.580]   We have a Cisco announcement and then Google TV.
[00:23:13.580 --> 00:23:15.220]   And lots more to talk about.
[00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:17.860]   Becky Worley had an early morning demonstration
[00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:18.460]   of the Google TV.
[00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:19.660]   We've got some video from there.
[00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:21.260]   And Becky's insights.
[00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:23.100]   MG Seagler is here from TechCrunch.
[00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:25.340]   It's great to have you, MG.
[00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:27.540]   Once again, just love your stuff.
[00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:30.860]   Gina Tripani from SmarterWare.org is also here.
[00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:33.340]   And of course, Jeff Jarvis, Buzzmachine.com.
[00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:35.980]   The author of What Would Google Do If It Were On An Overnight
[00:23:35.980 --> 00:23:37.220]   Flight From Frankfurt.
[00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:42.540]   It wishes.
[00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:45.020]   It's time, though, for me to mention our friends at Citrix,
[00:23:45.020 --> 00:23:48.060]   the makers of the great GoToMeeting.
[00:23:48.060 --> 00:23:50.420]   GoToMeeting is a great solution for anybody
[00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:53.260]   who doesn't want to travel.
[00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:56.340]   Jeff, one of these days, the Germans
[00:23:56.340 --> 00:23:57.500]   will get GoToMeeting.
[00:23:57.500 --> 00:23:58.740]   Sell it to the Germans.
[00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:00.660]   And you're going to not have to go there.
[00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:02.940]   You go there every month, it seems like.
[00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:05.580]   I just passed 100,000 miles.
[00:24:05.580 --> 00:24:06.700]   And let me tell you something.
[00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:07.940]   American Express to this survey--
[00:24:07.940 --> 00:24:09.420]   Just rather be on GoToMeeting.
[00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:10.860]   I can tell you that for sure.
[00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:13.060]   Oh, yeah.
[00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:16.580]   They looked at the costs of business travel.
[00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:19.980]   And it's about $1,000 for each trip.
[00:24:19.980 --> 00:24:22.900]   That includes the airfare, hotel, taxis, and all that.
[00:24:22.900 --> 00:24:24.660]   Really, this is a great way to cut costs,
[00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:26.380]   be more efficient, work more efficiently,
[00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:30.460]   be improved processes, save money by reducing travel,
[00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:32.460]   improve communications with the people you work with,
[00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:34.820]   help you work smarter and be more efficient.
[00:24:34.820 --> 00:24:35.380]   GoToMeeting.
[00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:37.100]   There are other online meeting solutions.
[00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:40.820]   I know you can try them all, please do.
[00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:43.460]   And here's a 30-day code to try GoToMeeting.
[00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:45.540]   And I guarantee you, you will come back to GoToMeeting.
[00:24:45.540 --> 00:24:46.100]   It's the best.
[00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:48.780]   For product reviews, sales presentations, training
[00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:51.140]   sessions, collaboration sessions,
[00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:52.980]   turning conference calls into boring--
[00:24:52.980 --> 00:24:57.580]   from boring audio presentations to something
[00:24:57.580 --> 00:24:59.900]   exciting, engaging, and functional.
[00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:03.540]   30 days free, go to meeting.com/twig.
[00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:07.020]   GoToMeeting.com.
[00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:10.020]   Now, now they're saying offer code twig.
[00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:11.220]   So if they ask you for an offer code,
[00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:13.420]   just use two TWIG and there.
[00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:14.460]   I'm confused.
[00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:16.700]   Go to meeting.com/twig or offer code twig.
[00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:19.980]   Either way, 30 days free of the, simply the best, most
[00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:22.500]   secure, fastest online meeting solution.
[00:25:22.500 --> 00:25:25.060]   We thank Citrix for their support of this.
[00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:28.180]   We can Google and invite you to try, please.
[00:25:28.180 --> 00:25:29.740]   Go to meeting.
[00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:33.380]   Very briefly, Citrix announced the new UMA
[00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:34.260]   Thurman phone.
[00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:35.020]   What is it?
[00:25:35.020 --> 00:25:36.620]   Umi?
[00:25:36.620 --> 00:25:37.980]   Maybe Cisco.
[00:25:37.980 --> 00:25:38.820]   The Cisco.
[00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:40.060]   Cisco, Umo.
[00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:41.420]   Cisco.
[00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:42.700]   Cisco, Umo.
[00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:43.980]   Cisco for man.
[00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:45.100]   They said it sounds like UMA--
[00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:48.060]   Oprah, Oprah, Oprah, Oprah, Uma.
[00:25:48.060 --> 00:25:49.580]   You, me.
[00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:50.660]   Oh, I get it.
[00:25:50.660 --> 00:25:53.580]   You, you, and me.
[00:25:53.580 --> 00:25:55.500]   Is there an Uma out involved at all?
[00:25:55.500 --> 00:25:58.940]   No double dots.
[00:25:58.940 --> 00:25:59.940]   How's it spelled, Umi?
[00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:00.780]   Umi.
[00:26:00.780 --> 00:26:03.740]   Cara Swisher said it sounded like bad sushi she wouldn't eat.
[00:26:03.740 --> 00:26:06.220]   Umi.
[00:26:06.220 --> 00:26:07.580]   Umi.
[00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:09.420]   But the other thing that's weird about it-- and this was Jim
[00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:12.020]   Lauterback pointing this out in a tweet saying, they're
[00:26:12.020 --> 00:26:15.060]   calling it actually the Umi telepresence.
[00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:19.740]   So really geeky name for a super-consumer product.
[00:26:19.740 --> 00:26:21.660]   Yeah, not at a consumer price.
[00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:22.300]   Right.
[00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:22.820]   Right.
[00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:23.420]   $600.
[00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:24.900]   $600.
[00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:28.140]   And this is video content for your HDTV.
[00:26:28.140 --> 00:26:32.020]   So it's-- OK, so now we saw Skype offer this at CES.
[00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:34.540]   You know, Skype camera, Skype TV.
[00:26:34.540 --> 00:26:35.860]   Much less expensive.
[00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:36.900]   Cisco's--
[00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:38.500]   Umi.
[00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:39.500]   Umi.
[00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:40.500]   Umi.
[00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:42.060]   Umi.
[00:26:42.060 --> 00:26:43.660]   OK.
[00:26:43.660 --> 00:26:45.020]   Is it camera?
[00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:47.940]   It looks like-- well, I see it's got a bar over the U,
[00:26:47.940 --> 00:26:49.020]   so it's a long--
[00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:50.020]   Umi.
[00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:51.900]   They told me it was--
[00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:52.380]   You mind.
[00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:54.620]   No, it is Umi because it's a long, long U.
[00:26:54.620 --> 00:26:55.460]   I understand.
[00:26:55.460 --> 00:26:57.740]   It's a camera and a console.
[00:26:57.740 --> 00:26:58.500]   OK.
[00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:01.540]   And they say it dynamically adjusts to lighting conditions
[00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:02.540]   in your room.
[00:27:02.540 --> 00:27:03.900]   It's full HD.
[00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:07.980]   It adjusts to the size of the room for sound purposes.
[00:27:07.980 --> 00:27:11.540]   It prioritizes the video conferencing.
[00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:13.300]   And this is the part that's unbelievable.
[00:27:13.300 --> 00:27:16.580]   $600 plus $24 a month.
[00:27:16.580 --> 00:27:19.060]   What?
[00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:20.380]   A monthly fee?
[00:27:20.380 --> 00:27:21.340]   $25.
[00:27:21.340 --> 00:27:23.980]   Now, that could be subsidized if you perhaps ran it
[00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:26.620]   through Verizon Fios or through Comcast.
[00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:28.780]   And then they're going to, as I said, prioritize some channels.
[00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:29.780]   But it just--
[00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:31.220]   That sounds like they think this is going
[00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:32.340]   to replace your phone service.
[00:27:32.340 --> 00:27:33.900]   Like, you won't pay for your telco.
[00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:35.180]   You'll just use Umi.
[00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:35.860]   Umi.
[00:27:35.860 --> 00:27:37.180]   Nuts.
[00:27:37.180 --> 00:27:38.020]   Nuts.
[00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:40.060]   It does have a video voicemail.
[00:27:40.060 --> 00:27:41.100]   That's kind of cool.
[00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:42.940]   It also has interoperability because you
[00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:46.860]   can use it with somebody else who has Google Chat.
[00:27:46.860 --> 00:27:48.340]   Ah.
[00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:49.220]   So I can use--
[00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:50.900]   because I think most of the people
[00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:53.260]   everybody listening to this show either use Skype or And/or
[00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:56.220]   Google Voice and Google Chat, which
[00:27:56.220 --> 00:27:58.340]   allows you to have--
[00:27:58.340 --> 00:28:00.140]   The big question for this show is whether or not
[00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:02.620]   it could improve the quality of this horrible grainy,
[00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:04.180]   pinkish version of BUC.
[00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:08.220]   Well, you know what we are going to buy a unit and just see.
[00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:10.580]   My theory on that, Jeff, is that it fundamentally
[00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:12.140]   comes down to the glass and the cameras.
[00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:14.220]   They've put out all these HD cameras that
[00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:15.180]   change the connections.
[00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:18.260]   But if they're these tiny little eyeballs that have crappy glass,
[00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:19.940]   you're going to have a crappy signal.
[00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:22.700]   It does tie into the Logitech announcement
[00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:25.700]   because they also announced a camera using Carl Zeiss lenses.
[00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:29.820]   The Logitech actually does excellent cameras for Skype.
[00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:31.700]   There's C150, which is $60.
[00:28:31.700 --> 00:28:33.260]   It's a very nice camera.
[00:28:33.260 --> 00:28:35.020]   So somebody has decided--
[00:28:35.020 --> 00:28:38.380]   it's funny how the industry all moves like a school of fish.
[00:28:38.380 --> 00:28:44.100]   Somebody has decided, short of absent any evidence in favor,
[00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:46.260]   that everybody now wants to sit in front of their TV
[00:28:46.260 --> 00:28:47.420]   and talk to mom and dad.
[00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:49.660]   This is what everybody wants to do.
[00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:51.380]   And not only the Cisco announcement,
[00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:53.620]   but I don't know if this one is kind of sneaked by the other day.
[00:28:53.620 --> 00:28:56.980]   But the T-Mobile My Touch that they announced
[00:28:56.980 --> 00:28:59.100]   has a front-facing camera, and it has
[00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:02.700]   phone-to-laptop video conferencing.
[00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:05.060]   And that's one of the first ones that's doing that--
[00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:07.060]   So it's like FaceTime.
[00:29:07.060 --> 00:29:08.500]   But with standards.
[00:29:08.500 --> 00:29:09.260]   Yeah.
[00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:10.660]   And it's, again, interoperable.
[00:29:10.660 --> 00:29:12.740]   And I think that's been the barrier up until now,
[00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:15.860]   is that FaceTime, where are these APIs, Steve Jobs promise,
[00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:17.660]   that are going to supposedly open this up?
[00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:20.060]   So now, if video conferencing is, as you said,
[00:29:20.060 --> 00:29:23.180]   really moving forward for the whole industry,
[00:29:23.180 --> 00:29:26.660]   then that's, in my opinion, the thing that's going to open it up.
[00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:29.500]   So the fact that it works with Google Voice and Google Chat
[00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:31.340]   is actually a good thing for the Cisco Yumi.
[00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:32.660]   Is the price a non-starter?
[00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:33.220]   I think it is.
[00:29:33.220 --> 00:29:33.860]   Complete.
[00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:34.860]   Yeah, totally.
[00:29:34.860 --> 00:29:36.420]   No, nobody's going to do this.
[00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:38.540]   What's expensive in that box?
[00:29:38.540 --> 00:29:40.220]   I mean, the lens, yeah, the glass,
[00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:42.180]   but how expensive can it be?
[00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:43.820]   Unless there's some super-secret sauce,
[00:29:43.820 --> 00:29:46.820]   but see, even consumers don't say, oh, this
[00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:49.420]   looks so much better than the $25 solution that's--
[00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:51.460]   Oh, grandma, I can see all of your wrinkles.
[00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:52.220]   Yeah.
[00:29:52.220 --> 00:29:56.380]   So now, one thing that didn't sound so hot in the demo
[00:29:56.380 --> 00:29:58.340]   of the Google TV was the audio.
[00:29:58.340 --> 00:30:00.580]   And maybe they're using expensive array mics
[00:30:00.580 --> 00:30:01.620]   to get a better audio.
[00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:02.780]   Because I'll tell you what, if you're
[00:30:02.780 --> 00:30:05.580]   sitting 10 feet away from the microphone in a big room,
[00:30:05.580 --> 00:30:07.060]   you're just going to sound awful.
[00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:08.380]   Which demo is this the--
[00:30:08.380 --> 00:30:12.060]   The Logitech Google TV demo, they did demo it.
[00:30:12.060 --> 00:30:15.460]   And at least, they're in gadgets that, oh, it sounds terrible.
[00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:17.820]   I think that's ultimately going to be the impediment
[00:30:17.820 --> 00:30:20.180]   for this living room, lean back, skipes.
[00:30:20.180 --> 00:30:21.940]   Everyone's going to have lip-bell mics.
[00:30:21.940 --> 00:30:23.700]   I mean, what are you going to have a shot under mic?
[00:30:23.700 --> 00:30:24.140]   I like it.
[00:30:24.140 --> 00:30:25.380]   A directional.
[00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:29.580]   Well, you could get-- there are mics that--
[00:30:29.580 --> 00:30:32.740]   In theory, could give you good results from 10 feet away.
[00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:33.420]   I don't know what.
[00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:35.420]   Again, it's going to have to be directional, right?
[00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:36.820]   Maybe that's what's so expensive.
[00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:37.780]   I would say.
[00:30:37.780 --> 00:30:39.300]   Grandma, move a little to the left.
[00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:40.820]   I can hardly hear you.
[00:30:40.820 --> 00:30:41.820]   What is it?
[00:30:41.820 --> 00:30:43.820]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:45.260]   Oh, shunning.
[00:30:45.260 --> 00:30:46.260]   Yeah.
[00:30:46.260 --> 00:30:47.260]   Oh, shunning.
[00:30:47.260 --> 00:30:48.260]   Here's something else.
[00:30:48.260 --> 00:30:49.460]   As a TV producer, I can tell you that people will always
[00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:50.580]   forgive you bad video.
[00:30:50.580 --> 00:30:52.700]   They will never forgive you bad audio.
[00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:53.380]   Isn't that funny?
[00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:53.740]   Yeah.
[00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:55.300]   And certainly, we spend a lot of money.
[00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:58.100]   And one of the reasons our attractive video has
[00:30:58.100 --> 00:31:00.620]   these ginormous microphones in here
[00:31:00.620 --> 00:31:02.180]   is because we want good sound.
[00:31:02.180 --> 00:31:06.700]   And we sent Gina and Jeff $600 microphones
[00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:09.300]   so that they look and sound good.
[00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:12.100]   Those are very expensive countrymen microphones.
[00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:12.620]   Yes.
[00:31:12.620 --> 00:31:13.460]   And they do sound good.
[00:31:13.460 --> 00:31:16.460]   But I don't know.
[00:31:16.460 --> 00:31:18.300]   I would-- well, look, we're going
[00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:19.820]   to have to buy one just because if it's better,
[00:31:19.820 --> 00:31:21.180]   we'll use it.
[00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:23.100]   But we'll let you know.
[00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:23.820]   We'll do a demo of that.
[00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:28.260]   Now, let's talk about the meat of the matter, which is--
[00:31:28.260 --> 00:31:31.180]   Logitech also had an event in San Francisco today
[00:31:31.180 --> 00:31:34.300]   to show their new Logitech review, which
[00:31:34.300 --> 00:31:36.420]   is their Google TV device.
[00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:38.100]   Becky Worley couldn't be there for the event,
[00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:41.740]   so she snuck in early and got a little demo from--
[00:31:41.740 --> 00:31:43.140]   was it from Google or from Logitech?
[00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:45.260]   It was from Logitech.
[00:31:45.260 --> 00:31:48.700]   And it was great to see it in action.
[00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:51.980]   And the idea here is this is the set top box, or the box,
[00:31:51.980 --> 00:31:57.300]   that's going to sit between your devices and your TV,
[00:31:57.300 --> 00:32:01.140]   and put the Google UI on your TV.
[00:32:01.140 --> 00:32:03.380]   So they have a big keyboard, which
[00:32:03.380 --> 00:32:04.940]   looks like a standard size keyboard.
[00:32:04.940 --> 00:32:08.740]   Wireless via RF, so it's not line of sight.
[00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:14.260]   And that connects up via HDMI to your TV and the cable box,
[00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:15.620]   or whatever your main video--
[00:32:15.620 --> 00:32:18.100]   The keyboard is RF, but there is
[00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:20.780]   a set top box that has in and out HDMI.
[00:32:20.780 --> 00:32:23.060]   The in comes from your cable box,
[00:32:23.060 --> 00:32:24.580]   and the out goes to your TV.
[00:32:24.580 --> 00:32:27.380]   So it's interposing itself between your TV and your source.
[00:32:27.380 --> 00:32:27.740]   Right.
[00:32:27.740 --> 00:32:30.340]   And obviously, what it does is it
[00:32:30.340 --> 00:32:32.060]   consolidates all of your content, as we've
[00:32:32.060 --> 00:32:33.740]   seen with the Google TV UI.
[00:32:33.740 --> 00:32:36.140]   And it brings information from the web.
[00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:37.900]   You can see you can search for something,
[00:32:37.900 --> 00:32:39.620]   and it'll give you results from the web.
[00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:41.180]   So here, he searched for Top Gear.
[00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:41.980]   He's got YouTube.
[00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:44.700]   He's got stored stuff on the DVR.
[00:32:44.700 --> 00:32:46.420]   That requires a dish DVR.
[00:32:46.420 --> 00:32:46.700]   Right.
[00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:50.020]   It doesn't search your DVR if you don't have a dish.
[00:32:50.020 --> 00:32:51.620]   It also searches programming listings,
[00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:53.940]   so you can see BBC America will have it today at 3.
[00:32:53.940 --> 00:32:55.380]   So all of those showed up.
[00:32:55.380 --> 00:32:57.980]   And I presume you could set a DVR-- if you had the dish DVR,
[00:32:57.980 --> 00:33:00.500]   set a DVR recording, playback DVR recording.
[00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:01.940]   Now, can you watch YouTube on this?
[00:33:01.940 --> 00:33:02.620]   Yes, you can.
[00:33:02.620 --> 00:33:03.300]   Oh, what a surprise.
[00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:04.260]   Is that a Google product?
[00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:05.860]   I think it is.
[00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:08.140]   It also has picture in picture.
[00:33:08.140 --> 00:33:11.220]   And so you can watch in the small window
[00:33:11.220 --> 00:33:13.820]   while you watch YouTube videos, or--
[00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:14.500]   You can tweet.
[00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:18.100]   Apps, like Twitter, or any of the built-in apps.
[00:33:18.100 --> 00:33:19.300]   I'm scanning through this here.
[00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:20.860]   So it's got Pandora.
[00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:21.900]   It's got Netflix.
[00:33:21.900 --> 00:33:23.700]   Although the Netflix interface is not
[00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:25.940]   the most recent Netflix interface,
[00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:29.180]   it's the old Roku version 1 interface.
[00:33:29.180 --> 00:33:30.980]   It's got the Amazon video on demand.
[00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:31.980]   I like that.
[00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:33.020]   Gotta have that.
[00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:37.020]   And my postulation after seeing this is the problem--
[00:33:37.020 --> 00:33:40.180]   and I go back to what Steve Jobs said when he was asked at DA
[00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:41.380]   about Apple TV.
[00:33:41.380 --> 00:33:44.060]   He said, the problem with set-top boxes
[00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:47.100]   and getting involved in TV is a go-to-market problem.
[00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:51.140]   People are not conditioned to buy set-top boxes.
[00:33:51.140 --> 00:33:53.820]   They presume that they'll be subsidized by the cable company
[00:33:53.820 --> 00:33:55.460]   or by your provider.
[00:33:55.460 --> 00:33:57.820]   And so people won't shell out money for that.
[00:33:57.820 --> 00:33:59.820]   But when I asked--
[00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:01.580]   Logitech about that, they said, you know what?
[00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:04.540]   Our most popular universal remote, the Harmony 1,
[00:34:04.540 --> 00:34:06.780]   costs $150.
[00:34:06.780 --> 00:34:09.340]   That's really the starting point for them.
[00:34:09.340 --> 00:34:11.100]   They go up to $500.
[00:34:11.100 --> 00:34:14.340]   And they think that the sweet spot is about $250.
[00:34:14.340 --> 00:34:14.940]   And guess what?
[00:34:14.940 --> 00:34:18.940]   That's what this box and this keyboard cost $299.
[00:34:18.940 --> 00:34:21.420]   And then you can get it subsidized if you get it with dish.
[00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:24.620]   But the point is they're selling this as a remote
[00:34:24.620 --> 00:34:26.660]   with some Google stuff on it.
[00:34:26.660 --> 00:34:29.940]   Although there's a free iPhone and Android app
[00:34:29.940 --> 00:34:31.180]   that is pretty sophisticated.
[00:34:31.180 --> 00:34:33.420]   In fact, if I skip ahead a little bit in your video--
[00:34:33.420 --> 00:34:35.100]   Do I get to get past all this keyboard stuff
[00:34:35.100 --> 00:34:36.700]   and just use my phone?
[00:34:36.700 --> 00:34:38.460]   Yes, but they just still need to buy the--
[00:34:38.460 --> 00:34:39.980]   It's like a nightmare.
[00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:41.620]   Yeah, I mean, if you're not into the keyboard,
[00:34:41.620 --> 00:34:43.020]   and I mean, did we not see this?
[00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:44.420]   Or it might be Web TV.
[00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:45.260]   Web TV.
[00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:46.420]   It looks a lot like Web TV.
[00:34:46.420 --> 00:34:47.540]   But wait a minute.
[00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:48.540]   Here, Jeff, watch this.
[00:34:48.540 --> 00:34:51.780]   This is the Android interface, which is--
[00:34:51.780 --> 00:34:52.580]   We asked you--
[00:34:52.580 --> 00:34:56.700]   let me actually, before I talk about the application on this,
[00:34:56.700 --> 00:34:58.780]   there may be a lot of different evil things.
[00:34:58.780 --> 00:35:01.900]   So let's say, somebody else is watching TV.
[00:35:01.900 --> 00:35:04.380]   And I am browsing YouTube.
[00:35:04.380 --> 00:35:06.220]   And I find a video that I want to share.
[00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:07.340]   On your phone.
[00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:11.140]   So what I'm going to do is press this video.
[00:35:11.140 --> 00:35:12.380]   And I want to share it.
[00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:14.380]   So this is the standard Android interface.
[00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:15.020]   And I'm giving the app--
[00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:16.940]   Oh, I want to share it with my harmony.
[00:35:16.940 --> 00:35:19.660]   There's harmony as one of the sharing items.
[00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:20.820]   This is cool.
[00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:24.020]   It's now going to the TV--
[00:35:24.020 --> 00:35:25.180]   Is this a full browser?
[00:35:25.180 --> 00:35:26.100]   Basically, that's the idea.
[00:35:26.100 --> 00:35:27.420]   Looks like a full browser.
[00:35:27.420 --> 00:35:28.020]   Yeah.
[00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:29.420]   I'm showing up on my TV screen.
[00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:31.100]   It looks like this regular YouTube.
[00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:32.500]   That's awesome.
[00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:32.940]   Oh, yeah.
[00:35:32.940 --> 00:35:35.340]   So he sent basically a YouTube page to his TV,
[00:35:35.340 --> 00:35:38.900]   kind of like Chrome to a phone.
[00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:40.980]   It's basically like flicking it to your TV.
[00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:43.420]   And if your TV is off and your components,
[00:35:43.420 --> 00:35:45.500]   like your receiver are off, if you do that,
[00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:49.380]   it'll turn all of your devices on.
[00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:50.580]   So I thought that was kind of--
[00:35:50.580 --> 00:35:51.300]   That's interesting.
[00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:53.540]   So it knows about your devices because it's a harmony remote,
[00:35:53.540 --> 00:35:54.900]   basically.
[00:35:54.900 --> 00:35:56.340]   Now that's a free app.
[00:35:56.340 --> 00:36:00.180]   The app has to be in conjunction with the Logitech review box.
[00:36:00.180 --> 00:36:02.260]   So you spend the $2.99 on the box.
[00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:03.700]   Now you can control it.
[00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:04.700]   Now this is Android.
[00:36:04.700 --> 00:36:06.340]   They send iPhone too, right?
[00:36:06.340 --> 00:36:07.220]   You saw that on the web.
[00:36:07.220 --> 00:36:08.260]   I didn't ask him about that.
[00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:08.860]   Yeah, he did.
[00:36:08.860 --> 00:36:09.540]   Well, they may not--
[00:36:09.540 --> 00:36:11.300]   And they have to get through Apple's approval process.
[00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:12.820]   Let me ask two questions.
[00:36:12.820 --> 00:36:15.740]   First, is there one winner for me?
[00:36:15.740 --> 00:36:16.820]   So on the end of the day--
[00:36:16.820 --> 00:36:17.180]   No.
[00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:18.740]   I have the Roku box now.
[00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:19.260]   No.
[00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:21.500]   I have not yet opened up my Apple TV box.
[00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:22.860]   And now there's this.
[00:36:22.860 --> 00:36:25.020]   Is there any reason to use more than one?
[00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:27.060]   Because of the deals they've done with programmers?
[00:36:27.060 --> 00:36:28.900]   Because of what?
[00:36:28.900 --> 00:36:32.100]   Why wouldn't I use this if it has Netflix and Amazon?
[00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:33.100]   Amazon.
[00:36:33.100 --> 00:36:35.340]   Well, it doesn't have ABC, NBC, CBS.
[00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:36.940]   No, no, but I keep my--
[00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:38.300]   but the way it is right now--
[00:36:38.300 --> 00:36:39.300]   oh, I see what you're saying.
[00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:40.580]   So one content provider.
[00:36:40.580 --> 00:36:41.580]   So they've just got--
[00:36:41.580 --> 00:36:42.260]   What does one person say?
[00:36:42.260 --> 00:36:43.260]   Is there any reason to--
[00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:44.260]   It's not a lot of cars yet.
[00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:45.220]   You can't do a lot of cars yet.
[00:36:45.220 --> 00:36:45.820]   I don't think so.
[00:36:45.820 --> 00:36:46.820]   Yeah, Google--
[00:36:46.820 --> 00:36:49.580]   Google positioning this is pretty smart
[00:36:49.580 --> 00:36:53.260]   because they're unlike Apple TV and unlike the Roku box
[00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:55.180]   and unlike the upcoming boxy box.
[00:36:55.180 --> 00:36:57.460]   They're making it as an add-on to what you already have.
[00:36:57.460 --> 00:36:59.580]   So if you have-- especially with Dish Network,
[00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:00.620]   which they have a nice deal with.
[00:37:00.620 --> 00:37:02.780]   But even if you just have a regular cable provider
[00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:05.260]   because of the HD in and out, you basically
[00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:08.860]   make this as an intermediary device,
[00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:11.540]   kind of like you used to do a TiVo back in the day or whatnot.
[00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:13.940]   And so this is their kind of stepping stone.
[00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:16.900]   Because I think they realize that people aren't quite ready yet
[00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:18.460]   to move to just having--
[00:37:18.460 --> 00:37:20.540]   killing cable and just having whatever content
[00:37:20.540 --> 00:37:23.340]   is from the internet on YouTube and Netflix and whatnot.
[00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:26.260]   So this is kind of a smart position for them, I think.
[00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:27.700]   OK, so here's my next question.
[00:37:27.700 --> 00:37:28.940]   So I have--
[00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:29.700]   I'm wacky.
[00:37:29.700 --> 00:37:31.980]   I may have all three of those boxes or four of those boxes
[00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:33.460]   because I'm doing this.
[00:37:33.460 --> 00:37:39.340]   But I may have more than one plus a cable box plus a DVR
[00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:40.740]   plus something else.
[00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:42.900]   And this thing has one HDMI.
[00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:44.820]   Now we need to get an HDMI switcher.
[00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:46.860]   Yeah, if you're going to have all those anywhere,
[00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:48.820]   you want an AV receiver.
[00:37:48.820 --> 00:37:50.380]   Oh, yeah.
[00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:52.340]   They actually showed you an AV receiver, Becky.
[00:37:52.340 --> 00:37:53.460]   I saw that in the bottom there.
[00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:54.460]   Absolutely, yeah.
[00:37:54.460 --> 00:37:58.980]   And I think the all to the ideal way that this would work
[00:37:58.980 --> 00:38:02.540]   is with this dish network built into it
[00:38:02.540 --> 00:38:04.420]   because that's the way it's currently set up.
[00:38:04.420 --> 00:38:04.940]   It's great for dish.
[00:38:04.940 --> 00:38:06.140]   Let me show you one other thing.
[00:38:06.140 --> 00:38:07.820]   Now you have to tell me if this is what I think--
[00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:10.380]   if I'm looking at what I think I'm looking at.
[00:38:10.380 --> 00:38:12.900]   So this is the Android application.
[00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:14.340]   He's pointing it at the TV.
[00:38:14.340 --> 00:38:16.820]   It says watch Google TV.
[00:38:16.820 --> 00:38:20.580]   And right up here on the TV set, which is turning on now
[00:38:20.580 --> 00:38:23.700]   because it's going to come on.
[00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:25.500]   Yeah, it's going to be the right end.
[00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:26.780]   It's 1080p.
[00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:28.740]   Yeah, I asked him about that specifically.
[00:38:28.740 --> 00:38:29.580]   It's 1080p.
[00:38:29.580 --> 00:38:31.020]   It's 1080p.
[00:38:31.020 --> 00:38:31.780]   That's big.
[00:38:31.780 --> 00:38:35.220]   Apple 720p, the Roku box promises 1080p
[00:38:35.220 --> 00:38:38.140]   but is not yet 1080p.
[00:38:38.140 --> 00:38:38.740]   That's big.
[00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:40.780]   I think that's more important than maybe people
[00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:42.180]   would recognize.
[00:38:42.180 --> 00:38:45.340]   You're now going to have high-def quality video on here.
[00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:46.100]   Yeah.
[00:38:46.100 --> 00:38:47.340]   No, I specifically asked him.
[00:38:47.340 --> 00:38:49.700]   He said absolutely 1080p.
[00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:51.620]   That's something Apple can't do right now.
[00:38:51.620 --> 00:38:53.740]   Roku can't do right now.
[00:38:53.740 --> 00:38:55.900]   So do I return my Apple TV before I open it?
[00:38:55.900 --> 00:38:56.980]   No, no, no.
[00:38:56.980 --> 00:38:58.340]   Now, let's talk about what it can do.
[00:38:58.340 --> 00:39:01.020]   So the Apple TV, this is what you're going to--
[00:39:01.020 --> 00:39:04.620]   I think we are still in this crazy tower of Apple world.
[00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:05.100]   Yeah.
[00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:09.420]   Because you're going to need a big form with checkboxes in it.
[00:39:09.420 --> 00:39:13.340]   Apple TV does two things, iTunes and Netflix.
[00:39:13.340 --> 00:39:14.260]   That's it.
[00:39:14.260 --> 00:39:23.020]   Roku box doesn't do iTunes but does do Netflix and Amazon.
[00:39:23.020 --> 00:39:25.740]   Bunch of channels, including Twit.
[00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:27.340]   You can watch news shows on it.
[00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:29.300]   In fact, anything that's a podcast you can watch on it.
[00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:31.380]   Oh, actually, though, with the Apple, with the iTunes,
[00:39:31.380 --> 00:39:33.820]   I guess if it's a podcast, you could go through the podcast
[00:39:33.820 --> 00:39:34.620]   interface.
[00:39:34.620 --> 00:39:37.860]   Then Google TV, which has pretty much the same partners
[00:39:37.860 --> 00:39:40.900]   as the Roku, they said Hulu is being blocked,
[00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:43.540]   but they're negotiating with Hulu.
[00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:45.420]   It sounds like Google TV is likely
[00:39:45.420 --> 00:39:47.860]   to have the largest set of additional partners,
[00:39:47.860 --> 00:39:49.700]   including HBO as a partner on there.
[00:39:49.700 --> 00:39:52.580]   Yeah, this is an issue of really making deals
[00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:55.780]   and who has the power of collusion is maybe a strong word,
[00:39:55.780 --> 00:39:59.060]   but the power to get everybody together on this.
[00:39:59.060 --> 00:40:00.980]   And it may take a Google to do it.
[00:40:00.980 --> 00:40:03.980]   It certainly doesn't seem like Roku or one of the other hardware
[00:40:03.980 --> 00:40:06.580]   makers has been able to push the tides in order to--
[00:40:06.580 --> 00:40:08.620]   I would have said until they were up.
[00:40:08.620 --> 00:40:09.940]   Roku was the leader on this, but I'm
[00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:11.820]   starting to think now that this Google is kind of going
[00:40:11.820 --> 00:40:12.700]   to move ahead.
[00:40:12.700 --> 00:40:15.980]   Well, they also have an app, a deal with CBS.
[00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:18.940]   An app is what Molly said.
[00:40:18.940 --> 00:40:19.620]   Molly Wood said.
[00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:19.980]   Interesting.
[00:40:19.980 --> 00:40:21.780]   The marketplace is not yet on.
[00:40:21.780 --> 00:40:24.340]   They say soon in 2011 to the Google marketplace,
[00:40:24.340 --> 00:40:26.740]   which means you can add apps.
[00:40:26.740 --> 00:40:29.580]   OK, but two negatives, two big glaring negatives.
[00:40:29.580 --> 00:40:34.420]   One, two 99, Apple TV's 99 bucks, Roku's 99 bucks or less.
[00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:35.340]   Expect a subsidy.
[00:40:35.340 --> 00:40:36.940]   I bet it'll come down to 149.
[00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:38.660]   I think the price point has to be under--
[00:40:38.660 --> 00:40:39.180]   I agree.
[00:40:39.180 --> 00:40:40.420]   150 is a sweet spot.
[00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:43.100]   Two, it's complex as hell.
[00:40:43.100 --> 00:40:44.900]   An app, this is what Apple's selling is new.
[00:40:44.900 --> 00:40:47.220]   Well, Steve says, you don't want a computer.
[00:40:47.220 --> 00:40:48.940]   You want those TV.
[00:40:48.940 --> 00:40:50.940]   And if I could go back to that remote issue,
[00:40:50.940 --> 00:40:52.740]   that's the only way that they can get you to the program.
[00:40:52.740 --> 00:40:53.940]   Yeah, look at that remote.
[00:40:53.940 --> 00:40:56.020]   But see, people already have to do that.
[00:40:56.020 --> 00:40:58.300]   That's the problem facing the living room
[00:40:58.300 --> 00:41:00.060]   in the living room right now for the consumer.
[00:41:00.060 --> 00:41:01.700]   Oh, yeah, my wife hates me because she says,
[00:41:01.700 --> 00:41:03.940]   I can't watch TV.
[00:41:03.940 --> 00:41:07.580]   Yeah, I just want to watch TV.
[00:41:07.580 --> 00:41:10.420]   That's where I think it's not one UI to rule them all.
[00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:12.540]   It's just give me one freaking remote to rule them.
[00:41:12.540 --> 00:41:14.620]   Yeah, I don't want there remote to be six feet wide.
[00:41:14.620 --> 00:41:15.460]   Well, that's true.
[00:41:15.460 --> 00:41:16.460]   Well, you can use your phone.
[00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:17.620]   It's a damn surfboard.
[00:41:17.620 --> 00:41:18.660]   You can use your phone.
[00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:19.700]   It has to be the phone.
[00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:21.860]   I mean, the Apple TV also interacts with the phone.
[00:41:21.860 --> 00:41:24.460]   It's so much better than the Apple TV remote is,
[00:41:24.460 --> 00:41:26.460]   which is that little undersized thing, which looks great.
[00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:29.580]   But it's like, it's really hard to type anything on,
[00:41:29.580 --> 00:41:30.260]   obviously.
[00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:31.820]   So this thing would be great for typing on.
[00:41:31.820 --> 00:41:33.420]   But who wants to have a keyboard sitting on there,
[00:41:33.420 --> 00:41:34.420]   you know, coffee table?
[00:41:34.420 --> 00:41:37.020]   Can you assume that everybody will have a smartphone,
[00:41:37.020 --> 00:41:39.420]   Android or Apple phone that will work with these things?
[00:41:39.420 --> 00:41:42.580]   I mean, can they just say, well, look, that's the universe.
[00:41:42.580 --> 00:41:43.580]   Yeah, except the soul.
[00:41:43.580 --> 00:41:45.820]   I'm the dad and I have the phone and I'm out of the room.
[00:41:45.820 --> 00:41:46.340]   Right.
[00:41:46.340 --> 00:41:48.940]   And somebody else will leave your phone on the coffee table.
[00:41:48.940 --> 00:41:49.620]   That's ridiculous.
[00:41:49.620 --> 00:41:52.020]   I'm guessing, and I don't have confirmation on this,
[00:41:52.020 --> 00:41:54.340]   but based on the way that Logitech's projects work,
[00:41:54.340 --> 00:41:57.060]   I'm guessing that all of their Harmony remotes
[00:41:57.060 --> 00:41:58.820]   will control the review box.
[00:41:58.820 --> 00:42:00.980]   At least you may not have query input,
[00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:04.140]   but it'll at least allow you to change channel, go to the guide,
[00:42:04.140 --> 00:42:06.140]   and do some of the basic directional functions.
[00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:06.500]   You know what?
[00:42:06.500 --> 00:42:09.700]   I like the idea of maybe an iPad that I leave on--
[00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:10.220]   Right.
[00:42:10.220 --> 00:42:12.100]   I've got to control the Apple TV.
[00:42:12.100 --> 00:42:14.340]   They just released that app like last week or whatever.
[00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:16.740]   And, you know, soon the Android tablets will be able--
[00:42:16.740 --> 00:42:18.140]   or Google OS or Chrome OS.
[00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:18.660]   Of course.
[00:42:18.660 --> 00:42:22.020]   Of course, that's a $500 minimum, $500 remote control.
[00:42:22.020 --> 00:42:22.540]   Yeah.
[00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:23.060]   Yes.
[00:42:23.060 --> 00:42:26.860]   Google's other special-- especially these days is voice.
[00:42:26.860 --> 00:42:28.060]   They showed that off, Jeff.
[00:42:28.060 --> 00:42:29.260]   I'm glad you mentioned it.
[00:42:29.260 --> 00:42:30.260]   They did.
[00:42:30.260 --> 00:42:31.900]   And unfortunately, I didn't get it on tape.
[00:42:31.900 --> 00:42:35.060]   Instead of you me, it's Goomy.
[00:42:35.060 --> 00:42:36.060]   Goomy?
[00:42:36.060 --> 00:42:36.540]   No.
[00:42:36.540 --> 00:42:36.540]   No.
[00:42:36.540 --> 00:42:37.060]   No.
[00:42:37.060 --> 00:42:37.060]   No.
[00:42:37.060 --> 00:42:37.540]   No.
[00:42:37.540 --> 00:42:38.220]   Goomy interface.
[00:42:38.220 --> 00:42:38.740]   No.
[00:42:38.740 --> 00:42:42.060]   He basically said, price is right into his Android phone
[00:42:42.060 --> 00:42:44.460]   by hitting the Google Voice Actions button.
[00:42:44.460 --> 00:42:46.460]   And it pulled it right up on the Google TV.
[00:42:46.460 --> 00:42:47.740]   It's got a dictate, but it all-- OK.
[00:42:47.740 --> 00:42:50.140]   So you can dict-- and it looked like it did a pretty good job
[00:42:50.140 --> 00:42:51.300]   with the demos I saw.
[00:42:51.300 --> 00:42:52.540]   Like you would literally-- it would say--
[00:42:52.540 --> 00:42:55.100]   and we've seen the Google phones now do a very good job,
[00:42:55.100 --> 00:42:55.460]   I think.
[00:42:55.460 --> 00:42:57.340]   Yeah, especially when they're cross-referencing a database
[00:42:57.340 --> 00:42:58.340]   to know a universe.
[00:42:58.340 --> 00:42:59.500]   Price is right.
[00:42:59.500 --> 00:42:59.820]   Right.
[00:42:59.820 --> 00:43:01.100]   It's going to be-- you know, there's
[00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:04.020]   a much more constrained possibilities.
[00:43:04.020 --> 00:43:05.740]   It's Star Trek time.
[00:43:05.740 --> 00:43:09.540]   And it has an available camera.
[00:43:09.540 --> 00:43:11.180]   It has all those additional features
[00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:13.020]   which work with Google Chat.
[00:43:13.020 --> 00:43:16.300]   So you don't need-- I think Umi is kind of the loser
[00:43:16.300 --> 00:43:17.260]   in this one, the Cisco.
[00:43:17.260 --> 00:43:18.340]   Umi.
[00:43:18.340 --> 00:43:20.660]   For $2.99, I guess you have to buy the camera, which
[00:43:20.660 --> 00:43:24.300]   is another 150, I think, something like that, from Google.
[00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:25.260]   They had the whole-- you know what?
[00:43:25.260 --> 00:43:26.220]   You can go to the website.
[00:43:26.220 --> 00:43:27.860]   Logitech put this all up at a time.
[00:43:27.860 --> 00:43:30.220]   But because it's an ecosystem, there's
[00:43:30.220 --> 00:43:33.300]   nothing to say that there couldn't be some future consolidation.
[00:43:33.300 --> 00:43:35.580]   What about the front-facing camera in your Android phone
[00:43:35.580 --> 00:43:37.340]   being the camera you used to talk to grandma,
[00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:38.900]   and you see her on the set?
[00:43:38.900 --> 00:43:42.500]   Oh, and now I'm holding a microphone and camera right next to me.
[00:43:42.500 --> 00:43:43.000]   Yeah.
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:44.260]   It's a problem located on the eye, then.
[00:43:44.260 --> 00:43:46.220]   I think the real weakness of this Logitech box
[00:43:46.220 --> 00:43:48.900]   is actually the fact that Google TV is a platform.
[00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:50.740]   It's not one box in particular.
[00:43:50.740 --> 00:43:52.900]   So soon, in the next couple months or whatever,
[00:43:52.900 --> 00:43:54.740]   it's going to be built into Sony TVs.
[00:43:54.740 --> 00:43:56.660]   It's going to be built into Sony Blu-ray players.
[00:43:56.660 --> 00:43:59.180]   So why do you buy this $2.99, even if it's subsidized?
[00:43:59.180 --> 00:44:01.900]   Why do you buy this $150 box when you can either get it
[00:44:01.900 --> 00:44:03.900]   in a new TV or get it in a Blu-ray player?
[00:44:03.900 --> 00:44:04.780]   I think you can see this.
[00:44:04.780 --> 00:44:06.220]   Or get it in your Android phone.
[00:44:06.220 --> 00:44:07.820]   That's exactly right, Jeff.
[00:44:07.820 --> 00:44:10.260]   They're going to market apps that are much more expensive,
[00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:14.740]   that will control your Sony TV, that will be Logitech branded,
[00:44:14.740 --> 00:44:17.260]   that are running, that are Android apps that will run all
[00:44:17.260 --> 00:44:18.460]   of your other devices.
[00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:20.220]   What other manufacturers back here
[00:44:20.220 --> 00:44:22.900]   announced to be making Google TV boxes?
[00:44:22.900 --> 00:44:24.820]   Sony has an announcement next week.
[00:44:24.820 --> 00:44:26.420]   That's the only one I know for sure.
[00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:29.540]   So Sony is at the Google bio conference.
[00:44:29.540 --> 00:44:31.860]   They announced Sony, Dish, and Logitech.
[00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:33.420]   Those are the three players.
[00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:36.900]   And then President of Best Buy was there to accept bribes
[00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:37.860]   from all three.
[00:44:37.860 --> 00:44:40.060]   Well, I think Samsung is going to be in a hell of a place
[00:44:40.060 --> 00:44:41.780]   because they have their own apps store.
[00:44:41.780 --> 00:44:44.260]   And they are going to end up having to make a call.
[00:44:44.260 --> 00:44:46.700]   They put a ton of R&D money into that already.
[00:44:46.700 --> 00:44:50.620]   And if they're not going to accept the Google TV UI,
[00:44:50.620 --> 00:44:51.940]   they're going to be out on a limb.
[00:44:51.940 --> 00:44:55.140]   And I wouldn't want to be making that decision.
[00:44:55.140 --> 00:45:00.340]   Well, the Amazon app marketplace also makes sense now.
[00:45:00.340 --> 00:45:02.420]   Because of its ubiquitous?
[00:45:02.420 --> 00:45:04.780]   Well, that-- yeah, Amazon's a brand we know.
[00:45:04.780 --> 00:45:08.860]   And Amazon can get you to get to all their entertainment
[00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:10.020]   through their app marketplace.
[00:45:10.020 --> 00:45:10.860]   Yeah.
[00:45:10.860 --> 00:45:11.380]   So--
[00:45:11.380 --> 00:45:12.460]   On Easter Bites.
[00:45:12.460 --> 00:45:13.580]   So that's an interesting--
[00:45:13.580 --> 00:45:15.340]   But what you don't want is more fragmentation.
[00:45:15.340 --> 00:45:17.580]   And that's really-- one of the things we're really headed
[00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:18.860]   towards is more fragmented.
[00:45:18.860 --> 00:45:20.500]   The Geek Squad wins out big on this one.
[00:45:20.500 --> 00:45:21.060]   Oh, man.
[00:45:21.060 --> 00:45:23.660]   Just these stars are going to go crazy.
[00:45:23.660 --> 00:45:24.220]   Now, you can--
[00:45:24.220 --> 00:45:26.380]   Their old black ties are just twirling right now.
[00:45:26.380 --> 00:45:29.580]   Oh, I'm so excited.
[00:45:29.580 --> 00:45:31.100]   So it's job security.
[00:45:31.100 --> 00:45:32.660]   So $2.99.99.
[00:45:32.660 --> 00:45:34.260]   You can order it now.
[00:45:34.260 --> 00:45:35.540]   When are they going to have it available?
[00:45:35.540 --> 00:45:36.580]   End of October.
[00:45:36.580 --> 00:45:38.500]   It's pre-orders now at Logitech.
[00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:40.580]   And I believe it Best Buy.
[00:45:40.580 --> 00:45:41.740]   OK, Leo.
[00:45:41.740 --> 00:45:42.740]   I ordered it already.
[00:45:42.740 --> 00:45:43.980]   Let's you buy one thing.
[00:45:43.980 --> 00:45:44.620]   Just one thing.
[00:45:44.620 --> 00:45:44.900]   Let's see.
[00:45:44.900 --> 00:45:47.540]   My wife doesn't.
[00:45:47.540 --> 00:45:48.940]   That's the problem.
[00:45:48.940 --> 00:45:49.860]   OK, go ahead, Jeff.
[00:45:49.860 --> 00:45:51.660]   I understand this is hypothetical.
[00:45:51.660 --> 00:45:52.180]   Yeah.
[00:45:52.180 --> 00:45:53.380]   What are you buying?
[00:45:53.380 --> 00:45:55.340]   People are going to come to you and say, Leo, what do I do?
[00:45:55.340 --> 00:45:58.380]   Apple TV, Roku, Boxy, this.
[00:45:58.380 --> 00:46:00.580]   I really like the simplicity of Roku.
[00:46:00.580 --> 00:46:04.340]   I think Roku beats Apple TV, at least for me right now.
[00:46:04.340 --> 00:46:06.100]   But I have to say, I think the potential
[00:46:06.100 --> 00:46:09.300]   is here for Google TV.
[00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:11.220]   The thing that Apple TV didn't do that was disappointed
[00:46:11.220 --> 00:46:11.980]   was have apps.
[00:46:11.980 --> 00:46:15.420]   Now, I suspect we haven't heard the end of that one.
[00:46:15.420 --> 00:46:19.500]   I think there's eight gigs of storage on that Apple TV.
[00:46:19.500 --> 00:46:20.860]   We already know you can install apps.
[00:46:20.860 --> 00:46:21.900]   There's just no app launcher.
[00:46:21.900 --> 00:46:24.340]   It's a simple firmware button to push for Apple
[00:46:24.340 --> 00:46:25.740]   to make apps on this thing.
[00:46:25.740 --> 00:46:28.660]   At first, your apps are probably resident on your iPad.
[00:46:28.660 --> 00:46:30.660]   Then go through Apple TV.
[00:46:30.660 --> 00:46:33.460]   Well, apparently there is some facility to do that.
[00:46:33.460 --> 00:46:34.900]   That's another way to go.
[00:46:34.900 --> 00:46:38.140]   I'm glad I don't have to choose, Jeff, to be honest.
[00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:40.140]   I don't think there's a clear winner here yet.
[00:46:40.140 --> 00:46:41.340]   But I think that--
[00:46:41.340 --> 00:46:44.380]   Well, it's a good question, Jeff, because I feel like I'm
[00:46:44.380 --> 00:46:47.140]   going to have to make this decision advising on--
[00:46:47.140 --> 00:46:47.660]   Yeah.
[00:46:47.660 --> 00:46:49.020]   --good more America, like, OK, America.
[00:46:49.020 --> 00:46:51.500]   If you get by one thing for holiday.
[00:46:51.500 --> 00:46:54.060]   And what I will say is, I feel like we're back
[00:46:54.060 --> 00:46:56.540]   to the format wars.
[00:46:56.540 --> 00:46:59.220]   And so in the transition space, while they're fought,
[00:46:59.220 --> 00:47:03.580]   I actually think this Google TV Logitech device is the best
[00:47:03.580 --> 00:47:07.540]   consumer choice, because it solves two problems.
[00:47:07.540 --> 00:47:09.940]   One, it's an all-in-one streaming solution
[00:47:09.940 --> 00:47:12.100]   that may very well be future-proofed enough
[00:47:12.100 --> 00:47:15.500]   to take us into the next three, four years.
[00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:19.820]   Secondarily, it solves the universal remote problem.
[00:47:19.820 --> 00:47:24.060]   And I think that if it can consolidate those two issues,
[00:47:24.060 --> 00:47:26.260]   it's worth the investment, especially if it's
[00:47:26.260 --> 00:47:28.660]   subsidized by your satellite or cable provider.
[00:47:28.660 --> 00:47:29.160]   Right.
[00:47:29.160 --> 00:47:29.660]   Look at this.
[00:47:29.660 --> 00:47:32.380]   It's got two USB ports in the back, which, unlike Apple,
[00:47:32.380 --> 00:47:34.780]   USB port actually does something.
[00:47:34.780 --> 00:47:37.740]   You can hook a camera up to it, among other things.
[00:47:37.740 --> 00:47:41.700]   IR blaster support, HDMI.
[00:47:41.700 --> 00:47:44.340]   Yeah, this is what's interesting,
[00:47:44.340 --> 00:47:47.860]   is it's also a big win for Logitech's Harmony line, which
[00:47:47.860 --> 00:47:50.980]   we've said for a long time is absolutely the best remote
[00:47:50.980 --> 00:47:52.540]   control system out there.
[00:47:52.540 --> 00:47:54.020]   There is no doubt it's the best.
[00:47:54.020 --> 00:47:56.580]   It's still too hard for the average consumer.
[00:47:56.580 --> 00:47:57.740]   Right.
[00:47:57.740 --> 00:47:58.260]   I agree.
[00:47:58.260 --> 00:48:02.580]   This is the power of choice.
[00:48:02.580 --> 00:48:04.820]   Becky, you're right.
[00:48:04.820 --> 00:48:07.980]   The decade of the blinking 12.
[00:48:07.980 --> 00:48:08.980]   We're back to that.
[00:48:08.980 --> 00:48:09.980]   No.
[00:48:09.980 --> 00:48:13.300]   NCRs didn't figure out early on how to listen to a signal
[00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:15.500]   to get the time and just put the damn time in.
[00:48:15.500 --> 00:48:17.660]   And how many years did it take for the consumer electronics
[00:48:17.660 --> 00:48:19.060]   industry to get there?
[00:48:19.060 --> 00:48:21.100]   And in every household, there's only one person who
[00:48:21.100 --> 00:48:22.580]   knows how to program the damn thing.
[00:48:22.580 --> 00:48:25.500]   And it's like a ball and chain.
[00:48:25.500 --> 00:48:27.780]   Because you're the one person I take it.
[00:48:27.780 --> 00:48:29.980]   That would be.
[00:48:29.980 --> 00:48:33.740]   Have you guys seen the Sony Google TV remote that I think
[00:48:33.740 --> 00:48:34.980]   and gadget had pictures of yesterday?
[00:48:34.980 --> 00:48:38.380]   The ugliest thing I've ever seen in my life.
[00:48:38.380 --> 00:48:40.300]   This looks 1,000 times better.
[00:48:40.300 --> 00:48:41.700]   This Logitech remote looks funny.
[00:48:41.700 --> 00:48:43.220]   It's so funny.
[00:48:43.220 --> 00:48:44.660]   Sony, it's baloney.
[00:48:44.660 --> 00:48:46.460]   This looks like something--
[00:48:46.460 --> 00:48:49.260]   well, it looks like a remote control vehicle controller.
[00:48:49.260 --> 00:48:50.180]   I mean, it's crazy.
[00:48:50.180 --> 00:48:51.020]   You've got that A.R.
[00:48:51.020 --> 00:48:52.020]   Can you fly?
[00:48:52.020 --> 00:48:52.900]   Flying around you.
[00:48:52.900 --> 00:48:54.900]   You've got some sort of plane that it's controlling
[00:48:54.900 --> 00:48:56.460]   while you're watching TV.
[00:48:56.460 --> 00:48:57.380]   Watching it?
[00:48:57.380 --> 00:49:00.220]   They thought like functional designers,
[00:49:00.220 --> 00:49:01.220]   rather than consumers.
[00:49:01.220 --> 00:49:02.260]   Put that in there.
[00:49:02.260 --> 00:49:03.140]   Put that in there.
[00:49:03.140 --> 00:49:04.340]   It's all in there.
[00:49:04.340 --> 00:49:05.020]   You can't use it.
[00:49:05.020 --> 00:49:07.580]   The different looks a little kindle one-ish to me.
[00:49:07.580 --> 00:49:08.580]   Oh, yeah.
[00:49:08.580 --> 00:49:09.340]   That's exactly it.
[00:49:09.340 --> 00:49:12.580]   They took some sort of a gaming console controller,
[00:49:12.580 --> 00:49:15.380]   and they glued it to the kindle one bottom half.
[00:49:15.380 --> 00:49:16.860]   Ew.
[00:49:16.860 --> 00:49:17.340]   Ew.
[00:49:17.340 --> 00:49:18.580]   Exactly what it is.
[00:49:18.580 --> 00:49:19.580]   Ew.
[00:49:19.580 --> 00:49:21.020]   Of course, Sony.
[00:49:21.020 --> 00:49:23.100]   Yeah, I think Sony's kind of out in the cold on this one,
[00:49:23.100 --> 00:49:24.260]   to be honest with you.
[00:49:24.260 --> 00:49:26.140]   But every TV manufacturer is going
[00:49:26.140 --> 00:49:28.060]   to put something like this into their TV.
[00:49:28.060 --> 00:49:29.460]   And that's the other problem is that I
[00:49:29.460 --> 00:49:32.620]   don't think consumers, if they have a TV that does something,
[00:49:32.620 --> 00:49:34.580]   are going to buy something else.
[00:49:34.580 --> 00:49:37.180]   So now you've really got a fragmentation of the market.
[00:49:37.180 --> 00:49:38.220]   Well, what you have to have--
[00:49:38.220 --> 00:49:39.460]   I think Becky's on the pointer.
[00:49:39.460 --> 00:49:43.580]   You have to have some hub controller for all your stuff.
[00:49:43.580 --> 00:49:46.580]   Well, you don't, though, if you get a TV with Yahoo widgets,
[00:49:46.580 --> 00:49:49.500]   or you get a TV with the Samsung tools,
[00:49:49.500 --> 00:49:51.100]   that's the same--
[00:49:51.100 --> 00:49:54.820]   but you're also going to still have a DVD player for a year or two.
[00:49:54.820 --> 00:49:55.980]   You're going to have--
[00:49:55.980 --> 00:49:56.860]   But those are fake--
[00:49:56.860 --> 00:49:59.660]   I do believe those will fade away.
[00:49:59.660 --> 00:50:02.500]   Maybe even-- I mean, one can hope the cable box.
[00:50:02.500 --> 00:50:03.500]   Right, but that's what I'm saying.
[00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:07.620]   But that's where I think the hub is now.
[00:50:07.620 --> 00:50:10.860]   The exhaustion of hooking up one more thing
[00:50:10.860 --> 00:50:11.620]   is too much to bear.
[00:50:11.620 --> 00:50:12.460]   I agree.
[00:50:12.460 --> 00:50:14.180]   So you buy the TV with it installed.
[00:50:14.180 --> 00:50:15.460]   That's what I'm saying is--
[00:50:15.460 --> 00:50:16.020]   Yeah.
[00:50:16.020 --> 00:50:16.540]   OK.
[00:50:16.540 --> 00:50:19.100]   If you buy a TV and it's got this stuff,
[00:50:19.100 --> 00:50:21.180]   you're not going to-- I don't care if something has better
[00:50:21.180 --> 00:50:21.620]   features.
[00:50:21.620 --> 00:50:22.580]   You're done.
[00:50:22.580 --> 00:50:22.980]   Yeah.
[00:50:22.980 --> 00:50:25.100]   So we're going to have this very fragmented market.
[00:50:25.100 --> 00:50:26.540]   Now, who this benefits, I think,
[00:50:26.540 --> 00:50:29.460]   is people like Netflix and Hulu,
[00:50:29.460 --> 00:50:31.260]   because they're going to be in the driver's seat.
[00:50:31.260 --> 00:50:34.140]   Everybody's going to have to go to-- everybody-- everybody
[00:50:34.140 --> 00:50:38.420]   is now calling on Hulu, right, MG, and saying, OK, please,
[00:50:38.420 --> 00:50:40.700]   please, please let us have Hulu.
[00:50:40.700 --> 00:50:41.660]   Hulu is the one.
[00:50:41.660 --> 00:50:44.900]   They're kind of-- everyone is after them right now,
[00:50:44.900 --> 00:50:46.500]   because that's a big differentiating factor.
[00:50:46.500 --> 00:50:47.820]   Everyone, it seems like, has Netflix.
[00:50:47.820 --> 00:50:49.660]   I mean, all these things we talk about Netflix--
[00:50:49.660 --> 00:50:51.580]   Netflix turned out to be too easy.
[00:50:51.580 --> 00:50:52.420]   Hulu did the right thing.
[00:50:52.420 --> 00:50:54.420]   They held out.
[00:50:54.420 --> 00:50:57.380]   I think one big differentiating factor
[00:50:57.380 --> 00:50:59.900]   that's going to come into play-- and you hit on it
[00:50:59.900 --> 00:51:00.620]   a little bit, Leo.
[00:51:00.620 --> 00:51:03.260]   But if Apple launches apps for this,
[00:51:03.260 --> 00:51:05.300]   and we already know that Google is going to launch apps
[00:51:05.300 --> 00:51:08.580]   for the Logitech box and all the different Google TV
[00:51:08.580 --> 00:51:11.300]   platforms, a lot of people might end up buying these set
[00:51:11.300 --> 00:51:12.860]   top boxes just to get apps.
[00:51:12.860 --> 00:51:15.540]   The wild card there is how you actually control these apps.
[00:51:15.540 --> 00:51:17.420]   Do you use an iPad to do it?
[00:51:17.420 --> 00:51:19.980]   I mean, can you imagine using that keyboard thing
[00:51:19.980 --> 00:51:22.020]   to try and play a game on your TV?
[00:51:22.020 --> 00:51:24.300]   Do you have to have another remote then to do that?
[00:51:24.300 --> 00:51:26.980]   But I think that will be really interesting in the next six
[00:51:26.980 --> 00:51:29.420]   months to a year to see how that kind of comes into play.
[00:51:29.420 --> 00:51:33.060]   Stories today are that Apple TV is selling so well they--
[00:51:33.060 --> 00:51:34.980]   don't keep it in stock in some Apple stores.
[00:51:34.980 --> 00:51:38.180]   It is a hit out of the box already,
[00:51:38.180 --> 00:51:41.380]   with as many as a million units sold already.
[00:51:41.380 --> 00:51:44.420]   So they may just have the momentum.
[00:51:44.420 --> 00:51:48.620]   And if they can pull in apps, maybe they can win that one.
[00:51:48.620 --> 00:51:50.020]   I love this battle, by the way.
[00:51:50.020 --> 00:51:51.940]   First of all, it's great for us because we've
[00:51:51.940 --> 00:51:54.740]   got something to talk about.
[00:51:54.740 --> 00:51:56.260]   Press loves horse races, right?
[00:51:56.260 --> 00:51:59.180]   And we've got an 18 player horse race here.
[00:51:59.180 --> 00:52:01.140]   But it's also good, I think, for consumers in the long run
[00:52:01.140 --> 00:52:02.540]   because the competition--
[00:52:02.540 --> 00:52:04.740]   I know it's confusing initially, but the competition will,
[00:52:04.740 --> 00:52:07.540]   I think, ring itself out and we will get a low price good
[00:52:07.540 --> 00:52:09.100]   solution eventually out of all this.
[00:52:09.100 --> 00:52:10.780]   I hope we do.
[00:52:10.780 --> 00:52:11.940]   I mean, this is where we're heading.
[00:52:11.940 --> 00:52:13.860]   We're heading towards streaming content, period.
[00:52:13.860 --> 00:52:15.620]   There's no doubt about that.
[00:52:15.620 --> 00:52:20.820]   It's also very good for people like me and TechCrunch TV
[00:52:20.820 --> 00:52:25.500]   and anybody and Fast Company because as internet content
[00:52:25.500 --> 00:52:28.980]   providers, we're suddenly at parity with NBC, CBS.
[00:52:28.980 --> 00:52:32.460]   So by the way, have you done deals with Google TV and Boxy
[00:52:32.460 --> 00:52:33.500]   and all these kinds?
[00:52:33.500 --> 00:52:35.780]   Just Roku.
[00:52:35.780 --> 00:52:36.780]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:52:36.780 --> 00:52:37.900]   What does it take for you?
[00:52:37.900 --> 00:52:39.380]   You should just be there.
[00:52:39.380 --> 00:52:40.340]   I think we're just there.
[00:52:40.340 --> 00:52:41.500]   It's a deal even necessary.
[00:52:41.500 --> 00:52:43.340]   I'll tell you, on the Apple TV, you plug it in,
[00:52:43.340 --> 00:52:44.540]   you go to the podcast section.
[00:52:44.540 --> 00:52:45.140]   We're featured.
[00:52:45.140 --> 00:52:46.100]   All of our shows are there.
[00:52:46.100 --> 00:52:48.380]   It's very easy to play them.
[00:52:48.380 --> 00:52:50.820]   We are in the Roku box because our partner Media Flies
[00:52:50.820 --> 00:52:54.980]   made deals with popcorn hour Roku box and Yahoo.
[00:52:54.980 --> 00:52:57.860]   There is a Boxy content plug-in, I believe.
[00:52:57.860 --> 00:52:59.940]   So we will be on the Boxy box at ship.
[00:52:59.940 --> 00:53:03.060]   That's a third party content plug-in.
[00:53:03.060 --> 00:53:05.060]   I don't know if Google-- we even need to do anything
[00:53:05.060 --> 00:53:05.820]   for Google TV.
[00:53:05.820 --> 00:53:07.300]   You speak into your phone.
[00:53:07.300 --> 00:53:10.780]   You say, this week in Google, and presumably, it would pop up
[00:53:10.780 --> 00:53:11.780]   and you'd play it.
[00:53:11.780 --> 00:53:13.860]   Either listen or your Twit app, right?
[00:53:13.860 --> 00:53:14.820]   I mean, is it--
[00:53:14.820 --> 00:53:16.540]   And there is a Twit app for Android.
[00:53:16.540 --> 00:53:18.020]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:53:18.020 --> 00:53:20.340]   So we have apps on all the platforms.
[00:53:20.340 --> 00:53:21.660]   So I think that--
[00:53:21.660 --> 00:53:22.380]   Big girl, okay then.
[00:53:22.380 --> 00:53:22.580]   Go ahead.
[00:53:22.580 --> 00:53:24.100]   Yeah, anybody wants to play in this space.
[00:53:24.100 --> 00:53:26.620]   It's really a very low barrier to entry.
[00:53:26.620 --> 00:53:27.660]   I don't think you need to do much.
[00:53:27.660 --> 00:53:30.380]   And that's where the search-- see, Google's smart because--
[00:53:30.380 --> 00:53:30.820]   Search.
[00:53:30.820 --> 00:53:31.980]   You don't need to curate.
[00:53:31.980 --> 00:53:34.700]   You just allow people to search.
[00:53:34.700 --> 00:53:35.220]   Awesome.
[00:53:35.220 --> 00:53:36.220]   Then there's the question.
[00:53:36.220 --> 00:53:38.820]   Where does Facebook plan this?
[00:53:38.820 --> 00:53:41.060]   No, because it's down to Zuckerberg.
[00:53:41.060 --> 00:53:43.180]   Everything comes down to Zuckerberg.
[00:53:43.180 --> 00:53:44.820]   I asked about that in the Google TV,
[00:53:44.820 --> 00:53:47.220]   and they said you just go to it in the browser that they're
[00:53:47.220 --> 00:53:48.340]   not-- they didn't talk about apps.
[00:53:48.340 --> 00:53:48.820]   They have a full browser.
[00:53:48.820 --> 00:53:49.820]   Yeah, but I think it's reverse Becky.
[00:53:49.820 --> 00:53:53.020]   I think that the powerful thing here is the social search.
[00:53:53.020 --> 00:53:56.180]   I've been arguing in one of my really boring PowerPoint
[00:53:56.180 --> 00:54:00.820]   slides that there's new spheres of discovery of content.
[00:54:00.820 --> 00:54:02.340]   So brand used to be it.
[00:54:02.340 --> 00:54:03.860]   That's why the way media still thinks.
[00:54:03.860 --> 00:54:06.300]   As we go to the programmer's schedule,
[00:54:06.300 --> 00:54:08.620]   we buy the magazine, we buy the newspaper.
[00:54:08.620 --> 00:54:10.900]   That's a search reverse that.
[00:54:10.900 --> 00:54:12.980]   We ask the question, if you got an answer, you're there.
[00:54:12.980 --> 00:54:14.580]   If you don't exist.
[00:54:14.580 --> 00:54:16.580]   The more powerful force that comes along
[00:54:16.580 --> 00:54:18.780]   is, of course, the human links.
[00:54:18.780 --> 00:54:21.140]   Oh, imagine instead of living in Google TV,
[00:54:21.140 --> 00:54:22.740]   you live in Facebook TV.
[00:54:22.740 --> 00:54:23.740]   In your--
[00:54:23.740 --> 00:54:25.300]   You know, that group that you just started
[00:54:25.300 --> 00:54:26.860]   with, like, OMG, if it's a group of my friends,
[00:54:26.860 --> 00:54:28.460]   and I can see who's watching what.
[00:54:28.460 --> 00:54:31.900]   We could be discussing True Blood while we're watching True Blood.
[00:54:31.900 --> 00:54:33.900]   I think that's very powerful.
[00:54:33.900 --> 00:54:34.340]   It was--
[00:54:34.340 --> 00:54:35.340]   That's where it all takes all of it.
[00:54:35.340 --> 00:54:36.220]   It's kind of interesting.
[00:54:36.220 --> 00:54:38.100]   The guy who's leading Facebook groups
[00:54:38.100 --> 00:54:41.020]   is the same guy who created hot potato.
[00:54:41.020 --> 00:54:42.020]   Facebook acquired them.
[00:54:42.020 --> 00:54:44.380]   And that was kind of one of their thing
[00:54:44.380 --> 00:54:45.180]   that they were doing.
[00:54:45.180 --> 00:54:47.060]   You could check into watching a television show
[00:54:47.060 --> 00:54:48.380]   and have conversations about it.
[00:54:48.380 --> 00:54:50.060]   So that's kind of interesting.
[00:54:50.060 --> 00:54:53.860]   I think that's so key for both discovery and socialization
[00:54:53.860 --> 00:54:56.020]   of the event, and for creating things that are social,
[00:54:56.020 --> 00:54:58.420]   all starts to come together.
[00:54:58.420 --> 00:55:00.140]   The stat that I throw out regularly
[00:55:00.140 --> 00:55:03.420]   is that Schmidt says that Google causes 4 billion clicks
[00:55:03.420 --> 00:55:06.500]   of months in publishers, bitly past that mark a few months ago.
[00:55:06.500 --> 00:55:07.500]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:55:07.500 --> 00:55:08.900]   Apple's to come, quads, I admit.
[00:55:08.900 --> 00:55:10.180]   It's not all the publishers.
[00:55:10.180 --> 00:55:13.260]   But you consider bitly is only a fraction of Twitter
[00:55:13.260 --> 00:55:15.660]   and Twitter is a fraction the size of Facebook.
[00:55:15.660 --> 00:55:18.420]   So the human links become the primary means
[00:55:18.420 --> 00:55:20.820]   of media discovery in the future.
[00:55:20.820 --> 00:55:22.180]   It's not brands.
[00:55:22.180 --> 00:55:23.460]   It's not curators.
[00:55:23.460 --> 00:55:24.780]   It's not search, though.
[00:55:24.780 --> 00:55:27.100]   Each of those will still live and have a major report board.
[00:55:27.100 --> 00:55:30.140]   But the market share is going to go more and more and more
[00:55:30.140 --> 00:55:34.060]   to human links, peer links, interaction,
[00:55:34.060 --> 00:55:37.420]   or an analyzing what we're talking about and seeing
[00:55:37.420 --> 00:55:38.820]   heat there.
[00:55:38.820 --> 00:55:41.540]   It's a John Henry moment where the humans win.
[00:55:41.540 --> 00:55:42.900]   I like that.
[00:55:42.900 --> 00:55:44.100]   Becky Worley is going to leave us.
[00:55:44.100 --> 00:55:46.420]   She has to get ready for TNT Tech News today's coming up
[00:55:46.420 --> 00:55:47.220]   in about 20 minutes.
[00:55:47.220 --> 00:55:49.420]   So Becky, thank you for your coverage of this event.
[00:55:49.420 --> 00:55:50.660]   And we're glad we could get your video.
[00:55:50.660 --> 00:55:51.180]   Thank you.
[00:55:51.180 --> 00:55:51.780]   Thanks for having me.
[00:55:51.780 --> 00:55:51.980]   Thank you.
[00:55:51.980 --> 00:55:54.740]   Worley reports for Good Morning America for ABC News
[00:55:54.740 --> 00:55:56.540]   and is, of course, a regular on the Twitter network
[00:55:56.540 --> 00:55:58.180]   as part of our tech news today.
[00:55:58.180 --> 00:55:58.820]   Bye, Becky.
[00:55:58.820 --> 00:55:59.420]   I got thank you.
[00:55:59.420 --> 00:56:03.460]   And is the executive producer of Twitter.
[00:56:03.460 --> 00:56:06.900]   While Becky repositions--
[00:56:06.900 --> 00:56:07.620]   is that what it's called?
[00:56:07.620 --> 00:56:08.260]   Repositioning?
[00:56:08.260 --> 00:56:09.540]   I don't know what that's called.
[00:56:09.540 --> 00:56:12.340]   We're repositioning Becky for her next gig.
[00:56:12.340 --> 00:56:15.780]   I'm going to quickly take a look at our sponsor Gazelle.
[00:56:15.780 --> 00:56:19.580]   They do a great job if you've ever seen Gazelle.
[00:56:19.580 --> 00:56:22.940]   And helping you get rid of the gadgets you're done with.
[00:56:22.940 --> 00:56:26.260]   Gosh knows, there's plenty of gadgets in our lives today
[00:56:26.260 --> 00:56:29.100]   and plenty more that we don't need.
[00:56:29.100 --> 00:56:30.100]   You could recycle them.
[00:56:30.100 --> 00:56:30.940]   You could give them to friends.
[00:56:30.940 --> 00:56:31.380]   You could sell them.
[00:56:31.380 --> 00:56:32.500]   You could try to sell them on eBay.
[00:56:32.500 --> 00:56:33.660]   Or you could get a zellum.
[00:56:33.660 --> 00:56:34.260]   Don't sell them.
[00:56:34.260 --> 00:56:35.900]   Gazelleum.
[00:56:35.900 --> 00:56:39.900]   It's the easy way to get cash for your gadgets.
[00:56:39.900 --> 00:56:40.980]   Got an iPhone 3.
[00:56:40.980 --> 00:56:41.780]   You're ready to get rid of?
[00:56:41.780 --> 00:56:42.940]   So you can buy the iPhone 4.
[00:56:42.940 --> 00:56:46.500]   Let's just put in the iPhone 3.
[00:56:46.500 --> 00:56:47.220]   GS.
[00:56:47.220 --> 00:56:51.340]   You just put it in the search bar here.
[00:56:51.340 --> 00:56:56.380]   And you say, let's say I have a 32 gig, 3 GS.
[00:56:56.380 --> 00:56:57.140]   Does it make a call?
[00:56:57.140 --> 00:56:57.540]   Yes.
[00:56:57.540 --> 00:56:58.380]   Free of water damage.
[00:56:58.380 --> 00:56:58.980]   Yes.
[00:56:58.980 --> 00:56:59.740]   Perfect condition.
[00:56:59.740 --> 00:57:02.020]   I have all the cables because I am that kind of guy.
[00:57:02.020 --> 00:57:04.580]   And it is worth $222.
[00:57:04.580 --> 00:57:05.340]   Now here's what happens.
[00:57:05.340 --> 00:57:08.180]   Gazelle sends you a box with a return mail label.
[00:57:08.180 --> 00:57:10.100]   You throw that in and anything else you want.
[00:57:10.100 --> 00:57:12.620]   The Gazelle experts go over it, make sure it matches your specs.
[00:57:12.620 --> 00:57:15.020]   Remove all your personal data.
[00:57:15.020 --> 00:57:16.820]   And then they send you a check.
[00:57:16.820 --> 00:57:17.780]   It's that easy.
[00:57:17.780 --> 00:57:21.860]   And you're already there to buy in that next iPhone, the iPhone 4.
[00:57:21.860 --> 00:57:23.940]   G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.com.
[00:57:23.940 --> 00:57:25.740]   Lots of other reasons to love Gazelle.
[00:57:25.740 --> 00:57:28.620]   For instance, some of your gadgets, let's face it,
[00:57:28.620 --> 00:57:30.860]   have no value at all.
[00:57:30.860 --> 00:57:32.340]   Gazelle does recycling.
[00:57:32.340 --> 00:57:35.860]   Their Gazelle Recycle Network is made up
[00:57:35.860 --> 00:57:39.340]   of responsible recyclers.
[00:57:39.340 --> 00:57:43.300]   Folks who don't do landfill, they
[00:57:43.300 --> 00:57:46.740]   don't use child labor or prisoner label labor.
[00:57:46.740 --> 00:57:48.780]   They take care of your stuff.
[00:57:48.780 --> 00:57:51.220]   They're approved by the EPA.
[00:57:51.220 --> 00:57:54.420]   Gazelle Recycles for you as well.
[00:57:54.420 --> 00:57:56.300]   One more reason to love Gazelle.
[00:57:56.300 --> 00:57:59.740]   If you've got a charitable cause, a school group
[00:57:59.740 --> 00:58:02.260]   that you need to fund, you don't have to have a bake sale.
[00:58:02.260 --> 00:58:04.340]   Have a Gazelle gadget drive.
[00:58:04.340 --> 00:58:07.340]   They will create a personalized gadget drive web page for you.
[00:58:07.340 --> 00:58:09.140]   You send your donors to the page.
[00:58:09.140 --> 00:58:10.620]   They send their gadgets to Gazelle.
[00:58:10.620 --> 00:58:12.900]   You get the money.
[00:58:12.900 --> 00:58:16.460]   Easier than a bake sale and more--
[00:58:16.460 --> 00:58:19.180]   rewarding, less expensive than having an event.
[00:58:19.180 --> 00:58:20.180]   I love Gazelle.
[00:58:20.180 --> 00:58:21.300]   Lots of people have used it.
[00:58:21.300 --> 00:58:25.020]   We've used it many times now to get money for a lot of stuff
[00:58:25.020 --> 00:58:26.260]   lying around the cottage.
[00:58:26.260 --> 00:58:27.420]   Go to Gazelle.com.
[00:58:27.420 --> 00:58:28.140]   Don't sell it.
[00:58:28.140 --> 00:58:29.500]   Gazelle it.
[00:58:29.500 --> 00:58:32.940]   If you use the special code TWIG, after you've
[00:58:32.940 --> 00:58:36.220]   got all your items put together, you get a 5% bonus
[00:58:36.220 --> 00:58:38.220]   payment on your used gadgets.
[00:58:38.220 --> 00:58:40.340]   You can also get cash or get an Amazon card.
[00:58:40.340 --> 00:58:42.540]   They have other ways that you can get more money back
[00:58:42.540 --> 00:58:43.900]   for your gadgets.
[00:58:43.900 --> 00:58:45.020]   I really love Gazelle.
[00:58:45.020 --> 00:58:46.380]   Gee, I got to do this.
[00:58:46.380 --> 00:58:47.380]   It's so great.
[00:58:47.380 --> 00:58:48.900]   Yeah, it has so much stuff sitting around.
[00:58:48.900 --> 00:58:49.620]   I got to do this.
[00:58:49.620 --> 00:58:50.580]   We all do, right?
[00:58:50.580 --> 00:58:51.660]   And it's such a thing.
[00:58:51.660 --> 00:58:53.660]   My wife's going to go through every closet I have
[00:58:53.660 --> 00:58:55.420]   and just set it all without my permission.
[00:58:55.420 --> 00:58:56.140]   Well, she should.
[00:58:56.140 --> 00:58:58.820]   And you get this one box and you throw it all in the box
[00:58:58.820 --> 00:58:59.580]   and you send it to them.
[00:58:59.580 --> 00:59:00.460]   And they just send you a check.
[00:59:00.460 --> 00:59:02.260]   It couldn't be easier.
[00:59:02.260 --> 00:59:04.140]   gazelle.com.
[00:59:04.140 --> 00:59:05.940]   We thank them for their support of this weekend.
[00:59:05.940 --> 00:59:08.180]   I'll have to stop her from sending my Newton in.
[00:59:08.180 --> 00:59:09.860]   No, you're not getting my Newton.
[00:59:09.860 --> 00:59:11.500]   You know, I don't think it's worth anything anyway.
[00:59:11.500 --> 00:59:13.060]   Let me just say I got a curiosity.
[00:59:13.060 --> 00:59:14.860]   And EWTOA.
[00:59:14.860 --> 00:59:15.860]   It's kind of fun.
[00:59:15.860 --> 00:59:18.460]   Just go to the web page and play with it.
[00:59:18.460 --> 00:59:20.580]   Newton MessagePad 2100.
[00:59:20.580 --> 00:59:22.580]   Let's see what that's worth.
[00:59:22.580 --> 00:59:23.460]   That's just the one I got.
[00:59:23.460 --> 00:59:24.260]   Power's on.
[00:59:24.260 --> 00:59:25.940]   Free of water damage.
[00:59:25.940 --> 00:59:28.380]   It is in perfect condition because I never used it.
[00:59:28.380 --> 00:59:30.140]   AC adapter, rechargeable battery.
[00:59:30.140 --> 00:59:32.100]   I don't even know what this stuff is.
[00:59:32.100 --> 00:59:34.460]   But yeah, let's say I have everything.
[00:59:34.460 --> 00:59:36.620]   It is worth 81 bucks.
[00:59:36.620 --> 00:59:38.060]   I'm kind of surprised.
[00:59:38.060 --> 00:59:39.820]   Hey, that's pretty good.
[00:59:39.820 --> 00:59:41.660]   And then there's this graph at the bottom
[00:59:41.660 --> 00:59:42.940]   that shows you how the value.
[00:59:42.940 --> 00:59:48.860]   For some reason, in August, the value of the Newton went up.
[00:59:48.860 --> 00:59:51.780]   Wow, 87 bucks for some reason, the projected price.
[00:59:51.780 --> 00:59:53.740]   And then it dropped again.
[00:59:53.740 --> 00:59:58.140]   But get it before it because it's projected to drop to $3.
[00:59:58.140 --> 00:59:58.940]   In X-1.
[00:59:58.940 --> 01:00:01.580]   So if you do have a Newton and you don't want it,
[01:00:01.580 --> 01:00:02.420]   sell it now.
[01:00:02.420 --> 01:00:03.340]   I love this.
[01:00:03.340 --> 01:00:05.180]   I'm not sure how that works, but that's so cool.
[01:00:05.180 --> 01:00:09.020]   They have price history today's price and projected price.
[01:00:09.020 --> 01:00:11.100]   Anyway, enough of that.
[01:00:11.100 --> 01:00:12.740]   You're watching Twig.
[01:00:12.740 --> 01:00:15.780]   MG Seagler is the heavy breather in the background there
[01:00:15.780 --> 01:00:16.500]   from TechCrunch.
[01:00:16.500 --> 01:00:17.020]   Is that me?
[01:00:17.020 --> 01:00:18.060]   Yeah, I think it's you.
[01:00:18.060 --> 01:00:22.580]   Just move your head set down or up or something.
[01:00:22.580 --> 01:00:23.580]   Or calm down, empty.
[01:00:23.580 --> 01:00:24.260]   Just calm down.
[01:00:24.260 --> 01:00:25.460]   He's so excited.
[01:00:25.460 --> 01:00:28.900]   I'm not a Google TV product.
[01:00:28.900 --> 01:00:31.660]   He's from TechCrunch, and we love in TechCrunch.com.
[01:00:31.660 --> 01:00:34.900]   Also here, the great Jeff Jarvis back from traveling
[01:00:34.900 --> 01:00:35.860]   around the world.
[01:00:35.860 --> 01:00:38.740]   He's got his eyes propped open with toothpicks right now.
[01:00:38.740 --> 01:00:40.420]   His website, BuzzMachine.com.
[01:00:40.420 --> 01:00:42.340]   He's also the author of What Would Google Do?
[01:00:42.340 --> 01:00:45.140]   A great book if you're interested in what Google's up to.
[01:00:45.140 --> 01:00:48.180]   And Professor of Journalism at the City University of New York.
[01:00:48.180 --> 01:00:52.420]   Gina Trapani is also here from her home.
[01:00:52.420 --> 01:00:54.220]   Maybe that's you breathing heavily.
[01:00:54.220 --> 01:00:54.940]   Is it?
[01:00:54.940 --> 01:00:56.540]   Uh oh, usually I'm the heavy breather.
[01:00:56.540 --> 01:00:58.100]   So, you know.
[01:00:58.100 --> 01:01:01.060]   Her blog is smarterware.org.
[01:01:01.060 --> 01:01:05.580]   And fastcompany.com/worksmart.
[01:01:05.580 --> 01:01:06.020]   Let's see.
[01:01:06.020 --> 01:01:08.300]   I guess we could talk about other stuff.
[01:01:08.300 --> 01:01:09.940]   Are we done any last thoughts?
[01:01:09.940 --> 01:01:12.540]   Seven new Android phones from--
[01:01:12.540 --> 01:01:13.540]   Unbelievable.
[01:01:13.540 --> 01:01:14.260]   Now, we're tonight.
[01:01:14.260 --> 01:01:16.740]   We're going to be doing a live broadcast from CTIA in San
[01:01:16.740 --> 01:01:18.500]   Francisco, started at 730.
[01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:22.300]   And we will be showing you all the new phones at CTIA.
[01:01:22.300 --> 01:01:22.820]   Oh, good.
[01:01:22.820 --> 01:01:26.900]   Unbelievable array, including the Droid Pro, which I somehow
[01:01:26.900 --> 01:01:29.620]   Motorola kept secret for the longest time.
[01:01:29.620 --> 01:01:31.900]   It's obviously for the BlackBerry fan.
[01:01:31.900 --> 01:01:38.220]   Weren't there some numbers published about Android this week?
[01:01:38.220 --> 01:01:39.580]   That's my number of the week, Gina.
[01:01:39.580 --> 01:01:40.420]   Oh, sorry, sorry.
[01:01:40.420 --> 01:01:41.340]   I didn't say that.
[01:01:41.340 --> 01:01:45.020]   We don't mention numbers around here.
[01:01:45.020 --> 01:01:45.980]   You like the Droid Pro?
[01:01:45.980 --> 01:01:49.860]   That looks just like a torch to me.
[01:01:49.860 --> 01:01:52.380]   That's a Motorola device.
[01:01:52.380 --> 01:01:54.500]   BlackBerry focused.
[01:01:54.500 --> 01:01:55.940]   Gonna be Verizon, I think.
[01:01:55.940 --> 01:01:58.500]   Yeah.
[01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:01.340]   AT&T had three new Droid devices.
[01:02:01.340 --> 01:02:04.300]   I mean, if I'm Apple, I'm going, OK.
[01:02:04.300 --> 01:02:06.100]   You know, it reminds me so much--
[01:02:06.100 --> 01:02:06.980]   and I've said this before.
[01:02:06.980 --> 01:02:08.020]   I've known great insights.
[01:02:08.020 --> 01:02:11.580]   So much of the PC versus Mac Wars, where you could buy a PC
[01:02:11.580 --> 01:02:14.060]   from 8,000 manufacturers.
[01:02:14.060 --> 01:02:15.060]   Configure any way you want.
[01:02:15.060 --> 01:02:17.260]   And you get an Apple from Apple, exactly the way Apple
[01:02:17.260 --> 01:02:17.900]   configures it.
[01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:19.060]   Because Apple's software--
[01:02:19.060 --> 01:02:21.020]   And did you guys see the--
[01:02:21.020 --> 01:02:23.540]   it broke a couple hours ago, I think.
[01:02:23.540 --> 01:02:26.860]   Wall Street Journal has a story, suspiciously like it
[01:02:26.860 --> 01:02:30.460]   was leaked by Apple that the Verizon iPhone is definitely
[01:02:30.460 --> 01:02:32.420]   coming at the beginning of next year.
[01:02:32.420 --> 01:02:35.740]   The journal seems to be Apple's place of choice
[01:02:35.740 --> 01:02:36.940]   for leaking information.
[01:02:36.940 --> 01:02:38.980]   Well, it helps what Steve Jobs takes as helicopter
[01:02:38.980 --> 01:02:40.980]   to Rupert's retreats.
[01:02:40.980 --> 01:02:42.220]   And his hat.
[01:02:42.220 --> 01:02:43.780]   Did he wear his funny hat?
[01:02:43.780 --> 01:02:45.220]   I don't know.
[01:02:45.220 --> 01:02:45.780]   But dang.
[01:02:45.780 --> 01:02:49.620]   It's strange, top hat that he was wearing.
[01:02:49.620 --> 01:02:51.700]   Yeah, so Verizon will get the iPhone.
[01:02:51.700 --> 01:02:54.060]   I mean, if it's Apple, at this point, I think--
[01:02:54.060 --> 01:02:57.020]   we can say that Android is putting so much pressure on it.
[01:02:57.020 --> 01:02:58.260]   I think, I mean, if anything, I think
[01:02:58.260 --> 01:03:01.340]   the timing of this potential leak, whether it is or not,
[01:03:01.340 --> 01:03:05.140]   but is directly correlated to some of the news that came out
[01:03:05.140 --> 01:03:07.860]   today, which I think Jeff is going to talk to.
[01:03:07.860 --> 01:03:08.580]   That's what it is.
[01:03:08.580 --> 01:03:09.180]   Yes.
[01:03:09.180 --> 01:03:13.220]   I like the array of names for the new Motorola phones.
[01:03:13.220 --> 01:03:16.300]   You've got the Bravo, the Citrus, the DeFi, the Droid Pro,
[01:03:16.300 --> 01:03:20.420]   the Flipout, the Flipside, and the Spice.
[01:03:20.420 --> 01:03:22.460]   I'm surprised they don't have a poshy.
[01:03:22.460 --> 01:03:23.700]   It sounds like the Village people.
[01:03:23.700 --> 01:03:24.460]   Sporty.
[01:03:24.460 --> 01:03:25.700]   Yeah.
[01:03:25.700 --> 01:03:27.220]   Sounds like the Spice Girls.
[01:03:27.220 --> 01:03:29.260]   Or the posh-- yeah, the poshy rides better than posh.
[01:03:29.260 --> 01:03:29.620]   Yes.
[01:03:29.620 --> 01:03:32.660]   Bravo Spice, Citrus Spice, DeFi Spice, Droid Pro Spice,
[01:03:32.660 --> 01:03:34.940]   Flipout Spice, Flipside Spice, and Spice Spice.
[01:03:34.940 --> 01:03:37.500]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:03:37.500 --> 01:03:39.700]   Another good thing.
[01:03:39.700 --> 01:03:40.940]   They don't need to.
[01:03:40.940 --> 01:03:43.300]   Seven Android phones, three Bluetooth accessories,
[01:03:43.300 --> 01:03:44.740]   and that's just Motorola.
[01:03:44.740 --> 01:03:48.620]   Boy, am I wrong, but didn't Motorola a few years ago
[01:03:48.620 --> 01:03:51.780]   say we're getting out of the cell phone business entirely?
[01:03:51.780 --> 01:03:53.100]   I'm pretty sure they said that.
[01:03:53.100 --> 01:03:56.500]   And well, they're back, baby.
[01:03:56.500 --> 01:03:58.700]   Did HTC also announce a bunch of phones?
[01:03:58.700 --> 01:04:01.460]   I'm sure they did.
[01:04:01.460 --> 01:04:04.060]   It's kind of stunning.
[01:04:04.060 --> 01:04:06.780]   It's an onslaught.
[01:04:06.780 --> 01:04:09.100]   Skype for Android is out.
[01:04:09.100 --> 01:04:10.380]   I installed it immediately.
[01:04:10.380 --> 01:04:12.900]   Now, those of you with the Android phones of Verizon
[01:04:12.900 --> 01:04:14.660]   already had Skype mobile.
[01:04:14.660 --> 01:04:17.740]   But for those of you who are Android users not on Verizon,
[01:04:17.740 --> 01:04:21.620]   now you can make phone calls via Skype on Wi-Fi, or 3G,
[01:04:21.620 --> 01:04:25.940]   absolutely free if you're calling another Skype client,
[01:04:25.940 --> 01:04:29.580]   and very inexpensive as usual for the Skype out to phones.
[01:04:29.580 --> 01:04:30.100]   It's--
[01:04:30.100 --> 01:04:30.940]   Long time coming.
[01:04:30.940 --> 01:04:31.340]   Yeah.
[01:04:31.340 --> 01:04:33.900]   I mean, is there any reason why I would use that instead
[01:04:33.900 --> 01:04:36.620]   of Google Voice, which does kind of the same thing?
[01:04:36.620 --> 01:04:42.260]   You got the transcribed voicemail on stuff, right?
[01:04:42.260 --> 01:04:42.760]   Yeah.
[01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:44.340]   The Google Voice has more functionality.
[01:04:44.340 --> 01:04:46.260]   On the other hand, if I'm calling a Skype caller,
[01:04:46.260 --> 01:04:47.660]   I mean, it's good to have that.
[01:04:47.660 --> 01:04:48.160]   Right.
[01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:48.660]   Right.
[01:04:48.660 --> 01:04:49.160]   Right.
[01:04:49.160 --> 01:04:54.180]   And Google Voice does use a proper phone line, right?
[01:04:54.180 --> 01:04:55.420]   And it's kind of just data?
[01:04:55.420 --> 01:04:56.940]   It counts towards your minutes.
[01:04:56.940 --> 01:04:57.700]   Oh, it does.
[01:04:57.700 --> 01:04:58.540]   That's right.
[01:04:58.540 --> 01:04:59.540]   OK, there you go.
[01:04:59.540 --> 01:05:01.020]   That's a compelling reason.
[01:05:01.020 --> 01:05:03.500]   This does not count towards your minutes.
[01:05:03.500 --> 01:05:04.660]   And it works well.
[01:05:04.660 --> 01:05:05.220]   It's good.
[01:05:05.220 --> 01:05:07.300]   You need a strong 3G connection.
[01:05:07.300 --> 01:05:09.820]   And there's no skippyness or echoing.
[01:05:09.820 --> 01:05:10.580]   It's been good for you.
[01:05:10.580 --> 01:05:12.620]   Leo, I haven't had a chance to try it yet over 3G.
[01:05:12.620 --> 01:05:14.780]   I haven't called anybody with it myself.
[01:05:14.780 --> 01:05:16.740]   But who calls anybody anymore?
[01:05:16.740 --> 01:05:17.180]   I know.
[01:05:17.180 --> 01:05:18.860]   I haven't made a phone call in years.
[01:05:18.860 --> 01:05:19.300]   Yeah.
[01:05:19.300 --> 01:05:19.700]   No.
[01:05:19.700 --> 01:05:21.300]   What are you talking about?
[01:05:21.300 --> 01:05:22.020]   It doesn't work.
[01:05:22.020 --> 01:05:23.940]   And also, Google Voice, you get text messaging, obviously,
[01:05:23.940 --> 01:05:25.460]   free text messaging.
[01:05:25.460 --> 01:05:28.820]   Well, you know, and this is nice because it does see your--
[01:05:28.820 --> 01:05:33.340]   it goes through your contact list and shows up in the Skype.
[01:05:33.340 --> 01:05:38.420]   I'm just going to get that image of this here if I can.
[01:05:38.420 --> 01:05:40.700]   It goes-- where is that?
[01:05:40.700 --> 01:05:41.980]   Where is that?
[01:05:41.980 --> 01:05:42.980]   I know it's here somewhere.
[01:05:42.980 --> 01:05:44.380]   There it is.
[01:05:44.380 --> 01:05:45.780]   I've got to find the camera.
[01:05:45.780 --> 01:05:48.500]   So this is Skype.
[01:05:48.500 --> 01:05:52.700]   You see, these are my Skype client contacts.
[01:05:52.700 --> 01:05:56.740]   But this is all my phone contacts for my phone book.
[01:05:56.740 --> 01:05:59.340]   You can do events.
[01:05:59.340 --> 01:06:01.980]   And it runs, by the way, all the time in the background.
[01:06:01.980 --> 01:06:05.580]   So it's always on.
[01:06:05.580 --> 01:06:07.820]   Eh, eh, there it is.
[01:06:07.820 --> 01:06:10.100]   Eh, have it.
[01:06:10.100 --> 01:06:11.740]   But Fring is still around.
[01:06:11.740 --> 01:06:15.540]   This was the wonky choice for people who didn't have Skype.
[01:06:15.540 --> 01:06:19.540]   And as Fring is now doing one penny calls,
[01:06:19.540 --> 01:06:24.900]   so they're trying to stay relevant in the Android space.
[01:06:24.900 --> 01:06:28.460]   I presume that's a penny a minute.
[01:06:28.460 --> 01:06:28.980]   Yeah.
[01:06:28.980 --> 01:06:31.220]   Except that you don't want to set up your payment information.
[01:06:31.220 --> 01:06:32.740]   It's cheap enough, but it's like, oh, I
[01:06:32.740 --> 01:06:35.820]   have to just set up my whole credit card to pay Fring.
[01:06:35.820 --> 01:06:36.380]   Yeah.
[01:06:36.380 --> 01:06:40.460]   Most of us have either credits with Skype or with Google.
[01:06:40.460 --> 01:06:41.540]   I have credits with both.
[01:06:41.540 --> 01:06:48.300]   Let's talk about market share.
[01:06:48.300 --> 01:06:49.660]   Chrome's market share.
[01:06:49.660 --> 01:06:49.820]   Triple--
[01:06:49.820 --> 01:06:50.740]   Double the week.
[01:06:50.740 --> 01:06:52.300]   OK, I won't say anything.
[01:06:52.300 --> 01:06:53.980]   How many numbers do you have?
[01:06:53.980 --> 01:06:55.340]   That's the only one.
[01:06:55.340 --> 01:06:58.540]   Well, no, he was-- OK, MG was talking about phone penetration.
[01:06:58.540 --> 01:06:59.020]   Oh, yeah.
[01:06:59.020 --> 01:07:00.220]   I thought you were talking about that.
[01:07:00.220 --> 01:07:00.740]   That's true.
[01:07:00.740 --> 01:07:02.420]   Well, I was talking about sales last month.
[01:07:02.420 --> 01:07:03.620]   The number is like that.
[01:07:03.620 --> 01:07:04.620]   But I think one of the sales--
[01:07:04.620 --> 01:07:05.260]   It's just passed on.
[01:07:05.260 --> 01:07:06.260]   We're going to have to do it now.
[01:07:06.260 --> 01:07:08.220]   Let's do phone penetration then.
[01:07:08.220 --> 01:07:12.220]   What are the numbers on the phone penetration, MG?
[01:07:12.220 --> 01:07:12.740]   Let's see.
[01:07:12.740 --> 01:07:13.740]   They're huge.
[01:07:13.740 --> 01:07:14.420]   The newest ones.
[01:07:14.420 --> 01:07:15.140]   Yeah.
[01:07:15.140 --> 01:07:18.580]   Now, this is only on stuff sold in the last quarter.
[01:07:18.580 --> 01:07:21.780]   If you take total sales, Apple will still be able to say, oh, no,
[01:07:21.780 --> 01:07:22.380]   we have pride of--
[01:07:22.380 --> 01:07:22.880]   Right.
[01:07:22.880 --> 01:07:23.380]   --totally.
[01:07:23.380 --> 01:07:23.380]   Here it is.
[01:07:23.380 --> 01:07:29.180]   32% of sales were for Google, 25% for Apple, 25% for rent.
[01:07:29.180 --> 01:07:29.660]   Right.
[01:07:29.660 --> 01:07:30.460]   That's 82%.
[01:07:30.460 --> 01:07:32.940]   I wonder who those other 18% are.
[01:07:32.940 --> 01:07:34.460]   Windows, Nokia.
[01:07:34.460 --> 01:07:35.460]   Nokia.
[01:07:35.460 --> 01:07:36.460]   Who doesn't know--
[01:07:36.460 --> 01:07:37.580]   That's in the US, right?
[01:07:37.580 --> 01:07:40.740]   That's not worldwide, because it's very different worldwide.
[01:07:40.740 --> 01:07:44.680]   So is that the first time that Android sales have topped
[01:07:44.680 --> 01:07:46.180]   RIM and Apple in a quarter?
[01:07:46.180 --> 01:07:46.740]   For a full quarter.
[01:07:46.740 --> 01:07:48.460]   I think the key here is RIM.
[01:07:48.460 --> 01:07:50.420]   RIM was the one that was still ahead.
[01:07:50.420 --> 01:07:52.300]   I think it was the last quarter that they officially
[01:07:52.300 --> 01:07:55.020]   passed Apple by various estimates or whatever.
[01:07:55.020 --> 01:07:57.660]   But yeah, RIM is the big one now.
[01:07:57.660 --> 01:07:58.660]   That's huge.
[01:07:58.660 --> 01:07:59.160]   Yeah.
[01:07:59.160 --> 01:08:00.860]   They've got a big milestone for Android.
[01:08:00.860 --> 01:08:01.360]   Yeah.
[01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:03.460]   In January, they had only 14%.
[01:08:03.460 --> 01:08:07.060]   And now, Blackberry had 34 iPhone 32.
[01:08:07.060 --> 01:08:13.740]   And so now you've got Android up to, what did I say, 35%, 35%.
[01:08:13.740 --> 01:08:15.140]   35%.
[01:08:15.140 --> 01:08:19.940]   There's a great story in Newsweek about Android.
[01:08:19.940 --> 01:08:21.820]   What's his-- I know, Dan Linett at News wake.
[01:08:21.820 --> 01:08:24.260]   But Andy Rubin has some really good quotes just
[01:08:24.260 --> 01:08:26.700]   about the messiness of Android and the fragmentation
[01:08:26.700 --> 01:08:30.080]   and the multiple hand-sads versus the iPhone kind
[01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:30.920]   of controlled experience.
[01:08:30.920 --> 01:08:34.080]   Andy Rubin, who was the guy behind Android.
[01:08:34.080 --> 01:08:34.740]   Right.
[01:08:34.740 --> 01:08:36.920]   And the guy behind site danger, right?
[01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:37.640]   He started danger.
[01:08:37.640 --> 01:08:39.080]   And then Android.
[01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:41.280]   So yeah, that's a big milestone for Android.
[01:08:41.280 --> 01:08:43.360]   So he's saying he doesn't like the fragmentation
[01:08:43.360 --> 01:08:44.560]   that that's a problem?
[01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:47.600]   No, he's saying that Android's evolution is messy.
[01:08:47.600 --> 01:08:48.100]   Right?
[01:08:48.100 --> 01:08:49.280]   And the fragmentation is part of it.
[01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:50.520]   It's called open source.
[01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:50.840]   Right.
[01:08:50.840 --> 01:08:51.840]   It's open source.
[01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:53.280]   And so there's lots of different developers
[01:08:53.280 --> 01:08:55.360]   and lots of different manufacturers all contributing to it.
[01:08:55.360 --> 01:08:57.660]   And that's just sort of the evolution is a little messier.
[01:08:57.660 --> 01:08:58.940]   But that's what it is right now.
[01:08:58.940 --> 01:09:01.740]   Would you say the evolution of Windows was equally messy?
[01:09:01.740 --> 01:09:02.740]   No.
[01:09:02.740 --> 01:09:04.380]   No, well, Windows was an open source.
[01:09:04.380 --> 01:09:05.100]   Yeah, true.
[01:09:05.100 --> 01:09:05.940]   But it was--
[01:09:05.940 --> 01:09:06.940]   You know what it is?
[01:09:06.940 --> 01:09:09.580]   It's the new iterative model.
[01:09:09.580 --> 01:09:10.080]   Yes.
[01:09:10.080 --> 01:09:12.980]   And that's what's changed entirely in the entire software
[01:09:12.980 --> 01:09:13.300]   industry.
[01:09:13.300 --> 01:09:15.140]   That's that thing you were talking about with Facebook.
[01:09:15.140 --> 01:09:16.180]   We don't know what it is.
[01:09:16.180 --> 01:09:18.460]   Well, we'll get-- no one we get there.
[01:09:18.460 --> 01:09:19.980]   And Android's kind of the same thing.
[01:09:19.980 --> 01:09:21.180]   It's iterating.
[01:09:21.180 --> 01:09:22.780]   Whereas Windows-- Windows was never--
[01:09:22.780 --> 01:09:25.400]   It was the pre-iterative stage of software development
[01:09:25.400 --> 01:09:27.000]   where you created something that was--
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:28.280]   you released full-blown.
[01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:29.760]   This is done.
[01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:30.160]   Yeah.
[01:09:30.160 --> 01:09:32.640]   And if you iterate its inversions--
[01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:35.840]   Google defines a list of capabilities
[01:09:35.840 --> 01:09:37.960]   that a phone has to have in order
[01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:40.280]   to carry the Google brand-- or the Google brand.
[01:09:40.280 --> 01:09:41.560]   I'm not sure about the Android brand.
[01:09:41.560 --> 01:09:43.640]   So that's their way of sort of communicating
[01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:44.480]   to manufacturers.
[01:09:44.480 --> 01:09:46.680]   Like, the phone needs to do these things
[01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:48.480]   to have these compatibilities in order for you
[01:09:48.480 --> 01:09:50.160]   to have our name on them.
[01:09:50.160 --> 01:09:52.080]   I think they could-- maybe-- I don't know.
[01:09:52.080 --> 01:09:55.140]   Maybe they could do a little bit better in that respect.
[01:09:55.140 --> 01:09:57.980]   They could maybe use their way in terms of like here--
[01:09:57.980 --> 01:10:01.520]   using our label to make some phones be maybe a little more
[01:10:01.520 --> 01:10:04.920]   consistent if the fragmentation gets worse.
[01:10:04.920 --> 01:10:06.440]   But that was interesting to me.
[01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:08.880]   I didn't realize that that was the case.
[01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:10.320]   Well, it's certainly a challenge, right?
[01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:13.000]   I mean, if you're trying to appeal to consumers,
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.160]   it's the same challenge Google TV will face.
[01:10:15.160 --> 01:10:17.760]   Complexity is always bad for sales.
[01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:19.400]   On the other hand, we like choice.
[01:10:19.400 --> 01:10:24.440]   So it's kind of-- choice kind of means complexity.
[01:10:24.440 --> 01:10:25.520]   Apple's got it simple.
[01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:26.680]   It's very straightforward.
[01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:29.360]   One skew.
[01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:31.720]   But you don't have much choice.
[01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:35.520]   Google's responding to Oracle's lawsuit, Oracle suing
[01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:39.440]   Google over the use of Java for the Android phones.
[01:10:39.440 --> 01:10:42.080]   I think Engadget's summary says it all.
[01:10:42.080 --> 01:10:46.040]   Quote, Google says Android didn't infringe on any of Oracle's
[01:10:46.040 --> 01:10:46.480]   patents.
[01:10:46.480 --> 01:10:49.200]   And even if it does, those patents are invalid.
[01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:52.840]   And/or unenforceable for a variety of reasons anyway,
[01:10:52.840 --> 01:10:54.400]   so shove it.
[01:10:54.400 --> 01:11:00.520]   Yeah, this whole thing is getting really messy.
[01:11:00.520 --> 01:11:02.000]   Everyone is basically suing everyone.
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:03.200]   Someone had a good chart yesterday.
[01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:04.440]   I forget where it was exactly.
[01:11:04.440 --> 01:11:07.280]   But it's like connecting all the arrows from Motorola
[01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:10.280]   to Google to Apple out in everyone suing one another.
[01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:13.400]   I think Motorola today is suing Apple on 50 different counts
[01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:15.200]   for patent infringement.
[01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:17.320]   Microsoft is suing Motorola.
[01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:18.840]   It's just a nightmare.
[01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:22.520]   I mean, this is what they're all trying to get into now.
[01:11:22.520 --> 01:11:26.480]   There was a little news talk that Microsoft might be kind of
[01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:29.560]   not directly going after Android, but going after partners
[01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:32.520]   who aren't building Windows Phone 7 phones and suing them
[01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:34.040]   if they're using Android.
[01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:36.080]   Because they're saying, well, yeah, Android may be free,
[01:11:36.080 --> 01:11:38.520]   but you have to pay us basically a patent fee
[01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:39.800]   to use any of these features.
[01:11:39.800 --> 01:11:43.040]   So maybe you should come with us and not think about Android.
[01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:44.960]   The whole thing is a nightmare right now.
[01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:46.960]   Here's something your Germans will like.
[01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:51.760]   This is from Gizmodo, a murder captured by the Google.
[01:11:51.760 --> 01:11:54.080]   Can this be possible by the Google preview car?
[01:11:54.080 --> 01:11:55.000]   The dead bodies were.
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:56.880]   The dead bodies were just there.
[01:11:56.880 --> 01:11:59.280]   Yeah, they got rid of them pretty quick, I think.
[01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:00.200]   But they were up there.
[01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:02.600]   This is in Rio.
[01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:04.440]   Yeah, isn't that horrible?
[01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:08.280]   Good, it's hard.
[01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:09.400]   Maybe it's not a murder.
[01:12:09.400 --> 01:12:13.920]   They say maybe this one in Rio is probably hitting run.
[01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:17.000]   I don't understand how the Google car got so close
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:18.800]   to a body laying out in the street like that.
[01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:20.720]   I mean, you would think that it would be surrounded
[01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:22.000]   by police cars.
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.880]   Yeah, it must have just happened.
[01:12:24.880 --> 01:12:26.160]   Yeah, but the body's covered.
[01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:27.400]   Oh, no, it's covered in plastic.
[01:12:27.400 --> 01:12:28.040]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:12:28.040 --> 01:12:34.040]   Well, they have a different standard in some of these countries.
[01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:36.640]   There was another great story that is up on the--
[01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:38.800]   I don't know if it's up on the front feed,
[01:12:38.800 --> 01:12:41.040]   but it's up on the rundown, which
[01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:44.600]   is a view of the value of Street View and other ways
[01:12:44.600 --> 01:12:49.960]   that you imagine that Street View content were used for games.
[01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:54.640]   And so now you go from Grand Theft Auto--
[01:12:54.640 --> 01:12:55.120]   Sure.
[01:12:55.120 --> 01:12:57.480]   --made up world to the real world.
[01:12:57.480 --> 01:12:58.800]   You go through the real Times Square.
[01:12:58.800 --> 01:12:59.800]   Right.
[01:12:59.800 --> 01:13:03.760]   It's like that video that was on YouTube, the HTML5 demo video
[01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:04.600]   where they took a song.
[01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:05.960]   You would enter it where you lived.
[01:13:05.960 --> 01:13:06.840]   And then which shows--
[01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:08.760]   --the street views of where you lived.
[01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:12.920]   So you go through this real world view.
[01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:16.000]   And it also speculated that there'll
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:19.000]   be software to cut out people, which Street View is looking
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:20.640]   to do anyway because of the Germans.
[01:13:20.640 --> 01:13:26.160]   And so it becomes more of a sanitized but real world.
[01:13:26.160 --> 01:13:28.480]   My joke is the Germans, when they have the pixelated buildings,
[01:13:28.480 --> 01:13:30.360]   if you go through that, you'll go to Narnia.
[01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:32.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:37.920]   Speaking of creepy, Eric Schmidt says, quote,
[01:13:37.920 --> 01:13:41.240]   "Google's policy is to get right up to the creepy line
[01:13:41.240 --> 01:13:43.200]   and not cross it."
[01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:44.760]   Eric, Eric, Eric.
[01:13:44.760 --> 01:13:50.040]   Will somebody please pull a plug on Eric Schmidt?
[01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:53.800]   He's being interviewed and asked about a Google implant.
[01:13:53.800 --> 01:13:55.280]   And that's when Eric says, well, I
[01:13:55.280 --> 01:13:58.640]   think implants would cross the creepy line.
[01:13:58.640 --> 01:14:00.400]   Wow.
[01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:02.240]   Why does he keep saying this stuff?
[01:14:02.240 --> 01:14:04.680]   I mean, it's just like a stop.
[01:14:04.680 --> 01:14:06.480]   You know, it just makes me want to interview him.
[01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:07.320]   That's all.
[01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:08.320]   Yeah.
[01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:09.600]   I'm supposed to see him.
[01:14:09.600 --> 01:14:10.720]   Who this could probably get messed up.
[01:14:10.720 --> 01:14:12.520]   I'm supposed to see him Friday from my book.
[01:14:12.520 --> 01:14:13.720]   I hope you get to talk to him.
[01:14:13.720 --> 01:14:17.400]   This is an interview with Atlantic editor James Bennett
[01:14:17.400 --> 01:14:19.520]   at the Washington Ideas Forum.
[01:14:19.520 --> 01:14:21.920]   Schmidt actually says some, I think, very right on things
[01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:25.280]   about Washington DC.
[01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:29.160]   He says no technology can completely change the way
[01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:29.800]   government works.
[01:14:29.800 --> 01:14:34.480]   Government Washington is an incumbent protection machine.
[01:14:34.480 --> 01:14:37.040]   And he says, technology is fundamentally disruptive.
[01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:38.720]   Mobile phones and personal technology
[01:14:38.720 --> 01:14:41.480]   could be used to record the bills that members of Congress
[01:14:41.480 --> 01:14:43.280]   actually read.
[01:14:43.280 --> 01:14:46.080]   Yeah, that'll happen.
[01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:46.560]   Oh, cool.
[01:14:46.560 --> 01:14:46.920]   Sure.
[01:14:46.920 --> 01:14:49.720]   Just put that thing on me and then determine
[01:14:49.720 --> 01:14:52.000]   what stimulus funds were successfully spent.
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:52.360]   It's true.
[01:14:52.360 --> 01:14:55.120]   Information is a chance to reinvent government.
[01:14:55.120 --> 01:14:56.120]   But--
[01:14:56.120 --> 01:14:57.800]   That's a gov-- that's a gov-to-oh, pay-up there.
[01:14:57.800 --> 01:14:59.320]   That's too-oh, yeah.
[01:14:59.320 --> 01:14:59.800]   But as--
[01:14:59.800 --> 01:15:01.160]   Well, he's also saying-- when I
[01:15:01.160 --> 01:15:04.760]   when I asked him about this at Aspen Institute,
[01:15:04.760 --> 01:15:08.840]   a year-- some were ago, and about this kind of disruption.
[01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:10.400]   And he said, look at the bailouts.
[01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:11.640]   It all went to the old industries.
[01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:13.120]   Nothing went to developing the future.
[01:15:13.120 --> 01:15:15.120]   Right.
[01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:17.040]   America's research universities says
[01:15:17.040 --> 01:15:19.400]   Eric Schmidt are the envy of the world.
[01:15:19.400 --> 01:15:22.160]   We have 90% of the top researchers in the world.
[01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:24.640]   We also have a bizarre policy of training people
[01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:27.040]   and kicking them out by not giving them visas.
[01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:30.800]   Something Silicon Valley has always been bringing the bell
[01:15:30.800 --> 01:15:33.000]   on those H-1V visas.
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:39.720]   China, he says, China governs like a large industrial company.
[01:15:39.720 --> 01:15:41.640]   It wants to maximize its cash flow,
[01:15:41.640 --> 01:15:45.120]   wants to maximize its internal and external demand.
[01:15:45.120 --> 01:15:47.800]   All of the interesting new ideas,
[01:15:47.800 --> 01:15:49.440]   like doubling down on solar tech,
[01:15:49.440 --> 01:15:54.400]   can be understood as a business expansion.
[01:15:54.400 --> 01:15:54.760]   It's OK.
[01:15:54.760 --> 01:15:55.680]   It sounds like a good interview.
[01:15:55.680 --> 01:15:57.240]   I hope you do get to talk to him.
[01:15:57.240 --> 01:15:57.720]   Yeah.
[01:15:57.720 --> 01:15:59.080]   He's an amazing, rare form.
[01:15:59.080 --> 01:16:00.400]   He's an amazing, amazing, smart guy.
[01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:02.240]   He's-- he's always challenging.
[01:16:02.240 --> 01:16:06.240]   And he's willing to talk, which a lot of people
[01:16:06.240 --> 01:16:08.680]   are not willing to do.
[01:16:08.680 --> 01:16:13.520]   All right, we're going to wrap this puppy up.
[01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:15.160]   First, let me-- we'll get our tool tip
[01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:16.960]   in a number of the week in just a bit.
[01:16:16.960 --> 01:16:19.080]   MGC, let me let you go, because you probably
[01:16:19.080 --> 01:16:20.240]   have other things to do.
[01:16:20.240 --> 01:16:21.960]   I want to thank you for being here.
[01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:22.960]   It's great to come.
[01:16:22.960 --> 01:16:23.400]   Thanks, John.
[01:16:23.400 --> 01:16:24.240]   Just love MGC.
[01:16:24.240 --> 01:16:24.760]   Thanks, MGC.
[01:16:24.760 --> 01:16:25.960]   Rights for TechCrunch.
[01:16:25.960 --> 01:16:27.560]   TechCrunch.com.
[01:16:27.560 --> 01:16:31.000]   He's Paris Lemon on all the social networks.
[01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:34.560]   And we really got to come back soon, OK?
[01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:35.400]   Yeah, any time.
[01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:35.840]   Thanks, much.
[01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:37.480]   I really appreciate it.
[01:16:37.480 --> 01:16:42.080]   And now it's time for Gina's tip of the week.
[01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:44.920]   This is a really simple Google Instant tip.
[01:16:44.920 --> 01:16:46.920]   Last week, I think right after the show,
[01:16:46.920 --> 01:16:48.960]   Google announced that they added a few more keyboard shortcuts
[01:16:48.960 --> 01:16:50.240]   to Google Instant.
[01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:52.920]   You can navigate up and down, not only up and down
[01:16:52.920 --> 01:16:55.160]   the drop down of suggestions, but up and down
[01:16:55.160 --> 01:16:57.280]   the results when you get them.
[01:16:57.280 --> 01:16:59.800]   And then you can hit Enter to go to them.
[01:16:59.800 --> 01:17:01.880]   So you can basically search Google now
[01:17:01.880 --> 01:17:03.960]   and then go to the result that you want without ever
[01:17:03.960 --> 01:17:05.320]   touching them out, which is pretty cool.
[01:17:05.320 --> 01:17:07.320]   So it's just after you do a search--
[01:17:07.320 --> 01:17:09.800]   something I'm going to do it-- go to Google.com.
[01:17:09.800 --> 01:17:15.640]   As you do a search, you select the Google Instant suggestion
[01:17:15.640 --> 01:17:17.880]   that you want, hit Enter to get your results.
[01:17:17.880 --> 01:17:20.400]   And you'll see a little blue arrow on the left-hand side
[01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:21.480]   of the search results.
[01:17:21.480 --> 01:17:24.640]   And you can use your up and down arrow keys to move it.
[01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:26.040]   And then when it's on the length that you want,
[01:17:26.040 --> 01:17:28.320]   you hit Enter and it zips you right there.
[01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:29.880]   Oh, that's what it is.
[01:17:29.880 --> 01:17:31.440]   I couldn't figure out where it was.
[01:17:31.440 --> 01:17:32.440]   Yeah.
[01:17:32.440 --> 01:17:33.440]   What is that?
[01:17:33.440 --> 01:17:33.720]   What is that?
[01:17:33.720 --> 01:17:35.120]   What's that doing?
[01:17:35.120 --> 01:17:36.840]   What's that all about?
[01:17:36.840 --> 01:17:38.360]   Cool.
[01:17:38.360 --> 01:17:39.560]   Any other keys?
[01:17:39.560 --> 01:17:42.240]   Where do they document this stuff?
[01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:46.600]   There's-- it's buried in some help.py file somewhere.
[01:17:46.600 --> 01:17:47.600]   You know.
[01:17:47.600 --> 01:17:48.600]   Help.py.
[01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:49.200]   I love it.
[01:17:49.200 --> 01:17:49.720]   Yeah.
[01:17:49.720 --> 01:17:50.760]   It's always like some--
[01:17:50.760 --> 01:17:51.080]   It's like some--
[01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:51.080]   It's like some--
[01:17:51.080 --> 01:17:52.080]   It's like some--
[01:17:52.080 --> 01:17:53.080]   --py.py.
[01:17:53.080 --> 01:17:53.580]   --py.
[01:17:53.580 --> 01:17:54.080]   Yeah.
[01:17:54.080 --> 01:17:55.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:17:55.800 --> 01:17:57.360]   But they did an announcement about it.
[01:17:57.360 --> 01:17:59.160]   It's a pretty small addition.
[01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:00.440]   But it's really nice.
[01:18:00.440 --> 01:18:01.480]   It's nice for people.
[01:18:01.480 --> 01:18:01.960]   If you follow--
[01:18:01.960 --> 01:18:03.960]   And they're also showing previews of the pages too.
[01:18:03.960 --> 01:18:04.440]   So right?
[01:18:04.440 --> 01:18:04.880]   That's kind of--
[01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:05.400]   Yeah.
[01:18:05.400 --> 01:18:07.040]   Some people, they are showing previews.
[01:18:07.040 --> 01:18:11.240]   And I think instant within the Chrome bar is also--
[01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:13.680]   there's some rumblings about it when
[01:18:13.680 --> 01:18:15.440]   the early dev versions are showing up.
[01:18:15.440 --> 01:18:15.920]   So I mean--
[01:18:15.920 --> 01:18:16.920]   And while you're on the top of it--
[01:18:16.920 --> 01:18:17.920]   --because it's the thing, it's annoying.
[01:18:17.920 --> 01:18:19.720]   You stuff the-- you know, navigate to google.com
[01:18:19.720 --> 01:18:21.520]   to do your search, which none of us do.
[01:18:21.520 --> 01:18:22.640]   None of us do.
[01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:23.440]   Right.
[01:18:23.440 --> 01:18:24.280]   Right.
[01:18:24.280 --> 01:18:26.320]   One of the little tidbit that I just
[01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:29.560]   put on the list right before the show was that one analyst is
[01:18:29.560 --> 01:18:31.960]   saying that Google Instant is already improving Google
[01:18:31.960 --> 01:18:32.880]   advertising results.
[01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:33.400]   And I haven't--
[01:18:33.400 --> 01:18:35.640]   Oh, how would they know that, I wonder?
[01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:36.440]   That's what I wanted to.
[01:18:36.440 --> 01:18:38.800]   They up their revenue projections because of it.
[01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:40.360]   Well, if you type slowly enough, I
[01:18:40.360 --> 01:18:43.560]   guess you see a lot more advertisements, you know?
[01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:44.080]   Yeah.
[01:18:44.080 --> 01:18:50.200]   So I typed Leo, and now I'm seeing the horoscope ads for AOL.
[01:18:50.200 --> 01:18:51.440]   And then I'm going to type--
[01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:53.200]   yeah, I guess you'd see more ads.
[01:18:56.200 --> 01:18:57.680]   Your number of the week, Mr. J.
[01:18:57.680 --> 01:18:59.560]   Oh, I'm getting another one out since I stole the first one.
[01:18:59.560 --> 01:19:00.600]   No, we didn't say it.
[01:19:00.600 --> 01:19:01.080]   Go ahead.
[01:19:01.080 --> 01:19:01.800]   We just started it.
[01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:02.800]   No, that was the 36%.
[01:19:02.800 --> 01:19:03.160]   That was it.
[01:19:03.160 --> 01:19:03.520]   That's all right.
[01:19:03.520 --> 01:19:04.440]   I got another one.
[01:19:04.440 --> 01:19:06.080]   So there was a-- there was-- some people
[01:19:06.080 --> 01:19:10.240]   see as a real puff piece on Mark Zuckerberg's CEO,
[01:19:10.240 --> 01:19:13.840]   or I mean, a COO, Cheryl Sandberg, in The New York Times
[01:19:13.840 --> 01:19:14.320]   this weekend.
[01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:16.360]   I thought it was actually a very interesting story.
[01:19:16.360 --> 01:19:19.640]   But it's set in there that there are 200 ex-googlers
[01:19:19.640 --> 01:19:21.480]   working at Facebook.
[01:19:21.480 --> 01:19:22.520]   Wow.
[01:19:22.520 --> 01:19:23.440]   Which is pretty amazing.
[01:19:23.440 --> 01:19:23.960]   That's a lot.
[01:19:23.960 --> 01:19:24.440]   That's a lot.
[01:19:24.440 --> 01:19:27.040]   6,800 employees, that's a very high percentage.
[01:19:27.040 --> 01:19:27.680]   Wow.
[01:19:27.680 --> 01:19:30.160]   There's 1,600 employees and 200 of them--
[01:19:30.160 --> 01:19:30.800]   one in 80--
[01:19:30.800 --> 01:19:31.400]   That's what they said.
[01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:32.600]   --are googlers.
[01:19:32.600 --> 01:19:34.920]   Valley transfer, don't be evil.
[01:19:34.920 --> 01:19:35.920]   Yeah.
[01:19:35.920 --> 01:19:36.920]   Oh.
[01:19:36.920 --> 01:19:39.720]   Well, but that's-- I think a lot of the great people,
[01:19:39.720 --> 01:19:44.680]   like Paul Buhai and Brett Taylor, and I was Dave
[01:19:44.680 --> 01:19:46.400]   recording a googler, I think he was.
[01:19:46.400 --> 01:19:47.440]   He was at six apart.
[01:19:47.440 --> 01:19:48.680]   Six apart, that's right.
[01:19:48.680 --> 01:19:49.560]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:19:49.560 --> 01:19:51.320]   But if-- hey, if this means that they're
[01:19:51.320 --> 01:19:54.040]   going to help Facebook sort of embrace the open web more,
[01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:54.540]   great.
[01:19:54.540 --> 01:19:55.040]   Keep going.
[01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:56.040]   Keep going.
[01:19:56.040 --> 01:19:57.360]   It's the culture.
[01:19:57.360 --> 01:19:59.840]   It's not-- Google creates a culture for the internet,
[01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:01.120]   and the culture expands.
[01:20:01.120 --> 01:20:02.280]   It's not a bad thing.
[01:20:02.280 --> 01:20:03.400]   So that's my number.
[01:20:03.400 --> 01:20:05.800]   Good number.
[01:20:05.800 --> 01:20:08.120]   My tool of the week is-- something actually
[01:20:08.120 --> 01:20:11.080]   Matt Cutts announced-- it's been around for a little while.
[01:20:11.080 --> 01:20:14.400]   It's the Google URL shortener is now open to the public.
[01:20:14.400 --> 01:20:15.880]   You can use this for yourself.
[01:20:15.880 --> 01:20:19.800]   It's g-double-o-dot-g-l.
[01:20:19.800 --> 01:20:21.960]   Yeah, it's shorter.
[01:20:21.960 --> 01:20:23.040]   It will have stats.
[01:20:23.040 --> 01:20:25.640]   It's very bitly like, really, in some of its features.
[01:20:25.640 --> 01:20:28.120]   But it's not as complete in the feature set.
[01:20:28.120 --> 01:20:29.720]   But it will have stats.
[01:20:29.720 --> 01:20:32.560]   You can see I haven't used it, but will show you
[01:20:32.560 --> 01:20:34.960]   when it was created how many clicks it received.
[01:20:34.960 --> 01:20:37.400]   And you can see clicks for two hours, the day, the week,
[01:20:37.400 --> 01:20:39.520]   the month, and all time.
[01:20:39.520 --> 01:20:41.520]   And you're not beholden to Libya.
[01:20:41.520 --> 01:20:43.360]   Do you see what just happened?
[01:20:43.360 --> 01:20:46.680]   b-i-t-dot-l-y is registered through the Libyan.
[01:20:46.680 --> 01:20:49.280]   And so two sex-related URL shorteners just
[01:20:49.280 --> 01:20:52.840]   got shut off under Shari'a law.
[01:20:52.840 --> 01:20:53.680]   Oh, really?
[01:20:53.680 --> 01:20:55.840]   Yeah, vb.ly, right?
[01:20:55.840 --> 01:20:56.340]   Oh.
[01:20:56.340 --> 01:20:57.040]   Yeah.
[01:20:57.040 --> 01:20:59.720]   Violet Blue's service, and was there another one?
[01:20:59.720 --> 01:21:02.600]   The Google shortener, too, will give you a QR code.
[01:21:02.600 --> 01:21:03.360]   Yangiks.
[01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:05.880]   Yeah, automatically, which I really, really like.
[01:21:05.880 --> 01:21:08.200]   Yeah, that's actually a nice feature of it.
[01:21:08.200 --> 01:21:10.840]   So what's the dot-g-l?
[01:21:10.840 --> 01:21:11.760]   Google.
[01:21:11.760 --> 01:21:12.400]   I don't know.
[01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:13.200]   That's a good question.
[01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:15.760]   It's the land known as Google.
[01:21:15.760 --> 01:21:17.640]   I come from the land of Google.
[01:21:17.640 --> 01:21:20.800]   If anyone deserves their own domain, it ate at them.
[01:21:20.800 --> 01:21:25.480]   There's the twit.tv QR code.
[01:21:25.480 --> 01:21:27.200]   I like that.
[01:21:27.200 --> 01:21:29.200]   Yeah, I was thinking for a while.
[01:21:29.200 --> 01:21:30.920]   Many years ago, I wanted to start a service
[01:21:30.920 --> 01:21:36.080]   called your daily action item, da.ly.ly.
[01:21:36.080 --> 01:21:39.000]   And just, I like the domain name.
[01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:40.280]   And then I realized I'm going to have
[01:21:40.280 --> 01:21:43.600]   to go to Moammar Gaddafi to get it.
[01:21:43.600 --> 01:21:45.000]   G.L. is Greenland.
[01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:45.520]   Greenland.
[01:21:45.520 --> 01:21:46.680]   See, that's safe.
[01:21:46.680 --> 01:21:47.320]   That's safe.
[01:21:47.320 --> 01:21:48.320]   They're never going to say.
[01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:51.120]   A lesson melts, but don't say.
[01:21:51.120 --> 01:21:52.120]   Yeah, I always get that confused.
[01:21:52.120 --> 01:21:53.240]   Greenland is the one that's icy.
[01:21:53.240 --> 01:21:54.920]   And Iceland is the one that's green.
[01:21:54.920 --> 01:21:57.360]   It's not right.
[01:21:57.360 --> 01:21:58.160]   There we go.
[01:21:58.160 --> 01:21:58.800]   There you have it.
[01:21:58.800 --> 01:21:59.480]   There you go.
[01:21:59.480 --> 01:22:01.880]   It is this week in Google this portion of this week
[01:22:01.880 --> 01:22:02.920]   in Google brought to my bike.
[01:22:02.920 --> 01:22:03.720]   Good friend.
[01:22:03.720 --> 01:22:05.400]   I just want to give him a little plug here.
[01:22:05.400 --> 01:22:08.600]   Tom Johnson, who does mail route.
[01:22:08.600 --> 01:22:09.880]   mail route.info.
[01:22:09.880 --> 01:22:12.080]   It's the best anti-spam engine for people
[01:22:12.080 --> 01:22:13.280]   who have their own domains.
[01:22:13.280 --> 01:22:15.520]   If you use Gmail, you don't need it.
[01:22:15.520 --> 01:22:16.760]   I'm telling you right now.
[01:22:16.760 --> 01:22:18.680]   I'll just save you some time.
[01:22:18.680 --> 01:22:21.800]   But if you have your own domain as I do leoville.com,
[01:22:21.800 --> 01:22:23.360]   mail route is fantastic.
[01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:24.880]   What was the number again, Leo, one more time?
[01:22:24.880 --> 01:22:26.120]   And how much spam you got last year?
[01:22:26.120 --> 01:22:27.240]   I don't have it here somewhere.
[01:22:27.240 --> 01:22:28.080]   It's something--
[01:22:28.080 --> 01:22:28.920]   It was a million pieces.
[01:22:28.920 --> 01:22:30.520]   It was a million pieces of spam that it blocked.
[01:22:30.520 --> 01:22:33.200]   It never even went on my server.
[01:22:33.200 --> 01:22:35.720]   And we got Tom Merritt using it for his sub-billion.
[01:22:35.720 --> 01:22:37.160]   He started-- he has sub-billion.
[01:22:37.160 --> 01:22:38.000]   And he's had it for years.
[01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.680]   He never-- he created a mail server and everything.
[01:22:40.680 --> 01:22:45.200]   Never use it because there was so much spam on it.
[01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:46.560]   So we've got it going through mail route.
[01:22:46.560 --> 01:22:49.480]   And already, I think I just saw the first stats have come out
[01:22:49.480 --> 01:22:50.400]   from a sub-billion.
[01:22:50.400 --> 01:22:53.120]   It was like 98% spam.
[01:22:53.120 --> 01:22:54.240]   So you get spam protection.
[01:22:54.240 --> 01:22:56.960]   You get virus protection too because, of course,
[01:22:56.960 --> 01:22:59.160]   that's often attached to the email.
[01:22:59.160 --> 01:23:02.400]   Disaster recovery with their mail-bagging service.
[01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:04.040]   It is a really neat service.
[01:23:04.040 --> 01:23:06.320]   If you have your own domain, the simple test
[01:23:06.320 --> 01:23:07.760]   is if you can change your MX record,
[01:23:07.760 --> 01:23:10.280]   or you know someone who can, you can use mail route.
[01:23:10.280 --> 01:23:12.040]   And I think you will like it.
[01:23:12.040 --> 01:23:15.120]   $2 per seat with a minimum of 20 a month.
[01:23:15.120 --> 01:23:18.920]   But if you go to mail route.info and sign up as a Twitter
[01:23:18.920 --> 01:23:22.600]   listener, you'll get 10% off for life.
[01:23:22.600 --> 01:23:24.720]   I've been using it for six years now.
[01:23:24.720 --> 01:23:28.000]   And I love it mail route.info.
[01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.040]   We thank them for their support of this week in Google.
[01:23:30.040 --> 01:23:32.120]   I thank Jeff Jarvis from being here, the author of What
[01:23:32.120 --> 01:23:33.960]   Would Google Do?
[01:23:33.960 --> 01:23:34.320]   He--
[01:23:34.320 --> 01:23:35.240]   Always a pleasure.
[01:23:35.240 --> 01:23:36.760]   I flew back just to do this.
[01:23:36.760 --> 01:23:37.360]   Flue back?
[01:23:37.360 --> 01:23:40.200]   Now he's going straight back to Germany.
[01:23:40.200 --> 01:23:42.680]   Buzzmachine.com is his great website.
[01:23:42.680 --> 01:23:45.840]   Gina Trapani is at smarterware.org.
[01:23:45.840 --> 01:23:47.200]   Thank you for being here also, Gina.
[01:23:47.200 --> 01:23:49.720]   And again, thanks to MG Seagler and Becky Warley for joining us.
[01:23:49.720 --> 01:23:52.720]   Becky's going to be here in just a minute with Tech News today.
[01:23:52.720 --> 01:23:54.840]   Our daily news, Tech News coverage,
[01:23:54.840 --> 01:24:01.200]   begins usually around 530 Eastern, 230 Pacific at live.tuit.tv.
[01:24:01.200 --> 01:24:01.760]   Becky, be here.
[01:24:01.760 --> 01:24:03.360]   I think Tom is in New York, actually.
[01:24:03.360 --> 01:24:05.200]   Be calling in from New York.
[01:24:05.200 --> 01:24:06.440]   Thank you, everybody, for joining us.
[01:24:06.440 --> 01:24:10.360]   You can watch us do our thing every Wednesday afternoon

[01:24:13.880 --> 01:24:17.400]   That would be 2000 UTC at live.tuit.tv.
[01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:19.440]   Chat with us at IRC.tuit.tv.
[01:24:19.440 --> 01:24:21.040]   And of course, you can download the show
[01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:24.320]   after the fact by going to tuit.tv/twig--
[01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:25.440]   T-W-I-G.
[01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:26.360]   I'm Leo LaPorte.
[01:24:26.360 --> 01:24:27.000]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.480]   We'll see you next week on This Week in Google.
[01:24:29.480 --> 01:24:32.480]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:24:32.480 --> 01:24:35.480]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:24:35.480 --> 01:24:38.840]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:24:38.840 --> 01:24:41.420]   (upbeat music)
