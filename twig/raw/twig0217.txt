[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   But I am joined here by my amazing co-host, Mr. Jeff Jarvis.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   Hey, Jeff.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   Hey, Gina.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   Jeff is the author of What Would Google Do and Public Parts and a
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   professional professor of journalism at City University of New York,
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   my my Alan Mater.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   We've also got with us today as a guest on our panel, Mr. Kevin Marks.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   Hey, Kevin.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   Hi there. Nice to see you all again.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   I've been away for a while.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   I was in the UK for a couple of weeks and then last weekend I was at XOXO.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   So I've been not paying a lot of attention for a few weeks.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   It's been good.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   That's okay.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   That's okay.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   We missed you, Kevin.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   Yeah, we have missed you.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   Kevin, you're currently at Salesforce, but you've been at Apple and Technorati and you've basically worked everywhere in the valley.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   So you've always got all kinds of insights into what's going on.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   How was XOXO?
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   All of the reviews I've read of XO is that it was great.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   It was very good again.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   They managed to pull it off a second year running, which is quite impressive.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   And again, it was very good focus conversations about making things about independence, but also a very great set of people in the great atmosphere where you could actually talk to them.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   I had a lovely long chat with lots of people who've made things and built them.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   You come away refreshed and inspired.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   Andy Bowers' closing thing was saying, "Okay, yeah, you've all been inspired, but I'm not going to do another one of these."
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   And they actually do make some things this year, so you're on notice, which I thought was very good.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   So I'm going to go and make some things now.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   So I'm hand waving as much.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   Write some more code.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   Yeah, that was what I heard a lot of people saying they came away feeling really inspired.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   I'm so upset that it was the second year in a row I had to miss it.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   The first year was because the baby was born and the second year was because it was her birthday weekend.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   So I'm hoping that they're not going to schedule it for that weekend of the 19th next year.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   All right, let's see.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   Let's dive into some Google News.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   It looks like Google's tightening up security across all of its searches, even the ones you're not signed into.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   So it used to be or in October 2011, they launched the feature that if you're signed into Google and you do a Google search, it's HTTPS encrypted SSL.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   But they're rolling out kind of quietly the HTTPS or SSL across all searches, even if you're not signed into Google.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   And kind of relatedly, they're also sort of tightening up security in Google Chrome.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   They're increasing the restrictions and standards they expect SSL certificates to meet for Chrome to not show that little, the dreaded red page.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   Maybe this isn't a site to be trusted.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   So Danny Sullivan over Search Engine Land was saying that this might be a response to the NSA leaks or this could be just Google doing what it does, which has kind of raised the standards for security across all of its properties, which has really set a good precedent over time.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   Does this matter?
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   Do users notice this kind of thing?
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   Does this kind of screws up some of the stats that you get about what people are searching for because those searches are encrypted?
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   That's a problem, but I had breakfast this morning with alla rusperger, the editor of the Guardian and he was doing magnificent work there.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   And my thought to him was that the NSA story is going to shift from Washington more and more and more to Silicon Valley.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   And whether it's a telephone company or a hardware company or, you know, a Cisco that is to say, or a consumer service company like Google, I think there's going to be a lot of calls for more information and accountability from these companies.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   They're going to have to try their best to protect us from our government.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   And so I'm betting if maybe this was always in the plan for Google, but I'm betting it got sped up because of the NSA.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   I think they've always been very good at offering encrypted searches.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   And Mad said as much when we heard Bruce Niron that it was listening to him that made them think about that more and they've obviously stepped up this over time.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   They've always had perfect forward sequence C for a while, which makes it very much harder to intercept their stuff.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   And they've all they've been doing a lot of work on actually tracking SSL certificates and when they change as part of crawl to make sure that people can't inject new certificates into certificate authorities, which is something that that has been attacked
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   that's happened recently. That was part of the to the recent defacement attacks were using techniques like that. So there's definitely a stepping up there.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   And my sense from the people I know who work in the security spaces, everyone's going through and being, you know, doing even more auditing and paranoid than they have done previously because of all the threats and allegations that have been going around.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   Right. I mean, honestly, when I saw the story, I was surprised when I found I didn't realize that if you weren't signed into Google, your searches weren't encrypted. I assume that all of them were encrypted.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   I mean, I'm pretty much almost always signed into Google anyway. So it didn't, it didn't, it didn't occur to me that if you weren't signed in that it is encrypted, but but now it is, I think, which is a good thing.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   So it seems like this is a combination of both a response, the NSA leaks, but also just a kind of incremental security upgrade, which I feel like Google is kind of always doing.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   So Jean, you're back to the point you raised. So because it's encrypted, then the metadata that used to pass along with the search isn't there anymore because it's not known or it's known in Google, but Google's not going to reveal it. Is that what you're saying?
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   The referrers go away.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   The refers the refers and the search requests go away.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   Well, the search request was always part of the referrer. That was how you used to get it.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   Okay. I always wanted to use something to take, right?
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   Because the previous page would then be, you know, Google com, question mark, queue equals, whatever you search for. And that's how that's.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   So that got a horse, that horse media companies, I think to an extent, you're right that they can't, but the problem is very few that I know of actually targeted anything at that end.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   Wordpress did quite a lot with it at one point. I'm not sure if they still did that. They may have moved away from that, but Wordpress would look when you did that and serve ads when it got one of those and not when it didn't.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   That was their way of distinguishing between the direct readers and the people who got their through search and they use that as a way of doing their incrementalization.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   About.com certainly used it because that was the basis of their business. I don't know what it does to that.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   And Google also used that too. There was something about not encrypting ad.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   And I don't understand what that meant because Google definitely uses search requests all over the web, obviously, for placement of appropriate ads.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   I can't believe they're going to. So I think they may still be used. Yes. So if you're, I think if you're, I mean, this is where we need to ask Danny probably, but I think that if you've, they still know that they referred you there and therefore, and they can, they've got a back channel.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   It adds that they've embedded that can respond to that. So they can do.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   So is that kind of unfair advantage for Google that they know what you searched for? Nobody else does. They can serve an ad. But if I wanted to use the refer to serve a targeted ad, now I can't.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   Well, you can still do, you know, cookie tracking and foreign cookie tracking. So you can still do the kind of.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   I can't really call them, but basically ads that follow you around the web. That still works because they if you if you're using an ad service that that knows where you've where you've been before.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   Right. That's that's that's that's that's that's that's that apart from the publisher. Right. So if the cookie follow your on the web, then you know that.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   But if the publisher does not is not part of that service, the publisher not gets less data. I mean, it's really a point.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   You know, right that publishers don't see the search terms when they're encrypted, right? So with privacy comes like invisibility to publishers who can't, you know, customize their content as well.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   Right. That that not that not provided refer information has gone up quite a bit. Actually, Danny's got a chart here and hit the search engine land post.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   Wow, up to 73 point, almost 74% is a search traffic where the refer is provided. So it does it does sort of publish it in a bad position, but it's certainly a good thing for users.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   Didn't Google pull back on on refers like two months ago or something? I think we had a story some time ago about how they were going to change and I wonder if it was anticipating this.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   I can't remember what the change was.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   I'm not recalling. Hmm. Well, I don't want to jump around the rundown, but but somewhere in here somewhere in here is the story about about more efforts to find out a little more speculative or more about Google replacing cookies.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   Yes, the Wall Street Journal reported that add companies are not are nervous. They're nervous about the getting replaced.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   So this is this is a similar issue that Google may have more information. I mean, it's going to get a little dicey in terms of of unfair advantage questions.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   I think I think we're placing the cookie with something better is a good idea. But if that plus this means that Google knows more about every search, you know, in a way I've said to publishers that what they should be asking for from Google is not money in Europe, but is more data about their users so they can they can serve them better.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   And if now that data is not for both reasons, it's not passed along.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   It's going to go rough.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   Yeah, I mean, the cookies thing is is partly this is that we have other ways of better and improved technology for storing information at the client side now.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   So a lot of people are moving away from cookies because you can actually use a channel five storage and things like that, which now that means that each site can do that and is up to a certain size.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   But it's certainly bigger and less clunky than using cookies was in the first place.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   I suspect in major speed that that has become, you know, the browser footprint of that has got big enough that that forcing everything through through the sort of narrow barrier of cookies may longer be true.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   It's still true that science can store information on your on your side about you. And as they know where you're coming from, they can they can tell information about that.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   So they can still broke your information back and forth between them. Just the question of the mechanisms that were there that just meant you had to include an ad in a certain way and it would happen may need changing.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   But there's a gigantic industry full of people who are busy working out ways to do this.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   So it's time for Jeff's dumb question. We should have a theme for that.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   Cookies were invented to hold state on the state.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   Yes.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   So is the held now through HTML5? How was it? How was it held?
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   It can. You can still hold it through cookies. You basically what you would normally do with cookies is store a session ID and then you look up the user in your database on the server side.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   Say, I recognize that session ID. That's this user. So all you would be a storing on the client side would be some, you know, a fake number.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   What can be done is you can store actual data there and then feed that straight back in. So you're not trying to store anything on the server.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   So that was another way of technique using cookies. But there were limitations to how much you can store in that.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   What's been added since a various HTML5 client side storage things that let you store something more database shaped the client side and use that directly.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   And people have started using that to do, you know, I suppose the sort of the original route of this was Google gears. If you remember that, where that would help you do offline things.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   And that's been going through a bunch of different standards iterations. There's a couple of different variants of how you can do this now.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   But broadly, you can store a reasonable size amount of data at the client side. You know, I think it's about five megs without the computer asking you, which means that you can store some documents and things like that rather than just the standard.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   So if you actually want to use it for storing keywords, that's where I'd say straightforward and should be unobtrusive and is actually less fragile than cookies, I'd say, because when that exists, it's usually in a more modern implementation.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   And there's more interop between browsers around that.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   Do I get, I mean, cookies give me at least some level of visibility into them and I can see the list of them. I can kill cookies. I can kill cookies.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   I mean, I can, you know, as a race cookies, block cookies and see cookies.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   Yes.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   Is there that kind of visibility and transparency in these other technologies?
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   Yes.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   Yeah. If you look in settings, you'll be able to, maybe in advanced settings, you can poke around and find that and say, no, this is like to do this.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   No, that's like, can't do that.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   So the other, uh, it's almost as obscure, you know, understanding how to do this is a fairly advanced skill and it's similar with this.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   Okay.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   You know, you're going to have to teach a user how to do this.
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   Last week, I think Kevin, we talked about the new, or we before last Leo was here. It was the new Chrome apps that can be, can now be resident on the desktop and can have more access to your computer.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   And Leo was worried about the security issues of that. Is there more moving under the browser now? Is this a trend?
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   Hey, no, there is to some extent. I mean, there's always a trade-off between, you know, computational power and access to the machine.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   That's so what's happened is that we've, um, we're getting different sets of tools to do this and different kinds of sandboxes.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   But, you know, with a lot of the big exploits we've had over the last few years have been through the existing sandboxes through, through using Java, through using Flash, through using, you know, other plugins and exploiting flaws in that.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   And that was widely installed plugins to take over the machine. So what we're seeing now is rather than having that boundary between the browser and the plugin is that the browser itself and the specification itself is much more defining what you're able to do and what you're not able to do.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   And that's because those are both more standardized and more open source implementations, me and much Leo Java to some extent.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   That means that we get to have, you know, eventually have better security and transparency around them.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   And also there'd be design learning from the, you know, the sandbox problems we had.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   If you think about the difference between the kind of sandboxing you get on Android or iOS and the kind of sandboxing you get on the Mac or Windows, there's, there's, you know, as we build new platforms, we get more ability to separate different bits of the computer from each other.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   It comes down to moving from effectively a sort of seed dispatch model where you're passing around, pointers into memory back and forth with the assumption that the programs will share them well to a more API like capability based model where you say, I would like to do X and you get a bit of API can call that does X.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   And, you know, some of those X is may have to involve direct access to the machine or bits of the machine in memory and they may be way to break out of those.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   But in general, there's more isolation installation there than there was in previous computer designs and there's more.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:44.000]   And given the amount of grief we've had with exploits and viruses and take a machine take over the malware over the past 20 years, at the point where these things designed is a lot more thought that's gone into them.
[00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   Certainly.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   Certainly.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   Let me ask this question then.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   Okay.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   So you, WebKit is open source, right?
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   Yes.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   And our Chrome and Firefox built on top of an open source.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   Yes.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   Chrome.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   So Chrome, Chrome forked off the, we're not.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   Right.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   The names are slightly fuzzy, but basically Chrome forked off.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   It's, there's this piece called Web Core, which was the piece that they were actually both using and then WebKit was Apple's wrapper around that and, and Chromium was Chrome's wrapper around that.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   And they forked that now.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   So there's, there's, there's less shared code and there was less shared code over time, but they're both still open source at that level.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   Sorry.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   Firefox has a completely separate code base that has had for years.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   That's open source too.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   So there's, there are, we now have a lease.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   We have three at least and, you know, there are some others as well, but three widespread independent open source implementations, which is good for this.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.000]   Right.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   So here's my question.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   So, so, so, so, something's open source.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   That's what gives us confidence that the security can be audited in terms of NSA and other bad guys.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   Is there stuff that's built on top of more conference?
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   Yes.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   Is there stuff that's built on top of that base on Chrome or on Firefox that's more proprietary, harder to audit, harder to get into then, you know, is that an area where I'm taking NSA?
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   It's easier to have exploits.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   There is, there are pieces that are built on top of this in, in all of the platforms because there are the bits that are the pro pro actually run times and the platform specific run times as opposed to the, the shared code and then there's, you know, there's, you know, you're building a platform.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   And then there's, you know, boundary layers.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   There's like, cap station layers around this.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   And there are places, you know, there are bits of the Chrome code that Google doesn't publish.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   There's, there's a far a code that isn't published.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   I think Firefox does still publish all of their code.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   And, you know, and similarly, there are bits of iOS and kind of bits of Android.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   This is the discussion about Android versus Google Play services, which I think you had a, you covered that a bit a couple of weeks ago when someone was talking about that.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   Yeah, we have discussed it. Yeah.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   But that, that's the distinction between code that Google doesn't share in code that Google makes open source and anyone can use.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   So what way you can audit is, you know, if you're looking to exploit, you look for attack services at all these places and you look at the boundaries between them and can you persuade this thing that you, that you are the other side of that boundary.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   So there's lots of, you know, the value of creating the, the API boundary is that you then know what that attack surface is.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   And the possible drawback is you can then put something else in between that pretends to be that thing and simulate it.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   Right.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   Someone on Twitter this week, Kurt Hansel said something really made me really think I thought it was really insightful.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   He asked is Chrome aiming to be Google's play services on the PC.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   So where play services is the kind of proprietary layer on top of open source Android that provides, you know, the hooks into Google services and Google cloud services.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   And of course, there's the layer of closed source Google apps like maps and Gmail and calendar and all that.
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   You know, it does is Chrome aspiring to be that on your desktop computer because, you know, like last week, we talked about standalone apps, Chrome apps that run on your desktop and that, you know, show up when you're in your desktop.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   You know, that don't live necessarily inside a browser tab.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   And I thought that was a pretty interesting comparison.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   I mean, I think that's, you know, that's always been there.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   I wrote a blog post about this called two faces of Android, probably three years ago now, which was about the this distinction between the piece that's open source and the piece that sits on top and requires a business deal.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   And when it's a web service, it's very these days, the web services tend to require some kind of this deal to let you use them.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   You may have some open variant of that.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   You may able to use it for a bit.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   But if you actually want to use it seriously, then you've got to make sure you've got an API key signed in the TOS and you're open to revocation of your times.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   And this is one of the challenges of this, you know, one of the values of doing web services in this way is that you can provide this.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   You can couple things back and forth and you have a fairly good idea who's calling you, but the drawback is you then, you know, it can be revoked for other reasons than terms of service reasons or they can change the terms of service on you and stop you getting access to them,
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   which is something we've seen have going back and forth between Google and Facebook and Twitter in various combinations and also various.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   Other apps that suddenly get their permissions revoked because they were threatening that and we saw it between Google and Apple to some extent as well previously.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   So there is there is the challenges and what what piece are you able to compile any code and run against it and what piece are you able to isolate and separate and both of those, you know, but both those double edged sword.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   If you can compile out of your code, that's great, but that also means that you can do a few things to the computer and take it over.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   If you can call services and have permission and revoke it, that means you can shut down malware quickly, but it also means you can shut down people for business reasons.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   So there's always a balance back and forth between the two.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   And it is one of the one of the one of the themes of XOXO was independence and the week and before I was in Brighton for the indie web camp UK.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   And that's a group that is trying to say, now we want to build a web that has this independence and isn't.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   Won't break if one of these large corporations decides to revoke something.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   And that's the challenge of Kenny Bill something that takes advantage of those services, but will not break completely if one of them shuts you down.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   And that's in some ways that's one of the more interesting like technical conversations that's going on at the moment is wanting to take advantage of the things that Google or Facebook or Twitter or anyone, you know, salesforce, anyone like this who has large numbers of services that they provide,
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   but not wanting to be so dependent on them that they can shut down your entire business.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   Yeah, no, that's a huge challenge.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   That's a huge challenge.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   I mean, I think about if you think about a web without Google on it, if Google just disappeared today, you know, there's so many things that would be happening.
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   Yeah, there's so many things that would not cross across the web.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   And I'm not just talking about consumer products, right?
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   Jeff particularly will be in trouble there.
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   Yes, he's always asking that basket.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   You know, this is why I find cyanogen mod or becoming a company, cyanogen ink becoming a company so interesting is I think that they're really reckoning with this, right?
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   Like they're this open source project, this mod, this kind of hacker weekend thing.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   So, you know, they're in a position where they're trying to get Google certification and they had to reckon with the, you know, really, because of Sanajama, that's the only reason why I realized that Gmail maps and calendar wall closed source apps that ran on top.
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   Andrew, I didn't realize this, but it came, but it came to the forefront when Google sent a CND to the engine mod back in the day, like 2009 and said, Hey, you can't include the zip right onto your into your installer.
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   So it'll be really interesting to see how they handle that. But yeah, it's good to say.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   Do you know what do you think Google thinks of Sanaj?
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   Well, you know, there was that one kind of public or fuffle back when they sent the CND and said, Hey, you can't distribute Gmail and maps with because they're closed source, you know, that your users have to get them separately.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   And I think that that kind of shook the community, the, the, the, the Sanajama community at the time.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   I think since then things have gotten better between them. And if I'm not mistaken, Sanajama and Inc has actually hired like a former VP of business development from Google to work with it.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   So they've got kind of someone who was on the inside at one point and they're working toward getting Google certification right now.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   So, you know, it's in their best interest to have a good working relationship with, with Google.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   And I mean, I think that I see it as a good thing for the Android ecosystem. I mean, if Google, if Google was a verse to someone forking Android and making another build of it, they wouldn't have made it open source to begin with.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   Right. I guess the same relationship that that.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.000]   Xiaomi has.
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   Right.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   You know, I guess in a sense, every.
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   Let me, let me, all right, this dumb questions continue. This is the dumb question show.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:09.000]   What Samsung does to Android? Is that a fork or is that.
[00:25:09.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   No, just a rough pile to top.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   Which, which bit of Samsung talking about, right? Because they've got several things going in parallel.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   So when they do the like the skins on top of it.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   That isn't really a fork, but it's changing some of the libraries and presentation layers. So these extra work to link.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   It's not the close source layer, if you like. There is also the Samsung OS project, which is a fork of Android that I forgot the name of.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   But they've been working on that for a while and had developed conferences for that and building phones that use that.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   So that's another project where they are building devices that don't have any with Google component on there.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   So they wouldn't have the Google, the Google Play services blob on that.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   And Amazon is clearly a fork.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   Amazon is.
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   I think I'm not sure that's a bit of an adventure.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   Or is it just a build with lots of things erased?
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   It's a piece. It doesn't have the Google Play staff clearly.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   No, right. It's not Google certified.
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   But I don't know from they just released FireOS 3 and it doesn't.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   I haven't seen anyone say.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:24.000]   What makes it a fork versus just a modification?
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   That's a good question.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   Yes.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   A fork starts off as just like a separation of code.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   And the question is at some point, it's like what constitutes a species.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   At some point you can't make merges between them anymore than it counts as a fork, I think.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   When they can no longer reproduce.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   So once you...
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   They are different.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   The thing is, a fork is just saying I'm going to make some modifications to this.
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   So at the base level on GitHub, there's a fork button.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   And you press that and it makes a copy of the thing and you put it yourself.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   And until you change anything, it's like a fork in name only.
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   And then when you change something, it's a fork.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   And then you can then send the changes back with the pull request.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   And then the other person can decide whether to take them or not.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   The way Android has worked is that they don't take pull requests from anyone.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   They just drop when you release every so often.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   And so your ability to infect anyone who's trying to keep up with Android is probably working
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   with a fork or they're on the special deal with Google where they've got advanced access
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.000]   to that and the Reese is going in.
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   But what happens is generally is that when they do...
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   When Google does a new code drop, the various people who've got variations on that theme
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   then have a sort of giant merge fest until they've got it working again.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   So what I don't know is what Amazon has...
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   What bit of Android Amazon FireOz3 is based on, whether it's on 4, 2 or 4, 3.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   I haven't seen anyone know that yet.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   I didn't realize they were calling it FireOz.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   Is that actually what they're...
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   So they're actually calling it FireOz.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   They're not saying they're not calling it Android.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   FireOz 3.0 Mojito is what they call it.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   Mojito?
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   Yes.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   Huh.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   I had no idea.
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:17.000]   Well, you know, I just updated my app, the Amazon App Store, and on Amazon it clearly says,
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   like, "These are apps for Android."
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   And it was funny because I was updating my app description and I was like,
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   "Oh, should I not mention Android?
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   Should I only refer to Kindle Fire?"
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   So I was like, "No, any Android device can get the Amazon App Store on it."
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   Right?
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   So it shouldn't be...
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   Yes.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   It's not the Kindle Store.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   Yeah.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   So that's the thing...
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   So they're saying, "No one's going to maintain that.
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   They need to make sure that they are still compatible."
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   But the question will become, you know, are you using Play Services?
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   If so, then you work there side of the fence.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   Are you using some of these other bits and pieces?
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   Some of the compatibility libraries may fail.
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   So that's...
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   It's like, you know, any development you're always linking against something is a question of,
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   "Is that piece there for you to link against?"
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   Or is there a shim that lets you pretend it's there?
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   Right.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   And I think Amazon's approach has been that they're adding bits for their own stuff,
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   but they're not adding third-party APIs, particularly, that I've noticed.
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   But I haven't actually looked at it in great detail.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   Yeah.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   I mean, yeah, it's very possible that the FireOS Mojito is an untouched version of the Android
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   open source project with a layer of Amazon stuff kind of built on top of it,
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   which you could argue is not a for because they haven't changed, right?
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   But they're not merging pulls back into...
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   They're not submitting, you know, Kindle-specific changes back to Google
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   and Google's not merging them.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   And they're now not even trying for Google certification.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   They don't want the Play Store on there, right?
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   They just want the Amazon App Store, right?
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.000]   Because it's an Amazon buying machine.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   But, you know, it is interesting that Google Play services really does kind of edge out
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   app compatibility.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   It hadn't occurred to me that if I hook into Google Play services as a developer,
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   that makes my app incompatible with the Amazon App Store.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   That's not that big a deal to me because, frankly, the revenue that I make from the Amazon App Store
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   is a fraction, a very small fraction of what I make from the Play Store.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   But, yeah, that's interesting.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   In fact, when I submitted my apps, the Amazon App Store,
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   they have a suite of automated tests that must fire up simulators or devices,
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   and it's fit back a report that said, "Okay, the Kindle Fire, this version,
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   that version, that version, that version, pass, pass, pass."
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   So they're clearly, like, running, running, you know, some sort of a test, you know,
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   for the app against each one of their devices.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   And I hadn't really thought about Play services that way.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   You know, when Google says, "Hey, developers, like,
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   hook into Play services, here are all the things that you can do,"
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   they're also saying, "Hey, your app's only going to work on Google-certified devices
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   from here on out, right, because it would be compatible for devices that aren't Google-certified."
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   So, so, sorry. Go ahead, come on.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   So, so far, the value of Play services has mostly been accessed to Google-specific stuff,
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   but one chunk of it is maps.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   So, if that's not there, you may get some other maps stuff, and they got to ship the API out.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   But yeah, the other bits are mostly store-specific stuff, or the, they've got an API
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   for trying to get you to do multiplayer games and high scores and things like that.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   Oh, and Google+ is the other piece, of course, yeah.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   So, there's a social API that's there in Google+.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   So, there's bits in there, and, you know, they're adding drive,
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   they're adding other bits and pieces where this gets more, you know,
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   you're able to take advantage of these things if you sign into Google,
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   and the, the auth stuff is, is getting more significant because that is,
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   that, you know, that's a valuable time saver.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   When you're using Android, you don't have to type stuff on the, on the, on the gadget.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   It'll just say, "You want to sign in with Google+?"
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   You say, "Yes," and you get this like smooth one-click integration thing.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   So, that's--
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   It's a huge user experience upgrade, for sure.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   Exactly.
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   So, so that piece is, is definitely something that makes a big difference to your app,
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   and it means you have to write a bunch of extra code if you want to say,
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   "Oh, and I'll let you sign in with Facebook independently," and that kind of stuff.
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   So, there's, there's a set of pieces there.
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   The other thing is that, that comes with this is a lot of the things that we think of
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   as part of the Android experience, which is, you know, Gmail and,
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   what's called called now Hangouts and Maps, and big chunks of that experience
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   and sense of whichever Android I use, this stuff is working.
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   The other, the, the, what are they called?
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   The messaging thing?
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:37.000]   The Google Cloud messaging.
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   The Google Cloud messaging.
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   So, the subtlety of that, of making it such that when you just miss another one,
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   one of your devices, they get dismissed on the other,
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   all those letting you write that stuff server-side rather than client-side polling
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   and things like that, which we take advantage of, you know, Google Web,
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   Google's Cloud services, but that means that, that's tying you close to that,
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:04.000]   and basically you need a Google account attached to it for that to work.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   So, there's, there's a sort of set of things that, that mean,
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   if you've got a Google account attached, this has to happen.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   So, that's, that's the piece that they've got there.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   Amazon doesn't seem to have offered quite as much of that,
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   but I haven't actually built my thing for Amazon yet.
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   So, did, did they offer you, you know, login type stuff for the, for the fire
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   and ability to access their pieces?
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   When you do that?
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   That's a good question.
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   I'm not sure.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   When you, when you get a Kindle, you sign in with your Amazon account.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   Right.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   So, so that, right.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   So, so, so really where Amazon really has to compete and really now cyanogen as well
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   is that layer, right?
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   Like you're signing in with your account and services associated with those accounts
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   and then, and they do have to offer hooks.
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   Of course, Google has a huge head start on this because they've just been at this
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   a lot longer than, than anybody else.
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   And, and a lot of ways that's, that's their, their advantage.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   But, yeah, no, as far as I know, I'm not sure.
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   But honestly, I wouldn't build that unless I was building a Kindle only app,
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   I wouldn't build that into my app because it would, it would limit the way that my app
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   would work on, on Google devices, which is the, just the majority.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   Well, that would be the, the challenges.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   Could you use something like Open ID Connect and have that work across both?
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   You know, Google has it, and if I'm making that, don't think Amazon or Facebook
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   have implemented that yet.
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   So, that would be a, one challenge there.
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   The other thing about Amazon is that they've got, I would counter this because, you know,
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   the reason I was off for two weeks was I was going to the UK with my son,
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   who's going to university in London, and he's doing English literature.
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   And so, we got a whole bunch of books to buy.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   And my first reaction was great.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   We'll buy them on the Kindle and that'll save you carrying books around and, you know,
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   and your notes will be digital and they'll be wonderful.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   And then I realized Amazon UK and Amazon US deliberately don't interoperate.
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   In fact, because of copyright issues, yes.
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   Because of, well, because of mechanical interpretations of corporations.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:55.000]   I can buy physical books from either country and deliver it into the other country,
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   and that's okay.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:34:58.000]   But I cannot do that with the digital books.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   What you have to do is set up an Amazon account, dedicate it to a particular country,
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   and only log into your Kindle with that Amazon account.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   And if you switch it, it deletes all your books and your notes.
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   So, my weekend project is going to be working out how to do this with two Google accounts
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   and two Amazon accounts on the same--
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   Oh, God, the two Google accounts will only occur to you.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   On Nexus 7.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   Well, no, two-- we can have two accounts on here because you can switch between them easily.
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   Actually, actually, right.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   Two Google accounts are a lot easier on the tablet than it is in the damn--
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   Don't get me started.
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   I'm not going to do the Google App as we would have made in things,
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   because I know that one from the universe.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   I'm going to just do a Gmail one.
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   Go ahead.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   Oh, but that's the-- somebody in the chat says they figured it out.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   Put notes, please.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   So basically, what I'm going to end up doing is making a new Google account
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   that I then attached to a new UK Amazon account,
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   and then both myself and my son can log into our independent tablets with that
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   so that we can buy-- buy books and--
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   Another thing you can do, Kevin, Kevin, is that on the new version of the tablet software,
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   you can have two different users on the same device.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   Yes, that's what I meant.
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   So you're going to have one UK user, so one has an accent and one does it.
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   Exactly, yeah.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   And you can do that with Chrome, and you can do that with iOS-- not iOS,
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:21.000]   you can do that with Macintosh, you just can't do it with iOS,
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   and you can't do it on most of the phones.
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   Right.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   Right. He's got a Kindle, he's got one of these, and we can work out how to do that.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   I'm sure you can do it with my Kindle devices.
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   It's going to have to pick one for that.
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   But as long as he's got access to both of them on this,
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   because the point is he's starting to mark up books this way and take notes on it.
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   That's actually a very useful feature, but it's-- the worry is that your notes
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   are then stuck in an Amazon cloud, and if he's trying to write an essay
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   and the Amazon cloud goes down, it'll just notice to disappear.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   Or if he accidentally switches to the wrong one and deletes them,
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   then bang all the time he spent highlighting the book is gone.
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   And given that this is--
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   So Amazon, meanwhile.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   It's more significant for him than it is for me.
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   Amazon, meanwhile.
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   Bezos sat down with some text journalists,
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   and the thing they're showing off, have you seen this?
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   I didn't put it in the rundown, I just put it in the chat section of the side.
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   Amazon Mayday.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   I haven't seen this.
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   So this is new, this is-- Bezos gets all excited, this is the--
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   So this is the way Bezos thinks about service, right?
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:24.000]   So if you have a problem, and of course, if you have a problem,
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   then that's a problem itself.
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   But you hit Mayday, and I think at first you get a video,
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   but then you can get connected directly to a video chat with a customer support person
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   who can take over your tablet if you give permission to do so
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   and can fix problems.
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   In other words, sounds good.
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   It has the air of a human talking paperclip to me.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   A little bit of clipping to this, because how many problems do you really have
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   with your tablet?
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:59.000]   And if Kindle is so well controlled, Bezos is talking about how this is a life-changing thing.
[00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   Good to have service, good to have direct service, I'm all for that.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   But I think that if tablets are designed where they're supposed to be designed,
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   they're supposed to be the easy devices.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   I don't have problems with my tablet.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   I promise that I can't connect it to Verizon, can you fix that?
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   I saw my friend snarking about tablet, but Bezos shipping tablets filled with
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   tiny people who want to help you.
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   I had connections with it.
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   I mean customer service on this level is one way that Amazon can differentiate
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   itself from Google.
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   So there's that.
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   But yeah, I agree.
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   I mean, hey, I would love -- you should do Kevin,
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   you should start screencasting software, you should get your son set up with his books,
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   and then you should dial up one of these helpful Amazon customer service people
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   and ask them how they can ensure that your kids notes are never going to get lost.
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   I have to tell you, I was an English major and I hauled around the old Norton
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   Anthologies on my back.
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   So if I had had an e-reader, that would have been way, way better, but I can't
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   imagine losing all my notes and highlights.
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   I have this like problem that when I go to the Amazon, it says which device you want
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   to send your book to and like this thing pops down that's like thinking like this.
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:23.000]   Yeah, this is this drop down of like every device that has been allowed.
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   Every and every and every touch, you know.
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   Kevin's 15th Android phone, it says something.
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   Yeah.
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   Yeah.
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   This is okay.
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   This is a working on the show problem.
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   They do only let you have copies of the books on five of them.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   And if one of them dies, you know, it's the same as the iOS problem.
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:46.000]   If my Android one is, and we're able to get the books on to another one,
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:50.000]   but we've used our copy now and the one on the broken one that we can't access
[00:39:50.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   anymore counts as a copy, which means if I say, if I try and look at a book with him,
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   I've used up another one and suddenly we're getting close to the edge of how many
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   copies of bear walkies actually kill it.
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   Kill it all device.
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:03.000]   Could you call it all?
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   I haven't found out how to yet.
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   This is this, as I say, this maybe one.
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   Well, just hit the made a button, Kevin.
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   Well, I have to find the Kindle five.
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   I've got an original Kindle fire somewhere to find that.
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   Hey, then maybe they're bad on that.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   But yeah, the other problem is I'm not sure which one is the old device because
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   it's just called Kevin's Android tablet.
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   43.
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   And I it's like, which one of these has which copy of which book?
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   That's why I never send a book to a device.
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   I only pull the device, pull the book from the device.
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   Pull it naturally.
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   That's probably smart.
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   That's probably smart.
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   Yes.
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   So let's zoom out a little bit to just sort of the big, big business decisions
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:44.000]   Google's been making.
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   Last, last week we talked about Calico, which is Google's new startup that's going to
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   attempt to lengthen the human lifespan, right?
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:55.000]   And I was saying right here on the show that I thought it was great that they had
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   this long term vision.
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   And if Google isn't going to make these kinds of investments into the long term
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   future, who is?
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   And I love this kind of long thinking.
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   Over at Wired, Ryan Tate, I thought, made a really good point.
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:15.000]   His piece is called Dear Google, shouldn't you worry about your own health?
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   And Tate's point is if Google can't invest the time and resources to keep
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   projects like Google Reader running, for example, what makes them think that
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   they should invest in such long term things?
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   Like, I brought this up because I knew that it was going to make Jeff--
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   Yeah, this was such a speechless, short-sighted, right in front of your nose
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   argument.
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   Look, it's a variant of this.
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   It's a variant of the argument that Bill Gates made to Google when Google wants
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   to bring connectivity to the world.
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   We'll solve water first.
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   You can only do one thing, right?
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   So this argument is don't save lives, save reader.
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:51.000]   Come on.
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   Come on.
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   What a ridiculous argument.
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   I agree, but Page himself is the one who said that Google's all about focus
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   and more wood behind fewer arrows and spring cleaning every few months,
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:06.000]   shutting down projects left and right, right in the tail.
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   And as he said, I watched his talk to Zeitgeist, which I can never get
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.000]   invited to.
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   But I'm not mad at you.
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   I'm only mad at Verizon, but we'll get to the president.
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   And so he said, yes, of course, it's insane, whatever I thought we were
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   insane, I wasn't saying to do a self-driving car.
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.000]   And for that matter, I think this.
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:35.000]   I think that Maps, at first, was a moonshop.
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:38.000]   What all Maps can do today is unbelievable.
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:39.000]   We take it for granted.
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   This is like it's going to be a Louis CK routine here now.
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:46.000]   But it's unbelievable Maps can do, and it also has incredible value to the
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   business.
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   It tells Google where we live and where we work, my own newspaper,
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   what whole paper doesn't know that, but Google does.
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   So Maps eventually becomes part of the business.
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   That kind of thinking would have, from that publication of all publications,
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:03.000]   would have shut down Bell Labs 50 years ago.
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   What transistor?
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   Who needs that?
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:07.000]   What does that have to do with phones?
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:08.000]   Phones are simple.
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   They use switches.
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   Don't do that.
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   Unix wouldn't have had Unix.
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   Why are you wasting your time on that?
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   Can't you make my phone work?
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   Right.
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:23.000]   We should thank God or Google, what will Google do, joke, that this kind of
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   research and long-term thinking, as you said last week,
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   this very long-term thinking is going on.
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:34.000]   And he's already proven that if something doesn't work, he will kill it.
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:35.000]   He will get rid of it.
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   And I'm sorry you don't have reader.
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   Cry feedly.
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:39.000]   [laughter]
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:43.000]   It wasn't that reader did what?
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   He was so heard about reader.
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   I'm grumpy about reader.
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:49.000]   I'm all out.
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:51.000]   Well, it's a fair argument.
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:52.000]   It's a fair argument.
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   There are no questions.
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   Google, you know, nothing to keep reader running, right?
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:01.000]   And it was like, we're shutting reader down because we're moving on.
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   It's the past and it's not the future.
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   And I actually completely believe that because I don't use an RSS
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:07.000]   reader myself and I believe that.
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   But you can see how you have Google shutting down and concentrating on
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:17.000]   your own, well, I shouldn't say short-term folks, but focusing their
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   products, but then making investments.
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:20.000]   Now, Calico is a separate company.
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   Isn't it?
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:23.000]   It's a separate company outside of Google.
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   So they're kind of investing in it.
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:25.000]   Yeah.
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   And then the same way that some of the power ones are.
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   They've got a bunch of investments in those kinds of things as well.
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   So they have these long-term things.
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.000]   They tend to put them independent companies.
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   I'm probably precise to say they can isolate them from this kind of speculation.
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   The rule is very simple here.
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   Google makes more money the more we use the web.
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:43.000]   Now, it's largely extend that.
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:51.000]   And the longer we live, the more money Google makes.
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   Right.
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   That's actually just an immutable argument.
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   Immortality is good for Google.
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:44:59.000]   Right?
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   It's the whole argument.
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.000]   If it's good for GM, it's good for America.
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   If it's good for Google, it's good for all of us.
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:05.000]   That's basically our argument.
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:06.000]   That's our argument.
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   It's like if they've got a self-driving car, you can surf the web while you're
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:10.000]   driving, which is good for Google.
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:13.000]   And yes, it is.
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   Google knows where you go.
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   Google knows where you go.
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:24.000]   Google can use these things for its not to jump around, but for its delivery service
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:26.000]   that they just launched today in Mountain View.
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:30.000]   Self-driving cars can have a lot of impact on Google.
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:33.000]   You know, that's just what I've disappointed in.
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   I expect this kind of dorky thinking from the Wall Street Journal or somewhere.
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:39.000]   But this is wired.
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:44.000]   You'd think they'd have a more strategic view.
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:45.000]   And science comes along.
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:47.000]   Innovation comes along.
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:49.000]   And Google's talked about this.
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:55.000]   They don't sit down and think ahead to the full business case use of something.
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:57.000]   They're willing to explore and invest in it.
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:01.000]   And again, I'm just glad they are and I'm glad we're in it right on the world.
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   So here I was.
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:06.000]   I thought we had a couple of guys who were reckoning, who were facing their mortality
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:10.000]   in a midlife crisis and out of the goodness of their hearts, they want to extend people's lives
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:12.000]   because they just like humanity.
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   But it turns out they just want us to serve the web longer.
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:15.000]   It's great.
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:17.000]   You had a pure greed to keep us alive longer.
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:18.000]   That's all.
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:21.000]   We're going to be hooked up to machines and they won't let us die.
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:23.000]   It's the opposite of the death panel.
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   Google's going to have the life panel.
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   Google's going to keep us alive whether we like it or not forever.
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:31.000]   No suicide allowed in Google land.
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:34.000]   Did you see by the way there's a new island that popped up in the latest earthquake
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:35.000]   where I'll pack a stand?
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:37.000]   I'm thinking that's Larry Page's island that you talked about.
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:38.000]   Google I.
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:44.000]   Oh, let's put all Google servers there and we can go there and Google keep us alive forever.
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:46.000]   We hooked up to things and we'll be happy.
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:47.000]   I swear I'll be happy.
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:49.000]   We don't actually even need bodies.
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:53.000]   You could just kind of put our brains in jars and we could just kind of like live on the web,
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:54.000]   you know, through Google.
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:55.000]   That's right.
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:56.000]   That's right.
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:59.000]   Aaron Levy had the best two takes on this.
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:01.000]   His first one was Larry Page.
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:03.000]   I have 1% of our customer churning every year.
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:05.000]   This is actually analyst death.
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:06.000]   I see.
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   You know what to do.
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:11.000]   There you go.
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:13.000]   And then his other one was Google letting you live forever.
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   It was that little way of saying sorry about Google Reader.
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:19.000]   I'll keep you alive.
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:23.000]   We can't get a reader, but we'll keep you alive for a few more years.
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:26.000]   So you've been experienced the future of news discovery.
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:32.000]   So speaking of companies or sites that Google has funded or has been involved in, which
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:39.000]   seems has a much more clearer business sense to me anyway, is the constitute site.
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:41.000]   It's constituteproject.org.
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:48.400]   This is a website which has archived every single constitution currently in force across
[00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:55.240]   the world with ambitions to make available every constitution that's ever been in force
[00:47:55.240 --> 00:47:58.240]   across the world throughout history.
[00:47:58.240 --> 00:48:00.240]   This is pretty amazing.
[00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:06.560]   I actually didn't realize that it wasn't possible to look up any country's constitution, but
[00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:09.240]   apparently it was not until this site came along.
[00:48:09.240 --> 00:48:14.800]   So if you go to constituteproject.org, you can browse by country or you can browse by
[00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:18.320]   topic and you read any country's constitution.
[00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:24.240]   This was funded partially by Google ideas, which is kind of their Google's political
[00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:27.160]   think/do tank, they call it.
[00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:28.680]   But yeah, pretty neat site.
[00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:34.640]   And this clearly aligns with Google's mission of organizing all the world's information.
[00:48:34.640 --> 00:48:36.120]   And our rights and principles.
[00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:40.040]   And let's not forget that Iceland, well first, there were some old friends of mine, Iranian
[00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:45.560]   friends of mine, who tried to create a wiki rewriting of the Iranian constitution way
[00:48:45.560 --> 00:48:46.560]   back in the day.
[00:48:46.560 --> 00:48:51.200]   And a decade ago, which I thought was a great idea, but Iceland, to a very extent, did
[00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:52.200]   that.
[00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:56.680]   The open source had opened up at least the writing of the constitution, which I think
[00:48:56.680 --> 00:48:58.040]   was a very cool thing.
[00:48:58.040 --> 00:49:05.280]   And so now to see the best breed in here and to see what rights are protected and not.
[00:49:05.280 --> 00:49:08.720]   When we break down national barriers, I think it's a nice thing to have.
[00:49:08.720 --> 00:49:12.240]   How about free speech in there, Jan?
[00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:16.400]   I'm just smiling because the United Kingdom isn't there.
[00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:20.440]   Because you have no constitution, you fools.
[00:49:20.440 --> 00:49:25.520]   You need a First Amendment, especially now with the GCHQ.
[00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:26.760]   We do have Magna Carta.
[00:49:26.760 --> 00:49:32.360]   But it's old and the 16th area, but of rights.
[00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:33.360]   But yes.
[00:49:33.360 --> 00:49:37.560]   You need to move beyond the one block dot out there.
[00:49:37.560 --> 00:49:38.560]   Yeah.
[00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:42.240]   No, it's just the UK is not there.
[00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:46.000]   I'm very well, okay, I haven't searched for Great Britain, hang on maybe.
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:52.160]   The other problem is what the hell do I search for to find my country?
[00:49:52.160 --> 00:49:53.160]   They're a couple options.
[00:49:53.160 --> 00:49:58.400]   United Kingdom, Great Britain, Northern Ireland is the thing I would search for, but I don't
[00:49:58.400 --> 00:49:59.200]   see it.
[00:49:59.200 --> 00:50:00.200]   No constitution.
[00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:01.200]   No constitution.
[00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:02.200]   No written constitution.
[00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:12.200]   Did you guys experience any email delays yesterday in Gmail?
[00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:13.200]   Did you go on?
[00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:14.200]   No, a few hours.
[00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:15.200]   Yeah, me neither.
[00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:16.880]   I think I get a lot of email.
[00:50:16.880 --> 00:50:19.640]   Honestly, I'd welcome a seven hour break from email.
[00:50:19.640 --> 00:50:20.640]   Well, whoever.
[00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:21.640]   However, we're.
[00:50:21.640 --> 00:50:23.400]   That's not so much free email anyway.
[00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:24.840]   It's like, okay, I'll look at this sometime.
[00:50:24.840 --> 00:50:26.400]   Well, this is the thing, right?
[00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:28.280]   Email is not, it's not I am.
[00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:29.440]   It's not instantaneous.
[00:50:29.440 --> 00:50:30.440]   It's asynchronous.
[00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:35.440]   But on Monday, Google said that less than 50% of Gmail's user base, which to be fair,
[00:50:35.440 --> 00:50:38.120]   50% is a lot of people.
[00:50:38.120 --> 00:50:42.040]   People were seeing email slowdowns where messages weren't arriving in a timely fashion.
[00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:44.080]   Again, I don't know what timely is on the one.
[00:50:44.080 --> 00:50:48.080]   When I send an email, I assume it has to sort of wind its way across the internet to arrive
[00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:49.520]   in someone's inbox.
[00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:54.560]   But messages weren't arriving in timely fashion and some of attachments, I guess, weren't
[00:50:54.560 --> 00:50:55.560]   downloading.
[00:50:55.560 --> 00:50:56.560]   But Google apologized.
[00:50:56.560 --> 00:51:00.160]   Apparently, a couple of their networks had gone down at the same time, which is sort
[00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:02.600]   of a rare occurrence.
[00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:08.840]   And they said that the on average, the average delivery delay was 2.6 seconds.
[00:51:08.840 --> 00:51:11.440]   I mean, really do we care about this?
[00:51:11.440 --> 00:51:14.360]   71% of messages were unaffected.
[00:51:14.360 --> 00:51:20.400]   But it's just interesting that people have such talk about dependence, right, on Google.
[00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:22.960]   Depending on Google, anything happens with Gmail.
[00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:24.800]   A lot of people notice right away.
[00:51:24.800 --> 00:51:28.920]   But also this expectation that email would get delivered, you know, instantaneously.
[00:51:28.920 --> 00:51:33.840]   It is like the Louis CK routine, when he makes a lot of people complain that they can't use
[00:51:33.840 --> 00:51:36.160]   their kindles on the airplane that was taking off.
[00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:41.520]   But it's like, listen, you've got your butt attached to this huge machine and it's flying,
[00:51:41.520 --> 00:51:42.520]   isn't it?
[00:51:42.520 --> 00:51:46.600]   Everything is amazing and no one is happy, Jeff.
[00:51:46.600 --> 00:51:47.600]   It's true.
[00:51:47.600 --> 00:51:48.600]   It's true.
[00:51:48.600 --> 00:51:53.580]   It's like when the iPod launch, it was like, yeah, but it doesn't have expandable storage,
[00:51:53.580 --> 00:51:55.800]   you know, and change the world.
[00:51:55.800 --> 00:51:58.720]   So what else do we have here?
[00:51:58.720 --> 00:52:00.240]   Oh, so Google Glass, it's interesting.
[00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:02.120]   Google Glass was a Google X project, right?
[00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:05.600]   But part of me thinks, I don't know, part of me thinks that maybe Google Glass is going
[00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:08.760]   to be one of those spring cleaning projects someday.
[00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:09.760]   Really?
[00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:13.240]   Yeah, I mean, I don't think we've come to that place, but I wouldn't be surprised if
[00:52:13.240 --> 00:52:15.960]   at some point, I mean, we're still, I think we're still going to see the glassware.
[00:52:15.960 --> 00:52:17.960]   I think it's a really good point.
[00:52:17.960 --> 00:52:25.760]   Larry said at the conference that I don't get invited to that he thought that Google
[00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:27.840]   Glass was just super and just great.
[00:52:27.840 --> 00:52:28.840]   Oh, okay.
[00:52:28.840 --> 00:52:30.480]   Very excited about Google Glass.
[00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:32.240]   Well, but that's what he says today.
[00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:33.240]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:52:33.240 --> 00:52:38.320]   Well, turns out Glass isn't going to get released in Europe very soon anyway.
[00:52:38.320 --> 00:52:41.080]   I mean, it sounds like we've been hearing rumors that, you know, there's going to be
[00:52:41.080 --> 00:52:45.280]   a glass store and I'll probably be available to consumers here in the US next year.
[00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:49.760]   But in Europe, there are privacy concerns, which I'll let Jeff play.
[00:52:49.760 --> 00:52:51.200]   No, it's a bit higher.
[00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:54.120]   But also interestingly that the voice recognition doesn't work.
[00:52:54.120 --> 00:52:58.360]   The voice recognition on Glass doesn't work as well on people with foreign accents.
[00:52:58.360 --> 00:53:00.200]   They can fix that.
[00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:02.000]   Yeah, they've got to be able to fix that.
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:03.000]   They've got to be able to fix that.
[00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:08.400]   Well, I want to know, Gina, is when you're home in Brooklyn, how well Google Glass works
[00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:10.440]   versus when you're in California?
[00:53:10.440 --> 00:53:20.360]   I'm sure that when I'm in Brooklyn, Glass would be a lot more useful because I'm actually
[00:53:20.360 --> 00:53:21.360]   asking about your accent.
[00:53:21.360 --> 00:53:24.600]   But there's a lot more to understand you.
[00:53:24.600 --> 00:53:25.600]   Yeah.
[00:53:25.600 --> 00:53:29.360]   I was talking about sort of the denseness of the need for directions and just spending
[00:53:29.360 --> 00:53:30.360]   a lot more time walking.
[00:53:30.360 --> 00:53:32.560]   But yeah, my accent, that's right.
[00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:37.080]   As soon as I'm around my family, Glass is going to knock it, recognize my OK Glass commands.
[00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:38.080]   Yo, Glass.
[00:53:38.080 --> 00:53:39.080]   Yo, Glass.
[00:53:39.080 --> 00:53:40.080]   Yo, Glass.
[00:53:40.080 --> 00:53:41.080]   Yo, Glass.
[00:53:41.080 --> 00:53:42.080]   Fight Alice, come on.
[00:53:42.080 --> 00:53:43.080]   Yeah, I think of it.
[00:53:43.080 --> 00:53:44.080]   Excuse me, Glass.
[00:53:44.080 --> 00:53:45.080]   Excuse me, Christ.
[00:53:45.080 --> 00:53:54.920]   If it's not too much trouble, Glass, or the Canadian version, I'm sorry, Glass.
[00:53:54.920 --> 00:53:55.920]   Sorry, Glass.
[00:53:55.920 --> 00:53:56.920]   Sorry, Glass.
[00:53:56.920 --> 00:53:57.920]   Tell me a boot.
[00:53:57.920 --> 00:54:04.920]   So let's see, what else do we have?
[00:54:04.920 --> 00:54:07.280]   One last story and then we'll go on to the change log.
[00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:08.280]   The Google Science Fair.
[00:54:08.280 --> 00:54:10.280]   I love the idea that you're very interested in yourself.
[00:54:10.280 --> 00:54:11.280]   We're announced.
[00:54:11.280 --> 00:54:13.040]   Yeah, I will have to introduce myself.
[00:54:13.040 --> 00:54:15.120]   These are the Google Science Fair.
[00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:19.920]   Teens face down flu viruses, energy crises, and the winning Google Science Fair entries.
[00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:21.720]   I love this.
[00:54:21.720 --> 00:54:24.560]   Smiling teenagers holding what look to be Lego, Lego trophies.
[00:54:24.560 --> 00:54:25.560]   They're great trophies.
[00:54:25.560 --> 00:54:27.280]   They're Lego trophies, yeah.
[00:54:27.280 --> 00:54:28.280]   Very, very cool.
[00:54:28.280 --> 00:54:29.280]   I love those.
[00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:30.280]   Very, very cool trophies.
[00:54:30.280 --> 00:54:35.720]   Yeah, 17 year old, winner of the Google Science Fair.
[00:54:35.720 --> 00:54:40.880]   The young researcher, Eric Chen, he worked on accelerating the development of new antiviral
[00:54:40.880 --> 00:54:43.120]   drugs that could save lives in the science fair.
[00:54:43.120 --> 00:54:44.120]   Very, very cool.
[00:54:44.120 --> 00:54:45.920]   There's a few really cool stories of teenagers.
[00:54:45.920 --> 00:54:50.400]   There's one girl I think one is one we showed a video on the show months ago where she
[00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:52.400]   has the human heat powered flashlights.
[00:54:52.400 --> 00:54:56.600]   Oh, yeah, the flashlight that's powered by the heater hand.
[00:54:56.600 --> 00:54:59.040]   Yeah, she was brilliant.
[00:54:59.040 --> 00:55:00.040]   Very cool.
[00:55:00.040 --> 00:55:01.040]   Very, very cool.
[00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:02.680]   All right, what do you say?
[00:55:02.680 --> 00:55:05.680]   Should we break out the horns?
[00:55:05.680 --> 00:55:06.680]   Yep.
[00:55:06.680 --> 00:55:11.880]   Chat, be ready for the change log.
[00:55:11.880 --> 00:55:18.720]   The Google change log.
[00:55:18.720 --> 00:55:19.720]   Loving it, loving it.
[00:55:19.720 --> 00:55:22.840]   All right, we got a bunch of changes going on in Google, Google land this year.
[00:55:22.840 --> 00:55:25.800]   Oh, this week, excuse me, this year.
[00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:30.400]   The YouTube announced a new commenting system powered by Google+, it's going to feature
[00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:33.440]   threaded, ranked, and private conversations.
[00:55:33.440 --> 00:55:37.040]   So Google's trying to tackle the commenting problem that YouTube has.
[00:55:37.040 --> 00:55:40.400]   So this is going to be launching on channel discussion tab this week and it'll roll out
[00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:42.680]   to all videos over the next few weeks and months.
[00:55:42.680 --> 00:55:47.800]   So basically, the new system is going to try to, is going to rank automatically rank
[00:55:47.800 --> 00:55:52.760]   comments and feature threaded and private conversations based on a variety of factors.
[00:55:52.760 --> 00:55:57.160]   So comments from the video creator, for example, will be ranked very highly.
[00:55:57.160 --> 00:56:00.800]   The system will push comments from popular personalities on YouTube and people in your
[00:56:00.800 --> 00:56:03.600]   Google+ circles, higher up in the comment chain.
[00:56:03.600 --> 00:56:07.920]   So you'll see the stuff that's more relevant to you sooner as well as highly engaged discussion
[00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:08.920]   about the video.
[00:56:08.920 --> 00:56:12.940]   So if you have a really active thread going on, and just like before, you'll be able to
[00:56:12.940 --> 00:56:17.600]   vote comments up or down and those votes will influence ranking as well.
[00:56:17.600 --> 00:56:20.760]   This is going to be a huge, I feel like this is going to be a huge shake up of the YouTube
[00:56:20.760 --> 00:56:21.760]   community.
[00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:22.760]   More, more.
[00:56:22.760 --> 00:56:23.760]   Yes.
[00:56:23.760 --> 00:56:31.040]   I remember going to the YouTube person in 2000 or 2008 or so and saying, "Hey, social
[00:56:31.040 --> 00:56:32.320]   comments, think about that.
[00:56:32.320 --> 00:56:34.440]   That would be a really good thing instead of just sorting them by time."
[00:56:34.440 --> 00:56:35.440]   And he was like, "Oh, wow."
[00:56:35.440 --> 00:56:37.920]   And I don't know how you could do that.
[00:56:37.920 --> 00:56:38.920]   But yeah.
[00:56:38.920 --> 00:56:44.200]   And part of it is just the sheer volume of comments on YouTube is so much bigger than
[00:56:44.200 --> 00:56:46.600]   anything else that they tend to throw their hands up.
[00:56:46.600 --> 00:56:50.600]   But giving people, I think the other part of this is it's giving more control to the
[00:56:50.600 --> 00:56:53.760]   people who post the videos to be able to moderate their comments rather than just
[00:56:53.760 --> 00:56:59.240]   like being drowned in complete flame and ghastliness as soon as you post anything.
[00:56:59.240 --> 00:57:00.640]   So I think that's important.
[00:57:00.640 --> 00:57:06.080]   This sort of fits my sort of tunneling thing of tools for tunnelers, letting people have
[00:57:06.080 --> 00:57:08.240]   more control of the conversation by giving them better tools to do it.
[00:57:08.240 --> 00:57:09.800]   So I welcome this.
[00:57:09.800 --> 00:57:15.240]   I'm looking forward to this and improving the nastiness that is YouTube comments.
[00:57:15.240 --> 00:57:19.000]   But the challenge is that because that culture is already in place, it's going to take some
[00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:21.000]   real work to shift the culture.
[00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:22.880]   That's very hard with any of these systems.
[00:57:22.880 --> 00:57:25.040]   So were you asking Chad to, Gina?
[00:57:25.040 --> 00:57:26.040]   Yeah.
[00:57:26.040 --> 00:57:27.320]   I mean, Chad, you're really active on YouTube.
[00:57:27.320 --> 00:57:28.920]   You do show this week in YouTube.
[00:57:28.920 --> 00:57:31.760]   I'm sure that people on YouTube are going to freak out about this.
[00:57:31.760 --> 00:57:32.760]   This is a huge change.
[00:57:32.760 --> 00:57:33.760]   Yeah.
[00:57:33.760 --> 00:57:36.960]   This is really exciting because also like what I do is whenever I make a video, I share
[00:57:36.960 --> 00:57:38.840]   it almost immediately on Google+.
[00:57:38.840 --> 00:57:45.080]   And all of it always feels like I'm cheating either myself or the other fans that there
[00:57:45.080 --> 00:57:50.680]   are comments all on that post that never see the light of day on the other video.
[00:57:50.680 --> 00:57:55.400]   And sometimes I even mentioned like, oh, in the next video, oh, on Google+, someone commented
[00:57:55.400 --> 00:57:57.080]   and said this.
[00:57:57.080 --> 00:58:01.840]   And I always do feel like I'm cheating the YouTube audience for not, you know, maybe
[00:58:01.840 --> 00:58:05.320]   they feel like I'm not paying enough attention.
[00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:11.600]   On top of that, a few weeks ago, Google deprecated the video responses on YouTube.
[00:58:11.600 --> 00:58:16.320]   And this seems like this may be what they were teasing way back then when they said,
[00:58:16.320 --> 00:58:18.080]   we're going to give you new ways to connect.
[00:58:18.080 --> 00:58:23.840]   So maybe this will even allow for a video comment.
[00:58:23.840 --> 00:58:24.840]   That would be really cool.
[00:58:24.840 --> 00:58:26.560]   I hope that would be cool.
[00:58:26.560 --> 00:58:27.560]   Yeah.
[00:58:27.560 --> 00:58:31.560]   Maybe, you know, maybe if you mentioned something, you can do something else.
[00:58:31.560 --> 00:58:34.960]   That's pure speculation and just a hopefulness.
[00:58:34.960 --> 00:58:38.960]   But yeah, this is really neat for YouTube creators.
[00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:45.680]   I mean, I know that when YouTube sort of started to ask users to link their Google+ account,
[00:58:45.680 --> 00:58:49.360]   which requires real names to their YouTube account, that there was a lot of backlash.
[00:58:49.360 --> 00:58:51.640]   A lot of people didn't like that idea, right?
[00:58:51.640 --> 00:58:52.720]   Because they didn't use their real names.
[00:58:52.720 --> 00:58:54.520]   They wanted to keep their YouTube handle.
[00:58:54.520 --> 00:58:58.480]   And I think, Chad, correct me if I'm wrong, I think that that's still optional.
[00:58:58.480 --> 00:58:59.480]   I don't think you have to--
[00:58:59.480 --> 00:59:02.320]   At the moment, they've been pushing it a lot more.
[00:59:02.320 --> 00:59:03.320]   Yeah.
[00:59:03.320 --> 00:59:08.440]   In fact, it got to the point where every single time I went to YouTube with a classic YouTube
[00:59:08.440 --> 00:59:13.680]   account that it would ask me every single time I went to just YouTube.com.
[00:59:13.680 --> 00:59:16.560]   And so I ended up switching.
[00:59:16.560 --> 00:59:23.520]   There's definitely still a little bit of pain on my end there was.
[00:59:23.520 --> 00:59:26.880]   But I think that-- I switched it.
[00:59:26.880 --> 00:59:30.600]   You have the choice of either creating-- especially if you want to keep that username.
[00:59:30.600 --> 00:59:35.520]   You have the choice of either creating a page that you could add managers to, a Google+
[00:59:35.520 --> 00:59:40.120]   page that you could add managers to, or using your profile.
[00:59:40.120 --> 00:59:42.840]   And there's pluses and minuses to each of those.
[00:59:42.840 --> 00:59:48.560]   And that's where the sort of pain comes in, is that I wanted managers to help with the
[00:59:48.560 --> 00:59:55.080]   channel so that I wouldn't have to give people my Google password, which is now my Yahoo--
[00:59:55.080 --> 00:59:57.080]   Or my Gmail password.
[00:59:57.080 --> 01:00:00.520]   Gmail password controls everything, right?
[01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:07.720]   But then also, I don't really need a page for myself because I'm already myself on a
[01:00:07.720 --> 01:00:10.040]   different on Google+.
[01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:12.440]   So there is a little bit of confusion there.
[01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:16.960]   So that's why there's an OMG chat on Google+ and there's also a Chad Johnson on Google
[01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:17.960]  +.
[01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:25.080]   Ah, I wonder if with this change, if you post a video to both-- to YouTube and Google+,
[01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:29.480]   if those comment threads will mirror, like if someone makes a comment on Google+, will
[01:00:29.480 --> 01:00:30.480]   that also show up on YouTube?
[01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:31.480]   So what I'm--
[01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:32.480]   They have to be separate threads.
[01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:39.960]   Yeah, what I'm hoping and based off of the screenshot is that if you share it on Google
[01:00:39.960 --> 01:00:45.080]  +, it will have whatever you enter into the text box as a comment.
[01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:51.920]   So if you say, "Well, if I post on my channel and I say, I made a vlog and I had a great
[01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:55.880]   time with such and such and such and such, that will show up as a comment."
[01:00:55.880 --> 01:01:03.240]   And then anything-- anyone who comments on top of that post will show up underneath as
[01:01:03.240 --> 01:01:07.200]   the replies, which is sort of what this image is suggesting.
[01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:08.920]   Oh, via Google+, yeah.
[01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:13.440]   Right, so there's the via Google+, which would be whatever you write in your descriptor,
[01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:16.280]   and then these replies are the replies to the post.
[01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:20.280]   And of course, it's not going to strip-- it'll strip out the embedded video, which shows
[01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:22.080]   up on the Google+ page.
[01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:23.080]   Right.
[01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:25.280]   So that's why I imagine it to work.
[01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:26.280]   Oh, that's really cool.
[01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:29.400]   So you have everybody commenting on the same content.
[01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:30.720]   And so everyone gets to see everybody else's comments.
[01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:33.880]   So you're not going to have the problem that you have where you're like, "Oh, or Google+."
[01:01:33.880 --> 01:01:34.880]   Somebody said this.
[01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:35.880]   Exactly.
[01:01:35.880 --> 01:01:38.640]   Well, no, no, not quite, because you can have private comments.
[01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:42.400]   You can set it up so that the Google+ comments are just to a circle.
[01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:46.320]   Yeah, especially to-- that's the other-- whatever the other thing's called, that isn't a circle
[01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:49.160]   that you have to community.
[01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:50.160]   Yes.
[01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:54.840]   So you can still have full comments, but the ones you see will be the ones that you want
[01:01:54.840 --> 01:01:58.600]   to-- the circles or communities that your members of.
[01:01:58.600 --> 01:01:59.600]   Yes.
[01:01:59.600 --> 01:02:07.080]   So imagine you send it to your family circle and you say, "This is the local sheriff department
[01:02:07.080 --> 01:02:09.040]   talking about this thing."
[01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:11.160]   And then you could just trash that sheriff.
[01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:12.440]   You could make fun of them.
[01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:17.160]   And only your circle of family, if they go to the page, could see those comments, because
[01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:18.400]   that's all you shared it with.
[01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:19.400]   Right, right.
[01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:20.400]   So look at this idiot.
[01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:21.400]   Yeah.
[01:02:21.400 --> 01:02:22.400]   Not everybody will see that.
[01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:23.400]   Got it.
[01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:24.400]   Got it.
[01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:26.280]   Got it as a non-YouTube user.
[01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:29.760]   I assume that this is going to be just a big change for the community and culture there.
[01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:33.680]   And I think I expect that people will be upset about it when it happens.
[01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:34.680]   But I think it'll make comments--
[01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:38.240]   Well, the ones that are going to be always upset are the trolls, and I think.
[01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:40.040]   And so I think that's kind of OK.
[01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:41.040]   And they--
[01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:45.360]   I also-- the fact that you can use Google+ comments now on YouTube and also Google+--
[01:02:45.360 --> 01:02:49.160]   the other thing, when I shared this on Google+ I said, I really would like to be able to
[01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:53.720]   put this on my blog and have the comments there, work across both, which would be great.
[01:02:53.720 --> 01:02:54.720]   And Bradley Horowitz--
[01:02:54.720 --> 01:02:55.720]   I put his name in it.
[01:02:55.720 --> 01:02:58.440]   Bradley Horowitz, the head of Google+ responded.
[01:02:58.440 --> 01:02:59.440]   Interesting idea.
[01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:00.440]   So--
[01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:01.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:04.120]   It's always-- it seems like that's always Bradley's response.
[01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:05.120]   And then we get it--
[01:03:05.120 --> 01:03:06.120]   Yeah, that's a safe response.
[01:03:06.120 --> 01:03:07.120]   --a goody a few months down.
[01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:08.120]   Yeah, yeah, a few months in.
[01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:09.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:10.120]   All right, so keep an eye on--
[01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:11.120]   It's only--
[01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:12.120]   It was an eight-year-old.
[01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:13.120]   --the change was--
[01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:14.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:15.120]   --only.
[01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:16.120]   It's only.
[01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:20.160]   So moving along with the change log, Google's got a new flat logo.
[01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:21.160]   Everybody's getting flat.
[01:03:21.160 --> 01:03:24.120]   New flat logo and an app launcher style nav.
[01:03:24.120 --> 01:03:25.120]   That's going to be official.
[01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:27.240]   And it's rolling out over the next few weeks.
[01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:31.720]   So I actually-- I'm not seeing this in my log then Chrome, but I opened up an incognito
[01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:35.440]   window and just went to google.com and saw this.
[01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:36.640]   So basically, here's a change.
[01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:41.120]   The black bar that used to run atop all of Google's properties, that's going away.
[01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:44.040]   And this redesign, the black bar, has been replaced with a new menu.
[01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:47.000]   It kind of sits next to the share and account information.
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:54.320]   It looks like the grid of boxes, which is the same button, which launches apps in Chrome.
[01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:55.320]   Yeah, there we go.
[01:03:55.320 --> 01:03:56.320]   Thanks, Chad.
[01:03:56.320 --> 01:03:57.320]   Right there.
[01:03:57.320 --> 01:03:58.320]   Yeah.
[01:03:58.320 --> 01:03:59.320]   Yeah.
[01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:00.320]   Yeah.
[01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:01.320]   So they're kind of unifying this.
[01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:04.200]   This is how you get to the rest of Google.
[01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:07.880]   And I have to say, I'm not sad to see that black bar go.
[01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:14.760]   So you'll see the black bar leave your google.com homepage and other Google properties over
[01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:16.520]   the next few weeks.
[01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:22.400]   Gmail for Android got a little update today, or the last couple of days.
[01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:25.000]   Actually, I think it was today or yesterday.
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:29.360]   Just a little redesign, updates with the leaner conversation view and improved multi-select.
[01:04:29.360 --> 01:04:35.080]   So it's much easier to select multiple conversations and see that you're going to perform a batch
[01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:38.800]   action across many conversations.
[01:04:38.800 --> 01:04:42.240]   You tap on the user icon in order to do that.
[01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:46.800]   So if your account sync is off, you'll get a big notification at the top of the page
[01:04:46.800 --> 01:04:50.640]   at the chat showing off right now telling you that account sync is off and you should
[01:04:50.640 --> 01:04:53.960]   turn it on in order to get new messages.
[01:04:53.960 --> 01:04:57.040]   Google Wallet makes its iOS debut.
[01:04:57.040 --> 01:04:59.400]   And this is without NFC support.
[01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:02.480]   So the payments app is now available for iDevices.
[01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:04.840]   And with it, you can transfer money to friends.
[01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:05.840]   You can store.
[01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:09.760]   You can track loyalty card activity and nearby offers.
[01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:14.000]   App to pay doesn't work on iDevices because they don't support NFC.
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:18.240]   But you can do basically everything else that an Android user can do on iOS now.
[01:05:18.240 --> 01:05:21.920]   And if you lose your phone or tablet, you can disable the Google Wallet app remotely
[01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:25.200]   on the Google Wallet website.
[01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:30.520]   Also on iOS, Google Translate for iOS adds handwriting support and a new UI.
[01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:33.400]   The new UI is just redesigned for iOS 7.
[01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:38.640]   And now, just like you can do with Google, you can input characters via handwriting.
[01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:41.880]   You can tap the handwriting button and write your name.
[01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:42.880]   Not my handwriting.
[01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:45.360]   I am writing my work.
[01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:49.880]   It's a slow input method, but it works and is now available on iOS.
[01:05:49.880 --> 01:05:51.920]   Can you track Chinese characters?
[01:05:51.920 --> 01:05:52.920]   Yeah.
[01:05:52.920 --> 01:05:54.920]   Yes, these apps are cool.
[01:05:54.920 --> 01:05:55.920]   Yeah.
[01:05:55.920 --> 01:05:56.920]   Yeah.
[01:05:56.920 --> 01:05:57.920]   Make sure you get it right though.
[01:05:57.920 --> 01:05:59.920]   You can't be too fiddly.
[01:05:59.920 --> 01:06:04.560]   Oh, and it looks like we have a late entry.
[01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:06.320]   Oh, thanks, Jeff.
[01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:09.960]   Google starts supporting Google+ hashtags in search queries.
[01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:10.960]   Oh, look at this.
[01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:13.680]   So you can search on Google, regular Google.com search.
[01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:15.040]   You can search for hashtags.
[01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:17.360]   So like Emmys.
[01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:19.120]   And it will return.
[01:06:19.120 --> 01:06:23.360]   So now does this return web pages with the hashtag in them or with the word?
[01:06:23.360 --> 01:06:24.360]   It looks like--
[01:06:24.360 --> 01:06:29.560]   I don't know whether that's or is it or-- well, on Google+, when you ask for a hashtag, it
[01:06:29.560 --> 01:06:30.560]   doesn't just give you the hashtag.
[01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:33.400]   It gives you, I think, things that it knows are relevant.
[01:06:33.400 --> 01:06:35.080]   Things that he knows are relevant, right, right?
[01:06:35.080 --> 01:06:37.080]   So that makes a lot of sense.
[01:06:37.080 --> 01:06:38.080]   Yeah, very cool.
[01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:39.080]   But of course, ideally--
[01:06:39.080 --> 01:06:40.080]   But of course, ideally--
[01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:45.280]   This should include Twitter feed, but of course, that marriage went asunder.
[01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:47.960]   Yeah, unfortunately.
[01:06:47.960 --> 01:06:49.440]   It should be right.
[01:06:49.440 --> 01:06:53.760]   And actually, somebody would do well to make-- and this would be a very simple Chrome extension
[01:06:53.760 --> 01:07:01.200]   to make is to embed in an iFrame or some such a Twitter search for that hashtag as well.
[01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:05.040]   Well, the answer to the question is, if I search for hashtag Emmys, I can't--
[01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:06.040]   I can't even say it's the same.
[01:07:06.040 --> 01:07:07.040]   I can't even say it's the same.
[01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:08.040]   I can't even say it's the same.
[01:07:08.040 --> 01:07:09.040]   I can't even say it's the same.
[01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:10.040]   I can't even say it's the same.
[01:07:10.040 --> 01:07:11.040]   I can't even say it's the same.
[01:07:11.040 --> 01:07:12.040]   I can't even say it's the same.
[01:07:12.040 --> 01:07:13.040]   I can't even say it's the same.
[01:07:13.040 --> 01:07:14.040]   But it's a very simple thing.
[01:07:14.040 --> 01:07:15.040]   It's a very simple thing.
[01:07:15.040 --> 01:07:16.040]   And I can't say it's the same thing.
[01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:17.040]   I can't even say it's the same thing.
[01:07:17.040 --> 01:07:18.040]   I can't even say it's the same thing.
[01:07:18.040 --> 01:07:19.040]   I can't even say it's the same thing.
[01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:20.040]   I can't even say it's the same thing.
[01:07:20.040 --> 01:07:21.040]   I can't even say it's the same thing.
[01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:22.040]   I can't even say it's the same thing.
[01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:23.040]   I can't even say it's the same thing.
[01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:43.040]   I can't even say it's the same thing.
[01:07:43.040 --> 01:08:09.040]   I can't even say it's the same thing.
[01:08:09.040 --> 01:08:16.040]   I can't even say it's the same thing.
[01:08:16.040 --> 01:08:17.040]   I can't even say it's the same thing.
[01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:18.040]   I can't even say it's the same thing.
[01:08:18.040 --> 01:08:19.040]   I can't even say it's the same thing.
[01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:20.040]   I can't even say it's the same thing.
[01:08:20.040 --> 01:08:21.040]   I can't even say it's the same thing.
[01:08:21.040 --> 01:08:22.040]   I can't even say it's the same thing.
[01:08:22.040 --> 01:08:23.040]   I can't even say it's the same thing.
[01:08:23.040 --> 01:08:24.040]   I can't even say it's the same thing.
[01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:25.040]   I can't even say it's the same thing.
[01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:26.040]   I can't even say it's the same thing.
[01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:27.040]   I can't even say it's the same thing.
[01:08:27.040 --> 01:08:28.040]   I can't even say it's the same thing.
[01:08:28.040 --> 01:08:29.040]   I can't even say it's the same thing.
[01:08:29.040 --> 01:08:30.040]   I can't even say it's the same thing.
[01:08:30.040 --> 01:08:31.040]   I can't even say it's the same thing.
[01:08:31.040 --> 01:08:38.040]   I can't even say it's the same thing.
[01:08:38.040 --> 01:08:39.040]   I can't even say it's the same thing.
[01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:40.040]   I can't even say it's the same thing.
[01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:41.040]   I can't even say it's the same thing.
[01:08:41.040 --> 01:08:42.040]   I can't even say it's the same thing.
[01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:43.040]   I can't even say it's the same thing.
[01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:44.040]   I can't even say it's the same thing.
[01:08:44.040 --> 01:08:45.040]   I can't even say it's the same thing.
[01:08:45.040 --> 01:08:46.040]   I can't even say it's the same thing.
[01:08:46.040 --> 01:08:47.040]   I can't even say it's the same thing.
[01:08:47.040 --> 01:08:48.040]   I can't even say it's the same thing.
[01:08:48.040 --> 01:08:49.040]   I can't even say it's the same thing.
[01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:50.040]   I can't even say it's the same thing.
[01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:51.040]   I can't even say it's the same thing.
[01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:52.040]   I can't even say it's the same thing.
[01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:53.040]   I can't even say it's the same thing.
[01:08:53.040 --> 01:09:00.040]   I can't even say it's the same thing.
[01:09:00.040 --> 01:09:01.040]   I can't even say it's the same thing.
[01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:02.040]   I can't even say it's the same thing.
[01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:03.040]   I can't even say it's the same thing.
[01:09:03.040 --> 01:09:04.040]   I can't even say it's the same thing.
[01:09:04.040 --> 01:09:05.040]   I can't even say it's the same thing.
[01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:06.040]   I can't even say it's the same thing.
[01:09:06.040 --> 01:09:07.040]   I can't even say it's the same thing.
[01:09:07.040 --> 01:09:08.040]   I can't even say it's the same thing.
[01:09:08.040 --> 01:09:09.040]   I can't even say it's the same thing.
[01:09:09.040 --> 01:09:10.040]   I can't even say it's the same thing.
[01:09:10.040 --> 01:09:11.040]   I can't even say it's the same thing.
[01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:12.040]   I can't even say it's the same thing.
[01:09:12.040 --> 01:09:13.040]   I can't even say it's the same thing.
[01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:14.040]   I can't even say it's the same thing.
[01:09:14.040 --> 01:09:15.040]   I can't even say it's the same thing.
[01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:22.040]   I can't even say it's the same thing.
[01:09:22.040 --> 01:09:29.040]   I can't even say it's the same thing.
[01:09:29.040 --> 01:09:36.040]   I can't even say it's the same thing.
[01:09:36.040 --> 01:09:43.040]   I can't even say it's the same thing.
[01:09:43.040 --> 01:09:45.040]   I can't even say it's the same thing.
[01:09:45.040 --> 01:09:46.040]   I can't even say it's the same thing.
[01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:47.040]   I can't even say it's the same thing.
[01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:48.040]   I can't even say it's the same thing.
[01:09:48.040 --> 01:09:49.040]   I can't even say it's the same thing.
[01:09:49.040 --> 01:09:50.040]   I can't even say it's the same thing.
[01:09:50.040 --> 01:09:51.040]   I can't even say it's the same thing.
[01:09:51.040 --> 01:09:52.040]   I can't even say it's the same thing.
[01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:53.040]   I can't even say it's the same thing.
[01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:54.040]   I can't even say it's the same thing.
[01:09:54.040 --> 01:09:55.040]   I can't even say it's the same thing.
[01:09:55.040 --> 01:09:56.040]   I can't even say it's the same thing.
[01:09:56.040 --> 01:09:57.040]   I can't even say it's the same thing.
[01:09:57.040 --> 01:09:58.040]   I can't even say it's the same thing.
[01:09:58.040 --> 01:09:59.040]   I can't even say it's the same thing.
[01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:00.040]   I can't even say it's the same thing.
[01:10:00.040 --> 01:10:19.040]   I can't even say it's the same thing.
[01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:22.040]   Sorry, Chad.
[01:10:22.040 --> 01:10:23.040]   I found another one.
[01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:25.040]   I found it when I still clicked on Chrome on iOS 7,
[01:10:25.040 --> 01:10:27.040]   which maybe this happened two weeks ago and I didn't notice.
[01:10:27.040 --> 01:10:30.040]   They've got a new thing that says reduce data usage.
[01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:33.040]   Have you seen this?
[01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:36.040]   Oh, the Chrome compression.
[01:10:36.040 --> 01:10:37.040]   Yeah.
[01:10:37.040 --> 01:10:38.040]   What's it called?
[01:10:38.040 --> 01:10:39.040]   It's got a name.
[01:10:39.040 --> 01:10:40.040]   It's got kind of a clever name.
[01:10:40.040 --> 01:10:45.040]   It's Google's proxy for Chrome traffic that will compress it for you
[01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:47.040]   and will reduce internet traffic.
[01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:49.040]   That's been around for a while.
[01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:51.040]   So had you launched Chrome on iOS and it prompted you about it?
[01:10:51.040 --> 01:10:52.040]   Or you just saw it in the settings?
[01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:53.040]   Yeah.
[01:10:53.040 --> 01:10:55.040]   Are you a little bit of Chrome on iOS and probably about it?
[01:10:55.040 --> 01:10:58.040]   I mean, this is partly because I haven't touched iOS in two and a half weeks
[01:10:58.040 --> 01:11:02.040]   because I found that the Nexus 7 was fine.
[01:11:02.040 --> 01:11:05.040]   So I hadn't actually picked up the tablets and there may have just been
[01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:08.040]   me catching up on a very old setting, but I hadn't seen that before.
[01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:09.040]   That was a...
[01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:10.040]   Right.
[01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:11.040]   Yeah.
[01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:12.040]   Yeah.
[01:11:12.040 --> 01:11:13.040]   This has been out.
[01:11:13.040 --> 01:11:15.040]   Actually, it looks like there was an article on TechCrunch that Google
[01:11:15.040 --> 01:11:18.040]   expands Chrome data compression feature on iOS.
[01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:19.040]   Right.
[01:11:19.040 --> 01:11:20.040]   Right.
[01:11:20.040 --> 01:11:22.040]   And it'll encrypt it as well.
[01:11:22.040 --> 01:11:25.040]   Google's begun expanding access to its Chrome data compression feature
[01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:30.040]   to more users, especially specifically those on iOS devices.
[01:11:30.040 --> 01:11:31.040]   But yeah.
[01:11:31.040 --> 01:11:34.040]   So they announced this feature quite some time ago, but it looks like
[01:11:34.040 --> 01:11:35.040]   they're...
[01:11:35.040 --> 01:11:36.040]   Okay.
[01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:39.040]   They're just rolling out notifications about its iOS availability to more users.
[01:11:39.040 --> 01:11:41.040]   So that's what you're seeing, Kevin.
[01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:42.040]   You're getting the...
[01:11:42.040 --> 01:11:44.040]   You were getting the notification about it.
[01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:46.040]   What...
[01:11:46.040 --> 01:11:47.040]   What else?
[01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:48.040]   There's some Facebook news.
[01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:49.040]   There's some Twitter news.
[01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:51.040]   Do you guys want to pick...
[01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:52.040]   Should we pick a store?
[01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:54.040]   Should we talk about the IPO?
[01:11:54.040 --> 01:11:55.040]   Should we talk about...
[01:11:55.040 --> 01:11:56.040]   I don't know.
[01:11:56.040 --> 01:11:58.040]   I'll give you my favorite Twitter story.
[01:11:58.040 --> 01:11:59.040]   All right.
[01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:00.040]   Yeah.
[01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:01.040]   Yeah.
[01:12:01.040 --> 01:12:02.040]   Go for it.
[01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:04.040]   A guy tries to get on an easy jet flight.
[01:12:04.040 --> 01:12:05.040]   There's delayed.
[01:12:05.040 --> 01:12:09.040]   There being mean to a passenger, so he tweets a complaint about easy jet and they come and
[01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:11.040]   tell him he can't get on the plane.
[01:12:11.040 --> 01:12:14.040]   Oh, they stopped him from getting on the plane?
[01:12:14.040 --> 01:12:19.040]   Then he revealed that he's a lawyer and they made him get on the plane.
[01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:24.040]   It's one of the greatest Twitter fails I've ever seen.
[01:12:24.040 --> 01:12:25.040]   Can you imagine that?
[01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:27.040]   They just call me and say, "You can't say those things like that, sir.
[01:12:27.040 --> 01:12:29.040]   You can't get on this plane then."
[01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:30.040]   Wow.
[01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:31.040]   That's amazing.
[01:12:31.040 --> 01:12:36.040]   So it wasn't a promoted tweet like the JetBlue, or was it JetBlue or I forget what they were
[01:12:36.040 --> 01:12:37.040]   lying about.
[01:12:37.040 --> 01:12:40.040]   Oh, there's some guy lying complaining about them being...
[01:12:40.040 --> 01:12:41.040]   Yeah.
[01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:42.040]   Yeah.
[01:12:42.040 --> 01:12:44.040]   They're being mean to a passenger, so he said something they told me he couldn't get on.
[01:12:44.040 --> 01:12:45.040]   I love that story.
[01:12:45.040 --> 01:12:46.040]   I think that's correct.
[01:12:46.040 --> 01:12:48.040]   What you say matters, indeed.
[01:12:48.040 --> 01:12:52.040]   We talked about MagicRex, who we can speak to Twitter.
[01:12:52.040 --> 01:12:55.040]   We talked about @MagicRex, Twitter experiment.
[01:12:55.040 --> 01:12:57.040]   I think it was a few episodes ago.
[01:12:57.040 --> 01:12:59.040]   It turns out that...
[01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:00.040]   Oh, yeah, it was British Airways.
[01:13:00.040 --> 01:13:01.040]   Thank you, Zach, from the chatroom.
[01:13:01.040 --> 01:13:06.040]   It was British Airways, the guy complaining about British Airways, handling his bag that got promoted.
[01:13:06.040 --> 01:13:09.040]   Oh, it says easy jet here.
[01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:10.040]   No, no, that was a different story.
[01:13:10.040 --> 01:13:11.040]   She's tying to go to the test room.
[01:13:11.040 --> 01:13:12.040]   It's a different story.
[01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:14.040]   Yeah, yeah, it's a ton of other...
[01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:17.040]   So we talked about MagicRex a few episodes ago, and that's the Twitter experiment.
[01:13:17.040 --> 01:13:22.040]   If you follow, you'll get direct messages of recommendations of people to follow and links
[01:13:22.040 --> 01:13:24.040]   that got tweeted and news that got tweeted.
[01:13:24.040 --> 01:13:26.040]   So it turns out that Google...
[01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:27.040]   Oh, this was a Twitter experiment.
[01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:28.040]   This was an official Twitter experiment.
[01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:32.040]   I think maybe it got built during one of their hack days, but they're actually building this
[01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:34.040]   into the regular Twitter experience.
[01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:39.040]   They're going to start rolling out notifications, mobile notifications, of people who you should
[01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:41.040]   follow, people who your friends are following.
[01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:43.040]   So this is pretty cool.
[01:13:43.040 --> 01:13:44.040]   I'm excited.
[01:13:44.040 --> 01:13:49.040]   If they could make it a bit easier to follow, that would be good, because the way it works
[01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:52.040]   the moment, it sends you a do M, and then you would click on the link and actually not
[01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:55.040]   hit the three people that tell us who followed it and then hit follow.
[01:13:55.040 --> 01:13:58.040]   So if they can tune the UX, but I find it useful.
[01:13:58.040 --> 01:14:03.040]   I find it quite handy for finding people who are suddenly bursting in the news or whatever.
[01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:08.040]   Yeah, yeah, I've really enjoyed it, but I agree that DM isn't the best user experience,
[01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:11.040]   but this is Twitter for Android and Twitter for iPhone users.
[01:14:11.040 --> 01:14:13.040]   We'll receive these recommendations via push notification.
[01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:17.040]   So I imagine if they do it well, particularly on Android, if they use the rich notification,
[01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:19.040]   you'll be able to just follow.
[01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:23.040]   Yeah, they think no more push notifications, though.
[01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:26.040]   You can change your settings and you can say don't send me to use.
[01:14:26.040 --> 01:14:27.040]   All right.
[01:14:27.040 --> 01:14:31.040]   What I'd say, I like push notifications.
[01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:34.040]   If you go into your notification settings, there's a recommendations toggle.
[01:14:34.040 --> 01:14:37.040]   You can toggle it off and you won't get you won't get you won't get the problem with getting
[01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:41.040]   the other problem is getting a new tablet or a new phone is having to do.
[01:14:41.040 --> 01:14:46.040]   It's whack-a-mole to find all the notifications and sounds.
[01:14:46.040 --> 01:14:47.040]   Yes.
[01:14:47.040 --> 01:14:48.040]   Sounds that drive me crazy.
[01:14:48.040 --> 01:14:50.040]   I think I've got them all then.
[01:14:50.040 --> 01:14:52.040]   Blah, blah, blah.
[01:14:52.040 --> 01:14:53.040]   Yeah, no, it's true.
[01:14:53.040 --> 01:14:54.040]   It's true.
[01:14:54.040 --> 01:14:55.040]   I spend a good amount of time.
[01:14:55.040 --> 01:14:57.040]   I feel like I can't calibrate this.
[01:14:57.040 --> 01:14:58.040]   I can't calibrate this.
[01:14:58.040 --> 01:14:59.040]   Yeah.
[01:14:59.040 --> 01:15:01.040]   I don't know if it's, maybe it's not.
[01:15:01.040 --> 01:15:02.040]   Let's see if it's gone.
[01:15:02.040 --> 01:15:04.040]   Has it gone out yet?
[01:15:04.040 --> 01:15:06.040]   There's a notification that's in the Twitter app settings.
[01:15:06.040 --> 01:15:11.040]   The only way you can stop it is to pull down on a notification and say, "Android, shut
[01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:14.040]   this app up before me, would you?"
[01:15:14.040 --> 01:15:16.040]   Because that's the problem, because I've got my own app that does notifications.
[01:15:16.040 --> 01:15:20.040]   I want to turn off the ones from Twitter that are much less useful than the ones I use.
[01:15:20.040 --> 01:15:21.040]   Right, right.
[01:15:21.040 --> 01:15:25.040]   The Twitter essentially is one that I don't actually expand to show you the whole tweet
[01:15:25.040 --> 01:15:30.040]   and collapse to say, "Four people said blah and type things," which is just annoying.
[01:15:30.040 --> 01:15:31.040]   Right, right.
[01:15:31.040 --> 01:15:32.040]   At least they stack them.
[01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:33.040]   Yeah, no, I'm not seeing it either.
[01:15:33.040 --> 01:15:36.040]   It's possible that the update just hasn't gone out yet.
[01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:40.040]   If you do prefer the DM, you can just keep following Magigrex, and that'll keep working
[01:15:40.040 --> 01:15:43.040]   the way that it does.
[01:15:43.040 --> 01:15:45.040]   Let's see.
[01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:49.040]   Facebook launches advanced AI effort to find meaning in your post.
[01:15:49.040 --> 01:15:52.040]   This is interesting to me because of my work work on ThinkUp.
[01:15:52.040 --> 01:15:54.040]   Oh, Kevin's laughing.
[01:15:54.040 --> 01:15:55.040]   Stop the headline.
[01:15:55.040 --> 01:15:56.040]   I just love that headline.
[01:15:56.040 --> 01:15:57.040]   Good luck.
[01:15:57.040 --> 01:15:58.040]   So the new research.
[01:15:58.040 --> 01:16:01.040]   I really don't have Facebook posts, so I can't find meaning.
[01:16:01.040 --> 01:16:03.040]   I can't.
[01:16:03.040 --> 01:16:04.040]   I can't.
[01:16:04.040 --> 01:16:06.040]   I'm meaning in your post.
[01:16:06.040 --> 01:16:09.040]   Well, so this is kind of interesting, and it's related to Google and that.
[01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:15.040]   So there's a new research group inside Facebook that's working on building sort of AI into
[01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:21.040]   Facebook so that it can analyze posts to Facebook and recognize people and places and objects,
[01:16:21.040 --> 01:16:25.040]   a lot of how the Knowledge Graphs works on Google, and try to get a sense of, you know,
[01:16:25.040 --> 01:16:30.040]   do things like sentiment analysis and figure out what has happened to people, what they're
[01:16:30.040 --> 01:16:33.040]   trying to do, what they feel about it.
[01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:37.040]   And of course, probably with the end of Wooten there, they're ad targeting.
[01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:40.240]   I mean, you know, obviously Facebook has a lot of technology that tries to get the newsfeed
[01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:46.040]   to be more relevant and, you know, ranks newsfeed items by importance by user, but this is more
[01:16:46.040 --> 01:16:49.040]   of like identifying what people are referring to.
[01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:53.040]   You know, when you say Java, are they talking about the coding language or coffee?
[01:16:53.040 --> 01:16:56.040]   Oh, this is more like, this is remediation and stuff.
[01:16:56.040 --> 01:16:57.040]   Yeah.
[01:16:57.040 --> 01:16:58.040]   Yeah.
[01:16:58.040 --> 01:16:59.040]   Exactly.
[01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:01.040]   I don't mean this remediation.
[01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:04.040]   What's the word I mean?
[01:17:04.040 --> 01:17:07.040]   Two things that seem alike, but you find out which ones which.
[01:17:07.040 --> 01:17:10.040]   This is a big, this is a big issue.
[01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:11.040]   This is a big issue.
[01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:12.040]   Thank you.
[01:17:12.040 --> 01:17:13.040]   There we go.
[01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:14.040]   Yeah.
[01:17:14.040 --> 01:17:15.040]   That's just because it needs Google.
[01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:16.040]   What I have you.
[01:17:16.040 --> 01:17:17.040]   Well, that's OK.
[01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:20.040]   So I'm I've been reading Clive Thompson's new book.
[01:17:20.040 --> 01:17:21.040]   Have you seen if you read this yet?
[01:17:21.040 --> 01:17:22.040]   Have you seen this?
[01:17:22.040 --> 01:17:23.040]   No, what's this?
[01:17:23.040 --> 01:17:24.040]   What's it called?
[01:17:24.040 --> 01:17:25.040]   It's book.
[01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:26.040]   It's called smarter than you think.
[01:17:26.040 --> 01:17:29.040]   And we were here to get trouble for being optimistic about the net.
[01:17:29.040 --> 01:17:30.040]   Yes.
[01:17:30.040 --> 01:17:31.040]   Yes.
[01:17:31.040 --> 01:17:32.040]   No, but it's wonderful.
[01:17:32.040 --> 01:17:34.040]   It's it's it's it's very good because you know, Clive always writes really well.
[01:17:34.040 --> 01:17:39.040]   And this is like a big part of his his wonderful, long form thing stuck to the form of book.
[01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:46.040]   But one of the things he talks about in it is how we discover knowledge and information
[01:17:46.040 --> 01:17:49.040]   and how we actually use each other as repositories for information.
[01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:52.040]   So you can ask a question like that and get a response back from people.
[01:17:52.040 --> 01:17:59.040]   And he says that the way that the Google is is working is is trying to be more like that
[01:17:59.040 --> 01:18:04.040]   than it is like a classic going looking at something in the library and going through
[01:18:04.040 --> 01:18:06.040]   an automated process.
[01:18:06.040 --> 01:18:11.040]   And he says we're very good at adapting to the knowledge that somebody else knows something.
[01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:16.040]   So he says, if you've got married couples, they will each specialize in a very one kind
[01:18:16.040 --> 01:18:17.040]   of thing.
[01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:20.040]   So my wife will remember where we're supposed to be going at the weekend.
[01:18:20.040 --> 01:18:22.040]   And she'll remember how to fix computers or something.
[01:18:22.040 --> 01:18:26.040]   And we will know that each of us will not bother learning the other thing because we can ask
[01:18:26.040 --> 01:18:27.040]   the other about that.
[01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:32.040]   And he says that that effect is what we're starting to see with with Google search with
[01:18:32.040 --> 01:18:38.040]   Wikipedia with bothering to remember phone number things like that is not that the
[01:18:38.040 --> 01:18:42.040]   machines are making us stupid or less rigorous.
[01:18:42.040 --> 01:18:47.040]   It's this that we're fairly good at optimizing use of our brains for things and lying on
[01:18:47.040 --> 01:18:51.040]   other people and other devices for the bits that we don't need to do.
[01:18:51.040 --> 01:18:55.040]   And so that was the thing that was the first thing you just did there was exactly the
[01:18:55.040 --> 01:18:56.040]   kind of thing.
[01:18:56.040 --> 01:18:59.040]   Part of me here, get your drinks ready folks, get your cups ready.
[01:18:59.040 --> 01:19:02.040]   It's the same thing that Gutenberg did.
[01:19:02.040 --> 01:19:07.040]   The before books and before the mass production of books, you had to have things like rhymes
[01:19:07.040 --> 01:19:08.040]   to remember things.
[01:19:08.040 --> 01:19:09.040]   Yes.
[01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:11.040]   Because there was no way to write it down easily.
[01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:13.040]   Paper was nice and very expensive.
[01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:16.040]   And then we had books to remember things.
[01:19:16.040 --> 01:19:18.040]   So yeah, we have Google.
[01:19:18.040 --> 01:19:24.040]   You know, I do think that there are skills that you learn as to how you remember things
[01:19:24.040 --> 01:19:29.040]   that young people today will have different devices to remember things that are different
[01:19:29.040 --> 01:19:31.040]   from what line are.
[01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:34.040]   So he talks about that.
[01:19:34.040 --> 01:19:39.040]   He talks about Socrates and Fedris and that stuff as well.
[01:19:39.040 --> 01:19:45.040]   He also found a great tool, which I will put a piece of tool later.
[01:19:45.040 --> 01:19:49.040]   That's part of the Kindle that is called daily review.
[01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:54.040]   And what it will do is you go to it and it will give you ten highlights from a book you read
[01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:57.040]   a month ago to remind you what that book was about.
[01:19:57.040 --> 01:20:01.040]   And it will adjust the spacing of these to try and encourage you to remember more from the
[01:20:01.040 --> 01:20:02.040]   book.
[01:20:02.040 --> 01:20:06.040]   So it's trying to give you more of that classic recall thing.
[01:20:06.040 --> 01:20:11.040]   Because part of this is that we're very good at recalling things, sort of the general gist
[01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:16.040]   of things and over time we've been the specifics decay.
[01:20:16.040 --> 01:20:22.040]   But you can counter act that by reading and reviewing, which was the point of a commonplace
[01:20:22.040 --> 01:20:23.040]   book.
[01:20:23.040 --> 01:20:24.040]   So this is a way of turning it.
[01:20:24.040 --> 01:20:26.040]   Or you can just Google it.
[01:20:26.040 --> 01:20:27.040]   It's fun.
[01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:30.040]   You know, I really like the daily review.
[01:20:30.040 --> 01:20:33.040]   Like I lost time hop for this reason.
[01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:36.040]   Time hop and think of as a feature where it says like this is what you were thinking about
[01:20:36.040 --> 01:20:39.040]   or talking about two or three years ago on this day.
[01:20:39.040 --> 01:20:41.040]   It's this sort of I haven't asked for it.
[01:20:41.040 --> 01:20:45.040]   I haven't said like, oh, what, you know, but I really like those sort of nostalgia apps.
[01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:49.040]   Those apps, those reminder apps of information that I thought about before because you get
[01:20:49.040 --> 01:20:53.040]   this long term perspective of like, oh, this is the trajectory of my thoughts on this thing.
[01:20:53.040 --> 01:20:55.040]   Or like this is, I was wrestling with that.
[01:20:55.040 --> 01:20:57.040]   It sort of makes these connections.
[01:20:57.040 --> 01:20:59.040]   And I, and I just remember a lot more.
[01:20:59.040 --> 01:21:00.040]   Like my memory is terrible.
[01:21:00.040 --> 01:21:04.040]   But when I get reminded of stuff and I like that daily review and I should look at it more
[01:21:04.040 --> 01:21:06.040]   often for Kindle highlights.
[01:21:06.040 --> 01:21:10.040]   And I'm like, oh, yeah, that book was so good and I can connect that piece of information.
[01:21:10.040 --> 01:21:14.040]   I consumed, you know, a two years ago to something that's going on in my life right now.
[01:21:14.040 --> 01:21:17.040]   And I tend not to to look to look up those things.
[01:21:17.040 --> 01:21:19.040]   It's push versus pull.
[01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:20.040]   Yeah.
[01:21:20.040 --> 01:21:21.040]   Yeah.
[01:21:21.040 --> 01:21:25.040]   So, so, so, so.
[01:21:25.040 --> 01:21:27.040]   Where we go with that disambiguation.
[01:21:27.040 --> 01:21:31.040]   Oh, so, so the thing that Facebook has is that they do have.
[01:21:31.040 --> 01:21:36.040]   So going to memory loss, Kevin, but that's okay.
[01:21:36.040 --> 01:21:39.040]   I don't need these to remind me what I was thinking two years ago, Gina.
[01:21:39.040 --> 01:21:41.040]   I need it for two minutes ago.
[01:21:41.040 --> 01:21:43.040]   Clearly we all do.
[01:21:43.040 --> 01:21:46.040]   There was an awkward pause like, wait, what are we talking about?
[01:21:46.040 --> 01:21:47.040]   Where's the back button?
[01:21:47.040 --> 01:21:49.040]   That's what we need.
[01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:51.040]   Well, he has.
[01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:52.040]   Yeah.
[01:21:52.040 --> 01:21:54.040]   I'm reading about this book because I'm halfway through it.
[01:21:54.040 --> 01:21:56.040]   Here's the life logging thing as well.
[01:21:56.040 --> 01:21:58.040]   The fascinating effects of that.
[01:21:58.040 --> 01:22:01.040]   Where you wear a little camera that takes a photograph every 30 seconds.
[01:22:01.040 --> 01:22:03.040]   At the end of the day, you go, zh, right back through it.
[01:22:03.040 --> 01:22:06.040]   And you go, oh, I had a chat with Jeff and Gina today.
[01:22:06.040 --> 01:22:07.040]   I don't remember that.
[01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:10.040]   And then then it helps you sort of reconsolidate it a bit.
[01:22:10.040 --> 01:22:15.040]   So anyway, so the point for Facebook is that they already have in the graph stuff.
[01:22:15.040 --> 01:22:19.040]   They already have a sort of their own version of what are all the things in the world that
[01:22:19.040 --> 01:22:20.040]   people talk about.
[01:22:20.040 --> 01:22:25.040]   So I suspect this AI stuff that they're doing is similar to what Google's been doing with
[01:22:25.040 --> 01:22:30.040]   whatever that thing that they call the sidebar cards is to try and make to make sense of
[01:22:30.040 --> 01:22:31.040]   what you're talking about.
[01:22:31.040 --> 01:22:33.040]   But they've got the ability.
[01:22:33.040 --> 01:22:34.040]   And they've been in this for a while.
[01:22:34.040 --> 01:22:38.040]   When you start mentioning something, it'll go, you know, it'll auto-completed.
[01:22:38.040 --> 01:22:40.040]   So you can click it if it's the right one.
[01:22:40.040 --> 01:22:44.040]   So they wouldn't make the, I'm talking to some my friend called Emmy.
[01:22:44.040 --> 01:22:50.040]   I'm talking about the Emmy's thing mistake unless I actually hit return on the wrong
[01:22:50.040 --> 01:22:52.040]   autocomplete there in Facebook.
[01:22:52.040 --> 01:22:59.040]   But if people can't impose a do that, or if people aren't trying to do the equivalent
[01:22:59.040 --> 01:23:03.040]   of an out shout out to somebody, this is going to be one of those things that starts getting
[01:23:03.040 --> 01:23:08.040]   interesting when it starts, it's going to be like Facebook edition photo tagging.
[01:23:08.040 --> 01:23:11.040]   Suddenly you'll find it'll start telling you what these people are mentioning you who
[01:23:11.040 --> 01:23:15.040]   are actually like subtweeting you and trying to snark about you without you realizing
[01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:16.040]   what they're saying.
[01:23:16.040 --> 01:23:21.040]   So that's going to add an extra dimension of trickiness to this game of how do we grumble
[01:23:21.040 --> 01:23:25.040]   about somebody without them realizing the grumbly about them?
[01:23:25.040 --> 01:23:26.040]   Right.
[01:23:26.040 --> 01:23:31.040]   So people will be trying their best to escape Google or Facebook's algorithm for figuring
[01:23:31.040 --> 01:23:32.040]   out who they're talking about.
[01:23:32.040 --> 01:23:34.040]   But actually, Facebook doesn't write.
[01:23:34.040 --> 01:23:37.040]   Sub-tweeting on Facebook won't be possible, right?
[01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:40.040]   Because if their algorithm is good enough, they'll know who you're talking about.
[01:23:40.040 --> 01:23:44.040]   Even if you have an autofill, the linked name.
[01:23:44.040 --> 01:23:51.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:23:51.040 --> 01:23:55.040]   What's the last time you guys went with my Yahoo?
[01:23:55.040 --> 01:23:58.040]   I only use it.
[01:23:58.040 --> 01:24:04.040]   I use it as the example of the silliness, the stupidity of early visions of personalization,
[01:24:04.040 --> 01:24:08.040]   of having to fill out a form to get something you want and how we should be actually just
[01:24:08.040 --> 01:24:09.040]   with those people.
[01:24:09.040 --> 01:24:10.040]   And there it is.
[01:24:10.040 --> 01:24:11.040]   It's just got a new form.
[01:24:11.040 --> 01:24:12.040]   Pretty.
[01:24:12.040 --> 01:24:13.040]   It did.
[01:24:13.040 --> 01:24:17.040]   Yahoo has resurrected my Yahoo.
[01:24:17.040 --> 01:24:19.040]   And it looks a lot like my Yahoo.
[01:24:19.040 --> 01:24:25.040]   It looks like a bunch of widgets that you put on a page, but maybe redesigned a little
[01:24:25.040 --> 01:24:26.040]   better.
[01:24:26.040 --> 01:24:27.040]   That's the old my Yahoo.
[01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:28.040]   And there's the new my Yahoo.
[01:24:28.040 --> 01:24:32.040]   It actually kind of that weather car, that weather widget on the upper left-hand corner
[01:24:32.040 --> 01:24:36.040]   looks a lot like Google now now that I'm looking at it.
[01:24:36.040 --> 01:24:37.040]   Okay.
[01:24:37.040 --> 01:24:38.040]   It didn't ask me to log in.
[01:24:38.040 --> 01:24:40.040]   That's the first time I've been to Yahoo in like three years.
[01:24:40.040 --> 01:24:41.040]   It hasn't asked me to log in.
[01:24:41.040 --> 01:24:45.040]   They've actually remembered that I'm that I have an account and I'm logged in.
[01:24:45.040 --> 01:24:46.040]   That is actually a huge change.
[01:24:46.040 --> 01:24:48.040]   No, you see what you remember this, right?
[01:24:48.040 --> 01:24:51.040]   They used to expire your cookie in like a week or something.
[01:24:51.040 --> 01:24:54.040]   Yes, you tired my account.
[01:24:54.040 --> 01:24:56.040]   You expired my whole account in a year.
[01:24:56.040 --> 01:24:58.040]   Yeah, you have to log in.
[01:24:58.040 --> 01:24:59.040]   Is it once a year?
[01:24:59.040 --> 01:25:00.040]   Yeah, that's.
[01:25:00.040 --> 01:25:01.040]   Yeah.
[01:25:01.040 --> 01:25:03.040]   If you didn't use it, they killed that was the problem.
[01:25:03.040 --> 01:25:05.040]   They killed the council mine.
[01:25:05.040 --> 01:25:12.040]   Yeah, no, they did, but that was my home mail.
[01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:14.040]   They would kill email accounts, yeah.
[01:25:14.040 --> 01:25:15.040]   They would kill not careful.
[01:25:15.040 --> 01:25:16.040]   Marissa would never do that.
[01:25:16.040 --> 01:25:17.040]   I'm sure.
[01:25:17.040 --> 01:25:21.040]   They launched that that launched that service where you could actually request a user name
[01:25:21.040 --> 01:25:22.040]   that you couldn't get.
[01:25:22.040 --> 01:25:23.040]   Yes.
[01:25:23.040 --> 01:25:26.040]   And then if they kill the account of the person with the username,
[01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:30.040]   then you could get it, but then you would start getting email to this, you know,
[01:25:30.040 --> 01:25:32.040]   other person who has account expired.
[01:25:32.040 --> 01:25:34.040]   That story is actually pretty scary.
[01:25:34.040 --> 01:25:35.040]   Yeah, 100.
[01:25:35.040 --> 01:25:40.040]   It's one guy talked about everything he could learn about someone whose old mail is coming
[01:25:40.040 --> 01:25:42.040]   to him, and it's a lot.
[01:25:42.040 --> 01:25:43.040]   It's a lot.
[01:25:43.040 --> 01:25:45.040]   I don't see how you fix that, right?
[01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:46.040]   It's name space.
[01:25:46.040 --> 01:25:51.040]   And once the name has been used, how do you, you can't create a blockade?
[01:25:51.040 --> 01:25:52.040]   Right.
[01:25:52.040 --> 01:25:55.040]   And say only should only deliver mail, you know.
[01:25:55.040 --> 01:25:56.040]   I have that problem anyway.
[01:25:56.040 --> 01:26:00.040]   I mean, I get all these gimos from other Kevin Marxes around the world because I want Kevin
[01:26:00.040 --> 01:26:01.040]   Marx a gmail.
[01:26:01.040 --> 01:26:04.040]   I'm not sure that's, but yeah, they just made it worse.
[01:26:04.040 --> 01:26:07.040]   I think this isn't personalized in any way I can recognize.
[01:26:07.040 --> 01:26:09.040]   It's given me the weather in Minneapolis.
[01:26:09.040 --> 01:26:11.040]   Why do I care?
[01:26:11.040 --> 01:26:13.040]   Oh, have you, have you logged in?
[01:26:13.040 --> 01:26:16.040]   Kevin, it wants to make you feel cocky that you're in much better weather right now.
[01:26:16.040 --> 01:26:18.040]   That's why it's a very California.
[01:26:18.040 --> 01:26:20.040]   It's pretty nice in Minneapolis.
[01:26:20.040 --> 01:26:21.040]   It's 73.
[01:26:21.040 --> 01:26:24.040]   Yeah, I've been in a carvino window.
[01:26:24.040 --> 01:26:26.040]   It's given me San Diego weather.
[01:26:26.040 --> 01:26:28.040]   So actually did no location.
[01:26:28.040 --> 01:26:33.040]   I went there and I'm, you know, I'm logged in, but it's decided I'm in Minneapolis.
[01:26:33.040 --> 01:26:36.040]   And it's telling me stuff about American sports that I have no idea what they even stand for.
[01:26:36.040 --> 01:26:38.040]   What's NCAA?
[01:26:38.040 --> 01:26:39.040]   NCAA.
[01:26:39.040 --> 01:26:41.040]   It's a college basketball.
[01:26:41.040 --> 01:26:42.040]   Even I know that Kevin.
[01:26:42.040 --> 01:26:43.040]   Come on.
[01:26:43.040 --> 01:26:45.040]   Yeah, even I do Kevin.
[01:26:45.040 --> 01:26:46.040]   Okay.
[01:26:46.040 --> 01:26:47.040]   It's like.
[01:26:47.040 --> 01:26:49.040]   I like the, I like the image.
[01:26:49.040 --> 01:26:50.040]   I don't know Chad.
[01:26:50.040 --> 01:26:52.040]   You may have dropped this in the rundown.
[01:26:52.040 --> 01:26:57.040]   A bunch of people on Twitter were saying if Marissa Meyer retweets me, I will, you know,
[01:26:57.040 --> 01:27:01.040]   not making fun of Yahoo's new logo in public and she retweeted them.
[01:27:01.040 --> 01:27:03.040]   And Miss Ryan retweets this.
[01:27:03.040 --> 01:27:05.040]   I will make Yahoo's homepage, my homepage.
[01:27:05.040 --> 01:27:06.040]   And she retweeted it.
[01:27:06.040 --> 01:27:11.040]   So if you go to Marissa Meyer's Twitter, she retweeted a bunch of things of people.
[01:27:11.040 --> 01:27:13.040]   I was like, that's, that's really good.
[01:27:13.040 --> 01:27:14.040]   That's really funny.
[01:27:14.040 --> 01:27:15.040]   Really good.
[01:27:15.040 --> 01:27:20.040]   This is like Google now that has no idea who I am basically, which I suppose is fair enough
[01:27:20.040 --> 01:27:23.040]   as I haven't actually touched you in five days.
[01:27:23.040 --> 01:27:24.040]   You have a relationship with that.
[01:27:24.040 --> 01:27:26.040]   That's why the original vision of giving you.
[01:27:26.040 --> 01:27:28.040]   You know, it is the mix, right?
[01:27:28.040 --> 01:27:30.040]   My newspaper doesn't know where I live or work.
[01:27:30.040 --> 01:27:32.040]   It feeds me the same content.
[01:27:32.040 --> 01:27:35.040]   Even today, it doesn't give me my county versus counties five way.
[01:27:35.040 --> 01:27:36.040]   It's ridiculous.
[01:27:36.040 --> 01:27:37.040]   They target ads.
[01:27:37.040 --> 01:27:38.040]   They don't target content.
[01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:40.040]   So we should have learned this lesson from Yahoo years ago.
[01:27:40.040 --> 01:27:44.040]   The problem for Yahoo at the time, of course, was that it had to be explicit.
[01:27:44.040 --> 01:27:45.040]   The instruction to it.
[01:27:45.040 --> 01:27:48.040]   And we all filled it out and never, never went back to it.
[01:27:48.040 --> 01:27:55.040]   If sites just operated this way by implicitly gaining information about us, like, you know,
[01:27:55.040 --> 01:27:58.040]   Google does because we have so much of a relationship with them.
[01:27:58.040 --> 01:28:01.040]   Then the Yahoo structure is fine.
[01:28:01.040 --> 01:28:06.040]   But it's all that's wrong about it is the form to fill in.
[01:28:06.040 --> 01:28:07.040]   Agreed.
[01:28:07.040 --> 01:28:08.040]   Agreed.
[01:28:08.040 --> 01:28:09.040]   Well, yeah.
[01:28:09.040 --> 01:28:11.040]   The question is how you feel it used to information.
[01:28:11.040 --> 01:28:15.040]   Teepy, do you give me enough reasons to use you like Google?
[01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:17.040]   Then you're going to learn a lot about me.
[01:28:17.040 --> 01:28:18.040]   That's true.
[01:28:18.040 --> 01:28:19.040]   Yeah.
[01:28:19.040 --> 01:28:20.040]   Right.
[01:28:20.040 --> 01:28:22.040]   And that's really what Meyer has to do.
[01:28:22.040 --> 01:28:26.040]   The thing that Yahoo has done previously is they've let you log in with Google and with
[01:28:26.040 --> 01:28:27.040]   Facebook.
[01:28:27.040 --> 01:28:31.040]   So potentially that would mean that they could, if they could do an OOR thing and get some
[01:28:31.040 --> 01:28:32.040]   more info and feed it into this.
[01:28:32.040 --> 01:28:34.040]   So that would make a bit more sense.
[01:28:34.040 --> 01:28:40.040]   Certainly in the past, Yahoo has spent a chunk of time trying to make some of this ID integration
[01:28:40.040 --> 01:28:41.040]   stuff work.
[01:28:41.040 --> 01:28:45.040]   So it may just be because I've got a really old account that I basically keep because it's
[01:28:45.040 --> 01:28:46.040]   my flicker login.
[01:28:46.040 --> 01:28:51.040]   I'm just getting not much of anything because I'm not feeding them enough info.
[01:28:51.040 --> 01:28:52.040]   Yeah.
[01:28:52.040 --> 01:28:57.040]   I mean, I actually use flicker quite a bit mostly to share photos with my family because I
[01:28:57.040 --> 01:28:59.040]   owe the baby.
[01:28:59.040 --> 01:29:00.040]   That's really the only time.
[01:29:00.040 --> 01:29:04.040]   I should log into my Yahoo mail because I don't want to lose my account.
[01:29:04.040 --> 01:29:12.040]   So you referenced this earlier, Jeff, a bomber calls Google a monopoly.
[01:29:12.040 --> 01:29:15.040]   I sort of love that the bummer sort of --
[01:29:15.040 --> 01:29:16.040]   The authority should control.
[01:29:16.040 --> 01:29:17.040]   Yeah.
[01:29:17.040 --> 01:29:18.040]   The authority should control.
[01:29:18.040 --> 01:29:20.040]   But you know, I got to tell you, I read the article.
[01:29:20.040 --> 01:29:22.040]   I don't -- this is on the verge.
[01:29:22.040 --> 01:29:26.040]   I don't see the part -- and I don't see the quote where he says that authority should
[01:29:26.040 --> 01:29:27.040]   control.
[01:29:27.040 --> 01:29:31.480]   I think that he said that he said I do believe that Google's practices are worthy of discussion
[01:29:31.480 --> 01:29:33.400]   with competition authority.
[01:29:33.400 --> 01:29:35.800]   We have certainly discussed them with competition authority.
[01:29:35.800 --> 01:29:36.800]   So I guess --
[01:29:36.800 --> 01:29:37.800]   Yeah, that's the point.
[01:29:37.800 --> 01:29:39.800]   He thinks that they should control.
[01:29:39.800 --> 01:29:41.320]   Well, they first do this all the time.
[01:29:41.320 --> 01:29:46.640]   They've got a whole bunch of front organizations that go up and lobby, you know, Congress to
[01:29:46.640 --> 01:29:50.640]   say Google is a terrible monopoly and should be regulated and cookies should be banned
[01:29:50.640 --> 01:29:56.640]   and do not track, should exist and, you know, whatever they feel like.
[01:29:56.640 --> 01:30:02.280]   Oh, it's a terrible thing to sue people for certain kinds of patents but other kinds
[01:30:02.280 --> 01:30:05.960]   of patents depending on whether you're the kind of Microsoft is suing Google over or
[01:30:05.960 --> 01:30:06.960]   not.
[01:30:06.960 --> 01:30:11.280]   You know, there's a whole pile of like sketchy crap that the Microsoft get up to in this
[01:30:11.280 --> 01:30:12.280]   arena.
[01:30:12.280 --> 01:30:13.280]   Yeah.
[01:30:13.280 --> 01:30:17.280]   Have their share of doing slightly annoying things too but Microsoft have a real track
[01:30:17.280 --> 01:30:21.120]   record of being complete dicks about this.
[01:30:21.120 --> 01:30:22.960]   Oh, of course, of course.
[01:30:22.960 --> 01:30:25.920]   But what I thought was interesting is that bomber was sort of self-congratulating Microsoft
[01:30:25.920 --> 01:30:29.840]   for being the only people who are trying to compete with Google.
[01:30:29.840 --> 01:30:34.760]   So asked by an analyst how Microsoft can attack Google's dominance and search and advertising.
[01:30:34.760 --> 01:30:38.000]   Bomber explained we're the only guys in the world trying with the day.
[01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:41.360]   So this doesn't mean much about China and Russia then, does he?
[01:30:41.360 --> 01:30:43.360]   He does.
[01:30:43.360 --> 01:30:44.360]   He does.
[01:30:44.360 --> 01:30:45.360]   Should be.
[01:30:45.360 --> 01:30:47.760]   Yeah, it's a very good point.
[01:30:47.760 --> 01:30:51.600]   But should we be worried that no one's trying to build search engines anymore?
[01:30:51.600 --> 01:30:54.400]   I mean, has Google basically just buttoned up?
[01:30:54.400 --> 01:30:58.360]   Do people not care about search anymore because Google's buttoned up and now it's all about
[01:30:58.360 --> 01:30:59.360]   social?
[01:30:59.360 --> 01:31:02.160]   Why do you think search is ready for that?
[01:31:02.160 --> 01:31:04.720]   Yeah, you think search is a different kind of search.
[01:31:04.720 --> 01:31:10.000]   That goes back to the Gladford Thompson point of, do you know what category of things that
[01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:12.880]   you can find on Google and there's another category of things that you would look somewhere
[01:31:12.880 --> 01:31:13.880]   else for?
[01:31:13.880 --> 01:31:14.880]   And that's what we're starting to see.
[01:31:14.880 --> 01:31:17.240]   So with people, there's a kind of question you would ask Twitter that you wouldn't ask
[01:31:17.240 --> 01:31:18.240]   Google.
[01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:20.360]   There's a kind of question you would ask for Square that you wouldn't ask Google.
[01:31:20.360 --> 01:31:23.560]   And when you're asking Twitter, you're not really asking Twitter, you're asking the people
[01:31:23.560 --> 01:31:24.760]   that are following you on Twitter.
[01:31:24.760 --> 01:31:25.760]   Yes, people who are following you.
[01:31:25.760 --> 01:31:26.760]   Yeah.
[01:31:26.760 --> 01:31:27.760]   Yeah.
[01:31:27.760 --> 01:31:29.760]   But I got to say, I run, see with Google Reader, I was like, yeah, I don't really use an RSS
[01:31:29.760 --> 01:31:30.760]   reader anymore.
[01:31:30.760 --> 01:31:35.520]   I do easily a dozen web searches a day on Google.
[01:31:35.520 --> 01:31:37.360]   And I switched to DuckDuckGo for a while.
[01:31:37.360 --> 01:31:42.440]   But DuckDuckGo was, I think it was a Bing on the back end or it was other search engines
[01:31:42.440 --> 01:31:43.440]   kind of on the back end.
[01:31:43.440 --> 01:31:48.080]   Oh, so I think, oh, so you come back, have you, you follow the white children?
[01:31:48.080 --> 01:31:53.000]   Well, I mean, honestly, with my, I do a lot of my searching on my Android device and,
[01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:56.400]   you know, that Google search bar is sort of a fixed-year home screen and it's not easy
[01:31:56.400 --> 01:32:00.720]   to change to another search engine unless you're running CyanogenMod, interestingly.
[01:32:00.720 --> 01:32:05.080]   But you know, between now and, you know, a lot, yes, a lot of my searches are Google
[01:32:05.080 --> 01:32:06.080]   powered.
[01:32:06.080 --> 01:32:10.800]   I had changed my search shortcut to DuckDuckGo, but I sometimes will switch over to Google
[01:32:10.800 --> 01:32:13.360]   or type in the Google, you know, bank away.
[01:32:13.360 --> 01:32:14.360]   Could you trip in?
[01:32:14.360 --> 01:32:15.360]   Yeah.
[01:32:15.360 --> 01:32:17.400]   Well, look, Google's good at search.
[01:32:17.400 --> 01:32:19.800]   I know that breaking news, Google's good at search.
[01:32:19.800 --> 01:32:26.960]   I was ashamed of you for doubting God Google and now you have returned to the phone.
[01:32:26.960 --> 01:32:27.960]   I like choice.
[01:32:27.960 --> 01:32:28.960]   I like competition.
[01:32:28.960 --> 01:32:32.800]   And it did occur to me reading this bomber quote like, you know, there really isn't another
[01:32:32.800 --> 01:32:37.320]   US company attempting to attempt thing search the way that, I mean, Microsoft is trying
[01:32:37.320 --> 01:32:39.160]   to do search with Bing.
[01:32:39.160 --> 01:32:40.560]   Real competition would be good.
[01:32:40.560 --> 01:32:44.880]   The problem is that Microsoft is trying to catch up to Google and to really rethink search
[01:32:44.880 --> 01:32:46.160]   in some fundamental ways.
[01:32:46.160 --> 01:32:47.960]   I think we're due for that.
[01:32:47.960 --> 01:32:48.960]   Right.
[01:32:48.960 --> 01:32:52.680]   And Google, which loves to give us relevance and has added in things that are personal.
[01:32:52.680 --> 01:32:53.680]   I think it's important.
[01:32:53.680 --> 01:32:58.440]   They've certainly advanced search by quietly, by many leaps.
[01:32:58.440 --> 01:33:00.600]   But there's probably some great inspiration out there.
[01:33:00.600 --> 01:33:04.360]   And I think it's a really bright, you know, Larry Page of the next generation to rethink
[01:33:04.360 --> 01:33:06.960]   it again and cause competition, which would be a wonderful thing.
[01:33:06.960 --> 01:33:07.960]   Right.
[01:33:07.960 --> 01:33:10.960]   The new page rank, the page rank of the new new generation.
[01:33:10.960 --> 01:33:11.960]   Yes.
[01:33:11.960 --> 01:33:12.960]   It's not.
[01:33:12.960 --> 01:33:17.080]   I mean, Facebook had something with graph search, but that's still not like that.
[01:33:17.080 --> 01:33:19.960]   Graph search still feels like I'm asking my friends versus I'm going to the library.
[01:33:19.960 --> 01:33:20.960]   Go ahead.
[01:33:20.960 --> 01:33:22.440]   I'm going to find your friends.
[01:33:22.440 --> 01:33:27.400]   I mean, that's the point of graph, actually, say I want to find like, you know, people
[01:33:27.400 --> 01:33:33.480]   I know in a certain country or whatever, you know, things like it's finding something
[01:33:33.480 --> 01:33:36.720]   that you would then go and look at something else for something else of that.
[01:33:36.720 --> 01:33:41.440]   But there's places where you would say, okay, I want to search Yelp or I want to search
[01:33:41.440 --> 01:33:44.280]   for Square because I want to go out for dinner and I don't trust Google's reviews yet and
[01:33:44.280 --> 01:33:45.400]   Google are trying to fix that.
[01:33:45.400 --> 01:33:49.880]   But you pick one of those over that.
[01:33:49.880 --> 01:33:53.160]   And then there are the much more subtle things where you're saying, okay, no, actually, I
[01:33:53.160 --> 01:33:55.080]   do want to talk to a subset of people.
[01:33:55.080 --> 01:33:57.120]   I didn't want to talk to the entire universe.
[01:33:57.120 --> 01:33:59.480]   And to some extent, that is the difference between four square and Yelp.
[01:33:59.480 --> 01:34:02.400]   Yelp is like, okay, give me a bunch of opinions.
[01:34:02.400 --> 01:34:05.200]   I don't care about about places near me.
[01:34:05.200 --> 01:34:11.120]   And four square is give me a list of people I know where they've eaten recently and justify
[01:34:11.120 --> 01:34:12.120]   that.
[01:34:12.120 --> 01:34:16.720]   So I think part of what we'll get is, is that the thing that forecasters beautifully is
[01:34:16.720 --> 01:34:19.280]   the, it tells you why it's recommending that place.
[01:34:19.280 --> 01:34:26.120]   It gives you anything underneath that says, your friend, your friend, Jeff went there and
[01:34:26.120 --> 01:34:28.160]   he thinks that the clinicians are really good.
[01:34:28.160 --> 01:34:31.200]   So if I'm in New York or something like that, that'll be handy.
[01:34:31.200 --> 01:34:36.040]   Or it says, your friend, Fred went there and you're like, well, Fred, I always eat scrap.
[01:34:36.040 --> 01:34:38.960]   I don't want to go take his recommendations.
[01:34:38.960 --> 01:34:43.920]   Or it says, it gives you like a little bit of justification for why it's in the search
[01:34:43.920 --> 01:34:45.360]   results, whereas Google doesn't really do that.
[01:34:45.360 --> 01:34:46.560]   It'll give you like a list of things.
[01:34:46.560 --> 01:34:48.440]   You're like, well, okay, that's kind of what I was thinking.
[01:34:48.440 --> 01:34:51.120]   But why would I care?
[01:34:51.120 --> 01:34:53.000]   Yeah, it's true.
[01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:54.000]   It's true.
[01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:55.000]   And it's extremely powerful.
[01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.720]   I go to a restaurant and I see that five of my friends have been there.
[01:34:57.720 --> 01:35:01.760]   I'm much more likely to go there than a place that hasn't.
[01:35:01.760 --> 01:35:02.760]   And that's absolutely true.
[01:35:02.760 --> 01:35:03.760]   Well, that's four square.
[01:35:03.760 --> 01:35:04.760]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:35:04.760 --> 01:35:05.760]   It's only four square, yeah, yeah.
[01:35:05.760 --> 01:35:06.760]   And that's four square, yeah.
[01:35:06.760 --> 01:35:08.360]   But like I think about the things I search for.
[01:35:08.360 --> 01:35:13.520]   So, you know, I code my day job and I'm not doing the shows and, you know, I off, I'm
[01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:15.120]   on Stack Overflow all the time.
[01:35:15.120 --> 01:35:16.120]   I'm googling errors.
[01:35:16.120 --> 01:35:18.200]   I'm looking up code or whatever.
[01:35:18.200 --> 01:35:20.680]   I never go to Stack Overflow and search Stack Overflow.
[01:35:20.680 --> 01:35:23.920]   I always Google it and Stack Overflow just has great Google.
[01:35:23.920 --> 01:35:27.600]   And it's often Stack that comes up and I'm like, oh, yeah, I recognize that Stack that's
[01:35:27.600 --> 01:35:29.600]   definitely going to be, you know, what I need.
[01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:33.280]   So I'm still kind of, and I guess this is kind of the equivalent of typing, you know,
[01:35:33.280 --> 01:35:36.120]   Facebook into the Google search box in order to get to Facebook.
[01:35:36.120 --> 01:35:37.840]   It doesn't really make sense.
[01:35:37.840 --> 01:35:41.360]   But it is Google really is kind of this initial gateway into all the different places.
[01:35:41.360 --> 01:35:42.360]   I mean, I love four square.
[01:35:42.360 --> 01:35:43.360]   I love Yelp.
[01:35:43.360 --> 01:35:44.360]   I love Stack.
[01:35:44.360 --> 01:35:48.280]   I search the PHP documentation all the time, you know, I, or the Java doc or the Android doc.
[01:35:48.280 --> 01:35:50.440]   But I never, I don't, I don't know those URLs off the top.
[01:35:50.440 --> 01:35:52.920]   I just, I search from Google and go from there.
[01:35:52.920 --> 01:35:53.920]   Yeah.
[01:35:53.920 --> 01:35:58.840]   I mean, so you say about one of the things that, that I lost when they killed reader was that
[01:35:58.840 --> 01:36:03.160]   reader had that search bar that would search all the things you'd subscribe to, which was
[01:36:03.160 --> 01:36:04.160]   really, really nice.
[01:36:04.160 --> 01:36:07.480]   It was like constrained the search to things that you've already gone buying your feed.
[01:36:07.480 --> 01:36:09.280]   And I found that really handy.
[01:36:09.280 --> 01:36:10.920]   That is very powerful.
[01:36:10.920 --> 01:36:11.920]   And that's a piece, you know, that's a piece.
[01:36:11.920 --> 01:36:13.920]   We're back to the reader morning.
[01:36:13.920 --> 01:36:16.640]   No, no, but the point is it's search over history.
[01:36:16.640 --> 01:36:17.640]   It's search over my history.
[01:36:17.640 --> 01:36:21.320]   It's a bunch of stuff that I've read over the last seven years.
[01:36:21.320 --> 01:36:22.920]   And I vaguely remember reading a thing.
[01:36:22.920 --> 01:36:25.160]   It's like I was saying about the Amazon thing.
[01:36:25.160 --> 01:36:27.960]   I vaguely remember reading a thing about that.
[01:36:27.960 --> 01:36:30.120]   Give me some, give me some direction here.
[01:36:30.120 --> 01:36:32.000]   Because if I search the entire way, I won't find it.
[01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.640]   But I want to constrain the set of things that I've seen.
[01:36:34.640 --> 01:36:39.440]   And Google throwing away the list of stuff that I've seen in that particular space is,
[01:36:39.440 --> 01:36:41.000]   is short-sighted.
[01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:44.760]   That, you know, rather than it saying, okay, how do we expand that experience to a bunch
[01:36:44.760 --> 01:36:49.240]   of other people rather than just this, that's, you know, that's what they're missing.
[01:36:49.240 --> 01:36:54.600]   I think Facebook and Twitter, having those long attitudinal histories of stuff we've
[01:36:54.600 --> 01:36:58.880]   looked at, will be, will be, have a better chance of that unless people can really get
[01:36:58.880 --> 01:37:00.880]   all of us using, using Plus.
[01:37:00.880 --> 01:37:05.160]   Yeah, I mean, it's, it's, it's, it's a close equivalent to Amazon, you know, deleting
[01:37:05.160 --> 01:37:09.680]   your son's notes and highlights from, from all his books because of the account, the
[01:37:09.680 --> 01:37:10.680]   account mix up.
[01:37:10.680 --> 01:37:11.680]   And it's similar to that.
[01:37:11.680 --> 01:37:15.000]   No, I think, you know, I've exported them, whatever.
[01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:18.720]   But I don't, I don't think when I exported it, I got all the articles I'd read, right?
[01:37:18.720 --> 01:37:19.720]   Right.
[01:37:19.720 --> 01:37:21.720]   I just got, you know, where is that?
[01:37:21.720 --> 01:37:22.720]   The stuff you liked and shared.
[01:37:22.720 --> 01:37:25.680]   And database, was that database was there and it was searchable and it was actually really
[01:37:25.680 --> 01:37:26.680]   useful.
[01:37:26.680 --> 01:37:27.680]   Yeah.
[01:37:27.680 --> 01:37:31.480]   Because they had the database of all the blog posts that I'd read ever.
[01:37:31.480 --> 01:37:32.480]   Yep.
[01:37:32.480 --> 01:37:33.480]   Hmm.
[01:37:33.480 --> 01:37:40.160]   So are there any other, other stories that we should hit before we move on to our, uh,
[01:37:40.160 --> 01:37:41.160]   Good job.
[01:37:41.160 --> 01:37:45.440]   Uh, I think you got us through really good stuff.
[01:37:45.440 --> 01:37:46.440]   Without the technical.
[01:37:46.440 --> 01:37:49.040]   I do have to mention one thing, of course.
[01:37:49.040 --> 01:37:50.040]   Yes.
[01:37:50.040 --> 01:37:55.200]   It's still not connected.
[01:37:55.200 --> 01:38:02.960]   Six or three days after the Nexus seven was announced, 16 days after it went on sale.
[01:38:02.960 --> 01:38:05.160]   It's still not connected.
[01:38:05.160 --> 01:38:08.920]   Bob, because from Verizon, they're not saying crap all up.
[01:38:08.920 --> 01:38:13.520]   I've gone to the FCC as you know, last week, Verizon, oh, I guess it's the nuisance last
[01:38:13.520 --> 01:38:14.520]   week for.
[01:38:14.520 --> 01:38:18.280]   I'm going to say, oh, we have to certify, but I still say that's not openness.
[01:38:18.280 --> 01:38:21.160]   That's not just putting device on the way you can do all across Europe.
[01:38:21.160 --> 01:38:22.560]   So I responded to the FCC.
[01:38:22.560 --> 01:38:25.200]   I'm going to keep back for the FCC on this.
[01:38:25.200 --> 01:38:28.800]   I remain enraged and people keep on saying to me, well, I should just take the sim out
[01:38:28.800 --> 01:38:33.200]   of your, um, pixel and then go take the store and get no sim in there.
[01:38:33.200 --> 01:38:34.200]   Because it's a matter of principle.
[01:38:34.200 --> 01:38:35.200]   I'm fighting for you people.
[01:38:35.200 --> 01:38:36.200]   I'm fighting.
[01:38:36.200 --> 01:38:38.800]   No, this is this is this is the nerd answer.
[01:38:38.800 --> 01:38:39.800]   Right?
[01:38:39.800 --> 01:38:42.480]   We, I think this was like episode three where you were, you were talking about something and
[01:38:42.480 --> 01:38:44.040]   you said, Gene, are you bothered by this?
[01:38:44.040 --> 01:38:46.680]   I was like, no, because I'll be able to find a technical work around, right?
[01:38:46.680 --> 01:38:51.120]   We just, we just really short sided views over them to say, Hey man, just take out the
[01:38:51.120 --> 01:38:52.120]   sim.
[01:38:52.120 --> 01:38:53.120]   You use the team all but what's the big deal?
[01:38:53.120 --> 01:38:54.120]   Right.
[01:38:54.120 --> 01:38:55.120]   You're, you're, this is, this is the flaw.
[01:38:55.120 --> 01:38:56.120]   This is a matter of principle.
[01:38:56.120 --> 01:38:57.280]   You're fighting the good fight.
[01:38:57.280 --> 01:39:02.960]   So, so has Verizon given a day, an estimated day, or they just say soon?
[01:39:02.960 --> 01:39:03.960]   So I know what's going to happen.
[01:39:03.960 --> 01:39:05.160]   I really don't understand their end game.
[01:39:05.160 --> 01:39:08.960]   I really honestly don't because at some point they're going to have to approve this.
[01:39:08.960 --> 01:39:10.440]   It's obviously certified.
[01:39:10.440 --> 01:39:14.480]   If they, if they don't, then that, that kills the notion of openness because it operates
[01:39:14.480 --> 01:39:18.280]   all around the world, including its competitors, AT&T, T-Mobile.
[01:39:18.280 --> 01:39:20.120]   That's why there should be no certification.
[01:39:20.120 --> 01:39:24.880]   What we need here is a clarification from the FCC of the rules because certification and
[01:39:24.880 --> 01:39:26.640]   openness don't match.
[01:39:26.640 --> 01:39:31.360]   If it's open, that means you can take any device that's been certified by the FCC that
[01:39:31.360 --> 01:39:35.360]   works on networks and put a sim in it and it should work automatically the way it does
[01:39:35.360 --> 01:39:41.280]   on AT&T, T-Mobile, and all across Europe and the rest of the world.
[01:39:41.280 --> 01:39:48.520]   And so the FCC rules are going to have to be clarified, thus changed to say no, Verizon,
[01:39:48.520 --> 01:39:51.040]   this is what openness means.
[01:39:51.040 --> 01:39:53.080]   O-P-E-N, right?
[01:39:53.080 --> 01:39:56.080]   It's like Bill Clinton talking about the definition of is.
[01:39:56.080 --> 01:39:58.120]   They got to figure this out.
[01:39:58.120 --> 01:39:59.920]   So I just want to give the update here.
[01:39:59.920 --> 01:40:04.200]   I'm going to continue fighting the good fight people.
[01:40:04.200 --> 01:40:05.200]   Thank you, Jeff.
[01:40:05.200 --> 01:40:06.200]   You're welcome, Jeff.
[01:40:06.200 --> 01:40:07.200]   We appreciate it.
[01:40:07.200 --> 01:40:16.320]   I think we may have a word from Kevin that didn't mean to cut you off.
[01:40:16.320 --> 01:40:17.320]   Sorry, sorry.
[01:40:17.320 --> 01:40:20.400]   It just reminded me, because having done the trip to the UK for two weeks and spending
[01:40:20.400 --> 01:40:26.040]   a lot of time moving sims around, that was the experience there was fascinating because
[01:40:26.040 --> 01:40:33.320]   you can forget a sim for, you know, they're at the counter in the convenience store.
[01:40:33.320 --> 01:40:35.120]   You can recharge them anywhere.
[01:40:35.120 --> 01:40:38.040]   You can buy cigarettes or chocolate.
[01:40:38.040 --> 01:40:42.840]   You can get a new sim for a different provider, similarly anywhere there.
[01:40:42.840 --> 01:40:45.960]   All the phones are presumably presumed to be unlocked.
[01:40:45.960 --> 01:40:50.520]   If they aren't unlocked, the official phone shop will say there's a guy in the corner
[01:40:50.520 --> 01:40:54.240]   just going to talk to him and he will download a hack from the net and exploit your phone
[01:40:54.240 --> 01:40:57.160]   and lock it for you.
[01:40:57.160 --> 01:41:01.920]   But they actually are pushing really hard to censor the net.
[01:41:01.920 --> 01:41:11.840]   And even the Guardian published some rotten survey by a filtering company that says 50%
[01:41:11.840 --> 01:41:17.160]   of this terrible, almost 50% of Wi-Fi things aren't filtered.
[01:41:17.160 --> 01:41:20.080]   It's like Jesus Christ, 50% of them are filtered.
[01:41:20.080 --> 01:41:21.080]   That's horrific.
[01:41:21.080 --> 01:41:26.840]   I did find that there is this strange culture of, no, we must censor the net to protect the
[01:41:26.840 --> 01:41:29.360]   British public from it.
[01:41:29.360 --> 01:41:34.800]   I did find that when I was using Wi-Fi places, some of them were blocking SSH and IRC and
[01:41:34.800 --> 01:41:37.320]   things and VPNs.
[01:41:37.320 --> 01:41:42.400]   So there is a, you know, they have an openness on one layer and then they have this sort
[01:41:42.400 --> 01:41:47.560]   of weird, like, as you say, lacking a first amendment, censorship, thinking on that.
[01:41:47.560 --> 01:41:49.520]   And certain sites do not show up at all.
[01:41:49.520 --> 01:41:51.520]   If you go to...
[01:41:51.520 --> 01:41:52.520]   That's appalling.
[01:41:52.520 --> 01:41:56.680]   If you go to Pirate Bay in the UK, then you get a...
[01:41:56.680 --> 01:42:00.880]   I'm sorry, we've been told by the company, you can't see this page on many of the ISPs.
[01:42:00.880 --> 01:42:03.720]   And the GCHQ is coming after you right now.
[01:42:03.720 --> 01:42:05.480]   Just stay there, sir.
[01:42:05.480 --> 01:42:06.720]   They'll be there soon.
[01:42:06.720 --> 01:42:07.720]   Still, yes.
[01:42:07.720 --> 01:42:10.720]   I think they're going to blow up your machine.
[01:42:10.720 --> 01:42:14.320]   Oh, speaking of which, speaking of which, Chad, would you mind just going to my Google
[01:42:14.320 --> 01:42:18.520]   Plus feed and look for the photo of Alan Rusperger there?
[01:42:18.520 --> 01:42:22.760]   Rusperger spoke in New York last week and this is the editor of the Guardian.
[01:42:22.760 --> 01:42:30.440]   And as you remember, folks, the GCHQ, the NSA of the UK, how's that for a lot of initials,
[01:42:30.440 --> 01:42:33.600]   came in and destroyed Guardian laptops.
[01:42:33.600 --> 01:42:37.560]   Even though Rusperger said straight out, this data from Edward Snowden is elsewhere.
[01:42:37.560 --> 01:42:38.920]   It's at the New York Times.
[01:42:38.920 --> 01:42:39.920]   It's in Brazil.
[01:42:39.920 --> 01:42:42.120]   This is really rather absurd.
[01:42:42.120 --> 01:42:44.520]   But they destroyed it.
[01:42:44.520 --> 01:42:45.640]   So Rusperger was a great woman.
[01:42:45.640 --> 01:42:49.640]   He brought along a little, I think it was probably a...
[01:42:49.640 --> 01:42:50.640]   There it is.
[01:42:50.640 --> 01:42:55.400]   And all the best-dressed editors were, there is a piece of the computer.
[01:42:55.400 --> 01:42:59.800]   And it's amazing how close you can see the grill marks going over and over and over again.
[01:42:59.800 --> 01:43:02.360]   They went berserk to destroy it.
[01:43:02.360 --> 01:43:04.360]   Absolutely berserk.
[01:43:04.360 --> 01:43:05.360]   Wow.
[01:43:05.360 --> 01:43:09.200]   That's what was left of the Guardian computer that pieces like that.
[01:43:09.200 --> 01:43:10.200]   Destroyed computers.
[01:43:10.200 --> 01:43:13.160]   Did he make it a lapel clip or is he just holding it up?
[01:43:13.160 --> 01:43:14.640]   No, no, he was joking.
[01:43:14.640 --> 01:43:16.160]   We were joking that he ought to.
[01:43:16.160 --> 01:43:17.160]   Yes.
[01:43:17.160 --> 01:43:18.960]   That's the way to put it there.
[01:43:18.960 --> 01:43:19.960]   He's a pangivano.
[01:43:19.960 --> 01:43:21.560]   He should be wearing it like I have a face.
[01:43:21.560 --> 01:43:22.560]   He should be wearing it.
[01:43:22.560 --> 01:43:24.360]   There'd be some good jewelry right there.
[01:43:24.360 --> 01:43:25.360]   Wow.
[01:43:25.360 --> 01:43:26.360]   There is a helmet.
[01:43:26.360 --> 01:43:28.360]   That's the more stern, Alan.
[01:43:28.360 --> 01:43:32.280]   There's something called Alan Rusperger.
[01:43:32.280 --> 01:43:34.640]   Go ahead and put his name in there.
[01:43:34.640 --> 01:43:35.640]   Chad, yes.
[01:43:35.640 --> 01:43:38.280]   Oh, it's a prompt thing for the name tag.
[01:43:38.280 --> 01:43:39.640]   Yeah, it's true.
[01:43:39.640 --> 01:43:40.640]   Sorry.
[01:43:40.640 --> 01:43:41.640]   Sorry.
[01:43:41.640 --> 01:43:42.640]   Sorry.
[01:43:42.640 --> 01:43:43.640]   Okay.
[01:43:43.640 --> 01:43:46.480]   So I think we're saying...
[01:43:46.480 --> 01:43:51.680]   We might have a word from our sponsor, via Leo, disembodied Leo from vacation.
[01:43:51.680 --> 01:43:53.160]   Hey, everybody.
[01:43:53.160 --> 01:43:55.560]   Sorry I couldn't be here for twig, but I am here for the ad.
[01:43:55.560 --> 01:43:56.560]   How about that, huh?
[01:43:56.560 --> 01:43:58.600]   Gina, you're doing a great job.
[01:43:58.600 --> 01:43:59.600]   You're beautiful, kid.
[01:43:59.600 --> 01:44:04.800]   Don't ever change the show brought to you by our friends at hover.com.
[01:44:04.800 --> 01:44:09.000]   Actually, I love coming back to talk about hover because I, first of all, Elliot Noss and
[01:44:09.000 --> 01:44:12.920]   his crew at Took House are great guys, great people.
[01:44:12.920 --> 01:44:18.240]   And one of the things that they're really about is taking businesses, industries, and
[01:44:18.240 --> 01:44:19.720]   making them work better.
[01:44:19.720 --> 01:44:24.520]   And solutions, companies that are just are broken, like the cell phone industry with Ting
[01:44:24.520 --> 01:44:28.880]   and the domain name registration industry with hover.com.
[01:44:28.880 --> 01:44:32.680]   Hover is the best domain name registrar of all.
[01:44:32.680 --> 01:44:35.120]   I use it all the time now.
[01:44:35.120 --> 01:44:38.760]   When I first started using hover, I used their concierge service, got all my domains
[01:44:38.760 --> 01:44:39.760]   moved over.
[01:44:39.760 --> 01:44:40.760]   Couldn't have been easier.
[01:44:40.760 --> 01:44:43.480]   In fact, I highly recommend that.
[01:44:43.480 --> 01:44:50.180]   Now they offer, besides easy, simple to use domain name registration, very, very nice
[01:44:50.180 --> 01:44:55.080]   domain management tools, friction-free purchases.
[01:44:55.080 --> 01:44:57.440]   They also offer Google Apps.
[01:44:57.440 --> 01:44:58.520]   So this is kind of cool.
[01:44:58.520 --> 01:45:04.720]   Now for your business or even from your family or for your group, Google Apps will be a
[01:45:04.720 --> 01:45:08.080]   Google Apps office, a full-piece Google Apps here.
[01:45:08.080 --> 01:45:09.560]   And you can sit it all up through hover.com.
[01:45:09.560 --> 01:45:12.960]   So get a domain name that'll be your Google App domain.
[01:45:12.960 --> 01:45:16.480]   You have this, you can try it for 30 days free.
[01:45:16.480 --> 01:45:21.640]   You'll get Google Mail, Google Calendar, Google Drive, Google Docs, the whole package.
[01:45:21.640 --> 01:45:23.080]   You could use it on an existing domain.
[01:45:23.080 --> 01:45:24.080]   They can help you do that.
[01:45:24.080 --> 01:45:28.520]   But you know, because they have the LaPorte family Google App domain, you know, LaPorte
[01:45:28.520 --> 01:45:30.680]   family or whatever.
[01:45:30.680 --> 01:45:34.640]   I wish I had thought of this actually before I sent the kids off to college.
[01:45:34.640 --> 01:45:37.280]   You get 25 gigs of storage, of course, on Gmail.
[01:45:37.280 --> 01:45:42.200]   And it's easy to collaborate with file sharing and chatting.
[01:45:42.200 --> 01:45:46.320]   Google, maybe not, we talked about this the other day, not the easiest company to get
[01:45:46.320 --> 01:45:49.960]   a hold of for support.
[01:45:49.960 --> 01:45:51.280]   But this is what's great about it.
[01:45:51.280 --> 01:45:55.240]   You'll get the outstanding support of Hover, the no-hold support of Hover, best in the
[01:45:55.240 --> 01:45:57.000]   industry, and Google Apps.
[01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.760]   So it's a great combination.
[01:45:59.760 --> 01:46:00.760]   I want you to try Hover.
[01:46:00.760 --> 01:46:01.760]   So here's the deal.
[01:46:01.760 --> 01:46:06.000]   If you visit Hover.com, you can try it out by pick a domain name.
[01:46:06.000 --> 01:46:08.120]   You know, something you're thinking of buying.
[01:46:08.120 --> 01:46:13.240]   They offer all the big domain names.com.net.org.tv.pro.moby.biz.
[01:46:13.240 --> 01:46:16.720]   They have .io, which is a fun one.
[01:46:16.720 --> 01:46:21.320]   Countrycoats too, like .ca.asia.us.uk.
[01:46:21.320 --> 01:46:24.680]   If you go in there and you enter a name and you don't be disappointed if the .com's not
[01:46:24.680 --> 01:46:26.520]   there pretty commonly, it's not.
[01:46:26.520 --> 01:46:31.800]   They do recommend an iegrate.net is a great choice.
[01:46:31.800 --> 01:46:32.800]   People understand .net.
[01:46:32.800 --> 01:46:35.360]   It's kind of the next best thing to .com.
[01:46:35.360 --> 01:46:37.880]   But they'll offer you all the different choices and you can see what you like.
[01:46:37.880 --> 01:46:39.640]   I would look at .net.
[01:46:39.640 --> 01:46:44.200]   Hover offers excellent online help, great support documentation, tutorials, everything
[01:46:44.200 --> 01:46:45.200]   you need.
[01:46:45.200 --> 01:46:49.000]   And again, that no-hold, no-weight, no-transfer phone support is fabulous.
[01:46:49.000 --> 01:46:52.400]   When you call during regular business hours, you're going to talk to a live agent who's
[01:46:52.400 --> 01:46:54.280]   empowered and eager to help.
[01:46:54.280 --> 01:46:55.280]   Hover.
[01:46:55.280 --> 01:46:56.280]   You want to try it?
[01:46:56.280 --> 01:46:57.280]   Here we go.
[01:46:57.280 --> 01:46:58.280]   Here's the deal.
[01:46:58.280 --> 01:46:59.200]   Go to Hover.com/twig.
[01:46:59.200 --> 01:47:02.160]   That's our special page.
[01:47:02.160 --> 01:47:04.280]   You'll see my smiling face.
[01:47:04.280 --> 01:47:06.320]   Hover.com/twig.
[01:47:06.320 --> 01:47:14.560]   And to get 10% off your first domain registrations, you're going to use the offer code Twig TWIG.
[01:47:14.560 --> 01:47:18.840]   The 10% offer applies to standard domains, only not premium domains.
[01:47:18.840 --> 01:47:21.440]   That's hover.com/twig.
[01:47:21.440 --> 01:47:23.440]   Use the offer code Twig to get 10% off.
[01:47:23.440 --> 01:47:25.440]   And hey, tip of the hat to Hover.
[01:47:25.440 --> 01:47:26.440]   We love them.
[01:47:26.440 --> 01:47:27.840]   We thank them for supporting this week in Google.
[01:47:27.840 --> 01:47:30.120]   All right, Gina.
[01:47:30.120 --> 01:47:32.040]   Let's continue on with this week in Google.
[01:47:32.040 --> 01:47:32.720]   See you guys later.
[01:47:33.720 --> 01:47:34.720]   Thank you, Leo.
[01:47:34.720 --> 01:47:35.720]   Right on.
[01:47:35.720 --> 01:47:36.720]   So let's wrap it up.
[01:47:36.720 --> 01:47:39.920]   We goo the tip tool and number of the week.
[01:47:39.920 --> 01:47:42.400]   I guess I guess I'll get started.
[01:47:42.400 --> 01:47:48.080]   Google has made quick office for Android and iOS free for everyone.
[01:47:48.080 --> 01:47:51.480]   So in the Google Play Store or the iTunes Store, you can download Quick Office, which
[01:47:51.480 --> 01:47:57.080]   means that you'll be able to edit Microsoft Office documents and spreadsheets and presentations
[01:47:57.080 --> 01:47:59.280]   on the go without paying a dime.
[01:47:59.280 --> 01:48:04.600]   But the tip is if you download Quick Office for Android or iOS right now between today,
[01:48:04.600 --> 01:48:09.920]   the 25th, September 25th, or tomorrow, the 26th, and you sign in with-- into your Google
[01:48:09.920 --> 01:48:16.120]   account through Quick Office, you will get 10 gigabytes of free Google Drive space for
[01:48:16.120 --> 01:48:17.560]   two years.
[01:48:17.560 --> 01:48:18.640]   So grab the app.
[01:48:18.640 --> 01:48:19.640]   It's Quick Office.
[01:48:19.640 --> 01:48:22.920]   You can search for it in the Play Store or the app store.
[01:48:22.920 --> 01:48:24.400]   Download it onto your device, sign in with it.
[01:48:24.400 --> 01:48:26.920]   And for the account that you sign in with, your Google account you sign in with, you'll
[01:48:26.920 --> 01:48:31.600]   get 10 gigabytes of free Google Drive space, which is a nice little upgrade.
[01:48:31.600 --> 01:48:34.160]   That offer is only good today and tomorrow by September 26th.
[01:48:34.160 --> 01:48:35.960]   So you can get on that now.
[01:48:35.960 --> 01:48:37.800]   A little extra space.
[01:48:37.800 --> 01:48:38.800]   Never hurt anyone.
[01:48:38.800 --> 01:48:40.800]   Also quick office is pretty good.
[01:48:40.800 --> 01:48:45.000]   Why don't you think it's on a Chrome app yet?
[01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000]   That's a good question.
[01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:48.000]   That's a good question.
[01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:49.000]   I mean, now.
[01:48:49.000 --> 01:48:52.840]   I mean, if you could bring some of this functionality and the ability to easily edit Word docs and
[01:48:52.840 --> 01:48:58.040]   such that the Quick Office has to a Chrome app that interoperates with your drive, that
[01:48:58.040 --> 01:48:59.040]   would be cool.
[01:48:59.040 --> 01:49:00.040]   Yeah.
[01:49:00.040 --> 01:49:03.520]   I mean, I don't know why all these features aren't just built in to drive, right?
[01:49:03.520 --> 01:49:04.880]   Like I use the Drive app on Android.
[01:49:04.880 --> 01:49:05.880]   Yes.
[01:49:05.880 --> 01:49:06.880]   Right.
[01:49:06.880 --> 01:49:09.000]   And why they wouldn't just build it in to drive to begin with.
[01:49:09.000 --> 01:49:10.000]   So I don't know.
[01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:12.200]   I don't know what this promotion is kind of about.
[01:49:12.200 --> 01:49:14.120]   Well, then maybe now they changed the strategy.
[01:49:14.120 --> 01:49:18.360]   This was meant to be a premium sell up to apps people and such.
[01:49:18.360 --> 01:49:21.160]   Maybe now that it's free, they will.
[01:49:21.160 --> 01:49:22.160]   Yeah.
[01:49:22.160 --> 01:49:23.160]   Maybe.
[01:49:23.160 --> 01:49:24.640]   But you're getting a good cut.
[01:49:24.640 --> 01:49:26.640]   They will eventually merge these.
[01:49:26.640 --> 01:49:33.200]   But the thing is that Microsoft documents are such a rat's nest of legacy nonsense that
[01:49:33.200 --> 01:49:37.040]   it's very, very hard to make sense of this and merging those code bases would probably
[01:49:37.040 --> 01:49:38.440]   take a really long time.
[01:49:38.440 --> 01:49:41.720]   So having alternative solutions may make more sense.
[01:49:41.720 --> 01:49:42.720]   Right.
[01:49:42.720 --> 01:49:46.880]   Yeah, the Microsoft guys have trouble keeping this stuff straight and they have the source
[01:49:46.880 --> 01:49:47.880]   code.
[01:49:47.880 --> 01:49:48.880]   Right.
[01:49:48.880 --> 01:49:50.840]   And drives does work well.
[01:49:50.840 --> 01:49:51.840]   I was in a dust door.
[01:49:51.840 --> 01:49:53.640]   Just drives a fairly good job.
[01:49:53.640 --> 01:49:57.600]   But yeah, it still turns out like do server side rendering rather than translating something
[01:49:57.600 --> 01:49:58.600]   you can edit half the time.
[01:49:58.600 --> 01:50:00.160]   But you can usually read something.
[01:50:00.160 --> 01:50:01.160]   Yeah.
[01:50:01.160 --> 01:50:02.160]   Right.
[01:50:02.160 --> 01:50:05.520]   I was in a Best Buy store the other night and there was a couple there asking about the
[01:50:05.520 --> 01:50:08.440]   Chromebook for the guy and the best buy and lushers up on the thing.
[01:50:08.440 --> 01:50:09.440]   And he used to order the ear.
[01:50:09.440 --> 01:50:11.160]   He said, no, you can't store anything.
[01:50:11.160 --> 01:50:13.800]   So I step in like Marshall McLuhan in the Woody Allen movie.
[01:50:13.800 --> 01:50:18.640]   I say, no, actually, you can store this as I do a sales pitch for the Chromebook there
[01:50:18.640 --> 01:50:21.720]   for 10 minutes and tell them just use drive and they said, oh, yeah, we like drive.
[01:50:21.720 --> 01:50:22.720]   It's fine.
[01:50:22.720 --> 01:50:23.720]   So I said, then you'll love it.
[01:50:23.720 --> 01:50:24.720]   Get it.
[01:50:24.720 --> 01:50:25.720]   School should hire you.
[01:50:25.720 --> 01:50:26.720]   You can be the blue shirt.
[01:50:26.720 --> 01:50:27.720]   You can just sell it.
[01:50:27.720 --> 01:50:28.720]   Gina from your lips.
[01:50:28.720 --> 01:50:29.720]   The very.
[01:50:29.720 --> 01:50:32.720]   We're going to get a new Dean at the school.
[01:50:32.720 --> 01:50:33.720]   You know, what's going to happen?
[01:50:33.720 --> 01:50:34.720]   I don't know what's going to happen.
[01:50:34.720 --> 01:50:35.720]   Jeff, you're your number of the week.
[01:50:35.720 --> 01:50:36.720]   Okay.
[01:50:36.720 --> 01:50:37.720]   I'm going to give you a different one than I thought.
[01:50:37.720 --> 01:50:48.280]   So we talked about the time cover story last week by Harry McCracken and company.
[01:50:48.280 --> 01:50:51.160]   And so he put up a blog post of 10 things you didn't know about Google.
[01:50:51.160 --> 01:50:53.680]   And I'm just going to give you the first one because it's the number of the week we're
[01:50:53.680 --> 01:50:56.360]   going to do Google's phone number.
[01:50:56.360 --> 01:51:01.240]   Page told him that when Google started on University Avenue with about 30 employees,
[01:51:01.240 --> 01:51:04.600]   they accidentally put their phone number up on the web.
[01:51:04.600 --> 01:51:09.040]   This reminds me of May Day on Amazon.
[01:51:09.040 --> 01:51:14.560]   So we have 30 people and I'm quoting now from Page and we already had millions of users.
[01:51:14.560 --> 01:51:17.480]   We accidentally published our phone number on our website and our phone number was just
[01:51:17.480 --> 01:51:18.480]   unusable.
[01:51:18.480 --> 01:51:22.240]   We had to get a new one then because people just started calling us.
[01:51:22.240 --> 01:51:23.880]   There's only 30 of us.
[01:51:23.880 --> 01:51:26.760]   We couldn't even answer the phone for millions of people.
[01:51:26.760 --> 01:51:28.040]   We could run a website.
[01:51:28.040 --> 01:51:32.240]   I think that shows you how it shows you the incredible multiplication factors you get
[01:51:32.240 --> 01:51:33.240]   with technology.
[01:51:33.240 --> 01:51:36.920]   You can easily run a website for millions of people with a small group, but you can't
[01:51:36.920 --> 01:51:39.400]   run a phone number with that many people.
[01:51:39.400 --> 01:51:42.400]   So that's the number of the week Google's phone number.
[01:51:42.400 --> 01:51:43.400]   I like it.
[01:51:43.400 --> 01:51:44.400]   I like it.
[01:51:44.400 --> 01:51:45.400]   That's a really good point.
[01:51:45.400 --> 01:51:50.680]   We got the number next when they abandoned it.
[01:51:50.680 --> 01:51:58.400]   I must admit, I did watch the internship on the flight over and laughed out loud at the
[01:51:58.400 --> 01:52:02.640]   fact that the idea that one of their jobs was answering the phone for complaints for
[01:52:02.640 --> 01:52:03.640]   Google.
[01:52:03.640 --> 01:52:04.640]   Yes.
[01:52:04.640 --> 01:52:10.040]   That was the funniest thing in the movie, which was like, oh, it was such a hard.
[01:52:10.040 --> 01:52:13.160]   It was really a depression that there were support people all there ready to answer your
[01:52:13.160 --> 01:52:14.640]   questions about Chrome.
[01:52:14.640 --> 01:52:17.400]   And oh, very cool.
[01:52:17.400 --> 01:52:21.840]   All right, Kevin, you're saying your tool.
[01:52:21.840 --> 01:52:23.800]   Well, I have two things.
[01:52:23.800 --> 01:52:27.080]   One that was like a follow up in the previous thing, which just reminded me.
[01:52:27.080 --> 01:52:32.800]   So there's a tweet, which I think I just threw in there, which is just amusing me because
[01:52:32.800 --> 01:52:37.480]   it was a Nick Escherora, who's the chief business officer for Google, tweeting out,
[01:52:37.480 --> 01:52:39.680]   help, I need to remove the contact lock on my phone.
[01:52:39.680 --> 01:52:40.920]   I don't have a UK credit card.
[01:52:40.920 --> 01:52:42.760]   I can't find a T-Mobile store.
[01:52:42.760 --> 01:52:49.320]   It's like, I found three on Google, but baby, you know, baby, his contact lock was bad and
[01:52:49.320 --> 01:52:51.600]   I think we could use such Google Maps.
[01:52:51.600 --> 01:52:52.600]   So that was it.
[01:52:52.600 --> 01:53:01.800]   But the slightly more serious link from that is the open rights group link, which is blocked.org.uk,
[01:53:01.800 --> 01:53:07.440]   which is where you report the wrong things being blocked on your mobile phone.
[01:53:07.440 --> 01:53:11.560]   So if you are in the UK and you try and do something and you find it's not working,
[01:53:11.560 --> 01:53:15.800]   go there and report it so that the open rights group can collate them and stop even more stupid
[01:53:15.800 --> 01:53:19.080]   censorship being imposed.
[01:53:19.080 --> 01:53:20.080]   And the--
[01:53:20.080 --> 01:53:21.080]   Tell the line.
[01:53:21.080 --> 01:53:22.080]   I haven't seen no-der.
[01:53:22.080 --> 01:53:28.720]   So the other thing was this is my standing up and publishing my stuff from XOXO.
[01:53:28.720 --> 01:53:34.640]   So Notalive is a very, very hacky tool that I wrote to do the kind of live tweeting that
[01:53:34.640 --> 01:53:43.080]   I do and I wrote it as one of the indie webcom hacks and I used it quite a lot of XOXO.
[01:53:43.080 --> 01:53:45.880]   And the--
[01:53:45.880 --> 01:53:48.320]   It's what it does is it's very simple.
[01:53:48.320 --> 01:53:51.560]   You log in with Twitter, you put in a hashtag--
[01:53:51.560 --> 01:53:55.520]   It's not going to look great unless you're actually zooming a bit.
[01:53:55.520 --> 01:53:58.840]   You put in the hashtag and the name of the person and then you just keep typing the tweets
[01:53:58.840 --> 01:54:01.440]   and hitting return and it posts them in that format.
[01:54:01.440 --> 01:54:04.800]   And then there's a change speaker button that actually typing someone else's Twitter handle
[01:54:04.800 --> 01:54:05.800]   that up.
[01:54:05.800 --> 01:54:08.680]   And the idea of this is it means that I can do the kind of live tweeting that I do more
[01:54:08.680 --> 01:54:15.360]   quickly but also the hope is that over time it will gain the ability to collate those
[01:54:15.360 --> 01:54:18.760]   tweets into something that I can post to a blog post or something else rather than just
[01:54:18.760 --> 01:54:23.080]   disappearing into Twitter and only be able to get them out when I do the download my tweets
[01:54:23.080 --> 01:54:24.080]   thing.
[01:54:24.080 --> 01:54:26.080]   So that was-- that's my little tool there.
[01:54:26.080 --> 01:54:31.800]   And the sources up on GitHub and if people want to help try it out or send me bug reports
[01:54:31.800 --> 01:54:34.920]   or patches, I'm very happy to get them.
[01:54:34.920 --> 01:54:35.920]   Very cool.
[01:54:35.920 --> 01:54:36.920]   And you use Node.
[01:54:36.920 --> 01:54:37.920]   Nice.
[01:54:37.920 --> 01:54:38.920]   Are you supposed to--
[01:54:38.920 --> 01:54:39.920]   Node-fit, yeah.
[01:54:39.920 --> 01:54:40.920]   Uh-huh.
[01:54:40.920 --> 01:54:45.600]   No is very good for these quick and dirty little web things.
[01:54:45.600 --> 01:54:47.680]   Node and Heroku together make a good combination.
[01:54:47.680 --> 01:54:48.680]   Yep.
[01:54:48.680 --> 01:54:49.680]   Yep.
[01:54:49.680 --> 01:54:50.680]   Very cool.
[01:54:50.680 --> 01:54:51.680]   I have starred your repository.
[01:54:51.680 --> 01:54:52.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:54:52.680 --> 01:54:53.680]   Awesome.
[01:54:53.680 --> 01:54:58.320]   Well, thank you very much, Kevin, for joining us today.
[01:54:58.320 --> 01:55:02.760]   It was-- I was a little nervous about filling Leo's giant shoes, the Dr. Evil chair but it
[01:55:02.760 --> 01:55:06.000]   was really good to have you on the show, have you a familiar face who's been on the show.
[01:55:06.000 --> 01:55:08.280]   Do you have anything else that you want to plug?
[01:55:08.280 --> 01:55:12.640]   What's going on with television or sales force or anything else you want to tell us
[01:55:12.640 --> 01:55:13.640]   about?
[01:55:13.640 --> 01:55:15.200]   Um, not-- not a lot directly.
[01:55:15.200 --> 01:55:21.120]   I mean, the interesting thing about television is that the reason I was-- the other reason
[01:55:21.120 --> 01:55:25.400]   that I like Clive's book was that he mentions the television a couple of times, which is
[01:55:25.400 --> 01:55:26.400]   very nice.
[01:55:26.400 --> 01:55:27.400]   Nice.
[01:55:27.400 --> 01:55:32.040]   So I did see Deb over the weekend and we keep saying we should start this again but at the
[01:55:32.040 --> 01:55:35.040]   moment, it's still in hiatus.
[01:55:35.040 --> 01:55:36.040]   Mm-hmm.
[01:55:36.040 --> 01:55:37.040]   Cool.
[01:55:37.040 --> 01:55:38.040]   Cool.
[01:55:38.040 --> 01:55:39.040]   Well, thank you so much for joining us today.
[01:55:39.040 --> 01:55:40.040]   Thank you, Kevin.
[01:55:40.040 --> 01:55:41.040]   And Jeff, thank you so much.
[01:55:41.040 --> 01:55:42.880]   It was a lot of fun as usual.
[01:55:42.880 --> 01:55:43.880]   Oh, it was wonderful.
[01:55:43.880 --> 01:55:44.880]   Great work, Gina.
[01:55:44.880 --> 01:55:47.840]   You kept things going to pace and we covered a lot.
[01:55:47.840 --> 01:55:48.840]   Thank you.
[01:55:48.840 --> 01:55:49.840]   Yeah, we did.
[01:55:49.840 --> 01:55:52.560]   I think technical difficulties was a lot of fun.
[01:55:52.560 --> 01:55:56.120]   I still-- I don't feel like I totally filled the big chair but we made it.
[01:55:56.120 --> 01:55:58.120]   I hope Leo's having a really, really good vacation.
[01:55:58.120 --> 01:56:00.600]   I want people to know just to-- I sat in the chat room.
[01:56:00.600 --> 01:56:03.480]   There was a period in the beginning where Kevin and I talked a lot, which we normally
[01:56:03.480 --> 01:56:05.600]   do a lot but we really talked a lot.
[01:56:05.600 --> 01:56:06.720]   Gina's Skype went down.
[01:56:06.720 --> 01:56:07.720]   That's why.
[01:56:07.720 --> 01:56:09.720]   Well, we weren't trying to shut her up.
[01:56:09.720 --> 01:56:10.720]   At keeping going.
[01:56:10.720 --> 01:56:11.720]   Yes.
[01:56:11.720 --> 01:56:14.320]   We did that very well but that was a point where we were trying to famp.
[01:56:14.320 --> 01:56:15.320]   Thank you very much.
[01:56:15.320 --> 01:56:16.320]   Thank you.
[01:56:16.320 --> 01:56:17.320]   Thank you.
[01:56:17.320 --> 01:56:18.320]   You too.
[01:56:18.320 --> 01:56:19.320]   No.
[01:56:19.320 --> 01:56:21.880]   You were totally silent and you sounded like drowned robots.
[01:56:21.880 --> 01:56:25.920]   I couldn't understand anything and I hung up and then we were reconnecting on Skype.
[01:56:25.920 --> 01:56:28.000]   So thank you for filling that in, you guys.
[01:56:28.000 --> 01:56:30.680]   And yeah, no, they weren't Kevin and Jeff were not.
[01:56:30.680 --> 01:56:32.560]   We're not blocking me on the couch.
[01:56:32.560 --> 01:56:35.160]   You don't even know who to do it but that time it worked.
[01:56:35.160 --> 01:56:38.000]   Well, thank you so much.
[01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:42.680]   We do this week in Google every Wednesday at 1 p.m. Pacific, 4 p.m. Eastern.
[01:56:42.680 --> 01:56:45.320]   I don't know UTC off the top.
[01:56:45.320 --> 01:56:46.320]   But thank you guys.
[01:56:46.320 --> 01:56:47.320]   We'll be back next week.
[01:56:47.320 --> 01:56:52.240]   And thank you to Chad for doing expert jobs, watching the show as usual.
[01:56:52.240 --> 01:56:53.240]   Thank you everyone.
[01:56:53.240 --> 01:56:53.240]   See you next week.
[01:56:53.240 --> 01:57:03.240]   (music)
