[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200]   It's time for Twig this week and Google Gina has the day off Matthew Ingram from Giga
[00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.160]   Home Joints, Jeff Jarvis and me to talk about what happens to your accounts when you pass
[00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:15.880]   away, trolls in the internet hood, and of course everything new from Google, including
[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.640]   a new classroom project that looks pretty darn good.
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.640]   It's all coming up next on Twig.
[00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:33.520]   Netcast you love from people you trust. This is Twig.
[00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:45.360]   Bandwidth for this week in Google is provided by cashfly, C A C H E F L Y dot com. This is
[00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.840]   Twig this week in Google, Episode 262, recorded August 13th, 2014.
[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.600]   I'm not in the moodle.

[00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.360]   It's time for this week in Google Twig, the show that covers Google, but not just Google,
[00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.280]   the cloud, the Facebook, the Twitter, all that stuff.
[00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.120]   Jeff Jarvis, that's what we cover.
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:34.200]   And anything that pisses off Jeff, if it's in Germany, anywhere, he'll let you know.
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.000]   Jeff Jarvis is here.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.480]   He is the professor of journalism at the City University of New York, book author.
[00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.920]   His most recent is called Public Parts.
[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.640]   He's also a blogger at Buzzmachine.com and a man about the world.
[00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:49.640]   World traveler.
[00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:50.640]   Hey, Jeff.
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.000]   Hey there, I sneezed.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.560]   And he's got allergies.
[00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.160]   I kept waiting for Jeff to search to be the thought.
[00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:02.560]   Oh, now I sneeze on my touchscreen.
[00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:03.560]   That's terrible.
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.520]   Gina has swamped with work at ThinkUp.com.
[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.720]   Her startup happens from time to time.
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.040]   The good news, Matthew Ingram, is here.
[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.280]   So it's always great to have Matthew from GigaOM.
[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.280]   And he's up.
[00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.920]   But you can tell he's at the cabin.
[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.920]   Did you cut those logs yourself, Abe?
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.320]   No, I did not.
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.720]   That was someone hundred or so years ago.
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:25.720]   It's beautiful up there.
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.920]   Because hemlock, believe it or not.
[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:28.920]   Hamlock.
[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:29.920]   Yeah.
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:30.920]   The whole cabin is hemlock.
[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.320]   Are you obviously in New England somewhere?
[00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:34.320]   Yeah.
[00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:35.320]   No.
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.040]   Ontario, Northern Ontario.
[00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.040]   Yeah.
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.040]   Doesn't everybody in Canada have a summer cabin?
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.080]   Not everyone, but almost everyone.
[00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.800]   We certainly have an, we certainly have enough room if everybody wanted one.
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:51.800]   Yeah.
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:52.800]   It's like Sweden.
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.280]   It seems like everybody in Sweden has a summer cabin.
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.320]   Well, in fact, Robertson Davies, a wonderful, wonderful Canadian novelist.
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.600]   Always said that Canada is not like America.
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:02.600]   It's like Scandinavia.
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:03.600]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.600]   Very similar, yeah.
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.200]   It's cold a lot of the time.
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.200]   People are friendlier.
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.200]   They're nicer.
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.200]   Friendlier.
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.200]   Yeah.
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.920]   They don't have Mounties in Scandinavia, however.
[00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.560]   True.
[00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.480]   But hemlock, wow.
[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:25.000]   I always think of hemlock as the poison that Socrates drank.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.560]   But that's a tree also.
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:33.040]   So you don't want to lick the cabin.
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.280]   When the chatroom Jeff tells us hemlock is the hardest of the softwoods.
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.280]   It is.
[00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.280]   True.
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.480]   Always just learn all kinds of things.
[00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:42.960]   You're on big.
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:46.560]   If you see Heisenberg, say hi for us.
[00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.760]   Everybody in Michigan has summer cabins.
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:52.400]   Michigan, going up to the lake in Michigan is a big thing.
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.200]   It's beautiful, beautiful.
[00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.040]   I'm just jealous.
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:59.760]   I wish I had a summer cabin.
[00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.440]   So what has been going on in the world of Google?
[00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:11.520]   They've invested $300 million in an underwater cable to Japan.
[00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:17.160]   So I found that one interesting was because I've been doing some research on a project
[00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.160]   I'm kind of working on.
[00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:19.160]   I'm a panicky stuff.
[00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:25.040]   And I went through lots and lots of old clips from the New York Times and from the Guardian
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.200]   and the Observer on the lane of the first Atlantic cable.
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:35.800]   And I was just amazed at the jubilation.
[00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.960]   The first cable worked for the Queen's set a message, but it wasn't the full message.
[00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:41.960]   They didn't know that.
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.680]   It took 17 hours to get the whole message across by the time we fixed stuff.
[00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.600]   And then the President set a message back and then the word got through the landline
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.600]   cable to New York.
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:57.360]   And there were fireworks and parades and jubilation.
[00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.360]   Elmyra, New York.
[00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.880]   There were street off cannons.
[00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:05.480]   The church bells rang the next day for an hour.
[00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:09.320]   You could send a dot across the Atlantic.
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:13.400]   It was considered a huge breakthrough like equivalent of putting a man on the moon.
[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.200]   So I was thinking about this.
[00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.880]   And I was thinking that one of the mistakes I think that Google and Facebook and Twitter
[00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:25.080]   and all of our dear beloved tech companies we talk about are making these days.
[00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.640]   Is there not making technology actually?
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:31.480]   I think there ought to be a Google World's Fair.
[00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:32.680]   What do you think about that?
[00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.760]   Oh, what a great idea.
[00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:39.680]   Isn't that what the World Fair was originally was to show progress?
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.200]   Right.
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:45.600]   I remember going to the 1965 or 64 World's Fair in New York City.
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:50.360]   That's if you drive out, if you're on the way out to JFK and you pass a giant globe
[00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:55.040]   and some other stuff that's left over from the World's Fair.
[00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:59.440]   And then you in Canada, you had a Expo 76.
[00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:00.280]   67.
[00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:03.640]   66, 77, 67.
[00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:04.640]   Expo 67.
[00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:08.160]   That's the last World's Fair I remember.
[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:08.680]   Have there been--
[00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:09.760]   I just got a stop.
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:11.200]   I was on five.
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.080]   You were only five beautiful expos.
[00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:14.080]   Well, I wonder whether--
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:14.600]   Shut up.
[00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:16.560]   You know, Google had something like that.
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.760]   Wouldn't a lot of that stuff terrify people?
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:24.200]   I mean, if Google had a World's Fair and it had driverless cars and all sorts of futuristic
[00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.880]   stuff, I mean, a lot of that is kind of--
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:31.040]   Yeah, but if you think back to the stuff we saw in the GE home of the future and so
[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:36.040]   on, I think some of it is a little bit left to Disney World.
[00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:36.560]   I know.
[00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:40.960]   I think we're just not being-- I think we're allowing the scaremongers and the technophobes
[00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:42.560]   to take over the discussion.
[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:45.160]   And we should be saying at some point, wow.
[00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:49.160]   Yeah.
[00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:51.640]   The next World's Fair is coming up in Milan.
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:54.360]   It'll be Expo 2015.
[00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:55.160]   Oh, really?
[00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.520]   Well, there you go.
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:59.280]   There's no like-- it's not the Olympic Committee.
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.560]   There's no like World's Fair Committee, is there?
[00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:02.200]   No.
[00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:03.120]   I wasn't talking about that.
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:03.960]   No, I don't pick a--
[00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:08.440]   According to Wikipedia, they originated in the French tradition of national exhibit
[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:12.600]   exhibitions, the tradition that culminated with the French industrial
[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:15.600]   exposition of 1844 in Paris.
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:20.600]   And they moved people in Europe and the United Kingdom did it.
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:26.120]   The best known first world expo was in the Crystal Palace in Hyde Park, which still stands.
[00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:28.600]   Right.
[00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:32.440]   Where the first TV station was set up in London.
[00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:33.800]   In 1851?
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:34.800]   Right.
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:35.440]   No, no, no.
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:35.920]   Oh.
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:36.720]   At the Crystal Palace.
[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:37.720]   No, at the Crystal Palace.
[00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:40.200]   That's going to say, wow.
[00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:43.440]   So there have been a number of these expositions.
[00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:49.200]   Of course, the Paris Eiffel Tower was built, wasn't it, for World's Fair?
[00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:56.560]   As was the first Ferris wheel in Chicago in 1893.
[00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:59.280]   So Matthew, how about this as a thought?
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:02.840]   The point of-- yeah, I think that if it says, oh, look at all the scary stuff
[00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:04.440]   we can do, you're right.
[00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:06.200]   If instead it demystified things.
[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:07.280]   It explained things.
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:09.720]   It showed you the benefits and the wonders.
[00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:12.960]   It showed you a better world because of it.
[00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:14.880]   Now it's just mysterious technology.
[00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:17.800]   These geeks are doing things we don't understand.
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:23.360]   And if it brought it down into life more and said, here's where we're headed with even
[00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:27.240]   things that are scaring people like health and data and health.
[00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:31.320]   And here's how information is stored and searched today.
[00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:35.760]   And here's how sensors are going to change your life.
[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:38.040]   And here's-- I don't know.
[00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:38.800]   Maybe it's not a big deal.
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:41.840]   Yeah, no, I think that's a good point.
[00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:48.360]   I mean, they could definitely do-- in fact, all companies could do a better job of pointing
[00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:51.040]   out why you would even want to do these things.
[00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:54.880]   So why would you want to give all your data to this company?
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:08:58.320]   Or why would you want to log in every time you do x or y?
[00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:00.360]   Why would you want sensors and everything?
[00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:05.240]   And to give you the kind of-- like, people are always going to say, well, you could do
[00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:07.600]   this bad thing or this other bad thing.
[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:14.320]   But at least if you talked about the positive reasons why you might want to and how it could
[00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:19.320]   help your life, then you could kind of start the conversation off on the right foot.
[00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:23.920]   Yeah, and that's been my research that I'm working on is that there are people who said
[00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:26.960]   bad things could happen with every technology we've seen.
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:32.240]   And so the telegraph-- and people who also say-- they put up a paper tiger and say, well,
[00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:34.400]   it didn't change world and bring a world peace.
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:37.400]   Not that anybody said it was going to.
[00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:41.680]   The telegraph was ratcheted up that way and then shot down.
[00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:43.920]   The funny thing about the telegraph was after all this--
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:44.920]   Actually, the telegraph was--
[00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:47.760]   Go ahead.
[00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:51.440]   I was just going to say when you mentioned the telegraph, it reminded me.
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:54.600]   I had just seen a news story.
[00:09:54.600 --> 00:10:00.000]   Someone posted on Twitter a sort of image of this news story from the early days of the
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   telegraph.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:10.280]   They were criticizing it as speeding up information too much and why would we need all this extraneous
[00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:12.760]   information from some faraway plays?
[00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:15.320]   And there was a degree in the France.
[00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:18.960]   Yeah, and it was exactly the same stuff people say about Twitter.
[00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:23.680]   So if you had just taken out the word telegraph and put in Twitter, it sounded exactly the
[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:24.680]   same.
[00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:32.280]   Really there must be some sort of need for higher speed connection between California
[00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:36.520]   and the west coast of the United States and Japan.
[00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:41.480]   This cable known as Faster will cost in total 300 million.
[00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:43.960]   I think this headline is wrong.
[00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:45.440]   Forbes says Google, "Investor."
[00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:47.440]   No, it's just in.
[00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:50.880]   Google invests in a $300 million cable.
[00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:52.720]   Google's investment is not that.
[00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:55.880]   They just invested in one a few years ago, didn't they?
[00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:56.880]   It's interesting.
[00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:57.880]   This is not their first.
[00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:58.880]   Yeah.
[00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:01.080]   They invested another on our cable, yes.
[00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:08.600]   If you're interested in the technology, it is a six fiber pair cable and optical transmission
[00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:16.840]   technology's initial capacity of 60 terabytes, I'm sorry, tera bits per second with six
[00:11:16.840 --> 00:11:21.920]   pairs because each pair is capable of 100 wavelengths each, 100 gigabits.
[00:11:21.920 --> 00:11:23.760]   Wow, it's really interesting.
[00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:26.120]   That's a lot of capacity.
[00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:31.920]   China Mobile International, China Telecom Global, Global Transit, KDDI and SingTell,
[00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:35.440]   the other investors, mostly Asian telecoms.
[00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:38.400]   NEC, I didn't know this.
[00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:40.560]   Is it the same NEC NIP on Electric?
[00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:42.920]   Is the top vendor of submarine cable systems?
[00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:44.440]   They'll be the system supplier.
[00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:45.440]   Google--
[00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:47.440]   How do you get on a printer business?
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:50.200]   Yeah, really.
[00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:55.720]   Do they also sell the equipment that the NSA uses with the subs where they tap into the
[00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:56.720]   cable?
[00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:59.480]   Yeah, well, if you're going to build the cable, you've got to build that in.
[00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:00.480]   It's a lot easier.
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:01.480]   That's right.
[00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:02.480]   Google subs, not Google.
[00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:04.120]   They say subs.
[00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:08.440]   Do they actually go down to the cable, tap into it and then come back?
[00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:11.080]   They drop a thing.
[00:12:11.080 --> 00:12:15.720]   They drop like a device and it attaches to the cable and then they just suck the data
[00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:16.720]   out.
[00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:17.720]   Incredible.
[00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:18.720]   Incredible.
[00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:19.720]   Incredible.
[00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:25.040]   At Google, this is Google Senior Vice President of Technical Infrastructure, Google Fellow,
[00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:26.760]   ERS-Hulsil-Hertzel.
[00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:30.640]   Post at Google, we want our products to be fast and reliable.
[00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:36.160]   That requires a great network infrastructure, whether it's for the more than a billion Android
[00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:37.160]   users.
[00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:39.000]   You've got to get the plug in.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:44.280]   Or developers, building products on Google Cloud Platform, sometimes the fastest path
[00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:46.280]   requires going through an ocean.
[00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:48.080]   Oh, I like that.
[00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:51.920]   That's why we're investing in faster, a new undersea cable to connect the West Coast.
[00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:55.960]   It's two coastal locations in Japan.
[00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:59.000]   The capacity is 10 million times faster than your cable modem.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:06.360]   You threw that one in to Chikura and Shema in Japan.
[00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:12.840]   There are already 200 fiber optic cables on our sea, transport internet data around the
[00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:17.200]   world carrying more than 95% of trans oceanic voice and data traffic.
[00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:20.280]   You might think it's satellite, but that's too slow.
[00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:21.280]   Underwater cables.
[00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:26.800]   They carry 51 billion gigabytes a month.
[00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:27.800]   Facebook has...
[00:13:27.800 --> 00:13:30.640]   This is Google invested in unity in 2011.
[00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:32.440]   Yeah, this isn't the first time.
[00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:33.440]   In SJC.
[00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:34.440]   Yeah.
[00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:35.440]   Facebook has done the same.
[00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:39.800]   They have a stake in a underwater cable consortium between Malaysia, South Korea, Japan,
[00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:41.520]   Singapore, Hong Kong, and China.
[00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:44.640]   It's kind of interesting.
[00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:49.040]   I'm not sure why these big companies get involved in this, but it's kind of interesting.
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:54.840]   It will be lit up a second quarter of 2016 in the US.
[00:13:54.840 --> 00:14:00.800]   It will connect to hubs in LA, San Francisco, Portland, and Seattle.
[00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:04.320]   It's kind of neat.
[00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:08.800]   It's an interesting thing that they feel they need to get in this business.
[00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:14.080]   Yeah, it's not known like they're going to be in the...
[00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:15.080]   Both ends of it.
[00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:19.240]   They're in the fiber of the home business and they're in the fiber to Japan business.
[00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:24.720]   Well, I understand kind of doing it in the US to check just kind of to kick current ISPs
[00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:25.720]   in the butt.
[00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:28.200]   I mean, that makes a lot of sense.
[00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:29.800]   Which is kind of working too.
[00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:30.800]   It is working.
[00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:31.800]   Time Warner and others are starting.
[00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:36.880]   Time Warner Austin's now got 100 megabit symmetric.
[00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:37.880]   That's right.
[00:14:37.880 --> 00:14:39.880]   Austin really has been...
[00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:41.520]   It wasn't for Google.
[00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:43.720]   Yeah, no, of course not.
[00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:46.640]   I think Austin among all the cities has benefited a lot.
[00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:51.680]   I guess because it's probably larger than KC, I don't know.
[00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:59.080]   I don't know my mind if I bump in, but what's that quote to write?
[00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:00.080]   Great software.
[00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:01.680]   You need to make the hardware.
[00:15:01.680 --> 00:15:03.840]   It's kind of how I feel with this in Google.
[00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:05.280]   It's so infrastructure.
[00:15:05.280 --> 00:15:08.360]   They need to make sure that they own part of the infrastructure.
[00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:10.680]   It's Chad Johnson, our producer.
[00:15:10.680 --> 00:15:16.600]   Well, when you think about it, the quality of their apps, the quality of their services,
[00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:17.600]   the quality of...
[00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:22.240]   I mean, people notice billions of a second when they're loading pages.
[00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:23.240]   Google's...
[00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:28.640]   I mean, that's a huge part of their UI offering that people is going to be fast.
[00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:29.640]   It's always going to be there.
[00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:31.080]   It's always going to work.
[00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:35.360]   And if you're using Google now or something and it's trying to get information and it's
[00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:38.520]   slow because of someone else's network, that looks bad on Google.
[00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:39.520]   Right.
[00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:40.520]   Oh, I was wrong.
[00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:44.920]   I was so Comcast and Time Warner also increasing speeds in Kansas City.
[00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:46.560]   Yes, that's what I'm...
[00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:47.560]   I was wrong.
[00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:48.560]   So it is.
[00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:49.560]   It's everywhere, right?
[00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:50.560]   It's having an impact.
[00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:51.560]   Yeah.
[00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:52.560]   Fascinating.
[00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:53.560]   Yep.
[00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:57.640]   But I found that quote, Matthew.
[00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:03.200]   So far as the influence of the newspaper upon the mind and morals of the people's concerned,
[00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:08.040]   there can be no rational doubt that the telegraph has caused vast injury.
[00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:09.040]   Superfusion.
[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:15.680]   But un-sifted, too fast for the truth, must be all telegraphic intelligence.
[00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:18.800]   Does it not render the popular mind too fast for the truth?
[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:22.560]   Ten days bring us the males from Europe.
[00:16:22.560 --> 00:16:26.400]   What need is there for the scraps of news in ten minutes?
[00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:27.880]   Oh my God!
[00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:31.160]   And poultry is the telegraphic color.
[00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:32.160]   It snowed here.
[00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:33.240]   It rained there.
[00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:35.560]   One man killed another, hanged.
[00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:39.800]   Even the Washington letter has...
[00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:42.080]   Oh, I can't read the word in the type.
[00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:47.160]   Since the innovation, and I can consciously recommend my own epistles prior to 1844 in
[00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:53.920]   preference of those of later years, said the New York Times, Washington, chorus, "fascinating."
[00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:55.440]   Oh, there he is.
[00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:56.440]   He also says...
[00:16:56.440 --> 00:17:00.560]   That's the equivalent of...
[00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:04.000]   He also says that it will be of great use cannot be questioned.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.640]   And how will its uses add to the happiness of mankind?
[00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:10.160]   Has the land telegraph done any good?
[00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:14.080]   Has it banished any evil, mitigated any sorrow?
[00:17:14.080 --> 00:17:17.720]   Is it of any consequence that you and New York should know on Tuesday rather than on
[00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:22.720]   Wednesday that Jones smashed the nose of Thompson in Congress on Monday?
[00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:27.640]   Upon the whole, is any more money gained or lost by the cotton speculators of New York
[00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:29.640]   and New Orleans?
[00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:33.480]   Because they know the variations of both markets five minutes rather than five days
[00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:36.080]   before their operations take an effect.
[00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:40.480]   Is not the English relative's increased by hearing day to day that the wife or son has
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:45.440]   breathed at his last and by receiving ten days after the sad details of sickness and
[00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:46.440]   death?
[00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:52.200]   I just find it interesting that John C. de Vorac was writing even then.
[00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:57.120]   Well done.
[00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:58.120]   You know, it's...
[00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:00.040]   Boy, that's fascinating.
[00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:03.040]   That's the New York Times, 1858.
[00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:04.040]   I think so.
[00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:05.040]   It's a simple...
[00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:14.920]   I think back to my first trip to Europe as a kid, I was in fifth grade, it was in 1967.
[00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:19.160]   And we spent the summer there and I was so interested in baseball at the time and I
[00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:25.000]   wanted another scores and you couldn't get the baseball scores until like 36 hours later
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:31.040]   when the Herald Tribune came out and they used telegraph to send the baseball scores.
[00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:35.440]   And now everything's instantaneous everywhere.
[00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:37.520]   So it isn't even just from 1860.
[00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:38.520]   It's from 1960.
[00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:43.160]   I mean, we've seen a huge revolution.
[00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:48.960]   And I don't think anybody would agree at this point that faster information is worse, but
[00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:52.520]   we do have to learn how to sift through the faster information.
[00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:55.120]   In fact, all you have to...
[00:18:55.120 --> 00:19:00.160]   A number of people wrote after Robin Williams untimely passing earlier this week that Twitter
[00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:03.800]   is now where people would go to die, basically.
[00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:08.360]   I mean, Matthew, you got something to say about that.
[00:19:08.360 --> 00:19:09.360]   Hmm.
[00:19:09.360 --> 00:19:10.360]   Didn't you?
[00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:11.360]   Yeah.
[00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:16.000]   And Dylan Byers was complaining about how Twitter turns into the worst possible place
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:18.520]   when people die, people like Robin Williams.
[00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:21.480]   And I argued that it's actually the opposite.
[00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:22.640]   I find it the opposite.
[00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:28.100]   I know there are horrible things like his daughter was basically driven off Twitter by
[00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:29.600]   trolls and so on.
[00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:34.840]   I'm not saying it's a paradise or that nothing bad happens.
[00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:41.520]   But I actually enjoyed seeing people talking about him mentioning movies that I had forgotten
[00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:45.120]   about or mentioning roles that I remembered.
[00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:51.680]   It felt very much to me like standing around at an actual funeral, talking to your friends
[00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:55.040]   or acquaintances or family members about that person.
[00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:57.320]   I enjoyed that.
[00:19:57.320 --> 00:20:01.960]   It helped me to remember what I liked about him.
[00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:06.240]   I feel so bad for his daughter Zelda, but I think you're right.
[00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:08.880]   And trolls, just what are we going to do about this?
[00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:10.600]   This is so sad.
[00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:12.240]   It really is.
[00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:13.240]   It is terrible.
[00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:15.440]   No question.
[00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:17.960]   But I found...
[00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:21.040]   I guess, Matthew, I go through a cycle on it.
[00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:23.440]   On the one hand, what's going to happen when something horrible like that happens?
[00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:29.960]   I was a great fan of Robin Williams and remember him from his days on stage in San Francisco.
[00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:32.720]   I kind of couldn't read it.
[00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:34.480]   So at first I knew what was going to happen.
[00:20:34.480 --> 00:20:36.440]   Everybody discovers.
[00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:37.440]   He died.
[00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:38.440]   He died.
[00:20:38.440 --> 00:20:39.440]   He died.
[00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:40.440]   Okay.
[00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:41.480]   No, we don't need you to be the town of Briarones.
[00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:45.160]   Then there were personal reactions back, which I like you I do appreciate.
[00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:46.840]   And then comes the media overdose.
[00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:47.840]   We couldn't go anywhere.
[00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:49.560]   We're rehashing the same thing.
[00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:53.800]   The basic single bit of news is this tragic moment, he's dead.
[00:20:53.800 --> 00:20:54.800]   That's the news.
[00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:57.800]   And actually it got even...
[00:20:57.800 --> 00:21:04.040]   I mean, one of the things I mentioned that I didn't really get into was after the, you
[00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:09.760]   know, oh, he's dead in the sort of morning, then came the press conference and police
[00:21:09.760 --> 00:21:12.920]   effectively giving horrible, you know, really horrible.
[00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:19.200]   They gave out his street address and details that were just not for public consumption.
[00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:21.200]   I heard all the more he knows.
[00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:27.160]   At one point said, Andy Carvin said, you know, they're basically, this is basically the police
[00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:34.200]   press conference, this is based how to, you know, it gave so many details about the suicide,
[00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:35.680]   which is generally frowned on.
[00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:41.040]   This is not the one of the things social media did so well, Jenny Jardin on Boeing,
[00:21:41.040 --> 00:21:46.000]   referred and a lot of people subsequently referred to a document about how to communicate
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:51.840]   about suicide to try to minimize the contagion factor, because there's a strong contagion
[00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:52.840]   factor.
[00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:57.640]   I think in Toto, I mean, obviously there were trolls and there was some horrible stuff.
[00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:01.680]   But the worst people were the media people, not the social media people.
[00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:05.200]   Mainstream media and the police were far worse.
[00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:08.800]   ABC setting helicopters over his house.
[00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:10.360]   That was ridiculous.
[00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:15.200]   And I'm wondering, Joe, this morning they complained that there was a story on ABC about
[00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:18.440]   family asks privacy respected and then a link went on any further.
[00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:20.440]   Go see video right now over their house.
[00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:21.440]   Right.
[00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:22.440]   See video of the house.
[00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:23.440]   No news value whatsoever.
[00:22:23.440 --> 00:22:24.440]   Horrible.
[00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:30.840]   But the thing I did find interesting, you know, apart from all the bad stuff was because
[00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:35.880]   he had fought depression and addiction for so long and because he committed suicide, there
[00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:42.400]   was a lot of people talking about depression, talking about suicide, talking about, you know,
[00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:47.160]   how to deal with those things, talking about, you know, steps you can take or places you
[00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:48.240]   can go.
[00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:50.320]   That kind of thing is actually hugely valuable.
[00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:53.280]   It very rarely gets talked about in public.
[00:22:53.280 --> 00:22:56.920]   And so, you know, I did, I thought that was a big benefit.
[00:22:56.920 --> 00:22:57.920]   There's hope.
[00:22:57.920 --> 00:23:03.080]   But what issue would it come in at a time of, of death is that we, we tiptoe and, and,
[00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:06.560]   you know, the Guardian had a piece this morning saying that the, that suicide is not a selfish
[00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:07.560]   act.
[00:23:07.560 --> 00:23:12.800]   And as I think about his children, I'm not sure that I agree with that, but one can't say
[00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:13.800]   that.
[00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:19.480]   And especially in America, there's a time of, you know, in, in, in UK, they do pretty
[00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:22.120]   blunt obits that bring up people's faults.
[00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:24.440]   We don't believe in doing that in the US and Canada.
[00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:25.440]   You're always nice.
[00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:29.480]   So that's the way you are.
[00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:34.960]   And so there are some, some difficult things to talk about too that you don't say because
[00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:38.440]   of the respect of the, of the, of the past.
[00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:39.440]   True.
[00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:42.400]   It's a lot of these.
[00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:47.440]   All the 140 characters, eulogies kind of on the one hand, I mean, you, it's, it's really
[00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:50.800]   great to see the outpouring, right?
[00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:53.680]   And, and to hear what other celebrities, their memories and so forth.
[00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:57.800]   But you can't say that much in 140 characters, but at least it's something.
[00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:02.360]   I think it is the chance is at least initially a chance for everybody to express how they
[00:24:02.360 --> 00:24:03.360]   feel about it.
[00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:04.360]   Yes.
[00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:09.480]   And I remember some of these issues came up when I, it was a couple of years ago, a friend
[00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:12.800]   of mine died, a close friend of cancer.
[00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:18.600]   And I, he looked in the media and was a heavy user of social media.
[00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:25.920]   And so I, on the spur of the moment at his funeral, I decided to live to eat his funeral.
[00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:31.760]   And in part, it was an experiment, but actually in part, it was a tribute to him because he
[00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:33.960]   was such a big user of social media.
[00:24:33.960 --> 00:24:38.080]   And he was always experimenting with different ways to use it.
[00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:43.560]   And I got a lot of, the funny thing was I got a lot of support and I got a lot of criticism.
[00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:50.560]   A lot of people said it was not appropriate and it was kind of just unseemly and, and
[00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:54.440]   then I had a lot of other people, including family members of his who couldn't make it
[00:24:54.440 --> 00:25:00.600]   to the funeral, who said, thank you for doing this because we weren't able to, to sort of
[00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:01.840]   participate.
[00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:06.240]   And so we, we got a window into those events through you tweeting.
[00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:13.720]   So to me it was, it showed how, you know, how there is still a lot of resistance to, to
[00:25:13.720 --> 00:25:19.360]   that sort of thing, but how there's also a lot of benefits that can come out of it.
[00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:24.880]   You know, if you may tweet, I want to go run record right now, Jeff and ask you, you may
[00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:28.000]   tweet live or otherwise my funeral.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.920]   I encourage you to do so.
[00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:30.920]   Okay.
[00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:33.680]   And we could have a live stream and just don't.
[00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:35.360]   We will wear Google Glass.
[00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:37.200]   Yeah, we're Google Glass.
[00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:40.120]   Well, you know, here's the question about, about your digital will.
[00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:45.320]   And this has been talked about, I suppose one should put in a safe place, one's passwords
[00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:50.880]   and such and digital wishes so that one's family can, I could do with what, what blog
[00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:55.680]   what I want and, and get into my Gmail and such and so forth.
[00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:56.680]   Yeah.
[00:25:56.680 --> 00:26:00.680]   Definitely.
[00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:07.640]   You know, I, are there, aren't there sites that do this?
[00:26:07.640 --> 00:26:08.640]   There was a lot of stuff.
[00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:11.880]   I don't know if we talked about a show about a year ago where if you didn't post something
[00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:14.680]   within certain amount of time, it would stand out.
[00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:16.280]   I should have wanted that, right?
[00:26:16.280 --> 00:26:18.680]   Wasn't that a brush would he have to cite?
[00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:19.680]   Yeah.
[00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:26.080]   And the idea is if, if it, yeah, if he dies, if you don't hear from me, what it'll start
[00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:30.360]   to do is it will start to, instead of giving away passengers of it, it'll just start to
[00:26:30.360 --> 00:26:35.240]   retweet and redo everything that he did the last year.
[00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:36.240]   So it's a digital ghost.
[00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:37.240]   Keeps him alive.
[00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:38.240]   It keeps him alive.
[00:26:38.240 --> 00:26:39.240]   It's a digital ghost.
[00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:40.240]   It's a digital ghost.
[00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:46.320]   Daniel Suarez is Damon, which is a wonderful novel, the premise of which is that a brilliant
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:53.200]   programmer and game developer creates a demon, a demon that is inserted into the public
[00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:57.680]   internet upon his death, and it does all this stuff.
[00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:02.560]   It comes, basically, it comes alive on the net.
[00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:03.560]   We don't yet have that technology.
[00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:04.560]   I don't know how.
[00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:11.520]   Well, Google has the built-in, you can give an address and email address and phone number
[00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:16.840]   of the person you want to be notified if there's a lack of activity in your account.
[00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:17.920]   I think it's Gmail.
[00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:18.920]   That was new, yeah.
[00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:19.920]   Yeah.
[00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:21.920]   Is it a lab thing?
[00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:22.920]   Did you do it?
[00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:23.920]   Not sure.
[00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:25.120]   Yeah, it did.
[00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:33.960]   And so if you don't log in for a certain amount of time, it notifies some next of kin.
[00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:36.440]   Pretty sure that's how it works.
[00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:37.600]   I forget what it's called, though.
[00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:42.240]   Yeah, I remember when they announced that.
[00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:46.200]   I want to leave my blog up but turn off all the damn comments.
[00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:48.440]   I will not be trolled in death.
[00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:49.440]   Yeah.
[00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:54.040]   They just need a lot that can reply on your behalf.
[00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:59.640]   Google Public Policy Blog, plan your digital active life with inactive account manager.
[00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:04.480]   It sounds like an April Fool's joke.
[00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:08.800]   Inactive, so search for inactive account manager.
[00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:13.280]   At least they didn't call it dead account manager.
[00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:16.000]   It seems morbid and nobody wants to think about it, but you make a will.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.880]   I mean, there comes a time when you...
[00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:18.880]   Sure.
[00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:23.040]   If you and I as we approach our later years, we used to think about this.
[00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:26.160]   Although it could happen to anybody as we know.
[00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:27.360]   And actually, I've thought about...
[00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:36.200]   I've got probably 30 gigs of data on Amazon's AWS and on a bunch of photo services and it's
[00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:38.040]   all password protected.
[00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:44.440]   If my family wanted to get any of the photos that I've taken for the last 15 years, get
[00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:48.840]   the actual original copies, they'd have to get into those accounts.
[00:28:48.840 --> 00:28:56.920]   So, I'm looking at it right now and you can either have it alert you before they delete
[00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:57.920]   it.
[00:28:57.920 --> 00:28:58.920]   Are you dead yet?
[00:28:58.920 --> 00:28:59.920]   Right.
[00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:00.920]   Dead yet?
[00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:01.920]   Right.
[00:29:01.920 --> 00:29:02.920]   Your timeout period could be a month, but you could set this...
[00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:04.240]   A month of no mail?
[00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:05.240]   Is that what it is?
[00:29:05.240 --> 00:29:13.480]   Of you not logging in and then you could set it to up to 18 months, then you can add notifications
[00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:15.800]   so you can notify to the data.
[00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:16.800]   You do this.
[00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:19.400]   Finally, you can just delete your whole account.
[00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:21.320]   It'll just get rid of it.
[00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:23.000]   See, I don't know if I want to do this.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:30.080]   Now, I use LastPass, so all I'd have to really do is give my Next of Kin my LastPass password.
[00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:35.880]   Or maybe an attorney or if your paranoid split it up, half to the attorney, half to your
[00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:41.000]   Next of Kin, put it in your will.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   And then in there, you could have a LastPass secure note that would say what your last
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:49.400]   wishes are.
[00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:52.520]   I think the inactive account manager is not quite right.
[00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:56.400]   So the idea mostly of that is to delete your account after a...
[00:29:56.400 --> 00:29:57.400]   No?
[00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:58.400]   No, no, no.
[00:29:58.400 --> 00:29:59.400]   That's an optional...
[00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:02.400]   You can optionally delete it, but you can notify all your contacts to give you...
[00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:03.400]   They're so funny.
[00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:06.680]   They say, "What happens to your account when you stop using it?"
[00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:09.040]   You can share here an interested contact.
[00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:11.000]   It's a nice way to put it.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:12.960]   You can give a loved one access, basically.
[00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:13.960]   Yeah.
[00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:14.960]   You can also share it with jail.
[00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:19.160]   Yeah, I might just be in jail.
[00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:20.160]   My account will time out...
[00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:21.960]   I don't think it's a jail setting.
[00:30:21.960 --> 00:30:25.960]   You could add up to 10 trusted friends or family members.
[00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:26.960]   This is good.
[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:27.960]   And you could...
[00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:28.960]   You know, I wonder if...
[00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:32.720]   Can you create an email that should be sent up upon your death?
[00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:33.720]   That's what I want.
[00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:34.800]   That would be a good feature.
[00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:39.640]   If you're reading this, it's because I haven't logged into Gmail in a long time.
[00:30:39.640 --> 00:30:41.640]   You know what I want, Leo?
[00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:44.160]   I want to tweet funeral.
[00:30:44.160 --> 00:30:45.960]   You can put memorial service.
[00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:46.960]   For me.
[00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:49.720]   Well, for you or for me too, I'll rely on...
[00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:51.280]   You would want that as well.
[00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:53.080]   We should get this all on record.
[00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:54.080]   Yes.
[00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:55.080]   It is on the record.
[00:30:55.080 --> 00:30:56.840]   It is on the record now.
[00:30:56.840 --> 00:30:57.840]   If death...
[00:30:57.840 --> 00:30:58.840]   Whoever...
[00:30:58.840 --> 00:30:59.840]   Actually, it's kind of depressing.
[00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:04.520]   Robin Williams did this with Louis C.K.
[00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:10.160]   If ever, whichever one of us pre-expires the other, the other will live tweet the funeral.
[00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:11.160]   Done.
[00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:18.160]   Oh, and don't...
[00:31:18.160 --> 00:31:19.160]   This is good, Dr. Mom.
[00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:23.440]   You're thinking she says, "Remind people not to deactivate the phone of the dead person
[00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:25.440]   in case of second-fath or authentication."
[00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:26.440]   That's right.
[00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:33.280]   Keep the dongle alive.
[00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:34.360]   I would imagine.
[00:31:34.360 --> 00:31:35.840]   I don't know.
[00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:36.840]   But there are a lot of...
[00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:40.520]   Look, when you pass away, there's a lot of cleanup anyway.
[00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:42.960]   But I would imagine a lot of loved ones.
[00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:45.200]   This is just one more area of cleanup.
[00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:46.920]   Facebook has a process.
[00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:52.960]   Facebook, actually, I think, handles it well, where if you pass away, your next-of-kin can
[00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:57.040]   notify Facebook and they'll take your Facebook page and turn it into a memorial.
[00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:58.040]   Right?
[00:31:58.040 --> 00:31:59.040]   Right.
[00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:00.040]   Yeah.
[00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:01.280]   Which is good because then it doesn't...
[00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:04.640]   This happened to me with this friend who passed away.
[00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:10.120]   Once it's memorialized, it doesn't show up in the sort of recommended things because at
[00:32:10.120 --> 00:32:15.880]   one point, this friend's page showed up and it was like, "Your friend's having a birthday."
[00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:17.960]   And I was thinking, "I'm pretty sure he's not."
[00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:21.600]   So maybe you could stop showing me that.
[00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:25.320]   I feel so bad for Robin's daughter.
[00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:26.320]   Yeah.
[00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:35.000]   There were trolls posting unpleasant images and terrible comments.
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:43.120]   Initially, she asked her supporters to report the trolls, but then she realized that was
[00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:48.640]   a mistake and decided it was better for her just to delete her social media accounts entirely.
[00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:49.640]   She did not.
[00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:51.240]   She posted on Twitter, "I'm sorry.
[00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:55.640]   I should have risen above deleting this from my devices for a good long time.
[00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:57.840]   Maybe forever time will tell goodbye."
[00:32:57.840 --> 00:32:58.840]   Can you imagine?
[00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:02.200]   Which is just off at a time where she could have received support and recognized the
[00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:04.320]   horrible, horrible people.
[00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:08.560]   And I'm sure most of the traffic was supportive and loving.
[00:33:08.560 --> 00:33:15.600]   But then these sad, bent people, it's just…
[00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:22.600]   No, and the other thing that happens, I don't want to give the guy any attention, but I
[00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:28.000]   had an episode this week of trolling where someone used my identity to go after somebody
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:30.480]   else infected my reputation.
[00:33:30.480 --> 00:33:38.680]   What's really equally disturbing is the people who then egg it on and take their responsibility
[00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:40.760]   for what they're doing.
[00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:41.760]   And I said this…
[00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:42.760]   Well, that's just trolling.
[00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:43.760]   And it's trolling too.
[00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:44.760]   Exactly.
[00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:49.800]   I said there was someone from a very large, important newspaper and a very large, important
[00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:56.480]   job there who was gleeful about this trolling of this person, this prominent person, this
[00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:58.480]   prominent person who thought that I was…
[00:33:58.480 --> 00:34:01.080]   Wait till it happens to you, big shot editor.
[00:34:01.080 --> 00:34:02.080]   Well, exactly.
[00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:08.560]   So I went back out today and I said, "Eggying on the troll is trolling itself.
[00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:11.280]   You're an accessory to the crime."
[00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:14.880]   And I said, "By the way, why don't you say the things that you just said straight to
[00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:18.120]   the face of this person and I put that person's Twitter handle in there.
[00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:19.120]   Come on, big shot.
[00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:22.440]   You want to talk about how you don't like the person and how you're going to encourage
[00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:23.440]   the troll?
[00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:24.440]   Go ahead.
[00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:25.440]   You have any bahungas?
[00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:28.440]   You know, it's just depressing.
[00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:29.440]   So sad.
[00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:39.760]   And unfortunately, a lot of these things start, you know, because it's seen as funny or it's
[00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:46.120]   people just looking for laws as they call it on 4chan and then it just escalates because
[00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:52.480]   everyone's trying to one up the other person and then eventually it just descends into,
[00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:55.800]   you know, the most horrible thing possible.
[00:34:55.800 --> 00:35:03.920]   That's where Gina was talking about this problem and with Twitter and I see some movement
[00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:08.880]   now and I think you wrote about this too, Matthew, or you linked to something about
[00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:11.080]   having shared blacklists.
[00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:12.840]   That could turn ugly too.
[00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:21.160]   But if the people you care about and you trust say, "I'm muting this person and I want
[00:35:21.160 --> 00:35:25.840]   to trust a list of who you two muted."
[00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:30.600]   And you might have personal individual reasons, but probably that's a good indicator that
[00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:37.080]   says, "Let's just give them no attention because the one fuel to the troll will attention."
[00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:41.320]   Even blocking them though is fueling them to some degree, right?
[00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:42.520]   If they know they've been wrong.
[00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:44.480]   I did write about that.
[00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:52.040]   So Glenn Fleischman wrote something for Boing Boing about this idea and I was discussing
[00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:57.520]   it with him and then wrote about it and it does have a lot going for it.
[00:35:57.520 --> 00:36:03.660]   I mean, the one big benefit is you don't have to rely on Twitter to figure out who to
[00:36:03.660 --> 00:36:05.160]   block or ban.
[00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:09.360]   You know, this is a much more sort of crowd sourced.
[00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:11.360]   Different groups can have their own shared lists.
[00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:15.400]   So it's not like a master list of who's blocked.
[00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:18.760]   It's different groups can come together and create their own.
[00:36:18.760 --> 00:36:24.760]   My fear is that those things can in themselves become tools of harassment.
[00:36:24.760 --> 00:36:35.040]   So for example, Vice someone wrote about being added to one of these block lists and I'm
[00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:37.120]   trying to remember her name now.
[00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:45.640]   Caroline Criato Perez, a British journalist, she was harassed on Twitter and was quite
[00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:48.240]   critical of the way Twitter handled it.
[00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:54.400]   She's actually on a blocked list because she posted something that someone thought was
[00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:55.880]   offensive to war.
[00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:56.880]   That's okay.
[00:36:56.880 --> 00:37:01.280]   I mean, it should be allowed to collude who they don't like.
[00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:02.280]   Sure.
[00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:03.280]   Sure they should.
[00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:09.520]   But my only fear is that it's, if it's those, I mean, it's a double edged sword, I guess
[00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:10.520]   is my point.
[00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:13.480]   And it doesn't, it just makes me nervous.
[00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:15.760]   I liberally use the block feature of Twitter.
[00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:16.760]   It's the best thing in the world.
[00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:19.760]   And yes, I know others are seeing these.
[00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:20.760]   I'm not.
[00:37:20.760 --> 00:37:22.840]   And as, you know, out of sight, Adam, I know.
[00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:29.400]   To make sure that was the problem with my episode is that I was a blocked person.
[00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:31.440]   And then I saw that there was notoriety going on.
[00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:35.360]   With having to be kind, reached a level of notoriety, I wouldn't have realized how this
[00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:36.360]   trolls victims.
[00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:37.360]   Yeah.
[00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:38.360]   So that's the argument against it.
[00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:40.280]   I was such a terrible person.
[00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:41.280]   Right.
[00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:44.960]   Knowing what's going on, that's the argument against blocking is your ignorance is bliss,
[00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:46.920]   but you don't know what's going on.
[00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:47.920]   Right.
[00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:52.760]   So I immediately tweeted to that prominent person and I said, this person's not me.
[00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:56.840]   And he was gracious and came back and acknowledged it so that I know he now know as somebody
[00:37:56.840 --> 00:38:01.560]   I know, somebody I met, I have common friends, a prominent person.
[00:38:01.560 --> 00:38:04.160]   And you know, it's just, it just goes over the floor.
[00:38:04.160 --> 00:38:05.160]   It's interesting.
[00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:07.080]   He knew, he understood immediately that what was going on.
[00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:08.080]   Right.
[00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:10.280]   No, no, that's the point.
[00:38:10.280 --> 00:38:11.280]   See, that's the problem.
[00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:15.200]   He was attacking, he was attacking back saying, you know, what a slime ball you are to say
[00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:17.040]   to his horrible things.
[00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:18.920]   And he makes it's me.
[00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:22.120]   And people say, well, you see that it's a, it's not the real accounts.
[00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:25.920]   Well, he's not, there's no obligation in him to go and look for my red, my green check.
[00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:29.800]   He's not sophisticated enough to know that this thing, these things happen.
[00:38:29.800 --> 00:38:30.800]   And it's not.
[00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:31.800]   But he's going after him.
[00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:32.800]   Yeah.
[00:38:32.800 --> 00:38:34.040]   When he was going after me, I just want to get away.
[00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:35.040]   I don't want any on me.
[00:38:35.040 --> 00:38:36.040]   Right.
[00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:37.840]   So I'm not going to go spend time to investigate.
[00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:38.840]   Right.
[00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:41.920]   That's, that's a bogus standard.
[00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:43.600]   And it was just playing out now trolling.
[00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:46.080]   It was somebody attacking this person.
[00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:48.440]   And this person thought it was me.
[00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:53.360]   And you know, I just, it goes over the line and I've just had it.
[00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:56.320]   I've, I've more of it had it now.
[00:38:56.320 --> 00:39:00.120]   And you know, fine, have fun and only accused of having no sense of humor and so on.
[00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:05.440]   But, but, you know, trolling people, somebody said that there's this prominent journalist
[00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:08.040]   said of this, no important person.
[00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:10.720]   Well, some people just, you know, deserve to be trolled.
[00:39:10.720 --> 00:39:13.320]   It's like saying someone deserved a hit and run.
[00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:16.720]   No one, no one deserves to be trolled.
[00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:17.720]   Full stop.
[00:39:17.720 --> 00:39:22.920]   But what do we do about it?
[00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:25.240]   I like this idea of collaborated lists.
[00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:29.960]   There, there's no facility that there's, there's no feature of Twitter that facilitates
[00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:33.080]   this, but we can easily just do it.
[00:39:33.080 --> 00:39:34.080]   I think Matthew's point.
[00:39:34.080 --> 00:39:37.560]   It shouldn't be universal black list because then, you know, you'll go.
[00:39:37.560 --> 00:39:41.720]   No, but if Glenn and Matthew want to send me a list of people that you don't follow,
[00:39:41.720 --> 00:39:44.800]   I'll send you a list of people I don't follow.
[00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:46.600]   That's a good start, right?
[00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:47.600]   Yeah.
[00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:52.880]   And you see there's a, there's a service called the block bot, which is the, the, the
[00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:54.640]   sort of most developed.
[00:39:54.640 --> 00:40:00.760]   And then there are a couple of other projects that are trying to do this similar thing.
[00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:08.120]   So you could share a block list and it would integrate with Twitter or with TweetTech.
[00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:13.040]   And so if you agreed to opt into this list, then certain people would automatically be
[00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:14.040]   blocked.
[00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:18.600]   I always, I always look for a technological solution to these kinds of problems that were
[00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:22.480]   spawned, in fact, by the new technologies that allowed people to do things.
[00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:25.120]   They couldn't do, couldn't do as effectively before.
[00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:31.480]   I mean, I'm sure there've always been trolls, but that's, that's a good way to handle it.
[00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:32.240]   Let's, let's, you know,
[00:40:32.240 --> 00:40:37.000]   another way is, is on comments on disgusts.
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:42.080]   And I think on WordPress as well, when you see the, they'll, they'll give you a high
[00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:43.560]   level of suspicion index.
[00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:46.240]   You know, I almost want that.
[00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:50.400]   If I see somebody who's being an airhole in Twitter, and if I can see a little mark that
[00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:53.000]   says, how many of your friends blocking this person?
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   I'm joining the block.
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:03.960]   That sounds like, this sounds like a really well done idea here.
[00:41:03.960 --> 00:41:05.920]   And it has a list of a lot of blocks.
[00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:07.960]   Oh, you could see who's blocked on here.
[00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:08.960]   Holy cow.
[00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:09.960]   That's the problem.
[00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:11.600]   This is, this is, this is a fan.
[00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:15.000]   I mean, you're never, it's so easy to create a new account on Twitter.
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:16.000]   Oops.
[00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:17.000]   Sorry.
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   I just closed it.
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   Sorry.
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:26.620]   Twitter that this is only of limited value but this is also a universal list right right
[00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:29.700]   that's not yeah I got a problem with that because because that can be gained so
[00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:33.920]   easily condition for block people just because they don't like Jeff Jarvis yeah
[00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:41.980]   right I want to block people that don't like me right all right well a good
[00:41:41.980 --> 00:41:46.640]   conversation as usual we are this is the this is the show for deep philosophical
[00:41:46.640 --> 00:41:52.720]   discussions oh TCR death and and trolling geez and the and the confluence
[00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:57.540]   thereof the intersection of death and trolling that's something I didn't think
[00:41:57.540 --> 00:42:02.080]   we'd be talking internet here's the internet and nutshell let's talk about
[00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:06.620]   Chromebooks yeah I mean I don't know if you've noticed but I'm using a Lenovo
[00:42:06.620 --> 00:42:11.720]   Chromebook right now this is something we're reviewing huh how much is that
[00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:16.160]   one do you know I you know this is one of the cheap ones the only difference is
[00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:22.080]   it has a touchscreen which is okay it's not the problem is with with cheap
[00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:27.440]   hardware it's not responsive enough to be a satisfactory experience and so what
[00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:30.400]   I did I sat down with it last night I was using it and then I switched back to
[00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:34.240]   the pixel just to experience and and this is why I think you like Chromebook so
[00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:39.760]   much Jeff Jarvis you're using the pixel yeah that you can't even buy any more if
[00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:43.200]   even if you want to spend twelve hundred bucks you can't let's first
[00:42:43.200 --> 00:42:48.240]   of us it's still for sale oh okay twelve hundred bucks right with LTE
[00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:58.560]   1500 more than a MacBook Pro but it's a damn fine machine and I didn't have to
[00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:02.640]   buy any more software for it don't forget well as an example we were looking for
[00:43:02.640 --> 00:43:07.080]   a machine that had keys that light up the only Chromebook with keys that light
[00:43:07.080 --> 00:43:16.320]   up is the pixel why do you need key to the light up I don't know the person
[00:43:16.320 --> 00:43:21.920]   likes to take the dark yeah okay this is I find it really handy Lisa wants to
[00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:27.080]   give a Chromebook is a gift to an adult friend and that's one of the criteria
[00:43:27.080 --> 00:43:33.800]   oh you shouldn't leave you I already have one we feel that Jeff needs more
[00:43:33.800 --> 00:43:37.720]   Chromebooks but the problem is right now that except for the pixel all of these
[00:43:37.720 --> 00:43:45.720]   are pretty much cheap netbooks and you don't have a great experience the Acer
[00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:51.680]   was this new this new Acer 13 I it's not available yet I pre-ordered it it's
[00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:56.840]   1080p 11 hours battery life that's the best I've ever seen on a Chromebook it's
[00:43:56.840 --> 00:44:01.440]   not that expensive 379 that's the higher end is it two seven nine that's the
[00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:05.960]   higher end with the four gigs of RAM and it's using this new Tegra K1 processor
[00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:10.800]   which is it's not only 64 bit but desktop class I mean it's it's a fast
[00:44:10.800 --> 00:44:15.000]   process the video shows it's pretty fast off yeah it's supposed to I never
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:20.680]   never I mean even this less expensive it's running on a seller on is is snappy
[00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:24.120]   enough it's just the touchscreen it's not that snappy the problem I had in my
[00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:29.000]   original Samsung and and they've come to but the two gigs just it just it just
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:32.880]   loaded molasses to some point for four gigs somebody email me to a fan of the
[00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:37.120]   show email me yesterday I just said four gigs for that makes a difference yeah
[00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:42.040]   yeah it does although we have we bought for Michael for School of Chromebook the
[00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:48.440]   Acer C 720 which is widely recommended and it's now it's fine for him he doesn't
[00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:55.720]   know the difference he watches PewDiePie on YouTube though I mean yeah but I
[00:44:55.760 --> 00:45:01.360]   mean he's used in MacBook he's used he's got a Mac Pro to play games on I mean I
[00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:04.080]   was talking to a good friend of mine today and she was she she they bought
[00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:08.160]   one for her daughter in schools and high school and just said the advantage of
[00:45:08.160 --> 00:45:11.360]   number one if it's of a computer got stolen no big deal of things in the
[00:45:11.360 --> 00:45:15.040]   cloud number two they forgot to put the thing on blackboard or whatever that was
[00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:19.240]   nope it's all in the cloud there's no I left my homework at school it's just
[00:45:19.240 --> 00:45:26.200]   for a student it makes a lot of difference I think mm-hmm yeah so I'm
[00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:31.000]   tempted by the 13 it's just because I want that yeah the the the 279 version
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:34.820]   has 13 hour battery promised yeah that amazing three hundred seventy nine
[00:45:34.820 --> 00:45:41.400]   version with the with a greater screen as as eleven hours promised Wow but I
[00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:46.360]   that's that's that's a long flight I want the battery life I mean if you're
[00:45:46.360 --> 00:45:50.160]   gonna use so we've thought we've said that we've we've issued the call before
[00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:54.120]   so people need to do mid-range Chromebooks pixel I think everyone
[00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:57.400]   agrees is too much it's hard to recommend somebody spend 1299 on a
[00:45:57.400 --> 00:46:01.920]   Chromebook but I would spend 600 $700 for I think you could do a good one for
[00:46:01.920 --> 00:46:08.080]   five I really do I don't think you need to get that expensive well if you took
[00:46:08.080 --> 00:46:10.460]   all feet you know what does a Chromebook give you it gives you a touch
[00:46:10.460 --> 00:46:19.300]   screen you do LTE yeah maybe for that 600 it gives you high res yeah you need
[00:46:19.300 --> 00:46:23.420]   to have a GP I think you need to have a better GPU because I think you need to
[00:46:23.420 --> 00:46:30.820]   have the the screen be responsive yeah I don't even know what this thing is
[00:46:30.820 --> 00:46:35.460]   built on what is the pixel built on I I think it's an i5 but I'm not sure actually
[00:46:35.460 --> 00:46:39.700]   I don't know it wouldn't mean to me anyway so like look me looking out of the
[00:46:39.700 --> 00:46:52.380]   car you got four on the floor and a her shifter in there so I got a question
[00:46:52.380 --> 00:47:02.460]   for you yes I opened it oh one plus you have a question yes yeah I do I do I
[00:47:02.460 --> 00:47:09.500]   went through it took me two thirds of a day to get this working what why
[00:47:09.500 --> 00:47:13.540]   trying to get the I went to the Apple Store it was the wonderful Alex Hugo
[00:47:13.540 --> 00:47:17.660]   who's it was a fan of twig wait wait you took it to an Apple Store I mean I
[00:47:17.660 --> 00:47:23.460]   mean it no there would be your problem I would think yeah go to an AT&T store
[00:47:23.460 --> 00:47:29.380]   and a guy looked up the what is it AVN APN APN APN
[00:47:29.380 --> 00:47:33.820]   mine worked right out of the box you had a problem with the well yeah it
[00:47:33.820 --> 00:47:36.940]   didn't work and then and then so I don't there was there were change I don't know
[00:47:36.940 --> 00:47:39.620]   what finally got working a change of some of this and then Alex wonderful
[00:47:39.620 --> 00:47:43.180]   wonderful twig fan who's helped me before is rescue you before you weren't
[00:47:43.180 --> 00:47:46.700]   getting data because you had the wrong APA APN settings well we thought that
[00:47:46.700 --> 00:47:50.340]   was it and then still wasn't getting it and then it turned out my account was
[00:47:50.340 --> 00:47:56.780]   not provisioned for 4G I don't know how that happened what are you are you using
[00:47:56.780 --> 00:48:01.820]   a five an X is five next is five so then so now okay so I put the same in and now
[00:48:01.820 --> 00:48:08.220]   now it's working but here's the problem I think it doesn't fail down below 4G for
[00:48:08.220 --> 00:48:14.180]   data no it does Jeff you're you I don't know you have your problems that are
[00:48:14.180 --> 00:48:20.540]   unique to you I'm I have a cli have a day I have had this I have had this on
[00:48:20.540 --> 00:48:29.340]   3G I have had this on 2G today is it a AT&T or T-Mobile AT&T oh so it's the
[00:48:29.340 --> 00:48:38.380]   I think they're trolling you though the cloud I live in Leo it's dark you live
[00:48:38.380 --> 00:48:44.340]   in a dark cloud I don't it's not just over my head I'm in the dark cloud well
[00:48:44.340 --> 00:48:48.020]   first of all you could have screwed things up by changing the APN settings
[00:48:48.020 --> 00:48:52.140]   mine work out of the box I think it's okay what is your a what's what's the
[00:48:52.140 --> 00:48:56.380]   name of your APM I'll have to figure that out go under mobile networks and then
[00:48:56.380 --> 00:49:05.220]   access point names preferred network type 4G recommended I have WAP dot singular
[00:49:05.220 --> 00:49:14.340]   which is correct by the works on the WAP yeah your mistake was trying to fix
[00:49:14.340 --> 00:49:22.540]   something that wasn't broken oh yeah WAP dot singular that's the one that
[00:49:22.540 --> 00:49:28.820]   works well it doesn't mine my username is WAP and singular you're all the same
[00:49:28.820 --> 00:49:34.260]   you're all the same GRS calm so it does yours fails down to 3G I'll have full
[00:49:34.260 --> 00:49:41.100]   bars at 3G but no 4G and then no data and even says preferred network type 4G
[00:49:41.100 --> 00:49:46.780]   3G 2 I did that too I did that too I don't know I think I think it's me it's
[00:49:46.780 --> 00:49:52.460]   the other the remain messed with you dude there's the other issue with one
[00:49:52.460 --> 00:49:57.300]   plus other than I if you couldn't get it working by I'm gonna buy it I'm gonna
[00:49:57.300 --> 00:50:00.660]   buy it and he was very nice about it is a twig fan and he said not but I'm not
[00:50:00.660 --> 00:50:04.060]   trying to you know live on your misfortune Jeff go talk to Jean I try to
[00:50:04.060 --> 00:50:08.380]   get it working but if not many just tweet it yesterday and I'm not so sure I
[00:50:08.380 --> 00:50:13.020]   want anything from then did you see the sexist campaign they were doing yeah
[00:50:13.020 --> 00:50:21.460]   yeah I got something to say about that okay hit it they and in their defense I
[00:50:21.460 --> 00:50:27.580]   agree it's a bad idea what they said is you know the whole way one plus has
[00:50:27.580 --> 00:50:32.140]   worked which is weird to begin with is that you have to somehow either participate
[00:50:32.140 --> 00:50:36.300]   in a contest or a requested invite or get an invite from an existing customer
[00:50:36.300 --> 00:50:41.460]   to get this phone it's in very very short supply the reason we all use it
[00:50:41.460 --> 00:50:45.880]   and like it is because is a very high-end flagship phone for 350 bucks 64
[00:50:45.880 --> 00:50:50.780]   gigabytes so of storage so that's you know it's a good price for a very nice
[00:50:50.780 --> 00:50:55.020]   phone five and a half inch phone the they've gotten in trouble their first
[00:50:55.020 --> 00:50:59.460]   contest that was dumb they asked people to destroy the phone send them a video
[00:50:59.460 --> 00:51:02.300]   and then people pointed out what you're destroying something it's perfectly
[00:51:02.300 --> 00:51:04.420]   useful it could be handed on to somebody who doesn't have a phone that could
[00:51:04.420 --> 00:51:09.420]   use a phone throw it out the garbage and pollute the app yeah that's a bad so
[00:51:09.420 --> 00:51:14.220]   they then oh yeah we're stupid sorry what we should have done is say you know I
[00:51:14.220 --> 00:51:17.980]   don't know they changed they modified the contest so the most recent contest I
[00:51:17.980 --> 00:51:26.340]   agree tone deaf said ladies first send us a picture of yourself did it have to
[00:51:26.340 --> 00:51:31.220]   be with your old phone but send us a picture with yourself and you as this
[00:51:31.220 --> 00:51:34.660]   is another contest right and you will put put you in a drawing for one of these
[00:51:34.660 --> 00:51:38.180]   phones or whatever no no no no no no they had to write something on their body
[00:51:38.180 --> 00:51:42.820]   and then we're gonna take I didn't hear the right something on your body and then
[00:51:42.820 --> 00:51:46.540]   we're gonna vote on oh I'm sorry you're right then that's hard
[00:51:46.540 --> 00:51:52.820]   judacious one plus no no no I miss understood I didn't know that they had to
[00:51:52.820 --> 00:51:57.620]   do something more than just send a send a cell oh yeah yeah yeah write something
[00:51:57.620 --> 00:52:02.420]   on their body or they can hold a sign but what if you're gonna be voted on
[00:52:02.420 --> 00:52:09.820]   clearly the less you wore the better let me read let me that's why I didn't see
[00:52:09.820 --> 00:52:15.300]   that okay then then I then there's no logo on a piece of paper or their body
[00:52:15.300 --> 00:52:22.900]   guess who's gonna win and then the top 50 most liked women in the forums a t-shirt
[00:52:22.900 --> 00:52:26.940]   we're a t-shirt and the opportunity to pay full price for the phone oh yeah
[00:52:26.940 --> 00:52:29.860]   you're right nevermind yeah that's bad that's bad
[00:52:29.860 --> 00:52:36.020]   nevermind would it have been okay if they said ladies first sent us a picture
[00:52:36.020 --> 00:52:41.780]   and we'll have a drawing for an invite and a t-shirt drawing yes drawing I think
[00:52:41.780 --> 00:52:46.740]   it's having having the forums vote was a mystery contest yeah beauty contest
[00:52:46.740 --> 00:52:51.460]   right your logo no no no no I miss unders I didn't realize you had to do
[00:52:51.460 --> 00:52:56.020]   that that's ridiculous and by the way you don't get a free phone you just get
[00:52:56.020 --> 00:53:03.380]   the opportunity to buy a phone right which is already weird this is like the
[00:53:03.380 --> 00:53:06.660]   American apparel of phone company remember though they're in China maybe
[00:53:06.660 --> 00:53:16.180]   there's cultural a cultural gulf you're being so charitable I like the phone
[00:53:16.180 --> 00:53:20.180]   it's a night it feels good it doesn't feel too big the sauce is about right
[00:53:20.180 --> 00:53:24.220]   there's been a lot of backlash I think a lot of the back and by the way this is a
[00:53:24.220 --> 00:53:27.980]   good one lady sends a picture of herself flipping them off with the one plus
[00:53:27.980 --> 00:53:29.540]   left
[00:53:29.540 --> 00:53:34.140]   I'm not gonna show it I'm not gonna show it
[00:53:34.140 --> 00:53:38.380]   and she writes she writes something on her hand yes that's why I'm not gonna
[00:53:38.380 --> 00:53:44.380]   show it yeah yeah that's that's rude nevermind but you know they've also
[00:53:44.380 --> 00:53:50.060]   incurred a lot of wrath just because how they're doing this well Tony saying
[00:53:50.060 --> 00:53:54.700]   and on the on the rundown cultural difference anyway
[00:53:54.700 --> 00:53:59.420]   Tony's Taiwanese yeah he says they're trying to get more female owners
[00:53:59.420 --> 00:54:09.020]   cultural difference yeah but Tony the beauty contest they did say no nudity
[00:54:09.020 --> 00:54:13.100]   well but that's kind of that's the far end of the boundary anything up to that
[00:54:13.100 --> 00:54:20.220]   you're gonna get more votes no you're right you're right
[00:54:20.220 --> 00:54:26.220]   but it's a nice photo the battery your right is phenomenal yeah I think your
[00:54:26.220 --> 00:54:29.260]   problems are unique to you and I think your big mistake was bringing it to the
[00:54:29.260 --> 00:54:34.220]   AT&T store I don't think I wouldn't work it wouldn't work well the guy at AT&T
[00:54:34.220 --> 00:54:38.460]   store should have done what Alex did dear Alex thank you Alex who was by the
[00:54:38.460 --> 00:54:42.940]   way just a fan who works in a store in Illinois yeah and and he helps me out
[00:54:42.940 --> 00:54:47.820]   because I need help yeah but the guy at the AT&T store that I went to here
[00:54:47.820 --> 00:54:51.340]   should have checked my account I guess but it wasn't until his provision
[00:54:51.340 --> 00:54:55.580]   report unless it was a provision report gee I got no data well that's something
[00:54:55.580 --> 00:55:00.140]   wrong with your account it sounds like I could by the end there were so many
[00:55:00.140 --> 00:55:03.500]   variables I couldn't figure it out five I'm very asked five to know where gee
[00:55:03.500 --> 00:55:10.220]   right I have Lenin on my what screen you can I have why do you have Lenin on
[00:55:10.220 --> 00:55:13.260]   your screen I don't know marks and angles on my
[00:55:13.260 --> 00:55:18.460]   you've got me yeah I just decided what that you really want to rub it in huh
[00:55:18.460 --> 00:55:25.500]   yeah now we know your real sympathies I lost trip to Berlin you know uh when
[00:55:25.500 --> 00:55:33.420]   we were uh where were we we were in LA there is a there the the
[00:55:33.420 --> 00:55:37.420]   lat they took all the statues of Lenin down in Russia but there's a statue of
[00:55:37.420 --> 00:55:42.620]   Lenin in a way really the caveat to point this out he said he was the only
[00:55:42.620 --> 00:55:45.740]   statue of Lenin then don't have many more he was Armenian he wasn't
[00:55:45.740 --> 00:55:50.780]   happy about the Russians so uh mr. Dark Cloud
[00:55:50.780 --> 00:56:00.300]   good news is that they are upgrading this now to 4.4.4 and they're fixing
[00:56:00.300 --> 00:56:03.820]   a lot of the issues one of the issues with the one plus that Jason had when
[00:56:03.820 --> 00:56:07.180]   he reviewed it is it was turning itself on in his pocket
[00:56:07.180 --> 00:56:10.700]   and they've uh they they they realized that was a problem they fixed they fixed
[00:56:10.700 --> 00:56:13.820]   that in the upper they there's a significant update coming
[00:56:13.820 --> 00:56:17.900]   any minute now many of the many how are you gonna get updated just get
[00:56:17.900 --> 00:56:22.380]   it automatically let you know okay
[00:56:22.380 --> 00:56:27.020]   it's it's I would just say this I don't I think that the battery
[00:56:27.020 --> 00:56:31.660]   goes way beyond the Nexus 5 but as a whole it's not a
[00:56:31.660 --> 00:56:35.180]   one of leap past the Nexus 5
[00:56:35.180 --> 00:56:39.420]   okay um cameras are going on leap past the Nexus 5
[00:56:39.420 --> 00:56:43.100]   screens in the next one I'm leaving the speeds are going to leave
[00:56:43.100 --> 00:56:49.020]   I'll just say this a a non-twiggy kind of person asked me today who's just
[00:56:49.020 --> 00:56:52.540]   whose iPhone is dying and I said go Android and she said what
[00:56:52.540 --> 00:56:56.060]   phone should I get and I thought and I'm not me in the fact that you can't get this
[00:56:56.060 --> 00:57:00.700]   but I said get a Nexus 5 oh I wouldn't get a Nexus 5 now it's a
[00:57:00.700 --> 00:57:07.500]   year old that's crazy talk excuse me that's crazy talk
[00:57:07.500 --> 00:57:14.540]   yeah I mean I would say the M8 is very good the lgg3 I hear good things about
[00:57:14.540 --> 00:57:18.940]   uh the x is 5 is is old but you saw by the way that they have now
[00:57:18.940 --> 00:57:23.980]   paired down the play editions to two yes I saw that on the play store what
[00:57:23.980 --> 00:57:31.740]   are the two it's the Moto G and the what is it lg I think
[00:57:31.740 --> 00:57:37.580]   there you go right there those are the gce versions
[00:57:37.580 --> 00:57:42.780]   uh that looks like an HTC one and then the Moto G or the lgg lg
[00:57:42.780 --> 00:57:46.380]   the m8 is still great and I think the google play edition of the m8 would be
[00:57:46.380 --> 00:57:50.540]   also an excellent choice but you know the good news about the Nexus 5 is cheap
[00:57:51.340 --> 00:57:55.420]   can you get it still are they still selling it or is it out of stock so
[00:57:55.420 --> 00:57:59.820]   they're right there it's still there yes there the price is right on that
[00:57:59.820 --> 00:58:03.980]   I just it's a year old phone I and I feel like there are better choices
[00:58:03.980 --> 00:58:08.540]   out there Chad would you buy a new Nexus 5 yours is cracked no
[00:58:08.540 --> 00:58:13.340]   schmooker no I'm in the same thing as if you wait you know basically unless someone
[00:58:13.340 --> 00:58:18.700]   needs a phone today yeah uh then I would suggest the Nexus 5 or the m8
[00:58:18.700 --> 00:58:22.700]   there's gonna be great stuff coming out that's the thing is if you can wait until
[00:58:22.700 --> 00:58:26.460]   the end of September you're gonna be so much more happier with the selection
[00:58:26.460 --> 00:58:32.060]   and where is the Nexus not wouldn't be the six because uh well could be the six
[00:58:32.060 --> 00:58:38.940]   where is the next Nexus it's there's been rumors yeah rumors that's all um
[00:58:38.940 --> 00:58:44.300]   this is what we know not good rumors not reliable rumors all right let's uh let's
[00:58:44.300 --> 00:58:46.700]   take a break we'll come back with more I actually have gonna do the chain we're

[00:59:45.580 --> 00:59:51.020]   by gender by the number of people or no people in the image and they're all royalty free which
[00:59:51.020 --> 00:59:58.860]   means that's your phone right there they're all royalty free what did you search for broken phone

[01:00:54.780 --> 01:01:00.060]   shutter stock dot com all right let's try this we could jeff you want to we could tag team the
[01:01:00.060 --> 01:01:06.940]   changelog together you want to do that dandy all right play the trumpets the google changelog
[01:01:06.940 --> 01:01:14.220]   time to see what's new new features on the google verse let's why you take that first one
[01:01:14.220 --> 01:01:23.100]   since you know it's only one i know i put it in there so now um mother board says that uh
[01:01:23.100 --> 01:01:34.620]   legally satellites are now allowed to get face the res to go from 25 to um uh go to 25 centimeter
[01:01:34.620 --> 01:01:40.220]   resolution twice as detailed as the previous limit of 50 centimeter you know just relax restrictions
[01:01:40.220 --> 01:01:45.660]   so the government images are that clear but they've never allowed google to publish them
[01:01:45.660 --> 01:01:51.260]   right so that so the joke here was watch out google's will soon see your face from the sky
[01:01:51.260 --> 01:01:55.500]   actually though that's only if you're looking at that i figure what's going to see is your bald spot
[01:01:55.500 --> 01:02:02.780]   yeah my uncle you know i was thinking yeah say some guy talk i was thinking about this the other day
[01:02:02.780 --> 01:02:08.620]   yeah i'm i'm in a i'm in one of the skyscrapers in new york as we have them and i'm looking out and
[01:02:08.620 --> 01:02:17.500]   you see all the what us where would be the underlife of buildings right the the tanks and the air
[01:02:17.500 --> 01:02:21.740]   conditioners and the ugly stuff that's weird how we don't have aesthetic requirements
[01:02:21.740 --> 01:02:28.940]   for the pops of buildings because now we have drones and satellites maybe we will yeah i think
[01:02:28.940 --> 01:02:38.060]   we need prettier tops of buildings i think people should plant flowers on their buildings
[01:02:38.060 --> 01:02:43.740]   yes i think we need a top-down beautification campaign so it's open to be the lady bird johnson
[01:02:43.740 --> 01:02:48.620]   of the sky oh you crack me up oh my gosh all right lady bird
[01:02:48.620 --> 01:02:54.620]   the well i think you should make keep america beautiful and make the rooftops beautiful
[01:02:54.620 --> 01:03:02.540]   and and make the nsa happy and make the nsa happy so google changed things with gmail uh a little
[01:03:02.540 --> 01:03:09.740]   while ago they added support for non-latin characters and email addresses um you but you
[01:03:09.740 --> 01:03:14.380]   can't create an account that way but at least if somebody sends you a uh an email and
[01:03:14.380 --> 01:03:20.300]   syrrhillic uh you can you can get it however it turns out scammers are starting to use this
[01:03:20.300 --> 01:03:27.580]   by using non-native letters to fool you into trusting a message contents so uh they're now
[01:03:27.580 --> 01:03:34.220]   tossing out email with odd combinations of letters that look like they represent fishing attempts
[01:03:34.860 --> 01:03:41.260]   so if they use a let's say an alpha instead of an a in the word bank uh you know
[01:03:41.260 --> 01:03:47.740]   bat bonk of america you you you'll be able to uh you'll be you'll know and google will
[01:03:47.740 --> 01:03:52.060]   they'll know it more importantly and they'll filter that out uh other email providers are
[01:03:52.060 --> 01:03:57.420]   gonna have to do the same thing yeah bonk of america and i guess there's some you know code
[01:03:57.420 --> 01:04:01.340]   characters that just don't appear on the screen you could even have invisible characters stuck in
[01:04:01.340 --> 01:04:06.460]   there but of course the computer knows a computer can see that oh my god they're scanning my mail
[01:04:06.460 --> 01:04:18.620]   for non-romen characters oh my god uh i'm a little android pardon me go ahead we didn't rehearse
[01:04:18.620 --> 01:04:26.540]   we should have rehearsed go ahead now um it takes two guys for place jina um and not well at once
[01:04:27.260 --> 01:04:35.980]   no says that uh google play music is quietly uh introduced a four device limit per account per year
[01:04:35.980 --> 01:04:49.020]   uh no no four device deactivation right so right you have ten devices okay still that hasn't changed
[01:04:49.020 --> 01:04:54.700]   oh so you can't switch eyes but remember you for a for a while one brief shining moment
[01:04:55.660 --> 01:05:01.980]   you were able to deactivate it will anytime you wanted so um you have 20 devices yeah
[01:05:01.980 --> 01:05:08.140]   well no you can have 10 devices but if you got to 10 and which i do all the time this hits me a
[01:05:08.140 --> 01:05:13.260]   lot because i have so many phones um and i try to activate a new phone on google play music and
[01:05:13.260 --> 01:05:18.780]   they say well you've got 10 devices well i can just easily de-off some old devices now you'll only
[01:05:18.780 --> 01:05:29.500]   be able to do this uh four times a year so quickly de-authorize everything it's retroactive oh crap
[01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:34.140]   so even if you've de-authorized stuff uh already it's uh taken effect most people this probably
[01:05:34.140 --> 01:05:40.220]   doesn't bother but it it really affects me because i have so many uh devices and you know like this
[01:05:40.220 --> 01:05:45.020]   notebook this new chrome book i'll have it for five minutes you know for a week to review it and
[01:05:45.020 --> 01:05:49.900]   then send it back so i authorize it for google play music and now i can't de-authorize it so be very
[01:05:49.900 --> 01:05:54.540]   i guess the real uh take away from this is be very careful when you authorize it because you're
[01:05:54.540 --> 01:06:00.380]   not going to be able to de-authorize more than four a year and i would guess because yes go ahead
[01:06:00.380 --> 01:06:05.580]   i haven't used google play music i don't use any of the streamers oh i love it what which one do you
[01:06:05.580 --> 01:06:10.700]   look best yeah it's great well there's some really good choice effect you know we were playing with
[01:06:10.700 --> 01:06:15.660]   beats music the other day then apples uh newest acquisition they actually do a very interesting
[01:06:15.660 --> 01:06:24.460]   job it depends what you're looking for basically all of them spotify uh beats uh rdio rhapsody
[01:06:24.460 --> 01:06:30.380]   google play amazon play had the access to the same 20 million song libraries for as i could tell
[01:06:30.380 --> 01:06:35.420]   it pretty much the same there's a few areas where maybe they might have an exclusive on one artist
[01:06:35.420 --> 01:06:39.580]   or whatever but it's pretty much the same music prices are all the same ten bucks a month that's
[01:06:39.580 --> 01:06:44.620]   pretty much the standard it's more the features so one of the things i like about google is i can
[01:06:44.620 --> 01:06:49.740]   upload my entire collection so uh up to what is it what is it 25 000 songs i can't remember what the
[01:06:49.740 --> 01:06:55.500]   limit is i think so yeah but the nice that's nice because i have stuff in my collection that isn't
[01:06:55.500 --> 01:07:02.540]   on google play music isn't in that 20 million song set so i have access to that and of course i have
[01:07:02.540 --> 01:07:07.340]   access if i pay you know the ten bucks a month to every other song and i can listen they have very
[01:07:07.340 --> 01:07:13.100]   good radio i think google i really like google i oh careful careful you i i'm not going to use
[01:07:13.100 --> 01:07:18.220]   the key sera hydra again so might as well be i guess you should rise it i i'm at nine so you see
[01:07:18.220 --> 01:07:22.300]   where we are you see the problem yeah this is people like you and me and i don't review as many
[01:07:22.300 --> 01:07:28.460]   phones as you do and i'm hitting my limit uh this is absurd and i wish i wish there's a way that i
[01:07:28.460 --> 01:07:33.900]   could call and say uh my situation's a little different than the normal person so apple has to say i
[01:07:33.900 --> 01:07:38.300]   think there's a music industry that enforces this apple has the same kind of restriction
[01:07:38.300 --> 01:07:44.940]   once a year you can deauthorize everything but if you call them sometimes they'll be nicer about it
[01:07:44.940 --> 01:07:49.500]   audible does the same thing i think these are restrictions placed by the content creators not
[01:07:49.500 --> 01:07:55.660]   by these companies wouldn't surprise me yeah so i like google play music uh on the other hand
[01:07:55.660 --> 01:08:01.500]   amazon music is also a good choice their radio selection is not very good they're the they're
[01:08:01.500 --> 01:08:06.860]   amazon prime music which is free if you're a prime member has a much fewer than a million songs in
[01:08:06.860 --> 01:08:11.820]   the in the library so it's not very good the other reason i like google play music sorry i
[01:08:11.820 --> 01:08:19.900]   buttoned in a lot this episode uh you can do radio a lot easier you can do radio off of playlists
[01:08:19.900 --> 01:08:25.980]   which amazon still hasn't quite nailed down also amazon's interface is very cludgy uh you have to
[01:08:25.980 --> 01:08:31.500]   download a little application to upload uh music and now google has done away with that on their
[01:08:31.500 --> 01:08:36.620]   service you can do it just from the browser oh but yeah see i want i still use a google plugin
[01:08:36.620 --> 01:08:40.620]   because i want it to be running all the time so that when i add new music it just up yeah you can
[01:08:40.620 --> 01:08:45.100]   do that as well yeah i just find that and then also i mean once once you've added your music to the
[01:08:45.100 --> 01:08:51.100]   google verse any google app that's going to tap into music is going to tap into all access right and
[01:08:51.100 --> 01:08:55.900]   so just being part of the ecosystem is really nice also if you have a chromecast google play
[01:08:55.900 --> 01:09:01.340]   music with chromecast and they recently added sonos support so as a sonos user then now it's
[01:09:01.340 --> 01:09:07.740]   a no-brainer because i can cast music from my google play music to my sonos that's awesome
[01:09:07.740 --> 01:09:13.260]   so uh i it all in all oh and there's one other thing that that makes google play music really
[01:09:13.260 --> 01:09:18.780]   awesome they have a little dice widget so you tap the whoops let's go back to my home page
[01:09:18.780 --> 01:09:25.100]   you tap go back to the home page tap the dice widget it rolls the dice and then picks a random
[01:09:25.100 --> 01:09:30.140]   song for you actually this is the i'm feeling lucky radio i like i like that
[01:09:30.140 --> 01:09:37.500]   um also if you use android it makes sense to use google play music because you could do things like
[01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:43.660]   uh you know i'm uh listen to del shannon and it will play del shannon um oh i guess it'll do that
[01:09:43.660 --> 01:09:49.820]   with spotify yeah i can do it with the only thing i found but yeah it's kind of automatic right
[01:09:49.820 --> 01:09:54.060]   out of the box you don't have to roll yeah you don't have to tell it what your default is if you
[01:09:54.060 --> 01:10:01.580]   have all access the only thing i found i was assuming when i did the you know play me a uh station based
[01:10:01.580 --> 01:10:07.340]   on this album or based on this thing from my music that the algorithm would be a bit better
[01:10:08.220 --> 01:10:14.540]   sort of suggesting similar songs that i know you can thumbs up thumbs down them yeah but i i
[01:10:14.540 --> 01:10:21.100]   think i had one like prodigy song in there and then all of a sudden it was it was recommending
[01:10:21.100 --> 01:10:27.500]   every screamo death metal you know and i had to just keep saying no no no no no no well the good
[01:10:27.500 --> 01:10:32.700]   news is you have unlimited skips which you don't have on pandaurea so i had at least that i think all
[01:10:32.700 --> 01:10:37.740]   of these recommendation systems uh have failings of it pandaurea always sneaks a Beatles song in no
[01:10:37.740 --> 01:10:46.300]   matter what why because they have the Beatles catalog because they have it um so it's playing
[01:10:46.300 --> 01:10:52.540]   bob willis in the texas playboy's sugar moon which is i think a really excellent i'm feeling lucky
[01:10:52.540 --> 01:11:01.820]   choice right there now i probably wouldn't uh think i could thumbs up indicating a lot more of that
[01:11:01.820 --> 01:11:08.700]   i think i i pick google play music but we're in this is this is this week in google i think it's
[01:11:08.700 --> 01:11:13.820]   really well done i think all the radios have that drawn even though they're not sponsored
[01:11:13.820 --> 01:11:20.700]   on the show for a while i actually do listen to audible a lot not it was awesome this week i got
[01:11:20.700 --> 01:11:30.220]   all unhappy with amazon because when i buy kindle books yeah i have i have a decent sized little gift
[01:11:30.220 --> 01:11:38.380]   count which has been gifts over time plus things i've earned from amazon stuff and it insists upon
[01:11:38.380 --> 01:11:43.900]   taking out of that for kindles i'm doing some work right now and these are business books i don't
[01:11:43.900 --> 01:11:49.340]   want to use my gift money for that uh it will not let you take that as an option there's no option
[01:11:49.340 --> 01:11:54.220]   well you need another one i'm pushing a business account and a personal account
[01:11:54.220 --> 01:11:59.100]   but i i i i'm using the same device i can't do that oh that's all right i'm switching my my book
[01:11:59.100 --> 01:12:10.860]   reading over to guess what google play i uh yeah yeah so i'm disappointed on this uh yearly for
[01:12:10.860 --> 01:12:17.180]   device deauthorization limit i think this was previously the rule uh they had been very lenient
[01:12:17.180 --> 01:12:24.300]   which was nice but that's changed finally uh speaking of google cast now you can or crumb cast
[01:12:24.300 --> 01:12:32.220]   now you can crumb cast your g plus stream i love this to your big screen tv so browse and it reshes
[01:12:32.220 --> 01:12:38.460]   your family to your strangers to your family snapshots yeah you can flip through a post of manual
[01:12:38.460 --> 01:12:45.580]   controls or it has auto play um it i don't know it doesn't sound like it looks like it reformats
[01:12:45.580 --> 01:12:52.060]   too well it does big images do fill the screen with the post content at top and the source at bottom
[01:12:52.780 --> 01:12:59.100]   but i'm sad to say no animated gifs or gifs what what
[01:12:59.100 --> 01:13:05.020]   that's just an oversight i'm sure they'll fix that crumb cast gets more and more useful i have to say
[01:13:05.020 --> 01:13:12.220]   i love it and uh that's fun i haven't tried it yet but uh i did get the new version of uh google
[01:13:12.220 --> 01:13:17.580]   plus i'm looking forward to trying it tonight and that is your little jake
[01:13:18.940 --> 01:13:23.420]   damn i hope jina comes back next week jina come back come back little jina come back
[01:13:23.420 --> 01:13:35.740]   a lot of snowing news i'll skip that i don't you know snowing's got three years to live in russia
[01:13:35.740 --> 01:13:41.100]   reminds me of the old joke first place three years and a three-year trip to russia fourth place
[01:13:41.980 --> 01:13:49.260]   two five-year trip to russia i don't know okay uh twitter admits that there are 23 million
[01:13:49.260 --> 01:13:56.300]   active bots that's not necessarily bad i follow a lot of bots it's not spam bots necessarily
[01:13:56.300 --> 01:14:03.580]   oh that's actually not uh that's not true it's not true um courts are courting this will i
[01:14:03.580 --> 01:14:09.740]   yeah i actually wrote about that as well and i made the point that you just made which is some
[01:14:09.740 --> 01:14:16.380]   bots are good um some of them are funny some bots actually have useful things to say some sort of
[01:14:16.380 --> 01:14:21.180]   automated accounts give you information that's useful like we have a lot yes app or whatever we
[01:14:21.180 --> 01:14:26.540]   have a bot for those things as when the next show is yeah but so what happened was twitter
[01:14:26.540 --> 01:14:35.820]   updated its 10q and it tried to clarify a number that it gave before and by trying to clarify it
[01:14:35.820 --> 01:14:42.620]   it kind of made it less clear if you if you know what i mean so they said uh before uh they had
[01:14:42.620 --> 01:14:49.500]   estimated that 14 percent of users were accessing twitter through some third party application
[01:14:49.500 --> 01:14:55.660]   so then they tried to narrow it down a little bit more they said actually it wasn't 14 it was 11
[01:14:55.660 --> 01:15:02.460]   and of that 11 eight and a half percent were accessing it through some automated service
[01:15:02.460 --> 01:15:08.860]   that didn't require user input so what courts did was take that 8.5 percent and assume well that
[01:15:08.860 --> 01:15:17.100]   means 20 million 23 million are bots but the it was explained to me by someone close to twitter
[01:15:17.100 --> 01:15:25.580]   who didn't want to be named uh that the language in the 10q what they meant was automated services
[01:15:25.580 --> 01:15:33.900]   that poll tweets not automated services that post tweets oh so they're talking about uh a notification
[01:15:33.900 --> 01:15:39.740]   layer on your phone that basically just displays tweets without you having to use the app or go
[01:15:39.740 --> 01:15:47.260]   to the website that's what they meant so not bots oh well i'm surprised there's only 23 million
[01:15:48.860 --> 01:15:55.500]   yeah i mean uh doesn't every twitter third party twitter app do that poll poll tweets
[01:15:55.500 --> 01:16:02.540]   well yeah and so what i thought was interesting was it was a small number that
[01:16:02.540 --> 01:16:08.220]   means that's a tiny like twitter basically controls you know 90 percent of the universe
[01:16:08.220 --> 01:16:11.820]   yeah okay that's courts completely screwed that up
[01:16:14.220 --> 01:16:20.860]   that's clear like i read the 10q as well and it wasn't clear okay it just said without human
[01:16:20.860 --> 01:16:26.220]   interaction it didn't say just pulling tweets right so there's a but there's a big difference
[01:16:26.220 --> 01:16:30.940]   we're posting a tweet without human interaction and reading a tweet without human interaction
[01:16:30.940 --> 01:16:34.700]   right yeah so and the so the short answer is they don't know how many
[01:16:34.700 --> 01:16:41.340]   bots there are or they're not saying and bots are included under the spam heading but they're not
[01:16:41.340 --> 01:16:44.060]   necessarily spam because a lot of bots are very useful
[01:16:44.060 --> 01:16:50.700]   right you know things that give you weather there's lots of traffic update bots and i mean
[01:16:50.700 --> 01:16:57.660]   those aren't bad yeah the one i mentioned was uh uh kim kirker guard do you follow that at all
[01:16:57.660 --> 01:17:04.140]   so it's a mashup of kim kardashian's tweets and and so are in kirker guards exist at the
[01:17:04.140 --> 01:17:12.380]   last philosophy it's hysterical it's had that right now it's awesome kim kirker guard i should
[01:17:12.380 --> 01:17:18.860]   get a medal and is that a bot because it's doing it automatically it's a bot yeah really
[01:17:18.860 --> 01:17:26.940]   one of my other favorites is defunct but it stealth mountain if you use the phrase uh sneak peak
[01:17:26.940 --> 01:17:32.620]   and you spelled peak wrong it would respond automatically and say i think you mean because
[01:17:32.620 --> 01:17:37.820]   lots of people say peak like the mountain peak just one of those grammatical things that drives
[01:17:37.820 --> 01:17:41.100]   you nuts that would be good you should have another one of those so it's actually
[01:17:41.100 --> 01:17:49.740]   the count is kim kirker guardashian say that yeah three times fast just as the spirit is invisible
[01:17:49.740 --> 01:17:56.220]   so also is its language a secret and sometimes you can't tell when it's being sarcastic i don't
[01:17:56.220 --> 01:18:03.180]   see any kim in that here's another go do the big one go down go go yeah again i am burdened
[01:18:03.180 --> 01:18:07.660]   by a heaviness of the soul not going to call it baby weight because that's an excuse
[01:18:07.660 --> 01:18:09.100]   now that's good
[01:18:09.100 --> 01:18:20.620]   the sea struck up its song with a deep calm salinity the souls of the dead came forth to hold me in
[01:18:20.620 --> 01:18:28.860]   their comforting embrace yacht life where i'm on a boat beyond i love your tumblers infinite
[01:18:28.860 --> 01:18:35.580]   scroll down feature and the unfathomable insatiable emptiness behind it that's human written there's
[01:18:35.580 --> 01:18:41.340]   no way a human didn't do this look what i found in my luggage all my worldly troubles and sorrows
[01:18:41.340 --> 01:18:49.500]   my look is never complete without indescribable suffering okay that's one to follow that's good
[01:18:50.460 --> 01:18:55.820]   but i think a human's writing that definitely yeah that's no but they tweet them automatically
[01:18:55.820 --> 01:19:01.500]   ah oh well that yeah i mean what if you use hoot sweet or something to schedule tweets uh
[01:19:01.500 --> 01:19:06.140]   all you're sort of a part that's sort of a bot
[01:19:06.140 --> 01:19:11.180]   that's kind of a bot all right
[01:19:14.300 --> 01:19:18.540]   i tell you it's hard to use a chrome book to do this show
[01:19:18.540 --> 01:19:20.540]   uh do do do do do
[01:19:20.540 --> 01:19:25.660]   oh well i don't think we have to talk about facebook messenger we we've talked about that
[01:19:25.660 --> 01:19:35.180]   quite a bit on the show um twitch uh you know we it has not been officially
[01:19:35.180 --> 01:19:42.140]   a confirmed that youtube is buying twitch is that right Chad yeah twitch has not announced it yet
[01:19:42.140 --> 01:19:48.060]   it has not been announced but twitch.tv which was owned by justin.tv uh must they're making
[01:19:48.060 --> 01:19:57.420]   changes because they shut down justin.tv and they did it boom boom so i expect that to happen
[01:19:57.420 --> 01:20:05.020]   sometime soon if not whoops they've also implemented a youtube like um audio scanning feature to look
[01:20:05.020 --> 01:20:11.820]   for copyrighted audio in twitch oh yeah yeah twitch but they very they do a nice thing they just
[01:20:11.820 --> 01:20:18.300]   turn off the mute it so if um but it's kind of amazing because if there's a two-hour stream with
[01:20:18.300 --> 01:20:24.380]   three minutes of copyrighted audio the whole two-hour stream oh would be muted yes even your
[01:20:24.380 --> 01:20:30.620]   narration everything everything now this is not for live events so they're still not scanning live
[01:20:30.620 --> 01:20:36.140]   and they won't mute your stream if it's live but anything that's been recorded and archived
[01:20:36.140 --> 01:20:41.740]   like for the four or five days that it's up now uh it will uh be muted and the reason this is
[01:20:41.740 --> 01:20:47.580]   concerning is because of course there has always been a little tension between the game owners the
[01:20:47.580 --> 01:20:54.220]   video game content creators and these broadcasters over who owns the copyright not all many many
[01:20:54.220 --> 01:20:59.340]   video game companies realize this is a very good thing indeed for them and sells copies of the game
[01:20:59.340 --> 01:21:05.500]   but a few have issued takedown requests on youtube and there is a real cause for concern
[01:21:05.500 --> 01:21:11.260]   for the viability of twitch if the same thing should happen i think that actually if youtube
[01:21:11.260 --> 01:21:16.220]   buys twitch that's very good news remember when youtube started before google bought it there were
[01:21:16.220 --> 01:21:19.740]   serious concerns i remember interviewing Justin khan saying how are you gonna stay in business
[01:21:19.740 --> 01:21:24.940]   not just in khan that's you that's just in tv brian chan a brian um they're the founder of youtube
[01:21:24.940 --> 01:21:28.220]   uh saying how are you gonna stay in business because nbc at the time was soon them the
[01:21:28.220 --> 01:21:33.820]   people by a khan was there were people who were pissed off and uh you know had youtube not been
[01:21:33.820 --> 01:21:39.660]   acquired by google they might not have survived but google in its with its great power kept that
[01:21:39.660 --> 01:21:45.260]   worked out deals with content creators content creators started realize the value i imagine
[01:21:45.260 --> 01:21:49.580]   twitch the same thing would happen with gaming companies yeah and the np and chat rooms correct
[01:21:49.580 --> 01:21:54.220]   me it's only 30 minute blocks not a two hour so it's 30 minutes right so i guess i had only seen a
[01:21:54.220 --> 01:21:58.860]   snippet that was less than 30 minutes and the whole thing was muted and i went wow they mute
[01:21:58.860 --> 01:22:05.900]   the whole video they they actually said um their technical guy did a sort of the seat
[01:22:05.900 --> 01:22:10.940]   yo didn't around it asked me anything yes and said that they were gonna try and get better
[01:22:10.940 --> 01:22:16.060]   at doing discrete chunks instead of just massive you know half hour
[01:22:16.060 --> 01:22:21.180]   muting right and another issue is that sometimes something will be in game well that's what that's
[01:22:21.180 --> 01:22:27.580]   my questions to yeah so so let's say you know bio shock has a music play that they got the
[01:22:27.580 --> 01:22:31.980]   license to but then the actual license holder of the music hears it in your stream and they block
[01:22:31.980 --> 01:22:39.740]   it um that would be a problem yes and i think that's going to be another one where youtube and
[01:22:39.740 --> 01:22:44.940]   twitch have to go to the get you know electronic arts and say hey from now on when you negotiate
[01:22:44.940 --> 01:22:51.740]   these licenses make sure you include this additional usage um because it's i'm telling you it's good
[01:22:51.740 --> 01:22:57.580]   for the game i don't care if more people watch uh somebody paying uh playing legends of Zelda
[01:22:57.580 --> 01:23:03.260]   what is the league of legends then buy league of legends which is probably the case right i
[01:23:03.260 --> 01:23:07.340]   would guess jad there more people are watching people play league of legends on twitch that are
[01:23:07.340 --> 01:23:12.780]   actually buying the game a league of legends i'm not sure it's some i mean we don't see that with
[01:23:12.780 --> 01:23:19.100]   minecraft league of legends is a free game anyway oh well um now but with league of legends like
[01:23:19.100 --> 01:23:22.540]   there's the monetization that they have on league of legends is kind of amazing
[01:23:22.540 --> 01:23:28.780]   is it in-app purchases is it during basically and it's mostly all all uh skins or um
[01:23:28.780 --> 01:23:35.340]   thing yeah things and then also different characters so like uh they'll legal all the characters
[01:23:35.340 --> 01:23:39.420]   so that's a bad example i just use it because it's the number one game on twitch right now but
[01:23:39.420 --> 01:23:44.060]   right but the other games that you buy titanfall you might be what more people might be watching
[01:23:44.060 --> 01:23:49.820]   people play titanfall than buy titanfall absolutely but i do i do think that there is a definite
[01:23:49.820 --> 01:23:55.420]   correlation between how many people stream and how many uh how many cells but it's probably not
[01:23:55.420 --> 01:24:04.060]   the same amount you know you're good right goat simulator took off thanks to people watching
[01:24:04.060 --> 01:24:08.860]   other people play goat simulator i think pardry sj frankly but i think you're right that more people
[01:24:08.860 --> 01:24:12.860]   watched goat simulator than actually went out and purchased goat simulator it's not as much fun to
[01:24:12.860 --> 01:24:18.540]   play as it is to watch somebody play it right but still it definitely drove sales cells but it
[01:24:18.540 --> 01:24:23.660]   helped goat simulator and i'm sure they made more money than they would have if others had not
[01:24:23.660 --> 01:24:28.780]   been playing it and watching right yes uh is this new because somebody in the chat room keeps saying
[01:24:28.780 --> 01:24:34.220]   this is new google for education google classroom does i think we talked about this a couple of weeks
[01:24:34.220 --> 01:24:38.940]   ago we had mentioned that they were going to start something but this is snow out new yeah this is
[01:24:38.940 --> 01:24:43.740]   out it's a yeah also designed hand in hand with google apps for education so basically is it
[01:24:43.740 --> 01:24:49.660]   blackboard is it moodle what is it designed to help teachers create and collect assignments
[01:24:49.660 --> 01:24:54.940]   yeah paperlessly including time-saving features like the ability to automatically make a copy of
[01:24:54.940 --> 01:24:59.660]   a google document for each student all this is nice creates drive folders for each assignment for
[01:24:59.660 --> 01:25:05.420]   each student to keep track help everyone keep organized this is a little bit like blackboard
[01:25:05.420 --> 01:25:11.500]   or or moodle i'm not i'm not an educational expert so i'm not sure we use uh up at cinema
[01:25:11.500 --> 01:25:16.300]   academy where everybody gets a mac and tosh it's a one-on-one program but we do use google apps
[01:25:16.300 --> 01:25:21.500]   for education but we use moodle but i have to wonder if they might migrate to something like
[01:25:21.500 --> 01:25:26.540]   this if it can do many of the things they use moodle for this is so now they said anyone with
[01:25:26.540 --> 01:25:35.340]   a google apps for education account can use it wow free open wow uh that's pretty a pretty big deal
[01:25:35.340 --> 01:25:41.100]   uh sam harrelson's in the chat room he says he's the uh ed ed tech director at a school he says
[01:25:41.100 --> 01:25:46.860]   we're really excited about this because moodle actually if you ever look to moodle it's not
[01:25:46.860 --> 01:25:54.540]   it's not ugly is sin it's the ui is horrible yeah you can skin it it's like punching itself in the
[01:25:54.540 --> 01:25:58.220]   face yeah you can skin it but we're having a lot really hard time getting teachers to use it
[01:25:58.220 --> 01:26:04.380]   because it's ui is so bad not the function everybody likes the functionality yeah kids are kids are
[01:26:04.380 --> 01:26:10.140]   used to real user interfaces real software wow this is great
[01:26:10.140 --> 01:26:15.100]   um so you can read more at classroom.google.com
[01:26:15.100 --> 01:26:22.380]   and who do we lose? jeff's ghost it just left us oh that's why we have no audio from jim you hear
[01:26:22.380 --> 01:26:29.100]   me now yes we can hear you hear me now yep okay he's doing a Verizon ad of all the people in the
[01:26:29.100 --> 01:26:33.900]   world who would not i would not expect to do a Verizon ad it would be jeff javis can you hear
[01:26:33.900 --> 01:26:37.580]   me now sorry sorry i have no idea what happened but thank you i'm back yay
[01:26:37.580 --> 01:26:44.780]   uh so big big news actually from google and uh bad news for moodles open source and free but
[01:26:44.780 --> 01:26:50.780]   classroom uh blackboard is not it's got to be bad news blackboard sucks well that's what i hear
[01:26:50.780 --> 01:26:55.740]   everybody who uses blackboard and and moodles say god i wish there was something better terrible
[01:26:55.740 --> 01:27:00.380]   maybe maybe google has found the solution i keep trying to get our place to just switch over to
[01:27:00.380 --> 01:27:06.300]   google entirely i have to say i more and more i think the school should not buy macbooks
[01:27:06.300 --> 01:27:12.860]   which are still not eight or nine hundred bucks uh and i wish again another case where if you had a
[01:27:12.860 --> 01:27:16.780]   really nice five hundred dollar or six hundred dollar Chromebook it'd be a lot easier to recommend
[01:27:16.780 --> 01:27:20.540]   they'd be saving money but they'd get a good quality computer their students wouldn't complain
[01:27:20.540 --> 01:27:28.220]   that we've you've given us a netbook and then now they've got classroom pretty compelling
[01:27:29.340 --> 01:27:33.580]   well and don't forget how much education was a part of apple's growth strategy with the next
[01:27:33.580 --> 01:27:38.300]   generation right google's starting to copy apple's education strategy
[01:27:38.300 --> 01:27:45.740]   absolutely just it's in the cloud when i signed up for uh community college the the whole cloud
[01:27:45.740 --> 01:27:50.620]   infrastructure except for blackboard was google i got whenever i got my email was a google app
[01:27:50.620 --> 01:27:56.300]   email all of our docs all of everything was google except for that blackboard blackboards going on
[01:27:56.300 --> 01:28:01.100]   i would guess i'm sure the things you can do with blackboard you can't do it doesn't look like for
[01:28:01.100 --> 01:28:04.540]   instance grading is built into google classroom and stuff like that but good
[01:28:04.540 --> 01:28:08.300]   kill grades kill grades
[01:28:08.300 --> 01:28:19.660]   jeff well i haven't read this article maybe jeff did you put this in your jesebel starts open
[01:28:19.660 --> 01:28:24.780]   revolt against a doctor this was a fascinating fitting jesebel of course is a garker site uh and
[01:28:24.780 --> 01:28:33.180]   they had a real problem with uh trolling rape gifts oh so the jesebel is a site aimed at women
[01:28:33.180 --> 01:28:38.460]   they're women yeah at garker and they couldn't get the attention of the company of the developers
[01:28:38.460 --> 01:28:44.060]   and the prioritization list and so they wrote just a vitriolic public post about how garkers
[01:28:44.060 --> 01:28:47.980]   not paying attention to our problems and guess what happened next day garkers said okay you're
[01:28:47.980 --> 01:28:52.300]   you're raised up the dev list and and now it's happening so good for jesebel
[01:28:53.340 --> 01:29:01.260]   they uh thought that was fast and white garker they actually uh Jessica coen the outgoing
[01:29:01.260 --> 01:29:07.260]   editor apparently complained to jul johnson who's the editor in chief and he said you should write
[01:29:07.260 --> 01:29:14.700]   about it i mean that's the one thing about garkers you know and it's it's one of nick dentans you know
[01:29:14.700 --> 01:29:20.060]   fundamental principles everything should be out in the open including all the fighting and arguing
[01:29:20.060 --> 01:29:28.300]   and so they wrote about it and jul to his credit said both on twitter and in a comment on jesebel
[01:29:28.300 --> 01:29:33.100]   thanks for mentioning it you're right i dropped the ball you know we need to solve this problem
[01:29:33.100 --> 01:29:40.940]   and the last they did an update to the post and said that they're going to uh re-institute pending
[01:29:40.940 --> 01:29:47.420]   comments which they used to have so you'll be able to see that there is a pending comment that
[01:29:47.420 --> 01:29:53.100]   hasn't been approved and you can choose to look at it or not and it you know that gives you the
[01:29:53.100 --> 01:29:58.220]   sort of leeway to not be surprised by some violent um porn gift
[01:29:58.220 --> 01:30:09.020]   it was only a matter of time but uh at black hat hackers showed that they could infect nest
[01:30:09.020 --> 01:30:16.300]   thermostats and turn your head up is this a big deal or am i ever seen something here it is a big
[01:30:16.300 --> 01:30:21.100]   deal and i'll tell you why i agree with you my first reaction is so they can change the temperature
[01:30:21.100 --> 01:30:26.780]   in my house so what but it's more than that it's more than that because the nest thermostat is on
[01:30:26.780 --> 01:30:32.620]   your network and so the real risk is and we're gonna see a lot of that excuse me you're gonna see a
[01:30:32.620 --> 01:30:38.700]   lot of this in the internet of things that these poorly designed things that are connected to your
[01:30:38.700 --> 01:30:45.340]   network become entry points for baggers access points yeah exactly exactly so they get access to
[01:30:45.340 --> 01:30:51.660]   one poorly protected device they get access to your whole network yeah so they were able to
[01:30:51.660 --> 01:30:56.940]   compromise the nest device what did it take to compromise it did they have to have it physically
[01:30:56.940 --> 01:31:04.780]   though uh it doesn't it looks a little more reference to being a used nest
[01:31:04.780 --> 01:31:13.820]   i love the you know what they i'm sorry so i saw something the wrong way and i love what they did in
[01:31:13.820 --> 01:31:18.860]   the demo they put a text up on they actually changed the image on the nest the image the nest
[01:31:18.860 --> 01:31:25.180]   has a LCD screen at its heart which normally just shows the temperature they put a little how i up
[01:31:25.180 --> 01:31:31.580]   and the words i know that you and frank are planning to disconnect me and i'm afraid that is something
[01:31:31.580 --> 01:31:38.700]   i cannot allow to happen it is really funny because the nest has built in battery and so even if you
[01:31:38.700 --> 01:31:44.060]   rip it off the wall it will still do that it'll still work yeah the live screen will show up
[01:31:44.060 --> 01:31:50.380]   so that story was updated with a comment from nest they said physical access was required oh well
[01:31:50.380 --> 01:31:56.060]   that's true okay yeah and meaningless well that's that's not trivial that's that's a big deal it's not
[01:31:56.060 --> 01:32:01.020]   as if you know what what what my cleaning lady is going to come in and pull the the nest so what
[01:32:01.020 --> 01:32:10.460]   really says is no it they had to have physical access though right yeah so so why is this i don't
[01:32:10.460 --> 01:32:16.460]   it's not an issue this big alarm no if you have access to any hardware device your if a bad guy
[01:32:16.460 --> 01:32:22.380]   has access to it you're screwed right yeah period but he was saying the story's trivial not not the
[01:32:22.380 --> 01:32:28.620]   fact yeah yeah yeah yeah i'm saying this hack is meaningless in the words they plugged a usb device
[01:32:28.620 --> 01:32:53.340]   into it and put it in developer mode and then loaded their own software hell
[01:32:53.340 --> 01:32:58.700]   but it has to be it has to be attackable over the internet or it's meaningless i think yeah but it's
[01:32:58.700 --> 01:33:03.500]   partly because they know that the device is going to be in your secure home and and and some bad
[01:33:03.500 --> 01:33:08.140]   guy come in your home they're probably gonna be stealing your jewels not hacking your nest right
[01:33:08.140 --> 01:33:15.260]   unless the only thing i could the only thing i could think of is the nsa you know pre-hacked
[01:33:15.260 --> 01:33:21.580]   routers that were then sold and shipped to customers that's a pretty bad nest yeah but you know the
[01:33:21.580 --> 01:33:27.980]   truth is whenever we buy any technology we are trusting that the manufacturer the technology
[01:33:27.980 --> 01:33:34.460]   has not embedded malware into it that's the very nature of what there is a trust relationship
[01:33:34.460 --> 01:33:39.820]   when you buy anything there's a trust relationship that your garage door opener doesn't have a microphone
[01:33:39.820 --> 01:33:47.180]   and camera in it uh you you have to trust the manufacturer so to say oh oh yeah manufacture could
[01:33:47.180 --> 01:33:52.300]   do bad things well yes absolutely they could they have always been able to
[01:33:52.300 --> 01:33:56.860]   um of course it's a little different if something's always online because then
[01:33:56.860 --> 01:34:00.700]   there's somewhere for that garage door opener to send the microphone in there
[01:34:00.700 --> 01:34:06.620]   send the data right send the audio video uh the ibm pc
[01:34:06.620 --> 01:34:16.300]   33 years old it's still a youngin well and that's basically how long i have pc
[01:34:17.020 --> 01:34:23.820]   a real pc yeah 33 years but my original was an Osborne one but that's been as long as i've had it
[01:34:23.820 --> 01:34:29.660]   and uh and now i'm on Chromebook so that's the limit by personal computer era ibm shipped the
[01:34:29.660 --> 01:34:38.460]   first pc the 5150 uh because every ibm device had to have a number on the 12th of august 1981
[01:34:38.460 --> 01:34:43.740]   33 years ago today and and the world uh i think the world changed
[01:34:44.620 --> 01:34:51.100]   it's quite a story in that worth memory remembering i could still
[01:34:51.100 --> 01:34:55.100]   couple of years later that keyboard under my finger oh it was a good keyboard
[01:34:55.100 --> 01:34:59.580]   it failed damn fine keyboard that clicky clicky clicky keyboard right very clicky
[01:34:59.580 --> 01:35:02.780]   clicky click I don't think you'd like it today but i think coming from typewriters
[01:35:02.780 --> 01:35:10.860]   4.8 sietari 1040 yeah i had a tari 400 and 800
[01:35:12.380 --> 01:35:16.540]   but i remember when the 1040 that was an attractive one man i was born in one
[01:35:16.540 --> 01:35:25.500]   1040 was awesome 1040 st had a trash icon had desktop icons had dragon drops incredible
[01:35:25.500 --> 01:35:31.740]   it's jam right wasn't that the os the graphic os jam yeah yep it's pretty sophisticated for
[01:35:31.740 --> 01:35:40.300]   those days and midi support too that's right and how much memory 48k oh i don't remember
[01:35:41.420 --> 01:35:46.460]   my it's our at 48k i think i don't know i think my osborn one had 96 cap 96
[01:35:46.460 --> 01:35:57.500]   whoo and the first ibm pc ran at 4.77 megahertz not gigahertz my friends megahertz all right
[01:35:57.500 --> 01:36:04.140]   time to wrap things up with uh picks and tips and the light do you want Matthew do you want to throw
[01:36:04.140 --> 01:36:11.020]   us a tip or anything uh give me a minute we're gonna jump and all you think
[01:36:11.020 --> 01:36:17.660]   jeff jarvis will give us a number so this week on august 19th it will be 10 years since the google
[01:36:17.660 --> 01:36:24.460]   i appeal uh it came out at an astronomical 23 billion it according to this story i don't know
[01:36:24.460 --> 01:36:29.980]   why i haven't checked right now but it was 390 million that makes a 17x um
[01:36:31.660 --> 01:36:38.780]   value increase third largest evaluation in the world pretty amazing
[01:36:38.780 --> 01:36:42.220]   who's number one apple
[01:36:42.220 --> 01:36:49.420]   uh i should know that apple the next on mobile and ex on apple x on google the big three
[01:36:49.420 --> 01:36:51.580]   yeah wow
[01:36:51.580 --> 01:36:55.340]   wow pretty amazing huh 10 years
[01:36:59.660 --> 01:37:04.220]   anything uh you've got uh or should i should i vamp some more for you
[01:37:04.220 --> 01:37:09.820]   we didn't talk about you know and this was something we talked about on uh twit on sunday
[01:37:09.820 --> 01:37:14.700]   and security now yesterday we probably should mention this uh that google has decided to rank
[01:37:14.700 --> 01:37:23.660]   a little bit higher sites that support https secure http they're going to use it as a ranking
[01:37:24.300 --> 01:37:29.740]   signal they say we're we're only going to do it one percent ranking improvement for right now
[01:37:29.740 --> 01:37:35.340]   because we want to give a lot of things it doesn't really matter right no most things it
[01:37:35.340 --> 01:37:41.100]   doesn't matter right that's the only i'm somewhat in support of the idea of http everywhere we've
[01:37:41.100 --> 01:37:46.940]   talked about that on security now a long time and i think it's a you know certainly you know
[01:37:46.940 --> 01:37:53.100]   facebook and gmail should use it and do um but there's no reason why i should have to encrypt my
[01:37:53.100 --> 01:38:00.300]   traffic from twit.tv to your browser or vice versa just uh it's a waste of uh you know
[01:38:00.300 --> 01:38:06.620]   cpu cycles and it's expensive you have to buy a certificate for you know 50 bucks a year or more
[01:38:06.620 --> 01:38:13.100]   right um so they say for right now it's only a very lightweight signal affecting fewer than one
[01:38:13.100 --> 01:38:17.740]   percent of global queries and carrying less weight than other signals such as high quality
[01:38:17.740 --> 01:38:23.020]   content while i would hope so well the site secure the content sucks but the site secure
[01:38:23.020 --> 01:38:28.700]   um meantime over time we may decide to strengthen that because we'd like to encourage all website
[01:38:28.700 --> 01:38:36.220]   owners to switch to https doesn't make any sense google i agree that there are lots of sites that
[01:38:36.220 --> 01:38:42.140]   should be secure that aren't but there are many many many many many many more sites that don't need
[01:38:42.140 --> 01:38:49.100]   to be secure and i don't think you could argue this is a good idea
[01:38:49.100 --> 01:38:58.220]   i guess you guys agree Steve agrees of all people i mean Steve Gibson who's been lobbying for https
[01:38:58.220 --> 01:39:05.980]   said no it was crazy is that your daughter yes time to go fishing
[01:39:08.460 --> 01:39:14.140]   not yet all right well you've been here one thing yes one thing i was going to mention i can't
[01:39:14.140 --> 01:39:20.460]   remember if i mentioned this before but um did i mention vellum the new york times labs
[01:39:20.460 --> 01:39:31.580]   it's uh it basically sucks in your twitter uh count and then shows you links that people you
[01:39:31.580 --> 01:39:41.740]   follow have shared no quite well done um v l l u m dot n y t labs dot com yeah and it's really well
[01:39:41.740 --> 01:39:48.220]   it's very very simple um it just shows you who shared it and it's kind of a way if you've been away
[01:39:48.220 --> 01:39:54.300]   twitter and you feel like you've missed some interesting links you just go to vellum and it
[01:39:54.300 --> 01:39:59.740]   shows you what people have been sharing i've been using it a lot actually i like it i'm gonna
[01:39:59.740 --> 01:40:05.020]   i'm logging in right now one of my students had a business that was going to do that more and she
[01:40:05.020 --> 01:40:09.820]   never you know you could have all the ideas in the world but it's all execution i wish she'd uh
[01:40:09.820 --> 01:40:15.180]   she pursued that it's about five years ago yeah because taking the links that you have in a day
[01:40:15.180 --> 01:40:21.340]   that's the that's the meat of the value and then analyzing that can bring a lot of a lot of um
[01:40:21.340 --> 01:40:27.820]   you could add value to it and it's you know there's paper dot l i and others things like that
[01:40:27.820 --> 01:40:31.020]   to do that but um but i think it's really well done and it's well designed
[01:40:31.020 --> 01:40:38.140]   well as soon as i get my second factor authentication code from twitter i'll be able to pull it up
[01:40:38.140 --> 01:40:45.500]   thanks oh you already got it chad you're so good and it's a pretty they don't have an app for this
[01:40:45.500 --> 01:40:53.900]   though it's just a web page uh yeah yeah it's fast though so that's very nice yeah instagram
[01:40:53.900 --> 01:40:59.260]   hires a new chief i didn't know that well there you go look at that look at that news already flowing
[01:40:59.260 --> 01:41:07.180]   in i know oh my goodness and then i have like my groups my lists so if i wanted to create a list of
[01:41:07.180 --> 01:41:14.140]   people uh who make news and not follow them i could do that as well no that's actually good i do that
[01:41:14.140 --> 01:41:24.300]   all the time yeah that's that's great good i'm authorizing it right now vellum.nytlabs.com
[01:41:24.300 --> 01:41:29.020]   also have multiple people share it it looks like their icons will show up multiple like i'll see
[01:41:29.020 --> 01:41:33.900]   seven or eight i don't know i have to say more and more i'm using things like nuzzle uh which is
[01:41:33.900 --> 01:41:39.260]   jonathan abraham's creation he said the guy did frenster prismatic brad cross at google did this
[01:41:39.260 --> 01:41:46.300]   these are social news feeds and they're same idea not just twitter it could be other social
[01:41:46.300 --> 01:41:51.580]   sources like facebook but uh they work really well and it's a great way to surface news that i might
[01:41:51.580 --> 01:41:58.620]   not otherwise uh see a little different than like reading flip board yeah i use prismatic and uh
[01:41:58.620 --> 01:42:04.940]   big fan of brads um they've changed a little bit so they're they're focusing much more on the discussion
[01:42:05.660 --> 01:42:12.700]   within prismatic around those links uh uh whereas vellum and nuzzle are still pretty much just
[01:42:12.700 --> 01:42:19.260]   the dash forward yeah that shows you yeah yeah i've been using uh uh using uh prismatic and nuzzle
[01:42:19.260 --> 01:42:24.860]   pretty much every morning to look at see what's going on i you can't still can't beat tech meme
[01:42:24.860 --> 01:42:32.460]   though for just like here's the ten big stories yeah it's just really it's right there and do you
[01:42:32.460 --> 01:42:36.620]   does anybody still use google news jesus no
[01:42:36.620 --> 01:42:45.580]   i actually will i use it every week for the show yeah i i will too yeah the side tech section
[01:42:45.580 --> 01:42:50.700]   most yeah i mean for me like tech meme is what i want to know what people are talking about google
[01:42:50.700 --> 01:42:55.980]   news is what i want the algorithm yeah what what does the algorithm thing what do the bots think yeah
[01:42:56.940 --> 01:43:04.220]   i use um google play new stand new stand is a great app for android it's it's like support is
[01:43:04.220 --> 01:43:09.020]   beautiful is it well i always assume it's just trying to sell me magazines but no
[01:43:09.020 --> 01:43:13.340]   no it's not it's not and things like that's how i actually read the verge i prefer to read the
[01:43:13.340 --> 01:43:18.540]   verge on play new stand that i don't want to really uh yeah i think they've changed i think
[01:43:18.540 --> 01:43:24.700]   they've changed it uh here's but you still make a really good point leo um not to insult anyone
[01:43:24.700 --> 01:43:29.260]   who's that who's there and they're wonderful people but i don't i think google news is is is
[01:43:29.260 --> 01:43:39.260]   in preserved an aspect yeah it could really show the way in so many ways for news it could do so much
[01:43:39.260 --> 01:43:48.140]   um and and it's not competitive apart from the german's and murdock just nevermind them it it
[01:43:48.140 --> 01:43:54.780]   can send traffic to news sites in amazing ways it could it could understand me and my tastes and
[01:43:54.780 --> 01:43:59.740]   my interests yeah i'm arguing constantly now that news has to become a relationship business it has
[01:43:59.740 --> 01:44:04.860]   to give me higher relevance and news sites don't do that and what google news could do in the long
[01:44:04.860 --> 01:44:11.180]   run is share data about me and my interests with news sites with my permission of course and could
[01:44:11.180 --> 01:44:17.260]   bring me more relevance across the whole pantheon of news but it just kind of sits there uh it's pretty
[01:44:17.260 --> 01:44:23.980]   you know i talked to uh works well when i when i was at the the journalism festival in italy i
[01:44:23.980 --> 01:44:30.380]   i talked to a couple people from google news and i basically said exactly the same thing there's
[01:44:30.380 --> 01:44:37.740]   so much it could do there's so much more that it could do it's it's you know it was pretty good five
[01:44:37.740 --> 01:44:42.940]   years ago in terms of showing you headlines but there's there's so little personalization there's
[01:44:42.940 --> 01:44:48.780]   so little intelligence you know for for a company that's built around intelligence and has
[01:44:48.780 --> 01:44:56.540]   1500 math PhDs or whatever there's so little intelligence in that product and it feels like it's
[01:44:56.540 --> 01:45:02.620]   there's two guys working weekends you know in their spare time on the thing but it's not it's
[01:45:02.620 --> 01:45:07.420]   and they very talented team of very smart people but i'm actually putting a degree behind it and
[01:45:07.420 --> 01:45:14.060]   and i think they shared they shared my frustration to some extent and and the only thing one person
[01:45:14.060 --> 01:45:21.420]   said who i won't name was that it's run by the product guys it's not run by the technology
[01:45:21.420 --> 01:45:29.260]   sordi and so yeah right and so the product product person a good product person always says hmm
[01:45:29.260 --> 01:45:33.500]   how can we make something better for the user what is the user one let's make those needs
[01:45:33.500 --> 01:45:39.740]   start these were my put in order for them it was fun they they have to sort of get past
[01:45:39.740 --> 01:45:45.100]   so the product guys control the feature list you know what we're going to do with it and so
[01:45:45.100 --> 01:45:50.380]   the things that they wanted to do are not necessarily what the product guys wanted to do
[01:45:50.380 --> 01:45:55.580]   but a product a product guy i mean i've heard i've heard it said lately to some people
[01:45:55.580 --> 01:46:00.860]   when editors talk to technologists technologists say to the editors you're a product person
[01:46:01.820 --> 01:46:09.580]   and a product person properly molded is the voice of the user sure and so i have no problem with
[01:46:09.580 --> 01:46:14.940]   product people running the show so long as they are a good voice of the user as so long as they
[01:46:14.940 --> 01:46:19.820]   plumb the possibilities well on behalf of users and i and i think it's just so much more that
[01:46:19.820 --> 01:46:24.620]   google news could be i don't maybe they're scared of it politically the more they touch it the more
[01:46:24.620 --> 01:46:31.500]   dermal is gonna say right i was gonna say maybe they're afraid of adding too much functionality
[01:46:31.500 --> 01:46:38.060]   because then it'll just become a uneven larger red flag for media companies to jump on google
[01:46:38.060 --> 01:46:43.020]   and say you're that's where they share things with them i mean it's show show yep give reports
[01:46:43.020 --> 01:46:46.940]   to the media companies how much traffic will send you when you send traffic give data about
[01:46:46.940 --> 01:46:53.100]   the users with the user's permission um where where you can bring greater value there's a lot of ways
[01:46:53.100 --> 01:46:59.340]   you could be used to clearly benefit i agree i also think i agree um embedding articles in
[01:46:59.340 --> 01:47:05.900]   google news so people can read actually more and discover the optimal way to link articles embedded
[01:47:05.900 --> 01:47:14.700]   articles have a lot of value in that way so yeah well on that note no i think we're gonna
[01:47:14.700 --> 01:47:21.260]   wrap this thing up this is a punctual leo report well i do feel like we don't want to we want to
[01:47:21.260 --> 01:47:28.860]   leave a lot more no exactly and uh and by the way Matthew Ingram the chatroom says if there's a
