[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   It's time for Twig this week in Google Great Panel for you Stacey Higginbotham, Jeff Jarvis,
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   and Pruitt. We're going to be talking about the Google event coming up in a couple of weeks,
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   and what to expect, maybe a new Chromebook, maybe a new phone.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   We'll talk about Facebook, its new oversight board, how that's going to work, how it might not work,
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   and why Apple should just stop giving keynotes. It's all coming up next on Twig.

[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   Professor of Journalism at CUNY in New York.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   But the Newmark Graduate School of Journalism.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   Now is this a rule that you have to say that every time to give credit?
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   It is the name of the school.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   The Newmark Graduate School of Journalism.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   It's the name of the school.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   Yes.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   But it is at CUNY, the city of New York.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   It's the new Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at CUNY.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   Can I use an acronym?
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   Seems like a lot of work.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   Craig's school?
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   Craig's school.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   Stacey's laughing.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   Stacey Higginbotham's also here.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   She doesn't have a long title.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   She's the woman in charge of stacey on IOT.com
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   and co-host with Kevin Tofel of the IOT podcast, Tala Stacey.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Hello.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   Hello.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   From the great Pacific Northwest, winter is coming.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   Mm-hmm.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   That's all I have to say.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   The rain is already here.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   Yeah, but it is.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   I actually miss rain.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   We got a little rain this morning.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   It was kind of nice.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   I miss rain.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   Also joining us.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   And I think we're going to get to see a little bit more of that because I really like having
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   them on the show.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   Oh, it's so do we.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   And I like his lower third of Twit.tv.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   Man, look at that.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   That's good.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   That's good, isn't it?
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   That's a good stuff.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   Oh, and we should promote.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   California is awesome.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   Other than waking up this morning thinking I had a leak, like a plumbing leak, it was
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   just rain.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   [laughter]
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   So it wasn't coming in the house.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   It wasn't coming in the house, but I heard it.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   You heard drip, drip, drip.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   I'm like, oh crap, something's wrong.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   Oh, it's raining.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   Well, I told you.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   Oh, you're not going to see any rain in October, and or maybe November.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   Foolish me.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   You pretended you couldn't believe it.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   But it stopped raining in May and you won't see more rain until October.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   That's right.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   That's the California way, and I fell for it.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   [laughter]
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   It moved out of here.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   So we should promote what else Ant is doing at Twit.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   Well, I don't know.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   Some of it's super secret.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   We've got two shows in the works.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   We have two in the works, but I do have a hands-on tech segment.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   So make sure you subscribe to Hands-on Tech.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   That's Twit.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   What are you reviewing?
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   /hot.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   There is a fancy little AI camera that I reviewed, and it's pretty slick.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   Ant's going to, among other things, but one of the things Ant's going to do is be our photography guru.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   He's going to teach me the ways of the sensei.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   Oh boy.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   And we're not so risky.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   We're working on a couple of shows with Ant, and there'll be more to come.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   And same thing with our other new host, Micah Sargent.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   A couple new shows will be announcing soon with Micah.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   And I'm actually doing a new show called Ask the Tech Guy, which is just really more of me.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   [laughter]
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   We don't need enough of you, my man.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   Oh yeah, right.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   Just for any more Leo.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   So Google announced its event October 15th.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   And it's in your backyard, JJ.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   It is.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   It's only Joe.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   I know I have a meeting that day that's killing me.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   Oh, come on.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   We'd love to get to cancel that.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   Like, what kind of meeting?
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   You are, JJ.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   It's a big diversity meeting with lots of people coming in.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   Oh, you can't cancel that now.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   Oh, no.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   Well, we're going to cover it.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   I presume it's going to be, I think it's 7 a.m.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   It's going to be live.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   They're going to stream it.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   We will be covering it at 7 a.m.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   I will not be in the studio at 7 a.m.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   I will be here with Mr. Jason Howell.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   Jason Howell and Ant have volunteered to come in very, very early in the morning.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   Looking forward to it.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   You know, it's a little disappointment for me.
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   Kevin's going to be there.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   Oh, yeah, good.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   Nice.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   Kevin to be crazy.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   He's going to be there.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   Because, oh, oh, you mean at the event?
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   Yes.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   Oh, yeah, because the Pixelbook 2, right?
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   Mmm.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   I'm sure, happily, I hope.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   Allegedly.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   I'm so happy.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   Kevin will be joining us next week on the show to talk about what he's hoping.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   In addition to us covering it here, Florence from all about Androids, she's going to be
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   there.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   She's going as well.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   So, Kevin Tofel, Florence, I, so we'll definitely be covering it.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   This, according to a 9 to 5 Google, it's a second time that the Pixelbook 2 has shown up at
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   the FCC, which is weird.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   A clam, shell, shell, notebook, codename Atlas.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   It'll be built by Quanta, which has built other Google Chromebooks before.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   We don't know a whole lot based on this entry.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   It has a Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, the...
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   Chock.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   ...all.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   Quanta built the space.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   Well, if it didn't have those, we would notice.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   That would be a big story.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   Actually, I'm curious.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   You know, Apple announced at its event, and now we're starting to see new computers come
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   with Wi-Fi 6, 802.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   Oh, I knew you would know something about this.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   802.11AX.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   Stacey Higginbotham, go.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   Okay, so this is what we're telling everybody.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   The big news about Wi-Fi 6 is it is AX.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   It is designed to support many, many devices at once.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   So many different devices sending data around.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   For most people in the home, this is going to be a big deal, where it is going to matter
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   is places like corporations, enterprise campuses, stadiums, where you're trying to send a lot
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   of data in one place and kind of big, big crowds of people.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   And what you'll want to do is buy Wi-Fi ready phones or Wi-Fi enabled...
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   6.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   Sorry, sorry.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   Wi-Fi 6 enabled phones.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   Yeah.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   I know the new iPhone is.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   When we're talking about your home and your current router purchases, I'm going to tell you
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   not to run out and buy a new printer.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   Really?
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   Oh, my God.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   Because this is not something, until you have like 50 or more devices and they all have
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   Wi-Fi 6 compatible, you're not going to see the benefits.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   And 50 is a high number.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   We'll say 30 to 40.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   So what phones are already...
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   Are phones already compatible?
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   Well, the iPhone is, I believe, the Huawei...
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   The Huawei...
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   There are new phones announcements coming from OnePlus next week, Huawei, Google...
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   Huawei's or Wi-Fi 6.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   I'm going to guess anything announced from now on will be Wi-Fi 6.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   Yeah, let me just make sure that Apple Wi-Fi 6.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   No, they did.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   They made a big deal about it being Wi-Fi 6.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   Okay.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   I thought you said it was all in the afternoon.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   I swear they did.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   No, no, they made a big deal about it.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   But I think that's the first phone I'd heard of.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   Maybe Huawei.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   I think you're right.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   So, but there's no benefit to you at home with Wi-Fi 6 if you don't have a Wi-Fi 6 router.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   But there might be, as you say, a benefit in a crowded space like a football stadium.
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   Totally.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   You'll want it on your phone.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   And if you're like a gadget person who goes to lots of events that's going to have Wi-Fi
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   and tons of people running Wi-Fi in a launch event, perhaps, you'll want that on your computer.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   We'll need that for CES.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   Yes.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   So, I stand correct.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:45.440]   If you're scooter X says that the Samsung S10 S10 plus S10E, and presumably that means the
[00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:47.520]   Note 10 all are Wi-Fi 6 as well.
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:48.520]   Oh, nice.
[00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:50.800]   So, the newest Samsung phones are Wi-Fi 6.
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:53.800]   So thank you, scooter X.
[00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:57.720]   So if you are in the market right now for a new router, like you're like, "Oh, I'm dying.
[00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:58.800]   I need a router."
[00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:01.360]   Get one that's Wi-Fi 6 ready.
[00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:05.960]   But don't, like, if your router's fine, you can wait a couple of years because in the
[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:10.600]   home, all of your smart devices that you might think would gain from this aren't because
[00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:13.160]   those devices aren't going to get Wi-Fi 6 for a while.
[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:14.680]   But it will be good for IoT.
[00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:18.680]   I mean, this is something if you get a new IoT device you'd probably look for, right?
[00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:28.160]   So I talked to the product manager over at Google Nest about Wi-Fi 6 and they are...
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:29.240]   Here's what they said.
[00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:31.720]   That the bill of materials is going to be higher on Wi-Fi 6.
[00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:35.840]   That doesn't necessarily make sense for devices that can't take advantage of it.
[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:40.800]   And right now, there's not a real reason for most smart home devices to try to take advantage
[00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:42.040]   of it.
[00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:46.840]   So I would say, "You're fine."
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:52.280]   Do you have a minute to share the nerdy side of it far as how this is going to work because
[00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:53.280]   we're thinking about it?
[00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:54.280]   Don't you think it'll be a Bible?
[00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:59.800]   Well, I'm thinking about just being at a stadium or CES or something like that and
[00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:02.600]   you have all of this congestion on a network.
[00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:07.720]   Is the router just a better traffic cop at this point?
[00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:11.080]   There's a better traffic cop and then there's also the MIMO.
[00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:13.760]   So okay, call me out here.
[00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:15.480]   Multiple in multiple out.
[00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:16.480]   Yes.
[00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:19.880]   So they have multi-user multiple in multiple out.
[00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:21.880]   So MU MIMO.
[00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:22.880]   Okay.
[00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:23.880]   So MU MIMO.
[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:24.880]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:10:24.880 --> 00:10:25.880]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:29.720]   So what's going to happen is with all of those antennas, you're allowed to create a
[00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:30.720]   more direct paths.
[00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:33.400]   You're allowed to calculate these kind of very direct paths.
[00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:35.760]   Be informing or something else?
[00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:38.800]   Oh, I may be confusing MIMO and be informing.
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:41.280]   Because beamforming is available in Wi-Fi 5.
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:43.360]   It has your dot 11 AC.
[00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:44.360]   Yes.
[00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:48.880]   I think the antenna configurations give you more capability.
[00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:49.880]   Now I'm forgetting.
[00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:50.880]   Oh my gosh.
[00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:52.840]   So here's one of the issues with Wi-Fi and I'm curious.
[00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:56.760]   I bet you this is an attempt to solve this, which is it's like ethernet, a collision-based
[00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:57.760]   network.
[00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:03.800]   And this is something I only recently learned and I was kind of disappointed to learn.
[00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:10.080]   When you have Wi-Fi traffic in a house, if you have multiple routers or multiple devices,
[00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:14.840]   if two devices start speaking at the same time, the same thing happens on an ethernet,
[00:11:14.840 --> 00:11:16.760]   one device will say, oh, I'm sorry.
[00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:17.760]   All right.
[00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:18.760]   My bad.
[00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:19.760]   And stop.
[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:20.760]   You go.
[00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:22.520]   The other device will continue, but then that's the device.
[00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:25.840]   And if it's your device, that means you are now halted.
[00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:29.880]   No more Wi-Fi for you for a period of time, a random period of time, and then you begin
[00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:31.280]   again.
[00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:36.640]   Collision-based networks do not handle a lot of different devices very well.
[00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:37.640]   Ethernet is that way as well.
[00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:41.560]   It's why you segment a LAN in your office to avoid that.
[00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:47.280]   And I think it's one of the reasons Wi-Fi has become increasingly less effective in
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:49.840]   a home is because we have so many devices now.
[00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:58.160]   I'm a little sorry to hear that 802.11AX, what new Wi-Fi 6, isn't going to be on IoT
[00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:01.800]   devices because I feel like that's the devices that are screwing up my Wi-Fi.
[00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:05.400]   Well, so most of them aren't always on in the same way.
[00:12:05.400 --> 00:12:06.800]   They're low bandwidth devices.
[00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:09.360]   Well, they're low bandwidth and they're very intermittent.
[00:12:09.360 --> 00:12:11.840]   Now, ScooterX just put this in to save me.
[00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:12.840]   Thanks, ScooterX.
[00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:14.840]   He's been out of research today.
[00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:15.840]   Thank you.
[00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:20.800]   So, Wi-Fi 6 access points will be able to divvy up each individual signal between multiple
[00:12:20.800 --> 00:12:24.960]   recipient devices, servicing all of them with a single transmission like a truck driver
[00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:27.120]   making multiple stops on a route.
[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:28.120]   Interesting.
[00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:32.720]   Okay, so that's how it's going to deal with congestion.
[00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:37.560]   But I don't, so I can't remember if MIMO is just about capacity.
[00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:40.840]   I really feel like there's not necessarily a beamforming angle, but there's an angle
[00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:41.840]   there.
[00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:42.840]   MIMO has been around for a while.
[00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:44.480]   We've had MIMO for a long time.
[00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:48.080]   Well, and that's what, so if you listen to Qualcomm, that's what they're, we've had
[00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:51.200]   MIMO on the cellular side for a while.
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:52.200]   Right.
[00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:53.200]   And we're now bringing it into Wi-Fi.
[00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:56.760]   And that's why Qualcomm's like, "We have such an advantage because we've been doing
[00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:57.760]   something."
[00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:58.760]   We know MIMO.
[00:12:58.760 --> 00:12:59.760]   Yeah.
[00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:00.760]   But, okay.
[00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:04.960]   Anyway, the point is, is a good thing to get in a new device.
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:13.320]   I understand that something like an Echo or a Bluetooth, you know, your smart lock is
[00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:15.480]   probably not going to be a critical device.
[00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:20.560]   But if you have a camera that's always on like an S-cam, I think you would want it,
[00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:21.560]   to be honest.
[00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:23.960]   I imagine those will come out first.
[00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:24.960]   Yeah.
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:30.720]   But again, it's not something, you don't see a lot of advantage from it until you get,
[00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:34.200]   like, again, like 30 to 50 devices in your house.
[00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:36.200]   But I have that many.
[00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:37.200]   Cameras?
[00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:38.200]   That need, I mean, it needs...
[00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:39.200]   Well, devices, you're right.
[00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:45.400]   But a lot of Echo's, a lot of Google assistants, those probably don't need it.
[00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:46.960]   I have so many devices.
[00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:50.280]   I'm like, "It's really out of control."
[00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:53.360]   And I don't see, I think I'm an outlier now, but not for much longer.
[00:13:53.360 --> 00:13:54.920]   This is going to be more and more common.
[00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:55.920]   Yeah.
[00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:56.920]   I mean...
[00:13:56.920 --> 00:14:01.560]   No, the average home, according to Comcast, I think the most recent stats, they have 13
[00:14:01.560 --> 00:14:02.760]   devices in their house now.
[00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:03.760]   Why have I been able to...
[00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:07.720]   Everybody has a tablet, everybody has a phone, everybody has some IoT thing.
[00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:09.120]   It's commonplace now.
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:17.360]   I now have four Nest cameras, a Hello Doorbell, probably five Echo's, maybe an equal number
[00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:18.360]   of Google assistants.
[00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:19.360]   See, you do.
[00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:22.280]   You are the one person on Earth who actually does need Wi-Fi 6 in your house.
[00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:24.640]   Just because of all the crap you have running.
[00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:26.480]   You and Stacey are the two who need it.
[00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:30.600]   I may be an outlier today, but I think it's coming for a lot of people.
[00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:33.120]   I mean, yes, of course.
[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:35.640]   I mean, Comcast is talking about the average.
[00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:36.640]   Right.
[00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:38.640]   Right, I mean, but that's...
[00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:40.880]   I mean, we're on the upper end of average.
[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:41.880]   Yeah, baby.
[00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:43.600]   Ah, so title.
[00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:44.600]   We are not.
[00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:45.800]   The upper end of average.
[00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:46.800]   Yeah.
[00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:47.800]   Yeah.
[00:14:47.800 --> 00:14:48.800]   I'm upper average.
[00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:49.800]   Thank you very much.
[00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:51.800]   All right.
[00:14:51.800 --> 00:14:54.320]   So this will be in the new Pixel 2 to get back to Pixel Book 2.
[00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:57.560]   It will be in the new Pixel Book 2 code, named Atlas.
[00:14:57.560 --> 00:15:00.720]   No, I'm sorry.
[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:04.320]   This all came up because I said I don't see it in the specs for the Pixel Book 2, so
[00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:06.320]   maybe it won't be.
[00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:10.920]   Why do you need a new Pixel Book?
[00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:12.560]   Is yours wearing out, Jeff?
[00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:17.440]   Mine's two years old, and it's starting to do occasionally flaky things in the video,
[00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:21.760]   and I use it just every minute of every day.
[00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:27.680]   So in my old routine, you buy something new every week.
[00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:31.600]   I've got a little FOMO lost here just to get a new computer, so I feel...
[00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:32.600]   Oh, you want a new computer.
[00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:36.240]   Well, don't you want more processing power and horsepower in particular?
[00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:37.840]   Well, hopefully, yeah, I'll have all that too.
[00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:40.040]   If you have a Pixel Book, you've got a lot of horsepower.
[00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:41.920]   You have a lot overhead for doing what you do.
[00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:42.920]   I do.
[00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:43.920]   I love the machine.
[00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:44.920]   I've got nothing wrong with the machine now.
[00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:47.120]   It's just that I'm guessing it's going to die.
[00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:48.880]   I'd rather get something new.
[00:15:48.880 --> 00:15:49.880]   Yeah.
[00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:50.880]   By the way...
[00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:51.880]   I beat it.
[00:15:51.880 --> 00:15:56.600]   Explicitly, the FCC listing says the Pixel Book 2 does not support Wi-Fi 6.
[00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:58.840]   It is a Wi-Fi 5 device.
[00:15:58.840 --> 00:15:59.840]   That's fine.
[00:15:59.840 --> 00:16:00.840]   I'm not taking it to Stadia.
[00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:01.840]   Right.
[00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:03.360]   Again, we should be okay with that.
[00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:04.440]   Well, I'm not.
[00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:06.160]   I want the latest.
[00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:07.160]   I want to act.
[00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:08.160]   All right.
[00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:09.160]   Well, this isn't you.
[00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:10.160]   That's not me.
[00:16:10.160 --> 00:16:12.120]   But here's the thing.
[00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:18.200]   What I wanted, of course, as you know, is LTE, because my intention was to get a Fi
[00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:19.480]   data SIM.
[00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:20.920]   Is that all going to go away now?
[00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:24.720]   Is Fi going to just become another phone company?
[00:16:24.720 --> 00:16:29.680]   No, I think that was the impression I got when they announced this new flat pricing,
[00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:34.560]   the $80 a month flat pricing, because it's a terrible deal unless you know you're going
[00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:35.560]   to get used all those games.
[00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:38.160]   They are not killing what we use.
[00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:39.160]   Oh, okay.
[00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:40.160]   Yeah.
[00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:41.160]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:45.280]   They have an unlimited plan, but that's more so that they can say to people who are going
[00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:48.680]   to Verizon, well ours is 10 bucks less, you know.
[00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:51.000]   They say consumers understand that better.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   But the existing plan, which has, I can't remember the name of it, it's not unlimited.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:57.520]   It's the other one.
[00:16:57.520 --> 00:16:59.400]   Pay as you go sort of is going to stay.
[00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:01.480]   And that's honestly a great deal.
[00:17:01.480 --> 00:17:05.000]   They said one reason consumers don't like it is that they don't know what they're going
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.800]   to pay every month.
[00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:08.800]   That's dumb.
[00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:09.800]   So you'll overpay.
[00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:11.280]   So it's the same amount every month.
[00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:12.440]   Yeah, that makes no sense.
[00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:16.200]   If this is why people get excited about tax refunds every time something like dude, you
[00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:18.160]   just let the government have your money for money.
[00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:19.160]   You're lending money.
[00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:20.160]   That's your money.
[00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:21.160]   You're getting back.
[00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:22.720]   But it's just a consumer.
[00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:23.800]   It's easier to think about.
[00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:24.800]   I get it.
[00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:25.800]   I get it.
[00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:27.160]   Wasn't there some type of flexible.
[00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:28.160]   Flexible.
[00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:29.160]   Get capper.
[00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:30.880]   So that actually that's 22 gig.
[00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:31.880]   They throttle you back.
[00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:32.880]   Yeah.
[00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:33.880]   It's 22.
[00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:34.880]   Same for unlimited by the way.
[00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:35.880]   Most places.
[00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:38.200]   Who uses it the same as Verizon?
[00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:42.760]   Really the as far as I can think the only reason they do that is so you don't use it
[00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:43.760]   as residential internet.
[00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:47.520]   Because you'd have to be doing that to get that much data.
[00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:53.080]   I once did Twig from a show on my phone because the broadband in the press room was so bad.
[00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:59.040]   And it was I used I think five to six gigabytes streaming the show.
[00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:00.040]   I'm sorry.
[00:18:00.040 --> 00:18:03.880]   And my you know we got a note from our plan like you're out of in my daughter thought
[00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:05.880]   it was her and she kept like.
[00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:06.880]   Oh my god.
[00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:08.880]   That happened to me.
[00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:12.480]   Oh not airplane mode everywhere she went.
[00:18:12.480 --> 00:18:13.880]   I felt so bad for that.
[00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:16.760]   We told her it was us but she was like I thought it was me.
[00:18:16.760 --> 00:18:18.160]   God you have a nice daughter.
[00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:22.560]   That happened to me at CES one year when I was uploading a lot of doing a lot of live
[00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:27.520]   streams and just uploading a lot of content and everybody in the house was getting that
[00:18:27.520 --> 00:18:29.720]   notification and my son was freaking out.
[00:18:29.720 --> 00:18:32.360]   He's like well I promised that I wasn't doing anything.
[00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:37.520]   So and I it's going to be the Leo and aunt on the road show at CES this year.
[00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:44.000]   It's going to be and the plan is to use probably the new iPhone to shoot a bunch of interviews
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:49.600]   and then just upload them as we go which means I'm going to use I'm on T mobile.
[00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:51.000]   Will that be how it's going to be all right.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:53.920]   I think you need multiple plans for something like that.
[00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:57.160]   Maybe well I will I can bring different Sims and multiple phones.
[00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:58.680]   You will have five phones in this pocket.
[00:18:58.680 --> 00:18:59.680]   I will.
[00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:03.480]   Well for just one phone and several Sims which I know that's a good idea.
[00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:04.640]   You're a good thinking Stacy.
[00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:11.760]   Yeah and I will also limit video streaming video to incoming to 480p.
[00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:14.640]   Yeah yeah that's what everybody does with these quote unlimited plans.
[00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:18.680]   So I do hope it's not a sign that Phi the Phi model isn't working for Google.
[00:19:18.680 --> 00:19:20.560]   That's what they're going to be moving you to unlimited.
[00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:21.560]   I love it.
[00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:22.560]   Yeah.
[00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:26.400]   So the only thing I have a second phone I use it when I'm out of town it's worth it for
[00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:30.800]   me to keep it going just for that reason but if they raise the price or become a regular
[00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:33.000]   plan then I'm I'm stuck.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.640]   All right.
[00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:36.240]   Well then you switch over to T mobile.
[00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:38.560]   Well then I've got to get rid of no actually do.
[00:19:38.560 --> 00:19:40.280]   Or you could do like teen or something like that.
[00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:43.440]   Ting our sponsor by the way Mint mobile is a great deal.
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:49.120]   So Mint Mobile is I paid 300 you pay at front a whole year.
[00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:55.800]   So I paid 300 bucks for a year of 12 gigabytes a month for a year and then unlimited phone
[00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:56.800]   calls international.
[00:19:56.800 --> 00:19:59.280]   No they're right on T mobile.
[00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:00.520]   That's why I have five.
[00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:05.160]   Yeah Phi is the thing for that's by the way and this is purely on a personal note but
[00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:08.040]   I'm disappointed that Google's event is on the 15th because I won't be able to get a
[00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:09.680]   Pixel 4 for my drip.
[00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:12.000]   I'm leaving and on the 21st.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:17.120]   I'm really bummed unless they have them that day which they nobody.
[00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:18.120]   They won't.
[00:20:18.120 --> 00:20:19.120]   Yeah.
[00:20:19.120 --> 00:20:23.640]   Pixel 4 will be doing its own face ID at Google.
[00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:26.880]   I don't know if are they going to still have fingerprint.
[00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:28.600]   I don't know.
[00:20:28.600 --> 00:20:29.600]   I hope so.
[00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:30.600]   I hope so.
[00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:32.280]   I don't want the face crap.
[00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:33.280]   Yeah.
[00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:34.280]   I'd rather have the fingerprint.
[00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:39.040]   They've teased the face ID and this will be using the project solely technology.
[00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:43.920]   They've teased it with a little video that shows that you can it'll recognize you just
[00:20:43.920 --> 00:20:47.800]   at an angle and then there's this new hand gestures which again I don't know.
[00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:48.800]   gimmick gimmick.
[00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:49.800]   Yeah.
[00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:53.600]   But you know I'm still sad that solely isn't available in the net.
[00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:54.600]   Yes, hub.
[00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:58.200]   Oh, by the way, did you get your hub max yet?
[00:20:58.200 --> 00:20:59.360]   No, I did.
[00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:00.840]   I love it.
[00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:04.000]   I ordered I thought I finished ordering it but I didn't.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   Oh, no.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   So I got it.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.560]   I had it for a few days.
[00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:10.240]   It's it's the speakers disappointing.
[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:13.960]   It's not as good as the Echo Show even the original Echo Show.
[00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:15.600]   It's okay but it's not great.
[00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:16.800]   I was hoping for better.
[00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:18.440]   You've got a bigger device.
[00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:22.840]   The screen though is beautiful and it's it's because I love the little one I have on my
[00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:24.840]   bedside table that one doesn't have a camera.
[00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:26.160]   This one does.
[00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:29.920]   If you turn on face side recognition which I did.
[00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:35.440]   It's a little creepy when you walk when you walk up to it says oh, hi Leo.
[00:21:35.440 --> 00:21:36.440]   Oh, no.
[00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:39.600]   It knows you're there.
[00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:41.200]   It starts showing you your count.
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:43.080]   It goes here's what you got today.
[00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:44.080]   Oh, no.
[00:21:44.080 --> 00:21:45.520]   Here's your specially customized news.
[00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:47.600]   The whole thing is completely customized for me.
[00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:50.440]   I dig that if it wasn't scanning my face.
[00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:52.440]   So how else is it going to do that?
[00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:53.440]   Yeah, it's terrible.
[00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:54.440]   It was recognition.
[00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:56.600]   So this is a good option.
[00:21:56.600 --> 00:22:00.320]   I like it but we've talked many times on the show about the creepy line.
[00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:02.360]   It's right up against it.
[00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:04.120]   And straddles the creepy line.
[00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:05.120]   It's choice.
[00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:06.120]   But I turned on.
[00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:07.120]   You have to turn it on.
[00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:08.120]   It's not on by default.
[00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:09.120]   No, that's good.
[00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:10.120]   Yeah.
[00:22:10.120 --> 00:22:11.120]   I've been.
[00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:14.400]   And I have to say so I thought well if I'm going to get that I should get the hello doorbell
[00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:19.080]   replace the ring to see how the nest is different because it's always on right.
[00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:20.400]   Stacey that's the big difference.
[00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:24.840]   It's unlike the ring which has to kind of turn on and there so this is lag.
[00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:27.960]   So you can remember if it's always on but it's definitely faster.
[00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:29.520]   Hello is always on the ring.
[00:22:29.520 --> 00:22:30.520]   It is.
[00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:31.520]   Okay.
[00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:33.800]   I get the UPS guys but most of the time as he's leaving.
[00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:35.680]   How's that about though?
[00:22:35.680 --> 00:22:37.280]   Well those shorts are very flattering.
[00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:41.880]   I'm like that's a thing for a reason.
[00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:46.400]   So but you know the camera is pretty much it looks the same.
[00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:48.480]   It's very wide angle.
[00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:56.000]   I like it though that I can say to my nest Max stream the front door and it just sits
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:00.680]   on it's there or stream and I have now kind of nest cameras everywhere.
[00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:02.000]   I kind of want to.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.760]   For years I laughed at people who had cameras.
[00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:05.120]   I said just making you nervous.
[00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:06.120]   There's no reason.
[00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:07.120]   And now I kind of like it.
[00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:09.120]   I can see what's going on everywhere.
[00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:12.360]   There's somebody at our front door right now.
[00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:14.440]   You know that kind of thing.
[00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:16.920]   You talked about the speaker on it.
[00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:18.680]   What expectations do you have?
[00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:21.720]   Oh you mean for the nest up my home hub next Max thing.
[00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:22.720]   Yeah.
[00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:25.920]   Well it should sound as good as the Echo show.
[00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:27.680]   It's there it's their version of the Echo show.
[00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:29.920]   I just don't think any of them should sound good.
[00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:32.560]   You know I mean it has a nice it should have a decent base.
[00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:33.560]   It doesn't.
[00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:34.560]   It's okay.
[00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:35.560]   I'm going to buy one.
[00:23:35.560 --> 00:23:38.800]   I figured you should sound like a beach speaker.
[00:23:38.800 --> 00:23:39.800]   That's it.
[00:23:39.800 --> 00:23:40.800]   No more.
[00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:41.800]   No.
[00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:43.040]   It sounds like a low end beach speaker.
[00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:45.200]   Some have more more a little more base.
[00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:46.200]   Wow.
[00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:48.200]   We're going to do a hot review.
[00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:50.880]   You can hear it from themselves.
[00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:51.880]   How does that sound?
[00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:52.880]   I don't know what to say.
[00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:53.880]   That sounds pretty good.
[00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:54.880]   I'm going to have to compare them.
[00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:56.200]   So if audio is important.
[00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:59.880]   I think you should get the Lenovo rather than the Google.
[00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:01.200]   But the Google seems to have more features.
[00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:02.600]   You could do duo calling.
[00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:05.080]   I could do duo calling on the Lenovo.
[00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:07.040]   Maybe it isn't more features.
[00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:11.400]   They did say that it's not the same technology that Lenovo uses.
[00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:15.400]   It's more like a Chromecast technology in the Google version or the nest version.
[00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:16.400]   Which is weird.
[00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:17.400]   Wow.
[00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:18.400]   Okay.
[00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:22.000]   I like it.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:29.120]   I think it's, you know, I, but I see maybe I'm an outlier because I loved the Echo Show
[00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:30.120]   when it came out.
[00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:31.720]   I thought this is the best one ever.
[00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:32.720]   This is so great.
[00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:37.480]   I love having a screen with the reason I had the, you know, the Echo shows because I could
[00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:41.200]   say show my ring doorbell because they're both Amazon.
[00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:42.760]   So I thought, well, I should get the hello.
[00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:43.760]   Right.
[00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:44.760]   Just to tie it up again.
[00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:46.520]   Little issue on the hello and I don't know.
[00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:48.280]   Do you have a hello to Stacy?
[00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:49.280]   I used to.
[00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:50.280]   I don't on this house.
[00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:53.280]   Supposed to do people recognition.
[00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:54.280]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:24:54.280 --> 00:24:56.080]   It's starting to do it now.
[00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:58.880]   It's only recognized one person so far.
[00:24:58.880 --> 00:24:59.880]   You have to train it.
[00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:00.880]   You have to train it.
[00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:01.880]   Yeah, I'm going to train it now.
[00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:03.880]   So that's, that's Michael.
[00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:04.880]   That's a dog.
[00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:08.960]   And then it says it hasn't seen anyone new yet once they do return to the screen.
[00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:10.560]   Now I've had it in place for a week.
[00:25:10.560 --> 00:25:13.280]   It should have seen a lot of new people.
[00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:15.840]   Did you just stopped into it or maybe it just.
[00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:17.320]   That's the other thing it says.
[00:25:17.320 --> 00:25:19.080]   This may be illegal in some jurisdiction.
[00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:21.440]   Yeah, I wanted to ask you that.
[00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:23.560]   What are the implications of someone?
[00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:26.440]   It says find out what the laws are and you're, you're okay.
[00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:31.800]   So this is an interesting punt because when I had an alarm company install a doorbell
[00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:36.800]   for me, so I had Vivint come install their doorbell about two years ago in my old house,
[00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:40.760]   what I found most interesting is they actually forced me to put up a little sticker that
[00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:47.760]   said this premises is monitored video or whatever Google, they send those ring sends
[00:25:47.760 --> 00:25:51.640]   them in their box, but they don't require you to put that up in.
[00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:54.880]   I was very curious because the Vivint guy was like, yeah, you have to put that up if
[00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:55.880]   you've got a camera.
[00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:58.080]   I, they're on my freaking property.
[00:25:58.080 --> 00:25:59.640]   Depends per state though.
[00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:00.640]   It's per yeah.
[00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:01.960]   Here's what here's what the only have to do that.
[00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:03.320]   I know you have to do that in Washington.
[00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:06.120]   I don't think you have to do that in California.
[00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:10.080]   Here's what the language is use this feature in compliance with the law.
[00:26:10.080 --> 00:26:13.160]   Depending on where you live, you might need to get the consent of people visiting your
[00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:14.160]   home.
[00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:18.360]   I don't know how you would get consent before you just, well, what you do is you just put
[00:26:18.360 --> 00:26:20.360]   a sign up with the outside of you like we do at the school.
[00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:23.080]   If you enter this home, you're going to be videoed recorded.
[00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:24.080]   Right.
[00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:25.080]   We have that in the city.
[00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:26.080]   Yeah.
[00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:27.520]   I want to say, Megan Maroney did that.
[00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:33.080]   She just stuck signs up just to see why I guess it would have a good deterrent, but I
[00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:34.080]   don't know.
[00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:35.080]   I don't want to do that.
[00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:38.200]   That seems kind of weird, but it's not weird to.
[00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:39.200]   We're watching you.
[00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:40.720]   They're on my property.
[00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:41.720]   They're on my property.
[00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:44.000]   Can't I take a picture of them on my property?
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.160]   Wherever you have at the flood sign in.
[00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:49.600]   It's not just your property though.
[00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:54.440]   Here's an example we used actually to talk about like nest or sorry, about ring in the
[00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:56.240]   deals with police departments.
[00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:59.640]   You can sometimes, not every case, see other people's property.
[00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:03.280]   Well, if you're a neighbor across the street, just smoke and weed on a porch.
[00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:04.440]   I don't see that.
[00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:09.440]   But I mean, I could see the drive and I could see the street out front.
[00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:10.440]   Right.
[00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:11.440]   The street out front.
[00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:12.440]   But then I don't see anybody's face.
[00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:13.440]   I'm the car.
[00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:14.440]   It doesn't matter.
[00:27:14.440 --> 00:27:15.440]   It doesn't matter.
[00:27:15.440 --> 00:27:16.440]   Okay.
[00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:17.440]   I know.
[00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:18.440]   I understand.
[00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:19.440]   This is.
[00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:22.040]   But there's a difference between way, way, way far away is the other.
[00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:24.040]   We're talking about legality now.
[00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:25.040]   Yeah.
[00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:28.120]   Well, yes, but there's also like this.
[00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:32.440]   One of the issues with something like having a doorbell cam like this that is accessible,
[00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:36.440]   like whose files are accessible to law enforcement is they can look for that.
[00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:41.160]   Like they could do something like face recognition for it.
[00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:42.160]   Let's say an immigrant.
[00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:44.840]   Maybe they're maybe it's ICE trying to find people.
[00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:47.640]   That's the difference in the police having it.
[00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:50.040]   I'm not sharing this with law enforcement.
[00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:53.720]   This is just legal for police in California to use that.
[00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:56.360]   Well, by the way, that's going to become a campaign issue.
[00:27:56.360 --> 00:28:00.000]   I think some of the Democratic candidates for president have already said, I think it's
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.400]   Bernie Sanders has already said we want to make it illegal.
[00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:04.720]   And every jurisdiction for police to use face recognition.
[00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:06.080]   We have a story about it.
[00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:07.840]   Which just drives me nuts.
[00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:08.840]   Yes.
[00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:10.880]   It seems like a useful policing tool.
[00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:11.880]   It does.
[00:28:11.880 --> 00:28:16.520]   Well, and not just policing, but again, I keep on the same examples missing children, missing
[00:28:16.520 --> 00:28:17.520]   Alzheimer's patients.
[00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:22.160]   There are legitimate criminals who just shot up a bunch of people because we have guns
[00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:23.920]   in this country.
[00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:26.760]   The technology is not what the problem is that if you have problems with the police,
[00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:27.840]   you have problems with the police.
[00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:29.840]   Yes, that's true.
[00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:35.240]   I would recommend a moratorium until they figure out how to how to do this.
[00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:36.240]   For how to do this.
[00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:43.520]   Yeah, the rules and how to use them and they and fish until facial recognition gets better
[00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:45.320]   at the biggest problem.
[00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:53.080]   There is a great piece by Benedict Evans from and recent Horowitz in the rundown about
[00:28:53.080 --> 00:28:55.120]   just this.
[00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:57.680]   And he bends that Ben's brilliant.
[00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:02.320]   And if you don't follow Ben on Twitter and get his email newsletter, I'm telling you
[00:29:02.320 --> 00:29:03.320]   you want to.
[00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:11.640]   Well, Ben says he goes back and he looks at how there were similar fears around databases.
[00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:17.120]   And when you got something wrong in a database, there were all kinds of books at the time,
[00:29:17.120 --> 00:29:18.120]   right?
[00:29:18.120 --> 00:29:19.120]   Data banks and a free society.
[00:29:19.120 --> 00:29:21.840]   People are still dealing with database problems, though, Jeff.
[00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:23.720]   Look at the no fly list.
[00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:25.920]   That is a perfect example of that.
[00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:30.880]   And then goes through that and he says, yes, there are examples of these kinds of mistakes
[00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:32.440]   and those mistakes are there.
[00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:36.560]   Yes, but that doesn't mean that we eliminate all databases.
[00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:41.280]   Okay, we're not eliminating facial recognition.
[00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:48.360]   We're saying that we should put a moratorium on using facial recognition for policing purposes
[00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:50.000]   in various cities.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:53.720]   And cities themselves are voting on this local municipalities.
[00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:56.320]   This isn't even a federal or even a statewide.
[00:29:56.320 --> 00:29:58.120]   It's banned in San Francisco.
[00:29:58.120 --> 00:29:59.120]   It's a panic.
[00:29:59.120 --> 00:30:00.120]   Moral panic.
[00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:01.120]   Right.
[00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:05.520]   So, but these these citizens are they're saying that this is what they want.
[00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:07.920]   Is there a drug that by moral panic?
[00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:11.520]   Yeah, Jeff, no, because the technology is not very.
[00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:12.520]   Is that ready?
[00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:14.320]   Yeah, facial recognition technology.
[00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:15.320]   Who knows?
[00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:16.720]   Listen, folks, I'm sorry.
[00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:22.960]   But if you have a relative who has Alzheimer's, it's fine for you to say, oh, no, but sorry,
[00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:25.800]   we can't find you because it's not taking another two years to get this ready.
[00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:27.400]   It's not the, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:28.400]   Let me just finish one second.
[00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:29.400]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:30.400]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:31.400]   You interrupt me with your moral panic stuff.
[00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:35.320]   I'm going to finish telling you why facial recognition is not awesome.
[00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:38.260]   One, it doesn't work the way you're saying it works.
[00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:42.320]   You don't just feed in someone's face and then all the cameras in the city.
[00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:44.300]   This is not my minority report yet.
[00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:46.040]   So that's one, Jeff.
[00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:52.020]   Two, the way that police departments have been using it in this is documented in New York
[00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:57.780]   City and other places is not, it is an overreach.
[00:30:57.780 --> 00:31:03.420]   It is not using the technology in a way that is catching people, catching the bright people.
[00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:04.420]   The right.
[00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:05.420]   So that's what you're trying to make.
[00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:06.420]   Right.
[00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:07.420]   And that's what we're saying.
[00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:10.420]   What you regulate that is, no, you say.
[00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:12.460]   Can I get a note?
[00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:14.980]   I don't think that has anything to do with moral.
[00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:20.540]   Let's just, whether it's, it's right or wrong that the tech is not there yet.
[00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:21.620]   It's just not there.
[00:31:21.620 --> 00:31:23.940]   It's, it's, listen, look at this way.
[00:31:23.940 --> 00:31:26.300]   It's input data, right?
[00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:30.900]   A witness tells you that person just stole something, right?
[00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:33.820]   That person could be lying, that person could write, that person could be wrong.
[00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:38.060]   What you do with that piece of information, that one piece of data, so and so says, so
[00:31:38.060 --> 00:31:41.820]   and so stole something is what a justice system is all about.
[00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:44.340]   But it's just one piece of data and we have structures to look through that.
[00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:46.860]   Can I, in this case, in this case, can I do this?
[00:31:46.860 --> 00:31:48.500]   In this case, you have one piece of data.
[00:31:48.500 --> 00:31:49.500]   This is the case.
[00:31:49.500 --> 00:31:50.900]   The computer says this person looks like this person.
[00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:54.900]   Well, then you got plenty of ways to say it either is or is not that person.
[00:31:54.900 --> 00:31:57.900]   If you go shoot somebody because of it, yes, that'd be wrong.
[00:31:57.900 --> 00:32:00.900]   If you, if you, if you, the rest of them, put them in jail for the rest of their lives,
[00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:01.900]   that'd be wrong.
[00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:04.300]   But we have justice systems to deal with data.
[00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:07.300]   Do the police screw things up and are they off of them and all the one, especially around
[00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:08.300]   race?
[00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:09.300]   Yes, that's the problem.
[00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:15.980]   What if you replace the word face recognition with fingerprints?
[00:32:15.980 --> 00:32:18.020]   Because there are fingerprints aren't perfect.
[00:32:18.020 --> 00:32:19.460]   There are false positives.
[00:32:19.460 --> 00:32:22.420]   Some people don't have fingerprints.
[00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:27.460]   Fingerprints are a very useful law enforcement tool, however.
[00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:33.660]   And I think with fingerprints, you have that kind of protection that you're talking about,
[00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:34.660]   Jeff.
[00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:37.380]   Nobody just relies solely on fingerprints.
[00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:40.460]   But, but isn't that a useful law enforcement tool?
[00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:41.460]   Isn't that like face recognition?
[00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:42.460]   It's a whole thing.
[00:32:42.460 --> 00:32:45.220]   It's, it's, you, you regulate the use of the information.
[00:32:45.220 --> 00:32:46.220]   Sorry, I said say.
[00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:47.220]   Fingerprints are really.
[00:32:47.220 --> 00:32:48.220]   Oh.
[00:32:48.220 --> 00:32:49.220]   Go ahead, stay.
[00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:50.220]   I'm sorry.
[00:32:50.220 --> 00:32:51.220]   Go ahead.
[00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:52.220]   No, no, no, you go ahead.
[00:32:52.220 --> 00:32:56.860]   Well, fingerprints are way more reliable based on just how long we've been around and
[00:32:56.860 --> 00:32:58.620]   how long the development has been there.
[00:32:58.620 --> 00:32:59.620]   They're not perfect.
[00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:00.620]   They're not perfect.
[00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:01.620]   But I.
[00:33:01.620 --> 00:33:03.820]   They're also not as accessible.
[00:33:03.820 --> 00:33:05.340]   I'll add on to that.
[00:33:05.340 --> 00:33:12.420]   So if I'm trying, so to get a fingerprint that actually requires you send a person out
[00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:14.420]   and dust for prints.
[00:33:14.420 --> 00:33:16.220]   And that, that is much less.
[00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:18.220]   So again, I want to tie this back.
[00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:20.220]   This is just a better way to do it.
[00:33:20.220 --> 00:33:22.220]   Because it's easier and faster.
[00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:25.740]   Well, but that kills your privacy in a lot of ways.
[00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:28.220]   So that's that ambient privacy idea.
[00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:34.220]   So if I can pull out this and if you had my face on your camera, that's a lot better,
[00:33:34.220 --> 00:33:35.220]   right?
[00:33:35.220 --> 00:33:37.700]   To actually try to match it against faces in the system.
[00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:41.220]   What the police are doing now is they're saying someone will say like, oh, the Woody
[00:33:41.220 --> 00:33:42.660]   Harrelson guy actually.
[00:33:42.660 --> 00:33:44.980]   This guy looked like Woody Harrelson.
[00:33:44.980 --> 00:33:47.580]   And so they ran faces of Woody Harrelson.
[00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:50.980]   They ran against Woody Harrelson to find this particular person.
[00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:51.980]   Did they find him?
[00:33:51.980 --> 00:33:52.980]   Yes.
[00:33:52.980 --> 00:33:54.660]   Is that a great way to use this?
[00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:55.660]   No.
[00:33:55.660 --> 00:33:57.300]   No, but you have to trust.
[00:33:57.300 --> 00:34:02.580]   I think Benedict is right in the sense that the real issue is not lack of trust in the
[00:34:02.580 --> 00:34:03.580]   technology.
[00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:05.500]   It's a lack of trust in police.
[00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:06.500]   And just.
[00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:07.500]   Yes, that is true.
[00:34:07.500 --> 00:34:09.500]   I mean, it's the same problem with the Woody Harrelson thing.
[00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:11.300]   That seems like a crappy idea.
[00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:12.780]   But you can't do the same thing.
[00:34:12.780 --> 00:34:13.780]   But that's all they had.
[00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:14.780]   It worked.
[00:34:14.780 --> 00:34:17.100]   No, the rest of the police process.
[00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:19.260]   It worked effectively.
[00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:22.380]   You can't give people who aren't ready for the tools, the tool.
[00:34:22.380 --> 00:34:24.540]   And that's what these moratoriums are trying to do.
[00:34:24.540 --> 00:34:28.140]   They're saying, you know what, you're not trustworthy enough to have this as a tool.
[00:34:28.140 --> 00:34:31.300]   And I don't think that's that's not a wrong thing to say.
[00:34:31.300 --> 00:34:34.260]   But again, if we can what, right?
[00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:35.260]   Let's let's take out crime.
[00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:36.420]   Let's take out crime for a second.
[00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:37.420]   All right.
[00:34:37.420 --> 00:34:42.220]   Would you be okay if they use this technology for missing children?
[00:34:42.220 --> 00:34:47.780]   Or if Tay Tay used this at her concert to block stalkers from getting into the concert.
[00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:48.780]   If you could pass that.
[00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:50.860]   So Tay Tay is an interesting thing because that's private.
[00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:52.660]   You can opt into that.
[00:34:52.660 --> 00:34:58.140]   So using it for missing children, it depends on how they use it.
[00:34:58.140 --> 00:35:00.220]   And it depends on where that data goes.
[00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:01.780]   So the point is way better.
[00:35:01.780 --> 00:35:04.100]   It does depend on the situation.
[00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:05.100]   Use.
[00:35:05.100 --> 00:35:06.340]   It depends on the use of the text.
[00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:07.820]   It doesn't just depend on the use.
[00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:09.060]   So it depends on the use.
[00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:10.740]   It depends on who has access.
[00:35:10.740 --> 00:35:15.620]   Like would I give this to an organization that isn't like the police?
[00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:16.820]   Actually maybe.
[00:35:16.820 --> 00:35:21.060]   So that's why I would give it to Taylor Swift, you know, to go see her concerts.
[00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:24.300]   She's far more trustworthy than our local police department.
[00:35:24.300 --> 00:35:26.860]   I'm just I mean, these are.
[00:35:26.860 --> 00:35:32.340]   I get to a swim because in armed everybody does not need all of that particular power.
[00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:38.860]   I don't think it's unreasonable to say let's slow down or let's have a moratorium.
[00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:40.220]   I think that is not an unreleased.
[00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:41.820]   Who says when it's ready?
[00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:43.620]   Who's the God of ready?
[00:35:43.620 --> 00:35:45.180]   The citizens.
[00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:47.620]   That's why they're being decided at the municipal level.
[00:35:47.620 --> 00:35:49.060]   We're always the God of ready.
[00:35:49.060 --> 00:35:52.340]   We're being pumped up by moral panic.
[00:35:52.340 --> 00:35:55.380]   Before we leave Benedict's piece, can I just point out this neat chart he has in there,
[00:35:55.380 --> 00:35:59.140]   which he gave credit for, which I think is really nice expression of machine learning
[00:35:59.140 --> 00:36:01.940]   just for future use for PowerPoint, folks.
[00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:02.940]   Yes.
[00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:05.260]   So classical programming, I've said this for a long time.
[00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:06.260]   This is my definition.
[00:36:06.260 --> 00:36:10.180]   This is actually my definition of artificial intelligence.
[00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:14.380]   Normal programming, you give it the programmer gives it rules, then gives it data.
[00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:18.660]   The computer program applies the rules to the data, results in an answer.
[00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:20.780]   That's algorithmic programming.
[00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:24.420]   I think a lot of what we call AI is actually that.
[00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:29.820]   Real AI, real machine learning, you give it a ton of data, you give it answers.
[00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:32.660]   So you say these are all bananas.
[00:36:32.660 --> 00:36:39.060]   Then it generates its own rules for picking bananas from hot dogs.
[00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:42.420]   And I think that is very useful for everybody.
[00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:43.420]   It's a nice little chart.
[00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:44.420]   It's kind of an every person.
[00:36:44.420 --> 00:36:45.660]   It's also bedwell on way to understand that.
[00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:46.660]   He found this.
[00:36:46.660 --> 00:36:48.820]   And he said, "Does anybody know who did this?"
[00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:52.180]   Sure enough, Francois Chule did and he put credit in.
[00:36:52.180 --> 00:36:53.980]   But I think it's a very nice little PowerPointy thing.
[00:36:53.980 --> 00:36:54.980]   I just wanted to mention that.
[00:36:54.980 --> 00:36:56.740]   And it was a nice way of changing this object.
[00:36:56.740 --> 00:37:01.100]   I would also just put a button on this conversation.
[00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:06.180]   If you want more of this, more conversation about this, you can check out triangulation
[00:37:06.180 --> 00:37:08.220]   episode 400.
[00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:16.540]   We talked about the guy behind the police, San Francisco police ban on facial recognition.
[00:37:16.540 --> 00:37:18.340]   I came up with his last name.
[00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:20.940]   Yeah, that was a very interesting triangulation.
[00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:22.740]   Very good job of promo.
[00:37:22.740 --> 00:37:23.740]   Thanks, Carsten.
[00:37:23.740 --> 00:37:27.780]   I'm trying to give our other shows a little bit more.
[00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:29.500]   Do you put a button under?
[00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:31.500]   Do you put a bow on it?
[00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:35.660]   Or do you put a button in a bow kind of guy?
[00:37:35.660 --> 00:37:36.660]   I don't know.
[00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:37.660]   I'm like, wait.
[00:37:37.660 --> 00:37:40.740]   I've been saying that wrong this whole time because it happened all the time.
[00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:41.740]   It's a Harvard thing.
[00:37:41.740 --> 00:37:44.740]   You can tie a bow around it or you can put a button on it.
[00:37:44.740 --> 00:37:46.860]   I think both phrases work.
[00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:47.860]   I like button.
[00:37:47.860 --> 00:37:48.860]   That seems a little more okay.
[00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:51.380]   But I may have made that up.
[00:37:51.380 --> 00:37:56.060]   Maybe a neologism, but I'm allowed to do it because that's a part of it.
[00:37:56.060 --> 00:37:57.580]   Put a button and it is fantastic.
[00:37:57.580 --> 00:38:03.300]   Harvard is where the home of neologisms in the United States of America.
[00:38:03.300 --> 00:38:04.780]   Let's take a little break.
[00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:06.860]   You know what Mr. Harvard needs?
[00:38:06.860 --> 00:38:07.860]   It needs Grammarly.
[00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:13.580]   You know, I always said to myself, I don't need Grammarly because my Grammar is perfect.
[00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:17.980]   Then I started using Grammarly and went, oh, maybe I do need because it's more than Grammar.
[00:38:17.980 --> 00:38:18.980]   Okay.
[00:38:18.980 --> 00:38:21.900]   The basic free version of Grammarly is spelling and Grammar.
[00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:24.220]   But then there's Grammarly premium.
[00:38:24.220 --> 00:38:27.220]   That's what I've been using and I would highly recommend to everybody.
[00:38:27.220 --> 00:38:34.260]   It's an advanced punctuation checker structure style within context.
[00:38:34.260 --> 00:38:37.500]   When you're writing a business proposal, that's different than an academic essay or a blog
[00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:38.500]   post.
[00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:43.580]   So it understands that and will help you write appropriately for the venue.
[00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:46.460]   It'll give you vocabulary suggestions.
[00:38:46.460 --> 00:38:51.860]   It'll suggest, do you mean bow, not button, conciseness?
[00:38:51.860 --> 00:38:55.020]   The readability score is very useful.
[00:38:55.020 --> 00:38:57.060]   I think Grammarly is amazing.
[00:38:57.060 --> 00:39:01.460]   It is a communication tool that helps you improve your writing so you're mistake free.
[00:39:01.460 --> 00:39:05.380]   It's always good, but even better, clear and effective.
[00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:07.300]   It helps you do your best work.
[00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:11.260]   And as a result, accomplish more of your goals.

[00:39:46.660 --> 00:39:47.860]   I revere Paul Thorey.
[00:39:47.860 --> 00:39:51.060]   He's a write professional writer, great talented guy.
[00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:53.660]   I think his writing is super good.
[00:39:53.660 --> 00:39:55.540]   He recommended Grammarly the other day.
[00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:57.380]   It was his tip of the week on Windows Weekly.
[00:39:57.380 --> 00:39:58.380]   I said, "You know the response?"
[00:39:58.380 --> 00:40:00.580]   He said, "No, I did not."
[00:40:00.580 --> 00:40:01.580]   He uses it.
[00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:03.300]   That's to me that says enough.
[00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:04.300]   Grammarly.com/twig.

[00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:13.820]   Thank you Grammarly for supporting this week in Google.
[00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:15.060]   I use Grammarly.
[00:40:15.060 --> 00:40:16.060]   I totally use Grammarly.
[00:40:16.060 --> 00:40:18.300]   I thought you were the one person who doesn't use it.
[00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:19.300]   I thought you were the one person who doesn't use it.
[00:40:19.300 --> 00:40:23.100]   No, we all use it at Twit now and it's really good.
[00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:26.860]   So it always tells me I'm in the 99th percentile for...
[00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:27.860]   Me too.
[00:40:27.860 --> 00:40:28.860]   What is it?
[00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:29.860]   Productivity?
[00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:30.860]   Oh, no, no.
[00:40:30.860 --> 00:40:31.860]   I'm a number of words used.
[00:40:31.860 --> 00:40:32.860]   Oh, I'm just productivity.
[00:40:32.860 --> 00:40:34.860]   I'm like, "What does that even mention?"
[00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:35.860]   It finds...
[00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:37.860]   Yeah, whatever you're good at.
[00:40:37.860 --> 00:40:42.860]   It's really basically Stacey's just saying to you, "Man, you write a lot."
[00:40:42.860 --> 00:40:43.860]   I do.
[00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:47.860]   But it's like, "Oh, your errors are just really basic."
[00:40:47.860 --> 00:40:51.660]   I'm probably 1th percentile in productivity.
[00:40:51.660 --> 00:40:53.500]   I don't write it all.
[00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:54.500]   Okay.
[00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:56.860]   I was just curious what other people got as their...
[00:40:56.860 --> 00:41:00.780]   Yeah, you.
[00:41:00.780 --> 00:41:04.700]   The Verge says Pixel 4 is the most leaked phone ever.
[00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:06.500]   Partly with the help of Google, by the way.
[00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:07.500]   Oh, yeah.
[00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:08.500]   Oh, yeah.
[00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:09.500]   These are pro-go-go-go-go-leaks.
[00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:10.500]   Yeah.
[00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:14.860]   We now know there is going to be an orange one as well as a black and white one.
[00:41:14.860 --> 00:41:15.860]   Coral.
[00:41:15.860 --> 00:41:16.860]   Coral.
[00:41:16.860 --> 00:41:17.860]   Coral.
[00:41:17.860 --> 00:41:18.860]   No, I hate their coral.
[00:41:18.860 --> 00:41:19.860]   Never mind.
[00:41:19.860 --> 00:41:20.860]   I don't feel so bad.
[00:41:20.860 --> 00:41:21.860]   Is that really coral?
[00:41:21.860 --> 00:41:22.860]   It looks more orange.
[00:41:22.860 --> 00:41:24.860]   That's what they're calling it coral.
[00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:25.860]   They always have weird names.
[00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:28.660]   To some people, they'll mark it as the Trump phone and it'll be fine.
[00:41:28.660 --> 00:41:29.660]   Oh, gosh.
[00:41:29.660 --> 00:41:30.660]   Maybe I won't get that.
[00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:32.500]   No, orange is like my favorite color.
[00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:34.500]   It's Cheeto color.
[00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:36.860]   It's far from Cheeto.
[00:41:36.860 --> 00:41:38.620]   Big camera square around back.
[00:41:38.620 --> 00:41:39.620]   Everybody's doing it.
[00:41:39.620 --> 00:41:41.620]   Everybody's doing it now, this big bump.
[00:41:41.620 --> 00:41:43.220]   Everybody is set one plus.
[00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:44.620]   One plus doesn't seem to...
[00:41:44.620 --> 00:41:46.380]   No, I love the one plus too.
[00:41:46.380 --> 00:41:47.380]   They don't even have a notch.
[00:41:47.380 --> 00:41:49.380]   They don't even have anything.
[00:41:49.380 --> 00:41:52.740]   Does it have to bump because the phone's too thin for...
[00:41:52.740 --> 00:41:53.740]   Yeah.
[00:41:53.740 --> 00:41:58.700]   It turns out the quality of the phone is somewhat reliant on the depth that the camera has,
[00:41:58.700 --> 00:41:59.900]   the lens to the sensor.
[00:41:59.900 --> 00:42:03.380]   So all of the better phones now.
[00:42:03.380 --> 00:42:04.580]   By the way, I loved it.
[00:42:04.580 --> 00:42:08.460]   John Gruber today and Daring Fireball said, "Why don't they just call it the eye camera
[00:42:08.460 --> 00:42:09.460]   and be done with it?"
[00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:13.060]   They didn't even mention that it makes phone calls at the apple of it.
[00:42:13.060 --> 00:42:15.740]   Does anybody use their phone to make phone calls?
[00:42:15.740 --> 00:42:17.220]   It's a camera, right?
[00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:21.380]   So as the cameras get better on these eye cameras, you're going to see these bumps just
[00:42:21.380 --> 00:42:22.380]   because you need this.
[00:42:22.380 --> 00:42:24.380]   These are just the eye camera.
[00:42:24.380 --> 00:42:27.820]   They just call the eye camera and be done with it.
[00:42:27.820 --> 00:42:29.540]   Is there a fingerprint reader?
[00:42:29.540 --> 00:42:31.060]   Even with all the leaks, we still don't know.
[00:42:31.060 --> 00:42:35.100]   We do know the project solely will be used for better face recognition.
[00:42:35.100 --> 00:42:40.020]   I'm not a fan of face recognition, mostly because it works pretty well in almost all
[00:42:40.020 --> 00:42:41.020]   environments.
[00:42:41.020 --> 00:42:44.100]   But the one time my iPhone, I can't ever get to wake it up is when my face is on the
[00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:45.700]   pillow squished like that.
[00:42:45.700 --> 00:42:46.700]   All right.
[00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:48.340]   And then it says, "I don't know.
[00:42:48.340 --> 00:42:49.340]   What are you a dog?
[00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:50.340]   What are you?"
[00:42:50.340 --> 00:42:51.340]   You know, are you a court?
[00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:53.340]   I don't recognize you.
[00:42:53.340 --> 00:42:55.340]   Are you having a stroke?
[00:42:55.340 --> 00:42:57.380]   Are you having a stroke?
[00:42:57.380 --> 00:43:01.620]   So it's not good in bed at night, but every other place, it seems to work pretty well.
[00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:03.140]   I've kind of gotten, you know, used to.
[00:43:03.140 --> 00:43:04.380]   I wish it had both.
[00:43:04.380 --> 00:43:05.740]   Just give me a fingerprint scanner.
[00:43:05.740 --> 00:43:06.740]   Yeah.
[00:43:06.740 --> 00:43:08.260]   It works so well on the Pixel 3.
[00:43:08.260 --> 00:43:09.260]   It's so good.
[00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:10.260]   You're a Pixel 3 guy, right?
[00:43:10.260 --> 00:43:11.260]   I am.
[00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:12.260]   Yeah.
[00:43:12.260 --> 00:43:15.740]   I told Aunt yesterday that you're going to be a Pixel 4 guy.
[00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:17.260]   He was happy to hear that.
[00:43:17.260 --> 00:43:19.300]   I was happy to hear it.
[00:43:19.300 --> 00:43:24.980]   We told him when you were gone to just look very poor and whiny about how he really would
[00:43:24.980 --> 00:43:25.980]   be.
[00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:26.980]   He has to have a Pixel 4.
[00:43:26.980 --> 00:43:27.980]   He has to have a Pixel 4.
[00:43:27.980 --> 00:43:28.980]   Really nice to have a 4.
[00:43:28.980 --> 00:43:31.340]   We have a good division here of people who use iPhones and Android phones, but we do make
[00:43:31.340 --> 00:43:35.460]   sure we keep parity so that, you know, the Android phones are well represented.
[00:43:35.460 --> 00:43:37.220]   Was that your excuse, Aunt?
[00:43:37.220 --> 00:43:38.220]   I'm sorry.
[00:43:38.220 --> 00:43:40.460]   I'll do Android if you were using Windows.
[00:43:40.460 --> 00:43:41.460]   Oh my God.
[00:43:41.460 --> 00:43:44.820]   And I'm like, the only person using Windows at the studio as well.
[00:43:44.820 --> 00:43:45.820]   Pretty much.
[00:43:45.820 --> 00:43:47.620]   Oh, yeah, because Paul's not at the...
[00:43:47.620 --> 00:43:48.620]   No.
[00:43:48.620 --> 00:43:52.100]   So is the coral, is that going to be like a Clemson orange?
[00:43:52.100 --> 00:43:53.940]   That's what I'm hoping.
[00:43:53.940 --> 00:43:54.940]   That's what I'm hoping.
[00:43:54.940 --> 00:43:55.940]   That's what I'm hoping.
[00:43:55.940 --> 00:43:56.940]   That's my kid.
[00:43:56.940 --> 00:43:57.940]   That's Aunt's dream.
[00:43:57.940 --> 00:43:58.940]   He's put a little tiger paw on that.
[00:43:58.940 --> 00:43:59.940]   Put a little hole on it.
[00:43:59.940 --> 00:44:01.580]   And that one on the screen and on the back.
[00:44:01.580 --> 00:44:02.580]   Yeah, that had...
[00:44:02.580 --> 00:44:05.740]   The added in Times Square is not looking quite that orange.
[00:44:05.740 --> 00:44:07.100]   Oh, we should see that.
[00:44:07.100 --> 00:44:08.300]   Yeah, because they...
[00:44:08.300 --> 00:44:13.180]   Google, really leaning into the leaks has now posted.
[00:44:13.180 --> 00:44:17.620]   And a big add on Times Square with the picture of the coral phone.
[00:44:17.620 --> 00:44:20.940]   So it's not leaning in when you're sending these units out.
[00:44:20.940 --> 00:44:21.940]   I still believe they're sending those.
[00:44:21.940 --> 00:44:22.940]   That's not a leak.
[00:44:22.940 --> 00:44:23.940]   That is early PR.
[00:44:23.940 --> 00:44:24.940]   Yeah.
[00:44:24.940 --> 00:44:25.940]   Yeah.
[00:44:25.940 --> 00:44:28.700]   As I said on all about Android, that's marketing 201.
[00:44:28.700 --> 00:44:32.820]   Is that a better strategy than Apple strategy which is to keep a secret?
[00:44:32.820 --> 00:44:33.820]   I think so.
[00:44:33.820 --> 00:44:34.820]   Just go ahead and embrace it.
[00:44:34.820 --> 00:44:36.420]   Especially if you can't stop the leaks.
[00:44:36.420 --> 00:44:37.420]   Right.
[00:44:37.420 --> 00:44:38.420]   Just go ahead and embrace it.
[00:44:38.420 --> 00:44:39.420]   So Apple tries, but fails.
[00:44:39.420 --> 00:44:45.420]   You know, if they put a point in Mark Gurman, they'd be fine, but that guy is good.
[00:44:45.420 --> 00:44:50.940]   It pulls a lot of energy just trying to stop it and get stuff taken down.
[00:44:50.940 --> 00:44:52.620]   Why burn all those calories?
[00:44:52.620 --> 00:44:53.620]   Just roll with it.
[00:44:53.620 --> 00:44:54.620]   And don't you think...
[00:44:54.620 --> 00:44:55.620]   Sorry.
[00:44:55.620 --> 00:44:59.700]   And don't you think that part of this is that these days after all the secrecy with Apple,
[00:44:59.700 --> 00:45:01.700]   people end up being disappointed in the announcement?
[00:45:01.700 --> 00:45:02.700]   Yeah.
[00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:03.700]   This is true.
[00:45:03.700 --> 00:45:04.700]   But it's a letdown.
[00:45:04.700 --> 00:45:05.700]   So now with Google, there's no letdown.
[00:45:05.700 --> 00:45:06.700]   You know what it is.
[00:45:06.700 --> 00:45:08.500]   You actually get to see it.
[00:45:08.500 --> 00:45:13.820]   To me, if you had something really major like a spectacular new Pixelbook, you might want
[00:45:13.820 --> 00:45:14.940]   to keep that really secret.
[00:45:14.940 --> 00:45:19.740]   I would like to have a little bit of an excitement when these events come around.
[00:45:19.740 --> 00:45:20.740]   But I get it.
[00:45:20.740 --> 00:45:23.580]   It keeps all of the disappointment at bay, allegedly.
[00:45:23.580 --> 00:45:24.580]   Yeah.
[00:45:24.580 --> 00:45:25.580]   Yeah.
[00:45:25.580 --> 00:45:26.580]   This was...
[00:45:26.580 --> 00:45:27.580]   I think these events are silly now.
[00:45:27.580 --> 00:45:32.780]   I was reflecting about this because Apple with their event, they've got all this pressure
[00:45:32.780 --> 00:45:37.780]   to create this big bang-buds kind of thing.
[00:45:37.780 --> 00:45:39.940]   And right now we're just...
[00:45:39.940 --> 00:45:40.940]   We're not at a phase.
[00:45:40.940 --> 00:45:47.180]   It feels like you know when you're a kid and you stop believing in Santa Claus and Christmas
[00:45:47.180 --> 00:45:49.420]   is maybe you don't have anything awesome coming.
[00:45:49.420 --> 00:45:50.420]   Don't tell me.
[00:45:50.420 --> 00:45:51.420]   Really?
[00:45:51.420 --> 00:45:52.420]   I believe in Santa Claus.
[00:45:52.420 --> 00:45:55.020]   By the way, I just want to point out if you don't believe in Santa Claus, he doesn't
[00:45:55.020 --> 00:45:56.020]   bring you gifts.
[00:45:56.020 --> 00:45:57.020]   Oh, that's my problem.
[00:45:57.020 --> 00:45:59.020]   But if it isn't, you don't hear it.
[00:45:59.020 --> 00:46:01.500]   It's like you just go through the motions.
[00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:02.500]   And I feel like...
[00:46:02.500 --> 00:46:07.140]   Wasn't that what Corey Lewandowski said in his testimony in front of Congress?
[00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:08.140]   He said...
[00:46:08.140 --> 00:46:11.700]   Because the guy said, "I don't believe this anymore and I believe the tooth fairy."
[00:46:11.700 --> 00:46:13.580]   And Corey said, "My kids are watching."
[00:46:13.580 --> 00:46:14.580]   Oh man.
[00:46:14.580 --> 00:46:15.580]   Corey.
[00:46:15.580 --> 00:46:18.500]   Oh, well, that's the least of their problems.
[00:46:18.500 --> 00:46:19.500]   Corey!
[00:46:19.500 --> 00:46:20.500]   Stacey, so...
[00:46:20.500 --> 00:46:24.180]   Stacey, you're channeling Charlie Wartzell, who is a tech writer for The New York Times,
[00:46:24.180 --> 00:46:29.980]   now also opinion writer, who just a couple of days ago published this opinion piece,
[00:46:29.980 --> 00:46:32.780]   The Last Apple keynote, Let's Hope.
[00:46:32.780 --> 00:46:33.780]   Oh, I didn't see that.
[00:46:33.780 --> 00:46:37.460]   The company's product launch pageant has become a parody.
[00:46:37.460 --> 00:46:39.460]   Time to call it quits.
[00:46:39.460 --> 00:46:46.340]   Well, I haven't read this, but does he go into the fact that we may just be a point of not
[00:46:46.340 --> 00:46:49.300]   necessarily stagnation, but innovation stagnation?
[00:46:49.300 --> 00:46:52.580]   You know, there's only so much we can do with these phones now.
[00:46:52.580 --> 00:46:53.580]   Exactly.
[00:46:53.580 --> 00:46:54.580]   You know, it's...
[00:46:54.580 --> 00:46:57.260]   Well, there's other devices that they're launching.
[00:46:57.260 --> 00:47:01.780]   He says, "What started as a Steve Jobs TED Talk has become a parody.
[00:47:01.780 --> 00:47:06.660]   This is his chief point, a decadent pageant of Palo Alto executives closed and they're
[00:47:06.660 --> 00:47:13.060]   posed in their finest dad casual, reading ad copy as lead in for vaguely sexual jump
[00:47:13.060 --> 00:47:16.780]   cut videos of brushed aluminum under nightclub lighting.
[00:47:16.780 --> 00:47:17.780]   The events...
[00:47:17.780 --> 00:47:18.780]   I love it.
[00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:24.500]   The events are exhausting love letters to consumerism, complete with rounds of applause
[00:47:24.500 --> 00:47:29.220]   from the laptop lit faces of the tech blogging audience when executives mention that you,
[00:47:29.220 --> 00:47:34.660]   yes, you can hold the future in your hands for just 24.95 a month or 5.99 with trade-in.
[00:47:34.660 --> 00:47:36.500]   The tech bloggers are not the ones applauding.
[00:47:36.500 --> 00:47:40.020]   Yes, John Groover was quick to point out that that's not his applauding.
[00:47:40.020 --> 00:47:41.500]   That's the staff, right?
[00:47:41.500 --> 00:47:42.500]   Yeah, there's...
[00:47:42.500 --> 00:47:45.220]   Groover said it really isn't a press event very much.
[00:47:45.220 --> 00:47:47.740]   At Steve Jobs Theatre doesn't have a lot of room, so it's not a lot of press.
[00:47:47.740 --> 00:47:51.300]   It's mostly Apple employees who are...
[00:47:51.300 --> 00:47:52.740]   And certainly those are the ones cheering.
[00:47:52.740 --> 00:47:55.580]   At least I hope so.
[00:47:55.580 --> 00:48:00.860]   Here's Matt Hoban's tweet, "Apple serving gilded desserts at today's event sure does
[00:48:00.860 --> 00:48:03.380]   seem symbolic of something."
[00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:08.060]   That is a gilded macahole.
[00:48:08.060 --> 00:48:09.060]   And a lemon bar is settled.
[00:48:09.060 --> 00:48:10.060]   Yeah, it looks like a delicious...
[00:48:10.060 --> 00:48:15.220]   I have to say, I haven't been to an Apple event since 2010.
[00:48:15.220 --> 00:48:17.300]   Stacey's reverse engineering the desserts are like...
[00:48:17.300 --> 00:48:20.900]   But they've really upgraded the stale muffins they served back in the day.
[00:48:20.900 --> 00:48:21.900]   It's like green stuff.
[00:48:21.900 --> 00:48:22.900]   Wait, wait, wait, go back down.
[00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:23.900]   What's the...
[00:48:23.900 --> 00:48:25.700]   Oh, looks like some green thing.
[00:48:25.700 --> 00:48:26.700]   And butcher's toilet.
[00:48:26.700 --> 00:48:28.660]   No, no, it's just green.
[00:48:28.660 --> 00:48:33.340]   But honestly, these are much fancier than they used to do.
[00:48:33.340 --> 00:48:34.340]   Superfood.
[00:48:34.340 --> 00:48:37.020]   Yeah, superfood.
[00:48:37.020 --> 00:48:41.980]   I appreciate Apple putting their effort in to try to give it a little bit of pizzazz
[00:48:41.980 --> 00:48:45.300]   and some showmanship and marketing, if you will.
[00:48:45.300 --> 00:48:50.740]   But at the end of the day, it's still pretty hard to sexy up a phone because they're all
[00:48:50.740 --> 00:48:55.460]   doing pretty much the same thing where there's an Apple phone, Google phone, Huawei.
[00:48:55.460 --> 00:48:56.900]   Everybody's pretty much doing the same thing.
[00:48:56.900 --> 00:49:00.300]   Young man, I'm old enough to remember when people would sleep out in line today.
[00:49:00.300 --> 00:49:01.300]   I remember that too.
[00:49:01.300 --> 00:49:06.740]   I remember that too and I thought they were nuts.
[00:49:06.740 --> 00:49:08.940]   So, Gruber pointed out...
[00:49:08.940 --> 00:49:11.380]   Hey, the boss, you just called the boss nuts.
[00:49:11.380 --> 00:49:12.380]   Okay.
[00:49:12.380 --> 00:49:18.780]   Gruber pointed out, first time, on daring fireball, that he would not want to be the...
[00:49:18.780 --> 00:49:21.580]   And Kim Cookshoes, when he goes to the board and says, "Oh, by the way, guys, we're not
[00:49:21.580 --> 00:49:24.540]   going to be doing these events anymore."
[00:49:24.540 --> 00:49:25.860]   He says, "Look at the...
[00:49:25.860 --> 00:49:29.540]   We don't get numbers from Apple about how many people watch the events, but look at
[00:49:29.540 --> 00:49:31.860]   the YouTube, they, for the first time, they put it on YouTube.
[00:49:31.860 --> 00:49:38.260]   4.2 million views of this event since September 10th on YouTube.
[00:49:38.260 --> 00:49:41.300]   Apple has 10 million YouTube subscribers.
[00:49:41.300 --> 00:49:42.780]   This is not for the press anymore.
[00:49:42.780 --> 00:49:44.060]   This is for the public.
[00:49:44.060 --> 00:49:45.620]   This is for Apple fans.
[00:49:45.620 --> 00:49:46.780]   And it works.
[00:49:46.780 --> 00:49:47.780]   It sells phones.
[00:49:47.780 --> 00:49:48.780]   They're going to keep selling.
[00:49:48.780 --> 00:49:53.700]   But as the public, I mean, we're going to keep going because you get the most page views
[00:49:53.700 --> 00:49:55.020]   when you do Apple stuff.
[00:49:55.020 --> 00:49:56.020]   But honestly, it's...
[00:49:56.020 --> 00:49:58.980]   Hey, I'm not doing this for page views.
[00:49:58.980 --> 00:49:59.980]   What are you saying?
[00:49:59.980 --> 00:50:00.980]   I'm just saying that's why.
[00:50:00.980 --> 00:50:01.980]   What do you think?
[00:50:01.980 --> 00:50:02.980]   This is a podcast network.
[00:50:02.980 --> 00:50:05.460]   Honestly, I'm not doing it because of...
[00:50:05.460 --> 00:50:06.900]   This was my job.
[00:50:06.900 --> 00:50:08.820]   We used to have to track all this.
[00:50:08.820 --> 00:50:12.660]   And this is where, I mean, September was always the biggest month.
[00:50:12.660 --> 00:50:13.660]   I'm sorry, Leo.
[00:50:13.660 --> 00:50:17.780]   You think that we do this for the page views.
[00:50:17.780 --> 00:50:19.820]   I do it because I care.
[00:50:19.820 --> 00:50:21.420]   I do it because it's a good topic.
[00:50:21.420 --> 00:50:22.420]   About the page views.
[00:50:22.420 --> 00:50:23.420]   No!
[00:50:23.420 --> 00:50:25.420]   I mean, I used to...
[00:50:25.420 --> 00:50:30.460]   I have never done anything to increase the audience in this show.
[00:50:30.460 --> 00:50:32.460]   I think everybody will agree.
[00:50:32.460 --> 00:50:33.460]   No comment.
[00:50:33.460 --> 00:50:36.220]   Our marketing staff would agree with that state.
[00:50:36.220 --> 00:50:37.740]   That's their job, not mine.
[00:50:37.740 --> 00:50:39.740]   I'm here to give you great content.
[00:50:39.740 --> 00:50:43.620]   And I believe great content will be all I'll have to do.
[00:50:43.620 --> 00:50:44.620]   Definitely.
[00:50:44.620 --> 00:50:47.820]   Everybody's laughing at me now.
[00:50:47.820 --> 00:50:48.820]   Lisa's in here going.
[00:50:48.820 --> 00:50:49.820]   Yeah, right.
[00:50:49.820 --> 00:50:52.420]   That's what I do.
[00:50:52.420 --> 00:51:00.900]   The NLRB has ordered Google to let employees speak out on political and workplace issues.
[00:51:00.900 --> 00:51:05.300]   This is a settlement that were complaints that Google was restraining free speech.
[00:51:05.300 --> 00:51:09.460]   In fact, remember when Google said, "We're not going to allow any more political speech
[00:51:09.460 --> 00:51:12.380]   on our internal bulletin boards."
[00:51:12.380 --> 00:51:14.500]   No, this is talking about...
[00:51:14.500 --> 00:51:15.500]   This is public.
[00:51:15.500 --> 00:51:16.500]   ... been talking to protests.
[00:51:16.500 --> 00:51:17.500]   The public.
[00:51:17.500 --> 00:51:18.500]   Yeah.
[00:51:18.500 --> 00:51:19.500]   Including about salaries.
[00:51:19.500 --> 00:51:20.500]   Oh.
[00:51:20.500 --> 00:51:22.500]   NLRB said you can talk about salaries.
[00:51:22.500 --> 00:51:23.500]   I can't imagine that.
[00:51:23.500 --> 00:51:24.500]   That's...
[00:51:24.500 --> 00:51:28.300]   So I think in these cases we've got to ask a few things.
[00:51:28.300 --> 00:51:33.020]   Number one, we've got to ask were the complainants purely political on one side of things?
[00:51:33.020 --> 00:51:37.380]   And was the process purely political or was this legitimate process?
[00:51:37.380 --> 00:51:38.660]   We're forced to ask this all the time.
[00:51:38.660 --> 00:51:41.620]   It's so sad that this is the state of the nation.
[00:51:41.620 --> 00:51:42.620]   Yeah.
[00:51:42.620 --> 00:51:43.860]   It could be legitimate.
[00:51:43.860 --> 00:51:48.020]   It could be one wing versus the other.
[00:51:48.020 --> 00:51:51.020]   It says, "You're being mean to us.
[00:51:51.020 --> 00:51:52.020]   You can't talk."
[00:51:52.020 --> 00:51:53.020]   I find it odd to say...
[00:51:53.020 --> 00:51:57.460]   Listen, just say that you can talk publicly about how your employer does bad things.
[00:51:57.460 --> 00:51:58.620]   Yes.
[00:51:58.620 --> 00:52:05.500]   But beyond that, to force the ability to do political speech in the company outside the
[00:52:05.500 --> 00:52:06.500]   company, sure.
[00:52:06.500 --> 00:52:07.500]   Inside...
[00:52:07.500 --> 00:52:13.140]   I need to reveal salaries.
[00:52:13.140 --> 00:52:14.980]   So I don't know how to read this one.
[00:52:14.980 --> 00:52:15.980]   Hmm.
[00:52:15.980 --> 00:52:18.580]   I should be able to tell people my salary if I want to.
[00:52:18.580 --> 00:52:19.580]   Yeah.
[00:52:19.580 --> 00:52:22.580]   This is a historic tension between employees and employers.
[00:52:22.580 --> 00:52:26.340]   Employers, of course, want employees to be in the dark about what the other employers
[00:52:26.340 --> 00:52:27.340]   are making.
[00:52:27.340 --> 00:52:28.340]   Right.
[00:52:28.340 --> 00:52:29.340]   It gives us...
[00:52:29.340 --> 00:52:31.340]   Well, there's two arguments.
[00:52:31.340 --> 00:52:32.900]   One is it just breeds discontent.
[00:52:32.900 --> 00:52:36.380]   But the other argument, which is probably the more realistic argument, is we don't want
[00:52:36.380 --> 00:52:37.380]   you negotiating.
[00:52:37.380 --> 00:52:38.380]   Right.
[00:52:38.380 --> 00:52:39.380]   Based on someone else.
[00:52:39.380 --> 00:52:40.380]   Based on someone else.
[00:52:40.380 --> 00:52:41.380]   We don't...
[00:52:41.380 --> 00:52:45.260]   I don't want Ant coming to me saying, "You're paying Michael what?"
[00:52:45.260 --> 00:52:48.620]   No, it's best if nobody knows that.
[00:52:48.620 --> 00:52:51.540]   On the other hand, employees, it absolutely is important.
[00:52:51.540 --> 00:52:52.540]   It's very valuable.
[00:52:52.540 --> 00:52:56.300]   That's why there's websites where you can go and see what the typical salaries are for
[00:52:56.300 --> 00:53:03.300]   people because it gives you power to negotiate.
[00:53:03.300 --> 00:53:09.100]   So I have to wear two hats because I am both an employer and an employee.
[00:53:09.100 --> 00:53:12.420]   And I would like to tell you how much I make, but I actually don't know.
[00:53:12.420 --> 00:53:13.420]   No idea.
[00:53:13.420 --> 00:53:17.260]   Lisa, Lisa lets you know at the end of every month or the end of every year.
[00:53:17.260 --> 00:53:20.140]   No, I'm not allowed to tell myself how much I make.
[00:53:20.140 --> 00:53:22.100]   It's against the rules.
[00:53:22.100 --> 00:53:25.140]   So no, actually I really don't.
[00:53:25.140 --> 00:53:27.940]   He's the only person he doesn't make enough to get what he wants.
[00:53:27.940 --> 00:53:34.140]   Well, the problem is, okay, so nobody cares about this, but this is an LLC.
[00:53:34.140 --> 00:53:36.020]   So it's Pastor Taxation.
[00:53:36.020 --> 00:53:41.820]   So basically, my tax or architecture, because Lisa and I file, apparently, is what we make.
[00:53:41.820 --> 00:53:42.820]   But it's really...
[00:53:42.820 --> 00:53:45.700]   It's like a bigger entity.
[00:53:45.700 --> 00:53:50.340]   And I definitely know I don't get whatever that is because I am definitely not getting
[00:53:50.340 --> 00:53:51.580]   all that money.
[00:53:51.580 --> 00:53:54.140]   I think somebody else's, but I don't know.
[00:53:54.140 --> 00:53:55.940]   I appreciate you having me.
[00:53:55.940 --> 00:53:56.940]   Yeah, thank you.
[00:53:56.940 --> 00:53:57.940]   I hope you're happy.
[00:53:57.940 --> 00:54:01.500]   Hey, we had to get him to move out here for more stuff.
[00:54:01.500 --> 00:54:02.500]   Googleness.
[00:54:02.500 --> 00:54:04.500]   You're getting paid in Outback Steakhouse gift certificates, right?
[00:54:04.500 --> 00:54:05.500]   Yes.
[00:54:05.500 --> 00:54:07.940]   That's what I'm getting paid in.
[00:54:07.940 --> 00:54:10.540]   All the queso you can eat, Stacey.
[00:54:10.540 --> 00:54:11.820]   All the blue mint onions on it.
[00:54:11.820 --> 00:54:14.260]   All the blue mint onions everywhere.
[00:54:14.260 --> 00:54:19.180]   Google is apparently, according to 9.5 Google, planning a new Wi-Fi hub.
[00:54:19.180 --> 00:54:20.820]   It won't look like the old one.
[00:54:20.820 --> 00:54:22.500]   This is an artist's rendering.
[00:54:22.500 --> 00:54:25.860]   The old Wi-Fi with a Google Home system top.
[00:54:25.860 --> 00:54:27.860]   It will not look like that either.
[00:54:27.860 --> 00:54:28.860]   Don't get excited.
[00:54:28.860 --> 00:54:29.860]   Let's well lit.
[00:54:29.860 --> 00:54:30.860]   Dad is clever.
[00:54:30.860 --> 00:54:32.860]   Doing a mockup right now.
[00:54:32.860 --> 00:54:33.860]   He's clever.
[00:54:33.860 --> 00:54:34.860]   You just do the duct tape.
[00:54:34.860 --> 00:54:36.180]   So Kevin broke this story.
[00:54:36.180 --> 00:54:40.700]   I just have to give Frost and Kevin all the way back in April.
[00:54:40.700 --> 00:54:49.780]   Because he found the chip in the language in Chromium for Mistral and then did all this
[00:54:49.780 --> 00:54:51.860]   other stuff related to it.
[00:54:51.860 --> 00:54:54.340]   I just want to give a big shout out to Kevin Tofol.
[00:54:54.340 --> 00:54:55.340]   Absolutely.
[00:54:55.340 --> 00:54:56.340]   Again, he'll be on next week.
[00:54:56.340 --> 00:54:58.340]   We'll be talking about this.
[00:54:58.340 --> 00:54:59.340]   That's awesome.
[00:54:59.340 --> 00:55:03.260]   The 9.5 Google post says, according to sources familiar with the matter, Google will announce
[00:55:03.260 --> 00:55:07.260]   this new router at the event on October 15th.
[00:55:07.260 --> 00:55:10.940]   The Nest Wi-Fi, everything's going to be Nest now.
[00:55:10.940 --> 00:55:12.740]   Are there home products that are now in StS?
[00:55:12.740 --> 00:55:20.020]   Nest Wi-Fi router will be accompanied by little beacons that double as assistant speakers.
[00:55:20.020 --> 00:55:21.020]   That's nice.
[00:55:21.020 --> 00:55:22.020]   You can assist in everywhere.
[00:55:22.020 --> 00:55:23.020]   That's pretty cool.
[00:55:23.020 --> 00:55:24.020]   I'll be listening everywhere.
[00:55:24.020 --> 00:55:25.020]   Did you watch?
[00:55:25.020 --> 00:55:26.020]   No cameras, all right.
[00:55:26.020 --> 00:55:28.580]   Did you watch Succession on Sunday?
[00:55:28.580 --> 00:55:35.220]   So Tom, who is just complete mess up.
[00:55:35.220 --> 00:55:38.780]   It has a new slogan for the News Network, ATM.
[00:55:38.780 --> 00:55:40.500]   We're listening.
[00:55:40.500 --> 00:55:42.900]   His assistant, cousin Greg, oh, I'm sorry.
[00:55:42.900 --> 00:55:43.900]   He wants to call it Gregory now.
[00:55:43.900 --> 00:55:47.380]   Cousin Gregory comes up and says, we can't use that.
[00:55:47.380 --> 00:55:48.380]   Tom says, why?
[00:55:48.380 --> 00:55:50.380]   Well, because we actually are listening.
[00:55:50.380 --> 00:55:51.380]   Oh, man.
[00:55:51.380 --> 00:55:56.940]   It turns out the set top boxes we've sent everybody have microphones.
[00:55:56.940 --> 00:55:59.380]   It's fairly aggressively listening.
[00:55:59.380 --> 00:56:00.940]   How dare.
[00:56:00.940 --> 00:56:07.540]   So then, well, what about we hear you?
[00:56:07.540 --> 00:56:08.900]   No, that's the same thing.
[00:56:08.900 --> 00:56:12.380]   So they have not two episodes.
[00:56:12.380 --> 00:56:13.380]   Oh, sorry.
[00:56:13.380 --> 00:56:14.380]   You're going to laugh.
[00:56:14.380 --> 00:56:19.340]   They end up with the slogan, we hear for you.
[00:56:19.340 --> 00:56:26.300]   It is actually comedic.
[00:56:26.300 --> 00:56:28.860]   It's the most comedic event.
[00:56:28.860 --> 00:56:29.860]   What is this show?
[00:56:29.860 --> 00:56:30.860]   Succession.
[00:56:30.860 --> 00:56:31.860]   It's amazing.
[00:56:31.860 --> 00:56:32.860]   HBO?
[00:56:32.860 --> 00:56:33.860]   HBO is so good.
[00:56:33.860 --> 00:56:34.860]   I need to.
[00:56:34.860 --> 00:56:35.860]   Did they get a little?
[00:56:35.860 --> 00:56:36.860]   Did they get the?
[00:56:36.860 --> 00:56:40.020]   I saw a lot of comment going on about the Alan Summer Camp.
[00:56:40.020 --> 00:56:41.020]   There's our Jesties.
[00:56:41.020 --> 00:56:43.020]   They called it our Jesties.
[00:56:43.020 --> 00:56:48.860]   It is absolutely nailed right down to the, what was it?
[00:56:48.860 --> 00:56:51.060]   Oh, God.
[00:56:51.060 --> 00:56:54.060]   I can't remember the exact name.
[00:56:54.060 --> 00:56:57.060]   What's the European airline?
[00:56:57.060 --> 00:57:01.860]   The Airbus Eco Walk lecture.
[00:57:01.860 --> 00:57:02.860]   What?
[00:57:02.860 --> 00:57:15.140]   They walk over a bridge in Panchos while they're talking about their commitment to sustainable
[00:57:15.140 --> 00:57:17.260]   something around.
[00:57:17.260 --> 00:57:18.260]   You're going to love it.
[00:57:18.260 --> 00:57:20.180]   Jeff, have you been an Alan and co?
[00:57:20.180 --> 00:57:21.180]   No.
[00:57:21.180 --> 00:57:22.180]   Okay.
[00:57:22.180 --> 00:57:23.180]   But you've been a Davos.
[00:57:23.180 --> 00:57:24.180]   You've been enough things like it.
[00:57:24.180 --> 00:57:25.620]   There were a lot of Davos jokes.
[00:57:25.620 --> 00:57:27.820]   You'll probably recognize it.
[00:57:27.820 --> 00:57:30.020]   Oh, it's the best show on TV.
[00:57:30.020 --> 00:57:31.020]   So good now.
[00:57:31.020 --> 00:57:35.780]   In fact, if you're too behind, the show, the episode you're about to see next is absolutely
[00:57:35.780 --> 00:57:37.980]   one of the best shows I've ever seen.
[00:57:37.980 --> 00:57:38.980]   Wow.
[00:57:38.980 --> 00:57:39.980]   So good.
[00:57:39.980 --> 00:57:40.980]   All right.
[00:57:40.980 --> 00:57:41.980]   I don't know.
[00:57:41.980 --> 00:57:42.980]   I got off track.
[00:57:42.980 --> 00:57:44.620]   The assistant.
[00:57:44.620 --> 00:57:45.620]   We hear you.
[00:57:45.620 --> 00:57:46.620]   Router.
[00:57:46.620 --> 00:57:47.620]   We're listening.
[00:57:47.620 --> 00:57:53.540]   So now you'll have devices with microphones in every room of the home.
[00:57:53.540 --> 00:57:57.580]   You say Google's adopting an Eero-like package with the next Wi-Fi.
[00:57:57.580 --> 00:57:58.580]   Really?
[00:57:58.580 --> 00:58:01.380]   But that was always the pitch of the Google Wi-Fi was that it was mesh, right?
[00:58:01.380 --> 00:58:02.380]   Right.
[00:58:02.380 --> 00:58:04.620]   It's the assistant that's the cool new part.
[00:58:04.620 --> 00:58:05.620]   You're adding the assistant.
[00:58:05.620 --> 00:58:06.620]   Yes, it was always.
[00:58:06.620 --> 00:58:07.620]   Yes.
[00:58:07.620 --> 00:58:12.260]   The smaller devices will double as assistant speakers as well as microphones while the
[00:58:12.260 --> 00:58:13.900]   main router will not.
[00:58:13.900 --> 00:58:14.900]   Oh.
[00:58:14.900 --> 00:58:15.900]   Which is odd.
[00:58:15.900 --> 00:58:17.700]   I'd like to see that in action.
[00:58:17.700 --> 00:58:19.260]   Yeah.
[00:58:19.260 --> 00:58:23.460]   And you'll be able to use it with your old Google Wi-Fi hardware.
[00:58:23.460 --> 00:58:26.140]   So if you have existing hardware, it'll still work.
[00:58:26.140 --> 00:58:27.140]   But it's not 6.
[00:58:27.140 --> 00:58:29.140]   But not Wi-Fi 6.
[00:58:29.140 --> 00:58:30.140]   Ooh.
[00:58:30.140 --> 00:58:31.140]   Wi-Fi 6.
[00:58:31.140 --> 00:58:36.620]   I use Eros, of course.
[00:58:36.620 --> 00:58:38.420]   I think they'll probably have to do hardware, right?
[00:58:38.420 --> 00:58:40.140]   Stacey, you can't do a software upgrade.
[00:58:40.140 --> 00:58:41.420]   So I have to do a hardware upgrade.
[00:58:41.420 --> 00:58:42.420]   Yeah.
[00:58:42.420 --> 00:58:43.780]   This will need new hardware.
[00:58:43.780 --> 00:58:44.780]   They're a sponsor.
[00:58:44.780 --> 00:58:46.340]   But I also use Netgear's Orbeez.
[00:58:46.340 --> 00:58:49.140]   And they've already announced Wi-Fi 6 Orbeez.
[00:58:49.140 --> 00:58:52.940]   So I'm telling you, you don't need no one.
[00:58:52.940 --> 00:58:53.940]   I don't need it.
[00:58:53.940 --> 00:58:54.940]   No.
[00:58:54.940 --> 00:58:56.700]   Don't run out and buy a new router for this.
[00:58:56.700 --> 00:58:58.140]   Unless you're buying a router.
[00:58:58.140 --> 00:58:59.420]   If you're buying a router, look for it.
[00:58:59.420 --> 00:59:01.340]   They have 60 devices plus.
[00:59:01.340 --> 00:59:02.340]   Stacey said so.
[00:59:02.340 --> 00:59:03.340]   Okay.
[00:59:03.340 --> 00:59:05.580]   But dude, they're not going to work.
[00:59:05.580 --> 00:59:08.740]   You're going to have to get all new devices that are Wi-Fi 6.
[00:59:08.740 --> 00:59:09.740]   Oh, that's right.
[00:59:09.740 --> 00:59:10.740]   They have to be Wi-Fi 6.
[00:59:10.740 --> 00:59:11.740]   Stacey, Stacey, Stacey, Stacey.
[00:59:11.740 --> 00:59:13.740]   That just gives them the excuse to buy all those new devices.
[00:59:13.740 --> 00:59:14.740]   I can buy new devices.
[00:59:14.740 --> 00:59:15.740]   They're not out yet.
[00:59:15.740 --> 00:59:16.740]   You've got to get into Leo's head here.
[00:59:16.740 --> 00:59:17.740]   I can buy new devices.
[00:59:17.740 --> 00:59:19.740]   Can you say, buy new devices?
[00:59:19.740 --> 00:59:20.740]   Plan to see.
[00:59:20.740 --> 00:59:21.740]   Stacey told me.
[00:59:21.740 --> 00:59:22.740]   Wait, don't tell Lisa any of this.
[00:59:22.740 --> 00:59:25.940]   Lisa, I didn't say that he should buy new devices.
[00:59:25.940 --> 00:59:29.140]   No, I'm not buying new devices.
[00:59:29.140 --> 00:59:34.460]   Google has published a paper on the Google AI blog about using deep learning to inform
[00:59:34.460 --> 00:59:39.700]   differential diagnoses of skin diseases.
[00:59:39.700 --> 00:59:42.860]   This is AI slowly marching into medicine.
[00:59:42.860 --> 00:59:49.020]   We've seen in the past that AI did a pretty good job interpreting x-rays, doing the job
[00:59:49.020 --> 00:59:52.540]   of a radiologist.
[00:59:52.540 --> 01:00:02.420]   General practitioners, when shown images of skin conditions, are between 24 and 70% accurate.
[01:00:02.420 --> 01:00:04.300]   You're GP.
[01:00:04.300 --> 01:00:06.020]   If you're a dermatologist, it's much better.
[01:00:06.020 --> 01:00:08.740]   77 and 96% accurate.
[01:00:08.740 --> 01:00:15.780]   But a lot of people can't get to a dermatologist or they don't have the access to a dermatologist.
[01:00:15.780 --> 01:00:17.340]   So that's why there's this interest.
[01:00:17.340 --> 01:00:19.500]   It's not that dermatologists don't do a very good job.
[01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:21.940]   They know what they're looking at.
[01:00:21.940 --> 01:00:24.440]   But it would help.
[01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:27.620]   It would take me six to eight weeks to get into a dermatologist.
[01:00:27.620 --> 01:00:30.380]   So if I thought I had some sort of cancerous lesion.
[01:00:30.380 --> 01:00:31.380]   There you go.
[01:00:31.380 --> 01:00:32.380]   Yeah.
[01:00:32.380 --> 01:00:35.740]   I mean, I guess then it might be like, yes, this is 75% likely to be melanoma.
[01:00:35.740 --> 01:00:37.460]   Then I'd be like, oh.
[01:00:37.460 --> 01:00:40.660]   Well, how soon before you said app?
[01:00:40.660 --> 01:00:43.220]   You know, cancer app, it should be.
[01:00:43.220 --> 01:00:44.220]   So okay.
[01:00:44.220 --> 01:00:45.980]   So that's an interesting question.
[01:00:45.980 --> 01:00:48.180]   Should it be because of this?
[01:00:48.180 --> 01:00:52.580]   Like, again, if we don't have the medical infrastructure to help me out, I see this that
[01:00:52.580 --> 01:00:54.100]   I go to my doctor.
[01:00:54.100 --> 01:00:55.740]   My doctor doesn't know how credible it is.
[01:00:55.740 --> 01:00:58.620]   This is going to be FDA approved.
[01:00:58.620 --> 01:00:59.620]   I don't know.
[01:00:59.620 --> 01:01:00.620]   And the FDA.
[01:01:00.620 --> 01:01:01.620]   So why have my cardiac?
[01:01:01.620 --> 01:01:04.620]   Well, yeah, my cardiac.
[01:01:04.620 --> 01:01:05.620]   That has been approved.
[01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:06.620]   It has been approved.
[01:01:06.620 --> 01:01:08.620]   It has been approved.
[01:01:08.620 --> 01:01:11.820]   And it doesn't just do a good EKG.
[01:01:11.820 --> 01:01:13.260]   It reads the AKG.
[01:01:13.260 --> 01:01:14.260]   Right.
[01:01:14.260 --> 01:01:17.340]   And it's a very reliable way because of machine learning.
[01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:18.860]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:01:18.860 --> 01:01:21.620]   This is the a live core product.
[01:01:21.620 --> 01:01:24.580]   It's 99 bucks works with a smartphone.
[01:01:24.580 --> 01:01:26.220]   Did you get the new cardio?
[01:01:26.220 --> 01:01:27.220]   K-A-R-D-I-A.
[01:01:27.220 --> 01:01:28.220]   Is there a new cardio?
[01:01:28.220 --> 01:01:29.220]   I think there is.
[01:01:29.220 --> 01:01:31.220]   There is, yeah.
[01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:32.220]   A live core.
[01:01:32.220 --> 01:01:34.220]   This is actually this better to me.
[01:01:34.220 --> 01:01:35.220]   Yeah.
[01:01:35.220 --> 01:01:37.060]   I think it's a isn't it a watch?
[01:01:37.060 --> 01:01:42.500]   Let me go to their website and see a live core dot.
[01:01:42.500 --> 01:01:43.500]   I don't see any.
[01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:44.500]   Oh, there it is.
[01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:45.800]   Cardiac 6L.
[01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:46.800]   Have you had occasion?
[01:01:46.800 --> 01:01:47.800]   Oh, yeah.
[01:01:47.800 --> 01:01:49.300]   There's more diodes.
[01:01:49.300 --> 01:01:50.300]   Oh, yeah.
[01:01:50.300 --> 01:01:51.900]   There it is.
[01:01:51.900 --> 01:01:55.380]   Six views of the heart, six times the data.
[01:01:55.380 --> 01:01:56.380]   That's cool.
[01:01:56.380 --> 01:01:57.380]   Oh.
[01:01:57.380 --> 01:01:58.380]   It's a six-lead EKG.
[01:01:58.380 --> 01:02:01.740]   So this was, of course, the original cardio was two leads.
[01:02:01.740 --> 01:02:02.820]   Two thumbs.
[01:02:02.820 --> 01:02:04.380]   The Apple Watch is two leads.
[01:02:04.380 --> 01:02:08.060]   You put your one finger, your finger on the stem and then it reads your wrist.
[01:02:08.060 --> 01:02:12.740]   A traditional EKG is 12 leads and of course much more accurate as a result.
[01:02:12.740 --> 01:02:13.940]   This is a six-lead though.
[01:02:13.940 --> 01:02:14.940]   That's pretty good.
[01:02:14.940 --> 01:02:17.940]   How does it, how does it do six leads from just two fingers?
[01:02:17.940 --> 01:02:20.340]   I don't know.
[01:02:20.340 --> 01:02:21.340]   Science.
[01:02:21.340 --> 01:02:22.340]   AI.
[01:02:22.340 --> 01:02:23.340]   You have all the answers.
[01:02:23.340 --> 01:02:24.340]   I don't know.
[01:02:24.340 --> 01:02:27.220]   It's got two sensors on top and now a third on the bottom.
[01:02:27.220 --> 01:02:30.180]   So you put it on your thigh.
[01:02:30.180 --> 01:02:31.620]   So your left leg.
[01:02:31.620 --> 01:02:33.940]   Oh, well, I got to pull my pants up.
[01:02:33.940 --> 01:02:35.380]   We're going to start wearing a skirt.
[01:02:35.380 --> 01:02:36.380]   Wear skirts.
[01:02:36.380 --> 01:02:37.380]   Larger muscles.
[01:02:37.380 --> 01:02:38.380]   Actually, it's an excuse to wear shorts.
[01:02:38.380 --> 01:02:39.380]   In fact, yeah.
[01:02:39.380 --> 01:02:40.380]   Can you do it?
[01:02:40.380 --> 01:02:41.380]   I don't want to see shorts.
[01:02:41.380 --> 01:02:43.700]   I don't want to see me in shorts.
[01:02:43.700 --> 01:02:47.180]   My thighs have not seen sunlights since 1976.
[01:02:47.180 --> 01:02:48.180]   You don't want to see me in shorts.
[01:02:48.180 --> 01:02:50.860]   Oh, you're probably a Fitzpatrick type one.
[01:02:50.860 --> 01:02:52.500]   What's that?
[01:02:52.500 --> 01:02:53.820]   Well, I was reading on this.
[01:02:53.820 --> 01:02:57.820]   It turns out this is relevant to the Google AI skin thing.
[01:02:57.820 --> 01:03:01.140]   There are these Fitzpatrick types.
[01:03:01.140 --> 01:03:02.460]   There are six of them.
[01:03:02.460 --> 01:03:04.820]   Type one, pale white always burns never tans.
[01:03:04.820 --> 01:03:05.820]   Is that you?
[01:03:05.820 --> 01:03:08.180]   Oh, I burn.
[01:03:08.180 --> 01:03:09.180]   Yeah.
[01:03:09.180 --> 01:03:12.060]   Type six, darkest brown never burns.
[01:03:12.060 --> 01:03:16.540]   The best accuracy was achieved on two through four.
[01:03:16.540 --> 01:03:19.900]   So not quite as accurate on darker skins or yours.
[01:03:19.900 --> 01:03:20.900]   Right.
[01:03:20.900 --> 01:03:22.180]   Really pale skin.
[01:03:22.180 --> 01:03:30.420]   The accuracy was similar to actually even a little bit better than the general practitioner.
[01:03:30.420 --> 01:03:31.860]   69 to 72% accurate.
[01:03:31.860 --> 01:03:35.300]   The top three accuracy, 91 to 94% accurate.
[01:03:35.300 --> 01:03:36.660]   That's pretty strong.
[01:03:36.660 --> 01:03:37.660]   It's good enough.
[01:03:37.660 --> 01:03:39.580]   It gives you so many.
[01:03:39.580 --> 01:03:44.860]   I like that they had to parcel out, parcel partition out the data so they could say it's
[01:03:44.860 --> 01:03:46.340]   accurate on this type of skin.
[01:03:46.340 --> 01:03:47.340]   Isn't that interesting?
[01:03:47.340 --> 01:03:48.340]   Which really matters.
[01:03:48.340 --> 01:03:50.140]   This is what you should do with face recognition.
[01:03:50.140 --> 01:03:54.380]   It's really critical important with race as well and what the learning set is.
[01:03:54.380 --> 01:03:55.380]   Yes.
[01:03:55.380 --> 01:03:56.380]   Right.
[01:03:56.380 --> 01:04:02.380]   Well, so this gets to this FDA thing I was trying to talk about, which is as we start
[01:04:02.380 --> 01:04:08.620]   bringing in machine learning products into medical devices, which is important, we're
[01:04:08.620 --> 01:04:17.020]   going to need a process for when they retrain their algorithms for making sure that it's
[01:04:17.020 --> 01:04:20.300]   it works better than the other one, for example.
[01:04:20.300 --> 01:04:23.580]   So just like if you have a new formulation of the drug, you have to go through new testing
[01:04:23.580 --> 01:04:27.860]   things, the FDA is trying to figure out what's the process by which you should update your
[01:04:27.860 --> 01:04:30.380]   machine learning algorithms in a medical device.
[01:04:30.380 --> 01:04:35.820]   And I think it's really fascinating because they're talking about like how to do reproducibility,
[01:04:35.820 --> 01:04:43.420]   how to make sure your data sets are all encompassed, like a good sample size, I guess.
[01:04:43.420 --> 01:04:46.140]   It's a really tough problem.
[01:04:46.140 --> 01:04:47.140]   Yeah.
[01:04:47.140 --> 01:04:53.340]   Well, in standardized it and also do it in a way to make sure that the Fitzpatrick one,
[01:04:53.340 --> 01:04:58.060]   people also, you know, who this is not going to work for, for example.
[01:04:58.060 --> 01:05:03.940]   It's trying to not get bit of bias, but address it and make sure that people are aware of
[01:05:03.940 --> 01:05:06.660]   it and it's communicated.
[01:05:06.660 --> 01:05:11.180]   In his piece that we already mentioned, Ben Evans uses the now classic example with AI,
[01:05:11.180 --> 01:05:18.780]   that if you have a bunch of pictures with rulers on them next to the lesion, then at
[01:05:18.780 --> 01:05:24.820]   some point, if you don't do things right, your AI will identify skin with rulers as
[01:05:24.820 --> 01:05:25.820]   skin with cancer.
[01:05:25.820 --> 01:05:27.860]   All right.
[01:05:27.860 --> 01:05:29.780]   Excellent example.
[01:05:29.780 --> 01:05:32.140]   Every time I see a ruler, there's cancer.
[01:05:32.140 --> 01:05:33.140]   Cancer, right.
[01:05:33.140 --> 01:05:34.140]   Wow.
[01:05:34.140 --> 01:05:36.500]   That's how dumb these things are.
[01:05:36.500 --> 01:05:38.260]   Yeah.
[01:05:38.260 --> 01:05:43.540]   If you want to get the new Cartier mobile six L Jeff, it's 150 bucks.
[01:05:43.540 --> 01:05:44.540]   You get it.
[01:05:44.540 --> 01:05:46.460]   I'm going to get 100 points on the firing reasonable.
[01:05:46.460 --> 01:05:48.580]   And of course, you need a smartphone.
[01:05:48.580 --> 01:05:49.580]   This is a point.
[01:05:49.580 --> 01:05:50.580]   This is the.
[01:05:50.580 --> 01:05:51.580]   That's all really?
[01:05:51.580 --> 01:05:52.580]   Yeah, I know.
[01:05:52.580 --> 01:05:54.620]   The old one's a nine on for that tech.
[01:05:54.620 --> 01:05:59.780]   This is the magnifying factor.
[01:05:59.780 --> 01:06:06.940]   It's like, you know, who was at Arkham Media said, give me a lever in the proper fulcrum
[01:06:06.940 --> 01:06:08.660]   and I can move the world.
[01:06:08.660 --> 01:06:10.980]   This is the fulcrum is the smartphone.
[01:06:10.980 --> 01:06:13.740]   You are carrying a supercomputer in your pocket.
[01:06:13.740 --> 01:06:18.700]   If it weren't for that, you couldn't do the Cartier mobile or a whole lot of other things.
[01:06:18.700 --> 01:06:20.780]   It's because you couldn't put rabbit ears on yourself.
[01:06:20.780 --> 01:06:22.780]   We just rather take selfies.
[01:06:22.780 --> 01:06:23.780]   Slofy, sleigh.
[01:06:23.780 --> 01:06:27.620]   That's something you can't do on that new Pixel 4.
[01:06:27.620 --> 01:06:28.620]   At least I don't think so.
[01:06:28.620 --> 01:06:29.620]   Thank goodness.
[01:06:29.620 --> 01:06:30.620]   Yeah.
[01:06:30.620 --> 01:06:31.620]   That's a slow fee.
[01:06:31.620 --> 01:06:32.620]   Oh, you know what?
[01:06:32.620 --> 01:06:33.620]   Yeah.
[01:06:33.620 --> 01:06:34.620]   I'm sorry.
[01:06:34.620 --> 01:06:35.620]   I didn't know.
[01:06:35.620 --> 01:06:40.220]   So actually, this is one thing that I think is culturally telling the new iPhone will have
[01:06:40.220 --> 01:06:48.420]   three lenses on the back, kind of a telephoto medium and ultra wide all 12 megapixels.
[01:06:48.420 --> 01:06:52.540]   It will have for the first time an equivalent 12 megapixel camera on the front.
[01:06:52.540 --> 01:06:55.340]   Many of these front facing cameras are lower, lower, lower.
[01:06:55.340 --> 01:06:58.340]   So the selfies are a little lower quality.
[01:06:58.340 --> 01:07:04.180]   And for the first time ever, this 12 megapixel camera on the front can do slow motion.
[01:07:04.180 --> 01:07:08.100]   So we're ready for slow motion selfies.
[01:07:08.100 --> 01:07:09.620]   Got it.
[01:07:09.620 --> 01:07:11.460]   So Micah and I are watching the event.
[01:07:11.460 --> 01:07:13.460]   Micah is typing furiously as this is a...
[01:07:13.460 --> 01:07:14.460]   So what are you doing?
[01:07:14.460 --> 01:07:15.820]   He says, I'm getting a domain.
[01:07:15.820 --> 01:07:16.820]   Slofies.com.
[01:07:16.820 --> 01:07:22.380]   I said, Micah, it's not spelled to the pH.
[01:07:22.380 --> 01:07:27.020]   He bought two or three domains.
[01:07:27.020 --> 01:07:28.020]   S-L-O-P-H-I-E-S.
[01:07:28.020 --> 01:07:29.020]   Poor kid.
[01:07:29.020 --> 01:07:30.020]   Nice work, Micah.
[01:07:30.020 --> 01:07:31.820]   He was so mad.
[01:07:31.820 --> 01:07:35.380]   But that's how you sell phones though.
[01:07:35.380 --> 01:07:37.300]   And domain, web domains apparently.
[01:07:37.300 --> 01:07:43.260]   One thing that the Pixel 4 will have though, it looks like, is astrophotography.
[01:07:43.260 --> 01:07:46.060]   Oh, yeah, they talked about this last night.
[01:07:46.060 --> 01:07:49.060]   We talked about that last night on all the Android.
[01:07:49.060 --> 01:07:51.460]   And this comes from a video that Google...
[01:07:51.460 --> 01:07:53.260]   Well, see, this is the question.
[01:07:53.260 --> 01:07:55.340]   Was a leaked video.
[01:07:55.340 --> 01:07:58.100]   No, it's released if Google sent it out.
[01:07:58.100 --> 01:08:04.380]   Well, Google didn't send it out, but somebody found it.
[01:08:04.380 --> 01:08:06.100]   And it showed astrophotography.
[01:08:06.100 --> 01:08:08.700]   Now astrophotography, John's done a lot of this.
[01:08:08.700 --> 01:08:10.580]   John, of course, tripod, right?
[01:08:10.580 --> 01:08:11.580]   Because you can't...
[01:08:11.580 --> 01:08:12.580]   The camera cannot move.
[01:08:12.580 --> 01:08:13.580]   It's a must.
[01:08:13.580 --> 01:08:14.580]   Because you're going to do a long exposure.
[01:08:14.580 --> 01:08:16.020]   Oh, you've done it too, of course.
[01:08:16.020 --> 01:08:17.220]   Some must.
[01:08:17.220 --> 01:08:19.900]   How long is the exposure typically?
[01:08:19.900 --> 01:08:21.780]   You can start out at 30 seconds.
[01:08:21.780 --> 01:08:22.780]   You start it.
[01:08:22.780 --> 01:08:23.780]   Too long and you'll see star trails.
[01:08:23.780 --> 01:08:25.780]   You might want to see star trails.
[01:08:25.780 --> 01:08:29.060]   So it depends whether you want to see star trails or you just want to see the stars brighter
[01:08:29.060 --> 01:08:31.340]   against the background and all that.
[01:08:31.340 --> 01:08:35.700]   But that's something that traditionally you'd use a fancy camera and a tripod for.
[01:08:35.700 --> 01:08:38.740]   The thought that you could do this with a camera phone is mind-poggling.
[01:08:38.740 --> 01:08:42.340]   And being able to get that infinity focus on a phone.
[01:08:42.340 --> 01:08:44.580]   Well, that's another thing, isn't it?
[01:08:44.580 --> 01:08:45.580]   Oh, oh.
[01:08:45.580 --> 01:08:51.220]   This is, okay, again, a quote leaked promo video.
[01:08:51.220 --> 01:08:52.980]   It's definitely made by Google the video.
[01:08:52.980 --> 01:08:54.660]   Go ahead and play it.
[01:08:54.660 --> 01:08:58.220]   This is from proandroid.com.
[01:08:58.220 --> 01:09:03.660]   And it's just showing a lot of what happens when people who made this YouTube and Google
[01:09:03.660 --> 01:09:04.660]   Maps.
[01:09:04.660 --> 01:09:05.660]   I like this ad.
[01:09:05.660 --> 01:09:08.100]   This is probably going to be one of the ads for the Pixel 4.
[01:09:08.100 --> 01:09:12.260]   Then the Google way made this, a smartphone.
[01:09:12.260 --> 01:09:13.500]   And then they show some of the features.
[01:09:13.500 --> 01:09:16.220]   The gestures, you get an assistant.
[01:09:16.220 --> 01:09:17.500]   Of course, we all know that.
[01:09:17.500 --> 01:09:19.180]   It's fast.
[01:09:19.180 --> 01:09:21.340]   When you say, "Hey, you know who?
[01:09:21.340 --> 01:09:24.620]   Show me my photos of Tokyo, the ones with food.
[01:09:24.620 --> 01:09:25.620]   Share this."
[01:09:25.620 --> 01:09:26.620]   Look at that.
[01:09:26.620 --> 01:09:28.620]   Pretty cool with Jen.
[01:09:28.620 --> 01:09:29.620]   We all know about that.
[01:09:29.620 --> 01:09:31.580]   Now they're showing the camera bump.
[01:09:31.580 --> 01:09:34.260]   Helps you get perfect photos.
[01:09:34.260 --> 01:09:36.100]   And then here's the, even in the dark.
[01:09:36.100 --> 01:09:37.300]   So there's night sight.
[01:09:37.300 --> 01:09:40.940]   Apple, of course, achieved night sight parody with a new iPhone.
[01:09:40.940 --> 01:09:42.460]   You even get the stars.
[01:09:42.460 --> 01:09:44.420]   Now that is a star field.
[01:09:44.420 --> 01:09:46.180]   They don't show you how you do it.
[01:09:46.180 --> 01:09:47.180]   It's a setting.
[01:09:47.180 --> 01:09:49.180]   I'd be very curious.
[01:09:49.180 --> 01:09:51.140]   Wouldn't you, you have to have a tripod.
[01:09:51.140 --> 01:09:52.140]   Get yourself a tripod.
[01:09:52.140 --> 01:09:58.220]   I have a smartphone tripod mount that I use for longest photos with my phone.
[01:09:58.220 --> 01:10:02.540]   And you're going to have this extra computational photography in it now.
[01:10:02.540 --> 01:10:06.220]   I think it's just going to up the game a little bit.
[01:10:06.220 --> 01:10:07.220]   Astrophotography.
[01:10:07.220 --> 01:10:09.820]   They talked about it last night if you want to watch and learn more.
[01:10:09.820 --> 01:10:10.820]   All about Android.
[01:10:10.820 --> 01:10:11.820]   I was there.
[01:10:11.820 --> 01:10:12.820]   I was there.
[01:10:12.820 --> 01:10:17.540]   I sat right over there.
[01:10:17.540 --> 01:10:18.540]   What were you saying, Stacy?
[01:10:18.540 --> 01:10:19.540]   You've got a.
[01:10:19.540 --> 01:10:24.340]   Oh, I bought my first smartphone tripod way back in the day when I bought a flip camera.
[01:10:24.340 --> 01:10:25.340]   Oh, yeah.
[01:10:25.340 --> 01:10:26.340]   And I used it for that.
[01:10:26.340 --> 01:10:31.380]   Now I just, the big downside was when I am, when they took out the headphone jack, I suddenly
[01:10:31.380 --> 01:10:33.980]   lost my ability to do that.
[01:10:33.980 --> 01:10:34.980]   That was the release.
[01:10:34.980 --> 01:10:36.700]   Flips were going to change the world, weren't they?
[01:10:36.700 --> 01:10:38.900]   Now everybody can have a camera limiter.
[01:10:38.900 --> 01:10:39.900]   I know.
[01:10:39.900 --> 01:10:44.940]   This is actually another thing that you can blame on smartphones.
[01:10:44.940 --> 01:10:48.140]   The death really is a camcorder.
[01:10:48.140 --> 01:10:49.140]   What do you need a camcorder for?
[01:10:49.140 --> 01:10:51.340]   You've got a great video camera in your pocket.
[01:10:51.340 --> 01:10:56.140]   And to some degree, the death, yeah, we, we by the way, bought up the entire stock of
[01:10:56.140 --> 01:10:59.020]   Canon Vixia camcorders for this network.
[01:10:59.020 --> 01:11:01.780]   And then by the way, the death, almost death of point and shoot cameras.
[01:11:01.780 --> 01:11:04.340]   You hardly see point and shoot cameras anymore, right?
[01:11:04.340 --> 01:11:07.740]   No, you see those artsy, fart, see people.
[01:11:07.740 --> 01:11:13.980]   Oh, you mean like, like the loomography, like the kind of intentionally bad Russian.
[01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:18.620]   Well, it's in the like, like, oh, you know, and Om is not artsy fartsy, but he is kind
[01:11:18.620 --> 01:11:19.620]   of artsy fartsy.
[01:11:19.620 --> 01:11:23.500]   He'll, he'll understand when I call him that, but he, he doesn't shoot with digital anymore.
[01:11:23.500 --> 01:11:24.500]   He only shoots film.
[01:11:24.500 --> 01:11:25.500]   He shoots film?
[01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:26.500]   Oh, geez.
[01:11:26.500 --> 01:11:27.500]   Oh, yeah.
[01:11:27.500 --> 01:11:28.500]   He's a good photographer.
[01:11:28.500 --> 01:11:29.500]   He's a very good photographer.
[01:11:29.500 --> 01:11:33.260]   But that's the, I don't own a television of 2019.
[01:11:33.260 --> 01:11:36.940]   You know, the, the, there you go.
[01:11:36.940 --> 01:11:43.260]   The impact of smartphones in the camera industry, this is from CIPA and Statista.com.
[01:11:43.260 --> 01:11:49.980]   And you see the rise, the blue line of the camera, the digital camera, real great until
[01:11:49.980 --> 01:11:56.260]   the, until the digital phone came out and boom, it just plummets and lines cross.
[01:11:56.260 --> 01:11:58.260]   But they need to break that down a little bit.
[01:11:58.260 --> 01:11:59.260]   This is all cameras.
[01:11:59.260 --> 01:12:00.820]   This is not just point and shoot cameras.
[01:12:00.820 --> 01:12:01.820]   This is all cameras.
[01:12:01.820 --> 01:12:06.900]   They need to break that down a little bit more because there are people with a, a, a
[01:12:06.900 --> 01:12:13.060]   awesome iPhone camera, awesome galaxy camera that still walks up and asks me, Hey, what
[01:12:13.060 --> 01:12:14.060]   camera should I go?
[01:12:14.060 --> 01:12:15.820]   Hi, but these are hobbyists.
[01:12:15.820 --> 01:12:16.820]   These are enthusiasts.
[01:12:16.820 --> 01:12:18.380]   These are not regular people.
[01:12:18.380 --> 01:12:20.380]   And honestly, I don't think that's a bad thing.
[01:12:20.380 --> 01:12:27.060]   I think you're almost any high end smartphone today takes superb pictures better than many
[01:12:27.060 --> 01:12:28.860]   point and shoot cameras.
[01:12:28.860 --> 01:12:33.500]   And if you're not an accomplished photographer, maybe even better than a very fancy camera.
[01:12:33.500 --> 01:12:34.500]   Oh, very much so.
[01:12:34.500 --> 01:12:35.500]   Yeah.
[01:12:35.500 --> 01:12:36.500]   Because he's doing all the work.
[01:12:36.500 --> 01:12:37.500]   This is computational.
[01:12:37.500 --> 01:12:40.420]   A little more professional photographer.
[01:12:40.420 --> 01:12:47.540]   So I'm looking at, oh, Malek's, uh, the problem with doing film, does he develop it himself?
[01:12:47.540 --> 01:12:49.180]   So where do you get a process to be more?
[01:12:49.180 --> 01:12:50.180]   I mean, they're labs.
[01:12:50.180 --> 01:12:51.180]   Not his labs out there.
[01:12:51.180 --> 01:12:52.180]   I don't know.
[01:12:52.180 --> 01:12:54.620]   But you know what they do mostly?
[01:12:54.620 --> 01:12:55.620]   They just scan.
[01:12:55.620 --> 01:12:56.620]   Or they scan them.
[01:12:56.620 --> 01:12:57.620]   They just scan them.
[01:12:57.620 --> 01:13:00.500]   Then you import them into a, oh, he has digital files.
[01:13:00.500 --> 01:13:02.580]   He'll send you of the pictures.
[01:13:02.580 --> 01:13:04.700]   So I'm not an under picture, but he.
[01:13:04.700 --> 01:13:05.700]   Yeah.
[01:13:05.700 --> 01:13:09.620]   Look at this article that Ohm just wrote September 3rd.
[01:13:09.620 --> 01:13:12.420]   Camera sales are falling sharply.
[01:13:12.420 --> 01:13:15.100]   Uh, we're in it.
[01:13:15.100 --> 01:13:18.340]   We're in the end times for camera sales.
[01:13:18.340 --> 01:13:20.340]   It's become, it's, it's like a record player.
[01:13:20.340 --> 01:13:23.380]   It's become a specialty product.
[01:13:23.380 --> 01:13:26.100]   Although record players are coming back.
[01:13:26.100 --> 01:13:27.260]   Okay.
[01:13:27.260 --> 01:13:32.500]   So the stat is vinyl records outsold CDs for the first time ever, right?
[01:13:32.500 --> 01:13:33.500]   Right.
[01:13:33.500 --> 01:13:36.500]   One's buying CDs.
[01:13:36.500 --> 01:13:40.780]   Power and Stern makes such fun of Gary and Labbate for getting vinyl.
[01:13:40.780 --> 01:13:43.300]   Because it's the most ridiculous habit on it.
[01:13:43.300 --> 01:13:46.340]   We probably should steal something out of the change log.
[01:13:46.340 --> 01:13:47.340]   Because it's relevant.
[01:13:47.340 --> 01:13:48.340]   CBS story.
[01:13:48.340 --> 01:13:50.420]   Uh, let me scroll down.
[01:13:50.420 --> 01:13:54.140]   Google photos get same day pickup for prints at CBS.
[01:13:54.140 --> 01:13:55.620]   That's brilliant, I think.
[01:13:55.620 --> 01:13:57.060]   Oh, that is brilliant.
[01:13:57.060 --> 01:14:02.220]   Cause I can't tell you how many times my daughter still has to print photographs for school.
[01:14:02.220 --> 01:14:05.900]   So, or you, yeah, you got the fancy printer.
[01:14:05.900 --> 01:14:07.900]   It's a pain in the butt to do it.
[01:14:07.900 --> 01:14:08.900]   They would go to them.
[01:14:08.900 --> 01:14:15.340]   Well, it also saves cause CBS has a big photo processing prayer in the back.
[01:14:15.340 --> 01:14:16.340]   All of the great equipment.
[01:14:16.340 --> 01:14:17.340]   Grading.
[01:14:17.340 --> 01:14:20.340]   They spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on it.
[01:14:20.340 --> 01:14:24.180]   So now what you do is you actually can do this in Google photos.
[01:14:24.180 --> 01:14:27.580]   Uh, and you say, I'll pick it up at my local CVS.
[01:14:27.580 --> 01:14:28.580]   I think that's awesome.
[01:14:28.580 --> 01:14:29.580]   Now I don't know how good the prints are.
[01:14:29.580 --> 01:14:32.380]   It's using a codec system called moments.
[01:14:32.380 --> 01:14:37.780]   Uh, we used to send ours to Walmart when we had to do the more best buy or cost code.
[01:14:37.780 --> 01:14:38.780]   Yeah.
[01:14:38.780 --> 01:14:39.780]   Yeah.
[01:14:39.780 --> 01:14:40.780]   We've done a lot of this.
[01:14:40.780 --> 01:14:42.980]   They do it as straight from Google photos is actually kind of nice.
[01:14:42.980 --> 01:14:44.260]   That's pretty funny.
[01:14:44.260 --> 01:14:45.260]   My son's is the open.
[01:14:45.260 --> 01:14:47.180]   It's his photos.
[01:14:47.180 --> 01:14:48.700]   I like photo books.
[01:14:48.700 --> 01:14:49.700]   He still prints his.
[01:14:49.700 --> 01:14:52.020]   I think there's something about having prints.
[01:14:52.020 --> 01:14:53.580]   Of course, we have kids.
[01:14:53.580 --> 01:14:58.740]   You want, my kids would just pull down the photos themselves and spend hours going, you
[01:14:58.740 --> 01:15:01.660]   know, it's, it's certain ego of a child going through it.
[01:15:01.660 --> 01:15:03.340]   But they go through all those photos.
[01:15:03.340 --> 01:15:04.340]   Yeah.
[01:15:04.340 --> 01:15:06.300]   Here's a flip when you have these Google devices.
[01:15:06.300 --> 01:15:11.260]   So I have, I have one that's sitting on my desk and it shows all my Google photos, which
[01:15:11.260 --> 01:15:15.580]   by the way, my husband, like, if I'm taking a picture of something, he's like, you probably
[01:15:15.580 --> 01:15:16.660]   want to delete that receipt.
[01:15:16.660 --> 01:15:19.540]   So it doesn't show up on your Google photos in a few minutes.
[01:15:19.540 --> 01:15:20.900]   But, uh, wait a minute.
[01:15:20.900 --> 01:15:21.900]   Right.
[01:15:21.900 --> 01:15:22.900]   No way.
[01:15:22.900 --> 01:15:23.900]   Google photos.
[01:15:23.900 --> 01:15:27.380]   You've not seen this because probably because you're deleting receipts after a while, Google
[01:15:27.380 --> 01:15:29.740]   photos will say, I see, I have all of these receipts.
[01:15:29.740 --> 01:15:31.660]   You want me to move these to the archives?
[01:15:31.660 --> 01:15:33.980]   You don't want these in the photos, do you?
[01:15:33.980 --> 01:15:35.860]   They offer that for screenshots and receipts.
[01:15:35.860 --> 01:15:37.780]   And notes and whiteboards.
[01:15:37.780 --> 01:15:38.780]   And whiteboards.
[01:15:38.780 --> 01:15:40.820]   I've seen archives or something else.
[01:15:40.820 --> 01:15:42.740]   I didn't know it was just smart.
[01:15:42.740 --> 01:15:47.820]   It is smart, but this is, this is things like, you know, take a picture of this mole.
[01:15:47.820 --> 01:15:51.540]   No one wants to see that up close on the, you know, I don't know.
[01:15:51.540 --> 01:15:54.540]   I've said that to Google's health thing for the melanoma diagnosis.
[01:15:54.540 --> 01:16:00.940]   Anyway, the point is my daughter and her friends will sit there in front of this photo display.
[01:16:00.940 --> 01:16:02.340]   Looking at the receipts.
[01:16:02.340 --> 01:16:03.340]   Watch it.
[01:16:03.340 --> 01:16:04.340]   Oh, yes.
[01:16:04.340 --> 01:16:06.340]   That's why I like my Nest Hub Max.
[01:16:06.340 --> 01:16:07.340]   Yeah.
[01:16:07.340 --> 01:16:09.660]   I mean, I love it.
[01:16:09.660 --> 01:16:16.340]   So what you can do with the Nest hub and the Nest Hub Max is it, you can have a photo slideshow,
[01:16:16.340 --> 01:16:20.140]   but it lets you say, oh, this person, this person and this person.
[01:16:20.140 --> 01:16:22.220]   So it uses face recognition.
[01:16:22.220 --> 01:16:28.580]   So any picture of me, Lisa, or my kids, it goes in there and it's pictures.
[01:16:28.580 --> 01:16:29.940]   I've up there are 60.
[01:16:29.940 --> 01:16:32.620]   I have pictures from 20, almost 20 years of photography.
[01:16:32.620 --> 01:16:33.620]   Yeah.
[01:16:33.620 --> 01:16:34.620]   There you go.
[01:16:34.620 --> 01:16:35.620]   Isn't that awesome?
[01:16:35.620 --> 01:16:37.540]   So you see, is that your wedding?
[01:16:37.540 --> 01:16:39.900]   No, that's we were at a thing.
[01:16:39.900 --> 01:16:40.900]   I'm trying to.
[01:16:40.900 --> 01:16:42.100]   There's my dog.
[01:16:42.100 --> 01:16:43.100]   Yeah.
[01:16:43.100 --> 01:16:48.140]   And you can pick which albums that you want to go by albums, but I go by face recognition.
[01:16:48.140 --> 01:16:49.140]   So then it's everything.
[01:16:49.140 --> 01:16:52.820]   It's if it's a picture of one of my kids or if it's a picture, basically, of a family
[01:16:52.820 --> 01:16:54.460]   member, it shows that.
[01:16:54.460 --> 01:16:58.580]   And it's fun because you get, I'll wake up and I'll look over and there's a picture
[01:16:58.580 --> 01:17:00.940]   from 15 years ago of my son.
[01:17:00.940 --> 01:17:01.940]   All right.
[01:17:01.940 --> 01:17:04.020]   And it's like, oh, that all moment.
[01:17:04.020 --> 01:17:05.020]   I love it.
[01:17:05.020 --> 01:17:06.020]   No.
[01:17:06.020 --> 01:17:07.020]   Well, it's awesome.
[01:17:07.020 --> 01:17:08.020]   They're super nice to have her on the house.
[01:17:08.020 --> 01:17:11.460]   It solves a problem because we take so many pictures that we're probably never going to
[01:17:11.460 --> 01:17:12.460]   see again.
[01:17:12.460 --> 01:17:13.460]   True.
[01:17:13.460 --> 01:17:17.220]   So it's nice to have a way to kind of get those pictures back to life.
[01:17:17.220 --> 01:17:18.220]   That's pretty silly.
[01:17:18.220 --> 01:17:26.180]   And it's I will also say that when my daughter was in Spain, we synced up her account.
[01:17:26.180 --> 01:17:30.780]   We shared a Google account, a photo album with the family that was hosting her.
[01:17:30.780 --> 01:17:35.060]   So as they took pictures of her, then they would just pop up and circulate through on
[01:17:35.060 --> 01:17:36.940]   our photo display.
[01:17:36.940 --> 01:17:38.220]   That was super fun.
[01:17:38.220 --> 01:17:42.700]   I thought that's very sweet, very nice.
[01:17:42.700 --> 01:17:48.500]   But they also took pictures of Anna and us and they actually printed the ballot and stuck
[01:17:48.500 --> 01:17:51.380]   them in a frame in her little room that she was staying in.
[01:17:51.380 --> 01:17:56.060]   So look, both high tech and low tech, very special.
[01:17:56.060 --> 01:17:58.900]   Oh, I get it.
[01:17:58.900 --> 01:18:01.700]   Oh, I'm is shooting with a Leica SL film camera.
[01:18:01.700 --> 01:18:02.700]   Oh, yeah.
[01:18:02.700 --> 01:18:05.220]   I get it.
[01:18:05.220 --> 01:18:09.020]   He's always been a Leica guy, but he's gone to film now.
[01:18:09.020 --> 01:18:10.020]   That's outstanding.
[01:18:10.020 --> 01:18:11.020]   Yeah.
[01:18:11.020 --> 01:18:14.660]   Two thirds of my photos are shot with a camera on a tripod.
[01:18:14.660 --> 01:18:17.260]   So he's one of those because he has to.
[01:18:17.260 --> 01:18:18.260]   He's one.
[01:18:18.260 --> 01:18:20.180]   Yeah, quite frankly, he has to.
[01:18:20.180 --> 01:18:21.420]   He's really fit.
[01:18:21.420 --> 01:18:22.580]   They're beautiful photos.
[01:18:22.580 --> 01:18:23.580]   They're gorgeous.
[01:18:23.580 --> 01:18:24.580]   They're art.
[01:18:24.580 --> 01:18:25.580]   Yeah.
[01:18:25.580 --> 01:18:30.340]   I actually so I have printed some up and I'm waiting for them to arrive when they arrive.
[01:18:30.340 --> 01:18:31.340]   I can show you guys.
[01:18:31.340 --> 01:18:32.340]   Very nice.
[01:18:32.340 --> 01:18:34.180]   There's a Venice at night.
[01:18:34.180 --> 01:18:35.180]   Yeah.
[01:18:35.180 --> 01:18:36.340]   Nice.
[01:18:36.340 --> 01:18:42.180]   So I went on a photo expedition some years ago with my good friend, Michael Allen, who's
[01:18:42.180 --> 01:18:45.860]   a great photographer to Tasmania and Australia.
[01:18:45.860 --> 01:18:52.580]   And all of us, you know, Peter Crow, Michael, all of them, they're about 20 pros.
[01:18:52.580 --> 01:18:58.460]   Was two weeks, typically six, seven, eight thousand photos, you know, because it's digitally
[01:18:58.460 --> 01:18:59.940]   you're shooting.
[01:18:59.940 --> 01:19:08.460]   There was one guy, Charlie, who was a he was shooting a medium format big.
[01:19:08.460 --> 01:19:09.940]   He had like 30.
[01:19:09.940 --> 01:19:10.940]   Yeah.
[01:19:10.940 --> 01:19:17.100]   He also brought with him a cardboard frame that he would carry around looking at things
[01:19:17.100 --> 01:19:19.540]   to see what it was going to look like in the shot.
[01:19:19.540 --> 01:19:20.740]   Everything was very methodical.
[01:19:20.740 --> 01:19:22.660]   It's very methodical.
[01:19:22.660 --> 01:19:23.900]   Those view cameras.
[01:19:23.900 --> 01:19:27.940]   I mean, it's just, you know what?
[01:19:27.940 --> 01:19:28.940]   It's it's hard.
[01:19:28.940 --> 01:19:31.140]   And I think that's what's going to end up happening to photography.
[01:19:31.140 --> 01:19:35.540]   You and I are big photo buffs, but it's going to be photo buffs because everybody else is
[01:19:35.540 --> 01:19:38.660]   going to use their camera phone.
[01:19:38.660 --> 01:19:43.100]   Kevin pointed out another additional thing about the Google photo frame.
[01:19:43.100 --> 01:19:44.100]   Should anyone care?
[01:19:44.100 --> 01:19:45.100]   Yes.
[01:19:45.100 --> 01:19:48.580]   You can actually create public albums and people can subscribe to them.
[01:19:48.580 --> 01:19:52.540]   So if you wanted to, you could subscribe to Kevin's dogs album.
[01:19:52.540 --> 01:19:55.340]   Well, you know who did that first.
[01:19:55.340 --> 01:19:57.900]   I thought that was already available in Google photos.
[01:19:57.900 --> 01:19:58.900]   You know who did that first.
[01:19:58.900 --> 01:20:00.140]   Oh, it totally, yeah, it's in Google photos.
[01:20:00.140 --> 01:20:01.780]   But now you can see it.
[01:20:01.780 --> 01:20:07.140]   Remember Mike when he got off Facebook, he's created Mike's Nice Book, which was how he
[01:20:07.140 --> 01:20:09.420]   shared photos with everybody.
[01:20:09.420 --> 01:20:14.660]   And it's pretty much every day I get, Mike has uploaded 10 more pictures to Mike's Nice
[01:20:14.660 --> 01:20:16.500]   Book.
[01:20:16.500 --> 01:20:18.740]   I think I might have unsubscribed.
[01:20:18.740 --> 01:20:20.180]   I'm not saying I have.
[01:20:20.180 --> 01:20:22.340]   I'm not saying I haven't.
[01:20:22.340 --> 01:20:23.340]   Sorry, Mike.
[01:20:23.340 --> 01:20:24.340]   We know you still love Mike.
[01:20:24.340 --> 01:20:25.340]   No, it's oh, I love Mike.
[01:20:25.340 --> 01:20:26.340]   It's a good idea.
[01:20:26.340 --> 01:20:28.340]   Mostly it's because I'm jealous because of all his pictures.
[01:20:28.340 --> 01:20:29.340]   Oh, I'm in Prosecco now.
[01:20:29.340 --> 01:20:31.820]   Oh, I'm in the south of France now.
[01:20:31.820 --> 01:20:34.340]   Get out of here.
[01:20:34.340 --> 01:20:36.340]   Yeah.
[01:20:36.340 --> 01:20:38.060]   YouTube is shutting down.
[01:20:38.060 --> 01:20:39.500]   Actually before we do that, let me do a break.
[01:20:39.500 --> 01:20:43.660]   And then I will tell you what YouTube is shutting down.
[01:20:43.660 --> 01:20:44.660]   Our show did it.
[01:20:44.660 --> 01:20:46.900]   It's great to have Aunt Pruitt on the panel with us.
[01:20:46.900 --> 01:20:47.900]   Yes, it is.
[01:20:47.900 --> 01:20:48.900]   Thank you.
[01:20:48.900 --> 01:20:49.900]   Thank you.
[01:20:49.900 --> 01:20:50.900]   Thank you.
[01:20:50.900 --> 01:20:51.900]   Always been happy with each other.
[01:20:51.900 --> 01:20:53.780]   It has this nice calm centered.
[01:20:53.780 --> 01:20:54.780]   I try.
[01:20:54.780 --> 01:20:57.940]   When Jeff and I are yelling at each other, Ants just like.
[01:20:57.940 --> 01:20:59.460]   Yeah, they can just have.
[01:20:59.460 --> 01:21:00.460]   I have a thought.
[01:21:00.460 --> 01:21:03.940]   Usually I'm shaking my head.
[01:21:03.940 --> 01:21:05.580]   You people.
[01:21:05.580 --> 01:21:07.020]   We're not yelling at each other.
[01:21:07.020 --> 01:21:08.980]   We're yelling about things with each other.
[01:21:08.980 --> 01:21:09.980]   You know what is neat though?
[01:21:09.980 --> 01:21:12.580]   Oh, no, I'm yelling at you, Jeff.
[01:21:12.580 --> 01:21:14.740]   I think this is because...
[01:21:14.740 --> 01:21:16.060]   Like listen to me.
[01:21:16.060 --> 01:21:19.340]   I think this is because Dan was brought up in... was it Alabama?
[01:21:19.340 --> 01:21:20.340]   Mississippi?
[01:21:20.340 --> 01:21:21.340]   Mm-hmm.
[01:21:21.340 --> 01:21:22.340]   Carolina, South Carolina?
[01:21:22.340 --> 01:21:23.340]   Sorry.
[01:21:23.340 --> 01:21:24.340]   It was one of them.
[01:21:24.340 --> 01:21:26.420]   One of them Southern states.
[01:21:26.420 --> 01:21:28.660]   He calls Lisa Miss Lisa.
[01:21:28.660 --> 01:21:29.660]   Yes?
[01:21:29.660 --> 01:21:32.220]   He calls people Miss like Miss Stacy.
[01:21:32.220 --> 01:21:33.220]   What do you do with guys though?
[01:21:33.220 --> 01:21:34.220]   You're calling Mr. Jeff.
[01:21:34.220 --> 01:21:37.060]   You are Mr. Leo and that's Mr. Mr. Carson.
[01:21:37.060 --> 01:21:38.060]   Mr. Carson?
[01:21:38.060 --> 01:21:40.700]   That's just because of Harvard.
[01:21:40.700 --> 01:21:42.540]   That is not because of Harvard.
[01:21:42.540 --> 01:21:44.460]   It's very sweet, but I'm trying to break him of it.
[01:21:44.460 --> 01:21:46.780]   I don't know if that will happen.
[01:21:46.780 --> 01:21:47.780]   It is what it is.
[01:21:47.780 --> 01:21:48.780]   Yeah.
[01:21:48.780 --> 01:21:49.780]   I like the...
[01:21:49.780 --> 01:21:52.380]   If I didn't like you, you would be Leo.
[01:21:52.380 --> 01:21:53.380]   Oh, really?
[01:21:53.380 --> 01:21:55.260]   So Mr. Leo is better.
[01:21:55.260 --> 01:21:58.100]   It's because I like you.
[01:21:58.100 --> 01:21:59.100]   And then...
[01:21:59.100 --> 01:22:00.900]   I'm sure this is true in Texas too.
[01:22:00.900 --> 01:22:02.300]   Sur and ma'am all the time.
[01:22:02.300 --> 01:22:03.620]   Yeah, I like it.
[01:22:03.620 --> 01:22:04.620]   It's very...
[01:22:04.620 --> 01:22:06.420]   You gotta get your New Jersey, you'll say, "Yo."
[01:22:06.420 --> 01:22:07.420]   Yo.
[01:22:07.420 --> 01:22:09.420]   How you doing, Mr. Leo?
[01:22:09.420 --> 01:22:10.420]   Yo.
[01:22:10.420 --> 01:22:11.940]   That's normally how I tweet.
[01:22:11.940 --> 01:22:12.940]   Yo.
[01:22:12.940 --> 01:22:13.940]   Leo.
[01:22:13.940 --> 01:22:14.940]   Hey, Leo.
[01:22:14.940 --> 01:22:17.100]   How you doing?
[01:22:17.100 --> 01:22:18.780]   That's Jeff Jarvis there.
[01:22:18.780 --> 01:22:19.780]   He's in Times Square.
[01:22:19.780 --> 01:22:20.780]   I've been Jersey.
[01:22:20.780 --> 01:22:21.780]   Now he's in Jersey.
[01:22:21.780 --> 01:22:22.780]   Yeah, no.
[01:22:22.780 --> 01:22:23.780]   I know.
[01:22:23.780 --> 01:22:24.780]   I don't got a problem.
[01:22:24.780 --> 01:22:26.260]   You're in the nice part of Jersey though.
[01:22:26.260 --> 01:22:27.260]   You're not in the Jersey shore.
[01:22:27.260 --> 01:22:28.260]   It's all nice, Leo.
[01:22:28.260 --> 01:22:29.260]   What are you saying?
[01:22:29.260 --> 01:22:30.260]   No.
[01:22:30.260 --> 01:22:31.260]   I'm nice, no.
[01:22:31.260 --> 01:22:32.260]   It's all nice.
[01:22:32.260 --> 01:22:35.380]   If you go to New York City and then you cross over the river to Jersey, you're gonna
[01:22:35.380 --> 01:22:37.820]   see a different kind of Jersey.
[01:22:37.820 --> 01:22:40.860]   You're gonna say, "Why do they call this the garden state?"
[01:22:40.860 --> 01:22:43.260]   'Cause it's kind of industrialized, right?
[01:22:43.260 --> 01:22:44.740]   But you're in the more of the beautiful...
[01:22:44.740 --> 01:22:46.380]   Feeding the needs of America.
[01:22:46.380 --> 01:22:48.700]   That's true.
[01:22:48.700 --> 01:22:52.740]   All of those phony flavors they put in McDonald's French fries, those come from New Jersey.
[01:22:52.740 --> 01:22:53.740]   Oh, really?
[01:22:53.740 --> 01:22:54.740]   Just over the river.
[01:22:54.740 --> 01:22:55.740]   Oh, I think...
[01:22:55.740 --> 01:22:56.980]   Oh, 'cause I pass by...
[01:22:56.980 --> 01:22:59.220]   It smells good, doesn't it?
[01:22:59.220 --> 01:23:05.380]   When the roads are really crowded, I pass by this place across from the Essex County
[01:23:05.380 --> 01:23:06.380]   prison.
[01:23:06.380 --> 01:23:08.180]   Is it in Elizabeth?
[01:23:08.180 --> 01:23:09.180]   No.
[01:23:09.180 --> 01:23:11.380]   'Cause Elizabeth is where they make a lot of the...
[01:23:11.380 --> 01:23:13.220]   Home of the food flavor.
[01:23:13.220 --> 01:23:14.220]   Food flavor.
[01:23:14.220 --> 01:23:19.380]   There's another food flavor place and it looks like the worst factory you've ever seen.
[01:23:19.380 --> 01:23:20.380]   Yeah.
[01:23:20.380 --> 01:23:21.380]   Oh man.
[01:23:21.380 --> 01:23:22.380]   It smells good.
[01:23:22.380 --> 01:23:23.820]   No, actually, this is a good...
[01:23:23.820 --> 01:23:24.820]   It smells good, though.
[01:23:24.820 --> 01:23:25.820]   What does it smell like?
[01:23:25.820 --> 01:23:26.820]   Nothing.
[01:23:26.820 --> 01:23:28.900]   It smells like diesel fumes with the trucks going in.
[01:23:28.900 --> 01:23:30.820]   I don't think that's the food flavor.
[01:23:30.820 --> 01:23:31.820]   Flaming plants.
[01:23:31.820 --> 01:23:33.820]   That's just a factory.
[01:23:33.820 --> 01:23:35.820]   Does it smell like Mondays?
[01:23:35.820 --> 01:23:37.980]   Oh, no, it's a factory flavor.
[01:23:37.980 --> 01:23:40.380]   It is a flavor of food flavor factory.
[01:23:40.380 --> 01:23:41.380]   Oh, that's true.
[01:23:41.380 --> 01:23:42.380]   That's a flavor factory.
[01:23:42.380 --> 01:23:43.380]   Yeah.
[01:23:43.380 --> 01:23:44.380]   Flavor Flav.
[01:23:44.380 --> 01:23:48.780]   Here is, by the way, thanks to Gigas Stacy in our chatroom.
[01:23:48.780 --> 01:23:51.380]   Norm's photo album.
[01:23:51.380 --> 01:23:52.300]   Norm!
[01:23:52.300 --> 01:23:53.300]   Oh, no.
[01:23:53.300 --> 01:23:54.300]   Oh, no.
[01:23:54.300 --> 01:23:55.820]   Kevin Tuffles, beautiful.
[01:23:55.820 --> 01:23:56.820]   Is he a cockapoo?
[01:23:56.820 --> 01:23:59.020]   I think he's a bee shop.
[01:23:59.020 --> 01:24:00.820]   Oh, he's a bee shop for saying, yeah.
[01:24:00.820 --> 01:24:01.820]   Oh, no.
[01:24:01.820 --> 01:24:04.420]   See, is this great?
[01:24:04.420 --> 01:24:07.180]   So anybody could subscribe to this if they knew how.
[01:24:07.180 --> 01:24:08.180]   Yeah, look.
[01:24:08.180 --> 01:24:09.180]   Just join it.
[01:24:09.180 --> 01:24:10.500]   Join, but you gotta have the link.
[01:24:10.500 --> 01:24:12.100]   That's the problem and the link is long.
[01:24:12.100 --> 01:24:13.340]   That's why I put it in the chatroom.
[01:24:13.340 --> 01:24:14.340]   Right.
[01:24:14.340 --> 01:24:15.820]   Anybody in the chatroom can join it.
[01:24:15.820 --> 01:24:17.700]   I've just joined it.
[01:24:17.700 --> 01:24:18.700]   So now I'm gonna get my...
[01:24:18.700 --> 01:24:20.460]   You may have to unsubscribe, yeah.
[01:24:20.460 --> 01:24:21.460]   Norm.
[01:24:21.460 --> 01:24:23.460]   I'm going Instagram, so I always see you.
[01:24:23.460 --> 01:24:24.460]   Oh, there you go.
[01:24:24.460 --> 01:24:25.460]   I prefer this to Instagram.
[01:24:25.460 --> 01:24:28.500]   I don't want to participate in Instagram.
[01:24:28.500 --> 01:24:29.500]   That's Stacy Higgins.
[01:24:29.500 --> 01:24:33.420]   Bathamstacian.com.
[01:24:33.420 --> 01:24:35.500]   Love having Stacy on the show, too.
[01:24:35.500 --> 01:24:36.500]   This is my...
[01:24:36.500 --> 01:24:39.380]   I should look forward to this show all week long.
[01:24:39.380 --> 01:24:43.620]   Our show today brought to you by a tool that we started using to plan shows that I love
[01:24:43.620 --> 01:24:44.620]   called Monday.com.
[01:24:44.620 --> 01:24:47.820]   If you play with Monday.com, it's really neat.
[01:24:47.820 --> 01:24:55.380]   It helps teams manage work and meet deadlines, but it also builds a culture of transparency.
[01:24:55.380 --> 01:25:01.780]   All the knowledge is stored on the Monday.com site so that you know everybody knows what's
[01:25:01.780 --> 01:25:03.700]   going on.
[01:25:03.700 --> 01:25:06.260]   Everybody knows who's working on what the state of it is.
[01:25:06.260 --> 01:25:09.460]   If you need information, this is where you'll find it.
[01:25:09.460 --> 01:25:14.900]   It's the next step past a messaging system or an email system.
[01:25:14.900 --> 01:25:20.460]   Once you manage all your core business activities in one place, from high level roadmap to specific
[01:25:20.460 --> 01:25:23.060]   day-to-day tasks, very popular.
[01:25:23.060 --> 01:25:24.820]   The more people use this, the more they love it.
[01:25:24.820 --> 01:25:27.380]   65,000 teams now use Monday.com.
[01:25:27.380 --> 01:25:30.060]   I really want you to try it, too.
[01:25:30.060 --> 01:25:31.060]   Very easy to start.
[01:25:31.060 --> 01:25:35.500]   They give you a bunch of templates, or you can build a board from scratch, or you can
[01:25:35.500 --> 01:25:37.380]   take a template and customize it.
[01:25:37.380 --> 01:25:40.820]   There are templates for every possible situation.
[01:25:40.820 --> 01:25:44.700]   You can automate your workflows with reminders with notifications.
[01:25:44.700 --> 01:25:49.860]   Of course, there are Monday apps for your phone, so you take it with you everywhere.
[01:25:49.860 --> 01:25:53.820]   Those notifications can be very useful, but you have complete control over them.
[01:25:53.820 --> 01:25:55.260]   It's great for teams of any sizes.
[01:25:55.260 --> 01:25:59.940]   A lot of two-person freelance teams in different locations will use Monday.com to organize their
[01:25:59.940 --> 01:26:02.940]   work to stay in touch to keep things flowing.
[01:26:02.940 --> 01:26:07.620]   There are also teams of thousands using Monday.com all over the globe.
[01:26:07.620 --> 01:26:13.500]   It replaces all the whiteboards, Excel files, and most importantly, replaces long-boring
[01:26:13.500 --> 01:26:15.340]   meetings.
[01:26:15.340 --> 01:26:17.460]   Stay on track with Monday.com.
[01:26:17.460 --> 01:26:18.700]   You look forward to Monday.
[01:26:18.700 --> 01:26:20.060]   That's why they call it Monday.
[01:26:20.060 --> 01:26:22.780]   Create accountability by assigning owners to keep track of who's doing what.
[01:26:22.780 --> 01:26:24.180]   Never miss a deadline.
[01:26:24.180 --> 01:26:28.900]   With the My Week page, it's basically a personal assistant for you and your team, but it's
[01:26:28.900 --> 01:26:29.900]   affordable.
[01:26:29.900 --> 01:26:31.540]   It's easy and you're going to love it.
[01:26:31.540 --> 01:26:34.740]   Stay in control anywhere you go with a Monday.com mobile app.
[01:26:34.740 --> 01:26:37.060]   I know I try these tools.
[01:26:37.060 --> 01:26:38.980]   I'm a serial tool trier.
[01:26:38.980 --> 01:26:39.980]   This is the one.
[01:26:39.980 --> 01:26:41.140]   You really got to try it.
[01:26:41.140 --> 01:26:44.100]   You're going to love it and see what it can do for you.
[01:26:44.100 --> 01:26:47.060]   Start your 14-day free trial right now at Monday.
[01:26:47.060 --> 01:26:51.860]   M-O-N-D-A-Y, the day of the week, Monday.com/twig.
[01:26:51.860 --> 01:26:53.900]   Monday.com/twig.
[01:26:53.900 --> 01:26:58.700]   This is a productivity tool you'll want to use.
[01:26:58.700 --> 01:27:01.540]   You'll really want to use.
[01:27:01.540 --> 01:27:03.740]   Thank you Monday for supporting this week in Google.
[01:27:03.740 --> 01:27:08.740]   Thank you for supporting us by going to Monday.com/twig.
[01:27:08.740 --> 01:27:12.020]   I haven't seen the new memories on Google Photos since we're talking about Google Photos.
[01:27:12.020 --> 01:27:13.540]   Maybe let's just do the change log.
[01:27:13.540 --> 01:27:14.620]   Let's just do it.
[01:27:14.620 --> 01:27:15.620]   This would be change log.
[01:27:15.620 --> 01:27:16.620]   You're the music.
[01:27:16.620 --> 01:27:17.620]   Surprise, Karsten.
[01:27:17.620 --> 01:27:18.620]   Surprise.
[01:27:18.620 --> 01:27:19.620]   So mean.
[01:27:19.620 --> 01:27:20.620]   So mean.
[01:27:20.620 --> 01:27:21.620]   So mean.
[01:27:21.620 --> 01:27:28.260]   The Google change log.
[01:27:28.260 --> 01:27:32.140]   By the way, a tech in San Diego says he tried the McCallen 25.
[01:27:32.140 --> 01:27:34.340]   Your pick of the week last week on Windows Weekly.
[01:27:34.340 --> 01:27:36.020]   Oh, no, that was McCallen 12.
[01:27:36.020 --> 01:27:38.020]   Oh, he tried the 25.
[01:27:38.020 --> 01:27:39.020]   I see that.
[01:27:39.020 --> 01:27:40.020]   So good and smooth.
[01:27:40.020 --> 01:27:41.020]   Best sip and whiskey ever.
[01:27:41.020 --> 01:27:42.020]   Mm.
[01:27:42.020 --> 01:27:43.020]   I had 18.
[01:27:43.020 --> 01:27:45.180]   I haven't had the 25, but I've had the 25.
[01:27:45.180 --> 01:27:46.180]   Yeah.
[01:27:46.180 --> 01:27:47.180]   I don't like to drink whiskey.
[01:27:47.180 --> 01:27:49.180]   They don't necessarily get better with age.
[01:27:49.180 --> 01:27:50.180]   I'll be honest.
[01:27:50.180 --> 01:27:51.180]   Is that true?
[01:27:51.180 --> 01:27:52.180]   Okay.
[01:27:52.180 --> 01:27:53.180]   That's good.
[01:27:53.180 --> 01:27:54.180]   Yeah.
[01:27:54.180 --> 01:27:55.180]   I mean, it just depends on the whiskey.
[01:27:55.180 --> 01:27:56.180]   It depends on the whiskey.
[01:27:56.180 --> 01:27:57.180]   And the whiskey in your taste too.
[01:27:57.180 --> 01:28:00.220]   I keep palming bottles of half-drunk whiskey on funnecks.
[01:28:00.220 --> 01:28:01.220]   I don't really...
[01:28:01.220 --> 01:28:02.220]   I don't really...
[01:28:02.220 --> 01:28:03.220]   I don't really like it.
[01:28:03.220 --> 01:28:04.220]   I'm right here.
[01:28:04.220 --> 01:28:07.020]   Oh, I would give it to you if you really weren't.
[01:28:07.020 --> 01:28:08.020]   It's too late.
[01:28:08.020 --> 01:28:10.060]   Are you a whiskey drinker?
[01:28:10.060 --> 01:28:12.260]   I drank both whiskey and shit.
[01:28:12.260 --> 01:28:14.580]   I have some lovely whiskey recommendations.
[01:28:14.580 --> 01:28:15.580]   Should you ever...
[01:28:15.580 --> 01:28:16.580]   Oh, let's...
[01:28:16.580 --> 01:28:17.580]   Okay.
[01:28:17.580 --> 01:28:18.580]   After the change log...
[01:28:18.580 --> 01:28:19.580]   Whiskey time.
[01:28:19.580 --> 01:28:21.220]   Yes.
[01:28:21.220 --> 01:28:24.380]   But you must be 21 to listen to this show.
[01:28:24.380 --> 01:28:25.380]   This is enough.
[01:28:25.380 --> 01:28:26.380]   No, no, stop.
[01:28:26.380 --> 01:28:27.380]   It's not over.
[01:28:27.380 --> 01:28:28.380]   It's not over.
[01:28:28.380 --> 01:28:33.380]   Carstand.
[01:28:33.380 --> 01:28:37.900]   Google Photos adds memories.
[01:28:37.900 --> 01:28:38.980]   I haven't got this yet.
[01:28:38.980 --> 01:28:39.980]   I keep looking for it.
[01:28:39.980 --> 01:28:43.900]   It looks a lot like Instagram stories, little circles at the top of your photos.
[01:28:43.900 --> 01:28:46.060]   Let me check and see if I got it yet.
[01:28:46.060 --> 01:28:47.860]   Last time I checked, I had not.
[01:28:47.860 --> 01:28:54.220]   And the idea is it's memories of your life, year by year from the past.
[01:28:54.220 --> 01:28:57.740]   I would love that because I put everything in Google Photos.
[01:28:57.740 --> 01:28:58.740]   Nope.
[01:28:58.740 --> 01:29:01.740]   I got today, yesterday, Monday.
[01:29:01.740 --> 01:29:02.740]   I don't have memories.
[01:29:02.740 --> 01:29:04.620]   Do I have my phone in my pocket?
[01:29:04.620 --> 01:29:06.580]   Yeah, I wish I had it.
[01:29:06.580 --> 01:29:08.140]   Oh, I have memory.
[01:29:08.140 --> 01:29:09.140]   Oh, you do?
[01:29:09.140 --> 01:29:10.140]   So tell us.
[01:29:10.140 --> 01:29:11.140]   You like it?
[01:29:11.140 --> 01:29:12.140]   Look at it.
[01:29:12.140 --> 01:29:13.140]   I don't know.
[01:29:13.140 --> 01:29:14.140]   We're leaving it about to tap.
[01:29:14.140 --> 01:29:16.740]   It's supposedly has been rolling out to users since the 12th.
[01:29:16.740 --> 01:29:17.740]   I didn't get it.
[01:29:17.740 --> 01:29:19.840]   I have nothing.
[01:29:19.840 --> 01:29:20.840]   These are people.
[01:29:20.840 --> 01:29:23.020]   I have no idea who I'm sitting next to at a conference.
[01:29:23.020 --> 01:29:24.980]   I have zero idea.
[01:29:24.980 --> 01:29:25.980]   You do two main things like that.
[01:29:25.980 --> 01:29:26.980]   They wanted selfies.
[01:29:26.980 --> 01:29:27.980]   They're not going to fly.
[01:29:27.980 --> 01:29:29.980]   Oh, it was very uninspiring.
[01:29:29.980 --> 01:29:31.420]   It was a bunch of smiling faces.
[01:29:31.420 --> 01:29:32.660]   So Google thought, oh, they're happy.
[01:29:32.660 --> 01:29:33.660]   No, it just be.
[01:29:33.660 --> 01:29:37.740]   Oh, it does look for smiles.
[01:29:37.740 --> 01:29:38.740]   Do you have it?
[01:29:38.740 --> 01:29:39.740]   I have nothing.
[01:29:39.740 --> 01:29:40.740]   What are those circles at the top?
[01:29:40.740 --> 01:29:41.740]   Go back down.
[01:29:41.740 --> 01:29:43.740]   No, no, no, scroll down.
[01:29:43.740 --> 01:29:46.180]   Oh, that was just not a notification.
[01:29:46.180 --> 01:29:47.780]   It's just a notification.
[01:29:47.780 --> 01:29:48.780]   Okay.
[01:29:48.780 --> 01:29:55.060]   So photos, you may have seen the notification saying, here's, you know, rediscover this day.
[01:29:55.060 --> 01:29:57.460]   But now they're going to appear as small circles.
[01:29:57.460 --> 01:29:58.460]   They'll be at the top.
[01:29:58.460 --> 01:29:59.460]   Just like Instagram, you tap it.
[01:29:59.460 --> 01:30:03.740]   It'll show a selection of photos or videos you took on that day from previous years,
[01:30:03.740 --> 01:30:09.580]   starting a year ago and going back as far as Google goes with you, which is for me,
[01:30:09.580 --> 01:30:11.580]   2000, 19 years.
[01:30:11.580 --> 01:30:13.140]   Hix.
[01:30:13.140 --> 01:30:15.900]   Mine jumps back further than that, but I think it's just a bug.
[01:30:15.900 --> 01:30:17.420]   Well, I uploaded all.
[01:30:17.420 --> 01:30:20.820]   I mean, Google photos hasn't been around that long, but I uploaded all my photos to it,
[01:30:20.820 --> 01:30:21.820]   basically.
[01:30:21.820 --> 01:30:25.340]   I'm going to go back up thing and on my desktop and just put everything in there because it's
[01:30:25.340 --> 01:30:27.100]   so useful.
[01:30:27.100 --> 01:30:35.900]   Probably a mistake, but Google has a new search feature you might like for the fall season.
[01:30:35.900 --> 01:30:38.300]   Do they still have a fall TV season?
[01:30:38.300 --> 01:30:39.940]   Remember September used to be a big deal.
[01:30:39.940 --> 01:30:40.940]   Do I use?
[01:30:40.940 --> 01:30:42.340]   I had to delay my honeymoon because of that.
[01:30:42.340 --> 01:30:43.980]   The final season of the good place.
[01:30:43.980 --> 01:30:46.460]   That's the final season.
[01:30:46.460 --> 01:30:52.100]   So Jeff is, as many of you know, a former TV guide critic.
[01:30:52.100 --> 01:30:54.700]   You put off your honeymoon because it was the fall.
[01:30:54.700 --> 01:30:56.380]   We got you sweeps, sweeps, sweeps.
[01:30:56.380 --> 01:30:58.820]   Yeah, we got married in the fall and we couldn't go.
[01:30:58.820 --> 01:31:00.340]   So we didn't go until December.
[01:31:00.340 --> 01:31:01.340]   Yeah.
[01:31:01.340 --> 01:31:02.340]   It is what it is.
[01:31:02.340 --> 01:31:05.740]   Oh, I was trying to explain that concept to my daughter because we were watching.
[01:31:05.740 --> 01:31:07.820]   I don't remember what.
[01:31:07.820 --> 01:31:12.460]   But the concept of sweeps week because she was like, why is this episode so over the top?
[01:31:12.460 --> 01:31:16.300]   It's a very special blossom.
[01:31:16.300 --> 01:31:17.300]   Exactly.
[01:31:17.300 --> 01:31:19.340]   But you know what?
[01:31:19.340 --> 01:31:20.340]   It was never a week.
[01:31:20.340 --> 01:31:23.020]   It was always a month where we called it sweeps week.
[01:31:23.020 --> 01:31:26.660]   It's just for those who like your daughter who are fuddled by the term.
[01:31:26.660 --> 01:31:28.820]   It's when the ratings.
[01:31:28.820 --> 01:31:29.820]   So there's all-
[01:31:29.820 --> 01:31:32.060]   They're too expensive to do so you didn't do them all the time.
[01:31:32.060 --> 01:31:34.020]   You did them only in certain months.
[01:31:34.020 --> 01:31:35.020]   Right.
[01:31:35.020 --> 01:31:39.100]   And so that's when you got to get your eyeballs, get them while you can.
[01:31:39.100 --> 01:31:42.420]   My mother sells ads for a TV station.
[01:31:42.420 --> 01:31:43.740]   Oh, so she knows.
[01:31:43.740 --> 01:31:45.460]   So she knows all about sales.
[01:31:45.460 --> 01:31:48.740]   Do you want to come work here?
[01:31:48.740 --> 01:31:50.500]   We're kind of like a little TV station.
[01:31:50.500 --> 01:31:52.820]   Well, you know, we could bring middle arms closer.
[01:31:52.820 --> 01:31:54.620]   You know, it would be nice if I was closer.
[01:31:54.620 --> 01:31:55.620]   There's a moment there.
[01:31:55.620 --> 01:31:57.420]   Do I want my mom here or not?
[01:31:57.420 --> 01:31:58.420]   Yeah.
[01:31:58.420 --> 01:31:59.420]   I'm working.
[01:31:59.420 --> 01:32:00.620]   What are the same office?
[01:32:00.620 --> 01:32:06.900]   So if you search for things on Google, like what to watch, you could shoot.
[01:32:06.900 --> 01:32:07.900]   Well, let's do it.
[01:32:07.900 --> 01:32:08.900]   I want to do it now.
[01:32:08.900 --> 01:32:09.900]   Google.
[01:32:09.900 --> 01:32:10.900]   Oh, is this active?
[01:32:10.900 --> 01:32:11.900]   Does this work?
[01:32:11.900 --> 01:32:12.900]   Well, I don't know.
[01:32:12.900 --> 01:32:14.620]   What to watch?
[01:32:14.620 --> 01:32:17.700]   Because it's going to ask you what do you subscribe to?
[01:32:17.700 --> 01:32:18.700]   No, not yet.
[01:32:18.700 --> 01:32:19.700]   Not yet.
[01:32:19.700 --> 01:32:21.940]   So we got a bunch of stuff that doesn't work yet.
[01:32:21.940 --> 01:32:25.500]   Oh, it's giving me top picks for me and it's asking me to rate things.
[01:32:25.500 --> 01:32:26.500]   There you go.
[01:32:26.500 --> 01:32:27.500]   So you're getting it.
[01:32:27.500 --> 01:32:28.500]   Okay.
[01:32:28.500 --> 01:32:29.500]   I'm getting it.
[01:32:29.500 --> 01:32:30.500]   Yeah.
[01:32:30.500 --> 01:32:32.300]   So it does have some.
[01:32:32.300 --> 01:32:33.300]   Oh, no.
[01:32:33.300 --> 01:32:35.340]   Didn't hit me.
[01:32:35.340 --> 01:32:36.340]   Oh, no.
[01:32:36.340 --> 01:32:38.300]   Did you get that very special blossom?
[01:32:38.300 --> 01:32:40.780]   Yeah, I got the 90210 reboot.
[01:32:40.780 --> 01:32:44.540]   I was like, oh, you know, that's based on your age.
[01:32:44.540 --> 01:32:46.820]   And gender, I think.
[01:32:46.820 --> 01:32:51.100]   It's actually not because I looked up infinity train recently.
[01:32:51.100 --> 01:32:55.500]   And the first thing is like asking me to, oh, it's asking me to rate infinity train,
[01:32:55.500 --> 01:32:56.860]   which I didn't watch on YouTube.
[01:32:56.860 --> 01:32:58.740]   I actually watched somewhere else.
[01:32:58.740 --> 01:32:59.740]   You searched for it.
[01:32:59.740 --> 01:33:01.460]   I did search for sex in the city.
[01:33:01.460 --> 01:33:05.540]   No, no, again, I think that's kind of gender biased.
[01:33:05.540 --> 01:33:08.980]   This is, oh, X two, X been unlimited, United, something.
[01:33:08.980 --> 01:33:09.980]   There you go.
[01:33:09.980 --> 01:33:12.420]   I don't know if I saw that.
[01:33:12.420 --> 01:33:15.500]   So you choose which TV movie subscriptions you already have.
[01:33:15.500 --> 01:33:17.580]   You'll get personal rise recommendations.
[01:33:17.580 --> 01:33:19.220]   You'll see where you can watch them.
[01:33:19.220 --> 01:33:24.020]   If you started in the US, when you search for things like good shows to watch on mobile,
[01:33:24.020 --> 01:33:27.660]   ah, maybe I have to do it on mobile, you could tap.
[01:33:27.660 --> 01:33:32.380]   You could tap the start button in the top picks for your carousel to begin rating shows.
[01:33:32.380 --> 01:33:36.580]   Oh, it's actually doing a good job, you guys.
[01:33:36.580 --> 01:33:38.540]   Oh, it's that Google.
[01:33:38.540 --> 01:33:39.540]   How do they know?
[01:33:39.540 --> 01:33:40.540]   Google.
[01:33:40.540 --> 01:33:41.780]   I've rated a bunch of shows.
[01:33:41.780 --> 01:33:43.980]   And then now it's given me ideas.
[01:33:43.980 --> 01:33:48.260]   And some of them, OK, no, some of them feel stupid like Disney's Aladdin.
[01:33:48.260 --> 01:33:49.260]   That's not going to work.
[01:33:49.260 --> 01:33:50.260]   I got it.
[01:33:50.260 --> 01:33:51.260]   No, they know you have a kid.
[01:33:51.260 --> 01:33:52.260]   See, they know something.
[01:33:52.260 --> 01:33:53.260]   It's definitely got me nailed.
[01:33:53.260 --> 01:33:54.260]   I got nothing new.
[01:33:54.260 --> 01:33:55.260]   It's all like Star Wars and Marvel crap.
[01:33:55.260 --> 01:33:59.860]   OK, yeah, it is working on mobile available to stream recommended for you.
[01:33:59.860 --> 01:34:01.540]   13 reasons why.
[01:34:01.540 --> 01:34:02.540]   No.
[01:34:02.540 --> 01:34:05.860]   Avengers, X men, dark Phoenix it.
[01:34:05.860 --> 01:34:06.860]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:34:06.860 --> 01:34:07.860]   That's not for me.
[01:34:07.860 --> 01:34:09.460]   So here's the top picks for me.
[01:34:09.460 --> 01:34:10.460]   Rate movies and shows.
[01:34:10.460 --> 01:34:12.340]   Yeah, the first the first thing is popular.
[01:34:12.340 --> 01:34:14.700]   It's just popular and the second one better call.
[01:34:14.700 --> 01:34:16.140]   Saul love it.
[01:34:16.140 --> 01:34:17.700]   Patrick Melrose love it.
[01:34:17.700 --> 01:34:19.220]   But it whiplash love it.
[01:34:19.220 --> 01:34:23.860]   The nose I saw these I never saw pixels and I don't think I would like it.
[01:34:23.860 --> 01:34:24.860]   It's got Adam Sandler.
[01:34:24.860 --> 01:34:27.460]   I don't want to see anymore Adam Sandler in my life.
[01:34:27.460 --> 01:34:31.460]   I'm recommending succession even though I don't like that show.
[01:34:31.460 --> 01:34:32.940]   Oh, deadwood.
[01:34:32.940 --> 01:34:33.940]   This is all stuff I want.
[01:34:33.940 --> 01:34:36.260]   It's telling you that it knows better than you, Stacy.
[01:34:36.260 --> 01:34:37.500]   The West Wing L likes it.
[01:34:37.500 --> 01:34:38.500]   You should too.
[01:34:38.500 --> 01:34:40.300]   You know, it's doing pretty well.
[01:34:40.300 --> 01:34:41.980]   I swiped a bunch of swipe rights.
[01:34:41.980 --> 01:34:43.860]   It is a couple of swipe lefts.
[01:34:43.860 --> 01:34:45.780]   OK, new picks coming your way.
[01:34:45.780 --> 01:34:48.340]   Silence your phone and dim the lights.
[01:34:48.340 --> 01:34:49.580]   Really?
[01:34:49.580 --> 01:34:50.900]   So there's popular.
[01:34:50.900 --> 01:34:52.180]   Here's the picks for me.
[01:34:52.180 --> 01:34:53.260]   All the things that you said.
[01:34:53.260 --> 01:34:54.180]   Yes, too.
[01:34:54.180 --> 01:34:59.540]   Oh, no, la la land, the deuce, the leftovers, the righteous gemstones.
[01:34:59.540 --> 01:35:01.380]   Rogue one.
[01:35:01.380 --> 01:35:02.740]   So I guess it's what it's.
[01:35:02.740 --> 01:35:03.620]   I'm a type.
[01:35:03.620 --> 01:35:05.340]   Is that it?
[01:35:05.340 --> 01:35:07.380]   I think it's doing just a recommendation algorithm.
[01:35:07.380 --> 01:35:09.300]   This is, I mean, this is not terrible.
[01:35:09.300 --> 01:35:10.300]   It's kind of cool.
[01:35:10.300 --> 01:35:12.100]   And if you say, oh, well, OK, I want to see Rogue one.
[01:35:12.100 --> 01:35:13.820]   Where can I see it?
[01:35:13.820 --> 01:35:19.420]   It will then show you YouTube as the primary watch option,
[01:35:19.420 --> 01:35:21.140]   but then it shows you other watch options
[01:35:21.140 --> 01:35:22.220]   and how much it costs.
[01:35:22.220 --> 01:35:25.900]   It took me down about eight rows to finally get
[01:35:25.900 --> 01:35:28.860]   to something that I'm like, OK, yeah, that's up my alley.
[01:35:28.860 --> 01:35:30.580]   Well, you need to give Google some more information.
[01:35:30.580 --> 01:35:32.380]   Well, I believe it's feeding up.
[01:35:32.380 --> 01:35:32.980]   More data.
[01:35:32.980 --> 01:35:34.700]   Everybody else in the house.
[01:35:34.700 --> 01:35:35.540]   Yes.
[01:35:35.540 --> 01:35:37.500]   So you see some stuff that others in the house.
[01:35:37.500 --> 01:35:37.940]   Yeah.
[01:35:37.940 --> 01:35:39.500]   Everybody else in the house, this is the stuff
[01:35:39.500 --> 01:35:40.460]   that they would watch.
[01:35:40.460 --> 01:35:41.220]   I wouldn't watch it.
[01:35:41.220 --> 01:35:43.060]   I make them watch what I want to watch.
[01:35:43.060 --> 01:35:44.420]   So it's perfect for me.
[01:35:44.420 --> 01:35:46.580]   I wish I could just leave the room.
[01:35:46.580 --> 01:35:48.500]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:35:48.500 --> 01:35:48.940]   I like it quite--
[01:35:48.940 --> 01:35:50.980]   I wish it would ask me which my favorite show--
[01:35:50.980 --> 01:35:54.260]   because then I think it'd be kind of fun to be like, by the way,
[01:35:54.260 --> 01:35:55.460]   like I love dairy girls.
[01:35:55.460 --> 01:35:56.260]   That's my new--
[01:35:56.260 --> 01:35:59.340]   Well, did you not get the thumbs up, thumbs down?
[01:35:59.340 --> 01:36:02.820]   I did, but it didn't offer me specific shows.
[01:36:02.820 --> 01:36:07.740]   Well, no, so I try to just use the browser search
[01:36:07.740 --> 01:36:08.620]   or say what to watch.
[01:36:08.620 --> 01:36:09.340]   I got nothing.
[01:36:09.340 --> 01:36:11.940]   I have to use the bottom of the phone thing.
[01:36:11.940 --> 01:36:12.460]   Yes.
[01:36:12.460 --> 01:36:13.860]   Apparently, yes, and it's mobile.
[01:36:13.860 --> 01:36:14.820]   Yes.
[01:36:14.820 --> 01:36:15.820]   So that's cool.
[01:36:15.820 --> 01:36:17.100]   That's a fun little thing to play with.
[01:36:17.100 --> 01:36:20.100]   And actually, very, very useful because that has always
[01:36:20.100 --> 01:36:21.780]   been the problem with all these services
[01:36:21.780 --> 01:36:23.860]   is knowing where something is.
[01:36:23.860 --> 01:36:28.300]   I actually used to recommend a site called Can I Stream it?
[01:36:28.300 --> 01:36:29.060]   Yeah, it's a number of that.
[01:36:29.060 --> 01:36:30.740]   Which is canIstream.it.
[01:36:30.740 --> 01:36:32.020]   And it did the same kind of thing.
[01:36:32.020 --> 01:36:32.580]   But this is not--
[01:36:32.580 --> 01:36:33.100]   I don't like that.
[01:36:33.100 --> 01:36:33.860]   Yeah.
[01:36:33.860 --> 01:36:36.580]   This is when you have all three of those things together,
[01:36:36.580 --> 01:36:38.500]   you don't know what's playing where.
[01:36:38.500 --> 01:36:40.300]   Now, here's something I would like to use,
[01:36:40.300 --> 01:36:42.380]   but I'm not completely clear how this works.
[01:36:42.380 --> 01:36:45.580]   Google is going to start highlighting key moments
[01:36:45.580 --> 01:36:49.340]   from videos in search.
[01:36:49.340 --> 01:36:52.220]   So instead of just listing relevant videos when you search,
[01:36:52.220 --> 01:36:54.940]   Google will highlight the most relevant parts of longer
[01:36:54.940 --> 01:36:56.100]   videos.
[01:36:56.100 --> 01:36:59.420]   And this is the part that where I paused based on timestamps
[01:36:59.420 --> 01:37:01.980]   provided by the video creators.
[01:37:01.980 --> 01:37:02.420]   OK.
[01:37:02.420 --> 01:37:03.900]   So I guess--
[01:37:03.900 --> 01:37:06.980]   I mean, this is something for us, we do a lot of video.
[01:37:06.980 --> 01:37:09.500]   Would be really nice if people could search for,
[01:37:09.500 --> 01:37:10.660]   I want to review--
[01:37:10.660 --> 01:37:12.460]   I want the review of the--
[01:37:12.460 --> 01:37:15.380]   Jeff and Stacy screaming about my panic.
[01:37:15.380 --> 01:37:16.940]   More search for moral panic.
[01:37:16.940 --> 01:37:18.460]   And it would take you right there.
[01:37:18.460 --> 01:37:20.180]   That would be really cool.
[01:37:20.180 --> 01:37:22.300]   I was going to ask you would have searched for Stacy's
[01:37:22.300 --> 01:37:23.300]   Si.
[01:37:23.300 --> 01:37:24.300]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:37:24.300 --> 01:37:25.300]   Si.
[01:37:25.300 --> 01:37:29.140]   What's the name of the tool we used to do that in house?
[01:37:29.140 --> 01:37:31.020]   We have a tool we can do--
[01:37:31.020 --> 01:37:32.300]   There's a snipping tool.
[01:37:32.300 --> 01:37:34.580]   And then this feature was also built in
[01:37:34.580 --> 01:37:35.260]   as some other things.
[01:37:35.260 --> 01:37:36.580]   But this is not snipping.
[01:37:36.580 --> 01:37:38.220]   So you do the search-- so here's what the-- look
[01:37:38.220 --> 01:37:39.940]   at the screen here.
[01:37:39.940 --> 01:37:41.380]   So you do the search for something.
[01:37:41.380 --> 01:37:43.260]   And then you see it says in this video,
[01:37:43.260 --> 01:37:44.620]   it has these dots.
[01:37:44.620 --> 01:37:46.020]   And these dots--
[01:37:46.020 --> 01:37:48.300]   so this is podcasting for beginners.
[01:37:48.300 --> 01:37:49.300]   Here's microphones.
[01:37:49.300 --> 01:37:50.460]   It found this.
[01:37:50.460 --> 01:37:52.180]   Boom arm, shock.
[01:37:52.180 --> 01:37:55.020]   So you can jump right to the part you want.
[01:37:55.020 --> 01:37:59.340]   But to make this work, content creators
[01:37:59.340 --> 01:38:02.660]   have to mark up their video with bookmarks.
[01:38:02.660 --> 01:38:06.540]   So we're going to have to figure out how to do that car.
[01:38:06.540 --> 01:38:08.500]   A lot of YouTubers are doing that.
[01:38:08.500 --> 01:38:09.260]   But--
[01:38:09.260 --> 01:38:11.380]   It's using YouTube's engine, I'm sure.
[01:38:11.380 --> 01:38:12.660]   Yeah.
[01:38:12.660 --> 01:38:14.020]   The editors have plenty of time.
[01:38:14.020 --> 01:38:14.500]   They'll--
[01:38:14.500 --> 01:38:15.460]   All right.
[01:38:15.460 --> 01:38:17.460]   We got a new task for you editors.
[01:38:17.460 --> 01:38:18.540]   Mark all the videos.
[01:38:18.540 --> 01:38:20.620]   Now, I started off, and I didn't tell you what YouTube
[01:38:20.620 --> 01:38:21.260]   is shutting down.
[01:38:21.260 --> 01:38:22.380]   It's not that big a deal.
[01:38:22.380 --> 01:38:23.020]   Maybe it is.
[01:38:23.020 --> 01:38:25.820]   It's TV-friendly web interface.
[01:38:25.820 --> 01:38:26.940]   This is kind of a big deal.
[01:38:26.940 --> 01:38:28.940]   This version of YouTube will be going away
[01:38:28.940 --> 01:38:29.440]   soon.
[01:38:29.440 --> 01:38:32.580]   You'll still be able to view YouTube.com.
[01:38:32.580 --> 01:38:34.260]   But you're going to need a supported device
[01:38:34.260 --> 01:38:35.980]   to get the optimized experience.
[01:38:35.980 --> 01:38:37.740]   So it's a lean back interface that
[01:38:37.740 --> 01:38:40.820]   was on a web portal for YouTube.
[01:38:40.820 --> 01:38:42.500]   It's going away soon.
[01:38:42.500 --> 01:38:43.820]   I have no problem with that.
[01:38:43.820 --> 01:38:44.820]   There's plenty of devices.
[01:38:44.820 --> 01:38:46.220]   Was that when you Chromecast it?
[01:38:46.220 --> 01:38:47.660]   No, look.
[01:38:47.660 --> 01:38:49.260]   So I'm on YouTube now.
[01:38:49.260 --> 01:38:50.700]   And by the way, this is the thing.
[01:38:50.700 --> 01:38:51.820]   It's going away.
[01:38:51.820 --> 01:38:53.300]   But you see this different interface?
[01:38:53.300 --> 01:38:55.180]   This is kind of like what you would see
[01:38:55.180 --> 01:38:58.620]   if you were using a set top box, a Roku or something
[01:38:58.620 --> 01:38:59.940]   like that.
[01:38:59.940 --> 01:39:05.220]   So if you were using the browser on one of those boxes.
[01:39:05.220 --> 01:39:06.780]   Because now, this is like--
[01:39:06.780 --> 01:39:10.380]   so Android TV has this interface, right?
[01:39:10.380 --> 01:39:13.380]   So this is a lean back TV experience
[01:39:13.380 --> 01:39:17.260]   for a browser on a computer.
[01:39:17.260 --> 01:39:19.100]   But it's going away.
[01:39:19.100 --> 01:39:20.180]   Did you use this cursor?
[01:39:20.180 --> 01:39:22.660]   I bet it'll-- you know I bet it uses it a lot of kids use it
[01:39:22.660 --> 01:39:24.380]   like teenagers and stuff.
[01:39:24.380 --> 01:39:29.660]   I don't use it because I use the YouTube app rather than
[01:39:29.660 --> 01:39:30.900]   the YouTube web.
[01:39:30.900 --> 01:39:31.340]   Right.
[01:39:31.340 --> 01:39:33.380]   And you'll get something similar to this.
[01:39:33.380 --> 01:39:36.100]   But this is pretty cool if you're just using a web browser.
[01:39:36.100 --> 01:39:38.500]   My kids used to just put YouTube up on the TV
[01:39:38.500 --> 01:39:41.140]   and just segue from song to song.
[01:39:41.140 --> 01:39:41.900]   I used to do that.
[01:39:41.900 --> 01:39:44.340]   But the apps are so much better.
[01:39:44.340 --> 01:39:44.860]   Better.
[01:39:44.860 --> 01:39:45.420]   There's so much better.
[01:39:45.420 --> 01:39:48.300]   My kid never watches TV on the TV.
[01:39:48.300 --> 01:39:50.900]   She only watches it on her computer or a tablet.
[01:39:50.900 --> 01:39:52.300]   That's pretty much a feature.
[01:39:52.300 --> 01:39:53.700]   That's actually true.
[01:39:53.700 --> 01:39:54.200]   Yeah.
[01:39:54.200 --> 01:39:56.140]   YouTube doesn't spend a lot of time on my TV.
[01:39:56.140 --> 01:39:57.220]   Well, they know that.
[01:39:57.220 --> 01:40:00.020]   That's why they're shutting this down.
[01:40:00.020 --> 01:40:02.020]   Which is kind of-- I mean, you know how we were talking
[01:40:02.020 --> 01:40:03.140]   about cameras going away?
[01:40:03.140 --> 01:40:04.860]   Do TVs eventually go away?
[01:40:04.860 --> 01:40:06.500]   We only have one in our whole house.
[01:40:06.500 --> 01:40:09.700]   Not from my cold, dead hands.
[01:40:09.700 --> 01:40:10.300]   Oh, it's four.
[01:40:10.300 --> 01:40:11.300]   I forgot about sports.
[01:40:11.300 --> 01:40:13.940]   I spend no time on my TV.
[01:40:13.940 --> 01:40:16.060]   I'm always watching-- we have five TVs
[01:40:16.060 --> 01:40:17.540]   and there's only three people.
[01:40:17.540 --> 01:40:21.060]   I'm always watching Plex or college football or something.
[01:40:21.060 --> 01:40:23.740]   So I need my television.
[01:40:23.740 --> 01:40:24.660]   I like TV.
[01:40:24.660 --> 01:40:25.660]   Plex is a sponsor.
[01:40:25.660 --> 01:40:26.700]   I like to watch.
[01:40:26.700 --> 01:40:28.860]   Yes, Plex.
[01:40:28.860 --> 01:40:32.980]   Google has an addiction website.
[01:40:32.980 --> 01:40:33.660]   It's called a record.
[01:40:33.660 --> 01:40:34.900]   It's pretty good.
[01:40:34.900 --> 01:40:40.020]   It is fighting one issue, which is bad addiction content.
[01:40:40.020 --> 01:40:42.700]   That's a good way for people to handle that, isn't it?
[01:40:42.700 --> 01:40:43.220]   Exactly.
[01:40:43.220 --> 01:40:44.940]   I'm an addition to have a vaccine website.
[01:40:44.940 --> 01:40:45.900]   Exactly.
[01:40:45.900 --> 01:40:47.980]   Which is where I think they're all going to have.
[01:40:47.980 --> 01:40:49.420]   A round Earth website.
[01:40:49.420 --> 01:40:51.780]   A round Earth website.
[01:40:51.780 --> 01:40:54.900]   For those of us who still believe.
[01:40:54.900 --> 01:40:56.940]   So this is called Recover Together.
[01:40:56.940 --> 01:41:01.580]   It's at recovertogether.withgoogle.com.
[01:41:01.580 --> 01:41:06.180]   And it's for National Recovery Month, which is September.
[01:41:06.180 --> 01:41:08.420]   There's lots of information here.
[01:41:08.420 --> 01:41:10.300]   This will be a lot better than searching for it.
[01:41:10.300 --> 01:41:12.060]   That's the theory, right?
[01:41:12.060 --> 01:41:14.420]   Now, if I search for recovery, I would presume
[01:41:14.420 --> 01:41:15.860]   Google puts us at the top.
[01:41:15.860 --> 01:41:18.580]   Although that's a hot button right now
[01:41:18.580 --> 01:41:20.500]   for regulators.
[01:41:20.500 --> 01:41:21.780]   Oh, yeah.
[01:41:21.780 --> 01:41:24.820]   What if I search for something like AA?
[01:41:24.820 --> 01:41:25.980]   Go ahead.
[01:41:25.980 --> 01:41:29.020]   Is it all recovery or is it just--
[01:41:29.020 --> 01:41:30.660]   Let's see.
[01:41:30.660 --> 01:41:33.100]   Oh, I get American Airlines.
[01:41:33.100 --> 01:41:34.860]   That's exactly what I got.
[01:41:34.860 --> 01:41:36.660]   And you might want to know what I'm saying.
[01:41:36.660 --> 01:41:37.700]   You've got a knowledge--
[01:41:37.700 --> 01:41:39.020]   look, you've got a knowledge graph card
[01:41:39.020 --> 01:41:40.620]   on the right for alcohol economists.
[01:41:40.620 --> 01:41:42.140]   AA was the second entry.
[01:41:42.140 --> 01:41:43.420]   Go ahead.
[01:41:43.420 --> 01:41:45.460]   OK, see mine was AA.
[01:41:45.460 --> 01:41:49.460]   And then, oh, now, so alcoholism, knowledge card,
[01:41:49.460 --> 01:41:54.100]   mental disorder, does that get me there?
[01:41:54.100 --> 01:41:54.780]   Well, you're right.
[01:41:54.780 --> 01:41:56.140]   I just searched for heroin addiction,
[01:41:56.140 --> 01:41:57.580]   and I'm not getting it.
[01:41:57.580 --> 01:41:58.660]   So interesting.
[01:41:58.660 --> 01:42:01.260]   Maybe you just have to search for Recover Together.
[01:42:01.260 --> 01:42:02.780]   I don't know.
[01:42:02.780 --> 01:42:05.460]   This is a really nice site.
[01:42:05.460 --> 01:42:07.620]   I think they've done a very nice job on this.
[01:42:07.620 --> 01:42:08.140]   And I would--
[01:42:08.140 --> 01:42:09.140]   How do I get to it?
[01:42:09.140 --> 01:42:10.140]   Yeah.
[01:42:10.140 --> 01:42:12.140]   Recover Together.withgoogle.com.
[01:42:12.140 --> 01:42:13.300]   Not the greatest--
[01:42:13.300 --> 01:42:14.180]   even that I didn't get it.
[01:42:14.180 --> 01:42:15.100]   I searched for--
[01:42:15.100 --> 01:42:16.500]   I got joined groups.
[01:42:16.500 --> 01:42:20.020]   That's really weird.
[01:42:20.020 --> 01:42:22.140]   Because that's kind of an important thing, right?
[01:42:22.140 --> 01:42:22.660]   Yeah.
[01:42:22.660 --> 01:42:23.580]   Yeah, I'd be able to get it.
[01:42:23.580 --> 01:42:25.020]   Is it the Recovery Village?
[01:42:25.020 --> 01:42:25.980]   Nope.
[01:42:25.980 --> 01:42:27.580]   Recover Together with Google.
[01:42:27.580 --> 01:42:29.260]   Recover together.withgoogle.com.
[01:42:29.260 --> 01:42:30.060]   Is that it?
[01:42:30.060 --> 01:42:30.580]   No.
[01:42:30.580 --> 01:42:31.100]   No.
[01:42:31.100 --> 01:42:32.180]   No, that's not really--
[01:42:32.180 --> 01:42:35.300]   I got it about four entries down on my screen.
[01:42:35.300 --> 01:42:35.900]   When I was in the session.
[01:42:35.900 --> 01:42:38.700]   I asked if I was an alcoholic, and it told me
[01:42:38.700 --> 01:42:40.700]   I still haven't found it.
[01:42:40.700 --> 01:42:42.460]   Oh, the ads you're going to get now, Stacey?
[01:42:42.460 --> 01:42:46.580]   So here's a way to know if Google thinks you're a drunk.
[01:42:46.580 --> 01:42:48.460]   It's the number third search result for me.
[01:42:48.460 --> 01:42:52.380]   And I'm sure I don't really want to be--
[01:42:52.380 --> 01:42:54.580]   Think about how often I'm searching cocktails, you guys.
[01:42:54.580 --> 01:42:55.820]   I mean, I--
[01:42:55.820 --> 01:42:57.660]   Yeah, I searched addiction recovery,
[01:42:57.660 --> 01:43:00.980]   and it's not on the front page of my phone.
[01:43:00.980 --> 01:43:01.740]   This is weird.
[01:43:01.740 --> 01:43:02.660]   At all.
[01:43:02.660 --> 01:43:03.900]   Yeah, mine isn't coming up--
[01:43:03.900 --> 01:43:05.540]   Another slow rollout.
[01:43:05.540 --> 01:43:07.340]   Another slow rollout, possibly.
[01:43:07.340 --> 01:43:10.180]   Well, but it defeats what we were assuming
[01:43:10.180 --> 01:43:13.660]   is the purpose of this, which is to give somewhere
[01:43:13.660 --> 01:43:15.580]   that Google can send people better
[01:43:15.580 --> 01:43:20.340]   than this generalized search results.
[01:43:20.340 --> 01:43:21.340]   Yeah, isn't that funny?
[01:43:21.340 --> 01:43:22.660]   OK, I searched heroin addict.
[01:43:22.660 --> 01:43:23.500]   And I still don't have--
[01:43:23.500 --> 01:43:24.020]   I still don't have--
[01:43:24.020 --> 01:43:27.220]   I'm still surfacing their own internal projects for things.
[01:43:27.220 --> 01:43:27.700]   That's funny.
[01:43:27.700 --> 01:43:29.220]   They should show this to the EU.
[01:43:29.220 --> 01:43:32.820]   Actually, maybe that's the secret purpose for this.
[01:43:32.820 --> 01:43:33.340]   See?
[01:43:33.340 --> 01:43:33.820]   We don't--
[01:43:33.820 --> 01:43:34.820]   We don't--
[01:43:34.820 --> 01:43:35.820]   We don't--
[01:43:35.820 --> 01:43:36.660]   We don't help ourselves.
[01:43:36.660 --> 01:43:38.060]   It's a nice thing, but we can't show it to anybody.
[01:43:38.060 --> 01:43:40.540]   Because you all let us.
[01:43:40.540 --> 01:43:43.660]   Google begins rolling out new features
[01:43:43.660 --> 01:43:48.820]   for its family link parental control.
[01:43:48.820 --> 01:43:51.620]   I don't-- do you use this, Stacey?
[01:43:51.620 --> 01:43:53.300]   No, my daughter turned 13 this year.
[01:43:53.300 --> 01:43:56.180]   She's out of the parental control--
[01:43:56.180 --> 01:43:57.980]   Push her out of the nest.
[01:43:57.980 --> 01:44:01.060]   She can see all the garbage she wants.
[01:44:01.060 --> 01:44:04.020]   So this comes built into Android devices
[01:44:04.020 --> 01:44:06.380]   with Android 10 and up.
[01:44:06.380 --> 01:44:09.780]   And it also can be downloaded as a standalone app from Google
[01:44:09.780 --> 01:44:10.660]   Play if you don't have it.
[01:44:10.660 --> 01:44:12.980]   It's called Family Link.
[01:44:12.980 --> 01:44:15.460]   But it's nice that it's built into the OS now.
[01:44:15.460 --> 01:44:16.060]   Native.
[01:44:16.060 --> 01:44:18.940]   You could set device bedtimes, track activity, perhaps,
[01:44:18.940 --> 01:44:22.820]   set daily limits, view the device's location on the map,
[01:44:22.820 --> 01:44:27.020]   ring it, and more.
[01:44:27.020 --> 01:44:27.660]   Oh, you know what?
[01:44:27.660 --> 01:44:29.740]   I should actually set this up because my daughter's
[01:44:29.740 --> 01:44:30.980]   now on an Android phone again.
[01:44:30.980 --> 01:44:32.500]   There you go.
[01:44:32.500 --> 01:44:33.500]   How's she going to--
[01:44:33.500 --> 01:44:35.100]   Oh, she's working, by the way.
[01:44:35.100 --> 01:44:38.700]   I don't think she's figured out how to charge it yet.
[01:44:38.700 --> 01:44:39.340]   I'm not kidding.
[01:44:39.340 --> 01:44:42.140]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:44:42.140 --> 01:44:44.980]   I'm just like, OK.
[01:44:44.980 --> 01:44:46.180]   OK.
[01:44:46.180 --> 01:44:47.900]   How do you charge this?
[01:44:47.900 --> 01:44:49.900]   This is one port.
[01:44:49.900 --> 01:44:51.140]   I love this feature.
[01:44:51.140 --> 01:44:54.100]   And I want to see this in a lot of parental control stuff.
[01:44:54.100 --> 01:44:56.220]   It's called bonus time.
[01:44:56.220 --> 01:45:01.340]   So if your kid does her chores, add some bonus time.
[01:45:01.340 --> 01:45:03.300]   The phone normally would lock at 9.
[01:45:03.300 --> 01:45:05.900]   That's disgusting.
[01:45:05.900 --> 01:45:07.940]   I don't want to--
[01:45:07.940 --> 01:45:08.460]   come on.
[01:45:08.460 --> 01:45:10.820]   You're like, bribing your kid with screen time.
[01:45:10.820 --> 01:45:12.980]   Well, don't make it chores then.
[01:45:12.980 --> 01:45:13.900]   I agree.
[01:45:13.900 --> 01:45:16.980]   Make it-- she ate all her peas.
[01:45:16.980 --> 01:45:20.020]   OK, again, bribing your kids with screen time
[01:45:20.020 --> 01:45:21.100]   for doing something--
[01:45:21.100 --> 01:45:23.220]   You don't ever bribe your kid?
[01:45:23.220 --> 01:45:23.780]   Oh, no.
[01:45:23.780 --> 01:45:25.700]   I have a really exceptional kid, and not
[01:45:25.700 --> 01:45:28.900]   like a parent braggy way.
[01:45:28.900 --> 01:45:32.500]   I bribed her once, and she went along with it for the bribe.
[01:45:32.500 --> 01:45:34.460]   And then after she got the reward,
[01:45:34.460 --> 01:45:38.140]   she asked me if I would take the bribe away if she reverted
[01:45:38.140 --> 01:45:39.140]   back to form.
[01:45:39.140 --> 01:45:40.740]   And then she-- I said, no, of course not.
[01:45:40.740 --> 01:45:41.220]   You earned it.
[01:45:41.220 --> 01:45:42.180]   And she's like, OK.
[01:45:42.180 --> 01:45:45.660]   And then she reverted back to form, of course.
[01:45:45.660 --> 01:45:47.540]   She was five.
[01:45:47.540 --> 01:45:48.820]   That's totally good, though.
[01:45:48.820 --> 01:45:50.780]   The last time I bribed her.
[01:45:50.780 --> 01:45:51.820]   I totally get it, though, with--
[01:45:51.820 --> 01:45:53.700]   You bribed Isaiah and Jacob?
[01:45:53.700 --> 01:45:55.300]   No, I encouraged them.
[01:45:55.300 --> 01:45:55.820]   Oh.
[01:45:55.820 --> 01:45:57.740]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:45:57.740 --> 01:46:01.380]   He believes in the stick, not the carrot.
[01:46:01.380 --> 01:46:06.500]   The audio listeners are missing out on Liz.
[01:46:06.500 --> 01:46:07.700]   It's just all I need to say--
[01:46:07.700 --> 01:46:09.140]   stick, no carrot.
[01:46:09.140 --> 01:46:10.620]   All stick, no carrot.
[01:46:10.620 --> 01:46:13.900]   That's Aunt's parenting.
[01:46:13.900 --> 01:46:15.220]   That's parenting 101.
[01:46:15.220 --> 01:46:16.620]   You don't hate kids, do you?
[01:46:16.620 --> 01:46:19.020]   Not anymore.
[01:46:19.020 --> 01:46:21.620]   You're not a k-leg-y boy.
[01:46:21.620 --> 01:46:22.180]   Allegedly.
[01:46:22.180 --> 01:46:24.580]   No, you actually-- but you're boys, whatever you're doing,
[01:46:24.580 --> 01:46:26.460]   you're doing it right, because they're very sweet.
[01:46:26.460 --> 01:46:27.260]   Thank you, boys.
[01:46:27.260 --> 01:46:29.140]   Although you tell me that's not actually--
[01:46:29.140 --> 01:46:30.580]   they got you fooled how they are.
[01:46:30.580 --> 01:46:32.500]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:46:32.500 --> 01:46:36.180]   All right.
[01:46:36.180 --> 01:46:37.820]   But I totally get it.
[01:46:37.820 --> 01:46:42.180]   I don't want to encourage more screen time.
[01:46:42.180 --> 01:46:45.060]   I think that's a big problem with the most kids today,
[01:46:45.060 --> 01:46:48.220]   anyway, is everybody sort of walking around,
[01:46:48.220 --> 01:46:50.300]   staring at a screen, and not necessarily
[01:46:50.300 --> 01:46:53.140]   taking advantage of the stuff going on around them,
[01:46:53.140 --> 01:46:57.140]   walking into polls, walking into the streets accidentally.
[01:46:57.140 --> 01:46:57.640]   You know?
[01:46:57.640 --> 01:46:59.020]   As low as they're not walking in front of me,
[01:46:59.020 --> 01:46:59.860]   I have no objection.
[01:46:59.860 --> 01:47:01.260]   That's when I have a problem.
[01:47:01.260 --> 01:47:02.740]   Out of my way.
[01:47:02.740 --> 01:47:05.220]   You know, I was coming down today into the path train,
[01:47:05.220 --> 01:47:07.180]   and there's a narrow staircase down.
[01:47:07.180 --> 01:47:09.060]   People were trying to-- there's a train right there.
[01:47:09.060 --> 01:47:09.820]   I could make the train.
[01:47:09.820 --> 01:47:11.180]   People were saying I could make the train.
[01:47:11.180 --> 01:47:13.480]   And there's some guy on the stairs
[01:47:13.480 --> 01:47:14.620]   tweeting and going slowly.
[01:47:14.620 --> 01:47:17.460]   I mean, Jesus, can't you just walk four steps and get down?
[01:47:17.460 --> 01:47:18.260]   So annoying.
[01:47:18.260 --> 01:47:19.220]   I did it, isn't annoying.
[01:47:19.220 --> 01:47:20.220]   The problem is the technology.
[01:47:20.220 --> 01:47:22.180]   The problem is that guy's rude.
[01:47:22.180 --> 01:47:22.820]   You know what?
[01:47:22.820 --> 01:47:24.040]   Yes, entitled.
[01:47:24.040 --> 01:47:26.020]   Although, I think technology does make--
[01:47:26.020 --> 01:47:28.280]   it does encourage people to live in their own worlds
[01:47:28.280 --> 01:47:32.120]   and not feel more entitled than being part of the world
[01:47:32.120 --> 01:47:33.120]   around them.
[01:47:33.120 --> 01:47:34.400]   Well, if they're on Facebook, they're actually
[01:47:34.400 --> 01:47:36.880]   communicating with other people.
[01:47:36.880 --> 01:47:38.240]   [BUZZER]
[01:47:38.240 --> 01:47:38.740]   OK.
[01:47:38.740 --> 01:47:40.080]   Allegedly.
[01:47:40.080 --> 01:47:41.800]   Other Russian sock puppets.
[01:47:41.800 --> 01:47:42.640]   Butts.
[01:47:42.640 --> 01:47:43.320]   And that's--
[01:47:43.320 --> 01:47:47.680]   I will say you guys, I ran into a poll, not on my phone.
[01:47:47.680 --> 01:47:49.880]   While I was looking at my purse to make sure I didn't leave it
[01:47:49.880 --> 01:47:51.920]   in a cab, and I literally walked into a poll.
[01:47:51.920 --> 01:47:53.720]   And it was the most embarrassing--
[01:47:53.720 --> 01:47:56.180]   You were in Leipzig when you ran into this poll.
[01:47:56.180 --> 01:47:59.100]   [LAUGHING]
[01:47:59.100 --> 01:48:00.780]   That's the Google change log.
[01:48:00.780 --> 01:48:03.260]   [BUZZER]
[01:48:03.260 --> 01:48:04.500]   OK, a couple more stories, and we're
[01:48:04.500 --> 01:48:08.060]   going to take a break, then we're going to get some whiskey.
[01:48:08.060 --> 01:48:12.900]   Jeff Jarvis, what would the world look like if this has--
[01:48:12.900 --> 01:48:15.420]   This has a really long post.
[01:48:15.420 --> 01:48:16.740]   So we may not want to do this.
[01:48:16.740 --> 01:48:20.340]   Pessimists win.
[01:48:20.340 --> 01:48:20.820]   You know, I--
[01:48:20.820 --> 01:48:22.100]   You're calling me a pessimist?
[01:48:22.100 --> 01:48:24.300]   OK, so I read in the New York--
[01:48:24.300 --> 01:48:24.920]   I actually just--
[01:48:24.920 --> 01:48:25.860]   dystopian.
[01:48:25.860 --> 01:48:29.900]   Jonathan Franzen, did you read his New Yorker piece?
[01:48:29.900 --> 01:48:32.960]   He said, it's time for us to acknowledge the fact
[01:48:32.960 --> 01:48:35.540]   that we're going to lose on climate change,
[01:48:35.540 --> 01:48:38.780]   that what needs to be done needs to be done so quickly.
[01:48:38.780 --> 01:48:42.300]   And with such unanimity, there isn't a hope in hell
[01:48:42.300 --> 01:48:46.560]   that we are going to avoid even the worst consequences
[01:48:46.560 --> 01:48:47.620]   of climate change.
[01:48:47.620 --> 01:48:49.380]   So the wise thing--
[01:48:49.380 --> 01:48:50.740]   which I think is dystopian.
[01:48:50.740 --> 01:48:54.660]   The wise thing to do would be just prepare for it.
[01:48:54.660 --> 01:48:55.380]   I in fact have you--
[01:48:55.380 --> 01:48:56.660]   Move away from coast.
[01:48:56.660 --> 01:48:57.160]   Yes.
[01:48:57.160 --> 01:48:59.460]   --whether control technology.
[01:48:59.460 --> 01:49:02.700]   I honestly, as a technologist, still
[01:49:02.700 --> 01:49:05.700]   think that there's going to be a kind of a Deus Ex Machina,
[01:49:05.700 --> 01:49:08.060]   that somebody is going to invent--
[01:49:08.060 --> 01:49:09.260]   Carbon sucking.
[01:49:09.260 --> 01:49:11.220]   Carbon sequestering technology, they're
[01:49:11.220 --> 01:49:12.620]   going to put it and it's going to--
[01:49:12.620 --> 01:49:14.220]   and everything's going to be fine.
[01:49:14.220 --> 01:49:18.060]   And it will make auto fuel.
[01:49:18.060 --> 01:49:19.420]   And everything's going to be fine.
[01:49:19.420 --> 01:49:20.660]   I heard they're working on it.
[01:49:20.660 --> 01:49:21.780]   And I did get two books.
[01:49:21.780 --> 01:49:24.420]   One I really-- actually, I haven't read the second one,
[01:49:24.420 --> 01:49:26.380]   so I won't recommend it, but it looks good.
[01:49:26.380 --> 01:49:29.100]   One called the sixth extinction.
[01:49:29.100 --> 01:49:31.340]   There have been five massive extinction events
[01:49:31.340 --> 01:49:32.300]   in the history of the world.
[01:49:32.300 --> 01:49:33.180]   And it's authoring.
[01:49:33.180 --> 01:49:37.060]   One Pulitzer Prize says, we are about to enter the sixth.
[01:49:37.060 --> 01:49:38.860]   And it's very well written.
[01:49:38.860 --> 01:49:40.100]   It's actually not dystopian.
[01:49:40.100 --> 01:49:44.500]   It's kind of jolly, but the outcome is not good for us.
[01:49:44.500 --> 01:49:46.940]   And then I just got another one too, which I want to read.
[01:49:46.940 --> 01:49:48.580]   Because I'm just going to figure, well, OK,
[01:49:48.580 --> 01:49:50.460]   maybe Franzen's right.
[01:49:50.460 --> 01:49:54.100]   It's hard to see that every nation in the world
[01:49:54.100 --> 01:49:56.780]   is going to go to zero emissions by 2030.
[01:49:56.780 --> 01:50:00.060]   Doesn't seem that likely.
[01:50:00.060 --> 01:50:01.500]   Then we're going to give up air travel.
[01:50:01.500 --> 01:50:05.220]   Then we're going to give up gas cars that we're going to--
[01:50:05.220 --> 01:50:07.420]   I mean, it just doesn't seem that likely.
[01:50:07.420 --> 01:50:10.140]   Especially since the US government just told California,
[01:50:10.140 --> 01:50:13.420]   we can't have higher emission standards than their crappy
[01:50:13.420 --> 01:50:14.620]   emission standards.
[01:50:14.620 --> 01:50:16.020]   It just doesn't seem that likely.
[01:50:16.020 --> 01:50:19.340]   So is that an example, Jeff, of dystopian?
[01:50:19.340 --> 01:50:19.860]   No.
[01:50:19.860 --> 01:50:21.780]   By the way, I'm looking at a Vox story that
[01:50:21.780 --> 01:50:24.660]   says that just the way we're on Franzen, the headline says,
[01:50:24.660 --> 01:50:27.140]   scientists are pissed at the novelist and the New Yorker
[01:50:27.140 --> 01:50:28.420]   from publishing him.
[01:50:28.420 --> 01:50:29.660]   I thought it was quite good.
[01:50:29.660 --> 01:50:34.700]   I mean, he says, it's time to take our head out of the sand.
[01:50:34.700 --> 01:50:35.300]   Anyway, really--
[01:50:35.300 --> 01:50:37.860]   I immediately asked for the essay went live Sunday.
[01:50:37.860 --> 01:50:40.340]   People began to express their ire online.
[01:50:40.340 --> 01:50:42.100]   Climate scientists and activists were especially
[01:50:42.100 --> 01:50:44.780]   pissed at the author and also at the magazine that published
[01:50:44.780 --> 01:50:45.780]   them.
[01:50:45.780 --> 01:50:48.260]   The critics angers him to coalesce around four main complaints,
[01:50:48.260 --> 01:50:49.780]   three of them empirical in nature.
[01:50:49.780 --> 01:50:52.300]   Franzen is wrong on the science, on the politics,
[01:50:52.300 --> 01:50:53.860]   and on the psychology of human behavior
[01:50:53.860 --> 01:50:55.940]   as it pertains to climate change.
[01:50:55.940 --> 01:50:57.740]   The fourth complaint was more about credentials
[01:50:57.740 --> 01:50:58.900]   and identity.
[01:50:58.900 --> 01:51:00.500]   For prestigious magazines in the New Yorker
[01:51:00.500 --> 01:51:02.060]   wants to allocate-- yeah, exactly.
[01:51:02.060 --> 01:51:03.780]   And boring one with that, I would argue.
[01:51:03.780 --> 01:51:04.980]   Oh, I love his books.
[01:51:04.980 --> 01:51:05.900]   But OK.
[01:51:05.900 --> 01:51:09.500]   I gave a great review to an early one about St. Louis.
[01:51:09.500 --> 01:51:12.260]   I was reading the corrections on 9/11.
[01:51:12.260 --> 01:51:14.300]   Oh, so you have a bad test in your mouth from that?
[01:51:14.300 --> 01:51:16.820]   It was-- well, no, it was this.
[01:51:16.820 --> 01:51:19.900]   The copy I had was literally filled on every page with the dust.
[01:51:19.900 --> 01:51:20.660]   Oh, my God.
[01:51:20.660 --> 01:51:22.300]   I actually loved the corrections.
[01:51:22.300 --> 01:51:23.980]   But it's slice of life fiction.
[01:51:23.980 --> 01:51:25.180]   It's not for everyone.
[01:51:25.180 --> 01:51:26.900]   It's-- well, the problem is nothing happens.
[01:51:26.900 --> 01:51:29.020]   After 9/11, it just seems so self-indulgent.
[01:51:29.020 --> 01:51:30.420]   It does seem self-indulgent.
[01:51:30.420 --> 01:51:31.180]   But that's human.
[01:51:31.180 --> 01:51:33.180]   That's human.
[01:51:33.180 --> 01:51:35.740]   But no, that's not my view of dystopia.
[01:51:35.740 --> 01:51:38.020]   Oh, when it's your view of dystopia
[01:51:38.020 --> 01:51:40.780]   is that all you guys are keep on complaining
[01:51:40.780 --> 01:51:43.660]   about everything technology win.
[01:51:43.660 --> 01:51:44.940]   That would be bad.
[01:51:44.940 --> 01:51:46.420]   That would be bad.
[01:51:46.420 --> 01:51:49.740]   And that the-- what I call the unholy compromise
[01:51:49.740 --> 01:51:53.220]   of the year 2022 happens, and Trump is conservative,
[01:51:53.220 --> 01:51:54.980]   is a more night liberal's joint forces
[01:51:54.980 --> 01:51:56.500]   to attack the internet companies,
[01:51:56.500 --> 01:51:58.700]   with each of their own reasons.
[01:51:58.700 --> 01:52:01.020]   And in the aftermath, most of the internet companies
[01:52:01.020 --> 01:52:03.220]   are broken up.
[01:52:03.220 --> 01:52:05.060]   Collection use of data by commercial entities
[01:52:05.060 --> 01:52:07.980]   as well as academic research is severely curtailed.
[01:52:07.980 --> 01:52:10.180]   Moderation requirements and consequent liability
[01:52:10.180 --> 01:52:12.740]   for copyright violations, hate, falsehood,
[01:52:12.740 --> 01:52:15.180]   unauthorized memories and other forbidden speech
[01:52:15.180 --> 01:52:17.420]   were imposed on social media companies,
[01:52:17.420 --> 01:52:21.180]   and then on news organizations and media organizations.
[01:52:21.180 --> 01:52:24.220]   New speech courts were established
[01:52:24.220 --> 01:52:26.780]   to adjudicate disputes of falsehood and hate
[01:52:26.780 --> 01:52:29.820]   as well as information ownership, excessive expression,
[01:52:29.820 --> 01:52:32.420]   and political neutrality by net companies.
[01:52:32.420 --> 01:52:37.980]   This is if all of the calls for regulation of big tech
[01:52:37.980 --> 01:52:40.820]   go so far as it's going to really break it all up.
[01:52:40.820 --> 01:52:44.140]   Because I think what we talk about here is not--
[01:52:44.140 --> 01:52:46.340]   in fact, I think we've often said probably not
[01:52:46.340 --> 01:52:47.540]   a good idea of break up big tech,
[01:52:47.540 --> 01:52:50.580]   but certainly that some regulation is in order.
[01:52:50.580 --> 01:52:52.860]   So I went to the limit on all of the--
[01:52:52.860 --> 01:52:53.860]   Yeah, but what if--
[01:52:53.860 --> 01:52:55.300]   And that's always been my concern too,
[01:52:55.300 --> 01:52:56.540]   is you start talking about this.
[01:52:56.540 --> 01:52:57.900]   If you go all the way down that road,
[01:52:57.900 --> 01:53:00.700]   then you lose all the benefits of technology.
[01:53:00.700 --> 01:53:01.580]   Precisely.
[01:53:01.580 --> 01:53:03.860]   So what happens when we demonize data?
[01:53:03.860 --> 01:53:07.180]   What happens when we fight over data ownership?
[01:53:07.180 --> 01:53:08.820]   Good to be.
[01:53:08.820 --> 01:53:11.580]   I propose that there's going to be a law here that says
[01:53:11.580 --> 01:53:15.220]   that you have to do what I call technology impact reports
[01:53:15.220 --> 01:53:17.460]   that list everything that could possibly go wrong
[01:53:17.460 --> 01:53:19.380]   with the technology that you introduce.
[01:53:19.380 --> 01:53:22.580]   If you don't list it and it happens, then you have liability.
[01:53:22.580 --> 01:53:23.380]   I look at--
[01:53:23.380 --> 01:53:25.140]   I think you should do that internally
[01:53:25.140 --> 01:53:27.340]   before they release a product, actually.
[01:53:27.340 --> 01:53:28.180]   Yeah, I've actually showed.
[01:53:28.180 --> 01:53:28.660]   I don't know--
[01:53:28.660 --> 01:53:30.420]   In this case, it was about what?
[01:53:30.420 --> 01:53:31.220]   Well, but they're not.
[01:53:31.220 --> 01:53:32.900]   So bidding technologies, we had a discussion today
[01:53:32.900 --> 01:53:34.340]   about facial recognition.
[01:53:34.340 --> 01:53:38.500]   I argue here that it's outlawed.
[01:53:38.500 --> 01:53:40.700]   That we have the beginnings of laws
[01:53:40.700 --> 01:53:42.700]   that try to establish truth versus falsity.
[01:53:42.700 --> 01:53:46.980]   That's already happening in France and Singapore.
[01:53:46.980 --> 01:53:48.540]   We get to the idea--
[01:53:48.540 --> 01:53:50.300]   there's a lot of argument going on today
[01:53:50.300 --> 01:53:53.740]   that we have too much speech, which scares me to death.
[01:53:53.740 --> 01:53:56.100]   But expected academics are asking
[01:53:56.100 --> 01:53:57.740]   whether the First Amendment is obsolete,
[01:53:57.740 --> 01:53:59.300]   because the people out there are talking
[01:53:59.300 --> 01:54:00.460]   and they don't like it.
[01:54:00.460 --> 01:54:02.300]   So take that down the road.
[01:54:02.300 --> 01:54:04.100]   So this is a piece I wrote is very long.
[01:54:04.100 --> 01:54:04.500]   It's too long.
[01:54:04.500 --> 01:54:06.380]   But I really wanted to explore--
[01:54:06.380 --> 01:54:06.940]   I think it's true.
[01:54:06.940 --> 01:54:08.060]   Obviously, it's dystopian.
[01:54:08.060 --> 01:54:12.700]   It's your version of Jonathan Franzen's New Yorker article.
[01:54:12.700 --> 01:54:14.300]   Exactly.
[01:54:14.300 --> 01:54:15.380]   By the way--
[01:54:15.380 --> 01:54:17.380]   I'm saying we can stop this.
[01:54:17.380 --> 01:54:18.180]   We can stop it.
[01:54:18.180 --> 01:54:18.540]   We should.
[01:54:18.540 --> 01:54:22.980]   And I love the CODA, which I presume you wrote, which is--
[01:54:22.980 --> 01:54:25.580]   I'm sorry this essay proved to be controversial.
[01:54:25.580 --> 01:54:28.380]   Professor, I'm devastated you lost your quest for tenure.
[01:54:28.380 --> 01:54:30.500]   Thank you for challenging class.
[01:54:30.500 --> 01:54:33.660]   I wish you luck in your new career in the Tyro industry.
[01:54:33.660 --> 01:54:39.460]   The technology impact report optimization industry.
[01:54:39.460 --> 01:54:41.700]   And then the editor-- is that you or is that medium?
[01:54:41.700 --> 01:54:42.220]   That's me.
[01:54:42.220 --> 01:54:42.660]   That's me.
[01:54:42.660 --> 01:54:44.300]   This paper will get an A editor.
[01:54:44.300 --> 01:54:45.580]   I love it.
[01:54:45.580 --> 01:54:47.180]   It's in the year 2032.
[01:54:47.180 --> 01:54:48.060]   So very nice.
[01:54:48.060 --> 01:54:51.620]   Wait, did you clearly mark that as satire, Jeff?
[01:54:51.620 --> 01:54:56.620]   I marked it as history 302 fall semester 2032 final essay.
[01:54:56.620 --> 01:54:58.940]   If everybody doesn't get that, then fine.
[01:54:58.940 --> 01:55:00.260]   That sounds pretty serious.
[01:55:00.260 --> 01:55:00.780]   It's very lyric.
[01:55:00.780 --> 01:55:01.260]   Yes.
[01:55:01.260 --> 01:55:03.380]   I'm teasing you, Jeff.
[01:55:03.380 --> 01:55:05.500]   I did like my nickname.
[01:55:05.500 --> 01:55:07.580]   I'm now going to call you guys the distos.
[01:55:07.580 --> 01:55:08.100]   Distos.
[01:55:08.100 --> 01:55:09.100]   Distos.
[01:55:09.100 --> 01:55:10.060]   I was a techno.
[01:55:10.060 --> 01:55:10.900]   Now I'm a disto.
[01:55:10.900 --> 01:55:12.380]   Now you're a disto.
[01:55:12.380 --> 01:55:14.580]   It's the distos versus the tech-nose.
[01:55:14.580 --> 01:55:20.060]   If you distos win, this is the trouble that will then occur.
[01:55:20.060 --> 01:55:20.860]   Oh, dear.
[01:55:20.860 --> 01:55:24.260]   Oh, dear.
[01:55:24.260 --> 01:55:26.060]   Just a quick note, Richard Stallman
[01:55:26.060 --> 01:55:29.820]   has now not only resigned at MIT,
[01:55:29.820 --> 01:55:32.460]   but as well at the Free Software Foundation, which
[01:55:32.460 --> 01:55:34.540]   he led for a long time creating new Linux,
[01:55:34.540 --> 01:55:37.860]   he was a computer scientist, one of the original MIT hackers,
[01:55:37.860 --> 01:55:41.500]   who held some very controversial opinions.
[01:55:41.500 --> 01:55:42.820]   Regarding the Epstein situation.
[01:55:42.820 --> 01:55:44.900]   Regarding not just Epstein, but for 20 years,
[01:55:44.900 --> 01:55:48.740]   he's had very controversial opinions about pedophilia.
[01:55:48.740 --> 01:55:50.940]   I had somebody introduce me to him at some event,
[01:55:50.940 --> 01:55:52.940]   and he just went off in this ridiculous rant,
[01:55:52.940 --> 01:55:53.860]   and I walked away from him.
[01:55:53.860 --> 01:55:54.820]   I couldn't take it.
[01:55:54.820 --> 01:55:57.460]   I told my friend, don't just give me away from him.
[01:55:57.460 --> 01:55:59.340]   He's never been--
[01:55:59.340 --> 01:56:02.420]   He's always been a challenging person to be around.
[01:56:02.420 --> 01:56:06.260]   I've interviewed him, and I respect what he has done
[01:56:06.260 --> 01:56:07.620]   as a computer scientist.
[01:56:07.620 --> 01:56:09.820]   We wouldn't have Linux if probably, or if not
[01:56:09.820 --> 01:56:11.580]   for the Free Software Foundation.
[01:56:11.580 --> 01:56:16.860]   But he was always very adamant about his positions
[01:56:16.860 --> 01:56:18.500]   that no software should--
[01:56:18.500 --> 01:56:20.260]   software all software should be free.
[01:56:20.260 --> 01:56:21.660]   And apparently, he had some--
[01:56:21.660 --> 01:56:24.100]   I didn't actually was not aware of his--
[01:56:24.100 --> 01:56:27.580]   I wonder if he'll be investigated.
[01:56:27.580 --> 01:56:30.300]   You know, one of the things that came out in the Epstein thing
[01:56:30.300 --> 01:56:34.780]   that really disturbed me is that Marvin Minsky, who
[01:56:34.780 --> 01:56:38.300]   was a legendary artificial intelligence scientist,
[01:56:38.300 --> 01:56:41.500]   researcher, professor at MIT, apparently,
[01:56:41.500 --> 01:56:46.540]   according to accusations, misused his position as a professor
[01:56:46.540 --> 01:56:50.660]   to sleep with an underage undergraduate.
[01:56:50.660 --> 01:56:55.900]   And that really disturbed me, because even more than Richard
[01:56:55.900 --> 01:56:59.140]   Stalman, Marvin Minsky is a hero for artificial intelligence.
[01:56:59.140 --> 01:57:03.100]   So it goes deep, and it's not an agitation.
[01:57:03.100 --> 01:57:09.300]   This is an interesting thing, because no woman bothers
[01:57:09.300 --> 01:57:14.140]   to say someone is an intellectual and then clarifies it
[01:57:14.140 --> 01:57:15.140]   with--
[01:57:15.140 --> 01:57:17.620]   but they don't sleep with their students.
[01:57:17.620 --> 01:57:21.260]   Men seem to think that you can be intelligent,
[01:57:21.260 --> 01:57:23.700]   and it's weird that you're this genius,
[01:57:23.700 --> 01:57:26.020]   and you make these really crappy decisions that
[01:57:26.020 --> 01:57:28.180]   take advantage of people.
[01:57:28.180 --> 01:57:31.380]   And I'm constantly surprised when people express
[01:57:31.380 --> 01:57:32.340]   what you just did, Leo.
[01:57:32.340 --> 01:57:33.900]   And I'm not saying you're wrong to be this,
[01:57:33.900 --> 01:57:36.900]   but it's surprising to me that you
[01:57:36.900 --> 01:57:40.060]   think that those are related.
[01:57:40.060 --> 01:57:41.940]   So I guess I'm just throwing that out there,
[01:57:41.940 --> 01:57:44.620]   that people seem to-- oh, he was so good at this.
[01:57:44.620 --> 01:57:46.500]   Well, here's why I said it.
[01:57:46.500 --> 01:57:51.420]   And maybe you're right.
[01:57:51.420 --> 01:57:54.420]   He made some very important contributions to our field,
[01:57:54.420 --> 01:57:57.180]   very important, as did Marvin Minsky, very important.
[01:57:57.180 --> 01:58:00.860]   And I feel like that deserves to be acknowledged
[01:58:00.860 --> 01:58:02.820]   at the same time as we acknowledge
[01:58:02.820 --> 01:58:06.060]   that he was a complete jerk.
[01:58:06.060 --> 01:58:07.620]   Jaxle.
[01:58:07.620 --> 01:58:12.940]   And are you saying I shouldn't need to say both things?
[01:58:12.940 --> 01:58:16.900]   No, I guess when people say he was such a this,
[01:58:16.900 --> 01:58:20.460]   a credit to the field, I'm surprised he also--
[01:58:20.460 --> 01:58:21.660]   Well, he was not a credit.
[01:58:21.660 --> 01:58:23.020]   I won't say--
[01:58:23.020 --> 01:58:23.780]   A--
[01:58:23.780 --> 01:58:25.180]   He was not a credit to the field.
[01:58:25.180 --> 01:58:26.900]   He was exactly the opposite.
[01:58:26.900 --> 01:58:29.860]   And B, I'm not surprised because I have--
[01:58:29.860 --> 01:58:32.020]   like Jeff, we both had the experience.
[01:58:32.020 --> 01:58:36.380]   I mean, he had personality, strange personality disorder.
[01:58:36.380 --> 01:58:40.900]   But Minsky, I never met, I don't know, legendary--
[01:58:40.900 --> 01:58:43.820]   both of them legendary in computer science.
[01:58:43.820 --> 01:58:49.620]   And clearly, there were problems.
[01:58:49.620 --> 01:58:51.620]   So that happens across the board.
[01:58:51.620 --> 01:58:56.020]   I mean, there's separate issues.
[01:58:56.020 --> 01:58:57.380]   I don't think they need to be--
[01:58:57.380 --> 01:58:59.460]   Oh, OK.
[01:58:59.460 --> 01:59:01.780]   A lot of people are jerks.
[01:59:01.780 --> 01:59:02.740]   Yes.
[01:59:02.740 --> 01:59:06.700]   And they may do-- you know, there's
[01:59:06.700 --> 01:59:12.420]   a lot of great novelists, playwrights, movie directors
[01:59:12.420 --> 01:59:15.740]   whose work, whose art is great and whose personal life
[01:59:15.740 --> 01:59:18.860]   is despicable.
[01:59:18.860 --> 01:59:20.100]   What should we say about that?
[01:59:20.100 --> 01:59:20.580]   How do we--
[01:59:20.580 --> 01:59:22.180]   It's always very hard to separate.
[01:59:22.180 --> 01:59:26.220]   I'm not saying-- and I'm not saying you don't have to say anything.
[01:59:26.220 --> 01:59:28.100]   I'm not calling you to task on the same thing.
[01:59:28.100 --> 01:59:28.980]   No, you can if you--
[01:59:28.980 --> 01:59:36.500]   I am surprised when people try to say, oh, this person has
[01:59:36.500 --> 01:59:37.700]   done so much.
[01:59:37.700 --> 01:59:38.660]   And I'm surprised--
[01:59:38.660 --> 01:59:41.460]   I don't mean it as a way of saying, oh, that--
[01:59:41.460 --> 01:59:42.380]   It's not a mitigation.
[01:59:42.380 --> 01:59:43.220]   It's not a mitigation.
[01:59:43.220 --> 01:59:44.140]   --in any way.
[01:59:44.140 --> 01:59:45.140]   I'm not saying.
[01:59:45.140 --> 01:59:45.620]   I'm not really--
[01:59:45.620 --> 01:59:47.380]   In fact, it is the contrary because they
[01:59:47.380 --> 01:59:49.220]   use their positions--
[01:59:49.220 --> 01:59:49.580]   Yeah.
[01:59:49.580 --> 01:59:51.300]   --reperhensibly.
[01:59:51.300 --> 01:59:54.220]   So well, what are you saying, then?
[01:59:54.220 --> 01:59:58.740]   I'm surprised that someone couldn't be a predator
[01:59:58.740 --> 02:00:01.020]   and a really good person--
[02:00:01.020 --> 02:00:02.380]   or a really good--
[02:00:02.380 --> 02:00:03.220]   No, it happens all the time.
[02:00:03.220 --> 02:00:04.700]   --contributor to the field of AI.
[02:00:04.700 --> 02:00:05.180]   I guess--
[02:00:05.180 --> 02:00:06.380]   Bill Cosby was a great comedian.
[02:00:06.380 --> 02:00:08.260]   All right.
[02:00:08.260 --> 02:00:08.740]   Great.
[02:00:08.740 --> 02:00:10.420]   I like Michael Jackson's music.
[02:00:10.420 --> 02:00:13.100]   And by the way, this is a challenge we all face.
[02:00:13.100 --> 02:00:15.060]   Do I stop listening to Michael Jackson's music?
[02:00:15.900 --> 02:00:18.060]   I don't know what you decide.
[02:00:18.060 --> 02:00:19.820]   What do you Ellen films?
[02:00:19.820 --> 02:00:21.660]   Yeah, it's Wagner.
[02:00:21.660 --> 02:00:23.060]   I've never come on.
[02:00:23.060 --> 02:00:24.060]   It comes on.
[02:00:24.060 --> 02:00:28.060]   As a critic, I've never been able to decide in the end.
[02:00:28.060 --> 02:00:30.060]   Yeah, it's tough.
[02:00:30.060 --> 02:00:33.060]   Certainly a person's behavior in life
[02:00:33.060 --> 02:00:35.060]   can besmirch their reputation.
[02:00:35.060 --> 02:00:36.060]   Oh, yeah.
[02:00:36.060 --> 02:00:38.060]   But it doesn't necessarily diminish their art.
[02:00:38.060 --> 02:00:40.060]   Or do you feel like it does?
[02:00:40.060 --> 02:00:41.060]   Do you feel like it does?
[02:00:41.060 --> 02:00:43.060]   Do you feel like it does Stacey?
[02:00:43.060 --> 02:00:46.060]   Does it diminish their art?
[02:00:46.060 --> 02:00:49.060]   I think these people, because of their art,
[02:00:49.060 --> 02:00:51.060]   are given a pass, obviously.
[02:00:51.060 --> 02:00:52.060]   Right.
[02:00:52.060 --> 02:00:53.060]   And that's wrong.
[02:00:53.060 --> 02:00:54.060]   That's wrong.
[02:00:54.060 --> 02:00:55.060]   And that's what she is trying to say.
[02:00:55.060 --> 02:00:56.060]   But it's also--
[02:00:56.060 --> 02:00:59.060]   there are certain people who are more likely to get a pass.
[02:00:59.060 --> 02:01:02.060]   And there's even certain fields where people are more likely to get a pass.
[02:01:02.060 --> 02:01:03.060]   Mm-hmm.
[02:01:03.060 --> 02:01:05.060]   Like if you're in academia and you are a woman
[02:01:05.060 --> 02:01:07.060]   or probably a person of color,
[02:01:07.060 --> 02:01:10.060]   you probably don't get the same pass
[02:01:10.060 --> 02:01:13.060]   that these white guys who've contributed so much to their field.
[02:01:13.060 --> 02:01:18.060]   If you are in sports, like you're a football player,
[02:01:18.060 --> 02:01:23.060]   you don't get a pass that other people wouldn't get for beating up your girlfriend.
[02:01:23.060 --> 02:01:26.060]   Happens all the time.
[02:01:26.060 --> 02:01:29.060]   So those are just some of the things.
[02:01:29.060 --> 02:01:31.060]   I mean, this is one of those--
[02:01:31.060 --> 02:01:35.060]   I was just ad hoc expressing my surprise because it--
[02:01:35.060 --> 02:01:37.060]   because it hits me right here.
[02:01:37.060 --> 02:01:38.060]   No, and it's important to talk about.
[02:01:38.060 --> 02:01:39.060]   Oh, you're right.
[02:01:39.060 --> 02:01:40.060]   It's super important to talk about.
[02:01:40.060 --> 02:01:44.060]   I don't-- I completely want you to correct me.
[02:01:44.060 --> 02:01:45.060]   Oh, don't worry, though.
[02:01:45.060 --> 02:01:46.060]   I'm not going to shut up or anything.
[02:01:46.060 --> 02:01:47.060]   No.
[02:01:47.060 --> 02:01:48.060]   Furthermore, I want the correction.
[02:01:48.060 --> 02:01:49.060]   If you feel like--
[02:01:49.060 --> 02:01:50.060]   No.
[02:01:50.060 --> 02:01:51.060]   It's an appropriate way to talk about it.
[02:01:51.060 --> 02:01:53.060]   It wasn't a correction.
[02:01:53.060 --> 02:01:54.060]   It was just a--
[02:01:54.060 --> 02:01:55.060]   Huh.
[02:01:55.060 --> 02:01:59.060]   I don't think it's surprising at all that this person could be a sexual predator and good at AI research.
[02:01:59.060 --> 02:02:00.060]   They're not related.
[02:02:00.060 --> 02:02:01.060]   No.
[02:02:01.060 --> 02:02:02.060]   I'm not surprised.
[02:02:02.060 --> 02:02:03.060]   I'm disappointed.
[02:02:03.060 --> 02:02:04.060]   No.
[02:02:04.060 --> 02:02:05.060]   But you're right.
[02:02:05.060 --> 02:02:06.060]   I'm not surprised.
[02:02:06.060 --> 02:02:07.060]   I'm not a academia.
[02:02:07.060 --> 02:02:08.060]   My father is a professor.
[02:02:08.060 --> 02:02:15.060]   I'm very well aware of the horrific behavior of professors, male professors, going back
[02:02:15.060 --> 02:02:16.060]   generations.
[02:02:16.060 --> 02:02:25.060]   Speaking of which, by may, while we've been on the show, MIT had a large faculty meeting.
[02:02:25.060 --> 02:02:26.060]   Oh, really?
[02:02:26.060 --> 02:02:27.060]   Which are open.
[02:02:27.060 --> 02:02:28.060]   So Ethan Zuckerman live tweeted it all.
[02:02:28.060 --> 02:02:29.060]   Let me just read a couple of things here.
[02:02:29.060 --> 02:02:34.060]   Zuckerman with the one of the computer scientists who resigned from MIT Media Lab after the Epstein
[02:02:34.060 --> 02:02:35.060]   Revolution.
[02:02:35.060 --> 02:02:40.060]   So he said that Heather Paxson, I'm pursuing a faculty member, reads a letter from 61 senior
[02:02:40.060 --> 02:02:42.060]   women faculty members.
[02:02:42.060 --> 02:02:45.060]   Deep dismay at the Epstein situation, call for action.
[02:02:45.060 --> 02:02:49.060]   Fundraisers violated Institute values, especially in inviting Epstein to campus, attempts to
[02:02:49.060 --> 02:02:53.060]   conceal relationship, staff and students forced to collude.
[02:02:53.060 --> 02:02:58.060]   Situation symptomatic of larger cultural issues at MIT need to address gender and sexual implications
[02:02:58.060 --> 02:03:00.060]   of Epstein, not just fundraising issues.
[02:03:00.060 --> 02:03:02.060]   Sexual abuse survivors shaken by these actions.
[02:03:02.060 --> 02:03:05.060]   How can our leaders be trusted, given these violations?
[02:03:05.060 --> 02:03:12.060]   Lisa Parks, MIT, you know the department, says that there are 1,066 faculty members at
[02:03:12.060 --> 02:03:17.060]   MIT, only 266 are women, fewer than 30 are women of color.
[02:03:17.060 --> 02:03:23.060]   Our community says this tweet, according to her, "He feels undervalued, unsafe.
[02:03:23.060 --> 02:03:27.060]   MIT relationship with Epstein reveals a cultural crisis, a crisis in values.
[02:03:27.060 --> 02:03:29.060]   His ain't getting dropped and nor should it."
[02:03:29.060 --> 02:03:32.060]   Did you read Larry Lessig's apology?
[02:03:32.060 --> 02:03:33.060]   Oh, did I?
[02:03:33.060 --> 02:03:34.060]   I'm so disappointed.
[02:03:34.060 --> 02:03:40.060]   Me too, because here's another guy that I really look up to, I really admire.
[02:03:40.060 --> 02:03:46.060]   I honestly think that some of the issues he raised were not inappropriate.
[02:03:46.060 --> 02:03:48.060]   He pointed out that it's...
[02:03:48.060 --> 02:03:49.060]   It was illogical.
[02:03:49.060 --> 02:03:51.060]   Yeah, it was a lot.
[02:03:51.060 --> 02:03:54.060]   So, Stacy, and Ant, did you see that?
[02:03:54.060 --> 02:03:56.060]   I'm just now seeing this on the...
[02:03:56.060 --> 02:03:57.060]   Larry Lessig.
[02:03:57.060 --> 02:03:58.060]   It was short of an honor.
[02:03:58.060 --> 02:03:59.060]   Larry Lessig.
[02:03:59.060 --> 02:04:00.060]   I saw it.
[02:04:00.060 --> 02:04:01.060]   I saw it.
[02:04:01.060 --> 02:04:05.060]   The guy who created Creative Commons was running for president last time.
[02:04:05.060 --> 02:04:09.500]   And who believed that it was okay to take the money as long as it was kept anonymous, that
[02:04:09.500 --> 02:04:13.060]   making it anonymous, so you allegedly don't get anything out of it.
[02:04:13.060 --> 02:04:14.060]   It makes it okay.
[02:04:14.060 --> 02:04:19.060]   It wasn't White-washing Epstein's reputation because it was done anonymously.
[02:04:19.060 --> 02:04:23.060]   That, I'm sure, was the justification in the MIT administrators' minds as well.
[02:04:23.060 --> 02:04:29.060]   But, Augustine, what he wanted, which was introductions to science leaders and others to say young
[02:04:29.060 --> 02:04:30.060]   students.
[02:04:30.060 --> 02:04:34.060]   And it did, in fact, probably White-wash his reputation somewhat among those who knew.
[02:04:34.060 --> 02:04:35.060]   Yeah.
[02:04:35.060 --> 02:04:36.060]   I feel...
[02:04:36.060 --> 02:04:37.060]   Yeah, I like Larry a lot.
[02:04:37.060 --> 02:04:43.060]   He's been on our shows, and I think the world of him, and again, he's wrong on this one.
[02:04:43.060 --> 02:04:47.060]   I think that a lot of times there's...
[02:04:47.060 --> 02:04:49.060]   He may not recognize the...
[02:04:49.060 --> 02:04:56.660]   And I hate to say privilege, but he may not recognize that an anonymous donation, he may
[02:04:56.660 --> 02:05:01.260]   not understand the impact of what he's quite saying, because he doesn't live in a world
[02:05:01.260 --> 02:05:02.660]   where that matters to him.
[02:05:02.660 --> 02:05:06.900]   The one thing I thought that he raised, though, I thought was interesting, though, is there
[02:05:06.900 --> 02:05:11.980]   is a range of misbehavior among donors.
[02:05:11.980 --> 02:05:16.900]   And often institutions kind of have to hold their nose.
[02:05:16.900 --> 02:05:19.100]   And he said, "Well, where is the line drawn?"
[02:05:19.100 --> 02:05:23.220]   I mean, clearly, Jeffrey Epstein is definitely way beyond the veil.
[02:05:23.220 --> 02:05:24.900]   There's not any question.
[02:05:24.900 --> 02:05:25.900]   But people...
[02:05:25.900 --> 02:05:28.460]   The MIT object to Coke money, but others were not.
[02:05:28.460 --> 02:05:29.460]   Oh, yeah.
[02:05:29.460 --> 02:05:30.460]   Well, there you go.
[02:05:30.460 --> 02:05:31.460]   Right, that's all that's right.
[02:05:31.460 --> 02:05:32.460]   And I was at the USC.
[02:05:32.460 --> 02:05:33.460]   We...
[02:05:33.460 --> 02:05:37.540]   The student body wanted to reject a bunch of money from Jim Bob.
[02:05:37.540 --> 02:05:38.540]   I can't think of it.
[02:05:38.540 --> 02:05:41.700]   Mac Moran, the free-port Mac Moran guy.
[02:05:41.700 --> 02:05:44.180]   It was mining, strip mining, very bad at the time.
[02:05:44.180 --> 02:05:45.740]   And they took the money.
[02:05:45.740 --> 02:05:46.740]   They built it in...
[02:05:46.740 --> 02:05:54.860]   Carnegie, who was a horrible human, and made his fortune as a US Steel and trust busting...
[02:05:54.860 --> 02:05:57.620]   or a union busting.
[02:05:57.620 --> 02:05:59.620]   In his later life bill, all these libraries.
[02:05:59.620 --> 02:06:01.780]   Do you reject those libraries?
[02:06:01.780 --> 02:06:06.060]   Because the money came from Andrew Carnegie and the blood and sweat tears of steel workers?
[02:06:06.060 --> 02:06:07.060]   Or do you say, "Well..."
[02:06:07.060 --> 02:06:10.180]   People may strip in the Sackler name off of things.
[02:06:10.180 --> 02:06:11.740]   Well, as they should.
[02:06:11.740 --> 02:06:13.940]   Well, I mean, there you go.
[02:06:13.940 --> 02:06:16.940]   I mean, we're drawing lines all the time.
[02:06:16.940 --> 02:06:20.980]   But do you not build the library because of that?
[02:06:20.980 --> 02:06:23.460]   Do you say, "No, Andrew Carnegie, your money is blood money.
[02:06:23.460 --> 02:06:25.940]   I will not take that free library money."
[02:06:25.940 --> 02:06:30.140]   There are free libraries all over the country built with his money.
[02:06:30.140 --> 02:06:32.980]   Do they have his name on them as a requirement?
[02:06:32.980 --> 02:06:33.980]   Many of them...
[02:06:33.980 --> 02:06:34.980]   Well, ours does not.
[02:06:34.980 --> 02:06:35.980]   It was a black song.
[02:06:35.980 --> 02:06:38.100]   It says "Free Public Library" on the one in Petaluma.
[02:06:38.100 --> 02:06:41.660]   It's a beautiful building.
[02:06:41.660 --> 02:06:42.660]   Probably yes.
[02:06:42.660 --> 02:06:44.580]   Well-known, the Carnegie did it.
[02:06:44.580 --> 02:06:47.300]   Everybody knows it was to whitewash his reputation.
[02:06:47.300 --> 02:06:51.420]   Bill freakin' Gates.
[02:06:51.420 --> 02:06:56.540]   The work that he's doing, do you say, "Well, we don't want to take Gates' money because
[02:06:56.540 --> 02:06:59.540]   Gates was a robber baron in the 90s?"
[02:06:59.540 --> 02:07:03.300]   Okay, there's a vast difference between Gates' robber baron.
[02:07:03.300 --> 02:07:04.300]   But that's the point.
[02:07:04.300 --> 02:07:05.300]   It's a continuum.
[02:07:05.300 --> 02:07:06.300]   It's a continuum.
[02:07:06.300 --> 02:07:07.300]   It's a continuum.
[02:07:07.300 --> 02:07:09.340]   Where do you draw the line?
[02:07:09.340 --> 02:07:11.460]   I think that's where we are.
[02:07:11.460 --> 02:07:14.300]   I mean, that's the front in the nightmare.
[02:07:14.300 --> 02:07:17.060]   We wouldn't have a National Park Service without the Naraka Fellers.
[02:07:17.060 --> 02:07:20.620]   Well, so this is part of people's participation in a democracy, right?
[02:07:20.620 --> 02:07:24.180]   Back then, the people who were deciding whether or not they took the money, they probably looked
[02:07:24.180 --> 02:07:27.860]   at the Naraka Fellers and Carnegie's as fellow travelers, right?
[02:07:27.860 --> 02:07:34.020]   When you have more people with more say, which we're opening up, more people, like everybody
[02:07:34.020 --> 02:07:36.980]   in the white male contingencies is like, "Yeah, I've seen you're fine.
[02:07:36.980 --> 02:07:38.820]   I like young girls too."
[02:07:38.820 --> 02:07:45.180]   When MIT students were like, "As a young person who does not want to be preyed upon, I think
[02:07:45.180 --> 02:07:47.420]   this sucks.
[02:07:47.420 --> 02:07:48.900]   That's the conversation you have.
[02:07:48.900 --> 02:07:50.220]   You can't draw a line.
[02:07:50.220 --> 02:07:55.100]   You certainly can't draw a line based on the current power structures.
[02:07:55.100 --> 02:07:57.260]   That's why we're having all these fun power structures.
[02:07:57.260 --> 02:07:58.900]   That's the problem, isn't it?
[02:07:58.900 --> 02:08:00.140]   Yes.
[02:08:00.140 --> 02:08:01.900]   That's that privilege problem.
[02:08:01.900 --> 02:08:04.100]   It's a structural problem.
[02:08:04.100 --> 02:08:10.340]   That's a structural problem is that when only some people are having, when out of a 1,066
[02:08:10.340 --> 02:08:14.180]   professor is only 30 or women of color at MIT, then who's having the discussion?
[02:08:14.180 --> 02:08:16.660]   In a faculty meeting, we're only a faculty can talk.
[02:08:16.660 --> 02:08:18.820]   Who's at the table?
[02:08:18.820 --> 02:08:19.820]   Okay.
[02:08:19.820 --> 02:08:22.060]   Now I need another story.
[02:08:22.060 --> 02:08:24.220]   Okay, one other story and then I'm going to get it.
[02:08:24.220 --> 02:08:25.220]   We should just mention it.
[02:08:25.220 --> 02:08:26.220]   You saw that problem.
[02:08:26.220 --> 02:08:27.220]   Move it on.
[02:08:27.220 --> 02:08:33.300]   Quickly, Facebook, and I've written about it before, but Facebook's oversight board.
[02:08:33.300 --> 02:08:42.540]   This afternoon, your time, they announced the final rules for it, the charter, the structure.
[02:08:42.540 --> 02:08:43.540]   I've written about this.
[02:08:43.540 --> 02:08:47.380]   I went to two meetings with a variety of people.
[02:08:47.380 --> 02:08:48.380]   Good deal.
[02:08:48.380 --> 02:08:49.380]   I think it could be.
[02:08:49.380 --> 02:08:58.820]   Zuckerberg says, "They will have non-videable ability to say, 'Nope, that's gone.'
[02:08:58.820 --> 02:09:05.100]   Or vice versa."
[02:09:05.100 --> 02:09:07.380]   Who are these people?
[02:09:07.380 --> 02:09:08.380]   That's the next step.
[02:09:08.380 --> 02:09:14.180]   They're going to have 40 and the structures they're going to have about, they brought
[02:09:14.180 --> 02:09:18.700]   into consultants and all kinds of people, the hydro-construggles and all these search
[02:09:18.700 --> 02:09:23.900]   companies, and they're going to try to come up with, I think, 8 to 10 people.
[02:09:23.900 --> 02:09:29.260]   Facebook will indeed pick, but a minority of the 40 in the end, and then those people
[02:09:29.260 --> 02:09:34.300]   will pick everyone else who joins the oversight board then's fourth.
[02:09:34.300 --> 02:09:35.300]   I nominate...
[02:09:35.300 --> 02:09:36.300]   So they'll seed it.
[02:09:36.300 --> 02:09:37.300]   Jeff Jarvis, for this one.
[02:09:37.300 --> 02:09:38.300]   No, no.
[02:09:38.300 --> 02:09:41.460]   They would not be out of love, too.
[02:09:41.460 --> 02:09:43.380]   I have a question for Leo.
[02:09:43.380 --> 02:09:44.380]   Yes.
[02:09:44.380 --> 02:09:45.380]   Just kidding.
[02:09:45.380 --> 02:09:46.380]   This is a new story, so keep going, Jeff.
[02:09:46.380 --> 02:09:48.940]   No, this is a big step forward.
[02:09:48.940 --> 02:09:50.460]   I think this is a big step.
[02:09:50.460 --> 02:09:56.860]   Looks good from the point of view of how to solve Facebook's tough, difficult problem.
[02:09:56.860 --> 02:09:57.860]   It doesn't solve at all.
[02:09:57.860 --> 02:09:58.860]   It's not going to scale.
[02:09:58.860 --> 02:10:00.860]   It's only going to do with certain issues.
[02:10:00.860 --> 02:10:05.580]   Yeah, but at least it's not Mark Zuckerberg saying, "Let's go ahead and do it."
[02:10:05.580 --> 02:10:09.700]   Yeah, and the people who did this process, I have immense respect for.
[02:10:09.700 --> 02:10:10.700]   They're very smart.
[02:10:10.700 --> 02:10:11.700]   They work through everything.
[02:10:11.700 --> 02:10:13.620]   They listen to tons of people.
[02:10:13.620 --> 02:10:15.180]   Does it solve everything?
[02:10:15.180 --> 02:10:16.820]   Absolutely, of course not.
[02:10:16.820 --> 02:10:22.540]   It creates an independent voice, a mechanism of appeal, a pressure on Facebook on not just
[02:10:22.540 --> 02:10:25.460]   specific takedowns, but also on policy.
[02:10:25.460 --> 02:10:26.460]   And we'll see.
[02:10:26.460 --> 02:10:29.660]   It's a definite we'll see, but I think it's a decent step.
[02:10:29.660 --> 02:10:31.900]   That's much more to make sure we mark that today.
[02:10:31.900 --> 02:10:32.900]   Thank you, yes.
[02:10:32.900 --> 02:10:33.900]   You're absolutely right.
[02:10:33.900 --> 02:10:36.260]   And full disclosure, I raise money for my school from Facebook.
[02:10:36.260 --> 02:10:37.260]   I'm independent of Facebook.
[02:10:37.260 --> 02:10:39.660]   I receive nothing personally from Facebook.
[02:10:39.660 --> 02:10:42.460]   Stacy, your last story.
[02:10:42.460 --> 02:10:43.460]   This is just a question.
[02:10:43.460 --> 02:10:46.740]   Speaking of Facebook, Leo, are you going to buy the new Cheaper Portal?
[02:10:46.740 --> 02:10:47.740]   No.
[02:10:47.740 --> 02:10:48.740]   [laughter]
[02:10:48.740 --> 02:10:50.740]   Built for your TV.
[02:10:50.740 --> 02:10:54.220]   What about the one you just hook onto your TV?
[02:10:54.220 --> 02:10:57.380]   Some of the ones you watch every time you watch TV.
[02:10:57.380 --> 02:10:58.380]   We're listening.
[02:10:58.380 --> 02:10:59.380]   We're listening to you.
[02:10:59.380 --> 02:11:00.380]   We're listening.
[02:11:00.380 --> 02:11:01.380]   We hear you.
[02:11:01.380 --> 02:11:02.380]   We hear you.
[02:11:02.380 --> 02:11:03.620]   We hear you.
[02:11:03.620 --> 02:11:05.620]   We hear you.
[02:11:05.620 --> 02:11:06.460]   Holy cow.
[02:11:06.460 --> 02:11:10.020]   Why do they keep putting this stuff out?
[02:11:10.020 --> 02:11:12.220]   And apparent they're selling it.
[02:11:12.220 --> 02:11:15.340]   The portals are supposedly selling well, yeah.
[02:11:15.340 --> 02:11:17.620]   These are cheap, right?
[02:11:17.620 --> 02:11:18.620]   These are $20.
[02:11:18.620 --> 02:11:19.620]   $20 cheaper?
[02:11:19.620 --> 02:11:20.620]   $179.
[02:11:20.620 --> 02:11:21.620]   And I think $129.
[02:11:21.620 --> 02:11:25.980]   The portal and portal mini, $179 and $129 shipping starts next month.
[02:11:25.980 --> 02:11:26.980]   The portal to you.
[02:11:26.980 --> 02:11:27.980]   Here's something to think about.
[02:11:27.980 --> 02:11:31.500]   They haven't figured out a business model for this yet.
[02:11:31.500 --> 02:11:34.620]   Would you do this without a business model from Facebook?
[02:11:34.620 --> 02:11:36.620]   There's a business model.
[02:11:36.620 --> 02:11:40.060]   There's definitely a business model.
[02:11:40.060 --> 02:11:45.180]   Facebook puts microphones and cameras in your home, but there's no business model?
[02:11:45.180 --> 02:11:46.180]   I think there's a business model.
[02:11:46.180 --> 02:11:51.260]   They've also just updated the terms of service.
[02:11:51.260 --> 02:11:55.580]   You can opt out of certain things now.
[02:11:55.580 --> 02:11:57.420]   It gives a pilot program.
[02:11:57.420 --> 02:12:03.460]   Or you can opt out of them collecting audio clips.
[02:12:03.460 --> 02:12:08.140]   I mean, so it's Facebook doing essentially what Amazon and Google are doing.
[02:12:08.140 --> 02:12:10.020]   Right.
[02:12:10.020 --> 02:12:12.060]   That is the truth statement.
[02:12:12.060 --> 02:12:15.300]   Is it that we trust Facebook less than Amazon and Google?
[02:12:15.300 --> 02:12:16.300]   Are we wise?
[02:12:16.300 --> 02:12:17.300]   To be fair, I do.
[02:12:17.300 --> 02:12:18.740]   Are we wise to do something?
[02:12:18.740 --> 02:12:25.140]   Facebook is like not only have they gone out and outright lied to us on more than one
[02:12:25.140 --> 02:12:28.860]   occasion about what they're doing with your data.
[02:12:28.860 --> 02:12:29.860]   Pass in a book.
[02:12:29.860 --> 02:12:34.060]   They come out each time and apologize and thinks that it's suddenly okay.
[02:12:34.060 --> 02:12:35.060]   Right.
[02:12:35.060 --> 02:12:36.060]   It's not.
[02:12:36.060 --> 02:12:37.060]   Now they haven't shown--
[02:12:37.060 --> 02:12:38.060]   Which goes to--
[02:12:38.060 --> 02:12:44.860]   In Philadelphia, internally they should be doing technology impact reports and saying
[02:12:44.860 --> 02:12:46.060]   what could go wrong.
[02:12:46.060 --> 02:12:47.060]   By the way.
[02:12:47.060 --> 02:12:49.180]   It could use this badly.
[02:12:49.180 --> 02:12:50.180]   Facebook.
[02:12:50.180 --> 02:12:54.660]   It is to be noted is trying to trademark the word book in Europe.
[02:12:54.660 --> 02:12:56.780]   Are you serious?
[02:12:56.780 --> 02:12:57.780]   What?
[02:12:57.780 --> 02:13:02.660]   Not for you, Gutenberg.
[02:13:02.660 --> 02:13:07.740]   They apparently have rights over the word face in the United States.
[02:13:07.740 --> 02:13:08.740]   Face blank, right?
[02:13:08.740 --> 02:13:09.740]   Face blank.
[02:13:09.740 --> 02:13:12.580]   They also have Facebook in the Facebook.
[02:13:12.580 --> 02:13:17.020]   But they're trying to get book.
[02:13:17.020 --> 02:13:18.860]   This is from the register.co.uk.
[02:13:18.860 --> 02:13:22.220]   In cheerier, intellectual property news from the United States.
[02:13:22.220 --> 02:13:28.420]   Last week, the Ohio State University lost its attempt to trademark the word "the".
[02:13:28.420 --> 02:13:29.900]   Okay.
[02:13:29.900 --> 02:13:37.700]   That now I need a drink of water.
[02:13:37.700 --> 02:13:38.700]   Whiskey.
[02:13:38.700 --> 02:13:42.460]   And I will get that as soon as I tell you about the thing that saves me.
[02:13:42.460 --> 02:13:43.460]   Carson, we use this.
[02:13:43.460 --> 02:13:46.420]   Zapier saves me so much time.
[02:13:46.420 --> 02:13:51.660]   It's always been said amongst programmers, amongst IT professional cis and men.
[02:13:51.660 --> 02:13:54.380]   If you do something more than a couple of times, you should automate it.
[02:13:54.380 --> 02:13:56.900]   You should write a script.
[02:13:56.900 --> 02:14:01.220]   But if you're not a cis and men or an IT professional or programmer, can you do this?
[02:14:01.220 --> 02:14:02.500]   Yes, you can.
[02:14:02.500 --> 02:14:04.300]   With Zapier.
[02:14:04.300 --> 02:14:08.460]   Zapier makes it easy to automate the things you do over and over again.
[02:14:08.460 --> 02:14:09.460]   Especially in business.
[02:14:09.460 --> 02:14:13.180]   Zapier has over 1500 plus connected apps.
[02:14:13.180 --> 02:14:18.300]   All the apps you use, of course, Facebook and Twitter, but all the apps, CRM apps like
[02:14:18.300 --> 02:14:26.820]   Salesforce, it lets you create multi-step zaps that automate your workflow.
[02:14:26.820 --> 02:14:28.620]   And I just love it.
[02:14:28.620 --> 02:14:31.820]   You can use it to, well, here's what Carson and I do.
[02:14:31.820 --> 02:14:34.980]   I'm in my newsreader and I start an article.
[02:14:34.980 --> 02:14:42.500]   It automatically takes that, tweets it to a special looks for Twitter account.
[02:14:42.500 --> 02:14:44.780]   It pinboards it so I have that bookmark.
[02:14:44.780 --> 02:14:49.660]   And then it makes a line and a spreadsheet, a shared Google Doc spreadsheet so that Carson
[02:14:49.660 --> 02:14:52.860]   can easily cut it and paste it into the show rundowns.
[02:14:52.860 --> 02:14:56.340]   And all I do is press a button and it does it all automatically.
[02:14:56.340 --> 02:15:03.620]   I have the same script is also taking anything that I favorite using pinboard.
[02:15:03.620 --> 02:15:05.340]   So it's just amazing.
[02:15:05.340 --> 02:15:06.540]   But it's your email.
[02:15:06.540 --> 02:15:10.460]   You could, for instance, you could have, you get a new lead, you could engage them automatically
[02:15:10.460 --> 02:15:14.980]   important new customers, notify your team about opportunities with one click of the mouse.
[02:15:14.980 --> 02:15:16.420]   They walk you through it.
[02:15:16.420 --> 02:15:17.860]   So no programming involved.
[02:15:17.860 --> 02:15:18.860]   You can do it.
[02:15:18.860 --> 02:15:20.860]   It's very simple.
[02:15:20.860 --> 02:15:24.340]   And they give you ways to test every step of the way so you know exactly what's going
[02:15:24.340 --> 02:15:25.340]   on.

[02:15:31.260 --> 02:15:32.580]   Don't have to go to the IT department.
[02:15:32.580 --> 02:15:33.580]   Don't have to go to developer.

[02:16:03.500 --> 02:16:04.500]   I pay for this starter.
[02:16:04.500 --> 02:16:05.980]   Enough scripts to do everything I need.
[02:16:05.980 --> 02:16:07.620]   I just love it.

[02:16:11.420 --> 02:16:14.220]   You will want this.
[02:16:14.220 --> 02:16:17.060]   Alright Stacey, tell me something good.
[02:16:17.060 --> 02:16:18.060]   Tell Miss Sun.
[02:16:18.060 --> 02:16:19.060]   Alright.
[02:16:19.060 --> 02:16:21.500]   I was just about to say, start singing.
[02:16:21.500 --> 02:16:22.500]   Okay.
[02:16:22.500 --> 02:16:23.500]   Okay.
[02:16:23.500 --> 02:16:26.740]   Because I'm crazy, I've purchased an advent calendar.
[02:16:26.740 --> 02:16:27.740]   Wait a minute.
[02:16:27.740 --> 02:16:29.300]   Christmas is a few months off.
[02:16:29.300 --> 02:16:30.300]   I know.
[02:16:30.300 --> 02:16:31.300]   You guys.
[02:16:31.300 --> 02:16:32.300]   She's crazy.
[02:16:32.300 --> 02:16:35.540]   I'm sure you're a box opening.
[02:16:35.540 --> 02:16:40.220]   I'm unboxing it and I'm going to open it for the first day to show you if this is a
[02:16:40.220 --> 02:16:42.340]   good thing for you to buy.
[02:16:42.340 --> 02:16:43.340]   Is it a...
[02:16:43.340 --> 02:16:45.340]   I always wanted to buy a cheese advent.
[02:16:45.340 --> 02:16:46.340]   What did she do last year?
[02:16:46.340 --> 02:16:47.340]   It was gin last year.
[02:16:47.340 --> 02:16:48.340]   Gin, that's right.
[02:16:48.340 --> 02:16:49.340]   Gin.
[02:16:49.340 --> 02:16:50.340]   What is this?
[02:16:50.340 --> 02:16:51.740]   So this is the Funko Pop.
[02:16:51.740 --> 02:16:52.740]   Oh!
[02:16:52.740 --> 02:16:55.460]   Marvel's Advent Calendar.
[02:16:55.460 --> 02:16:56.460]   What the hell is that?
[02:16:56.460 --> 02:16:57.460]   What is that?
[02:16:57.460 --> 02:16:58.460]   I've seen this.
[02:16:58.460 --> 02:16:59.940]   Do you know what Funko Pop's are?
[02:16:59.940 --> 02:17:02.420]   They're the little things with the big heads.
[02:17:02.420 --> 02:17:04.300]   The little dolls with the big heads.
[02:17:04.300 --> 02:17:05.860]   So is this for your kid?
[02:17:05.860 --> 02:17:08.860]   For both of us.
[02:17:08.860 --> 02:17:10.860]   I was like...
[02:17:10.860 --> 02:17:14.300]   Oh, you get Marvel characters.
[02:17:14.300 --> 02:17:16.300]   Yes, this is the Marvel one.
[02:17:16.300 --> 02:17:20.540]   I'm going to open it so I can show you the quality of the Funko Pop.
[02:17:20.540 --> 02:17:21.900]   Oh, that's what those are called.
[02:17:21.900 --> 02:17:23.460]   I never knew what those things were called.
[02:17:23.460 --> 02:17:24.860]   They're little characters.
[02:17:24.860 --> 02:17:27.140]   Little plastic characters with giant heads.
[02:17:27.140 --> 02:17:29.660]   Alright, so here we go, you guys.
[02:17:29.660 --> 02:17:32.420]   So you can see the calendar.
[02:17:32.420 --> 02:17:33.860]   Don't open the first one.
[02:17:33.860 --> 02:17:34.860]   That's going to spoil it.
[02:17:34.860 --> 02:17:37.260]   No, don't you want to say...
[02:17:37.260 --> 02:17:41.420]   Okay, tell me if you want to see the quality of the Funko Pop's inside.
[02:17:41.420 --> 02:17:43.340]   Your camera quality is not so good.
[02:17:43.340 --> 02:17:44.980]   I'd rather just show the...
[02:17:44.980 --> 02:17:45.980]   Yeah, we can see it here.
[02:17:45.980 --> 02:17:46.980]   Don't open it.
[02:17:46.980 --> 02:17:47.980]   Don't open it.
[02:17:47.980 --> 02:17:48.980]   We can see it.
[02:17:48.980 --> 02:17:49.980]   It'll be...
[02:17:49.980 --> 02:17:51.540]   We've got a nice picture.
[02:17:51.540 --> 02:17:52.540]   Oh, go ahead.
[02:17:52.540 --> 02:17:53.540]   Don't spoil it.
[02:17:53.540 --> 02:17:54.540]   We can't.
[02:17:54.540 --> 02:17:56.300]   We can't now let it sit.
[02:17:56.300 --> 02:18:00.580]   By the way, they also have a Harry Potter Funko Pop.
[02:18:00.580 --> 02:18:01.580]   Whoa.
[02:18:01.580 --> 02:18:03.060]   Whoa.
[02:18:03.060 --> 02:18:05.180]   With all your favorite characters.
[02:18:05.180 --> 02:18:08.500]   They also have a Lego.
[02:18:08.500 --> 02:18:09.660]   Has anybody done the...
[02:18:09.660 --> 02:18:10.660]   I've done the...
[02:18:10.660 --> 02:18:11.660]   I've done the Lego ones.
[02:18:11.660 --> 02:18:13.060]   I do the Lego ones a lot.
[02:18:13.060 --> 02:18:14.940]   Yeah, Star Wars.
[02:18:14.940 --> 02:18:16.020]   I love Advent College.
[02:18:16.020 --> 02:18:17.460]   We should just have one for every month.
[02:18:17.460 --> 02:18:19.300]   So this is what I've been missing out on.
[02:18:19.300 --> 02:18:22.540]   Fortnite Funko Pop.
[02:18:22.540 --> 02:18:24.940]   Oh, yeah, there's a Fortnite Funko Pop.
[02:18:24.940 --> 02:18:26.420]   Fortnite Funko Pop.
[02:18:26.420 --> 02:18:27.420]   Oh, no.
[02:18:27.420 --> 02:18:28.420]   Is that a nightmare?
[02:18:28.420 --> 02:18:30.780]   I just wanted to show you guys.
[02:18:30.780 --> 02:18:32.740]   Okay, show us our Funko Pop.
[02:18:32.740 --> 02:18:33.740]   Let's see.
[02:18:33.740 --> 02:18:34.740]   Go ahead.
[02:18:34.740 --> 02:18:35.740]   Ruin it for your daughter.
[02:18:35.740 --> 02:18:36.740]   She's 13.
[02:18:36.740 --> 02:18:37.740]   Come on.
[02:18:37.740 --> 02:18:39.740]   This is really for mom.
[02:18:39.740 --> 02:18:44.340]   Most of the time, I was doing it as a service to everybody who might be considering one of
[02:18:44.340 --> 02:18:45.340]   these.
[02:18:45.340 --> 02:18:47.660]   So you think they're really nicely made?
[02:18:47.660 --> 02:18:48.660]   I don't know.
[02:18:48.660 --> 02:18:49.820]   I don't know the quality.
[02:18:49.820 --> 02:18:51.980]   That's really important in an Advent calendar.
[02:18:51.980 --> 02:18:53.180]   So I'm showing you.
[02:18:53.180 --> 02:18:54.540]   They come prepackaged.
[02:18:54.540 --> 02:18:55.540]   Nice.
[02:18:55.540 --> 02:18:56.540]   And...
[02:18:56.540 --> 02:19:01.940]   And then cut it open.
[02:19:01.940 --> 02:19:02.940]   How do I feel?
[02:19:02.940 --> 02:19:05.180]   Oh, these are good quality Funko Pop.
[02:19:05.180 --> 02:19:07.100]   Oh man, they're face lit.
[02:19:07.100 --> 02:19:09.980]   Oh man, these are good quality Funko Pop.
[02:19:09.980 --> 02:19:10.980]   She says...
[02:19:10.980 --> 02:19:11.980]   No, wait.
[02:19:11.980 --> 02:19:12.980]   They're actually...
[02:19:12.980 --> 02:19:17.380]   Well, but they're not like the cheap plastic ones with the paint that kind of doesn't cover
[02:19:17.380 --> 02:19:18.380]   things properly.
[02:19:18.380 --> 02:19:19.380]   These are good.
[02:19:19.380 --> 02:19:20.380]   That is beautiful.
[02:19:20.380 --> 02:19:21.380]   Okay.
[02:19:21.380 --> 02:19:23.060]   I heartily endorse.
[02:19:23.060 --> 02:19:24.780]   And this guy is...
[02:19:24.780 --> 02:19:25.780]   Is this Iron Man?
[02:19:25.780 --> 02:19:26.780]   That's Iron Man.
[02:19:26.780 --> 02:19:27.780]   That's Iron Man.
[02:19:27.780 --> 02:19:28.780]   No.
[02:19:28.780 --> 02:19:29.780]   I think this is a...
[02:19:29.780 --> 02:19:30.780]   Really?
[02:19:30.780 --> 02:19:31.780]   Yeah.
[02:19:31.780 --> 02:19:32.780]   So it looks like Iron Man.
[02:19:32.780 --> 02:19:33.780]   Mark 2.
[02:19:33.780 --> 02:19:34.780]   Mark 3.
[02:19:34.780 --> 02:19:35.780]   Iron Man Mark 3.
[02:19:35.780 --> 02:19:36.780]   Oh, I think you should get this.
[02:19:36.780 --> 02:19:37.780]   Oh my God, Kirsten.
[02:19:37.780 --> 02:19:38.780]   I love you so much.
[02:19:38.780 --> 02:19:39.780]   I clearly am not nerdy enough for this.
[02:19:39.780 --> 02:19:40.780]   Wow.
[02:19:40.780 --> 02:19:41.780]   Okay.
[02:19:41.780 --> 02:19:42.780]   So I am pro.
[02:19:42.780 --> 02:19:44.900]   I can heartily recommend these now.
[02:19:44.900 --> 02:19:46.660]   I feel good.
[02:19:46.660 --> 02:19:47.660]   I was concerned.
[02:19:47.660 --> 02:19:49.580]   That's why I felt like I had to open it and show you guys.
[02:19:49.580 --> 02:19:54.140]   So if you wanted to buy these for you or your children or your office.
[02:19:54.140 --> 02:19:59.020]   So last year you did the gin advent calendar, but I'm seeing they also have Irish whiskey,
[02:19:59.020 --> 02:20:03.020]   cognac, bourbon and American whiskey advent calendars.
[02:20:03.020 --> 02:20:05.860]   Oh, here's a Japanese whiskey advent calendar.
[02:20:05.860 --> 02:20:07.580]   Oh, oh, here's your Japanese.
[02:20:07.580 --> 02:20:08.580]   The Hibiki.
[02:20:08.580 --> 02:20:09.580]   Hibiki.
[02:20:09.580 --> 02:20:10.580]   Heartily.
[02:20:10.580 --> 02:20:11.700]   Is a lovely whiskey.
[02:20:11.700 --> 02:20:12.700]   Should you like it?
[02:20:12.700 --> 02:20:13.700]   Ah.
[02:20:13.700 --> 02:20:14.700]   That's not...
[02:20:14.700 --> 02:20:15.700]   It's always a good...
[02:20:15.700 --> 02:20:17.060]   It's fine now.
[02:20:17.060 --> 02:20:18.900]   Your best bet is duty free.
[02:20:18.900 --> 02:20:20.380]   Yep.
[02:20:20.380 --> 02:20:23.700]   And then I'm just going to give you another whiskey recommendation if you wanted it.
[02:20:23.700 --> 02:20:24.700]   Please do.
[02:20:24.700 --> 02:20:25.700]   But that's two things.
[02:20:25.700 --> 02:20:26.700]   We do.
[02:20:26.700 --> 02:20:30.540]   Because I live in Washington, I went and tasted some Washington whiskeys.
[02:20:30.540 --> 02:20:33.940]   And I can tell you the Windville whiskey.
[02:20:33.940 --> 02:20:36.020]   So it's WindvilleWhiskeyCo.com.
[02:20:36.020 --> 02:20:38.980]   Their Windville double barrel whiskey is excellent.
[02:20:38.980 --> 02:20:39.980]   Mm-hmm.
[02:20:39.980 --> 02:20:43.060]   It is very smooth and quite delicious.
[02:20:43.060 --> 02:20:44.060]   Now we're going...
[02:20:44.060 --> 02:20:45.060]   And not...
[02:20:45.060 --> 02:20:50.620]   Next week we're going to have an event at our local distillery, which Griffo, which makes
[02:20:50.620 --> 02:20:52.420]   whiskey.
[02:20:52.420 --> 02:20:55.300]   So we'll let you know how that Griffo is.
[02:20:55.300 --> 02:20:56.300]   Micro distillery.
[02:20:56.300 --> 02:20:57.300]   It's a micro distillery.
[02:20:57.300 --> 02:20:58.300]   It suddenly becomes...
[02:20:58.300 --> 02:21:04.060]   It turns out we are in kind of distillery alley here.
[02:21:04.060 --> 02:21:06.220]   Started with Lagunita's beer.
[02:21:06.220 --> 02:21:09.940]   Now there's a bunch of distilleries and beers and you can get abs...
[02:21:09.940 --> 02:21:10.940]   It's...
[02:21:10.940 --> 02:21:11.940]   Any gin mills?
[02:21:11.940 --> 02:21:12.940]   I think I went to hen house last night.
[02:21:12.940 --> 02:21:13.940]   Yes.
[02:21:13.940 --> 02:21:15.780]   I think I went to the gym right?
[02:21:15.780 --> 02:21:17.580]   You can send me some gin, Leo.
[02:21:17.580 --> 02:21:18.580]   Is that what you...
[02:21:18.580 --> 02:21:19.580]   Well, I'm thinking...
[02:21:19.580 --> 02:21:21.540]   I'm thinking for host gifts.
[02:21:21.540 --> 02:21:22.540]   You like gin?
[02:21:22.540 --> 02:21:23.540]   I love gin.
[02:21:23.540 --> 02:21:24.980]   Or you come into my house?
[02:21:24.980 --> 02:21:28.980]   Imagine the show with Stacey and I are both on gin.
[02:21:28.980 --> 02:21:30.620]   Wow.
[02:21:30.620 --> 02:21:31.620]   So this is...
[02:21:31.620 --> 02:21:32.620]   Maybe we'll get...
[02:21:32.620 --> 02:21:36.260]   I don't know if they have a variety of distilled spirits.
[02:21:36.260 --> 02:21:37.260]   Yes, they have gin.
[02:21:37.260 --> 02:21:38.260]   They do have one.
[02:21:38.260 --> 02:21:39.260]   Griffo Gin.
[02:21:39.260 --> 02:21:40.260]   All right.
[02:21:40.260 --> 02:21:43.220]   We'll get you some local, some Petaluma gin.
[02:21:43.220 --> 02:21:44.220]   That's gonna be good.
[02:21:44.220 --> 02:21:45.220]   Petaluma gin.
[02:21:45.220 --> 02:21:46.220]   Mmm.
[02:21:46.220 --> 02:21:47.220]   Mmm.
[02:21:47.220 --> 02:21:48.220]   Mmm.
[02:21:48.220 --> 02:21:49.220]   Mmm.
[02:21:49.220 --> 02:21:50.220]   Yum, yum, yum.
[02:21:50.220 --> 02:21:52.220]   Um, do you have a pic?
[02:21:52.220 --> 02:21:54.860]   If I had any chance, I know we threw you on the show at the last minute.
[02:21:54.860 --> 02:21:55.940]   You don't have to have a pic.
[02:21:55.940 --> 02:21:56.940]   I do have a pic.
[02:21:56.940 --> 02:21:57.940]   Okay.
[02:21:57.940 --> 02:22:01.700]   Um, I know we talked about Google's recovery story.
[02:22:01.700 --> 02:22:02.700]   Yes.
[02:22:02.700 --> 02:22:07.100]   But September is also Childhood Cancer Awareness Month.
[02:22:07.100 --> 02:22:14.580]   So if you folks could be so kind to check out the Sink Jude website and I'll look at the
[02:22:14.580 --> 02:22:21.580]   ways that you can give to help support and raise awareness and raise some money for research
[02:22:21.580 --> 02:22:24.220]   to help nip this thing in the bud.
[02:22:24.220 --> 02:22:25.700]   That's nice.
[02:22:25.700 --> 02:22:26.700]   That is my pic.
[02:22:26.700 --> 02:22:27.700]   That's nice.
[02:22:27.700 --> 02:22:28.700]   A good pic.
[02:22:28.700 --> 02:22:29.700]   You're a good person.
[02:22:29.700 --> 02:22:30.700]   I have my moment.
[02:22:30.700 --> 02:22:33.900]   Most of us pick things that we can spend money on for ourselves.
[02:22:33.900 --> 02:22:40.740]   I really like that you're bringing, last week it was mental health awareness.
[02:22:40.740 --> 02:22:42.220]   I think this is your groove.
[02:22:42.220 --> 02:22:45.740]   I think the goodness groove.
[02:22:45.740 --> 02:22:46.740]   I don't know man.
[02:22:46.740 --> 02:22:47.740]   I have my moment.
[02:22:47.740 --> 02:22:50.180]   You know, it's so funny because we had a priest work here for years and he never did
[02:22:50.180 --> 02:22:51.180]   that.
[02:22:51.180 --> 02:22:52.180]   Yeah.
[02:22:52.180 --> 02:22:53.180]   [laughter]
[02:22:53.180 --> 02:23:00.660]   Although I was looking at our guard, our security guard, our front Mo, great guy.
[02:23:00.660 --> 02:23:05.580]   And Mo does carry a sidearm as well as Mace because he prepares what it is.
[02:23:05.580 --> 02:23:08.100]   But then I noticed there was a rather large nerf weapon next to him.
[02:23:08.100 --> 02:23:09.820]   I said, do you use that too?
[02:23:09.820 --> 02:23:14.100]   His father Robert left me that when he left was his gift.
[02:23:14.100 --> 02:23:16.100]   Jeff Jarvis, pick of the week.
[02:23:16.100 --> 02:23:17.740]   So I got two things.
[02:23:17.740 --> 02:23:21.020]   Stacy, first of all, you bought the Pixel 3, right?
[02:23:21.020 --> 02:23:22.020]   The 3A.
[02:23:22.020 --> 02:23:23.020]   3A.
[02:23:23.020 --> 02:23:24.020]   The type of...
[02:23:24.020 --> 02:23:25.020]   3A.
[02:23:25.020 --> 02:23:26.020]   Oh, okay.
[02:23:26.020 --> 02:23:27.020]   So the...
[02:23:27.020 --> 02:23:28.020]   Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[02:23:28.020 --> 02:23:29.020]   P-P view here.
[02:23:29.020 --> 02:23:33.460]   It's now, of course, in advance of the next announcement, 50% off.
[02:23:33.460 --> 02:23:34.460]   Nice.
[02:23:34.460 --> 02:23:35.460]   It's been pretty cheap.
[02:23:35.460 --> 02:23:36.460]   Or about 50% off.
[02:23:36.460 --> 02:23:38.900]   Yeah, they've been cut to 200 bucks pretty regularly.
[02:23:38.900 --> 02:23:39.900]   Yeah, they...
[02:23:39.900 --> 02:23:42.500]   I know this is $4.99 for the 3, $5.99.
[02:23:42.500 --> 02:23:44.820]   It's not 50% for the 3XL.
[02:23:44.820 --> 02:23:45.820]   So that's not my...
[02:23:45.820 --> 02:23:49.500]   So my number this week is two.
[02:23:49.500 --> 02:23:53.180]   A chair with two legs, the stupidest thing you've ever seen.
[02:23:53.180 --> 02:23:55.340]   I think this is great.
[02:23:55.340 --> 02:23:56.340]   What the...
[02:23:56.340 --> 02:23:58.980]   This is only white men could think they could get away with wearing this.
[02:23:58.980 --> 02:24:01.980]   What is it?
[02:24:01.980 --> 02:24:02.980]   Oh my God.
[02:24:02.980 --> 02:24:04.980]   This is a wearable chair.
[02:24:04.980 --> 02:24:05.980]   Oh, man.
[02:24:05.980 --> 02:24:08.020]   This is from the Tech Insider Twitter account.
[02:24:08.020 --> 02:24:10.980]   A wearable chair that will allow you to sit anywhere except...
[02:24:10.980 --> 02:24:14.820]   You got these weird metal things hanging from your butt.
[02:24:14.820 --> 02:24:16.820]   This guy walking down the street with a self-satisfied...
[02:24:16.820 --> 02:24:18.060]   Hey, I got a metal chair.
[02:24:18.060 --> 02:24:19.060]   Where he is chair.
[02:24:19.060 --> 02:24:20.060]   My butt chair.
[02:24:20.060 --> 02:24:21.060]   Look at that.
[02:24:21.060 --> 02:24:23.100]   Don't worry about standing on that bus, my friend.
[02:24:23.100 --> 02:24:25.100]   You've got a chair built into your butt.
[02:24:25.100 --> 02:24:26.100]   It's like...
[02:24:26.100 --> 02:24:27.100]   It's like butt skates.
[02:24:27.100 --> 02:24:28.500]   I'm going to throw him a bone.
[02:24:28.500 --> 02:24:29.500]   Okay.
[02:24:29.500 --> 02:24:30.500]   Yeah.
[02:24:30.500 --> 02:24:31.780]   I've done shoots in the past.
[02:24:31.780 --> 02:24:33.220]   Oh, where you wish you had a chair.
[02:24:33.220 --> 02:24:37.660]   Yeah, and there's a couple of times I would have like a little plastic foot stool or something.
[02:24:37.660 --> 02:24:40.100]   You can get walking sticks that turn into stools.
[02:24:40.100 --> 02:24:41.100]   No, that's the reason.
[02:24:41.100 --> 02:24:42.820]   I would use it for something like that.
[02:24:42.820 --> 02:24:43.820]   I'm not going to walk the street.
[02:24:43.820 --> 02:24:45.820]   Oh, I want to picture that a little bit.
[02:24:45.820 --> 02:24:46.820]   No.
[02:24:46.820 --> 02:24:47.820]   You need your...
[02:24:47.820 --> 02:24:50.780]   Like if you need your hands free, I mean, because a walking stick chair...
[02:24:50.780 --> 02:24:53.420]   And okay, I'm going to throw this out there for...
[02:24:53.420 --> 02:24:57.700]   My mom had this condition where she didn't have any cartilage in her hip bones.
[02:24:57.700 --> 02:24:58.700]   And as it wore away...
[02:24:58.700 --> 02:24:59.700]   Yikes.
[02:24:59.700 --> 02:25:00.700]   I know that's healing.
[02:25:00.700 --> 02:25:01.700]   I have a replaced hip.
[02:25:01.700 --> 02:25:02.700]   Yeah.
[02:25:02.700 --> 02:25:03.700]   Yeah.
[02:25:03.700 --> 02:25:04.700]   So yeah, she's exactly.
[02:25:04.700 --> 02:25:07.180]   She was like 45 when she had her first hip replacement.
[02:25:07.180 --> 02:25:10.260]   And something like this is actually really helpful.
[02:25:10.260 --> 02:25:11.900]   This would be good.
[02:25:11.900 --> 02:25:16.460]   So yes, it's ridiculous, but if it's effective...
[02:25:16.460 --> 02:25:18.740]   Just use it for, you know, when you need it.
[02:25:18.740 --> 02:25:20.740]   I'm not going to walk the streets with that.
[02:25:20.740 --> 02:25:25.380]   This video really needs audio to see how much you're clinking as you're clinking.
[02:25:25.380 --> 02:25:33.380]   It's better than a miniature pony service animal.
[02:25:33.380 --> 02:25:35.380]   Silicon Valley.
[02:25:35.380 --> 02:25:36.940]   But yeah.
[02:25:36.940 --> 02:25:46.180]   So my pick of the week is at hugging face, transformerhuggingface.huggingface.co.
[02:25:46.180 --> 02:25:49.620]   Get a modern neural network to auto complete your thoughts.
[02:25:49.620 --> 02:25:53.020]   Oh, I thought you were going to do image roulette, man.
[02:25:53.020 --> 02:25:54.020]   Image never met.
[02:25:54.020 --> 02:25:55.700]   It's even better.
[02:25:55.700 --> 02:25:58.420]   I can start writing.
[02:25:58.420 --> 02:26:04.380]   And in fact, let me tell me something to write.
[02:26:04.380 --> 02:26:10.580]   It was a dark giant stormy afternoon.
[02:26:10.580 --> 02:26:16.180]   And then if I want to get a suggestion, I press tab.
[02:26:16.180 --> 02:26:19.540]   And then I could add day when we were out, but I got out.
[02:26:19.540 --> 02:26:25.860]   Day in Beijing on May 3rd or day, I was feeling great and having a good time.
[02:26:25.860 --> 02:26:26.860]   Okay.
[02:26:26.860 --> 02:26:32.420]   Stacey was wearing her butt.
[02:26:32.420 --> 02:26:34.860]   I don't think I really don't want you to chair.
[02:26:34.860 --> 02:26:36.420]   Oh, fuck it.
[02:26:36.420 --> 02:26:43.900]   I had to ask tab her what happened to you, her about it.
[02:26:43.900 --> 02:26:44.900]   Her about it.
[02:26:44.900 --> 02:26:49.180]   Him to put it on my lap while I was doing that would be no.
[02:26:49.180 --> 02:26:51.100]   What happened to you?
[02:26:51.100 --> 02:26:53.140]   End quote.
[02:26:53.140 --> 02:27:05.620]   She said she had a little too much to drink and tab.
[02:27:05.620 --> 02:27:07.180]   It's not going to go well.
[02:27:07.180 --> 02:27:10.340]   The only way I could help was to ask.
[02:27:10.340 --> 02:27:11.340]   You know what?
[02:27:11.340 --> 02:27:14.260]   I'm going to pick that and then hit tab again.
[02:27:14.260 --> 02:27:22.020]   Remember to stop smoking and put a cigarette tab in my mouth.
[02:27:22.020 --> 02:27:24.020]   Period.
[02:27:24.020 --> 02:27:29.460]   And there's my short story written by computer.
[02:27:29.460 --> 02:27:33.620]   In a shocking finding, scientists discovered a herd of unicorns living in a remote previously
[02:27:33.620 --> 02:27:34.620]   unexplored valley.
[02:27:34.620 --> 02:27:35.620]   I remember this.
[02:27:35.620 --> 02:27:37.460]   This was the one we saw before.
[02:27:37.460 --> 02:27:40.780]   Even more surprising the research is the fact that unicorns spoke perfect English.
[02:27:40.780 --> 02:27:42.740]   So now you can find your own.
[02:27:42.740 --> 02:27:46.780]   The other thing that's cool about this is you don't have to use that particular hugging
[02:27:46.780 --> 02:27:47.780]   face NLP.
[02:27:47.780 --> 02:27:51.060]   They have other models you can play with.
[02:27:51.060 --> 02:27:53.060]   So if you're curious.
[02:27:53.060 --> 02:27:54.260]   Oh my goodness.
[02:27:54.260 --> 02:27:57.540]   Should I try GPT-2?
[02:27:57.540 --> 02:27:59.020]   Let's get some, let's select.
[02:27:59.020 --> 02:28:01.780]   Oh, you've got to do the same thing again to see how it's different.
[02:28:01.780 --> 02:28:05.060]   Well, I'm not in that much mood to do that.
[02:28:05.060 --> 02:28:06.740]   And I don't think anybody else is.
[02:28:06.740 --> 02:28:09.140]   But you can just keep hitting tab.
[02:28:09.140 --> 02:28:10.140]   Tab return, tab return.
[02:28:10.140 --> 02:28:12.940]   And the whole thing.
[02:28:12.940 --> 02:28:13.940]   Oh my goodness.
[02:28:13.940 --> 02:28:17.740]   We'll finish itself.
[02:28:17.740 --> 02:28:20.300]   So that's it for this week in Google.
[02:28:20.300 --> 02:28:25.660]   We've taught you how to write, how to drink and how to get Marvel characters in a special
[02:28:25.660 --> 02:28:29.420]   little box for Christmas.
[02:28:29.420 --> 02:28:31.740]   Thank you all for being here.
[02:28:31.740 --> 02:28:33.980]   Ant-Pruit, where can we find Ant-Pruit?
[02:28:33.980 --> 02:28:37.740]   Well, you can find me here at Twit Studios for some of us.
[02:28:37.740 --> 02:28:38.740]   Are you Instagramming?
[02:28:38.740 --> 02:28:39.740]   I am Instagrammer.
[02:28:39.740 --> 02:28:40.740]   Once you're Instagrammer.
[02:28:40.740 --> 02:28:43.180]   It is still Ant-Pruit.
[02:28:43.180 --> 02:28:44.180]   Same with your Twitter.
[02:28:44.180 --> 02:28:45.180]   Yes, sir.
[02:28:45.180 --> 02:28:47.060]   Anything else people could follow?
[02:28:47.060 --> 02:28:50.300]   I think it's a good way to know what you're up to is you go there.
[02:28:50.300 --> 02:28:52.100]   And when you announce the shows, you'll certainly announce it.
[02:28:52.100 --> 02:28:53.100]   Yeah, we'll announce the shows.
[02:28:53.100 --> 02:28:56.060]   But I do have a segment on Hot.
[02:28:56.060 --> 02:28:58.620]   So that's Twit.tv/Hot.
[02:28:58.620 --> 02:29:00.900]   That's our hands on tech product for your show.
[02:29:00.900 --> 02:29:06.500]   Ant and I are going to both review the new Sony A7R2.
[02:29:06.500 --> 02:29:08.500]   What, that's why you were playing with it.
[02:29:08.500 --> 02:29:11.180]   We're a new camera 61 megapixels.
[02:29:11.180 --> 02:29:12.500]   Ten-pound dumbbell.
[02:29:12.500 --> 02:29:18.620]   Which doesn't matter if you don't take the lens cap off Leo.
[02:29:18.620 --> 02:29:21.540]   Stacey Igenbotham is at Stacey on IOT.com.
[02:29:21.540 --> 02:29:23.420]   She does a great podcast with Kevin Tofol.
[02:29:23.420 --> 02:29:26.020]   Anything else you'd like to mention?
[02:29:26.020 --> 02:29:27.020]   Sign up for my newsletter.
[02:29:27.020 --> 02:29:28.020]   It comes out on Fridays.
[02:29:28.020 --> 02:29:29.020]   And it's free.
[02:29:29.020 --> 02:29:30.020]   And it's free.
[02:29:30.020 --> 02:29:32.020]   You can sign up at Stacey on IOT.
[02:29:32.020 --> 02:29:33.020]   I'm there.
[02:29:33.020 --> 02:29:34.020]   You should be.
[02:29:34.020 --> 02:29:35.020]   Yeah, I get it.
[02:29:35.020 --> 02:29:36.020]   I love it.
[02:29:36.020 --> 02:29:41.940]   It's Professor of Journalism at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism.
[02:29:41.940 --> 02:29:44.420]   He's at Buzzmachine.com.
[02:29:44.420 --> 02:29:49.740]   He's at Jeff Jarvis and he's also on Medium where you can read his very long submission.
[02:29:49.740 --> 02:29:55.580]   Stopia for his 2032 class.
[02:29:55.580 --> 02:29:56.580]   We do this week in Google.
[02:29:56.580 --> 02:29:59.620]   Wednesday is 130 Pacific 430 Eastern 2030 UTC.
[02:29:59.620 --> 02:30:02.940]   If you want to watch live Twit.tv/live you can listen live there too.
[02:30:02.940 --> 02:30:05.820]   You can even ask your Amazon Echo just listen to Twit Live.
[02:30:05.820 --> 02:30:07.340]   It should play the shows.
[02:30:07.340 --> 02:30:09.540]   Whatever's on live right now.
[02:30:09.540 --> 02:30:12.660]   If you're doing that though, go to the chat room because they're watching and typing
[02:30:12.660 --> 02:30:13.660]   while they're listening.
[02:30:13.660 --> 02:30:15.420]   They don't use neural nets.
[02:30:15.420 --> 02:30:18.180]   It comes out of their own noggin there.
[02:30:18.180 --> 02:30:20.620]   Just go to irc.twit.tv.
[02:30:20.620 --> 02:30:23.740]   Although I have to say in a way they are my neural net.
[02:30:23.740 --> 02:30:28.420]   I have trained them over the years over decades of listening to me.
[02:30:28.420 --> 02:30:32.300]   So now they complete my sentences for me and they do a much better job by the way.
[02:30:32.300 --> 02:30:33.500]   Much better jokes.
[02:30:33.500 --> 02:30:34.500]   Much better jokes.
[02:30:34.500 --> 02:30:36.820]   I get all my good jokes from the chat room.
[02:30:36.820 --> 02:30:41.140]   If you want on-demand versions of the show go to Twit.tv/twig.
[02:30:41.140 --> 02:30:42.740]   Best thing to do though.
[02:30:42.740 --> 02:30:46.420]   Subscribe in your favorite podcast application that way you'll get it.
[02:30:46.420 --> 02:30:50.420]   The minute our editors are finished cleaning it up.
[02:30:50.420 --> 02:30:54.180]   Removing all the swear words that kind of thing.
[02:30:54.180 --> 02:30:55.900]   Thank you so much for joining us today.
[02:30:55.900 --> 02:30:56.900]   Hope you had a good time.
[02:30:56.900 --> 02:30:59.500]   We'll see you next week on This Week in Google.
[02:30:59.500 --> 02:30:59.900]   Bye-bye.
[02:30:59.900 --> 02:31:02.480]   (bright music)
[02:31:02.480 --> 02:31:05.060]   (upbeat music)
[02:31:05.060 --> 02:31:07.640]   (upbeat music)
[02:31:07.640 --> 02:31:10.220]   (upbeat music)
[02:31:10.220 --> 02:31:29.200]   [Music]
