[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.640]   It's time for Twig this week in Google, Jeff Stacey.
[00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.400]   We're all here.
[00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:13.760]   We've got lots to talk about, including some surprising news from Baffalona that raises
[00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:19.440]   the question of where are the next, where are the conferences going, what's happening
[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:20.440]   at conferences.
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.120]   We'll also talk about a new phone or two from Samsung.
[00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:31.120]   On the end of an Android phone company, it's all coming up next on Twig.
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:35.600]   This week in Google comes to you from the Twit LastPass Studio securing every access point

[00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.640]   This is Twig.
[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:13.440]   This week in Google, episode 546, recorded Wednesday, February 12, 2020, the Carsten Doctrine.
[00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.360]   It's time once again for this week in Google to show we cover the latest from the Google
[00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.120]   verse, the Facebook verse, the Twitter verse, the media verse, anything you're not at verse
[00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.220]   to.
[00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:26.680]   It's Stacy Higginbotham.
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:34.200]   My goodness, from Stacy on IoT, the fine podcast, Stacy on IoT.com, the IoT podcast at GigaStacy.
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.040]   Hello, GigaStacy.
[00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.800]   Hello.
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.200]   You know Tree Planning Day was on Sunday.
[00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.120]   Did you plant a tree?
[00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:44.120]   No.
[00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.120]   Is that Arbor Day?
[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.120]   No.
[00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.200]   It's a Jewish holiday for tree planting.
[00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.200]   Oh, really?
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.200]   Yeah.
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.040]   Celebrate all the trees they plant in Israel, you know.
[00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.960]   That's Jeff Jarvis.
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.880]   God knows he's the Leonard Town Professor for Innovation and Journalism at the Craig Numbuck
[00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.240]   Graduate School of Journalism at the City of New York and Director of the Townites
[00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.880]   and if we're entrepreneurial, Duran Elzim at the Craig Numbuck Graduate School of Journalism
[00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.280]   at the City of New York.
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.280]   And by machine.com, it's his blog.
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:19.000]   He also writes a lot of books, including The Newest, which is in progress all about
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   Herguttenberg.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Gutenberg.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.800]   The Gutenberg Revolution.
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:25.800]   That's not your new book.
[00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:26.800]   No, no, no.
[00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:27.800]   I got them doing the business.
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.560]   Why are you writing a book if there's a whole bunch of books about it?
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.880]   I'm doing counter punch about how to make fonts.
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:34.880]   I'm doing.
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.680]   He's a reader, an inveterate reader.
[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.680]   More Gutenberg.
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:39.680]   Wow.
[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.720]   I got books all over me right now.
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.960]   Turn the page and look who's here.
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.880]   I'm going to turn the page on me.
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:47.880]   It's Pruitt.
[00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:56.040]   Pruitt is the star of Hands on Photography at Twitter.tv/HOP and is not a former TV guide
[00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.040]   critic.
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.040]   Nope.
[00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.600]   Which was one of the big selling points actually.
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:00.600]   At one point.
[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.480]   We're hiring you in.
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.660]   The Mobile World Congress Top Story Mobile World Congress Big Show Every Year Barcelona
[00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:13.660]   Spain.
[00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:20.660]   It's the place all the phone companies go to show off their new phones except no one was going to go.
[00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:29.660]   The GSM Association puts this show on every year has announced we're going to cancel a show.
[00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:30.660]   We're going to cancel culture.
[00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:31.660]   It's Mobile World Congress.
[00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:39.460]   Because I was looking forward to having my computer and my wallet stolen in Barcelona.
[00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.300]   Have you ever had your computer wallet stolen in Barcelona?
[00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.380]   I have not but my colleagues have multiple times.
[00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.540]   It's just a thing that happens.
[00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.540]   I've just been lucky.
[00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:51.780]   Were you going to go?
[00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.140]   No, I don't like Mobile World Congress.
[00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.260]   It's not as I-oh, it's not as I-o-t-ish.
[00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.220]   I think they never had a problem with it.
[00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.060]   Even though it's Mobile World and supposedly all about phones, it just seemed like another
[00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.140]   extension of CES to me.
[00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.700]   It was actually, it got bigger than CES.
[00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.540]   Remember about probably seven?
[00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.460]   That mission's a bigger.
[00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:19.300]   But seven years ago or so, maybe even eight years now, all of a sudden it moved from being
[00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:24.500]   a phone show to being like a, "I have something connected to the internet."
[00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:26.420]   And Facebook showed up.
[00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:29.580]   I mean, everyone was like- lots of stuff there.
[00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.100]   Well, not this time.
[00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:34.540]   So- Can you imagine the cost?
[00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:35.540]   They're just the losses.
[00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.740]   The losses to hotels and restaurants in Barcelona-
[00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.300]   Yeah, of course.
[00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.780]   People have already started canceling hotel rooms.
[00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:47.380]   They'll probably lose some of their deposits.
[00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.380]   So there'll be some- Your line canceling?
[00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:50.380]   Yeah.
[00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:51.380]   Jesus.
[00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:56.140]   And all of this because of the novel coronavirus, now known as COVID-19.
[00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:59.700]   Or as- As Carsten says, "Cov fever."
[00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:00.700]   Cov fever.
[00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:03.500]   I got a fever.
[00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:06.260]   I just kind of a shock.
[00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.580]   I also think it's kind of a bellwether for the future of conferences.
[00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.300]   We don't really need conferences.
[00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.180]   See, this was interesting.
[00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:19.060]   I was looking at what was happening when we prevent people from traveling and we interfere
[00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.220]   with the free range of goods.
[00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:25.900]   Things the economy slows down by quite a bit.
[00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:26.900]   So-
[00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:29.180]   Well, trade is good for a lot of things.
[00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:30.180]   Good for the economy.
[00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:31.180]   It's good for peace.
[00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:32.180]   And understanding.
[00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:33.180]   And understanding.
[00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:34.980]   And seeing people in other cultures.
[00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:36.140]   That's the one problem.
[00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:42.220]   I get the ecological argument against flying, but now more than ever we have to have connections
[00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:44.020]   with people in other lands.
[00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.020]   Mm-hmm.
[00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:48.780]   Well, the internet has made that pretty much useless.
[00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:50.940]   So futile.
[00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:54.940]   So I suspect that we're going to see a lot of conferences cut and go by the way.
[00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:58.980]   But everybody agrees that the only reason to go to conferences these days is to see people,
[00:05:58.980 --> 00:05:59.980]   to talk to colleagues.
[00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:01.580]   Who wants to do that?
[00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:06.580]   Yeah, but I guess there's still that small group of people that go there for the sales
[00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:07.580]   opportunities too.
[00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:08.580]   The networking side of it.
[00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:10.340]   They're not small.
[00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:12.180]   That's a huge like CES.
[00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:13.180]   That's who's there.
[00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:14.180]   Mm-hmm.
[00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:15.180]   That's what that shows about.
[00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:20.860]   But I think that's why CES continues when Comdex and other trade shows have gone, you
[00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:23.260]   know, Sebit, which is even bigger than Comdex.
[00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:24.260]   They ever receive it.
[00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:29.020]   They've gone because you know, but CES persists.
[00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:30.020]   I'm not sure.
[00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:31.020]   It was Comdex.
[00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:32.020]   I think they were Comdex.
[00:06:32.020 --> 00:06:33.020]   But it was too narrow maybe.
[00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:34.820]   The comments was tied to PCs.
[00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:36.220]   Yeah, it was too narrow.
[00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:39.260]   It was a field as was Sebit.
[00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:43.940]   So maybe, but so that's what's, I mean, honestly without CES I think a lot of stuff
[00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:47.220]   wouldn't get made because that's where you go with your prototype, your early product.
[00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:48.220]   Mm-hmm.
[00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:51.940]   You talk to dealers, you get a sense of whether they'd be interested in selling it.
[00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:53.980]   Dealers make orders of stuff.
[00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:55.900]   It's important for a commerce.
[00:06:55.900 --> 00:07:00.300]   So we people are just, I'll just irritants to the blood flow of commerce.
[00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:02.900]   Yeah, the journalists have to come to.
[00:07:02.900 --> 00:07:07.140]   Yeah, journalists are important too, I think.
[00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:08.140]   I don't know.
[00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:09.780]   Would you, I feel like we don't need to go to trade shows.
[00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:12.180]   Would you, do you still want to go to CES next year?
[00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:13.180]   I love it.
[00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:15.980]   It's a lot of work, but I absolutely love it.
[00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:16.980]   Yeah.
[00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:17.980]   It's horribly efficient.
[00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:23.940]   I mean, going to like Hanoverbessay or yes, because you get to see in one place,
[00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:28.340]   you can assimilate what people want.
[00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:31.540]   There's a value because it costs money to go to these things.
[00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:34.900]   So you can't just call someone up and be like, I just watched a product.
[00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:36.580]   It's really random and cool.
[00:07:36.580 --> 00:07:38.460]   So these people have paid money to get here.
[00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:40.020]   You can see it all at once.
[00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:43.100]   So you can spot trends, you can compare and contrast.
[00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:45.900]   I think it's hugely valuable and hugely efficient.
[00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:48.340]   Yeah, just a devil's advocate.
[00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:51.460]   Can't you get all that out of the press releases at home?
[00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:52.460]   Yeah.
[00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:54.340]   And the president, have you read a press release lately?
[00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:59.940]   But also, again, the whole network inside of it, being able to look at those PR people
[00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:05.780]   eye to eye and get a feel for, okay, I want to deal with this person going forward because
[00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:07.620]   you know, we're content creators.
[00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:08.620]   Right.
[00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:14.540]   And it's nice to have a good relationship so we can continue to create great content.
[00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:15.540]   And there are tons of like-
[00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:16.540]   So what was going to be-
[00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:17.540]   Go ahead.
[00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:18.540]   Sorry.
[00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:23.260]   I have questions, a PR release is nothing compared to like what you actually need to
[00:08:23.260 --> 00:08:24.260]   know.
[00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:25.260]   Right.
[00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:26.260]   You know, in terms of how something works.
[00:08:26.260 --> 00:08:28.980]   Where you learn things, both of you at CES.
[00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:29.980]   Of course.
[00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:32.180]   Why else would you go?
[00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:33.180]   So what were we going to learn at the-
[00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:37.860]   We learn the things that they don't want you to know because you can actually ask them,
[00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:41.260]   in their press release, they're just going to tell you what they want you to know about
[00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:42.260]   the product.
[00:08:42.260 --> 00:08:43.260]   You actually go and touch it.
[00:08:43.260 --> 00:08:45.740]   You can say, ask them, well, what about this?
[00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:48.500]   Is COVID-19, is this just hysteria?
[00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:49.500]   Yeah.
[00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:55.220]   And we're going to, like we did with the Spanish flu in 1918, a couple of months forget about
[00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:56.940]   it and everything will be back to normal.
[00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:58.820]   Or will there be a long lasting-
[00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:02.580]   The Spanish flu in 2018 was not just-
[00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:04.860]   The 2018 Spanish flu was terrible.
[00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:07.820]   It killed more people than World War One.
[00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:08.820]   No, no, 1918.
[00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:10.820]   We talked about the 1918 Spanish flu.
[00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:11.820]   Yeah.
[00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:13.340]   The 2018 really was just a blip.
[00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:16.340]   No, the 1918 Spanish flu, I know, but we forgot about it.
[00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:17.340]   Right.
[00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:18.340]   No, we didn't.
[00:09:18.340 --> 00:09:24.500]   I only mean in the sense that it didn't stop world travel, no conferences.
[00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:25.500]   I know.
[00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:26.500]   Nobody knows the 19.
[00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:30.460]   If the conferences had been canceled then, then maybe people as many people-
[00:09:30.460 --> 00:09:33.060]   Well, what's interesting about that is we didn't have the kind of-
[00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:34.300]   What's the fact of fascism in Spain?
[00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:38.780]   Yeah, we didn't have the kind of travel that we have today in 1918.
[00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:43.500]   In fact, the reason it spread was it was right after World War One ended and a lot of soldiers
[00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:44.860]   took it home with them.
[00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:47.700]   So it was an unusual situation.
[00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:48.700]   I don't know.
[00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:52.300]   I wonder if this will just be a little hysteria.
[00:09:52.300 --> 00:09:54.740]   Everybody forgets about it next year.
[00:09:54.740 --> 00:09:56.180]   Mobile World Congress continues.
[00:09:56.180 --> 00:10:00.460]   Or should we start worrying about- especially about the conferences held in winter?
[00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:03.580]   We dodged a bullet at CES and could it be easily?
[00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:04.580]   Right.
[00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:05.580]   It could have been a nightmare.
[00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:09.860]   There were a lot of Chinese companies, Chinese staff there.
[00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:15.060]   The COVID-19 started in October and November, so it could easily-
[00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:16.940]   Like it's a few weeks difference.
[00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:18.700]   We would all come home two weeks later.
[00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:20.820]   Are there any of the tech companies near one?
[00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:21.820]   Oh, yeah.
[00:10:21.820 --> 00:10:22.820]   The tech area.
[00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:23.820]   Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:24.820]   Absolutely.
[00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:31.820]   In fact, this will also impact American tech companies like Apple who build stuff in China.
[00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:32.820]   Right.
[00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:35.180]   Yeah, your kick starters will all be delayed.
[00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:38.380]   We're starting to see- That's a convenient excuse.
[00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:41.540]   Or delay that they otherwise would have been.
[00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:44.820]   Those dice- we're not going to send them to you this year either.
[00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:49.260]   But car production for certain lines has stopped.
[00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:54.340]   I think GM is restarting their line this weekend, last weekend.
[00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:55.860]   What day is it?
[00:10:55.860 --> 00:11:01.220]   I think- here's an interesting story that applicable to technology.
[00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:07.460]   China has launched a coronavirus close contact detector app.
[00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:11.380]   They're asking people to download it, Chinese citizens to download it.
[00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:17.460]   They will tell you if you've been near somebody who's had the virus, you might wonder how
[00:11:17.460 --> 00:11:18.940]   would they know?
[00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:20.460]   Well, they know.
[00:11:20.460 --> 00:11:21.460]   China.
[00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:23.500]   It is China.
[00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:29.060]   So they have all kinds of- they have different levels.
[00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:36.900]   For instance, if you were on an air conditioned train, everybody in the car had close contact.
[00:11:36.900 --> 00:11:41.860]   If you were on an airplane, everybody within a few rows of you had close contact, three
[00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:44.580]   rows.
[00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:49.460]   It's a really interesting and they know who was where, when, and where you were too, for
[00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:50.460]   that matter.
[00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:55.060]   All you have to do is scan a barcode and you scan a quick response code on your smartphone.
[00:11:55.060 --> 00:11:56.860]   They'll come and get you in the middle of the night.
[00:11:56.860 --> 00:11:59.060]   Well, and you in a camp.
[00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:03.300]   And yet I bet you, if it- I mean, honestly, if we had something like that here, would you-
[00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:07.940]   Pandemics are a classic case of individual rights versus group help.
[00:12:07.940 --> 00:12:08.940]   I mean, that's-
[00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:09.940]   Right, yeah.
[00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:15.940]   It's part of everybody's horror stories and like one man standing up for the rights
[00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:20.820]   of his community kind of setups because it is a classic tension.
[00:12:20.820 --> 00:12:22.860]   Tleifoid Mary.
[00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:25.260]   Right.
[00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:26.260]   Was that-
[00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:27.260]   Mary Mellon.
[00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:28.260]   Yeah.
[00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:29.260]   That was in New York, right?
[00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:30.260]   Yep.
[00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:31.260]   Yep.
[00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:38.140]   There were so many doctors in the 1800s that were like Tleifoid Marys with purple fever,
[00:12:38.140 --> 00:12:42.540]   like who didn't- who would give birth to babies or deliver babies and then wouldn't wash
[00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:44.420]   their hands and then would go to the next mom.
[00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:47.540]   And so they'd all- they were like Tleifoid Marys times a million.
[00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:48.540]   Did you wash the-
[00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:49.540]   So new.
[00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:50.540]   Did you ever watch the NIC?
[00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:51.540]   No.
[00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:52.540]   Oh my God.
[00:12:52.540 --> 00:12:53.540]   It's a-
[00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:54.540]   I'm gonna turn that.
[00:12:54.540 --> 00:12:59.300]   It takes place in a New York city in the '18 somethings.
[00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:03.540]   It's basically about the arrival of the invention of surgery.
[00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:04.540]   The nip?
[00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:06.660]   And they weren't really good at it first.
[00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:07.660]   Oh, right.
[00:13:07.660 --> 00:13:09.660]   Oh, I was thinking of Nip Tuck, but that-
[00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:11.780]   No, K-N-I-C-K.
[00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:15.020]   That was the nickname for the Nickerbocker Hospital.
[00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:18.300]   Clive Owen was the star of it.
[00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:21.780]   And it was horrific.
[00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:23.620]   Steven Soderberg directed it.
[00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:24.620]   It was horrific.
[00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:26.340]   It was 1900.
[00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:31.300]   But honestly, without this, we wouldn't have modern surgical techniques.
[00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:34.220]   It's just in the early days, as you might imagine, when they were first-
[00:13:34.220 --> 00:13:35.220]   With everything.
[00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:36.220]   Yeah.
[00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:37.220]   It was pretty bad.
[00:13:37.220 --> 00:13:38.220]   Right.
[00:13:38.220 --> 00:13:39.220]   With everything.
[00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:40.220]   There's a beginning.
[00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:41.220]   It was pretty bad.
[00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:42.220]   There's a- there are scenes in it.
[00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:45.460]   And yeah, I don't think they had modern hygiene yet.
[00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:51.100]   There were scenes in it where they had some sort of blood transfusion machine that at
[00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:55.860]   an intern would have to crank by hand to keep it running.
[00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:58.420]   Ooh, it was all pretty bad.
[00:13:58.420 --> 00:14:02.940]   Anyway, if you want to feel good about what we've got today compared to that, that's a-
[00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:04.780]   Can I ask a geeky question?
[00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:05.780]   Sure.
[00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:08.940]   What were we expecting at Mobile World Congress?
[00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:10.820]   Aren't phones just all the same now?
[00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:11.820]   Well, okay.
[00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:12.820]   Do we really serve?
[00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:14.820]   Does this kill that whole idea of getting in the workplace?
[00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:18.380]   I think this might kill Mobile World Congress because it isn't as necessary.
[00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:22.100]   In fact, to that point, Samsung yesterday had an event announcing their new phone.
[00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:23.660]   They didn't feel like they had to wait.
[00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:26.860]   In fact, they specifically didn't want to wait until Mobile World Congress.
[00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:30.260]   It's only smaller companies that need MWC to announce phones, right?
[00:14:30.260 --> 00:14:35.460]   Well, Samsung hasn't been doing anything over there for a while anyway, so it doesn't
[00:14:35.460 --> 00:14:36.740]   matter to them.
[00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:39.020]   Microsoft wasn't going to go.
[00:14:39.020 --> 00:14:41.180]   LG wasn't going to go.
[00:14:41.180 --> 00:14:42.980]   Media tech, the chip company wasn't going to go.
[00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:46.460]   I mean, the drop app, at least the drop app, was Sony.
[00:14:46.460 --> 00:14:49.420]   Yeah, they didn't go because of the coronavirus.
[00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:50.420]   Because it wasn't like-
[00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:54.020]   Yeah. I think also it didn't hurt that they didn't need to.
[00:14:54.020 --> 00:14:56.300]   The need to, right.
[00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:59.500]   They still have their clout without MWC.
[00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:00.500]   Right.
[00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:01.940]   So, is anybody announced like a-
[00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:02.940]   Rib spectacular!
[00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:05.180]   No, but I imagine that's the next thing.
[00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:06.460]   Well, we couldn't go.
[00:15:06.460 --> 00:15:07.460]   There was an announcement today.
[00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:09.220]   I don't think it's related.
[00:15:09.220 --> 00:15:12.700]   Andy Rubin announced that he was putting essential down.
[00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:13.700]   It's over.
[00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:14.700]   Wow.
[00:15:14.700 --> 00:15:15.700]   What was essential again?
[00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:17.220]   So, Andy Rubin invented Android.
[00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:21.500]   He created the company Android, was purchased by Google.
[00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:25.220]   He became a Google executive where he continued development of Android.
[00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:28.820]   We talked a lot about it a few years ago when he left to pursue his dream of-
[00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:30.820]   Well, let's discuss his leaving.
[00:15:30.820 --> 00:15:31.820]   Robots.
[00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:32.900]   And then left completely.
[00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:38.620]   He left, I think, involuntarily because of, you know, sexual-
[00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:39.620]   Eligations.
[00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:43.900]   With considerable allegations about sexual harassment, which actually seem endemic at
[00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:45.620]   Google, but that's another story.
[00:15:45.620 --> 00:15:51.260]   He received a $90 million payout, which really irritated a lot of Google employees.
[00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:52.260]   Yep.
[00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:53.260]   Took some of that money, raised more money.
[00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:56.220]   In fact, he created a billion-dollar company called Essential.
[00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:59.500]   The idea was to make a perfect Android phone.
[00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:01.100]   In fact, I bought that first Essential phone.
[00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:02.100]   It was a beautiful phone.
[00:16:02.100 --> 00:16:03.100]   I really liked it.
[00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:05.300]   And it had some interesting novel ideas that were going to be clamp on.
[00:16:05.300 --> 00:16:07.100]   The horror of the experience, though, right?
[00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:09.380]   Well, the thing that kept it from being a hit-
[00:16:09.380 --> 00:16:10.380]   No, I liked it.
[00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:14.220]   The thing that kept it from being a hit is that their camera app crashed for the first
[00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:16.220]   few months after it was released.
[00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:18.360]   So you couldn't take any pictures with it.
[00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:19.820]   They fixed that eventually.
[00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:22.220]   I gave mine to a father, Robert, but I actually really liked it.
[00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:23.900]   It was a little smaller.
[00:16:23.900 --> 00:16:26.460]   There were some nice things about the Essential phone.
[00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:29.900]   And he was also developing that extra little slim phone, too.
[00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:33.780]   Yeah, he had, remember, he announced, and there was going to be the Essential, too.
[00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:36.540]   He also, Stacy, was going to do a lot of home automation stuff, right?
[00:16:36.540 --> 00:16:39.620]   I remember the home automation, but that never happened, so...
[00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:40.620]   Never happened.
[00:16:40.620 --> 00:16:46.460]   Didn't you say that his departure and payout was the start of the entire movement of unhappiness
[00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:47.460]   inside Google?
[00:16:47.460 --> 00:16:48.460]   Absolutely.
[00:16:48.460 --> 00:16:49.460]   Well, I think that's bigger.
[00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:50.460]   Hey, what's inside Google?
[00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:52.460]   There were a number of other events.
[00:16:52.460 --> 00:16:56.900]   In fact, we really have to give credit to the woman who wrote the Uber memo.
[00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:59.100]   Yeah, they were on the same side.
[00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:00.100]   Inside Google.
[00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:01.100]   Inside Google.
[00:17:01.100 --> 00:17:02.100]   But I think that...
[00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:03.100]   That was one of many...
[00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:06.140]   That was the wave that swept through Google, and then you're right.
[00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:11.940]   I think that the chief issue in the MeToo movement at Google was Andy Rubin's $90 million
[00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:12.940]   pay-up.
[00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:15.540]   And now you have the head of HR or whatever they call it.
[00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:17.540]   She has left Google departing.
[00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:18.540]   Yeah.
[00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:19.540]   Now, wait a minute.
[00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:24.660]   I thought she just took a different role at Google, just stepped down from that HR leadership
[00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:25.660]   role.
[00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:26.660]   It's a case, I don't know.
[00:17:26.660 --> 00:17:27.660]   I thought she just stepped down to a different role.
[00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:38.060]   She's head of HR leaves into mulchuous times.
[00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:39.060]   It says...
[00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:40.060]   Vox says...
[00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:44.540]   Actually, Rico says she's quit.
[00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:45.540]   She, of course, was encouraged to quit.
[00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:50.460]   I'm not sure, but she became kind of the locus of a lot of unhappiness.
[00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:53.580]   She'd been at Google for 13 years.
[00:17:53.580 --> 00:18:03.260]   Instead of HR, she said she's stepping down to be closer to her family in New York.
[00:18:03.260 --> 00:18:09.420]   The fourth long tenured Google executive to step down in recent months, including Larry
[00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:15.860]   and Sergey, it has to be unpleasant to be at the head of Google with all of this turmoil
[00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:16.860]   going on.
[00:18:16.860 --> 00:18:21.220]   Yeah, see, when I first saw the report, I thought it was just stepping down from that particular
[00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:22.860]   role into something else.
[00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:27.940]   So my assumption was maybe she's just sick and tired of all of this stuff that's going
[00:18:27.940 --> 00:18:30.700]   on and she's having to take the weight of it.
[00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:31.700]   Who's to say that...?
[00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:33.140]   I think you're safe there, yeah.
[00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:36.620]   But Chai is doing anything about it, but now I see that this is...
[00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:37.780]   All right, she's totally gone.
[00:18:37.780 --> 00:18:41.300]   Sintar said over the past 13 years, Eileen has made major contributions to the company
[00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:44.500]   in numerous areas from media partnerships to leading our sales and operations in the
[00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:49.100]   UK and Ireland, leading our people operations team through a period of significant growth.
[00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:53.660]   She hired, oversaw the hiring of 70,000 new employees.
[00:18:53.660 --> 00:18:55.260]   She says she wants to spend...
[00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:56.340]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:59.460]   Look forward to her next chapter at Google, so that does kind of imply...
[00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:00.460]   Oh, right.
[00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:01.460]   Oh.
[00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:02.460]   Yeah.
[00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:04.340]   My husband and I have decided, she said, after six years in the road first in London now
[00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:09.640]   in San Francisco to return home to New York to be closer to our family, I'll be working
[00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:12.740]   with Sintar and Ruth to find a great leader for the people operations team.
[00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:13.900]   So maybe she isn't...
[00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:15.300]   It's unclear.
[00:19:15.300 --> 00:19:21.020]   This is also...look for a lot more of this sort of thing to happen in the next few months.
[00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:25.580]   This is the end of Larry and Sergey's people, the people that Larry and Sergey...
[00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:26.580]   Oh, that might be the case.
[00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:27.580]   Oh, okay.
[00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:28.580]   Yes, right.
[00:19:28.580 --> 00:19:29.580]   Yeah, that's interesting.
[00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:30.580]   The people that...
[00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:32.580]   Yes, Sintar might be bringing his people.
[00:19:32.580 --> 00:19:33.580]   What happened to Carson?
[00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:34.580]   Carson came.
[00:19:34.580 --> 00:19:36.060]   Yeah, I was just about to say, where's my Carson came?
[00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:38.780]   We don't have enough inputs for Carson.
[00:19:38.780 --> 00:19:39.980]   B.S.
[00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:41.980]   We could do the Carson came.
[00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:42.980]   B.S.
[00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:43.980]   B.S.
[00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:45.980]   Carson, you're gonna make good points.
[00:19:45.980 --> 00:19:46.980]   You're gonna make good points.
[00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:48.380]   You're gonna find your pace, John.
[00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:49.940]   I wanna do like Letterman did.
[00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:53.860]   We should just strap a camera to Carson's head like the monkey cam.
[00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:55.420]   And Carson could run around the studio.
[00:19:55.420 --> 00:19:56.420]   That'll work.
[00:19:56.420 --> 00:20:00.700]   But then we wouldn't see you Carson, we just see everybody else.
[00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:01.900]   So yeah, unclear.
[00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:09.220]   But yeah, I'm not sure I would draw a huge amount of conclusions from this.
[00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:11.140]   Because it could be all of the above, right?
[00:20:11.140 --> 00:20:12.140]   Right.
[00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:15.340]   But think about, somebody's been at Google for 13 years, probably has some significant
[00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:16.340]   stock options.
[00:20:16.340 --> 00:20:17.340]   Oh, yeah.
[00:20:17.340 --> 00:20:20.340]   You're probably gonna say some significant trauma.
[00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:24.500]   And I'm not sure they probably need a break.
[00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:27.900]   Has Google mishandled HR over the last 13 years?
[00:20:27.900 --> 00:20:33.260]   I would hate to be in charge of HR at a tech company.
[00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:36.300]   One, it's utterly devalued.
[00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:44.820]   You're basically dealing with all of these people who people skills are not their forte.
[00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:49.580]   And it's not something they're, again, not valued.
[00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:53.340]   So I think it would be like just an exercise in futility and bashing your head against
[00:20:53.340 --> 00:20:54.340]   the wall.
[00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:58.780]   I mean, think about the changes over time, right?
[00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:01.460]   When Google started, you had to go to a top school.
[00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:03.740]   You had to have mondo grades.
[00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:06.260]   Then they did all this data stuff and they realized, oh, no.
[00:21:06.260 --> 00:21:07.260]   You actually don't need that.
[00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:08.260]   You just need to be smart.
[00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:11.100]   And they did all those stupid tests and they stopped doing that.
[00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:15.700]   And then they had all these things about how your life is different and this and that.
[00:21:15.700 --> 00:21:19.300]   And they made themselves into the perfect place to work, which for a long time, people
[00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:22.220]   generally, I guess, I've got to seem fairly happy.
[00:21:22.220 --> 00:21:23.220]   Right.
[00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:26.380]   But it was always far more regimented than we know one friend of mine who left there
[00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:29.140]   said it is exactly like the Marines.
[00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:30.140]   Oh, wow.
[00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:31.140]   That it is.
[00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:32.380]   It is that regimented.
[00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:35.020]   I think people have frustration obviously with any big company.
[00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:39.420]   The bigger it gets, the less voice you have, the harder it is to get things done.
[00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:45.060]   And so that problem of getting too big to be innovative, which Eric Schmidt always said
[00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:49.460]   was their biggest problem, comes down hard on an HR, the problem I think, is what can
[00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:50.780]   you do about it?
[00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:57.580]   I've had some previous leaders that were at larger companies like HP and the likes of
[00:21:57.580 --> 00:21:58.860]   that size.
[00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:03.300]   And they all pretty much said the same thing far as with it being so structured and rigid
[00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:05.860]   on the IT side of things.
[00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:10.780]   But it makes sense because you have these processes and procedures in place to not only
[00:22:10.780 --> 00:22:13.660]   protect you, but also protect the company too.
[00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:15.540]   Think about the counter example.
[00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:23.140]   Let's say somebody like Equifax, who nobody got around updating their Apache server software
[00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:28.860]   for six months and then they got bit by as it turns out, we've now, well, gosh, we live
[00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:31.180]   in a tough age for news.
[00:22:31.180 --> 00:22:37.980]   Because according to law enforcement in the federal government, it was the Chinese that
[00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:38.980]   hacked Equifax.
[00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:41.100]   Oh, I didn't see that.
[00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:42.100]   Yeah.
[00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:43.100]   The PLA.
[00:22:43.100 --> 00:22:45.580]   The PLA, they indicted three PLA.
[00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:50.220]   That's the people's liberation army.
[00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:51.740]   Were they officers?
[00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:52.740]   Probably.
[00:22:52.740 --> 00:22:57.820]   Hackers would probably be the other term to use for hacking into Equifax.
[00:22:57.820 --> 00:23:06.940]   And according to our intelligence authorities, that Equifax joins Anthem, big medical provider,
[00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:09.620]   and they even think the Marriott hack was Chinese.
[00:23:09.620 --> 00:23:13.540]   And one of the pieces of evidence for that is none of that data has ever emerged on the
[00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:15.860]   dark net.
[00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:16.860]   And if it were--
[00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:18.140]   What was their use for?
[00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:19.140]   Yeah.
[00:23:19.140 --> 00:23:20.140]   Wow.
[00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:21.140]   Well, that's a good--
[00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:22.140]   No, that's a great question.
[00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:26.220]   So instead of selling it on the dark web, which a hacker would do, what is the Chinese
[00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:31.340]   military doing hacking these places where you would get lots of information about people's
[00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:33.660]   movements, purchases?
[00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:34.660]   Go ahead.
[00:23:34.660 --> 00:23:35.660]   Get it.
[00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:36.820]   What's your speculation, Stacey?
[00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:43.540]   They're trying to find both relationships that they can use offensively to target government
[00:23:43.540 --> 00:23:46.420]   people or industrial people they want.
[00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:50.100]   So for really good spearfishing attacks.
[00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:53.860]   And then they're also trying to understand where these people are in time and space.
[00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:56.200]   It's basically digital spying.
[00:23:56.200 --> 00:24:00.020]   It's really what Google and Facebook and Amazon are doing.
[00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:01.620]   It is exactly what they do.
[00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:02.620]   Yes.
[00:24:02.620 --> 00:24:03.620]   Except they're using it for--
[00:24:03.620 --> 00:24:07.920]   It's big data because it used to be-- you probably have to do this on a more retail
[00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:08.920]   way, right?
[00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:10.940]   Always find out what Leo's been up to and we can blackmail him.
[00:24:10.940 --> 00:24:14.580]   Now, you just get every database you can, the bigger the dossier, the better.
[00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:16.980]   And you can draw lines, make connections.
[00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:17.980]   He's gay.
[00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:18.980]   I could tell he's gay.
[00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:22.060]   Or he's-- he must be working at the NSA.
[00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:23.700]   He goes to McLean a lot.
[00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:25.180]   And we should follow him.
[00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:29.920]   You could figure all this stuff out using AI based on big data sets.
[00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:32.200]   There's a lot of business.
[00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:33.200]   There's no business.
[00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:34.200]   Well, what?
[00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:35.200]   No, I take it back.
[00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:36.960]   There's also a business value to it because--
[00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:37.960]   And I don't think you can--
[00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:38.640]   You're a espionage.
[00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:43.640]   You should never separate Chinese-- the Chinese geopolitical aims from their economic aims.
[00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:44.640]   They're one of the same.
[00:24:44.640 --> 00:24:47.960]   Yeah, but at an individual level, if they know that I stayed in a given Marriott, how
[00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:49.400]   do they use that?
[00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:51.600]   Well, it's these single pieces not that useful.
[00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:52.600]   Yes.
[00:24:52.600 --> 00:24:53.600]   Because they can get a pattern.
[00:24:53.600 --> 00:24:57.840]   And not merely get a pattern, but notice that every time Jeff Jarvis is in Washington,
[00:24:57.840 --> 00:25:02.940]   D.C., so is another person of interest.
[00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:05.460]   And they both have dinner at the same restaurant.
[00:25:05.460 --> 00:25:07.260]   And you know, I mean, it's an aggregate.
[00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:10.140]   And it's the same exact thing Google does in Facebook does.
[00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:12.640]   They do it on the behalf of advertisers.
[00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:16.060]   But you can imagine what the Chinese could do with this.
[00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:17.060]   So--
[00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:18.060]   It just seems like it's--
[00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:19.060]   I have a break up.
[00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:20.060]   Thank you.
[00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:22.700]   A few needles in a very large haystack.
[00:25:22.700 --> 00:25:27.200]   Oh, but-- OK, so Jeff, this is why you're not-- this is why you call this technopanic.
[00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:32.400]   But it's actually relatively simple to bring compute power to bear here.
[00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:34.320]   That's the key of having access to--
[00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:37.480]   I'm just trying to think of the payoff to them.
[00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:38.480]   Well, let's say--
[00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:39.480]   I think of the online--
[00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:44.200]   So they're not looking-- so they have their needle in mind.
[00:25:44.200 --> 00:25:47.520]   So they might be keeping their eye on someone that they think is a--
[00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:48.520]   OK, that's a buy.
[00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:50.400]   It'll start with the database.
[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:51.400]   They start with the goal.
[00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:52.400]   Yeah.
[00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:53.400]   It might be.
[00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:58.240]   But I would like-- wouldn't you like to know the five highest ranking government officials
[00:25:58.240 --> 00:26:00.700]   who are secretly closeted gay?
[00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:03.020]   Or-- I mean, there's blackmail opportunities.
[00:26:03.020 --> 00:26:05.140]   There's all sorts of things.
[00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:09.460]   I guess being gay is no longer-- thank God-- black maleable.
[00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:10.460]   Maybe it is--
[00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:11.460]   China is absolutely--
[00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:14.500]   Maybe it depends on the culture you're too dealing with.
[00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:16.460]   Maybe the federal officials would tell the truth.
[00:26:16.460 --> 00:26:17.460]   China in Africa--
[00:26:17.460 --> 00:26:18.460]   Well, they get published for it.
[00:26:18.460 --> 00:26:19.460]   That's right.
[00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:20.460]   That's right.
[00:26:20.460 --> 00:26:21.460]   Very well.
[00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:23.400]   In the pre-syncs of Washington, D.C., it might all--
[00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:29.880]   So let's say they want to go after a high Saudi official.
[00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:30.880]   There you go.
[00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:31.880]   Perfect example.
[00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:38.320]   So they would say, OK, he was in this hotel next to this guy.
[00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:39.320]   Imagine.
[00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:41.020]   And he went to dinner with this guy.
[00:26:41.020 --> 00:26:42.020]   Huge family.
[00:26:42.020 --> 00:26:43.920]   And he did this other thing with this guy.
[00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:46.520]   Maybe he and this guy are gay together.
[00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:47.520]   Hmm, right.
[00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:50.760]   Did you just say maybe he and this guy are gay together?
[00:26:50.760 --> 00:26:51.760]   Yes.
[00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:52.760]   Yes, I did.
[00:26:52.760 --> 00:26:55.820]   That was not the best way to say that.
[00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:57.500]   And by gay you mean that?
[00:26:57.500 --> 00:26:58.500]   I was like, I'm like--
[00:26:58.500 --> 00:26:59.500]   This is like--
[00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:01.300]   This we can do high in jolle.
[00:27:01.300 --> 00:27:02.300]   You have that.
[00:27:02.300 --> 00:27:03.300]   That's a gay together.
[00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:04.300]   Maybe they're in a relationship.
[00:27:04.300 --> 00:27:06.300]   Maybe they're in a relationship.
[00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:09.940]   A homosexual relationship with this other man.
[00:27:09.940 --> 00:27:11.940]   Not that there's anything wrong with that.
[00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:13.820]   Well, in Saudi Arabia there is.
[00:27:13.820 --> 00:27:14.820]   There would be in Saudi Arabia.
[00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:18.440]   So we can totally blackmail this Saudi Arabia official.
[00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:25.020]   I mean, I think if I'm Chinese government, I want every bit of data there is.
[00:27:25.020 --> 00:27:27.140]   Why should only Google and Facebook have that?
[00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:28.500]   Shouldn't we have that too?
[00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:29.500]   Every bit of data there is.
[00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:32.580]   We could do thousands of things.
[00:27:32.580 --> 00:27:35.180]   Anyway.
[00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:40.460]   And again, the problem-- this is where it's-- in a post-truth era, it really gets hard
[00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:43.460]   to make any conclusions at all.
[00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:49.480]   Because just as we've received information this week from the US intelligence that there
[00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:56.120]   is definitely-- we have definite proof that Huawei is spying using their telecom equipment
[00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:58.160]   to spy on us.
[00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:00.800]   But are they providing that proof?
[00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:01.800]   No.
[00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:05.800]   So I mean, I think I believe them.
[00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:11.240]   But that's the damage by the way.
[00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:14.600]   They're not trusting-- I'm going to get political for a second.
[00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:15.960]   I'll make it late.
[00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:20.960]   But after you see what happened yesterday with the Justice Department, how do you trust
[00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:23.080]   any investigation or pull back from?
[00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:26.560]   All this talk about antitrust and the big platforms now.
[00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:28.720]   I'm sorry, but it's immediately suspect.
[00:28:28.720 --> 00:28:33.960]   Well, team mobile sprint, being fought by all the state attorneys general, 20 different
[00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:35.600]   states.
[00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:37.080]   The feds have already approved it.
[00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:42.760]   The FCC said, OK, the FCC said, OK, the states are pursuing it.
[00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:46.120]   A judge just ruled this week.
[00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:48.920]   You know, prices probably won't go up.
[00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:54.080]   We don't really need competition between sprint and team mobile.
[00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:56.840]   You didn't prove your case, so I'm throwing it out.
[00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:59.040]   And now there is one last hurdle.
[00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:00.040]   The California PUC.
[00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:03.840]   Well, I don't think it's a very big speed bump, but there's one last hurdle to the
[00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:05.880]   team mobile sprint merger.
[00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:09.040]   Now, I'm not sure I completely disagree with the judge.
[00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:13.240]   I don't think sprint isn't the strongest company these days.
[00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:17.280]   I don't know how much competition they provide as the fourth carrier.
[00:29:17.280 --> 00:29:22.760]   I don't think Charlie Ergun and dish are going to become a fourth carrier.
[00:29:22.760 --> 00:29:24.560]   That's the premise, right?
[00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:27.280]   That, well, we're going to make a new one.
[00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:28.640]   So it's OK, boss.
[00:29:28.640 --> 00:29:33.280]   I think team mobile and sprint probably should merge purely from a technical point of view.
[00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:36.000]   So one company, but they've been trying to do this.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:37.160]   It's been a little while.
[00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:41.000]   Ironically, team mobile is owned by a Japanese company SoftBank.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.880]   And I mean, sorry, team mobile is owned by Deutsche Telekom, the German company, and
[00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:48.120]   sprints owned by a Chinese Japanese company called SoftBank.
[00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:50.840]   So it's kind of the new access powers here.
[00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:53.880]   If we could just get an Italian, maybe we could get all of Eddie involved.
[00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:54.880]   All of Eddie?
[00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:55.880]   Yeah.
[00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:56.880]   I don't know where I'm going with that one.
[00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:57.880]   There's nowhere to go.
[00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:00.880]   You're going with World War 2 access of evil?
[00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:02.960]   I'm going back to the World War.
[00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:04.480]   The World War 2, the tooth.
[00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:07.480]   So I listened to this book, which didn't look great.
[00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:12.840]   But Olivette Lederer, an author is Olivette Lederer sold for like $250,000.
[00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:13.840]   Oh my gosh.
[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:15.320]   And auction because of the author.
[00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:16.320]   Oh my gosh.
[00:30:16.320 --> 00:30:17.320]   It was a beautiful machine.
[00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:18.640]   Yeah, I loved my old Olivette.
[00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:20.520]   We talked about this last week.
[00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:25.380]   So back to anyway, we tied about 18 different stories into one conversation.
[00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:26.380]   Because I was impressed.
[00:30:26.380 --> 00:30:27.380]   That's what we do here.
[00:30:27.380 --> 00:30:29.800]   It was very nicely sewn up.
[00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:30.800]   Such a pro.
[00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:32.920]   Oh, one more coronavirus.
[00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:39.240]   Have you seen anything reliable on, you know, is the supply chain for Apple phones going
[00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:40.240]   to die?
[00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:42.680]   I haven't seen any stock impact on American tech companies.
[00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:45.280]   Everybody just mentions that, oh, it's going to be tough for supply chains.
[00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:46.280]   It's awesome.
[00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:47.280]   They also have a lot of supply chains.
[00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:50.440]   Yeah, they're talking about it on their earnings calls.
[00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:52.600]   So did Apple announce it?
[00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:54.200]   It will have an impact.
[00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:55.200]   Yeah.
[00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:56.200]   They did talk about this.
[00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:59.240]   Fox Con Factory is closed down for an extra week.
[00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:00.240]   Oh.
[00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:03.640]   So this is a very good article all the way China's coronavirus outbreak is affecting tech.
[00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:04.760]   This is from a few days ago.
[00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:10.520]   The outbreak shows that what impacts China impacts everything.
[00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:15.880]   Apple, Samsung, Microsoft, Tesla, and Google, Google closed, for instance, its offices in
[00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:21.440]   Hong Kong and Taiwan, as well as some Chinese offices, all have closed offices.
[00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:24.080]   Factories have been closed.
[00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:30.760]   Those head of people, Diderot Brian, said that offices and contact centers are expected
[00:31:30.760 --> 00:31:32.600]   to open next week.
[00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:35.880]   Retail store or re-openings are still being determined.
[00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:38.640]   The problem is, this is a kind of a moving target.
[00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:42.320]   And I think that until there's an all clear from the World Health Organization, you're
[00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:45.080]   probably not going to see the Chinese government.
[00:31:45.080 --> 00:31:47.240]   You're not going to see anything reopening.
[00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:52.160]   Is it really news that Google closed their offices during this time in Hong Kong or wherever
[00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:53.160]   it is?
[00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:54.160]   Well, yeah.
[00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:55.160]   I mean, it's worth noting.
[00:31:55.160 --> 00:31:56.160]   Yes.
[00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:57.160]   It's a lot of companies.
[00:31:57.160 --> 00:31:58.160]   A lot of companies.
[00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:02.840]   Pega-Tron, both have closed factories, potentially delaying iPhone and AirPod production.
[00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:05.760]   See, that sounds more like news to me.
[00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:08.280]   That sounds like what most of the customers are more like.
[00:32:08.280 --> 00:32:09.280]   It's Google.
[00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:11.160]   They can move the functions, right?
[00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:12.160]   Right.
[00:32:12.160 --> 00:32:13.160]   Good point.
[00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:14.160]   You can't move the physical.
[00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:15.160]   Right.
[00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:18.000]   Tangible devices is a different story.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:22.720]   Because of the way Foxconn and many of the Chinese factories work, where the workers live
[00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:30.000]   on premises in very tight quarters and dormitories all together, the government of China is blocking
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.120]   Foxconn from reopening its Shenzhen plant.
[00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:39.320]   Foxconn is independently keeping its Zhengzhou plant closed, pending government review.
[00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:44.360]   Zhengzhou is iPhone City, where the bulk of the world's iPhones are assembled.
[00:32:44.360 --> 00:32:48.920]   According to Bloomberg, Zhengzhou might resume limited production on February 10th, where
[00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:54.360]   this might hit badly is not the current crop of iPhones, but Apple was expected to announce
[00:32:54.360 --> 00:33:00.360]   new iPads and a new small iPhone SE successor in March.
[00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:05.200]   Those would be devices that these factories would be working really hard on.
[00:33:05.200 --> 00:33:14.040]   Some Foxconn factories, some Foxconn factories, stop making iPhones and start making face masks.
[00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:22.720]   Alio, given the trade war fears of the last year and a half with China, did a lot of these
[00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:27.320]   companies set up all heard of supply chains anyway?
[00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:30.680]   Yeah, I mean, that had been happening.
[00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:35.400]   Partly that's also because of trade restrictions in India and Brazil, for instance, Foxconn
[00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:39.000]   has to make iPhones in those two countries to sell them and those for Apple to sell them
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   in those two countries.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:41.640]   So the factories are there.
[00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:43.440]   But I think it takes a while to build a factory.
[00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:47.120]   Look how fast the factory in Wisconsin, the Foxconn factory in Wisconsin.
[00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:51.480]   I don't even think they've broken ground on that one yet.
[00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:52.760]   Maybe they never will.
[00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:58.040]   So I still think we're pretty dependent on Chinese manufacture.
[00:33:58.040 --> 00:33:59.040]   It's pretty...
[00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:00.040]   Oh, yeah.
[00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:01.040]   And it's so flexible.
[00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:04.800]   That's actually the story about from iPhones to face masks.
[00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:12.840]   As long as it can, it should be... we're screwed if the whole country breaks down because we're
[00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:13.840]   screwed even if...
[00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:14.760]   Yeah, you can move it.
[00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:19.680]   But if you move assembly to Thailand, you still have to get parts from China.
[00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:22.800]   You'd have to move the whole supply chain as well.
[00:34:22.800 --> 00:34:24.600]   This is a non-trivial thing.
[00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:29.040]   I mean, China's really the world's factory floor.
[00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:30.040]   And it's hard.
[00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:35.280]   They had to... if they were fearing a total... I mean, there were threats of major tariffs
[00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:37.480]   on phones out of China.
[00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:38.480]   Yeah.
[00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:39.480]   They had to have done alternative plans.
[00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:44.400]   A lot of stuff is starting to move to Malaysia.
[00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:47.400]   It's starting to move to India.
[00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:49.560]   Apple's talking to India.
[00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:51.520]   Apple's talking to India every day.
[00:34:51.520 --> 00:34:52.520]   Yeah.
[00:34:52.520 --> 00:34:55.080]   Well, India, you have to because they are starting to move to Vietnam.
[00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:57.400]   But this is something that's going to take years.
[00:34:57.400 --> 00:34:58.400]   Well, they talked about that.
[00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:00.400]   It's just going to move.
[00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:04.480]   Vietnam just doesn't have the capabilities that China does.
[00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:06.560]   And so there's a lot of training.
[00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:13.640]   It took years for Apple to turn China into the iPhone manufacturing mecca that it is.
[00:35:13.640 --> 00:35:16.040]   I mean, in fact, we've all benefited from it.
[00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:23.080]   A lot of the technologies that Apple developed in China starting in 2007 with the iPhone,
[00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:24.640]   that's where the drone industry came from.
[00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:26.960]   That's where so many other things have come from.
[00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:30.640]   The ability to make those quickly, easily, effectively, cheaply.
[00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:32.600]   So I think this is...
[00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:35.080]   I mean, think about auto manufacturing.
[00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:41.360]   How long it took that to move from America to China.
[00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:42.360]   That was decades.
[00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:46.120]   Tesla is posting a model for three deliveries saying one...
[00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:47.600]   That's a great factory.
[00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:50.560]   One to one and a half week delay.
[00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:55.600]   It plants a resume production in its Shanghai factory or supposedly was going to on Monday.
[00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:57.080]   I don't know if they did.
[00:35:57.080 --> 00:36:00.360]   I think part of the problem is that it's not a little bit...
[00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:03.320]   The coronavirus is a little unknown.
[00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:04.960]   And is it getting worse?
[00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:05.880]   Is it getting better?
[00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:06.880]   And so everything...
[00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:07.880]   It's spread.
[00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:11.600]   Yeah, all these dates are kind of moving targets.
[00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:13.520]   So yes, the answer is yes.
[00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:16.880]   Now, you know, who's not impacted so much by this?
[00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:19.920]   Samsung, which makes its phones in South Korea.
[00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:24.400]   They yesterday had a big event announcing new phones.
[00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:25.400]   Very excited.
[00:36:25.400 --> 00:36:29.600]   They talked a lot about it on L-Out Android last night, so I won't duplicate that.
[00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:34.840]   But I think despite all of the nice features and I bet you as a photographer excited about
[00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:40.960]   the S20 Ultra, and the most megapixels, the 100X zoom and all of that stuff.
[00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:46.560]   Yeah, and I'm not sold on the 100 megapixels, but the zoom is a nice feature.
[00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:52.080]   64 megapixels or 108 megapixels, the way they do that though is with pixel-building.
[00:36:52.080 --> 00:36:56.720]   Yeah, so these are really actually 12 and 16 megapixel cameras and they take multiple
[00:36:56.720 --> 00:37:01.600]   images to give it effective 108 megapixels or 64 megapixels.
[00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:03.280]   They're very expensive phones too.
[00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:04.840]   That's another thing that's kind of interesting.
[00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:07.200]   They started a thousand bucks go up to 1500.
[00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:11.240]   Samsung also announced a flip phone, which I can't wait to get.
[00:37:11.240 --> 00:37:12.240]   I'm going to...
[00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:13.240]   That was my question.
[00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:14.240]   I will go with that.
[00:37:14.240 --> 00:37:15.240]   I'm getting up.
[00:37:15.240 --> 00:37:20.640]   I'm getting up at midnight on Friday to order this and then I'm going to run over to Best
[00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:23.760]   Buy the minute they open to get the Z Flip.
[00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:27.760]   1,380 bucks.
[00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:32.600]   Those people were at the Samsung event yesterday and played with it were somewhat impressive.
[00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:36.040]   Yeah, seems like that's getting a lot better on this.
[00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:37.040]   Right.
[00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:38.440]   No, it's not.
[00:37:38.440 --> 00:37:41.440]   I beg your pardon.
[00:37:41.440 --> 00:37:42.440]   First of all, I love it.
[00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:44.000]   It could be like a little Smurf laptop.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   It's like this big and it can sit out because the hinge is diff so it could sit like that.
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:49.480]   Hold yourself up.
[00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:56.040]   It's flexible glass, not that soft OLED plastic that the other ones are using.
[00:37:56.040 --> 00:38:01.080]   Alright, so if money were no object and would you get one?
[00:38:01.080 --> 00:38:02.080]   The flip phone?
[00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:03.080]   Let's put it this way.
[00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:04.960]   If Leo would buy you one, would you get one?
[00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:06.640]   I would rather go with the S20.
[00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:07.640]   Yeah, you should get the S20.
[00:38:07.640 --> 00:38:08.640]   I'd rather go that way.
[00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:09.640]   Stacey?
[00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:10.640]   Because of the case.
[00:38:10.640 --> 00:38:14.520]   Well, we'll be getting the S20 Ultra as host of all about him.
[00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:15.520]   But we'll get you one too.
[00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:21.360]   If you don't want to get up early on Friday, Leo, I'll stand in line for you.
[00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:23.920]   The person knows he'll get the old phone.
[00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:26.080]   The flip phone sounds fun.
[00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:30.480]   I'm thinking I loved my clothes at the razor.
[00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:31.480]   The razor.
[00:38:31.480 --> 00:38:33.080]   It's made for people like you, Stacey.
[00:38:33.080 --> 00:38:34.080]   Fashion forward people.
[00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:37.880]   It's made for people with pockets like Stacey.
[00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:38.880]   Or purses.
[00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:39.880]   People with...
[00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:40.880]   Yeah.
[00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:41.880]   I love the idea.
[00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:44.200]   I mean, people don't have pockets for the S20.
[00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:45.920]   They've got pockets for the flip.
[00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:46.920]   Right.
[00:38:46.920 --> 00:38:47.920]   Yeah.
[00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:49.200]   And it's just the size of a pocket handkerchief.
[00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:53.360]   So the original Galaxy Fold and other folding phones are tablets that are folded up.
[00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:54.360]   Right.
[00:38:54.360 --> 00:38:56.480]   So their phone size, once they're folded up, are a little bigger.
[00:38:56.480 --> 00:39:01.840]   This is the size of a pocket handkerchief that unfolds to a normal 6.7 inch phone.
[00:39:01.840 --> 00:39:02.840]   Yeah.
[00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:04.400]   I like that.
[00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:08.240]   I'm very cautious about longevity.
[00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:09.240]   Mm-hmm.
[00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:12.440]   You should not buy it until I buy it.
[00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:14.000]   Oh, I'm not.
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:17.840]   Believe me, if I have $1,000 to spend, I'm going to buy something exciting, like a rowing
[00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:18.840]   machine.
[00:39:18.840 --> 00:39:19.840]   Ooh.
[00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:20.840]   Now you're talking.
[00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:22.840]   Well, I already have one of those, so I guess I can buy the phone.
[00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:25.040]   Well, actually, you can advice on that in a second.
[00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:29.160]   But let's do a long bet here.
[00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:30.400]   And how long do we give it?
[00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:32.560]   Six months?
[00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:35.240]   Is it a hot thing or a laughing stock?
[00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:38.640]   Well, Microsoft thinks it'll be a hot thing because in six months--
[00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:39.840]   You're doing a duo, right?
[00:39:39.840 --> 00:39:40.840]   Well, more like eight months.
[00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:44.160]   Microsoft has already said they're going to announce the duo and the Nia.
[00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:49.040]   One is a folding phone that's kind of the size of a--
[00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:50.840]   I like a--
[00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:51.840]   I've had many.
[00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:52.840]   Yeah, with two screens.
[00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:54.840]   And then one is a folding laptop.
[00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:57.840]   Windows laptops is 9, 2, 9 inch screens.
[00:39:57.840 --> 00:39:59.120]   And they're all in on folding.
[00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:01.240]   This is the latest thing from Microsoft, which is interesting.
[00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:05.200]   I think it gives you more screen real estate, which is why.
[00:40:05.200 --> 00:40:08.000]   Our phones have gotten so big in the first place.
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:14.640]   So I think if we can get it as long as the folding works and doesn't hurt the glass,
[00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:17.840]   then, yeah, I think that's a total-- it's not a fad.
[00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:22.000]   And that's why Microsoft will win, is where they're not dealing with the crease of two
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   screens.
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   Yeah, right.
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:29.160]   If you look at another industry that's dealt with this already, portable gaming machines,
[00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:30.160]   Nintendo--
[00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:31.160]   You're going to say paperbacks.
[00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:33.400]   But none of them are folding screens.
[00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:35.160]   They're both dual screen.
[00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:49.320]   They're-- but Nintendo hasn't made one non-folding portable gaming system in the past 20 years.
[00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:50.800]   And the switch is very successful.
[00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:52.720]   That's not folding, but it's very successful.
[00:40:52.720 --> 00:40:53.720]   Well, yeah.
[00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:54.720]   I think--
[00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:55.720]   It's totally--
[00:40:55.720 --> 00:40:58.920]   I really like the looks of the form factor.
[00:40:58.920 --> 00:41:00.600]   I think the potential is there.
[00:41:00.600 --> 00:41:04.800]   It's unknown how long the glass will last or if it will start looking creased and, you
[00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:07.840]   know, dirt will get into it and all-- there's all sorts of potential issues.
[00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:08.840]   That's why I'm going to buy it.
[00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:11.440]   I'm going to take the bullet and take the hit and I'll let you know.
[00:41:11.440 --> 00:41:14.440]   I will put my money on the Samsung before I put it on the Motorola.
[00:41:14.440 --> 00:41:16.920]   I completely-- well, are we already know the racers a flop?
[00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:17.920]   Yeah.
[00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:20.440]   I think the razor is more expensive.
[00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:24.480]   It's using plastic OLED and doesn't have the glass surface.
[00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:25.480]   They even warn you.
[00:41:25.480 --> 00:41:26.480]   There'll be creases.
[00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:28.480]   There'll be fuckers.
[00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:31.480]   And is that just the thing that would say why I break it?
[00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:33.120]   You know, say, hey, hey, yeah, now.
[00:41:33.120 --> 00:41:34.120]   I want to let you know.
[00:41:34.120 --> 00:41:35.120]   You have some creases.
[00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:36.120]   Who says this?
[00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:37.120]   This is Andrew.
[00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:38.120]   It's central.
[00:41:38.120 --> 00:41:41.440]   It says the Motorola razor is as useful as a dull razor blade.
[00:41:41.440 --> 00:41:44.440]   Pretty much that was the universal review.
[00:41:44.440 --> 00:41:48.920]   Interestingly, now no one has the phone-- at least the embargo hasn't been lifted if
[00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:49.920]   they do.
[00:41:49.920 --> 00:41:54.080]   Nobody's been writing about the Z Flip but the people who saw it at the demo room yesterday
[00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:56.400]   and spent half an hour with it said no.
[00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:57.880]   Maybe this is something here.
[00:41:57.880 --> 00:41:58.880]   Right.
[00:41:58.880 --> 00:41:59.880]   Some potential there.
[00:41:59.880 --> 00:42:03.240]   Well, it also requires software that understands the phone when it's half open.
[00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:05.400]   Google's Duo does.
[00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:09.080]   You know, that's the video calling program that is on Android.
[00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:10.080]   I love that.
[00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:14.520]   If you're on a MotoFlip-- and by the way, Google put this in Android some time ago.
[00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:17.240]   They've been ready for folding funds for a few months.
[00:42:17.240 --> 00:42:21.800]   So if you have the flip kind of like a little laptop, the top part will be video, the bottom
[00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:23.560]   part will be controls.
[00:42:23.560 --> 00:42:25.680]   So it won't split your picture in half.
[00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:29.000]   It'll have a little smaller picture, which means you could put it on the table and aim
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:32.640]   it at you as you would a laptop so the camera can be positioned.
[00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:33.640]   It's infinite, you know--
[00:42:33.640 --> 00:42:36.240]   And let you multitask on something else.
[00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:37.240]   Yeah.
[00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:43.760]   Google also made a YouTube player that this is a little less useful, has the comments
[00:42:43.760 --> 00:42:46.320]   or the chat below it and the video above it.
[00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:50.960]   But I want to work on a Twitter app that would play our video at the top and have a
[00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:51.960]   little chat room at the bottom.
[00:42:51.960 --> 00:42:53.440]   Ooh, I see at the bottom.
[00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:54.440]   Wouldn't that be cool?
[00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:55.440]   You probably wouldn't have a title.
[00:42:55.440 --> 00:42:56.440]   All right, here's another question.
[00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:57.960]   But you might be able to read it.
[00:42:57.960 --> 00:42:58.960]   Yeah.
[00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:01.080]   Will Apple ever have a folding phone?
[00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:04.120]   Why, I asked that yesterday, I'm at break weekly.
[00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:05.600]   Is this an Apple aesthetic?
[00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:08.080]   I don't think it is, myself.
[00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:12.120]   I think they're going to put their money towards a heads up display, personally.
[00:43:12.120 --> 00:43:18.120]   This feels like this type of screen real estate feels like a stopgap motion to putting
[00:43:18.120 --> 00:43:19.640]   the internet around us.
[00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:26.280]   I think if other people manage to make a successful flip phone, Apple will make a successful
[00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:27.480]   will make another flip.
[00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:28.480]   Oh, my God.
[00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:29.480]   That's a scary shot.
[00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:30.480]   See, Carson can.
[00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:31.480]   Carson can.
[00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:32.480]   Carson can.
[00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:37.480]   Are you in your mom's basement right now, Carson?
[00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:43.480]   We like Carson work at home one day a week.
[00:43:43.480 --> 00:43:50.760]   I think Apple has not made glasses yet because no one's made successful glasses yet.
[00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:51.760]   Right.
[00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:57.360]   Well, I do think they made the HomePod because other people made successful voice assistance.
[00:43:57.360 --> 00:43:58.360]   True.
[00:43:58.360 --> 00:44:09.680]   I think the HomePod shows that if Apple just does it because everyone else is doing it,
[00:44:09.680 --> 00:44:15.080]   as opposed to having some sort of quality vision, that it's not an awesome idea.
[00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:17.920]   I agree with you.
[00:44:17.920 --> 00:44:22.000]   We don't know yet if that is a new form factor for the phone that everybody's going to want.
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.800]   If it does become that, of course Apple will make one.
[00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:27.880]   Well, it doesn't have to be the form factor that everyone wants.
[00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:31.240]   What's nice about phones is now that you've achieved market saturation, you can start to
[00:44:31.240 --> 00:44:33.640]   differentiate between different.
[00:44:33.640 --> 00:44:35.480]   And Apple will always be a laggard there.
[00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:36.480]   They won't.
[00:44:36.480 --> 00:44:37.480]   That's Carson.
[00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:38.480]   It's annoying.
[00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:39.480]   They're not going to innovate in that space.
[00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:49.760]   I'm going to bet that I can make fun of you within a year.
[00:44:49.760 --> 00:44:53.160]   And what would you be making fun of before?
[00:44:53.160 --> 00:44:55.960]   So you're saying there won't be any more flip phones after this one?
[00:44:55.960 --> 00:44:58.600]   I think they'll be a wacky little...
[00:44:58.600 --> 00:45:01.480]   Oh, you think it's Google Glass, I see what you're saying.
[00:45:01.480 --> 00:45:04.040]   Well, it's certainly possibly the...
[00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:06.920]   These are all the next curved phones.
[00:45:06.920 --> 00:45:07.920]   Remember curved TVs?
[00:45:07.920 --> 00:45:08.920]   Remember curved TV?
[00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:09.920]   Yeah, they have.
[00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:10.920]   LG curved phones.
[00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:11.920]   Yeah, right.
[00:45:11.920 --> 00:45:13.720]   Nobody makes those anymore.
[00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:16.080]   Yeah, they made curved phones very briefly.
[00:45:16.080 --> 00:45:17.080]   I remember that.
[00:45:17.080 --> 00:45:18.080]   But that was a terrible one.
[00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:20.680]   Remember phones that used to have stuff you could do on the edge?
[00:45:20.680 --> 00:45:22.680]   Oh, yeah, it sounds so unblurged.
[00:45:22.680 --> 00:45:23.680]   Yeah.
[00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:25.680]   They still make that, but it's not quite as...
[00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:26.680]   Yeah, it's not as...
[00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:29.040]   I always turn it off.
[00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:30.040]   They still...
[00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:32.800]   That's still part of the Samsung UI, but I do turn that off.
[00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:33.800]   I don't know.
[00:45:33.800 --> 00:45:34.800]   I think it's not.
[00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:35.800]   Anything about that.
[00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:36.800]   Anything about it.
[00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:37.800]   Anything about it.
[00:45:37.800 --> 00:45:38.800]   At their thing for the S20.
[00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:39.800]   Here's the difference.
[00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:41.880]   I think you can make a strong case for the practicality of a folding phone.
[00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:46.120]   Instead of having something this big, I'm pointing at my iPhone.
[00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:49.360]   I have something half as big that I could put on my twice as thick.
[00:45:49.360 --> 00:45:50.600]   Well, it's a little thicker.
[00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:51.600]   You're right.
[00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:55.280]   Thickness is an unknown and the hinge is an unknown and the screen is an unknown.
[00:45:55.280 --> 00:45:58.640]   But assuming it's kind of compact and feels comfortable, I can put it in my hip pocket
[00:45:58.640 --> 00:45:59.640]   or...
[00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:00.640]   Here's the other question.
[00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:01.640]   It's opening.
[00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:03.640]   How much is it going to be a pain with one hand opening?
[00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:06.960]   According to the early reviews, it does not flip.
[00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:07.960]   The hinge is stiff.
[00:46:07.960 --> 00:46:10.880]   It never takes two hands to open it.
[00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:11.880]   Hey, see that?
[00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:12.880]   That right there.
[00:46:12.880 --> 00:46:13.880]   Oh, that's a deal killer.
[00:46:13.880 --> 00:46:15.880]   Oh, you want to do this, Star Trek?
[00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:18.320]   I'm going to open it with your mouth and your hand.
[00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:21.360]   If I can't be James T. Kirk with that phone.
[00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:22.360]   No way.
[00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:23.360]   It's a good point.
[00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:26.880]   Because you guys are strap hangers, so you're strap hanging on the subway.
[00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:31.880]   If I can't hang it up with a flip.
[00:46:31.880 --> 00:46:32.880]   Oh, yeah.
[00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:33.880]   Oh, you can't do that.
[00:46:33.880 --> 00:46:37.520]   I want to go like hang up with somebody just like that.
[00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:38.520]   No.
[00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:39.520]   Well, that's fun.
[00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:43.800]   But there is a practical point of like you have to be able to control your phone and work
[00:46:43.800 --> 00:46:44.800]   with it with one hand.
[00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:47.800]   You're going to all be jealous because I'm going to be sitting here next week with a
[00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:49.760]   nice purple flip phone.
[00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:52.600]   It's going to be sitting right here and you're going to say, "Well, that is kind of...
[00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:53.600]   I'll be jealous for about a week."
[00:46:53.600 --> 00:46:54.600]   But then I'll be laughing at it.
[00:46:54.600 --> 00:46:56.600]   I think it's going to be great.
[00:46:56.600 --> 00:47:02.240]   Isn't it fascinating though that we've gone from the original razor that was four inches
[00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:08.240]   flip to the candy bars that did not flip anymore to the bigger screen to the note being even
[00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:09.240]   bigger?
[00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:11.600]   And now we're saying the note's too big and we're going to flip them back down.
[00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:12.600]   I love the note.
[00:47:12.600 --> 00:47:15.960]   I bought the very first note I bought every note since because I like a big screen.
[00:47:15.960 --> 00:47:16.960]   The note was nice.
[00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:18.440]   This is a 6.7 inch screen.
[00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:22.560]   It's a little tall, but it's a 6.7 inch screen in a form factor the size of a pocket.
[00:47:22.560 --> 00:47:23.560]   Which I like that idea.
[00:47:23.560 --> 00:47:25.840]   It's an inch and a half bigger than the first note.
[00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:27.120]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:28.360]   I like that idea.
[00:47:28.360 --> 00:47:29.360]   But we want to fold it in here.
[00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:30.560]   I acknowledge there's unknowns.
[00:47:30.560 --> 00:47:32.160]   I don't know what the screen...
[00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:33.480]   Folding the screen is crazy.
[00:47:33.480 --> 00:47:34.480]   Is that going to work?
[00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:37.240]   Is the hinge going to be too stiff?
[00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:39.760]   Will software use this?
[00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:45.720]   But I think on the face of it, that form factor is sensible unlike a curved, freaking
[00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:47.640]   phone, which is just goofy.
[00:47:47.640 --> 00:47:48.640]   It's like a banana phone.
[00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:53.600]   Getting back to what you said earlier about Apple being in China and what it led to with
[00:47:53.600 --> 00:48:00.800]   other tech is interesting to see what could happen with this technology on other appliances
[00:48:00.800 --> 00:48:01.800]   and things like that.
[00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:05.120]   Samsung has been an accessibility, a sad story.
[00:48:05.120 --> 00:48:09.520]   Samsung decided they wanted to make folding screens a few years ago and invested hundreds
[00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:10.720]   of millions of dollars.
[00:48:10.720 --> 00:48:17.080]   Somehow it leaked out and the other companies like Royal and Huawei and Xiaomi started making
[00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:18.080]   folding for a real...
[00:48:18.080 --> 00:48:19.080]   Oh, it was nice though.
[00:48:19.080 --> 00:48:22.960]   Yeah, when they're using that technology, Samsung's pay hundreds of millions of dollars.
[00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:23.960]   Nice.
[00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:25.960]   Nice is an interesting phrase.
[00:48:25.960 --> 00:48:26.960]   You like the right...
[00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:30.840]   You saw the second generation of Royal.
[00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:31.840]   You liked that.
[00:48:31.840 --> 00:48:32.840]   Yeah.
[00:48:32.840 --> 00:48:33.840]   It did.
[00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:38.040]   But when it had a screen like ripples when you opened it because it has to have a little...
[00:48:38.040 --> 00:48:39.040]   It stretches right.
[00:48:39.040 --> 00:48:40.040]   Super thin.
[00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:41.040]   Yeah.
[00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:42.040]   I think...
[00:48:42.040 --> 00:48:43.040]   Where's my other fear?
[00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:44.040]   You're all going to be jealous of me, that's all I'm saying.
[00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:50.360]   It's a new jerky thing to do in New York is to stop and sidewalk because you've got to
[00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:51.360]   open up your phone.
[00:48:51.360 --> 00:48:52.880]   Oh, I freaking hate that.
[00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:53.880]   Keep moving people.
[00:48:53.880 --> 00:48:54.880]   Keep moving.
[00:48:54.880 --> 00:48:55.880]   It was like that.
[00:48:55.880 --> 00:48:59.280]   Yes, there were all these people looking at their phone moving a mile an hour.
[00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:02.480]   I want to hit them in the head.
[00:49:02.480 --> 00:49:03.480]   We need a thing.
[00:49:03.480 --> 00:49:06.480]   You know, like in Quaker churches where the guy, the beetle goes around and if you fall
[00:49:06.480 --> 00:49:09.200]   asleep he bops you on the head, I want one of those.
[00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:13.200]   What happens to people on the sidewalks now that stop and just look at their normal phone?
[00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:15.080]   I would assume in New York.
[00:49:15.080 --> 00:49:16.080]   No, they don't stop.
[00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:18.760]   They slow down to one mile an hour.
[00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:19.760]   I hate that.
[00:49:19.760 --> 00:49:22.280]   Aren't people like kind of nudging them as they walk by?
[00:49:22.280 --> 00:49:23.280]   I hope so.
[00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:25.280]   No, we're just growling at them.
[00:49:25.280 --> 00:49:26.280]   Okay.
[00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:27.280]   My time is...
[00:49:27.280 --> 00:49:28.280]   Do we...
[00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:29.280]   What you do with a car?
[00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:30.280]   It's like...
[00:49:30.280 --> 00:49:32.040]   It's what do you call heat driving?
[00:49:32.040 --> 00:49:34.040]   What do you call that?
[00:49:34.040 --> 00:49:35.040]   Road rage.
[00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:36.040]   Road rage.
[00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:37.040]   Yeah, there's sidewalk rage.
[00:49:37.040 --> 00:49:38.040]   So...
[00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:39.040]   Are you driving?
[00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:40.360]   What I do is I go, "Here!"
[00:49:40.360 --> 00:49:41.360]   Just to come go.
[00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:42.360]   I had a more round range.
[00:49:42.360 --> 00:49:43.360]   You cut them off.
[00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:45.080]   You cut them off, exactly.
[00:49:45.080 --> 00:49:46.080]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:49:46.080 --> 00:49:47.080]   Cut them off.
[00:49:47.080 --> 00:49:48.080]   So passive aggressive is what you're saying.
[00:49:48.080 --> 00:49:49.080]   Oh, I'm not passive aggressive, man.
[00:49:49.080 --> 00:49:50.080]   I am aggressive.
[00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:51.080]   No, aggressive aggressive.
[00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:52.080]   Do you grumble?
[00:49:52.080 --> 00:49:53.080]   In New York.
[00:49:53.080 --> 00:49:56.000]   When you're road raging them, do you go grumble, grumble, grumble?
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:00.040]   Oh, my kids used to hate me yelling at the camera.
[00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:03.200]   They can't hear you, dude!
[00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:09.160]   Get it up, get it up, get it up, get it up, get it up, get it up.
[00:50:09.160 --> 00:50:11.840]   Don't be sidewalk rage over this thing.
[00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:13.840]   Old man yells at the camera.
[00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:15.320]   There's already sidewalk rage.
[00:50:15.320 --> 00:50:17.000]   I mean, come on.
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:20.520]   But you're saying that as if a lot of units are going to sell.
[00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:24.760]   Oh, in Rich New York, where they want to show off to have this?
[00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:25.760]   You think so?
[00:50:25.760 --> 00:50:26.760]   Oh, yeah.
[00:50:26.760 --> 00:50:30.240]   This, there in L.A., there's going to be a lot of people with this phone.
[00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:31.240]   Okay.
[00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:32.240]   I have to.
[00:50:32.240 --> 00:50:33.880]   Many, many, many, many years ago when I was...
[00:50:33.880 --> 00:50:39.200]   One time I was on moonlighting, and I was at the Paramount Studios, and I got to go and
[00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:40.600]   have lunch.
[00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:44.600]   And I went in, this was way before the real cell phone.
[00:50:44.600 --> 00:50:49.520]   People had to carry a whole case that was this big with a handle and a tenet and all
[00:50:49.520 --> 00:50:50.520]   things.
[00:50:50.520 --> 00:50:51.520]   Back phones.
[00:50:51.520 --> 00:50:55.680]   They would walk into the commissary there, and that you know, just have their assistant
[00:50:55.680 --> 00:50:56.680]   call them.
[00:50:56.680 --> 00:50:57.680]   Right, of course.
[00:50:57.680 --> 00:50:58.680]   So they could be so important to this phone.
[00:50:58.680 --> 00:51:06.120]   I have a picture, actually, of Jeff yelling at somebody as he tries to walk around them.
[00:51:06.120 --> 00:51:13.120]   Get out of my way!
[00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:16.040]   I just figure...
[00:51:16.040 --> 00:51:18.160]   I just don't know that many units are going to sell.
[00:51:18.160 --> 00:51:21.800]   I figure boss man over there would be one of them buying it.
[00:51:21.800 --> 00:51:26.480]   That's why I'm going to the store at midnight, get in line for it, because they said limited
[00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:27.480]   quantities.
[00:51:27.480 --> 00:51:30.280]   I think that this is going to sell out.
[00:51:30.280 --> 00:51:34.240]   You're going to come back to me in a couple of weeks and say, "Oh, I think you're right.
[00:51:34.240 --> 00:51:35.240]   I want this phone."
[00:51:35.240 --> 00:51:36.240]   They're going to be too late.
[00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:37.240]   They won't be out.
[00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:38.240]   They won't be any more for months.
[00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:40.840]   Limited quantities could be like two at every store.
[00:51:40.840 --> 00:51:41.840]   I know!
[00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:42.840]   That's why I'm going to be in line.
[00:51:42.840 --> 00:51:43.840]   That's why I'm ordering them right away.
[00:51:43.840 --> 00:51:46.360]   I bet you this is hard to make.
[00:51:46.360 --> 00:51:48.880]   Yeah, I bet you're right.
[00:51:48.880 --> 00:51:49.880]   I'm just saying.
[00:51:49.880 --> 00:51:54.760]   I love that sarcastic look on the Stacy space.
[00:51:54.760 --> 00:51:58.040]   It also is the best selfie cam ever made.
[00:51:58.040 --> 00:51:59.040]   No!
[00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:01.040]   She's like, "Go on."
[00:52:01.040 --> 00:52:02.040]   Because on the other, no.
[00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:03.040]   On the flip side of it.
[00:52:03.040 --> 00:52:04.040]   Tell me more.
[00:52:04.040 --> 00:52:06.600]   Did you see the demo?
[00:52:06.600 --> 00:52:09.760]   You don't need a tripod anymore.
[00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:12.600]   You can put it on the desk in front of you.
[00:52:12.600 --> 00:52:15.800]   It's what we're using to light Karsten right now.
[00:52:15.800 --> 00:52:17.800]   Look, here's me.
[00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:20.640]   Here's me on my nice selfie cam.
[00:52:20.640 --> 00:52:22.520]   I don't have to go like this anymore.
[00:52:22.520 --> 00:52:23.520]   True.
[00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:24.520]   I've got Karsten cam.
[00:52:24.520 --> 00:52:30.520]   I want to see if I can find the Samsung image.
[00:52:30.520 --> 00:52:33.240]   I like that Karsten's embracing Karsten cam.
[00:52:33.240 --> 00:52:34.240]   That's good.
[00:52:34.240 --> 00:52:35.240]   I'm embracing.
[00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:36.240]   I can't shut them up.
[00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:38.040]   How do we demand?
[00:52:38.040 --> 00:52:39.320]   These aren't some new meds this week.
[00:52:39.320 --> 00:52:40.320]   I don't know.
[00:52:40.320 --> 00:52:42.040]   I am on some new meds this time.
[00:52:42.040 --> 00:52:43.040]   Very happy.
[00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:45.960]   How do you do that?
[00:52:45.960 --> 00:52:48.600]   This is extra B vitamins.
[00:52:48.600 --> 00:52:50.960]   You know, I had to cut back on the B vitamins.
[00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:51.960]   Magnesium.
[00:52:51.960 --> 00:52:53.800]   I'm all over the magnesium.
[00:52:53.800 --> 00:52:55.560]   Magnesium doesn't make you happy.
[00:52:55.560 --> 00:52:56.560]   It makes you relaxed.
[00:52:56.560 --> 00:52:57.560]   It makes you poop.
[00:52:57.560 --> 00:52:58.560]   That's a problem.
[00:52:58.560 --> 00:53:05.160]   I thought that I had a big problem.
[00:53:05.160 --> 00:53:08.440]   I was taking magnesium from my heart and the doctor said, "Have you heard of milk of
[00:53:08.440 --> 00:53:09.440]   magnesium?"
[00:53:09.440 --> 00:53:12.280]   Yeah, that's made out of magnesium.
[00:53:12.280 --> 00:53:13.800]   Cut it out.
[00:53:13.800 --> 00:53:15.400]   I was like months.
[00:53:15.400 --> 00:53:16.400]   I was taking some.
[00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:18.120]   My wife said, "No, no, no, that's the wrong one.
[00:53:18.120 --> 00:53:19.120]   That's a good one."
[00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:20.120]   You have to take this one.
[00:53:20.120 --> 00:53:21.120]   I never tied it together.
[00:53:21.120 --> 00:53:22.120]   Don't worry.
[00:53:22.120 --> 00:53:23.120]   I won't get any detail.
[00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:24.120]   No, I know.
[00:53:24.120 --> 00:53:25.120]   You don't have to.
[00:53:25.120 --> 00:53:26.120]   I already said it.
[00:53:26.120 --> 00:53:27.120]   Months.
[00:53:27.120 --> 00:53:28.120]   Yeah.
[00:53:28.120 --> 00:53:29.120]   I'm just Leo.
[00:53:29.120 --> 00:53:31.160]   I could have told you that.
[00:53:31.160 --> 00:53:32.160]   This weekend regularity.
[00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:34.000]   I'm trying this weekend regularity.
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:35.000]   It's a good show.
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:36.800]   It's a show I want to do.
[00:53:36.800 --> 00:53:39.440]   I'm definitely glad I'm not TDing this show.
[00:53:39.440 --> 00:53:44.600]   I'm going to be out of here in a couple minutes.
[00:53:44.600 --> 00:53:45.840]   I'm looking for the...
[00:53:45.840 --> 00:53:47.440]   So this thing has this little screen on it.
[00:53:47.440 --> 00:53:48.680]   Any other story to talk about?
[00:53:48.680 --> 00:53:49.680]   Oh, no.
[00:53:49.680 --> 00:53:50.680]   I'm looking for the selfie.
[00:53:50.680 --> 00:53:51.680]   That's duo, right?
[00:53:51.680 --> 00:53:57.320]   The guy's talking on duo and then it has the controls down here, which is neat.
[00:53:57.320 --> 00:53:59.480]   I'm trying to show the selfie.
[00:53:59.480 --> 00:54:00.480]   The selfie.
[00:54:00.480 --> 00:54:01.480]   Okay.
[00:54:01.480 --> 00:54:05.080]   So this little screen here is a screen.
[00:54:05.080 --> 00:54:08.840]   So if you use this as a camera, a selfie camera, it'll have a little tiny picture of you with
[00:54:08.840 --> 00:54:12.960]   your head cut off, before head cut off, which I think is kind of neat.
[00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:13.960]   That is neat.
[00:54:13.960 --> 00:54:14.960]   I think you're going to want this.
[00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:20.040]   And I like the idea of being able to put it in more places so you're not getting that
[00:54:20.040 --> 00:54:22.800]   up the nose view of people when you're trying to talk to them on duo.
[00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:28.120]   I think that they've made actually a pretty strong case for what the flipping, what the
[00:54:28.120 --> 00:54:29.120]   folding...
[00:54:29.120 --> 00:54:34.360]   What we really need is a little drone cam for our selfies so we can just have this action.
[00:54:34.360 --> 00:54:36.160]   They have those out there.
[00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:41.160]   I know they make drones, but I want my phone just to be like support.
[00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:43.120]   You want to simulate that.
[00:54:43.120 --> 00:54:45.960]   I wanted to have little quidditch wings.
[00:54:45.960 --> 00:54:48.320]   Golden snitch wings pop out.
[00:54:48.320 --> 00:54:52.880]   That's what they should make, a golden snitch phone.
[00:54:52.880 --> 00:54:55.960]   Oh, I would buy that.
[00:54:55.960 --> 00:54:56.960]   You pottery.
[00:54:56.960 --> 00:54:59.600]   How many years before somebody comes on stage?
[00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:01.080]   Oh, one more thing.
[00:55:01.080 --> 00:55:02.080]   It flies.
[00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:03.080]   It flies.
[00:55:03.080 --> 00:55:04.080]   It flies.
[00:55:04.080 --> 00:55:05.080]   Forget flying cars.
[00:55:05.080 --> 00:55:06.080]   Yeah, that's what I want.
[00:55:06.080 --> 00:55:14.080]   I want a flying phone.
[00:55:14.080 --> 00:55:16.160]   All right.
[00:55:16.160 --> 00:55:18.200]   What else?
[00:55:18.200 --> 00:55:19.200]   We did viral analysis.
[00:55:19.200 --> 00:55:23.520]   I was probably playing the Leo role of...
[00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:26.040]   I'll argue her.
[00:55:26.040 --> 00:55:31.480]   Oh, I think it's weak in regularity again.
[00:55:31.480 --> 00:55:32.480]   No.
[00:55:32.480 --> 00:55:35.920]   FTC investigating Google.
[00:55:35.920 --> 00:55:37.520]   They're not just looking at now.
[00:55:37.520 --> 00:55:40.360]   They're going back through Google's acquisitions.
[00:55:40.360 --> 00:55:43.040]   In fact, not just Google.
[00:55:43.040 --> 00:55:48.800]   Turns out there were a number of acquisitions made by Google Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft.
[00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:49.720]   And Apple.
[00:55:49.720 --> 00:55:50.720]   And Apple.
[00:55:50.720 --> 00:55:52.240]   That flew under the radar.
[00:55:52.240 --> 00:55:54.360]   They were so small they didn't have to get approval.
[00:55:54.360 --> 00:56:01.960]   Now the FTC has decided to go back to 2010 and get information that wasn't previously
[00:56:01.960 --> 00:56:05.160]   required under existing antitrust regulations.
[00:56:05.160 --> 00:56:08.280]   This is what I was saying before.
[00:56:08.280 --> 00:56:10.320]   One has to wonder about the load of.
[00:56:10.320 --> 00:56:11.320]   Sure feels like harassment.
[00:56:11.320 --> 00:56:16.960]   Of course, on the other hand, the president yesterday pointed out that MAGA stands for
[00:56:16.960 --> 00:56:20.160]   Microsoft Apple, Google, and Amazon.
[00:56:20.160 --> 00:56:21.680]   Amazon.
[00:56:21.680 --> 00:56:22.680]   So there.
[00:56:22.680 --> 00:56:23.680]   I'm sure they're delighted.
[00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:24.680]   Right.
[00:56:24.680 --> 00:56:27.280]   Somebody said get those hats made up.
[00:56:27.280 --> 00:56:28.280]   It's not actually Google.
[00:56:28.280 --> 00:56:30.680]   I think this is why Google changed its alphabet.
[00:56:30.680 --> 00:56:32.040]   Yeah, it's actually alphabet.
[00:56:32.040 --> 00:56:33.040]   So it's my...
[00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:37.880]   Well, then he'll just make it alphabet because we don't have to mention Amazon.
[00:56:37.880 --> 00:56:43.680]   Mr. Jarvis, you said this sounds like harassment.
[00:56:43.680 --> 00:56:44.680]   Yep.
[00:56:44.680 --> 00:56:45.680]   It does.
[00:56:45.680 --> 00:56:46.680]   Yep.
[00:56:46.680 --> 00:56:53.080]   Although there are, I don't know how you would undo this, but there are several acquisitions
[00:56:53.080 --> 00:56:59.280]   and they talk about the ones, especially where they bought the company and shut it down.
[00:56:59.280 --> 00:57:00.280]   I can think of a couple more.
[00:57:00.280 --> 00:57:01.800]   Yeah, but they investigated the time.
[00:57:01.800 --> 00:57:03.640]   It's a little 10 years later.
[00:57:03.640 --> 00:57:04.640]   10 years now.
[00:57:04.640 --> 00:57:05.640]   Oh, yeah.
[00:57:05.640 --> 00:57:06.640]   This doesn't.
[00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:07.640]   What do you want to do about it?
[00:57:07.640 --> 00:57:08.640]   Well, and that's the thing.
[00:57:08.640 --> 00:57:10.760]   He's like, we don't know what we're going to do about it.
[00:57:10.760 --> 00:57:12.560]   He gets on the, you know, on the conference call.
[00:57:12.560 --> 00:57:15.160]   He's like, well, unwind it.
[00:57:15.160 --> 00:57:16.160]   We could.
[00:57:16.160 --> 00:57:18.920]   But I mean, as a journalist, it's exciting.
[00:57:18.920 --> 00:57:25.760]   You're going to have access to public transcripts and files that otherwise we won't know.
[00:57:25.760 --> 00:57:28.680]   So there's going to be an interesting look at this sort of thing.
[00:57:28.680 --> 00:57:32.920]   Although while this is happening, it'll be interesting to see what happens to deal flow
[00:57:32.920 --> 00:57:33.920]   in the Valley.
[00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:34.920]   Yep.
[00:57:34.920 --> 00:57:42.120]   Tied to that is if Bernie Sanders actually becomes president, which long shot I know,
[00:57:42.120 --> 00:57:46.800]   but if you're a private equity or venture capital firm and either Sanders or Warren
[00:57:46.800 --> 00:57:49.160]   have both been pretty cool about changing laws.
[00:57:49.160 --> 00:57:51.320]   That's why it's a long shot, by the way.
[00:57:51.320 --> 00:57:56.360]   Yeah, it's because, you know, every billionaire in the country, every hedge fund in the country,
[00:57:56.360 --> 00:58:01.200]   all that money, that dark money is going to start pouring into anybody, but Bernie, anybody,
[00:58:01.200 --> 00:58:02.280]   but Liz, because.
[00:58:02.280 --> 00:58:08.200]   But in 2020, so if you're really worried about that happening as a VC, you're like,
[00:58:08.200 --> 00:58:13.720]   holy crap, I need to one, have my plan B, which is funding all these other things, but
[00:58:13.720 --> 00:58:20.160]   you also need to, or sorry, that's plan A. Plan B is prep in your stuff to sell so you
[00:58:20.160 --> 00:58:23.560]   can get your gains before your tax law changes.
[00:58:23.560 --> 00:58:24.560]   So.
[00:58:24.560 --> 00:58:25.560]   Right.
[00:58:25.560 --> 00:58:28.760]   Can we do my favorite story of the week?
[00:58:28.760 --> 00:58:32.520]   I'm going to guess it's the German man who planted his cornfield in a certain.
[00:58:32.520 --> 00:58:35.000]   No, no, but you can do that one now.
[00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:39.920]   Vystwomik, hi, hi, hi, will you marry me?
[00:58:39.920 --> 00:58:48.760]   He planted his corn to propose marriage in Hittenberg, Germany and Google Maps got it.
[00:58:48.760 --> 00:58:49.760]   No, it's not.
[00:58:49.760 --> 00:58:50.760]   No, I don't know.
[00:58:50.760 --> 00:58:57.440]   They don't say how he then got his perspective bride to go to this particular Google Maps
[00:58:57.440 --> 00:58:58.440]   page.
[00:58:58.440 --> 00:58:59.440]   No, I'm kidding.
[00:58:59.440 --> 00:59:00.440]   I kind of wondered too.
[00:59:00.440 --> 00:59:01.440]   No, look at the pixels.
[00:59:01.440 --> 00:59:02.440]   That's definitely real.
[00:59:02.440 --> 00:59:03.440]   Yeah, I'm teasing.
[00:59:03.440 --> 00:59:04.440]   Oh, you romantic you.
[00:59:04.440 --> 00:59:13.440]   How long from doing this to like are those images uploaded?
[00:59:13.440 --> 00:59:15.440]   Google doesn't like it's about six months.
[00:59:15.440 --> 00:59:16.440]   Okay.
[00:59:16.440 --> 00:59:19.880]   This is just my ever my I keep an eye on my house.
[00:59:19.880 --> 00:59:20.960]   It takes about six months.
[00:59:20.960 --> 00:59:22.880]   I think that's because you live in the boonies, though.
[00:59:22.880 --> 00:59:26.880]   I bet you know, this guy's landed on cornfield.
[00:59:26.880 --> 00:59:31.120]   That's a big city, man.
[00:59:31.120 --> 00:59:32.120]   Hittenberg.
[00:59:32.120 --> 00:59:37.120]   The thing is, if you know, if you know, you're going to propose in the next year, you do
[00:59:37.120 --> 00:59:38.720]   this, give you a little time out first.
[00:59:38.720 --> 00:59:39.720]   The corn's got to grow.
[00:59:39.720 --> 00:59:42.640]   And as soon as honey, are you ever going to marry me?
[00:59:42.640 --> 00:59:44.880]   Wait, I got to wait for the corn to grow.
[00:59:44.880 --> 00:59:46.840]   Honey, you ever go to marry me?
[00:59:46.840 --> 00:59:49.320]   I got to wait for the satellite to go over.
[00:59:49.320 --> 00:59:52.160]   Honey, you ever going to marry me?
[00:59:52.160 --> 00:59:55.640]   Well, just wait to those pictures show up.
[00:59:55.640 --> 00:59:56.640]   You got to break up.
[00:59:56.640 --> 00:59:58.240]   I have to go destroy the crop.
[00:59:58.240 --> 00:59:59.240]   Yeah, really.
[00:59:59.240 --> 01:00:00.240]   What's that?
[01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:04.160]   It's ego over any sort of someone else's feelings.
[01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:07.680]   I mean, really, really.
[01:00:07.680 --> 01:00:13.080]   Actually, he didn't plan for it to be on Google Maps.
[01:00:13.080 --> 01:00:19.120]   He was he got his girlfriend to fly a drone over the field last May in Hittenberg.
[01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:21.720]   And then she saw the picture.
[01:00:21.720 --> 01:00:28.240]   He told the AP he had an antenna that expected the image to appear on Google's Maps until
[01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:33.040]   an aunt in Canada pointed it out to him.
[01:00:33.040 --> 01:00:39.200]   According to the Associated Press, the German fella and his fiance planned to marry in June.
[01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:41.120]   Stefan Schwartz.
[01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:42.120]   Hittenberg.
[01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:43.880]   He's going to Hittenberg.
[01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:47.840]   He's going to make a find a house fowl out of her.
[01:00:47.840 --> 01:00:55.040]   Make the fowl line and make a fowl in Hittenberg, which is central Germany and apparently has
[01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:56.040]   cornfields.
[01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:58.960]   A friend of mine is married to a German man.
[01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:01.360]   She says that for his quite often.
[01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:02.360]   Fowl line.
[01:01:02.360 --> 01:01:03.360]   How's fowl?
[01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:04.360]   House fowl.
[01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:05.360]   House fowl.
[01:01:05.360 --> 01:01:06.360]   It's always fun to hear it.
[01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:09.120]   Why mom says that all the time too?
[01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:10.120]   Really.
[01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:11.120]   And what context?
[01:01:11.120 --> 01:01:14.120]   Shut up of being a house fowl.
[01:01:14.120 --> 01:01:15.520]   She jokes about it.
[01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:16.520]   What does that just mean?
[01:01:16.520 --> 01:01:17.520]   Housewife.
[01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:21.200]   I mean, my mom wasn't a housewife, but she used it.
[01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:24.880]   Instead of sitting, stay at home mom or something like that, you're a housewife.
[01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:25.880]   Right.
[01:01:25.880 --> 01:01:26.880]   Oh, so it's a little put down.
[01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:28.560]   No, it wasn't a put down.
[01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:29.560]   It just changed.
[01:01:29.560 --> 01:01:30.560]   No, no, no.
[01:01:30.560 --> 01:01:31.560]   It's all the time.
[01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:33.840]   Is it a put down to call it South Carolina?
[01:01:33.840 --> 01:01:34.840]   No.
[01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:35.840]   Okay.
[01:01:35.840 --> 01:01:36.840]   I say it all the time.
[01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:37.840]   Okay.
[01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:38.840]   South Carolina.
[01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:39.840]   You did.
[01:01:39.840 --> 01:01:40.840]   And I thought maybe, but then I thought I better ask Gant before I say it.
[01:01:40.840 --> 01:01:41.840]   South Carolina.
[01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:42.840]   You know, South Carolina will say South Carolina.
[01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:43.840]   South Carolina.
[01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:44.840]   I like it in there.
[01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:45.840]   What is that?
[01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:46.840]   South Carolina.
[01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:48.600]   South Kake Laki.
[01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:53.400]   The reason it came up is Saturday at Live on Saturday, they had a parody of the debates
[01:01:53.400 --> 01:01:56.080]   and they had Joe Biden saying, well, I'm going out of South Kake Laki.
[01:01:56.080 --> 01:01:57.080]   Yes, sir.
[01:01:57.080 --> 01:02:00.600]   And I thought, okay, that's questionable.
[01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:01.600]   Yeah.
[01:02:01.600 --> 01:02:04.800]   So, but I do remember ants saying it.
[01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:05.800]   Pretty common.
[01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:06.800]   Yeah.
[01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:08.400]   My favorite story.
[01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:09.400]   Yeah.
[01:02:09.400 --> 01:02:11.440]   Is the first one under Amazon.
[01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:12.440]   Oh, yeah.
[01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:13.440]   You said you had a story.
[01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:14.440]   I laughed hard.
[01:02:14.440 --> 01:02:15.440]   He laughed hard.
[01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:20.160]   Oh, I had to say I did too.
[01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:21.920]   I put this in.
[01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:24.800]   This is a tweet thread from Dade Messlin.
[01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:27.160]   Shall we just go through it?
[01:02:27.160 --> 01:02:28.160]   Let's just go through it.
[01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:29.160]   I think it's so great.
[01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:32.240]   Three weeks ago, I ordered a box of boxes.
[01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:38.080]   He wanted some packing boxes from package wholesalers via Amazon Canada, specifically
[01:02:38.080 --> 01:02:43.320]   out of the package of 25 boxes, six by nine by six.
[01:02:43.320 --> 01:02:46.280]   When the delivery arrived in my door, it wasn't a box of boxes.
[01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:51.520]   It was a box of chocolate sea salt granola packets.
[01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:53.840]   I was frustrated, but mistakes happened.
[01:02:53.840 --> 01:02:57.320]   So I went to Amazon.ca and saw that I could send the package back for free.
[01:02:57.320 --> 01:03:01.960]   I clicked on wrong item shipped, asked them to reshift the correct item a few days later.
[01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:05.200]   Another box of granola arrived.
[01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:08.600]   I shipped it back, canceled the order, asked for a refund.
[01:03:08.600 --> 01:03:12.120]   Then starting a fresh reordered the boxes.
[01:03:12.120 --> 01:03:14.920]   I figured, what's the chance that it happened again?
[01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:19.840]   Two days later, I got a box of Harry Potter coasters.
[01:03:19.840 --> 01:03:21.880]   The Marauders map coaster said four piece.
[01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:22.880]   I kid you not.
[01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:27.800]   He says I kid you not a package of Harry Potter coasters.
[01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:31.440]   I returned the item for reasons I can't fathom instead of asking for a refund.
[01:03:31.440 --> 01:03:34.760]   Well, this guy is like lun for punishment.
[01:03:34.760 --> 01:03:38.120]   I again asked them to send me the correct order yesterday.
[01:03:38.120 --> 01:03:40.040]   I got another box of granola.
[01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:42.400]   Today I figured out the problem.
[01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:46.880]   The granola company and the coaster company buy their boxes from the same people I'm trying
[01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:48.960]   to buy my boxes from.
[01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:54.520]   And the barcodes, a scanners at Amazon are picking up the old sticker.
[01:03:54.520 --> 01:03:58.680]   The old sticker from the box company on the new sticker.
[01:03:58.680 --> 01:03:59.680]   It's underneath the new sticker.
[01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:02.920]   So each time I was getting the wrong order, I was getting one correct box.
[01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:09.160]   So now I think I should throw 25 packages of 25 boxes, shipped the sea salt granola back
[01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:15.760]   to Amazon plastic bags and just keep the boxes free answered after this thread was posted.
[01:04:15.760 --> 01:04:19.480]   You got a nice message from Amazon help asking me to contact the support team following a
[01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:23.080]   40 minute online chat.
[01:04:23.080 --> 01:04:26.880]   No, I was told you've been delivered the wrong items because there was some error.
[01:04:26.880 --> 01:04:28.240]   But now you'll get the proper items.
[01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:30.280]   I said the air has been fixed.
[01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:31.680]   It wasn't fixed the first three times.
[01:04:31.680 --> 01:04:34.880]   I'm skeptical Amazon said you will get the correct item.
[01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:36.560]   I don't want any more hassles for you.
[01:04:36.560 --> 01:04:41.560]   Do not worry.
[01:04:41.560 --> 01:04:46.560]   I reordered the package wholesaler boxes.
[01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:49.560]   I'll give you a nickel if you guess what happened next.
[01:04:49.560 --> 01:04:50.560]   Granola.
[01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:51.560]   Granola.
[01:04:51.560 --> 01:04:52.560]   I love this so much.
[01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:57.480]   I have now received a total of 12 bags of granola for Harry Potter coasters.
[01:04:57.480 --> 01:05:00.080]   I reached out to the package wholesalers.
[01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:02.080]   They brushed me off.
[01:05:02.080 --> 01:05:06.520]   I'm just going to go to a damn store, you know, a physical place with things in it.
[01:05:06.520 --> 01:05:09.520]   I think I would have done that the first time.
[01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:10.520]   Yeah, Canada.
[01:05:10.520 --> 01:05:13.520]   This is why Canada is so wonderful.
[01:05:13.520 --> 01:05:16.520]   Someone with patience is nice.
[01:05:16.520 --> 01:05:18.520]   Who hopes for the best.
[01:05:18.520 --> 01:05:19.520]   I love this.
[01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:21.520]   I just love this.
[01:05:21.520 --> 01:05:31.520]   By the way, this story, a number of people, of course, it's Twitter, weighed in.
[01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:36.520]   With lots of ideas and thoughts and so forth.
[01:05:36.520 --> 01:05:37.520]   That's a great story.
[01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:39.520]   I'm glad you like that.
[01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:40.520]   I saw that.
[01:05:40.520 --> 01:05:42.520]   We should talk about this on Twig.
[01:05:42.520 --> 01:05:46.520]   Mr. Mezlin, I like granola if you care to send me a chocolate granola.
[01:05:46.520 --> 01:05:48.520]   You clearly have plenty of it.
[01:05:48.520 --> 01:05:49.520]   I think he sent it back.
[01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:50.520]   Didn't he say he sent it back?
[01:05:50.520 --> 01:05:52.520]   I think he got to keep sending it back.
[01:05:52.520 --> 01:05:53.520]   No, he kept sending it back.
[01:05:53.520 --> 01:05:54.520]   He kept sending it back.
[01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:56.520]   What he should have done is...
[01:05:56.520 --> 01:06:00.520]   He should have ordered two and then you'd have an extra box.
[01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:02.520]   He could send the box.
[01:06:02.520 --> 01:06:06.520]   He would only have to order it twice.
[01:06:06.520 --> 01:06:07.520]   50 times.
[01:06:07.520 --> 01:06:10.520]   He'll have all the boxes.
[01:06:10.520 --> 01:06:11.520]   Oh, bless his heart.
[01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:15.520]   We didn't even talk about Facebook's Twitter account getting hacked.
[01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:16.520]   Oh, man.
[01:06:16.520 --> 01:06:21.520]   Not much to say it didn't last that long, but...
[01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:26.520]   People are just proving a point out there that, "Hey, we don't care how big you are.
[01:06:26.520 --> 01:06:28.520]   We'll come at the unit."
[01:06:28.520 --> 01:06:30.520]   Do we know Stacey?
[01:06:30.520 --> 01:06:33.520]   Did Stacey already tell us that Nest was going to require two factor?
[01:06:33.520 --> 01:06:34.520]   Was that old news or new news?
[01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:35.520]   No, that's new news.
[01:06:35.520 --> 01:06:37.520]   I have not told you that.
[01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:39.520]   Google to force.
[01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:45.520]   I think this is after the embarrassment that Ring went through.
[01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:48.520]   Nest went through the same thing a couple months earlier.
[01:06:48.520 --> 01:06:50.520]   I have my own theory on this.
[01:06:50.520 --> 01:06:51.520]   You want to hear Stacey's crazy theory?
[01:06:51.520 --> 01:06:52.520]   That's why I'm asking.
[01:06:52.520 --> 01:06:53.520]   Yeah.
[01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:55.520]   Okay, so here's my crazy theory.
[01:06:55.520 --> 01:07:00.520]   One, they saw everything that was Ring was going through and all the people were like...
[01:07:00.520 --> 01:07:02.520]   And this had happened to Nest as well.
[01:07:02.520 --> 01:07:07.520]   So Nest had also had their people's cameras hacked because their passwords were stolen.
[01:07:07.520 --> 01:07:11.520]   And Nest said, "Hey, we've been making two factor available."
[01:07:11.520 --> 01:07:13.520]   Nest has been very proactive and made it available.
[01:07:13.520 --> 01:07:17.520]   But what I think is happening is there's a law in California.
[01:07:17.520 --> 01:07:21.520]   It's the Device Internet Device Security Act.
[01:07:21.520 --> 01:07:25.520]   And that went into effect in January.
[01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:29.520]   And one of the provisions of that law is you have to secure your devices based...
[01:07:29.520 --> 01:07:33.520]   It has to have reasonable security based on the type of data it's gathered.
[01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:34.520]   So I think...
[01:07:34.520 --> 01:07:35.520]   And I made this case.
[01:07:35.520 --> 01:07:36.520]   So that's why I think this.
[01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:37.520]   Because, you know, me.
[01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:38.520]   Makes sense.
[01:07:38.520 --> 01:07:39.520]   Makes sense.
[01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:42.520]   The AG has not talked about this yet.
[01:07:42.520 --> 01:07:45.520]   But I think companies are looking at this and saying, "Hey, I do...
[01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:49.520]   I mean, a camera that has a full picture into your home."
[01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:54.520]   Or control over your thermostat is that sort of level of data like, "I'm home or not."
[01:07:54.520 --> 01:07:56.520]   That feels pretty important.
[01:07:56.520 --> 01:07:58.520]   So maybe we should make it extra secure.
[01:07:58.520 --> 01:07:59.520]   Right.
[01:07:59.520 --> 01:08:00.520]   Day one.
[01:08:00.520 --> 01:08:02.520]   This isn't in California law or anything, right?
[01:08:02.520 --> 01:08:05.520]   It's not requiring that, but they are responsible for securing it.
[01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:07.520]   I mean, basically that's what the law wants, though.
[01:08:07.520 --> 01:08:08.520]   Yeah.
[01:08:08.520 --> 01:08:09.520]   No, that's...
[01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:11.520]   It doesn't specify two factor.
[01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:13.520]   It doesn't say how you should do it.
[01:08:13.520 --> 01:08:15.520]   And here's what the really cool part is.
[01:08:15.520 --> 01:08:20.520]   If Ness does this and hopefully if the AG does come out and say, "Yeah."
[01:08:20.520 --> 01:08:21.520]   That's what we're talking about.
[01:08:21.520 --> 01:08:22.520]   That's what we're talking about.
[01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:23.520]   Yeah.
[01:08:23.520 --> 01:08:24.520]   That's what we're talking about.
[01:08:24.520 --> 01:08:25.520]   Go Nest.
[01:08:25.520 --> 01:08:29.520]   Then I think we'll get to a really interesting place where we start seeing things like Google's
[01:08:29.520 --> 01:08:34.520]   in a good spot to do like Face ID or they don't call it Face ID, whatever they do for a full
[01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:35.520]   multi-factor.
[01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:38.520]   And then we get more convenient multi-factor authentication, which would be...
[01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:39.520]   Oh, Lou.
[01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:40.520]   That was my next question.
[01:08:40.520 --> 01:08:41.520]   I actually love this.
[01:08:41.520 --> 01:08:42.520]   How hard is this going to be to do?
[01:08:42.520 --> 01:08:46.520]   A lot of apps on my iPhone will...
[01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:49.520]   Because Apple makes the Face ID kit or whatever.
[01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:55.520]   The iPhone will be a tricky one because you can't do Face ID unless you are Apple.
[01:08:55.520 --> 01:08:56.520]   No, no, that's not true.
[01:08:56.520 --> 01:08:57.520]   Okay.
[01:08:57.520 --> 01:08:58.520]   That is not true.
[01:08:58.520 --> 01:08:59.520]   Okay.
[01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:00.520]   Yeah.
[01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:01.520]   Apple has...
[01:09:01.520 --> 01:09:02.520]   Face book has all your faces.
[01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:03.520]   Apple hat...
[01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:04.520]   No, no, wait a minute.
[01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:05.520]   Yeah, right.
[01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:06.520]   Apple has a kit for it.
[01:09:06.520 --> 01:09:09.520]   I don't know what they call it, ID kit or something that any developer can use.
[01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:16.520]   So quite a few of my apps, including my email app, not Apple's, but Canary Mail, my banking
[01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:19.520]   app will use Face ID as its second factor.
[01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:22.520]   And that is a hugely convenient thing.
[01:09:22.520 --> 01:09:28.520]   And assuming that unlike Face book, Apple keeps the Face ID information on the phone,
[01:09:28.520 --> 01:09:32.520]   I think that's a harmless and excellent way to provide second factor.
[01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:33.520]   I like that idea.
[01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:40.520]   And this is honestly a good reason for Facebook stealing your face.
[01:09:40.520 --> 01:09:43.520]   It's like this is...
[01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:47.520]   They can use it for evil things, selling it to advertisers, but they could use it for
[01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:50.520]   good things too, to secure your account better.
[01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:52.520]   Nobody wants Face book to do the Face ID stuff.
[01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:56.520]   I don't want Face book securing any of it.
[01:09:56.520 --> 01:09:59.520]   They already know when I open apps, which is really just...
[01:09:59.520 --> 01:10:02.520]   It keeps people from hacking my Face book.
[01:10:02.520 --> 01:10:03.520]   No, no, no, no.
[01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:07.520]   No, I'd rather do it with Google, I'd do it with Apple, no Face book.
[01:10:07.520 --> 01:10:10.520]   Do it on device and both Google and Apple treat that as on device.
[01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:11.520]   Right.
[01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:13.520]   They've got my face already.
[01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:15.520]   No, Carson.
[01:10:15.520 --> 01:10:18.520]   Let's not give them anything else, Carson.
[01:10:18.520 --> 01:10:19.520]   Yeah, because they're...
[01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:21.520]   No, you do every time you use it.
[01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:26.520]   Every time you use it, you're telling them, you're telling them, "I'm Carson, I'm on this
[01:10:26.520 --> 01:10:28.520]   device, I'm opening this app."
[01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:30.520]   I am in this place.
[01:10:30.520 --> 01:10:32.520]   I'm giving them that information.
[01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:34.520]   And all of a sudden everybody knows you gave.
[01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:36.520]   I'm giving them that information every time I open their app.
[01:10:36.520 --> 01:10:40.520]   Now, all I would give them is another picture of my face.
[01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:44.520]   Hey, Carson, just accuse them of moral panic and they'll only set them off.
[01:10:44.520 --> 01:10:45.520]   Here's the thing, Carson.
[01:10:45.520 --> 01:10:46.520]   You're right.
[01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:49.520]   If Face book uses it to unlock the Face book app, that's fine.
[01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:54.520]   But if you use that to unlock your banking app, now Face book is getting the signal that
[01:10:54.520 --> 01:10:57.520]   you open the banking app where you opened it.
[01:10:57.520 --> 01:10:59.520]   Who knows what else?
[01:10:59.520 --> 01:11:00.520]   No, I just...
[01:11:00.520 --> 01:11:02.520]   Facebook Face ID on your banking app.
[01:11:02.520 --> 01:11:06.520]   I don't want to use Apple's Face ID to log into Facebook.
[01:11:06.520 --> 01:11:08.520]   I want to use Facebook.
[01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:09.520]   Yes, you do.
[01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:10.520]   Trust me.
[01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:13.520]   I would rather Facebook say, "Is this you?
[01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:18.520]   Let us take a picture of you right now to log you in."
[01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:19.520]   What?
[01:11:19.520 --> 01:11:20.520]   No.
[01:11:20.520 --> 01:11:22.520]   Carson, you are weird.
[01:11:22.520 --> 01:11:23.520]   Is this Devil's Advocate?
[01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:24.520]   Well, we do that.
[01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:25.520]   Devil's Advocate.
[01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:26.520]   I'm telling you.
[01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:31.520]   You're interested in staying in your basement and don't buy any more.
[01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:32.520]   I'm trying to secure there.
[01:11:32.520 --> 01:11:34.520]   I'm trying to think more like a problem.
[01:11:34.520 --> 01:11:36.520]   He's in a secure location.
[01:11:36.520 --> 01:11:37.520]   That's right.
[01:11:37.520 --> 01:11:38.520]   You don't even know where he is.
[01:11:38.520 --> 01:11:39.520]   No.
[01:11:39.520 --> 01:11:44.520]   Face book suspends accounts in Russia and other countries for misinformation.
[01:11:44.520 --> 01:11:49.520]   Oh, that'll help.
[01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:52.520]   Myanmar, Russia, and Iran, those accounts are now suspended.
[01:11:52.520 --> 01:11:57.520]   I guess they'll just have to remake them in the US.
[01:11:57.520 --> 01:12:01.520]   They're doing everything they can.
[01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:03.520]   We're screaming at them to do something.
[01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:04.520]   They do something.
[01:12:04.520 --> 01:12:07.520]   Let me say, "Oh, that's not going to help."
[01:12:07.520 --> 01:12:08.520]   Well, it isn't.
[01:12:08.520 --> 01:12:09.520]   I've got to be honest.
[01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:10.520]   It's not.
[01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:12.520]   I guess we're supposed to appreciate the effort.
[01:12:12.520 --> 01:12:19.120]   Well, there is value in making the transaction costs higher by shutting things down in a
[01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:21.520]   constant and repeatable way.
[01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:22.520]   Yeah.
[01:12:22.520 --> 01:12:25.520]   Is it the most effective thing?
[01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:26.520]   Probably not.
[01:12:26.520 --> 01:12:27.520]   It's better than nothing.
[01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:32.520]   It's better than what you can say.
[01:12:32.520 --> 01:12:37.520]   Now, I would show this new Facebook design, but I'm not on Facebook.
[01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:38.520]   Jeff, you don't like it.
[01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:39.520]   I couldn't get it.
[01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:40.520]   I couldn't get it.
[01:12:40.520 --> 01:12:42.520]   Well, not everybody's getting it.
[01:12:42.520 --> 01:12:44.520]   Some users will get the new redesign.
[01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:46.520]   It will roll out later this year.
[01:12:46.520 --> 01:12:48.520]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:12:48.520 --> 01:12:53.160]   You can enable, it says, "The new look by logging into Facebook and selecting C Facebook beta
[01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:54.800]   at the top of your news feed."
[01:12:54.800 --> 01:12:55.800]   I don't see it.
[01:12:55.800 --> 01:12:57.360]   Yeah, so not everyone will have that.
[01:12:57.360 --> 01:12:59.520]   That's what Life Hacker says.
[01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:00.520]   Yeah.
[01:13:00.520 --> 01:13:04.520]   I mean, hard for me to carry deeply about this.
[01:13:04.520 --> 01:13:07.000]   We used to actually do stories with somebody to redesign.
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:08.000]   No, we just don't care.
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:09.000]   Who cares?
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:10.000]   Yeah.
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:14.640]   So jaded, like, like, and we're jaded.
[01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:15.640]   Did you guys hear it?
[01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:16.640]   It was an excellent experience.
[01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:20.920]   I had stopped listening to Daily for a while, but they did an excellent one this week interviewing
[01:13:20.920 --> 01:13:23.000]   KazuME and Hill about her experience.
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:26.400]   Maybe it was last week about her experiences with Clearview AI.
[01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:28.800]   Did you guys listen to that highly recommended?
[01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:30.920]   I have to listen to it at double speed.
[01:13:30.920 --> 01:13:33.880]   I know, because my cup of error doesn't slow.
[01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:41.240]   But the good news is it's not Michael Pabara doing the interview.
[01:13:41.240 --> 01:13:44.880]   And she's somebody else from the New York Times.
[01:13:44.880 --> 01:13:45.880]   Okay.
[01:13:45.880 --> 01:13:51.000]   And any event, KazuME who was also a New York Times reporter had some very interesting experiences
[01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:52.000]   with Clearview.
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:57.200]   Clearview is the mysterious company that's been scraping YouTube, Facebook, in fact, the
[01:13:57.200 --> 01:14:03.680]   whole public internet for face images of you, which they then can sell to a law enforcement,
[01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:05.760]   their face recognition technology, they claim.
[01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:09.440]   And it seems to be the case is like 99.6% accurate.
[01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:15.200]   Weirdly, though, KazuME got a friend who was in the police department to enter in a picture
[01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:18.800]   of her and nothing came up.
[01:14:18.800 --> 01:14:19.800]   Hmm.
[01:14:19.800 --> 01:14:20.800]   Zero.
[01:14:20.800 --> 01:14:22.120]   And then even more for her.
[01:14:22.120 --> 01:14:28.440]   And then even more weirdly, he got suspended from his Clearview account saying you've been
[01:14:28.440 --> 01:14:30.800]   searching for a New York Times reporter.
[01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:36.760]   Oh, and then she confronts this.
[01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:41.320]   She finally gets an interview with somebody claiming to be the founder and CEO of Clearview,
[01:14:41.320 --> 01:14:42.880]   which I think is still undoubtedly.
[01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:44.680]   Who knows who really is?
[01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:48.320]   But he says, oh, yeah, that was a bug.
[01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:49.320]   She says a bug.
[01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:52.400]   Is this going to turn out like Cambridge Analytica that everybody was scared of and they actually
[01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:53.400]   couldn't do anything?
[01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:54.320]   No, no, they're very good.
[01:14:54.320 --> 01:14:55.320]   This is the problem.
[01:14:55.320 --> 01:15:00.480]   They're very, very good because they've been collecting billions of images from the public
[01:15:00.480 --> 01:15:01.480]   internet.
[01:15:01.480 --> 01:15:05.480]   By the way, which we know is now legal thanks to high queues.
[01:15:05.480 --> 01:15:06.480]   Thanks to Lincoln.
[01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:08.320]   Successful suit against LinkedIn.
[01:15:08.320 --> 01:15:13.000]   The appeals court said you can scrape anything that is well, but wait a minute.
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:17.360]   That seems reasonable if it's publicly available and a company figures out a way to suck it
[01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:18.360]   up.
[01:15:18.360 --> 01:15:19.360]   I don't know.
[01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:20.960]   Jason Howell and I talked about this.
[01:15:20.960 --> 01:15:22.320]   I think pictures are a different case though.
[01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:23.640]   You can like--
[01:15:23.640 --> 01:15:24.640]   Are they?
[01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:34.200]   Because a picture I take and that I give to Facebook is owned by me and Facebook.
[01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:35.760]   It's not owned by the public.
[01:15:35.760 --> 01:15:37.240]   But it's available in the public.
[01:15:37.240 --> 01:15:39.000]   It's not about availability.
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:40.000]   It's about ownership.
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:41.560]   But you own your Facebook.
[01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:46.520]   When you go out on the street, longstanding law says you have no right to privacy.
[01:15:46.520 --> 01:15:49.920]   If they pay Facebook and me for that picture.
[01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:51.160]   They don't pay Facebook.
[01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:52.160]   Then they can use it.
[01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:53.160]   They don't pay Facebook.
[01:15:53.160 --> 01:15:55.160]   If they don't pay Facebook, then it's illegal for them to use it.
[01:15:55.160 --> 01:15:56.160]   I disagree.
[01:15:56.160 --> 01:15:57.160]   You're wrong.
[01:15:57.160 --> 01:16:03.400]   No, under that doctrine, Karsten, then your VCR is illegal.
[01:16:03.400 --> 01:16:06.960]   Because that was the argument that putting it up from here to there on a database was
[01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:07.960]   the same as copying.
[01:16:07.960 --> 01:16:13.160]   I'm not making money off of my DVR.
[01:16:13.160 --> 01:16:14.160]   If I'm DVRing--
[01:16:14.160 --> 01:16:15.160]   You're robbing them of money.
[01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:24.280]   If I'm DVRing something and charging someone to look at my DVR, that's illegal.
[01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:26.160]   They're charging people to look at my picture.
[01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:27.160]   So that's illegal.
[01:16:27.160 --> 01:16:29.280]   You can't make money off of other people's--
[01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:32.120]   We put methamphetamine in Karsten's car.
[01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:33.120]   Does it eat?
[01:16:33.120 --> 01:16:35.120]   Karsten's actually right.
[01:16:35.120 --> 01:16:37.120]   What have we done here?
[01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:38.120]   This is how the law works.
[01:16:38.120 --> 01:16:39.120]   What have we lost?
[01:16:39.120 --> 01:16:41.160]   This is legal doctrine.
[01:16:41.160 --> 01:16:42.280]   This has been established.
[01:16:42.280 --> 01:16:47.960]   Now, what we could see is-- and what we probably will see is lawyers coming up with
[01:16:47.960 --> 01:16:51.680]   new legal doctrine around these sort of interactions.
[01:16:51.680 --> 01:16:54.000]   But there is established case law about this.
[01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:58.880]   So even though we may not agree with it, we don't have to.
[01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:01.960]   Clearview on their website says, "Search is the open web.
[01:17:01.960 --> 01:17:06.960]   Clearview does not and cannot search any private or protected inflow, including your
[01:17:06.960 --> 01:17:09.320]   private social media accounts.
[01:17:09.320 --> 01:17:12.520]   It's search not surveillance."
[01:17:12.520 --> 01:17:16.320]   Clearview is an after the fact research tool.
[01:17:16.320 --> 01:17:17.320]   We'll give that person a bonus.
[01:17:17.320 --> 01:17:18.800]   Clearview is not a surveillance system.
[01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:19.800]   It does not build like one.
[01:17:19.800 --> 01:17:24.320]   For example, analysts upload images from crime scenes and compare them to publicly available
[01:17:24.320 --> 01:17:25.320]   images.
[01:17:25.320 --> 01:17:30.280]   The most interesting-- one of another interesting thing in this daily piece with Kashmir Hill
[01:17:30.280 --> 01:17:36.920]   is how useful-- and this is the challenge-- Clearview has been to police departments.
[01:17:36.920 --> 01:17:42.200]   She gave, as an example, a child trafficker.
[01:17:42.200 --> 01:17:47.480]   They couldn't find this guy, couldn't find this guy, had a picture of him, submitted
[01:17:47.480 --> 01:17:51.560]   the Clearview database, and Clearview was able-- the picture they had of him, I think,
[01:17:51.560 --> 01:17:55.320]   is in the background, like a dim.
[01:17:55.320 --> 01:17:56.840]   His face is turned.
[01:17:56.840 --> 01:18:00.480]   It's not a good picture, but Clearview was able to track him down and they were able
[01:18:00.480 --> 01:18:01.640]   to arrest the guy.
[01:18:01.640 --> 01:18:04.960]   So this is what complicates it.
[01:18:04.960 --> 01:18:06.880]   It's very valuable.
[01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:08.680]   It's a great tool for law enforcement.
[01:18:08.680 --> 01:18:11.640]   Clearview says we only give this to law enforcement.
[01:18:11.640 --> 01:18:14.720]   We don't give it to the public.
[01:18:14.720 --> 01:18:17.720]   We only do it with a legal investigation.
[01:18:17.720 --> 01:18:19.240]   All right.
[01:18:19.240 --> 01:18:22.640]   So, Carson, your images on Facebook are strictly private.
[01:18:22.640 --> 01:18:25.080]   Make a private if you don't want to be scraped.
[01:18:25.080 --> 01:18:26.080]   Yeah.
[01:18:26.080 --> 01:18:28.280]   If they pay me for it, then they can--
[01:18:28.280 --> 01:18:30.080]   Well, there is a system to do that.
[01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:31.080]   So make a--
[01:18:31.080 --> 01:18:32.080]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[01:18:32.080 --> 01:18:33.080]   That's not what I'm asking.
[01:18:33.080 --> 01:18:35.080]   That's not what I'm asking.
[01:18:35.080 --> 01:18:39.160]   That's like saying that under that doctrine, under the Carson Doctrine, then Google can't
[01:18:39.160 --> 01:18:41.480]   scrape-- I found out you're German.
[01:18:41.480 --> 01:18:43.920]   Carson is a German name, after all.
[01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:48.000]   That's like the German publisher saying, Google, if you scrape by sight to link to me,
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:49.360]   you must pay me for that.
[01:18:49.360 --> 01:18:50.360]   Yes.
[01:18:50.360 --> 01:18:51.360]   And they passed a law--
[01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:52.360]   Same doctrine.
[01:18:52.360 --> 01:18:53.360]   And exactly.
[01:18:53.360 --> 01:18:54.360]   And they passed a law to do that.
[01:18:54.360 --> 01:18:55.360]   And then--
[01:18:55.360 --> 01:18:58.760]   And then the Germans realized, oh, wait, this law sucks.
[01:18:58.760 --> 01:19:01.520]   So no, you can-- that's OK.
[01:19:01.520 --> 01:19:04.560]   You can use my stuff for free.
[01:19:04.560 --> 01:19:05.560]   I'm looking at--
[01:19:05.560 --> 01:19:08.160]   It would break every search engine in the world, because that's how Google collects
[01:19:08.160 --> 01:19:09.880]   its search index.
[01:19:09.880 --> 01:19:12.960]   It's not a doctrine we want.
[01:19:12.960 --> 01:19:18.400]   No, Google has pushed back on that argument saying, we actually only scrape things that
[01:19:18.400 --> 01:19:20.800]   say we can scrape them.
[01:19:20.800 --> 01:19:21.800]   They--
[01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:22.800]   They have--
[01:19:22.800 --> 01:19:23.800]   Actually, you can--
[01:19:23.800 --> 01:19:24.800]   Clear view--
[01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:25.800]   Clear view said that to Google.
[01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:26.800]   And Google said, no.
[01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:27.800]   If you said--
[01:19:27.800 --> 01:19:31.480]   You can with robots.txt say, don't put this in my index, but you have to do that.
[01:19:31.480 --> 01:19:35.720]   I would submit that's no different than you saying, these are private photos on Facebook.
[01:19:35.720 --> 01:19:37.080]   It's the same thing.
[01:19:37.080 --> 01:19:40.400]   And Clear view says, if you give us that indication, we don't scrape it.
[01:19:40.400 --> 01:19:41.400]   Yes, that's what it--
[01:19:41.400 --> 01:19:42.400]   We can't scrape it.
[01:19:42.400 --> 01:19:43.400]   That's what should happen.
[01:19:43.400 --> 01:19:44.400]   But then--
[01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:48.000]   But Clear view now has been told, we don't want you to do this.
[01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.840]   So because Facebook saying it is a blanket thing, right?
[01:19:50.840 --> 01:19:51.840]   Yes.
[01:19:51.840 --> 01:19:52.840]   Right.
[01:19:52.840 --> 01:19:54.440]   Well, what about high-Q scraping, LinkedIn data?
[01:19:54.440 --> 01:19:57.720]   You think that was a bad thing too.
[01:19:57.720 --> 01:19:59.120]   Which-- what data did they scrape?
[01:19:59.120 --> 01:20:00.120]   I don't remember what they were.
[01:20:00.120 --> 01:20:02.120]   I think they were scraping--
[01:20:02.120 --> 01:20:05.600]   So you're going to say it depends on what they get?
[01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:06.600]   It depends on--
[01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:07.600]   Oh, that's a tough one.
[01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:08.600]   Oh.
[01:20:08.600 --> 01:20:09.600]   Yeah.
[01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:10.600]   [GRUNTING]
[01:20:10.600 --> 01:20:16.680]   Jason Howell and I talked about this last week on Tech News Weekly.
[01:20:16.680 --> 01:20:22.360]   I particularly don't pay attention to this type of surveillance talk or what have you.
[01:20:22.360 --> 01:20:28.760]   But back in Carolina, actually just a few miles from where I live, there was a riot
[01:20:28.760 --> 01:20:30.400]   in a convenience store.
[01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:34.280]   Some-- a bunch of people went in there and just rammed shit.
[01:20:34.280 --> 01:20:37.680]   Just tore the place up and the attendee was injured.
[01:20:37.680 --> 01:20:40.320]   They threw something at her and hurt the attendee.
[01:20:40.320 --> 01:20:42.960]   But no one could be identified.
[01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:49.000]   The police were a block away attending to pedestrians that had just gotten hit by a drunk
[01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:50.000]   driver.
[01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:51.000]   Yikes.
[01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:52.000]   So it was just--
[01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:53.000]   A mess.
[01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:54.760]   Chaotic mess, but no one could be identified.
[01:20:54.760 --> 01:20:58.720]   And I saw this Clear view article and I was thinking, man, this is a mess.
[01:20:58.720 --> 01:21:02.640]   This would have been helpful to find the idiots that went into that store and did what they
[01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:03.640]   did.
[01:21:03.640 --> 01:21:07.400]   But then there's other people saying, no, they shouldn't have this access to this public
[01:21:07.400 --> 01:21:11.600]   data here and scraping and being able to identify and help out lawn for some.
[01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:12.600]   But it's helpful.
[01:21:12.600 --> 01:21:14.040]   But it was truly helpful.
[01:21:14.040 --> 01:21:15.640]   And that was Cashmere's point.
[01:21:15.640 --> 01:21:16.640]   It's-- you know, this is complicated.
[01:21:16.640 --> 01:21:18.800]   All right, we're going to have a new segment on the show.
[01:21:18.800 --> 01:21:19.800]   Oh.
[01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:20.800]   What?
[01:21:20.800 --> 01:21:21.800]   I was going to say, we talked about this last week.
[01:21:21.800 --> 01:21:22.800]   Get a warrant.
[01:21:22.800 --> 01:21:23.800]   Get a warrant.
[01:21:23.800 --> 01:21:24.800]   Get a warrant.
[01:21:24.800 --> 01:21:26.800]   We're going to have a new segment on the show.
[01:21:26.800 --> 01:21:30.320]   Moral panic or privacy violation.
[01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:32.360]   You ready?
[01:21:32.360 --> 01:21:34.920]   It's time to play our game.
[01:21:34.920 --> 01:21:35.920]   Ready.
[01:21:35.920 --> 01:21:37.120]   You're a big whack-um tablet guy.
[01:21:37.120 --> 01:21:39.040]   You use a whack-um tablet.
[01:21:39.040 --> 01:21:45.880]   Robert Heaton, who is a software engineer, was curious about why the whack-um tablet
[01:21:45.880 --> 01:21:51.200]   asked permission to send stuff back to the home office.
[01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:56.600]   In version three, one of its privacy policy, whack-um said, would you mind if--
[01:21:56.600 --> 01:22:03.920]   if we send a few-- I'm reading Robert's blog post-- bits and bobs of data from my computer
[01:22:03.920 --> 01:22:08.760]   to Google Analytics, including aggregate usage data technical session information about
[01:22:08.760 --> 01:22:13.960]   my hardware device, the half of my heart that cares about privacy sank, the other half
[01:22:13.960 --> 01:22:18.160]   of my heart, the half that enjoys snooping on snoopers, and figuring out what they're
[01:22:18.160 --> 01:22:19.160]   up to left.
[01:22:19.160 --> 01:22:20.160]   This is a great post.
[01:22:20.160 --> 01:22:21.720]   It is-- you read the post.
[01:22:21.720 --> 01:22:29.080]   Yeah, so it turns out whack-um sends back-- and he had it, by the way, do some real rigmarole.
[01:22:29.080 --> 01:22:30.080]   Wire shark.
[01:22:30.080 --> 01:22:31.880]   Wire shark and burp.
[01:22:31.880 --> 01:22:37.840]   He was able, though, to figure out that the burp suite, that they were sending information
[01:22:37.840 --> 01:22:43.920]   about every single application he opened back to the home office.
[01:22:43.920 --> 01:22:45.960]   He thought that was a bit of a violation.
[01:22:45.960 --> 01:22:50.920]   Now it turns out you don't have to-- you can block it and the tablet works.
[01:22:50.920 --> 01:22:53.720]   He says, basically, this tablet is a glorified mouse.
[01:22:53.720 --> 01:22:56.520]   Why does it need to tell the home office--
[01:22:56.520 --> 01:22:59.120]   They're not there writing software around these applications.
[01:22:59.120 --> 01:23:03.960]   Well, very good, Mr. Morro Panic, because it is a point.
[01:23:03.960 --> 01:23:07.800]   The whack-um tablet changes its behavior depending on what app you're writing.
[01:23:07.800 --> 01:23:08.800]   Right.
[01:23:08.800 --> 01:23:10.160]   That's correct.
[01:23:10.160 --> 01:23:13.240]   So Morro Panic or privacy violation?
[01:23:13.240 --> 01:23:15.240]   You'll be the judge.
[01:23:15.240 --> 01:23:16.240]   It's Panic.
[01:23:16.240 --> 01:23:17.240]   Why can't I answer?
[01:23:17.240 --> 01:23:18.240]   And it's also--
[01:23:18.240 --> 01:23:20.840]   You opt in on that, too.
[01:23:20.840 --> 01:23:22.280]   Yeah, they do tell them.
[01:23:22.280 --> 01:23:24.280]   And if you opt out, you still can use the whack.
[01:23:24.280 --> 01:23:25.280]   Still can use it.
[01:23:25.280 --> 01:23:26.280]   Yeah.
[01:23:26.280 --> 01:23:27.280]   Probably not as well.
[01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:33.880]   So this is one of the reasons why I was upset with EFF, with their ring investigation,
[01:23:33.880 --> 01:23:36.600]   where they were like, they're sending data to Google Analytics.
[01:23:36.600 --> 01:23:39.600]   I'm like, yeah, I'm not going to get upset about that.
[01:23:39.600 --> 01:23:44.080]   That is device behavior so you can adapt and make sure things perform well.
[01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:46.040]   And do I think you should disclose?
[01:23:46.040 --> 01:23:47.040]   Yes.
[01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:48.040]   But--
[01:23:48.040 --> 01:23:49.040]   And if you want a more--
[01:23:49.040 --> 01:23:50.040]   No, we'll have to.
[01:23:50.040 --> 01:23:54.080]   I mean, isn't that part of the California privacy protections in the GDPR?
[01:23:54.080 --> 01:23:56.720]   You have to say when you're gathering that kind of data.
[01:23:56.720 --> 01:23:57.720]   I think so.
[01:23:57.720 --> 01:24:01.680]   If you have a California citizen, but I'm not a California citizen.
[01:24:01.680 --> 01:24:05.600]   Well, but I'm not going to spend the energy to figure out if your California citizen or
[01:24:05.600 --> 01:24:06.600]   not before disclosing.
[01:24:06.600 --> 01:24:08.960]   So it has the effect of disclosure.
[01:24:08.960 --> 01:24:15.440]   It would actually be quite easy to figure out if I am a California citizen.
[01:24:15.440 --> 01:24:16.440]   I mean, it would.
[01:24:16.440 --> 01:24:17.440]   You could be a problem.
[01:24:17.440 --> 01:24:19.440]   If you could use it in VPN, I wouldn't know.
[01:24:19.440 --> 01:24:20.440]   Oh, OK.
[01:24:20.440 --> 01:24:21.440]   Yeah.
[01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:22.440]   Yeah.
[01:24:22.440 --> 01:24:23.440]   Or your ISP.
[01:24:23.440 --> 01:24:24.440]   Yeah.
[01:24:24.440 --> 01:24:27.600]   And IP geolocation is notoriously bad.
[01:24:27.600 --> 01:24:31.680]   For how long in the early days did every site think we were all from Virginia?
[01:24:31.680 --> 01:24:32.920]   Because we went through AOL.
[01:24:32.920 --> 01:24:33.920]   Right, exactly.
[01:24:33.920 --> 01:24:34.920]   Right.
[01:24:34.920 --> 01:24:35.920]   Sure.
[01:24:35.920 --> 01:24:36.920]   Anyway, I think you're right.
[01:24:36.920 --> 01:24:37.920]   I think it's moral panic.
[01:24:37.920 --> 01:24:38.920]   But it was an interesting story.
[01:24:38.920 --> 01:24:39.920]   And actually--
[01:24:39.920 --> 01:24:40.920]   You want to know what I'm panicking about?
[01:24:40.920 --> 01:24:41.920]   What?
[01:24:41.920 --> 01:24:47.280]   So Britain has decided that off-com, the broadcast regulator is now going to regulate speech
[01:24:47.280 --> 01:24:48.280]   on the internet.
[01:24:48.280 --> 01:24:49.280]   Oh, that's not good.
[01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:50.280]   Oh, dear.
[01:24:50.280 --> 01:24:52.480]   That's like given the FCC regulation.
[01:24:52.480 --> 01:24:58.280]   Imagine if you could use the seven dirty words while you're at home.
[01:24:58.280 --> 01:24:59.280]   Roto.
[01:24:59.280 --> 01:25:00.280]   Roto.
[01:25:00.280 --> 01:25:02.280]   It'd be like the good place.
[01:25:02.280 --> 01:25:05.280]   Shout out the front door.
[01:25:05.280 --> 01:25:07.280]   I still haven't started watching that show yet.
[01:25:07.280 --> 01:25:09.280]   Oh, and it's so delightful.
[01:25:09.280 --> 01:25:10.280]   It's so cool.
[01:25:10.280 --> 01:25:11.280]   Of all people.
[01:25:11.280 --> 01:25:12.280]   I've been trying to cue it up.
[01:25:12.280 --> 01:25:13.280]   I haven't gotten around to it though.
[01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:14.280]   I'm watching quick.
[01:25:14.280 --> 01:25:16.680]   It's going to get taken off of Netflix pretty soon.
[01:25:16.680 --> 01:25:17.680]   Oh, is it?
[01:25:17.680 --> 01:25:18.680]   Yeah.
[01:25:18.680 --> 01:25:19.680]   Because it's a movie in the UK.
[01:25:19.680 --> 01:25:21.360]   It's going to become part of peacock.
[01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:25.480]   So do you think they're not going to get season four and I should just buy it?
[01:25:25.480 --> 01:25:26.480]   I did.
[01:25:26.480 --> 01:25:27.480]   She saw I could do it.
[01:25:27.480 --> 01:25:28.480]   That is, by the way, my solution.
[01:25:28.480 --> 01:25:34.480]   If a show is that good, instead of subscribing to some focacca service, I'll pay for forever.
[01:25:34.480 --> 01:25:35.480]   What's that word again?
[01:25:35.480 --> 01:25:36.480]   focacca.
[01:25:36.480 --> 01:25:39.480]   It's like kakalaki, only different.
[01:25:39.480 --> 01:25:41.920]   It's a little reddish.
[01:25:41.920 --> 01:25:45.080]   I would just buy this show.
[01:25:45.080 --> 01:25:46.080]   Right?
[01:25:46.080 --> 01:25:51.200]   There's a show that I haven't watched in all honesty, a PBS show in years.
[01:25:51.200 --> 01:25:55.680]   There's a PBS show about Germany after the war that I actually want to watch.
[01:25:55.680 --> 01:26:02.080]   The only way I can watch it is if I sign up for a full year of contribution to PBS.
[01:26:02.080 --> 01:26:03.080]   PBS does that.
[01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:04.080]   Yeah.
[01:26:04.080 --> 01:26:05.080]   Sorry.
[01:26:05.080 --> 01:26:06.080]   No, I'd buy the show.
[01:26:06.080 --> 01:26:07.080]   I'd pay for the show.
[01:26:07.080 --> 01:26:08.080]   Fun.
[01:26:08.080 --> 01:26:11.080]   I bought eyes on the prize, but that's a PBS show.
[01:26:11.080 --> 01:26:12.080]   Yeah.
[01:26:12.080 --> 01:26:17.000]   For a long time, HBO wouldn't, you couldn't buy the sopranos until a year after it aired
[01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:18.000]   and stuff.
[01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.200]   That's just throwing money away, really.
[01:26:20.200 --> 01:26:21.200]   Right?
[01:26:21.200 --> 01:26:22.200]   They're getting better at that, though.
[01:26:22.200 --> 01:26:23.200]   Yeah, I think they are.
[01:26:23.200 --> 01:26:25.760]   There's a lot of stuff I can buy on Amazon now.
[01:26:25.760 --> 01:26:26.760]   That's right.
[01:26:26.760 --> 01:26:29.880]   A lot of movies come as soon as they're on DVD, I can buy them on Amazon.
[01:26:29.880 --> 01:26:30.880]   As it should be.
[01:26:30.880 --> 01:26:31.880]   Right.
[01:26:31.880 --> 01:26:32.880]   Yeah, I can rent them.
[01:26:32.880 --> 01:26:33.880]   But I can't watch them.
[01:26:33.880 --> 01:26:36.480]   I can rent them soon after.
[01:26:36.480 --> 01:26:38.880]   It goes to sale first and then two weeks later, usually.
[01:26:38.880 --> 01:26:44.400]   They're so smart because they know how impatient I am.
[01:26:44.400 --> 01:26:48.200]   The rational aisle as well would have cost more to see in the theater, so I'm just going
[01:26:48.200 --> 01:26:49.200]   to buy it.
[01:26:49.200 --> 01:26:50.200]   Yeah.
[01:26:50.200 --> 01:26:51.200]   Yeah.
[01:26:51.200 --> 01:26:53.200]   But what if I got really?
[01:26:53.200 --> 01:26:54.200]   Right?
[01:26:54.200 --> 01:26:55.200]   I don't have a DVD.
[01:26:55.200 --> 01:26:56.600]   I don't have anything.
[01:26:56.600 --> 01:26:57.880]   That could be yanked away for me.
[01:26:57.880 --> 01:26:58.880]   But you don't need it?
[01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:00.280]   So I don't really own it.
[01:27:00.280 --> 01:27:01.280]   No, I don't need it.
[01:27:01.280 --> 01:27:05.080]   No, if I want to watch a show, I just want to pay to watch the show.
[01:27:05.080 --> 01:27:06.080]   Right.
[01:27:06.080 --> 01:27:08.680]   I get everything back in my day.
[01:27:08.680 --> 01:27:09.680]   Yeah, boy.
[01:27:09.680 --> 01:27:10.680]   Oh, Jesus.
[01:27:10.680 --> 01:27:13.880]   I just don't want to turn it into me.
[01:27:13.880 --> 01:27:15.600]   Is that what's going on?
[01:27:15.600 --> 01:27:18.320]   Where did you put his metamorphosis?
[01:27:18.320 --> 01:27:20.000]   He's going through the metamorphosis.
[01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:21.640]   He's going to shed his skin.
[01:27:21.640 --> 01:27:22.640]   What drugs is he taking?
[01:27:22.640 --> 01:27:23.640]   No, actually the truth is...
[01:27:23.640 --> 01:27:24.880]   I'm in a manic phase this week.
[01:27:24.880 --> 01:27:25.880]   I'm sorry.
[01:27:25.880 --> 01:27:29.560]   The truth is he's the next clone.
[01:27:29.560 --> 01:27:33.280]   And there is a certain amount of training that involved.
[01:27:33.280 --> 01:27:36.280]   And then... Oh, I thought Ant was the next clone.
[01:27:36.280 --> 01:27:38.560]   He's the next but one.
[01:27:38.560 --> 01:27:40.800]   So we have to constantly have a chain.
[01:27:40.800 --> 01:27:43.120]   You're the spare, not the air.
[01:27:43.120 --> 01:27:46.160]   He's the spare, not the air.
[01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:47.480]   Did you just make that up?
[01:27:47.480 --> 01:27:48.480]   That's very good.
[01:27:48.480 --> 01:27:49.480]   Where's that title?
[01:27:49.480 --> 01:27:51.480]   That's the UK monarchy.
[01:27:51.480 --> 01:27:53.920]   It's the air and the spare.
[01:27:53.920 --> 01:27:55.280]   The air and the spare.
[01:27:55.280 --> 01:27:57.400]   I like it.
[01:27:57.400 --> 01:27:58.800]   So Andrew's the spare.
[01:27:58.800 --> 01:27:59.800]   No, no.
[01:27:59.800 --> 01:28:00.800]   Who's the spare?
[01:28:00.800 --> 01:28:02.600]   Harry's the air.
[01:28:02.600 --> 01:28:03.600]   And then...
[01:28:03.600 --> 01:28:04.600]   Who's the spare?
[01:28:04.600 --> 01:28:05.600]   No, Will's the air.
[01:28:05.600 --> 01:28:06.600]   Harry's the spare.
[01:28:06.600 --> 01:28:07.600]   Yeah.
[01:28:07.600 --> 01:28:08.600]   Okay.
[01:28:08.600 --> 01:28:12.440]   Is the car from the Sea Today, the car from the clone?
[01:28:12.440 --> 01:28:13.840]   He's the clone but he hasn't shed his skin.
[01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:15.320]   He has the metamorphosis will happen.
[01:28:15.320 --> 01:28:16.320]   The beard will fall off.
[01:28:16.320 --> 01:28:17.320]   Oh, okay.
[01:28:17.320 --> 01:28:20.240]   Wait, is it a true metamorphosis?
[01:28:20.240 --> 01:28:21.480]   You don't actually want to watch it.
[01:28:21.480 --> 01:28:23.240]   They're a little slimy when they first...
[01:28:23.240 --> 01:28:24.240]   No, no, no.
[01:28:24.240 --> 01:28:27.160]   When the bow tie comes off, it all oozes out.
[01:28:27.160 --> 01:28:31.080]   The bow tie.
[01:28:31.080 --> 01:28:34.160]   The bow tie is actually holding the chrysalis together.
[01:28:34.160 --> 01:28:37.240]   If you pull the bow tie, the whole thing just...
[01:28:37.240 --> 01:28:39.080]   Shh, oh, this goes.
[01:28:39.080 --> 01:28:42.440]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:28:42.440 --> 01:28:43.840]   Look, he really ties them.
[01:28:43.840 --> 01:28:44.840]   We're not ready for it.
[01:28:44.840 --> 01:28:45.840]   It's not a clip on.
[01:28:45.840 --> 01:28:46.840]   We're not ready now.
[01:28:46.840 --> 01:28:47.840]   Wow.
[01:28:47.840 --> 01:28:48.840]   So really, we've...
[01:28:48.840 --> 01:28:49.840]   We've never seen it untied.
[01:28:49.840 --> 01:28:50.840]   Off come...
[01:28:50.840 --> 01:28:51.840]   What is off come?
[01:28:51.840 --> 01:28:52.840]   Who is off come?
[01:28:52.840 --> 01:28:55.640]   Off come is the British broadcast regulator.
[01:28:55.640 --> 01:28:58.560]   So they're the FCC or the CRTC of Great Britain.
[01:28:58.560 --> 01:29:02.880]   What they're gonna use is the online harms report, which I was screaming about before,
[01:29:02.880 --> 01:29:08.960]   which is not only gonna have you take down illegal content, but legal and harmful content.
[01:29:08.960 --> 01:29:11.120]   And the platform is a duty of care.
[01:29:11.120 --> 01:29:14.640]   It could be legal, but it's still harmful and it gets taken.
[01:29:14.640 --> 01:29:19.320]   So the model that somebody said today was, it's like whole foods having a duty of care
[01:29:19.320 --> 01:29:22.400]   to stop you from getting that cheese.
[01:29:22.400 --> 01:29:24.280]   Oh, Lord.
[01:29:24.280 --> 01:29:25.520]   But I want that cheese.
[01:29:25.520 --> 01:29:27.000]   Well, it's bad for you.
[01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:28.000]   No, but it's good.
[01:29:28.000 --> 01:29:29.000]   I don't care to stop you.
[01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:30.000]   It tastes good.
[01:29:30.000 --> 01:29:32.600]   Because if I don't stop you, I'm gonna get fined, maybe even shut down.
[01:29:32.600 --> 01:29:34.400]   My CEO might go to jail.
[01:29:34.400 --> 01:29:35.400]   Oh my God.
[01:29:35.400 --> 01:29:38.960]   Not because you did anything illegal or I did anything illegal, just because some nanny
[01:29:38.960 --> 01:29:41.400]   somewhere thought it was harmful.
[01:29:41.400 --> 01:29:46.440]   According to The Guardian, these new regulations apply only to companies that allow the sharing
[01:29:46.440 --> 01:29:48.640]   of user generated content.
[01:29:48.640 --> 01:29:49.640]   So space book Twitter.
[01:29:49.640 --> 01:29:57.520]   Because our speech is now, you know, obviously dangerous to democracy A, B, that content can
[01:29:57.520 --> 01:30:01.720]   include news in your shows and anything else.
[01:30:01.720 --> 01:30:06.280]   So it doesn't include my show because there's, I don't allow the sharing of user generated
[01:30:06.280 --> 01:30:07.920]   content.
[01:30:07.920 --> 01:30:09.560]   So your show is shared.
[01:30:09.560 --> 01:30:12.280]   Oh, and it is deemed to be harmful.
[01:30:12.280 --> 01:30:16.840]   Then Twitter could be responsible, but you're, you get taken down because critters, so that
[01:30:16.840 --> 01:30:18.600]   not the agencies.
[01:30:18.600 --> 01:30:20.480]   Carson's been saying this all day.
[01:30:20.480 --> 01:30:21.480]   That's dangerous.
[01:30:21.480 --> 01:30:27.280]   Carson's been telling me it's just a matter of time before podcasts, you know, get, get
[01:30:27.280 --> 01:30:29.000]   taken off.
[01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:32.960]   I don't know what he's got some sort of thing that I keep people from downloading the shows.
[01:30:32.960 --> 01:30:33.960]   Other people's content.
[01:30:33.960 --> 01:30:34.960]   Oh my God.
[01:30:34.960 --> 01:30:35.960]   He's changing.
[01:30:35.960 --> 01:30:39.600]   We will, we will get our podcast taken down.
[01:30:39.600 --> 01:30:42.080]   If he sounds a little muffled is because the chrysalis is slipping.
[01:30:42.080 --> 01:30:44.280]   It's the reason that YouTube's being taken down.
[01:30:44.280 --> 01:30:45.280]   Yeah.
[01:30:45.280 --> 01:30:46.520]   That is really a terrifying mask.
[01:30:46.520 --> 01:30:47.520]   What they can look at it.
[01:30:47.520 --> 01:30:49.520]   Carson, why do you have?
[01:30:49.520 --> 01:30:51.520]   Oh, that's a good question.
[01:30:51.520 --> 01:30:52.520]   They're inducing.
[01:30:52.520 --> 01:30:54.520]   That's a really good question.
[01:30:54.520 --> 01:30:57.520]   This is the real me without the bow talk.
[01:30:57.520 --> 01:30:58.520]   Okay.
[01:30:58.520 --> 01:31:00.640]   I told you, don't go talk.
[01:31:00.640 --> 01:31:02.040]   Don't pull on the bow.
[01:31:02.040 --> 01:31:04.040]   The bow talk.
[01:31:04.040 --> 01:31:11.000]   I think, wait a minute.
[01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:12.240]   Somehow I'm getting old stories.
[01:31:12.240 --> 01:31:13.240]   Am I looking at the right one?
[01:31:13.240 --> 01:31:14.240]   No idea.
[01:31:14.240 --> 01:31:15.240]   We did last week.
[01:31:15.240 --> 01:31:16.240]   We did.
[01:31:16.240 --> 01:31:17.240]   Didn't we do Mike Bloomberg paying influencers last week?
[01:31:17.240 --> 01:31:18.720]   I think we did.
[01:31:18.720 --> 01:31:20.720]   I think we did.
[01:31:20.720 --> 01:31:24.680]   Oh, we don't have any advertisements?
[01:31:24.680 --> 01:31:28.240]   Are we taking our political stance again?
[01:31:28.240 --> 01:31:29.240]   Yes, we are.
[01:31:29.240 --> 01:31:30.240]   We have to rub that in.
[01:31:30.240 --> 01:31:32.720]   No, I was, you don't be.
[01:31:32.720 --> 01:31:35.160]   I'm trying to keep it up like should we be doing it?
[01:31:35.160 --> 01:31:38.640]   Is your podcast ever air without advertising?
[01:31:38.640 --> 01:31:41.400]   Um, like ever?
[01:31:41.400 --> 01:31:42.400]   I think.
[01:31:42.400 --> 01:31:44.920]   No, the answer is no.
[01:31:44.920 --> 01:31:46.400]   You always have ads.
[01:31:46.400 --> 01:31:49.080]   Yeah, very rarely.
[01:31:49.080 --> 01:31:51.040]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:31:51.040 --> 01:31:53.000]   Give me down her.
[01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:54.000]   Thanks a lot.
[01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:55.000]   I definitely need it.
[01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:57.000]   We're going to move right down.
[01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:00.000]   They could, it's all sad.
[01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:01.000]   Good work Stacy.
[01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:04.120]   Well, I think the market has spoken.
[01:32:04.120 --> 01:32:05.800]   That's all I'm just saying.
[01:32:05.800 --> 01:32:06.800]   The market does.
[01:32:06.800 --> 01:32:07.800]   It's a farewell show.
[01:32:07.800 --> 01:32:10.080]   Yeah, it's been fun.
[01:32:10.080 --> 01:32:11.680]   It's fun, but it was over.
[01:32:11.680 --> 01:32:13.640]   We'll Spotify ruin.
[01:32:13.640 --> 01:32:17.440]   I have started reading Matt Stoller's big blog because he talks about monopoly.
[01:32:17.440 --> 01:32:21.480]   I don't know if it's good or not, but I enjoy reading it.
[01:32:21.480 --> 01:32:24.080]   I really enjoy reading it.
[01:32:24.080 --> 01:32:30.760]   His newest piece has contains an interesting thesis that I wanted to run by you, particularly
[01:32:30.760 --> 01:32:37.200]   you Jeff will Spotify ruin podcasting.
[01:32:37.200 --> 01:32:42.720]   And what he's likening podcasting to is the golden days of the internet.
[01:32:42.720 --> 01:32:44.720]   2000 to 2006.
[01:32:44.720 --> 01:32:45.720]   Logs.
[01:32:45.720 --> 01:32:46.720]   Logs.
[01:32:46.720 --> 01:32:54.760]   If you built a highly trafficked web property, you could finance yourself by selling advertising.
[01:32:54.760 --> 01:32:57.200]   It was a three tiered system.
[01:32:57.200 --> 01:33:00.440]   Production, distribution and advertising operate in vertically separated layers.
[01:33:00.440 --> 01:33:03.880]   By the way, this is very similar to the podcast market.
[01:33:03.880 --> 01:33:04.880]   Yep, today.
[01:33:04.880 --> 01:33:05.880]   Sounds very fair.
[01:33:05.880 --> 01:33:09.240]   There were some industry players like the New York Times, which both distributed and sold
[01:33:09.240 --> 01:33:10.240]   its own ads.
[01:33:10.240 --> 01:33:13.280]   One had dominant power in any one layer.
[01:33:13.280 --> 01:33:23.120]   However, a long come Google and Facebook and what happened, why the open web and publishing
[01:33:23.120 --> 01:33:29.240]   began dying, what happened was their advertising companies, their middlemen in the flow of
[01:33:29.240 --> 01:33:35.520]   information, Google gets 80% of its revenue from ads for Facebook 98%.
[01:33:35.520 --> 01:33:41.720]   And what they did from 2004 to 2014 was, if this is the question for you, if this is
[01:33:41.720 --> 01:33:46.720]   an accurate description of this, because I believe you were there, was to redirect the
[01:33:46.720 --> 01:33:50.040]   flow of ad money from publishers to themselves.
[01:33:50.040 --> 01:33:55.240]   His thesis is by acquiring gatekeeping power and distribution.
[01:33:55.240 --> 01:33:58.920]   Google is a gatekeeper in search online video and maps, Facebook, a gatekeeper and social
[01:33:58.920 --> 01:34:00.080]   networking.
[01:34:00.080 --> 01:34:06.520]   So this is the thesis, to get to users you got to go through Google and Facebook.
[01:34:06.520 --> 01:34:11.120]   And what happened was advertisers started to realize, well, if I want those valuable
[01:34:11.120 --> 01:34:14.880]   New York Times readers, I could buy an ad in New York Times, but wouldn't it be easier
[01:34:14.880 --> 01:34:19.840]   just to buy the search results from Google at a lower cost and still get the same views,
[01:34:19.840 --> 01:34:26.640]   same eyeballs, the money flows instead of flowing to the New York Times flows to Google.
[01:34:26.640 --> 01:34:30.040]   In fact, that's why the New York Times no longer relies on ad revenue.
[01:34:30.040 --> 01:34:37.680]   They've really worked hard to beef up revenue through subscriptions.
[01:34:37.680 --> 01:34:41.920]   And they're doing a pretty good job of it, but that's not a viable playbook for a lot
[01:34:41.920 --> 01:34:45.640]   of journalism and publishing.
[01:34:45.640 --> 01:34:49.160]   When most users going through either Google properties or Facebook properties, corporations
[01:34:49.160 --> 01:34:53.080]   could de-commodify the ad value of a publisher ad slot.
[01:34:53.080 --> 01:34:57.400]   No need to advertise in the Times, just buy it on Google.
[01:34:57.400 --> 01:35:02.320]   So first of all, does that, I mean, that sounds like a simplification, but is that
[01:35:02.320 --> 01:35:03.320]   roughly?
[01:35:03.320 --> 01:35:08.240]   It's a radical simplification on a few levels.
[01:35:08.240 --> 01:35:13.160]   One is that publishers could have had their own first party data.
[01:35:13.160 --> 01:35:16.280]   They treat people as a mass, as I say often.
[01:35:16.280 --> 01:35:19.480]   And Google and Facebook have data about users.
[01:35:19.480 --> 01:35:20.800]   That data is now useful.
[01:35:20.800 --> 01:35:24.600]   It's that data that modifies the publishers.
[01:35:24.600 --> 01:35:25.600]   Environment doesn't matter anymore.
[01:35:25.600 --> 01:35:31.920]   Data about the user and intent is far more valuable than the proxy that was environment.
[01:35:31.920 --> 01:35:34.240]   I no longer need to.
[01:35:34.240 --> 01:35:38.360]   Not only do I not need to buy an ad on New York Times to get a New York Times reader,
[01:35:38.360 --> 01:35:40.040]   I don't even care if it's a New York Times reader.
[01:35:40.040 --> 01:35:43.240]   I want highly educated income over 150,000.
[01:35:43.240 --> 01:35:47.000]   No, I want somebody who's looking at these boots.
[01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:48.000]   Even more.
[01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:49.000]   Even more granny.
[01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.320]   Somebody who's in the market to buy boots tomorrow.
[01:35:51.320 --> 01:35:52.320]   Yeah.
[01:35:52.320 --> 01:35:56.360]   And I know what boots and I want them and I want to get them at the best price in a competitive
[01:35:56.360 --> 01:35:57.360]   marketplace.
[01:35:57.360 --> 01:35:58.360]   Publishers didn't stand a chance in that case.
[01:35:58.360 --> 01:36:00.480]   No way, no chance because they didn't have first party data.
[01:36:00.480 --> 01:36:01.760]   They had no discipline of doing that.
[01:36:01.760 --> 01:36:02.760]   They didn't build products that gathered.
[01:36:02.760 --> 01:36:05.160]   But it wasn't that where mistakes were made.
[01:36:05.160 --> 01:36:06.640]   They couldn't have done that, could they?
[01:36:06.640 --> 01:36:07.640]   No, they could have.
[01:36:07.640 --> 01:36:08.640]   They could have.
[01:36:08.640 --> 01:36:09.640]   No, they could have built product.
[01:36:09.640 --> 01:36:14.480]   I mean, New York Times food knows things about you and food that they can sell directly
[01:36:14.480 --> 01:36:20.920]   with food because they have targeted data about you rather than the problem was we relied
[01:36:20.920 --> 01:36:23.440]   on I have my students always repeat this.
[01:36:23.440 --> 01:36:24.440]   Students?
[01:36:24.440 --> 01:36:26.560]   What's the myth of mass media repeated?
[01:36:26.560 --> 01:36:31.520]   The myth of mass media is that all readers see all ads so we charge all advertisers for
[01:36:31.520 --> 01:36:32.520]   all readers.
[01:36:32.520 --> 01:36:34.120]   I'll say it against students.
[01:36:34.120 --> 01:36:38.560]   All readers see all ads so we charge all advertisers for all readers.
[01:36:38.560 --> 01:36:39.760]   This is a knife to my heart.
[01:36:39.760 --> 01:36:42.800]   So that meant this is class.
[01:36:42.800 --> 01:36:47.200]   So listen closely, it'll be on the final.
[01:36:47.200 --> 01:36:51.480]   So that meant that that is why you had a bridge column in a newspaper and a food section in
[01:36:51.480 --> 01:36:55.360]   a newspaper and the golf section in a newspaper and all that stuff because you wanted every
[01:36:55.360 --> 01:36:58.440]   reader because you charged every reader to every advertiser.
[01:36:58.440 --> 01:37:02.360]   Online came along and not Google, not Facebook online, not that.
[01:37:02.360 --> 01:37:09.280]   Is it enough for us instead of trying to build a podcast network that gets everybody to say
[01:37:09.280 --> 01:37:11.360]   we're going to try for a narrow slice.
[01:37:11.360 --> 01:37:12.360]   Is that enough targeting?
[01:37:12.360 --> 01:37:13.360]   Yes.
[01:37:13.360 --> 01:37:14.360]   Yes.
[01:37:14.360 --> 01:37:16.400]   It depends on narrow your slice or the quality of your narrows.
[01:37:16.400 --> 01:37:18.240]   Our is pretty narrow and it's pretty high quality.
[01:37:18.240 --> 01:37:19.240]   I think.
[01:37:19.240 --> 01:37:21.040]   And it's even more narrow.
[01:37:21.040 --> 01:37:22.040]   So that's right.
[01:37:22.040 --> 01:37:23.040]   Your own IoT users.
[01:37:23.040 --> 01:37:24.040]   Right.
[01:37:24.040 --> 01:37:27.000]   And my advertisers love that.
[01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:33.760]   I may only get like someone may this is a gross exaggeration, but my advertising may
[01:37:33.760 --> 01:37:35.600]   only get 20 clicks, right?
[01:37:35.600 --> 01:37:37.120]   And I charge a lot for it.
[01:37:37.120 --> 01:37:42.400]   In the 20 are people who actually five of them will buy the product.
[01:37:42.400 --> 01:37:44.240]   I buy a huge man.
[01:37:44.240 --> 01:37:47.640]   Ultimately, from an advertiser's point of view, it's all about return on investment.
[01:37:47.640 --> 01:37:51.640]   If I spend a dollar and I make two dollars, winning a good thing.
[01:37:51.640 --> 01:37:52.640]   Right.
[01:37:52.640 --> 01:37:54.080]   So you make targeted products.
[01:37:54.080 --> 01:37:55.960]   You're not mass media either of you.
[01:37:55.960 --> 01:37:56.960]   Right.
[01:37:56.960 --> 01:37:59.480]   But at the New York Times, you know, is it exceptional all rules.
[01:37:59.480 --> 01:38:00.960]   You're the Cleveland Plain dealer.
[01:38:00.960 --> 01:38:03.560]   That's a massive product in a small market.
[01:38:03.560 --> 01:38:04.560]   Yeah.
[01:38:04.560 --> 01:38:07.520]   Well, you have no limit of competition.
[01:38:07.520 --> 01:38:09.160]   No one cares about that.
[01:38:09.160 --> 01:38:10.160]   All right.
[01:38:10.160 --> 01:38:11.160]   All right.
[01:38:11.160 --> 01:38:12.160]   So good.
[01:38:12.160 --> 01:38:13.160]   All right.
[01:38:13.160 --> 01:38:14.160]   That's good.
[01:38:14.160 --> 01:38:15.160]   That's good.
[01:38:15.160 --> 01:38:16.160]   Valuable information.
[01:38:16.160 --> 01:38:17.160]   And let's move on to the Spotify challenge and see what you think of this Spotify, which
[01:38:17.160 --> 01:38:22.640]   has been on a tear acquiring podcast networks that bought Gimlet for $200 million.
[01:38:22.640 --> 01:38:25.280]   They just this is this news story that triggered this column.
[01:38:25.280 --> 01:38:30.000]   They just bought the ringer, which is Bill Simmons smaller network, 30 podcasts, but
[01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:32.600]   it's all sports, although there is some society stuff.
[01:38:32.600 --> 01:38:33.600]   He does a movie podcast.
[01:38:33.600 --> 01:38:35.520]   You watch a movie with him and stuff.
[01:38:35.520 --> 01:38:40.960]   The CEO of Spotify, Daniel Eck said, we've bought the next ESPN.
[01:38:40.960 --> 01:38:43.960]   Like this is if you know, this is going to be as valuable as ESPN.
[01:38:43.960 --> 01:38:45.680]   We don't know how much they spent figure.
[01:38:45.680 --> 01:38:51.160]   It's probably a hundred million or more, at least for a company with 30 podcasts, 90 employees
[01:38:51.160 --> 01:38:55.600]   and revenue of about 18 million a year.
[01:38:55.600 --> 01:39:03.240]   Spotify is rolling up the internet audio market says this column and they're willing
[01:39:03.240 --> 01:39:06.640]   to spend half a billion dollars to do it over the last six years.
[01:39:06.640 --> 01:39:13.720]   They bought 15 companies, all of which are about data analytics, music and audio production,
[01:39:13.720 --> 01:39:17.720]   audio ads, licensing, podcasting networks.
[01:39:17.720 --> 01:39:23.280]   And his contention is that, you know, right now podcasting is based on RSS is a free and
[01:39:23.280 --> 01:39:24.280]   open platform.
[01:39:24.280 --> 01:39:26.960]   You make an RSS feed, you're a podcast.
[01:39:26.960 --> 01:39:27.960]   Thank you.
[01:39:27.960 --> 01:39:28.960]   Yes.
[01:39:28.960 --> 01:39:29.960]   Thank you, Dave Weiner.
[01:39:29.960 --> 01:39:32.480]   What spotify wants to do is eliminate that.
[01:39:32.480 --> 01:39:33.480]   Their effect.
[01:39:33.480 --> 01:39:34.960]   One could argue they're not even doing podcasts.
[01:39:34.960 --> 01:39:38.520]   They're doing any more than Netflix is doing podcasts.
[01:39:38.520 --> 01:39:42.040]   They're doing like this is like this is like this is what happened to blogs.
[01:39:42.040 --> 01:39:43.040]   Right.
[01:39:43.040 --> 01:39:44.040]   They're doing.
[01:39:44.040 --> 01:39:47.080]   Yeah, they aggregated into larger platforms like medium.
[01:39:47.080 --> 01:39:53.280]   So Spotify, by the way, he said, you know, Spotify, no other company is Spotify's scaling
[01:39:53.280 --> 01:39:54.640]   audience around the globe seven.
[01:39:54.640 --> 01:39:55.640]   And this is Daniel.
[01:39:55.640 --> 01:39:58.280]   Like again, 78 markets where we do business.
[01:39:58.280 --> 01:40:00.320]   No other company has the two sided marketplace.
[01:40:00.320 --> 01:40:04.760]   We've built a spotify that benefits both artists and creators, along with consumers.
[01:40:04.760 --> 01:40:05.760]   Nobody else has both anyway.
[01:40:05.760 --> 01:40:07.760]   He goes on to make the pitch.
[01:40:07.760 --> 01:40:13.280]   What they really want to do is privatize open standards, take over the already large
[01:40:13.280 --> 01:40:15.680]   public commons.
[01:40:15.680 --> 01:40:17.720]   And here's the pressure point they have.
[01:40:17.720 --> 01:40:23.200]   They can go to advertisers and say, we know more because we're like Google and Facebook.
[01:40:23.200 --> 01:40:24.200]   We are the gatekeeper.
[01:40:24.200 --> 01:40:27.440]   We know everything about the audience because they have to listen.
[01:40:27.440 --> 01:40:30.800]   RSS, we don't know anything, but Spotify.
[01:40:30.800 --> 01:40:35.760]   Matt Stoller says, you know what proportion of the revenue of Spotify is ad versus sub?
[01:40:35.760 --> 01:40:37.520]   I'm sure I could find that.
[01:40:37.520 --> 01:40:40.400]   He's I think they've talked about that a little bit.
[01:40:40.400 --> 01:40:44.720]   They have a free ad supported version and they have a subscriber version version.
[01:40:44.720 --> 01:40:49.440]   But by the way, there's not no ads and podcasts in the subscriber paid version.
[01:40:49.440 --> 01:40:51.840]   I think those still podcast still have ads in them.
[01:40:51.840 --> 01:40:52.840]   Right.
[01:40:52.840 --> 01:41:03.240]   So, I think the Spotify challenge is they could, their goal probably is to put RSS style podcasting
[01:41:03.240 --> 01:41:04.840]   out of business.
[01:41:04.840 --> 01:41:09.120]   And they feel like the pressure that they can exert is we can give the advertisers a
[01:41:09.120 --> 01:41:13.680]   better value proposition because we know everything about the listener.
[01:41:13.680 --> 01:41:16.600]   Well, we can verify that they listen.
[01:41:16.600 --> 01:41:18.600]   We can verify that they listen.
[01:41:18.600 --> 01:41:23.000]   Right now, you know, this is hard for us because people say, well, did they hear the
[01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:24.000]   ad?
[01:41:24.000 --> 01:41:25.000]   I don't know.
[01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:26.000]   Oh, right.
[01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:28.640]   Oh, revenue at Spotify is 1.86 billion euros.
[01:41:28.640 --> 01:41:30.240]   That's total revenue.
[01:41:30.240 --> 01:41:31.880]   That's up 24%.
[01:41:31.880 --> 01:41:35.840]   Ad supported revenue is 217 million of those euros.
[01:41:35.840 --> 01:41:39.560]   Oh, so a big portion of it is subscriber more than 80%.
[01:41:39.560 --> 01:41:41.560]   Yes, I showed 90%.
[01:41:41.560 --> 01:41:42.560]   90%.
[01:41:42.560 --> 01:41:43.560]   Yeah.
[01:41:43.560 --> 01:41:45.600]   So their goal isn't the advertising data.
[01:41:45.600 --> 01:41:48.840]   Their goal is to be whom come Netflix?
[01:41:48.840 --> 01:41:52.640]   No, I disagree because they have the Netflix problem.
[01:41:52.640 --> 01:41:57.680]   Remember the movie companies started pulling out their A list quality content and Spotify
[01:41:57.680 --> 01:41:58.640]   is going to have that problems.
[01:41:58.640 --> 01:42:00.200]   They live and die by the record industry.
[01:42:00.200 --> 01:42:02.880]   The record could kill them.
[01:42:02.880 --> 01:42:08.240]   So they want to be in, they want to be the place to go for not music, but for audio,
[01:42:08.240 --> 01:42:09.240]   period.
[01:42:09.240 --> 01:42:10.240]   Right.
[01:42:10.240 --> 01:42:13.200]   And they can own podcasting in a way that they can on the record industry.
[01:42:13.200 --> 01:42:16.920]   So I think it's too, it's a defensive move.
[01:42:16.920 --> 01:42:21.360]   Just as Netflix started making original content for the same reason, they have to do that
[01:42:21.360 --> 01:42:22.360]   to predict.
[01:42:22.360 --> 01:42:23.360]   Yeah.
[01:42:23.360 --> 01:42:31.200]   They said in their earnings, which they did earnings last week, this week, this, no,
[01:42:31.200 --> 01:42:33.520]   last week, sorry, I don't know what date is.
[01:42:33.520 --> 01:42:38.320]   They did say that podcasts are having a positive impact on the conversion rate of free to
[01:42:38.320 --> 01:42:40.800]   paid users.
[01:42:40.800 --> 01:42:47.440]   So what Stoller suggests is the Clayton Act, it was passed in 1913.
[01:42:47.440 --> 01:42:48.440]   The Antichrist?
[01:42:48.440 --> 01:42:49.440]   Yeah.
[01:42:49.440 --> 01:42:54.600]   To stop monopolies through mergers, even when such monopolies are in the Sippiancy,
[01:42:54.600 --> 01:42:59.880]   he says the courts could invoke or the FTC could invoke the Clayton Act to block the
[01:42:59.880 --> 01:43:00.880]   ringer mergers.
[01:43:00.880 --> 01:43:02.880]   They're too soon.
[01:43:02.880 --> 01:43:03.880]   Yeah.
[01:43:03.880 --> 01:43:04.880]   Their market share is tiny.
[01:43:04.880 --> 01:43:05.880]   They'll never happen.
[01:43:05.880 --> 01:43:06.880]   They'll never win.
[01:43:06.880 --> 01:43:09.880]   Well, they can do it with the clannax says, even if it's an incipient market.
[01:43:09.880 --> 01:43:10.880]   You're right.
[01:43:10.880 --> 01:43:11.880]   You got too many other players.
[01:43:11.880 --> 01:43:16.560]   And your players who, you know, has Amazon blown this as audible blown this?
[01:43:16.560 --> 01:43:18.720]   Well, more of the point.
[01:43:18.720 --> 01:43:22.800]   And there were comments on Hacker News about this article that there are plenty of podcasts.
[01:43:22.800 --> 01:43:30.280]   I'll include myself, Marco Arment, who makes a podcast client who are never going to abandon
[01:43:30.280 --> 01:43:31.280]   RSS.
[01:43:31.280 --> 01:43:32.840]   We're not going to become a Spotify exclusive.
[01:43:32.840 --> 01:43:33.840]   Right.
[01:43:33.840 --> 01:43:36.000]   Plus there's Apple as a major.
[01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:38.960]   Unless they offer you a hundred million dollars, right, Leo?
[01:43:38.960 --> 01:43:45.080]   Well, more of the point, unless advertisers, no, no, no, no, it could be worse than that.
[01:43:45.080 --> 01:43:49.480]   If advertisers don't buy ads because they say, well, I'm not going to buy your ads.
[01:43:49.480 --> 01:43:52.000]   I have no idea whether those ads are working.
[01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:53.000]   That's the risk.
[01:43:53.000 --> 01:43:54.000]   Yeah.
[01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.800]   Can I ask a devil's advocate question about that?
[01:43:56.800 --> 01:44:03.120]   Well, since this is going to be your company as soon as you metabolize whatever it is you're
[01:44:03.120 --> 01:44:04.120]   doing.
[01:44:04.120 --> 01:44:09.200]   Well, we try to know as much about our viewers as Spotify does.
[01:44:09.200 --> 01:44:10.840]   Does they both freak?
[01:44:10.840 --> 01:44:12.640]   I don't want to know that.
[01:44:12.640 --> 01:44:13.640]   Why does it?
[01:44:13.640 --> 01:44:16.080]   That's a segue to asking for the damned survey.
[01:44:16.080 --> 01:44:17.080]   No.
[01:44:17.080 --> 01:44:18.080]   Is it?
[01:44:18.080 --> 01:44:19.080]   Well, it could be.
[01:44:19.080 --> 01:44:20.080]   It is a way to the survey.
[01:44:20.080 --> 01:44:24.280]   But the survey is not nearly as good because the survey is voluntary.
[01:44:24.280 --> 01:44:27.200]   It's a selective group.
[01:44:27.200 --> 01:44:32.960]   Are people abandoning Spotify and droves because Spotify knows stuff about them?
[01:44:32.960 --> 01:44:36.320]   No, but here's the thing.
[01:44:36.320 --> 01:44:40.880]   Would they really abandon us because we know that they know some things about them?
[01:44:40.880 --> 01:44:45.720]   That's the test that people like Bill Simmons and Ring are going to try and say, well, what
[01:44:45.720 --> 01:44:47.440]   happens if we go Spotify exclusive?
[01:44:47.440 --> 01:44:49.240]   Do we lose audience?
[01:44:49.240 --> 01:44:53.280]   My suggestion is they will because there's too many other shows.
[01:44:53.280 --> 01:44:56.160]   And nobody wants to be forced to which client they use.
[01:44:56.160 --> 01:44:58.760]   It's in our interest, and this is why, of course, we won't do that.
[01:44:58.760 --> 01:45:02.080]   It's in our interest to be everywhere people want to listen to us.
[01:45:02.080 --> 01:45:03.680]   I want to be on Amazon Echo.
[01:45:03.680 --> 01:45:04.840]   I want to be on YouTube.
[01:45:04.840 --> 01:45:05.840]   I don't want to tell you.
[01:45:05.840 --> 01:45:07.840]   I'm not saying we should be exclusive.
[01:45:07.840 --> 01:45:11.040]   We'd have to be if we wanted to collect that information, we'd have to say, and you could
[01:45:11.040 --> 01:45:13.880]   only listen to Twitter on the Twitter app.
[01:45:13.880 --> 01:45:16.800]   That would have to be the choice because otherwise we can't collect that information.
[01:45:16.800 --> 01:45:21.200]   Podcasters could have come together years and years ago and come up with a standard,
[01:45:21.200 --> 01:45:27.840]   but just like bloggers, just like newspapers too, over the years, we were all independent
[01:45:27.840 --> 01:45:32.400]   minded and didn't want to do that and didn't want to lose the openness of it.
[01:45:32.400 --> 01:45:34.040]   And so we never had that data.
[01:45:34.040 --> 01:45:37.000]   So one who can't come with that data, it's going to be very expensive and responsive
[01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:45.000]   to get that data across a podcast or still a long tail, God bless them.
[01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:49.240]   And there's tons of stuff out there they're not going to buy.
[01:45:49.240 --> 01:45:52.320]   And the people are going to listen to you by other mechanisms, and they're not going
[01:45:52.320 --> 01:45:54.480]   to have that data.
[01:45:54.480 --> 01:45:55.960]   And advertising is a smaller part.
[01:45:55.960 --> 01:46:02.280]   So that's why I'm asking whether there's more of a Netflix play than an ad play.
[01:46:02.280 --> 01:46:03.280]   I don't know.
[01:46:03.280 --> 01:46:04.840]   I mean, I don't know what Spotify's plan is.
[01:46:04.840 --> 01:46:08.960]   I think that there's a virtue in this in a variety of different places, and they don't
[01:46:08.960 --> 01:46:10.240]   really have to make that decision.
[01:46:10.240 --> 01:46:12.160]   They could benefit either way.
[01:46:12.160 --> 01:46:13.960]   But does it hurt us?
[01:46:13.960 --> 01:46:15.640]   I don't even know what it's all I care about.
[01:46:15.640 --> 01:46:16.640]   Yeah, I don't.
[01:46:16.640 --> 01:46:18.480]   Well, I don't want to spy on listeners either, obviously.
[01:46:18.480 --> 01:46:19.480]   I do.
[01:46:19.480 --> 01:46:20.480]   I do.
[01:46:20.480 --> 01:46:22.480]   I want to know what I want to know.
[01:46:22.480 --> 01:46:27.680]   I want to know what our listeners want from us, and I want to be able to tell our advertisers.
[01:46:27.680 --> 01:46:28.680]   What are our listening?
[01:46:28.680 --> 01:46:29.680]   So take a survey, that's the TV.
[01:46:29.680 --> 01:46:30.680]   That's true.
[01:46:30.680 --> 01:46:31.680]   That's true.
[01:46:31.680 --> 01:46:32.680]   That to slash survey 20.
[01:46:32.680 --> 01:46:33.680]   Are we still doing that thing?
[01:46:33.680 --> 01:46:34.680]   We are.
[01:46:34.680 --> 01:46:35.680]   We are.
[01:46:35.680 --> 01:46:36.680]   We are.
[01:46:36.680 --> 01:46:37.680]   That wonderful.
[01:46:37.680 --> 01:46:38.680]   By the way, please help us.
[01:46:38.680 --> 01:46:44.280]   Please, please, please help us please and I will go get like Cameron Tong's battle over
[01:46:44.280 --> 01:46:47.120]   these things because I don't want to spy on our audience.
[01:46:47.120 --> 01:46:51.960]   I'm willing to get that all you're asking them to help you and tell you what they like.
[01:46:51.960 --> 01:46:53.560]   So that's why I'm willing to do it.
[01:46:53.560 --> 01:46:55.040]   I don't want to do it too often.
[01:46:55.040 --> 01:46:56.200]   I'll do it once a year.
[01:46:56.200 --> 01:47:00.840]   I don't want to, but I don't look, I want to make it a pleasant thing to listen to Twit.
[01:47:00.840 --> 01:47:04.520]   Not a not a e-commerce transaction.
[01:47:04.520 --> 01:47:07.080]   I want to make it family.
[01:47:07.080 --> 01:47:08.480]   You're listening because you like us.
[01:47:08.480 --> 01:47:09.480]   We like you.
[01:47:09.480 --> 01:47:10.960]   We're all in this together.
[01:47:10.960 --> 01:47:12.360]   Who cares if we have ads?
[01:47:12.360 --> 01:47:15.040]   I don't need to pay rent, but it's.
[01:47:15.040 --> 01:47:17.840]   But our viewers want us to succeed.
[01:47:17.840 --> 01:47:18.840]   So if we can.
[01:47:18.840 --> 01:47:21.920]   No, I thank you viewers for going to twit.t.t.
[01:47:21.920 --> 01:47:25.280]   #GEO/survey20 and take that.
[01:47:25.280 --> 01:47:26.280]   Thank you.
[01:47:26.280 --> 01:47:27.280]   Take that.
[01:47:27.280 --> 01:47:35.080]   I have some personal animus towards marketing of any kind to success.
[01:47:35.080 --> 01:47:36.080]   All of that stuff.
[01:47:36.080 --> 01:47:37.080]   That's just my own thing.
[01:47:37.080 --> 01:47:38.080]   We know you don't.
[01:47:38.080 --> 01:47:40.640]   Leo 2.0 actually is Leo like 50 per minute.
[01:47:40.640 --> 01:47:45.800]   Well, if this is family, let's look at it on a family scenario.
[01:47:45.800 --> 01:47:48.200]   You have any party at the house with a family.
[01:47:48.200 --> 01:47:49.200]   You know certain family music.
[01:47:49.200 --> 01:47:51.880]   Do you pass the hat at your party?
[01:47:51.880 --> 01:47:52.880]   No, of course not.
[01:47:52.880 --> 01:47:55.320]   What is passing the hat?
[01:47:55.320 --> 01:47:57.720]   You don't say, "Give me five bucks for this party."
[01:47:57.720 --> 01:47:58.720]   No, we don't.
[01:47:58.720 --> 01:47:59.720]   You don't do that.
[01:47:59.720 --> 01:48:00.720]   You don't owe the party.
[01:48:00.720 --> 01:48:01.720]   We don't do that.
[01:48:01.720 --> 01:48:05.760]   But we also throw the party to say, you know, "Cuz and so and so was coming in.
[01:48:05.760 --> 01:48:08.760]   Cuz and so and so likes to have this with their meal.
[01:48:08.760 --> 01:48:12.200]   So we'll get that because we survey to find out.
[01:48:12.200 --> 01:48:14.840]   But you don't go to cousin and say, "Now give me five bucks."
[01:48:14.840 --> 01:48:15.840]   No, we don't do that.
[01:48:15.840 --> 01:48:16.840]   But you're poor.
[01:48:16.840 --> 01:48:17.840]   You do survey.
[01:48:17.840 --> 01:48:18.840]   You do survey.
[01:48:18.840 --> 01:48:20.360]   You'll bring a dish to the party.
[01:48:20.360 --> 01:48:21.360]   Oh yeah.
[01:48:21.360 --> 01:48:22.360]   You can share it.
[01:48:22.360 --> 01:48:23.360]   Yeah, it could be a potluck.
[01:48:23.360 --> 01:48:27.080]   Is Twitter potluck or a restaurant?
[01:48:27.080 --> 01:48:28.080]   Or a chatau?
[01:48:28.080 --> 01:48:30.480]   Yo, we have to stop talking about food.
[01:48:30.480 --> 01:48:32.480]   We're going to wrap this up.
[01:48:32.480 --> 01:48:33.480]   We're done.
[01:48:33.480 --> 01:48:34.480]   I want to know.
[01:48:34.480 --> 01:48:35.480]   I want to know.
[01:48:35.480 --> 01:48:36.480]   Yes.
[01:48:36.480 --> 01:48:39.200]   Carson was so uncomfortable he had to re-tie the tie.
[01:48:39.200 --> 01:48:40.200]   He did.
[01:48:40.200 --> 01:48:41.200]   He put it back on.
[01:48:41.200 --> 01:48:42.200]   Yes, I actually did.
[01:48:42.200 --> 01:48:44.600]   I had to walk around without a tie back on.
[01:48:44.600 --> 01:48:45.600]   It's in the bag.
[01:48:45.600 --> 01:48:46.840]   Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[01:48:46.840 --> 01:48:48.840]   You don't want to want to really want to know.
[01:48:48.840 --> 01:48:49.840]   Tell me what you want.
[01:48:49.840 --> 01:48:50.840]   You really, really want to know.
[01:48:50.840 --> 01:48:54.880]   And to untie it and give us video on Carson Cam of his method of tying.
[01:48:54.880 --> 01:48:56.440]   It's just like tying shoes.
[01:48:56.440 --> 01:48:57.800]   We'll make that a twig.
[01:48:57.800 --> 01:48:58.800]   It's a bow.
[01:48:58.800 --> 01:48:59.800]   It's just like tying a shoe.
[01:48:59.800 --> 01:49:00.800]   Here we go.
[01:49:00.800 --> 01:49:01.800]   Here we go.
[01:49:01.800 --> 01:49:02.800]   Okay.
[01:49:02.800 --> 01:49:03.800]   Carson Cam now bow tie.
[01:49:03.800 --> 01:49:04.800]   Get up the wire.
[01:49:04.800 --> 01:49:05.800]   Okay.
[01:49:05.800 --> 01:49:06.800]   Wire.
[01:49:06.800 --> 01:49:07.800]   There you go.
[01:49:07.800 --> 01:49:08.800]   There you go.
[01:49:08.800 --> 01:49:10.200]   The little dog goes through the hole.
[01:49:10.200 --> 01:49:11.200]   It comes out of the hole.
[01:49:11.200 --> 01:49:14.200]   The rabbit bites the mouse's head off.
[01:49:14.200 --> 01:49:15.200]   And there you have it.
[01:49:15.200 --> 01:49:16.200]   It is a bow tie.
[01:49:16.200 --> 01:49:17.200]   Yeah, I can.
[01:49:17.200 --> 01:49:18.200]   I can.
[01:49:18.200 --> 01:49:19.200]   Yes, you can.
[01:49:19.200 --> 01:49:20.200]   Can you tie your shoes, Jeff?
[01:49:20.200 --> 01:49:21.200]   It feels like it.
[01:49:21.200 --> 01:49:23.480]   It's the same thing.
[01:49:23.480 --> 01:49:26.040]   You just have to do it for six months straight.
[01:49:26.040 --> 01:49:27.560]   I sucked at it for six months.
[01:49:27.560 --> 01:49:28.560]   And do it backwards.
[01:49:28.560 --> 01:49:29.560]   You have to do it backwards.
[01:49:29.560 --> 01:49:30.880]   Oh, I did iron your shirt.
[01:49:30.880 --> 01:49:31.880]   He never irises shirt.
[01:49:31.880 --> 01:49:35.840]   Google has filed a trademark.
[01:49:35.840 --> 01:49:36.840]   This is the change log.
[01:49:36.840 --> 01:49:37.840]   Play the bun.
[01:49:37.840 --> 01:49:38.840]   Buns.
[01:49:38.840 --> 01:49:39.840]   Play the buns.
[01:49:39.840 --> 01:49:40.840]   Play the drums.
[01:49:40.840 --> 01:49:41.840]   Buns drums.
[01:49:41.840 --> 01:49:42.840]   Google change log.
[01:49:42.840 --> 01:49:43.840]   The drum buns.
[01:49:43.840 --> 01:49:46.840]   It's time to haul.
[01:49:46.840 --> 01:49:48.200]   I shouldn't mention buns.
[01:49:48.200 --> 01:49:50.080]   She's so hungry.
[01:49:50.080 --> 01:49:56.000]   It's the new operating system from Google is are you ready for the name?
[01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:57.000]   Pigweed.
[01:49:57.000 --> 01:49:58.000]   No.
[01:49:58.000 --> 01:49:59.000]   Why?
[01:49:59.000 --> 01:50:00.000]   Why?
[01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:01.000]   Fcc.
[01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:02.000]   Trademark-slose-reditor-igats.
[01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:13.280]   It was the last sound a human could make that was left.
[01:50:13.280 --> 01:50:20.280]   And it's found that Google has filed a trademark application for the USPTO for the name pigweed.
[01:50:20.280 --> 01:50:25.040]   Google states the pigweed trademark will cover computer operating software.
[01:50:25.040 --> 01:50:27.200]   That's all we know.
[01:50:27.200 --> 01:50:28.200]   But there you have it.
[01:50:28.200 --> 01:50:34.920]   By the way, according to the Brooklyn Botanical Garden, pigweeds, also known as amorants,
[01:50:34.920 --> 01:50:37.920]   are leafy plants that are edible and actually nutritious.
[01:50:37.920 --> 01:50:40.080]   Amorant flower is so gross.
[01:50:40.080 --> 01:50:43.240]   That's the pigweed right there.
[01:50:43.240 --> 01:50:48.640]   Some pigweeds, when fully grown, will actually dry out and form tumbleweeds, spreading their
[01:50:48.640 --> 01:50:51.640]   seeds as they're tossed by the wind.
[01:50:51.640 --> 01:50:53.640]   It's all flowers.
[01:50:53.640 --> 01:50:54.640]   Amorants.
[01:50:54.640 --> 01:50:55.640]   I've had amorants flower.
[01:50:55.640 --> 01:50:56.640]   Yeah.
[01:50:56.640 --> 01:50:58.640]   Not flower like the flowers, but the flowers.
[01:50:58.640 --> 01:50:59.640]   No, no, no, no, no, flower.
[01:50:59.640 --> 01:51:00.640]   You grind it up to make it bread with it.
[01:51:00.640 --> 01:51:01.640]   Oh, yeah.
[01:51:01.640 --> 01:51:02.640]   Okay.
[01:51:02.640 --> 01:51:03.640]   Will you or hippie's Jesus?
[01:51:03.640 --> 01:51:05.640]   It's a paleo people who want to go mad.
[01:51:05.640 --> 01:51:06.640]   It's a paleo thing.
[01:51:06.640 --> 01:51:07.640]   Oh.
[01:51:07.640 --> 01:51:08.640]   It just would understand.
[01:51:08.640 --> 01:51:09.640]   Okay.
[01:51:09.640 --> 01:51:10.640]   Yeah.
[01:51:10.640 --> 01:51:14.440]   I can't talk.
[01:51:14.440 --> 01:51:21.200]   Gluegles, Chrome Adblocker will target three annoying video ads.
[01:51:21.200 --> 01:51:22.520]   This is the ad.
[01:51:22.520 --> 01:51:24.280]   Did you know that Chrome had an adblocker?
[01:51:24.280 --> 01:51:25.280]   Yes.
[01:51:25.280 --> 01:51:26.280]   A standards-backed adblocker.
[01:51:26.280 --> 01:51:28.000]   It's been around the vids.
[01:51:28.000 --> 01:51:29.000]   What?
[01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:30.000]   Yes.
[01:51:30.000 --> 01:51:31.000]   Last year.
[01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:36.560]   Now banning things we all hate like non-skippable pre-roll.
[01:51:36.560 --> 01:51:41.360]   Many group of ads longer than 31 seconds before a video and that cannot be skipped within
[01:51:41.360 --> 01:51:42.680]   the first five seconds.
[01:51:42.680 --> 01:51:44.640]   By the way, who does this benefit?
[01:51:44.640 --> 01:51:45.640]   Google.
[01:51:45.640 --> 01:51:46.640]   Google.
[01:51:46.640 --> 01:51:47.640]   Wait, what happens to YouTube?
[01:51:47.640 --> 01:51:49.520]   There's all kinds of crazy ads before my YouTube video.
[01:51:49.520 --> 01:51:52.000]   But they're skippable, right?
[01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:53.160]   Not all of them.
[01:51:53.160 --> 01:51:54.160]   Some of them are.
[01:51:54.160 --> 01:51:55.160]   Some of them are.
[01:51:55.160 --> 01:51:56.160]   Some of them are.
[01:51:56.160 --> 01:51:57.160]   Some of them are.
[01:51:57.160 --> 01:51:58.160]   Some of them are.
[01:51:58.160 --> 01:51:59.160]   Some of them are.
[01:51:59.160 --> 01:52:00.160]   Some of them are.
[01:52:00.160 --> 01:52:01.160]   Some of them are.
[01:52:01.160 --> 01:52:02.160]   Some of them are.
[01:52:02.160 --> 01:52:03.160]   Some of them are.
[01:52:03.160 --> 01:52:04.160]   Some of them are.
[01:52:04.160 --> 01:52:05.160]   They've been working on this for about a year.
[01:52:05.160 --> 01:52:06.160]   Yeah.
[01:52:06.160 --> 01:52:08.920]   Anyway, all of them.
[01:52:08.920 --> 01:52:14.400]   Any image or text ads that appear on top of a playing video and are in the middle one-third
[01:52:14.400 --> 01:52:19.760]   of the video player window or cover more than 20% of the video content like Jeff Jarvis's
[01:52:19.760 --> 01:52:21.920]   Lower Third, which is actually a lower half.
[01:52:21.920 --> 01:52:23.560]   I'm making a fortune on this.
[01:52:23.560 --> 01:52:26.600]   I'm fortunate I tell you.
[01:52:26.600 --> 01:52:30.160]   The Coalition for Better Ads group has mandated websites.
[01:52:30.160 --> 01:52:33.520]   Stop showing these ads over the next four months or risk losing advertising.
[01:52:33.520 --> 01:52:35.560]   Completely Chrome Enforcement begins.
[01:52:35.560 --> 01:52:36.560]   August 5th.
[01:52:36.560 --> 01:52:37.560]   Wow.
[01:52:37.560 --> 01:52:39.560]   That's a big change.
[01:52:39.560 --> 01:52:45.560]   Google also is moving ahead with his planned band third party cookies.
[01:52:45.560 --> 01:52:47.560]   It's commonly thought of as tracking cookies.
[01:52:47.560 --> 01:52:49.560]   Who wins with that?
[01:52:49.560 --> 01:52:50.560]   Good.
[01:52:50.560 --> 01:52:52.560]   Because they don't need third party cookies.
[01:52:52.560 --> 01:52:56.240]   They know everything else.
[01:52:56.240 --> 01:53:00.480]   But they're saying we talked to, you know, we did surveys of 45,000 users.
[01:53:00.480 --> 01:53:01.880]   This is what they hated.
[01:53:01.880 --> 01:53:03.160]   So we're going to block it.
[01:53:03.160 --> 01:53:09.760]   I think that it's a virtue in it as well.
[01:53:09.760 --> 01:53:17.680]   Google Chrome will also block a variety of file downloads that are potentially hazardous.
[01:53:17.680 --> 01:53:23.840]   HTTP will no longer be usable from EXE to TXT.
[01:53:23.840 --> 01:53:27.920]   Unsafe downloads.
[01:53:27.920 --> 01:53:31.920]   They're also blocking mixed content resources like files, images, and scripts that get loaded
[01:53:31.920 --> 01:53:37.480]   over insecure connections from a web page that says it's HTTPS.
[01:53:37.480 --> 01:53:39.880]   So you see this warning a lot, right?
[01:53:39.880 --> 01:53:40.880]   Mixed content.
[01:53:40.880 --> 01:53:42.960]   It's just confusing to users.
[01:53:42.960 --> 01:53:44.720]   Is this secure or am I not secure?
[01:53:44.720 --> 01:53:46.200]   Is this file secure?
[01:53:46.200 --> 01:53:51.720]   So it'll protect your privacy and also protect your--
[01:53:51.720 --> 01:53:55.640]   You can still get a piece of math to do it overall.
[01:53:55.640 --> 01:53:56.960]   Oh yeah, it's not going to prevent malware.
[01:53:56.960 --> 01:53:57.960]   You know, if that's--
[01:53:57.960 --> 01:53:58.960]   Or did I say that?
[01:53:58.960 --> 01:53:59.960]   No, you didn't.
[01:53:59.960 --> 01:54:00.960]   But that's just--
[01:54:00.960 --> 01:54:04.160]   People will assume that they won't get malware.
[01:54:04.160 --> 01:54:07.800]   Insecure downloads are bad for privacy and security.
[01:54:07.800 --> 01:54:10.000]   An eavesdropper can see what a user's downloading.
[01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:13.400]   An active attacker can swap the download from malicious one.
[01:54:13.400 --> 01:54:15.040]   The man in the middle attack.
[01:54:15.040 --> 01:54:16.840]   That's prevented by HTTPS.
[01:54:16.840 --> 01:54:21.000]   So that's the theory there.
[01:54:21.000 --> 01:54:26.000]   And I'm going to have to read this carefully.
[01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:30.920]   Now you, period, can text like this, thanks, period, to Google's new speech to text, period.
[01:54:30.920 --> 01:54:31.920]   Settings.
[01:54:31.920 --> 01:54:32.920]   Google's--
[01:54:32.920 --> 01:54:36.720]   This is from the Verge, Kim Lyons writing, "Google's overly aggressive voice to text
[01:54:36.720 --> 01:54:39.400]   setting is auto punctuating poorly."
[01:54:39.400 --> 01:54:41.120]   That's not really a change log.
[01:54:41.120 --> 01:54:43.400]   That's a change complaint.
[01:54:43.400 --> 01:54:49.200]   Apparently, the change log is that they pushed a fix out over the last weekend.
[01:54:49.200 --> 01:54:54.640]   So if you're getting weird punctuation, it's not in Gboard.
[01:54:54.640 --> 01:54:58.440]   It's the voice typing mode, which doesn't have a keyboard attached to it.
[01:54:58.440 --> 01:55:01.040]   Google says we're going to fix that.
[01:55:01.040 --> 01:55:02.440]   Thanks, Google.
[01:55:02.440 --> 01:55:03.440]   Thanks, Google.
[01:55:03.440 --> 01:55:04.440]   You're swell.
[01:55:04.440 --> 01:55:06.520]   See, that's the way to be.
[01:55:06.520 --> 01:55:07.520]   Thanks, Google.
[01:55:07.520 --> 01:55:08.840]   Thank you, Google.
[01:55:08.840 --> 01:55:11.840]   I tell Google, thank you when it does things, right?
[01:55:11.840 --> 01:55:13.280]   You should.
[01:55:13.280 --> 01:55:16.280]   Are you ready for tidy QA?
[01:55:16.280 --> 01:55:17.280]   You're going to have to explain this.
[01:55:17.280 --> 01:55:19.080]   You're the queen of the data set.
[01:55:19.080 --> 01:55:22.400]   Oh, Lord, I don't even-- I was like, I've never even seen this.
[01:55:22.400 --> 01:55:23.400]   Hold up.
[01:55:23.400 --> 01:55:28.080]   It's a data set that aims to capture the uniqueness of languages.
[01:55:28.080 --> 01:55:34.880]   It's a question answering data set covering 11 languages inspired by typological diversity.
[01:55:34.880 --> 01:55:35.880]   Sorry.
[01:55:35.880 --> 01:55:36.880]   Yes.
[01:55:36.880 --> 01:55:41.120]   The theory is that different languages express meaning in structurally unique ways.
[01:55:41.120 --> 01:55:46.840]   Is it like the difference between when I'm speaking versus something like ASL where the
[01:55:46.840 --> 01:55:51.040]   subject verb, the whole structure of the language is different?
[01:55:51.040 --> 01:55:53.840]   I assume other languages have things like that.
[01:55:53.840 --> 01:55:59.000]   Well, there's always-- and Jeff knows this from his German.
[01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:00.000]   German.
[01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:02.120]   There's the subject object versus object subject.
[01:56:02.120 --> 01:56:04.880]   There's actually three different ways.
[01:56:04.880 --> 01:56:07.840]   English does it-- what is it?
[01:56:07.840 --> 01:56:10.440]   Subject, verb.
[01:56:10.440 --> 01:56:11.440]   Stacey runs fast.
[01:56:11.440 --> 01:56:13.080]   Stacey runs fast.
[01:56:13.080 --> 01:56:15.400]   Stacey steals the--
[01:56:15.400 --> 01:56:20.160]   Now it goes subject, verb, adjective.
[01:56:20.160 --> 01:56:21.160]   Adjective or--
[01:56:21.160 --> 01:56:23.400]   And German puts the verb at the end, right?
[01:56:23.400 --> 01:56:24.400]   So--
[01:56:24.400 --> 01:56:25.400]   Right.
[01:56:25.400 --> 01:56:28.720]   So Stacey hill runs.
[01:56:28.720 --> 01:56:30.120]   Subject object verb.
[01:56:30.120 --> 01:56:31.120]   That's it.
[01:56:31.120 --> 01:56:32.120]   So we--
[01:56:32.120 --> 01:56:33.120]   We have the hill runs.
[01:56:33.120 --> 01:56:34.120]   Oh, it's the other way around.
[01:56:34.120 --> 01:56:35.120]   So the first--
[01:56:35.120 --> 01:56:36.120]   In English, it's S--
[01:56:36.120 --> 01:56:37.120]   Subs it verb, verb, verb.
[01:56:37.120 --> 01:56:38.120]   Oh.
[01:56:38.120 --> 01:56:39.120]   Right.
[01:56:39.120 --> 01:56:40.120]   German is--
[01:56:40.120 --> 01:56:41.120]   S-O-V.
[01:56:41.120 --> 01:56:47.240]   There are languages that are V-O-S and V-S-O as well.
[01:56:47.240 --> 01:56:51.760]   So that's one structural issue.
[01:56:51.760 --> 01:56:53.600]   And there's more apparently.
[01:56:53.600 --> 01:56:57.080]   The researchers point out, for instance, that English changes words to indicate one
[01:56:57.080 --> 01:56:58.680]   book versus many books.
[01:56:58.680 --> 01:57:03.960]   Arabic has a third form to indicate if there are two of something.
[01:57:03.960 --> 01:57:06.800]   So you've got singular plural and just two.
[01:57:06.800 --> 01:57:10.080]   And there's gender issues as well.
[01:57:10.080 --> 01:57:11.920]   Chinese has no genders.
[01:57:11.920 --> 01:57:13.120]   China has no gender.
[01:57:13.120 --> 01:57:14.920]   German has three genders.
[01:57:14.920 --> 01:57:15.920]   What's the one?
[01:57:15.920 --> 01:57:16.920]   Oh, Newton.
[01:57:16.920 --> 01:57:17.920]   Just like Latin.
[01:57:17.920 --> 01:57:18.920]   Nuter.
[01:57:18.920 --> 01:57:19.920]   Male, female, neuter.
[01:57:19.920 --> 01:57:20.920]   Anyway, interesting.
[01:57:20.920 --> 01:57:21.920]   So there you go.
[01:57:21.920 --> 01:57:25.320]   I don't know what you do with it, but there you have it.
[01:57:25.320 --> 01:57:27.960]   And that, my friends, concludes a bizarre--
[01:57:27.960 --> 01:57:29.760]   You missed one.
[01:57:29.760 --> 01:57:30.760]   I missed one?
[01:57:30.760 --> 01:57:32.240]   You missed an Androidify.
[01:57:32.240 --> 01:57:34.720]   Androidify is gone.
[01:57:34.720 --> 01:57:38.040]   I hope you enjoyed it for the brief time it was there.
[01:57:38.040 --> 01:57:39.040]   What was that?
[01:57:39.040 --> 01:57:40.040]   This was the thing that--
[01:57:40.040 --> 01:57:41.040]   Oh, remember a lot.
[01:57:41.040 --> 01:57:45.640]   You could make a good emoji of yourself, but you'd be a little Android avatar.
[01:57:45.640 --> 01:57:47.120]   That was ridiculous.
[01:57:47.120 --> 01:57:48.960]   That was-- nobody used that.
[01:57:48.960 --> 01:57:50.960]   Jason Howell, a little holiday.
[01:57:50.960 --> 01:57:51.960]   It's a thing, dude.
[01:57:51.960 --> 01:57:52.960]   Android team used it.
[01:57:52.960 --> 01:57:53.960]   All of the readers and rumors did that.
[01:57:53.960 --> 01:57:54.960]   Rooters and rumors did it?
[01:57:54.960 --> 01:57:56.960]   Oh, yeah, because they would want a special, yeah.
[01:57:56.960 --> 01:57:57.960]   Yeah.
[01:57:57.960 --> 01:57:58.960]   Yeah.
[01:57:58.960 --> 01:58:00.520]   So no more Androidify.
[01:58:00.520 --> 01:58:08.040]   It hadn't been updated since 2016, so probably the guy left, and that's that.
[01:58:08.040 --> 01:58:11.040]   It might have been a girl.
[01:58:11.040 --> 01:58:12.520]   The person.
[01:58:12.520 --> 01:58:13.520]   There is still--
[01:58:13.520 --> 01:58:14.520]   The geek's gone.
[01:58:14.520 --> 01:58:15.520]   Might have been neuter.
[01:58:15.520 --> 01:58:16.760]   I take it back.
[01:58:16.760 --> 01:58:21.240]   I was going to go to androidify.com, but it redirects to android.com.
[01:58:21.240 --> 01:58:23.160]   So there isn't even a website anymore.
[01:58:23.160 --> 01:58:25.360]   It's gone.
[01:58:25.360 --> 01:58:28.520]   By Androidify, we hardly knew ye.
[01:58:28.520 --> 01:58:31.800]   We certainly rarely used ye.
[01:58:31.800 --> 01:58:34.760]   You know, the fun is gone.
[01:58:34.760 --> 01:58:35.760]   It is.
[01:58:35.760 --> 01:58:37.480]   It's business now, baby.
[01:58:37.480 --> 01:58:39.480]   You know, new phone, big deal.
[01:58:39.480 --> 01:58:41.280]   No, I like that phone.
[01:58:41.280 --> 01:58:43.120]   I can't make a little Android thing yourself.
[01:58:43.120 --> 01:58:44.120]   I like that phone.
[01:58:44.120 --> 01:58:45.120]   I want that phone.
[01:58:45.120 --> 01:58:46.560]   The fun is not gone.
[01:58:46.560 --> 01:58:50.840]   But Jeff, just today I talked to somebody about a new chip or Bluetooth and wireless.
[01:58:50.840 --> 01:58:53.400]   It's going to be a life so much better.
[01:58:53.400 --> 01:58:55.400]   You just have to be excited.
[01:58:55.400 --> 01:58:56.400]   You have the weirdest--
[01:58:56.400 --> 01:58:57.400]   I love when she starts talking.
[01:58:57.400 --> 01:58:58.400]   --to talk about chips.
[01:58:58.400 --> 01:59:00.400]   Of anybody I know.
[01:59:00.400 --> 01:59:04.880]   It's so awesome when you think about how these things are going to be used.
[01:59:04.880 --> 01:59:06.880]   Stacy, is that your thing of the week?
[01:59:06.880 --> 01:59:10.440]   No, my thing of the week is actually somebody-- oh, is it time for that?
[01:59:10.440 --> 01:59:11.440]   Yeah.
[01:59:11.440 --> 01:59:12.440]   All right.
[01:59:12.440 --> 01:59:13.440]   My thing of the week is--
[01:59:13.440 --> 01:59:14.440]   We got a close team.
[01:59:14.440 --> 01:59:16.240]   Oh, and that's the Google change log.
[01:59:16.240 --> 01:59:17.240]   I just love that.
[01:59:17.240 --> 01:59:20.240]   We got scruts around this show.
[01:59:20.240 --> 01:59:21.240]   Yeah.
[01:59:21.240 --> 01:59:22.800]   We're just like, right.
[01:59:22.800 --> 01:59:24.560]   You can't do that.
[01:59:24.560 --> 01:59:25.560]   You can't go all over.
[01:59:25.560 --> 01:59:28.280]   By the way, I left out one very important thing.
[01:59:28.280 --> 01:59:32.000]   You can send a birthday card to Google Maps.
[01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:35.160]   It's turning 15 as of February 6th.
[01:59:35.160 --> 01:59:38.960]   I hate that they changed the logo because now I can never find maps on my phone.
[01:59:38.960 --> 01:59:39.960]   It's kind of--
[01:59:39.960 --> 01:59:40.960]   Yeah, now it's just the pin.
[01:59:40.960 --> 01:59:41.960]   Yeah, I agree.
[01:59:41.960 --> 01:59:44.480]   You got to not change your little app icon.
[01:59:44.480 --> 01:59:45.480]   I know.
[01:59:45.480 --> 01:59:46.480]   So you didn't--
[01:59:46.480 --> 01:59:47.800]   I was like, where people changed their Twitter avatars.
[01:59:47.800 --> 01:59:48.800]   It looked like a map.
[01:59:48.800 --> 01:59:50.600]   It was too skewomorphic now it's a pin.
[01:59:50.600 --> 01:59:52.920]   The whole logo was kind of crappy.
[01:59:52.920 --> 01:59:56.800]   It's true, but I trained myself to find it.
[01:59:56.800 --> 02:00:00.680]   All right, Stacy, give us your pick of the week.
[02:00:00.680 --> 02:00:05.240]   My pick of the week because I think two people ask me on Twitter, which, you know, that's
[02:00:05.240 --> 02:00:06.240]   enough.
[02:00:06.240 --> 02:00:14.000]   I'll give you my opinion about books for tweens or teens or kids and teenage girls in particular.
[02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:16.680]   I am going to tell you for Valentine's Day.
[02:00:16.680 --> 02:00:21.720]   I purchased two books for my daughter, one of which is probably relevant to this audience.
[02:00:21.720 --> 02:00:24.560]   It's called Tweet Cute.
[02:00:24.560 --> 02:00:34.280]   It's about a girl whose family runs a burger chain and she runs their social media account
[02:00:34.280 --> 02:00:40.360]   and then a boy whose family runs a bistro and he has their social media account and the
[02:00:40.360 --> 02:00:41.360]   big chain.
[02:00:41.360 --> 02:00:46.760]   So give each other really bad reviews on the internet and get into a fight and get arrested,
[02:00:46.760 --> 02:00:47.760]   right?
[02:00:47.760 --> 02:00:51.280]   It's like, you know, it's like you've got mail except instead of email, it's Twitter.
[02:00:51.280 --> 02:00:55.080]   I was going to ask if this was like influencer coaching at a younger age.
[02:00:55.080 --> 02:00:56.080]   Is that what this is?
[02:00:56.080 --> 02:00:57.080]   What is this?
[02:00:57.080 --> 02:00:59.920]   The FPC arrests them both for not revealing their--
[02:00:59.920 --> 02:01:00.920]   No, sir.
[02:01:00.920 --> 02:01:05.760]   So it's basically like a cute little rom-com set in like this age.
[02:01:05.760 --> 02:01:06.760]   So that's one.
[02:01:06.760 --> 02:01:09.720]   And then the other one is sway.
[02:01:09.720 --> 02:01:10.720]   Is it?
[02:01:10.720 --> 02:01:11.720]   Slay.
[02:01:11.720 --> 02:01:12.720]   I didn't put that in.
[02:01:12.720 --> 02:01:13.720]   Let me get it.
[02:01:13.720 --> 02:01:14.720]   Sorry.
[02:01:14.720 --> 02:01:16.920]   It's not in the doc.
[02:01:16.920 --> 02:01:18.320]   Slay, Amazon.
[02:01:18.320 --> 02:01:19.320]   I'm sorry, you guys.
[02:01:19.320 --> 02:01:22.040]   And I'm trying to get the author by Brittany Morris.
[02:01:22.040 --> 02:01:23.440]   And it's about a girl.
[02:01:23.440 --> 02:01:26.360]   She's like 12 or 13, I think.
[02:01:26.360 --> 02:01:34.240]   And she designs an online world that celebrates African-American heritage.
[02:01:34.240 --> 02:01:38.960]   And then it gets hacked and people are turning it into this horrible, horrible place.
[02:01:38.960 --> 02:01:42.040]   She's got to solve this because she doesn't want to shut it down because she wants a place
[02:01:42.040 --> 02:01:44.680]   for people to feel like they're themselves.
[02:01:44.680 --> 02:01:46.840]   And this is exciting.
[02:01:46.840 --> 02:01:49.080]   And so those are the two books.
[02:01:49.080 --> 02:01:52.760]   My daughter went to a bookstore and found that there were a gajillion books that she
[02:01:52.760 --> 02:01:53.760]   wanted to read.
[02:01:53.760 --> 02:01:58.400]   So those are the two I purchased for her that have her seal of approval.
[02:01:58.400 --> 02:02:01.480]   So if you're in the market, there you go.
[02:02:01.480 --> 02:02:02.480]   I love that.
[02:02:02.480 --> 02:02:07.400]   I used to go with Abby to the bookstore and we'd go home with an arm full of books.
[02:02:07.400 --> 02:02:09.920]   And like your daughter, she read way too fast.
[02:02:09.920 --> 02:02:12.320]   And we get through them and I'll do that week.
[02:02:12.320 --> 02:02:16.600]   Yeah, my friends just gave her the soul of an octopus, which is kind of a, it's not a
[02:02:16.600 --> 02:02:22.200]   dense book, but I wouldn't expect a 13 year old to like down that and like sitting, but
[02:02:22.200 --> 02:02:23.200]   she did.
[02:02:23.200 --> 02:02:25.320]   I think that's so cool.
[02:02:25.320 --> 02:02:29.600]   I think that bodes well for your, both you as a parent and hers.
[02:02:29.600 --> 02:02:30.600]   That's awesome.
[02:02:30.600 --> 02:02:32.520]   And you got a pick for us?
[02:02:32.520 --> 02:02:34.320]   I do.
[02:02:34.320 --> 02:02:36.440]   So I've been with the Black History Month theme.
[02:02:36.440 --> 02:02:43.600]   I want to give a shout out to the Willie T. Ribs documentary, which was produced by Adam
[02:02:43.600 --> 02:02:44.600]   Corolla.
[02:02:44.600 --> 02:02:47.000]   It is now available on Netflix, just in case people.
[02:02:47.000 --> 02:02:49.000]   He produced a lot of documentaries.
[02:02:49.000 --> 02:02:51.240]   He's really big into documentaries.
[02:02:51.240 --> 02:02:53.120]   And this one is so well.
[02:02:53.120 --> 02:02:54.480]   But they're all about cars.
[02:02:54.480 --> 02:02:56.440]   No, not always.
[02:02:56.440 --> 02:02:58.480]   I was hoping it was for home delivered ribs.
[02:02:58.480 --> 02:03:01.120]   No, that's a guy's name.
[02:03:01.120 --> 02:03:02.120]   Willie T. Ribs.
[02:03:02.120 --> 02:03:04.240]   He's the Jackie Robinson of auto racing.
[02:03:04.240 --> 02:03:05.240]   Right.
[02:03:05.240 --> 02:03:07.160]   And the doc is called Uppity.
[02:03:07.160 --> 02:03:13.400]   He's the first African American to qualify for the ND 500.
[02:03:13.400 --> 02:03:18.840]   And coming from the South, I grew up with my granddad being a mechanic for Chevrolet
[02:03:18.840 --> 02:03:21.760]   for pretty much all of my adult life, all of my life.
[02:03:21.760 --> 02:03:26.080]   And so we would talk about racing every now and then, but we never got into the story
[02:03:26.080 --> 02:03:27.080]   of Willie T. Ribs.
[02:03:27.080 --> 02:03:29.040]   I knew nothing about this.
[02:03:29.040 --> 02:03:30.040]   Nobody does.
[02:03:30.040 --> 02:03:31.440]   That's the sad story, right?
[02:03:31.440 --> 02:03:36.360]   I knew nothing about it, but going into this documentary, I was able to learn more about
[02:03:36.360 --> 02:03:41.360]   the battles that he had just gone from the US to international racing and coming back
[02:03:41.360 --> 02:03:42.800]   to the US to race.
[02:03:42.800 --> 02:03:44.480]   He was kind of accepted in England.
[02:03:44.480 --> 02:03:45.480]   Kinda.
[02:03:45.480 --> 02:03:46.480]   Yeah.
[02:03:46.480 --> 02:03:47.480]   Right.
[02:03:47.480 --> 02:03:48.480]   He was a Formula 4 champion.
[02:03:48.480 --> 02:03:51.960]   But then here in the US and getting in the NASCAR, there were points where even his own
[02:03:51.960 --> 02:03:53.680]   teammates were trying to sabotage.
[02:03:53.680 --> 02:03:54.680]   That's so sad.
[02:03:54.680 --> 02:03:56.600]   But he was still able to overcome.
[02:03:56.600 --> 02:03:59.760]   What year was there about looks like 70s maybe?
[02:03:59.760 --> 02:04:01.960]   Nah, I thought it was up to the 80s.
[02:04:01.960 --> 02:04:02.960]   Really that recently.
[02:04:02.960 --> 02:04:05.000]   I want to say again today.
[02:04:05.000 --> 02:04:09.840]   He was the first African American to race in the Indy 500.
[02:04:09.840 --> 02:04:12.680]   Just a great story and it was just really raw.
[02:04:12.680 --> 02:04:15.520]   There's no narration in it except for him.
[02:04:15.520 --> 02:04:17.960]   So it's really, really good.
[02:04:17.960 --> 02:04:18.960]   Well done.
[02:04:18.960 --> 02:04:19.960]   Really good.
[02:04:19.960 --> 02:04:20.960]   Well done.
[02:04:20.960 --> 02:04:22.520]   That's a good one.
[02:04:22.520 --> 02:04:24.920]   Jeffy Jarvis.
[02:04:24.920 --> 02:04:31.520]   So I kind of like this one so Google has six need states for search.
[02:04:31.520 --> 02:04:34.880]   This may panic you because they want to get into your head more than you would think.
[02:04:34.880 --> 02:04:37.080]   These six states are surprise me.
[02:04:37.080 --> 02:04:38.080]   Yeah.
[02:04:38.080 --> 02:04:39.080]   Help me.
[02:04:39.080 --> 02:04:40.080]   Help me.
[02:04:40.080 --> 02:04:41.080]   Reassure me.
[02:04:41.080 --> 02:04:42.280]   Educate me.
[02:04:42.280 --> 02:04:43.920]   Impress me.
[02:04:43.920 --> 02:04:44.920]   And thrill me.
[02:04:44.920 --> 02:04:47.920]   Can you do this in the I'm feeling lucky box?
[02:04:47.920 --> 02:04:49.920]   This is no, this is how they're doing the product.
[02:04:49.920 --> 02:04:52.080]   This is their personas.
[02:04:52.080 --> 02:04:53.760]   So what gets me is so that there's three kinds.
[02:04:53.760 --> 02:04:56.240]   There's emotional needs, social needs and functional needs.
[02:04:56.240 --> 02:04:59.880]   You would think that Google would only be about functional needs and wouldn't be in
[02:04:59.880 --> 02:05:00.880]   your head.
[02:05:00.880 --> 02:05:04.520]   How would they know if you want to be surprised or helped?
[02:05:04.520 --> 02:05:07.480]   Well, this is what every company does when they do these personas.
[02:05:07.480 --> 02:05:08.480]   Yeah.
[02:05:08.480 --> 02:05:10.880]   So he is a 25 year old.
[02:05:10.880 --> 02:05:11.880]   Yeah.
[02:05:11.880 --> 02:05:12.880]   Go ahead.
[02:05:12.880 --> 02:05:14.680]   No, it's targeted towards advertisers.
[02:05:14.680 --> 02:05:15.840]   It's not for you and I.
[02:05:15.840 --> 02:05:20.520]   It's like, do you want to be next to a search that for a user who's looking for something
[02:05:20.520 --> 02:05:21.520]   surprising?
[02:05:21.520 --> 02:05:22.520]   Right.
[02:05:22.520 --> 02:05:26.120]   High dollar, cool, whatever.
[02:05:26.120 --> 02:05:27.120]   Maybe you want to be there.
[02:05:27.120 --> 02:05:29.240]   If you're reassuring, you're going to be like pampers.
[02:05:29.240 --> 02:05:33.680]   Oh, see, I thought, so when you go to the Google search page and you hover your mouse
[02:05:33.680 --> 02:05:36.080]   over, I'm feeling lucky.
[02:05:36.080 --> 02:05:38.640]   It will do different, you know, that I could choose.
[02:05:38.640 --> 02:05:40.280]   Oh, I didn't even know that.
[02:05:40.280 --> 02:05:42.400]   Yeah, I'm feeling puzzled.
[02:05:42.400 --> 02:05:44.400]   You didn't know I'm feeling doodly.
[02:05:44.400 --> 02:05:45.400]   I do not know that.
[02:05:45.400 --> 02:05:46.400]   I didn't know that.
[02:05:46.400 --> 02:05:47.400]   I didn't know that.
[02:05:47.400 --> 02:05:51.400]   And it's kind of like the magic eight ball because you don't control what it's going
[02:05:51.400 --> 02:05:52.400]   to say.
[02:05:52.400 --> 02:05:54.600]   You just have to each time try again.
[02:05:54.600 --> 02:05:55.600]   I've always just done.
[02:05:55.600 --> 02:05:58.000]   I'm feeling lucky and clicked it and moved on.
[02:05:58.000 --> 02:06:04.080]   Mine does never get hungry and I'm going to get restaurants, right?
[02:06:04.080 --> 02:06:05.920]   I'm feeling playful.
[02:06:05.920 --> 02:06:06.920]   What am I going to get?
[02:06:06.920 --> 02:06:09.720]   I'm going to get playful stuff.
[02:06:09.720 --> 02:06:11.000]   There's oh, it's art cloaking.
[02:06:11.000 --> 02:06:14.000]   No, this is from 2011.
[02:06:14.000 --> 02:06:16.080]   Nine years ago was art cloaking his 90th birthday.
[02:06:16.080 --> 02:06:19.040]   He's the guy created a gumpy.
[02:06:19.040 --> 02:06:21.000]   I guess his doodles.
[02:06:21.000 --> 02:06:22.000]   This is random doodles.
[02:06:22.000 --> 02:06:23.000]   I don't know.
[02:06:23.000 --> 02:06:24.000]   I'm feeling stellar.
[02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:25.280]   Ooh, what are we going to get?
[02:06:25.280 --> 02:06:31.720]   The world's oh, it's Google misusing its monopoly to advertise its own service.
[02:06:31.720 --> 02:06:38.800]   Well, yeah, your opinions go after them.
[02:06:38.800 --> 02:06:41.920]   Well, now I want to own the earth.
[02:06:41.920 --> 02:06:44.720]   Now I'm stuck in Google Earth.
[02:06:44.720 --> 02:06:46.520]   The world's most good.
[02:06:46.520 --> 02:06:47.520]   Well done.
[02:06:47.520 --> 02:06:48.520]   Detail globe.
[02:06:48.520 --> 02:06:50.200]   Anyway, I thought it was that.
[02:06:50.200 --> 02:06:51.200]   It's not.
[02:06:51.200 --> 02:06:53.000]   It's something else that's going on behind the scenes.
[02:06:53.000 --> 02:06:54.000]   Yeah.
[02:06:54.000 --> 02:07:02.720]   Meanwhile, Jeff Bezos bought David Gefan's mansion for a 1.65 million dollars.
[02:07:02.720 --> 02:07:03.720]   165 million dollars.
[02:07:03.720 --> 02:07:07.560]   Oh, by the way, no truth to the rumor that Bill Gates is buying a yacht.
[02:07:07.560 --> 02:07:08.920]   Yeah, that was ridiculous.
[02:07:08.920 --> 02:07:09.920]   You just knew it.
[02:07:09.920 --> 02:07:12.560]   That was just bad journalism, wasn't it?
[02:07:12.560 --> 02:07:14.360]   Yes, you caught an journalism.
[02:07:14.360 --> 02:07:16.760]   Well, it was repeated everywhere.
[02:07:16.760 --> 02:07:18.560]   There's the 165 million.
[02:07:18.560 --> 02:07:25.800]   But see, now after this, I feel like I can't do any of these stories.
[02:07:25.800 --> 02:07:28.320]   This was out of Engadget.
[02:07:28.320 --> 02:07:32.760]   Bill Gates, reportedly buying the first hydrogen-powered super yacht.
[02:07:32.760 --> 02:07:33.920]   I just knew this was being--
[02:07:33.920 --> 02:07:36.080]   And then update.
[02:07:36.080 --> 02:07:42.000]   We got this from some site called Sinot, and apparently that's not true.
[02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:47.800]   But only one of the many journalists who retweeted this or repeated this bothered to call the
[02:07:47.800 --> 02:07:48.800]   manufacturer.
[02:07:48.800 --> 02:07:49.920]   I think it's a good story.
[02:07:49.920 --> 02:07:51.520]   That's the problem people want.
[02:07:51.520 --> 02:07:53.240]   They want to believe it.
[02:07:53.240 --> 02:07:54.240]   Right?
[02:07:54.240 --> 02:07:55.240]   Yeah.
[02:07:55.240 --> 02:07:57.320]   Sure, if he bought a yacht, okay, great.
[02:07:57.320 --> 02:07:58.880]   Yeah, it's expensive.
[02:07:58.880 --> 02:07:59.880]   He's got money.
[02:07:59.880 --> 02:08:00.880]   He's got a lot of money.
[02:08:00.880 --> 02:08:01.880]   Why didn't he buy a yacht?
[02:08:01.880 --> 02:08:02.880]   It's my question.
[02:08:02.880 --> 02:08:03.880]   Right.
[02:08:03.880 --> 02:08:10.480]   Apparently, he did not buy this $645 million, 100% green luxury super yacht.
[02:08:10.480 --> 02:08:11.720]   Not sold.
[02:08:11.720 --> 02:08:13.720]   I was hoping I'd get invited on it.
[02:08:13.720 --> 02:08:14.720]   I know.
[02:08:14.720 --> 02:08:15.720]   Oh, that's--
[02:08:15.720 --> 02:08:16.720]   Isn't that funny?
[02:08:16.720 --> 02:08:18.080]   There's no reason why they invite me.
[02:08:18.080 --> 02:08:21.080]   But I still have that fantasy.
[02:08:21.080 --> 02:08:23.120]   Maybe Bill would just say, hey, I like your podcast.
[02:08:23.120 --> 02:08:24.720]   You want to come on my yacht?
[02:08:24.720 --> 02:08:29.920]   It would be a story if that had said Newsom bought a yacht.
[02:08:29.920 --> 02:08:30.920]   But this is--
[02:08:30.920 --> 02:08:31.920]   Yeah, the governor.
[02:08:31.920 --> 02:08:32.920]   Yeah, no.
[02:08:32.920 --> 02:08:33.920]   Who cares what Bill Gates does?
[02:08:33.920 --> 02:08:34.920]   Anyway, he did--
[02:08:34.920 --> 02:08:37.080]   I thought it was cool that you could have a hydrogen-powered yacht.
[02:08:37.080 --> 02:08:38.080]   That's all I thought was cool.
[02:08:38.080 --> 02:08:39.080]   Yeah, that's a story.
[02:08:39.080 --> 02:08:40.080]   Is it--
[02:08:40.080 --> 02:08:41.560]   I was like, I thought the story was--
[02:08:41.560 --> 02:08:42.560]   Well, that's still true.
[02:08:42.560 --> 02:08:43.640]   It's still Bill Gates.
[02:08:43.640 --> 02:08:44.640]   That's still true.
[02:08:44.640 --> 02:08:45.640]   That is not untrue.
[02:08:45.640 --> 02:08:49.720]   That yacht is-- but what sign-on who was making it wanted everybody to know is we haven't sold
[02:08:49.720 --> 02:08:52.800]   it yet, so it's still available.
[02:08:52.800 --> 02:08:54.400]   Bill did not buy Aqua.
[02:08:54.400 --> 02:08:55.400]   Sure.
[02:08:55.400 --> 02:08:56.400]   It has a--
[02:08:56.400 --> 02:08:57.400]   It sure big.
[02:08:57.400 --> 02:09:00.280]   It has something like a 3,000 mile range.
[02:09:00.280 --> 02:09:03.240]   Because you can't guarantee there's hydrogen everywhere.
[02:09:03.240 --> 02:09:04.240]   Right.
[02:09:04.240 --> 02:09:05.240]   That's kind of cool.
[02:09:05.240 --> 02:09:08.880]   Can it make it from the water at Sailingon?
[02:09:08.880 --> 02:09:09.880]   Can it make for an additional--
[02:09:09.880 --> 02:09:10.880]   No.
[02:09:10.880 --> 02:09:11.880]   No.
[02:09:11.880 --> 02:09:15.600]   But the output is only the water--
[02:09:15.600 --> 02:09:16.600]   From the thing.
[02:09:16.600 --> 02:09:17.600]   Look at that.
[02:09:17.600 --> 02:09:18.600]   Right.
[02:09:18.600 --> 02:09:19.600]   No, I get that.
[02:09:19.600 --> 02:09:20.600]   I'm just like--
[02:09:20.600 --> 02:09:21.600]   Oh, that's not the yacht he bought.
[02:09:21.600 --> 02:09:22.600]   That's a yacht he rented.
[02:09:22.600 --> 02:09:23.600]   A little circle?
[02:09:23.600 --> 02:09:24.600]   So he has rented yachts like this.
[02:09:24.600 --> 02:09:25.600]   He just doesn't botany.
[02:09:25.600 --> 02:09:26.600]   He needs a--
[02:09:26.600 --> 02:09:28.320]   Bill's actually very smart.
[02:09:28.320 --> 02:09:31.240]   You always better not buy when you're talking yachts.
[02:09:31.240 --> 02:09:32.240]   Yeah.
[02:09:32.240 --> 02:09:35.000]   Even if you're as rich as Bill Gates.
[02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:36.160]   I have nothing to add.
[02:09:36.160 --> 02:09:37.160]   I have no--
[02:09:37.160 --> 02:09:38.160]   Well, I know what you're going to have next week.
[02:09:38.160 --> 02:09:40.160]   What am I going to have next week?
[02:09:40.160 --> 02:09:41.160]   Cake.
[02:09:41.160 --> 02:09:42.360]   You're going to have a phone.
[02:09:42.360 --> 02:09:43.400]   I want to have a flip phone.
[02:09:43.400 --> 02:09:46.320]   I actually added a pick for you, Bill.
[02:09:46.320 --> 02:09:47.320]   Oh, God.
[02:09:47.320 --> 02:09:48.320]   Carsten's--
[02:09:48.320 --> 02:09:49.320]   You better do what Carsten says.
[02:09:49.320 --> 02:09:51.320]   Because he's even doing pick.
[02:09:51.320 --> 02:09:52.320]   Get a producer.
[02:09:52.320 --> 02:09:53.320]   All right.
[02:09:53.320 --> 02:09:54.320]   All right.
[02:09:54.320 --> 02:09:55.320]   Oh, that is adorable.
[02:09:55.320 --> 02:09:56.320]   I need to produce.
[02:09:56.320 --> 02:09:57.320]   Oh, yeah.
[02:09:57.320 --> 02:09:58.320]   Oh, yeah.
[02:09:58.320 --> 02:09:59.320]   Oh, yeah.
[02:09:59.320 --> 02:10:00.320]   I closed the run down.
[02:10:00.320 --> 02:10:02.320]   I got it on this screen.
[02:10:02.320 --> 02:10:03.320]   I could--
[02:10:03.320 --> 02:10:04.760]   OK, this is Carsten's pick.
[02:10:04.760 --> 02:10:07.440]   Someone with no distraction for your cell phone.
[02:10:07.440 --> 02:10:10.760]   Were they working old school rotary dial?
[02:10:10.760 --> 02:10:12.040]   Nice.
[02:10:12.040 --> 02:10:14.720]   No distractions on that.
[02:10:14.720 --> 02:10:15.720]   That antenna is awesome.
[02:10:15.720 --> 02:10:18.600]   Mike, get a hernia carrying it around.
[02:10:18.600 --> 02:10:22.200]   Is that part of a-- I'm trying to figure out on the side what--
[02:10:22.200 --> 02:10:23.880]   Is that your antenna meter?
[02:10:23.880 --> 02:10:26.760]   Like saying, this is how good your antenna signal strength is.
[02:10:26.760 --> 02:10:27.760]   Yeah.
[02:10:27.760 --> 02:10:29.760]   I'm sure that's probably what that is.
[02:10:29.760 --> 02:10:30.760]   Yeah.
[02:10:30.760 --> 02:10:32.240]   But it doesn't look like it has a signal.
[02:10:32.240 --> 02:10:33.240]   Can you buy it?
[02:10:33.240 --> 02:10:36.480]   OK, now I'm curious, because now I'm thinking maybe I should get this.
[02:10:36.480 --> 02:10:37.480]   No, he's going to buy it.
[02:10:37.480 --> 02:10:41.360]   This is from Gizmodo.
[02:10:41.360 --> 02:10:43.440]   But it was filed today.
[02:10:43.440 --> 02:10:45.640]   Oh, it's a new story.
[02:10:45.640 --> 02:10:46.640]   Look at that.
[02:10:46.640 --> 02:10:47.640]   That's a beauty.
[02:10:47.640 --> 02:10:50.280]   Oh, this is created by a woman?
[02:10:50.280 --> 02:10:51.280]   Yes.
[02:10:51.280 --> 02:10:52.280]   Justine helped.
[02:10:52.280 --> 02:10:54.280]   Oh, it's justine helped.
[02:10:54.280 --> 02:10:55.280]   Justine helped.
[02:10:55.280 --> 02:10:56.280]   Oh, it is.
[02:10:56.280 --> 02:10:57.280]   It's an LED signal meter.
[02:10:57.280 --> 02:10:58.280]   Yep.
[02:10:58.280 --> 02:10:59.280]   Nice.
[02:10:59.280 --> 02:11:04.000]   It's got a liquid ink screen.
[02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:09.240]   An eink screen that shows color information and history.
[02:11:09.240 --> 02:11:14.080]   So there is-- it's not technology light.
[02:11:14.080 --> 02:11:16.440]   It just doesn't have any distractions.
[02:11:16.440 --> 02:11:20.560]   You can't put it in a pocket unless Gizmodo says you're wearing an oversized novelty
[02:11:20.560 --> 02:11:23.160]   trench coat.
[02:11:23.160 --> 02:11:25.640]   But you could hold it up to your ear for the length of an average.
[02:11:25.640 --> 02:11:27.240]   Is that a photo in your pocket?
[02:11:27.240 --> 02:11:27.760]   Good boy.
[02:11:27.760 --> 02:11:28.720]   That's hysterical.
[02:11:28.720 --> 02:11:29.240]   Good fruit.
[02:11:29.240 --> 02:11:33.040]   Justine helped.
[02:11:33.040 --> 02:11:36.000]   She put this on her website.
[02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:40.800]   Because in a finicky, annoying touchscreen world of hyper-connected people using phones,
[02:11:40.800 --> 02:11:44.720]   they have no control over understanding of, I wanted something that would be entirely
[02:11:44.720 --> 02:11:51.880]   mine, personal, and absolutely tactile while giving me an excuse for not texting.
[02:11:51.880 --> 02:11:56.360]   The design page that's linked in there is hilarious.
[02:11:56.360 --> 02:11:57.440]   The design files?
[02:11:57.440 --> 02:11:58.440]   This one?
[02:11:58.440 --> 02:11:59.440]   Mm-hmm.
[02:11:59.440 --> 02:12:00.440]   Just the comments that she has on there.
[02:12:00.440 --> 02:12:01.440]   Oh, I didn't--
[02:12:01.440 --> 02:12:02.440]   Oh, I did.
[02:12:02.440 --> 02:12:03.440]   Oh, I did.
[02:12:03.440 --> 02:12:04.440]   404, 404, 404.
[02:12:04.440 --> 02:12:05.440]   Look at that.
[02:12:05.440 --> 02:12:07.760]   This is a good story.
[02:12:07.760 --> 02:12:08.760]   I like it.
[02:12:08.760 --> 02:12:09.760]   Justine-hauped.
[02:12:09.760 --> 02:12:10.760]   HAUP.
[02:12:10.760 --> 02:12:13.960]   We know what the case was.com.
[02:12:13.960 --> 02:12:16.160]   It's a 3D printed enclosure.
[02:12:16.160 --> 02:12:19.320]   Yeah, because originally it was on cardboard.
[02:12:19.320 --> 02:12:22.320]   It uses an Arduino micro as the controller.
[02:12:22.320 --> 02:12:24.760]   I don't know.
[02:12:24.760 --> 02:12:25.760]   I'll just--
[02:12:25.760 --> 02:12:30.640]   I mean, the hard part was making the dial work with touchtone.
[02:12:30.640 --> 02:12:32.360]   Yeah, but it's not that hard.
[02:12:32.360 --> 02:12:38.120]   It's not touchtone that the way a dial works is it has-- the rotary dial has switches and
[02:12:38.120 --> 02:12:39.120]   it clicks.
[02:12:39.120 --> 02:12:43.360]   I know, but that doesn't work on a cell phone.
[02:12:43.360 --> 02:12:44.360]   That's digital.
[02:12:44.360 --> 02:12:45.960]   That's analog to digital signaling.
[02:12:45.960 --> 02:12:46.960]   That's DSPs right there.
[02:12:46.960 --> 02:12:49.160]   There are a couple of class of chips that do that.
[02:12:49.160 --> 02:12:52.320]   I actually have-- gosh, I wonder where I put it.
[02:12:52.320 --> 02:12:53.520]   Yeah, you can do that with an Arduino.
[02:12:53.520 --> 02:12:56.320]   I have it a Western electric dial cell phone.
[02:12:56.320 --> 02:12:57.320]   But it was so fun.
[02:12:57.320 --> 02:12:59.400]   You put a sim in it.
[02:12:59.400 --> 02:13:00.400]   I had it for the longest time.
[02:13:00.400 --> 02:13:01.400]   It was red, remember?
[02:13:01.400 --> 02:13:04.640]   I wonder where it happened to that.
[02:13:04.640 --> 02:13:05.640]   Probably over there.
[02:13:05.640 --> 02:13:08.440]   It's probably somewhere.
[02:13:08.440 --> 02:13:10.080]   I got it because Wozniak had it.
[02:13:10.080 --> 02:13:13.920]   In fact, I was on a cruise with Steve Wozniak.
[02:13:13.920 --> 02:13:15.080]   Hydrogen powered cruise?
[02:13:15.080 --> 02:13:18.040]   Hydrogen-- no, a regular everyday boat cruise.
[02:13:18.040 --> 02:13:21.480]   And he comes to the table for dinner and plops down.
[02:13:21.480 --> 02:13:23.160]   An old Western electric phone.
[02:13:23.160 --> 02:13:24.480]   He says, "Yes, my cell phone."
[02:13:24.480 --> 02:13:26.200]   He dials it up for beautiful.
[02:13:26.200 --> 02:13:27.200]   Ha!
[02:13:27.200 --> 02:13:28.200]   He's crazy.
[02:13:28.200 --> 02:13:29.600]   No one else would have it but him.
[02:13:29.600 --> 02:13:30.600]   No, I love him.
[02:13:30.600 --> 02:13:31.600]   I love him.
[02:13:31.600 --> 02:13:33.720]   Ladies and gentlemen, I think we can wrap this up.
[02:13:33.720 --> 02:13:35.800]   Thank you so much, Stacey Higginbotham.
[02:13:35.800 --> 02:13:38.320]   She is, of course, at Stacey on IOT.com.
[02:13:38.320 --> 02:13:39.240]   That's her website.

[02:13:41.320 --> 02:13:42.600]   What?
[02:13:42.600 --> 02:13:46.040]   I did my wave and then I was like, "Quack!"
[02:13:46.040 --> 02:13:47.520]   I pulled my headphones out.
[02:13:47.520 --> 02:13:49.880]   Oh, well, OK, bye.
[02:13:49.880 --> 02:13:51.440]   That's the thing I do.
[02:13:51.440 --> 02:13:53.240]   That's just me being grateful.
[02:13:53.240 --> 02:13:54.000]   OK, bye.
[02:13:54.000 --> 02:13:56.400]   And you can also listen to her podcast with Kevin Tofel.
[02:13:56.400 --> 02:13:58.880]   We'll be here next week.
[02:13:58.880 --> 02:14:00.200]   All about IOT.
[02:14:00.200 --> 02:14:02.520]   Thank you, Stacey.
[02:14:02.520 --> 02:14:06.320]   Thanks to Jeff Jarvis, Professor, esteemed--
[02:14:06.320 --> 02:14:07.640]   All right, I got to read it.
[02:14:07.640 --> 02:14:10.720]   --estined Leonard Taap, Professor for journalistic
[02:14:10.720 --> 02:14:13.280]   Innovation of the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism
[02:14:13.280 --> 02:14:14.840]   at the City University of New York.
[02:14:14.840 --> 02:14:16.360]   He joins us each week.
[02:14:16.360 --> 02:14:18.200]   He blogs at buzzmachine.com.
[02:14:18.200 --> 02:14:20.840]   He is @JeffJarvis on the Twitter.
[02:14:20.840 --> 02:14:23.440]   And we love him and his bookshelves.
[02:14:23.440 --> 02:14:24.680]   Thank you, Jeff.
[02:14:24.680 --> 02:14:26.840]   Jeff, I need you to do the Charlie Chaplin
[02:14:26.840 --> 02:14:28.720]   moving down the stairs gag.
[02:14:28.720 --> 02:14:32.040]   Yeah, I mean, it's your lower third.
[02:14:32.040 --> 02:14:34.760]   And @Pruitt, who's the host of Hands-On Photography,
[02:14:34.760 --> 02:14:36.920]   some other shows coming soon.
[02:14:36.920 --> 02:14:38.000]   Yes, yes, yes.
[02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:39.760]   Our staff photographer.
[02:14:39.760 --> 02:14:42.720]   And bless his heart.
[02:14:42.720 --> 02:14:44.440]   Bless my heart, as they say.
[02:14:44.440 --> 02:14:46.400]   Bless his heart.
[02:14:46.400 --> 02:14:46.920]   We love having--
[02:14:46.920 --> 02:14:47.840]   He blesses everybody else.
[02:14:47.840 --> 02:14:50.040]   --on the show every single Wednesday.
[02:14:50.040 --> 02:14:52.240]   Twit.tv/hop.
[02:14:52.240 --> 02:14:53.120]   Hop!
[02:14:53.120 --> 02:14:55.160]   Twit.tv/hop.
[02:14:55.160 --> 02:14:58.800]   Thanks also to Carson Bondi, our newest show host.
[02:14:58.800 --> 02:15:01.800]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:15:01.800 --> 02:15:03.360]   And Harvard graduate.
[02:15:03.360 --> 02:15:06.840]   You can find him behind the glowing screen--
[02:15:06.840 --> 02:15:07.840]   All tied up.
[02:15:07.840 --> 02:15:08.600]   --in his mom's--
[02:15:08.600 --> 02:15:10.480]   He's saying not behind the curtain.
[02:15:10.480 --> 02:15:12.080]   He's the man behind the curtain.
[02:15:12.080 --> 02:15:14.000]   Ladies and gentlemen, we do this week in Google
[02:15:14.000 --> 02:15:18.760]   every Wednesday, 130 Pacific, 430 Eastern, 2130 UTC.
[02:15:18.760 --> 02:15:21.000]   Watch live at Twit.tv/live.
[02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:23.040]   There's also an audio stream so you can listen live there.
[02:15:23.040 --> 02:15:25.000]   If you are doing the live thing,
[02:15:25.000 --> 02:15:27.120]   you should go into the chat room, because that's where everybody
[02:15:27.120 --> 02:15:29.560]   is, who's talking about the show in real time,
[02:15:29.560 --> 02:15:31.600]   at irc.twit.tv.
[02:15:31.600 --> 02:15:35.000]   You could talk about the show behind our backs asynchronously
[02:15:35.000 --> 02:15:38.040]   as it were on the forums, that's Twit.community.
[02:15:38.040 --> 02:15:40.120]   Or we even have a mastodon instance.
[02:15:40.120 --> 02:15:44.280]   It's a Twitter-like thing at Twit.social.
[02:15:44.280 --> 02:15:47.760]   So there's three ways you can talk back to us.
[02:15:47.760 --> 02:15:49.640]   We love hearing from you.
[02:15:49.640 --> 02:15:52.400]   If you can't be here in the live venue,
[02:15:52.400 --> 02:15:56.160]   then you can always go after the fact to twit.tv/twig.
[02:15:56.160 --> 02:15:58.480]   That's where we put the shows.
[02:15:58.480 --> 02:16:01.080]   You can download any show, audio, or video.
[02:16:01.080 --> 02:16:03.040]   Best thing to do, though, if you have a podcast client
[02:16:03.040 --> 02:16:07.440]   and we work everywhere, everywhere, including YouTube,
[02:16:07.440 --> 02:16:08.320]   just subscribe.
[02:16:08.320 --> 02:16:10.760]   That way you'll get it every time it's available.
[02:16:10.760 --> 02:16:14.280]   The minute it's available, bring it with you on Thursday
[02:16:14.280 --> 02:16:15.480]   Monday, OK?
[02:16:15.480 --> 02:16:16.160]   Thanks, everybody.
[02:16:16.160 --> 02:16:19.760]   We'll see you next time on This Week in Google.
[02:16:19.760 --> 02:16:21.400]   Bye-bye.
[02:16:21.400 --> 02:16:25.040]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:16:25.040 --> 02:16:26.240]   Welcome to Hands on iOS.
[02:16:26.240 --> 02:16:27.800]   This is the show where I'll teach you
[02:16:27.800 --> 02:16:30.480]   how to get the most out of your iPads, your Apple TVs,
[02:16:30.480 --> 02:16:32.160]   your Apple watches, your iPhones.
[02:16:32.160 --> 02:16:34.400]   If you got an iPod, I can help you with that, too.
[02:16:34.400 --> 02:16:35.720]   We're going to dig deep.
[02:16:35.720 --> 02:16:38.320]   We're going to go into settings and learn about all sorts
[02:16:38.320 --> 02:16:39.120]   of new tools.
[02:16:39.120 --> 02:16:42.040]   I'm going to show you the best apps there are, plus loads
[02:16:42.040 --> 02:16:43.080]   of tips and tricks.
[02:16:43.080 --> 02:16:45.280]   And maybe I'll even answer your question.
[02:16:45.280 --> 02:16:46.800]   There's so much to learn.
[02:16:46.800 --> 02:16:50.120]   And you can love your devices even more than you already do
[02:16:50.120 --> 02:16:51.840]   with Hands on iOS.
