[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.880]   [MUSIC PLAYING]

[00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:07.280]   From people you trust.
[00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.120]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.840]   This is Twit.

[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.240]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.480]   It's time for Twig this week in Google.
[00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.440]   Episode 60 recorded September 15, 2010.
[00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.120]   Pub/Sub/Hub/Bub/FUD.
[00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:50.120]   It's time for Twig this week in Google.
[00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.200]   We cover Google and the cloud.
[00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.600]   And here to do it with us, it's partly cloudy
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.440]   whatever Gina goes, but partly sunny, because of her smile.
[00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:05.120]   Gina Trapani from Cissalee and smartaware.org.
[00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.080]   And in the remainder bin, the complete kind of Google wave.
[00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.080]   Indeed.
[00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.080]   We see.
[00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.080]   Oh, wow.
[00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.360]   Well, no, wait a minute.
[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.760]   You're saved, because isn't it going open source?
[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.400]   And people are going to need documentation.
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:21.400]   I'm hoping so.
[00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.320]   And the future is bright for that Google wave.
[00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.120]   I'd be a wavebook in a box.
[00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.920]   We'll see.
[00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.040]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:28.240]   With wave.
[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.740]   Yeah.
[00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:29.520]   Yeah.
[00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.600]   Also here, ladies and gentlemen, Jeff Jarvis back home,
[00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.040]   finally, from his travels.
[00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.600]   There I am.
[00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:36.240]   Been all over the world.
[00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.200]   Oh, sweet.
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.400]   Author of What Would Google Do, this fine book
[00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.840]   available everywhere in bookstores.
[00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.520]   See, Jeff, if Google went out of business,
[00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.600]   this would be in the remainder bin, too, but fortunate.
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:48.120]   So would be a common--
[00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.240]   Jeff made a better bet than I did.
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.800]   You've been on the whole company, you see.
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:52.800]   Yeah.
[00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.240]   That's not always a good bet.
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.400]   But also with us today, we're glad to have him.
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.400]   Kevin Purdy is back.
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.280]   He is, of course, editor.
[00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.520]   Are you editor in chief of Lighthecker?
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:02.080]   No, no.
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.040]   That is that impash.
[00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:03.640]   Oh, that's right.
[00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:04.160]   I am.
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.520]   I'm a contributing editor over there.
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.360]   Contributing editor and the author of a brand new book.
[00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.760]   Did it come out today?
[00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:12.200]   An hour and a half ago, actually.
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.880]   This is so exciting.
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.720]   Yes, the complete Android guide.
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.760]   And you're doing the same thing Gina did,
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.440]   which is online sales.
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.920]   Yes, a freely browsable website.
[00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:31.480]   And beyond that, there's a DRM free PDF, ePub, and paper
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:32.600]   book if you want that, too.
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:33.360]   And there it is.
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.160]   $19.95 to buy the paperback, $9 for the e-book.
[00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.640]   And that's right.
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.560]   And it's the websites here at completeandroidguide.com.
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.400]   We're going to do an Android show, actually.
[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.360]   So I'm going to have to get this book and read it.
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.640]   Not about programming, Andrew, but apps and tips and so forth.
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:51.560]   Yeah.
[00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.280]   I'm pleased to say before the show,
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.600]   I was able to show Kevin yet another tip.
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.760]   I am sorry I was on the phone before.
[00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:59.960]   Which we'll get to you later.
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:00.560]   No.
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.920]   Is there somebody in the room with you?
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:03.560]   With me?
[00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.720]   With me?
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.760]   Yes, actually there is somebody in the room with me.
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:07.320]   I'm sorry.
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.680]   You're not alone.
[00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.720]   I'll address that in a moment, Kevin.
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.280]   Get out of the house.
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.480]   That phone call is coming from inside.
[00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.200]   I know.
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:17.840]   Sorry.
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:18.360]   Lost my head.
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.840]   Sorry I'll take care of it.
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.520]   They already legalized marijuana in California.
[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:23.760]   Any minute now, Jeff.
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:24.760]   You sound like it.
[00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:25.920]   Any minute now.
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.760]   Now we were talking about that earlier in the day because in November I guess it's on
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.920]   the ballot and I'd say it's about even money that it might pass.
[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.120]   There's a suggestion in Twitter for this week in weed.
[00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.120]   I'm serious.
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.080]   That's somebody was arguing that you ought to start this week in weed.
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.080]   This week in weed.
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.080]   Twoo.
[00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:44.080]   Yeah, we might.
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.080]   Amen.
[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.080]   Amen.
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.080]   You got to see them talk about?
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.080]   We're going to do this week in bongs.
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.080]   What up?
[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.080]   It'll be awesome.
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.040]   Like Bob Marley and some bongs would be great.
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.040]   Fong talk.
[00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.040]   Fong talk.
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.040]   Fong talk.
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:57.040]   Coffee talk today.
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.040]   Fong talk.
[00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.520]   Just we can hash.
[00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:00.520]   420.
[00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:01.520]   There you go.
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.160]   Every show be exactly four minutes and 20 seconds long.
[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.160]   It'll be great.
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.160]   At 420.
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.160]   We aired at 420.
[00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:08.520]   Well, I do a little dance.
[00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:09.680]   I'll do this a little later on.
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:13.000]   You know, when it's 1337, I do the little leet dance in here.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.280]   I just get up on the table and I know I'm such a geek.
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:21.880]   So I shouldn't waste time because God Lee, there's a lot of news here.
[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:27.880]   First of all, Eric Schmidt has now confirmed that Google Me is coming soon to a computer
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:30.160]   near you.
[00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.240]   He says, "Sometimes this fall, the Google Me service will introduce what Google calls
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:39.960]   a social layer onto online search, video, Google Maps.
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.920]   This is coming from Googling Google.
[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:48.560]   The aptly named blog from Garrett Rodgers and Christopher Dawson on ZDNet.
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:53.080]   I guess it's both the Wall Street Journal and Reuters were quoting Schmidt saying, "It's
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.080]   coming."
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.480]   In fact, if you are at the Intel Developers Forum today, apparently if you go up to the
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:04.600]   Google booth, there's a guy there who's saying, "Yeah, it's going to be in October."
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:05.600]   Nice.
[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:12.400]   He didn't get the memo, I guess.
[00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.920]   The man manning the Google TV booth, this is from gearlog.com.
[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:22.560]   But the Intel Developer Forum is telling passers-by that Google TV will launch in the October
[00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.400]   November timeframe.
[00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:26.320]   This one guy.
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:27.320]   One guy.
[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:30.560]   The gadget says October 15th.
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:33.080]   Is there any further definition of what the heck it is?
[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:34.720]   Google TV or Google Me?
[00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:35.720]   Me first.
[00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:36.720]   Me first.
[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:37.720]   No.
[00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:38.720]   That's the thing, right?
[00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:39.720]   It kind of changed from what we thought.
[00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:40.720]   Or at least what I thought.
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:45.240]   We were thinking it was going to be this standalone product, sort of like Facebook.
[00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:50.160]   But now it sounds like it's just going to be this layer, this add-on, or an update,
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:51.640]   basically to Google Social.
[00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.200]   Which means practically nothing, right?
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:57.400]   Because I mean, it's kind of, isn't that what you have already?
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:58.400]   Kind of.
[00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.400]   I don't know.
[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.080]   I'm trying to imagine what this would look like.
[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:05.240]   Does it mean that if I search for Mad Men, I see the list of all my Facebook friends that
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.880]   like or have mentioned Mad Men?
[00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.640]   I mean, I imagine that's sort of more what it's about.
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:14.080]   Well you kind of do already if you search on Google for Mad Men.
[00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:19.720]   What they show you results in the Twitter feed from your friends.
[00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:20.720]   Maybe not.
[00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.880]   Maybe I have to click the social button.
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.240]   Yeah, here it is.
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:25.720]   Social results.
[00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.440]   From my circle, my social circle.
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:28.440]   So here's Flickr.
[00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.840]   So it's going to be like this on crack.
[00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:39.200]   I mean, what else could they do to make these results more meaningful or to eject social?
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:42.600]   Is it about making search more social?
[00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:46.240]   It's what we've always said is they have all the pieces already.
[00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:49.880]   They've got buzz for what it's worth.
[00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:55.800]   They've got profiles which are tightly integrated with buzz.
[00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:56.800]   What else would they add?
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:58.760]   They've got social search.
[00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:00.840]   What other pieces would you, oh I know.
[00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:03.880]   And this is actually something that there's been a lot of talk about.
[00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:06.840]   They've got your contacts in Google Voice.
[00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:07.840]   That's another circle.
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:08.840]   Danger.
[00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:09.840]   Danger.
[00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:13.840]   I think he has been talking about this at the Nokia event.
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:15.760]   That's not social.
[00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:19.200]   That was the fundamental mistake with buzz, of course.
[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:22.840]   I often email people I wish I were anti-social with.
[00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:25.640]   Yeah, just that's not a vote for somebody because they're in your address or contact
[00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:26.640]   list.
[00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:27.640]   No.
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:28.640]   I don't know if I call someone a lot.
[00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:31.960]   That person, I mean, I probably, we all probably call maybe five people on a regular
[00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:32.960]   basis.
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:35.600]   I'm not from a state with my prostate surgeon.
[00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:40.120]   It's a super set up here.
[00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:42.680]   And Gina, you're not even in my phone book or address book.
[00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:44.680]   I've never, I don't know your number.
[00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:48.520]   Well, in fact, I was thinking today I was driving home like a madman trying to make
[00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:49.520]   sure I got here.
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:52.240]   If I got hit traffic, I have no way to call anyone from.
[00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:53.680]   We don't have our phone numbers.
[00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:55.520]   We don't need them.
[00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:56.520]   We have your email.
[00:07:56.520 --> 00:07:57.680]   I have your email, obviously.
[00:07:57.680 --> 00:07:58.680]   Right.
[00:07:58.680 --> 00:07:59.680]   Right.
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:00.680]   And we spend an hour together every week.
[00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:03.960]   So, I mean, you got, I talked to you guys more than I do a lot of my closest friends.
[00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:04.960]   Yeah.
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:07.640]   And I could tell you if I were, you are one of my closest friends.
[00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:08.640]   You're my only friend.
[00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:11.000]   I mean, you and Jeff are it.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.200]   No, no, seriously, I feel, I feel very close to you.
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:18.160]   And if I were going to follow anybody and I want suggestions for anybody, it would be
[00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:19.480]   from you too, right?
[00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:20.480]   Yep.
[00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:22.560]   But there, but you don't show up in my contact list.
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:26.240]   The only place we show up together is by every week at this time, we're, which I forgot
[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:28.320]   to do right now, we're tweeting our names together.
[00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:29.840]   So how smart will Google be?
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:32.400]   It could, it could deduce that from that.
[00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:33.400]   It could.
[00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:37.080]   Twitter's done, you know, this new Twitter, I don't want to change subjects, but this
[00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:41.960]   new Twitter surfaces its Twitter suggestions very, you know, I guess it was always on the
[00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:43.680]   front page, which just seems more obvious to me now.
[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:45.320]   I really like the new Twitter.
[00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:46.640]   And those suggestions are very good.
[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:47.640]   I don't know.
[00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:49.600]   But they're obviously doing some clever food.
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:52.080]   They're doing very clever algorithmic work.
[00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:53.080]   Yeah.
[00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:57.160]   But that's, that's perhaps one of the best reasons to buy Twitter is not just, okay,
[00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:59.560]   so Twitter, but there's something very smart going on there.
[00:08:59.560 --> 00:09:05.160]   And it also proves a social graph length that's very powerful and they only know tweeting,
[00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:07.640]   but maybe tweeting is better than your contact list.
[00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:08.800]   In fact, I bet it is.
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:09.800]   I think it is.
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:10.800]   Yeah.
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:11.800]   I think it is.
[00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:16.240]   Well, you know, Zuckerberg said when I talked to him that nobody wants to sit down and make
[00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:18.360]   a list of friends, right?
[00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:19.360]   Right.
[00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:20.360]   It's tedious.
[00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:23.840]   And, and, and they know that especially because when we got opportunities to segregate our
[00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:27.400]   friends into groups, and I thought I wanted that, I don't.
[00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:28.920]   It's, it's, it's a pain.
[00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:31.400]   That your friends context do come.
[00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:35.320]   They are emergent from your actions, from what you do.
[00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:37.440]   It certainly would be, it certainly would be useful.
[00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:41.880]   I mean, I have found it very useful in Google voice and now, and because of it, my context
[00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:46.840]   to, to segregate people because I have different voicemail messages, handle phone calls differently.
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:50.800]   If you guys call me, you would get through, whereas if somebody else that I don't know
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:52.600]   calls, they won't get through automatically.
[00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:55.520]   There's just all sorts of stuff that you do want to do.
[00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:58.880]   But I think the Twitter could have been automatically said, well, not the thing.
[00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:03.360]   The thing is, is that is the Twitter shows shared interests and shared friendships and
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:08.720]   other things, whereas simple communication email phone doesn't.
[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:09.720]   Yeah.
[00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:14.560]   I mean, I'm finding, you know, the Google priority inbox is, is working pretty darned
[00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:15.560]   well.
[00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:18.200]   I mean, it's pretty impressive what I can do.
[00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:22.240]   I have switched, as I mentioned last week, my, all my email to Google because of it.
[00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:23.440]   And how you like it?
[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:24.440]   Fantastic.
[00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:25.440]   Yeah.
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:26.440]   Yeah.
[00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:30.080]   Some people complain, but if you, but all you have to do is, you know, you, you, you,
[00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:33.080]   you kind of massage it a little bit and it gets smarter and smarter.
[00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:34.080]   Yeah.
[00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:35.080]   I think it works.
[00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:36.080]   Yeah.
[00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:38.520]   So, so there's something there in email that I guess does have something that may be, but
[00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:45.840]   again, Google got in such trouble with buzz and buzz doesn't work as a predictor of,
[00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:46.840]   very disappointing.
[00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:47.840]   Relationships.
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:48.840]   Yeah.
[00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:49.840]   They should know better.
[00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:53.560]   In fact, the buzz recommendations is not nearly as good as Twitter's recommended.
[00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:55.040]   Of course, they don't have as much data, do they?
[00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:56.040]   No.
[00:10:56.040 --> 00:11:01.040]   This is where the network effect shows itself in, in some other unusually and maybe look
[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:05.640]   more subtle ways with, when you have a lot of users or even a, you know, something like
[00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:09.840]   a complete universe as Facebook and Twitter almost have, you can do so much of a better
[00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:11.880]   job with a lot of things.
[00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:14.040]   You must see that in your application, Gina.
[00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:15.040]   Yeah.
[00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:18.920]   I mean, I think, I think Jeff's point is a good one in that, you know, you can't, you
[00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:24.280]   can't take a collection of communication habits and then determine necessarily determine
[00:11:24.280 --> 00:11:25.280]   relationships from them, right?
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:26.280]   Because we're a good example.
[00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:27.280]   We talk every week.
[00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:30.080]   We're close, but you know, you wouldn't be able to tell that from our email activity.
[00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:35.240]   But in the, in the context of priority inbox, it's making decisions based solely on your
[00:11:35.240 --> 00:11:36.400]   email activity.
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:40.520]   And I think at one point, it initially marked a message from Jeff as not important.
[00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:41.520]   I marked it as important.
[00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:45.320]   And now anytime I get a message from Jeff, it's important, but like Jeff, you know, we
[00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:46.720]   don't email that much.
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:48.560]   Mostly we do not get too much email, right?
[00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:49.560]   Right.
[00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:50.560]   So I email you guys as little as possible.
[00:11:50.560 --> 00:11:52.440]   So you kind of do have to teach it.
[00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:55.880]   So I think Twitter recommendations work really well because it has, they have a lot of data.
[00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:59.680]   And if you, especially if you interact a lot on Twitter, then it has a lot of data about
[00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:00.680]   you.
[00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:03.560]   I think Facebook does a great job too, but those are closed contacts.
[00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:07.160]   So I mean, I don't know, is Google going to be able to look at all those different
[00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:08.160]   contacts?
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:11.040]   Look at my Skype contacts, look at my Twitter, look at my Facebook, look at my phone call
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:15.240]   log, look at my email and then determine groups based on that?
[00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:16.240]   I'm not sure.
[00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:20.200]   I mean, I, yeah, I think, I don't know, I don't think any company can ever come up with a
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:25.200]   satisfactory list of labels that people would, you know, put their, put their people in buckets.
[00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:26.200]   I don't know.
[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:27.200]   I don't know.
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:32.080]   You're a perfect person for this because think tank, your analytics program does some of
[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:33.200]   this kind of stuff, right?
[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:35.360]   I mean, it does do some of this kind of stuff.
[00:12:35.360 --> 00:12:36.360]   It's called think up now.
[00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:37.360]   Think up, right.
[00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:38.360]   Yeah.
[00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:39.360]   Yeah.
[00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:41.360]   And we are doing some social graph analysis.
[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:44.680]   Although honestly, I'm leaving that to, I'm going to leave that to Twitter is doing that
[00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:46.280]   really well and Facebook does that really well.
[00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:48.040]   So we're not doing too much of that.
[00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:52.280]   The point I think to think up is more just surfacing really good ideas from conversations.
[00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:53.840]   I mean, ideas start in conversations.
[00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:57.640]   So I want think up to kind of archive conversations and surface the good ideas.
[00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:00.400]   And sometimes your relationships has something to do with that.
[00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:01.400]   Like Leo, you're my friend.
[00:13:01.400 --> 00:13:04.640]   So if you respond to a tweet of mine, it's going to show at the top of the list is you're
[00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:05.640]   someone I trust.
[00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:07.160]   Less like a priority inbox.
[00:13:07.160 --> 00:13:08.160]   It's the same kind of thing.
[00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:09.160]   Yeah, it's the same kind of thing.
[00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:12.320]   So I think it's, you know, it's a combination of a lot of things.
[00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:16.520]   Google know, sorry, what could Google know from the web about us?
[00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:21.360]   Well, and there was a lot if it has, you know, and as in my case, four years or five years
[00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:27.160]   of web search history, what could you, what could you squeeze out of that?
[00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:30.000]   Tease out of that to be valuable.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:34.320]   They certainly can, I mean, what they've been looking at it for is ads.
[00:13:34.320 --> 00:13:36.680]   So they know what my interests are.
[00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:40.380]   Why, why would it not work to do use the same technology they use right now for ads
[00:13:40.380 --> 00:13:48.820]   and sense to show me relevant ads, to show me relevant tweets, comments, people, people,
[00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:50.940]   people, same thing, isn't it?
[00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:56.380]   I mean, yeah, for gathering people around interests, that would work really well, even
[00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:57.780]   though it creeped me out a lot.
[00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:08.220]   Well, if I've searched a hundred times for athletes foot, which I haven't, but if I had
[00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:13.420]   a, I would get an ad for athletes foot medicine in my, lots of my pages.
[00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:16.340]   Am I then going to get everybody who says tweets the word athletes foot?
[00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:19.020]   Am I going to see those tweets?
[00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:21.300]   That would be a, that would be a privacy.
[00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:22.300]   I'd hate that.
[00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:23.300]   But nans for the enemies.
[00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:24.300]   Yeah.
[00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:25.300]   That's not going to work.
[00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:26.300]   That's not going to work.
[00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:29.580]   So you have to constrain the subject material.
[00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:34.900]   If I on the other hand, tweet about the Boston Red Sox or search a lot on the Boston Red Sox,
[00:14:34.900 --> 00:14:39.540]   it would be great if I would see stuff content around that.
[00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:43.540]   Yeah, it would be great if you had a friend or if you knew someone or one of your friends
[00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:46.980]   knew someone who was also a really big socks fan, you didn't realize, you know, that's
[00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:50.580]   someone who you're going to want to follow and, you know, talk, talk about the game when
[00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:52.220]   it's on.
[00:14:52.220 --> 00:14:53.420]   So it can do that kind of stuff.
[00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:55.820]   Like here, meet this person that you didn't realize that you know.
[00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:58.860]   So it could be about kind of extending your social graph.
[00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:04.100]   Wouldn't that, but if you're on the other end of that, would that be irritating?
[00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:05.100]   Well, that's the thing.
[00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:10.640]   It's obvious that some things, athletes foot too personal or prostate cancer, but maybe
[00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:11.640]   not for you.
[00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:12.640]   If you're not, I know it's funny.
[00:15:12.640 --> 00:15:13.940]   Maybe you would like to know about it.
[00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:14.940]   So I don't know how they know.
[00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:15.940]   It's not context.
[00:15:15.940 --> 00:15:19.540]   You know, when I go through, I've got a bug in Facebook and I've had it for quite a
[00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:22.140]   while, but it's actually been kind of nice because it's quiet.
[00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:26.140]   It says that I have too many friends when maybe it knows me better than I do, but I don't
[00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:28.220]   have anywhere near 5,000.
[00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:30.220]   I have about half that.
[00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:33.300]   And so it won't let anyone ask to be my friend.
[00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:37.300]   Facebook has very, has become very nanny-ish lately.
[00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:39.820]   When I took this, this is a bug.
[00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:41.260]   This is how it hurts at the same thing.
[00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:44.420]   They say it's a bug and it goes, it went off recently and then it went back on.
[00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:45.420]   So I thought I had to kill.
[00:15:45.420 --> 00:15:50.540]   I also have about 2,500 un-responded friend requests because I just ignore them.
[00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:51.540]   I mean, literally ignore them.
[00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:52.540]   I don't do anything.
[00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:55.940]   So I was going through a bunch trying to kill off enough that I could get to something
[00:15:55.940 --> 00:16:00.860]   because folks, I just befriend people I actually know, are met.
[00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:08.220]   And the ones who came from friend to find her met nothing to me.
[00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:11.460]   Where Facebook was saying, "You should know this person.
[00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:12.460]   It didn't mean anything."
[00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:15.780]   Whereas when Twitter says that, it means something to me.
[00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:20.540]   So maybe Twitter's got some secret sauce that's going to be very hard.
[00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:23.300]   Twitter keeps coming up the winter in this particular segment.
[00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:28.540]   And better than Facebook, much better than I think Google's done.
[00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:30.340]   So what can Google do?
[00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:35.020]   It's just hard to imagine.
[00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:36.020]   A social layer.
[00:16:36.020 --> 00:16:40.100]   I mean, they've already done the one thing that it's obvious, which is adding social
[00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:41.100]   to your search.
[00:16:41.100 --> 00:16:43.300]   Kevin, come on.
[00:16:43.300 --> 00:16:45.100]   You don't get to sit there quietly.
[00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:46.100]   I know.
[00:16:46.100 --> 00:16:50.020]   I was thinking that would be great if there was like, it's almost be like delicious.
[00:16:50.020 --> 00:16:54.420]   The idea that you just have this bin that you throw things in for Google to look at.
[00:16:54.420 --> 00:16:59.020]   Like you said, you don't want athletes' foot, but you do want Android or you want.
[00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:01.140]   That solves the privacy problem, doesn't it?
[00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:02.380]   Because it's all volitional.
[00:17:02.380 --> 00:17:03.380]   It's all opt in.
[00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:09.700]   Yeah, but how do you get the user behavior such that it's not annoying for them to hit
[00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:11.220]   a button, throw it in.
[00:17:11.220 --> 00:17:15.060]   Even the Google search results experiment where you can move things up and down and
[00:17:15.060 --> 00:17:21.300]   vote, cross them out from your results and get personalized with search wiki, it was
[00:17:21.300 --> 00:17:23.300]   called, right?
[00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:24.300]   Yeah.
[00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:25.300]   Side wiki.
[00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:26.300]   Side wiki.
[00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:29.660]   Well, and then also just the hitting up and down on the individual search results, that
[00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:32.660]   didn't work out that hot or a lot of people didn't like that.
[00:17:32.660 --> 00:17:34.420]   Do they still do that even?
[00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:35.420]   I would.
[00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:36.420]   Thank you.
[00:17:36.420 --> 00:17:37.420]   No, no, the search.
[00:17:37.420 --> 00:17:39.420]   The changing the search results.
[00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:40.420]   Yeah.
[00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:46.220]   And yeah, I think it was a tricky one button that you can hit to say, yes, no, good bad.
[00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:47.220]   I think that's gone.
[00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:49.220]   I don't see it anymore.
[00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:52.740]   The lesson is that people don't want to have to curate.
[00:17:52.740 --> 00:17:54.140]   They don't want to have to organize things.
[00:17:54.140 --> 00:17:56.220]   You know, I don't even have my iTunes library organized.
[00:17:56.220 --> 00:17:57.220]   My house is a mess.
[00:17:57.220 --> 00:17:58.220]   You know what I mean?
[00:17:58.220 --> 00:18:00.220]   Like, I don't want to have to organize all my information always and be like, oh, this
[00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:04.660]   goes in this box, this goes in this box, whether it's my contacts or okay, but, but,
[00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:08.460]   but, but, but, but priority inbox.
[00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:09.460]   Takes a stab at it.
[00:18:09.460 --> 00:18:12.420]   And then you don't mind so much tweaking it.
[00:18:12.420 --> 00:18:13.420]   That's true.
[00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:16.380]   That's true because, and it seems reporting span because I know that it's going to save
[00:18:16.380 --> 00:18:17.980]   me a moment in the future.
[00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:18.980]   It's worth it.
[00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:19.980]   It's worth it.
[00:18:19.980 --> 00:18:21.900]   I know that Jeff's email is going to mark this is important in the future.
[00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:23.780]   So then it's worth it for me to hit that hit that button.
[00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:25.620]   I guess, yeah, I guess that's the difference, right?
[00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:29.580]   So I didn't, I never really curated or thumbs up my search results because I felt like,
[00:18:29.580 --> 00:18:31.140]   what am I ever going to search for this again?
[00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:32.140]   I just need this now.
[00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:34.740]   It feels like, it feels like you're throwing a rocket kill him in Jaro.
[00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:37.620]   It's like you're, you're not really changing something that's going to have a, you know,
[00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:38.860]   long term effective feels like.
[00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:41.980]   Well, and wasn't immediately apparent that it was changing anything for the better either.
[00:18:41.980 --> 00:18:42.980]   It was just changing it.
[00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:43.980]   Yeah.
[00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:46.540]   I made me nervous because I thought, well, I don't want to screw with my search results.
[00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:48.580]   I want, I want, that's Google's job.
[00:18:48.580 --> 00:18:52.220]   I don't want to bring something up and have it come up too high because I brought it up.
[00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:54.220]   Yeah, the social buy in is pretty low.
[00:18:54.220 --> 00:18:56.940]   Like I really want to help people find, you know, Gillette razor blades later.
[00:18:56.940 --> 00:18:58.540]   I got to make sure I marked this up.
[00:18:58.540 --> 00:18:59.540]   Right.
[00:18:59.540 --> 00:19:01.100]   So that's, that's interesting.
[00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:04.660]   So again, this comes back to something I said a few weeks ago, which is Google needs not
[00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:06.980]   more computer scientists, but more social scientists.
[00:19:06.980 --> 00:19:08.820]   Oh, yeah, more anthropologists.
[00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:11.220]   This is their real, this is the whole problem.
[00:19:11.220 --> 00:19:12.220]   Right.
[00:19:12.220 --> 00:19:16.500]   And you get the feeling that everybody's doing it by instinct and it's whoever's instinct
[00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:18.540]   was best.
[00:19:18.540 --> 00:19:21.980]   Everybody said, whenever I use Facebook, I saw this.
[00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:22.980]   It was a great tweet.
[00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:24.620]   I wish I could remember who said it.
[00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:30.020]   I can do only exactly what Mark Zuckerberg has figured out I want to do or could should
[00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:34.740]   do and nothing more because it's so clearly a personal project.
[00:19:34.740 --> 00:19:35.740]   It's not a platform.
[00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:36.740]   It's not a platform.
[00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:43.300]   Whereas you can use Craigslist to find family members after Katrina, you can use it to do
[00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:44.300]   anything.
[00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:45.300]   That's it.
[00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:48.780]   That's what Google's saying is we're going to be able to platform.
[00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:53.340]   But now to make a platform work you need buy in from not just users, but more importantly,
[00:19:53.340 --> 00:19:54.340]   developers.
[00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:56.060]   Is that right?
[00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:57.060]   That's true.
[00:19:57.060 --> 00:19:58.060]   Yeah.
[00:19:58.060 --> 00:19:59.060]   That's true.
[00:19:59.060 --> 00:20:00.060]   Yeah.
[00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:02.500]   You know, going back to the Facebook thing, a Neil Das wrote this great post about, about
[00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:05.380]   Facebook, but I guess there was that in that New Yorker profile is Zuckerberg.
[00:20:05.380 --> 00:20:09.420]   I guess he said that he, he, he realized that he's red, green color blind.
[00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:14.660]   So that's part of the reason why Facebook is blue is because he can fully see blue.
[00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:16.820]   That proves the point exactly.
[00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:24.940]   So literally Facebook is limited by Zuckerberg's like ability to see colors.
[00:20:24.940 --> 00:20:26.940]   So I, that was amazing to me.
[00:20:26.940 --> 00:20:29.660]   I haven't really, I've only scanned that New Yorker profile.
[00:20:29.660 --> 00:20:30.660]   By the way, it is online.
[00:20:30.660 --> 00:20:34.540]   So you don't have to be a New Yorker subscriber to read it.
[00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:38.660]   But Mark also admitted, yeah, yeah, that email that was circulating a few months ago
[00:20:38.660 --> 00:20:42.820]   where I said the, those dumb F's, they're giving me all the information.
[00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:43.820]   Yeah.
[00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:49.260]   It was pretty candid to interview, but you know, it seems to be pretty clear that what's happening
[00:20:49.260 --> 00:20:54.820]   here is they're, they're bringing Mark around to buff up his image prior to the release of
[00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:55.820]   the social media.
[00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:56.820]   Yeah.
[00:20:56.820 --> 00:20:59.820]   Because movie's going to slaughter the poor kid.
[00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:00.820]   Yeah.
[00:21:00.820 --> 00:21:06.820]   Peter Kafka at Media Memo said that it wasn't a amazing movie, but he wouldn't want to be
[00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:07.820]   Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:08.820]   Yeah.
[00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:09.820]   And see it.
[00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:10.820]   Yeah.
[00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:11.820]   Yeah.
[00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:16.820]   And I haven't said, I'm looking forward to seeing how they make programming interesting.
[00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:21.100]   Like if they'll do the, you know, the hackers type thing where he's typing and he, you know,
[00:21:21.100 --> 00:21:25.540]   breaks the encryption in one night, you know, writes an entire code base overnight with
[00:21:25.540 --> 00:21:29.180]   just like, you know, Mountain Dew and Pringles or something.
[00:21:29.180 --> 00:21:31.180]   Dramatic typing, fencing typing.
[00:21:31.180 --> 00:21:32.180]   Dramatic typing.
[00:21:32.180 --> 00:21:33.180]   Yeah.
[00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:34.940]   Forget the dramatic Perry dog.
[00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:36.100]   We need dramatic chip on.
[00:21:36.100 --> 00:21:37.100]   We need dramatic typing.
[00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:41.020]   It's all going to be, it's all going to be montage fast cut.
[00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:42.020]   It's all whiteboarding.
[00:21:42.020 --> 00:21:43.020]   I think.
[00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:44.020]   Yeah.
[00:21:44.020 --> 00:21:45.020]   It's a lot of whiteboarding.
[00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:46.020]   Yeah.
[00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:47.020]   Yeah.
[00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:48.020]   Whiteboarding.
[00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:49.020]   There you go.
[00:21:49.020 --> 00:21:50.020]   Well, you, you know, Mark Zuckerberg did not whiteboard one damn thing.
[00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:55.580]   Oh, actually, actually he told me that he remembers the day when he whiteboarded the social
[00:21:55.580 --> 00:21:57.380]   graph for the first time in his dorm room.
[00:21:57.380 --> 00:21:58.380]   Yeah.
[00:21:58.380 --> 00:21:59.380]   He had a whiteboard in his dorm room.
[00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:00.380]   His dorm room.
[00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:01.380]   Yeah.
[00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:02.380]   That's the beautiful part.
[00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:03.380]   Yes.
[00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:04.220]   Well, I take it back.
[00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:07.020]   I guess I misunderestimated him.
[00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:08.020]   No.
[00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:09.020]   No.
[00:22:09.020 --> 00:22:12.100]   So, well, so we're going to have Google me and Google TV.
[00:22:12.100 --> 00:22:14.460]   Oh, well, you're just not going to know what it's going to be.
[00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:15.460]   Google you.
[00:22:15.460 --> 00:22:16.460]   Yeah.
[00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:17.460]   It's one's going to be.
[00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:18.460]   Oh, my Google TV.
[00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:21.860]   I mean, he was hoping that Facebook would open up their contact data, their social graph
[00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:24.180]   data to Google, which isn't going to happen.
[00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:27.020]   But Twitter's social contact data is open to Google.
[00:22:27.020 --> 00:22:28.620]   It's going to be interesting to see, right?
[00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:31.500]   I mean, if Google's going to do sort of recommendations that Twitter's doing, who's going to do a
[00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:33.460]   better job of that Twitter or Google?
[00:22:33.460 --> 00:22:34.580]   So that's part of the API.
[00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:38.540]   You can suck that stuff from Facebook or do they have the fire hose at Google?
[00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:40.260]   Yeah, they have the Twitter fire hose.
[00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:42.700]   So that the social graph data, yeah, is all available.
[00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:43.700]   I guess it would be.
[00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:44.700]   Yeah.
[00:22:44.700 --> 00:22:48.740]   And I assume that Google has, you know, super duper access to the social graph fire.
[00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:50.940]   Remember what happened when Apple said, Oh, yeah.
[00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:54.220]   And by the way, you'll be able to use Facebook Connect on Ping.
[00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:57.100]   And Facebook said, Oh, no, you won't.
[00:22:57.100 --> 00:23:01.500]   Wait, it was Facebook that said, no, it was jobs.
[00:23:01.500 --> 00:23:08.060]   I thought it was jobs that according to Cara Swisher, jobs told her that that day and the
[00:23:08.060 --> 00:23:11.580]   announcement of Ping that they had planned to have Facebook and they, he showed it.
[00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:13.740]   They had Facebook Connect built into it.
[00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:17.300]   But if you are a, and that's part of the API, but if you're a big player and might suck
[00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:22.460]   a lot of bandwidth, they want you to negotiate a deal on jobs told Cara, boy, Facebook's
[00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:23.860]   driving a hard bargain.
[00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:26.060]   The terms are too onerous.
[00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:29.220]   So you think that was about price that you don't think that was about?
[00:23:29.220 --> 00:23:30.780]   No, I don't think it's money necessarily.
[00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:31.780]   Who knows what the terms were.
[00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:32.780]   They might not date it back.
[00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:33.780]   Who knows?
[00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:34.780]   That's what I thought.
[00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:36.700]   That's why I assume, but it could be the price.
[00:23:36.700 --> 00:23:43.180]   So yeah, who knows who pulled the plug, but it's clear that if Facebook doesn't want to
[00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:48.900]   play along, we don't have, you know, Google doesn't necessarily get that data and Facebook
[00:23:48.900 --> 00:23:50.180]   is going to act in its own bit.
[00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:51.900]   This is one thing very clear.
[00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:56.220]   Facebook is going to act in its own best interest, not in the interest of the internet.
[00:23:56.220 --> 00:24:00.620]   It would be in the interest of all for all of this data to be unsilowed and available.
[00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:01.620]   That's when you get it.
[00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:04.660]   Then the network effect doesn't matter because everybody's got access to everything and you
[00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:09.580]   can build this, you know, it's whoever's smartest about parsing the data.
[00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:14.700]   And Facebook and Twitter, to a lesser degree, I guess, their attitude is what we got the
[00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:15.700]   data.
[00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:17.420]   So, you know, it's not about that.
[00:24:17.420 --> 00:24:19.460]   I guess Twitter is pretty open with the data.
[00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:21.860]   It'd be great if you could still wish.
[00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:22.860]   Go ahead.
[00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:23.860]   Sorry.
[00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:26.020]   It would be great if you with all the OAuth work that Google's doing you, there's so
[00:24:26.020 --> 00:24:30.180]   many apps now, web apps that you can sign in with your Google credentials more and more.
[00:24:30.180 --> 00:24:31.180]   I see every day.
[00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:37.460]   It would be great if they would allow you to use your Google OAuth to let certain parts
[00:24:37.460 --> 00:24:38.780]   of your data go.
[00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:41.660]   Like you were just saying, like, you know, kind of peel your own onion out and say,
[00:24:41.660 --> 00:24:45.740]   "Well, I'm going to let Google use this and this and this and my search results by signing
[00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:48.060]   in and letting some of it go."
[00:24:48.060 --> 00:24:50.940]   I mean, they kind of do that, but not really now.
[00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:55.260]   Well, you can also see why it's in Google's interest to promote the open web because they
[00:24:55.260 --> 00:24:56.940]   ain't got nothing.
[00:24:56.940 --> 00:25:00.980]   So the open web benefits, it's a one-way street from their point of view, a data flowing
[00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:04.660]   from Facebook and Twitter to Google.
[00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:08.020]   And you can see why Facebook and Twitter might say, "Well, maybe not."
[00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:09.860]   Look at it another way.
[00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:12.740]   What could Google do that would disrupt the hell on a Facebook?
[00:25:12.740 --> 00:25:15.100]   That's the question, isn't it?
[00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:17.380]   Because you can't get on cooperation.
[00:25:17.380 --> 00:25:26.500]   I go back to your idea that if I had my basically my personality server, if my page, my identity
[00:25:26.500 --> 00:25:35.300]   were on Google and I could serve up my data to other parties, that's still the wish.
[00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:36.300]   Does that disrupt Facebook?
[00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:41.780]   Well, that's what I thought profile was kind of about Google profile is you control your
[00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:42.780]   information.
[00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:45.500]   Because we're not going to leave Facebook.
[00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:46.500]   No.
[00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:49.460]   You learned that lesson, didn't you, sir?
[00:25:49.460 --> 00:25:50.460]   Yeah.
[00:25:50.460 --> 00:25:51.460]   Sad.
[00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:52.460]   Embarrassingly.
[00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:53.460]   You will not leave.
[00:25:53.460 --> 00:25:54.460]   You can't.
[00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:56.460]   You'll think you've left, but you have not left.
[00:25:56.460 --> 00:25:59.060]   I've left Twitter a couple of times too.
[00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:02.180]   Yeah, you got to be where the people are.
[00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:03.180]   For the world's country.
[00:26:03.180 --> 00:26:06.980]   Don't you get pissed at things and leave them, don't you?
[00:26:06.980 --> 00:26:07.980]   Yeah.
[00:26:07.980 --> 00:26:09.980]   I have a short excuse.
[00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:12.180]   I'm kicking my ball and going home.
[00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:18.620]   Well, look, in theory, and this is I think one of the promises of the internet era, there's
[00:26:18.620 --> 00:26:19.940]   everything's friction-free.
[00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:24.900]   There's no, doesn't need to be loyalty because there's a bunch of companies competing.
[00:26:24.900 --> 00:26:27.100]   Bookmarking is a good example.
[00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:31.020]   There's a bunch of companies with bookmarking services and it's friction-free as long as
[00:26:31.020 --> 00:26:32.540]   data moves freely.
[00:26:32.540 --> 00:26:35.820]   If there aren't artificial constraints on data, it's friction-free.
[00:26:35.820 --> 00:26:38.020]   And so you just move around to where you want to live.
[00:26:38.020 --> 00:26:42.340]   The problem is in practice, it isn't because data isn't friction-free.
[00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:43.860]   You can move friction-free.
[00:26:43.860 --> 00:26:47.740]   You can use different search engines because how much they know about you is irrelevant,
[00:26:47.740 --> 00:26:51.420]   but you can't use different bookmark engines unless they let you export an import.
[00:26:51.420 --> 00:26:55.620]   And you certainly can't use different social networks unless your friends can somehow see
[00:26:55.620 --> 00:26:58.260]   you or participate with you on that other network.
[00:26:58.260 --> 00:27:02.340]   And that's what I learned is that exactly the thing I didn't like about Facebook, which
[00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:07.660]   is that it's a silo, is exactly the thing that protects it and makes means I can't leave
[00:27:07.660 --> 00:27:10.860]   it because that's where everybody is.
[00:27:10.860 --> 00:27:13.820]   Twitter to a pretty much the same degree, I have to say.
[00:27:13.820 --> 00:27:21.380]   When I left Twitter in April 2007, very early, I had 5,000 followers.
[00:27:21.380 --> 00:27:23.980]   And I think I was number one or number two.
[00:27:23.980 --> 00:27:25.780]   And I last said, "This is it.
[00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:28.460]   I can't use Twitter for a number of reasons."
[00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:32.620]   And when I came back, there was nowhere else.
[00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:33.620]   Nobody followed.
[00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:35.900]   I was like, "Charge over the hill."
[00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:36.900]   Where are you?
[00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:38.860]   Where did you go?
[00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:40.540]   Where did everybody go?
[00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:43.540]   But Jaiku is so much better.
[00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:46.540]   And even -- and I first thought, "Oh, people can't see that it's better."
[00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:48.020]   And now I realize it has nothing to do with that.
[00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:50.380]   It has to do with all this inertia.
[00:27:50.380 --> 00:27:51.380]   Critical mass.
[00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:53.380]   It's critical mass.
[00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:55.420]   And when it's a silo, you're going to have critical mass.
[00:27:55.420 --> 00:27:59.700]   So it's in Google's interest that all this stuff be open and freely transported and given
[00:27:59.700 --> 00:28:01.180]   away.
[00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:04.700]   And because Google has -- they have some data, but they don't have the people.
[00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:07.740]   I mean, I think that there's two winners in the world going forward.
[00:28:07.740 --> 00:28:10.940]   I was saying this to somebody in media the other day, those who have data and those ever
[00:28:10.940 --> 00:28:12.420]   relationships.
[00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:17.660]   And the winner of winners is the ones who have relationships that produce data.
[00:28:17.660 --> 00:28:19.020]   Does Google have that kind of relationship?
[00:28:19.020 --> 00:28:20.020]   No, that's the problem.
[00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:21.020]   It doesn't.
[00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:22.020]   Twitter does.
[00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:24.020]   Facebook certainly does.
[00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:27.540]   Well, I feel like Twitter is such a big winner right now.
[00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:29.820]   Did you watch the Video Music Awards?
[00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:34.740]   They kept putting up a billboard of how many -- 8 billion tweets an hour now.
[00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:37.540]   And Lady Gaga's number one and number two is Justin Bieber.
[00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:43.740]   I mean, Twitter was all over the VMA, which shows that it's a youth movement, which is
[00:28:43.740 --> 00:28:44.740]   very good.
[00:28:44.740 --> 00:28:45.740]   It's what you want.
[00:28:45.740 --> 00:28:46.740]   Which everyone says it wasn't.
[00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:50.180]   Oh, the kids don't use it for us like you Leo and you.
[00:28:50.180 --> 00:28:51.180]   Yeah.
[00:28:51.180 --> 00:28:52.180]   No.
[00:28:52.180 --> 00:28:54.700]   Twitter's numbers still don't come close to Facebook's though, right?
[00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:55.700]   They're getting close.
[00:28:55.700 --> 00:28:56.700]   Really?
[00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:58.780]   Well, I think it was over 100 million.
[00:28:58.780 --> 00:29:00.860]   It was 180 million.
[00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:02.180]   And what is Facebook have?
[00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:03.180]   Half a billion.
[00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:04.980]   Yeah, 500.
[00:29:04.980 --> 00:29:05.980]   But that's close.
[00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:06.980]   Come on.
[00:29:06.980 --> 00:29:07.980]   What's a few hundred million?
[00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:08.980]   Yeah, I just don't know.
[00:29:08.980 --> 00:29:09.980]   Sometimes I think -- I agree.
[00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:13.100]   Listen, I prefer Twitter over Facebook, but I've talked to people who are just like,
[00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:14.540]   "Twitter doesn't drive half the traffic.
[00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:16.260]   It doesn't have half the users as Facebook does."
[00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:19.820]   And I think the reason why we see it at the VMA's and things like that is because Twitter's
[00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:22.140]   default is that that information is public.
[00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:23.740]   So they can show all the tweets.
[00:29:23.740 --> 00:29:24.740]   Right.
[00:29:24.740 --> 00:29:28.620]   So Facebook doesn't do that kind of stuff because the idea is that it's like come and
[00:29:28.620 --> 00:29:29.620]   slide the wall garden.
[00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:34.380]   I mean, could Facebook technically show a list of status updates that mention the VMAs?
[00:29:34.380 --> 00:29:35.380]   They couldn't, right?
[00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:36.380]   Is there a way?
[00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:42.500]   Well, remember with the Obama inauguration that you could sign in through Facebook and
[00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:45.260]   you could leave things that your friends would see, but you could also make them public.
[00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:48.260]   Remember the election page, which was such a great page.
[00:29:48.260 --> 00:29:50.020]   It was real time.
[00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:51.260]   It was scrolling up.
[00:29:51.260 --> 00:29:53.740]   It was great because it was your social graph plus.
[00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:56.100]   You could just watch your fat tabs, right?
[00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:58.780]   You could just watch your friends or you could watch everyone?
[00:29:58.780 --> 00:29:59.780]   Yeah.
[00:29:59.780 --> 00:30:03.660]   Then you found out how many of your friends can be online on Facebook at 11 AM.
[00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:05.860]   Why don't we kind of work day?
[00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:06.860]   Yeah.
[00:30:06.860 --> 00:30:09.340]   You'll see either one.
[00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:10.340]   You're right, Gina.
[00:30:10.340 --> 00:30:12.940]   That goes back to the problems that Facebook has had before.
[00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:18.780]   My ridiculous screen about understanding a public versus the public.
[00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:23.020]   Facebook is designed for us to speak to our private public, not to the whole world.
[00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:24.940]   And Zuckerberg is clearly jealous of that.
[00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:25.940]   Oh, man.
[00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:27.860]   He must be watching the VMAs going, "Ting!"
[00:30:27.860 --> 00:30:28.860]   Yeah.
[00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:32.620]   I mean, I think Twitter has really good connections in Hollywood as well.
[00:30:32.620 --> 00:30:33.620]   Oh, yeah.
[00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:34.620]   Hollywood loves Twitter.
[00:30:34.620 --> 00:30:35.620]   Yeah.
[00:30:35.620 --> 00:30:38.260]   In a way that not so much is not much is Facebook.
[00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:42.220]   Well, if you're Steve Martin who just joined Twitter today and already has 50,000 followers,
[00:30:42.220 --> 00:30:47.820]   if you're Steve Martin, and you want to post funny bomos and here's where you can get
[00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:50.020]   my book, where are you going to do that?
[00:30:50.020 --> 00:30:51.020]   Not on Facebook.
[00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:52.020]   You're going to have a Facebook page.
[00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:53.020]   I'm sure he does.
[00:30:53.020 --> 00:30:56.420]   You're going to have a like button on your blog, of course.
[00:30:56.420 --> 00:30:57.420]   But where are you really?
[00:30:57.420 --> 00:30:58.420]   Where's your big megaphone?
[00:30:58.420 --> 00:30:59.420]   Where's your big megaphone?
[00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:00.420]   Well, it's different too.
[00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:08.300]   I learned talking to son Jake when we visited Zuckerberg that Jake's peers look at the wall
[00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:10.420]   as a place to have a conversation.
[00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:13.020]   My peers look at it as a place to publish and broadcast.
[00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:14.020]   Right.
[00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:15.020]   Right.
[00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:18.780]   And so I think that functionally they just don't operate the same.
[00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:21.100]   And you got to have the relationship or there's danger.
[00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:22.580]   By the way, I'll report this.
[00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:23.660]   I haven't seen this anywhere else.
[00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:30.860]   So I contacted the detective in the National at New Hampshire so-called Facebook robberies
[00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:34.660]   where they had the whole string of robberies, right?
[00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:36.860]   And they were supposedly they'd done it off Facebook.
[00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:37.860]   Yeah.
[00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:40.220]   And they said, well, it wasn't places.
[00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:41.460]   And then they gave me the name of the detective.
[00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:44.740]   I went to the detective and it's still an ongoing investigation.
[00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:48.780]   But he said that in both cases, there were only two cases where Facebook was involved
[00:31:48.780 --> 00:31:50.620]   in this robbery string.
[00:31:50.620 --> 00:31:54.060]   And in both cases, the victims were friends with-
[00:31:54.060 --> 00:31:55.060]   Wow.
[00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:57.260]   Of course, because it's friends.
[00:31:57.260 --> 00:31:58.260]   Exactly.
[00:31:58.260 --> 00:32:02.420]   So, you know, the status updates could be public.
[00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:06.860]   But they, in that case, it was only because they were stupid enough to befriend bad guys.
[00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:07.860]   Yeah.
[00:32:07.860 --> 00:32:10.700]   And almost that of the burglaries all the time.
[00:32:10.700 --> 00:32:14.260]   Any police officer tell you, most burglaries are, you know, friends of friends or someone,
[00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:16.220]   you know, was in your house at a certain point.
[00:32:16.220 --> 00:32:19.980]   So it's just, it's a new way for people to check in on your house.
[00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:21.580]   If they know you.
[00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:23.580]   Good on you on doing that research.
[00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:25.180]   I'm going to, I got to blog that a little later.
[00:32:25.180 --> 00:32:26.180]   Yeah.
[00:32:26.180 --> 00:32:28.620]   Little, little, little, actual reporting revealed here on Twitch.
[00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:32.820]   She's, it's like everybody is so anxious to believe these stories that they don't really
[00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:34.540]   actually want to debunk it.
[00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:35.540]   Yeah.
[00:32:35.540 --> 00:32:38.100]   They want it to be true.
[00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:40.820]   So you must be interested in this story.
[00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:47.700]   Google, I mean, sorry, Apple working on a deal with newspapers to be cut, to turn the
[00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:50.540]   iPad into the new platform.
[00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:51.540]   Did you see this?
[00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:52.540]   Oh, yeah.
[00:32:52.540 --> 00:32:57.140]   It's, it's, it's, I know that Jeff is just a world we worry about this.
[00:32:57.140 --> 00:32:58.700]   You've seen it all before.
[00:32:58.700 --> 00:32:59.700]   Haven't you, Jarvis?
[00:32:59.700 --> 00:33:01.940]   Am I allowed to say wet dream?
[00:33:01.940 --> 00:33:02.940]   Yeah.
[00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:03.940]   Is it, is it a wet dream?
[00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:04.940]   Yeah.
[00:33:04.940 --> 00:33:05.940]   It is.
[00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:10.540]   It's, it's, it's the newspapers are still believing like magazines that it's not your,
[00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:11.540]   it's not your wet dream.
[00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:12.540]   It's theirs.
[00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:13.540]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:33:13.540 --> 00:33:14.540]   Yeah, it's theirs.
[00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:18.100]   It's, it's their belief that the iPad is going to return control of the experience of
[00:33:18.100 --> 00:33:19.100]   the business model to them.
[00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:23.620]   And we're all going to rush to subscribe now that we have the opportunity and the argument
[00:33:23.620 --> 00:33:28.220]   will be made that what we did for music, you bought there, but music is unique and news
[00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:29.940]   is not.
[00:33:29.940 --> 00:33:34.140]   And then as a Mercury news says Apple to announce subscription plan for newspaper.
[00:33:34.140 --> 00:33:40.140]   This is John Boudreau writing yesterday and updating it this morning.
[00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:46.380]   Roger Fiddler held head of the digital publishing at the Donald W Reynolds journalism Institute
[00:33:46.380 --> 00:33:47.780]   in Columbia, Missouri.
[00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:48.780]   Is that it?
[00:33:48.780 --> 00:33:49.780]   Well known.
[00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:50.780]   Yeah, it actually is.
[00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:54.780]   It's a, it's a, it says Apple will take a 30% cut of all subscriptions sold through the
[00:33:54.780 --> 00:33:55.780]   app store.
[00:33:55.780 --> 00:34:00.420]   And, and as much as 40% of the ad revenue.
[00:34:00.420 --> 00:34:06.660]   So of course it looks, I mean, Apple's smart play on these poor newspapers fears.
[00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:13.740]   Yeah, we can save you and it will only cost you a little bit.
[00:34:13.740 --> 00:34:16.340]   And whether it works or not, Apple doesn't care.
[00:34:16.340 --> 00:34:17.340]   No, no.
[00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:21.860]   Uh, Cupertino has agreed to provide an opt in function for subscribers.
[00:34:21.860 --> 00:34:22.860]   This is interesting.
[00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:27.740]   Because Apple to share with publishers their information.
[00:34:27.740 --> 00:34:31.020]   Publishers want the data from their customers so they can integrate it into their circulation
[00:34:31.020 --> 00:34:33.500]   database so they know who their customers are.
[00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:34.500]   But you can turn that off.
[00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:39.020]   That's a bit of a contention with, with a newspaper with publishers and Apple.
[00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:40.020]   Right.
[00:34:40.020 --> 00:34:45.260]   Is it Apple quote unquote owns the relationship as if anyone can own us, but well, Apple thinks
[00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:46.260]   it does.
[00:34:46.260 --> 00:34:47.260]   Oh, yeah.
[00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:48.260]   Yeah.
[00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:52.820]   Publishers wanted to pay a fee, but eventually because they have no choice agreed to.
[00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:55.700]   They're saying, right.
[00:34:55.700 --> 00:35:01.100]   And they're, and they're the same problem that boat with, with Amazon where more than
[00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:06.700]   half the revenue from Amazon subscriptions goes to Sprint and the majority of what's left
[00:35:06.700 --> 00:35:10.060]   goes to the publisher, but it's so tiny as to not be at all worth it.
[00:35:10.060 --> 00:35:11.420]   And it's also a crappy experience.
[00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:12.420]   Well, that's interesting.
[00:35:12.420 --> 00:35:16.140]   So if I'm the New York Times and I, if I subscribe to the New York Times on Kindle, which I did
[00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:20.340]   for a long time, most of that money goes to Sprint and a little bit to Amazon and nothing
[00:35:20.340 --> 00:35:22.940]   to the Seltzberger family.
[00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:29.220]   Oh, no, no, no, the half more than half, which I presume is 51% of what's left over after
[00:35:29.220 --> 00:35:33.540]   Sprint goes to Seltzberger, but it amounts to Bupkis.
[00:35:33.540 --> 00:35:40.540]   More than half is Bupkis compared to what you would get if you got a weekly subscription.
[00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:41.540]   Yeah.
[00:35:41.540 --> 00:35:42.540]   But now the, okay.
[00:35:42.540 --> 00:35:45.900]   So the Wall Street Journal, which I also subscribed to on here, which is actually fairly
[00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:46.900]   expensive.
[00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:47.900]   Yes.
[00:35:47.900 --> 00:35:51.340]   On the iPad, does Apple take 30%?
[00:35:51.340 --> 00:35:53.000]   I guess they do have the subscription fee.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   Yeah.
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:55.900]   They take whatever they negotiated in that case for that.
[00:35:55.900 --> 00:35:59.940]   But yeah, they take that plus, but what I don't understand Leo is the 40% of the ad revenue.
[00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:02.420]   I wonder if they're talking about iPads, the Apple ad platform.
[00:36:02.420 --> 00:36:08.140]   I think they probably are, but I wonder whether Apple's going to require, pardon me, some use
[00:36:08.140 --> 00:36:12.100]   of iPads in the newspaper apps to get into the newspaper store.
[00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:15.700]   If they did, they would just show how much they have the newspaper publishers over a barrel.
[00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:19.300]   If they could dictate, oh, and by the way, we'll be selling those ads.
[00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:21.500]   Yeah, that would be insane.
[00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:23.700]   That would be something.
[00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:28.220]   It would not, it would not be appropriate for you to sell your own advertising in this
[00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:32.140]   to me, I wouldn't because something could, terrible could happen.
[00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:33.580]   Geez, Louise.
[00:36:33.580 --> 00:36:38.300]   But I guess when you got somebody like, you know, desperate, they're trying to preserve
[00:36:38.300 --> 00:36:39.300]   an old business level.
[00:36:39.300 --> 00:36:40.300]   It's desperate.
[00:36:40.300 --> 00:36:42.540]   It's just not going to work.
[00:36:42.540 --> 00:36:45.660]   I feel like yesterday with the new Twitter, Twitter kind of landed on the side of the
[00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:46.660]   web over apps.
[00:36:46.660 --> 00:36:48.660]   I thought that was really kind of interesting.
[00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:49.660]   Let's talk about that.
[00:36:49.660 --> 00:36:51.980]   Google's position on things.
[00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:54.380]   So we kind of have this divergence going on.
[00:36:54.380 --> 00:37:00.180]   If I were a third party Twitter developer, I'd be a little unhappy about this, especially
[00:37:00.180 --> 00:37:03.860]   if I were someone like Brizzly, which is a web-based Twitter client.
[00:37:03.860 --> 00:37:10.140]   Yeah, you have to have something that Twitter.com doesn't have.
[00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:12.100]   Like something like co-tweet is great.
[00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:16.500]   It offers this ability for a team to tweet from a single handle, but to just be a Twitter
[00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:20.820]   client at this point, you've got to offer something that Twitter.com doesn't.
[00:37:20.820 --> 00:37:22.500]   And the new Twitter does a lot.
[00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:29.100]   Well, even more interesting, Twitter is finally putting conversations in because mentioned
[00:37:29.100 --> 00:37:33.820]   in this tweet, retweeted by tweets mentioning this tweets.
[00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:41.300]   If you open up this sidebar on a tweet, pardon me, there's a lot of metadata there.
[00:37:41.300 --> 00:37:43.820]   The conversations are pretty limiting.
[00:37:43.820 --> 00:37:49.420]   It's just the reply and the one it replied to, but you don't get the full thread.
[00:37:49.420 --> 00:37:51.620]   If there's a long back and forth, which that's a challenge.
[00:37:51.620 --> 00:37:55.380]   I was trying to do that with think up and it's a little bit of a challenge.
[00:37:55.380 --> 00:37:57.060]   But yeah, there's quite a bit of metadata there.
[00:37:57.060 --> 00:38:02.020]   And if you have a tweet with location, it'll show a map.
[00:38:02.020 --> 00:38:04.860]   If you click on any location, you see a tweet to that location, it really services a lot
[00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:11.140]   of the data that Twitter has hidden because it really does have a lot of metadata hidden
[00:38:11.140 --> 00:38:14.060]   and it does a lot of things that your favorite apps do.
[00:38:14.060 --> 00:38:15.260]   And it looks like an iPad app.
[00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:16.260]   It looks fantastic.
[00:38:16.260 --> 00:38:17.260]   I mean, it is the iPad app.
[00:38:17.260 --> 00:38:18.260]   Yeah.
[00:38:18.260 --> 00:38:19.260]   It's really interesting.
[00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:25.100]   Now, are they taking a chance by doing this that it would make Twitter so complicated
[00:38:25.100 --> 00:38:30.340]   that people will be scared off Twitter has traditionally been very simple, very straightforward.
[00:38:30.340 --> 00:38:34.300]   Kevin, do you think this is too complicated for normal people?
[00:38:34.300 --> 00:38:37.500]   What is the percentage of people who were using the website before?
[00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:42.100]   71% of all tweets come from the Twitter webpage.
[00:38:42.100 --> 00:38:43.100]   No, really.
[00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:44.740]   Yeah, huge majority.
[00:38:44.740 --> 00:38:45.740]   Yes.
[00:38:45.740 --> 00:38:47.740]   I know I was shocked too.
[00:38:47.740 --> 00:38:54.020]   Well, I imagine then for the supposed 71%, this will be, I don't think it's too complicated.
[00:38:54.020 --> 00:38:56.940]   I mean, it's just, it's the same old scroll on the left.
[00:38:56.940 --> 00:39:00.540]   It's just that there's now some stuff on the right if you, you know, want to address it.
[00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:01.540]   I guess you're right.
[00:39:01.540 --> 00:39:04.940]   I guess if you don't look at what's on the right, it looks like a way.
[00:39:04.940 --> 00:39:08.940]   If it's just for you a scan thing, if it's just, you know, checking in and checking out,
[00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:10.460]   then there's really no difference.
[00:39:10.460 --> 00:39:12.020]   But I like it a lot.
[00:39:12.020 --> 00:39:13.180]   I wish I had it in my own account.
[00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:14.820]   See, the reason I ask is we're geeks.
[00:39:14.820 --> 00:39:15.820]   We like it.
[00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:16.820]   We like complexity.
[00:39:16.820 --> 00:39:18.460]   We like more features, not fewer.
[00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:21.340]   We like more data, a lot less.
[00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:25.580]   And I think that Twitter has really succeeded by appealing to the MTV crowd.
[00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:26.580]   I don't know.
[00:39:26.580 --> 00:39:27.580]   Yeah.
[00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:32.460]   I don't want to be too disparaging, but it's appealed to a crowd that is not sophisticated.
[00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:36.620]   This, I mean, this definitely feels like a little bit of a turn in the different, different
[00:39:36.620 --> 00:39:37.620]   direction.
[00:39:37.620 --> 00:39:42.100]   This combined with the turning off basic authentication, which, which caused a lot of, a lot of ruffles
[00:39:42.100 --> 00:39:46.860]   people were saying, Hey, you know, I built my Twitter app because it was so easy to authenticate.
[00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:51.060]   And now you have to figure out OAuth, which, which involves a chain of back and forth.
[00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:53.980]   And there are a lot of one off Twitter apps that maybe would have never happened if they
[00:39:53.980 --> 00:39:57.740]   had launched with just OAuth, you know, Twitter was just so simple.
[00:39:57.740 --> 00:40:00.260]   And that's what it made it easy to develop on.
[00:40:00.260 --> 00:40:03.180]   And so, and I think this UI is also a little, a little more complicated.
[00:40:03.180 --> 00:40:05.740]   I don't know that it's too complicated, but it's definitely a little more complicated.
[00:40:05.740 --> 00:40:10.740]   They're definitely taking, taking a risk with their, their, their call, their, you know,
[00:40:10.740 --> 00:40:13.620]   the thing that made them famous, which was the total simplicity.
[00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:15.820]   I have to say, I like this a lot, though.
[00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:16.820]   Go ahead.
[00:40:16.820 --> 00:40:17.820]   Yeah.
[00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:21.900]   But Gina, we had this discussion around partner for saying to give a, but when Google drop
[00:40:21.900 --> 00:40:26.700]   wave, what did that do to developers?
[00:40:26.700 --> 00:40:30.860]   And when Twitter started its own client, what did that do to developers?
[00:40:30.860 --> 00:40:34.980]   You know, aren't we in the same boat here if you're a developer and you're choosing where
[00:40:34.980 --> 00:40:37.940]   to put your, your effort?
[00:40:37.940 --> 00:40:39.780]   And Twitter was made by developers.
[00:40:39.780 --> 00:40:42.780]   It was made by the fact that it was an API.
[00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:45.260]   Biz has said that often.
[00:40:45.260 --> 00:40:49.660]   Are they now thinking, well, we're now too big for, we don't need the developers anymore,
[00:40:49.660 --> 00:40:53.660]   or are there new opportunities because the API has more data?
[00:40:53.660 --> 00:40:56.780]   What's the relationship to developers that comes out of all this?
[00:40:56.780 --> 00:41:01.180]   I think, I think Twitter desperately wants developers to build something, anything other
[00:41:01.180 --> 00:41:02.180]   than a client.
[00:41:02.180 --> 00:41:04.940]   Even when I went to Hack Day, I talked to Doug at Twitter and he was just like, what
[00:41:04.940 --> 00:41:07.780]   can we do to get people to build, you know, developers to do something that's just more
[00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:09.660]   than, oh, hey, look, here's the data.
[00:41:09.660 --> 00:41:11.620]   You know, here's just another client.
[00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:14.540]   Um, so, and I think that's, you know, as a developer, you go to where the people are,
[00:41:14.540 --> 00:41:17.260]   you go to where you're interested and where the people are and you're interested in places
[00:41:17.260 --> 00:41:18.980]   where you can interact with your friends.
[00:41:18.980 --> 00:41:22.060]   And then, you know, after a while, I mean, I think there was, there was this golden age
[00:41:22.060 --> 00:41:26.540]   for Twitter apps where the Twitter website just could barely stay up, forget being functional,
[00:41:26.540 --> 00:41:29.420]   and that was the time when you wanted to make a really great rich client.
[00:41:29.420 --> 00:41:32.580]   But now it's, you know, it's a new time when you, you know, they just raised the bar, they're
[00:41:32.580 --> 00:41:37.340]   asking you to do more, you know, interesting, clever things, things that, that the site itself
[00:41:37.340 --> 00:41:38.340]   doesn't do.
[00:41:38.340 --> 00:41:43.740]   So for me, I just, I see it as kind of just, you know, more of a challenge.
[00:41:43.740 --> 00:41:44.740]   But it is disheartening.
[00:41:44.740 --> 00:41:48.460]   I mean, I think it's disheartening for a site like Brizzly or Tweetak or, you know, any,
[00:41:48.460 --> 00:41:52.740]   any client developer who, who's been, you know, working on their Twitter client for a long
[00:41:52.740 --> 00:41:55.100]   time and it does all the things now that the Twitter website does.
[00:41:55.100 --> 00:41:59.180]   And it gives, gives you users less of a reason to download your app.
[00:41:59.180 --> 00:42:03.140]   So it just forces developers to really market the thing that they do that differentiates
[00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:04.140]   them from the core service.
[00:42:04.140 --> 00:42:05.140]   I don't think that's a bad thing.
[00:42:05.140 --> 00:42:06.140]   I mean, I think that's-
[00:42:06.140 --> 00:42:09.340]   Well, for right now, it's not, it's only on the web, not mobile, right?
[00:42:09.340 --> 00:42:10.340]   Right.
[00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:11.340]   Right.
[00:42:11.340 --> 00:42:13.020]   You get the old UI if you go mobile.
[00:42:13.020 --> 00:42:16.900]   Mobile apps, unless you are in love with the Twitter app, which a lot of people are, but
[00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:22.500]   there are still lots of mobile apps that will have a kind of unique offering for Twitter.
[00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:23.500]   Mm-hmm.
[00:42:23.500 --> 00:42:24.500]   That's true.
[00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:25.500]   Yep.
[00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:26.500]   Yeah.
[00:42:26.500 --> 00:42:27.500]   By the way, I'm just-
[00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:28.500]   Go ahead.
[00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:29.500]   No, your turn.
[00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:30.500]   No.
[00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:31.500]   Sorry.
[00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:32.500]   I'm stupid.
[00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:35.500]   I can't find in this the recommendations, the people recommendations to me.
[00:42:35.500 --> 00:42:38.620]   I was trying to find who to follow too, and I couldn't.
[00:42:38.620 --> 00:42:41.340]   I thought they were on my page and then I accepted everybody.
[00:42:41.340 --> 00:42:43.860]   I said, "Oh, that's great, great, great, great, great."
[00:42:43.860 --> 00:42:44.860]   And now it's gone.
[00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:49.900]   Maybe it was when I first got it, it was over here in this empty space to the right of
[00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:50.900]   trends.
[00:42:50.900 --> 00:42:52.660]   Yeah, no, I think that they pulled it.
[00:42:52.660 --> 00:42:53.660]   Maybe they pulled it.
[00:42:53.660 --> 00:42:54.660]   They just pulled it.
[00:42:54.660 --> 00:42:55.660]   Yeah.
[00:42:55.660 --> 00:42:56.660]   I'm not seeing it either.
[00:42:56.660 --> 00:43:00.860]   You know, the who to follow was one of those things where I just was like, "Okay, don't
[00:43:00.860 --> 00:43:01.860]   show me.
[00:43:01.860 --> 00:43:04.540]   I wanted to say don't show me this person again," which is something that Facebook has that
[00:43:04.540 --> 00:43:05.540]   Twitter didn't have.
[00:43:05.540 --> 00:43:06.540]   Yes.
[00:43:06.540 --> 00:43:07.540]   Yes.
[00:43:07.540 --> 00:43:08.540]   Like, yeah, I know this person, they're kind of annoying.
[00:43:08.540 --> 00:43:09.540]   Don't show me.
[00:43:09.540 --> 00:43:10.540]   Yeah.
[00:43:10.540 --> 00:43:11.540]   Stop.
[00:43:11.540 --> 00:43:12.540]   There's a reason I'm not following him.
[00:43:12.540 --> 00:43:13.540]   Right.
[00:43:13.540 --> 00:43:17.060]   But imagine for a lot of the developers, it's kind of like the situation that a lot of news
[00:43:17.060 --> 00:43:22.380]   is in now where if you can get, if the Twitter website is good enough, as good as a standard,
[00:43:22.380 --> 00:43:27.620]   show me my friends, show me my replies client, then they have to come up with something that
[00:43:27.620 --> 00:43:32.980]   is unique and allow Twitter to do the basic stuff.
[00:43:32.980 --> 00:43:39.380]   You know, like Gina's ThinkUp, which is a really in-depth reply and user response tracking
[00:43:39.380 --> 00:43:40.380]   tool.
[00:43:40.380 --> 00:43:44.660]   I'm sure that we'll probably find some differentiated stuff, like maybe, you know, safe apps for
[00:43:44.660 --> 00:43:47.180]   kids, stuff like that.
[00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:48.180]   I would think.
[00:43:48.180 --> 00:43:51.340]   Now that Twitter is good enough for most people.
[00:43:51.340 --> 00:43:55.340]   It was really interesting because you saw this coming, you know, they started making
[00:43:55.340 --> 00:44:00.940]   noise and they used Fred Wilson to say, "Boy, if I were you, I wouldn't write any more third-party
[00:44:00.940 --> 00:44:01.940]   Twitter."
[00:44:01.940 --> 00:44:02.940]   Yes.
[00:44:02.940 --> 00:44:03.940]   Right.
[00:44:03.940 --> 00:44:04.940]   Right.
[00:44:04.940 --> 00:44:07.340]   It was really, you could see this all coming.
[00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:08.340]   Yes.
[00:44:08.340 --> 00:44:10.940]   And I, you know, I have to say, I think they handled this very well.
[00:44:10.940 --> 00:44:17.260]   I think Twitter might end up being a very good case study for how to do it right.
[00:44:17.260 --> 00:44:20.500]   They suffered badly with the fail well, but they hung in there.
[00:44:20.500 --> 00:44:25.700]   They obviously fixed those issues because they're handling huge amounts of traffic now.
[00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:29.060]   They kept the site simple when there was a lot of pressure to do otherwise, but they
[00:44:29.060 --> 00:44:35.020]   did add features as users kind of organically created them, like the ad symbol was not originally
[00:44:35.020 --> 00:44:36.020]   in Twitter.
[00:44:36.020 --> 00:44:41.020]   And I think that they've done everything very cleverly.
[00:44:41.020 --> 00:44:45.020]   And I have to say, this is impressive what they've done here.
[00:44:45.020 --> 00:44:46.020]   It is.
[00:44:46.020 --> 00:44:52.460]   If you go back, I saw, what I was in San Francisco once more for the book and not forgetting his
[00:44:52.460 --> 00:44:57.100]   heritage at Blogger, he went through really desperate fail well times then when the thing
[00:44:57.100 --> 00:44:58.900]   was just down all the time.
[00:44:58.900 --> 00:44:59.900]   It's quite famous.
[00:44:59.900 --> 00:45:00.900]   Yeah.
[00:45:00.900 --> 00:45:03.500]   And I joked that the server was in his kitchen.
[00:45:03.500 --> 00:45:08.100]   Well, no, it wasn't, but whatever the else was.
[00:45:08.100 --> 00:45:15.300]   And he had an incredible determination to show everybody and make it work.
[00:45:15.300 --> 00:45:19.500]   And you know, if you think about it, he shares that with Zuckerberg.
[00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:20.500]   Hmm.
[00:45:20.500 --> 00:45:22.300]   And he had a lot of experience with Blogger, right?
[00:45:22.300 --> 00:45:24.780]   I mean, this was his experience with Blogger back in the day too.
[00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:28.140]   I mean, there was some story he was, he said, I was sitting on my kitchen floor like I'd
[00:45:28.140 --> 00:45:29.140]   lost my whole company.
[00:45:29.140 --> 00:45:31.580]   I couldn't pay anyone, but I believed in this thing that I built.
[00:45:31.580 --> 00:45:34.260]   So, you know, when it turned out to be a huge deal.
[00:45:34.260 --> 00:45:39.500]   No, Ev is fantastic and he has good ideas and it's, it's, he did hang in there.
[00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:42.060]   And I was going to say earlier, one, one, one good thing.
[00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:45.340]   The other great thing that Twitter does is their developer relations are very good.
[00:45:45.340 --> 00:45:46.540]   Their developer support is very good.
[00:45:46.540 --> 00:45:47.940]   And they keep upgrading the API.
[00:45:47.940 --> 00:45:52.180]   Like they're just, they've just released the user streams API, which is push versus pull.
[00:45:52.180 --> 00:45:54.140]   So as a developer, you don't have to keep polling.
[00:45:54.140 --> 00:45:55.140]   It will notify you.
[00:45:55.140 --> 00:45:58.620]   So, so that's, you know, that's an exciting thing for a developer.
[00:45:58.620 --> 00:46:01.180]   You know, that's a kind of thing that you're like, Oh, okay, this gives me more possibilities
[00:46:01.180 --> 00:46:02.180]   for what I can do.
[00:46:02.180 --> 00:46:07.700]   But they are kind of trying to deprecate Pub/Sub Hubbub, aren't they?
[00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:08.700]   Yeah.
[00:46:08.700 --> 00:46:10.700]   There is an interesting word.
[00:46:10.700 --> 00:46:13.860]   I bookmarked the article if I can find it.
[00:46:13.860 --> 00:46:14.860]   That's, yeah, that is interesting.
[00:46:14.860 --> 00:46:18.420]   And there's a little anti Pub/Sub hubbub, fub, fub, fud.
[00:46:18.420 --> 00:46:25.860]   I hadn't, you know, I hadn't really thought about that, but that is, that is interesting.
[00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:35.700]   They implied that better to use our notification system than Pub/Sub hubbub, which is open.
[00:46:35.700 --> 00:46:38.260]   And they said something about it's not being deep.
[00:46:38.260 --> 00:46:41.020]   I thought I put a link in here and I don't see it, but.
[00:46:41.020 --> 00:46:42.020]   Wow.
[00:46:42.020 --> 00:46:43.020]   It's like breaking up with somebody.
[00:46:43.020 --> 00:46:44.020]   Yeah.
[00:46:44.020 --> 00:46:45.020]   Pub/Sub hubbub, fud.
[00:46:45.020 --> 00:46:50.460]   I think I have a show title.
[00:46:50.460 --> 00:46:51.460]   Let's see.
[00:46:51.460 --> 00:46:52.460]   What else is going on?
[00:46:52.460 --> 00:46:58.020]   There's a little kind of a little egg on the face here with its employee who was spying
[00:46:58.020 --> 00:46:59.020]   on.
[00:46:59.020 --> 00:47:00.020]   Oh, ouch.
[00:47:00.020 --> 00:47:01.020]   Ouch.
[00:47:01.020 --> 00:47:02.020]   Ouch.
[00:47:02.020 --> 00:47:05.980]   This is from Galker, but Google has confirmed that they have fired the fellow.
[00:47:05.980 --> 00:47:12.180]   A Google engineer spied on four underage teens for months before the company was notified
[00:47:12.180 --> 00:47:13.900]   of the abuse.
[00:47:13.900 --> 00:47:17.780]   David Barksdale, a 27 year old former Google engineer repeatedly took advantage of his
[00:47:17.780 --> 00:47:23.100]   position as a member of an elite technical group at the company to access users accounts
[00:47:23.100 --> 00:47:27.900]   violating the privacy of at least four miners during his employment.
[00:47:27.900 --> 00:47:32.340]   He met the kids through a technology group in the Seattle area while working as an SRE,
[00:47:32.340 --> 00:47:37.100]   a site reliability engineer in the Kirkland Washington office of Google.
[00:47:37.100 --> 00:47:41.700]   He was fired according to Google in July after his actions were reported to the company.
[00:47:41.700 --> 00:47:47.700]   Google says, look, SREs have to be, we have to have some engineers that can access data.
[00:47:47.700 --> 00:47:50.780]   It's just a requirement.
[00:47:50.780 --> 00:47:54.300]   This is a dirty little secret of every single big web company.
[00:47:54.300 --> 00:47:57.660]   The fact is that there are engineers who can access the production database and sometimes
[00:47:57.660 --> 00:48:00.340]   they're going to do it for not good enough reasons.
[00:48:00.340 --> 00:48:02.060]   I think that this happens a lot.
[00:48:02.060 --> 00:48:04.620]   A lot of times it never gets caught.
[00:48:04.620 --> 00:48:08.380]   I think that Google handled it the way they needed to handle it.
[00:48:08.380 --> 00:48:13.860]   It does definitely emphasize the requirement that you've got to have these people, they
[00:48:13.860 --> 00:48:15.460]   have to be highly trusted.
[00:48:15.460 --> 00:48:17.860]   They have to earn credentials in order to have access to this data.
[00:48:17.860 --> 00:48:18.860]   I think it happens a lot.
[00:48:18.860 --> 00:48:23.380]   It wasn't their story about Facebook where an engineer was quoted as saying, hey, what
[00:48:23.380 --> 00:48:24.620]   do you want to know about who?
[00:48:24.620 --> 00:48:29.020]   I'll just look them up in the production database right now.
[00:48:29.020 --> 00:48:33.420]   The fact is that when you're developing a web application, at least back in the day
[00:48:33.420 --> 00:48:37.740]   when I had my full-time programming job, we pull down data from the production database
[00:48:37.740 --> 00:48:40.580]   into the stadium database just to test things.
[00:48:40.580 --> 00:48:45.100]   You see things that private messages or whatever that when you're like, oh, yeah.
[00:48:45.100 --> 00:48:47.100]   You just got to be really strong procedures in place to--
[00:48:47.100 --> 00:48:50.420]   Is there any way to track that or any way to team up?
[00:48:50.420 --> 00:48:56.140]   If you're Google now and say we've got to do something to not let this happen again,
[00:48:56.140 --> 00:48:57.980]   what is that?
[00:48:57.980 --> 00:49:00.860]   You just got to have really robust procedures in place.
[00:49:00.860 --> 00:49:05.140]   Any time an SRE or a site-related person, somebody with the right credentials does access
[00:49:05.140 --> 00:49:10.100]   the production database, live database of sensitive data.
[00:49:10.100 --> 00:49:11.100]   They've got to log that.
[00:49:11.100 --> 00:49:12.260]   They've got to justify it.
[00:49:12.260 --> 00:49:13.780]   They've got to have a reason.
[00:49:13.780 --> 00:49:17.540]   But the reality is, when an operation like Google, it's so many engineers and so many
[00:49:17.540 --> 00:49:23.860]   servers and dealing with problems, that's a big-- it's a lot of hoops to have an engineer
[00:49:23.860 --> 00:49:28.540]   jump through just to check on whether or not someone's Google chat is working or why
[00:49:28.540 --> 00:49:31.660]   a group of users, the service is down.
[00:49:31.660 --> 00:49:33.220]   But I do think it's possible.
[00:49:33.220 --> 00:49:38.060]   I think the stories like this are definitely a reason to do that.
[00:49:38.060 --> 00:49:42.860]   The raw who done it involves looking up a call on Google Voice, looking up an IM on Google
[00:49:42.860 --> 00:49:46.780]   Talk, going through a Gmail contact list.
[00:49:46.780 --> 00:49:50.100]   It's pretty much the Tinfoil hat for Gates' worst nightmare.
[00:49:50.100 --> 00:49:54.020]   It's only one engineers out of 20,000 employees, right?
[00:49:54.020 --> 00:49:55.500]   But still--
[00:49:55.500 --> 00:50:02.220]   Google's response from Bill Cogren, who was a senior vice president engineering Google,
[00:50:02.220 --> 00:50:08.340]   quote, "We dismissed David Barksdale for breaking Google's strict internal privacy policies.
[00:50:08.340 --> 00:50:13.340]   We carefully control the number of employees who have access to our systems and we regularly
[00:50:13.340 --> 00:50:15.060]   upgrade our security controls.
[00:50:15.060 --> 00:50:19.420]   For example, we are significantly increasing the amount of time we spend auditing our
[00:50:19.420 --> 00:50:22.660]   logs to ensure those controls are effective.
[00:50:22.660 --> 00:50:27.020]   That said, a limited number of people will always need to access these systems if we
[00:50:27.020 --> 00:50:31.300]   are to operate them properly, which is why we take any breach so seriously."
[00:50:31.300 --> 00:50:33.620]   I mean, there's nothing they can do about this.
[00:50:33.620 --> 00:50:34.620]   These things--
[00:50:34.620 --> 00:50:39.060]   You need a team that you need two people on a 20 system, a 20 system.
[00:50:39.060 --> 00:50:43.700]   And you have to use systems that check to see, is there an employee who's regularly
[00:50:43.700 --> 00:50:49.180]   accessing-- that basically analyze the activity and see if there's anything improper going
[00:50:49.180 --> 00:50:50.180]   on.
[00:50:50.180 --> 00:50:54.380]   If this one engineer was accessing these four teams data over the course of four months,
[00:50:54.380 --> 00:50:56.340]   that seems like unusual behavior to me.
[00:50:56.340 --> 00:50:59.740]   And listen, if any company is going to do it, Google's going to do it.
[00:50:59.740 --> 00:51:05.580]   They've got incredible systems set up for developers to work on projects.
[00:51:05.580 --> 00:51:08.300]   And I imagine that their security has to be super, super high.
[00:51:08.300 --> 00:51:09.820]   It's torture for me.
[00:51:09.820 --> 00:51:10.820]   Kevin, you're right.
[00:51:10.820 --> 00:51:17.340]   I just got back from Berlin, where they're nutty about Street View.
[00:51:17.340 --> 00:51:21.460]   And they still bring up the data collection on the Wi-Fi, which of course is absolutely
[00:51:21.460 --> 00:51:22.460]   stupid.
[00:51:22.460 --> 00:51:24.660]   And they f'd up and allowed somebody to do that.
[00:51:24.660 --> 00:51:25.660]   And they should have done it.
[00:51:25.660 --> 00:51:28.500]   But it had no commercial value.
[00:51:28.500 --> 00:51:30.980]   That's just paranoia talking.
[00:51:30.980 --> 00:51:32.580]   This is the real fear.
[00:51:32.580 --> 00:51:36.500]   This is that we all trust our stuff there.
[00:51:36.500 --> 00:51:38.420]   And Google could lose business this way.
[00:51:38.420 --> 00:51:42.740]   Companies could say, somebody could find sensitive financial information.
[00:51:42.740 --> 00:51:47.660]   Well, Kevin Midnick, the famous hacker, always said that the weakest element in any security
[00:51:47.660 --> 00:51:49.260]   system is always the human one.
[00:51:49.260 --> 00:51:55.460]   So if you've got-- with those good filters that Gina mentioned in place, yeah, you can
[00:51:55.460 --> 00:51:57.220]   notice that someone's doing something.
[00:51:57.220 --> 00:52:01.460]   It's the people you hire that have to be calder enough not to do it.
[00:52:01.460 --> 00:52:02.460]   The other--
[00:52:02.460 --> 00:52:04.180]   Well, you're always chasing-- it's like spam, isn't it, Kevin?
[00:52:04.180 --> 00:52:09.260]   You're always chasing the bad guys that they will outsmart the filter you have.
[00:52:09.260 --> 00:52:10.260]   Yeah.
[00:52:10.260 --> 00:52:12.820]   The other amazing thing is that a 15-year-old uses Google Voice.
[00:52:12.820 --> 00:52:16.660]   I mean, can you imagine the raw volume of data you create if you're a Google Voice user
[00:52:16.660 --> 00:52:19.220]   and you're like 15 or 16 and you have social life?
[00:52:19.220 --> 00:52:21.660]   I don't use Google Voice Kids.
[00:52:21.660 --> 00:52:25.540]   Well, what it means is my kids don't talk on the phone.
[00:52:25.540 --> 00:52:26.540]   They never talk.
[00:52:26.540 --> 00:52:27.540]   They never talk on the phone.
[00:52:27.540 --> 00:52:31.420]   No, but if you're using the SMS service through Google Voice, I mean, my God.
[00:52:31.420 --> 00:52:32.420]   Free texts.
[00:52:32.420 --> 00:52:33.420]   Free texts, yeah.
[00:52:33.420 --> 00:52:34.420]   Right.
[00:52:34.420 --> 00:52:37.260]   These are obviously sophisticated teens because my kids haven't figured that out.
[00:52:37.260 --> 00:52:42.700]   But somebody sophisticated knows that, oh, yeah, we just use the Google Voice.
[00:52:42.700 --> 00:52:43.700]   Wow.
[00:52:43.700 --> 00:52:48.460]   All right, let's get to our tools and our tips and our numbers of the week.
[00:52:48.460 --> 00:52:52.660]   But before that, we got to figure out a way that we can all, even though we're in New
[00:52:52.660 --> 00:52:59.940]   York, San Francisco, San Diego, Go-See, the Facebook movie on October 1st, we've got
[00:52:59.940 --> 00:53:03.900]   to figure out some way we could all see this together.
[00:53:03.900 --> 00:53:04.900]   What are we going to do?
[00:53:04.900 --> 00:53:07.540]   Should we create a Google wave?
[00:53:07.540 --> 00:53:11.100]   Oh, can you stream a screening?
[00:53:11.100 --> 00:53:13.860]   But just to us, Leo.
[00:53:13.860 --> 00:53:15.820]   There's got to be some way we could do this.
[00:53:15.820 --> 00:53:18.420]   We must be around on October 1st.
[00:53:18.420 --> 00:53:20.340]   Well, yeah, that's true.
[00:53:20.340 --> 00:53:22.900]   Or we could just have our chat room.
[00:53:22.900 --> 00:53:26.660]   Everybody bring your chat to the theater.
[00:53:26.660 --> 00:53:28.740]   There you go.
[00:53:28.740 --> 00:53:31.740]   And we'll have a, and we'll just broadcast the chat.
[00:53:31.740 --> 00:53:33.220]   We could just, we just make fun of it.
[00:53:33.220 --> 00:53:34.220]   Like just the whole time.
[00:53:34.220 --> 00:53:35.220]   Just walk in the whole time.
[00:53:35.220 --> 00:53:38.260]   It'll be a lot, well, live logging, but live chatting.
[00:53:38.260 --> 00:53:39.260]   Can you do that?
[00:53:39.260 --> 00:53:42.300]   I think you, I know in my theater, you have to turn everything off.
[00:53:42.300 --> 00:53:44.020]   But, but I guess we could chat.
[00:53:44.020 --> 00:53:45.020]   Could we chat?
[00:53:45.020 --> 00:53:46.020]   Look, he's typing dramatically.
[00:53:46.020 --> 00:53:47.020]   [laughter]
[00:53:47.020 --> 00:53:52.060]   Yeah, we could have so much fun.
[00:53:52.060 --> 00:53:55.420]   I'm going to a screening of Catfish tonight, which I hadn't heard about, but apparently
[00:53:55.420 --> 00:53:58.260]   it's a documentary about an online relationship, Gonna Lie.
[00:53:58.260 --> 00:53:59.620]   I will let you know how it goes.
[00:53:59.620 --> 00:54:00.860]   That never happens.
[00:54:00.860 --> 00:54:01.860]   Yeah.
[00:54:01.860 --> 00:54:02.860]   [laughter]
[00:54:02.860 --> 00:54:08.260]   All right, Eileen, our new producer, is, I am charging you with figuring out a way that
[00:54:08.260 --> 00:54:12.780]   every single person who watches this show and listens to this show can join me, Jeff,
[00:54:12.780 --> 00:54:17.540]   Gina, Kevin, and anybody else who wants to watching October 1st, we all have to go
[00:54:17.540 --> 00:54:20.740]   to the first screening.
[00:54:20.740 --> 00:54:23.500]   We'll download the torrents and we'll broadcast it on Twitter.
[00:54:23.500 --> 00:54:24.500]   That's what we'll do.
[00:54:24.500 --> 00:54:25.500]   It'll stop though.
[00:54:25.500 --> 00:54:26.980]   Welcome to the job, Eileen.
[00:54:26.980 --> 00:54:27.980]   [laughter]
[00:54:27.980 --> 00:54:33.140]   This is what Gary Dilibate feels like.
[00:54:33.140 --> 00:54:34.140]   [laughter]
[00:54:34.140 --> 00:54:35.140]   For Gary.
[00:54:35.140 --> 00:54:38.900]   Baba boy to you all.
[00:54:38.900 --> 00:54:42.260]   Gina, your tip of the week.
[00:54:42.260 --> 00:54:44.220]   Kevin, do you have something?
[00:54:44.220 --> 00:54:45.220]   I do.
[00:54:45.220 --> 00:54:46.220]   I do.
[00:54:46.220 --> 00:54:49.100]   Kevin, your tip of the week.
[00:54:49.100 --> 00:54:53.540]   In the complete Android guide, which you should be following, and I'll tell you why
[00:54:53.540 --> 00:54:55.940]   in just a little bit.
[00:54:55.940 --> 00:55:01.260]   I have a section in the tutorials with annoyance fixes.
[00:55:01.260 --> 00:55:04.340]   One of the annoyances that I've always heard from people is this one application crashes
[00:55:04.340 --> 00:55:06.900]   every single time.
[00:55:06.900 --> 00:55:13.100]   I came up with what is the, I guess it's the Holy Trinity plus an atomic fourth option
[00:55:13.100 --> 00:55:19.660]   for fixing apps that are crashing on you all the time without using a third party app
[00:55:19.660 --> 00:55:20.660]   or anything.
[00:55:20.660 --> 00:55:23.740]   In the, Leo has his phone there if you want to follow along.
[00:55:23.740 --> 00:55:24.740]   Okay.
[00:55:24.740 --> 00:55:31.540]   On the JoyDexia menu, if it's up to Froyo, but I guess it wouldn't be, maybe.
[00:55:31.540 --> 00:55:34.500]   Okay, I have to put up my thing on the screen.
[00:55:34.500 --> 00:55:36.500]   Okay, let me log in.
[00:55:36.500 --> 00:55:38.580]   So, you go to a menu, all right.
[00:55:38.580 --> 00:55:40.540]   Menu, and then settings.
[00:55:40.540 --> 00:55:42.900]   Settings, okay, following along at home.
[00:55:42.900 --> 00:55:43.900]   Under applications.
[00:55:43.900 --> 00:55:45.900]   Yeah, which I use a lot.
[00:55:45.900 --> 00:55:46.900]   Okay.
[00:55:46.900 --> 00:55:48.900]   And then manage applications.
[00:55:48.900 --> 00:55:49.900]   All right.
[00:55:49.900 --> 00:55:50.900]   You know, I use that so much.
[00:55:50.900 --> 00:55:54.100]   I actually have a shortcut on the desktop that brings you right to the page.
[00:55:54.100 --> 00:55:58.260]   Which you can do by holding down on the home screen and choosing shortcuts.
[00:55:58.260 --> 00:55:59.260]   That's one of you.
[00:55:59.260 --> 00:56:02.500]   I have to say that's a really nice feature that Android has over the iPhones.
[00:56:02.500 --> 00:56:03.500]   Yes.
[00:56:03.500 --> 00:56:06.260]   You can go to any page in the settings right from the desktop.
[00:56:06.260 --> 00:56:09.300]   Now, I'm not sure how it looks different on your screen in mind, but under the all section.
[00:56:09.300 --> 00:56:11.700]   Yeah, this is the Moto Blur Crip Crap.
[00:56:11.700 --> 00:56:12.700]   Yeah.
[00:56:12.700 --> 00:56:16.580]   Well, under a phone running Froyo, you should have an all section and you can click on an
[00:56:16.580 --> 00:56:18.220]   app, any app like.
[00:56:18.220 --> 00:56:19.980]   Let me open the menu.
[00:56:19.980 --> 00:56:22.140]   Because I think the menu.
[00:56:22.140 --> 00:56:25.020]   Google Voice in my case, which is I sometimes have some problems.
[00:56:25.020 --> 00:56:28.740]   So I have a sort by size or filter and I should just not filter.
[00:56:28.740 --> 00:56:29.740]   I should say all.
[00:56:29.740 --> 00:56:30.740]   Okay.
[00:56:30.740 --> 00:56:31.740]   Now I have all.
[00:56:31.740 --> 00:56:32.740]   There's everything.
[00:56:32.740 --> 00:56:33.740]   Now, what do I want to do now?
[00:56:33.740 --> 00:56:35.780]   Let's pick a pick an app that's wonky.
[00:56:35.780 --> 00:56:37.500]   For me, it might crash a lot.
[00:56:37.500 --> 00:56:38.980]   I'll just say it's a lifetime.
[00:56:38.980 --> 00:56:41.300]   Yeah, just click it.
[00:56:41.300 --> 00:56:45.940]   And then so it's laid out differently, but there are three options that you want to go
[00:56:45.940 --> 00:56:46.980]   through usually.
[00:56:46.980 --> 00:56:49.420]   The first one is for stop.
[00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:54.180]   And that usually if an app is crashing on you right now, that's the first step and that'll
[00:56:54.180 --> 00:56:59.580]   kill it and cause it, at least, rejigger itself.
[00:56:59.580 --> 00:57:01.540]   And sometimes that works.
[00:57:01.540 --> 00:57:06.700]   The next step is to clear the cache of the app if it's there, if it's available.
[00:57:06.700 --> 00:57:10.020]   That clears out the temporary data that an app might be holding.
[00:57:10.020 --> 00:57:14.700]   And sometimes if bad data gets in there, the Twitter app for me that happens all the time,
[00:57:14.700 --> 00:57:17.820]   you know, it might be causing you not to be able to sync or go on.
[00:57:17.820 --> 00:57:21.100]   The third option is clear data.
[00:57:21.100 --> 00:57:25.420]   And that actually wipes out all the data that's storing on your phone.
[00:57:25.420 --> 00:57:31.100]   So you might have to re-log into certain apps like Twitter clients or the voice.
[00:57:31.100 --> 00:57:35.340]   And that usually by that time, if you re-launch the app, everything's going to be working.
[00:57:35.340 --> 00:57:38.820]   And then I see atomic fourth option is uninstall.
[00:57:38.820 --> 00:57:41.100]   And you usually don't want to have to do that.
[00:57:41.100 --> 00:57:42.780]   That often doesn't fix things.
[00:57:42.780 --> 00:57:44.980]   You might just have to wait for the developer to update the app.
[00:57:44.980 --> 00:57:50.860]   But that's the Holy Trinity plus the atomic fourth for diagnosing problems with apps on
[00:57:50.860 --> 00:57:51.860]   Android.
[00:57:51.860 --> 00:57:55.060]   For stop, clear cache, clear data, or uninstall.
[00:57:55.060 --> 00:57:56.060]   Excellent.
[00:57:56.060 --> 00:57:58.620]   Kevin, I'm finding apps now.
[00:57:58.620 --> 00:58:03.980]   It's like the old abandoned ghost town of websites.
[00:58:03.980 --> 00:58:05.580]   I'm now finding ghost town apps.
[00:58:05.580 --> 00:58:06.580]   Oh, yeah.
[00:58:06.580 --> 00:58:07.580]   There's a lot of them.
[00:58:07.580 --> 00:58:09.860]   So for example, released and not updated.
[00:58:09.860 --> 00:58:10.860]   Yep.
[00:58:10.860 --> 00:58:11.860]   Yeah.
[00:58:11.860 --> 00:58:14.340]   So for example, the path train in New Jersey, I was looking at the schedule of a day to
[00:58:14.340 --> 00:58:16.620]   make sure I got here on time.
[00:58:16.620 --> 00:58:21.340]   And I have an app and it hasn't been filled in and God knows how long.
[00:58:21.340 --> 00:58:23.940]   And there's no way that there's no way to kind of check activity.
[00:58:23.940 --> 00:58:25.820]   When was the app last touched?
[00:58:25.820 --> 00:58:28.220]   Or what's the current status or anything like that?
[00:58:28.220 --> 00:58:32.860]   I would love to have some structure to be able to look at the currency of an app.
[00:58:32.860 --> 00:58:37.460]   And all the more irritating is if I pay for an app and then they go ghost down.
[00:58:37.460 --> 00:58:38.460]   That's a.
[00:58:38.460 --> 00:58:42.620]   As Jean and I can tell you, it's really frustrating with like say Firefox add-ons when someone
[00:58:42.620 --> 00:58:45.940]   has a brilliant overnight app and then they never touch it again.
[00:58:45.940 --> 00:58:46.940]   Right.
[00:58:46.940 --> 00:58:50.940]   Like a brilliant Firefox add-on that just doesn't get touched again, doesn't get updated.
[00:58:50.940 --> 00:58:52.460]   And you're like, oh, come on.
[00:58:52.460 --> 00:58:53.460]   This was so great.
[00:58:53.460 --> 00:58:55.420]   And you just don't have the long term love.
[00:58:55.420 --> 00:58:58.180]   Like, are you saying something about my business?
[00:58:58.180 --> 00:58:59.180]   Firefox.
[00:58:59.180 --> 00:59:00.180]   No, you're.
[00:59:00.180 --> 00:59:07.340]   No, I'm saying you would see and we post to an app on life hacker and it would look great.
[00:59:07.340 --> 00:59:09.900]   And the comments start off with everyone saying, this is amazing.
[00:59:09.900 --> 00:59:13.340]   And then you look at the post three months later and the comments have turned into this
[00:59:13.340 --> 00:59:14.340]   is total crap.
[00:59:14.340 --> 00:59:15.340]   Yeah.
[00:59:15.340 --> 00:59:16.340]   Haterfest.
[00:59:16.340 --> 00:59:17.340]   Yeah.
[00:59:17.340 --> 00:59:18.340]   Yeah.
[00:59:18.340 --> 00:59:21.380]   It reminds me I got to update my Firefox extension better Gmail better better better everything
[00:59:21.380 --> 00:59:22.380]   better life.
[00:59:22.380 --> 00:59:23.380]   Yeah.
[00:59:23.380 --> 00:59:25.380]   I'll mention them when they're up when they're actually up to date.
[00:59:25.380 --> 00:59:26.380]   Oh, yeah.
[00:59:26.380 --> 00:59:27.380]   I shouldn't have said the name.
[00:59:27.380 --> 00:59:28.380]   I mentioned it.
[00:59:28.380 --> 00:59:32.260]   No, but that, but you know, there is the maybe a disadvantage to having a low bar to entry
[00:59:32.260 --> 00:59:34.980]   is that anybody can write an app and put it in the marketplace.
[00:59:34.980 --> 00:59:39.260]   And so a lot of, I write, I used to write apps all the time that I would just write as
[00:59:39.260 --> 00:59:41.780]   a one off and I'm not going to, I don't want to maintain it.
[00:59:41.780 --> 00:59:44.460]   But if it's easy to put in the marketplace, of course, it's going to get there very quickly.
[00:59:44.460 --> 00:59:51.300]   If you didn't pay $99 and have to go through Apple's draconian approval process.
[00:59:51.300 --> 00:59:52.300]   Very good.
[00:59:52.300 --> 00:59:53.500]   So Gina, are you off the hook now?
[00:59:53.500 --> 00:59:54.500]   I guess you are.
[00:59:54.500 --> 00:59:56.340]   I'm glad myself off the hook.
[00:59:56.340 --> 00:59:57.340]   I had a tip it fell through.
[00:59:57.340 --> 00:59:58.340]   Oh, yeah.
[00:59:58.340 --> 01:00:03.100]   Before the break, we were saying before the show started, you're saying, oh, that's too
[01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:04.100]   bad.
[01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:05.820]   I got a little something, but it's not working quite the way I expected.
[01:00:05.820 --> 01:00:07.060]   So I'm not going to say what it is.
[01:00:07.060 --> 01:00:08.060]   Okay.
[01:00:08.060 --> 01:00:11.180]   Well, in that case, we go to Jeffrey Jarvis and his number of the week.
[01:00:11.180 --> 01:00:13.540]   I just found a new one here.
[01:00:13.540 --> 01:00:17.900]   Someone from Twitter sent in one that was very nice that, and I can't find their name
[01:00:17.900 --> 01:00:19.660]   right now and I apologize wherever you are.
[01:00:19.660 --> 01:00:20.980]   Thank you very much.
[01:00:20.980 --> 01:00:27.460]   But on the Google voice, I'm sorry, at Google mobile blog, they said that they're up to
[01:00:27.460 --> 01:00:32.700]   on Android, one quarter of the searches on Android, our voice.
[01:00:32.700 --> 01:00:33.700]   Wow.
[01:00:33.700 --> 01:00:34.700]   Nice.
[01:00:34.700 --> 01:00:35.700]   Wow.
[01:00:35.700 --> 01:00:36.700]   Isn't that amazing?
[01:00:36.700 --> 01:00:37.700]   Is that now?
[01:00:37.700 --> 01:00:38.700]   I guess you don't have to have Froyo to do voice.
[01:00:38.700 --> 01:00:39.700]   No, no, not at all.
[01:00:39.700 --> 01:00:40.700]   Yeah.
[01:00:40.700 --> 01:00:41.700]   No, the basic Google search.
[01:00:41.700 --> 01:00:42.700]   Right.
[01:00:42.700 --> 01:00:43.700]   Right.
[01:00:43.700 --> 01:00:44.700]   Right.
[01:00:44.700 --> 01:00:45.700]   Right.
[01:00:45.700 --> 01:00:48.380]   Whenever I do think to use it, it's incredible.
[01:00:48.380 --> 01:00:49.580]   I forget once in a while.
[01:00:49.580 --> 01:00:50.580]   Oh, yeah.
[01:00:50.580 --> 01:00:52.540]   It really does work amazingly well.
[01:00:52.540 --> 01:00:56.620]   I don't care if people look at me like I'm a nut.
[01:00:56.620 --> 01:00:58.780]   That's the sign it works.
[01:00:58.780 --> 01:00:59.780]   And then I just saw it.
[01:00:59.780 --> 01:01:06.500]   In other words, Chris Hughes, of course, X Facebook, just put up a story from CNN saying
[01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:10.660]   that candidates with more Facebook fans, one big on Tuesday.
[01:01:10.660 --> 01:01:11.660]   Huh?
[01:01:11.660 --> 01:01:13.060]   Which is coming.
[01:01:13.060 --> 01:01:16.660]   Is Facebook the way to predict election results?
[01:01:16.660 --> 01:01:21.420]   Who knows the, uh, now I'm going to embarrass myself terribly.
[01:01:21.420 --> 01:01:23.260]   I'm going to fail the current events quiz.
[01:01:23.260 --> 01:01:31.500]   A former head of Pakistan who is, um, um, exiled to London right now.
[01:01:31.500 --> 01:01:32.500]   I'm, um, Mushar.
[01:01:32.500 --> 01:01:33.500]   Moshar.
[01:01:33.500 --> 01:01:34.500]   Mushar.
[01:01:34.500 --> 01:01:39.380]   Uh, my, my colleague, son, Deep Joonarkar at CUNY just told me today that, that he announced
[01:01:39.380 --> 01:01:43.780]   that he's going to, uh, plan to come back to Pakistan and his justification for doing so
[01:01:43.780 --> 01:01:47.300]   was because the people want it and how does he know that because of all of his Facebook
[01:01:47.300 --> 01:01:48.300]   friends.
[01:01:48.300 --> 01:01:53.620]   And this is why I'm back on Facebook, ladies and gentlemen, because I would like to return
[01:01:53.620 --> 01:01:55.100]   from exile as well.
[01:01:55.100 --> 01:02:00.380]   Does my feet, has he done any, has he done any sort of Facebook friend to election results?
[01:02:00.380 --> 01:02:01.380]   He should.
[01:02:01.380 --> 01:02:04.580]   This would be a meet for the grist for the mill at 538.com.
[01:02:04.580 --> 01:02:05.580]   It really would be.
[01:02:05.580 --> 01:02:06.580]   Yeah.
[01:02:06.580 --> 01:02:07.580]   It's, it's, it's really quite great.
[01:02:07.580 --> 01:02:11.780]   So, so the story on CNN, which I'll put up on the, uh, on the, uh, the delicious feed
[01:02:11.780 --> 01:02:12.780]   momentarily.
[01:02:12.780 --> 01:02:17.300]   Um, it's kind of interesting that you, you, you, it gives you a new data point to check
[01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:18.300]   on.
[01:02:18.300 --> 01:02:22.780]   And you know, during, during the last presidential election, it was true that those who were more
[01:02:22.780 --> 01:02:25.500]   involved on the internet made more money on the internet.
[01:02:25.500 --> 01:02:27.300]   It's straightforward as could be.
[01:02:27.300 --> 01:02:28.300]   Yeah.
[01:02:28.300 --> 01:02:32.780]   Rudy Giuliani, my favorite thing about the campaign last time was Rudy Giuliani's, um, my space
[01:02:32.780 --> 01:02:35.700]   page until the very end of the campaign was private.
[01:02:35.700 --> 01:02:38.500]   Well, now that's just moronic.
[01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:39.500]   Isn't it?
[01:02:39.500 --> 01:02:40.980]   Isn't it magnificently ironic?
[01:02:40.980 --> 01:02:41.980]   I love it.
[01:02:41.980 --> 01:02:43.980]   I wouldn't vote for him just for that.
[01:02:43.980 --> 01:02:44.980]   Yes.
[01:02:44.980 --> 01:02:45.980]   Seriously.
[01:02:45.980 --> 01:02:46.980]   That's amazing.
[01:02:46.980 --> 01:02:47.980]   Geez.
[01:02:47.980 --> 01:02:50.980]   Oh, I don't want anybody to see anything about me.
[01:02:50.980 --> 01:02:53.540]   It would be terrible.
[01:02:53.540 --> 01:02:58.340]   So my tip is something that, uh, I, I also found on, uh, probably on Twitter or somewhere,
[01:02:58.340 --> 01:02:59.340]   probably life hacker.
[01:02:59.340 --> 01:03:00.340]   I don't know.
[01:03:00.340 --> 01:03:02.140]   I steal stuff right and left.
[01:03:02.140 --> 01:03:04.020]   It's a website called unsubscribe.
[01:03:04.020 --> 01:03:07.740]   If you guys seen this, oh, this is sounds like heaven to me.
[01:03:07.740 --> 01:03:08.740]   It is heaven.
[01:03:08.740 --> 01:03:10.420]   I'm in heaven.
[01:03:10.420 --> 01:03:14.580]   So, uh, I don't know about you, but my, and I, I tell you what, moving to Gmail and seeing
[01:03:14.580 --> 01:03:19.540]   the priority inbox really brought this home more than three quarters, probably 80% of
[01:03:19.540 --> 01:03:20.860]   all my mail is bacon.
[01:03:20.860 --> 01:03:26.180]   That is not exactly spam, but informational email usually lists I subscribe to and things
[01:03:26.180 --> 01:03:27.340]   like that.
[01:03:27.340 --> 01:03:29.660]   So I got to switch over here.
[01:03:29.660 --> 01:03:35.660]   Unsubscribe.com is a free service that you also have a paid version that will unsubscribe
[01:03:35.660 --> 01:03:41.420]   you from any mailing list and they have plugins for Yahoo mail, Gmail, Hotmail, and
[01:03:41.420 --> 01:03:42.420]   well mail.
[01:03:42.420 --> 01:03:46.540]   So, and now you get five unsubscribes a month for free.
[01:03:46.540 --> 01:03:48.540]   I immediately paid the $19.
[01:03:48.540 --> 01:03:51.060]   I'm paying for this because watch this.
[01:03:51.060 --> 01:03:57.060]   There's a now is a button when you install the plugin right there on your Gmail right
[01:03:57.060 --> 01:03:58.060]   next to.
[01:03:58.060 --> 01:04:02.900]   So, and, and if you look at, you know, if you look at my mail, a lot of it is like this.
[01:04:02.900 --> 01:04:05.100]   You know, at some point I, I went to this website.
[01:04:05.100 --> 01:04:10.260]   I bought something and now I just press the unsubscribe button and they're going to unsubscribe
[01:04:10.260 --> 01:04:11.260]   mainly.
[01:04:11.260 --> 01:04:16.300]   They put it at the top of the window that you're unsubscribed and then you can move on.
[01:04:16.300 --> 01:04:17.300]   Let's see.
[01:04:17.300 --> 01:04:18.300]   IT world wrap up.
[01:04:18.300 --> 01:04:19.300]   Yeah, there's another one.
[01:04:19.300 --> 01:04:23.100]   I've been just been filling up my inbox unsubscribing and unsubscribed.
[01:04:23.100 --> 01:04:29.660]   And then if you go back to unsubscribe.com, I'll log in here and it shows you all of the
[01:04:29.660 --> 01:04:31.820]   unsubscriptions attempts it's made.
[01:04:31.820 --> 01:04:40.220]   It gives you also a regular email digest and you can see how effective it has been.
[01:04:40.220 --> 01:04:41.540]   And it's, it's quite effective.
[01:04:41.540 --> 01:04:43.060]   I mean, it, it really works.
[01:04:43.060 --> 01:04:44.060]   I have to say.
[01:04:44.060 --> 01:04:48.140]   I don't know what kind of, you know, a lot of times there's a unsubscribe link at the
[01:04:48.140 --> 01:04:50.300]   bottom and you could do this by hand.
[01:04:50.300 --> 01:04:54.140]   They're obviously doing more than just that.
[01:04:54.140 --> 01:04:57.020]   It's safe on subscribe has a fair number of them.
[01:04:57.020 --> 01:05:00.780]   But the service that I obviously want from them is tell me all that you know, of your,
[01:05:00.780 --> 01:05:04.100]   of your customers who have me subscribed and let me get the hell off of them.
[01:05:04.100 --> 01:05:08.580]   But of course they don't do that because their customer is the spammer.
[01:05:08.580 --> 01:05:09.580]   Right.
[01:05:09.580 --> 01:05:10.580]   Yeah.
[01:05:10.580 --> 01:05:11.580]   That would be too user friendly, Jeff.
[01:05:11.580 --> 01:05:12.580]   Right.
[01:05:12.580 --> 01:05:13.580]   Yeah, the nice spammer.
[01:05:13.580 --> 01:05:18.620]   These aren't spammer spammers that people who, who put me on a list, which in some cases
[01:05:18.620 --> 01:05:20.700]   might almost be relevant, but it isn't.
[01:05:20.700 --> 01:05:21.700]   I didn't ask for this.
[01:05:21.700 --> 01:05:22.700]   Well, that's the thing.
[01:05:22.700 --> 01:05:26.620]   A lot of times I feel bad because I kind of, well, yeah, at some point I probably said,
[01:05:26.620 --> 01:05:27.620]   okay, but.
[01:05:27.620 --> 01:05:29.380]   Well, you're nice than I am.
[01:05:29.380 --> 01:05:31.380]   I never did, but even so.
[01:05:31.380 --> 01:05:33.020]   I don't want it.
[01:05:33.020 --> 01:05:36.540]   So I can't, I'm trying to find and I guess I might have deleted the, the, the digest I
[01:05:36.540 --> 01:05:37.540]   got, but it was great.
[01:05:37.540 --> 01:05:38.540]   It said, we've unsubscribed.
[01:05:38.540 --> 01:05:40.700]   It was like 30 or 40 things now.
[01:05:40.700 --> 01:05:42.340]   Here's three more pending.
[01:05:42.340 --> 01:05:45.580]   And here's a couple that need action on your part.
[01:05:45.580 --> 01:05:48.380]   And so it's been very effective and it really has made a big difference.
[01:05:48.380 --> 01:05:51.820]   Actually, I was really tempted last night to just get rid of it all.
[01:05:51.820 --> 01:05:54.060]   But I thought, no, I have to save some for this week in Google.
[01:05:54.060 --> 01:05:55.660]   So I'll have something to show them.
[01:05:55.660 --> 01:06:02.620]   You guys also end up, as I do, from, from your life hackert days and Leo from your worldwide
[01:06:02.620 --> 01:06:07.820]   fame, that you end up on a, one of those horrible PR lists.
[01:06:07.820 --> 01:06:09.500]   Lots of PR lists.
[01:06:09.500 --> 01:06:11.140]   And that is the worst of the world.
[01:06:11.140 --> 01:06:12.700]   This works with them, Jeff.
[01:06:12.700 --> 01:06:13.700]   It works with them.
[01:06:13.700 --> 01:06:16.020]   I'm so happy.
[01:06:16.020 --> 01:06:18.420]   It works with PR lists.
[01:06:18.420 --> 01:06:20.540]   So I went subscribe for about 30 of those, Jeff.
[01:06:20.540 --> 01:06:21.540]   That's exactly right.
[01:06:21.540 --> 01:06:23.340]   I am on a million of them.
[01:06:23.340 --> 01:06:24.340]   Interesting.
[01:06:24.340 --> 01:06:25.860]   So it's not just mailing lists.
[01:06:25.860 --> 01:06:27.540]   It's not just, I mean.
[01:06:27.540 --> 01:06:33.020]   So when you just get a PR press release from like some PSPR firm, you can get unsubscribed
[01:06:33.020 --> 01:06:34.020]   and it sends you.
[01:06:34.020 --> 01:06:37.580]   Yeah, because most of them are using constant contact or some other standardized list system.
[01:06:37.580 --> 01:06:38.580]   Right.
[01:06:38.580 --> 01:06:42.500]   And it detects that from the headers and then it's just a, I guess it must.
[01:06:42.500 --> 01:06:47.860]   And so if it's just like some dumb guy at PR firm, like does it send an email to the
[01:06:47.860 --> 01:06:48.860]   team?
[01:06:48.860 --> 01:06:50.860]   Some dumb guy at PR firm.com.
[01:06:50.860 --> 01:06:55.300]   Does it sound like a lot of people are like, what does it tell you at that point?
[01:06:55.300 --> 01:06:56.300]   That's a good question.
[01:06:56.300 --> 01:06:58.540]   So far, I haven't had that happen.
[01:06:58.540 --> 01:06:59.540]   That it probably does.
[01:06:59.540 --> 01:07:04.100]   I find all the time the problem is that I'll get some dumb guy at the PR firm and I get
[01:07:04.100 --> 01:07:09.220]   my 20th email and I finally just get pissed off and I just send an unsubscribed bonus.
[01:07:09.220 --> 01:07:11.180]   Now if they were smart, they'd just do it.
[01:07:11.180 --> 01:07:12.180]   They'd just send me an attention.
[01:07:12.180 --> 01:07:13.180]   Of course, then they send me email back.
[01:07:13.180 --> 01:07:14.180]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:07:14.180 --> 01:07:15.180]   Right.
[01:07:15.180 --> 01:07:19.500]   And then another one confirming that I'm off and I did the, I just wanted off.
[01:07:19.500 --> 01:07:24.580]   I'm sure if they're not using some special software to do this, that it's not, you know,
[01:07:24.580 --> 01:07:25.580]   it's not going to work.
[01:07:25.580 --> 01:07:26.580]   Right.
[01:07:26.580 --> 01:07:27.940]   You just have to send a personal thing.
[01:07:27.940 --> 01:07:32.540]   But I have to say almost all my bacon is using some sort of system.
[01:07:32.540 --> 01:07:33.540]   Right.
[01:07:33.540 --> 01:07:36.540]   Because they're not going to do individual emails they're going to use.
[01:07:36.540 --> 01:07:43.420]   So I don't want to focus on any one person, but here's one for immediate release.
[01:07:43.420 --> 01:07:45.020]   See when I see that right at the top there?
[01:07:45.020 --> 01:07:46.020]   Yep.
[01:07:46.020 --> 01:07:47.100]   I say, yeah, okay.
[01:07:47.100 --> 01:07:51.900]   I'm sure that'll be interesting, but why don't I just press this unsubscribe button right
[01:07:51.900 --> 01:07:52.900]   here?
[01:07:52.900 --> 01:07:53.900]   It's so cathartic.
[01:07:53.900 --> 01:07:54.900]   It really is.
[01:07:54.900 --> 01:07:55.900]   That's exciting.
[01:07:55.900 --> 01:07:58.020]   That's all that's as good as not important.
[01:07:58.020 --> 01:08:02.100]   And if you map, if you do this and then keep your fingers on the left bracket and right
[01:08:02.100 --> 01:08:05.660]   bracket, you can just scroll through all your mail, unsubscribe.
[01:08:05.660 --> 01:08:07.460]   Oh, oh, oh.
[01:08:07.460 --> 01:08:09.340]   Unsubscribe and there you go.
[01:08:09.340 --> 01:08:10.340]   Unsubscribe.
[01:08:10.340 --> 01:08:16.100]   And you know, no, no insult here meant, but unsubscribe and archive all the way down the
[01:08:16.100 --> 01:08:17.100]   line.
[01:08:17.100 --> 01:08:20.700]   Can you mark the little left boxes and do it and batch?
[01:08:20.700 --> 01:08:22.700]   No, well, maybe I don't know.
[01:08:22.700 --> 01:08:23.980]   I haven't tried that.
[01:08:23.980 --> 01:08:26.420]   It's kind of they're afraid of the power that would unleash.
[01:08:26.420 --> 01:08:30.420]   I think it's kind of fun to hear as a gift for Leo unsubscribe.
[01:08:30.420 --> 01:08:35.500]   Kevin, you're right as tempting to go ahead and unsubscribe to my entire world and see
[01:08:35.500 --> 01:08:36.500]   who comes back.
[01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:37.500]   Yeah.
[01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:38.500]   Exactly.
[01:08:38.500 --> 01:08:40.980]   If you're a human, you can come back if you're if you if this worked.
[01:08:40.980 --> 01:08:45.380]   And so I just they say in some cases it may take a while and so forth, but I I love the
[01:08:45.380 --> 01:08:46.380]   report.
[01:08:46.380 --> 01:08:47.380]   I can't pull it up.
[01:08:47.380 --> 01:08:51.900]   I would love to pull it up for you, but it's really it's a nice little nice little feature.
[01:08:51.900 --> 01:08:52.900]   Good tip Leo.
[01:08:52.900 --> 01:08:53.900]   Unsubscribe.com.
[01:08:53.900 --> 01:08:58.900]   Well, and I wish they could be really what are they charge for the $19 a year.
[01:08:58.900 --> 01:08:59.900]   Fine.
[01:08:59.900 --> 01:09:04.420]   And if you do it right, I probably don't need to see see where Birdock.
[01:09:04.420 --> 01:09:05.420]   That's worth paying for.
[01:09:05.420 --> 01:09:06.420]   Yeah.
[01:09:06.420 --> 01:09:07.420]   Yeah.
[01:09:07.420 --> 01:09:09.740]   Repeated news is not worth paying.
[01:09:09.740 --> 01:09:10.740]   No.
[01:09:10.740 --> 01:09:11.740]   That's worth paying for.
[01:09:11.740 --> 01:09:12.740]   Yeah.
[01:09:12.740 --> 01:09:14.300]   Getting rid of people who irritate me.
[01:09:14.300 --> 01:09:15.300]   That's worth paying.
[01:09:15.300 --> 01:09:21.300]   You can tell that we're all just like just been hammered with all this crap for so long
[01:09:21.300 --> 01:09:22.620]   that we're just bitter.
[01:09:22.620 --> 01:09:27.460]   By the way, this is a little meta, but unsubscribe.com does have a unsubscribe.
[01:09:27.460 --> 01:09:28.460]   Nice.
[01:09:28.460 --> 01:09:31.900]   I don't know what it means.
[01:09:31.900 --> 01:09:35.900]   I don't even know if it works, but there you there you go.
[01:09:35.900 --> 01:09:41.420]   And they are on Twitter as unsubscribe. unsubscribe me at unsubscribe me.
[01:09:41.420 --> 01:09:46.380]   So Leo, I figured out the other tweet you were in recently that you responded to.
[01:09:46.380 --> 01:09:47.380]   And I wanted to mention it.
[01:09:47.380 --> 01:09:48.900]   I forget the guy's name because it was wonderful.
[01:09:48.900 --> 01:09:51.860]   I was in Chipotle, which I go to very often.
[01:09:51.860 --> 01:09:54.420]   A little bit of rice, a lot of black beans.
[01:09:54.420 --> 01:09:56.460]   And I'm saying that in the line.
[01:09:56.460 --> 01:10:01.620]   And the guy in front of me looks around quizzically and from the voice alone, he said, you're
[01:10:01.620 --> 01:10:02.620]   on twig.
[01:10:02.620 --> 01:10:03.620]   Oh, wow.
[01:10:03.620 --> 01:10:04.620]   Wow.
[01:10:04.620 --> 01:10:05.620]   Which I love those moments.
[01:10:05.620 --> 01:10:06.620]   Yeah.
[01:10:06.620 --> 01:10:07.620]   Wow.
[01:10:07.620 --> 01:10:08.620]   That's pretty cool.
[01:10:08.620 --> 01:10:09.620]   That is cool.
[01:10:09.620 --> 01:10:10.620]   That's pretty cool.
[01:10:10.620 --> 01:10:11.620]   Thank you for being here.
[01:10:11.620 --> 01:10:12.620]   We really appreciate it.
[01:10:12.620 --> 01:10:16.940]   Kevin's book, The Complete Guide to Android.
[01:10:16.940 --> 01:10:18.940]   You stopped me from before I said wave.
[01:10:18.940 --> 01:10:19.940]   The complete.
[01:10:19.940 --> 01:10:20.940]   Yes.
[01:10:20.940 --> 01:10:22.900]   It's just built in.
[01:10:22.900 --> 01:10:27.980]   I just have to mention real quick that if you follow us on Twitter at a complete Android,
[01:10:27.980 --> 01:10:33.460]   all one word, this week we're giving away a 20% discount to the book.
[01:10:33.460 --> 01:10:39.100]   And you get that by DMing us from, you know, we have an auto follow just for this week.
[01:10:39.100 --> 01:10:42.860]   And you DM us and we will send you a coupon code.
[01:10:42.860 --> 01:10:45.260]   And we are doing that until Friday at midnight.
[01:10:45.260 --> 01:10:48.500]   I think the coupon code changes every day.
[01:10:48.500 --> 01:10:50.740]   But that way you get 20% off the book.
[01:10:50.740 --> 01:10:52.540]   And what's the complete guide?
[01:10:52.540 --> 01:10:54.940]   No, it's a complete Android, Kevin.
[01:10:54.940 --> 01:10:56.340]   Twitter.com/completeandroid.
[01:10:56.340 --> 01:10:58.340]   Okay, I miss typed it.
[01:10:58.340 --> 01:10:59.340]   Twitter, pleat android.
[01:10:59.340 --> 01:11:00.940]   Let me try that again.
[01:11:00.940 --> 01:11:01.940]   There we go.
[01:11:01.940 --> 01:11:02.940]   There we go.
[01:11:02.940 --> 01:11:03.940]   I'm already following.
[01:11:03.940 --> 01:11:04.940]   I'm already following.
[01:11:04.940 --> 01:11:09.940]   This Twitter stream to feature here on Twigs.
[01:11:09.940 --> 01:11:12.940]   You should follow.
[01:11:12.940 --> 01:11:13.140]   It's just me at three in the morning in my phone.
[01:11:13.140 --> 01:11:16.660]   And so we send out tips and tricks on that feed pretty often.
[01:11:16.660 --> 01:11:21.220]   And like I said, this week if you're following it and you DM us, we'll send you back a coupon
[01:11:21.220 --> 01:11:22.860]   code to get 20% off the book.
[01:11:22.860 --> 01:11:23.860]   That's great.
[01:11:23.860 --> 01:11:29.100]   And you can read online at completeandroidguide.com as well.
[01:11:29.100 --> 01:11:30.100]   And that's correct.
[01:11:30.100 --> 01:11:31.100]   That's correct.
[01:11:31.100 --> 01:11:32.100]   For the paperback, the book is out now.
[01:11:32.100 --> 01:11:35.140]   The book is well at $9, like them on Facebook.
[01:11:35.140 --> 01:11:36.140]   Follow them on Twitter.
[01:11:36.140 --> 01:11:41.980]   DM them for 20% off, 10% off, whatever it is.
[01:11:41.980 --> 01:11:42.980]   Yes.
[01:11:42.980 --> 01:11:43.980]   And it's all done.
[01:11:43.980 --> 01:11:47.300]   And we're going to be updating it though as new things roll into Android.
[01:11:47.300 --> 01:11:50.020]   I would be remiss if I did not ask you.
[01:11:50.020 --> 01:11:54.580]   Which phone is your fave?
[01:11:54.580 --> 01:11:58.620]   Having written a book where I wanted to get new features early, it's the Nexus one.
[01:11:58.620 --> 01:12:03.060]   Still the purest truest Android phone.
[01:12:03.060 --> 01:12:04.060]   I love it too.
[01:12:04.060 --> 01:12:05.740]   Yes, it's really the it's the only pure.
[01:12:05.740 --> 01:12:07.020]   Oh, that sounds terrible.
[01:12:07.020 --> 01:12:10.780]   It's the only Android experience where you're not getting, you know, what a carrier wants
[01:12:10.780 --> 01:12:11.780]   you to see.
[01:12:11.780 --> 01:12:13.780]   Well, as you said, as I walked through those screens, oh, that looks a little.
[01:12:13.780 --> 01:12:16.820]   Oh, that looks a little different because that Motorola stuff on top of it.
[01:12:16.820 --> 01:12:17.820]   Yeah.
[01:12:17.820 --> 01:12:19.820]   Motorola is not as bad as HTC, but still it's a.
[01:12:19.820 --> 01:12:21.780]   On the other hand, I like the HTC widgets.
[01:12:21.780 --> 01:12:24.380]   What's your second choice, Kevin?
[01:12:24.380 --> 01:12:25.940]   Second choice.
[01:12:25.940 --> 01:12:28.980]   Oh, the G2 looks really good from.
[01:12:28.980 --> 01:12:29.980]   The brand new one.
[01:12:29.980 --> 01:12:30.980]   Yeah.
[01:12:30.980 --> 01:12:32.900]   Brand new just out on T-Mobile, I think, for preorder.
[01:12:32.900 --> 01:12:36.260]   But that also has the pretty much the stock Android interface.
[01:12:36.260 --> 01:12:37.260]   Oh, really?
[01:12:37.260 --> 01:12:40.180]   They don't sense on it?
[01:12:40.180 --> 01:12:41.660]   Hmm.
[01:12:41.660 --> 01:12:42.660]   That's interesting.
[01:12:42.660 --> 01:12:43.660]   I'm 50/50 on that.
[01:12:43.660 --> 01:12:46.540]   I've seen screenshots with the stock Android.
[01:12:46.540 --> 01:12:47.540]   I like sense a lot.
[01:12:47.540 --> 01:12:48.540]   Huh?
[01:12:48.540 --> 01:12:49.540]   Yeah.
[01:12:49.540 --> 01:12:50.540]   But it's nice to have the choice.
[01:12:50.540 --> 01:12:52.820]   You know, the nice thing about sense, I'm like blur as you do have the choice.
[01:12:52.820 --> 01:12:53.820]   You can watch the watch.
[01:12:53.820 --> 01:12:56.020]   They're on.
[01:12:56.020 --> 01:12:58.540]   I'm using launcher pro, which is, I think, what you're about to talk about.
[01:12:58.540 --> 01:12:59.540]   Yeah.
[01:12:59.540 --> 01:13:00.540]   Yeah.
[01:13:00.540 --> 01:13:01.540]   I love it.
[01:13:01.540 --> 01:13:02.540]   It gives you a more Google-like launcher.
[01:13:02.540 --> 01:13:03.540]   Yeah.
[01:13:03.540 --> 01:13:04.540]   Really nice.
[01:13:04.540 --> 01:13:07.020]   Crash is periodically, but it's really sweet.
[01:13:07.020 --> 01:13:12.020]   And I have to say, once I got used to the big screen, it's hard for me not to love the
[01:13:12.020 --> 01:13:13.020]   Droid X.
[01:13:13.020 --> 01:13:17.180]   I pressed the last edit I could make on the book.
[01:13:17.180 --> 01:13:22.100]   And as I did it, I saw a market update and there was a new Street View update to the
[01:13:22.100 --> 01:13:23.900]   Google and it'll never end.
[01:13:23.900 --> 01:13:24.900]   It will never end.
[01:13:24.900 --> 01:13:27.540]   We didn't mention that, but yes, Street View has been updated.
[01:13:27.540 --> 01:13:28.580]   And that will update the book.
[01:13:28.580 --> 01:13:30.660]   And thanks so much for reading and following it.
[01:13:30.660 --> 01:13:31.660]   There you go.
[01:13:31.660 --> 01:13:32.660]   Kevin Purdy, thank you for being here.
[01:13:32.660 --> 01:13:33.660]   Gina Trapani.
[01:13:33.660 --> 01:13:36.220]   It was also a regular on this show.
[01:13:36.220 --> 01:13:38.460]   And we're glad you're here.
[01:13:38.460 --> 01:13:43.660]   She is at smarter word.org and also watch for her new series at Fast Company.
[01:13:43.660 --> 01:13:44.660]   Oh, yeah.
[01:13:44.660 --> 01:13:45.660]   Fast Company.com/worksmart.
[01:13:45.660 --> 01:13:48.900]   Actually, Leo, your video is live today.
[01:13:48.900 --> 01:13:49.900]   Yay.
[01:13:49.900 --> 01:13:51.620]   And security passwords at LastPass.
[01:13:51.620 --> 01:13:52.620]   Yay.
[01:13:52.620 --> 01:13:54.660]   So thank you for your time on that, Leo.
[01:13:54.660 --> 01:13:55.660]   You give me credibility, man.
[01:13:55.660 --> 01:13:57.860]   Give me a break.
[01:13:57.860 --> 01:13:58.860]   Your Gina Trapani.
[01:13:58.860 --> 01:14:00.620]   I know, why tell Leo over here?
[01:14:00.620 --> 01:14:02.780]   He's going to give a little advice.
[01:14:02.780 --> 01:14:03.780]   His work smart.
[01:14:03.780 --> 01:14:04.940]   I just want to see you.
[01:14:04.940 --> 01:14:06.420]   I didn't say much anyway.
[01:14:06.420 --> 01:14:07.420]   It was a quick thing.
[01:14:07.420 --> 01:14:08.420]   Good.
[01:14:08.420 --> 01:14:09.420]   That's cool.
[01:14:09.420 --> 01:14:10.420]   I can't wait to see that.
[01:14:10.420 --> 01:14:11.420]   Thank you.
[01:14:11.420 --> 01:14:12.420]   It looks like a lot of fun.
[01:14:12.420 --> 01:14:15.420]   A great series for people who haven't seen it.
[01:14:15.420 --> 01:14:17.420]   This is just the nicest part of the internet.
[01:14:17.420 --> 01:14:19.060]   It's all the good people.
[01:14:19.060 --> 01:14:20.380]   It's the nicest people.
[01:14:20.380 --> 01:14:21.380]   It's good people.
[01:14:21.380 --> 01:14:22.380]   It makes me feel good.
[01:14:22.380 --> 01:14:27.620]   Gina wrote a good article, by the way, on the new-- which is also at WorkSmart-- on
[01:14:27.620 --> 01:14:29.220]   the new Twitter.com.
[01:14:29.220 --> 01:14:32.620]   I mentioned this, but you have a very good article on here.
[01:14:32.620 --> 01:14:33.620]   Thanks.
[01:14:33.620 --> 01:14:35.620]   People want to know more about it.
[01:14:35.620 --> 01:14:42.100]   Mr. Jeff Jarvis is a professor of journalism, Professor 2.0, as we call him.
[01:14:42.100 --> 01:14:43.860]   He'll give one to anybody.
[01:14:43.860 --> 01:14:49.860]   At the City University of New York, his blog is Buzzmachine.com, his book.
[01:14:49.860 --> 01:14:52.540]   What the hell would Google do?
[01:14:52.540 --> 01:14:55.260]   Said just like that is available in the bookstores everywhere.
[01:14:55.260 --> 01:14:56.260]   Thank you, Jeff, for being here.
[01:14:56.260 --> 01:14:57.260]   You're going to be here next week.
[01:14:57.260 --> 01:14:58.260]   You're not traveling?
[01:14:58.260 --> 01:15:00.220]   From Picnic in Amsterdam.
[01:15:00.220 --> 01:15:03.340]   Why don't you just move to Europe for crying out?
[01:15:03.340 --> 01:15:04.340]   I know.
[01:15:04.340 --> 01:15:06.300]   This is the last one for a while.
[01:15:06.300 --> 01:15:07.300]   Well, actually not.
[01:15:07.300 --> 01:15:08.300]   That's almost level.
[01:15:08.300 --> 01:15:10.540]   I'm going platinum this year, Leo.
[01:15:10.540 --> 01:15:11.540]   I'm going platinum.
[01:15:11.540 --> 01:15:12.540]   Wow.
[01:15:12.540 --> 01:15:16.140]   Is that the highest level?
[01:15:16.140 --> 01:15:17.420]   That's the sickest level.
[01:15:17.420 --> 01:15:18.420]   Sickest.
[01:15:18.420 --> 01:15:19.420]   It's a special card.
[01:15:19.420 --> 01:15:20.700]   You get a card.
[01:15:20.700 --> 01:15:21.700]   It doesn't do anything.
[01:15:21.700 --> 01:15:22.700]   Ninja card.
[01:15:22.700 --> 01:15:23.700]   All right.
