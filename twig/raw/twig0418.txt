[00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.480]   Yes back when people read when computer magazines weren't those the days
[00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:38.780]   There are still some paper computer magazines. Yeah, but you know they're not the big
[00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.960]   Shoppers what I miss you could build furniture. Oh, yeah, yeah a

[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.760]   Did you have a great time? Oh
[00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.440]   I did always in the Pacific Northwest I
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.200]   Was and it was so much cooler and ice
[00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:10.000]   You should you should move up here. It's it's nice. I believe that yes up here
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.160]   You did do you modify show this picture is from your Twitter? So obviously you oh, yeah, yeah
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.560]   This is Stacy doing circus training on a trapeze hanging upside down
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.520]   And like 20 seconds later I
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:29.880]   Drop my hands and hung there and swung back and forth. It was awesome. Racy. Did Andrew do it just you and your daughter
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:36.400]   Oh, no, just it's my daughter. I have more respect for your husband now than I did before that's insane
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.500]   You're not awesome. Well, we were the reasons came up
[00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.760]   We were talking about roller coasters and you did the California screaming at the at Disney's
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:52.360]   America, what is it all America Park or something California and you did it eight times in a row?
[00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:58.560]   Yeah, we did it was late at night and we just you're a dear devil circling through your dad
[00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:04.240]   Coasters are safe. I guess and my daughter loves roller coasters and so does my husband
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:09.400]   So it's like a bonding activity. I went to high school in Santa Cruz where they have the big dipper
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.600]   Which is an old wooden rollercoaster. That's classic old coasters and people would die on it from yeah
[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:19.960]   You lose a few two or one. Wow. It gave you it made it a more interesting experience
[00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.520]   You know, you know, it's not guaranteed. You're gonna come back
[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:25.480]   It's just adds a little
[00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:32.040]   dollop little son of excitement so excitement. That's exactly I'm glad Jeff Jarvis is in here apparently
[00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.600]   He's still an apoplectic fit or something. I don't know. Hey, you know what the great thing is about President Trump
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.720]   What's that we're not gonna be talking about the Google memo today. Oh
[00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.560]   Instead we're gonna be talking about the daily stormer
[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:48.680]   Uh, yeah, wow, but they did you know what that was kind of neat
[00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:54.680]   So the daily stormer has been around for ages. Yeah, and it is a neo-Nazi website. I don't think they would even
[00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:01.160]   The funny thing is they wouldn't even prevail at that. They wouldn't they would say yeah, you're right. We're a neo-Nazi website
[00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:06.760]   Yeah, they were one of the websites that encouraged the violence in charlotsville
[00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:12.760]   uh told people to go armed with shields and helmets and people did and they did I
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.880]   Think that's safe to say is encouraging violence
[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:23.880]   They had stashes of weapons, uh buried all over the city now the thing that's interesting is they've been hosted by go daddy for years
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.280]   forever
[00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:31.240]   But I guess this was a bridge too far or is just I think more is there's too much publicity now, right?
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:36.920]   Yeah, I think so. I think they're gonna eventually the the white supremacists are gonna have to have their own host something like go
[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.920]   Adolf
[00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:45.160]   Hitler service. Yeah, so
[00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:53.240]   Uh, they got kicked off of go daddy. They went to google for three hours got kicked off there. It was a good three hours though that had
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:57.400]   Uh, and they went from
[00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:02.200]   There to I think they're now on the dark web there. They have a dot onion address is that right?
[00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:07.640]   But still somebody has to host them. Yeah. Yeah, do we know who hosts them? They'll find a host
[00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:11.160]   I don't I don't know who host them at present. Maybe the chat room does but I you know, I think
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:16.760]   It's not impossible to find a host somewhere in the world. It can be anywhere in the world. Yeah, and um
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.680]   well, some people some people hosted out of uh, uh, uh
[00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:27.000]   Support for free speech, right? Right. Yeah. Yeah, russian. Oh, what a surprise russian help
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.360]   Uh, it's found a home on the russian internet after the american tech companies refused
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:38.600]   To host it. They couldn't even you know host the domain lots and lots of things are censored in on the russian internet
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.080]   But not that apparently isn't that funny. Yeah
[00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.440]   Haha funny. Yeah, it's hilarious
[00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:48.120]   Uh, okay anything more to say
[00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:52.360]   I'm like, okay. We covered that way. Yeah. Well, I do think it's interesting that
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:55.400]   So this event
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:00.680]   Is seen as a very negative thing and there is a plus side to it, which is exactly what's happening
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:07.160]   Sure has there being shunned from polite. Yeah, it's really interesting because there's as I said, this is oh, they've oh, this is not a new site
[00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:13.720]   there's uh groups like this on reddit. They've survived although reddit has now pulled down a number of them
[00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:16.040]   Um, so I think yeah by big becoming
[00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:21.160]   more than just uh a kind of a jokey background noise
[00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.280]   Yeah
[00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:27.560]   People take him more seriously and as soon as they're taken more seriously after charlotte's ville then they get pulled down
[00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:31.080]   Now there's an interesting debate. I'm very curious what you think about this because
[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:39.400]   Their uh site. I guess I presume their russian site as well is uh is goes through cloud flare has uh didos an attack protection
[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:41.160]   from cloud flare
[00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:42.920]   uh cloud flare
[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:44.360]   says
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:48.680]   They won't say anything specific about that site, but they say we serve anybody who wants to because
[00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:54.360]   But I heard they dropped them now. Have they dropped them? I believe they have they said it because and I think I kind of support this
[00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:58.680]   Oh good for cloud flare good for cloud flare. I think they kind of support this
[00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:05.800]   I support I understand why they do because they say we're you wouldn't say to the electric company turn off that guy's electricity
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:10.600]   He's a nazi or to the phone company don't allow phone companies by
[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:13.000]   racist people
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.040]   They're common carriers and so they are historically
[00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:21.640]   Not neither responsible nor nor expected to be aware of the kind of content
[00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:24.920]   And I think that was cloud flare's point of view for a while anyway
[00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:28.840]   The the difference is that the difference is that there's a stigmatization of
[00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:34.680]   Of a company that attends that so you know certainly they have the right to continue to host anyone they want
[00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:36.680]   But they're gonna lose some business
[00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:43.560]   And that's just bad business. Yeah, that's you know, and that's I mean you could you could be a cynical and say yeah go daddy and google didn't mind
[00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:48.920]   Having them well google didn't have for customer for a long but go to anyone to mind having for my customer because
[00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:55.800]   Until it became a lie a business liability as opposed to well good for good for cloud flare. I have to say I want to
[00:07:55.800 --> 00:08:03.960]   Fair fair disclosure. They are they have been a sponsor and they had ads today and we we contacted them. He said
[00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:08.200]   Can't do an ad for you today
[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:14.440]   Or ever now actually I had told Lisa if they decided if they changed your mind we'd love to have them back so
[00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:19.160]   But but good. I'm really thrilled to hear that actually. Yeah
[00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:25.400]   It's awesome and and really I think that I think the most important thing is not laws against
[00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:30.120]   These types of groups. I think it's social stigmatization is the key
[00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:34.360]   Scorn and ridicule scorn and ridicule. Yeah, I think that's exactly right
[00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:39.400]   I think also I think and I'm sorry to keep stepping over you um Stacy there
[00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:42.040]   But um just one quick point and then I'll turn it over but
[00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:46.840]   Basically google and and and these other companies go daddy have been hosting them for years
[00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:51.480]   But I think they may be in the same boat. I am I never realized how serious these guys were
[00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:56.440]   Like I knew that that's what I meant. They were jokey back then. You know, I just thought they were just a bunch of wine for years
[00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:58.760]   We've had I'm sorry Stacy. Go ahead
[00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:03.960]   Guys, I'm not in the studio. That's your disadvantage and I'm sorry
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:09.480]   No, I was just gonna say I'm gonna throw something out there because I think that
[00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:15.800]   This idea of being a common carrier is something that even cloud flare so cloud flare
[00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:20.440]   Says this a lot of people say that about google and facebook and even things like
[00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:24.040]   somewhat twitter um that you know
[00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:29.400]   Disboring people from the platform based on their beliefs isn't a great
[00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:39.000]   Isn't a good idea and this isn't just neo-nazi people. This is other people and the question then becomes where do you stop ostracizing folks?
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:45.880]   Well, it's very clear to say Nazis are bad, right? I'm not arguing that Nazis are bad or good
[00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:48.360]   um, but
[00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:50.360]   You know if you have
[00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:52.840]   I'm trying to think of
[00:09:52.840 --> 00:09:56.040]   What group is next to Nazis but not as bad as not?
[00:09:56.040 --> 00:10:03.240]   Men's rights groups men's rights. There you go. Okay, but if men's rights groups start committing acts of terrorism advocate violence
[00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:08.200]   Right terrorism. That's crossing the line. That's right. This this event that took place
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:12.360]   There's no free speech if you're advocating violence. That's not protected speech
[00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:14.760]   That is not protected speech
[00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:19.960]   Insiting violence so and that's that's a good thing to keep in mind is how do we think about that?
[00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:27.320]   Although I would say men's rights groups incite violence. They offer ways to drug women to rape them, which I feel is a pretty violent act
[00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:29.640]   so
[00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:31.800]   But that's the basis on which you you ban them
[00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:35.400]   You don't ban them because they believe in men's rights or whatever it is
[00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:40.920]   You ban them if if the site openly advocates certain things you ban the people
[00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:43.320]   but if the site or the group or whatever
[00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:49.320]   It sort of goes along with those kinds of practices you got to ban it because that's just you know, you're inciting
[00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:55.720]   Violence against people and that's you know, I think that's becoming the universal standard for banning and blocking and censoring and stuff
[00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:57.720]   but I well to defend
[00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:02.280]   See but would you expect the power company to cut off their power?
[00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:08.440]   Well, this is the telecoms argue this when they're talking about they say that they
[00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:15.800]   Google and Facebook all should have to follow some of the same rules they do about being a common carrier
[00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:21.320]   This is this is an argument. I don't necessarily agree with but this is what they talk about when we're talking about net neutrality
[00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:25.400]   So it's it's
[00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:28.920]   Just because they're politically
[00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:33.400]   Challenging I mean, you know, some would look at Hobby Lobby didn't want to offer
[00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:39.240]   Birth control to its employees because that was they claimed. I don't know if I buy it religiously
[00:11:39.240 --> 00:11:46.920]   Against their religious beliefs. That's different. Sure. If you help you have things like and again, I'll go to mra groups
[00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:53.240]   There are definitely places right now sites that google hosts or go daddy hosts that would tell you like hey
[00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:59.000]   There's how you get a woman to have sex with you without consent, right? That's not good. Yeah
[00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:05.720]   But now I would cloud flare. I mean cloud flare hosts or not hosts isn't the right word because they don't host they protect
[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:10.360]   Something like 30 percent of that mean million tens of millions of sites
[00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:16.360]   Uh, they could reasonably I think I understand why they could reasonably say well if we get in the business of saying
[00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:21.560]   Well, this one but not that one. That's a that's a that's a tough never ending battle
[00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:25.080]   Um, so I understood their point of view
[00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:32.280]   To me, it's kind of respond. I'm glad you know what? I'm glad they they basically they did the right thing
[00:12:32.280 --> 00:12:33.720]   Yeah, and I'm glad they did it in fact
[00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:36.680]   I'm gonna give him a free ad in this show because I'm glad they did that
[00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:41.800]   Uh, and we had ads for them earlier today that we decided not to do and but we're gonna give them a
[00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:45.240]   Cloud flare. Thank you. They did the right thing. Matthew prince your CEO
[00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:49.240]   I think I was taking what he believed was a principal stand. Yeah, principal stand
[00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:52.680]   But in the long run that right the price is too high
[00:12:52.760 --> 00:12:59.160]   So here's the here's the thing that's different between google for example and the power company the power company is provides
[00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:05.960]   Heat, you know, you can make food. It's like necessary for your survival. What google does is a massive and historically
[00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:08.680]   brand new amplifier
[00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:12.360]   So if you think of the recruitment that ices has done on the internet
[00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:15.000]   And you realize that you know, yes
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.760]   Uh, ices type people have always existed, but they used to be powerless
[00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:20.760]   They used to be sitting in some place
[00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:24.920]   With no ability to affect global change now they can use the internet
[00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:27.560]   To spread their ideas to recruit
[00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:31.240]   And this is this is what's happening with the with our domestic terrorists as well
[00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:35.960]   They're they're recruiting. They're spreading this stuff using the internet using google using
[00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:42.920]   social apps and all that kind of stuff. So do we really want to just empower everybody with this enormous
[00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:46.040]   capability to spread, you know, uh,
[00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:49.080]   We should also point out that the first amendment does
[00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:52.680]   protect nazis and cluke clucks clan
[00:13:52.680 --> 00:13:56.760]   In that government is not allowed to make a law against exactly
[00:13:56.760 --> 00:14:05.080]   And the exemption as we pointed out is if they if if you yell fire in a crowded theater was that it was just as brand ices famous example
[00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:08.280]   That's not protected because that's dangerous
[00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:16.200]   Um, and that's what i was going to say is i remember for years cluke clucks clan little tiny groups of 12 people
[00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:20.120]   In the town square and everybody would kind of mock them and laugh at them
[00:14:20.120 --> 00:14:24.360]   There was never any violence. They just do their little thing and they and they go off
[00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:28.200]   And it was tolerated in the name of free speech a lot of people didn't like it
[00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:32.440]   But it was tolerated in the name of free speech. They got a permit and they were allowed to do it
[00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:40.920]   The right thing to probably to do would be to surround their protest with peaceful with more speed counter protesters with more speech
[00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:44.440]   Um, it's different though in the net is seaboard
[00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:50.200]   Terrain cognita. This is a very different world. Yeah should the cloud flare does cloud flare now have to block
[00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:56.600]   Let's say they they protect ices sites. I don't know that they do i'm not saying they do but they have to then now they have to go and look for them, right?
[00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:57.800]   Yeah
[00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:00.920]   Well, the thing that the thing that the algorithmically sorted internet
[00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:07.640]   Which is almost the entire internet these days when you're when you're going for content is that it's a dumb beast that we haven't figured it out yet
[00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:11.800]   So essentially let's say that let's say you know i i i
[00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:14.280]   Google blocked daily stormers search results
[00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:18.760]   I don't know but but I think to a certain extent they should because what happens is if you are
[00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:21.800]   Have a certain thing that you look into a lot
[00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:26.680]   It'll give you more of it and and more of it and more of it and the more you get into this rabbit hole
[00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:32.040]   The more extreme the content you can follow that all the way to the worst parts of youtube for example
[00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:38.760]   Where right but you have to have people allowed to search for that for research purposes for government purposes
[00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:44.360]   I mean that's messing with search results. Oh, jeff would love this this is it. Well
[00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:53.640]   We're not going to come to the answer here. I think we know we've demonstrated how tough this is it is. Yeah, absolutely and it's it's a tough call and
[00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:58.920]   What again? And then you have the issue of international, you know different nations have different values
[00:15:58.920 --> 00:16:05.640]   Only the u.s. Has the first amendment other countries have different takes on free speech in germany for example
[00:16:05.880 --> 00:16:10.120]   most of the just the t-shirts these guys were wearing would have put them in jail. Yeah, so
[00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:15.000]   You know, uh, it's it's it's a really really tough thing. It's it's interesting though
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:23.720]   By going so far and you know plowing a car into a yeah band of counter protesters for instance and killing one and injuring many
[00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:29.640]   Um, you're right. They raised the level. So while we while people were tolerating this
[00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:35.480]   The minute that happened. I think it's shifted. Yeah. Yeah, and I think the country
[00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:41.880]   It's interesting to watch what happened today the country shifted not just not just google and go daddy and cloud player
[00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:45.240]   The country shifted. Absolutely. It's it's a clarifying moment
[00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:49.800]   It's it sort of forces everybody to really think about this stuff and to understand what's really going on out there
[00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:52.920]   Right again. I think the internet is a key part of what's different
[00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:59.560]   It's a big big deal if you search right now for daily sturmer on google you get of course mostly what you get is news stories about
[00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:03.800]   Yeah, this whole issue right now, but you will get uh stories that link to
[00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:09.080]   The daily sturmer you're one link away from the daily sturmer, which incidentally according to ours technica
[00:17:09.080 --> 00:17:12.680]   Is down because as soon as cloud flare pulled their doss protection
[00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:17.400]   D-doss protection they got hammered they immediately got hammered and now that you've searched for it
[00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:23.800]   You're going to get advertisements for white white hoods and like the torches that they have all the sheet ads alone
[00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:28.760]   We'll just oh my god. All right. This is a grim subject. I don't want to uh,
[00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:32.760]   Be a laborate. I think we've demonstrated just by talking about we demonstrate how hard this is
[00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:37.080]   To solve and I do think there is an argument for common carrier status
[00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:43.560]   For some of these are we I think we may be asking too much of these companies not for anything in this algorithmic
[00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:50.520]   Because if there's an algorithm rewarding you for with more of the same content, then that's not a neutral thing
[00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:57.880]   Electricity is neutral. It doesn't it doesn't entra you know, it doesn't draw you deeper. That's a good point. D-doss protection
[00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:03.320]   Is in that's an interesting point. Yeah, you are doing something
[00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:09.720]   Now claps are gotten a little bit of trouble because in the past what they had done is if somebody complained about a nazi site
[00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:16.440]   They would send the complaint on to the nazi's including email address and and open those complainants up for harassment
[00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:23.960]   Now they stop doing that almost as immediately as soon as that happened. Yeah, but that shows shows you this is a ca- this is freaking complicated
[00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:31.400]   I don't know. Anyway, thank you cloudflare for solving this for us anyway by by doing I think doing the right thing
[00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:38.440]   You want to talk about the pixel phone because you know how I am super psyched about next generation Google phones
[00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:47.880]   Are you be hey? I got come good news. I got an email this morning from Andy Rubin saying your essential phone is ready. Oh wow
[00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:52.040]   There's an event good timing Andy. I can't wait. There's actually an event Friday
[00:18:52.680 --> 00:18:55.400]   For essential. Yes. Okay, and and of course
[00:18:55.400 --> 00:18:58.520]   Nick and I ordered it and I should have it within seven days
[00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:01.880]   So uh, I made a deal with Jason howl and all about android
[00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:07.160]   I said if it comes by tuesday, you can have it for all about and you can have it and use it on all that anyway
[00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:08.920]   It comes after that it's mine
[00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:12.040]   But the problem is I don't think either of us are going to want to hold on to it for too long
[00:19:12.040 --> 00:19:14.120]   We should just say Andy Rubin who's created
[00:19:14.120 --> 00:19:15.640]   uh
[00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:22.120]   Android the operating system. Yeah sold it to google ran android for many years eventually moved on in google to do something else
[00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:27.320]   Then left google and this was his next act is a android phone before all that was sidekick
[00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:32.280]   Sidekick that's right. He's you know, he's got great credentials. Uh, but what can you do? You know
[00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:37.960]   Is he a one hit wonder? Well, it's not even I know I don't think it's that I think he's a genius
[00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:42.280]   He's brilliant. What can you do today with an android phone that would be in any way
[00:19:42.280 --> 00:19:49.000]   Different yeah, it's really a challenge. Yeah, he's doing the Motorola thing with he's got this the
[00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:53.560]   Pogo pins in the back so you can attach not just cameras, but other things
[00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:56.280]   Uh, he's a bezel is designed
[00:19:56.280 --> 00:20:01.080]   I have to say that I would you would be nuts to buy a phone with a bezel you'll look so 2016
[00:20:01.080 --> 00:20:07.480]   Yeah, wait. No the google phone the new the new fcc filing for it's so ex has no
[00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:09.640]   That looks like it has a bezel
[00:20:09.640 --> 00:20:15.480]   Crap go cool has to be said also that black moon is a great name for something shipping around the time of the eclipse
[00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:18.440]   Is it true?
[00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:20.520]   That's the code name black moon
[00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:22.600]   Well, it's really the black sun
[00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:25.320]   Yeah, that's true. That's true. Excuse me. Maybe the clip is designed
[00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:31.960]   Essentially knocked out by the black. Yeah, the essential the essential phone. Uh, you could get pure white or black moon
[00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:34.120]   Yeah, I don't know black mover. Yeah
[00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:37.720]   Maybe they'll come on it'll come on monday. That'd be fun if it came during the eclipse
[00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:42.040]   Do you is Andy Rubin that clever the sun would come back and there's a package
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.640]   So do they do the fcc filing have
[00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:54.920]   Oh, this is one of the no see the fcc filings for the pixel too. So just not to confuse things more. So we're talking about the essential
[00:20:54.920 --> 00:21:00.840]   Okay, we're done. No, we're done with the essential phone. No. No, we can't be done because they raised 300 million
[00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:04.280]   What well we talked about them raising their money wut
[00:21:04.280 --> 00:21:07.880]   We talked about this last week. Did we the essentials?
[00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:10.360]   It's news. That's okay. Go ahead. Oh
[00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:14.200]   Okay, but now they're a unicorn. They haven't shipped a phone
[00:21:14.280 --> 00:21:16.280]   Oh, I look at the phone and I'm like
[00:21:16.280 --> 00:21:20.360]   How can you be worth the billion dollars when you haven't
[00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:23.560]   Did they I mean were there lots of people like you?
[00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:30.040]   Well, I I don't I think that the money raised was not the phone. It was there. They have a smart home. They're home. Right?
[00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:35.880]   Yeah, that their smart home thing isn't even coming. I mean, that's the least fleshed out part of it
[00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:41.480]   I think the value was Andy Rubin himself everything that he's created. He's sold. It's bought by
[00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:45.800]   You know for huge amounts of money. So they're gonna have a docking station
[00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:50.520]   But he did danger and that was like a 500 million dollar deal
[00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:56.200]   That was back in the days before that was a unicorn for those times. Yeah, that was a lot of money back then
[00:21:56.200 --> 00:22:00.840]   Uh, that guys that guys that guys say you can drop it
[00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:06.040]   Wait, is this the essential or are we done with that? No, I'm not done with it
[00:22:06.040 --> 00:22:08.680]   Uh, it's made out of titanium
[00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:14.680]   Not aluminum or tight if you say how you mini them. Do you say titanium?
[00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:19.720]   I think you should just out of fairness. Hey, wait, Paul johnny. I've
[00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:22.600]   Hey, it's made of titanium
[00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:29.480]   Really what I mean honest if it's a aluminum
[00:22:29.480 --> 00:22:31.720]   All right, I'm just saying
[00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:39.080]   Uh, now they have other colors too. I got black moon. They have pure white stellar gray and ocean depths is pretty that's cute green
[00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:42.120]   I feel like stellar gray is such an oxymoron
[00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:46.280]   You hear that yeah, so is black moon
[00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:49.640]   Well, not really you can't see it, but it's black
[00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:53.960]   Uh with the essential phone stunning edge to edge display. This is the one with the notch
[00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:59.240]   Although you know that notch is going to look prescient when when the next iphone comes out because it has
[00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:02.680]   A bigger notch supposedly what what we've seen
[00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:08.760]   In the middle because it has to accommodate all those extra sensors and samsung will come out with the biggest notch in the industry
[00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:12.120]   The new super notch the not the not the note notch
[00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:19.000]   Uh, I you know you're I ordered it. It's 800 bucks or something. It's ridiculous expensive
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:23.400]   Ridiculously cheap compared to the upcoming iphone. Yeah, maybe yeah
[00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:28.760]   Uh, that's what they're trying to do is have a really premium android phone. We'll have a review for you by next
[00:23:28.760 --> 00:23:35.560]   Show, uh, it now. This is the home base. This is where I think the investment is this looks like a nest
[00:23:36.360 --> 00:23:40.520]   Kind of it's got a it's got a screen face, but it's sitting down instead of on the wall
[00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:47.080]   But he wants it to run all of the all of the assistance well you're the iot person Stacy you think this is credible
[00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:51.080]   Well, he hasn't said enough for me to determine if it's credible
[00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:57.000]   I mean the data on the home is like it'll be magic everything will talk to everything else and I've heard that a thousand times
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   So I'm kind of like
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.200]   Maybe I imagine if I could get my hands on an investor
[00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:04.040]   deck
[00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:08.040]   There'd be information that I could use and be like oh it really is worth a billion dollars
[00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:13.400]   Well, we'll see I think this is a very bad time to be a new phone
[00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:18.520]   That's all I can say you got the no very bad time to be a smart home too
[00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:25.240]   I mean honestly. This is the year of the winnowing the winnowing the smart home smart home the winnowing
[00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:27.800]   That's after the conjuring
[00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:32.920]   Uh, yeah, because what we you saying that because of apple the home. I know i'm saying give it because there's
[00:24:33.480 --> 00:24:35.720]   A lot of companies that got money have
[00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:40.760]   Either died or been acquired. It's just it's time. Yeah
[00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:44.200]   It's been time for a long time
[00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:49.080]   This thing is this is next to the pc
[00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:54.440]   TV convergence. This has been the most overhyped and undid delivered technology
[00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:59.640]   Category and it's two. I think I think the the the wristwatch wearable
[00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:02.200]   Revolution did kind of like
[00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:08.200]   Yeah, and uh, we thought everybody thought that was going to be enormous that everybody be wearing a smartwatch
[00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:12.120]   So i'm gonna see everybody thought this well i'm wearing one
[00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:16.920]   But i'm an 80 i'm wearing a fit it. I think a smartwatch is a demonstration you're not so smart
[00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:23.000]   Yeah, it's like you fell for it. You're right. We fell for the marketing
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.040]   Sucker
[00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:30.040]   I should say that I know many of you. It's a it's a $400 advice that does that gives you $25 worth of value
[00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:33.800]   I'll show you how smart I am. I bought the $1,200 device. This is the
[00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:39.640]   edition the ceramic because i said super beauty i think ceramic i'm as interested in the material
[00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:42.840]   Yeah, and it you know to it does it cool hasn't scratched
[00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:45.960]   Um
[00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:50.680]   All right, but my my original point is what a crappy time release of phone Andy
[00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:54.440]   You've got the note eight is going to be announced on wednesday probably
[00:25:55.080 --> 00:26:02.360]   Free order and delivery typically sam song announces you order and you get it pretty quickly like the next week or two
[00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:03.240]   So
[00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:08.600]   I the note eight's going to hit the market and the reason they want to hit the market now is because the iphone will be announced within a month
[00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:10.200]   Almost certainly
[00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:12.680]   Yep, latest iphone and it's going to be fancy
[00:26:12.680 --> 00:26:15.240]   schmancy it ought to be for
[00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:17.720]   More than a thousand dollars. There'll be three
[00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:21.160]   So the latest thinking is there'll be three iphones. They'll be
[00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:24.840]   something equivalent to a seven plus
[00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:27.800]   I'm sorry seven s and seven s plus
[00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:35.320]   Uh, and then they'll be the iphone 10 or iphone pro or maybe just iphone
[00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:40.440]   Right, uh, that was this those are the three names last yesterday last makbriq weekly
[00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:45.240]   Yeah, we talked about this those are the potentials. I'm going for the pro because they've announced a iMac pro
[00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:49.800]   Right and they have the ipad pro i'm going for iphone pro. Yeah
[00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:57.320]   No matter what pro all the way. Yeah, you are professional. Yeah, it's like one of those armor sets you get in world of warcraft
[00:26:57.320 --> 00:27:03.240]   You got to collect the whole right pro set if you want to be fully protected. It's exactly like that
[00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:08.840]   I have the uh, do you miss of which crafting?
[00:27:08.840 --> 00:27:11.720]   armor yet and the the
[00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:16.200]   Boots of legionnaires disease. I'm ready. I'm ready to go
[00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:23.000]   Uh back to your point though. I mean, I what i'm curious about is andy rumin andy rumin is a really smart guy
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:29.240]   Sidekick and android. We're both completely out of the box products and great. I loved my sidekick
[00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:35.240]   Oh, yeah, I loved my son. Oh, yeah, and so I way ahead of it's there's got to be something about this phone that we don't know about yet
[00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:42.520]   That justifies it its existence. It can't just be another android phone. It can't edge it, you know made out of titanium. I fear it might be
[00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:47.160]   I fear it might I where it we're such peak phone. It's hard to imagine what you would do
[00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:55.800]   If you have an ecosystem a massive ecosystem as apple does you could push people to ar kid, right? You can't as andy rumin
[00:27:55.800 --> 00:27:59.720]   With a phone nobody has push people into
[00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:05.080]   Whatever it is. He's hoping to create a platform for there's no way this can be a platform. You don't have enough clout
[00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:11.960]   Yeah, I think timing I think timing is and you might have made the same argument with psychic timing on that was it was too early
[00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:14.120]   Right. This might be too late. Yeah
[00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:21.880]   And then so let's talk about the pixel so google's pixel phones the pixel two are not expected to be out
[00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:25.480]   What's the latest you said they just went for fcc approval?
[00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:31.240]   Yeah, there was an fcc filing for the htc google pixel two. So we're not sure
[00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:35.960]   It is a little one the big one will be the lg
[00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:39.000]   And the htc will be the little one
[00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:47.640]   They the thinking is that htc is going to put its dopey squeeze me feature in it is
[00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:53.240]   Dopey it says that in the oh it does it says in the file it says it says the active edge
[00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:59.720]   Yes, squeeze features part of the filings. So why do you call it dopey? I'm curious because I I really like
[00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:05.080]   I loved my moto because it had those kind of short gestures. I love the gestures. Yes
[00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:08.440]   No, no, I agree with you the moto x you
[00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:13.880]   If you did if you checked it like this it would launch the you know like twist your wrist to launch the camera
[00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:16.040]   Yeah, what was the flashlight was a v
[00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:23.640]   You just shook it twice or something. Oh, I thought that was a camera. Oh, no the camera was a you just twisted it
[00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:27.800]   Okay, this is by the way. We are now illustrating the problem
[00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:35.160]   No, you did this you did this and then you did this. Yeah, and I would always turn the flashlight on by accident
[00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:37.800]   uh
[00:29:37.880 --> 00:29:42.600]   So this squeeze harate chop. That's what it was. That's how I always I was I was like
[00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:47.720]   There was another one. What was the other one?
[00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:53.000]   I just did the camera in the karate chop. I think it was when you picked it up. It just turned on. Yeah, I was like that. Oh, yeah
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.040]   Yeah, yeah, or if you put it down in the phone and hang out something something like that
[00:29:56.040 --> 00:29:58.040]   But the point is that those kinds of things are
[00:29:58.040 --> 00:30:04.280]   Theoretically cool. I think what where we're headed because of AR we're getting all these like there's a rumor that they next
[00:30:04.280 --> 00:30:10.120]   iPhone will have a laser in it there but all these phones will have ways to detect what's going on in 3d in space and
[00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:16.360]   Distance which means we'll be able to use in the air gestures the phone on the table will be able to like swipe their things by doing this
[00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:20.040]   All some phones already do that of course, but those will become more sophisticated
[00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:22.600]   I think and and that that's gonna be pretty great
[00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:28.680]   I don't have a problem with gestures, but they have to be organic. They have to be fit into for instance
[00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:32.120]   Uh, most android phones have a gesture where if you shake it
[00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:38.440]   We were so angry it then pops up a tech support bug. Yeah, bug report
[00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:44.040]   Yeah, that seems organic and natural because you're already pissed off and you're shaking your eyes
[00:30:44.040 --> 00:30:49.880]   I feel like a lot of things weren't originally organic. So remember turning on the iPhone
[00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:53.880]   Pinch to zoom swiping field. They don't they do you think they've felt
[00:30:53.880 --> 00:30:56.440]   Unusual I think
[00:30:56.440 --> 00:31:00.840]   Pinching is what's happening. You're making it bigger. That's natural
[00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:05.400]   Yes, and no, I mean
[00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:12.280]   I'm afraid to ask but what else gets bigger when you when you pinch it. I mean, it's like I know it looks
[00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:19.160]   Odd, but what I'm trying to do is I'm just I just feel like that's that's exactly right. You want to make that bigger? You go like that
[00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:25.960]   But it is a natural perfect example of an organic gesture, but why is that natural? What else in the world does that?
[00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:28.840]   Well, everything else
[00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:31.000]   Well, so the point is apple
[00:31:31.160 --> 00:31:35.560]   Apple picked a gesture that made sense for people actually it may be
[00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:37.960]   Predated apple, but anyway, sorry
[00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:45.480]   You're right. Sorry, but the gesture there made sense and I don't know if it was organic so much as they picked something
[00:31:45.480 --> 00:31:51.000]   That seemed more natural now. I think that I mean, I'll be honest
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:56.360]   I think that turning your camera turning your phone around to open the camera it does seem kind of natural because yeah
[00:31:56.360 --> 00:31:58.920]   You're looking at it and you're like whoop or whoop
[00:31:59.560 --> 00:32:04.600]   Um, that's the challenge though because you can't do it just once because that would happen accidentally so you have to do it twice
[00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:08.520]   I think you just did it. I feel like you just did it once
[00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:11.640]   I want the camera to take a selfie when I do it. You just had to have a
[00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:14.280]   enough like
[00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:19.800]   Yeah, here's a good example. How about double tap to zoom does that seem and that was something that apple did
[00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:22.920]   invent for safari
[00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:26.840]   So you could be looking at a web page and a web page on a small screen would be too small
[00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:31.720]   You double tap the paragraph and it brilliantly zoomed just to fill the screen just right
[00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:38.120]   Yeah, that wouldn't I guess that would be one where that wouldn't be a natural gesture, but it but we quickly incorporated it. Yeah
[00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:42.600]   So so okay, so I the counter example is I think
[00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:47.560]   Prose that you could have a gesture that doesn't natural but does become part of the
[00:32:47.560 --> 00:32:52.760]   Vocabulary and you do need you do need to expand the vocab user interface vocabulary
[00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:57.560]   Especially with things like phones and watches where well, you're really limited so squeeze to get back to squeeze
[00:32:57.560 --> 00:33:02.280]   I'm what does squeeze do? I know it on the HTC builds your forearm muscles
[00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:06.120]   Fitness you squeeze the phone has to be so
[00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:08.680]   Stress
[00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:15.320]   Something that comes natural is at least if it's not organic at least makes sense after you do it a few times
[00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:19.720]   But isn't triggered accidentally and I guess people I feel like I squeeze my phone a lot
[00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:25.960]   Like you're holding it. Yeah. I mean it's sometimes you would hold it hard. Maybe not
[00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:31.240]   Well, I know I does anybody in the channel have one of these HTC. What is it the 11?
[00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:36.680]   I'm curious what it what it does. Anyway, this will be HTC will build this into the new
[00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:40.040]   pixel to small version
[00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:43.480]   Uh, yeah, it's the u11
[00:33:43.480 --> 00:33:48.440]   It's branded as active edge. It's in the languages input and gestures setting
[00:33:50.200 --> 00:33:53.320]   Uh, it's to launch like a macro you can program launches. No launch
[00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:58.040]   Well, maybe it is but on on delivery it launches the google assistant that I like
[00:33:58.040 --> 00:34:01.560]   It's not intuitive, but
[00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:07.480]   Maybe it would be because you need a easy way to launch the assistant and it can't be okay. You know who yeah, right?
[00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:09.640]   That's that's not that's problematic
[00:34:09.640 --> 00:34:16.280]   All right, so you squeeze it now, but what's going to be weird is the bigger pixel made by lg will not have that feature
[00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:17.400]   I don't think
[00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:22.360]   Storage is listed as 50 gigabyte. This is all from the fcc filing 50 gigabytes free
[00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:28.760]   When 21 percent is used that means well, it's a 64 gig capacity
[00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:32.760]   The device's processor
[00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:35.720]   Uh is likely to be a
[00:34:35.720 --> 00:34:43.400]   It's either a snapdragon 660 or an 835 could be 835 right? It's gotta be the 835
[00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:50.680]   That's they know that because the quarkon Wi-Fi chip used only works with those two snap dragons. So it'll be an 835
[00:34:50.680 --> 00:34:56.760]   Doesn't I don't think there's any information about screen resolution
[00:34:56.760 --> 00:35:00.680]   Or actual size
[00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:07.240]   See here be model g 011 a maiden Taiwan
[00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:11.000]   These are the screenshots
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:17.480]   This is oh they have to show I guess the FCC where you would find
[00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:24.680]   The legal information FCC very kindly allowed phone manufacturers to stop printing that on the back of the phone
[00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:29.960]   It was so ugly, but you have to still show them you've got that information and where it's where it's hiding. I guess
[00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:33.640]   Under legal information. All right. Well, I guess that's all we know
[00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:39.560]   But if the okay, so FCC how well okay, here's a question
[00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:42.680]   How long does FCC approval take?
[00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:45.080]   You're not a lot of times
[00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:49.240]   Well, a lot of times you don't file with the FCC until you're ready to launch it
[00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:56.280]   Is historically what companies do because this outs what you're doing, right? Um, so it's ready
[00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:59.960]   But it can't be delivered until you get FCC approval
[00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:07.720]   Right, but that can take as little as like a week to a month and if you're like a vendor like HTC or lg and know what you're doing
[00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:12.680]   Oh, that's I mean unless you've got some weird bits and bobs in there
[00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:16.760]   But then you could redact everything if they didn't redact everything I got to think that
[00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:20.840]   And they and they are in a hurry because they're gonna have a few good
[00:36:20.840 --> 00:36:28.200]   You know short period of time before the iphone hits well remember last year that both google and sam sung announced right before the apple
[00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:34.840]   That's not good. I don't think google's gonna be able to do it before I mean apple's event will this is the 16th
[00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:42.120]   Yeah, it will almost certainly be in the next month, but I don't I September but do I I don't think they're gonna ship the super phone
[00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:45.800]   On that day. I think they're gonna say well it's funny. He comes out in november
[00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:50.680]   It's funny. There's been back and forth on that the latest supply chain rumors from ming qi
[00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:56.280]   Uh who has been pretty good once you get this close especially with supply chain things
[00:36:56.280 --> 00:37:00.760]   Is that all three phones will ship at the same time? And how does he not call his site the status quo?
[00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:04.360]   That's a perfect name because he works for some other company
[00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:08.920]   Um some some analysts some securities come you know and that's very possible
[00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:13.640]   But maybe they all shipen of them. I just I just seems like the way the rumors are
[00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:19.320]   The rumors about they're still deciding on various things. That's always true, but we're getting close now
[00:37:19.320 --> 00:37:23.080]   I mean I I will be willing to bet that apple will be on a normal schedule
[00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:29.160]   They're parent according to again to quote. They are in ramped up production on on the mall three models
[00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:34.040]   So uh, I've seen uh leaked videos of yeah
[00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:37.320]   So uh, I I'm gonna guess
[00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:40.440]   That usually they do it
[00:37:40.440 --> 00:37:45.000]   They have to wait till after labor day so they would do it on a wednesday after labor day typically. Yeah
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.320]   Uh, which would be this year
[00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:51.160]   I think we said september 8th. Let me look at my calendar
[00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:54.680]   and then uh
[00:37:54.680 --> 00:37:58.760]   So september 6th is the wednesday after labor day
[00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:04.920]   Uh, rene richy. I think thought maybe they throw everybody a monkey wrenching doing on the 8th friday
[00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:06.200]   Yeah
[00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:11.160]   Or if they want to wait then the tuesday or monday or tuesday after that which would be the 11th or 12th
[00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:14.520]   Typically in the past and this has been true for several years
[00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:19.320]   They will give say we'll say pre-orders on friday. Yeah delivery two weeks after that
[00:38:19.320 --> 00:38:24.920]   Do we know if they are ready to announce and use the steve jobs ampetheatre at apple pie?
[00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:29.880]   I asked that too because that's the and i'd be shocked if they weren't it's the 10th anniversary iphone
[00:38:29.880 --> 00:38:36.280]   The thing to understand about that is this genius for secrecy you can announce the event the day before right and everybody would show up
[00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:41.880]   And you'd have no like people taking pictures of the banners and stuff like that at uh in september, sisco
[00:38:41.880 --> 00:38:46.440]   So the campus is is being occupied in fact
[00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:54.200]   Yeah, it's not a google story, but that's one of the stories is that people who hate it. They hate it. They open plan. Yeah, really bad idea
[00:38:55.160 --> 00:39:01.160]   Oh, I shouldn't laugh that's sad. Uh people always hate new offices. That's not that
[00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:06.120]   But but open plans are particularly irritating. Yeah, they're a bad idea
[00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:11.640]   This is not the one I want to show them and somebody in the chat room said that the apple park isn't ready and and stuff like that
[00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:16.680]   They haven't planted grass and stuff like that, but that doesn't the amphitheater is kind of a separate thing
[00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:18.360]   It's it's on the property
[00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:20.920]   But the parking for it is outside the property
[00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:24.360]   So when you when there is an event you park sort of across the street
[00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:28.120]   And then they shuttle you in or there's a secret tunnel or I don't know how you get there
[00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:32.840]   But basically it doesn't matter if the rest of the campus is available is ready to go or not
[00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:38.200]   The amphitheaters its own thing and nobody knows how done that is now this this is about three weeks old
[00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:45.480]   They've actually stopped drones now for flying over. Yeah, so this is the last row. This is dungansin fields. Uh, there's by the way
[00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:48.120]   Oh, it's done. That's ready. Look in there
[00:39:48.680 --> 00:39:53.960]   That I would say that's this the uh, steve jobs theater is the little the staircase where you go down into the yeah
[00:39:53.960 --> 00:39:56.120]   And we can't we'll never know
[00:39:56.120 --> 00:39:58.120]   See the staircase there. We'll never know
[00:39:58.120 --> 00:40:02.600]   What's underground whether that's ready because we can't see it, but look I think this is ready
[00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:04.760]   Yeah, it looks pretty ready. That was three weeks ago
[00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:07.720]   Uh three weeks from now or four weeks from now, of course that'll be ready. Yeah
[00:40:07.720 --> 00:40:14.360]   Admittedly, it's gonna be muddy and dirty, but they'll uh, I would know then it may not be ready by apple standards
[00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:20.360]   That's interesting boy. This is a this is a chance to get a lot of press for your campus. Yeah
[00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:26.760]   It is the 10th anniversary iphone. Yeah, they do have that problem if they want to get uh, you know
[00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:29.800]   Flint center, which is probably where they would have it in san jose
[00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:34.040]   Right. They they'd have to book it already. Yeah, I mean really they they don't
[00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:38.840]   For the exterior the parts where they would allow the rifraff press to wander around
[00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:43.480]   Uh, they don't they're gonna plant grass. They're gonna put turf on this and have it ready
[00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:46.200]   They're gonna roll it out like you know like like a rug
[00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:48.920]   Um the trees are all in
[00:40:48.920 --> 00:40:52.520]   They're not gonna bring them into the inner circle
[00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:56.200]   In fact, that's part of the fact that that is the thing that uh
[00:40:56.200 --> 00:41:02.520]   Andy and ako and rene which on our mac break weekly said would be the thing that would hold it up as if they weren't able to control
[00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:09.560]   Journalists and keep them in the steve jobs theater area. That's one rene richy anywhere near this campus until it's completely done
[00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:12.520]   Yeah, you don't want but but on the other hand what a what a I mean
[00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:14.680]   I'm sure this is what they've been shooting for yeah
[00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:20.280]   It would be a bit of a letdown. Yep if they couldn't do this right I would think it
[00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:23.720]   We've all we've all I mean if you've ever built to anything you know that
[00:41:23.720 --> 00:41:29.720]   And I haven't it's kind of like you're like they'll be like you'll be in by christmas or you'll be in by this date
[00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:35.240]   And then you know a permit gets delayed or a contractor gets sick
[00:41:35.240 --> 00:41:39.320]   Tell me if i'm wrong now somebody's saying oh you can't have people until there's an occupancy license
[00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:44.360]   But they are putting employees in right yes, they are so they have an occupancy license. I think they do
[00:41:44.360 --> 00:41:46.200]   so
[00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:48.840]   I think they do so I think it's I mean really it's um
[00:41:48.840 --> 00:41:55.560]   The external parts of it look less like we're saying let it look less done than they actually are this did they're just you know
[00:41:55.560 --> 00:42:01.640]   Right it's grass move the mounds of dirt move the trucks off and put some grass down. They're pretty much done stuff always looks bad
[00:42:01.640 --> 00:42:06.840]   Right up to the day right right right and there's but there is a lot like
[00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:12.600]   Again anytime you move into a renovation or renovated office new office new home whatever
[00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:17.560]   There's always that that last 10 percent that is like I know
[00:42:17.560 --> 00:42:20.280]   It's forever. I know
[00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:23.640]   It's so true you did you build your house or just uh
[00:42:23.640 --> 00:42:27.400]   You know we built it so you know we built it. Oh god
[00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:33.560]   It was but I would also say that it also just before occupation looks like they're never gonna get this done and then boom
[00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:35.720]   It's suddenly done. Yeah, that's true
[00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:41.480]   The two most surprising things about building a house or framing because that's like super fast and you're like whoa
[00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:43.640]   It's done. There's a house there wow
[00:42:43.640 --> 00:42:45.880]   and then
[00:42:45.880 --> 00:42:53.240]   Then like the week before you move in when like, you know, there's electric there wires hanging out walls and crap everywhere
[00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:55.240]   And you're like this isn't gonna happen
[00:42:55.240 --> 00:43:00.840]   I love really being completely unhandy and not knowing anything because then it's just magic to me
[00:43:00.840 --> 00:43:06.120]   Yeah, it's a miracle. Nobody knows how it works. It's like david copperfield. He made a house appear
[00:43:06.440 --> 00:43:10.680]   Sure, it took nine months longer and a hundred thousand dollars more, but he made it happen. Yeah
[00:43:10.680 --> 00:43:13.960]   It's magic
[00:43:13.960 --> 00:43:20.840]   Let's take a break stacey higamotham is here. I didn't really give you a good enough plug at the beginning iot podcast.com for her
[00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:25.160]   Show that she does with the beautiful talented and ever so lovely
[00:43:25.160 --> 00:43:27.640]   Kevin toful

[00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:47.960]   Now, you know how I feel every freaking day of my life
[00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:53.000]   Hard job, man
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:55.480]   Day baby
[00:43:55.480 --> 00:44:01.160]   Stacy also writes about iot and her very by the way highly recommend the newsletter
[00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:05.720]   And the site uh, stacey at iot.com. It's really good
[00:44:05.720 --> 00:44:08.120]   She is this one of the smartest journalists out there
[00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:10.600]   And if mike elgan still ran
[00:44:10.600 --> 00:44:15.560]   PC mag windows magazine, I would I would say hire this woman
[00:44:15.560 --> 00:44:19.480]   But he doesn't but I don't sorry instead
[00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:25.960]   Oh, what a life he travels the world. I do writes columns for computer world
[00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:31.480]   Uh fast company company see him on google plus on the twitter on the instagram and
[00:44:31.480 --> 00:44:35.640]   He and his wife amira have this thing at gastronomad.net
[00:44:35.640 --> 00:44:42.680]   One month away, I think I don't want to scare you from something it is terrifying. It was that's about that's about it
[00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:45.080]   We're taking over a couple of weeks to
[00:44:45.080 --> 00:44:52.760]   By the lives of the stuff Barcelona right so if you're watching paul tharats two weeks in bar cilona on windows weekly and thinking

[00:46:00.360 --> 00:46:04.200]   Uh learning how to make really good breads. That sounds so awesome
[00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:10.760]   It's gonna be a lot of fun and uh, we'll be streaming and posting and oh, yeah, I'm gonna try really hard to get to live it
[00:46:10.760 --> 00:46:12.760]   Like here. Yeah, yeah
[00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:17.240]   Excellent, but but not the good stuff. Well, we also we also hope uh
[00:46:17.800 --> 00:46:23.560]   We decided that we're gonna do some in sonoma as well sometime in the future. So oh, yeah, I can go to that
[00:46:23.560 --> 00:46:26.120]   Then I can get to exactly you know what?
[00:46:26.120 --> 00:46:30.840]   Stacey you in fact we're all good should come out for it. In fact, we're all gonna be staying at your house leo
[00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:32.200]   Okay
[00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:37.160]   You're okay. Well, I was I was looking at the mexico city one. There's no dates yet. So I have no idea
[00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:40.040]   We're gonna do that maraco proseco, italy
[00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:45.400]   southern france. Yep. Wow. I don't see proseco, italy
[00:46:45.800 --> 00:46:51.080]   It's not up yet. That's what i was going on a couple of days, but yeah, and if you um, yeah, it's
[00:46:51.080 --> 00:46:58.120]   I gotta say it next year. I turn 40 and I'm looking for a great event for my best friend
[00:46:58.120 --> 00:47:02.680]   That's great event. Well one of the things that for the nerd audience
[00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:07.240]   One of the things you can do what we that we can do is we can give people an experience that they couldn't do on their own
[00:47:07.240 --> 00:47:11.960]   So for example the house we're staying at in barcelona has gigabit fiber
[00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:15.560]   Connectivity try finding that try finding that
[00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:19.960]   We can do the shows from there. Oh my god. I can't believe it. Yeah, so
[00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:23.880]   We try to do that at all the places where we stay so it's
[00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:26.920]   Okay, nerd now now my mind is
[00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:29.720]   Yeah, just blown blown
[00:47:29.720 --> 00:47:32.360]   So is your friend turning 40 also?
[00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:36.680]   Where our birthdays are like 12 days apart. I've noticed i was 11
[00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:39.800]   So that's so cute
[00:47:39.800 --> 00:47:45.400]   So when I sat down and mike you'll vouch for this I sat down and I saw oh there's somebody at my front door
[00:47:45.400 --> 00:47:49.480]   What
[00:47:49.480 --> 00:47:55.960]   Uh, I guess it's a delivery. Yeah, we this is actually great. This is the ring video doorbell. It's a camera
[00:47:55.960 --> 00:48:00.360]   That is uh your doorbell. It's a camera microphone and speaker
[00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:05.400]   If they ring the doorbell it goes to an unknown on my phone and I can pick it up
[00:48:05.400 --> 00:48:07.000]   And say yeah, what do you want?
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:11.320]   Now that's nice for security because even if you're not home anywhere in the world you're on the internet your
[00:48:11.320 --> 00:48:15.320]   Doorbells on the internet so you could say I'm not here
[00:48:15.320 --> 00:48:18.520]   Which is great because burglars often will ring the doorbell first
[00:48:18.520 --> 00:48:21.400]   Wait, you'll see if you're home then go around back and break in
[00:48:21.400 --> 00:48:26.760]   This way you're always home even if you're not you can also keep an eye on those packages
[00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:30.920]   And since I get so many packages, this is a boon for me. I say yeah, just leave it there
[00:48:30.920 --> 00:48:32.760]   I'll be right out or whatever and it
[00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:37.080]   I don't miss packages and I know that they're safe because I could keep an eye on them with the ring doorbell
[00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:43.800]   But now rings gone in the next level. We knew this would happen when they got that big investment from Richard branson and his investor group
[00:48:43.800 --> 00:48:47.640]   We knew that that was just the beginning for because jamie simonoff the uh ceo is
[00:48:47.640 --> 00:48:53.480]   Really a creative smart guy. They've added a couple of things we've mentioned before their stick up cam
[00:48:53.480 --> 00:48:58.520]   Now they have I I love these the floodlight cams and this makes sense. You've probably already seen
[00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:03.800]   Certainly even had floodlights that light up when you come down the the side of your house or the back of your house
[00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:09.800]   They light up that's nice. That's a convenience. It has some security because you know it turns on burglars
[00:49:09.800 --> 00:49:14.440]   No, though people have automatic lights, but with the ring floodlight cam you also have the camera
[00:49:14.440 --> 00:49:15.800]   the
[00:49:15.800 --> 00:49:20.280]   Speaker and the microphone so you can hear them you can talk to them say yeah
[00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:25.800]   Can I help you that I gotta tell you if you're a bad guy you're walking behind a house and you don't want that light comes on
[00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:30.360]   And somebody says can I help you? I think that's pretty much it, but if it isn't if you get one of those
[00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:36.600]   Persistent guys there's a button on the interface you press that sets off 110 decibel alarm
[00:49:36.600 --> 00:49:43.080]   And they go run and run in it's so much fun. It's also great for you kids get off my lawn
[00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:48.520]   My lawn you know what I used to scare off the deer. Yeah, because they're always eating our roses
[00:49:48.520 --> 00:49:52.040]   Yeah, great time and I have a whole section in the book
[00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:56.680]   I'm doing a book on the on the gastronomad lifestyle and it's on the ring video doorbell
[00:49:56.680 --> 00:49:59.720]   I recommend that everybody who travels. Oh, you can spring it with you
[00:49:59.720 --> 00:50:02.440]   Yeah, I use mounting putty and I just put it there and I have it so smart
[00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:08.360]   It's yeah, because the original has a battery in it that you charge exactly so in that last year so you left forever
[00:50:08.360 --> 00:50:12.920]   Yeah, so this is great like for example when we were living in Mexico. Oh, that's so brilliant
[00:50:12.920 --> 00:50:19.720]   It was like it was fantastic and and they there are a lot of people who come door to door in Mexico to sell things like you get bottled water
[00:50:19.720 --> 00:50:21.560]   They're hawking at essentially
[00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:26.200]   And you don't know if they're like moonlighting is like, you know, maybe they're checking out if nobody's home
[00:50:26.200 --> 00:50:32.120]   Whatever, but they you can never tell if somebody's not home because when they ring the bell and you answer they assume probably that you're there
[00:50:32.120 --> 00:50:36.360]   And in any event you're getting video, but if you try this is not just for your home folks
[00:50:36.360 --> 00:50:41.320]   This is fantastic. That is so reliable smart idea bring it to your air B&B. Yeah, exactly
[00:50:41.320 --> 00:50:44.200]   They did this in Wilshire parka a suburb of Los angeles
[00:50:44.200 --> 00:50:49.560]   If you go to ring.com and look at the neighborhood section ring.com/twig and then click neighborhoods
[00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:57.160]   Uh, they gave not everybody but 10 1 and 10 homes a ring doorbell in six months burglaries down 55
[00:50:57.160 --> 00:51:05.800]   Percent so now they have a whole program called the ring neighborhoods beta. It's basically a digital neighborhood watch and you could be part of that
[00:51:05.800 --> 00:51:11.240]   I know isn't that interesting. Yeah, so uh, I have a ring on mine my some of my neighbors have
[00:51:11.240 --> 00:51:18.360]   Uh the ring as well. So we in effect and you have to give permission and they have to give permission, but I can see their doorbell
[00:51:18.520 --> 00:51:20.520]   Yeah, so uh
[00:51:20.520 --> 00:51:24.360]   It's it is a neighborhood watch. Yeah, it's really
[00:51:24.360 --> 00:51:31.960]   I mean anyway, uh go to ring.com/twig get started with a ring of security kit the doorbell of your choice in either one
[00:51:31.960 --> 00:51:36.360]   Two or three ring floodlight cams you'll get up to 150 off
[00:51:36.360 --> 00:51:39.800]   Find out more about ring ring.com
[00:51:41.080 --> 00:51:46.040]   Slash twig because we want to make sure that this week in google gets the credit ring.com
[00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:48.680]   Slash twig we thank rings for much for their support
[00:51:48.680 --> 00:51:54.280]   Uh, what else what else there's so many things to talk about today. We did fortunately get all the phones
[00:51:54.280 --> 00:52:01.240]   Should I set up aloe for the desktop? Uh, I was just gonna ask like so using aloe
[00:52:01.240 --> 00:52:04.200]   What what happens with hangouts
[00:52:04.200 --> 00:52:10.840]   Where so google make uh which already has the most confusing messaging
[00:52:11.480 --> 00:52:15.080]   Strategy anybody can imagine now has made it worse
[00:52:15.080 --> 00:52:20.280]   You'd think it's better because when I first read it I went oh good because one of the things missing from aloe
[00:52:20.280 --> 00:52:24.760]   One of many was the ability to use aloe on the desktop, right? That's a nice
[00:52:24.760 --> 00:52:28.200]   Uh feature because I use that in hangouts all the time
[00:52:28.200 --> 00:52:33.080]   I use it in apples messages if if I have a mac if that's the problem is you have to have a mac available
[00:52:33.080 --> 00:52:37.640]   But if you have a mac available or you do it on your ipad if you get a message
[00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:40.440]   Uh, you can respond. I don't like to type on my phone
[00:52:40.440 --> 00:52:45.560]   So actually we'll open up my ipad we're more likely my laptop and respond there same thing with hangouts
[00:52:45.560 --> 00:52:49.160]   So now aloe apparently so i've got all excited. Oh neat
[00:52:49.160 --> 00:52:52.120]   So, uh, you probably shouldn't show that on the air, but that's okay
[00:52:52.120 --> 00:52:55.960]   Uh, if I quickly sign up for it, otherwise everybody's gonna sign up for my aloe
[00:52:55.960 --> 00:52:59.720]   So so i'm gonna okay go to aloe
[00:52:59.720 --> 00:53:06.200]   Uh allow because what you're doing is you're connecting. Okay. Now you can show it because well, maybe not better not show it
[00:53:06.440 --> 00:53:07.800]   This you can show
[00:53:07.800 --> 00:53:09.800]   Uh, so what happens is
[00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:15.560]   Now that fired up a web version of aloe, but the problem is it's getting all the chats from my phone
[00:53:15.560 --> 00:53:19.320]   I have to be using an android phone aloe on an android phone
[00:53:19.320 --> 00:53:23.320]   If there isn't really a presence on the web you have to be using chrome
[00:53:23.320 --> 00:53:24.920]   Yep
[00:53:24.920 --> 00:53:29.800]   And really all it is is is a is a chrome based interface to aloe
[00:53:29.800 --> 00:53:33.400]   So now from now on I can bookmark aloe.google.com
[00:53:33.720 --> 00:53:36.360]   slash web and I have a web based interface to aloe
[00:53:36.360 --> 00:53:40.680]   But if my phone isn't on if I turn my phone off, I think it won't work
[00:53:40.680 --> 00:53:45.400]   I mean the ios support is coming soon. They say, uh, right now. It's only android
[00:53:45.400 --> 00:53:51.160]   But you know the thing so yes, it's super confusing that their whole message. Nobody understands it. Nobody
[00:53:51.160 --> 00:53:53.720]   Uh, well, they're close
[00:53:53.720 --> 00:53:57.320]   If you let it work with firefox if you let it work on the iphone
[00:53:57.320 --> 00:53:59.320]   I mean on a
[00:53:59.320 --> 00:54:03.160]   Macintosh it doesn't women. I can't use chrome on a macintosh to do this
[00:54:03.160 --> 00:54:10.040]   You cannot not right now. Oh, well, there is aloe you're an iphone. Yeah, the phone has to be an iphone
[00:54:10.040 --> 00:54:12.040]   It works at chrome. I'm sorry the anywhere
[00:54:12.040 --> 00:54:18.600]   Oh, but it doesn't work with iphones. You're right. You have to use the phone android phone for now and the the iphone support is coming
[00:54:18.600 --> 00:54:23.320]   So iphones so that's close and then there's one more step let it do sms messaging exactly
[00:54:23.320 --> 00:54:27.000]   That's the thing then it's a full service message, right and we can all move to it
[00:54:27.480 --> 00:54:31.800]   But but but and they haven't done that but if that happens and I hope it does
[00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:35.880]   the thing that's potentially great about aloe is the
[00:54:35.880 --> 00:54:40.840]   Assistance built in but but it's I don't know if it still does this because I haven't used it in a while
[00:54:40.840 --> 00:54:45.240]   But in the beginning it it was like it would interject itself into your conversations
[00:54:45.240 --> 00:54:50.360]   You'd be talking to somebody chatting back. It would so let's say i'm chatting with you and we did this I think maybe it was jeff
[00:54:50.360 --> 00:54:55.160]   I said, uh, hey, let's go to you want to go to a restaurant tonight and then it says we'll hear some restaurants
[00:54:55.160 --> 00:55:02.600]   Yes, and you can make a reservation right and it's fantastic and I want that so badly. I want I want google in my message
[00:55:02.600 --> 00:55:04.680]   I want I want
[00:55:04.680 --> 00:55:08.040]   To my conversations all up in my business adjusting things all up in it
[00:55:08.040 --> 00:55:13.000]   Because I because really that's the that's the future of how computers will work
[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:14.680]   They'll be listening and
[00:55:14.680 --> 00:55:18.360]   Helpfully suggesting things all the time now. Here's an interesting point when you're on the web
[00:55:18.360 --> 00:55:24.440]   I can't talk to the assistant. I have to type to the assistant. Yeah, that's not terrible. All it needs is SMS now
[00:55:24.440 --> 00:55:30.280]   Right, maybe right. Uh, I just like converted everyone over to hangouts
[00:55:30.280 --> 00:55:31.560]   I know
[00:55:31.560 --> 00:55:37.080]   And hangouts is only any good if you use google voice numbers or you're a fi customer
[00:55:37.080 --> 00:55:40.280]   Right because if you're not it doesn't do SMS, right?
[00:55:40.280 --> 00:55:45.480]   And right nervous I would be nervous about hangouts because I think at some point they're going to
[00:55:45.480 --> 00:55:49.880]   Sort of thought off of people who are not using well and then they created android messenger
[00:55:49.960 --> 00:55:54.680]   Yeah, which they said no even if you're a fi user you really should be using android messenger
[00:55:54.680 --> 00:56:02.760]   Oh, it's nuts. Yeah, it's nuts. Please google and people love messenger messenger is a really really great app
[00:56:02.760 --> 00:56:06.360]   Messenger messenger. Yeah, absolutely google messenger
[00:56:06.360 --> 00:56:09.560]   Which messes good good so
[00:56:09.560 --> 00:56:16.280]   Messenger is is designed so that it can be the default app on your phone for messaging
[00:56:16.760 --> 00:56:20.520]   Right when you get an android phone it can have messenger as the way that you do SMS
[00:56:20.520 --> 00:56:28.040]   and um a lot of people love it. Oh, oh, that's what I use you can what android messenger
[00:56:28.040 --> 00:56:35.720]   Surprise which messenger that messenger. All right, so I just created a selfie
[00:56:35.720 --> 00:56:40.360]   Uh, let me just uh, let me just chat and send myself a selfie
[00:56:40.360 --> 00:56:42.600]   of me
[00:56:42.600 --> 00:56:45.240]   Based on a picture of me. Does this look like me?
[00:56:46.040 --> 00:56:49.080]   I don't think so not really
[00:56:49.080 --> 00:56:54.520]   So that's a new feature hands up to your eyes
[00:56:54.520 --> 00:57:00.280]   It's binoculars. I think you're something who glasses and then it says for some reason. Sorry. I can't handle that
[00:57:00.280 --> 00:57:02.280]   Yeah, I can't handle it either. That's
[00:57:02.280 --> 00:57:06.040]   Somebody in the chat room said forget naming at google ala. They should call it google silo
[00:57:06.040 --> 00:57:14.280]   Good one chat room. Oh, yeah, it is it's android messages, but yes, that is that is a good app. It works
[00:57:14.600 --> 00:57:17.480]   Now good show title to remember when we were talking about rcs
[00:57:17.480 --> 00:57:19.080]   Yeah
[00:57:19.080 --> 00:57:25.480]   So yeah, that's one reason they want you to use messages because it supports rich communication services. Oh, why can't alo
[00:57:25.480 --> 00:57:31.400]   There must be why can't alo. I give you that and furthermore we talked about it
[00:57:31.400 --> 00:57:35.320]   Uh, this is the replacement for sms and the carriers
[00:57:35.320 --> 00:57:40.200]   You would think would be happy to replace sms that their days of making any money on it are gone
[00:57:40.200 --> 00:57:42.680]   They did make a lot of money on it
[00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:44.120]   but
[00:57:44.120 --> 00:57:48.040]   Most of the characters in many manufacturers aren't going to do it and if they don't do it
[00:57:48.040 --> 00:57:52.520]   Then what's it's again silo not alo. Yeah
[00:57:52.520 --> 00:58:00.680]   Okay, so our we want alo to support rcs. I would like it to support xmp remember g talk those with days. Yeah, right
[00:58:00.680 --> 00:58:03.320]   uh gee talk
[00:58:03.320 --> 00:58:04.360]   uh
[00:58:04.360 --> 00:58:06.360]   I would like it to support
[00:58:06.360 --> 00:58:11.960]   Every phone every desktop every browser. Yes, that's all is that too much to ask
[00:58:12.440 --> 00:58:17.000]   That's all what it wouldn't the world would not be so hard if we hadn't broken the internet
[00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:24.120]   Yeah, but what's so we've never figured out maybe mike you weren't here. We've debated this over and over and why isn't google
[00:58:24.120 --> 00:58:30.280]   Doing the obvious you and I and everybody else watching the show knows the right thing to do why are they doing?
[00:58:30.280 --> 00:58:35.480]   They have a bunch of weird obscure reasons for it and
[00:58:35.480 --> 00:58:40.920]   They just need to figure out how to just make it happen because they can but if they did
[00:58:40.920 --> 00:58:47.800]   It's not hard, but if they did everybody would use it if they had one so there's a few possibilities is like microsoft where they have different
[00:58:47.800 --> 00:58:53.960]   Fiefdoms battling and and neither one has a tendency. No no it's like game of thrones. They're all fighting for west roasts
[00:58:53.960 --> 00:58:57.720]   That's not what's happening. It's us. It's all under. What's his name? Um
[00:58:57.720 --> 00:59:05.080]   Okay, so if it's not that then are they worried about the carriers do they somehow need carrier buy and are they afraid of being too aggressive
[00:59:05.080 --> 00:59:08.280]   And then making the carriers unhappy
[00:59:09.320 --> 00:59:12.200]   Now they launched fiber that was that was a pretty
[00:59:12.200 --> 00:59:17.160]   Screw you carry on. That's a good point in google. Phi is also
[00:59:17.160 --> 00:59:19.800]   Screw you carriers. No, yeah
[00:59:19.800 --> 00:59:23.400]   You know what I would even be happy if they said well if you have to have phi
[00:59:23.400 --> 00:59:27.560]   That'd be okay with me of course. I have five. Yeah, I was
[00:59:27.560 --> 00:59:31.080]   But phi's very good
[00:59:31.080 --> 00:59:35.320]   It only works on google pixel phones, but frankly, that's the only andary phones. I really recommend
[00:59:35.320 --> 00:59:37.960]   I mean because of security
[00:59:38.680 --> 00:59:43.400]   Yeah, anyway, I don't it's so frustrating if you're a googler and you would like to explain to us
[00:59:43.400 --> 00:59:46.200]   Why you have this?
[00:59:46.200 --> 00:59:50.200]   Broken strategy on messaging. I would love to hear it because if you don't fix it
[00:59:50.200 --> 00:59:56.680]   Is facebook or somebody's gonna beat him? Well, you know the well facebook is just clogging everybody on users
[00:59:56.680 --> 01:00:01.320]   They got they've got what's app instagram facebook messenger. They're just as fragmented aren't they?
[01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:05.160]   No, but they have but each of their platforms has a billion users
[01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:11.320]   You know, I mean it's like they they have all the users and google has you know so few users and they could have so many
[01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:18.680]   I got a message in my like I got an email that was like somebody messaged you on facebook messenger and i'm like
[01:00:18.680 --> 01:00:23.880]   Screw that person. I'm not no no. I hate that I get a lot of them
[01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:28.280]   And the thing is on an android phone. You can use facebook messenger as your sms app
[01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:31.480]   So it does everything I know asking alow to do it's got desktop
[01:00:32.120 --> 01:00:36.840]   Well kind of quasi desktop. It's web based. I don't think that's the right desktop. Yeah, I like what's app
[01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:39.480]   Well, no, that's web based also
[01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:41.560]   Apples messages is a standalone app
[01:00:41.560 --> 01:00:48.280]   Which I really like right and iMessage is this is a lot of confusion around that iMessage is the service that apple
[01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:51.240]   messages the app messages is the app and
[01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:55.320]   And so you can you can use one or the other you can use it from the desktop
[01:00:55.320 --> 01:00:57.400]   But what you can't do is you can't
[01:00:58.040 --> 01:01:02.280]   Uh, I mean if you if you do want to communicate with somebody on android you have to do it through sms
[01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:06.840]   And they you know on the phone they turn green. I think it is it. Yeah green is for androids
[01:01:06.840 --> 01:01:10.280]   Right. Uh, well, it's it's for us a mess. It's for an out. It's for not
[01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:17.640]   iMessage and blue is for my message. So you know which way you wrote an article in computer world a couple of months ago
[01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:21.400]   Which just cracks me up google's myriad messaging apps. Which are best for you?
[01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:24.040]   This is all of the messaging apps that have
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:30.760]   Can you name these android messages aloe hangouts duo google plus inbox?
[01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:36.840]   Spaces is gone. It's gone. So we could take that where let me annotate it went down after this
[01:01:36.840 --> 01:01:43.160]   That's why i have its own messaging platform. It has sms. Oh, yeah, so we'll take that one. Yeah
[01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:46.440]   Uh, what's this one?
[01:01:46.440 --> 01:01:51.960]   I don't know what chat member chat like originally this is gmail
[01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:56.280]   That was another name for for g chat g talk. It's all the names
[01:01:56.280 --> 01:02:01.080]   This your phone app has messaging text messaging. Yeah and gmail
[01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:04.600]   I like this illustration. Yeah, it's like terrifying
[01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:08.600]   And then but the I think the biggest confusion is nobody's knows what's going on
[01:02:08.600 --> 01:02:14.200]   They they're turning hangouts into an enterprise thing right they're changing in a ways that people don't really understand
[01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:18.280]   Nobody knows what the road map is right and so it's like what do you use?
[01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:21.080]   You know you use what's app. That's what you use
[01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:28.040]   Um, it's it's a this is this is you quote a google spokesperson saying we've designed specific products for distinct use cases
[01:02:28.040 --> 01:02:30.760]   So we don't intend to have one app that does everything for everyone
[01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:33.480]   Yeah, which is a terrible
[01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:41.160]   Wait in an in an era of platforms and network effects that is the dumbest thing. I think i've heard i wouldn't you right
[01:02:41.160 --> 01:02:49.720]   Oh wow, okay. Well, okay. Okay. Okay google. Oh, don't say that. Oh, sorry. Sorry you guys
[01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:51.720]   You're gonna piss off alla
[01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:57.240]   My my bad. Hey, I have a really random and weird question that i'm just gonna throw out there
[01:02:57.240 --> 01:03:04.200]   Okay, why are all my icons on my phone? Why are all the little like shortcut icons? Why are they all blue?
[01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:09.480]   Like the majority of my phone icons are blue and I was just curious if there was like a reason for that
[01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:15.160]   Well, facebook's blue right so maybe they didn't met research that said blue is uh, everybody's but like
[01:03:15.800 --> 01:03:22.200]   The amma the the madam a app drop box. That's blue. Yeah, um winged nest my fitness pal
[01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:30.760]   Uh blue means iot because I don't look at mine my my phone is a very as a broad swath of lovely colors some blue
[01:03:30.760 --> 01:03:33.160]   You should ask your therapist
[01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:38.200]   Okay, i'm sure it means something why are all my apps blue therapist? Why?
[01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:41.240]   Why it's a call for help she's feeling so blue
[01:03:41.320 --> 01:03:46.280]   I have a user interface issue because sometimes swipe up does that sometimes it does that yeah, there's a lot
[01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:48.440]   There's a preponderance of blue
[01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:53.800]   I would say blue is the most favoriteest color. Yep, the most favoriteest most favoriteest color
[01:03:53.800 --> 01:03:58.200]   Followed by online. It's red red lot of red and then green
[01:03:58.200 --> 01:04:03.720]   And then green red green and blue that's pretty much it and then shades thereof
[01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:06.440]   Yellow there's some yellows
[01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:10.360]   Yeah, I don't have very many yellows at all sam sung likes yellow
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:17.720]   Snap chats google keep and you know me yellow you don't know me you have an app called you know me
[01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:23.320]   You know me. It's it's a iot. Oh, why is this yellow? You and oh am I?
[01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:26.040]   Y o n o m I yes
[01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:28.760]   Okay, I spelled it wrong
[01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:30.120]   That's okay
[01:04:30.120 --> 01:04:34.680]   YouTube is testing a very interesting new feature which I think is brilliant
[01:04:34.680 --> 01:04:38.440]   See we we we give us and we take us away
[01:04:39.480 --> 01:04:46.040]   YouTube testing a number on the video that you're watching that tells you how many other people are also watching this video
[01:04:46.040 --> 01:04:49.560]   You know this brings up another topic which is facebook
[01:04:49.560 --> 01:04:51.400]   TV
[01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:55.320]   And I got a glimpse of it the other day at my son's house and they
[01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:59.960]   What they're saying is that they're bringing social networking into television which is a brilliant idea
[01:04:59.960 --> 01:05:06.280]   Yep, and which youtube really needs to do and this looks like it might be a start of that but they show you all the chatter
[01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:10.840]   From everybody not just from your friends who gives a rat's
[01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:16.280]   Haini because you're in a larger community. I'm not I don't want anything to do with that community
[01:05:16.280 --> 01:05:18.680]   I you know if if somebody I know
[01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:23.160]   Comments on a tv show that i'm watching live. That's amazing. That's great
[01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:26.840]   And if the facebook's the only one that can do that because generally speaking
[01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:30.520]   They know your social graph generally speaking when you're in a chat environment like that
[01:05:30.520 --> 01:05:36.680]   You know our chat room. They don't know who you know don't know but facebook does think of the oscars or think of major
[01:05:36.760 --> 01:05:43.000]   news events where your friends actual friends that you know are you're all chatting on the screen that you're all watching that's
[01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:45.880]   Why doesn't somebody do that?
[01:05:45.880 --> 01:05:51.160]   Cool. Yes, that would be amazing. You know why they don't do it because unlike you most of us don't have any friends
[01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:54.040]   It would be really slow in there
[01:05:54.040 --> 01:06:03.640]   That's why there'd be one comment every hour, but it's something like game of thrones. What if we could all yeah, so to this point
[01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:09.640]   Facebook's investing how many how much money a lot of money money to do original programming, right?
[01:06:09.640 --> 01:06:14.200]   Apple just announced they're gonna spend one billion dollars, which I thought sounded like a lot
[01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:18.760]   Yeah, and then and then it said that's about 10 shows and that
[01:06:18.760 --> 01:06:21.880]   HBO spends twice that yeah
[01:06:21.880 --> 01:06:25.480]   And that netflix spends 10 times that yeah
[01:06:25.480 --> 01:06:27.160]   Yeah
[01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:29.240]   So i'll six billion six times that yeah
[01:06:29.240 --> 01:06:33.000]   Wow yep tv production is expensive. Yeah
[01:06:34.680 --> 01:06:39.160]   So leo's like i'm doing something wrong. I am I should be spending billions on this
[01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:40.760]   billions
[01:06:40.760 --> 01:06:42.760]   Millions why aren't I spending billions?
[01:06:42.760 --> 01:06:49.880]   So a billion dollars apple has demonstrated a complete inability to create content anybody wants to watch with the
[01:06:49.880 --> 01:06:55.720]   apps. Oh my goodness. Has anybody watched carpool karaoke? Yes, it's terrible. They've ruined it
[01:06:55.720 --> 01:07:00.680]   How could you ruin such a ease? It's easy. I'll tell you how they really did they made it super
[01:07:01.080 --> 01:07:06.120]   Longer yeah, it used to be this casual like you know camera in the car well it was a bit
[01:07:06.120 --> 01:07:08.520]   Yeah, it wasn't the whole show exactly
[01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:14.360]   But there's product placement in it and it's just it's just horrible and in the old show they had james cordon
[01:07:14.360 --> 01:07:19.640]   Singing and hosting yeah now there's no it looks like at least in the tea and the teas
[01:07:19.640 --> 01:07:24.200]   There's no host he does some of them and then sometimes he doesn't and that doesn't work either
[01:07:24.200 --> 01:07:28.680]   But for the most part it looks like just the karaoke or yours right?
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.400]   It's the two it's just right and long
[01:07:31.400 --> 01:07:35.880]   Right it's the two two in the car. Yeah game of thrones
[01:07:35.880 --> 01:07:40.200]   Yeah, it's like you know it's thematic in terms of who's in the car. Let me uh, let's see here
[01:07:40.200 --> 01:07:46.520]   It's just awful and this is from apple. This is and they have super high production values and that oddly ruins it
[01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:52.360]   Nothing. Oh, he's there's cordon in the back john legends driving lee Shaquise is in the shotgun
[01:07:52.360 --> 01:07:55.720]   Some things to sing because I think you can make any
[01:07:56.200 --> 01:08:01.560]   Statement this is more like the original. I john you first. Okay. Do you need a lift bro?
[01:08:01.560 --> 01:08:06.440]   Do you need a lift bro? Hey
[01:08:06.440 --> 01:08:08.840]   Okay, i'm done. Do you need a lift bro?
[01:08:08.840 --> 01:08:13.320]   I'm done. What you what you notice when you watch it is that it's it's more
[01:08:13.320 --> 01:08:18.280]   It feels more scripted more produced and simultaneously less fun. Yeah, exactly
[01:08:18.280 --> 01:08:23.960]   It's gotta be like this show. It's gotta be just like apple has demonstrated in an ability to create good content
[01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:29.560]   They have hired two people from holly wood eddy q is apparently at apple
[01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:35.320]   Determined to make this and if you think about it there is an upside because right now you have to be an apple music
[01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:43.080]   Subscriber I think you do you do so they could make some I mean this is like a hbo. This is a profit. Yeah, profit
[01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:47.720]   But you have to make content people want to watch will throwing a billion dollars at it change that
[01:08:49.240 --> 01:08:54.360]   I don't think so paul did you see that paul tharratt wrote about hands free calling coming to google home? No
[01:08:54.360 --> 01:08:56.360]   Oh
[01:08:56.360 --> 01:09:01.400]   Okay, she did it today. He didn't mention it to me and I was just talking to him
[01:09:01.400 --> 01:09:05.800]   Well, that's why I was wondering if you'll try it. Oh, it's rolling out today
[01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:12.280]   It's rolling out this week. So mine doesn't have it. So I was like, oh wait. I have to hold on here. I should have a home here
[01:09:12.280 --> 01:09:14.280]   Somebody bring me a home
[01:09:14.280 --> 01:09:15.880]   We have a home
[01:09:15.880 --> 01:09:22.840]   Jeff has a home. So the idea I know the idea was this was announced at google I owe some months ago
[01:09:22.840 --> 01:09:28.440]   That you and I thought this was a killer feature although the rest of his it works with phone phones
[01:09:28.440 --> 01:09:34.120]   Right, you're not just kind of laughed at me, but I thought this is disruptive. You can call any phone from your google home. Yeah
[01:09:34.120 --> 01:09:36.840]   uh free us in canada
[01:09:36.840 --> 01:09:41.320]   And I just thought that was kind of disruptive like everybody to do that
[01:09:42.680 --> 01:09:45.560]   But uh, okay, so that's rolling out. So anybody anybody home
[01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:49.720]   Fett yes, that's the geek says fetch me a home
[01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:55.800]   You can see how well that worked. Yeah, I don't say everybody's scrambling
[01:09:55.800 --> 01:10:01.160]   Oh wait, do we not have a home somebody came in empty-handed. I have several at home
[01:10:01.160 --> 01:10:05.480]   Yeah, and mine doesn't have it. I checked. I think everybody brought him home. Okay
[01:10:05.480 --> 01:10:08.120]   Would somebody say in the chat room would you try it?
[01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:10.840]   call leo
[01:10:10.840 --> 01:10:11.880]   and uh
[01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:17.160]   And uh, I'm what I'm also curious what what is the caller ID? They said it would be your number
[01:10:17.160 --> 01:10:21.240]   What did they say? I think they said it would be your number
[01:10:21.240 --> 01:10:24.920]   The call recipient will see either unknown or no caller ID
[01:10:24.920 --> 01:10:30.200]   Google says it will display your mobile number by the end of the year instead your mobile
[01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:35.640]   And if you're a google fire google voice user you can have it display that number now
[01:10:35.640 --> 01:10:39.800]   So I can have a display my google voice or five number, which is the same
[01:10:40.440 --> 01:10:43.880]   So I gave out my number and I realized this show will be downloaded
[01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:49.640]   And listened to by roughly a hundred thousand people over the next and they'll all be calling you over the next week
[01:10:49.640 --> 01:10:57.480]   I've just made my phone completely unusable. I thought will only be unusable for a you know a couple hours cloud cloud flare
[01:10:57.480 --> 01:11:00.120]   from the phone
[01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:03.320]   Huh
[01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:05.320]   No, you don't have to bleep it
[01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:11.960]   Oh, they're gonna bleep it. So only those of you listening live lee said the voice of reason right there. Oh, we're bleeping it
[01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:17.160]   Too bad I'm making it the title of the show
[01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:22.680]   Routing around the censorship running around the censorship
[01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:30.280]   Uh, so it turns out papa johns has tried something that's been a massive success ordering pizza on facebook
[01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:35.880]   TGI fridays started this letting you pay with your amazon account
[01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:38.840]   and papa johns
[01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:42.120]   Has now declared itself an e commerce company
[01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:46.120]   after delivering surprisingly strong results. Oh
[01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:49.240]   So, uh
[01:11:49.240 --> 01:11:53.880]   This is a graphic from bloomburg, which I I just like the name of it online and hungry
[01:11:53.880 --> 01:11:57.400]   Internet users who have ordered food delivery in the past year
[01:11:57.400 --> 01:12:00.420]   69.4 percent while I have
[01:12:00.680 --> 01:12:02.440]   Have you stacy?
[01:12:02.440 --> 01:12:11.080]   You live in Austin. I I order from like uber eats or from amazon restaurants. Okay. Yeah, I do that like weekly daily
[01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:13.720]   You do it mike. I'm sure yeah, absolutely. Can you do it in europe?
[01:12:13.720 --> 01:12:18.600]   Um, yeah, you can yeah, we have a lot of infrastructure here. There's grub hub and food learning
[01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:23.080]   There's dozens of they have you know, that's that's you can do that stuff all over europe
[01:12:23.080 --> 01:12:28.520]   Okay, but this makes sense. I mean like think about how I meshed people get into facebook and oh my god
[01:12:28.520 --> 01:12:33.080]   If you're hungry and you leave facebook and turn it off then your eyeballs are not being monetized
[01:12:33.080 --> 01:12:40.200]   But if you order pizza, not only do you not leave facebook but facebook's like see we're a legit platform that you know
[01:12:40.200 --> 01:12:45.000]   You should pay us to be on I guess it's actually in the ad you can see an ad for a pizza
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:48.280]   This is very dangerous for yeah, you see that for a pizza and you go
[01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:54.120]   And you click it and you can order it right there the company began accepting orders on facebook in june
[01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:58.200]   The feature was an instant hit hundreds of orders flowed into the first few hours
[01:12:58.760 --> 01:13:03.000]   Digital orders now make up 60 percent of popa john's sales
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:09.480]   Completely in a few months transforming their business into yes any commerce business amazing
[01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:12.920]   Pizza is a good one because pizza is a real impulse buyer
[01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:18.120]   It's the digital version of having something at the cash register and you're standing there and you're and you're like well
[01:13:18.120 --> 01:13:21.160]   I'll take it because it's hanging there at the cash register. I might go buy it
[01:13:21.160 --> 01:13:25.320]   um mcdonald's
[01:13:25.320 --> 01:13:27.960]   Has a mik delivery program?
[01:13:28.120 --> 01:13:29.880]   Using uber eats
[01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:32.360]   Yeah, this is this all gonna make us so much healthier
[01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:37.400]   Denny's started one. I just saw an ad for denny's ordering online
[01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:42.920]   But I don't think it's in facebook if I ordered before 430 can I get the early bird specials?
[01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:48.520]   I just think breakfast is not a great meal to deliver like a cold omelet's like
[01:13:48.520 --> 01:13:53.480]   It's interesting I read a review of a new restaurant in um, new york city
[01:13:54.360 --> 01:13:58.440]   That is created by some very high-end restaurateurs and chefs
[01:13:58.440 --> 01:14:03.480]   And the they have 10 dishes, but they're all designed to be deliverable
[01:14:03.480 --> 01:14:06.440]   You can go and get it brilliant and eat it
[01:14:06.440 --> 01:14:12.040]   But they've designed the meals in such a way that they should hold up in a cardboard container for half an hour
[01:14:12.040 --> 01:14:16.200]   That's why chinese food is such a great delivery food because it delivers so well and it reheats
[01:14:16.200 --> 01:14:21.240]   Yeah, you need to know except for the fried stuff the fried stuff that they steam in the free and it gets
[01:14:22.600 --> 01:14:29.720]   No crispy, but chop sui does pretty well. Yeah, any of the oh, yeah, it all's other stuff wet stuff yum
[01:14:29.720 --> 01:14:34.120]   Any of the wet food tastes great
[01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:39.080]   Well, I think it's interesting that there you can now have impulse
[01:14:39.080 --> 01:14:46.760]   Or impulse buying for food and and I think this this use is just going to be huge on on the the google home and the
[01:14:46.760 --> 01:14:51.400]   And the amazon echoes of the world because that's really how it should be I should be able to just say
[01:14:51.800 --> 01:14:54.600]   For all the pizza places, uh, just say, you know, I need a pizza
[01:14:54.600 --> 01:15:00.040]   Where do you want it from? I want it from this this restaurant? Okay. Do you want the usual? Yes? I want the usual
[01:15:00.040 --> 01:15:06.760]   Well dominoes has a skill and so you can do that with dominoes on your echo and maybe your frappy pizza
[01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:08.920]   Yeah, and and the skills
[01:15:08.920 --> 01:15:12.200]   Um, man approaches a crappy approach
[01:15:12.200 --> 01:15:17.560]   Well, you have to remember a lot of dominoes pizza. Yeah, but it's like, you know, there's there's thousands of them
[01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:21.160]   But it's like you have to remember it's it's almost like the command line world
[01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:25.960]   You couldn't use a DOS computer unless you memorized all the commands. That's right. You're exactly right
[01:15:25.960 --> 01:15:32.920]   And that's the problem with it. The the the ai should pick the skill for you. It will it will it will in time
[01:15:32.920 --> 01:15:35.320]   That's going to happen now. I will say
[01:15:35.320 --> 01:15:37.000]   um
[01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:41.000]   I don't consistently order any one thing from a place so
[01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:47.240]   Getting like right now the logistics of getting a menu and
[01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:50.680]   Do it there are very few places where I have a quote unquote usual
[01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:58.840]   Yeah, so that's don't lie. Don't lie. They have this stacy higgin bathroom sandwich, but it'll change
[01:15:58.840 --> 01:16:02.600]   I've always wanted a sandwich named after me and you can bath them
[01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:08.600]   I was I was thinking this stacy, but you know, I would also accept the higgin bathroom
[01:16:08.600 --> 01:16:11.080]   But I you can open face how much called the higgin bottom
[01:16:11.080 --> 01:16:14.440]   I went to salt lick and I ordered a higgin bathroom
[01:16:16.760 --> 01:16:19.240]   I have a side of higgin bathrooms and two stasis
[01:16:19.240 --> 01:16:24.840]   I like it, but but I think it'll change behavior though stacy because I think what'll happen is it'll be
[01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:29.720]   I think they'll they'll be like surprise me. It'll be like a blue apron or something like that where where
[01:16:29.720 --> 01:16:36.360]   Trust us. We'll send you like something you'll love and and you'll and people I think people would actually say okay. Yeah, that sounds great send it to me
[01:16:36.360 --> 01:16:40.440]   That sounds crazy. Well, that's what that's how the blue aprons work
[01:16:40.440 --> 01:16:43.400]   Isn't it funny because
[01:16:43.880 --> 01:16:48.040]   We thought remember how everybody remember your interactive tv
[01:16:48.040 --> 01:16:54.040]   Yeah, do you remember the cable companies wanted to do that that was the early convergence right interactive tv
[01:16:54.040 --> 01:17:00.920]   There were all these trials. There was a trip big trial in florida where they put interactive tv and all people ordered was stamps
[01:17:00.920 --> 01:17:02.360]   Yeah
[01:17:02.360 --> 01:17:09.960]   That was the big product with stamps, but they just somehow got it wrong because we now we order food online
[01:17:09.960 --> 01:17:13.720]   All the time. Yeah. Yep. What's the difference in blue?
[01:17:14.360 --> 01:17:19.480]   I don't remember having to use a remote control. I mean is painful. I believe yeah
[01:17:19.480 --> 01:17:26.360]   Yeah, in fact it would time in years to come we'll say having to type it in on a website is painful
[01:17:26.360 --> 01:17:30.040]   I know it is I go to we have a petaluma food taxi and you have to go through the menu
[01:17:30.040 --> 01:17:36.040]   It takes you just takes a while but it'd be so if because we'll say that's painful because what we'll really just do is say
[01:17:36.040 --> 01:17:38.600]   Hey echo. I'm kind of in the mood for
[01:17:38.600 --> 01:17:42.360]   I don't know you have any salads, maybe some salmon
[01:17:43.080 --> 01:17:46.680]   Uh and croutons. Yeah, or I want something spicy and you know
[01:17:46.680 --> 01:17:51.320]   And that's that's all it will mean walk you through it and and lead you to to something and uh
[01:17:51.320 --> 01:17:58.440]   But the difference I think nowadays is that it's not a new behavior actually to order something on on the internet
[01:17:58.440 --> 01:18:02.840]   We're doing it with all these other products. We're using it. Yeah, and we know how to do it
[01:18:02.840 --> 01:18:05.160]   We we feel good about our credit card and all that stuff
[01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:08.120]   So might as well throw food in there. Yeah, you know
[01:18:09.160 --> 01:18:16.120]   Bill Gates makes another massive donation. Wow, uh, he's running out of apple
[01:18:16.120 --> 01:18:21.160]   Out of microsoft stock actually he's not he's still the richest man in the world. That's what's amazing
[01:18:21.160 --> 01:18:27.560]   Yeah, that's what's amazing. Although jeff bayzos is now closer. Yeah. Well, he was the richest for a couple of hours for a minute
[01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:31.720]   Yeah, it's a funny. Yeah, I used to be the richest man in the world. He says for a minute
[01:18:31.720 --> 01:18:38.520]   Then my stock went back down bill gates is going to give five billion dollar he gives it to the billam on the gates foundation
[01:18:38.760 --> 01:18:45.560]   Yeah, uh, but he's but it's not his first gift. I mean they started the foundation with an even bigger gift 16 billion dollars
[01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:52.840]   Five billion dollars and that was in 99 in 2005 point one billion. This is now an additional gift of five billion dollars
[01:18:52.840 --> 01:18:59.560]   Uh, he it's the largest gift of 2017 although Warren buffet gave more than three billion dollars away this year
[01:18:59.560 --> 01:19:04.040]   So did michael. They'll give away a billion. That's kind of I you got to praise the guy
[01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:09.720]   They've given away billam will end up giving away 35 billion dollars in stock and cash since 94
[01:19:09.720 --> 01:19:14.200]   And he's still 35 billion and he's still the richest man
[01:19:14.200 --> 01:19:21.000]   Yeah, that's a lot of money. This is the you know, this is the magic of compound interest. Yes Warren buffet right say
[01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:24.680]   You get you get to a point where you can't give it away fast enough. Yeah
[01:19:24.680 --> 01:19:31.000]   And for Warren buffet to say I know I want to give my money away. I think i'll give it to the richest guy in the world
[01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.480]   That's that's who's getting my money me
[01:19:34.920 --> 01:19:40.520]   But i've said this about uh, zuckerberg. I I tend to not think that this kind of philanthropy is
[01:19:40.520 --> 01:19:45.640]   As as noble as it appears and that's going to sound like a horrible
[01:19:45.640 --> 01:19:50.680]   Certainly with mark it was a little weird because yeah, his wasn't exactly a direct
[01:19:50.680 --> 01:19:55.240]   But but but still gates is philanthropy. I think his is genuine
[01:19:55.240 --> 01:20:00.600]   Is genuine but the problem with it is that when you are when you after the first billion
[01:20:01.320 --> 01:20:05.160]   It's all you can there's nothing more that you can buy materially, right
[01:20:05.160 --> 01:20:09.320]   Um, so what you can buy is power and this kind of philanthropy gives him power
[01:20:09.320 --> 01:20:14.120]   He gets a decide deal. No, it is a big deal. He gets to decide that africa is going to go to gmo
[01:20:14.120 --> 01:20:16.760]   Like that's not something that afrokins are going to decide
[01:20:16.760 --> 01:20:20.840]   Bill gates is going to decide because he happens to personally like gmo crops
[01:20:20.840 --> 01:20:24.680]   And you know, he does it is not just personal. It is also research
[01:20:24.680 --> 01:20:30.280]   But I see your point his world is dictating most of what he does. I support completely
[01:20:30.840 --> 01:20:33.800]   But what but the point i'm trying to make is that there are all these
[01:20:33.800 --> 01:20:41.560]   Contested issues out there and what billionaires like bill gates and and zuckerberg are doing there's saying
[01:20:41.560 --> 01:20:43.960]   You know what? I I've bought everything I can possibly buy
[01:20:43.960 --> 01:20:47.000]   And now i'm going to influence the world to make the world
[01:20:47.000 --> 01:20:51.080]   Match up with my own personal beliefs and i'm going to crush other people's
[01:20:51.080 --> 01:20:56.440]   Initiatives with my money. I think that's way too much if you look at the stuff he's doing
[01:20:56.520 --> 01:21:04.920]   He's got small grants for things like bringing uh waste management to africa in places that don't have utilities his malaria efforts
[01:21:04.920 --> 01:21:07.480]   those are in
[01:21:07.480 --> 01:21:14.520]   All of this is backed by everybody's favorite data and he like his foundation does a really good job
[01:21:14.520 --> 01:21:17.400]   communicating with people in
[01:21:17.400 --> 01:21:24.200]   researching things it is not like a typical like zuckerberg's donation to the schools of new jersey that felt like
[01:21:24.920 --> 01:21:31.160]   I should suck and it was a mess and i agree with you and this is why this is actually precisely why warren buffett
[01:21:31.160 --> 01:21:39.640]   uh once uh bill gates to do his philanthropy because of that process you're talking about of of the vetting is very intense for any
[01:21:39.640 --> 01:21:40.760]   Bill gates always
[01:21:40.760 --> 01:21:46.200]   Power but you're always going to have people who get to make decisions. You can't have
[01:21:46.200 --> 01:21:51.640]   Total consensus. There's always going to be compromises and it's just a folly. It's it's kind of
[01:21:53.080 --> 01:21:59.160]   I don't know let me let me give you an example. Okay before you say I kind of understand what's what you're saying though mike because
[01:21:59.160 --> 01:22:06.200]   There are two ways gates could give away his money or anybody give away the money one is they could give it to an organization let the organization
[01:22:06.200 --> 01:22:12.360]   Decide how to distribute it. Mm-hmm. He does that too though. That's and if he does that's fine
[01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:15.720]   That's giving up the power and saying i'm merely going to give you the money
[01:22:15.720 --> 01:22:22.600]   Or you can hold on to it in your own personal foundation as both he and zuck do well buffett does not
[01:22:22.680 --> 01:22:25.240]   Buffett gives gates his money, which is interesting
[01:22:25.240 --> 01:22:31.320]   Yeah, so buffett's clearly not trying to influence the world unless he and gates are so aligned in worldview that he says
[01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:35.800]   Well, I want you to do because we agree but gates is and zuck both are saying
[01:22:35.800 --> 01:22:41.400]   Now we're going to keep the money. We're going to distribute as we we with our advisors and with our research see fit
[01:22:41.400 --> 01:22:45.640]   But your point is is well taken there he is still the guy who's deciding what to do with it
[01:22:45.640 --> 01:22:49.960]   I don't want to look a gift horse in the mouth and obviously nobody who's receiving his charity does
[01:22:50.840 --> 01:22:55.640]   But that is an interesting point is a very powerful. This is a tricky thing, especially in the third world
[01:22:55.640 --> 01:22:58.280]   So let me let me just give you a stark example from the past
[01:22:58.280 --> 01:22:59.320]   So for example
[01:22:59.320 --> 01:23:05.400]   There are certain parts of of northern africa that are that have occasional droughts and it's catastrophic for the population kenya for example
[01:23:05.400 --> 01:23:09.400]   Will have droughts occasionally or did in the past where there's lots of starvation
[01:23:09.400 --> 01:23:13.240]   some farmers in kenya
[01:23:13.240 --> 01:23:14.920]   actually
[01:23:14.920 --> 01:23:19.000]   Figured out on their own how to farm in a way that survived the drought
[01:23:19.560 --> 01:23:24.920]   But when you give like massive bags of grain, I'm not saying this is what the gates foundation did. This is just an example
[01:23:24.920 --> 01:23:33.240]   Essentially and give it away free to to kenya's what you're doing is you're running the guy who succeeded out of business and you're giving a foreign solution
[01:23:33.240 --> 01:23:34.520]   that
[01:23:34.520 --> 01:23:36.520]   What you should be doing is rewarding the guy
[01:23:36.520 --> 01:23:43.000]   The farmers who figured it out and having those ideas spread locally and have it be a local solution
[01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:49.160]   And and so there in africa is a particular problem because you know western organizations always swoop in and we're like
[01:23:49.160 --> 01:23:55.400]   We'll save you and and and it's like we should be doing a lot more listening to them those good farmers and kenya are
[01:23:55.400 --> 01:23:59.720]   Really know what they're a lot of them. I should also point out that the amount of money
[01:23:59.720 --> 01:24:05.880]   Even if you combine buffet gates in succuburg the amount of money. They're giving away just warched by government. Oh, yeah
[01:24:05.880 --> 01:24:08.440]   foreign aid
[01:24:08.440 --> 01:24:12.360]   And that is exactly why governments to foreign aid the number one recipient
[01:24:12.360 --> 01:24:13.160]   I think it's changed now
[01:24:13.160 --> 01:24:16.600]   But for years the number one recipient of foreign aid from the us was egypt
[01:24:16.760 --> 01:24:21.880]   Yeah, and that's from the why because right they were trying to get peace in the middle east
[01:24:21.880 --> 01:24:24.680]   Right on worse without helped and in other countries
[01:24:24.680 --> 01:24:28.120]   They're essentially buying off the leader to get to get them to play ball
[01:24:28.120 --> 01:24:34.120]   And there's and there's also economic reasons they want to benefit us corporations. So
[01:24:34.120 --> 01:24:37.960]   America at least has always used its trillions not billions
[01:24:37.960 --> 01:24:43.480]   In in in an effort to exert its will over the rest of the world
[01:24:43.560 --> 01:24:47.320]   So why wouldn't warren puffer or okay, sir. Mark's like right do that
[01:24:47.320 --> 01:24:50.600]   Nick built has a really good article in the vanity fair about
[01:24:50.600 --> 01:24:55.560]   Zuckerberg's ambitions for presidency. He says he's we've talked about this before he says
[01:24:55.560 --> 01:25:02.760]   Mark marks political ambitions are grander than you think he doesn't think he says he may run for harroff a someday
[01:25:02.760 --> 01:25:05.000]   I'm convinced he's running in 2020. Yep
[01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:09.320]   But but built in who knows mark lot better than I do
[01:25:10.040 --> 01:25:13.720]   Says he's preparing for the job, but he has other interests and one of them is
[01:25:13.720 --> 01:25:22.600]   He got terrified after the 2016 presidential election when he realized that how much facebook influenced that election
[01:25:22.600 --> 01:25:27.960]   Yep, and it's scared him and he's desperately trying to find a way
[01:25:27.960 --> 01:25:34.200]   A better way a way out. That doesn't mean him becoming president, but it does involve him getting kind of involved in
[01:25:35.080 --> 01:25:40.280]   What yeah, you know what's going on right and that's why he's talking to every people in every state
[01:25:40.280 --> 01:25:44.280]   Uh, not because he's ready for president. I I think nick is a smart guy
[01:25:44.280 --> 01:25:48.440]   Uh, he probably knows better than I do what as zucker burr exam bitions are
[01:25:48.440 --> 01:25:53.640]   I still feel like you might want to run for president, but I mean natasha
[01:25:53.640 --> 01:25:57.720]   Uh, I can't ever say her she's over at wire. Let me find it wired
[01:25:57.720 --> 01:26:01.000]   Google wired zuck president and see if
[01:26:01.800 --> 01:26:05.480]   Are these real? There's real debate now because he keeps making these moves
[01:26:05.480 --> 01:26:11.160]   Like hiring presidential advisors and and he takes pictures of himself on tractors and stuff
[01:26:11.160 --> 01:26:19.080]   Is this the one mark segway shirt? No, this is an older no why it's why people can't stop talking about zucker burr 2020 natasha tikka
[01:26:19.080 --> 01:26:27.720]   And she makes the point that running for president is so polarizing that as long as facebook is zucker burr is associate with facebook
[01:26:27.720 --> 01:26:30.440]   It would be yeah bad for business
[01:26:30.840 --> 01:26:32.840]   yet so
[01:26:32.840 --> 01:26:37.800]   Like it or not facebook is in the game. Well here's the day. Yes
[01:26:37.800 --> 01:26:43.400]   And that's why that's one of the reasons why I think this tour is kind of a big deal
[01:26:43.400 --> 01:26:46.760]   I also it has to be pointed out also that zucker burgs idol
[01:26:46.760 --> 01:26:48.760]   Is bill gates?
[01:26:48.760 --> 01:26:50.120]   Uh, and trust me that
[01:26:50.120 --> 01:26:55.640]   He I think that you know, he looks at what bill gates did which was that he shifted into philanthropy mode
[01:26:55.640 --> 01:26:59.480]   Suddenly at the peak of his career basically
[01:27:00.280 --> 01:27:01.640]   and
[01:27:01.640 --> 01:27:03.960]   Made the huge mistake of handing the whole thing over to steve balmer
[01:27:03.960 --> 01:27:11.880]   but um, but I think zuck probably you know wants to leave facebook when he's 40 or something, you know, I should point out that bomber
[01:27:11.880 --> 01:27:19.400]   Increased the stock value of microsoft by several orders of may or no but several times and thereby increasing bill gates wealth by yes
[01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:25.400]   So it wasn't such a mistake. Yeah, there are other metrics that they showed that you know, they the law is that better?
[01:27:25.400 --> 01:27:28.120]   Yeah, they could have done they should have done much better, but anyway the point
[01:27:28.440 --> 01:27:35.080]   I mean, I think zucker burg doesn't want to do this forever and and I think that at some point he and I would certainly would do this he wants to just
[01:27:35.080 --> 01:27:39.960]   Get out have get on a spending thing where he's extracting stock
[01:27:39.960 --> 01:27:46.040]   He's got a lot more facebook stock than gates ever had of microsoft stock. I think and do something so what's he gonna do?
[01:27:46.040 --> 01:27:49.400]   He has a lot more control president do this do that the other thing and he won't be part of
[01:27:49.400 --> 01:27:50.920]   So go back to our previous conversation
[01:27:50.920 --> 01:27:55.560]   And by the way, one of the things they changed the bylaws of facebook says that he could take a leave of absence to work in government
[01:27:55.560 --> 01:27:59.000]   Wouldn't lose his voting shares. Yeah, so clearly they're thinking about these kinds of things
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:03.800]   If you're right in saying that they want to exert their power by charitable contributions
[01:28:03.800 --> 01:28:11.960]   Again, think how much more a government can exert its power. Yeah with foreign aid. Yeah, so that's maybe that's the next step
[01:28:11.960 --> 01:28:16.680]   I don't think it wouldn't I don't think it's out of the it's it's a fun one to talk about and we'll know in a few years
[01:28:16.680 --> 01:28:23.800]   I think the landscape political landscape is going to shift dramatically over the next three years in very unpredictable ways
[01:28:24.600 --> 01:28:31.240]   I think we can all agree on that but but how controversial would it be if suck actually ran for president because you know
[01:28:31.240 --> 01:28:35.240]   Nobody knows what other facebook users see on their newsfeed
[01:28:35.240 --> 01:28:41.400]   They can control those algorithms to say and do anything they want and nobody this is this is one of the scary things about
[01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:45.400]   uh about the trump election which is that they were using this
[01:28:45.400 --> 01:28:49.960]   Jared Kushner kushner was using this company that
[01:28:50.840 --> 01:28:58.360]   Served micro addicts. Yeah, that served micro ads and it was all invisible under the radar because each individual was seeing an ad and then it was gone
[01:28:58.360 --> 01:29:00.360]   And like who knows what was actually happening?
[01:29:00.360 --> 01:29:04.920]   Zuck could easily do that. He doesn't have to run tweak the algorithms and he would be elected
[01:29:04.920 --> 01:29:12.200]   Facebook really does have that much power. That's what i'm saying and but so he that's why I don't think he can run because that would be so outrageous
[01:29:12.200 --> 01:29:14.120]   Oh
[01:29:14.120 --> 01:29:16.280]   Yeah, and america is so good at outrage
[01:29:16.280 --> 01:29:18.360]   Oh
[01:29:18.360 --> 01:29:19.880]   Yeah
[01:29:19.880 --> 01:29:25.080]   We wouldn't accept a billionaire becoming president. Well, yeah, of course not that would be ridiculous
[01:29:25.080 --> 01:29:27.560]   Let's nip that in the butt right now
[01:29:27.560 --> 01:29:34.040]   Okay, I think like like I said, I think we have entered terra in cognita for the last few months
[01:29:34.040 --> 01:29:37.480]   And I think it's gonna get it's getting weirder is by the by the minute
[01:29:37.480 --> 01:29:40.520]   And who knows what 2020 is gonna look like or even
[01:29:40.520 --> 01:29:45.400]   If they'll even be an election in 2020. Yeah, to be honest
[01:29:46.200 --> 01:29:52.040]   Well, the the the good news in all this is that trump is grossly incompetent. Yeah, that's pretty
[01:29:52.040 --> 01:29:59.240]   And so I don't think i'm apparent his uh his approval rating is very low and and probably stay that way knows worse than trump's
[01:29:59.240 --> 01:30:02.120]   mac crayon in france. Oh, yeah
[01:30:02.120 --> 01:30:03.880]   Yeah
[01:30:03.880 --> 01:30:09.560]   So I don't know. I don't know. I just uh, you know what? I don't know anymore. Yeah, I don't know anymore
[01:30:09.560 --> 01:30:13.880]   I do know this the doj has got to be stopped. They've just
[01:30:14.600 --> 01:30:16.600]   demanded information
[01:30:16.600 --> 01:30:18.440]   Yeah about every visitor
[01:30:18.440 --> 01:30:24.520]   To a website dream host which hosts the website is fighting this request
[01:30:24.520 --> 01:30:32.840]   The website which was a trump protest website which organized the protest. Oh, stop the auto stop with the auto play
[01:30:32.840 --> 01:30:37.960]   Which organized the uh, the the inaugural inauguration day protest that warrant
[01:30:37.960 --> 01:30:43.400]   July 12th says authorities will seize any information constituting violations of dc code governing riots
[01:30:44.360 --> 01:30:50.280]   Involve individuals connected to the protest on inauguration day, but what they're asking for is this massive
[01:30:50.280 --> 01:30:54.520]   Data dump of every single person who visited the website
[01:30:54.520 --> 01:30:57.480]   whether you were
[01:30:57.480 --> 01:31:04.840]   In dc or not that day including names addresses telephone numbers and other identifiers email addresses business information
[01:31:04.840 --> 01:31:11.080]   The length of service means and source of payment for services and information about any domain name registration about this website
[01:31:11.400 --> 01:31:13.960]   They want the the basically they want the logs
[01:31:13.960 --> 01:31:17.560]   This request is straight up banana republic stuff
[01:31:17.560 --> 01:31:25.960]   Well, it's just you protest against the president and the department of justice comes and says we want the name of every single person who visited this website
[01:31:25.960 --> 01:31:33.080]   Yeah, this is this is chinese communist party behavior now dream host is is gonna fight by the way dream host is complied
[01:31:33.080 --> 01:31:40.840]   With search warrants and legal processes, but at this point the site is called disrupt j20.org
[01:31:41.800 --> 01:31:45.800]   Uh, he said stream host says we are going to fight this
[01:31:45.800 --> 01:31:52.280]   Whether they'll win. I don't know whether the d oj will back down. I don't know. I'm glad that there's attention. We want to
[01:31:52.280 --> 01:31:57.880]   Increase that attention because of course this kind of thing succeeds in secrecy generally
[01:31:57.880 --> 01:32:08.920]   Well, interestingly they the the the quasi pseudo precedent for this was that they as under the guise of cracking down on election fraud or investigating election fraud from last
[01:32:09.320 --> 01:32:10.680]   election
[01:32:10.680 --> 01:32:17.960]   They sent a demand to the states every voter record and and most of the states said no thank goodness
[01:32:17.960 --> 01:32:19.720]   I think all the one yeah
[01:32:19.720 --> 01:32:25.480]   And so that was a good precedent and I think that dream host has got to say no if if they don't that's really really
[01:32:25.480 --> 01:32:31.160]   Bad. Yeah, well, we'll follow this. We'll keep an eye on it, but uh, that's scary. You should not
[01:32:31.160 --> 01:32:36.920]   They should not be able to get your name because you visited a website. I'm sorry. I even if it's the daily stormer
[01:32:36.920 --> 01:32:40.200]   I don't think that that's a yep acceptable at all. Yeah
[01:32:40.200 --> 01:32:42.760]   Um
[01:32:42.760 --> 01:32:48.200]   Let's see. I think we're getting towards anything. I've missed here. IKEA is going to do smart light bulbs
[01:32:48.200 --> 01:32:53.480]   Oh guys. I got my trodfi lights. They've already been doing them when it what do they call them?
[01:32:53.480 --> 01:32:55.640]   trodfi
[01:32:55.640 --> 01:33:01.240]   They're downstairs. What does that mean in in Norwegian or sweet? It was a sweetish anything sweetish
[01:33:01.240 --> 01:33:03.960]   They have those great names all their stuff has great names
[01:33:04.600 --> 01:33:10.680]   We just bought a mom bed for my daughter. Oh, I had a mom bed for my daughter. Love the ball bed. Yeah
[01:33:10.680 --> 01:33:15.000]   Um, yeah, so there you got it said what myself I said
[01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:18.520]   Oh, we we assembled it. It wasn't that bad really okay
[01:33:18.520 --> 01:33:22.920]   Yeah, it was doable. I had my brother into it. Oh, there you go
[01:33:22.920 --> 01:33:25.320]   Um next week if I were
[01:33:25.320 --> 01:33:27.960]   Well, I've tested it by next week. So
[01:33:27.960 --> 01:33:31.640]   Yeah, they oh, I guess what's new is that they work with home home kit. Oh
[01:33:32.360 --> 01:33:38.600]   It's not I don't think it's there yet that everyone reported it like last week that they were home kit enabled but they aren't
[01:33:38.600 --> 01:33:41.960]   Yet, I don't believe you you can use them with a echo though
[01:33:41.960 --> 01:33:45.720]   No
[01:33:45.720 --> 01:33:52.760]   They said they're getting home kit. I'm sorry echo and google home support. So yes, well
[01:33:52.760 --> 01:33:57.240]   I'll tell you what I'll tell you next week what works and what doesn't good
[01:33:59.240 --> 01:34:05.240]   Can you do it in Swedish or at least with a Swedish accent? I could do it with the Swedish meatball next to me
[01:34:05.240 --> 01:34:10.520]   These meatballs are good, especially with a little lingonberry jelly on the side
[01:34:10.520 --> 01:34:15.160]   I actually um, I made a prediction. I think a year or two ago and I I'm sticking by it
[01:34:15.160 --> 01:34:17.320]   Even though there's no hint that is coming true yet
[01:34:17.320 --> 01:34:21.800]   But I think that eventually light bulbs are going to be the location for
[01:34:21.800 --> 01:34:25.960]   speakers and microphones for for the google homes of the world and they
[01:34:25.960 --> 01:34:27.880]   Right because they're ubiquitous. They have power
[01:34:27.880 --> 01:34:33.240]   They're always in places where people are but they have audio light bulbs. I've seen speaker
[01:34:33.240 --> 01:34:38.280]   They have no they have tons. I have light bulbs with sensors in them. They they put
[01:34:38.280 --> 01:34:43.160]   Lux sensor so light sensors in them. They've put temperature sensors in them. They put
[01:34:43.160 --> 01:34:46.120]   speakers
[01:34:46.120 --> 01:34:53.640]   LEDs are not as hot. I guess they're away from the LED heat sink
[01:34:55.160 --> 01:34:58.360]   Don't I don't know why they're all doing but that's already been happening
[01:34:58.360 --> 01:35:00.600]   You're right in your prediction because it's been happening
[01:35:00.600 --> 01:35:05.560]   I would love to see google for example come out with with a home home light bulb
[01:35:05.560 --> 01:35:07.560]   No, no, no
[01:35:07.560 --> 01:35:14.040]   Don't don't get google into light bulbs because google should just grab the data from somebody else's light bulbs
[01:35:14.040 --> 01:35:16.840]   So who actually makes light bulbs? You only have so many sockets
[01:35:16.840 --> 01:35:22.840]   It's something I'm out of sockets. I have to unscrew things all the time. You don't want the pixel light bulb
[01:35:23.880 --> 01:35:27.400]   I do not I just got a home kit light bulb that doesn't require
[01:35:27.400 --> 01:35:32.440]   A hub which is really exciting. It's the savvania one that's going to ship in september
[01:35:32.440 --> 01:35:35.720]   So I can try that we can do a little light bulb show next week
[01:35:35.720 --> 01:35:43.080]   I'll have lamps y'all can compare. What do you think of this lift off which is a mobile app marketing firm
[01:35:43.080 --> 01:35:46.200]   did a study
[01:35:46.200 --> 01:35:48.440]   data gathered between june and
[01:35:48.440 --> 01:35:51.320]   2016 and june 2017
[01:35:52.200 --> 01:35:54.200]   They said that apps
[01:35:54.200 --> 01:35:57.960]   That have a subscription fee do better if they charge more
[01:35:57.960 --> 01:35:59.960]   Yeah
[01:35:59.960 --> 01:36:03.560]   Apps in the medium price range had the highest conversion rate
[01:36:03.560 --> 01:36:10.600]   The lowest cost to subscribe to acquire a subscriber at just over 106 dollars
[01:36:10.600 --> 01:36:14.280]   That's five times higher than the rate of people with 99 cent apps
[01:36:14.280 --> 01:36:17.400]   what
[01:36:17.400 --> 01:36:19.240]   Why
[01:36:19.240 --> 01:36:23.640]   Because people have no ability to understand what the value of something is
[01:36:23.640 --> 01:36:24.920]   Okay
[01:36:24.920 --> 01:36:27.160]   But if you put a price on it, that's the value and if the
[01:36:27.160 --> 01:36:32.440]   It's more 99 cents than it's a worthless piece of junk and if it's $20 then yeah, this must be really good
[01:36:32.440 --> 01:36:35.080]   But $50 is too much like there's a bridge too far
[01:36:35.080 --> 01:36:39.560]   Yeah, so for an app and this is sunk cost fallacy for a
[01:36:39.560 --> 01:36:43.160]   Monthly or yearly subscription it's a month per month. Yeah
[01:36:43.160 --> 01:36:47.800]   That's seven to $20 is the right. Yeah, the sunk cost fallacy
[01:36:47.800 --> 01:36:49.800]   the sunk cost fallacy is that
[01:36:49.800 --> 01:36:52.680]   I believe I understand it correctly. It's where you
[01:36:52.680 --> 01:36:55.480]   You pay for something and then
[01:36:55.480 --> 01:37:00.600]   You use it because you paid for it. I think and then because you're using it you keep paying for it
[01:37:00.600 --> 01:37:02.200]   So so if you
[01:37:02.200 --> 01:37:04.520]   If you don't have to pay for anything, it's easy and easy out
[01:37:04.520 --> 01:37:08.200]   Easy time easy go. No commitment exactly, but if you paid for it, you're like, okay
[01:37:08.200 --> 01:37:11.480]   I'm a user of this thing and I'm gonna keep doing it and I've already invested all this money
[01:37:11.480 --> 01:37:13.880]   And I'm gonna keep using it and therefore I'm gonna keep paying for it
[01:37:13.880 --> 01:37:17.400]   I think that's what I mean
[01:37:17.400 --> 01:37:19.400]   This sunk cost fallacy is
[01:37:19.400 --> 01:37:23.800]   Oh, she's looking up. She's a reporter. You gotta watch out for her. You can't
[01:37:23.800 --> 01:37:24.920]   I'm sorry
[01:37:24.920 --> 01:37:29.320]   This has been a very difficult show for me to do because I I am famous for asserting
[01:37:29.320 --> 01:37:31.560]   bogus
[01:37:31.560 --> 01:37:34.040]   Things and then Stacy will look at us
[01:37:34.040 --> 01:37:39.960]   Is you make rational decisions based on the future value of objects investments and experience?
[01:37:39.960 --> 01:37:41.560]   Okay, but
[01:37:41.560 --> 01:37:44.760]   us now you did describe a sunk cost correctly, but
[01:37:45.640 --> 01:37:50.840]   The idea is that you're a rational actor when you're making financial decisions, but really what happens is
[01:37:50.840 --> 01:37:53.880]   pricing changes things
[01:37:53.880 --> 01:38:00.600]   Pricing can influence you like anchor pricing and that sort of thing. Who's that behavioral economist? Oh, yeah
[01:38:00.600 --> 01:38:09.800]   Yeah, you know the TED talk guy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Everybody loves that guy. Nobody can remember that guy. Oh, I just I'm just old
[01:38:09.800 --> 01:38:12.920]   I know who you're talking about. Yeah. Yeah, he's got a funny name. Yeah
[01:38:12.920 --> 01:38:14.920]   uh
[01:38:14.920 --> 01:38:20.600]   Freakonomics guy no no the other guy he has been on their podcast, but yeah, no
[01:38:20.600 --> 01:38:21.720]   I'm the guy
[01:38:21.720 --> 01:38:25.640]   While we're thinking of that let us wrap things up because I gotta go to Disneyland
[01:38:25.640 --> 01:38:28.360]   with your picks
[01:38:28.360 --> 01:38:32.200]   Of the week. I'll start well you can look up and Stacy can uh, okay
[01:38:32.200 --> 01:38:36.920]   Can can begin here. You want you want my irrationally predictable. That's the guy
[01:38:36.920 --> 01:38:40.520]   particularly irrational. Yeah, and his name
[01:38:42.680 --> 01:38:45.800]   Ah, this is uh, this week in google. This is no place to be using google
[01:38:45.800 --> 01:38:50.440]   I could think this stuff I can this stuff comes to me, but my brain I think it's like slower as you get older
[01:38:50.440 --> 01:38:54.760]   But it's there. Yeah, it's in there dan erely dan erely yeah
[01:38:54.760 --> 01:39:00.840]   Oh, he wrote about traffic too. Yeah, he's great. I really I actually I think I've interviewed him. Have I interviewed him on triangular?
[01:39:00.840 --> 01:39:03.240]   Yeah, you have okay. Yep. He sorry dan
[01:39:03.240 --> 01:39:08.440]   He does experiments on trick-or-treaters and he offers them different if you can have the two these two candy bars
[01:39:08.440 --> 01:39:12.440]   You can have these actually that should be our pick of the week if you haven't read predictably or rational
[01:39:12.440 --> 01:39:15.640]   Erationally predictable. Yeah, it's a great
[01:39:15.640 --> 01:39:21.720]   Predictably irrational dan a r i e l y and he's stuff is really great. Check it us Ted talk. He passed away
[01:39:21.720 --> 01:39:27.160]   No, you're thinking oh john mintern Keynes. He says johnner intercanes. Yeah, he passed away
[01:39:27.160 --> 01:39:29.000]   Uh
[01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:33.080]   Pick of the way stay se hagan buffam besides the roller coaster. Yes
[01:39:33.080 --> 01:39:37.320]   Instead of a gadget. Yes. I have a brand new cookbook. Oh
[01:39:37.320 --> 01:39:39.640]   So way to dinner
[01:39:39.640 --> 01:39:45.320]   What's exciting about this is it I've been wanting to cook like one day a week
[01:39:45.320 --> 01:39:50.040]   So like plan out my meals for the whole week and then cook all in one day and save them
[01:39:50.040 --> 01:39:56.200]   Yeah, does that make sense to you guys? Yes. So that's what this book is about. So i'm going to open it so you can see
[01:39:56.200 --> 01:39:58.920]   So it gives you the marie condo of cookbooks
[01:39:58.920 --> 01:40:02.200]   Sure
[01:40:02.200 --> 01:40:08.760]   I'm just going yeah, that sounds great. So this this page you get a page that says like here's your man to hesser. I love her
[01:40:09.480 --> 01:40:12.040]   Yes, she's one of my favorite. Yeah, she was at New York times
[01:40:12.040 --> 01:40:14.680]   She is really
[01:40:14.680 --> 01:40:20.120]   Really a good I have her other cookbook. Uh, love Amanda has her. Okay. So what it does is it gives you
[01:40:20.120 --> 01:40:25.320]   I'm in the wrong section for my camera. It gives you like a game plan that says on the day that you're getting this
[01:40:25.320 --> 01:40:27.720]   So
[01:40:27.720 --> 01:40:30.200]   Now like you cook a roast chicken on monday
[01:40:30.200 --> 01:40:32.920]   And have shredded chicken on a tuesday
[01:40:32.920 --> 01:40:38.600]   Well, not exactly. So we did a week. I bought this last week. So you know
[01:40:39.400 --> 01:40:44.360]   There's some good things and bad things about this. So there's five dinners in like and she's got two dinners
[01:40:44.360 --> 01:40:50.040]   She and her co there's four dinners per season or four weeks of cooking per season basically
[01:40:50.040 --> 01:40:55.480]   um, and there's like five dinners in each one plus some lunches and they
[01:40:55.480 --> 01:40:57.560]   kind of
[01:40:57.560 --> 01:41:00.520]   the game plan is they tell you you're going to cook for like
[01:41:00.520 --> 01:41:05.240]   two or three or even four hours on a day and
[01:41:06.040 --> 01:41:10.120]   They give you all the instructions for the the cooking and they give you the grocery list
[01:41:10.120 --> 01:41:15.320]   And then you start assembling things and it should take about 10 to 15 minutes like last night
[01:41:15.320 --> 01:41:19.320]   We assembled one that I had pre-made the the tomato
[01:41:19.320 --> 01:41:22.840]   Compote kind of thing that it's not a compote. It's uh
[01:41:22.840 --> 01:41:30.120]   I roasted some tomatoes like uh two cups of tomatoes basically. Yeah, actually no it was 12 cups of tomatoes
[01:41:30.120 --> 01:41:32.440]   I know so
[01:41:32.440 --> 01:41:37.880]   The one thing is when you're cooking you cook more because you're cooking for a week. You're cooking a ton. Right. So
[01:41:37.880 --> 01:41:42.920]   That's why they sell all this all these like jars and bond things to
[01:41:42.920 --> 01:41:50.280]   Yes, I we had a hard time like putting like I was definitely running out of Tupperware containers for everything
[01:41:50.280 --> 01:41:53.480]   So I always wanted I'm gonna buy these tiffins
[01:41:53.480 --> 01:41:58.200]   These are the in India. This is your lunchbox. Oh, yeah. I always wanted these
[01:41:58.200 --> 01:42:01.080]   Look at that. Yeah, they're cool. Yeah
[01:42:02.360 --> 01:42:03.400]   So
[01:42:03.400 --> 01:42:07.800]   Three tiffins that's what I'm oh look at that. Can you get one with wheels on it?
[01:42:07.800 --> 01:42:11.320]   You need it on this one
[01:42:11.320 --> 01:42:15.800]   Okay, sorry. I just I got distracted at food 52.com. Go ahead
[01:42:15.800 --> 01:42:21.240]   Okay
[01:42:21.240 --> 01:42:25.400]   Um, so the the time this is bearing out the google memo because
[01:42:25.400 --> 01:42:31.160]   You're interested in the food and the recipes. I'm interested in the gadgets that go along with it
[01:42:31.880 --> 01:42:39.400]   Go ahead. Okay. No, you're interrupting me. I am. I'm like
[01:42:39.400 --> 01:42:42.680]   There we go. Go ahead
[01:42:42.680 --> 01:42:45.880]   It's okay. I mean if it's not interesting, I don't have to go
[01:42:45.880 --> 01:42:48.120]   No, please. I'm fascinated
[01:42:48.120 --> 01:42:52.760]   Uh, but I'm like I'm trying to review this cookbook here
[01:42:52.760 --> 01:43:00.600]   Um the time it gives you for cooking is like a little off. So you're gonna probably spend more time in the kitchen
[01:43:01.720 --> 01:43:04.920]   You might also like it makes enough for four people
[01:43:04.920 --> 01:43:09.640]   In these recipes you get a lot of food. We have three people in our house and I think
[01:43:09.640 --> 01:43:13.000]   So blue apron help there's so much food. Yeah
[01:43:13.000 --> 01:43:14.760]   um
[01:43:14.760 --> 01:43:17.640]   But it's really nice not to have to think about dinner
[01:43:17.640 --> 01:43:20.600]   so
[01:43:20.600 --> 01:43:24.760]   I don't know if I would do this every week, but there are definitely some weeks that I'm like
[01:43:24.760 --> 01:43:30.120]   I'm gonna try. Yeah, so and there's there's sites on this online that you know
[01:43:30.120 --> 01:43:34.280]   But I I kind of like cooking from a cookbook because I I'm old school that way
[01:43:34.280 --> 01:43:41.720]   So they also have a podcast. Did you know that the food 52 podcast? It's called burnt toast
[01:43:41.720 --> 01:43:45.400]   Yes, yeah
[01:43:45.400 --> 01:43:50.680]   So yeah, you can listen to that podcast while you cook because you're gonna be at the kitchen a really long time
[01:43:50.680 --> 01:43:54.760]   This is a great time to catch up on all your podcasts actually if you don't you're gonna be really hungry
[01:43:54.760 --> 01:43:59.560]   Uh, okay. Good. This is good. I like I'm ordering the book right now. Thank you
[01:43:59.640 --> 01:44:05.640]   Good, I think Michael is also a good recommendation. Yeah, it's awesome and I um can I go? Yes, go
[01:44:05.640 --> 01:44:10.360]   All right. I have a quick question for you stacy, which is that you're you have a june oven, right?
[01:44:10.360 --> 01:44:16.360]   And didn't they just come out with a new one? I'm so mad. It's the june feel about the june pro
[01:44:16.360 --> 01:44:18.840]   um
[01:44:18.840 --> 01:44:24.280]   I it's a built-in though. Right. It's not like oh like was I I was not going to
[01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:29.960]   Take out one of my existing ovens to put the june in if I were building a house and I had bought a june
[01:44:29.960 --> 01:44:32.200]   I'd be sad, but that's a pretty small people
[01:44:32.200 --> 01:44:36.440]   It costs a little more too. It's two thousand dollars 2 000
[01:44:36.440 --> 01:44:40.120]   But it's a it's a wall unit. It's an oven and so yeah, it's
[01:44:40.120 --> 01:44:42.680]   Is it is it bigger than the june?
[01:44:42.680 --> 01:44:49.160]   It is the same size. I believe oh interesting. I think that this is actually a good idea because the june really is your second oven
[01:44:49.160 --> 01:44:51.320]   Yeah, it is. Yeah
[01:44:51.320 --> 01:44:54.120]   And I I mean I use my june oven
[01:44:54.680 --> 01:44:56.120]   and
[01:44:56.120 --> 01:45:01.560]   Almost I mean not every night not this week because I pre-made everything but I mean we use our june oven almost every day
[01:45:01.560 --> 01:45:03.000]   Yeah
[01:45:03.000 --> 01:45:09.800]   And it I mean we even use it to toast our eggle waffles and they taste better. They do taste better everything tastes better
[01:45:09.800 --> 01:45:13.560]   Like how does that even happen? So
[01:45:13.560 --> 01:45:18.200]   All right, so okay. Okay. Okay. So my
[01:45:18.200 --> 01:45:23.480]   Tool of the week is something called meeting bird. I don't know if you've ever talked about this on the show
[01:45:23.480 --> 01:45:27.000]   I don't know about meeting bird is a chrome plugin
[01:45:27.000 --> 01:45:34.760]   That unites and integrates google calendar with both gmail and inbox. Oh, I need it. Yes, you do
[01:45:34.760 --> 01:45:38.280]   It's fantastic. Basically what it one of the things it does is it puts
[01:45:38.280 --> 01:45:45.000]   A bit of calendar on the side of your email package and when you open up an email where you're discussing a meeting
[01:45:45.000 --> 01:45:51.000]   It auto populates the calendar on the date with the information and the name and the person's phone number and all that stuff
[01:45:51.080 --> 01:45:54.600]   And it just says do you want to schedule this you click one button and it's scheduled on your calendar
[01:45:54.600 --> 01:45:58.840]   You can it you can toggle between your calendars. This is great
[01:45:58.840 --> 01:46:03.560]   You can talk toggle between time zones. You can set up teams. So you say here's my team
[01:46:03.560 --> 01:46:08.280]   Here's the here's the marketing team and you can have all the people in there and it knows what time zones they're in
[01:46:08.280 --> 01:46:11.880]   It knows what they're you know, what's going on with them. It's really fantastic
[01:46:11.880 --> 01:46:18.120]   But the best thing of all is the contextual jumping it like if there's any mention of a date and an email it
[01:46:19.240 --> 01:46:22.200]   The calendar part of it says do you want to go to this date?
[01:46:22.200 --> 01:46:24.360]   You click the button and you're on that date looking at that date
[01:46:24.360 --> 01:46:27.800]   So it's very very easy to use google calendar from email
[01:46:27.800 --> 01:46:34.920]   And really google should just buy these guys and integrate this functionality because it's just brilliant and uh, it's a cost anything
[01:46:34.920 --> 01:46:40.600]   I don't think so I know there's a free tier, but um, I'm signing up right now
[01:46:40.600 --> 01:46:43.800]   Yeah, but it's in addition to the integration it also
[01:46:44.520 --> 01:46:50.360]   You go to meeting bird instead of google calendar and it shows you you google calendar within meeting bird and it's a better interface
[01:46:50.360 --> 01:46:55.640]   It's more pleasant. It's more functional. It has all kinds of uh cool features. It's it's more
[01:46:55.640 --> 01:46:59.240]   Aish, you know, it's like figuring things out for you
[01:46:59.240 --> 01:47:01.720]   Um, it's just though if you use
[01:47:01.720 --> 01:47:08.520]   Either one of google's email packages and google calendar. You will absolutely love meeting bird. It's really really a good
[01:47:08.520 --> 01:47:11.400]   Sign up today
[01:47:11.960 --> 01:47:19.000]   Yeah, well, I I saw I saw a story somewhere that google was updating google calendar. Yeah, that's true supposedly uh updated
[01:47:19.000 --> 01:47:21.000]   I haven't seen it. I haven't seen any
[01:47:21.000 --> 01:47:26.840]   Changes how update how what I think they redesigned. I don't i'm not sure if they did it on the
[01:47:26.840 --> 01:47:28.920]   I should know this
[01:47:28.920 --> 01:47:30.040]   Let me see here
[01:47:30.040 --> 01:47:36.040]   So my pick of the week is something that I am not going to do but I want you to do it so you can tell me if it makes any sense
[01:47:36.040 --> 01:47:41.800]   I heard about this it was weird. I heard about this on yesterday on TNT and I thought what
[01:47:41.800 --> 01:47:46.120]   Are they talking about and then I saw more it's called movie pass
[01:47:46.120 --> 01:47:50.200]   $10 a month actually 995 a month
[01:47:50.200 --> 01:47:56.040]   And you can see as many movies you want up to one a day for 30 days
[01:47:56.040 --> 01:48:02.920]   You can't see 3d which is fine. I don't care. I don't like you have to have a uh, uh, debit card, right?
[01:48:02.920 --> 01:48:06.120]   You buy the tickets and then you get re re re
[01:48:06.120 --> 01:48:10.920]   Reimburst right or it gets reversed the charge gets reversed or something. I think it's brilliant
[01:48:11.480 --> 01:48:13.480]   It's wait. Didn't they threat to sue them?
[01:48:13.480 --> 01:48:15.320]   Uh
[01:48:15.320 --> 01:48:18.600]   AMC threatened to sue them. Well, don't use them at AMC then
[01:48:18.600 --> 01:48:22.680]   Sorry, I'm like wait a second. Yeah, AMC has filed a lawsuit
[01:48:22.680 --> 01:48:25.160]   Uh, I don't know how they can because
[01:48:25.160 --> 01:48:29.800]   From the movie theater's point of view. It doesn't look any different. You're still going in there
[01:48:29.800 --> 01:48:32.200]   right
[01:48:32.200 --> 01:48:35.080]   And buying the movie and they get the full money right?
[01:48:35.080 --> 01:48:37.880]   Movie pass refunds you the cost
[01:48:38.840 --> 01:48:43.000]   I think the theory I don't understand it at all. The theory is
[01:48:43.000 --> 01:48:46.520]   The gym membership most people won't use it
[01:48:46.520 --> 01:48:52.600]   But if you go to one movie a month it will pay for itself, but the you know, I think that
[01:48:52.600 --> 01:48:59.400]   It it's like if you go to the movie if you've been to the movie theaters recently unless you're going to a really hot movie
[01:48:59.400 --> 01:49:03.960]   The theaters are almost empty. This is good for watching at home. Right more bodies and seats
[01:49:03.960 --> 01:49:06.520]   makes the theater going experience
[01:49:07.160 --> 01:49:11.000]   Good as long as there are available seats for other people. How is this possible?
[01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:19.960]   I mean really they think most people won't even go to one movie. I think they're monetizing with data
[01:49:19.960 --> 01:49:22.440]   Oh
[01:49:22.440 --> 01:49:24.440]   They're selling some data to the
[01:49:24.440 --> 01:49:28.760]   companies or something like they finally oh saw these four movies. Yeah
[01:49:28.760 --> 01:49:31.720]   Uh, they were charging $30 a month
[01:49:32.600 --> 01:49:39.960]   Then I can see how that might not that's right on the edge. Yeah, but if they charge $10 a month. Yeah, it's so low
[01:49:39.960 --> 01:49:42.120]   I can't
[01:49:42.120 --> 01:49:48.040]   I mean now it depends where you live, but here in the bay area a movie ticket and it's like 13 bucks
[01:49:48.040 --> 01:49:51.720]   Yeah, so you're saving immediately, right? You just have to go to one movie a month
[01:49:51.720 --> 01:49:57.400]   Okay. Well anyway, I'm gonna pass that along to you movie pass.com the site is
[01:49:57.400 --> 01:50:01.800]   They need cloud flare. Yeah, this site is so slow
[01:50:02.200 --> 01:50:07.560]   Because I think it's like well who wouldn't do this right? They had over a million hits yesterday
[01:50:07.560 --> 01:50:12.600]   Or million. I'm sorry millions of hits. Yes. I can't get on the hit on this on the site now to show it
[01:50:12.600 --> 01:50:16.760]   Variety actually has a really good article talking to them
[01:50:16.760 --> 01:50:21.400]   So if you if you want to learn the history the current status and everything else
[01:50:21.400 --> 01:50:24.840]   And this is a guy who worked at netflix in the early days
[01:50:24.840 --> 01:50:29.400]   So he's not you know, he's not like somebody out of nowhere
[01:50:30.840 --> 01:50:33.880]   But why not I still understand why amc hates this so much, but
[01:50:33.880 --> 01:50:37.000]   anyway
[01:50:37.000 --> 01:50:39.000]   Yeah, the amc is gonna sue him
[01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:41.560]   probably because people
[01:50:41.560 --> 01:50:45.240]   It just it just makes the actual price of regular movies, right?
[01:50:45.240 --> 01:50:51.800]   Seems so high, but remember that unless I'm mistaken the movie theater doesn't make money off the ticket that goes to the the
[01:50:51.800 --> 01:50:54.840]   Movie producer they make money on the concessions
[01:50:54.840 --> 01:50:57.560]   after opening day
[01:50:57.560 --> 01:50:58.680]   they make money
[01:50:58.680 --> 01:50:59.640]   so
[01:50:59.640 --> 01:51:07.240]   After opening the first that's why opening weekend so big is because most or all of the proceeds go to the producer
[01:51:07.240 --> 01:51:09.720]   but then there's a split after
[01:51:09.720 --> 01:51:16.600]   The first weekend I believe or that's how I mean, that's how it used to be. I assume it's still sort of something like that
[01:51:16.600 --> 01:51:20.600]   Well, I want to you know what let's try to get the this guy in
[01:51:20.600 --> 01:51:23.720]   And and ask him what the hell?
