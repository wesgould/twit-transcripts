[00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.920]   where we cover the latest news, not just from Google but from the cloud, from the
[00:01:53.920 --> 00:02:00.560]   Googleverse, from anywhere in the world including ex-ampovals. That's where Mike
[00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:06.840]   Elgin joins us from. Yes and it is it is lovely here. The weather is wonderful and
[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.720]   the wine and the cheese is fantastic. And not only that, the other fantastic thing
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.920]   is nougats. Oh look at that. I've been testing nougats and I tell you it's a
[00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.720]   very rich and full-bodied operating system. That's a hefty chunk of nougat you got there,
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.680]   Mr. Elgin. We discovered that this piece of the woman who sold this to us
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.920]   hacked off this piece and we found out how much it cost. This is more than 50
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.520]   bucks right now. Why did you not ask for a smaller
[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.240]   chunk? Because I didn't know it would cost as much. You know we figure how much could
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:44.560]   it possibly cost. Oh but it is delicious isn't it? Oh yeah but this is made with
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.600]   honey and this is the really hard for kind of a caramel flavor. It's so delicious.
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.720]   I remember when I was a little kid like 11 years old going to the south of
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:59.400]   France and there's some town that's like Nougat town. Yeah and and I've told
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.560]   this story before there was like Nougat everywhere even the gas station sold Nougat
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.980]   and oh I love Nougat. Oh yeah I had never tried it other than you know the
[00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.440]   what Americans don't eat it. Yeah Americans don't eat it.
[00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.840]   At the bottom of whatever candy bars. It's good and by the way it looks like
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:20.640]   you've got great internet. Are you at an Airbnb? I'm at an Airbnb and it really is
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.200]   great but you know the we're in the old part of the city so this is a very old
[00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.960]   building. You can tell because all the plumbing and electricity is external
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:32.760]   nothing goes through the walls and so I was around the corner and the
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.720]   internet connectivity was a fraction of what it is right here within sort of
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.440]   line of sight with the with the Wi-Fi. The signal doesn't really go through
[00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.880]   the walls here which I discovered right before the show was not good enough
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.800]   until I actually came into this room. Sit in the window. Well good. We're thrilled
[00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.480]   to have you. I'm glad to be here. Our digital nomad Mike Elgin also with us
[00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.560]   Jeff Jarvis back from his digital John Socks. You've been back for a while
[00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.920]   which is nice. Yeah once. Buzzmachine.com the author of what would Google do and
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:09.160]   geek-sparing gifts and Professor of Journalism at CUNY and from Austin, Texas
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:15.280]   where it must be 150 degrees right now. Stacey Higgin. Is it? Is it not? It's 101.
[00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:24.000]   And humid. So yes. Do you have to have AC if you live there? Oh God yes. Yeah yeah
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.920]   because you're not even glowing. You're just you just look calm, cool, collected.
[00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:33.080]   Yes it is a it is a cool 77 in here. Nice. Actually that would be hot for me.
[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:39.360]   Okay well I'm a lady and we I guess we're men sweat. What is it? Horses sweat men
[00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:44.520]   perspire women simply glow. Oh I thought we glistened. No glow. I don't know. I
[00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.880]   believe it's a pretty antiquated statement. I think it would be considered
[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:54.080]   politically incorrect these days to repeat that. Women can sweat too. Women's and
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.200]   as a matter of fact I've as I've learned since I learned that as a child women
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:04.840]   sweat. And it's a good thing. Sweating's good. Sweating's great. It feels great to
[00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.520]   sweat. And if you don't sweat in the summer you're not doing so you're not
[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:13.000]   you're not you're sitting on the couch. You're not playing Pokemon Go. Have you
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   caught the the infection Stacey and your child? I have not my child doesn't have
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.560]   a smartphone so we haven't been playing it. I was gonna load it. She's she's only
[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.520]   nine. We can talk about when to get her a smartphone actually that's that's a
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:33.720]   question isn't it? Yeah but yeah and I went to download it the servers were
[00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:37.040]   not working so at that was at that point in time and then I just kind of gave up.
[00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:41.800]   I'm lame. I'm sorry I could have like cleaned up in Maine too. Oh it's so funny
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:49.000]   it's the greatest game but the servers are incessantly down today was the day
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.720]   it was supposed to launch in Japan of course the country from which Pokemon
[00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:59.040]   emerged and the most Pokemon go Pokemon crazy country in the world and we knew
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:04.520]   the servers would be devastated. They delayed it saying partly because of the
[00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:08.680]   leak the I guess this would have was gonna be the first test of sponsored
[00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:12.440]   Pokey Stop locations McDonald's was going to have Pokey stops at all the
[00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:16.920]   McDonald's the email about that leaked detect crunch and
[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:21.360]   Niantic the company that makes Pokemon go said they are not gonna put it out
[00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.800]   today to everybody's great relief although I'm wondering if they end up
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:33.520]   doing it because it is down down down John Hanke who's the CEO of Niantic said
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:36.640]   we are not gonna put it in Japan until we believe the servers can handle the
[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:42.920]   traffic. It's a bad thing for Google Cloud man it's looking yeah yeah cuz it's
[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:48.920]   all cloud it's all Google Cloud so in it I have no idea how it's architected or
[00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:53.920]   anything but I am I'm very curious to see what the cause is we've been trying
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:57.640]   to find out I've read articles one article said that they are working on
[00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:03.320]   Google and Coke what is it code engine cloud engine cloud engine and then but
[00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:09.200]   then it pulls from Google Maps but we're you know on Saturday on the new
[00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:12.320]   screensavers we've got a network engineer who doesn't have direct
[00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:15.280]   knowledge of it but who can speculate a little bit about what the issues are
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:20.560]   and why it's so hard to scale. Well there's a lot of I mean you've got the
[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:24.560]   real time back and forth on what can be kind of shoddy connections depending on
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:29.040]   where you are and then you've also got pulling from different aspects of Google
[00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:34.080]   services right so there's a there's a lot of back and forth there. I know and
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:38.640]   it's very frustrating because I see a jigglypuff but I can't get it. You know
[00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:45.040]   how that is? I don't want to hear those words coming out of your mouth. Are they
[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:49.480]   playing Pokemon go in France Mike Elgin? They are there well it's funny
[00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:53.000]   because here in the part of the city where we are it's the old part so you
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.240]   can tell that the streets are all sort of carved out in the Middle Ages they're
[00:07:57.240 --> 00:08:02.960]   all curvy and narrow. So when you see on the on the on the map where they're
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:06.080]   a Pokemon you know exactly where they are because the streets are like 12
[00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:10.920]   feet wide or something. There's not big open spaces around here where they could
[00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:14.600]   be anywhere in the vicinity so it's kind of funny I just looked at the screen
[00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:17.280]   I'm like oh yeah that's right in front of the burger place and I know exactly
[00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:21.280]   where they put it that one. But Lee I'm curious about what you think. Well you
[00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:26.920]   wrote the most vicious article about it. Well you know it was taken as an
[00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:32.080]   anti-Pokemon article. I basically said that it's a public menace. Well that sounds
[00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:36.920]   anti-Pokemon to me. Well but the reason it's a public menace is simply because
[00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:40.920]   it's number one super popular and number two I think we're at a really
[00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:45.960]   interesting point right now where we culturally haven't adapted to mixed
[00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:51.120]   reality and and augmented reality applications. We don't we haven't learned
[00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:55.920]   how to function in society with virtual objects all around us and I think you
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:59.280]   know you've mentioned on previous shows I believe it's Twit that you know how
[00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:02.160]   great would Google Glass be with this thing I mean it would be really great.
[00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:06.640]   You keep heads up and you'd be more aware of your surroundings. I really do
[00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:11.760]   think that Google Glass like glasses will come out that are not bulky and ugly
[00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:15.600]   that are socially acceptable and I think augmented and mixed reality
[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:19.680]   applications like Pokemon Go and other things are going to kind of mainstream
[00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:23.360]   that piece of hardware and I think that's gonna be great but right now I think
[00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:28.520]   you know we've sort of adapted to for example texting people jackasses still
[00:09:28.520 --> 00:09:32.320]   drive and text and stuff like that but for the most part etiquette is and and
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:37.520]   social norms are arriving around around texting I think eventually that will
[00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:41.640]   happen with mixed reality eventually you know I think that three years from now
[00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:47.080]   there'll be you know 50 or 100 augmented or mixed reality applications that lots
[00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:50.880]   and lots of people are using so it won't be like everybody using the same one.
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:57.680]   Jeff you disagree? Well I think you found the thing I put in the rundown.
[00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:02.880]   Your cursor is on it. Guy playing Pokemon while driving. Oh the Baltimore guy.
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:08.160]   Oh yeah yeah yeah. I'll get Carson to play it for so apparently this is police
[00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:13.600]   video dash cam video from a police car guy playing Pokemon Go runs into the
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:19.800]   Vethors thing you could run into a Baltimore police cruiser. Let's see if we
[00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:23.600]   could see the video here. I think you can go full screen on a Carson yeah and
[00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:27.760]   this is for people listening all the same thing happened to me so it wasn't
[00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:34.080]   just me for some reason that page does not allow us to roll up and see it.
[00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:36.920]   Oh yeah. It's off screen. Same thing happened to me I thought maybe it was.
[00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:40.880]   Click off click off to that tweet then you can do it. That's all right. I get the
[00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:45.880]   idea. To me the phenomenon danger around Pokemon is nothing is nothing
[00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:50.560]   about Pokemon that's bad. It's it's it's a cool fun game but it's kind of like
[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:55.800]   Black Friday. I mean people are focused on something other than paying attention
[00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:59.040]   to where they're going and what they're doing and and they're in a
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:02.640]   competitive kind of situation so there's a bit of a frenzy sometimes with these
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:05.800]   large mobs and I think that's really the thing. It's not Pokemon itself it's
[00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:10.480]   just large numbers of people millions of dozens of millions of people out there
[00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:14.040]   wandering around and not really paying full attention to where they're going
[00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:18.720]   and what polls they're walking into and what cliffs they're falling off and so
[00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:22.800]   on. I don't think a heads-up display is going to help that too much because
[00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:29.040]   you're still going to be focused on the virtual and not the actual reality. I
[00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:34.200]   think given what we're how insane this craze is becoming I don't know it's
[00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:38.000]   like in France but everybody's playing it and everywhere I go there are
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:43.280]   surprisingly few problems you've got probably a hundred million players and
[00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:47.960]   a handful of incidents. Most people are all right although one of the issues and
[00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:51.280]   I didn't really understand why people were walking off cliffs and climbing
[00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:54.440]   fences there I didn't because I didn't fully understand the game there's a
[00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:58.880]   tracker in the game that you can use to try to you could see what's nearby and
[00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:02.440]   try to track them down and I think that's what's happening is people are using the
[00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:07.320]   tracker were like looking at the tracker seeing am I close am I close and then
[00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:12.640]   walking off of a cliff. Interestingly, Niantic claims it's a bug I think was
[00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:16.960]   intentional the tracker hasn't worked in a couple of days so I have a feeling
[00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:20.960]   that that was in response to that. But what I'm really excited about when I think
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:26.080]   it's fascinating from a culture point of view is the fact that now a new
[00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:32.260]   generation of kids are going to grow up where it's normal to have virtual objects
[00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:36.480]   floating in space all over the place and you know you think about kids who you
[00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:40.360]   know you see we've all seen the videos of babies who pick up a magazine and try
[00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:44.560]   to swipe right and you know use it like an iPad they from the very beginning our
[00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:49.360]   program to understand multi-touch interfaces and that's that kind of thing
[00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:54.840]   it's gonna get to the point where it'll just be normal for these these
[00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:59.520]   phantoms to be all around us it's kind of like in the old days when people used
[00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:02.960]   to think that everything was haunted and there were ghosts and you know stuff
[00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:06.400]   like that all over the place they'll be in fact be able to see these things and
[00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:09.640]   again it'll be lots and lots of things it won't be just games it'll be
[00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:13.000]   augmented reality and other other stuff but we're now entering in a whole new
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.320]   cultural world where there's a parallel universe or many parallel universes
[00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:21.160]   existing simultaneously in the same space and I think culturally that's
[00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:26.280]   really a weird and wonderful thing yeah I that was my exact reaction do you
[00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:34.720]   know if you see any application for news oh absolutely I mean I guess well
[00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:40.240]   maybe not news but history so you know news is the first draft of history but
[00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:43.160]   you you'll be able to sit you know walk around and say well this is the place
[00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:46.760]   where this took place and it could be a historic event or well in fact it wasn't
[00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:51.960]   a nine-ticks first program was field trip which did exactly that right yeah
[00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:55.920]   and without augmented reality but that as you were walking by a point of interest
[00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:59.880]   it would narrate it to you and you're with your smartphone I don't have the
[00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:04.920]   problem with news is not near you in general right so most of the time the
[00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:08.960]   news we will look my name most of the time the news we see is like even here
[00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:13.760]   okay so there's a big fire dairy farm lots of smoke in the air this morning
[00:14:13.760 --> 00:14:17.880]   we're trying to we're smelling it it's smoky Lisa said the only I'm on the
[00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:21.760]   internet there's a fire in the next county over I can't find it I said no no
[00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:26.520]   it's not it's just it's nearby it took us a while we finally tracked it down to
[00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:31.640]   a farm dairy farm not so far from us but that's and so that's as locals you can
[00:14:31.640 --> 00:14:34.880]   get and still that there was I don't think there's any application for that
[00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:38.880]   you certainly don't want people going oh let me go find the fire you could
[00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:42.520]   super input you could look at the smoke and if there's a database you could
[00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:45.640]   actually put your news stories that would say hey this is such and such
[00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:51.840]   dairy fire that's interesting or yeah or you know traffic or like true
[00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:55.360]   traffic yeah might be really interesting to pull up your phone and just isn't
[00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:59.800]   that what ways are ready really well no no no but like planned things like we're
[00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:03.520]   right now our major freeways under construction I would love to be able to
[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:07.720]   like pull up information about when this is now planned to be done because it
[00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:11.960]   happens you know it gets updated every few months that oh this is gonna be two
[00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:17.280]   months later this gonna be three years later so that's news ish you know I
[00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:22.480]   wrote an article recently about the attack in Nice and about the failure of
[00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:27.840]   the French governments they commissioned a an emergency app that is supposed to
[00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:31.880]   tell you what's going on and where to go and that sort of thing and of course
[00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:35.280]   people went to Twitter and Facebook to find out what's going on with their
[00:15:35.280 --> 00:15:39.640]   loved ones so there's a real-time news is breaking right now kind of thing that
[00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:43.120]   has a practical dimension which is like what should you do is it happening near
[00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:46.640]   you is it happening relative good but you can imagine a future where people do
[00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:50.760]   have smart glasses or do have are looking at their phones and an augmented
[00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:55.120]   reality out pops up and says there is a there's an incident happening that way
[00:15:55.120 --> 00:16:00.600]   and you need to go this way and will guide you to a shelter so or something
[00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:05.200]   like that or you know you could imagine the future of emergency services that
[00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:10.320]   use augmented reality to save lives and to give people immediate direction and
[00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:14.320]   attention and again one of the benefits of of having smart glasses is that you
[00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:18.520]   don't happen to be have to be looking at your phone at that exact moment you can
[00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:22.640]   set it say okay when whenever there's an emergency I want to do my glasses right
[00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:27.520]   away and you can imagine that that could be something really really useful
[00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:31.360]   during breaking news events and I can also guarantee that the most interesting
[00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:34.120]   use is something we aren't even imagining because that's how it often is
[00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:40.080]   with this kind of stuff now it's porn it's always a first it's born then it's
[00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:41.680]   okay
[00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:46.840]   interesting what if you had we really could get x-ray glasses right
[00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:51.640]   here every boys fantasy yeah combos on our chatroom said I like this what if you
[00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:57.640]   go to a historic play you know go to ruins what if you went to the ruins of
[00:16:57.640 --> 00:17:01.960]   Palmyra and you saw the original building super you could put on your
[00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:05.400]   glasses and see the original buildings as they might have been when that
[00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:10.200]   people or you could get I mean you could have people you could create like not
[00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:15.040]   theater but stories where people came in you know dressed up or actors played
[00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:19.360]   role I mean just to make history kind of come alive go to Pompeii see the lava
[00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:24.000]   rolling in that would be you know I'm I'm wandering around France and there
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.320]   is a surprising number of French people in this city who don't speak English at
[00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:34.200]   all and and I don't speak French I speak a little French but not enough and so
[00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:38.320]   I've been using Google translate so the other day we were in a shop and we were
[00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:43.760]   just looking and the person there asked us in French I assume would you like
[00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:46.960]   can I help you would you like something and so I just pulled out Google translate
[00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:49.760]   and said oh we're just looking right now thank you and I played it and it was
[00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:55.600]   instantaneous work great she got a kick out of it was awesome but if you could
[00:17:55.600 --> 00:18:00.880]   put that as augmented reality that whole you know if I could be shown what to say
[00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:04.640]   here here three you're in a you're in this type of shop here are some things you
[00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:08.760]   could say this means you know and and so it would be invisible to the other
[00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:14.560]   person and so in my case it would feel like knowledge would be a surrogate for
[00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:19.880]   actual skill and knowledge in speaking French and I would love that and of
[00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:23.720]   course that's not exactly news but that's a way that we could interact with the
[00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:28.120]   world that would be super practical and you know have a uniting effect because
[00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:30.480]   in fact you could interact with people speak other languages so do you think
[00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:35.280]   we'll look back at Pokemon go and years to come and say this was when when the
[00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:38.720]   virtual world started to become the real world or look at how we look at
[00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:42.040]   Pokemon Pokemon I don't know we have we look at it we look back and it was like
[00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:48.000]   what was that all about we have one of this one kid here Kevin's great who
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:52.960]   was clearly obsessed with Pokemon and he was at lunch today showing us all he
[00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:56.040]   said well these are the legendary characters they have not yet appeared
[00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:59.800]   in the Pokemon go game however we have some series that this character is going
[00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:05.720]   to really become mutator and and it was I mean he's like he knows every detail
[00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:09.040]   and we're and everybody's gathered around going okay suddenly there's this
[00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:12.520]   interest like the knowledge that he has been maintaining for years absolutely
[00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:17.560]   no value at all and everybody's gonna oh yeah tell us more Kevin tell us more
[00:19:17.560 --> 00:19:23.520]   it's like the village shaman it's so great it's so funny somebody's go ahead
[00:19:23.520 --> 00:19:28.480]   I was gonna say on this idea of virtual reality there is like a slight or not
[00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:33.520]   there's a slight downside which is it could create a potentially huge digital
[00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:38.480]   divide one if you don't embrace this imagine how cut off you would be if
[00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:41.680]   everyone takes it for granted that you have these instant translation skills
[00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:46.760]   or you have the ability to see emergency breaking news on your phone and then
[00:19:46.760 --> 00:19:50.240]   the other is what was the other well we're already there aren't we in many ways
[00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:54.200]   if you don't have the internet don't you think you yes you feel pretty left out
[00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:58.680]   internet and it's a problem for them right it's just that golf is only
[00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:03.200]   widening you know it's you talk we talk about income inequality but that there's
[00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:07.640]   all kinds of related inequalities is that more more no it's like there we not
[00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:10.000]   think more people are getting on the internet through more meat they're both
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.880]   I think both things are happening there's huge number of people who don't have
[00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:15.880]   the internet and therefore are completely locked out on the other hand
[00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:19.440]   there are people all over the world who can get lectures and coursework from
[00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:23.920]   MIT and Stanford and they don't have to you know they're not among the elite who
[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:27.920]   actually attend those schools and all the information and knowledge of mankind
[00:20:27.920 --> 00:20:32.320]   that exists on the internet which is available in little villages if they
[00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:36.800]   have the internet so it's simultaneously as Jeff said bringing right people
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:41.920]   erasing a digital divide and at the same time as as more and more people get it
[00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:45.600]   and more and more people are not on it yet it sort of creates a digital divide
[00:20:45.600 --> 00:20:48.640]   because again you have to have these tools otherwise you just are just locked
[00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:51.880]   out right what's happening that's it to Stacy's point as it becomes ubiquitous
[00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:55.880]   than those who don't are really disadvantaged it's a we're not having
[00:20:55.880 --> 00:20:59.440]   conversations about like privacy and while we're having them we're just not
[00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:04.640]   changing anything so you have to think about when you start giving like your
[00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:09.920]   actual location data up to everyone in their dog and you know government starts
[00:21:09.920 --> 00:21:13.880]   rely on this are we going to start having those conversations about what
[00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:19.320]   information people have and how they can use it because I do think we're we're
[00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:22.440]   moving down this path without really thinking about where it's gonna lead us
[00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:26.480]   well I agree although it's almost inevitable right I mean what are you
[00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:29.320]   gonna do it's not you can't say well stop wait a minute let's let's think
[00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:33.960]   about this no no but we could we could there's there's many many many many
[00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:39.520]   naysane caution monsters out there you know somebody who plays the
[00:21:39.520 --> 00:21:43.360]   optimist role most of the time a boy do I get bombarded with people say but
[00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:46.320]   this could happen but that can happen and and my response is always well if
[00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:49.200]   something could happen do you then cut off all the possibilities by kind of
[00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:51.960]   what it could be that bad thing could happen you cut off the good that could
[00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:57.360]   come to we're smart we people we build civilization we build buildings we built
[00:21:57.360 --> 00:22:02.880]   Pokemon go we can do a lot of things we have a president well I know I almost
[00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:06.800]   completed you know Mike Elkins started the sentence there are some people who
[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:09.120]   don't have the internet I almost completed it and they're voting for
[00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:13.280]   Trump it does seem like I think Trump himself has the
[00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:18.400]   yeah apparently doesn't have the software that allows him to check Twitter
[00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:22.320]   yes Twitter which is the best part of the internet right or the worst it's
[00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:25.480]   simultaneously the best in you know there's a there's a really interesting
[00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:28.880]   company that I don't think gets enough attention I talked to the CEO Julian
[00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:32.440]   Ranger of Digime I don't know if you're familiar with Digime but essentially
[00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:36.000]   they're working on a sit right now with it you can do is download all of your
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.040]   social networking stuff everything you've ever posted every picture other
[00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:45.040]   people's comments on your pictures ice from the beginning of time on all social
[00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:48.640]   networks into a single place where you can slice and dice and search and do all
[00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:52.040]   this stuff very cool free app there's it's a freemium model so there's a paid
[00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:57.160]   version but what he's working on is a system where you physically download all
[00:22:57.160 --> 00:23:01.560]   your stuff and control it and your information and then he believes that
[00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:05.440]   he can get the companies like Google and Facebook and others to come to you and
[00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:09.840]   essentially make a deal with you about your data here's what we're gonna do
[00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:13.560]   with it okay I approve that here's what else we're gonna do with it no I don't
[00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:17.400]   approve that you can't do that and sort of give you control of your day it's a
[00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:21.400]   really fascinating and breathtakingly large vision and the most fascinating
[00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:26.440]   part is they have this sense of of responsibility about it where they don't
[00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:29.680]   want to actually control it too much so I told him why don't you just do a
[00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:34.640]   social network it could be like a super friend feed where where all my social
[00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:37.920]   networks would be in one place just give me the opportunity to see other
[00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:41.440]   people's posts and post from that to everything else and he said no we're not
[00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:45.600]   gonna do that because that's the mistake Twitter made what Twitter does did was
[00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:48.600]   they originally opened up the third parties they let all these different
[00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:51.120]   companies do all these different things and when anything started to succeed
[00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:54.400]   they said okay well now we're gonna do that and we they lock those people out
[00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:58.480]   of it and they they they were greedy about controlling the stuff that everybody
[00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:01.720]   was doing and he said that's the downfall he said we will never do that we
[00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:05.640]   will let third parties do all that kind of stuff because no one company should
[00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:09.400]   have that much control and power and and by the way even though they let you
[00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:14.040]   download all your data they themselves have no access to it at all and they
[00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:16.680]   encrypted all that kind of stuff as well so Digimi is really an interesting
[00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:22.680]   company let me show you go ahead my data is worthless on its own it's only an
[00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:27.240]   aggregate that is someone's data is useful to these companies they don't
[00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:31.400]   they don't care about me personally no but Stacy I'll disagree there I've been
[00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:34.320]   arguing about the news business for example is we have to stop treating
[00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:37.200]   people as a mass we have to start treating people as individuals now we
[00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:40.320]   don't have the capability you're quite right but if we did have the capability
[00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:43.920]   where I can target you individually I know you're a mother and your kids this
[00:24:43.920 --> 00:24:47.800]   old and the kid likes this and things that you you allow me to know to give
[00:24:47.800 --> 00:24:51.200]   you greater relevance then I'm going to increase the value of our relationship
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:56.440]   hugely but we're not good at that in our in media business because we're used
[00:24:56.440 --> 00:25:01.360]   treated raise mass Amazon does know you as an individual and your data is
[00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:07.000]   valuable at an individual level so I know I don't think it's just an
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.600]   aggregate the data is valuable I think that if the company is set up well to
[00:25:10.600 --> 00:25:16.680]   give you personal service and relevance and value then in turn your data is
[00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:19.960]   valuable to them because they've made it valuable to you let me show you
[00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:24.680]   something friend of mine David Glickman has just released it's an iOS app I'm
[00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:29.400]   curious what you think of this is called our data it's an ad blocker but
[00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:35.040]   it's a weird ad blocker because essentially you can agree to not be
[00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:40.400]   blocked and the company that is you're seeing their ads will share some of its
[00:25:40.400 --> 00:25:44.320]   revenue with you which you can then give to charity right now it's Susan B.
[00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:50.160]   Coleman but they're going to add other charities to it so the idea is yes
[00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:56.840]   your data has value and in particular your your attention to ads has value
[00:25:56.840 --> 00:26:01.640]   here's how you can kind of recover some of that money and make everybody happy
[00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:04.760]   by the way because the media companies are still getting the lion's share of it
[00:26:04.760 --> 00:26:08.640]   because you're seeing their ads instead of not with an ad blocker and I have to
[00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:11.560]   give it to charity Leo can I wouldn't be nice if you could keep it I don't know
[00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:15.880]   if you can keep it I think it's a really interesting take on this and it's the
[00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:20.880]   similar idea which is it's your data you should have control of it but maybe
[00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:25.160]   this is this is a more practical approach to it acknowledging that you're
[00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:29.520]   going to be giving out data and so kind of making a transaction around it what
[00:26:29.520 --> 00:26:34.200]   do you think I could go for that yeah
[00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:40.000]   yes I think that I think the problem is the public doesn't care I think they
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.640]   don't yeah they're not gonna care it would you know if they could get a 50
[00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:47.120]   cent discount on something they give away all their data for life I think I
[00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:51.920]   think the public has demonstrated and we in the media have failed to you know
[00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:56.880]   we're either alarmists and the sky is falling or we're you know it doesn't
[00:26:56.880 --> 00:27:01.240]   matter don't worry about it or we have these complicated stories about why it's
[00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:05.520]   a big deal I think the public really doesn't understand it it's a headache to
[00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:10.360]   think about and they just would rather just get the benefits of using Facebook
[00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:14.960]   and all these other services without thinking about the data and again part
[00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:18.440]   of the problem is that it's really counterintuitive what's possible what
[00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:22.480]   sort of story is possible to construct I didn't even just metadata for the
[00:27:22.480 --> 00:27:26.720]   communication I guess the best we can hope to do is just let them know so that
[00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:30.160]   they at least kind of or at least it's not completely in the dark about it I
[00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:35.000]   take to your point though Mike I'm thinking the Google surveys app I use
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:40.240]   yeah because I get like 30 cents and I give them whatever they are so I just
[00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:44.440]   got another one of those Leo where I got a United Airlines and you know I'm a
[00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:49.440]   happy prisoner of United Airlines is global services and I just got offered
[00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:53.960]   to if I take a survey and and when I started this I got 600 miles oh okay I'll
[00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:58.160]   do that right and I'm thinking oh I'll make that every time next one is is a
[00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:04.240]   20 minute survey that gives me 60 miles not so much but I did a low
[00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:08.000]   they've been but now you've put a value on your data yes well I know I know
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:12.800]   it's not 600 yeah and it asked me all kinds of demographic things because the
[00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:18.240]   the advantages I'll get a better servant more viable survey by them knowing that
[00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:22.920]   I'm this age and this education is this a sign that we're figuring it out yeah
[00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:26.240]   I think so too there's a marketplace that's the bottom line here and it's
[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:32.240]   Stacy's quite right that that there needs to be the data on its own on its own
[00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:36.200]   alone doesn't have valueless as a context unless I have a relationship with you
[00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:39.880]   that means that oh I can sell you something or I can show you something or
[00:28:39.880 --> 00:28:43.160]   I can give you greater value in something and then and then that's the
[00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:46.080]   reason for you to reveal yourself to me is either because I'm paying you straight
[00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:50.360]   out or I'm paying you with better service or whatever it is so there's also this
[00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:55.880]   idea in this this kind of came to me while we're talking in these virtual
[00:28:55.880 --> 00:29:01.200]   reality things it adds another layer of not being able to control so here here's
[00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:05.560]   the scenario I would ask you guys to envision if I'm walking down the street
[00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:10.000]   and someone holds up their phone what's to stop them from seeing like virtual
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:15.680]   reality revenge porn affixed to me as a person oh my god yeah or something so so
[00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:18.480]   that's another thing that I'm like oh wait that would be terrible think about
[00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:22.360]   all that think about the lack of power you have over Google searches imagine it
[00:29:22.360 --> 00:29:25.920]   actually applied to your face maybe it doesn't maybe it just is a Google search
[00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:30.400]   but remember Google has that capability and turn it off did you know they said
[00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:33.840]   oh one thing we won't do is is face recognition it ever turned it on yeah or
[00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:38.560]   yeah turn it on but but it doesn't have to be revenge porn what if I could just I
[00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:42.880]   would personally love this but you may not hold it hold up a phone and take a
[00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:47.640]   picture or see somebody and get the information about them yeah like what do
[00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:50.640]   you remember I think I was highlight was that the app that showed you when
[00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:56.440]   people were by yeah that app creeps me out to know and it's out by you know
[00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:59.800]   people would you be looking around and you'd be like oh I turned it off after
[00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:02.640]   it's a different experience and I have really have to acknowledge this for men
[00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:07.560]   and women oh yes that's that's why I'm bringing it up yeah no as the as the
[00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:13.080]   token woman on this panel but I really have to acknowledge that the way as guys
[00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:19.560]   we don't have any idea how bad I can get so okay yeah so I also read right
[00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:25.320]   question of of you know you you you you suggested a disgusting application for
[00:30:25.320 --> 00:30:31.120]   the technology we know is coming and you know people can be awful but it raises
[00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:36.600]   a kind of philosophical question about what's the difference between a computer
[00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:46.080]   augmented fantasy and one that's purely mental is there a difference well it's
[00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:50.920]   an interesting I undress you in my head is that I do not like the creeps who when
[00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:53.760]   you walk down the street undress you with their eyes and you can tell they're
[00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:58.840]   doing it can't you yeah it's it's not it's not nice yeah but this isn't just
[00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:03.920]   that this is this is personal information you can affix to a person or a
[00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:08.800]   place and think about you know think about swatting there could be virtual
[00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:14.400]   not swatting actually just virtual harassment yes stalking associate yeah
[00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:19.440]   well and and of course inevitably as with all as we've seen again with all
[00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:25.120]   these technologies all of this will happen yeah so yes and we still socket
[00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:29.040]   deal I mean look at Twitter and how I want to talk about Milo Yiannopoulos in
[00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:35.240]   just a second yeah I was just about to bring up my okay don't stand by for Milo in
[00:31:35.240 --> 00:31:40.840]   a moment first time hey we this is I love doing this show when we get these
[00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:45.440]   great people Mike Elgin is here he's from ex-Paul Povall so France he is
[00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:51.680]   becoming a digital nomad is it becoming nomad calm becoming nomad calm
[00:31:51.680 --> 00:31:58.680]   yes it's and he's drinking red wine which makes me so jealous yes yes yeah and I
[00:31:58.680 --> 00:32:04.720]   advocate the nomadic lifestyle everybody should try it at least once it
[00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:07.520]   sounds like it sounds like you're saying I advocate the nude lifestyle
[00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:11.120]   everybody should try just once it's it's funny it's it's as similar to
[00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:15.400]   newism nomadic yeah nomadic nudism is my new you don't have any clothes you're
[00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:19.160]   out there aren't you just don't they call themselves naturalist
[00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:31.040]   nature is not natural nature is naturalist no leaves I have I have been to
[00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:38.560]   nature's places in my life when I was in high school we used to go to the nude
[00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:43.520]   beach all the time and I was purely innocent well and you immediately get
[00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:46.960]   over it right that's the thing I should point out is yeah because the people who
[00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:51.760]   frequent such beaches are not well even then it's just even if they were all
[00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:56.600]   gorgeous it doesn't matter they're just you get it takes you literally one
[00:32:56.600 --> 00:33:02.040]   minute to go okay I get it and just be normal again there there's a hot springs
[00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:06.280]   up here is the same thing or Tasa Hara and you just get used to it it's just
[00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:10.040]   like saw saw nose and Germany as we discussed sorry on a journey right in
[00:33:10.040 --> 00:33:13.360]   some ways I think that's the better way to do this is just to it's just to say
[00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:18.040]   you know we all have bodies yeah and not make it a taboo because that's what's
[00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:22.440]   that's that's where it becomes creepy when it becomes a taboo but at the same
[00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:26.920]   time I respect you right not to walk around naked I think that when you the
[00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:30.840]   biggest thing you learn when you go to a nude beach is you you gain an appreciation
[00:33:30.840 --> 00:33:40.680]   for clothing it's awesome also with this it's always wonderful Stacy Higginbotham
[00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:44.080]   we missed you terribly last week I'm so glad you're back you know I want to say
[00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:49.480]   something here I see this on Twitter all the time no one no one Gina
[00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:54.720]   Japan he her number is retired no one replaces Gina but Stacy I'm so grateful
[00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:58.960]   you're on the show you get tremendous reviews all the fans of the show are so
[00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:02.320]   happy you're here I'm happier here I know Leo is happier here it's I just
[00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:07.280]   wanted to say you are a joy and a brilliant addition and I'm so glad you're
[00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:12.800]   here yeah yep I second that IOT podcast if you can't get enough go to IOT
[00:34:12.800 --> 00:34:17.160]   podcast.com for her Internet of Things podcast with our other great friend Kevin
[00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:22.400]   Tofel who will be on your show but refuses to be on our show no he he's asking
[00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:27.080]   okay come on the show yeah he's been asking for about a month now I think I
[00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:33.720]   learned something about Kevin when I was trying to book him or or TNT which is
[00:34:33.720 --> 00:34:37.720]   that he's very he's very schedule oriented so if you catch him on short
[00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:42.480]   notice he's never available right but if you say okay in in September can you
[00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:46.640]   do the state he'll say yes and he'll be there well but and in this case it's
[00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:50.680]   because he's now working as a consultant to Google right so he has to get
[00:34:50.680 --> 00:34:55.280]   permission as I think everybody does you know we're we got so spoiled by Matt
[00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:59.720]   cuts because he was employee number 11 he could just do it trusted and try but
[00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:04.720]   now he can't by the way he's now working for the government also so is that the
[00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:08.480]   case well it's the not just like Kevin he says well I have to get permission I
[00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:14.400]   don't want to do it without permission oh shoot yeah we've mentioned this before
[00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:18.760]   but just in case you don't know Matt has gone to work for a group that's I think
[00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:22.440]   a great it's kind of like Code for America the idea of these really smart
[00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:27.440]   coders and technologists helping make government work better more transparent
[00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:31.720]   and I think it's he's at the Pentagon he's at the Pentagon yeah Colonel Pentagon
[00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:37.160]   is weaponized Matt cuts well somebody had to I'm just glad it was our side
[00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:42.600]   also here Jeff Jarvis who we love dearly to progressive journalism at CUNY
[00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:49.000]   no you don't no one does I love you you're my brother from another mother and
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:53.080]   just look at that beard I know he's gorgeous I think that's part of the
[00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:58.360]   problem today is that I'm hitting the white balance on the beard is yeah that's
[00:35:58.360 --> 00:36:03.120]   what it is you have a you have a little Gandalf thing going there yeah I don't
[00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:08.880]   know just blinding the camera I showed today brought to you by the great Casper
[00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:13.520]   mattress you wouldn't think a mattress would be part of the revolution but it is
[00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:20.200]   it is as part of the internet revolution changing the way we do business in this
[00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:24.840]   country Casper mattresses are a made in the US they're made by engineers
[00:36:24.840 --> 00:36:29.960]   obsessing to make the best premium mattress possible using the latest
[00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:35.320]   materials they combined springy latex foam with supported memory foam to give
[00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:41.160]   you just like a goldy not goldy lock sleep just the right amount of sink and
[00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:45.720]   bounce so you get the perfect night sleeping by the way on these hot summer
[00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:49.160]   nights where's 102 degrees in Austin you're gonna love this because they
[00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:53.320]   Casper mattress is sleep cool they breathe and that really helps you sleep
[00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:59.880]   better 2016 business intelligence group innovation award winner the Casper
[00:36:59.880 --> 00:37:04.640]   mattress and all of that for less because there's no middle person you don't have
[00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:10.440]   to go to a mattress store now you may say but Leo I hear you now saying but Leo I
[00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:14.760]   like to go to the mattress store I want to try before I buy yeah but let me
[00:37:14.760 --> 00:37:18.040]   point out that five minutes on a mattress in broad daylight with a sales

[00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:38.440]   you seen it no I'm going Friday I'm dying to see it too it really shocked me
[00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:43.560]   that there was this kind of undercurrent after the first trailer of people saying
[00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:48.200]   oh there should women shouldn't be ghost busters just I didn't even get I was
[00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:52.240]   like what do you mean well and then I and then I found out that there's this
[00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:57.200]   kind of general consensus among some that women aren't funny which is funny
[00:38:57.200 --> 00:39:01.440]   because maybe because I just know a lot of funny women but I think some of the
[00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:05.880]   best comics working there women absolutely including Melissa McCarthy
[00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:11.000]   who's in the new ghost busters and I never remember her name the one of the
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:15.640]   smart ghost busters and then lastly Jones no well Leslie Jones is the black
[00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:22.440]   mister if we're gonna oh you know what and which is hysterical way and who is
[00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:29.360]   oh she's new and she's great she is I love her anyway Leslie Jones was getting
[00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:36.240]   a lot of nasty not only misogynistic but racist horribly racist tweeting and
[00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:43.280]   did I thought a brave courageous thing she retweeted them yeah oh which you
[00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:49.520]   know that's gotta be hard to do it was stop there for one second I agree as
[00:39:49.520 --> 00:39:56.040]   brave was the best tactic well there's a lot we debate about this all the time
[00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:59.600]   all of us have been harassed on Twitter and I think all that it was a fee in
[00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:05.600]   the troll or was exposing the troll is the troll care I think it's exposing so
[00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:11.360]   people either think it's not their problem or they're willfully blind to some
[00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:15.720]   of the misogynistic and racist things that happen and I think it's important for
[00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:20.840]   people to see it and I say that is someone who I actually don't get a lot
[00:40:20.840 --> 00:40:26.320]   of harassment on Twitter please don't start don't say anything you know that's
[00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:29.960]   another thing by the way what a chilling effect this has doesn't it yes I almost
[00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:33.120]   don't even want to talk about it because I don't want to encourage them no you
[00:40:33.120 --> 00:40:36.880]   should talk about it you should tell people that it's unacceptable because the
[00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:41.880]   problem is people who are hidden the majority and people they don't see it or
[00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:46.840]   they don't understand it and they don't speak up about it I have you know I had
[00:40:46.840 --> 00:40:50.840]   Virginia Heffernan on triangulation on my she's got a new book on the internet
[00:40:50.840 --> 00:40:55.200]   magic it was great that was great Leo yeah and we had this conversation and she
[00:40:55.200 --> 00:41:00.480]   said it's I was kind of shocked because she has been harassed on Twitter somebody
[00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:07.120]   said she's worse than Isis which is such a ridiculous insult almost but it's
[00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:12.320]   pretty you know but anyway she said well but it's not physically damaging to you
[00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:18.560]   so it's it's harmless she kind of stuck up for the free speech aspect of it and
[00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:22.400]   I said well I don't think it is harmless it's psychologically damaging and there
[00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:25.120]   there's bullying there are people who have killed themselves because they've
[00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:29.880]   been bullied on Facebook and Twitter it could be damaging to your career it
[00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:36.240]   could be damaging to your relationships think about if someone tweets a picture
[00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:41.240]   of your kids school at you there you go I mean that's I'm sorry that's that's
[00:41:41.240 --> 00:41:45.920]   scary is a lot of doxing that is highly damaging so anyway so we had that
[00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:50.720]   argument I she's not here so I'm not I don't want to you know attack her in
[00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:56.160]   absentia but so but some people do say well but yeah but and I think I think
[00:41:56.160 --> 00:41:59.960]   really again I shouldn't put words in her mouth read her book magic and loss and
[00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:05.040]   we're trying to get her on the show but I think what she was saying is it and
[00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:12.480]   this I've said this myself sunshine is a is the best disinfectant that putting
[00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:16.080]   this out in the public eye she said hey you're gonna learn a lesson you learn
[00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:19.120]   a lesson about yourself and have to look at yourself and I said well I don't
[00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:25.920]   think most of the time that's very generous and then she also pointed out
[00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:33.160]   that some she was talking about Gawker revealing the the affairs of some
[00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:38.240]   gentlemen and to his wife and that that was good because the woman is being
[00:42:38.240 --> 00:42:41.840]   gas-lighted and she needed to hear the truth and I said yeah but maybe from
[00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:48.400]   relatives or friends but not from well not not in full public view Gawker for
[00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:50.760]   friend if a friend tells your friend will take you out for a drink and say I got
[00:42:50.760 --> 00:42:54.920]   to tell you something you know very gently yeah yeah we're versus versus in
[00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:59.240]   the public you know the difference is I think that in the broad public square
[00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:05.400]   and in the and in the public square that it is internet yes unbridled free
[00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:08.840]   speech nothing you do about it Isis is there good guys are there bad guys are
[00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:16.040]   there but in a privately owned entity institution whether that institution is
[00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:21.480]   a platform Twitter or a publication a magazine or a newspaper or book
[00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:25.720]   publisher I think that those institutions those entities have every right and
[00:43:25.720 --> 00:43:33.160]   sometimes a responsibility to set a standard and live by that standard now
[00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:37.320]   Twitter we value Twitter well Twitter is open let me let me continue with the
[00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:42.320]   saga here and by the way Kate McKinnon awesome that was this before
[00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:49.320]   Ghostbusters who's name I couldn't do so so Leslie Jones was just get so she
[00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:54.520]   retweeted this stuff and then and then said and I'm leaving by apparently now
[00:43:54.520 --> 00:44:00.320]   I'm not sure what the connection is at Breitbart editor Milo Yiannopoulos who's
[00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:06.680]   been suspended on Twitter before was it was banned by Twitter I guess he had
[00:44:06.680 --> 00:44:12.120]   insane he had some he had some terrible racist and he more importantly encouraged
[00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:15.880]   others right to do the same which which which on one said is actually the
[00:44:15.880 --> 00:44:18.280]   greater issue you're gonna find trolls out there you're gonna find
[00:44:18.280 --> 00:44:22.440]   there's nothing but those who encouraged them are at least as responsible as
[00:44:22.440 --> 00:44:28.600]   the trolls but okay on the other hand Milo uses real name I mean you can ban
[00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:33.240]   him because it's him none of those other people I'm sure we're using their real
[00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:36.840]   names and could be effectively banned because they just created a new account
[00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:41.000]   though you know that Twitter having since you have trolls structurally Twitter
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:44.200]   cannot Twitter could do it well Twitter could do a far better job there's
[00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:48.600]   patterns they don't they don't hook up to it you know there's one troll that
[00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:51.880]   came after us like God I'm sorry I don't want to say this because you know
[00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:58.680]   may come back but would come after us 10 times in a day 20 times in a day and
[00:44:58.680 --> 00:45:01.400]   you there's a pattern Twitter can be sort of
[00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:04.920]   structurally this is a problem I think the only solution if you wanted to get
[00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:07.560]   rid of this is to force people to use the real names no
[00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:13.960]   because I always say and well then we always say I can I can I can tell you a
[00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:18.760]   hole by name anonymity is not yes anonymity is the cloak of the
[00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:21.880]   coward but that's the problem but that's the problem if you're anonymous you
[00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:26.280]   cannot block them they just created anonymity it's so here's here's the
[00:45:26.280 --> 00:45:30.280]   here's a problem so first of all I really kind of disagree with
[00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:33.960]   and and I actually went back and forth with Cara Swisher and a few others
[00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:39.800]   about this particular issue Milo's fan is yeah it smells to me like
[00:45:39.800 --> 00:45:42.760]   Twitter is doing what Facebook is always doing which Facebook
[00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:47.480]   Facebook kind of and I don't mean to overly exaggerate or overly
[00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:51.000]   criticize but Facebook generally seems to have no
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:54.840]   ethics they try things and if they get burned in the public in public opinion
[00:45:54.840 --> 00:45:57.960]   they apologize and they stop and they go try something else
[00:45:57.960 --> 00:46:01.080]   and Twitter has not always been like that they've been kind of a free speech
[00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:04.120]   fundamentalists in certain ways they have their own system which is deeply
[00:46:04.120 --> 00:46:06.840]   fought and I can get into that in sec but
[00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:10.680]   basically they did what they did purely because of the PR
[00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:15.880]   they essentially said that Milo is was targeted harassment well
[00:46:15.880 --> 00:46:20.520]   we both know that half the people on this panel have multiple Twitter accounts
[00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:23.880]   where the whole account is all about targeted harassment of people on this
[00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:28.120]   they're not our accounts right there people's accounts yeah my point is that
[00:46:28.120 --> 00:46:32.040]   the whole purpose of the account I mean Milo's purpose of his account was not
[00:46:32.040 --> 00:46:36.280]   just harassed no he's a he's himself he's himself and he's
[00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:40.520]   he's a he's a he's a trollish affect in the day he
[00:46:40.520 --> 00:46:43.720]   also attacked me Milo attacked me at length and then
[00:46:43.720 --> 00:46:47.400]   his publication went bankrupt he became for a brief while
[00:46:47.400 --> 00:46:51.320]   humble and nice and kind of okay and a little bit contrite
[00:46:51.320 --> 00:46:54.280]   but then went back to his but but he has this whole stick
[00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:58.760]   least he's not anonymous it's ironic that because he's not anonymous he can be
[00:46:58.760 --> 00:47:02.200]   banned right and he has the courage he has the courage
[00:47:02.200 --> 00:47:06.200]   to use his own name so well his handle is at Nero but
[00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:10.040]   he uses her current current using the word courage in this case puts you in
[00:47:10.040 --> 00:47:14.520]   bill mar territory from well I literally correct well he's more courageous
[00:47:14.520 --> 00:47:19.320]   than the trolls who don't use their real names yeah I'm fine and
[00:47:19.320 --> 00:47:23.240]   and I mean if you're going to troll you what at least use your real name because
[00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:26.360]   then you're standing behind your still but but Twitter Twitter no
[00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:29.800]   the way this way Leo Twitter bans thousands upon thousands upon
[00:47:29.800 --> 00:47:34.120]   thousands of egg accounts this one just happens to have a name
[00:47:34.120 --> 00:47:38.360]   if they ban the thousands of accounts that that don't have a real name then
[00:47:38.360 --> 00:47:41.320]   why should one that does have a real name be treated any differently if
[00:47:41.320 --> 00:47:45.080]   the behavior is equally heinous in Twitter's rules
[00:47:45.080 --> 00:47:49.080]   but it isn't it isn't equal I mean I think to a very large extent they banned
[00:47:49.080 --> 00:47:53.080]   Milo because of because he influenced other people to do
[00:47:53.080 --> 00:47:56.760]   super horrible that's a that's a heinous behavior in my book
[00:47:56.760 --> 00:48:02.040]   well I mean it's so I've been I've been a cute like for example I've
[00:48:02.040 --> 00:48:06.200]   let's say four years ago I would be defending
[00:48:06.200 --> 00:48:10.600]   Google+ and criticizing a writer who got a whole bunch of things wrong about
[00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:14.920]   Google+ and then a whole bunch of Google+
[00:48:14.920 --> 00:48:18.920]   fundamentalist fanatics went after that writer with all kind of vitriol and
[00:48:18.920 --> 00:48:22.360]   stuff that I didn't want them to do and I specifically asked them not to but
[00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:26.680]   they did it as a sort of like they felt encouraged by what I had done
[00:48:26.680 --> 00:48:30.600]   and that's not the case with Milo he's a he's a foul person he's a
[00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:36.120]   he's like a professional provocateur he loves the reaction he loves to get
[00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:39.720]   people outraged I think as with all trolls that's
[00:48:39.720 --> 00:48:44.680]   I well I can only speculate but I think that's part of the payoff right
[00:48:44.680 --> 00:48:47.720]   but the problem with Twitter is that they don't have clear guidelines I mean for
[00:48:47.720 --> 00:48:53.000]   example I'm bothered by trolls who set up an account where the sole purpose of
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:56.840]   that account is to attack a single person that should be something that can be
[00:48:56.840 --> 00:49:00.440]   established and and well okay as somebody who is the
[00:49:00.440 --> 00:49:05.480]   target of such a continual exactly I don't think they can the person
[00:49:05.480 --> 00:49:10.120]   it's not particularly difficult to use tools that
[00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:14.280]   obfuscate your account and so you just create a new email account
[00:49:14.280 --> 00:49:17.960]   you should take time to do that and it should be harder to do
[00:49:17.960 --> 00:49:20.600]   yeah but some people are motivated to spend the time it's it's
[00:49:20.600 --> 00:49:23.480]   I'm sure much easier for us to block him than it is
[00:49:23.480 --> 00:49:26.280]   for him to create the account but it doesn't seem to deter him
[00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:29.880]   the biggest problem is that is that Twitter is like Pokemon Go
[00:49:29.880 --> 00:49:35.000]   the content is just out there and so on Facebook or Google+ or other
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:39.080]   social networks you start a conversation you Leo Le Porte start a conversation
[00:49:39.080 --> 00:49:42.200]   and then it's like okay this is the space where we're talking about Leo Le Porte
[00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:45.720]   stuff and then people add comments to your posts
[00:49:45.720 --> 00:49:50.200]   and when somebody's a troll you block there you delete their
[00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:55.000]   comment you delete their reply you block them from participating in any
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:59.880]   future comments under your posts on Twitter that doesn't happen when you
[00:49:59.880 --> 00:50:04.360]   block somebody on Twitter when you block somebody on Facebook or Google+
[00:50:04.360 --> 00:50:06.920]   they leave the room when you block somebody on Twitter
[00:50:06.920 --> 00:50:10.360]   you leave the room right right and you just Twitter solution is
[00:50:10.360 --> 00:50:15.080]   oh just mute or block them and then you they won't bother you
[00:50:15.080 --> 00:50:19.320]   and the reason I don't do that is because then they're continuing to do it
[00:50:19.320 --> 00:50:23.640]   and everybody else sees it I don't see it that doesn't solve the problem
[00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:26.840]   Twitter puts I need to know what's going on pop role they need to
[00:50:26.840 --> 00:50:30.920]   empower users to be able to take action against people who are
[00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:33.960]   infiltrating their community infiltrating their conversations
[00:50:33.960 --> 00:50:37.080]   you can need to be able to own your conversations on Twitter like you can
[00:50:37.080 --> 00:50:40.520]   on Facebook and elsewhere and then have some controls on moderation
[00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:44.280]   control now make a huge difference so I want to understand this
[00:50:44.280 --> 00:50:47.800]   because my attitude has been basically there's nothing
[00:50:47.800 --> 00:50:50.600]   that can be done this is the nature of Twitter
[00:50:50.600 --> 00:50:55.000]   and in Twitter you know made their bed when they created it and of course
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:57.800]   they didn't know what they were getting into so I don't blame them
[00:50:57.800 --> 00:51:01.400]   but but the way they've structured it it's not possible to fix this problem
[00:51:01.400 --> 00:51:04.360]   but we'll keep it on the table tell me what well I just want to hear
[00:51:04.360 --> 00:51:08.440]   I want Mike to explain it I know he did but I want to understand it
[00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:12.680]   what is the simple fix that would fix this that Facebook does for instance
[00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:17.160]   is less simple a new kind of blocking well there this is well the notification
[00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:22.120]   comes in if everyone can be verified no that removes anonymity for Twitter
[00:51:22.120 --> 00:51:26.760]   Twitter can't do that hold on okay if everyone can be verified you can
[00:51:26.760 --> 00:51:31.080]   choose to look at only the verified well I can do that now
[00:51:31.080 --> 00:51:33.960]   well but that's a tiny tiny tiny group of celebrities
[00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:37.000]   that means celebrity but but well no they've done that they did by the way
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:39.720]   they just did that that's what I'm saying that's what I'm saying so I can see
[00:51:39.720 --> 00:51:42.520]   the beginnings of a strategy that says okay there's two
[00:51:42.520 --> 00:51:46.040]   Twitters there's a verified real name Twitter which they're going to
[00:51:46.040 --> 00:51:49.960]   presume is higher civility and then there's why right on Twitter
[00:51:49.960 --> 00:51:53.560]   solves this problem well let me let me give you this problem and I'd love to
[00:51:53.560 --> 00:51:55.880]   hear what how Twitter could solve this problem
[00:51:55.880 --> 00:52:00.680]   so there's a fella who targets me with really vile stuff and then at the
[00:52:00.680 --> 00:52:05.320]   same time tweets sponsors and future guests
[00:52:05.320 --> 00:52:09.640]   with with with vile stuff trying to discourage them from buying he's
[00:52:09.640 --> 00:52:12.600]   basically trying to put us out of business single-handedly trying to put
[00:52:12.600 --> 00:52:15.880]   us out of business what's the fix for that obviously me
[00:52:15.880 --> 00:52:18.920]   blocking him doesn't fix it because the sponsors
[00:52:18.920 --> 00:52:21.800]   but there should have structures to know by the way I think you all know
[00:52:21.800 --> 00:52:24.680]   I'm talking about because I know he's tweeted all of you exactly and you
[00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:27.880]   know by the way Virginia Heffernan almost didn't come on
[00:52:27.880 --> 00:52:32.200]   because she the guy she was told that I was a sexist pig and likely to
[00:52:32.200 --> 00:52:37.160]   ambush interview her and she was girded she said oh I'm ready and she had a
[00:52:37.160 --> 00:52:41.800]   lot of responses to my sexist pig my potential
[00:52:41.800 --> 00:52:46.600]   sexist big comments to her so I mean you know if Twitter cared enough how
[00:52:46.600 --> 00:52:50.680]   do you fix that okay when I when I block that person and I always
[00:52:50.680 --> 00:52:54.040]   report them to Twitter I do Twitter the favor of reporting them right
[00:52:54.040 --> 00:52:58.520]   there are clear patterns clear and easy patterns that would allow
[00:52:58.520 --> 00:53:02.040]   Twitter to put a flag on some account before we get started and starts doing
[00:53:02.040 --> 00:53:05.080]   this you know he does is what's interesting okay first of all the
[00:53:05.080 --> 00:53:08.120]   guy's fairly sophisticated he has one account that he knows we'll get
[00:53:08.120 --> 00:53:12.600]   blocked each time because it's it's clearly offensive so you know who
[00:53:12.600 --> 00:53:17.400]   it is no but uh well you can't because he's smart enough to
[00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:20.520]   remain anonymous um and then he has a second account which
[00:53:20.520 --> 00:53:24.680]   never crosses the line we can't block because it's parody account you know
[00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:28.520]   about that Jeff because oh yeah so he never crosses the line
[00:53:28.520 --> 00:53:31.800]   so he can't be blocked uh and he's smart enough to have both of those
[00:53:31.800 --> 00:53:34.760]   because it's very effective he can attack us on two fronts
[00:53:34.760 --> 00:53:38.440]   but Twitter should be saying what with if he's if he's if he's
[00:53:38.440 --> 00:53:41.480]   let's just say that he could fix the address he's smart enough probably
[00:53:41.480 --> 00:53:45.800]   no he does not use the same IP address he obfuscates his identity entirely
[00:53:45.800 --> 00:53:49.000]   once if you could prove once that the guy who does all these horrid things
[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:52.920]   it gets blocked is the same guy who does that then that that's what you
[00:53:52.920 --> 00:53:55.480]   said if you're betting for life you're betting for life at all forms but
[00:53:55.480 --> 00:53:58.360]   you can't pay it if he uses a different IP address and email each time
[00:53:58.360 --> 00:54:01.720]   there are patterns let me let me hear my fix
[00:54:01.720 --> 00:54:06.360]   why don't you like spot structural fix okay there are multiple things so so
[00:54:06.360 --> 00:54:09.560]   normal social networks like Facebook and Google+ and others
[00:54:09.560 --> 00:54:14.200]   um do a combination of they delete accounts when they violate certain
[00:54:14.200 --> 00:54:17.080]   guidelines and the question is what are those guidelines
[00:54:17.080 --> 00:54:20.600]   and then they also let you delete comments to people who have commented
[00:54:20.600 --> 00:54:24.120]   on your stuff and you can block people from ever commenting on your stuff
[00:54:24.120 --> 00:54:27.800]   again and those are both very powerful in the case of you and your troll and
[00:54:27.800 --> 00:54:32.120]   jeff you and your troll um they're in my opinion
[00:54:32.120 --> 00:54:36.120]   stepping over the line so for example the professor that shall not be named
[00:54:36.120 --> 00:54:40.440]   is clearly it's not a legitimate parody account because
[00:54:40.440 --> 00:54:44.600]   the name that he uses is exactly what would be legitimately used to refer to
[00:54:44.600 --> 00:54:48.120]   you and so that right there should be like that is not parody that somebody
[00:54:48.120 --> 00:54:50.920]   who's trying to confuse an obvious gate and boom out he goes
[00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:55.720]   in case of you Leo um you know this is a person who's clearly
[00:54:55.720 --> 00:54:58.920]   targeting you personally your business your guests
[00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:03.320]   so clear and obviously there should be clear rules it'd be easy to write i'd
[00:55:03.320 --> 00:55:05.400]   be happy to write them and take me 20 minutes
[00:55:05.400 --> 00:55:09.320]   that would identify that kind of line crossing and boom they're gone it should
[00:55:09.320 --> 00:55:13.320]   also take some time you should have to rise like pokemon go
[00:55:13.320 --> 00:55:17.320]   like levels to the point where you are trusted in certain ways and
[00:55:17.320 --> 00:55:20.680]   know how to exactly structure that so that's that's that set of problem
[00:55:20.680 --> 00:55:24.120]   no but it doesn't solve it because he comes in each time under a different
[00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:27.400]   uh he's not identifiable the pattern of what he says is clear well now you're
[00:55:27.400 --> 00:55:32.360]   asking for some sophisticated's what do you want twitter to run scaling that
[00:55:32.360 --> 00:55:35.880]   to 300 million users you want to know but yeah you want twitter to do
[00:55:35.880 --> 00:55:39.960]   semantic analysis on each new account you don't have to scale it
[00:55:39.960 --> 00:55:43.880]   because if anybody gets user a moderator of their own site
[00:55:43.880 --> 00:55:47.480]   essentially then twitter doesn't have to do it all they don't have to be on the
[00:55:47.480 --> 00:55:49.480]   present i mean every twitter's never going to do this
[00:55:49.480 --> 00:55:52.920]   beat they don't want to do it and it's i mean i i think we should all leave
[00:55:52.920 --> 00:55:56.360]   twitter well i would love to but they okay so here's another problem
[00:55:56.360 --> 00:55:59.480]   i could leave twitter but if they don't
[00:55:59.480 --> 00:56:03.400]   and they and they continue to do that then where have i gained it's the same
[00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:06.680]   thing as as muting them i don't i'm not seeing it
[00:56:06.680 --> 00:56:09.080]   but did you file a lawsuit and then against
[00:56:09.080 --> 00:56:10.120]   him
[00:56:10.120 --> 00:56:13.800]   well so that's you would have to go through probably twitter
[00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:18.120]   or julian it'd be you can't because i can tell you right now i i haven't
[00:56:18.120 --> 00:56:22.280]   checked but i'm sure he's using uh tor and other uh anonymizing technologies
[00:56:22.280 --> 00:56:26.920]   that would prevent uh any subpoena from being i have done this by the way uh
[00:56:26.920 --> 00:56:31.240]   some years ago somebody uh tweeted a rape threat and a murder and a rape
[00:56:31.240 --> 00:56:34.760]   threat against my daughter uh so my under at the time my underage
[00:56:34.760 --> 00:56:38.680]   daughter and uh we went to the local police and because
[00:56:38.680 --> 00:56:41.480]   you know that's by the way the only time the police get involved is if you're
[00:56:41.480 --> 00:56:44.200]   if there's a legitimate fear for your safety
[00:56:44.200 --> 00:56:47.400]   you know you have to have a death threat then they won't always get involved
[00:56:47.400 --> 00:56:50.600]   and they won't always we were very lucky we had a local police officer here in
[00:56:50.600 --> 00:56:55.000]   petaluma who agreed to pursue it he got a court order
[00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:58.920]   went to twitter because i asked i asked to have i said have your father of a
[00:56:58.920 --> 00:57:01.240]   daughter this this guy did as have didn't
[00:57:01.240 --> 00:57:04.280]   wouldn't and what he would i understand why he's not gonna send a president
[00:57:04.280 --> 00:57:08.840]   he's not gonna do me a favor so uh we went to the police the police did get
[00:57:08.840 --> 00:57:12.440]   the subpoena what they got was the ip address
[00:57:12.440 --> 00:57:17.880]   from twitter they then had to figure out who the isp was
[00:57:17.880 --> 00:57:21.880]   get another subpoena in that jurisdiction that required him going to chicago
[00:57:21.880 --> 00:57:25.000]   police and again convincing them to get a
[00:57:25.000 --> 00:57:29.960]   subpoena from a judge in that jurisdiction to the isp to say whose account is
[00:57:29.960 --> 00:57:33.800]   who's who is this ip address they tracked it down it was a
[00:57:33.800 --> 00:57:36.920]   young boy fifteen-year-old boy
[00:57:36.920 --> 00:57:41.320]   un-prosecutable so the chicago police knocked on his door and said
[00:57:41.320 --> 00:57:44.920]   it told his dad and his dad yelled at him and that it was the end of that
[00:57:44.920 --> 00:57:50.280]   uh first of all of a lot of effort
[00:57:50.280 --> 00:57:55.240]   very low potential for success it did succeed
[00:57:55.240 --> 00:57:58.120]   and there you have it now maybe you know the best i can hope for is maybe that
[00:57:58.120 --> 00:58:02.600]   kid is not going to be a stalker and a abuser in in his future life maybe we
[00:58:02.600 --> 00:58:06.120]   said we nipped it in the bud this actually is a really
[00:58:06.120 --> 00:58:09.880]   this is one reason why people should speak up against harassers
[00:58:09.880 --> 00:58:15.400]   or showcase these things because what if the person by the way lives in another
[00:58:15.400 --> 00:58:19.640]   country which i believe he does that that's that is an issue but it helps
[00:58:19.640 --> 00:58:22.680]   strengthen our laws in the physical world
[00:58:22.680 --> 00:58:28.040]   around harassment which are fairly weak um so if you think about
[00:58:28.920 --> 00:58:33.000]   your experience in that you know imagine if you didn't have you weren't lucky
[00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:37.240]   that way in honestly physical harassment is just as difficult
[00:58:37.240 --> 00:58:40.360]   not just as right it's very difficult that's right
[00:58:40.360 --> 00:58:44.840]   so it it's important to say hey this is an issue it's important for people like
[00:58:44.840 --> 00:58:47.960]   you to say this is an issue so we can fix it maybe not just
[00:58:47.960 --> 00:58:52.440]   at twitter but like your police officers should not have to you know
[00:58:52.440 --> 00:58:56.440]   there should be something to help them do something like that across state lines
[00:58:56.440 --> 00:59:01.000]   so you don't have to actually visit chicago or but there isn't none of this
[00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:04.840]   exists none of this is ever likely to exist
[00:59:04.840 --> 00:59:08.600]   so let me ask you this by the way what i almost don't want to show you i don't
[00:59:08.600 --> 00:59:11.400]   want to show you this and if if you're easily offended
[00:59:11.400 --> 00:59:15.320]   uh hide your eyes either you don't want to show it i don't want to show it
[00:59:15.320 --> 00:59:18.520]   okay because he just tweeted of course he loved the
[00:59:18.520 --> 00:59:21.720]   attention and normally i don't talk about it because why you know i don't
[00:59:21.720 --> 00:59:27.160]   got i don't need to feed the beast um you know i just don't i
[00:59:27.160 --> 00:59:30.040]   well it's an issue i don't i think it's intractable i don't think it's insoluble
[00:59:30.040 --> 00:59:33.240]   i think as long as something like twitter exists that allows an
[00:59:33.240 --> 00:59:36.040]   uh now one thing that may be worth the conversation
[00:59:36.040 --> 00:59:41.960]   is should an anonymity be allowed ever yes yes yes it is it is not
[00:59:41.960 --> 00:59:45.080]   an imity for the terrorist themselves then you're gonna have this no matter
[00:59:45.080 --> 00:59:47.000]   what then this is okay well let me try the question
[00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:51.160]   different way if you own twitter and you're a responsible person
[00:59:52.120 --> 00:59:56.280]   would you do anything differently well that's what i'm asking uh absolutely
[00:59:56.280 --> 01:00:00.280]   the level up scheme i really like yeah i haven't thought this through
[01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:05.560]   but i like the idea of giving people different levels of trust maybe
[01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:08.920]   different circles and i don't want to cross circles of trust that sounds so
[01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:14.680]   our sponsors when they get tweeted at we we instruct them okay check the
[01:00:14.680 --> 01:00:17.960]   how long it's been around how many followers there are you see nobody
[01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:21.480]   saw this um and you know you're gonna
[01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:25.800]   get a kill probably one of our sponsors wanted to put out a press release
[01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:30.680]   jeez and we said you know no one has seen this until you put out a press release
[01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:36.440]   so it's an effect yeah but so there's most i mean you're sophisticated stacy
[01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:40.120]   and uh and you would understand some sort of
[01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:43.720]   you know karma points thing but most people i mean there is a karma point
[01:00:43.720 --> 01:00:46.520]   saying how long is that account been around how many followers do they have
[01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:50.680]   what are the other tweets you could easily look at that and go oh well that's
[01:00:50.680 --> 01:00:55.160]   obviously a bogus account people don't and even sophisticated people like
[01:00:55.160 --> 01:00:57.720]   virginia heffernan don't
[01:00:57.720 --> 01:01:01.080]   we might students be able to conversation my students say what do they say when i
[01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:05.800]   add my case ignore it exposes them they're out there's nothing you can do i just
[01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:07.640]   find that
[01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:12.280]   too sad i i mean that's my attitude as well i don't i just don't think it's that
[01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:15.800]   complicated it's just you should be able to when you block somebody they
[01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:19.400]   should no longer be able to at mention you
[01:01:19.400 --> 01:01:22.040]   turning that they should no longer be able to use
[01:01:22.040 --> 01:01:25.960]   a hashtag that uses your name okay but they could still tweet my sponsor with
[01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:30.760]   my real name right but you can you should be able to demonstrate that they've
[01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:34.200]   been they've that you've blocked them that you know we do and that's how what we
[01:01:34.200 --> 01:01:37.480]   have but with what means is we spent we have called a sponsor
[01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:42.200]   or they'll call us and say but you know you understand this is twitter
[01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:47.000]   people don't know this about twitter even sophisticated people who ought to know
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:51.800]   better don't know this about twitter they think it's twitter it's great
[01:01:51.800 --> 01:01:55.240]   maybe it's something that people will have to learn over time maybe it's a
[01:01:55.240 --> 01:01:59.480]   generational thing i i don't know um i know that my
[01:01:59.480 --> 01:02:03.240]   daughter is even at nine is far more sophisticated than i would imagine
[01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:07.320]   her to be um so battle cam and our charamestings something i
[01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:10.120]   completely agree with he said the same mechanism people use
[01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:14.840]   to attack others is used on a daily basis to get a company's attention and i
[01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:17.320]   would submit getting a company's attention for a problem
[01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:20.280]   by a legitimate person happens far more than using it as abuse and i would
[01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:25.720]   agree and in fact that's why twitter is valuable because it's most of the time
[01:02:25.720 --> 01:02:28.920]   used for in a very valuable way we wouldn't want to lose it
[01:02:28.920 --> 01:02:33.400]   but in but it i think structurally and endemically it has a flaw
[01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:38.200]   that is never going to go away yeah is that open this and then the
[01:02:38.200 --> 01:02:42.360]   further that is openness has that law period so back to the other
[01:02:42.360 --> 01:02:45.880]   back to banning my love yet the tragedy of twitter comments
[01:02:45.880 --> 01:02:49.240]   exactly back to banning my love you know please
[01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:54.120]   is that is that the right thing to do is it can curtailing free speech
[01:02:54.120 --> 01:03:00.840]   in my opinion i mean it's he's a vile horrible thing what he's doing but he's
[01:03:00.840 --> 01:03:05.080]   doing it under his real name which at i've heard her has a right to say what
[01:03:05.080 --> 01:03:07.720]   goes out under its brand of course they can wish twitter had higher
[01:03:07.720 --> 01:03:10.360]   standards and so that's not a matter of free speech
[01:03:10.360 --> 01:03:13.800]   that's a matter of twitter having its own speech twitter also has a right to
[01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:17.400]   edit magazines have a right to edit they shouldn't be forced to publish
[01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:21.640]   things they don't want to publish and that's what they're doing in this case
[01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:26.680]   say say sorry no i'm thinking this through um oh that's rare for this show
[01:03:26.680 --> 01:03:29.720]   i mean we never do that i know i'm terrible at that um
[01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:35.000]   so you can't like incite a riot in the and again this is this is where laws are
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:39.560]   country specific if you built standards that kind of
[01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:42.680]   talked about inciting other people to harass versus
[01:03:42.680 --> 01:03:46.040]   saying vile stupid things that you just think
[01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:49.800]   maybe that's a way to get around maybe that's when you
[01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:54.680]   ban someone like milo who is you know who does have a right to free speech but
[01:03:54.680 --> 01:03:59.320]   when does it cross the line to like yeah
[01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:02.200]   i guess yelling fire in a crowded theater or that's actually not the right
[01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:06.440]   analogy it's it's um he doesn't have a right to free speech on
[01:04:06.440 --> 01:04:10.120]   twitter he has no right to say what he wants to on twitter
[01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:14.040]   feels like he's a platform for free speech if twitter as a commercial
[01:04:14.040 --> 01:04:17.560]   entity that owns the platform decides that's a right they want to enforce or
[01:04:17.560 --> 01:04:20.840]   decides to quote unquote make it a right then he has it
[01:04:20.840 --> 01:04:23.560]   i mean that's kind of what we're arguing is how twitter
[01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:27.480]   creates rights or well but twitter has standards
[01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:30.280]   right and so twitter is set online it was standard now i think what leo is saying
[01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:34.760]   is is that why i don't make any sense because what they did was ban somebody
[01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:39.320]   who put his name on versus a million people who don't
[01:04:39.320 --> 01:04:42.040]   they they don't really have standards because essentially they they have
[01:04:42.040 --> 01:04:46.360]   standards and then they they're essentially banned
[01:04:46.360 --> 01:04:51.720]   uh milo who has done thing you know they're they're far worse people that they
[01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:54.840]   don't ban they ban them because it was a pr problem and they ban him because they
[01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:58.280]   could ban him they can't ban the people who are
[01:04:58.280 --> 01:05:02.040]   anonymous the solution is not to silence
[01:05:02.040 --> 01:05:08.040]   people it's to marginalize them the problem is that a troll can have as much
[01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:12.360]   uh sort of like attention as the celebrity themselves
[01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:15.000]   especially when celebrities are retweeting them
[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:19.080]   um but but the solution is to is to marginalize
[01:05:19.080 --> 01:05:24.360]   through just tweaking the system as it exists so i think i think all you really
[01:05:24.360 --> 01:05:27.560]   need to do is have a system that sort of pushes
[01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:32.040]   um making pushes people out to the wilderness if they're like sort of
[01:05:32.040 --> 01:05:35.560]   objectionable to to the people who they're talking about
[01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:39.320]   right so that's that already exists on most other social networks it's not
[01:05:39.320 --> 01:05:42.040]   that complicated i think twitter could easily do it
[01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:44.760]   why don't they
[01:05:44.760 --> 01:05:48.280]   because it it changes something that's unique about twitter
[01:05:48.280 --> 01:05:53.480]   i mean i mean i'm from every time i block this guy i provide them with all the
[01:05:53.480 --> 01:05:57.880]   previous handles uh if if they really wanted to they could in fact have there
[01:05:57.880 --> 01:06:01.160]   is a very concrete pattern he's actually just repeats his
[01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:04.920]   mindsets over and over again so what if they charge you for more accounts
[01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:07.480]   i guess you just start a new email account nevermind if you're really
[01:06:07.480 --> 01:06:10.680]   dedicated you're gonna get through it here's the real problem somebody who's
[01:06:10.680 --> 01:06:14.440]   really dedicated somebody who's really like this is so dedicated i don't know
[01:06:14.440 --> 01:06:17.320]   it's like what's well that's the question it's like
[01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:21.320]   you're spending so much more time on this i don't understand why it
[01:06:21.320 --> 01:06:25.320]   just like baffles me i don't it's just so we shouldn't use him as our
[01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:28.680]   is our but there's many hymns not just i mean you shouldn't use me as an
[01:06:28.680 --> 01:06:32.120]   example there are many many many people like this apparently
[01:06:32.120 --> 01:06:35.960]   for instance there's a i i'm seeing a lot of hashtag free milo
[01:06:35.960 --> 01:06:39.960]   stuff and it's it's you know by the way this is oddly conflated with gamer
[01:06:39.960 --> 01:06:43.960]   gate apparent i don't understand this because milo had opinions about gamer
[01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:48.920]   gate and you can imagine what they were yeah and and uh
[01:06:48.920 --> 01:06:52.520]   um apparently the it's the some of the same people gamer gate don't want a
[01:06:52.520 --> 01:06:56.840]   female cast ghost bust what is whole what is so sacred about ghost
[01:06:56.840 --> 01:07:01.240]   busters uh it can't be remade every other movie in the
[01:07:01.240 --> 01:07:04.680]   world including the first star wars which is essentially remade by the newest
[01:07:04.680 --> 01:07:09.880]   star wars has been remade uh it's so strong i don't
[01:07:09.880 --> 01:07:13.960]   i don't i don't get people's obsessions i think what partly this is is that these
[01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:17.240]   people have always i would guess have always existed
[01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:21.640]   but never had a platform so we just there we you know we just haven't been that
[01:07:21.640 --> 01:07:25.480]   aware of them they've been and we make a mistake of encouraging them
[01:07:25.480 --> 01:07:29.320]   i fight that happens all too well and that's usually why i don't i'm
[01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:32.600]   breaking my absolute i know i know i mentioned this at all
[01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:37.160]   but i mean i think i just put up a piece uh in the chat uh or in the in the
[01:07:37.160 --> 01:07:41.960]   rundown chat uh from uh adi Robertson at to the verge
[01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:45.320]   who argues the problem is the twitter is being vague about this this is also a
[01:07:45.320 --> 01:07:49.480]   matter of standards and we don't know what those standards are i think
[01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:52.760]   facebook does a okay job of setting standards you know
[01:07:52.760 --> 01:07:56.440]   no matter what no naked breasts well except for breastfeeding but
[01:07:56.440 --> 01:08:01.000]   not otherwise no well except for post-operative but otherwise no
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:05.240]   remember they do set a line uh they try to do things around live and so
[01:08:05.240 --> 01:08:08.360]   and so are they try to set lines so that they can point to those lines
[01:08:08.360 --> 01:08:12.360]   the problem that the the adi Robertson has here is that
[01:08:12.360 --> 01:08:15.880]   twitter's vague about this they're not saying what the standard was or
[01:08:15.880 --> 01:08:19.080]   how can we enforce this in the future or what is it about my law and i i do
[01:08:19.080 --> 01:08:22.760]   got some i think that's a decent point selective enforcement is always a
[01:08:22.760 --> 01:08:25.960]   problem with when you're up yeah for instance as a parent i know this is a
[01:08:25.960 --> 01:08:29.160]   parent if you if you punish some behavior but not others it
[01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:32.920]   confuses the hell out of your kids and i think jeff you give facebook way too
[01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:38.200]   much credit in those cases you specified those policies were
[01:08:38.200 --> 01:08:43.080]   created as and only as the direct result of bad PR
[01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:45.480]   that's the only thing that caused those policies they
[01:08:45.480 --> 01:08:48.840]   they just filed forward let's let's not call it bad PR let's talk
[01:08:48.840 --> 01:08:51.960]   let's call it you know feedback from the community
[01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:55.720]   uh huh well seriously like people complained about it
[01:08:55.720 --> 01:08:58.680]   and then otherwise it wouldn't be bad PR right
[01:08:58.680 --> 01:09:03.080]   that's why this is so difficult incidentally because it is free speech
[01:09:03.080 --> 01:09:07.640]   right um people should have the right to complain even if you disagree and
[01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:09.960]   Milo should have the right for him to have his
[01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:13.480]   bizarre political beliefs even if you disagree and he should be allowed to have
[01:09:13.480 --> 01:09:15.720]   that one so it's not it's not it's not from the twitter
[01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:18.920]   it's not the right but to the left no i understand the free speech in the
[01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:22.680]   sense of government shall not make a law to restrict speech
[01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:26.200]   it's just the free speech but but we live in a world where we
[01:09:26.200 --> 01:09:28.920]   kind of want to encourage people to be able to speak freely
[01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:32.040]   even if their opinions diverge from ours it's different i'm not talking about the
[01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:35.240]   first amendment style free speech but it's just the general notion but but
[01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:38.200]   think of think of in terms of we have our home we have
[01:09:38.200 --> 01:09:43.560]   so so jeff is a new york socialite uh the the the bell of the ball and has these
[01:09:43.560 --> 01:09:47.240]   party massive cocktail parties that are just everybody's talking about them all
[01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:51.400]   the time and he has the right to to invite who he wants into his living room to
[01:09:51.400 --> 01:09:54.760]   have these cocktail parties and the right to next time he has one to
[01:09:54.760 --> 01:09:58.200]   not invite that person because they got drunk and they they tripped over the
[01:09:58.200 --> 01:10:01.160]   couch and all that kind of stuff so next time he doesn't have to invite them and
[01:10:01.160 --> 01:10:04.840]   everybody supports his right to do that i think that social network should be
[01:10:04.840 --> 01:10:08.840]   like a cocktail party you should have the right to create one space on the whole
[01:10:08.840 --> 01:10:12.440]   of the internet that's just yours and you can interact with just the people you
[01:10:12.440 --> 01:10:16.120]   want to interact with and anybody who if you're a semi-public figure or a
[01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:19.880]   public figure or a celebrity or famous like jeff jarvis you should be able to
[01:10:19.880 --> 01:10:23.720]   carve out this space and say okay you know what you're not invited out you go
[01:10:23.720 --> 01:10:27.960]   and and have and so that when people want to interfere with you and your
[01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:31.720]   community they would they can only really do it from inside your
[01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:35.800]   cocktail party inside of your little space and twitter there is no little space
[01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:39.880]   we're all outside wandering around like pokemon go players
[01:10:39.880 --> 01:10:43.400]   clawing and scratching at each other with no control over who
[01:10:43.400 --> 01:10:47.400]   is at our cocktail party it's like having a cocktail party where the law requires
[01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:51.720]   anyone can come i think you should start
[01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:55.480]   um google did but they everybody nobody wanted it
[01:10:55.480 --> 01:10:58.840]   oh well then there we go
[01:11:00.680 --> 01:11:05.400]   well played well played are you still using google plus mic
[01:11:05.400 --> 01:11:09.560]   i do i do that it's it's getting weird because
[01:11:09.560 --> 01:11:13.800]   uh the sort of english speaking you know originally it was kind of a
[01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:17.000]   elite site for very rainy people who super enthusiastic about what they're
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:21.080]   doing and little by little some of those people are wandering away but meanwhile
[01:11:21.080 --> 01:11:24.200]   lots and lots of other people who don't speak english so well are not really
[01:11:24.200 --> 01:11:27.080]   aware of what's going on don't really want to have conversations about what
[01:11:27.080 --> 01:11:30.680]   you post are creeping in so it's a very active site
[01:11:30.680 --> 01:11:33.880]   but the nature of the conversation is getting weird
[01:11:33.880 --> 01:11:37.880]   yeah um you know i post a picture of like a loaf of bread i'm like oh look at
[01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:41.480]   this great bread oh it's beautiful too i wanted it yeah three of three of four
[01:11:41.480 --> 01:11:45.720]   people five five people ten people reply with what is this
[01:11:45.720 --> 01:11:50.840]   it's red like i don't have you never seen red maybe they haven't
[01:11:50.840 --> 01:11:54.200]   and there are a lot of people post comments that it's clear that they
[01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:57.400]   can't see the post or the photo so they're like you know they're
[01:11:57.400 --> 01:11:59.560]   supposed to be like i think there's some strange
[01:11:59.560 --> 01:12:01.800]   bots that are every time there's a photo what's
[01:12:01.800 --> 01:12:04.440]   one finally threw me off was every time there was a photo there
[01:12:04.440 --> 01:12:10.680]   you got uh you know 30 posts from asia just saying oh wow oh how nice
[01:12:10.680 --> 01:12:14.920]   and yeah there's you know api though why how would this work
[01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:18.600]   i don't know i don't know there's there's a certain type of vietnamese
[01:12:18.600 --> 01:12:23.000]   Vietnamese post that uses five or six words from your post and then trails
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:27.400]   off in the vietnamese um here's the bread does that not look good
[01:12:27.400 --> 01:12:31.160]   yeah does it not look like bread like who who in the world would not say oh that
[01:12:31.160 --> 01:12:36.120]   it's a lot so van tongue fam says wtop i don't even
[01:12:36.120 --> 01:12:40.920]   know what that is michael are you located yeah michael holland says hello
[01:12:40.920 --> 01:12:44.440]   charles and again these are blue hats like look at how many people don't have
[01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:48.840]   charles cockadoodle do he's big right so that's that's what it's become and
[01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:53.160]   where are you located it's uh i mean i i sometimes i go through the
[01:12:53.160 --> 01:12:56.920]   notifications feature and and a post from like three years ago will
[01:12:56.920 --> 01:13:01.880]   surface and it has like 600 you know it has like 450 comments
[01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:09.240]   and 13 000 plus ones and i'm like boy those are the days
[01:13:09.240 --> 01:13:13.800]   well by the way twitter has a similar problem because if you look at if you
[01:13:13.800 --> 01:13:17.080]   look at your uh mentions where people have
[01:13:17.080 --> 01:13:22.120]   mentioned you favorited you retweeted you bizarre of old tweets of minor you
[01:13:22.120 --> 01:13:26.440]   know it's filled with bots usually uh attractive women in low cut
[01:13:26.440 --> 01:13:31.160]   dresses favoriting or retweeting old tweets of mine
[01:13:31.160 --> 01:13:33.880]   i have this horrible thing you know there's some some services that i
[01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:36.520]   can run see right now with the pull up yeah i've got one right here
[01:13:36.520 --> 01:13:41.000]   uh i i sometime ago i said the first step to blogging is not writing them
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.400]   at reading them so somebody made that into a into a
[01:13:43.400 --> 01:13:50.120]   gift and uh it's not always purely fake accounts but it's bs accounts
[01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:53.080]   and i see this thing popping up ten times a day
[01:13:53.080 --> 01:13:55.800]   two or three of these quotes pop up there's clearly no reason for them they're
[01:13:55.800 --> 01:13:59.400]   not really quoting me they're trying to prove to so to somebody's
[01:13:59.400 --> 01:14:03.000]   algorithm that they're real by seeming to have content
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:05.960]   and then they do other things right it's yeah that's the only thing i can
[01:14:05.960 --> 01:14:08.680]   figure out actually in the case of these women i think they just want
[01:14:08.680 --> 01:14:12.600]   people to see the avatar and then not women Leo i'm sorry
[01:14:12.600 --> 01:14:18.600]   Leo i'm sorry yeah sorry what but they're so cute
[01:14:18.600 --> 01:14:21.880]   and then i and then if you look at their twitter stream it's like yeah go to our
[01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:25.000]   site and see our stuff and that kind of it's spam
[01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:28.920]   they got you to click well only because they well is that was that the whole
[01:14:28.920 --> 01:14:32.760]   goal is to get me to click yes you it's confusing
[01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:38.360]   the uh i mean it's pretty onesy tosy that's talk about retail spam i mean
[01:14:38.360 --> 01:14:41.800]   uh that's a lot of work to get me to click
[01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:45.640]   maybe that's what they're doing all right let's take a break uh
[01:14:45.640 --> 01:14:49.000]   i'm very curious what the jeff javis has to say we've been fighting back and
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:53.160]   forth over google amp now amp is amping ads now i really
[01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:56.200]   wonder what jeff javis thinks about google amp i'll be curious what you have
[01:14:56.200 --> 01:15:01.000]   to say well at least they're speedy
[01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:04.760]   are you today bro these ads are not however
[01:15:04.760 --> 01:15:08.680]   should they brought to you by wealth front i love wealth front wealth front
[01:15:08.680 --> 01:15:12.600]   solves a problem everybody has or should have which is
[01:15:12.600 --> 01:15:17.080]   if you're saving for the long term uh your retirement college fund
[01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:22.280]   um buy in a house rainy day fund you got to invest it you can't just put it in
[01:15:22.280 --> 01:15:25.080]   the mattress you got to invest it but how are you going to do that you can keep
[01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:28.440]   track of it learn all you need to do to learn and
[01:15:28.440 --> 01:15:33.000]   and rebalance and monitor it regularly or you probably not right or you're going
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:36.920]   to go to a advisor and he'll take one two or three percent
[01:15:36.920 --> 01:15:40.360]   of what you've got under investment right off the top every year
[01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:43.240]   not to mention hidden fees transaction costs
[01:15:43.240 --> 01:15:46.520]   it's very hard to make any money that way
[01:15:46.520 --> 01:15:50.280]   so we got a better way and it's a computer doing the work on your behalf
[01:15:50.280 --> 01:15:53.640]   that's why it's cheap instead of one or two or three percent
[01:15:53.640 --> 01:15:57.320]   wealth front charges one quarter of one percent
[01:15:57.320 --> 01:16:01.960]   a year 25 basis points a year with never any additional fees any
[01:16:01.960 --> 01:16:05.800]   transaction fees any hidden fees that's all it costs
[01:16:05.800 --> 01:16:08.920]   that's less than five dollars a month investing a thirty thousand dollar
[01:16:08.920 --> 01:16:12.680]   account and do they pay attention to your account yes they do every minute of
[01:16:12.680 --> 01:16:16.600]   every day wealth front is rebalancing doing things like tax
[01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:21.640]   loss harvesting to maximize your return and minimize your tax
[01:16:21.640 --> 01:16:24.360]   uh it's incredible and of course you know exactly what it's doing at all
[01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:27.560]   times you can view and track all your accounts in one place even accounts that
[01:16:27.560 --> 01:16:31.000]   aren't wealth front accounts so you can see your whole net worth
[01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:34.440]   on the wealth front site or using the wealth front app
[01:16:34.440 --> 01:16:38.200]   every trade is on your dashboard it's amazing
[01:16:38.200 --> 01:16:42.040]   and it's based on the best research the smartest minds
[01:16:42.040 --> 01:16:46.840]   so it really really works they recently introduced their 529 college savings

[01:16:51.560 --> 01:16:55.080]   like a Roth IRA basically so if you're saving for a child or grandchild's
[01:16:55.080 --> 01:16:58.200]   higher expenses you want to you know you want to save and you want to get the

[01:18:06.040 --> 01:18:13.400]   wealthfront.com/twig can i add kind of a slightly related
[01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:16.200]   thing to the miles right in terms of having fake people
[01:18:16.200 --> 01:18:20.120]   yeah just just john green uh just put up a post saying this is more of the
[01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:24.040]   weirdest things is in a while uh now there's a lot of speculation
[01:18:24.040 --> 01:18:29.320]   the merit of mckiverer the uh millanias speechwriter yeah is not real
[01:18:29.320 --> 01:18:35.880]   what i just put it up no that can't be wow that's awesome
[01:18:35.880 --> 01:18:41.560]   so i had a theory worthy of mike elgin because i'm watching we're watching
[01:18:41.560 --> 01:18:47.560]   millanias speaker by the way not a knock on millania in any way i i feel very
[01:18:47.560 --> 01:18:51.720]   sorry for her she just that's this this is this is not her fault
[01:18:51.720 --> 01:18:57.240]   um but i'm watching and she says Donald is never gonna give you up
[01:18:57.240 --> 01:19:01.080]   he's never gonna let you down and i said i turned at least i said she just
[01:19:01.080 --> 01:19:05.400]   rick rolled us she said what she just rick rolled us
[01:19:05.400 --> 01:19:08.920]   and then and i didn't catch the plagiarism of course i heard about the next day
[01:19:08.920 --> 01:19:13.480]   but then i realized my theory was that a dick tuck remember dick tuck i'm sure
[01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:16.680]   you do jeff jarvis yeah the democratic prankster
[01:19:16.680 --> 01:19:20.920]   right right who got a number of pregnant african-american women to hold up the
[01:19:20.920 --> 01:19:25.800]   nixon the one signs it nixon's the one signs during the nixon
[01:19:25.800 --> 01:19:30.200]   right it was famous and he had a and he was puckish he was not uh he was not
[01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:34.120]   you know he was a dirty trickster but in a kind of humorous
[01:19:34.120 --> 01:19:38.200]   vein for uh hum free i guess it was in 1968
[01:19:38.200 --> 01:19:43.160]   anyway i thought you know what some dick tuck style guy
[01:19:43.160 --> 01:19:48.680]   wrote this knowing that millania wouldn't know and and we just read it
[01:19:48.680 --> 01:19:53.080]   so now roll of the year maybe what i mean we'll talk about a great troll
[01:19:53.080 --> 01:19:56.600]   uh anyway that was my that was my theory
[01:19:56.600 --> 01:20:01.800]   um uh i don't know what now so so then uh just this morning they finally said
[01:20:01.800 --> 01:20:04.920]   oh no you know what uh there there's a woman who's written some stuff
[01:20:04.920 --> 01:20:08.200]   for donald in the past millani was uncomfortable with the speech that was
[01:20:08.200 --> 01:20:11.720]   written for her by professional speech writers so she called this woman up
[01:20:11.720 --> 01:20:14.280]   and said help me write this speech the woman
[01:20:14.280 --> 01:20:17.560]   said okay well what tell me some speeches you were impressed by
[01:20:17.560 --> 01:20:20.440]   uh what you know what the kind of thing you'd like to say and and
[01:20:20.440 --> 01:20:24.200]   millania told her about michelle obama's in the 2008 convention speech
[01:20:24.200 --> 01:20:30.440]   should i like this one and um somehow text from that inadvertently and i
[01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:33.800]   believe that inadvertently got into the text of the speech
[01:20:33.800 --> 01:20:37.960]   although they're never going to give you up never gonna let you down
[01:20:37.960 --> 01:20:42.120]   i'm still i'm still like that is definitely a rick role
[01:20:42.120 --> 01:20:45.320]   yeah there's a lot of stuff that seems uh
[01:20:45.320 --> 01:20:50.280]   kind of trollish um when donald trump was introducing the vp candidate and of
[01:20:50.280 --> 01:20:53.320]   course there were rumors that he had last minute cold feet and kind of
[01:20:53.320 --> 01:20:57.640]   regretted my decision uh they they're playing the rolling stones uh you
[01:20:57.640 --> 01:21:02.600]   can't get what you want what the what like before he announced his vice
[01:21:02.600 --> 01:21:06.360]   presidential candidate the theme song is you can't always get what you want
[01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:09.560]   yeah but if you try some time you'll get what you need
[01:21:09.560 --> 01:21:12.840]   i want to believe that somebody is trolling i think there are some
[01:21:12.840 --> 01:21:16.360]   disaffected campaign workers is what i think but anyway yeah
[01:21:16.360 --> 01:21:20.920]   so now the latest is uh that this woman doesn't exist so the
[01:21:20.920 --> 01:21:25.000]   independent i put them both up at the bottom of the run that can't be true
[01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:30.840]   that no donald did pretend to be his own uh exactly his own pr do and they said
[01:21:30.840 --> 01:21:34.040]   they're not going to fire marinith makaiver
[01:21:34.040 --> 01:21:37.800]   is he can't fire a ghost and where is a picture of marinith makaiver
[01:21:37.800 --> 01:21:41.240]   well there's a picture there now piers morgan just came on to twitter saying
[01:21:41.240 --> 01:21:45.160]   that he dealt with her main times over the years okay so yeah i would
[01:21:45.160 --> 01:21:49.000]   i don't know just it's just there's nothing too bizarre in this bizarre
[01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:53.560]   election cycle but that one maybe is a little far yeah
[01:21:53.560 --> 01:21:57.560]   yeah so john green said you know john green the wonderful vidcon john green
[01:21:57.560 --> 01:22:01.000]   this marinith makaiver possibly that existing thing is even by the standards
[01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:05.640]   of 2006 american political discourse intensely weird
[01:22:05.640 --> 01:22:12.760]   yeah i love it yeah it's if nothing else it's enjoyable
[01:22:12.760 --> 01:22:19.320]   yeah well unless unless the worst happens and you know what uh i have to be
[01:22:19.320 --> 01:22:21.560]   careful here because even some of our employees are
[01:22:21.560 --> 01:22:25.960]   trump supporters so um and i'm happily married to a republican which i never
[01:22:25.960 --> 01:22:28.360]   thought i would be but you know what i just opened my mind
[01:22:28.360 --> 01:22:33.000]   no and i want to say that's opened my mind to the possibility that uh
[01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:39.320]   everything i hold dear is wrong so i had i had a moment with god uh this
[01:22:39.320 --> 01:22:42.440]   week i was i was down it was kind of a rough week but moving my parents into
[01:22:42.440 --> 01:22:46.520]   the into the retirement hearing care and that's what we're gonna get to
[01:22:46.520 --> 01:22:50.520]   front we're gonna get to frontier communications like oh man oh man so
[01:22:50.520 --> 01:22:52.600]   so one of the things i had a whole list of to-dos
[01:22:52.600 --> 01:22:56.520]   one of the things i did was was was changed their 40 to the post office
[01:22:56.520 --> 01:22:59.320]   you go on now and there's some service the post office sends you to the tries
[01:22:59.320 --> 01:23:01.480]   to send you all kinds of ads they're trying to make money on this
[01:23:01.480 --> 01:23:06.200]   basic government function whatever after it finishes with the address
[01:23:06.200 --> 01:23:10.520]   forwarding it says what you really need to update your voter registration do you
[01:23:10.520 --> 01:23:14.680]   want to do that nice faced god eye to eye because my
[01:23:14.680 --> 01:23:19.240]   parents are both fox news watching oh should you register that i said
[01:23:19.240 --> 01:23:25.880]   hmm oh oh uh i did it i read good man good man
[01:23:25.880 --> 01:23:30.200]   yeah but oh the election could be my fault
[01:23:30.200 --> 01:23:33.960]   now my parents my parents are the same way jeff and
[01:23:33.960 --> 01:23:38.040]   that's okay i i volunteered if i needed to to drive my parents to the polling
[01:23:38.040 --> 01:23:42.200]   good good oh and and run out of gas on the way
[01:23:42.200 --> 01:23:47.400]   i i tried i i think my tresslers ran out of power
[01:23:47.400 --> 01:23:53.640]   no stupid green machine oh you see you see we need
[01:23:53.640 --> 01:23:58.440]   more oil if they'd only approve that pipeline
[01:23:58.440 --> 01:24:03.000]   there you go uh okay can we not talk about politics anymore
[01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:06.840]   i know i i always resist it but it's so hard not to because i got such
[01:24:06.840 --> 01:24:10.600]   trouble it's so fascinating you're a journalist you should have absolutely
[01:24:10.600 --> 01:24:14.280]   no opinions you're disgusting there's also there's also a technology and
[01:24:14.280 --> 01:24:16.920]   social media dimension which is hard to avoid when you're
[01:24:16.920 --> 01:24:19.480]   talking about technical well and that's my
[01:24:19.480 --> 01:24:23.400]   some would say rationalization some would say rationale
[01:24:23.400 --> 01:24:27.960]   uh i i do feel like this is really an internet election in a great
[01:24:27.960 --> 01:24:32.040]   great degree and you can very much say that uh mr trump's
[01:24:32.040 --> 01:24:36.680]   success stems from his ability to directly address an audience
[01:24:36.680 --> 01:24:42.440]   in uh the internet era in a way that no prior uh candidate has been able to he
[01:24:42.440 --> 01:24:46.920]   he mastered the medium i think also that the internet has
[01:24:46.920 --> 01:24:51.160]   helped completely fragment us a lot more
[01:24:51.160 --> 01:24:55.560]   and that also helps him play two extremes
[01:24:55.560 --> 01:25:00.200]   that well sides really and the thing i have to remind myself is
[01:25:00.200 --> 01:25:03.240]   maybe he's playing two extremes maybe he's not my candidate
[01:25:03.240 --> 01:25:07.080]   but he got a lot of votes and there's a
[01:25:07.080 --> 01:25:10.520]   rew or any sanders versus well and the same thing with sanders and
[01:25:10.520 --> 01:25:13.080]   there's a reason there's there's some
[01:25:13.080 --> 01:25:16.520]   but he that's of somebody's voice somebody's opinion and i have to
[01:25:16.520 --> 01:25:19.320]   yes so two things about this layout number one
[01:25:19.320 --> 01:25:22.840]   a lot i would i would say a lot is relative 13 million people out of
[01:25:22.840 --> 01:25:25.720]   three hundred fifty million people is not a lot of americans
[01:25:25.720 --> 01:25:28.120]   who actually went to the trouble of voting for that camera right
[01:25:28.120 --> 01:25:32.120]   but we'll see but it's telling us this general of course but
[01:25:32.120 --> 01:25:35.640]   probably have and i've done this feel well before where i think we're at the
[01:25:35.640 --> 01:25:37.880]   end of the mass media business model which means we're at the end of the
[01:25:37.880 --> 01:25:41.400]   notion of the mass but we have institutions that depend upon the idea
[01:25:41.400 --> 01:25:45.640]   of the mass like political parties yeah yeah there's two parties
[01:25:45.640 --> 01:25:48.360]   and we're all going to be clumped in one of two of them then we're going to
[01:25:48.360 --> 01:25:51.240]   battle it out and we'll come up with some compromise that's okay
[01:25:51.240 --> 01:25:55.640]   well now 13 million americans could come along and utterly take over
[01:25:55.640 --> 01:25:58.840]   insurgently take over one of those two institutions
[01:25:58.840 --> 01:26:03.080]   and they used brilliantly the tools now at hand to do so
[01:26:03.080 --> 01:26:07.080]   and and and used everything legally and above board and the way it is and they
[01:26:07.080 --> 01:26:11.320]   use the system the system wasn't rigged uh they managed to use that system
[01:26:11.320 --> 01:26:15.000]   uh to do that and and so the institutions that depended upon this idea of the
[01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.800]   mass are now challenged because you don't have to be
[01:26:17.800 --> 01:26:21.080]   as big as the mass to take over you just got to be smarter about the tools for
[01:26:21.080 --> 01:26:24.920]   now should we be a parliamentary democracy
[01:26:24.920 --> 01:26:28.600]   it is a total we should we should vote based on our principles i know that's
[01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:32.040]   never going to happen but right now we vote based on the person who can
[01:26:32.040 --> 01:26:35.000]   defeat the person we hate something like fifty five percent yeah
[01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.880]   of people who are voting for trump are doing so
[01:26:37.880 --> 01:26:42.280]   because they want to vote against hiller clinton right only 35 percent or
[01:26:42.280 --> 01:26:44.920]   something like that actually want trump to be president
[01:26:44.920 --> 01:26:47.960]   fifty five percent just don't know on hiller clinton to be president likewise
[01:26:47.960 --> 01:26:50.600]   on the other side a lot of people are going to vote democrat that's because
[01:26:50.600 --> 01:26:53.800]   they don't want donald trump to be the election integrity system
[01:26:53.800 --> 01:26:57.640]   no it's a there are three parties on the ballot in all 50 states
[01:26:57.640 --> 01:27:02.440]   yeah and and and there should be four um bernie sanders should have run on
[01:27:02.440 --> 01:27:07.000]   socialist oh please no gary johnson no yes but gary johnson should have
[01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:10.040]   divided the the right vote uh he should have
[01:27:10.040 --> 01:27:13.400]   do uh uh bernie sanders should have divided the left vote and we'd have at
[01:27:13.400 --> 01:27:16.600]   least four there should actually be a dozen or more people on the ballot
[01:27:16.600 --> 01:27:18.840]   in all the problems look how well that's working on great
[01:27:18.840 --> 01:27:24.680]   britain yeah english also michael has a uh prime minister no one elected
[01:27:24.680 --> 01:27:30.600]   and and a head of of labor nobody likes right and a foreign minister
[01:27:30.600 --> 01:27:35.400]   like not hate other countries i like presidential system but it would work
[01:27:35.400 --> 01:27:39.080]   a lot better if people voted according to the candidate that they want
[01:27:39.080 --> 01:27:41.880]   instead of the person who they think could defeat the candidate they don't
[01:27:41.880 --> 01:27:45.240]   want i i have to say and i and maybe i'm a
[01:27:45.240 --> 01:27:48.760]   sick of my head in the sand but i and i said this yesterday too i think that
[01:27:48.760 --> 01:27:53.880]   our founding fathers were very smart i think they created
[01:27:53.880 --> 01:27:58.360]   an amazingly successful uh form of government that has
[01:27:58.360 --> 01:28:01.560]   stood the test of time that there have been times as
[01:28:01.560 --> 01:28:07.480]   uh fragmented and as uh challenging as this many times in our democracy we
[01:28:07.480 --> 01:28:10.840]   don't really remember them because but they have been and we've survived in
[01:28:10.840 --> 01:28:14.680]   each case and i i think well i think we'll survive in this case and i think
[01:28:14.680 --> 01:28:18.200]   it it works pretty darn well it's not perfect of course
[01:28:18.200 --> 01:28:22.040]   but i have faith in it i i have faith in the founding fathers as well but the
[01:28:22.040 --> 01:28:27.480]   founding fathers never envisioned uh party conventions uh they never
[01:28:27.480 --> 01:28:30.200]   envisioned you know george washington specifically said watch out for
[01:28:30.200 --> 01:28:32.600]   political parties you don't want to get involved with these political
[01:28:32.600 --> 01:28:34.920]   so i i think that they i think it's kind of
[01:28:34.920 --> 01:28:38.760]   that the problems are not founding father problems they're they're simply
[01:28:38.760 --> 01:28:43.160]   things that we've invented lately that and i think we'll transcend those i
[01:28:43.160 --> 01:28:45.960]   think we'll transcend those and i think that uh that's when i'm talking
[01:28:45.960 --> 01:28:51.480]   the three uh uh uh balance the but checks and balances the three
[01:28:51.480 --> 01:28:55.480]   branches of government um the the interesting
[01:28:55.480 --> 01:28:57.640]   the electro-college the interesting kind of
[01:28:57.640 --> 01:29:00.520]   non-representative but represent you know the representative as opposed to
[01:29:00.520 --> 01:29:03.800]   truly democratic system i think all of these things i think
[01:29:03.800 --> 01:29:07.400]   are self-healing and i think they'll work i think that we will
[01:29:07.400 --> 01:29:11.800]   do fine but i hope so i hope i'm right i'm a star i have
[01:29:11.800 --> 01:29:16.200]   a optimist hey you know what if we don't we don't look at uh no empire lasts
[01:29:16.200 --> 01:29:19.720]   forever yeah because i think i think the this notion of
[01:29:19.720 --> 01:29:23.000]   institutional challenge this institutional revolution
[01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:28.360]   is profound and and there are institutions
[01:29:28.360 --> 01:29:32.440]   political parties labor unions universities post office
[01:29:32.440 --> 01:29:37.480]   uh you know all kinds of institutions in society that are now challenged
[01:29:37.480 --> 01:29:40.520]   and and look at newspapers right newspapers are trying to
[01:29:40.520 --> 01:29:45.000]   to preserve themselves in some form maybe they maybe they all do need to go and
[01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:48.840]   this one is what they've replaced the libraries we are in we're in exciting
[01:29:48.840 --> 01:29:52.840]   times right and we're in disruptive times um and i think
[01:29:52.840 --> 01:29:56.600]   equal lib i think that's not an unusual and i think equilibrium
[01:29:56.600 --> 01:30:00.360]   eventually is achieved unfortunately that these these inner
[01:30:00.360 --> 01:30:05.000]   regnums are often sad to say a lot of people get hurt
[01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:09.080]   uh a lot of people lose jobs a lot of people lose their not just their
[01:30:09.080 --> 01:30:13.720]   livelihood but their lives um and and that's always that's the nature of
[01:30:13.720 --> 01:30:17.960]   uh kind of the way human society uh progresses
[01:30:17.960 --> 01:30:20.600]   let me say this without please don't get mad at me people i'm making this for
[01:30:20.600 --> 01:30:24.280]   illustration okay okay which is just listen for one second just i'm not
[01:30:24.280 --> 01:30:27.560]   i'm not saying what i'm about to say but if trolls can take over twitter they
[01:30:27.560 --> 01:30:30.760]   can take over the political system well that's an interesting question yeah
[01:30:30.760 --> 01:30:33.800]   that's an interesting question right if you have a political system
[01:30:33.800 --> 01:30:37.560]   and and and Mike the the disagreement i had with you is that yes and one hand
[01:30:37.560 --> 01:30:41.720]   we should have four parties six parties but it doesn't work with it with a
[01:30:41.720 --> 01:30:44.520]   a a congress that is then built around two parties
[01:30:44.520 --> 01:30:47.480]   we do have you know we do have those parties like Bloomberg actually do have
[01:30:47.480 --> 01:30:52.040]   them like Bloomberg has said uh you know why didn't he run because he said
[01:30:52.040 --> 01:30:55.640]   number one i you know i i couldn't get into either party
[01:30:55.640 --> 01:30:59.320]   so then if i run as an independent let's say i win but i have absolutely no
[01:30:59.320 --> 01:31:02.200]   backing from anything nothing's ever gonna happen to congress
[01:31:02.200 --> 01:31:06.040]   um wouldn't be the first time it you know the only reason we have two
[01:31:06.040 --> 01:31:09.880]   parties is because of the money if if you took the money out of politics
[01:31:09.880 --> 01:31:14.200]   there there would be many many parties and and i think our our democracy would
[01:31:14.200 --> 01:31:17.880]   would function a lot better but but i think that we you mentioned like
[01:31:17.880 --> 01:31:21.160]   the trolls could steal an election if they did steal an election and now back to
[01:31:21.160 --> 01:31:24.840]   technology they'd have to steal it from the bots because i think
[01:31:24.840 --> 01:31:28.120]   i think bots are the ones who really are controlling this election in a scary
[01:31:28.120 --> 01:31:30.680]   way that people haven't really come to terms with
[01:31:30.680 --> 01:31:36.120]   um so much of the influence of political discourse online on social media
[01:31:36.120 --> 01:31:41.320]   is actually automated uh astroturf bots that are really
[01:31:41.320 --> 01:31:44.200]   really more influential than people realize wow
[01:31:44.200 --> 01:31:47.080]   wasn't that a plot drive on just just for the record
[01:31:47.080 --> 01:31:50.520]   go ahead stacey go ahead stacey no wasn't that a plot thread on house of cars
[01:31:50.520 --> 01:31:54.920]   or that was controlling search results oh yeah
[01:31:54.920 --> 01:31:59.400]   yeah they tried to go ahead uh jeff just wanted to the record slate says they
[01:31:59.400 --> 01:32:01.000]   have they do have proof that merit of the
[01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:04.440]   microboretic exists that was that was a short lived
[01:32:04.440 --> 01:32:07.240]   that was a quick brief full merit of this re-assured kind of fun
[01:32:07.240 --> 01:32:09.720]   that was like quality of journalism for us right there
[01:32:09.720 --> 01:32:14.600]   so here's the question is anculture a bot or a troll
[01:32:14.600 --> 01:32:17.480]   it's not clear uh so we don't get in trouble for
[01:32:17.480 --> 01:32:22.920]   i know oh no really do you think anculture has any supporters left
[01:32:22.920 --> 01:32:26.760]   you'll find out be surprised i don't care you'd be surprised
[01:32:26.760 --> 01:32:30.840]   google looks to amp up mobile ads new ad initiative builds on companies
[01:32:30.840 --> 01:32:34.600]   effort to speed up delivery of mobile web content we've caught talked about
[01:32:34.600 --> 01:32:39.240]   uh google amp a kind of strip ad nauseam ad nauseam a stripped down version of
[01:32:39.240 --> 01:32:43.320]   the internet that is compatible with all browsers intended for mobile browsing
[01:32:43.320 --> 01:32:46.760]   to speed up sites google has been encouraging
[01:32:46.760 --> 01:32:50.280]   internet publishers to offer both amp and were unamped
[01:32:50.280 --> 01:32:54.520]   sites uh but of course uh encouraged them to do the faster amp sites
[01:32:54.520 --> 01:32:57.640]   um and uh some ad technology was allowed
[01:32:57.640 --> 01:33:02.360]   is our art does it make sense for ads to be part of amp
[01:33:02.360 --> 01:33:05.560]   oh absolutely because the problem is because of the of the priority in which
[01:33:05.560 --> 01:33:09.000]   the content is served on amp you get the the structure of the page which is
[01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:12.440]   not allowed to change so we can't jump around you get the content
[01:33:12.440 --> 01:33:16.840]   the ads will then box out and then the ad will come into that box when it's
[01:33:16.840 --> 01:33:20.520]   good and ready well so what's happening is the ads ain't getting served by the
[01:33:20.520 --> 01:33:25.160]   time you see in the page right uh so this and google's known this in
[01:33:25.160 --> 01:33:28.520]   the beginning this is the the hidden agenda here
[01:33:28.520 --> 01:33:32.440]   is to speed up not just web pages from content perspective and speed them up
[01:33:32.440 --> 01:33:36.440]   from ads ads are what slow us down so much so if your ads aren't seen in the
[01:33:36.440 --> 01:33:38.920]   one hand the average is going to say well fun and i will pay for it it's not
[01:33:38.920 --> 01:33:42.360]   visible but on the other hand they are trying to buy ads and trying to get the
[01:33:42.360 --> 01:33:46.600]   people and so speeding up ads is a critical piece of speed up the web
[01:33:46.600 --> 01:33:50.600]   it's kind of stripping out that ugly ad tech that really is the real problem
[01:33:50.600 --> 01:33:54.440]   frankly yeah there's there's various things about what you do but i but i think
[01:33:54.440 --> 01:33:57.320]   that that this is important and it's going to be good for the advertisers in
[01:33:57.320 --> 01:34:01.000]   the end the we know from content we've known for years the faster the page the
[01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:04.520]   more engagement and traffic you will get mike we lost your audio i don't i see
[01:34:04.520 --> 01:34:10.040]   you talking but are you i see you talking that's my bad my bad i got it muted
[01:34:10.040 --> 01:34:12.920]   um so i you know the other part of this that a lot of people aren't talking
[01:34:12.920 --> 01:34:16.680]   about is that this initiative also includes a landing page what happens
[01:34:16.680 --> 01:34:21.160]   when you click on this fast ad you get a fast page as a result of that which
[01:34:21.160 --> 01:34:25.240]   makes advertising you know greases the wheels of of advertising which i think
[01:34:25.240 --> 01:34:28.840]   is a good thing i don't see what the harm is and like you said leo i think
[01:34:28.840 --> 01:34:33.000]   slow ads bloated ads is a big part of the problem that's driving people to add
[01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:36.040]   blockers which by the way are now banned in china i'm hearing
[01:34:36.040 --> 01:34:40.440]   um and so i think i think it's uh a loyd good i don't see any downside to this
[01:34:40.440 --> 01:34:46.040]   at all good i feel much reassured
[01:34:46.040 --> 01:34:53.160]   um that was the fastest amp i i never i i i you know it
[01:34:53.160 --> 01:34:56.440]   is amp getting traction i see a lot of amp stuff now
[01:34:56.440 --> 01:35:01.960]   i uh no i still think google is not linking to it from enough places i don't
[01:35:01.960 --> 01:35:05.480]   think i think it's from google news and from the carousel
[01:35:05.480 --> 01:35:11.720]   uh and from um a few other places but i don't think i don't i don't think the
[01:35:11.720 --> 01:35:15.640]   traffic is much yet we go through google now
[01:35:15.640 --> 01:35:21.080]   does it go to an amp page good questions dacey you mean like five i have voice
[01:35:21.080 --> 01:35:26.200]   no i no just if i click on like a story from my google now page you'll roll it
[01:35:26.200 --> 01:35:29.080]   out bit by bit uh yeah i see i see amp articles in my
[01:35:29.080 --> 01:35:32.520]   google now it has the has the little lightning bolt not all of them
[01:35:32.520 --> 01:35:35.720]   but yeah not a little bit yeah but i think i do see lightning bolts let me just
[01:35:35.720 --> 01:35:39.240]   check real quickly to make sure but i i seem to remember lightning bolts in my
[01:35:39.240 --> 01:35:43.720]   google in my google now stories i love by the way i love google now i don't
[01:35:43.720 --> 01:35:46.600]   know uh i don't know what google's plans are
[01:35:46.600 --> 01:35:49.640]   they don't get any usage they don't they don't really seem to have a long
[01:35:49.640 --> 01:35:53.560]   term strategy google now should be their strategy
[01:35:53.560 --> 01:35:57.000]   yeah i i mean because it's it's the anticipatory
[01:35:57.000 --> 01:36:03.000]   web right now i agree so i'm like make it happen man i love you use it all the
[01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:06.440]   times dacey i do it i mean i love that it alerts
[01:36:06.440 --> 01:36:11.640]   me when there's traffic stuff if i put in an address i what else do i accuse it
[01:36:11.640 --> 01:36:16.440]   for all kinds of stuff i love it i open it whatever i'm in a place
[01:36:16.440 --> 01:36:21.240]   just to see like what's cool on the menu or i was in the cell phone lot at the
[01:36:21.240 --> 01:36:25.400]   airport and i opened that and it was like hey people who are at this spot
[01:36:25.400 --> 01:36:28.280]   this location they want to see this and it handed me the
[01:36:28.280 --> 01:36:31.400]   arrival times of all the flights coming into the airport and i was like yeah
[01:36:31.400 --> 01:36:33.720]   that's what i was gonna search yeah isn't that awesome
[01:36:33.720 --> 01:36:37.080]   yeah but you know i get kind of that stuff in in
[01:36:37.080 --> 01:36:40.760]   in google inbox which is great i see it showing up in various places in google
[01:36:40.760 --> 01:36:44.520]   keep and and some of the google now stuff i think that google now will really
[01:36:44.520 --> 01:36:47.160]   should come into its own i don't know if it will
[01:36:47.160 --> 01:36:51.880]   when google home comes out because i find personally that once i started
[01:36:51.880 --> 01:36:56.040]   started using the amazon echo and elixir i can i almost completely stopped
[01:36:56.040 --> 01:37:01.080]   using google now and syri mmm hmm no i think google home
[01:37:01.080 --> 01:37:04.680]   um no one knows yet but i would actually like google now on the echo
[01:37:04.680 --> 01:37:08.760]   i know that's like sacrilege blasphemy whatever but i would love it
[01:37:08.760 --> 01:37:12.440]   well i think you're gonna i think that's gonna be what that little uh
[01:37:12.440 --> 01:37:15.880]   air freshener yeah but i don't want to buy the air freshener
[01:37:15.880 --> 01:37:19.160]   i already have a bunch of so yeah it was like me i have like
[01:37:19.160 --> 01:37:22.920]   probably four or five thousand dollars for the sonos equipment
[01:37:22.920 --> 01:37:26.920]   yeah me too oh oh did you guys that was me being excited
[01:37:26.920 --> 01:37:30.040]   that was so exciting yes so this is a
[01:37:30.040 --> 01:37:35.320]   gladiic that i ring don't please i want that ring tone
[01:37:35.320 --> 01:37:40.680]   please this is such a common question i have to tell people about it
[01:37:40.680 --> 01:37:46.840]   so a company called jaystar thank you stacey i love you
[01:37:46.840 --> 01:37:53.320]   okay they showed a video for an echo skill that is not yet approved
[01:37:53.320 --> 01:37:57.240]   that will you control your sonos from your amazon echo so
[01:37:57.240 --> 01:38:00.440]   it's if you google it's a youtube video from
[01:38:00.440 --> 01:38:05.160]   it's the company that does josh ai josh dot so it's not an official uh
[01:38:05.160 --> 01:38:09.640]   interface it's not approved yet they've made the skill but it's not from sonos
[01:38:09.640 --> 01:38:13.000]   it's not from sonos why not because sonos doesn't have their
[01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:20.120]   api put together yet anyway there it is third party app josh
[01:38:20.120 --> 01:38:23.320]   will bring a few new skills and different voices to echo that's
[01:38:23.320 --> 01:38:26.680]   interesting and the sonos thing is kind of at the end so
[01:38:26.680 --> 01:38:32.200]   the first part of josh like an altar like is it in the echo is it in my echo
[01:38:32.200 --> 01:38:38.280]   josh is actually uh home control with voice so it's not in my echo
[01:38:38.280 --> 01:38:41.400]   no it's a skill that they've developed and they're just waiting for approval but
[01:38:41.400 --> 01:38:46.520]   it's an echo skill they've designed it to be but amazon has to approve it
[01:38:46.520 --> 01:38:50.200]   so i'm saying things like ask josh to play
[01:38:50.200 --> 01:38:55.720]   the on say lemonade on my sonos and that's so i can control that
[01:38:55.720 --> 01:38:59.640]   yeah and that's the part of the amazon echo that doesn't work you need we need
[01:38:59.640 --> 01:39:04.280]   artificial intelligence and we need alexa choosing the skill if i have to remember
[01:39:04.280 --> 01:39:08.840]   it's yeah echo yeah sorry the the just say a virtual system that shall
[01:39:08.840 --> 01:39:14.040]   not be named yeah um that should be picking the skill not me i don't
[01:39:14.040 --> 01:39:17.560]   i can't remember all of these commands well you can that yeah agree with you and
[01:39:17.560 --> 01:39:20.440]   that's what google and apple are about to do where they
[01:39:20.440 --> 01:39:24.920]   disintermediate they they be you know they are actually vice versa they
[01:39:24.920 --> 01:39:31.880]   intermediate they become your ombudsman and go out and get what you need
[01:39:31.880 --> 01:39:34.840]   uh and they know what apps you have and they know what skills you need and you
[01:39:34.840 --> 01:39:40.120]   just ask her that's how and well that's how echo should be too right
[01:39:40.120 --> 01:39:45.560]   and viv will be like that too which is right viv.ai
[01:39:45.560 --> 01:39:49.880]   um how i you know it's funny because until you get your tesla that you can't
[01:39:49.880 --> 01:39:53.480]   use the tesla app it says you don't have it yeah wow
[01:39:53.480 --> 01:39:59.560]   oh because i really i know i really want to use it but i so
[01:39:59.560 --> 01:40:03.000]   it's not that great how well integrated is your tesla into
[01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:07.400]   your sonos and everything else is it is it just is it an is it an i it's not
[01:40:07.400 --> 01:40:11.800]   it should be an iot thing right so there is a company it's called
[01:40:11.800 --> 01:40:16.680]   hold on i think it's called eve let me find it they do they do an app through
[01:40:16.680 --> 01:40:21.560]   the wink and the last time i tried it um it was super
[01:40:21.560 --> 01:40:25.560]   high latency so it didn't work as well and then tesla introduced some of the
[01:40:25.560 --> 01:40:30.520]   same functionality that i liked but they have since revamped it
[01:40:30.520 --> 01:40:35.080]   and i haven't tried it yet um i'm looking for it in my inbox which is
[01:40:35.080 --> 01:40:38.520]   exciting um here it is
[01:40:38.520 --> 01:40:43.080]   if connect brings wing oh you found it to tesla that's a karsten he's
[01:40:43.080 --> 01:40:47.960]   fast yes eve connect he's faster than me type he went to harvard you know
[01:40:47.960 --> 01:40:52.200]   oh let's see he won't say it but i will
[01:40:52.200 --> 01:40:57.000]   what's he doing working in a slum like good question
[01:40:57.800 --> 01:41:04.360]   but yes does that and then i think horn sink is gonna sink to the echo
[01:41:04.360 --> 01:41:08.360]   which will give you the smart house oh they announced that it's ces but i
[01:41:08.360 --> 01:41:12.600]   don't know if so you'll pull into the garage and it'll join the wi-fi
[01:41:12.600 --> 01:41:16.920]   well it does that anyway does it the tesla oh yeah no the tesla does yeah but
[01:41:16.920 --> 01:41:22.360]   yes yeah do you do you have autopilot no i do not i bought my tesla used because
[01:41:22.360 --> 01:41:27.160]   i'm like you're smart i would i was gonna go miserly
[01:41:27.160 --> 01:41:30.920]   of a sort it's a pretty good it's a pretty good deal to buy a used tesla
[01:41:30.920 --> 01:41:35.080]   oh yeah well so it's never a good idea to buy a new car buying a new car is the
[01:41:35.080 --> 01:41:39.880]   worst it loses and still loses like 30 percent of its value when you drive off
[01:41:39.880 --> 01:41:46.760]   the lot the teslas don't but but yes um we find out on friday
[01:41:46.760 --> 01:41:50.680]   uh oh your car's already lost value they actually said they couldn't
[01:41:52.200 --> 01:41:57.960]   what i haven't bought it yet well they said they couldn't uh keep the pricing of the
[01:41:57.960 --> 01:42:02.040]   model x they couldn't guarantee it would hold up oh yeah they used to guarantee
[01:42:02.040 --> 01:42:05.160]   that right the resale value and they don't they're not gonna do that so
[01:42:05.160 --> 01:42:08.120]   you know i think they're missing a big opportunity with that app
[01:42:08.120 --> 01:42:11.960]   as somebody who's already got one coming you should be able to use the app
[01:42:11.960 --> 01:42:15.080]   yeah communicate with your tesla and say some of what's going on and yeah
[01:42:15.080 --> 01:42:18.120]   tesla should say all right now they're putting the panel in on the yeah yeah
[01:42:18.120 --> 01:42:23.320]   yeah even if they the lie cool even if they said right now i'm getting sprayed
[01:42:23.320 --> 01:42:28.360]   it would be okay i don't care okay well they they should make that up because the app
[01:42:28.360 --> 01:42:32.280]   honestly leo it's not that great oh i'm gonna tell you it's uh android or i
[01:42:32.280 --> 01:42:37.640]   i phone better this the iphone actually is better because it uh comes up faster i think i'm
[01:42:37.640 --> 01:42:40.600]   going to dedicate my iphone to this it's gonna be like my tesla phone
[01:42:40.600 --> 01:42:45.560]   it is creepy though because you know you can see where people are
[01:42:46.360 --> 01:42:49.240]   there's a location section so you can see the car driving around
[01:42:49.240 --> 01:42:54.040]   and i always i'm like oh man you know my husband will log in and it'll be like
[01:42:54.040 --> 01:42:55.720]   he no longer calls and asks me where i am.
[01:42:55.720 --> 01:42:59.880]   Lisa's not gonna like that you mean i can see where Lisa is right now at any moment
[01:42:59.880 --> 01:43:04.280]   and vice versa if she was driving her tesla and you had access to the app yes
[01:43:04.280 --> 01:43:10.760]   you i don't think you can or ask somebody in the chat rooms because i have not been able to
[01:43:10.760 --> 01:43:20.360]   reporting back i will tell you all uh let's see here nougat is very close i have not gotten it
[01:43:20.360 --> 01:43:27.000]   yet on my nexus have you nexus six uh p but apparently preview five is coming soon at

[01:43:58.440 --> 01:44:05.880]   ridiculous okay so you know you test uh you get well if you press and hold
[01:44:05.880 --> 01:44:11.160]   okay so you have to turn you know get the cartoon in which means you go to about phone
[01:44:11.160 --> 01:44:17.480]   tap the android version number like six times you get a cartoon in but press and hold the
[01:44:17.480 --> 01:44:24.360]   and and you get a small cat emoji underneath it tapping that again reveals a no entry emoji
[01:44:25.240 --> 01:44:31.880]   then swipe down your notification quick settings tap edit find the question mark android Easter
[01:44:31.880 --> 01:44:37.320]   egg quick setting drag it to your quick settings after it's moved tapping on the new empty dish
[01:44:37.320 --> 01:44:43.880]   quick setting toggle begins a game where you have to ticicat to feed from an empty plate using either

[01:44:50.600 --> 01:44:55.640]   which isn't guaranteed you receive a notification with a cat and a number tapping on that reveals
[01:44:55.640 --> 01:45:01.320]   a new window with a smiling cartoon cat that when long pressed can be shared as an image
[01:45:01.320 --> 01:45:11.560]   oh um this is why i carry an iphone what i got oh is that somebody's 20 project what's the deal with
[01:45:11.560 --> 01:45:17.800]   that did they do they tell you this when they release it no no no somebody that's the question
[01:45:17.800 --> 01:45:22.040]   is how does somebody at android central finest annual baiter geez
[01:45:22.040 --> 01:45:24.920]   someone must ascend of an email that's not even
[01:45:24.920 --> 01:45:31.320]   that's not an easter egg yes lake brian uh it was his informant
[01:45:31.320 --> 01:45:39.720]   uh he has 715 followers on google plus he's a computer gaming nerd and apparently has a lot
[01:45:39.720 --> 01:45:47.640]   of free time wow wow here is uh something that worries me hangouts the new version of hangout
[01:45:47.640 --> 01:45:55.000]   does not no longer merges sms messages with hangout messages in other words you really
[01:45:55.000 --> 01:46:01.960]   don't want to use it as your sms client anymore you have to start using that other thing google
[01:46:01.960 --> 01:46:07.560]   messenger this is part of google's inexplicable policy of making almost everything that they offer
[01:46:07.560 --> 01:46:14.120]   work not as good as it used to him what why would you even what the when you get five
[01:46:14.120 --> 01:46:18.760]   me of yeah this reminds me of google photos which used to have amazing editing tools they took it out
[01:46:18.760 --> 01:46:24.120]   and now they're just lousy editing tools so it's like why did you do that and they still on the
[01:46:24.120 --> 01:46:32.760]   code but they said not to use it so mike are you using phy in your travels yes i am and in fact
[01:46:32.760 --> 01:46:39.240]   this is my uh this is my tool of the week oh okay so i can talk about it now i'll save it i'll
[01:46:39.240 --> 01:46:43.160]   say that's coming up say that because i want to know if i should get a five foot for my kid
[01:46:43.160 --> 01:46:52.120]   okay i will tell you excellent yay facebook uh is paying a lot of money to get internet stars
[01:46:52.120 --> 01:46:59.720]   to put their live video on facebook kind of wooing away the vine stars how much they paid you Leo
[01:46:59.720 --> 01:47:05.000]   nothing two point two million dollars in payments intended to encourage experimentation on facebook
[01:47:05.000 --> 01:47:11.240]   live says facebook this isn't even a rumor uh they're they're they're paying they're paying
[01:47:11.240 --> 01:47:19.880]   they're paying a guy john paul pikaz who is a vine star he does body six second videos on vine
[01:47:19.880 --> 01:47:24.360]   a hundred and nineteen thousand dollars to use facebook live streaming at least five times a
[01:47:24.360 --> 01:47:30.360]   month through september nice work if you can get it ray william johnson's getting a quarter of a
[01:47:30.360 --> 01:47:39.560]   million dollars are these all guys yep oh good boy are these are they all doing body humor as it were
[01:47:39.560 --> 01:47:45.400]   probably i don't i mean vine is a good place for that i'm just thinking about like the demographic
[01:47:45.400 --> 01:47:50.920]   they're trying to go after it and that's interesting i didn't think it is there are some great female
[01:47:50.920 --> 01:47:57.480]   vineyards oh yes i'm just i'm just and it could be just the list they selected yeah maybe guys are
[01:47:57.480 --> 01:48:05.240]   more likely to be like yes here you go a least strechen strechen host of the youtube cooking
[01:48:05.240 --> 01:48:11.560]   channel my cupcake addiction says a facebook video may draw a million views in nine hundred
[01:48:11.560 --> 01:48:18.200]   to a thousand comments a live video live video may get only a hundred thousand views but as many
[01:48:18.200 --> 01:48:24.920]   as three thousand comments so she says i don't know what you think about that yeah it's weird
[01:48:24.920 --> 01:48:30.760]   more comments but fewer views when i'm live she says on my youtube show it's polished it's perfect
[01:48:30.760 --> 01:48:35.800]   when i'm live so she is apparently one of these people getting paid this is the wall street journal
[01:48:35.800 --> 01:48:39.800]   when i'm live it's really me like dealing with when your kitty it's half the ingredients and
[01:48:39.800 --> 01:48:45.320]   you have to improvise oh that's probably fun to watch according to the document viewed by the
[01:48:45.320 --> 01:48:52.360]   journal mr. and maybe paid up to a hundred ninety six thousand dollars during five months to create
[01:48:52.360 --> 01:49:00.680]   live videos she declined to comment so here's a question so sure sure pay to play they work hard
[01:49:00.680 --> 01:49:04.920]   they deserve the money i was thinking about the viewership in the commentary because the idea is
[01:49:04.920 --> 01:49:08.760]   the back and forth that you would be getting right which would be awesome right and those
[01:49:08.760 --> 01:49:14.520]   cat is comments right yeah that's what i imagined yeah yeah sorry mike i just wonder if you can transfer
[01:49:14.520 --> 01:49:22.040]   a fan base from one platform to another i mean do are there any known cases where you can simply
[01:49:22.040 --> 01:49:27.480]   buy people who emerged organically on vine or youtube and then transferred them to another service
[01:49:27.480 --> 01:49:32.920]   where they continue to grow and and be part seems to me that certain types of people are
[01:49:32.920 --> 01:49:37.160]   ideally suited for certain platforms and thrive on that platform yeah i mean
[01:49:37.640 --> 01:49:41.960]   vine is very different from youtube for example and facebook's trying to buy
[01:49:41.960 --> 01:49:49.080]   influence in this space is that possible has this ever been done i give you i don't think so i think
[01:49:49.080 --> 01:49:59.720]   that that's actually this is jeff bazos's first vine i'm i'm i kid you not this is jeff bazos's first
[01:49:59.720 --> 01:50:06.200]   vine he's a he's an alien from star trek beyond i guess he's when it comes to signal to noise ratio
[01:50:06.200 --> 01:50:11.160]   he really i think his first i think his first ever tweet was i just launched and landed a rocket
[01:50:11.160 --> 01:50:17.160]   yeah yeah this is from the 20th just a couple of days ago no wait a minute that's today that's today
[01:50:17.160 --> 01:50:22.840]   couple of days ago that's right now uh and i guess i've heard that he's an extra in star trek beyond
[01:50:22.840 --> 01:50:27.560]   he's an alien yeah yeah so this is which is awesome i would totally use my celebrity status as a
[01:50:27.560 --> 01:50:33.160]   seetio to get into like yeah i hope i hope them that he laughs because that would his laugh is so
[01:50:33.160 --> 01:50:38.280]   distinctive is the best that you would immediately know my god that alien's jeff bazos is there a jeff
[01:50:38.280 --> 01:50:44.760]   bazos laugh ringtone there's no there should be along with the stacey higginbotham ringtone
[01:50:44.760 --> 01:50:49.960]   i think i need ringtone that's the stacey higginboth and joy ringtone the joy the ringtone of joy
[01:50:49.960 --> 01:50:56.440]   um anyway i to answer your question i think you're exactly right mike i don't think it translates
[01:50:56.440 --> 01:51:01.480]   and i think that uh we we've already seen we saw youtube try to do this they spent hundred
[01:51:01.480 --> 01:51:05.240]   million dollars taking celebrities from other media to bring them to youtube
[01:51:05.240 --> 01:51:09.640]   um and it didn't didn't work chakilo niel did not become a youtube star
[01:51:09.640 --> 01:51:15.960]   uh as big a star as he is in the real world so there there are youtubers though in viners that go to
[01:51:15.960 --> 01:51:23.160]   like uh the disney channel and other oh friend higgin what was his name? Fred figles?
[01:51:23.160 --> 01:51:30.200]   Fred? Fred was a big youtube star and i don't i don't think you could qualify his film career as
[01:51:30.200 --> 01:51:37.400]   successful i think i think it is really very much uh i don't know of an exception but i think it's
[01:51:37.400 --> 01:51:45.080]   very much oh what about erin um oh she's she's a sports caster lady um was she a bine star?
[01:51:45.080 --> 01:51:48.920]   um you know she was her she had a vlog she had a video uh a youtube thing oh they're quite
[01:51:48.920 --> 01:51:52.520]   if actually come to think of it they're quite a few people have migrated from youtube to mainstream
[01:51:52.520 --> 01:52:00.120]   success that's not okay but youtube's more like real tv than vine is vine is a very specific medium
[01:52:00.120 --> 01:52:06.040]   it is and it's a weird culture because i mean there are huge stars on vine that you and i have
[01:52:06.040 --> 01:52:11.560]   never heard of because we're not yeah viners i love vine do you do you do you go every day will
[01:52:11.560 --> 01:52:17.560]   you go to vine every day and look at no i just like making them you make them i've only made a few
[01:52:17.560 --> 01:52:21.480]   but yeah i i like shooting like tiny little six second videos like when we had this hedgehog
[01:52:21.480 --> 01:52:25.800]   in our house i kept trying to make it do something interesting so i could vine it because i just
[01:52:25.800 --> 01:52:30.520]   thought it'd be fun was it a feral hedgehog or was it a pet hedgehog no it was a pet hedgehog okay
[01:52:30.520 --> 01:52:33.800]   if it were feral it would have been more interesting i would say getting out of the house was the
[01:52:33.800 --> 01:52:38.520]   main thing you should be frustrated on that case yes to me the biggest question that i'm really
[01:52:38.520 --> 01:52:46.600]   curious about is what happens when youtube's mobile live feature kicks in uh will that launch a
[01:52:46.600 --> 01:52:53.720]   bunch of live youtube stars or you know or not is youtube ideally suited for the pewdiepie type
[01:52:53.720 --> 01:53:00.040]   of of edited knowledge videos or can it be a great medium for live i'm really curious i i hope
[01:53:00.040 --> 01:53:07.240]   that it will spawn a whole new generation of youtube live stars but i we don't know i'll bet it will
[01:53:07.240 --> 01:53:13.400]   you know but live is so so so the hot thing now thanks to facebook the ap tv interview today about
[01:53:13.400 --> 01:53:19.400]   the roger ales potentially leaving fox news and the guy who shot it said that uh now all the
[01:53:19.400 --> 01:53:25.240]   clients out there want nothing but live tv it's all it was live yeah good yeah i love that i mean
[01:53:25.240 --> 01:53:31.160]   i'm awesome live is great right that's what we're doing live well we are and we aren't i know i
[01:53:31.160 --> 01:53:37.240]   i mean because the the really the the vast majority of our viewers and listeners consume it uh after
[01:53:37.240 --> 01:53:41.240]   the fact which isn't that isn't that pro you know i haven't seen any numbers isn't that true of facebook
[01:53:41.240 --> 01:53:49.240]   live as well oh maybe yeah it's not true tv yeah i mean on demand is a fraction of the total tv
[01:53:49.240 --> 01:53:56.040]   audience but but that's because tv is but the fact as you know leo the fact that you do have some live
[01:53:56.040 --> 01:54:01.240]   audience and it goes for facebook live and so on completely changes what the content is and how
[01:54:01.240 --> 01:54:07.640]   it feels and all that kind of stuff absolutely absolutely here we go hi dad is you're dead watching
[01:54:08.200 --> 01:54:12.440]   he said he said he would be nice i could only do if he were live where is your is your dad also in
[01:54:12.440 --> 01:54:18.040]   Austin or is he uh no he's in he's in Houston Houston so stay even have pet hedgehogs
[01:54:18.040 --> 01:54:24.200]   you're still worried about the hedgehog yes people do have pet hedgehogs i believe only
[01:54:24.200 --> 01:54:31.160]   you're people do people in texas have pet armadillos i have never oh no i saw my first live armadillo
[01:54:31.160 --> 01:54:38.040]   actually a year ago so um i don't think so maybe i'm not they beloved oh yes but they're like
[01:54:38.280 --> 01:54:43.000]   always dead in the middle of the road did you do you better than other pets to save them oh yeah
[01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:48.040]   you see a lot of armadillos on the road killing uh i think we need to save the armadillos campaign
[01:54:48.040 --> 01:54:52.600]   oh just never been to texas i texas doesn't think that way
[01:54:52.600 --> 01:54:58.360]   if we want to make you kill it i just want you to understand how lucky you are because not only
[01:54:58.360 --> 01:55:04.200]   can you openly carry a gun in texas you can have a hedgehog as a pet here in california we can't do
[01:55:04.200 --> 01:55:11.480]   either i know hedgehogs are illegal they're illegal in new york i think i think new doesn't
[01:55:11.480 --> 01:55:16.120]   new york come class fairs we're we're outlawed for a while they're back i don't know about hedgehogs
[01:55:16.120 --> 01:55:22.360]   ferrets sugar gliders hedgehogs all illegal uh in the state of care and they're in the
[01:55:22.360 --> 01:55:26.600]   people's republic of california my son drives them crazy says why can't i have a hedgehog
[01:55:26.600 --> 01:55:30.520]   okay they're not that great you have to get a license they're not that great they smell a
[01:55:30.520 --> 01:55:34.520]   little bit don't they just think about the amazing things will be legal after the texas
[01:55:34.520 --> 01:55:43.320]   texas i'm voting for texas here's a here's a change.org petition you might want to assign
[01:55:43.320 --> 01:55:50.680]   legalize hedgehogs as pets in the state of california yep they didn't reach the critical number
[01:55:50.680 --> 01:55:59.480]   leo maybe you can change that everybody now i beg of you what's that what's that jeff
[01:55:59.480 --> 01:56:04.920]   so i downloaded the the latest uh nougat and i can't get google now at all
[01:56:04.920 --> 01:56:09.640]   oh that's a tragedy i think google's killing google now let's start a rumor
[01:56:09.640 --> 01:56:13.320]   oh no they're merging it with plus and hang out
[01:56:13.320 --> 01:56:19.960]   changing it to google then google then it's going to be whoever was in charge of google
[01:56:19.960 --> 01:56:21.400]   wave is not going to be in charge of them
[01:56:23.160 --> 01:56:31.480]   uh soft bank buys arm for thirty two billion dollars thereby co-opting cornering
[01:56:31.480 --> 01:56:34.920]   completely owning the entire internet of things market for now and ever
[01:56:34.920 --> 01:56:43.400]   and ever amen right stacy sort of oh what do you think i think this is really crazy
[01:56:43.400 --> 01:56:46.920]   deal i'm glad we're talking about it because well you want i see the note that says stacy
[01:56:46.920 --> 01:56:54.200]   wants to talk about this please um okay so this is a great this is okay this is a surprising thing
[01:56:54.200 --> 01:57:01.400]   yeah uh soft bank they actually have soft bank the carrier in japan they also own sprint um and
[01:57:01.400 --> 01:57:09.320]   i i gotta say that it was so crazy because no one thought arm would go anywhere because
[01:57:09.320 --> 01:57:15.080]   they are like they're so brittish they're very british you can tell looking at simon i mean
[01:57:15.080 --> 01:57:22.760]   look at that guy yes he's stayed um he also said this is a dark day for the british empire
[01:57:22.760 --> 01:57:28.600]   that was the co-founder of that was another co-founder oh it was another guy okay it was it was the
[01:57:28.600 --> 01:57:34.840]   guy who founded it uh not simon that would be terrible if your ceo said that um oh that's right
[01:57:34.840 --> 01:57:41.480]   he's all for it he's yes he did he helped do the deal yeah but he says in that video actually he
[01:57:41.480 --> 01:57:47.320]   says in the video that the only reason they did it is because they paid so darn much for it um
[01:57:47.320 --> 01:57:52.680]   it's a lot of money that's a chunk of change it's the second largest chip deal after a broad
[01:57:52.680 --> 01:58:02.360]   camavago wow so that was 37 billion so this is huge soft bank gets basically 90s 95 most almost
[01:58:02.360 --> 01:58:09.000]   every single mobile phone has an arm based processor inside an arm doesn't sell chips they make the
[01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:13.400]   sell the design they sell an instruction set basically sell the design for the chip
[01:58:13.400 --> 01:58:19.720]   they own the mobile ecosystem they are getting into microprocessors which is the internet of things
[01:58:19.720 --> 01:58:24.520]   but they do actually have competition there um and then they are also getting into servers
[01:58:24.520 --> 01:58:30.920]   so there's they don't screw it up there's like growth potential for them oh i think this is a deal
[01:58:30.920 --> 01:58:37.160]   i know it's a lot of money but i think so and soft bank by the way i i i used to work for a sun
[01:58:37.160 --> 01:58:44.680]   sun because he owns it's davis briefly and i think partly it's hard to understand soft bank
[01:58:44.680 --> 01:58:50.200]   it's it's not it's more like bircher Hathaway than it's like yeah private this isn't a strategic
[01:58:50.200 --> 01:58:55.480]   deal for them this is like we have a lot of money let's put it someplace it's going to grow yeah
[01:58:55.480 --> 01:58:59.640]   and so they're not going to move arm to japan they're going to let the same people run it they're
[01:58:59.640 --> 01:59:04.680]   just they want to own the proceeds i think it's a great deal they're going to own internet of things
[01:59:04.680 --> 01:59:10.360]   they're gonna they're gonna own the future they will yes they could own the future architecture for
[01:59:10.360 --> 01:59:15.640]   like just about everything intel is taken to run an arm and failed in fact arm is basically putting
[01:59:15.640 --> 01:59:21.400]   intel out intel out of business in a way it is and it's encroaching on their territory servers
[01:59:21.400 --> 01:59:26.360]   a margin server territory now whether or not that'll actually happen i don't know they're also both
[01:59:26.360 --> 01:59:33.640]   going after the cellular equipment market with uh that used to have like a six like program like
[01:59:34.200 --> 01:59:40.040]   specially designed chips the cellular equipment market is now arm scott stuff there and so does
[01:59:40.040 --> 01:59:43.960]   intel so that could be interesting too and that's related to some of soft things so
[01:59:43.960 --> 01:59:49.160]   interesting intel um or apple somebody was rumored to be going after arm the problem is because
[01:59:49.160 --> 01:59:56.360]   it could really uh and then and this article on medium that you you linked to did you write it
[01:59:56.360 --> 02:00:00.040]   oh yeah i wrote that one well there you go that would be why you linked to it
[02:00:01.160 --> 02:00:06.440]   i was really just something else no no no this is good you point out that other chip companies really
[02:00:06.440 --> 02:00:11.480]   because of any competitive issues couldn't buy it it had to be somebody like soft bank
[02:00:11.480 --> 02:00:14.440]   yeah and a long time ago i thought google might buy it but then
[02:00:14.440 --> 02:00:21.000]   amazon and all of these other like data sent companies that operate big data centers took arm
[02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:27.000]   licenses so then someone like google couldn't really buy it um i think this is a very exciting
[02:00:27.000 --> 02:00:32.440]   move i i couldn't if they put the money into arm i think it will be amazing yeah
[02:00:32.440 --> 02:00:40.200]   yeah and apple um some question about apple because uh apple uses arm has licensed the arm
[02:00:40.200 --> 02:00:47.160]   architecture to create the iphone and ipad chips um but they have i think they have a perpetual
[02:00:47.160 --> 02:00:52.600]   license to this there's two types of licenses there's an architecture right yeah which means
[02:00:52.600 --> 02:00:56.200]   you can futz with the design as long as you don't that's what apple has right and that's what apple
[02:00:56.200 --> 02:01:01.240]   has um in sam san and qualcom and all those guys and then there's just like the straight up we're
[02:01:01.240 --> 02:01:05.640]   just going to take this as it is and use it like razz great hi as long as you don't want sissy
[02:01:05.640 --> 02:01:11.800]   you can you can't futz with the if you don't have an architectural license you can't futz with it
[02:01:11.800 --> 02:01:16.120]   oh okay i thought i thought you were starting to say something to either buy their design outright
[02:01:16.120 --> 02:01:21.080]   which is cheaper or you buy the right to use the design as a basis for your own designs which
[02:01:21.080 --> 02:01:28.280]   is what apple does right it's kind of like android yeah it well except it's not there's no free tier
[02:01:28.280 --> 02:01:33.640]   no a free arm tier there's no free tier and they make sure there's there are limits to how you
[02:01:33.640 --> 02:01:40.280]   couldn't like fork the arm instructions that oh that's interesting so apple can't uh abandon arm
[02:01:40.280 --> 02:01:45.800]   and just say hey we got it from here they they can't they could totally design their own chips
[02:01:45.800 --> 02:01:52.520]   and then have to start from scratch but they couldn't use the arm right architecture right but they've
[02:01:52.520 --> 02:01:58.200]   done i mean arm came about is apple working with a company called acorn technology all right so
[02:01:58.200 --> 02:02:05.000]   for the newton uh well and acorn did the bbc computer i think so with this is really interesting by the
[02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:09.640]   way it powers something that is in some ways spiritually the success of the bbc computer which
[02:02:09.640 --> 02:02:15.560]   is the razberry pie um and that's also powered by arm and yes then apple put a lot of money to
[02:02:15.560 --> 02:02:21.160]   arm for the newton one of the first mobile devices and then sold its stake in arm but continued to
[02:02:21.160 --> 02:02:28.360]   use arm designs uh well didn't continue to they restarted i guess uh with the iphone and then later
[02:02:28.360 --> 02:02:33.960]   the ipad um the arm is it's such a quintessentially british company like nobody knows about it they
[02:02:33.960 --> 02:02:39.800]   don't talk about it you know you get intel actually brine cuz antichas and like this but previous intel
[02:02:39.800 --> 02:02:45.400]   ceos were all like you know intel inside and they were so out there kind of like jensen is for
[02:02:45.400 --> 02:02:52.680]   invidia um but arms they've never been that way they've just british yeah yeah that's good
[02:02:52.680 --> 02:03:00.600]   this is a dark day for the british empire we shall fight them in the trenches we'll provide them in
[02:03:00.600 --> 02:03:07.880]   the hands um when is is elon's master plan emerged yet he's writing it now he stayed up all night
[02:03:07.880 --> 02:03:15.160]   he pulled it pulled it all night on crack he tweeted uh which may it was probably not true
[02:03:15.160 --> 02:03:20.440]   um what is his master plan going to be it's had must have it must have something to do with his
[02:03:20.440 --> 02:03:28.440]   acquisition of a solar city right i don't know anyways he said he's he's finishing this is uh
[02:03:28.440 --> 02:03:34.600]   uh this morning 737 finishing off the plan while listening to the soundtrack from gatsby
[02:03:35.240 --> 02:03:41.240]   seems appropriate he has a sense of humor he does elon i'm gonna be at the factory at 11 on
[02:03:41.240 --> 02:03:45.880]   friday come by say hi i'd love to get uh love to get your autograph on my new tesla
[02:03:45.880 --> 02:03:54.120]   um wouldn't that be cool to have a big elon take take a long one yeah take a long sharpie
[02:03:54.120 --> 02:04:00.200]   elon must autograph tesla now that would that would increase the value backup i promise never to
[02:04:00.200 --> 02:04:08.200]   sell it elon never i love you man um all right i think we can uh we can any
[02:04:08.200 --> 02:04:17.160]   this blew me away so this morning almost spit out my Cheerios seagate is announced 10 terabyte
[02:04:17.160 --> 02:04:25.560]   hard drives the helium drives starting at four hundred thirty dollars 10 terabytes
[02:04:26.680 --> 02:04:31.320]   we are living in amazing times that was exactly what i said after i picked up the Cheerios
[02:04:31.320 --> 02:04:39.640]   unbuted 10 terabytes yeah and yet people still buy 16 gigabyte smartphones
[02:04:39.640 --> 02:04:45.240]   well that's because they're doing they don't think they sell them for so much more if they're like
[02:04:45.240 --> 02:04:51.560]   32 or 64 and some people don't even offer 64 at those punks okay yeah i have feelings about this
[02:04:52.120 --> 02:04:57.240]   well this is not flash this is a 7200 rpm that's sure spinning drive
[02:04:57.240 --> 02:05:03.480]   heal they call them helium because they're filled with helium not sure why some some
[02:05:03.480 --> 02:05:08.760]   these gyroscope lighter than they probably has something to do with that right yeah
[02:05:08.760 --> 02:05:16.600]   i i can't imagine what the data density is in these drives it's just uh unbelievable um
[02:05:17.480 --> 02:05:25.240]   who i can remember thinking oh by 2020 we won't be using spinning spindle drives will be it'll be
[02:05:25.240 --> 02:05:32.040]   all holographic memory there's no way but but what but no one predicted was the amazing
[02:05:32.040 --> 02:05:38.280]   increases in capacity that first ibm and then its successors were able to come up with
[02:05:38.280 --> 02:05:45.560]   well also i don't think they were able to contemplate maybe are the amount of digital
[02:05:45.560 --> 02:05:49.000]   detreous we'd like to keep yeah that there would be a market for it
[02:05:49.000 --> 02:05:54.280]   and i mean because spinning drives are still so cheap and then you look at like facebook and
[02:05:54.280 --> 02:06:00.120]   their cold storage efforts and i'm just kind of like stunned by the way someone did tweet me
[02:06:00.120 --> 02:06:04.360]   um saying that the reason you don't have pet armadillos is because they carry leprosy
[02:06:04.360 --> 02:06:10.040]   which okay i'll never pet an armadillo you guys uh honest yeah
[02:06:12.040 --> 02:06:17.240]   one of the things i think is interesting about the about the continued existence of physical
[02:06:17.240 --> 02:06:23.800]   spinning hard drives is that it kind of maps to the logic that google was essentially founded on when
[02:06:23.800 --> 02:06:28.520]   google first started building up a sort of their search engine when even when they were still at
[02:06:28.520 --> 02:06:36.520]   stanford when they first moved into uh the wajiske garage and so on their whole mindset was
[02:06:36.520 --> 02:06:42.520]   everybody else was like how do we maximize reliability uh for each unit that's in this big
[02:06:42.520 --> 02:06:47.800]   story you know this big server uh and and google's like we don't care about that we have a we have a
[02:06:47.800 --> 02:06:55.880]   we have software that will gracefully and quickly fail over across multiple semi functional uh
[02:06:55.880 --> 02:07:02.280]   systems um the only thing that matters is how much is it cost how much bang can we get for the buck
[02:07:02.280 --> 02:07:08.360]   period and so they were scraping together in the early days used hard drives that were problematic
[02:07:08.360 --> 02:07:14.440]   and used uh computers and servers and so on and that's kind of been their mentality all along it
[02:07:14.440 --> 02:07:18.520]   really at the at the end of the day when you have these huge you know they have an enterprise
[02:07:18.520 --> 02:07:21.640]   version that's been out for a while but even for you know consumers who would need something like
[02:07:21.640 --> 02:07:26.600]   this it doesn't matter if it's spinning hard drive it doesn't matter what matters is what's the cost
[02:07:26.600 --> 02:07:34.840]   for per terabyte yes in this case it's a cost per unit of compute for their cost per unit of
[02:07:34.840 --> 02:07:41.320]   search for them yeah resiliency has become the key to not just google and its hardware infrastructure
[02:07:41.320 --> 02:07:45.640]   but even things like if you're going to build something in amazon's cloud the assumption is you
[02:07:45.640 --> 02:07:51.400]   build an architecture stuff be it hardware or software for it to go down and fail over somewhere
[02:07:51.400 --> 02:07:59.720]   else because it's so cheap it's so great sorry i get excited by this that wasn't your excited
[02:07:59.720 --> 02:08:06.440]   sound though that well that wasn't as exciting i have to have her o sound was much better yes yeah
[02:08:06.440 --> 02:08:11.320]   that's new devices cute dogs

[02:11:01.240 --> 02:11:06.520]   why don't we start with uh mike elkin who is visiting us from exon povence as he continues his
[02:11:06.520 --> 02:11:11.400]   own provolce digital nomadic lifestyle i'm so jealous i would love to be in the south of france
[02:11:11.400 --> 02:11:18.280]   right now man it is lovely here and i am loving my pick of the week which is google fi now of course
[02:11:18.280 --> 02:11:23.400]   google fi has been around for a while and stacey asked her earlier in the show should she get a google
[02:11:23.400 --> 02:11:30.440]   fi phone for your daughter stacey yes she's right so the the answer is yes of course you should
[02:11:30.440 --> 02:11:36.840]   google fi has been awesome essentially what it is is an mvno which originally started out on two
[02:11:36.840 --> 02:11:42.760]   us carriers now is on three us carriers and the magic of google fi because they because the phones
[02:11:42.760 --> 02:11:48.680]   the nexus phones that it's available on have special antennas that enable them to quickly
[02:11:48.680 --> 02:11:56.200]   switch on the fly between both wi-fi and the three carriers so if you're walking around and you're
[02:11:56.200 --> 02:12:02.040]   it will it will default to the fastest carrier and if you wander into an area where another
[02:12:02.040 --> 02:12:06.280]   carrier is faster it's just switches you over to the other carrier you never even notice it you
[02:12:06.280 --> 02:12:12.680]   just always have reliability and speed it's magic it's wonderful it's also great in in terms of
[02:12:12.680 --> 02:12:16.680]   and again i'm talking about the existing benefits and i'll get to the new benefits in a sec
[02:12:18.600 --> 02:12:26.440]   the pricing plan is so clear and so fair so essentially you pay you pay a certain amount
[02:12:26.440 --> 02:12:32.120]   for the phone itself so just for the account uh so you pay i believe it's 20 bucks a month for
[02:12:32.120 --> 02:12:37.240]   unlimited domestic talk and text and unlimited international texts and then you get a special
[02:12:37.240 --> 02:12:43.720]   rate on international calls if you're abroad and so on and then you pay ten dollars per month for
[02:12:43.720 --> 02:12:49.000]   each gigabyte that you use and if you and if you and if you you have a budget so you say oh i'm
[02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:53.000]   gonna use three gigabytes but then you only use two then they they give you the money back they
[02:12:53.000 --> 02:12:58.360]   give you the ten bucks back and they do it on a uh you know if you use part of that they'll give you
[02:12:58.360 --> 02:13:03.000]   part of the money back so it's like it's for you stacey one reason to give this to a nine-year-old
[02:13:03.000 --> 02:13:09.000]   is it teaches kids the value of a dollar essentially uh because they they can monitor their usage they
[02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:16.600]   they you're paying for what you get and then you if you if you're disciplined and and you gravitate
[02:13:16.600 --> 02:13:22.040]   to Wi-Fi and change your behavior you get money back and it's a great way to see that in action
[02:13:22.040 --> 02:13:27.560]   whereas other carriers normally obfuscate what you're paying for and so on so it's great uh from
[02:13:27.560 --> 02:13:32.600]   that uh perspective the other reason to use google 5 for a nine-year-old is because it's like have
[02:13:32.600 --> 02:13:37.800]   you're like the kid who owns the pool in the summer when it's 101 degrees in austin uh because
[02:13:38.520 --> 02:13:43.080]   your daughter can walk around and be the person who can offer a Wi-Fi hotspot to all her friends
[02:13:43.080 --> 02:13:50.680]   uh or anybody else who's around or can use other devices on that same Wi-Fi so it's very
[02:13:50.680 --> 02:13:55.560]   empowering and freeing to be able to have a Wi-Fi hotspot anywhere you go now what's new about
[02:13:55.560 --> 02:13:59.800]   google phine why i really love it and a lot of people didn't know this but google phine
[02:13:59.800 --> 02:14:06.840]   internationally was was throttled or capped to 256 megabits per second for the
[02:14:08.280 --> 02:14:15.480]   for the carrier so if you're in an area with a super fast uh LTE you were dropped down to g
[02:14:15.480 --> 02:14:21.400]   across the board no matter where you went internationally and this is one of the ways that they
[02:14:21.400 --> 02:14:25.800]   kept their costs cost in line and everybody kind of accepted this it's great to be able to go
[02:14:25.800 --> 02:14:30.760]   anywhere and for the same price and doing nothing special you get international coverage you don't
[02:14:30.760 --> 02:14:34.760]   have to buy a sim card to all the gymnastics you used to have to do but now all of a sudden
[02:14:34.760 --> 02:14:41.160]   google said you know what we're just gonna lift the cap no cap uh your your data is as fast as the
[02:14:41.160 --> 02:14:46.680]   local data will give you and it's like wow so in your areas where the the carrier that they've got
[02:14:46.680 --> 02:14:54.520]   a contract with has LTE speeds you get LTE speeds i mean it's a radical jump from 2g to LTE it's
[02:14:54.520 --> 02:15:00.360]   one at the same ten gig of ten dollars a gigabyte yes where you can burn through those gigabytes a
[02:15:00.360 --> 02:15:05.320]   lot faster now but still it's the same price yeah but just but you know my son uh just came
[02:15:05.320 --> 02:15:10.280]   back from Barcelona my daughter's in in Mexico right now and the the anxiety it's hard to
[02:15:10.280 --> 02:15:16.920]   understate the anxiety that you feel that you might have this thousand dollar bill you have to
[02:15:16.920 --> 02:15:22.440]   really be careful and not with google phy you just it's the same as in the states and it's wonderful
[02:15:22.440 --> 02:15:27.000]   and it's also an underappreciated feature as you can go to the website or go to the use the app
[02:15:27.560 --> 02:15:32.280]   and you can see exactly what's happening how much you've used how much you've spent you can always
[02:15:32.280 --> 02:15:38.520]   just easily one tap and see what's going on with your account you don't have to wait a month and a
[02:15:38.520 --> 02:15:43.640]   half to get the AT&T bill and realize oh my gosh you know i gotta i gotta take out a loan to pay
[02:15:43.640 --> 02:15:48.600]   pay this bill because i've been abroad and i did the wrong thing exactly i i also have AT&T it's a
[02:15:48.600 --> 02:15:53.720]   real problem um google phy is as it got basically i just tell people turn off data roaming because
[02:15:53.720 --> 02:15:58.040]   you don't know what your phone's doing behind exactly even if you turn off data roaming you can
[02:15:58.040 --> 02:16:02.600]   have a lot of problems and one of these days i'm gonna write a column about some of the problems
[02:16:02.600 --> 02:16:07.800]   uh for example we suspended our our accounts when we were abroad we were abroad for like a couple
[02:16:07.800 --> 02:16:12.520]   of months and then we went back to the u.s and you know we were like okay we're back in the u.s turn
[02:16:12.520 --> 02:16:17.880]   everything back on and because we weren't on a Wi-Fi all these apps were updating they had been waiting
[02:16:17.880 --> 02:16:23.320]   to update oh yeah and and we were we kept getting hearing the all night we was during the night not
[02:16:23.320 --> 02:16:27.960]   using the phone we heard these bleep and it this was AT&T texting and saying you just incurred another
[02:16:27.960 --> 02:16:35.080]   fifty dollars so fresh anyway so the other thing that's that's new about google phy is that they
[02:16:35.080 --> 02:16:40.440]   made a deal with the european carrier three which is in lots of countries that it adds 15 countries
[02:16:40.440 --> 02:16:45.800]   to to the total so now google phy works in a hundred and thirty five countries
[02:16:45.800 --> 02:16:51.800]   with full bandwidth in how many of those not all of them all of them all of them all of them all of
[02:16:51.800 --> 02:16:58.280]   them so are using in some hands right now yeah absolutely I typically how I use it is
[02:16:58.280 --> 02:17:06.760]   I use an iPhone right so I what I do is before we leave the the the Wi-Fi connected Airbnb that
[02:17:06.760 --> 02:17:13.080]   we have I just turn on the phone I turn on the tethering feature throw it in my bag or my pocket
[02:17:13.080 --> 02:17:18.600]   and off we go and we just are connected we can receive and make calls we can get texts and emails
[02:17:18.600 --> 02:17:24.120]   we can just function how many gigs you tend to go through in a month then on fire oh I I keep it under
[02:17:24.120 --> 02:17:30.600]   probably 20 gigs a lot of that's really depends on where you know where you are if you have Wi-Fi
[02:17:30.600 --> 02:17:35.320]   readily available or not you know because we're out working we're in at home so I'm 20 bucks a
[02:17:35.320 --> 02:17:40.760]   month on fire it's very very well more than 20 because that's the base but maybe 30 it's not it's
[02:17:40.760 --> 02:17:45.480]   very affordable compared to my other but it seems to me like you would really get a lot out of it
[02:17:45.480 --> 02:17:51.960]   Leo because you have you buy so many phones do you really need to buy a another another data plan
[02:17:51.960 --> 02:17:55.960]   for every last the issue I wish I could use that's really okay so there's two negatives one you can't
[02:17:55.960 --> 02:18:02.520]   get it outside the US and two there that you have to have a nexus phone either a 6 6 p or 5x well
[02:18:02.520 --> 02:18:07.640]   but that's what I'm saying if you just had a nexus phone connected to Google Fi and then you had
[02:18:07.640 --> 02:18:12.920]   all your other phones connected that's exactly what I do Wi-Fi hotspot yeah so you exactly what I do
[02:18:12.920 --> 02:18:20.760]   yeah and I use Google voice slash fi to forward calls to those other phones yeah yeah that's exactly
[02:18:20.760 --> 02:18:25.720]   and and if you do if you if you are going to get an android phone and you do have Google Voice
[02:18:25.720 --> 02:18:30.120]   one of the options when you sign up is like yeah just make my make that phone's phone number my
[02:18:30.120 --> 02:18:35.960]   Google voice phone number right that's kind of cool it's a really good deal I have to say
[02:18:35.960 --> 02:18:41.400]   I've been very happy and I'm going to be traveling in September to 10 different countries
[02:18:42.120 --> 02:18:47.640]   and it's going to be such a boon to me I was bringing all the phone because T-Mobile course does that
[02:18:47.640 --> 02:18:52.440]   limited data stuff and it also has to be said that you can just open up the app and say okay
[02:18:52.440 --> 02:18:58.040]   suspend it so even if you traveled one month out of the year right you would only pay for that
[02:18:58.040 --> 02:19:03.880]   month that you're traveling right yeah yeah so you can have it just for both you could suspend
[02:19:03.880 --> 02:19:08.840]   the phone and data service you can suspend the data service the phone you got it you got a paper
[02:19:08.840 --> 02:19:13.640]   you're going to get the 20 bucks a month no matter what I so wish I so so wish for a five my five
[02:19:13.640 --> 02:19:18.280]   yeah when are they going to do that when are they going to open to other phones
[02:19:18.280 --> 02:19:23.400]   do you think carriers would be miffed at that though yeah that's why and I think there's
[02:19:23.400 --> 02:19:27.240]   I think you have to have some specialized radios in there to do you do you must have
[02:19:27.240 --> 02:19:33.240]   be able to switch around a tip for you Mike signal spy great app that will let you know what carrier
[02:19:33.240 --> 02:19:39.480]   you're on at any given time I'm on it including one if you had the right if you had the problem yet
[02:19:39.480 --> 02:19:45.240]   Mike where it tries to connect one carrier and Canton doesn't take you at all yes I had that
[02:19:45.240 --> 02:19:51.080]   problem at first in Mexico and I was going back and forth between you pick the carrier and also I'd
[02:19:51.080 --> 02:19:55.080]   go back and okay I'm going to try each one serially and I struggled for a while but eventually just
[02:19:55.080 --> 02:20:02.280]   worked for some reason and I don't know why but so my son is texting me now he's also a Google Fi
[02:20:02.840 --> 02:20:07.160]   user and he says you can suspend both the phone and the it's the whole account oh wow
[02:20:07.160 --> 02:20:11.160]   and that would be really useful then so that makes using a longer than I was for Jeff somebody
[02:20:11.160 --> 02:20:15.400]   travels all the time that would be such a useful thing because you could have no like your travel
[02:20:15.400 --> 02:20:21.800]   phone yeah not no it's worse though for you because at least Mike settles yes your places for one day
[02:20:21.800 --> 02:20:25.720]   there one day here one day there yeah but but but I'm not paying a hundred dollars a lot of
[02:20:25.720 --> 02:20:31.800]   great d&t yeah like me too and it's like I don't even use it but I'm ground-fathered in so they got
[02:20:31.800 --> 02:20:37.960]   me by the you know what and and so I can't I can't leave AT&T not with the unlimited ground-fathered
[02:20:37.960 --> 02:20:42.920]   account so well but I also pay for like a hundred dollars a month just for the foreign stuff and I
[02:20:42.920 --> 02:20:47.240]   wanted to use Fi for a while to make sure I'm secure and then I can pull my international AT&T
[02:20:47.240 --> 02:20:54.200]   not to zero because I still use that phone not one again but way down yeah but this new lifting of
[02:20:54.200 --> 02:20:59.480]   the of the data speed cap is going to be huge big deal for you I think but I think Stacy was
[02:20:59.480 --> 02:21:05.800]   asking a different question I would guess should a nine-year-old have a smartphone so it's actually I
[02:21:05.800 --> 02:21:12.200]   don't want it to be as we need a we don't have a landline in our house so she has a phone but she
[02:21:12.200 --> 02:21:19.240]   has to have a phone so I'm looking for a cheap phone I mean she has she has my old galaxy three
[02:21:19.240 --> 02:21:24.680]   four I don't know which one it is oh so she does have a smartphone it's connected to Wi-Fi but like
[02:21:24.680 --> 02:21:32.120]   making phone calls on that phone is can her a 6p or a 5x yeah so that's yeah she uses the phone
[02:21:32.120 --> 02:21:37.800]   less for internet she has got a computer with internet access it's the cheapest record video
[02:21:37.800 --> 02:21:41.720]   it's the cheapest phone I've ever had the other one that's actually I should maybe a little cheaper
[02:21:41.720 --> 02:21:47.960]   if you never leave the country is Ting was a sponsor for a long time and Ting is yeah yeah
[02:21:47.960 --> 02:21:53.480]   there you go from two counts yeah he's great and so the thing about Ting is you just pay as you go
[02:21:53.480 --> 02:22:00.600]   and and and it really I you know we gave our father-in-law Lisa's old iPhone on Ting and I pay it it's
[02:22:00.600 --> 02:22:06.120]   like nine bucks a month it's nothing because you know if you don't you if you don't use a lot
[02:22:06.120 --> 02:22:11.160]   you just pay for what you use but I think Fyze. Fy Google has really
[02:22:11.160 --> 02:22:19.640]   reinvented smartphones and presumably the new Nexus is somebody told me it's not Nexi it's Nexus
[02:22:19.640 --> 02:22:27.480]   I know she says a joke pico. The Sonos is our Sonos is well it has to do with the noun the Latin
[02:22:27.480 --> 02:22:33.960]   noun if it's a I can't remember the so the CEO of Sonos John is a John McPherly he says it's so
[02:22:33.960 --> 02:22:38.600]   I know he says it's Sonos is and I was like how did you get to that he's like we just asked everybody
[02:22:38.600 --> 02:22:45.000]   that's that was the good said I was like the joke is but Nexus is an actual Latin word and it's
[02:22:45.000 --> 02:22:49.880]   what it what is it Carsten there's some term for us not intransitive but it's a Carsten
[02:22:49.880 --> 02:22:56.440]   Neil Guy asked you went to Harvard tell us I went to a somewhat less good school so I don't know
[02:22:56.440 --> 02:23:04.680]   yeah oh man but in any event somebody sent me an email saying well as a matter of fact Nexus is
[02:23:04.680 --> 02:23:11.720]   is a I got the same one gerundative or whatever and the plural is Nexus
[02:23:13.160 --> 02:23:19.480]   oh like data yeah like no datum data well that that's normal that's a that's a masculine
[02:23:19.480 --> 02:23:27.480]   a noun datum data but and there's data anyway never mind who says the internet is stupid who says
[02:23:27.480 --> 02:23:33.720]   Nexus is a Latin word is the other question of course if we're saying Nexi we're saying it's a Latin
[02:23:33.720 --> 02:23:41.560]   noun that is plural next side but that's not telling a joke what's next we can't say we go on
[02:23:41.560 --> 02:23:47.880]   come on we've got numbers is something else happening uh number no let's do stay let's do
[02:23:47.880 --> 02:23:53.880]   Stacy and then we'll do the number okay mine's really short good because thank you for moving us
[02:23:53.880 --> 02:24:01.800]   along by the way I'm getting hungry I'm like she's getting angry um this is not a new book but
[02:24:01.800 --> 02:24:06.040]   if you haven't read it you can pick it up while you're traveling it's called the cartel and it is
[02:24:06.040 --> 02:24:13.320]   awesome I saw the Netflix movie of the name is it the same thing um I don't know was narco's made
[02:24:13.320 --> 02:24:17.640]   or yeah are you talking about narco's no there's one also called there's a movie called the cartel I
[02:24:17.640 --> 02:24:23.240]   think well my god it might become a movie soon you guys you should read it before that um it's
[02:24:23.240 --> 02:24:29.560]   it's about drug cartels right it's drug cartels in Mexico it's well written it's great um my we
[02:24:29.560 --> 02:24:35.560]   actually read a lot about actual drug cartels and this hues very closely to how they you live
[02:24:35.560 --> 02:24:40.840]   where you live there there's probably a tunnel under your house there there is don't tell anyone
[02:24:40.840 --> 02:24:48.920]   crap now we've got a move he could build a wall but there's always a tunnel so anyway it's a really
[02:24:48.920 --> 02:24:54.200]   good read if you're into that and my Kindle ran out of batteries and I had a buy a book and that
[02:24:54.200 --> 02:24:58.360]   was the book I bought and it's good yeah there isn't a movie yet so you're right uh I get a
[02:24:58.360 --> 02:25:04.200]   re-chimp I like that yeah I you know what Stacy you want to recommend a book every week I
[02:25:04.760 --> 02:25:09.400]   will always recommend books but I love that I would love that Jeff you're number
[02:25:09.400 --> 02:25:15.160]   so I love this the Wall Street Journal went and looked at and they got evidently helped from
[02:25:15.160 --> 02:25:19.960]   Facebook on this getting data for correlations Google usually likes to do this but now Facebook
[02:25:19.960 --> 02:25:26.520]   is those who like Clinton or Trump what they like in various categories of culture so Clinton
[02:25:26.520 --> 02:25:32.840]   Likers and by state but Clinton Likers on music and bands primarily love Adele
[02:25:32.840 --> 02:25:38.680]   Trump Likers primarily like Ted Nugent and George Strait

[02:28:54.120 --> 02:29:02.760]   that is so endearing all right well it is endearing is a good word for it I only have a
[02:29:02.760 --> 02:29:15.400]   minute or two oh oh it is the show title oh oh oh sorry the minute we finished the show last week
[02:29:16.760 --> 02:29:21.720]   Google pushed out the play store for the Chromebook pixel you have to put so now it's two different
[02:29:21.720 --> 02:29:26.120]   Chromebooks or three the first three that they mentioned you have to put it in develop your
[02:29:26.120 --> 02:29:31.400]   in developer mode so not no not developer mode it's like you have to be in the developer track
[02:29:31.400 --> 02:29:36.440]   it's different from the developer mode but it's a setting in your settings and then you will be
[02:29:36.440 --> 02:29:43.160]   offered the here it is this is the android store right there front and center and at this point
[02:29:43.160 --> 02:29:47.480]   they're not restricting it so you can download incompatible apps to your little heart's content
[02:29:47.480 --> 02:29:55.160]   but one of the apps that so most of the apps obviously are not optimized but Google makes
[02:29:55.160 --> 02:30:02.840]   snap-seat it is optimized for the Chromebook finally a powerful wow oh unfortunately snap-seat
[02:30:02.840 --> 02:30:09.800]   is now it is a little buggy and in fact what I found was that it's possible to put on here apps
[02:30:09.800 --> 02:30:17.000]   that slow your pixel down to a crawl so it's you know it's early beta but I have I remember Leo
[02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:22.440]   wouldn't work with my apps account well that might be but you see I have this is telegram messenger
[02:30:22.440 --> 02:30:27.640]   and it it is you know it's written in such a way that it scales I also have Facebook messenger I
[02:30:27.640 --> 02:30:35.160]   have hip chat on here because we use that all the time so these are these are android apps that are
[02:30:35.960 --> 02:30:43.800]   running on Chrome OS natively and it works you know for the most part pretty well known as one of
[02:30:43.800 --> 02:30:49.560]   the changes down here in the toolbar when it's a when when whatever is down here is a chrome
[02:30:49.560 --> 02:30:55.960]   extension it has a little chrome icon on it so you can kind of tell which is an app like here's
[02:30:55.960 --> 02:31:02.200]   the chrome store that's an app it's going to launch chrome and this is not and it's so in fact
[02:31:02.920 --> 02:31:07.480]   in some ways the chrome extensions are second-class citizens on the new yeah isn't that weird
[02:31:07.480 --> 02:31:12.040]   yeah chrome apps are the ones that have to be identified as being different yeah so you see
[02:31:12.040 --> 02:31:17.320]   they're the ones with the little lower icons here but I've tried a number of them this is really
[02:31:17.320 --> 02:31:25.560]   exciting it is it is it's an interesting thing I don't I don't know by the way Pokemon go because
[02:31:25.560 --> 02:31:34.920]   there's no GPS doesn't run alas on the Chromebook pixel although if you had LTE it would so
[02:31:34.920 --> 02:31:40.760]   you know maybe you just need LTE anyway this is this is exciting we're getting close Google says
[02:31:40.760 --> 02:31:46.680]   it will be on almost all new Chromebooks and many older Chromebooks sometime in the next couple of
[02:31:46.680 --> 02:31:55.560]   months android for Chrome OS is now out for the pixel as well wow wow Mike Algens and ex
