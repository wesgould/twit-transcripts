[00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.760]   You can't get that on Amazon I love to copy on your desk.
[00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:17.320]   I know you did I was so sweet I just I came as you were as you were crying in pain.
[00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.600]   Yeah the book fairy left me something while I was getting tattooed.
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:22.600]   Yes.
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:28.520]   Nice to have you and as you know Gina has left the building she'll be back every month
[00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:34.960]   but right now we've got a great person replacing her Matthew Ingram is here from Giga.
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.600]   I'm always great to have Matthew on the show.
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:37.600]   Hi Matthew.
[00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:38.600]   How you doing?
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:45.800]   Nice to have you your Canadian fellas up there Blackberries near is Waterloo near you.
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.680]   It's a couple hours away.
[00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:48.920]   You're in Ottawa right?
[00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:49.920]   I'm in Toronto.
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.000]   Toronto okay for somebody that thought Waterloo was near Toronto.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.760]   Is it kind of is it a backwater?
[00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:02.160]   I'm sure I'm sure they wouldn't like to think of it that way.
[00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.360]   It's a smallish town in a sort of rural area.
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.480]   Isn't it funny that Blackberry is there?
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.960]   Yeah well they came out of the University of Waterloo.
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.240]   Oh that's why that's right.
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.240]   Yeah that's right.
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.000]   Well they may not be there much longer.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:22.080]   Yeah a lot of Reuters reported that Blackberry was in play that Samsung had made an offer
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:31.480]   of as much as seven and a half billion dollars and immediately Blackberry stock jumped 30%
[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:34.080]   closing at $12.59 on the day.
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:35.160]   You can see that's that spike.
[00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.160]   That's this is the one day graph.
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.160]   Yeah boom.
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.200]   Yeah if I drop off it's because I'm selling some shorts that I had.
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:47.280]   Do not short Blackberry at this point.
[00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.680]   But this is not the first time we've heard this rumor effect.
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.680]   This rumor has been floating around for years literally.
[00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.120]   You know it makes a certain amount of sense.
[00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.640]   I mean that's why it keeps coming up.
[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.120]   It would make a certain amount of sense for Samsung.
[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.520]   Blackberry has patents that have value.
[00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:06.760]   Q and X theoretically has value.
[00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.760]   You know the question is what that value is.
[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.720]   And seven and a half billion I don't know seems steep to me.
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:20.280]   Business Insider says the patents alone are only two to three billion.
[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.440]   And we kind of know this because there was some thinking about chopping up Blackberry
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.920]   and selling off the parts.
[00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.200]   So we kind of know what's the rest.
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.920]   What's the other like five billion.
[00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:35.040]   I have to wonder you know Q and X was a big part of CES.
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.000]   Ford has announced they're going to use Q and X in the new Ford Sync.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.160]   And Microsoft's car operating system.
[00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.240]   Q and X is actually very highly regarded real time operating system and Blackberry owns
[00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:48.240]   it.
[00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:49.240]   Yeah.
[00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.680]   And until that has value but is it five billion?
[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:52.680]   I do still.
[00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:53.680]   Five billion.
[00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:54.680]   I don't know.
[00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.040]   You know Matthew my I you know how I love Canada.
[00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.360]   You know how I'm a Canadian file.
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.640]   You know how I wanted to move to Canada.
[00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:05.720]   But between Rob Ford and Blackberry and whatever else have been going on lately.
[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:07.960]   What's going on with Canada man?
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:08.960]   What do you mean?
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:09.960]   Come on.
[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.440]   I have to go wrong with Canada.
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.560]   Things are the same you know Rob we took care of Rob Ford so I had a lot of problems
[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.560]   anymore.
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.280]   Is he not the mayor of Toronto anymore?
[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:20.280]   No.
[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:21.280]   No.
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.280]   Just as a counselor.
[00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:24.000]   He's back at the Zick counselor again.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.280]   But yeah I know we just have a regular old boring guy now so.
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:34.520]   Well and you know Matthew I've heard his point you didn't even apologize.
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:39.440]   Well yeah I should say I'm sorry.
[00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:40.920]   What's happening to Canada?
[00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:42.080]   What is happening?
[00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:43.800]   I ask you.
[00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.040]   Nothing has happened to Canada.
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:46.040]   What are you talking about?
[00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:50.920]   Yeah I think you know we're still doing the same old stuff and in fact I would argue with
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:54.480]   the whole lumber sexual trend we're going to be on top pretty soon.
[00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:58.160]   That pretty much photos of that still click an alien.
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.240]   It's not just hockey night in Canada.
[00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.920]   It's hockey night all over the world.
[00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:06.280]   You know lumberjack jackets and boots.
[00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:07.280]   You invented that look.
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:08.440]   Yeah we invented that.
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:09.960]   Not you personally Matthew.
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:10.960]   Not me personally.
[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.720]   Anyway we'll watch that story.
[00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:19.480]   It just broke a few minutes before the show began and I'm not sure exactly whether it's
[00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:20.480]   creditable or not.
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:27.200]   Although the fact that the stock market clearly believes it maybe gives it some lends it some
[00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:33.240]   credibility.
[00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:39.240]   We talked a little bit about this on Windows weekly Google and Microsoft continue to bicker.
[00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:45.960]   Now for the second week in a row Google's security forces have revealed a flaw in Microsoft
[00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:50.440]   Windows saying Microsoft had 90 days to fix it and did not so we're going to tell you
[00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:52.400]   about it.
[00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:58.320]   Microsoft's response is effectively come on man come on.
[00:06:58.320 --> 00:07:01.320]   They did they did issue an out of cycle patch.
[00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:06.800]   And then in related news they say where the scruggled site is down.
[00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:13.200]   It doesn't it points to a different site now to a site called why Microsoft.
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:17.920]   So if you go to scruggled.com you get why Microsoft.
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:22.320]   I think it's a it's a that's probably not an auspicious name for a site.
[00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:23.320]   Why Microsoft.
[00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:24.320]   No it's not.
[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:26.120]   Why Microsoft.
[00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:30.160]   But but it ain't but it ain't scruggled.
[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:36.400]   In fact of late under Satya Nadella Microsoft has been kinder to Android and iOS than it
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:42.640]   has been to its own Windows phone users offering a touch first version of office for instance
[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:48.960]   first on the iPad and now it's coming to Android still not on Windows phone or Windows for
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:51.360]   that matter.
[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:57.080]   So maybe it's just maybe it's an unrequited love.
[00:07:57.080 --> 00:08:03.920]   You know the vulnerability thing I know there's a whole sort of etiquette around how you release
[00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:08.160]   information like that but I have to go with Google on this one I think they that's a public
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:12.600]   service I mean if they if Microsoft had time to do something or to say something that
[00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:14.600]   they should have.
[00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:21.120]   I you know I we I know this is the case that in the security community if you discover
[00:08:21.120 --> 00:08:27.320]   a flaw the the thing to do the done thing is to tell the company that makes a software
[00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:33.320]   and give them an opportunity to patch that Google did that I think maybe the the only
[00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:38.840]   question is well then how much longer do you wait before you disclose it does anybody
[00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:42.920]   think you should never disclose it like well even if Microsoft doesn't didn't fix it Google
[00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:46.400]   should never tell anybody I think everybody agrees that at some point hackers are going
[00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:52.280]   to find it so it is incumbent on the security from the discovers the flaw if the company
[00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:56.760]   doesn't fix it to report it right or not.
[00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:00.280]   What's the average open window Lee I mean ask you this but but isn't there a window open
[00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:05.320]   then between the time Microsoft does act is Google as Google made Microsoft users more
[00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:06.320]   vulnerable.
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:11.880]   Yeah or is the argument that well Microsoft didn't do anything there were better off.
[00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:14.080]   What should have been.
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:17.840]   In fact someone in the chat room mentions that it was fixed a couple of days later.
[00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:24.000]   Well it was and that's fine so for a couple of days it was an exploit.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:29.400]   So Microsoft wrote in the person of Chris Betts Betts who's a senior director of their security
[00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:31.200]   response center.
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:34.480]   He posted although following through keeps to Google's announced timeline Google did
[00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:39.720]   just say as always said you get 90 days keeps to Google's announced timeline for disclosure
[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:45.880]   the decision feels less like principles and more like a gotcha with customers the ones
[00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:49.280]   who may suffer as a result.
[00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:52.920]   What's right for Google is not always right for customers we urge Google to make protection
[00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:58.480]   of customers our collective primary goal Google says the public has a right to know about
[00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:03.280]   these flaws and if a company doesn't fix it.
[00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:07.920]   Yeah and I think if you don't have a timeline then Microsoft can just say yeah we're going
[00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:10.320]   to get around to that we're working on it.
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:15.280]   Please don't say anything right and then it's still a problem and nobody knows about it.
[00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:19.840]   This has been going on for years and I think I think that this wouldn't be such a big deal
[00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:23.680]   if it weren't Google and Microsoft because there's such obvious rivals.
[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:27.600]   But I remember talking to Matthew Conover who was a security researcher this was on the
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:31.960]   screen savers so that means this is more than 10 years ago.
[00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:37.520]   He was one of many researchers at a company called woo woo security and they had found
[00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:42.480]   a serious flaw in Microsoft Windows and he was I right he says it's been over a year
[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:46.600]   we've had many flaws in Windows and it's been over a year Microsoft has done nothing about
[00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:48.240]   it.
[00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:54.960]   So in absence of this threat of disclosure Microsoft may very well sit on its hands.
[00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:59.920]   Yeah it's really something you give the company notice you have a time limit that's the same
[00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:05.600]   for everybody you know like if you make an exception for Microsoft give them a little
[00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:08.400]   longer that you have to do that for everyone.
[00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:16.920]   Betz writes we are in favor of something called coordinated vulnerability disclosure and this
[00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:22.300]   as far as I can tell is Microsoft's idea although other software vendors apparently
[00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:25.280]   have agreed to it.
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:29.040]   Under the principle of coordinated vulnerability disclosure finders disclose newly discovered
[00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:35.560]   vulnerabilities and hardware software and services directly to the vendors or to a national
[00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:39.400]   cert computer emergency response team or other coordinator who will report to the vendor
[00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:44.440]   privately or to a private service that will likewise report to the vendor privately.
[00:11:44.440 --> 00:11:49.400]   The finder allows the vendor the opportunity to diagnose and offer fully tested updates.
[00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:55.680]   The vendor continues before any party discloses vulnerability or exploit information the public.
[00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:58.960]   The venue's vendor continues to coordinate with a finder throughout the vulnerability
[00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:04.280]   investigation upon release of an update the vendor may recognize the finder and boltons
[00:12:04.280 --> 00:12:07.840]   if her tax or underway in the wild and the vendor is still working on the update then
[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:12.360]   both the finder and the vendor work together as closely as possible to provide early public
[00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:16.920]   vulnerability disclosure to protect customers in other words if it's a zero day.
[00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:23.560]   But what they don't mention in this CVD policy and it's again a Microsoft policy is a time
[00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:26.480]   frame.
[00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:29.360]   The assumption is that Microsoft is going to work to patch it or any company is going
[00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:33.280]   to work to patch it but what if they don't?
[00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:40.520]   I guess the argument one argument that I read was that Google could have well basically
[00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:47.440]   that releasing the code like effectively telling people how to use this exploit doesn't help
[00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:53.480]   anyone but bad people it doesn't help users because there's no patch and so they can't
[00:12:53.480 --> 00:13:00.280]   fix it so effectively it only helps the bad guys.
[00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:06.440]   Right and okay I'm going to play devil's advocate here because I don't I guess the question
[00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:12.640]   really is how long is do you wait do you wait a year do you wait ten years because as the
[00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:16.720]   clock ticks there's an increased likelihood that a bad guy will discover this independently
[00:13:16.720 --> 00:13:20.160]   right and then we've got a problem.
[00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:24.960]   The only real argument is Google could have just said there's an exploiter of vulnerability
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:27.640]   they didn't have to release the entire.
[00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:30.840]   Maybe that's the way to do it kind of stage the announcement eventually you have to have
[00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:31.840]   a proof of concept.
[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:34.640]   No they would have gotten they would have gotten crap for that of saying okay now you
[00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:39.120]   know something right and now you're letting everybody know there's something there now
[00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:42.560]   I don't think they could have done that they would have gotten more crap.
[00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:46.680]   Yeah they're going to get crap no matter what.
[00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:51.280]   Well there's additional crap or maybe we should say let's change the metaphor egg on
[00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:55.840]   Google's face because and you guys talked about it last night and all about Android Jason
[00:13:55.840 --> 00:14:02.960]   Hell there's a serious flaw in all versions of Android prior to KitKat that that Google
[00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:07.200]   and this is an interesting you got to choose your words carefully some say won't others
[00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:10.160]   say can't I would say can't fix.
[00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:17.240]   Oh I didn't hear that distinction it has a new web view in the old Android browser.
[00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:21.560]   So remember in the early days of Android instead of getting Chrome on an Nexus device
[00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:25.920]   you'd get that blue icon that was you know the it said the Internet I think.
[00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:28.280]   Yeah it was just Android browser.
[00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:32.480]   Yeah the thing is that WebView is built in throughout the operating system so any application
[00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:36.680]   that displays a WebView many applications do for login purposes of worth is using that
[00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:44.480]   WebView so it's not a simple component to patch but it's a very severe flaw.
[00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:49.760]   So what that means is billions of Android phone users are vulnerable to I think it's
[00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:56.480]   a cross site scripting hack and Google I okay I'm going to say here's my why I say
[00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:58.600]   can't patch it.
[00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:02.760]   All Google can do remember Google makes Android but they don't control who uses it all Google
[00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:08.840]   can do is tell the manufacturers the LG's and HTC's and Samsung's of the world hey you
[00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:14.120]   need to here's the patch which they've done you need to push this out it's not Google
[00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:19.440]   can't has no physical means of pushing it out Samsung has to push it out.
[00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:21.240]   Google did do a patch.
[00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:24.800]   Well and this is the other yes there is a patch Google did not do it third party did
[00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:30.200]   it it's my understanding but it's an open source project that's not unusual some so the open
[00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:35.880]   source project has a patch but the problem is fixing this requires not just and by the
[00:15:35.880 --> 00:15:40.160]   way and the other thing Google did which is a point in their favor they changed this system
[00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:46.860]   so in KitKat and later they can push a patch out through the app store through the play
[00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:53.560]   service is right services so they can fix it now but prior to KitKat there was no mechanism
[00:15:53.560 --> 00:15:59.320]   for them to push this out so that all they can do is say to the otherwise.
[00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:02.880]   Androids in a position of weakness versus a you know.
[00:16:02.880 --> 00:16:07.440]   That's just a control like iOS.
[00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:08.440]   Yeah.
[00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:12.120]   It's just the way Android is an open source project which Google funded and support bought
[00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:16.720]   funded and supports and as kind I mean there's debate about how open it is because if you're
[00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:21.000]   going to use a OSP and you want Google services you have to have the Google store and blah
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.840]   blah blah but Google apps and then Google has to approve your implementation but that
[00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:30.520]   doesn't give Google the ability to go into a Samsung phone running gingerbread and fix
[00:16:30.520 --> 00:16:33.760]   it they don't have any way to do that they have to go to Samsung and then by the way Samsung
[00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:35.760]   probably has to go to the carriers.
[00:16:35.760 --> 00:16:40.720]   Right exactly there's so many layers of you know barriers in front of them.
[00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:46.440]   Not to mention the platform numbers for Android that just came out basically say that the
[00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:52.840]   versions that are affected here are more than 60% of all devices worldwide so the fact that
[00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:57.280]   Google doesn't have their hands specifically in it to address it themselves and they're
[00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:02.040]   leaving it in the hands of researchers to discover and then you know independent third
[00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:07.400]   party developers to code around it and then roll those changes in the AOSP and then does
[00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:12.000]   that get pushed out to all those two plus year old devices probably not.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.240]   It's available to the manufacturers but it's up to the manufacturers to fix it.
[00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:19.480]   And I mean you know our manufacturer is ever rushing to update to your devices.
[00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:20.480]   They want you to buy a new phone.
[00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:22.000]   Exactly how they're going to do that.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.800]   Same with the carriers.
[00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:26.880]   60% of Android devices are vulnerable.
[00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:28.680]   They run jelly bean or lower.
[00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:34.200]   If you're running 4.4 or later you're fine because Google changed this and they update
[00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:35.200]   through play services.
[00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:37.480]   You've probably seen those play services updates.
[00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:40.240]   They happen automatically.
[00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:44.160]   So Google says we don't develop the patches ourselves.
[00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:49.400]   We welcome patches with a report for consideration other than notifying OEMs we will not be able
[00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:53.880]   to take action on any report that is affecting versions before 4.4.
[00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:58.240]   The fixed Google says is KitKat.
[00:17:58.240 --> 00:17:59.240]   Just update your device.
[00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:01.240]   It's a case.
[00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:03.680]   It's simple.
[00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:05.960]   I don't think you could fault Google for this to be honest.
[00:18:05.960 --> 00:18:08.360]   I mean maybe they should have thought of it.
[00:18:08.360 --> 00:18:11.160]   They didn't set up a way to do this in the past.
[00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:13.360]   They do have a way now.
[00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:14.360]   Right.
[00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:15.360]   Here's a good question.
[00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:18.400]   PSChops asks in the chatroom, have we seen exploits?
[00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:19.400]   Mm-hmm.
[00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:27.080]   I think from what I read the researchers have discovered these exploits and they have been
[00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:28.080]   rolled in.
[00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:30.800]   But I mean they've discovered the holes.
[00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:32.640]   Have they been exploited actively?
[00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:34.840]   I suppose that's a really good question.
[00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:40.240]   Can I show a point out Apple does not fix bugs in iOS 4.
[00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:42.720]   Microsoft doesn't fix bugs in Windows XP.
[00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:43.720]   Right.
[00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:44.720]   I mean, anymore.
[00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:47.160]   But they did for a pretty long time.
[00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:48.160]   Right.
[00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:49.160]   And so that's the issue.
[00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:50.160]   Because of the market share.
[00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:51.160]   Right.
[00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:52.160]   Jelly Bean is so many users of XP.
[00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:53.160]   Right.
[00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:55.160]   Jelly Bean isn't that old.
[00:18:55.160 --> 00:18:56.400]   Yeah.
[00:18:56.400 --> 00:18:59.840]   So the fix.
[00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:00.880]   There's, I don't know what the fix is.
[00:19:00.880 --> 00:19:02.640]   You have to get a new phone.
[00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:08.040]   I guess with all of those companies they're hoping at some point it's a tradeoff between
[00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:17.000]   do you help or fix or do you kind of use that as a stick to get people up?
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   Yeah.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:23.160]   That's why this Google Microsoft thing timing couldn't be worse for Google.
[00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:29.600]   Because Microsoft says see they're not fixing their, well, our flaw.
[00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:32.000]   But there's this arguably not as fixable.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   I mean the Microsoft one.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   That's what I would submit.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   Yeah.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.400]   Microsoft and all desktop operating systems have a mechanism for fixing.
[00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:42.680]   And apparently Microsoft said we've got regular fixes coming out in a couple of days.
[00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:43.680]   Could you wait?
[00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:45.040]   That's right.
[00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:46.880]   And Google said no.
[00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:48.800]   They should have waited to patch Tuesday.
[00:19:48.800 --> 00:19:49.800]   Yeah.
[00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:53.680]   So I think there's a little, there's a little.
[00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:55.520]   It's a little FU in there.
[00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:56.520]   Yeah.
[00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:58.000]   Something for both sides.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.920]   All right.
[00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:00.920]   Let's take a break.
[00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:07.440]   We're going to talk about title two.
[00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:09.680]   Self-driving cars, Google domains.
[00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:12.160]   We should put that in the, are we going to do a change log?
[00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:14.200]   Jeff, what do you think?
[00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:16.960]   We did such a bad job without Gina last time.
[00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:17.960]   We did.
[00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:18.960]   We did.
[00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:20.120]   I think we incorporated it.
[00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:22.040]   We'll just incorporate it in.
[00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:23.040]   So you can retire the trumpets.
[00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:24.040]   Oh.
[00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:26.040]   Do we have, do we have a change log here?
[00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:27.040]   Oh yeah.
[00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:29.400]   Well, I put a few things in there that would be changed a lot worthy.
[00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:30.400]   I see.
[00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:31.400]   What do you mean that's pathetic?
[00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:33.400]   No, if you don't fancy a producer, we love you.
[00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:34.400]   But two things.
[00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:35.400]   Two things.
[00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:36.400]   You know, I'm going to put it.
[00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:37.400]   She did find a lot of those things.
[00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:38.400]   She worked hard.
[00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:40.000]   You know, we miss her.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:41.560]   I'm just putting another one in.
[00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:42.560]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:43.560]   I'm sure there's a movement.
[00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:44.560]   I put another one in here.
[00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:45.560]   The effort to keep her.
[00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:46.560]   The effort to keep her.
[00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:48.560]   I even, it wasn't my job to do.
[00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:49.560]   So I had no authority.
[00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:51.040]   But I said, what if we go to the change log?
[00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:52.040]   Yes.
[00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:53.040]   Let's work.
[00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:54.040]   Anything.
[00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:55.040]   All right.
[00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:56.040]   We'll do the change log.
[00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:57.840]   We got four things now.
[00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:58.840]   Three things.
[00:20:58.840 --> 00:21:00.840]   I'm putting some in there.
[00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:04.480]   Our show today brought to you by Hip Chat.
[00:21:04.480 --> 00:21:06.640]   See if we had, you know what?
[00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:07.640]   We do have Hip Chat.
[00:21:07.640 --> 00:21:08.640]   Let's set it up.
[00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:10.240]   We should have a host Hip Chat.
[00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:12.640]   Hip Chat is a great way for a team to stay in touch.
[00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:17.680]   We started using it with our web design team for kitchens as we create a new web page,
[00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:20.280]   a website for Twitch.
[00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:21.680]   And I was so blown away.
[00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:23.760]   And then I realized, oh, this is from Alaska.
[00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:25.840]   This is, and they're using Jira at Fort Kitchen.
[00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:28.000]   So it made it a perfect relationship.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:34.760]   Hip Chat plus is a way of keeping teams on the same page.
[00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:37.560]   Not just IM.
[00:21:37.560 --> 00:21:40.840]   It's better than email because email, you know, is kind of asynchronous.
[00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:41.840]   Well, I don't know.
[00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:42.840]   It's better.
[00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:43.960]   I can't describe it.
[00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:44.960]   It's so much better.
[00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:46.360]   It gets the thing done.
[00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:51.640]   So you got IM, you got texting, you got cloud storage, documents, sharing apps, you're
[00:21:51.640 --> 00:21:52.960]   probably using all of them.
[00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:55.400]   But Hip Chat puts it all in one place.
[00:21:55.400 --> 00:22:02.080]   And video chat, document sharing, screen sharing, system updates, code sharing, it
[00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:06.960]   integrates into 57 services like GitHub, Jira, Zendesk and more.
[00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:11.800]   So, you know, you got a website monitoring service, integrates it in and Hip Chat becomes
[00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:16.200]   your kind of dashboard for everything that's going on.
[00:22:16.200 --> 00:22:17.200]   Emails too slow.
[00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:18.200]   Meetings get side tracked.
[00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:19.880]   Regular IM doesn't work.
[00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:20.880]   Hip Chat plus.
[00:22:20.880 --> 00:22:22.120]   Plus, you can go back in time.
[00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:25.560]   So like email, it's a record of everything you've talked about and done.
[00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:27.400]   It's easy to set up fun to use.
[00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:28.400]   Your team will love it.
[00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:29.400]   We love it.
[00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:30.400]   It makes your team while they productive it.
[00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:38.560]   Oh, and by the way, iOS, Android, Linux, Windows, Mac, everywhere you are.
[00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:39.560]   And even the web.
[00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:41.480]   So that actually means it's everywhere.
[00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:43.800]   The web based version works on everything.
[00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:45.120]   Hip Chat.com/trig.
[00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:48.000]   I want you to try Hip Chat plus for free.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:49.480]   You don't need to give them a credit card.
[00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:50.480]   Don't worry.
[00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:55.120]   Just go to hipchat.com/twig.
[00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:57.880]   Click on Start Chatting to sign up and invite a few team members.
[00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:00.040]   All the features will be free for 30 days.
[00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:04.040]   Actually, for the first 100 signups that we do, they're going to extend that 30 day
[00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:05.040]   free trial in 90 days.
[00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:06.040]   So sign up right now.
[00:23:06.040 --> 00:23:07.040]   Don't wait.
[00:23:07.040 --> 00:23:10.400]   Hipchat.com/twig.
[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:12.480]   After the free trial, you can always stick with the Framium version.
[00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:13.800]   It's free forever.
[00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:18.080]   Or if you want some of these additional features, it's very affordable.
[00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:19.080]   Hipchat.com/twig.
[00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:24.440]   Free for 30 days, unless you do it right now in the first 100 signups right now, we'll
[00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:26.480]   get it for three months free.
[00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:31.480]   Hip Chat, your team, your project, in sync instantly.
[00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:35.960]   And Jeff will send you a link because we have set up Hip Chat.
[00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:40.880]   We use it now not only for the web designers, but our engineering team has started using
[00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:42.280]   it, our sales team has started using it.
[00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:45.320]   I think we need to host some producers, Hip Chat, Jason.
[00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:46.320]   I think that'd be very helpful.
[00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:51.200]   That way we can foment revolt against you, boss.
[00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:52.840]   You can do that.
[00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:53.840]   Hey.
[00:23:53.840 --> 00:23:54.840]   Yeah.
[00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:55.840]   Why not?
[00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:56.840]   I'm all for it.
[00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:57.840]   I see.
[00:23:57.840 --> 00:23:58.840]   I'm a Democrat.
[00:23:58.840 --> 00:23:59.840]   I'm a egalitarian.
[00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:01.560]   If you guys want to overthrow, fine.
[00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:02.800]   I'll retire.
[00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:05.360]   I'll move to the Seychell Islands.
[00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:06.360]   Enjoy the sand beach.
[00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:08.760]   White sand beaches.
[00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:10.240]   My ties.
[00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:11.240]   The endless my ties.
[00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:12.240]   Do you know who else?
[00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:13.840]   I've lived there for a year.
[00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:15.440]   Did they like it?
[00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:16.800]   They loved it.
[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:18.720]   Is it Dutch?
[00:24:18.720 --> 00:24:19.720]   It is not Dutch.
[00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:28.080]   It's sort of a weird amalgam of French and British and the local culture.
[00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:29.080]   Perfect.
[00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:30.080]   That's what I want.
[00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:32.000]   It's paradise, effectively.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:37.440]   The Republic, the Seychelles, they actually have a Creole.
[00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:38.440]   Yeah.
[00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:44.280]   And the only thing I remember is there's a replica of Big Ben in the main square on the
[00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:45.280]   main island.
[00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:49.280]   And it rings twice just in case you were sleeping through the first one.
[00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:53.640]   A lot of nap times in the Seychelles.
[00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:56.360]   It's 115 islands in the Indian Ocean.
[00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:57.360]   Wow.
[00:24:57.360 --> 00:24:59.800]   I want to move there.
[00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:03.080]   Well, I'm retiring there.
[00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:04.080]   What?
[00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:05.080]   Nope.
[00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:09.080]   Internet access is not great.
[00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:11.680]   No, that's why I'm going there.
[00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:16.760]   That's precisely why I'm going to the Seychelles Islands.
[00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:18.120]   So Kevin Rose is retiring.
[00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:19.120]   Well, not exactly.
[00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:20.120]   He's leaving.
[00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:21.120]   Of course, we...
[00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:22.120]   Retiring.
[00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:23.280]   I was going to wear my dig four.
[00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:24.920]   It was my idea shirt.
[00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:26.880]   I should have.
[00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:27.880]   He was at Google Ventures.
[00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:28.960]   Remember, he found a dig.
[00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:30.480]   He worked with us on the screen savers.
[00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:33.400]   He's been on many times on our shows.
[00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:41.200]   And he started a iOS app incubator called Milk, which he then sold to Google, joined
[00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:43.520]   Google Ventures.
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:45.720]   And then he's backed down because he wanted to go back to app development.
[00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:47.200]   Now he's going to do that.
[00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:49.320]   His company North Technologies.
[00:25:49.320 --> 00:25:51.960]   He's a formerly left Google Ventures.
[00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:53.760]   And of course, it has raised $5 million.
[00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:55.760]   I think he's wonderful.
[00:25:55.760 --> 00:25:56.760]   Yeah.
[00:25:56.760 --> 00:25:58.760]   He's got 5 million Adventure Fund.
[00:25:58.760 --> 00:26:00.600]   The next app that lists to the story.
[00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:01.600]   What's the second app?
[00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:02.600]   Sorry.
[00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:03.600]   Yeah.
[00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:04.600]   It sounds just obnoxious.
[00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:05.840]   Well, I have to...
[00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:07.840]   I need a watch ville.
[00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:09.720]   Yeah, I have watch ville too.
[00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:10.720]   So yeah.
[00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:11.720]   Yeah, come on.
[00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:13.720]   No, but that's just Kevin.
[00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:14.720]   Okay.
[00:26:14.720 --> 00:26:16.880]   You could have written that in my sleep.
[00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:17.880]   I could have written that in my sleep.
[00:26:17.880 --> 00:26:18.880]   Wildly overpriced watches.
[00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:19.880]   No, that's right.
[00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:20.880]   It's basically...
[00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:21.920]   It's not even an app really.
[00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:24.720]   It just aggregates watch blogs.
[00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:26.000]   And there are quite a few of them.
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   I think he's smart.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:34.680]   I think that the Apple Watch, especially the edition, the solid gold Apple Watch, is going
[00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:38.360]   to jumpstart an interest in watches, in old school watches.
[00:26:38.360 --> 00:26:39.360]   Good watch.
[00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:41.720]   He's always been a watch collector ever since he got rich anyway.
[00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:42.720]   I know.
[00:26:42.720 --> 00:26:45.000]   There are people that have friends who are that way too, but I always make fun of them
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:48.800]   because when the revolution comes people, you're getting time next.
[00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:55.040]   It's weird to wear something on your wrist that costs more than your house.
[00:26:55.040 --> 00:26:56.040]   What is jewelry?
[00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:57.040]   What do you want?
[00:26:57.040 --> 00:26:58.040]   A few people do that?
[00:26:58.040 --> 00:26:59.040]   Oh, yeah.
[00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:00.040]   Real people.
[00:27:00.040 --> 00:27:01.040]   Oh, yeah.
[00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:02.840]   Well, down here, you could afford a watch like that.
[00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:04.800]   You have a much more expensive house.
[00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:05.800]   Yeah.
[00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:07.040]   I would assume.
[00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:10.720]   So it's kind of a piggyback thing.
[00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:11.720]   Housewives.
[00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:21.280]   I had a friend who said he had gotten a great deal and a watch and it was 65% off and it
[00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:24.200]   was $25,000.
[00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:28.920]   And I said, I don't know where you live, but it's not in the world's same world.
[00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:30.320]   No, I know.
[00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:31.320]   It's weird.
[00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:32.320]   Well, it's jewelry.
[00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:33.320]   It's not about the time.
[00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:34.920]   It's not about function.
[00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:40.560]   Anyway, I have both of Kevin's app because I'm a friend and a fan.
[00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:46.760]   I think two years, Kevin's going to sell that new venture thing back to Google and come
[00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:47.760]   of VC again.
[00:27:47.760 --> 00:27:49.800]   Yeah, for $100 million.
[00:27:49.800 --> 00:27:51.760]   He's a smart man.
[00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:52.760]   He made money on every.
[00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:54.920]   He's made money on everything.
[00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:57.560]   Did he make money on dig?
[00:27:57.560 --> 00:28:01.080]   I think probably not, but I don't know.
[00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:04.800]   I don't pretend to know because he's, you know, I don't ask him those questions.
[00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:08.720]   But I think he made money on revision three.
[00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:10.400]   Dig probably not.
[00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:11.400]   Although, wait a minute.
[00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:12.400]   I'm sorry.
[00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:13.400]   He did.
[00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:14.400]   You know why?
[00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:15.400]   Because he took money off the table during one of the venture.
[00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:16.400]   Oh, did he okay?
[00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:21.600]   So that's the thing, you know, founders do is you get a $15 million venture round and
[00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:25.640]   you go, and by the way, I'm taking two.
[00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:26.640]   So he did.
[00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:30.920]   I know he took at least a million off the table in one of the dig rounds, not because
[00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:34.280]   he told me because it was public knowledge.
[00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:37.160]   So let's go back to Title II.
[00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:38.160]   Title II revisited.
[00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:45.080]   What do you folks in Canada think about this whole regulate in the Internet thing?
[00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:49.280]   We're in favor of it.
[00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:52.400]   Government regulation of things is hugely popular in Canada.
[00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:53.400]   Yeah.
[00:28:53.400 --> 00:29:01.880]   No, I mean, I'm personally not in favor of it, but there's, we have a history of government
[00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:03.080]   regulating everything.
[00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:07.840]   It's actually my sense that Canadian Internet service providers are some of the first to
[00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:10.440]   do things like paid prioritization.
[00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:11.440]   Mm-hmm.
[00:29:11.440 --> 00:29:15.040]   And was it, tell us that you stood block Skype?
[00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:16.040]   One of them did.
[00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:17.040]   Oh, yeah.
[00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:18.840]   And the stories are legion.
[00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:26.680]   I remember writing about cable and Rogers was the first to come up with nice sounding
[00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:33.080]   ways of like packet shaping or band with management and so on.
[00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:36.440]   And what they really meant was throttling BitTorrent.
[00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:37.440]   Right.
[00:29:37.440 --> 00:29:40.320]   And, you know, that was just, it was no big deal.
[00:29:40.320 --> 00:29:44.960]   I don't even, I mean, people complain, but I don't remember anybody at that time, at
[00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:48.560]   least turning it into, you know, a sort of policy issue.
[00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:51.960]   I mean, I remember when Shaw cable.
[00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:54.560]   Shaw, that's who was, that's who was doing it.
[00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:58.520]   Yeah, Shaw was a big Western cable provider.
[00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:00.800]   They came up with Internet telephony.
[00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:01.800]   Right.
[00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:06.240]   And I remember saying to a guy, an analyst, oh, well, that means they can compete with,
[00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:10.640]   you know, the other with the real telecom companies and drive prices down and he laughed.
[00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:12.360]   And he said, are you insane?
[00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:14.080]   Why would they do that?
[00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:18.640]   They'll just put their prices up to exactly the same height within 15 cents or so and
[00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:23.360]   everybody will make a boatload of money, which is exactly what happened.
[00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:27.320]   And then they started doing things like, I remember very well after an hour on Skype,
[00:30:27.320 --> 00:30:28.480]   you would just, that would be it.
[00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:29.480]   That's all you get.
[00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:31.240]   It's all you get.
[00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:36.400]   So the company that, by the way, does all this deep packet inspection for Comcast and
[00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:39.680]   others is in Waterloo.
[00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:42.200]   It's called Sandvine.
[00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:46.960]   And they, they make the box that at least for a while Comcast was using to block BitTorrent
[00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:49.840]   and other things that it looks into the traffic.
[00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:52.680]   They call it traffic optimization.
[00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:54.880]   With shaping.
[00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:56.520]   In bandwidth shaping.
[00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:57.520]   We're just talking.
[00:30:57.520 --> 00:30:58.520]   Like landscaping.
[00:30:58.520 --> 00:30:59.520]   Yes.
[00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:02.960]   It's bandscaping.
[00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:07.640]   Revenue generation, traffic optimization, network security.
[00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:09.320]   That's Sandvine.
[00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:14.600]   So this is not illegal, but they're also, as you can see, widely used by ISPs all over
[00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:19.360]   the world to keep an eye on what the subscribers are doing.
[00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:23.680]   Well, and Rogers was very good at, in fact, they all did, but Rogers was very good at
[00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:28.960]   kind of portraying itself as, you know, we're just doing this to help you guys because
[00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:34.640]   you, the normal internet user are having all your bandwidth sucked up by these guys
[00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:38.960]   and pajamas and their mom's basement, you know, bit twerning, everything.
[00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:40.360]   Bandwidth hogs.
[00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:44.440]   How dare they?
[00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:47.400]   Traffic classification technology for meaningful insight.
[00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:49.920]   That's what they call it.
[00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:54.080]   For communication service providers, DPI is the foundation that enables the delivery
[00:31:54.080 --> 00:31:57.200]   at advanced services.
[00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:01.240]   That classification for actionable data.
[00:32:01.240 --> 00:32:02.760]   That's it right there.
[00:32:02.760 --> 00:32:03.760]   Yeah.
[00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:04.760]   That's it.
[00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:05.760]   Actionable.
[00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:06.760]   Actionable.
[00:32:06.760 --> 00:32:09.960]   Like call the RIAA.
[00:32:09.960 --> 00:32:16.960]   Anyway, the FCC, I don't know whether you, whether you subscribe, certainly the CRTC
[00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:20.760]   in Canada is, is this bad, but I don't know whether you subscribe to the notion the FCC
[00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:26.200]   is trying to protect consumers or trying to protect themselves or trying to protect providers
[00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:33.440]   Tom Wheeler, who President Obama made the chairman of the FCC kind of notorious for
[00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:38.160]   having been a lobbyist for both cable and wireless companies in his previous life.
[00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:43.320]   Nevertheless, says February next month, about a month from now, in fact, I think the 25th,
[00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:49.040]   the FCC will decide and he indicates they're going to go for Title II, which we've all
[00:32:49.040 --> 00:32:56.320]   been talking about, Title II is the section of the Telecommunications Act of 1934, updated
[00:32:56.320 --> 00:33:05.000]   in the 90s that says that basically allows the FCC to regulate broadband providers as
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.120]   common carriers.
[00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:11.760]   He says, we're going to do it, but we're going to use forbearance to keep from overdoing
[00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:14.200]   the regulation, but it does allow us.
[00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:17.240]   Now Verizon says, no, no, we'll sue anyway.
[00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:19.240]   It's going to go on and on at court.
[00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:24.800]   I think the hard part, the hard part is that, you know, I've talked to lots of people about
[00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:25.800]   Title II.
[00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:30.280]   We've written about it a lot at GigaOMs, Tacey, Haganbotham, it's, you know, knows it inside
[00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:32.280]   and out.
[00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:41.160]   And I mean, the problem is the tradeoff is you either have Comcast buying everyone and
[00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:45.400]   then doing whatever it wants to the internet or you have the government trying to regulate
[00:33:45.400 --> 00:33:46.400]   the internet.
[00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:51.400]   It's like choosing between getting stabbed in the eye and getting shot, you know, in
[00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:52.400]   the butter or something.
[00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:56.320]   Like there is no, neither one of those is particularly great.
[00:33:56.320 --> 00:34:01.360]   Like in order to buy.
[00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:07.280]   But the argument is made that the neutrality is internet regulation, but our dear Senator
[00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:13.600]   Al Franken argues instead that no, what it is is trying to stop, is trying to keep the
[00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:18.560]   internet the way it is and just prevent kind of a takeover of the internet by the companies
[00:34:18.560 --> 00:34:19.800]   and chain.
[00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:22.400]   I know I am a courage.
[00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:23.400]   Go ahead.
[00:34:23.400 --> 00:34:28.520]   And I think Title II, I mean, the principle of Title II is that, you know, it's a pipe
[00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:30.240]   and it should carry things.
[00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:34.920]   I'm trying to remember the phrasing that David Weinberger used in the update to the
[00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:41.320]   Cloutrain Manifesto, but, you know, it's it bits should flow and they should not be restricted
[00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:45.960]   based on where they come from or who paid for them or, you know, that and theoretically,
[00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:49.640]   at least that's the way Title II is supposed to operate or should operate.
[00:34:49.640 --> 00:34:50.640]   Right.
[00:34:50.640 --> 00:34:56.560]   I'm encouraged by this most recent call from the president and the FCC saying, and this
[00:34:56.560 --> 00:35:03.480]   is the other side of the coin, yet regulation, but also competition is a solution.
[00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:07.720]   And you know, 19 states in the US have laws that prohibit municipal Wi-Fi.
[00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:08.720]   Right.
[00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:09.720]   And that's ridiculous.
[00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:15.520]   I know Tim Wu and Susan Crawford, both I think have said, if you're going to like, there
[00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:22.600]   needs to be more options for communities to have competitive providers.
[00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:28.160]   And if it's actually literally against the law to have someone do that, that's a problem.
[00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:31.960]   It's not enough to just have Title II and have FCC telling people what to do.
[00:35:31.960 --> 00:35:37.160]   You need to help incentivize more competition in regions as well.
[00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:40.960]   I have to commend Obama because, you know, in the campaign, he said he would do this and
[00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:44.400]   then it seemed like with the appointed Tom Wheeler, oh my God, he's gone the opposite
[00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:45.400]   way.
[00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:49.320]   But he did, you know, in a speech say, Title II, we got to do Title II.
[00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:55.480]   And now the White House says it wants to end laws that harm broadband service competition.
[00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:59.680]   I think this is actually this is the best possible outcome.
[00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:01.400]   This is from the report.
[00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:06.240]   Laws in 19 states, some specifically written by special interests, trying to stifle competition,
[00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:08.840]   have held back broadband access.
[00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:13.800]   Today the president is announcing a new effort to support local choice in broadband, formally
[00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:19.200]   opposing them measures that limit the range of options available to communities.
[00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:24.240]   They're filing a letter with the FCC saying, you know, we'd like your support in this.
[00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:28.760]   The FCC is apparently already examining state laws and considering whether it can invalidate
[00:36:28.760 --> 00:36:36.120]   them by using its authority to promote competition in local telecom markets.
[00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:42.120]   This would be things like not only municipalities offering Wi-Fi, but in some cases municipalities
[00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:46.760]   taking over the infrastructure and providing internet.
[00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:48.920]   There were a couple of lawsuits.
[00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:55.040]   I remember a couple of municipalities, Chattanooga, Tennessee, for instance, provides internet
[00:36:55.040 --> 00:36:56.560]   to everybody in Chattanooga.
[00:36:56.560 --> 00:37:00.040]   And it's doing, it's a great solution.
[00:37:00.040 --> 00:37:03.800]   A lot of people have called for, and we've talked about this a lot.
[00:37:03.800 --> 00:37:12.680]   In fact, the guy who brought it to my attention first was one of the creators of Lotus 123.
[00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:15.360]   Well, no, not Mitch Capeport.
[00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:16.360]   A VisiCalc.
[00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:19.200]   Let's go back even farther.
[00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:22.920]   And he said the thing that municipalities should do is use the right of eminent domain,
[00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:28.400]   take over the infrastructure and then sell it back, rent it back to a variety of providers
[00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:30.520]   so that there's competition.
[00:37:30.520 --> 00:37:36.720]   It's like the water and power, it can be run by the municipalities, by the local governments.
[00:37:36.720 --> 00:37:41.960]   But the service on top of it can be provided by private companies who compete with each
[00:37:41.960 --> 00:37:49.920]   other for price performance, bandwidth shaping, fast lanes and all of that.
[00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:56.640]   I mean, there is an argument if you buy the sort of public highway or water utility argument
[00:37:56.640 --> 00:38:02.720]   that the actual infrastructure should be available to anyone and that private companies should
[00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:06.000]   basically have to bid to run their services on top of it.
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:10.960]   Instead, we give them in the states anyway, we give them monopolies.
[00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:16.280]   So the last week, Tom Wheeler, the chairman of the FCC proposed changing the definition
[00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:18.120]   of broadband.
[00:38:18.120 --> 00:38:22.000]   See, one of the ways that they get away with this is by saying, "Well, broadband is 4 megabits
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:24.760]   downstream, 1 megabits upstream."
[00:38:24.760 --> 00:38:29.600]   And if you talk about that, 75% consumers have a choice of two or more providers.
[00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:33.320]   If you really define broadband as it should be, and this is what Wheeler is proposing,
[00:38:33.320 --> 00:38:37.080]   is 25 megabits down and 3 megabits up.
[00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:48.040]   That's what you'd need to watch video to use all the modern services, then 3 out of 4
[00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:52.440]   Americans, 75% Americans have no choice at all.
[00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:54.040]   They do not have a choice between providers.
[00:38:54.040 --> 00:39:03.000]   There is one incumbent provider who could provide true broadband in 75% of areas.
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:04.960]   That's why there's no competition.
[00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:08.920]   Obama is speaking today at an Internet service provider in Iowa.
[00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:09.920]   Go ahead.
[00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:12.560]   I apologize, my lag is bad.
[00:39:12.560 --> 00:39:14.000]   Jeff has a terrible connection.
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   Yeah, I'm sorry.
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   Yes.
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   It's awful.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:18.720]   Well, here's an example.
[00:39:18.720 --> 00:39:21.600]   I'm paying for 50 down and 50 up on files.
[00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:23.600]   You're not getting it, dude.
[00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:25.600]   Are you bit turning it back?
[00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:26.800]   I'm going to do a speed test.
[00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:28.080]   It's 50 down and 50 up.
[00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:29.080]   Are you bit turning?
[00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:30.080]   Not running anything.
[00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:31.080]   Jake's not here.
[00:39:31.080 --> 00:39:36.080]   I know he's not running anything.
[00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:39.080]   I always wonder if Obama's...
[00:39:39.080 --> 00:39:42.600]   This is like the equivalent of him just doing immigration and closing Guantanamo in the
[00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:43.600]   mo.
[00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:48.720]   And it's the Internet equivalent of that of saying let's just do this stuff and make
[00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:49.720]   it get going.
[00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:51.720]   Except that he never did close Guantanamo.
[00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:56.320]   Well, yeah, no, that's why I'm fearing that.
[00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:57.320]   Yeah.
[00:39:57.320 --> 00:39:58.840]   He's opposed to new guests.
[00:39:58.840 --> 00:39:59.840]   New guests.
[00:39:59.840 --> 00:40:00.840]   They're not accepting any new guests.
[00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:01.840]   That's a start.
[00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:02.840]   So he's in Cedar Falls.
[00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:04.760]   He's speaking right now, actually.
[00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:07.280]   Ohio was first gigabit city.
[00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:12.560]   I'm trying to think if it's a municipal Y, municipal Internet?
[00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:18.560]   Yeah, he showed a graph or a chart of high speed in other countries.
[00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:23.280]   And so it was South Korea and then wherever Tokyo cities.
[00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:26.880]   And then the first one in the US was Cedar Falls.
[00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:27.880]   Right.
[00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:33.680]   And Iowa was a really good test case because there's a two-thirds of...
[00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:34.680]   Iowans are in rural areas.
[00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:41.320]   There's a huge rural population that isn't well served.
[00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:45.520]   To me, it's an issue of equality.
[00:40:45.520 --> 00:40:48.540]   If you don't have access to high speed Internet, it's not just that you can't watch
[00:40:48.540 --> 00:40:49.540]   Netflix.
[00:40:49.540 --> 00:40:54.120]   You can't really participate in the world.
[00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:59.600]   And it's an issue of just economic development.
[00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:02.480]   Municipalities should be able to do this.
[00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:08.600]   I know that at one point Mark Andreessen did a sort of tweet storm talking about net neutrality,
[00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:13.840]   which I then aggregated in my job as a journalist.
[00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:21.740]   And one of the core arguments was that he believes we're going to need orders of magnitude
[00:41:21.740 --> 00:41:25.740]   more bandwidth to do telepresidents and all the 3D modeling.
[00:41:25.740 --> 00:41:30.660]   Imagine the educational opportunities that can be provided in rural areas if they have
[00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:31.660]   high speed.
[00:41:31.660 --> 00:41:40.220]   But his argument is that if we have Title II, basically he was saying we need the owners
[00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:44.720]   of these networks to invest hugely in more bandwidth.
[00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:50.040]   If we make it less economically viable for them, they won't do that.
[00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:53.880]   Well, and that's exactly...
[00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:59.240]   Should we call Jeff back?
[00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:03.320]   Because I don't want this to just be me and Matthew.
[00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:04.320]   Let's take it.
[00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:08.960]   Not that there's anything wrong with that.
[00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:10.900]   I wouldn't mind getting...
[00:42:10.900 --> 00:42:12.140]   I know Jeff has a lot to say.
[00:42:12.140 --> 00:42:14.740]   He's probably right now fairly frustrated.
[00:42:14.740 --> 00:42:23.140]   So I'll wait for a little bit here before we go on.
[00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:37.620]   I wonder why he says it's 50/50.
[00:42:37.620 --> 00:42:40.600]   That might be an example of bandwidth shaping.
[00:42:40.600 --> 00:42:42.280]   I got to tell you a story.
[00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:50.360]   Rogers, who I use, I saw an ad just randomly in the newspaper a year or so ago and it said,
[00:42:50.360 --> 00:42:56.600]   "Hey, if you sign up now for Rogers Extreme, you'll get 30 megabits or something like that."
[00:42:56.600 --> 00:42:58.960]   And I thought, "30 megabits, wait a second.
[00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:00.480]   I've got Rogers Extreme.
[00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:02.840]   I've been paying for it for two years.
[00:43:02.840 --> 00:43:04.680]   I get like eight megabits."
[00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:09.860]   So I phoned Rogers and the guy says, "Oh yeah, all you have to do is go in and get a new
[00:43:09.860 --> 00:43:11.260]   router."
[00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:12.260]   And then...
[00:43:12.260 --> 00:43:16.820]   So I literally just went and got a new router and boom, 25 megabits.
[00:43:16.820 --> 00:43:19.260]   But had Rogers told me that?
[00:43:19.260 --> 00:43:23.720]   Had they sent me anything saying, "You can upgrade to a faster speed if you get a new
[00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:24.720]   router?"
[00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:29.940]   No, they literally never mentioned it because they don't want me to get that high speed.
[00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:32.540]   They want me to keep paying for the low speed.
[00:43:32.540 --> 00:43:39.900]   Why would they want to give me more bandwidth for the same amount of money?
[00:43:39.900 --> 00:43:42.900]   So now, can we not get him back?
[00:43:42.900 --> 00:43:43.900]   He's offline right now.
[00:43:43.900 --> 00:43:46.420]   So that's the question.
[00:43:46.420 --> 00:43:47.740]   He says, "I have 50/50."
[00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:49.020]   He says, "Do a speed test."
[00:43:49.020 --> 00:43:51.260]   Yeah, I think he's...
[00:43:51.260 --> 00:43:53.060]   Right now, he just did a full machinery test.
[00:43:53.060 --> 00:43:56.100]   I'm not sure I'd blame Verizon for this though.
[00:43:56.100 --> 00:43:58.020]   It's a Chromebook.
[00:43:58.020 --> 00:43:59.020]   I think really.
[00:43:59.020 --> 00:44:01.860]   Jeff is insisting on using some very odd technology.
[00:44:01.860 --> 00:44:08.460]   Well, he also said in chat, "I think he's ready to go the Mac mini route."
[00:44:08.460 --> 00:44:09.460]   Good.
[00:44:09.460 --> 00:44:10.460]   Well, buy him one.
[00:44:10.460 --> 00:44:11.460]   Yeah, that's what I figured.
[00:44:11.460 --> 00:44:12.460]   He doesn't have to use it.
[00:44:12.460 --> 00:44:14.460]   All right, I'm giving him a call right now.
[00:44:14.460 --> 00:44:15.460]   He can stay pure.
[00:44:15.460 --> 00:44:16.460]   Let's see here.
[00:44:16.460 --> 00:44:19.740]   Yeah, Tiltozar, cool breeze is exactly right.
[00:44:19.740 --> 00:44:27.260]   He's an old friend of mine who is one of the members of the Bay Area Internet Service
[00:44:27.260 --> 00:44:28.260]   providers.
[00:44:28.260 --> 00:44:30.460]   I can't remember what he's bowing.
[00:44:30.460 --> 00:44:34.020]   Anyway, he's very much about community internet.
[00:44:34.020 --> 00:44:37.260]   But it's not Dan Bricklin, it's the other guy.
[00:44:37.260 --> 00:44:39.860]   I should have read this.
[00:44:39.860 --> 00:44:42.260]   Yeah, my good friend.
[00:44:42.260 --> 00:44:45.020]   Yeah, I know.
[00:44:45.020 --> 00:44:46.260]   I'm going to look it up.
[00:44:46.260 --> 00:44:47.660]   The Google will tell me.
[00:44:47.660 --> 00:44:48.660]   Bob Frankston.
[00:44:48.660 --> 00:44:50.260]   Thanks for your brought Frankston.
[00:44:50.260 --> 00:44:51.260]   Rob is great.
[00:44:51.260 --> 00:44:52.260]   Yeah.
[00:44:52.260 --> 00:44:56.060]   And he's very much been taking this on as a community internet is the solution.
[00:44:56.060 --> 00:44:58.860]   Jeff, we're going to get you a Mac mini.
[00:44:58.860 --> 00:45:01.740]   I just I'm hard to feed.
[00:45:01.740 --> 00:45:02.740]   I'm going to.
[00:45:02.740 --> 00:45:07.580]   Yeah, because I think I don't think we can blame Verizon on this one.
[00:45:07.580 --> 00:45:11.940]   I think this is just we got to figure out why not blame Verizon.
[00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:13.780]   It's certainly worth doing all the time.
[00:45:13.780 --> 00:45:17.060]   If this isn't their fault, something similar to this.
[00:45:17.060 --> 00:45:18.300]   It ought to be their fault.
[00:45:18.300 --> 00:45:19.660]   All right, so Jeff, we have you back.
[00:45:19.660 --> 00:45:21.820]   I'm not sure we have the right mic though.
[00:45:21.820 --> 00:45:23.660]   Oh, not again.
[00:45:23.660 --> 00:45:24.660]   Yeah.
[00:45:24.660 --> 00:45:25.660]   No.
[00:45:25.660 --> 00:45:28.900]   Well, we're not getting that talk back that we were.
[00:45:28.900 --> 00:45:33.700]   I've been right in the fader the whole show to try and minimize the echo.
[00:45:33.700 --> 00:45:35.820]   But how am I now?
[00:45:35.820 --> 00:45:37.340]   Hey, there we go.
[00:45:37.340 --> 00:45:38.340]   Sounds better.
[00:45:38.340 --> 00:45:39.340]   We get in talk.
[00:45:39.340 --> 00:45:40.340]   All right, guys.
[00:45:40.340 --> 00:45:41.340]   Check, check, check, check, check.
[00:45:41.340 --> 00:45:42.340]   No, no, no, it's fine.
[00:45:42.340 --> 00:45:43.340]   I just I didn't want to leave you out.
[00:45:43.340 --> 00:45:45.140]   I feel like this is such a this is your.
[00:45:45.140 --> 00:45:46.140]   Yeah, I know.
[00:45:46.140 --> 00:45:47.940]   It's my thing and I didn't want to be awful.
[00:45:47.940 --> 00:45:48.940]   It was a terrible lag.
[00:45:48.940 --> 00:45:53.420]   So I'm just jumping and we'll be very patient.
[00:45:53.420 --> 00:45:54.420]   Is it okay now?
[00:45:54.420 --> 00:45:55.420]   Is it?
[00:45:55.420 --> 00:45:59.500]   Yeah, it sounds great right now and it sounds like maybe the lag is minimized as well.
[00:45:59.500 --> 00:46:00.500]   Good.
[00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:01.500]   Picture is not great.
[00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:06.140]   That's what indicates probably we're going to go into Mac mini.
[00:46:06.140 --> 00:46:07.580]   We'll pay for it, Jeff.
[00:46:07.580 --> 00:46:10.700]   Seriously, and what I would suggest and some of our hosts do this is just dedicated.
[00:46:10.700 --> 00:46:12.420]   It doesn't you don't have to do it.
[00:46:12.420 --> 00:46:13.820]   Yeah, and we will buy it.
[00:46:13.820 --> 00:46:14.820]   It'll be dedicated.
[00:46:14.820 --> 00:46:18.220]   We'll set it all up and that's I think Steve does that.
[00:46:18.220 --> 00:46:19.940]   A lot of our hosts do that.
[00:46:19.940 --> 00:46:21.340]   I'll take one too.
[00:46:21.340 --> 00:46:23.020]   Matthew, you can have one.
[00:46:23.020 --> 00:46:24.020]   It's on its way.
[00:46:24.020 --> 00:46:27.620]   Let me throw this bug up here real quick just to help you.
[00:46:27.620 --> 00:46:31.020]   We try to get our hosts to do is not use it for anything else, but just kind of leave
[00:46:31.020 --> 00:46:32.020]   it.
[00:46:32.020 --> 00:46:33.020]   That's the key.
[00:46:33.020 --> 00:46:34.020]   Yeah.
[00:46:34.020 --> 00:46:35.020]   Well, I wouldn't all still use my Chromebook for else.
[00:46:35.020 --> 00:46:36.740]   Yeah, that's the way to do it.
[00:46:36.740 --> 00:46:38.940]   I would run a bit towards or run it.
[00:46:38.940 --> 00:46:41.020]   But only the off time.
[00:46:41.020 --> 00:46:43.340]   Oh, yeah, I'll throw it a bit.
[00:46:43.340 --> 00:46:44.660]   All right, we're good to go.
[00:46:44.660 --> 00:46:46.340]   I'll start on single on Leo.
[00:46:46.340 --> 00:46:51.820]   So we were so by the way, kind of a follow up on the story we reported last week that
[00:46:51.820 --> 00:46:55.620]   Google kind of weighed in a little bit on this title to regulation by saying, oh, and
[00:46:55.620 --> 00:46:57.020]   it would give us access to utility polls.
[00:46:57.020 --> 00:47:04.220]   And of course, immediately Verizon says, nah, they always have had access to utility polls.
[00:47:04.220 --> 00:47:05.220]   They're crazy.
[00:47:05.220 --> 00:47:06.220]   They're blowing smoke.
[00:47:06.220 --> 00:47:08.700]   The NCT actually was a cable company.
[00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:10.180]   NCTA filed.
[00:47:10.180 --> 00:47:14.940]   Google can already avail itself of poll attachment rights under section 224.
[00:47:14.940 --> 00:47:17.540]   That's why they're in Austin.
[00:47:17.540 --> 00:47:18.540]   Google didn't have a comment.
[00:47:18.540 --> 00:47:22.460]   The R's technical doing this story.
[00:47:22.460 --> 00:47:25.420]   So anyway, I don't, you know what?
[00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:26.420]   That's a mighty piece.
[00:47:26.420 --> 00:47:27.420]   Boys, boys, boys.
[00:47:27.420 --> 00:47:28.420]   Yeah.
[00:47:28.420 --> 00:47:29.420]   Get along and give us our internet.
[00:47:29.420 --> 00:47:33.180]   Yeah, we just want to free and open and fast internet.
[00:47:33.180 --> 00:47:36.740]   And it seems that every other country is able to do this except us.
[00:47:36.740 --> 00:47:41.540]   Well, but then in the UK now they're going to spy on everything.
[00:47:41.540 --> 00:47:43.180]   So we talked about this.
[00:47:43.180 --> 00:47:44.500]   I'd love to get your opinions on this.
[00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:47.780]   We talked about David Cameron's speech on security now yesterday.
[00:47:47.780 --> 00:47:48.780]   Oh, man.
[00:47:48.780 --> 00:47:50.780]   I'll bet you did.
[00:47:50.780 --> 00:47:52.180]   What a train.
[00:47:52.180 --> 00:47:56.500]   And I think Corey Doctorow had a good takedown on Boing Boing.
[00:47:56.500 --> 00:47:57.500]   He did.
[00:47:57.500 --> 00:48:04.460]   So Cameron, the Prime Minister of Great Britain says that it should be illegal to make a communications
[00:48:04.460 --> 00:48:09.620]   product that the law that the home secretary can't listen in on.
[00:48:09.620 --> 00:48:11.420]   And he said, it's okay.
[00:48:11.420 --> 00:48:15.620]   You're protected because the home secretary would have to sign a warrant for us to listen
[00:48:15.620 --> 00:48:18.500]   in on.
[00:48:18.500 --> 00:48:25.100]   And now I have to say I think it's one thing for David Cameron to say that.
[00:48:25.100 --> 00:48:27.980]   It's another thing for it to actually happen.
[00:48:27.980 --> 00:48:32.540]   But what it reveals in the attitude, this is a Green Wall's argument, what it reveals
[00:48:32.540 --> 00:48:36.900]   is just a terrible view of our rights.
[00:48:36.900 --> 00:48:37.900]   Right.
[00:48:37.900 --> 00:48:40.060]   And Corey argues it's also ignorance.
[00:48:40.060 --> 00:48:42.060]   Yes, it says.
[00:48:42.060 --> 00:48:46.740]   David Cameron says there should be no means of communication, which we cannot read and
[00:48:46.740 --> 00:48:49.820]   no doubt many in his party will agree with him politically.
[00:48:49.820 --> 00:48:54.300]   But if they understood the technology, they'd be shocked to their boots.
[00:48:54.300 --> 00:48:58.900]   Corey is always eloquent in this stuff.
[00:48:58.900 --> 00:49:04.540]   So he says, Cameron doesn't know what he's asking for because in order to make this work,
[00:49:04.540 --> 00:49:07.340]   you know, you can ban WhatsApp.
[00:49:07.340 --> 00:49:14.100]   You can ban I message or Apple's messages, both of which provide encrypted message passing
[00:49:14.100 --> 00:49:18.260]   that the government can't read.
[00:49:18.260 --> 00:49:23.100]   But first of all, you sure you want to ban iOS from Great Britain?
[00:49:23.100 --> 00:49:24.100]   Okay.
[00:49:24.100 --> 00:49:27.700]   But then you can't ban Linux.
[00:49:27.700 --> 00:49:29.140]   Who do you ban?
[00:49:29.140 --> 00:49:33.100]   If you're, you know, who do you stop for Linux or BSD?
[00:49:33.100 --> 00:49:35.740]   It makes no sense.
[00:49:35.740 --> 00:49:36.740]   It makes no sense.
[00:49:36.740 --> 00:49:41.780]   And it's like saying no one is allowed to have door locks just in case we need to come
[00:49:41.780 --> 00:49:43.020]   in your house.
[00:49:43.020 --> 00:49:44.020]   Right.
[00:49:44.020 --> 00:49:45.020]   Right.
[00:49:45.020 --> 00:49:46.020]   Right.
[00:49:46.020 --> 00:49:47.020]   But it'll be only only for your own protection.
[00:49:47.020 --> 00:49:48.020]   Well, okay.
[00:49:48.020 --> 00:49:49.180]   But there is an analog there.
[00:49:49.180 --> 00:49:54.220]   You know, if you have a gate here in this area, a lot of people in the farm areas have
[00:49:54.220 --> 00:49:58.940]   a gate before you can get in and they have a special key that the fire department, it's
[00:49:58.940 --> 00:50:02.660]   a special key the fire department can open because if your house is burning down, you
[00:50:02.660 --> 00:50:06.700]   don't want the fire trucks to have to stop at the gate or drive them down.
[00:50:06.700 --> 00:50:07.700]   So there's an analog for that.
[00:50:07.700 --> 00:50:14.020]   The TSA, TSA approved locks, keep bad guys out, but the TSA has a way of opening them.
[00:50:14.020 --> 00:50:17.940]   So there's a precedent.
[00:50:17.940 --> 00:50:23.900]   Corey points out, first of all, if you put a backdoor in any kind of software that not
[00:50:23.900 --> 00:50:29.380]   just not only makes it easy for law enforcement, but criminals, lawyers and foreign spies.
[00:50:29.380 --> 00:50:34.140]   So you've made all communications insecure.
[00:50:34.140 --> 00:50:37.460]   Any firms, this is what Cameron's proposing when Corey breaks it down.
[00:50:37.460 --> 00:50:42.420]   Any firms within reach of the UK government must be banned from producing secure software.
[00:50:42.420 --> 00:50:44.780]   That includes Microsoft and Apple.
[00:50:44.780 --> 00:50:49.500]   All major code repositories, GitHub and source forage, for example, have to be blocked because
[00:50:49.500 --> 00:50:55.660]   that's where you get the open source for programs like tech secure and others, true
[00:50:55.660 --> 00:51:00.820]   crypt to get prevent that search engines must not answer queries about web pages that carry
[00:51:00.820 --> 00:51:03.460]   secure software.
[00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:05.220]   I raised this point yesterday with Steve.
[00:51:05.220 --> 00:51:12.100]   It also means that you have to have a backdoor in secure HTTP HTTPS SSL.
[00:51:12.100 --> 00:51:17.380]   That's not an easy thing to do since that's essentially open.
[00:51:17.380 --> 00:51:21.820]   Virtually all academic security work in the UK must cease security research must only take
[00:51:21.820 --> 00:51:26.060]   place in proprietary research environments where there is no onus to publish one's findings
[00:51:26.060 --> 00:51:28.860]   such as industry R&D and security services.
[00:51:28.860 --> 00:51:33.460]   All packets in and out of the country and within the country must be subject to Chinese-style
[00:51:33.460 --> 00:51:34.700]   deep packet inspection.
[00:51:34.700 --> 00:51:35.700]   We're just talking about that.
[00:51:35.700 --> 00:51:40.340]   I'm sure Sandvine has a tool and any packets that appear to originate from secure software
[00:51:40.340 --> 00:51:43.260]   must be dropped.
[00:51:43.260 --> 00:51:48.860]   Existing walled gardens like iOS and Xboxes must be ordered to ban their users from installing
[00:51:48.860 --> 00:51:51.060]   secure software.
[00:51:51.060 --> 00:51:54.380]   Unvisiting the country from abroad must have their smartphones held at the border until
[00:51:54.380 --> 00:51:57.900]   they leave.
[00:51:57.900 --> 00:52:01.700]   For proprietary operating system vendors like Microsoft and Apple must be ordered to redesign
[00:52:01.700 --> 00:52:06.020]   their operating systems as walled gardens that only allow users to run software from an app
[00:52:06.020 --> 00:52:10.100]   store which will not sell or give secure software to Britons.
[00:52:10.100 --> 00:52:13.580]   Free and open source operating systems that power the energy, banking, e-commerce and
[00:52:13.580 --> 00:52:19.500]   infrastructure sectors must be banned outright.
[00:52:19.500 --> 00:52:24.780]   So that's why Steve was upset and a lot of people are upset about this.
[00:52:24.780 --> 00:52:27.180]   I think it's pretty clear it's unenforceable.
[00:52:27.180 --> 00:52:36.220]   And even if it wasn't enforceable, it wouldn't achieve what it's supposedly going to achieve
[00:52:36.220 --> 00:52:37.860]   or wants to achieve.
[00:52:37.860 --> 00:52:41.660]   You criminalize security software, only criminals will have secured.
[00:52:41.660 --> 00:52:47.980]   But what it indicates is a belief that there is a manifest destiny and a right for government
[00:52:47.980 --> 00:52:51.100]   to be able to listen to anything we set.
[00:52:51.100 --> 00:52:52.260]   And that's the real issue.
[00:52:52.260 --> 00:52:53.820]   That's what this reveals.
[00:52:53.820 --> 00:52:54.820]   I agree.
[00:52:54.820 --> 00:52:56.260]   It's telling into their state of mind.
[00:52:56.260 --> 00:53:02.460]   Well, and unfortunately in Britain at least and in lots of other European countries, it's
[00:53:02.460 --> 00:53:04.780]   taken for granted that the government has those rights.
[00:53:04.780 --> 00:53:10.260]   I think US is abnormal in a way in the sense that people won't put up with that kind of
[00:53:10.260 --> 00:53:11.260]   stuff.
[00:53:11.260 --> 00:53:12.260]   Here's the...
[00:53:12.260 --> 00:53:15.980]   And that's the sad thing is that he's blaming the attacks on Charlotte.
[00:53:15.980 --> 00:53:20.900]   He's saying, "Well, after the attacks on Charlie Hebdo in France, we've got to do this."
[00:53:20.900 --> 00:53:23.100]   Which makes no sense at all.
[00:53:23.100 --> 00:53:24.100]   But that's what happened in the US.
[00:53:24.100 --> 00:53:26.540]   As soon as 9/11 happened, we had the Patriot Act.
[00:53:26.540 --> 00:53:28.220]   That's the kind of knee-jerk reaction.
[00:53:28.220 --> 00:53:33.260]   Here's a Prime Minister Cameron speaking after an ad.
[00:53:33.260 --> 00:53:36.740]   How come there's an ad before the Prime Minister speaks?
[00:53:36.740 --> 00:53:40.300]   Apparently, people who are having erectile dysfunction.
[00:53:40.300 --> 00:53:41.300]   Or maybe...
[00:53:41.300 --> 00:53:43.820]   That's actually the Prime Minister.
[00:53:43.820 --> 00:53:44.820]   I'm sorry.
[00:53:44.820 --> 00:53:46.820]   No, it's a Charles Schwab.
[00:53:46.820 --> 00:53:51.420]   The first duty of any government is to keep our country and our people safe.
[00:53:51.420 --> 00:53:52.420]   The attacks...
[00:53:52.420 --> 00:53:53.220]   How much has been used?
[00:53:53.220 --> 00:53:55.180]   Is that the first duty of any government?
[00:53:55.180 --> 00:53:56.180]   No.
[00:53:56.180 --> 00:53:59.500]   It's to give us this to protect our freedom indeed.
[00:53:59.500 --> 00:54:04.060]   But how much tyranny has been wrought under that justification?
[00:54:04.060 --> 00:54:08.340]   And as Corey points out, it would not keep us safe.
[00:54:08.340 --> 00:54:13.860]   It would open all communications to bad guys, spies, and Corey points out, "Voyers."
[00:54:13.860 --> 00:54:19.460]   Paris once again demonstrated the scale of the terrorist threat that we face and the
[00:54:19.460 --> 00:54:25.860]   need to have robust powers through our intelligence and security agencies and policing in order
[00:54:25.860 --> 00:54:27.620]   to keep our people safe.
[00:54:27.620 --> 00:54:33.300]   And the powers that I believe we need, whether on communications data or on the content of
[00:54:33.300 --> 00:54:38.220]   communications, I'm very comfortable that those are absolutely right for a modern,
[00:54:38.220 --> 00:54:39.220]   liberal democracy.
[00:54:39.220 --> 00:54:44.060]   But what I've done is, as you know, we legislated very recently...
[00:54:44.060 --> 00:54:46.060]   So what are we going to have here, isn't it?
[00:54:46.060 --> 00:54:51.980]   It's totally the opposite of what should be allowed in all the world.
[00:54:51.980 --> 00:54:53.980]   Somebody's pointing on the chatroom and this is true also.
[00:54:53.980 --> 00:54:54.980]   The Cameron's faced with...
[00:54:54.980 --> 00:54:59.860]   I don't know how significant, but somewhat of a challenge from the right-wing UKIP.
[00:54:59.860 --> 00:55:01.500]   The UKIP, yeah.
[00:55:01.500 --> 00:55:06.740]   And that this may be merely a political statement that he knows has no chance of passing through
[00:55:06.740 --> 00:55:07.740]   Parliament.
[00:55:07.740 --> 00:55:10.980]   I think he is trying to savor rattle and look tough.
[00:55:10.980 --> 00:55:15.020]   He's not known for being tough and this is a great opportunity.
[00:55:15.020 --> 00:55:16.780]   Oh, look at all the terrorists.
[00:55:16.780 --> 00:55:17.780]   Yeah.
[00:55:17.780 --> 00:55:19.060]   But look at the justifications we have.
[00:55:19.060 --> 00:55:26.140]   In France, there has been, since the Charlie Hebdo murders, there have been, I think, 54 examples
[00:55:26.140 --> 00:55:29.580]   of people being arrested for supporting terrorism.
[00:55:29.580 --> 00:55:35.300]   Now after a loud and clear support of free speech, then what turns around?
[00:55:35.300 --> 00:55:38.180]   We turn around and we abuse free speech.
[00:55:38.180 --> 00:55:43.340]   In the American view, you support even obnoxious speech to support speech.
[00:55:43.340 --> 00:55:44.340]   Right?
[00:55:44.340 --> 00:55:45.340]   The other problem was all...
[00:55:45.340 --> 00:55:49.780]   There have been great reports to Guardian and elsewhere of all of the heads of state
[00:55:49.780 --> 00:55:55.940]   who marched alongside Hollande, who are terrible things to free speech.
[00:55:55.940 --> 00:55:56.940]   I know.
[00:55:56.940 --> 00:56:01.020]   It was really ironic to watch that parade of dictators.
[00:56:01.020 --> 00:56:05.140]   France themselves just finished arresting someone for something.
[00:56:05.140 --> 00:56:06.140]   That's what we're saying.
[00:56:06.140 --> 00:56:07.540]   54 cases of that.
[00:56:07.540 --> 00:56:15.140]   They arrested a comedian, a well-known but radical comedian in France, because he posted on Facebook
[00:56:15.140 --> 00:56:17.940]   something that they didn't like.
[00:56:17.940 --> 00:56:20.380]   Right after saying, we have to uphold free speech.
[00:56:20.380 --> 00:56:24.460]   There's no free speech if you don't say what we agree with.
[00:56:24.460 --> 00:56:25.460]   Right.
[00:56:25.460 --> 00:56:27.100]   That's really a case.
[00:56:27.100 --> 00:56:32.380]   I don't want to go off the reservation here.
[00:56:32.380 --> 00:56:37.500]   That's one of the shocks to me in the aftermath of the Charlie Hebdo case is that when I talk
[00:56:37.500 --> 00:56:41.020]   about free speech, what I get back often is, "Oh, you're American.
[00:56:41.020 --> 00:56:43.500]   You have a different view."
[00:56:43.500 --> 00:56:44.500]   I wrote about this.
[00:56:44.500 --> 00:56:48.340]   That free speech is weirdly oddly American.
[00:56:48.340 --> 00:56:51.020]   No, it's not peculiarly American.
[00:56:51.020 --> 00:56:53.180]   It is a human right.
[00:56:53.180 --> 00:56:55.540]   Unless we see it that way.
[00:56:55.540 --> 00:56:56.540]   Right.
[00:56:56.540 --> 00:57:03.100]   But the protection of it and the explicit protection of it is unusual to the US.
[00:57:03.100 --> 00:57:06.500]   In many countries, other things take precedent.
[00:57:06.500 --> 00:57:07.500]   Security.
[00:57:07.500 --> 00:57:08.500]   Sure.
[00:57:08.500 --> 00:57:11.020]   But I think that's right.
[00:57:11.020 --> 00:57:12.020]   Yeah.
[00:57:12.020 --> 00:57:16.780]   I think there's a lack of understanding of what free speech means.
[00:57:16.780 --> 00:57:19.180]   That really struck me after this case.
[00:57:19.180 --> 00:57:23.340]   By the way, I also took to task American journalists and newspapers for not publishing
[00:57:23.340 --> 00:57:24.340]   the cartoons.
[00:57:24.340 --> 00:57:25.780]   I understand, be clear here.
[00:57:25.780 --> 00:57:29.620]   I understand why the Jewish Chronicle didn't publish them.
[00:57:29.620 --> 00:57:35.380]   But Margaret Sullivan, the public editor of The New York Times, first time she attacked
[00:57:35.380 --> 00:57:37.700]   the issue, she danced around.
[00:57:37.700 --> 00:57:41.980]   But today she came straight out and said, "The New York Times was wrong not to run the
[00:57:41.980 --> 00:57:45.980]   current new cover of Charlie Hebdo."
[00:57:45.980 --> 00:57:52.660]   That it's not offensive by any standard of civility and it should be there.
[00:57:52.660 --> 00:57:56.660]   American newspapers don't really understand, I think, to some extent, that free speech
[00:57:56.660 --> 00:58:00.620]   is not just a right for journalism, it's responsibility.
[00:58:00.620 --> 00:58:07.620]   Well, and this comes up whenever I write about free speech, especially when I'm talking
[00:58:07.620 --> 00:58:15.140]   about proprietary platforms like Twitter and Facebook that are effectively corporate-owned
[00:58:15.140 --> 00:58:16.660]   kind of town squares.
[00:58:16.660 --> 00:58:21.060]   Someone will say, "Well, free speech only applies to government.
[00:58:21.060 --> 00:58:24.980]   The First Amendment is only designed to apply to government."
[00:58:24.980 --> 00:58:32.500]   Free speech is a fiction unless it applies to how government treats citizens, which doesn't
[00:58:32.500 --> 00:58:33.660]   make any sense to me at all.
[00:58:33.660 --> 00:58:37.820]   The whole reason why there's a First Amendment is that it's a principle.
[00:58:37.820 --> 00:58:41.020]   Well, I'll argue that case.
[00:58:41.020 --> 00:58:47.140]   No, the reason that is that part of your free speech is as an editor.
[00:58:47.140 --> 00:58:48.460]   Part of Leo has free speech.
[00:58:48.460 --> 00:58:50.660]   Leo can say, Jarvis, "I just don't like you.
[00:58:50.660 --> 00:58:54.300]   I've had it with you, fed up with you and your damn Chromebook.
[00:58:54.300 --> 00:58:56.420]   Get off my ear."
[00:58:56.420 --> 00:58:58.780]   And he has a perfect right to do that.
[00:58:58.780 --> 00:58:59.780]   That is part of his...
[00:58:59.780 --> 00:59:02.060]   I'm not the government.
[00:59:02.060 --> 00:59:08.220]   But the government can't tell me to stop extolling the virtues of Chromebooks.
[00:59:08.220 --> 00:59:10.220]   It's not the government's rule.
[00:59:10.220 --> 00:59:16.340]   But Leo, of course, has a private company, has a full and complete right to decide what
[00:59:16.340 --> 00:59:20.620]   speech it chooses to distribute, and that's not censorship.
[00:59:20.620 --> 00:59:21.620]   Sure, it does.
[00:59:21.620 --> 00:59:27.420]   And my only point when I wrote about Facebook was Mark Zuckerberg made a point of standing
[00:59:27.420 --> 00:59:35.980]   up in favor of free speech and against censorship and said he stood behind all of those principles
[00:59:35.980 --> 00:59:40.820]   despite the fact that Facebook routinely censors things for no reason or for reasons
[00:59:40.820 --> 00:59:41.820]   it doesn't discuss.
[00:59:41.820 --> 00:59:44.100]   I'm not saying they don't have the right to do that.
[00:59:44.100 --> 00:59:46.780]   I'm just saying you can't have it both ways.
[00:59:46.780 --> 00:59:47.780]   You can't say that you're...
[00:59:47.780 --> 00:59:48.780]   Well, no, I think you can.
[00:59:48.780 --> 00:59:49.780]   I think you can.
[00:59:49.780 --> 00:59:53.220]   You set your standards because otherwise what we'd have...
[00:59:53.220 --> 00:59:58.500]   And this is why we have Section 230 in the US is that if it were a binary switch, we
[00:59:58.500 --> 01:00:02.380]   would have no forms and no discussion in the US because if you were held responsible,
[01:00:02.380 --> 01:00:08.100]   as for example, Europeans are, for the things that occur on your site or the things that
[01:00:08.100 --> 01:00:11.700]   you link to, then you would have no discussion.
[01:00:11.700 --> 01:00:17.220]   So Section 230 protects us from making our own judgments so that we can make our own
[01:00:17.220 --> 01:00:18.220]   judgments.
[01:00:18.220 --> 01:00:19.500]   We can let things go up that we disapprove of.
[01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:21.260]   We can take things down.
[01:00:21.260 --> 01:00:22.260]   That's our freedom.
[01:00:22.260 --> 01:00:23.460]   No, I have to disagree with you there.
[01:00:23.460 --> 01:00:24.460]   I think that there...
[01:00:24.460 --> 01:00:26.660]   Right, but Section 230 protects them.
[01:00:26.660 --> 01:00:32.260]   If Section 230 protects them, then why do they take so much stuff down?
[01:00:32.260 --> 01:00:33.260]   Because...
[01:00:33.260 --> 01:00:34.660]   Well, we'll get another way.
[01:00:34.660 --> 01:00:35.660]   Forget the Facebook.
[01:00:35.660 --> 01:00:40.380]   Let's say that the comments on my blog.
[01:00:40.380 --> 01:00:45.740]   I take down things there that are offensive and stupid and off target and abusive.
[01:00:45.740 --> 01:00:49.700]   And that is not only my right, but I believe my responsibility to have a good community
[01:00:49.700 --> 01:00:50.700]   there.
[01:00:50.700 --> 01:00:57.260]   If you believe that all speech is equal, all speech must be allowed, it's allowed by government.
[01:00:57.260 --> 01:01:02.260]   But that doesn't mean that I should be forced to be the host for it.
[01:01:02.260 --> 01:01:03.260]   It's not inconsistent.
[01:01:03.260 --> 01:01:04.260]   It's not inconsistent.
[01:01:04.260 --> 01:01:05.260]   It's not inconsistent.
[01:01:05.260 --> 01:01:11.580]   It's not inconsistent for you to support censorship on Facebook and be against government censorship.
[01:01:11.580 --> 01:01:12.580]   That's not inconsistent.
[01:01:12.580 --> 01:01:13.580]   That's not censorship.
[01:01:13.580 --> 01:01:14.580]   That's not censorship, Leo.
[01:01:14.580 --> 01:01:15.580]   Or what else?
[01:01:15.580 --> 01:01:16.580]   Well, you could call it censorship.
[01:01:16.580 --> 01:01:17.580]   It's censorship.
[01:01:17.580 --> 01:01:18.580]   Let's say it's censorship.
[01:01:18.580 --> 01:01:19.580]   censorship is when no.
[01:01:19.580 --> 01:01:21.580]   Censorship is when government censures you from something.
[01:01:21.580 --> 01:01:22.580]   I'm willing to broaden.
[01:01:22.580 --> 01:01:25.520]   I'm willing to agree with Matthew to broaden it and say censorship is censorship and it
[01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:30.060]   just cutting something off your site for whatever reason is a form of censorship.
[01:01:30.060 --> 01:01:36.540]   But it's still not inconsistent to say I have the right to do that as a private business,
[01:01:36.540 --> 01:01:37.860]   and we should all fight against it.
[01:01:37.860 --> 01:01:39.100]   It's the government doing that.
[01:01:39.100 --> 01:01:40.100]   Yes.
[01:01:40.100 --> 01:01:41.100]   That's not inconsistent.
[01:01:41.100 --> 01:01:44.780]   It's not inconsistent for Mark Zuckerberg to say, "Yeah, of course, we have to control
[01:01:44.780 --> 01:01:49.260]   the environment on Facebook, but I don't want the government arresting somebody because
[01:01:49.260 --> 01:01:52.340]   they say something that the government disagrees with."
[01:01:52.340 --> 01:01:54.700]   That's not inconsistent.
[01:01:54.700 --> 01:02:00.860]   But the fact is that Facebook and Twitter are used by governments to censor.
[01:02:00.860 --> 01:02:03.140]   They are actively censoring people on behalf of them.
[01:02:03.140 --> 01:02:08.060]   They also say, Matthew, in that case, they also say they always say that they must follow
[01:02:08.060 --> 01:02:09.060]   local laws.
[01:02:09.060 --> 01:02:12.060]   Now Twitter, or does it more cleverly?
[01:02:12.060 --> 01:02:13.060]   Twitter does it more cleverly.
[01:02:13.060 --> 01:02:17.340]   It will cut out something in France and leave it in the rest of the world.
[01:02:17.340 --> 01:02:19.540]   It's a French government that's being taken down.
[01:02:19.540 --> 01:02:20.540]   Not just that.
[01:02:20.540 --> 01:02:23.100]   They actually fight requests in court on behalf of the users.
[01:02:23.100 --> 01:02:28.900]   They fight, and in some cases they have put content back that they took away because the
[01:02:28.900 --> 01:02:33.180]   government of whatever country didn't make a good enough case.
[01:02:33.180 --> 01:02:36.980]   Facebook, so you were talking about a couple of times.
[01:02:36.980 --> 01:02:39.940]   One is when they are an agent of government.
[01:02:39.940 --> 01:02:43.540]   When a agent with government says, "You must take this down under law," and they do that
[01:02:43.540 --> 01:02:45.500]   because they follow the law.
[01:02:45.500 --> 01:02:48.100]   You favor it if they don't like it, and they may fight it, but they lose and they take it
[01:02:48.100 --> 01:02:49.100]   down.
[01:02:49.100 --> 01:02:50.100]   That's one thing.
[01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:51.620]   It's another thing when they choose to take something down on their own.
[01:02:51.620 --> 01:02:58.260]   Twitter was indeed a very, very open platform, but Twitter hit the wall with two things recently.
[01:02:58.260 --> 01:02:59.900]   We talked about this in the show a while ago.
[01:02:59.900 --> 01:03:05.500]   One was the beheading videos, and two was the naked celebrity photos that have been stolen.
[01:03:05.500 --> 01:03:10.420]   Twitter decided basically for the first time really to say, "Okay, that's going too far.
[01:03:10.420 --> 01:03:17.340]   We are making an editorial judgment to take that down on our own without request.
[01:03:17.340 --> 01:03:19.340]   That's their right to do."
[01:03:19.340 --> 01:03:27.340]   Look, Google does not take down videos that criticize Turkey from YouTube because there's
[01:03:27.340 --> 01:03:30.860]   a law in Turkey against criticizing Turkish net.
[01:03:30.860 --> 01:03:31.860]   No, they don't.
[01:03:31.860 --> 01:03:32.860]   Yes, you be it.
[01:03:32.860 --> 01:03:37.180]   Because they get blocked from Turkey because they make a choice to leave that comment up.
[01:03:37.180 --> 01:03:42.900]   Because YouTube is blocked in Turkey, and they've chosen to go that way.
[01:03:42.900 --> 01:03:43.900]   Right.
[01:03:43.900 --> 01:03:49.420]   I'm saying at some point, a company has to decide whether they are just going to roll
[01:03:49.420 --> 01:03:55.060]   over for every government request or whether there are things they are not going to do
[01:03:55.060 --> 01:03:56.060]   when asked by government.
[01:03:56.060 --> 01:03:57.060]   Exactly.
[01:03:57.060 --> 01:03:58.060]   Right.
[01:03:58.060 --> 01:03:59.060]   Okay.
[01:03:59.060 --> 01:04:00.060]   We agree there, yes.
[01:04:00.060 --> 01:04:01.060]   So, Google of us got out of China.
[01:04:01.060 --> 01:04:02.060]   Right.
[01:04:02.060 --> 01:04:08.300]   But are you suggesting that every company should pull out of every country where the government
[01:04:08.300 --> 01:04:10.540]   demands they do something they can't do?
[01:04:10.540 --> 01:04:11.540]   That's the...
[01:04:11.540 --> 01:04:12.540]   Yeah.
[01:04:12.540 --> 01:04:14.860]   That's the idea of doctrine.
[01:04:14.860 --> 01:04:19.660]   I think you have to punish these countries for having that kind of reactionary point of
[01:04:19.660 --> 01:04:20.660]   view.
[01:04:20.660 --> 01:04:24.900]   And if these companies did, the countries would soon turn around, I think.
[01:04:24.900 --> 01:04:25.900]   Yeah.
[01:04:25.900 --> 01:04:28.780]   Well, come on the right to be forgotten that Google should pull out of Europe.
[01:04:28.780 --> 01:04:29.780]   I agree.
[01:04:29.780 --> 01:04:30.780]   What?
[01:04:30.780 --> 01:04:31.780]   Look at that.
[01:04:31.780 --> 01:04:32.780]   Googled in Spain.
[01:04:32.780 --> 01:04:33.780]   YouTube a number of times, even though...
[01:04:33.780 --> 01:04:36.500]   So, they'll punish them and block them, and then they put them back on again.
[01:04:36.500 --> 01:04:41.500]   I just think if Facebook has principles, which it sounds like they do, then they should
[01:04:41.500 --> 01:04:45.700]   stick to them instead of bending over for every government that asks them to take something
[01:04:45.700 --> 01:04:46.700]   down.
[01:04:46.700 --> 01:04:47.700]   I agree.
[01:04:47.700 --> 01:04:48.700]   I sympathize with your view.
[01:04:48.700 --> 01:04:49.700]   Yeah.
[01:04:49.700 --> 01:04:52.900]   But they fight, but it's not as simple as that.
[01:04:52.900 --> 01:04:54.100]   Well, I'll tell you why it's not.
[01:04:54.100 --> 01:04:55.100]   They're publicly held...
[01:04:55.100 --> 01:04:59.620]   They're publicly held companies, and they have a fiduciary right to their stakeholders
[01:04:59.620 --> 01:05:01.500]   to maximize profits.
[01:05:01.500 --> 01:05:06.540]   And it's hard in that environment to take a principled stand, I think.
[01:05:06.540 --> 01:05:09.100]   If it's a privately held company, they should do it.
[01:05:09.100 --> 01:05:10.100]   But it's...
[01:05:10.100 --> 01:05:11.100]   I will...
[01:05:11.100 --> 01:05:15.860]   I'm not going down a rat hole here, but someone recently pointed out to me that companies
[01:05:15.860 --> 01:05:20.500]   do not actually have a legal fiduciary duty to maximize profits.
[01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:21.500]   They don't?
[01:05:21.500 --> 01:05:22.500]   No.
[01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:23.500]   There is no...
[01:05:23.500 --> 01:05:26.300]   No, not a legal duty, but the shareholders could punish them.
[01:05:26.300 --> 01:05:27.300]   Sure.
[01:05:27.300 --> 01:05:29.700]   They could punish their shareholders like everybody out.
[01:05:29.700 --> 01:05:30.700]   But they don't have any legal...
[01:05:30.700 --> 01:05:31.700]   They could punish them...
[01:05:31.700 --> 01:05:32.700]   Yeah, it's the myth.
[01:05:32.700 --> 01:05:33.700]   You're right.
[01:05:33.700 --> 01:05:34.700]   Of course you agree.
[01:05:34.700 --> 01:05:38.420]   Any company, public or not, has the right to lose money and run a crappy business.
[01:05:38.420 --> 01:05:39.420]   I'd also like always...
[01:05:39.420 --> 01:05:41.420]   I've protected it from that.
[01:05:41.420 --> 01:05:44.860]   Mark Zuckerberg controls the majority of the votes.
[01:05:44.860 --> 01:05:45.860]   True.
[01:05:45.860 --> 01:05:47.500]   Voting shares in Facebook and...
[01:05:47.500 --> 01:05:49.180]   So he faced no risk.
[01:05:49.180 --> 01:05:50.180]   He can do whatever he wants.
[01:05:50.180 --> 01:05:51.180]   He faced no risk.
[01:05:51.180 --> 01:05:52.700]   What do you say Zuckerberg should do?
[01:05:52.700 --> 01:05:53.700]   Be specific.
[01:05:53.700 --> 01:05:55.500]   Should Facebook pull out of 20 countries?
[01:05:55.500 --> 01:05:58.740]   Should they pull out of every country that doesn't have a first amendment?
[01:05:58.740 --> 01:06:01.900]   I would like to see Facebook put up a bit more of a fight.
[01:06:01.900 --> 01:06:03.100]   That's what I would like to see.
[01:06:03.100 --> 01:06:05.900]   You think Twitter is a good model for this fight?
[01:06:05.900 --> 01:06:06.900]   Twitter puts out a fight.
[01:06:06.900 --> 01:06:07.900]   Twitter is a better model.
[01:06:07.900 --> 01:06:11.340]   I think you're presuming that Facebook doesn't fight.
[01:06:11.340 --> 01:06:13.300]   Facebook also has a transparency report.
[01:06:13.300 --> 01:06:14.420]   Google has a transparency report.
[01:06:14.420 --> 01:06:15.420]   They all fight.
[01:06:15.420 --> 01:06:17.180]   Twitter does more and more cleverly.
[01:06:17.180 --> 01:06:19.540]   But Twitter does other things that are odd.
[01:06:19.540 --> 01:06:21.540]   But I think Twitter is a lot more...
[01:06:21.540 --> 01:06:25.180]   Some of the fighting from some of the companies looks like window dressing.
[01:06:25.180 --> 01:06:29.340]   Facebook does not say in its transparency report, I don't think specifically what the
[01:06:29.340 --> 01:06:31.420]   complaint is or what content it involves.
[01:06:31.420 --> 01:06:32.420]   They can't!
[01:06:32.420 --> 01:06:33.420]   It says...
[01:06:33.420 --> 01:06:34.420]   They're not allowed to.
[01:06:34.420 --> 01:06:35.420]   They can't.
[01:06:35.420 --> 01:06:36.420]   Look, Google doesn't either.
[01:06:36.420 --> 01:06:41.680]   Google says they get between one and nine hundred requests from government and that was
[01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:43.380]   after fighting.
[01:06:43.380 --> 01:06:48.020]   Twitter will tell you what the order was, what it related to.
[01:06:48.020 --> 01:06:49.340]   No, not in a lot of cases.
[01:06:49.340 --> 01:06:50.340]   Not in a lot of cases.
[01:06:50.340 --> 01:06:51.340]   They cannot, Matthew.
[01:06:51.340 --> 01:06:52.340]   They'd be jailed.
[01:06:52.340 --> 01:06:53.340]   They can't.
[01:06:53.340 --> 01:06:56.540]   They can't in cases where the US government has asked them for data.
[01:06:56.540 --> 01:06:58.580]   If it's a national security letter, they have to shut up.
[01:06:58.580 --> 01:07:02.620]   But if the Turkish government files a court order saying, "Take down that thing because
[01:07:02.620 --> 01:07:06.180]   it makes fun of Kamal, how to Turk," they can certainly say that.
[01:07:06.180 --> 01:07:07.180]   And they don't.
[01:07:07.180 --> 01:07:11.180]   We're going to take a break.
[01:07:11.180 --> 01:07:12.180]   Good timing.
[01:07:12.180 --> 01:07:13.180]   When we come back...
[01:07:13.180 --> 01:07:14.180]   I got to put my box and gloves on.
[01:07:14.180 --> 01:07:16.180]   No, this is a great topic and I'm glad we had the conversation.
[01:07:16.180 --> 01:07:25.100]   When we come back, we'll talk a little bit about the change.
[01:07:25.100 --> 01:07:26.460]   The change is from Google.
[01:07:26.460 --> 01:07:29.780]   Not the change law because no one can do the change law like Gina Travani.
[01:07:29.780 --> 01:07:33.460]   But there are some new things from Google we want to talk a little bit about.
[01:07:33.460 --> 01:07:38.100]   But first, a word from our friends at SmartThings.
[01:07:38.100 --> 01:07:41.500]   SmartThings had a great showing at CES this year.
[01:07:41.500 --> 01:07:49.620]   In fact, Time Magazine said SmartThings gave them their 2015 Editors Choice Award.
[01:07:49.620 --> 01:07:51.820]   SmartThings is a kind of a neat story.
[01:07:51.820 --> 01:07:52.820]   There you go.
[01:07:52.820 --> 01:07:56.980]   Six of the coolest smart home innovations at CES.
[01:07:56.980 --> 01:07:57.980]   SmartThings right in there.
[01:07:57.980 --> 01:08:02.700]   And it's a great story because it was a Kickstarter project by some guys who said, "We need to
[01:08:02.700 --> 01:08:08.260]   solve this problem of this tower of Babel among home automation systems."
[01:08:08.260 --> 01:08:10.340]   There's Z-Wave and Zigbee.
[01:08:10.340 --> 01:08:13.940]   There's X10 and Nest.
[01:08:13.940 --> 01:08:15.100]   Nest doesn't talk to anybody.
[01:08:15.100 --> 01:08:18.180]   So why don't we make something to talk to everybody?
[01:08:18.180 --> 01:08:22.740]   They raised a lot of money and they created a great product, the SmartThings Smart Hub.
[01:08:22.740 --> 01:08:24.180]   And they're getting better all the time.
[01:08:24.180 --> 01:08:26.020]   It talks to everything.
[01:08:26.020 --> 01:08:32.340]   Your Sonos, music, your Hue lights, your Nest thermostat, your Dropcam camera.
[01:08:32.340 --> 01:08:35.020]   It talks to all of the SmartThings devices as well.
[01:08:35.020 --> 01:08:39.300]   In fact, to make this easy, they've created these solution kits and home security kits
[01:08:39.300 --> 01:08:44.500]   that give you everything you need to solve a particular problem.
[01:08:44.500 --> 01:08:47.580]   But now, by the way, it's a great starting point because they all have the hub like the
[01:08:47.580 --> 01:08:55.220]   Energy Saver Kit for 179.10 that saves you money by controlling how much energy you use,
[01:08:55.220 --> 01:08:59.860]   allowing you smartphone access to all the information, but your lights, your locks, your
[01:08:59.860 --> 01:09:03.740]   thermostats, your home security can all use that same app.
[01:09:03.740 --> 01:09:07.700]   Yes, it is awesome for iOS, for Android, and for Windows phone.
[01:09:07.700 --> 01:09:10.260]   I think a lot of Windows phone users feel a little left out.
[01:09:10.260 --> 01:09:12.780]   You don't have to do SmartThings supports you too.
[01:09:12.780 --> 01:09:14.700]   Now you could type good tap, good night on your phone.
[01:09:14.700 --> 01:09:15.700]   The lights turn off.
[01:09:15.700 --> 01:09:17.100]   The thermostat turns down.
[01:09:17.100 --> 01:09:18.660]   The doors lock.
[01:09:18.660 --> 01:09:20.940]   Garage doors close.
[01:09:20.940 --> 01:09:23.700]   Set your lamps to brighten each morning at sunrise or when you want to wake up.
[01:09:23.700 --> 01:09:26.460]   Even keep your thing, you're home protected with SmartThings.
[01:09:26.460 --> 01:09:30.820]   Home security, motion detection, water detection, and more.
[01:09:30.820 --> 01:09:33.100]   You can even have your speakers bark.
[01:09:33.100 --> 01:09:37.460]   You can have dogs barking if there's motion outside the house.
[01:09:37.460 --> 01:09:38.460]   Really?
[01:09:38.460 --> 01:09:39.460]   Yeah.
[01:09:39.460 --> 01:09:40.460]   How cool?
[01:09:40.460 --> 01:09:42.260]   I know.
[01:09:42.260 --> 01:09:46.860]   Your doors will recognize when you're close and unlock themselves as you walk up.
[01:09:46.860 --> 01:09:51.180]   SmartThings is really cool and it gets you started setting up your smart home right now.
[01:09:51.180 --> 01:09:57.100]   SmartThings is offering Twig users 10% off any home security or solution kit and free shipping
[01:09:57.100 --> 01:10:03.320]   in the US, but you have to go to smartthings.com/twit and use our offer code TwitTAN at checkout
[01:10:03.320 --> 01:10:08.860]   smartthings.com/twit.
[01:10:08.860 --> 01:10:16.660]   Your minutes away from a smart home with smart things.
[01:10:16.660 --> 01:10:17.660]   Don't play the trumpets.
[01:10:17.660 --> 01:10:20.260]   We're just going to talk our way through the Google.
[01:10:20.260 --> 01:10:29.340]   I haven't gotten it yet, but Google is pushing out to all Android devices and iOS too.
[01:10:29.340 --> 01:10:31.060]   A better Google translate.
[01:10:31.060 --> 01:10:32.860]   I love this idea.
[01:10:32.860 --> 01:10:33.860]   I got it.
[01:10:33.860 --> 01:10:34.860]   Did you get it?
[01:10:34.860 --> 01:10:35.860]   Have you tried it?
[01:10:35.860 --> 01:10:36.860]   I didn't try it.
[01:10:36.860 --> 01:10:37.860]   Let's see.
[01:10:37.860 --> 01:10:38.940]   So they bought WordLens a while ago.
[01:10:38.940 --> 01:10:42.900]   That was the really cool iOS app that would let you see it's right there.
[01:10:42.900 --> 01:10:46.180]   Show a sign in a language you don't understand and it will translate it.
[01:10:46.180 --> 01:10:54.300]   It even preserves the font and translates it into your language, which is very awesome.
[01:10:54.300 --> 01:11:02.020]   You can snap a photo to a text to get a translation for it in 36 languages.
[01:11:02.020 --> 01:11:05.780]   The instant translation that you're seeing with WordLens works from English to French,
[01:11:05.780 --> 01:11:08.580]   German, Italian, Portuguese, Russian and Spanish.
[01:11:08.580 --> 01:11:10.780]   They're going to add more languages in time.
[01:11:10.780 --> 01:11:12.100]   They do real-time voice too.
[01:11:12.100 --> 01:11:13.100]   This is really cool.
[01:11:13.100 --> 01:11:14.100]   Should we try it?
[01:11:14.100 --> 01:11:15.100]   Should we try it?
[01:11:15.100 --> 01:11:16.100]   Here we go.
[01:11:16.100 --> 01:11:17.100]   It's a language.
[01:11:17.100 --> 01:11:18.100]   Who speaks a language?
[01:11:18.100 --> 01:11:19.100]   Say something in German.
[01:11:19.100 --> 01:11:21.100]   Where is the train station?
[01:11:21.100 --> 01:11:24.100]   Who is the battle?
[01:11:24.100 --> 01:11:26.100]   Hear that?
[01:11:26.100 --> 01:11:27.100]   Yeah.
[01:11:27.100 --> 01:11:30.100]   Now you have to respond in German.
[01:11:30.100 --> 01:11:34.100]   It's just a carada house.
[01:11:34.100 --> 01:11:38.100]   It is straight ahead.
[01:11:38.100 --> 01:11:39.340]   Whoa!
[01:11:39.340 --> 01:11:41.380]   So the idea is they've sped it up.
[01:11:41.380 --> 01:11:44.740]   First of all, the first time you have to press a button.
[01:11:44.740 --> 01:11:46.780]   You tap the mic, you start speaking.
[01:11:46.780 --> 01:11:50.980]   It immediately recognizes what language you're speaking, which is nice.
[01:11:50.980 --> 01:11:54.180]   And then it goes back and forth much more quickly without you having to do anything.
[01:11:54.180 --> 01:11:56.380]   So you talk, they talk, you talk, they talk.
[01:11:56.380 --> 01:11:57.620]   Here's a demonstration.
[01:11:57.620 --> 01:11:58.620]   G'Day?
[01:11:58.620 --> 01:11:59.620]   Hello.
[01:11:59.620 --> 01:12:03.500]   How can I help you?
[01:12:03.500 --> 01:12:04.500]   Good morning.
[01:12:04.500 --> 01:12:06.500]   I would like a cup of coffee.
[01:12:06.500 --> 01:12:10.500]   Bonjour, je vous d'etcheis.
[01:12:10.500 --> 01:12:12.300]   Without milk or sugar?
[01:12:12.300 --> 01:12:16.300]   It's all in, you cook.
[01:12:16.300 --> 01:12:18.300]   That was very quick.
[01:12:18.300 --> 01:12:19.300]   It's like a...
[01:12:19.300 --> 01:12:20.300]   Oh, okay.
[01:12:20.300 --> 01:12:21.300]   But here's the thing.
[01:12:21.300 --> 01:12:22.780]   I just turn it on its side.
[01:12:22.780 --> 01:12:23.940]   So I do it.
[01:12:23.940 --> 01:12:25.340]   Let me translate.
[01:12:25.340 --> 01:12:29.860]   So English to German.
[01:12:29.860 --> 01:12:31.860]   I would like a cup of coffee.
[01:12:31.860 --> 01:12:38.020]   Yet again, I'm the tuss of coffee.
[01:12:38.020 --> 01:12:41.020]   Mückjens, you made it?
[01:12:41.020 --> 01:12:43.700]   You want to milk?
[01:12:43.700 --> 01:12:44.700]   Wow.
[01:12:44.700 --> 01:12:47.620]   No, thank you.
[01:12:47.620 --> 01:12:48.620]   Just sugar.
[01:12:48.620 --> 01:12:53.780]   9, 10, no, it's so good.
[01:12:53.780 --> 01:12:54.780]   That's pretty neat.
[01:12:54.780 --> 01:12:56.540]   That's the Babel fish.
[01:12:56.540 --> 01:12:57.540]   Exactly.
[01:12:57.540 --> 01:12:58.540]   And it's instant.
[01:12:58.540 --> 01:12:59.540]   Gross or kind?
[01:12:59.540 --> 01:13:00.540]   Big and small.
[01:13:00.540 --> 01:13:01.540]   I'm water-rung.
[01:13:01.540 --> 01:13:02.540]   Now, obviously, it's...
[01:13:02.540 --> 01:13:05.540]   What I'm doing is turning the foam between each one.
[01:13:05.540 --> 01:13:06.540]   So I talk up right now.
[01:13:06.540 --> 01:13:07.540]   Oh, is that how you do it?
[01:13:07.540 --> 01:13:08.540]   Oh, okay.
[01:13:08.540 --> 01:13:09.540]   You walk up right now.
[01:13:09.540 --> 01:13:10.540]   Oh, is that how you do it?
[01:13:10.540 --> 01:13:11.540]   Oh, okay.
[01:13:11.540 --> 01:13:12.540]   He walks this way.
[01:13:12.540 --> 01:13:13.820]   So you just go back and forth.
[01:13:13.820 --> 01:13:15.380]   That's how it knows who's talking.
[01:13:15.380 --> 01:13:17.940]   I could have used that when I was in Italy.
[01:13:17.940 --> 01:13:23.820]   I got a ride from the train station with a guy who didn't speak any English at all,
[01:13:23.820 --> 01:13:24.820]   other than hello.
[01:13:24.820 --> 01:13:27.820]   And so I said, "Where are we going?"
[01:13:27.820 --> 01:13:30.020]   And he said, "I..."
[01:13:30.020 --> 01:13:31.900]   Right?
[01:13:31.900 --> 01:13:32.900]   To Isis.
[01:13:32.900 --> 01:13:35.980]   I mean, even a little bit...
[01:13:35.980 --> 01:13:39.820]   You know, however, mangled or grammatically incorrect it is better than nothing.
[01:13:39.820 --> 01:13:43.660]   I mean, would you be embarrassed to use it?
[01:13:43.660 --> 01:13:45.500]   Would you feel like a weirdo using it?
[01:13:45.500 --> 01:13:48.380]   No, I think everywhere except France.
[01:13:48.380 --> 01:13:50.340]   And France, they just spit at you.
[01:13:50.340 --> 01:13:51.340]   Yeah, they would tell you.
[01:13:51.340 --> 01:13:54.220]   Well, right now, everybody loves France, so I'm making no French jokes.
[01:13:54.220 --> 01:13:55.220]   Let's be very clear.
[01:13:55.220 --> 01:13:56.220]   Actually, it's been my experience.
[01:13:56.220 --> 01:13:58.220]   If you make the attempt in France, they're very kind.
[01:13:58.220 --> 01:13:59.220]   Yeah, they're great.
[01:13:59.220 --> 01:14:00.220]   Well, that's what I wonder.
[01:14:00.220 --> 01:14:01.220]   Would they think this is cheating?
[01:14:01.220 --> 01:14:05.940]   Well, I would say, start a conversation and then go, "Oh, pardon me."
[01:14:05.940 --> 01:14:08.020]   Don't say it.
[01:14:08.020 --> 01:14:11.580]   But my mobile does.
[01:14:11.580 --> 01:14:12.580]   And then, you know what?
[01:14:12.580 --> 01:14:14.620]   That might be kind of cool.
[01:14:14.620 --> 01:14:15.620]   I'm going to try it.
[01:14:15.620 --> 01:14:17.540]   I'm going to Europe in June.
[01:14:17.540 --> 01:14:18.540]   Going to Netherlands.
[01:14:18.540 --> 01:14:19.540]   I don't speak Dutch.
[01:14:19.540 --> 01:14:22.020]   Germany, don't speak German.
[01:14:22.020 --> 01:14:23.540]   And Austria.
[01:14:23.540 --> 01:14:25.700]   And oh, I'm also going to Istanbul.
[01:14:25.700 --> 01:14:26.700]   Don't speak...
[01:14:26.700 --> 01:14:27.700]   Oh.
[01:14:27.700 --> 01:14:28.700]   Hungarian.
[01:14:28.700 --> 01:14:29.700]   I think that's what...
[01:14:29.700 --> 01:14:31.180]   Well, this is really cool.
[01:14:31.180 --> 01:14:32.180]   I remember when...
[01:14:32.180 --> 01:14:33.180]   I remember when...
[01:14:33.180 --> 01:14:38.180]   Eric Schmidt showed it at Davos like four years ago saying, "This will stop war."
[01:14:38.180 --> 01:14:40.620]   Well, I don't know about that.
[01:14:40.620 --> 01:14:42.820]   My start a war, actually.
[01:14:42.820 --> 01:14:48.220]   Well, what I want to do is put the picture part of this over the Charlie Hebdo covers
[01:14:48.220 --> 01:14:50.380]   and see if it can translate Charlie Hebdo.
[01:14:50.380 --> 01:14:52.460]   Good idea.
[01:14:52.460 --> 01:14:54.580]   This is interesting from the Google blog post about this.
[01:14:54.580 --> 01:14:56.140]   By the way, it would be Android and iOS.
[01:14:56.140 --> 01:14:58.620]   And some of these features have never been available before on iOS.
[01:14:58.620 --> 01:15:01.500]   So if you're an iOS user, definitely try it.
[01:15:01.500 --> 01:15:03.460]   This is the stat from the blog post.
[01:15:03.460 --> 01:15:07.100]   Half a billion people use Google Translate every month.
[01:15:07.100 --> 01:15:09.500]   More than a billion translations a day.
[01:15:09.500 --> 01:15:10.500]   Jesus.
[01:15:10.500 --> 01:15:12.220]   It's kind of mind-boggling.
[01:15:12.220 --> 01:15:14.740]   So people do use this, obviously.
[01:15:14.740 --> 01:15:16.420]   I would guess a lot of it is on the web.
[01:15:16.420 --> 01:15:17.900]   I've used it a lot where you...
[01:15:17.900 --> 01:15:21.260]   Either you're reading a web page that says translate this page, you do that.
[01:15:21.260 --> 01:15:22.260]   That's probably the...
[01:15:22.260 --> 01:15:23.260]   Or a snippet.
[01:15:23.260 --> 01:15:24.260]   Or a snippet.
[01:15:24.260 --> 01:15:25.260]   Yeah, that's probably the majority usage.
[01:15:25.260 --> 01:15:26.260]   But still...
[01:15:26.260 --> 01:15:29.380]   And I remember when they added the ability to recognize the language automatically.
[01:15:29.380 --> 01:15:31.020]   So you didn't have to choose from a doctor drop down?
[01:15:31.020 --> 01:15:32.340]   Yeah, isn't that great?
[01:15:32.340 --> 01:15:33.340]   Super handy.
[01:15:33.340 --> 01:15:34.500]   Well, why shouldn't it?
[01:15:34.500 --> 01:15:38.780]   When I mentioned the Google Translate this morning on Twitter, someone said they wouldn't
[01:15:38.780 --> 01:15:43.900]   be impressed until it translated from Tamari and the Star Trek language that is solely
[01:15:43.900 --> 01:15:44.900]   metaphor driven.
[01:15:44.900 --> 01:15:46.460]   No, that's not going to work.
[01:15:46.460 --> 01:15:47.460]   Star Mach and Jalot.
[01:15:47.460 --> 01:15:48.460]   Yeah.
[01:15:48.460 --> 01:15:49.460]   That's not going to work.
[01:15:49.460 --> 01:15:50.460]   Ever.
[01:15:50.460 --> 01:15:51.460]   Ever.
[01:15:51.460 --> 01:15:54.260]   All right, moving on with the change log.
[01:15:54.260 --> 01:15:56.300]   You left the photo part out.
[01:15:56.300 --> 01:15:58.060]   No, I mentioned Word Lens.
[01:15:58.060 --> 01:15:59.060]   We shared that.
[01:15:59.060 --> 01:16:00.060]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:16:00.060 --> 01:16:03.300]   Google Domains has launched.
[01:16:03.300 --> 01:16:06.140]   This was beta only for a while.
[01:16:06.140 --> 01:16:11.580]   But it's now here if you go to domains.google.com.
[01:16:11.580 --> 01:16:14.660]   It still says beta, but you can register a domain name.
[01:16:14.660 --> 01:16:20.700]   They have hundreds of TLDs, $12 a year, which is kind of in there with a going price.
[01:16:20.700 --> 01:16:29.580]   It automatically works instantly with blog spot, but it also works with Shopify Squarespace,
[01:16:29.580 --> 01:16:31.780]   Webley and Wix.
[01:16:31.780 --> 01:16:35.300]   So you just use their software and you're automatically in there.
[01:16:35.300 --> 01:16:36.300]   I don't know.
[01:16:36.300 --> 01:16:37.300]   Let's see.
[01:16:37.300 --> 01:16:38.300]   What should we get?
[01:16:38.300 --> 01:16:40.140]   What domain name should we get here?
[01:16:40.140 --> 01:16:41.940]   It's got a domain management feature.
[01:16:41.940 --> 01:16:45.380]   It's very much like any registrar.
[01:16:45.380 --> 01:16:49.940]   We like Hover because they're good Canadian fellas and gals.
[01:16:49.940 --> 01:16:53.980]   But I don't know.
[01:16:53.980 --> 01:16:55.500]   I need a new, what do I need?
[01:16:55.500 --> 01:16:57.060]   Chris, give me a domain name.
[01:16:57.060 --> 01:16:58.420]   You need a new domain name.
[01:16:58.420 --> 01:17:02.820]   What about Minecraft today?
[01:17:02.820 --> 01:17:05.220]   That's going to be your name of your new show, Chris.
[01:17:05.220 --> 01:17:08.340]   Minecraft, no, I'm just kidding.
[01:17:08.340 --> 01:17:10.900]   Never doing another Minecraft show again.
[01:17:10.900 --> 01:17:14.100]   It's about, that's Minecraft fat is about to end, isn't it?
[01:17:14.100 --> 01:17:15.100]   Domain availability?
[01:17:15.100 --> 01:17:19.660]   Yes, I can get minecrafttoday.com, minecrafttoday.net, minecrafttoday.org.
[01:17:19.660 --> 01:17:21.180]   Dot company, dot partners.
[01:17:21.180 --> 01:17:22.700]   There's quite a few choices.
[01:17:22.700 --> 01:17:24.980]   Look at that.
[01:17:24.980 --> 01:17:26.540]   Dot today.
[01:17:26.540 --> 01:17:30.180]   Did I get minecrafttoday.today?
[01:17:30.180 --> 01:17:31.180]   And then minecraftnow?
[01:17:31.180 --> 01:17:32.180]   Minecrafttoday.net.
[01:17:32.180 --> 01:17:33.180]   Look at these.
[01:17:33.180 --> 01:17:35.900]   And then they're just making up stuff.
[01:17:35.900 --> 01:17:41.020]   Videogametoday.org, modtoday.net, YouTube.
[01:17:41.020 --> 01:17:43.660]   Good today.
[01:17:43.660 --> 01:17:45.300]   YouTube again.
[01:17:45.300 --> 01:17:46.300]   Good today.
[01:17:46.300 --> 01:17:49.420]   What the hell is that?
[01:17:49.420 --> 01:17:50.420]   Mine art today.
[01:17:50.420 --> 01:17:52.060]   Great Britain today.
[01:17:52.060 --> 01:17:53.060]   I don't know.
[01:17:53.060 --> 01:17:54.060]   Twittertoday.org.
[01:17:54.060 --> 01:17:55.700]   Alright, Twittertoday.org.
[01:17:55.700 --> 01:17:57.820]   It's got to be worth something.
[01:17:57.820 --> 01:18:00.140]   I can't search because I'm in Canada.
[01:18:00.140 --> 01:18:01.740]   Oh, it's US only?
[01:18:01.740 --> 01:18:03.740]   Not entitled.
[01:18:03.740 --> 01:18:04.740]   What do you want?
[01:18:04.740 --> 01:18:05.740]   You want dot ninja?
[01:18:05.740 --> 01:18:06.740]   This week in Google?
[01:18:06.740 --> 01:18:07.740]   Alright.
[01:18:07.740 --> 01:18:08.740]   This.
[01:18:08.740 --> 01:18:09.740]   Yeah, let's see what we can get with this week.
[01:18:09.740 --> 01:18:11.860]   Actually, I probably don't know if that search works.
[01:18:11.860 --> 01:18:13.700]   That looks like a regular Google search.
[01:18:13.700 --> 01:18:15.260]   Oh, now I'm lost.
[01:18:15.260 --> 01:18:17.860]   You know, they say we got to teach these guys usability.
[01:18:17.860 --> 01:18:22.180]   I'm going to go back to the original.
[01:18:22.180 --> 01:18:23.180]   Domains.google.com.
[01:18:23.180 --> 01:18:27.620]   I'm not sure why Google wants to be in this business, but it makes more sense than the
[01:18:27.620 --> 01:18:30.540]   insurance business, which they apparently also want to be in.
[01:18:30.540 --> 01:18:33.700]   I don't understand the whole domain thing.
[01:18:33.700 --> 01:18:34.980]   I mean, I don't know.
[01:18:34.980 --> 01:18:36.780]   Maybe domainers or a big market.
[01:18:36.780 --> 01:18:37.980]   I can't imagine.
[01:18:37.980 --> 01:18:39.260]   Well, go to Eddie's made some money.
[01:18:39.260 --> 01:18:40.260]   I can't imagine.
[01:18:40.260 --> 01:18:41.860]   Look, this week in Google.com.
[01:18:41.860 --> 01:18:44.100]   No, somebody's got that.
[01:18:44.100 --> 01:18:47.860]   But.net.org.company.training.
[01:18:47.860 --> 01:18:48.860]   Madmen Twitter.com.
[01:18:48.860 --> 01:18:52.740]   I don't know where they get that from.
[01:18:52.740 --> 01:18:54.060]   Now they're just making crap up.
[01:18:54.060 --> 01:18:55.060]   Madmen website.
[01:18:55.060 --> 01:18:57.660]   Did I mention Madmen?
[01:18:57.660 --> 01:19:00.700]   All right, there you go.
[01:19:00.700 --> 01:19:02.780]   Domains.google.com.
[01:19:02.780 --> 01:19:04.900]   That's another new thing.
[01:19:04.900 --> 01:19:07.420]   They checked your birth certificate information.
[01:19:07.420 --> 01:19:08.820]   That's why they suggested Madmen.
[01:19:08.820 --> 01:19:10.060]   Oh, is that it?
[01:19:10.060 --> 01:19:14.500]   They know you must have been born in the 50s.
[01:19:14.500 --> 01:19:22.700]   Google and, of course, and GoDaddy is probably the largest of the rest of the registrars.
[01:19:22.700 --> 01:19:27.980]   Google was, I can't accredit it in 2005.
[01:19:27.980 --> 01:19:28.980]   Oh.
[01:19:28.980 --> 01:19:31.180]   So they could have done this for a while.
[01:19:31.180 --> 01:19:32.180]   Well.
[01:19:32.180 --> 01:19:34.180]   They might have done it internally.
[01:19:34.180 --> 01:19:39.460]   Well, remember, they locked up a bunch of those extensions.
[01:19:39.460 --> 01:19:40.460]   Right.
[01:19:40.460 --> 01:19:42.780]   And I still don't know why.
[01:19:42.780 --> 01:19:43.780]   But.
[01:19:43.780 --> 01:19:45.260]   I got blog.
[01:19:45.260 --> 01:19:50.420]   Well, because maybe they want to sell them on, you know, domains.google.com.
[01:19:50.420 --> 01:19:52.220]   Well, you know, here's a doc.
[01:19:52.220 --> 01:19:53.860]   Google, right?
[01:19:53.860 --> 01:19:54.860]   Yes.
[01:19:54.860 --> 01:19:55.860]   Yes.
[01:19:55.860 --> 01:20:03.860]   And if they never sell it, it just seems a bit odd to me that they own an entire subdomain.
[01:20:03.860 --> 01:20:04.860]   Yeah.
[01:20:04.860 --> 01:20:05.860]   Subdomain.
[01:20:05.860 --> 01:20:06.860]   Me too.
[01:20:06.860 --> 01:20:08.620]   They did say they were going to open a bunch of them.
[01:20:08.620 --> 01:20:09.860]   I don't know if that ever happened.
[01:20:09.860 --> 01:20:13.540]   But they said, like, top log and a bunch of those they were going to open up so they
[01:20:13.540 --> 01:20:14.540]   wouldn't control.
[01:20:14.540 --> 01:20:20.380]   If you have a subdomain, it should be required to be open or don't have it.
[01:20:20.380 --> 01:20:26.500]   And I would hope that Google wouldn't in any way prioritize and search the domains you
[01:20:26.500 --> 01:20:28.340]   purchase on the Google domain set.
[01:20:28.340 --> 01:20:29.340]   But I'm sure they wouldn't.
[01:20:29.340 --> 01:20:30.340]   That's ridiculous.
[01:20:30.340 --> 01:20:31.340]   For the 12 bucks a year.
[01:20:31.340 --> 01:20:32.340]   Yeah.
[01:20:32.340 --> 01:20:36.020]   We're going to throw out our entire business model for 12 bucks a year for one person for
[01:20:36.020 --> 01:20:37.580]   domain that's absurd.
[01:20:37.580 --> 01:20:38.580]   Moving on, Google.
[01:20:38.580 --> 01:20:39.580]   Go ahead.
[01:20:39.580 --> 01:20:44.060]   Sorry, I should point out, Blackberry came out and said that it is not in talks with Samsung
[01:20:44.060 --> 01:20:45.540]   and the stock drop.
[01:20:45.540 --> 01:20:46.540]   Well, of course.
[01:20:46.540 --> 01:20:48.860]   The stock went right back down.
[01:20:48.860 --> 01:20:49.860]   That's a strip down.
[01:20:49.860 --> 01:20:50.860]   Oh, well.
[01:20:50.860 --> 01:20:52.500]   We've seen this.
[01:20:52.500 --> 01:20:56.620]   I mean, if you do a search for Google for a Blackberry Samsung, you'll find references
[01:20:56.620 --> 01:20:58.940]   to an acquisition or merger since 2012.
[01:20:58.940 --> 01:20:59.940]   It's been going on.
[01:20:59.940 --> 01:21:02.500]   You've had a bunch of traders made some money today, though.
[01:21:02.500 --> 01:21:05.460]   Yeah, you know, that's how you make some money.
[01:21:05.460 --> 01:21:07.980]   That's a very clever idea.
[01:21:07.980 --> 01:21:15.620]   Google's rolling out a classroom mobile app for students and teachers saying, of course,
[01:21:15.620 --> 01:21:22.060]   if the dog has actually eaten your homework, classroom cannot help, but never.
[01:21:22.060 --> 01:21:30.660]   This is the classroom we talked about about six months ago, but this is the mobile version.
[01:21:30.660 --> 01:21:32.140]   Here's the promo clip.
[01:21:32.140 --> 01:21:35.300]   Google classroom mobile app snap a photo.
[01:21:35.300 --> 01:21:42.060]   So there you're doing a chemistry lab and you've got to callers and smoke.
[01:21:42.060 --> 01:21:43.420]   You say, take a photo.
[01:21:43.420 --> 01:21:49.340]   This is in Google apps, experiment photo, chemistry 101 done.
[01:21:49.340 --> 01:21:54.740]   I don't know what you got out of that that you couldn't do otherwise, but there you go.
[01:21:54.740 --> 01:21:55.740]   Well, yeah.
[01:21:55.740 --> 01:22:00.980]   That's I know I'm going off to change whatever we call it now, but Google going into the
[01:22:00.980 --> 01:22:05.380]   classroom with that kind of app and Facebook announcing Facebook for work.
[01:22:05.380 --> 01:22:06.940]   It's really interesting to me that they're taking these.
[01:22:06.940 --> 01:22:09.980]   They're trying to take basic functionality.
[01:22:09.980 --> 01:22:14.060]   They already exist that you can use for anything you don't want, whether it's work or school
[01:22:14.060 --> 01:22:16.860]   and then try to declare it work or school.
[01:22:16.860 --> 01:22:21.060]   I'm not sure what they how much they have to add to make that true.
[01:22:21.060 --> 01:22:25.540]   Well, I think for school, certainly there are privacy issues that you have to be aware
[01:22:25.540 --> 01:22:28.820]   of kids under 13, their special rules on the web, etc, etc.
[01:22:28.820 --> 01:22:32.940]   So that makes sense that you, you know, and this is a big category that's not very well
[01:22:32.940 --> 01:22:37.180]   served, you know, commercial products like Blackboard and open source products like Moodle
[01:22:37.180 --> 01:22:39.620]   are kind of not great.
[01:22:39.620 --> 01:22:42.260]   And I think Google probably looked at it and said we could do better.
[01:22:42.260 --> 01:22:48.660]   And a lot of the stuff in that market has been proprietary way more proprietary than
[01:22:48.660 --> 01:22:54.100]   Google to the point where you have to get locked in, you know, sap style to something
[01:22:54.100 --> 01:22:58.420]   that then your kid can't get any of their data out and the teacher can't share with
[01:22:58.420 --> 01:23:00.140]   teachers who use a different system.
[01:23:00.140 --> 01:23:02.540]   I'd love to see Google open some of that up.
[01:23:02.540 --> 01:23:08.780]   Our local elementary school uses G apps and all the kids get Chromebooks.
[01:23:08.780 --> 01:23:09.780]   Really?
[01:23:09.780 --> 01:23:13.600]   Yeah, the local high school that I'm on the board of, even though they're giving Mac
[01:23:13.600 --> 01:23:18.340]   books in their one to one program, they're absolutely using Google apps, Google mail,
[01:23:18.340 --> 01:23:19.340]   everything Google.
[01:23:19.340 --> 01:23:20.340]   My wife.
[01:23:20.340 --> 01:23:21.340]   Go ahead, Jason.
[01:23:21.340 --> 01:23:26.300]   I was going to say my wife and I are touring preschools right now or sorry, not preschools,
[01:23:26.300 --> 01:23:29.260]   kindergarten through six, right, so through eight.
[01:23:29.260 --> 01:23:32.700]   And I mean, as early as I think like fourth grade, they're giving them Chromebooks.
[01:23:32.700 --> 01:23:33.700]   Really?
[01:23:33.700 --> 01:23:34.700]   Yeah, I think that's.
[01:23:34.700 --> 01:23:38.420]   I have visions of leo, I have visions actually the Leo staying outside the school laughing
[01:23:38.420 --> 01:23:39.420]   at the kids.
[01:23:39.420 --> 01:23:41.420]   No, no, I have come around.
[01:23:41.420 --> 01:23:42.420]   I've come around.
[01:23:42.420 --> 01:23:43.420]   I think it's great.
[01:23:43.420 --> 01:23:44.420]   I love it.
[01:23:44.420 --> 01:23:45.420]   I know you have.
[01:23:45.420 --> 01:23:50.820]   It's a, and I always said this is good for a school or anywhere where you want to constrain
[01:23:50.820 --> 01:23:51.820]   what people can do.
[01:23:51.820 --> 01:23:52.820]   I've always said that.
[01:23:52.820 --> 01:23:58.060]   I mean, in fact, we talked about this was on the rundown two weeks ago or whatever.
[01:23:58.060 --> 01:24:00.060]   The LA school district course had done.
[01:24:00.060 --> 01:24:01.060]   Yes.
[01:24:01.060 --> 01:24:02.060]   iPads.
[01:24:02.060 --> 01:24:03.060]   Yes.
[01:24:03.060 --> 01:24:04.060]   And that was an utter disaster.
[01:24:04.060 --> 01:24:08.500]   And so there's which in the Chromebooks also because of corruption, it turns out there
[01:24:08.500 --> 01:24:13.060]   might have been that bid process might not as fair as one thinks.
[01:24:13.060 --> 01:24:19.500]   I went into my daughter's classroom and the teacher had brought in her old computer from
[01:24:19.500 --> 01:24:20.740]   like six years ago.
[01:24:20.740 --> 01:24:22.300]   And that's what they had in the classroom.
[01:24:22.300 --> 01:24:23.300]   Yeah.
[01:24:23.300 --> 01:24:24.300]   Yeah.
[01:24:24.300 --> 01:24:25.300]   That's very common.
[01:24:25.300 --> 01:24:26.300]   Correct myself.
[01:24:26.300 --> 01:24:27.300]   Yes, I did mean some domains.
[01:24:27.300 --> 01:24:29.340]   I'm a TLD is top level domains.
[01:24:29.340 --> 01:24:30.340]   Thank you.
[01:24:30.340 --> 01:24:31.340]   We knew what you meant.
[01:24:31.340 --> 01:24:33.340]   Oh, God, I even noticed.
[01:24:33.340 --> 01:24:40.340]   I said, I said, if you use iOS, which you don't, you might want to try this Chrome remote
[01:24:40.340 --> 01:24:41.340]   desktop for iOS.
[01:24:41.340 --> 01:24:43.100]   They must have it for Android already, right?
[01:24:43.100 --> 01:24:44.100]   They do.
[01:24:44.100 --> 01:24:45.100]   Yeah.
[01:24:45.100 --> 01:24:46.500]   I just installed it last night on my iPad actually.
[01:24:46.500 --> 01:24:47.500]   So it allows you.
[01:24:47.500 --> 01:24:48.500]   It's got a ridiculous.
[01:24:48.500 --> 01:24:52.500]   Why do you need because you can have what all your stuff anywhere?
[01:24:52.500 --> 01:24:53.500]   Right.
[01:24:53.500 --> 01:24:55.860]   Why do you need a remote desktop to a Chrome device?
[01:24:55.860 --> 01:24:58.380]   Well, yeah, I actually use it.
[01:24:58.380 --> 01:25:05.820]   This might seem like a weird use case, but if I'm downstairs and I have stuff on the computer
[01:25:05.820 --> 01:25:12.220]   upstairs, I've actually looked at it on the iPad to remind myself what was going on.
[01:25:12.220 --> 01:25:16.940]   Like to try and return to the state of mind I had what when I was looking at that computer
[01:25:16.940 --> 01:25:21.060]   or to reboot something or restart something.
[01:25:21.060 --> 01:25:22.060]   You know what?
[01:25:22.060 --> 01:25:23.060]   It just makes it easier.
[01:25:23.060 --> 01:25:24.420]   Everything's more fluid.
[01:25:24.420 --> 01:25:25.420]   And it is really easy.
[01:25:25.420 --> 01:25:33.180]   I've used remote desktop apps for decades, VNC and all sorts of proprietary.
[01:25:33.180 --> 01:25:35.660]   This was super slick on every device.
[01:25:35.660 --> 01:25:40.100]   So you start by adding a Chrome extension, the Chrome Remote Desktop app, they call it
[01:25:40.100 --> 01:25:42.820]   now, and you enable remote access.
[01:25:42.820 --> 01:25:45.700]   You give it a PIN so only you can get to it.
[01:25:45.700 --> 01:25:46.700]   Yeah.
[01:25:46.700 --> 01:25:50.860]   And then you launch the app on iOS or Android and it sees it on your network and says,
[01:25:50.860 --> 01:25:52.660]   "Oh, which one would you like to join?"
[01:25:52.660 --> 01:25:57.380]   And you can say, "Don't ask me for a PIN anymore on this device."
[01:25:57.380 --> 01:25:58.380]   Nice.
[01:25:58.380 --> 01:25:59.580]   And it was fast.
[01:25:59.580 --> 01:26:00.580]   Yeah.
[01:26:00.580 --> 01:26:02.460]   I'm definitely doing this.
[01:26:02.460 --> 01:26:04.020]   I don't know why, but I am.
[01:26:04.020 --> 01:26:05.780]   Because it's cool.
[01:26:05.780 --> 01:26:06.780]   It's just there.
[01:26:06.780 --> 01:26:07.780]   It's cool.
[01:26:07.780 --> 01:26:13.260]   Now, if I install the Chrome extension on any one of my crumbs, it installs across the
[01:26:13.260 --> 01:26:15.460]   board too, which is kind of nice.
[01:26:15.460 --> 01:26:16.460]   Yep.
[01:26:16.460 --> 01:26:17.460]   Yep.
[01:26:17.460 --> 01:26:18.460]   All right.
[01:26:18.460 --> 01:26:19.460]   Thank you.
[01:26:19.460 --> 01:26:20.460]   Thank you.
[01:26:20.460 --> 01:26:22.380]   Oh, my overlord Google.
[01:26:22.380 --> 01:26:25.460]   Once again, convincing me of the value.
[01:26:25.460 --> 01:26:29.460]   I was actually thinking of getting my mom a Chromebook and then just run Chrome Remote
[01:26:29.460 --> 01:26:30.460]   Desktop on that.
[01:26:30.460 --> 01:26:32.940]   Oh, oh, clever.
[01:26:32.940 --> 01:26:34.260]   So you could fix it and stuff.
[01:26:34.260 --> 01:26:35.260]   Can you do it over the network?
[01:26:35.260 --> 01:26:36.700]   No, you have to be on the LAN.
[01:26:36.700 --> 01:26:37.700]   You do?
[01:26:37.700 --> 01:26:38.700]   Oh, I don't know.
[01:26:38.700 --> 01:26:40.700]   I don't think so.
[01:26:40.700 --> 01:26:42.700]   Oh, well, maybe you do.
[01:26:42.700 --> 01:26:43.700]   Hmm.
[01:26:43.700 --> 01:26:46.180]   Well, a lot of remote desktops you can do over a network.
[01:26:46.180 --> 01:26:48.220]   And someone in the chat room figure out whether that's true.
[01:26:48.220 --> 01:26:49.940]   Would you figure that out, chat room?
[01:26:49.940 --> 01:26:50.940]   We're confused.
[01:26:50.940 --> 01:26:52.340]   Can you get back to me?
[01:26:52.340 --> 01:26:57.260]   Project era, which I've mocked because I don't feel like anybody really wants a modular smartphone
[01:26:57.260 --> 01:27:00.780]   that you could take like a part like a tinker toy.
[01:27:00.780 --> 01:27:04.060]   But it's going to begin pilot testing in Puerto Rico later this year.
[01:27:04.060 --> 01:27:08.020]   This was kind of a skunkworks project in that was part of Motorola.
[01:27:08.020 --> 01:27:12.740]   Google kept it when they sold Motorola to Lenovo.
[01:27:12.740 --> 01:27:19.260]   Right now, as we speak, the second Project era developers conferences going on.
[01:27:19.260 --> 01:27:26.140]   And this will give you a roadmap of how and when the modular smartphones will get in
[01:27:26.140 --> 01:27:27.140]   the market.
[01:27:27.140 --> 01:27:31.620]   I did something like someone about this is appealing to me.
[01:27:31.620 --> 01:27:33.780]   Oh, it's cool.
[01:27:33.780 --> 01:27:36.900]   But I really I feel like I don't want to carry around a phone that's going to fall apart
[01:27:36.900 --> 01:27:38.820]   as I'm walking around.
[01:27:38.820 --> 01:27:40.820]   Little modules are going to shed off of it.
[01:27:40.820 --> 01:27:43.980]   Oh, man, I dropped my speaker module.
[01:27:43.980 --> 01:27:46.580]   The light vision, you can look through people's clothes.
[01:27:46.580 --> 01:27:47.580]   Yeah, I don't know.
[01:27:47.580 --> 01:27:54.460]   Puerto Rico, open mobile and Claro will, I guess, are they going to sell it like a smartphone?
[01:27:54.460 --> 01:27:56.500]   It'd be easier at top grade, right?
[01:27:56.500 --> 01:27:58.060]   And you could just upgrade modules.
[01:27:58.060 --> 01:27:59.060]   Right.
[01:27:59.060 --> 01:28:00.380]   That's the key.
[01:28:00.380 --> 01:28:04.500]   But look how ugly your phone is.
[01:28:04.500 --> 01:28:07.420]   This is an ugly ass phone.
[01:28:07.420 --> 01:28:08.740]   We've had it's not new.
[01:28:08.740 --> 01:28:13.500]   Remember the life spring modules for the right, right?
[01:28:13.500 --> 01:28:15.820]   The life spring palm.
[01:28:15.820 --> 01:28:17.740]   Anyway, you know what?
[01:28:17.740 --> 01:28:19.100]   It might be very cool.
[01:28:19.100 --> 01:28:20.100]   I don't know.
[01:28:20.100 --> 01:28:21.100]   Palm is coming back.
[01:28:21.100 --> 01:28:23.540]   When you can buy one, you will, Leo.
[01:28:23.540 --> 01:28:24.900]   Oh, I'll buy one.
[01:28:24.900 --> 01:28:30.140]   But I don't know if it'll ever be my major, main phone.
[01:28:30.140 --> 01:28:34.340]   Here's Dita Brown from the Verge looking at it.
[01:28:34.340 --> 01:28:37.780]   You know, this guy's a designer because he's wearing eyeglasses with white phones.
[01:28:37.780 --> 01:28:40.180]   And he has no hair.
[01:28:40.180 --> 01:28:41.780]   That's the designer giveaway.
[01:28:41.780 --> 01:28:44.420]   If he had a scarf, we'd know he was definitely.
[01:28:44.420 --> 01:28:46.260]   I think you look good with white glasses, Leo.
[01:28:46.260 --> 01:28:49.020]   I'm going to get white glasses to go with my white hair.
[01:28:49.020 --> 01:28:52.820]   A group that in some part came out of DARPA is essentially making the instructions.
[01:28:52.820 --> 01:28:56.140]   It's kind of an interesting idea.
[01:28:56.140 --> 01:28:58.940]   So we had a hand-spring did that, didn't it?
[01:28:58.940 --> 01:28:59.940]   Hand-spring.
[01:28:59.940 --> 01:29:00.940]   That's what it was.
[01:29:00.940 --> 01:29:01.940]   That's a life spring.
[01:29:01.940 --> 01:29:02.940]   Hand-spring modules.
[01:29:02.940 --> 01:29:05.460]   I have a hand-spring over here.
[01:29:05.460 --> 01:29:07.780]   You could add a modem.
[01:29:07.780 --> 01:29:11.220]   You could add, it was really a palm pilot.
[01:29:11.220 --> 01:29:14.260]   You could add a phone to, but only one at a time.
[01:29:14.260 --> 01:29:20.180]   So this one you can kind of plug and play it all together.
[01:29:20.180 --> 01:29:21.740]   If you want, there's a live stream.
[01:29:21.740 --> 01:29:26.660]   If you go to projectera.com, you can watch the live stream of the dev conference.
[01:29:26.660 --> 01:29:29.820]   And a new MDK has been released.
[01:29:29.820 --> 01:29:31.540]   So if you want to get developing, you can.
[01:29:31.540 --> 01:29:35.140]   I think open hardware is a very interesting category.
[01:29:35.140 --> 01:29:37.820]   I'm not again.
[01:29:37.820 --> 01:29:40.180]   Let's see.
[01:29:40.180 --> 01:29:42.660]   Oh, Facebook, it worked.
[01:29:42.660 --> 01:29:45.460]   You brought this up.
[01:29:45.460 --> 01:29:47.460]   I had an insight.
[01:29:47.460 --> 01:29:48.860]   Yeah, me.
[01:29:48.860 --> 01:29:50.260]   I love those moments.
[01:29:50.260 --> 01:29:52.780]   I had an insight.
[01:29:52.780 --> 01:29:56.500]   I was thinking about this because this was on Windows Weekly.
[01:29:56.500 --> 01:29:57.940]   We were talking about it.
[01:29:57.940 --> 01:30:04.940]   Just as the iPhone really changed enterprise computing because of bring your own device.
[01:30:04.940 --> 01:30:09.100]   Employees started saying, "No, I'm not going to use that crappy blackberry or Windows phone
[01:30:09.100 --> 01:30:10.100]   you issued me.
[01:30:10.100 --> 01:30:12.620]   I'm going to use my own iPhone and I'm going to bring it into the end."
[01:30:12.620 --> 01:30:13.620]   It was a great enterprise.
[01:30:13.620 --> 01:30:19.980]   It forced IT managers and CIOs to even acknowledge that it existed and then embrace it.
[01:30:19.980 --> 01:30:22.700]   And now iPhones and iPads are everywhere in enterprise.
[01:30:22.700 --> 01:30:25.740]   And I have to think Mark Zuckerberg is thinking, "Hey, BYOD.
[01:30:25.740 --> 01:30:27.900]   What about BYOS?"
[01:30:27.900 --> 01:30:30.060]   Users are used to using Facebook.
[01:30:30.060 --> 01:30:31.540]   They love Facebook.
[01:30:31.540 --> 01:30:35.260]   They probably already are using Facebook a little bit for business communications.
[01:30:35.260 --> 01:30:41.380]   What if we made a business-specific version of Facebook that in effect is a leverage or
[01:30:42.380 --> 01:30:43.580]   wedge into enterprise?
[01:30:43.580 --> 01:30:45.060]   Yeah, that's good point.
[01:30:45.060 --> 01:30:48.260]   Because people want to use what they use.
[01:30:48.260 --> 01:30:53.220]   They don't want to use some special HipChat or whatever they want to use what they use.
[01:30:53.220 --> 01:30:58.220]   Now, interestingly, there's no messaging in Facebook for work, so you still need HipChat.
[01:30:58.220 --> 01:31:01.220]   That makes sense to me.
[01:31:01.220 --> 01:31:05.940]   And also, what they said is, "Well, we've been dog-fooding this for 10 years.
[01:31:05.940 --> 01:31:07.940]   This is what we use at Facebook."
[01:31:07.940 --> 01:31:13.860]   I also think they probably saw what's been happening with Slack and how that's been...
[01:31:13.860 --> 01:31:15.300]   Stewart Butterfield startup.
[01:31:15.300 --> 01:31:16.300]   Yeah.
[01:31:16.300 --> 01:31:19.940]   They've been signing up enterprise customers like it's going on a style.
[01:31:19.940 --> 01:31:24.460]   The chart on that thing usage-wise is just mind-boggling.
[01:31:24.460 --> 01:31:25.620]   And so I think they...
[01:31:25.620 --> 01:31:30.500]   I'm sure they thought we've got to get a piece of that even if we can't get all of it or
[01:31:30.500 --> 01:31:33.060]   crush Slack, we need to at least be in there.
[01:31:33.060 --> 01:31:41.700]   Well, it's not too much of a stretch to think of them adding WhatsApp into this mix and making
[01:31:41.700 --> 01:31:42.700]   an enterprise.
[01:31:42.700 --> 01:31:46.260]   And of course, enterprise has requirements that needs to be a walled garden.
[01:31:46.260 --> 01:31:47.260]   You can't...
[01:31:47.260 --> 01:31:49.900]   You want it to be an intranet, not an intranet.
[01:31:49.900 --> 01:31:51.980]   You want it to be secure.
[01:31:51.980 --> 01:31:52.980]   There's a lot of neat.
[01:31:52.980 --> 01:31:56.420]   Just as with schools and classroom apps, there's special needs.
[01:31:56.420 --> 01:31:59.300]   I think this makes a lot of sense for Facebook.
[01:31:59.300 --> 01:32:04.980]   To me, this is like Facebook leaving the colleges and going out to the public.
[01:32:04.980 --> 01:32:06.500]   There is a potential to...
[01:32:06.500 --> 01:32:13.580]   I mean, assuming they can get their newsfeed algorithm working properly inside the enterprise,
[01:32:13.580 --> 01:32:19.860]   at least there's a potential for them to become a kind of central dashboard, information dashboard
[01:32:19.860 --> 01:32:23.380]   where you can find all the stuff that's relevant to your company.
[01:32:23.380 --> 01:32:25.220]   That's a huge value.
[01:32:25.220 --> 01:32:27.580]   LinkedIn, I'm sure is great.
[01:32:27.580 --> 01:32:29.780]   They're doing something similar to that.
[01:32:29.780 --> 01:32:31.620]   Because that's what they want to own.
[01:32:31.620 --> 01:32:32.620]   Yeah.
[01:32:32.620 --> 01:32:34.740]   If you think about it, it makes perfect sense.
[01:32:34.740 --> 01:32:36.420]   People want to use what they're familiar with.
[01:32:36.420 --> 01:32:40.260]   They don't want to learn a specialized tool.
[01:32:40.260 --> 01:32:42.780]   But businesses have certain needs.
[01:32:42.780 --> 01:32:44.820]   I have needs.
[01:32:44.820 --> 01:32:51.100]   And it makes sense that Facebook, just as they do with my personal needs, want to satisfy
[01:32:51.100 --> 01:32:53.260]   enterprise's needs.
[01:32:53.260 --> 01:32:54.660]   So you'll have...
[01:32:54.660 --> 01:32:56.860]   I predict now you're going to have the case where some...
[01:32:56.860 --> 01:33:00.180]   Oh, I meant to post that half-naked venture.
[01:33:00.180 --> 01:33:02.740]   My personal, not to my work.
[01:33:02.740 --> 01:33:03.740]   But that can happen anyway.
[01:33:03.740 --> 01:33:04.740]   Or my puppy.
[01:33:04.740 --> 01:33:09.180]   Well, not if you're not using Facebook for work.
[01:33:09.180 --> 01:33:10.180]   Right.
[01:33:10.180 --> 01:33:11.180]   I posted...
[01:33:11.180 --> 01:33:14.580]   We were using HipChat for a conversation and then I was talking about the...
[01:33:14.580 --> 01:33:15.580]   I remember I was on this show.
[01:33:15.580 --> 01:33:16.580]   I think I was...
[01:33:16.580 --> 01:33:20.580]   We were talking about those acronyms that teenagers use, like get naked on camera.
[01:33:20.580 --> 01:33:25.180]   So I posted them into our HipChat, which is our business chat.
[01:33:25.180 --> 01:33:26.180]   Oops.
[01:33:26.180 --> 01:33:32.900]   Well, that's okay because we've got one of our people immediately said, "Ignorly, oh,
[01:33:32.900 --> 01:33:35.540]   he's just showing off something in Twig."
[01:33:35.540 --> 01:33:42.740]   Hey, congratulations to Amazon, by the way.
[01:33:42.740 --> 01:33:45.100]   Transparent won a Golden Globe Award.
[01:33:45.100 --> 01:33:47.540]   And rightly so, by the way, it's a really great show of yours.
[01:33:47.540 --> 01:33:48.540]   I haven't watched it yet.
[01:33:48.540 --> 01:33:49.700]   I feel so behind.
[01:33:49.700 --> 01:33:52.300]   Jeffrey Tambor is wonderful in it.
[01:33:52.300 --> 01:33:53.300]   Isn't great.
[01:33:53.300 --> 01:33:58.140]   He plays the dad of a totally dysfunctional family who's decided to finally live as a
[01:33:58.140 --> 01:34:02.740]   woman, something he's felt that he is all along.
[01:34:02.740 --> 01:34:04.140]   And the kids, it's comedic.
[01:34:04.140 --> 01:34:05.140]   It's very funny.
[01:34:05.140 --> 01:34:08.340]   And in fact, I thought that's what it would be about because the name is Transparent
[01:34:08.340 --> 01:34:09.340]   and all of that.
[01:34:09.340 --> 01:34:12.540]   But really, it's as much about his totally dysfunctional family.
[01:34:12.540 --> 01:34:20.540]   And each of them have their own awful quirks, his ex-wife who's equally awful.
[01:34:20.540 --> 01:34:22.500]   It's a great, great show.
[01:34:22.500 --> 01:34:24.900]   And Jeffrey Tambor deserved the Golden Globe, I think.
[01:34:24.900 --> 01:34:26.300]   He did a great job.
[01:34:26.300 --> 01:34:31.340]   And I didn't know the writer, her father, it's the character based on her father.
[01:34:31.340 --> 01:34:36.580]   Yeah, I believe that because you can see it's deeply felt.
[01:34:36.580 --> 01:34:38.580]   And it's very insightful.
[01:34:38.580 --> 01:34:39.580]   And a great show.
[01:34:39.580 --> 01:34:40.580]   And it's Amazon only.
[01:34:40.580 --> 01:34:41.580]   And so it's a huge victory.
[01:34:41.580 --> 01:34:45.740]   And of course, if you go to Amazon, they're touting it like they've just won the World
[01:34:45.740 --> 01:34:46.740]   Series.
[01:34:46.740 --> 01:34:47.740]   It's all over the…
[01:34:47.740 --> 01:34:48.740]   Oh, that's a big deal.
[01:34:48.740 --> 01:34:49.740]   It's a very big deal.
[01:34:49.740 --> 01:34:50.740]   And now, Amazon's…
[01:34:50.740 --> 01:34:52.780]   By the way, they've been doing great stuff.
[01:34:52.780 --> 01:34:58.260]   Both Netflix and Amazon have totally proven that you don't need to be a cable network.
[01:34:58.260 --> 01:35:01.620]   You don't need to be a broadcast network to produce great programming.
[01:35:01.620 --> 01:35:03.020]   I love House of Cards.
[01:35:03.020 --> 01:35:04.020]   It's coming back.
[01:35:04.020 --> 01:35:06.020]   I love Orange is the new black.
[01:35:06.020 --> 01:35:09.740]   Amazon has Alpha House, which is incredibly funny.
[01:35:09.740 --> 01:35:10.740]   I've got some great shows.
[01:35:10.740 --> 01:35:11.740]   I've been watching…
[01:35:11.740 --> 01:35:12.740]   Can I ask you a question, Leo?
[01:35:12.740 --> 01:35:13.740]   Yeah.
[01:35:13.740 --> 01:35:14.740]   I have argued…
[01:35:14.740 --> 01:35:17.340]   You have argued that Google is in a position of conflict.
[01:35:17.340 --> 01:35:19.740]   I've argued that Google can't really own and create content.
[01:35:19.740 --> 01:35:20.740]   And really, they don't.
[01:35:20.740 --> 01:35:23.220]   That YouTube is a platform.
[01:35:23.220 --> 01:35:29.380]   So here's Amazon, which is the primary media sales operation in the world now.
[01:35:29.380 --> 01:35:31.220]   And it's making its own content.
[01:35:31.220 --> 01:35:33.500]   And I don't hear the squeals there.
[01:35:33.500 --> 01:35:34.500]   Why should you?
[01:35:34.500 --> 01:35:37.260]   Because Amazon's a retailer.
[01:35:37.260 --> 01:35:39.260]   Amazon sells its own stuff all the time.
[01:35:39.260 --> 01:35:40.260]   I mean, I would squeal…
[01:35:40.260 --> 01:35:42.540]   Well, that's what I'm so compared to Google.
[01:35:42.540 --> 01:35:43.540]   But Amazon's…
[01:35:43.540 --> 01:35:44.540]   No, but it's different.
[01:35:44.540 --> 01:35:46.340]   Google's not even trying to sell stuff.
[01:35:46.340 --> 01:35:47.340]   They're not quite different.
[01:35:47.340 --> 01:35:50.300]   Google's trying to be an objective search engine.
[01:35:50.300 --> 01:35:55.700]   Amazon's never said anything but, hey, what we do is we sell stuff for money.
[01:35:55.700 --> 01:35:56.700]   Well that's what I want.
[01:35:56.700 --> 01:35:57.700]   I want it to be objective.
[01:35:57.700 --> 01:35:58.700]   Don't you want Google to be objective?
[01:35:58.700 --> 01:35:59.700]   If you're going to rely on it…
[01:35:59.700 --> 01:36:00.700]   And then it's going to be relevant.
[01:36:00.700 --> 01:36:01.700]   No, no, I'm objective.
[01:36:01.700 --> 01:36:02.700]   I mean, it's…
[01:36:02.700 --> 01:36:03.700]   Hey, for everybody.
[01:36:03.700 --> 01:36:04.700]   No.
[01:36:04.700 --> 01:36:05.700]   They're not claiming that.
[01:36:05.700 --> 01:36:08.700]   They're claiming it's relevant to you.
[01:36:08.700 --> 01:36:10.420]   But in the beginning, they claimed it was objective.
[01:36:10.420 --> 01:36:11.420]   I would hope…
[01:36:11.420 --> 01:36:14.460]   No, it's not paid that you cannot pay for.
[01:36:14.460 --> 01:36:15.460]   No, what they claim is…
[01:36:15.460 --> 01:36:19.020]   What's the difference between paid and Google saying, well, our content's better than
[01:36:19.020 --> 01:36:20.020]   others.
[01:36:20.020 --> 01:36:23.060]   Well, I'm not saying that you prove that they do that.
[01:36:23.060 --> 01:36:24.660]   No, and they haven't.
[01:36:24.660 --> 01:36:27.020]   But that's the real fears that they will.
[01:36:27.020 --> 01:36:29.220]   And, you know, that's why it's a comprehensive interest.
[01:36:29.220 --> 01:36:30.220]   But Amazon's also…
[01:36:30.220 --> 01:36:31.220]   So I'm making my own TV show.
[01:36:31.220 --> 01:36:32.980]   You're making your own podcast.
[01:36:32.980 --> 01:36:33.980]   And now Amazon says, I'm going to…
[01:36:33.980 --> 01:36:34.980]   That's fine.
[01:36:34.980 --> 01:36:35.980]   I'm not going to promote yours.
[01:36:35.980 --> 01:36:37.380]   I'm going to promote mine.
[01:36:37.380 --> 01:36:38.380]   They're not a search engine.
[01:36:38.380 --> 01:36:39.380]   They're a store.
[01:36:39.380 --> 01:36:43.300]   They're the only way you can get sold if you make certain things now, bricks and such.
[01:36:43.300 --> 01:36:44.300]   But they…
[01:36:44.300 --> 01:36:45.940]   Well, if they become a monopoly, that's an issue.
[01:36:45.940 --> 01:36:46.940]   And they are a retailer.
[01:36:46.940 --> 01:36:50.860]   I mean, the central difference is Google did not start off as a retailer.
[01:36:50.860 --> 01:36:51.860]   Right.
[01:36:51.860 --> 01:36:52.860]   This is their business.
[01:36:52.860 --> 01:36:53.860]   And they've done this, by the way.
[01:36:53.860 --> 01:36:54.860]   Amazon makes cables, too.
[01:36:54.860 --> 01:36:55.860]   They make a lot of things.
[01:36:55.860 --> 01:36:57.820]   And by the way, I'm not complaining that Amazon shouldn't make this stuff.
[01:36:57.820 --> 01:36:59.380]   I'm just trying to compare her.
[01:36:59.380 --> 01:37:00.380]   It's not comparable.
[01:37:00.380 --> 01:37:01.380]   You lose.
[01:37:01.380 --> 01:37:02.380]   I think it is.
[01:37:02.380 --> 01:37:03.380]   I disagree.
[01:37:03.380 --> 01:37:04.380]   I disagree.
[01:37:04.380 --> 01:37:05.380]   I disagree.
[01:37:05.380 --> 01:37:06.380]   It doesn't bother me.
[01:37:06.380 --> 01:37:07.380]   Do you see anything?
[01:37:07.380 --> 01:37:08.380]   Oh.
[01:37:08.380 --> 01:37:11.020]   Well, see, and here's the other thing.
[01:37:11.020 --> 01:37:15.300]   If you're in the content creation business, there are a million competitors creating content.
[01:37:15.300 --> 01:37:17.940]   I'm not mad at Google because they want to be in the…
[01:37:17.940 --> 01:37:20.740]   If they want to be in the content creation, they have added it.
[01:37:20.740 --> 01:37:25.820]   But drop the search business because the search, the directory, is what allows people
[01:37:25.820 --> 01:37:27.460]   to discover us.
[01:37:27.460 --> 01:37:30.860]   I don't need Amazon to be discovered.
[01:37:30.860 --> 01:37:32.540]   If you're an author, you do.
[01:37:32.540 --> 01:37:34.700]   And then you have an argument.
[01:37:34.700 --> 01:37:35.700]   Then you have an argument.
[01:37:35.700 --> 01:37:36.700]   That's what I'm saying.
[01:37:36.700 --> 01:37:39.340]   And Amazon is, by the way, going into the publishing business as well.
[01:37:39.340 --> 01:37:41.220]   That's what I'm saying.
[01:37:41.220 --> 01:37:44.020]   So if we talk about the standards around Google and what they…
[01:37:44.020 --> 01:37:46.260]   Oh my God, Google's more in its own stuff.
[01:37:46.260 --> 01:37:48.780]   What I'm saying is, of course they do.
[01:37:48.780 --> 01:37:50.860]   And it's obvious when they do.
[01:37:50.860 --> 01:37:53.780]   But they also promote their competitors.
[01:37:53.780 --> 01:37:57.540]   Now Amazon also grows as competitors, by the way.
[01:37:57.540 --> 01:37:58.540]   Right?
[01:37:58.540 --> 01:37:59.540]   It allows anybody to sell.
[01:37:59.540 --> 01:38:00.540]   And you know what?
[01:38:00.540 --> 01:38:04.420]   They'd be out of business if they only sold Amazon originals on their video store.
[01:38:04.420 --> 01:38:05.420]   Oh God, yeah.
[01:38:05.420 --> 01:38:06.420]   God damn.
[01:38:06.420 --> 01:38:07.420]   As good as they are.
[01:38:07.420 --> 01:38:09.900]   There's other stuff I want to see.
[01:38:09.900 --> 01:38:14.300]   By the way, this all came up because they just signed Woody Allen to do his very first
[01:38:14.300 --> 01:38:19.760]   TV series, which is going to be called in a kind of sly inside joke, the untitled Woody
[01:38:19.760 --> 01:38:20.760]   Allen project.
[01:38:20.760 --> 01:38:24.460]   I'm sorry, but the obvious joke here is next, they're going to sign Bill Cosby.
[01:38:24.460 --> 01:38:25.780]   It is the obvious joke.
[01:38:25.780 --> 01:38:27.300]   I said they should do a duo.
[01:38:27.300 --> 01:38:28.700]   They should do a…
[01:38:28.700 --> 01:38:29.700]   Yeah.
[01:38:29.700 --> 01:38:30.700]   All right.
[01:38:30.700 --> 01:38:32.540]   I don't want to get in this conversation.
[01:38:32.540 --> 01:38:34.660]   I don't think that's comparable.
[01:38:34.660 --> 01:38:36.180]   No.
[01:38:36.180 --> 01:38:39.620]   I think the claims against Woody Allen could be questioned.
[01:38:39.620 --> 01:38:40.620]   I don't.
[01:38:40.620 --> 01:38:45.260]   I mean, in terms of shamed and questioned celebrities.
[01:38:45.260 --> 01:38:46.260]   Right.
[01:38:46.260 --> 01:38:47.260]   Right.
[01:38:47.260 --> 01:38:48.260]   Yeah.
[01:38:48.260 --> 01:38:49.260]   But yeah, I know.
[01:38:49.260 --> 01:38:53.980]   And I have to admit, I'm a little queasy going to a Woody Allen movie these days.
[01:38:53.980 --> 01:38:58.700]   I did like his comment, though, where he said, "I don't know why they did this."
[01:38:58.700 --> 01:39:03.740]   And I think it's probably going to turn out badly, and I don't really have any ideas.
[01:39:03.740 --> 01:39:08.500]   He says, "My guess is Roy Price, who is the VP of Amazon Studios, will regret this."
[01:39:08.500 --> 01:39:09.500]   That's Woody, though.
[01:39:09.500 --> 01:39:10.500]   You love Woody.
[01:39:10.500 --> 01:39:11.500]   He's totally self-deprecating.
[01:39:11.500 --> 01:39:14.740]   Certainly, he's got expectations low, so.
[01:39:14.740 --> 01:39:15.740]   Yeah.
[01:39:15.740 --> 01:39:16.740]   You know people will watch it.
[01:39:16.740 --> 01:39:18.800]   And frankly, if they got Cosby to do a show, you know people would watch it, but then
[01:39:18.800 --> 01:39:20.300]   stop buying things on Amazon.
[01:39:20.300 --> 01:39:21.300]   Yeah.
[01:39:21.300 --> 01:39:23.780]   I mean, I used to be a gigantic fan of Woody Allen.
[01:39:23.780 --> 01:39:27.420]   I also think that he's not quite what he was, but…
[01:39:27.420 --> 01:39:33.020]   Yeah, it's none of our business to discuss the allegations against him.
[01:39:33.020 --> 01:39:34.020]   But the…
[01:39:34.020 --> 01:39:35.020]   Well, it's not alligator.
[01:39:35.020 --> 01:39:36.020]   Well, I'm not talking about that.
[01:39:36.020 --> 01:39:38.580]   I'm just talking about the fact, just the known fact that he…
[01:39:38.580 --> 01:39:40.300]   He's not as good as he used to be.
[01:39:40.300 --> 01:39:41.300]   He did his stepdaughter.
[01:39:41.300 --> 01:39:43.460]   What he did is married his stepdaughter.
[01:39:43.460 --> 01:39:46.060]   And married his stepdaughter, but they didn't live together.
[01:39:46.060 --> 01:39:48.100]   She lived down the road.
[01:39:48.100 --> 01:39:49.100]   Yeah.
[01:39:49.100 --> 01:39:50.100]   Right.
[01:39:50.100 --> 01:39:51.100]   Sure.
[01:39:51.100 --> 01:39:55.900]   I mean, you can not like somebody because he married a very young woman who was, in
[01:39:55.900 --> 01:39:59.420]   fact, his stepdaughter, but that's not illegal.
[01:39:59.420 --> 01:40:02.700]   The other allegations that he molested his stepdaughter are illegal.
[01:40:02.700 --> 01:40:03.700]   Yeah.
[01:40:03.700 --> 01:40:05.540]   That's not a bad factor.
[01:40:05.540 --> 01:40:06.540]   Yeah.
[01:40:06.540 --> 01:40:07.540]   That's all.
[01:40:07.540 --> 01:40:12.220]   And lots of his movies, you know, he's continued to age and the people that he's
[01:40:12.220 --> 01:40:13.660]   romantically involved with in the movies.
[01:40:13.660 --> 01:40:14.660]   Yeah.
[01:40:14.660 --> 01:40:15.660]   Okay, that's a little creepy.
[01:40:15.660 --> 01:40:16.660]   Yeah, younger.
[01:40:16.660 --> 01:40:18.140]   But again, that's not illegal.
[01:40:18.140 --> 01:40:19.140]   Just creepy.
[01:40:19.140 --> 01:40:20.140]   Mm-hmm.
[01:40:20.140 --> 01:40:23.900]   Well, and I, you know, I think some of his later movies are great.
[01:40:23.900 --> 01:40:28.620]   I love the midnight in Paris was one of his best movies, I thought.
[01:40:28.620 --> 01:40:29.620]   Yeah, that's true.
[01:40:29.620 --> 01:40:30.620]   Did you think that like that, Jeff?
[01:40:30.620 --> 01:40:31.620]   Yeah.
[01:40:31.620 --> 01:40:32.620]   It was pretty good.
[01:40:32.620 --> 01:40:33.620]   Yeah, that what I liked.
[01:40:33.620 --> 01:40:34.620]   Yeah.
[01:40:34.620 --> 01:40:35.620]   I liked him.
[01:40:35.620 --> 01:40:36.620]   But one reason I liked it was because he wasn't in it.
[01:40:36.620 --> 01:40:37.620]   Right.
[01:40:37.620 --> 01:40:38.620]   Yeah, he should stop being in his movies.
[01:40:38.620 --> 01:40:39.620]   I don't know if he'll be in the TV show.
[01:40:39.620 --> 01:40:41.780]   I guess he will.
[01:40:41.780 --> 01:40:43.980]   I need to watch Annie Hall again and see if it holds up.
[01:40:43.980 --> 01:40:44.980]   Oh, it holds up.
[01:40:44.980 --> 01:40:46.380]   Oh, it totally holds up.
[01:40:46.380 --> 01:40:47.380]   Absolutely holds up.
[01:40:47.380 --> 01:40:48.380]   I would imagine it does.
[01:40:48.380 --> 01:40:50.180]   And Nana's not so much.
[01:40:50.180 --> 01:40:54.780]   Let's see.
[01:40:54.780 --> 01:40:59.020]   I think we've covered everything.
[01:40:59.020 --> 01:41:05.940]   Artificial intelligence experts are all signing a letter saying, "Aah, aah, aah."
[01:41:05.940 --> 01:41:08.420]   We've got to protect mankind from machines.
[01:41:08.420 --> 01:41:09.420]   Skynut.
[01:41:09.420 --> 01:41:10.420]   Skynut.
[01:41:10.420 --> 01:41:14.900]   I'm going to run a session in this, a dinner session of this adaavos next week.
[01:41:14.900 --> 01:41:16.420]   And so this was interesting to me.
[01:41:16.420 --> 01:41:17.620]   Oh, this will be interesting.
[01:41:17.620 --> 01:41:18.620]   What's it called?
[01:41:18.620 --> 01:41:19.620]   What's it about?
[01:41:19.620 --> 01:41:22.620]   The face of me, man versus machine kind of thing.
[01:41:22.620 --> 01:41:25.940]   And there's two AI robotic people.
[01:41:25.940 --> 01:41:30.140]   There's the Archbishop of Ireland.
[01:41:30.140 --> 01:41:39.620]   There's a technology historian and a biological, I could print organs for you, guy.
[01:41:39.620 --> 01:41:41.460]   They're going to be the discussion leaders.
[01:41:41.460 --> 01:41:43.300]   And it'll be fascinating.
[01:41:43.300 --> 01:41:46.220]   It'll be absolutely interesting.
[01:41:46.220 --> 01:41:48.940]   And the good thing about it is there's no techno panic representative there.
[01:41:48.940 --> 01:41:51.220]   There'll be people in the room will be saying, "Oh my God."
[01:41:51.220 --> 01:41:52.220]   But here are the technologists.
[01:41:52.220 --> 01:41:57.260]   And so the discussion that I want to have is, "Okay, you're all making these technologies
[01:41:57.260 --> 01:41:59.100]   and same as this letter in a way.
[01:41:59.100 --> 01:42:00.300]   How do you protect us?
[01:42:00.300 --> 01:42:02.820]   You presume you can because otherwise you wouldn't be doing it.
[01:42:02.820 --> 01:42:03.820]   You think it's evil."
[01:42:03.820 --> 01:42:08.180]   So talk about what are you going to do to make all this okay so that we can take advantage
[01:42:08.180 --> 01:42:09.420]   of these technologies.
[01:42:09.420 --> 01:42:10.940]   I want to point you to two books.
[01:42:10.940 --> 01:42:15.140]   These are two people we've interviewed on triangulation on this subject.
[01:42:15.140 --> 01:42:20.300]   The first is a guy named James Barrett who wrote a book called Our Final Invention, Artificial
[01:42:20.300 --> 01:42:22.860]   Intelligence and the End of the Human Era.
[01:42:22.860 --> 01:42:23.860]   He's a journalist.
[01:42:23.860 --> 01:42:29.460]   He's not a scientist, but he did interview a lot of experts in AI, many of whom I think
[01:42:29.460 --> 01:42:34.980]   agree that we've got to tread lightly here because there's a big risk.
[01:42:34.980 --> 01:42:39.260]   I asked Ray Kurzweil about that because he's one of the people who believes that the singularity
[01:42:39.260 --> 01:42:42.780]   is nigh and that the machines will be as smart as humans any day now.
[01:42:42.780 --> 01:42:44.860]   He said, "Don't worry.
[01:42:44.860 --> 01:42:47.340]   The machines will think of us as mom and dad.
[01:42:47.340 --> 01:42:49.340]   They'll take care of us."
[01:42:49.340 --> 01:42:52.500]   I heard Ray Kurzweil agree with that.
[01:42:52.500 --> 01:42:54.300]   I heard him speak at Google.
[01:42:54.300 --> 01:43:00.420]   He said basically, "We're not going to get there in the way that you faint."
[01:43:00.420 --> 01:43:02.500]   That doesn't mean we don't have to worry.
[01:43:02.500 --> 01:43:04.060]   Here's the other one.
[01:43:04.060 --> 01:43:10.540]   Nick Postrum is a, this is a guy actually with a very interesting CV.
[01:43:10.540 --> 01:43:13.500]   He's not just a computer scientist.
[01:43:13.500 --> 01:43:17.740]   He does a lot of stuff, but his book Superintelligence really talks about these issues.
[01:43:17.740 --> 01:43:20.140]   It's a really good book.
[01:43:20.140 --> 01:43:22.660]   He was fascinating.
[01:43:22.660 --> 01:43:24.420]   He is a guy who was working in this field.
[01:43:24.420 --> 01:43:33.420]   His professor at Oxford and director of the Future of Humanity Institute there.
[01:43:33.420 --> 01:43:35.260]   Very interesting, fella.
[01:43:35.260 --> 01:43:45.220]   Just the people at your event, what they think a Google self-driving car should do if sacrificing
[01:43:45.220 --> 01:43:52.340]   the occupants of the car would actually prevent more deaths than not sacrificing the act.
[01:43:52.340 --> 01:43:55.340]   You've talked about this on the show, haven't we, Jeff?
[01:43:55.340 --> 01:43:57.780]   Yes, we have.
[01:43:57.780 --> 01:44:00.620]   But it's an art calculation to make with maturity.
[01:44:00.620 --> 01:44:04.740]   Well, does this self-driving car look and say, "Well, if I swerve into the lane with
[01:44:04.740 --> 01:44:07.140]   the bus, I could kill 20 people.
[01:44:07.140 --> 01:44:11.540]   But if I drive off the cliff on the right, I'll only kill the guy inside."
[01:44:11.540 --> 01:44:12.540]   Right.
[01:44:12.540 --> 01:44:16.500]   So, the smart thing overall, societally, would be drive off the cliff.
[01:44:16.500 --> 01:44:22.140]   Well, you saw that amazing video of the, what is it, 169 car pile up at Michigan?
[01:44:22.140 --> 01:44:23.140]   Yeah.
[01:44:23.140 --> 01:44:25.140]   Phenomenal, phenomenal video.
[01:44:25.140 --> 01:44:26.140]   And you wonder what--
[01:44:26.140 --> 01:44:28.100]   Is that the one where the Spirecracker truck blew up?
[01:44:28.100 --> 01:44:29.100]   Was that one?
[01:44:29.100 --> 01:44:30.100]   Yes.
[01:44:30.100 --> 01:44:32.940]   You see these vehicles come barreling down.
[01:44:32.940 --> 01:44:34.820]   And man, there is nothing they can do.
[01:44:34.820 --> 01:44:38.380]   They've got two seconds and they smash on top of things.
[01:44:38.380 --> 01:44:40.780]   What would a self-driving universe look like?
[01:44:40.780 --> 01:44:42.620]   It wouldn't be barreling down the road, I don't think.
[01:44:42.620 --> 01:44:45.620]   And they'd have-- they'd also be in connection with what's ahead of them saying, "Whoa!"
[01:44:45.620 --> 01:44:46.620]   Exactly.
[01:44:46.620 --> 01:44:47.860]   They're still around now.
[01:44:47.860 --> 01:44:48.860]   Yeah.
[01:44:48.860 --> 01:44:51.260]   I'm going to find a video on myself.
[01:44:51.260 --> 01:44:53.300]   You haven't seen this?
[01:44:53.300 --> 01:44:54.300]   Oh.
[01:44:54.300 --> 01:44:56.820]   Ways should have told them that that was coming.
[01:44:56.820 --> 01:45:01.820]   Well, but I think a smart car would, of course, do a better job than humans in an environment
[01:45:01.820 --> 01:45:02.820]   like that, right?
[01:45:02.820 --> 01:45:04.700]   Yeah, it would have data from ahead.
[01:45:04.700 --> 01:45:05.700]   You'd be networked.
[01:45:05.700 --> 01:45:07.700]   The network would save you.
[01:45:07.700 --> 01:45:09.060]   Here is-- is this it?
[01:45:09.060 --> 01:45:13.340]   The fireworks go off following the accident?
[01:45:13.340 --> 01:45:15.900]   No, now we have to watch tennis.
[01:45:15.900 --> 01:45:16.900]   Come on, go go.
[01:45:16.900 --> 01:45:18.620]   It's a funny commercial.
[01:45:18.620 --> 01:45:20.060]   It's the John McEnroe commercial?
[01:45:20.060 --> 01:45:21.060]   Yeah.
[01:45:21.060 --> 01:45:22.060]   That's a funny one.
[01:45:22.060 --> 01:45:23.060]   It's a Chase commercial.
[01:45:23.060 --> 01:45:24.060]   At least.
[01:45:24.060 --> 01:45:25.060]   Yeah.
[01:45:25.060 --> 01:45:26.060]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:45:26.060 --> 01:45:29.700]   All right, since Chase has done, we get to see this fiery--
[01:45:29.700 --> 01:45:32.780]   A little free advertising for a fiery wreck from the internet.
[01:45:32.780 --> 01:45:33.780]   And I'm going to go to the internet.
[01:45:33.780 --> 01:45:34.780]   And I'm going to go to the internet.
[01:45:34.780 --> 01:45:35.780]   And I'm going to go to the internet.
[01:45:35.780 --> 01:45:36.780]   And I'm going to go to the internet.
[01:45:36.780 --> 01:45:37.780]   And I'm going to go to the internet.
[01:45:37.780 --> 01:45:38.780]   And I'm going to go to the internet.
[01:45:38.780 --> 01:45:39.780]   And I'm going to go to the internet.
[01:45:39.780 --> 01:45:40.780]   And I'm going to go to the internet.
[01:45:40.780 --> 01:45:41.780]   And I'm going to go to the internet.
[01:45:41.780 --> 01:45:42.780]   And I'm going to go to the internet.
[01:45:42.780 --> 01:45:43.780]   And I'm going to go to the internet.
[01:45:43.780 --> 01:45:44.780]   And I'm going to go to the internet.
[01:45:44.780 --> 01:45:45.780]   And I'm going to go to the internet.
[01:45:45.780 --> 01:45:46.780]   And I'm going to go to the internet.
[01:45:46.780 --> 01:45:47.780]   And I'm going to go to the internet.
[01:45:47.780 --> 01:45:48.780]   And I'm going to go to the internet.
[01:45:48.780 --> 01:45:49.780]   And I'm going to go to the internet.
[01:45:49.780 --> 01:45:50.780]   And I'm going to go to the internet.

[01:47:08.780 --> 01:47:09.780]   And I'm going to go to the internet.
[01:47:09.780 --> 01:47:14.780]   No, but we're vertical radio.
[01:47:14.780 --> 01:47:15.780]   Oh, oh, oh.
[01:47:15.780 --> 01:47:16.780]   Yeah, and this is nothing to be just--
[01:47:16.780 --> 01:47:17.780]   And just keep calm.
[01:47:17.780 --> 01:47:18.780]   Nothing to jest about because--
[01:47:18.780 --> 01:47:19.780]   No, one person was killed.
[01:47:19.780 --> 01:47:20.780]   Yeah.
[01:47:20.780 --> 01:47:21.780]   Yeah.
[01:47:21.780 --> 01:47:22.780]   Tractor out.
[01:47:22.780 --> 01:47:23.780]   Oh.
[01:47:23.780 --> 01:47:26.780]   Just that horrible sound.
[01:47:26.780 --> 01:47:28.780]   Because they're going closely.
[01:47:28.780 --> 01:47:31.780]   Well, they-- yeah, on snow in the fog, it seems--
[01:47:31.780 --> 01:47:33.780]   In a blinding snow.
[01:47:33.780 --> 01:47:36.780]   Humans are not the best drivers in the world.
[01:47:36.780 --> 01:47:37.780]   No.
[01:47:37.780 --> 01:47:39.780]   In the world, what am I talking about?
[01:47:39.780 --> 01:47:40.780]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:47:40.780 --> 01:47:42.780]   Well, on Mars we're following.
[01:47:42.780 --> 01:47:44.780]   And listen to the guy on the phone.
[01:47:44.780 --> 01:47:46.780]   He's saying, oh, no, oh, no.
[01:47:46.780 --> 01:47:47.780]   This does happen.
[01:47:47.780 --> 01:47:48.780]   Right.
[01:47:48.780 --> 01:47:49.780]   And then he's saying, get out.
[01:47:49.780 --> 01:47:50.780]   Because there's somebody behind you coming.
[01:47:50.780 --> 01:47:51.780]   Right.
[01:47:51.780 --> 01:47:53.780]   This happens regularly near where I live.
[01:47:53.780 --> 01:47:54.780]   Oh, I'm sure that's--
[01:47:54.780 --> 01:47:55.780]   near the--
[01:47:55.780 --> 01:47:56.780]   near the circle.
[01:47:56.780 --> 01:47:58.780]   And it happens here in drizzle.
[01:47:58.780 --> 01:48:00.780]   But snow squalls come up very quickly.
[01:48:00.780 --> 01:48:03.780]   So you can be in a clear area.
[01:48:03.780 --> 01:48:05.780]   And then all of a sudden there's a squall.
[01:48:05.780 --> 01:48:08.780]   And on the other side of that is a truck that Jacknaved.
[01:48:08.780 --> 01:48:09.780]   Yeah.
[01:48:09.780 --> 01:48:11.780]   Horrible.
[01:48:11.780 --> 01:48:14.780]   I want to-- I want a self-driving car.
[01:48:14.780 --> 01:48:15.780]   I have kind of-- for the most part--
[01:48:15.780 --> 01:48:16.780]   I do have a self-driving car.
[01:48:16.780 --> 01:48:20.780]   It warns me if I try to switch lanes with another car in the lane.
[01:48:20.780 --> 01:48:21.780]   It warns me if I drift with it.
[01:48:21.780 --> 01:48:22.780]   It's how the lanes--
[01:48:22.780 --> 01:48:24.780]   It starts to vibrate the steering wheel.
[01:48:24.780 --> 01:48:26.780]   It has adaptive cruise control.
[01:48:26.780 --> 01:48:29.780]   So I can just turn on cruise control and close my eyes.
[01:48:29.780 --> 01:48:31.780]   Because if the car in front of me slows down my car,
[01:48:31.780 --> 01:48:32.780]   I'll slow down.
[01:48:32.780 --> 01:48:33.780]   If it stops, my car stops.
[01:48:33.780 --> 01:48:34.780]   Really?
[01:48:34.780 --> 01:48:38.780]   It keeps a following distance that's really the right following
[01:48:38.780 --> 01:48:39.780]   distance, which is--
[01:48:39.780 --> 01:48:40.780]   What kind of car is it?
[01:48:40.780 --> 01:48:41.780]   It's an Audi.
[01:48:41.780 --> 01:48:43.780]   It's surprising because, God, I'm far behind.
[01:48:43.780 --> 01:48:44.780]   Really?
[01:48:44.780 --> 01:48:45.780]   I should be this far.
[01:48:45.780 --> 01:48:46.780]   Yes, you should.
[01:48:46.780 --> 01:48:47.780]   Did you say that?
[01:48:47.780 --> 01:48:49.780]   It's a Tesla video where it reads the speed sign
[01:48:49.780 --> 01:48:51.780]   and automatically decreases the speed?
[01:48:51.780 --> 01:48:52.780]   Yeah, that's cool.
[01:48:52.780 --> 01:48:54.780]   I want to say that.
[01:48:54.780 --> 01:48:58.780]   What happens if a Google self-driving car is potentially
[01:48:58.780 --> 01:49:01.780]   going to be an accident that would only kill the occupants
[01:49:01.780 --> 01:49:03.780]   of a Microsoft self-driving car?
[01:49:03.780 --> 01:49:07.780]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:49:07.780 --> 01:49:09.780]   Computers are smart enough.
[01:49:09.780 --> 01:49:12.780]   By the way, somebody says, "That's not cool, Leo.
[01:49:12.780 --> 01:49:13.780]   You shouldn't close your eyes."
[01:49:13.780 --> 01:49:16.780]   I don't really close my eyes.
[01:49:16.780 --> 01:49:17.780]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:49:17.780 --> 01:49:18.780]   I think I'm nuts.
[01:49:18.780 --> 01:49:21.780]   So you still have to steer, Leo.
[01:49:21.780 --> 01:49:22.780]   No?
[01:49:22.780 --> 01:49:24.780]   It's a joke.
[01:49:24.780 --> 01:49:28.780]   We're going to take a break and we shall return with pictures--
[01:49:28.780 --> 01:49:29.780]   Do you want us to--
[01:49:29.780 --> 01:49:30.780]   No, we're not.
[01:49:30.780 --> 01:49:32.780]   Yeah, but briefly, only briefly.

[01:50:59.020 --> 01:51:02.940]   Well, normally we would do Gina's tip here.
[01:51:02.940 --> 01:51:05.020]   I think we're going to have to rejigger how we do these things.
[01:51:05.020 --> 01:51:07.500]   Let's let Matthew Ingram of GigaOM, great to have you here,
[01:51:07.500 --> 01:51:09.060]   Matthew.
[01:51:09.060 --> 01:51:12.940]   Is there anything you'd like to talk about, a movie you saw,
[01:51:12.940 --> 01:51:14.980]   a book you read?
[01:51:14.980 --> 01:51:17.060]   A snowflake you admired?
[01:51:17.060 --> 01:51:19.940]   Well, I did see the imitation game.
[01:51:19.940 --> 01:51:22.060]   You know we should talk about that.
[01:51:22.060 --> 01:51:25.740]   And I mentioned when I got home that the first thing I was
[01:51:25.740 --> 01:51:28.180]   going to do-- I know a little bit about Alan Turing,
[01:51:28.180 --> 01:51:29.300]   but not that much.
[01:51:29.300 --> 01:51:32.540]   The first thing I was going to do was research how much of the
[01:51:32.540 --> 01:51:35.780]   movie is just Hollywood BS and how much of it is actually
[01:51:35.780 --> 01:51:38.140]   what Turing was like.
[01:51:38.140 --> 01:51:40.860]   And unfortunately, a lot of the movies--
[01:51:40.860 --> 01:51:42.100]   It's pretty bad.
[01:51:42.100 --> 01:51:46.780]   Yes, and the picture that it sort of paints of Turing is not--
[01:51:46.780 --> 01:51:50.900]   is unfair in a lot of ways and goes for the sort of easy--
[01:51:50.900 --> 01:51:53.820]   you know, he was a nerd who couldn't mix with people,
[01:51:53.820 --> 01:51:58.420]   and none of which I think was the way it's portrayed in the
[01:51:58.420 --> 01:51:58.660]   movie.
[01:51:58.660 --> 01:51:59.580]   But--
[01:51:59.580 --> 01:52:00.220]   No, it was good.
[01:52:00.220 --> 01:52:03.420]   And it's a wonderful movie.
[01:52:03.420 --> 01:52:04.900]   He is great.
[01:52:04.900 --> 01:52:06.500]   The acting is great.
[01:52:06.500 --> 01:52:10.940]   But as the Guardian points out, in a way the movie slanders--
[01:52:10.940 --> 01:52:11.300]   Yeah.
[01:52:11.300 --> 01:52:11.900]   Alan Turing.
[01:52:11.900 --> 01:52:14.460]   And what's sad is that Alan Turing was persecuted and
[01:52:14.460 --> 01:52:19.380]   slandered and reviled by Britain even though he made a
[01:52:19.380 --> 01:52:21.140]   huge contribution to the war effort.
[01:52:21.140 --> 01:52:24.660]   And frankly, to the industry, we love so much.
[01:52:24.660 --> 01:52:28.260]   To the invention of computing--
[01:52:28.260 --> 01:52:29.500]   It's the father of modern computing.
[01:52:29.500 --> 01:52:31.020]   It's a father of modern computing.
[01:52:31.020 --> 01:52:35.540]   And so while I loved the movie, and I had the same reaction
[01:52:35.540 --> 01:52:38.060]   as you, Matthew, I thought, well, this is based on a well
[01:52:38.060 --> 01:52:38.780]   known biography.
[01:52:38.780 --> 01:52:40.900]   It must be accurate.
[01:52:40.900 --> 01:52:43.460]   There's some horrific things that they do, the chief of
[01:52:43.460 --> 01:52:45.540]   which-- and I won't give you a spoiler.
[01:52:45.540 --> 01:52:49.300]   But in effect, the movie implies that--
[01:52:49.300 --> 01:52:52.980]   So the movie, which is very much at the end, it says, tens
[01:52:52.980 --> 01:53:00.020]   of thousands of Britons were put in jail for homosexuality.
[01:53:00.020 --> 01:53:02.420]   And he was persecuted.
[01:53:02.420 --> 01:53:04.580]   He was chemically castrated and eventually committed
[01:53:04.580 --> 01:53:08.940]   suicide because of the harassment in the '50s.
[01:53:08.940 --> 01:53:13.620]   So they're in some ways doing the right thing by letting
[01:53:13.620 --> 01:53:15.860]   people know how awful that was.
[01:53:15.860 --> 01:53:21.460]   But there's a moment in which he's blackmailed by a spy.
[01:53:21.460 --> 01:53:23.100]   And the spy says, I'll tell him you're gay.
[01:53:23.100 --> 01:53:23.900]   And he goes, OK.
[01:53:23.900 --> 01:53:27.580]   And he not only breaks the law, but acts in a cowardly
[01:53:27.580 --> 01:53:29.860]   fashion to hide the spy's identity.
[01:53:29.860 --> 01:53:31.180]   And none of that happened.
[01:53:31.180 --> 01:53:31.620]   Right.
[01:53:31.620 --> 01:53:32.900]   None of that happened.
[01:53:32.900 --> 01:53:36.860]   So that's the slander that the Guardian is talking about.
[01:53:36.860 --> 01:53:42.780]   And actually, the thing that bugged me was that they go
[01:53:42.780 --> 01:53:47.940]   for this sort of easy trope of the nerd genius who doesn't
[01:53:47.940 --> 01:53:51.540]   understand a joke and can't make friends, none of which
[01:53:51.540 --> 01:53:52.940]   was apparently the case.
[01:53:52.940 --> 01:53:55.220]   The other things I've read.
[01:53:55.220 --> 01:53:58.500]   So that's a kind of easy stereotype.
[01:53:58.500 --> 01:54:00.860]   But it doesn't really--
[01:54:00.860 --> 01:54:04.300]   I wish someone would make a movie where they celebrate
[01:54:04.300 --> 01:54:05.180]   his accomplishments.
[01:54:05.180 --> 01:54:08.540]   They don't even tell you how the enigma-breaker works.
[01:54:08.540 --> 01:54:12.740]   They don't even discuss all the things that he did.
[01:54:13.500 --> 01:54:15.180]   That were groundbreaking.
[01:54:15.180 --> 01:54:18.780]   He just seems like a giant nerd who builds this thing
[01:54:18.780 --> 01:54:20.220]   and then wins the war.
[01:54:20.220 --> 01:54:21.740]   It's not.
[01:54:21.740 --> 01:54:22.340]   Anyway.
[01:54:22.340 --> 01:54:24.260]   So it was disappointing in that sense.
[01:54:24.260 --> 01:54:26.060]   I found a wonderfully entertaining movie.
[01:54:26.060 --> 01:54:27.820]   And I love Benedict Cumberbatch.
[01:54:27.820 --> 01:54:28.180]   But--
[01:54:28.180 --> 01:54:28.780]   He's great.
[01:54:28.780 --> 01:54:29.820]   Does a good job.
[01:54:29.820 --> 01:54:34.300]   And he will get an Oscar nomination, no doubt about it.
[01:54:34.300 --> 01:54:35.820]   Might even win.
[01:54:35.820 --> 01:54:41.540]   But for those of us who want to honor Alan Turing's memory
[01:54:41.540 --> 01:54:44.900]   for the amazing contributions he made--
[01:54:44.900 --> 01:54:45.860]   Not great for that.
[01:54:45.860 --> 01:54:47.100]   This is not great.
[01:54:47.100 --> 01:54:49.900]   Yeah, I'm kind of with you on that.
[01:54:49.900 --> 01:54:53.020]   And once I read this article, I went, oh.
[01:54:53.020 --> 01:54:54.740]   Yeah, and I get the feeling--
[01:54:54.740 --> 01:54:55.940]   like most people probably won't.
[01:54:55.940 --> 01:54:59.540]   So on the good side, there'll be exposed to, oh, there was a
[01:54:59.540 --> 01:55:00.580]   guy named Alan Turing.
[01:55:00.580 --> 01:55:02.140]   And he was persecuted.
[01:55:02.140 --> 01:55:03.420]   And he did these amazing things.
[01:55:03.420 --> 01:55:06.300]   But they'll-- the picture of him they will get will not
[01:55:06.300 --> 01:55:07.340]   be sort of realistic.
[01:55:07.340 --> 01:55:09.620]   You know, they do the same thing with Mark Zuckerberg
[01:55:09.620 --> 01:55:12.060]   and the social network.
[01:55:12.060 --> 01:55:13.780]   And it was wrong.
[01:55:13.780 --> 01:55:14.500]   It was wrong.
[01:55:14.500 --> 01:55:19.460]   And in fact, they made up the whole basis of the movie was
[01:55:19.460 --> 01:55:21.460]   that his girlfriend dumped him.
[01:55:21.460 --> 01:55:24.060]   And in fact, it's not true he's married to her now.
[01:55:24.060 --> 01:55:24.860]   But--
[01:55:24.860 --> 01:55:28.500]   I'm binge watching "The Good Wife," which I--
[01:55:28.500 --> 01:55:28.980]   Me too.
[01:55:28.980 --> 01:55:29.740]   I'm great, sure.
[01:55:29.740 --> 01:55:31.060]   Love it.
[01:55:31.060 --> 01:55:36.300]   And so in the second season, they have just a copy of--
[01:55:36.300 --> 01:55:37.060]   then they say it up.
[01:55:37.060 --> 01:55:38.620]   They make a reference in front of Zuckerberg.
[01:55:38.620 --> 01:55:41.620]   But it's-- it's all-- it's exactly the same story.
[01:55:41.620 --> 01:55:42.120]   Right?
[01:55:42.120 --> 01:55:43.300]   And it's a guy fighting--
[01:55:43.300 --> 01:55:45.940]   and then the stupid screenwriter is saying, I don't care
[01:55:45.940 --> 01:55:46.420]   about the facts.
[01:55:46.420 --> 01:55:47.260]   I care about the truth.
[01:55:47.260 --> 01:55:49.060]   Wow.
[01:55:49.060 --> 01:55:50.980]   I can't wait-- you know, the show--
[01:55:50.980 --> 01:55:52.380]   I'm in first season.
[01:55:52.380 --> 01:55:55.580]   It starts off like a traditional kind of procedural lawyer
[01:55:55.580 --> 01:55:56.660]   show.
[01:55:56.660 --> 01:55:58.820]   And it's actually pretty bad.
[01:55:58.820 --> 01:56:04.180]   Like all the crimes get solved by kind of this Deus Ex
[01:56:04.180 --> 01:56:06.180]   machina that appears-- oh, look, here's a clue.
[01:56:06.180 --> 01:56:08.180]   Oh, he's exonerated.
[01:56:08.180 --> 01:56:12.140]   But then around episode 17 of the first season,
[01:56:12.140 --> 01:56:14.700]   it suddenly gets ambiguous and interesting.
[01:56:14.700 --> 01:56:16.220]   And then it starts to deal with some really--
[01:56:16.220 --> 01:56:16.740]   Really?
[01:56:16.740 --> 01:56:17.260]   God.
[01:56:17.260 --> 01:56:17.780]   Yeah.
[01:56:17.780 --> 01:56:19.620]   I watched-- weird thing was, I wanted to watch--
[01:56:19.620 --> 01:56:21.660]   Chris, I thought I'd watch them both ends.
[01:56:21.660 --> 01:56:23.820]   So I watched season-- we're in season six now.
[01:56:23.820 --> 01:56:26.340]   I watched all of season five.
[01:56:26.340 --> 01:56:29.500]   I watched season-- well, I was watching one try not to buy it.
[01:56:29.500 --> 01:56:31.380]   I finally gave up and bought and buy it every season.
[01:56:31.380 --> 01:56:34.300]   It's all on Amazon Prime for free.
[01:56:34.300 --> 01:56:35.940]   I know, but I'm on airplanes.
[01:56:35.940 --> 01:56:37.500]   Oh, airplanes.
[01:56:37.500 --> 01:56:39.820]   So I've just bought the day of my seasons.
[01:56:39.820 --> 01:56:40.580]   And I'm watching it.
[01:56:40.580 --> 01:56:43.340]   So I'm full season and a half now at the beginning
[01:56:43.340 --> 01:56:46.420]   and try not to watch the end.
[01:56:46.420 --> 01:56:48.300]   But I know I have my own spoiler.
[01:56:48.300 --> 01:56:50.260]   It's really weird what-- but each show is really good.
[01:56:50.260 --> 01:56:51.020]   It's super.
[01:56:51.020 --> 01:56:52.500]   And Alan Keating is wonderful.
[01:56:52.500 --> 01:56:53.260]   She's really good.
[01:56:53.260 --> 01:56:53.940]   She's wonderful.
[01:56:53.940 --> 01:56:55.020]   It's great.
[01:56:55.020 --> 01:56:56.820]   And Alan Keating is a good one with her.
[01:56:56.820 --> 01:56:58.980]   Anything with Alan Keating, I'll just watch.
[01:56:58.980 --> 01:57:01.940]   I think I'm going to go see Cabaret.
[01:57:01.940 --> 01:57:03.140]   He's in--
[01:57:03.140 --> 01:57:07.380]   I saw him in Cabaret in the old studio 54.
[01:57:07.380 --> 01:57:08.380]   Some music.
[01:57:08.380 --> 01:57:09.460]   It's great.
[01:57:09.460 --> 01:57:11.780]   He's wonderful.
[01:57:11.780 --> 01:57:14.300]   I can't remember who played Sally.
[01:57:14.300 --> 01:57:15.660]   Emma Stone is now.
[01:57:15.660 --> 01:57:17.180]   Yes, that would be good.
[01:57:17.180 --> 01:57:20.540]   The person I saw play Sally Bowles was not an actor.
[01:57:20.540 --> 01:57:22.100]   She was like a celebrity.
[01:57:22.100 --> 01:57:25.300]   And so that wasn't great.
[01:57:25.300 --> 01:57:27.540]   It was somebody like Annie Wilson from Heart or something.
[01:57:27.540 --> 01:57:29.420]   He was something he's just like on random.
[01:57:29.420 --> 01:57:33.020]   He's like a random-- oh, this will sell tickets.
[01:57:33.020 --> 01:57:33.780]   Kind of a thing.
[01:57:33.780 --> 01:57:36.180]   But he is great.
[01:57:36.180 --> 01:57:37.540]   People are pointing out, by the way,
[01:57:37.540 --> 01:57:40.340]   that the other movie for nerds that everybody should watch
[01:57:40.340 --> 01:57:43.340]   is the theory of everything.
[01:57:43.340 --> 01:57:44.860]   Stephen Hawking story, which I haven't seen.
[01:57:44.860 --> 01:57:46.460]   Have you seen that, Matthew?
[01:57:46.460 --> 01:57:47.100]   No, I haven't.
[01:57:47.100 --> 01:57:49.100]   But I really want to because I heard Eddie Redmayne
[01:57:49.100 --> 01:57:50.900]   does an amazing job.
[01:57:50.900 --> 01:57:53.300]   You know, he'll win the Oscar because that's
[01:57:53.300 --> 01:57:55.180]   how you win an Oscar if you want it.
[01:57:55.180 --> 01:57:56.900]   Yeah, playing disabled people generally.
[01:57:56.900 --> 01:57:58.940]   Guarantees you an Oscar.
[01:57:58.940 --> 01:58:00.540]   But it does look like he does an amazing job.
[01:58:00.540 --> 01:58:02.900]   And that one I think is a little more accurate.
[01:58:02.900 --> 01:58:05.580]   It's a little harder to slander somebody who's still alive.
[01:58:05.580 --> 01:58:06.780]   Or maybe not.
[01:58:06.780 --> 01:58:09.420]   Actually, Zuckerberg.
[01:58:09.420 --> 01:58:13.340]   And they do go into the fact that he dumped his wife.
[01:58:13.340 --> 01:58:14.220]   Which is--
[01:58:14.220 --> 01:58:14.820]   I have to watch.
[01:58:14.820 --> 01:58:18.340]   I'm trying to paper that over.
[01:58:18.340 --> 01:58:20.700]   Mr. Jarvis, you have a number?
[01:58:20.700 --> 01:58:23.300]   Yeah, I have a few.
[01:58:23.300 --> 01:58:25.060]   Where is it?
[01:58:25.060 --> 01:58:26.780]   So two things that I found fascinating.
[01:58:26.780 --> 01:58:30.140]   One is-- I didn't know this.
[01:58:30.140 --> 01:58:35.300]   According to RW Baird, analyst, Google's desktop search
[01:58:35.300 --> 01:58:39.740]   revenue is now below 50% of Google's total revenue.
[01:58:39.740 --> 01:58:41.700]   Whoa.
[01:58:41.700 --> 01:58:44.860]   Whoa, I heard reaction.
[01:58:44.860 --> 01:58:47.580]   And the other little point that I thought
[01:58:47.580 --> 01:58:49.460]   was interesting here-- and I'm going to start the street.
[01:58:49.460 --> 01:58:54.300]   And it's going to play a video to me, which I hate--
[01:58:54.300 --> 01:58:58.460]   is that this says, credit-suisse analyst
[01:58:58.460 --> 01:59:03.060]   says that Google plays revenue run rate at $4 billion
[01:59:03.060 --> 01:59:07.780]   is equivalent to Google's YouTube revenue run rate--
[01:59:07.780 --> 01:59:09.260]   $4 billion.
[01:59:09.260 --> 01:59:10.660]   What does that mean?
[01:59:10.660 --> 01:59:15.580]   Well, it just means that the play is a hidden gem.
[01:59:15.580 --> 01:59:17.940]   It's going to make money for the company.
[01:59:17.940 --> 01:59:19.500]   But B, this says that--
[01:59:19.500 --> 01:59:22.020]   I write things that Google-- 98% of Google revenue
[01:59:22.020 --> 01:59:24.740]   is advertising true.
[01:59:24.740 --> 01:59:29.780]   And people think Facebook is moving ahead fast on mobile
[01:59:29.780 --> 01:59:35.660]   true, but Google is more mixed and diverse in its revenue
[01:59:35.660 --> 01:59:36.740]   than I would have thought.
[01:59:36.740 --> 01:59:38.900]   Yeah.
[01:59:38.900 --> 01:59:40.340]   That's good.
[01:59:40.340 --> 01:59:42.680]   So that whole content strategy--
[01:59:42.680 --> 01:59:43.420]   Working good.
[01:59:43.420 --> 01:59:52.020]   --even as search-- because they law Google lost Firefox.
[01:59:52.020 --> 01:59:55.300]   As the default search, it lost the market share.
[01:59:55.300 --> 02:00:00.780]   But you know, flee on the butt of the elephant.
[02:00:00.780 --> 02:00:03.460]   I got a crazy tool for you.
[02:00:03.460 --> 02:00:06.740]   When the HTC announced this little doohickey,
[02:00:06.740 --> 02:00:09.140]   we thought they were insane.
[02:00:09.140 --> 02:00:12.860]   This is the HTC R-E-R-E. It looks
[02:00:12.860 --> 02:00:15.700]   like a little periscope or an Asman-Hailer.
[02:00:15.700 --> 02:00:16.980]   Yeah, I thought it was a puffer, maybe.
[02:00:16.980 --> 02:00:20.820]   It looks like a puffer, but it's actually a camera.
[02:00:20.820 --> 02:00:22.620]   And it's kind of the logical successor
[02:00:22.620 --> 02:00:24.420]   to the Flipcam or something like that.
[02:00:24.420 --> 02:00:27.980]   Maybe it's not exactly a GoPro.
[02:00:27.980 --> 02:00:28.820]   It's a weird thing.
[02:00:28.820 --> 02:00:29.940]   But look here, I'll show you.
[02:00:29.940 --> 02:00:31.300]   If you can get the over-the-shoulder shot,
[02:00:31.300 --> 02:00:33.900]   it ties to Android or iOS.
[02:00:33.900 --> 02:00:36.260]   So I have a viewfinder here.
[02:00:36.260 --> 02:00:39.300]   Now, it's not great for stills, but it's actually
[02:00:39.300 --> 02:00:40.580]   kind of a decent movie camera.
[02:00:40.580 --> 02:00:42.580]   And because it just sits there, you
[02:00:42.580 --> 02:00:43.500]   don't need a tripod.
[02:00:43.500 --> 02:00:45.020]   It's really easy.
[02:00:45.020 --> 02:00:47.940]   And they added a feature, which I kind of think puts this
[02:00:47.940 --> 02:00:50.140]   over the top, makes it very interesting.
[02:00:50.140 --> 02:00:52.380]   Live YouTube streaming.
[02:00:52.380 --> 02:00:54.060]   So if I check this box--
[02:00:54.060 --> 02:00:56.340]   I've already set up my YouTube account to receive it--
[02:00:56.340 --> 02:00:57.900]   and press the record button--
[02:00:57.900 --> 02:01:01.980]   I am now streaming live on YouTube.
[02:01:01.980 --> 02:01:04.140]   I mean, talk about an interesting and simple way
[02:01:04.140 --> 02:01:06.380]   to start vlogging or--
[02:01:06.380 --> 02:01:06.820]   Wow.
[02:01:06.820 --> 02:01:07.980]   I don't know what.
[02:01:07.980 --> 02:01:09.380]   Is that out in the market now?
[02:01:09.380 --> 02:01:10.140]   Yeah.
[02:01:10.140 --> 02:01:11.020]   Now, it's pricey.
[02:01:11.020 --> 02:01:11.940]   In fact, it's overpriced.
[02:01:11.940 --> 02:01:13.820]   It's $179 on Amazon.
[02:01:13.820 --> 02:01:16.380]   I think $200 is the list.
[02:01:16.380 --> 02:01:18.980]   I wouldn't use it as a still camera, probably.
[02:01:18.980 --> 02:01:20.060]   In fact, I probably wouldn't--
[02:01:20.060 --> 02:01:22.020]   I don't even know if it was as a movie camera,
[02:01:22.020 --> 02:01:23.460]   it'd be that valuable.
[02:01:23.460 --> 02:01:28.500]   But it's really intriguing as a streamer.
[02:01:28.500 --> 02:01:31.860]   It's just like you could start vlogging instantly
[02:01:31.860 --> 02:01:34.820]   and create a YouTube--
[02:01:34.820 --> 02:01:35.660]   I don't know.
[02:01:35.660 --> 02:01:37.060]   I found this really intriguing.
[02:01:37.060 --> 02:01:39.300]   And I have to admit, I was skeptical about it.
[02:01:39.300 --> 02:01:41.100]   There's some cool features-- I'm going to review it fully
[02:01:41.100 --> 02:01:42.100]   on before you buy next week.
[02:01:42.100 --> 02:01:43.540]   But there's some cool features.
[02:01:43.540 --> 02:01:44.980]   One, it's always on.
[02:01:44.980 --> 02:01:46.780]   It's got a touch sensor in the body.
[02:01:46.780 --> 02:01:49.820]   So when you pick it up, it wakes up.
[02:01:49.820 --> 02:01:52.260]   So you can pick it up and take a picture right away
[02:01:52.260 --> 02:01:54.140]   just by pressing that button.
[02:01:54.140 --> 02:01:55.500]   So you're still streaming to YouTube?
[02:01:55.500 --> 02:01:57.060]   OK, so it finally came up on YouTube.
[02:01:57.060 --> 02:01:59.220]   It takes about 30 seconds to get going on YouTube.
[02:01:59.220 --> 02:01:59.820]   There we go.
[02:01:59.820 --> 02:02:03.700]   So if you go to my YouTube site, youtube.com/leo-l-report.
[02:02:03.700 --> 02:02:05.460]   Yeah, it took a little bit to appear.
[02:02:05.460 --> 02:02:06.980]   What's the most delightful lag as I have on the show?
[02:02:06.980 --> 02:02:08.620]   Well, it has to encode and stream,
[02:02:08.620 --> 02:02:09.820]   and YouTube has to receive it.
[02:02:09.820 --> 02:02:11.620]   It's using YouTube Live.
[02:02:11.620 --> 02:02:12.420]   Oh, is it not?
[02:02:12.420 --> 02:02:13.340]   Come on, YouTube.
[02:02:13.340 --> 02:02:14.340]   Come on, YouTube.
[02:02:14.340 --> 02:02:15.300]   We believe in you.
[02:02:15.300 --> 02:02:16.700]   You can only-- there you go.
[02:02:16.700 --> 02:02:19.780]   It's only three half an hour at a time.
[02:02:19.780 --> 02:02:20.460]   Audio's pretty good.
[02:02:20.460 --> 02:02:21.460]   Listen.
[02:02:21.460 --> 02:02:22.300]   I don't know.
[02:02:22.300 --> 02:02:24.460]   I found this really intriguing, and I have to admit,
[02:02:24.460 --> 02:02:25.900]   I was skeptical about it.
[02:02:25.900 --> 02:02:26.660]   There's some cool features.
[02:02:26.660 --> 02:02:27.300]   I'm going to have--
[02:02:27.300 --> 02:02:28.060]   Sounds good, doesn't it?
[02:02:28.060 --> 02:02:28.940]   What about you by next week?
[02:02:28.940 --> 02:02:29.860]   I could do video.
[02:02:29.860 --> 02:02:31.220]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[02:02:31.220 --> 02:02:34.380]   So does it record in its own memory, or does it--
[02:02:34.380 --> 02:02:35.220]   Yeah, you have it.
[02:02:35.220 --> 02:02:37.540]   It comes with an SD card, 8G, SD card.
[02:02:37.540 --> 02:02:41.580]   You can put up to 128 gig micro SD in it.
[02:02:41.580 --> 02:02:43.780]   So it has plenty of recording space.
[02:02:43.780 --> 02:02:46.980]   But you tie it to your smartphone with their re-app,
[02:02:46.980 --> 02:02:50.500]   and then you've got a viewfinder and the ability to stream.
[02:02:50.500 --> 02:02:51.900]   It streams through this, right?
[02:02:51.900 --> 02:02:53.260]   Streams through the phone.
[02:02:53.260 --> 02:02:55.100]   It works much better on Wi-Fi.
[02:02:55.100 --> 02:02:59.580]   Wasn't really able to do much streaming on LTE.
[02:02:59.580 --> 02:03:02.980]   But very interesting.
[02:03:02.980 --> 02:03:04.380]   So I got a gadget to leave.
[02:03:04.380 --> 02:03:05.820]   All right.
[02:03:05.820 --> 02:03:08.420]   I decided I asked myself, what's the most obnoxious thing
[02:03:08.420 --> 02:03:09.860]   that I could do?
[02:03:09.860 --> 02:03:12.100]   I can take a selfie stick.
[02:03:12.100 --> 02:03:13.860]   Oh, no.
[02:03:13.860 --> 02:03:16.580]   The selfie stick.
[02:03:16.580 --> 02:03:18.940]   That's technically called the wand of narcissus.
[02:03:18.940 --> 02:03:21.180]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:03:21.180 --> 02:03:24.220]   Don't stroke your wand of narcissus there.
[02:03:24.220 --> 02:03:26.300]   I was going around Davos with a selfie stick
[02:03:26.300 --> 02:03:28.540]   would be the most obnoxious thing I could do.
[02:03:28.540 --> 02:03:29.820]   So I got that.
[02:03:29.820 --> 02:03:34.220]   Well, let me just point out that the re has a tripod thread
[02:03:34.220 --> 02:03:38.140]   in the bottom, and it will work with a selfie stick as well.
[02:03:38.140 --> 02:03:44.180]   And so I think I might put this on a selfie stick too.
[02:03:44.180 --> 02:03:46.580]   Or just-- it just kind of naturally follows you around.
[02:03:46.580 --> 02:03:47.540]   Look at that.
[02:03:47.540 --> 02:03:48.900]   You need a selfie stick.
[02:03:48.900 --> 02:03:50.100]   You've seen that.
[02:03:50.100 --> 02:03:51.700]   The butt selfie stick?
[02:03:51.700 --> 02:03:52.260]   Yeah.
[02:03:52.260 --> 02:03:53.620]   It has a little angle.
[02:03:53.620 --> 02:03:54.220]   Let's try it.
[02:03:54.220 --> 02:03:55.260]   Let's just see.
[02:03:55.260 --> 02:03:57.700]   Here's my selfie stick.
[02:03:57.700 --> 02:04:00.020]   I got one too, Jarvis.
[02:04:00.020 --> 02:04:01.020]   Oh, man.
[02:04:01.020 --> 02:04:04.300]   I got one too.
[02:04:04.300 --> 02:04:05.420]   Now.
[02:04:05.420 --> 02:04:08.500]   Now how much would you pay?
[02:04:08.500 --> 02:04:09.900]   Close this whole studio down.
[02:04:09.900 --> 02:04:10.620]   You're all fired.
[02:04:10.620 --> 02:04:15.780]   I've got everything I need with my selfie stick and my HTC RE.
[02:04:15.780 --> 02:04:21.540]   It'd be better if it had an extendable on the actual camera.
[02:04:21.540 --> 02:04:23.940]   It should be its own selfie stick.
[02:04:23.940 --> 02:04:26.420]   Or like a flex head that could move around?
[02:04:26.420 --> 02:04:30.300]   It's got-- inside, it's got a battery that goes about an hour
[02:04:30.300 --> 02:04:33.180]   and a half, but you can get an extended battery.
[02:04:33.180 --> 02:04:35.700]   And as I said, the YouTube stream is limited probably
[02:04:35.700 --> 02:04:38.980]   because of Google to 30 minutes.
[02:04:38.980 --> 02:04:40.460]   But I don't know.
[02:04:40.460 --> 02:04:41.300]   It's kind of funny.
[02:04:41.300 --> 02:04:41.800]   Good.
[02:04:41.800 --> 02:04:44.700]   So when are you going to Davos, Mr. J?
[02:04:44.700 --> 02:04:46.140]   Next week.
[02:04:46.140 --> 02:04:47.860]   So will you be here from Davos?
[02:04:47.860 --> 02:04:49.300]   What are we going to do?
[02:04:49.300 --> 02:04:52.060]   I think that's going to-- I hate to leave you.
[02:04:52.060 --> 02:04:54.820]   It's going to be-- soon it's going to be a one-person show.
[02:04:54.820 --> 02:04:55.740]   Yes, so you know me.
[02:04:55.740 --> 02:04:56.240]   I know.
[02:04:56.240 --> 02:04:58.420]   But the problem is they have me doing that dinner
[02:04:58.420 --> 02:04:59.460]   until 10 o'clock.
[02:04:59.460 --> 02:05:00.140]   Yeah, that's all right.
[02:05:00.140 --> 02:05:01.420]   The show start.
[02:05:01.420 --> 02:05:02.180]   That's all right.
[02:05:02.180 --> 02:05:03.380]   Up the street.
[02:05:03.380 --> 02:05:05.460]   So Matthew, can you come next week too?
[02:05:05.460 --> 02:05:10.020]   Leo, I'm happy to do it, and I never go anywhere.
[02:05:10.020 --> 02:05:11.300]   We love you, Matthew.
[02:05:11.300 --> 02:05:11.940]   We love you.
[02:05:11.940 --> 02:05:14.680]   And you have no chance-- no plans to have a baby any time
[02:05:14.680 --> 02:05:15.680]   in the near future.
[02:05:15.680 --> 02:05:16.500]   Not to my knowledge.
[02:05:16.500 --> 02:05:17.900]   Or a startup.
[02:05:17.900 --> 02:05:18.300]   No.
[02:05:18.300 --> 02:05:19.220]   OK.
[02:05:19.220 --> 02:05:20.940]   I'm not getting a selfie stick either.
[02:05:20.940 --> 02:05:22.680]   And he's not getting a selfie stick either.
[02:05:22.680 --> 02:05:23.940]   Matthew Ingram, we love Matthew.
[02:05:23.940 --> 02:05:27.700]   That would be very uncadamian to have a selfie stick, yes.
[02:05:27.700 --> 02:05:28.620]   You know why I love him.
[02:05:28.620 --> 02:05:30.180]   Apparently, they're coming to the United States.
[02:05:30.180 --> 02:05:32.340]   This is going to be the summer of the selfie stick in the US.
[02:05:32.340 --> 02:05:34.460]   Oh, no.
[02:05:34.460 --> 02:05:36.420]   I saw him all over Europe.
[02:05:36.420 --> 02:05:37.260]   Yeah, they're everywhere.
[02:05:37.260 --> 02:05:38.340]   Yeah.
[02:05:38.340 --> 02:05:39.620]   Matthew writes for Gigahome.
[02:05:39.620 --> 02:05:40.420]   He is the guy.
[02:05:40.420 --> 02:05:42.020]   You got to read him, gigahome.com.
[02:05:42.020 --> 02:05:43.380]   I'm sorry, Matthew?
[02:05:43.380 --> 02:05:44.800]   Look at the oatmeal.
[02:05:44.800 --> 02:05:46.120]   Did a selfie stick.
[02:05:46.120 --> 02:05:47.960]   Should you buy a selfie stick?
[02:05:47.960 --> 02:05:48.800]   I love you.
[02:05:48.800 --> 02:05:49.300]   I love you.
[02:05:49.300 --> 02:05:51.440]   Matthew Ingram is--
[02:05:51.440 --> 02:05:52.560]   Is he any relation to you?
[02:05:52.560 --> 02:05:53.680]   Matthew Ingram?
[02:05:53.680 --> 02:05:54.640]   Ingram?
[02:05:54.640 --> 02:05:55.200]   Inman, no.
[02:05:55.200 --> 02:05:56.600]   Inman, Ingram?
[02:05:56.600 --> 02:05:59.560]   All people named Matthew are not related.
[02:05:59.560 --> 02:06:03.960]   Yeah, but Inman and Ingram, practically your brother.
[02:06:03.960 --> 02:06:04.560]   No, you're right.
[02:06:04.560 --> 02:06:06.200]   That doesn't make any sense at all.
[02:06:06.200 --> 02:06:07.480]   There it is.
[02:06:07.480 --> 02:06:10.920]   Should you buy a selfie stick writes the oatmeal,
[02:06:10.920 --> 02:06:12.640]   a handy guide for shoppers?
[02:06:12.640 --> 02:06:15.700]   Have you completely given up on life?
[02:06:15.700 --> 02:06:17.540]   Yes, you should buy a selfie stick.
[02:06:17.540 --> 02:06:18.940]   No.
[02:06:18.940 --> 02:06:21.280]   Are you Japanese?
[02:06:21.280 --> 02:06:23.020]   Yes, you should buy a selfie stick.
[02:06:23.020 --> 02:06:26.060]   No, you should not buy a selfie stick.
[02:06:26.060 --> 02:06:27.220]   It's a simple decision tree.
[02:06:27.220 --> 02:06:30.100]   My favorite is the little arrow at the bottom of the drawing.
[02:06:30.100 --> 02:06:30.620]   Yeah.
[02:06:30.620 --> 02:06:31.120]   What?
[02:06:31.120 --> 02:06:31.620]   You can just scroll down.
[02:06:31.620 --> 02:06:32.820]   You can just cross.
[02:06:32.820 --> 02:06:33.820]   Crocs.
[02:06:33.820 --> 02:06:36.100]   Oh, I wear crocs too.
[02:06:36.100 --> 02:06:36.780]   Crocs are great.
[02:06:36.780 --> 02:06:38.540]   What's wrong with crocs?
[02:06:38.540 --> 02:06:41.420]   I actually think selfie sticks are an interim technology,
[02:06:41.420 --> 02:06:44.220]   and soon we'll have little mini drones that
[02:06:44.220 --> 02:06:46.380]   can take a picture from Italy.
[02:06:46.380 --> 02:06:48.620]   I ordered a drone too.
[02:06:48.620 --> 02:06:51.580]   I am Mr. With It.
[02:06:51.580 --> 02:06:54.220]   I would like a drone.
[02:06:54.220 --> 02:06:55.660]   Yeah, I'll send you one.
[02:06:55.660 --> 02:06:56.020]   OK.
[02:06:56.020 --> 02:06:56.860]   Put your camera on it.
[02:06:56.860 --> 02:06:59.020]   And you'll be looking up the whole time you did the show.
[02:06:59.020 --> 02:06:59.580]   And a mini.
[02:06:59.580 --> 02:07:00.980]   Do you want to put it in the same package?
[02:07:00.980 --> 02:07:03.100]   Put it in with the Mac mini, absolutely.
[02:07:03.100 --> 02:07:05.500]   Matthew Ingram, you go home.com.
[02:07:05.500 --> 02:07:09.540]   You have to have a drone camera for the show.
[02:07:09.540 --> 02:07:10.040]   We do.
[02:07:10.040 --> 02:07:12.680]   But I don't know doing it inside if it's a good idea.
[02:07:12.680 --> 02:07:13.340]   Oh, yeah.
[02:07:13.340 --> 02:07:14.140]   It's just great.
[02:07:14.140 --> 02:07:16.180]   What could go wrong?
[02:07:16.180 --> 02:07:19.180]   Leo, Leo, you had a fire dancer inside.
[02:07:19.180 --> 02:07:20.620]   That's true.
[02:07:20.620 --> 02:07:21.780]   You saw that.
[02:07:21.780 --> 02:07:23.340]   You were there.
[02:07:23.340 --> 02:07:25.060]   I smelled it.
[02:07:25.060 --> 02:07:27.980]   We had to leave because the kerosene was so--
[02:07:27.980 --> 02:07:29.420]   But she was great.
[02:07:29.420 --> 02:07:32.100]   She was great.
[02:07:32.100 --> 02:07:34.260]   Jeff Jarvis is at the City University of New York.
[02:07:34.260 --> 02:07:36.100]   We call it CUNY.
[02:07:36.100 --> 02:07:38.140]   And he also blogs at Buzzmachine.com.
[02:07:38.140 --> 02:07:39.040]   And he's on Twitter.
[02:07:39.040 --> 02:07:41.440]   And he's on Google+, and his latest book--
[02:07:41.440 --> 02:07:44.480]   Soon I'll be on a Mac.
[02:07:44.480 --> 02:07:46.000]   We'll send you a-- we'll talk.
[02:07:46.000 --> 02:07:47.680]   I'll get John to talk to you.
[02:07:47.680 --> 02:07:51.400]   And we'll get you an appropriate piece of hardware.
[02:07:51.400 --> 02:07:52.960]   We would love to replace Skype.
[02:07:52.960 --> 02:07:54.880]   It's not that we're in love with Skype.
[02:07:54.880 --> 02:07:58.480]   But just the only thing that seems to work reliably, alas.
[02:07:58.480 --> 02:08:01.080]   Well, I should have restarted the machine right before the show.
[02:08:01.080 --> 02:08:01.720]   I learned that.
[02:08:01.720 --> 02:08:03.040]   It's pretty good now.
[02:08:03.040 --> 02:08:03.840]   It's settled down.
[02:08:03.840 --> 02:08:04.480]   Yeah, it's better.
[02:08:04.480 --> 02:08:06.880]   And I closed everything on the machine.
[02:08:06.880 --> 02:08:08.040]   That's the key.
[02:08:08.040 --> 02:08:11.060]   Nothing else can be going on.
[02:08:11.060 --> 02:08:13.500]   We do this week in Google every Wednesday.
[02:08:13.500 --> 02:08:14.600]   I love this selfie stick.
[02:08:14.600 --> 02:08:16.000]   I'm just going to keep using this.
[02:08:16.000 --> 02:08:20.100]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:08:20.100 --> 02:08:23.600]   I made for you, Mr. J.
[02:08:23.600 --> 02:08:25.900]   I love narcissists' wand.
[02:08:25.900 --> 02:08:28.060]   We do this week in Google every Wednesday, 1 PM
[02:08:28.060 --> 02:08:30.180]   Pacific, 4 PM Eastern time.
[02:08:30.180 --> 02:08:31.740]   That would be 2100 UTC.
[02:08:31.740 --> 02:08:33.860]   You can watch live.twit.tv.
[02:08:33.860 --> 02:08:34.980]   You can join us in studio.
[02:08:34.980 --> 02:08:35.500]   We love that.
[02:08:35.500 --> 02:08:36.580]   Tickets at twit.tv.
[02:08:36.580 --> 02:08:38.820]   Just email us so we put a chair out for you.
[02:08:38.820 --> 02:08:41.540]   But if you can't watch or be here, well, of course,
[02:08:41.540 --> 02:08:44.140]   you can always download audio and video after the fact.
[02:08:44.140 --> 02:08:47.700]   Twit.tv/twig is the website.
[02:08:47.700 --> 02:08:49.420]   But you can also find this week in Google.
[02:08:49.420 --> 02:08:53.460]   And everywhere you can find podcasts, iTunes, and all the aggregators.
[02:08:53.460 --> 02:08:55.700]   And on a newly released--
[02:08:55.700 --> 02:08:56.260]   we didn't do it.
[02:08:56.260 --> 02:08:57.940]   But thank you, Mark, for doing it.
[02:08:57.940 --> 02:09:01.780]   Mark Hanson did a beautiful job of--
[02:09:01.780 --> 02:09:02.380]   what is it called?
[02:09:02.380 --> 02:09:03.300]   Twit-Droid?
[02:09:03.300 --> 02:09:04.180]   It's for-- it's the--
[02:09:04.180 --> 02:09:04.860]   Twit Pro?
[02:09:04.860 --> 02:09:05.980]   Twit Pro for Android.
[02:09:05.980 --> 02:09:06.480]   Yeah.
[02:09:06.480 --> 02:09:08.060]   3.0 just came out.
[02:09:08.060 --> 02:09:11.340]   There are actually several Android apps, several iOS apps.
[02:09:11.340 --> 02:09:13.020]   Thanks to Shifki Software.
[02:09:13.020 --> 02:09:14.900]   They do a great iOS app.
[02:09:14.900 --> 02:09:16.540]   They also did our Roku app.
[02:09:16.540 --> 02:09:18.100]   These are all independent third party developers
[02:09:18.100 --> 02:09:21.540]   who work very hard and do a great job,
[02:09:21.540 --> 02:09:23.980]   making it easy for you to watch wherever you are.
[02:09:23.980 --> 02:09:24.820]   Thanks for being here.
[02:09:24.820 --> 02:09:26.940]   We'll see you next time on Twig.
[02:09:26.940 --> 02:09:29.940]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:09:29.940 --> 02:09:33.280]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:09:33.280 --> 02:09:35.860]   (upbeat music)
[02:09:35.860 --> 02:09:38.440]   (soothing music)
