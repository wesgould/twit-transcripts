[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   Time for Twig this week in Google, the show where we cover the latest news
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   and I should warn you anything else we want to talk about.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.500]   But that's why I love this show.
[00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.500]   It's a deep philosophical dive into technology and society starring Jeff Jarvis,
[00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.500]   professor of journalism.
[00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.500]   And Gutenberg.
[00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:07.500]   Gutenberg.
[00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.500]   Gutenberg.
[00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:09.500]   Gutenberg.
[00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.500]   Jeff is a professor of journalism at the CUNY City University of New York.
[00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.500]   He is there in his office right now, blogs@buzzmachine.com
[00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.000]   and his latest geek-sparing news about reinventing the news business.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:27.500]   Gutenberg, the geek, a bit of historical deep dive into why things are the way they are.
[00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:28.500]   What would Google do?
[00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.500]   Public parts.
[00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:30.500]   Great to have you Jeff.
[00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:31.500]   He was on Twitch.
[00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:32.500]   A great episode of Twitch.
[00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.500]   I love being at the growing up table.
[00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.500]   I got to have wine with a turkey.
[00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:37.500]   Yeah.
[00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.500]   Lots of fun.
[00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:39.500]   Lots of fun.
[00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.500]   What are you going to take?
[00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.500]   And that is Kevin Marks.
[00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.500]   KevinMarks.com at KevinMarks on the Twitter.
[00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.500]   Manabout Silicon Valley.
[00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.500]   He's been everywhere man.
[00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.500]   Started the BBC.
[00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.500]   He was hired by Apple to work on QuickTime and podcasting
[00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.500]   before he had anybody even have a name.
[00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.500]   He also worked at his work at Google, British Telecom, and he joins us regularly.
[00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:04.500]   Great to have you, Kevin.
[00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.500]   In fact, I'm really glad you're here.
[00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.500]   Jeff, you went this morning to the Google event announcing there.
[00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:17.500]   Now, see, this is funny because it's been kind of framed as Google's response to Facebook
[00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.500]   news and Apple news.
[00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.500]   But it doesn't sound like that's what it is.
[00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:23.500]   What is AMP?
[00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.500]   So let me back up and just give a tad of history here.
[00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:35.500]   I went to an event in Helsinki in May, Google Newsgeist with the digital news initiative
[00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.500]   in Google, and you know about news in Google and Europe.
[00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.500]   And it was about a week after Instant Articles was out.
[00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.500]   And I, for one, being an obnoxious SOB walked in and said, "You've been leapfrogged by a mile.
[00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.500]   What you people should do is do an open source version of Instant Articles."
[00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:50.500]   And this is not what caused me to do it.
[00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.500]   I'm not trying to say a ticket credit for that.
[00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.500]   But Richard Jinger has had Google News.
[00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.500]   There has also been arguing, as I have for quite some time, for this idea, portable content.
[00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.500]   That content can travel with its brand, revenue, analytics, and links attached.
[00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.500]   And that's a good thing.
[00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.500]   Well, lo and behold, Richard worked with Dave Besbres, the VP of Engineering at Google,
[00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.500]   and the digital news initiative and others.
[00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:18.500]   And what they announced today was, in some sense, yes, a response to Instant Articles,
[00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:19.500]   in that sense.
[00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.500]   However, the fact that it does news first is almost coincidental.
[00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:29.500]   Because what this really, really, really does is go to Google's obsession about speeding up the web.
[00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.500]   And they're starting with news publishers because that's a nice controlled environment
[00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.500]   of people who want quality, and they can make nice with publishers, and so on and so forth.
[00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.500]   But what this is, is actually fairly straightforward.
[00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:47.500]   Number one, it's going to make it so that when you click a link from an app,
[00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:51.500]   from Twitter, from a web page, from whatever, it's especially aimed at mobile,
[00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.500]   but this works the same on the web.
[00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.500]   Although, it's, "Amp" stands for Accelerated Mobile Pages.
[00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.500]   They just have to make care of it, because everybody, all they care about is mobile.
[00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:59.500]   But it's just the web.
[00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:02.500]   All this you're hearing about is just the web.
[00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.500]   So it's nothing.
[00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.500]   So what is the standard that does a few things?
[00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.500]   When you click on it, the page will come up instantly.
[00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:09.500]   How will it do that?
[00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:16.500]   Number one, there's a shared library of architectural functions, you know, how to do a slideshow,
[00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.500]   how to do other things, that the sites that are AMP ready agree to, and they use that.
[00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.500]   So that now, of course, when you click on a link, what has to happen?
[00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:23.500]   It has to open a browser.
[00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:29.500]   It has to open all the crap, and all the crap around the page, plus a bunch of crappy ads,
[00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:30.500]   which we'll cut to in a second.
[00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.500]   And then, by the way, here comes the content.
[00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:33.500]   And it takes friggin' forever.
[00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.500]   So a link is an invitation to wait.
[00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:40.500]   So now, the shared library makes it simpler and easier for the page to come up quickly.
[00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:41.500]   And this is an open library.
[00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.500]   It's not a template, but it's a way to, uh,
[00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:50.500]   call on those resources so that you don't have to reload them every time the poor user loads
[00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.500]   the page, when they're the same things, everybody else uses anyway.
[00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:54.500]   That's one.
[00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.500]   Two, it's an open cache.
[00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:58.500]   So it can be cached in a number of ways.
[00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:01.500]   It can be cached by Google itself, which offers, but that's not mandatory.
[00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:04.500]   Anybody else can set up a cache as well.
[00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:06.500]   And in a sense, it's also cached.
[00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.500]   It's prefetched onto your app.
[00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:13.500]   So if you're in a carousel, it's starting to fetch the next page, so it'll happen quickly.
[00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:18.500]   Number three, it sets certain ad standards.
[00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:23.500]   I think this is a hidden big story out of this is that anything that's going to mess up
[00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:25.500]   the learning of the page, you know what?
[00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:29.500]   What we all hate, and Beth talked about this from Google, is you load the page and then
[00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:31.500]   it goes up, up, down, up, down, up, down, up, down, up.
[00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.500]   Well, it's trying to figure out the architecture and load in the ads.
[00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:36.500]   Uh, uh, it has to have a set size to the ad and it has to go in.
[00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:39.500]   No pop ups, no other nasty things.
[00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:42.500]   So it's just the bare beginning of ad standards, which I think is important.
[00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:46.500]   And so it loads in such a way that the content will load instantly.
[00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:49.500]   The ads at the top of the page will load first.
[00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:53.500]   They will load live, uh, so that you know, you're paying the server.
[00:06:53.500 --> 00:07:00.500]   But then as you go on, it'll load and it won't just, it won't interrupt with you trying to see the page and read it immediately.
[00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:06.500]   Number four, from my understanding, um, is, and this wasn't talked about at the press event,
[00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:10.500]   but I talked afterwards, a few of us were asking Beth's questions, including Daddy Sullivan.
[00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:15.500]   Uh, who by the way, when Daddy Sullivan's at an event, don't bother tweeting because he gets it all and he gets it right.
[00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:22.500]   Um, you've got, so number four, which I think is interesting is that Bez said that, um, you know, every publishers love analytics.
[00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:28.500]   They all have all the analytics and all the analytics are checking every damn second to say, did he scroll? Did he scroll? Did he scroll?
[00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:30.500]   And it's causing all kinds of problems.
[00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:39.500]   So now there's a shared analytics gathering engine, basically, that can feed off and it can do Google analytics and it can do, um, and it can do chart beat and so on and so on.
[00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:44.500]   And, and, and parsley and so on and so forth, but you will not have all these separate things there doing that.
[00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:50.500]   So you add all that together. And what happens is that it makes the page load extremely quickly.
[00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:53.500]   And the page, keep in mind, is just a web page.
[00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:58.500]   Uh, this is not about changing the web. This is not about Google being an intermediary.
[00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:02.500]   This is an open standard. You don't have to go through Google in any way. They just offer their caching.
[00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:09.500]   A whole bunch of publishers from the New York Times to box to BuzzFeed to the Guardian to the Telegraph to German publishers.
[00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:16.500]   You know, are the first in there's 5,000 articles a day that are that are so far going up in this format, this AMP format.
[00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:22.500]   And it just simply makes it a hell of a lot faster and makes the mobile experience better.
[00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:24.500]   So I'm almost done, but a few more points.
[00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:30.500]   Um, what happens then is that if you're in, in, in Twitter and such,
[00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:33.500]   uh, when you click on a link, boom, the page is there.
[00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:39.500]   Now, to me, this changes pretty radically the potential experience you could have, uh,
[00:08:39.500 --> 00:08:45.500]   in the sense that an aggregator like Nuzzle or like an aggregated app like Nuzzle or a site,
[00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:50.500]   real clear politics, the experience has been you click on a link and boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:54.500]   Wait, now you click on a link and Bingo, it'll be there.
[00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:57.500]   And so it'll be more like a web experience at those places.
[00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:03.500]   And I think this has huge implications for the idea of distributing the content that less than less people will come to our sites.
[00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:05.500]   More and more, we will go to them.
[00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:09.500]   Same as incident articles on Facebook to make it faster.
[00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:16.500]   Maybe it's a Trojan horse, but to make it faster, that's why people are going to put Washington Post is going to put up every single article it has on the Facebook.
[00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:22.500]   There too, the publishers and for faith, you can get Facebook to sell for you.
[00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:24.500]   And we're going to go to where the readers are.
[00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:26.500]   I think more and more and more.
[00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:31.500]   And so that's in a nutshell what happens.
[00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:39.500]   What it doesn't do is bring you back data about the users beyond the analytics that you capture.
[00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:43.500]   And I think that's important from the likes of Facebook.
[00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:51.500]   It is different from Facebook and articles, but there's no reason that they couldn't bring those two things together into a standard.
[00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:56.500]   When you publish something that's amp ready, it's also as articles ready, or vice versa.
[00:09:56.500 --> 00:09:58.500]   I think that would be a very exciting thing to happen.
[00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:05.500]   I think Facebook could leapfrog Google here by giving more data back to publishers to help them be smarter about what they do.
[00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:12.500]   But I think this is an incredibly important change in the architecture of how we do content.
[00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:14.500]   And it makes all Google says they want to do.
[00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:15.500]   Finally, to answer your question.
[00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:24.500]   I think what happened here was not, I think Dave Bespers, like Google, is obsessed with making the web faster and faster and faster.
[00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:28.500]   And if it was new publishers, somebody else, you know, in a sense, who cares?
[00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:32.500]   What they want is a better web experience, a faster web experience, they want to get rid of the delays.
[00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:35.500]   And so they're starting with the publishers because they also want to make nice with publishers.
[00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:39.500]   But the truth is this should be true of any web page out there eventually.
[00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:40.500]   But now it's a standard.
[00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:41.500]   It's open.
[00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:42.500]   It's on GitHub.
[00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:47.500]   And so, yeah, it starts with news.
[00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:52.500]   And yes, I think that the impetus to get this thing going and get it done so quickly is the news initiative.
[00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:56.500]   But it's also just flat out a better web initiative.
[00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:58.500]   That's what I have to report.
[00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:05.500]   Now, fortunately, we have Kevin March here, who is a fighter for web standards.
[00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:07.500]   It's been from day one.
[00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:14.500]   And also, fortunately enough of a technical expert that he can look at a GitHub repository and know what Google's proposing here.
[00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:18.500]   Because that's what Jeff, what you expressed is what Google said.
[00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:23.500]   But of course, what we'd like to know is what it really does.
[00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:28.500]   It looks to me a little bit, Kevin, like just a set of best practices.
[00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:36.500]   I'm looking at band HTML, you know, no more frames, no more forms, no more embeds, no more stuff.
[00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:38.500]   No more shared resources.
[00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:40.500]   No more shared resources and caching.
[00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:49.500]   Yeah, and I understand the caching and the shared resources is to speed up and preloading too, which is maybe not such a best practice to speed up browsing.
[00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:51.500]   But so that's one part of it.
[00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:53.500]   It still is HTML, but it's a subset.
[00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:55.500]   It's still CSS, but it's a subset.
[00:11:55.500 --> 00:12:00.500]   And then it's some JavaScript from Google too, right?
[00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:01.500]   Right.
[00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:04.500]   But no JavaScript, nobody else knows they blessed, which is the issue.
[00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:05.500]   Yeah.
[00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:06.500]   So part of that is --
[00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:12.500]   By the way, is the JavaScript from Google part of the open stuff in GitHub?
[00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:14.500]   I mean, can I examine that JavaScript?
[00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:15.500]   Yeah.
[00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:16.500]   Okay.
[00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:18.500]   So there's nothing secret going on here.
[00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:20.500]   Well, there's a little bit of secret.
[00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:21.500]   I'll get to that.
[00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:28.500]   So the broad goal here is laudable in that it is trying to get rid of lots of JavaScript craft.
[00:12:28.500 --> 00:12:38.500]   And my friend, Tantec, has this thing a JSDR, which means JavaScript didn't read, which is like too long, didn't read.
[00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:44.500]   And he deliberately runs his browser with JavaScript off so that all the pages that take forever to load go away.
[00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:50.500]   And that, you know, so to some extent, this is, you know, taking that on board.
[00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:58.500]   And additionally, I know how much of -- I know you've been following Marco and the ad blocking in peace and all that stuff.
[00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:07.500]   The interesting thing that Marco said in his podcast about that was that the simplest thing that you can do to speed up the web is to block third-party JavaScript.
[00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:19.500]   Because that's basically -- any JavaScript not loaded from the site that you're on is probably external ad network staff, and that is the stuff that is slowing down the web by loading megabytes of nonsense.
[00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:33.500]   And all these scripts that follow every click of your mouse and every hover and doing all the sort of scary ad tech stuff, which is the ad tech equivalent of junk bonds or whatever.
[00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:35.500]   So this does that.
[00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:39.500]   It does say, okay, no JavaScript in this page.
[00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:43.500]   And then it says, "Accept special JavaScript to prove by Google."
[00:13:43.500 --> 00:13:58.500]   Now, you know, Google are good at writing JavaScript. They're good at this stuff. So they've done some -- they've done a streamline thing there that they're caching that JavaScript so that it runs so that you load it once, have many sites you go to doing that kind of thing.
[00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:07.500]   Some of the other things they've done -- but what it means is it won't even let you load JavaScript from your own site, which is a bit weird.
[00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:12.500]   So I took one of my pages and marked it up to dry this out.
[00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:14.500]   Only you could do that, Kevin.
[00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:20.500]   They give you a little JavaScript you can run to say, "Am I compliant?"
[00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:22.500]   And what's compliant?
[00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:24.500]   I'm trying that. I can't actually tell.
[00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:31.500]   Well, as I said, I was just doing this as we were getting on the air, so I'm not sure I completely got this right yet.
[00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:34.500]   But I'll put the link in.
[00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:40.500]   So this is my page, which was my quick reaction to AMP.
[00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:42.500]   Let me load this up.
[00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:44.500]   Let me put it in the right way. I see that.
[00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:45.500]   That would help, wouldn't it?
[00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:47.500]   Are you putting an IRC?
[00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:48.500]   I'll put it in an IRC.
[00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:49.500]   Okay.
[00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:51.500]   And I'll go back then to the GitHub.
[00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:52.500]   Mm-hmm.
[00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:59.500]   Because on the first blush, I don't even see the word "news" in this.
[00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:05.500]   This is just really more a platform for doing better, more complete pages.
[00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:09.500]   Although if you ban my JavaScript, it also means that my site's never going to work in this.
[00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:11.500]   This is so I don't...
[00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:21.500]   Yes, it basically means that they're trying to do it JavaScript-free web, but it also means that they get to approve what JavaScript runs.
[00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:24.500]   Now, that's somewhat draconian.
[00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:32.500]   For the New Sites, for the New York Times, for the people who are mired in megabytes of ad junk, that's a good thing.
[00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:34.500]   But it does undermine my site.
[00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:35.500]   So this is my site.
[00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:38.500]   This loaded very fast, including the Twitter embeds.
[00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:39.500]   Yep.
[00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:44.500]   You're allowed to use fonts, right?
[00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:47.500]   But it has to be Google fonts, which is also a little bit of...
[00:15:47.500 --> 00:15:49.500]   Oh, well, I'm just using System Fonts anyway.
[00:15:49.500 --> 00:15:50.500]   Okay.
[00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:51.500]   So my font...
[00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:52.500]   I don't use fontface.
[00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:59.500]   I just use a list of fonts that will render differently, whether you're on Mac or Android or whatever, because I'm not precious about fonts.
[00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:02.500]   But the...
[00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:05.500]   I did an AMP version down the bottom.
[00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:07.500]   And I haven't actually finished this.
[00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:09.500]   There's an AMP version that JavaScript removed.
[00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:13.500]   The AMP version, if I click through that, you lose the Twitter embeds.
[00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:17.500]   Now, they've got a way of embedding tweets, which I haven't got round to editing into.
[00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:19.500]   You just can't use the embed command.
[00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:20.500]   Yeah.
[00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:21.500]   So...
[00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:22.500]   You will.
[00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:27.500]   The way Twitter works is that you use block quotes to embed them, so you see something there.
[00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:32.500]   But then it runs JavaScript to decorate them so that they look pretty again.
[00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:41.500]   What I'm not sure is whether this is actually being tested properly yet, because as I said, I just started doing this half an hour before we went on the air.
[00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:45.500]   But in principle, this should work as an AMP thing.
[00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:48.500]   So maybe if we link to it from Twitter, it'll load in an AMP.
[00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:51.500]   But as part of it, it's hard to tell.
[00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:54.500]   And also, with my pages, it's hard to tell anyway, because there's not much markup on them.
[00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:57.500]   So I think loading time difference is going to be nominal here.
[00:16:57.500 --> 00:16:58.500]   It did load.
[00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:00.500]   Your page load very fast in both cases, obviously.
[00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:08.500]   Well, importantly, pretty much the difference on a web browser, on a computer web browser, is not going to be terribly noticeable.
[00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:09.500]   As mobile.
[00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:10.500]   Yeah.
[00:17:10.500 --> 00:17:13.500]   Because mobile is where it's more constrained, more difficult for all the reasons we know.
[00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:14.500]   Yeah.
[00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:23.500]   I mean, if you go, it might be worthwhile, you know, to show, if you go to the demo page on mobile, that's where you can really get a sense of what they're trying to do.
[00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:24.500]   Yes.
[00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:25.500]   AMP.
[00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:26.500]   project.org or...
[00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:27.500]   No, if you go to...
[00:17:27.500 --> 00:17:28.500]   Go to Kevin's...
[00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:34.500]   Go on g.co/ampdemo on your mobile phone.
[00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:36.500]   G.CO.
[00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:37.500]   Use Chrome.
[00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:38.500]   I'm using Chrome.
[00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:39.500]   It works on others, but yeah.
[00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:40.500]   Yeah.
[00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:42.500]   Then you go to the search for the right type, don't you?
[00:17:42.500 --> 00:17:44.500]   Search for Obama once you're there.
[00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:47.500]   Oh, so this is a version of Google?
[00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:48.500]   Yes.
[00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:49.500]   In AMP.
[00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:50.500]   In AMP.
[00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:51.500]   Okay.
[00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:52.500]   In the news tab and search for Google.
[00:17:52.500 --> 00:17:53.500]   Go to the news tab.
[00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:55.500]   We search search for search for Obama.
[00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:57.500]   Just use to search.
[00:17:57.500 --> 00:17:58.500]   There's no...
[00:17:58.500 --> 00:17:59.500]   Okay, Obama.
[00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:00.500]   Yeah.
[00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:02.500]   And now this is an accelerated mother thing.
[00:18:02.500 --> 00:18:03.500]   There is.
[00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:04.500]   There is a demo, yeah.
[00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:07.500]   If there is a carousel, it's the carousel that is AMP-ready content.
[00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:10.500]   So click on one of those and the first time it loads, it's got to load the library.
[00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:12.500]   There's a little rendering error.
[00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:13.500]   Okay.
[00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:14.500]   Oops.
[00:18:14.500 --> 00:18:15.500]   So go back to the first one.
[00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:16.500]   Yeah.
[00:18:16.500 --> 00:18:17.500]   Load that.
[00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:18.500]   This is the Wall Street Journal.
[00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:19.500]   That didn't work.
[00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:20.500]   No.
[00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:21.500]   Bing.
[00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:23.500]   Yeah, that loads very fast.
[00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:25.500]   Now swipe a left.
[00:18:25.500 --> 00:18:28.500]   We don't know what that is, but swipe left.
[00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:29.500]   Swipe left.
[00:18:29.500 --> 00:18:30.500]   Oh.
[00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:31.500]   Swipe left.
[00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:34.500]   So you can see why news organizations might like this.
[00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:35.500]   Bing.
[00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:36.500]   Swipe left.
[00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:37.500]   Yeah.
[00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:38.500]   It is pre-loading the carousel.
[00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:39.500]   It is pre-loading.
[00:18:39.500 --> 00:18:41.500]   So it's a combination of things.
[00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:42.500]   Yes.
[00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:48.500]   It's prohibiting a lot of web stuff like forms and embeds.
[00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:54.500]   And in fact, the video and audio tag, you have to use Google's own tags for that.
[00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:55.500]   Right.
[00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:57.500]   So that's the other bit that's slightly sketchy about this.
[00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:00.500]   You have to replace video and audio tags with AMP.
[00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:01.500]   Tags.
[00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:02.500]   And image tags even.
[00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:03.500]   Yeah.
[00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:04.500]   Image tags too.
[00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:05.500]   Oh.
[00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:06.500]   Image, AMP video, AMP audio.
[00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:08.500]   And what is happening when I do that?
[00:19:08.500 --> 00:19:10.500]   What is going on with this video?
[00:19:10.500 --> 00:19:12.500]   Is that so that can cache it?
[00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:14.500]   Is that the purpose of that?
[00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:19.500]   It basically means that it's running JavaScript under Google's control to show that.
[00:19:19.500 --> 00:19:21.500]   So presumably that means that they can cache it.
[00:19:21.500 --> 00:19:23.500]   It's completely how that works yet.
[00:19:23.500 --> 00:19:25.500]   Because I'm no sister.
[00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:30.300]   And the paranoid among us might say it so they could put a pre-roll in there or if they can
[00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:33.500]   actually gather information about you.
[00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:37.500]   I think they were asked about data and said they're not gathering any more data now through
[00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:39.500]   this than they would otherwise.
[00:19:39.500 --> 00:19:42.500]   Which is a non-answer by the way.
[00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:45.500]   I think they should have a very clear policy about that and put that out there.
[00:19:45.500 --> 00:19:50.500]   Because you are giving, basically Google is now a third party that has access to everything.
[00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:52.500]   Well, well, not necessarily.
[00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:54.500]   Google already crawls your entire website.
[00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:55.500]   So there's not a big difference there.
[00:19:55.500 --> 00:19:56.500]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:58.500]   The difference is they're crawling me.
[00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:02.500]   I mean, I'm using, I am now, they're getting information about me.
[00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:03.500]   No Leo.
[00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:04.500]   No Leo.
[00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:06.500]   Google does not have to be the caching agent for this.
[00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:08.500]   You do not have to go through Google's cache.
[00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:09.500]   You're using Google's--
[00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:16.500]   Yes, but Jeff, if I use Google's script for the video tag, it's going through Google to whoever's
[00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:22.500]   cache it is.
[00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:24.500]   And at that point, they have access.
[00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:27.500]   They're a third party that has access to every bit of information about me.
[00:20:27.500 --> 00:20:28.500]   The browser knows.
[00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:29.500]   Right, Jeff?
[00:20:29.500 --> 00:20:30.500]   You're asking you to ask Kevin now.
[00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:31.500]   Right, right, Kevin?
[00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:32.500]   What's sneezing now?
[00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:33.500]   Google's video tag doesn't mean Google's serving the video.
[00:20:33.500 --> 00:20:35.500]   No, it means though it goes through Google.
[00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:36.500]   The JavaScript comes to the--
[00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:37.500]   What it means--
[00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:38.500]   It potentially does.
[00:20:38.500 --> 00:20:39.500]   It does with the images.
[00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:44.500]   No, but the images what they are doing is they're taking the image you give them and rendering other versions.
[00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:45.500]   And they said that.
[00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:46.500]   I'm not sure what they said that for the video.
[00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:48.500]   They definitely said it for the images.
[00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:51.500]   Well, they're doing the same thing with video and audio as well.
[00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:57.500]   So presumably, when I see video here and I play it, I'm invoking some Google specific
[00:20:57.500 --> 00:20:58.500]   JavaScript.
[00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:00.500]   I don't know if it's open code or not.
[00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:05.500]   Some Google specific JavaScript that then loads the video and maybe they're doing some caching
[00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:06.500]   or whatever.
[00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:09.500]   Maybe they said that it could all come from your server directly.
[00:21:09.500 --> 00:21:10.500]   Not a JavaScript.
[00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:15.500]   Not a JavaScript.
[00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:17.500]   They're taking JavaScript away from you.
[00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:24.500]   So the script that's used to run any audio, video, or images is loaded from Google's servers.
[00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:25.500]   Is that correct?
[00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:26.500]   Yes.
[00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:29.500]   Well, wait, Kevin, let's be clear here.
[00:21:29.500 --> 00:21:30.500]   Video isn't loaded.
[00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:32.500]   The script is part of the one--
[00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:33.500]   It doesn't matter.
[00:21:33.500 --> 00:21:39.500]   It doesn't matter, Jeff, because as soon as I load anything from Google's servers, they're now a third party
[00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:41.500]   involved in this transaction.
[00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:44.500]   Well, that has access to everything in my browser.
[00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:46.500]   Okay, but I'm just asking.
[00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:53.500]   There's a library of scripts once loaded from any source.
[00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:56.500]   Doesn't have to be Google, from any source.
[00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:58.500]   They're Google approved.
[00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:03.500]   That doesn't mean that every time you use any one of those scripts or it calls back to Google, does it?
[00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:10.500]   Well, yeah, because it's kind of-- it says you're not clear, because it's all of it's running locally.
[00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:11.500]   So I don't have to work that out.
[00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:12.500]   So that's what I'm saying.
[00:22:12.500 --> 00:22:13.500]   I think I think most of them--
[00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:15.500]   First time we've loaded once and then run it locally from them.
[00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:16.500]   Exactly.
[00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:18.500]   That's how it speeds up.
[00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:19.500]   Exactly.
[00:22:19.500 --> 00:22:20.500]   That's the whole point.
[00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:24.500]   And wait, listen, it's less limited than in certain articles.
[00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:30.500]   Because in certain articles, you are serving directly from Facebook's servers, and you're using Facebook's structure,
[00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:32.500]   and Facebook gets all the data.
[00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:34.500]   So it's less limited than that.
[00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:36.500]   I don't know the details enough to know the answer.
[00:22:36.500 --> 00:22:38.500]   These are very good and important questions.
[00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:39.500]   There was a moment after--
[00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:43.500]   And I should make it clear, I don't really care, but this is what people are going to say immediately.
[00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:49.500]   Because what I first thought about this is, well, this is Google's just making sure that they get all the data they want.
[00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:51.500]   They were asked, but I don't think so.
[00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:55.500]   I think they'd go in such hot water if they did, especially after the things we'll talk about in Europe in a few minutes.
[00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:57.500]   But there's no way you can tell.
[00:22:57.500 --> 00:22:59.500]   The problem is, the problem is, this was done--
[00:22:59.500 --> 00:23:05.500]   There was a conversation afterwards with the brilliant technology head of one media company,
[00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:12.500]   who came over to Bez and said, you know, they dumbed down the presentation to what they think is a media reporter's level.
[00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:16.500]   But you have people like Danny Sullivan sitting there saying, "Whoa, what's-- what's-- what's-- what?
[00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:18.500]   Because they're speaking in kitty language."
[00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:23.500]   Well, if somebody cares, they can go to the GitHub repository and look at exactly what's happening.
[00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:26.500]   Right, we were asking questions right there, but they were talking down.
[00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:29.500]   And that's not what, you know, what Dave Bezberg's normally does.
[00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:32.500]   They should have talked up, they should have answered these questions in full,
[00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:37.500]   so we wouldn't have the kind of questions we have right now and don't have to dig into the GitHub to get these answers.
[00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:41.500]   But my understanding is, again, I'm not technical, I don't know well enough.
[00:23:41.500 --> 00:23:44.500]   It's a library that is shared.
[00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:46.500]   That's the essence of this.
[00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:50.500]   Now, just because it's a library that Google has approved, I do not know.
[00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:55.500]   I do not know the answer to this, but I do not know whether there's any reason for any of that to ping back to Google.
[00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:59.500]   Here's the bit I was talking about, Kevin Marks.
[00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:06.500]   You can add a tag, "development=1" to the URL, and then it will check your AMP HTML.
[00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:09.500]   Right, I tried that, but it didn't seem to do anything, so I'm sure.
[00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:10.500]   Oh, okay.
[00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:14.500]   And as you mentioned, initially I didn't mention SVG, but they have later included that.
[00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:16.500]   That is among the allowed.
[00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:17.500]   Yes.
[00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:18.500]   Thank you.
[00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:19.500]   Yeah, that was my first question.
[00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:21.500]   I was reading through this this morning, sorry, got up, because they did this thing some--
[00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:24.500]   got up for our early in the morning in New York, they're learning.
[00:24:24.500 --> 00:24:25.500]   Yes.
[00:24:25.500 --> 00:24:26.500]   West Coast time.
[00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:29.500]   So I was like kind of groggying before my coffee.
[00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:31.500]   We didn't go, " SVG is on the band list."
[00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:32.500]   And I'm like, "What?
[00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:35.500]   How can you, you know, and swab Google on, on, and Twitter?"
[00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:38.500]   Until they credit their responding very quickly saying, "Oh, we forgot to update.
[00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:39.500]   No, we do allow."
[00:24:39.500 --> 00:24:41.500]   We didn't put that in.
[00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:43.500]   SVG, so.
[00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:48.500]   So I understand the idea of, "Okay, here's best practices.
[00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:51.500]   Don't use this, this, and this."
[00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:56.660]   I think they go, "I understand why they ban JavaScript, but if you've ever tried to use
[00:24:56.660 --> 00:25:01.100]   the web with no script on and block JavaScript, you see that it breaks everything."
[00:25:01.100 --> 00:25:02.100]   So--
[00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:04.700]   Well, I mean, if there were some things based on this, and this was the point, the JSTL thing
[00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:08.500]   that Tensek was talking about is that the web should work without JavaScript.
[00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:09.500]   Yes.
[00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:12.500]   If you're doing it right, you should have declarative stuff in HTML.
[00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:13.500]   No, there's a no script to say.
[00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:17.500]   And JavaScript enhancing it to make it more interactive.
[00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:19.500]   And one of the sort of-- one of the anti-paths.
[00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:20.500]   It should grade gracefully.
[00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:25.500]   Well, no, it should be-- it should enhance itself.
[00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:27.500]   It should be progressive enhancement.
[00:25:27.500 --> 00:25:28.500]   Okay.
[00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:31.500]   The grade gracefully is framing it backwards.
[00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:34.500]   You should start with coming to the works as pure HTML.
[00:25:34.500 --> 00:25:36.500]   You should add beauty to it with CSS.
[00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:39.500]   Except nobody does that.
[00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:45.500]   Well, no, people-- this is-- yeah, there's a separate movement that does the work that's
[00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:46.500]   done in this project.
[00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:48.500]   There's a strand here, right?
[00:25:48.500 --> 00:25:49.500]   Yes, yeah.
[00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:54.300]   The HTML is actually a lot better than it was 10 years ago because of the Web Standards
[00:25:54.300 --> 00:25:59.100]   project and what WG and the groups that have brought through HTML5 and the better markup
[00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:00.100]   that is in there.
[00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:02.500]   So you can do a lot of good stuff with declarative HTML these days.
[00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:08.500]   CSS has also got better, which means that you can do good, subtle layout stuff.
[00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:13.900]   And the voodoo you had to do is gradually being reduced as we get into continuous updating
[00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:16.500]   browsers and the things we're all through.
[00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:23.700]   However-- and so there is this anti-pattern which is all the new sites have sold their
[00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:28.500]   souls to ad tech and sold our browsers to ad tech, which means that for every news page
[00:26:28.500 --> 00:26:31.500]   we read it downloads 10 times as much other stuff and uses up.
[00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:34.500]   Isn't that kind of what this is a response to?
[00:26:34.500 --> 00:26:36.500]   So this is a response to that.
[00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:42.500]   It's also a response to-- and it's also a response to the-- we can do this faster in a non-web
[00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:49.500]   way and then there was a whole raft of articles that by far hard, mind you at New York Times
[00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:52.500]   and so on the version, but you were saying the mobile web is terrible.
[00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:54.500]   Look at how bad our site is.
[00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:55.500]   It's like, yes, look at how bad your site is.
[00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:56.500]   The mobile web is just fine.
[00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:58.500]   You can just stop your site being crap.
[00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:03.500]   And this is Google taking that on board but also saying, OK, we're Google, here's some
[00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:07.500]   tooling, here's a way to stop your site being crap, here's some stuff that works.
[00:27:07.500 --> 00:27:10.500]   And overall, that is a good thing.
[00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:17.500]   There is another anti-pattern that's going on, which is the so-called single page web app
[00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:24.500]   world view, where the idea is instead of actually rendering HTML pages and then adding CSS and
[00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:30.500]   JavaScript to enhance them, you just send JavaScript down to the browser, run the JavaScript
[00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:33.500]   and generate the HTML and CSS and everything from that.
[00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:38.500]   This is a development style that's grown up over the last few years.
[00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:43.500]   And I think Twitter switched it for a while and then backed away and horror and went back
[00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:45.500]   to doing it in a more sensible way.
[00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:50.500]   But there's still this pattern that-- and there are things that this does make sense for.
[00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:56.500]   The classic example being Gmail, where that is actually an application that you're running.
[00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:58.500]   It's not a series of pages.
[00:27:58.500 --> 00:27:59.500]   It's loading stuff.
[00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:00.500]   Yeah, try using Gmail.
[00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:02.500]   I believe Gmail has missed an app.
[00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:03.500]   Oh, yeah, yeah.
[00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:07.500]   They're not saying that everything on the web should do this.
[00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:09.500]   Gmail can't be publicly cached.
[00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:10.500]   He's an app.
[00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:11.500]   Yeah.
[00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:12.500]   Right.
[00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:13.500]   They're fully aware of that.
[00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:18.500]   So basically what they're saying is that for the things that should really be static pages,
[00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:20.500]   here's a path for doing static pages.
[00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:21.500]   Exactly.
[00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:27.500]   And if you do it this way, we will guide you through the path so that you can still inject
[00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:30.500]   certain approved ad networks and tracking things.
[00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:35.500]   But we as Google will vet them for you so they're not like evil things that take over everyone's
[00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:36.500]   browsers.
[00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:39.500]   And that is something that Google has--
[00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:40.500]   You don't have to use it.
[00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:41.500]   You don't have to use it.
[00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:42.500]   But there's two issues here.
[00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:43.500]   Yeah.
[00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:46.500]   One is they were asked-- Jinger's was asked, point blank.
[00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:51.500]   Are you going to advantage AMP content particularly?
[00:28:51.500 --> 00:28:52.500]   Right.
[00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:53.500]   For the search results.
[00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:56.500]   The search results and in the carousels and such.
[00:28:56.500 --> 00:29:00.500]   And well, the carousels right now, it is just AMP content.
[00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:01.500]   But that's-- I don't know whether that goes.
[00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:05.500]   But what he said was, no, we will not advantage AMP content.
[00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:09.500]   And whatever, as you all know, we do advantage faster content.
[00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:12.500]   And this is a way to make all your stuff faster.
[00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:16.500]   So that's one issue like this is that are you motivated to go to it.
[00:29:16.500 --> 00:29:20.500]   The second one is you're still going to have non-AMP pages, whether-- because they shouldn't
[00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:22.500]   be AMP at all or because you just have them because you have them.
[00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:28.500]   And one thing that they have not done yet is to get it so that when Twitter sees a link
[00:29:28.500 --> 00:29:33.500]   or I put a link in my blog that's a non-AMP link, when the AMP version exists, they want
[00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:36.500]   the means to check and say, does an AMP version exist?
[00:29:36.500 --> 00:29:40.500]   And if so, I will serve the AMP version to make it faster than the non-AMP version, which
[00:29:40.500 --> 00:29:44.500]   you will still have AMP and non-AMP versions of tons of content.
[00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:47.500]   You will have some content that will not be appropriate for AMP.
[00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:52.500]   But as Kevin just said, there's tons and tons and tons of basically old newspaper pages
[00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:59.500]   that are static content that are horribly wasteful in the experience and cost you time
[00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:06.500]   and cost you data and cost you all kinds of things, this should reduce that.
[00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:08.500]   That's the way I see it.
[00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:12.500]   And to me, there are then further implications about how you can build different experiences.
[00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:17.500]   Because once a link is fast, that fundamentally changes the idea of forcing people to go to
[00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:21.500]   the link that says, let the content come to the person rather than making the person
[00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:22.500]   go to the content.
[00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:23.500]   But yes, these are issues.
[00:30:23.500 --> 00:30:29.500]   So soon as -- so, okay, so if you're creating a blog or web page, should you use this technology,
[00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:33.500]   and how would you use this technology?
[00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:41.500]   If you're using WordPress, for example, they were there today, it will -- I don't know
[00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:45.500]   about old templates and how that works, but WordPress will make it so that your stuff
[00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:47.500]   becomes AMP-ready.
[00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:49.500]   And you'll be using it.
[00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:53.500]   And then the next question is, when you link to something, you're going to want to link
[00:30:53.500 --> 00:30:57.500]   to the AMP version because you're going to want your reader to have a better experience,
[00:30:57.500 --> 00:30:58.500]   it goes the argument, right?
[00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:00.500]   And they'll say the thing immediately, and they won't be likely to say, oh, well, I was
[00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:02.500]   up that other session five minutes in Twitter.
[00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:03.500]   Right?
[00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:06.500]   And so, no, I'm still here, and I saw that page, and that was great.
[00:31:06.500 --> 00:31:07.500]   So quickly, I read it.
[00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:08.500]   Thank you very much.
[00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:09.500]   Well, next, next, next, next, next.
[00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:15.500]   And I think that that changes the idea of how you start to develop what you develop.
[00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:16.500]   And it changes your mind.
[00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:20.500]   And I want to see it happen, too, as I want to see not just full pages done this way,
[00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:27.500]   I want to see a world where there are AMP-ready modules that can be loaded into things, like
[00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:31.500]   embeddable tweets, like cards, like Vox's card carousels.
[00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:33.500]   You can just iframe it this way.
[00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:35.500]   Yeah, basically you're doing that.
[00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:39.500]   I mean, that's kind of what they're doing in the web browser there, right?
[00:31:39.500 --> 00:31:43.500]   It's a little hard to see exactly how that's working because it's on the mobile thing and
[00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:46.500]   it's not a bad part yet.
[00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:51.500]   But the thing they're doing, the search demo showing you the pages and you slide through
[00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:54.500]   them is basically there's two things going on.
[00:31:54.500 --> 00:31:59.500]   One is they're requiring you to put in a bunch of markup in the front that generates the
[00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:01.500]   previews that show up there.
[00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:04.500]   And they're being a bit restrictive about what markup they'll take for that, but we can
[00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:08.500]   have that argument with them later on in order to open that kind of words up now.
[00:32:08.500 --> 00:32:11.500]   So they're saying you need to put in this is a news article.
[00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:12.500]   It has a title.
[00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:14.500]   It has an image and this has your logo.
[00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:18.500]   And then they show that as in the result previews at the top.
[00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:23.500]   And then I think they have to bless you to say, yes, you're actually a partner in this or
[00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:29.500]   you're worthy of being shown in this carousel, which is another hegemonic thing, to some extent.
[00:32:29.500 --> 00:32:32.500]   And then they are then using preload.
[00:32:32.500 --> 00:32:37.500]   So when they load those little thumbnails, they are then preloading the pages.
[00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:40.500]   I think into my frames, it's not quite clear.
[00:32:40.500 --> 00:32:45.500]   And then as you scrub left and right, you're getting those preloaded pages showing up quickly.
[00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:50.500]   And the advantage of that is that, you know, the advantage of them making them small is
[00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:53.500]   that those iframes don't end up like making your browser fall over and die, which is
[00:32:53.500 --> 00:32:56.500]   going to be a problem when you generate lots of little separate pages.
[00:32:56.500 --> 00:32:59.500]   Now that was my sense of what's going on there, but there's probably some more subtle stuff
[00:32:59.500 --> 00:33:01.500]   going on behind the scenes there.
[00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:02.500]   Is this just for text?
[00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:04.500]   Does that affect that?
[00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:05.500]   That demonstrates in that.
[00:33:05.500 --> 00:33:07.500]   Is this just for text heavy content?
[00:33:07.500 --> 00:33:12.500]   Amplify my pages on Twitter?
[00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:14.500]   Not so much the homepage, Leo, but yes.
[00:33:14.500 --> 00:33:19.500]   I want to link directly to a page that has this episode in there.
[00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:23.500]   Yeah, you want it to come up quickly on mobile and people will be able to start watching the
[00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:24.500]   video immediately.
[00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:25.500]   Right.
[00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:30.500]   Now, what all that entails when you have so much video, I do not know.
[00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:32.500]   Yeah, I can't.
[00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:36.500]   I mean, it's not going to happen because we're, it's a no JS.
[00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:41.500]   A website, coding it into AMP would be a bit of a challenge.
[00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:44.500]   Well, more than just putting a header in there, right?
[00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:46.500]   Well, no, it's basically changing your template.
[00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:49.500]   So you basically, you've got a template system that you generate your page with.
[00:33:49.500 --> 00:33:50.500]   Yeah.
[00:33:50.500 --> 00:33:52.500]   So you have another template that's the AMP version of each page.
[00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:53.500]   Right.
[00:33:53.500 --> 00:33:54.500]   Right, exactly.
[00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:55.500]   Okay.
[00:33:55.500 --> 00:33:57.500]   And you're using the library.
[00:33:57.500 --> 00:34:01.500]   You're basically using a Java, as I understand it, Kevin, tell me if I'm wrong here, because
[00:34:01.500 --> 00:34:02.500]   I often am.
[00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:05.500]   You're basically using a JavaScript library, a different JavaScript library that's been
[00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:10.500]   pre-approved and pre-fetched onto users' devices.
[00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:11.500]   Yeah.
[00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:13.500]   That's, that's the theory.
[00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:14.500]   Yeah.
[00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:16.500]   You know, it's a fairly big JavaScript library, I think.
[00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:20.500]   I haven't actually pre-filed this stuff yet, but it seems to have a bit of heft to it.
[00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:27.500]   But, and it's, and it's implementing the custom element stuff drop-ins, which means that
[00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:33.500]   that's only native on Chrome and is, has to use patches on other browsers.
[00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:35.500]   So there'll be more JavaScript running in non-chrome.
[00:34:35.500 --> 00:34:38.500]   So there's like to be more responsive on Chrome than it is on other browsers, I suspect.
[00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:41.500]   Is this Web 3.0, Kevin?
[00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:43.500]   No, that's just a nonsense name.
[00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:45.500]   Thank you, Kevin.
[00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:52.500]   I mean, basically this is, this is using some existing Web technologies to try and, you
[00:34:52.500 --> 00:34:55.500]   generate better Web pages.
[00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:58.500]   But it is also fire-walling off certain Web technologies.
[00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:04.820]   You know, when you take away the image tag and the video tag and the audio tag, you, and
[00:35:04.820 --> 00:35:08.700]   replace them with a proprietary version, you're losing a lot of the flexibility of them.
[00:35:08.700 --> 00:35:10.900]   And that's, that's, and that's, that's, that's the definition of it.
[00:35:10.900 --> 00:35:11.900]   Well, that is also true.
[00:35:11.900 --> 00:35:14.940]   The question is, how is this standard going to be maintained?
[00:35:14.940 --> 00:35:20.660]   Will Google be open sufficiently to new things that occur and, and new needs around new content
[00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:22.380]   presentation types?
[00:35:22.380 --> 00:35:27.540]   And will there be, you know, a benefit, a beneficent dictator on this standard?
[00:35:27.540 --> 00:35:31.420]   I asked Bess, is this something that should be added to, because I'm trying to get my
[00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:34.180]   head around still, should be added to the next HTML standard.
[00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:35.540]   He said, no, it's just HTML.
[00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:37.340]   It's just the Web.
[00:35:37.340 --> 00:35:38.340]   It's a subset.
[00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:45.540]   It's, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's
[00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:47.540]   just an execution of it.
[00:35:47.540 --> 00:35:48.540]   Yeah.
[00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:51.380]   I'm trying to let this on my iPhone.
[00:35:51.380 --> 00:35:52.380]   Oh my.
[00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:55.580]   iPod and realizing that this thing is too small.
[00:35:55.580 --> 00:35:59.940]   I feel like this is a complete non-starter, but okay.
[00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:00.940]   Really?
[00:36:00.940 --> 00:36:01.940]   Okay.
[00:36:01.940 --> 00:36:02.940]   What?
[00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:08.180]   Well, it'll be fine for big news organizations and Vox and people like that who have full-time
[00:36:08.180 --> 00:36:13.260]   engineers on staff who have apparently enough cycles to create a completely separate template
[00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:19.580]   for their content that is, you know, a Google standard.
[00:36:19.580 --> 00:36:20.740]   And they'll be a benefit.
[00:36:20.740 --> 00:36:25.020]   I presume to them because stuff will load a little bit faster.
[00:36:25.020 --> 00:36:28.700]   It's like the things you're giving up are not insignificant.
[00:36:28.700 --> 00:36:29.700]   Well, okay.
[00:36:29.700 --> 00:36:33.260]   I mean, I understand you from your perspective and you just, I'm not doing it.
[00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:36.140]   I wouldn't do this in a million years.
[00:36:36.140 --> 00:36:41.980]   Well, I, I, I, I don't have the resources to suddenly adopt a new standard.
[00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:45.580]   Well, Kevin, what would it take to just, you know, all you're doing is having the no.js
[00:36:45.580 --> 00:36:50.780]   generate a page in a different template that is, that's not trivial coding.
[00:36:50.780 --> 00:36:52.660]   Well, because it's not trivial.
[00:36:52.660 --> 00:36:54.820]   I'd have to have an engineer do it.
[00:36:54.820 --> 00:36:55.820]   It's not, it's not.
[00:36:55.820 --> 00:36:56.820]   That's not an engineer do it.
[00:36:56.820 --> 00:36:57.820]   Yeah.
[00:36:57.820 --> 00:36:58.820]   It's not.
[00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:03.820]   It's a, it's how many days of design and coding and testing is it?
[00:37:03.820 --> 00:37:07.180]   Um, I'll let you do what I've done it.
[00:37:07.180 --> 00:37:08.180]   Yeah.
[00:37:08.180 --> 00:37:10.220]   So, I mean, so far I've got something up.
[00:37:10.220 --> 00:37:14.580]   It's easy to do what you're doing, which is to go from scratch, from a new page and
[00:37:14.580 --> 00:37:15.580]   do this.
[00:37:15.580 --> 00:37:16.580]   I could do that.
[00:37:16.580 --> 00:37:17.580]   That's trivial.
[00:37:17.580 --> 00:37:20.740]   To take an existing site and amplify it.
[00:37:20.740 --> 00:37:26.820]   Yeah, the, the challenge is going to be, um, the challenge is going to be, you know, the,
[00:37:26.820 --> 00:37:29.740]   the basic page stuff to just go through, the challenge is going to be how you deal with
[00:37:29.740 --> 00:37:32.660]   image embedding and video embedding and things like that.
[00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:36.260]   And there will be an assumption that you'll have a module that will handle those for you.
[00:37:36.260 --> 00:37:40.940]   And so that's, you know, it's something that, you know, medium and buzzfeed and so on will,
[00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:44.700]   and, you know, WordPress clearly will have the tools to help you do that.
[00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:47.340]   But as a, as an individual, you'll have to work out how to do this.
[00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:52.700]   So it is extra work and if your site is a custom layout, you will basically have to
[00:37:52.700 --> 00:37:53.940]   have another parallel set of layouts.
[00:37:53.940 --> 00:37:57.900]   So it has the side file problem that you have to generate another version of your site.
[00:37:57.900 --> 00:38:00.420]   And then you have to test twice as many pages.
[00:38:00.420 --> 00:38:03.820]   So yeah, there is, there is another words not going to happen.
[00:38:03.820 --> 00:38:08.060]   It's going to just like Facebook, uh, and, uh, you know, the, all these different initiatives.
[00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:10.820]   This is for an elite.
[00:38:10.820 --> 00:38:14.780]   And this is one of the things that kind of bugs me, an elite group of, uh, web publishers
[00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:17.300]   who, uh, um, well, it's, it's not.
[00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:20.940]   But both ends, it's also people who are elite who use things like WordPress and rely on
[00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:23.500]   them to do it for them and have the structure there.
[00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:25.780]   You're in a large middle ground in a sense.
[00:38:25.780 --> 00:38:27.100]   It's a good build your own.
[00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:28.300]   It's WordPress has to do it.
[00:38:28.300 --> 00:38:32.660]   If WordPress is willing to do the work, then I guess then I just get it.
[00:38:32.660 --> 00:38:36.180]   Three millions of sites on WordPress are able to get the benefit.
[00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:37.180]   Yes.
[00:38:37.180 --> 00:38:40.260]   You're in a position where you paid a fortune to build something just finished.
[00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:44.620]   What is, uh, what would be, would there be limitations on things I could do on my WordPress
[00:38:44.620 --> 00:38:45.620]   blog?
[00:38:45.620 --> 00:38:46.620]   If I amplify it.
[00:38:46.620 --> 00:38:48.780]   Is there other things I don't have to be cautious about doing.
[00:38:48.780 --> 00:38:52.820]   Well, so for example, the, the, because it won't, um, let you load.
[00:38:52.820 --> 00:38:56.580]   So I, I said that in my, in my post, it won't let me load client side JavaScript, which means
[00:38:56.580 --> 00:39:01.540]   that my frag mentions code that lets you link to a, a word within the page doesn't run.
[00:39:01.540 --> 00:39:06.300]   And it also means that my web mentions code that runs client side to fetch the people tweeting
[00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:07.860]   about my post doesn't run.
[00:39:07.860 --> 00:39:11.500]   So it is, it is, it is cutting down the functionality of my side.
[00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:13.860]   And those are progressive enhancements that I have on my website.
[00:39:13.860 --> 00:39:17.140]   My website is mostly static, but it has these little JavaScript things that enhance it and
[00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:18.540]   make it more interactive.
[00:39:18.540 --> 00:39:22.420]   So they, they are, they are cutting that out and I'd, in order to get this to work, I would
[00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:25.500]   have to go through the process of getting those scripts approved by Google and being
[00:39:25.500 --> 00:39:27.140]   put into their system.
[00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:33.100]   Um, and that's, you know, that, that is, that is the overhead part.
[00:39:33.100 --> 00:39:35.860]   So, and Google's an all gatekeeper in some respects.
[00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:38.740]   In effect, Google is becoming a gatekeeper, which scripts can run.
[00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:43.660]   And so they've already blessed Twitters in beds and vine in beds and YouTube in beds.
[00:39:43.660 --> 00:39:46.340]   It just strikes me as those usual suspects here.
[00:39:46.340 --> 00:39:52.980]   I feel like, I feel like we've moved into, we're moving into this era where there's an
[00:39:52.980 --> 00:39:55.380]   elite set of publishers, the usual suspects.
[00:39:55.380 --> 00:39:58.980]   So you're at the point and the rest of us are just going to go, what?
[00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:07.420]   I just, well, the thing is, you know, we have, we've, we've been sort of edged our way
[00:40:07.420 --> 00:40:07.780]   towards this.
[00:40:07.780 --> 00:40:11.740]   So we now have three competing markup formats and three competing browsers.
[00:40:11.740 --> 00:40:12.220]   Nice.
[00:40:12.500 --> 00:40:13.980]   That's always worked well, hasn't it?
[00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:14.300]   Yeah.
[00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:16.100]   Well, that's the discouraging part of this.
[00:40:16.100 --> 00:40:20.700]   Now, they're not, you know, they're not completely terrible and opaque, but they are
[00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:20.980]   different.
[00:40:20.980 --> 00:40:26.660]   But now we said, what we know now, now, now know is that Facebook's is basically HTML,
[00:40:26.660 --> 00:40:31.220]   except that they've got some rules about which markup you should use and they're quite
[00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:32.020]   complicated rules.
[00:40:32.020 --> 00:40:36.020]   Um, you know, there are specific things you have to do to embed maps and images and
[00:40:36.020 --> 00:40:37.940]   things and they've certain class names that require.
[00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:44.780]   Um, Google's is broader HTML, except that they banned some of the most common tab is
[00:40:44.780 --> 00:40:48.260]   possible, including image and say use our special magic image tags that aren't quite
[00:40:48.260 --> 00:40:51.060]   image tags that have different layout structures and have different.
[00:40:51.060 --> 00:40:59.260]   Um, CSS and goes through Java script that is, but created and goes through Google.
[00:40:59.260 --> 00:41:03.700]   Well, yeah, but, you know, the Facebook goes to Facebook, the government goes to Apple.
[00:41:03.700 --> 00:41:07.500]   So I'm not, I'm not saying it's better or worse than Facebook or apples.
[00:41:07.900 --> 00:41:09.940]   I think they have the same, they all have the same problem.
[00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:10.780]   They're not the same problem.
[00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:11.100]   Exactly.
[00:41:11.100 --> 00:41:14.940]   So the, but then the Apple one, there's Apple news format, which they have not even
[00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:15.740]   published yet.
[00:41:15.740 --> 00:41:17.940]   Um, so we don't know what that's going to look like.
[00:41:17.940 --> 00:41:22.220]   It might be like the weird XML nonsense they came up with Apple TV.
[00:41:22.220 --> 00:41:23.980]   It may not even be an HTML variant at all.
[00:41:23.980 --> 00:41:24.820]   We don't know.
[00:41:24.820 --> 00:41:31.340]   Currently what they're taking is RSS two feeds with HTML in, um, and certain constraints
[00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:33.180]   on what you have to put in your RSS feeds.
[00:41:33.180 --> 00:41:37.340]   So there's some, you know, there's some ability to map stuff back and forth.
[00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:40.580]   So yeah, the challenge is as a publisher, you may now have to generate four
[00:41:40.580 --> 00:41:41.420]   versions of your stuff.
[00:41:41.420 --> 00:41:47.860]   Um, you know, and instead of instead of one or, or, you know, they would probably
[00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:51.500]   were kind of generating to they were generating a, um, a desktop version of
[00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:53.540]   a well version and gradually emerged into one.
[00:41:53.540 --> 00:41:57.980]   And now you've got to generate a Google friendly one, a Facebook friendly one,
[00:41:57.980 --> 00:41:59.580]   an Apple friendly one as well as your Facebook.
[00:41:59.580 --> 00:42:00.020]   Well, no, no, no.
[00:42:00.020 --> 00:42:00.100]   Okay.
[00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:00.940]   That's the other question.
[00:42:00.940 --> 00:42:02.700]   I asked Corey.
[00:42:03.700 --> 00:42:10.100]   Who's at Washington Post and I said, I'll ask the panel who spoke and I said, you
[00:42:10.100 --> 00:42:11.940]   know, what about Facebook's instant articles?
[00:42:11.940 --> 00:42:14.780]   Is there any reason they can't come together as a standard here?
[00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:17.820]   So there's when you publish something in the sandpretty, it's also instant
[00:42:17.820 --> 00:42:18.260]   articles running.
[00:42:18.260 --> 00:42:20.380]   And she said, no, there's no reason that we couldn't come together.
[00:42:20.380 --> 00:42:22.020]   You couldn't end up with a standard.
[00:42:22.020 --> 00:42:25.700]   What basically the other thing that's happened here is that left, left open to the
[00:42:25.700 --> 00:42:29.540]   desires of, of crappy publishers, we junked up the web terribly.
[00:42:29.540 --> 00:42:32.500]   Oh, that's made that's being handled now.
[00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:34.700]   Well, no, it's a bit, but that's the thing yet.
[00:42:34.700 --> 00:42:38.980]   So this is, yes, the publishers have screwed up and mostly because they will say,
[00:42:38.980 --> 00:42:41.460]   yes, to any snake old salesman who promises them more ads.
[00:42:41.460 --> 00:42:42.980]   And so they end up with a lot of craft in them.
[00:42:42.980 --> 00:42:47.100]   And and so we've got three companies who are technically competent trying to
[00:42:47.100 --> 00:42:49.020]   patch this, but they're doing it in their own weird ways.
[00:42:49.020 --> 00:42:50.100]   And so it is.
[00:42:50.100 --> 00:42:51.900]   And they're not doing it together.
[00:42:51.900 --> 00:42:53.780]   Well, Apple, I've brought to the side.
[00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:57.420]   Apple is just doing its own closed world.
[00:42:57.420 --> 00:43:00.140]   It's fenced world around news and trying to do what Apple does there.
[00:43:00.140 --> 00:43:01.460]   I would say that.
[00:43:02.020 --> 00:43:07.020]   Why isn't the reaction of, why isn't the reaction of content creators
[00:43:07.020 --> 00:43:08.660]   could just going to be, oh, screw it.
[00:43:08.660 --> 00:43:09.460]   I'm going to make an app.
[00:43:09.460 --> 00:43:13.820]   Well, because they've already tried that because nobody's going to download apps.
[00:43:13.820 --> 00:43:17.700]   And the effort it takes to get people to download an app and remember to use it
[00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:22.140]   and use it, the percentage of app usage versus download is tiny.
[00:43:22.140 --> 00:43:23.380]   And I don't let it cross the websites.
[00:43:23.380 --> 00:43:26.060]   If you're really, really devoted to it app, I know for every news,
[00:43:26.060 --> 00:43:31.220]   paper publisher, I know those who do use the apps are platinum users.
[00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:31.980]   They're wonderful.
[00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:35.020]   They're loyal, but the proportion is tiny, right?
[00:43:35.020 --> 00:43:36.300]   It's a tiny conversion.
[00:43:36.300 --> 00:43:40.740]   So these publishers feel like the benefit to them is that the page will load so much
[00:43:40.740 --> 00:43:46.540]   faster that what more people will link to them and more people will see their
[00:43:46.540 --> 00:43:50.540]   content really and basically the way I see it, Leo, the way I see it, I'm aware of that.
[00:43:50.540 --> 00:43:52.260]   Oh, the speed.
[00:43:52.260 --> 00:43:56.420]   Like when I put in a link, I'm going to say, gee, I'm going to put in a link
[00:43:56.420 --> 00:43:59.380]   because I don't want to use the speed of this link over that.
[00:43:59.380 --> 00:44:01.020]   Here's what I do.
[00:44:01.020 --> 00:44:05.900]   If I were like real clear politics or I know Jonathan at Nuzzle has been as
[00:44:05.900 --> 00:44:09.020]   excited about this and he's talked about it today.
[00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:12.100]   But let's just say I'm real clear politics, which is nothing but links, links, links, links.
[00:44:12.100 --> 00:44:16.500]   Or if I were drudge, right, or Huffington Post, let's just say RCP.
[00:44:16.500 --> 00:44:20.260]   I would I would do a new area that was nothing but AMP content.
[00:44:20.260 --> 00:44:23.900]   So the experience to my user is as if I'm as if I never leave the website, I just
[00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:26.340]   new page, new page, new page, how is that better than an app?
[00:44:27.820 --> 00:44:29.540]   I'll just tell me nobody's downloading apps.
[00:44:29.540 --> 00:44:31.900]   Now I have to have a new because it's on the open web.
[00:44:31.900 --> 00:44:32.620]   It's a link away.
[00:44:32.620 --> 00:44:34.180]   It's not a download and a report.
[00:44:34.180 --> 00:44:35.020]   I'm going to predict it.
[00:44:35.020 --> 00:44:38.340]   I'm going to predict that all three of these initiatives will be dead in the water
[00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:38.940]   within a year.
[00:44:38.940 --> 00:44:42.540]   I just don't I don't see it happening.
[00:44:42.540 --> 00:44:46.180]   I'm going to disagree.
[00:44:46.180 --> 00:44:47.700]   Let's talk in a year about AMP.
[00:44:47.700 --> 00:44:48.780]   Yeah, we will.
[00:44:48.780 --> 00:44:50.100]   OK, it could be waves.
[00:44:50.100 --> 00:44:51.380]   It could be waves.
[00:44:51.380 --> 00:44:52.860]   It's not even wave.
[00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:55.700]   It's a it's a it's a.
[00:44:55.700 --> 00:44:57.900]   It could be fast flip.
[00:44:57.900 --> 00:44:58.860]   It's a proposal.
[00:44:58.860 --> 00:45:04.060]   Yeah, it's fast flip or there's a million of them, but you have you do have a host of
[00:45:04.060 --> 00:45:06.260]   really major publishers up on a stage today.
[00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:10.100]   If you look at the list of all their so freaking desperate, they'll do anything
[00:45:10.100 --> 00:45:10.780]   at that point.
[00:45:10.780 --> 00:45:14.420]   They're the same publishers who said, yeah, what ad technology do you have that I can
[00:45:14.420 --> 00:45:14.740]   use?
[00:45:14.740 --> 00:45:15.260]   It's the same.
[00:45:15.260 --> 00:45:16.300]   You know what else I would do, Leo?
[00:45:16.300 --> 00:45:19.980]   I would if I started a media brand today, I would basically start at siteless.
[00:45:19.980 --> 00:45:21.780]   Yeah, I would agree.
[00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:25.620]   I disagree madly, but OK, well, as long as I'm going to be my state in the
[00:45:25.620 --> 00:45:26.500]   answer back.
[00:45:26.500 --> 00:45:31.140]   So what I'm saying here is is that if you recognize that fewer than 10% on major
[00:45:31.140 --> 00:45:34.780]   news sites apart from the New York Times, fewer than 10% of the audience in a day
[00:45:34.780 --> 00:45:37.700]   sees the homepage, they don't care about our packaging.
[00:45:37.700 --> 00:45:38.540]   They're not coming through.
[00:45:38.540 --> 00:45:39.020]   No, they don't.
[00:45:39.020 --> 00:45:39.940]   They like deep links.
[00:45:39.940 --> 00:45:40.140]   Yeah.
[00:45:40.140 --> 00:45:48.660]   And so if I could have my content, my value that I create on Facebook, on directly
[00:45:48.660 --> 00:45:53.220]   through Twitter, through other websites that people can experience me everywhere.
[00:45:53.540 --> 00:45:56.340]   And I don't have to have this marketing cost of constantly bringing people to me.
[00:45:56.340 --> 00:45:58.660]   This is basically BuzzFeed's business model, folks.
[00:45:58.660 --> 00:46:03.500]   This is in essence, BuzzFeed BuzzFeed says we can make our crap viral and
[00:46:03.500 --> 00:46:04.100]   divertizers.
[00:46:04.100 --> 00:46:05.940]   We can we can make your crap viral, too.
[00:46:05.940 --> 00:46:06.700]   We don't care.
[00:46:06.700 --> 00:46:10.020]   People come to our site really, because if they see us on Facebook or if they see
[00:46:10.020 --> 00:46:14.740]   us on Instagram or they see us everywhere, hallelujah, our mission is solved.
[00:46:14.740 --> 00:46:21.780]   So they're the first web property built post web or or uber web, you know, post
[00:46:21.780 --> 00:46:25.340]   site where, where, yeah, they come to BuzzFeed fine, but you, you, you can't run
[00:46:25.340 --> 00:46:25.700]   anywhere.
[00:46:25.700 --> 00:46:30.020]   And that's the lesson the publishers start to, should start to learn from BuzzFeed,
[00:46:30.020 --> 00:46:33.020]   not that you should do cats, not that you do listicles, but that you should
[00:46:33.020 --> 00:46:36.500]   recognize that you go to the readers where the readers are and build a business
[00:46:36.500 --> 00:46:39.780]   around that rather than still trying to operate in the old business model, which
[00:46:39.780 --> 00:46:42.660]   says number one, I've got a market like crazy to get people to come to me.
[00:46:42.660 --> 00:46:47.540]   And then number two, all I do is take the 30 seconds I have you at best and throw
[00:46:47.540 --> 00:46:51.500]   as many ads as in front of you as I can to sell them as volume as CPM until you
[00:46:51.500 --> 00:46:51.980]   go away.
[00:46:51.980 --> 00:46:52.340]   Right.
[00:46:52.340 --> 00:46:53.820]   I should encounter you wherever I can.
[00:46:53.820 --> 00:46:56.300]   Now, what's missing from that equation is we need more.
[00:46:56.300 --> 00:47:00.020]   We need still need to build a relationship with someone on knowledge, relevance,
[00:47:00.020 --> 00:47:00.500]   and value.
[00:47:00.500 --> 00:47:03.660]   So I need data back saying, Oh, that's Leo Leo likes this.
[00:47:03.660 --> 00:47:05.420]   I'll give Leo technology, right?
[00:47:05.420 --> 00:47:07.980]   Uh, but that's where I'm going to tell you.
[00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:10.020]   I'll see that role to Twitter and Facebook.
[00:47:10.020 --> 00:47:11.300]   You let them do that.
[00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:12.980]   I'm saying it's already happened.
[00:47:12.980 --> 00:47:15.340]   Leo horse barn horizon.
[00:47:15.340 --> 00:47:16.060]   No, I agree.
[00:47:16.060 --> 00:47:17.500]   No, I agree.
[00:47:17.500 --> 00:47:18.260]   Go on.
[00:47:18.260 --> 00:47:18.780]   So on.
[00:47:19.500 --> 00:47:21.540]   So I haven't held my FOS.
[00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:24.380]   I will agree with bits of that and I will group this group of bits of it.
[00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:27.220]   So the nobody goes to your homepage bit is true.
[00:47:27.220 --> 00:47:28.500]   I think I agree with that.
[00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:32.260]   I haven't been to the home page of the New York Times in 10 years that.
[00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:37.140]   Um, and that's also why, you know, Twitter's moments thing is weird because that's a,
[00:47:37.140 --> 00:47:40.340]   that's a very much front page of the New York Times kind of layout more.
[00:47:40.340 --> 00:47:42.100]   It's definitely a retrograde step.
[00:47:42.100 --> 00:47:48.660]   That feels, um, however, the value of saying people can get to my stuff in these
[00:47:48.660 --> 00:47:51.340]   other sites doesn't mean that you will pages should not exist.
[00:47:51.340 --> 00:47:55.740]   Um, as web pages, it just means that you, you, you make sure that they, they will
[00:47:55.740 --> 00:47:58.260]   actually show thomas other sites well and they'll bring you back.
[00:47:58.260 --> 00:48:02.740]   But, but, but, but it does clearly come into your, come into your site to see that
[00:48:02.740 --> 00:48:04.580]   webpage, that webpage is going to where you are.
[00:48:04.580 --> 00:48:08.660]   So yes, it doesn't kill the webpage, but the idea that you have to go to a site to
[00:48:08.660 --> 00:48:09.060]   get to it.
[00:48:09.060 --> 00:48:10.100]   Yeah.
[00:48:10.100 --> 00:48:13.540]   So, so, so then you were as far apart as, as you were applying.
[00:48:13.540 --> 00:48:16.380]   So, um, because, um, you were pageless.
[00:48:16.380 --> 00:48:18.180]   I said you were closer to sightless.
[00:48:18.900 --> 00:48:20.660]   Yes, but you have to put the page on the site.
[00:48:20.660 --> 00:48:22.140]   You know, they have to have your camera.
[00:48:22.140 --> 00:48:25.340]   It's an archive and a URL generator.
[00:48:25.340 --> 00:48:28.780]   Yeah, but it's not, but the art of your business.
[00:48:28.780 --> 00:48:29.140]   Fair.
[00:48:29.140 --> 00:48:31.260]   Um, can you have a.
[00:48:31.260 --> 00:48:34.660]   So we're going to mess up.
[00:48:34.660 --> 00:48:39.580]   So, well, what you said is something more like, um, reportedly, well, so what
[00:48:39.580 --> 00:48:41.900]   reportedly said was we don't have a website and they don't, you know, they
[00:48:41.900 --> 00:48:45.660]   have like barely anything there still, but they spend all their time tweeting stuff.
[00:48:46.100 --> 00:48:49.940]   Um, and that, that I can see what they're trying to do, but I'm less clear that
[00:48:49.940 --> 00:48:51.620]   that's, uh, you're right there, Kevin.
[00:48:51.620 --> 00:48:52.340]   You're absolutely right there.
[00:48:52.340 --> 00:48:54.300]   I, I, you know, listen, what do I do for a living?
[00:48:54.300 --> 00:48:54.980]   I go too far.
[00:48:54.980 --> 00:49:00.140]   Um, and so what I'm trying to do is to blow open the brains of media people who
[00:49:00.140 --> 00:49:02.900]   thinks that we still make a product that looks like a newspaper or magazine and
[00:49:02.900 --> 00:49:05.340]   it's called a website and has pages and I'm comfortable with that.
[00:49:05.340 --> 00:49:10.540]   And I'm saying, okay, you might still have pages, but you've, you've gone up in a drone
[00:49:10.540 --> 00:49:14.860]   and you spread them, uh, flow, floated all over the world and people get pick them
[00:49:14.860 --> 00:49:16.300]   up and go to them wherever they are.
[00:49:16.300 --> 00:49:17.900]   And you've got to make a business out of that.
[00:49:17.900 --> 00:49:19.900]   Right.
[00:49:19.900 --> 00:49:22.900]   So you're saying don't make a destination anymore.
[00:49:22.900 --> 00:49:24.180]   Cause it's not anymore.
[00:49:24.180 --> 00:49:27.980]   It's already not the destination now is owned by Facebook.
[00:49:27.980 --> 00:49:29.780]   Destination is a bad metaphor there, right?
[00:49:29.780 --> 00:49:34.780]   It's, it's the, because you may, it's where your users are, but, but you don't go.
[00:49:34.780 --> 00:49:36.340]   You don't, you don't start there.
[00:49:36.340 --> 00:49:37.340]   It's actually a starting point.
[00:49:37.340 --> 00:49:40.580]   It's no, the website for new sites is no longer the starting point.
[00:49:40.580 --> 00:49:42.860]   The starting point is Facebook and Twitter at all.
[00:49:43.340 --> 00:49:44.860]   So it's foolish to consider.
[00:49:44.860 --> 00:49:45.660]   It will appear there.
[00:49:45.660 --> 00:49:49.740]   So it's foolish to consider web technologies for making content, frankly.
[00:49:49.740 --> 00:49:53.420]   You should, you should make content native to whatever.
[00:49:53.420 --> 00:49:56.540]   Well, I mean, it can be a web technology as Facebook.
[00:49:56.540 --> 00:49:56.900]   Or articles.
[00:49:56.900 --> 00:49:57.580]   Right.
[00:49:57.580 --> 00:49:58.940]   If it's Facebook and storeacles, you're right.
[00:49:58.940 --> 00:50:00.060]   You're not making a web.
[00:50:00.060 --> 00:50:01.340]   You should make it native to whatever.
[00:50:01.340 --> 00:50:01.700]   Wherever.
[00:50:01.700 --> 00:50:07.500]   So, so your job as a content, your job as a content creator, it's not your web page.
[00:50:07.500 --> 00:50:11.460]   Your job as a content creator is to figure out where your audience is
[00:50:12.060 --> 00:50:16.300]   and go there and use whatever native tools are available to you in that place.
[00:50:16.300 --> 00:50:19.860]   Until such time as your audience moves on and then you chase.
[00:50:19.860 --> 00:50:22.740]   And have a relationship with them.
[00:50:22.740 --> 00:50:26.420]   And at that time, it's a good idea to have your, have your web pages so that
[00:50:26.420 --> 00:50:30.060]   so that they're not just lost in the silent, but just dying.
[00:50:30.060 --> 00:50:31.220]   That's not the, this makes sense.
[00:50:31.220 --> 00:50:35.740]   If you're a newspaper or magazine, I mean, clearly that, that seems that model is, is
[00:50:35.740 --> 00:50:36.580]   disintegrating.
[00:50:36.580 --> 00:50:38.700]   What about broadcast media?
[00:50:38.700 --> 00:50:43.420]   What is, because today you still have to go to Channel 9 to watch stuff on Channel
[00:50:43.420 --> 00:50:45.620]   9, although I imagine that's going to start changing.
[00:50:45.620 --> 00:50:46.220]   Sure.
[00:50:46.220 --> 00:50:50.140]   No, you go to, you go to, I go to YouTube to watch John Oliver.
[00:50:50.140 --> 00:50:55.020]   I, I, I, I, I haven't, you know, I've gotten over the TV.
[00:50:55.020 --> 00:50:56.620]   I don't have cable.
[00:50:56.620 --> 00:51:01.300]   And if I want to watch anything, I go to Amazon Netflix YouTube.
[00:51:01.300 --> 00:51:02.260]   OK.
[00:51:02.260 --> 00:51:04.740]   Well, Leo, you're hit on the exact right thing.
[00:51:04.740 --> 00:51:09.540]   Joshua Benton, who's brilliant at even Media Lab is on Twitter right now, talking about
[00:51:09.540 --> 00:51:12.700]   how it's going to break all your Js you've ever published, kill your YouTube
[00:51:12.700 --> 00:51:14.180]   embeds, break all your Twitter embeds.
[00:51:14.180 --> 00:51:15.460]   I don't think that's necessarily true.
[00:51:15.460 --> 00:51:16.100]   And so on.
[00:51:16.100 --> 00:51:20.420]   So, so the, well, they didn't deal with this morning, which is absolutely, what's the
[00:51:20.420 --> 00:51:22.380]   cost of this to people and how does it get done?
[00:51:22.380 --> 00:51:23.300]   I think that's a huge point.
[00:51:23.300 --> 00:51:24.140]   I think you're absolutely right.
[00:51:24.140 --> 00:51:29.900]   Well, what I see is if you're, if you are a content creator, you have kind of, you
[00:51:29.900 --> 00:51:30.580]   have two jobs.
[00:51:30.580 --> 00:51:34.340]   One is to create the content and then you're going to spend a significant amount
[00:51:34.340 --> 00:51:39.460]   of time putting that content in a form that can be consumed by.
[00:51:39.460 --> 00:51:42.780]   No, you're going to the, well, you're doing, you're doing, spending a significant amount
[00:51:42.780 --> 00:51:46.700]   of time doing that now to make a beautiful site and have a whole big, a lot of stuff.
[00:51:46.700 --> 00:51:49.820]   Well, you do the last actually once only thing that you then use that.
[00:51:49.820 --> 00:51:50.540]   Well, same thing here.
[00:51:50.540 --> 00:51:53.340]   You're going to, you're going to take this content and put it through a sieve to
[00:51:53.340 --> 00:51:56.700]   throw it through the problem is the web has been around for a while.
[00:51:56.700 --> 00:51:57.740]   It's Facebook today.
[00:51:57.740 --> 00:51:58.540]   It's YouTube today.
[00:51:58.540 --> 00:52:00.060]   Who knows what it's going to be tomorrow?
[00:52:00.060 --> 00:52:02.940]   Your audience is going to move around, right?
[00:52:03.060 --> 00:52:06.980]   You're going to make an architecture where you republish your stuff wherever it works.
[00:52:06.980 --> 00:52:08.100]   Now that now you can't just do that.
[00:52:08.100 --> 00:52:10.460]   I'm going to take the same 800 word article and put it there, right?
[00:52:10.460 --> 00:52:11.700]   Buzzfeed smarter than that.
[00:52:11.700 --> 00:52:14.660]   Uh, and you're going to say, I'm going to do something different for Snapchat that I'm
[00:52:14.660 --> 00:52:15.140]   going to do for here.
[00:52:15.140 --> 00:52:19.220]   Yes, you got to do appropriate to the context of the users need at that moment.
[00:52:19.220 --> 00:52:22.780]   But having said that, if you have the same 800 word article, what you're going to do
[00:52:22.780 --> 00:52:25.380]   is hit a button and it's going to go on to a web page, sure.
[00:52:25.380 --> 00:52:29.220]   And it's going to go on to a amp page and it's going to go on to a Facebook page.
[00:52:29.220 --> 00:52:32.620]   And it's going to go on to medium and it's going to go on to whatever else.
[00:52:32.980 --> 00:52:38.060]   And what you're setting up is that structure to publish once, uh, distribute many kind of
[00:52:38.060 --> 00:52:41.540]   interest is really no accident that when you, when you people talk about Vox, they
[00:52:41.540 --> 00:52:45.500]   talk less about the content of Vox and more about the platform of Vox.
[00:52:45.500 --> 00:52:48.940]   And that, well, yeah, bingo, but that says a content creator.
[00:52:48.940 --> 00:52:51.500]   That's kind of depressing because basically the same with Buzzfeed.
[00:52:51.500 --> 00:52:51.700]   Yes.
[00:52:51.700 --> 00:52:53.460]   And Buzzfeed has an old platform.
[00:52:53.460 --> 00:52:58.300]   It's who cares with the content is the content is frankly the least important part of
[00:52:58.300 --> 00:52:58.380]   it.
[00:52:58.380 --> 00:52:59.700]   It's about having the platform.
[00:52:59.700 --> 00:53:01.780]   Yeah, I get in this argument back and forth.
[00:53:02.460 --> 00:53:03.460]   Yeah, it is.
[00:53:03.460 --> 00:53:07.300]   This is where my friends Emily Bell and Clay Shorky and Jay Rosen will yell at me.
[00:53:07.300 --> 00:53:12.340]   And I don't want to misquote them, but a lot of people these days say, well, you, you
[00:53:12.340 --> 00:53:13.620]   have to have your own CMS.
[00:53:13.620 --> 00:53:17.220]   And I'm saying, no, we've messed that up and publishing lots and lots and lots of times.
[00:53:17.220 --> 00:53:22.380]   I go back to the year 1973 when the Tribune had such a disaster and I was there.
[00:53:22.380 --> 00:53:24.060]   They assigned their Pulitzer prize.
[00:53:24.060 --> 00:53:27.100]   We invest in reporters to investigate their own bad system.
[00:53:27.100 --> 00:53:28.500]   We think we know technology.
[00:53:28.500 --> 00:53:29.420]   We mess it up all the time.
[00:53:29.420 --> 00:53:31.060]   No, it's something more controversial here, Leo.
[00:53:31.340 --> 00:53:33.820]   In essence, what you're doing is you're seeding insane.
[00:53:33.820 --> 00:53:35.180]   Facebook is my CMS.
[00:53:35.180 --> 00:53:35.860]   Right.
[00:53:35.860 --> 00:53:37.740]   Google amp is my CMS.
[00:53:37.740 --> 00:53:38.100]   Right.
[00:53:38.100 --> 00:53:39.460]   That's scary.
[00:53:39.460 --> 00:53:44.420]   But, you know, if I get if you're going to start, if I were going to start a news
[00:53:44.420 --> 00:53:47.060]   service from absolute scratch then Kevin, you're right.
[00:53:47.060 --> 00:53:50.900]   I would like reportedly I was still make pages, but I would make them in this
[00:53:50.900 --> 00:53:52.940]   way where I would say, good.
[00:53:52.940 --> 00:53:54.860]   Yeah, I got a site, but it's more of an archive.
[00:53:54.860 --> 00:53:56.980]   It's more about what the hell is this thingy bait?
[00:53:56.980 --> 00:53:58.260]   Oh, I can go there and see what it is.
[00:53:58.260 --> 00:53:58.620]   Okay.
[00:53:58.620 --> 00:54:01.260]   But I really like it when I get to it on Facebook or I, oh, it came
[00:54:01.260 --> 00:54:01.980]   up again on Twitter.
[00:54:01.980 --> 00:54:03.260]   That's where we got to go.
[00:54:03.260 --> 00:54:04.340]   And we're not prepared for that.
[00:54:04.340 --> 00:54:06.420]   And when we do that, and here's the hard part.
[00:54:06.420 --> 00:54:09.740]   Here's what's absolutely missing from both Facebook and Google.
[00:54:09.740 --> 00:54:11.580]   And this is the critical thing that I say.
[00:54:11.580 --> 00:54:15.540]   We have no mechanism to have a direct relationship with you as an individual
[00:54:15.540 --> 00:54:18.620]   to know what your interests are, to be able to give you greater relevance and
[00:54:18.620 --> 00:54:18.940]   value.
[00:54:18.940 --> 00:54:23.580]   And if we don't get that, then we will indeed go out of business and we seed the
[00:54:23.580 --> 00:54:26.340]   entire value of what we do to those platforms.
[00:54:26.340 --> 00:54:30.260]   But if right now as they're trying to leapfrog each other and be our friends
[00:54:30.260 --> 00:54:33.660]   in publishing for this period of time, which again was caused by the Germans
[00:54:33.660 --> 00:54:37.060]   and caused by the publishers I've yelled about, they brought them to the table.
[00:54:37.060 --> 00:54:43.300]   Then what we have to negotiate for is interest data back to us in a way that
[00:54:43.300 --> 00:54:47.060]   respects privacy, gives users full transparency, that gives them full
[00:54:47.060 --> 00:54:48.460]   knowledge and control of what's what.
[00:54:48.460 --> 00:54:53.540]   I think about YouTube is in this.
[00:54:53.540 --> 00:54:56.700]   If you put your stuff on YouTube, you really devalue it.
[00:54:57.740 --> 00:55:00.260]   Of course, that's where your audience is, but it's very hard.
[00:55:00.260 --> 00:55:05.060]   YouTube now controls not only the content, but the monetization of the content.
[00:55:05.060 --> 00:55:06.980]   You've devalued yourself essentially.
[00:55:06.980 --> 00:55:12.140]   I could argue, Leo, that if you started this company today, you could do it.
[00:55:12.140 --> 00:55:13.580]   What would it look like to do it?
[00:55:13.580 --> 00:55:16.220]   You know, forgetting from what YouTube is about.
[00:55:16.220 --> 00:55:17.220]   I can tell you right now.
[00:55:17.220 --> 00:55:21.940]   And I understand John Oliver being on YouTube, but I think the goal is to push
[00:55:21.940 --> 00:55:23.500]   you back to the show, is it not?
[00:55:23.500 --> 00:55:27.340]   Or I mean, how do they feel if the only way you consume John Oliver is on
[00:55:27.340 --> 00:55:29.660]   YouTube? I don't think HBO's happy about that.
[00:55:29.660 --> 00:55:34.220]   I think they're still seeing it as a promotional vehicle.
[00:55:34.220 --> 00:55:37.900]   Oliver's probably a bad example because it is subscriber supported.
[00:55:37.900 --> 00:55:42.820]   But if you took Trevor Noah, the ads are in YouTube.
[00:55:42.820 --> 00:55:44.100]   They're just the clips.
[00:55:44.100 --> 00:55:48.220]   I like watching Trevor Noah on YouTube, but it doesn't benefit.
[00:55:48.220 --> 00:55:49.980]   There's ads there.
[00:55:49.980 --> 00:55:51.020]   Comedy Central.
[00:55:51.020 --> 00:55:52.700]   There's ads.
[00:55:52.700 --> 00:55:53.980]   There's YouTube ads.
[00:55:53.980 --> 00:55:54.980]   There's no Comedy Central.
[00:55:54.980 --> 00:55:56.380]   And they got a revenue split.
[00:55:56.380 --> 00:55:57.380]   That's what YouTube says.
[00:55:57.380 --> 00:55:58.740]   Huge share of.
[00:55:58.740 --> 00:56:01.420]   In fact, and it's very hard to monetize.
[00:56:01.420 --> 00:56:08.980]   But do you think that Trevor Noah, do you think the Daily Show makes as much money on YouTube as it makes on Comedy Central?
[00:56:08.980 --> 00:56:11.100]   But it's the wrong question.
[00:56:11.100 --> 00:56:12.700]   It's like saying, it's not the wrong question.
[00:56:12.700 --> 00:56:14.660]   Do you still sell cassette tapes?
[00:56:14.660 --> 00:56:15.980]   Yeah, I understand.
[00:56:15.980 --> 00:56:16.820]   I just reality.
[00:56:16.820 --> 00:56:24.420]   OK, then you then you really devalue in content intensely and it becomes all about the platform and the platform owner makes all the money.
[00:56:24.780 --> 00:56:28.180]   And I can and then it's slavery for the content.
[00:56:28.180 --> 00:56:29.020]   It's a feudal.
[00:56:29.020 --> 00:56:29.860]   It's a very good business.
[00:56:29.860 --> 00:56:31.380]   It's a it's a for doing right now.
[00:56:31.380 --> 00:56:32.260]   It's not content.
[00:56:32.260 --> 00:56:33.140]   We're doing right now.
[00:56:33.140 --> 00:56:33.780]   It's in content.
[00:56:33.780 --> 00:56:38.060]   What we have to recognize in media is it's a relationship business and we don't see that yet.
[00:56:38.060 --> 00:56:42.700]   Those platforms and what I think the platforms understand is it's a feudal system
[00:56:42.700 --> 00:56:46.820]   and they own the big domains and they're going to let you work in the fields.
[00:56:46.820 --> 00:56:48.260]   And thank you very much.
[00:56:48.260 --> 00:56:49.500]   That was our time to negotiate.
[00:56:49.500 --> 00:56:50.420]   Now that's what I'm saying.
[00:56:50.420 --> 00:56:52.060]   Now is our time.
[00:56:52.060 --> 00:56:53.180]   How can we negotiate?
[00:56:53.940 --> 00:56:58.820]   We already lost because again, they need our content.
[00:56:58.820 --> 00:57:01.540]   They need our friendliness in Europe.
[00:57:01.540 --> 00:57:05.220]   I think there's always going to be somebody who'll be glad to be a surf.
[00:57:05.220 --> 00:57:12.540]   But yes, the other is going to be famous.
[00:57:12.540 --> 00:57:14.660]   Yeah, yes.
[00:57:14.660 --> 00:57:16.660]   So you're sorry.
[00:57:16.660 --> 00:57:19.260]   The other half of this is you don't know who's going to be successful and who's going to be famous.
[00:57:19.260 --> 00:57:23.820]   And that is the the other half of the media equation is you're never quite sure what's going to take off.
[00:57:23.820 --> 00:57:24.700]   And what's going to crash.
[00:57:24.700 --> 00:57:37.100]   And that has been amplified by the by the Facebookization and buzz fieldization of everything in that somebody did a very good article about this a couple of months ago where they said what are the most popular things on Facebook.
[00:57:37.100 --> 00:57:40.180]   If you look at it from month to month, there's no patent to it at all.
[00:57:40.180 --> 00:57:45.660]   It is it is just like noise and something's taken from something stone and the buzzfeeds and so on.
[00:57:45.660 --> 00:57:49.340]   The signal they're chasing the zeitgeist and trying to work out what it is that will get them there this month.
[00:57:49.340 --> 00:57:52.780]   Well, I for one don't want to work on Maggie's farm anymore.
[00:57:52.780 --> 00:57:55.900]   We're going to take a break and change the subject.
[00:57:55.900 --> 00:57:57.260]   Well, there's lots more to talk about.
[00:57:57.260 --> 00:57:58.860]   Jeff Jarvis is here.
[00:57:58.860 --> 00:58:00.460]   He's passionate about this.
[00:58:00.460 --> 00:58:09.900]   As you can see, and Kevin Marks and our show today brought to you by fresh books.
[00:58:09.900 --> 00:58:11.460]   We're mugging both of us.
[00:58:11.460 --> 00:58:12.700]   I know you're so funny.
[00:58:12.700 --> 00:58:14.020]   You guys correct me.
[00:58:14.020 --> 00:58:17.100]   Fresh books is here's a pop quiz for you freelancers.
[00:58:17.780 --> 00:58:28.580]   Those of you who make your living billing for time and expense and expertise, which of the following tasks represent your favorite part of freelancing formatting and sending invoices.
[00:58:28.580 --> 00:58:36.020]   Oh, I love doing that collecting receipts, tracking expenses, following up with clients who don't pay you on time.
[00:58:36.020 --> 00:58:36.860]   Look, let's face it.
[00:58:36.860 --> 00:58:37.980]   None of the above.
[00:58:37.980 --> 00:58:41.420]   Those are all the worst parts of being a freelancer.
[00:58:41.420 --> 00:58:44.700]   Fresh books makes it fun.
[00:58:44.940 --> 00:58:47.460]   I know that's hard to believe it makes it easy.
[00:58:47.460 --> 00:58:50.620]   And most importantly to you, it gets you paid faster.
[00:58:50.620 --> 00:58:59.980]   Fresh books is a simple cloud as accounting service that's giving thousands of freelancers like you the tools you need to save time building it get paid faster.
[00:58:59.980 --> 00:59:01.060]   It's very easy.
[00:59:01.060 --> 00:59:02.540]   It's not for numbers people.
[00:59:02.540 --> 00:59:09.020]   You don't have to be a numbers person, although your accountant or if you're your accountant, you will love the reports you get from fresh books.
[00:59:09.020 --> 00:59:14.100]   But the real simple process of creating and sending invoices.
[00:59:14.540 --> 00:59:15.780]   Getting paid faster.
[00:59:15.780 --> 00:59:21.900]   Fresh books, even automatically, let's slow pays no and set and hurry them up.
[00:59:21.900 --> 00:59:23.220]   You will get paid faster.
[00:59:23.220 --> 00:59:26.340]   People actually just hate paying as much as you hate billing.
[00:59:26.340 --> 00:59:28.500]   It just streamlines the whole process.
[00:59:28.500 --> 00:59:29.380]   Everybody's happy.
[00:59:29.380 --> 00:59:32.900]   And if you ever have a question, help is free forever.
[00:59:32.900 --> 00:59:34.100]   You can always count on them.
[00:59:34.100 --> 00:59:37.740]   The Fresh Books award winning support rock stars are great.
[00:59:37.740 --> 00:59:39.740]   Fresh books saved my life.

[01:00:00.380 --> 01:00:03.380]   Freshbooks.com/twig.
[01:00:03.380 --> 01:00:06.860]   All right.
[01:00:06.860 --> 01:00:08.980]   What do you want to talk about next?
[01:00:08.980 --> 01:00:10.300]   I'm going to let you guys choose.
[01:00:11.500 --> 01:00:14.180]   I knew I knew we'd amped would be the subject.
[01:00:14.180 --> 01:00:18.060]   And in fact, I came in with an open mind and it was closed by the discussion.
[01:00:18.060 --> 01:00:20.340]   Yeah, that's good.
[01:00:20.340 --> 01:00:21.220]   Then we had Kevin here.
[01:00:21.220 --> 01:00:23.020]   Kevin actually knows his stuff and I know.
[01:00:23.020 --> 01:00:23.700]   Well, it's perfect.
[01:00:23.700 --> 01:00:28.060]   No, it's perfect because I think you understand the issues faces publishers are facing.
[01:00:28.060 --> 01:00:28.860]   All right.
[01:00:28.860 --> 01:00:30.540]   So that's what while we're on controversial stuff.
[01:00:30.540 --> 01:00:31.740]   Let's go back to Europe.
[01:00:31.740 --> 01:00:32.740]   OK.
[01:00:32.740 --> 01:00:35.300]   The top European court.
[01:00:35.300 --> 01:00:37.300]   Turned out.
[01:00:37.300 --> 01:00:39.020]   Oh, it's a biggie.
[01:00:39.020 --> 01:00:39.580]   It's a biggie.
[01:00:39.580 --> 01:00:42.860]   The safe harbor data safe harbor has been killed by the European court.
[01:00:42.860 --> 01:00:48.220]   So what this means is that any American technology company who's operating in Europe is going to have to
[01:00:48.220 --> 01:00:51.660]   show a store use your data in Europe and it gets worse.
[01:00:51.660 --> 01:00:56.140]   Oh, but wait, there's more because there is no single standard across all of Europe.
[01:00:56.140 --> 01:01:02.140]   They're going to have to treat each of the 20, however many countries it is, 27, 29 differently.
[01:01:02.140 --> 01:01:05.580]   So if you're in France, you're going to store the data in France in a certain way.
[01:01:05.580 --> 01:01:07.780]   And if you're in Germany, you're going to store it in Germany in a certain way.
[01:01:07.780 --> 01:01:12.580]   You're going to figure out who the heck is from where and what rules their data has.
[01:01:12.580 --> 01:01:13.980]   And you're not allowed to bring it here.
[01:01:13.980 --> 01:01:15.460]   Thank you, NSA.
[01:01:15.460 --> 01:01:19.620]   I mean, I'll blame the European court for what I think is could be potentially disastrous decision.
[01:01:19.620 --> 01:01:24.780]   But I certainly understand why it's there because our dear American government and the NSA
[01:01:24.780 --> 01:01:28.260]   spooked the world literally on this.
[01:01:28.260 --> 01:01:29.580]   This is not appealable.
[01:01:29.580 --> 01:01:35.060]   It's another one of those situations where if you're a Facebook and Google and, you know, I was talking to
[01:01:35.300 --> 01:01:39.740]   somebody from an analytics company today, if you look at the caching that's going to be done
[01:01:39.740 --> 01:01:41.700]   for AMP pages, not to go back to that.
[01:01:41.700 --> 01:01:44.060]   You know, how does that get done country by country?
[01:01:44.060 --> 01:01:45.260]   How do you split up your data?
[01:01:45.260 --> 01:01:49.100]   Part of the irony here is I'm going to have to say to you, do you live in France?
[01:01:49.100 --> 01:01:52.100]   I'm going to have to cookie you so I don't cookie you because I need to cookie you to say
[01:01:52.100 --> 01:01:55.060]   where I store your stuff so I don't store your stuff.
[01:01:55.060 --> 01:01:58.740]   Please check a box as to which country you are in.
[01:01:58.740 --> 01:02:01.180]   Don't worry.
[01:02:01.180 --> 01:02:04.980]   We won't remember that the next time you come here is you'll have to check the box again.
[01:02:05.460 --> 01:02:11.300]   This all comes from Max Shremms, who's an Austrian, I believe, who has made a big, big campaign
[01:02:11.300 --> 01:02:12.980]   against Facebook and he won.
[01:02:12.980 --> 01:02:17.420]   And I wrote Stoden said, Oh, great victory from the court and Shremms.
[01:02:17.420 --> 01:02:21.100]   Congratulations because it's anti NSA, but it's also anti-silicon Valley.
[01:02:21.100 --> 01:02:25.260]   And I potentially really, really difficult way.
[01:02:25.260 --> 01:02:27.060]   And they're just like great to be forgotten.
[01:02:27.060 --> 01:02:31.180]   There are these implications to these decisions that are just simply not thought through.
[01:02:31.180 --> 01:02:33.380]   And it's a oh time.
[01:02:34.380 --> 01:02:35.620]   Any reaction?
[01:02:35.620 --> 01:02:39.940]   I worry that we're going to get to this point where you just we're going backwards where the
[01:02:39.940 --> 01:02:44.900]   national borders will not only stop traffic and people, but it'll stop data.
[01:02:44.900 --> 01:02:46.820]   You know, that's exactly what this means.
[01:02:46.820 --> 01:02:47.900]   All kinds of.
[01:02:47.900 --> 01:02:52.340]   Right. Well, that's yeah, the challenge here is that it's a jurisdiction issue.
[01:02:52.340 --> 01:02:54.700]   It's a it's a which country's law reply to this data.
[01:02:54.700 --> 01:02:59.500]   And they've had this sort of hand wave that says, Oh, we, you can do what you like.
[01:02:59.500 --> 01:03:00.500]   We won't worry about that.
[01:03:00.940 --> 01:03:04.220]   And this has come home to roost now because they had because there are very different laws
[01:03:04.220 --> 01:03:10.460]   in the US and the EU about how companies are supposed to handle personal identity.
[01:03:10.460 --> 01:03:12.380]   So what we need is an international treaty.
[01:03:12.380 --> 01:03:16.460]   Yeah, because those go so well.
[01:03:16.460 --> 01:03:17.660]   Like TPP.
[01:03:17.660 --> 01:03:19.500]   Well, but that's what those things are for, right?
[01:03:19.500 --> 01:03:22.980]   Resolving differences in national laws.
[01:03:22.980 --> 01:03:26.380]   That would be that would be a way to do this and where to handle this and that the
[01:03:26.380 --> 01:03:27.020]   challenge is.
[01:03:27.020 --> 01:03:27.980]   No, this was a treaty.
[01:03:27.980 --> 01:03:29.140]   This was an agreement.
[01:03:29.140 --> 01:03:30.500]   That was the point, but it got rejected.
[01:03:31.180 --> 01:03:34.420]   It was an international safe harbor because it violated.
[01:03:34.420 --> 01:03:36.700]   It wasn't actually a treaty was an agreement.
[01:03:36.700 --> 01:03:40.420]   I mean, it was a member of understanding, I think, but it was.
[01:03:40.420 --> 01:03:46.060]   But the point is that the the you're just just like the US Supreme Court will
[01:03:46.060 --> 01:03:49.500]   occasionally say something that affects lots of businesses.
[01:03:49.500 --> 01:03:51.900]   The EU court has just done one of those here.
[01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:57.180]   And so they've they will now have to either legislate at the EU level to try and
[01:03:57.180 --> 01:04:01.060]   work this out or and in the meantime, there'll be a lot of chaos and noises.
[01:04:01.060 --> 01:04:02.100]   They try and work out what's going on.
[01:04:02.100 --> 01:04:07.380]   By the way, don't blame Snowden for this blame for the NSA for this.
[01:04:07.380 --> 01:04:08.540]   No, just feel it.
[01:04:08.540 --> 01:04:11.500]   I just said I blame the NSA.
[01:04:11.500 --> 01:04:12.140]   I don't know.
[01:04:12.140 --> 01:04:15.100]   And there are people in the chatroom and said, Oh, Snowden, that trader.
[01:04:15.100 --> 01:04:16.380]   No, Snowden just.
[01:04:16.380 --> 01:04:21.460]   But I just I disagree with snow that this is an unalloyed victory for good sense.
[01:04:21.460 --> 01:04:23.140]   Yes, it's a victory against the NSA.
[01:04:23.140 --> 01:04:24.100]   Yes, it's a slap against them.
[01:04:24.100 --> 01:04:27.540]   But if you see a larger picture of the world and I understand why he doesn't,
[01:04:27.540 --> 01:04:30.220]   then then I think it still brings issues.
[01:04:30.220 --> 01:04:33.780]   Is there any way to solve this?
[01:04:33.780 --> 01:04:36.500]   This is the challenge.
[01:04:36.500 --> 01:04:40.300]   So the challenge has been that the NSA had was supposed to not
[01:04:40.300 --> 01:04:44.820]   spy on American persons, but was allowed to spy on overseas persons.
[01:04:44.820 --> 01:04:49.540]   And the the British and the Germans had the opposite law and the
[01:04:49.540 --> 01:04:51.660]   bunch of the others as well.
[01:04:51.860 --> 01:04:55.220]   And so what they would then do was just spy on each other and exchange
[01:04:55.220 --> 01:04:56.300]   jelly with each other.
[01:04:56.300 --> 01:05:00.060]   So this is sort of this is partly closing that loophole.
[01:05:00.060 --> 01:05:05.340]   So this is this is saying, OK, the fact that the Americans allowed to
[01:05:05.340 --> 01:05:10.380]   spy on Europeans in American law, but we just we decided we're actually going
[01:05:10.380 --> 01:05:13.380]   to force the European law about this and probably the revelations about
[01:05:13.380 --> 01:05:17.540]   the NSA tapping the Greek Prime Minister's phone and the German Prime
[01:05:17.540 --> 01:05:21.340]   Minister's phone and those those kinds of things are a part of this.
[01:05:21.340 --> 01:05:25.380]   Because the European EU politicians and the judges are not going to be
[01:05:25.380 --> 01:05:27.540]   comfortable with with that point of view.
[01:05:27.540 --> 01:05:30.820]   And part of that is, yes, there's some anti-Americanism going on there.
[01:05:30.820 --> 01:05:34.620]   But part of it is the NSA has ridiculously overstepped the bounds of what's
[01:05:34.620 --> 01:05:38.940]   reasonable and aggrandized all data in the world to itself.
[01:05:38.940 --> 01:05:41.740]   And so this is this is the stuff that the push back against that.
[01:05:41.740 --> 01:05:45.660]   And the collateral damage is that a lot of these companies that depend on
[01:05:45.660 --> 01:05:48.780]   tracking data are going to be up against it too.
[01:05:48.980 --> 01:05:54.060]   So in another way, this is another blow against the sort of ad tech noise,
[01:05:54.060 --> 01:05:58.340]   but it's but it's also potentially more of a blow because a lot of ad
[01:05:58.340 --> 01:06:01.860]   tech stuff isn't actually a PI, although someone that is in the sketchy
[01:06:01.860 --> 01:06:03.020]   parts of it are.
[01:06:03.020 --> 01:06:08.700]   The this is also going to be complicated for the Facebook and Google and so on,
[01:06:08.700 --> 01:06:11.620]   because they're going to have to work out how to partition their data centers
[01:06:11.620 --> 01:06:13.980]   and work out what they can move between them.
[01:06:13.980 --> 01:06:15.660]   And it's not just the data center itself.
[01:06:15.660 --> 01:06:18.620]   It's also the structure of how do you either the lawyers are going to be
[01:06:18.620 --> 01:06:21.940]   going hey, they on this because how do you protect yourself from liability to
[01:06:21.940 --> 01:06:23.380]   say, Oh, that's a French person.
[01:06:23.380 --> 01:06:26.180]   And I know that's a French person, but I don't know it.
[01:06:26.180 --> 01:06:28.380]   And this is how I have to behave with their data.
[01:06:28.380 --> 01:06:33.460]   Yeah, but you know, for an again, it's a scale thing.
[01:06:33.460 --> 01:06:36.620]   So Facebook and Google already have European data centers because they do it
[01:06:36.620 --> 01:06:37.460]   for latency reasons.
[01:06:37.460 --> 01:06:39.580]   And but the data.
[01:06:39.580 --> 01:06:42.020]   So what Kevin, don't be wrong.
[01:06:42.020 --> 01:06:42.980]   They tend to be mirrors.
[01:06:42.980 --> 01:06:44.100]   Yeah. Exactly.
[01:06:44.100 --> 01:06:45.540]   They're you know, they're flows freely.
[01:06:45.540 --> 01:06:48.540]   There's no there's no partitioning of saying, uh-huh, that's European data
[01:06:48.540 --> 01:06:49.740]   that can't come to the US.
[01:06:49.740 --> 01:06:52.660]   And then what does it mean to come to the US?
[01:06:52.660 --> 01:06:57.900]   You know, the other question is, so I'm a French reader of the New York Times.
[01:06:57.900 --> 01:07:02.340]   So the New York Times has to worry about this too.
[01:07:02.340 --> 01:07:03.700]   It's not just Google and Facebook.
[01:07:03.700 --> 01:07:06.460]   The New York Times has said, how am I going to serve that reader?
[01:07:06.460 --> 01:07:09.300]   And I've got, you know, American airline advertisers.
[01:07:09.300 --> 01:07:12.140]   I want to send to them and I've got American content and I serve it for my
[01:07:12.140 --> 01:07:13.140]   American servers.
[01:07:13.140 --> 01:07:15.940]   And now you're telling me, like, have these problems?
[01:07:15.940 --> 01:07:17.020]   It's it's.
[01:07:17.020 --> 01:07:17.540]   Wow.
[01:07:18.540 --> 01:07:21.580]   We can talk about something happier now, but okay.
[01:07:21.580 --> 01:07:24.620]   Vladimir Putin celebrating his 63rd birthday.
[01:07:24.620 --> 01:07:26.980]   I'm telling you, Google.
[01:07:26.980 --> 01:07:27.980]   Act better.
[01:07:27.980 --> 01:07:31.420]   Now I wouldn't have known about it if it weren't for this fabulous new feature.
[01:07:31.420 --> 01:07:32.620]   Thank you, Jack Dorsey.
[01:07:32.620 --> 01:07:34.220]   It's called Twitter Moments.
[01:07:34.220 --> 01:07:38.380]   It's funny because we know we knew we've talked about this for a long time.
[01:07:38.380 --> 01:07:41.380]   Twitter has been working on this and then Jack Dorsey becomes CEO and boom.
[01:07:41.380 --> 01:07:41.860]   It comes out.
[01:07:41.860 --> 01:07:42.180]   I have it.
[01:07:42.180 --> 01:07:44.380]   You got a feeling that maybe Jack said, what do you got?
[01:07:44.380 --> 01:07:45.340]   What do you got in the closet?
[01:07:45.340 --> 01:07:46.780]   Let that out.
[01:07:46.780 --> 01:07:47.540]   Maybe you look good.
[01:07:47.540 --> 01:07:48.340]   Let that out.
[01:07:48.340 --> 01:07:51.980]   So you didn't sound too happy about it.
[01:07:51.980 --> 01:07:55.420]   I have to say it's not the web page doesn't really bring it to life.
[01:07:55.420 --> 01:07:57.460]   I think Facebook Moments is really designed for the.
[01:07:57.460 --> 01:08:01.380]   I'm sorry, in Twitter Moments is really designed for the.
[01:08:01.380 --> 01:08:03.700]   The mobile experience.
[01:08:03.700 --> 01:08:03.940]   What is that?
[01:08:03.940 --> 01:08:04.460]   You found it.
[01:08:04.460 --> 01:08:05.700]   Here's it's man.
[01:08:05.700 --> 01:08:06.460]   All right.
[01:08:06.460 --> 01:08:09.740]   So I already know that 6,000 prisoners to be released.
[01:08:09.740 --> 01:08:10.620]   So I saw that.
[01:08:10.620 --> 01:08:11.580]   Let me describe what it is.
[01:08:11.580 --> 01:08:19.100]   It's a curated special tab on your Twitter client desktop or mobile that contains.
[01:08:19.100 --> 01:08:23.900]   Selected by a human, not not because you follow people.
[01:08:23.900 --> 01:08:31.220]   It's not people you follow tweets in in a variety of areas, news, sports, entertainment, fun.
[01:08:31.220 --> 01:08:35.820]   And then there's a today tab, which is, you know, there's overlap, but this is today's news.
[01:08:35.820 --> 01:08:39.100]   It very much, if you're on mobile, very much has that.
[01:08:40.060 --> 01:08:41.860]   Snapchat look to it.
[01:08:41.860 --> 01:08:44.700]   So when you click a story, you swipe right.
[01:08:44.700 --> 01:08:49.140]   To see tweets and obviously this picture in video heavy.
[01:08:49.140 --> 01:08:50.540]   Putin.
[01:08:50.540 --> 01:08:57.380]   So for instance, Italian cell phone company caviar made a special $6, $3,000 iPhone
[01:08:57.380 --> 01:09:01.780]   six with the golden head of Vladimir Putin on it, obviously kissing up.
[01:09:01.780 --> 01:09:08.580]   Putin celebrated with playing heis hockey against NHL stars, unaccountably scoring seven
[01:09:08.580 --> 01:09:09.940]   straight goals.
[01:09:09.940 --> 01:09:15.900]   Apparently nobody wanted to be the guy who blocked.
[01:09:15.900 --> 01:09:17.420]   I think the goalie just went home.
[01:09:17.420 --> 01:09:21.500]   And so this is so this is an example.
[01:09:21.500 --> 01:09:23.340]   It's very Snapchat discovery.
[01:09:23.340 --> 01:09:25.300]   And then when you go on, you can read other stories.
[01:09:25.300 --> 01:09:28.580]   And then when you get the end, it says you cut up, check later today for updates
[01:09:28.580 --> 01:09:33.780]   or swipe more to explore and you swipe and you'll get news, sports, entertainment.
[01:09:33.780 --> 01:09:35.140]   Fun.
[01:09:35.140 --> 01:09:37.620]   It's it reminds me a lot of Snapchat.
[01:09:37.620 --> 01:09:38.900]   So what do you think, Jeff?
[01:09:38.900 --> 01:09:41.340]   Meh, meh.
[01:09:41.340 --> 01:09:45.420]   You know, the the I mean, fine.
[01:09:45.420 --> 01:09:48.940]   And I understand what they're trying to do with it, but it's kind of going against
[01:09:48.940 --> 01:09:51.100]   Twitter. It's it's creating a mass experience.
[01:09:51.100 --> 01:09:52.180]   Everything the same for everybody.
[01:09:52.180 --> 01:09:54.460]   Maybe they'll maybe they'll make it more relevant in the future.
[01:09:54.460 --> 01:10:01.260]   But you know, so I know that I already know most of what I see in the news tab.
[01:10:01.260 --> 01:10:03.740]   Because I'm a news guy and so I read lots of news.
[01:10:03.740 --> 01:10:04.420]   But you're on you.
[01:10:04.420 --> 01:10:05.660]   So so I'm usual.
[01:10:05.660 --> 01:10:06.420]   That's fine.
[01:10:06.420 --> 01:10:09.980]   So I go to the entertainment tab and I say, OK, there may be something there.
[01:10:09.980 --> 01:10:13.860]   But you know, one of the things there is that homeland has its premiere.
[01:10:13.860 --> 01:10:15.660]   Well, yes, that was three nights ago.
[01:10:15.660 --> 01:10:16.540]   Right.
[01:10:16.540 --> 01:10:20.540]   And when I look at that, I see half dozen tweets from people I don't know.
[01:10:20.540 --> 01:10:24.460]   That's kind of meanless to me that tells me that, yeah, OK, so carries back.
[01:10:24.460 --> 01:10:31.540]   And I mean, what I think we have to go back to say, what's the user need for this
[01:10:31.540 --> 01:10:32.740]   experience?
[01:10:32.740 --> 01:10:34.900]   What Twitter is saying in parties, we need to get people into Twitter who
[01:10:34.900 --> 01:10:35.900]   are only friends on Twitter.
[01:10:35.900 --> 01:10:37.780]   So we got to give them something and I get that.
[01:10:37.780 --> 01:10:41.580]   The little guy like this at the top.
[01:10:41.580 --> 01:10:43.100]   Right.
[01:10:43.100 --> 01:10:45.860]   I mean, what I like on Twitter is the fact that there's people I know whose
[01:10:45.860 --> 01:10:47.620]   wit and views I appreciate.
[01:10:47.620 --> 01:10:49.540]   That's your your OK, so you're an experience.
[01:10:49.540 --> 01:10:52.940]   So this is not probably for the experience Twitter user.
[01:10:52.940 --> 01:10:56.660]   I think I can imagine the discussion that went on on Twitter, which is how do we
[01:10:56.660 --> 01:11:00.220]   people use Twitter, they sign up, they look at it, they don't understand what
[01:11:00.220 --> 01:11:00.860]   they're getting.
[01:11:00.940 --> 01:11:05.900]   They try the suggested user list to help you craft a feed that has something you
[01:11:05.900 --> 01:11:06.900]   want in it.
[01:11:06.900 --> 01:11:07.980]   People don't get Twitter.
[01:11:07.980 --> 01:11:09.860]   We're not growing very fast anymore.
[01:11:09.860 --> 01:11:13.980]   What if we surface the best content on Twitter in one of these?
[01:11:13.980 --> 01:11:16.460]   So is this the way I want to find out that story?
[01:11:16.460 --> 01:11:16.820]   Right.
[01:11:16.820 --> 01:11:18.900]   So so Texas executed another person.
[01:11:18.900 --> 01:11:19.980]   I look at that those tweets.
[01:11:19.980 --> 01:11:21.740]   It's not as good as a news story.
[01:11:21.740 --> 01:11:25.260]   I mean, I say we've got to move past the article and change the article and change
[01:11:25.260 --> 01:11:25.660]   all this stuff.
[01:11:25.660 --> 01:11:26.060]   Fine.
[01:11:26.060 --> 01:11:27.980]   So I'm all open to new forms.
[01:11:28.140 --> 01:11:31.780]   But if you sit back and say, is this a superior experience to find out about that
[01:11:31.780 --> 01:11:33.220]   news? Well, weren't you?
[01:11:33.220 --> 01:11:35.180]   Maybe I want maybe I'm mistaken.
[01:11:35.180 --> 01:11:38.220]   You weren't big on Snapchat discovery, either, right?
[01:11:38.220 --> 01:11:38.660]   Or were you?
[01:11:38.660 --> 01:11:39.300]   No, I liked it.
[01:11:39.300 --> 01:11:39.660]   I liked it.
[01:11:39.660 --> 01:11:42.460]   So to me, it's exactly the same thing.
[01:11:42.460 --> 01:11:44.420]   A brand, not my friends.
[01:11:44.420 --> 01:11:46.460]   A brand creates a Snapchat.
[01:11:46.460 --> 01:11:47.500]   I think I'm going to have to look at it.
[01:11:47.500 --> 01:11:48.980]   And they do it much better job producing it.
[01:11:48.980 --> 01:11:52.540]   Well, OK, this is maybe that's just took it's going to take a better
[01:11:52.540 --> 01:11:53.500]   experience to do it.
[01:11:53.500 --> 01:11:56.100]   X the brands created for Snapchat.
[01:11:56.100 --> 01:12:01.060]   So at the end of the day, what's the value I get out of this as a user in the long
[01:12:01.060 --> 01:12:01.380]   run?
[01:12:01.380 --> 01:12:03.780]   The true what's the essence of Twitter?
[01:12:03.780 --> 01:12:05.060]   Right.
[01:12:05.060 --> 01:12:08.620]   So so to me, what's what to me to make that bridge work?
[01:12:08.620 --> 01:12:11.740]   What you've got to do is to say, I know you're interested here, stuff.
[01:12:11.740 --> 01:12:13.780]   You'd be interested in and give me a relevant Twitter.
[01:12:13.780 --> 01:12:15.060]   Twitter has to be relevant to me.
[01:12:15.060 --> 01:12:17.380]   Any old bozo talking I don't care about.
[01:12:17.380 --> 01:12:20.860]   I want to think is there is somehow relevant to me because I know the
[01:12:20.860 --> 01:12:23.500]   music of the topic is I care about the topic because what if you're a new user?
[01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:26.060]   How do they know what's relevant to you as a new user?
[01:12:26.940 --> 01:12:35.100]   I mean, you'll be excited through Facebook and Facebook signals.
[01:12:35.100 --> 01:12:42.500]   So so here's the discovered to I feel like this is kind of a similar idea.
[01:12:42.500 --> 01:12:44.860]   I mean, you know, it's a little more brand focused.
[01:12:44.860 --> 01:12:48.260]   So a brand is going to be more likely and they and the brands, of course,
[01:12:48.260 --> 01:12:50.660]   create the content.
[01:12:50.660 --> 01:12:52.220]   So the content might be a little bit better.
[01:12:52.220 --> 01:12:56.020]   Certainly the brand has an incentive to do to do that.
[01:12:57.020 --> 01:13:00.580]   Here's another way that they say, by the way, Snapchat says this is hugely successful.
[01:13:00.580 --> 01:13:01.220]   Yes.
[01:13:01.220 --> 01:13:03.380]   I hear huge traffic to publishers.
[01:13:03.380 --> 01:13:05.340]   Great traffic of great engagement.
[01:13:05.340 --> 01:13:06.580]   So here's the question.
[01:13:06.580 --> 01:13:12.860]   Lee, another way to pose the question is the essence of Twitter to give me a news
[01:13:12.860 --> 01:13:16.260]   fact or the essence of Twitter to give me to link me to a person.
[01:13:16.260 --> 01:13:17.060]   I'm going to find interesting.
[01:13:17.060 --> 01:13:18.420]   Well, here's the problem for Twitter.
[01:13:18.420 --> 01:13:20.380]   No one freaking knows.
[01:13:20.380 --> 01:13:21.460]   Yeah.
[01:13:21.460 --> 01:13:24.780]   So they've got to figure out a way to grow because.
[01:13:24.780 --> 01:13:28.900]   I mean, you and I, but when would you start using it?
[01:13:28.900 --> 01:13:30.620]   2007 probably, right?
[01:13:30.620 --> 01:13:35.020]   I mean, we've had a lot of time to get cultivate our feed and understand that's different.
[01:13:35.020 --> 01:13:36.460]   I understand didn't grow and I get that.
[01:13:36.460 --> 01:13:38.740]   But but again, what's the essence of Twitter?
[01:13:38.740 --> 01:13:40.700]   What if you're going to promote what the essence is?
[01:13:40.700 --> 01:13:42.420]   Well, I'll be honest with you.
[01:13:42.420 --> 01:13:43.740]   I look at my Twitter feed.
[01:13:43.740 --> 01:13:45.020]   It's a disjointed mess.
[01:13:45.020 --> 01:13:49.820]   It looks like people are speaking and strum, you know, they've had strokes or they're speaking
[01:13:49.820 --> 01:13:51.140]   some strange language.
[01:13:51.140 --> 01:13:51.500]   I don't.
[01:13:51.500 --> 01:13:53.500]   It's it's a disjointed mess.
[01:13:53.860 --> 01:13:54.740]   I made a list.
[01:13:54.740 --> 01:13:58.380]   I don't even look at my main feed anymore because it's too messy to fix.
[01:13:58.380 --> 01:14:00.900]   I have a list of media walks that I hear.
[01:14:00.900 --> 01:14:01.500]   I agree with you.
[01:14:01.500 --> 01:14:03.900]   I mean, this is this is almost like a completely sev.
[01:14:03.900 --> 01:14:05.460]   This is flip board, basically.
[01:14:05.460 --> 01:14:07.500]   It's a completely separate product.
[01:14:07.500 --> 01:14:10.420]   Rather than getting a New York Times story, I get one tweet that says,
[01:14:10.420 --> 01:14:13.580]   repeats five times the guy was killed, the guy was killed, the guy was, yeah, I know.
[01:14:13.580 --> 01:14:14.820]   Right.
[01:14:14.820 --> 01:14:18.860]   So I'm sympathetic to what Twitter is trying to do.
[01:14:18.860 --> 01:14:22.940]   But I just think you've got to pull back and say, what are we really like?
[01:14:22.940 --> 01:14:25.580]   Google always knows they started off today to say it.
[01:14:25.580 --> 01:14:29.020]   We organize the world's information to make it universally accessible.
[01:14:29.020 --> 01:14:30.140]   That's what we do.
[01:14:30.140 --> 01:14:33.980]   Everything we do fits under that Facebook connects people.
[01:14:33.980 --> 01:14:35.540]   So what is Twitter?
[01:14:35.540 --> 01:14:38.140]   Yeah, well, I don't think they've answered that much.
[01:14:38.140 --> 01:14:39.980]   You think Jack Dorsey is the guy to answer that.
[01:14:39.980 --> 01:14:41.340]   I think it's just it's the same problem.
[01:14:41.340 --> 01:14:42.900]   Listen, how many years do we go through?
[01:14:42.900 --> 01:14:43.700]   What is Yahoo?
[01:14:43.700 --> 01:14:44.220]   Right.
[01:14:44.220 --> 01:14:46.780]   Yahoo doesn't know again and again and again.
[01:14:46.780 --> 01:14:47.580]   They didn't know this still.
[01:14:47.580 --> 01:14:47.980]   No, no.
[01:14:47.980 --> 01:14:48.340]   Yeah.
[01:14:48.340 --> 01:14:50.140]   I would say the same problem exists for Twitter.
[01:14:50.660 --> 01:14:53.060]   This looks like Yahoo as well, which is the other thing that's kind of scary.
[01:14:53.060 --> 01:14:53.620]   That's true.
[01:14:53.620 --> 01:14:57.340]   Well, it does on the web.
[01:14:57.340 --> 01:14:59.580]   Let's look at the web page because this is the same content.
[01:14:59.580 --> 01:15:04.700]   But when you look at on the web, the website is very, it's very much a portally
[01:15:04.700 --> 01:15:06.860]   kind of a lot of wasted space.
[01:15:06.860 --> 01:15:09.660]   And if I want to come in as a user and say, what's going on today?
[01:15:09.660 --> 01:15:11.900]   Give me 15 top headlines.
[01:15:11.900 --> 01:15:13.740]   Am I going to do it through this?
[01:15:13.740 --> 01:15:15.580]   Or for them, am I going to go to a little fashion?
[01:15:15.580 --> 01:15:16.860]   I think it's more engaging.
[01:15:16.860 --> 01:15:19.620]   I think it's more engaging on mobile than it is on the on the.
[01:15:19.620 --> 01:15:20.860]   I'm using it on mobile right now.
[01:15:20.860 --> 01:15:25.220]   Now, if I go to the entertainment tab, that's a little better because it's more
[01:15:25.220 --> 01:15:26.220]   serendipitous.
[01:15:26.220 --> 01:15:28.020]   Was also more entertaining.
[01:15:28.020 --> 01:15:30.260]   Tom Hanks finds student ID.
[01:15:30.260 --> 01:15:30.660]   Yeah.
[01:15:30.660 --> 01:15:32.020]   No, at yeah.
[01:15:32.020 --> 01:15:33.820]   Yeah.
[01:15:33.820 --> 01:15:34.940]   That was OK.
[01:15:34.940 --> 01:15:37.260]   Yeah, that was a couple of days ago.
[01:15:37.260 --> 01:15:41.260]   I mean, they're going to have to work harder to get this to be more more up to
[01:15:41.260 --> 01:15:41.940]   date, I think.
[01:15:41.940 --> 01:15:45.700]   I like this use of the Getty image archive.
[01:15:45.700 --> 01:15:48.620]   Historic pictures.
[01:15:49.420 --> 01:15:50.860]   What do you think, Kevin?
[01:15:50.860 --> 01:15:53.780]   What is Twitter already existed already is what it is.
[01:15:53.780 --> 01:15:55.340]   It already does something as well and badly.
[01:15:55.340 --> 01:15:57.740]   What do you believe the essential value of Twitter is?
[01:15:57.740 --> 01:15:59.460]   How would you express that in a tweet?
[01:15:59.460 --> 01:16:04.020]   I've written essays about this.
[01:16:04.020 --> 01:16:05.220]   I'm sure it's an intuit.
[01:16:05.220 --> 01:16:06.380]   Yeah, I mean, that's all I know.
[01:16:06.380 --> 01:16:07.340]   It's hard for you, Kevin.
[01:16:07.340 --> 01:16:10.620]   I know it's very hard, but I know you can do it.
[01:16:10.620 --> 01:16:10.900]   Guy.
[01:16:10.900 --> 01:16:11.980]   I know you can.
[01:16:11.980 --> 01:16:14.820]   Well, so the essence of it for me is mutual media.
[01:16:14.820 --> 01:16:17.380]   The point is that we're each filtering the world for each other.
[01:16:17.860 --> 01:16:21.460]   And what we see through whom we follow is what makes sense to the world.
[01:16:21.460 --> 01:16:26.420]   That that's very much the core of Twitter as it has been for us.
[01:16:26.420 --> 01:16:28.220]   And you so you agree with Jeff really?
[01:16:28.220 --> 01:16:28.580]   Yeah.
[01:16:28.580 --> 01:16:30.900]   Yeah, no, and that's what you get.
[01:16:30.900 --> 01:16:36.820]   Is it is it that you somebody linked you to the best version of a given story
[01:16:36.820 --> 01:16:38.180]   about something that you're going to care about?
[01:16:38.180 --> 01:16:42.380]   Is it that you discovered a fact that you've got really quickly both?
[01:16:42.380 --> 01:16:44.540]   And the other days, why?
[01:16:44.540 --> 01:16:46.100]   Well, I had Twitter today because.
[01:16:46.740 --> 01:16:47.740]   Why do you finish that?
[01:16:47.740 --> 01:16:52.140]   And mostly because I had a conversation about something with somebody.
[01:16:52.140 --> 01:16:56.380]   Yeah, that's that that's actually the piece that, you know, that's hard as help.
[01:16:56.380 --> 01:16:57.100]   It draws you back in.
[01:16:57.100 --> 01:16:57.500]   It's hard to say.
[01:16:57.500 --> 01:17:01.180]   It's like this, you know, I got up this morning and swore about Google's AMP
[01:17:01.180 --> 01:17:05.620]   and the PM of it said, Oh, no, sorry, we've got to change something and fixed it.
[01:17:05.620 --> 01:17:08.860]   You know, that was that was my, my Twitter experience this morning.
[01:17:08.860 --> 01:17:09.380]   It was like.
[01:17:09.380 --> 01:17:10.660]   So here's another one.
[01:17:10.660 --> 01:17:13.340]   I was sitting there waiting for the kettle of oil and grumbling about
[01:17:13.340 --> 01:17:15.660]   Google's latest thing and they patch it in front of me.
[01:17:15.660 --> 01:17:18.540]   So that was my Twitter for today.
[01:17:18.540 --> 01:17:21.420]   So go to the celebrity world Instagram today released.
[01:17:21.420 --> 01:17:24.060]   I don't think it's on the rundown, but released it's yesterday today.
[01:17:24.060 --> 01:17:29.580]   It's top users and they're primarily celebrity women starting with guess who Taylor Swift.
[01:17:29.580 --> 01:17:31.700]   That's another way to do it.
[01:17:31.700 --> 01:17:34.540]   You know, here's the world through these people you might find interesting.
[01:17:34.540 --> 01:17:36.140]   And through them, you might find some other people interested in.
[01:17:36.140 --> 01:17:38.660]   So it's about people in that case.
[01:17:38.660 --> 01:17:41.580]   But it's about headlines.
[01:17:41.580 --> 01:17:43.340]   But that's what Twitter has done before.
[01:17:43.340 --> 01:17:45.340]   I mean, that Twitter already does that when you try and join up.
[01:17:45.340 --> 01:17:46.300]   It says exactly.
[01:17:46.300 --> 01:17:48.180]   Follow Lady Gaga for just in beep.
[01:17:48.180 --> 01:17:49.460]   But it's like, no, stop it.
[01:17:49.460 --> 01:17:52.860]   You know, if I log into Twitter with my with my other account,
[01:17:52.860 --> 01:17:56.260]   this doesn't follow any way, it'll give me like three pages of that nonsense as well.
[01:17:56.260 --> 01:18:00.340]   Then why don't you follow blah blah blah.
[01:18:00.340 --> 01:18:01.900]   I say, what should I do on this one?
[01:18:01.900 --> 01:18:04.460]   But it will it will give it does does that thing.
[01:18:04.460 --> 01:18:06.820]   The other thing that Twitter chip was highlights.
[01:18:06.820 --> 01:18:07.340]   Do you see that?
[01:18:07.340 --> 01:18:09.220]   Or is that is that only going to some people?
[01:18:12.460 --> 01:18:14.860]   Um, tell me about that.
[01:18:14.860 --> 01:18:15.740]   Where is that?
[01:18:15.740 --> 01:18:19.620]   Twitter show Twitter highlights.
[01:18:19.620 --> 01:18:21.540]   What does.
[01:18:21.540 --> 01:18:25.580]   So, OK, let me show you.
[01:18:25.580 --> 01:18:26.420]   Let me show you the highlights.
[01:18:26.420 --> 01:18:32.180]   Um, if you go to they will actually pop up as notifications, but if I go to high
[01:18:32.180 --> 01:18:33.660]   lights, yeah, yeah, there it is.
[01:18:33.660 --> 01:18:35.780]   Oh, actually, that's yes, I have.
[01:18:35.780 --> 01:18:38.020]   I'm getting that on my Android device as well now.
[01:18:38.020 --> 01:18:38.620]   Yeah.
[01:18:38.620 --> 01:18:39.100]   Yeah.
[01:18:39.100 --> 01:18:40.420]   OK, so that that's where I went out to.
[01:18:40.540 --> 01:18:42.060]   So that is more like clipboard.
[01:18:42.060 --> 01:18:42.860]   I'm getting to.
[01:18:42.860 --> 01:18:45.180]   Yeah, but it's in your notifications, which is weird.
[01:18:45.180 --> 01:18:47.060]   Well, but it is also in the menu.
[01:18:47.060 --> 01:18:49.460]   If you go to the top right and click it, there's a place to find it.
[01:18:49.460 --> 01:18:52.340]   But what this is is people you follow.
[01:18:52.340 --> 01:18:56.580]   Um, and it gives you a little reason at the top.
[01:18:56.580 --> 01:18:59.940]   It says two of these people follow this thing.
[01:18:59.940 --> 01:19:02.980]   Um, this is trending news in your area.
[01:19:02.980 --> 01:19:06.540]   Um, this requires that they know something about you that you have.
[01:19:06.540 --> 01:19:10.260]   Yes, this requires that you are logged in, but this is trying to give you.
[01:19:10.700 --> 01:19:16.340]   This is this is a parallel thing to the to the, you know, the other one is, um,
[01:19:16.340 --> 01:19:17.500]   here's the front page of the world.
[01:19:17.500 --> 01:19:18.380]   Here's what's going on.
[01:19:18.380 --> 01:19:19.780]   Where is this?
[01:19:19.780 --> 01:19:22.420]   Yeah, this seems to be with a new app.
[01:19:22.420 --> 01:19:23.980]   I've never seen it.
[01:19:23.980 --> 01:19:24.780]   I like this.
[01:19:24.780 --> 01:19:28.460]   So I it's obvious Twitter is casting around.
[01:19:28.460 --> 01:19:32.020]   It's trying to get, I mean, I'm empathetic with.
[01:19:32.020 --> 01:19:34.340]   What would you?
[01:19:34.340 --> 01:19:37.740]   I mean, so first of all, were you surprised that Jack Dorsey's the new CEO?
[01:19:39.780 --> 01:19:42.740]   Somebody mentioned there's going to be a lawsuit, but there'll be a shareholder
[01:19:42.740 --> 01:19:48.740]   lawsuit because the board said unequivocally we will not hire somebody who's
[01:19:48.740 --> 01:19:50.980]   going to be a CEO of two companies.
[01:19:50.980 --> 01:19:52.940]   Clearly pointed at Jack Dorsey.
[01:19:52.940 --> 01:19:55.340]   That kind of discussion when jobs was heading up to companies.
[01:19:55.340 --> 01:19:56.340]   What was the discussion?
[01:19:56.340 --> 01:20:00.700]   No, but that because it was really, he was never CEO of Pixar at the same time.
[01:20:00.700 --> 01:20:01.740]   He was chairman of the board.
[01:20:01.740 --> 01:20:02.900]   Oh, OK, right.
[01:20:02.900 --> 01:20:03.340]   It was running.
[01:20:03.340 --> 01:20:08.140]   But the point being that if the board makes a material statement about the future,
[01:20:08.140 --> 01:20:12.420]   like we will never hire somebody who's CEO of two companies and then does it.
[01:20:12.420 --> 01:20:17.900]   That's a that's a shareholder lawsuit because shareholders are investing
[01:20:17.900 --> 01:20:19.860]   based on material statements from the board.
[01:20:19.860 --> 01:20:25.260]   And for whatever, you know, I don't know if that went to me to start go up or down,
[01:20:25.260 --> 01:20:28.300]   but in any event, then you don't do it.
[01:20:28.300 --> 01:20:29.300]   That's a big deal.
[01:20:29.300 --> 01:20:30.180]   You can't do that.
[01:20:30.180 --> 01:20:33.460]   That was very undisciplined to the board.
[01:20:33.460 --> 01:20:37.900]   And some have speculated that it was really, I think it was Ben Thompson and
[01:20:37.900 --> 01:20:41.820]   Mr. Techery who speculated that really that was Ev Williams saying,
[01:20:41.820 --> 01:20:45.900]   saying under no circumstances, will I allow Jack Dorsey to come back?
[01:20:45.900 --> 01:20:47.140]   I want to be clear about this.
[01:20:47.140 --> 01:20:54.140]   Of course, Ev posted on Medium how wonderfully happy he is to have.
[01:20:54.140 --> 01:20:58.100]   But Ben says this is a somewhat of a lukewarm endorsement.
[01:20:58.100 --> 01:21:02.780]   Why I'm glad Jack is back at Twitter.
[01:21:06.140 --> 01:21:08.860]   So I don't know. There's a lot of stuff behind the scenes here.
[01:21:08.860 --> 01:21:10.260]   She posted on Medium on Twitter.
[01:21:10.260 --> 01:21:12.860]   Yeah, well, I'm sure he linked to it on Twitter.
[01:21:12.860 --> 01:21:17.540]   I don't know, Teddy.
[01:21:17.540 --> 01:21:21.460]   We can never run an A/B test and see what Twitter would have become had Jack State
[01:21:21.460 --> 01:21:24.860]   had I not fired Jack State in the role from 2008.
[01:21:24.860 --> 01:21:29.300]   Or if I stayed in the role for 2010, one good new one good thing for Jack is
[01:21:29.300 --> 01:21:31.900]   that Dick Costello is leaving the board.
[01:21:31.900 --> 01:21:35.580]   So he only has one of two previous CEOs looking at his shoulder.
[01:21:36.460 --> 01:21:41.940]   I boy, Jack, I don't, you know, what do you think?
[01:21:41.940 --> 01:21:43.620]   I don't know.
[01:21:43.620 --> 01:21:46.260]   I mean, didn't Jack have a chance before?
[01:21:46.260 --> 01:21:47.980]   Yeah. Yeah.
[01:21:47.980 --> 01:21:52.820]   We had a bad Adam Bain who's now COO was the, I know he's your favorite.
[01:21:52.820 --> 01:21:54.460]   Yeah. Well, people just like him a lot.
[01:21:54.460 --> 01:21:58.700]   I say I worked with him many, many, many years ago, really well thought of.
[01:21:58.700 --> 01:22:03.220]   He's a revenue guy. He's a business guy. He's saying he's, you know, this is,
[01:22:03.220 --> 01:22:06.420]   but part of what everyone too is, is does the company need the founder or not?
[01:22:06.420 --> 01:22:13.260]   Some, the shill in the chatroom saying, I think this is right, Twitter is being held
[01:22:13.260 --> 01:22:17.300]   to a big tech growth standard by the stock market that's totally unrealistic,
[01:22:17.300 --> 01:22:20.860]   not sustainable. But it's the way it is.
[01:22:20.860 --> 01:22:22.340]   You know, we've talked about this before.
[01:22:22.340 --> 01:22:26.500]   It's a shame that Twitter can't just beat Twitter as messy.
[01:22:26.500 --> 01:22:31.380]   One of the things a lot of people have said is now that Dick Costello is gone,
[01:22:31.380 --> 01:22:34.820]   Twitter should reach out to the developers, the third party developers that cost a
[01:22:34.820 --> 01:22:38.660]   low band throughout trashed and say, come back.
[01:22:38.660 --> 01:22:43.380]   We need to, I mentioned that they also just killed an API and I can't find it.
[01:22:43.380 --> 01:22:45.620]   Oh, yeah. They killed an API today.
[01:22:45.620 --> 01:22:47.740]   I mean, after Jack takes over.
[01:22:47.740 --> 01:22:52.980]   I find it.
[01:22:52.980 --> 01:22:54.740]   Chatroom. You may see that one.
[01:22:54.740 --> 01:22:58.580]   The reliable share count API.
[01:22:58.580 --> 01:23:00.180]   There it is. Thank you. Boy, you're good.
[01:23:00.660 --> 01:23:02.020]   Let Google, let Google works for you.
[01:23:02.020 --> 01:23:05.460]   What's the, what's the API?
[01:23:05.460 --> 01:23:11.620]   It's a public API, which makes it possible for plugin developers to, or just anybody
[01:23:11.620 --> 01:23:17.300]   who's coding in the context of a web page to see how often that page has been shared via Twitter.
[01:23:17.300 --> 01:23:22.420]   So I guess you can make a query to the API saying, hey, how many people are linking to me?
[01:23:22.420 --> 01:23:27.300]   This is an article from the stack.
[01:23:27.860 --> 01:23:30.820]   It's the end of a free ride after the shutdown of the ability to read back
[01:23:30.820 --> 01:23:32.340]   statistics from Jason endpoint.
[01:23:32.340 --> 01:23:36.420]   Those wanting to continue to display vanity metrics will need to either accept the limitations
[01:23:36.420 --> 01:23:39.620]   of the aggregate and non comprehensive rest API.
[01:23:39.620 --> 01:23:45.780]   In other words, not the fire hose or dig deep to begin to use more comprehensive statistics via
[01:23:45.780 --> 01:23:47.300]   Kneb, which has the fire hose.
[01:23:47.300 --> 01:23:56.020]   I don't know what this means, but this site says it's a bold monetizing move on the part of Twitter.
[01:23:56.500 --> 01:23:57.940]   So basically, I couldn't judge that.
[01:23:57.940 --> 01:24:02.660]   Okay, so it's not quite clear, but it sounds like it's, I mean, they want, you know,
[01:24:02.660 --> 01:24:06.500]   the irony is that the top of the page, it has like the little 70 tweet shares embedded in the page.
[01:24:06.500 --> 01:24:08.420]   Right. So you might have to his total shares. Yeah.
[01:24:08.420 --> 01:24:10.740]   So is that what the API was?
[01:24:10.740 --> 01:24:12.020]   I don't know.
[01:24:12.020 --> 01:24:15.860]   And let me actually read what Twitter said about it rather than the second order interpretation.
[01:24:15.860 --> 01:24:19.540]   Good thinking. A new design for tweet and follow buttons.
[01:24:19.540 --> 01:24:21.860]   This is a couple of the time contrast design.
[01:24:24.900 --> 01:24:27.620]   You know, I don't, this is actually from 15 days ago.
[01:24:27.620 --> 01:24:28.420]   I don't know if this is the,
[01:24:28.420 --> 01:24:29.460]   we've done any commercials yet.
[01:24:29.460 --> 01:24:30.820]   You want to do one?
[01:24:30.820 --> 01:24:31.220]   Just now.
[01:24:31.220 --> 01:24:31.860]   Do you need a break?
[01:24:31.860 --> 01:24:33.300]   You want to go to the bathroom?
[01:24:33.300 --> 01:24:35.300]   I'll talk about Linda dot com.
[01:24:35.300 --> 01:24:37.380]   Red dot.
[01:24:37.380 --> 01:24:39.700]   I'm more than just a bit.
[01:24:39.700 --> 01:24:43.540]   I snuck out during your Twitter debate.
[01:24:43.540 --> 01:24:47.060]   I got myself some nuts.
[01:24:47.060 --> 01:24:52.340]   This episode brought to you by Linda dot com, the online learning platform with over 3,000

[01:24:59.380 --> 01:25:00.580]   You can learn better web design.
[01:25:00.580 --> 01:25:01.620]   You can learn to code.
[01:25:01.620 --> 01:25:06.580]   They've got courses like analyzing your website to improve SEO.
[01:25:06.580 --> 01:25:08.420]   We need to do that big time.
[01:25:08.420 --> 01:25:10.100]   I might take that course tonight.
[01:25:10.100 --> 01:25:13.460]   Problem solving for web professionals, WordPress essential training.
[01:25:13.460 --> 01:25:15.700]   Up and running with Python and Django.
[01:25:15.700 --> 01:25:16.420]   And you know what?
[01:25:16.420 --> 01:25:18.340]   I guarantee you they're working on an amp.
[01:25:20.260 --> 01:25:22.260]   Of course, because that's what they do.
[01:25:22.260 --> 01:25:27.140]   They work closely with software developers too, so that they're ready when a new version
[01:25:27.140 --> 01:25:32.900]   of a program comes out with new video content taught by some of the best people in the business.
[01:25:32.900 --> 01:25:34.900]   Intermediate techniques for Squarespace seven.
[01:25:34.900 --> 01:25:35.620]   That's a course.
[01:25:35.620 --> 01:25:40.660]   Watch and learn from people who care passionately about what they're teaching and
[01:25:40.660 --> 01:25:42.580]   are working in the field.
[01:25:42.580 --> 01:25:44.020]   People like Bert Monroy.
[01:25:44.020 --> 01:25:47.700]   I mean, that's what you can't learn Photoshop from a better person than Bert Monroy.
[01:25:49.220 --> 01:25:50.340]   They're all look at that.
[01:25:50.340 --> 01:25:50.900]   What is that?
[01:25:50.900 --> 01:25:53.380]   Foundations of programming databases.
[01:25:53.380 --> 01:25:54.580]   Wow.
[01:25:54.580 --> 01:25:56.180]   Wow.
[01:25:56.180 --> 01:25:56.820]   That's deep.
[01:25:56.820 --> 01:25:58.580]   That's heavy voodoo there.
[01:25:58.580 --> 01:26:01.460]   But you can also learn how to program from the very ground up.
[01:26:01.460 --> 01:26:05.220]   In iOS and Android for Windows, it's just amazing.

[01:26:32.500 --> 01:26:33.220]   Great course.
[01:26:33.220 --> 01:26:37.140]   You'll by the end of it, you'll actually have a note taking app and you'll learn Swift.

[01:27:15.700 --> 01:27:18.020]   Oh, you got a unplugged plug-in, you're silonning.
[01:27:18.020 --> 01:27:19.780]   Me?
[01:27:19.780 --> 01:27:20.100]   Yeah.
[01:27:20.100 --> 01:27:22.900]   Sound like a robot.
[01:27:22.900 --> 01:27:27.220]   Well, true this is right.
[01:27:27.220 --> 01:27:27.220]   Well, true this one.
[01:27:27.220 --> 01:27:27.780]   Okay.
[01:27:27.780 --> 01:27:30.100]   Rah, rah, rah, rah, rah.
[01:27:30.100 --> 01:27:30.900]   Am I better?
[01:27:30.900 --> 01:27:31.140]   Yeah.
[01:27:31.140 --> 01:27:34.100]   This is the 40...
[01:27:34.100 --> 01:27:34.820]   I got the big one though.
[01:27:34.820 --> 01:27:35.140]   What is that?
[01:27:35.140 --> 01:27:36.100]   46 inches?
[01:27:36.100 --> 01:27:37.700]   'Cause you're a big guy.
[01:27:37.700 --> 01:27:41.140]   Well, also, I feel like the bigger the screen, the better with this stuff.
[01:27:41.140 --> 01:27:45.060]   I am really not convinced that smart watches are worth a dime.
[01:27:45.060 --> 01:27:47.540]   And I've worn them.
[01:27:47.540 --> 01:27:50.980]   I'm sure not buying another one until I see something that says it's
[01:27:50.980 --> 01:27:52.260]   more quickly better than this.
[01:27:52.260 --> 01:27:54.180]   So it's the same functionality, it's the same operation.
[01:27:54.180 --> 01:27:55.460]   Yeah, the Moto 360 is fine.
[01:27:55.460 --> 01:27:57.140]   The early one is fine.
[01:27:57.140 --> 01:27:59.460]   You know, what's different on this?
[01:27:59.460 --> 01:28:00.180]   It's basically the same.
[01:28:00.180 --> 01:28:04.420]   They have a better processor, but it's different bands and designs, that's all.
[01:28:04.420 --> 01:28:05.620]   And I think round is great.
[01:28:05.620 --> 01:28:06.340]   I really...
[01:28:06.340 --> 01:28:08.260]   This looks like I'm wearing a wristwatch, right?
[01:28:08.260 --> 01:28:10.340]   Here's the Huawei, which...
[01:28:10.340 --> 01:28:11.860]   Actually, well, that's the original 360.
[01:28:11.860 --> 01:28:13.300]   The original 360.
[01:28:13.300 --> 01:28:14.900]   So it's a little bit bigger.
[01:28:14.900 --> 01:28:18.020]   You're not wearing the Huawei, Jason, I'm surprised.
[01:28:18.020 --> 01:28:19.940]   The Huawei looks a lot like the 360.
[01:28:19.940 --> 01:28:24.900]   It's round, it's thick, it's ugly, and they all do the same kind of useless things.
[01:28:24.900 --> 01:28:26.660]   Here comes the Huawei.
[01:28:26.660 --> 01:28:28.020]   Jason's now running around.
[01:28:28.020 --> 01:28:31.460]   I'm going to have three watches before this day is done.
[01:28:31.460 --> 01:28:36.180]   And then the sport is coming sometime at some point.
[01:28:36.180 --> 01:28:38.420]   Oh, we got the box of the Huawei and the box.
[01:28:39.300 --> 01:28:40.420]   Let's see if I can...
[01:28:40.420 --> 01:28:41.300]   I don't know, I just...
[01:28:41.300 --> 01:28:43.380]   I feel like this whole category is just nothing.
[01:28:43.380 --> 01:28:44.020]   It's a flop.
[01:28:44.020 --> 01:28:45.700]   It reminds me of Google Glass.
[01:28:45.700 --> 01:28:47.220]   Doesn't that look exactly the same?
[01:28:47.220 --> 01:28:50.420]   It's got a leather band, but you can get a leather band on this.
[01:28:50.420 --> 01:28:51.540]   Oh, I watch this, that's the thing.
[01:28:51.540 --> 01:28:52.100]   Yeah.
[01:28:52.100 --> 01:28:52.340]   And...
[01:28:52.340 --> 01:28:54.420]   Well, they're...
[01:28:54.420 --> 01:28:56.980]   Or to use up a differentiation and making them out of gold and so on, so...
[01:28:56.980 --> 01:28:59.700]   Yeah, and Hermes bands and stuff.
[01:28:59.700 --> 01:29:03.220]   So anyway, I thought I'd mention that.
[01:29:03.220 --> 01:29:04.260]   Marshmallow is here.
[01:29:04.260 --> 01:29:06.180]   Are you excited?
[01:29:06.180 --> 01:29:07.540]   I have marshmallow.
[01:29:07.540 --> 01:29:08.580]   You do?
[01:29:08.580 --> 01:29:10.100]   No, not officially.
[01:29:10.100 --> 01:29:13.540]   I do because Jason Howell is the man.
[01:29:13.540 --> 01:29:15.620]   They talked about this last night on all about Android.
[01:29:15.620 --> 01:29:20.340]   He took a Nexus 7 and side loaded it with Marshall.
[01:29:20.340 --> 01:29:22.100]   Yeah, just flashed the image that they posted.
[01:29:22.100 --> 01:29:22.580]   But you're next...
[01:29:22.580 --> 01:29:24.260]   You have a Nexus 6, right, Jeff?
[01:29:24.260 --> 01:29:24.980]   That's what you're using.
[01:29:24.980 --> 01:29:26.180]   That'll get the updates in.
[01:29:26.180 --> 01:29:26.420]   Yeah.
[01:29:26.420 --> 01:29:28.020]   Oh, it'll still drop date.
[01:29:28.020 --> 01:29:28.980]   Check it up date.
[01:29:28.980 --> 01:29:29.620]   Check it up date.
[01:29:29.620 --> 01:29:30.180]   Check it up date.
[01:29:30.180 --> 01:29:30.660]   Check it up date.
[01:29:30.660 --> 01:29:31.060]   I know.
[01:29:31.060 --> 01:29:34.180]   I mean, this is a step up to the next version.
[01:29:34.180 --> 01:29:37.140]   So my thought was, why not start from scratch?
[01:29:37.780 --> 01:29:39.220]   So if I flash it,
[01:29:39.220 --> 01:29:40.820]   wiped it, started clean.
[01:29:40.820 --> 01:29:42.100]   That way I know for sure.
[01:29:42.100 --> 01:29:45.380]   I'm not carrying over any cruff.
[01:29:45.380 --> 01:29:48.500]   Let's do the now tap.
[01:29:48.500 --> 01:29:49.060]   What is it called?
[01:29:49.060 --> 01:29:49.700]   Now tap.
[01:29:49.700 --> 01:29:50.660]   Now on tap.
[01:29:50.660 --> 01:29:51.460]   Now on tap.
[01:29:51.460 --> 01:29:53.140]   I'm going to set and continue.
[01:29:53.140 --> 01:29:56.020]   So hello Leo and la demo.
[01:29:56.020 --> 01:29:58.980]   I love it.
[01:29:58.980 --> 01:30:01.860]   Let's go to G.CO.
[01:30:01.860 --> 01:30:04.500]   Oh, I have to do it in an app.
[01:30:04.500 --> 01:30:06.500]   You can do it in anything.
[01:30:06.500 --> 01:30:09.060]   I could do it in the crumbs and app, obviously.
[01:30:09.060 --> 01:30:09.620]   Absolutely.
[01:30:09.620 --> 01:30:10.260]   Yeah.
[01:30:10.260 --> 01:30:13.540]   Anything that has any text on it that I can grab.
[01:30:13.540 --> 01:30:15.860]   Contextually show you how fast amplodes.
[01:30:15.860 --> 01:30:19.940]   And then I search for Obama.
[01:30:19.940 --> 01:30:23.140]   Dot net framework.
[01:30:23.140 --> 01:30:23.940]   You could talk to it.
[01:30:23.940 --> 01:30:26.420]   Oh, you're so fancy.
[01:30:26.420 --> 01:30:28.820]   We don't talk to device.
[01:30:28.820 --> 01:30:31.220]   Talking better on marshmallow oil.
[01:30:31.220 --> 01:30:31.540]   I don't think so.
[01:30:31.540 --> 01:30:32.580]   Now.
[01:30:32.580 --> 01:30:35.300]   So, Obama apologizes to everybody.
[01:30:35.300 --> 01:30:35.860]   It looks like.
[01:30:35.860 --> 01:30:38.820]   So the amp didn't show up there.
[01:30:38.820 --> 01:30:39.140]   No.
[01:30:39.140 --> 01:30:41.380]   Interesting, huh?
[01:30:41.380 --> 01:30:43.540]   So I just tap what I press.
[01:30:43.540 --> 01:30:46.740]   So your home button just press and hold it.
[01:30:46.740 --> 01:30:47.940]   Press and hold the home button.
[01:30:47.940 --> 01:30:49.060]   And it'll go boop.
[01:30:49.060 --> 01:30:50.500]   Google now on tap.
[01:30:50.500 --> 01:30:51.540]   And you can let go now.
[01:30:51.540 --> 01:30:53.140]   And it'll analyze and give you
[01:30:53.140 --> 01:30:55.220]   car related stuff.
[01:30:55.220 --> 01:30:57.300]   That are related to the stuff that finds on the page.
[01:30:57.300 --> 01:30:57.620]   That.
[01:30:57.620 --> 01:30:58.580]   Yeah.
[01:30:58.580 --> 01:31:00.740]   And it will do this with apps if apps support it.
[01:31:00.740 --> 01:31:02.580]   The app has to specifically support it.
[01:31:04.100 --> 01:31:05.780]   So I looked up Hillary Clinton.
[01:31:05.780 --> 01:31:07.700]   It says maybe you'd be interested in Bernie Sanders.
[01:31:07.700 --> 01:31:12.180]   They're trying to influence the election.
[01:31:12.180 --> 01:31:12.660]   That is.
[01:31:12.660 --> 01:31:12.660]   See.
[01:31:12.660 --> 01:31:14.020]   You see.
[01:31:14.020 --> 01:31:15.940]   What else is new Jason?
[01:31:15.940 --> 01:31:16.420]   Let's see.
[01:31:16.420 --> 01:31:19.060]   This looks very similar.
[01:31:19.060 --> 01:31:24.340]   I understand that they have a simpler system of notifications.
[01:31:24.340 --> 01:31:25.540]   Oh yeah, that's a lot.
[01:31:25.540 --> 01:31:30.420]   They'd I kind of like the priority thing with.
[01:31:30.420 --> 01:31:31.460]   It's funny.
[01:31:31.460 --> 01:31:34.420]   I was actually just reading on that a little bit earlier.
[01:31:34.420 --> 01:31:39.220]   So what you get now is the hold down volume all the way down
[01:31:39.220 --> 01:31:40.980]   and it'll go to complete silence eventually,
[01:31:40.980 --> 01:31:42.420]   which you didn't have in Lollipop.
[01:31:42.420 --> 01:31:43.860]   You know, different steps, right?
[01:31:43.860 --> 01:31:44.660]   So you get that.
[01:31:44.660 --> 01:31:44.900]   Great.
[01:31:44.900 --> 01:31:46.260]   And now I can do this.
[01:31:46.260 --> 01:31:50.180]   If you still want to do do not disturb slash priority mode,
[01:31:50.180 --> 01:31:53.860]   which by the way, you can set up multiple different aspects to that.
[01:31:53.860 --> 01:31:57.860]   So like week nights versus weekends versus all this kind of stuff.
[01:31:57.860 --> 01:32:00.420]   You have to go into your your settings pull down.
[01:32:01.380 --> 01:32:04.820]   So go do the double double finger swipe down from the top.
[01:32:04.820 --> 01:32:06.420]   That'll give you your settings pull down.
[01:32:06.420 --> 01:32:06.660]   Yeah.
[01:32:06.660 --> 01:32:08.820]   And then there's a little do not disturb there.
[01:32:08.820 --> 01:32:10.660]   I'll tap that and then that'll bring you through.
[01:32:10.660 --> 01:32:12.100]   Oh, and then it's kind of the same thing,
[01:32:12.100 --> 01:32:13.300]   but it's in a different spot.
[01:32:13.300 --> 01:32:14.580]   It just takes a little bit more to get to.
[01:32:14.580 --> 01:32:18.420]   So if that's the thing you really like, it requires a little more effort.
[01:32:18.420 --> 01:32:20.580]   But I think this they wanted to give you more information
[01:32:20.580 --> 01:32:21.940]   about what the do not disturb was.
[01:32:21.940 --> 01:32:24.660]   Yeah, there was a lot of confusion around around that.
[01:32:24.660 --> 01:32:27.380]   And then here's the here's the setting.
[01:32:27.380 --> 01:32:28.740]   This looks very similar, doesn't it?
[01:32:29.300 --> 01:32:30.260]   Oh, yeah.
[01:32:30.260 --> 01:32:34.740]   From from a visual standpoint, it's very similar to a polypomp.
[01:32:34.740 --> 01:32:37.460]   You know, some of the bigger things that you're going to see
[01:32:37.460 --> 01:32:39.060]   are going to happen behind the scenes.
[01:32:39.060 --> 01:32:42.100]   Doze in particular, which is.
[01:32:42.100 --> 01:32:44.660]   Yeah, it's too early to know if we're getting better battery life, I presume.
[01:32:44.660 --> 01:32:48.740]   I mean, I've noticed pretty consistently on my Nexus 6,
[01:32:48.740 --> 01:32:50.660]   I've been running the developer previews, you know,
[01:32:50.660 --> 01:32:52.100]   since they've been doing them.
[01:32:52.100 --> 01:32:55.540]   And I absolutely noticed a big difference with does if you're working.
[01:32:56.420 --> 01:33:00.580]   If you're working, you set your device down or you leave it unplugged overnight,
[01:33:00.580 --> 01:33:04.740]   the battery loss is significantly lower than it was before Marshmallow.
[01:33:04.740 --> 01:33:06.340]   It's flappy.
[01:33:06.340 --> 01:33:08.020]   Yeah, they did change it.
[01:33:08.020 --> 01:33:09.620]   It can be multiplayer, by the way.
[01:33:09.620 --> 01:33:12.820]   So when you first fire it up, it'll have the number up at the top
[01:33:12.820 --> 01:33:14.020]   and you can increase players.
[01:33:14.020 --> 01:33:17.220]   So if you have a large tablet, all of you can gather around the tablet
[01:33:17.220 --> 01:33:19.620]   and play this impossible game.
[01:33:19.620 --> 01:33:20.820]   I hate this game so much.
[01:33:20.820 --> 01:33:21.620]   Yeah, it's pretty bad.
[01:33:21.620 --> 01:33:22.900]   Okay.
[01:33:22.900 --> 01:33:25.220]   So you're flying through Marshmallow.
[01:33:26.100 --> 01:33:30.180]   Yeah, every time I get stuck on Marshmallows.
[01:33:30.180 --> 01:33:32.180]   So there you have it.
[01:33:32.180 --> 01:33:36.740]   It really could have been 5.2, I guess.
[01:33:36.740 --> 01:33:39.300]   Maybe there's a lot more inside.
[01:33:39.300 --> 01:33:44.180]   There's actually some security stuff that is probably significant.
[01:33:44.180 --> 01:33:46.100]   But although, guess what?
[01:33:46.100 --> 01:33:50.500]   Stage fright is back and it still affects Marshmallow.
[01:33:50.500 --> 01:33:51.700]   No.
[01:33:51.700 --> 01:33:57.460]   Oh, it's a new one though. You have to have a download or play a malformed
[01:33:57.460 --> 01:34:01.700]   MP3 file or MP4 file.
[01:34:01.700 --> 01:34:05.540]   Actually, this is Imperium discovered it again,
[01:34:05.540 --> 01:34:08.500]   but they don't have yet stage fright detector.
[01:34:08.500 --> 01:34:10.980]   I don't think for the new one, let me just download and install this and see.
[01:34:10.980 --> 01:34:14.340]   I think this stage fright detector, which is the one we recommend.
[01:34:14.340 --> 01:34:16.260]   What?
[01:34:16.260 --> 01:34:18.100]   I don't want that.
[01:34:18.100 --> 01:34:19.940]   I want this.
[01:34:20.900 --> 01:34:21.780]   That's weird.
[01:34:21.780 --> 01:34:23.700]   But in analysis, oh, I just tapped the wrong one.
[01:34:23.700 --> 01:34:24.180]   Oh, okay.
[01:34:24.180 --> 01:34:26.180]   Trying to trick you into these.
[01:34:26.180 --> 01:34:28.820]   Yes, see, this is all the old stage fright.
[01:34:28.820 --> 01:34:30.740]   So at least Marshmallow is safe from that.
[01:34:30.740 --> 01:34:34.660]   You don't have to turn off MMS reception on Hangouts.
[01:34:34.660 --> 01:34:39.300]   But there's a new one and you have to be a little bit careful about one MP3s and MP4s.
[01:34:39.300 --> 01:34:46.740]   Even preview will infect you if it's a malcrafted MP3 MP4.
[01:34:46.740 --> 01:34:50.020]   Kind of a big issue, I think, for Google.
[01:34:50.020 --> 01:34:52.020]   Yeah, almost a billion Android hosts.
[01:34:52.020 --> 01:34:55.380]   It's a persistent issue until they address it underneath.
[01:34:55.380 --> 01:34:57.460]   You know, maybe with the next version of Android,
[01:34:57.460 --> 01:35:05.220]   they kind of move away from the stage fright way of handling media at its core and do something different.
[01:35:05.220 --> 01:35:08.820]   Or hey, they should improve the way that they roll out updates.
[01:35:08.820 --> 01:35:12.100]   So everybody gets them regardless of anyone else's interruption.
[01:35:12.100 --> 01:35:14.180]   So that's an idea.
[01:35:14.180 --> 01:35:16.900]   Now on tap, it doesn't require cooperation of the app.
[01:35:16.900 --> 01:35:18.500]   So I can press and hold the home button.
[01:35:19.060 --> 01:35:21.620]   And it'll analyze pretty much anything.
[01:35:21.620 --> 01:35:26.900]   So if I wanted to know more about stage fright, it's kind of a scant amount of data.
[01:35:26.900 --> 01:35:35.300]   I will say one thing that I'm really liking is how Marshmallow is handling permissions,
[01:35:35.300 --> 01:35:37.380]   just app permissions.
[01:35:37.380 --> 01:35:43.460]   So launching an app for the first time, it wants to access the camera.
[01:35:43.460 --> 01:35:47.620]   It'll pop up a little nice looking little toast message that says,
[01:35:47.620 --> 01:35:49.220]   do you want to grant access to the camera?
[01:35:49.220 --> 01:35:52.660]   And then from that point on, the app has access to the camera.
[01:35:52.660 --> 01:35:53.620]   And it's more granular.
[01:35:53.620 --> 01:35:55.380]   You can say no, and the app will still work.
[01:35:55.380 --> 01:35:56.340]   Let's just--
[01:35:56.340 --> 01:35:59.540]   And hopefully the developers have worked in a way to make that, you know,
[01:35:59.540 --> 01:36:03.540]   Marshmallow ready so that it kind of degrades gracefully.
[01:36:03.540 --> 01:36:08.020]   I've never seen quite a long-- quite a so long a list of things Facebook needs to access.
[01:36:08.020 --> 01:36:08.900]   Welcome to Facebook.
[01:36:08.900 --> 01:36:11.540]   It wants everything.
[01:36:11.540 --> 01:36:12.260]   It wants everything.
[01:36:12.260 --> 01:36:12.660]   Yeah.
[01:36:12.660 --> 01:36:16.340]   So even though it asked for, and I gave it permission to do all those things,
[01:36:16.340 --> 01:36:20.100]   it's still going to ask some explicit permissions as the app happens.
[01:36:20.100 --> 01:36:22.580]   That's what, of course, iOS doesn't that sense?
[01:36:22.580 --> 01:36:23.060]   Yeah.
[01:36:23.060 --> 01:36:26.500]   It's the way that, in my opinion, the way that it should have been all along.
[01:36:26.500 --> 01:36:27.780]   I think it makes the most sense.
[01:36:27.780 --> 01:36:30.580]   Okay.
[01:36:30.580 --> 01:36:32.100]   Marshmallow.
[01:36:32.100 --> 01:36:34.820]   Moto 360 still waiting for my five--
[01:36:34.820 --> 01:36:38.420]   I think I'm going to get the 6P, not the 5X.
[01:36:38.420 --> 01:36:39.940]   I'm going to get this go for the 6P.
[01:36:39.940 --> 01:36:42.420]   Jeff, did you decide what you want to do on that?
[01:36:42.420 --> 01:36:44.180]   Well, I already ordered.
[01:36:44.180 --> 01:36:45.300]   I ordered the P.
[01:36:45.300 --> 01:36:45.780]   Yeah.
[01:36:46.660 --> 01:36:47.140]   Oh, yeah.
[01:36:47.140 --> 01:36:52.900]   So if I get the Pixel C,
[01:36:52.900 --> 01:36:58.660]   I'm now thinking I should have gotten a 128 gig.
[01:36:58.660 --> 01:36:59.220]   No.
[01:36:59.220 --> 01:36:59.220]   For--
[01:36:59.220 --> 01:36:59.700]   No.
[01:36:59.700 --> 01:37:05.620]   Because-- because I use my Nexus 7 to watch movies and shows on planes and stuff.
[01:37:05.620 --> 01:37:12.740]   If I use my Nexus 6P, then I might want more space for it, but it's too late.
[01:37:12.740 --> 01:37:13.380]   I've already ordered it.
[01:37:13.380 --> 01:37:14.340]   That's fine.
[01:37:14.340 --> 01:37:15.300]   I think 64.
[01:37:15.300 --> 01:37:16.500]   You probably got 64, right?
[01:37:16.500 --> 01:37:17.380]   I think that's fine.
[01:37:17.380 --> 01:37:17.860]   I did.
[01:37:17.860 --> 01:37:20.100]   I mean, how-- a movie's a gigabyte.
[01:37:20.100 --> 01:37:22.260]   How many movies do you need?
[01:37:22.260 --> 01:37:25.940]   I fill this wall because I have like, like, you know, five episodes of Good Wife.
[01:37:25.940 --> 01:37:29.620]   I have four of humans and I have three of Banshee.
[01:37:29.620 --> 01:37:30.580]   I like them a lot more of that.
[01:37:30.580 --> 01:37:31.620]   Is that what a little variety?
[01:37:31.620 --> 01:37:36.020]   You know, you know, I've gone in weird places and, you know, watch-- watch shows.
[01:37:36.020 --> 01:37:38.420]   If you weren't scared of Google, maybe you will be now.
[01:37:38.420 --> 01:37:41.620]   They're working on a general purpose robot.
[01:37:41.620 --> 01:37:44.740]   And according to Bloomberg Biggest Business, they are
[01:37:44.740 --> 01:37:48.100]   making strides, so to speak.
[01:37:48.100 --> 01:37:50.900]   Great strides.
[01:37:50.900 --> 01:37:54.340]   Humans, the show, comes to life.
[01:37:54.340 --> 01:38:00.260]   I wouldn't mind having an Android, a human-like helper.
[01:38:00.260 --> 01:38:03.620]   I just don't want that nurse that-- what's his name, has?
[01:38:03.620 --> 01:38:05.460]   She's harsh.
[01:38:05.460 --> 01:38:06.660]   Yes.
[01:38:06.660 --> 01:38:07.700]   Yes, but at least she doesn't--
[01:38:07.700 --> 01:38:08.820]   I do so many bad things.
[01:38:08.820 --> 01:38:11.300]   You must eat your broth.
[01:38:11.300 --> 01:38:12.500]   She took away his sandwich.
[01:38:13.060 --> 01:38:14.580]   He made himself a nice grilled cheese.
[01:38:14.580 --> 01:38:15.140]   He said, "Nope."
[01:38:15.140 --> 01:38:19.860]   But at least she doesn't leak blue fluid out of her nose, like that old one.
[01:38:19.860 --> 01:38:23.300]   That'll ruin your day.
[01:38:23.300 --> 01:38:25.220]   All right.
[01:38:25.220 --> 01:38:26.580]   What are their stories here?
[01:38:26.580 --> 01:38:28.420]   "Google and Israel are going to the moon."
[01:38:28.420 --> 01:38:30.340]   That'll be a big deal to contest.
[01:38:30.340 --> 01:38:31.140]   That's really--
[01:38:31.140 --> 01:38:31.940]   Okay.
[01:38:31.940 --> 01:38:32.980]   I don't think it's--
[01:38:32.980 --> 01:38:36.740]   Alphabet's new motto or if I don't know what it is--
[01:38:36.740 --> 01:38:37.780]   It's not "Don't Be Evil."
[01:38:37.780 --> 01:38:39.940]   It's "Go Do Something Nice to Somebody."
[01:38:39.940 --> 01:38:41.300]   No, it's--
[01:38:42.100 --> 01:38:42.740]   But it's "Hug--
[01:38:42.740 --> 01:38:45.220]   Hug a German today."
[01:38:45.220 --> 01:38:46.180]   Hug a German today.
[01:38:46.180 --> 01:38:46.740]   Hug a German today.
[01:38:46.740 --> 01:38:47.540]   Do the right thing.
[01:38:47.540 --> 01:38:49.380]   It's Spike Lee.
[01:38:49.380 --> 01:38:50.820]   As of last Friday.
[01:38:50.820 --> 01:38:51.380]   It's Spike Lee.
[01:38:51.380 --> 01:38:51.940]   That's right.
[01:38:51.940 --> 01:38:52.900]   It's a Spike Lee joint.
[01:38:52.900 --> 01:38:55.860]   As of last Friday, it's all done.
[01:38:55.860 --> 01:38:58.980]   Alphabet, the holding company, has been formed.
[01:38:58.980 --> 01:39:02.100]   If you had shares of the Google Stock,
[01:39:02.100 --> 01:39:04.100]   you've been converted to your Alphabet shares.
[01:39:04.100 --> 01:39:07.860]   Tickers, our goog--
[01:39:07.860 --> 01:39:08.980]   for goog is the same.
[01:39:09.860 --> 01:39:10.980]   The board is the same.
[01:39:10.980 --> 01:39:12.100]   Shareholder writes are the same,
[01:39:12.100 --> 01:39:13.460]   and you still don't get to vote.
[01:39:13.460 --> 01:39:16.660]   Because that's Larry and Sergey's job.
[01:39:16.660 --> 01:39:18.180]   And they--
[01:39:18.180 --> 01:39:19.220]   Yeah, there's a new motto.
[01:39:19.220 --> 01:39:21.860]   Where is the code of conduct?
[01:39:21.860 --> 01:39:22.820]   Let me see if I can find that.
[01:39:22.820 --> 01:39:24.020]   Here it is.
[01:39:24.020 --> 01:39:26.020]   This is from the Verge.
[01:39:26.020 --> 01:39:30.020]   They have a little scan of the code of conduct,
[01:39:30.020 --> 01:39:30.500]   I think, here.
[01:39:30.500 --> 01:39:30.980]   Maybe not.
[01:39:30.980 --> 01:39:34.420]   Instead of "Don't Be Evil,"
[01:39:34.420 --> 01:39:35.700]   Oh, here it is.
[01:39:35.700 --> 01:39:36.580]   Top link, yeah.
[01:39:36.580 --> 01:39:37.460]   It is--
[01:39:39.460 --> 01:39:40.660]   Avoid conflicts of interest.
[01:39:40.660 --> 01:39:41.300]   No.
[01:39:41.300 --> 01:39:43.140]   It should do the right thing.
[01:39:43.140 --> 01:39:44.340]   Follow the law.
[01:39:44.340 --> 01:39:45.540]   Act honorably.
[01:39:45.540 --> 01:39:47.300]   And treat each other with respect.
[01:39:47.300 --> 01:39:52.260]   Sounds like a Boy Scouts motto.
[01:39:52.260 --> 01:39:55.380]   It's going to be harder and harder to obey the law
[01:39:55.380 --> 01:39:56.580]   if the U keeps this up.
[01:39:56.580 --> 01:39:59.220]   Oh, man.
[01:39:59.220 --> 01:39:59.780]   Which law?
[01:39:59.780 --> 01:40:00.260]   Which law?
[01:40:00.260 --> 01:40:00.820]   Whose law?
[01:40:00.820 --> 01:40:01.780]   Yes.
[01:40:01.780 --> 01:40:04.980]   Yeah, believe me.
[01:40:04.980 --> 01:40:08.340]   Who was sad about that?
[01:40:08.340 --> 01:40:08.660]   Yeah.
[01:40:08.660 --> 01:40:08.980]   Yeah.
[01:40:09.860 --> 01:40:09.860]   Yeah.
[01:40:09.860 --> 01:40:12.740]   By the way, a motor roll,
[01:40:12.740 --> 01:40:14.180]   I was a little disappointed on the Moto X.
[01:40:14.180 --> 01:40:16.820]   I'm now glad that I didn't stick with the Moto X.
[01:40:16.820 --> 01:40:19.460]   Has decided that when they do the marshmallow upgrade,
[01:40:19.460 --> 01:40:21.540]   they're going to take out all the things
[01:40:21.540 --> 01:40:23.860]   that Moto made the Moto X so great.
[01:40:23.860 --> 01:40:24.420]   Assist.
[01:40:24.420 --> 01:40:25.780]   You're kidding me.
[01:40:25.780 --> 01:40:27.380]   They're going to take out all the enhancements.
[01:40:27.380 --> 01:40:28.740]   They say, "Oh, we don't need to do it anymore,"
[01:40:28.740 --> 01:40:31.300]   because marshmallow does it all so well.
[01:40:31.300 --> 01:40:32.420]   I don't think so.
[01:40:32.420 --> 01:40:35.380]   What a roll is kind of backsliding a little bit right now.
[01:40:35.380 --> 01:40:36.420]   This is what everybody's saying.
[01:40:36.420 --> 01:40:40.820]   Also, they announced their update schedule for marshmallow
[01:40:40.820 --> 01:40:44.180]   and of all the devices that they are updating.
[01:40:44.180 --> 01:40:46.340]   They are not updating this year's Moto E.
[01:40:46.340 --> 01:40:50.100]   This year's Moto E is not updating to marshmallow.
[01:40:50.100 --> 01:40:51.220]   It's not included on the list.
[01:40:51.220 --> 01:40:53.220]   Do you think they know something about performance?
[01:40:53.220 --> 01:40:53.860]   Man, that's--
[01:40:53.860 --> 01:40:55.380]   It's not the point of Moto E.
[01:40:55.380 --> 01:40:57.540]   The Moto E is supposed to be like two years ago's
[01:40:57.540 --> 01:40:58.340]   modal size, which--
[01:40:58.340 --> 01:41:00.420]   Yeah.
[01:41:00.420 --> 01:41:02.980]   They posted on their site a few months ago,
[01:41:02.980 --> 01:41:05.060]   man, I have to pull up the all about Android doc
[01:41:05.060 --> 01:41:06.660]   to find it.
[01:41:06.660 --> 01:41:09.540]   They posted something about never having to worry.
[01:41:09.540 --> 01:41:11.380]   Like, this is going to be updated.
[01:41:11.380 --> 01:41:12.500]   La, blah, blah.
[01:41:12.500 --> 01:41:12.980]   We do.
[01:41:12.980 --> 01:41:14.980]   I'll define the exact--
[01:41:14.980 --> 01:41:17.060]   Do you still have your Mattel Viewmaster here?
[01:41:17.060 --> 01:41:19.060]   We got the new Viewmaster.
[01:41:19.060 --> 01:41:20.900]   You got the new one?
[01:41:20.900 --> 01:41:21.380]   You got it already?
[01:41:21.380 --> 01:41:21.700]   The new one?
[01:41:21.700 --> 01:41:22.740]   I was going to go to the store tonight.
[01:41:22.740 --> 01:41:23.460]   Yeah.
[01:41:23.460 --> 01:41:24.420]   It's at stores now.
[01:41:24.420 --> 01:41:24.500]   It's at the store's now.
[01:41:24.500 --> 01:41:25.060]   It's bought up.
[01:41:25.060 --> 01:41:26.180]   Nice.
[01:41:26.180 --> 01:41:27.300]   Is it just the cardboard?
[01:41:27.300 --> 01:41:28.420]   It's a cardboard.
[01:41:28.420 --> 01:41:28.900]   It's cheap.
[01:41:28.900 --> 01:41:29.620]   29 bucks.
[01:41:29.620 --> 01:41:31.780]   And thank you, Jason.
[01:41:31.780 --> 01:41:33.940]   Jason loves VR.
[01:41:34.660 --> 01:41:36.340]   Comes from a little AR thing too.
[01:41:36.340 --> 01:41:38.180]   Yeah, it does.
[01:41:38.180 --> 01:41:39.940]   So it's kind of cool looking.
[01:41:39.940 --> 01:41:41.460]   I could see kids being into this.
[01:41:41.460 --> 01:41:44.100]   You have to hold it, of course,
[01:41:44.100 --> 01:41:45.700]   because it's a Viewmaster.
[01:41:45.700 --> 01:41:47.700]   And then what do you do, Jason?
[01:41:47.700 --> 01:41:48.820]   You show it the disc.
[01:41:48.820 --> 01:41:49.860]   Take a picture of the disc.
[01:41:49.860 --> 01:41:50.420]   Yeah.
[01:41:50.420 --> 01:41:50.980]   Yeah.
[01:41:50.980 --> 01:41:51.780]   So here's a--
[01:41:51.780 --> 01:41:53.700]   This is very strange.
[01:41:53.700 --> 01:41:55.620]   You would expect it to somehow--
[01:41:55.620 --> 01:41:57.620]   Remember Viewmasters, they have these little--
[01:41:57.620 --> 01:41:58.420]   Yeah.
[01:41:58.420 --> 01:41:58.420]   Yeah.
[01:41:58.420 --> 01:41:59.620]   This is like you stick in the top.
[01:41:59.620 --> 01:42:00.020]   Yeah.
[01:42:00.020 --> 01:42:00.900]   Yeah, but no, no.
[01:42:00.900 --> 01:42:01.460]   Not anymore.
[01:42:01.460 --> 01:42:02.660]   Now you just look at it.
[01:42:02.660 --> 01:42:03.220]   What do you do?
[01:42:03.220 --> 01:42:03.780]   Yeah.
[01:42:03.780 --> 01:42:04.660]   You just look at it?
[01:42:04.660 --> 01:42:06.580]   Wow.
[01:42:06.580 --> 01:42:09.700]   Oh, I got to put my phone in here.
[01:42:09.700 --> 01:42:10.260]   Yeah.
[01:42:10.260 --> 01:42:12.260]   Oh, he's not standing alone.
[01:42:12.260 --> 01:42:12.740]   Oh.
[01:42:12.740 --> 01:42:14.260]   Oh.
[01:42:14.260 --> 01:42:19.540]   So maybe Jason had one loaded in there when he had it.
[01:42:19.540 --> 01:42:20.660]   Oh, I see.
[01:42:20.660 --> 01:42:23.780]   So it's a cardboard without the actual straps.
[01:42:23.780 --> 01:42:24.340]   Yeah.
[01:42:24.340 --> 01:42:24.580]   Yeah.
[01:42:24.580 --> 01:42:26.660]   Well, the cardboard didn't have straps either, right?
[01:42:26.660 --> 01:42:28.100]   So will it fit any size phone?
[01:42:28.100 --> 01:42:28.580]   Yeah.
[01:42:28.580 --> 01:42:29.060]   Yeah.
[01:42:29.060 --> 01:42:29.140]   Oh, the next--
[01:42:29.140 --> 01:42:30.260]   Oh, the carbon had no straps.
[01:42:30.260 --> 01:42:31.380]   Well, where do I put it?
[01:42:31.380 --> 01:42:31.940]   Oh, in here.
[01:42:31.940 --> 01:42:32.500]   Yeah.
[01:42:32.500 --> 01:42:33.220]   Oh, that-- OK.
[01:42:33.220 --> 01:42:33.860]   So this is good.
[01:42:33.860 --> 01:42:35.060]   It has kind of some--
[01:42:35.060 --> 01:42:35.380]   OK.
[01:42:35.380 --> 01:42:38.180]   Some sort of mechanism to hold.
[01:42:38.180 --> 01:42:38.900]   You know, let's see.
[01:42:38.900 --> 01:42:40.020]   This is the biggest phone you'd ever
[01:42:40.020 --> 01:42:41.380]   try to get in here, right?
[01:42:41.380 --> 01:42:41.540]   Yeah.
[01:42:41.540 --> 01:42:41.540]   Yeah.
[01:42:41.540 --> 01:42:42.980]   Ah.
[01:42:42.980 --> 01:42:44.260]   I don't know if it's going to fit the six.
[01:42:44.260 --> 01:42:45.380]   Do you want to fit the big one?
[01:42:45.380 --> 01:42:46.580]   You might not fit the six.
[01:42:46.580 --> 01:42:47.700]   But X is six.
[01:42:47.700 --> 01:42:48.820]   It said the six is hard to get in.
[01:42:48.820 --> 01:42:49.620]   You get a little casing.
[01:42:49.620 --> 01:42:50.260]   Oh, yeah, you get in.
[01:42:50.260 --> 01:42:50.740]   There you go.
[01:42:50.740 --> 01:42:51.780]   There you go.
[01:42:51.780 --> 01:42:52.260]   There you go.
[01:42:52.260 --> 01:42:53.300]   Do I have to do anything?
[01:42:53.300 --> 01:42:54.900]   We get to download it in an app.
[01:42:54.900 --> 01:42:56.180]   Oh, I have to have an app on here.
[01:42:56.180 --> 01:42:56.820]   My God.
[01:42:56.820 --> 01:42:57.780]   Is it the card?
[01:42:57.780 --> 01:42:58.900]   Is it the cardboard app?
[01:42:58.900 --> 01:42:59.700]   Or--
[01:42:59.700 --> 01:43:01.780]   You have a little QR code here, I could probably.
[01:43:01.780 --> 01:43:03.460]   Oh, the Mattelzone.
[01:43:03.460 --> 01:43:04.100]   VR app.
[01:43:04.100 --> 01:43:06.260]   Search for Mattel.
[01:43:06.260 --> 01:43:07.940]   All right.
[01:43:07.940 --> 01:43:08.900]   No, no, no.
[01:43:08.900 --> 01:43:09.900]   Look.
[01:43:09.900 --> 01:43:14.980]   What's the point if we don't do it all from scratch, right?
[01:43:14.980 --> 01:43:16.260]   Yeah, that wouldn't say where I
[01:43:16.260 --> 01:43:19.620]   would try to get you to run for stuff either.
[01:43:19.620 --> 01:43:20.820]   You're after all a how-to show.
[01:43:20.820 --> 01:43:21.860]   Ever after high?
[01:43:21.860 --> 01:43:23.060]   Stop motion movie creator.
[01:43:23.060 --> 01:43:23.860]   Barbie life.
[01:43:23.860 --> 01:43:24.820]   Monster high?
[01:43:24.820 --> 01:43:26.660]   Oh, the Monster High game is so good.
[01:43:26.660 --> 01:43:27.220]   What?
[01:43:27.220 --> 01:43:28.340]   Just kidding.
[01:43:28.340 --> 01:43:30.500]   View master wildlife?
[01:43:30.500 --> 01:43:30.980]   Yeah.
[01:43:30.980 --> 01:43:31.940]   So any one of these?
[01:43:31.940 --> 01:43:32.900]   Anyone of those three.
[01:43:32.900 --> 01:43:33.380]   OK.
[01:43:33.380 --> 01:43:34.380]   OK.
[01:43:34.380 --> 01:43:34.900]   All right.
[01:43:34.900 --> 01:43:35.700]   Install view master.
[01:43:35.700 --> 01:43:36.980]   Maybe I need to get this for--
[01:43:36.980 --> 01:43:37.620]   I'm not sure.
[01:43:37.620 --> 01:43:38.660]   I think the kids would love this.
[01:43:38.660 --> 01:43:41.220]   In app purchases, proceed.
[01:43:41.220 --> 01:43:43.460]   I don't care if it's--
[01:43:43.460 --> 01:43:45.060]   I think I'm on wifi anyway.
[01:43:45.060 --> 01:43:48.020]   Why they ask you that if you're on wifi?
[01:43:48.020 --> 01:43:49.780]   They should just say, OK.
[01:43:49.780 --> 01:43:53.940]   So this is 279 megabytes of animal pictures.
[01:43:53.940 --> 01:43:55.540]   Wow.
[01:43:55.540 --> 01:43:57.060]   So what do I point this at the--
[01:43:57.060 --> 01:43:59.940]   what do I point at the disk for if I'm downloading the software?
[01:43:59.940 --> 01:44:02.420]   So you have to pay for the content.
[01:44:02.420 --> 01:44:04.020]   Oh, you have to pay for the content.
[01:44:04.020 --> 01:44:08.020]   Or use the demo reel to activate limited content.
[01:44:08.020 --> 01:44:09.180]   So you either pay for the content
[01:44:09.180 --> 01:44:11.420]   because it sees as in app purchases.
[01:44:11.420 --> 01:44:14.940]   Or you can use the demo reel, the little disk,
[01:44:14.940 --> 01:44:17.460]   and that gives you a demo of it.
[01:44:17.460 --> 01:44:18.860]   That's really--
[01:44:18.860 --> 01:44:21.940]   Quite the same magic.
[01:44:21.940 --> 01:44:24.740]   So how much in app is it going to be, does it say?
[01:44:24.740 --> 01:44:28.380]   I think the paid for is like 15 bucks.
[01:44:28.380 --> 01:44:29.340]   What?
[01:44:29.340 --> 01:44:30.780]   For content.
[01:44:30.780 --> 01:44:31.300]   Per--
[01:44:31.300 --> 01:44:31.780]   How much is--
[01:44:31.780 --> 01:44:32.500]   For a slide.
[01:44:32.500 --> 01:44:34.020]   This is only 27 bucks.
[01:44:34.020 --> 01:44:34.380]   Whatever.
[01:44:34.380 --> 01:44:36.620]   But if you want to do anything with it,
[01:44:36.620 --> 01:44:38.940]   you got to buy another $15 program.
[01:44:38.940 --> 01:44:41.780]   But you can use any cardboard app with it, right?
[01:44:41.780 --> 01:44:43.900]   It just works with cardboard, OK.
[01:44:43.900 --> 01:44:46.420]   So yeah, so there's a lot of cardboard stuff out there.
[01:44:46.420 --> 01:44:47.700]   Yeah, there's content on YouTube.
[01:44:47.700 --> 01:44:48.860]   You can do--
[01:44:48.860 --> 01:44:51.460]   Oh, and this you do the YouTube 3D stuff--
[01:44:51.460 --> 01:44:51.820]   Yeah.
[01:44:51.820 --> 01:44:53.340]   --or the 360 stuff, too.
[01:44:53.340 --> 01:44:55.980]   Do you have a little time slider on the back
[01:44:55.980 --> 01:44:57.420]   by your eyes?
[01:44:57.420 --> 01:44:58.420]   The yellow slider here?
[01:44:58.420 --> 01:44:59.300]   Yeah, what does that do?
[01:44:59.300 --> 01:45:00.540]   That's like the magnet in the--
[01:45:00.540 --> 01:45:01.660]   That's your button.
[01:45:01.660 --> 01:45:03.540]   So we activate--
[01:45:03.540 --> 01:45:04.340]   All right, let's--
[01:45:04.340 --> 01:45:06.140]   I like the build of it.
[01:45:06.140 --> 01:45:06.900]   You know what's good.
[01:45:06.900 --> 01:45:07.420]   I like it.
[01:45:07.420 --> 01:45:08.100]   I agree with you.
[01:45:08.100 --> 01:45:13.180]   Cardboard, as a cardboard piece of hardware,
[01:45:13.180 --> 01:45:15.020]   is great because it's inexpensive,
[01:45:15.020 --> 01:45:17.780]   but it's not awesome if you use it.
[01:45:17.780 --> 01:45:19.340]   Yes, that happens.
[01:45:19.340 --> 01:45:23.140]   And it's just not durable over time, especially if you have kids.
[01:45:23.140 --> 01:45:24.380]   We're going to get this.
[01:45:24.380 --> 01:45:27.180]   We have a lot of these just for students to use in our new class.
[01:45:27.180 --> 01:45:27.740]   Cardboard.
[01:45:27.740 --> 01:45:29.140]   Not these, but we're going to get cardboard.
[01:45:29.140 --> 01:45:30.940]   We're going to get these like crazy.
[01:45:30.940 --> 01:45:31.620]   Yeah.
[01:45:31.620 --> 01:45:32.540]   How much is this thing?
[01:45:32.540 --> 01:45:34.460]   $27.
[01:45:34.460 --> 01:45:35.980]   $29. OK, whatever.
[01:45:35.980 --> 01:45:36.820]   OK, I'm going to put it again.
[01:45:36.820 --> 01:45:38.300]   It's cheap.
[01:45:38.300 --> 01:45:39.300]   Yeah.
[01:45:39.300 --> 01:45:41.060]   And it's on charge of the board.
[01:45:41.060 --> 01:45:42.540]   Where'd it go?
[01:45:42.540 --> 01:45:43.700]   Do they still have that thing?
[01:45:43.700 --> 01:45:44.340]   Oh, yeah, there it is.
[01:45:44.340 --> 01:45:44.780]   I forgot.
[01:45:44.780 --> 01:45:46.780]   There's a little.
[01:45:46.780 --> 01:45:48.780]   So now I launch it, and now I can close it.
[01:45:48.780 --> 01:45:50.100]   Well, it'll walk you through.
[01:45:50.100 --> 01:45:50.980]   So it'll tell you--
[01:45:50.980 --> 01:45:51.980]   It's going to tell me what to do.
[01:45:51.980 --> 01:45:52.980]   Let us play us.
[01:45:52.980 --> 01:45:53.980]   We can see it.
[01:45:53.980 --> 01:45:54.980]   Oh, I got it.
[01:45:54.980 --> 01:45:56.580]   Did you pay for the content?
[01:45:56.580 --> 01:45:57.660]   Did you pay for the content?
[01:45:57.660 --> 01:45:58.180]   Did you pay?
[01:45:58.180 --> 01:45:58.900]   What are you doing?
[01:45:58.900 --> 01:46:00.220]   Who are you?
[01:46:00.220 --> 01:46:01.220]   It's good.
[01:46:01.220 --> 01:46:01.780]   So hit the button.
[01:46:01.780 --> 01:46:03.460]   Are you in the EU or in America?
[01:46:03.460 --> 01:46:04.580]   Yeah.
[01:46:04.580 --> 01:46:05.700]   Get ready, EU.
[01:46:05.700 --> 01:46:07.260]   I have a pass card unlocked through up
[01:46:07.260 --> 01:46:07.540]   store.
[01:46:07.540 --> 01:46:10.220]   I have a ViewMaster demo reel.
[01:46:10.220 --> 01:46:10.900]   OK.
[01:46:10.900 --> 01:46:15.900]   Place device into your viewer at top of the phone facing left.
[01:46:15.900 --> 01:46:18.340]   Make sure top of the phone facing left,
[01:46:18.340 --> 01:46:20.260]   though I'd put it in backwards.
[01:46:20.260 --> 01:46:23.380]   Oh, for crying out loud.
[01:46:23.380 --> 01:46:24.380]   It wasn't easy.
[01:46:24.380 --> 01:46:24.900]   I can't even--
[01:46:24.900 --> 01:46:26.140]   Why can't it work that out?
[01:46:26.140 --> 01:46:28.540]   Yeah, that's color because I'll remember that.
[01:46:28.540 --> 01:46:29.900]   It knows which way is up.
[01:46:29.900 --> 01:46:32.700]   [SIGHS]
[01:46:32.700 --> 01:46:33.300]   Oh, see?
[01:46:33.300 --> 01:46:34.020]   Now it knows.
[01:46:34.020 --> 01:46:36.660]   It says, pull lever to start.
[01:46:36.660 --> 01:46:37.900]   And you've been rewarded.
[01:46:37.900 --> 01:46:40.220]   So you're a good monkey.
[01:46:40.220 --> 01:46:41.220]   All right, seal it up.
[01:46:41.220 --> 01:46:44.900]   And now the best part, Leo, looking through it.
[01:46:44.900 --> 01:46:46.380]   Leo going into the art.
[01:46:46.380 --> 01:46:47.580]   OK.
[01:46:47.580 --> 01:46:50.300]   And now it's giving me the color wheel.
[01:46:50.300 --> 01:46:52.140]   Now is it reading that disc?
[01:46:52.140 --> 01:46:52.860]   Yeah, it should.
[01:46:52.860 --> 01:46:54.700]   A little 3D world should pop up.
[01:46:54.700 --> 01:46:56.020]   Says, look at a reel.
[01:46:56.020 --> 01:47:00.420]   Oh, oh, there's no aminals on my reel.
[01:47:00.420 --> 01:47:03.220]   Oh, I wish you could see that.
[01:47:03.220 --> 01:47:05.460]   If we had a Chromecast set up, you'd cast to it.
[01:47:05.460 --> 01:47:06.780]   It's augmented reality.
[01:47:06.780 --> 01:47:07.300]   What?
[01:47:07.300 --> 01:47:08.140]   Rotate the desk.
[01:47:08.140 --> 01:47:09.140]   I don't see a feature that I want to use.
[01:47:09.140 --> 01:47:11.260]   It's augmented reality.
[01:47:11.260 --> 01:47:15.740]   Oh, the-- oh, there's-- oh, hi, little kangaroo.
[01:47:15.740 --> 01:47:16.500]   Now what do I do?
[01:47:16.500 --> 01:47:19.820]   Look at a dot and press a lever.
[01:47:19.820 --> 01:47:22.140]   Oh, that's cool.
[01:47:22.140 --> 01:47:23.460]   Yeah.
[01:47:23.460 --> 01:47:24.300]   I saw the video of it.
[01:47:24.300 --> 01:47:25.300]   You can open it.
[01:47:25.300 --> 01:47:26.980]   And it'll still play if you want to show it.
[01:47:26.980 --> 01:47:27.900]   Can I?
[01:47:27.900 --> 01:47:28.400]   Yeah.
[01:47:28.400 --> 01:47:29.340]   It'll just be running for a while.
[01:47:29.340 --> 01:47:30.420]   Because it's just a piece of crap.
[01:47:30.420 --> 01:47:32.340]   It'll stay.
[01:47:32.340 --> 01:47:33.740]   It'll give you that.
[01:47:33.740 --> 01:47:36.700]   Now how do I get back to the reel?
[01:47:36.700 --> 01:47:37.820]   Oh, now what's going on?
[01:47:37.820 --> 01:47:39.260]   OK.
[01:47:39.260 --> 01:47:41.020]   Back.
[01:47:41.020 --> 01:47:42.220]   Back, back, back, back.
[01:47:42.220 --> 01:47:43.060]   OK.
[01:47:43.060 --> 01:47:44.980]   So now press play.
[01:47:44.980 --> 01:47:47.060]   And it's going to look at a reel.
[01:47:47.060 --> 01:47:48.740]   OK.
[01:47:48.740 --> 01:47:50.660]   This is actually a very cool effect.
[01:47:50.660 --> 01:47:51.180]   Yeah.
[01:47:51.180 --> 01:47:52.220]   Oh, come on.
[01:47:52.220 --> 01:47:55.820]   No, no, no, no, just lift it up like it's in it.
[01:47:55.820 --> 01:47:58.340]   Make it go horizontal.
[01:47:58.340 --> 01:48:00.860]   There you go.
[01:48:00.860 --> 01:48:02.500]   Full lever to start.
[01:48:02.500 --> 01:48:03.020]   Oh, yeah.
[01:48:03.020 --> 01:48:04.060]   That's some trick.
[01:48:04.060 --> 01:48:05.180]   Oh, I can't.
[01:48:05.180 --> 01:48:06.260]   I have to go.
[01:48:06.260 --> 01:48:09.340]   OK, now start real quick.
[01:48:09.340 --> 01:48:09.860]   This is cool.
[01:48:09.860 --> 01:48:11.740]   Why do you see this?
[01:48:11.740 --> 01:48:13.500]   See, there's the reel?
[01:48:13.500 --> 01:48:14.340]   Yeah.
[01:48:14.340 --> 01:48:15.980]   Now watch.
[01:48:15.980 --> 01:48:17.980]   There's little animals on it.
[01:48:17.980 --> 01:48:20.100]   And then I can rotate that.
[01:48:20.100 --> 01:48:21.780]   So this is augmented reality.
[01:48:21.780 --> 01:48:24.140]   See, I hit it with my finger.
[01:48:24.140 --> 01:48:24.860]   Isn't that cool?
[01:48:24.860 --> 01:48:25.820]   It's a little bit too moving.
[01:48:25.820 --> 01:48:28.140]   It'll adjust to the angle of the disc.
[01:48:28.140 --> 01:48:30.340]   So I can pick up the disc.
[01:48:30.340 --> 01:48:32.460]   Oh, that is sweet.
[01:48:32.460 --> 01:48:33.260]   That's very sweet.
[01:48:33.260 --> 01:48:34.220]   That is pretty cute.
[01:48:34.220 --> 01:48:35.380]   And then you pick a different animal
[01:48:35.380 --> 01:48:37.180]   and you click on the little icon, the yellow icon.
[01:48:37.180 --> 01:48:38.780]   OK.
[01:48:38.780 --> 01:48:40.140]   Let's wrap it up.
[01:48:40.140 --> 01:48:42.780]   Out of you, master.
[01:48:42.780 --> 01:48:44.660]   One more ad, and then I'll let you run.
[01:48:44.660 --> 01:48:46.100]   OK, can you stay for a minute?
[01:48:46.100 --> 01:48:47.940]   Yes, I want to get your number.
[01:48:47.940 --> 01:48:48.300]   OK.
[01:48:48.300 --> 01:48:50.820]   All right, I showed you they brought to you by BrainTree.
[01:48:50.820 --> 01:48:52.180]   We love BrainTree.
[01:48:52.180 --> 01:48:54.100]   All mobile app developers should love BrainTree.
[01:48:54.100 --> 01:48:55.980]   This is a solution you've been looking for.
[01:48:55.980 --> 01:48:58.060]   A way to integrate a payment solution
[01:48:58.060 --> 01:49:00.140]   into your mobile app or your website.
[01:49:00.140 --> 01:49:02.060]   Simple 10 lines of code.
[01:49:02.060 --> 01:49:03.540]   Works with everything.
[01:49:03.540 --> 01:49:05.500]   Yeah, they love JavaScript.
[01:49:05.500 --> 01:49:07.180]   Node.js.
[01:49:07.180 --> 01:49:09.900]   Pearl, Python, Ruby, all of it.
[01:49:09.900 --> 01:49:13.260]   Look at the v.0 SDK at BrainTreePayments.com/twig
[01:49:13.260 --> 01:49:14.460]   and you will be impressed.
[01:49:14.460 --> 01:49:16.220]   And as soon as you've integrated it--
[01:49:16.220 --> 01:49:17.860]   or by the way, you can do this in the sandbox
[01:49:17.860 --> 01:49:19.620]   to get a sense of it.
[01:49:19.620 --> 01:49:22.100]   You'll be ready to accept Apple Pay and PayPal
[01:49:22.100 --> 01:49:25.140]   and Venmo and credit cards and Bitcoin.
[01:49:25.140 --> 01:49:25.660]   And you know what?
[01:49:25.660 --> 01:49:29.820]   When a new payment system comes along like, let's say,
[01:49:29.820 --> 01:49:33.860]   Android Pay, you just check a box in the config
[01:49:33.860 --> 01:49:36.060]   and boom, it's there.
[01:49:36.060 --> 01:49:37.100]   It's really critical.
[01:49:37.100 --> 01:49:39.140]   And these days, any online business
[01:49:39.140 --> 01:49:40.740]   has to add this capability.
[01:49:40.740 --> 01:49:41.580]   You've got to make payments.
[01:49:41.580 --> 01:49:43.300]   If you've got payments, you've got to make it easy.
[01:49:43.300 --> 01:49:44.140]   That's what Uber does.
[01:49:44.140 --> 01:49:46.020]   That's what Lyft does Airbnb.
[01:49:46.020 --> 01:49:49.180]   A couple of days ago, I talked to Anker Aria.
[01:49:49.180 --> 01:49:51.820]   He's the general manager for BrainTree Mobile
[01:49:51.820 --> 01:49:54.980]   about how standards have evolved in mobile payments.
[01:49:54.980 --> 01:49:56.380]   Listen.
[01:49:56.380 --> 01:49:59.020]   Buying on mobile is now becoming table stakes, right?
[01:49:59.020 --> 01:50:01.460]   I always give the example of the average mobile user.
[01:50:01.460 --> 01:50:03.420]   It may have 50 apps on their phone.
[01:50:03.420 --> 01:50:06.500]   10 of those apps have to deal with some sort of commerce.
[01:50:06.500 --> 01:50:10.060]   Five or six of them work as seamlessly as Uber and Muntry
[01:50:10.060 --> 01:50:11.620]   and Airbnb and Lyft.
[01:50:11.620 --> 01:50:13.980]   The consumer is going to have that same expectation
[01:50:13.980 --> 01:50:16.380]   from all of their buying experiences on that device.
[01:50:16.380 --> 01:50:18.420]   And so I think that's kind of the macro trend
[01:50:18.420 --> 01:50:21.140]   that we're seeing is seamless buying on a mobile device
[01:50:21.140 --> 01:50:23.860]   is becoming sort of the key to converting the users
[01:50:23.860 --> 01:50:25.900]   and keeping your mobile users happy.
[01:50:25.900 --> 01:50:29.660]   And by the way, they just acquired Harper Reads Company.
[01:50:29.660 --> 01:50:32.020]   And that's exactly what Harper Reads Company--
[01:50:32.020 --> 01:50:34.900]   can't remember the name of it-- does is kind of--
[01:50:34.900 --> 01:50:38.100]   well, the buyable pins on Pinterest are an example.
[01:50:38.100 --> 01:50:41.460]   This kind of seamless experience wherever you go,
[01:50:41.460 --> 01:50:42.860]   BrainTree is amazing.
[01:50:42.860 --> 01:50:44.660]   The payouts to you are fast.
[01:50:44.660 --> 01:50:46.620]   Support to you is continuous.
[01:50:46.620 --> 01:50:48.340]   You'll always be ready.
[01:50:48.340 --> 01:50:50.540]   And they are ready to handle you from your first dollar
[01:50:50.540 --> 01:50:51.660]   to your billionth dollar.
[01:50:51.660 --> 01:50:54.820]   That's-- look at their client list.
[01:50:54.820 --> 01:50:56.180]   You'll see fewer abandoned carts.
[01:50:56.180 --> 01:50:57.300]   You'll see more sales.
[01:50:57.300 --> 01:51:00.780]   With BrainTree's best in class mobile checkout experience.
[01:51:00.780 --> 01:51:03.020]   If you have any questions, you'd
[01:51:03.020 --> 01:51:04.260]   like to try the sandbox.
[01:51:04.260 --> 01:51:07.340]   Go to braintreepayments.com/twig.
[01:51:07.340 --> 01:51:09.740]   Braintreepayments.com/twig.
[01:51:09.740 --> 01:51:10.500]   Tell the boss.
[01:51:10.500 --> 01:51:11.940]   Tell your colleagues.
[01:51:11.940 --> 01:51:14.260]   If you're the decider, tell yourself.
[01:51:14.260 --> 01:51:16.740]   Oh, and I should tell you something else-- $50,000,
[01:51:16.740 --> 01:51:18.780]   your first $50,000 in transactions.
[01:51:18.780 --> 01:51:20.180]   Fee free.
[01:51:20.180 --> 01:51:25.020]   Braintreepayments.com/twig.
[01:51:25.020 --> 01:51:28.580]   Now, let's-- Jeff Jarvis, give us his number of the weekend
[01:51:28.580 --> 01:51:30.780]   decamp.
[01:51:30.780 --> 01:51:33.980]   Google finds out that 30% San Francisco--
[01:51:33.980 --> 01:51:37.740]   30% of 911 calls are accidental but dials.
[01:51:37.740 --> 01:51:39.660]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:51:39.660 --> 01:51:41.300]   How does Google know that?
[01:51:41.300 --> 01:51:43.340]   Because it was a 20% project because the San Francisco
[01:51:43.340 --> 01:51:44.580]   Department of Emergency Management
[01:51:44.580 --> 01:51:47.980]   wanted to know why the hell between 2011 and 2014,
[01:51:47.980 --> 01:51:50.700]   the number of calls had gone up 28%.
[01:51:50.700 --> 01:51:52.260]   More but dials.
[01:51:52.260 --> 01:51:53.220]   But dials.
[01:51:53.220 --> 01:51:53.580]   But dials.
[01:51:53.580 --> 01:51:55.740]   Oh, because it's the only button on the front page of the phone.
[01:51:55.740 --> 01:51:56.420]   Yeah.
[01:51:56.420 --> 01:51:56.780]   Bingo.
[01:51:56.780 --> 01:51:58.420]   And even if it's not a locked phone,
[01:51:58.420 --> 01:51:59.060]   right it says--
[01:51:59.060 --> 01:52:00.420]   Even if there's no SIM card in it,
[01:52:00.420 --> 01:52:02.540]   you can always make an emergency card.
[01:52:02.540 --> 01:52:04.140]   And I've almost done it.
[01:52:04.140 --> 01:52:04.620]   I'm becoming this.
[01:52:04.620 --> 01:52:05.820]   What happens is the poor--
[01:52:05.820 --> 01:52:07.860]   I mean, it's as awful as it takes resource.
[01:52:07.860 --> 01:52:09.380]   You have to call and make sure that it was.
[01:52:09.380 --> 01:52:10.380]   They don't know if it's accidental.
[01:52:10.380 --> 01:52:11.380]   Somebody called.
[01:52:11.380 --> 01:52:14.940]   I once called 911 when I was having a difficulty
[01:52:14.940 --> 01:52:16.220]   with a contractor.
[01:52:16.220 --> 01:52:19.140]   And I hung out because he left.
[01:52:19.140 --> 01:52:20.900]   And then my god, they called me back immediately.
[01:52:20.900 --> 01:52:21.180]   No, no, no, no.
[01:52:21.180 --> 01:52:22.380]   They should call you back.
[01:52:22.380 --> 01:52:22.900]   Yeah.
[01:52:22.900 --> 01:52:23.540]   Good, right?
[01:52:23.540 --> 01:52:24.220]   So they have to call.
[01:52:24.220 --> 01:52:27.060]   They have to devote a certain amount of time for their recall
[01:52:27.060 --> 01:52:28.540]   to find out that, oh, I'm sorry.
[01:52:28.540 --> 01:52:30.620]   Here's a butt dial.
[01:52:30.620 --> 01:52:32.020]   So something has to be done.
[01:52:32.020 --> 01:52:33.820]   I don't know what, but that was the first piece of data
[01:52:33.820 --> 01:52:35.420]   that showed that, so I thought it was music.
[01:52:35.420 --> 01:52:37.540]   Do you think it's more in San Francisco than--
[01:52:37.540 --> 01:52:39.500]   is there more butt dialing going on?
[01:52:39.500 --> 01:52:41.420]   I'm going to stop by stopping right now.
[01:52:41.420 --> 01:52:42.420]   Stop, stop right there.
[01:52:42.420 --> 01:52:43.740]   Stop, stop, stop, stop.
[01:52:43.740 --> 01:52:45.380]   I just can't believe I said that.
[01:52:45.380 --> 01:52:51.380]   Thank you, Jeff.
[01:52:51.380 --> 01:52:53.540]   All right, I'm going on to see a movie.
[01:52:53.540 --> 01:52:54.700]   Oh, you're going to see Jobs.
[01:52:54.700 --> 01:52:55.540]   Let us know how you like it.
[01:52:55.540 --> 01:52:56.180]   Yeah, of course he jobs.
[01:52:56.180 --> 01:52:57.540]   That's why I got to make the screening.
[01:52:57.540 --> 01:52:58.740]   Thanks, Jeff Jarvis.
[01:52:58.740 --> 01:53:00.220]   Buzzmajin.com.
[01:53:00.220 --> 01:53:00.900]   Have fun.
[01:53:00.900 --> 01:53:01.900]   Bye, his books.
[01:53:01.900 --> 01:53:02.900]   What are you guys?
[01:53:02.900 --> 01:53:03.900]   See you next Wednesday.
[01:53:03.900 --> 01:53:05.500]   Kevin Marks, anything you want to share with us,
[01:53:05.500 --> 01:53:07.020]   as long as you're still here?
[01:53:07.020 --> 01:53:08.780]   I got, well, I got a couple of things.
[01:53:08.780 --> 01:53:11.980]   Well, one was-- which I may have mentioned before,
[01:53:11.980 --> 01:53:16.180]   I'm not sure, which was the Insta-weather watch face.
[01:53:16.180 --> 01:53:17.540]   You were talking about watches.
[01:53:17.540 --> 01:53:18.380]   Yeah.
[01:53:18.380 --> 01:53:20.700]   And this-- I made this by watch face a while ago,
[01:53:20.700 --> 01:53:21.500]   and I still love it.
[01:53:21.500 --> 01:53:23.220]   I saw your raindrops.
[01:53:23.220 --> 01:53:24.660]   And that was what I was going to show you,
[01:53:24.660 --> 01:53:27.020]   the raindrops, yeah.
[01:53:27.020 --> 01:53:29.980]   So it shows you the current weather where you are.
[01:53:29.980 --> 01:53:31.780]   I just put the link in the--
[01:53:31.780 --> 01:53:32.860]   Yeah, there it is.
[01:53:32.860 --> 01:53:33.380]   I see.
[01:53:33.380 --> 01:53:36.140]   So basically, Insta-weather watch face is--
[01:53:36.140 --> 01:53:38.540]   you put it on your phone, and it gives you a really nice graph
[01:53:38.540 --> 01:53:40.700]   of what the weather's doing now and what it's going to do soon,
[01:53:40.700 --> 01:53:44.020]   and unless you click between different things.
[01:53:44.020 --> 01:53:45.780]   And then in the back-- one of the options in the background
[01:53:45.780 --> 01:53:48.700]   is to give you a nice picture of what the weather's like, which--
[01:53:48.700 --> 01:53:50.180]   No, here is usually blue skies.
[01:53:50.180 --> 01:53:52.780]   That's just what you get, because it's-- I'm in San Jose.
[01:53:52.780 --> 01:53:56.940]   And last Wednesday, there were raindrops on my watch,
[01:53:56.940 --> 01:53:58.260]   because it was actually raining outside.
[01:53:58.260 --> 01:54:01.060]   The only thing you hadn't seen in a long time--
[01:54:01.060 --> 01:54:04.180]   So the one I like is the one with the graphs on.
[01:54:04.180 --> 01:54:04.700]   Not that one.
[01:54:04.700 --> 01:54:05.980]   Next one.
[01:54:05.980 --> 01:54:06.740]   This is a video.
[01:54:06.740 --> 01:54:07.780]   We don't have any choice.
[01:54:07.780 --> 01:54:08.260]   Oh, it's a video.
[01:54:08.260 --> 01:54:09.820]   OK, sorry.
[01:54:09.820 --> 01:54:11.980]   But fortunately, they like it too.
[01:54:11.980 --> 01:54:14.060]   I thought you were doing it on your own.
[01:54:14.060 --> 01:54:15.180]   No, I'm installing it right now.
[01:54:15.180 --> 01:54:18.020]   I use a different one called Weather Face,
[01:54:18.020 --> 01:54:21.220]   but I'm going to install this Insta-weather.
[01:54:21.220 --> 01:54:23.220]   The thing I like about it is the--
[01:54:23.220 --> 01:54:25.860]   I'll see if I can get it in a state where I can check it on
[01:54:25.860 --> 01:54:26.300]   on my wrist.
[01:54:26.300 --> 01:54:28.060]   Hold on.
[01:54:28.060 --> 01:54:28.620]   Look at that.
[01:54:28.620 --> 01:54:30.260]   I can take it off my wrist at the architecture.
[01:54:30.260 --> 01:54:31.540]   Otherwise, I'm going to break my arm.
[01:54:31.540 --> 01:54:39.260]   So you get too much light again.
[01:54:39.260 --> 01:54:39.940]   Can you see that?
[01:54:39.940 --> 01:54:41.100]   Yeah.
[01:54:41.100 --> 01:54:43.180]   Well, tilt it-- yeah, the other way.
[01:54:43.180 --> 01:54:44.340]   Yeah, there you go.
[01:54:44.340 --> 01:54:45.020]   And then move that way.
[01:54:45.020 --> 01:54:46.260]   Yeah, and then go the other way.
[01:54:46.260 --> 01:54:47.140]   Now it's off.
[01:54:47.140 --> 01:54:49.060]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:54:49.060 --> 01:54:50.420]   Yeah, this is--
[01:54:50.420 --> 01:54:51.620]   I had a problem taking short of it as well.
[01:54:51.620 --> 01:54:52.620]   First, real issues.
[01:54:52.620 --> 01:54:56.060]   So you've got a little graph of the temperature coming up
[01:54:56.060 --> 01:55:00.500]   and down, and then you can switch that between temperature
[01:55:00.500 --> 01:55:03.860]   and precipitation, wind and cloud cover,
[01:55:03.860 --> 01:55:05.700]   and due point in humidity.
[01:55:05.700 --> 01:55:07.900]   Nice.
[01:55:07.900 --> 01:55:10.620]   But what I found is that it's really glanceable,
[01:55:10.620 --> 01:55:11.700]   and it's nice that it does that.
[01:55:11.700 --> 01:55:13.020]   But the other thing is it puts this little picture
[01:55:13.020 --> 01:55:15.900]   in the background of current conditions.
[01:55:15.900 --> 01:55:17.380]   Whoop.
[01:55:17.380 --> 01:55:19.700]   And what I discovered for the first time in three months
[01:55:19.700 --> 01:55:21.420]   is that it shows raindrops when it's raining.
[01:55:21.420 --> 01:55:23.180]   So that was quite cute.
[01:55:23.180 --> 01:55:24.580]   But also it's very very--
[01:55:24.580 --> 01:55:26.380]   both about San Jose weather thing.
[01:55:26.380 --> 01:55:28.780]   I have weather time, which will do the same thing.
[01:55:28.780 --> 01:55:32.700]   But this one looks even more complete.
[01:55:32.700 --> 01:55:34.060]   Now this is nice.
[01:55:34.060 --> 01:55:37.580]   It also has a radar version and all kinds of other stuff
[01:55:37.580 --> 01:55:38.060]   as well.
[01:55:38.060 --> 01:55:38.620]   Nice.
[01:55:38.620 --> 01:55:39.900]   This particularly one's pretty good.
[01:55:39.900 --> 01:55:40.340]   So I have to--
[01:55:40.340 --> 01:55:41.500]   Do I have to buy a--
[01:55:41.500 --> 01:55:43.180]   Do I have to get like--
[01:55:43.180 --> 01:55:45.060]   Do I have to get like--
[01:55:45.060 --> 01:55:49.220]   does it require an extra thing to do it, or is it--
[01:55:49.220 --> 01:55:49.900]   Is it simple?
[01:55:49.900 --> 01:55:55.540]   So basic faces are free, and then certain complications
[01:55:55.540 --> 01:55:56.260]   cost more.
[01:55:56.260 --> 01:55:58.260]   Oh, look.
[01:55:58.260 --> 01:56:00.060]   Yeah, so they've got some swivel looking ones that--
[01:56:00.060 --> 01:56:01.620]   Oh, I like the radar one.
[01:56:01.620 --> 01:56:02.620]   That's cool.
[01:56:02.620 --> 01:56:04.620]   Yeah, so it's a pretty--
[01:56:04.620 --> 01:56:06.700]   it's like someone's done a really nice graphic design
[01:56:06.700 --> 01:56:08.820]   job on good weather data.
[01:56:08.820 --> 01:56:10.580]   I think it's weather underground data.
[01:56:10.580 --> 01:56:10.980]   I'm not sure.
[01:56:10.980 --> 01:56:13.060]   But it comes up and looks nice.
[01:56:13.060 --> 01:56:14.100]   It's a satellite map.
[01:56:14.100 --> 01:56:15.420]   Neat.
[01:56:15.420 --> 01:56:15.900]   Yeah.
[01:56:15.900 --> 01:56:17.340]   So you can actually see where the rain's coming.
[01:56:17.340 --> 01:56:22.580]   So it's-- as I say, as you said, the watch thing
[01:56:22.580 --> 01:56:23.820]   isn't like--
[01:56:23.820 --> 01:56:25.340]   isn't life-changing.
[01:56:25.340 --> 01:56:27.460]   But it's interesting enough that I do bother to charge it
[01:56:27.460 --> 01:56:28.420]   every day.
[01:56:28.420 --> 01:56:30.380]   And the thing I charge it for is--
[01:56:30.380 --> 01:56:32.580]   Weather map on your watch.
[01:56:32.580 --> 01:56:36.780]   The little weather upcoming, the turn-by-turn directions
[01:56:36.780 --> 01:56:40.980]   when I'm cycling, and shouting at my wrist when I'm in the car
[01:56:40.980 --> 01:56:41.900]   to change the music.
[01:56:41.900 --> 01:56:43.460]   Yeah.
[01:56:43.460 --> 01:56:45.140]   So how do I get it to do something different?
[01:56:45.140 --> 01:56:46.580]   It's just--
[01:56:46.580 --> 01:56:47.100]   Oh, I see.
[01:56:47.100 --> 01:56:49.100]   I can add complications, I see.
[01:56:49.100 --> 01:56:50.100]   Yeah.
[01:56:50.100 --> 01:56:52.700]   And you can do more configuration on the phone.
[01:56:52.700 --> 01:56:53.620]   Right.
[01:56:53.620 --> 01:56:56.460]   It's like a big checklist UI on the phone.
[01:56:56.460 --> 01:56:57.340]   Thank you.
[01:56:57.340 --> 01:56:57.860]   Good pick.
[01:56:57.860 --> 01:56:58.260]   I like it.
[01:56:58.260 --> 01:57:00.620]   I'm going to use it.
[01:57:00.620 --> 01:57:04.540]   And you wanted to talk about comments?
[01:57:04.540 --> 01:57:06.300]   Well, this was a conversation that happened this week
[01:57:06.300 --> 01:57:10.980]   was that Motherboard, which is part of Vice that does
[01:57:10.980 --> 01:57:12.940]   Gooding Vescative Journalism, announced
[01:57:12.940 --> 01:57:14.620]   that they were giving up on commenting.
[01:57:14.620 --> 01:57:16.100]   And they said, basically--
[01:57:16.100 --> 01:57:17.420]   Everybody is, as aren't they?
[01:57:17.420 --> 01:57:19.220]   Comments, nightmare.
[01:57:19.220 --> 01:57:20.580]   And so what I was trying to do was
[01:57:20.580 --> 01:57:23.940]   get them to understand the sort of the indie web
[01:57:23.940 --> 01:57:25.220]   point of view on it.
[01:57:25.220 --> 01:57:26.860]   But I had a very nice conversation with them.
[01:57:26.860 --> 01:57:27.860]   They're basically saying, no, we have
[01:57:27.860 --> 01:57:29.140]   no development resources at all.
[01:57:29.140 --> 01:57:32.980]   We can't even add two little bits of JavaScript
[01:57:32.980 --> 01:57:35.660]   to the top and bottom of our page to do this.
[01:57:35.660 --> 01:57:37.980]   And they basically already decided they weren't going to do it.
[01:57:37.980 --> 01:57:39.700]   So that was kind of sad.
[01:57:39.700 --> 01:57:41.940]   But I wrote a little note about thinking about it.
[01:57:41.940 --> 01:57:46.140]   Because that's part of the piece of the indie web stuff
[01:57:46.140 --> 01:57:48.820]   that's actually working well is this ability
[01:57:48.820 --> 01:57:53.700]   to have the web mentions work between sites.
[01:57:53.700 --> 01:57:55.780]   And if it's just works between indie websites,
[01:57:55.780 --> 01:57:58.060]   then that's interesting.
[01:57:58.060 --> 01:58:00.460]   And you tend to get high quality comments.
[01:58:00.460 --> 01:58:02.340]   But we've also got bridges that go up
[01:58:02.340 --> 01:58:03.820]   through other social networks and bring them
[01:58:03.820 --> 01:58:05.180]   to weeks and things in as well.
[01:58:05.180 --> 01:58:07.780]   So that's sort of where we're at with this stuff.
[01:58:07.780 --> 01:58:09.780]   And it's at the point now where you could install it
[01:58:09.780 --> 01:58:12.060]   on the website and get something useful out of it.
[01:58:12.060 --> 01:58:14.460]   So that was my sort of--
[01:58:14.460 --> 01:58:16.860]   there's a bunch of interesting stuff to be done there.
[01:58:16.860 --> 01:58:20.140]   And if Jeff has some news people who are interested,
[01:58:20.140 --> 01:58:21.500]   then send them my way.
[01:58:21.500 --> 01:58:25.060]   And I'll talk to them about it.
[01:58:25.060 --> 01:58:26.340]   Very nice.
[01:58:26.340 --> 01:58:28.180]   Kevin, I want to thank you for being here.
[01:58:28.180 --> 01:58:30.500]   I don't think we could have had an intelligent discussion
[01:58:30.500 --> 01:58:32.300]   about AMP without your input.
[01:58:32.300 --> 01:58:33.380]   I hope that was helpful.
[01:58:33.380 --> 01:58:35.300]   I'll go back and play with it and see if I can work out
[01:58:35.300 --> 01:58:36.700]   whether I validated it correctly or not.
[01:58:36.700 --> 01:58:37.900]   Yeah.
[01:58:37.900 --> 01:58:38.380]   Yeah.
[01:58:38.380 --> 01:58:39.540]   I mean, I want to take a look at it.
[01:58:39.540 --> 01:58:43.380]   But I have to say, it feels like just a burden instead
[01:58:43.380 --> 01:58:44.620]   of a blessing.
[01:58:44.620 --> 01:58:46.900]   It's one more thing I have to do.
[01:58:46.900 --> 01:58:47.220]   Yes.
[01:58:47.220 --> 01:58:51.060]   Now, that is the drawback of a lot of these things.
[01:58:51.060 --> 01:58:53.100]   I mean, I think it's less that you have to do
[01:58:53.100 --> 01:58:57.060]   than the other ones perhaps.
[01:58:57.060 --> 01:59:00.220]   Well, we don't know about Apple yet.
[01:59:00.220 --> 01:59:02.460]   But in some ways, it's more than what you have to do
[01:59:02.460 --> 01:59:05.100]   with Facebook's ones, at least Facebook uses the actual image
[01:59:05.100 --> 01:59:07.180]   and video that you already have.
[01:59:07.180 --> 01:59:09.660]   Whereas this one, you've got to turn them into something else.
[01:59:09.660 --> 01:59:12.340]   Well, I have to say, I want to thank you and Jeff
[01:59:12.340 --> 01:59:14.740]   for giving me at least some empathy
[01:59:14.740 --> 01:59:18.180]   into what the record industry felt like for many years.
[01:59:18.180 --> 01:59:19.820]   I now understand.
[01:59:19.820 --> 01:59:22.140]   We always said, why doesn't the record industry get it?
[01:59:22.140 --> 01:59:24.860]   Why don't they just understand they're in a new era?
[01:59:24.860 --> 01:59:27.620]   I suddenly feel like one of those guys--
[01:59:27.620 --> 01:59:28.820]   oh, I'm screwed.
[01:59:28.820 --> 01:59:30.220]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:59:30.220 --> 01:59:30.420]   It's not--
[01:59:30.420 --> 01:59:33.820]   Well, I mean, nothing I could do about it.
[01:59:33.820 --> 01:59:35.980]   Your stuff makes sense, and you say, right, that's the thing.
[01:59:35.980 --> 01:59:36.940]   I hope so.
[01:59:36.940 --> 01:59:38.980]   And I hope my community will continue
[01:59:38.980 --> 01:59:41.180]   to partake of our programming.
[01:59:41.180 --> 01:59:43.980]   We're making the best stuff we can
[01:59:43.980 --> 01:59:45.860]   by visiting the website or downloading.
[01:59:45.860 --> 01:59:48.660]   You know, we actually are in a lot of different venues.
[01:59:48.660 --> 01:59:49.180]   Yeah.
[01:59:49.180 --> 01:59:50.860]   We don't have to-- I mean, that's-- thank you for--
[01:59:50.860 --> 01:59:53.500]   thank you to Dave Weiner and Adam Curry and the guy--
[01:59:53.500 --> 01:59:57.940]   and you for creating this whole notion of podcasting,
[01:59:57.940 --> 02:00:00.300]   of an RSS feed with the binary attachments
[02:00:00.300 --> 02:00:02.740]   that you could subscribe to and download.
[02:00:02.740 --> 02:00:06.220]   I really owe you a great debt of gratitude, actually.
[02:00:06.220 --> 02:00:08.660]   Well, I did a small part of that.
[02:00:08.660 --> 02:00:13.140]   But I think there's-- the point is that that took a long time
[02:00:13.140 --> 02:00:14.460]   to actually make start making sense,
[02:00:14.460 --> 02:00:15.860]   because at the time it was--
[02:00:15.860 --> 02:00:20.300]   you still had to plug the iPod in and sync it every day.
[02:00:20.300 --> 02:00:21.380]   Now it's easy.
[02:00:21.380 --> 02:00:22.980]   And it only started making more sense
[02:00:22.980 --> 02:00:26.020]   once you've got it in your phone and available in other places.
[02:00:26.020 --> 02:00:26.860]   Yeah.
[02:00:26.860 --> 02:00:28.980]   It's pretty-- it's actually-- maybe I'm not
[02:00:28.980 --> 02:00:31.620]   so out of style after all.
[02:00:31.620 --> 02:00:34.140]   Kevin Marks, thank you so much for being here.
[02:00:34.140 --> 02:00:35.380]   Of course, Indie Web Camp.
[02:00:35.380 --> 02:00:37.860]   I know you always like to give a little plug, a little shout out
[02:00:37.860 --> 02:00:38.660]   to Indie Web Camp.
[02:00:38.660 --> 02:00:39.820]   What's going on?
[02:00:39.820 --> 02:00:40.460]   Oh, well, yes.
[02:00:40.460 --> 02:00:42.180]   Tonight, there's Homebrew website
[02:00:42.180 --> 02:00:46.140]   club in San Francisco at--
[02:00:46.140 --> 02:00:52.020]   at Mozilla at 5.30, quite writing hours, 6.30 meeting.
[02:00:52.020 --> 02:00:55.700]   I think there's one in Portland as well tonight.
[02:00:55.700 --> 02:01:03.140]   And there was one in Edinburgh and in Malma in Sweden.
[02:01:03.140 --> 02:01:03.980]   Oh, wow.
[02:01:03.980 --> 02:01:04.740]   Yesterday.
[02:01:04.740 --> 02:01:06.020]   How cool.
[02:01:06.020 --> 02:01:09.100]   So we started to spread out.
[02:01:09.100 --> 02:01:12.100]   If you want to find out more, go to IndieWebCamp.com
[02:01:12.100 --> 02:01:14.900]   and scroll down to the Homebrew website club.
[02:01:14.900 --> 02:01:16.260]   The Homebrew website club, yes.
[02:01:16.260 --> 02:01:17.140]   Let me--
[02:01:17.140 --> 02:01:18.860]   What a great idea.
[02:01:18.860 --> 02:01:19.540]   That is awesome.
[02:01:19.540 --> 02:01:21.940]   And you'll see there's lots of meetings.
[02:01:21.940 --> 02:01:25.180]   Malmo, Edinburgh, Portland, and San Francisco.
[02:01:25.180 --> 02:01:28.580]   It's normally every two weeks.
[02:01:28.580 --> 02:01:29.060]   Great.
[02:01:29.060 --> 02:01:30.940]   That's a great picture there.
[02:01:30.940 --> 02:01:33.300]   Thank you, Kevin.
[02:01:33.300 --> 02:01:34.780]   Have a great week.
[02:01:34.780 --> 02:01:36.140]   We'll see you soon.
[02:01:36.140 --> 02:01:36.660]   See you soon.
[02:01:36.660 --> 02:01:38.260]   Want to thank you all for joining us?
[02:01:38.260 --> 02:01:40.100]   We do this week in Google.
[02:01:40.100 --> 02:01:42.740]   It's my Friday, your Wednesday, about 130 Pacific,
[02:01:42.740 --> 02:01:47.940]   430 Eastern time, 2030 UTC on twit.tv/live.
[02:01:47.940 --> 02:01:50.620]   You can watch live if you would like to.
[02:01:50.620 --> 02:01:52.620]   We certainly love it if you do.
[02:01:52.620 --> 02:01:54.860]   But if you can't be here live and in person,
[02:01:54.860 --> 02:01:57.220]   well, you can always watch after the fact.
[02:01:57.220 --> 02:02:01.780]   We have on-demand audio and video available at twit.tv/twig.
[02:02:01.780 --> 02:02:05.780]   And of course, on every podcast platform known to man,
[02:02:05.780 --> 02:02:09.900]   including Roku, there are apps on all the platforms.
[02:02:09.900 --> 02:02:12.740]   It's everywhere you want it to be, everywhere you are.
[02:02:12.740 --> 02:02:15.740]   I hope you'll take Twit along and Twig along with you,
[02:02:15.740 --> 02:02:16.420]   wherever you go.
[02:02:16.420 --> 02:02:17.700]   Thanks for joining us.
[02:02:17.700 --> 02:02:19.820]   We'll see you next time on This Week in Google.
