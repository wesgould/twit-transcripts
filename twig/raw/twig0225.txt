[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   It's time for Twig this weekend. Google Jeff Jarvis has the week off, but Kevin Marx is here.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.200]   Believe it or not, we'll talk about programming philosophies, but also a lot of Google news.
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.000]   Stay tuned. This week in Google is next.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000]   Netcast you love.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   From people you trust.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   This is Twig.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   Bandwidth for this week in Google is provided by CashFly, C-A-C-H-E-F-L-Y.com.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:43.000]   It's time for Twig this week in Google, episode 225, recorded November 20, 2013.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   Crows are hot.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   It's time for Twig this week in Google to show the covers of the Googleverse, the cloud,
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   and anything we darn well want to talk about, Gina Turbani,
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   is here from ThinkUp, from SmarterWare.org,
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   now the editor of Life Hacker soon to be Brookalite.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   Yeah, hello.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   Have you started packing yet?
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   Oh, have we started packing? You can't see the boxes in this shot,
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   but basically everything outside of the shot is just cardboard boxes.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   I hate moving. I hate moving.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   We try not to be cranky about it, but it's going to be a good move.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   Having moved now and unpacked, and there's no box left behind,
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   it's a nice feeling.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   It's worth it. On the other end, it's worth it.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   It's worth it.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   And, especially since you're going somewhere wonderful.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   Yeah.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   You might also say, as we did, I will never move again.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   I really hope that that.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   I don't want to move for a very long time if I ever do it again.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   I need to be long enough that I've forgotten the trauma of doing it.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   Yeah, well, that's like childbirth.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   Yeah.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   Yeah.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   And that's my line is, you know, the next time I move,
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   I want it to be in a pine box.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   Oh.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   They'll carry me out of this house in a pine box.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   Either that or rich enough that I can have people come in,
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   pack all my stuff for me, carry it, organize something.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   You know, that's overrated.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   So I did that kind of.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   I packed a few things that I was nervous about, but I ran out of time.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   So we just, I said, you're going to have to pack it.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   And they did promise they pack everything.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   And they pack it in no particular order.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   Right.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   Well, that's what happened.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   So we're like, where's the US?
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   It's, pardon me?
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Well, when we moved to the US, that's what happened with us.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   Basically, you know, apples as part of the relocation thing said,
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   oh, we'll pack your house and ship it over and we'll go with it.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   Oh, great.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   And it's 15 years later.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   And it's, I still have some boxes I haven't unpacked.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   I took a, you know, cleared a block of them in the garage.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   It was like, well, they really did wrap everything in the kitchen up and bits of paper and put it in the box.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   Exactly.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   Exactly.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   And no, and it's like a battery wrapped in paper.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   And the bottom.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   I need to be rich enough to have somebody pack it all up for me and then unpack it for me.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   That's what I figured.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   I think what I thought is, okay, the solution for this is a personal assistant.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   Because then you say, okay, you know, put everything in order.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   Do it.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   Do it.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   Do it.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   I think what you really want is someone who handles the state sales and say, okay, pretend I died.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   Sell it all.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   Sell it all.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   Sell it all.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Sell all this crap.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   That's true.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Um, let us talk by, oh, I didn't even make.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   I'm so sorry.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   Jeff Jarvis has a British accent.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   We don't know why.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   No.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   Jeff, where is Jeff?
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   Jeff is off today.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   He's traveling here in here.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   I think they're in fifth.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   He mentioned it last weekend.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   He did say it last night.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   He's on a plane.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   I'm not sure.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   He's on a WF thing in Abu Dhabi.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   Is he that one?
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   Something like that.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   The season's Spain.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   Yeah, that's a good.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   The Fanya.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   But good news, as always, the wonderful Kevin Marks is here and we love Kevin.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   Thank you.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.640]   And he's out on his patio with occasional rain gusts going through.
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.000]   So that's just what you.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   So I have a, I have a weather mount to check.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   And let us know if a cell approach.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   I'm using case.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.280]   So we're glad to have you.
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.640]   Thank you for being here.
[00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:16.640]   Where do we start?
[00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:21.640]   Where do we start?
[00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.680]   I could, I guess we could start with a change-long actually.
[00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:25.680]   You want to do that?
[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.280]   We never, we always bury the lead.
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.280]   I think we should.
[00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:29.280]   Let's, let's.
[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.280]   Wow, the lead.
[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.280]   All right.
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.280]   Sure.
[00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:33.280]   Well, I think in this case there's some pretty big news.
[00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.720]   There is some pretty big news here.
[00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:35.720]   So break out the trumpets.
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.160]   It's time for the change-long.
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:43.920]   The Google change-long.
[00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:48.480]   Gina Trapani with the latest from Google.
[00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.800]   Google Play Music is now available on iOS.
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:52.800]   Yes.
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.800]   Oh, I'm so happy about this.
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.720]   Yeah, really, really, really cool.
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.280]   Free version of the app allows you to access your existing library that's stored in the
[00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:01.840]   cloud in Google Play Music.
[00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:07.040]   So what you have to do to get music in Google Play Music if you're on iOS is you have to
[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:12.200]   give to buy singles or records through Google's storefront, which is only available on Android
[00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:16.720]   or the web because iOS has that whole thing about buying stuff as in you can't buy anything
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.040]   from anyone except Apple.
[00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:24.600]   Or you can just sync your entire local library up to Google Play using their Music Manager
[00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.960]   app, which is free for Windows and Mac.
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.600]   And then all your music will be up in the cloud and you can listen to it using the new
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.320]   iOS app.
[00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:37.400]   The new iOS app for Google Play Music also supports all access, which is Google Play Music's streaming
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.400]   product.
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:43.560]   It's about, I think it's $9.99 a month and there's a 30-day free trial if you just want
[00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:44.560]   to try it out.
[00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:47.840]   And like I said, that's included in the new iOS app.
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.200]   And overall, I mean, it's really nice.
[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:51.840]   Chad's playing the demo video here.
[00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.480]   It looks a lot like the Android version.
[00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:58.880]   In fact, it uses a lot of sort of Android's design conventions, which is interesting, and
[00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.440]   seems to look really good.
[00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:04.680]   Really the only thing that you can't do is upload music to it or buy music from it.
[00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:08.400]   And that's an Apple, you know, that's because they don't want to give Apple 30%.
[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:09.400]   Right.
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:10.400]   Yeah.
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.400]   Exactly.
[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:14.800]   Well, and I'm not sure that, I thought that at iOS you couldn't, you actually couldn't
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.600]   set it up so that users can purchase stuff.
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:21.040]   We could be in an app purchase, but you would Apple would take 30%.
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:23.040]   Oh, it would be in an app purchase, right?
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:24.040]   Right, right, right.
[00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:25.040]   Right.
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.040]   So you can't do it.
[00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.040]   Kindle does the same thing.
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:30.840]   So Kindle does the same thing because Amazon doesn't want to give 30% to Apple.
[00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:35.240]   So what it says you want, and Audible does it, you want to buy a book, go to our website.
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:36.240]   Right.
[00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:37.240]   Right.
[00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:38.240]   But it kind of should give you a link to the website.
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.240]   No, no, can't even do that.
[00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:40.240]   It has to say in text.
[00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.240]   You can go and type this in your website.
[00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.880]   Go to the web.
[00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:49.560]   The other missing feature is it is iPhone only, although you, you know, I'm putting
[00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:52.560]   it out of my, it's a little large on my 10 inch.
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:54.360]   Oh, is that silly?
[00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:55.360]   Yeah.
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:06:56.360]   I pad.
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:57.800]   They might do it eventually.
[00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:01.840]   It's loading my library now because I did this before and I have all my music on Google
[00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:02.840]   Play.
[00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:03.840]   You can do what is it?
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:04.840]   25,000 songs for free.
[00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:05.840]   20,000.
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:06.840]   20.
[00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:09.960]   So I'm, I think it's you, if you bought the old access thing, what you want to do is just
[00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:11.400]   think the ones that they haven't got.
[00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:12.880]   And then, then, then it's pretty good.
[00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:15.360]   But that means you've got to sit there and work out, which is which.
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:16.360]   Yeah.
[00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:18.120]   So I just, I just let it run forever.
[00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:19.920]   It's always, it's a little dongle.
[00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:21.280]   It always runs.
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:26.320]   So you have listen now, which is what, you know, my library.
[00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:32.120]   So this is stuff that I either own or is on my hard drive.
[00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:35.240]   It does not, it's nice because it imports the iTunes playlists.
[00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:38.560]   So my iTunes playlists got moved up, which is really, really great.
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:39.560]   Yeah, very nice.
[00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:40.560]   Yeah.
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:44.100]   And then, and then if you have all access, you also have, you do need all access to the
[00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:45.100]   radio, right?
[00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:46.100]   Or not.
[00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:47.100]   Yeah.
[00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:48.100]   Yes.
[00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:54.160]   No, it'll, it'll do something a bit like it, which is, which you'll do a shuffle from the
[00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:57.120]   stuff you've got if you don't have all access.
[00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:02.120]   And then, as you see, up to 10 devices and this is, this is 11.
[00:08:02.120 --> 00:08:03.120]   Wow.
[00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:04.120]   Yeah.
[00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:06.120]   I'm like, shades of iTunes.
[00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:07.120]   Yeah.
[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:09.680]   But it's actually, it's not too bad because you can, it's not like the Apple one.
[00:08:09.680 --> 00:08:13.280]   You can actually delete ones that you've erased, whereas the Apple one, you can't.
[00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:15.840]   So you have to bang your head against the wall with it.
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:16.840]   Right.
[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:20.520]   No, I think, with the Google one, it's, I hate, I hit the same problem because it's like,
[00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:22.720]   you know, I've churned so many devices.
[00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:25.800]   I was able to just go through and go, yeah, not that one, not that one, not that one.
[00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:27.440]   And it just disappeared and it was happy again.
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:28.440]   Yeah, that's nice.
[00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:31.400]   That's, at least Google gives you that facility.
[00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:38.800]   And I, you know, I've tried Spotify, RDO, MOG, Xbox music, and really Google is as good
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:40.200]   as if not better.
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:43.000]   In fact, I like radio, Google radio better than Pandora.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.240]   I, I, it seems to be a better mix for me.
[00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:47.440]   So, well, it doesn't play ads as well.
[00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:49.240]   Well, I pay for Pandora.
[00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:50.240]   So I don't get it out.
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:51.240]   Yeah.
[00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:55.920]   But the, the, the other, does it have the pinning thing?
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:56.920]   Does that work on this as well?
[00:08:56.920 --> 00:09:00.640]   Oh, let me see where you can say you take this offline.
[00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:02.640]   Yeah.
[00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:05.400]   So I'm going to, because my nothing is on this.
[00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:10.840]   So let's say I want to take the, yeah, radio, get original.
[00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:14.480]   So if you click, if you click on a song or an album, you should see it like a, yeah, it's
[00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:15.480]   like a down load.
[00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:16.480]   Yeah.
[00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:17.480]   There's a down load.
[00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:18.480]   And then I get the same.
[00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:19.480]   Oh, then you get the dirt.
[00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:20.480]   No, but I'll fix that.
[00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:21.480]   Yeah.
[00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:22.480]   Yeah.
[00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:26.640]   So, you know, yeah, it's, it's kind of big if you use it on a, on an iPad, but it works
[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:27.640]   great.
[00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:30.760]   And I, and the fact that you even have it is huge because we've had to use a third party,
[00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:33.240]   not such great solution up to now.
[00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:34.240]   Right.
[00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.240]   For a while.
[00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:36.240]   Yep.
[00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:37.240]   Thank you, Google.
[00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:38.240]   Cool.
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:39.240]   Cool.
[00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:40.240]   Yeah.
[00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:41.240]   Cool.
[00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:42.240]   Yeah.
[00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:43.240]   And just add it to Sonos and you will be perfect.
[00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:44.240]   Nice.
[00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:45.240]   Well, that's what this would be.
[00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:46.240]   Google search.
[00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:47.240]   I'm sorry, Kevin.
[00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:48.240]   So this is what the crime cost is for is.
[00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:49.240]   Yeah.
[00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:55.960]   So, Google search for Android got an update this week and in, and among other features,
[00:09:55.960 --> 00:10:01.320]   biggest feature that it added is this series style sort of conversational voice commands.
[00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:05.720]   So the only example that I've tried and seen of this is send me a text message.
[00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:11.880]   So if you go, okay, Google, send a text message instead of just launching your, your text
[00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:14.280]   message app, it'll say, who do you want to send it to?
[00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.080]   And then you say a name and you can choose the person.
[00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:17.880]   Have you tried this out yet, Leo?
[00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:19.720]   Send a text message.
[00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:21.760]   I tried it.
[00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:24.480]   Send a text message to Leo.
[00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:28.800]   The problem is it's not completely hands-free because at the very end, you still have to
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:30.320]   press the screen and say send it.
[00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:31.800]   It says, what's the message?
[00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:32.800]   Yeah.
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:33.800]   Hello, Leo.
[00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:34.800]   This is my text message.
[00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:35.800]   That didn't work.
[00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:36.800]   Oh, there it is.
[00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:43.240]   And I've been for a long time just saying the whole thing.
[00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:45.040]   Send a message to Kevin title, you know, subject.
[00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:46.200]   This is my message.
[00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:48.400]   Body, this is my message.
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:51.320]   And Siri, of course, has done this for a long time too.
[00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:52.680]   So it is a nice feature.
[00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:53.680]   I like it.
[00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:58.520]   And I want it to be totally hands-free because the final interaction should be, okay, I've
[00:10:58.520 --> 00:10:59.520]   got your message.
[00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:00.520]   Here's the message.
[00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:01.520]   Read it back.
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:02.520]   Would you like me to send it?
[00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:03.520]   And I could say yes.
[00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:04.520]   Yes.
[00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:05.520]   Right.
[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:06.520]   Right.
[00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:07.520]   So in the end, you have to actually tap, tap, okay, or yes, yes.
[00:11:07.520 --> 00:11:13.760]   I was also trying things like, you know, okay, Google, how far is LA from here?
[00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:15.800]   You know, what's the weather there?
[00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:18.200]   And it would, you know, tell me the weather in LA.
[00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:21.240]   That conversational, it knew that they're men's Los Angeles.
[00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:22.240]   Yeah.
[00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:23.240]   That is really cool.
[00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:24.240]   That's awesome.
[00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:25.240]   That's awesome.
[00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:26.240]   That's awesome.
[00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:27.240]   That's awesome.
[00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:28.240]   That's awesome.
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:32.920]   By the way, I just, I'm just checking because I have 17,558 songs out of the 20,000 max on
[00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:33.920]   my Google library.
[00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:36.120]   Wow, you're getting there.
[00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:37.120]   I'm getting there.
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:38.120]   Yeah.
[00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:39.120]   Yeah, so that's what I'm saying.
[00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:43.200]   But the thing is, if you've got all access, then all the, you know, the obvious mainstream
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:44.200]   ones are in that anyway.
[00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:45.200]   Right.
[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:47.360]   And then you use the library for your more obscure ones.
[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:50.400]   But that, well, yeah, but it's a pain behind.
[00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:51.880]   No, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:56.240]   But, you know, once you hit the limit, then it's, but that's, you know, it's like, oh,
[00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:59.440]   but the problem I have with it is it's still not very good at classical, which none of
[00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:00.960]   these things are.
[00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:08.200]   So they don't seem to, their display is based around a song made by an artist in an album
[00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:10.640]   and doesn't have a notion of a performance.
[00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:11.640]   Oh, yeah.
[00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:12.640]   You can't get it.
[00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:13.640]   It's like that.
[00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:14.640]   Yeah, you get a movement.
[00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:15.640]   And they don't display properly.
[00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:16.640]   Right.
[00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:17.640]   On the screen.
[00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:19.320]   And the Chromecast gets this wrong too.
[00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:20.520]   But then everyone gets that wrong.
[00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:23.520]   So I'm not sure what the right answer that is about from like, start listening to more
[00:12:23.520 --> 00:12:25.480]   ASAP Rocky and less.
[00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:26.480]   Bocky.
[00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:28.160]   I mean, it's like Google doesn't employ people who play classical music.
[00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:29.160]   So it's, it's a good.
[00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:32.600]   If there's a strong correlation between those engineers.
[00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:37.160]   I have a large class, you probably do a large classical music collection in my music and
[00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:39.840]   I just listen to, I make a playlist and listen to that.
[00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:40.840]   Yeah.
[00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:41.840]   Yeah.
[00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:42.840]   So that's what you have to do.
[00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:43.840]   But it's frustrating.
[00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:51.080]   If you say, okay, I want, you know, Beethoven's sixth symphony, then you get like really random
[00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:55.400]   stuff in the album because it's like 1000 best Beethoven tracks.
[00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:56.400]   Exactly.
[00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:58.360]   It's like, no, I actually want the Von Kärger version.
[00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:00.440]   And it's like, it's really quite hard to do.
[00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:01.840]   Good luck finding that.
[00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:02.840]   Yeah.
[00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:03.840]   Yeah.
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:07.680]   So I searched for Beethoven and I got, well, you know, you got some stuff.
[00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:09.400]   I get camper van Beethoven, but that's okay.
[00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:10.880]   I like them.
[00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:12.560]   And top songs from Beethoven.
[00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:13.560]   Did you know this?
[00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:17.640]   The top songs are Moonlight Sonata, Fury Least, the fifth symphony, Moonlight Salata and Fury
[00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:18.640]   Least.
[00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:19.640]   Yeah.
[00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:25.920]   And the other thing is it doesn't, when you search for an artist, it gives you the albums
[00:13:25.920 --> 00:13:27.480]   and it doesn't put the dates in that display.
[00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:28.720]   You have to click through it if I had the dates.
[00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:30.560]   It's very annoying when you try to remember.
[00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:33.720]   I remember which year that was, but I don't know which album it was on.
[00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:34.720]   Right.
[00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:35.720]   Right.
[00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:37.720]   I wonder what I'd get if I did Beethoven radio.
[00:13:37.720 --> 00:13:38.720]   Okay.
[00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:42.840]   And unlimited rejects, right?
[00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:44.840]   I can move another bit of skips.
[00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:46.840]   I got to cut in Fugue.
[00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:47.840]   Unlike.
[00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:48.840]   We'll see.
[00:13:48.840 --> 00:13:49.840]   And all middles.
[00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:51.720]   You can see what's upcoming as well if you click on the little thing at the top.
[00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:53.280]   The note with the lines at the top.
[00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:54.280]   Yeah.
[00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:55.280]   So they can show me what's coming.
[00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:56.280]   And they can show you.
[00:13:56.280 --> 00:14:00.800]   If you didn't like Ticata and Fugue the first time, you get it another time and you get...
[00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:03.280]   Yeah, you can reorder and delete those as well.
[00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:05.120]   Ticata and Fugue isn't actually Beethoven.
[00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:08.040]   Well, no, but it's Beethoven radio.
[00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:09.040]   So it's...
[00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:10.040]   Okay.
[00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:11.040]   Yeah.
[00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:12.040]   So you can...
[00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:13.040]   This is Mendelssohn right now.
[00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:15.920]   I don't know if this... anybody really thinks that this is classical music.
[00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:21.800]   This is... this is like music play there.
[00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:22.800]   Recital.
[00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:23.800]   Yes.
[00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:27.600]   And so, and if you... I think if you tap and hold, you can reorder the queue.
[00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:28.600]   That's neat.
[00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:29.600]   Pretty far in the future.
[00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:30.600]   And you can remove things from the queue.
[00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:32.600]   If you throw them sideways, they delete.
[00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:33.600]   I think...
[00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:34.600]   Hithium.
[00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:35.600]   Oh, this is happening.
[00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:36.600]   So yeah.
[00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:39.720]   Don't forget, this is Apple.
[00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:41.200]   We don't have that facility.
[00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:42.200]   Right.
[00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:43.200]   That's right.
[00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:44.200]   That's right.
[00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:45.200]   We may not have a movie either.
[00:14:45.200 --> 00:14:47.640]   They were showing the movie in the demo video.
[00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:48.640]   Oh.
[00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:49.640]   If you tap...
[00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:50.640]   Well, this is radio, remember.
[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:51.640]   This is not...
[00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:52.640]   Oh, that's radio.
[00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:53.640]   Yeah.
[00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:54.640]   This is not my playlists.
[00:14:54.640 --> 00:14:55.640]   Right.
[00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:56.640]   This is another thing.
[00:14:56.640 --> 00:14:57.640]   I don't know.
[00:14:57.640 --> 00:14:58.640]   And this is an Apple issue.
[00:14:58.640 --> 00:14:59.640]   I don't know how to get out of this screen.
[00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:00.640]   I don't swipe the top of the video.
[00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:01.640]   Right.
[00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:02.640]   I can throw...
[00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:03.640]   I see why I do this here.
[00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:04.640]   I can throw them sideways or Android and they go away.
[00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:05.640]   Yeah, that may just be because I was listening to radio.
[00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:06.640]   This is radio.
[00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:11.960]   Here's the 99 most essential Beethoven masterpieces.
[00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:12.960]   Swipe that out.
[00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:14.800]   Swipe that away.
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:16.280]   Swipe that away.
[00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:17.280]   Reorder this.
[00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:18.280]   Reorder this.
[00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:19.280]   Play this faster.
[00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:26.000]   So when Android, there's a little thing on the left that looks like a handle of phones
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:27.600]   that you can drag them down by.
[00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:28.600]   Yeah.
[00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:29.600]   That is in the iOS app.
[00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:30.600]   That's definitely in the demo video.
[00:15:30.600 --> 00:15:31.600]   I'm just trying to remember how...
[00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:33.880]   I'm just trying to see how you get that.
[00:15:33.880 --> 00:15:34.880]   Is it?
[00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:38.880]   So it's actually really bad UX because on the right hand side, you've got the three dots
[00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:39.880]   menu on the left hand side.
[00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:44.360]   You've got the three little lines, which is the drag performance.
[00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:47.640]   So yeah, then you can drag them down.
[00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:48.640]   See that?
[00:15:48.640 --> 00:15:51.000]   Anyway, everybody should.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:56.320]   You can do this for free with your own collection up to 20,000 songs.
[00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:59.360]   If you want the all access, you have to pay 10 bucks.
[00:15:59.360 --> 00:16:01.360]   But I think it's nice.
[00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:04.200]   And the all access is there's a free trial, so you can try it out.
[00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:05.200]   Nice.
[00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:10.840]   And the other thing I found with it is that if there's something I want to buy and it's
[00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:17.440]   on iTunes, but it's not on this, if you have the Google Sync thing running on whichever
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:21.480]   Mac you work the iTunes on, then you buy it from iTunes, it syncs up to this and you
[00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:22.480]   can play it on these.
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:25.560]   So you don't have to deal with iTunes, like clicking everything down, loading it.
[00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:26.880]   So that's quite well.
[00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:33.600]   So there was some Caroline Pen on the voice that my wife really liked.
[00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:35.640]   So it's like, oh, I buy her EP.
[00:16:35.640 --> 00:16:39.520]   And because I bought it on there, it synced across to all the Android devices and because
[00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:40.800]   it was in the library.
[00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:42.680]   So that's what you need.
[00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:43.680]   Cool.
[00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:45.560]   What else is new at Google?
[00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:47.800]   Working as it's supposed to be.
[00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:50.160]   We got a new Android app from Google.
[00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:51.160]   Just came out today.
[00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:52.160]   It's called Newsstand.
[00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:54.280]   This is a rumored for a couple of weeks now.
[00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:55.680]   Finally came to fruition.
[00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:58.320]   It's in the Play Store right now, Google Play Newsstand.
[00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:02.680]   What it does is basically combines Play Magazine and Current.
[00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:07.640]   So it lets you read from news sources, magazines, and also RSS feeds.
[00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:11.120]   And it learns what you're interested in as you read.
[00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:14.920]   The app launches with full-length content from newspapers, like The Times, The Wall Street
[00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:16.840]   Journal, The Financial Times.
[00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:18.120]   And it actually supports payroll.
[00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:19.120]   Pay walls.
[00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:22.560]   So with the New York Times, for example, if you don't have a subscription, but you read
[00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:27.160]   a full article, you get an allocation of like 15 articles per month.
[00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:33.080]   When you read it in Play Newsstand, it will count towards your allocation.
[00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:34.520]   And yeah, it looks really nice.
[00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:38.800]   I literally just downloaded it and haven't had a chance to play with it too much.
[00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:42.720]   But basically, the more you use it, it learns what you're interested in.
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:47.640]   And we'll show you there's a Read Now section right at the top of the app.
[00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:50.920]   And it'll kind of present you with stories and things that you're interested in.
[00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:53.560]   It's hard to see some of this happening in Google now.
[00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:58.200]   Like I've searched for information about whatever, some news story.
[00:17:58.200 --> 00:17:59.960]   And then later on, I'll see a Google Now card.
[00:17:59.960 --> 00:18:04.600]   I'm kind of hoping I think that Google, this Google Play Newsstand will kind of be that,
[00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:06.080]   but just on crack.
[00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:12.320]   And it can import your subscriptions from Currents and Play Magazines as well.
[00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:13.320]   This is interesting.
[00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:14.320]   All right.
[00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:19.800]   So I don't use Play Magazine, but I do use Currents.
[00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:24.560]   So does this is this going to replace, eat both of those or?
[00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:26.720]   By the way, I noticed that I got it.
[00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:28.040]   I didn't have to install it.
[00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:29.040]   Yeah.
[00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:30.520]   Yeah, I got it automatically as well.
[00:18:30.520 --> 00:18:31.520]   Yeah.
[00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:32.520]   Yeah.
[00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:33.520]   Let's see.
[00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:37.360]   It brings the features of Play Magazine's and Currents into a single interface.
[00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:40.160]   Play Magazine's was just a magazine store.
[00:18:40.160 --> 00:18:42.600]   And then Currents was more like a flip board style app.
[00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:47.360]   So it really is a new, it's a new, I mean, I see Read Now.
[00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:51.920]   I see My News, which allows you to add sources.
[00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:54.440]   So I bet this is replacing Currents.
[00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:55.440]   I mean.
[00:18:55.440 --> 00:18:57.760]   Yeah, it's not, it looks like it is.
[00:18:57.760 --> 00:18:58.760]   Yeah.
[00:18:58.760 --> 00:19:01.240]   It is going to replace those two.
[00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:02.240]   Yeah.
[00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:03.760]   So my magazine's come this.
[00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:07.440]   I have that this free Men's Health magazine, I think, from IO.
[00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:08.440]   Aren't you lucky?
[00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:09.440]   Aren't you lucky?
[00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:10.440]   Aren't I lucky?
[00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:12.440]   That's always what I want.
[00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:13.440]   Fascinating.
[00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:17.480]   It's like cologne ads and expensive watches.
[00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:18.480]   Yeah.
[00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:21.680]   Yeah, that's what we men like, you know.
[00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:23.400]   Cologne watches.
[00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:28.160]   So I mean, this is kind of like, it's not quite, but kind of like the new Google Reader, right?
[00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:32.800]   I mean, but this is, but this is magazine content and RSS feeds in the same place.
[00:19:32.800 --> 00:19:33.800]   Oh wow, interesting.
[00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:36.400]   So I've just added science and technology.
[00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:40.080]   There are paid magazines, but there's also free news in here as well.
[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:43.840]   And I can add sources like space.com popular science.
[00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:46.800]   CNET's already added solve for X.
[00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:49.240]   That's the Google, those great Google lectures.
[00:19:49.240 --> 00:19:51.160]   This is interesting.
[00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:52.160]   Yeah.
[00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:53.160]   Yeah.
[00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:57.600]   And gadget, gizmodo, Mashable, the Verge.
[00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:58.600]   Huh.
[00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:00.720]   All right, I guess I'll be using this more.
[00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:03.080]   It's not exactly a flip board.
[00:20:03.080 --> 00:20:04.960]   It's not exactly a flip board.
[00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:09.040]   It's got a very, it's got kind of the standard Android design, like the most modern sort
[00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:13.520]   of jelly bean design or I guess KitKat now.
[00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:15.560]   Yeah, I'm adding science and technology now.
[00:20:15.560 --> 00:20:16.560]   It's a long scroll.
[00:20:16.560 --> 00:20:19.840]   I wonder, does it look different on tablets or is this just the look?
[00:20:19.840 --> 00:20:22.280]   It's just a long scroll.
[00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:23.280]   It's pretty though.
[00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:24.480]   That's a good question.
[00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:26.280]   And I could see what category everything is.
[00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:27.280]   And you know what?
[00:20:27.280 --> 00:20:29.040]   It's a little bit like Google plus.
[00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:30.040]   It is.
[00:20:30.040 --> 00:20:33.920]   If you turn your phone landscape, it does really organize itself.
[00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:37.120]   So it does look like on tablets, it'll be more like a tile.
[00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:39.000]   I think I turned that.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   I'm going to play out.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   I don't like my screen to rotate spontaneously.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   All right.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   Yeah.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   So if you have an up to date Android phone.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.840]   Google play newsstand.
[00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:55.240]   And it shows up in your app drawer.
[00:20:55.240 --> 00:20:56.320]   It took me forever to find it.
[00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:58.320]   It's play a newsstand in your app drawer.
[00:20:58.320 --> 00:20:59.320]   Right.
[00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:00.320]   They hide the play stuff.
[00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:02.880]   Not a huge fan of these like these play naming conventions.
[00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:03.880]   Yeah.
[00:21:03.880 --> 00:21:05.800]   What else do we have?
[00:21:05.800 --> 00:21:08.040]   The Google wallet card.
[00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:09.160]   It is official.
[00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:12.880]   So if you're a Google wallet user, you can sign up now to get a physical card.
[00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:18.280]   This is a physical plastic prepaid debit card that allows you to access your wallet balance
[00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:22.760]   at real world, in the world world at ATMs and banks, basically wherever MasterCard debit
[00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:24.720]   is accepted.
[00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:28.800]   So yeah, the card basically lets you pay with whatever you have on your wallet balance.
[00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:33.560]   So it doesn't like replace all of your other cards.
[00:21:33.560 --> 00:21:37.880]   But if you hook up your bank accounts and your cards into your Google wallet account,
[00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:40.840]   you can add to your balance and use that card.
[00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:45.040]   You can go to your Google wallets account right now and sign up for it.
[00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:46.040]   It's free.
[00:21:46.040 --> 00:21:47.040]   I just said, hey, send me one.
[00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:48.440]   And it said, OK, it's a plastic card.
[00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:49.440]   Yeah.
[00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:50.440]   Yeah.
[00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:55.120]   So kind of interesting that this news dropped this week, especially right after the coin
[00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:57.720]   announcement.
[00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:00.520]   But this I went for because I actually actually use Google Wallet.
[00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:04.880]   And there are times when if there isn't Tap to Pay or, you know, if I'm at a retailer
[00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:10.800]   that doesn't support Google Wallet, you know, the digital version, you just swipe this card.
[00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:11.800]   So we're OK.
[00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:12.800]   So I'm in my wallet.
[00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:13.800]   I can send money.
[00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:16.800]   I could save offers and loyalty programs, latest transactions.
[00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:19.000]   But where do I order the card?
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   Is it?
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   Let's see.
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   Didn't offer me.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   See, I did it earlier.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   Let me look this up.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   Learn about sending money.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   I don't have this work.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.520]   I suggest location.
[00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:32.560]   So on the left side, there's transactions payment methods, offers, loyalty programs.
[00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:36.080]   I have a wallet app and card.
[00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:38.080]   Do you see that?
[00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:40.040]   Maybe it just hasn't gotten around to it.
[00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:41.040]   Yeah.
[00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:46.160]   If you go to wallet and click the cog in the corner, then you can get to it from that.
[00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:47.160]   The hamburger.
[00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:48.160]   Of course.
[00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:49.720]   The cog in the corner.
[00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:51.680]   There's a cog in the corner.
[00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:56.480]   All I see is I see the three dot menus and I see the hamburger.
[00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:58.480]   My wallet send money transactions.
[00:22:58.480 --> 00:22:59.480]   I was on the web.
[00:22:59.480 --> 00:23:00.480]   Sorry.
[00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:01.480]   You're on the web.
[00:23:01.480 --> 00:23:02.480]   On the Android app.
[00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:08.520]   Yeah, on the web, on the left side, there's a wallet app and card item or a menu item.
[00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:10.880]   And then you can just say, "Hey, order it."
[00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:14.880]   So up to now, I've had a single credit card associated with my Google wallet.
[00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:18.800]   I can have now many credit cards associated and have it all work with that.
[00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:19.800]   Yeah.
[00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:20.800]   Yeah.
[00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:21.800]   Yeah.
[00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:22.800]   Yeah.
[00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:24.560]   You can get to such a bank account or credit cards.
[00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:26.880]   So that's been available for a while.
[00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:27.880]   Yeah.
[00:23:27.880 --> 00:23:29.320]   And my T-Mobile account is also hooked up.
[00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:30.480]   I've got mobile carrier billing.
[00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:33.440]   I've got a couple of credit cards.
[00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:34.440]   Let's see.
[00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:35.440]   Add a payment method.
[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:36.440]   Yeah.
[00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:37.440]   And you can also add a bank account.
[00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:41.640]   So in a lot of ways, yeah, you can hook up several of your cards.
[00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:44.720]   So this is a little bit like coin without the swipe.
[00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:45.720]   Yeah.
[00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:53.440]   Well, it's like it's like coin except it's not a crazy device that anyone's going to say,
[00:23:53.440 --> 00:23:54.440]   "What the heck is this?"
[00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:56.000]   Actually, it looks like a card.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.480]   And it's just a simple plastic card.
[00:23:57.480 --> 00:23:59.640]   It's not a fancy device.
[00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:00.640]   Well, maybe someday.
[00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:03.280]   They must be rolling it out because it's nowhere in my wallet.
[00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:06.120]   It doesn't have a chip and pin, does it?
[00:24:06.120 --> 00:24:10.040]   No, of course not.
[00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:14.600]   Why did chip and pin, chip and pin which is used everywhere outside the US is a smart
[00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:15.600]   card technology.
[00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:18.360]   So you have an identifying chip in the credit card.
[00:24:18.360 --> 00:24:22.280]   And then instead of swiping it, they tap it, right?
[00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:23.280]   Am I right, Kevin?
[00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:24.280]   Yeah.
[00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:28.200]   And then you enter, you're required to enter a four digit pin to verify.
[00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:30.560]   And that's used widely outside the US.
[00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:31.560]   It's used everywhere.
[00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:35.520]   In fact, when you're outside the US, try to use one of the non-chip and pin credit cards.
[00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:37.280]   They look often look a scat set.
[00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:39.840]   So you get a chip like that on it.
[00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:44.480]   But also, the other thing I've got this card, which is one of my UK ones, is it's also got
[00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:46.360]   a little Wi-Fi symbol.
[00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:48.160]   Looks like a Wi-Fi symbol if you see that.
[00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:49.160]   Which is the Tats of Mac.
[00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:50.160]   We don't have video.
[00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:55.800]   You don't have my video, though.
[00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:56.800]   I'm seeing a preview of it.
[00:24:56.800 --> 00:24:59.680]   Wallet app and card.
[00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:00.840]   So anyway, I see it.
[00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:02.080]   So you have to go to the web, Gina.
[00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:03.080]   I was using the app.
[00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:04.080]   Yeah.
[00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:05.080]   I'm sorry.
[00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:06.080]   I was using the app.
[00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:07.520]   So I'm going to get my card now.
[00:25:07.520 --> 00:25:08.520]   Yeah.
[00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:11.960]   So right on the web, sorry, with that on the web, while it app and card, then you can
[00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:13.160]   order it from there.
[00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:16.160]   Good.
[00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:20.200]   And then last little bit of newness.
[00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:25.240]   Nexus 5, bumper cases and the wireless charger launched in the Google Play Store.
[00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:31.360]   So if you want a case, you want a wireless charger, the wireless charger is a little
[00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:32.600]   strange looking.
[00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:36.200]   It's certainly not as nice as the half, the sliced--
[00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:40.160]   The puck didn't work, though.
[00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:43.640]   My Nexus 4 slid off of it every time.
[00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:44.640]   Yeah.
[00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:46.680]   So apparently this is flat, so it's not going to happen.
[00:25:46.680 --> 00:25:50.480]   And there's magnets in both the Nexus 5 and the charger.
[00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:52.760]   So it will just go and line up and lock in.
[00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:53.760]   Which is kind of key.
[00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:54.760]   Yeah.
[00:25:54.760 --> 00:26:00.440]   And it works with the Nexus-- the 2013 Nexus 7, the Nexus 4, and the Nexus 5.
[00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:01.440]   Cool.
[00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:02.440]   Yeah.
[00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:07.880]   And the bumper cases are just, you know, rubber.
[00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:09.920]   Baby buggy bumpers.
[00:26:09.920 --> 00:26:10.920]   Bumpers, yeah, there.
[00:26:10.920 --> 00:26:11.920]   And they're 35 bucks.
[00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:12.920]   Neat.
[00:26:12.920 --> 00:26:17.960]   And they come in a few different colors, red, yellow, gray, black.
[00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:19.840]   And now I was surprised actually they call these bumper cases.
[00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:23.080]   I thought bumpers were just the outside band.
[00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:25.760]   But this is a full back case as well.
[00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:29.200]   That's so Apple to think of that as a bumper.
[00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:32.120]   Anything that protects you against bumps is a bumper.
[00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:33.120]   Only--
[00:26:33.120 --> 00:26:34.120]   Okay.
[00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:35.120]   No, I agree with you.
[00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:37.200]   I'd consider a bumper case to be a rim all the way around.
[00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:39.120]   Yeah, that's what I was expecting to see.
[00:26:39.120 --> 00:26:40.120]   But this is a full--
[00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:41.120]   Such as a case.
[00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:42.120]   Yeah.
[00:26:42.120 --> 00:26:43.120]   Right.
[00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:44.120]   Right.
[00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:45.120]   It's just a case, exactly.
[00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:46.520]   That's all I got for the changelog.
[00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:49.520]   And that's the Google changelog.
[00:26:49.520 --> 00:26:54.960]   I'm more-- sorry, ordering my credit card.
[00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:55.960]   Do it.
[00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:56.960]   Order it up.
[00:26:56.960 --> 00:26:57.960]   I'm such snuckering.
[00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:01.560]   I'm trying to order a bumper case, but I can actually find it in the school.
[00:27:01.560 --> 00:27:02.560]   Oh.
[00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:03.560]   Oh.
[00:27:03.560 --> 00:27:08.400]   It looks like it's not yet available according to somebody in the chat room.
[00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:12.040]   Because I've got the-- I wouldn't drop this Nexus 5 once and, you know, I just asked them
[00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:15.040]   to travel with the--
[00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:16.040]   I just dropped the link in the chat.
[00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:18.120]   They're changing the UI on this Nexus site.
[00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:21.200]   And they used to be a thingsane fire bumper not available.
[00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:23.920]   Now there isn't a thingsane that I can find.
[00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:27.160]   But it's like-- they got strange, scourly crap-half English ones.
[00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:29.160]   I can't-- where it is.
[00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:31.160]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:32.160]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:27:32.160 --> 00:27:33.680]   Oh, the pitter-patter of the rain.
[00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:35.600]   Pitter-patter of the rain.
[00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:36.600]   Yes.
[00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:38.680]   I'm quite sure why I've lost video.
[00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:41.800]   I'm wondering if it is just because the rain is absorbing all the Wi-Fi.
[00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:43.880]   The rain-- does really?
[00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:44.880]   Is that how that works?
[00:27:44.880 --> 00:27:45.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:27:45.880 --> 00:27:49.760]   The original Wi-Fi frequency is where water molecules are.
[00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:51.720]   That's why we rarely use it in the first place.
[00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:52.240]   Because--
[00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:52.720]   Wait a minute.
[00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:54.120]   Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:57.920]   You're saying 2.4 gigahertz is where water molecules are?
[00:27:57.920 --> 00:27:58.320]   Yeah.
[00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:02.240]   It's the same frequency that microwaves you use to excite things.
[00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:05.080]   That's why-- because it resonates at that frequency.
[00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:05.480]   Yeah.
[00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:07.720]   Water molecules resonated at that frequency.
[00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:08.520]   So--
[00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:10.440]   So the government was like, sure, you can have that.
[00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:12.080]   Nobody else wants it.
[00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:17.320]   So if I were in a giant vat of water right now,
[00:28:17.320 --> 00:28:21.000]   no Wi-Fi would penetrate it?
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.600]   Yeah.
[00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:25.240]   And that's why we can't see him because he's in a--
[00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:27.280]   I'm bigger hurts, because of the rainstorm.
[00:28:27.280 --> 00:28:29.640]   But I'm not-- you know, I said that the rain is behind me,
[00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:31.800]   so that seems wrong.
[00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:33.440]   I hear a lot of water around you.
[00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:34.960]   Are you taking a shower?
[00:28:34.960 --> 00:28:36.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:40.440]   I mean, I'm in the garden under my canopy with rain pooling.
[00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:43.480]   No, I've still got 50 dB of water here.
[00:28:43.480 --> 00:28:45.000]   So I think it's just like--
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.920]   It should have changed to 5 gigahertz.
[00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:50.560]   I have-- I learned something every time I talk to Kevin
[00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:52.280]   works.
[00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:54.760]   Of course, that's why it's 2.4 gigahertz.
[00:28:54.760 --> 00:28:58.080]   It's why it's the microwave frequency in microwave ovens,
[00:28:58.080 --> 00:28:59.600]   because it excites water molecules,
[00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:01.880]   because it resonates with them, because it's at the same--
[00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:07.720]   but in the same frequency as the water-- wow.
[00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:11.480]   How do I tell them that to use 5 gigahertz and not the other?
[00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:15.080]   If you have 5 gigahertz on your access point,
[00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:19.200]   if that's turned on, you should see both the standard one
[00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:21.840]   and one-- oh, unless you haven't named it separately.
[00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:23.160]   No, I see.
[00:29:23.160 --> 00:29:24.000]   I see it.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:24.500]   I see it.
[00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:26.400]   I should see it.
[00:29:26.400 --> 00:29:28.120]   No, we name ours separately here,
[00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:32.600]   because Apple has a problem switching between 5 gigahertz
[00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:33.160]   and 1.
[00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:35.720]   I remember going into my airport extrements
[00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:37.720]   and saying, yes, please name the 5 gigahertz--
[00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:39.960]   dash 5 gigahertz.
[00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:43.640]   So maybe that's what you need to do.
[00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:47.480]   So it's public because they thought 2.4 gigahertz.
[00:29:47.480 --> 00:29:50.280]   It wouldn't-- nobody'd want it, because of the rain.
[00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:54.480]   Wow.
[00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:55.440]   OK.
[00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:57.480]   Apparently, Andy in Germany says, as a ham,
[00:29:57.480 --> 00:29:59.000]   I should have known that.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   It wasn't in the test.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.400]   It's going to reboot my network, isn't it?
[00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:04.640]   Yeah, no, maybe yes.
[00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:06.440]   But if it does, we'll call you right back.
[00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:09.400]   OK, I will do this in the same answer as the 5 gigahertz.
[00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:11.960]   Even if the rain itself does not cause major propagation
[00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:14.600]   problems, it will collect on the leaves of trees,
[00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:18.800]   says ScooterX, and produce attenuation until it evaporates.
[00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:22.840]   You are now in the Wi-Fi free zone.
[00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:25.680]   Wow.
[00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:27.480]   And there he goes.
[00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:29.760]   CyanogenMod has an app.
[00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:30.920]   We talked about this last week.
[00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:32.200]   Have you tried it yet, Gene?
[00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:33.160]   Have you?
[00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:34.840]   Because apparently, and I didn't understand that,
[00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:37.320]   not only does it change your firmware,
[00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:38.560]   it routes the phone for you.
[00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:40.240]   You just put it on there and--
[00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:41.360]   you're done.
[00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:44.640]   Yeah, no, I haven't tried it, because the desktop component
[00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:45.920]   was Windows only, and I just don't--
[00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:46.420]   That's right.
[00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:46.920]   We talked about it.
[00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:49.560]   Windows machine to try it out with.
[00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:52.760]   But yeah, so it routes your device.
[00:30:52.760 --> 00:30:53.840]   I didn't realize it did.
[00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:57.040]   It's a one-click, one-stop shop.
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:31:01.320]   But you still have to connect your thing to the computer
[00:31:01.320 --> 00:31:03.360]   and install the thing on the desktop.
[00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:04.440]   I mean, I don't mean to be--
[00:31:04.440 --> 00:31:06.680]   I understand that it's a hard problem from a developer
[00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:08.200]   perspective, but from a user perspective,
[00:31:08.200 --> 00:31:09.960]   it's still pretty nerdy.
[00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:10.960]   Yeah.
[00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:14.040]   But good great that you can do it.
[00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:15.960]   I think CyanogenMod, the company,
[00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:18.920]   I think that their greatest challenge is going to make.
[00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:22.520]   Is going to be making these types of things
[00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:24.160]   consumer-friendly.
[00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:25.240]   And they're getting there.
[00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:26.160]   This is a big step, right?
[00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:29.560]   But it's not-- it's still getting a little bit better.
[00:31:29.560 --> 00:31:31.640]   And yeah, I just didn't have access to a Windows machine
[00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:33.320]   to give it a try.
[00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:36.880]   We were talking before the show began about Coin,
[00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:39.120]   speaking of this Google Wallet card.
[00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:41.120]   I do have to think that the Google Wallet card is somewhat
[00:31:41.120 --> 00:31:42.400]   in response to Coin.
[00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:46.280]   Coin is a Y-combinator startup that on November 14th
[00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:51.480]   managed to grab the imagination of every tech blog, journal,
[00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:54.400]   magazine, and newspaper in the entire country
[00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:58.600]   with an amazingly well-orchestrated PR campaign.
[00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:02.240]   The idea, if you watch the video on the Coin website, which I
[00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:08.400]   think is onlycoin.com, is one card to rule them all.
[00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:12.400]   You get a little coin swiper, which is actually what the company
[00:32:12.400 --> 00:32:14.640]   originally was in Y-combinator for.
[00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:19.440]   Was this Arduino low-energy Bluetooth swiper?
[00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:21.080]   You put that on your phone.
[00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:23.720]   I think it doesn't say, but I would guess iOS only.
[00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:26.840]   That's what their original product was for.
[00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:30.040]   You swipe all your credit cards as many as you want.
[00:32:30.040 --> 00:32:33.120]   And then, somehow, magically, you get it
[00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:36.800]   into this black coin card, which has a little--
[00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:37.240]   there you go.
[00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:38.360]   There's the black coin card.
[00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:40.360]   It has a little electro-illuminescent display,
[00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:45.560]   or maybe it's a paper E-ink display on the back of it.
[00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:49.520]   And you can swipe any of your--
[00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:51.680]   you can have up to eight cards on the front.
[00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:53.600]   Swipe any of your eight cards.
[00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:54.280]   Now--
[00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:55.800]   And then you can lose them all at once.
[00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:56.400]   You can lose them.
[00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:59.440]   It makes it easier to lose them, which is good.
[00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:01.840]   It does seem to solve a problem, which isn't a big problem.
[00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:04.960]   But I guess if you have lots of loyalty cards and so forth--
[00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:09.760]   because it does work with loyalty cards, that's good.
[00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:12.880]   I would be a little slow to run to their website
[00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:14.280]   and give them $55.
[00:33:14.280 --> 00:33:15.440]   That's what they're asking me saying.
[00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:19.280]   But that's only half what it's going to cost sometime next year
[00:33:19.280 --> 00:33:20.840]   when we offer this product.
[00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:23.200]   You know, if it really is that good and you really do need it,
[00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:29.840]   I would say, let's just wait until it comes out and pay the $100.
[00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:31.440]   And who's to say it won't come out?
[00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:32.640]   But there are lots of questions.
[00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:35.440]   Coin has responded to some criticism.
[00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:37.720]   Among other things, people were worried
[00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:42.600]   about how secure the data was stored in the card in the app.
[00:33:42.600 --> 00:33:46.320]   How can a coin owner use the device as a card skimmer
[00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:48.360]   and secretly swipe other people's cards?
[00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:50.520]   Hey, Kevin, let me just take a look at your watch.
[00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:51.520]   Shh.
[00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:53.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:55.600]   Father Rob will say that as soon as he gets his coin,
[00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:58.160]   everybody gets what their cards will be in his coin.
[00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:00.440]   All it's a McCard skimmer.
[00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:05.080]   And also, the issue is, well, what happens if your phone runs out
[00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:05.560]   of battery?
[00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:07.040]   It doesn't work anymore.
[00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:10.840]   And will merchants look at this strange device and say, oh, yeah,
[00:34:10.840 --> 00:34:12.560]   no problem.
[00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:14.560]   Take that $1,000 worth of merchandise.
[00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:19.280]   I'm sure whatever you're doing to my card machine is normal.
[00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:21.400]   Well, it doesn't have chip in pin.
[00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:23.120]   It doesn't have time to pay.
[00:34:23.120 --> 00:34:23.440]   Right.
[00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:27.000]   So it will only work in the US, where we don't yet
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:29.640]   have chipped cards.
[00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:30.880]   You do, but they don't have the chips then work.
[00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:33.040]   I got issued a chip card by World's Fargo.
[00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:34.720]   And I took it to the UK.
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:37.440]   It's to get you used to the idea of having a chip.
[00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:38.760]   It doesn't actually do anything.
[00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:39.600]   It's a pretend chip.
[00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:41.160]   It's a pretend chip.
[00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:43.800]   But this is my UK card, which I'm holding upside down.
[00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:44.240]   Yeah.
[00:34:44.240 --> 00:34:46.440]   And you see, there's a little IC on the front of it.
[00:34:46.440 --> 00:34:47.000]   Yeah.
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:47.760]   Little gold chip.
[00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:50.360]   There's also a little thing that looks like a Wi-Fi symbol.
[00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:50.880]   What's that?
[00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:52.040]   Is that tap and pay?
[00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:52.720]   It's tap and pay.
[00:34:52.720 --> 00:34:54.000]   Oh, that's nice.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:58.840]   So tap and pay is more widespread in the UK.
[00:34:58.840 --> 00:34:59.960]   See, I love tap and pay.
[00:34:59.960 --> 00:35:02.920]   And in theory, we can do that with NFC on our phones, right?
[00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:03.960]   No, that works now.
[00:35:03.960 --> 00:35:06.200]   I mean, I've used the Google Wallet for that.
[00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:09.960]   And a lot of retailers in the US have tap and pay already.
[00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:13.200]   Starbucks, Peet, Macy's.
[00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:15.560]   You just look for the little Wi-Fi symbol on the thing
[00:35:15.560 --> 00:35:17.840]   by the desk and then you can tap it.
[00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:19.880]   It often confuses the person trying to sell you things
[00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:21.640]   when you do that.
[00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:22.480]   I used to--
[00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:23.880]   And they were like, what just happened?
[00:35:23.880 --> 00:35:25.720]   You just tap to the-- what?
[00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:26.760]   What?
[00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:28.240]   So maybe this card, maybe the fact
[00:35:28.240 --> 00:35:32.360]   that this black cacker looking card, maybe nobody's
[00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:33.520]   going to even look at it.
[00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:34.280]   Oh, it worked.
[00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:35.880]   My machine liked it, so I'm happy.
[00:35:35.880 --> 00:35:36.280]   Go.
[00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:37.120]   Take.
[00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:37.880]   Enjoy.
[00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:39.480]   But I mean, the other trouble with these things
[00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:42.440]   is that they don't always get the affordance right.
[00:35:42.440 --> 00:35:45.000]   And this is-- so the problem with tap and pay
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:48.240]   is it's actually very hard to tip.
[00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:51.000]   And this is something that Swipe got right on the merchant side.
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:54.280]   So you swipe your card into the Swipe machine
[00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:57.000]   and then they give you the iPad and you can click to tip
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:58.360]   and decide what the tip is.
[00:35:58.360 --> 00:36:00.240]   Whereas if you've got tap and pay, you can't do that.
[00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:02.720]   So you have to use in cash, which is kind of weird.
[00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:05.080]   And it's no different from you giving the credit card
[00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:06.360]   and they swipe it and don't you think you're
[00:36:06.360 --> 00:36:08.040]   assigned to you can't put the tip in.
[00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:08.360]   But it's--
[00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:09.800]   I love to pay with Square.
[00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:11.840]   I wish more people use it because that solves it.
[00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:13.960]   Because they actually show you what the cost was.
[00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:15.560]   And they say, add a tip.
[00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:18.280]   And there's even a button, a convenient dollar tip button.
[00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:19.120]   You just go, yeah.
[00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:22.160]   I mean, that's something Google could fix in the wallet app
[00:36:22.160 --> 00:36:23.520]   when you're using the phone.
[00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:24.160]   Right.
[00:36:24.160 --> 00:36:25.480]   But at the moment, it doesn't do that.
[00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:27.160]   So if I buy coffee with it, I then
[00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:29.560]   still got to find cash to tip them, which is kind of--
[00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:31.760]   More not tip them at all because really, after all,
[00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:34.240]   how much have they done for you?
[00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:36.240]   Well, I like the people who make coffee with me
[00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:37.320]   at the very beginning.
[00:36:37.320 --> 00:36:40.240]   Honestly, you just paid $7 for that frappuccino latte,
[00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:41.600]   latte, latte.
[00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:43.520]   And the guy all he did was he went over and said,
[00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:45.400]   cappuccino, please.
[00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:46.400]   And then he gave you a--
[00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:47.440]   He didn't even give you the mug.
[00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:49.320]   Some other guy did that.
[00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:53.240]   So really, come on, stop tipping.
[00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:55.400]   I'm sorry, I'm just kidding.
[00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:57.720]   As somebody who works in the food service industry for most
[00:36:57.720 --> 00:37:01.720]   of my young adult life, please, I tip very well.
[00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:02.160]   I--
[00:37:02.160 --> 00:37:06.000]   It's just so funny when I go in the UK and try and tip people.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.080]   And they're very surprised and confused by how it is.
[00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:09.320]   Because I'm the habit of it now.
[00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:11.680]   It surprises and confuses us Americans when we travel.
[00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:13.080]   And people say, what, tip?
[00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:14.520]   What's that?
[00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:16.000]   You gave me too much money.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:17.280]   I had that in a pub.
[00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:18.520]   You left a change on the bar.
[00:37:18.520 --> 00:37:19.040]   Right.
[00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:21.080]   They come running after you.
[00:37:21.080 --> 00:37:21.920]   Excuse me, sir.
[00:37:21.920 --> 00:37:26.280]   That's so weird.
[00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:29.960]   So Coin today announced some changes
[00:37:29.960 --> 00:37:31.400]   in response to these criticisms.
[00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:34.280]   The company is going to add a button to the coin card
[00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:38.120]   so users can reactivate it even if their phone is dead.
[00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:41.320]   You will be able to tap a button in a Morse code-like fashion.
[00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:42.760]   I don't know what that means.
[00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:44.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:45.840]   In a Morse code.
[00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:47.560]   [SINGING]
[00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:49.840]   I have no-- what does that even--
[00:37:49.840 --> 00:37:51.800]   Coin will also feature a system that shows you
[00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:53.920]   how many times your card is being swiped
[00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:57.120]   and tell you if someone is using it when it isn't near you.
[00:37:57.120 --> 00:38:00.280]   Does not address any of the concerns, I think I've mentioned.
[00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:04.360]   Finally, the device will also lock on a single card.
[00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:06.720]   Then this is good, so the waiter can't just
[00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:08.240]   switch your payment method.
[00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:08.920]   This was a concern.
[00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:10.480]   People would hear, here's my coin card.
[00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:11.960]   And she could scroll through and say,
[00:38:11.960 --> 00:38:14.720]   yeah, I'm going to have an MX pay today.
[00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:17.880]   So they're going to apparently give you a lock.
[00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:22.000]   Coin CEO and founder Konoszik Parashar
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:28.040]   said these changes will come down the road in a future
[00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:30.120]   prototype of the product.
[00:38:30.120 --> 00:38:31.800]   Coin, you can pay them now.
[00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:32.960]   And they'll take your money gladly.
[00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:36.800]   But don't expect it till summer 2014.
[00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:38.440]   It's a crowdfunding campaign.
[00:38:38.440 --> 00:38:40.800]   Even though it doesn't look like it, it's a crowdfunding campaign.
[00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:43.360]   They're asking people to pre-order
[00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:45.040]   to help-- they're trying to raise money
[00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:47.480]   to get this into production.
[00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:49.680]   Parashar didn't say one of the things we wanted
[00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:51.560]   from our launch was feedback, but we
[00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:52.800]   didn't expect to get so much.
[00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:56.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:38:56.840 --> 00:38:59.680]   Well, Parashar said he doesn't find the criticism unfair.
[00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:02.280]   I'm reading this from CNN money.
[00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:03.760]   He doesn't find the criticism unfair,
[00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:05.440]   but he did complain about the vehemence
[00:39:05.440 --> 00:39:07.280]   of some of the critiques.
[00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:09.200]   Everyone forgets this thing is six months old.
[00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:11.520]   It takes time to put it together fully.
[00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:14.160]   Of course, and my suggestion is no one
[00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:16.640]   give him any money until he has something
[00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:17.960]   to give you in return.
[00:39:17.960 --> 00:39:19.720]   They don't even ask for your address.
[00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:22.040]   They just take your money and say thank you.
[00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:24.080]   Goodbye.
[00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:27.120]   Parashar said he hasn't slept since Coin launched its campaign
[00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:30.440]   last week, was mostly surprised by the concerns
[00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:31.840]   about security and fraud.
[00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:34.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:35.960]   That does not encourage me at all.
[00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:37.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:39.280]   That's not good.
[00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:42.440]   And the FAQ, they say that they don't take addresses
[00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:44.120]   because they're shipping in the summer,
[00:39:44.120 --> 00:39:46.280]   and you could move between now and then.
[00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:49.200]   So OK.
[00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:50.640]   And that's common in Kickstarter, right?
[00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:51.920]   When you back something, you have to--
[00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:53.760]   But I have to say, this is not a Kickstarter.
[00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:55.600]   What I used is my credit card does take my address
[00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:56.880]   because they use for verification.
[00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:57.800]   So there's something--
[00:39:57.800 --> 00:39:59.200]   It's really odd.
[00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:00.520]   And this is not a Kickstarter.
[00:40:00.520 --> 00:40:02.600]   They chose to do this on their own website,
[00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:04.760]   which eliminates a lot of the protections
[00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:08.080]   Kickstarter has implemented over the last few months
[00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:10.000]   in response to some of the problems on Kickstarter.
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:11.840]   For instance, they don't let you show a video that
[00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:15.720]   is a raw, that is a non-existing prototype, which apparently
[00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:17.880]   is what we're seeing on the coin video.
[00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:23.280]   They don't allow-- they require that you talk about what
[00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:25.280]   could go wrong in the posting.
[00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:27.200]   There's none of that on the coin site.
[00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:31.120]   And they don't-- they tell you how much money they've raised
[00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:33.680]   to date, and they don't generally fund--
[00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:34.880]   they don't take money out of your card
[00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:36.680]   until they've met their funding goal.
[00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:38.840]   There is no funding goal on the coin site.
[00:40:38.840 --> 00:40:40.480]   They don't tell you how much money they've raised,
[00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:42.120]   and they take your card immediately.
[00:40:42.120 --> 00:40:44.400]   They take your cash immediately.
[00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:46.880]   Now, the last issue, which is to me a big issue,
[00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:48.480]   is how are you going to use this?
[00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:50.920]   What emergency is going to do?
[00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:53.080]   Parashar told CNN money that coin
[00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:54.520]   wasn't planning to go out of their way
[00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:56.520]   to educate the merchant world about it
[00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:59.360]   because we're focused on the consumer-cusside.
[00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:01.560]   But he says, now he'll talk with credit card companies
[00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:03.760]   and merchants much faster than I anticipated.
[00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:11.640]   Coin doesn't currently support Chip and Pin, which
[00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:13.560]   is known as EMV, but the company plans
[00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:16.720]   to add that capability in future versions.
[00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:20.400]   Might just be the prudent, the intelligent thing to do,
[00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:22.360]   unless you just really love the idea so much.
[00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:24.520]   You just want to give them money.
[00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:26.480]   Would be to wait and see.
[00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:29.880]   And when maybe there'll be even a better one,
[00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:34.400]   coin 0.2, 2.0, you know?
[00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:36.080]   Also, is it really that much of a trouble
[00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:37.480]   to carry all those credit cards?
[00:41:37.480 --> 00:41:40.120]   I don't find it that difficult.
[00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:44.800]   But I have to admit, I have a little target loyalty card.
[00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:46.280]   I don't carry that around.
[00:41:46.280 --> 00:41:47.360]   I have a lot of loyalty cards.
[00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:48.680]   I don't carry them.
[00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:50.120]   And every time I go to the movie theater,
[00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:51.640]   the movie theater now is a loyalty card.
[00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:54.880]   I never remember to bring my loyalty card and get my points.
[00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:57.320]   So maybe this would be good.
[00:41:57.320 --> 00:42:01.400]   But I did order right away sight unseen, the Google card.
[00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:02.920]   Yeah, well, but that was free.
[00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:05.720]   And that's an account that you're already using, right?
[00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:08.680]   Use Google Wallet to buy from the Play Store, at least.
[00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:09.920]   Right.
[00:42:09.920 --> 00:42:13.920]   And I have two main credit cards in the wallet.
[00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:16.320]   So it'll be nice.
[00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:18.480]   And there's no concern that the retailer is going to say,
[00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:19.880]   like, what is this thing?
[00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:23.360]   It's going to look like a plastic credit card.
[00:42:23.360 --> 00:42:24.880]   Right.
[00:42:24.880 --> 00:42:26.640]   That's a Google on it, which, you know,
[00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:28.000]   it's a Google's a thing.
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:29.280]   Yeah.
[00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:31.080]   And I like Google.
[00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:39.480]   Somebody said we're raining on coins, by literally.
[00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:41.000]   Well, going to have a big parade.
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:41.800]   I'll have a rain for you here.
[00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:52.040]   Motorola is shipping Android 4.4 KitKat for its Moto X,
[00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:55.040]   but only if you're on Verizon.
[00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:57.400]   Weird, weird, weird.
[00:42:57.400 --> 00:42:59.600]   OK.
[00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:03.720]   That's got to be the carriers are holding it back, right?
[00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:05.200]   Do you have any insight on that, Kevin?
[00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:08.120]   What does it take to push an update?
[00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:12.360]   If you're the hardware manufacturer and you have an update,
[00:43:12.360 --> 00:43:15.240]   or you're the Android-- you know, you have an Android update,
[00:43:15.240 --> 00:43:17.760]   Google's pushed to you or something.
[00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:21.240]   The ultimate gatekeeper is, of course, the carrier.
[00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:21.640]   Yeah.
[00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:24.200]   It's going to go over their network, in most cases.
[00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:29.360]   I guess that's why Samsung uses keys, this home network-based
[00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:31.240]   connected to your computer version,
[00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:33.040]   because at least they can bypass the carrier,
[00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:35.560]   or maybe that's because they're so global.
[00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:37.400]   It sounds-- if only Verizon has it,
[00:43:37.400 --> 00:43:39.600]   it sounds like the other carriers in the US
[00:43:39.600 --> 00:43:41.400]   have yet approved to approve it, right?
[00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:45.720]   Yeah, it's a combination of things.
[00:43:45.720 --> 00:43:47.840]   I think it depends on what they're changing,
[00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:49.320]   what who needs to approve what.
[00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:51.120]   But yeah, do an over-the-air that
[00:43:51.120 --> 00:43:54.360]   they need to go through the carrier as well as the manufacturer.
[00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:56.400]   So there's a lot of coordination problems going on there.
[00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:58.560]   And it's one of the things that Apple bypassed with their stuff
[00:43:58.560 --> 00:44:02.320]   by saying, "No, we'll just ruin it straight from us to the end device."
[00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:05.400]   And that's-- we'll make it our problem, what yours.
[00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:10.360]   And that's the condition of us giving you iPhone,
[00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:11.800]   is that it's all the same.
[00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:14.320]   And the other piece is the reason this takes time
[00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:18.520]   is that all the carriers mess with the Android versions as well.
[00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:20.840]   So they've got a bit of their own binary, too.
[00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:23.080]   So you've got to-- so you've got to-- you know, they'll
[00:44:23.080 --> 00:44:25.040]   reach the AOSP, then they've got to port it
[00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:26.720]   for the particular device, and the carrier's
[00:44:26.720 --> 00:44:29.880]   got to port it for their set of whatever else they install, too.
[00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:32.800]   So you've basically got three QA departments
[00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:35.000]   to go through, and one of them, which is a telco,
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:38.440]   and they have very big and slow QA departments.
[00:44:38.440 --> 00:44:39.800]   Speaking of iOS--
[00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:42.320]   I haven't had an update for the Nexus 7 yet, which is--
[00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:43.280]   But that passes me.
[00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:44.680]   This is what's weird.
[00:44:44.680 --> 00:44:45.200]   Yeah.
[00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:46.360]   That's what's weird about it, right?
[00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:50.000]   This is happening on Verizon before Nexus devices.
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:54.480]   And before my Google Play Edition device, which is--
[00:44:54.480 --> 00:44:54.840]   Yeah.
[00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:56.040]   --just strange.
[00:44:56.040 --> 00:44:58.520]   And apparently, apparently, the update's been pushed to Google,
[00:44:58.520 --> 00:44:59.800]   and Google just hasn't rolled it out yet.
[00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:01.600]   They said it was supposed to be November 15 for the Google
[00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:04.960]   Play Edition HTC One, and I have not gotten it yet.
[00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:07.600]   My system is up to date.
[00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:10.480]   Android lies to me.
[00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:13.400]   Not up to date.
[00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:15.520]   Not up to date.
[00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:16.680]   Yeah.
[00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:19.280]   Are you one of those people that presses refresh, refresh,
[00:45:19.280 --> 00:45:20.280]   refresh?
[00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:22.080]   No, I'm busy.
[00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:23.560]   I mean, I just did it just now.
[00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:25.760]   It's just my system's up to date.
[00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:28.040]   Not since I had the baby ID that less.
[00:45:28.040 --> 00:45:28.400]   Yeah.
[00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:29.680]   But once in a while.
[00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:31.480]   Yeah.
[00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:32.880]   You've got other things to do.
[00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:35.160]   I used to have more time to refresh my system update
[00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:36.160]   panel.
[00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:36.920]   That's fresh.
[00:45:36.920 --> 00:45:41.200]   Android powers, according to Engadget 4 out of every five
[00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:42.760]   smartphones in the world.
[00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:46.040]   80% market shares just mind-boggling.
[00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:47.520]   But remember, that's not in the US.
[00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:49.600]   That's globally.
[00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:51.520]   Actually, this comes from Gartner Group.
[00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:57.200]   And it's global because of China, where you can't--
[00:45:57.200 --> 00:45:59.520]   I still don't think you can legally buy an iPhone.
[00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:01.200]   I think that--
[00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:02.120]   is that right or no?
[00:46:02.120 --> 00:46:04.400]   No, you can, but it's not on the big carrier.
[00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:07.720]   It's on some of the little carriers.
[00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:11.400]   So by the way, if you want to get Kit Kat on a Moto X,
[00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:15.480]   apparently Scooter X is saying you can get one on Amazon,
[00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:19.840]   a Verizon Moto X for one penny right now,
[00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:21.200]   for upgrades into the lines.
[00:46:21.200 --> 00:46:21.640]   So it's contracts.
[00:46:21.640 --> 00:46:23.400]   Yeah, well, oh, hey.
[00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:24.200]   Yeah, come on.
[00:46:24.200 --> 00:46:25.000]   This is America.
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:25.480]   Of course.
[00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:27.600]   Yeah.
[00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:28.160]   One penny.
[00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:30.840]   And we own you for the next two years of your life.
[00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:32.680]   And one penny in two years of your life.
[00:46:32.680 --> 00:46:33.200]   Yeah.
[00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:35.440]   We just like--
[00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:37.480]   B. Jeff and a channel, Jeff, and say,
[00:46:37.480 --> 00:46:40.200]   I wouldn't trust Verizon to get it right in the first place.
[00:46:40.200 --> 00:46:42.680]   So you're still sitting there trying to get them to connect.
[00:46:42.680 --> 00:46:43.280]   But yeah.
[00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:44.520]   Yeah.
[00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:45.520]   So--
[00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:46.880]   Oh, so--
[00:46:46.880 --> 00:46:49.360]   I mean, one thing I have noticed over the next five
[00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:51.880]   is that it has trouble getting onto Wi-Fi.
[00:46:51.880 --> 00:46:52.680]   Really?
[00:46:52.680 --> 00:46:57.640]   And yeah, if it's on Wi-Fi, I go out and come back.
[00:46:57.640 --> 00:46:59.040]   It won't kick to Wi-Fi again.
[00:46:59.040 --> 00:47:01.680]   And you have to airplane mode it off and I get it.
[00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:02.680]   Then it finds it.
[00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:03.080]   So that's--
[00:47:03.080 --> 00:47:03.680]   So I've not noticed that.
[00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:06.040]   But I mean, it may--
[00:47:06.040 --> 00:47:08.320]   I rarely leave home with it.
[00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:08.800]   Right.
[00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:11.720]   So it's always on the same one.
[00:47:11.720 --> 00:47:12.840]   No, it's just something I noticed.
[00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:15.160]   No, it looked up in the forums and there were various people
[00:47:15.160 --> 00:47:16.840]   saying, oh, try to debug it.
[00:47:16.840 --> 00:47:18.640]   So there may be something like that going on,
[00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:20.320]   but maybe it's been like Google's sitting on the update
[00:47:20.320 --> 00:47:21.160]   for the other devices.
[00:47:21.160 --> 00:47:21.640]   Right.
[00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:23.880]   Because if you break the Wi-Fi on the Nexus 7,
[00:47:23.880 --> 00:47:26.760]   you're kind of in trouble.
[00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:27.240]   Yeah.
[00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:28.160]   You've got nothing.
[00:47:28.160 --> 00:47:28.720]   I got nothing.
[00:47:28.720 --> 00:47:30.280]   I was there.
[00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:33.960]   Well, you could always connect the vera-- oh, no, never mind.
[00:47:33.960 --> 00:47:36.640]   Google, this will be of interest to the glass holes
[00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:37.320]   in the audience.
[00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:38.720]   And I know, Gina, you're interested,
[00:47:38.720 --> 00:47:40.920]   it has both a glass hole and a developer.
[00:47:40.920 --> 00:47:45.680]   There is a glass SDK and an app development kit.
[00:47:45.680 --> 00:47:48.440]   Google has showed a little bit of this.
[00:47:48.440 --> 00:47:49.840]   Was it today?
[00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:51.000]   It was a couple of things ago.
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:54.280]   Did they hackathon, hack event, classware, hack event?
[00:47:54.280 --> 00:47:57.160]   Yeah, this is like the GDK is an actual development kit.
[00:47:57.160 --> 00:48:01.640]   As opposed to the mirror API, which is sort of a REST API,
[00:48:01.640 --> 00:48:05.440]   the GDK exposes things like voice commands and location
[00:48:05.440 --> 00:48:08.840]   data and gestures on the glass touchpad.
[00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:12.200]   So in theory-- and I think this will happen-- developers
[00:48:12.200 --> 00:48:15.800]   will be able to make sort of more native apps for a glass,
[00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:16.920]   which is exciting.
[00:48:16.920 --> 00:48:19.160]   It makes a lot of sense that they're releasing this now
[00:48:19.160 --> 00:48:22.240]   before Glass comes out for consumers.
[00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:24.800]   And yeah, glassware, glassware, which
[00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:26.720]   is what apps for Glass are called,
[00:48:26.720 --> 00:48:28.440]   are kind of getting a big push.
[00:48:28.440 --> 00:48:30.440]   Google's really pushing on them right now.
[00:48:30.440 --> 00:48:33.160]   Did you get your Glass 2.0 or something?
[00:48:33.160 --> 00:48:35.240]   Isn't there a kit that you're supposed to get?
[00:48:35.240 --> 00:48:36.120]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:48:36.120 --> 00:48:37.040]   I was supposed to get--
[00:48:37.040 --> 00:48:38.720]   we're supposed to get the opportunity
[00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:41.680]   to swap in our current Glass for a new Glass, right?
[00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:42.640]   I haven't gotten it.
[00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:45.040]   I should really make sure that it didn't get
[00:48:45.040 --> 00:48:47.360]   like shoddled away into notifications or one
[00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:48.000]   of the other labels--
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:49.480]   Yeah, because it has a new earpiece and--
[00:48:49.480 --> 00:48:51.600]   Yeah, the new earpiece and all that.
[00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:52.880]   Yeah, no, I haven't gotten that yet.
[00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:54.560]   In fact, I'm going to check on that,
[00:48:54.560 --> 00:48:58.400]   because I would like to get the new hardware.
[00:48:58.400 --> 00:49:02.520]   Currently, if this then that has added a Google Glass channel,
[00:49:02.520 --> 00:49:03.400]   that's intriguing.
[00:49:03.400 --> 00:49:04.920]   I must be using the GDK.
[00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:05.920]   Yeah.
[00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:06.920]   Yeah.
[00:49:06.920 --> 00:49:07.920]   Yeah.
[00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:09.720]   So I don't know what kind of events you would want to trigger,
[00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:11.240]   but like--
[00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:12.600]   Like show me a card when--
[00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:13.600]   Right.
[00:49:13.600 --> 00:49:14.600]   --the guy--
[00:49:14.600 --> 00:49:15.600]   What did you set up for?
[00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:17.720]   I have TTT-- oh, the Twitter IPO on notifications.
[00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:19.000]   Yeah, but it would be cool.
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:21.040]   No, no, Nexus 5 ordering or something.
[00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:22.320]   Can you read the Glass 2.0?
[00:49:22.320 --> 00:49:24.600]   Right, the next 5 order.
[00:49:24.600 --> 00:49:28.520]   Wouldn't it be cool if you set it up with Google Keep?
[00:49:28.520 --> 00:49:31.920]   Show me my shopping list when I enter the grocery store.
[00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:33.520]   Yeah.
[00:49:33.520 --> 00:49:34.880]   Now you're talking.
[00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:36.080]   That'd be kind of neat.
[00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:37.240]   Yeah.
[00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:37.920]   So what can we do?
[00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:39.040]   What are the actions?
[00:49:39.040 --> 00:49:41.920]   Send a notification to your Google Glass timeline.
[00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:44.200]   Message, image, URL, and URL.
[00:49:44.200 --> 00:49:45.880]   Oh, but there are no triggers.
[00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:46.880]   So--
[00:49:46.880 --> 00:49:47.600]   That's meaningless.
[00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:50.240]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:54.320]   OK, so thank you.
[00:49:54.320 --> 00:49:54.800]   Well, wait a minute.
[00:49:54.800 --> 00:49:55.560]   Oh, OK.
[00:49:55.560 --> 00:49:56.040]   So--
[00:49:56.040 --> 00:49:57.040]   Oh, yeah, you can.
[00:49:57.040 --> 00:49:57.880]   You just haven't set it up.
[00:49:57.880 --> 00:49:58.400]   Yeah.
[00:49:58.400 --> 00:49:58.400]   Yeah.
[00:49:58.400 --> 00:49:59.480]   Oh, that was Chad's.
[00:49:59.480 --> 00:50:00.400]   Oh, OK.
[00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:00.680]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:50:00.680 --> 00:50:01.760]   This is just using the mirror.
[00:50:01.760 --> 00:50:03.280]   Yeah, Glass can't trigger anything,
[00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:04.240]   but other things can trigger.
[00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:06.200]   There are other things that have Glass triggers.
[00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:06.680]   Right.
[00:50:06.680 --> 00:50:07.200]   Right.
[00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:10.800]   So anything if this and that pocket can trigger Glass,
[00:50:10.800 --> 00:50:11.880]   the action, can trigger the action.
[00:50:11.880 --> 00:50:13.440]   But all you can send is a notification.
[00:50:13.440 --> 00:50:19.040]   So if there's one, if you're mentioned on Reddit,
[00:50:19.040 --> 00:50:20.680]   find out right away via Glass.
[00:50:20.680 --> 00:50:21.120]   That's good.
[00:50:21.120 --> 00:50:21.960]   I like it.
[00:50:21.960 --> 00:50:23.120]   These are recipes.
[00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:25.200]   This is probably used in the mirror API.
[00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:27.760]   The GDK will enable Glass having its own trigger.
[00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:31.160]   So you can imagine, because the GDK lets
[00:50:31.160 --> 00:50:33.640]   you do things like access location
[00:50:33.640 --> 00:50:34.800]   and that kind of thing.
[00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:36.560]   A trigger might be when I'm in a route,
[00:50:36.560 --> 00:50:37.760]   show me my grocery list.
[00:50:37.760 --> 00:50:39.000]   Right.
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:40.600]   Neat.
[00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:41.600]   Rain monitor.
[00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:43.120]   That's what you need.
[00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:43.840]   Rain monitor.
[00:50:43.840 --> 00:50:45.280]   Is it raining?
[00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:47.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:49.280]   I have TTT channels for Glass, right on?
[00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:49.800]   I love it.
[00:50:49.800 --> 00:50:51.160]   Really awesome.
[00:50:51.160 --> 00:50:54.200]   I love if this than that.
[00:50:54.200 --> 00:50:57.160]   IftTT, put the internet to work for you.com.
[00:50:57.160 --> 00:50:59.200]   So is that like cooling weather underground or something
[00:50:59.200 --> 00:51:00.560]   to see if it's raining locally?
[00:51:00.560 --> 00:51:01.480]   Yeah.
[00:51:01.480 --> 00:51:02.320]   Hello.
[00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:03.560]   Am I wet?
[00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:04.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:51:04.840 --> 00:51:06.040]   Your glass could be wet.
[00:51:06.040 --> 00:51:12.480]   One of the example, Glassware apps
[00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:15.560]   with the new GDK is Word Lens.
[00:51:15.560 --> 00:51:18.440]   So if you're reading a sign in another language,
[00:51:18.440 --> 00:51:22.560]   as you're looking at it, it'll translate on Glass for you.
[00:51:22.560 --> 00:51:27.680]   It'll live translation does you read.
[00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:29.720]   So I'm sure you all saw this.
[00:51:29.720 --> 00:51:33.480]   Google wins in court after seven years.
[00:51:33.480 --> 00:51:37.280]   The authors Guild sued Google over its book Scanning.
[00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:41.080]   And the judge said, you know what?
[00:51:41.080 --> 00:51:42.400]   It is fair use.
[00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:43.440]   It's transformed.
[00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:45.800]   It fits all of the fair use defenses.
[00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:47.280]   It's transformational.
[00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:51.040]   There's no monetary harm to the authors Guild.
[00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:55.440]   And it has a great benefit to mankind.
[00:51:55.440 --> 00:51:56.640]   So thank you, Judge Chin.
[00:51:56.640 --> 00:51:59.960]   Unfortunately, the author said Guild says,
[00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:02.840]   even though we've spent millions of dollars
[00:52:02.840 --> 00:52:05.400]   to stop this, we're going to the Supreme Court.
[00:52:05.400 --> 00:52:06.800]   So they will appeal.
[00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:08.800]   And we shall see what happens on appeal.
[00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:10.360]   [SIGHS]
[00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:11.600]   Preserve the knowledge.
[00:52:11.600 --> 00:52:13.600]   Preserve the knowledge.
[00:52:13.600 --> 00:52:14.600]   [SIGHS]
[00:52:14.600 --> 00:52:16.760]   That was actually a lot better than the settlement
[00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:19.920]   that was there before, which only favored Google.
[00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:22.680]   Whereas it's settling it in a generic way,
[00:52:22.680 --> 00:52:25.080]   saying this act is fair use, which
[00:52:25.080 --> 00:52:28.040]   means that other people could put the scan books like the
[00:52:28.040 --> 00:52:30.880]   Internet Archive and libraries that do this too
[00:52:30.880 --> 00:52:32.240]   can benefit from this ruling too.
[00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:34.000]   Whereas the second one they had before was basically a
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:35.480]   carve out just for Google.
[00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:39.120]   So this is definitely a good progress for this kind of thing.
[00:52:39.120 --> 00:52:42.640]   OK, because I had read somewhere that the thought was
[00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:47.320]   that this is so constrained of a decision, it wasn't valuable
[00:52:47.320 --> 00:52:47.800]   past this.
[00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:52.320]   So you think this is a good fair use victory.
[00:52:52.320 --> 00:52:53.040]   Yeah.
[00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:54.040]   Exactly.
[00:52:54.040 --> 00:52:55.040]   That's really good.
[00:52:55.040 --> 00:52:59.920]   Before there was a settlement that was written between the--
[00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:02.520]   The Google offered a settlement, right.
[00:53:02.520 --> 00:53:03.240]   Yeah.
[00:53:03.240 --> 00:53:06.080]   And we can sell these and give them--
[00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:08.560]   and it basically gave them a right to scan things that
[00:53:08.560 --> 00:53:12.960]   other people didn't have, which was problematic.
[00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:15.640]   And basically, a carve out between the authors' good.
[00:53:15.640 --> 00:53:18.920]   And also, it meant that it was restricted to certain
[00:53:18.920 --> 00:53:19.920]   countries' things as well.
[00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:22.520]   And one of the huge advantages of the Google Books thing is
[00:53:22.520 --> 00:53:24.280]   that it's globally accessible.
[00:53:24.280 --> 00:53:26.520]   And it's massively used in the developing world where you
[00:53:26.520 --> 00:53:28.240]   can't even buy some of these books.
[00:53:28.240 --> 00:53:30.240]   Well, and that's an interesting question.
[00:53:30.240 --> 00:53:31.160]   I think this is great.
[00:53:31.160 --> 00:53:33.440]   And I love-- I mean, this is what Google's mission is--
[00:53:33.440 --> 00:53:37.200]   to search all the knowledge of the world and make it
[00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:38.720]   available at your fingertips.
[00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:40.480]   And this is exactly what Google's mission is.
[00:53:40.480 --> 00:53:42.440]   And it's right.
[00:53:42.440 --> 00:53:47.040]   But a lot of people said, oh, Leo, Google's ripping off
[00:53:47.040 --> 00:53:50.000]   authors, because what's to stop me from using this search
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:53.240]   to print out a book?
[00:53:53.240 --> 00:53:56.360]   It's like, have you met BitTorrent?
[00:53:56.360 --> 00:53:58.200]   If you want to do that, you can do that.
[00:53:58.200 --> 00:54:01.760]   And a lot easier than searching page by page, printing it out,
[00:54:01.760 --> 00:54:02.640]   bit by bit.
[00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:03.640]   It would cost you more.
[00:54:03.640 --> 00:54:07.320]   Just buy the darn book, if that's really the issue.
[00:54:07.320 --> 00:54:10.000]   Google Books, according to the court,
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:12.120]   does not supersede or supplant books,
[00:54:12.120 --> 00:54:15.160]   because it is not a tool to be used to read books.
[00:54:15.160 --> 00:54:19.640]   Instead, the court held it adds value to the original.
[00:54:19.640 --> 00:54:23.320]   It allows for the creation of new information, new aesthetics,
[00:54:23.320 --> 00:54:25.040]   new insights, and understandings.
[00:54:25.040 --> 00:54:27.040]   It is transformational.
[00:54:27.040 --> 00:54:28.920]   It is transformative.
[00:54:28.920 --> 00:54:32.040]   And that's huge.
[00:54:32.040 --> 00:54:34.560]   And I think the judge-- I think Judge Shin deserves a pat
[00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:36.440]   in the back that got it exactly right.
[00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:43.320]   And the idea of the race is fully free from it.
[00:54:43.320 --> 00:54:44.320]   Yeah.
[00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:45.320]   Yeah.
[00:54:45.320 --> 00:54:46.600]   Tremendous victory for fair.
[00:54:46.600 --> 00:54:47.120]   Tremendous victory for fair.
[00:54:47.120 --> 00:54:49.000]   They're used in public interest.
[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:50.000]   Yeah.
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:55.560]   You know, most of these books, by the way, are out of print.
[00:54:55.560 --> 00:54:57.880]   They wouldn't be accessible at all.
[00:54:57.880 --> 00:55:00.000]   The vast majority of these books.
[00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:02.640]   But let's say your-- who was it?
[00:55:02.640 --> 00:55:06.800]   It was really-- it was one of the thriller writers
[00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:10.080]   who was really dead set against this.
[00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:11.440]   Is it King?
[00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:12.640]   No, it wasn't Stephen King.
[00:55:12.640 --> 00:55:14.280]   It was-- oh, I can't remember.
[00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:14.840]   Metallica?
[00:55:14.840 --> 00:55:15.720]   No.
[00:55:15.720 --> 00:55:16.720]   Metallica, yeah.
[00:55:16.720 --> 00:55:20.320]   It was Lars Ulrich.
[00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:24.560]   One of these people really felt like they
[00:55:24.560 --> 00:55:27.720]   was taking money out of my pocket.
[00:55:27.720 --> 00:55:29.440]   I just have a hard time.
[00:55:29.440 --> 00:55:31.240]   Really, I think this makes perfect sense.
[00:55:31.240 --> 00:55:33.360]   They want you to be able to search for it.
[00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:36.560]   In the long run, I think you're going to sell more books, not
[00:55:36.560 --> 00:55:37.200]   less than--
[00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:37.920]   Why is it a discovery?
[00:55:37.920 --> 00:55:39.720]   It's a discovery tool.
[00:55:39.720 --> 00:55:42.720]   But this is always the argument that always
[00:55:42.720 --> 00:55:46.560]   happens with content creators when the internet gets involved.
[00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:48.800]   Ah, they're going to steal Robbie Blind.
[00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:50.560]   It was Scott Tarot.
[00:55:50.560 --> 00:55:51.160]   That's who it was.
[00:55:51.160 --> 00:55:51.680]   Thank you.
[00:55:51.680 --> 00:55:52.360]   Scott Tarot.
[00:55:52.360 --> 00:55:53.560]   Dendreth, the chattering.
[00:55:53.560 --> 00:55:55.360]   Who writes the legal through in this way?
[00:55:55.360 --> 00:55:57.640]   Yeah, he writes legal.
[00:55:57.640 --> 00:55:58.120]   But--
[00:55:58.120 --> 00:55:59.840]   He can actually understand law.
[00:55:59.840 --> 00:56:00.520]   I doubt--
[00:56:00.520 --> 00:56:01.040]   Right.
[00:56:01.040 --> 00:56:01.600]   No, he was a lawyer.
[00:56:01.600 --> 00:56:02.800]   It's sort of an outstanding plug.
[00:56:02.800 --> 00:56:04.200]   It's about understanding the internet, right?
[00:56:04.200 --> 00:56:04.800]   It's about understanding what--
[00:56:04.800 --> 00:56:06.040]   I think that's what it really is.
[00:56:06.040 --> 00:56:08.440]   He was a lawyer when he started writing.
[00:56:08.440 --> 00:56:12.880]   And they say he's still a practicing lawyer.
[00:56:12.880 --> 00:56:14.480]   But I just think he misses--
[00:56:14.480 --> 00:56:17.000]   I don't-- well, it remains to be seen.
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:18.920]   And I understand he's afraid that he's
[00:56:18.920 --> 00:56:21.200]   going to lose revenue.
[00:56:21.200 --> 00:56:22.960]   But I just can't imagine that that
[00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:24.400]   would be the result of this.
[00:56:24.400 --> 00:56:26.520]   Nobody's going to go page by page, print it out,
[00:56:26.520 --> 00:56:29.080]   and then say, whoo, I didn't have to read it.
[00:56:29.080 --> 00:56:30.480]   Was it John Grisham?
[00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:31.720]   Well, it's one of them.
[00:56:31.720 --> 00:56:34.840]   I thought it was Taro.
[00:56:34.840 --> 00:56:36.560]   Anyway, good news.
[00:56:36.560 --> 00:56:38.080]   But not done.
[00:56:38.080 --> 00:56:40.720]   The author's guild's appealing.
[00:56:40.720 --> 00:56:45.520]   And I love what EFF says at the end of their article
[00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:47.600]   by Corinne McSherry.
[00:56:47.600 --> 00:56:49.440]   She says, well said, Judge Chin.
[00:56:49.440 --> 00:56:51.480]   Let's hope other courts take heed.
[00:56:51.480 --> 00:56:53.480]   The author's guild has already declared it will appeal
[00:56:53.480 --> 00:56:53.920]   the ruling.
[00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:56.160]   Its membership might want to consider
[00:56:56.160 --> 00:56:58.440]   whether they really want to spend more of their dues
[00:56:58.440 --> 00:57:03.040]   on this misguided litigation.
[00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:05.760]   Sounds good news.
[00:57:05.760 --> 00:57:08.320]   And really, you're just not going to cost you anything.
[00:57:08.320 --> 00:57:09.560]   It's not going to cost you a reason.
[00:57:09.560 --> 00:57:11.360]   It's going to help you.
[00:57:11.360 --> 00:57:13.120]   New Yorker doing it again.
[00:57:13.120 --> 00:57:15.520]   I think the New Yorker's really starting
[00:57:15.520 --> 00:57:17.320]   to do a lot of technology coverage
[00:57:17.320 --> 00:57:18.840]   and do a really good job of it.
[00:57:18.840 --> 00:57:22.680]   They have an article in this week's New Yorker
[00:57:22.680 --> 00:57:27.280]   by Burkhardt-Bilger, a reporter at large, called Auto Correct,
[00:57:27.280 --> 00:57:32.160]   as the self-driving car at last arrived.
[00:57:32.160 --> 00:57:33.120]   That was good.
[00:57:33.120 --> 00:57:34.960]   Yeah, Burkhardt says, human beings
[00:57:34.960 --> 00:57:39.720]   make terrible drivers of the 10 million accidents
[00:57:39.720 --> 00:57:41.080]   Americans are in every year.
[00:57:41.080 --> 00:57:46.680]   9 and 1/2 million are their own damn fault.
[00:57:46.680 --> 00:57:51.240]   Well, there's been a huge round in the UK this week about
[00:57:51.240 --> 00:57:55.520]   basically several cyclists have been killed in a row.
[00:57:55.520 --> 00:57:58.240]   Cyclists get killed on the streets of London fairly regularly,
[00:57:58.240 --> 00:58:01.320]   but six got killed in two weeks or something.
[00:58:01.320 --> 00:58:04.280]   So something that isn't outcry about Laurie's killing
[00:58:04.280 --> 00:58:05.400]   Cyclists in London.
[00:58:05.400 --> 00:58:07.680]   But half the outcry is why are Laurie's killing Cyclists
[00:58:07.680 --> 00:58:10.720]   hit their half outcry is why are Cyclists so careless
[00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:11.880]   that they get killed?
[00:58:11.880 --> 00:58:12.880]   That's so.
[00:58:12.880 --> 00:58:14.560]   And the mayor of London said, let's cyclists
[00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:15.560]   go in now with headphones on.
[00:58:15.560 --> 00:58:16.400]   We should ban that.
[00:58:16.400 --> 00:58:17.400]   Oh.
[00:58:17.400 --> 00:58:19.400]   No, if I've got-- and I've done this--
[00:58:19.400 --> 00:58:21.040]   if I've got headphones on in London,
[00:58:21.040 --> 00:58:22.680]   it's because I'm listening to Google turn by turn
[00:58:22.680 --> 00:58:25.440]   cycling directions so I can watch the traffic at the same time
[00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:27.800]   as working out where the hell I'm going.
[00:58:27.800 --> 00:58:29.240]   I'm not sitting--
[00:58:29.240 --> 00:58:31.680]   and these little white things, it's not--
[00:58:31.680 --> 00:58:33.080]   I can still hear the outside work.
[00:58:33.080 --> 00:58:35.120]   Well, massive misunderstanding what's going on.
[00:58:35.120 --> 00:58:37.000]   We're up here in the wine country
[00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:39.400]   where there's lots of cyclists on the road,
[00:58:39.400 --> 00:58:42.760]   and they are with great regularity plowed into
[00:58:42.760 --> 00:58:45.920]   by drivers who are messing with the radio,
[00:58:45.920 --> 00:58:48.960]   bending over, trying to find something on the floor,
[00:58:48.960 --> 00:58:50.600]   and the driver just doesn't pay attention.
[00:58:50.600 --> 00:58:52.720]   Their car veers right into the plows in the cyclists.
[00:58:52.720 --> 00:58:57.960]   It happens a lot, at least every summer, one or two times.
[00:58:57.960 --> 00:59:02.200]   So I am a big proponent of, I think, auto driving cars
[00:59:02.200 --> 00:59:03.160]   are a great idea.
[00:59:03.160 --> 00:59:05.040]   I wonder, though, does-- and I think
[00:59:05.040 --> 00:59:06.320]   the thing that's going to put it over the top,
[00:59:06.320 --> 00:59:07.840]   A, is we're getting used to it.
[00:59:07.840 --> 00:59:10.880]   I really believe that the conversation has shifted a lot
[00:59:10.880 --> 00:59:14.000]   in the last few years, thanks to Google.
[00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:17.160]   But secondly, I also think that insurance companies
[00:59:17.160 --> 00:59:18.640]   are going to end up putting it over the top
[00:59:18.640 --> 00:59:22.840]   by offering great discounts for cars that drive themselves.
[00:59:22.840 --> 00:59:23.800]   Well, the thing is, we're starting
[00:59:23.800 --> 00:59:25.520]   to see this anyway with other features.
[00:59:25.520 --> 00:59:27.960]   And that was the connection between the two stories for me
[00:59:27.960 --> 00:59:31.600]   was that the new cars you buy now have blind spot radar.
[00:59:31.600 --> 00:59:32.640]   Right.
[00:59:32.640 --> 00:59:34.640]   So if there's something moving in your blind spot
[00:59:34.640 --> 00:59:38.160]   and you signal a turn, it beeps at you and says, ah, no,
[00:59:38.160 --> 00:59:40.480]   don't do that yet.
[00:59:40.480 --> 00:59:42.680]   And that's enormously useful.
[00:59:42.680 --> 00:59:45.320]   I mean, we just got one new car that has that.
[00:59:45.320 --> 00:59:47.760]   And then I'm driving the other car and I'm thinking,
[00:59:47.760 --> 00:59:48.480]   it's not beeping.
[00:59:48.480 --> 00:59:48.960]   Oh, right.
[00:59:48.960 --> 00:59:51.000]   I better check the mirrors even more.
[00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:53.120]   But the lorries need that.
[00:59:53.120 --> 00:59:56.520]   The big trucks that are killing the cyclists,
[00:59:56.520 --> 00:59:59.680]   they have a-- there's a video from Transport for London
[00:59:59.680 --> 01:00:03.160]   that shows this where, when you're turning the car--
[01:00:03.160 --> 01:00:07.120]   turning a car that's a semi, so the cab turns separately,
[01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:10.400]   your left hand, your inside mirror is useless,
[01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:12.800]   because it's then pointing at the side of the truck.
[01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:18.880]   And the entirety of that side of what's one vehicle length
[01:00:18.880 --> 01:00:20.680]   the side of you is completely invisible.
[01:00:20.680 --> 01:00:24.440]   And so 20 cyclists can be invisible to a driver.
[01:00:24.440 --> 01:00:28.560]   So my take on this is they should make blind spot radar
[01:00:28.560 --> 01:00:31.880]   mandatory for trucks and lorries and buses.
[01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:37.520]   The trucks in the US often have bumper stickers that say,
[01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:38.920]   and I think this is good.
[01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:41.360]   If you can't see me, I can't see you.
[01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:42.600]   I can't see you.
[01:00:42.600 --> 01:00:44.480]   And I think that's an important message,
[01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:46.920]   that if you don't see the driver in his mirrors,
[01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:48.280]   he's not seeing you.
[01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:51.320]   So this video that you sent us in the chatroom
[01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:55.040]   is really quite stunning, because look at the mirrors
[01:00:55.040 --> 01:00:56.200]   on this truck.
[01:00:56.200 --> 01:00:58.680]   You look in the mirrors, there's no cyclists.
[01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:00.960]   There's nobody out there.
[01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:03.120]   This would be a good time to turn left if you're this truck
[01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:04.280]   driver.
[01:01:04.280 --> 01:01:07.640]   Now this is a British truck with the wheel on the right.
[01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:08.520]   So that's important.
[01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:11.720]   It would be opposite, obviously, in the United States.
[01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:14.560]   But watch, he gets out of the truck and walks around,
[01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:19.240]   and there is a fleet of bicyclists right there.
[01:01:19.240 --> 01:01:20.240]   Right there.
[01:01:20.240 --> 01:01:23.240]   And it's along the entire length of the truck.
[01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:25.840]   It's not just like one bicyclist in a blind spot.
[01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:27.400]   It is 20 bicyclists.
[01:01:27.400 --> 01:01:29.400]   It's not big when you're turning, because the mirror
[01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:31.000]   is then pointing at the side of the truck.
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:34.040]   So this is why you need radar.
[01:01:34.040 --> 01:01:36.120]   Unbelievable.
[01:01:36.120 --> 01:01:37.720]   You could be wearing headphones or not.
[01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:39.800]   This truck will squish you.
[01:01:39.800 --> 01:01:42.480]   So this makes me think, OK, I'm not going the trucks.
[01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:43.760]   Well, I'm sorry.
[01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:47.520]   Yeah, that's probably another message.
[01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:50.000]   Anyway, I mean, I think so many reasons
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:54.160]   to distracted driving teens texting.
[01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:57.240]   I haven't got a question, though, because I think that,
[01:01:57.240 --> 01:02:00.120]   ideally, this would happen with the flick of a finger,
[01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:03.640]   and everybody would be autonomous.
[01:02:03.640 --> 01:02:06.360]   And then we would never have any accidents.
[01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:10.200]   But I think if you have half or more of the drivers'
[01:02:10.200 --> 01:02:12.600]   humans making stupid errors, you're still
[01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:14.640]   going to have accidents with autonomous vehicles,
[01:02:14.640 --> 01:02:15.800]   because there's some accidents you
[01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:19.080]   can't avoid if somebody does something stupid.
[01:02:19.080 --> 01:02:21.120]   And I think that's going to be a problem.
[01:02:21.120 --> 01:02:22.040]   Well, that's the thing.
[01:02:22.040 --> 01:02:24.160]   The way the autonomous-- so A, this happens
[01:02:24.160 --> 01:02:26.200]   is going to happen incrementally.
[01:02:26.200 --> 01:02:28.800]   It's not going to happen with a flip of a quick finger.
[01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:30.120]   Because what we get is the cars
[01:02:30.120 --> 01:02:32.280]   to get better automation and more tools,
[01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:35.160]   like the blind spot radar or light lane following,
[01:02:35.160 --> 01:02:38.240]   like, front radar that's the warns you about hit,
[01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:41.840]   and shouts you to put the brakes on,
[01:02:41.840 --> 01:02:43.800]   and things like that.
[01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:46.440]   Incrementally, the cars riding more of this.
[01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:48.120]   Several cars have automatic parking,
[01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:51.400]   which is a self-driving backwards at low speeds
[01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:52.600]   into a parking space.
[01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:55.840]   So this is not going to-- we're not going to suddenly
[01:02:55.840 --> 01:02:57.960]   have a button on the thing that does this,
[01:02:57.960 --> 01:03:01.320]   but it's incremental features that move into the cars.
[01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:04.200]   And the other thing is that they're all
[01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:06.840]   assuming that they've got to deal with human drivers as well,
[01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:09.360]   which is, if you said, oh, the driver's going to be robots,
[01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:11.160]   you can do completely different things.
[01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:13.520]   But then you can't assume that.
[01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:15.440]   And you can have to assume human drivers for a long time.
[01:03:15.440 --> 01:03:18.520]   But as you say, it'll happen over time
[01:03:18.520 --> 01:03:21.080]   that you'll get insurance discounts for the cars
[01:03:21.080 --> 01:03:25.240]   that have these features, because they will have fewer accidents.
[01:03:25.240 --> 01:03:26.840]   Yeah, I mean, these cars have to be programmed
[01:03:26.840 --> 01:03:28.800]   to assume, you know, unpredictably behavior.
[01:03:28.800 --> 01:03:31.480]   And it's not just human drivers, right?
[01:03:31.480 --> 01:03:33.000]   It's animals running out into the road.
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.200]   It's trees that have fallen into the road.
[01:03:35.200 --> 01:03:36.640]   I mean, you know, unpredictable things
[01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:37.840]   happen on the road all the time.
[01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:40.520]   And it isn't just about human drivers.
[01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:42.600]   And obviously, this is definitely going to happen--
[01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:43.680]   There still be accidents.
[01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:44.120]   You're right.
[01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:44.480]   Yeah.
[01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:45.720]   And there's still going to be accidents, right?
[01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:48.000]   I mean, we're just talking about reducing accidents.
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:49.200]   There's always going to be accidents.
[01:03:49.200 --> 01:03:53.160]   Avoiding avoidable accidents, I guess, is the key on this.
[01:03:53.160 --> 01:03:54.560]   And a car can do that.
[01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:57.440]   It can drive better than any human ever could.
[01:03:57.440 --> 01:03:59.080]   This article in The New Yorker is great.
[01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:01.160]   And they're interviewing Sebastian Thrun,
[01:04:01.160 --> 01:04:03.360]   who's the head of the Google--
[01:04:03.360 --> 01:04:05.720]   He said, he laughed.
[01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:06.560]   He's doing you dusty now.
[01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:07.400]   He was.
[01:04:07.400 --> 01:04:08.200]   Founded it, yeah.
[01:04:08.200 --> 01:04:08.640]   That's right.
[01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:10.600]   Yeah, he's doing a dacity.
[01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:12.280]   But he does interview him.
[01:04:12.280 --> 01:04:14.320]   I don't know if this is-- it's not an old article.
[01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:15.320]   It's a brand new article.
[01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:19.120]   So I wonder-- well, anyway, one of the things they point out
[01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:21.600]   is the Google car has driven now
[01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:24.680]   that more than half a million miles without causing an accident.
[01:04:24.680 --> 01:04:26.280]   And this is the stat you hear all the time,
[01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:28.760]   twice as far as the average American driver goes before
[01:04:28.760 --> 01:04:29.680]   crashing.
[01:04:29.680 --> 01:04:34.480]   But-- and this is something you don't hear in the PR for this.
[01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:36.480]   Left to its own devices, Thrun says,
[01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:39.360]   it could only go about 50,000 miles on freeways
[01:04:39.360 --> 01:04:43.120]   without a major mistake.
[01:04:43.120 --> 01:04:44.520]   It's not there yet.
[01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:45.800]   This kind of was a surprise to me.
[01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:48.480]   Google calls this the dog food stage, not quite fit
[01:04:48.480 --> 01:04:49.680]   for human consumption.
[01:04:49.680 --> 01:04:51.720]   They always have a human driver there
[01:04:51.720 --> 01:04:53.840]   with his hands hovered over the wheel.
[01:04:53.840 --> 01:04:55.440]   Thrun says, the risk is too high.
[01:04:55.440 --> 01:04:56.320]   You would never accept it.
[01:04:56.320 --> 01:04:59.400]   The car has trouble in the rain, for instance.
[01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:02.400]   When its lasers bounce off shiny surfaces.
[01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:03.760]   It's in the surface in California.
[01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:04.560]   Yeah.
[01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:07.760]   The first drops call forth a small icon of a cloud on screen
[01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:08.840]   and a voice warning.
[01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:11.040]   Auto drive will soon engage.
[01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:12.360]   Disengage.
[01:05:12.360 --> 01:05:17.200]   It can't tell what concrete from dry or fresh asphalt from firm.
[01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:20.600]   And of course, it can't hear a traffic cop's whistle
[01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:22.120]   or follow hand signals.
[01:05:22.120 --> 01:05:25.000]   So you're not going to be able to sit in the back seat
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:26.800]   for a long time to come.
[01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:33.400]   But it's in San Francisco, San Jose, the Bay Area
[01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:36.400]   for the first time in eight months yesterday.
[01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:39.200]   And loads of accidents, none of those drivers in memory
[01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:41.240]   just didn't be able to tell what from dry on what's breaking
[01:05:41.240 --> 01:05:41.760]   with light.
[01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:42.760]   That's true.
[01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:44.200]   So I think the part of the problem
[01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:45.800]   is that they're developing it here,
[01:05:45.800 --> 01:05:47.240]   where it doesn't rain that often.
[01:05:47.240 --> 01:05:49.960]   And so they haven't hit those test conditions.
[01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:53.120]   If they were developing in New England, they'd say, oh, yeah.
[01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:55.200]   There's this frozen stuff on the ground.
[01:05:55.200 --> 01:05:56.520]   We might need to deal with that.
[01:05:56.520 --> 01:05:59.760]   Thrun did say that within a year, it should be safe for twice
[01:05:59.760 --> 01:06:02.480]   the amount, 100,000 miles.
[01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:05.360]   I mean, they're definitely improving rapidly.
[01:06:05.360 --> 01:06:07.120]   The other thing that how they work at the moment
[01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:10.000]   is they're based on already having
[01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.240]   lidar scans of that road.
[01:06:12.240 --> 01:06:16.320]   So they have to have driven the road at least twice.
[01:06:16.320 --> 01:06:17.200]   Oh, that's--
[01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:19.320]   Oh, interesting.
[01:06:19.320 --> 01:06:23.760]   But the scanning thing so that they know at a high resolution
[01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:27.360]   what's road and what isn't before they can reliably drive
[01:06:27.360 --> 01:06:27.880]   in it.
[01:06:27.880 --> 01:06:29.440]   So the other point of having humans there
[01:06:29.440 --> 01:06:33.480]   was they had to drive lots and lots of roads first
[01:06:33.480 --> 01:06:36.600]   before they could actually have enough data for the machines
[01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:37.880]   to make sensible decisions.
[01:06:37.880 --> 01:06:40.800]   Because they need to understand what's actually
[01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:42.720]   street furniture and what's movable.
[01:06:42.720 --> 01:06:45.880]   So they can tell moving things.
[01:06:45.880 --> 01:06:47.240]   They can say, oh, there's a bicyclist.
[01:06:47.240 --> 01:06:48.080]   There's a person walking.
[01:06:48.080 --> 01:06:50.000]   There's something moving there.
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:52.080]   But they can't tell a person standing on the corner
[01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:53.480]   of the street from the lamppost unless they
[01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:55.000]   have an idea of what's what.
[01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:56.440]   So they have to--
[01:06:56.440 --> 01:06:59.120]   so they can't say that something might move.
[01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:02.120]   So there's a certain--
[01:07:02.120 --> 01:07:05.200]   building that resolution detail and information
[01:07:05.200 --> 01:07:08.400]   about the streets is a big part of what
[01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:11.080]   makes the Google ones more reliable than the previous ones
[01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:13.640]   because they have that, both because they've driven it
[01:07:13.640 --> 01:07:16.320]   with street view cars, which now have the same scanners in,
[01:07:16.320 --> 01:07:17.960]   but also originally because they were driving it
[01:07:17.960 --> 01:07:19.360]   with those particular cars.
[01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:22.560]   So they're talking the article about his car driving him
[01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:24.600]   to work every day because it's following the same route.
[01:07:24.600 --> 01:07:26.840]   And so that's a route they know really well.
[01:07:26.840 --> 01:07:29.600]   But when they go through diversion,
[01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:31.720]   it can get a bit confused when you have to pay more attention
[01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:31.920]   to it.
[01:07:31.920 --> 01:07:39.440]   Yeah, I'm getting very used to the automated features
[01:07:39.440 --> 01:07:40.960]   in my new car.
[01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:45.600]   And I have that blind side awareness system.
[01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:47.840]   So a light goes on with some cars in my blind side
[01:07:47.840 --> 01:07:49.320]   or something's in my blind side.
[01:07:49.320 --> 01:07:50.000]   That's great.
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000]   And it's a big bright light on the rear view mirror.
[01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:53.720]   So I know immediately.
[01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:57.560]   But my one is if I indicate and there's something
[01:07:57.560 --> 01:07:59.080]   that it actually makes a noise to warn me.
[01:07:59.080 --> 01:08:00.080]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:04.280]   I have lane guidance too.
[01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:07.040]   So it has cameras all over the car.
[01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:08.600]   It sees the stripes in the road.
[01:08:08.600 --> 01:08:11.240]   If I veer into it, it's as if there are bots dots there.
[01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:13.320]   It's like the wheel vibrates.
[01:08:13.320 --> 01:08:15.240]   And the seat belt goes--
[01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:17.520]   And that really does kind of-- OK, I'm sorry.
[01:08:17.520 --> 01:08:18.880]   I'm veering out of my lane.
[01:08:18.880 --> 01:08:20.160]   That works quite well.
[01:08:20.160 --> 01:08:21.640]   I have--
[01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:23.960]   So the big chunk of this is getting those performances right.
[01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:24.440]   Yeah.
[01:08:24.440 --> 01:08:26.520]   Making sure that the feedback you're getting from the car
[01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:28.320]   is actually contextual and--
[01:08:28.320 --> 01:08:29.600]   Use your interface.
[01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:31.880]   It's always a challenge, isn't it?
[01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:33.560]   Man, I got to get a new car.
[01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:35.080]   I have-- my favorite--
[01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:36.600]   Especially if you're driving in the car.
[01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:40.440]   Because I use this all the time is the cruise control.
[01:08:40.440 --> 01:08:41.680]   It has adaptive cruise control.
[01:08:41.680 --> 01:08:42.960]   So it sees the car in front of me.
[01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:44.760]   And I can actually see an image of the car.
[01:08:44.760 --> 01:08:46.800]   I could see a safe distance.
[01:08:46.800 --> 01:08:49.160]   And there's like a red thing and a green thing.
[01:08:49.160 --> 01:08:51.280]   And as soon as I get into the--
[01:08:51.280 --> 01:08:52.400]   Start getting too close to the car.
[01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:53.720]   It slows me down.
[01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:55.800]   And it maintains a safe distance at all times.
[01:08:55.800 --> 01:08:58.200]   So I actually use cruise control much more
[01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:02.800]   than I would normally because it enforces a safe distance.
[01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:05.040]   Oh, so the cruise control I see adjusts itself.
[01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:06.320]   Yeah, it'll actually stop the car.
[01:09:06.320 --> 01:09:09.200]   If the car in front of me stops, I can just sit here.
[01:09:09.200 --> 01:09:13.160]   And I will slow down, slow down, and then I will stop.
[01:09:13.160 --> 01:09:14.400]   It's awesome.
[01:09:14.400 --> 01:09:16.560]   Yeah, I mean, that makes a ton of sense, right?
[01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:18.280]   Like that's awesome.
[01:09:18.280 --> 01:09:21.000]   So you'd really do get used to this stuff.
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:23.320]   I also have night vision.
[01:09:23.320 --> 01:09:24.760]   It's got infrared sensors.
[01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:27.720]   So when you can see, it's really kind of interesting.
[01:09:27.720 --> 01:09:30.200]   Because you see the hotspots on cars, the engine
[01:09:30.200 --> 01:09:31.280]   and the exhaust.
[01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:33.480]   And then if there's a human, it outlines it in green.
[01:09:33.480 --> 01:09:35.120]   It sees a human shape.
[01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:36.760]   And so at night when I'm driving,
[01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:40.840]   I can see live things kind of highlighted.
[01:09:40.840 --> 01:09:41.280]   Wow.
[01:09:41.280 --> 01:09:43.640]   Can you see if like there are babies or dogs or like pets
[01:09:43.640 --> 01:09:44.680]   in the car or for me?
[01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:46.000]   What I have doesn't do that.
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.680]   Next year's edition, we'll do it with any live creature.
[01:09:48.680 --> 01:09:49.760]   That sounds like a phone.
[01:09:49.760 --> 01:09:53.040]   Babies or pets.
[01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:54.400]   That's generally not in cars.
[01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:55.240]   It's walking, right?
[01:09:55.240 --> 01:09:57.520]   It's to avoid pedestrians or cyclists and that kind of thing.
[01:09:57.520 --> 01:09:57.880]   Gotcha.
[01:09:57.880 --> 01:09:58.880]   OK.
[01:09:58.880 --> 01:09:59.280]   I see.
[01:09:59.280 --> 01:09:59.720]   Yeah.
[01:09:59.720 --> 01:10:01.880]   Oh, I thought you could see like inside the car.
[01:10:01.880 --> 01:10:02.400]   Wow.
[01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:04.680]   No, you can when you see a car go by.
[01:10:04.680 --> 01:10:07.120]   And I was showing John this morning,
[01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:09.200]   there was a mailbox with a crow on it.
[01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:11.520]   The crow was riling, really bright white.
[01:10:11.520 --> 01:10:13.520]   Because it was hot.
[01:10:13.520 --> 01:10:15.120]   Isn't that funny?
[01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:16.560]   Those crows in their body temperature.
[01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:17.240]   They're hot.
[01:10:17.240 --> 01:10:18.480]   That's crazy.
[01:10:18.480 --> 01:10:21.280]   So you would see the deer, but it doesn't outline it yet in green.
[01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:23.000]   That's next year.
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000]   It does outline humans in green and babies.
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:27.920]   One of the things in the Google driving car store,
[01:10:27.920 --> 01:10:29.600]   he said, oh, there must be a bug in it.
[01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:31.080]   And then it realized it was slowing down
[01:10:31.080 --> 01:10:33.200]   because they were deer walking on the side of the worker.
[01:10:33.200 --> 01:10:33.320]   Wow.
[01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:34.320]   See, that's so great.
[01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:35.560]   See, he hadn't seen.
[01:10:35.560 --> 01:10:36.000]   Yeah.
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.080]   The car was like, yeah, something's moving there.
[01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:39.840]   I'm going down to doing down so they'd
[01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:41.120]   eat, jump out in front of me.
[01:10:41.120 --> 01:10:41.760]   Yeah.
[01:10:41.760 --> 01:10:42.320]   Good article.
[01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:43.600]   Auto-correct.
[01:10:43.600 --> 01:10:46.720]   Burkhardt, Bill Ger, it's in this week's New Yorker.
[01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:47.240]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:47.840]   I just closed it.
[01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:48.840]   Sorry.
[01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:50.360]   Chad pulled it up and I just closed it.
[01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:55.080]   Maybe this is related to the Google barge.
[01:10:55.080 --> 01:10:57.120]   I don't know.
[01:10:57.120 --> 01:11:01.640]   Google has opened the Winter Wonder Lab pop-up shop,
[01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:03.800]   showcasing the latest gadgets.
[01:11:03.800 --> 01:11:07.200]   These will be in New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Sacramento,
[01:11:07.200 --> 01:11:08.480]   Washington, DC.
[01:11:08.480 --> 01:11:09.960]   And for reasons no one understands
[01:11:09.960 --> 01:11:13.560]   the parameters New Jersey.
[01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:15.560]   Aw, Fort New Jersey.
[01:11:15.560 --> 01:11:18.600]   But really, I mean, I understand New York, Los Angeles, Chicago,
[01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:22.920]   Sacramento, OK, Washington, DC, no San Francisco,
[01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:26.520]   but they do have parameters New Jersey.
[01:11:26.520 --> 01:11:28.640]   These are little pop-up stores.
[01:11:28.640 --> 01:11:31.200]   There's a giant snow globe inside.
[01:11:31.200 --> 01:11:34.120]   It'll shoot slow motion video of you jumping around.
[01:11:37.120 --> 01:11:40.720]   No Google class there, though, which is odd.
[01:11:40.720 --> 01:11:43.320]   But-- and Google-- I mean, what does-- I mean, I guess--
[01:11:43.320 --> 01:11:46.720]   play, create, chill.
[01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:47.920]   This is the slogan.
[01:11:47.920 --> 01:11:49.320]   This holiday season, you're invited
[01:11:49.320 --> 01:11:53.040]   to the Winter Wonder Lab, presented by Google.
[01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:55.240]   Google's getting weirder and weirder.
[01:11:55.240 --> 01:11:56.640]   I know how companies do this a lot.
[01:11:56.640 --> 01:11:58.800]   Like, I see this on campus at UCSD.
[01:11:58.800 --> 01:12:00.880]   There are like Samsung pop-up things
[01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:02.960]   that they set out, like, in the middle of campus,
[01:12:02.960 --> 01:12:05.360]   and this is where I've seen Nokia, where you just go,
[01:12:05.360 --> 01:12:06.360]   and you play with the gadgets.
[01:12:06.360 --> 01:12:11.000]   I think this is just Google, you know, selling their stuff.
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:12.240]   They're stepping up to this.
[01:12:12.240 --> 01:12:14.240]   If Apple has been doing this for 25 years--
[01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:15.680]   Yeah, Apple does it really well.
[01:12:15.680 --> 01:12:17.400]   And they'll show Nexus 5s.
[01:12:17.400 --> 01:12:19.120]   They'll show Nexus 7s.
[01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:21.120]   And then these are people playing in the snow globe
[01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:23.280]   and the little slow motion videos.
[01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:24.360]   That snow is not real.
[01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:26.080]   It's superimposed on you, so you don't
[01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:29.360]   have to worry about getting wet.
[01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:30.040]   The Winter Wonder Lab.
[01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:32.200]   I hope that it's used to sort of partnership with Zipcar
[01:12:32.200 --> 01:12:35.560]   or some sort of rental car and have it
[01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:37.800]   so that people can try out one of the driverless drivers
[01:12:37.800 --> 01:12:38.720]   of this car this Saturday.
[01:12:38.720 --> 01:12:41.720]   I like to try one of this car for a day.
[01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:42.600]   Just to try it out.
[01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:45.200]   Now you're talking.
[01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:46.600]   I like it.
[01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:53.280]   Anything else here?
[01:12:53.280 --> 01:12:58.720]   Google+ and YouTube integration?
[01:12:58.720 --> 01:13:00.000]   Yeah, we have talked about that.
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:01.440]   But let's talk about it some more.
[01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:03.280]   Really annoys some people.
[01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:05.720]   It really upsets a lot of people.
[01:13:05.720 --> 01:13:10.360]   You have to now have a Google+ account to comment on a YouTube
[01:13:10.360 --> 01:13:10.920]   video.
[01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:13.600]   To post on YouTube video, it has to be tied to your Google+
[01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:15.160]   account.
[01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:17.160]   So there's a collision of things going on here.
[01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:20.680]   So one is it is actually impressive to make YouTube comments
[01:13:20.680 --> 01:13:21.080]   worse.
[01:13:21.080 --> 01:13:22.640]   That's a--
[01:13:22.640 --> 01:13:25.040]   But are they worse, really?
[01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:28.440]   So what I've seen the complaint--
[01:13:28.440 --> 01:13:30.120]   I've seen different complaints from different people
[01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:32.880]   of what's a lot of these as well as very funny,
[01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:34.360]   squairy videos about it.
[01:13:34.360 --> 01:13:34.960]   But--
[01:13:34.960 --> 01:13:36.200]   Yeah, the videos have gotten worse.
[01:13:36.200 --> 01:13:37.960]   But the comments have gotten better.
[01:13:37.960 --> 01:13:41.560]   So my sense is there are three separate complaints here.
[01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:42.160]   There may be four.
[01:13:42.160 --> 01:13:43.960]   But I'll give you three that I've seen.
[01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:47.840]   One is you're now requiring me to use Google+
[01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:50.560]   and therefore you're hitting the fake names,
[01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:52.000]   Ellis Island policy, which means
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:55.600]   that you have to have a name that looks like a name to some
[01:13:55.600 --> 01:13:58.600]   robot at Google, which if you're a YouTube person who
[01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:01.840]   works in a recutinim, is a pain in the neck.
[01:14:01.840 --> 01:14:04.160]   So the publishers, that's painful for them.
[01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:06.720]   But it's also painful for someone to comment, especially
[01:14:06.720 --> 01:14:09.160]   when it sometimes logs you in without you realizing.
[01:14:09.160 --> 01:14:11.720]   And I've seen that people complain about that.
[01:14:11.720 --> 01:14:13.920]   Because they're already logged into Google,
[01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:15.680]   suddenly YouTube and their Google+ accounts are linked
[01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:18.480]   and they weren't expecting it.
[01:14:18.480 --> 01:14:23.360]   So there's that issue, which is the Google now names issue
[01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:25.360]   that we can--
[01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:28.960]   I think is misguided, but we're not going to convince them.
[01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:30.480]   So there's that piece of it.
[01:14:30.480 --> 01:14:36.080]   There's also-- it is now--
[01:14:36.080 --> 01:14:38.800]   it is trying to sensibly sort the response,
[01:14:38.800 --> 01:14:41.680]   the comment responses, so that you see comments from people
[01:14:41.680 --> 01:14:44.880]   you know first and does other prioritization stuff.
[01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:45.880]   That's a little weird.
[01:14:45.880 --> 01:14:46.360]   I agree.
[01:14:46.360 --> 01:14:48.600]   That should probably be chronological.
[01:14:48.600 --> 01:14:51.080]   No, I just-- I think that's not sensible.
[01:14:51.080 --> 01:14:54.200]   There is a setting, by the way, top comments or newest first.
[01:14:54.200 --> 01:14:57.800]   So you can say, just give me the newest comments.
[01:14:57.800 --> 01:14:58.280]   Right.
[01:14:58.280 --> 01:15:01.120]   But part-- well, I want--
[01:15:01.120 --> 01:15:04.360]   I said this to the YouTube guys four years ago,
[01:15:04.360 --> 01:15:06.640]   when I was working there, your comments are toxic
[01:15:06.640 --> 01:15:08.960]   and you need to sort them chronologically
[01:15:08.960 --> 01:15:11.120]   and show different things to different people.
[01:15:11.120 --> 01:15:12.360]   And they're starting to do that,
[01:15:12.360 --> 01:15:13.720]   but they haven't quite got it right yet.
[01:15:13.720 --> 01:15:17.520]   Because part of the problem is they are overweighting comments
[01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:21.280]   that draw reaction, which means they're amplifying the trolls.
[01:15:21.280 --> 01:15:25.440]   So some of the troll come and they're amplifying the trolls
[01:15:25.440 --> 01:15:29.320]   who have built up a following on Google+,
[01:15:29.320 --> 01:15:31.200]   independent of the following on YouTube.
[01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:34.680]   So that means that if there's a set of people who have
[01:15:34.680 --> 01:15:36.600]   their own little chat group on Google+,
[01:15:36.600 --> 01:15:40.760]   and therefore have whatever they use for karma over there,
[01:15:40.760 --> 01:15:42.840]   and then they comment on a YouTube video,
[01:15:42.840 --> 01:15:44.240]   then that will pop up to the top.
[01:15:44.240 --> 01:15:47.520]   And that makes it problematic for the YouTube times.
[01:15:47.520 --> 01:15:52.000]   But I think the bigger complaint from the YouTube publishers
[01:15:52.000 --> 01:15:53.760]   is that they don't feel they've got enough control
[01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:54.360]   over the comments.
[01:15:54.360 --> 01:15:55.920]   And that's a more structural problem.
[01:15:55.920 --> 01:15:59.560]   So I think the way for Google to really improve
[01:15:59.560 --> 01:16:03.080]   YouTube comment quality would be to encourage the people
[01:16:03.080 --> 01:16:06.040]   who are posting videos to help them police it
[01:16:06.040 --> 01:16:08.040]   and give them tools that do that better.
[01:16:08.040 --> 01:16:10.720]   And I haven't got the sense that that's been part of this
[01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:11.720]   release at all.
[01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:13.360]   And hopefully they'll improve that in future.
[01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:15.880]   But Google's first default response is,
[01:16:15.880 --> 01:16:17.720]   we will sort these with an algorithm.
[01:16:17.720 --> 01:16:19.960]   We will help humans do it.
[01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:23.480]   I think there's those are three bits.
[01:16:23.480 --> 01:16:26.240]   The three different strands of things going on there.
[01:16:26.240 --> 01:16:29.800]   And there's different-- you get different complaints about it.
[01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:36.040]   There's 112,000 signatures on the petition.
[01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:37.600]   201,000 now.
[01:16:37.600 --> 01:16:38.520]   Oh.
[01:16:38.520 --> 01:16:39.880]   Since that was written.
[01:16:39.880 --> 01:16:41.440]   Oh, wow.
[01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:43.000]   Yeah, you go to the change.org.
[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.040]   Oddly enough, this is at change.org, which
[01:16:45.040 --> 01:16:47.040]   is normally a political change.
[01:16:47.040 --> 01:16:48.040]   Yeah.
[01:16:48.040 --> 01:16:50.200]   Yeah.
[01:16:50.200 --> 01:16:52.760]   I don't know what this does.
[01:16:52.760 --> 01:16:55.200]   It did surpass the--
[01:16:55.200 --> 01:16:57.480]   or no, it hasn't yet surpassed the 300,000 mark.
[01:16:57.480 --> 01:17:00.320]   What happens at 300,000?
[01:17:00.320 --> 01:17:01.440]   It says 9,000.
[01:17:01.440 --> 01:17:02.800]   Yeah, I don't know what happens.
[01:17:02.800 --> 01:17:03.840]   I mean, ironically--
[01:17:03.840 --> 01:17:04.840]   Google will do it.
[01:17:04.840 --> 01:17:05.360]   This petition--
[01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:06.680]   We're going to go back up a couple of them.
[01:17:06.680 --> 01:17:09.800]   --and email address and street address when you sign it.
[01:17:09.800 --> 01:17:10.800]   Right.
[01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:12.880]   If you scroll back up, you can point out
[01:17:12.880 --> 01:17:15.160]   how many typos there are in there.
[01:17:15.160 --> 01:17:17.440]   How many times do they spell petition?
[01:17:17.440 --> 01:17:18.040]   Wrong.
[01:17:18.040 --> 01:17:19.040]   Pity-nion.
[01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:20.400]   Pity-nion?
[01:17:20.400 --> 01:17:21.400]   Here's your pity-nion.
[01:17:21.400 --> 01:17:23.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:17:23.400 --> 01:17:25.040]   So I have--
[01:17:25.040 --> 01:17:27.160]   I just want to get here, I have sympathy
[01:17:27.160 --> 01:17:31.320]   for both sides of this, because YouTube comments
[01:17:31.320 --> 01:17:35.080]   have been hideous for years.
[01:17:35.080 --> 01:17:37.040]   And they do need to improve.
[01:17:37.040 --> 01:17:40.280]   And what they've learned at Google+ could do that.
[01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:43.280]   But at the same time, it's very helpful
[01:17:43.280 --> 01:17:45.760]   to build up an understanding of how things work.
[01:17:45.760 --> 01:17:48.640]   The other-- the fourth complaint, I think,
[01:17:48.640 --> 01:17:53.960]   is that the subscription model of which videos you see next
[01:17:53.960 --> 01:17:56.960]   has gone all fuzzy and is used in Google+ algorithm.
[01:17:56.960 --> 01:17:59.320]   And the YouTubers who were used to how that worked
[01:17:59.320 --> 01:18:02.680]   are now grumpy because all the SEOs changed, which is--
[01:18:02.680 --> 01:18:03.560]   that's like--
[01:18:03.560 --> 01:18:05.360]   Well, working with Google.
[01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:08.720]   But also, one of their fair points
[01:18:08.720 --> 01:18:12.160]   is that the subscription model on YouTube
[01:18:12.160 --> 01:18:16.360]   was would at least be like Google Reader was,
[01:18:16.360 --> 01:18:18.400]   in that if I subscribe to a channel on YouTube,
[01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:20.120]   but I next log into YouTube and you post it something,
[01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:21.480]   it'll be at the top.
[01:18:21.480 --> 01:18:23.840]   And there's no longer any idea where that might show up
[01:18:23.840 --> 01:18:24.320]   at all.
[01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:26.360]   And you'll be showing other random things instead.
[01:18:26.360 --> 01:18:30.440]   And that is-- for someone who's posting videos regularly
[01:18:30.440 --> 01:18:32.520]   or worse, if they post them irregularly,
[01:18:32.520 --> 01:18:35.360]   they suddenly find that people don't know
[01:18:35.360 --> 01:18:36.240]   they posted a new one.
[01:18:36.240 --> 01:18:38.440]   And they have to find other ways to tell them, which
[01:18:38.440 --> 01:18:42.000]   is kind of kind of productive from their point of view,
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:45.960]   and possibly not helpful from Google's point of view.
[01:18:45.960 --> 01:18:46.320]   I'm sorry.
[01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:47.840]   I was watching the back kid video.
[01:18:47.840 --> 01:18:50.720]   I got distracted.
[01:18:50.720 --> 01:18:52.160]   Only in San Francisco.
[01:18:52.160 --> 01:18:54.360]   I love this.
[01:18:54.360 --> 01:18:57.440]   A five-year-old who has been battling leukemia much
[01:18:57.440 --> 01:19:01.920]   of his life, Miles Scott, said his dream was to be
[01:19:01.920 --> 01:19:03.080]   bat kid for a day.
[01:19:03.080 --> 01:19:04.120]   Make a wish.
[01:19:04.120 --> 01:19:06.280]   Made it come true in San Francisco.
[01:19:06.280 --> 01:19:08.200]   Tens of thousands of people showed up
[01:19:08.200 --> 01:19:12.320]   on the streets of San Francisco to watch him save a woman
[01:19:12.320 --> 01:19:14.240]   from a trolley car track.
[01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:16.520]   And I mean, look at all these people.
[01:19:16.520 --> 01:19:19.520]   And there's the little bat kid in his little bat outfit.
[01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:23.200]   There she is.
[01:19:23.200 --> 01:19:27.320]   This damsel in distress, he saves her on the trolley car track.
[01:19:27.320 --> 01:19:29.520]   And what a cute story that is.
[01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:31.040]   I don't know.
[01:19:31.040 --> 01:19:32.920]   If it wasn't for the damsel in distress thing,
[01:19:32.920 --> 01:19:34.480]   that would be really cute.
[01:19:34.480 --> 01:19:35.760]   OK, the damsel in the start.
[01:19:35.760 --> 01:19:37.120]   All right, I admit.
[01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:38.120]   What is that?
[01:19:38.120 --> 01:19:38.560]   That's really--
[01:19:38.560 --> 01:19:39.560]   It's Batman.
[01:19:39.560 --> 01:19:40.960]   It's got to be here.
[01:19:40.960 --> 01:19:42.320]   Here they are at Paxville Park.
[01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:44.160]   There's got to be a woman in trouble on trolley tracks
[01:19:44.160 --> 01:19:45.160]   somewhere.
[01:19:45.160 --> 01:19:47.920]   It happens when it's 1960s Batman.
[01:19:47.920 --> 01:19:48.560]   That's what it is.
[01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:51.960]   Snidely whiplash ties them up, puts them on the railroad track.
[01:19:51.960 --> 01:19:52.960]   It happens.
[01:19:52.960 --> 01:19:55.800]   There was even a special San Francisco Chronicle edition
[01:19:55.800 --> 01:19:57.840]   bat kid saves city.
[01:19:57.840 --> 01:19:59.640]   It said the Gotham City Chronicle.
[01:19:59.640 --> 01:20:03.640]   They transformed the city of San Francisco for the day.
[01:20:03.640 --> 01:20:05.560]   And social media went crazy.
[01:20:05.560 --> 01:20:07.680]   And there's the Joker.
[01:20:07.680 --> 01:20:10.600]   He got him too.
[01:20:10.600 --> 01:20:12.000]   Obviously, what's interesting for me
[01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:15.040]   is this is 1960s TV Batman.
[01:20:15.040 --> 01:20:16.040]   Oh, yeah.
[01:20:16.040 --> 01:20:17.040]   It's not--
[01:20:17.040 --> 01:20:19.960]   Maybe the 1980s movies is the Dark Knight.
[01:20:19.960 --> 01:20:22.120]   And somebody did--
[01:20:22.120 --> 01:20:27.440]   I think I just put the link in the chat room, which is,
[01:20:27.440 --> 01:20:29.600]   meanwhile, a bane kid lurks in the shadows,
[01:20:29.600 --> 01:20:30.440]   biting his time.
[01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:38.840]   I want to be bane kid.
[01:20:38.840 --> 01:20:43.040]   And a picture of a total ruin in a bane costume.
[01:20:43.040 --> 01:20:46.200]   According to the Chronicle, the costs to San Francisco
[01:20:46.200 --> 01:20:51.480]   for the bat kid shenanigans, $105,000.
[01:20:51.480 --> 01:20:54.840]   However, don't be a scrooge.
[01:20:54.840 --> 01:20:57.040]   They made much more than that, and goodwill.
[01:20:57.040 --> 01:21:00.760]   Right.
[01:21:00.760 --> 01:21:02.440]   Of all the things San Francisco weighs money on that,
[01:21:02.440 --> 01:21:03.240]   that's a--
[01:21:03.240 --> 01:21:06.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:21:06.400 --> 01:21:09.760]   A minor, minor detail.
[01:21:09.760 --> 01:21:11.200]   That was pretty cute.
[01:21:11.200 --> 01:21:11.880]   Yeah.
[01:21:11.880 --> 01:21:17.280]   It was one of the strangest stories I've ever seen.
[01:21:17.280 --> 01:21:19.960]   Anything else that we want to talk about before we get to our tool
[01:21:19.960 --> 01:21:23.280]   and tip and number and all of that stuff?
[01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:25.480]   I think we've got most of the big stories.
[01:21:25.480 --> 01:21:28.760]   It's just now the little crunchy pieces
[01:21:28.760 --> 01:21:31.120]   at the bottom of the Pringles can.
[01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:33.920]   Yeah, the Wolfram programming language is kind of interesting.
[01:21:33.920 --> 01:21:34.400]   OK.
[01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:36.680]   I want to ask you about that, because you're a programmer.
[01:21:36.680 --> 01:21:37.680]   That's true of this.
[01:21:37.680 --> 01:21:38.760]   Actually, you both programs.
[01:21:38.760 --> 01:21:40.560]   This seemed very interesting.
[01:21:40.560 --> 01:21:43.840]   Stephen Wolfram, who is definitely an iconic class,
[01:21:43.840 --> 01:21:47.600]   and created Mathematica, and more recently Wolfram Alpha,
[01:21:47.600 --> 01:21:50.880]   announced that they're going to have a special, high, very high-level
[01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:54.000]   programming language, much like the language in Mathematica,
[01:21:54.000 --> 01:22:00.560]   that will allow people to create kind of real-world models
[01:22:00.560 --> 01:22:02.200]   with information from Wolfram Alpha.
[01:22:02.200 --> 01:22:05.320]   I guess this is what they've been using internally.
[01:22:05.320 --> 01:22:07.040]   Tell me what you know about this.
[01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:08.400]   This is intriguing.
[01:22:08.400 --> 01:22:09.960]   Yeah, this is pretty intriguing.
[01:22:09.960 --> 01:22:13.320]   So it looks like the point of the language
[01:22:13.320 --> 01:22:17.560]   is to make it really easy to do very complex tasks.
[01:22:17.560 --> 01:22:21.360]   Kind of what you see at the Wolfram Alpha, the search engine.
[01:22:21.360 --> 01:22:24.080]   You can do very easy image processing, making graphs,
[01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:26.800]   understanding natural language.
[01:22:26.800 --> 01:22:29.520]   And so Wolfram said it becomes trivial to write a program that
[01:22:29.520 --> 01:22:32.840]   makes you the latest stock price, computes the next high tide,
[01:22:32.840 --> 01:22:35.680]   generates a street map, shows an image of a type of airplane,
[01:22:35.680 --> 01:22:37.640]   or a zillion other things.
[01:22:37.640 --> 01:22:41.240]   That sounds really, really, really interesting.
[01:22:41.240 --> 01:22:45.560]   I mean, this is the kind of thing that platforms like Android or iOS
[01:22:45.560 --> 01:22:47.720]   try to provide these tools to programmers.
[01:22:47.720 --> 01:22:51.080]   But this is very high-level stuff that we're talking about here.
[01:22:51.080 --> 01:22:53.560]   So I mean, of course, my first questions
[01:22:53.560 --> 01:22:56.280]   are, where is this going to run?
[01:22:56.280 --> 01:22:57.080]   Is this just going to be--
[01:22:57.080 --> 01:22:59.280]   Well, they say you can build standalone apps
[01:22:59.280 --> 01:23:01.760]   desktop apps so you can compile it.
[01:23:01.760 --> 01:23:03.840]   But they also are going to do a cloud engine,
[01:23:03.840 --> 01:23:09.720]   an app engine style cloud, so you can deploy over the web.
[01:23:09.720 --> 01:23:12.960]   I mean, the challenge is that it's
[01:23:12.960 --> 01:23:15.320]   going to be locked up inside mathematical land.
[01:23:15.320 --> 01:23:17.960]   Your mathematics is a very powerful language,
[01:23:17.960 --> 01:23:22.120]   but you have to buy licenses to it from Wolfram to use it.
[01:23:22.120 --> 01:23:24.280]   And so there's been a parallel set of infrastructure
[01:23:24.280 --> 01:23:26.160]   being built with Mount Lab and R and things
[01:23:26.160 --> 01:23:28.760]   that are actually open source that people are using.
[01:23:28.760 --> 01:23:29.600]   Well, that's interesting.
[01:23:29.600 --> 01:23:32.200]   So Mount Lab is open source and free.
[01:23:32.200 --> 01:23:32.960]   Right.
[01:23:32.960 --> 01:23:36.440]   And R is like another toolkit there that's mathematical.
[01:23:36.440 --> 01:23:38.760]   And there's a bunch of--
[01:23:38.760 --> 01:23:43.200]   there's been a sort of renaissance over the last few years
[01:23:43.200 --> 01:23:46.720]   as all the graduate students have discovered open source
[01:23:46.720 --> 01:23:50.360]   in using those tools rather than using the proprietary
[01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:53.360]   stance packages and the proprietary language like Mathematica.
[01:23:53.360 --> 01:23:54.840]   Now, Mathematica is enormously powerful.
[01:23:54.840 --> 01:23:57.280]   And it's wonderfully for you doing high maths
[01:23:57.280 --> 01:24:00.520]   at all, hard maths at all because it lets you do things
[01:24:00.520 --> 01:24:04.480]   that are very, very complex and express them
[01:24:04.480 --> 01:24:06.440]   in a pure mathematical form.
[01:24:06.440 --> 01:24:09.400]   But there are sort of open source things coming alongside it.
[01:24:09.400 --> 01:24:12.200]   So I think the challenge for Wolfram is--
[01:24:12.200 --> 01:24:13.160]   he gets this.
[01:24:13.160 --> 01:24:14.160]   He's a smart guy.
[01:24:14.160 --> 01:24:16.160]   So they've already got their-- what are they called?
[01:24:16.160 --> 01:24:17.840]   CDF or something?
[01:24:17.840 --> 01:24:20.560]   They've got their own format for publishing
[01:24:20.560 --> 01:24:23.520]   Mathematica notebooks that you can then render in other places
[01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:25.120]   and things like that.
[01:24:25.120 --> 01:24:28.280]   But what they're sort of running against
[01:24:28.280 --> 01:24:30.640]   is the sort of open source cluster of tools
[01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:32.200]   that people are starting to put together.
[01:24:32.200 --> 01:24:35.560]   And there's some fairly mature tool sets in Python
[01:24:35.560 --> 01:24:36.560]   that a lot of the--
[01:24:36.560 --> 01:24:38.760]   there's a Python notebooks thing that people now use
[01:24:38.760 --> 01:24:39.840]   to interchange these things.
[01:24:39.840 --> 01:24:41.040]   So they've got some competition.
[01:24:41.040 --> 01:24:42.640]   But it's good to see.
[01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:45.320]   And I'm-- yeah.
[01:24:45.320 --> 01:24:49.280]   If you use Wolfram Alpha, it is extremely powerful and useful.
[01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:49.840]   I found--
[01:24:49.840 --> 01:24:51.920]   A level from Alpha.
[01:24:51.920 --> 01:24:54.360]   It's also like-- my kids, it's like,
[01:24:54.360 --> 01:24:56.320]   hi, I have some homework.
[01:24:56.320 --> 01:24:57.160]   Right.
[01:24:57.160 --> 01:24:58.040]   How do I solve this?
[01:24:58.040 --> 01:25:00.960]   And it's like, well, that's a more closed form solution
[01:25:00.960 --> 01:25:03.600]   that I was expecting for that.
[01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:07.600]   Could you integrate this quadratic equation for me?
[01:25:07.600 --> 01:25:09.960]   Solve for x, please.
[01:25:09.960 --> 01:25:11.520]   OK.
[01:25:11.520 --> 01:25:12.840]   I've never used Mathematica.
[01:25:12.840 --> 01:25:14.560]   Have you used it, Kevin?
[01:25:14.560 --> 01:25:15.560]   I've used it a little.
[01:25:15.560 --> 01:25:17.760]   And it was-- it had a high learning curve.
[01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:19.240]   Because it's an expressive language
[01:25:19.240 --> 01:25:21.800]   that you had to-- it's basically a language
[01:25:21.800 --> 01:25:25.120]   for typing maths in, which means you need to understand
[01:25:25.120 --> 01:25:26.800]   its notation and map that to real notation.
[01:25:26.800 --> 01:25:27.800]   It'll display the real notation.
[01:25:27.800 --> 01:25:28.720]   You have to express it.
[01:25:28.720 --> 01:25:31.840]   He says that this language would be more like Java or C++.
[01:25:31.840 --> 01:25:34.840]   So a much more traditional programming language.
[01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:37.120]   But also, the other thing that's interesting about this
[01:25:37.120 --> 01:25:38.800]   is that the stuff they've run from Wolfram Alpha
[01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:42.640]   is how to integrate existing data sets, things like that.
[01:25:42.640 --> 01:25:44.320]   A big chunk of what they do there
[01:25:44.320 --> 01:25:48.120]   is curate large data sets of information
[01:25:48.120 --> 01:25:50.160]   and then make that accessible to the other pieces.
[01:25:50.160 --> 01:25:55.600]   So that's-- in some ways, it's like the Google mission
[01:25:55.600 --> 01:25:57.240]   of making sense of the world.
[01:25:57.240 --> 01:25:58.760]   But they've got a different take on it,
[01:25:58.760 --> 01:26:01.000]   which is make sense to plug it into something programmable.
[01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.040]   They're trying to build a model, almost.
[01:26:03.040 --> 01:26:03.400]   Yeah.
[01:26:03.400 --> 01:26:05.600]   So that's-- yeah.
[01:26:05.600 --> 01:26:08.600]   If you've-- I mean, it's worth going to Wolfram Alpha
[01:26:08.600 --> 01:26:10.160]   and looking at some of the examples
[01:26:10.160 --> 01:26:11.240]   queries they have down the side.
[01:26:11.240 --> 01:26:12.560]   Because if you just type random things--
[01:26:12.560 --> 01:26:13.360]   I know I love that.
[01:26:13.360 --> 01:26:13.720]   Yeah.
[01:26:13.720 --> 01:26:14.920]   It never quite understands you.
[01:26:14.920 --> 01:26:19.200]   But if you think in the way it expects you to think,
[01:26:19.200 --> 01:26:21.840]   which is in a very sort of physicist way,
[01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:24.840]   because that's what he is, it will come back
[01:26:24.840 --> 01:26:26.320]   with useful things for you.
[01:26:26.320 --> 01:26:29.320]   So if you want to understand the pension equation,
[01:26:29.320 --> 01:26:30.520]   and you search for that in there,
[01:26:30.520 --> 01:26:33.240]   it'll give you the first approximation
[01:26:33.240 --> 01:26:36.640]   you use in high school, and then the second solution
[01:26:36.640 --> 01:26:37.720]   that hits for Angular.
[01:26:37.720 --> 01:26:38.680]   And they say, oh, and it's actually
[01:26:38.680 --> 01:26:40.360]   a two-dimensional object, and this happens too.
[01:26:40.360 --> 01:26:44.800]   And it'll take you into the depth of the math that's
[01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:45.920]   underpinning all this.
[01:26:45.920 --> 01:26:52.120]   So it is a very sort of powerful tool for drawing you in.
[01:26:52.120 --> 01:26:55.440]   So yeah, I'm excited by this, but I'm also
[01:26:55.440 --> 01:26:58.000]   as excited by the sort of parallel thing that's
[01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:01.920]   going on in the open source world that plugs into some
[01:27:01.920 --> 01:27:04.400]   of this, that plugs into some of the same idea,
[01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:06.720]   and having stuff move back and forth between them.
[01:27:06.720 --> 01:27:13.520]   There's also-- and we talked about this too--
[01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:17.240]   a new programming environment called LiveCode.
[01:27:17.240 --> 01:27:20.320]   I might as well throw this in as last we're talking about it.
[01:27:20.320 --> 01:27:24.680]   The idea is it's a cross-platform programming language.
[01:27:24.680 --> 01:27:25.800]   Is that right?
[01:27:25.800 --> 01:27:26.320]   Why?
[01:27:26.320 --> 01:27:26.600]   I'm so--
[01:27:26.600 --> 01:27:27.760]   What was that?
[01:27:27.760 --> 01:27:30.920]   LiveCode.com.
[01:27:30.920 --> 01:27:33.840]   This was, I think, a Kickstarter.
[01:27:33.840 --> 01:27:39.960]   And it's designed to do completely cross-platform app,
[01:27:39.960 --> 01:27:42.840]   which there's a lot of those out there.
[01:27:42.840 --> 01:27:48.920]   And I'm trying to remember what was unique about this.
[01:27:48.920 --> 01:27:52.080]   It's a Scottish company.
[01:27:52.080 --> 01:27:53.560]   It uses a visual workflow.
[01:27:53.560 --> 01:27:54.240]   It's not free.
[01:27:54.240 --> 01:27:55.560]   It's not open source.
[01:27:55.560 --> 01:27:58.080]   So maybe it's not even worse.
[01:27:58.080 --> 01:28:01.040]   So is it some variant of--
[01:28:01.040 --> 01:28:01.840]   I don't know.
[01:28:01.840 --> 01:28:04.800]   Is it that kind of style?
[01:28:04.800 --> 01:28:05.880]   It's a visual workflow.
[01:28:05.880 --> 01:28:11.560]   It's used-- the company is committed to promoting digital
[01:28:11.560 --> 01:28:13.040]   literacy schools using the platform
[01:28:13.040 --> 01:28:17.120]   who've seen a doubling of uptake for their CS courses.
[01:28:17.120 --> 01:28:20.240]   Why did we talk about it on security now?
[01:28:20.240 --> 01:28:25.680]   I think it was-- or I mean on a twit.
[01:28:25.680 --> 01:28:28.560]   You created an iOS Android app in three hours and 16 minutes.
[01:28:28.560 --> 01:28:31.040]   They've got a sped up panel video.
[01:28:31.040 --> 01:28:33.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:28:33.040 --> 01:28:38.320]   Anyway, what-- and since you guys are programmers,
[01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:40.360]   I thought by now we were supposed to not
[01:28:40.360 --> 01:28:43.040]   have to worry about programming languages anymore.
[01:28:43.040 --> 01:28:46.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:28:46.520 --> 01:28:47.520]   It's not.
[01:28:47.520 --> 01:28:48.520]   It's not.
[01:28:48.520 --> 01:28:49.040]   Yes.
[01:28:49.040 --> 01:28:50.560]   It's not.
[01:28:50.560 --> 01:28:52.360]   Well, this was going to be a hypercard replacement.
[01:28:52.360 --> 01:28:54.240]   That's why we talked about it.
[01:28:54.240 --> 01:28:59.400]   Yeah, it looks-- we've had different variations of these.
[01:28:59.400 --> 01:29:01.440]   Hypercard was a very good example of this.
[01:29:01.440 --> 01:29:05.600]   So hypercard let you construct forms, effectively, buttons,
[01:29:05.600 --> 01:29:08.560]   fields, and images--
[01:29:08.560 --> 01:29:10.640]   one bit images originally--
[01:29:10.640 --> 01:29:13.360]   and plug them together and add a scripting language underneath
[01:29:13.360 --> 01:29:15.920]   that was actually fairly well put together.
[01:29:15.920 --> 01:29:18.360]   And we've seen iterations of things like that over time.
[01:29:18.360 --> 01:29:19.520]   Scratch is another good example.
[01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:23.160]   Scratch is a project from MIT, I think,
[01:29:23.160 --> 01:29:26.080]   that lets you build programs by plugging things that are like
[01:29:26.080 --> 01:29:28.040]   jigsaw pieces together to take loops and so on,
[01:29:28.040 --> 01:29:32.040]   and attach them to sprites on the screen and move them about.
[01:29:32.040 --> 01:29:34.160]   And it would generate a Java program,
[01:29:34.160 --> 01:29:35.480]   which was a good idea at the time.
[01:29:35.480 --> 01:29:36.920]   And they've now done an iteration of it.
[01:29:36.920 --> 01:29:39.200]   It's a web app.
[01:29:39.200 --> 01:29:39.720]   So--
[01:29:39.720 --> 01:29:41.560]   I've got an idea at the time.
[01:29:41.560 --> 01:29:43.720]   So they raised nearly half a million pounds
[01:29:43.720 --> 01:29:46.920]   on Kickstarter to do this.
[01:29:46.920 --> 01:29:49.180]   No, it's-- there are lots of these app generator
[01:29:49.180 --> 01:29:49.800]   things around there.
[01:29:49.800 --> 01:29:52.760]   And you find domain-specific ones for doing certain things.
[01:29:52.760 --> 01:29:54.520]   To some extent, you can do--
[01:29:54.520 --> 01:29:58.200]   the original interface builder on Next step was like this.
[01:29:58.200 --> 01:29:59.720]   And that's still there in Xcode.
[01:29:59.720 --> 01:30:00.200]   If you--
[01:30:00.200 --> 01:30:03.400]   Yeah, the courts composer and the Xcode--
[01:30:03.400 --> 01:30:04.160]   You could plug your stuff together.
[01:30:04.160 --> 01:30:04.720]   --enterface designer.
[01:30:04.720 --> 01:30:05.800]   Yeah, I love all that.
[01:30:05.800 --> 01:30:06.160]   Yeah.
[01:30:06.160 --> 01:30:07.440]   And if you add a program, then you have to go and write
[01:30:07.440 --> 01:30:08.440]   the code that joins together.
[01:30:08.440 --> 01:30:10.280]   And then when you want to change it, you're like, oh, now what
[01:30:10.280 --> 01:30:10.640]   I do.
[01:30:10.640 --> 01:30:12.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:30:12.400 --> 01:30:14.120]   And there's the Google one that I've
[01:30:14.120 --> 01:30:17.400]   forgotten the name of that did something similar that
[01:30:17.400 --> 01:30:20.040]   built an Android one, except that it was some--
[01:30:20.040 --> 01:30:20.960]   App indexer.
[01:30:20.960 --> 01:30:21.320]   --wrap.
[01:30:21.320 --> 01:30:22.040]   What was it?
[01:30:22.040 --> 01:30:22.720]   App indexer.
[01:30:22.720 --> 01:30:23.200]   App indexer.
[01:30:23.200 --> 01:30:23.680]   App indexer.
[01:30:23.680 --> 01:30:25.240]   But it was some really strange mixture
[01:30:25.240 --> 01:30:29.920]   of web-based authoring and client-side app that meant you
[01:30:29.920 --> 01:30:32.320]   had to take it through two processes to get it done.
[01:30:32.320 --> 01:30:34.120]   So there's lots of things like this.
[01:30:34.120 --> 01:30:37.280]   And we've seen more of them over time.
[01:30:37.280 --> 01:30:39.640]   And part of this is programmers trying to build tools
[01:30:39.640 --> 01:30:41.160]   to make their lives easier.
[01:30:41.160 --> 01:30:43.760]   The other examples of these are things like rails
[01:30:43.760 --> 01:30:47.160]   and the app generators like that, where you say, well,
[01:30:47.160 --> 01:30:49.120]   if you make a database, we'll generate your web page that
[01:30:49.120 --> 01:30:50.280]   reflects that database.
[01:30:50.280 --> 01:30:52.080]   And then it'll give you the framework
[01:30:52.080 --> 01:30:54.080]   to make some of this stuff easier.
[01:30:54.080 --> 01:30:55.080]   Right, the scaffolding.
[01:30:55.080 --> 01:30:58.240]   And there's a lot of these scaffolding bits and pieces.
[01:30:58.240 --> 01:30:59.600]   That's where we're putting it.
[01:30:59.600 --> 01:31:03.320]   But it's also creating transducers between things.
[01:31:03.320 --> 01:31:06.960]   And part of this is we've got better at actually decoupling
[01:31:06.960 --> 01:31:08.480]   some of these components from each other,
[01:31:08.480 --> 01:31:10.720]   making it-- we've got better patterns
[01:31:10.720 --> 01:31:12.880]   for moving stuff back and forth between different programming
[01:31:12.880 --> 01:31:15.080]   languages and different data stores and things like that
[01:31:15.080 --> 01:31:16.440]   that's enabling a lot of these things.
[01:31:16.440 --> 01:31:19.520]   So if this then that is an example of that,
[01:31:19.520 --> 01:31:21.800]   where they're saying, OK, we've built transducers
[01:31:21.800 --> 01:31:23.040]   between these sets of things.
[01:31:23.040 --> 01:31:25.520]   But they can do that because those APIs exist.
[01:31:25.520 --> 01:31:27.200]   And the challenge is always, at some point,
[01:31:27.200 --> 01:31:29.480]   you've got to actually think about logic,
[01:31:29.480 --> 01:31:32.520]   and you've got to think about layout and user experience.
[01:31:32.520 --> 01:31:37.880]   And that's still harder to automate and simplify away.
[01:31:37.880 --> 01:31:42.240]   But it's all to the good from my point of view.
[01:31:42.240 --> 01:31:45.600]   As long as you're not-- the challenge with all these things
[01:31:45.600 --> 01:31:50.720]   is if you build something that is completely in its own world,
[01:31:50.720 --> 01:31:53.120]   then you're stuck in that world.
[01:31:53.120 --> 01:31:55.680]   And like any framework, once you've adopted that framework,
[01:31:55.680 --> 01:31:57.400]   it's bringing all of it with it.
[01:31:57.400 --> 01:31:59.480]   And if it's built that way, then you will suddenly
[01:31:59.480 --> 01:32:02.000]   find leaky abstractions in there.
[01:32:02.000 --> 01:32:03.400]   And something really weird will happen.
[01:32:03.400 --> 01:32:05.080]   And then you have no idea what to do,
[01:32:05.080 --> 01:32:08.080]   except either call the guy who wrote it or sit there and debug
[01:32:08.080 --> 01:32:10.080]   yourself all the way down to the metal and get it fixed.
[01:32:10.080 --> 01:32:11.960]   And that's the tension with this.
[01:32:11.960 --> 01:32:14.760]   So the challenge with getting these things right
[01:32:14.760 --> 01:32:18.840]   is getting the surface area between them,
[01:32:18.840 --> 01:32:20.880]   the place where they overlap smooth enough
[01:32:20.880 --> 01:32:22.360]   that you can plug them together well.
[01:32:22.360 --> 01:32:26.080]   And that's the interesting, hard part
[01:32:26.080 --> 01:32:29.640]   of programming design these days.
[01:32:29.640 --> 01:32:35.400]   Are we still agile programming, test-driven design,
[01:32:35.400 --> 01:32:38.280]   object model controller, all of that stuff?
[01:32:38.280 --> 01:32:40.600]   Is that still--
[01:32:40.600 --> 01:32:42.080]   I don't think-- I mean, with all of those things
[01:32:42.080 --> 01:32:44.720]   that you just mentioned, well, NBC, Model View Controller,
[01:32:44.720 --> 01:32:46.120]   that's a design pattern.
[01:32:46.120 --> 01:32:47.960]   Agile is a way to manage your project.
[01:32:47.960 --> 01:32:50.400]   I mean, those are sort of more abstract theories
[01:32:50.400 --> 01:32:52.400]   about the best way to approach software development.
[01:32:52.400 --> 01:32:54.280]   And I think those are all really useful.
[01:32:54.280 --> 01:32:57.600]   In fact, NPR just did a thing about healthcare.gov
[01:32:57.600 --> 01:33:00.480]   and how the waterfall approach versus the agile approach,
[01:33:00.480 --> 01:33:02.000]   which is a really, really good article.
[01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:03.320]   I think that makes a lot of sense.
[01:33:03.320 --> 01:33:05.000]   They use the waterfall approach?
[01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.280]   Yeah, they use the waterfall approach, which is--
[01:33:07.280 --> 01:33:08.920]   the sort of traditional--
[01:33:08.920 --> 01:33:10.720]   here's this giant set of requirements.
[01:33:10.720 --> 01:33:12.240]   Programmers go away somewhere.
[01:33:12.240 --> 01:33:14.600]   And three months from now, they present you
[01:33:14.600 --> 01:33:17.720]   a complete and fully built system.
[01:33:17.720 --> 01:33:22.280]   Whereas agile is more of an iterative mini sprint
[01:33:22.280 --> 01:33:24.240]   with deliverables and requirements that
[01:33:24.240 --> 01:33:25.760]   change the route kind of approach.
[01:33:25.760 --> 01:33:27.800]   That's all really useful.
[01:33:27.800 --> 01:33:30.440]   And design patterns like Model View Controller,
[01:33:30.440 --> 01:33:31.960]   which is what rails is.
[01:33:31.960 --> 01:33:33.920]   I mean, you have frameworks that are built sort of
[01:33:33.920 --> 01:33:36.640]   around those design patterns.
[01:33:36.640 --> 01:33:39.560]   Those are all really useful to know
[01:33:39.560 --> 01:33:43.120]   and just different approaches to structuring your app.
[01:33:43.120 --> 01:33:45.360]   But yeah, Kevin's point about frameworks.
[01:33:45.360 --> 01:33:48.560]   He was like, I wrote my own NBC framework,
[01:33:48.560 --> 01:33:52.640]   which is not something that a lot of programmers want to do.
[01:33:52.640 --> 01:33:54.080]   Force think up.
[01:33:54.080 --> 01:33:57.600]   Yeah, conventional advice is that you don't reinvent the wheel
[01:33:57.600 --> 01:33:59.280]   or rewrite a thing that exists.
[01:33:59.280 --> 01:34:02.320]   I mean, there's plenty of rails as NBC, code igniter,
[01:34:02.320 --> 01:34:03.520]   for PHP as NBC.
[01:34:03.520 --> 01:34:06.080]   But I wrote my own because like Kevin said,
[01:34:06.080 --> 01:34:07.400]   when you adopt someone else's framework,
[01:34:07.400 --> 01:34:09.240]   you get all the stuff that they built.
[01:34:09.240 --> 01:34:11.240]   And there might be a point where it doesn't do the thing
[01:34:11.240 --> 01:34:13.200]   that you want it to do or there's leaky abstraction
[01:34:13.200 --> 01:34:13.800]   or there's a bug.
[01:34:13.800 --> 01:34:15.360]   And then you're kind of stuck having
[01:34:15.360 --> 01:34:18.200]   to debug this other set of code.
[01:34:18.200 --> 01:34:20.320]   So there's the disadvantages and disadvantages
[01:34:20.320 --> 01:34:22.320]   and disadvantages to both.
[01:34:22.320 --> 01:34:24.000]   It's really frustrating to have a bug
[01:34:24.000 --> 01:34:28.360]   and not know if it's your code or the framework code
[01:34:28.360 --> 01:34:29.560]   or the library code.
[01:34:29.560 --> 01:34:31.200]   We'll talk about this for other bugs.
[01:34:31.200 --> 01:34:32.800]   We'll stack of open source software.
[01:34:32.800 --> 01:34:34.240]   There could be bugs anywhere.
[01:34:34.240 --> 01:34:35.080]   Right.
[01:34:35.080 --> 01:34:36.800]   But at least with this open source, you can debug it.
[01:34:36.800 --> 01:34:39.800]   And that's the piece that's making me a little nervous
[01:34:39.800 --> 01:34:42.400]   about the mathematical thing.
[01:34:42.400 --> 01:34:45.320]   Because I've been in both sides of that problem.
[01:34:45.320 --> 01:34:47.560]   I've been in the place where I've written code
[01:34:47.560 --> 01:34:50.640]   against an operating system or a framework that is closed source.
[01:34:50.640 --> 01:34:53.200]   And then you hit a bug and you're like,
[01:34:53.200 --> 01:34:55.440]   I can send a bug report to Apple or Microsoft.
[01:34:55.440 --> 01:34:57.440]   But then I've got to wait for them to do a ship release.
[01:34:57.440 --> 01:34:59.640]   And in the meantime, I've got to write a workaround for this.
[01:34:59.640 --> 01:35:02.040]   And I don't know when they're going to deal with that.
[01:35:02.040 --> 01:35:03.200]   And that's a structural problem.
[01:35:03.200 --> 01:35:04.960]   Whereas at least it was open source.
[01:35:04.960 --> 01:35:08.640]   A, you can debug your way into it and go, oh, they're doing this thing.
[01:35:08.640 --> 01:35:12.120]   I can patch that myself and I can send a pull request to them
[01:35:12.120 --> 01:35:13.120]   to try and fix it.
[01:35:13.120 --> 01:35:16.840]   So that's one of the reasons that open source wins over time
[01:35:16.840 --> 01:35:20.200]   is that it's much more resilient because you can do that stuff
[01:35:20.200 --> 01:35:22.720]   and propagate the variations on a team to it.
[01:35:22.720 --> 01:35:27.800]   So that's kind of what I was getting at with talking about the mathematical stuff.
[01:35:27.800 --> 01:35:29.400]   But it's true of the frameworks as well.
[01:35:29.400 --> 01:35:34.680]   And one of the metrics people use is how active is this framework
[01:35:34.680 --> 01:35:36.200]   of people actually changing it.
[01:35:36.200 --> 01:35:37.760]   And that can mean two things.
[01:35:37.760 --> 01:35:42.120]   It either means it's very new and it's not fresh yet.
[01:35:42.120 --> 01:35:43.040]   It's not ready yet.
[01:35:43.040 --> 01:35:46.680]   Or it can mean at least people are patching it and paying attention to it.
[01:35:46.680 --> 01:35:50.240]   It isn't frozen in some old model of the world that hasn't changed.
[01:35:50.240 --> 01:35:53.880]   And that's it's a continuous challenge for programmers.
[01:35:53.880 --> 01:35:56.680]   Either so to this.
[01:35:56.680 --> 01:35:59.120]   Leo, speaking of coding, I'm really happy to hear that
[01:35:59.120 --> 01:36:01.920]   the Twit is going to have a coding show in 2014.
[01:36:01.920 --> 01:36:03.160]   Yeah, I'm excited about that.
[01:36:03.160 --> 01:36:04.400]   It will not be at this level.
[01:36:04.400 --> 01:36:07.520]   So relax.
[01:36:07.520 --> 01:36:10.360]   Everybody is going, what?
[01:36:10.360 --> 01:36:13.680]   Yeah, Father Robert Ballester, we're going to take do little,
[01:36:13.680 --> 01:36:16.480]   I think eight week modules with different languages in each module.
[01:36:16.480 --> 01:36:20.240]   So people can find out a little bit about each different kind of language
[01:36:20.240 --> 01:36:22.000]   and basic fundamental concepts.
[01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:23.520]   It's not for its for beginners.
[01:36:23.520 --> 01:36:24.840]   But I think it's going to be a lot of fun.
[01:36:24.840 --> 01:36:28.080]   And we do have some stuff for experts in there too.
[01:36:28.080 --> 01:36:31.960]   I really lobbied for the language of the week so that we could talk about things
[01:36:31.960 --> 01:36:37.320]   like Erlang and Haskell and force and Fortran and whatever.
[01:36:37.320 --> 01:36:38.000]   Yeah, it'll be fun.
[01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:38.760]   That's coming.
[01:36:38.760 --> 01:36:42.880]   I think programming is for me, it was always a wonderful hobby.
[01:36:42.880 --> 01:36:43.560]   I just enjoyed it.
[01:36:43.560 --> 01:36:45.480]   I'm never very good at it.
[01:36:45.480 --> 01:36:47.920]   But it's also very empowering.
[01:36:47.920 --> 01:36:49.840]   And it's not hard.
[01:36:49.840 --> 01:36:51.760]   And it's a good thing to know.
[01:36:51.760 --> 01:36:54.800]   And that's why I was interested in this Wolfram Alpha because I love the idea
[01:36:54.800 --> 01:37:01.680]   of a higher level language that I could use to do one-off things.
[01:37:01.680 --> 01:37:04.200]   Analytics and the like.
[01:37:04.200 --> 01:37:08.280]   Modeling and so forth.
[01:37:08.280 --> 01:37:09.200]   Enough.
[01:37:09.200 --> 01:37:13.360]   Let's find out what we've got for our tool and our tip.
[01:37:13.360 --> 01:37:15.400]   And we're not going to do a number.
[01:37:15.400 --> 01:37:20.600]   Although I'll tell you what, I'll channel Jeff and do a number.
[01:37:20.600 --> 01:37:22.960]   Let's start with Gina's tip of the week.
[01:37:22.960 --> 01:37:27.520]   My tip of the week is actually kind of a set of tips that Life Hacker published.
[01:37:27.520 --> 01:37:30.680]   How to train Google now to give you better suggestions.
[01:37:30.680 --> 01:37:33.640]   And I actually really wish that Jeff was here for this.
[01:37:33.640 --> 01:37:35.520]   I'm going to have to email this to him.
[01:37:35.520 --> 01:37:39.320]   But really, really good article, just a couple of things on how to make Google now better.
[01:37:39.320 --> 01:37:42.320]   One is some simple stuff that's maybe not as obvious.
[01:37:42.320 --> 01:37:46.440]   But if you add an address to an event on your Google calendar, for example, you're going
[01:37:46.440 --> 01:37:51.600]   to get more informational cards about how far away your next event is.
[01:37:51.600 --> 01:37:55.440]   If you search for something online, there's a little "Remind Me" button we've talked about
[01:37:55.440 --> 01:37:56.440]   before.
[01:37:56.440 --> 01:37:59.200]   I was really excited about the new Hunger Games movie coming out.
[01:37:59.200 --> 01:38:02.400]   And I had searched for it a few months back and said, "Hey, remind me when this comes out."
[01:38:02.400 --> 01:38:05.840]   And I just got a Google now card saying, "Hey, you know, that's awesome."
[01:38:05.840 --> 01:38:06.840]   "That's awesome."
[01:38:06.840 --> 01:38:07.840]   "The entire empire is coming out in a week."
[01:38:07.840 --> 01:38:08.840]   And I got my tickets.
[01:38:08.840 --> 01:38:09.840]   I'm so excited.
[01:38:09.840 --> 01:38:13.000]   Yeah, and there's also a magic wand.
[01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:16.480]   This was new to me, a magic wand icon at the bottom of the Google Now settings.
[01:38:16.480 --> 01:38:20.960]   And if you tap on it, you can say, "Here are the sports teams that I care about.
[01:38:20.960 --> 01:38:23.160]   Here are the shows that I care about.
[01:38:23.160 --> 01:38:25.880]   Here are the stock symbols I care about.
[01:38:25.880 --> 01:38:31.160]   And it'll trigger Google Now to give you more information about that stuff."
[01:38:31.160 --> 01:38:34.560]   That was just out of the Google Now update they just did.
[01:38:34.560 --> 01:38:35.560]   Yeah, okay.
[01:38:35.560 --> 01:38:37.200]   So that is just out of it.
[01:38:37.200 --> 01:38:38.200]   Yeah.
[01:38:38.200 --> 01:38:43.240]   So you kind of tell it, "Hey, yes, you tap on that Google wand or the magic wand."
[01:38:43.240 --> 01:38:44.640]   And yeah, customize Google Now.
[01:38:44.640 --> 01:38:46.440]   Sports team stocks, places, and everything else.
[01:38:46.440 --> 01:38:47.760]   You can say, "Hey, this is home.
[01:38:47.760 --> 01:38:48.760]   This is work."
[01:38:48.760 --> 01:38:50.720]   And Google Now will give you more.
[01:38:50.720 --> 01:38:53.760]   You kind of have to do a piecemeal.
[01:38:53.760 --> 01:38:58.120]   So having it all in one page really is handy.
[01:38:58.120 --> 01:38:59.120]   I love Google Now.
[01:38:59.120 --> 01:39:01.200]   I keep waiting for more to happen with it.
[01:39:01.200 --> 01:39:04.200]   So we're right now at team stocks, places.
[01:39:04.200 --> 01:39:07.880]   Everything else is, "Are you interested in commute updates for Dennis Appleton Nielsen?"
[01:39:07.880 --> 01:39:09.880]   No, I don't even know who that is.
[01:39:09.880 --> 01:39:10.880]   Continue.
[01:39:10.880 --> 01:39:13.040]   By the way, that is a feature I don't like.
[01:39:13.040 --> 01:39:19.680]   Apparently, people in your circles somehow can make their commute updates public.
[01:39:19.680 --> 01:39:23.320]   And again, every once in a while I get somebody's commute update.
[01:39:23.320 --> 01:39:24.320]   And I just don't understand.
[01:39:24.320 --> 01:39:26.400]   Yeah, you have a lot more questions there than I do.
[01:39:26.400 --> 01:39:29.160]   Why don't you just, how do you usually get around walking, biking, car?
[01:39:29.160 --> 01:39:31.240]   Are you interested in whether updates for work for home?
[01:39:31.240 --> 01:39:32.240]   Yeah.
[01:39:32.240 --> 01:39:33.240]   Well, you got to tell it where your home is.
[01:39:33.240 --> 01:39:34.240]   It's really important.
[01:39:34.240 --> 01:39:35.480]   I probably shouldn't show this card.
[01:39:35.480 --> 01:39:37.760]   Where your home is and where your work is.
[01:39:37.760 --> 01:39:39.040]   I love this stuff.
[01:39:39.040 --> 01:39:40.680]   I think this is really great.
[01:39:40.680 --> 01:39:46.080]   I love Google Now divine that my work is this coffee shop nearby that I go to.
[01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:47.080]   Wow, it's smart.
[01:39:47.080 --> 01:39:48.480]   Yeah, it's pretty good.
[01:39:48.480 --> 01:39:49.480]   It's smart.
[01:39:49.480 --> 01:39:50.800]   It's pretty good.
[01:39:50.800 --> 01:39:51.800]   So this is good.
[01:39:51.800 --> 01:39:54.960]   I have to go through these tips.
[01:39:54.960 --> 01:39:58.000]   But it does seem to be getting smarter as time goes by.
[01:39:58.000 --> 01:39:59.000]   It does.
[01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:00.000]   It does.
[01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:03.200]   But yeah, if you want this Lifehack article, it's just how to train Google Now to give
[01:40:03.200 --> 01:40:04.200]   you better suggestions.
[01:40:04.200 --> 01:40:05.200]   You can just Google that.
[01:40:05.200 --> 01:40:06.640]   Good stuff.
[01:40:06.640 --> 01:40:14.920]   My number of the week $3 billion that's reportedly would Facebook offered snap chats founders to
[01:40:14.920 --> 01:40:17.480]   buy snapchat and they turned down.
[01:40:17.480 --> 01:40:22.000]   Although there's a little code of that because apparently it said that Google perhaps has
[01:40:22.000 --> 01:40:29.800]   been in the bidding for this and might have even offered them $4 billion for snapchat.
[01:40:29.800 --> 01:40:34.120]   Something that teenagers could abandon in seconds if they chose.
[01:40:34.120 --> 01:40:37.960]   It reminded me of OMG Pop and their draw something.
[01:40:37.960 --> 01:40:45.320]   Remember they were acquired by Zinga at the peak of their perfection.
[01:40:45.320 --> 01:40:49.600]   And you know, I was thinking, wow, how much does Zinga because they of course, a year
[01:40:49.600 --> 01:40:54.840]   or two later, OMG Pop went out of business and was sold.
[01:40:54.840 --> 01:40:57.040]   Zinga gave them up.
[01:40:57.040 --> 01:40:59.000]   It's funny because it was only 200 million.
[01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:00.000]   That's all.
[01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:01.000]   That's all.
[01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:02.000]   Now billions.
[01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:04.680]   Now billions seems low for anything.
[01:41:04.680 --> 01:41:10.880]   It's going to take at least $3 billion to get snapchat.
[01:41:10.880 --> 01:41:11.880]   And apparently $0.10.
[01:41:11.880 --> 01:41:12.880]   What is that?
[01:41:12.880 --> 01:41:18.400]   That's the Chinese social network is also in the market.
[01:41:18.400 --> 01:41:20.480]   That's probably why the numbers got so high.
[01:41:20.480 --> 01:41:23.360]   But gosh, I just can't imagine it's really worth anything.
[01:41:23.360 --> 01:41:28.760]   Well, the thing is that it has, on some metrics, it has as many photos uploaded for
[01:41:28.760 --> 01:41:32.720]   a day as Facebook itself does.
[01:41:32.720 --> 01:41:35.880]   That's a marker of being the hock cultural thing at the moment.
[01:41:35.880 --> 01:41:38.720]   But that's the point is of the moment.
[01:41:38.720 --> 01:41:39.720]   Sure.
[01:41:39.720 --> 01:41:45.360]   But that's why Facebook would like to buy it and roll it in and buy it and shut it down.
[01:41:45.360 --> 01:41:50.320]   Either way, they'd be happy about that because they tried competing with it and they didn't
[01:41:50.320 --> 01:41:51.320]   work.
[01:41:51.320 --> 01:41:54.400]   They made poke when it was called.
[01:41:54.400 --> 01:42:00.640]   Mark Zuckerberg famously coded it himself using MWC precepts and agile.
[01:42:00.640 --> 01:42:03.240]   No, I don't know what he did.
[01:42:03.240 --> 01:42:04.320]   Agile MVC.
[01:42:04.320 --> 01:42:05.320]   Agile.
[01:42:05.320 --> 01:42:06.320]   Yeah.
[01:42:06.320 --> 01:42:07.320]   Uh huh.
[01:42:07.320 --> 01:42:13.080]   And so time for Kevin Marks thing and I am this first one.
[01:42:13.080 --> 01:42:15.040]   I'm really it's cool.
[01:42:15.040 --> 01:42:16.560]   Did you go to that event?
[01:42:16.560 --> 01:42:18.040]   It's tonight.
[01:42:18.040 --> 01:42:22.880]   So tonight in San Francisco, we're having the Homebrew website club.
[01:42:22.880 --> 01:42:26.640]   So last week was the, there was the 40th 35th anniversary.
[01:42:26.640 --> 01:42:27.640]   38th anniversary.
[01:42:27.640 --> 01:42:28.640]   38th anniversary.
[01:42:28.640 --> 01:42:31.920]   The Homebrew Computer Club, the Computer Eastern Museum.
[01:42:31.920 --> 01:42:36.720]   And my friend Tantec went to that and was inspired to say, okay, I see some parallels
[01:42:36.720 --> 01:42:39.360]   with what things are like now.
[01:42:39.360 --> 01:42:41.560]   Back then the problem was that you didn't have your own computer.
[01:42:41.560 --> 01:42:46.240]   They were all locked up in big companies and you had to timeshare to use them, everyone
[01:42:46.240 --> 01:42:48.080]   of their own computer.
[01:42:48.080 --> 01:42:50.480]   Whereas now it's kind of like that with the web.
[01:42:50.480 --> 01:42:54.080]   Only all our websites are locked up in big companies.
[01:42:54.080 --> 01:42:58.720]   And we used to have our, we used to be able to build things ourselves now that now everything
[01:42:58.720 --> 01:43:03.040]   you make is inside Facebook or whatever, or inside Google.
[01:43:03.040 --> 01:43:06.960]   So how about we use the, and this is the indie web stuff we've been talking about for a
[01:43:06.960 --> 01:43:10.160]   while, how about we use the same model that they did at the Homebrew Computer Club and
[01:43:10.160 --> 01:43:13.400]   have Homebrew website club.
[01:43:13.400 --> 01:43:22.040]   So it starts tonight, it's at Mozilla San Francisco, which is on the Embarcadero, like
[01:43:22.040 --> 01:43:24.320]   blocked down from the ferry building.
[01:43:24.320 --> 01:43:27.280]   And it's, and we plan to do this every couple of weeks.
[01:43:27.280 --> 01:43:28.640]   So I think this should be fun.
[01:43:28.640 --> 01:43:29.680]   Oh, I want to go.
[01:43:29.680 --> 01:43:30.680]   And what are we going to get?
[01:43:30.680 --> 01:43:31.680]   What's the prize?
[01:43:31.680 --> 01:43:37.440]   We're going to get our own webs, we're going to get our own web server running in a closet
[01:43:37.440 --> 01:43:41.040]   or we're going to talk about, you know, what, what this stuff is.
[01:43:41.040 --> 01:43:46.600]   But the indie web thing is, what does it mean to own your own website now?
[01:43:46.600 --> 01:43:50.280]   And how does that different from what it meant 10 years ago when we were all building blogs
[01:43:50.280 --> 01:43:51.280]   and things?
[01:43:51.280 --> 01:43:55.520]   And a big chunk of that is, well now in order for it to be useful, it has to plug into the
[01:43:55.520 --> 01:44:00.280]   ecosystem of Facebook and Twitter and Google+, and Snapchat.
[01:44:00.280 --> 01:44:01.720]   Well, you're not Snapchat, but.
[01:44:01.720 --> 01:44:03.880]   But the point is, you control it.
[01:44:03.880 --> 01:44:09.440]   But you still control it and you've got to make sure that the stuff you publish is somewhere
[01:44:09.440 --> 01:44:10.440]   that you have control of.
[01:44:10.440 --> 01:44:15.440]   And that's the debate is, you get like purest debates like, well, does it count if it's
[01:44:15.440 --> 01:44:17.880]   not your own domain, if it's just a subdomain of something else?
[01:44:17.880 --> 01:44:20.120]   And we're going to go in circles like that.
[01:44:20.120 --> 01:44:26.280]   But the spirit of it I think is really important because it's, it's a, in sense it's a marker
[01:44:26.280 --> 01:44:29.480]   of, you know, one of these tech pangels swinging back and forth.
[01:44:29.480 --> 01:44:36.880]   There was an explosion in, you know, 2000 to 2005 of everyone building their own websites.
[01:44:36.880 --> 01:44:42.480]   And then we had a, a consolidation wave for, you know, 10 years or so.
[01:44:42.480 --> 01:44:46.320]   And now it's, we think there's time for another one of these, like everyone can do their own
[01:44:46.320 --> 01:44:47.680]   thing waves again.
[01:44:47.680 --> 01:44:50.800]   So I'm, I'm looking forward to something over there tonight.
[01:44:50.800 --> 01:44:54.880]   And, you know, if, if you think it's interesting coming on.
[01:44:54.880 --> 01:44:59.520]   I think this is something that's been a current in my thinking since day one.
[01:44:59.520 --> 01:45:04.600]   In fact, I remember for a while using a blogging platform, I think it was Real Dornfest who
[01:45:04.600 --> 01:45:05.600]   wrote it.
[01:45:05.600 --> 01:45:10.320]   And you would just blog to your hard drive.
[01:45:10.320 --> 01:45:12.480]   You would create files and structures in your hard drive.
[01:45:12.480 --> 01:45:16.040]   And then he had a little demon that would upload it to a website, but really lived on
[01:45:16.040 --> 01:45:17.040]   your hard drive.
[01:45:17.040 --> 01:45:18.040]   Right.
[01:45:18.040 --> 01:45:22.120]   And just, I, it, I've always thought about this kind of thing.
[01:45:22.120 --> 01:45:27.880]   That's why I was really interested in what was that Twitter clone that we all used for
[01:45:27.880 --> 01:45:28.880]   a day.
[01:45:28.880 --> 01:45:32.280]   I'm not appnet, but the, but the one that Evan, prodromo,
[01:45:32.280 --> 01:45:36.800]   identical, identical status net status net status net.
[01:45:36.800 --> 01:45:39.880]   And he's now got a new one called pump IO that he's, he's written another one from scratch
[01:45:39.880 --> 01:45:41.960]   because he's kind of like that.
[01:45:41.960 --> 01:45:42.960]   Yeah.
[01:45:42.960 --> 01:45:43.960]   No, that's all part of it.
[01:45:43.960 --> 01:45:46.680]   And then the indie web indie web thing is about that.
[01:45:46.680 --> 01:45:48.720]   So it's saying, what does it mean to do this?
[01:45:48.720 --> 01:45:51.960]   And it is, it is, you know, it's the happiest thing at the moment.
[01:45:51.960 --> 01:45:57.320]   You're running your own code and indie webcam is a sort of series of us saying, yeah, this
[01:45:57.320 --> 01:46:01.520]   is a series of us kind of still sucks, but look, I can plug it into this side.
[01:46:01.520 --> 01:46:06.200]   But the hope is that we get to the point where we can, we can actually come up with
[01:46:06.200 --> 01:46:09.840]   interrupt principles and plug these things in and make it more straightforward for people
[01:46:09.840 --> 01:46:15.400]   to be able to build these things themselves without handing over everything and, you know,
[01:46:15.400 --> 01:46:19.640]   handing over control effectively to what becomes the large corporation.
[01:46:19.640 --> 01:46:20.640]   Oh, damn.
[01:46:20.640 --> 01:46:22.360]   You have to install image magic.
[01:46:22.360 --> 01:46:24.560]   Why is everything require image magic?
[01:46:24.560 --> 01:46:27.560]   I ask you.
[01:46:27.560 --> 01:46:31.040]   I think we think of I'm going along just fine.
[01:46:31.040 --> 01:46:32.040]   I got a server.
[01:46:32.040 --> 01:46:33.040]   I got a bag.
[01:46:33.040 --> 01:46:34.040]   I got the image.
[01:46:34.040 --> 01:46:35.040]   Yeah.
[01:46:35.040 --> 01:46:37.040]   What was it?
[01:46:37.040 --> 01:46:38.040]   EDO.
[01:46:38.040 --> 01:46:39.040]   Yeah.
[01:46:39.040 --> 01:46:42.360]   So what is pump IO?
[01:46:42.360 --> 01:46:43.880]   This is actually intriguing now.
[01:46:43.880 --> 01:46:46.080]   I see I get sucked in by all of these things.
[01:46:46.080 --> 01:46:50.000]   So pump IO is another iteration of the same idea as identical except that this time he's
[01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:57.920]   put it on node rather than on PHP and his good and it has a, you know, it has the same
[01:46:57.920 --> 01:47:00.040]   activity streams model and can plug into that.
[01:47:00.040 --> 01:47:04.480]   So you have to install node JS NPM, a database server in the graphics magic package.
[01:47:04.480 --> 01:47:07.560]   There's still a bunch of, yeah, I thought, oh, maybe I can run this on Roku and like
[01:47:07.560 --> 01:47:10.360]   three hours and I was like, oh, man.
[01:47:10.360 --> 01:47:11.360]   Yeah.
[01:47:11.360 --> 01:47:19.960]   So this is why we use other people's phones.
[01:47:19.960 --> 01:47:22.760]   Hosted solutions and managed solutions.
[01:47:22.760 --> 01:47:23.760]   Exactly.
[01:47:23.760 --> 01:47:28.880]   So as I say, this is still like, you know, we're still working on this stuff smooth enough
[01:47:28.880 --> 01:47:30.680]   for humans as opposed to programmers.
[01:47:30.680 --> 01:47:31.680]   Yeah.
[01:47:31.680 --> 01:47:32.680]   But it's fun.
[01:47:32.680 --> 01:47:33.680]   Hey, good news.
[01:47:33.680 --> 01:47:34.680]   It works with couch base.
[01:47:34.680 --> 01:47:35.680]   All right.
[01:47:35.680 --> 01:47:36.680]   That's enough of that.
[01:47:36.680 --> 01:47:37.680]   So.
[01:47:37.680 --> 01:47:41.960]   Ah, what fun it is.
[01:47:41.960 --> 01:47:42.960]   Kevin Marks.
[01:47:42.960 --> 01:47:44.200]   Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:47:44.200 --> 01:47:45.200]   How's it?
[01:47:45.200 --> 01:47:46.200]   Are you on a job hunt?
[01:47:46.200 --> 01:47:48.040]   Are you just enjoying life?
[01:47:48.040 --> 01:47:52.920]   I'm fascinated by this set of stuff and I'm working out what the job I can make out of
[01:47:52.920 --> 01:47:53.920]   this is.
[01:47:53.920 --> 01:47:55.440]   Empower the user.
[01:47:55.440 --> 01:48:00.400]   This indie web thing, I think, you know, I think the time is right for this stuff and
[01:48:00.400 --> 01:48:03.480]   I don't know what the job is yet, but we'd all involve this in some way.
[01:48:03.480 --> 01:48:04.480]   I agree.
[01:48:04.480 --> 01:48:05.480]   It's what is the zines?
[01:48:05.480 --> 01:48:06.960]   What is the zine for 2013?
[01:48:06.960 --> 01:48:13.240]   No, it's like, you know, like 10 years ago, I left Apple and went to Tech Lorati because
[01:48:13.240 --> 01:48:17.600]   that was the thing that was the startup there that made sense around that movement.
[01:48:17.600 --> 01:48:21.640]   And it's that it's that if for me, this is this feels like that again.
[01:48:21.640 --> 01:48:25.080]   It's like, okay, I've got sales force.
[01:48:25.080 --> 01:48:26.760]   I think this stuff is really important.
[01:48:26.760 --> 01:48:30.840]   I'm not sure what what I get to make here yet, but I'm going to be doing something with
[01:48:30.840 --> 01:48:31.840]   this.
[01:48:31.840 --> 01:48:32.840]   Good.
[01:48:32.840 --> 01:48:33.840]   Cool.
[01:48:33.840 --> 01:48:39.520]   I find this stuff very exciting and it's really inspiring because you know, you have done
[01:48:39.520 --> 01:48:41.280]   this and yeah, absolutely.
[01:48:41.280 --> 01:48:42.280]   Absolutely.
[01:48:42.280 --> 01:48:43.280]   Absolutely.
[01:48:43.280 --> 01:48:47.560]   MrPanny Smarterware.org is our blog site, but you got to go to ThinkUp.com.
[01:48:47.560 --> 01:48:49.520]   Not too late to participate, is it?
[01:48:49.520 --> 01:48:50.520]   No, it isn't.
[01:48:50.520 --> 01:48:52.360]   Well, we wrapped up the crowdfunding campaign.
[01:48:52.360 --> 01:48:53.680]   You did wrap it up.
[01:48:53.680 --> 01:48:56.160]   Yeah, yeah, we wrapped it up and we did really well.
[01:48:56.160 --> 01:49:00.000]   Thank you to everybody who listens to Twig, who supported us.
[01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:01.160]   And you can still join.
[01:49:01.160 --> 01:49:03.680]   We don't have some of the we don't have some of the rewards that we had during the crowdfunding
[01:49:03.680 --> 01:49:07.280]   campaign, but we're yeah, we're kind of just going into a quiet period heads down, just
[01:49:07.280 --> 01:49:10.880]   building the system that all helped us launch on January 15th.
[01:49:10.880 --> 01:49:12.800]   So I'm pretty excited about that.
[01:49:12.800 --> 01:49:13.800]   It's really coming along.
[01:49:13.800 --> 01:49:16.160]   And what do you call your custom framework?
[01:49:16.160 --> 01:49:17.600]   You call it ETA?
[01:49:17.600 --> 01:49:22.080]   My, my MVC framework is called isosceles, actually.
[01:49:22.080 --> 01:49:23.080]   I like it.
[01:49:23.080 --> 01:49:24.080]   Really, really geeky name.
[01:49:24.080 --> 01:49:26.080]   Because it's an equilateral triangle.
[01:49:26.080 --> 01:49:27.080]   Yeah.
[01:49:27.080 --> 01:49:31.160]   Actually, it's inspired by the, yeah, that the, the Freedom Tower has those isosceles,
[01:49:31.160 --> 01:49:32.280]   triangles on the side.
[01:49:32.280 --> 01:49:33.440]   So I, so I called it that.
[01:49:33.440 --> 01:49:34.520]   It's, that's all my GitHub account.
[01:49:34.520 --> 01:49:35.520]   It's free and open source.
[01:49:35.520 --> 01:49:36.520]   It's PHP, of course.
[01:49:36.520 --> 01:49:38.080]   It's very, very simple.
[01:49:38.080 --> 01:49:40.800]   But ThinkUp is built on it and all of our internal systems are built on it.
[01:49:40.800 --> 01:49:43.280]   So anyone's free to, free to use it.
[01:49:43.280 --> 01:49:46.600]   And yeah, that's, that's basically it.
[01:49:46.600 --> 01:49:50.440]   You know, you're a real programmer when the first six months are spent writing your own
[01:49:50.440 --> 01:49:51.440]   tools.
[01:49:51.440 --> 01:49:57.920]   I, I, I built ThinkUp and I want to use MVC and I built it inside ThinkUp, but I abstracted
[01:49:57.920 --> 01:50:01.200]   out the framework because I wanted to build a couple of other web apps and I was like,
[01:50:01.200 --> 01:50:02.440]   I want this to be just like ThinkUp.
[01:50:02.440 --> 01:50:05.160]   So I abstracted out the framework from the ThinkUp.
[01:50:05.160 --> 01:50:10.560]   Yeah, which, which I always like to sort of do that way, you know, like build the software
[01:50:10.560 --> 01:50:14.400]   that actually, you know, an actual bit of software that runs versus designing the framework
[01:50:14.400 --> 01:50:18.840]   and assuming or thinking or, you know, thinking of the things I might want.
[01:50:18.840 --> 01:50:19.840]   So that, that was good.
[01:50:19.840 --> 01:50:20.840]   I was able to abstract out.
[01:50:20.840 --> 01:50:25.680]   That's a, that's a good way to, to, to refactor and say, okay, this stuff I now need to use
[01:50:25.680 --> 01:50:27.480]   more than once this stuff was, was specific.
[01:50:27.480 --> 01:50:28.480]   Yeah, that's exactly.
[01:50:28.480 --> 01:50:29.480]   Exactly.
[01:50:29.480 --> 01:50:30.480]   Yeah.
[01:50:30.480 --> 01:50:33.000]   Yeah, because you know how programmers, YAGNI ain't gonna need it.
[01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.560]   You always think you're gonna need stuff that you don't need.
[01:50:35.560 --> 01:50:36.560]   Agni.
[01:50:36.560 --> 01:50:37.560]   YAGNI at all.
[01:50:37.560 --> 01:50:42.040]   Well, no, but we also get run into these abstraction things like what if I have two of those, it's
[01:50:42.040 --> 01:50:44.040]   like, maybe you won't ever have to.
[01:50:44.040 --> 01:50:47.360]   But if you have three, when this, what is the cutoff?
[01:50:47.360 --> 01:50:48.360]   All right.
[01:50:48.360 --> 01:50:50.680]   Did you see, we were talking about this on security now.
[01:50:50.680 --> 01:50:57.540]   Apparently there's a flaw in the GCC optimizer that it optimizes out things like checks for
[01:50:57.540 --> 01:51:02.200]   null pointers because well, that you don't need that.
[01:51:02.200 --> 01:51:04.520]   It's just wasting time.
[01:51:04.520 --> 01:51:05.520]   Wasting time.
[01:51:05.520 --> 01:51:06.520]   Ouch.
[01:51:06.520 --> 01:51:07.520]   It's right.
[01:51:07.520 --> 01:51:08.520]   All right.
[01:51:08.520 --> 01:51:11.200]   Enough programmer talk.
[01:51:11.200 --> 01:51:12.200]   Thank you, Gina.
[01:51:12.200 --> 01:51:13.200]   Thank you, Kevin.
[01:51:13.200 --> 01:51:14.560]   Thank you for being here.
[01:51:14.560 --> 01:51:18.040]   The show is when Jeff's not here, we do get a little geeky.
[01:51:18.040 --> 01:51:26.400]   The show is every Wednesday at 1 p.m. Pacific, 4 p.m. Eastern time, 2100 UTC on Twit.tv.
[01:51:26.400 --> 01:51:27.400]   Please stop by and watch live.
[01:51:27.400 --> 01:51:31.960]   But if you can't on demand, audio and video is always available after the fact that Twit.tv
[01:51:31.960 --> 01:51:37.840]   slash twig or wherever finer podcasts are aggregated.
[01:51:37.840 --> 01:51:44.720]   But if you were really smart, you'd write your own podcast client to download it whenever
[01:51:44.720 --> 01:51:45.720]   necessary.
[01:51:45.720 --> 01:51:48.320]   Hey, if Adam Curry could do it, you can do it.
[01:51:48.320 --> 01:51:49.320]   Marco's doing it.
[01:51:49.320 --> 01:51:50.320]   So there you go.
[01:51:50.320 --> 01:51:52.280]   No, Marco's writing a new pod catcher.
[01:51:52.280 --> 01:51:53.280]   Yes.
[01:51:53.280 --> 01:51:54.280]   That's his new thing.
[01:51:54.280 --> 01:51:55.280]   Yeah.
[01:51:55.280 --> 01:51:56.280]   Face palm.
[01:51:56.280 --> 01:51:57.280]   Literally.
[01:51:57.280 --> 01:51:58.280]   I did.
[01:51:58.280 --> 01:52:01.320]   I did run my own 110 years ago.
[01:52:01.320 --> 01:52:02.320]   Yeah.
[01:52:02.320 --> 01:52:06.840]   Now there's now I'm the one I'm looking at is what's it called?
[01:52:06.840 --> 01:52:08.400]   And tenopod because that's open source.
[01:52:08.400 --> 01:52:10.400]   So I may I may be.
[01:52:10.400 --> 01:52:11.400]   Good.
[01:52:11.400 --> 01:52:12.400]   Good.
[01:52:12.400 --> 01:52:13.400]   Good.
[01:52:13.400 --> 01:52:14.400]   Good.
[01:52:14.400 --> 01:52:15.400]   That's the one I use for listening podcast Android now.
[01:52:15.400 --> 01:52:18.640]   So did you write yours in Python?
[01:52:18.640 --> 01:52:19.640]   Probably.
[01:52:19.640 --> 01:52:20.640]   Yes.
[01:52:20.640 --> 01:52:21.640]   Yes.
[01:52:21.640 --> 01:52:22.640]   Yes.
[01:52:22.640 --> 01:52:23.640]   Yeah.
[01:52:23.640 --> 01:52:27.080]   No, I wrote a little bit of very simple Python script that pulled feeds and then it called
[01:52:27.080 --> 01:52:33.480]   iTunes with Apple script to post the post the things into a into a and iTunes thing.
[01:52:33.480 --> 01:52:35.480]   And then you plug the I put it in it with sync it.
[01:52:35.480 --> 01:52:38.520]   That was the thing I wrote 10 years ago.
[01:52:38.520 --> 01:52:42.440]   So Marcos will be called overcast overcast overcast.
[01:52:42.440 --> 01:52:43.440]   Yes.
[01:52:43.440 --> 01:52:47.120]   Very topical because we haven't had enough rain.
[01:52:47.120 --> 01:52:49.080]   Thank you everybody for joining us.
[01:52:49.080 --> 01:52:50.440]   Use overcast if you wish.
[01:52:50.440 --> 01:52:51.800]   I don't care.
[01:52:51.800 --> 01:52:52.800]   I'm content.
[01:52:52.800 --> 01:52:54.800]   I don't have to worry about the wiring.
[01:52:54.800 --> 01:52:55.800]   Huh?
[01:52:55.800 --> 01:52:56.800]   It's iOS only.
[01:52:56.800 --> 01:52:57.960]   He's not doing Android versions.
[01:52:57.960 --> 01:52:58.960]   He's not.
[01:52:58.960 --> 01:52:59.960]   It's just iOS.
[01:52:59.960 --> 01:53:00.960]   Yeah.
[01:53:00.960 --> 01:53:01.960]   That's Marco.
[01:53:01.960 --> 01:53:02.960]   Yeah, I'm sure that it's just iOS.
[01:53:02.960 --> 01:53:03.960]   Yeah.
[01:53:03.960 --> 01:53:06.920]   He says, I like some iOS podcast apps, but I don't love any of them.
[01:53:06.920 --> 01:53:08.720]   So I'm making my own.
[01:53:08.720 --> 01:53:09.720]   Yep.
[01:53:09.720 --> 01:53:10.720]   That's yep.
[01:53:10.720 --> 01:53:11.720]   That's programming.
[01:53:11.720 --> 01:53:14.880]   He also wrote his own NBC framework.
[01:53:14.880 --> 01:53:16.640]   Of course he did.
[01:53:16.640 --> 01:53:18.280]   Of course he did.
[01:53:18.280 --> 01:53:24.040]   And I decided and he's spending the last six months on tools so I can write a podcast
[01:53:24.040 --> 01:53:25.040]   app.
[01:53:25.040 --> 01:53:26.040]   Thank you everybody for joining us.
[01:53:26.040 --> 01:53:28.040]   We'll see you next time on Twig.
[01:53:28.040 --> 01:53:28.720]   Bye bye.
[01:53:28.720 --> 01:53:38.720]   (music)
