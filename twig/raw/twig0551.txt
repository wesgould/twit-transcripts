[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400]   It's time for Twig this week in Google. Stacey Higginbotham's here. Jeff Jarvis.
[00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:09.080]   We're sheltering in place with the latest Google News. Jeff's list of who to follow
[00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:14.840]   on Twitter for expert Corona and virus advice. Elon Musk says, "Hell no, I'm not
[00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:20.800]   closing the factory and it's a million dollar award to two computing pioneers."
[00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.280]   It's all coming up next on Twig. This week in Google comes to you from Twitt's

[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:31.380]   cover the Googleverse, Facebook, Twitter and all of that jazz. I am here. Stacey
[00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.820]   Higginbotham is here from her island lair. You're lucky. You're in an island
[00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:41.500]   isolated from the world. There's four cases on the island I think.
[00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.780]   Now it's bad. Now you want to get off the island.
[00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:50.940]   Now I'm stuck on this island. Staysianiot.com/atgigastacey. Of course, a great
[00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:56.460]   IoT podcast with Kevin Tofel. Mr. Jeff Jarvis is also here. He's in
[00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.020]   Wisconsin, New Jersey. They're pretty serious in New Jersey, aren't they?
[00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.140]   Very serious in New Jersey. We don't screw around here.
[00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.220]   This is the first town to have a curfew I think was Hoboken. Aren't they?
[00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.140]   They're telling you have to go to bed. Yeah. Well, it's also because Hoboken is
[00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:16.340]   filled with obnoxious drunks. A curfew on St. Patrick's Day makes a lot of sense.
[00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.220]   Oh, it does get the amateurs off the street. Yeah.
[00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.300]   Newark Strong, he's wearing... Is that what that says? No. No, no, no.
[00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.740]   No marks strong there's a big difference. Oh, okay Mark Jay school. Yes from
[00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:37.460]   CUNY kuny. That's a nice looking uh it is a good honey. Yes. I kind of I kind of want it
[00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:44.000]   I went to the Cronkite school. I didn't get a sweatshirt. Yeah, uncle Walter. Where's my sweatshirt
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.400]   We do this show Wednesdays
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.380]   You may notice there's a slight difference to the way if you're watching the video the where we're shooting it
[00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:57.320]   If you listen you won't notice the difference, but normally we do it at the round table at our in our big studio
[00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.960]   And I am not in the round table
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:05.780]   I'm in my office because of course we're sheltering in place here. We're one of the now eight Bay Area counties
[00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.120]   with the shelter in place order and
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:14.300]   I was gonna do it from the house, but then I realized I actually could come in here. No, I lock the door of my
[00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.180]   My office and nobody can come and go
[00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.320]   Even engineers can't come in they don't come in to empty the trash or anything
[00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.440]   I do all that and that way I feel like this is as safe as my office
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.220]   Except for that brief moment when I'm passing through the hall on the way to the men's room, but I have
[00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.300]   appropriate
[00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.300]   Cowbells or breaking
[00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:43.260]   So I think you know and we have a skeleton crew here. There's one engineer running the board in fact the transition
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.880]   Took a little longer to get into the show because they wiped the entire board down with
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.840]   with
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:52.160]   sanitizing wipes
[00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.840]   So that Kevin who's running the board now can take over from John John's gonna go home
[00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:02.840]   So we're trying to make it. There's only one engineer here at any one time. There are a couple of skeleton crew staff here
[00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.680]   But I think you know
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.440]   All our hosts are gonna operate from home
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.480]   I think we're gonna be able to do this just fine and we take this pretty seriously
[00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.300]   Because I think podcasts are gonna be one of those places you can go
[00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:21.280]   That's short of like the the news that's making everybody crazy
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.960]   It's your friends and we're talking about stuff you're interested in we'll talk a little bit about you know
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.920]   The virus is impressing your song huh podcast or the place
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:38.000]   I
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.480]   No resembles to the two
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.400]   No, I thought it was quite good. I thought that was quite good
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.440]   We're like cheers
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:54.240]   Yes, and we're just all cliff clavin and nobody here a world. Yeah
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:05:01.520]   I don't know maybe I am Woody Harrelson. I want to be Sam. Can I be Sam? No, you're not not Sam
[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:07.000]   I am not my Diane. I was hoping but okay. That's fine never mind. I'll see grammar
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.240]   Yeah, I think I am actually
[00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.720]   Frasier, Frasier
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:21.320]   So I actually I'm coach actually the chatroom says I'm coach. I will take that I will take that yes
[00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:25.320]   Yeah, that's good. That's good the Captain Kang roof tech some have called me
[00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:31.400]   So we have no Carsten cam this has me this has me just saff Carson put in a requisition
[00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.720]   For a carsten cam
[00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.920]   I vetoed it. That's where it would have been
[00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:45.760]   No, it wouldn't have been he wanted that carsten cam as house that we then put an avatar a little tiny TV screen there
[00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:52.680]   For the but you know, we're let's let's not go. Let's not go crazy. I'm pretty funny. Let's not go crazy. He made
[00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:58.520]   Masks plague doctor beaked
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.720]   COVID masks for like those scary yeah
[00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:08.400]   Yeah, he made him out of leather and piping the glue, you know blinked in the dark and stuff
[00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:12.240]   And he actually fed ex them to the two hosts
[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:16.240]   We had Marques Brownly and Amy Webb on a twit this week
[00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:22.280]   But they wisely declined to wear them. I wore mine because I took a hit for our guy
[00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:24.800]   but
[00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.240]   Would have been a funny shot the three of us in our COVID masks
[00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:30.880]   Never mind glad it didn't happen
[00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.720]   Let's see. Can I start off with something here? Yeah, I'm gonna let you pick
[00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:40.200]   I don't want to I think we need to talk a little bit about this, but I want to do a COVID show by
[00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:47.520]   Well, there's tons of no I know I just want to I rarely plug anything but I did a Twitter list of
[00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:55.520]   Experts and it took me not much time last weekend to go through and I've been adding to it and totally I need that as I go
[00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:59.760]   So it's on the rundown. I've got three so it's if you go to Twitter look at my list
[00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:01.760]   It's the COVID list. I have now
[00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:04.320]   25 or thereabouts
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:08.760]   epidemiologists researchers doctors a little bit NGO
[00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:16.080]   Few journalists few policy people, but it really is the experts really the people and I
[00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:18.920]   Glued to it now
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:21.440]   Last I checked it had 1.4 or
[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:28.680]   I forget how many followers it had it it last night it had less than a thousand now it has 2.6 thousand
[00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:31.520]   So if you go to Twitter actually I'll show you
[00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:35.640]   I'll do it on my system so I can show people what to do because
[00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:39.640]   What's nice is Twitter is kind of brought back lists. Yes
[00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:44.840]   Which I think was one of the best features of Twitter and for a while they were kind of deprecating it
[00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:49.600]   So if you go to Jeff's Twitter feed and I watch I'm sorry
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:58.280]   Even use the dim mode I go all the way tonight. Oh, that looks like fine. I think it looks good doesn't it?
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:05.400]   Yeah, yeah dark Twitter man if you click the three dots next to Jeff's head and go to view lists
[00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:11.160]   You'll see his list that's a little confusing because there is a list item roll this there's a list item
[00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:13.080]   But that's your lists on the left there
[00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:19.160]   so don't do the one on the left go to the three dots next to Jeff's head and then it shows his list and then if you click on his
[00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:24.440]   list you can subscribe to it and I think it's worth subscribing to because
[00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:32.000]   Then once you've subscribed to it if you go to your lists and you see I have a lot of lists that I follow and I've made and so
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.880]   For tonight, oops what happened there? I don't know what happened Twitter. I don't understand
[00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:41.200]   How do I follow your list or how do I go to it says subscribe?
[00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:47.800]   Now now from your list it should be in my list right? Oh, I sorry. I didn't click the subscribe tab
[00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:48.720]   There it is
[00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:53.660]   So the easiest way to do this is that and then you can you know your Twitter
[00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:56.200]   Top stop there for one second Debbie Shridhar
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:58.720]   She is
[00:08:58.720 --> 00:09:00.800]   incredible. She's in the in Scotland and
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:06.540]   She's there. I think she's as important as Anthony Fauci
[00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:12.620]   And and really smart and I've learned a lot from her. There are scientists in here who?
[00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:15.480]   reveal
[00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:19.140]   Latest of their of their of their tests and it's very early stuff and love that I don't understand
[00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:21.560]   I didn't understand something today about these
[00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:28.900]   Assays seratology tests there was some progress so I went in I asked somebody can you explain this to me and they explained it to me really clearly
[00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:35.380]   They're busy. I don't want to bug them, but it's quite phenomenal to see science in action
[00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:37.940]   Yeah, what this is very nice. Thank you for making that list
[00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:41.620]   So I just wanted to want to mention that and I think if you're if you're tired of
[00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:46.500]   Talk about misinformation the beauty of this is you go to where the experts are
[00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:49.980]   I'm not I'm not bothered in the least by any disinformation
[00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:52.520]   I just spend my day on that getting scared to death
[00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:57.980]   I have advised people it probably isn't good to live on Twitter
[00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:04.480]   If you don't want your anxiety level to ramp up any more than it's good to watch the news stations
[00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:06.300]   Well, you watch Fox. That's very relaxing
[00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:11.960]   But if you watch the other news stations, it might also ramp up just a little bit actually foxes gotten scary too
[00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:18.440]   You know I zane up to ficki wrote an article in the times I thought was very interesting
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:21.200]   She is a professor of information science
[00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:26.140]   Great sociologist and has been doing some great stuff on her scientific American blog
[00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:32.720]   But she said something about masks. Did you read that opinion piece that she wrote that I was interesting?
[00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:38.860]   She said you know the government would have been better off if they hadn't lied to us
[00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:45.040]   About masks the drumbeat has been very strong masks. Don't do anything only if you're sick
[00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:48.520]   Should you wear a mask? She said masks help
[00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:54.000]   People wear masks are less likely to get infected what the government should have said is
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.440]   There's a mask shortage
[00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:58.040]   Please don't
[00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:02.720]   Buy masks let the medical professionals who really need them have them
[00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:08.540]   But if there were an infinite supply of masks the right advice would be everybody should wear a mask when they're
[00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:12.440]   anywhere near people because they do help they may not be perfect
[00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:18.400]   But they do help and she made an excellent point. She said you could even make your own surgical mask
[00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:20.280]   It's not an N95 mask
[00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:26.680]   But even that will help for two reasons one because it does keep particles from spraying into your mouth and nose
[00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:30.760]   But two it also reduces amount of time you touch your face and of course
[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:36.520]   That's one of the big problems is particles that land on surfaces that then you touch and then you touch your eyes nose or mouth
[00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:43.640]   Her her hand from her chin. Yeah, well, I sanitized if I'm gonna like in here
[00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:48.320]   I feel like I could touch my face because I'm clean I've washed my hands. I've sanitized
[00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:52.920]   I'm clean, but when you go out in public you got to stop we took a nice walk the other day and
[00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:55.820]   We did we did a no-no and I didn't realize till we got back
[00:11:55.820 --> 00:12:03.720]   We went over to the middle school where Michael who's now 17 went to junior high and he couldn't resist playing on the playground equipment
[00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:10.680]   And I read that's a no-no take a walk, but don't touch any metal touch any or plastic surfaces wasn't copper
[00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:14.340]   Yeah, so these masks that did not buy I had we bought these
[00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:17.000]   Months ago after the fires
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.760]   These N95 masks, so I I probably should bring them over to the hospital
[00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:28.760]   There's now requests if you're a construction company or if you're a nail salon or if you're a veterinary office or a dentist office
[00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:34.320]   Do not wear well get whatever you have get them to the hospital
[00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:36.200]   Yeah, so yeah
[00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:40.840]   Yeah, cuz they that's really the issue and I think to Vicki was right is but you know
[00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:48.360]   I this happens all the time public health officials don't trust the public with the truth, so they often shade it a little bit
[00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:55.560]   Gary tobs read a great article in a time some years ago saying you know salt really isn't a problem
[00:12:56.160 --> 00:13:01.640]   But because in some cases salt raises people's blood pressure public health officials decided well
[00:13:01.640 --> 00:13:03.640]   We're just gonna make that a blanket recommendation
[00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:08.280]   Not all people I I a lot of salt my blood pressure is not affected by it
[00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:13.320]   So not all people are so this is this is not unusual in public health where they make these blanket claims
[00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:18.400]   The problem is to picky points out is when you do that and you're caught out then it
[00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:25.680]   Roads trust and trust is so important at this time. Yeah, you you should not lie to your people
[00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:30.200]   I mean if you know something catastrophic maybe maybe you don't tell the whole truth
[00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:35.180]   But you shouldn't actively lie that is yeah, no where is that good public policy? No ever?
[00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:41.760]   So yeah, it bothers me a little bit. There is there is a silver lining I guess to all of this
[00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:47.200]   HP's hostile or Xerox's hostile takeover of HP is now off
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:51.080]   Because nobody's at the office to work on it
[00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:59.960]   There is also a negative Google's announced that don't expect updates to Chrome or Chrome OS in a timely fashion
[00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:02.600]   everybody's home
[00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:08.680]   We can't they still work on it. Yeah, I work from home like I've put out entire publications
[00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:14.080]   Remotely Google says you to adjusted work schedules at this time. We are pausing
[00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:16.840]   upcoming Chrome and Chrome OS releases
[00:14:16.840 --> 00:14:22.480]   This makes sense actually because if you do have the thing is a lot of people are home with their kids
[00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:26.800]   And you are gonna be less there's another issue and this has come up with Apple
[00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:29.960]   As you know Apple's very security focused
[00:14:29.960 --> 00:14:32.600]   a lot of the employees who
[00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:37.440]   You would think could work at home can't because a lot of Apple security requires you to be on-prem
[00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:44.400]   Google has adopted and maybe is less prone to this. I don't know a more modern approach
[00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:47.920]   So there's it's actually Ben Thompson had a great article in this on a stratecary
[00:14:48.720 --> 00:14:52.080]   The way Google Google does it is called zero trust
[00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:56.880]   Traditionally businesses assume well if you're on premises, you're you're trusted
[00:14:56.880 --> 00:15:01.640]   If you have a VPN and you're logging into the internet you're trusted
[00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:08.680]   Google's zero trust assumes all sort resources all devices at any time
[00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:17.440]   Could be accessed by anybody. It's like everything is public even before this. Yeah, and by doing this then you set up
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.400]   Procedures and policies that are secure no matter what and that is a better way of doing it
[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:27.320]   Then kind of making some assumptions about all this guys on premises. It must be okay
[00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:35.640]   Yeah, that's that's a super secure way to think about things a lot of it. It's a big sick. It's a best practice in security. Yeah, and apparently
[00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:44.640]   Google has implemented that but nevertheless having trouble my guess Apple hadn't because a lot of Apple employees are
[00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:51.400]   Either have to stay at the campus or or can't do their job and I'm wondering maybe Google's having a little bit of that
[00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:57.440]   Problem is creepy if you have like firefox isn't that done remotely? Yeah, that's the other side of it
[00:15:57.440 --> 00:16:06.080]   You and I and everybody on podcasting and a lot of geeks work at home. Anyway, this is our normal environment. We're happy
[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:13.280]   Yeah, but I mean I'll even tell you I mean I'm not used to having my kid who is 13 and actually has a school that is
[00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:16.760]   completely prepared I mean imagine I
[00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:24.840]   Mean you can't expect someone with like a four-year-old in a six-year-old. Yeah to work from home and be yep
[00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:27.960]   No, that's true. I mean you're suddenly doing child care
[00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:32.920]   And it's hard to get a job done. I've worked at home with kids young kids
[00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:38.280]   It's a lot harder to get a job done my kids used to pat on the door if they knew I was in my office
[00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:40.640]   We just go bam, am I?
[00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:43.120]   And I know you're in there. I'm working. There was a
[00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:49.480]   Remember who it was but a freelancer on Twitter who is there a journalist
[00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:53.400]   She was talking about how like telling other people who are freelancers
[00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:58.160]   She's the kids will be okay. You should shut yourself in get your job done. She's like I have
[00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:04.960]   Like been on a phone call with someone walking in a park taking notes while tossing fruit snacks at my kids
[00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:06.960]   So they would just not crying
[00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:12.200]   Disparating a message ever but you know what she's like my her kids were fine
[00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:14.200]   And you know what I've done something
[00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:18.600]   Remarkably similar with my child when necessary and she's also fun all the time
[00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:25.440]   Well, yeah, I was an absent father somewhat because I remember my kids saying put the blackberry down
[00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:28.960]   Because I even with even pre smartphone
[00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:33.760]   I'm looking at typing on my little keyboard on my blackberry
[00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:40.000]   They didn't like it and I think it's maybe you know, there's a balance obviously it is amazing watching
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:45.160]   These families deal with it. We went my wife and I was so grateful that are grown because it's tough
[00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:50.000]   Yeah, it's hard and you're trying to do your job and you're both trying to do your job and who does what and
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   I talked I saw I saw one thing come across in my feed today in the list
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.320]   Somebody said
[00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:04.400]   One of the one of the parents got sick and said what if the other parent gets instead don't stay away from your kids
[00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:11.480]   And said well, what if my other kid my other my partner gets sick. Well, you haven't thought we haven't had that happen yet
[00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:14.160]   We're a cluster
[00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:17.520]   Lisa and I and Michael and if any one of us gets sick
[00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:23.240]   Well, there you go. We're all gonna get sick, but we will we then close the door and it's kind of hard
[00:18:24.560 --> 00:18:29.680]   Michael's dad. I'm a stepdad Michael's dad used to come over several times a week and have dinner with us
[00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:31.800]   He can anymore. It's hard for Michael
[00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:36.560]   And we don't want Michael to go over there because he could go over there get something and come home and bring it home
[00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:41.500]   His friends you every Friday. We had 16 age boys in the house
[00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:44.480]   Thank God, we don't have to do that
[00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:52.040]   It's not just food there's a lot of sweat and socks
[00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:55.080]   Stuff I don't I don't need that
[00:18:55.080 --> 00:19:06.000]   We've gone through a bunch of sliding screen doors, I'll just you can imagine the other day
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:11.800]   They were over and they found a metal detector and they found all the metal in the yard and they've put it on our porch
[00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:17.920]   I don't you know a lot of rusty metal on the porch don't know if any of its valuable, but it was fun. It was fun
[00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:20.200]   They had a good time. There's holes in the yard
[00:19:22.080 --> 00:19:27.560]   Anyway, I don't mind that they're not coming over, but Michael's going a little stir crazy about a little cabin fever
[00:19:27.560 --> 00:19:33.200]   Oh, the other hand. I'm also counting. I'm a ten days from my last ride in a New York City subway. Not so bad
[00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:37.720]   Right, you know, you get to 14 you're gonna be okay, right? Well for that part
[00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:41.560]   I mean we had to go to the store but there's but but my my contact is just
[00:19:41.560 --> 00:19:44.320]   imploded
[00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:49.640]   From what it was being in New Yorker. Oh gosh. Yes in fact, I think one of the upshuts of this
[00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:52.600]   Well, you know when this ends
[00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:55.800]   Someday we'll emerge out into the world bleary-eyed
[00:19:55.800 --> 00:19:59.360]   See if it's still out there and it'll be a very different world
[00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:04.960]   I'm not gonna be able to go to trade shows anymore and not be thinking I can't
[00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:11.320]   There's five germs everywhere germs. I wonder how many trade shows will get back on track
[00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:16.480]   This is gonna hurt the economy terribly Vegas is shut down and
[00:20:17.560 --> 00:20:20.000]   I wonder when it comes back. It will come back full-strength
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:27.360]   I wonder when the NBA and the NHL come back major league baseball come back if they will have the same size
[00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:33.880]   Audiences or people will just go hey, you know, it wasn't so bad not having a basketball game on every night
[00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:40.840]   It's gonna kill baseball. It's I'm sorry, but it's gonna kill baseball is sad
[00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:44.320]   He's like I have to be trapped inside and I don't have sports
[00:20:45.160 --> 00:20:51.400]   And the other part is he can't go play sports and that was a big part of his life. So that's hard
[00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:54.120]   What is it? What did he play? Okay?
[00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:56.120]   He's pickleball
[00:20:56.120 --> 00:21:01.960]   Okay, I don't know what that is, but I'm imagining this ball and there's a pickle
[00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:09.600]   No, it's a it's like a imagine kind of a tennis court slightly smaller than a tennis court and you're playing with like a ping-pong
[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:12.560]   paddle in a wiffle ball
[00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:18.760]   And that I miss my pickleball - hey, it's a good sport
[00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:23.640]   Play it forever. It's not super competitive. You play pickleball every day
[00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:27.960]   He plays out like four or five times a week. Yeah, it's it's good exercise
[00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:30.800]   Well, I mean he exercised too. It's just
[00:21:30.800 --> 00:21:37.240]   You know like I mean anybody who goes around and like likes to shoot hoops and stuff like that. You just it's camaraderie
[00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:40.240]   It looks kind of slow
[00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:46.560]   And you watch it pickleball video now. Yeah, it's kind of a nice pace. It is it is a good pace
[00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:49.640]   I mean it again. I called it less competitive. It's good
[00:21:49.640 --> 00:21:51.720]   but
[00:21:51.720 --> 00:21:57.520]   Yeah, this is he actually oh, yeah, it was invented on Bainbridge, but my husband
[00:21:57.520 --> 00:22:04.480]   Oh my god, he's you're in pickleball headquarters. Pickleball HQ. Oh, this is America's fastest growing sport apparently
[00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:07.240]   It's America's lowest fastest for his boy
[00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:11.200]   It's more complicated than it looks it's tennis
[00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:17.240]   I'm awful at every sport I would and just a tennis fan is it is a smaller quarter is it? That's a tennis court
[00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:21.060]   It I think it's a little bit smaller than a tennis court
[00:22:21.060 --> 00:22:25.760]   Or maybe it's much more. It's very portlandia. I gotta say
[00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:33.920]   It's a good game for everybody. How's that? Oh, that's good. Yeah, go fun for all the family
[00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:39.320]   And you're six feet apart. So we used to play something like that. Well, but you can't play it because everyone touches that ball
[00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:41.960]   Yeah, no, no, you can't yeah, yeah
[00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:45.040]   Unless you sanitized in between serves
[00:22:45.040 --> 00:22:47.760]   Well
[00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:49.760]   Okay, yeah
[00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:55.840]   Yeah, I watched a spoon in Purell this
[00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:06.640]   Evaporates it's actually fine. I'm here to tell you I survived. I had some soup you think I brought my I'm bringing my water from home
[00:23:06.640 --> 00:23:12.800]   I'm bringing my food from home. Normally. I bring a utensil. I didn't so I went out to the communal kitchen. I
[00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:16.640]   With a paper tissue got this spoon
[00:23:16.640 --> 00:23:21.040]   Put your rail Purell in it and clean is it their dishwashing
[00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:26.200]   Decursion out there at the same it involved washing the spoon and I'd be touching a lot more things
[00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:31.440]   Sponge is about your logic seems a little flawed. Yes, I'm filthy
[00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:39.360]   But you wash your hands as you use your hands your fingers. Yes, and washer hands at the same time Purell really worked
[00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:44.000]   I'm just I'm gonna say it wasn't a dirty spoon. It was in the you know, it was in the silver
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:50.120]   It again. Yeah, I know I'm like what if you get the the Purell spoon? It doesn't eat some maybe
[00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:55.440]   It evaporates. There's no okay. Maybe there's a thin film of aloe vera gel on it, but
[00:23:56.320 --> 00:24:01.600]   You're your tongue feels so sued. I have I mean, this is crazy
[00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:06.080]   This is neurotic, but I have been microwaving the sponge every day after I do the dishes
[00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:11.640]   You should have a dish brush man. What I guess is that was one of my things of the week
[00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:16.480]   Why is that cleaner? Well, I replaced the sponges. I have dozens of sponges in its sink
[00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:21.600]   But I'm not gonna use a new sponge every day. So I you every few days. I will replace the sponge brushes
[00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:24.960]   Alright, so here's a question that grow fewer bacteria really is that true?
[00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:29.920]   Yeah, sponge has to be the worst sponges the petri did a dish of the kitchen
[00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:34.000]   So what's the most erotic thing you're doing or thinking during all this erotic
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.360]   No, a lot tick
[00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:43.760]   Yeah, I know there's a lot of neuroses come up, don't they
[00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:48.960]   Yeah, what's um you I'll think why you tell me because obviously you had something in your mind
[00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:52.000]   No, I don't that's what I was gonna see you how crazy I am
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:54.640]   I mean, I
[00:24:55.440 --> 00:24:56.400]   I
[00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:58.800]   I've got nothing because I'm not I'm not very
[00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:06.560]   I donated blood on Monday, which is not neurotic while I was there that is a light that is a beautiful thing to do
[00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:09.760]   You took your life in your hands to help somebody else
[00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:12.960]   Not really though
[00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:16.960]   I'm like they were very hyper sterilized like the woman
[00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:22.160]   I'm sure I'll tell you when they when I got there and they gave me that they were like and here's the tablet
[00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:25.280]   You've got to do all the answering questions thought I was like, oh hell no
[00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:29.440]   I like she she wiped the whole thing down. Is there a need for blood?
[00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:35.520]   Apparently Washington state had a shortage. I think it's because people don't go only donate what going yeah
[00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:38.960]   I gave I got when I got my gallon pin
[00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:44.560]   I said okay. I've done enough now, but I probably should go back to well. Maybe now gallons only eight
[00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:46.400]   donations
[00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:50.800]   Okay, I got a big bigger pin than that. I did about 30 or 40 donations. Oh, okay
[00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:54.720]   My 10 gallon pin or something. I don't know because it's a
[00:25:54.720 --> 00:25:57.680]   Test you
[00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:02.320]   No, they don't test you for coronavirus if I have a fever let's see today's I donated Monday
[00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:09.440]   So if I have a fever or start feeling ill before Friday, I'm to call them. Oh interesting. Oh, that's interesting. Okay. All right
[00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:16.080]   They don't okay, but they don't know if coronavirus is transmitted. Yeah, yeah, they don't know
[00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:22.480]   I mean, the scientific stuff is just absolutely fascinating
[00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:26.640]   But how they're figuring this out. I just got yelled up by somebody on Twitter that you know a journalist
[00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:31.120]   You're not going to do this this raw information. You can't do this. You have to filter it. No people can figure this out
[00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:38.320]   Nobody knows what's going on yet. There's there's little dribs and drabs there has been a lot of misinformation though
[00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:43.760]   Oh, yeah, of course Facebook, but uh, what's app especially what's app's been used
[00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:51.680]   Um, there is a article going around and I have yet to be able to find confirmation that says the world health organization says
[00:26:51.680 --> 00:26:54.000]   Don't use ibuprofen
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:59.200]   If you need are you're treating a covid infection there were in france
[00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:06.160]   They take ibuprofen more than in other countries and there's a fear read, but that's all it is not enough data yet
[00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:10.800]   Uh, but hold on. Did I just did the who updated yesterday?
[00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:16.560]   Uh, science alert is that what you know site that no, that's the problem. That's the one site
[00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:23.040]   No one has found corroborating information. Yeah, just a minister in france, right?
[00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:30.320]   Wasn't it? I don't trust the french ministers. Oh my goodness, but it's all coming from the science. It's not the minister of art and culture
[00:27:30.320 --> 00:27:35.280]   Tesla is in fremont
[00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:40.640]   fremont is in san eclair county shelter in place order they have deemed
[00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:43.440]   auto manufacturer is non-essential
[00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:51.760]   They they have told tesla you need to shut down tesla apparently in defiance of the order continues to operate the factory
[00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:54.560]   Of course he does
[00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:58.480]   That's that's what i'm actually super worried about there there are places
[00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:03.600]   Even restaurants who in certain parts of the country who are like, yeah
[00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:09.600]   We're not gonna listen to you. Well you understand it's a it's a existential economically existential threat
[00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:14.320]   I do I I'm not unaware of that. I mean my my brother is a
[00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:19.200]   waiter. That's what he does is living. Yeah, um, but
[00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:26.240]   I mean you can't just say I mean the government has said you need to do this
[00:28:26.240 --> 00:28:30.400]   For a reasonable reason. It's not like, you know
[00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:36.880]   Quartering soldiers in your house or something horrifying. Um, that was sarcastic. Um
[00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:40.160]   So yeah, I I think
[00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:47.440]   Are you going to bring out police? Are we gonna have citizens who you know want to fight for their right to own their restaurant? I hope not
[00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:49.600]   That's very scary. Yeah
[00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:52.480]   Um
[00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:54.080]   A lot of charter
[00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:57.280]   Employees very upset because charter is not letting workers
[00:28:57.280 --> 00:29:02.960]   Work from home. They are I guess an essential industry and they sent out
[00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:06.480]   An email on friday
[00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:10.640]   Saying you can't work from home. You gotta come in
[00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:16.560]   I think so. I mean well so there. I mean if you are a lineman
[00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:22.000]   Or if you're definitely charged our our engineers have to come in they can't push the buttons at home
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:28.080]   That really that really takes everything that kevin does and makes it
[00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:30.960]   Pretty late you can't push the buttons at home
[00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:36.880]   Kevin Kevin Kevin doesn't at home kevin does it at home, but you have fewer buttons
[00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:43.040]   We have more buttons. This is look at how you see it. You can't could you do could kevin do that at home? I don't think so
[00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:50.480]   Of course, there's bad behavior of all kinds
[00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:55.760]   There is a soft bank patent troll. Did you see this in tector mike maznick?
[00:29:55.760 --> 00:30:01.360]   Yeah, is this the testing patent troll or is this the ventilator patent troll? Well, there's both
[00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:06.800]   Oh both. Oh gee. Yeah, so the the soft bank owned patent
[00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:08.480]   troll
[00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:12.240]   Apparently bought up a bunch of tharanos patents when they went bankrupt
[00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:15.200]   And they're asking
[00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:17.520]   one of the testing companies
[00:30:17.520 --> 00:30:19.600]   to halt all tests
[00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:22.000]   Because it's a patent violation now
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:28.800]   They have come back ever since the publicity and said oh no no you can keep doing the covet 19 tests. It's just the other tests
[00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:33.920]   I love the register headline tharanos vampire lives on
[00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:38.800]   And then this is the 3d printed valve. So
[00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:41.600]   This is fun
[00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:47.600]   There's a a company that makes ventilators that charges 11 thousand dollars
[00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:51.200]   for a replacement valve in the ventilator
[00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:53.760]   Italian hospital had run out
[00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:56.640]   Uh, they went around they found a tech
[00:30:56.640 --> 00:31:01.680]   A tech company CEO who said ah we could 3d print these
[00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:07.600]   He didn't release the 3d models, but he reverse engineered 3d models and for one buck each
[00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:10.400]   printed 100 of these valves
[00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:17.040]   Now, uh the company that sells the valves for 11 thousand dollars
[00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:20.320]   Is upset
[00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:23.440]   Maybe even suing on patent infringement
[00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:27.280]   Uh instead of doing the right thing which would be to put out the 3d
[00:31:27.280 --> 00:31:31.520]   Files so others could do the do it if they need the valve
[00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:36.160]   And i'm betting their argument is something about fda approval compliance and safety
[00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:41.600]   Well, and that's what changes now. This is in italy so they don't care about but that's exactly the point in fact
[00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:43.840]   That's you know these this is this 3m
[00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:50.080]   N95 mask is intended for carpenters and others who uh have sawdust in the air and they don't want to breathe it
[00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:56.000]   The fda has loosened its rules and said yeah medical personnel because there's such a shortage can use
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:58.080]   Some of these
[00:31:58.080 --> 00:32:02.720]   I mean, I think doing the valves is a is a fun and wonderful thing, but i've also seen i put this on the rundown
[00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:10.560]   There's a open source medical devices group and you know, I get the maker culture, but making ventilators people are honestly trying to
[00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:14.000]   You know clued together ventilators. I don't think so
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:19.120]   I think we need a you know, we need the auto makers under federal supervision making the ventilators
[00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:22.880]   Not three guys in the garage. Yeah, um
[00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:27.040]   I don't know if you don't have a ventilator and the choice is between not having one
[00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:30.560]   I know a homemade one
[00:32:30.560 --> 00:32:37.280]   A remade Chrysler give me the homemade one. I'll take I'll take that if the if you need a ventilator
[00:32:37.280 --> 00:32:41.520]   Yeah
[00:32:41.520 --> 00:32:43.600]   Um
[00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:45.520]   Universal pictures is going to release
[00:32:45.520 --> 00:32:50.400]   I know you were worried stacy because you and your daughter were so excited about seeing trolls world
[00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:52.720]   tour in the theater
[00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:57.280]   Yes, yes, that was that was up there with it, but you know what I am excited to see what
[00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:03.200]   Mulan and disney plus we just got it. So I'm like the live action Mulan
[00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:08.480]   Yeah, I but disney has not said they're going to release it, but I really want them to because I really wanted to see it
[00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:14.480]   So universal NBC universal, which is owned by the fine company. We know as Comcast
[00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:20.400]   Uh is going to release three movies that were scheduled for release
[00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:24.960]   The hunt which was scheduled on the 13th the invisible man
[00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:28.720]   Which was released end of the month of february, but no one went to see it because the theater is closed
[00:33:28.720 --> 00:33:35.120]   Emma was also released in february again. I want to see that but I want to see two. I know I'll come over
[00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:42.400]   Is too much we can what well this is what irks me and then troll trolls world tour april 10th. They'll all be released
[00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:44.400]   to um
[00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:49.920]   To stream but it's $20 and it's not you don't own it you're renting it for 48 hours
[00:33:51.120 --> 00:33:56.720]   Well, I would be okay with paying $12 for that just for my ticket kind of that thinking
[00:33:56.720 --> 00:34:02.880]   Yeah, but I guess they figure you're gonna bring your daughter. That'd be 25 bucks to the theater. So yeah, nobody wants to come with me
[00:34:02.880 --> 00:34:06.720]   And I guess how much of that actually goes to the to the
[00:34:06.720 --> 00:34:10.240]   Um, it depends on if you go on opening night
[00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:19.040]   What is the deal with movie tickets the the the if you go if you go during opening weekend more of the revenue goes towards the theater owner
[00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:25.920]   Oh interesting and then after that it goes to the studio. Yes, but the theater operator just gets it on the $20 popcorn
[00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:28.880]   Wait, um, yes. What Jeff did you ask me?
[00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:33.280]   So do you need to do what the proportion is because because what i'm saying is if if I mean the theater is not cut out
[00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:35.680]   Right the distributors cut out
[00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:36.880]   so
[00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:40.960]   um to to look at the retail price of the movie theater and say they're trying to recoup that
[00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:44.640]   Is not a one for one? How much will they like they did?
[00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:48.000]   net for you from you at the
[00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:50.960]   um studio
[00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:58.640]   I like individually. I think they can pretend all right. What what what of that goes? So they get the whole price on opening day
[00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:02.720]   So what they're probably yeah, what they're probably doing is
[00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:07.280]   Well, I don't know what they're doing. Let's put it this way. You don't want to be a theater owner right now
[00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:14.720]   Yeah, and but they also this is to me. Let's let's go big go way out here
[00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:22.720]   You know the internet and let's look at journalism, right? It got rid of distribution, right? You you're no longer printing company printing press, right?
[00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:26.240]   Distribution was no longer your value ad as a newspaper
[00:35:26.240 --> 00:35:28.880]   uh
[00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:33.200]   It got rid of the middleman and it's it's in this process of figuring we're still figuring that out
[00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:37.760]   What this is going to do is accelerate the elimination of the middleman in a lot of ways
[00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:42.880]   So think about something like toilet paper, which apparently is near and dear to americans heart
[00:35:43.600 --> 00:35:49.520]   Kimberly clark which makes which who's there who is that which brand is are they charmin or they the other one?
[00:35:49.520 --> 00:35:55.840]   Kimberly clark which makes diapers toilet paper all kinds of personal care clinics to don't they they make Kleenex?
[00:35:55.840 --> 00:36:01.440]   They have been experimenting with a direct to the consumer model in diapers
[00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:04.240]   but imagine
[00:36:04.240 --> 00:36:06.640]   I want my toilet paper direct from the factory
[00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:13.680]   There's there's there's a possibility of something like that here and i'm laughing because chicken head 21's near and dear to your rear
[00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:18.480]   Um, they they make scott scott's toilet paper scott's toilet paper
[00:36:18.480 --> 00:36:25.120]   So imagine being able to to sign up for a cotton nail because cotton nail is better than scott's toilet paper scott is for the
[00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:27.840]   The employer who doesn't really care about their employees
[00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:33.120]   Exactly but wants to save money with a thousand sheet roll of one blind toilet paper
[00:36:34.080 --> 00:36:39.440]   Which is I always feel it means that you don't value women in your organization because women always have to use toilet
[00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:41.200]   That's absolutely right. The point here
[00:36:41.200 --> 00:36:44.720]   Is that we're going to see a lot of businesses
[00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:52.640]   Have the opportunity after this in the experience now of cutting out the middleman, which I think is going to fundamentally change the economy
[00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:58.000]   Well, we've already seen that. I mean half our advertisers are right to consumer
[00:36:58.880 --> 00:37:03.520]   Yeah, that's that's like the internet thing. I know casper harries
[00:37:03.520 --> 00:37:06.160]   So next we're gonna have the paper club
[00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:07.840]   Yeah
[00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:13.040]   Come on. You can advertise it if you win. We've yeah, we've got an audience that's dying for your product
[00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:15.040]   You can just come on and advertise
[00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:19.680]   Gonna go for it now email. Lisa at artisanal agency.com. Thank you very much
[00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:23.360]   Well, honestly
[00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:25.840]   That's kind of what's happened is a number of our
[00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:31.680]   Especially consumer advertisers have last minute said, you know, we're out of here
[00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:36.640]   Uh, and but what's survived about you. Yeah, it's a little bit of a problem
[00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:40.960]   What survived though interestingly? I think is the more the business to business stuff
[00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:44.480]   And I think we're I don't know why I mean if you make
[00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:47.040]   you know
[00:37:47.040 --> 00:37:52.720]   Why is it hello fresher or uh, yeah, we're in going crazy. What is opportunity
[00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:58.880]   Or zoom or I mean you could think of it dozens of businesses that actually will thrive in this
[00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:01.520]   Of course, we can think of a lot of people who aren't in fact
[00:38:01.520 --> 00:38:06.080]   I really shouldn't feel bad for the movie theater owners. It's the kid behind the counter selling the popcorn action
[00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:12.480]   We're about uh those people well, not a lot of people want that job or have that job
[00:38:12.480 --> 00:38:18.160]   I mean you can feel sad for that kid who loses their job. They probably are. What are you gonna do, right?
[00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:20.960]   Well, you can work in an Amazon warehouse
[00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:24.160]   100 000 new jobs. There's an example
[00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:28.320]   Amazon also says we're gonna prioritize essential products
[00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:31.040]   over, you know
[00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:33.040]   I don't know what the chia pets
[00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:37.840]   Uh, and they're hiring a hundred thousand new of workers for their factories
[00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:41.520]   That's wild
[00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:45.280]   Yeah, that's what I told my brother to go to it's mostly well
[00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:49.360]   So it depends on the factory. They're also increasing the pay by two dollars an hour in the us
[00:38:51.120 --> 00:38:53.920]   uh, a lot of the shifts available are overnight and
[00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:57.920]   But you could kind of feel like you're helping people too though, right? You're mean
[00:38:57.920 --> 00:39:00.880]   It's vital. It says
[00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:03.440]   Vital yeah
[00:39:03.440 --> 00:39:04.880]   I feel that
[00:39:04.880 --> 00:39:08.720]   Well, I have a lot of questions about Amazon and their treatment of workers and I
[00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:12.160]   Well, I think that they're one of the reasons they're doing this a because they need it
[00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:13.920]   But b because it
[00:39:13.920 --> 00:39:18.480]   This is looks like you're a good member of the community your years they even say in their blog post
[00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:21.360]   Uh, a lot of people are out of work
[00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:25.440]   Full in part-time positions across the us and our fulfillment centers
[00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:30.960]   We know many people have been economically impacted as jobs in areas like hospitality restaurants and travel
[00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:34.560]   Are lost or furloughed? We want those people to know we welcome them
[00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:41.360]   On our teams until things return to normal and their past employer is able to bring them back. That sounds pretty darn good
[00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:44.640]   It does I I applaud amazon's pr
[00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:47.200]   But this is they need the people
[00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:51.520]   They're putting the nicest gloss on it and they're hoping to get credit for it
[00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:53.920]   And can I just say?
[00:39:53.920 --> 00:40:00.880]   Given the governments and typically towards the tech companies going into this and where we are now the tech companies look
[00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:05.280]   Just covered in glitter except for facebook. Yes. All right face. You could
[00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:14.480]   You could give facebook an opportunity to look good on a platter and facebook would still like take the platter throw everything off of it
[00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:18.320]   Stomp on it and then run away. It makes you think maybe they really are evil
[00:40:18.320 --> 00:40:21.120]   God they're the most no, they're just
[00:40:21.120 --> 00:40:23.920]   There's probably evil. I mean, they're just in competently evil
[00:40:23.920 --> 00:40:27.520]   No, they're competently evil. They're uncompidently good
[00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:32.160]   So back to your amazon point for a second. We'll get to facebook again later. I'm sure
[00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:34.560]   uh, new jersey
[00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:39.520]   Uh crashed the website for unemployment benefits with a record number of 15 000 applications
[00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:42.480]   Wow. Yeah, a lot of people losing jobs
[00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:45.360]   expect 20% unemployment rate
[00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:47.520]   Uh
[00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:50.800]   Gramercy part was a grammacy park restaurants. Is that one of those you didn't you didn't square restaurant?
[00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:56.240]   What a big restaurant company in New York. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. 80% gone 2000 jobs gone. My god
[00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:59.600]   Oh, so hard
[00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:02.800]   I mean, I'm very privileged
[00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:04.640]   um
[00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:06.640]   to have tenure
[00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:12.160]   Well, and a lot of graduate students are complaining because they're being made to come in to work
[00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:14.400]   uh
[00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:20.080]   Well, graduate students have always been always the most of the universe of the education
[00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:28.080]   Right, but i'm also seeing some in other words, i'm not surprised terrible, but i'm not surprised. What are they doing? Graydon papers? What are they doing?
[00:41:28.080 --> 00:41:35.280]   I don't know. They're not teaching classes. No, they're not. No, we're doing everything remotely now. I'm what i'm seeing too though is i'm seeing in in my twitter
[00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:38.400]   Feed i'm seeing phd students
[00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:42.560]   Who were scared to death because they had research projects they have to leave now
[00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:48.080]   Right. Um, they had a band of timetable and uh in the sciences
[00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:51.120]   Um, they don't know what to do. Meanwhile, italy took i think
[00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:55.680]   Some a huge number like 20 000 medical students and said, okay, you're in
[00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:58.960]   Without taking the test. We need you now
[00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:02.000]   um
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:06.640]   Washington state is having phd students and anyone you know with lab experience
[00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:12.640]   They're low they're asking for them to come and do testing. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that makes a lot of sense
[00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:16.880]   Uh
[00:42:16.880 --> 00:42:22.080]   Misinformation is a problem. This is an opportunity for facebook and others to step up. What's app?
[00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:25.120]   Uh because it's so widely used worldwide
[00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:28.000]   Uh, and it kind of allows these group messaging
[00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:33.920]   Uh, and it has been a source of a lot of misinformation and it's a little harder to control than then
[00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:36.640]   You know something like twitter or facebook
[00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:40.240]   Because you can't sometimes can't even see the message i've had to like my
[00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:44.480]   Some of my what's app chains they're like worse than facebook
[00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:48.960]   I mean i've just been and like someone will post something and then someone else is like hey
[00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:54.400]   That was actually debunked on snopes and then the other person will be like what is snopes and then there's this education prospect
[00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:56.640]   and you're just like it's like
[00:42:57.440 --> 00:42:59.440]   your grandma meets your
[00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:02.240]   Crazy uncle meets
[00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:07.760]   Like you're a science friend and then there's always like the weird like anti-vaxxer type
[00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:10.800]   You know, oh, yeah, and then there's haralda ruevera
[00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:13.680]   Who's spread the?
[00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:17.760]   Phoney facebook meme that oh you could tell if you have covet if you can hold your breath for 10 seconds
[00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:19.520]   You don't have it
[00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:24.720]   That happened that was on my what's app chat course it was my father sent it to me. I said um
[00:43:25.920 --> 00:43:27.520]   dad
[00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:32.480]   But you know what and be it's nice to be cool. I didn't send it to the whole list
[00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:35.280]   I said it to my father
[00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:40.960]   And he sent out a message saying i'm sorry. I saw this on facebook. I hate facebook. I this is wrong. Don't believe it
[00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:45.440]   In an i'm gonna tell me a facebook story from last night. Hold on
[00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:52.640]   Let me read this statement from the facebook newsroom a joint industry statement from facebook google linked in microsoft red at twitter and youtube
[00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:58.080]   Uh, we are working closely together on covet 19 response efforts
[00:43:58.080 --> 00:44:04.560]   We're helping millions of people stay connected while also jointly combating fraud and misinformation about the virus
[00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:11.040]   Elevating authoritative content on our platforms and sharing critical updates and coordination with government health care
[00:44:11.040 --> 00:44:16.240]   Agencies around the world. We invite other companies to join us as we keep our communities healthy and safe
[00:44:16.240 --> 00:44:21.120]   That is about literally about the least you could do is put out that tweet
[00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:25.120]   But all of them did it together. Well now I feel better
[00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:29.120]   So I guess it's what they could agree to they all agreed
[00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:32.160]   What was a bad idea?
[00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:33.680]   um
[00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:35.360]   the uh
[00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:41.760]   During an address at the munich security conference february 15th a month before uh, this was declared a pandemic
[00:44:41.760 --> 00:44:45.840]   um, the world health organizations director general said
[00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:54.240]   Disinformation is as dangerous as the virus. We're not just fighting an epidemic. We're fighting an infodemic. I like that word. Oh
[00:44:54.240 --> 00:45:00.160]   Well, he's greek. Oh no here comes here comes moral panic except this is this is
[00:45:00.160 --> 00:45:04.160]   Information that's just that's just offensive to the year
[00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:10.000]   Infodemic fake news spreads faster and more easily than this virus and is just as dangerous
[00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:16.800]   But again a lot of this is lip service until these companies the promise is very hard for companies
[00:45:16.800 --> 00:45:18.480]   to
[00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:21.760]   To find ways to stem this tide. They've created such
[00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:24.480]   uh low friction platforms
[00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:29.120]   Anybody can post anything anytime and and there's billions of yeah
[00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:34.160]   It's up to people it's up to people to learn who to pay attention to and not pay attention to survey after survey
[00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:36.720]   After surveys is people don't trust what they read on social media
[00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:41.120]   Just good good. Wonderful. Yeah, it's great. That means they're discerning
[00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:43.360]   um
[00:45:43.360 --> 00:45:49.600]   um, but stuff goes on. I you know, I just get yelled at because I I by somebody a journalist because I
[00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:56.080]   Retweeted a scientist who had this small test using malaria drug in france
[00:45:56.080 --> 00:46:01.680]   And in 16 cases because it's all he had saw some difference and he tweeted that out and that was interesting
[00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:03.920]   Well, you shouldn't be putting that out people think this is nothing that
[00:46:03.920 --> 00:46:08.960]   Jesus you guys at some point you got to say people can get a little judge elan musk
[00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:11.120]   then
[00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:12.080]   tweeted
[00:46:12.080 --> 00:46:15.680]   Oh clara quinine. It's the solution with that any kind of
[00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:22.720]   Everybody's going to uh hoard it. So now the uk is already passed a regulation that they can't you can't hoard it or export it
[00:46:22.720 --> 00:46:25.360]   So they can hoard it
[00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:26.800]   um
[00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:31.120]   Yeah, this is but this so it's a it really is exactly what happens in any crisis
[00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:32.960]   You have some malefactors who?
[00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:39.280]   You know take advantage of it. They hoard stuff. They scam people they try to sell silver solutions on tv
[00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:41.360]   that'll kill the virus
[00:46:41.360 --> 00:46:44.560]   um as jim baker did they tell evangelist
[00:46:44.560 --> 00:46:47.200]   uh, and then you but
[00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:50.720]   I think for the most part it in individuals and it's not
[00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:54.880]   Very public because it might be paul was talking about how in his cul-de-sac
[00:46:54.880 --> 00:47:01.680]   One woman who had who bought a lot of stuff. She was a couponer opened her garage door and said in his cul-de-sac said any
[00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:07.920]   A lot of older people anybody who needs anything. I've got all the supplies come on in just take it out of my garage
[00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:10.320]   There's a lot of that too
[00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:12.800]   More of that, but you just this is not what newsworthy
[00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:17.440]   Don't you think there's at random acts of kindness happening all the time everywhere?
[00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:19.680]   I'm so 100% I just don't need blood dammit
[00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:22.240]   You don't need blood dammit
[00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:28.400]   And there's random acts of being this that are happening. I heard a horrible story. No, you're trying to break things up from the do-boutly
[00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:35.120]   No horrible stories. Don't tell us. Let me tell a kind story. Okay. You're gel jeff teleke horrible story
[00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:37.120]   And then you will be
[00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:42.880]   In a note so jeff is covet 19 and you are chloroquine. Okay. Go ahead jeff
[00:47:42.880 --> 00:47:46.160]   No, just a friend of my colleague of mine
[00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:49.040]   Went down to pay their their cleaning person
[00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:53.920]   Who needs the money desperately and the cleaning person said oh, thank you. Thank god
[00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:56.640]   Another client
[00:47:56.640 --> 00:48:00.000]   Screamed and started to spread the spray stuff on the process jesus
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:04.400]   Right and that's all right. Nothing to do the internet people can just be horrendous
[00:48:05.200 --> 00:48:07.920]   A-holes. Yeah. Oh now I have two nice stories
[00:48:07.920 --> 00:48:12.800]   We are asking our cleaning person not to come but we are playing her as are we by the way
[00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:18.080]   I want to stand up. Yeah, good all three of us. That's good. So because if you're listening to a cleaning person
[00:48:18.080 --> 00:48:20.240]   You probably should treat them well
[00:48:20.240 --> 00:48:24.240]   Uh, okay. So that's one and then two is
[00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:33.520]   The the efforts by people to buy gift cards to restaurants and there there are several efforts to
[00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:38.560]   Make it easy to see restaurants in your areas and get them online and buy a great idea
[00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:41.280]   And then when it's over you'll go out to eat
[00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:44.080]   Yes, and then also if you're
[00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:47.760]   Worried that maybe the restaurant will be out of business in your gift card is nothing
[00:48:47.760 --> 00:48:51.200]   Which is a legit worry and if you don't have a lot of income that makes sense
[00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:54.480]   You can also some people are buying
[00:48:54.480 --> 00:48:58.560]   Uh food and getting takeout for hospital workers
[00:48:58.560 --> 00:49:01.440]   Nice. There you go
[00:49:02.080 --> 00:49:07.920]   Those are two very nice. We got all pitch in. Meanwhile, let's do a little pickle ball interval
[00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:13.120]   A little interlude. I have some just let's just watch some pickle ball
[00:49:13.120 --> 00:49:15.840]   It's a great sport
[00:49:15.840 --> 00:49:20.800]   And it's something we're all going to be doing between every between every uh match they come off to explain it
[00:49:20.800 --> 00:49:25.840]   They say let me tell you what you just saw. Let's watch a little more a little more pickle ball
[00:49:25.840 --> 00:49:28.880]   So like a ball to go
[00:49:28.880 --> 00:49:31.840]   Andrew is a
[00:49:32.080 --> 00:49:37.920]   Word winning pickle ball player is a champion. Oh my god. He's not a professional. He's a major
[00:49:37.920 --> 00:49:42.000]   You must be so proud. I did get a professional pickle ball player once and it was completely
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:44.960]   There's no professional pickle ball. There is professional pickle ball
[00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:48.320]   And I had no idea and this was at a conference
[00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:52.560]   And one of the speakers was introduced as a professional pickle ball player and I was just like
[00:49:52.560 --> 00:49:55.520]   what
[00:49:55.520 --> 00:49:59.120]   Professional pickle ball player
[00:50:00.240 --> 00:50:02.240]   Andrew Higginbotham
[00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:04.640]   You know, I would like to okay
[00:50:04.640 --> 00:50:06.560]   Should be
[00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:08.800]   Mr. Higginbotham. That's what I call him
[00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:15.520]   Uh, google has also in depth. There are conferences after I couldn't even go through the whole list of conferences
[00:50:15.520 --> 00:50:18.560]   It have been oh delayed canceled. We'll start streaming
[00:50:18.560 --> 00:50:23.280]   Uh the cloud next conference which they were going to do digital now that you said i'll screw it
[00:50:23.280 --> 00:50:28.000]   Nobody wants this anyway, and then it's not going to do it
[00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:32.800]   Um game developer conference will be going on right now in san francisco. It's not people are streaming
[00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:36.080]   um
[00:50:36.080 --> 00:50:41.760]   As a as a speaker I have been both postponed now
[00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:46.400]   So my it's sad from our revenue perspective, but people are still optimistic
[00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:48.960]   And then I have turned into a digital
[00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:53.760]   Speaker at another conference. Oh, that's good. Well, you're set to do that
[00:50:53.760 --> 00:50:55.760]   I don't know about that
[00:50:55.760 --> 00:51:01.200]   You know one thing that bothers me though. I see this a lot. Well, uh, we're gonna postpone until april first
[00:51:01.200 --> 00:51:09.520]   Yeah, really most most people are postponing until november or this could be a really busy october. Yeah
[00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:15.200]   Yeah, but so I will tell you guys I up until last night
[00:51:15.200 --> 00:51:21.600]   Was evaluating doing a conference in september in austin was going to announce it at some point in time
[00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:25.120]   But everything was going but I just I pulled the plus
[00:51:25.120 --> 00:51:29.120]   Yeah, this is what you mentioned last week. Oh, i'm sorry stacey
[00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:35.440]   So i'm sorry i'm real bummed that just given that's wise you don't want to be on the news for that
[00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:37.520]   And you don't know what's going to happen this fall
[00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:43.520]   Well, and here's what seems to be happening until we have so this is this is what this this video did in the britain thing
[00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:45.840]   is
[00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:49.840]   Hide immunity doesn't work because the best way to go hide immunity is is
[00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:52.480]   injections hurt her demean right hurt
[00:51:52.480 --> 00:51:56.000]   Yeah herd immunity, sorry, okay
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:58.480]   The hide amendment again, I know
[00:51:58.480 --> 00:52:01.520]   You know, you're saying it against the hide amendment. I just want you to know
[00:52:01.520 --> 00:52:07.520]   So so so the problem is that that
[00:52:07.520 --> 00:52:09.040]   um
[00:52:09.040 --> 00:52:14.880]   We will if we all tamp down will do a good job, but then when we start coming back out people will get it again
[00:52:15.440 --> 00:52:17.600]   And then we'll get tamped down again and it's going to be it's going to be a
[00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:20.720]   In oscillation until such time as we have a vaccination
[00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:26.560]   And so we met a year off. They did the first human trials. Yes a couple of days ago, which means
[00:52:26.560 --> 00:52:29.920]   They have to wait and watch her for a year
[00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:34.640]   Before it's safe to use in humans and then they can start mass production
[00:52:34.640 --> 00:52:38.960]   So you're saying you're saying we're stuck in this for a year
[00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:43.760]   Well, we could be we could be in pretty good shape in july, but then uh-oh here it starts again
[00:52:43.840 --> 00:52:45.840]   Get you go back into your homes
[00:52:45.840 --> 00:52:49.920]   Uh, and it may be an oscillation is one theory. So we'll be in and out
[00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:55.440]   There's two really good things to read on that and here. I'll put them in the rundown
[00:52:55.440 --> 00:52:59.120]   Copy I can do this
[00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:02.640]   Maybe
[00:53:02.640 --> 00:53:08.080]   Where should I put them in the rundown? I never had them in chat. Oh chat. Yeah
[00:53:08.080 --> 00:53:11.440]   It's a little easier for everybody
[00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:15.600]   Um, okay. Tell us about these these things. Did I put them at no?
[00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:19.840]   I put them in Elizabeth Warren says facebook has reported what how did I do that?
[00:53:19.840 --> 00:53:23.120]   Okay, I will just tell you about them
[00:53:23.120 --> 00:53:29.600]   Um one is a twitter thread. I'll just go one is the new york times if you give me information
[00:53:29.600 --> 00:53:31.600]   Yeah, you probably find the page. Sorry
[00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:34.160]   What is the opinion article the coronavirus is here to stay?
[00:53:34.160 --> 00:53:41.200]   So what happens next written by an oncologist a medical ethic and medical ethicist an epidemiologist a biostatistian
[00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:48.720]   And that is exactly what jeff was talking about and then the other is a twitter thread on the imperial college report on covet 19
[00:53:48.720 --> 00:53:52.800]   Which by and this is by jeremy c young
[00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:58.400]   Which is our excellent thread as I remember that one. Yes. Yeah, here's the thread. I'll pop the thread is in the
[00:53:58.400 --> 00:54:00.720]   the
[00:54:00.720 --> 00:54:03.440]   Chat is also good since you're in the chat room. That's actually yeah
[00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:06.720]   The this place that I'm waving at thing
[00:54:06.720 --> 00:54:08.560]   Yeah
[00:54:08.560 --> 00:54:14.080]   And then the new so together those things that thread plus the report if you want to read the report
[00:54:14.080 --> 00:54:20.080]   So this is the report that said what england had thought to do this herd immunity thing you were talking about jeff didn't work
[00:54:20.080 --> 00:54:23.200]   Wasn't gonna work the problem was they had they used the wrong data
[00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:27.200]   They used it just kind of a general flu data of how many would be need to be hospitalized
[00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:31.360]   And they quickly saw that their hospitals were going to be badly overrun
[00:54:31.360 --> 00:54:36.160]   If people were out there just mucks it around say oh, let's all get sick because it'll happen we get over with faster
[00:54:36.400 --> 00:54:44.000]   Yeah, and they realized and the problem and scientists in the uk were having to fit because they were not revealing any of their thinking behind this policy
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:50.720]   So the scientists had nothing to react to and nothing to correct and so that that imperial college paper came out
[00:54:50.720 --> 00:54:55.520]   And that was that but it said I think young says same thing happened to the us
[00:54:55.520 --> 00:55:01.520]   That's why there was a lot more kind of panic in the us and saying oh, oh, we're closing down
[00:55:01.520 --> 00:55:03.920]   I am impressed though. Aren't you by
[00:55:04.480 --> 00:55:08.640]   Well, you mentioned governor quomo in new york, but our governor gavin nousaman
[00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:15.200]   The local authorities who all know how i just said, you know, we're not going to wait for a federal instruction
[00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:18.400]   We're just going to do it. I actually I think that's the way it should work
[00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:21.920]   Thank you governor in sleigh. Yeah jin sleigh
[00:55:21.920 --> 00:55:26.480]   Yeah, he's been doing a good job. I just say that I am so glad I am not in texas because
[00:55:26.480 --> 00:55:28.320]   Wow
[00:55:28.320 --> 00:55:32.000]   I mean they're they're getting austin's fine, but john cornin today and
[00:55:32.480 --> 00:55:36.240]   You know john abbot the governor is he john abbot? I can't remember
[00:55:36.240 --> 00:55:38.880]   You
[00:55:38.880 --> 00:55:44.800]   Wipe that dust that dust off your hands and use it when he said i'm by by texas. I am not I am gone
[00:55:44.800 --> 00:55:56.960]   So so they're not doing much to well, yes, we also have pictures on the in florida of people on the beaches
[00:55:56.960 --> 00:56:02.400]   Enjoying the sunshine sharing there. She's and and the florida governor said i'm not shutting him down
[00:56:02.720 --> 00:56:04.720]   Yeah, fine
[00:56:04.720 --> 00:56:12.400]   I you know, I understand people like devan nous a california representative who said go have go have go eat out. We need your business
[00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:16.000]   uh, I understand that they they're looking at
[00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:19.280]   kind of an invisible epidemic and
[00:56:19.280 --> 00:56:25.760]   weighing that with the clear economic consequences of shutting all these places down and saying well
[00:56:25.760 --> 00:56:28.240]   I know how bad you had
[00:56:29.280 --> 00:56:35.760]   Say you have certain media outlet shall we say listening to a certain single politician shall we say saying no
[00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:38.960]   That's not a big deal not a big deal and the disification
[00:56:38.960 --> 00:56:44.080]   They're tuned have they when you saw the washington post comparison. Yeah, it's phenomenal. Yeah
[00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:45.600]   I
[00:56:45.600 --> 00:56:46.640]   in-laws
[00:56:46.640 --> 00:56:50.720]   And my parents who a week and a half ago in credit, you know
[00:56:50.720 --> 00:56:55.280]   There are more cases I but we're very cavalier about this
[00:56:55.360 --> 00:57:00.000]   And now all of a sudden they've like switched their tune and they switch their tune pretty much in line with the
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:02.640]   our great leader
[00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:05.200]   So I understand that though because again
[00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:11.840]   You know, well, we only lost a few hundred people in a country of 300 million. What are you talking about?
[00:57:11.840 --> 00:57:15.040]   It's it's it's you have to have an imagination
[00:57:15.040 --> 00:57:17.760]   You have to have information
[00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:20.000]   It's it's have to have a heart
[00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:21.040]   Yeah
[00:57:21.040 --> 00:57:24.720]   I mean, but it's also a scary thing to do because what you're what you're saying is
[00:57:25.600 --> 00:57:28.800]   We're you know, we're gonna have 20% unemployment people are gonna be out of work
[00:57:28.800 --> 00:57:30.960]   People are gonna be starving people aren't gonna be able to pay rent
[00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:34.160]   There's gonna be an econ the airlines are gonna go out of business
[00:57:34.160 --> 00:57:38.720]   So I understand the hesitancy
[00:57:38.720 --> 00:57:40.560]   to
[00:57:40.560 --> 00:57:42.720]   You know pull the emergency break
[00:57:42.720 --> 00:57:46.480]   But at the same time look at look at italy. Yeah
[00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:51.520]   And and we are the numbers when you see the numbers we are tracking day for day
[00:57:52.240 --> 00:57:55.760]   to italy day for day and and versus
[00:57:55.760 --> 00:57:58.400]   South Korea
[00:57:58.400 --> 00:58:02.560]   Now by the way, let's let's be clear. I don't uh, and this is an amateur opinion, but
[00:58:02.560 --> 00:58:08.640]   China and Singapore and South Korea which have been in in Hong Kong which all have been in good shape
[00:58:08.640 --> 00:58:13.440]   You know may not stay in good shape. Right for lots of reasons right? It could be the new people were exposed
[00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:18.560]   There's there's some travel starts up. This is not a this is until we get a vaccination this ain't forever
[00:58:18.560 --> 00:58:21.040]   Uh, but there is a way
[00:58:21.120 --> 00:58:25.360]   To get this so that the problem in italy is people over a certain age. We're not far away from it
[00:58:25.360 --> 00:58:27.360]   Leo or being told we will not get better
[00:58:27.360 --> 00:58:29.680]   Yeah
[00:58:29.680 --> 00:58:36.480]   That's grandma and grandpa are gonna be sacrificed right that's serious stuff. Yeah
[00:58:36.480 --> 00:58:39.920]   Yeah, also the republican base
[00:58:39.920 --> 00:58:44.080]   Yeah, and the fox news audience. So yeah, there's a certain
[00:58:44.080 --> 00:58:50.240]   Irony all of that. Yeah, but uh, I don't want anybody to uh, you know our um
[00:58:51.200 --> 00:58:53.200]   At least his parents
[00:58:53.200 --> 00:58:56.720]   Uh, when when Lisa I think it was only a few days ago
[00:58:56.720 --> 00:59:00.240]   Said we were gonna shut down the studio and all this her mom laughed
[00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:02.880]   Come on. You don't take that seriously
[00:59:02.880 --> 00:59:05.360]   The very next day she started taking it seriously
[00:59:05.360 --> 00:59:12.080]   So it it does track very closely the president and fox news and what they're being told and I not surprised it
[00:59:12.080 --> 00:59:13.360]   You know
[00:59:13.360 --> 00:59:15.360]   If you have somebody you trust
[00:59:15.680 --> 00:59:21.120]   Rightly or wrongly and they tell you it's gonna be fine, especially because you want to believe it's gonna be fine
[00:59:21.120 --> 00:59:22.960]   I don't blame them
[00:59:22.960 --> 00:59:29.520]   Uh, they're getting miss they're not getting the information they need and even I knowing the you know all the information
[00:59:29.520 --> 00:59:32.960]   Well part too much information. Look out there and everything looks fine
[00:59:32.960 --> 00:59:36.160]   Nobody I know has died
[00:59:36.160 --> 00:59:42.960]   You know, tom hanks is coming home from the hospital. What are we worried about? I understand you kind of want to believe all that right?
[00:59:44.960 --> 00:59:48.960]   I just saw this morning at facebook is that I know is home and has it
[00:59:48.960 --> 00:59:54.720]   Um, I'm looking at these at the at my my twitter list and there are
[00:59:54.720 --> 01:00:02.080]   Really prominent people. Yeah in the field who've been treating people and as a result have gotten it because they don't have the proper equipment
[01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:06.720]   That's what I really feel for the health workers who are really getting it badly
[01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:09.440]   I guess because they're exposed multiple times
[01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:12.800]   Uh, they don't get a chance to recover. I'm not sure why but boy
[01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:18.640]   Well, the other problem is is there I've solved again. I'm a little knowledge dangerous thing. I don't know
[01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:21.280]   Jack about medicine
[01:00:21.280 --> 01:00:24.560]   But I asked questions when I don't know get it and I saw that
[01:00:24.560 --> 01:00:30.080]   Somebody was showing what they what they came out of doing an intubation and an intubation, you know, some patient scares me that
[01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:32.480]   um, and
[01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:35.040]   they're um skipping
[01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:37.280]   the
[01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:43.040]   um prior stage kind of thought the oxygen mask whatever respirator or whatever it is and going right to intubation for various
[01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:47.200]   Reasons that I can't explain but every time they do an intubation or extubation
[01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:53.520]   They're in they're in big medical workers are in huge risk. It's a shit. There's stuff. Sorry. Yeah fly and right
[01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:57.280]   Droplets fly it all over and we know it's infected
[01:00:57.280 --> 01:01:01.520]   And that's the kind of and they don't have I saw one doctor put up a picture himself
[01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:05.200]   He said this is the same mask and gown i've had for five days straight
[01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:06.960]   Uh
[01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:10.080]   Of course you're supposed to just party. It's time. Yes
[01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:14.000]   so there are
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:21.200]   Shockingly there are there are evil actors everywhere. There are people taking advantage of this there and then the range of
[01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:24.960]   uh kind of evil varies there's the
[01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:28.400]   hacker who created an andrate app
[01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:35.440]   That supposedly tells you if you've been exposed to the virus and instead locks your phone up for ransom
[01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:40.240]   And then there's the united states
[01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:43.200]   Senate
[01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:46.880]   I thought we're gonna talk about the guy who bought all the hand lotion or the yeah
[01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:49.600]   He's a poster boy, right the guy about all this
[01:01:49.600 --> 01:01:56.800]   I just I'm like I want to I want to hear from the reporter who got that guy to be the front page of the newspaper for that story
[01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:59.120]   Yeah
[01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:05.760]   I mean and then the people who use the overhead image to crowd source the location
[01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:11.840]   Yeah, that's a good example of uh, of course. I don't want to encourage that because how many times this has read it
[01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:16.320]   Discovered somebody they thought did something and it wasn't the right person
[01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:21.040]   The senate has is working on something they call the urnit act
[01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:26.800]   They are using the pull on every stop in misrepresentation and evil
[01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:29.680]   Out on this one the urnit act
[01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:32.880]   threatens section 230 protections
[01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:34.640]   for
[01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:40.000]   Companies like twitter facebook and others they have to earn those
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.560]   protection
[01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:48.560]   And the way they earn the protections is by showing a
[01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:55.920]   National commission on online child sexual exploitation prevention that they are doing
[01:02:55.920 --> 01:03:01.200]   The best practices so-called best practices which are determined by this committee
[01:03:01.680 --> 01:03:05.920]   For owners of internet platforms to prevent reduce and respond to child exploitation
[01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:15.360]   Now when uh, richard bloom install democrat of canatekitt was asked why he hated encryption he says there's not nothing about encryption in the urnit act
[01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:17.440]   uh
[01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:19.440]   Well
[01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:21.680]   They don't have to so this is
[01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:27.600]   You know nobody's promoting child exploitation. No everybody hates that
[01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:30.720]   But that doesn't really seem to be what this is about
[01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:37.840]   Uh, oh by the way, uh, if even if the committee says somebody's doing the best practices the attorney general
[01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:43.760]   Gets to decide and we know how general attorney general bar feels about encryption
[01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:50.480]   He says best practices to forced encrypted messaging systems to give law enforcement the keys
[01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:57.760]   So this bill from lindsey graham and dick bloomethall would give bar the power to man the tech companies obey him
[01:03:57.760 --> 01:04:00.480]   i'm reading from bruce snier's blog
[01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:03.520]   Uh, or face serious repercussions
[01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:10.720]   Including the civil and criminal liability they'd face if they lost protection under section 230
[01:04:10.720 --> 01:04:13.680]   What's app?
[01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:15.680]   signal facebook everybody
[01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:19.120]   Would have a choice either we're now suddenly liable
[01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:21.760]   Would imagine if you said to the phone company
[01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:26.800]   Uh, you're liable for every conversation that goes on over telephones
[01:04:26.800 --> 01:04:31.120]   Unless you just give record at all and give us the recordings to be here
[01:04:31.120 --> 01:04:33.680]   The phone companies have been very willing to give
[01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:35.280]   Yeah
[01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:37.440]   Data to the but they've never been liable
[01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:41.280]   So they just do it anyway. They nobody's forcing them to do it. They just do it anyway
[01:04:41.280 --> 01:04:47.360]   They're good. Notrias a good citizen. You could argue that that's why this is now being pushed to the fore
[01:04:47.360 --> 01:04:52.560]   Yes, because encrypted conversations even video and audio conversations over
[01:04:52.560 --> 01:04:54.720]   Uh, say what's app?
[01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:57.440]   Um, arb dark to law enforcement. They don't like that
[01:04:58.160 --> 01:05:01.200]   So they wish they could wiretap everything the thing the difference is
[01:05:01.200 --> 01:05:06.080]   Uh, when you go to the phone company, you have to have a lawful order
[01:05:06.080 --> 01:05:11.040]   You can't just say hey, can you give us that recording? You have to have a warrant, right?
[01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:14.720]   Um, this this would basically mean
[01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:19.040]   Well, we can get the encryption, but by the way, you got a weekend enough so that anybody else
[01:05:19.040 --> 01:05:23.920]   With a little bit of effort figure out how to listen in or hack
[01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:30.320]   Uh, it is a terrible bill and of course it's been proposed. It's uh in committee in committee now
[01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:34.800]   And I don't think the time so a they're using the age old
[01:05:34.800 --> 01:05:42.160]   Canard that think of the children, you know, this is to protect the children and be they're doing it when the nation is very much distracted
[01:05:42.160 --> 01:05:45.360]   There is a petition you can uh sign
[01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:50.720]   Uh, go, you know read the eff or epic or buchniers blog
[01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:53.440]   this essentially uh kills
[01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:59.600]   Free speech online and they're trying to kind of shepherd it through
[01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:09.040]   Um, while we're not paying attention. That's because if they introduced a bill that said explicitly you got to have a backdoor in your encryption
[01:06:09.040 --> 01:06:12.160]   They know we would all sit up take notice and say no
[01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:16.960]   So they're not doing that they're doing something yeah, the problem too. You take here
[01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:24.480]   And and I was in the senate with with the working group on regulation that i'm a part of and an aid and senator widenzall
[01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:28.000]   office who was co-author of section 230
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:35.360]   Was very unhappy with the platform is because they weren't sending high level people to to testify against fast access to
[01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:40.160]   Because who wants to stand there and seems if they're in people's terrible right? Yeah, it looks bad
[01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:43.040]   Oh, i'm all force extraficking. Yeah
[01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:48.320]   Now they know what they're doing they've done this before and now they've got this is this has been weapon slice by slice
[01:06:48.320 --> 01:06:50.720]   Yeah, our freedom is going to go slice by slice. Um
[01:06:51.520 --> 01:06:55.760]   So you can go to uh, you know the fight for the future, which has done a great job
[01:06:55.760 --> 01:06:59.920]   Uh fighting for the future of the internet all along they they helped
[01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:07.680]   In the boycott against sus defesta, which didn't work, but they also uh, they did actually some really successful boycotts in the past
[01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:12.560]   Action network.org the petition is online there the more people assign it the better
[01:07:12.560 --> 01:07:15.280]   We'll demonstrate that even though we are all
[01:07:15.280 --> 01:07:18.960]   sheltering in place or you know suffering from
[01:07:19.840 --> 01:07:23.760]   The uh impact of the virus we still care we still care
[01:07:23.760 --> 01:07:28.720]   This is bad news. Let me take a break we
[01:07:28.720 --> 01:07:31.360]   Get find some good news
[01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:35.520]   Find some good news. There's got to be some happy stories
[01:07:35.520 --> 01:07:41.760]   What about that bug? Is that a good story or a bad story jeff the bug? No, it's a jeff's gonna have a rant story
[01:07:41.760 --> 01:07:45.200]   Well, we like rants rants are good
[01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:49.280]   It's going to be a good story that it was into a rant prepare yourself
[01:07:49.280 --> 01:07:53.840]   Meanwhile, let me tell you about our sponsor health. Thank you. This is a good story
[01:07:53.840 --> 01:07:59.520]   I think a lot of people who uh watch our shows listen to our shows are very health conscious
[01:07:59.520 --> 01:08:04.960]   They try to eat right they try to get at eight hours of sleep and I mean this is you right you exercise five days
[01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:07.600]   You play pickleball five days a week
[01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:12.400]   You deserve a better deal in life insurance because you're healthier
[01:08:13.120 --> 01:08:15.120]   But a lot of times you're just a number
[01:08:15.120 --> 01:08:22.320]   You're just a number to a life insurance company. That's where health IQ comes in there a life insurance agency that goes to bat for you
[01:08:22.320 --> 01:08:28.320]   They use science and data to secure lower life insurance rates for healthy people like you
[01:08:28.320 --> 01:08:32.640]   And I mean it like as an example a million dollar life insurance policy
[01:08:32.640 --> 01:08:35.200]   from $36 a month
[01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:40.560]   See people were healthy have always subsidized people were less health conscious. It's not a conspiracy
[01:08:40.640 --> 01:08:41.760]   it's
[01:08:41.760 --> 01:08:43.760]   actuarial science is just numbers
[01:08:43.760 --> 01:08:45.440]   but
[01:08:45.440 --> 01:08:51.840]   There's you know life insurance agents our agencies are not you know incented to try to give you the best price
[01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:53.920]   You need to go to health IQ
[01:08:53.920 --> 01:08:57.120]   If you're a runner a cyclist if you're into crossfit or pickleball
[01:08:57.120 --> 01:09:00.720]   Maybe you're a vegetarian or a vegan you deserve to be rewarded
[01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:03.280]   For your hard work with better rates
[01:09:03.280 --> 01:09:10.240]   Because physically active people have significantly lower risks for heart disease cancer and diabetes health IQ is a
[01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:14.720]   concierge a white glove service that walk you through the entire process of applying

[01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:25.680]   Jeff Jarvis in uh, New Jersey
[01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:28.640]   Hobo can put up a curfew right
[01:10:28.640 --> 01:10:30.800]   Wow
[01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:33.840]   And you don't have that where you are you can go out and feed the deer anytime
[01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:36.640]   Yeah, they're they're they're old and left
[01:10:36.640 --> 01:10:44.720]   There we go people think of New Jersey as you know the place across the river from Manhattan
[01:10:44.720 --> 01:10:49.440]   You know where all the food flavoring plants are we put grass over the chemicals
[01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:53.920]   Very nice people think of New Jersey it flows at night
[01:10:53.920 --> 01:10:59.040]   It's very nice as that's as the opening of the sopranos where tony sopranos driving across the bridge
[01:10:59.040 --> 01:11:02.320]   There's beautiful parts of New Jersey. It's a beautiful state
[01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:08.720]   It is. It's the garden state. I believe it is indeed some parts are
[01:11:08.720 --> 01:11:14.240]   What is baby yoda doing? He's holding New Jersey and his little baby
[01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:17.520]   Oh, is that the New Jersey Twitter account?
[01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:19.920]   Yes
[01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:24.960]   Yes, it is. I think they posted that. Oh my god. That's really forgot. Yes. Yeah, they're so great
[01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:27.520]   NJ gov
[01:11:27.520 --> 01:11:30.560]   They got some wild person doing their social media
[01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:33.200]   Two of them two of them. Oh, you know them?
[01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:39.840]   Well, no, no, there was a New Yorker profile. Oh god, of course. That's brilliant. That's brilliant
[01:11:39.840 --> 01:11:43.680]   Uh, they're writing a lot about the virus these days
[01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:46.960]   Um
[01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:51.920]   Your bug story games your bug story. So last night i'm sitting here happily i'm well not happily
[01:11:51.920 --> 01:11:56.560]   I'm reading my twitter list and going, you know psychotic and crazy and i just make some
[01:11:56.560 --> 01:12:01.920]   A suggestion stop reading twitter stop reading news stop watching news get an old movie
[01:12:01.920 --> 01:12:08.720]   And watching old movies like they're blissfully ignorant of all of this. They're just having fun
[01:12:08.720 --> 01:12:12.080]   I've been watching old movies every night. I feel much better
[01:12:12.080 --> 01:12:15.440]   You're blind
[01:12:15.440 --> 01:12:18.480]   Yeah, I got my head to sand
[01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:22.560]   Let me tell you what's going on. Yeah, I don't care if it's jaws. I don't care if it's a scary movie
[01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:29.120]   Kevin's a big shark. Well done kevin. He loves sharks. I don't care if it's jaws. It's seriously it will take your mind off it
[01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:35.600]   Money life that would be better. I'm saying i'm sitting there and i'm seeing people my sister the reverend Jarvis
[01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:41.040]   Kid me and said I had just had a post taken down by facebook because it was it was against community standards
[01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:44.400]   My sister's a minister. She doesn't do she she is community standards, right?
[01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:46.080]   um
[01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:48.000]   And i'd seen like
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:51.360]   Ten of these go by and they were all odd. So I said that was most people kind of bug
[01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:56.320]   And as it started growing up I went on on facebook on facebook and I said facebook
[01:12:56.320 --> 01:13:00.160]   You got something kind of problem going on lots of people were getting some crazy things taken down
[01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:04.560]   And within 15 minutes fiji simo who's in charge of the facebook app
[01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:07.280]   Came on and said um
[01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:09.680]   Uh, can you give us some examples?
[01:13:09.680 --> 01:13:14.800]   So wow you have you have some poll my friend. Uh, well, she's happened to be there, right?
[01:13:15.120 --> 01:13:19.120]   She's also sitting somewhere at home with nothing to do. So, um
[01:13:19.120 --> 01:13:23.840]   Uh, I got some examples together. I saw people on twitter too and I said the same thing on twitter
[01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:29.840]   Let me know when I put those things on and she came back at first the presumption was that
[01:13:29.840 --> 01:13:32.320]   Facebook told its
[01:13:32.320 --> 01:13:37.200]   Um monitors to go work off site and that that was the problem
[01:13:37.200 --> 01:13:40.800]   And she kind of thought that was she speculated that might be it she came back very quickly
[01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:43.360]   It's a no no. I was nothing to do with that the spam
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:45.200]   Um
[01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:48.720]   Algorithm has gone haywire and it's taken down all kinds of stuff shouldn't take down
[01:13:48.720 --> 01:13:52.400]   And we'll get it all back up and I said well, it's the same thing to do with coronavirus
[01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:55.600]   She said no it looks like it's something to do with coronavirus because I had a lot of coronavirus spam
[01:13:55.600 --> 01:14:00.160]   But no, it's just the algorithm went when I was taking that too much stuff that was that
[01:14:00.160 --> 01:14:06.000]   So fine and then people started most people said oh thanks. Okay, good to know and stuff starts going up, right?
[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:06.880]   So it's fine
[01:14:06.880 --> 01:14:10.640]   But then there's always those people we had knocked on the bunker door
[01:14:11.520 --> 01:14:13.920]   And they stick their head out and they've got a theory
[01:14:13.920 --> 01:14:17.920]   And this is what's driving me crazy. So people it was a bug
[01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:22.960]   I didn't use the word bug. Dave why don't you use the word bug? It's a bug. It was a bug
[01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:25.440]   And they fixed it and stuff's going back. Everybody's saying yeah, it's going back up
[01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:33.840]   Well, oh my god. This is this is clearly a conspiracy on facebook's part because uh two of my stories were critical of trump
[01:14:33.840 --> 01:14:36.160]   And so I know what they're doing and none. No, no, no
[01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:39.200]   And I said it's a bug
[01:14:39.200 --> 01:14:44.160]   There's plenty of other things to get upset about but people were still going on and on and I said to them at some point
[01:14:44.160 --> 01:14:50.480]   This is like when your car breaks down. You're trying to cycle analyze it and find a conspiracy theory
[01:14:50.480 --> 01:14:56.560]   Why does my car hates you it hates you and it had a very bad childhood. Yeah, it's a bug
[01:14:56.560 --> 01:15:02.000]   This is the only bad thing about staying home a lot. You have a lot more free time to come with crap
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:08.640]   So so yeah, and even this today there because they keep going on. No, no, no, you're wrong. This is a conspiracy. They're doing this nice
[01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:11.360]   Isn't there enough to worry about right now?
[01:15:11.360 --> 01:15:15.680]   But no, so facebook has restored all those posts
[01:15:15.680 --> 01:15:22.480]   As far as I know they have but they were but it was taking a long time. It was it was into this more well into mid-morning people were saying oh it just came back
[01:15:22.480 --> 01:15:28.480]   So yes, this and then the restore is around. Oh my god facebook's taking down things around coronavirus
[01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:35.840]   No, they're taking down what the algorithm thinks is spam and a lot of that happens to be things because basically everything everyone's talking about
[01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:40.320]   The entire world right now is the coronavirus right so the odds are gonna take that coronavirus stuff
[01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:47.200]   They're very good if they're taking down the wrong stuff. It's flaise law never put down a conspiracy where you can put down a
[01:15:47.200 --> 01:15:50.000]   incompetence. Yes. Yes
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:57.520]   So it was it was and so I I you know and I I just I don't work for facebook. I have no relationship with facebook
[01:15:57.520 --> 01:16:03.440]   I'm just just trying to help people. I'm just trying to say their stuff was taken down something went wrong
[01:16:03.920 --> 01:16:08.800]   Put it back. Can you and they did and that should have been that but no no never never
[01:16:08.800 --> 01:16:15.040]   This is the cover from this week's new yorker, which actually is pretty good. It's called critical mass
[01:16:15.040 --> 01:16:17.840]   by christoph niehman
[01:16:17.840 --> 01:16:22.880]   And uh, it looks at first from a distance like a coronavirus with a guy stuck in the middle, but actually it's a
[01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:26.080]   He's sheltering in place surrounded by dominoes
[01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:28.640]   One touch and they shall fall
[01:16:28.640 --> 01:16:31.680]   I bet you that's how a lot of people especially in Manhattan
[01:16:32.240 --> 01:16:34.240]   feel right now just
[01:16:34.240 --> 01:16:36.560]   Yeah, I mean can you imagine like
[01:16:36.560 --> 01:16:42.080]   I can't imagine the weather's nice here. Thank goodness because I can't imagine being stuck in a
[01:16:42.080 --> 01:16:46.880]   This is enough space for three people, but if I were in Manhattan in an apartment. Oh, yes
[01:16:46.880 --> 01:16:47.840]   Yes
[01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:53.280]   Or I saw some journalist post something like when you're a journalist in your roommate isn't right now
[01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:59.680]   And they're both working from home and the person working from home that isn't the journalist is like chillin and the journalist is like all out crazy
[01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:05.360]   Which I totally i'm like, yeah, that that would be me if I read a regional daily or yeah
[01:17:05.360 --> 01:17:07.920]   Yeah, that's actually pretty funny
[01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:13.200]   We also as our faculty we we had some debate about this, but i'm glad we made the right decision
[01:17:13.200 --> 01:17:16.400]   We told our students they are not allowed to go out and report
[01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:18.320]   Good
[01:17:18.320 --> 01:17:21.360]   Good. Uh, which is that i think i'm i think by all means the right decision
[01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:24.800]   But it's hard for them and so they're in their apartments. They're trying to figure out how to do stories
[01:17:24.800 --> 01:17:26.800]   They're trying to figure out how to get material for those stories
[01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:33.120]   And then the other thing that's happening is okay. I'm in New York still, but my roommate just left and left me with a red check
[01:17:33.120 --> 01:17:41.280]   I was just all kinds of yeah, this is tough. I run journalism student or writer. I told my kid this
[01:17:41.280 --> 01:17:44.320]   Uh, he's 17. I said you're living through history
[01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:51.200]   You know how you talk to your elders and they say you know the depression or world war one or world war two
[01:17:51.200 --> 01:17:53.600]   You're living through history. Keep a journal
[01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:58.480]   This is a great time to take those writing skills and instead of going out and looking for a story
[01:17:58.480 --> 01:18:03.280]   Start just writing about it writing what you're experiencing writing what it's about that
[01:18:03.280 --> 01:18:06.800]   What do you use facebook to put together communities of people or do that?
[01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:11.440]   I mean there's lots of things you can do but all kinds of things you can do right now that the act is public service
[01:18:11.440 --> 01:18:19.440]   Journal from the plague year will you know that could be your bestseller? I'm just saying and right now like the thing about people like my daughter
[01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:24.080]   This is their 9/11 their challenge or their generational
[01:18:24.480 --> 01:18:27.920]   That's exactly right. That's exactly right. Yep
[01:18:27.920 --> 01:18:30.800]   And man, how's your daughter doing?
[01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:33.920]   She is she is fine. Um, I she
[01:18:33.920 --> 01:18:38.320]   Her friends call this the boomer remover the senior deleader
[01:18:38.320 --> 01:18:41.760]   Thank you very much
[01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:48.320]   They are they are definitely hard. Oh, you got it Stacy
[01:18:49.920 --> 01:18:55.600]   Oh, yeah, I did and they think it's good funny. Haha. They it's the callousness of youth
[01:18:55.600 --> 01:18:59.760]   I don't think they don't want their grandparents to die, but you know how kids are they they're
[01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:02.080]   What's the way they call the boomer de leader?
[01:19:02.080 --> 01:19:05.920]   The boomer remover boomer remover. All right. We have a show title
[01:19:05.920 --> 01:19:12.080]   It's not just her friends. It's it's like you use you all over the place
[01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:16.720]   Uh senior deleader. I believe this one and
[01:19:17.760 --> 01:19:22.000]   And there's another one, but I can't remember what it was. Oh, man. Oh, find out. They're not nice
[01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:27.280]   No, that's normal. It's fine. So how many hours is she online with the school?
[01:19:27.280 --> 01:19:32.480]   So her school is actually surprisingly competent. So yay, her school
[01:19:32.480 --> 01:19:37.600]   Um, they when we had snow days had to use zoom for parent teacher conferences
[01:19:37.600 --> 01:19:41.680]   And so they activated their zoom. They've already been on google class. So
[01:19:41.680 --> 01:19:47.200]   Starting tomorrow. She will have her first remote day. They're going to do
[01:19:47.760 --> 01:19:49.760]   Their Wednesday is going to be a free
[01:19:49.760 --> 01:19:55.440]   Like do the assigned workday basically, but they have to log on within 10 minutes on zoom
[01:19:55.440 --> 01:19:59.600]   Within 10 minutes of their period their class periods start time. They log on
[01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:02.080]   They've got to have headphones. They
[01:20:02.080 --> 01:20:05.120]   Have they have the explanation for the mute button
[01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:08.640]   Don't raising your hand and they're going to conduct
[01:20:08.640 --> 01:20:15.280]   Class good and so I actually may do twig in a like the next oh no Wednesday is not a that's the day
[01:20:15.280 --> 01:20:19.440]   She's out of class. Never mind. I was going to say you may see me in a different place because she's going to have my office
[01:20:19.440 --> 01:20:23.520]   Oh, that's so great. Aren't you glad you have this great streaming setup? You're ready to go
[01:20:23.520 --> 01:20:27.440]   Oh, she's not going to use. I'm going to move like the mic
[01:20:27.440 --> 01:20:31.920]   But oh she could be very very impressive with the light. Yeah, no kidding
[01:20:31.920 --> 01:20:35.040]   I'm doing this with with with the school conferences
[01:20:35.040 --> 01:20:42.160]   After the I guess the election results on the Tuesday, I guess that was last night
[01:20:42.400 --> 01:20:46.160]   I'm watching msnbc and they have you know how they have eight people or whatever in a panel
[01:20:46.160 --> 01:20:51.760]   And they have all these people and they introduced the last guy at podcaster and he's got the microphone
[01:20:51.760 --> 01:20:57.040]   Oh, yeah, he's a podcaster. This is our this is our universal look now
[01:20:57.040 --> 01:21:01.520]   I take credit for having invented
[01:21:01.520 --> 01:21:09.280]   No, I'm I'm really impressed because they're they're definitely good. Yeah trying to figure out how to proctor tests
[01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:11.360]   That's one of their challenging things. Yes
[01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:16.720]   Their word the kids can cheat which they can well there's an honor code you're supposed to solve
[01:21:16.720 --> 01:21:24.880]   Yeah, you're like your parents are supposed to proctor the test for them. I mean, I would get my kid in a Stanford. Yeah, yeah, no kidding
[01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:30.240]   So how about michael, you know, well the funny thing about michael. He's been an online school for years
[01:21:30.240 --> 01:21:33.360]   So right he's gone to high school
[01:21:33.360 --> 01:21:36.480]   And honestly, I think that's another side effect of this
[01:21:36.480 --> 01:21:40.960]   Uh, there's already been because of the charter school movement, especially in california
[01:21:41.440 --> 01:21:48.000]   Um, california in california, you can create a school and get the state's money per pupil
[01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:53.840]   If you follow certain rules, it's called a charter school. So piercein, which is a big as you know, it's my was my publisher
[01:21:53.840 --> 01:21:59.760]   Big education company. They've set up. They call it the connection academy. It's an online school
[01:21:59.760 --> 01:22:06.320]   And it is free because it's a public school. They get paid per student just like any other school. It's a charter school
[01:22:06.320 --> 01:22:10.480]   Uh, they have teachers online sometimes live sometimes on demand
[01:22:11.120 --> 01:22:17.280]   They have you get sent a box with textbooks and you got to have your ti calculator all that stuff
[01:22:17.280 --> 01:22:21.440]   Um, it's it so for him. This isn't business as usual
[01:22:21.440 --> 01:22:24.320]   This is completely normal
[01:22:24.320 --> 01:22:27.600]   I mean the difference is that in order we have to give him a social life
[01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:31.520]   So, you know, we have boys night on friday night stuff. We have his those teenage boys i was talking about
[01:22:31.520 --> 01:22:35.040]   Over and that's missing and that's hurting him. He doesn't like that
[01:22:35.040 --> 01:22:39.680]   So what tips would he have for the students who are now subtly finding themselves doing this?
[01:22:39.760 --> 01:22:42.320]   I you know the thing that impresses the hell out of me
[01:22:42.320 --> 01:22:45.360]   Is his work ethic. He's a straight a student
[01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:51.200]   Uh, we initially did this because he he had trouble in classrooms. There were two noisy. He couldn't focus
[01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:57.760]   Um, so one-on-one teaching worked out very well for him and he's been doing that for a long time like since fifth grade
[01:22:57.760 --> 01:23:00.800]   but in all through high school and
[01:23:00.800 --> 01:23:03.600]   I don't know if it I think it's him
[01:23:03.600 --> 01:23:08.480]   Or maybe it's because he's been doing this but his discipline is amazing. So he'll do he has he gets up
[01:23:08.560 --> 01:23:10.560]   It's class starts at 8 a.m
[01:23:10.560 --> 01:23:14.880]   He gets up has breakfast at 8 a.m. It's you know, he doesn't at least he doesn't have to drive school
[01:23:14.880 --> 01:23:20.960]   He just goes to the office, but he you know, he starts class when he gets out at noon. He makes himself lunch
[01:23:20.960 --> 01:23:28.720]   He goes he goes into the gym goes on the treadmill for, you know, half an hour get some exercise
[01:23:28.720 --> 01:23:32.720]   Uh, he gets now after that he gets to game a little bit and then he goes
[01:23:32.720 --> 01:23:37.360]   And then he does homework and he'll go into the office at night after dinner and do homework
[01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:40.400]   So that's the real challenge is the discipline
[01:23:40.400 --> 01:23:43.600]   Yeah, because you're not you know, you're not regimented
[01:23:43.600 --> 01:23:48.080]   You don't have the structure that you would have if you had to go to school and be in school and it's time for lunch
[01:23:48.080 --> 01:23:50.880]   You go to the cafeteria and all that stuff. It's homework hour or whatever
[01:23:50.880 --> 01:23:55.680]   But he has that discipline which is remarkable and I would bet that's the hardest thing
[01:23:55.680 --> 01:24:00.480]   Yeah, and surprisingly as a remote worker, I've worked remotely since 2008
[01:24:00.480 --> 01:24:04.480]   Five I can't remember a long time
[01:24:04.960 --> 01:24:10.960]   2005 wow, it's that discipline you have to yeah, which I don't have right now at all
[01:24:10.960 --> 01:24:14.080]   What helped? I'm so distracted. Oh
[01:24:14.080 --> 01:24:18.880]   As a reporter what was helpful is I always I was on a constant deadline
[01:24:18.880 --> 01:24:24.720]   So, you know, you're constantly you can't like slack off for an hour and chill right because you're
[01:24:24.720 --> 01:24:27.520]   You're constantly producing news
[01:24:27.520 --> 01:24:32.240]   So I think it's harder to be disciplined when you're not on the hook or
[01:24:33.200 --> 01:24:39.280]   You know the flip side is I worked way too much and I burnt myself out right you know, that's the other side, isn't it?
[01:24:39.280 --> 01:24:42.720]   You can it can actually go the other direction where you work too hard
[01:24:42.720 --> 01:24:45.920]   Well, yeah, because if you're a reporter, there's always I mean, right?
[01:24:45.920 --> 01:24:48.480]   Any job if you're working at home
[01:24:48.480 --> 01:24:53.680]   There's there's no governor in any direction. You can you know, you can either work too little or you can work too hard
[01:24:53.680 --> 01:24:57.680]   It's hard to work a normal amount when you're in it's hard to it's hard to work like
[01:24:58.240 --> 01:25:04.640]   As a manager for a time. I was an editor working, you know and overseeing people and it was hard as a manager to like
[01:25:04.640 --> 01:25:08.800]   You had to really touch base with people and communicate very clearly with them
[01:25:08.800 --> 01:25:12.320]   This is enough. This isn't enough. I think you're working too hard
[01:25:12.320 --> 01:25:19.840]   And that is really a skill that many managers don't have in journalism. It's a skill that like journalists are terrible managers
[01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:22.640]   I was
[01:25:22.640 --> 01:25:28.080]   Not not for not for the same reason as all the other terrible managers, but it's not it's not a general
[01:25:28.080 --> 01:25:32.880]   I said say most people and I'm include myself are terrible managers. That is a
[01:25:32.880 --> 01:25:36.960]   Managing people is a skill set that is not yes common
[01:25:36.960 --> 01:25:39.840]   A good manager is hard to find
[01:25:39.840 --> 01:25:45.040]   Honestly, that's a when I see people who are good managers. I'm always impressed
[01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:52.480]   I don't think that's a common skill at all. Oh my goodness. Y'all Hawaii just said oh, no, that was Tuesday
[01:25:52.480 --> 01:25:56.720]   Okay, good said please don't come to our island. Yeah, they closed a while
[01:25:57.200 --> 01:25:59.200]   Yeah for 30 days. Yeah
[01:25:59.200 --> 01:26:02.160]   Yeah, and port Puerto Rico was trying to do the same thing
[01:26:02.160 --> 01:26:07.120]   We're doing okay and people coming in my son is in bally
[01:26:07.120 --> 01:26:10.640]   I said in the island. He said yeah, I said stay there
[01:26:10.640 --> 01:26:13.600]   Jesus
[01:26:13.600 --> 01:26:18.400]   He's not gonna be able to come home. I don't think he was in Vietnam and he said they're getting very hostile tourists here
[01:26:18.400 --> 01:26:24.320]   I can't go into shops or restaurants. So he left went to bally where apparently the party never stops
[01:26:25.440 --> 01:26:28.320]   uh, the other it is there's the island right in the middle there and
[01:26:28.320 --> 01:26:32.000]   But he says I'm gonna get really good at surfing
[01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:35.440]   But on the other hand, nobody's doing any distancing or anything
[01:26:35.440 --> 01:26:39.920]   That's you know, and there is there are cases there. Of course. There's nowhere
[01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:43.600]   No, we're safe. Let's do get those trumpets ready Kevin because I think
[01:26:43.600 --> 01:26:47.520]   This would be a good time to do the google changelog
[01:26:47.520 --> 01:26:50.560]   the google changelog
[01:26:51.200 --> 01:26:56.080]   Here's what's new from the goog and despite the fact that they're all working at home. They actually
[01:26:56.080 --> 01:26:58.880]   There's quite a bit going on
[01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:04.320]   Uh, if you are using google advanced protection as I am, uh, they are strengthening
[01:27:04.320 --> 01:27:11.680]   The protection they're making google's play protect scanning, which is there any malware scan on android a mandatory
[01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:16.880]   Uh switch and you can no longer sideload on android if you have advanced protection
[01:27:17.360 --> 01:27:22.720]   You can't uncheck that box. It says only download from the google play store that box is permanent
[01:27:22.720 --> 01:27:26.400]   Uh, I don't think that's a bad thing. They set up advanced protection
[01:27:26.400 --> 01:27:35.680]   Uh after the hack of the dnc four years ago saying there's some people like you know the uh head of the dnc who need to be
[01:27:35.680 --> 01:27:38.160]   extra protected
[01:27:38.160 --> 01:27:40.160]   And uh, so it involves the use of uh
[01:27:40.160 --> 01:27:46.320]   Security keys physical security keys and there's a lot of things you can't do and now they've added two more things
[01:27:47.120 --> 01:27:50.400]   Google lens is going to be at work on new york times
[01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:56.800]   magazines annual music issue is that is that coming up this week? I guess it is this sunday
[01:27:56.800 --> 01:28:00.720]   You'll be able to so 2002. I know I know
[01:28:00.720 --> 01:28:06.400]   Only just all you have to do is wear a headset and the music will come to life
[01:28:06.400 --> 01:28:14.160]   Oh, jesus. Isn't that funny? Yeah, so you who's going to do this point their phone at a picture in the magazine
[01:28:14.400 --> 01:28:20.640]   There was a Dutch company that did this for publications. I mean about 15 years ago. Yeah, I met them
[01:28:20.640 --> 01:28:22.240]   Um
[01:28:22.240 --> 01:28:26.320]   They it was super cool and they put them in advertisements and magazines. I remember them
[01:28:26.320 --> 01:28:28.640]   I met with them in south by south west to your side, right?
[01:28:28.640 --> 01:28:29.920]   Right
[01:28:29.920 --> 01:28:31.920]   But it was so cumbersome
[01:28:31.920 --> 01:28:37.360]   Yeah, which is like I mean when i'm reading a magazine i'm reading a dang magazine. I'm not
[01:28:37.360 --> 01:28:44.240]   Stacey are you all enough to remember the to know the qcat? Oh my god the cute
[01:28:44.240 --> 01:28:48.400]   Chat yes, I am I have one somewhere in my music just barely
[01:28:48.400 --> 01:28:54.160]   This the idea was you'd go to radio shack and you get this free barcode scanner
[01:28:54.160 --> 01:28:59.600]   And you plug it into the usp port in your computer and as you're reading a magazine. Oh not usp. Oh, no, no, no
[01:28:59.600 --> 01:29:05.760]   Usp did serial it was a serial for serial. Oh, I was it was it was your audio ports or something weird. Yeah. Yeah
[01:29:05.760 --> 01:29:07.760]   I know the guy who invented it
[01:29:07.760 --> 01:29:13.200]   And uh, yeah, it was something weird wasn't it and you'd be reading a magazine. Oh look there's a link in the magazine
[01:29:13.440 --> 01:29:17.440]   Which nowadays I think most people would just type it in but no you scan it
[01:29:17.440 --> 01:29:22.800]   Your computer browser launches and there you are on the page because no one's gonna want to type in these
[01:29:22.800 --> 01:29:25.120]   rules
[01:29:25.120 --> 01:29:29.760]   It's like a qr code a qr code basically it is a qr code basically which also has it works either
[01:29:29.760 --> 01:29:33.280]   But fine. Yes, not here, but in china qr codes are like
[01:29:33.280 --> 01:29:36.720]   Don't you see him jeff? Well, I know you don't go in the subway anymore
[01:29:36.720 --> 01:29:40.000]   But I think that we're all over subway ads and stuff qr
[01:29:40.160 --> 01:29:45.200]   I have never seen a single really the subway never scanning a never oh you'd get
[01:29:45.200 --> 01:29:48.160]   Your codes I scan them all the two
[01:29:48.160 --> 01:29:50.560]   I do too
[01:29:50.560 --> 01:29:52.800]   Maybe you're just old and cranky in a new yorker
[01:29:52.800 --> 01:30:00.320]   New yorkers. You know what it's the act of scanning makes you look like you're interested in something and new yorkers could never be
[01:30:00.320 --> 01:30:03.360]   Hjf who's this month's miss nickerbocker
[01:30:07.040 --> 01:30:10.480]   Even I I guess you're not old enough for that either. All right, what?
[01:30:10.480 --> 01:30:17.600]   That's all I remember from the subway they're misused to have this subway in subway. Yeah
[01:30:17.600 --> 01:30:22.240]   Why not yeah, they used to have ads actually get ready
[01:30:22.240 --> 01:30:27.600]   There's gonna be a lot more of this ar style stuff because apple released weirdly apple announced and this is
[01:30:27.600 --> 01:30:33.840]   Kind of the change log but for apple apple announced that they're closing all their stores worldwide except for the china stores
[01:30:33.840 --> 01:30:35.840]   Which are now reopened?
[01:30:35.840 --> 01:30:42.640]   So you can't go into an apple store for the duration they now say by the way instead of like may 15th
[01:30:42.640 --> 01:30:48.960]   They say until further notice, which is to me not a good sign. That's not great. Good sign
[01:30:48.960 --> 01:30:54.560]   They announced new ipads today a new macbook air today and I'm very upset about this
[01:30:54.560 --> 01:30:56.960]   Why they're saying it has a light are
[01:30:56.960 --> 01:31:03.440]   That's okay. Okay. So that's my point. So the new ipad pros will now have better cameras and
[01:31:04.240 --> 01:31:09.200]   A depth of field sensor is not light are they're calling time of time of they're calling a light are
[01:31:09.200 --> 01:31:14.080]   That is apple's marketing unless they have done some amazing apple magic, which maybe they have
[01:31:14.080 --> 01:31:19.760]   This is not light are light are is much higher resolution. It's incredibly expensive
[01:31:19.760 --> 01:31:22.640]   You could not put it on a machine this big or this sorry
[01:31:22.640 --> 01:31:25.440]   it would drain the batteries and
[01:31:25.440 --> 01:31:27.920]   it
[01:31:27.920 --> 01:31:30.720]   This is a time of flight. This has to be time of flight
[01:31:31.600 --> 01:31:38.640]   And I wish that someone would actually ask apple about this because the apple marketing machine is just going into overdrive and I think
[01:31:38.640 --> 01:31:42.400]   They're wrong wouldn't be the first time. Not actual lighter. They say
[01:31:42.400 --> 01:31:50.400]   I'm going to quote light are light detection and rating is ranging is used to determine distance by measuring how long it takes light
[01:31:50.400 --> 01:31:54.400]   To reach an object and reflect back. Yeah, that's time of flight
[01:31:54.400 --> 01:31:59.360]   It's so advanced. It's being used by nasa for the next mars landing mission
[01:31:59.920 --> 01:32:01.920]   And now it's been engineered to fit in the
[01:32:01.920 --> 01:32:08.800]   Now it's been the engineer and velcro and space pens
[01:32:08.800 --> 01:32:14.000]   It's now been engineered to fit in the thin and light iPad pro the custom designed
[01:32:14.000 --> 01:32:18.240]   Light are they're using lid are all they don't see a trademark next to it
[01:32:18.240 --> 01:32:24.080]   Scanner uses direct time of flight to measure reflected light from up to five meters away both indoors and out
[01:32:24.080 --> 01:32:27.680]   It works. Oh get ready for this at the photon level
[01:32:28.160 --> 01:32:34.640]   operates at nanosecond speeds and opens up tremendous possibilities for augmented reality
[01:32:34.640 --> 01:32:37.120]   And be warranty whoever wrote this
[01:32:37.120 --> 01:32:40.800]   So a time of flight is not necessarily lidar
[01:32:40.800 --> 01:32:49.120]   Um lidar they use the same basic science, which is like i'm sending out light lidar sends out a laser and I believe in
[01:32:49.120 --> 01:32:54.320]   I it's I'd have to go back to my notes and I doubt this is a laser right. This is just a light
[01:32:54.960 --> 01:32:58.800]   Yeah, so if you want to and those are you know light is photons y'all
[01:32:58.800 --> 01:33:01.280]   um
[01:33:01.280 --> 01:33:06.160]   So it sends out light and it usually it is omnidirectional
[01:33:06.160 --> 01:33:10.880]   Um, the ones on cars are omnidirectional those are the big hunky things you see on top of a car
[01:33:10.880 --> 01:33:13.680]   They're higher. They're higher. They're 3d image. Yeah
[01:33:13.680 --> 01:33:19.120]   They're higher resolution. They need a source of power. They're not they're not efficient
[01:33:19.120 --> 01:33:20.800]   um
[01:33:20.800 --> 01:33:23.200]   And their frame rates are usually
[01:33:23.760 --> 01:33:25.760]   slower because
[01:33:25.760 --> 01:33:30.560]   Again takes a lot of computing power to resolve the image and do all that math. Um
[01:33:30.560 --> 01:33:32.880]   so
[01:33:32.880 --> 01:33:34.880]   In time of flight sensors
[01:33:34.880 --> 01:33:40.480]   Work a similar way you flash the light so you do pulses of light you flash the light the light comes back and you
[01:33:40.480 --> 01:33:42.560]   Take the reading and you do the math that says
[01:33:42.560 --> 01:33:45.200]   This flash of light was this far away
[01:33:45.200 --> 01:33:50.800]   This flash of light was that far away and then you create an image of what the light is bouncing off of
[01:33:51.280 --> 01:33:54.240]   Kind of like sonar or something. Yeah, it's like sonar for light
[01:33:54.240 --> 01:33:58.640]   It's actually not but we're not going to get into all of that because
[01:33:58.640 --> 01:34:01.920]   I I mean
[01:34:01.920 --> 01:34:03.920]   Light I made that same
[01:34:03.920 --> 01:34:09.120]   conclusion and I had this is how it works Stacy. I know because it's on the apple website
[01:34:09.120 --> 01:34:11.120]   ooh
[01:34:11.120 --> 01:34:12.800]   zoom in and
[01:34:12.800 --> 01:34:14.800]   Liar
[01:34:14.800 --> 01:34:17.040]   Wow
[01:34:17.040 --> 01:34:20.000]   That's cool. Can you do that at home?
[01:34:20.960 --> 01:34:23.440]   Okay, I wonder if it works backwards. Oh, it does look
[01:34:23.440 --> 01:34:30.400]   All right, so what would you call it? I mean isn't that what was in what was that?
[01:34:30.400 --> 01:34:33.360]   I'm a flight sensor. It's in it's in the freaking
[01:34:33.360 --> 01:34:40.080]   The lighthouse remember that lighthouse thing we had this security thing. It was also in the lighthouse. Yes. Yeah, so it's a time of flight sensor
[01:34:40.080 --> 01:34:42.560]   but
[01:34:42.560 --> 01:34:44.560]   Now I will say
[01:34:44.720 --> 01:34:51.680]   It is possible because apple has a lot of very smart geniuses locked away in their spaceship. I call them wizards
[01:34:51.680 --> 01:34:54.400]   Wizards whichever
[01:34:54.400 --> 01:34:59.760]   They may have figured out a way to cram light r into a cost-effective battery efficient
[01:34:59.760 --> 01:35:07.200]   Power like package and put it on a computer that only costs how much does this cost again? $1000. Yeah, that's not lighter
[01:35:07.200 --> 01:35:11.600]   And if they do say it's
[01:35:11.600 --> 01:35:13.600]   innovationly
[01:35:13.600 --> 01:35:18.560]   Let me see what the if I go to the tech specs. I wonder if they're a little more
[01:35:18.560 --> 01:35:21.680]   Kevin and I looked at this this morning he and I spent a lot of time
[01:35:21.680 --> 01:35:28.160]   Uh Xbox used time of flight as well. Yes, and that's the company by the way apple bought
[01:35:28.160 --> 01:35:31.520]   The israeli company that created the xbox
[01:35:31.520 --> 01:35:33.040]   I'm sense
[01:35:33.040 --> 01:35:35.120]   Yeah, prime sense
[01:35:35.120 --> 01:35:38.800]   And they're an israeli company and uh that they're the ones who created the connect
[01:35:39.680 --> 01:35:46.400]   Time of whatever flight sensor for uh, microsoft and in fact that was kind of part of the problem of the connect is the company that made it
[01:35:46.400 --> 01:35:49.360]   And up going to work for apple
[01:35:49.360 --> 01:35:52.400]   So that's you're right. It's probably the same thing as in the connect
[01:35:52.400 --> 01:35:57.040]   Well, I imagine it's a much newer version. Yes
[01:35:57.040 --> 01:36:00.800]   I'm just looking at the specs. Well, good news
[01:36:00.800 --> 01:36:03.520]   You're going to see many more of these new york times
[01:36:03.520 --> 01:36:06.320]   musical dancing flowers
[01:36:06.960 --> 01:36:11.040]   In your ipad because I think there'll be a lot more augmented reality going through the ipad
[01:36:11.040 --> 01:36:14.960]   So that really isn't part of the changelog but
[01:36:14.960 --> 01:36:20.800]   I thought it was a fun conversation. Hey, we got nowhere to go. We got no we're not in a hurry
[01:36:20.800 --> 01:36:24.880]   I i'm making meatballs tonight. I don't know about you guys. Yeah
[01:36:24.880 --> 01:36:31.760]   Actually google maps is also making live view augmented reality navigation more prominent
[01:36:31.760 --> 01:36:34.000]   I like this
[01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:37.920]   I I like oh have you used it because I like the idea of what I want the idea
[01:36:37.920 --> 01:36:40.560]   Yeah, because I never know whether I especially Manhattan
[01:36:40.560 --> 01:36:46.400]   I come out the door at the townite center for an entrepreneurial journalism
[01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:49.920]   And I don't know whether I should turn left to go to broadway or right
[01:36:49.920 --> 01:36:55.120]   I hold this thing up and it says oh, yeah, I see the building across the street go go right
[01:36:55.120 --> 01:36:58.640]   Then you got a constantly and I used it last time in melon
[01:36:59.040 --> 01:37:01.280]   But I was there a long time ago before the bird disease
[01:37:01.280 --> 01:37:03.920]   Uh, and and then it told you know, you're doing this
[01:37:03.920 --> 01:37:10.400]   It's the new dumb thing you do on the street because you're having to move back and forth for to recognize the buildings again when it when it loses
[01:37:10.400 --> 01:37:13.040]   Site exactly Kevin
[01:37:13.040 --> 01:37:19.280]   Uh, and
[01:37:19.280 --> 01:37:23.120]   But when it works for the for the 10 steps it works it's spectacular
[01:37:23.120 --> 01:37:27.600]   But then it gets confused again and you're standing there in the middle of the way. That's that's not good
[01:37:28.880 --> 01:37:31.120]   So you guys never walk anywhere so you don't have to use it
[01:37:31.120 --> 01:37:34.480]   Well, but in New York is where I is exactly where I want it. I get lost. Yeah
[01:37:34.480 --> 01:37:35.440]   Yeah
[01:37:35.440 --> 01:37:40.240]   So in the new beta of google maps the live view button appears the minute you search for
[01:37:40.240 --> 01:37:47.360]   And uh application good. I really wanted to work because trying to use google maps on foot is awful. Yeah
[01:37:47.360 --> 01:37:51.840]   Uh, speaking of misleading fake news
[01:37:51.840 --> 01:37:57.280]   Google updates its discover feed to let you flag misleading articles
[01:37:57.840 --> 01:37:59.840]   That's a good thing
[01:37:59.840 --> 01:38:05.840]   I find myself often deleting sources from the google news suggestions
[01:38:05.840 --> 01:38:12.640]   For some reason they they would like to give me crappy stuff. It's such a weird thing. Yeah, it's just algorithmic
[01:38:12.640 --> 01:38:18.320]   It's the problem with algorithms. I know well, because I ever looked now I get absolutely every there's this this
[01:38:18.320 --> 01:38:25.280]   There's a huge series of things written about frequent flyer. But I am anymore. Yeah, the points guy stuff. Yeah
[01:38:25.680 --> 01:38:27.920]   Yeah points guy. So I get I get every one of those
[01:38:27.920 --> 01:38:30.400]   Well, I can't get this
[01:38:30.400 --> 01:38:32.400]   I must have searched for sourdough
[01:38:32.400 --> 01:38:37.840]   Because for some reason almost every day I got an article about sourdough bread there's news in sourdough. Yes
[01:38:37.840 --> 01:38:40.800]   Actually, there was an article in the washington post today
[01:38:40.800 --> 01:38:45.760]   I went to bread camp to take my sourdough loaves to the next level. Here's what I learned
[01:38:45.760 --> 01:38:50.160]   Did you know what the sourdough library? No, but that's a great idea
[01:38:50.160 --> 01:38:54.400]   Uh, I just started a sourdough started this morning search search for paratos
[01:38:54.960 --> 01:38:56.960]   P-u-r-a-t-o-s.com
[01:38:56.960 --> 01:39:01.200]   We're very famous Chris just down the road a piece in san francisco
[01:39:01.200 --> 01:39:07.440]   Boudin has had its starter for its sourdough loaves for 150 years since the gold miners came here
[01:39:07.440 --> 01:39:14.720]   You need to do this. Yeah, there it is. Horado. So so go to the go to the um, what do they do? They uh
[01:39:14.720 --> 01:39:21.200]   They have a library that's by the way exactly what my starter looks like. I even have that uh, maybe it's easy search for sourdough library
[01:39:21.200 --> 01:39:23.200]   I go right right to the page
[01:39:24.800 --> 01:39:28.720]   I don't know where it is here. I'm there, but I don't know it slash next generation
[01:39:28.720 --> 01:39:32.320]   So I don't understand there's a library search
[01:39:32.320 --> 01:39:37.200]   Do what I say. I'm not doing it. It's not me. It's kevin
[01:39:37.200 --> 01:39:41.200]   Search kevin search for sourdough library. It'll take you the right to that page
[01:39:41.200 --> 01:39:44.080]   Sorry
[01:39:44.080 --> 01:39:45.920]   so um
[01:39:45.920 --> 01:39:47.840]   I started a sourdough
[01:39:47.840 --> 01:39:52.160]   Parsham hates me starter in january of this year stacy
[01:39:52.160 --> 01:39:58.720]   And it is so luscious and tangy and there's the sourdough. I read it every day
[01:39:58.720 --> 01:40:05.040]   I put it, you know what I put a little rye in it at one point to really get it zinged up apparently rye flour makes a good
[01:40:05.040 --> 01:40:06.880]   kind of
[01:40:06.880 --> 01:40:08.720]   feed for your starter
[01:40:08.720 --> 01:40:11.520]   Okay, and so good. Oh, I'm so happy you made bread
[01:40:12.560 --> 01:40:16.240]   Well more often than I should I actually put it in the freezer
[01:40:16.240 --> 01:40:21.360]   I put it in the freezer last week because I said I can't normally I bake it once a week thursday's my bread baking day
[01:40:21.360 --> 01:40:26.560]   Oh, click on the guy click on the guy is this the curator of the sourdough library? This is the sourdough library
[01:40:26.560 --> 01:40:28.720]   Every one of those is a different sourdough
[01:40:28.720 --> 01:40:32.080]   That's a lot of refrigerator space to dedicate to
[01:40:32.080 --> 01:40:35.760]   Who do not have the chance to visit us for real?
[01:40:35.760 --> 01:40:39.680]   We have now turned the library into a virtual place
[01:40:40.160 --> 01:40:47.840]   So please enter take a look around there's geeks on everything about the fantastic world of sourdough
[01:40:47.840 --> 01:40:52.480]   Do you can you buy the starters that would be cool
[01:40:52.480 --> 01:41:00.480]   So the whole thing about sourdough is it's getting its it's getting its yeast Jesus Christ where's this guy
[01:41:00.480 --> 01:41:05.920]   It's getting its yeast from the air and there's different yeasts in the air
[01:41:05.920 --> 01:41:08.560]   right so
[01:41:08.560 --> 01:41:13.440]   They they actually talk about the terroir of sourdough just as they would with wine
[01:41:13.440 --> 01:41:18.240]   We're in the wine country up here. So I think we have a very nice sourdough
[01:41:18.240 --> 01:41:20.880]   You know, I should ship you some of mine. You could ship me some of yours
[01:41:20.880 --> 01:41:25.840]   Well, I I literally just started mine. We're actually using it as a science project
[01:41:25.840 --> 01:41:32.800]   Oh, it's good. I mean i'm happy to ship you some but we made two recipes one the New York times sourdough starter recipe that involves pineapple juice
[01:41:32.800 --> 01:41:34.960]   And the other is just flour and water
[01:41:34.960 --> 01:41:40.160]   Basically, it's flour and water for me and you just leave it out a little bit because it's going to get it from the air
[01:41:40.160 --> 01:41:42.640]   and it develops over time you have to feed it
[01:41:42.640 --> 01:41:47.600]   And uh, I mind the it tastes so good
[01:41:47.600 --> 01:41:53.280]   And it's unique, you know, that's why you have to have a library because it's different everybody has a different flavor
[01:41:53.280 --> 01:41:58.000]   I just really like so when you take a jar like the sourdough library has there
[01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.320]   Yeah, how much do you actually use of it each time?
[01:42:00.320 --> 01:42:02.160]   250 grams
[01:42:02.160 --> 01:42:05.920]   And the recipe I use and it replicates on a soda. How do you how do you yeah?
[01:42:05.920 --> 01:42:10.880]   Because every time you feel it gets bigger you actually end up throwing out a lot of it because you you it grows
[01:42:10.880 --> 01:42:16.160]   I actually you know what I just did Stacy. I had it in these mace
[01:42:16.160 --> 01:42:18.320]   You know these jars these mason jars with the lid
[01:42:18.320 --> 01:42:22.240]   And I actually labeled it. I even gave it a name. I called it liz
[01:42:22.240 --> 01:42:26.720]   Um because I made one called bernie and one called liz
[01:42:26.720 --> 01:42:31.520]   I should made one said called joe. I blew it. Uh, but anyway, um
[01:42:32.480 --> 01:42:37.840]   But I now I you know do you know those I love these crocs with french mustard
[01:42:37.840 --> 01:42:43.360]   In them the grain mustard muktard demo and they they used to have quark
[01:42:43.360 --> 01:42:49.280]   Caps now they make red plastic caps, but I thought that's a I had one. That's a good
[01:42:49.280 --> 01:42:52.480]   sourdough holder
[01:42:52.480 --> 01:42:57.200]   A crock of starter a crock of starter. So that's where my starter is now. It's uh, I have uh
[01:42:58.480 --> 01:43:03.360]   Anyway, I've given it to friends. It's a wonderful gift. Here's some sour fermenting dough enjoy
[01:43:03.360 --> 01:43:10.080]   I guarantee you like half of them throw it away and the other have like two day two years after they throw it away
[01:43:10.080 --> 01:43:13.440]   They're like, oh, I wish I kept that yeah, because that would have been two years old now
[01:43:13.440 --> 01:43:17.840]   And you could freeze it you don't have to uh, keep it alive and feed it. It'll freeze perfectly well
[01:43:17.840 --> 01:43:23.360]   Have you read robin sloane set it wasn't his best book, but have you read sourdough by robin sloane?
[01:43:23.360 --> 01:43:28.000]   He's he's the guy who wrote uh mr. Penumbra's 24 hour bookstore. Oh cool
[01:43:28.800 --> 01:43:32.160]   Um, yeah, and the the book on sourdough is
[01:43:32.160 --> 01:43:37.760]   It's about robots and making sourdough bread and it's it's just it's delightful
[01:43:37.760 --> 01:43:41.520]   So parado is a cecillion wine maker
[01:43:41.520 --> 01:43:47.280]   And so the bread starters a sideline, but in the one they say in the wine country
[01:43:47.280 --> 01:43:49.760]   That's where you get the best starters because of the grapes
[01:43:49.760 --> 01:43:53.920]   Just saying
[01:43:53.920 --> 01:43:57.200]   Uh boy. We really are good. We're just wandering all over the place
[01:43:57.840 --> 01:44:00.720]   Yeah, I feel like we haven't talked about anything from google. Let's
[01:44:00.720 --> 01:44:03.920]   Are we
[01:44:03.920 --> 01:44:06.400]   In the middle of google land. Yeah google
[01:44:06.400 --> 01:44:09.520]   Real time
[01:44:09.520 --> 01:44:14.080]   Games real time transcribe mode on android. I love this feature
[01:44:14.080 --> 01:44:19.120]   And now it's in translate so that means you could transcribe a language you don't know
[01:44:19.120 --> 01:44:22.800]   Um
[01:44:22.800 --> 01:44:25.840]   There you have it. I mean, I don't know we don't have to go on with it, but there it is
[01:44:26.560 --> 01:44:32.480]   We play games ads or they hinted adding a friend's list for play together. I was like that'll be perfect right now. Yeah
[01:44:32.480 --> 01:44:34.880]   Yeah
[01:44:34.880 --> 01:44:41.200]   Uh google launches its work with chrome book badge. Isn't that pretty much anything with usbc
[01:44:41.200 --> 01:44:44.880]   No, not necessarily. I mean, this is good
[01:44:44.880 --> 01:44:48.320]   So you'll know if you're buying an accessory if it'll work with your chrome book
[01:44:48.320 --> 01:44:50.400]   Yeah, it might be just a little uh
[01:44:50.400 --> 01:44:52.960]   little money maker a little sideline for them
[01:44:53.760 --> 01:44:56.400]   Oh, you were talking about this google play games hints
[01:44:56.400 --> 01:45:03.440]   Additing a friend's list for a new play together feature. You know, that was one of the things we talked about yesterday on iOS today
[01:45:03.440 --> 01:45:06.480]   since lot of us, uh, you know
[01:45:06.480 --> 01:45:08.720]   Pickleball is one thing
[01:45:08.720 --> 01:45:12.320]   But a lot of us like to get together with friends and play board games and things
[01:45:12.320 --> 01:45:16.480]   And uh, there's a program called house party which runs on iOS and android
[01:45:16.480 --> 01:45:19.600]   Have you ever played you? I know stacey you've played heads up
[01:45:20.480 --> 01:45:25.440]   Have you played that game the game where you have the heads? Yeah head band. Yeah, yeah, we play that so fun
[01:45:25.440 --> 01:45:29.760]   So you put on uh, you put the game on your phone and it'll show a name of somebody
[01:45:29.760 --> 01:45:32.400]   Like andre agassi
[01:45:32.400 --> 01:45:35.600]   And then you can't see it because it's on your forehead and everybody
[01:45:35.600 --> 01:45:40.080]   All the people in the group are trying to tell with that's it's like password without saying andre agassi
[01:45:40.080 --> 01:45:45.600]   He's a tennis player. He's it and you're trying to guess it if you get it right you go down and it goes to the next one
[01:45:45.600 --> 01:45:47.360]   If you get it if you want to skip it, you go up
[01:45:47.840 --> 01:45:51.280]   It's a very fun game. You could buy packs and stuff. So that's in house party
[01:45:51.280 --> 01:45:56.400]   So you can play if you're you know, you and your daughter are stuck and you want to play with her friends
[01:45:56.400 --> 01:45:59.040]   Here we are playing house party on iOS today
[01:45:59.040 --> 01:46:02.400]   Uh, that's mica and his friend lisabeth
[01:46:02.400 --> 01:46:07.840]   Isn't that cute? I think it's really it's a good better way actually better way to play heads up
[01:46:07.840 --> 01:46:11.360]   I think they have some other games in there too. So play together. I guess it's gonna be a
[01:46:11.360 --> 01:46:15.200]   A new feature we'll see in google play games stuff like this
[01:46:16.080 --> 01:46:23.440]   I like it. Isn't that cool? I need to yeah, because I was thinking how I wanted like a chat roulette for games right during this time of
[01:46:23.440 --> 01:46:30.240]   Sadness so like imagine if you could just like click through and maybe you're in the middle of a bingo game and you can join in or
[01:46:30.240 --> 01:46:34.880]   Shurbaze or whatever that game is where you stick everybody famous in a bowl and yeah
[01:46:34.880 --> 01:46:37.520]   Exactly. I was like, oh
[01:46:37.520 --> 01:46:39.760]   I need that
[01:46:39.760 --> 01:46:44.800]   That's well. I'm just saying this is it we're all you know stuck inside uh quarantining ourselves
[01:46:45.120 --> 01:46:49.520]   This would be fun. You could play house party with friends kind of get some sort of I'd like to see more
[01:46:49.520 --> 01:46:51.680]   You know, there's some really fun card games
[01:46:51.680 --> 01:47:00.000]   Uh with special decks. There's karkasan and the other new style board games. Yes, I'd love to see more of that, right?
[01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:04.720]   It's hard to do some of that though with uh, yeah online. Yeah, yeah
[01:47:04.720 --> 01:47:08.960]   We were we were trying to think about having uh playing like karkasan or
[01:47:08.960 --> 01:47:11.840]   We were trying to figure out bridge
[01:47:12.720 --> 01:47:17.600]   It doesn't work. That's too bad because now you're too young for bridge. I'm too young for bridge
[01:47:17.600 --> 01:47:24.400]   I know that old soul in a young body. I thought it'd be a good time to learn bridge and then I realized it would not why?
[01:47:24.400 --> 01:47:31.120]   Because it's actually a good game my in-laws play bridge. Oh, that's a great. They tried to teach me it's it's actually
[01:47:31.120 --> 01:47:36.720]   Not the bad thing. Oh, I could know my poor parents tried a million times. I can't have that and cricket. I cannot get my head around
[01:47:36.720 --> 01:47:39.280]   I just can't they're both pretty complicated. Yeah
[01:47:39.280 --> 01:47:42.000]   cricket with the wickets
[01:47:42.480 --> 01:47:44.800]   Uh with the wickets cricket cricket
[01:47:44.800 --> 01:47:50.160]   Or no cricket with a okay cricket cricket with a bat in the english
[01:47:50.160 --> 01:47:56.640]   Right. Yeah. Yeah, I don't know. It goes on five years each game. Yeah, you know, who's a huge cricket fan
[01:47:56.640 --> 01:47:59.520]   Sundar pachai
[01:47:59.520 --> 01:48:02.160]   Uh-huh. Oh, he's loves the cricket
[01:48:02.160 --> 01:48:04.800]   Google hangouts. There's
[01:48:04.800 --> 01:48:08.000]   Now
[01:48:08.000 --> 01:48:11.760]   I know we're not supposed to use hangouts. I'm a google fi subscriber
[01:48:11.760 --> 01:48:16.640]   It's the it's the only messaging application. I can use it runs everywhere. I love ghoul hangouts
[01:48:16.640 --> 01:48:21.840]   They haven't updated it. They're now removing stuff bit by bit. They're going to take this thing apart
[01:48:21.840 --> 01:48:29.200]   They're going to tear off little pieces. Here's ronamatio's article. They're now taking out that really handy feature. Send my location
[01:48:29.200 --> 01:48:32.080]   No
[01:48:32.080 --> 01:48:35.600]   That's really distressing. I actually uh
[01:48:36.640 --> 01:48:41.840]   Should I do a name drop here humble brag? I sure I used that with steve martin
[01:48:41.840 --> 01:48:44.480]   Whoa, I was visiting new york
[01:48:44.480 --> 01:48:47.920]   And I was supposed to go over to their place for dinner
[01:48:47.920 --> 01:48:50.560]   And I said well, where are you?
[01:48:50.560 --> 01:48:52.560]   And uh, and he dropped a pin
[01:48:52.560 --> 01:48:58.080]   And then I dropped a pin because I was walking saying well here's i'm walking here. Here's where I am
[01:48:58.080 --> 01:49:04.000]   I'm walking here. He's quite a nerd and we celebrated our nerdiness when I got there. He said see I did the I said yeah
[01:49:05.280 --> 01:49:07.280]   No more steve sorry
[01:49:07.280 --> 01:49:15.280]   Google launches android 11 developer preview 2 with foldable call screening and neural networks api improvements
[01:49:15.280 --> 01:49:23.600]   Huh, huh, you know what else was abandoned where for the longest time remember google bought snap seed
[01:49:23.600 --> 01:49:28.400]   Which was the most I might have yeah, we moved on that was it. That was the headline. That's all i'm gonna say
[01:49:28.400 --> 01:49:35.200]   Sorry, I just was like foldable. What what's kind of oh because they're supporting photable phones now like the zfl
[01:49:35.440 --> 01:49:41.120]   And the scallopsy fold and all that stuff got it there was actually interesting things there, but okay go on
[01:49:41.120 --> 01:49:46.640]   Well, we can go back to it. No, no, no, no, no you go ahead. I'll I'll read it in my own sweet time
[01:49:46.640 --> 01:49:51.520]   She just loves the word neural network. I did okay
[01:49:51.520 --> 01:49:54.320]   You want I was like what are they?
[01:49:54.320 --> 01:49:56.960]   Is this yes or is this not?
[01:49:56.960 --> 01:50:04.800]   I know what we were before yeah 5g experiences people in conversation improvements neural network api 1.30
[01:50:04.880 --> 01:50:11.920]   Okay, yeah, never mind meanwhile snap seed which was an excellent program google bought it gave it away for free
[01:50:11.920 --> 01:50:15.040]   It's the best photo editor. I think it's wonderful and wrote in iOS
[01:50:15.040 --> 01:50:19.120]   Hasn't been updated in like two years. They just updated it
[01:50:19.120 --> 01:50:26.400]   Well, hapsi the put so so it's not dead yet. This is this is what we're reduced to
[01:50:26.400 --> 01:50:32.480]   Celebrating a minor update to snap seed, but at least it's alive
[01:50:33.280 --> 01:50:39.840]   The neural networks api is actually pretty cool. Okay, let's you run neural networks on your cell phone
[01:50:39.840 --> 01:50:45.520]   So you can is a developer you can tap into this if you have something that
[01:50:45.520 --> 01:50:53.680]   You want to do run an neural network basically and this will do it in a way that is more battery efficient
[01:50:53.680 --> 01:50:57.280]   And help you out. So that's actually kind of neat
[01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:04.240]   Okay, actually there's one more story that's like the house party story. There's a new google chrome extension
[01:51:04.240 --> 01:51:09.680]   Netflix party calm that lets you watch Netflix with friends online
[01:51:09.680 --> 01:51:13.600]   It synchronizes video playback and adds group chat
[01:51:13.600 --> 01:51:18.800]   So when you're watching a show and you want to watch it with friends
[01:51:18.800 --> 01:51:21.920]   Netflix party calm
[01:51:21.920 --> 01:51:26.240]   There's a patreon page so you can support it. I think this is a great idea and perfect timing
[01:51:26.240 --> 01:51:31.840]   Did this with watch? Yeah, remember that. Yeah, yeah, yeah, but there's so everybody has Netflix, right?
[01:51:31.840 --> 01:51:41.600]   So, uh, I mean my parents don't what I know every time I go like every time every time they tell me this because i'm constantly forgetting i'm like
[01:51:41.600 --> 01:51:47.760]   How do you live in the world? We have Amazon Prime. I'm like, it's pretty good. I gave my mom
[01:51:47.760 --> 01:51:51.360]   Have you seen the new season of battle on Berlin? No, i'm so excited
[01:51:51.360 --> 01:51:53.280]   Is it good?
[01:51:53.280 --> 01:51:59.040]   I have just started watching just turn that now word of warning. It's in German jeff speaks German
[01:51:59.040 --> 01:52:05.600]   So he doesn't know very badly do not watch the dubbed version. There is one. It's awful watch the sub titled one
[01:52:05.600 --> 01:52:08.720]   So there is subtitles and some people don't like reading while they're watching tv
[01:52:08.720 --> 01:52:15.040]   But it is a great show about 1920s Berlin. It's a crime show murder mystery show
[01:52:15.040 --> 01:52:19.520]   And it's kind of interesting historically they it's based on a series of novels
[01:52:20.320 --> 01:52:22.320]   very popular in Germany i'm told that
[01:52:22.320 --> 01:52:28.960]   I think there's eight or nine of them they go through the 20s leading up to the through the ascendancy of Hitler
[01:52:28.960 --> 01:52:31.120]   So the first season
[01:52:31.120 --> 01:52:38.960]   Was just the beginning of the nazi party. So that's kind of the backdrop of it which makes it very I think really good and it's the most expensive
[01:52:38.960 --> 01:52:41.520]   Uh
[01:52:41.520 --> 01:52:43.520]   TV show ever made outside of the us
[01:52:43.520 --> 01:52:49.920]   Very they put a lot of money into it and you could it shows man. It shows. It's really well done. I thought
[01:52:50.080 --> 01:52:54.400]   Yeah, I can't wait to see you see it's called babylon babylon berlin
[01:52:54.400 --> 01:52:58.320]   And it's on Netflix. Yeah, I wish you better know and it's it's
[01:52:58.320 --> 01:53:03.360]   Um, yeah, when you have nothing to do when you're locked inside. It's that of the perfect show
[01:53:03.360 --> 01:53:09.200]   Did you watch watch west world sunday night? No, no, you don't care
[01:53:09.200 --> 01:53:13.680]   No, we're over west's world now. They've left the park. We did a whole new world
[01:53:13.680 --> 01:53:19.520]   I kind of liked it because they're finally out of the park. I tried. Okay. So I know it's coming on sunday night
[01:53:19.920 --> 01:53:24.240]   Saturday night. I said all right. I I can't I it's too complicated. I can't remember what happened
[01:53:24.240 --> 01:53:29.200]   I tried I watched two different youtube supercuts where they
[01:53:29.200 --> 01:53:36.240]   attempt to explain in chronological order because the show does not happen in chronologicaler what happened in west world season one and two
[01:53:36.240 --> 01:53:41.120]   It took 15 minutes of very fast talking and I was more baffled at the end
[01:53:41.120 --> 01:53:46.240]   That show is insane. It's but they threw that all out
[01:53:47.760 --> 01:53:51.520]   All you have to know is the robots got out and now what happens? So if I
[01:53:51.520 --> 01:53:57.600]   Was the rest of it I could watch now, huh? You could take over or watch it. Oh, no. Absolutely. Here's here's what you need to know
[01:53:57.600 --> 01:54:04.320]   There was an amusement park create well you already know you saw the you'll bring her movie amusement park created where robots
[01:54:04.320 --> 01:54:09.440]   Play roles you get to go and roll play with them as a human you can't get hurt
[01:54:09.440 --> 01:54:16.400]   Eventually though, uh, what happens in the west world saga is the robots become sentient
[01:54:17.200 --> 01:54:19.200]   And realize it sucks
[01:54:19.200 --> 01:54:24.080]   They keep killing us and we can't kill them they rise up they kill everybody
[01:54:24.080 --> 01:54:28.800]   all the humans and uh and one of them escapes with the
[01:54:28.800 --> 01:54:34.480]   Personality balls of five more because it's all in a little globe in the back of their head
[01:54:34.480 --> 01:54:41.440]   And now she's wreaking havoc in the and it's the distant future. It's like a couple hundred years in the future, but it's cool
[01:54:41.440 --> 01:54:47.120]   and um, you know, it's it's a you know, I think it's pretty good at least I only saw one episode
[01:54:47.200 --> 01:54:48.800]   pretty good
[01:54:48.800 --> 01:54:52.880]   It's nothing like the the first two episodes which were impossible to follow
[01:54:52.880 --> 01:54:55.840]   And I like Jonathan no one but
[01:54:55.840 --> 01:54:59.200]   All right, and that um
[01:54:59.200 --> 01:55:01.200]   M is your google changelog
[01:55:01.200 --> 01:55:04.960]   Plus a lot of stuff having nothing to do with google
[01:55:04.960 --> 01:55:12.880]   Because that's us because we don't care. We have nowhere to go. It's the new changelog plus
[01:55:13.440 --> 01:55:19.600]   All right, she's got dinner. She has the meatballs to go to get meatballs. Let me uh, there's actually a bunch of good news
[01:55:19.600 --> 01:55:21.600]   I'm gonna run through shall I?
[01:55:21.600 --> 01:55:31.680]   Or did you I'm sorry particular google story or this one is not but it's really cool the uncensored library
[01:55:31.680 --> 01:55:35.120]   So reporters without borders
[01:55:35.120 --> 01:55:40.560]   Did something kind of amazing of course as you know, uh, journalism is censored
[01:55:41.200 --> 01:55:43.360]   in many countries all around the world
[01:55:43.360 --> 01:55:46.960]   They created a minecraft level
[01:55:46.960 --> 01:55:49.520]   By the way, it is gorgeous
[01:55:49.520 --> 01:55:52.960]   It is 12 and a half million minecraft bricks
[01:55:52.960 --> 01:55:55.840]   It's called the uncensored library
[01:55:55.840 --> 01:56:02.080]   You can wander around you can put it on your own server if you want and the reason they did this is the countries that block
[01:56:02.080 --> 01:56:05.520]   journalism and facebook and twitter and all that don't block
[01:56:05.520 --> 01:56:09.120]   Minecraft why would anybody block minecraft
[01:56:09.680 --> 01:56:11.280]   Is it now is good?
[01:56:11.280 --> 01:56:16.800]   So you can go in there and read censored books read censored news
[01:56:16.800 --> 01:56:20.400]   Because it's in the library including a whole section
[01:56:20.400 --> 01:56:26.080]   About kashogi, which of course, I'm sure you can't read anything about kashogi in um
[01:56:26.080 --> 01:56:30.720]   In souty Arabia jama like kashogi the murdered souty and Arabian journalist
[01:56:30.720 --> 01:56:33.840]   Uh, there is a whole kashogi tribute in there
[01:56:34.400 --> 01:56:40.400]   There's also stuff from an Egyptian news site that reports on corruption has been blocked in egypt for three years
[01:56:40.400 --> 01:56:47.520]   Uh, it's there's stories from a blocked russian site that reports on protests and activism. What a good idea
[01:56:47.520 --> 01:56:53.040]   And uh, I actually downloaded it because I have a minecraft server and I want to put it on there
[01:56:53.040 --> 01:56:57.040]   But you can log in there's a there's a links in the various articles
[01:56:57.040 --> 01:57:03.440]   And all you have to do is have the minecraft the java bedrock version of minecraft and you can go into the server and read
[01:57:03.520 --> 01:57:06.240]   And I think that's brilliant. I think it's brilliant
[01:57:06.240 --> 01:57:11.120]   Uh, that's good news here's some more good news
[01:57:11.120 --> 01:57:14.480]   The touring prize has been awarded
[01:57:14.480 --> 01:57:19.760]   A one million dollar it's kind of a nobel prize of computing one million dollar prize
[01:57:19.760 --> 01:57:22.560]   Oh, this times wants me to log in
[01:57:22.560 --> 01:57:24.960]   Look, I'm a member
[01:57:24.960 --> 01:57:29.280]   You always forget made me ark times you always forget me. They are forgetful
[01:57:30.800 --> 01:57:37.040]   Let me log in real quickly. They're not as bad as the wall street journal or wired good lord wired just I don't even know
[01:57:37.040 --> 01:57:39.520]   I just stopped subscribing to it's just
[01:57:39.520 --> 01:57:45.680]   I'm like you're just making it too hard. I actually get money on it. So your password. It's so annoying
[01:57:45.680 --> 01:57:47.600]   Anyway
[01:57:47.600 --> 01:57:51.760]   Ed catmull and pat hanahan who worked at pixar
[01:57:51.760 --> 01:57:59.280]   And created amazing stuff including render man all the stuff that the pixar uses to create computer graphics for movies
[01:57:59.840 --> 01:58:03.360]   Um, one million dollar touring prize. It is the most
[01:58:03.360 --> 01:58:06.960]   It's not about the money. I'm sure ed doesn't need the money
[01:58:06.960 --> 01:58:13.600]   But it's really about the acknowledgement of their contribution the touring award the nobel prize of computing
[01:58:13.600 --> 01:58:18.800]   From the association of computing machinery
[01:58:18.800 --> 01:58:22.000]   Um
[01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.720]   Wasn't that funded by um, ACM
[01:58:24.720 --> 01:58:27.680]   No, that was the russian funded it. That was a different
[01:58:28.480 --> 01:58:32.640]   No, no, I don't think so. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no one no one some oligarch
[01:58:32.640 --> 01:58:35.840]   Yes, yes
[01:58:35.840 --> 01:58:36.560]   Uh
[01:58:36.560 --> 01:58:40.880]   Facebook has set up a time server that instead of being off by 10 milliseconds
[01:58:40.880 --> 01:58:45.360]   I'm about 100 milliseconds is only off by 10 milliseconds or less
[01:58:45.360 --> 01:58:52.080]   We don't care. Oh, are we talking about timing? Yes time servers and ntp
[01:58:52.080 --> 01:58:55.200]   About that. Yeah, it's an IEEE interview about it
[01:58:55.200 --> 01:58:57.920]   Tell me about it. You are now the expert
[01:58:58.800 --> 01:59:01.680]   Oh, well, I don't know about the facebook one yet because I haven't read it
[01:59:01.680 --> 01:59:04.240]   But I get so excited about timing
[01:59:04.240 --> 01:59:09.920]   Um, because it's crucial timing is essential to everything we do on the internet
[01:59:09.920 --> 01:59:16.640]   And so I I tweeted it to bookmark it for later basically. Yeah, sorry. Yeah, so apparently, um
[01:59:16.640 --> 01:59:22.080]   It's a super precise, you know, ntp is the network time protocol
[01:59:22.080 --> 01:59:27.120]   You you probably are sinking to it with your computer. That's pretty typically what happens
[01:59:27.600 --> 01:59:29.600]   They've improved the accuracy
[01:59:29.600 --> 01:59:31.440]   Of their time server
[01:59:31.440 --> 01:59:37.920]   From one from 10 milliseconds to 100 micro seconds. Wow. That's that's pretty dang accurate
[01:59:37.920 --> 01:59:43.680]   And so yeah, my friend from my editor at i triple a spectrum where I write she
[01:59:43.680 --> 01:59:49.360]   Said me the article on juda levine levine levine who invented ntp
[01:59:49.360 --> 01:59:51.840]   Because I said I like this. Oh, that's neat. So
[01:59:51.840 --> 01:59:56.640]   Here's a here's a story. I'll throw this in the chat room for super nerds
[01:59:56.960 --> 02:00:00.720]   The big challenge of course. I don't care if my computer is 10 milliseconds off
[02:00:00.720 --> 02:00:07.120]   The big challenge though is because of latency getting that accurate to get it down 100 microseconds. I don't know how they do it
[02:00:07.120 --> 02:00:14.640]   Yeah, well timing is so important all across the internet think about all of their databases that are trying to get synced think about things like geolocation
[02:00:14.640 --> 02:00:16.240]   tracking satellites
[02:00:16.240 --> 02:00:21.760]   And as we put more devices on the internet and start collecting data for them, especially devices that are moving
[02:00:21.760 --> 02:00:26.000]   We're going to have to have a much better sense of timing and
[02:00:26.880 --> 02:00:29.280]   It's super nerdy, but if it gets off track, you know
[02:00:29.280 --> 02:00:32.640]   Everything goes to hell bad things happen
[02:00:32.640 --> 02:00:42.160]   Um anyway, I have to allow this in my facebook container on firefox firefox won't let me go to time dot facebook dot com but you can
[02:00:42.160 --> 02:00:50.640]   I well I dropped a link in for the thing on ntp's founder and then the link name in the i triple a for the facebook new timing
[02:00:50.720 --> 02:00:57.440]   I said nntp which I think is the newsgroups server. It's right ntp. Oh ntp. I said it wrong. I
[02:00:57.440 --> 02:01:02.800]   Heard you say ntp. Yeah, I just said I stuttered. Oh and look we have a floss weekly
[02:01:02.800 --> 02:01:06.320]   All about ntp if you really like it geeky
[02:01:06.320 --> 02:01:11.600]   Ntp we need it. It's actually had a problem with the surfer software that allowed
[02:01:11.600 --> 02:01:18.320]   As I remember amplification effects attacks was a problem. I'm sure they fixed that by now
[02:01:19.520 --> 02:01:25.440]   Uh t-mobile is getting emergency access to dishes 600 megahertz spectrum. This is something they gave up
[02:01:25.440 --> 02:01:32.000]   Uh as part of the merger with a sprint but in our current crisis, they're going to get it back
[02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:36.960]   And hey
[02:01:36.960 --> 02:01:42.320]   That's good spectrum right there. That's the good stuff. That's the good stuff. T-mobile calls it 5 g
[02:01:44.400 --> 02:01:51.120]   Well, I mean technically it is right if they're deploying the g sma. Yeah, they are g sma 5 g standard
[02:01:51.120 --> 02:01:55.760]   Technically they are over that spectrum. That's fine. It's just not that fast, but it's good
[02:01:55.760 --> 02:02:02.960]   Uh to be do you watch to be every time I say I talk about cord cutting and I always get emails from people say
[02:02:02.960 --> 02:02:08.160]   Leo you say cord cutting isn't a good idea. I don't I love cord cutting
[02:02:08.160 --> 02:02:11.920]   But I say mostly it's just giving you the satisfaction of sticking it to the man
[02:02:11.920 --> 02:02:19.920]   You probably aren't going to save any money because by the time you buy the bandwidth and Netflix and amazon prime and youtube tv or whatever
[02:02:19.920 --> 02:02:22.480]   You're going to end up spending the same amount you would spend with a cable company
[02:02:22.480 --> 02:02:27.520]   But he says my correspondent, but Leo don't you know about to be
[02:02:27.520 --> 02:02:31.920]   T u bi it's a streaming over the top
[02:02:31.920 --> 02:02:34.960]   ad supported service that's free
[02:02:34.960 --> 02:02:38.160]   20,000 movies and shows you don't want to watch
[02:02:39.120 --> 02:02:43.280]   But it's free and there's ads in it. You don't want to watch but it's free
[02:02:43.280 --> 02:02:52.160]   Uh 25 million users right now fox which doesn't fox does not 20 service-centric fox which disney bought fox
[02:02:52.160 --> 02:02:58.960]   Doesn't have a streaming platform. So they just bought to be for 440 million dollars
[02:02:58.960 --> 02:03:02.880]   So there
[02:03:03.920 --> 02:03:10.960]   Lachlan Murdoch said importantly coupled with the combined power of fox's existing networks, you know what they are
[02:03:10.960 --> 02:03:14.240]   Too many they're not going to have a news network part of it
[02:03:14.240 --> 02:03:21.840]   Isn't they are provides a substantial base from which we will drive long-term growth in the direct-to-consumer arena
[02:03:21.840 --> 02:03:26.320]   It's challenging, you know fox msnbc and cnn have problem because they
[02:03:26.320 --> 02:03:28.960]   They need the cable companies, right?
[02:03:28.960 --> 02:03:34.160]   That's really 90% of their audience is coming through your cable, but they'd love to go over the top
[02:03:34.160 --> 02:03:39.840]   They'd love to eliminate, you know giving Comcast and Cox and charter all the money
[02:03:39.840 --> 02:03:43.600]   They'd love to just you know go over the top actually it's the other way
[02:03:43.600 --> 02:03:47.600]   But they actually it is the other way right fox charter
[02:03:47.600 --> 02:03:55.120]   Charter pays for msnbc, but they would like to just get the money directly from you
[02:03:55.520 --> 02:03:57.040]   That's what i'm saying
[02:03:57.040 --> 02:04:01.600]   And they can maybe make a little bit more but they can't go over the top because almost always I know this from tech tv
[02:04:01.600 --> 02:04:05.120]   They're deals where say you can't you know, you can't stream one 10 minutes or whatever
[02:04:05.120 --> 02:04:11.840]   So uh, but maybe this is the beginning, you know, maybe they'll make a special fox streaming fox something like that
[02:04:11.840 --> 02:04:19.840]   Um, I have nothing more to say you have any stories I missed that I uh, I should have said something about let's see here
[02:04:19.840 --> 02:04:24.560]   The German military laptop that was sold on ebay
[02:04:25.360 --> 02:04:27.360]   with classified data
[02:04:27.360 --> 02:04:30.400]   Mm-hmm
[02:04:30.400 --> 02:04:36.480]   Security researchers bought a boonders vair laptop for just 90 euros good deal
[02:04:36.480 --> 02:04:41.680]   Inside documents on a mobile missile system used by the german arm forces
[02:04:41.680 --> 02:04:44.960]   Looks like a good laptop too, doesn't it?
[02:04:44.960 --> 02:04:51.760]   Good decent German construction looks like some compact i owned years ago
[02:04:53.120 --> 02:04:55.840]   It's definitely mil speck definitely definitely mil speck
[02:04:55.840 --> 02:04:58.160]   um
[02:04:58.160 --> 02:05:01.360]   Any other stories let's see here, uh, we did it
[02:05:01.360 --> 02:05:06.240]   Oh, we do have a picture of mrs. subways
[02:05:06.240 --> 02:05:10.640]   Didn't they also have miss nicker bocker?
[02:05:10.640 --> 02:05:16.240]   I thought the beer nicker bocker beer would they put up a poster in the subway with miss nicker bocker every month
[02:05:16.240 --> 02:05:20.320]   There's miss subways see the girls on telepoles
[02:05:20.320 --> 02:05:22.720]   and vote
[02:05:22.720 --> 02:05:25.040]   for our loveliest subway rider
[02:05:25.040 --> 02:05:28.000]   miss subway
[02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:30.480]   Oh
[02:05:30.480 --> 02:05:32.480]   I think stacy hung up on me after that
[02:05:32.480 --> 02:05:35.840]   I probably deserved it
[02:05:35.840 --> 02:05:38.480]   Off to make meatballs. Did she just leave?
[02:05:38.480 --> 02:05:41.440]   Is she wave goodbye?
[02:05:41.440 --> 02:05:47.520]   Oh here she comes jef a number for us, please. Oh a number number number number number number
[02:05:47.520 --> 02:05:51.360]   Number number number number number. Let's see. Let's see. We're talking to do
[02:05:51.440 --> 02:05:52.880]   Uh
[02:05:52.880 --> 02:05:55.120]   Scroll down. Okay. Um
[02:05:55.120 --> 02:06:00.240]   Oh, I know what i'm gonna do i'm gonna do a fun one. All right, so do you know choir choir choir choir? No
[02:06:00.240 --> 02:06:05.680]   Choir choir choir is wonderful a Canadian based, um
[02:06:05.680 --> 02:06:07.520]   group
[02:06:07.520 --> 02:06:12.160]   That takes over large spaces and invites sometimes couple thousand people to come
[02:06:12.160 --> 02:06:17.040]   And all then they teach them all to sing the same song. Oh, that's neat
[02:06:17.840 --> 02:06:19.840]   And they do like a flash mob
[02:06:19.840 --> 02:06:24.720]   He kind of yeah, but but with a little more training and effort and it's a lot of fun
[02:06:24.720 --> 02:06:30.160]   It's really really great those two guys right in front of that picture you have there are they are the the mobsters
[02:06:30.160 --> 02:06:33.920]   Oh, I hear this in a heartbeat. I've always it's why I'd love to do it
[02:06:33.920 --> 02:06:36.400]   They do it a can't do it elsewhere
[02:06:36.400 --> 02:06:39.680]   But huge huge crowds singing something great
[02:06:39.680 --> 02:06:43.760]   Um, well now they can't do crowds. What oh?
[02:06:44.640 --> 02:06:48.320]   So they went on to uh, facebook last night
[02:06:48.320 --> 02:06:54.560]   That's why I was on facebook because I was watching them just singing and then people were putting out their own facebook's as they're singing along
[02:06:54.560 --> 02:06:57.760]   It was really pretty great
[02:06:57.760 --> 02:07:00.240]   And um
[02:07:00.240 --> 02:07:04.640]   There was their distance singing along. I can't play any of these videos unfortunately
[02:07:04.640 --> 02:07:09.440]   I know it's killing me. I saw it's not a good number to do but choir choir choir is choir times three
[02:07:09.440 --> 02:07:13.920]   That's why I figured it was a number and they're gonna do it again saturday. Oh good
[02:07:14.480 --> 02:07:21.920]   So saturday afternoon, that's all I'm I'm waiting for the the image of of leo at home singing along
[02:07:21.920 --> 02:07:28.080]   That was really that was the origination of musically which then got bought by tick tock
[02:07:28.080 --> 02:07:30.960]   Was people lip syncing and singing along?
[02:07:30.960 --> 02:07:37.360]   Stacy is back. Sorry about that. I don't know what happened there. No, it's all right. No, I accidentally hung up
[02:07:37.360 --> 02:07:39.920]   I thought you were mad at me accidentally
[02:07:39.920 --> 02:07:43.440]   No
[02:07:43.440 --> 02:07:47.520]   History that's history. So what stop it going
[02:07:47.520 --> 02:07:51.680]   What is your uh stacy's thing of the week?
[02:07:51.680 --> 02:07:57.520]   So it's actually a place. Um, this is skyba scientist go to skyba scientist.com
[02:07:57.520 --> 02:07:59.440]   It's not an exciting website
[02:07:59.440 --> 02:08:03.520]   But what it is is if you sign up there as a parent or as a scientist
[02:08:03.520 --> 02:08:07.760]   You will get on an email list and they will email you the topics for each week
[02:08:07.760 --> 02:08:12.800]   So this week we had oh, yeah, but do we have oh, so this would be uh addition
[02:08:12.880 --> 02:08:18.080]   This is so this is teaching your kids probably it's younger kids, but even adults
[02:08:18.080 --> 02:08:19.840]   Um
[02:08:19.840 --> 02:08:24.880]   Let me just pull up the schedule. Um, I watched one about giant rats
[02:08:24.880 --> 02:08:30.240]   Um, oh geez Stacy for animal for animal communication
[02:08:30.240 --> 02:08:34.640]   It was a scientist who works with giant rats in studies like how animals communicate with one another
[02:08:34.640 --> 02:08:37.200]   It was really fascinating. Um, there are
[02:08:37.200 --> 02:08:41.200]   In New York in New York if I may if I may hold you there is a rat academy
[02:08:41.520 --> 02:08:43.520]   very
[02:08:43.520 --> 02:08:46.480]   Scary
[02:08:46.480 --> 02:08:50.080]   Holds the regular rat academy academy training
[02:08:50.080 --> 02:08:56.800]   So if you really want to get into rats, this is your pet. Oh my god. All right. So this week was
[02:08:56.800 --> 02:09:00.080]   No, that's okay
[02:09:00.080 --> 02:09:04.560]   Um, how does animal behavior affect infectious disease with nick keizer?
[02:09:04.560 --> 02:09:09.920]   He uh, he studies behavioral disease ecology. So, um, and then there's
[02:09:10.640 --> 02:09:16.480]   March 19th, which is tomorrow at noon eastern. There's a paleontologist who's going to talk about fossils
[02:09:16.480 --> 02:09:21.920]   Um, some of the other ones are ants zookeeping poop corvids
[02:09:21.920 --> 02:09:24.000]   bats
[02:09:24.000 --> 02:09:28.240]   Chuck windig is hosting a book club. There's a book on science
[02:09:28.240 --> 02:09:29.920]   The moon
[02:09:29.920 --> 02:09:33.200]   So you can sign up if you're a scientist to do a session
[02:09:33.200 --> 02:09:38.960]   But if your kids are home for school they can participate via skype if you sign up for this which
[02:09:39.600 --> 02:09:42.640]   Why wouldn't you it's I mean you may not do everyone but
[02:09:42.640 --> 02:09:48.160]   It's kind of fun. I love that and so it's a big group and then the scientists presents
[02:09:48.160 --> 02:09:53.280]   Yeah, the scientist presents. I don't know if you can ask I think you could ask questions in the chat
[02:09:53.280 --> 02:09:55.680]   I didn't I didn't pay attention because I I was
[02:09:55.680 --> 02:09:58.320]   Watching the sign I didn't have again
[02:09:58.320 --> 02:10:03.440]   This would be so much harder if we didn't have the internet and honestly this is an opportunity at this point
[02:10:03.440 --> 02:10:08.000]   To take some time and learn something or just broaden your horizons
[02:10:08.240 --> 02:10:11.840]   Carston had a pic. I'm on give him a pic of the week because he stuck at home
[02:10:11.840 --> 02:10:19.600]   It's when I completely agree with harvard's world famous introduction to computing class cs 50 is online
[02:10:19.600 --> 02:10:22.000]   for free
[02:10:22.000 --> 02:10:23.200]   in fact, I've been
[02:10:23.200 --> 02:10:28.880]   Desperately, I actually I'm signed up for it. I've taken a few of it's really really really really good
[02:10:28.880 --> 02:10:31.600]   um, and uh
[02:10:31.600 --> 02:10:35.600]   I've actually been trying to get michael and his buddies to do this because they have some interest
[02:10:36.160 --> 02:10:38.960]   In this you can get ap credit if you're a high schooler
[02:10:38.960 --> 02:10:45.760]   Um, you you could also I guess take it for a certificate at edx which is where it is edx
[02:10:45.760 --> 02:10:52.080]   Uh, dot org, which is by the way a great place created by harvard at mit for
[02:10:52.080 --> 02:10:59.280]   online education. They do a really good job and this is videos of the cs 50 courses
[02:10:59.280 --> 02:11:02.080]   but it's also
[02:11:02.320 --> 02:11:07.520]   Worksheets and problem sets and stuff so it's it's not you know passive. You can really get involved
[02:11:07.520 --> 02:11:11.200]   I enjoyed it a lot. I thought it was these guys are really good instructors
[02:11:11.200 --> 02:11:17.680]   It moves fast remember harvard kids are smarter than us yelkids. So it moves pretty darn fast
[02:11:17.680 --> 02:11:23.120]   Uh, but uh if you if you're not if you can if you can keep up, I think it's really worthwhile
[02:11:23.120 --> 02:11:24.640]   I think if
[02:11:24.640 --> 02:11:26.640]   I wanted to do it as kind of uh
[02:11:26.640 --> 02:11:32.160]   The syllabus for you know and I would take some time then to talk with them and do problems and help them along
[02:11:32.480 --> 02:11:34.720]   So if you wanted to teach some kids
[02:11:34.720 --> 02:11:40.480]   Uh, this is a really good way to do it or learn for yourself cs 50 and do check out everything
[02:11:40.480 --> 02:11:45.040]   At edx they have some great classes including the best programming course
[02:11:45.040 --> 02:11:47.280]   how to code
[02:11:47.280 --> 02:11:49.600]   Uh, which is a really fabulous course
[02:11:49.600 --> 02:11:51.360]   Um
[02:11:51.360 --> 02:11:57.440]   But a lot of a lot of courses and a lot of different subjects that's karstens pick cs 50 harvard's introduction to computer science
[02:11:57.680 --> 02:12:03.440]   Karsten we miss you. Hey, did you take karsten? Did you take cs 50 when you were in school there?
[02:12:03.440 --> 02:12:05.920]   Nobody nobody's there
[02:12:05.920 --> 02:12:11.600]   Nobody nobody there karstens like see yel later. I got things to do. No, no, he's not here
[02:12:11.600 --> 02:12:16.960]   No, he can actually can you just pull up a stick with a bow tie on it? Yeah, that's a good idea
[02:12:16.960 --> 02:12:23.360]   He wanted a karsten camera. I'd be there that maybe you could put a stick with a bow tie. No, he's at home. He's he's participating
[02:12:23.360 --> 02:12:24.640]   he's producing
[02:12:24.640 --> 02:12:26.560]   uh, but he is uh
[02:12:26.560 --> 02:12:30.960]   He's at home. This is snark. Hey, that's not all I miss
[02:12:30.960 --> 02:12:35.120]   Um
[02:12:35.120 --> 02:12:36.320]   Oh
[02:12:36.320 --> 02:12:40.560]   And then I had a pick which I don't I just heard about I'm not yet doing it
[02:12:40.560 --> 02:12:43.680]   But i'm curious about it around dot co
[02:12:43.680 --> 02:12:48.000]   Quick high impact video calls for a new era of work
[02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:53.200]   There's they've just coming out of a private beta into a public beta which you could sign up for I have
[02:12:53.600 --> 02:12:57.120]   And if you get into it, you can invite your your colleagues
[02:12:57.120 --> 02:13:02.320]   Uh, it says we took video meetings and made them less less obtrusive less clunky
[02:13:02.320 --> 02:13:05.760]   A clear view of your teammates while making space for work
[02:13:05.760 --> 02:13:09.280]   This is the interesting thing the camera framing
[02:13:09.280 --> 02:13:12.720]   Is a I best based so
[02:13:12.720 --> 02:13:18.640]   You don't have to worry about your background it follows it finds your faces you move craps craps out clutter
[02:13:18.640 --> 02:13:22.160]   Crops out clutter and other background distractions
[02:13:22.800 --> 02:13:26.640]   So you don't have to worry about laundry or your bed unmade
[02:13:26.640 --> 02:13:28.720]   Auto mute from
[02:13:28.720 --> 02:13:33.360]   No dog barking no washing machines. It sounds really interesting multiple laptops
[02:13:33.360 --> 02:13:38.960]   All mics on in the same place no echo. That's always been a problem
[02:13:38.960 --> 02:13:42.880]   Uh for Lisa and me I have to go in another room before on a conference call together
[02:13:42.880 --> 02:13:49.200]   Um, but this looks really interesting now. I could I only could say I haven't tried it. I like the idea
[02:13:49.200 --> 02:13:51.840]   It looks pretty snazzy
[02:13:52.400 --> 02:13:56.960]   Um, it is around.co and I have signed up and look you get a little round
[02:13:56.960 --> 02:14:01.920]   Dot with nothing else around there, which means we're looking for we where we now
[02:14:01.920 --> 02:14:04.400]   Google has been very generous with
[02:14:04.400 --> 02:14:10.640]   The features added for hangouts, right? What it's kind of a now stodgy old interface
[02:14:10.640 --> 02:14:15.120]   Yeah, so we're a lot of push in the faculty to go to zoom
[02:14:15.120 --> 02:14:18.000]   And also a stodgy interface
[02:14:18.480 --> 02:14:21.520]   Uh, maybe a little bit better zoom on my phone
[02:14:21.520 --> 02:14:27.200]   I really actually enjoy it because you could it's got the driving modes you can move over to and then it's very easy to
[02:14:27.200 --> 02:14:33.520]   Mute yourself most of our conferences now are zoom, but this looks good. See you become a little round circle ahead
[02:14:33.520 --> 02:14:40.560]   So that you can still get work done. You know, um, it's it's really more like it looks more like the kind of thing
[02:14:40.560 --> 02:14:42.560]   We all need right now, which is ability for a team
[02:14:42.560 --> 02:14:46.000]   To work together even if they aren't physically together
[02:14:46.800 --> 02:14:51.680]   Got it. I'm surprised now. I was there much. Yeah, how much video is there was slack?
[02:14:51.680 --> 02:14:53.520]   None
[02:14:53.520 --> 02:14:55.520]   Oh, they have video calling don't they?
[02:14:55.520 --> 02:15:00.240]   Really? Yeah, okay. It's been a while since I've been on slack. We use slack, but we never use the video calling
[02:15:00.240 --> 02:15:01.600]   We just use the messaging
[02:15:01.600 --> 02:15:06.640]   Yeah, they they just showed that you can integrate it into slack and uh jump right into a meeting from slack
[02:15:06.640 --> 02:15:11.360]   I thought slack had this video. Yeah, but I've never used it. So
[02:15:11.360 --> 02:15:14.320]   I haven't either. Yeah
[02:15:14.320 --> 02:15:15.360]   Uh
[02:15:15.360 --> 02:15:20.960]   I yeah, I feel like zoom is going to have a big bump from uh this uh
[02:15:20.960 --> 02:15:24.560]   COVID crisis a lot of people are going to be using it to work at home. Oh, yeah
[02:15:24.560 --> 02:15:30.240]   Skype is actually on zoom. I tell you that they call it skype a scientist, but it's on zoom
[02:15:30.240 --> 02:15:34.560]   Yeah, they started with a while back. Yeah, I know that's what I was like. Oh wait
[02:15:34.560 --> 02:15:37.280]   That's pretty funny
[02:15:37.280 --> 02:15:40.960]   Stacy Hicken by the go have what was it you're you're having meatballs
[02:15:40.960 --> 02:15:42.560]   Meatballs
[02:15:42.560 --> 02:15:44.560]   with lingamary sauce
[02:15:44.720 --> 02:15:46.720]   No, no, no, not idea balls
[02:15:46.720 --> 02:15:51.680]   So I can because you know, I've got to make things that I can freeze so we can pull stuff out
[02:15:51.680 --> 02:15:54.000]   When we want to go out to dinner bingo
[02:15:54.000 --> 02:15:58.960]   I have frozen. I made a giant batch of spaghetti sauce on monday and a giant batch of
[02:15:58.960 --> 02:16:01.760]   black bean chili vegetarian chili
[02:16:01.760 --> 02:16:05.120]   And I froze tons of it. So yeah, exactly
[02:16:05.120 --> 02:16:10.080]   Is Lisa still doing the keto thing or is she normal now? Uh, she's a mix
[02:16:10.080 --> 02:16:12.960]   Is ice cream on keto?
[02:16:13.200 --> 02:16:15.200]   No, okay
[02:16:15.200 --> 02:16:17.520]   She's a mix
[02:16:17.520 --> 02:16:21.760]   She's not full-time keto. She always said to me you shouldn't be full-time. Just do it a few days a week
[02:16:21.760 --> 02:16:24.960]   I said so so so black bean chili be okay
[02:16:24.960 --> 02:16:30.640]   No, it would be but I don't think she likes beans. She money beans. That's the that's the crisis with face

[02:16:46.560 --> 02:16:51.840]   I kind of idea must have been the middle of the night. I was probably looking at instagram to make my own tortillas
[02:16:51.840 --> 02:16:54.000]   So I ordered a 20 pound bag of corn
