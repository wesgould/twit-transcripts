[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   Jeff Jarvis at a media conference in Austin, Texas. Hello Jeff.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   Hello, hello. How are you?
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   I am well. How are you?
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   Good.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   Good. I saw Padra. I saw Padra is back.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   Temporarily he's visiting Rome.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   Yeah, that's great.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   Well, he's going back in a week or two to Rome.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   But yeah, it was nice to have him on Twitch.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   It's always great to have Father Robert.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   That's great.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   Just as he was at DEF CON, the hacker convention, he brought the DEF CON badge, which was very cool.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   We talked about it on Twitch this week.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. We got to come back to that.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   The Padra at DEF CON, we got to hear more about that.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   I know, isn't that funny?
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   Also, you're Stacy Higginbotham from StacyOnIOT.com.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   Hello.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   She remembers so fondly those days at GigaOM.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   She has not changed her Twitter handle.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   She's still @GigaStacy.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   Why would you want to change your Twitter handle?
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   It's done.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   It's done.
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   It's cooked no matter what.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   She was kind of getting three jobs ago and still doesn't matter.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   I could be Yada Stacy now because there's even more data.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   Yada Stacy.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   Yada Stacy.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   Yada Stacy.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   No, Petta Stacy.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   Not good.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   Matthew Ingram is also here.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   He's just @MatthewI on the Twitter, former gigaOM alumna.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Actually, you're always an alumna of gigaOM.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   He's currently Chief Digital Writer at the Columbia Journalism Review.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   Hi, Matthew.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   Hi.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   Good to see you.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:07.240]   So Stacy, you, given an opportunity and Google has been pretty, you know, forthright about
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:13.000]   this new Pixel 4 phone, which they probably will announce in the next, probably in October.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.600]   We've seen leaks of the back and the front Google themselves have published a picture of
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.160]   the back.
[00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:28.520]   We've heard a lot about the solely engine, the new cameras, and you decided to take this
[00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.000]   week and buy a Pixel 3A.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   What the what?
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   Yes.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   I know.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.400]   But okay, hear me out.
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.040]   I have really good reasons.
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.800]   And I think there are a lot of other people are going to have these reasons.
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:43.800]   And it's not just to make Carsten feel better and like get on the Carsten tree.
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.800]   Why would it make Carsten feel better?
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.600]   He told me he wanted to like get people to buy the 3A.
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:49.600]   You have a 3A?
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:50.600]   I love the 3A.
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:51.600]   It's an awesome phone.
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:52.600]   Everyone should buy one.
[00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:53.600]   I agree.
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:54.600]   What?
[00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:55.600]   Yeah, see?
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:56.600]   Yeah.
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:57.600]   Whoa.
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.080]   So here's my logic because and this is important when I went on to buy it today.
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.080]   The 3A costs $3.99.
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.080]   Pretty good price.
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:05.080]   And there are no discounts.
[00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.080]   It's a good price for a really good phone.
[00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:09.080]   It has night sight.
[00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:13.640]   It's all the things that I love and want and currently have on my Pixel 2.
[00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:14.640]   And I'm graduating from that.
[00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.320]   It's a good upgrade to the Pixel 2.
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:17.320]   I agree.
[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:18.320]   Yeah.
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:19.880]   And you're giving your daughter the Pixel 2?
[00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.560]   She gets the Pixel 2.
[00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.440]   But the three just the Pixel 3 and the Pixel 3 XL are on sale.
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.040]   So the Pixel 3 was $4.99.
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.560]   So I sat there looking at the two phones and I'm like.
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.360]   Yeah, they're $300 off right now.
[00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.360]   Yeah.
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.880]   But I didn't see a reason to pay a hundred bucks more for a phone.
[00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:44.720]   And part of it is this phone is really good.
[00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:45.920]   Like I love my 2A.
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:50.840]   It takes great photos, which is the biggest thing I probably ask of my phone right now.
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:56.400]   And when I look at the 4 because I know I was thinking about sticking around for that because
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.760]   I wanted to try solely.
[00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:05.280]   But the Google Nest Hub Max, so many words in such a random order.
[00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.960]   It's going to have projects solely in it.
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:10.600]   So now I can try it on a smartphone device, which is actually where it belongs.
[00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.520]   Yeah, because that's all my logic.
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:13.520]   We talked about that last week.
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.920]   gestures make a lot more sense on a device is sitting on a counter than they do with
[00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.400]   your phone right here.
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.400]   All right.
[00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:20.400]   Yes.
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:21.400]   Are you using Fi?
[00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.160]   What are you using for the carrier?
[00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:24.440]   I actually use Verizon.
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:25.440]   I don't use Fi.
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:26.440]   Okay.
[00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:27.440]   Jeff, you're a Fi guy.
[00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.440]   I'm a half Fi guy.
[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:30.440]   Half Fi guy.
[00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:31.440]   Pretty high profile.
[00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:34.240]   My international phone is Fi.
[00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.800]   This phone is AT&T.
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.000]   Pretty fly for a Fi guy.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.200]   I like him, Matthew.
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.000]   I like him.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.800]   So I recently resurrected my because I've been kind of going on a Samsung kick and just
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.880]   got the Note 10 plus and stuff.
[00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:57.400]   But they pushed out an update to the beta of Android 10, which is now the official name
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.320]   on the Pixel 3 XL.
[00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:01.320]   And it actually fixed.
[00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:03.840]   I was having problems with the betas, but this has been very stable.
[00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:04.840]   I think we're getting close.
[00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:07.080]   In fact, rumor has it.
[00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:11.200]   September 3rd, we will get the final version of Android 10.
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.880]   At least that's the smart money is betting on that.
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:15.440]   And I have to say, this is a great phone.
[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:18.240]   I'm looking forward to the Pixel 4 though.
[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:23.000]   I will buy it as well as the new iPhone 11 Pro or whatever they call it as well as
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   you know.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   This is one by Pixelbook.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:27.440]   But you buy everything.
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:29.360]   I have to for review purposes.
[00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.520]   So I don't, you know, I mean, you know, I got a budget to do that.
[00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.200]   That's part of the deal.
[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:36.720]   Should I give my Huawei P20?
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.560]   No, that's a darn good phone.
[00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:41.920]   Oh, Kirsten, right on the car.
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:44.360]   It says, no, it's a darn good phone.
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:46.240]   The P20, I have a P20 somewhere.
[00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:47.800]   It has a great camera.
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:49.040]   It's a little out of date now.
[00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:50.040]   The cameras.
[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.680]   More recent cameras are good.
[00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:55.120]   I have to say though, any modern phone is going to have a pretty good camera.
[00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.120]   The Note 10.
[00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:58.120]   Yeah, you're excellent.
[00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:59.520]   Any good phone, any modern phone.
[00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:02.960]   I'm curious, really curious what Google is going to do with the cameras and the Pixel
[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:03.960]   4.
[00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:05.880]   I want to wait and see what happens.
[00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:09.080]   Like, does the Huawei just stop updating suddenly?
[00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:10.640]   Do Google Apps disappear?
[00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:12.760]   And then I can't reinstall them.
[00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:14.000]   What's going to happen?
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.440]   Oh, good question.
[00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:21.960]   Well, aren't there, isn't Huawei in purgatory right now or is it limbo?
[00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:22.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:23.960]   Yeah.
[00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:31.640]   Google says the Mate 30 can't be sold with licensed Android or licensed Google Apps.
[00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:35.520]   So the newer Huawei phone, and Huawei, by the way, says, it's okay.
[00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:39.080]   We're ready with our own operating system.
[00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:41.080]   But who would want that if you have a choice?
[00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:42.680]   Well, if you're in China, maybe you would.
[00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:47.600]   But it's real time, you know, live backup to China.
[00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:48.600]   China, yeah.
[00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:49.600]   To China.
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:50.600]   Yeah.
[00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:51.600]   To China.
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:52.600]   So all your files are kept safe.
[00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:56.680]   If you lose your phone, you can petition the government for all of them back.
[00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:58.320]   We make that joke about the NSA.
[00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:59.680]   We've been doing that for years.
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:05.200]   So, you know, nice to have two governments backing your data up.
[00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:09.200]   I think that's going to be a very interesting fall.
[00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:10.920]   There's really good phones out there.
[00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:17.080]   And you know, there isn't anything I think Stacy honestly is perfectly reasonable, especially
[00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:20.320]   at that price to get a 3A because there isn't going to be anything that's going to make
[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:21.320]   you go, oh, God.
[00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:25.600]   So, isn't that the problem with the phone market right now?
[00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:29.280]   Like there's lots of the phones that people have that are more interesting.
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:31.080]   Even two generations.
[00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:32.880]   Yeah, there's still great phones.
[00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:33.880]   Yeah.
[00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:35.880]   And there's nothing really.
[00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:36.880]   Wait a minute.
[00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:37.880]   Wait a minute.
[00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:38.880]   I think.
[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:45.320]   I thought maybe it was quite the sad, Jeff.
[00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:47.320]   What is your descent?
[00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:50.680]   I think you could make Stacy feel really awful if you want to do this.
[00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:51.680]   I don't.
[00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:52.680]   That's the problem.
[00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:53.680]   You're right.
[00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:54.680]   I could.
[00:08:54.680 --> 00:09:01.440]   Just because Stacy, more than anyone, anyone, period, I know who understands and doesn't
[00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:03.640]   make fun of gestures.
[00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:08.000]   I want to see you playing with gestures on a Pixel 4.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.040]   You can see me playing with it on a hub.
[00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:15.240]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, because we make fun of you with the phone and all
[00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:16.240]   this.
[00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:18.160]   And you've got to say, no, Jeff, you're full of crap.
[00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:19.480]   Let me show you.
[00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:23.240]   I think you should be that person.
[00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:25.360]   This is, I don't believe in it on a phone.
[00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:30.400]   But if Leo, you want to send me the Pixel 4, then I will have a gesture.
[00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:36.960]   I have gestures in the Note 10 Plus because that stylus has, in fact, the very first part
[00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:41.000]   of the onboarding with the Note 10 Plus is they say, okay, now take out the stylus, press
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.400]   the button and do some, and you go clockwise, counterclockwise, tap.
[00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:46.920]   And use it once it's done.
[00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:48.840]   And that, no, that's it.
[00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:55.480]   I'm not sure if you can, but you can have, I saw an ad, I saw an ad where you could have
[00:09:55.480 --> 00:09:58.280]   a presentation on your Note 10 Plus.
[00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:02.800]   And while you're showing the client who's got to, of course, get very close to your
[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:08.720]   phone to see this presentation and you can just swipe in the air with your pen and go
[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:10.720]   to the next slide, next slide.
[00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:16.720]   I don't want to be, you know, Debbie downer, but are that many people really going to do
[00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:17.720]   gestures?
[00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:18.720]   I mean, maybe I'm wrong.
[00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:19.720]   Maybe not.
[00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:20.720]   On the phone.
[00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:23.400]   That's why I'm like, eh, just don't see it.
[00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:24.960]   I do see, I do see.
[00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:31.440]   And I think you're right, Stacy, in the kitchen where your hub max will be, I do see the idea
[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:35.600]   that, you know, you're, you've got your hands, your flipping, or you're going like that,
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:38.640]   or you're going to stop or I could see that.
[00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:39.640]   I can see that.
[00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:42.400]   I mean, we can do this works well for that too, right?
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:44.040]   We need a minority report thing.
[00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:47.520]   We have to put on a glove and then you can like, you know, like.
[00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:49.520]   I'll make labs had that.
[00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:50.520]   Nope.
[00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:53.320]   They had that four-arm thing that actually did exactly that.
[00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:54.840]   Oh, it was rubber suit.
[00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:55.840]   Yeah.
[00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:57.520]   And don't talk about my rubber suit.
[00:10:57.520 --> 00:10:59.400]   Those are the battle.
[00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:04.480]   We had, there was an Apple had a magic leap device that you put in front of your screen
[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:07.480]   and you could gesture and I never, it never caught on.
[00:11:07.480 --> 00:11:08.840]   Nobody was really that interested in it.
[00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:09.840]   Oh, I think that.
[00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:12.320]   So somebody in the chat room did mention driving.
[00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:14.720]   It could be, I could see it being useful for that.
[00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:15.720]   Oh, that's a good one.
[00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:17.200]   You know, young man.
[00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:20.040]   Ways has used that for some time.
[00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:25.000]   You know, one of the problems with ways is they want you to report hazards, police in
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.840]   the road, whatever, but you can't really do it without fiddling with the phone except
[00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:33.680]   they do have, I don't doubt anybody uses it, but they have a gesture.
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:35.220]   You could really, yeah, you can wave your.
[00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:36.220]   And they've had that for years.
[00:11:36.220 --> 00:11:39.620]   You wave your hand over the phone and it says, oh, what would you like to report?
[00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:40.620]   Yeah.
[00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:42.720]   Well, you have to be open to the phone?
[00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:43.720]   What?
[00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:45.400]   Is it running up or?
[00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:47.440]   Yeah, I can't remember what the gesture was.
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:49.680]   Ways is running in your phone, right?
[00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:51.400]   Because you're using it, right?
[00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:52.400]   Okay.
[00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:57.360]   And then if in there, and maybe they've taken it out since, but I've used it at least two
[00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:59.040]   or three years ago, the gestures.
[00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:00.400]   It turned out or something or?
[00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:01.800]   Yeah, it's in the settings.
[00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:05.760]   Let me see if I can find it.
[00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:09.560]   I can never, you know, I can never use the ways interface.
[00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:10.920]   I don't know what it's not.
[00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:11.920]   It's not the whole.
[00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:12.920]   It's 24 hours.
[00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:13.920]   No, no, what to tap here.
[00:12:13.920 --> 00:12:16.840]   I always end up tapping carpool and I don't know.
[00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:18.320]   I don't want to carpool.
[00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:19.320]   I don't.
[00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:26.440]   So that no, I don't know what to tap in here to start the select vehicle type.
[00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:29.960]   We need a UX show just for stuff like this.
[00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:31.440]   Although so.
[00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:36.680]   I will say to you guys, and I don't know if you want to talk about this because it is
[00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:38.680]   not Google related at all.
[00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:41.680]   But last week on Thursday, I was a better father.
[00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:44.680]   Yeah, that's actually the first thing.
[00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:46.960]   I've heard this show Stacey.
[00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:50.040]   I tried to stick to the Google.
[00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:52.040]   Sorry, go ahead.
[00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:54.960]   I tried on the Microsoft HoloLens 2.
[00:12:54.960 --> 00:13:00.440]   And if you want to see Stacey running around doing strange gestures, that is part of it
[00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:02.400]   was getting used to like the gestures.
[00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:08.800]   And the HoloLens 2 is actually really amazing compared to the HoloLens 1 and other VR experience,
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:11.160]   sorry, AR experiences I've had.
[00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:15.000]   They also have eye tracking.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   So when I looked at things, I could click, you know, I click.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.280]   I don't know what's the word for that.
[00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:24.200]   I could look at something and I didn't need to blink.
[00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:25.200]   I just looked at it.
[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:29.600]   And if I looked at it for long enough, it would like go to the next slide.
[00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:31.640]   So the word next is there.
[00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:34.440]   I would look at it and it would go.
[00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:35.920]   It was pretty cool.
[00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:41.120]   Although I was very focused and I got so focused trying to like, I am looking at you
[00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:44.400]   and I started getting a headache.
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:46.400]   So I had to stop.
[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:53.680]   Someone pointed out that you running around doing strange gestures would make a very successful
[00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:54.680]   YouTube channel.
[00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:58.240]   So you're thinking of branching out.
[00:13:58.240 --> 00:13:59.240]   IoT ballet.
[00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:00.240]   I know.
[00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:01.240]   Okay.
[00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:02.240]   Yeah.
[00:14:02.240 --> 00:14:03.240]   Well, I don't know about that.
[00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:05.600]   My funny gestures are pretty.
[00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:07.600]   Learning gestures with Stacey.
[00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:12.320]   I mean, it was very, it was very intuitive and they have this beautiful little bird that
[00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:16.960]   will fly to your hand and hangs out there and you're like, hello bird.
[00:14:16.960 --> 00:14:18.360]   Oh, it's kind of weird though.
[00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:20.360]   And it doesn't land quite right, right?
[00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:21.360]   No, it doesn't.
[00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:22.360]   Yeah.
[00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:26.400]   And if you look at it too long and explode, it feels very primitive to me.
[00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:29.760]   But no, I understand the benefit of it.
[00:14:29.760 --> 00:14:30.760]   Of course it's primitive.
[00:14:30.760 --> 00:14:32.760]   These gestures are anyway.
[00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:34.760]   Go ahead, Stacey.
[00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:40.120]   So those gestures, although I did, like if I looked at, they had a thing where if I looked
[00:14:40.120 --> 00:14:43.520]   at something and I said, explode, the thing would explode.
[00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:44.520]   That's pretty cool.
[00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:46.080]   If it was a bird.
[00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:48.520]   And also if I went, not the bird, it was gems.
[00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:49.520]   Okay.
[00:14:49.520 --> 00:14:50.920]   There was no exploding birds.
[00:14:50.920 --> 00:14:51.920]   Oh, Jim's.
[00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:52.920]   Wait a minute.
[00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:53.920]   Exploding Jim's.
[00:14:53.920 --> 00:14:55.480]   Is that JIM or Jim?
[00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:57.240]   No, no, J or sorry.
[00:14:57.240 --> 00:14:58.240]   G.
[00:14:58.240 --> 00:15:00.200]   Oh, Jim's exploding Jim's stones.
[00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:01.200]   How about Jim?
[00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:02.200]   Oh, just keep it.
[00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:03.200]   Okay.
[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:04.920]   Jim, like exploding gems.
[00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:11.440]   Yeah, it was the same thing you used to calibrate is you would watch them and then afterwards.
[00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:14.320]   And there's some amazing silicon firepower in there.
[00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:15.320]   Oh my God.
[00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:17.720]   Oh, you're such a geek.
[00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:19.240]   Oh, I know.
[00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:24.600]   But it was, I mean, like the processor they built for this is pretty awesome.
[00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:28.000]   I am going to write about it for sure because I am still.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   Arm chip.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   Arm chip.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   It is.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.720]   I don't know the architecture actually.
[00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:34.000]   I feel like they did their own.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.280]   It was a okay.
[00:15:36.280 --> 00:15:40.160]   Don't ask me these questions yet because I'm still writing and until I finish writing,
[00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:42.680]   I won't have all the words in my brain.
[00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:44.520]   But I will come back to you and tell you about it.
[00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:45.520]   Okay.
[00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:50.960]   I got to say, exploding gems would also be pretty cool.
[00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:58.000]   It is going to be not Android quince pie, Android quince jelly, Android.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:15:59.280]   It's going to be Android 10.
[00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:01.360]   There's they're dumping the desserts.
[00:16:01.360 --> 00:16:06.840]   I have a little regret on that, but I think Google's absolutely correct that that was
[00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:09.600]   a dopey idea and it didn't work globally.
[00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:10.600]   It was cute.
[00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:11.600]   Come on.
[00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:12.600]   It was cute.
[00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:16.480]   And you know, it was cute was that unveiling of the statue on the Googleplex.
[00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:19.040]   But the fun is that between topia cute.
[00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:20.560]   They're now.
[00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:21.800]   They're all falling apart.
[00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:23.200]   Oh, are they really?
[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:24.920]   It is like a terrible.
[00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:26.880]   Old amusement park.
[00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:27.880]   A bad amusement park.
[00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:28.880]   A bad amusement park.
[00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:31.680]   Five nights at Freddy's.
[00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:33.680]   Oh, that's depressing.
[00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:38.400]   Why didn't they build them to I guess they just didn't care to build them to last?
[00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:39.400]   Technology's changing.
[00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:41.400]   Oh, there will have to be fiberglass.
[00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:42.400]   Yeah.
[00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:43.400]   Oh, yes.
[00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:44.400]   Okay.
[00:16:44.400 --> 00:16:45.400]   It's a road.
[00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:46.400]   Wow.
[00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:47.400]   I wonder if this is.
[00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:49.400]   They should turn it into a putt putt course.
[00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:51.040]   I don't want to.
[00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:52.760]   Putt putt course.
[00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:53.760]   That's perfect.
[00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:58.840]   If I was writing a hot take, if I was still in the hot take business, I would be writing
[00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:06.360]   about how this is a perfect example of how Google used to be fun and is now boring.
[00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:08.680]   And I liked it a lot better when it was fun.
[00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:11.720]   Yeah, the stick of the lollipop is rusty.
[00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:12.720]   There's cupcake.
[00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:14.720]   There's ice cream sandwich.
[00:17:14.720 --> 00:17:15.720]   Looks fine.
[00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:16.720]   Eclair gingerbread.
[00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:17.720]   No, up close.
[00:17:17.720 --> 00:17:18.720]   I'm close.
[00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:20.720]   They don't look so good.
[00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:21.720]   No.
[00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:23.720]   You know, a little ratty.
[00:17:23.720 --> 00:17:28.360]   It really does look like an abandoned amusement park.
[00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:34.680]   A roadside attraction that's seen better days, you know, ice cream sundae.
[00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:35.680]   Yeah.
[00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:36.680]   So that's it.
[00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:37.680]   Honeycomb.
[00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:38.680]   Honeycomb.
[00:17:38.680 --> 00:17:39.680]   Yeah.
[00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:40.680]   That was the tablet.
[00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:44.440]   Oh, that was only briefly used.
[00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:45.440]   Kit Kat.
[00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:50.280]   So Android 10 is just going to be a big number 10.
[00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:51.280]   Just a 10.
[00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:52.280]   And I think that's the way it should be.
[00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:53.280]   Oring.
[00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:54.280]   What is it with a number 10?
[00:17:54.280 --> 00:17:55.280]   Well, at least it's not a big X.
[00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:56.280]   Mac OS 10.
[00:17:56.280 --> 00:17:58.760]   Windows 10.
[00:17:58.760 --> 00:17:59.760]   iPhone 10s.
[00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:01.560]   Note 10.
[00:18:01.560 --> 00:18:03.200]   Note 10.
[00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:04.200]   And now Android 10.
[00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:05.200]   565G.
[00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:07.680]   Don't give me counter examples.
[00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:11.960]   I'm on a roll.
[00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:16.520]   I think I've come up with enough 10s to say that there seems to be in the tech industry
[00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:19.680]   a affinity for 10 or is it just by accident?
[00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:21.240]   It's big round numbers, my friend.
[00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:22.240]   Big round numbers.
[00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:24.240]   And no one wants to go to 11.
[00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:26.240]   It's not as evil.
[00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:29.040]   It's final tap once it goes to 11.
[00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:30.040]   It goes to 11.
[00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:31.040]   Yeah, come on.
[00:18:31.040 --> 00:18:34.960]   But yeah, actually, if you think about it, knobs, volume knobs, pre-spinal drop.
[00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:36.800]   Android goes to 11.
[00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:38.800]   Oh, then that becomes a joke.
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:43.440]   I think still most knobs stop at 10, don't they?
[00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:47.120]   There's a show title for you.
[00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:48.720]   Completely ambiguous.
[00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:51.320]   We are actually already 10 minutes in.
[00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:56.320]   We are going to 11.
[00:18:56.320 --> 00:19:01.320]   Complete with show titles, including "Pretty Fly for a Fly Guy" and "Exploding Gems."
[00:19:01.320 --> 00:19:02.320]   Nice.
[00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:04.320]   I think we should just stop now.
[00:19:04.320 --> 00:19:10.080]   Someone pointed out that Twig could stand for this week in interactive gestures with
[00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:11.080]   Stacey Higginboth.
[00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:16.520]   Oh, they're not interactive if I can't see anyone else though, right?
[00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:18.000]   You could just stand there.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.320]   It'd be kind of like watching "Sinkron Ice Swimming."
[00:19:20.320 --> 00:19:21.320]   Yeah.
[00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:24.320]   Strike a pose.
[00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:25.320]   Vogue.
[00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:28.040]   I'm going to have to work on my poses.
[00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:29.240]   I'll get on that.
[00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:31.800]   I think this is the new thing, yeah.
[00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:35.400]   Which beats the new show we came up with for Paul Thorett earlier today, which is Day
[00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:36.400]   Drinking with Paul.
[00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:38.400]   Oh, I like that show idea.
[00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:39.400]   That'd be good.
[00:19:39.400 --> 00:19:40.400]   I'd watch that.
[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:43.280]   There's a couple of those on YouTube already.
[00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:44.280]   Yeah, Day Drinking.
[00:19:44.280 --> 00:19:45.280]   Yeah.
[00:19:45.280 --> 00:19:46.800]   It's the new Day Drinking in Mukbang.
[00:19:46.800 --> 00:19:48.000]   Day Drinking Mukbang.
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:51.800]   So there's nothing much more to say about Android 10, except that's it.
[00:19:51.800 --> 00:20:01.720]   As I said, the rumor, and this comes from pretty flimsy sources, not as flimsy as the
[00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:09.040]   sources on MSNBC last night, but flimsy sources that September 3rd will be the—no, it wasn't
[00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:10.760]   Lauren Sordano.
[00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:15.680]   November 3rd will be the—or September 3rd will be the Day, which would make sense for
[00:20:15.680 --> 00:20:22.920]   Android 10, which means if you have your Pixel 3A or your Pixel XL or an essential phone,
[00:20:22.920 --> 00:20:29.120]   a number of other phones, you can just update and you'll have the latest, greatest new OS.
[00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:30.520]   Enough to say about that.
[00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:34.960]   I think we should defer to the all about Android folks for the rest of them.
[00:20:34.960 --> 00:20:37.640]   How about this for you, Jeff Jarvis and I.
[00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:42.080]   We've got to get Kevin Tofo's take on this, but Google has a new Chromebook.
[00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:43.080]   Sort of.
[00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:44.080]   Yeah.
[00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:45.080]   Yeah.
[00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:53.800]   So it's time to make enterprise grade Chromebooks based on the Dell Latitude 5300 and 5400.
[00:20:53.800 --> 00:21:00.160]   And when I say enterprise, I mean these things are loaded 13 and 14 inch screens respectively,
[00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:11.720]   1080p, up to 32 gigs of DDR4 RAM, up to a terabyte of enterprise class SSDs, LTE radios.
[00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:12.720]   Ooh.
[00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:14.360]   Yeah.
[00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:16.440]   Now they're not very attractive.
[00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:24.680]   These are the laptops you get from work that nobody ever got real excited about, but hey,
[00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:27.840]   it'll be pretty robust.
[00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:28.840]   What do you think?
[00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:29.840]   Maybe that's true.
[00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:30.840]   I think it's a good idea.
[00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:32.080]   I think going with Dell was a good idea.
[00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:35.880]   They're trying to push this beyond education into enterprises.
[00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:40.480]   By the way, I'm pretty sure if you watch succession that they use Chromebooks.
[00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:41.480]   Yeah.
[00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:42.480]   It's like a Chromebook.
[00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:43.480]   Yeah.
[00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:45.800]   But billions is a much better show.
[00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:47.360]   I've never gotten a succession.
[00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:48.360]   Oh, I love succession.
[00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:53.000]   In fact, season two, it's the worst family in the world.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   Yeah.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   A little bit.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   The sea.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   Good.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   I don't know.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   Oh, come on.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.720]   And Romans like put downs, there's a hole.
[00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:03.680]   There's a hole now thing.
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:06.360]   Apparently, he's encouraged to ad lib.
[00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:12.200]   And the actor said I had to go around and apologize because I would go off on extras
[00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:14.520]   on the set.
[00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:16.680]   And I had to afterwards say, you know, that's not me.
[00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:17.680]   That's Roman.
[00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:21.400]   It's not me.
[00:22:21.400 --> 00:22:22.400]   So back to Dell.
[00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:23.400]   All right.
[00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:26.120]   So you think they're using Chromebooks, even though they're the richest people.
[00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:27.120]   Huh?
[00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:29.720]   But I think you make an interesting point about the kind of look of them, the Dell look of
[00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:30.720]   them.
[00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:32.640]   So I'm Jeff's book of the day.
[00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:38.360]   I'm reading an unbelievably fascinating book that you would, if you saw this title, you
[00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:41.200]   would never, never imagine.
[00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:44.720]   You'd want to read it for more than two pages.
[00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:47.680]   Track changes, a literary history of word processing.
[00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:49.240]   Oh my God.
[00:22:49.240 --> 00:22:52.440]   And even the typeface is horrific.
[00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:53.440]   Wow.
[00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:54.440]   It's brilliant.
[00:22:54.440 --> 00:22:55.440]   It's wonderful.
[00:22:55.440 --> 00:22:57.080]   It's just like, I can't wait to read it.
[00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:59.200]   It's back to the earliest word.
[00:22:59.200 --> 00:23:00.200]   It's from 2016.
[00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:02.400]   I found it in a used bookstore in Palo Alto.
[00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:03.400]   Oh, it's out.
[00:23:03.400 --> 00:23:07.400]   And oh, it's a Harvard Belnet book.
[00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:10.640]   But it's, it's, I doubt it'll be unaudible.
[00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:11.640]   No.
[00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:15.240]   You're going to have to read this one with your eyes.
[00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:20.120]   And then I hit control K S and my life changed.
[00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:25.360]   Well, yeah, I went through, I found the old word star manual so I can put it in examples.
[00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:26.360]   I'm writing something now.
[00:23:26.360 --> 00:23:28.000]   That's going to remember Elaine about all this.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   Yeah.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.760]   But it goes back to.
[00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:34.240]   What's the first word processor?
[00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:37.040]   Well, there's a debate about that.
[00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:40.320]   There's, there's the IBM X, what was it called?
[00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:42.920]   There was dedicated word processors like the Wang.
[00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:43.920]   Oh, yeah.
[00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:44.920]   All that.
[00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:47.000]   But with the first micro word processor, was it electric pencil?
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:51.040]   I feel like that might have been the first one on micros.
[00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:55.120]   Probably there was also the IBM MTS T.
[00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:56.880]   Wow.
[00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:59.680]   And this they marketed as a $10,000 thing.
[00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:00.680]   This has been a year.
[00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:01.680]   So that was a standalone.
[00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:02.680]   70s.
[00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:03.680]   Yeah.
[00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:04.680]   Oh, yeah.
[00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:05.680]   Oh, yeah.
[00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:06.680]   Oh, yeah.
[00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:07.880]   Len Dayton had one moved into his house and had a crane moving into his house.
[00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:08.880]   Oh my God.
[00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:09.880]   Wait a minute.
[00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:13.080]   This IBM Selectric built into its own desk.
[00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:14.080]   Yes.
[00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:15.080]   Wow.
[00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:18.600]   It had magnetic tape recording and playback facilities.
[00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:22.440]   That's the only way you could edit is you play back the tape.
[00:24:22.440 --> 00:24:25.640]   Oh, this is it had automated word wrap.
[00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:27.880]   There was no screen.
[00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:29.880]   No, none.
[00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:36.040]   Oh, so they talked in the book about how you had to think like a tape.
[00:24:36.040 --> 00:24:42.200]   It looked like a mechanics relays continuous string of characters.
[00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:45.080]   And then when you wanted to insert something or read something, you had to go back to that
[00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:51.080]   point with a printer and book and stop and then you were editing the tape this way.
[00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:53.120]   This is how you had to think.
[00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:54.120]   Very McClellan.
[00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:55.120]   All right.
[00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:56.120]   This I've got to find out.
[00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:59.320]   This is we're going to be working for this here looking for this.
[00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:01.960]   Jim Henson in 1964.
[00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:02.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:03.960]   There's a bad.
[00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:05.600]   There's an ad for it.
[00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:06.600]   You ready?
[00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:07.600]   Here we go.
[00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:08.600]   It's called this.
[00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:09.600]   Yes.
[00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:11.920]   Jim Henson Muppet guy before he was Muppet guy.
[00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:13.400]   This is the IBM.
[00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:22.280]   I don't believe we'll get taken down for showing this.
[00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:23.560]   What this is wild.
[00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:25.560]   This is a.
[00:25:25.560 --> 00:25:27.240]   Henson must have been on acid.
[00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:28.240]   This is in the 60s.
[00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:32.680]   This is some dark crystal stuff right here.
[00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:34.680]   Wow.
[00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:36.680]   Your pen stopped.
[00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:39.680]   There's a train.
[00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:42.680]   There's a jet.
[00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:50.600]   IBM work is related to the paperwork explosion.
[00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:57.400]   The paperwork is specifically the paperwork in an office.
[00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:58.400]   This is Jim Henson.
[00:25:58.400 --> 00:25:59.400]   This is great.
[00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:00.400]   I don't see it.
[00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:03.160]   These are these new phones Muppets.
[00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:04.840]   I'm sorry I can't hear you.
[00:26:04.840 --> 00:26:07.200]   I can see all of these people as Muppets.
[00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:08.200]   Yes.
[00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:09.200]   It was Stadler.
[00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:10.200]   Yes.
[00:26:10.200 --> 00:26:11.200]   That was Stadler.
[00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:12.200]   Wow.
[00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:13.200]   I'm just, I'm so loud.
[00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:14.200]   I can't.
[00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:15.200]   Paperwork explosion.
[00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:17.200]   There's always been a lot of paperwork in an office.
[00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:18.200]   That's a Muppet.
[00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:20.200]   But today there's more than ever before.
[00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:22.200]   There's more than ever before.
[00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:24.200]   Oh, that's the former FBI director.
[00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:25.200]   That's Stadler.
[00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:26.200]   This is Stadler.
[00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:27.200]   This is Stadler.
[00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:33.200]   There's more than ever before.
[00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:34.200]   That is Stadler.
[00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:37.200]   There's always seemed to be enough time and people to do the paperwork.
[00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:39.200]   There always seemed to be enough time.
[00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:41.200]   Can you imagine seeing this in 1964?
[00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:42.200]   This is so creepy.
[00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:44.200]   It's like clap of course.
[00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:50.920]   There always seemed to be enough time and people to do the paperwork.
[00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:51.920]   This is so.
[00:26:51.920 --> 00:26:52.920]   There isn't.
[00:26:52.920 --> 00:26:55.200]   Today there isn't enough time.
[00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:56.200]   Off on car.
[00:26:56.200 --> 00:26:59.200]   There aren't enough people.
[00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:01.200]   Rocket launching.
[00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:04.200]   40th moment.
[00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:11.200]   Cars, helicopters, big office buildings, trains, planes, satellite.
[00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:15.200]   Everyone has to spend more time on paperwork.
[00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:18.200]   Management has to spend more time on paperwork.
[00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:21.200]   Secretaries have to spend more time on paperwork.
[00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:26.200]   This is free for.
[00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:27.200]   Engineers.
[00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:31.200]   I feel like I took the brown ass.
[00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:36.200]   This is five years before wood starts.
[00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:39.200]   This is the Kingston Trio era.
[00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:44.200]   Everybody has to spend more time on paperwork.
[00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:47.200]   Again, the exploding paperwork.
[00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:48.200]   Is there a point?
[00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:50.200]   We haven't seen the MT yet.
[00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:52.200]   We have to get a new small door figure.
[00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:54.200]   Or a statler.
[00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:57.200]   Seems to me we could use some help.
[00:27:57.200 --> 00:28:00.200]   When are we going to see the idea?
[00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:04.200]   The portless ticket unit.
[00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:08.200]   The portless ticket unit can type 150 worth, and it's ever free.
[00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:11.200]   The IBM office products division representative.
[00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:13.200]   The book's on bridge.
[00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:16.200]   What do you mean by ever free detention?
[00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:17.200]   Wait a minute.
[00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:20.200]   Is that John Teterra?
[00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:21.200]   The IBM mix.
[00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:22.200]   Call them TST.
[00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:25.200]   It's all a whole line of IBM office products throughout the audience.
[00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:26.200]   They have yet to show it.
[00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:30.200]   IBM can help you with the time it takes to do the paperwork.
[00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:32.200]   I hear the selector typing.
[00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:33.200]   There it is.
[00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:35.200]   Click this thing.
[00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:45.200]   With IBM vacation equipment, I can get four times as much thinking recorded.
[00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:48.200]   So that was one of those dictaphones type things.
[00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:51.200]   Like they have a big band.
[00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:56.200]   The IBM MTST here turns rough draft into air free copy automatically.
[00:28:56.200 --> 00:28:58.200]   At the range of the page.
[00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:01.200]   And it has paper tape and a selector.
[00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:04.200]   These IBM machines can increase people's productivity.
[00:29:04.200 --> 00:29:06.200]   I wonder how many they solve of these.
[00:29:06.200 --> 00:29:13.200]   And for the thinking that requires printed distribution, there's the IBM Selectric Composer.
[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:16.200]   IBM machines can do the work.
[00:29:16.200 --> 00:29:18.200]   So that people have time to think.
[00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:20.200]   Machines should do the work.
[00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:22.200]   That's what their best at.
[00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:24.200]   People should do the thinking.
[00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:26.200]   That's what their best at.
[00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:27.200]   Machines should work.
[00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:29.200]   People should think.
[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:31.200]   Machines should work.
[00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:34.200]   People should think.
[00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:37.200]   This is subversive as dark.
[00:29:37.200 --> 00:29:38.200]   This is dark.
[00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:41.200]   So I don't do much work anymore.
[00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:44.200]   I'm too busy thinking.
[00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:47.200]   I want to know who that guy is.
[00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:49.200]   Oh my God.
[00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:52.200]   How did IBM to pay for that?
[00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:58.200]   So they also, he previously, according to the book, he previously designed a mascot character
[00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:02.200]   for the electric tape radio edition called Rolf, R-O-W-L-F.
[00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:03.200]   Rolf is the five-minute.
[00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:04.200]   Rolf is the dog?
[00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:05.200]   Rolf.
[00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:06.200]   Yeah, Rolf is the dog.
[00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:07.200]   He's the piano player.
[00:30:07.200 --> 00:30:08.200]   He's amazing.
[00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:09.200]   He's amazing.
[00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:13.200]   He's just basically reused his old stuff.
[00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:16.200]   The music was composed by Raymond Scott.
[00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:19.200]   He's deliberately jarring.
[00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:33.200]   So there is, at OpenCulture.com, a whole collection of the surreal 1960s films and commercials of Jim Henson.
[00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:38.200]   I guess he did a lot of stuff like this.
[00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:43.200]   Apparently, IBM, when they hired him, knew what they were getting.
[00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:51.200]   Yeah, if you look up the IBM Muppet Show, so he made a bunch of short films for IBM.
[00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:55.200]   And in fact, he used the Cookie Monster in one of them.
[00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:56.200]   I'm loving it.
[00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:57.200]   I'm just loving it.
[00:30:57.200 --> 00:30:58.200]   No, that's my Donald's.
[00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:00.200]   That's credit where it's due again.
[00:31:00.200 --> 00:31:02.200]   That is wild credit where it's due.
[00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:07.200]   I've discovered that in Track Changes, a literary history of word processing by Matthew Kirschandel.
[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:10.200]   I'm telling you, it's entertaining as hell.
[00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:12.200]   I want to get that, but you can't.
[00:31:12.200 --> 00:31:14.200]   It's probably out of print.
[00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:15.200]   You can go.
[00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:16.200]   You know, bookfinder?
[00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:17.200]   Yes.
[00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:19.200]   That's the best thing there is on the road.
[00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:20.200]   The best thing.
[00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:22.200]   Oh, actually, it's on Amazon.
[00:31:22.200 --> 00:31:26.200]   In hardcover, 21-15.
[00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:27.200]   Yeah.
[00:31:27.200 --> 00:31:29.200]   Oh, I paid 26.
[00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:30.200]   Look at that.
[00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:32.200]   You've got to take it.
[00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:35.200]   Yeah, you should have checked Amazon.
[00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:37.200]   I think you should have it.
[00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:39.200]   I think you should have checked it.
[00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:41.200]   I think you should have checked it.
[00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:43.200]   I think you should have checked it.
[00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:45.200]   I think that's a good thing to see.
[00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:46.200]   Yeah.
[00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:47.200]   I think you should have checked it.
[00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:48.200]   I think you should have checked it.
[00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:50.200]   I think you should have checked it.
[00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:51.200]   I think you should have checked it.
[00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:52.200]   I think you should have checked it.
[00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:53.200]   I think you should have checked it.
[00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:54.200]   I think you should have checked it.
[00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:55.200]   I think you should have checked it.
[00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:56.200]   I think you should have checked it.
[00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:57.200]   I think you should have checked it.
[00:31:57.200 --> 00:31:58.200]   I think you should have checked it.
[00:31:58.200 --> 00:31:59.200]   I think you should have checked it.
[00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:00.200]   I think you should have checked it.
[00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:01.200]   I think you should have checked it.
[00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:02.200]   I think you should have checked it.
[00:32:02.200 --> 00:32:03.200]   I think you should have checked it.
[00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:04.200]   I think you should have checked it.
[00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:05.200]   I think you should have checked it.

[00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:31.200]   I think you should have checked it.
[00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:32.200]   I think you should have checked it.
[00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:33.200]   I think you should have checked it.
[00:37:33.200 --> 00:37:39.200]   Was it a computer literacy class, or was it a typing class that was actually computer literacy?
[00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:40.200]   Oh, interesting.
[00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:45.200]   But I remember it playing Excel.
[00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:47.200]   Here's something you didn't have to--
[00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:49.200]   I'm in love with Stacy's mom.
[00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:51.200]   I hate that song.
[00:37:51.200 --> 00:37:54.200]   Stacy's mom has got it going on.
[00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:57.200]   There's an amazing jazz version of that.
[00:37:57.200 --> 00:37:58.200]   Really?
[00:37:58.200 --> 00:37:59.200]   Bountains of Wayne, isn't it?
[00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:02.200]   Yes, it was one of my favorite grapes of all time.
[00:38:02.200 --> 00:38:04.200]   And a great place to buy some fountains.
[00:38:04.200 --> 00:38:06.200]   It's a great store in Wayne, New Jersey.
[00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:08.200]   Yep, it is.
[00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:09.200]   Yes.
[00:38:09.200 --> 00:38:12.200]   Just outside of Bedminster.
[00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:13.200]   Shall I--
[00:38:13.200 --> 00:38:22.200]   From the word star manual, a dramatic reading of the instructions to move a block of text.
[00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:23.200]   Oh, wait till you hear this, kids.
[00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:24.200]   Oh, okay.
[00:38:24.200 --> 00:38:25.200]   One.
[00:38:25.200 --> 00:38:29.200]   Put cursor-- by the way, I had to explain to people what a cursor was.
[00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:30.200]   It was a whole new concept.
[00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:32.200]   Put cursor on first character.
[00:38:32.200 --> 00:38:35.200]   Type control KB to mark start.
[00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:36.200]   Number two.
[00:38:36.200 --> 00:38:39.200]   Put cursor over last character.
[00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:41.200]   Type control KK to mark end.
[00:38:41.200 --> 00:38:42.200]   Correthisis.
[00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:48.200]   For end line, use start next line to include return.
[00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:52.200]   There are entire philosophy classes trying to parse just that sentence.
[00:38:52.200 --> 00:38:54.200]   No, we have heard people unsubscribing.
[00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:56.200]   No, we have heard people unsubscribing.
[00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:57.200]   No, we have heard people--
[00:38:57.200 --> 00:38:58.200]   Do this, Matthew.
[00:38:58.200 --> 00:39:00.200]   Put cursor at destination.
[00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:05.200]   Type control KB to move the text or control KC to make a duplicate copy.
[00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:06.200]   I remember all these domains.
[00:39:06.200 --> 00:39:10.200]   I'm just way markers afterwards use control KH.
[00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:17.200]   Control KB and control KK may be entered in either order with or without other intervening commands.
[00:39:17.200 --> 00:39:20.200]   All above commands are on the control K menu.
[00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:23.200]   We need a hip-hop, like, track.
[00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:24.200]   Facking.
[00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:26.200]   Now, this is what got me through.
[00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:27.200]   Easy script for the cover.
[00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:32.200]   It's advanced professional word processing.
[00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:33.200]   Professional.
[00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:35.200]   All the way through high script.
[00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:38.200]   You know where the term cursor came from, Jeff?
[00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:41.200]   I'm thinking slide rules.
[00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:43.200]   The first time I heard the word cursor was a slide rule.
[00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:46.200]   It's the name for the little transparent thing.
[00:39:46.200 --> 00:39:47.200]   Oh, I didn't know.
[00:39:47.200 --> 00:39:48.200]   It gets more on the slide rule.
[00:39:48.200 --> 00:39:53.200]   Well, that closes episode of this week in Geezers tuning in next week.
[00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:54.200]   Poor Stacy.
[00:39:54.200 --> 00:39:56.200]   We're going to have Stacy's mom on.
[00:39:56.200 --> 00:40:03.200]   I'm just going to be back here, you know, recollecting the sound of the dot matrix printer.
[00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:08.200]   And that's about it.
[00:40:08.200 --> 00:40:13.200]   What do you think about this Leven Dowsky story?
[00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:14.200]   This is wild.
[00:40:14.200 --> 00:40:19.200]   So we've been talking about this for a long time.
[00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:24.200]   Anthony Leven Dowsky was a star at Google.
[00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:31.200]   He left Google and went to Uber, actually to Auto, right, which is a self-driving truck.
[00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:36.200]   He was at Waymo and went to the self-driving truck company, Auto.
[00:40:36.200 --> 00:40:38.200]   I guess he ended up at Uber.
[00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:40.200]   Google complained at the time, right?
[00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:42.200]   Google complained at the time and sued.
[00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:47.200]   But it's rare that a civil suit turns into a criminal action.
[00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:53.200]   Federal prosecutors yesterday charged Leven Dowsky with 33 counts of theft and attempted theft
[00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:56.200]   and attempted theft of trade secrets from Google.
[00:40:56.200 --> 00:41:01.880]   He was arranged in San Jose, posted $2 million bail and was ordered to wear an ankle monitor
[00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:06.360]   after prosecutors argued he's a flight risk.
[00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:07.360]   So this is...
[00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:10.200]   I think you just call a truck to take him wherever he wants.
[00:41:10.200 --> 00:41:11.200]   Yeah.
[00:41:11.200 --> 00:41:15.200]   So they said he downloaded 14,000 documents, I think.
[00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:16.200]   Yeah.
[00:41:16.200 --> 00:41:17.200]   And Uber paid him a lot.
[00:41:17.200 --> 00:41:20.200]   And he claims that he did that for work.
[00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:21.200]   Yes.
[00:41:21.200 --> 00:41:26.200]   But on his civil thing, Uber settled with Waymo.
[00:41:26.200 --> 00:41:27.200]   Oh, interesting.
[00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:28.200]   Uber settled with Google.
[00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:29.200]   They settled...
[00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:30.200]   So the civil suit was over?
[00:41:30.200 --> 00:41:31.200]   Yeah.
[00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:33.200]   They settled for $245 million.
[00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:35.200]   It was a lot of money.
[00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:36.200]   Wow.
[00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:37.200]   Oh, yeah.
[00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:41.200]   So, but then the judge was like, "You know what?
[00:41:41.200 --> 00:41:42.200]   This doesn't look civil.
[00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:43.200]   This looks criminal."
[00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:44.200]   Oh, yeah.
[00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:49.200]   So the judge decided, "Okay, we're going to continue to pursue this."
[00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:50.200]   That's unusual.
[00:41:50.200 --> 00:41:57.160]   Like, not just to have a civil suit that's settled then picked up, but made a criminal
[00:41:57.160 --> 00:41:58.160]   case.
[00:41:58.160 --> 00:41:59.160]   Yeah.
[00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:03.240]   The time says this rarely happens with software or intellectual property.
[00:42:03.240 --> 00:42:09.080]   Almost always has to do with a big hardware theft.
[00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:10.080]   So it can...
[00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:12.560]   I guess the value of it is huge.
[00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:15.200]   Maybe they think it's necessary.
[00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:16.200]   Yeah.
[00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:21.600]   So his next court date, September 4th, could face up to 10 years in prison and a quarter
[00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:24.640]   million dollar fine for every count.
[00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:26.800]   You could do the math 33 times a quarter million.
[00:42:26.800 --> 00:42:28.800]   It's still less than they settled for.
[00:42:28.800 --> 00:42:31.320]   But of course, it was my card for though.
[00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:32.320]   It's kind of uber-thist.
[00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:36.320]   Because a bunch of what he took with him was schematics for proprietary circuit boards,
[00:42:36.320 --> 00:42:38.320]   I think, in designs.
[00:42:38.320 --> 00:42:39.320]   Yeah.
[00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:40.320]   Wow.
[00:42:40.320 --> 00:42:49.080]   Uber agreed to provide 0.34% of its stock to alphabet in the settlement.
[00:42:49.080 --> 00:42:53.200]   But as you say, the federal judge referred the case to the US Attorney's office and they
[00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:56.200]   have decided to prosecute.
[00:42:56.200 --> 00:42:58.400]   What a story that is.
[00:42:58.400 --> 00:42:59.400]   Yeah.
[00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:00.400]   Yeah.
[00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:07.520]   Well, and so sketchy, so dodgy.
[00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:08.520]   And it just brings...
[00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:13.280]   I mean, it kind of brings back to the point of like that whole culture of Travis, Ken
[00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:14.280]   never seen his name.
[00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:19.560]   Yeah, because apparently, I mean, there's some evidence it was Calonex idea that he went
[00:43:19.560 --> 00:43:23.960]   to Levendasky and said, "Come on over and bring some stuff with you."
[00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:26.600]   Yeah, but if you're that kind of person, I mean, like, if someone comes up to me and
[00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:29.040]   is like, "Hey, let's take your..."
[00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:30.040]   No.
[00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:31.040]   I would be like, "No."
[00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:32.040]   No.
[00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:33.040]   You get my brain, that's it.
[00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:34.040]   Yeah.
[00:43:34.040 --> 00:43:38.640]   And like, Otto was his attempt to take that stuff and create his own thing, right?
[00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:41.400]   Yeah, so maybe he was doing it for himself initially.
[00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:42.400]   Yeah.
[00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:43.400]   Right.
[00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:44.400]   Still dodgy.
[00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:47.680]   And he may have thought it was his, you know, the fruits of his labor.
[00:43:47.680 --> 00:43:49.800]   I'm sure he felt very entitled to it.
[00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:50.800]   Yeah.
[00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:53.800]   Even though he was probably being paid a butt ton of money.
[00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:54.800]   But that's a classic case.
[00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:55.800]   A lot of...
[00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:56.800]   A what?
[00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:57.800]   A butt ton?
[00:43:57.800 --> 00:43:58.800]   Is that our new measurement?
[00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:00.800]   That's one of my favorite measures.
[00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:04.640]   It's 53 Cardi B's, I believe.
[00:44:04.640 --> 00:44:05.640]   Nice.
[00:44:05.640 --> 00:44:08.880]   Or then, for crap.
[00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:11.240]   Let's take a break.
[00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:12.240]   For all this.
[00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:15.800]   On that note.
[00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:18.240]   And many, many tons.
[00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:21.600]   And talk about our wonderful sponsor.
[00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:25.760]   And you know, it's funny because I told everybody before the show, we got a new sponsor.
[00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:26.760]   It's Zapier.
[00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:30.720]   And everybody said, "Yay, we love Zapier, don't we?"
[00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:37.240]   Zapier is an automation tool for business or individuals.
[00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:38.840]   I use it.
[00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:39.840]   I have a...
[00:44:39.840 --> 00:44:41.600]   So they call the little scripts "zaps."
[00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:44.560]   And they allow you to connect your apps.
[00:44:44.560 --> 00:44:48.120]   And by the way, no one has more integrations than Zapier.
[00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:50.720]   1500 plus apps.
[00:44:50.720 --> 00:44:52.680]   They work with every app you use.
[00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:57.280]   So for instance, my current Zap, I got to log into my Zapier so I could show you how
[00:44:57.280 --> 00:44:59.600]   easy it is to make and modify a Zap.
[00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:05.840]   One of the things that's cool about Zapier is you could do multi-branches.
[00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:11.960]   So there's no kind of no limit on how many steps a Zap can take.
[00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:20.280]   So I'll show you my existing Zap, which is a pretty big one here.
[00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:24.440]   This is a Pinboard Bookmarks published everywhere.
[00:45:24.440 --> 00:45:29.880]   And this is what I use when I'm preparing this show and all the shows that we do.
[00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:34.760]   If I star an article on my news reader or...
[00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:39.480]   And I have also another Zap that does it if I add it to Pinboard, it tweets about it.
[00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:41.880]   And then it creates a row and a spreadsheet.
[00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:45.840]   And look how elaborate these steps can be.
[00:45:45.840 --> 00:45:48.000]   These are the actions and they have lots of actions.
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:49.000]   They have built-in apps.
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:50.280]   They have popular apps.
[00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:52.280]   You can have it do things like in a Google Sheet.
[00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:58.400]   It creates a spreadsheet row and then you attach the account and then you have a template.
[00:45:58.400 --> 00:46:04.280]   And so it has the information from the various steps.
[00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:05.920]   And you say, "I want this, this, and this."
[00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:09.100]   And what I've been able to do is duplicate the spreadsheet Carsten uses to build the
[00:46:09.100 --> 00:46:10.880]   show with another spreadsheet.
[00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:13.240]   We call it links from Leo.
[00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:14.240]   You test the step.
[00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:16.280]   This is so incredibly useful.
[00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:20.680]   You know, they always say, "If you're spending time doing anything more than once, you should
[00:46:20.680 --> 00:46:22.880]   spend a little time automating it."
[00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:25.960]   Zapier makes that possible.
[00:46:25.960 --> 00:46:28.480]   If you're in sales, you can engage your leads instantly.
[00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:30.360]   You can automatically import new customers.
[00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:33.400]   You can notify your team about opportunities.
[00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:40.040]   Because they support multi-step zaps like my Zap, the possibilities are endless.
[00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:41.560]   And you don't have to be a programmer.
[00:46:41.560 --> 00:46:42.560]   You don't have to be a geek.
[00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:44.500]   It's very straightforward.
[00:46:44.500 --> 00:46:46.960]   You could build a solution you need in minutes, test it.
[00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:50.120]   They have great testing facilities built in.
[00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:53.240]   So you know exactly what works and what doesn't work.
[00:46:53.240 --> 00:46:54.920]   No more wasting your time on tasks.
[00:46:54.920 --> 00:46:57.720]   You know it could be automated, but it's just too much work to do it.
[00:46:57.720 --> 00:46:59.640]   Or, I don't know, I don't want to spend.
[00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:01.680]   No, you could totally do it.
[00:47:01.680 --> 00:47:05.080]   Zapier, Z-A-P-I-E-R.
[00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:07.040]   Go to zapier.com/tweid.
[00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:08.040]   Connect the apps you use most.
[00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:10.440]   Let Zapier take it from there.
[00:47:10.440 --> 00:47:11.440]   You don't have to be a coder.
[00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:14.880]   You don't have to ask a developer for help.
[00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:15.880]   We love Zapier.
[00:47:15.880 --> 00:47:22.000]   Anybody who's processing information, using for IoT, all kinds of things.
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:27.680]   More than 4.5 million people on Zapier right now saving an average of more than 40 hours
[00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:30.400]   a month.
[00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:32.960]   That's like a work week every month.
[00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:39.080]   You can see I have a lot of zaps over times that I've done in the past.
[00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:42.080]   And some are turned on and some are turned off right now.
[00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:43.080]   But I just love it.
[00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:45.080]   It's a really great box setup.
[00:47:45.080 --> 00:47:46.280]   Little chat box.
[00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:47.680]   It's really great.
[00:47:47.680 --> 00:47:49.120]   Z-A-P-I-E-R.
[00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:55.400]   Zapier, 14 day free trial when you go to zapier.com/tweid.
[00:47:55.400 --> 00:47:56.400]   There is a free tier.
[00:47:56.400 --> 00:48:00.240]   I pay for the, they call it the starter, but it's more than enough for me.
[00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:02.160]   I think you get 20 zaps.
[00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:08.080]   But maybe for your business, you'd want to have more.
[00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:10.040]   It's really fantastic Zapier.
[00:48:10.040 --> 00:48:12.920]   Can't recommend it more highly.
[00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:15.600]   And there's a professional and then there's professional plus.
[00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:21.040]   So depending on how you use Zapier or maybe use it in the office, there's team and company
[00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:23.160]   Zapier accounts as well.
[00:48:23.160 --> 00:48:25.080]   Really, really powerful.
[00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:26.080]   Love it.
[00:48:26.080 --> 00:48:27.080]   Zapier.com/tweid.
[00:48:27.080 --> 00:48:28.080]   Okay.
[00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:32.560]   I think we've, this was our cooling off period.
[00:48:32.560 --> 00:48:33.560]   Yeah.
[00:48:33.560 --> 00:48:40.280]   I just set up a thing that anytime anyone emails our new show, ask the tech guy.
[00:48:40.280 --> 00:48:41.280]   Yeah.
[00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:47.360]   Anytime anyone sends us a question, it automatically populates spreadsheet for us.
[00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:48.360]   Yeah.
[00:48:48.360 --> 00:48:50.880]   It's a great way to handle email.
[00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:52.080]   Email so out of control.
[00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:56.960]   Anything you can do to handle email is great and it's fantastic for that.
[00:48:56.960 --> 00:48:58.520]   Google, this is an interesting.
[00:48:58.520 --> 00:49:04.080]   Paul Therat had this reportedly planning to move its smartphone production out of China
[00:49:04.080 --> 00:49:06.280]   into Vietnam.
[00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:10.080]   Good thing you bought that 3A now.
[00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:12.160]   This is the last Chinese version.
[00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:13.840]   They're going to have problems with the ramp up.
[00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:14.840]   Maybe.
[00:49:14.840 --> 00:49:15.840]   Yeah.
[00:49:15.840 --> 00:49:16.840]   And then some of it will go to Thailand.
[00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:23.920]   Now, the good news is Samsung uses South Korean but also Thailand to manufacture its
[00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:24.920]   phone.
[00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:26.840]   So there is some manufacturing base.
[00:49:26.840 --> 00:49:28.680]   I don't know about Vietnam.
[00:49:28.680 --> 00:49:31.520]   How much of this is economic and how much of it is political?
[00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:34.000]   It's completely political.
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:36.480]   But let's, but well, it's in response to tariffs.
[00:49:36.480 --> 00:49:37.480]   So it's both that.
[00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:39.120]   I was like, which could become economic.
[00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:40.120]   Well, yeah.
[00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:41.680]   It's just tariffs.
[00:49:41.680 --> 00:49:46.320]   New tariffs begin September 1st and then there's another set going in December at, I mean,
[00:49:46.320 --> 00:49:47.320]   it changes all the time.
[00:49:47.320 --> 00:49:49.320]   That's the last time I checked.
[00:49:49.320 --> 00:49:55.320]   There's also this greater threat from a presidential tweet a few days ago that he's going to ban
[00:49:55.320 --> 00:50:02.240]   companies in the US from doing business in China at all.
[00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:04.960]   Which he can apparently enforce.
[00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:11.560]   Legally, under what law?
[00:50:11.560 --> 00:50:14.360]   Under the law that he's the president.
[00:50:14.360 --> 00:50:15.360]   Yeah.
[00:50:15.360 --> 00:50:16.920]   I'm just going to keep going.
[00:50:16.920 --> 00:50:20.280]   He five days ago, he tweeted, I hear this.
[00:50:20.280 --> 00:50:24.400]   I hear by what do you say?
[00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:25.400]   Here by order.
[00:50:25.400 --> 00:50:29.200]   I hear by order.
[00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:32.560]   All of the, this was during the G seven.
[00:50:32.560 --> 00:50:36.200]   Now he doesn't have the authority to duly order companies to leave China according to
[00:50:36.200 --> 00:50:39.600]   a Georgetown University law professor.
[00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:42.680]   But he can prevent future transfers of funds to China.
[00:50:42.680 --> 00:50:49.240]   In other words, he could cut off the financial transactions which would effectively cut off
[00:50:49.240 --> 00:50:50.840]   manufacture.
[00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:55.800]   But according to this professor, he would first have to make a lawful declaration that
[00:50:55.800 --> 00:50:57.840]   a national emergency exists.
[00:50:57.840 --> 00:51:02.120]   Congress could terminate that.
[00:51:02.120 --> 00:51:07.840]   It's, it's, it would be, it would be disastrous.
[00:51:07.840 --> 00:51:09.680]   It would be a good one.
[00:51:09.680 --> 00:51:11.480]   Parliament is pro-rogged.
[00:51:11.480 --> 00:51:13.960]   What has happened to democracies around the world?
[00:51:13.960 --> 00:51:15.760]   Yeah, that's a wild one.
[00:51:15.760 --> 00:51:21.640]   I don't, I know, I can't pretend to really understand what a no deal Brexit means.
[00:51:21.640 --> 00:51:27.640]   But apparently that's kind of the equivalent of this.
[00:51:27.640 --> 00:51:29.120]   She's got her hands over his.
[00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:31.320]   I can't hear you.
[00:51:31.320 --> 00:51:33.920]   Boris is basically going to try and shove it through.
[00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:34.920]   Right.
[00:51:34.920 --> 00:51:36.920]   While Parliament is pro-rogged.
[00:51:36.920 --> 00:51:37.920]   Yeah, by putting off.
[00:51:37.920 --> 00:51:40.360]   So then they don't have to cut a deal or vote on a deal.
[00:51:40.360 --> 00:51:42.520]   So they could have a no deal Brexit because the deadline is coming.
[00:51:42.520 --> 00:51:45.120]   If they don't have a deal, then it doesn't matter.
[00:51:45.120 --> 00:51:48.760]   It's going to happen.
[00:51:48.760 --> 00:51:51.760]   No wonder we're heading into economic chaos.
[00:51:51.760 --> 00:51:56.840]   What else can we talk about about Google?
[00:51:56.840 --> 00:51:58.840]   It's a Google story.
[00:51:58.840 --> 00:52:00.840]   No, we're getting into this area.
[00:52:00.840 --> 00:52:04.880]   There are phones out for smart production of Vietnam.
[00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:06.520]   That's a Google story.
[00:52:06.520 --> 00:52:08.280]   We talk about the underlying issues.
[00:52:08.280 --> 00:52:12.200]   These are underlying issues that they're so intractable.
[00:52:12.200 --> 00:52:13.200]   They're intractable.
[00:52:13.200 --> 00:52:14.200]   And frustrating.
[00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:15.200]   And frustrating.
[00:52:15.200 --> 00:52:16.720]   But I'm not, I'm not.
[00:52:16.720 --> 00:52:17.720]   Demoralizing.
[00:52:17.720 --> 00:52:18.720]   So how about this?
[00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:23.160]   Google has decided because of these intractable demoralizing issues, they're not going to let
[00:52:23.160 --> 00:52:28.800]   anybody talk about embarrassing stuff that gets leaked from their internal message boards.
[00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:31.200]   They say Google becomes a grown up company.
[00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:32.400]   Is that normal in a company?
[00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:34.600]   Yeah, we certainly would know now.
[00:52:34.600 --> 00:52:35.600]   Yes.
[00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:37.200]   That kind of thing, right?
[00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:44.000]   Well, I know, I mean, depending on your employee base, you wouldn't do it anyway because, I
[00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:47.520]   mean, you're kind of poisoning the well there, you know.
[00:52:47.520 --> 00:52:53.080]   Many large companies have a code of conduct.
[00:52:53.080 --> 00:52:57.520]   The Google guidelines, which are on top of the code of conics here, primary responsibility
[00:52:57.520 --> 00:53:02.600]   is to do the work we've each been hired to do, not spend time working on debates about
[00:53:02.600 --> 00:53:03.760]   non-work topics.
[00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:06.560]   That's fair enough.
[00:53:06.560 --> 00:53:07.560]   It is.
[00:53:07.560 --> 00:53:11.400]   I would tell my employees that too.
[00:53:11.400 --> 00:53:14.800]   But I mean, you can't stop people from gathering in the lunchroom and having conversations
[00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:18.240]   or human beings, but you can keep a rough line.
[00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:22.280]   So you can't be prevented from discussing certain topics in the workplace, but you could
[00:53:22.280 --> 00:53:27.880]   keep it off of company run discussion boards slack.
[00:53:27.880 --> 00:53:28.880]   Right.
[00:53:28.880 --> 00:53:29.880]   And let's look what's happened here.
[00:53:29.880 --> 00:53:30.880]   It's been manipulated.
[00:53:30.880 --> 00:53:32.720]   Like everything in life, it has been manipulated.
[00:53:32.720 --> 00:53:34.520]   And so you have some players.
[00:53:34.520 --> 00:53:35.520]   What's his name?
[00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:38.040]   Who was the guy who wrote the horrible memo?
[00:53:38.040 --> 00:53:39.520]   James Moore, James Moore.
[00:53:39.520 --> 00:53:40.760]   James Moore, right?
[00:53:40.760 --> 00:53:42.280]   He knew what was going to happen with that.
[00:53:42.280 --> 00:53:49.120]   The goal was to get pulled down and then complain about this horrible, you know, liberal
[00:53:49.120 --> 00:53:50.440]   behemoth.
[00:53:50.440 --> 00:53:54.040]   And so at that point, what choice do you have when you're manipulated that way, but to say
[00:53:54.040 --> 00:53:55.520]   let's cut off that path?
[00:53:55.520 --> 00:54:01.840]   But there's also, I think there's allegations that retaliated against the leaders of the
[00:54:01.840 --> 00:54:02.840]   B2.
[00:54:02.840 --> 00:54:03.840]   That's a different matter.
[00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:07.040]   Well, not just the YouTube thing, but also the walkouts.
[00:54:07.040 --> 00:54:08.040]   Yeah.
[00:54:08.040 --> 00:54:11.960]   And that's a very different matter because that goes to labor law around organization
[00:54:11.960 --> 00:54:13.320]   and other things.
[00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:14.320]   That's different.
[00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:15.320]   That's about that.
[00:54:15.320 --> 00:54:20.800]   But that then, Matthew, is still about the workplace as opposed to Amor is talking about,
[00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:22.680]   you know, wars against men.
[00:54:22.680 --> 00:54:23.680]   Right.
[00:54:23.680 --> 00:54:30.280]   I'm just saying that in that case, the allegation is that Google is trying to penalize people
[00:54:30.280 --> 00:54:32.280]   for speech that it doesn't like.
[00:54:32.280 --> 00:54:33.280]   Right.
[00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:34.280]   And there's an issue there.
[00:54:34.280 --> 00:54:35.880]   I agree that that's not the thing.
[00:54:35.880 --> 00:54:38.680]   This is a perfect example of HR stepping in and saying, oh, we're just going to ban
[00:54:38.680 --> 00:54:39.680]   the whole thing.
[00:54:39.680 --> 00:54:40.680]   It's just, yeah.
[00:54:40.680 --> 00:54:44.840]   Well, and there's, I mean, as they should be honest, I mean, Matthew, when we were on
[00:54:44.840 --> 00:54:51.400]   Slack, both in Fortune and in Gigahome, I don't think either of us were like, hey,
[00:54:51.400 --> 00:54:55.440]   hey, let's plot something, you know, so we can make our companies look bad.
[00:54:55.440 --> 00:54:56.440]   Look at your company.
[00:54:56.440 --> 00:54:57.840]   It was as huge as I know.
[00:54:57.840 --> 00:55:02.400]   But I could see if we had, let's say there was a protest, we might have dropped something
[00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:06.920]   into a Slack room saying, hey, there's a protest, you know, come on out.
[00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:07.920]   That's true.
[00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:10.320]   We did talk about in the timing because a decent side.
[00:55:10.320 --> 00:55:13.600]   I mean, no, it's not Google sized, but it was a fair size company.
[00:55:13.600 --> 00:55:14.600]   Right.
[00:55:14.600 --> 00:55:15.600]   No test.
[00:55:15.600 --> 00:55:18.600]   I was trying to get going when they took away the peanut butter machine.
[00:55:18.600 --> 00:55:19.600]   Remember that?
[00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:20.600]   Damn, I love that.
[00:55:20.600 --> 00:55:22.600]   I think I was, I was, I left after the peanut butter.
[00:55:22.600 --> 00:55:24.600]   It was a peanut butter incident.
[00:55:24.600 --> 00:55:25.600]   It was amazing.
[00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:26.600]   Yeah.
[00:55:26.600 --> 00:55:27.600]   Yeah.
[00:55:27.600 --> 00:55:28.600]   It was a huge fiasco.
[00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:29.600]   You know what?
[00:55:29.600 --> 00:55:34.840]   We're going to put in is a peanut butter machine and a peanut butter hazelnut machine.
[00:55:34.840 --> 00:55:37.040]   It made peanut chocolate right in front of you.
[00:55:37.040 --> 00:55:38.040]   Yeah.
[00:55:38.040 --> 00:55:39.680]   I heard about the peanut butter machine.
[00:55:39.680 --> 00:55:40.680]   My goodness.
[00:55:40.680 --> 00:55:42.240]   I didn't know about this.
[00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:45.200]   And then at one point, there was like police tape across it.
[00:55:45.200 --> 00:55:49.840]   You couldn't use it because because people were allergic peanut butter privilege.
[00:55:49.840 --> 00:55:51.240]   Oh, they were allergic.
[00:55:51.240 --> 00:55:53.480]   So people who were allergic to complaint.
[00:55:53.480 --> 00:55:55.040]   They should have made it on the part.
[00:55:55.040 --> 00:55:56.200]   Our editors would die if we had that.
[00:55:56.200 --> 00:55:57.200]   We do have editors.
[00:55:57.200 --> 00:55:58.200]   They just took the whole thing.
[00:55:58.200 --> 00:55:59.200]   Yeah.
[00:55:59.200 --> 00:56:00.200]   So that's why we have the road.
[00:56:00.200 --> 00:56:02.560]   And I could totally see that, but I loved it.
[00:56:02.560 --> 00:56:05.400]   Ain't nobody don't like roady.
[00:56:05.400 --> 00:56:06.400]   Yeah.
[00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:07.400]   Okay.
[00:56:07.400 --> 00:56:10.400]   You two kids.
[00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:18.560]   You two kids introduce his content filter for preschoolers, which will launch this week.
[00:56:18.560 --> 00:56:20.120]   That is so sad.
[00:56:20.120 --> 00:56:22.120]   Isn't it sad?
[00:56:22.120 --> 00:56:27.640]   If you're age four and under, this is designed to allow kids to watch videos that promote
[00:56:27.640 --> 00:56:31.040]   creativity, playfulness, learning and exploration.
[00:56:31.040 --> 00:56:37.640]   Five to seven explore interest search for wide variety of topics, including songs, cartoons,
[00:56:37.640 --> 00:56:41.160]   and more.
[00:56:41.160 --> 00:56:43.400]   If you're eight, I'm really trying to do this straight.
[00:56:43.400 --> 00:56:49.120]   Eight to 12 allow kids with growing independence to search and explore additional music videos,
[00:56:49.120 --> 00:56:52.560]   gaming, family vlogs, science and more.
[00:56:52.560 --> 00:56:55.920]   When you pick a filter, you'll see a preview of the type of content that's associated with
[00:56:55.920 --> 00:56:56.920]   it.
[00:56:56.920 --> 00:57:02.200]   Parents, of course, will be the ones implementing the filters, not the kids.
[00:57:02.200 --> 00:57:07.800]   So when you sign up the kid for YouTube, you'll see what they're allowed to see.
[00:57:07.800 --> 00:57:08.800]   Is this a good solution?
[00:57:08.800 --> 00:57:09.800]   Will it work?
[00:57:09.800 --> 00:57:12.120]   I don't think it'll work, but it's a...
[00:57:12.120 --> 00:57:13.120]   I don't think it'll work.
[00:57:13.120 --> 00:57:14.120]   It'll work.
[00:57:14.120 --> 00:57:15.120]   Why won't it work?
[00:57:15.120 --> 00:57:16.840]   We'll get people to sign stuff to get through.
[00:57:16.840 --> 00:57:18.320]   Yeah, probably.
[00:57:18.320 --> 00:57:21.440]   I mean, kids will design things to get through.
[00:57:21.440 --> 00:57:23.880]   Well, I mean, a four-year-old really does...
[00:57:23.880 --> 00:57:26.800]   A four-year-old is not looking for.
[00:57:26.800 --> 00:57:30.200]   But there are people who will design stuff to get through.
[00:57:30.200 --> 00:57:31.760]   And there are things...
[00:57:31.760 --> 00:57:34.920]   And the other thing to think about is everybody's standards of what they want their kids to
[00:57:34.920 --> 00:57:36.640]   watch is going to be a little bit different.
[00:57:36.640 --> 00:57:39.720]   Well, it's parental controls so that you get to choose, right?
[00:57:39.720 --> 00:57:44.200]   Well, you get to choose somewhat, but some people are probably going to find some things
[00:57:44.200 --> 00:57:46.880]   a little more offensive than other things.
[00:57:46.880 --> 00:57:47.880]   So...
[00:57:47.880 --> 00:57:51.960]   So I didn't mention, but there is a fourth choice which is approve content yourself.
[00:57:51.960 --> 00:57:53.880]   That's effectively a parental whitelist.
[00:57:53.880 --> 00:57:57.560]   Ooh, that I'm pro, but it does take a lot of work.
[00:57:57.560 --> 00:57:59.120]   Boy, yeah.
[00:57:59.120 --> 00:58:00.120]   It's work.
[00:58:00.120 --> 00:58:01.360]   Yeah, you'd have to go through each video yourself.
[00:58:01.360 --> 00:58:03.040]   Most people don't do it.
[00:58:03.040 --> 00:58:04.280]   I used to.
[00:58:04.280 --> 00:58:05.600]   I don't anymore.
[00:58:05.600 --> 00:58:06.600]   Now I do spot checks.
[00:58:06.600 --> 00:58:11.120]   And my daughter knows I do spot checks, but I spot check what she's been looking on YouTube.
[00:58:11.120 --> 00:58:13.200]   But beforehand, I actually did use...
[00:58:13.200 --> 00:58:14.760]   You have access to her history, Stacy?
[00:58:14.760 --> 00:58:15.760]   Yes.
[00:58:15.760 --> 00:58:16.760]   How do you do the spot checks?
[00:58:16.760 --> 00:58:17.760]   Okay.
[00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:18.760]   I have access to her history.
[00:58:18.760 --> 00:58:22.720]   And you know, she's not wiping history.
[00:58:22.720 --> 00:58:23.720]   That's true.
[00:58:23.720 --> 00:58:25.040]   She might be wiping her history.
[00:58:25.040 --> 00:58:26.040]   She has a...
[00:58:26.040 --> 00:58:27.040]   She's got a pro-sphere.
[00:58:27.040 --> 00:58:29.600]   She has a very good, dedicated...
[00:58:29.600 --> 00:58:32.040]   You know, and I trust her.
[00:58:32.040 --> 00:58:33.840]   She's got a script.
[00:58:33.840 --> 00:58:34.840]   She's got a script.
[00:58:34.840 --> 00:58:36.840]   I would be very proud.
[00:58:36.840 --> 00:58:37.840]   Yeah, no kidding.
[00:58:37.840 --> 00:58:38.840]   She'd be like...
[00:58:38.840 --> 00:58:40.840]   Showed her how to do it.
[00:58:40.840 --> 00:58:41.840]   She asked me that.
[00:58:41.840 --> 00:58:43.840]   If my restrictions...
[00:58:43.840 --> 00:58:47.880]   Grandpa Matthew, do you speak JavaScript?
[00:58:47.880 --> 00:58:53.520]   I remember when the Internet came out.
[00:58:53.520 --> 00:58:58.840]   I'm kind of doing that with my kids on their TV watching stuff.
[00:58:58.840 --> 00:59:01.200]   You do a pre-approve?
[00:59:01.200 --> 00:59:03.120]   Or you post scan?
[00:59:03.120 --> 00:59:10.400]   I'm loading stuff into the TV that we own that I know is good for them to watch.
[00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:11.920]   Just to make it easier for them.
[00:59:11.920 --> 00:59:12.920]   There you go.
[00:59:12.920 --> 00:59:13.920]   Just kind of...
[00:59:13.920 --> 00:59:14.920]   Even if it's on...
[00:59:14.920 --> 00:59:15.920]   Like a path.
[00:59:15.920 --> 00:59:18.240]   Like even if it's stuff that's on Netflix anyways.
[00:59:18.240 --> 00:59:19.240]   Right.
[00:59:19.240 --> 00:59:27.840]   There's a database of all the stuff that I know is good TV and fun stuff to watch.
[00:59:27.840 --> 00:59:30.240]   What I don't get is why YouTube has one spot.
[00:59:30.240 --> 00:59:33.160]   I had this parental controls before.
[00:59:33.160 --> 00:59:35.120]   This seems like the obvious thing to do.
[00:59:35.120 --> 00:59:36.120]   It was pretty obvious.
[00:59:36.120 --> 00:59:37.120]   Yeah.
[00:59:37.120 --> 00:59:38.120]   Yeah.
[00:59:38.120 --> 00:59:39.120]   Because they didn't care, I don't think.
[00:59:39.120 --> 00:59:40.600]   Well, I don't think they cared.
[00:59:40.600 --> 00:59:42.640]   And I think they put a lot of blame on the...
[00:59:42.640 --> 00:59:43.640]   Not blame.
[00:59:43.640 --> 00:59:45.000]   A lot of the onus on the user.
[00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:49.200]   Hey, if this is an under 13 year old, they shouldn't even be here anyway.
[00:59:49.200 --> 00:59:50.200]   Through you.
[00:59:50.200 --> 00:59:52.640]   And basically the market said, "Okay.
[00:59:52.640 --> 00:59:53.640]   Real talk Google."
[00:59:53.640 --> 00:59:54.640]   Yeah.
[00:59:54.640 --> 00:59:55.720]   Our kids are watching this.
[00:59:55.720 --> 00:59:58.040]   People are putting content and you're making money.
[00:59:58.040 --> 01:00:00.080]   Own up and do this.
[01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:04.640]   Do you remember when I wrote about surveilling my kids?
[01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:05.640]   Do you remember that?
[01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:06.640]   Oh, yes.
[01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:07.640]   Yes.
[01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:08.640]   Because you had a keystroke logger on your kids.
[01:00:08.640 --> 01:00:09.640]   What?
[01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:10.640]   That's terrible.
[01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:11.640]   I know.
[01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:12.640]   I know.
[01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:13.640]   I was shocked.
[01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:14.640]   We had this debate.
[01:00:14.640 --> 01:00:15.640]   What I wrote about.
[01:00:15.640 --> 01:00:16.640]   Yeah.
[01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:18.840]   Matthew, my daughter, she wrote their team last week.
[01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:21.240]   And now I'm like, "Ooh, should I put a keystroke?"
[01:00:21.240 --> 01:00:24.040]   And now you're thinking, "Oh, Matthew wasn't so..."
[01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:26.200]   No, I'm still thinking you're wrong.
[01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:29.600]   I'm fortunate because even though we had the internet when my kids were young, it was
[01:00:29.600 --> 01:00:33.400]   early days and there really wasn't much trouble they could get into.
[01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:34.760]   I don't know what I would do as a parent.
[01:00:34.760 --> 01:00:36.240]   It was mostly...
[01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:39.120]   What I was interested in was mostly...
[01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:43.960]   At the time it was AOL instant messenger and MSN and ICQ and stuff like that.
[01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:47.880]   And I wanted to be able to see who they were talking to and what...
[01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:52.280]   If they were saying, "Yeah, I'll meet you at the mall working a lot."
[01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:54.280]   We can take off to Colorado.
[01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:55.280]   After me.
[01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:56.280]   Yeah.
[01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:59.000]   Anyway, I don't feel good about it.
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:01.000]   I did do it.
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:02.920]   How does your daughter feel about it?
[01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:04.560]   She's a result now.
[01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:07.680]   The last part of it was my...
[01:01:07.680 --> 01:01:12.640]   Our middle daughter, I did it with, I think, the two oldest ones, mostly.
[01:01:12.640 --> 01:01:16.800]   But our middle daughter wrote something about it and about how she felt about it, which
[01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:17.800]   I thought was great.
[01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:18.800]   That's good.
[01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:22.600]   Yeah, and she said it first, it bothered her and then she felt...
[01:01:22.600 --> 01:01:24.000]   Because I told her I was doing it.
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:30.520]   And she said it made her feel more comfortable because she knew that I was watching and looking
[01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:31.920]   out for her or whatever.
[01:01:31.920 --> 01:01:34.160]   Maybe she just said that to be nice.
[01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:35.160]   I don't know.
[01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:37.160]   If she was writing the story on me...
[01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:38.160]   On Giggum, yeah.
[01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:41.200]   She didn't want me to be fired.
[01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:47.280]   So I don't do as much Facebook coverage I used to because I just feel like...
[01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:48.280]   Who cares?
[01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:51.040]   I'm not on it, so it doesn't bother me.
[01:01:51.040 --> 01:01:52.600]   I'm not on either, right.
[01:01:52.600 --> 01:01:53.600]   And I think that that...
[01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:57.000]   So we're going to have to let Jeff take the lead on this.
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:59.040]   Here's the story from the Washington Post.
[01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:05.600]   Facebook Titans rules on political advertisers requiring further identity proof, such as
[01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:11.520]   federal election communications registration.
[01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:13.840]   This seems like a good thing, Jeff, is it?
[01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:14.840]   Yeah, I think it is.
[01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:15.840]   I think it is.
[01:02:15.840 --> 01:02:22.160]   Where they got in hot water here was that any ad that has political subject matter was
[01:02:22.160 --> 01:02:23.160]   subject to this.
[01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:28.240]   Thus when newspapers advertised their political coverage, they were subject to it and they
[01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:30.160]   got quite pissy about it.
[01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:35.120]   But I think the mistake there was not making the requirement broader than just political
[01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:36.120]   ads.
[01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:40.320]   I think that having transparency around who places ads and who wants to manipulate your
[01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:44.400]   brain is a fine standard and there should be transparency around it.
[01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:46.080]   I think the more there is, the better.
[01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:52.800]   I think as Facebook's want is, they by limiting it, I think they got in hot water they didn't
[01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:54.400]   need to get into.
[01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:57.920]   So on the downside for media companies was they...
[01:02:57.920 --> 01:02:58.920]   In order to...
[01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:04.120]   I actually interviewed a bunch of small publishers about this and big media companies wasn't
[01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:11.320]   a problem, but you had to register in order to be allowed to basically promote your news
[01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:15.320]   story about a political topic and the political topics were incredibly broad.
[01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:23.360]   So if it was a story that was interpreted to be about a mayor or someone in the legislature,
[01:03:23.360 --> 01:03:27.600]   someone in Congress, then by definition it was political even if the issue itself wasn't
[01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:28.600]   political.
[01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:31.120]   And to register was an incredibly time consuming...
[01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:38.840]   Right, so the problem was it was a very time consuming process to get authorized.
[01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:42.400]   And you had to provide personal information and your address.
[01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:47.040]   You have any objection to it on principle, Matthew?
[01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:52.600]   No, I mean, if it's my biggest problem with it was that it was so broad that lots of things
[01:03:52.600 --> 01:03:53.920]   were lumped in there.
[01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:58.800]   So this one woman I was talking to said they did a story about water quality and somehow
[01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:00.120]   they...
[01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:05.240]   It was denied they couldn't promote the story on their page because Facebook said, "Well,
[01:04:05.240 --> 01:04:07.240]   that's a political topic."
[01:04:07.240 --> 01:04:11.880]   And let's not forget most of these publishers have to promote their stories because the
[01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:16.880]   algorithm doesn't surface them for people because Facebook has tuned to the point where
[01:04:16.880 --> 01:04:20.280]   lots of people's stuff doesn't even show up.
[01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:22.280]   And then they're told they can't promote it because it's...
[01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:25.880]   We already have a model for this in the broadcast rules though.
[01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:31.960]   I mean, really the problem here is that these rules exist and are strictly enforced for broadcast
[01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:35.360]   advertising but they were never made for digital advertising.
[01:04:35.360 --> 01:04:37.360]   Couldn't we apply the broadcast model?
[01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:41.120]   I'm going to get nervous about ever trying to make the internet and the broadcasters what's
[01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:42.280]   happening in Europe.
[01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:45.400]   So I want to avoid that kind of language.
[01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:49.040]   But I think that voluntarily for Facebook to do this, but another way to have done this
[01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:54.400]   is to say, I'm here in Austin because organizations like Cross Project and reporters without
[01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:58.560]   borders, journalists and cross-conditioners are here and we're having a meeting around
[01:04:58.560 --> 01:04:59.760]   research around trust.
[01:04:59.760 --> 01:05:04.560]   But one thing that the industry is pushing on itself is to be transparent about ownership
[01:05:04.560 --> 01:05:07.440]   and contact and use of charge and all of that.
[01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:11.960]   The FCC doesn't regulate online so I guess online has to do it although Congress could
[01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:12.960]   pass...
[01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:15.360]   Let me read you the FCC regulation.
[01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:18.080]   This strikes me as eminently reasonable and fair.
[01:05:18.080 --> 01:05:22.680]   When a broadcast station transmits any matter for which money, service or other valuable
[01:05:22.680 --> 01:05:28.440]   consideration is either directly or indirectly paid or promised to or charged or accepted
[01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:33.240]   by such a station, the station at the time of the broadcast shall announce that such
[01:05:33.240 --> 01:05:39.480]   matter is sponsored, paid for, furnished, either whole and part and by whom or on whose behalf
[01:05:39.480 --> 01:05:42.800]   such consideration was supplied.
[01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:43.960]   Is this just political will or?
[01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:45.960]   This is for everything.
[01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:46.960]   All advertising.
[01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:48.960]   They don't do that.
[01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:53.720]   They don't announce it on the air that this toothpaste has brought to you by...
[01:05:53.720 --> 01:05:57.960]   In the case, well, I think that as long as the sponsor's name but you're right, in political
[01:05:57.960 --> 01:06:01.960]   advertising that's why you see I approve this message.
[01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:05.600]   In the case of any television political advertisement concerning candidates for public office
[01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:10.000]   the sponsor should be identified with letters equal to a greater than 4% of the vertical
[01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:11.000]   picture.
[01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:13.160]   I mean, there are rules.
[01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:14.160]   There are rules.
[01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:17.760]   Be careful, my friend, about trying to bring broadcast rules to the other.
[01:06:17.760 --> 01:06:19.360]   No, you'd have to...
[01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:20.640]   Obviously, you can't...
[01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:22.360]   Some of this stuff you can't say.
[01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:24.760]   But yeah, that's interesting.
[01:06:24.760 --> 01:06:28.840]   In the case of a commercial product or service and announcement stating the sponsor's corporate
[01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:33.040]   or trade name or the name of the sponsor's product, when it's clear that the mention
[01:06:33.040 --> 01:06:36.680]   of the name of the product constitutes a sponsorship by the identification should be deemed
[01:06:36.680 --> 01:06:37.840]   sufficient.
[01:06:37.840 --> 01:06:42.800]   So when we do an ad for Zapier, we don't have to say this is paid for by Zapier.
[01:06:42.800 --> 01:06:48.120]   The name saying the name Zapier and it's clearly in a commercial context is sufficient.
[01:06:48.120 --> 01:06:50.640]   There's just the higher standard for political advertising.
[01:06:50.640 --> 01:06:52.920]   Well, I was trying to say something else too.
[01:06:52.920 --> 01:06:58.920]   I think that the journalistic organization should set the standard of transparency and
[01:06:58.920 --> 01:07:03.680]   they should have sat down with Facebook and said, "Okay, we'll show the way.
[01:07:03.680 --> 01:07:05.120]   We will be transparent of our ads."
[01:07:05.120 --> 01:07:09.800]   But to Matthew's point, make it easy on us.
[01:07:09.800 --> 01:07:11.120]   Don't put us through hassle to do that.
[01:07:11.120 --> 01:07:15.400]   But I think there's nothing wrong with requiring transparency in our own business.
[01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:21.760]   If I'm doing it, if I buy an ad to promote an article or a piece in a journalistic entity,
[01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:23.560]   that's not a political ad.
[01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:26.360]   Why is that being confused with a political ad?
[01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:33.760]   Because you might have right part or info wars or Jeff's political newsletter.
[01:07:33.760 --> 01:07:36.520]   This is where we get in trouble, isn't it?
[01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:41.680]   I make a faux view of what a news organization is to get around the rules of this.
[01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:45.320]   Well, there's a huge battle going on right now because Beto O'Rourke's campaign kicked
[01:07:45.320 --> 01:07:49.240]   Breitbart out of an appearance saying they're not a news organization.
[01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:53.280]   Breitbart says, "Well, of course we are."
[01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:56.960]   And I'm seeing both sides argue that on Twitter.
[01:07:56.960 --> 01:08:01.240]   I think it's a bad look to kick any organization out.
[01:08:01.240 --> 01:08:04.840]   I think regardless of what you think of Breitbart, that was a dumb move.
[01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:06.840]   It seems like it doesn't move.
[01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:07.840]   It seems like it doesn't move.

[01:12:52.840 --> 01:12:53.840]   It seems like it doesn't move.
[01:12:53.840 --> 01:13:00.840]   Jeb Rubinfeld writing in the National Review, the right way to regulate big tech.
[01:13:00.840 --> 01:13:05.840]   Wait, I don't think this is bad.
[01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:06.840]   I don't even know what it says.
[01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:07.840]   I just get that.
[01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:08.840]   I'm so tired.
[01:13:08.840 --> 01:13:11.840]   Well, this is an interesting one.
[01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:13.840]   By the way, I love the lead.
[01:13:13.840 --> 01:13:17.840]   He says, "Imagine you're living a millennium ago in 1980.
[01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:19.840]   You get off a call with an old friend.
[01:13:19.840 --> 01:13:20.840]   A moment later, the phone rings again.
[01:13:20.840 --> 01:13:22.840]   It's an operator from AT&T.
[01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:23.840]   Good news is the operator.
[01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:27.840]   Based on what you and your old friend were just saying, our partner retailers have some
[01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:30.840]   great products we know you'd be interested in."
[01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:34.840]   Oh, and by the way, some of your comments about immigration violated our hate speech
[01:13:34.840 --> 01:13:37.840]   policy, so we're going to have to suspend you temporarily.
[01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:40.840]   It's kind of what's going on, isn't it?
[01:13:40.840 --> 01:13:44.840]   He proposes, and by the way, Neelite Patel on Twitter completely dismisses this, but I
[01:13:44.840 --> 01:13:51.840]   don't think it's a bad idea since you can guess to me that Facebook makes on average
[01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:59.840]   the ARPU, the ARPU average revenue per user of about $112 per user.
[01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:05.840]   If every American Facebook user paid $112 a year, Facebook would have the same US revenues
[01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:07.840]   without any advertising or data mining.
[01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:11.840]   What if Facebook had, on the front page, a clear switch?
[01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:15.840]   You could continue to use Facebook for free, but here's what we're going to gather about
[01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:16.840]   you.
[01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:20.840]   So poor people get surveilled, but rich people can afford not to.
[01:14:20.840 --> 01:14:21.840]   That's right there.
[01:14:21.840 --> 01:14:23.840]   It is the one flaw with that.
[01:14:23.840 --> 01:14:26.840]   It's the one flaw, but it's not a, it's a fundamental way to do it.
[01:14:26.840 --> 01:14:29.840]   If you want a private Facebook, you pay a few bucks a month.
[01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:34.840]   And then you go to the YouTube, and then you're going to do it for Twitter.
[01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:37.840]   See, this is why this is what the government is.
[01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:41.840]   No, this is what government exists to protect poor people.
[01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:42.840]   Right.
[01:14:42.840 --> 01:14:44.840]   So people who can't afford to pay a permit.
[01:14:44.840 --> 01:14:48.840]   Are you saying that poor people should be able to use a service that costs money for
[01:14:48.840 --> 01:14:51.840]   free?
[01:14:51.840 --> 01:14:53.840]   I'm saying they should be able to use a service.
[01:14:53.840 --> 01:14:56.840]   Why don't we just send them subscriptions to New York Times for free?
[01:14:56.840 --> 01:14:57.840]   No, no, no, no.
[01:14:57.840 --> 01:14:58.840]   We have a free Comcast subscription.
[01:14:58.840 --> 01:14:59.840]   Really good.
[01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:00.840]   It's fine.
[01:15:00.840 --> 01:15:01.840]   Just because they can't afford it.
[01:15:01.840 --> 01:15:03.840]   But they should not be surveilled with their notes.
[01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:06.840]   They have a company's build business models based on surveillance.
[01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:08.840]   And this is where we are today.
[01:15:08.840 --> 01:15:09.840]   It's just advertising.
[01:15:09.840 --> 01:15:14.840]   Well, it's based on a deeper data mining than we've ever had.
[01:15:14.840 --> 01:15:16.840]   It's kind of a loaded word.
[01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:17.840]   It is.
[01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:19.840]   That's why they call them cookies.
[01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:21.840]   That's why they call them cookies.
[01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:22.840]   So it sounds nice.
[01:15:22.840 --> 01:15:24.840]   It doesn't like cookies.
[01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:31.840]   Based on the level of data mining that is unprecedented and ungoverned and is sneaking
[01:15:31.840 --> 01:15:38.840]   into aspects of their lives beyond just advertising on a particular site that they're using.
[01:15:38.840 --> 01:15:44.840]   So when you have all of those things, which we currently have, what we need to do is we
[01:15:44.840 --> 01:15:45.840]   need to regulate it.
[01:15:45.840 --> 01:15:49.840]   And maybe people don't get their Facebook feeds, you know, anymore.
[01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:51.840]   Maybe Facebook is not a business.
[01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:53.840]   Facebook is a human right.
[01:15:53.840 --> 01:15:54.840]   I agree.
[01:15:54.840 --> 01:15:59.840]   There are some things human rights that we, that should, regardless of ability to pay,
[01:15:59.840 --> 01:16:01.840]   you should have human rights.
[01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:02.840]   Facebook.
[01:16:02.840 --> 01:16:07.840]   Do you have a right to not have your data used against you without your notes?
[01:16:07.840 --> 01:16:08.840]   Yes.
[01:16:08.840 --> 01:16:09.840]   And you do.
[01:16:09.840 --> 01:16:10.840]   Just do what I do.
[01:16:10.840 --> 01:16:11.840]   What's the other one?
[01:16:11.840 --> 01:16:13.840]   Don't use Facebook.
[01:16:13.840 --> 01:16:19.120]   So what's this notion that everybody ought to get Facebook for free and Facebook shouldn't
[01:16:19.120 --> 01:16:20.920]   have the opportunity to monetize.
[01:16:20.920 --> 01:16:22.080]   They still notion.
[01:16:22.080 --> 01:16:23.080]   That's their business model.
[01:16:23.080 --> 01:16:24.080]   Well, that's right.
[01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:25.080]   You're not the one shifting it.
[01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:26.080]   No, no, that's right.
[01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:27.080]   That's right.
[01:16:27.080 --> 01:16:28.080]   And saying, oh, Facebook shows up at this model.
[01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:29.080]   I don't want that.
[01:16:29.080 --> 01:16:30.080]   I want to charge everybody.
[01:16:30.080 --> 01:16:31.080]   I agree.
[01:16:31.080 --> 01:16:32.080]   They chose it.
[01:16:32.080 --> 01:16:33.080]   They chose it.
[01:16:33.080 --> 01:16:34.080]   But they chose it.
[01:16:34.080 --> 01:16:35.720]   That's a business model.
[01:16:35.720 --> 01:16:39.360]   You have the right to, right now you have, it's still a binary choice.
[01:16:39.360 --> 01:16:41.320]   You can use it or not use it.
[01:16:41.320 --> 01:16:44.400]   And I think more and more people are aware of this as part of the problem is in the past
[01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:47.880]   people perhaps weren't aware of the privacy that they were giving up.
[01:16:47.880 --> 01:16:51.480]   But presuming that they're fully aware now they have a choice.
[01:16:51.480 --> 01:16:56.680]   What about a third choice where you say, I like the services services useful, but I
[01:16:56.680 --> 01:16:59.320]   don't want to be a business model, but that's up to them.
[01:16:59.320 --> 01:17:01.360]   Why do you oppose that upon them?
[01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:02.360]   That's true.
[01:17:02.360 --> 01:17:03.360]   Okay.
[01:17:03.360 --> 01:17:06.120]   Let's, shall we read, shall we have a reading, please, of Ben Thompson's, the treachery on
[01:17:06.120 --> 01:17:11.280]   this, who has an intelligent analysis about Matthew pointed it to me.
[01:17:11.280 --> 01:17:14.240]   Uh, about privacy fundamentalism.
[01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:18.160]   I knew we would get to this because this is a great piece, I think.
[01:17:18.160 --> 01:17:24.280]   Uh, he's a pretty, you know, he's from I something that I know raised Jeff's blood pressure,
[01:17:24.280 --> 01:17:30.320]   which is far-hod Manju's piece on the New York Times privacy project in which he had
[01:17:30.320 --> 01:17:37.960]   people monitoring his, uh, his, his surfing of the net for a few days and, and, and seeing
[01:17:37.960 --> 01:17:44.880]   all the tracking resources from Amazon, Facebook and Google of various trackers on the sites
[01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:45.980]   he visited.
[01:17:45.980 --> 01:17:51.160]   This became an issue for Ben because as you can see, stratecaries in there and there are
[01:17:51.160 --> 01:17:52.720]   a bunch of trackers.
[01:17:52.720 --> 01:17:58.600]   Ben said, which I found odd since I have zero advertising on my site.
[01:17:58.600 --> 01:18:02.880]   So he says it sure looks like I'm up to some devious behavior.
[01:18:02.880 --> 01:18:06.560]   I guess it's all the advertising trackers on my site, which doesn't have any advertising
[01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:12.360]   or perhaps Manju has so often seems to be the case with privacy scare pieces has overstated
[01:18:12.360 --> 01:18:14.520]   their case by a massive degree.
[01:18:14.520 --> 01:18:18.000]   Sorry, let me just applaud that line.
[01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:22.080]   I knew when I read that when I read my mind, my juice piece, I knew that this would be
[01:18:22.080 --> 01:18:23.720]   one of those losing it.
[01:18:23.720 --> 01:18:27.280]   That and Jeffrey Fowler's piece where he tries to buy a banana with two different credit
[01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:28.780]   cards.
[01:18:28.780 --> 01:18:29.880]   Did you read that one?
[01:18:29.880 --> 01:18:33.920]   Uh, Fowler's going to be on the, uh, tech news weekly tomorrow.
[01:18:33.920 --> 01:18:35.160]   So be nice.
[01:18:35.160 --> 01:18:39.680]   We should, we should talk about their coverage of section two, 32 sometime.
[01:18:39.680 --> 01:18:43.280]   Oh, I don't know the banana story.
[01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:44.280]   I would like to.
[01:18:44.280 --> 01:18:46.680]   So he wants to know how much you want to know how much tracking.
[01:18:46.680 --> 01:18:48.080]   Pass the banana story.
[01:18:48.080 --> 01:18:49.080]   All right.
[01:18:49.080 --> 01:18:50.080]   Let's go to the banana story.
[01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:52.240]   We're not going to be in Thompson pocket.
[01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:54.080]   Yeah, I'll go back to Ben Thompson.
[01:18:54.080 --> 01:18:55.080]   Put a pin in that.
[01:18:55.080 --> 01:18:56.080]   We're going to push that on the stack.
[01:18:56.080 --> 01:18:57.320]   Put a pin in Ben Thompson.
[01:18:57.320 --> 01:18:58.320]   Yeah.
[01:18:58.320 --> 01:19:04.400]   Put a pin in Ben Thompson and then go to buying bananas via credit card Jeffrey Fowler's story
[01:19:04.400 --> 01:19:11.720]   in which he says, well, we want to see, as we wanted to see how many, uh, how much information
[01:19:11.720 --> 01:19:15.480]   was gathered with a credit card purchase.
[01:19:15.480 --> 01:19:22.400]   So I went and I bought a banana, one banana with two different credit cards, the, the,
[01:19:22.400 --> 01:19:29.480]   uh, apple card and the Amazon Prime's reward card from Chase Visa, at which point he throws
[01:19:29.480 --> 01:19:33.000]   out the entire banana analogy set because he says there's really no way of figuring
[01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:34.000]   out how much information.
[01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:35.720]   They gathered from that purchase.
[01:19:35.720 --> 01:19:39.600]   So forget I mentioned bananas.
[01:19:39.600 --> 01:19:43.880]   And, and, but here's what we know or we think we know about credit cards gathering and how
[01:19:43.880 --> 01:19:45.720]   that information is shared.
[01:19:45.720 --> 01:19:46.720]   Oh, wait.
[01:19:46.720 --> 01:19:47.960]   It's not even about bananas.
[01:19:47.960 --> 01:19:51.080]   Well, no, it was a good, it was like a good lead for about five.
[01:19:51.080 --> 01:19:52.200]   The banana was a red herring.
[01:19:52.200 --> 01:19:53.200]   It was a red herring.
[01:19:53.200 --> 01:19:54.920]   Look how long the bananas go on.
[01:19:54.920 --> 01:19:59.280]   Like I'm like, like, it was a yellow herring.
[01:19:59.280 --> 01:20:03.920]   So but he does then get into what, you know, and I think this is actually one of those good
[01:20:03.920 --> 01:20:08.800]   informational pieces consumers should read to understand, you know, the kind of information.
[01:20:08.800 --> 01:20:13.640]   And he's, he actually analyzes the privacy policies from the various credit cards.
[01:20:13.640 --> 01:20:21.200]   And it's kind of a, uh, an Ode the apple card in which, uh, shares very little information,
[01:20:21.200 --> 01:20:23.600]   Goldman Sachs, which runs the apple card.
[01:20:23.600 --> 01:20:27.200]   It has been prevented by apple from gathering information.
[01:20:27.200 --> 01:20:28.200]   Oh, yeah.
[01:20:28.200 --> 01:20:29.200]   We trust Goldman Sachs.
[01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:30.200]   Uh huh.
[01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:33.600]   Well, Apple trust maybe, but that Goldman does have to share information with the credit
[01:20:33.600 --> 01:20:40.040]   agencies, but it does not, it says it does not, and Apple says we enforce this share transactions
[01:20:40.040 --> 01:20:45.840]   to marketers or a sister, a sister company of Goldman that mines credit credit.
[01:20:45.840 --> 01:20:47.840]   Oh, nice.
[01:20:47.840 --> 01:20:49.400]   It's very cozy.
[01:20:49.400 --> 01:20:53.960]   Anyway, he says, you know, that's why you want to use the apple card, but, uh, don't
[01:20:53.960 --> 01:20:56.600]   put it in your jeans or your leather wallet.
[01:20:56.600 --> 01:20:58.400]   I haven't my leather wallet right now.
[01:20:58.400 --> 01:20:59.400]   I don't care.
[01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:02.040]   I'm a, I'm a rule breaker.
[01:21:02.040 --> 01:21:07.360]   I take my chances, baby, as long as you have the leather wallet in your denim jeans, two
[01:21:07.360 --> 01:21:09.160]   negative reverses it.
[01:21:09.160 --> 01:21:10.960]   It reverses the polarity.
[01:21:10.960 --> 01:21:11.960]   Yeah.
[01:21:11.960 --> 01:21:15.760]   So, so that's another, Fowler writes a lot of pieces like this, uh, that I'm sure give
[01:21:15.760 --> 01:21:18.200]   Jeff the he be GBS.
[01:21:18.200 --> 01:21:22.100]   So that was the great thing about Ben's piece was that he pointed out that lots of those
[01:21:22.100 --> 01:21:25.920]   tracking pixels, which sounds so, you know, horrible.
[01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:29.640]   One of them like let's him use a specific font.
[01:21:29.640 --> 01:21:31.520]   Like it has nothing to do with tracking your.
[01:21:31.520 --> 01:21:32.520]   Well, it's tight.
[01:21:32.520 --> 01:21:38.080]   Or you're, I have to point out that that information about the visitor does go back to
[01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:39.680]   Microsoft on that.
[01:21:39.680 --> 01:21:44.880]   Uh, Stripe is getting information about the visitor because he uses Stripe to pay for subscriptions.
[01:21:44.880 --> 01:21:48.600]   Cloud front, which is an Amazon cloud front is probably pretty benign.
[01:21:48.600 --> 01:21:53.360]   It's an, it's a basically an Amazon, uh, DDoS protection and a person.
[01:21:53.360 --> 01:21:54.800]   It's a CDN, isn't it?
[01:21:54.800 --> 01:21:55.800]   Sort of.
[01:21:55.800 --> 01:21:56.800]   Yeah.
[01:21:56.800 --> 01:21:57.800]   And we use it to.
[01:21:57.800 --> 01:21:58.800]   Yeah.
[01:21:58.800 --> 01:21:59.800]   And, uh, so I think that's probably benign.
[01:21:59.800 --> 01:22:05.400]   And of course, Farhad treated it as Amazon, but I, well, but who knows?
[01:22:05.400 --> 01:22:07.320]   Maybe information is a Jake.
[01:22:07.320 --> 01:22:13.680]   There's a jQuery file is that I'm just saying, I think his point is that some things are
[01:22:13.680 --> 01:22:17.360]   clearly, I have to point out we use a lot of the same stuff.
[01:22:17.360 --> 01:22:18.360]   We use cloud front.
[01:22:18.360 --> 01:22:20.080]   We use what keep in the web going.
[01:22:20.080 --> 01:22:22.240]   The cookie was invented not to surveil you.
[01:22:22.240 --> 01:22:24.080]   It was invented to keep state.
[01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:25.600]   Well, these aren't all cookies.
[01:22:25.600 --> 01:22:32.080]   Some of these are merely scripts or like or things, but they're all could be used to
[01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:33.480]   track you.
[01:22:33.480 --> 01:22:35.160]   And somebody's also said the same thing to me.
[01:22:35.160 --> 01:22:36.160]   You have 16 trackers.
[01:22:36.160 --> 01:22:37.160]   I use ghostry.
[01:22:37.160 --> 01:22:40.840]   You have 16 trackers on twit and said, yeah, but they're, but they're not ad trackers.
[01:22:40.840 --> 01:22:44.800]   They're things like this, like new relic and Googles analytics and stuff like that.
[01:22:44.800 --> 01:22:50.560]   So there is privacy, fundamentalism and the point that, uh, I think the, the point that
[01:22:50.560 --> 01:22:54.400]   Ben is saying is you don't want.
[01:22:54.400 --> 01:23:00.720]   And this is what you've always said, Jeff, you don't want the perfect to eliminate the
[01:23:00.720 --> 01:23:02.360]   good or something like that.
[01:23:02.360 --> 01:23:05.200]   Well, see the verb could get dangerous.
[01:23:05.200 --> 01:23:06.920]   It could be used for terrible things.
[01:23:06.920 --> 01:23:07.920]   Yeah.
[01:23:07.920 --> 01:23:08.920]   Right.
[01:23:08.920 --> 01:23:14.560]   The point of this article, he says, I will say that on online, I guarantee you there is
[01:23:14.560 --> 01:23:16.960]   someone who is using it.
[01:23:16.960 --> 01:23:18.560]   Yeah, could be used.
[01:23:18.560 --> 01:23:19.560]   Could be used.
[01:23:19.560 --> 01:23:25.720]   I, I do believe like, you know, someone's always going to use a new platform for porn.
[01:23:25.720 --> 01:23:30.400]   Someone is always going to use a benign technology to make money via advertising or data.
[01:23:30.400 --> 01:23:35.640]   My Google, we use Google analytics because we want to know, uh, how many people visit
[01:23:35.640 --> 01:23:36.640]   our page.
[01:23:36.640 --> 01:23:39.800]   Uh, that's useful information for us and which pages they visit.
[01:23:39.800 --> 01:23:44.520]   We're going to put briefly for just a couple of days, a heat map tracker on our page to
[01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:46.200]   see what parts of the page people use.
[01:23:46.200 --> 01:23:49.360]   And look, that's a usability thing for us, but it's a tracker.
[01:23:49.360 --> 01:23:50.360]   And it's a third party.
[01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:56.320]   Uh, so yeah, the thing is, as Ben's pointing out, there are good reasons why I use every
[01:23:56.320 --> 01:23:59.080]   one of these trackers and it's not for advertising.
[01:23:59.080 --> 01:24:03.520]   And I think we should maybe, I don't think the term tracker is a great term for what
[01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:04.720]   you're describing.
[01:24:04.720 --> 01:24:07.440]   There are things that gather data about the user.
[01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:13.120]   But tracking implies that that somehow follows you or that someone is kind of surveilling
[01:24:13.120 --> 01:24:14.120]   you.
[01:24:14.120 --> 01:24:17.480]   If, if, if it's just, hey, what fonts do you have?
[01:24:17.480 --> 01:24:21.120]   So I know whether to serve you one or not, I don't consider that tracking.
[01:24:21.120 --> 01:24:22.120]   That's just.
[01:24:22.120 --> 01:24:26.160]   And yet as Stacy points out, it could be misused as a tracker.
[01:24:26.160 --> 01:24:30.800]   Well, let's, I mean, this, this is where our regulations need to go and we need to elevate
[01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:34.000]   the discussion beyond regulate tech, which is silly.
[01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:37.520]   And think about it more like, Hey, when cars came out, cars were great.
[01:24:37.520 --> 01:24:41.120]   They, well, maybe they weren't so awesome, but they were good.
[01:24:41.120 --> 01:24:46.200]   They got you places and some people were using cars to run over other people or to,
[01:24:46.200 --> 01:24:48.760]   you know, destroy property.
[01:24:48.760 --> 01:24:49.760]   So we built that.
[01:24:49.760 --> 01:24:50.760]   We got to see it.
[01:24:50.760 --> 01:24:55.400]   Yeah, we create laws to solve those problems with tech.
[01:24:55.400 --> 01:25:01.320]   We're still in this weird place where we're like, Oh, we can't regulate technology, but
[01:25:01.320 --> 01:25:02.320]   we can't.
[01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:04.720]   We can regulate the outcomes we don't want.
[01:25:04.720 --> 01:25:09.200]   We just, if we want people's data to be protected, we should create laws that require you to
[01:25:09.200 --> 01:25:10.640]   opt in.
[01:25:10.640 --> 01:25:14.360]   And once we have those laws, yes, some people are going to have to adjust their business
[01:25:14.360 --> 01:25:15.360]   models.
[01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:18.040]   And I'll tell you, Facebook and Google will be fine.
[01:25:18.040 --> 01:25:23.040]   Have we talked about the, let me call the car industry invented the term J walking?
[01:25:23.040 --> 01:25:24.040]   Have we talked about that?
[01:25:24.040 --> 01:25:25.040]   No, but hold on.
[01:25:25.040 --> 01:25:26.040]   I want to get to that.
[01:25:26.040 --> 01:25:28.480]   Put a pin in that one because I have to unpin, Ben.
[01:25:28.480 --> 01:25:31.320]   He's been hanging for a while now.
[01:25:31.320 --> 01:25:33.760]   Let me just wrap up his article.
[01:25:33.760 --> 01:25:37.600]   He says a point of this article is not to argue that companies like Google and Facebook
[01:25:37.600 --> 01:25:42.360]   are in the right and Apple is in the wrong or for that matter to argue myself interest.
[01:25:42.360 --> 01:25:47.520]   The truth, as is so often the case is somewhere in the middle in the gray to that.
[01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:52.400]   I need, I believe the privacy debate needs to be reset around these three assumptions.
[01:25:52.400 --> 01:25:55.560]   This is what I want to run by you guys.
[01:25:55.560 --> 01:25:56.560]   These three assumptions.
[01:25:56.560 --> 01:26:01.320]   One, except that privacy online entails trade offs.
[01:26:01.320 --> 01:26:06.040]   The corollary is an absolutist approach to privacy is a sure fire way to get policy
[01:26:06.040 --> 01:26:11.240]   wrong and incidentally, knock sites like his off the net, right?
[01:26:11.240 --> 01:26:12.600]   Because there's no way to monetize.
[01:26:12.600 --> 01:26:18.360]   Two, keep in mind that the widespread creation and spread of data is inherent to computers
[01:26:18.360 --> 01:26:21.480]   and the internet and that these qualities.
[01:26:21.480 --> 01:26:25.120]   Jeff's been saying this all along have a positive as well as negative implication.
[01:26:25.120 --> 01:26:31.160]   Be aware of what good ideas and positive outcomes are extinguished in the pursuit to
[01:26:31.160 --> 01:26:32.680]   stop out the negative ones.
[01:26:32.680 --> 01:26:34.920]   That's one Jeff's been saying a lot.
[01:26:34.920 --> 01:26:35.920]   Yes.
[01:26:35.920 --> 01:26:36.920]   Yeah.
[01:26:36.920 --> 01:26:37.920]   Yeah.
[01:26:37.920 --> 01:26:40.160]   No, and I think we all agree on that.
[01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:45.040]   It's policy and this is the one I like or I think we should talk about.
[01:26:45.040 --> 01:26:48.120]   Focus policy on the physical and digital divide.
[01:26:48.120 --> 01:26:49.200]   We're just talking about that.
[01:26:49.200 --> 01:26:53.960]   The difference between Facebook's political ads and broadcasts political ads.
[01:26:53.960 --> 01:26:55.520]   Our behavior online is one thing.
[01:26:55.520 --> 01:27:02.720]   We both benefit from the spread of data and should in turn be more wary of those implications.
[01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:06.040]   Making what is offline online is quite another.
[01:27:06.040 --> 01:27:09.400]   So I don't fully understand what he's saying there.
[01:27:09.400 --> 01:27:13.640]   I think that relates to his analogy of the status files.
[01:27:13.640 --> 01:27:14.640]   Yeah.
[01:27:14.640 --> 01:27:18.200]   So the Stasi had all this information in file folders so it was hard to access.
[01:27:18.200 --> 01:27:25.800]   The East German secret police had a million of these miles literally miles of file folders
[01:27:25.800 --> 01:27:28.480]   on East German citizens.
[01:27:28.480 --> 01:27:31.160]   But because it wasn't online, it wasn't as mineable.
[01:27:31.160 --> 01:27:33.960]   It wasn't as big of a hazard, right?
[01:27:33.960 --> 01:27:34.960]   Mm-hmm.
[01:27:34.960 --> 01:27:35.960]   Right.
[01:27:35.960 --> 01:27:36.960]   I think that's it.
[01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:41.680]   Next to that concept of ambient privacy, which is once we start putting all this data online,
[01:27:41.680 --> 01:27:46.240]   it's searchable, accessible, and mineable in ways that it hasn't been before.
[01:27:46.240 --> 01:27:51.800]   And so I think that's a very good point to keep in mind.
[01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:58.040]   It's kind of that drives my reporting on any sort of smart stuff that I'm talking about.
[01:27:58.040 --> 01:27:59.040]   Yeah.
[01:27:59.040 --> 01:28:00.440]   And I think he's got a great point about it.
[01:28:00.440 --> 01:28:05.800]   Look at DNA information so people can upload their DNA info, which is great because they
[01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:07.920]   can find family members that they didn't know about.
[01:28:07.920 --> 01:28:11.280]   They can find out information about their background.
[01:28:11.280 --> 01:28:14.400]   If they were adopted, they can find out if they have health risks that they didn't know
[01:28:14.400 --> 01:28:15.400]   about.
[01:28:15.400 --> 01:28:16.400]   This is all fantastic.
[01:28:16.400 --> 01:28:21.040]   But people can also use that information for all sorts of nefarious purposes.
[01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:23.960]   Well, you have to regulate the knowledge.
[01:28:23.960 --> 01:28:24.960]   You regulate the use.
[01:28:24.960 --> 01:28:25.960]   Right.
[01:28:25.960 --> 01:28:31.720]   That's that to me is key here, is that I worry that data has become a scare word and
[01:28:31.720 --> 01:28:37.320]   that we're going to be in a position where we're going to try to control knowledge,
[01:28:37.320 --> 01:28:39.240]   admit it in black, you know, erase things.
[01:28:39.240 --> 01:28:43.600]   That's why I object to the right to be forgotten and such.
[01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:46.360]   Knowledge in a free society is free.
[01:28:46.360 --> 01:28:50.760]   Misuse of it is about where Stacy is going, it's quite right.
[01:28:50.760 --> 01:28:54.920]   You're then government steps in to protect people's rights against real harm and real
[01:28:54.920 --> 01:28:56.320]   misuse.
[01:28:56.320 --> 01:29:01.760]   But to back to regulate knowledge or even the underlying technology itself is the wrong
[01:29:01.760 --> 01:29:02.760]   way to go.
[01:29:02.760 --> 01:29:03.760]   Right.
[01:29:03.760 --> 01:29:06.800]   This is why when it comes to facial recognition, there was another effort this week.
[01:29:06.800 --> 01:29:09.760]   I forget which politician said, I want to ban it outright.
[01:29:09.760 --> 01:29:13.520]   Well, tell that to families with Alzheimer's patients.
[01:29:13.520 --> 01:29:17.720]   Tell that to the police who do have a legitimate use of it.
[01:29:17.720 --> 01:29:19.560]   Tell that to others.
[01:29:19.560 --> 01:29:26.440]   Some recognition is not inherently bad.
[01:29:26.440 --> 01:29:30.840]   The Stazia shut him off.
[01:29:30.840 --> 01:29:33.480]   Go ahead, Jeff, for your back.
[01:29:33.480 --> 01:29:36.120]   You stopped at inherently bad.
[01:29:36.120 --> 01:29:39.600]   Yeah, we should regulate the use of it.
[01:29:39.600 --> 01:29:41.600]   And I forget now.
[01:29:41.600 --> 01:29:43.600]   And I do think to be honest.
[01:29:43.600 --> 01:29:44.600]   I do.
[01:29:44.600 --> 01:29:45.600]   Partially to blame for this.
[01:29:45.600 --> 01:29:46.600]   Skype works.
[01:29:46.600 --> 01:29:47.600]   Where are you?
[01:29:47.600 --> 01:29:48.600]   I got, I got skyped.
[01:29:48.600 --> 01:29:57.200]   Like, because they've turned their four years, their rallying cry was, don't regulate technology,
[01:29:57.200 --> 01:29:58.200]   just broadly.
[01:29:58.200 --> 01:30:05.960]   So that's why we're talking about data so broadly because we haven't been forced to
[01:30:05.960 --> 01:30:09.440]   articulate what we mean when we're talking about technology.
[01:30:09.440 --> 01:30:13.040]   And the tech industry has benefited hugely from that because we've steered clear from
[01:30:13.040 --> 01:30:17.640]   it because it was a job creation engine, because it was making money.
[01:30:17.640 --> 01:30:20.760]   And we were worried about stifling innovation.
[01:30:20.760 --> 01:30:24.720]   And it's time now that, I mean, that's, we're all putting our skepticism glasses back on
[01:30:24.720 --> 01:30:28.440]   or taking off our rose, rose colored eyeglasses.
[01:30:28.440 --> 01:30:30.040]   There's something about that.
[01:30:30.040 --> 01:30:35.960]   And we're saying, oh, hey, we need to regulate the use of data, but we still haven't had
[01:30:35.960 --> 01:30:40.280]   that we haven't developed the vocabulary for having these policy discussions yet.
[01:30:40.280 --> 01:30:41.280]   I don't think.
[01:30:41.280 --> 01:30:47.600]   And I think it is totally the fault or partly the fault of Facebook and Twitter and Google
[01:30:47.600 --> 01:30:53.960]   Mark Zuckerberg admitted in an interview that for the first 10 years, all he did was think
[01:30:53.960 --> 01:30:58.320]   about the positive aspects of connecting people together around the globe.
[01:30:58.320 --> 01:31:03.920]   So they had nobody thinking about the negative aspects until everyone got mad at them about
[01:31:03.920 --> 01:31:05.600]   an election and Russian trolls.
[01:31:05.600 --> 01:31:11.400]   Like, you know, thousands and thousands of PhDs couldn't spend even 10 minutes thinking
[01:31:11.400 --> 01:31:16.800]   about what could happen to your data, what could, if they allowed everybody to use it,
[01:31:16.800 --> 01:31:20.280]   you know, could someone use it for something bad?
[01:31:20.280 --> 01:31:26.720]   The best thing about wearing rose colored glasses is that all the flags, red flags,
[01:31:26.720 --> 01:31:28.720]   just look like flags.
[01:31:28.720 --> 01:31:31.680]   Oh, that was nice.
[01:31:31.680 --> 01:31:32.680]   It took me a while.
[01:31:32.680 --> 01:31:34.680]   But yeah, not as long as it took me.
[01:31:34.680 --> 01:31:40.480]   It took me a while to get there.
[01:31:40.480 --> 01:31:45.200]   So why, why did the auto industry invent jaywalking?
[01:31:45.200 --> 01:31:47.000]   So this is a fascinating story.
[01:31:47.000 --> 01:31:51.280]   So it was a marketing campaign to try and get people to stop stepping out in front of
[01:31:51.280 --> 01:31:54.720]   cars because they kept hitting people.
[01:31:54.720 --> 01:31:55.720]   Yeah.
[01:31:55.720 --> 01:31:56.720]   And people were like, cars are bad.
[01:31:56.720 --> 01:31:58.080]   They hit people.
[01:31:58.080 --> 01:32:05.640]   But if you look at old video of people walking around New York or Paris or London before cars
[01:32:05.640 --> 01:32:09.560]   were dominant, they literally just wander wherever they want.
[01:32:09.560 --> 01:32:12.920]   And cars are like looking and running out of the way.
[01:32:12.920 --> 01:32:18.360]   And so the car industry came up with this campaign to convince people that walking out
[01:32:18.360 --> 01:32:20.800]   in front of cars was bad.
[01:32:20.800 --> 01:32:26.920]   Instead of maybe designing roads or streets or cities in a different way to accommodate
[01:32:26.920 --> 01:32:30.480]   people walking, it was cars are more important.
[01:32:30.480 --> 01:32:35.360]   And therefore, if you step out and the J came from crazy as a J bird, I think was the term
[01:32:35.360 --> 01:32:36.360]   at the time.
[01:32:36.360 --> 01:32:37.360]   Oh, I love it.
[01:32:37.360 --> 01:32:40.920]   You're crazy as a J bird walking out in front of that car.
[01:32:40.920 --> 01:32:46.920]   You know, I think the self-driving vehicle industry should take a page from that book
[01:32:46.920 --> 01:32:51.760]   because we need to find a new way to get people from walking in front of cars.
[01:32:51.760 --> 01:32:57.920]   Right after we talked about Anthony Levendowski and his indictment, the New Yorker published
[01:32:57.920 --> 01:33:03.960]   a piece from Charles Duhigg how the Anthony Levendowski indictment helps big tech stifle
[01:33:03.960 --> 01:33:07.280]   innovation in Silicon Valley.
[01:33:07.280 --> 01:33:13.400]   Now, his contention is all innovation comes from intellectual property theft.
[01:33:13.400 --> 01:33:15.520]   Much of the history of innovation is the history of theft.
[01:33:15.520 --> 01:33:19.120]   Microsoft stole the basic idea for the GUI from Apple.
[01:33:19.120 --> 01:33:20.960]   Apple stole it from Xerox.
[01:33:20.960 --> 01:33:24.840]   The research of Xerox probably stole it from somebody else.
[01:33:24.840 --> 01:33:29.960]   He says these large tech companies are worried they might be on the wrong side of the per
[01:33:29.960 --> 01:33:33.280]   loinar dynamic going forward.
[01:33:33.280 --> 01:33:35.440]   So now they're issuing to workers a basic threat.
[01:33:35.440 --> 01:33:40.160]   If you leave and join a competitor, we're going to come after you for stealing our secrets.
[01:33:40.160 --> 01:33:43.640]   So that's an interesting dissenting point of view on this.
[01:33:43.640 --> 01:33:49.520]   That is a hot take if I have ever seen it.
[01:33:49.520 --> 01:33:53.160]   To Tuesdays indictment is drawing mixed reviews in Silicon Valley, Duhigg.
[01:33:53.160 --> 01:33:54.160]   Right.
[01:33:54.160 --> 01:33:57.720]   Somewhere delighted by the possibility that Levendowski could be sent to prison.
[01:33:57.720 --> 01:34:02.480]   He had clearly taken files from Google he wasn't supposed to take and he is widely disliked
[01:34:02.480 --> 01:34:05.000]   by his former colleagues.
[01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:09.000]   Former co-worker told Duhigg, he's one of the most coin operated people I've ever met.
[01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:10.800]   He just goes wherever they pay him the most.
[01:34:10.800 --> 01:34:11.800]   I love that.
[01:34:11.800 --> 01:34:15.840]   Others have been put off by his extracurricular activities such as the founding of a church
[01:34:15.840 --> 01:34:17.760]   called The Way of the Future.
[01:34:17.760 --> 01:34:24.480]   I guess devoted to the realization of acceptance, worship of a Godhead based on artificial intelligence.
[01:34:24.480 --> 01:34:26.640]   For God, he was behind that.
[01:34:26.640 --> 01:34:30.200]   Clearly not been reading most of the stories.
[01:34:30.200 --> 01:34:33.200]   For God, he was behind that.
[01:34:33.200 --> 01:34:35.120]   That's usually as clause lately.
[01:34:35.120 --> 01:34:40.200]   Levendowski is in many ways a perfect mirror of the valley's worst instincts and so like
[01:34:40.200 --> 01:34:45.360]   many perfect mirrors, folks are happy to see him get broken if it means they no longer
[01:34:45.360 --> 01:34:47.000]   have to suffer the glare.
[01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:50.000]   There you go.
[01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:51.000]   Charles Duhigg.
[01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:54.440]   I mean, Apple did steal that stuff from Xerox.
[01:34:54.440 --> 01:34:55.440]   Not really.
[01:34:55.440 --> 01:34:57.080]   Apple kind of borrowed it.
[01:34:57.080 --> 01:34:58.080]   They licensed it.
[01:34:58.080 --> 01:35:00.000]   Didn't they pay a license fee?
[01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:01.760]   Later they did.
[01:35:01.760 --> 01:35:02.760]   Later.
[01:35:02.760 --> 01:35:05.480]   But again, we wouldn't have windows.
[01:35:05.480 --> 01:35:06.480]   We wouldn't have macaducts.
[01:35:06.480 --> 01:35:09.640]   We wouldn't have gooeys if they hadn't.
[01:35:09.640 --> 01:35:12.400]   Xerox did say that's what that stuff was.
[01:35:12.400 --> 01:35:14.200]   It was a research issue.
[01:35:14.200 --> 01:35:16.880]   They weren't trying to make a fortune.
[01:35:16.880 --> 01:35:25.600]   The best part of that story which I think it was Bill Atkinson told us this on triangulation
[01:35:25.600 --> 01:35:32.440]   was that Andy Hertzfeld saw stuff at Xerox and misunderstood what they were doing with
[01:35:32.440 --> 01:35:35.720]   regard to overlapping windows.
[01:35:35.720 --> 01:35:40.840]   As a result wrote that as part of the Macintosh operating system, when the Xerox engineers
[01:35:40.840 --> 01:35:44.600]   saw it, they said, "Wow, we never did that.
[01:35:44.600 --> 01:35:46.080]   We couldn't figure out a way to do that.
[01:35:46.080 --> 01:35:48.680]   That's impressive."
[01:35:48.680 --> 01:35:50.240]   That's how innovation happens, right?
[01:35:50.240 --> 01:35:55.760]   It's a mix of stealing and inventing.
[01:35:55.760 --> 01:35:58.880]   Mickey Mouse wasn't the first mouse to steer a steamship.
[01:35:58.880 --> 01:35:59.880]   Let's just face it.
[01:35:59.880 --> 01:36:00.880]   Don't start with the lion.
[01:36:00.880 --> 01:36:01.880]   It's a whole notion of pop.
[01:36:01.880 --> 01:36:02.880]   The lion king is Hamlet.
[01:36:02.880 --> 01:36:03.880]   Well, but there's another lion.
[01:36:03.880 --> 01:36:11.960]   You can't really rip off Shakespeare.
[01:36:11.960 --> 01:36:12.960]   Okay.
[01:36:12.960 --> 01:36:16.080]   And the character's name is Kimba or something.
[01:36:16.080 --> 01:36:17.080]   Kimba.
[01:36:17.080 --> 01:36:18.080]   Literally.
[01:36:18.080 --> 01:36:19.080]   Exactly.
[01:36:19.080 --> 01:36:20.080]   It's Kimba.
[01:36:20.080 --> 01:36:23.120]   There's another film with a lion king named Kimba.
[01:36:23.120 --> 01:36:24.960]   There's a young lion and his dad.
[01:36:24.960 --> 01:36:27.120]   There's a lion with his older lion with a scar.
[01:36:27.120 --> 01:36:28.120]   It's still Hamlet.
[01:36:28.120 --> 01:36:32.800]   Yeah, it's still Hamlet.
[01:36:32.800 --> 01:36:34.360]   Shakespeare ripped off lots of stuff too.
[01:36:34.360 --> 01:36:35.360]   Come on.
[01:36:35.360 --> 01:36:36.360]   Let's be honest.
[01:36:36.360 --> 01:36:38.000]   Get a case in the public domain.
[01:36:38.000 --> 01:36:45.120]   We didn't get to a sense of property until the statute of Ann in 1705, the only thing that
[01:36:45.120 --> 01:36:52.000]   existed before copyright was licenses where the government, the king, the bishop would
[01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:56.440]   give you the license to be the only one who could print or the only one who could write
[01:36:56.440 --> 01:36:58.760]   about this or the only one who could do that.
[01:36:58.760 --> 01:37:01.840]   There was no notion of owning copyright.
[01:37:01.840 --> 01:37:10.280]   The notion of intellectual property as property is a relatively recent innovation or lack
[01:37:10.280 --> 01:37:11.280]   thereof.
[01:37:11.280 --> 01:37:14.720]   A lot of people think it's a bad idea.
[01:37:14.720 --> 01:37:21.120]   The idea though was to reward innovation without stifling future innovations.
[01:37:21.120 --> 01:37:25.680]   So the whole idea of patent is publish it.
[01:37:25.680 --> 01:37:29.800]   You own it for a limited period of time so you can profit from your invention, but then
[01:37:29.800 --> 01:37:31.440]   others can build upon your invention.
[01:37:31.440 --> 01:37:32.440]   That seems sensible.
[01:37:32.440 --> 01:37:39.480]   But unfortunately, the copyright maximalists have extended the period for so long.
[01:37:39.480 --> 01:37:41.680]   Taking money is literally the only thing that occurs.
[01:37:41.680 --> 01:37:44.880]   There is apps and Larry Lessick has talked about this quite a bit.
[01:37:44.880 --> 01:37:51.120]   There's a lot of value in the common from stealing ideas, from taking grims fairy tales
[01:37:51.120 --> 01:37:53.200]   and making Cinderella.
[01:37:53.200 --> 01:37:57.480]   And that's why the term intellectual property is fundamentally a bad idea.
[01:37:57.480 --> 01:37:58.480]   It's a bad term.
[01:37:58.480 --> 01:38:00.040]   It should not be used.
[01:38:00.040 --> 01:38:01.040]   Yeah.
[01:38:01.040 --> 01:38:02.040]   It's not.
[01:38:02.040 --> 01:38:04.960]   And of course, we live ironically in a world where your actual property, like your phone,
[01:38:04.960 --> 01:38:06.760]   isn't your really property.
[01:38:06.760 --> 01:38:09.360]   And your books aren't your property either.
[01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:11.080]   Yeah, it's very confusing.
[01:38:11.080 --> 01:38:12.600]   And your tractor.
[01:38:12.600 --> 01:38:15.720]   Do not bring your property into or out of the United States.
[01:38:15.720 --> 01:38:20.280]   US border officials are really getting aggressive.
[01:38:20.280 --> 01:38:22.640]   Zach Whitaker writing in tech crunch.
[01:38:22.640 --> 01:38:24.200]   They're coming after my people.
[01:38:24.200 --> 01:38:26.200]   They're coming after your people.
[01:38:26.200 --> 01:38:28.200]   This is a bright thing.
[01:38:28.200 --> 01:38:29.200]   This is bad.
[01:38:29.200 --> 01:38:33.640]   The last year, the CPP searched 30,000 travelers' devices.
[01:38:33.640 --> 01:38:38.600]   It's a 400% increase since 2015.
[01:38:38.600 --> 01:38:44.640]   And the real issue is that they are stopping people for the flimsiest of reasons.
[01:38:44.640 --> 01:38:46.680]   He talks about his friends stuff.
[01:38:46.680 --> 01:38:52.120]   Yeah, his male, a Jawi, who's 17 years old, was coming into the United States and Boston
[01:38:52.120 --> 01:38:55.360]   to attend Harvard as a freshman.
[01:38:55.360 --> 01:38:57.600]   He's a Palestinian national living in Lebanon.
[01:38:57.600 --> 01:39:06.000]   He was denied entry because he had WhatsApp posts from friends, his friends' social media
[01:39:06.000 --> 01:39:07.000]   activity.
[01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:12.120]   And it wasn't terrorist activity, just they don't like the US.
[01:39:12.120 --> 01:39:16.080]   Which by the way, I think we're allowed to say that, right?
[01:39:16.080 --> 01:39:18.880]   Apparently not.
[01:39:18.880 --> 01:39:20.880]   Be careful, Matthew.
[01:39:20.880 --> 01:39:22.400]   Yeah, you'd be careful.
[01:39:22.400 --> 01:39:29.360]   I feel like on my Twitter stream, I'm not getting into the US.
[01:39:29.360 --> 01:39:35.600]   Here's a bit of a US immigration form describing why a traveler was denied entry to the US.
[01:39:35.600 --> 01:39:38.320]   They're asking him about some stuff on his WhatsApp.
[01:39:38.320 --> 01:39:40.040]   The guy says, "It was broadcast on WhatsApp.
[01:39:40.040 --> 01:39:41.040]   I received news.
[01:39:41.040 --> 01:39:42.040]   I don't have anything to do with these.
[01:39:42.040 --> 01:39:43.040]   They came to my app."
[01:39:43.040 --> 01:39:45.040]   So that's an interesting point.
[01:39:45.040 --> 01:39:49.480]   So WhatsApp, someone can create a group and add you to it and then send you a bunch of
[01:39:49.480 --> 01:39:51.480]   stuff and you have no control over that.
[01:39:51.480 --> 01:39:53.640]   They said, "When did you receive the photos on WhatsApp?
[01:39:53.640 --> 01:39:54.640]   I don't know.
[01:39:54.640 --> 01:39:57.360]   Do you understand the concerns of the United States and its citizens when considering the
[01:39:57.360 --> 01:39:59.720]   graphic nature of the images on your cell phone?"
[01:39:59.720 --> 01:40:00.720]   Of course, I understand.
[01:40:00.720 --> 01:40:02.480]   No one finds the graphic pictures pleasant.
[01:40:02.480 --> 01:40:03.480]   It's inhuman.
[01:40:03.480 --> 01:40:06.480]   Have you ever had military weapons training anywhere in the world?
[01:40:06.480 --> 01:40:07.480]   No.
[01:40:07.480 --> 01:40:11.120]   Finally, considering the totality of this interview and the content on your cell phone, you have
[01:40:11.120 --> 01:40:15.600]   been found inadmissible to the United States, you will be removed on the next available
[01:40:15.600 --> 01:40:16.600]   flight.
[01:40:16.600 --> 01:40:17.600]   Boom.
[01:40:17.600 --> 01:40:18.600]   That's it.
[01:40:18.600 --> 01:40:21.320]   Any was going to Harvard or something, wasn't he?
[01:40:21.320 --> 01:40:22.320]   Yes.
[01:40:22.320 --> 01:40:23.320]   This is Harvard freshman.
[01:40:23.320 --> 01:40:24.320]   This is bad.
[01:40:24.320 --> 01:40:31.280]   And this is happening more and more particularly to students from Arab and Muslim countries.
[01:40:31.280 --> 01:40:33.280]   It's bad friends, universities too.
[01:40:33.280 --> 01:40:34.280]   But to Harvard say, yeah.
[01:40:34.280 --> 01:40:37.200]   I would say, what did Harvard say in response to this?
[01:40:37.200 --> 01:40:39.800]   Harvard has not said anything yet.
[01:40:39.800 --> 01:40:40.880]   Okay.
[01:40:40.880 --> 01:40:41.960]   I imagine it will.
[01:40:41.960 --> 01:40:42.960]   I mean, this is not a good...
[01:40:42.960 --> 01:40:43.960]   I sure hope so.
[01:40:43.960 --> 01:40:44.960]   I hope so.
[01:40:44.960 --> 01:40:45.960]   It's not good for them.
[01:40:45.960 --> 01:40:51.040]   What the claim is, is this is a backdoor Muslim ban.
[01:40:51.040 --> 01:40:55.640]   For the Muslim ban that the president tried to institute was told that's not legal.
[01:40:55.640 --> 01:40:58.480]   You can't block people because of their religion.
[01:40:58.480 --> 01:41:03.320]   However, they found another way.
[01:41:03.320 --> 01:41:07.000]   There were some nuns from Canada, I think, that were denied nuns.
[01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:08.000]   And they...
[01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:10.560]   Because they had videos where people were speaking in Arabic.
[01:41:10.560 --> 01:41:13.880]   Like they were just talking, I think it was recipes or something.
[01:41:13.880 --> 01:41:18.320]   But the border patrol was, well, you've got Arabic videos.
[01:41:18.320 --> 01:41:21.400]   You really, if you're coming in the United States, and this does not, it doesn't matter
[01:41:21.400 --> 01:41:23.280]   if you're a US citizen or not.
[01:41:23.280 --> 01:41:27.400]   If you're coming in the United States, you really probably should wipe your devices because
[01:41:27.400 --> 01:41:28.960]   you don't...
[01:41:28.960 --> 01:41:32.920]   I can't control what's on my Twitter feed.
[01:41:32.920 --> 01:41:36.880]   I don't know what's going to be on there when I try to cross the border.
[01:41:36.880 --> 01:41:41.160]   Might be somebody saying, I don't like what's going on in America, shocking.
[01:41:41.160 --> 01:41:42.880]   That's why I think there's got to be...
[01:41:42.880 --> 01:41:45.680]   Someone should set up a service where you get a burner Chromebook.
[01:41:45.680 --> 01:41:46.680]   Yeah.
[01:41:46.680 --> 01:41:48.680]   They're phone, you know.
[01:41:48.680 --> 01:41:49.680]   You can do that.
[01:41:49.680 --> 01:41:51.480]   They did that for a while when they were promoting Chromebooks.
[01:41:51.480 --> 01:41:53.560]   You can use to be able to get one at the airport and...
[01:41:53.560 --> 01:41:54.560]   You're rent one, yeah.
[01:41:54.560 --> 01:41:55.560]   You're rent one.
[01:41:55.560 --> 01:41:56.560]   That's going to be it.
[01:41:56.560 --> 01:41:57.560]   That's going to be it.
[01:41:57.560 --> 01:41:58.560]   Yeah.
[01:41:58.560 --> 01:42:02.880]   Anyway, that was more of a public service announcement.
[01:42:02.880 --> 01:42:04.720]   Are you ready to do the change log, Carson?
[01:42:04.720 --> 01:42:06.120]   Do you have the Trumpeters?
[01:42:06.120 --> 01:42:08.120]   Bring them in.
[01:42:08.120 --> 01:42:10.240]   What the drummers?
[01:42:10.240 --> 01:42:12.680]   Okay, the drummers, they never stop smoking.
[01:42:12.680 --> 01:42:14.680]   You know drummers.
[01:42:14.680 --> 01:42:18.920]   Now, ladies and gentlemen, the newest stuff from Google.
[01:42:18.920 --> 01:42:24.400]   Google Maps is now going to let you combine transit directions with biking directions.
[01:42:24.400 --> 01:42:32.120]   What's shocking and ride sharing multi-modal Google Maps?
[01:42:32.120 --> 01:42:35.880]   You'll input your destination, tap the transit tab, and then you'll get some choices and you
[01:42:35.880 --> 01:42:36.880]   can make...
[01:42:36.880 --> 01:42:38.280]   This is CityMapper's been doing this for years.
[01:42:38.280 --> 01:42:39.280]   I've used...
[01:42:39.280 --> 01:42:41.880]   Oh, I have an app called Transit that I use for that.
[01:42:41.880 --> 01:42:42.880]   Yeah.
[01:42:42.880 --> 01:42:45.480]   So you can have Uber, you can have Lyft.
[01:42:45.480 --> 01:42:47.040]   You can actually...
[01:42:47.040 --> 01:42:48.040]   Convenient.
[01:42:48.040 --> 01:42:52.720]   There's a little book of Lyft.
[01:42:52.720 --> 01:42:53.720]   If you want.
[01:42:53.720 --> 01:42:54.720]   There's a little button.
[01:42:54.720 --> 01:42:57.240]   It says book of Uber, book of Lyft.
[01:42:57.240 --> 01:43:03.240]   So this is in addition to the new transit crowdedness predictions that they put in there.
[01:43:03.240 --> 01:43:04.240]   That's a good one.
[01:43:04.240 --> 01:43:05.240]   Yeah.
[01:43:05.240 --> 01:43:06.240]   Yeah.
[01:43:06.240 --> 01:43:07.240]   Uber...
[01:43:07.240 --> 01:43:12.400]   So they can, in New York, they can say, "Never take the M after all."
[01:43:12.400 --> 01:43:13.400]   Yeah.
[01:43:13.400 --> 01:43:15.800]   Never take the M after 4 p.m.
[01:43:15.800 --> 01:43:19.200]   Google, I don't know if you ever use this Google Hire.
[01:43:19.200 --> 01:43:21.120]   Are you familiar with this?
[01:43:21.120 --> 01:43:22.120]   They're shutting it down.
[01:43:22.120 --> 01:43:24.560]   I never even realized they have this.
[01:43:24.560 --> 01:43:25.560]   I know.
[01:43:25.560 --> 01:43:26.560]   I didn't even know it existed.
[01:43:26.560 --> 01:43:29.600]   There was something called Google Hire.
[01:43:29.600 --> 01:43:33.440]   It was a job application tracking system about two years old.
[01:43:33.440 --> 01:43:35.760]   This was to simplify the hiring process.
[01:43:35.760 --> 01:43:37.520]   I remember us talking about this.
[01:43:37.520 --> 01:43:44.200]   G Suite built for a small to medium businesses, $200 to $400 a month.
[01:43:44.200 --> 01:43:50.280]   This came from an acquisition Google made of Bebop, which I guess did something similar.
[01:43:50.280 --> 01:43:51.280]   So...
[01:43:51.280 --> 01:43:52.280]   What was...
[01:43:52.280 --> 01:43:53.280]   Bebop.
[01:43:53.280 --> 01:43:54.280]   There's a sensor.
[01:43:54.280 --> 01:43:57.080]   There's a time machine.
[01:43:57.080 --> 01:44:01.600]   So they shut that down, but they still have five different messaging apps.
[01:44:01.600 --> 01:44:03.040]   One of them's got a work, Matthew.
[01:44:03.040 --> 01:44:05.560]   Actually, there is news in that RCS store.
[01:44:05.560 --> 01:44:08.680]   I think Google is going to start providing an RCS server.
[01:44:08.680 --> 01:44:13.560]   So if your phone company doesn't, which many refuse to do, doesn't matter, you can use
[01:44:13.560 --> 01:44:20.160]   RCS through Google, which makes Google's messaging more like WhatsApp, more a standalone
[01:44:20.160 --> 01:44:22.480]   not dependent on the carrier service.
[01:44:22.480 --> 01:44:27.760]   And Google seems to want to balance, have a balancing act, not offend the carriers too
[01:44:27.760 --> 01:44:28.760]   much.
[01:44:28.760 --> 01:44:30.240]   Wait, does that mean...
[01:44:30.240 --> 01:44:31.400]   Hold on.
[01:44:31.400 --> 01:44:37.600]   Does that mean I will stop seeing the so-and-so liked this text in my group text as people
[01:44:37.600 --> 01:44:38.600]   on iPhones?
[01:44:38.600 --> 01:44:39.600]   No, well...
[01:44:39.600 --> 01:44:40.600]   No, no...
[01:44:40.600 --> 01:44:43.760]   No, you're still going to see that.
[01:44:43.760 --> 01:44:44.760]   Yeah.
[01:44:44.760 --> 01:44:45.760]   Okay.
[01:44:45.760 --> 01:44:46.760]   Really, that's all I care about.
[01:44:46.760 --> 01:44:47.760]   So moving on.
[01:44:47.760 --> 01:44:54.160]   Well, it will, if at some point people stop using Apple's messages and start using Google
[01:44:54.160 --> 01:44:55.160]   RCS.
[01:44:55.160 --> 01:44:57.400]   I think that's going to happen.
[01:44:57.400 --> 01:45:00.400]   It's going to happen.
[01:45:00.400 --> 01:45:03.520]   Rich communications services.
[01:45:03.520 --> 01:45:10.000]   I was depressed when I found out my kids care more about whether the bubble is green than
[01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:12.720]   about what system they're using.
[01:45:12.720 --> 01:45:13.960]   Is that for real?
[01:45:13.960 --> 01:45:16.960]   I had a friend tell me that once and I swear to God I thought the original.
[01:45:16.960 --> 01:45:19.880]   Oh yeah, Henry, my son.
[01:45:19.880 --> 01:45:24.560]   Everybody in the front and iPhone, except for one poor kid who had an Android phone,
[01:45:24.560 --> 01:45:28.960]   they couldn't include him in group messages so he just wouldn't get invited to parties.
[01:45:28.960 --> 01:45:33.560]   Wait, so he doesn't get included because it doesn't work or just they don't like the
[01:45:33.560 --> 01:45:34.560]   bubble?
[01:45:34.560 --> 01:45:35.560]   No, because...
[01:45:35.560 --> 01:45:36.560]   No, well, I mean...
[01:45:36.560 --> 01:45:38.400]   Is there only sending a Thai message?
[01:45:38.400 --> 01:45:43.280]   They can only do the group message from my message so because he's a green bubble he's
[01:45:43.280 --> 01:45:44.440]   left out.
[01:45:44.440 --> 01:45:47.800]   But that really adds to the overall feeling that you don't want to be...
[01:45:47.800 --> 01:45:49.720]   I mean, that's happened to people in my family.
[01:45:49.720 --> 01:45:50.720]   Sure.
[01:45:50.720 --> 01:45:51.720]   Not kids.
[01:45:51.720 --> 01:45:52.720]   Oh no, then I'm getting in.
[01:45:52.720 --> 01:45:53.720]   I don't want to go to group.
[01:45:53.720 --> 01:45:54.720]   No, no, you're going to...
[01:45:54.720 --> 01:46:00.720]   No, she's going into therapy in 20 years and I'm going to blame you for that.
[01:46:00.720 --> 01:46:01.720]   Nice.
[01:46:01.720 --> 01:46:06.720]   This is a big deal for kids at her age.
[01:46:06.720 --> 01:46:07.720]   Absolutely.
[01:46:07.720 --> 01:46:09.400]   I can't get invited to anything.
[01:46:09.400 --> 01:46:12.800]   But you need to ask her because who knows what's going on in Seattle schools?
[01:46:12.800 --> 01:46:14.400]   There may be more Android phones.
[01:46:14.400 --> 01:46:15.400]   Yeah, it could be all Android phones.
[01:46:15.400 --> 01:46:16.400]   She's the new kid.
[01:46:16.400 --> 01:46:18.400]   No, she's actually...
[01:46:18.400 --> 01:46:21.240]   She's one of four new kids in a class of 15.
[01:46:21.240 --> 01:46:22.240]   She's fine.
[01:46:22.240 --> 01:46:23.240]   Ask her.
[01:46:23.240 --> 01:46:27.480]   Just do a quick survey what kinds of funds people have.
[01:46:27.480 --> 01:46:32.400]   If more than 75% have iPhones, you're getting an iPhone instead of a Pixel.
[01:46:32.400 --> 01:46:35.120]   When our daughter was 14, she wanted a blackberry.
[01:46:35.120 --> 01:46:37.720]   She didn't even know what they were because of BBM.
[01:46:37.720 --> 01:46:38.720]   That's all she wanted.
[01:46:38.720 --> 01:46:39.720]   Yeah, BBM.
[01:46:39.720 --> 01:46:40.720]   And you know what?
[01:46:40.720 --> 01:46:41.720]   That's completely legitimate.
[01:46:41.720 --> 01:46:45.720]   That was patriotic, Matthew.
[01:46:45.720 --> 01:46:47.560]   She didn't even know what was happening.
[01:46:47.560 --> 01:46:50.440]   She was like, "I want whatever BBM is."
[01:46:50.440 --> 01:46:52.560]   What's that thing with the BBM on it?
[01:46:52.560 --> 01:46:54.600]   Speaking of transit, Google has...
[01:46:54.600 --> 01:46:55.600]   I didn't know this.
[01:46:55.600 --> 01:46:56.600]   Ways for...
[01:46:56.600 --> 01:46:58.880]   Have you used this, Jeff, for New York City Public Transit?
[01:46:58.880 --> 01:47:01.040]   No, it's a crowd sourcing thing.
[01:47:01.040 --> 01:47:02.040]   Pigeon.
[01:47:02.040 --> 01:47:03.040]   Pigeon.
[01:47:03.040 --> 01:47:04.040]   And now expanding beyond the subways.
[01:47:04.040 --> 01:47:05.040]   Pigeon.
[01:47:05.040 --> 01:47:06.960]   And it's going to all New York Transit services.
[01:47:06.960 --> 01:47:07.960]   So you haven't used Pigeon?
[01:47:07.960 --> 01:47:08.960]   No, I'm not.
[01:47:08.960 --> 01:47:09.960]   I didn't know about it.
[01:47:09.960 --> 01:47:11.680]   Well, it works on the path.
[01:47:11.680 --> 01:47:12.960]   So that's what your train is, right?
[01:47:12.960 --> 01:47:14.880]   Why take path as a civilized...
[01:47:14.880 --> 01:47:19.280]   As of Wednesday, it can compass the city buses and ferries Metro North along Island
[01:47:19.280 --> 01:47:22.920]   Railroad, New Jersey Transit and the path train.
[01:47:22.920 --> 01:47:25.360]   In fact, I should install it right now.
[01:47:25.360 --> 01:47:27.880]   Pigeon, put Pigeon on now.
[01:47:27.880 --> 01:47:32.320]   They're going to expand Pigeon to San Francisco and Chicago later this year.
[01:47:32.320 --> 01:47:35.240]   It's like ways in the sense that it's crowd sourced information.
[01:47:35.240 --> 01:47:39.160]   So if you're stuck on a train, you could say, "Hey, there's a delay," or it's too crowded
[01:47:39.160 --> 01:47:46.800]   or something just barfed in the third carriage, or there's a busker with BO in carriage too.
[01:47:46.800 --> 01:47:47.800]   That kind of thing.
[01:47:47.800 --> 01:47:49.040]   So it comes from actual pigeons, I think.
[01:47:49.040 --> 01:47:52.600]   Yeah, there's a Pigeon in carriage four.
[01:47:52.600 --> 01:47:53.880]   Got transmitters.
[01:47:53.880 --> 01:47:57.320]   There's a dead Pigeon in carriage five.
[01:47:57.320 --> 01:48:01.800]   The one rule when I went to New York was never get on an empty car.
[01:48:01.800 --> 01:48:02.800]   That's right.
[01:48:02.800 --> 01:48:04.800]   Because there's a reason that the new train...
[01:48:04.800 --> 01:48:05.800]   There's the reason.
[01:48:05.800 --> 01:48:06.800]   The other rule in New York?
[01:48:06.800 --> 01:48:07.800]   Yeah.
[01:48:07.800 --> 01:48:09.800]   Never hug an Elmo.
[01:48:09.800 --> 01:48:11.800]   Oh, God, don't even touch an Elmo.
[01:48:11.800 --> 01:48:12.800]   You don't know what's in that.
[01:48:12.800 --> 01:48:13.800]   Never.
[01:48:13.800 --> 01:48:14.800]   I don't.
[01:48:14.800 --> 01:48:15.800]   I went to someone hug an Elmo.
[01:48:15.800 --> 01:48:16.800]   Well, it was the wrong time square.
[01:48:16.800 --> 01:48:18.560]   We tell you how small children?
[01:48:18.560 --> 01:48:19.560]   Yeah.
[01:48:19.560 --> 01:48:22.880]   Oh, I hugged an Elmo once, but I was at Universal Studios.
[01:48:22.880 --> 01:48:23.880]   So it was after that.
[01:48:23.880 --> 01:48:24.880]   That's okay there.
[01:48:24.880 --> 01:48:25.880]   It was a clean Elmo.
[01:48:25.880 --> 01:48:28.320]   Those Elmo's are sanitized for your potential.
[01:48:28.320 --> 01:48:30.320]   Elmo's in time square.
[01:48:30.320 --> 01:48:31.320]   Oh, yeah.
[01:48:31.320 --> 01:48:33.520]   I would never hug an unlicensed minion.
[01:48:33.520 --> 01:48:34.520]   Oh.
[01:48:34.520 --> 01:48:35.520]   You do not want to do that.
[01:48:35.520 --> 01:48:36.520]   Oh, never do that.
[01:48:36.520 --> 01:48:38.440]   Let me write that down as a show title.
[01:48:38.440 --> 01:48:39.440]   Never hug an Elmo.
[01:48:39.440 --> 01:48:41.440]   That has been as a show title.
[01:48:41.440 --> 01:48:42.440]   It has been a show title.
[01:48:42.440 --> 01:48:43.440]   It has been before.
[01:48:43.440 --> 01:48:45.440]   Never hug an Elmo has been a show title.
[01:48:45.440 --> 01:48:46.440]   We have done this pattern.
[01:48:46.440 --> 01:48:47.440]   Oh, well.
[01:48:47.440 --> 01:48:49.440]   The show is done.
[01:48:49.440 --> 01:48:51.440]   You have no memory.
[01:48:51.440 --> 01:48:52.960]   There's.
[01:48:52.960 --> 01:48:54.400]   We've all been here before.
[01:48:54.400 --> 01:48:55.400]   I blanked it out.
[01:48:55.400 --> 01:48:57.400]   There's no on the matrix.
[01:48:57.400 --> 01:48:58.400]   ARCore renamed.
[01:48:58.400 --> 01:49:01.360]   I've been on every possible Google show we could do.
[01:49:01.360 --> 01:49:02.360]   We have hit the window.
[01:49:02.360 --> 01:49:03.840]   When we get to that point.
[01:49:03.840 --> 01:49:05.840]   523 of these, that's it.
[01:49:05.840 --> 01:49:09.520]   When we get to the point where it's an infinite number of monkeys have typed out every script
[01:49:09.520 --> 01:49:11.720]   for every twig.
[01:49:11.720 --> 01:49:12.720]   We're stopping.
[01:49:12.720 --> 01:49:15.920]   ARCore renamed Google Play Services for AR.
[01:49:15.920 --> 01:49:18.080]   That just rolls off the tongue.
[01:49:18.080 --> 01:49:21.920]   Add support for note 10 and more devices.
[01:49:21.920 --> 01:49:28.920]   This is good because it's getting AR into more phones than just pixels.
[01:49:28.920 --> 01:49:34.440]   It now supports 60 frame per second rendering on devices like the Pixel 2 and the Pixel
[01:49:34.440 --> 01:49:36.040]   3 that can do.
[01:49:36.040 --> 01:49:40.040]   That'll give you a much smoother experience.
[01:49:40.040 --> 01:49:43.680]   That's an actual official change lock.
[01:49:43.680 --> 01:49:50.600]   Things that receive support for the AR service LG's G8S style 2 style of 5.
[01:49:50.600 --> 01:49:58.880]   Real me X Samsung a7 note 10 note 10 plus in the Xiaomi Mi a 3.
[01:49:58.880 --> 01:50:02.080]   Wait a second.
[01:50:02.080 --> 01:50:03.080]   What?
[01:50:03.080 --> 01:50:04.080]   Wait a second.
[01:50:04.080 --> 01:50:06.360]   Hold it good hot minute.
[01:50:06.360 --> 01:50:07.520]   Not your phone.
[01:50:07.520 --> 01:50:08.520]   What?
[01:50:08.520 --> 01:50:09.520]   Pigeon.
[01:50:09.520 --> 01:50:10.520]   Yeah?
[01:50:10.520 --> 01:50:12.320]   Only works on iPhones.
[01:50:12.320 --> 01:50:13.320]   What?
[01:50:13.320 --> 01:50:17.360]   You're a green bubble, Jeff.
[01:50:17.360 --> 01:50:19.360]   You're a green bubble.
[01:50:19.360 --> 01:50:22.680]   You're a green bubble, Jeff.
[01:50:22.680 --> 01:50:23.680]   Unpitched.
[01:50:23.680 --> 01:50:24.680]   No, God.
[01:50:24.680 --> 01:50:26.200]   A couple of bubbles on the subway.
[01:50:26.200 --> 01:50:30.440]   Is it odd that Google would have an app that doesn't work on Android?
[01:50:30.440 --> 01:50:31.440]   Yeah.
[01:50:31.440 --> 01:50:33.440]   I think they've done stuff like that before.
[01:50:33.440 --> 01:50:37.720]   I've been thinking more people likely use it.
[01:50:37.720 --> 01:50:41.120]   More people are on it.
[01:50:41.120 --> 01:50:42.120]   It's AR.
[01:50:42.120 --> 01:50:43.120]   Change lock?
[01:50:43.120 --> 01:50:44.120]   Yes.
[01:50:44.120 --> 01:50:45.120]   We're still changing.
[01:50:45.120 --> 01:50:46.120]   Oh, I was.
[01:50:46.120 --> 01:50:48.120]   Now we're done with the change.
[01:50:48.120 --> 01:50:52.120]   No, I just was curious because.
[01:50:52.120 --> 01:50:55.120]   Yes, go ahead.
[01:50:55.120 --> 01:50:57.120]   I'm sorry.
[01:50:57.120 --> 01:51:01.240]   I didn't see it on the list, but I didn't scroll all the way down and my mic is coming
[01:51:01.240 --> 01:51:02.240]   back.
[01:51:02.240 --> 01:51:03.240]   So it's not.
[01:51:03.240 --> 01:51:04.240]   Let's wrap it up.
[01:51:04.240 --> 01:51:05.240]   Let's wrap it up.
[01:51:05.240 --> 01:51:06.240]   Oh, no.
[01:51:06.240 --> 01:51:10.920]   But I thought the Justice Department talking to Google and saying, you know what?
[01:51:10.920 --> 01:51:15.520]   You cannot complete your undersea internet cable between the US and Hong Kong.
[01:51:15.520 --> 01:51:17.160]   Did you guys see that story?
[01:51:17.160 --> 01:51:18.640]   I'll go on the run down.
[01:51:18.640 --> 01:51:20.140]   That's scary.
[01:51:20.140 --> 01:51:22.920]   It's relatively new and I was I was curious.
[01:51:22.920 --> 01:51:24.280]   See, that's all part of that thing.
[01:51:24.280 --> 01:51:27.200]   You can't do business with business with China.
[01:51:27.200 --> 01:51:28.520]   Yeah.
[01:51:28.520 --> 01:51:35.120]   And well, I was curious why it was the Justice Department coming in and doing it.
[01:51:35.120 --> 01:51:36.840]   Well, I think every.
[01:51:36.840 --> 01:51:39.920]   Oh, I guess they wanted a national security review.
[01:51:39.920 --> 01:51:40.920]   Okay.
[01:51:40.920 --> 01:51:41.920]   Okay.
[01:51:41.920 --> 01:51:46.960]   So Google applied with the FCC in 2017 for this and the Justice Department and the Defense
[01:51:46.960 --> 01:51:52.160]   Department said, yo, FCC, hold off while we look at this.
[01:51:52.160 --> 01:51:53.160]   Okay.
[01:51:53.160 --> 01:51:54.160]   Oh, that sucks though.
[01:51:54.160 --> 01:51:56.160]   Yeah, no kidding.
[01:51:56.160 --> 01:51:57.160]   Yeah.
[01:51:57.160 --> 01:52:00.040]   Oh, you found the story.
[01:52:00.040 --> 01:52:01.040]   Good.
[01:52:01.040 --> 01:52:04.560]   So I thought that was worth mentioning because, you know, under having an undersea cable like
[01:52:04.560 --> 01:52:11.640]   that is really competitive and if you can't connect, if we can't connect directly to China
[01:52:11.640 --> 01:52:16.760]   or a big companies can't connect directly to China, that is breaking the internet in
[01:52:16.760 --> 01:52:19.080]   a really fundamental way.
[01:52:19.080 --> 01:52:20.560]   Yeah.
[01:52:20.560 --> 01:52:25.960]   So I just I was like, oh, well, that is that is a tough thing.
[01:52:25.960 --> 01:52:30.720]   Okay, that is all welcome to splinter nets.
[01:52:30.720 --> 01:52:36.160]   So I mean, let me let me remain smitten it.
[01:52:36.160 --> 01:52:39.800]   Schmitt schmitt schmitt internet internet.
[01:52:39.800 --> 01:52:40.800]   Internet Schmitt internet.
[01:52:40.800 --> 01:52:41.800]   Let's take a break.
[01:52:41.800 --> 01:52:43.880]   You won't Schmitt internet.
[01:52:43.880 --> 01:52:48.720]   I own Schmitt internet.com SH or a CH.
[01:52:48.720 --> 01:52:52.760]   I think I did a CH as an internet Schmitt internet Schmitt.
[01:52:52.760 --> 01:52:55.600]   The actual German central Yiddish.
[01:52:55.600 --> 01:52:56.600]   What is that?
[01:52:56.600 --> 01:52:57.600]   It sounds like Yiddish.
[01:52:57.600 --> 01:52:58.600]   Probably Yiddish.
[01:52:58.600 --> 01:52:59.600]   Schmitt on that.
[01:52:59.600 --> 01:53:00.600]   Yiddish.
[01:53:00.600 --> 01:53:01.600]   Yeah.
[01:53:01.600 --> 01:53:07.760]   Let's take a break and then your picks of the week and then Stacy can go to bed.
[01:53:07.760 --> 01:53:13.200]   Our show today brought to you by Monday, not the day, Monday.com.
[01:53:13.200 --> 01:53:19.400]   A great way to help your team manage work, meet deadlines and build a culture of transparency.
[01:53:19.400 --> 01:53:21.880]   So everybody knows what's going on at work.
[01:53:21.880 --> 01:53:23.680]   That way you can work better together.
[01:53:23.680 --> 01:53:30.680]   It's very flexible.
[01:53:30.680 --> 01:53:32.680]   It's very pretty.
[01:53:32.680 --> 01:53:33.600]   It's very easy to use, but it's a powerful tool to help you manage all your core business
[01:53:33.600 --> 01:53:37.200]   activities in one place.
[01:53:37.200 --> 01:53:43.760]   Everything from high level roadmaps, can-band style boards, specific day-to-day tasks.
[01:53:43.760 --> 01:53:47.520]   You can build a board from scratch, but they also offer a huge selection of templates.
[01:53:47.520 --> 01:53:50.960]   Take a template that sounds close and you can customize it.
[01:53:50.960 --> 01:53:52.600]   It's all completely customizable.
[01:53:52.600 --> 01:53:56.200]   You can automate workflows with reminders and notifications.
[01:53:56.200 --> 01:53:59.440]   It supports Dropbox and Google Drive, so files, no problem.
[01:53:59.440 --> 01:54:02.280]   You can upload them directly from your computer.
[01:54:02.280 --> 01:54:04.440]   Monday.com.
[01:54:04.440 --> 01:54:12.240]   It's suitable for any size team from two freelancers working across the globe or thousands of people
[01:54:12.240 --> 01:54:15.640]   in an office or any of the above.
[01:54:15.640 --> 01:54:17.880]   Teams love Monday.com.
[01:54:17.880 --> 01:54:22.920]   I think the secret to having a system that works is that its users like it.
[01:54:22.920 --> 01:54:23.920]   They want to use it.
[01:54:23.920 --> 01:54:24.920]   They live in it.
[01:54:24.920 --> 01:54:26.400]   They keep it open all the time.
[01:54:26.400 --> 01:54:30.800]   It's a whole lot better than those Excel files or whiteboards or long meetings you're
[01:54:30.800 --> 01:54:31.800]   doing right now.
[01:54:31.800 --> 01:54:33.960]   No meetings, please.
[01:54:33.960 --> 01:54:38.040]   Monday.com keeps you on track creating accountability by assigning owners.
[01:54:38.040 --> 01:54:40.160]   So you know who's doing what?
[01:54:40.160 --> 01:54:43.680]   You'll never miss a deadline with a My Week feature, which is a personal assistant for
[01:54:43.680 --> 01:54:47.840]   you and your team that helps you check what's coming up and make sure it all goes.
[01:54:47.840 --> 01:54:48.840]   It gets done.
[01:54:48.840 --> 01:54:54.280]   Stay in control anywhere you go with a mobile app as well on the Monday.com mobile app.
[01:54:54.280 --> 01:54:59.160]   So on your desktop, on your phone, on your tablet too, it's Monday.com.
[01:54:59.160 --> 01:55:02.520]   Yes, it works great on a Chromebook.
[01:55:02.520 --> 01:55:03.520]   Monday.com.
[01:55:03.520 --> 01:55:05.120]   I really like it.
[01:55:05.120 --> 01:55:08.280]   It's just friendly as heck and yet powerful too.
[01:55:08.280 --> 01:55:09.840]   It's a perfect combination.
[01:55:09.840 --> 01:55:11.440]   And you don't have to take my word for it.
[01:55:11.440 --> 01:55:17.960]   You've got a two week trial, fruit trial waiting for you at Monday.com/twig-monday.com/twigs.
[01:55:17.960 --> 01:55:22.920]   Dacey, I'll let you go early if you give me your pick or your thing of the week.
[01:55:22.920 --> 01:55:25.920]   Okay, so my thing this week is a drink recipe.
[01:55:25.920 --> 01:55:30.720]   I figure like once every three times a year I can give you a drink recipe.
[01:55:30.720 --> 01:55:38.800]   I, because I miss Texas so much, I've been playing around with Mexican martini recipes.
[01:55:38.800 --> 01:55:39.800]   Oh, yeah.
[01:55:39.800 --> 01:55:43.040]   I assume y'all know what a Mexican martini is.
[01:55:43.040 --> 01:55:44.880]   Nope, nope, nope.
[01:55:44.880 --> 01:55:45.880]   Really?
[01:55:45.880 --> 01:55:46.880]   Okay.
[01:55:46.880 --> 01:55:47.880]   Oh.
[01:55:47.880 --> 01:55:48.880]   Somebody does.
[01:55:48.880 --> 01:55:50.320]   I know I was excited.
[01:55:50.320 --> 01:55:55.560]   Jeff, if you like a margarita, a Mexican martini is like an oversized margarita served
[01:55:55.560 --> 01:55:57.200]   in a martini shaker.
[01:55:57.200 --> 01:55:59.280]   Only it's a little different.
[01:55:59.280 --> 01:56:00.280]   And where are you wearing?
[01:56:00.280 --> 01:56:01.760]   Does it have a rim of salt?
[01:56:01.760 --> 01:56:02.920]   It does have a rim of salt.
[01:56:02.920 --> 01:56:03.920]   It has a...
[01:56:03.920 --> 01:56:05.480]   It has a ghost peppers in it.
[01:56:05.480 --> 01:56:07.000]   So it does not have ghost peppers.
[01:56:07.000 --> 01:56:10.520]   Although if you want to take some habanero bitters and just stick that on top.
[01:56:10.520 --> 01:56:11.520]   Oh, baby.
[01:56:11.520 --> 01:56:14.440]   So there are two recipes on the internet.
[01:56:14.440 --> 01:56:18.160]   Actually there are a couple more, but the only two that even come close are Texas Monthly
[01:56:18.160 --> 01:56:22.600]   did one in 2013 and the New York Times did one in 2011.
[01:56:22.600 --> 01:56:25.480]   Because I am a service journalist, I took both.
[01:56:25.480 --> 01:56:27.400]   You tried both of them.
[01:56:27.400 --> 01:56:32.200]   And I'm going to tell you the New York Times 2011 version is actually closer to the taste
[01:56:32.200 --> 01:56:34.960]   of the Mexican martini I know and love.
[01:56:34.960 --> 01:56:35.960]   Which I am shocked.
[01:56:35.960 --> 01:56:37.960]   These are people who put peas in guacamole.
[01:56:37.960 --> 01:56:42.760]   That is not a section 230 reporting.
[01:56:42.760 --> 01:56:43.760]   Yes.
[01:56:43.760 --> 01:56:44.760]   Exactly.
[01:56:44.760 --> 01:56:47.280]   And I figured Texas Monthly, they would have the best one.
[01:56:47.280 --> 01:56:48.280]   Oh, come on.
[01:56:48.280 --> 01:56:51.760]   There are other recipes on the internet that include Sprite.
[01:56:51.760 --> 01:56:52.760]   Do not.
[01:56:52.760 --> 01:56:53.760]   Do not.
[01:56:53.760 --> 01:56:54.760]   Do not.
[01:56:54.760 --> 01:56:55.760]   Do not.
[01:56:55.760 --> 01:56:56.760]   Just know.
[01:56:56.760 --> 01:57:05.480]   But should you feel like elevating your martini, this also makes it a lot.
[01:57:05.480 --> 01:57:06.760]   Elevate your margarita.
[01:57:06.760 --> 01:57:10.920]   You serve it in a martini glass with your martini shaker on the side with the little olives
[01:57:10.920 --> 01:57:13.640]   and a touch of brine to your margarita.
[01:57:13.640 --> 01:57:17.440]   Try those jalapeno stuffed olives for extra kick.
[01:57:17.440 --> 01:57:18.440]   Yes.
[01:57:18.440 --> 01:57:24.920]   So this is, Jim, while you're there, where did you say you were?
[01:57:24.920 --> 01:57:25.920]   Oh, AT&T.
[01:57:25.920 --> 01:57:29.640]   The best place to go where New York closest to you.
[01:57:29.640 --> 01:57:30.640]   You've got two options.
[01:57:30.640 --> 01:57:32.320]   Trudy's is the place where it originated.
[01:57:32.320 --> 01:57:34.320]   No, Cedar Door is where it originated.
[01:57:34.320 --> 01:57:36.160]   And Trudy's is where I used to go.
[01:57:36.160 --> 01:57:37.960]   They also have a good queso.
[01:57:37.960 --> 01:57:40.120]   Cedar Door, I don't know about their queso.
[01:57:40.120 --> 01:57:42.680]   But there's a Trudy's on 29th and Guad.
[01:57:42.680 --> 01:57:46.360]   And then there's a Cedar Door down by the convention center that's actually a legit
[01:57:46.360 --> 01:57:47.360]   place.
[01:57:47.360 --> 01:57:50.880]   A little bit of heaven is a Mexican martini and a nice big bowl of queso.
[01:57:50.880 --> 01:57:51.880]   Queso.
[01:57:51.880 --> 01:57:53.640]   Go eat it for me, Jeff.
[01:57:53.640 --> 01:57:55.880]   I'll wait, but you're hard.
[01:57:55.880 --> 01:57:56.880]   You miss it, don't you?
[01:57:56.880 --> 01:57:57.880]   You miss it.
[01:57:57.880 --> 01:57:58.880]   You really miss it?
[01:57:58.880 --> 01:57:59.880]   Oh.
[01:57:59.880 --> 01:58:01.880]   I miss the food.
[01:58:01.880 --> 01:58:02.880]   Yeah.
[01:58:02.880 --> 01:58:05.520]   But you have constant drizzle.
[01:58:05.520 --> 01:58:07.360]   So that's all I'm going to do.
[01:58:07.360 --> 01:58:08.360]   It's beautiful.
[01:58:08.360 --> 01:58:11.160]   And for the first time in my life, I've been able to grow tomatoes.
[01:58:11.160 --> 01:58:12.160]   So I'm very excited.
[01:58:12.160 --> 01:58:13.160]   There you go.
[01:58:13.160 --> 01:58:14.160]   There you go.
[01:58:14.160 --> 01:58:15.160]   But there are trade-offs.
[01:58:15.160 --> 01:58:17.440]   Give us a number.
[01:58:17.440 --> 01:58:19.440]   So I'm kind of cheating.
[01:58:19.440 --> 01:58:22.080]   Two buildings for two huge buildings for Google.
[01:58:22.080 --> 01:58:29.560]   When I was down last driving by the construction at Google, I'm fascinated by the new construction
[01:58:29.560 --> 01:58:30.560]   that they have.
[01:58:30.560 --> 01:58:31.560]   It's just amazing.
[01:58:31.560 --> 01:58:32.560]   There are pictures up online.
[01:58:32.560 --> 01:58:38.640]   This doesn't work for our audio fans so much, but there are pictures at the link of the
[01:58:38.640 --> 01:58:42.200]   amazing roof is done.
[01:58:42.200 --> 01:58:44.040]   It's a garden roof, yes?
[01:58:44.040 --> 01:58:46.040]   A garden roof?
[01:58:46.040 --> 01:58:47.040]   What does that mean?
[01:58:47.040 --> 01:58:48.040]   Oh, it's not a garden roof.
[01:58:48.040 --> 01:58:49.040]   It's a tent roof.
[01:58:49.040 --> 01:58:55.600]   It's a huge tent over many buildings that we built underneath it.
[01:58:55.600 --> 01:58:56.600]   And it's quite amazing.
[01:58:56.600 --> 01:58:57.600]   You see it.
[01:58:57.600 --> 01:58:59.520]   It's very impressive on the ground.
[01:58:59.520 --> 01:59:03.840]   The weird thing with the picture is it looks like it's dirty already, but I don't know.
[01:59:03.840 --> 01:59:06.120]   Yeah, it does, doesn't it?
[01:59:06.120 --> 01:59:07.120]   Maybe they'll clean it up later.
[01:59:07.120 --> 01:59:08.120]   Don't face that.
[01:59:08.120 --> 01:59:10.080]   I don't like this.
[01:59:10.080 --> 01:59:12.680]   You could see there's already a potential problem.
[01:59:12.680 --> 01:59:14.880]   It looks rusty.
[01:59:14.880 --> 01:59:23.400]   And meanwhile, Google now has major plans for San Jose with, I think it was 5,000 jobs
[01:59:23.400 --> 01:59:28.360]   and 25,000 homes and 6 and a half million square feet of offices.
[01:59:28.360 --> 01:59:29.360]   Wow.
[01:59:29.360 --> 01:59:33.880]   You know, San Jose is a very strange city.
[01:59:33.880 --> 01:59:36.160]   It feels like it was built, but then deserted.
[01:59:36.160 --> 01:59:37.160]   Yes, it was.
[01:59:37.160 --> 01:59:38.160]   What?
[01:59:38.160 --> 01:59:39.160]   They were, it was.
[01:59:39.160 --> 01:59:40.160]   For the way to discredit.
[01:59:40.160 --> 01:59:44.280]   When I, when I lived there, when I lived in San Francisco, nobody ever went south.
[01:59:44.280 --> 01:59:45.280]   Right.
[01:59:45.280 --> 01:59:46.280]   North, you never went south.
[01:59:46.280 --> 01:59:48.760]   The peninsula was, you never caught dead there.
[01:59:48.760 --> 01:59:50.520]   It was just, it was just boring suburbs.
[01:59:50.520 --> 01:59:55.320]   And then San Jose was the nearest thing to a city that people abandoned.
[01:59:55.320 --> 01:59:56.320]   Right.
[01:59:56.320 --> 01:59:57.320]   And yeah, it was, it was gone.
[01:59:57.320 --> 01:59:58.320]   Gone.
[01:59:58.320 --> 01:59:59.320]   Nothing.
[01:59:59.320 --> 02:00:01.560]   And now it's a nice, decent place, but you're right.
[02:00:01.560 --> 02:00:03.920]   It's as if it's, it was freeze dried.
[02:00:03.920 --> 02:00:04.920]   Yeah.
[02:00:04.920 --> 02:00:05.920]   And there's now been thawed.
[02:00:05.920 --> 02:00:06.920]   Yeah.
[02:00:06.920 --> 02:00:10.600]   I, I worked in radio in San Jose for years before coming to San Francisco.
[02:00:10.600 --> 02:00:11.600]   Really?
[02:00:11.600 --> 02:00:12.600]   Yeah.
[02:00:12.600 --> 02:00:13.600]   Cool.
[02:00:13.600 --> 02:00:16.920]   And that's kind of where I first got into technology because we were in Silicon Valley.
[02:00:16.920 --> 02:00:21.720]   It was the late 70s and it was a very exciting time.
[02:00:21.720 --> 02:00:24.800]   But it always felt like, where are all the people?
[02:00:24.800 --> 02:00:26.840]   It's like a, yeah.
[02:00:26.840 --> 02:00:27.840]   It's like a movie.
[02:00:27.840 --> 02:00:31.280]   It still does to a step.
[02:00:31.280 --> 02:00:32.280]   Yeah.
[02:00:32.280 --> 02:00:35.880]   Matthew, anything you'd like to pick or plug?
[02:00:35.880 --> 02:00:37.280]   I do have something that's weird.
[02:00:37.280 --> 02:00:38.560]   We should call this bigger plug.
[02:00:38.560 --> 02:00:39.560]   Yeah.
[02:00:39.560 --> 02:00:47.400]   It's a little strange because I like the odd and this one fits with something I've been
[02:00:47.400 --> 02:00:54.720]   thinking about, which is how to sort of randomize your life, how to break out of ruts or whatever.
[02:00:54.720 --> 02:01:01.000]   So I came across this article about a group on Reddit, of course.
[02:01:01.000 --> 02:01:03.280]   They call themselves random knots.
[02:01:03.280 --> 02:01:09.760]   And so without going into too much detail there, they believe that, or they're trying
[02:01:09.760 --> 02:01:14.000]   to challenge the idea that we live in a simulation.
[02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:17.680]   So they're trying to get out of the loop as it were.
[02:01:17.680 --> 02:01:23.160]   And part of what they do is they randomly generate places to go to.
[02:01:23.160 --> 02:01:31.680]   And so there's a fairly complicated process where you log into a telegram app and you
[02:01:31.680 --> 02:01:36.040]   type a command, get a tractor or get void.
[02:01:36.040 --> 02:01:43.080]   And then their software uses a quantum random number generator and spits out a place for
[02:01:43.080 --> 02:01:44.880]   you to go to.
[02:01:44.880 --> 02:01:51.680]   And the idea is you're supposed to catch the simulation glitching by fooling it and doing
[02:01:51.680 --> 02:01:52.680]   something random.
[02:01:52.680 --> 02:01:54.160]   Anyway, all of that.
[02:01:54.160 --> 02:01:58.800]   Here's the diagram if you want to try to figure it out.
[02:01:58.800 --> 02:02:00.760]   Escape determinism.
[02:02:00.760 --> 02:02:01.760]   Yeah.
[02:02:01.760 --> 02:02:02.760]   Yeah.
[02:02:02.760 --> 02:02:07.160]   It's sort of half a joke and half, I think, a real thing.
[02:02:07.160 --> 02:02:13.000]   But if you avoid all the kind of simulation part, what it is is just a way to get you
[02:02:13.000 --> 02:02:16.200]   to randomly go to different places because it's interesting.
[02:02:16.200 --> 02:02:17.200]   It's free.
[02:02:17.200 --> 02:02:19.280]   I'd end up in San Jose.
[02:02:19.280 --> 02:02:21.640]   You might.
[02:02:21.640 --> 02:02:27.960]   And so they log things that they find that they think are evidence of either the simulation
[02:02:27.960 --> 02:02:34.640]   glitching or, so for example, three identical black cats, an upside down airplane.
[02:02:34.640 --> 02:02:40.240]   Wouldn't the glitch prove that you're in the matrix, not that it's not a simulation?
[02:02:40.240 --> 02:02:41.800]   It proves it is a simulation.
[02:02:41.800 --> 02:02:46.240]   So part of them are trying to prove it is and part of them and some of them are trying
[02:02:46.240 --> 02:02:47.680]   to get out of it.
[02:02:47.680 --> 02:02:48.680]   Anyway.
[02:02:48.680 --> 02:02:50.680]   It's not important that you believe about it.
[02:02:50.680 --> 02:02:51.680]   It's not the right deal.
[02:02:51.680 --> 02:02:52.680]   Now I have a headache too.
[02:02:52.680 --> 02:02:58.080]   I thought it was interesting that some of the stuff there, so they describe just randomly
[02:02:58.080 --> 02:03:03.200]   going to different places, which is something I've actually started doing.
[02:03:03.200 --> 02:03:07.840]   Not in any organized way, obviously, but it reminded me of this guy that I came across
[02:03:07.840 --> 02:03:11.000]   and now I'm going to forget his name, but he was trying to do the same thing.
[02:03:11.000 --> 02:03:14.000]   So he wrote his own apps.
[02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:20.080]   And one was a kind of, I think it was an add on to Uber or it was like an Uber, but you
[02:03:20.080 --> 02:03:22.000]   couldn't put in a destination.
[02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:24.520]   It would randomly generate a destination.
[02:03:24.520 --> 02:03:27.200]   And then you would just go there and see what happened.
[02:03:27.200 --> 02:03:33.440]   He started randomly showing up at people's events, so he would pick a random event and
[02:03:33.440 --> 02:03:37.280]   just show up at it, like someone's birthday party or an anniversary.
[02:03:37.280 --> 02:03:42.840]   I just think, I thought it was hilarious that he, at one point he actually got a random tattoo,
[02:03:42.840 --> 02:03:47.080]   which he thought could have gone bad in the past.
[02:03:47.080 --> 02:03:50.800]   Randomly, you just walked in and said, "Tattoo me?"
[02:03:50.800 --> 02:03:55.320]   I think he actually wrote a script that then just pulled in a bunch of tattoos and picked
[02:03:55.320 --> 02:03:58.280]   one at random.
[02:03:58.280 --> 02:04:04.200]   And he's actually designing apps that he wants to provide so other people can randomize things
[02:04:04.200 --> 02:04:05.200]   in their life.
[02:04:05.200 --> 02:04:08.320]   Anyway, he just wound up with, I think, some Celtic thing or whatever.
[02:04:08.320 --> 02:04:09.800]   So it wasn't actually that bad.
[02:04:09.800 --> 02:04:15.600]   Fortunately, the total set of tattoos is not exactly random.
[02:04:15.600 --> 02:04:21.160]   There's a certain tendency toward Celtic that probably saved him in that case.
[02:04:21.160 --> 02:04:24.680]   I just thought this random not thing was hilarious.
[02:04:24.680 --> 02:04:26.120]   And anyway, it's a lot of fun.
[02:04:26.120 --> 02:04:27.120]   It's very Reddit.
[02:04:27.120 --> 02:04:32.760]   Reddit reminds me of the sense of humor of Reddit reminds me of a smart high schooler.
[02:04:32.760 --> 02:04:36.520]   Yeah, that's kind of a lot of irony.
[02:04:36.520 --> 02:04:43.920]   And all right, well, since we're in the Reddit vein, let me share a Reddit subreddit that
[02:04:43.920 --> 02:04:45.440]   Karsten shared with me.
[02:04:45.440 --> 02:04:50.080]   For a long time, I was a fan of the subreddit, "Yes, yes, yes," where you watch a video where
[02:04:50.080 --> 02:04:53.960]   somebody tries something daring and unusual and makes it.
[02:04:53.960 --> 02:04:55.320]   But you kind of, it's a feta complete.
[02:04:55.320 --> 02:04:56.320]   You know they're going to make it.
[02:04:56.320 --> 02:05:00.360]   Then I started watching, "No, no, no," where somebody tries something and it turns out
[02:05:00.360 --> 02:05:02.720]   to be really stupid.
[02:05:02.720 --> 02:05:05.960]   But Karsten said, "No, no, no, you shouldn't follow, no, no, no."
[02:05:05.960 --> 02:05:10.560]   Or, "Yes, yes, yes, yes, you should follow, maybe, maybe, maybe."
[02:05:10.560 --> 02:05:15.760]   These are videos from, "Yes, yes, yes," and "No, no, no," but they don't telegraph
[02:05:15.760 --> 02:05:16.760]   the results.
[02:05:16.760 --> 02:05:18.000]   So you don't know if it's going to go well.
[02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:21.600]   For instance, here's a woman attempting to cross an icy street.
[02:05:21.600 --> 02:05:22.960]   Will it go well or poorly?
[02:05:22.960 --> 02:05:23.960]   We don't know.
[02:05:23.960 --> 02:05:24.960]   Maybe?
[02:05:24.960 --> 02:05:25.960]   Maybe?
[02:05:25.960 --> 02:05:26.960]   No, she's slipping.
[02:05:26.960 --> 02:05:29.960]   But wait, but wait, there's more.
[02:05:29.960 --> 02:05:35.800]   Two more people walking for all.
[02:05:35.800 --> 02:05:39.040]   Exactly the same way in place.
[02:05:39.040 --> 02:05:40.840]   I could watch these all day.
[02:05:40.840 --> 02:05:44.120]   Then there's one more thing I would, so that's maybe, maybe, maybe on Reddit.
[02:05:44.120 --> 02:05:48.520]   I sprinkle that into my Reddit feed so that I have fun stuff in between all the Trump
[02:05:48.520 --> 02:05:49.520]   posts.
[02:05:49.520 --> 02:05:53.000]   Then I have to say, the world is going to hell in a hand basket.
[02:05:53.000 --> 02:05:58.280]   One of the great rock and roll stations in the Bay Area, you probably know it yourself,
[02:05:58.280 --> 02:06:05.000]   Jeff Jarvis, K-Fog is going down their owners.
[02:06:05.000 --> 02:06:11.120]   The number, I think the number two radio company in America, Cumulus, are going to flip it
[02:06:11.120 --> 02:06:15.520]   from its rock and roll routes to a simulcast of an existing station that I used to work
[02:06:15.520 --> 02:06:17.280]   on for years, K&BR.
[02:06:17.280 --> 02:06:18.760]   It'll be all sports.
[02:06:18.760 --> 02:06:27.280]   Cumulus said, "K&BR, FM will give sports fans another place to tune into K&BR."
[02:06:27.280 --> 02:06:30.440]   What an addition to the market.
[02:06:30.440 --> 02:06:34.800]   I am actually on another Cumulus station in the Bay Area, so I should be very nice about
[02:06:34.800 --> 02:06:36.800]   all of this, but it is a great station.
[02:06:36.800 --> 02:06:39.240]   The business is very challenged.
[02:06:39.240 --> 02:06:41.440]   It's all old mass media.
[02:06:41.440 --> 02:06:43.240]   It's very challenging.
[02:06:43.240 --> 02:06:45.280]   It's not a good business.
[02:06:45.280 --> 02:06:48.440]   Frankly, that's why podcasting is on a tear.
[02:06:48.440 --> 02:06:51.240]   It's all in it.
[02:06:51.240 --> 02:06:55.280]   Ladies and gentlemen, we come to the end of this show.
[02:06:55.280 --> 02:06:56.360]   Thank you so much for joining us.
[02:06:56.360 --> 02:06:59.280]   I always love doing this because I love these guys.
[02:06:59.280 --> 02:07:00.880]   It's a great panel.
[02:07:00.880 --> 02:07:03.440]   Matthew Ingram, always a welcome addition to the panel.
[02:07:03.440 --> 02:07:04.440]   He's a chief digital writer.
[02:07:04.440 --> 02:07:05.440]   Yay!
[02:07:05.440 --> 02:07:12.080]   At the Columbia Journalist's Review, cjr.org at Matthewye on the Twitter spelled correctly
[02:07:12.080 --> 02:07:15.520]   with a mere single T.
[02:07:15.520 --> 02:07:18.880]   Don't be confused by the other Matthew.
[02:07:18.880 --> 02:07:19.880]   Thank you, Matthew.
[02:07:19.880 --> 02:07:20.880]   I appreciate it.
[02:07:20.880 --> 02:07:22.040]   Are you back from the cottage?
[02:07:22.040 --> 02:07:23.400]   No, you're still in the cottage.
[02:07:23.400 --> 02:07:24.920]   Oh, I am still at the cottage.
[02:07:24.920 --> 02:07:28.960]   Yeah, you'll notice I don't have the book with the small picture.
[02:07:28.960 --> 02:07:30.600]   The Nazi book has been moved.
[02:07:30.600 --> 02:07:31.600]   Thank you.
[02:07:31.600 --> 02:07:33.240]   You know, I thought about that.
[02:07:33.240 --> 02:07:37.720]   When you first came on and I thought, "How sad that is," the Matthew before he did the
[02:07:37.720 --> 02:07:40.600]   show had to say, "Oh, now I've got to move that book again."
[02:07:40.600 --> 02:07:41.600]   No, I didn't.
[02:07:41.600 --> 02:07:43.640]   I tilted the camera a different way.
[02:07:43.640 --> 02:07:44.640]   Oh, okay.
[02:07:44.640 --> 02:07:45.640]   It's still there.
[02:07:45.640 --> 02:07:46.640]   Okay.
[02:07:46.640 --> 02:07:47.640]   Your head's blocking it.
[02:07:47.640 --> 02:07:48.640]   Thanks also to Steve.
[02:07:48.640 --> 02:07:51.040]   To be fair, we should explain that it is not a Nazi book.
[02:07:51.040 --> 02:07:52.040]   No, no, no, no.
[02:07:52.040 --> 02:07:53.040]   No, no, no.
[02:07:53.040 --> 02:07:54.040]   The rise of the story.
[02:07:54.040 --> 02:07:55.040]   Was it the rise of the story?
[02:07:55.040 --> 02:07:56.040]   Was it the rise of the story?
[02:07:56.040 --> 02:07:57.040]   Was it the rise of the story?
[02:07:57.040 --> 02:07:58.040]   Was it the rise of the story?
[02:07:58.040 --> 02:07:59.040]   Was it the rise of the story?
[02:07:59.040 --> 02:08:00.040]   Was it the rise of the story?
[02:08:00.040 --> 02:08:01.040]   Yeah.
[02:08:01.040 --> 02:08:02.040]   That's correct.
[02:08:02.040 --> 02:08:03.040]   It's so timely.
[02:08:03.040 --> 02:08:09.240]   It's maybe a little too timely, a little too close to home.
[02:08:09.240 --> 02:08:10.240]   Thank you, Matthew.
[02:08:10.240 --> 02:08:11.240]   Always a pleasure.
[02:08:11.240 --> 02:08:12.240]   Stacey, always great.
[02:08:12.240 --> 02:08:13.240]   Enjoy.
[02:08:13.240 --> 02:08:18.840]   Make sure Jeff enjoys a Texas martini and a bowl of queso in your honor.
[02:08:18.840 --> 02:08:21.440]   Mexican martini.
[02:08:21.440 --> 02:08:24.520]   Which is really a Texan martini, but we won't go on.
[02:08:24.520 --> 02:08:25.840]   We stole it from Mexico.
[02:08:25.840 --> 02:08:28.040]   Oh, like Texas itself.
[02:08:28.040 --> 02:08:30.040]   So it's perfect, sir.
[02:08:30.040 --> 02:08:34.760]   Stacey Higginbotham is at staceyoniot.com at gigastacey on the Twitter.
[02:08:34.760 --> 02:08:38.840]   Don't forget our fabulous podcast with Kevin Tofill, the IoT podcast.
[02:08:38.840 --> 02:08:40.560]   We're going to know all about IoT.
[02:08:40.560 --> 02:08:42.440]   Thanks, Stacey.
[02:08:42.440 --> 02:08:44.240]   And Jeff Jarvis, he is in Austin.
[02:08:44.240 --> 02:08:45.160]   I hope you're going to have a good time.
[02:08:45.160 --> 02:08:46.960]   What are you there for?
[02:08:46.960 --> 02:08:49.280]   I'm worried about trust and journalism.
[02:08:49.280 --> 02:08:52.760]   I love it that you have a Longhorn bowl in a photo behind you.
[02:08:52.760 --> 02:08:53.920]   I know it's behind you.
[02:08:53.920 --> 02:08:54.920]   Yeah.
[02:08:54.920 --> 02:08:55.920]   The one.
[02:08:55.920 --> 02:08:56.920]   That's awesome.
[02:08:56.920 --> 02:08:59.320]   I'm at the hotel run by UT Austin.
[02:08:59.320 --> 02:09:00.320]   Oh, perfect.
[02:09:00.320 --> 02:09:02.360]   Hook him horns.
[02:09:02.360 --> 02:09:07.200]   And Carson really wanted me to have queso at the ready on the show so I could rub it in
[02:09:07.200 --> 02:09:09.320]   if there was no queso.
[02:09:09.320 --> 02:09:12.800]   I do not want to see you rub in queso, but if you wanted to eat it, I'd be okay with
[02:09:12.800 --> 02:09:13.800]   that.
[02:09:13.800 --> 02:09:14.800]   That's the only thing I can do with it.
[02:09:14.800 --> 02:09:15.800]   I'm Kio.
[02:09:15.800 --> 02:09:16.800]   Don't rub in the queso.
[02:09:16.800 --> 02:09:17.800]   I could rub it on my body though.
[02:09:17.800 --> 02:09:18.800]   That might be fun.
[02:09:18.800 --> 02:09:21.280]   We do this weekend.

[02:10:11.680 --> 02:10:12.680]   episode.
