[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   It's time for Twig this week in Google. Jeff Jarvis is here. Kevin Marks is here.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   We've got a lot to talk about. Of course, we'll mention the story out of Irving, Texas, about Ahmed and his time bomb clock.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   But there's also great news from Google. Some acquisitions, some hires, and the return of Google Glass.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   Maybe it's all coming up next on Twig.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   Netcast you love. From people you trust.

[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   The show where we talk about the Google verse, the Twitter verse, the Facebook verse.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   And there's a lot of verse going on.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   Right now we also do a lot of media coverage because of this guy right here.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   One of the world's most renowned, most prestigious media pundits.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   - Professional prestigious as I can. - You don't look prestigious.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   You look crazy.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Jeff Jarvis is a professor of journalism at the City University of New York, the author of what would Google do?
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   Public parts, Gutenberg, the geek, geek sparing gifts and blogs@buzzmachine.com.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   Hello, Mr. J.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   Good to be back on the show. How was New York for you?
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   I love New York.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   I mean, I don't know how anybody has a car in New York.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   No.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   It takes even with Uber taxis, it takes forever to get anywhere.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   We ended up on the Steak-Sup ways.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   We did. We ended up on the subway because it's the only way to get around town.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   It's the best way. It's a 600-mile miracle.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   It is, really.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   Yeah, it's phenomenal.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   It is. I had to persuade Lisa to go on the subway.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   No, no, no. It's the only way to go.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Yeah, but once we did, she said, "Why haven't we been taking these all the time?"
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   It's like, "Well, the frustration of sitting in traffic is just awful."
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   No, I never drive into the city. I drive to the river.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   Yeah. I think the train underneath.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   Also here, Kevin Marks.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   Hi, there, gentlemen.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   From Kevin Marks.com. I could give you an equally long list of credits, probably even longer.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   No problem.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   But one of the early creators of the concept of podcasting, he was working at Apple,
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   BBC for it before that. He's worked also at Google, British Telecom.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   Now, he's sitting in the rain in his garden. It's not raining over there.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   It's not raining yet. It's raining here, so beware.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   And that good news.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   Hey, very good.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   What happened, brother? So I should be all right.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   No, it'll be fine. And if you have to move, we can accommodate.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   Do you have a dog?
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   I have dogs.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Does your dog bite?
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   Stop on dog.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   I want to get you out of here in time for the Republican debate on CNN.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   So that means we got about 80 minutes.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   I think that should be enough.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   I want to start with... We had a great conversation with Jenny Chardin on triangulation on Monday.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   Love her. Love Jenny.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   She's so great.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   Posted this morning on Boing Boing,
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   Arab-looking man of Syrian descent found in garage building what looks like a bomb.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   Of course, Steve Jobs' biological parents were Syrian.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   Or his dad anyway.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   And there he is building what looks like a bomb.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   I saw it in movies.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   I am so glad. This is one place where social media has such a great job to do.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   Of course, Anil Dash taking the lead on this.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   He's really taking the lead on Ahmed, and it's great.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   You've seen Obama's tweet, yes?
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   No, the president got involved. Good, what did he say?
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   Is it the "POTUS" account?
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   Yeah, and he tweeted, "It looks like a cool clock and invited it into the White House."
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   Oh, oh, I'm going to cry.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   Cool clock, Ahmed.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   Is that the greatest one?
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   Want to bring it to the White House?
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   We should inspire more kids like you to like science.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   Isn't that the best?
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   On the rundown, I put in Ahmed's Twitter account.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   Oh, good. Let me go there too.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   Near the bottom of other.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   Okay.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   Oh, you have a cool word?
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   Yeah.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   So here's a 14-year-old kid, freshman in high school, brand new school.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   He's kind of a maker. He's kind of a geek.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   He wanted to impress a little bit.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   So he, in 20 minutes, because he has a lot of stuff in his bedroom.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   A lot of electronic stuff, because he's a maker.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   He built a clock.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   He thought, "I'll bring a digital clock into school.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   I'll bring a book to impress kids."
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   Irving, Texas, science teacher sees it and says,
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   "You know, I'd put that away. Do not show that to anybody else."
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   Ahmed doesn't listen.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   He shows it to another teacher who immediately calls the principal.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   The principal calls the police.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   He's carted off in handcuffs, taken to do a juvenile detention center.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   The police officer said it looked like a bomb.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   Actually, he said it looked like a movie bomb.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   [laughter]
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   And he was before he was put in a cell, fortunately, this poor 14-year-old,
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   who just wanted to, by the way, wearing a NASA T-shirt with handcuffs on him
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   in the picture that made it to the Dallas newspapers.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   He just wanted to show he was a geek with some cred.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   Instead, he's three-day suspension.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   He could conceivably be prosecuted, although I did not listen to the press conference
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   Did the police department back down?
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   I didn't either. I don't know what's even a bit.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   Well, it's beyond stupid.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   It's racist. It's racist. It's horrific.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   Islamophobia meets technopanic.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   Yes.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   And I wouldn't have led with it except I just loved that picture that Jenny posted
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   of a Syrian nerd in his garage.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   I also just love.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   But the fact that now this is the coolest kid in America.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   Yeah, you know what? It actually was all worthwhile.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   I can't imagine how scared he was when the police came and put him in handcuffs
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   because even though he told everybody in the school, it's at the clock.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   It's a digital clock. They said, "Oh, it's a bomb."
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   The police described it as a hoax bomb, even though he's suspicious in nature.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   It's a clock.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   The thing is, you know, it's a kind of clock they put on bombs in movies
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   for a plot point. You wouldn't actually put anything like that on a bomb.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   You've got a bomb that's going to blow up at a certain time.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   You don't put a bright light on it. There's counting down.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   That's just a clock device.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   Well, it's exactly Bruchnaya's movie plot threat nonsense,
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   "Bisonified."
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   Well, it also, to me, underscores how ignorant most Americans are
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   about how electronics works. They've seen digital clocks.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   They just never bothered to look inside to see exactly the same kinds of components.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   Right.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   By the way, if it's a bomb, then where are the explosive elements of this?
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   It's a circuit board. It's a minor detail.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   This will break your heart. The second tweet in this, which obviously I think
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   I think Neil helped do,
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   Ahmed says, "Thank you for your support.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   I really didn't think people would care about a Muslim boy."
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   Oh, I'm going to try.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   Doesn't that just break your heart?
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   It breaks my heart.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   And it breaks my view of this country right now.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   And I know people, your viewers get mad when I get to be political,
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   but F-ed, I don't care.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   This is exactly why Donald Trump is a demagogue and an evil.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   We're trying to bring this, this hating of the others up.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   And this is the result.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   You know, other...
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   It's serving Texas. The mayor of Irving is famous for being an Islamophistic.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   For being an Islamophobe.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   Look at all the great pictures in solidarity with Ahmed.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   I think so. This is where social media is just fan-tastic.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   This is all from his Twitter feed, which means he's seen every one of these.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   Grant A. Mahara, who is a wonderful fellow we know,
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   makes stuff for the Mythbusters.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   Absolutely tragic when I was his age.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   I took everything apart too and tried to make things.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   This is not what America needs.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   American needs people who make things, not terror and fear,
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   of a homemade clock and ignorance.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   I wonder if the Donald will mention this on the debate tonight.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   Well, I would have more of the journalists will.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   Hillary Clinton tweeted, "Assumptions and fear don't keep us safe.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   They hold us back. Ahmed stayed curious and keep building."
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   I'm glad to see this is a response and a support.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   He tweets about to meet attorney.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   I imagine there'll be a bit of a lawsuit in that.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   Which is a shame because really that's not the solution.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   The solution is this, which is so amazing.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   No, but there needs to be consequences for bigotry.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   Because what if this kid, you know,
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   what if it hadn't come out on social media,
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   what if there hadn't been an anneal,
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   and this kid just ends up being miserable for years,
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   hence forward.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   Well, there are lots of kids probably in that position right now.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   Exactly.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   Exactly.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   For some slight that's not as so
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   colossally, theatrically stupid as this Texan moment.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   It looked like a movie bomb.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   Jesus.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   I saw some reference in the news that he was not going to be charged.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   No charges are being filed.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   Yes, he does.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   Well, yeah.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   What would you charge him with?
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   A movie bomb?
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   There is no explosives.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   It's a circuit board and a clock.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   You charge him with scare and stupid people.
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   Oh, you scared.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   You know, if that becomes a crime, we're in deep trouble.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   Amen.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   So you also have a question with that,
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   his parents present so that there are just awful.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   There is going to be a significant lawsuit.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   People should lose jobs at least.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   People should lose jobs over this.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   Whoever arrested the principal of the school should be out of his or her job.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   The teacher reported it.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   I would push for a 10 year fight on that.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   The police, who did this?
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   The mayor?
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.400]   They should be hounded out of their jobs because who wants such idiots in charge of such important
[00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:45.000]   things as education and safety in this town?
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   It's not a bomb.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   It's a clock.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   All right.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   I just, I had to bring that up because I'm glad you did for crying out loud.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   Google is, I hope I'm not stealing your number.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   I have a number if you don't.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   No, no, no, I've got numbers.
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   So, so I did put this in the numbers, but I found it so fast.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   And I saw that Jason put it up on the end.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   I raised it for mine because it's appropriate number.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   Two billion lines of code run Google.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   Wow.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   Now, Kevin, you're a coder.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   Is that a lot?
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   Sounds like quite a lot to me.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   Yes.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   I mean, you know, lines of code is always a silly man.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   Yes, I agree.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   You know, it's just like, well, it depends our terms, your language.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.840]   It also encourages people to write ridiculous bell scripts that fit on one line, which is,
[00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:30.840]   which is not helpful.
[00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:31.840]   Right.
[00:12:31.840 --> 00:12:32.840]   That's not good either.
[00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:37.800]   Microsoft Windows, they estimate in the realm of 50, 50 million lines.
[00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:39.920]   This comes from Google's Rachel Potter.
[00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:40.920]   That surprises me.
[00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:42.560]   I think that's a low number.
[00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:44.840]   I don't think that's accurate.
[00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:47.320]   And I, it's, oh yeah.
[00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:48.320]   Absolutely.
[00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:49.320]   That's low.
[00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:50.320]   Modern operating.
[00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:51.800]   I bet you Chrome.
[00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:56.040]   I bet you Chrome is 50 million lines.
[00:12:56.040 --> 00:12:57.040]   Really?
[00:12:57.040 --> 00:12:58.600]   I would think it'd be more efficient than that.
[00:12:58.600 --> 00:13:00.200]   Well, lines doesn't mean anything.
[00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:01.200]   Yeah.
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:03.840]   That's not an efficiency as Kevin's pointing out.
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:07.000]   Some of those lines are comments.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   But Kevin's right there.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.520]   We lost the scarcity of space with memory.
[00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:15.000]   I remember way back when I worked on the services for examiner, we had SII terminals.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.400]   They were smart terminals for publishing.
[00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:22.600]   And when somebody put hyphenation and justification and managed to fit it locally in the terminal,
[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:24.600]   that was just, that was mind-blogging.
[00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:25.600]   That was possible.
[00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:26.600]   Absolutely mind-blogging.
[00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:27.600]   That could be done.
[00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:30.040]   And it could be done because there was such incredible efficiency in the code.
[00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:32.640]   Chromium, which is the open source version of Google Chrome.
[00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:38.200]   Of course, we can count the lines in the open source project is 17 million lines of code.
[00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:40.640]   That's for a browser alone.
[00:13:40.640 --> 00:13:43.280]   So 50 I think is low for Windows.
[00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:45.560]   But in any event, 2 billion, I don't know.
[00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:47.960]   Like Kevin says, doesn't really mean anything.
[00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:48.960]   But it's...
[00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:53.880]   Yes, there's a certain amount of going on here.
[00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:54.880]   She's...
[00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:58.560]   Rachel Potvin mentioned this at an engineering conference in Silicon Valley.
[00:13:58.560 --> 00:13:59.560]   It's an estimate.
[00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:01.600]   That includes Google search, Gmail, Google maps.
[00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:05.880]   Again, it's a rough estimate, although I suppose you could count them.
[00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:08.200]   They're in a single code repository.
[00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:10.080]   That to me is more interesting.
[00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:18.000]   All 25,000 Google engineers have access to the Google code repository.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:21.420]   She says, and I think this is probably the case, it's the single largest single code
[00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:24.000]   repository anywhere in the world.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   Wow.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   Okay.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.080]   That's a big deal, isn't it, Kevin?
[00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:31.680]   To put all of that code openly in a repository.
[00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:35.920]   It's like one repository that sounds a bit of an initial...
[00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:36.920]   Oh, it's GitHub.
[00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:40.520]   GitHub has a copy of it everywhere that it sits.
[00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:42.720]   Well, it's Git, run, Git Hub, yeah.
[00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:43.720]   It's Git, right?
[00:14:43.720 --> 00:14:45.080]   Yeah, not Git Hub, Git.
[00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:46.080]   I think it's Git.
[00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:48.440]   No, it wasn't Git when I was there, but that may have changed.
[00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:49.440]   It was...
[00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:50.440]   In the...
[00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:51.440]   It was...
[00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:52.440]   I wish...
[00:14:52.440 --> 00:14:53.200]   I bet they use Git.
[00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:54.680]   Do they use their own CV?
[00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:57.000]   There was a mixture of things.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:02.280]   There was some that was in Mercurial, and there was some that was in Perforce.
[00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:05.400]   I'm sure it's all moved to Git by now.
[00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:07.480]   They may want to move to Git by now, I don't know.
[00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:11.280]   They've done a big project to move a lot of the external facing stuff to Git, certainly.
[00:15:11.280 --> 00:15:12.280]   So did you...
[00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:14.720]   I mean, when you were there, could you access the repository?
[00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:16.120]   Yeah, yeah, of course.
[00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:17.120]   That was...
[00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:18.120]   I mean, that's true.
[00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:19.760]   The point is everyone can see the code.
[00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:22.720]   You've still got to send pull requests to people if you want to change things, but there's
[00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:23.720]   a process doing this.
[00:15:23.720 --> 00:15:24.720]   Yeah, I hope so.
[00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:29.320]   Well, there's a complicated process of different kinds of committers and who gets to commit
[00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:33.000]   things and you have to have what they call weed ability in different languages.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   Yeah.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:38.640]   You have to submit changes to something in certain languages.
[00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:40.120]   You have to prove your competence in that language.
[00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:43.320]   So there's a big peer process for this.
[00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:44.840]   Oh, this is interesting.
[00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:51.000]   So the main Facebook app is 20 million lines of code, according to this article.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.760]   And Facebook and Google are working on an open source version control system based on
[00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:57.760]   Mercurial.
[00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:03.560]   We're attempting to see if we can scale Mercurial to the size of the Google repository.
[00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:05.040]   Mm, there you go.
[00:16:05.040 --> 00:16:10.600]   So yeah, because they have been using Mercurial, which is the Python based.
[00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:17.680]   Explain to people who are not programmers what a code repository is.
[00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:23.840]   Well, the point of having a source code control system is that it doesn't just keep the current
[00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:24.840]   version of the code.
[00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:25.840]   That's useful.
[00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:29.080]   It keeps all the previous versions as well, and as you see, they've been checked in and
[00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:30.080]   out.
[00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:33.280]   And analogy would be the edit history you see on Wikipedia.
[00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:35.840]   So you can go back to any previous version of the code.
[00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:38.640]   You can see who made the changes.
[00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:41.480]   You can selectively also create what are called branches.
[00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:46.440]   So you say, OK, I want to go off and try a side project here that doesn't do it for
[00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:48.560]   everybody else's code.
[00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:49.560]   Work on that.
[00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:50.920]   And then when you're happy with it, bring it back in.
[00:16:50.920 --> 00:16:57.400]   So it's a model for doing lots and lots of edits on text in parallel and making sure
[00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:59.200]   they have all the versions of it.
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:01.760]   And this is obviously a core problem for programs.
[00:17:01.760 --> 00:17:06.000]   Before we had this, it was-- you were doing the same things people do with documents where
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:11.120]   you save version one, version two, and six, copies, and all that stuff.
[00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:15.760]   And if you-- no, it's also-- we get bits of this behind the scenes now in-- if you look
[00:17:15.760 --> 00:17:21.280]   at Google Docs or Word Strack changes and things like that, there is a sense that there
[00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:23.640]   are previous versions of the documents there.
[00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:25.600]   You know, Apple has previous versions of document--
[00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:27.520]   Conversion is very handy, yeah.
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:31.600]   But it's a hard problem.
[00:17:31.600 --> 00:17:34.360]   But a lot of computer science has been thrown out.
[00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:35.840]   So we've got good ways of doing it now.
[00:17:35.840 --> 00:17:39.080]   For years, everybody used subversion.
[00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:43.880]   Linus Torvalds famously dissatisfied with subversion with all the code repositories.
[00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:44.880]   And there was CVOS.
[00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:47.680]   Yeah, there's a whole chain of one of their peers.
[00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:53.040]   But the previous model was that you-- the idea was you would have locks on each file
[00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:54.040]   in the repository.
[00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:55.040]   You'd check it out.
[00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:56.040]   And then when you had it checked out, nobody could modify it.
[00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:57.040]   And you would check it back in again.
[00:17:57.040 --> 00:17:59.120]   But that was how CVS worked.
[00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:02.400]   And subversion was close to that.
[00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:09.040]   And the big change was with Git particularly and Mercurial as well does the same thing.
[00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:14.600]   Was the notion that merging should be so straightforward you can have multiple versions.
[00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:20.920]   So the idea is that most of the time you check stuff out and have your own copies and
[00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:23.040]   then you push stuff back in and it merges automatically.
[00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:27.280]   And it's only when there's a-- two of you have actually did the same line or something
[00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:30.560]   that you'll get in merge conflicts and you have to go and fix that.
[00:18:30.560 --> 00:18:35.400]   And so the source code control is now designed to be done deeply in parallel.
[00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:40.840]   But there was still a cultural sense of there should be one true version that you should
[00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:43.440]   get permission before checking things in and so on.
[00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:47.840]   But one of the things that GitHub changed was the institution of the first thing you
[00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:50.600]   do is fork the code and make your changes.
[00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:53.040]   And so both versions exist on the site.
[00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:56.560]   And then when you're done you send a pull request to say I've changed this.
[00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:57.560]   Here it is.
[00:18:57.560 --> 00:18:58.720]   You can go through and look at it.
[00:18:58.720 --> 00:19:02.840]   But in each case you're working in public with all the variations on a theme.
[00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:08.320]   And that was an interesting cultural shift in the way that open source worked.
[00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:14.040]   Because before that there was very much this culture of the benevolent dictator who decided
[00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:16.240]   whose code made it into the project.
[00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:19.120]   And that was done through main lists and so on.
[00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:28.440]   And that was why Linus built Git in the first place was to help him manage that process.
[00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:35.400]   But in effect the GitHub thing of making it all basically publishing your own fork by
[00:19:35.400 --> 00:19:38.280]   default does provide a different way of doing that.
[00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:41.960]   So you can instead of saying I'm going to go and argue with you about which version
[00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:46.080]   to go in the code you can just say here's my version take your own pick.
[00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:49.600]   So you can be passive aggressive about it or you can just put a version up there and
[00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:52.320]   then send a pull request saying I've made these changes.
[00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:53.320]   Right.
[00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:54.920]   You know tell me if you want one or not.
[00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:55.920]   Yeah.
[00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:56.920]   What do you think?
[00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:59.560]   But the point is both versions are available and people can decide between them.
[00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:06.560]   So before this forking a project was this like the only thing that only happens after
[00:20:06.560 --> 00:20:12.000]   a gigantic fight between the founders and usually causes all kinds of grief between
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.240]   the maintainers rather than the founders.
[00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:18.000]   And now forking is the thing you do first before you do the changes and then when you're
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.680]   all happy with what you've got you send it back.
[00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:25.920]   So it's an interesting nuance in how the associative changes by making more versions
[00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:26.920]   public.
[00:20:26.920 --> 00:20:30.280]   Did you get to feed the cat Jeff?
[00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:31.280]   Yes I did.
[00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:32.280]   Okay.
[00:20:32.280 --> 00:20:36.000]   I was trying to feed his cat so I asked Kevin.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:38.400]   You asked me something that would make me ramble.
[00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:40.560]   Something that would take a long time to answer.
[00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:43.320]   What is code versioning Kevin?
[00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:46.680]   How does that work?
[00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:52.880]   Linesofcode.org says they have there are people who have used code.org which is a great site
[00:20:52.880 --> 00:21:00.480]   for teaching kids and even some elders how to program lines of code in the code.org
[00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:03.960]   tutorial 7.4 million people have written code on code.org.
[00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:05.960]   I like that.
[00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:10.560]   Anyway two billion what I'm surprised at is that every engineer at Google has access.
[00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:15.920]   Isn't there a secret sauce a Coca-Cola recipe in there somewhere?
[00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:20.640]   Well you know not in a compact format the Coca-Cola recipe.
[00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:23.640]   The thing is that a lot of it is.
[00:21:23.640 --> 00:21:28.720]   Wouldn't you worry about somebody just kind of copying it and going to Yahoo?
[00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:33.000]   But the thing is you can't you know we have this conversation we were open sourcing things
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:37.280]   when I was there and the problem is well you can't really run this code without Google's
[00:21:37.280 --> 00:21:38.280]   infrastructure.
[00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:40.720]   It's not just the code is it?
[00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:43.760]   It's not written well it's the code but it's the way you know they've got all these systems
[00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:47.880]   that run on multiple computers in parallel you know map reduce and all the other things
[00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:51.880]   that they've produced out there and some of them some of those have been released but
[00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:52.880]   a lot of them haven't.
[00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:56.440]   And so there's this giant infrastructure that spins up machines on oven demand and
[00:21:56.440 --> 00:21:59.560]   spawns processes and makes stuff flow back and forth.
[00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:02.840]   And so there was you know at the time he was like well why don't you open source the search
[00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:07.760]   algorithm it's like well the search algorithm isn't any use to you unless you got.
[00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:14.720]   All this other infrastructure and be got a copy of the web on your servers.
[00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:19.600]   So if you need to make a trip in New York to get something just let me know and I'll
[00:22:19.600 --> 00:22:26.240]   ask you what map reduces and actually map reduces kind of magical but I don't think
[00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:30.200]   we have time on this show.
[00:22:30.200 --> 00:22:32.200]   Let's talk about something.
[00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:34.800]   I can give you a short version of it.
[00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:36.400]   Okay let's see.
[00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:38.400]   I'll start the timer.
[00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:41.720]   Kevin Marks MapReduce Go.
[00:22:41.720 --> 00:22:48.840]   So the basic idea of MapReduce is instead of building a database to store things you
[00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:54.040]   store the data in the original format and construct databases when you need them.
[00:22:54.040 --> 00:23:00.920]   And so the classical database model is you design the database build indexes and ask
[00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:02.760]   then you can ask it questions.
[00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:07.600]   MapReduce but if you want to actually touch the whole database it will be very slow because
[00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:09.280]   you have to go for a bunch of indexes.
[00:23:09.280 --> 00:23:13.360]   Each read and write takes a lot of touching indexes and things because it's designed to
[00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:15.120]   be able to be flexible.
[00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:19.120]   And MapReduce sort of turns that around and says okay we want to go through this data
[00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:20.600]   set and make some sense of it.
[00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:25.600]   So we will read every entry in the data set once and perform the operation on that and
[00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:27.120]   that's the map phase.
[00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:31.120]   Then you've got this giant intermediate product which is although basically that operation
[00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:34.120]   can run on every entry in the database.
[00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:37.280]   Then you do what's called a shuffle which is the bit that people don't talk about which
[00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:39.360]   sorts them into some order.
[00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:42.440]   And then you do a reduced phase where you collate those back together.
[00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:46.880]   So if you're counting the number of words in the document, the current is a particular
[00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:50.200]   word in the document, you run a little program in the map phase that finds documents that
[00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:52.440]   have that word in.
[00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:55.840]   Then the shuffle phase you organize them together and then reduce phase you go through
[00:23:55.840 --> 00:24:01.080]   and output all the documents that have that word in most frequently and that's your
[00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:06.160]   sort of the count of how many times per document they occur and that's your answer to the
[00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:07.160]   query.
[00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:09.160]   It sounds like a compression algorithm.
[00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:18.000]   It's more a way of doing it like a large transformation on the data.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:19.680]   And classically this isn't something you do.
[00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:24.280]   Classically with databases you put data into databases and then ask the database about
[00:24:24.280 --> 00:24:25.280]   it.
[00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:28.280]   And the process of importing data into the database is something you do once and it's
[00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:32.200]   this horrible code you write once and everybody hates doing it but once you've done that then
[00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:34.360]   you've got an official way of updating the databases.
[00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:40.320]   And MapReduce sort of turns that backwards and says the script that translates the free
[00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:44.720]   form data into the database is the bit that you spend the effort on and the database's
[00:24:44.720 --> 00:24:48.720]   disposable output of that because you can always run this thing again and adjust it.
[00:24:48.720 --> 00:24:49.720]   So it's...
[00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:54.640]   >> Google, I'm sure they didn't invent the concept but they're quite famous for their
[00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:56.240]   MapReduce algorithm.
[00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:57.240]   That was...
[00:24:57.240 --> 00:25:00.640]   I'm sure they completely invented the concept but it was the thing that they...
[00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:03.880]   It sort of spawned the idea of big data but I think that's a misnomer.
[00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:05.400]   It's more about messy data.
[00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:10.080]   The problem is the classic database thing is you're assuming the data...
[00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:14.480]   You're putting a data model and organizing the world to fit that data model and then
[00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:17.680]   the exercise is constructing the great data model and then working out how to get the
[00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:21.200]   data into it and then working what questions you ask of it.
[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:24.480]   Whereas from Google's point of view they were starting with the web which is like the most
[00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:27.840]   giant collection of random bits of text in the world.
[00:25:27.840 --> 00:25:33.400]   And so they were trying to construct new meaning from that which meant that they knew
[00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:37.040]   the source of the data was always going to be messy and it was going to be growing all
[00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:38.040]   the time.
[00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:42.880]   So having a process of finding that order was the important part of it.
[00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:49.240]   And so they built this process and at scale it was hard too but the scale isn't the key
[00:25:49.240 --> 00:25:54.000]   part of this process way of thinking because you can computers get faster and get more
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.560]   in capacity.
[00:25:55.560 --> 00:26:00.600]   It's more rethinking the way you're thinking about data in the first place to say it's
[00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:02.920]   not a big data problem, it's a messy data problem.
[00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:05.520]   So what signal are we looking for this data?
[00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:09.200]   We'll run the MapReduce and extract that, see what we get with the assumption you'll
[00:26:09.200 --> 00:26:15.280]   keep changing that MapReduce processing to do more things in the future and you'll get
[00:26:15.280 --> 00:26:17.120]   other versions of this database out.
[00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:20.720]   So it is a different world view.
[00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:25.080]   But it's one of those things that's part of the Google induction is they explain all
[00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:27.760]   this process to you and how it works.
[00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:36.240]   And it is sort of now there's third party ways of doing this, there's Hadoop and other
[00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:39.160]   MapReduce-like processes and things like that as well.
[00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:41.680]   But it is a very much different way of thinking about things.
[00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:46.400]   And for a while that was very much Google's competitive advantage, it was not so much
[00:26:46.400 --> 00:26:50.680]   that they had all these resources but they had a way of approaching problems that other
[00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:53.240]   people hadn't thought of to use yet.
[00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:56.760]   And that has now trickled out and there are other people who use that methodology.
[00:26:56.760 --> 00:27:02.600]   But it's a different way of thinking about data.
[00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:03.600]   Moving on.
[00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:07.800]   No, no, I love this stuff.
[00:27:07.800 --> 00:27:12.000]   And I've been having a hard time wrapping my head around MapReduce so I'm glad you
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.200]   explained it so succinctly.
[00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:21.920]   Have you Jeff downloaded Apple's iOS 9 yet and taken a look at their new...
[00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:26.680]   No, I have not because I've got to do it on my pod.
[00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:28.240]   Oh God.
[00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:30.120]   I mean, iPhones.
[00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:31.120]   That's a phone I think.
[00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:32.120]   No, it's not.
[00:27:32.120 --> 00:27:33.120]   It's an iPod Touch.
[00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:34.120]   iPod Touch.
[00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:35.120]   Okay.
[00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:37.360]   Yeah, so now I have an iPod Touch that I use for running iOS as well.
[00:27:37.360 --> 00:27:39.360]   Cut that sad.
[00:27:39.360 --> 00:27:41.120]   It's like...
[00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:42.120]   All right.
[00:27:42.120 --> 00:27:45.280]   Well, I don't want to play another phone contract.
[00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:46.280]   Right.
[00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:47.280]   Why not?
[00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:49.160]   Yeah, there's where I went wrong.
[00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:50.760]   I keep getting new phones.
[00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:54.720]   I should just stop and get some non-phone stuff.
[00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:58.800]   Of course, this is a new platform for news.
[00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:00.800]   Facebook's done it as well.
[00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:05.000]   Google and Twitter are now supposedly teaming up for instant articles.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:08.400]   Are all these the same kind of thing?
[00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:14.120]   I just had a column for this in the Observer, in New York's Observer, and yes, to the extent
[00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:17.880]   that their radical distribution of content, the content's going to go to the people, the
[00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:20.480]   people aren't going to go to the content.
[00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:23.160]   Instant articles we talked about a lot on the show, everybody knows what that is.
[00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:28.960]   This Google thing, which is still officially reported, you know, reportedly, but it's happening,
[00:28:28.960 --> 00:28:30.560]   is very, very interesting.
[00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:38.120]   And I'm going to make an analogy that's probably not technically true, but conceptually true.
[00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:46.280]   And IO, Google showed custom Chrome tabs that allowed you to a developer to preload and
[00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:52.040]   preload a browser and pre-fetch content into it so that when a user clicked on it, there
[00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:53.320]   would be a poem right there.
[00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:58.000]   So it's solving the same fundamental usability problem that Facebook is solving, which Facebook
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:01.280]   are using, Mark argues, is speed.
[00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:04.360]   But Google is doing this as an open standard.
[00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:09.040]   And this is a discussion that I've had openly and here on the show, when I got back from
[00:29:09.040 --> 00:29:16.840]   Newsgeist, the news, Google, confab, the last held in Helsinki, there was a lot of discussion
[00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:20.240]   with this because Instant articles just come out and I was one of the ones in the room
[00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:24.280]   who said, "Okay, Google, sorry I said that, folks."
[00:29:24.280 --> 00:29:25.280]   Okay, Siri.
[00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:27.920]   You've been in wake up.
[00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:31.840]   Okay, Google.
[00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:35.880]   You've been one-upped, so with the creation now, "Now, what are you going to do?"
[00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:38.720]   And the thing I would, I don't say that, listen to me, I'm not saying it's probably already
[00:29:38.720 --> 00:29:44.040]   in the works forever, but I said, "Why don't you do an open source version of Instant
[00:29:44.040 --> 00:29:46.200]   articles that this kind of distributed structure?"
[00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:47.680]   I've been arguing for for years.
[00:29:47.680 --> 00:29:52.080]   I think I wrote my first piece like four or five years ago arguing that this is the ultimate
[00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:55.880]   extension of the link economy, that rather than forcing people to link to our sites,
[00:29:55.880 --> 00:30:00.280]   they click to our sites, that we go to them, we embed our content wherever it is.
[00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:03.760]   That's in the Facebook flow, it's going to be in sites everywhere.
[00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:08.000]   So yes, the Apple news thing is one more piece of that where you owe to your audience
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.760]   where they are, whether that's in Snapchat, whether that's in Apple, whether that's on
[00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:15.320]   Facebook, whether that's on other sites.
[00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:21.200]   And I can see a world here where the Washington Post can do a deal with the New York Times
[00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:23.400]   and say, "What the hell?
[00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:27.000]   We'll pre-fetch all of our stuff."
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:32.200]   And our own ads stay with our own content, our own hand incidentally, ad blockers will
[00:30:32.200 --> 00:30:33.680]   stop working, right?
[00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:34.680]   No.
[00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:36.840]   Do style blockers work on this content?
[00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:37.840]   I would better will.
[00:30:37.840 --> 00:30:41.600]   I would better be doing that's part of the game of this.
[00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:44.880]   Is that ad blockers won't or will work?
[00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:47.120]   Well, so part of what's going on again.
[00:30:47.120 --> 00:30:50.280]   If it's a cached image of the page.
[00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:54.960]   We're not sure what's cached and what's going to be have to be fed live.
[00:30:54.960 --> 00:30:57.920]   So the one, among the questions that have not been answered yet about this is exactly
[00:30:57.920 --> 00:30:58.920]   that question.
[00:30:58.920 --> 00:30:59.920]   So the content can be everything.
[00:30:59.920 --> 00:31:02.720]   Everything will look like it'll be from first party if it's cached.
[00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:06.320]   But if the ads aren't cached, then that will be blockable.
[00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:10.160]   And the reason they may not be able to be cached, I think, and this is just me, especially
[00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:11.600]   because you won't get metrics.
[00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:14.400]   Well, no, you could still have a ping back.
[00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:15.640]   So here's to me the choice.
[00:31:15.640 --> 00:31:17.200]   And again, this is just me blathering here.
[00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:20.640]   I have no knowledge of this particularly.
[00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:22.280]   I see two choices.
[00:31:22.280 --> 00:31:26.040]   One is to cache the ad, but then to write a ping back in this structure.
[00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:28.840]   So it will ping back at the servers that it was seen.
[00:31:28.840 --> 00:31:33.080]   What if this content was cached two weeks ago?
[00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:37.760]   And what if you have programmatic advertising, which is and retargeting advertising, which
[00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:40.120]   is supposed to, which is trying to go to you exactly.
[00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:43.320]   But it can't because it just becomes a one size fits all ad for everybody because it
[00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:46.960]   got cached into a page and you don't know who's going to call it up.
[00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:51.640]   Now if you do serve the ads live, the problem is you're back to square one in terms of
[00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:54.920]   the speed problem because that's what slows down all these pages.
[00:31:54.920 --> 00:31:58.600]   So I do not know what they're going to do about this.
[00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:03.000]   So yeah, there's serving the ads live isn't intrinsically showing the pages down.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.360]   Google serves the ads live, but they do it very well.
[00:32:05.360 --> 00:32:14.080]   It's more that my sense is that we're in the stage that when the credit for swaps thing
[00:32:14.080 --> 00:32:16.040]   happened, it made money for a while.
[00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:18.040]   And then the margins were going down.
[00:32:18.040 --> 00:32:22.000]   So they doubled up on the kinds of credit for swaps they were doing until it got it out
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   of hand.
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:26.200]   And I sense we're in that phase with web advertising where you used to be able to make
[00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:28.240]   money just by sticking ad sense in there.
[00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:30.400]   And now it's like, oh, that does not make enough money.
[00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:31.400]   Let's stick something in there.
[00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:35.120]   Let's stick this next thing in there, which is how you get used websites where you open
[00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:39.440]   the page and it downloads several megabytes of JavaScript from a bunch of random sites
[00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:41.600]   you've never heard of before.
[00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:46.360]   And so Google's interest may well be to sort of strip those out and replace them with
[00:32:46.360 --> 00:32:49.400]   their own ads and say, look, we'll just put the put ours in because we know what we're
[00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:50.400]   doing.
[00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:52.680]   And there's obviously the publisher won't allow that.
[00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:56.840]   The publishers may not allow that, but that's the question.
[00:32:56.840 --> 00:32:59.240]   I mean, do you remember Google fast flip?
[00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:00.240]   No.
[00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:01.240]   Oh, yeah.
[00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:03.480]   What was that?
[00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:06.240]   So Google fast flip was previous attempt at this.
[00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:07.240]   What was this like?
[00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:09.400]   Sounds like a circus act.
[00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:12.400]   Something on AGT.
[00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:16.560]   So basically what they did was they rendered the pages as bitmaps.
[00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:22.920]   So they would download a, like load the web page in a browser on Linux and rip it to a
[00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:28.320]   bitmap and then serve you that instead because that was faster than rendering the HTML from
[00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:29.320]   all these sites.
[00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:31.720]   Yeah, that's what this sounds like, but it's not.
[00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:33.200]   Am I assuming they're not doing that this time?
[00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:36.400]   No, they're prefetching the whole page because the idea here is behind this.
[00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:42.040]   And this is what, and don't forget, this is around this digital news initiative.
[00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:44.520]   And so it's going to be trying to be nice to publishers.
[00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:46.880]   It's not going to be offensive to publishers.
[00:33:46.880 --> 00:33:48.400]   That's the given of this.
[00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:50.520]   So the publishers say it's gone now.
[00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:52.400]   Oh, my geez.
[00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:54.280]   It's gone in a big way.
[00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:55.280]   Yeah.
[00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:58.680]   Oh, they didn't even bother with a fancy URL.
[00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:01.160]   Oh, that's because it's Google Labs, which is also gone.
[00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:02.360]   It was a Google Labs thing.
[00:34:02.360 --> 00:34:03.360]   Yeah.
[00:34:03.360 --> 00:34:05.200]   But this was one, which is on there.
[00:34:05.200 --> 00:34:09.240]   They want their, the publishers want their ads served on their pages.
[00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:11.480]   They want their analytics and their brand.
[00:34:11.480 --> 00:34:12.720]   And they want their look and feel.
[00:34:12.720 --> 00:34:18.640]   Yeah, but we're entering a world of today begins the ad block ellips.
[00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:19.640]   I agree.
[00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:20.640]   Absolutely.
[00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:22.120]   But, but you know, I've been thinking about that.
[00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:24.760]   I've been trying to work on a post about this.
[00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:27.160]   We should mention that's because iOS 9 comes out today.
[00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:30.560]   Apple will finally allow ad blocking in mobile Safari.
[00:34:30.560 --> 00:34:34.240]   There are already at least three different programs, including Crystal, that will do
[00:34:34.240 --> 00:34:35.240]   that.
[00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:38.040]   And I'm sure they'll be very popular on the app store.
[00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:41.040]   The real problem with blocking ads as soon as you once you do it, you never want to
[00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:42.040]   go back.
[00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:43.040]   Yeah.
[00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:48.240]   And I wrote a piece for the user of Rob Dooley that weekly now on this and argued that the
[00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:51.720]   I can argue as we have on this show, we've had this discussion on the show that you're
[00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:54.760]   stealing candy from the mouths of journalists by using ad blockers.
[00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:58.360]   But but the truth is we screwed it up advertising is so I think they brought it up.
[00:34:58.360 --> 00:34:59.360]   So we were so slow.
[00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:01.440]   Yeah, it brought it on.
[00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:05.560]   So what we have to do so, so, you know, what I wrote about what I called an emotion
[00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:11.600]   X-lax cycle here, a block in the block.
[00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:13.120]   Remember pop up blockers?
[00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:17.560]   Yeah, pop up ads got so annoying that every browser built in pop up blockers, they all
[00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:19.040]   have them now.
[00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:21.040]   Nobody said that's the end of the web.
[00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:24.560]   But this is a little more global than that.
[00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:25.560]   Right.
[00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:31.000]   So that blocked like just in one form of annoying advertising, this blocks it all, including
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.440]   in most cases, all analytics.
[00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:36.640]   And the Washington Post half the people are doing are doing because they don't want to
[00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:37.640]   see ads.
[00:35:37.640 --> 00:35:40.040]   The other half are doing because they don't want to be tracked.
[00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:43.240]   Well, the best because the the apps rely on tracking.
[00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:44.880]   I mean, that's the most annoying app.
[00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:46.200]   So the ones that storky around the web.
[00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:50.200]   So, you know, every time you touch a page, people want to block a whole damn thing.
[00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:56.320]   But on the other hand, Kevin, on the other hand, irrelevant advertising is also irritating.
[00:35:56.320 --> 00:35:59.520]   The problem is it's stupid, relevant advertising, right?
[00:35:59.520 --> 00:36:02.880]   You know, the boots, you see the boots on Amazon, the boots fall you around.
[00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:04.880]   Long after you bought the friggin boots.
[00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:05.880]   Right.
[00:36:05.880 --> 00:36:06.880]   Yes.
[00:36:06.880 --> 00:36:11.320]   And so it's not just so much creepy as it is incredibly dumb.
[00:36:11.320 --> 00:36:15.280]   And so we've got to fix advertising at the essence.
[00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:20.960]   We've got to make it relevant and useful and informative and engaging again.
[00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:23.520]   The only way to be relevant is if I know something about you.
[00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:25.480]   Well, that's the creepy line.
[00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:26.480]   That's privacy.
[00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:27.480]   We've got to figure out.
[00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:31.120]   I think we need to find a way to find a structure for consensual.
[00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:36.920]   The Eli Patel tweeted, it's Apple's attempt to kill Google's revenue tonight.
[00:36:36.920 --> 00:36:37.920]   It is.
[00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:38.920]   I absolutely agree.
[00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:41.920]   Because Apple, by the way, will not block ads in mobile apps.
[00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:43.520]   That's what it says.
[00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:44.520]   It's the sales.
[00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:45.520]   Right.
[00:36:45.520 --> 00:36:47.440]   Apple was supposed to become an ad giant.
[00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:48.440]   It never did.
[00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:49.440]   It failed.
[00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:51.640]   So it's going to ruin it for everybody else.
[00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:55.760]   There's a moral has the ad blockers on both sides have moral hazards.
[00:36:55.760 --> 00:37:00.960]   The the the the ad block plus and all that has been called by many often and I agree racketeering
[00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:04.640]   because they charge you for the whitelist and we do not recommend that block plus.
[00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:07.640]   That's not our choice in any respect.
[00:37:07.640 --> 00:37:09.440]   And then in this world, Apple has a more.
[00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:10.440]   It's also not very good.
[00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:11.440]   It's not a rule.
[00:37:11.440 --> 00:37:13.680]   You block origin is the one that we've talked about.
[00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:17.480]   We've you know, Steve gives it did a whole thing on security now.
[00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:20.400]   Once you start using it, you will never stop.
[00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:22.480]   Everything loads fast.
[00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:24.200]   It's not even about not seeing ads for me.
[00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:27.760]   It's about how fast the pages load how uncluttered they are.
[00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:33.600]   That's what both instant articles and this new right right now.
[00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:39.200]   I mean, my friend, Tantek runs his browser with JavaScript turned off by default so that
[00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:43.080]   everything loads quickly and it also helps and see which people are like not using the
[00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:45.000]   web sees a no guy.
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.920]   But it's hard to do that very long.
[00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:49.440]   You run no script to pretty soon.
[00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:53.320]   You realize that you've turned off pretty much everything on the web or you can you can like
[00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:54.560]   turn little bits back on again.
[00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:57.640]   Yeah, you have to otherwise even our own site.
[00:37:57.640 --> 00:38:01.880]   Well, work with that JavaScript.
[00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:07.080]   But that's the I mean, but you know, so part of this is the is the is the is the is the
[00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:08.080]   ad things.
[00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:14.280]   One of the one of the talks at XO XO this weekend was Heather Armstrong, do's talking
[00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:19.840]   about how she gave up blogging because of the things she was expected to do for advertising
[00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:24.640]   now because she used to be able to write what she wanted and fund it with the banner ads,
[00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:31.840]   that she had in order to make the money, she had to do what they call native native content
[00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:32.840]   advertising.
[00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:37.600]   It's a shame because Duce's blog was one of the proto blogs is one of the great blogs.
[00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:38.600]   Yeah.
[00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:41.400]   I didn't know she was going to have to give it up.
[00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:44.680]   Well, she tells she tells those two and I won't you know, the video will be up soon.
[00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:46.200]   So I take our punch lines away.
[00:38:46.200 --> 00:38:51.760]   But basically she ended up saying that she was being forced to editorially compromise
[00:38:51.760 --> 00:38:54.680]   what she wanted to write by the people who were subsidizing it.
[00:38:54.680 --> 00:39:00.240]   She was being expected to like go and you know, do things with her kids and take photographs
[00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:04.280]   of them using the products and all the money bloggers in particular are subject to a lot
[00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:05.600]   of that pressure.
[00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:07.520]   She couldn't resist the pressure though.
[00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:08.520]   Well, she did.
[00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:09.520]   That was the point.
[00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:10.520]   That's why she stopped.
[00:39:10.520 --> 00:39:11.520]   That's that's too bad.
[00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:17.360]   But this is so she uses federated media now to sell advertising on her site.
[00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:21.280]   She used well, she federated media was part of the part of the discussion.
[00:39:21.280 --> 00:39:25.320]   Anyway, I don't want to you know, reiterate her whole talk.
[00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:27.320]   But we do wait and see when that comes up.
[00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:32.560]   But the point is that it was very much a this is sort of led to part of my sense that
[00:39:32.560 --> 00:39:37.440]   we have this problem where or match it.
[00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:42.120]   Shekrovsky describes it as we don't really have advertising value.
[00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:44.920]   We have investor story time value where you tell your investors that you're going to
[00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:47.720]   make lots of money from advertising in the future from this stuff.
[00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:54.520]   But in practice, it doesn't make that much because there is a gap between the you know,
[00:39:54.520 --> 00:39:57.920]   because there is a saturation curve in what looks like an exponential curve and we're
[00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:00.600]   sitting at that now without advertising and that is a challenge.
[00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:04.520]   I think that and the challenge for you know, my point of view on the challenge is we just
[00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:08.080]   find other ways of paying for content than advertising.
[00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:09.960]   No, I disagree.
[00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:16.520]   There isn't enough money Kevin to support what we what we need and have and journalism
[00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:20.440]   will be supported that way because journalism is information rich and information is immediately
[00:40:20.440 --> 00:40:22.480]   commodified as soon as it's known.
[00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:27.000]   So so this idea that that that we should be paid for our content the way that HBO is
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:29.560]   paid for Game of Thrones.
[00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:32.440]   We're in completely different businesses and the models are completely different.
[00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:34.120]   And I don't agree that paying for content is going to work.
[00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:38.200]   The other problem with paying for content is it red lines journalism and red lines knowledge
[00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:41.480]   and only those who can afford it get it and democracy.
[00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:42.480]   That's big trouble.
[00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:43.480]   But that's that's the point.
[00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:50.360]   That's why I'm saying we need to be paying for content but not gate gate keeping content.
[00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:55.400]   It's the it's the we need to reinvent the brought brought to you by viewers like you
[00:40:55.400 --> 00:40:58.840]   model of I am paying so other people can see this.
[00:40:58.840 --> 00:40:59.920]   That's part of it.
[00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:03.160]   But we also have to I don't think we can give up yet on advertising.
[00:41:03.160 --> 00:41:07.320]   I think that happens given up and Merocks given up but the rest of us can't.
[00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:08.720]   No, I'm not saying you can.
[00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:12.120]   Yes, I'm saying it's it's down to technologists like me to think about ways of doing this
[00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:13.120]   better.
[00:41:13.120 --> 00:41:14.120]   Yes, yes.
[00:41:14.120 --> 00:41:19.160]   At the point where advertising is paying you a thousandth of a cent per viewer, you're
[00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:20.160]   already in trouble.
[00:41:20.160 --> 00:41:24.080]   And that's why we end up with these sites that are full of like, you know, several
[00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:28.880]   megs of different advertising desperately trying to claw a few more micro sense.
[00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:29.880]   I see you.
[00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:35.360]   Whereas we have that's why we have the the the the eight thousand versions of the same
[00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:36.360]   story.
[00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:39.320]   800 people who are going to the debate tonight, journalists as if they're all going to have
[00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:42.920]   their own special, wonderful, unique perspective.
[00:41:42.920 --> 00:41:44.840]   No, they all want their own take.
[00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:45.960]   So they get their own add on it.
[00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:48.160]   So they get their own pennies from that.
[00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:50.760]   And we don't reward original work.
[00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:52.960]   We don't reward real reporting.
[00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:58.200]   We reward an old business model, an old mass media business model of volume.
[00:41:58.200 --> 00:41:59.200]   Yes.
[00:41:59.200 --> 00:42:00.200]   No, exactly.
[00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:01.200]   And so that's what I'm getting at.
[00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:04.840]   So the point is if one person likes you thinking after send you $10 that outweighs a
[00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:08.600]   hundred thousand ad views or more.
[00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:09.600]   Yeah.
[00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:10.600]   And I'm not, I'm not against that.
[00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:13.120]   I'm not all against it, but I'm just, I'm just arguing we've seen this argument for micro
[00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:14.120]   payments for blend.
[00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:17.760]   What you end up getting is wall street journal in the financial times.
[00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:20.520]   And what you don't get is to I think it's supplemental.
[00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:25.760]   I think it's supplemental, but it will not fundamentally pay what we need to pay for the
[00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:27.640]   amount of Avenue that's, that's there.
[00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:32.760]   And again, a lot of us inefficient and wasted and repetitive and I got other problems here,
[00:42:32.760 --> 00:42:36.480]   but I say job one is to fix and rethink advertising.
[00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:37.960]   No, see, it's okay.
[00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:41.200]   We can, we can agree disagree because I think job one is to replace advertising with something
[00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:45.720]   that, that doesn't have as many perverse incentives.
[00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:48.040]   I think we're going to supplement advertising with those things.
[00:42:48.040 --> 00:42:49.800]   So we can agree to agree on that.
[00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:50.800]   But I don't think that.
[00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:52.160]   What about Google contributor?
[00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:54.200]   Is that a good, all the kind of middle ground?
[00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:58.800]   So how much Google should say I'm going to bet you that the amount of money from Google
[00:42:58.800 --> 00:43:01.480]   contributor is, is below the minimis.
[00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:03.280]   Yeah, I think it's probably true.
[00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:05.520]   No, but it has the same micro payment problem.
[00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:10.760]   Whereas, you know, if you look at the money from Kickstarter, that, that can actually do
[00:43:10.760 --> 00:43:14.840]   these things because it can carry us to pay an actual sensible amount of money rather
[00:43:14.840 --> 00:43:18.800]   than a fraction of a, of a cent that you have to track it all the sites you go to.
[00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:22.920]   So the, the question is, can you, can we find a way to encourage that kind of model for,
[00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:26.720]   for news rather than just manufacturing things as well?
[00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:32.080]   So that's, there are those who say advertising, you don't, you pay for advertising, you pay
[00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:37.600]   for the advertising through paying higher prices for the advertiser.
[00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:41.600]   Well, but in a competitive marketplace, you end up paying less.
[00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:49.040]   You know, I believe me, I've had these conversations at, I had nauseam and I'm sure those of our
[00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:51.920]   audience who watch all of our shows would agree.
[00:43:51.920 --> 00:43:58.200]   But, you know, we have a model, I know for a fact, well, I don't know for a fact, but
[00:43:58.200 --> 00:44:04.480]   I have some evidence, considerable amount that we could not do a paywall and still survive.
[00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:05.480]   No, quit.
[00:44:05.480 --> 00:44:10.040]   So advertising works well for us, but we have been very careful to respect our audience
[00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:11.480]   with the advertising that we do.
[00:44:11.480 --> 00:44:16.520]   We, Kevin, Kevin, where we, we absolutely agree is I had an event at CUNY in my school
[00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:17.960]   two weeks ago in membership.
[00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:21.640]   And I argue we've got to look at right now in media, we see membership is another word
[00:44:21.640 --> 00:44:22.640]   for subscription.
[00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:23.640]   Give us money.
[00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:25.640]   We've got to see ways to serve new tribes.
[00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:27.240]   We've got to see ways to serve new tribes.
[00:44:27.240 --> 00:44:32.240]   We've got to have new ways that people contribute to value to us besides just cash, which includes
[00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:34.920]   marketing and expertise and information.
[00:44:34.920 --> 00:44:38.880]   And we've got to give people new rewards besides just access to content, social status.
[00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:43.440]   What would you do if you were me, just I'm curious, either one of you.
[00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:47.160]   What financial models should I have going forward?
[00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:56.480]   Well, as the challenge, I mean, the challenge is, well, so there's one thing here is there
[00:44:56.480 --> 00:45:01.040]   is an inherent assumption in a lot of these arguments is that there is a single price.
[00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:04.160]   And this is the, this is a sort of shibboleth of economics that there is a single price
[00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:05.160]   for things.
[00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:08.960]   And if you try and have differentiated prices, then that will fail for you.
[00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:12.560]   So you draw your price demand curve and you find the sweet spot between how many people
[00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:17.080]   pay us a dollar and how many people will pay us at 100% or whatever.
[00:45:17.080 --> 00:45:21.840]   And the thing that I think is fascinating about the Kickstarter experience and patreon
[00:45:21.840 --> 00:45:26.400]   and some of these other ones is that they're at all, you know, humble bundle, you know,
[00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:27.640]   there are several of these things.
[00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:31.320]   And what they say is, well, what is it worth you?
[00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:32.520]   How much do you want to give?
[00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:39.760]   And this is sort of dropping back to the sort of the public media thing of what level are
[00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:40.760]   you contributing at?
[00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:42.800]   How much do you want to support us and so on.
[00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:47.800]   And the point of that is it's not so much you're selling variable prices is you're giving
[00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:50.840]   people permission to pay a different amount and a reason to do this.
[00:45:50.840 --> 00:45:52.560]   So an emotional reason to do so.
[00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:55.800]   And I think understanding how that works is going to be interesting.
[00:45:55.800 --> 00:46:00.600]   And you see that sometimes with the musicians and other artists where they will say, hey,
[00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:02.600]   what you think it's worth.
[00:46:02.600 --> 00:46:06.200]   And the experience of most musicians is that that works very well.
[00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:08.440]   Was it that did that with there?
[00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:09.440]   Was it nine inch nails?
[00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:10.440]   One of their albums.
[00:46:10.440 --> 00:46:11.840]   Yeah, so it's a bit of that.
[00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:16.960]   And Zoe Keating publishes her how much she gets paid on different systems and things and
[00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:20.440]   talks about this event and says, yeah, there are people who will pay me 500 dollars for
[00:46:20.440 --> 00:46:22.480]   an album because they like what I do.
[00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:23.480]   They love you.
[00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:24.480]   Yes.
[00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:27.040]   And Amanda Palmer, Amanda Palmer has gone that way too.
[00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:28.040]   And I agree.
[00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:29.040]   But look at look at public.
[00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:30.040]   Fine.
[00:46:30.040 --> 00:46:31.040]   Look at public media.
[00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:32.400]   They that's how they work, isn't it?
[00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:33.400]   Not well.
[00:46:33.400 --> 00:46:35.600]   But advertising is absolutely vital towards survival.
[00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:36.600]   Right.
[00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:39.640]   They have huge ad sales more and more all the time.
[00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:43.840]   10% of the audience pays for the content.
[00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:51.320]   I can no longer distinguish between whatever that is they call in public media and ad.
[00:46:51.320 --> 00:46:54.320]   It sounds exactly like an ad.
[00:46:54.320 --> 00:47:00.880]   My advice to you is that you already have the model and I don't like native advertising
[00:47:00.880 --> 00:47:02.880]   when it tries to fool people.
[00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:07.600]   But advertising that is in the flow that you frankly can't get away from that works.
[00:47:07.600 --> 00:47:08.960]   And that's what you already have.
[00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:11.840]   So you're already way, way, way ahead of the advertising model.
[00:47:11.840 --> 00:47:15.540]   You know, Apple has introduced a new ad blocking feature which nobody recognizes an ad
[00:47:15.540 --> 00:47:17.880]   blocking feature in its Apple TV.
[00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:20.400]   Skip seven minutes.
[00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:25.760]   They have a variable length skip built into Apple TV via voice.
[00:47:25.760 --> 00:47:28.880]   And that's why I didn't know that one because that is an ad blunder.
[00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:33.880]   Remember when the DVRs were yeah, replay TV got put out of business for that.
[00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:35.320]   They got students to death.
[00:47:35.320 --> 00:47:36.320]   Yeah.
[00:47:36.320 --> 00:47:39.720]   And the other thing that I think about reprogram the button.
[00:47:39.720 --> 00:47:41.200]   Yeah, Tivo hit it.
[00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:47.800]   They just had a Easter egg 30 second skip replay actually had a 30 second skip button.
[00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:49.600]   They're gone.
[00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:53.920]   And the app, but Apple has enough market cloud that they can do that.
[00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:54.920]   Yes.
[00:47:54.920 --> 00:48:00.080]   Well, unless there are efforts in fact right now in Europe, Springer who led the fight
[00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:04.280]   against Google is also fighting against adblock and they're going to court.
[00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:05.280]   Good luck.
[00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:07.840]   I don't think unblocking the blockers is going to win.
[00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:09.640]   I don't think suing is going to win in the end.
[00:48:09.640 --> 00:48:12.040]   But I think we should try it in any way is fine.
[00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:13.720]   I think Apple could be vulnerable here.
[00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:16.480]   I think that people go after Google all the time and antitrust.
[00:48:16.480 --> 00:48:21.040]   It's Apple that's operating to a moral hazard in these cases when it comes to the advertising
[00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:22.040]   business.
[00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:23.040]   Yeah.
[00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:24.960]   The other piece that you have, and I know you played with this in terms of you've had
[00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:26.400]   contribute buttons, which are nice.
[00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:28.360]   Yeah, we're grateful to bring it in.
[00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:29.760]   We started with that only.
[00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:33.840]   We said, I said, I won't do ads for the first couple of years.
[00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:39.440]   Public broadcasting model I'm told is that about 4% of the audience will contribute.
[00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:40.440]   You have to.
[00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:41.440]   Somewhere between four and nine.
[00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:44.640]   You have to harass them to death for that.
[00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:45.840]   I wasn't willing to do that.
[00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:48.640]   So we got about 1%.
[00:48:48.640 --> 00:48:54.240]   It was enough for me to do one, not to have an employee or it was enough to do.
[00:48:54.240 --> 00:48:55.600]   There's another question.
[00:48:55.600 --> 00:49:00.360]   I think that there is a kind of membership structure that could work for you.
[00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:03.840]   If you're a security geek, you want to support Steve.
[00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:05.920]   You can pay for Steve.
[00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:06.920]   And you should try that.
[00:49:06.920 --> 00:49:09.000]   You're not paying for Steve's content.
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:11.200]   You are paying to support Steve's good work.
[00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:12.920]   You're paying for him to be there.
[00:49:12.920 --> 00:49:14.600]   And again, you have to rethink.
[00:49:14.600 --> 00:49:17.840]   So 80,000 people listen to that show for free.
[00:49:17.840 --> 00:49:18.840]   Right.
[00:49:18.840 --> 00:49:20.840]   So that's a tribe.
[00:49:20.840 --> 00:49:21.840]   That's a, that's a, that's a, that's a, that's a, that's a, that's a, that's a, that's a,
[00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:23.000]   it's probably go down to 10,000.
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:24.000]   How much should I charge?
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   Five bucks a month.
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:26.000]   They're no charge.
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   Oh, you don't charge.
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:28.000]   You don't charge patronage.
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:31.200]   So the next questions are how long to give him value.
[00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:32.200]   Right.
[00:49:32.200 --> 00:49:33.200]   Right.
[00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:35.080]   And what privileges of membership do they get?
[00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:38.000]   At some level, you know, there's a book called The Curve.
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:39.880]   This is exactly Kevin's point a minute ago.
[00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:41.160]   There's a variable value here.
[00:49:41.160 --> 00:49:42.800]   We treat everybody media all the same.
[00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:45.960]   When you go to the variable value, the author of The Curve, I didn't read it.
[00:49:45.960 --> 00:49:49.120]   I just listened to his lecture online for free.
[00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:53.640]   But he said, you need a long tail to convert a certain number to pay a certain amount,
[00:49:53.640 --> 00:49:57.920]   but you, you then can convert some number of schmucks to pay a thousand dollars for
[00:49:57.920 --> 00:50:00.920]   fake hate to feed to fake cows.
[00:50:00.920 --> 00:50:03.960]   There are people out there and, and, and Amanda Palmer, if you haven't, we've, I think you
[00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:08.560]   all watched Amanda Palmer's amazing TED talk about, about this.
[00:50:08.560 --> 00:50:13.440]   There are people who would pay a thousand dollars to support Steve, who would, who would
[00:50:13.440 --> 00:50:17.160]   go to an event with Steve and pay for that privilege to be with Steve, or to be able
[00:50:17.160 --> 00:50:21.240]   to get a little bit consulting from Steve at a certain rate.
[00:50:21.240 --> 00:50:25.160]   There is a variable value that you could capture less so for a show like this, because, you
[00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:26.880]   know, Jarvis Plathers screw it.
[00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:27.880]   Not even more than that.
[00:50:27.880 --> 00:50:32.800]   Free is expensive, but Steve has incredible value to people.
[00:50:32.800 --> 00:50:33.840]   People want to support his work.
[00:50:33.840 --> 00:50:36.240]   They believe his work is important in the entire ecosystem.
[00:50:36.240 --> 00:50:37.240]   Yeah.
[00:50:37.240 --> 00:50:41.680]   They have the Steve Club, but it's not about charging for access to the show.
[00:50:41.680 --> 00:50:45.600]   Instead, it's about giving people, have you watched the Amanda Palmer TED talk?
[00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:46.600]   Oh, yeah.
[00:50:46.600 --> 00:50:47.600]   Yeah.
[00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:51.520]   It's about giving people the opportunity to be generous to you.
[00:50:51.520 --> 00:50:52.520]   And right now they don't have the opportunity.
[00:50:52.520 --> 00:50:54.840]   They have, they have a give button or they listen to the ads.
[00:50:54.840 --> 00:50:55.840]   That's really all you have.
[00:50:55.840 --> 00:51:00.160]   If you think through a membership strategy more, it goes around different ways to contribute
[00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:02.920]   and different ways to get rewards, social status.
[00:51:02.920 --> 00:51:05.840]   If Steve mentions, you know, here's my 10 biggest patrons.
[00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:06.840]   Thank you very much.
[00:51:06.840 --> 00:51:08.160]   They'll, they'll, they'll, they'll fail.
[00:51:08.160 --> 00:51:10.520]   What happened is that Steve has done this.
[00:51:10.520 --> 00:51:11.200]   >>Yeah.
[00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:12.360]   >>We're going to take a break.
[00:51:12.360 --> 00:51:14.580]   When we come back a new Google project you're going to be
[00:51:14.580 --> 00:51:20.220]   excited about Jeff called project or, but first a word from our sponsors.
[00:51:20.220 --> 00:51:27.640]   All those words you love to hear, but first a word from our sponsor is actually Samsung,
[00:51:27.640 --> 00:51:32.160]   Smart Things is a sponsor that started with crowd sourcing.
[00:51:32.160 --> 00:51:35.760]   The Smart Things Hub was originally a Kickstarter project.
[00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:38.920]   And they were, and they did great because they were trying to solve a problem.
[00:51:38.920 --> 00:51:44.440]   Anybody who's tried to solve the home automation conundrum wants to solve, which is how do
[00:51:44.440 --> 00:51:49.040]   you get a bunch of different things using different protocols, different apps on the
[00:51:49.040 --> 00:51:52.480]   smartphone to talk to one another to work together?
[00:51:52.480 --> 00:51:54.040]   How do you simplify that?
[00:51:54.040 --> 00:51:55.880]   The Smart Things Hub, that's how.
[00:51:55.880 --> 00:51:59.600]   The Smart Things Hub talks to everything, hundreds of devices, including Smart Things
[00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:06.120]   own devices allows you to use a single app on your iPhone, your Android phone or your
[00:52:06.120 --> 00:52:12.000]   Windows phone for monitoring, for security, for lighting, for entertainment.
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:18.880]   One app does it all and can combine actions from a variety of unrelated devices.
[00:52:18.880 --> 00:52:20.600]   So everything works together.
[00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:21.840]   I really like that.
[00:52:21.840 --> 00:52:23.800]   The new Smart Things Hub just came out.
[00:52:23.800 --> 00:52:25.560]   I think you're going to like it.
[00:52:25.560 --> 00:52:31.600]   light bulbs, everything, even your appliances can be controlled from the smart things,
[00:52:31.600 --> 00:52:36.400]   Samsung smart things hub, different actions when you're asleep, awake, when you arrive
[00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:41.100]   home, when you leave home, get, you know, get an alert on your smartphone if water is
[00:52:41.100 --> 00:52:43.240]   detected where it doesn't belong.
[00:52:43.240 --> 00:52:46.520]   No contracts, no monthly fees and installation is a snap.
[00:52:46.520 --> 00:52:48.980]   There's nothing to do but plug it in.
[00:52:48.980 --> 00:52:53.540]   Smart things, it's the easiest way to protect your home.
[00:52:53.540 --> 00:52:57.860]   And we're going to get you a deal on any of the featured smart things kit.

[00:53:02.780 --> 00:53:06.100]   You're basically just getting the hub in a few devices, the starting point, but you
[00:53:06.100 --> 00:53:08.460]   can add all sorts of devices.
[00:53:08.460 --> 00:53:12.840]   One hub can handle, I don't know what the limit is, but hundreds of different devices.

[00:53:35.660 --> 00:53:39.660]   I, G, we're so glad to have their support for our show.
[00:53:39.660 --> 00:53:42.140]   And that is one thing that does happen is you have a real, I don't think that's such
[00:53:42.140 --> 00:53:47.060]   a bad thing is you have a relationship with these companies to support the show.
[00:53:47.060 --> 00:53:52.740]   We were at, last week, the reason I was in New York, Jeff, was for the IAB, the Interactive
[00:53:52.740 --> 00:53:57.860]   Advertising Bureau's first podcast up front.
[00:53:57.860 --> 00:53:59.140]   And that was very interesting.
[00:53:59.140 --> 00:54:01.100]   You know about the regular network up front.
[00:54:01.100 --> 00:54:02.820]   Yeah, I wish I'd been there to go to it.
[00:54:02.820 --> 00:54:06.140]   I'm sure you've gone to a few when you were a TV critic.
[00:54:06.140 --> 00:54:07.140]   Oh, yeah.
[00:54:07.140 --> 00:54:08.140]   Yeah.
[00:54:08.140 --> 00:54:10.780]   So they'd bring in all the stars and they'd show the new shows and then they'd say the
[00:54:10.780 --> 00:54:14.660]   advertisers, would you like to buy this brand new show for the next, for the upcoming
[00:54:14.660 --> 00:54:15.660]   year?
[00:54:15.660 --> 00:54:19.700]   That's not exactly how the podcast up front's worked.
[00:54:19.700 --> 00:54:22.700]   None of the podcast stars were there.
[00:54:22.700 --> 00:54:23.700]   There weren't that many.
[00:54:23.700 --> 00:54:24.700]   You were there.
[00:54:24.700 --> 00:54:28.140]   Well, I was there, but I, you know, I've been, I don't know if I'm a podcast star, but I
[00:54:28.140 --> 00:54:34.660]   am very committed to the medium that so I was, I wanted to support it.
[00:54:34.660 --> 00:54:38.740]   And there were, there were some big advertisers, some big agencies.
[00:54:38.740 --> 00:54:43.660]   But you know, podcasts don't sell a year's worth of, we don't announce the new season.
[00:54:43.660 --> 00:54:44.660]   There's no season.
[00:54:44.660 --> 00:54:45.660]   There really is season at TV.
[00:54:45.660 --> 00:54:46.940]   I'm sure it's about a scarcity.
[00:54:46.940 --> 00:54:49.660]   You want to beat somebody else to it and get the price before it becomes big.
[00:54:49.660 --> 00:54:53.300]   And so you're, you're, you're, it's like, it's like an airline buying gas when the price
[00:54:53.300 --> 00:54:54.300]   is down.
[00:54:54.300 --> 00:54:58.380]   Well, the, so the star of the show, of course, is cereal.
[00:54:58.380 --> 00:55:06.020]   Sir Koenig was not there, of course, nor was the guy in prison, but I was stunned.
[00:55:06.020 --> 00:55:12.980]   Cereal has set a new bar for podcast listenership, 12 episodes, a hundred million downloads.
[00:55:12.980 --> 00:55:15.300]   And that's counted by Podtracker that does our metrics.
[00:55:15.300 --> 00:55:17.660]   And I know Podtracker's very conservative.
[00:55:17.660 --> 00:55:21.940]   If they say a hundred million, it's, it's at least a hundred million uniques.
[00:55:21.940 --> 00:55:22.940]   That's pretty amazing.
[00:55:22.940 --> 00:55:25.340]   The gimnet guys were at ExoXo as well.
[00:55:25.340 --> 00:55:26.340]   Yes.
[00:55:26.340 --> 00:55:29.180]   And they were, you know, talking about this, something's in there, they were basically
[00:55:29.180 --> 00:55:31.540]   saying we have very, very good ad rates.
[00:55:31.540 --> 00:55:34.420]   This is good, but it makes us a little nervous because I'm not sure that's going to last.
[00:55:34.420 --> 00:55:35.420]   Right.
[00:55:35.420 --> 00:55:36.420]   They want to keep doing what they do.
[00:55:36.420 --> 00:55:37.420]   Well, we're all nervous.
[00:55:37.420 --> 00:55:39.460]   And they, and you know, they've made some very successful podcasts there.
[00:55:39.460 --> 00:55:40.460]   Sure have.
[00:55:40.460 --> 00:55:41.460]   Sure have.
[00:55:41.460 --> 00:55:46.100]   Between startup and startup is the podcast about starting gimlin.
[00:55:46.100 --> 00:55:47.860]   Anyway, it was fun.
[00:55:47.860 --> 00:55:48.860]   It was good.
[00:55:48.860 --> 00:55:52.540]   And, you know, but there's still some spec, some nervous.
[00:55:52.540 --> 00:55:53.540]   You're selling it.
[00:55:53.540 --> 00:55:54.740]   Lisa selling the ads.
[00:55:54.740 --> 00:55:55.740]   We sell ads.
[00:55:55.740 --> 00:55:57.540]   We have several brokers that sell ads including Podtracker.
[00:55:57.540 --> 00:55:59.060]   Was it worthwhile for business to go there?
[00:55:59.060 --> 00:56:00.060]   Oh, it wasn't for us.
[00:56:00.060 --> 00:56:01.660]   We were there as guests of Podtracker.
[00:56:01.660 --> 00:56:07.300]   So Lisa had the, was very polite and did not pitch any of the advertisers there.
[00:56:07.300 --> 00:56:09.700]   Well, or Lisa.
[00:56:09.700 --> 00:56:10.700]   She was.
[00:56:10.700 --> 00:56:13.620]   She was very polite.
[00:56:13.620 --> 00:56:15.860]   But you know, it's a, that was a big deal.
[00:56:15.860 --> 00:56:17.500]   And I was glad to go there to kind of support it.
[00:56:17.500 --> 00:56:21.420]   One of the things I told people is that when you, we, I said, hey, we turned down a lot
[00:56:21.420 --> 00:56:25.180]   of advertisers because what we're doing is, and you should understand this.
[00:56:25.180 --> 00:56:30.900]   The reason podcast ads work is we're introducing our community, our precious community to,
[00:56:30.900 --> 00:56:31.900]   to an advertiser.
[00:56:31.900 --> 00:56:36.060]   Talk about that for a second because I think, I think that's critical to that you've, that's
[00:56:36.060 --> 00:56:38.980]   the scarcity we have to create in advertising.
[00:56:38.980 --> 00:56:43.140]   This is the idea that says that there is a, there is, if advertisers want to be next to
[00:56:43.140 --> 00:56:48.180]   you, you create the flow, which is native like, oh, like old radio number one, number two,
[00:56:48.180 --> 00:56:51.220]   you create relevance because you only think things are going to be relevant to us as an
[00:56:51.220 --> 00:56:52.220]   audience.
[00:56:52.220 --> 00:56:55.580]   But number three, the thing that you don't talk about much is this idea of something passing
[00:56:55.580 --> 00:56:59.580]   to your standards and not anybody can buy on to it.
[00:56:59.580 --> 00:57:05.340]   In fact, there was an audible gasp when I said, we turned down advertisers every day.
[00:57:05.340 --> 00:57:08.940]   There was like, and at first I thought, Oh God, have I made some horrible blunder?
[00:57:08.940 --> 00:57:12.700]   But everybody said, no, it's okay.
[00:57:12.700 --> 00:57:14.940]   But they were shocked because that's not how it works.
[00:57:14.940 --> 00:57:17.100]   Nobody turns turns away money.
[00:57:17.100 --> 00:57:18.100]   So you're protecting.
[00:57:18.100 --> 00:57:19.420]   So, so nobody resent.
[00:57:19.420 --> 00:57:22.020]   I don't think people resent the ads you have on these shows.
[00:57:22.020 --> 00:57:23.860]   We recognize what it isn't because you do that.
[00:57:23.860 --> 00:57:24.860]   Give us some examples.
[00:57:24.860 --> 00:57:28.260]   I don't mean specific companies, but the kinds of things you turned out.
[00:57:28.260 --> 00:57:31.980]   Well, when we get inquiries from, well, you know, sometimes I would turn down advertisers
[00:57:31.980 --> 00:57:35.140]   because I to protect them, they want to spend money.
[00:57:35.140 --> 00:57:37.740]   And one of the first things I say is, you know what, we're not going to do any, we're
[00:57:37.740 --> 00:57:41.260]   not going to work for you because for a variety of reasons.
[00:57:41.260 --> 00:57:43.740]   I'll turn down a product that I don't like.
[00:57:43.740 --> 00:57:46.980]   You know, we lately a lot of antivirus companies want to advertise.
[00:57:46.980 --> 00:57:50.580]   Well, we don't have any antivirus companies advertising because it's my opinion.
[00:57:50.580 --> 00:57:53.100]   You no longer need an antivirus.
[00:57:53.100 --> 00:57:56.100]   So that's the kinds of things.
[00:57:56.100 --> 00:58:02.580]   Sometimes companies, it's, you know, once you don't have the conversation before the
[00:58:02.580 --> 00:58:07.020]   buy about what they want to tell the audience, I wish you could.
[00:58:07.020 --> 00:58:11.060]   Yeah, because sometimes after a company makes a buy, they say, now we want to say this.
[00:58:11.060 --> 00:58:13.300]   And then I have to go back to push back and say you're not.
[00:58:13.300 --> 00:58:14.500]   What do you do with an RFP?
[00:58:14.500 --> 00:58:17.020]   Like no, we don't do an RFP.
[00:58:17.020 --> 00:58:20.260]   But like doos does where she says, no, I'm not going to do that.
[00:58:20.260 --> 00:58:24.540]   But we try to pick advertisers that would understand that before, you know, upfront,
[00:58:24.540 --> 00:58:28.100]   like you get this, this is not, we're not going to lie to the audience.
[00:58:28.100 --> 00:58:29.980]   We're not going to misrepresent your product.
[00:58:29.980 --> 00:58:33.460]   We're not going to tell them I need exists where it doesn't.
[00:58:33.460 --> 00:58:37.540]   And so, yeah, we're pretty careful about who we pick.
[00:58:37.540 --> 00:58:41.420]   And I thought what that was the message actually, the main reason I went to New York is to tell
[00:58:41.420 --> 00:58:46.540]   these big agencies and advertisers that your idea of what advertising is has to change
[00:58:46.540 --> 00:58:48.860]   in the new world because so talk about that.
[00:58:48.860 --> 00:58:52.780]   You have to treat your the audience with respect.
[00:58:52.780 --> 00:58:57.860]   And I have and one of the whole reason for ad blockers is a lack of respect for people's
[00:58:57.860 --> 00:59:00.180]   bandwidth, time and attention.
[00:59:00.180 --> 00:59:02.340]   You know, and so it.
[00:59:02.340 --> 00:59:04.060]   We say you're coming to our audience.
[00:59:04.060 --> 00:59:09.340]   We want you to come as a peer, talk about features and benefits hat in hand saying, would you
[00:59:09.340 --> 00:59:10.340]   like to buy our product?
[00:59:10.340 --> 00:59:12.380]   Here's what it does.
[00:59:12.380 --> 00:59:16.500]   And we protect, I'm protective of the community because that's our only, that's our real asset.
[00:59:16.500 --> 00:59:17.980]   And that's all I care about.
[00:59:17.980 --> 00:59:20.260]   That's why we do it in the first place.
[00:59:20.260 --> 00:59:25.220]   And so the advertiser we do because we need to pay for all this fancy equipment.
[00:59:25.220 --> 00:59:31.420]   But so it's a, it's a beneficial relationship as long as the advertiser understands that
[00:59:31.420 --> 00:59:36.020]   they have to respect the community as much as we do.
[00:59:36.020 --> 00:59:38.580]   It doesn't always, you know, it doesn't always work.
[00:59:38.580 --> 00:59:42.860]   A lot of people are very offended when I say, like, you can't buy ads.
[00:59:42.860 --> 00:59:43.860]   Like what's wrong with us?
[00:59:43.860 --> 00:59:48.420]   And we, we try not to say, well, I just think your company sucks.
[00:59:48.420 --> 00:59:51.020]   Do you lose agencies that represent those clients?
[00:59:51.020 --> 00:59:52.020]   Oh, yeah.
[00:59:52.020 --> 00:59:53.020]   Oh, yeah.
[00:59:53.020 --> 00:59:54.460]   Sometimes we'll turn down a, we'll turn away agencies.
[00:59:54.460 --> 00:59:56.820]   A lot of advertisers go through agencies still.
[00:59:56.820 --> 01:00:00.500]   That's a big problem with podcasting because agencies want to spend millions.
[01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:01.500]   They make money.
[01:00:01.500 --> 01:00:04.380]   They make money on commission.
[01:00:04.380 --> 01:00:06.380]   So they get a percentage of the amount of ads they place.
[01:00:06.380 --> 01:00:08.780]   They won't one stop shopping at big audience.
[01:00:08.780 --> 01:00:12.940]   So they would much prefer to buy the Super Bowl than a podcast.
[01:00:12.940 --> 01:00:17.300]   Even though a Super Bowl ad at millions of dollars, probably, you know, you spend too
[01:00:17.300 --> 01:00:21.780]   million dollars in Super Bowl ad, you could buy a podcast for the next 10 years.
[01:00:21.780 --> 01:00:24.740]   But Lisa says, stop talking.
[01:00:24.740 --> 01:00:26.180]   I would say anything bad.
[01:00:26.180 --> 01:00:34.620]   So, but an agency prefers to buy a big thing like that, right?
[01:00:34.620 --> 01:00:38.780]   Because an agency gets a commission and it's a lot easier to get a commission.
[01:00:38.780 --> 01:00:43.420]   Speaking of a moral hazard, well, the agency is not motivated to save you money and you're
[01:00:43.420 --> 01:00:45.820]   by the agency is gets a cut up with solders.
[01:00:45.820 --> 01:00:47.820]   The agency is motivated to make you spend more.
[01:00:47.820 --> 01:00:51.580]   Yeah, there's that, that occurs in a lot of places in the world, doesn't it?
[01:00:51.580 --> 01:00:56.220]   The doctor who prescribes you medicines that you don't really need the, you know, I mean,
[01:00:56.220 --> 01:00:58.220]   I can go on and on and on on that one.
[01:00:58.220 --> 01:01:00.500]   Now, this is what Lisa tells you to shut up.
[01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:01.700]   Yes, she's saying shut up.
[01:01:01.700 --> 01:01:06.180]   Pretty much saying this for the last 10 minutes.
[01:01:06.180 --> 01:01:07.180]   I don't mind.
[01:01:07.180 --> 01:01:08.580]   I think I like to be transparent.
[01:01:08.580 --> 01:01:09.580]   I think that's part of the deal.
[01:01:09.580 --> 01:01:13.660]   I think it's part of the value that you bring is this and that people can't be here unless
[01:01:13.660 --> 01:01:16.660]   you you that's the scarcity trust is the scarcity.
[01:01:16.660 --> 01:01:18.660]   Now, tux says you only choose us based steps.
[01:01:18.660 --> 01:01:20.340]   I don't choose the advertisers.
[01:01:20.340 --> 01:01:23.620]   I don't think that we're choosing the advertisers.
[01:01:23.620 --> 01:01:28.620]   We try to we go out and sell, but we do turn away advertisers.
[01:01:28.620 --> 01:01:33.620]   And if we can't get, we have mostly us based advertisers or many us based advertisers,
[01:01:33.620 --> 01:01:37.020]   but that's where you a space, us based company.
[01:01:37.020 --> 01:01:39.460]   That's kind of just the way it kind of is.
[01:01:39.460 --> 01:01:40.460]   I would love to have it.
[01:01:40.460 --> 01:01:41.460]   Or national.
[01:01:41.460 --> 01:01:42.460]   That's hard to do.
[01:01:42.460 --> 01:01:46.740]   You know, that's another case of where it's just there's never been a market for that.
[01:01:46.740 --> 01:01:48.940]   And Ford buys an ad on NBC.
[01:01:48.940 --> 01:01:51.620]   They don't care if people see it in Germany.
[01:01:51.620 --> 01:01:54.420]   They're going to have to start, aren't they?
[01:01:54.420 --> 01:01:58.620]   But they certainly don't pay for it at this point, right?
[01:01:58.620 --> 01:02:01.340]   Project Aura Google has high.
[01:02:01.340 --> 01:02:05.620]   You know, those guys who were working at Amazon doing the fire phone and then Amazon
[01:02:05.620 --> 01:02:08.900]   went never mind first they cancel the fire phone.
[01:02:08.900 --> 01:02:14.060]   Then they filed a lab to 126, which I'm told were very smart people.
[01:02:14.060 --> 01:02:23.740]   They're now working for Google project Aura, a you are a it apparently just started in
[01:02:23.740 --> 01:02:24.740]   June.
[01:02:24.740 --> 01:02:28.940]   It's focused on reviving your favorite Jeff Google glass.
[01:02:28.940 --> 01:02:35.340]   Yeah, Google glass at least three employees, according to business designer from lab 126
[01:02:35.340 --> 01:02:36.980]   work in the new group.
[01:02:36.980 --> 01:02:42.260]   And they have a dedicated recruiter doing more hiring.
[01:02:42.260 --> 01:02:45.500]   It would be the next generation.
[01:02:45.500 --> 01:02:47.460]   Something simpler that does one function.
[01:02:47.460 --> 01:02:48.460]   Yeah.
[01:02:48.460 --> 01:02:53.380]   I feel like wearables are I still believe in wearables, but I've yet to see one that I
[01:02:53.380 --> 01:02:57.300]   really like.
[01:02:57.300 --> 01:03:00.300]   So Howard Stern is going to do he refuses to wear the Apple watch because he doesn't
[01:03:00.300 --> 01:03:03.620]   want to try to thing on his wrist all day on his body.
[01:03:03.620 --> 01:03:04.620]   Is he afraid of it?
[01:03:04.620 --> 01:03:05.620]   Make him cancer?
[01:03:05.620 --> 01:03:06.620]   Yeah.
[01:03:06.620 --> 01:03:09.340]   So who we ever heard of risk cancer?
[01:03:09.340 --> 01:03:17.060]   I don't want to make far as I know the real danger was when we had radium on the dials
[01:03:17.060 --> 01:03:21.660]   and the women who had the lick the brushes to apply radium to the glowing watch faces.
[01:03:21.660 --> 01:03:23.420]   They didn't do so well.
[01:03:23.420 --> 01:03:28.660]   But I don't you know, I think that the dangers of electronics next to your body are a little
[01:03:28.660 --> 01:03:29.660]   overblown.
[01:03:29.660 --> 01:03:30.660]   I don't know.
[01:03:30.660 --> 01:03:33.500]   I'm not a doctor.
[01:03:33.500 --> 01:03:35.060]   Okay.
[01:03:35.060 --> 01:03:41.020]   Howard Stern's a little bit of a weirdo.
[01:03:41.020 --> 01:03:42.620]   He's not how he.
[01:03:42.620 --> 01:03:45.220]   It's not a dull weird.
[01:03:45.220 --> 01:03:49.860]   How he yeah, and dull weird, but he's you know, he could I could see I could see Howard
[01:03:49.860 --> 01:03:52.420]   wearing rubber gloves and fist bumping people.
[01:03:52.420 --> 01:03:53.420]   Yeah.
[01:03:53.420 --> 01:03:57.020]   Well, Robin and Howard Robin, if I last week about who's more insane.
[01:03:57.020 --> 01:03:58.180]   Yeah.
[01:03:58.180 --> 01:03:59.180]   I think Howard.
[01:03:59.180 --> 01:04:01.180]   That's what I don't know.
[01:04:01.180 --> 01:04:05.780]   I think Robin's gone and had ayahuasca and the sudden duod cults and things.
[01:04:05.780 --> 01:04:06.780]   Okay.
[01:04:06.780 --> 01:04:07.780]   Now she's freezing herself.
[01:04:07.780 --> 01:04:09.780]   She's in that that hyper cold thing.
[01:04:09.780 --> 01:04:11.580]   Was she doing that?
[01:04:11.580 --> 01:04:12.580]   Yeah.
[01:04:12.580 --> 01:04:13.580]   Whatever.
[01:04:13.580 --> 01:04:17.380]   But when she dies or just generally.
[01:04:17.380 --> 01:04:18.380]   Yeah.
[01:04:18.380 --> 01:04:19.380]   No, no, no.
[01:04:19.380 --> 01:04:22.580]   As a as a live person, this is the new thing.
[01:04:22.580 --> 01:04:23.580]   You know, it's you know what?
[01:04:23.580 --> 01:04:25.140]   You're in you're in air.
[01:04:25.140 --> 01:04:27.020]   You're not immersed in this stuff.
[01:04:27.020 --> 01:04:28.020]   Right.
[01:04:28.020 --> 01:04:33.300]   I thought you were getting a tub at 165 below, but no, you're just in a it's just chilly.
[01:04:33.300 --> 01:04:36.700]   Just in a slightly colder room.
[01:04:36.700 --> 01:04:37.700]   Okay.
[01:04:37.700 --> 01:04:41.260]   It's just chilly because air doesn't conduct as you know, air does not conduct all that
[01:04:41.260 --> 01:04:42.260]   well.
[01:04:42.260 --> 01:04:45.620]   I wouldn't do it in water or some liquid.
[01:04:45.620 --> 01:04:48.780]   Actually, well, yeah, let's do it.
[01:04:48.780 --> 01:04:52.820]   Hey, burn you frostbite.
[01:04:52.820 --> 01:04:59.140]   Whatever happened to Google books, big article by Tim Wu in the New Yorker last week.
[01:04:59.140 --> 01:05:00.140]   I thought it was a good article.
[01:05:00.140 --> 01:05:01.140]   I thought it was a great.
[01:05:01.140 --> 01:05:02.140]   I liked Tim Wu.
[01:05:02.140 --> 01:05:05.180]   He's a who just went to the attorney general's office in the city of New York.
[01:05:05.180 --> 01:05:06.180]   Oh, really?
[01:05:06.180 --> 01:05:07.180]   Mm hmm.
[01:05:07.180 --> 01:05:09.420]   He was a professor at Columbia, right?
[01:05:09.420 --> 01:05:10.420]   Yes.
[01:05:10.420 --> 01:05:11.980]   What's he going to do with the attorney general's office?
[01:05:11.980 --> 01:05:13.260]   It was cyber stuff.
[01:05:13.260 --> 01:05:16.620]   So I know, you know, I liked him too, but Tim's been a little.
[01:05:16.620 --> 01:05:18.340]   It's weird retrograde in some ways.
[01:05:18.340 --> 01:05:19.620]   He wrote the kill switch.
[01:05:19.620 --> 01:05:21.340]   You're at the coz switch chance.
[01:05:21.340 --> 01:05:27.820]   And he writes for the New Yorker and he's talking about this project that is kind of
[01:05:27.820 --> 01:05:31.980]   sadly more abundant to digitize all the world's books.
[01:05:31.980 --> 01:05:37.900]   And of course, it's the author's guild and it's ill because it shut it down saying, hey,
[01:05:37.900 --> 01:05:39.620]   well, we want some royalties for those books.
[01:05:39.620 --> 01:05:43.260]   Nobody wants.
[01:05:43.260 --> 01:05:44.700]   How do you feel you're an author?
[01:05:44.700 --> 01:05:46.060]   How do you, where do you come down on this?
[01:05:46.060 --> 01:05:50.700]   I would guess that you're your pro Google books, but very pro Google books because I
[01:05:50.700 --> 01:05:53.500]   think that, you know, listen, I've written the group.
[01:05:53.500 --> 01:05:54.500]   I do still.
[01:05:54.500 --> 01:05:57.540]   People still do by what Google do, you know, I'll get an occasional thing.
[01:05:57.540 --> 01:06:00.500]   But at some point, let it be found.
[01:06:00.500 --> 01:06:04.540]   And the problem with this is that the promise of Google books was all these outer print
[01:06:04.540 --> 01:06:10.020]   things that you can't get even in a strand bookstore shelf suddenly could be exposed
[01:06:10.020 --> 01:06:11.740]   to the air again and people could read it again.
[01:06:11.740 --> 01:06:14.420]   But nope, that stopped.
[01:06:14.420 --> 01:06:18.540]   And I think that it was copyright fundamentalism to some extent.
[01:06:18.540 --> 01:06:23.740]   Yeah, like Ursula K. Le Guin, who said the deal that the publishers did with Google was
[01:06:23.740 --> 01:06:26.740]   a deal with the devil.
[01:06:26.740 --> 01:06:32.500]   Well, it's difficult because anything you say about it applies in the same way to libraries
[01:06:32.500 --> 01:06:33.500]   as well.
[01:06:33.500 --> 01:06:35.300]   So it's very hard to work out what the model is.
[01:06:35.300 --> 01:06:36.660]   Larry Lessig had a great solution.
[01:06:36.660 --> 01:06:38.140]   He said it's very simple.
[01:06:38.140 --> 01:06:43.660]   When a copyright is about to expire, you publish it and you say it and you can renew
[01:06:43.660 --> 01:06:45.900]   it for $1.
[01:06:45.900 --> 01:06:49.980]   And if there's anybody willing to pay, if any authors want to pay a dollar to retain their
[01:06:49.980 --> 01:06:52.260]   copyright, then you renew it.
[01:06:52.260 --> 01:06:54.460]   Otherwise it goes into the public domain and Google is scanning.
[01:06:54.460 --> 01:06:55.460]   Yeah, well, that works.
[01:06:55.460 --> 01:06:57.540]   It also works if you reduce the copyright term back to a sensible amount.
[01:06:57.540 --> 01:06:58.540]   Right.
[01:06:58.540 --> 01:07:01.900]   Because the problem is that the way copyright is the moment, but things never go out of
[01:07:01.900 --> 01:07:02.900]   the government.
[01:07:02.900 --> 01:07:05.340]   No, because we keep extending it so Mickey Mouse is never available.
[01:07:05.340 --> 01:07:06.340]   Right.
[01:07:06.340 --> 01:07:07.340]   And there's the public domain.
[01:07:07.340 --> 01:07:09.340]   So there's a challenge there.
[01:07:09.340 --> 01:07:14.260]   But the other half of this is how the libraries work.
[01:07:14.260 --> 01:07:17.220]   And the Internet Archive has done a bunch of work with this as well because they scan
[01:07:17.220 --> 01:07:18.700]   physical books too.
[01:07:18.700 --> 01:07:19.700]   And they're trying to work out.
[01:07:19.700 --> 01:07:20.700]   Okay.
[01:07:20.700 --> 01:07:23.340]   The Bruce D. Cales has just damned the copyright law in full speed ahead.
[01:07:23.340 --> 01:07:24.340]   No, no, he doesn't.
[01:07:24.340 --> 01:07:27.460]   No, no, he's trying to work out how to be an actual library because that's what he cares
[01:07:27.460 --> 01:07:28.460]   about being.
[01:07:28.460 --> 01:07:29.460]   He wants to preserve things.
[01:07:29.460 --> 01:07:33.580]   So we're going to go to the library versus Google Books.
[01:07:33.580 --> 01:07:36.060]   That's, well, you can check out books from the library.
[01:07:36.060 --> 01:07:37.500]   We have to check them back in again.
[01:07:37.500 --> 01:07:39.100]   So there's a certain weirdness about that.
[01:07:39.100 --> 01:07:40.860]   So there's a notion they've only got one copy of the book.
[01:07:40.860 --> 01:07:43.260]   They've tried to do that with audiobooks and things that are digital.
[01:07:43.260 --> 01:07:45.260]   It's just very strange.
[01:07:45.260 --> 01:07:49.500]   And it ends up being, it does end up being sort of completely odd.
[01:07:49.500 --> 01:07:50.500]   Yes.
[01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:57.500]   You check out a digital copy of a book and then you have to bring it back after two weeks.
[01:07:57.500 --> 01:07:58.500]   Yes.
[01:07:58.500 --> 01:08:00.900]   It's like, hmm.
[01:08:00.900 --> 01:08:13.060]   So they did make a deal in 2008, but apparently, let's see, four years ago, a federal judge
[01:08:13.060 --> 01:08:15.260]   through out the deal.
[01:08:15.260 --> 01:08:16.260]   Right.
[01:08:16.260 --> 01:08:22.860]   And the same, the copyright issue should be decided by, oh, this will be, this will work.
[01:08:22.860 --> 01:08:23.860]   Congress.
[01:08:23.860 --> 01:08:24.860]   Oh, yeah.
[01:08:24.860 --> 01:08:27.660]   Oh, that'll work.
[01:08:27.660 --> 01:08:32.180]   Of course, leaving things to Congress, Tim writes has become a synonym for doing nothing
[01:08:32.180 --> 01:08:35.260]   and predictably a full seven years after that court decision.
[01:08:35.260 --> 01:08:36.460]   We're still waiting.
[01:08:36.460 --> 01:08:40.260]   Meanwhile, Google stopped, I presume, has stopped scanning.
[01:08:40.260 --> 01:08:43.660]   I don't know, it depends on what they're scanning.
[01:08:43.660 --> 01:08:44.660]   I don't know.
[01:08:44.660 --> 01:08:46.660]   Maybe they should just keep scanning it.
[01:08:46.660 --> 01:08:49.660]   I mean, it's at some level for them, it's data.
[01:08:49.660 --> 01:08:50.660]   Yeah.
[01:08:50.660 --> 01:08:51.740]   And they love data.
[01:08:51.740 --> 01:08:55.220]   Their idea was to make, what does it make the world's information available to everybody?
[01:08:55.220 --> 01:08:56.620]   Available in searchable.
[01:08:56.620 --> 01:08:58.620]   Organize and accessible.
[01:08:58.620 --> 01:09:04.280]   And that's exactly what this is, especially books that are obscure, out of print, not
[01:09:04.280 --> 01:09:07.140]   out of copyright, thanks to our ridiculous copyright law.
[01:09:07.140 --> 01:09:08.140]   Yes.
[01:09:08.140 --> 01:09:13.340]   All of societal interest, but not of any financial interest to any author.
[01:09:13.340 --> 01:09:14.740]   Right.
[01:09:14.740 --> 01:09:22.380]   Apparently, the authors Guild has proposed a solution called extended collective licensing
[01:09:22.380 --> 01:09:27.460]   that would allow the owners of scanned out of print libraries like Google or actual nonprofits
[01:09:27.460 --> 01:09:30.940]   to make a limited set of them available with payouts.
[01:09:30.940 --> 01:09:34.220]   The US copyright offers, supports this plan.
[01:09:34.220 --> 01:09:37.660]   This sounds a little bit like what this kind of weird hybrid thing that libraries are doing
[01:09:37.660 --> 01:09:39.460]   today.
[01:09:39.460 --> 01:09:44.140]   Tim says, "I suggest something simpler, the big bang license.
[01:09:44.140 --> 01:09:48.180]   Congress should allow anyone with a scanned library like Google to pay a price, say $125
[01:09:48.180 --> 01:09:53.380]   million to gain a license subject to any opt-outs, allowing them to make those scan prints available
[01:09:53.380 --> 01:09:55.980]   to institutional or individual subscribers.
[01:09:55.980 --> 01:10:00.020]   That money would be divided equally among all rights holders who come forward to claim
[01:10:00.020 --> 01:10:05.020]   it in a three-year window, split 50/50 between authors and publishers."
[01:10:05.020 --> 01:10:06.020]   Yeah.
[01:10:06.020 --> 01:10:08.260]   Why would Google do that?
[01:10:08.260 --> 01:10:09.980]   That's basically saying...
[01:10:09.980 --> 01:10:12.180]   Well, no, the point is that Google would...
[01:10:12.180 --> 01:10:13.780]   You'd have to get legislative backing for that.
[01:10:13.780 --> 01:10:18.740]   It would be a compulsory license like we have for a couple of versions of songs or something
[01:10:18.740 --> 01:10:20.700]   like that, after I asked you pass a law.
[01:10:20.700 --> 01:10:21.700]   So that is the challenge of that.
[01:10:21.700 --> 01:10:23.700]   Oh, it's going to pass a lot.
[01:10:23.700 --> 01:10:24.700]   No.
[01:10:24.700 --> 01:10:26.980]   We do have some good news about the dancing.
[01:10:26.980 --> 01:10:28.140]   President Lessig, maybe.
[01:10:28.140 --> 01:10:29.140]   Lessig.
[01:10:29.140 --> 01:10:30.140]   Lessig.
[01:10:30.140 --> 01:10:35.100]   You know, I think maybe the fact that all of these candidates are just eating themselves
[01:10:35.100 --> 01:10:37.460]   alive might maybe just one...
[01:10:37.460 --> 01:10:45.060]   Maybe it's like some sort of an ealing process where all of this junk gets burnt off and then
[01:10:45.060 --> 01:10:46.980]   all that's left is Larry.
[01:10:46.980 --> 01:10:49.060]   And he becomes president.
[01:10:49.060 --> 01:10:50.060]   And then he quits.
[01:10:50.060 --> 01:10:51.060]   And then he quits.
[01:10:51.060 --> 01:10:52.300]   He has a very good...
[01:10:52.300 --> 01:10:53.300]   That was his plan.
[01:10:53.300 --> 01:10:55.620]   I'm going to have a really good vice president.
[01:10:55.620 --> 01:10:58.180]   That was actually the Howard Stern plan for governor.
[01:10:58.180 --> 01:10:59.100]   Really?
[01:10:59.100 --> 01:11:00.100]   When?
[01:11:00.100 --> 01:11:09.360]   In the Dancing Baby case, which was a sad case, a 2007 YouTube video of a toddler dancing
[01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:13.220]   happened to be a Prince song playing in the background.
[01:11:13.220 --> 01:11:16.380]   Prince suede.
[01:11:16.380 --> 01:11:20.300]   It's all the way up to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals now.
[01:11:20.300 --> 01:11:21.300]   And actually, it doesn't...
[01:11:21.300 --> 01:11:23.780]   This isn't really about that Dancing Baby video.
[01:11:23.780 --> 01:11:26.100]   The kid, by the way, is now like 10.
[01:11:26.100 --> 01:11:30.100]   I wanted to see if there was some follow up to the kid.
[01:11:30.100 --> 01:11:33.300]   This kid should have gone to the Supreme Court just for the fun of it.
[01:11:33.300 --> 01:11:35.860]   I agree.
[01:11:35.860 --> 01:11:39.980]   But more importantly, the justices ruled, and we're going to talk about this on Saturday
[01:11:39.980 --> 01:11:46.540]   with Denise Howell, our tame lawyer on the new screensavers, the justices ruled this
[01:11:46.540 --> 01:11:48.380]   is the big thing.
[01:11:48.380 --> 01:11:57.580]   Copyright holders like Prince must consider the existence of fair use before sending a
[01:11:57.580 --> 01:11:58.580]   takedown.
[01:11:58.580 --> 01:11:59.580]   Yes.
[01:11:59.580 --> 01:12:00.580]   Wow.
[01:12:00.580 --> 01:12:02.180]   It's a good president.
[01:12:02.180 --> 01:12:06.460]   On the other hand, they also said, but automated programs could be part of this too, which is
[01:12:06.460 --> 01:12:09.940]   like, that's the big problem is that all of the very programs cannot distinguish fair
[01:12:09.940 --> 01:12:10.940]   use.
[01:12:10.940 --> 01:12:11.940]   Right.
[01:12:11.940 --> 01:12:15.660]   If we can't even get expensive lawyers to distinguish it without actually litigating,
[01:12:15.660 --> 01:12:17.580]   it's very hard for a program to do that.
[01:12:17.580 --> 01:12:19.620]   And that's that is part of the challenge of it.
[01:12:19.620 --> 01:12:23.820]   This is a huge change because all up to now, and I've always was told this, fair use was
[01:12:23.820 --> 01:12:24.820]   a defense.
[01:12:24.820 --> 01:12:30.060]   Well, as Larry Lastic has always said, fair use is the right to hire a lawyer.
[01:12:30.060 --> 01:12:31.060]   Yeah.
[01:12:31.060 --> 01:12:36.700]   So in other words, after you get sued, you can now use it as a defense in court at a
[01:12:36.700 --> 01:12:38.260]   great expense.
[01:12:38.260 --> 01:12:43.980]   But this court is now saying no, before the takedown, the copyright holder should consider
[01:12:43.980 --> 01:12:48.820]   in her head, is this a fair use of my copyright?
[01:12:48.820 --> 01:12:53.540]   And if that person, if that, if that copyright holder does not and goes after again and again
[01:12:53.540 --> 01:12:57.340]   and again, I presume that gives us some recourse that if they, if they take down twig shows,
[01:12:57.340 --> 01:13:02.460]   twit shows again and again and again, at some point you can maybe have some basis to say
[01:13:02.460 --> 01:13:05.380]   that they were negligent in their obligation to fair use.
[01:13:05.380 --> 01:13:09.260]   I think we've been whitelisted because we did for a long time get tagged on YouTube all
[01:13:09.260 --> 01:13:11.220]   the time.
[01:13:11.220 --> 01:13:13.460]   And to my knowledge, that's stopped, right?
[01:13:13.460 --> 01:13:14.460]   Not what?
[01:13:14.460 --> 01:13:16.860]   And of course, it was content ID.
[01:13:16.860 --> 01:13:18.860]   So it was automated, as you say.
[01:13:18.860 --> 01:13:24.180]   And so the point is that an automated system could be with some human intervention used
[01:13:24.180 --> 01:13:25.740]   in a way to protect fair use.
[01:13:25.740 --> 01:13:28.220]   You could say, no, no, that's a news organization.
[01:13:28.220 --> 01:13:33.380]   So when you try to do this with staff to review all these cases and at some point they just
[01:13:33.380 --> 01:13:34.380]   say it.
[01:13:34.380 --> 01:13:35.380]   And I'll whitelisted it.
[01:13:35.380 --> 01:13:36.380]   You know what?
[01:13:36.380 --> 01:13:38.620]   Twits going to do this all the time.
[01:13:38.620 --> 01:13:43.340]   We're going to complain all the time, but Twits is a news organization and traditionally
[01:13:43.340 --> 01:13:48.060]   news organizations are allowed to use small bits of copyrighted material as part of a news
[01:13:48.060 --> 01:13:50.060]   story.
[01:13:50.060 --> 01:13:54.260]   Anyway, we'll watch and see and we'll talk more about this with Denise.
[01:13:54.260 --> 01:13:56.420]   She is she's an attorney.
[01:13:56.420 --> 01:14:00.140]   And the Sir is Young's article at Mother Jones was a good summary of it.
[01:14:00.140 --> 01:14:01.140]   Good.
[01:14:01.140 --> 01:14:02.060]   I will put that up.
[01:14:02.060 --> 01:14:04.860]   Good news anyway.
[01:14:04.860 --> 01:14:06.180]   I think.
[01:14:06.180 --> 01:14:09.700]   I think it's a recognition that there's something else going on.
[01:14:09.700 --> 01:14:14.620]   But the algorithm is a little bit tricky because as Sarah points out, there are four
[01:14:14.620 --> 01:14:17.180]   tests for fair use and one is how much of the thing do you use.
[01:14:17.180 --> 01:14:19.220]   And that's the only algorithm that's going to be measured.
[01:14:19.220 --> 01:14:20.700]   And they're only approximating it.
[01:14:20.700 --> 01:14:21.700]   Well, I'll give you an example.
[01:14:21.700 --> 01:14:22.700]   You could whitelist us.
[01:14:22.700 --> 01:14:24.500]   You've got lots of weird takedown things.
[01:14:24.500 --> 01:14:25.500]   Yeah.
[01:14:25.500 --> 01:14:31.620]   I mean, if I started using a print song as a show open, that would not be fair use.
[01:14:31.620 --> 01:14:32.860]   And so you could whitelist us.
[01:14:32.860 --> 01:14:35.700]   But with that doesn't mean that everything we do with stuff is fair use.
[01:14:35.700 --> 01:14:38.660]   It doesn't not everything passes those four tests.
[01:14:38.660 --> 01:14:39.660]   Right.
[01:14:39.660 --> 01:14:42.260]   Hey, if you need a lawyer, you need legal zoom.
[01:14:42.260 --> 01:14:47.340]   Well, I should be very clear about this legal.
[01:14:47.340 --> 01:14:49.020]   Is that now native content?
[01:14:49.020 --> 01:14:52.460]   If I didn't like say and now a word from our sponsor.
[01:14:52.460 --> 01:14:53.980]   Your voice changes.
[01:14:53.980 --> 01:14:55.460]   Ladies and gentlemen, people know.
[01:14:55.460 --> 01:14:58.140]   I think people know what I'm doing in that.
[01:14:58.140 --> 01:14:59.140]   Yeah.
[01:14:59.140 --> 01:15:01.300]   Legal zoom is not a law firm, but legal zoom is great.
[01:15:01.300 --> 01:15:09.220]   If you need to do legal work like trademark, copyright, last wills, living trusts, form
[01:15:09.220 --> 01:15:15.300]   a business, an LLC or a S corp, legal zoom is awesome.
[01:15:15.300 --> 01:15:17.900]   Most of that stuff is just paperwork.
[01:15:17.900 --> 01:15:21.300]   You don't need to spend hundreds of dollars an hour talking to an attorney.
[01:15:21.300 --> 01:15:25.060]   You can do it all yourself on on legal zoom.com.
[01:15:25.060 --> 01:15:26.220]   And they're very transparent.
[01:15:26.220 --> 01:15:29.860]   You know exactly how much it's going to cost up front.
[01:15:29.860 --> 01:15:32.580]   They're fantastic for the basic stuff.
[01:15:32.580 --> 01:15:37.980]   Now occasionally you do have a question and that's where legal zoom has a brand new thing
[01:15:37.980 --> 01:15:40.740]   that I love, the legal zoom legal plan.
[01:15:40.740 --> 01:15:46.780]   They can connect you with an independent attorney base and at a flat rate pre negotiated flat
[01:15:46.780 --> 01:15:47.780]   rate.
[01:15:47.780 --> 01:15:48.780]   And you know, it's nice as you can.
[01:15:48.780 --> 01:15:51.980]   They have profiles of the attorney, but even reviews customer reviews.
[01:15:51.980 --> 01:15:55.220]   So you can really see what you're getting.
[01:15:55.220 --> 01:15:57.740]   Legal zoom is not a law firm and they have to buy law.
[01:15:57.740 --> 01:15:59.380]   They have to say that.
[01:15:59.380 --> 01:16:00.980]   That's why they give you such a great value.
[01:16:00.980 --> 01:16:02.420]   They don't charge you by the hour.
[01:16:02.420 --> 01:16:04.500]   Instead you get transparent pricing.
[01:16:04.500 --> 01:16:06.060]   You get customer reviews.
[01:16:06.060 --> 01:16:08.060]   So you know what you're getting up front.
[01:16:08.060 --> 01:16:12.340]   I think we should just have customer reviews for the legal business in general.
[01:16:12.340 --> 01:16:13.340]   Don't you?
[01:16:13.340 --> 01:16:15.380]   That it fix a lot of things.
[01:16:15.380 --> 01:16:19.180]   If you do need legal advice, their network of independent attorneys can provide the straightforward
[01:16:19.180 --> 01:16:22.020]   guidance you need in most states.
[01:16:22.020 --> 01:16:26.820]   There is at least in your house, you go to legal zoom.
[01:16:26.820 --> 01:16:28.300]   You know, legal zoom is awesome.

[01:16:32.620 --> 01:16:33.620]   Protect your family.

[01:16:47.460 --> 01:16:48.460]   I got a question.
[01:16:48.460 --> 01:16:49.460]   Okay.
[01:16:49.460 --> 01:16:50.460]   I just updated the iPod.
[01:16:50.460 --> 01:16:51.460]   Yeah.
[01:16:51.460 --> 01:16:52.460]   It took a while to the entire show.
[01:16:52.460 --> 01:16:53.460]   Yeah.
[01:16:53.460 --> 01:16:54.460]   I'm looking for Apple news.
[01:16:54.460 --> 01:16:55.460]   I hope you're watching.
[01:16:55.460 --> 01:16:56.460]   I'm going to go to the website.
[01:16:56.460 --> 01:16:57.460]   I'm going to go to the website.
[01:16:57.460 --> 01:16:59.460]   I'm looking for Apple news.
[01:16:59.460 --> 01:17:00.460]   Where do I get it?
[01:17:00.460 --> 01:17:01.460]   Go to your home.
[01:17:01.460 --> 01:17:02.460]   It should be on there.
[01:17:02.460 --> 01:17:03.460]   Really?
[01:17:03.460 --> 01:17:04.460]   Go home.
[01:17:04.460 --> 01:17:05.460]   It'll be probably on the front page.
[01:17:05.460 --> 01:17:07.460]   It's quite nice to be doing stand.
[01:17:07.460 --> 01:17:08.660]   They've taken newsstand off.
[01:17:08.660 --> 01:17:10.180]   You shouldn't see newsstand.
[01:17:10.180 --> 01:17:12.340]   I see newsstand with a little tiny.
[01:17:12.340 --> 01:17:15.380]   Oh, make sure you got iOS 9.
[01:17:15.380 --> 01:17:16.380]   Oh, no.
[01:17:16.380 --> 01:17:17.380]   Maybe you got 8.4.1.
[01:17:17.380 --> 01:17:22.540]   Maybe you haven't been updating religiously.
[01:17:22.540 --> 01:17:25.780]   I shouldn't see newsstand.
[01:17:25.780 --> 01:17:31.620]   General about where do I find a nine or nine.
[01:17:31.620 --> 01:17:34.860]   Why is he seeing a number nine?
[01:17:34.860 --> 01:17:36.380]   You don't see an icon that says news.
[01:17:36.380 --> 01:17:37.380]   I found it.
[01:17:37.380 --> 01:17:38.380]   I found it.
[01:17:38.380 --> 01:17:39.380]   I can't stupid things.
[01:17:39.380 --> 01:17:40.380]   I can't.
[01:17:40.380 --> 01:17:42.860]   You may have to update apps as well as the easy game.
[01:17:42.860 --> 01:17:43.860]   Yeah.
[01:17:43.860 --> 01:17:44.860]   Well, I think you get that.
[01:17:44.860 --> 01:17:45.860]   I don't know.
[01:17:45.860 --> 01:17:46.860]   Actually, I don't know.
[01:17:46.860 --> 01:17:48.020]   I haven't done it yet.
[01:17:48.020 --> 01:17:49.020]   Tell us what you think.
[01:17:49.020 --> 01:17:52.420]   Tell us what you think.
[01:17:52.420 --> 01:17:55.420]   A first look at the new news.
[01:17:55.420 --> 01:17:56.420]   Apple news.
[01:17:56.420 --> 01:17:58.660]   Wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and wait and board to do anything.
[01:17:58.660 --> 01:17:59.660]   There you go.
[01:17:59.660 --> 01:18:00.660]   That'll suck.
[01:18:00.660 --> 01:18:01.660]   It'll suck.
[01:18:01.660 --> 01:18:02.660]   It'll suck.
[01:18:02.660 --> 01:18:03.660]   It'll suck.
[01:18:03.660 --> 01:18:04.660]   It'll suck.
[01:18:04.660 --> 01:18:05.660]   It'll suck.
[01:18:05.660 --> 01:18:06.660]   It'll suck.
[01:18:06.660 --> 01:18:07.660]   It'll suck.
[01:18:07.660 --> 01:18:08.660]   It'll suck.
[01:18:08.660 --> 01:18:09.660]   It'll suck.
[01:18:09.660 --> 01:18:10.660]   It'll suck.
[01:18:10.660 --> 01:18:11.660]   It'll suck.
[01:18:11.660 --> 01:18:12.660]   It'll suck.
[01:18:12.660 --> 01:18:13.660]   It'll suck.
[01:18:13.660 --> 01:18:14.660]   It'll suck.
[01:18:14.660 --> 01:18:15.660]   It'll suck.
[01:18:15.660 --> 01:18:16.660]   I don't know.
[01:18:16.660 --> 01:18:17.660]   It'll suck.
[01:18:17.660 --> 01:18:22.020]   sources now Jeff this is this is a one-time only oh yeah yeah I've heard
[01:18:22.020 --> 01:18:26.120]   that's true yeah I guess newsstand I'm being told by the charm is still there
[01:18:26.120 --> 01:18:30.280]   as a folder so you can open the folder in your news the magazines it used to be
[01:18:30.280 --> 01:18:33.920]   in your newsstand will be in there as a standoffs so you can put it in that folder
[01:18:33.920 --> 01:18:36.520]   you put things I can't uninstall folder somewhere you've hidden on the junk
[01:18:36.520 --> 01:18:42.680]   folder every iPhone has it every if I don't use apple weather Apple stalks Apple
[01:18:42.680 --> 01:18:53.680]   tips but you can't believe them Google is invested in Oscar yeah this is it's only
[01:18:53.680 --> 01:18:57.320]   in New Jersey in New York and it's a new insurance company I'm not sure I'm just
[01:18:57.320 --> 01:19:01.760]   gonna remember now I think they were an advertiser was didn't Oscar advertise with
[01:19:01.760 --> 01:19:08.440]   us I think they did yeah so they are kind of a high-tech health insurance
[01:19:08.440 --> 01:19:14.320]   company this is one where I I was reluctant to take him as an advertiser
[01:19:14.320 --> 01:19:17.160]   because it is only New York and New Jersey but I thought what they were doing
[01:19:17.160 --> 01:19:21.600]   was so cool it really is it starts with technology tell us you're something to
[01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:25.920]   get started you can shop for a doctor pick one you like exactly just click to
[01:19:25.920 --> 01:19:33.600]   talk with a doctor right away I really liked this idea and and you know it's you
[01:19:33.600 --> 01:19:36.920]   know they said we're gonna be going into other states too so I thought well
[01:19:36.920 --> 01:19:41.000]   let's do the ads even though I mean talk about US only ads this was a New Jersey
[01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:46.200]   only but I just I you know that's another case where sometimes an
[01:19:46.200 --> 01:19:50.440]   advertiser will just I want to do their ads because I think what they're doing
[01:19:50.440 --> 01:19:54.480]   is really interesting now I'm I think that's validated by Google which has put
[01:19:54.480 --> 01:19:59.760]   32 and a half million dollars in Oscar they're now valued this fit and when you
[01:19:59.760 --> 01:20:03.720]   when you get your daily goal you got to buck off up to 240 dollars a year nice
[01:20:03.720 --> 01:20:09.280]   isn't that good so kind of incense you to take care of yourself yeah yeah they're
[01:20:09.280 --> 01:20:17.640]   1.75 billion dollar valuation so they're a unicorn and they want to make the
[01:20:17.640 --> 01:20:23.800]   health insurance business work more like an internet service oh not available
[01:20:23.800 --> 01:20:31.640]   in my area yeah that's kind of part of the I'm in New Jersey well don't know don't
[01:20:31.640 --> 01:20:38.000]   know they're focused on individuals not groups
[01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:43.960]   anyway they I really liked them anyway good good on them
[01:20:43.960 --> 01:20:47.640]   Google's really gotten involved in the medical area hasn't it there's those
[01:20:47.640 --> 01:20:52.520]   contact lenses that to detect for diabetics it's a tech well the other
[01:20:52.520 --> 01:20:58.520]   fascinating story today is they hired the top mental health official in the US
[01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:05.080]   yeah a mental health moonshot boy I'm I'm behind this Dr. Tom Insel director of
[01:21:05.080 --> 01:21:09.920]   the National Institute of Mental Health for the last 13 years he's joining
[01:21:09.920 --> 01:21:14.040]   Life Sciences that's the two-year-old research division that among others was
[01:21:14.040 --> 01:21:21.080]   spun out when Google became alphabet and they're working on mental health here's
[01:21:21.080 --> 01:21:25.080]   his statement on the NIMM website that the Life Sciences team at Google would
[01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:29.520]   establish a major exploration into mental health is by itself a significant
[01:21:29.520 --> 01:21:34.800]   statement recognizing the burden of illness from psychosis mood disorders
[01:21:34.800 --> 01:21:39.200]   and autism as well as the opportunity for technology to make a major impact to
[01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:44.840]   change the world for the millions affected this is I'm so thrilled to see
[01:21:44.840 --> 01:21:51.760]   this this is great yeah mental health treatment in the United States is
[01:21:51.760 --> 01:22:00.800]   barely medieval amen brother as some of you know as I know firsthand and it's
[01:22:00.800 --> 01:22:04.800]   not about better drugs it's just about destigmatizing it
[01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:09.720]   re-stewing the research doing the hard work but I'm glad Google's putting some
[01:22:09.720 --> 01:22:15.080]   money behind it that's great really great all right I'm picking sources now
[01:22:15.080 --> 01:22:21.400]   oh good what are your choices get news in your inbox no no no no don't do
[01:22:21.400 --> 01:22:27.120]   that to me oh I just they were there the New York Times the Guardian how about
[01:22:27.120 --> 01:22:32.240]   tech tech sources where they're like tech blogs recode yeah it's gonna be all
[01:22:32.240 --> 01:22:37.280]   the big names so then all right so the first one oh you see this is not it looks
[01:22:37.280 --> 01:22:40.320]   like Kanye West watched a lot of Star Wars while designing his latest
[01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:44.240]   collection okay that's one I don't know Apple no Apple has your first story you
[01:22:44.240 --> 01:22:49.400]   give me don't want can you can you minus that can you can you use the new
[01:22:49.400 --> 01:22:54.320]   Facebook dislike button which way do I go left right that would set them off I
[01:22:54.320 --> 01:22:58.240]   was hoping that would set them off oh can you use the new Facebook dislike
[01:22:58.240 --> 01:23:09.480]   but just listen to Zuckerberg he said this like but he said it wasn't a
[01:23:09.480 --> 01:23:15.400]   down button it's an empathy button an empathy button it's I you know I'm not
[01:23:15.400 --> 01:23:18.160]   I'm not gonna like the fact that your mother died I'm gonna give you empathy
[01:23:18.160 --> 01:23:22.680]   for that so we were getting all excited in the news business because the idea
[01:23:22.680 --> 01:23:26.200]   was kind of like Reddit style up voting and down voting right when that be
[01:23:26.200 --> 01:23:30.520]   cool and I'm sure Facebook would like to do that right no they don't want to do
[01:23:30.520 --> 01:23:34.240]   that why not because that's not he's not a work said it is town hall that's
[01:23:34.240 --> 01:23:38.200]   not the kind of community we want to build you you shared something you put
[01:23:38.200 --> 01:23:41.040]   yourself out you show something the world that all everybody comes along and
[01:23:41.040 --> 01:23:46.000]   says hmm well that's true I guess nobody in the world wants that we don't need
[01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:50.680]   more of that the world I agree with us yeah yes but we have that on Google oh
[01:23:50.680 --> 01:23:55.360]   no there's no minus one is there it's only plus one and Google plus but what
[01:23:55.360 --> 01:23:59.840]   the problem is you just you post oh just I'm really devastated my mom just died
[01:23:59.840 --> 01:24:05.560]   and then what am I supposed to do like it yeah so empathy would be like what's
[01:24:05.560 --> 01:24:11.080]   it gonna be like oh it's gonna be like a little hug Zuckerberg so I learned this
[01:24:11.080 --> 01:24:19.280]   from courts just now and Mark Zuckerberg invited Ahmed to Facebook yes the poor
[01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:22.000]   Ahmed's never gonna get to go to school anymore he's going to the White House
[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:27.400]   he's going to Facebook is he yeah MIT invited him MIT invited him he's gonna
[01:24:27.400 --> 01:24:32.520]   have to do the Ahmed Ahmed world tour well he gave me a said can you can you
[01:24:32.520 --> 01:24:37.240]   come over here and tell us why watch OS 2 wasn't released
[01:24:37.240 --> 01:24:44.520]   there was a press conference while we've been on the air I just saw the the
[01:24:44.520 --> 01:24:49.280]   lower third said that he he might consider transferring schools yeah I
[01:24:49.280 --> 01:24:55.120]   would at this point I don't think you'd want to walk that walk of shame I don't
[01:24:55.120 --> 01:24:59.800]   know what's so special about Apple lose so which a bunch of stories most of
[01:24:59.800 --> 01:25:08.200]   which aren't relevant to me from sources I already have with no no ads oh I know
[01:25:08.200 --> 01:25:13.520]   wait okay fine big deal and no way to say no I really don't like that you're
[01:25:13.520 --> 01:25:17.800]   wrong because the app of course that's the Apple attitude no you're wrong about
[01:25:17.800 --> 01:25:24.800]   us being wrong so you can't downvote that Kanye no that's the first thing
[01:25:25.360 --> 01:25:31.640]   I don't sure you're right now the New Yorker Zuckerberg how about an oof
[01:25:31.640 --> 01:25:40.720]   button for you what would be a good Yiddish boy boy boy boy boy would be good
[01:25:40.720 --> 01:25:46.800]   I'd like an oi button I that says a lot we need we need man and he told it
[01:25:46.800 --> 01:25:53.120]   I give out you know it's like a vote bigger well so the thing that's the
[01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:56.120]   interesting sort of variant on this is the thing that's slacked in with the
[01:25:56.120 --> 01:26:01.840]   emoji I don't know how much you guys use lucky you've seen this they invented
[01:26:01.840 --> 01:26:05.480]   reaction emoji so when someone post something you can react by posting an
[01:26:05.480 --> 01:26:09.600]   emoji and other people can click on that to to increment that emoji so oh wow
[01:26:09.600 --> 01:26:13.640]   so the reaction goes up so this so that if there's a count goes up for this for
[01:26:13.640 --> 01:26:16.280]   the number of people who've clicked that one so you can you can use it to put
[01:26:16.280 --> 01:26:21.680]   two like alternatives in as you know do you want you know huh burger or burger
[01:26:21.680 --> 01:26:25.720]   or fried egg and put the emoji like that but you can anyone can react with an
[01:26:25.720 --> 01:26:29.200]   emoji and then other people can sort of pile on on that emoji so there was their
[01:26:29.200 --> 01:26:35.520]   way of saying okay I suspect it was their way of getting around the whole do we
[01:26:35.520 --> 01:26:38.800]   do likes with hearts or stars argument by saying well why not all possible
[01:26:38.800 --> 01:26:43.120]   combinations of strange characters so you can react to things by sending people
[01:26:43.120 --> 01:26:50.400]   goats or hundred underlined or whatever other emoji you like best man by the way
[01:26:50.400 --> 01:26:56.880]   here's the iCloud news publisher at iCloud.com/newspublisher if you're a
[01:26:56.880 --> 01:27:00.600]   publisher can we get on this right away you can enter your publisher
[01:27:00.600 --> 01:27:05.880]   information and add your RSS feed to Apple news but you have to run it through
[01:27:05.880 --> 01:27:09.200]   an Apple shaped validator so it's it's like the podcasting one with some
[01:27:09.200 --> 01:27:15.120]   expert nonsense on it oh we can we can handle that yeah they did they they they
[01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:22.040]   made a totally unique RSS format for iTunes podcasts which by the way we
[01:27:22.040 --> 01:27:26.880]   still adhere to and interestingly enough oh I can't talk about it I'm not
[01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:32.400]   disclosed nevermind yeah I don't say you were looking for Richard to say something
[01:27:32.400 --> 01:27:35.240]   well it's not even that I'm not disclosed but the people who are not
[01:27:35.240 --> 01:27:41.960]   disclosed mentioned this to me and now I don't want to get them in trouble has to
[01:27:41.960 --> 01:27:47.640]   do with Google but I'll say over later I don't know are we is it officially yet
[01:27:47.640 --> 01:27:54.800]   or not I don't know patent for giving up or regaining control of self-driving
[01:27:54.800 --> 01:28:03.200]   car I think you need a meh button Google self-driving car patent reveals how you'll
[01:28:03.200 --> 01:28:11.600]   let AI take the wheel it's called Google chauffeur and there's an arm on the
[01:28:11.600 --> 01:28:16.680]   steering wheel kind of like your you know your turn signal that could be pulled to
[01:28:16.680 --> 01:28:20.960]   engage the self-driving mode at that point the system checks to see whether
[01:28:20.960 --> 01:28:24.920]   it's ready and able to actually take control from the driver if it can't get
[01:28:24.920 --> 01:28:28.440]   let's say get a GPS lock or something the driver could see not available on the
[01:28:28.440 --> 01:28:32.600]   dash otherwise you'll see a ready light at which point you could start taking
[01:28:32.600 --> 01:28:39.280]   your hands off the wheel and your feet off the pedals and start texting
[01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:49.880]   apparently according to this patent at 64 miles an hour using an iPhone anyway
[01:28:49.880 --> 01:28:53.320]   just because they have a patent doesn't mean they know how to do it if the
[01:28:53.320 --> 01:28:57.080]   passenger identifies an emergency situation the passenger may take control
[01:28:57.080 --> 01:29:01.400]   of the vehicle immediately if you see an obstacle the computer hasn't identified
[01:29:01.400 --> 01:29:05.760]   like a bicyclist or road construction you don't even disarm the computer you
[01:29:05.760 --> 01:29:11.280]   just grip the wheel just like cruise control yeah this is just like cruise
[01:29:11.280 --> 01:29:18.800]   control there's no news here just like cruise control and of course I say about
[01:29:18.800 --> 01:29:27.360]   Apple news meh meh meh meh meh supposedly Android pay is rolled out I'm sure you
[01:29:27.360 --> 01:29:31.800]   talked about this yesterday on all about Android did you have you got it yet
[01:29:31.800 --> 01:29:38.320]   Jason I had to install it how I had to go out of my way to install the update so
[01:29:38.320 --> 01:29:42.640]   basically it's kind of confusing I'm sorry I interrupted your lunch it's okay
[01:29:42.640 --> 01:29:47.720]   apologize I was at the end of the bite Android so it's called Android wallet
[01:29:47.720 --> 01:29:53.280]   also pay and right yeah so the old Google Wallet app is magically turning into
[01:29:53.280 --> 01:29:57.720]   Android pay right and then they pushed out a new Google Wallet app to the play
[01:29:57.720 --> 01:30:04.680]   store to be your transferring money between people app so it says I have
[01:30:04.680 --> 01:30:09.600]   Google wall installed as I would expect it also relies on a current version
[01:30:09.600 --> 01:30:17.760]   of the services which is this app will update to Android pay soon yeah so I
[01:30:17.760 --> 01:30:21.280]   guess you know this is it a staged rollout there you got it look at that
[01:30:21.280 --> 01:30:26.960]   look at that look at that look at that there we go now did you get it
[01:30:26.960 --> 01:30:31.880]   automatically yeah I didn't do anything okay let me look I had to install it
[01:30:31.880 --> 01:30:35.400]   manually in order to get it and really played around with it very much did you
[01:30:35.400 --> 01:30:40.040]   install it with a sideload yeah oh well that's not how you're supposed to do it
[01:30:40.040 --> 01:30:45.960]   yeah coming soon Android pay in a new Google wall in the next few weeks and
[01:30:45.960 --> 01:30:50.840]   Google wall will it turn into two simpler apps it's the first time I've
[01:30:50.840 --> 01:30:56.120]   ever heard well it's most popular features will move to two simpler apps
[01:30:56.120 --> 01:31:02.040]   okay I don't know what's simpler about that you guys either really use NFC
[01:31:02.040 --> 01:31:05.640]   pain I used it for the well I've used it on the watch just because I wanted to
[01:31:05.640 --> 01:31:08.480]   play with the watch yeah I don't play with it but you really use it I used it
[01:31:08.480 --> 01:31:14.760]   yesterday at the or Sunday at the Monday at the ball ball guard ball game oh
[01:31:14.760 --> 01:31:19.160]   but it's kind of just like I you know it's not that it's I use the case me but
[01:31:19.160 --> 01:31:23.200]   the thing is nationally it's not that much easier but he's since they launched
[01:31:23.200 --> 01:31:26.840]   that it's got more annoying because there are people are turning off
[01:31:26.840 --> 01:31:29.920]   selectively you know right before you would see a little science say okay I
[01:31:29.920 --> 01:31:33.320]   can use this and they'd something to be surprising work whereas now they have
[01:31:33.320 --> 01:31:36.520]   the terminal says you can use it then you can't because this like oh no this is
[01:31:36.520 --> 01:31:40.960]   CVS you can't actually use it and I did use the other day because I'd accidentally
[01:31:40.960 --> 01:31:47.680]   left my wallet at home and it's handy for that it's handy for that yeah it's
[01:31:47.680 --> 01:31:54.440]   not it's not is sufficiently quicker is the thing yes well so I use it at the
[01:31:54.440 --> 01:32:00.080]   ballpark I tap it the guy says no wait a minute and then the thing says wait a
[01:32:00.080 --> 01:32:05.720]   minute then he says okay now do it and I did it and then I still have to sign
[01:32:05.720 --> 01:32:11.040]   something which is oh no you're kidding me yeah you have to go through the flow
[01:32:11.040 --> 01:32:15.160]   basically so it's really no different than if I'd taken a credit card out and
[01:32:15.160 --> 01:32:19.560]   swiped it I mean is it's I do use the Starbucks thing every day yeah the
[01:32:19.560 --> 01:32:23.680]   start but you have a special card for that yeah so if it's under the thing
[01:32:23.680 --> 01:32:26.280]   where the credit cards and have to sign then it then it is a bit quicker but if
[01:32:26.280 --> 01:32:29.800]   it's over then you've still got to sign something yeah this was a yeah and you
[01:32:29.800 --> 01:32:35.160]   also confuse the checkup person as well yeah yeah yeah he says what does it say
[01:32:35.160 --> 01:32:41.000]   on your screen it says don't it says stop okay
[01:32:41.840 --> 01:32:50.400]   Russia says Google bad yeah like I'm gonna trust Russia Russia they did they
[01:32:50.400 --> 01:32:56.240]   you know what to their credit they got we did this fast everybody else is
[01:32:56.240 --> 01:33:00.120]   still thinking well this is what happens when you have a dictatorship
[01:33:00.120 --> 01:33:04.040]   you go yeah you can cut through a little bureaucracy Google found guilty of
[01:33:04.040 --> 01:33:08.000]   abusing dominant market position Russia Russian antitrust agency it's funny
[01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:13.840]   they have an antitrust agency yeah well you are not owned by us you are
[01:33:13.840 --> 01:33:18.160]   antitrust you know what does it even mean to be antitrust in a socialist
[01:33:18.160 --> 01:33:21.920]   republic Russians antitrust agency will have 10 business days to issue its
[01:33:21.920 --> 01:33:29.400]   ruling on the case in full they opened the probe in February so seven months
[01:33:29.400 --> 01:33:35.400]   later that's not too bad company was not found guilty of unfair competition
[01:33:36.400 --> 01:33:42.400]   but they were found a guilty of abusing their dominant market position
[01:33:42.400 --> 01:33:49.000]   they of course the the action was prompted by Russians the Russia's search
[01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:55.760]   engine Yandex they complained Yandex said quote we welcome the positive
[01:33:55.760 --> 01:34:01.120]   decision by FAS which is figured out this complicated case and having studied
[01:34:01.120 --> 01:34:08.080]   the proof has confirmed the Google's violations do you think this has any
[01:34:08.080 --> 01:34:15.760]   potential influence over what the EU is also like just from a well it was well
[01:34:15.760 --> 01:34:18.960]   they won't be alone they won't be right won't have to worry about being the
[01:34:18.960 --> 01:34:24.400]   only ones right but I don't I can't imagine the cure
[01:34:25.600 --> 01:34:31.520]   oh it seems looking we're down to the season the stems almost done here Google
[01:34:31.520 --> 01:34:36.160]   says it's not gonna make cars it's gonna license them which does go to the
[01:34:36.160 --> 01:34:43.160]   European point because because as media went baddie on on Google in Europe the
[01:34:43.160 --> 01:34:47.920]   auto industry was ready to go next yeah they were they were they were scared
[01:34:47.920 --> 01:34:52.520]   they're very scared of Google and so Google coming out and saying or in
[01:34:52.520 --> 01:34:56.800]   Frankfurt speculation at the Frankfurt Auto Show in Germany we want to look
[01:34:56.800 --> 01:35:03.920]   with you yeah it's you we do not intend to become a cop manufacturer this is
[01:35:03.920 --> 01:35:09.160]   coming from Philip Justice a Google representative yet they just hired the
[01:35:09.160 --> 01:35:14.920]   former president of Hyundai US Wow for Google Auto well that makes sense
[01:35:14.920 --> 01:35:17.280]   because you're if you're gonna deal with automakers you would like to have
[01:35:17.280 --> 01:35:22.000]   somebody in what side who is an automaker to talk the talk yes he's
[01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:26.200]   a respected guy yeah I know shows they're serious it shows they're very very
[01:35:26.200 --> 01:35:33.760]   serious have you turned on your on hub Jake did today yes and he said that the
[01:35:33.760 --> 01:35:42.120]   speed is about the same it'll across the how the only thing that proves that
[01:35:42.120 --> 01:35:48.640]   closet behind me over there yes not my dog it says that closet on point right
[01:35:48.640 --> 01:35:53.960]   now that has the router in it put your router in a closet well yeah no you're
[01:35:53.960 --> 01:35:56.360]   supposed to put it right in the middle of the room but the world that's where
[01:35:56.360 --> 01:36:02.560]   the wire is oh and so the problem is that it would improve the speed he said in
[01:36:02.560 --> 01:36:06.480]   this room but I'm the only one who gets benefit I don't know right and so I don't
[01:36:06.480 --> 01:36:09.120]   know if you bought two of them would that be okay well I'm gonna spend 400 bucks
[01:36:09.120 --> 01:36:13.280]   right now I don't know by the way this just in Ahmed has been invited to Twitter
[01:36:13.280 --> 01:36:22.480]   should I invite him let me just tweet I'm in you got a job here you could build
[01:36:22.480 --> 01:36:29.000]   clocks for us because we're never on time never on time use your clock she
[01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:35.440]   that would be your clocks that'd be good that'd be a good tweet go ahead do it
[01:36:35.440 --> 01:36:39.040]   let's do it so we're making something back the yolk they come back that'd be
[01:36:39.040 --> 01:36:48.640]   funny hey for all I know he's a big fan I don't know he's a geek you know so
[01:36:48.640 --> 01:36:54.040]   there's a tear down and I fix it of the on hub router now speakers bigger than
[01:36:54.040 --> 01:36:59.440]   it needs to be it only is used once to pair to the phone right I thought we had
[01:36:59.440 --> 01:37:02.720]   said that there was only a small speaker but no it's but a credit I fix it it's
[01:37:02.720 --> 01:37:10.400]   that's pretty it's not as big as the Sonos but it's pretty hefty that's weird
[01:37:10.400 --> 01:37:16.960]   it's not an echo the odd little plug in the speaker grill is an ambient light
[01:37:16.960 --> 01:37:21.120]   sensor which Google says doesn't work yet in fact there's a lot of stuff in
[01:37:21.120 --> 01:37:28.520]   this which doesn't work yet including Zigbee transmit you know radios and
[01:37:28.520 --> 01:37:36.840]   thread radios there's a Bluetooth radio doesn't work yet it's all sorts of stuff
[01:37:36.840 --> 01:37:43.360]   so if you I don't know if you if you care I canceled my order I think just got a
[01:37:43.360 --> 01:37:51.000]   kind of more common Asus router which I've been very happy with
[01:37:52.840 --> 01:38:03.120]   let's see what else I got a fix for the final stage fright flaw on my AT&T note
[01:38:03.120 --> 01:38:10.120]   five and on my Nexus 7 tablet have you gotten a fix yet Jason on my this this
[01:38:10.120 --> 01:38:14.200]   fun is not gotten a fix I got a security update on my Nexus 5 my my
[01:38:14.200 --> 01:38:20.000]   next my next is so six to so the first monthly security update oh this is
[01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:25.600]   gonna be a great scene yeah because I got all these pads these updates now is
[01:38:25.600 --> 01:38:29.400]   like am I getting six I didn't think I was getting six yet and then you're
[01:38:29.400 --> 01:38:33.640]   getting your monthly update to get used to it did you change the number it was
[01:38:33.640 --> 01:38:37.080]   still 511 interesting yeah but look at the bill that's where they change the
[01:38:37.080 --> 01:38:42.720]   little subtle numbers down there okay I don't I actually want a release note
[01:38:42.720 --> 01:38:45.960]   for that because that that process is very slow it's like okay I'm gonna sit
[01:38:45.960 --> 01:38:49.960]   here and like right 200 what am I doing apps in front of you yeah if you've got
[01:38:49.960 --> 01:38:54.480]   a lot of apps installed it takes a while late late late that's what everybody
[01:38:54.480 --> 01:38:59.240]   Apple Microsoft they're all just cagey about what's going on so this is the
[01:38:59.240 --> 01:39:04.080]   Moto X pure it has not been updated yet and if you by the way the stage fright
[01:39:04.080 --> 01:39:07.520]   detection to get is the zimpyrium one they're the ones who discover the flaw
[01:39:07.520 --> 01:39:14.000]   ZIMP or IUM and you see it's this let it's this one little red one there it's
[01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:18.160]   the last one to get fixed but it has been fixed now on Nexus devices it's been
[01:39:18.160 --> 01:39:24.840]   fixed on the note oddly enough Samsung fixed it but not yet on the Moto X
[01:39:24.840 --> 01:39:30.920]   by the way I've seen I haven't verified what's going on but apparently the new
[01:39:30.920 --> 01:39:35.760]   Moto phones yeah unlocked you know by yourself people aren't being able to put
[01:39:35.760 --> 01:39:41.640]   them on Verizon oh no yeah are you kidding me I don't I got very much what's
[01:39:41.640 --> 01:39:46.600]   going on but I got some tweets Jeff Bezos finally doing something with the

[01:45:50.040 --> 01:45:54.920]   give FreshBooks changes all that it makes it easy and fast to send out invoices
[01:45:54.920 --> 01:45:59.840]   invoices they get paid faster because there's a pay button right on the invoice

[01:46:35.120 --> 01:46:39.000]   billing Rogers I used FreshBooks but this is something more recent it's really
[01:46:39.000 --> 01:46:43.400]   great but they always had a great team of support folks at the FreshBooks
[01:46:43.400 --> 01:46:48.160]   headquarters they still do award winning support rock stars waiting to go above
[01:46:48.160 --> 01:46:51.920]   and beyond whenever you need a hand there they are not the cute FreshBooks

[01:47:05.360 --> 01:47:08.520]   they ask you how did you hear about us don't forget to say twig twig this week
[01:47:08.520 --> 01:47:15.000]   in Google that's where FreshBooks dot com slash twig real quick note you know
[01:47:15.000 --> 01:47:22.080]   there are fires going on up up north of us in Lake County one of the places that
[01:47:22.080 --> 01:47:30.560]   burned to the ground is a little Museum of Telephony the JKL Museum of Telephony
[01:47:30.560 --> 01:47:36.560]   lost to fire on September 10th in Mountain Ranch California was just kind
[01:47:36.560 --> 01:47:39.880]   of a labor of love
[01:47:39.880 --> 01:47:46.720]   well it's sad isn't that John Kay LaRue whose initials just happened to be the
[01:47:46.720 --> 01:47:53.920]   number five on the most telephone dial JKL they had telephones and related
[01:47:53.920 --> 01:47:59.400]   equipment from all over the world going from the 1880s to present day they were
[01:47:59.400 --> 01:48:05.000]   working on getting many of these working look at the pack Bell exhibit and these
[01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:12.280]   ancient phones and oh it makes me sad all lost lost to fire but they they want
[01:48:12.280 --> 01:48:19.280]   to rebuild it and I'm really thrilled and they say we don't know how but I think
[01:48:19.280 --> 01:48:27.280]   if you visit the site JKL Museum dot com and you can you can just give them some
[01:48:27.280 --> 01:48:32.200]   love and support anyway and they still have a huge website with photo galleries
[01:48:32.200 --> 01:48:37.840]   of all sorts of stuff so big that you could help them get it the load faster
[01:48:37.840 --> 01:48:42.560]   they probably appreciate that look at those remember those Jeff yep oh man
[01:48:42.560 --> 01:48:48.480]   you kids remember those we used to have to dial our finger a mile wait for it
[01:48:48.480 --> 01:48:52.920]   you never wanted a number with a zero in it because it's like 30 seconds it
[01:48:52.920 --> 01:48:59.720]   felt like it all the way around what the wrong number was painful oh yeah oh you
[01:48:59.720 --> 01:49:05.720]   should try texting with these phones it's murder so I just thought it
[01:49:05.720 --> 01:49:10.440]   person Jason Jason are you young enough you never saw a dial phone oh no not
[01:49:10.440 --> 01:49:16.320]   true I used to have one absolutely yeah my kids though and I'm sure Jake in in
[01:49:16.320 --> 01:49:20.400]   in their 20s I don't think they've oh no but they still talk about dialing a
[01:49:20.400 --> 01:49:24.360]   phone I think and hanging it up which is ridiculous hanging it up there's
[01:49:24.360 --> 01:49:28.160]   nothing to hang up with one of those if you hung it up really hard you'd hear
[01:49:28.160 --> 01:49:33.280]   the ring that was like that's satisfying yeah yeah yeah I'm having this phone
[01:49:33.280 --> 01:49:37.560]   down you get a little ring out of it Kevin I think you might be muted by the
[01:49:37.560 --> 01:49:43.520]   way me to it's sorry there was a plane going over oh this is so sad this
[01:49:43.520 --> 01:49:48.320]   look really look like a neat neat museum lot of course lots of people
[01:49:48.320 --> 01:49:53.440]   losing their homes in those fires we have some we have some stuff we'd
[01:49:53.440 --> 01:49:59.160]   probably be willing to donate jammer be donated this to us back back in the
[01:49:59.160 --> 01:50:07.600]   early days of the Twig cottage hello hello central hello central that is
[01:50:07.600 --> 01:50:11.480]   that is classic where did you get that John and then this one we found
[01:50:11.480 --> 01:50:15.480]   somewhere like in an antique store around here this one hangs on the wall
[01:50:15.480 --> 01:50:22.960]   this is your kitchen phone hello and I bet this sound this is Western
[01:50:22.960 --> 01:50:30.080]   Electric before they invented Bakelite that's a solid metal wow mr. Kevin
[01:50:30.080 --> 01:50:37.200]   Marks you got a tip I'm I'm a few things so one of Jeff's numbers was the the
[01:50:37.200 --> 01:50:41.080]   Google logo in 305 bytes I thought you'd like that oh that's a really interesting
[01:50:41.080 --> 01:50:44.880]   one we've we haven't really talked about that yet the original Google logo was
[01:50:44.880 --> 01:50:56.480]   how big 14k right the image and the new one yes 305 bytes well so so the thing
[01:50:56.480 --> 01:51:02.520]   is the point is that you and it's easy to draw an SVG so I got the G down to
[01:51:02.520 --> 01:51:06.880]   tweet length just by playing serifs are hard serifs are well they're actually
[01:51:06.880 --> 01:51:10.120]   they're not that hard because you know you'd actually do have cap so there's I
[01:51:10.120 --> 01:51:18.720]   just put the SVG for the G into the chat so serifs are you know serifs are a
[01:51:18.720 --> 01:51:23.040]   little harder but it's more that the a blade shapes you need to use a base a
[01:51:23.040 --> 01:51:25.720]   curves and that takes a bit more stuff but you can still do a pretty good vector
[01:51:25.720 --> 01:51:31.400]   version but it's just not yeah it's terrible and some someone else did a
[01:51:31.400 --> 01:51:41.840]   full version of the Google logo as an SVG that was fairly small you know so
[01:51:41.840 --> 01:51:44.640]   this so this guy that the kid doesn't hear he's doing it wrong he's basically
[01:51:44.640 --> 01:51:47.640]   saying oh I can construct it out of chopping slides out of a circle which
[01:51:47.640 --> 01:51:53.880]   you can but actually SVG has a path operator which is so in my one says go
[01:51:53.880 --> 01:51:57.000]   to the middle draw a horizontal line draw three quarters of a circle that's
[01:51:57.000 --> 01:52:00.720]   the G and drill two more circles you know so basically you can do it in a
[01:52:00.720 --> 01:52:08.400]   bunch of paths so the the so the you can actually you've got a graphics
[01:52:08.400 --> 01:52:12.480]   language that can draw straight lines and curves and complicated curves to the
[01:52:12.480 --> 01:52:16.640]   SVG so part of this for me is like the thing that's exciting about this because
[01:52:16.640 --> 01:52:19.840]   there's you know I don't want to go around the Google logo nonsense again but
[01:52:19.840 --> 01:52:26.880]   the SVG is actually really interesting SVG is a vector format for images which
[01:52:26.880 --> 01:52:32.840]   we've had vector flights for images for a long time if you've used a illustrator
[01:52:32.840 --> 01:52:36.880]   freehand that's a vector drawing program or if he views like picked on the Mac
[01:52:36.880 --> 01:52:42.000]   you know I'm talking a really quick draw back back back pick yeah yeah yeah
[01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:48.760]   so Mac draw rather Mac back to it back to it back draw was the the the far
[01:52:48.760 --> 01:52:53.040]   format picks was a farm for Mac draw and yeah so Mac was a bit map you draw
[01:52:53.040 --> 01:52:58.320]   dot dot dot but Mac draw you draw circles yes and it's easy to represent
[01:52:58.320 --> 01:53:02.160]   those because those are mathematical formulae right so SVG is scalable
[01:53:02.160 --> 01:53:08.040]   vector graphics it's it's a part of the web web standard it's a series of web
[01:53:08.040 --> 01:53:11.800]   standards it's basically an XML format for drawing drawing vectors and it's
[01:53:11.800 --> 01:53:15.080]   really nice because you can draw vectors that are very small and the other thing
[01:53:15.080 --> 01:53:20.160]   that's really nice about it is now that we've got all these very high DPI screens
[01:53:20.160 --> 01:53:24.720]   you don't have to store a giant bitmap to show something just draw a curve and
[01:53:24.720 --> 01:53:28.440]   so the Google logo thing was a bit weird to me because they were saying oh
[01:53:28.440 --> 01:53:32.800]   the serifs they take up too much space it's like those are just curves - right and
[01:53:32.800 --> 01:53:35.880]   we can make it look better on small screens it's like no they're just
[01:53:35.880 --> 01:53:38.720]   drawn this way to be fashionable and and yes you can make it very small SVG
[01:53:38.720 --> 01:53:42.240]   which is kind of cute but you could you could make the original Google logo
[01:53:42.240 --> 01:53:48.000]   fairly small SVG as well because you're just drawing you know swirly shapes so
[01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:54.080]   and they will still look crisp at any size and if you've got a you know a 4x like
[01:53:54.080 --> 01:53:58.400]   400 and something DPI screen like this they'll look lovely on here as well and
[01:53:58.400 --> 01:54:01.560]   you won't have to store a series of bitmaps and one of the things that's
[01:54:01.560 --> 01:54:07.880]   annoying about this is that lots of lots of the operating systems and
[01:54:07.880 --> 01:54:13.640]   websites that we use all the time are behind in the support of SVG so with
[01:54:13.640 --> 01:54:17.160]   you building iOS apps they insist on you making bitmaps for them for lots of
[01:54:17.160 --> 01:54:20.480]   things you have to have a bit back for the splash screen and you have to make one
[01:54:20.480 --> 01:54:24.520]   at different sizes for all the different iOS devices and so on you can't upload
[01:54:24.520 --> 01:54:33.960]   an SVG to Twitter or Facebook or Pinterest or you know Google+ even so
[01:54:33.960 --> 01:54:38.920]   this is frustrating so what my I did I as a kind of as a sort of tongue-in-cheek
[01:54:38.920 --> 01:54:46.920]   joke I did SVG UR dot com which is like imager but for SVGs but but
[01:54:46.920 --> 01:54:49.520]   because the point of it is is that you should be able to hand these things
[01:54:49.520 --> 01:54:52.760]   around they take almost no storage you can actually sort of paste them into
[01:54:52.760 --> 01:54:57.640]   tweets and so that's not useful so this was a little you know prank thing that
[01:54:57.640 --> 01:55:02.520]   I did a semi-jones thing I did a while ago what is this site SV UR is like
[01:55:02.520 --> 01:55:06.360]   imager for SVG image your fresh view so this is a site that I hacked together a
[01:55:06.360 --> 01:55:10.640]   while ago so I will do the past SVGs around and you'll notice that most of
[01:55:10.640 --> 01:55:13.480]   them are like me playing around with Google logos and other little bits and
[01:55:13.480 --> 01:55:18.160]   pieces indeed web logos but the but the interesting thing is that they are
[01:55:18.160 --> 01:55:21.640]   really small and compact and they're and it's a very useful way to represent
[01:55:21.640 --> 01:55:25.880]   things so if you're doing web design you should be using SVGs oh and they can
[01:55:25.880 --> 01:55:29.400]   animate to you can see the rotator and all browsers run that room properly and
[01:55:29.400 --> 01:55:33.760]   everything most browsers are in the properly I mean it's now at the point
[01:55:33.760 --> 01:55:37.120]   where all the browsers you care about render them properly unless you're really
[01:55:37.120 --> 01:55:40.920]   unfortunate you have colleagues who are running IE8 or something yeah but there
[01:55:40.920 --> 01:55:47.760]   they are you know so they passed over the install base of Flash about three
[01:55:47.760 --> 01:55:52.960]   years ago and if you look at can I use.com for SVG now it is like in the in the
[01:55:52.960 --> 01:55:58.080]   90s of install bases and it's all the mobile ones and that's where you really
[01:55:58.080 --> 01:56:02.000]   care about this because the mobile ones is where you tend to have the multiple
[01:56:02.000 --> 01:56:06.760]   DPI issues and it wouldn't be such a big deal to test the platform and if it
[01:56:06.760 --> 01:56:12.240]   can't play SVGs to offer something else but yeah no so I mean I do for SVGs I do
[01:56:12.240 --> 01:56:17.240]   a fallback thing with this for I for Twitter and Facebook I give them a
[01:56:17.240 --> 01:56:21.480]   Twitter card that has the has a ping in it and so they can display something
[01:56:21.480 --> 01:56:25.640]   but but yeah but the point is that if you're actually designing for the web
[01:56:25.640 --> 01:56:30.760]   these days and you're doing things that would represent well as vector
[01:56:30.760 --> 01:56:34.000]   graphics obviously it doesn't work for you know sunsets and things but if you're
[01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:39.320]   doing things that are actually icons and logos and graphs and anything that is
[01:56:39.320 --> 01:56:43.120]   composed of lines you're far better off using SVGs than anything else and the
[01:56:43.120 --> 01:56:47.320]   other neat trick is that you can inline them into HTML fairly straightforwardly
[01:56:47.320 --> 01:56:51.240]   I mean you could inline image into HTML by putting debut roles but SVG you just
[01:56:51.240 --> 01:56:56.240]   you can just put the SVG in line which means just text yeah and you can animate
[01:56:56.240 --> 01:56:59.760]   them too which is interesting there's animating them is a little tricksy
[01:56:59.760 --> 01:57:02.520]   there's different ways you can do that but yeah they have an intrinsic animation
[01:57:02.520 --> 01:57:07.880]   model there's a little bit less support for that then and then there's you can
[01:57:07.880 --> 01:57:10.780]   also animate them with CS animations in the same way you can
[01:57:10.780 --> 01:57:17.560]   analyze your CS anything any image so what do you use to create these you can
[01:57:17.560 --> 01:57:21.560]   use illustrator you can make them by hand or you can if you want a free thing
[01:57:21.560 --> 01:57:27.000]   there's inkscape which is a open source app I mean it runs in X Windows so it's
[01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:30.600]   a little bit weird but it's it's a fairly good SVG editor so I'm gonna add this
[01:57:30.600 --> 01:57:39.360]   to my 25 line each emails signature little animated SVG I think they may not
[01:57:39.360 --> 01:57:44.920]   display an email that's the thing email you use this sort of weird broken old
[01:57:44.920 --> 01:57:50.360]   versions of HTML like here's the here's the Singapore real map in SVG yeah that's
[01:57:50.360 --> 01:57:52.920]   nice that's so that's it that was interesting because the problem is there
[01:57:52.920 --> 01:57:57.240]   they didn't do the Texas text so each each character in there is individual
[01:57:57.240 --> 01:58:01.520]   whoa individual line which is which is not not ideal so someone was
[01:58:01.520 --> 01:58:04.040]   person is the same we need to we need to clean this up we need to fix that one
[01:58:04.040 --> 01:58:09.440]   so where can I see what the code looks like for the well don't do it on that
[01:58:09.440 --> 01:58:13.400]   one but you do it on like the people over there yeah just do just review
[01:58:13.400 --> 01:58:16.880]   source right click and do a few sort okay
[01:58:16.880 --> 01:58:26.280]   or inspect element maybe where's the code I don't see it oh it's this embedded
[01:58:26.280 --> 01:58:31.920]   image so hang on never mind that's all right I believe you mean I can just I
[01:58:31.920 --> 01:58:39.240]   could what does it kind of look like it looks like XML okay wow really wow
[01:58:39.240 --> 01:58:42.040]   that's really cool
[01:58:42.040 --> 01:58:48.120]   so jr this a good tool SVG you are you don't mind if people use it I don't
[01:58:48.120 --> 01:58:54.280]   mind if you use it I mean don't destroy it but yeah yeah sure here's a fun little
[01:58:54.280 --> 01:58:57.960]   article somebody just sent us from 2011 turns out in the Steve Jobs
[01:58:57.960 --> 01:59:02.520]   biography when Steve Wozniak was in 12th grade I remember reading this now he
[01:59:02.520 --> 01:59:10.120]   built a fake bomb he took a metronome realized it sounded the tick tick tick
[01:59:10.120 --> 01:59:13.560]   sounded like a bomb so he took the label off some big batteries taped them
[01:59:13.560 --> 01:59:18.520]   together with duct tape put it in the school locker rigged it to start taking
[01:59:18.520 --> 01:59:24.200]   faster when the locker opened that's was not just happy with a tick tick tick
[01:59:24.200 --> 01:59:27.560]   later he got called to the principal's office he thought it was because he had
[01:59:27.560 --> 01:59:33.640]   won yet again the school's top math prize instead he was confronted by police
[01:59:33.640 --> 01:59:37.880]   the principal had been summoned when the device was found bravely ran onto the
[01:59:37.880 --> 01:59:43.080]   football field clutching it to his chest and pulled the wires off
[01:59:43.080 --> 01:59:48.120]   was tried and failed to suppress his laughter he got sent he did go to he went
[01:59:48.120 --> 01:59:50.840]   to the juvenile detention center spent a night there
[01:59:50.840 --> 01:59:54.680]   but of course what did Steve Wozniak do in juvenile detention center
[01:59:54.680 --> 01:59:58.360]   he taught the other inmates how to disconnect wires from the lamps
[01:59:58.360 --> 02:00:02.280]   attached him to the bars so people got shocked when they touched them
[02:00:02.280 --> 02:00:08.200]   now that I don't know what that means but uh
[02:00:08.200 --> 02:00:12.200]   Ahmed Ahmed you are not alone
[02:00:13.160 --> 02:00:19.240]   but he was trying to make a fake bomb i was just making a clock
[02:00:19.240 --> 02:00:22.120]   Jeff Jarvis your number
[02:00:22.120 --> 02:00:26.520]   uh so we have this business insider
[02:00:26.520 --> 02:00:33.320]   um Jonah Paredy founder of buzzfeed has some surprising numbers on the
[02:00:33.320 --> 02:00:37.000]   traffic that buzzfeed gets from various sources now keep in mind that
[02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:40.200]   traffic to buzzfeed site isn't always the point of buzzfeed
[02:00:40.200 --> 02:00:43.400]   buzzfeed is really good about putting stuff everywhere buzzfeed's built
[02:00:43.400 --> 02:00:46.200]   for this distributed world we discussed earlier not a little interesting but
[02:00:46.200 --> 02:00:50.040]   how do they make money they do that because they're basically what they do is
[02:00:50.040 --> 02:00:54.520]   they sell their skill to advertisers that we can make your stuff viral too
[02:00:54.520 --> 02:00:57.000]   oh okay so it's not about the ads on buzzfeed
[02:00:57.000 --> 02:01:00.120]   not no it's it's when they make stuff it's that they want people to share it and
[02:01:00.120 --> 02:01:02.200]   it's through that sharing that they create their value
[02:01:02.200 --> 02:01:08.280]   me so they're both from new world um so 21% of its traffic comes from
[02:01:08.280 --> 02:01:16.760]   snapchat content views what 21% join snapchat's discover in late july
[02:01:16.760 --> 02:01:20.680]   it's already that big the other number is that uh it's said here 23%
[02:01:20.680 --> 02:01:26.360]   direct to the site or apps 14% youtube views 2% google search to the site
[02:01:26.360 --> 02:01:29.560]   because what are you really searching for a land of buzzfeed besides cute cats
[02:01:29.560 --> 02:01:33.640]   right six percent facebook traffic to the site but again keep in mind that's
[02:01:33.640 --> 02:01:38.840]   not necessarily the goal 27% facebook native video which is huge for them
[02:01:38.840 --> 02:01:45.720]   wow 4% images on facebook uh and 20% 21% snapchat content views
[02:01:45.720 --> 02:01:49.080]   i don't know if that has the 100% or not but uh i found that really
[02:01:49.080 --> 02:01:53.400]   interesting and and and and you know the thing of fast means about snapchat
[02:01:53.400 --> 02:01:59.960]   is that any i know lots of really really savvy social media people
[02:01:59.960 --> 02:02:03.560]   i mean we run a degree in social journalism i know lots of them
[02:02:03.560 --> 02:02:08.520]   anybody over the age of about 25 he's like a 60 year old and says
[02:02:08.520 --> 02:02:13.400]   what is this snapchat i don't get it i can't figure it out
[02:02:13.400 --> 02:02:16.840]   it's it's phenomenal how there's a there's an age barrier there
[02:02:16.840 --> 02:02:19.960]   and snapchat's huge you may say they don't make any money on ads but the very
[02:02:19.960 --> 02:02:24.680]   first thing is a pizza hut ad oh and by the way
[02:02:24.680 --> 02:02:27.960]   one of the things about snapchat
[02:02:27.960 --> 02:02:30.840]   it's not an ad
[02:02:30.840 --> 02:02:35.480]   well it is but it's a it's got other pieces
[02:02:35.480 --> 02:02:38.680]   i never use these emojis so i'm just going to try them out here
[02:02:38.680 --> 02:02:44.200]   huh? newborn puppy's ready to take on the world
[02:02:44.200 --> 02:02:48.600]   see the thing i think discover makes sense for quick hits so like i always
[02:02:48.600 --> 02:02:51.880]   thought espn sports highlights and discover which one of the things
[02:02:51.880 --> 02:02:57.800]   makes a lot of sense um that's i think that's an anti-smoking ad
[02:02:58.040 --> 02:03:02.120]   maybe not no labeling no what no i guess not yeah
[02:03:02.120 --> 02:03:05.480]   it's definitely it's definitely anti-smoking oh yeah see truth
[02:03:05.480 --> 02:03:09.640]   that isn't that that's a paid ad conquering home luck or maybe they
[02:03:09.640 --> 02:03:13.080]   it's not paid i don't know don't know what that is
[02:03:13.080 --> 02:03:18.360]   face aerobics now if you slide up you get more
[02:03:18.360 --> 02:03:22.920]   someday you get the rest of it so these are these are little
[02:03:22.920 --> 02:03:27.240]   snippets from the bigger viral video or whatever that they're
[02:03:27.240 --> 02:03:32.680]   where will i mean my true love it's horoscope
[02:03:32.680 --> 02:03:38.360]   photo that will give you major bold lipstick goals
[02:03:38.360 --> 02:03:44.280]   not me these are girls not to kiss oh go ahead let's try it no these are
[02:03:44.280 --> 02:03:49.080]   these are the girls you don't want to kiss you get all over you
[02:03:49.080 --> 02:03:53.720]   and back to smoking oh it says ad there is a little tiny
[02:03:53.720 --> 02:03:56.840]   almost invisible ad you can't see it but i can see it
[02:03:56.840 --> 02:04:02.040]   right at the lower right there
[02:04:02.040 --> 02:04:07.880]   oh man i guess teenagers like this

[02:04:28.840 --> 02:04:32.680]   moment well i get it but these folks is is i can't
[02:04:32.680 --> 02:04:35.960]   figure out what to do with it i can't figure out you know i bring my company
[02:04:35.960 --> 02:04:38.440]   to it i don't know what to do yeah how many of the things that you're gonna

[02:04:42.280 --> 02:04:45.720]   entertainment that's all this is and this i don't when i don't like about
[02:04:45.720 --> 02:04:50.520]   snap feet i'm trying to get back here we go snap chat snap chat is um
[02:04:50.520 --> 02:04:53.800]   grandpa right i don't like about the snap feed
[02:04:53.800 --> 02:04:57.480]   is uh that everything disappears i know that's what the kids like but i don't
[02:04:57.480 --> 02:05:00.760]   want to spend any time making content there's a new feature which i can't get
[02:05:00.760 --> 02:05:03.480]   to work uh on android but it works in the
[02:05:03.480 --> 02:05:06.600]   iPhone if you're going to take a selfie and you hold your
[02:05:06.600 --> 02:05:11.480]   you press and hold your head uh it will start doing weird animated stuff to
[02:05:11.480 --> 02:05:16.440]   your head yes have you tried that i have seen
[02:05:16.440 --> 02:05:19.480]   examples of that but i'm trying i can't get to work on android it says only
[02:05:19.480 --> 02:05:22.440]   new or android funds as soon as you can get but it doesn't work
[02:05:22.440 --> 02:05:26.360]   well done buzzfeed you've figured you've cracked the internet
[02:05:26.360 --> 02:05:33.560]   it's snap chat yep you know yahoo pulled it off remember yahoo had a katie
[02:05:33.560 --> 02:05:39.080]   correct news update yeah i don't know why maybe they weren't getting 21 percent
[02:05:39.080 --> 02:05:44.680]   content views from it i wonder if that the the content view is when i it does
[02:05:44.680 --> 02:05:47.400]   that count when i slide up is that a content view
[02:05:47.400 --> 02:05:51.800]   that's a good question too content view to i can't because snap chat doesn't
[02:05:51.800 --> 02:05:54.360]   really give you a way to link to a website right
[02:05:54.360 --> 02:05:59.800]   do you know so they must say what are they what in fact what are they saying
[02:05:59.800 --> 02:06:02.680]   what is that about that page that you're looking at
[02:06:02.680 --> 02:06:08.120]   yeah this is so this is discovered on snapchat these are brands taste made
[02:06:08.120 --> 02:06:14.520]   i.g.n. mashable iHeartRadio um cnn so you go to the brand
[02:06:14.520 --> 02:06:21.880]   and they make snapchat specific content so in the case of news
[02:06:21.880 --> 02:06:26.920]   it just and this just keeps repeating boy this is boy this is news isn't it
[02:06:26.920 --> 02:06:33.320]   this is hardcore news that's it's an ad this isn't ad for the news yes
[02:06:33.320 --> 02:06:35.880]   and then you swipe it and you get something else
[02:06:35.880 --> 02:06:39.000]   now see this now becomes more content because i swipe it up
[02:06:39.000 --> 02:06:42.760]   and there's an actual story i bet you that's what buzzfeed counts as a
[02:06:42.760 --> 02:06:46.600]   driving traffic is a reference right because there's nothing else you can't
[02:06:46.600 --> 02:06:50.600]   count yeah it's aimed at the under 20 set
[02:06:50.600 --> 02:06:55.560]   that's for sure that's for dang sure here at tunday uses it
[02:06:55.560 --> 02:07:00.360]   makes a snapatundi every day he's making snapatundi i got a number for you you
[02:07:00.360 --> 02:07:05.160]   want to know my number yeah can you get a wide shot
[02:07:05.400 --> 02:07:11.240]   this is my number five point four pounds
[02:07:11.240 --> 02:07:15.240]   that was this sunday's new york times five
[02:07:15.240 --> 02:07:19.400]   point four pounds that's not a record i'm sure
[02:07:19.400 --> 02:07:23.160]   oh nothing the old days no but it's the people suddenly it's the first time
[02:07:23.160 --> 02:07:26.920]   that you have any hept look at this size this thing
[02:07:26.920 --> 02:07:31.080]   is all the arts leisure preview stuff i think a high level advertising
[02:07:31.080 --> 02:07:34.040]   but you can't tell me they're not making money on the print uh
[02:07:34.040 --> 02:07:37.560]   that on that they're making money on that issue they made money
[02:07:37.560 --> 02:07:43.960]   yeah five point four pounds so i'll give you a quick summary on the
[02:07:43.960 --> 02:07:47.240]   moto x pure because i got it first of all i love moto maker
[02:07:47.240 --> 02:07:49.880]   um they that's the the feature that moto x
[02:07:49.880 --> 02:07:53.480]   moto roller gives you to build your own many many different possibilities
[02:07:53.480 --> 02:07:57.560]   plastic wood and leather backs i got the nice ebony back which i think is quite
[02:07:57.560 --> 02:08:02.600]   pretty uh had bamboo one year i had leather another year
[02:08:02.600 --> 02:08:06.440]   um and this champagne color in the you know so you can control a lot of this
[02:08:06.440 --> 02:08:10.520]   you can even get your name on it although it's not engraved it's just kind of
[02:08:10.520 --> 02:08:15.320]   cheaply printed on there um i the moto the first moto x
[02:08:15.320 --> 02:08:18.360]   back in 2013 was really the phone of the year for me i was really impressed with
[02:08:18.360 --> 02:08:21.960]   what i could do um and each year they've come out with
[02:08:21.960 --> 02:08:25.720]   some new features this is five point seven inches very high res
[02:08:25.720 --> 02:08:32.200]   uhd or not uhd quad hd screen it's snappy they only put three gigs of ram in
[02:08:32.200 --> 02:08:35.400]   it's not a beast because it's cheap it's a four about four hundred bucks depending
[02:08:35.400 --> 02:08:39.960]   on how much storage you have you can either get uh 32 or 64 gigs of
[02:08:39.960 --> 02:08:45.480]   or maybe 16 32 no i have to look it up i got the 64 gigs and i didn't really
[02:08:45.480 --> 02:08:48.040]   need to because the other thing that's cool about this
[02:08:48.040 --> 02:08:52.680]   is you could put a SD card in it and this goes up to 128 gigs so i have 128
[02:08:52.680 --> 02:08:55.400]   SD cards that'll be a problem moves up back and forth
[02:08:55.400 --> 02:08:59.880]   uh it's a lot easier much easier now on lollipop than it was before but
[02:08:59.880 --> 02:09:02.920]   generally you keep the apps on the internal storage
[02:09:02.920 --> 02:09:06.760]   and the external storage is for pictures music movies i have all my audio books
[02:09:06.760 --> 02:09:09.720]   on here and stuff like that it's very snappy this is only a
[02:09:09.720 --> 02:09:12.760]   Qualcomm snapdragon 808 it's not the latest greatest
[02:09:12.760 --> 02:09:17.240]   but that is probably not a bad thing i don't think you need all that horsepower
[02:09:17.240 --> 02:09:22.200]   in the note five another devices it's got the great
[02:09:22.200 --> 02:09:27.240]   Motorola stuff so uh they've always been really good about this it is an LCD
[02:09:27.240 --> 02:09:31.080]   screen not an OLED so when you hover your hand over it gives you the time
[02:09:31.080 --> 02:09:35.160]   and notifications but because it's an led uh it has to
[02:09:35.160 --> 02:09:39.320]   LCD it has to turn on the whole screen which the old OLEDs did not have to do
[02:09:39.320 --> 02:09:42.600]   it also has the gestures you know you do this to take a picture and it pretty
[02:09:42.600 --> 02:09:45.560]   quickly goes into the it's hard to do it in this
[02:09:45.560 --> 02:09:49.480]   camera over my shoulder camera never mind it never does that
[02:09:49.480 --> 02:09:53.080]   chop to turn on the flashlight there you go that one worked
[02:09:53.080 --> 02:10:00.760]   and there's also a way to get it to do a kind of a personal
[02:10:00.760 --> 02:10:04.920]   stop it thank you a personal google now
[02:10:04.920 --> 02:10:07.960]   interaction by just lifting it to your ear but you have to do this kind of
[02:10:07.960 --> 02:10:10.840]   thing and i've never been able to get it to work quite right
[02:10:10.840 --> 02:10:13.640]   um they hear there's some negatives though there's no fingerprint reader
[02:10:13.640 --> 02:10:18.360]   there's no ois 20 megapixel camera 21 megapixel camera means it's got
[02:10:18.360 --> 02:10:22.520]   great images i'm gonna do a full review on this but i have to say battery life
[02:10:22.520 --> 02:10:26.440]   is a little disappointing once again it's maybe eight or nine hours for me which
[02:10:26.440 --> 02:10:30.920]   is not long enough i wish it had a fingerprint reader it needs ois
[02:10:30.920 --> 02:10:34.440]   the 21 megapixel camera is pretty good i'll show you real quickly some photos
[02:10:34.440 --> 02:10:40.040]   from google that i've taken some does well in broad daylight but the
[02:10:40.040 --> 02:10:43.720]   neat thing about 21 megapixels is you can do digital zoom on this is actually
[02:10:43.720 --> 02:10:48.440]   zoomed in um but you get pretty good resolution you can also control the
[02:10:48.440 --> 02:10:51.480]   exposure with a slider so you see i dimmed it down until we could actually
[02:10:51.480 --> 02:10:56.440]   see the sunset um i took these of a tire swing so that's not very interesting
[02:10:56.440 --> 02:11:02.280]   it has a selfie flash front facing flash does great in broad daylight uh here's
[02:11:02.280 --> 02:11:05.640]   some other zoom shots let me show you real quickly uh an example sorry about
[02:11:05.640 --> 02:11:09.640]   all these these are all panorama you know
[02:11:09.640 --> 02:11:15.400]   um i don't want okay so this is heavily zoomed i'll show you the
[02:11:15.400 --> 02:11:21.320]   original shot is here i zoomed in with digital zoom and because you have
[02:11:21.320 --> 02:11:25.640]   so many megapixels this i find it interesting you really can take advantage
[02:11:25.640 --> 02:11:30.680]   of the extra megapixels by getting a very high quality uh you know there's
[02:11:30.680 --> 02:11:37.960]   not a lot of um artifacting in here uh high quality shot even zoomed in
[02:11:37.960 --> 02:11:41.720]   so um that's kind of nice so it's a good camera in daylight not so great in
[02:11:41.720 --> 02:11:47.400]   low light especially without ois but i have to say it's a nice camera
[02:11:47.400 --> 02:11:52.840]   i mean nice phone um i just don't think it's really up there with the top of the
[02:11:52.840 --> 02:11:56.920]   line phones unless you really want a wooden or leather back
[02:11:56.920 --> 02:12:01.000]   i'm not crazy about i feel like this is this would have been a great phone last
[02:12:01.000 --> 02:12:04.280]   year and gosh darn it they got to get the battery life better
[02:12:04.280 --> 02:12:06.840]   you weren't considering this were you jeff this wasn't one of the phones you
[02:12:06.840 --> 02:12:11.560]   were thinking about nope nope you are waiting to hear what
