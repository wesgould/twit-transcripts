[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.040]   It's a big fork.
[00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.360]   This week in Google is brought to you

[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.320]   This week in Google, which really
[00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.840]   is going to be this week in Facebook, Amazon,
[00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.280]   maybe a little Google thrown in for the fun.
[00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.760]   Let's say hello to our panelists,
[00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.400]   starting with on my left, Gina Trappani of smarterware.org.
[00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.400]   Hi, Gina.
[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.240]   Hi, how's it going?
[00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.160]   Going great.
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:09.720]   I'm going to be down your way in a couple of weeks.
[00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.360]   I'm going on vacation.
[00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:12.000]   Oh.
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.600]   Yes.
[00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.680]   Going to stay at the Hotel Del Coronado.
[00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:15.720]   Is that a nice place?
[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:16.920]   Oh, beautiful.
[00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.720]   You must do the Sunday brunch.
[00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:19.480]   It's amazing.
[00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.800]   Oh, what a nice--
[00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:20.480]   Yes, Hotel Del.
[00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.440]   That's where they filmed that Marilyn Monroe movie.
[00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:24.160]   Some like it hot, I think.
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.720]   Some like it hot.
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.960]   And also one of my favorite Peter O'Toole movies,
[00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.760]   is "A Stunt Man" was filmed there.
[00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:29.840]   Oh, you'll love it.
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:30.340]   Yeah.
[00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.400]   So that's why I wanted to stay there,
[00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.120]   because I kind of have this image from the movies
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.360]   in my head of this classic old place.
[00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.960]   So apparently it's got a very nice beach out back.
[00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:39.520]   It does.
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:40.040]   It does.
[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.120]   That's exciting.
[00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.400]   That's what I required.
[00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.640]   Well, we'll get together.
[00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:44.240]   Excellent.
[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.720]   I'm down there for CTIA.
[00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.360]   I'm just going to do one little thing,
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.320]   and then I'll be having fun.
[00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.800]   Cool.
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.760]   Also here, Jeff Jarvis, whose book is officially out.
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:55.760]   Yay.
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:56.260]   Yay.
[00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:57.260]   Public parts.
[00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:58.560]   [SINGING]
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.320]   And then he froze.
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.220]   You know, that's a good shot.
[00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.460]   You're going to get frozen?
[00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.960]   That's a good shot to get frozen on Jeff.
[00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.080]   That's a really good shot.
[00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.700]   Let's just leave it like that.
[00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.240]   Buzzmachine.com is his blog.
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:12.020]   That's where he blogs.
[00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.360]   And of course, @Jeff Jarvis on Twitter.
[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.640]   Let's switch to camera three.
[00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.620]   Danny Sullivan, who's reaching over to get his book from search
[00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:21.680]   engine.
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.960]   You wrote that too?
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.160]   Amazing.
[00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.700]   Just don't show this part here.
[00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.660]   And it's OK.
[00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:29.660]   Buy some guy.
[00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:30.940]   You don't know who.
[00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.540]   Search Engine Land is the great blog about all things search.
[00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.820]   Somebody said SEO is out.
[00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.380]   It's SMO is the new thing.
[00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.540]   Oh, yeah.
[00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:43.540]   Yeah.
[00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.540]   They're both good things for people to be doing.
[00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.660]   So people keep mistakenly thinking that somehow social media
[00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.420]   is pushing away from Google.
[00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.760]   And I keep saying, no, the pie that of ways--
[00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.500]   if you think of the ways you're going to get traffic
[00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.880]   to your website, that pie has gotten larger.
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.160]   It's not like the Google slice got smaller.
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.640]   It keeps growing and growing and growing.
[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.520]   It's just that we have a big giant Facebook pie,
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.400]   and a big giant Twitter pie, a big giant Google plus pie.
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.840]   So you know, pie for everybody.
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.680]   You got to optimize for everything.
[00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:16.480]   Social media, search.
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.240]   Just optimize.
[00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.760]   Get you a piece of the pie.
[00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.120]   Public parts just came out.
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.680]   Simon and Schuster.
[00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.120]   And actually, I want to take some time talking to you about that.
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.180]   Maybe you know what we should do, Jeff?
[00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:28.680]   We should get you on a triangulation, our interview show.
[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:29.760]   I would be honored.
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:30.520]   Let's do that.
[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.160]   And then we'll just do a whole hour.
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.860]   We'll take a big time on it now, yeah.
[00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:34.200]   Yeah.
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.800]   Well, I mean, it's germane to everything
[00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:38.280]   we talk about on this show.
[00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.760]   But you're right.
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.720]   I'd like to have a whole hour just talking to you.
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:41.880]   So we'll book that in.
[00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.440]   I'll talk to your public sister, Shelley.
[00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.640]   You can talk to me.
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.960]   Also here from searchengineland.com, the great Danny Sullivan.
[00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.280]   Welcome back, Danny.
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:54.040]   Thank you for having me.
[00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.680]   You've probably been as busy as we have this morning.
[00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.880]   We got up early 10 AM Eastern time.
[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.680]   That's 7 AM R time to cover the Amazon Kindle announcement.
[00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.800]   There was a Facebook announcement yesterday.
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.400]   Next week, there's an Apple announcement.
[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.640]   It's the season of the announcements.
[00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:10.160]   It is.
[00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.480]   It's like I always joke about it on tech mean.
[00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.720]   It's what plays rock, paper, scissors.
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.120]   And right now, Amazon crushed Apple, which crushed Facebook
[00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.880]   before that.
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.360]   So it's probably people to Google to come up with something
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.720]   else before Apple can come in and stomp on them.
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.440]   Well, as we begin recording, there's
[00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:32.920]   a huge story, which we will get to about Samsung making a deal
[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:37.280]   with Apple and a significant deal from Google's point of view
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.720]   as well.
[00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.720]   In fact, it could really mean some big bad news for Android
[00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:42.160]   in some ways.
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.400]   But we'll talk about that in a second.
[00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.640]   But first, let's start with the Amazon story.
[00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:50.040]   Three new kindles, kind of a smaller Kindle classic.
[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.280]   No more keyboard on the bottom.
[00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:52.360]   Hallelujah.
[00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:57.000]   The classic adds subsidized $79.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.640]   Boys, are they getting that price down?
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.200]   Then in the middle, we've got the Amazon Kindle Touch,
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.360]   which is essentially a classic, except that the screen is
[00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.840]   touchscreen.
[00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.920]   So you can turn the page by tapping the screen.
[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:08.960]   That's a little more money.
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.000]   Frankly, I'm not sure why people would buy that.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.480]   I guess because it's so hard to use a keyboard on the classic.
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.440]   You have to use the rocker switch to go to the letter you want.
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.120]   Press click to highlight it.
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:22.240]   It's a little bit like entering a text on a PlayStation 3
[00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:23.720]   or an Xbox.
[00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.480]   And then finally, the big story, which
[00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:28.120]   is the color Kindle, the Kindle Fire.
[00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:33.080]   Big surprise, $199 price point does include one month
[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:37.280]   of Amazon Prime is Wi-Fi only.
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:41.480]   A very impressive device looks a lot like a BlackBerry playbook.
[00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:46.120]   In fact, that's probably because it came from the same people.
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:50.160]   It is about content, content, content, content,
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:56.640]   and not once during this event did Amazon mention Google
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:58.920]   or Android or anything.
[00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:59.760]   We don't even know.
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:00.920]   We know it's Android under the hood,
[00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.200]   but we don't even know what version of Android is.
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:04.840]   I'll be eager to hear what Gina says about this,
[00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:06.800]   but she says that she's muted.
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.440]   Oh, unmute yourself, Gina.
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:09.040]   Or maybe it says--
[00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:10.040]   No, no, she said on your end.
[00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:11.200]   We've muted her.
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:11.800]   My goodness.
[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:12.680]   What is going on?
[00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:13.560]   We didn't mean to mute you.
[00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:14.880]   While we're unmuting--
[00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:16.600]   Well, we're trying to clever segue there.
[00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:20.280]   While we're unmuting, let me show the video, which is not muted.
[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:24.720]   If you pull that up of the Kindle Fire ad.
[00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:30.120]   The instruction we find in books is like fire.
[00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:31.320]   We fetch it from our neighbors--
[00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:32.520]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.240]   --Kendell at home.
[00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:34.760]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:36.520]   Communicated to others.
[00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:39.880]   And it becomes property of all.
[00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:43.320]   From Kindle, fire is born.
[00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:49.600]   A Kindle for movies, music, web, games, and reading.
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:50.400]   Kindle Fire.
[00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:53.880]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:56.120]   Predictions, predictions, predictions.
[00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:58.760]   Let's start with Gina, since we've unmuted you now.
[00:06:58.760 --> 00:06:59.400]   You can hear me?
[00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:00.240]   I hear you.
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:00.240]   Yeah.
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:01.240]   Awesome.
[00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:02.640]   Yeah.
[00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:04.360]   This is such a great announcement today.
[00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:07.920]   And I'm totally fired up about the Kindle Fire.
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:10.280]   I think it's a really, really well done.
[00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:11.360]   The price point is amazing.
[00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:14.080]   This is going to get tablets into the hands of people
[00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:16.720]   who are not nerds and Android out there.
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:20.560]   And I feel like there are lots of knockoff Android devices.
[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.920]   But this is like Amazon's Android device.
[00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:25.320]   So I feel like this really makes Android kind
[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:26.840]   of the mobile platform.
[00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:28.480]   So I think it's really interesting.
[00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:29.880]   Although I'm definitely going to buy one.
[00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:32.880]   Although I was thinking about all of my favorite apps on Android
[00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:34.560]   happen in the Google Apps because I'm just
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:36.640]   sort of embedded in the Google ecosystem.
[00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:38.200]   So I tweeted earlier, joking around,
[00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:41.800]   that if Google makes Gmail and voice and Maps and the Google
[00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:44.520]   Plus app available in the Amazon App Store,
[00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:46.320]   I'll really love the fire.
[00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:47.000]   But will they?
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.320]   That's the question, right?
[00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:48.960]   I mean--
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:49.920]   Doubtful.
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:51.520]   I would guess, although we don't know,
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.920]   that you will not be able to go to the Android marketplace
[00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:54.720]   to buy apps for this.
[00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:56.040]   You'll have to get it from Amazon.
[00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:57.920]   And it'll be the apps they approve.
[00:07:57.920 --> 00:07:58.840]   Right.
[00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:00.240]   It is a tablet.
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:05.680]   And arguably, the next most successful Android tablet
[00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:08.480]   is actually the Nook.
[00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:09.080]   That's true.
[00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:11.840]   People have rooted and turned into a true Android tablet.
[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:13.200]   But that's about the closest.
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:14.400]   This is a lot faster.
[00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:18.760]   The Nook is an 800 megahertz single core Cortex-A8 processor.
[00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:21.200]   This is the TI-OMAP for running at--
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:25.920]   it's unclear-- 1 to 1.2 gigahertz.
[00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:28.080]   Lots of memory on this, 8 gig storage.
[00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:29.840]   But Amazon was at great pains to say,
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:31.640]   it's all about the cloud, baby.
[00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:34.080]   In fact, they said about 18 times
[00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:36.360]   that your books will store them for you.
[00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:37.840]   Will store your content for you.
[00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:39.160]   It'll always be available.
[00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:41.880]   And I really think that that's a backhanded slap to Apple.
[00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:43.080]   In fact, they even showed a core.
[00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:44.200]   You don't need this either.
[00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:45.640]   You got Wi-Fi sinking.
[00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:47.240]   Jeff, what do you think?
[00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:48.440]   Well, it fascinated me most.
[00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:49.800]   There were some quotes today that said
[00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:51.120]   that they don't see this as a device.
[00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:52.960]   They see it as a service.
[00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:55.600]   And I think that's critical.
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:09:00.720]   Steve Rubell said that Amazon is selling a device
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:02.000]   so they can sell content.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.840]   Apple sells content so they can sell a device.
[00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:06.440]   And I think that's not wrong.
[00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:09.640]   And so the attitude here, I think, changes.
[00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:11.640]   It doesn't matter what the device is to some extent.
[00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:13.560]   I use Kindle software on my iPad.
[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:15.400]   They'll still give me that on my iPad.
[00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:18.640]   This is just a way, as Gina said, to get it in more hands.
[00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:21.960]   I can't imagine why you would get this if you have an iPad
[00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:25.680]   or an Android tablet of any size.
[00:09:25.680 --> 00:09:26.520]   Because it does limit it.
[00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:27.560]   It doesn't have the camera.
[00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:29.920]   You can't get to the Google stuff and all those things.
[00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:32.680]   So to me, it's 4 grandma and grandpa.
[00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:34.680]   Can you do everything on the iPad
[00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:37.000]   that you could do on the fire?
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.240]   I think that probably the video media playing
[00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:43.240]   isn't a smooth and the store--
[00:09:43.240 --> 00:09:44.920]   And you can't direct download.
[00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:47.400]   But I presume I guess you could buy stuff or rent stuff
[00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:48.600]   on the Amazon store and play it on--
[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:49.440]   I don't know.
[00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:49.960]   Exactly.
[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:52.440]   You can't get it on your iPad.
[00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:54.440]   So it's comparable to--
[00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:56.280]   so in other words, it's not better than an iPad,
[00:09:56.280 --> 00:09:57.720]   except maybe it's smaller than an iPad.
[00:09:57.720 --> 00:09:58.640]   It's smaller, right?
[00:09:58.640 --> 00:09:59.640]   And cheaper.
[00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:00.640]   Yeah.
[00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:01.640]   Yeah, a lot cheaper.
[00:10:01.640 --> 00:10:03.320]   But that's the point.
[00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:06.560]   If you already have an iPad, do you want this?
[00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:07.560]   I don't know.
[00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:10.320]   And I don't know that Amazon needs you to have it.
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:11.320]   That's the--
[00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:12.720]   Ah, they don't care.
[00:10:12.720 --> 00:10:14.360]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:16.600]   I wrote an open letter to Mel Carmer's
[00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:20.040]   in it serious years ago with the usual hubris saying,
[00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:21.520]   don't look at yourself as a satellite company.
[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:22.800]   Look at yourself as a content company.
[00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:25.120]   Put Howard Stern everywhere.
[00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:26.720]   And let me get him as a podcast.
[00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:27.720]   They didn't get it.
[00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:30.600]   And no, but that's all right.
[00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:33.240]   But I think that Amazon does get that.
[00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:35.640]   And we now understand why they have an app store.
[00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:37.280]   We know why they have the cloud storage.
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:39.800]   But it's not as if they're going to drive the business.
[00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:42.440]   The business is clearly not this device.
[00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:44.360]   This device is the lost leader.
[00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:48.160]   So they want to serve you content and store your content
[00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:51.680]   and sell your content on any device at all.
[00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:52.840]   So it doesn't matter to them.
[00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:55.160]   I don't think if they buy this device-- if you do buy this
[00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:57.520]   device, yeah, you're more tied to them.
[00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:00.840]   You know, they can knock down the nook and all that.
[00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:05.400]   But they're happy to be, I think, on your iPad or your Android
[00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:05.800]   tablet.
[00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:06.760]   Don't you think so?
[00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:08.560]   There's one big difference.
[00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:10.560]   And Danny, I think you might be able to comment on this.
[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:14.120]   In fact, Andy Inato, who was at the event today, said,
[00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:14.480]   you know what?
[00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:17.120]   The sleeper announcement of this is not the hardware.
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:19.600]   It's this silk browser.
[00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:22.440]   Amazon's got a new browser based on WebKit
[00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:26.000]   that will essentially-- they'll cash everything for you
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.280]   in the browser ahead of time.
[00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:30.720]   And this is a very interesting play.
[00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:32.920]   This is something you will not be able to get probably
[00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:33.520]   on the iPad.
[00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:34.560]   Or maybe you will, I don't know.
[00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:37.680]   But right now, you can only get it on the fire.
[00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:39.200]   It would be in Amazon's interest, wouldn't it,
[00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:42.640]   to put silk on every platform?
[00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:44.480]   Danny, what do you think?
[00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:45.960]   Well, I mean, I'm mixed.
[00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:47.640]   I got one of the nooks.
[00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:51.520]   And I returned it quickly after realizing--
[00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:54.320]   I started with the Kindle earlier this year.
[00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:56.120]   I had been hesitant on using ebooks
[00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:57.640]   because I kind of liked the idea of I had a book
[00:11:57.640 --> 00:11:59.480]   and I could do whatever I wanted with it.
[00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:00.800]   And then I started using it.
[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:01.960]   And I got the nook because I thought,
[00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:04.320]   this will be an alternative to the Kindle.
[00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:06.040]   Because I'd like to read in the dark.
[00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:08.280]   And I'd like to be able to actually touch it and whatever.
[00:12:08.280 --> 00:12:10.720]   And I realized that the nook itself--
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:12.200]   and I'll get back to the Kindle--
[00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:15.240]   but the nook being an Android device really
[00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:16.880]   didn't deserve to be called that name.
[00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:20.280]   It was simply Android so buried under the hood
[00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:23.040]   that if you wanted to run any of the Android apps that I'd
[00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:24.680]   already bought and I'd already purchased
[00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:28.120]   and I'd already used on my other Android devices like my phone,
[00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:30.680]   I either didn't get them or I had to buy them new
[00:12:30.680 --> 00:12:32.920]   and I had the only one from nook itself.
[00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:33.680]   So--
[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:34.920]   That's frustrating, isn't it?
[00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:35.600]   That is true.
[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:36.280]   And it's crazy.
[00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:39.320]   And if you are somebody who has, let's say, an Android phone
[00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:41.960]   and you've purchased some game or some application
[00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:44.000]   that you like using, are you now going
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:45.720]   to have to go through and purchase it again
[00:12:45.720 --> 00:12:49.320]   because it turns out that the Android fire--
[00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:53.360]   sorry, the Kindle Fire doesn't actually run it
[00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:57.160]   because it can't run it but because Amazon perhaps
[00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:00.120]   chooses not to allow you to run it because they don't want
[00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:02.960]   to have anybody using stuff that's not in their own app store.
[00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:05.640]   And I don't know what that case is.
[00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:07.320]   What I do know is anybody who talks about it
[00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:10.000]   as being an Android device until we actually
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.840]   see just how cross Android-ish it is, if you will,
[00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:15.560]   I wouldn't necessarily call it that.
[00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:21.040]   It might as well be Amazon tablet with Android being
[00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:22.560]   very buried underneath it.
[00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:24.080]   The price points, I think, are great.
[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:27.240]   I mean, I agree that if you've been looking for a tablet
[00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:28.800]   and you like the idea that you just kind of want
[00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:32.280]   to surf the web, you're buying things from Amazon
[00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:34.640]   such as music or in particular books, which
[00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:37.240]   is there's still their strength.
[00:13:37.240 --> 00:13:38.160]   This can be a no-brainer.
[00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:41.680]   I mean, really, the $79 Kindle is awesome, right?
[00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:42.680]   I ordered that too.
[00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:44.040]   I bought both of them.
[00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:45.040]   Yeah.
[00:13:45.040 --> 00:13:46.360]   I mean, I bought two today.
[00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:48.640]   I mean, I bought the touch and I bought the Kindle Fire.
[00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:50.160]   I want to look at them both.
[00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:52.200]   The Kindle 79, I almost wanted.
[00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:54.280]   But I thought the touch-- I'm probably not
[00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:55.600]   going to use the touch.
[00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:57.000]   Well, fine with the buttons.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:13:58.400]   But that's an interesting thing there, too,
[00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:00.400]   is I take a lot of notes in my book.
[00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:02.040]   So I use them, especially for an on-fiction.
[00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:05.320]   So I don't know whether the Kindle--
[00:14:05.320 --> 00:14:08.560]   you notice they didn't stop selling the old Kindle, right?
[00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:10.440]   Now it's called Kindle Keyboard.
[00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:12.360]   So what I suspect is that--
[00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:14.320]   Do they still have the big one, Danny?
[00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:17.360]   My dioxies, the Kindle ZX still sell as well.
[00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:19.320]   And I suspect what happens is--
[00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:21.200]   I'd love to play with them, but I suspect
[00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:24.040]   that the Kindle Touch will have an on-screen keyboard.
[00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:24.840]   Yes, it will.
[00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:26.160]   We've seen it.
[00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:30.440]   So for me, that is going to be well worth the extra $20,
[00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:31.440]   to have that sort of thing.
[00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:34.560]   Plus, I kind of do like the e-paper in some situations.
[00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:38.320]   But I love Amazon.
[00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:39.960]   I never buy music from iTunes.
[00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:42.080]   I've always bought it from Amazon for years now,
[00:14:42.080 --> 00:14:43.840]   because I've been able to do whatever I want
[00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:46.000]   with my music and put it on whatever device that I want.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.120]   And it works perfectly fine with iTunes.
[00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:50.560]   So as a way of perhaps getting people
[00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:53.600]   to start having more music, that's perhaps
[00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:56.600]   sort of a hidden type of thing, as well as the content that's
[00:14:56.600 --> 00:14:58.440]   all involved as well.
[00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:02.440]   I'll just be very curious to see what the Android experience
[00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:06.880]   is like, and if this is going to be a further fragmentation
[00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:09.880]   of it, because it is frustrating when you are, for example,
[00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:11.480]   using a Verizon phone, and you find
[00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:15.560]   that you can't get the right app, because your Verizon phone
[00:15:15.560 --> 00:15:18.000]   isn't supporting 2.2 or whatever.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.440]   And they're up to 2.3 on something else,
[00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:22.680]   and it's just going to be a mess.
[00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:24.240]   I think, Jeff, you hit the nail on the head
[00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:27.040]   when you describe the fact, or Steve Rubell,
[00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:30.880]   that Apple is a hardware company making a hardware device.
[00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:33.160]   And Amazon is a content company.
[00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:35.440]   And there's no GPS in this.
[00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:38.840]   There's no camera in this.
[00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:41.600]   The keyboard is limited.
[00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:43.840]   Actually, it looks a lot in the ad anyway.
[00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:46.280]   It looks a lot like the traditional Android Gingerbread
[00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:47.640]   keyboard.
[00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:51.680]   But this is going to be a superb portal to Amazon.
[00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:52.200]   And Amazon?
[00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:52.920]   As service.
[00:15:52.920 --> 00:15:56.680]   Yeah, I think I see themselves as a service company, too,
[00:15:56.680 --> 00:15:58.560]   with Amazon Web Services.
[00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:00.320]   We'll get to Facebook in a little bit later.
[00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:04.200]   But I think that all you tie this into with Zuckerberg's view
[00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:06.720]   that he's changing the structure of media now,
[00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:08.920]   and that the primary means--
[00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:12.240]   not primary, but a key means of discovery.
[00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:16.840]   And thus distribution won't be brands, or be less so brands,
[00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:18.600]   and less so search--
[00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:23.440]   sorry, Dami-- and more so sharing.
[00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:25.560]   And so the question is-- the interesting thing to me
[00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:27.720]   is you look at Facebook on this.
[00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:30.320]   You look at social things on this, and social sharing.
[00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:32.800]   Amazon is a little bit social.
[00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:33.840]   You can comment on all that.
[00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:35.920]   But I don't have a community at Amazon.
[00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:37.400]   Well, interestingly, we remain to be seen
[00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:40.840]   with how much Facebook we involved in Apple's next announcement.
[00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:42.400]   In fact, it looks like Facebook and Apple
[00:16:42.400 --> 00:16:44.920]   are kind of at odds with one another.
[00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:45.440]   Right.
[00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:47.080]   So that's to me interesting, too, is
[00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:49.920]   that if you go beyond--
[00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:51.920]   the spheres of discovery of media,
[00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:53.600]   it used to be-- it was only brands.
[00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:54.400]   You had to go to the brand.
[00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:55.800]   You had to buy the publication.
[00:16:55.800 --> 00:16:58.160]   You had to go to the store, whatever.
[00:16:58.160 --> 00:16:59.980]   Then it became Search, and then it became
[00:16:59.980 --> 00:17:01.840]   Links through Twitter and Facebook and all that.
[00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:04.920]   Well, that's going to, I think, go nutty here.
[00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:09.920]   And so Search, I mean, social and sharing
[00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:12.600]   will have a big relationship in how you discover and view
[00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:14.640]   things, and then how you view them socially,
[00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:16.520]   how you watch them together and all this stuff.
[00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:18.880]   Makes me wonder if Facebook isn't
[00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:23.120]   considering doing a device that's social-focused.
[00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:25.640]   I mean, wouldn't this be a smart thing for Facebook to do?
[00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:27.520]   Or maybe they should just be talking to you in the--
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:28.640]   Or say in philosophy.
[00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:29.320]   Same philosophy.
[00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:31.640]   Why wouldn't Facebook be--
[00:17:31.640 --> 00:17:34.000]   look at what Google is doing.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:39.760]   The fact that you can do a hangout and watch stuff together,
[00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:40.480]   that's social.
[00:17:40.480 --> 00:17:42.720]   The fact that we now search on a topic,
[00:17:42.720 --> 00:17:45.320]   you can save that and start to gather around that topic
[00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:47.640]   in some ways.
[00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:49.160]   That could just as easily be a game.
[00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:51.280]   No, I wish I could get rid of the game notifications
[00:17:51.280 --> 00:17:53.040]   on Google+, but that's another thing.
[00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:55.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:00.440]   And so I think--
[00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:02.560]   By the way, I think the game notifications are gone,
[00:18:02.560 --> 00:18:03.920]   aren't they from Google+.
[00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:05.640]   I think it went away.
[00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:08.040]   You still get them?
[00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:09.800]   Yeah, I've been getting killed on them too.
[00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:10.760]   I must have done some, right?
[00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:11.440]   Don't play games.
[00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:13.080]   I'm not a fun guy.
[00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:14.080]   OK?
[00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:14.560]   You don't look--
[00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:16.160]   I don't have fun.
[00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:18.560]   I cause mercy.
[00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:21.440]   Actually, Danny, Greg Sterling writing on Search Engine Land
[00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:26.800]   says that the Android Fire tablet is an active audacity
[00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:31.800]   that fums its nose at Google, even while using Google's OS
[00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:32.560]   in the background.
[00:18:32.560 --> 00:18:33.080]   It's true.
[00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:36.160]   Not only didn't mention Google or Android at the talk,
[00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:38.640]   but nowhere on the device does it mention it.
[00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:40.880]   And they even created their own browser.
[00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:41.880]   What's your Google?
[00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:43.080]   What do you think of it?
[00:18:43.080 --> 00:18:43.680]   You think the--
[00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:44.040]   It's great.
[00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:45.840]   You can see their--
[00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:47.360]   Google doesn't mind.
[00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:49.120]   I think Google would love this the next time
[00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:51.080]   to get called in front of some antitrust hearing
[00:18:51.080 --> 00:18:52.520]   in their tool.
[00:18:52.520 --> 00:18:54.400]   You control Android, you do whatever they want.
[00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:55.280]   And they say, well, really?
[00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:57.120]   Because Amazon does whatever it wants with Android.
[00:18:57.120 --> 00:18:59.640]   So what are you talking about?
[00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:03.720]   This is a really good gift for Google in a lot of ways.
[00:19:03.720 --> 00:19:08.040]   Remember also, as far as Google is concerned,
[00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:11.240]   the more people are connected, the more they win.
[00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:14.400]   Because a lot of those people are still going to do searches.
[00:19:14.400 --> 00:19:17.440]   I don't know what the hard wire search is on that browser.
[00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:20.080]   I wouldn't be incredibly surprised if it wasn't tied
[00:19:20.080 --> 00:19:22.040]   into Google simply because that'll
[00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:24.800]   be the perception of a lot of people who use Amazon that I
[00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:26.440]   should just get Google, right?
[00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:28.560]   Amazon doesn't have its own search engine.
[00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:30.440]   So they're going to have to hard wire it somewhere.
[00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:34.320]   If they did cut a deal, which could be entirely possible
[00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:37.600]   with Bing, which is really the only other choice,
[00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:39.640]   people may very well try to change it or go to it
[00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:41.880]   or just go to Google directly if they're there.
[00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:43.720]   Google still has a very solid brand.
[00:19:43.720 --> 00:19:46.120]   Plus, one of the things that Amazon talks about is, hey,
[00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:48.080]   you can get all these copyright free books.
[00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:49.600]   One of the providers of those is Google.
[00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:52.000]   So Google's in the background.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:55.640]   I don't think Google's going, oh, this is a terrible thing.
[00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:57.400]   Anyone Google open sourced the project
[00:19:57.400 --> 00:19:59.440]   when they made the decision to make Android open source,
[00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:00.640]   they wanted this to happen.
[00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:02.360]   I mean, this is always going to an open source project,
[00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:05.360]   hoping that other people are going to use it.
[00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:07.800]   The Kindle Fire, when I first got my Kindle,
[00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:10.280]   it occurred to me that the Kindle felt just as much
[00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:13.960]   as shopping a buying machine as it was a reader.
[00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:15.920]   And the Kindle Fire, I think that this
[00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:20.920]   is going to be the best mobile buying experience out there.
[00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:24.120]   Because Google would check out Conestink sometimes.
[00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:27.080]   It's as annoying as you have to sync and connect
[00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:28.080]   and connect to the other people.
[00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:30.960]   But I mean, it's going to be so easy to buy things
[00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:32.000]   through the Amazon ecosystem.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.160]   And I buy stuff from--
[00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:36.840]   I rent movies and TV and buy all my MB3s like Danny
[00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:37.920]   through Amazon.
[00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:39.320]   I don't do it through iTunes at all.
[00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:41.840]   So I think that's going to be a really good experience.
[00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:44.080]   What Danny said earlier about what
[00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:47.080]   defines the Android experience, to me,
[00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:49.680]   the nook was never really fully Android
[00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:50.920]   because there wasn't an App Store.
[00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:52.760]   To me, the App Store is the difference.
[00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:56.360]   And it doesn't have to be the Google Android market.
[00:20:56.360 --> 00:20:59.440]   The Amazon App Store is a perfectly good App Store.
[00:20:59.440 --> 00:21:02.200]   In fact, I am going to spend a little time updating my app
[00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:04.400]   in the App Store now that I know that it's
[00:21:04.400 --> 00:21:07.560]   going to be in the hands of so many people on this device.
[00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:09.720]   So it's interesting what makes something
[00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:11.160]   an Android device.
[00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:13.640]   And I hope that Amazon's lack of mention of Google
[00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:14.680]   doesn't mean--
[00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:16.840]   I mean, my kind of ideal hippie view
[00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:18.040]   of how open source works.
[00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:20.120]   And my hopes for this is that Amazon and Google
[00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:23.880]   are going to work together to make Android better for everyone.
[00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:25.440]   That would be lovely, yeah.
[00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:26.960]   That's the way open source works, right?
[00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:30.360]   If you're working on the project, then you submit patches back.
[00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:32.480]   And I hope that that's happening or that that's going on.
[00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:33.000]   It's your Amazon.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.440]   It's such a fork, though.
[00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:36.840]   I mean, this thing is not even close.
[00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:39.280]   Yeah, well, we can't even tell what version of Android
[00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:39.880]   it's running on.
[00:21:39.880 --> 00:21:40.600]   There's been dissent.
[00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:44.440]   Some people thought that was clear.
[00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:45.520]   Is it clear?
[00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:48.000]   Ours mistakenly reported that it was 3.1,
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.440]   but it's definitely 2.3.
[00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:50.960]   It's definitely gingerbread.
[00:21:50.960 --> 00:21:53.280]   I saw the gingerbread keyboard with the predictions
[00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:54.520]   and everything, so.
[00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:56.920]   But that doesn't mean you couldn't apply that to some other version.
[00:21:56.920 --> 00:22:00.360]   So you're sure we're sure it's 2.3.
[00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:01.880]   I'm pretty sure.
[00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:02.880]   Yeah, OK.
[00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:05.680]   If you're Amazon, what do you want Google to do?
[00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:06.120]   Look at it.
[00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:08.040]   What's the negotiation like?
[00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:12.320]   Google says we want to hook into your customers for some way.
[00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:14.320]   Amazon says, OK, if.
[00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:15.760]   What's that balance like?
[00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:17.920]   I can't figure it out.
[00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:21.560]   Well, one would hope that they wouldn't share anything at all.
[00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:23.600]   Oh.
[00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:26.720]   This has been-- apparently, this is the rub between Facebook
[00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:29.280]   and Apple, that Facebook wanted customer information
[00:22:29.280 --> 00:22:30.720]   from Apple.
[00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:32.200]   And Apple said, no way.
[00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:33.800]   That's what stopped integration.
[00:22:33.800 --> 00:22:35.520]   Well, I don't think Google wants customer information.
[00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:36.840]   I think what they want is the opportunity
[00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:39.480]   to talk to the customer directly through search
[00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:41.480]   and its own apps, which aren't there.
[00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:42.720]   So how does Google--
[00:22:42.720 --> 00:22:45.600]   Well, I guess you could have AdSense on the web pages
[00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:47.360]   you go to and sell.
[00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:47.800]   Yeah.
[00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:48.320]   Maybe not.
[00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:49.720]   Maybe they'll strip them out.
[00:22:49.720 --> 00:22:50.920]   This is the thing.
[00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:54.480]   Amazon X is a complete intermediate on all web pages.
[00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:56.600]   Well, the difficulty is if Amazon starts going through
[00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:59.600]   and stripping out ads on other people's websites,
[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:02.000]   then they get into issues with people on websites.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.320]   That'll be in court like that.
[00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:04.520]   They can't do that.
[00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:05.200]   All right.
[00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:07.600]   So Google has that much of a presence.
[00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:08.880]   You know, it was very interesting.
[00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:13.520]   It looked like they've got deals with almost every magazine
[00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:14.320]   right out of the box.
[00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:16.720]   And Conde Nast, of course, heavily featured
[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:20.800]   with Vanity Fair and Wired and GQ,
[00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:24.920]   they said that they would have interactive apps, special apps,
[00:23:24.920 --> 00:23:26.600]   with video-- not apps.
[00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:28.680]   I shouldn't even say-- because it's a magazine newsstand.
[00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:30.000]   They're not saying apps.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.080]   It's a magazine newsstand.
[00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:33.800]   But these magazines will have video interactivity
[00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:35.960]   and features they don't put in the print.
[00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:38.280]   Is it HTML5?
[00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:42.640]   So if you're a publisher now, what
[00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:46.720]   do you have to do to get on Apple and Android regular--
[00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:47.680]   That's a very good question.
[00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:49.280]   That's a very good question.
[00:23:49.280 --> 00:23:50.760]   Yeah, what format are these coming in?
[00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:51.560]   So these aren't apps.
[00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:52.600]   These aren't standalone apps.
[00:23:52.600 --> 00:23:53.680]   Well, that's not clear.
[00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:54.080]   Right.
[00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:59.120]   They have a store like a newsstand.
[00:23:59.120 --> 00:24:01.320]   They call it newsstand, I think.
[00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:02.720]   I think the thing that--
[00:24:02.720 --> 00:24:04.960]   this may sound dumb, and I hate to get back to books.
[00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:06.600]   But what concerns me most about it
[00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:08.840]   is I've been playing with the Kindle
[00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:12.160]   and buying more books through it.
[00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:16.560]   My ability to do with these books that I purchased and supposedly
[00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:17.840]   owned are limited.
[00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:18.200]   I don't.
[00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:19.880]   I can't export them.
[00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:23.880]   I can't give them to my kids if they want to read them.
[00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:26.040]   I can't put them onto another device.
[00:24:26.040 --> 00:24:29.880]   I can't put them on any of my devices support Kindle,
[00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:31.360]   but only Kindle.
[00:24:31.360 --> 00:24:34.160]   And I've got an entire bookcase behind me
[00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:36.600]   that is full of books that I've had for decades,
[00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:40.000]   that I've taken and I've shipped them across the ocean
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   twice, the Atlantic climate back and forth coming year.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:46.680]   And now the tablet that they brought out,
[00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:48.880]   I think, is going to further accelerate us all
[00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:52.320]   buying these proprietarily locked up books.
[00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:55.760]   And I don't know what happens down the line.
[00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:57.280]   One of the things I loved about Amazon
[00:24:57.280 --> 00:25:01.000]   was when I bought music, that music was not locked.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.600]   It wasn't-- I was able to get any kind of song I wanted,
[00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:05.960]   it seemed, and I could use it on any device,
[00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:07.360]   and I could take it off if I wanted to.
[00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:09.800]   I bought it.
[00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:12.400]   Apple eventually came and did the same sort of thing,
[00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:13.560]   where if you want to buy the song,
[00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:15.560]   you want it to be un-copyright restricted,
[00:25:15.560 --> 00:25:17.280]   you can do that sort of thing, and you can put it
[00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:18.200]   onto a different device.
[00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:22.720]   But people are building entire libraries of Kindle-based books.
[00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:25.600]   And I feel like part of me is like we're
[00:25:25.600 --> 00:25:28.840]   buying all of our libraries on 8Track,
[00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:32.360]   and I would feel much happier if Amazon gave me
[00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:33.960]   some long-term guidance into what's
[00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:35.880]   going to happen with my books down the line.
[00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:39.680]   I had Steven Levy's book where I took huge numbers of notes,
[00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:42.320]   and I hadn't seen all the notes I've written
[00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:43.960]   and all the things I've highlighted,
[00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:47.840]   because his publisher or Amazon or the both of them
[00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:49.640]   have decided I've highlighted so much that it's
[00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:52.880]   a copyright violation, so they can't display them all, right?
[00:25:52.880 --> 00:25:54.400]   I mean, it's my book.
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:55.800]   They're my highlights.
[00:25:55.800 --> 00:25:58.040]   If I want to review everything I've highlighted in a book
[00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:01.560]   I bought in one go, it's crazy.
[00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:06.040]   So that I feel that's the biggest misgiving I had in all this.
[00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:08.680]   They're daddying at someone's point.
[00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:10.480]   It's a really important point, I think,
[00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:13.200]   is that we're at this point--
[00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:15.600]   besides being the obvious point about-- you're right about books
[00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:19.360]   and it's a holy cause-- but also who's sucking up
[00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:23.080]   to the entertainment industry more, in what ways,
[00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:25.520]   to get more stuff, right?
[00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:29.880]   And I think that the battle for trying to go without DRM
[00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:34.560]   now goes the other way, because if Amazon or Apple or whoever
[00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:39.720]   has a control of us and they can hold back who's
[00:26:39.720 --> 00:26:43.920]   going to get the ability to stream stuff or put stuff up,
[00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:46.560]   we're going to see, I think, the return of more and more DRM.
[00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:51.400]   Wow, that's depressing.
[00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:53.400]   That is depressing to press every week.
[00:26:53.400 --> 00:26:55.240]   See, this is why it all play games.
[00:26:55.240 --> 00:26:56.720]   I'm depressed.
[00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:57.560]   I'm asking it.
[00:26:57.560 --> 00:27:00.320]   It is, but I mean, I don't know if you can see my bookshelf,
[00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:01.880]   but I just clean through it and everything.
[00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:04.000]   And I mean, I've literally moved these books around.
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:05.160]   And I've gone to that point, Noah.
[00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:07.160]   I thought, I can't buy any more books,
[00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:08.360]   not because I can't afford them.
[00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:10.040]   I just don't have the storage.
[00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:10.600]   So I'm very--
[00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:13.280]   So I'm very interested in how they're all the same height.
[00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:15.320]   You do them by size?
[00:27:15.320 --> 00:27:16.600]   Oh, no, they're--
[00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:18.880]   It's very complicated by a favorite author
[00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:19.800]   and group of author.
[00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:20.880]   It's a tiny, don't you?
[00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:25.080]   So the top shelf is all Heinlein and Peter Hamilton.
[00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:27.840]   And then, to get down into some of your alternative history
[00:27:27.840 --> 00:27:30.280]   and further down-- that's just the science fiction bookshelf,
[00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:30.520]   though.
[00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:32.040]   But--
[00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:32.960]   So--
[00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:33.720]   Yeah.
[00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:35.840]   They are my height in the sense that I always buy paperback
[00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:37.560]   simply because I prefer the size.
[00:27:37.560 --> 00:27:39.040]   I don't like holding big hardbacks.
[00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:40.360]   Which is why I love the Kindle so much.
[00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:42.960]   That's why I love getting-- one of the reasons I wanted to nuke
[00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:45.920]   was I wanted a small, light little tablet that I could read
[00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:47.880]   before I'm going to sleep or something like that.
[00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:50.120]   The iPad is like I'm always holding it.
[00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:51.800]   I feel like it's the fall onto my face.
[00:27:51.800 --> 00:27:53.840]   So it was worth it for me to get the Kindle.
[00:27:53.840 --> 00:27:57.720]   But I want a library I know I can depend on in the future.
[00:27:57.720 --> 00:27:59.400]   I think, of course, we care about that.
[00:27:59.400 --> 00:28:01.360]   But I think that the average consumer isn't really
[00:28:01.360 --> 00:28:02.640]   thinking that far down the road.
[00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:05.440]   They just want to read the latest Danielle Steele and--
[00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:06.200]   No?
[00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:07.200]   Well, no, I agree with you.
[00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:08.840]   And I think that's the other thing is I realized
[00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:10.080]   is I went through a lot of these books.
[00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:13.960]   And I thought, gosh, I paid $7 for this paperback.
[00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:15.920]   I'm not going to get anything for it now.
[00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:19.520]   And in the past, I used to save it because I just--
[00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:21.480]   it was really weird for me to throw away books
[00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:22.760]   and get rid of books.
[00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:24.000]   And now I'm going through books.
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:26.080]   And if I do buy the paperback, unless it's an author,
[00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:26.760]   I really love.
[00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:29.040]   It's like, OK, that book's going to get donated or something.
[00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:31.560]   So that's part of my older mindset, which
[00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:36.560]   was books are something you hadn't held forever to go away.
[00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:38.120]   And that's the same sort of thing with music
[00:28:38.120 --> 00:28:39.520]   that I'm kind of going through.
[00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:40.720]   I think it was Spotify, right?
[00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:42.200]   You bought the song, you owned it.
[00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:43.520]   And then you just thought, Spotify,
[00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:46.120]   you're like, why do I need to buy that music again?
[00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:48.760]   I mean, aside from the times when I'm roller-weighting,
[00:28:48.760 --> 00:28:50.360]   I'm not going to have a good connection.
[00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:51.400]   I'm not going to download it.
[00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:55.360]   And I haven't configured it to be offline or whatever it is.
[00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:56.840]   For the most part, I can get songs
[00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:58.840]   without having to just actually own them.
[00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:02.560]   So maybe that's them damn kids.
[00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:03.800]   They're going to have a whole new world.
[00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:04.680]   Cultures changing.
[00:29:04.680 --> 00:29:05.520]   Cultures changing.
[00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:07.600]   And definitely think these attitudes are changing.
[00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:09.760]   Like my attitude about books has definitely changed over the years.
[00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:11.920]   I used to feel the same way that I wanted my favorite books
[00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:14.480]   in a shelf, in my office, and my identity.
[00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:15.520]   It was kind of tied to that.
[00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:17.560]   I wanted people to come into my office to see my books
[00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:19.440]   and kind of know what I was about.
[00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:22.680]   But with the Kindle, I buy and I read a lot more.
[00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:25.400]   And I treated a little more just like, hey,
[00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:26.360]   I'm reading this thing.
[00:29:26.360 --> 00:29:27.120]   And I had these highlights.
[00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:29.600]   I love the highlights and notes, although that story,
[00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:32.600]   Danny, about you being told that you highlighted too much
[00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:34.600]   copyright violation, that is horrible.
[00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:35.760]   I've never run up against that.
[00:29:35.760 --> 00:29:37.720]   That's horrible.
[00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:39.120]   But my attitude has definitely changed.
[00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:40.920]   I mean, if I love a book and I want,
[00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:42.720]   or if I go to a signing and author signing,
[00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:44.440]   I'll buy it and put that in my shelf.
[00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:47.840]   But otherwise, I kind of treat them more just like magazines,
[00:29:47.840 --> 00:29:49.360]   which I don't know if that's a good or bad thing.
[00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:51.040]   I just think it's a different thing.
[00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:53.960]   I do remember saying years ago, oh, I'll never read an e-book.
[00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:55.680]   Nobody will ever want e-books.
[00:29:55.680 --> 00:29:57.000]   And I think even at the time, I said,
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.200]   my kids might be different.
[00:29:58.200 --> 00:30:00.000]   Well, it's happened really faster than we thought it is.
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   It's us.
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:03.480]   It didn't take that long.
[00:30:03.480 --> 00:30:07.640]   Well, what it also says is that with borders gone,
[00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:11.080]   the role of the publisher is, you know,
[00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:14.200]   I went to work for Advance, which is kind of in asked,
[00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:15.400]   they are still on Random House.
[00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:16.240]   I got all excited.
[00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:18.120]   I was going to work with a book publisher, Random House.
[00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:20.520]   My boss, Steve Newhouse, said, don't get so excited.
[00:30:20.520 --> 00:30:22.680]   It's a distribution business.
[00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:24.320]   We don't have a relationship with readers.
[00:30:24.320 --> 00:30:25.400]   Our publisher's authors were just
[00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:26.760]   the middle man in distribution.
[00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:28.320]   You're romantic.
[00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:29.480]   I know.
[00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:31.520]   And so, you know, I just went through my publishing.
[00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:32.440]   I won't plug the book again.
[00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:34.320]   But my editor gave me great service.
[00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:35.320]   And it's surf.
[00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:38.200]   I remember Bennett's surf.
[00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:40.040]   What's the rest, really?
[00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:41.240]   So you look at Amazon.
[00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:43.040]   But the funny thing is, we still keep on looking at things.
[00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:45.920]   I wrote this 5,000 word piece on Gutenberg
[00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:48.760]   as the original technology entrepreneur.
[00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:50.160]   And I wanted to sell it.
[00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:52.280]   I sold a version of it to Wired Germany.
[00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:52.960]   They asked for it.
[00:30:52.960 --> 00:30:54.320]   I wanted to sell it to a magazine.
[00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:55.280]   Couldn't find a buyer here.
[00:30:55.280 --> 00:30:56.240]   So I pumped it up.
[00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:58.040]   I was going to do a Kindle single.
[00:30:58.040 --> 00:30:59.440]   I'm telling the tale out of school here.
[00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:01.800]   But my publisher, an agent, got all nervous.
[00:31:01.800 --> 00:31:03.280]   And Amazon did too.
[00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:04.680]   You shouldn't have that up at the same time
[00:31:04.680 --> 00:31:05.160]   if you have a book done.
[00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:06.040]   Really?
[00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:07.480]   I said, well, yeah, I should.
[00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:08.320]   It's going to promote the book.
[00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:11.640]   It's a disaggregated magazine article is all it is.
[00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:13.160]   No, people will come in and they'll buy it
[00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:16.000]   and study your book because I think they get the cheap version.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   Wow.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   Wow.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.160]   Yeah, right.
[00:31:19.160 --> 00:31:21.200]   So, you know, I'm going to put it up for free,
[00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:22.520]   eventually, probably from CUNY.
[00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:23.120]   And that's fine.
[00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:24.160]   I was going to make any money on it.
[00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:26.240]   I was just going to-- I wanted to learn about Kindle singles.
[00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:27.760]   I wanted to do a Kindle single.
[00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:29.440]   And everybody, including Amazon, is a--
[00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:31.440]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:33.400]   Wow.
[00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:34.600]   Interesting.
[00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:35.080]   Same thing.
[00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:35.880]   It's a little ironic.
[00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:36.400]   It's a chat.
[00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:37.400]   Read it.
[00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:39.680]   As the chat room does, that we're talking about books
[00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:42.880]   and reading them on a device named Fire.
[00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:43.880]   Oh, oh.
[00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:44.880]   Oh.
[00:31:44.880 --> 00:31:45.880]   Oh.
[00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:46.880]   I'll make the books.
[00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:49.360]   Oh, price to $4.51 each.
[00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:50.360]   Oh.
[00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:50.860]   Oh.
[00:31:50.860 --> 00:31:52.640]   That's a pad moment, isn't it?
[00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:54.400]   A little Ray Bradbury reference in there.
[00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:55.960]   You are a science fiction fan.
[00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:56.480]   Yeah.
[00:31:56.480 --> 00:31:58.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:31:58.480 --> 00:32:00.200]   Figure this chat room of all rooms.
[00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:01.640]   We'll figure find that out.
[00:32:01.640 --> 00:32:02.480]   Yeah, I like that.
[00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:04.520]   I like the irony of that.
[00:32:04.520 --> 00:32:05.920]   I don't know if that's irony.
[00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:08.520]   I don't-- I'm confused about what irony is.
[00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:09.240]   Let's take a break.
[00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:09.800]   We're going to come back.
[00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:11.200]   There is so much more to talk about.
[00:32:11.200 --> 00:32:13.000]   We haven't talked about the Facebook changes.
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.680]   The stuff rolled out at F-Fate.
[00:32:14.680 --> 00:32:20.680]   We haven't talked about the fact that Google+ had a 1,269%
[00:32:20.680 --> 00:32:22.880]   increase in use last week.
[00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:29.040]   Oh, and the fact that Spotify now requires Facebook
[00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:32.320]   to sign in, to have an account if you're new.
[00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:33.400]   Lots more to talk about.
[00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:34.640]   Before we do that, though, I would
[00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:38.040]   like to talk about a new advertiser on the show.
[00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:39.480]   We always like to welcome new advertisers.
[00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:40.480]   Yay.
[00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:41.280]   Yay.
[00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:42.160]   I've talked about that.
[00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:44.680]   Have I talked about Vast Conference before?
[00:32:44.680 --> 00:32:50.200]   Conference call services from vastconference.com.
[00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:53.040]   You know, I got to log into my account here real quickly.
[00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:54.840]   And I'll show you one of the cool things that happens
[00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:59.400]   when you have a vast conference is you can name the conferees.
[00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:00.680]   I'll go to my dashboard.
[00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:02.360]   I just had a conference call.
[00:33:02.360 --> 00:33:03.280]   So here's the dashboard.
[00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:05.160]   You get-- here's usage and so forth.
[00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:06.280]   We just signed up.
[00:33:06.280 --> 00:33:07.720]   You can see what your calls were.
[00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:09.800]   Here's a conference I had.
[00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:11.520]   And I'll go to the detail here.
[00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:14.320]   I can actually see who was in the conference call, how much
[00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:16.680]   time their connect time, their disconnect time.
[00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:20.360]   I can actually listen to back to them.
[00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:22.000]   We've got recordings.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:26.160]   This is the kind of detail that you would love to have
[00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:27.800]   on your conference calls.
[00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:29.520]   Vast conference makes it easy.
[00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:31.360]   You only pay by the minute.
[00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:34.800]   So it's very affordable, very straightforward.
[00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:36.200]   Vast will support up to--
[00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:37.280]   this was a small conference.
[00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:39.080]   You can have up to 300 callers at once.
[00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:42.080]   You'll get a regular dial in number as well as a toll free
[00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:43.560]   number.
[00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:46.120]   They're using fiber optic lines and high end teleconferencing
[00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:46.620]   equipment.
[00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:50.040]   So you get a very high quality, better than VoIP quality.
[00:33:50.040 --> 00:33:52.040]   And their conference call management interface
[00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:54.040]   that you're looking at right now really is fantastic.
[00:33:54.040 --> 00:33:55.640]   You can manage users and callers.
[00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:57.680]   You can have question and answer sessions.
[00:33:57.680 --> 00:34:00.080]   You, of course, can recall as MP3s,
[00:34:00.080 --> 00:34:03.440]   lots of detail about usage and billing codes.
[00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:06.040]   They've got a great customer service team.
[00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:07.040]   Really great.
[00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:08.440]   I highly recommend them.
[00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:11.160]   And the pricing is very affordable for a regular call
[00:34:11.160 --> 00:34:12.280]   to a number.
[00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:15.320]   And nowadays with everybody having unlimited calling,
[00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:16.120]   that's not a big deal.
[00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:17.880]   2 and 1/2 cents a minute.
[00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:20.080]   6 cents if you want to use an 800 number call.
[00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:23.320]   And you decide whether you use 800 or toll free.
[00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:24.800]   By the way, by participant.
[00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:28.960]   So if it's your client, you give them the 800 number
[00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:30.880]   or a prospect, you give me the 800 number,
[00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:33.560]   then everybody you work with, you give them the regular number.
[00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:34.160]   Very easy.
[00:34:34.160 --> 00:34:35.560]   There's no commitment, no contract.
[00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:37.800]   You pay only for calls you host.
[00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:39.160]   And we have a deal for you.
[00:34:39.160 --> 00:34:40.480]   You can get up to 300 minutes.
[00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:46.800]   Two business calls free, 300 minutes of calling free
[00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:49.720]   at vastconference.com.
[00:34:49.720 --> 00:34:51.560]   Use the promo code TWIG.
[00:34:51.560 --> 00:34:52.800]   So this is even better.
[00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:54.360]   You can try it yourself.
[00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:57.720]   300 minutes free, vastconference.call.
[00:34:57.720 --> 00:35:00.400]   Use the offer code TWIG.
[00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:01.800]   I just love the interface.
[00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:03.080]   I love how it works.
[00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:06.200]   This is a conference calling in the modern times,
[00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:07.400]   the modern world.
[00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:11.040]   Fastconference.com.
[00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:12.880]   Somebody's saying you should do a conference call
[00:35:12.880 --> 00:35:14.000]   with everybody in the chat room.
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:19.440]   I keep planning to do a hangout somehow.
[00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:20.440]   Yeah, we got to do it.
[00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:21.360]   Broadcast hangouts.
[00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:24.880]   And I just haven't gotten around to doing it.
[00:35:24.880 --> 00:35:27.080]   So Google's upset.
[00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:28.280]   I'm upset.
[00:35:28.280 --> 00:35:31.400]   Microsoft made a deal with Samsung.
[00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:34.040]   Cross-licensing agreement.
[00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:36.680]   With all these lawsuits, I don't blame Samsung for saying,
[00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:38.360]   let's just-- we still got to deal with Apple.
[00:35:38.360 --> 00:35:40.520]   Let's just get out of this with Microsoft.
[00:35:40.520 --> 00:35:44.160]   But Google says, quote, this is the same tactic.
[00:35:44.160 --> 00:35:47.000]   We've seen time and time again from Microsoft
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:50.360]   failing to succeed in the smartphone market.
[00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:51.880]   They're resorting to legal measures
[00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:54.440]   to extort profit from others' achievements
[00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:56.680]   and hinder the pace of innovation.
[00:35:56.680 --> 00:35:58.960]   We remain focused on building new technology
[00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:03.160]   and supporting Android partners.
[00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:05.160]   Hey, Senate, go after Microsoft again.
[00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:05.960]   No kidding.
[00:36:05.960 --> 00:36:07.160]   Don't bother us anymore.
[00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:08.480]   Look what they're doing.
[00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:13.320]   Look what they're-- Mommy, Microsoft's starting me.
[00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:14.680]   Actually, doesn't Microsoft already
[00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:19.480]   get something like $5 for every Android phone sold?
[00:36:19.480 --> 00:36:20.120]   Like, sure.
[00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:21.160]   That much?
[00:36:21.160 --> 00:36:23.600]   I think it was a lot of money.
[00:36:23.600 --> 00:36:26.400]   So now they got to deal some sort of cross-licensing
[00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:29.440]   agreement in which they'll get paid, I presume,
[00:36:29.440 --> 00:36:33.080]   for every Samsung phone sold.
[00:36:33.080 --> 00:36:34.720]   So instead of Google pen-paying them,
[00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:37.040]   then Samsung has to pay them.
[00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:38.040]   They--
[00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:39.880]   Listen to Microsoft, not to Amazon.
[00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:43.280]   Not to Apple that's still up to Amazon.
[00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:43.960]   Does Amazon--
[00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:43.960]   Amazon--
[00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:47.240]   Amazon Android developers, Acer, General Dynamics,
[00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:50.120]   I-Tronics, Ankyo, Velocity Micro, ViewSonic,
[00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:52.520]   and Whistern, all of whom pay money to Microsoft
[00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:55.080]   whenever they sell a product with Android on it.
[00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:58.160]   Does Amazon need to?
[00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:00.520]   Well, Microsoft hasn't sued them yet.
[00:37:00.520 --> 00:37:02.520]   But I mean, you know, is the same stuff there?
[00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:05.680]   What's the basis of the patent?
[00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:06.680]   What's--
[00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:07.760]   I'm going to try to get to--
[00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:09.200]   did Amazon cut that stuff out?
[00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:14.560]   I don't know.
[00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:15.520]   Interesting question.
[00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:21.560]   HTC, too, by the way.
[00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:25.400]   So every time an HTC phone is sold, I was told,
[00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:26.840]   it's $5 to Microsoft.
[00:37:26.840 --> 00:37:28.880]   I presume it's something like that now.
[00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:31.400]   Microsoft doesn't even need to have a successful phone.
[00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:32.400]   They make money--
[00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:32.920]   Yeah, that's fine.
[00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:34.880]   Did you all sign the petition, the White House petition,
[00:37:34.880 --> 00:37:35.320]   to--
[00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:36.320]   Yes.
[00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:36.320]   And--
[00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:36.820]   Yes.
[00:37:36.820 --> 00:37:37.600]   --software patents.
[00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:39.320]   And as long as I was there, I signed the one
[00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:41.520]   about legalizing weed.
[00:37:41.520 --> 00:37:43.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:45.160]   Is your California?
[00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:45.840]   No, I didn't.
[00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:47.520]   But I thought it was very interesting
[00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:50.720]   that that's the number one petition on the White House.gov
[00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:51.720]   site.
[00:37:51.720 --> 00:37:55.560]   And the petition to do software patents actually
[00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:56.960]   is doing pretty well.
[00:37:56.960 --> 00:37:57.480]   Yeah.
[00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:59.360]   Doing pretty well.
[00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:02.760]   You know, it had a patent on selling weed, then I think
[00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:06.360]   you would find that there would be more support
[00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:07.520]   on the patent thing.
[00:38:07.520 --> 00:38:10.040]   You joke, but I would come to the DRAM.
[00:38:10.040 --> 00:38:13.320]   As soon as marijuana is as soon as it's legal,
[00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:14.640]   that's the very first thing people do,
[00:38:14.640 --> 00:38:16.840]   is they patent various hybridizations.
[00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:19.120]   I guarantee you.
[00:38:19.120 --> 00:38:24.120]   And then let the war begin.
[00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:25.640]   Jeez.
[00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:27.720]   Happy birthday, Mazel Tov.
[00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:31.080]   To Google, 13 years now you are a man.
[00:38:31.080 --> 00:38:32.760]   And you saw--
[00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:36.320]   I kept-- after all of these elaborate Google doodles
[00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:38.320]   with Freddie Mercury, I kept clicking this thing,
[00:38:38.320 --> 00:38:39.520]   hoping something would happen.
[00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:40.880]   Right, that's something would happen, right?
[00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:43.120]   Jim Henson, they got a Muppets eating Muppets.
[00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:45.440]   They got a stuff-- nothing.
[00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:46.360]   Was it just me?
[00:38:46.360 --> 00:38:47.840]   Yeah.
[00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:51.880]   I mean, they do have other things where they don't go nuts
[00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:52.640]   on all this stuff.
[00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:54.120]   So maybe they were tired.
[00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:54.640]   They're busy.
[00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:56.400]   Maybe it was like, hey, it's our birthday tomorrow.
[00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:57.200]   We better do a logo.
[00:38:57.200 --> 00:38:58.520]   OK, whatever you've got.
[00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:00.000]   I mean, there's 13.
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.080]   There's 12.
[00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:03.800]   And if they did do a big, huge thing,
[00:39:03.800 --> 00:39:05.880]   then you probably would have had people saying, oh, Google,
[00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:08.200]   doing a big, big thing for your own birthday.
[00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:08.680]   Great.
[00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:10.160]   What about Martin Luther King?
[00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:10.840]   Yeah.
[00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:12.680]   So I don't know.
[00:39:12.680 --> 00:39:13.160]   Yeah.
[00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:14.320]   I kind of like that it was understated.
[00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:17.240]   I'm sure that 15-1 will be pretty big.
[00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:21.120]   There's some debate over how old Google is.
[00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:24.560]   September 14th, September 27th.
[00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:25.040]   It looks like--
[00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:27.080]   September 7th, yeah.
[00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:29.640]   So what happened was-- and I did a--
[00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:31.240]   it's linked to off of our article on Search
[00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:32.200]   and Showing on the 13th.
[00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:34.200]   But it was like, when is the Google birthday?
[00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:37.160]   And they're kind of like the Queen of England
[00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:40.400]   where she has an official birthday and then her real birthday.
[00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:42.800]   And the official-- what's that?
[00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:44.040]   I'm just laughing.
[00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:46.720]   Yeah, so her official birthday is this public holiday.
[00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:48.840]   And no matter who's the queen or the king,
[00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:51.640]   that will always be the king or queen's birthday.
[00:39:51.640 --> 00:39:53.360]   And then when they're actually born,
[00:39:53.360 --> 00:39:55.040]   they got a whole other thing that's happening.
[00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:57.840]   So they incorporated September 7th, 1998.
[00:39:57.840 --> 00:39:58.200]   Right.
[00:39:58.200 --> 00:39:59.880]   And that's what they used to celebrate.
[00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:01.400]   And they did that for a long time.
[00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:03.720]   And then there was this thing around 2005
[00:40:03.720 --> 00:40:07.600]   when Yahoo had announced that they had a bigger index than Google.
[00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:11.480]   And Google went crazy and got really, really upset about that.
[00:40:11.480 --> 00:40:13.520]   And there was like a month of back and forth.
[00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:16.360]   And in the end-- and old timers will remember this.
[00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:17.520]   You used to do a search on Google.
[00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:19.160]   And on the home page, you told you
[00:40:19.160 --> 00:40:20.800]   how many pages you were searching through.
[00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:22.760]   Kind of like going to McDonald's, billions and billions
[00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:23.640]   served.
[00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:24.140]   Right.
[00:40:24.140 --> 00:40:27.580]   And they dropped that number as part of a post that they did,
[00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:30.260]   saying, hey, we're seven years old today.
[00:40:30.260 --> 00:40:33.040]   And since we're growing up, we don't think we should have
[00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:34.640]   to talk about numbers anymore.
[00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:36.140]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:40:36.140 --> 00:40:38.900]   And they all did this in conjunction with it suddenly
[00:40:38.900 --> 00:40:40.620]   the 27th being their birthday.
[00:40:40.620 --> 00:40:42.020]   And they've held to that ever since.
[00:40:42.020 --> 00:40:44.940]   But it was-- I remember very much being tied into it.
[00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:47.260]   We need an excuse to kind of make it seem like we're
[00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:49.500]   dropping this number so we don't have to have this fight with Yahoo
[00:40:49.500 --> 00:40:50.520]   anymore.
[00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:53.160]   And we're tucking into our birthday celebrations.
[00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:55.220]   That's bizarre because, I mean, really, there is nothing
[00:40:55.220 --> 00:41:00.140]   that happened as far as we know on September 27, 1998.
[00:41:00.140 --> 00:41:01.740]   Avril was born, right?
[00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:03.220]   Singer?
[00:41:03.220 --> 00:41:04.420]   Yeah, I saw that on Twitter.
[00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:05.020]   But I'm like--
[00:41:05.020 --> 00:41:09.340]   So they registered Google.com on September 15, '97.
[00:41:09.340 --> 00:41:13.580]   They incorporated, we think, September 7, '98.
[00:41:13.580 --> 00:41:15.980]   That's just-- and in fact, at the Google Zeitgeist
[00:41:15.980 --> 00:41:18.700]   Conference that they had yesterday, Larry Page, when he
[00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:22.540]   was talking, he said, hey, we're 13 today, although, you know,
[00:41:22.540 --> 00:41:24.240]   that's kind of debated ourselves.
[00:41:24.240 --> 00:41:25.000]   So--
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:25.760]   Wow.
[00:41:25.760 --> 00:41:28.440]   So that's the date they're going with now.
[00:41:28.440 --> 00:41:31.280]   And unless they get bunted for drinking under age,
[00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:35.040]   it probably doesn't matter.
[00:41:35.040 --> 00:41:36.880]   How was Zeitgeist, by the way?
[00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:39.680]   What was your-- what were the takeaways from Zeitgeist?
[00:41:39.680 --> 00:41:43.400]   Well, it's similar to a TED event,
[00:41:43.400 --> 00:41:47.640]   or where you get a lot of inspirational speakers that
[00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:50.520]   are trying to tell you how the world should be changed better.
[00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:54.900]   And Cory Booker from New Jersey was there from Newark.
[00:41:54.900 --> 00:41:56.860]   And he was incredibly inspirational.
[00:41:56.860 --> 00:41:58.640]   There was any number of inspirational speakers
[00:41:58.640 --> 00:42:02.100]   to the point where I just kind of felt like I needed a panel
[00:42:02.100 --> 00:42:04.900]   on why, when everybody seemed to know the answer to everything,
[00:42:04.900 --> 00:42:06.620]   do we still not follow those answers?
[00:42:06.620 --> 00:42:07.620]   Right?
[00:42:07.620 --> 00:42:08.420]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:42:08.420 --> 00:42:10.140]   Any more solutions at this point?
[00:42:10.140 --> 00:42:12.300]   I just-- you just like, why do we not listen to this stuff?
[00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:14.300]   It's the old George Burns line.
[00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:16.900]   He says, why is it everybody who knows how to run this country
[00:42:16.900 --> 00:42:18.940]   is working in a barbershop or a taxi cab?
[00:42:18.940 --> 00:42:20.340]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:42:20.340 --> 00:42:22.320]   How come everybody knows how to solve our problems
[00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:24.480]   of speaking at TED conferences?
[00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:25.360]   That's exactly.
[00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:29.760]   They had a fascinating panel with Ariana Huffington
[00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:35.760]   and Ted Koppel, where Koppel was borderline grumpy old man,
[00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:36.420]   right?
[00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:38.520]   Like, social media.
[00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:40.280]   And yet, he just kept scoring.
[00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:44.320]   I felt point after point against her on, you know what?
[00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:47.360]   Journalism isn't just going to go make itself.
[00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:50.160]   She's like talking about, well, we have all the reports.
[00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:51.040]   We have all the things.
[00:42:51.040 --> 00:42:52.300]   It's all going to be great.
[00:42:52.300 --> 00:42:53.720]   He's like, how many foreign correspondents
[00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:55.820]   is the Huffington Post run?
[00:42:55.820 --> 00:42:59.240]   And she's like, well, we have some people in Canada and the UK.
[00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:04.480]   And he really was this old school journalist who
[00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:07.280]   didn't quite sound like the typical old school journalist who
[00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:10.240]   I think sometimes tried to look for excuses.
[00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:12.340]   I mean, he just really felt concerned about the fact
[00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:16.280]   that there needs to be more regional reporting of things
[00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:17.040]   that people care about.
[00:43:17.040 --> 00:43:19.080]   And he was equally harsh on the mainstream media
[00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:25.800]   going after stories that they think people want rather than
[00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:26.760]   they need.
[00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:28.160]   So that resonated with me.
[00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:30.920]   But in terms of Google stuff, Larry Page at the end,
[00:43:30.920 --> 00:43:32.200]   this is probably a big deal for him.
[00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:34.000]   Who live vlogged this event?
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:35.160]   Yeah.
[00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:38.280]   He did this wrap up at the end where--
[00:43:38.280 --> 00:43:40.000]   I think this is the first time he's spoken.
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:41.680]   It's like, guys, I've only been to it twice.
[00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:44.280]   They've been running them for at least seven years.
[00:43:44.280 --> 00:43:47.040]   But I'm pretty sure Eric Schmidt has always done the closing,
[00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:48.960]   hey, you know, you've been hearing
[00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:50.640]   all this stuff that doesn't really have to do with us.
[00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:52.400]   Now let's talk about us for a bit.
[00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:56.800]   And he talked many, many times about how excited he was
[00:43:56.800 --> 00:43:58.440]   about Google+, although he didn't really
[00:43:58.440 --> 00:44:01.360]   get into any specifics of what it was supposed to do other
[00:44:01.360 --> 00:44:03.760]   than greater sharing, greater social, greater
[00:44:03.760 --> 00:44:04.440]   knowledge.
[00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:05.880]   You know, we know it.
[00:44:05.880 --> 00:44:07.960]   Perhaps one of the highlights was really at the end of it
[00:44:07.960 --> 00:44:10.440]   when somebody had said to him, what do you think
[00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:13.120]   is the big threat to Google?
[00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:16.760]   And he took the mic and he said really loudly, Google.
[00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:18.160]   And it was that Google--
[00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:19.680]   It was the biggest threat to Google?
[00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:20.200]   Yeah.
[00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:22.680]   And the point was that if they can't
[00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:24.320]   learn how to manage themselves and not
[00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:26.760]   let their own internal processes keep them
[00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:29.200]   from being developed or going off with stuff,
[00:44:29.200 --> 00:44:30.400]   that that's a little slow down.
[00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:32.600]   He had one quote where he said something like,
[00:44:32.600 --> 00:44:36.120]   there are no big companies that have successful, slow
[00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:38.680]   decisions or something like that.
[00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:40.640]   In other words, if you're sitting around
[00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:42.600]   trying to figure out every single thing
[00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:44.080]   and you think you've got to write,
[00:44:44.080 --> 00:44:45.360]   you're making a mistake.
[00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:47.280]   You need to make your decisions quickly
[00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:49.680]   and keep moving forward and keep learning and iterating
[00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:50.040]   from that.
[00:44:50.040 --> 00:44:51.880]   So that was really interesting.
[00:44:51.880 --> 00:44:55.120]   That was when you really felt like you were kind of--
[00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:57.640]   Larry was finally loosening up when you were kind of hearing
[00:44:57.640 --> 00:45:01.600]   some things about what it is he's been doing in the past six
[00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:03.760]   months or so that he's actually been CEO and trying
[00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:06.040]   to revitalize the company and get them organized.
[00:45:06.040 --> 00:45:07.720]   And goodness knows they had it.
[00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:10.320]   No lack of action going on there.
[00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:10.800]   Here's--
[00:45:10.800 --> 00:45:12.640]   And the stories I've seen Danny, I think, from you
[00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:15.480]   and elsewhere was that it seems that Larry and Eric's
[00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:17.080]   rapport is as good as ever.
[00:45:17.080 --> 00:45:17.580]   Let's see.
[00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:17.960]   Let's see.
[00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:18.960]   I got a little video here.
[00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:19.920]   Let's make the world better.
[00:45:19.920 --> 00:45:20.480]   Here is--
[00:45:20.480 --> 00:45:21.720]   That's why I'm here.
[00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:22.640]   Here's Larry.
[00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:23.840]   Why love technology?
[00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:25.480]   Why love my job here at Google?
[00:45:25.480 --> 00:45:26.120]   Oh, he's not--
[00:45:26.120 --> 00:45:27.240]   Thank you.
[00:45:27.240 --> 00:45:28.400]   He has no Steve Jobs.
[00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:30.400]   Yeah.
[00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:31.640]   And now he's introducing--
[00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:37.400]   He isn't as an easy-- he's very nerdy.
[00:45:37.400 --> 00:45:37.880]   That's Eric.
[00:45:37.880 --> 00:45:38.380]   Yeah.
[00:45:38.380 --> 00:45:39.280]   It's done well for you.
[00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:44.320]   Now I've asked Eric to join me because he knows
[00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:46.480]   how to answer the really hard questions.
[00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:47.320]   He's so mild man.
[00:45:47.320 --> 00:45:49.520]   He reminds me of Sheldon in the big bang theory.
[00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:50.360]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:45:50.360 --> 00:45:54.600]   I thought first, I think, for everybody here.
[00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:56.200]   I really appreciate you all spending--
[00:45:56.200 --> 00:45:57.440]   Here's the adult supervision.
[00:45:57.440 --> 00:45:58.200]   It really is.
[00:45:58.200 --> 00:45:59.520]   That's how you characterize it, Danny.
[00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:00.120]   I think you're right.
[00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:01.440]   But one of the sessions--
[00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:01.880]   Yeah.
[00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:03.160]   There were so many that I've enjoyed.
[00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:05.160]   And I think feedback from you is consistent.
[00:46:05.160 --> 00:46:06.920]   I know Larry, you feel the same way.
[00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:09.040]   I thought I would read while you're getting your thoughts
[00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:11.200]   together and you've voiced that.
[00:46:11.200 --> 00:46:14.760]   A quote from Cory Booker yesterday morning.
[00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:17.080]   "But yet we as Americans who drink deeply
[00:46:17.080 --> 00:46:20.400]   from the wells of freedom and liberty that we did not dig,
[00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:23.600]   we lavishly eat from the banquet tables that were prepared
[00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:25.840]   for us by our ancestors.
[00:46:25.840 --> 00:46:28.400]   We are too often just sitting around getting drunk
[00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:31.600]   on the sacrifice and struggle of other people's labors
[00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:33.680]   and forgetting that we're part of a noble mission
[00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:35.040]   in humanity.
[00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:38.680]   The First Nation formed not as a monarchy, not as a theocracy,
[00:46:38.680 --> 00:46:42.440]   but as an experiment, an idea that a diverse group of people
[00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:45.360]   that when we come together, Eplerobus Unum,
[00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:48.400]   that we can make a greater whole out of the sum of the parts.
[00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:51.960]   This almost feels like a company meeting, not a public event.
[00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:55.120]   And this is the only part where it became that way.
[00:46:55.120 --> 00:46:58.840]   I mean, that's what's unique about this, or smart, if you will,
[00:46:58.840 --> 00:47:01.240]   is that they've brought in all these advertisers
[00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:02.160]   and big partners.
[00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:04.960]   And this has not been cheerleading.
[00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:06.520]   And hey, here's the Google products here.
[00:47:06.520 --> 00:47:07.560]   Here's the Google thing there.
[00:47:07.560 --> 00:47:08.800]   There are some subtle mentions.
[00:47:08.800 --> 00:47:12.040]   And most of the time, the people that are talking
[00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:13.840]   will have a nice thing to say about Google
[00:47:13.840 --> 00:47:15.640]   or there's been something that's been about with Google.
[00:47:15.640 --> 00:47:16.680]   Well, now it always.
[00:47:16.680 --> 00:47:20.280]   Sometimes people have put some criticisms about Google as well.
[00:47:20.280 --> 00:47:23.920]   But you want to pump up your partners, make them feel special.
[00:47:23.920 --> 00:47:27.000]   You have them come to a thing where on a panel,
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:30.280]   you've got somebody like Tony Hawk or Cory Booker talking
[00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:32.640]   to them and mingling with them and meeting with them.
[00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:35.200]   That makes them feel special.
[00:47:35.200 --> 00:47:38.400]   And this was the wrap up where you do get that kind of company
[00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:40.200]   line where--
[00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:41.720]   And even then, it was really subtle.
[00:47:41.720 --> 00:47:43.160]   There was no like--
[00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:44.800]   that was going to bring out the PowerPoint
[00:47:44.800 --> 00:47:46.280]   and show you where our projections are.
[00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:48.240]   And this is how you're going to do better with AdWords
[00:47:48.240 --> 00:47:51.200]   and we're rocking your world with Android and Segrids
[00:47:51.200 --> 00:47:52.840]   and stuff.
[00:47:52.840 --> 00:47:55.440]   And in terms of the dynamic, towards the end,
[00:47:55.440 --> 00:47:57.880]   when you get past Eric kind of stepping in at that point
[00:47:57.880 --> 00:47:59.400]   and then they start having this dialogue,
[00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:03.280]   one of the most fascinating parts was when Larry got asked
[00:48:03.280 --> 00:48:07.120]   about are things harder now or when they harder then?
[00:48:07.120 --> 00:48:09.480]   And he was sort of like, I think, oh, you know,
[00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:11.680]   OK, it can seem harder now.
[00:48:11.680 --> 00:48:14.360]   And then Eric's like, but Larry, what about that thing
[00:48:14.360 --> 00:48:16.160]   when we almost ran out of money?
[00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:18.400]   He's like, oh, you know, remember?
[00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:19.880]   Like, we almost didn't have money.
[00:48:19.880 --> 00:48:21.440]   Remember, we were running out of it?
[00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:27.240]   We had all of it like the creative reduction program
[00:48:27.240 --> 00:48:30.080]   or crap, is what he said, where we didn't pay our bills
[00:48:30.080 --> 00:48:30.960]   for a while.
[00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:31.520]   Remember?
[00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:36.760]   And then finally, I was going, oh, yeah, it was harder then.
[00:48:36.760 --> 00:48:38.360]   It was hard then, too.
[00:48:38.360 --> 00:48:38.960]   Yeah.
[00:48:38.960 --> 00:48:41.560]   But it was sort of like, oh, you just like, OK.
[00:48:41.560 --> 00:48:43.760]   I mean, they clearly left each other and everything.
[00:48:43.760 --> 00:48:46.600]   But it was very polished.
[00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:47.960]   And you could just see he's kind of wanting
[00:48:47.960 --> 00:48:48.840]   to get into the jokes.
[00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:51.200]   And as sometimes Larry was sort of like,
[00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:52.960]   I'm just talking because I need to be talking.
[00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:55.160]   And other times he loosened up and he would say things
[00:48:55.160 --> 00:48:56.600]   and he'd give you a lap.
[00:48:56.600 --> 00:48:59.480]   And you really, you know, you saw this sort of personality
[00:48:59.480 --> 00:49:01.400]   coming out that was like the same.
[00:49:01.400 --> 00:49:03.800]   That's neat.
[00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:04.760]   Google to government.
[00:49:04.760 --> 00:49:06.560]   Let us build a faster net.
[00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:10.480]   You saw that Facebook, by the way, has started a political action
[00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:14.160]   committee to promote social media, which strikes me
[00:49:14.160 --> 00:49:15.400]   as more to promote Facebook.
[00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:15.600]   I don't know.
[00:49:15.600 --> 00:49:17.520]   What do you think of that, Jeff Jarvis?
[00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:18.360]   You've spoken--
[00:49:18.360 --> 00:49:22.440]   Well, you know, yeah, I've--
[00:49:22.440 --> 00:49:25.240]   it's one part of this way.
[00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:26.840]   Some of the folks there have read the book,
[00:49:26.840 --> 00:49:27.840]   it's our whole plug right now.
[00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:29.480]   But I think that they want to--
[00:49:29.480 --> 00:49:31.960]   I know that they want to change the tender and tone
[00:49:31.960 --> 00:49:34.440]   and substance of the conversation around certain topics,
[00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:37.760]   like sharing in publicness, like tracking and all that.
[00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:38.880]   Aren't you nice?
[00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:39.880]   Great book.
[00:49:39.880 --> 00:49:40.680]   Great book.
[00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:42.200]   Great book.
[00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:43.120]   I said, I didn't say the name.
[00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:43.840]   I wasn't running a pocket.
[00:49:43.840 --> 00:49:45.840]   I was looking for my name, I didn't--
[00:49:45.840 --> 00:49:46.440]   It's in there.
[00:49:46.440 --> 00:49:47.440]   It's in there.
[00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:48.840]   I guess this is what you do, don't you?
[00:49:48.840 --> 00:49:50.880]   You flip to the end and say, where's he making me?
[00:49:50.880 --> 00:49:53.880]   Yeah, I heard an old boss of mine
[00:49:53.880 --> 00:49:56.480]   got the book of a night and that's the first thing he did.
[00:49:56.480 --> 00:49:57.360]   And he was safe.
[00:49:57.360 --> 00:49:58.720]   He had on pages seven and eight.
[00:49:58.720 --> 00:49:59.520]   That's good.
[00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:00.520]   That's your pages.
[00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:01.480]   That's your pages.
[00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:02.560]   Yeah.
[00:50:02.560 --> 00:50:03.880]   That's the law and then the port.
[00:50:03.880 --> 00:50:09.760]   And so I think that absolutely Facebook
[00:50:09.760 --> 00:50:13.640]   has to see that they have to change, just as Google
[00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:16.240]   had to learn that they have to go with policy.
[00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:18.600]   Facebook does too because they're affected by all this.
[00:50:18.600 --> 00:50:21.400]   They're affected by all this privacy talk, all this tracking
[00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:23.760]   and do not track talk.
[00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:26.600]   And not just here in the US, but certainly just
[00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:29.720]   like Google in Germany and the EU and all around.
[00:50:29.720 --> 00:50:31.480]   And I think that makes a big difference.
[00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:36.480]   And they have a hard time trying to recast that conversation.
[00:50:36.480 --> 00:50:37.320]   But they've got to be there.
[00:50:37.320 --> 00:50:39.680]   And the other thing that really struck me
[00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:46.360]   after watching Schmidt testify when we were on last week,
[00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:49.360]   that the next day-- and I kind of hinted at this earlier--
[00:50:49.360 --> 00:50:51.200]   you really saw that the Senate is going
[00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:53.720]   after yesterday's war, which is search.
[00:50:53.720 --> 00:50:57.200]   And tomorrow's war is sharing and signals and all that
[00:50:57.200 --> 00:50:58.600]   that I blather on about.
[00:50:58.600 --> 00:51:01.920]   And so it's like fighting Microsoft after Microsoft's
[00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:03.160]   going downhill.
[00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:04.880]   The Senate's way late to the party.
[00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:06.600]   We're late to the war now.
[00:51:06.600 --> 00:51:11.200]   And so the odd thing is you've got to go to Washington
[00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:13.480]   and convince them that the thing that doesn't matter anymore
[00:51:13.480 --> 00:51:14.960]   really doesn't matter.
[00:51:14.960 --> 00:51:17.160]   And maybe I guess hopefully you don't notice what really does
[00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:18.280]   matter in the future.
[00:51:18.280 --> 00:51:19.840]   But in that area where it does matter,
[00:51:19.840 --> 00:51:21.560]   there's huge competition.
[00:51:21.560 --> 00:51:24.440]   There's gigantic competition for--
[00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:28.360]   look, Amazon, Apple, Google, Facebook, Twitter.
[00:51:28.360 --> 00:51:33.680]   They're all competing for signals, searching,
[00:51:33.680 --> 00:51:37.520]   allowing us to share things, and a few of them
[00:51:37.520 --> 00:51:39.640]   on content delivery and discovery.
[00:51:39.640 --> 00:51:40.880]   So there's huge competition there,
[00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:44.560]   and Google does not own that world.
[00:51:44.560 --> 00:51:46.640]   And it's important the government understands
[00:51:46.640 --> 00:51:48.400]   these kinds of apps.
[00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:50.720]   And I'm a huge proponent, obviously,
[00:51:50.720 --> 00:51:52.680]   because this is kind of what I do in my full-time job.
[00:51:52.680 --> 00:51:55.000]   I mean, the government being more aware and more involved
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:57.320]   in social media is a good thing, even if it's
[00:51:57.320 --> 00:51:59.000]   about Facebook promoting it to them
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:00.440]   to help protect their own interests.
[00:52:00.440 --> 00:52:03.080]   I mean, it might be just about them understanding
[00:52:03.080 --> 00:52:05.480]   our elected leaders understanding how these things work.
[00:52:05.480 --> 00:52:07.320]   I mean, the fact is that this is where the people are,
[00:52:07.320 --> 00:52:09.840]   Facebook, Twitter, all these sort of social spaces.
[00:52:09.840 --> 00:52:13.240]   So I think that raising awareness and pushing those
[00:52:13.240 --> 00:52:17.440]   up toward government agencies is a good thing,
[00:52:17.440 --> 00:52:19.800]   definitely a good thing.
[00:52:19.800 --> 00:52:22.640]   Let's talk about the new Facebook.
[00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:25.600]   F8 conference, Mark Zuckerberg spoke on Thursday.
[00:52:25.600 --> 00:52:28.760]   We had seen quite a few changes already to Facebook,
[00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:30.600]   the ticker on the right and so forth.
[00:52:30.600 --> 00:52:34.080]   And then Facebook announced new profiles,
[00:52:34.080 --> 00:52:37.560]   the new timeline, and stories.
[00:52:37.560 --> 00:52:42.760]   And of course, apps interacting more directly with Facebook.
[00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:46.000]   In fact, I think what they really announced was,
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:49.120]   what they call it, frictionless sharing.
[00:52:49.120 --> 00:52:51.240]   In other words, the apps just don't even ask you anymore.
[00:52:51.240 --> 00:52:52.520]   They just tell you.
[00:52:52.520 --> 00:52:55.520]   It sounds a little bit like a ziplice F.
[00:52:55.520 --> 00:52:59.560]   Yes, with the tip of the hat to Erica.
[00:52:59.560 --> 00:53:00.560]   Yeah.
[00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:01.560]   Yeah.
[00:53:01.560 --> 00:53:02.840]   So this is the new timeline.
[00:53:02.840 --> 00:53:04.520]   You can turn it on with a little bit of a hack that
[00:53:04.520 --> 00:53:08.280]   was published in TechCrunch, basically establishing yourself
[00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:09.960]   as a developer.
[00:53:09.960 --> 00:53:11.800]   The subscribe button already made big changes.
[00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:14.880]   I've got more subscribers than I ever had fans on the fan
[00:53:14.880 --> 00:53:16.880]   page.
[00:53:16.880 --> 00:53:20.000]   And they kind of encourage you to go all the way down
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:22.320]   to when you were born.
[00:53:22.320 --> 00:53:25.880]   And they even say, hey, put a baby picture in there.
[00:53:25.880 --> 00:53:26.400]   So they can--
[00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:26.900]   Aww.
[00:53:26.900 --> 00:53:27.400]   Yeah.
[00:53:27.400 --> 00:53:28.080]   Oh, is that you?
[00:53:28.080 --> 00:53:28.560]   That's me.
[00:53:28.560 --> 00:53:28.760]   Is it--
[00:53:28.760 --> 00:53:29.640]   That's an early go?
[00:53:29.640 --> 00:53:30.080]   Yeah.
[00:53:30.080 --> 00:53:30.960]   That is.
[00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:34.480]   So what's interesting is, really, this is an ego page,
[00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:36.240]   obviously.
[00:53:36.240 --> 00:53:37.800]   And they give you dates in here.
[00:53:37.800 --> 00:53:39.640]   This is the date I graduated from high school.
[00:53:39.640 --> 00:53:41.480]   Is it the date I--
[00:53:41.480 --> 00:53:43.400]   what did I do on this date?
[00:53:43.400 --> 00:53:45.920]   Did not graduate from here.
[00:53:45.920 --> 00:53:47.680]   I have to-- they don't give you, by the way,
[00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:49.000]   this is the developer interface.
[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:53.160]   They don't give you a lot of ways to change this.
[00:53:53.160 --> 00:53:55.160]   For instance, I can't change this from graduated
[00:53:55.160 --> 00:54:00.320]   to un-graduated, dropped out.
[00:54:00.320 --> 00:54:04.840]   But it does give you quite a bit of--
[00:54:04.840 --> 00:54:07.720]   it takes material from all of your postings
[00:54:07.720 --> 00:54:12.480]   and kind of arranges it into a pretty cool looking
[00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:15.720]   timeline which you can then modify.
[00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:16.320]   I'm going to raise--
[00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:16.880]   It's beautiful interface.
[00:54:16.880 --> 00:54:18.000]   I think it's gorgeous.
[00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:19.120]   In fact, I love it.
[00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:20.800]   But I'm going to raise the question I raised last week
[00:54:20.800 --> 00:54:23.080]   and I've raised on Twitter as well.
[00:54:23.080 --> 00:54:25.680]   Isn't this going to scare the hell out of people who just
[00:54:25.680 --> 00:54:28.840]   want Facebook to share pictures with family and friends?
[00:54:28.840 --> 00:54:31.240]   But isn't that what every single time Facebook makes
[00:54:31.240 --> 00:54:32.120]   a big change, the stories--
[00:54:32.120 --> 00:54:33.200]   Yeah, but this is huge.
[00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:33.960]   This is not--
[00:54:33.960 --> 00:54:34.480]   I know.
[00:54:34.480 --> 00:54:35.160]   I know.
[00:54:35.160 --> 00:54:39.320]   Jake, my son Jake, is worried that his friends will leave.
[00:54:39.320 --> 00:54:41.080]   He didn't say that whether you like to or to the like it.
[00:54:41.080 --> 00:54:42.440]   He was playing coy with that.
[00:54:42.440 --> 00:54:44.000]   But what he told me-- I call him afterwards,
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:45.240]   just to hear what he thought.
[00:54:45.240 --> 00:54:46.760]   And he's worried that if his friends leave,
[00:54:46.760 --> 00:54:48.360]   that's the value of Facebook.
[00:54:48.360 --> 00:54:51.760]   Well, and that's what keeps people on Facebook, is it not?
[00:54:51.760 --> 00:54:54.960]   And the fact that there's where else you're going to go.
[00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:56.560]   Google+, that's what he said too.
[00:54:56.560 --> 00:54:58.800]   He said, but he argued that now there are more competitors.
[00:54:58.800 --> 00:55:01.000]   The Google+ is the beginning.
[00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:03.680]   Google+ feels like a Twitter competitor, not Facebook
[00:55:03.680 --> 00:55:04.440]   competitor.
[00:55:04.440 --> 00:55:05.920]   Yeah.
[00:55:05.920 --> 00:55:08.640]   I don't think people will go to Google+ to find college
[00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:12.840]   roommates and to share pictures with their mom.
[00:55:12.840 --> 00:55:18.160]   To me, this thing was Zuckerberg made us all do his plane
[00:55:18.160 --> 00:55:19.600]   vanilla before.
[00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:21.760]   And I think it's a big change in his head
[00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:25.040]   to really get more designed and to let us have more impact
[00:55:25.040 --> 00:55:25.560]   on that.
[00:55:25.560 --> 00:55:27.400]   I don't know.
[00:55:27.400 --> 00:55:29.600]   My problem is I've been doing nothing but feeding Twitter
[00:55:29.600 --> 00:55:30.400]   into it for three years.
[00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:32.160]   I'm going to look like I have no life.
[00:55:32.160 --> 00:55:33.040]   Yeah.
[00:55:33.040 --> 00:55:33.960]   Well, and that's another thing.
[00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:35.520]   Facebook's been saying it for a long time.
[00:55:35.520 --> 00:55:37.320]   Stop that.
[00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:38.800]   I don't have to say--
[00:55:38.800 --> 00:55:42.640]   I am kind of tempted to-- and I have, as you could see,
[00:55:42.640 --> 00:55:45.600]   fill this out a little bit to put more stuff in here.
[00:55:45.600 --> 00:55:47.920]   It's such a compelling experience that you go into it
[00:55:47.920 --> 00:55:49.680]   and you say, oh, no, actually, it wasn't that year.
[00:55:49.680 --> 00:55:50.400]   It was this year.
[00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:52.240]   And oh, I have a picture.
[00:55:52.240 --> 00:55:54.880]   You start because you love to look at the pictures
[00:55:54.880 --> 00:55:56.560]   and the stories of your life.
[00:55:56.560 --> 00:55:59.280]   And Zuckerberg's words, which I thought was really interesting.
[00:55:59.280 --> 00:56:04.800]   I think that people just want to define their identity
[00:56:04.800 --> 00:56:07.760]   and get so pulled into personal pictures and friendships
[00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:13.200]   that I think it'll be initially a little, hey, what happened.
[00:56:13.200 --> 00:56:15.280]   But I think then you just get sucked into it.
[00:56:15.280 --> 00:56:16.160]   Less so with the ticker.
[00:56:16.160 --> 00:56:18.560]   But with the timeline, I think it was just so compelling
[00:56:18.560 --> 00:56:22.600]   that folks will like it more than want to run from it.
[00:56:22.600 --> 00:56:25.840]   The ticker is really a big part of the frictionless sharing
[00:56:25.840 --> 00:56:29.560]   because if you go to your front page of Facebook,
[00:56:29.560 --> 00:56:32.640]   not your profile page, this ticker going by with people
[00:56:32.640 --> 00:56:35.440]   what they listened to, what they watched, what they liked,
[00:56:35.440 --> 00:56:37.000]   what they read.
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:38.760]   And then you just highlight over it
[00:56:38.760 --> 00:56:42.240]   and you can see the details of it.
[00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:45.120]   This is pretty impressive stuff, I have to say.
[00:56:45.120 --> 00:56:49.720]   This is really great design.
[00:56:49.720 --> 00:56:52.120]   But it's so much more complicated than it was.
[00:56:52.120 --> 00:56:53.040]   I just wanted--
[00:56:53.040 --> 00:56:53.560]   It is.
[00:56:53.560 --> 00:56:54.400]   It is.
[00:56:54.400 --> 00:56:56.600]   Yeah, and the top stories where they figure out what stories--
[00:56:56.600 --> 00:56:58.960]   Yeah, how do you know this is a top story?
[00:56:58.960 --> 00:57:01.160]   And then there's more recent stories.
[00:57:01.160 --> 00:57:03.840]   And what's the edge algorithm that they use to do that?
[00:57:03.840 --> 00:57:05.640]   And it's just a little confusing.
[00:57:05.640 --> 00:57:10.480]   Well, I've got to say, there's two significant things going on.
[00:57:10.480 --> 00:57:12.800]   There have been the change to the news feed itself
[00:57:12.800 --> 00:57:15.120]   where they're giving you those top stories and everything
[00:57:15.120 --> 00:57:15.320]   out.
[00:57:15.320 --> 00:57:17.160]   And it's the timeline that practically nobody
[00:57:17.160 --> 00:57:19.880]   has actually seen yet.
[00:57:19.880 --> 00:57:21.160]   If you didn't do the developer stuff,
[00:57:21.160 --> 00:57:22.520]   you haven't gotten to it.
[00:57:22.520 --> 00:57:23.080]   Nobody has it.
[00:57:23.080 --> 00:57:26.640]   But I really use Twitter a lot.
[00:57:26.640 --> 00:57:28.080]   And that just kind of fit for me.
[00:57:28.080 --> 00:57:31.440]   And then Google+ came along and I found myself kind of jumping
[00:57:31.440 --> 00:57:33.600]   into it and being involved both because I needed to understand
[00:57:33.600 --> 00:57:34.280]   it better.
[00:57:34.280 --> 00:57:35.840]   For whatever reason, I kind of liked it also.
[00:57:35.840 --> 00:57:37.800]   And I turned everything off of Facebook.
[00:57:37.800 --> 00:57:40.440]   Kind of the reasons, like, Gulia, with the privacy stuff,
[00:57:40.440 --> 00:57:42.320]   I just got done with it.
[00:57:42.320 --> 00:57:44.040]   So I fired up the fan page.
[00:57:44.040 --> 00:57:44.960]   That was pretty much it.
[00:57:44.960 --> 00:57:46.520]   And every so often, I'd post something there.
[00:57:46.520 --> 00:57:47.640]   And that was it.
[00:57:47.640 --> 00:57:49.040]   You could do that.
[00:57:49.040 --> 00:57:52.000]   And when they brought in the subscribe and also,
[00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:54.320]   since everything's all kind of locked down--
[00:57:54.320 --> 00:57:56.600]   or not locked down because I just assume everything
[00:57:56.600 --> 00:57:59.000]   I do on Facebook could be public at this point--
[00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:01.480]   that plus the new news feeder would ever kind of
[00:58:01.480 --> 00:58:02.400]   got me into it.
[00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:03.600]   I know I'm dead.
[00:58:03.600 --> 00:58:05.760]   It's terrible.
[00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:06.600]   And I'm going over there.
[00:58:06.600 --> 00:58:08.920]   And I'm like, wow, this is really kind of neat.
[00:58:08.920 --> 00:58:10.400]   This is--
[00:58:10.400 --> 00:58:13.200]   I'm seeing stuff from people that I'm not seeing on Twitter.
[00:58:13.200 --> 00:58:14.800]   Not because Twitter doesn't show me stuff,
[00:58:14.800 --> 00:58:17.000]   but because I have actually different social networks
[00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:18.520]   in different places.
[00:58:18.520 --> 00:58:20.400]   So I'm discovering other content,
[00:58:20.400 --> 00:58:22.480]   and I'm really kind of enjoying it.
[00:58:22.480 --> 00:58:26.280]   But the privacy stuff, when they made the change
[00:58:26.280 --> 00:58:29.800]   to subscribe in the new news feed, all the old stuff--
[00:58:29.800 --> 00:58:31.800]   if you remember about a year ago, they were all out
[00:58:31.800 --> 00:58:33.880]   yet the new supply privacy controls,
[00:58:33.880 --> 00:58:35.320]   and what can go here and what can go there.
[00:58:35.320 --> 00:58:37.760]   And I wrote a really long article about it.
[00:58:37.760 --> 00:58:39.840]   All that stuff immediately became outdated.
[00:58:39.840 --> 00:58:41.400]   All those controls don't exist anymore.
[00:58:41.400 --> 00:58:42.800]   They all went away.
[00:58:42.800 --> 00:58:46.040]   Yet another set of commands controls on what can you do,
[00:58:46.040 --> 00:58:47.680]   a dozen do, or whatever.
[00:58:47.680 --> 00:58:48.640]   And Danny, I think it's--
[00:58:48.640 --> 00:58:51.240]   Isn't it better that you get the opportunity--
[00:58:51.240 --> 00:58:53.640]   and I think the Google and Facebook are coming together
[00:58:53.640 --> 00:58:57.360]   here-- to make that decision whenever you share?
[00:58:57.360 --> 00:58:59.200]   Isn't that better than having controls--
[00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:00.080]   No, no, no, that's great.
[00:59:00.080 --> 00:59:03.240]   You can make the decision at the time you can do it.
[00:59:03.240 --> 00:59:06.720]   But what was striking me was when I brought up the timeline,
[00:59:06.720 --> 00:59:10.160]   I'm discovering on my timeline that posts that people
[00:59:10.160 --> 00:59:12.800]   had tagged me in that I didn't realize or hadn't noticed
[00:59:12.800 --> 00:59:16.160]   because they moved off so quickly were thrown up on there.
[00:59:16.160 --> 00:59:18.440]   Certain people were identified as friends.
[00:59:18.440 --> 00:59:20.000]   Like randomly decides which one
[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:23.360]   wants to send the front of somebody, whether or not
[00:59:23.360 --> 00:59:25.200]   that person was a particularly good friend,
[00:59:25.200 --> 00:59:27.040]   bad friend-- not bad friend, right?
[00:59:27.040 --> 00:59:29.280]   But I went through a time on Facebook
[00:59:29.280 --> 00:59:31.040]   that I think a number of people may have been through,
[00:59:31.040 --> 00:59:33.000]   where you just were like, oh, I guess I have to friend everybody,
[00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:33.520]   right?
[00:59:33.520 --> 00:59:35.160]   And so you're like, why is it featuring that person there?
[00:59:35.160 --> 00:59:36.760]   Why is it not featuring this person there?
[00:59:36.760 --> 00:59:39.040]   And then there was the thing that came out of, well, now
[00:59:39.040 --> 00:59:40.720]   you can tell when somebody was unfriended
[00:59:40.720 --> 00:59:41.760]   because it did the wrap up.
[00:59:41.760 --> 00:59:45.040]   And I actually went to and I got rid of everything that
[00:59:45.040 --> 00:59:46.960]   wasn't stuff that I had posted myself, right?
[00:59:46.960 --> 00:59:51.320]   Because I hadn't realized I had all this tagging that was going on.
[00:59:51.320 --> 00:59:53.960]   I don't even remember the controls that were there.
[00:59:53.960 --> 00:59:55.440]   There are controls now, right?
[00:59:55.440 --> 00:59:56.600]   They're really nice controls.
[00:59:56.600 --> 00:59:59.600]   So if somebody tags you, you can decide whether or not
[00:59:59.600 --> 01:00:03.360]   you want that to go onto your wall slash timeline or not.
[01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:05.440]   But I think in the past, you might not have noticed
[01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:06.880]   that it would have happened.
[01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:10.480]   But I just kind of got struck by, oh, wow, yet again,
[01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:13.640]   I feel like the privacy sands just shifted out
[01:00:13.640 --> 01:00:14.960]   underneath my feet.
[01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:18.400]   But the difference was this time, I didn't blame Facebook.
[01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:21.440]   I blamed myself and anybody who was still using Facebook
[01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:23.080]   that expected anything to say.
[01:00:23.080 --> 01:00:25.440]   I started to do a write up about it, right?
[01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:26.280]   Maybe I'll get back to it.
[01:00:26.280 --> 01:00:28.640]   I was like, I don't want to rain on everybody's parade,
[01:00:28.640 --> 01:00:30.520]   but it feels like everything shifted around again.
[01:00:30.520 --> 01:00:33.600]   And really, it's our own fault because that's what Facebook does.
[01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:35.880]   It's going to move everything whenever it wants to.
[01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:39.320]   And if you haven't gotten the point at this point,
[01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:40.800]   that that's always going to happen.
[01:00:40.800 --> 01:00:43.920]   And you never really quite know what's going on with your privacy
[01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:47.880]   and that you've just treated everything publicly, then good luck with that.
[01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:50.040]   It really is a stalkers delight.
[01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:51.600]   Look at this.
[01:00:51.600 --> 01:00:54.120]   Eileen just checked in at the break house.
[01:00:54.120 --> 01:00:55.520]   And not only did she just check in,
[01:00:55.520 --> 01:00:56.760]   but look, it's put a dot in the map,
[01:00:56.760 --> 01:00:58.680]   just in case I'm trying to find her.
[01:00:58.680 --> 01:01:01.760]   I can, I mean, this is stuff.
[01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:02.840]   She is your friend.
[01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:05.640]   She's my friend, I guess.
[01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:07.560]   Do people know what's going on here?
[01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:09.280]   Yeah, she checked in, right?
[01:01:09.280 --> 01:01:10.200]   Eileen's hurt now.
[01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:10.520]   She's wrong.
[01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:11.280]   No, she's my friend.
[01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:11.880]   No, no, no.
[01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:13.440]   But I'm also subscribing to people.
[01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:17.320]   I mean, if Ariana Huffington checks in, unless she's careful,
[01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:19.520]   I may well see exactly where she is as well.
[01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:21.000]   And then that's the weird thing, too, again,
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.640]   where the Facebook's hand shift all over the place, right?
[01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:25.000]   It's not just friends in here.
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.920]   These are people I subscribe to.
[01:01:26.920 --> 01:01:29.840]   If you run a brand or publication, right?
[01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:33.320]   First it was, I guess you could have a personal account.
[01:01:33.320 --> 01:01:34.160]   Then it was like groups.
[01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:36.280]   So then people would get groups for their organizations.
[01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:38.200]   But then we got, oh, we can have fan pages.
[01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:40.520]   OK, so now we have fan pages.
[01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:42.800]   And then groups change into something else.
[01:01:42.800 --> 01:01:45.600]   And then fan pages get renamed like pages.
[01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:48.680]   And now, and then fan pages were positioned as a way,
[01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:50.880]   for example, authors to go out there and do something
[01:01:50.880 --> 01:01:52.560]   on Facebook where you could share to the public
[01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:53.640]   and not have to approve people.
[01:01:53.640 --> 01:01:56.840]   And now, so I've got like 3,000 fans.
[01:01:56.840 --> 01:02:00.200]   And I have like 400 people who've subscribed to me now.
[01:02:00.200 --> 01:02:01.440]   But now I don't want to use my fan.
[01:02:01.440 --> 01:02:03.560]   I don't know what to do with my fan page at this point.
[01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:06.680]   I like post out there saying, hey,
[01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:07.960]   yeah, I wish you could move people over.
[01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:09.880]   I wish you could move people on this other thing now.
[01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:11.920]   They're building a tool to let you do that.
[01:02:11.920 --> 01:02:12.880]   Well, they are. OK, go on.
[01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:13.840]   Yes.
[01:02:13.840 --> 01:02:14.040]   Yeah.
[01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:16.640]   I want to take people who are fans and make those subscribers.
[01:02:16.640 --> 01:02:19.480]   And I want to take people I hadn't said OK to
[01:02:19.480 --> 01:02:21.680]   and make them subscribe.
[01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:22.480]   Ah, I don't know.
[01:02:22.480 --> 01:02:23.480]   I don't know if they're doing that.
[01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:26.360]   But it leads to just assume, as Danny did,
[01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:28.000]   that everything's public on here.
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.280]   And I'm only going to put stuff on here if it's public.
[01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:33.560]   But that's not, I would say, the majority of Facebook users.
[01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:37.200]   If you see this as a broadcast medium, like Twitter,
[01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:38.600]   you're probably very comfortable with this.
[01:02:38.600 --> 01:02:40.680]   Well, I think where it goes, because they don't know
[01:02:40.680 --> 01:02:44.120]   the circles that Google has, you really can't get to find a point.
[01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:46.400]   I mean, they have now, but I'm not going to go back and redo them.
[01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:47.920]   You can get to a very fine point.
[01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:49.440]   Look, they now I can post a place.
[01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:52.120]   But you guys go back and redo everybody to do that.
[01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:54.920]   I didn't know because many of these lists were created automatically by--
[01:02:54.920 --> 01:02:55.440]   Yeah, I know.
[01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:56.920]   But even so, you're not going to trust them.
[01:02:56.920 --> 01:02:59.040]   I mean, I think you're going to have three layers on Facebook.
[01:02:59.040 --> 01:03:02.000]   One is a group that you made, your family, you know who it is.
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.920]   The other is people you've friended, and the other is the world.
[01:03:04.920 --> 01:03:05.760]   Yeah.
[01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:06.280]   And it's where--
[01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:11.120]   Jeep, Jeep, Jeep, you talk eloquently about trying to share and having concerns and all that.
[01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:14.640]   What do you think about this as a user of Facebook?
[01:03:14.640 --> 01:03:16.920]   The timeline or the ticker?
[01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:17.400]   Everything.
[01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:18.480]   They're the kind of sense of privacy
[01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:20.840]   and how you think you'll use it or not use it.
[01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:23.560]   Yeah, I'm honestly pretty wary of the ticker.
[01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:28.120]   I don't see myself wanting to broadcast what song I'm listening to
[01:03:28.120 --> 01:03:31.120]   or like what I'm cooking that night or what book I'm reading.
[01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:34.680]   And I think this is just because I wrote Life Hacker for So Long
[01:03:34.680 --> 01:03:39.480]   and the site was so popular that I became a little maybe extra protective of my privacy
[01:03:39.480 --> 01:03:41.000]   because I had such a big audience.
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:42.520]   I had the privilege of a big audience.
[01:03:42.520 --> 01:03:44.120]   But that made me kind of draw in a little bit.
[01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:46.040]   So that's not something that I would want to do.
[01:03:46.040 --> 01:03:49.720]   But I could see how my Stor-in-law, for example,
[01:03:49.720 --> 01:03:52.960]   has a close circle of friends and she's a stay-at-home mom.
[01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:57.000]   And I can see how that kind of sharing with her friends would be really gratifying
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000]   and would make a lot of sense.
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:03.080]   You know, they have Google Buzz-style privacy issues in here.
[01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:06.600]   But it's so deeply buried that there will not be this kind of bruh-ha.
[01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:08.120]   For instance, here's an example.
[01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:11.480]   If I share something with a list of specific people,
[01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:15.720]   the names of all of those people that I've shared with are now available
[01:04:15.720 --> 01:04:17.640]   publicly to everybody else on that list.
[01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:20.200]   Now, that's exactly what happened on Buzz.
[01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:24.040]   But it's so confusing and convoluted that no,
[01:04:24.040 --> 01:04:25.960]   but you're not going to see the same hue and cry.
[01:04:25.960 --> 01:04:29.160]   But there are absolutely all sorts of information leaks.
[01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:31.320]   This thing is riddled with information leaks.
[01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:32.600]   Yeah, it is.
[01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:35.000]   You know, I found myself wondering, listening to these announcements,
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:36.360]   it's like, what apps did I say?
[01:04:36.360 --> 01:04:40.280]   It's OK for them to talk to us because I give them the permission up front
[01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:41.800]   instead of during that slide.
[01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:44.440]   Furthermore, we thought that the like button, for instance,
[01:04:44.440 --> 01:04:47.000]   would only track you if you remained logged into Facebook.
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:48.760]   Now it turns out it's always tracking.
[01:04:48.760 --> 01:04:49.720]   That's been fixed.
[01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:50.200]   That's wrong.
[01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:51.240]   That's been fixed.
[01:04:51.240 --> 01:04:51.800]   That's been fixed.
[01:04:51.800 --> 01:04:52.680]   OK, correct me.
[01:04:52.680 --> 01:04:55.480]   It not only was it been fixed, but it wasn't broken to begin with.
[01:04:55.480 --> 01:04:59.960]   And the article that was written was kind of like almost pedestrian.
[01:04:59.960 --> 01:05:03.480]   When they've rolled out the ability for you to, first of all,
[01:05:03.480 --> 01:05:05.640]   like a page and see what your friends are,
[01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:10.120]   and to some degree, it's obvious that when you go to that page,
[01:05:10.120 --> 01:05:13.560]   it's obvious, I think, to more text-savvy people.
[01:05:13.560 --> 01:05:15.320]   But it's obvious when you go to that page
[01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:18.120]   that if the button is there and you're seeing stuff,
[01:05:18.120 --> 01:05:21.080]   and these are all your friends that Facebook knows you're on the page,
[01:05:21.080 --> 01:05:23.640]   because otherwise, had Facebook do that in the first place, right?
[01:05:23.640 --> 01:05:29.880]   But there was a difference between Facebook has a cookie
[01:05:29.880 --> 01:05:34.200]   so that when you go out onto a page where there's also Facebook code,
[01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:38.840]   Facebook will personalize that page as opposed to Facebook is somehow
[01:05:38.840 --> 01:05:41.640]   using that cookie to track every page you go to on the web.
[01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:42.280]   They're not.
[01:05:42.280 --> 01:05:42.920]   They can't.
[01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:45.080]   They can't track every page you go to on the web.
[01:05:45.080 --> 01:05:48.920]   They can only track the pages you go to that have Facebook code on them,
[01:05:48.920 --> 01:05:49.960]   which is a lot of pages.
[01:05:49.960 --> 01:05:54.440]   Which is everybody, and Facebook's making sure that it's almost more and more all the time.
[01:05:54.440 --> 01:05:55.800]   But it's like a little bit too long.
[01:05:55.800 --> 01:05:57.000]   So let's make this clear.
[01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:58.600]   Are we wrong?
[01:05:58.600 --> 01:06:01.960]   When I say that I go, okay, I've logged out of Facebook on my browser.
[01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:04.520]   But I still have Facebook cookies on here,
[01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:06.360]   uniquely identifying Facebook cookies.
[01:06:06.360 --> 01:06:08.360]   When I go to a page with a like button,
[01:06:08.360 --> 01:06:11.480]   isn't that cookie collected regardless of whether I'm logged on Facebook?
[01:06:11.480 --> 01:06:17.880]   They've changed that.
[01:06:17.880 --> 01:06:18.680]   There's a journal version of it too.
[01:06:18.680 --> 01:06:19.480]   It's confusing.
[01:06:19.480 --> 01:06:21.880]   Danny, I'm sure could do a much better job explaining this than I can.
[01:06:21.880 --> 01:06:26.360]   But they had a few cookies that did still record on the cookie,
[01:06:26.360 --> 01:06:28.200]   but they didn't log it, they said.
[01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:33.320]   They logged only one cookie if I've got this right to try to track false logins
[01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:34.840]   or some such thing that I don't understand.
[01:06:34.840 --> 01:06:39.240]   But even that logging, that non-logged recording cookie,
[01:06:39.240 --> 01:06:41.080]   they said, shouldn't have been doing that and they've changed it.
[01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:41.960]   So we'll do that now.
[01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:45.000]   If you're signed out, the cookie won't record that you were there.
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:45.560]   Right, Danny?
[01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:47.880]   I haven't gotten that.
[01:06:47.880 --> 01:06:48.840]   I haven't gotten that.
[01:06:48.840 --> 01:06:53.080]   I guess because I wasn't that concerned about what I'm saying in the first place.
[01:06:53.080 --> 01:06:56.440]   It's sort of like saying, I'm logged out of Google,
[01:06:56.440 --> 01:06:59.560]   but I go to a page and there's Google Analytics and that Google Analytics
[01:06:59.560 --> 01:07:03.880]   recorded that I visited from an IP address or more better.
[01:07:03.880 --> 01:07:06.840]   I'm logged out of Google and yeah,
[01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:10.200]   I went to a web page and that web page is showing me ads from Google
[01:07:10.200 --> 01:07:12.760]   that in turn may be targeted through Google's ad system.
[01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:15.000]   That's a good point.
[01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:18.440]   Every page already logs your unique one and only IP address.
[01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:21.080]   This time's there.
[01:07:21.080 --> 01:07:24.440]   And so to me, the concern wasn't, oh my goodness,
[01:07:24.440 --> 01:07:26.360]   Facebook knows I was on that page.
[01:07:26.360 --> 01:07:29.160]   The real concern is much, I think, better than that.
[01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:33.960]   How do I know a page's Facebook is tracked and how do I delete that information?
[01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:38.040]   With Google, with Google, you can go through and if you're using
[01:07:38.040 --> 01:07:42.440]   web history and you've actually used their toolbar,
[01:07:42.440 --> 01:07:44.200]   you can delete all that stuff.
[01:07:44.200 --> 01:07:46.680]   What you can't do with Google is cause Google to
[01:07:46.680 --> 01:07:50.120]   every page it has tracked you from a particular cookie
[01:07:50.120 --> 01:07:53.080]   because they've done that through the ad targeting.
[01:07:53.080 --> 01:07:55.960]   But you can at least opt out of ad targeting altogether.
[01:07:55.960 --> 01:07:57.400]   But I think that's what we really need.
[01:07:57.400 --> 01:08:01.000]   It's like, hey, if you're collecting information as to what my personally
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.400]   identifiable account seems to be doing,
[01:08:03.400 --> 01:08:06.520]   then give me something like the Google Dashboard and keep growing it
[01:08:06.520 --> 01:08:08.120]   so I can see what you've got.
[01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:10.920]   And I can clear it out periodically from time to time if I want to.
[01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:14.600]   Yeah, the dashboard is Google's response to all this.
[01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:17.880]   I doubt you'd ever see anything like that from Facebook, though.
[01:08:17.880 --> 01:08:23.240]   No, I kind of agree with you.
[01:08:23.240 --> 01:08:28.520]   Facebook always feels like you've got a poll and tug to get the things that you want
[01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:30.600]   because they've changed yet another thing again.
[01:08:32.440 --> 01:08:37.000]   But that's the other thing that bothers me because we've got to run.
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.640]   But the coercive nature of the Facebook environment
[01:08:39.640 --> 01:08:40.840]   reminds me a little bit of Farmville.
[01:08:40.840 --> 01:08:43.160]   Now, this Spotify thing is a perfect example.
[01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:45.240]   I don't know how they convince Spotify to do this,
[01:08:45.240 --> 01:08:49.400]   but you cannot create a new Spotify account without being a Facebook user.
[01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:49.800]   Period.
[01:08:49.800 --> 01:08:51.320]   Is that where it's just in the UK?
[01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:55.080]   It doesn't make any better if it's just UK,
[01:08:55.080 --> 01:08:57.080]   but I thought it was only something that was happening in the UK.
[01:08:57.080 --> 01:08:59.320]   But you're still not--
[01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:01.000]   If that's the case, I misunderstood that.
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:09.880]   But in other words, I think that's just the beginning of this kind of coercion,
[01:09:09.880 --> 01:09:12.520]   where if all your friends and all the sites you visit,
[01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:16.600]   if you can only make a comment on TechCrunch via Facebook Connect,
[01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:19.560]   if you can only listen to music on Spotify via Facebook login,
[01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:26.840]   this ecosystem becomes a lock-in to Facebook, and it becomes very scary.
[01:09:26.840 --> 01:09:30.760]   I think that if you're a brand or you're somebody who's running a product,
[01:09:31.400 --> 01:09:34.840]   why would you do this?
[01:09:34.840 --> 01:09:38.120]   I should be able to interact with you directly
[01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:42.360]   without having to go through some third party to use your products and services.
[01:09:42.360 --> 01:09:45.880]   That's just something you should have a direct relationship with your customer to begin with.
[01:09:45.880 --> 01:09:47.480]   And I shouldn't have to rely on a third party.
[01:09:47.480 --> 01:09:49.960]   What a third party may want to do to use your service.
[01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:51.160]   And I agree.
[01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:53.000]   Of course, there's a huge value to the third party.
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:55.880]   You get access to 750 million users.
[01:09:55.880 --> 01:09:57.960]   Who knows what's that?
[01:09:57.960 --> 01:10:00.520]   Who are broadcasting every single thing that they do always.
[01:10:00.520 --> 01:10:02.760]   Who will let all their friends know they just find out.
[01:10:02.760 --> 01:10:04.760]   I love it because I already do that.
[01:10:04.760 --> 01:10:06.760]   But I worry about everybody else.
[01:10:06.760 --> 01:10:11.560]   I know I was thinking the timeline makes Facebook like Leo's broadcasting time.
[01:10:11.560 --> 01:10:12.840]   My life, I love this.
[01:10:12.840 --> 01:10:15.720]   Here's where I think I was long.
[01:10:15.720 --> 01:10:19.080]   I believe that Facebook, if it can start today,
[01:10:19.080 --> 01:10:21.480]   would come out and call itself a sharing service.
[01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:21.960]   Yes.
[01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:23.800]   But why did they make this pivot?
[01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:25.160]   That weren't they doing already?
[01:10:25.160 --> 01:10:25.480]   Really.
[01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:27.000]   Here's the thing, Leo, it's positioning.
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:29.560]   It started off, you had friends, you shared with those friends.
[01:10:29.560 --> 01:10:32.760]   And people got out of this impression that there was kind of a vault
[01:10:32.760 --> 01:10:34.280]   where I put my secrets with my friends.
[01:10:34.280 --> 01:10:36.680]   But of course, you tell people stuff, they'll blather it.
[01:10:36.680 --> 01:10:37.720]   And it's not.
[01:10:37.720 --> 01:10:39.320]   You're sharing with them.
[01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:41.640]   But it was like real life in the sense,
[01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:46.040]   yeah, if I tell you a secret and you tell Danny, well, shame on you.
[01:10:46.040 --> 01:10:48.120]   But I still, I'm sharing with you.
[01:10:48.120 --> 01:10:49.720]   I'm not sharing with Spotify.
[01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:52.040]   I agree with that.
[01:10:52.040 --> 01:10:52.440]   I agree with it.
[01:10:52.440 --> 01:10:54.840]   But I think that whether that's true or not,
[01:10:54.840 --> 01:10:58.200]   Facebook certainly encouraged the belief and the feeling
[01:10:58.200 --> 01:11:00.120]   that you were vaulting your information.
[01:11:00.120 --> 01:11:01.960]   No, I think that was their mistake.
[01:11:01.960 --> 01:11:03.720]   I think that they did that on way in the--
[01:11:03.720 --> 01:11:04.920]   because they said, oh, we have all these controls.
[01:11:04.920 --> 01:11:05.720]   We have all this, and we have that,
[01:11:05.720 --> 01:11:06.120]   and we have that, and we have that,
[01:11:06.120 --> 01:11:07.640]   and we want to make people comfortable and secure.
[01:11:07.640 --> 01:11:08.120]   They shouldn't have.
[01:11:08.120 --> 01:11:10.200]   They should have said, this is a place to share.
[01:11:10.200 --> 01:11:13.080]   If it's a secret, don't put it here, you fool.
[01:11:13.080 --> 01:11:14.600]   I feel--
[01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:16.200]   See, you're being very generous.
[01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:19.160]   I feel that Facebook knew perfectly well what it was doing,
[01:11:19.160 --> 01:11:21.880]   and coerced people into putting information in there
[01:11:21.880 --> 01:11:24.440]   in a time when they would have been uncomfortable to see it there.
[01:11:24.440 --> 01:11:26.920]   Unless they assured them, oh, don't worry.
[01:11:26.920 --> 01:11:28.840]   It's completely safe and private here.
[01:11:28.840 --> 01:11:31.080]   Otherwise, nobody would have done it.
[01:11:31.080 --> 01:11:31.960]   Now, but those are probably--
[01:11:31.960 --> 01:11:32.760]   But those have changed.
[01:11:32.760 --> 01:11:34.760]   And we've got Twitter, and we've got Google,
[01:11:34.760 --> 01:11:36.360]   and people are going, eh, what the hell?
[01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:37.160]   I'll share everything.
[01:11:37.160 --> 01:11:37.960]   So another thing.
[01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:39.320]   Oh, yeah, by the way.
[01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:41.080]   You shared everything.
[01:11:41.080 --> 01:11:43.000]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:45.960]   I take the point, Leo, but by the way,
[01:11:45.960 --> 01:11:48.600]   last week when we disagreed, people loved the fact
[01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:49.240]   that we disagreed.
[01:11:49.240 --> 01:11:50.040]   We didn't always agree.
[01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:50.600]   So let's go ahead.
[01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:51.160]   We're disagreeing.
[01:11:51.160 --> 01:11:52.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:11:52.680 --> 01:11:54.840]   No, I'm not a conspiracy theorist that way.
[01:11:54.840 --> 01:11:59.880]   I think it was the change from being in the closed community
[01:11:59.880 --> 01:12:03.800]   of a college to the world, and that they architected
[01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:05.720]   something that was made for a campus,
[01:12:05.720 --> 01:12:07.720]   where there are certain norms and understandings
[01:12:07.720 --> 01:12:10.520]   of how the society operates, and the world does not
[01:12:10.520 --> 01:12:11.640]   operate that way.
[01:12:11.640 --> 01:12:11.880]   Right.
[01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:14.040]   Campus is a closed place with security,
[01:12:14.040 --> 01:12:16.680]   and your friends are on your dorm room hall,
[01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:19.560]   and in your classrooms, and it's enclosed.
[01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:21.080]   This station was about connection.
[01:12:21.080 --> 01:12:21.800]   And there's more complex.
[01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:22.440]   Yes.
[01:12:22.440 --> 01:12:22.760]   Right.
[01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:26.040]   Facebook was about connection initially.
[01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:28.680]   And connection is a lot about intimacy,
[01:12:28.680 --> 01:12:31.240]   and about sharing things that you don't want other people to know.
[01:12:31.240 --> 01:12:33.400]   And that's just kind of inherent in it.
[01:12:33.400 --> 01:12:35.000]   When the timeline came out, I really
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.880]   started to think about public performance
[01:12:37.880 --> 01:12:39.960]   versus who you really are.
[01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:41.720]   I'm going to publish my wedding pictures,
[01:12:41.720 --> 01:12:43.000]   for example, on my timeline.
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:44.360]   Because it was a big event in my life,
[01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:47.240]   but I'm not going to publish the details of my horrible divorce.
[01:12:47.240 --> 01:12:50.280]   And so I put out this question to my Twitter followers,
[01:12:50.280 --> 01:12:54.040]   the stories that you write in social media,
[01:12:54.040 --> 01:12:56.760]   is that the real you, or is that the published kind of public you?
[01:12:56.760 --> 01:12:58.680]   That's a great conversation.
[01:12:58.680 --> 01:13:01.240]   And someone said, the person who I am online
[01:13:01.240 --> 01:13:03.240]   is the person my grandmother thinks I am.
[01:13:03.240 --> 01:13:05.480]   Which I thought was such a great answer,
[01:13:05.480 --> 01:13:09.080]   because you edit things down, and don't get too controversial,
[01:13:09.080 --> 01:13:10.840]   or to hear feelings.
[01:13:10.840 --> 01:13:13.720]   I think that's one of the risks of living in public.
[01:13:13.720 --> 01:13:15.960]   And actually, I wanted to have this conversation with Jeff,
[01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:16.680]   of course.
[01:13:16.680 --> 01:13:17.000]   Right.
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.960]   But Regina, wouldn't you say that what this does,
[01:13:19.960 --> 01:13:23.640]   the edging of more publicness, and please chat room.
[01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:28.040]   I'm not trying to plug the book now, but that it changes the--
[01:13:28.040 --> 01:13:29.400]   Just follow with plugging the book.
[01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:29.800]   Plug the book.
[01:13:29.800 --> 01:13:30.680]   Plug the book.
[01:13:30.680 --> 01:13:32.360]   It changes society, right?
[01:13:32.360 --> 01:13:36.440]   So if I may use you as an example, if this was 30 years ago,
[01:13:36.440 --> 01:13:40.600]   you would have had a reason to be very cautious about saying
[01:13:40.600 --> 01:13:41.800]   that you were a lesbian.
[01:13:41.800 --> 01:13:42.360]   Right.
[01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:43.160]   Right?
[01:13:43.160 --> 01:13:43.640]   Right?
[01:13:43.640 --> 01:13:43.960]   Right.
[01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:46.280]   And the consequences of doing so,
[01:13:46.280 --> 01:13:49.160]   and the benefits of doing so,
[01:13:49.160 --> 01:13:50.680]   the equation was utterly different.
[01:13:50.680 --> 01:13:55.880]   Now, I argue in the book that publicness was the greatest weapon
[01:13:55.880 --> 01:13:58.280]   that gays and lesbians had against the bigots who forced them
[01:13:58.280 --> 01:13:58.680]   to clause.
[01:13:58.680 --> 01:14:01.080]   And I also argue that no one should be forced out of the closet.
[01:14:01.080 --> 01:14:04.200]   But the equation there passes to a certain point where
[01:14:04.200 --> 01:14:11.080]   you come out because it does challenge the bigots to say,
[01:14:11.080 --> 01:14:12.280]   you got a problem with this?
[01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:12.760]   Right.
[01:14:12.760 --> 01:14:14.680]   And then you come out because you can,
[01:14:14.680 --> 01:14:16.680]   and then you come out simply because you want to it.
[01:14:16.680 --> 01:14:17.240]   Why not?
[01:14:17.240 --> 01:14:18.040]   Right.
[01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:18.600]   Right.
[01:14:18.600 --> 01:14:21.000]   And but the act of being public in those things,
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.400]   I do believe leads in bit by bit,
[01:14:23.400 --> 01:14:25.240]   brave, step by brave, step to more tolerance.
[01:14:25.240 --> 01:14:26.440]   Absolutely.
[01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:28.200]   I completely, completely agree.
[01:14:28.200 --> 01:14:32.520]   And, you know, it's okay for me to be out of the closet to grandma now.
[01:14:32.520 --> 01:14:33.080]   Right.
[01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:33.480]   Exactly.
[01:14:33.480 --> 01:14:35.400]   Maybe a few generations ago, it was not.
[01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:36.120]   Oh, God, no.
[01:14:36.120 --> 01:14:36.280]   Yeah.
[01:14:36.280 --> 01:14:40.520]   My gay uncle, may he rest in peace, Richard.
[01:14:40.520 --> 01:14:44.360]   My grandparents, they're dying, well, not to their dying day,
[01:14:44.360 --> 01:14:45.240]   but almost their dying day.
[01:14:45.240 --> 01:14:46.360]   They just kind of didn't get it.
[01:14:46.360 --> 01:14:49.560]   And I'm very proud of my father that he made my uncle tell them.
[01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:50.120]   That's neat.
[01:14:50.120 --> 01:14:51.000]   Oh, that's great.
[01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.560]   And it was very neat because he had to be him.
[01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:54.600]   But here's the point.
[01:14:54.600 --> 01:14:56.200]   He had to be himself with his own parents.
[01:14:56.200 --> 01:15:01.160]   Maybe though he lived with Jay the same kind for 35 years.
[01:15:01.160 --> 01:15:02.200]   This is a long time.
[01:15:02.200 --> 01:15:03.880]   There's a cognitive dissonance.
[01:15:03.880 --> 01:15:06.040]   It's a very powerful force in parenthood, right?
[01:15:06.040 --> 01:15:12.680]   But, you know, I think that that's important is that the closer you feel you can get
[01:15:12.680 --> 01:15:15.240]   to your authentic self.
[01:15:15.960 --> 01:15:16.920]   Isn't that a better word?
[01:15:16.920 --> 01:15:17.800]   Yes.
[01:15:17.800 --> 01:15:18.520]   Yes.
[01:15:18.520 --> 01:15:19.400]   I do.
[01:15:19.400 --> 01:15:19.880]   I agree.
[01:15:19.880 --> 01:15:21.000]   I do agree with that.
[01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:21.800]   Absolutely.
[01:15:21.800 --> 01:15:23.880]   As since we're on privacy, and I didn't see somebody's yelling at the chatroom,
[01:15:23.880 --> 01:15:26.360]   but if it's on privacy, I want to mention one more thing, if I may,
[01:15:26.360 --> 01:15:28.760]   because I just want to say, ha, ha, ha, ha.
[01:15:28.760 --> 01:15:33.320]   The Wall Street Journal was going wacky with all kinds of series about how
[01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:37.240]   how awful companies are, what they know about you, and cookies are evil,
[01:15:37.240 --> 01:15:38.200]   and tracking is awful.
[01:15:38.200 --> 01:15:42.440]   And yeah, yeah, yeah, well, they just changed their quote unquote privacy policy,
[01:15:42.440 --> 01:15:45.000]   which means that they are now going to attach your real name.
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:48.360]   And mind you, most media properties do not have your real name.
[01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:49.320]   They don't know who you are.
[01:15:49.320 --> 01:15:49.960]   They know your IP.
[01:15:49.960 --> 01:15:50.920]   They don't know who you are.
[01:15:50.920 --> 01:15:54.040]   The Wall Street Journal, because it's a description, has your name and your address
[01:15:54.040 --> 01:15:54.920]   and your credit card.
[01:15:54.920 --> 01:15:58.520]   And they're going to attach your real name to your browsing history without
[01:15:58.520 --> 01:16:00.360]   notice, consent, or control.
[01:16:00.360 --> 01:16:02.680]   Oh, yeah, Wall Street Journal.
[01:16:02.680 --> 01:16:04.360]   You're such a protector of the people.
[01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:05.320]   She's Louise.
[01:16:05.320 --> 01:16:08.280]   That includes, by the way, all things D, market watch,
[01:16:08.280 --> 01:16:10.840]   bear in smart money, as well as WSD.com.
[01:16:10.840 --> 01:16:13.960]   Oh, I assume it already wiretapped at all anyway, so I don't understand.
[01:16:13.960 --> 01:16:15.160]   That's a little rude.
[01:16:15.160 --> 01:16:16.520]   Hello, Rupert.
[01:16:16.520 --> 01:16:17.720]   Bravo, Daddy, bravo.
[01:16:17.720 --> 01:16:20.440]   I teach my entrepreneurial class.
[01:16:20.440 --> 01:16:23.960]   I always go through the first class, the business plan for entertainment weekly.
[01:16:23.960 --> 01:16:27.880]   May it not quite rust and peace, and may I rest in peace there.
[01:16:27.880 --> 01:16:31.240]   And I was going through the budget this time, and I saw there was this line for
[01:16:31.240 --> 01:16:36.520]   list rental, and I forgot about this, that of course, magazine sold your name and your
[01:16:36.520 --> 01:16:41.560]   address, and the fact that you read that magazine, openly, no notice, no consent,
[01:16:41.560 --> 01:16:44.520]   no opportunity to change it, no privacy policy, nothing.
[01:16:44.520 --> 01:16:46.280]   It used to be a lot worse.
[01:16:46.280 --> 01:16:50.040]   We have a lot more controls now, except at News Corp.
[01:16:50.040 --> 01:16:52.520]   Isn't that funny?
[01:16:52.520 --> 01:16:53.960]   Isn't that ironic?
[01:16:53.960 --> 01:16:54.920]   Love it.
[01:16:54.920 --> 01:16:55.880]   Using it properly now?
[01:16:55.880 --> 01:16:56.760]   Yes.
[01:16:56.760 --> 01:16:59.560]   I didn't go to college.
[01:16:59.560 --> 01:17:00.440]   I dropped out.
[01:17:00.440 --> 01:17:06.200]   Let's quickly, as we're running out of time, get to Agena's tip, Jeff's number,
[01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:09.320]   and my tool of the week at Danny just chime in.
[01:17:09.320 --> 01:17:10.760]   Can we go to Jeff's number first?
[01:17:10.760 --> 01:17:12.200]   Because we lost Jeena's video.
[01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:14.520]   Yes, let's start with your number, Jeff.
[01:17:14.520 --> 01:17:16.680]   Jay, I'll go to two different numbers.
[01:17:16.680 --> 01:17:17.480]   We're actually three.
[01:17:17.480 --> 01:17:23.800]   Real quickly, one is, all things D already has an estimate up that Amazon is losing $50
[01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:25.480]   per Amazon fire.
[01:17:25.480 --> 01:17:30.440]   Who knows how they got that number, but I find that interesting.
[01:17:30.440 --> 01:17:36.600]   Number two, Netflix has lost $9 billion in market cap, and there's speculation that it
[01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:39.080]   makes it now an acquisition target.
[01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:43.080]   At the same time, Google has reportedly offered $4 billion for Hulu,
[01:17:43.080 --> 01:17:46.680]   which I think all ties back into our earlier conversation about content,
[01:17:46.680 --> 01:17:50.920]   and who can offer what to whom through what.
[01:17:50.920 --> 01:17:53.640]   And I think we're going to see an interesting war going on there.
[01:17:53.640 --> 01:17:59.160]   I might point out it was Gene Munster that came up with the $50 loss per Amazon fire.
[01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:02.440]   Gene is not, despite the fact that he's a well-known analyst from Piper Jeffrey,
[01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:05.400]   not notorious for his insider accuracy.
[01:18:06.360 --> 01:18:10.280]   So one of the tear down sites said it was $188 per
[01:18:10.280 --> 01:18:13.000]   based on purely components.
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:16.760]   So it's probably very close to cost if not a loss.
[01:18:16.760 --> 01:18:17.240]   It's a loss.
[01:18:17.240 --> 01:18:17.560]   Yeah.
[01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:18.280]   Yeah.
[01:18:18.280 --> 01:18:21.160]   We got Gina Bakker, no.
[01:18:21.160 --> 01:18:22.280]   Well, Gina?
[01:18:22.280 --> 01:18:23.480]   Hi.
[01:18:23.480 --> 01:18:25.080]   Speaking, we don't need to see.
[01:18:25.080 --> 01:18:26.040]   We'll imagine.
[01:18:26.040 --> 01:18:27.320]   Oh, we do, but we do.
[01:18:27.320 --> 01:18:28.680]   Be like this.
[01:18:28.680 --> 01:18:29.400]   You can hear me okay?
[01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:30.680]   I'm having me, yeah.
[01:18:30.680 --> 01:18:32.680]   It's a great tip.
[01:18:32.680 --> 01:18:36.120]   In fact, the visual really can be me demonstrating, as Gina does,
[01:18:36.120 --> 01:18:38.200]   talks about this feature of the week.
[01:18:38.200 --> 01:18:38.760]   How about that?
[01:18:38.760 --> 01:18:39.720]   Cool.
[01:18:39.720 --> 01:18:40.520]   Yeah, that sounds good.
[01:18:40.520 --> 01:18:45.640]   So Google+ launched the feature this week where you can share circles that you made.
[01:18:45.640 --> 01:18:46.200]   Yeah, baby.
[01:18:46.200 --> 01:18:46.200]   Yeah.
[01:18:46.200 --> 01:18:47.560]   I love this.
[01:18:47.560 --> 01:18:47.720]   Yeah.
[01:18:47.720 --> 01:18:48.440]   This is really neat.
[01:18:48.440 --> 01:18:54.440]   So if you build up, say, a circle of great photographers or fantastic twig guests or people
[01:18:54.440 --> 01:18:58.440]   who, you know, basically your own suggested user list, you can go into the circles.
[01:18:58.440 --> 01:19:00.120]   Leo, I can't see what you're doing.
[01:19:00.120 --> 01:19:01.000]   I'm doing it.
[01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:01.880]   I've gone into the circles.
[01:19:01.880 --> 01:19:02.360]   Okay.
[01:19:02.360 --> 01:19:05.880]   Gone into your circles area and you can drag and drop a circle into the top half of
[01:19:05.880 --> 01:19:06.840]   the screen.
[01:19:06.840 --> 01:19:10.680]   Or just click the share tag, which is on the circle as well.
[01:19:10.680 --> 01:19:11.720]   On the circle itself, right?
[01:19:11.720 --> 01:19:12.520]   There's a share link.
[01:19:12.520 --> 01:19:17.720]   So you click share and then you can write a comment saying, "Hey, this is my think up circle or my twig circle,"
[01:19:17.720 --> 01:19:19.720]   and then post it to your stream.
[01:19:19.720 --> 01:19:25.080]   And then other people can see that list of people on your circle and subscribe to it and see the people who are in it.
[01:19:25.080 --> 01:19:29.640]   They can circle people selectively or they can circle everyone in the circle.
[01:19:29.640 --> 01:19:32.440]   And the name of the circle is still private.
[01:19:32.440 --> 01:19:35.320]   And you're actually just publishing the circle as it is at the moment.
[01:19:35.320 --> 01:19:38.360]   Like if you change the circle afterward, your post doesn't change.
[01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:40.760]   So people are actually kind of forking the circle and making it.
[01:19:40.760 --> 01:19:42.040]   I just thought of a great game.
[01:19:42.040 --> 01:19:45.400]   You could create a circle and say, "Guess my label."
[01:19:45.400 --> 01:19:48.120]   That would be a really good game.
[01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:52.440]   Here's something that I didn't know, which probably all of you knew.
[01:19:52.440 --> 01:19:57.080]   But if you click add circle, what I was doing, which is crazy, is slowly one by one,
[01:19:57.080 --> 01:20:00.200]   selecting everybody from the circle, you don't need to do that.
[01:20:00.200 --> 01:20:04.440]   You nearly need to create to add to an existing circle.
[01:20:04.440 --> 01:20:09.160]   And then if you click the blue button, it will add everybody in this list automatically to the circle.
[01:20:09.160 --> 01:20:11.560]   So you don't have to do it one by one. You can do them all at once.
[01:20:11.560 --> 01:20:12.840]   You probably all knew that.
[01:20:12.840 --> 01:20:15.560]   But it took me about four or five times before I figured that sucker out.
[01:20:15.560 --> 01:20:19.880]   Someone in the chat room said that it's a follow Friday release too.
[01:20:19.880 --> 01:20:20.360]   Hopefully.
[01:20:20.360 --> 01:20:22.360]   It's a really good way to suggest users.
[01:20:22.360 --> 01:20:23.400]   I like it.
[01:20:23.400 --> 01:20:24.360]   There is a limit.
[01:20:24.360 --> 01:20:27.880]   Only 250 people per shared circle.
[01:20:27.880 --> 01:20:29.480]   So if you have a massive circle...
[01:20:29.480 --> 01:20:31.240]   I can hear Scoble crying now.
[01:20:31.240 --> 01:20:32.280]   Oh, that's how I found out.
[01:20:32.280 --> 01:20:34.280]   [laughter]
[01:20:34.280 --> 01:20:35.000]   Scoble went...
[01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.080]   [laughter]
[01:20:37.080 --> 01:20:37.480]   So...
[01:20:37.480 --> 01:20:39.400]   But I have immediately...
[01:20:39.400 --> 01:20:45.080]   I immediately went through all of the people who were sharing photography circles and added all the photographers.
[01:20:45.080 --> 01:20:46.920]   And it really does make a big difference.
[01:20:46.920 --> 01:20:51.480]   What's happened though is now my Google+ stream is very photograph heavy.
[01:20:51.480 --> 01:20:52.200]   I don't mind that.
[01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:56.760]   But it's made it really feel like Google+ is the place where photographers go to share.
[01:20:56.760 --> 01:20:58.520]   But that's fine.
[01:20:58.520 --> 01:21:00.920]   There is a search you can do.
[01:21:00.920 --> 01:21:04.360]   If you find a shared circle, you'll see there's a common text that Google puts
[01:21:04.360 --> 01:21:06.760]   every time in the share.
[01:21:06.760 --> 01:21:08.520]   I can't remember exactly what it was.
[01:21:08.520 --> 01:21:10.520]   It's something like shared circles with you.
[01:21:10.520 --> 01:21:11.640]   Shared a circle with you.
[01:21:11.640 --> 01:21:12.680]   Shared a circle with you.
[01:21:12.680 --> 01:21:14.520]   And that's how you can find all of them.
[01:21:14.520 --> 01:21:16.840]   Thanks to the new search.
[01:21:16.840 --> 01:21:17.720]   Thank goodness.
[01:21:17.720 --> 01:21:18.200]   Finally.
[01:21:18.200 --> 01:21:20.600]   Oh, ah!
[01:21:20.600 --> 01:21:21.880]   So smart.
[01:21:21.880 --> 01:21:22.280]   Yeah.
[01:21:22.280 --> 01:21:27.000]   So that's a very, very good way to find a lot of circles that people have shared.
[01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:30.280]   Oh, there was a cross-conquiry search.
[01:21:30.920 --> 01:21:32.120]   So you can search?
[01:21:32.120 --> 01:21:33.080]   Well, Jim.
[01:21:33.080 --> 01:21:33.560]   Oh, sorry.
[01:21:33.560 --> 01:21:34.360]   No, I just got an error.
[01:21:34.360 --> 01:21:35.640]   There was a problem performing your search.
[01:21:35.640 --> 01:21:36.440]   Please try again later.
[01:21:36.440 --> 01:21:38.200]   That's not what you expect to hear from Google.
[01:21:38.200 --> 01:21:38.680]   No.
[01:21:38.680 --> 01:21:39.000]   Ever.
[01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:39.160]   Wow.
[01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:39.640]   Wow.
[01:21:39.640 --> 01:21:40.360]   Anyway.
[01:21:40.360 --> 01:21:45.160]   My tool of the week is actually a product.
[01:21:45.160 --> 01:21:51.000]   I, you know, we're getting ready for the iPhone 5 to come out.
[01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:56.120]   And I thought while I still have the wherewithal before I have to buy an iPhone 5,
[01:21:56.120 --> 01:21:59.400]   I would try the new Samsung Galaxy S2.
[01:22:00.040 --> 01:22:07.240]   There are Galaxy S2s for every carrier except Verizon, which has used the Droid Bionic as its big screen
[01:22:07.240 --> 01:22:09.560]   Android phone.
[01:22:09.560 --> 01:22:12.440]   This is the Sprint version of the Galaxy S2.
[01:22:12.440 --> 01:22:18.840]   They call it unaccountably the Epic Touch 4G, but it is in fact a Galaxy S2.
[01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:22.200]   And I have to say, I love it that big screen.
[01:22:22.200 --> 01:22:24.360]   This is the 4.5 inch screen.
[01:22:24.360 --> 01:22:27.560]   Some of them have only a 4.3 inch screen.
[01:22:27.560 --> 01:22:31.320]   It actually makes everything very, very legible and clear.
[01:22:31.320 --> 01:22:35.160]   I'm using the TouchWiz interface.
[01:22:35.160 --> 01:22:38.440]   I think they've actually improved TouchWiz to the point where you might even want to use it.
[01:22:38.440 --> 01:22:41.560]   But of course, you could put other launchers on there as well.
[01:22:41.560 --> 01:22:44.680]   This is absolutely my favorite phone.
[01:22:44.680 --> 01:22:47.400]   And the image quality on here is spectacular.
[01:22:47.400 --> 01:22:54.200]   In fact, that's the second tool I wanted to share, which is a HD camera application that I found on
[01:22:54.200 --> 01:22:59.080]   Amazon's Android Web Store called HDR Camera Plus.
[01:22:59.080 --> 01:23:01.800]   And the images on this are spectacular.
[01:23:01.800 --> 01:23:08.440]   It takes three exposures, each of which is, I would guess, a couple of stops apart and then
[01:23:08.440 --> 01:23:11.800]   merges them together into stunning HDR very quickly.
[01:23:11.800 --> 01:23:16.920]   This is an HDR I just took this morning of John Slanina on our control tower.
[01:23:16.920 --> 01:23:18.760]   And it just really is lovely.
[01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:21.320]   I want to see it in Prey Radcliffe's hands fast.
[01:23:21.320 --> 01:23:24.360]   Oh, no, see, this is how you can be a Trey Radcliffe without Trey.
[01:23:24.360 --> 01:23:25.640]   I could be Trey, yeah, exactly.
[01:23:25.640 --> 01:23:29.720]   Because you don't have to-- this company that makes this Almelance does, in fact,
[01:23:29.720 --> 01:23:32.520]   make PC software for doing HDRs.
[01:23:32.520 --> 01:23:34.120]   But this does it all pretty automatically.
[01:23:34.120 --> 01:23:35.400]   There are settings within it.
[01:23:35.400 --> 01:23:37.000]   And it does a spectacular job.
[01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:42.600]   And that complements the already excellent A-megapixel camera in this phone.
[01:23:42.600 --> 01:23:44.440]   I really think this is a fantastic phone.
[01:23:44.440 --> 01:23:45.800]   I'm really excited.
[01:23:45.800 --> 01:23:49.160]   And I wonder when the iPhone 5 comes out next week.
[01:23:49.160 --> 01:23:54.120]   They say that they're vatted voice dictation, the new assistant, which is very similar.
[01:23:54.120 --> 01:23:57.640]   They're really going to be two things in the new iPhone that are straight out of Android.
[01:23:57.640 --> 01:23:59.640]   One is this dictation.
[01:23:59.640 --> 01:24:03.480]   And the other, of course, is the improved notifications system that looks exactly like
[01:24:03.480 --> 01:24:05.400]   the Android notification system.
[01:24:05.400 --> 01:24:07.720]   So we'll see what else iOS 5 can bring to the table.
[01:24:07.720 --> 01:24:11.000]   But for right now, I really love this phone.
[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:14.600]   This replaced the G2X, which I was using from LG on T-Mobile.
[01:24:14.600 --> 01:24:18.760]   Also, sprints the last company still offering an unlimited data plan.
[01:24:19.320 --> 01:24:20.200]   Yay, from them.
[01:24:20.200 --> 01:24:22.440]   I'm sure it's not long for this world.
[01:24:22.440 --> 01:24:24.760]   All right, that's my tool, Danny Sullivan.
[01:24:24.760 --> 01:24:27.720]   Anything you'd like to share as a tip trick tool tip?
[01:24:27.720 --> 01:24:30.040]   Yeah, this would be one of my own.
[01:24:30.040 --> 01:24:32.120]   You seem to like the periodic table of SEO.
[01:24:32.120 --> 01:24:32.840]   I loved that.
[01:24:32.840 --> 01:24:33.400]   I loved that.
[01:24:33.400 --> 01:24:35.560]   So I've got another one you might like.
[01:24:35.560 --> 01:24:37.880]   We did a little three minute video.
[01:24:37.880 --> 01:24:40.840]   And if you're at Search in Jelan, you got the home page,
[01:24:40.840 --> 01:24:42.840]   you'll see the top, we have the little navigation links.
[01:24:42.840 --> 01:24:43.960]   And one of those is SEO.
[01:24:43.960 --> 01:24:46.760]   When you go to that, you'll see that we've added a new movie.
[01:24:46.760 --> 01:24:48.600]   And we work with the people over at Common Craft.
[01:24:48.600 --> 01:24:49.800]   It's like three minutes long.
[01:24:49.800 --> 01:24:52.120]   And it's like, this is what SEO is.
[01:24:52.120 --> 01:24:55.400]   And it's not like, make sure you get your black hat stuff here.
[01:24:55.400 --> 01:24:57.480]   Make sure you're doing your link spamming there.
[01:24:57.480 --> 01:24:59.400]   It's like, this is how Search Engine is operated.
[01:24:59.400 --> 01:25:01.720]   These are the kind of main factors they look for.
[01:25:01.720 --> 01:25:04.360]   It's designed to be the kind of thing you could show to somebody
[01:25:04.360 --> 01:25:06.760]   who has no technical background at all.
[01:25:06.760 --> 01:25:09.800]   So they understand what's going on with all that sort of stuff.
[01:25:09.800 --> 01:25:11.160]   I love Common Craft.
[01:25:11.160 --> 01:25:12.680]   I think what they do is just great.
[01:25:12.680 --> 01:25:14.840]   They really are experts at explaining stuff.
[01:25:15.400 --> 01:25:17.080]   So it's a real pleasure to work with you.
[01:25:17.080 --> 01:25:20.760]   If you go to Search Engine land.com and you click the SEO link,
[01:25:20.760 --> 01:25:23.160]   you'll get, of course, this, which we talked about before,
[01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:25.240]   the periodic table of SEO ranking factors.
[01:25:25.240 --> 01:25:27.800]   And then this very clear, easy to understand,
[01:25:27.800 --> 01:25:28.760]   explanation of SEO.
[01:25:28.760 --> 01:25:29.800]   So the movie's up there.
[01:25:29.800 --> 01:25:32.760]   The other thing, by the way, I'll mention, and this isn't a new tool.
[01:25:32.760 --> 01:25:34.520]   I just always get surprised.
[01:25:34.520 --> 01:25:35.720]   Most people don't know about it.
[01:25:35.720 --> 01:25:38.360]   It's called doodle, D-L-O-D-L-E.com.
[01:25:38.360 --> 01:25:41.240]   And it is, if you've ever said, like,
[01:25:41.240 --> 01:25:45.240]   tried to schedule a call with more than like three people or two people.
[01:25:45.240 --> 01:25:46.520]   And you're emailing back and forth.
[01:25:46.520 --> 01:25:47.160]   Can we go here?
[01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:48.200]   Can we go there?
[01:25:48.200 --> 01:25:49.160]   You go online.
[01:25:49.160 --> 01:25:55.080]   You set up a time that are free for you or the time that you think everybody can do it.
[01:25:55.080 --> 01:25:56.680]   You can send everybody the URL.
[01:25:56.680 --> 01:25:57.560]   They can go through.
[01:25:57.560 --> 01:25:58.600]   They can add themselves.
[01:25:58.600 --> 01:25:59.800]   I can say, I can do it this time.
[01:25:59.800 --> 01:26:01.000]   Maybe I can do it that time.
[01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:01.560]   - This is great.
[01:26:01.560 --> 01:26:03.800]   - And it just makes getting together a snap.
[01:26:03.800 --> 01:26:05.960]   I wish they had a better name for the service,
[01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:08.040]   because I can never remember what it's called.
[01:26:08.040 --> 01:26:10.040]   But it would've been one of those essential things
[01:26:10.040 --> 01:26:13.800]   that use all the time when I got to try to find a call in time for everybody to paint.
[01:26:13.800 --> 01:26:14.280]   So.
[01:26:14.280 --> 01:26:14.600]   - Cool.
[01:26:14.600 --> 01:26:15.800]   - Has nothing to do with the title.
[01:26:15.800 --> 01:26:16.440]   - The URL.
[01:26:16.440 --> 01:26:17.640]   - Doodle.com.
[01:26:17.640 --> 01:26:18.440]   - Doodle.com.
[01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:19.400]   - D-O-O-D-L-E.
[01:26:19.400 --> 01:26:19.880]   - .com.
[01:26:19.880 --> 01:26:21.080]   - Yeah, I know it's a little strange.
[01:26:21.080 --> 01:26:22.920]   - Nothing to do with doodling.
[01:26:22.920 --> 01:26:26.840]   - Nothing to do with doodling, but it's still a great service.
[01:26:26.840 --> 01:26:28.680]   - Very good.
[01:26:28.680 --> 01:26:31.480]   And so much to have you on the show.
[01:26:31.480 --> 01:26:34.040]   Danny Sullivan is at Search Engine land.
[01:26:34.040 --> 01:26:35.640]   We always enjoy having you on.
[01:26:35.640 --> 01:26:36.440]   Thank you for being here.
[01:26:36.440 --> 01:26:37.160]   - It's great to be here.
[01:26:37.160 --> 01:26:40.680]   - By the way, people were asking it's HDR camera plus.
[01:26:40.680 --> 01:26:45.320]   There are a number of very similar programs, unfortunately, in the Android marketplace.
[01:26:45.320 --> 01:26:48.440]   This is the one that's from a company called Almelense.
[01:26:48.440 --> 01:26:56.520]   And it's the plus symbol, not the PLUS on here, 299.
[01:26:56.520 --> 01:26:57.800]   That's the program I was recommending.
[01:26:57.800 --> 01:27:01.080]   It's easily the best HDR program I've used.
[01:27:01.080 --> 01:27:03.560]   - And Leo, by the way, did you get Apple to finally let you go to the thing?
[01:27:03.560 --> 01:27:03.960]   I saw the--
[01:27:03.960 --> 01:27:04.520]   - No, no.
[01:27:04.520 --> 01:27:05.480]   - Really?
[01:27:05.480 --> 01:27:09.480]   I thought it was crazy because we don't hear from them either.
[01:27:09.480 --> 01:27:12.040]   But I kind of thought I'd be all right for me.
[01:27:12.040 --> 01:27:14.600]   I've been there that you're on the list.
[01:27:14.600 --> 01:27:20.520]   - In some ways, what he's talking about is the fact that ever since I streamed Steve Jobs,
[01:27:20.520 --> 01:27:25.080]   iPad announcement with my laptop pointed at Steve, I've not been--
[01:27:25.080 --> 01:27:26.040]   I don't know if it's related.
[01:27:26.040 --> 01:27:27.000]   They never said anything.
[01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:27.560]   They never called me.
[01:27:27.560 --> 01:27:28.760]   They never talked to me.
[01:27:28.760 --> 01:27:30.120]   But I would suspect it's related.
[01:27:30.120 --> 01:27:31.960]   I haven't been invited since to Apple events.
[01:27:31.960 --> 01:27:37.160]   And to be honest, in some ways, I kind of like it because then I could say,
[01:27:37.160 --> 01:27:38.600]   "See, I'm independent."
[01:27:38.600 --> 01:27:39.560]   - Yeah.
[01:27:39.560 --> 01:27:42.360]   - "No, they don't give me nothing."
[01:27:42.360 --> 01:27:43.640]   - But I do--
[01:27:43.640 --> 01:27:44.840]   I feel bad for our audience.
[01:27:44.840 --> 01:27:46.200]   We do cover all of those events.
[01:27:46.200 --> 01:27:49.400]   And we will, in fact, be covering Apple's October 4th announcement live.
[01:27:49.400 --> 01:27:51.720]   And we have plenty of people inside and outside the event.
[01:27:51.720 --> 01:27:53.400]   You can't really cover it from inside the event.
[01:27:53.400 --> 01:27:57.480]   You can't do the best job of covering it outside, watching all the live blogs.
[01:27:57.480 --> 01:28:01.880]   My real request to Apple, perhaps poorly couched, was,
[01:28:01.880 --> 01:28:05.800]   "Would you please stream the damn thing so that we can all watch it together?"
[01:28:06.680 --> 01:28:07.720]   That's what I would like.
[01:28:07.720 --> 01:28:09.800]   But--
[01:28:09.800 --> 01:28:11.720]   - Yeah, I wish Amazon had done that as well today.
[01:28:11.720 --> 01:28:13.240]   - Yeah, streaming is extremely--
[01:28:13.240 --> 01:28:13.960]   Thank you very much.
[01:28:13.960 --> 01:28:14.840]   How'd you find that?
[01:28:14.840 --> 01:28:17.720]   - Google search.
[01:28:17.720 --> 01:28:21.960]   Anyway, I don't care.
[01:28:21.960 --> 01:28:24.440]   I don't want to go so don't try to get me in there.
[01:28:24.440 --> 01:28:26.360]   I really just wish Apple would stream it.
[01:28:26.360 --> 01:28:30.760]   Because we actually do better coverage sitting here in our studios with correspondence out there
[01:28:30.760 --> 01:28:31.880]   and able to talk to people.
[01:28:31.880 --> 01:28:33.640]   That's what we did today with Amazon.
[01:28:33.640 --> 01:28:35.080]   That's what we did with F8 last week.
[01:28:35.080 --> 01:28:38.040]   And it's what we'll be doing October 4th, starting at 10 AM Pacific.
[01:28:38.040 --> 01:28:44.200]   That's 2 PM Eastern Time at Twit.tv on October 4th Tuesday.
[01:28:44.200 --> 01:28:47.000]   It will be a lead-in, of course, for Mac Break Weekly.
[01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:47.960]   Thank you, Jeff.
[01:28:47.960 --> 01:28:50.600]   Jeff Jarvis' new book, "Available Everywhere."
[01:28:50.600 --> 01:28:52.600]   - And thank you, Twiggers, for buying it.
[01:28:52.600 --> 01:28:55.960]   I'm very grateful when I see the tweets and the G-Pluses.
[01:28:55.960 --> 01:28:57.000]   And I'm very, very grateful.
[01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:57.320]   Thank you.
[01:28:57.320 --> 01:28:58.360]   And I want to hear what you think about that.
[01:28:58.360 --> 01:29:02.840]   - Yeah, and Eileen, let's book Jeff into triangulation so we can sit down and spend an hour talking about this.
[01:29:02.840 --> 01:29:04.200]   It's a very important issue.
[01:29:04.200 --> 01:29:08.520]   And obviously, you get a lot out of that when we talk on the show.
[01:29:08.520 --> 01:29:09.720]   But I'd like to get more.
[01:29:09.720 --> 01:29:12.440]   And then Gina Trapani of smarterware.org.
[01:29:12.440 --> 01:29:14.440]   We don't see you, but we know you're there.
[01:29:14.440 --> 01:29:15.720]   - The disembodied voice.
[01:29:15.720 --> 01:29:18.040]   Great show today.
[01:29:18.040 --> 01:29:19.080]   - Thanks for joining us.
[01:29:19.080 --> 01:29:20.200]   We really appreciate it.
[01:29:20.200 --> 01:29:21.320]   Thank you for joining us.
[01:29:21.320 --> 01:29:25.960]   We do this show on Wednesdays at 1 PM Pacific, 4 PM Eastern.
[01:29:25.960 --> 01:29:28.600]   That's 2,000 UTC at Twit.tv.
[01:29:28.600 --> 01:29:29.640]   Tune in live, if you will.
[01:29:29.640 --> 01:29:33.160]   But if you can't, don't forget we record audio and video and make it available to you
[01:29:33.160 --> 01:29:35.720]   almost immediately after the show on twit.tv.

[01:29:39.320 --> 01:29:40.040]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:29:40.040 --> 01:29:46.440]   We'll see you next time on This Week in Google and Facebook and Amazon and everything else.
[01:29:46.440 --> 01:29:56.440]   [MUSIC]
[01:29:56.440 --> 01:29:59.020]   (upbeat music)
