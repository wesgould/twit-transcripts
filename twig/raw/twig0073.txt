[00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.400]   Hello, Gina from Life Hacker.
[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.520]   Of course, many moons ago.
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.320]   Now smarter where.org.
[00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.080]   Howdy.
[00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.800]   Good to see you.
[00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:46.680]   And think up.
[00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:47.240]   Think tank.
[00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.740]   Think.
[00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:48.240]   Think up.
[00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.740]   Think up.
[00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:49.720]   Lead development on ThinkUp.
[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:50.920]   Think up app.com.
[00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.400]   Think up app.com.
[00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.720]   Also with us Jeff Jarvis from the City University of New York,
[00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.920]   where he teaches people journalistic integrity.
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.480]   I'm actually at home today.
[00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:05.880]   In his library.
[00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:06.800]   Yeah, how's that drawing?
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.120]   Now I'm looking all fuzzy jeans.
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.800]   You look good.
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.160]   Don't worry about it.
[00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.520]   A little pink.
[00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:13.480]   But that-- you probably--
[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.920]   I have a big light now on my desk.
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:16.440]   Oh, wow.
[00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.920]   Look at that.
[00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:17.440]   What is that?
[00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.280]   Wow.
[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.800]   And an umbrella.
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:20.300]   Yeah.
[00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:21.960]   I mean, I actually need to get the one you mentioned.
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.800]   I didn't get to the store.
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.840]   Is that like a regular umbrella or a special one?
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:26.560]   Yeah, it's a regular umbrella.
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.640]   No, it's a lighting umbrella.
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:29.440]   That's good.
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.680]   Well, no, you look very good.
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.000]   We should send a gaffer your way.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   I need--
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   because I want them to explain what the hell gaffer is.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.340]   I know.
[00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:38.280]   I just love the name.
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.080]   I like saying gaffer.
[00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.680]   Can they bring along a best boy?
[00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:42.040]   Yes.
[00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.600]   Now that sounds bad.
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.120]   Hey, gaffer.
[00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.720]   Also here, Joel Johnson, who is at gizmodo.com.
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:51.240]   And who?
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.800]   How's it going?
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:52.520]   Good to have you back.
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:53.280]   Now he's got a headset.
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.520]   He sounds so good.
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.840]   It do.
[00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:55.680]   It's amazing.
[00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.720]   Hey.
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.640]   And I want to thank--
[00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.120]   who hosted the show last week?
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.720]   Was it you, Jeff?
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:02.520]   Did you do all the work?
[00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.960]   No, no, no.
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:04.240]   Tom came in.
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.740]   Yep.
[00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:05.240]   Tom Aaron.
[00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.760]   Tom Aaron.
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:06.280]   Tom did.
[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.840]   Thank Tom for doing the yeoman duty
[00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.880]   while I was at Lou Webb with Marissa, me and Marissa,
[00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.000]   hanging.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.600]   She ignores me.
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.920]   I've met her twice now in the last week.
[00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.200]   And both times it was like--
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.080]   she just didn't--
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.840]   I don't think that registered.
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.240]   Was she surrounded by groupies or was it just like--
[00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.840]   Oh, actually.
[00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:28.840]   No, no.
[00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.880]   Well, the first time was at a restaurant in Paris
[00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.200]   where Louis could brought all the speakers.
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.000]   And then the second time was at Google's media party.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.600]   And both times nothing, really.
[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.200]   I don't think she's exactly, you know, missocial.
[00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.520]   I don't think she's that sociable.
[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:45.480]   No, I don't think she is.
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:46.640]   I think that's her.
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:47.840]   Oh.
[00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:48.840]   I think she's got a little bit of knowledge.
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.800]   She's been sibble to me and nice and decent.
[00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:51.000]   She's--
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.400]   No, no.
[00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.600]   I wouldn't say if she was on sibble.
[00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:53.880]   She just wasn't particularly--
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.280]   She doesn't start telling jokes and--
[00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:56.240]   No conversation.
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.800]   And yet I had some great conversations
[00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.440]   with the like Google's chief economist Hal Varian.
[00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.280]   Oh, there's some smart people at Google with--
[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.720]   Yeah.
[00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.720]   Isn't that amazing?
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.160]   That was a very interesting thing to go to.
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:13.160]   And Larry was there and Eric was there.
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.360]   But I had the most fun talking to like--
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.880]   Well, her replacement, Udi, who's doing search now
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.240]   with Mike Cohen, who is their voice guy, who
[00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:24.760]   does all the voice recognition.
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.600]   That was a fascinating conversation.
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:27.680]   I bet that was really good.
[00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:29.320]   Yeah, really interesting.
[00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:30.760]   So we're going to get many of those people
[00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:32.400]   on the show in the future.
[00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.200]   I also talked to--
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:37.760]   Oh, and I can't remember his name.
[00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:38.880]   Shoot.
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.440]   To the guy responsible for this, the Chrome OS.
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:44.800]   And we had a very good conversation
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.360]   because I tell you, I--
[00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.000]   Pardon me?
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.920]   His name is on the dock.
[00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:50.920]   Wow.
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.120]   Eileen is-- oh, yeah.
[00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.960]   Sundar Pachai.
[00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:54.960]   Eileen's on the ball, man.
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:55.800]   I love Eileen.
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.280]   Well, she was standing right next to me.
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:57.720]   Thank you.
[00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:58.280]   She's awesome.
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:58.280]   I thought.
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.280]   Sundar and I had a conversation because I
[00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:01.240]   have the CR48.
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:02.440]   This is the--
[00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.920]   And Google said it's very specifically,
[00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.400]   don't review the hardware.
[00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.960]   This is just a-- this is not even a reference platform.
[00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.040]   It's a thing that we sent you.
[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:13.520]   So I'm not going to review the hardware.
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.280]   There's some interesting stuff.
[00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.040]   For instance, no caps lock key.
[00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.680]   They put a search button on there instead.
[00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.120]   I think that's kind of cool.
[00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:20.440]   Yeah.
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:22.880]   Can I say that I actually think the hardware is fantastic?
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:23.920]   Do you like it?
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.360]   I think the hardware is so--
[00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.800]   we got one of those into the office in New York this week
[00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.120]   or last week, I guess it was.
[00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.800]   And everybody was just fawning over.
[00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.000]   It's like the anti-macbook.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   It's got a lot of the same clean lines,
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.440]   but there's no logos anywhere.
[00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.000]   There's no stupid windows, stickers.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.280]   It's very black helicopter.
[00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.800]   You feel like there'd be no radar signature.
[00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.640]   It's like what a think pad wants to be,
[00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.840]   but they've kind of gone off message.
[00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:52.720]   It's got a VGA port.
[00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:53.200]   It's generic.
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:56.160]   I'm sure they had somebody's generic hardware design.
[00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:57.480]   It's running Debian.
[00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:01.080]   And then on top of Debian, it's exactly what Gina, what
[00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:01.840]   we had talked about.
[00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.440]   It's just Chrome.
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:04.600]   Instant on, I like that.
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.640]   You saw how fast that turns on.
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:07.520]   Boots very quickly.
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:09.200]   It's a small solid-state drive, I think.
[00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.520]   Was it 16 gigs, Joel?
[00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:11.600]   I can't remember.
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:12.240]   Yeah, I don't remember.
[00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:13.760]   It's very small.
[00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:17.840]   You log in with your Google account, which is amazing.
[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:18.800]   Very Android-like.
[00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:19.680]   Very Android-like.
[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:20.880]   And all you get is a browser.
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.160]   In fact, this is the conversation that I have.
[00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:26.960]   I said, Sundar, explain to me, I have Chrome on my, let's say,
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.840]   MacBook Air.
[00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:31.600]   And when I can go to the Chrome App Store,
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.040]   I can install the same exact things.
[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:35.000]   It syncs up.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.120]   If I filled the screen with Chrome on my air,
[00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:40.000]   it'd be identical to this.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.800]   But then, if I want more, I've got it.
[00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:47.080]   Why would somebody voluntarily say, well, I don't want more,
[00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:48.000]   or I'll never want more.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:48.920]   I just want a browser.
[00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:50.040]   Because that's all this is, really.
[00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:51.880]   It's just a browser.
[00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:58.560]   And his point was simplicity, security.
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:02.120]   He said, some people don't want complexity.
[00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:05.560]   And then I thought maybe if they sold it really cheap.
[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:06.560]   That's what I'm--
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.920]   Do you think it'll be subsidized?
[00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:11.080]   I mean, if you think the hardware platform is going
[00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:15.600]   to be pretty stable for what it takes to run Chrome OS,
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:18.040]   that's not going to change a whole lot over the next years.
[00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:22.520]   So a $50 Chrome OS laptop is not out of the question,
[00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:23.560]   by any means.
[00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:25.000]   And I can understand it.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.280]   Because you get what you pay for, right?
[00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:30.320]   So you get a little bit less, but you're not paying for it.
[00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:32.800]   I think why not give it away?
[00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:35.360]   It has 3G and Wi-Fi.
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:37.680]   And it comes with-- and apparently, it's
[00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:39.560]   even any commercial version they sell
[00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:42.760]   is going to come with $100 a month, a month, a month,
[00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:45.160]   a bandwidth free.
[00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:49.160]   Is that so smart to finally go to an upsell and usage?
[00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:50.800]   I get that.
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:52.920]   What do you mean, upsell?
[00:07:52.920 --> 00:07:55.120]   For our freemium model.
[00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:58.080]   Take the free and get used to it and get addicted and then
[00:07:58.080 --> 00:07:58.560]   buy more.
[00:07:58.560 --> 00:07:59.560]   Oh, it is an upsell, true.
[00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:01.520]   Because 100 megabytes ain't going to get you very fast.
[00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:03.760]   No, it's OK, very far at all.
[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:05.480]   In that sense, it is an upsell.
[00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:08.400]   Well, I wonder whether this is also
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:12.800]   kind of a proof of concept for browser as world.
[00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:16.000]   That even if you don't buy this machine or have this machine,
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.600]   it makes them build everything-- everything
[00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:19.280]   into the browser.
[00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:21.040]   So you don't need any nails.
[00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:22.920]   And yeah, if you have the machine
[00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:25.440]   fine, if you don't, the same difference.
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:26.240]   There's some issues.
[00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:27.680]   It's Debian under the hood.
[00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:30.320]   If you look very closely at the font rendering,
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:32.440]   it's not very attractive.
[00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:34.280]   Do control Alt T, Leo.
[00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:36.120]   That's kind of cool, isn't it?
[00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:37.960]   Yeah, that Croche shell.
[00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:40.440]   It's a very, very, very simple shell.
[00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:41.120]   So you can SSH.
[00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:43.280]   So you do have a little bit of a command line there.
[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:44.200]   But not much.
[00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:45.200]   Not much.
[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:46.200]   Not much.
[00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:48.160]   There's no-- there's none of the Linux or Unix
[00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:49.680]   applications you'd expect.
[00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:51.600]   There's SSH.
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:52.080]   Right.
[00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:53.680]   So you'd want to just SSH somewhere
[00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:54.600]   where you did have a full--
[00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:55.280]   I guess so.
[00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:56.080]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:57.360]   I'm glad that they have that, actually.
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:58.600]   I don't know.
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:00.800]   Do you think that that's going to be part of the final Chrome OS
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:03.280]   or is that just for this?
[00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:06.040]   Well, the final Chrome OS, there was talk of that remote desktop
[00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:07.720]   feature, that chromoting feature, right?
[00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:11.080]   Where are you supposed to be able to get into remote machines?
[00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:12.800]   And the way that I envisioned it, the way
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:15.000]   I think it was described, was that it was going to be like a
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.800]   remote desktop window inside a browser tab.
[00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:18.560]   It's not ready yet.
[00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:21.880]   So I think that this shell is kind of another way to give
[00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:26.040]   kind of geeks early adopters a way to get into a remote server.
[00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:29.480]   Last show, I was saying how I didn't see how a software
[00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:33.240]   developer could work on a Chrome OS machine full time.
[00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:35.960]   They said hundreds of Googlers were using their CR48 full time.
[00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:37.120]   And I said, how was this happening?
[00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:40.200]   And a Googler said to me, all of our code compilation and
[00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:44.760]   testing and code hosting happens in the internal cloud.
[00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:47.840]   And we access it through Chrome.
[00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:52.320]   So I think that they provided that shell just so that the
[00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:54.040]   prototype testers could have the beginning to that.
[00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:54.840]   That makes sense.
[00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:55.600]   Yeah, that makes sense.
[00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.840]   If they're saying we're going to sell this to grandma because
[00:09:57.840 --> 00:10:02.880]   she doesn't want complexity having a SSH is not a selling point.
[00:10:02.880 --> 00:10:04.920]   But grandma's never going to hit control alt T.
[00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:07.680]   Well, if she does, she's going to call my radio show saying,
[00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:08.480]   what happened?
[00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:10.240]   It's a liver set.
[00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:11.760]   And it's saying, croche.
[00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:12.360]   What is that?
[00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:13.040]   And croche?
[00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:14.440]   What does that mean?
[00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:17.080]   I don't even think that that shortcut shows up on the
[00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:18.960]   control alt slash.
[00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:19.560]   I don't think so.
[00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:20.160]   Keepward.
[00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:20.760]   Yeah.
[00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:22.000]   So they kind of hid that there.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:22.320]   Just yeah.
[00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:25.040]   But it wouldn't be so hard to accidentally hit those keys and
[00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:26.280]   go, what the hell happened?
[00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:27.240]   It just happened, right?
[00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:28.080]   Right.
[00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:29.040]   It doesn't.
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:31.040]   It doesn't say, oh, you do.
[00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:32.440]   So I have a feeling this is not fine.
[00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:33.920]   That will not be in the final.
[00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:35.680]   I can't imagine that'll be in the final.
[00:10:35.680 --> 00:10:37.480]   So is this not going to come out until next year?
[00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:38.520]   That's not future will be.
[00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:39.160]   Yeah.
[00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:40.160]   No, we don't know.
[00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:43.720]   They say Samsung possibly will be making some sort of
[00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:44.560]   device with this.
[00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:47.440]   Samsung seems to love Google these days.
[00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:48.000]   We'll talk about another--
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.280]   Samsung, yeah, they still do have a heavy OEM business.
[00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:54.560]   I think the most exciting thing about these though is that
[00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:59.000]   it seems like Google's web apps development has kind of
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.640]   stagnated in some ways.
[00:11:00.640 --> 00:11:03.320]   It's been a long time since I've really been wowed on the
[00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:05.960]   web app side of things, not on the data side of things.
[00:11:05.960 --> 00:11:09.320]   So them eating their own dog food for a while and running up
[00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:11.240]   into the problems of like, well, what do I do if I want a
[00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:12.560]   video editor that's web based?
[00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:14.880]   Or what do I do if I want all of this stuff?
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:17.920]   I think even if the Chrome OS platform isn't super
[00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:21.800]   successful, it might push Google to start really pushing
[00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:23.320]   the envelope again on web apps.
[00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:25.760]   There is some skepticism.
[00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:27.160]   I'm not the only skeptic.
[00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:29.920]   To me, it seems like unless they can make this free or
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:32.800]   very close to free, there's not much of a market for such a
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:33.800]   stripped down device.
[00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:36.440]   Since I can get all the functionality in any other
[00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:41.000]   computer that runs Chrome, Paul Buhight, who created
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:46.640]   Gmail for Google, sold Friend Feed to Facebook and just
[00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:50.360]   recently left Facebook famously tweeted a couple of days ago,
[00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:56.200]   tweeted a couple of days ago, that he thought Google would
[00:11:56.200 --> 00:12:01.160]   only have one OS, that ultimately this was doomed by the
[00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:03.240]   end of the next year.
[00:12:03.240 --> 00:12:04.920]   >> Well, that's been the question forever, is why is
[00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:06.920]   their Chrome OS and why is their Android?
[00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:10.240]   And so we're at least seeing Chrome OS now and getting to
[00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:12.080]   play with it and having some notion of it.
[00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:15.680]   But, you know, however, tens of millions of Android units are
[00:12:15.680 --> 00:12:18.240]   already out there and now you've got the Galaxy tab and it's
[00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:20.680]   going to move to tablets and kind of move into this same
[00:12:20.680 --> 00:12:22.480]   weird space that Chrome OS is at.
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:27.920]   So, yeah, I don't think it's necessarily going to exist in
[00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:31.400]   the way that it exists now is the sole OS of a laptop.
[00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:32.720]   But, you know, they could do the same thing.
[00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:35.520]   There was a couple of companies, actually, a couple of
[00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:39.200]   years ago that were using really light Linux environments as
[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:42.640]   like an alternate boot, like you could just hit a button and
[00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:45.520]   have an instant on in a Windows laptop or whatever.
[00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:48.600]   So I could see Chrome being something like that where,
[00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:51.200]   you know, you have a full blown laptop but you don't need to
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:51.960]   use it for everything.
[00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:55.120]   You just need a web browser and so you boot into Chrome OS as
[00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:57.040]   opposed to Windows or OS 10 or whatever.
[00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:02.600]   It is also just part of Google's master plan to get us all
[00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:04.440]   connected all the time everywhere.
[00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:07.400]   And if you're not on and can't afford it, this might argue
[00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:09.560]   against the notion of the digital divide.
[00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:13.480]   And if you could get this thing down to 50 bucks, that's
[00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:15.560]   pretty compelling or in a school.
[00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:18.560]   This is like this is like the OLPC, really.
[00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:19.640]   Right.
[00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:20.720]   Bingo.
[00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:22.960]   And I think, I think Jeff's point earlier that this is
[00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:23.520]   proof of concept.
[00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:27.120]   This is Google proving to consumers that all you need is
[00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:27.600]   the browser.
[00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:29.160]   I mean, I sort of agree with Paul.
[00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:31.840]   I can see down the road that Chrome will be ported to
[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:34.400]   Android and will get full Chrome on Android with extensions
[00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:36.440]   and with web apps and you'll be able to, you know, pay
[00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:39.400]   web, you mean, I mean, the Chrome OS introduces the app
[00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:42.560]   store, which is a way for web developers to get paid for
[00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:43.120]   their work, right?
[00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:45.600]   So this is going to jumpstart the developer community, prove to
[00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:47.640]   consumers that all you need is a web browser.
[00:13:47.880 --> 00:13:51.600]   Eventually, once Chrome gets, you know, full Chrome gets on
[00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:54.560]   Android, I could see maybe them killing Chrome OS and just it
[00:13:54.560 --> 00:13:55.480]   just being Android.
[00:13:55.480 --> 00:13:58.080]   And so, you know, Chrome OS is just Android starting up quickly
[00:13:58.080 --> 00:13:59.040]   and running the browser.
[00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:02.480]   But Android doesn't have that super fast startup speed yet.
[00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:04.720]   And I don't think consumers are convinced that all they need
[00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:05.160]   is a browser.
[00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:08.040]   Or at least I'm not consumers, but I don't, I wasn't convinced
[00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:10.120]   that of all the stuff that I could do in a web browser.
[00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:12.520]   And having this year for 48 definitely made me go like,
[00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:15.320]   Oh, OK, there's a lot more here than I realized there is.
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:16.800]   Although I haven't been able to switch full time.
[00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:18.560]   I mean, we're on Skype now, right?
[00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:20.360]   And I needed a full machine to do that.
[00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:23.240]   You can make video calls.
[00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:24.920]   It has a G talk and then she talked about it.
[00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:26.760]   It comes with a camera and a microphone.
[00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:28.200]   We have to switch to G talk.
[00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:30.440]   We should all just use CR 48 from now on.
[00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:33.080]   If you don't have a CR 48, you can't do the show.
[00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:36.280]   By the way, when I first got it, I said, Oh, that must be the
[00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:38.400]   periodic table of the elements number four.
[00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:39.360]   Chrome, it's not.
[00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:40.480]   Chrome is 24.
[00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:43.920]   CR 48 is an unstable isotope of Chrome.
[00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:47.160]   Of crying.
[00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:50.000]   Chromium isotope is an unstable.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.880]   So again, with the geek, you know, these guys, can you store things
[00:14:54.880 --> 00:14:57.080]   and work offline on this machine?
[00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:58.040]   No, absolutely.
[00:14:58.040 --> 00:14:58.600]   It doesn't.
[00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:00.040]   Or can you, Gina?
[00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:00.600]   You can.
[00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:04.000]   There's a there's a slot for a camera card you can put in.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.680]   You can you can plug in a USB drive.
[00:15:05.680 --> 00:15:06.760]   You can you can browse files.
[00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:08.880]   So if you go to Flickr, for example, and say upload file,
[00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:10.160]   you can browse the hard drive.
[00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:12.400]   You can take a screenshot by doing control.
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:13.080]   I think it's control.
[00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:16.760]   There's also screenshot extensions to.
[00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:20.280]   Yeah, but but that will save the screenshot to the the disk.
[00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:21.320]   But where is it?
[00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:22.720]   Because you can't find it.
[00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:26.320]   You you don't have access to if if you go to like if you go to Gmail
[00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:29.920]   and say attach file, it will open up a dialogue box, which will browse the
[00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:32.320]   which will browse the hard drive and you can also browse the USB drive.
[00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:33.680]   And the and there's a camera.
[00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:37.040]   So it's like the iPad in that sense where it has no real it has a file
[00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:38.920]   system, but no real user access to it.
[00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:42.400]   The pro you requires a program that's knowledgeable about it.
[00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:46.080]   I mean, right, you have to have a web app that triggers an open open file
[00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:47.760]   dialogue and it's it's really ugly.
[00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:49.400]   You can you browse in the open file.
[00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:52.040]   I mean, can you go up and down and yeah, you can go up and down.
[00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:54.200]   You can see the different this if you have a USB drive plugged in.
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:55.160]   You'll see it.
[00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:58.240]   So I have my email stored on that device.
[00:15:58.240 --> 00:16:00.880]   I mean, because of my Android, you know, I'm a I'm a Galaxy tab.
[00:16:00.880 --> 00:16:02.600]   I've got my email on your offline.
[00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:03.440]   Right.
[00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:04.560]   Because you're off line email.
[00:16:04.560 --> 00:16:06.040]   I don't even know.
[00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:09.080]   I well, you know, I don't think that Gmail supports offline anymore
[00:16:09.080 --> 00:16:12.280]   because they pulled gears, but I'm but I'm pretty sure that I know
[00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:14.040]   that the plan is to to work.
[00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:14.880]   I can do that.
[00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:15.880]   Five.
[00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:17.960]   Yeah, and we'll download your mail.
[00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:19.400]   Right, right.
[00:16:19.400 --> 00:16:23.280]   But I think this is going to be all HTML five offline storage, right.
[00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:26.160]   So it's not an airplane machine.
[00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:27.640]   Yeah.
[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:31.520]   Well, this is the thing that I think once the web apps mature to the point
[00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:35.120]   where they're all using HTML five offline storage, then sure you could, you
[00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:38.480]   know, I mean, I think ideally once this does actually get released, you'll be
[00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:41.800]   able to edit documents and check email and all the all the apps that you use
[00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:45.840]   offline storage because the apps can either be just a wrapper that points to a
[00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:48.920]   hosted version, which is just like a basically a glorified book market, or it
[00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:52.760]   can be the app can be bundled, you know, all the JS and JavaScript and HTML, you
[00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:57.080]   know, markup can be bundled up into one file that you download and that stores,
[00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:59.360]   you know, that you actually store on the machine itself.
[00:16:59.360 --> 00:17:02.160]   So they are kind of like offline web apps.
[00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:05.800]   I found this frustrating to use in a way that I don't find the iPad frustrating to
[00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:08.080]   use. And maybe it's because it has a computer form factor.
[00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:10.480]   And you just kind of say, well, it's kind of keyboard.
[00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:12.040]   I mean, this should be a computer.
[00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:16.200]   If it were a tablet, though, maybe, well, but it is not, that's there's where you
[00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:16.840]   have Android.
[00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:21.480]   By the way, one of the things that Sundar said, and I think this is true, is it
[00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:22.800]   is a much more secure.
[00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:24.720]   Um, that does it does.
[00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:25.440]   Yeah.
[00:17:25.440 --> 00:17:29.880]   The, and you know, if people really got skittish about security, that might push
[00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:31.120]   them in a direction of something like this.
[00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:36.800]   It does, um, it does a hash on the firmware and on the system files, if they're
[00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:41.640]   modified, it fixes them, it doesn't, you know, it's a big deal to change any of
[00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:42.920]   the system or firmware stuff.
[00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:44.440]   Automatic updates.
[00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:46.480]   He, he said, you sell that as a big point.
[00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:48.960]   He said, you know, you don't have to ever think about updates.
[00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:53.120]   Everything sandboxed, every tab is sandboxed as is in Chrome, but also the
[00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:55.000]   reader and the flash player are sandboxed.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.160]   He says eventually everything will be sandboxed and Chrome OS.
[00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:03.560]   So it is a fundamental, something written from the ground up to be fundamentally
[00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:04.040]   secure.
[00:18:04.040 --> 00:18:04.960]   Yeah.
[00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:06.280]   The, the updates are great.
[00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:09.040]   I mean, I think I got updates twice and it was just a little thing that said, Hey,
[00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:13.080]   restart, you've got updates and you reached, you know, the restart process is
[00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:14.800]   only a few seconds and I just kept going.
[00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:17.040]   It restored my tabs and it was like nothing happened.
[00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:20.160]   You know, when you think about the pain that is, you know, windows update and
[00:18:20.160 --> 00:18:24.740]   even iOS 10 update, it's like, uh, watch a progress bar, reboot, the
[00:18:24.740 --> 00:18:25.520]   spinny thing.
[00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:26.200]   It was none of that.
[00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:26.560]   Right.
[00:18:26.560 --> 00:18:27.080]   It's cool.
[00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:30.440]   Also, so, you know, the argument has been for a long time that a computer should
[00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:32.840]   be as easy to operate as a mixer.
[00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:34.160]   Right.
[00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:37.360]   A toaster or refrigerator that we don't think about those things.
[00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:41.040]   Is this, does this herald that?
[00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:46.760]   Yeah, you know, I have this like really high expectation of it being like turning
[00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:50.040]   my TV on really fast, boot up and it, it isn't quite that.
[00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:50.400]   Right.
[00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:51.360]   I mean, it is a few seconds.
[00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:53.640]   I mean, it's, I think it's maybe about, I haven't timed it.
[00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:56.360]   I think it's about 10 seconds or maybe eight to 10 seconds, which there's a
[00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:57.000]   little bit of a boot.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:00.240]   I mean, from a full off, but I mean, full off, you, who would you, but you
[00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:01.840]   don't really turn it off ever though, right?
[00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:02.960]   I mean, the whole idea is it.
[00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:03.760]   Right.
[00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:04.520]   You sleep it, right?
[00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:05.760]   But I have it set, I have it set up.
[00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:06.880]   So I sign in every time I sleep.
[00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:10.040]   So, you know, you sign in and then it takes, at least for me, because I've got a lot
[00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:11.120]   of wireless networks around me.
[00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:12.400]   It takes, it takes a couple of seconds.
[00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:12.600]   Right.
[00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:13.280]   Start counting.
[00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:13.640]   Ready?
[00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:16.040]   I'm going to, I'm going to, this is full shutdown.
[00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:16.680]   Ready?
[00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:21.960]   And three, two, one, one thousand, two, one thousand, three, one thousand, four, one thousand.
[00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:22.680]   This is good radio.
[00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:23.640]   Five, one thousand.
[00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:24.680]   There's the Chrome logo.
[00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:27.640]   Six, one thousand, seven, one thousand, eight, one thousand.
[00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:29.240]   Of course, I have to get to the login.
[00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:32.720]   Can you bypass that login and have it automatically go right in?
[00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:34.200]   10, 11, there it goes.
[00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:34.800]   That was pretty cool.
[00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:35.280]   You're right, Gina.
[00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:37.280]   That's not, that's not instant though.
[00:19:37.280 --> 00:19:37.600]   Yeah.
[00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:38.960]   It was like 13 to 14.
[00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:40.520]   You know, I hate to say it.
[00:19:40.520 --> 00:19:42.920]   And this is what this is what I showed Sundar said.
[00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:44.640]   Look, I got a MacBook Air.
[00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:45.440]   It's got Chrome on it.
[00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:46.560]   It boots just as fast.
[00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:48.520]   It's got full storage.
[00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:49.480]   It's got an operandism.
[00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:53.360]   It's got a, you know, they said, but you're comparing it to, you know, kind of like the
[00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:54.840]   creme de la creme of notebooks.
[00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:57.600]   Not everybody's going to want or kind of forward a MacBook Air.
[00:19:57.600 --> 00:19:58.400]   Right.
[00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:00.560]   But you, you still run, you have the Rime Time machine.
[00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:01.520]   You're running carbonite.
[00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:03.120]   I mean, you've got to worry about backing up your stuff.
[00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:04.960]   You have to worry about keeping things updated.
[00:20:04.960 --> 00:20:07.800]   You're getting, you're getting notifications that iTunes has another update.
[00:20:07.800 --> 00:20:11.240]   I just got one right before the show and it's actually blinking at me now.
[00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:13.280]   So there's that, there's that in convenience.
[00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:14.560]   I'm not, I'm not defending this.
[00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:15.040]   You are 48.
[00:20:15.040 --> 00:20:15.840]   I think there are problems with it.
[00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:18.800]   I'm not, I wasn't able to use it full time, but I, but I do think that there's not,
[00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:20.520]   there's an argument for this kind of thing.
[00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:23.160]   I think it's really just the network, you know, the, the network market.
[00:20:23.160 --> 00:20:24.160]   I'd much rather get a network.
[00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:26.160]   By the way is dead as far as I'm concerned.
[00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:27.160]   I think the net book, right?
[00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:28.000]   What do you think, Joel?
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:33.280]   I mean, you see this is that is, it seemed to me the net book was a fad.
[00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:37.320]   It was the hula hoop of the year 2009.
[00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:42.360]   Well, I mean, I think a lot of people did what I did, which was buy a couple and,
[00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:44.760]   you know, play around with it, try to find the operating system.
[00:20:44.760 --> 00:20:49.560]   I liked best for it and then realize, you know, the keyboards aren't very good.
[00:20:49.560 --> 00:20:49.840]   They're cheesy.
[00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:51.000]   It's cheesy.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:51.400]   Yeah.
[00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:56.000]   I mean, they're really nice, but, but everything seems like it's fracturing, right?
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.760]   Like the instead of, you know, everybody's like, oh, the iPad's going to be the future
[00:20:59.760 --> 00:21:00.400]   of computing.
[00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:02.960]   And it's like, well, yeah, for some people it is.
[00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:05.840]   And like the, the CR 48 is going to be the future of computing.
[00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:06.760]   And that's not.
[00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:07.520]   Yeah, I guess you're right.
[00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:08.320]   It's a fragmented.
[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:09.440]   People fragmented market.
[00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:10.040]   Yeah.
[00:21:10.040 --> 00:21:10.520]   Yeah.
[00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:16.080]   I mean, I feel like it's, you know, back back in the day to make a always, you know,
[00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:20.000]   perilous car connection, you know, you had a car and you had a truck.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.600]   And then they had a few different cars and then they had a few different trucks.
[00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:27.920]   And then they had big trucks and like computing seems like at this point, it's just going
[00:21:27.920 --> 00:21:32.480]   wider and wider and wider and where there is a couple million units here.
[00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:33.680]   And that's a success for somebody.
[00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:35.400]   And there's a couple million units there.
[00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:41.480]   But even the fact that we're considering like an iPad and an iPhone to be fundamentally
[00:21:41.480 --> 00:21:46.800]   different experiences when they're so close to being almost identical, it's pretty,
[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:47.920]   you know, pretty important.
[00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:52.600]   But I do think that this pretty much will end up nuking netbooks.
[00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:56.320]   If you're not paying for any hardware, I mean, like if the hardware and all of that
[00:21:56.320 --> 00:22:00.440]   stuff ends up being 99 bucks, like these are the kind of things I could see rolling
[00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:05.000]   into doing a project somewhere and stopping by the store and buying 10 of them.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.120]   And, you know, handing them out to people.
[00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:11.440]   And then when they're done, you know, take them with you or whatever, like it's
[00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:16.120]   the point where computing hardware becomes almost disposable with all of the, you
[00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:20.040]   know, problems that entails, you know, I would worry too about, I think people are
[00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:24.160]   going to, the first time the Google goes down for half a day and all of their
[00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:25.360]   stuff is inaccessible.
[00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:28.680]   It's going to, that's going to happen.
[00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:29.840]   They will happen, right?
[00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:30.520]   It will happen.
[00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:31.440]   Right.
[00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:33.040]   But again, I go back to Android.
[00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:38.200]   I, on my Galaxy tab, I have my email offline.
[00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:39.480]   Not on this.
[00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:42.800]   I'm a Gmail, but I think if they do it on one, they can do it on the other.
[00:22:42.800 --> 00:22:45.560]   It's not, it's not out of out of the ball.
[00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:47.320]   But I don't think this is, I think they could do it.
[00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:48.480]   But I think that they choose not to.
[00:22:48.480 --> 00:22:50.800]   This is a, this is, you know, it's got two gigs of RAM.
[00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:52.400]   It's got a tiny SSD in it.
[00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:54.040]   Uh, it's common.
[00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:55.520]   We're going to just like basics.
[00:22:55.520 --> 00:23:00.200]   Light, Gina said a lot of that is, is like this close to being there, you know,
[00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:04.480]   the fact that they had gears and pulled it back was really more just a, let's make
[00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:07.640]   sure we do this all on a, on an open standard and an open platform that everybody
[00:23:07.640 --> 00:23:08.120]   can use.
[00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:12.960]   So within another year or two, I would say that all of those apps are going to be
[00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:14.280]   very robust offline.
[00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:18.080]   Well, you know, and to answer the question about two O S is, I think it's
[00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:19.080]   perfectly reasonable.
[00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:22.800]   What Eric Schmidt said this, we talked about a couple of weeks ago for touch.
[00:23:22.800 --> 00:23:26.720]   We have Android for a standard kind of more computing with a keyboard.
[00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:28.200]   We have Chrome OS.
[00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:29.960]   I mean, that's not unreasonable.
[00:23:29.960 --> 00:23:32.560]   Microsoft had multiple operating systems for years.
[00:23:32.560 --> 00:23:33.520]   It's not unheard of.
[00:23:33.520 --> 00:23:35.240]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:39.680]   That still felt like a big kind of Schmidt finally found a way to explain
[00:23:39.680 --> 00:23:42.240]   why they had two O S projects going at the same time.
[00:23:42.240 --> 00:23:43.160]   Like what is Yahoo?
[00:23:43.160 --> 00:23:43.560]   Yeah.
[00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:43.960]   Yeah.
[00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:48.280]   Well, but Gina, back to your TV analogy, I'm going to play with that for a second.
[00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:53.880]   This looks more sensible to operate than my cable box and remote control.
[00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:57.400]   It's a lot better than the Logitech review.
[00:23:57.400 --> 00:23:58.040]   I'll give you that.
[00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:03.680]   It beats Google TV all up and up and down the.
[00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:06.440]   It's it's a dead simple computer, right?
[00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:10.120]   So for people who don't like the complexity of computers, or didn't weren't even
[00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:12.720]   really aware of how complex, you know, full computers are.
[00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:16.560]   But the CRF 48 definitely makes you go like, Oh, yeah, I never touch the function keys.
[00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:17.360]   I don't need those.
[00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:19.680]   Oh, yeah, the caps lock key stupid anyway.
[00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:25.440]   And and oh, yeah, I just basically boot up my machine and open my browser anyway.
[00:24:25.440 --> 00:24:26.680]   And this just does it for me.
[00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:32.600]   So I think that this is just about Google showing people like this is, you know, living
[00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:36.080]   living your life in the cloud or working in the cloud all day long is definitely
[00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:36.760]   a possibility.
[00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:38.520]   And not everybody likes that.
[00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:40.440]   Richard Stalman doesn't.
[00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:41.000]   Right.
[00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:42.560]   He doesn't like a lot of things.
[00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:43.800]   Well, he has like a lot of things.
[00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:44.120]   Yeah.
[00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:45.920]   Let's let's take a break.
[00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:49.520]   I want to come back and by the way, I do want to apologize early before the show
[00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:52.880]   where we talked a little bit about anonymous and hackers and I challenge them.
[00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:56.000]   And ever since our internet access has been down here at the Twit
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:00.480]   cottage, so I just like to apologize and say, you guys rock.
[00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:03.720]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:05.400]   Comcast is just a dangerous thing.
[00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:06.600]   Completely went down.
[00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:07.320]   Really?
[00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:07.920]   You're not joking?
[00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:08.640]   Oh, I'm not joking.
[00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:12.080]   I mean, we still have internet access because I have, I shouldn't even say who
[00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:12.680]   else I have.
[00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:18.000]   Do you think they broke Comcast just just to attack me, they broke Comcast?
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.440]   It's possible.
[00:25:19.440 --> 00:25:22.640]   They've done stupider things.
[00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:26.320]   I say nothing.
[00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:30.000]   Who's your internet service provider, Jeff?
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:31.440]   I'm not.
[00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:39.240]   No, I think I think I'm going to I'm going to scribe this to just normal.
[00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:40.880]   System failure.
[00:25:40.880 --> 00:25:44.160]   The normal rock, rock steady Comcast connection.
[00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:44.840]   Actually, it was.
[00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:45.440]   Exactly.
[00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:49.680]   However, if across the screen you see marching, hackstored.
[00:25:49.680 --> 00:25:53.000]   You know why, you know why.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:57.280]   OK, this, this portion of the show and by the way, we are backing up right now
[00:25:57.280 --> 00:25:58.040]   with carbonite.
[00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:01.400]   Just in case brought to you by carbonite.com.
[00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:05.880]   If you still use a computer and you're not living in the cloud entirely, you could
[00:26:05.880 --> 00:26:08.240]   use the cloud to back up and it really is a good solution.
[00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:09.440]   I'm a big fan of carbonite.
[00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:13.720]   When Abby went to college, I put it on her Mac laptop.
[00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:15.520]   She doesn't have to know about it.
[00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:19.640]   Just whenever she's online, even at an insecure open access spot, you know, the
[00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:24.840]   library, the internet cafe, carbonites backing up securely using SSL to make sure
[00:26:24.840 --> 00:26:26.840]   her data is always available.
[00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:30.720]   If she should lose the laptop, accidentally throw out a paper that she needs.
[00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:34.400]   If a hard drive should crash, she can log on to her carbonite account on any
[00:26:34.400 --> 00:26:37.920]   computer anywhere at the library, her roommates, even with an
[00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:41.560]   iPhone app or that's free or a free BlackBerry app and get her data back.
[00:26:41.560 --> 00:26:42.760]   See it, use it.
[00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:43.320]   It's there.
[00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:44.040]   It's safe.
[00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:45.760]   That's why I love carbonite.
[00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:50.360]   Easy to restore, easy to use, automatic backup to the cloud PC or Mac.
[00:26:50.360 --> 00:26:52.240]   And very affordable too.
[00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:54.320]   Now you could try it free for two weeks, 15 days.
[00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:58.720]   If you use the offer code Twig, TWIG, T-W-I-G, go to carbonite.com.
[00:26:58.720 --> 00:26:59.720]   Use the offer code Twig.
[00:26:59.720 --> 00:27:03.120]   If, and I do, I do encourage you to try it because it does use your broadband.
[00:27:03.120 --> 00:27:07.080]   And you know, you know, if you, if you don't have much speed or whatever, you
[00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:09.400]   may not find it satisfactory because it does have to use that.
[00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:14.480]   But if, if you like it after you buy it or decide to buy it, use the offer code
[00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:16.840]   Twig and you'll save two months off.
[00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:19.000]   It's only $55 a year.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:20.360]   If that's, that's 15 cents a day.
[00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:24.680]   You'll save two, two months on that when you use the offer code Twig.
[00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:27.040]   C-A-R-B-O-N-I-T-E carbonite.
[00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:28.880]   You got to back it up to get it back.
[00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:29.520]   Do it right.
[00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:30.600]   I've tried all the others.
[00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:34.680]   This is the one carbonite.com.
[00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:36.560]   Chipotle.
[00:27:37.120 --> 00:27:37.880]   So did you.
[00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:40.920]   Chipotle.
[00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:43.640]   Did you see I should have saved it for the end.
[00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:45.680]   The onion, the little onion bit.
[00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:47.080]   That's kind of great.
[00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:48.520]   I thought that was so funny.
[00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:50.280]   And that's what made me think of the chipotle.
[00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:53.960]   Let me see if I can find this.
[00:27:53.960 --> 00:28:01.840]   They, they parody the Google free, free stuff.
[00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:02.680]   Did you see it, Jeff?
[00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:03.360]   No.
[00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:04.160]   Onion, Google.
[00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:05.400]   I'll play it for you guys.
[00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:07.960]   The last time I played.
[00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:12.080]   It's they call it whisper ads.
[00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:17.520]   The last time I played an onion thing, YouTube's automatic content control.
[00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:18.240]   Pulled it off.
[00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:22.720]   Pulled us off YouTube.
[00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:25.880]   So I, I, I, I'll ask YouTube not to do that.
[00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:31.960]   Actually, I talked to a baritone day and he said, no, that wasn't us.
[00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:33.080]   We don't, we don't care.
[00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:34.080]   We want you to play it.
[00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:36.080]   Let me see.
[00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:42.320]   And I, let me see if I could play this for you without, without triggering anything here.
[00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:45.240]   And the content protection realm.
[00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:49.040]   Is this it?
[00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:50.240]   Is it playing?
[00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:55.040]   Apologize for the pause.
[00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:59.840]   Don't, don't pay any attention to the site that I'm playing this on.
[00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:02.840]   Watch again, it says.
[00:29:03.840 --> 00:29:06.080]   Oh, well, never mind.
[00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:07.440]   I'll play it for you later.
[00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:08.720]   Huh?
[00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:10.280]   It's in the dock.
[00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:11.960]   Of course, it's in the dock.
[00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:12.920]   Everything's in the dock.
[00:29:12.920 --> 00:29:14.080]   Hello.
[00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:20.080]   I got something else from Google, by the way, while I was here, it is.
[00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:20.560]   I found it.
[00:29:20.560 --> 00:29:21.080]   I got it.
[00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:21.680]   I got it.
[00:29:21.680 --> 00:29:22.200]   Thank you.
[00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:27.000]   I got a little gift from the, from the Googlers when I was visiting the holiday thing.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:31.240]   What a guy from Android division came over, Randall said, Hey, we sent you an email.
[00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:32.040]   You never responded.
[00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:35.320]   Do you actually want to review this new Google phone?
[00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:36.880]   I said, well, let me take a look at it.
[00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:43.240]   This is the Galaxy S essentially for Google with the, with the branded.
[00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:44.760]   Oh, I know what's wrong.
[00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:46.960]   Comcast is down.
[00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:52.280]   I know what's wrong.
[00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:53.520]   I can't do anything.
[00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:54.240]   I'm stuck.
[00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:56.200]   Thanks, anonymous.
[00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:58.600]   You know, have I said how much I love for channeling?
[00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:02.000]   They're just really a great bunch of people.
[00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:05.480]   So have any of you got the Galaxy S Joel?
[00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:06.120]   You must have it.
[00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:06.720]   You have it around.
[00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:15.040]   No, we've, yeah, we've got Buchanan, who is our major, Matt Buchanan, who is our major phone testing guy has it right now and is actually writing his review up.
[00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:16.680]   But I didn't get to play with it.
[00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:18.560]   It got, it came in Friday right when I was leaving.
[00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:22.000]   Well, and I should say that Gina and I are big Nexus one.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:23.360]   You still use your Nexus one, Gina?
[00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:23.960]   Yep.
[00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:25.440]   Next one's still my primary phone.
[00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:27.800]   I still consider it the best phone ever.
[00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:30.320]   And I, you know, I've been using a droid X because I wanted Verizon.
[00:30:30.840 --> 00:30:43.520]   But, and I like the bigger screen, but I have to say, once I, you get back to that vanilla Google experience, it really, all the carriers, Motorola Blur H, even HTC, which I think the sense you eyes pretty nice.
[00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:46.680]   It's still not as good as just that pure.
[00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:49.400]   Google deliciousness.
[00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:54.080]   Can you does the curve in the screen actually make any sort of difference to you?
[00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:55.160]   Can you feel that at all?
[00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:55.680]   No.
[00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:56.520]   And you know, I don't know.
[00:30:56.520 --> 00:30:57.880]   Is it in the screen or in the bezel?
[00:30:57.880 --> 00:31:00.280]   It's you could see a very slight curve.
[00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:02.240]   I mean, it is very, very slight.
[00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:03.360]   And it may be.
[00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:06.200]   I mean, the theory might be that's to is to reduce reflections.
[00:31:06.200 --> 00:31:06.640]   I don't know.
[00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:08.280]   I, I can hardly notice it.
[00:31:08.280 --> 00:31:11.200]   Um, but this is gingerbread two point.
[00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:12.880]   This is T mobile.
[00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:14.240]   You know, T mobile is fine where I am.
[00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:17.000]   I don't, I don't know why I'm so set on having Verizon.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:28.640]   Um, but it is, it just reminds you, uh, how good I think, uh, the pure Android experiences, you know, and what, and what, what in gingerbread is making you a couple of things about this.
[00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:29.920]   First of all, it's much snappier.
[00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:31.800]   I think it's the same processor as the other galaxy.
[00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:36.840]   Yes, but gingerbread apparently uses more GPU acceleration and you really do notice the difference.
[00:31:36.840 --> 00:31:38.720]   It is much, much snappier.
[00:31:38.720 --> 00:31:43.640]   It really feels, uh, it feels like a faster phone and a more responsive phone.
[00:31:43.640 --> 00:31:45.800]   I love the Samsung OLED screens.
[00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:48.640]   I mean, they, they really do a nice job on that.
[00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:52.800]   Um, there, you know, there's some more subtle differences.
[00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:58.360]   Uh, for instance, um, the, uh, let me, let me start a new text message.
[00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:00.560]   The keyboard has changed slightly.
[00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:09.280]   You know, I use swipe and then I, in fact, it was going to be my pick, uh, today's Swift key, which I really like, but this has some Swift key like features.
[00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:17.480]   This, if you start typing, it gives you suggestions here, which you can click is the new keyboard.
[00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:19.680]   There's some, so I think they've done a nice job.
[00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:22.080]   I think the keyboard is very good, subtle, but good.
[00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:24.080]   There's some interesting choices.
[00:32:24.080 --> 00:32:27.800]   For instance, they've put manage apps right on the main menu here.
[00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:32.400]   So then, after years of saying you don't need a tax killer,
[00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:36.560]   they put it in the main menu.
[00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:41.420]   And I have to say one of the things, and I'm sure there's much more.
[00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:44.480]   You know, I'm just every time I use it, I discover more stuff.
[00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:50.680]   But one of the things I really like is the new, the new battery display.
[00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:54.460]   Let me get the, um, do do do do do, do do do.
[00:32:54.460 --> 00:32:56.040]   Where is it?
[00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:57.880]   Where do they put that power?
[00:32:57.880 --> 00:32:59.480]   Now I've lost it.
[00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:06.960]   It really does seem like OS has come into its own and gingerbread though, like visually
[00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:08.600]   and the way it all kind of hangs together.
[00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:11.760]   Like it doesn't feel like it's necessarily just cloning.
[00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:12.800]   Oh, it's beautiful.
[00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:13.640]   It's, it is.
[00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:14.200]   It really is.
[00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:18.500]   It's something here's, this is the, you know, we who have to survive with these
[00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:20.800]   phones for more than five or six hours a day.
[00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:23.040]   Spent a lot of time in this battery section.
[00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:24.280]   Look, they have a graph now.
[00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:27.000]   It says four hours, 53 minutes on battery.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   And if I tap the graph, it shows me this is great.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.200]   This is battery usage.
[00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:33.840]   It shows me phone signal.
[00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:36.400]   It's GPS on Wi-Fi.
[00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:38.920]   It's so geeky, no, it's green on.
[00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:40.400]   So these little bars are when the screen.
[00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:42.240]   So you can really see what's using it.
[00:33:42.240 --> 00:33:43.440]   I know.
[00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:45.680]   I guess most people wouldn't want that, but I like it.
[00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:50.840]   No, I mean, it's nice for when mom says, why does my phone do it after two hours?
[00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:51.840]   Well, this was a lot of it.
[00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:54.560]   Cause you know, you saw right here, I'll display you's 21%.
[00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:59.880]   But now you really can get granular on that and see a graph of battery usage.
[00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:01.440]   That is nerdy, isn't it?
[00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:04.280]   It's a very, you know, though, on the other hand, is a very polished.
[00:34:04.280 --> 00:34:05.880]   Phone.
[00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:08.320]   I mean, literally and figuratively, it's piano black.
[00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:09.880]   It just feels good in your hand.
[00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:11.360]   It's just a nice, good hand field.
[00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:14.040]   Is it plastic?
[00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:14.600]   Yes.
[00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:15.160]   It is.
[00:34:15.160 --> 00:34:18.240]   You know, it's just, it's funny because Samsung, it's just like the galaxy has,
[00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:20.560]   it's just like the focus, which is the windows phone.
[00:34:20.560 --> 00:34:22.160]   It's got a little hump here.
[00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:24.360]   All the phones now seem to have these little humps at the bottom
[00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:25.560]   for antenna, I guess.
[00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:27.640]   Um, good camera.
[00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:33.320]   By the way, first time I've had a really decent camera, an iPhone 5 almost is good
[00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:35.160]   camera on an Android device.
[00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:36.480]   One or two cameras.
[00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:37.760]   Front facing two cameras.
[00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:44.600]   Uh, you know, no software as far as even Fring doesn't use that front camera yet,
[00:34:44.600 --> 00:34:45.960]   but it's there.
[00:34:45.960 --> 00:34:49.200]   Um, good video.
[00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:50.200]   Not, not seven.
[00:34:50.200 --> 00:34:50.680]   Here I am.
[00:34:50.680 --> 00:34:53.240]   Not 720p, by the way, 480p.
[00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:57.880]   I asked, I just ran a little bit that said, you know, it's a phone and people are complaining.
[00:34:57.880 --> 00:34:59.040]   You can't shoot high death video.
[00:34:59.040 --> 00:34:59.480]   Come on.
[00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:02.240]   And 40p is very good.
[00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:03.240]   The quality is very good.
[00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:04.200]   The camera is very good.
[00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:05.160]   It's surprisingly good.
[00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:07.880]   Uh, the other thing is out to other media people.
[00:35:07.880 --> 00:35:11.280]   Uh, no, they did not hand it out at the media event, but I understand Googlers are
[00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:14.440]   going to get them and it will be available at Best Buy on Thursday.
[00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:16.680]   Best Buy says two units only.
[00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:19.920]   Uh, they'll start selling it at when the store was open at 8 a.m.
[00:35:20.120 --> 00:35:22.040]   online, 8 a.m. Eastern time.
[00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:26.120]   And, uh, what was the best they shipped on locker?
[00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:27.320]   They only on T-Mobile.
[00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:28.520]   This is for everybody.
[00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:29.320]   There's apparently both.
[00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:32.480]   This is an unlocked, which is, I'm thrilled.
[00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:35.040]   You know, they want this one back, but I will buy it.
[00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:36.760]   Probably spend more money to get it unlocked.
[00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:37.560]   Unlocked.
[00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:38.240]   I'm not in front.
[00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:38.600]   Locked.
[00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:39.160]   Five five.
[00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:40.040]   Yeah, it's unsubsidized.
[00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:42.680]   So it's expensive, really way too much.
[00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:45.080]   Does it have the 18D frequencies to?
[00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:47.280]   Ah, I don't think so.
[00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:47.840]   I don't know.
[00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:49.400]   That's a good question.
[00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:49.920]   I don't know.
[00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:57.200]   I think this is, I think once again, uh, if you want the best Android experience,
[00:35:57.200 --> 00:35:58.000]   it's a Google phone.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:59.200]   Oddly enough.
[00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:02.160]   So if you had a draw, would you after it?
[00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:03.480]   Would you upgrade the first one?
[00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:04.480]   Yeah.
[00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:05.040]   Oh, yeah.
[00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:07.120]   In fact, I'm not going to use this instead of the Droid X.
[00:36:07.120 --> 00:36:09.240]   I'm going to buy one and put my T-Mobile sim in it.
[00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:10.800]   Because it's just really nice.
[00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:12.760]   I wish, you know, I wish I had this in France.
[00:36:12.760 --> 00:36:14.680]   It's really nice, very speedy.
[00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:18.600]   I put, um, you know, I can bog that Droid X down pretty good.
[00:36:18.600 --> 00:36:21.200]   And I guess that's gingerbread because I don't think the processor is that different.
[00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:23.480]   But, um, that a couple of negatives.
[00:36:23.480 --> 00:36:25.560]   One is you can't, there's no SD card slot.
[00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:29.960]   So you, you, but it does come with 16 gigs, which is, you know, I was able to put a, you
[00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:31.360]   know, decent amount of music on there.
[00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:36.400]   Um, it seems to have, I think it has a gig of storage for the apps.
[00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:40.240]   I must be wrong, but it seems like there's tons of room for app storage.
[00:36:40.240 --> 00:36:43.040]   If I go to manage apps, I just got a ton of space.
[00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:45.320]   Um, that's good.
[00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:49.120]   248 makes used 724 free.
[00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:54.280]   Doesn't that sound like there's a mega ram in that mega vap space in addition.
[00:36:54.280 --> 00:36:59.440]   That's the internal storage in addition to the 16 gigs of SD card.
[00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:00.800]   Yeah.
[00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:05.240]   It was a 529 without a plan, 199 with a two year.
[00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:05.920]   Okay.
[00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:06.360]   Best buy.
[00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:06.800]   Okay.
[00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:10.960]   It certainly looks like those screens are navigating between those screens very quickly.
[00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:11.840]   They seem snappy.
[00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:12.600]   Very snappy.
[00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:14.120]   Just watching and just step around.
[00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:17.960]   And I'm running a fairly, you know, I always like these stupid live wallpapers.
[00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:18.680]   This is a live.
[00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:22.280]   Closest to really stupid.
[00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:23.560]   We did some wallpapers.
[00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:24.120]   Yeah.
[00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:24.600]   Yeah.
[00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:26.320]   I put this one on.
[00:37:26.320 --> 00:37:30.640]   This is, this is how I test how snappy a phone is this, this wallpaper just
[00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:32.240]   kills the droid X.
[00:37:32.240 --> 00:37:36.760]   It's a fish tank and, um, and the fish are swimming around in the background.
[00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:38.400]   I mean, this is a lot going on in this thing.
[00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:40.600]   It doesn't, doesn't, it doesn't phase it.
[00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:43.040]   I mean, it's just as snappy.
[00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:48.120]   The other thing I found is having multiple screens, like seven screens, really
[00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:52.800]   slows down the droid X, having this only has five screens in the gingerbread.
[00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:56.120]   Um, having a lot of widgets seems to make a difference.
[00:37:56.120 --> 00:38:00.240]   You know, in terms of performance, but nothing that I've done so far as bogged
[00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:00.800]   this thing down.
[00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:05.320]   See, that's still my favorite thing about about, like Android phones in general,
[00:38:05.320 --> 00:38:09.080]   it's just the way that the front page and all that information is put up there.
[00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:12.840]   If I could have that plus all of the iPhone apps and the whole, you know,
[00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:15.000]   iPhone experience, so that would be the perfect phone.
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:16.120]   We're getting close, aren't we?
[00:38:16.120 --> 00:38:21.160]   I mean, uh, angry birds is on there, a fruit ninjas on there, a number of
[00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:24.040]   companies have announced they're going to do Android versions.
[00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:27.040]   The only one that seems to be a real hold out is Netflix who says, well,
[00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:29.320]   we're worried about, you know, piracy.
[00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:33.040]   Yeah, there's still the limit of, I think, didn't they just bump it up for gingerbread?
[00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:38.600]   I think they went from 25 meg to 50 meg on, on how big an app can be.
[00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:39.880]   Ah, okay.
[00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:44.760]   And a lot of the really hot, uh, I huge apps, especially the games are like,
[00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:47.160]   yeah, many hundred and many plays almost a gig.
[00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:49.080]   It's 700 megs, which is great.
[00:38:49.080 --> 00:38:50.520]   Like, oh, the game is so good.
[00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:51.240]   So awesome.
[00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:51.640]   I know.
[00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:54.520]   So you play these games and you're like, like, you know, that's a lot of it for me
[00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:55.000]   on the iPhone.
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:55.720]   And I love the iPhone.
[00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:58.760]   I love the, the four hardware and the experience and, you know, whatever.
[00:38:58.760 --> 00:39:02.760]   It's all great, but I could probably move to Android, but I, I, I feel like with my
[00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:07.080]   iPhone, I have a games platform that's fairly credible and my tool.
[00:39:07.080 --> 00:39:10.600]   And then, you know, if I go to Android, it's really just the tools, but yeah, they'll,
[00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:11.160]   they'll get there.
[00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:12.200]   It's worth with friends.
[00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:14.680]   They've been asked words with friends is going to be on here.
[00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:19.960]   That was a big missing, uh, a gap bought by Zing now too.
[00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:21.480]   Now with Zing, uh, yeah.
[00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:21.880]   Yeah.
[00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:22.280]   Yeah.
[00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:23.880]   It's going to get even more insidious.
[00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:24.200]   Yeah.
[00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:28.040]   Can I ask all you geniuses to tip questions?
[00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:28.360]   Yes.
[00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:29.320]   Wait a minute.
[00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:30.680]   Let me turn down my fruit ninja.
[00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:33.480]   So it's a new one on me.
[00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:34.840]   Oh, you haven't played fruit ninja.
[00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:36.680]   Oh, you're going to love fruit ninja.
[00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:42.920]   You, you slice fruit up as it did, you know, and it's, it's multi touch.
[00:39:42.920 --> 00:39:43.160]   Yeah.
[00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:47.720]   It's for people who like chipotle or fruit, you know, or fruit.
[00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:51.080]   And they said the analogy with the world's problems.
[00:39:51.080 --> 00:39:53.640]   Oh, don't hit the bomb though.
[00:39:53.640 --> 00:39:56.120]   Oh, good to know.
[00:39:56.120 --> 00:39:56.280]   Yeah.
[00:39:56.280 --> 00:39:56.680]   Yeah.
[00:39:56.680 --> 00:39:57.080]   Yeah.
[00:39:57.080 --> 00:39:57.720]   Oh, go ahead.
[00:39:57.720 --> 00:39:58.360]   What's your question?
[00:39:58.360 --> 00:39:59.480]   Go ahead, Jeff.
[00:39:59.480 --> 00:39:59.880]   I'm sorry.
[00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:04.680]   I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm trying to, um, two things.
[00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:06.600]   One, my, my galaxy tab.
[00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:10.360]   I found this is a problem that's not uncommon, unfortunately.
[00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:13.640]   It suddenly stops recognizing phios routers.
[00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:17.000]   And it won't get an IP from the,
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:17.960]   I mean, Wi-Fi.
[00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:19.080]   Yeah.
[00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:21.640]   It won't get, and, and then this is, there's a lot of them,
[00:40:21.640 --> 00:40:25.720]   and it's across carriers across galaxy tab carriers.
[00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:28.920]   For eyes and by the way, is notorious for using a really crappy
[00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:31.000]   box for its routers.
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:33.160]   Is that what it is?
[00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:37.240]   Well, any, any, any tip for me, anything I should try?
[00:40:37.240 --> 00:40:39.160]   Jake's coming home Saturday, so I'll have him do it.
[00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:41.320]   That seems weird.
[00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:42.280]   I mean, Wi-Fi is why.
[00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:42.840]   Very strange.
[00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:43.560]   Right.
[00:40:43.560 --> 00:40:44.600]   That's the thing, right?
[00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:45.480]   Wi-Fi is Wi-Fi.
[00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:46.920]   I'd blame Verizon.
[00:40:46.920 --> 00:40:48.440]   Well, it's their fault.
[00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:49.000]   Yeah.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:50.920]   But, you know, how you're never going to get anywhere,
[00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:51.800]   trying to convince them of that.
[00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:54.120]   If you, I mean, does it not fix it?
[00:40:54.120 --> 00:40:56.040]   If you turn off your router and turn it back on?
[00:40:56.040 --> 00:40:57.240]   No.
[00:40:57.240 --> 00:40:57.560]   No.
[00:40:57.560 --> 00:41:01.800]   People are saying, well, it fixes it if you, if you rebuild the galaxy tab,
[00:41:01.800 --> 00:41:03.560]   but, you know, you don't want to do that every three weeks,
[00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:06.920]   it just suddenly stops recognizing anymore.
[00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:07.960]   That's weird.
[00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:09.960]   You get an iPad with that fix it?
[00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:11.880]   Hey, hey, hey.
[00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:12.920]   It fixes everything.
[00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:14.520]   He already sent his iPad back.
[00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:17.240]   I just made a hundred bucks from Steve Jobs.
[00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:17.960]   That was awesome.
[00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:19.720]   I'm bio-ev.
[00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:20.680]   Are you on that program?
[00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:21.400]   Because I am too.
[00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:23.800]   The Steve Jobs $100 if you mentioned me program.
[00:41:23.800 --> 00:41:24.360]   That's great.
[00:41:24.360 --> 00:41:25.000]   That's great.
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:28.760]   It's a real subsidy for those of us working in the, in the trade.
[00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:30.680]   I'm on, I'm on the academic equivalent,
[00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:33.880]   which is the, I pledged to quote Clay Shricky once a day.
[00:41:33.880 --> 00:41:34.520]   Oh, that's good.
[00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:35.800]   That's good.
[00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:38.040]   Does Clay give you the money or does Steve?
[00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:38.760]   No, there's no money.
[00:41:38.760 --> 00:41:40.520]   It's considered just a good to the world.
[00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:40.840]   It's just a good.
[00:41:40.840 --> 00:41:46.040]   By the way, literal net, it's a joke.
[00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:51.160]   So my galaxy, when I go to mygalaxytab.net, you're right.
[00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:54.680]   This is, this is apparently a very common problem.
[00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:58.520]   We rise in Fios and the galaxy tab.
[00:41:58.520 --> 00:42:01.240]   It won't, it won't DHCP to the tab.
[00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:02.280]   That's very interesting.
[00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:05.080]   So here's my other quick question.
[00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:09.320]   On my Android phone, when I go to all the applications,
[00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:10.680]   there are an alphabetical order.
[00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:14.040]   On my galaxy tab, they're not, and I can't figure out how to put them in.
[00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:15.000]   That's a carrier.
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:15.880]   That's really annoying.
[00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:16.840]   It's a carrier issue.
[00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:18.040]   That's the carrier?
[00:42:18.040 --> 00:42:18.680]   What?
[00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:19.320]   Really?
[00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:21.800]   Yeah, because, well, I have the same problem on the Motorola.
[00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:27.880]   And then I, and I went to the, I opened my apps on my, on my,
[00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:30.280]   Nexus S and I was shocked.
[00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:33.000]   Angry Birds was, was up at the front, which had never been before.
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:35.320]   It's in alphabetical order.
[00:42:35.320 --> 00:42:37.400]   No, no, no, no.
[00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:40.520]   Yeah, that's a carrier or maybe not carrier, maybe hardware manufacturer,
[00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:42.280]   but that's, that's, it's probably hardware.
[00:42:42.280 --> 00:42:44.200]   It's probably, that's probably the Samsung thing.
[00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:46.040]   This is why.
[00:42:46.040 --> 00:42:47.880]   I'm trying to open up an order on the Nexus one.
[00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:49.480]   Yeah, because it's a Google experience.
[00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:49.880]   All right.
[00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:51.800]   And, and I just assumed it was the same everywhere.
[00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:52.280]   That's crazy.
[00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:55.080]   This is the only thing that drives me really crazy is that these buttons
[00:42:55.640 --> 00:42:58.840]   are in different orders on almost every device, you know?
[00:42:58.840 --> 00:42:59.080]   Yeah.
[00:42:59.080 --> 00:43:01.960]   I wish they would the bottom buttons, you know, so I have to relearn
[00:43:01.960 --> 00:43:05.320]   first back menu search home.
[00:43:05.320 --> 00:43:06.520]   I mean, that's perfectly logical.
[00:43:06.520 --> 00:43:08.360]   It's just different from the way Motorola does it.
[00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:11.000]   This, these are soft buttons, by the way.
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:12.600]   And I know some people like physical buttons.
[00:43:12.600 --> 00:43:13.800]   I kind of like the soft buttons.
[00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:17.800]   I think this is a boy, you're going to love this, Gina.
[00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:20.920]   Yeah, it looks really, it looks really cool.
[00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:21.480]   It's, it's great.
[00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:23.320]   Jeff, to go back to that, your, your router question,
[00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:25.480]   can you change the channel or change the encryption?
[00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:27.320]   And see if maybe I just saw that here that I don't know.
[00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:27.880]   I've got to find that out.
[00:43:27.880 --> 00:43:29.560]   Somebody said to change the channel to 11.
[00:43:29.560 --> 00:43:32.440]   Yeah, to, to, to something different than what it is.
[00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:33.240]   Maybe you're getting interference.
[00:43:33.240 --> 00:43:33.560]   To the left.
[00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:36.200]   But that's not a file.
[00:43:36.200 --> 00:43:37.320]   You know, that's not a Fios router,
[00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:37.800]   specific thing.
[00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:39.720]   That's something I would, you know, do with any router.
[00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:41.320]   I was having trouble connecting.
[00:43:41.320 --> 00:43:43.640]   This seems to be a direct interaction between
[00:43:43.640 --> 00:43:47.320]   Fios and the Galaxy Tabas.
[00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:47.960]   I look through these.
[00:43:47.960 --> 00:43:49.800]   But Tabas find everywhere else.
[00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:50.120]   Yeah.
[00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:50.760]   Not Hollywood.
[00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:54.360]   So I'm not watching movies on it at home.
[00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:55.960]   I don't want to go through my van with.
[00:43:55.960 --> 00:43:56.440]   Yeah.
[00:43:56.440 --> 00:43:58.520]   So you're, you're a big fan of the tab.
[00:43:58.520 --> 00:43:59.160]   I'm, I'm loving it.
[00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:02.200]   You know, and because I had to write a column on it today,
[00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:05.240]   and it is the perfect form factor for typing.
[00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:06.520]   You're kidding.
[00:44:06.520 --> 00:44:08.040]   It's not too small to type.
[00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:11.960]   No, it's, it's, it's, it's incredibly right for typing, thumb typing.
[00:44:11.960 --> 00:44:13.240]   Very interesting.
[00:44:13.240 --> 00:44:14.120]   Beauty of it.
[00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:15.240]   Um.
[00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:17.000]   Typed a column on it.
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:17.480]   Yeah.
[00:44:17.480 --> 00:44:18.040]   Oh, yeah.
[00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:19.560]   Like, you float on the tab.
[00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:21.000]   Without wanting to kill anyone.
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:21.960]   That's amazing.
[00:44:21.960 --> 00:44:22.440]   That's saying.
[00:44:22.440 --> 00:44:23.240]   That is a thing.
[00:44:23.240 --> 00:44:23.560]   Yeah.
[00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:25.160]   That's, that's the key to it.
[00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:29.720]   So you can really, um, I can't show you my thumbs, but, but it really.
[00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:30.040]   Yeah.
[00:44:30.040 --> 00:44:31.720]   And that's what you can't do on the iPad.
[00:44:31.720 --> 00:44:34.680]   Uh, you have to type like a typewriter on the iPad.
[00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:35.000]   It's.
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:39.640]   So are you using Google Docs, Jeff, or?
[00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:42.760]   Uh, using think, uh, no, I'm using, um.
[00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:44.200]   Think office.
[00:44:44.200 --> 00:44:44.440]   Okay.
[00:44:44.440 --> 00:44:48.920]   We think office and the God bless, um, Dropbox.
[00:44:48.920 --> 00:44:49.800]   Yeah.
[00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:50.120]   Yes.
[00:44:50.120 --> 00:44:51.320]   Indeed.
[00:44:51.320 --> 00:44:53.320]   So, uh, the combination works just beautifully.
[00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:54.920]   So I had the start of this column.
[00:44:54.920 --> 00:44:59.320]   I had to write and then I just went on the train today when I'm on the ground and I'm
[00:44:59.320 --> 00:45:02.760]   going along and I get back and I switch to my other machine and, and I have a, you know,
[00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:05.160]   you start to have a sense of what life is like on Chrome.
[00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:06.200]   Yep.
[00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:08.680]   Dropbox is awesome.
[00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:09.640]   Yeah, it is.
[00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:10.040]   Beautiful.
[00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:11.560]   That's incredible.
[00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:14.360]   I would never write a blog post or, uh, or, uh,
[00:45:14.360 --> 00:45:16.360]   I can't imagine ever doing that.
[00:45:16.360 --> 00:45:16.840]   Sounds like pain.
[00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:20.600]   That's why I really like the MacBook Air because it's a key, it's a keyboard.
[00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:23.560]   And even, I tried even with Chrome to do that for a while and it's just that the
[00:45:23.560 --> 00:45:24.760]   mouse isn't quite as.
[00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:28.840]   You see, you, California, and don't do popular things like I have to do.
[00:45:28.840 --> 00:45:30.040]   We're just standing on the subway.
[00:45:30.040 --> 00:45:30.760]   Yes.
[00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:31.320]   You're right.
[00:45:31.320 --> 00:45:32.520]   Standing on the subway.
[00:45:32.520 --> 00:45:33.480]   I'm right in the column.
[00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:33.960]   No, you're right.
[00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:36.120]   I sit in my easy chair here.
[00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:38.120]   You're in your chauffeur urban limo.
[00:45:38.120 --> 00:45:38.680]   My limo.
[00:45:38.680 --> 00:45:39.240]   Yeah.
[00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:39.560]   Yeah.
[00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:40.920]   It's a chipotle.
[00:45:40.920 --> 00:45:41.400]   Mm.
[00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:41.960]   That was good.
[00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:46.120]   Did we was that on the show or is that was off the show?
[00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:47.080]   That was before the show.
[00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:48.280]   We should explain.
[00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:49.880]   I have never been to burrito now.
[00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:51.560]   I have never been to Chipotle.
[00:45:51.560 --> 00:45:54.360]   No longer owned by McDonald's.
[00:45:54.360 --> 00:45:55.560]   There's the good news.
[00:45:55.560 --> 00:45:58.440]   And, uh, both Gina and Jeff are major Chipotle fans.
[00:45:58.440 --> 00:46:03.720]   So, uh, Eileen, I think was coerced by, uh, these guys to stop at the chipotle because
[00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:05.480]   she lives near one and bring me some.
[00:46:05.480 --> 00:46:08.920]   And I, I confess not only is the, not only is the,
[00:46:12.920 --> 00:46:17.960]   not only is the, not only was the bowl good, but there's something magical about these chips.
[00:46:17.960 --> 00:46:22.360]   It's a little embarrassing living so close to Mexico and saying how good Chipotle is.
[00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:25.720]   You live in San Diego and you're eating it somewhere that used to be on my McDonald's.
[00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:26.680]   Come on.
[00:46:26.680 --> 00:46:27.080]   I know.
[00:46:27.080 --> 00:46:28.440]   It's, it's a little embarrassing.
[00:46:28.440 --> 00:46:31.800]   Okay.
[00:46:31.800 --> 00:46:35.560]   The chips have a certain, there's somewhere sort of, um,
[00:46:35.560 --> 00:46:38.760]   like they've been sprayed with a lime coating or something.
[00:46:38.760 --> 00:46:40.680]   Gosh, that sounds great.
[00:46:40.680 --> 00:46:41.160]   Mm.
[00:46:41.160 --> 00:46:41.640]   Mm.
[00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:42.200]   Mm.
[00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:45.720]   Leo, Leo, you now have to go and experience Chipotle because as you stand on most of the way,
[00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:49.720]   the most of their design is you stand online, you see them grilling the meat and cutting up the meat.
[00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:52.120]   And you say, I don't know a little more meat medium sauce, please.
[00:46:52.120 --> 00:46:55.240]   Can I have some more black beans and they put it on the whole thing down the line?
[00:46:55.240 --> 00:46:59.320]   And so it's truly your burrito at the end.
[00:46:59.320 --> 00:47:00.120]   You know what else is?
[00:47:00.120 --> 00:47:04.200]   It's like the Google of burritos because it's personalized.
[00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:07.800]   I, I, I just I'm baffled by the whole thing, but there is a parrot.
[00:47:07.800 --> 00:47:09.000]   I mean, it was very good.
[00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:14.200]   I mean, we have Mexican restaurants run by actual Mexicans all over the place in,
[00:47:14.200 --> 00:47:16.360]   in Petalomand as do you in San Diego.
[00:47:16.360 --> 00:47:17.400]   Yes.
[00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:20.760]   We obviously need new, clean episodes to talk about.
[00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:21.560]   [laughter]
[00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:22.040]   It's bad.
[00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:24.520]   We use unbreakable, but we're so, we're, we're in trouble.
[00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:29.560]   Did you like, did you like the, um, because Eileen really didn't enjoy the, um,
[00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:30.600]   sectionals episode.
[00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:31.320]   I thought it was good.
[00:47:31.320 --> 00:47:33.000]   Uh.
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:35.800]   She was sad because the main singers didn't get to sing.
[00:47:35.800 --> 00:47:37.320]   Yeah, no, that's true.
[00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:40.360]   But I'd like that they're giving the rest of the cast a little more, a little more airtime.
[00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:41.960]   I thought you were going to ask me about the Christmas episode,
[00:47:41.960 --> 00:47:43.240]   which a lot of people were, were weird about.
[00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:43.800]   I haven't seen that yet.
[00:47:43.800 --> 00:47:45.000]   I'm a big Grinch fan.
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.000]   So I was, I was kind of tickled by it.
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:47.960]   It's a little bit meaningful.
[00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:48.840]   I thought it was okay.
[00:47:48.840 --> 00:47:51.640]   The sectionals episode that they gave, uh,
[00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:52.200]   Okay.
[00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:55.080]   Now we, now we've had our Chipotle glee, Blake, Frank.
[00:47:55.080 --> 00:47:56.760]   Sorry.
[00:47:56.760 --> 00:47:57.480]   Sorry, everyone.
[00:47:57.480 --> 00:47:59.880]   Person of the year, Time Magazine.
[00:47:59.880 --> 00:48:02.200]   They had that vote online that President,
[00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:06.360]   Premier of Turkey was the winner online, but everybody knew who the person
[00:48:06.360 --> 00:48:07.480]   that you really was going to be.
[00:48:07.480 --> 00:48:12.120]   And in fact, if you look at the cover of Time Magazine, it is the Zuck.
[00:48:12.120 --> 00:48:15.000]   And it's a scary stare, isn't it?
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:16.760]   He has green eyes.
[00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:19.320]   I didn't ever realize that was my first reaction.
[00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:21.160]   Like did they, Photoshoot?
[00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:22.200]   Only since the movie.
[00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:23.640]   Ah.
[00:48:23.640 --> 00:48:25.800]   It is a, it's a, it's, um,
[00:48:25.800 --> 00:48:28.120]   I, they're doing something, aren't they?
[00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:31.000]   With the, uh, with the, oh, I have to change the camera.
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:34.600]   They're doing something with, it's like a HDR picture or something.
[00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:35.960]   There's something creepy about it.
[00:48:35.960 --> 00:48:40.200]   And yeah, I just think it's really well lit.
[00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:44.200]   You are hip no time.
[00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:45.160]   Well, yeah, it's very clear.
[00:48:45.160 --> 00:48:47.320]   It's very clear what Time Magazine is.
[00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:48.680]   That it's Big Brother, right?
[00:48:48.680 --> 00:48:49.640]   He's watching you.
[00:48:49.640 --> 00:48:52.680]   When you move, by the way, his eyes follow you.
[00:48:52.680 --> 00:48:53.160]   Try that.
[00:48:53.160 --> 00:48:55.720]   He's always looking at you.
[00:48:55.720 --> 00:48:57.960]   There's definitely something there.
[00:48:57.960 --> 00:48:59.480]   Don't you think?
[00:48:59.480 --> 00:49:01.000]   I don't know.
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:02.120]   A little editorial.
[00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:03.320]   Oh, come on.
[00:49:03.320 --> 00:49:04.520]   That's Big Brother, baby.
[00:49:05.320 --> 00:49:06.600]   He doesn't like it.
[00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:11.720]   I just want to know if, like, is it, I can't decide, like, everybody,
[00:49:11.720 --> 00:49:14.520]   at least on like Reddit and places like that today were like,
[00:49:14.520 --> 00:49:16.120]   I can't believe it wasn't a Sange.
[00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:16.680]   No.
[00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:20.680]   And I'm like, I can't believe that it's, would be Zuckerberg or a Sange.
[00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:21.320]   Who should it be?
[00:49:21.320 --> 00:49:23.160]   Both of them see kind of weird.
[00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:24.760]   But am I wrong?
[00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:26.280]   Should it have been in a Sange?
[00:49:26.280 --> 00:49:26.440]   No.
[00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:28.920]   I don't know.
[00:49:28.920 --> 00:49:30.200]   I think both are changing the world.
[00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:31.720]   But you know, here's the thing about it.
[00:49:31.720 --> 00:49:33.080]   It's all BS.
[00:49:33.080 --> 00:49:33.880]   Yeah.
[00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:34.760]   It's just a Sange.
[00:49:34.760 --> 00:49:35.800]   It's a committee at time.
[00:49:35.800 --> 00:49:38.120]   I tweeted today that when I was at People Magazine,
[00:49:38.120 --> 00:49:39.000]   yes, I confess it.
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:42.280]   And it came time to pick the sexiest man live.
[00:49:42.280 --> 00:49:45.640]   It's the same exact process to pick the time man of the year.
[00:49:45.640 --> 00:49:47.400]   Right.
[00:49:47.400 --> 00:49:49.480]   You know, it's call and see if I'm available.
[00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:51.000]   And that's quite mean.
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:54.120]   Here's my little conspiracy moment.
[00:49:54.120 --> 00:49:57.480]   There was a, and this is pure speculation.
[00:49:57.480 --> 00:49:58.360]   Let me be clear here.
[00:49:58.360 --> 00:49:59.560]   I have no idea of this.
[00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:02.200]   But there was a, Obama had to be with a whole bunch of executives today,
[00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:05.320]   and Zuckerberg couldn't go because of a prior obligation.
[00:50:05.320 --> 00:50:05.880]   Is this it?
[00:50:05.880 --> 00:50:09.080]   What could Zuckerberg's, what, what?
[00:50:09.080 --> 00:50:13.800]   What, yeah, what obligation do you not cancel for a meeting with the president?
[00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:15.400]   I don't know.
[00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:16.520]   That's a huge insult.
[00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:18.520]   Oh, I can't do it.
[00:50:18.520 --> 00:50:19.800]   I've got a dentist appointment.
[00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:25.320]   Well, what I had dinner with, at a retreat for Murdoch,
[00:50:25.320 --> 00:50:28.120]   and Zuckerberg was across the table, sitting right next to Murdoch,
[00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:31.640]   and they were doing a major Vulcan mind meld together.
[00:50:31.640 --> 00:50:34.120]   And then Zuck had to go take his girlfriend to a movie.
[00:50:34.120 --> 00:50:35.160]   Wow.
[00:50:35.160 --> 00:50:35.880]   He left.
[00:50:35.880 --> 00:50:36.840]   It's just the way he is.
[00:50:36.840 --> 00:50:39.560]   He has his own priorities.
[00:50:39.560 --> 00:50:40.920]   You know, God bless him.
[00:50:40.920 --> 00:50:45.640]   Did you know the reason I always, in the one hand, I'm, I'm, I'm, you know,
[00:50:45.640 --> 00:50:50.280]   happy for him that he's gotten media savvy, and his charm is coming out now.
[00:50:50.280 --> 00:50:56.280]   But I used to love him being on panels at events where he would just say exactly what he thought
[00:50:56.280 --> 00:50:58.360]   in three words and stare at you.
[00:50:58.360 --> 00:51:03.160]   And unlike everyone else on every panel who's packaged and tries to present,
[00:51:03.160 --> 00:51:04.600]   he was just him.
[00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:05.480]   Yeah.
[00:51:05.480 --> 00:51:07.160]   I hope he doesn't lose that.
[00:51:07.160 --> 00:51:09.960]   I loved it when he said, oh, the iPad, that's not mobile.
[00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:11.320]   I just loved that.
[00:51:11.320 --> 00:51:12.120]   Yeah.
[00:51:12.120 --> 00:51:14.040]   There's something satisfying about that.
[00:51:14.040 --> 00:51:14.280]   Yeah.
[00:51:14.280 --> 00:51:17.560]   The most of these executives are so mealy-mouthed and careful
[00:51:17.560 --> 00:51:23.560]   that you never, oh, that's kind of, here's another picture of Zuck with a bunch of,
[00:51:23.560 --> 00:51:25.560]   oh, you got to look at the family.
[00:51:25.560 --> 00:51:26.840]   Look at the Zuckerberg through the years.
[00:51:26.840 --> 00:51:28.120]   The, I hate to be cruel here.
[00:51:28.120 --> 00:51:30.280]   He's a cute kid, but he's an ugly baby.
[00:51:30.280 --> 00:51:35.400]   He's, isn't going to make baby of the year.
[00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:37.560]   Is he what we call an F and F.L.K.
[00:51:37.560 --> 00:51:39.160]   A funny looking kid?
[00:51:39.160 --> 00:51:40.280]   Yeah.
[00:51:40.280 --> 00:51:41.560]   Yeah, you got to go see that.
[00:51:41.560 --> 00:51:42.600]   Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:51:42.600 --> 00:51:43.240]   F.L.K.
[00:51:43.240 --> 00:51:44.200]   Where is that?
[00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:45.960]   I'm looking for an, uh, is that online?
[00:51:45.960 --> 00:51:46.280]   Oh, it's so.
[00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:48.600]   Who else would you make?
[00:51:48.600 --> 00:51:50.680]   I mean, uh, I guess you could make a politician.
[00:51:50.680 --> 00:51:52.440]   I'm kind of glad that it's not a politician.
[00:51:52.440 --> 00:51:56.760]   I think that, I think you could very well, you make a very strong case.
[00:51:56.760 --> 00:51:59.400]   That no one has changed our world more than Mark Zuckerberg.
[00:51:59.400 --> 00:52:01.160]   I think that's true.
[00:52:01.160 --> 00:52:04.120]   I think, I think Assange will have a lasting impact
[00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:08.360]   and you can never be a secret of again.
[00:52:08.360 --> 00:52:10.520]   And that's going to be really important, but I think Zuckerberg's,
[00:52:10.520 --> 00:52:11.240]   his impact is bigger.
[00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:14.200]   Those are some of the things that he already won with us two years ago.
[00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:14.520]   Right.
[00:52:14.520 --> 00:52:16.200]   If you go to the main page.
[00:52:16.200 --> 00:52:17.720]   Here it is.
[00:52:17.720 --> 00:52:19.400]   There's, this is the slide show.
[00:52:19.400 --> 00:52:22.760]   That's the one that says photos Zuckerberg the early years.
[00:52:22.760 --> 00:52:23.960]   This is not it.
[00:52:24.520 --> 00:52:27.080]   This is what he was doing instead of talking to Obama.
[00:52:27.080 --> 00:52:29.480]   He was posing for these pictures.
[00:52:29.480 --> 00:52:31.160]   But that's posed.
[00:52:31.160 --> 00:52:32.280]   Yeah.
[00:52:32.280 --> 00:52:36.280]   So who are, so this is at the Antonio's Nuthouse in Palo Alto
[00:52:36.280 --> 00:52:40.600]   with, uh, Vice President for Growth, Mobile and International,
[00:52:40.600 --> 00:52:46.040]   Chamath, Palpatia, Mark Zuckerberg, Mark, Mike Schroepfer,
[00:52:46.040 --> 00:52:48.280]   Vice President of Engineering, Jonathan Helfiger,
[00:52:48.280 --> 00:52:51.400]   VP Technical Operations, Chris Cox, VP Product.
[00:52:51.400 --> 00:52:53.400]   They're all playing pool.
[00:52:53.400 --> 00:52:54.200]   Oh, what is that?
[00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:59.080]   Cheryl Sandberg, their CEO or COO and Brett.
[00:52:59.080 --> 00:52:59.560]   Oh, there's Brett.
[00:52:59.560 --> 00:53:00.200]   Brett Taylor.
[00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:00.920]   Yeah.
[00:53:00.920 --> 00:53:02.040]   That's a nice picture, Brett.
[00:53:02.040 --> 00:53:02.600]   Yeah.
[00:53:02.600 --> 00:53:03.320]   Yeah.
[00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:03.960]   He's a good gun.
[00:53:03.960 --> 00:53:04.200]   Yeah.
[00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:04.760]   I like Brett.
[00:53:04.760 --> 00:53:09.320]   There they are, uh, playing paintball.
[00:53:09.320 --> 00:53:15.640]   I think, I think you can make a pretty strong case that,
[00:53:15.640 --> 00:53:17.720]   that this guy deserves to be person over here.
[00:53:17.720 --> 00:53:20.440]   If you go to the back of the time home page, Leo,
[00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:21.880]   you'll see Zuckerberg the early years.
[00:53:21.880 --> 00:53:22.840]   And that's what's funny.
[00:53:22.840 --> 00:53:23.800]   Oh, I got to find that.
[00:53:23.800 --> 00:53:24.120]   All right.
[00:53:24.120 --> 00:53:24.680]   And it's nice.
[00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:26.920]   There's a sweet picture of him with Randy, his sister.
[00:53:26.920 --> 00:53:28.680]   A little kid.
[00:53:28.680 --> 00:53:30.200]   Zuckerberg.
[00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:31.720]   Oh, the early years.
[00:53:31.720 --> 00:53:32.840]   Jesus, sweetheart.
[00:53:32.840 --> 00:53:35.800]   Is it, uh, uh, you see it there?
[00:53:35.800 --> 00:53:38.920]   Time.com underneath the big box,
[00:53:38.920 --> 00:53:41.240]   third line down photos Zuckerberg the early years.
[00:53:41.240 --> 00:53:43.720]   Time.com underneath the big box.
[00:53:43.720 --> 00:53:46.680]   There's, it's not hard to believe that you worked at people, Jeff.
[00:53:46.680 --> 00:53:47.560]   There, come on.
[00:53:47.560 --> 00:53:49.160]   There I see it.
[00:53:49.160 --> 00:53:51.880]   No, seriously, it's the baby ones.
[00:53:51.880 --> 00:53:52.760]   Those are going to hit.
[00:53:52.760 --> 00:53:53.880]   That's, that's it.
[00:53:53.880 --> 00:53:55.480]   That's what we should put on the call.
[00:53:55.480 --> 00:53:56.120]   There's Mark.
[00:53:56.120 --> 00:53:56.680]   Do I mean?
[00:53:56.680 --> 00:53:58.280]   Born in 1984.
[00:53:58.280 --> 00:53:59.080]   Funny looking kid.
[00:53:59.080 --> 00:54:01.480]   Definitely an FLK.
[00:54:01.480 --> 00:54:05.080]   Dobbs for a New York, the son of a dentist and a psychiatrist.
[00:54:05.080 --> 00:54:07.400]   The next one is a cute kid.
[00:54:07.400 --> 00:54:08.200]   That's cute.
[00:54:08.200 --> 00:54:09.720]   Oh, that is pretty cute.
[00:54:09.720 --> 00:54:12.200]   That's by the way, the last time Mark Zuckerberg were a necktie.
[00:54:12.200 --> 00:54:15.800]   There is a havad.
[00:54:15.800 --> 00:54:18.520]   Looks like a havad kid.
[00:54:18.520 --> 00:54:20.200]   He looks just like Jesse Eisenberg, actually.
[00:54:20.840 --> 00:54:23.800]   Well, he says they got the shirts right.
[00:54:23.800 --> 00:54:25.800]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:54:25.800 --> 00:54:26.920]   That's the one thing they got right.
[00:54:26.920 --> 00:54:27.880]   Oh, there he is with Randy.
[00:54:27.880 --> 00:54:28.360]   That's cute.
[00:54:28.360 --> 00:54:28.840]   You're right.
[00:54:28.840 --> 00:54:31.000]   That's really sweetie.
[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:31.240]   Yeah.
[00:54:31.240 --> 00:54:36.040]   You know, I completely changed my tune on Suck.
[00:54:36.040 --> 00:54:36.840]   I know you have.
[00:54:36.840 --> 00:54:37.800]   You really have.
[00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:41.880]   I used to think he was the arch, you know, enemy, the devil in carnet.
[00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:45.560]   And now it just seems like, you know, a smart kid who's,
[00:54:45.560 --> 00:54:48.760]   who kind of has of, I think of some really,
[00:54:49.640 --> 00:54:52.680]   some really significant insight into humans
[00:54:52.680 --> 00:54:56.600]   and how we think about each other and so forth.
[00:54:56.600 --> 00:54:58.440]   Good eye for product on the web, for sure.
[00:54:58.440 --> 00:54:59.160]   Definitely.
[00:54:59.160 --> 00:55:00.200]   Definitely.
[00:55:00.200 --> 00:55:03.080]   Great sense of what builds a great product people want.
[00:55:03.080 --> 00:55:05.480]   We had a debate on Twitter on Sunday about whether he,
[00:55:05.480 --> 00:55:07.240]   who was smarter, Bill Gates or Zuckerberg.
[00:55:07.240 --> 00:55:09.000]   And I said, I think Bill's a better businessman.
[00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:10.680]   His clear mark is not a great businessman.
[00:55:10.680 --> 00:55:13.880]   But I don't think anybody has the insight into people
[00:55:13.880 --> 00:55:15.800]   that Mark Zuckerberg, I mean, I think.
[00:55:15.800 --> 00:55:17.080]   But here's the key difference.
[00:55:17.960 --> 00:55:21.480]   I think, and this is kind of a, we'll end up being a joke about the movie,
[00:55:21.480 --> 00:55:24.360]   but Gates never invented anything.
[00:55:24.360 --> 00:55:26.600]   He executed brilliantly on mentions of others.
[00:55:26.600 --> 00:55:27.160]   Exactly.
[00:55:27.160 --> 00:55:30.680]   Zuckerberg, you know, all movie jokes aside, invented this.
[00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:31.240]   Exactly.
[00:55:31.240 --> 00:55:32.920]   It was his creation.
[00:55:32.920 --> 00:55:33.800]   Yeah.
[00:55:33.800 --> 00:55:36.680]   So you put executives into two buckets,
[00:55:36.680 --> 00:55:38.600]   the Gates bucket or the Jobs bucket.
[00:55:38.600 --> 00:55:39.000]   Right.
[00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:41.240]   I would put Zuckerberg in the Jobs bucket.
[00:55:41.240 --> 00:55:44.040]   Actually, I think Gates and Jobs have more in common.
[00:55:44.040 --> 00:55:45.160]   Zucks more like Waz.
[00:55:45.160 --> 00:55:47.480]   I think Jobs was a productizer, a businessman.
[00:55:47.960 --> 00:55:50.360]   Wait, we think that's a invented social networking?
[00:55:50.360 --> 00:55:50.680]   No.
[00:55:50.680 --> 00:55:51.000]   No, no, no.
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:53.160]   But I think that he has a vision for the product.
[00:55:53.160 --> 00:55:54.120]   You just said it, Gina.
[00:55:54.120 --> 00:55:54.360]   Right.
[00:55:54.360 --> 00:55:56.280]   He definitely has vision for the product, right?
[00:55:56.280 --> 00:55:56.360]   Right.
[00:55:56.360 --> 00:55:59.240]   But he looked at my space and he looked at Friendster and said,
[00:55:59.240 --> 00:56:01.320]   I'm going to take the worst things about these two things
[00:56:01.320 --> 00:56:02.680]   and do them much better, right?
[00:56:02.680 --> 00:56:02.840]   Yeah.
[00:56:02.840 --> 00:56:05.720]   But he created the wall, he created photo tagging.
[00:56:05.720 --> 00:56:09.160]   I mean, there's some, you know,
[00:56:09.160 --> 00:56:12.120]   relate your, just your relationship status.
[00:56:12.120 --> 00:56:16.360]   He created some things that are sticky as hell.
[00:56:16.360 --> 00:56:17.000]   He figured out.
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:18.840]   He did, he did.
[00:56:18.840 --> 00:56:20.680]   I'm not, yeah.
[00:56:20.680 --> 00:56:21.400]   OK.
[00:56:21.400 --> 00:56:22.600]   He figured out.
[00:56:22.600 --> 00:56:25.160]   I think that these, you know, these parts of these ideas
[00:56:25.160 --> 00:56:26.600]   were in a lot of different places.
[00:56:26.600 --> 00:56:28.840]   He brought them together to one unified product,
[00:56:28.840 --> 00:56:30.200]   which I give him total credit for.
[00:56:30.200 --> 00:56:32.360]   I don't think that he invented a lot of this stuff.
[00:56:32.360 --> 00:56:32.760]   I mean,
[00:56:32.760 --> 00:56:34.840]   Well, Jobs didn't invent the mouse either.
[00:56:34.840 --> 00:56:35.960]   Right. Absolutely.
[00:56:35.960 --> 00:56:38.280]   I don't think that Jobs invent stuff.
[00:56:38.280 --> 00:56:41.320]   Jobs looks at what's out there and goes that last extra mile.
[00:56:41.320 --> 00:56:43.080]   And so I'm going to make this amazing.
[00:56:43.080 --> 00:56:43.080]   Yeah.
[00:56:43.080 --> 00:56:43.560]   Yeah.
[00:56:43.560 --> 00:56:44.120]   Yeah.
[00:56:44.120 --> 00:56:46.360]   Yeah. And that's, and that's, Zuck does that for sure.
[00:56:46.360 --> 00:56:47.080]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:56:47.080 --> 00:56:47.960]   That's what civil.
[00:56:47.960 --> 00:56:48.920]   Yeah. Maybe, maybe, maybe.
[00:56:48.920 --> 00:56:49.400]   Maybe you're right.
[00:56:49.400 --> 00:56:49.880]   That's the wrong way.
[00:56:49.880 --> 00:56:50.520]   All right.
[00:56:50.520 --> 00:56:51.160]   I'll give you that.
[00:56:51.160 --> 00:56:53.160]   It's a small difference.
[00:56:53.160 --> 00:56:53.480]   All right.
[00:56:53.480 --> 00:56:55.320]   Gawker had a big password breach,
[00:56:55.320 --> 00:56:57.080]   and I know you guys are going to have something to say about it.
[00:56:57.080 --> 00:56:58.760]   So let's take a break and come back.
[00:56:58.760 --> 00:57:02.680]   Gina Trapani is here.
[00:57:02.680 --> 00:57:05.400]   As is Joel Johnson from Gizmodo,
[00:57:05.400 --> 00:57:06.520]   Jeff Jarvis.
[00:57:06.520 --> 00:57:08.120]   We're talking Google and the cloud.
[00:57:08.120 --> 00:57:14.040]   Right now, I'd like to tell you to register your domains at hover.com.
[00:57:14.760 --> 00:57:19.320]   If you go to twig.hovered.com and get 10% off your next registration,
[00:57:19.320 --> 00:57:21.960]   hover is domain name registrations made simple.
[00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:26.920]   Without all the frills, the bells, the whistles, the upsells that the other guys do,
[00:57:26.920 --> 00:57:29.800]   you get automatic, for instance, automatic who is privacy.
[00:57:29.800 --> 00:57:30.680]   It's part of the price.
[00:57:30.680 --> 00:57:31.800]   There's no additional sell.
[00:57:31.800 --> 00:57:33.560]   They don't do hosting.
[00:57:33.560 --> 00:57:34.760]   So you're not, they're not going to say,
[00:57:34.760 --> 00:57:36.440]   "Oh, get the hosting package."
[00:57:36.440 --> 00:57:38.040]   We get all the, it's very simple.
[00:57:38.040 --> 00:57:41.560]   Domain name forwarding, email forwarding.
[00:57:43.400 --> 00:57:44.760]   You could set up email addresses.
[00:57:44.760 --> 00:57:46.520]   You create URL extensions.
[00:57:46.520 --> 00:57:48.280]   You've got privacy controls.
[00:57:48.280 --> 00:57:49.320]   It's all simple.
[00:57:49.320 --> 00:57:50.040]   It's all clean.
[00:57:50.040 --> 00:57:52.680]   It's kind of the Google of domain name registration.
[00:57:52.680 --> 00:57:53.480]   Clean interface.
[00:57:53.480 --> 00:57:55.560]   It gets the job done.
[00:57:55.560 --> 00:57:57.800]   And that's why I use hover and registered.
[00:57:57.800 --> 00:58:00.120]   I moved everything over to hover.
[00:58:00.120 --> 00:58:01.880]   All my new domain names registered at hover,
[00:58:01.880 --> 00:58:02.840]   and I couldn't be happier.
[00:58:02.840 --> 00:58:05.080]   Twig.hovered.com for 10% off.
[00:58:05.080 --> 00:58:08.040]   And by the way, you're going to love their no hold policy.
[00:58:08.040 --> 00:58:09.880]   If you've ever called these other guys,
[00:58:10.760 --> 00:58:13.480]   it's like they make more money if they put you on hold.
[00:58:13.480 --> 00:58:14.760]   The longer you're on hold,
[00:58:14.760 --> 00:58:16.360]   it's almost, I think they're playing a game with you,
[00:58:16.360 --> 00:58:17.000]   these other guys.
[00:58:17.000 --> 00:58:19.080]   How long before they hang up?
[00:58:19.080 --> 00:58:21.560]   How long can we put them on hold before they give up?
[00:58:21.560 --> 00:58:22.760]   Not with hover.
[00:58:22.760 --> 00:58:24.840]   If once, during business hours,
[00:58:24.840 --> 00:58:27.800]   when you call, you get a live person and you are,
[00:58:27.800 --> 00:58:28.840]   that's it, no hold.
[00:58:28.840 --> 00:58:29.960]   They're going to handle your problem,
[00:58:29.960 --> 00:58:32.840]   or explain what to do, or so forth.
[00:58:32.840 --> 00:58:36.680]   The domain transfers are free.
[00:58:36.680 --> 00:58:38.520]   They'll charge you 10 bucks to extend the domain.
[00:58:38.520 --> 00:58:40.520]   You'll get one more year, automatically.
[00:58:40.920 --> 00:58:43.000]   When you transfer over, that's what I did.
[00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:44.120]   Actually, I took advantage of it,
[00:58:44.120 --> 00:58:45.160]   I got four years on each one.
[00:58:45.160 --> 00:58:46.760]   Try it right now.
[00:58:46.760 --> 00:58:49.880]   We had twig.hovered.com.
[00:58:49.880 --> 00:58:55.320]   All right, so, this is, we were talking about this off the air,
[00:58:55.320 --> 00:58:57.800]   I think, but let's talk about it on the air now.
[00:58:57.800 --> 00:58:58.760]   Gawker got hacked.
[00:58:58.760 --> 00:59:01.560]   Life hacker is a Gawker property,
[00:59:01.560 --> 00:59:03.880]   but did you leave Gina before Gawker was involved?
[00:59:03.880 --> 00:59:07.480]   Life hacker was always a Gawker property.
[00:59:07.480 --> 00:59:09.560]   So you've worked for Nick.
[00:59:10.200 --> 00:59:11.960]   I worked for Nick for five years.
[00:59:11.960 --> 00:59:13.560]   I own stock of the company now.
[00:59:13.560 --> 00:59:14.040]   Sometimes I--
[00:59:14.040 --> 00:59:15.080]   Okay, good disclaimer.
[00:59:15.080 --> 00:59:15.640]   You do.
[00:59:15.640 --> 00:59:16.760]   Sometimes I say some articles from my site.
[00:59:16.760 --> 00:59:17.560]   I should--
[00:59:17.560 --> 00:59:18.120]   What's that?
[00:59:18.120 --> 00:59:19.320]   You do.
[00:59:19.320 --> 00:59:23.720]   Yeah, a lot of employees and what to do now.
[00:59:23.720 --> 00:59:24.600]   I like that.
[00:59:24.600 --> 00:59:25.880]   I should have been nicer than that.
[00:59:25.880 --> 00:59:29.560]   Joel Johnson writes for Gizmodo,
[00:59:29.560 --> 00:59:31.000]   which is, of course, a Gawker property,
[00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:33.560]   as is Gawker itself,
[00:59:33.560 --> 00:59:34.360]   ValleyWag,
[00:59:34.360 --> 00:59:35.880]   Fleshbot.
[00:59:35.880 --> 00:59:37.240]   Yes.
[00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:41.240]   I know as you guys don't talk about Fleshbot as much.
[00:59:41.240 --> 00:59:44.360]   There are separate advertising package.
[00:59:44.360 --> 00:59:47.160]   Yeah, it depends on if it's ad sales talking about Fleshbot
[00:59:47.160 --> 00:59:49.080]   or if it's editorial talking about--
[00:59:49.080 --> 00:59:51.000]   But somebody hacked the entire database.
[00:59:51.000 --> 00:59:52.200]   Now, this is what I didn't know.
[00:59:52.200 --> 00:59:54.360]   I thought it was just your routine run in the mill hack,
[00:59:54.360 --> 00:59:56.680]   but it was actually targeted.
[00:59:56.680 --> 00:59:58.840]   It was like, let's get Nick kind of.
[00:59:58.840 --> 01:00:01.880]   Yeah, I mean, that's what they said.
[01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:03.080]   That's certainly what it looks like.
[01:00:03.080 --> 01:00:05.800]   There had been, you know,
[01:00:05.800 --> 01:00:06.680]   and I--
[01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:07.560]   For what it's worth,
[01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:10.040]   I mean, I pretty much know what everybody else knows at this point.
[01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:13.400]   But, you know, they had said
[01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:15.480]   that they were going after gawker.com
[01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:17.720]   and Nick Denton in particular,
[01:00:17.720 --> 01:00:19.880]   it sounded like for their arrogance.
[01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:22.280]   That was the term, at least, that stuck with me.
[01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:25.400]   So, yeah, they made a concerted effort
[01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:29.880]   to actually penetrate and apparently had access to things for a while
[01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:31.160]   before they released it.
[01:00:31.160 --> 01:00:31.880]   Wow.
[01:00:31.880 --> 01:00:33.560]   Now, it's one thing to go after Gawker.
[01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:35.400]   It's another thing to release that information.
[01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:38.680]   Although, what did people really get?
[01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:40.120]   There's not credit card numbers in there.
[01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:43.080]   It's just passwords, most of them crappy, apparently.
[01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:45.960]   Email addresses, user names and passwords.
[01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:46.360]   Okay.
[01:00:46.360 --> 01:00:48.760]   User name and passwords, which is, you know,
[01:00:48.760 --> 01:00:51.160]   if they--
[01:00:51.160 --> 01:00:52.920]   It's a sticky situation, right?
[01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:54.760]   Like, because my instinct is to say,
[01:00:54.760 --> 01:00:57.480]   well, you shouldn't use those things on other accounts that matter.
[01:00:57.480 --> 01:01:01.960]   Like, don't use the thing that you would sign up for gawker with your bank.
[01:01:01.960 --> 01:01:05.160]   But at the same time, you know, gawker,
[01:01:05.160 --> 01:01:07.960]   we were the ones that lost the passwords and lost the emails.
[01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:08.920]   And so we--
[01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:12.840]   We're certainly not criticizing anybody if they made that mistake.
[01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:18.440]   So, I know that, you know, World of Warcraft's apparently had some problems,
[01:01:18.440 --> 01:01:21.320]   Twitter had some problems, LinkedIn sent around some emails.
[01:01:21.320 --> 01:01:24.520]   LinkedIn sent out a great message where they just made you change it.
[01:01:24.520 --> 01:01:25.640]   Right.
[01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:27.160]   Obviously, obviously, they--
[01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:29.240]   They rocked the leak.
[01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:32.200]   And if you were a gawker user, they sent you out something.
[01:01:32.200 --> 01:01:33.800]   Very smart.
[01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:34.680]   I appreciated that.
[01:01:34.680 --> 01:01:35.720]   That's interesting.
[01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:36.440]   Yeah.
[01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:40.360]   So they proactively reset passwords for any email address that showed up in the gawker data leak,
[01:01:40.360 --> 01:01:41.880]   which, you know, I think makes a lot of sense, right?
[01:01:41.880 --> 01:01:44.920]   Because it's kind of-- I mean, a lot of these were kind of like throwaway accounts.
[01:01:44.920 --> 01:01:46.760]   That was just some blog I'm going to comment on.
[01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:48.280]   It's not like financial information.
[01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:51.320]   But you also kind of might feel the same way about Twitter or Facebook or LinkedIn.
[01:01:51.320 --> 01:01:53.240]   Ah, it's just a social network, whatever.
[01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:54.200]   It's a funny, involved, yeah.
[01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:55.000]   It gets a password.
[01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.960]   So it kind of makes sense that a lot of people used a similar password
[01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:01.080]   on gawker and Twitter and LinkedIn.
[01:02:01.080 --> 01:02:05.080]   And I think it's great that-- I thought it was great that those companies proactively
[01:02:05.080 --> 01:02:09.560]   sent out emails resetting those people's passwords to avoid any problems.
[01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:15.720]   And also, there was a little bit of a kind of complaint going around that we hadn't sent out
[01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:19.320]   an email to our one-haver million plus users.
[01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:24.680]   And basically, that was happening while all these other emails were going out.
[01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:28.120]   They were figuring out the best way to send out those emails and the process for all of that.
[01:02:28.120 --> 01:02:35.400]   But to defend our tech team, at least on a human level, they were dealing with all of
[01:02:35.400 --> 01:02:40.440]   the nightmare of the hack while at the same time trying to figure out the logistics and the
[01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:45.080]   etiquette of emailing a million and a half users all at once.
[01:02:45.080 --> 01:02:47.320]   It took them longer.
[01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:51.880]   We definitely got caught with our pants down.
[01:02:54.360 --> 01:03:00.760]   The political aspect of it aside, the idea that our users should be punished because
[01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:07.560]   a handful of people don't like our attitude aside, it was a real bummer that we dropped the ball on
[01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:08.360]   that one for sure.
[01:03:08.360 --> 01:03:14.920]   Yeah, I mean, I was going to say, it was a horrible week.
[01:03:14.920 --> 01:03:17.480]   For me, it was really kind of outside of the company at this point.
[01:03:17.480 --> 01:03:22.040]   It was just watching this terrible freeway rack unfold.
[01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:23.880]   It's like slow motion.
[01:03:23.880 --> 01:03:24.920]   It was really bad.
[01:03:24.920 --> 01:03:29.160]   And what's hard for me, because most of the tech team are my friends, Tom Plunkett is
[01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:30.120]   CTO, a friend of mine.
[01:03:30.120 --> 01:03:31.400]   I introduced him to Nick.
[01:03:31.400 --> 01:03:32.280]   He knows better.
[01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:36.440]   This wasn't like a lack of technical ability on the part of our engineers,
[01:03:36.440 --> 01:03:39.560]   because most of the articles written about this, especially in the tech press,
[01:03:39.560 --> 01:03:46.840]   or about how bad the encryption was and how terrible and weak the MySQL database password was.
[01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:50.120]   But the reality is in that startup world, especially tech startup world,
[01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:55.400]   especially in dent in the startup world, putting time and resources toward infrastructure
[01:03:55.400 --> 01:03:56.760]   is not as high a priority.
[01:03:56.760 --> 01:03:58.920]   It's about shipping new stuff.
[01:03:58.920 --> 01:04:03.400]   And I think this was just mortifying and embarrassing for the tech team and for editorial,
[01:04:03.400 --> 01:04:06.920]   especially the editorial of the tech sites at LifeHacker and Gizmodo.
[01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:09.880]   And it was a hard lesson learned for sure.
[01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:11.560]   I got to point out that this happens all the time.
[01:04:11.560 --> 01:04:17.800]   At the same time that this happened, people who Walmart sent out emails to many of its customers,
[01:04:17.800 --> 01:04:22.040]   their accounts had been breached with much more serious data in there.
[01:04:22.040 --> 01:04:23.560]   I mean, this happens all the time.
[01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:26.680]   It does, but it still really stinks.
[01:04:26.680 --> 01:04:27.720]   It's embarrassing.
[01:04:27.720 --> 01:04:33.640]   And it makes people think, you know, it's hard to be, you know, people have short memories,
[01:04:33.640 --> 01:04:36.120]   but it's also still just rough when it's happened.
[01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:37.960]   And they said that there are going to be future releases.
[01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:40.360]   So we don't even know what else that they have if they haven't released yet.
[01:04:40.360 --> 01:04:42.280]   I don't think anybody's going to hold this against Walker.
[01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:43.640]   I really do.
[01:04:43.640 --> 01:04:44.280]   Yeah.
[01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:46.280]   As far as what they're talking about future releases,
[01:04:46.280 --> 01:04:48.840]   I can't imagine what they would have that would be.
[01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:53.480]   I mean, because it should knock on wood, but I can't imagine that it's going to be worse.
[01:04:53.480 --> 01:04:58.040]   I think there's a lot of the stuff that they were pulling out of campfire, for instance,
[01:04:58.040 --> 01:05:02.360]   that they were throwing in our face, like, see the arrogance of these people.
[01:05:02.360 --> 01:05:06.040]   And that's just people joking in IRC and campfire.
[01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:07.800]   And it's just people talking.
[01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:11.320]   So we'll see what happens.
[01:05:11.320 --> 01:05:17.160]   But I definitely have to underline what Gina said is like,
[01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:22.360]   at Walker, to step out of as an employee role and more just like me and my experience with
[01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:27.640]   Walker over the years, like the tag team has always kind of gotten short shrift financially,
[01:05:27.640 --> 01:05:32.360]   you know, and they've always had to really make magic happen with just a little bit of
[01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:35.320]   far less resources than they probably should have.
[01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:38.520]   So they've, you know, they're not dumb.
[01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:39.960]   They weren't careless.
[01:05:39.960 --> 01:05:42.040]   Everybody made mistakes.
[01:05:42.040 --> 01:05:45.000]   There were mistakes made on a security standpoint,
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:45.720]   company-wide.
[01:05:45.720 --> 01:05:51.400]   Like we were never as strident about, you know, changing passwords and all of that stuff now,
[01:05:51.400 --> 01:05:54.280]   or all of that stuff as we are now.
[01:05:54.280 --> 01:05:56.280]   But yeah, that tag team always worked really hard.
[01:05:56.280 --> 01:05:59.720]   And it's totally the last week of been beat up.
[01:05:59.720 --> 01:06:05.240]   Moving on, I want to talk about some Google acquisitions, Google hires.
[01:06:06.920 --> 01:06:07.960]   Google was very busy.
[01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:09.560]   We haven't talked about Google books yet.
[01:06:09.560 --> 01:06:10.840]   Did you talk about that last week?
[01:06:10.840 --> 01:06:11.960]   We did.
[01:06:11.960 --> 01:06:12.440]   We did.
[01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:13.800]   OK, so we don't have to mention that.
[01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:15.800]   What did you say about it?
[01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:20.120]   Oh, yeah, we talked about how it was kind of a good thing.
[01:06:20.120 --> 01:06:25.000]   I talked about, you know, we talked about the Android app and Jeff's book is on Google
[01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:25.320]   Books.
[01:06:25.320 --> 01:06:26.440]   Mine is not.
[01:06:26.440 --> 01:06:27.960]   Yeah, just kind of neat.
[01:06:27.960 --> 01:06:31.000]   The problem is you can't mark text, which just drives me nutty.
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:32.040]   It would you can in the Kindle.
[01:06:32.040 --> 01:06:34.760]   Yeah, it's not quite as fully baked as the Kindle.
[01:06:34.760 --> 01:06:37.640]   But you know, the Kindle wasn't fully baked when it came out either.
[01:06:37.640 --> 01:06:38.280]   Right.
[01:06:38.280 --> 01:06:40.520]   It's first generation, although you think they might have learned from
[01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:43.160]   what other stuff does.
[01:06:43.160 --> 01:06:45.000]   I just downloaded it.
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:46.040]   I haven't bought anything yet.
[01:06:46.040 --> 01:06:48.760]   I mean, I'm always going to buy stuff through the Kindle store because I have.
[01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:49.160]   It works.
[01:06:49.160 --> 01:06:49.800]   It works well.
[01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:52.200]   It reads nicely on my Galaxy tab.
[01:06:52.200 --> 01:06:53.240]   I'm liking it.
[01:06:53.240 --> 01:06:53.800]   That's a thing.
[01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:55.160]   Yeah, I'm kind of invested in Kindle.
[01:06:55.160 --> 01:06:58.280]   And when I think I want to buy books online, I think Amazon, I don't think Google.
[01:06:58.280 --> 01:07:03.800]   Speaking of book readers, the Nook, you know, which is an Android based device,
[01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:05.880]   but kind of a hobbled Android based device.
[01:07:05.880 --> 01:07:07.960]   But a lot of people are reviewing it very positively.
[01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:10.680]   It's color, the new Nook, it's backlit, running Android.
[01:07:10.680 --> 01:07:15.240]   And now the latest rumor is that Barnes and Noble is going to put Froyo on it
[01:07:15.240 --> 01:07:16.200]   in the next couple of months.
[01:07:16.200 --> 01:07:17.960]   And it will be an actual tablet.
[01:07:17.960 --> 01:07:25.000]   Yeah, that was a pretty amazing backdoor attack on getting into the Android tablet market.
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:25.560]   No kidding.
[01:07:25.560 --> 01:07:26.200]   Yeah.
[01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:29.960]   It's still going to be a little weak, hardware-wise.
[01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:30.680]   It's not very fast.
[01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:31.560]   What is the processor?
[01:07:32.920 --> 01:07:34.040]   I don't remember.
[01:07:34.040 --> 01:07:37.560]   It's not nearly as snappy as the Samsung, for instance.
[01:07:37.560 --> 01:07:37.800]   Right.
[01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:41.560]   A lot of this product is how you--
[01:07:41.560 --> 01:07:44.360]   By the way, Barnes and Noble is denying that, but I don't know if that means anything.
[01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:44.920]   Yeah.
[01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:45.080]   Yeah.
[01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:47.240]   A lot of this product stuff is just approach, right?
[01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:51.000]   Like, if you sell something as an ebook reader and then say,
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:55.000]   "Oh, but it'll also be a tablet if you want to use that later on."
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:58.440]   People are going to be far less critical than saying, "This is a new tablet."
[01:07:58.440 --> 01:07:58.680]   So--
[01:07:58.680 --> 01:07:59.960]   Well, it's $249.
[01:07:59.960 --> 01:08:00.440]   It's cheap.
[01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:05.000]   It's a lot cheaper than the Samsung.
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:05.800]   Darn straight.
[01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:06.280]   Yeah.
[01:08:06.280 --> 01:08:06.760]   $500.
[01:08:06.760 --> 01:08:09.480]   Can you get the Kindle app on it?
[01:08:09.480 --> 01:08:13.160]   Well, that's interesting.
[01:08:13.160 --> 01:08:15.400]   If you had the Android marketplace, I guess you could.
[01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:20.920]   That might be the single biggest reason why Barnes and Noble will not do this.
[01:08:20.920 --> 01:08:21.480]   Right.
[01:08:21.480 --> 01:08:21.800]   Right.
[01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:25.640]   Because it's kind of undermines their store.
[01:08:25.640 --> 01:08:26.600]   Well, I want choices.
[01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:30.440]   Hey, I bought Kindle books and I would like to get them on my e-reader or tablet.
[01:08:30.440 --> 01:08:30.680]   Yeah.
[01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:33.800]   The other thing we didn't talk about last week that I don't understand is how
[01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:38.520]   Google Books evidently will work with the small bookstore now and you can make it--
[01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:39.480]   which makes some sense.
[01:08:39.480 --> 01:08:41.320]   Bookstores should become a showroom.
[01:08:41.320 --> 01:08:41.640]   Oh.
[01:08:41.640 --> 01:08:43.560]   And you then just order the book otherwise.
[01:08:43.560 --> 01:08:44.200]   That's good.
[01:08:44.200 --> 01:08:45.080]   You really have to have it then.
[01:08:45.080 --> 01:08:45.400]   Fine.
[01:08:45.400 --> 01:08:46.200]   Pay premium.
[01:08:46.200 --> 01:08:47.320]   I like that.
[01:08:47.320 --> 01:08:47.480]   Yeah.
[01:08:47.480 --> 01:08:49.240]   I mean, it looks like it's just a web-based partnership.
[01:08:49.240 --> 01:08:54.760]   So, like, if you go to a Powell's website, I'll say, "Hey, buy e-books online powered by Google Books."
[01:08:54.760 --> 01:08:56.760]   I think that's how it works.
[01:08:56.760 --> 01:08:57.560]   Well, that's awesome.
[01:08:57.560 --> 01:09:01.000]   And then Powell still gets the business and the traffic.
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:02.000]   Yeah.
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:03.000]   Maybe they get a cut.
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:03.720]   And some revenue.
[01:09:03.720 --> 01:09:05.000]   Well, I'm sure they would.
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:08.280]   So, they're in a really smart position against Amazon.
[01:09:08.280 --> 01:09:09.960]   Amazon's killed all these books.
[01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:10.760]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:12.840]   Oh, you know, I would tell you what.
[01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:18.200]   If that's the case, I would absolutely move to the Google Books platform just to keep those
[01:09:18.200 --> 01:09:20.120]   local bookstores around.
[01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:24.120]   I think that's actually a very compelling argument in favor of that.
[01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:27.560]   Well, then the idea, I think, again, is you change--
[01:09:27.560 --> 01:09:29.320]   I think bookstores should change the model.
[01:09:30.040 --> 01:09:33.640]   You know, they've got to figure out how to change the model so that it's not about holding inventory,
[01:09:33.640 --> 01:09:38.600]   even though the inventory risk is the publisher is not the bookstores, but there's still a cost
[01:09:38.600 --> 01:09:39.640]   issue there.
[01:09:39.640 --> 01:09:43.720]   And if it became more of a reading room showroom, "Hey, you want to read this when you leave?"
[01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:49.640]   And in a sense, Barnes & Noble's headed there, since you can, as I understand, you can read any book,
[01:09:49.640 --> 01:09:52.520]   electronic book, while you're in the store.
[01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:54.760]   Yeah.
[01:09:54.760 --> 01:09:55.320]   Right.
[01:09:55.320 --> 01:09:59.720]   So, if you want to leaf through or look at things like that and get a sense of it and read,
[01:09:59.720 --> 01:10:04.360]   you know, just flip pages and all that, fine, hold on to two copies of every book.
[01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:10.040]   And then-- but have a far larger selection of books, so your inventory risk.
[01:10:10.040 --> 01:10:13.160]   And if you really want to have it, fine, you can buy this one, but you're going to pay full
[01:10:13.160 --> 01:10:13.720]   retail.
[01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:18.120]   Well, independent bookstores do so many other things, including, you know, speakers and--
[01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:20.280]   I mean, it's really a important part of the community.
[01:10:20.280 --> 01:10:22.120]   I would love to keep them around.
[01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:23.320]   And that's great.
[01:10:23.320 --> 01:10:25.320]   But when's the last time you went to a local bookstore?
[01:10:25.320 --> 01:10:27.240]   It's been a while.
[01:10:27.240 --> 01:10:28.280]   We have one down the street.
[01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:31.960]   But my wife goes and my kids go.
[01:10:31.960 --> 01:10:35.480]   Yeah. The worst question for me at all before I started writing the latest book and doing
[01:10:35.480 --> 01:10:37.080]   research is when's the last time I read a book?
[01:10:37.080 --> 01:10:41.000]   I read books all the time.
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:41.800]   It's a little--
[01:10:41.800 --> 01:10:43.320]   I live in Portland now.
[01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:46.920]   And so, you know, the big Powell's is obviously here.
[01:10:46.920 --> 01:10:50.360]   But the last time-- like, the last three times, I think, that I've been to Powell's,
[01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:55.560]   was when I've been taking books to sell back to Powell's and then just walking out with
[01:10:55.560 --> 01:10:59.160]   cash and not buying any more books. So I'm part of the problem.
[01:10:59.160 --> 01:11:04.280]   Okay. One thing I'm really unhappy about, the change to the refund policy in the Google
[01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:08.040]   marketplace. They're improving the Google marketplace. The new marketplace should be rolling out now.
[01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:12.680]   Lots of nice features, except instead of 24 hours to return a program, now you have 15 minutes.
[01:11:12.680 --> 01:11:14.520]   Whoa.
[01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:15.160]   Not so good.
[01:11:15.160 --> 01:11:21.320]   This was-- to me, one of the chief selling points of Android over the iPhone is you could try any
[01:11:21.320 --> 01:11:26.840]   application in the marketplace. And if you didn't like it, return it and get your money back.
[01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:28.200]   You can do that on iPhone.
[01:11:28.200 --> 01:11:29.560]   How's that?
[01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:36.280]   I feel like I'm probably tipping a hat that I shouldn't give, but I've gotten tons into--
[01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:41.240]   all of the App Store stuff for Apple is handled-- all the refunds and all of that stuff is handled by
[01:11:41.240 --> 01:11:47.160]   Apple. So you pretty much just have to file for a refund and they'll give you a refund for almost
[01:11:47.160 --> 01:11:47.560]   anything.
[01:11:47.560 --> 01:11:50.440]   Really? So you just say, "I don't like it. Give me my money back," and they will?
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:54.280]   Pretty much. How many times could you get to do that before they say, "Get out of here?"
[01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:59.640]   I've probably had 10 things over the last couple years that I've given back.
[01:11:59.640 --> 01:12:00.040]   Yeah.
[01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:01.880]   So there's a nice little thing.
[01:12:01.880 --> 01:12:06.680]   But it's clearly a soft policy. It's not something they have kind of clearly marked.
[01:12:06.680 --> 01:12:07.800]   I didn't know you could do that.
[01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:13.640]   I think that somebody told me the reason that the Google change is 24 to 15 is because people
[01:12:13.640 --> 01:12:18.680]   were buying games and beating them in less than 24 hours and then returning them.
[01:12:18.680 --> 01:12:22.360]   And I guess if you're an avid game player, that makes sense. I can't imagine doing that.
[01:12:22.360 --> 01:12:24.840]   That seems like that's nuts.
[01:12:24.840 --> 01:12:28.120]   Yeah. If you put that effort, go ahead. Get your refund.
[01:12:28.120 --> 01:12:34.040]   Yeah, really. Take your money back. Maybe it seems-- this is obviously a change
[01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:39.640]   in response to developers. And it's the kind of thing I don't like because what it is is it's
[01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:45.320]   saying to developers, "All right, we're going to respond to your interests over and above that of our
[01:12:46.040 --> 01:12:47.640]   users." And I hate to do that.
[01:12:47.640 --> 01:12:48.840]   That's a big jump, too.
[01:12:48.840 --> 01:12:50.280]   Yeah.
[01:12:50.280 --> 01:12:54.680]   I can understand needing a few hours to kind of get a handle on something before you know
[01:12:54.680 --> 01:12:55.480]   if it's going to work enough.
[01:12:55.480 --> 01:12:56.120]   15 minutes.
[01:12:56.120 --> 01:12:57.080]   It's nothing.
[01:12:57.080 --> 01:13:02.040]   That's basically-- 15 minutes is not-- you can test this and see if you like it.
[01:13:02.040 --> 01:13:04.120]   15 minutes is, "I accidentally bought this."
[01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:04.600]   Right.
[01:13:04.600 --> 01:13:06.440]   That's really the only scenario that covers.
[01:13:06.440 --> 01:13:13.080]   And boyhead, go ahead and try to get a refund from Google like you do from Apple.
[01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:15.720]   The Python support's not going to let you do that.
[01:13:15.720 --> 01:13:16.840]   We'll say that right now.
[01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:18.280]   Topic.py doesn't confuse--
[01:13:18.280 --> 01:13:21.400]   Refund.py.
[01:13:21.400 --> 01:13:25.000]   Hey, let's take a break when we come back. Lots more to talk about.
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:27.560]   And I will play that onion bit. It's very funny.
[01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:32.040]   And it's got a little dig at the Yahoo at the end of it as well.
[01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:33.640]   So you're going to put that back?
[01:13:33.640 --> 01:13:37.800]   Well, yeah, I think anonymous or lentered.
[01:13:40.600 --> 01:13:44.520]   I do want to mention our friends at General Electric, the creators of the GE E-E-CO
[01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:46.440]   imagination challenge.
[01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:53.320]   I don't want to say a contest, but I guess it wasn't a way a competition among inventors, innovators,
[01:13:53.320 --> 01:14:02.520]   people who start up folks to really reinvent how we use energy.
[01:14:02.520 --> 01:14:09.720]   Entrepreneurs, business innovators, and students competed for $200 million in investment capital
[01:14:09.720 --> 01:14:11.880]   from General Electric in three categories.
[01:14:11.880 --> 01:14:17.640]   Renewable energy to encourage things like wind, water, and the sun.
[01:14:17.640 --> 01:14:24.920]   Grid efficiency. Everybody's talking about the smart grid in years past.
[01:14:24.920 --> 01:14:30.760]   Now they want to talk about the digital energy and some very interesting ideas
[01:14:30.760 --> 01:14:33.800]   came out of the E-CO imagination challenge there.
[01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:38.760]   To improve transparency at every step of the grid, to reduce ways to give more choices for
[01:14:38.760 --> 01:14:40.440]   consumers and energy providers.
[01:14:40.440 --> 01:14:48.840]   And then finally, green homes and buildings, because of course we've got to reduce consumption
[01:14:48.840 --> 01:14:49.800]   as well.
[01:14:49.800 --> 01:14:57.960]   If you go to eco-imagination.com/challenge right now, you can see the weiners, the people who
[01:14:57.960 --> 01:15:02.280]   are participating in this $200 million investment.
[01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:09.640]   Some really great ideas for changing the way we use energy, we create energy, we distribute energy.
[01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:13.320]   Really a great project. Great ideas kept on.
[01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:16.360]   Great ideas kept on.
[01:15:16.360 --> 01:15:21.000]   I invite you to visit at eco-imagination.com/challenge to find out more.
[01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:24.680]   And by the way, watch our green tech today show because we've got a lot of these innovators on it.
[01:15:24.680 --> 01:15:28.920]   General Electric sponsoring the show and we're very proud of it.
[01:15:28.920 --> 01:15:35.880]   It's a twit.tv/gtt or you can find it on iTunes or the Zoom store anywhere you can find podcasts.
[01:15:35.880 --> 01:15:40.280]   Green Tech today. Thank you General Electric for making that possible and for sponsoring
[01:15:40.280 --> 01:15:41.880]   the E-CO imagination challenge.
[01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:46.120]   Eco-imagination.com/challenge.
[01:15:46.120 --> 01:15:52.920]   So Jeff, you tweeted something about Google and acquisitions.
[01:15:52.920 --> 01:15:55.000]   What was that all?
[01:15:55.000 --> 01:16:02.360]   Right. There was a Washington Post column that argued that I was wacky because it's from a
[01:16:02.360 --> 01:16:07.160]   business writer who just said, "Well, I don't have any problem with Google being big and doing
[01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:10.920]   things on their own, but I really disagree with it. They should be able to grow with requisition."
[01:16:10.920 --> 01:16:15.880]   And arguing that they should be regulated on anti-trust basis for that.
[01:16:15.880 --> 01:16:23.000]   What? No. Sense what so ever. And it's the business section of the Washington Post.
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:28.120]   It's just unfair on the face of it. Why should Google be hobbled artificially like that?
[01:16:28.120 --> 01:16:33.800]   Game any called Cisco. Every time there's a downturn, Cisco probably has arguably
[01:16:33.800 --> 01:16:37.560]   nearly the monopoly of part of the communications business.
[01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:43.000]   Go a little far there. But I don't know what Cisco's market share.
[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:47.640]   Probably 80%. I mean, it's huge, right?
[01:16:47.640 --> 01:16:53.160]   Right. And Google is 63% or something like that in the US. And how does Cisco grow?
[01:16:53.160 --> 01:16:57.640]   Well, Chamber is Braggs all the time by buying, buying, buying. So Google came back and responded
[01:16:57.640 --> 01:17:03.640]   to this as well. They should have very smart immediately the same day and wrote a blog post up
[01:17:03.640 --> 01:17:11.400]   on their own blog saying that this is ridiculous and we're not anti-trust and we're just doing
[01:17:11.400 --> 01:17:17.800]   business the way you do business. But at the same time, the pardon me, stupid French,
[01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:24.840]   just the government goes attacking this look at me tweets. Oh, this look at me tweets.
[01:17:24.840 --> 01:17:31.720]   The Google eating surrender monkeys of France wrote this ridiculous announcement trying to
[01:17:31.720 --> 01:17:36.600]   argue that Google's responsible for the death of news. It called links parasitic.
[01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:37.480]   Oh, please.
[01:17:37.480 --> 01:17:42.840]   Miss up here's my favorite part. They complained that that you can't pull out of Google news
[01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:46.040]   without pulling out a Google search, which is true.
[01:17:46.040 --> 01:17:46.520]   That's not true.
[01:17:46.520 --> 01:17:52.360]   Hattenly wrong as Mr. Murdoch. All you have to do is do is search and they publicly attack Google
[01:17:52.360 --> 01:17:54.040]   without a friggin fact.
[01:17:54.040 --> 01:17:56.040]   Right. They didn't even think they could Google that.
[01:17:56.040 --> 01:18:01.480]   Exactly. Oh, you got to do it. I tell you, let me make sure I went to Google News. No
[01:18:01.480 --> 01:18:05.240]   times of London. Go to Google search times of London. Look on the songs. Boom, tons of stuff.
[01:18:06.120 --> 01:18:09.320]   The tour de de la caca.
[01:18:09.320 --> 01:18:14.760]   So Google becomes the whipping boy. The phrase that I hear again and again and again,
[01:18:14.760 --> 01:18:19.480]   this is what came out in the Washington Post piece. I heard in the interview today from the BBC,
[01:18:19.480 --> 01:18:24.760]   is Google too big? I keep saying, show me the definition of big.
[01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:31.800]   And it's almost an anti-capitalistic view that well, but they're just too big.
[01:18:31.800 --> 01:18:35.720]   Right. I don't think it's that. I think it's a real fear of the power, not the size, but the
[01:18:35.720 --> 01:18:43.320]   power that Google exerts. Yeah, but Leo. Okay, fine. So the issue in Europe is
[01:18:43.320 --> 01:18:51.800]   the idea that they can do two things. The number one, they can favor their own sites. Well, name me
[01:18:51.800 --> 01:18:59.000]   a media brand that doesn't. Right. Go to the table. Yeah, that was our next topic was this.
[01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:05.400]   And it's true. I see at Google's defense is what we're just doing what our viewers want. They're
[01:19:05.400 --> 01:19:08.920]   not even saying, well, we're favoring our own sites. They're just saying this makes our search
[01:19:08.920 --> 01:19:16.520]   results better. And it's true. And even if they did favor their own stuff, name me a company that
[01:19:16.520 --> 01:19:20.360]   doesn't. Google was the first media company that stopped doing that. Again, today's show,
[01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:24.840]   you're going to see what are they? What are they promote? NBC shows. Yahoo, what are they
[01:19:24.840 --> 01:19:30.440]   promote? Yahoo stuff. AOL, or they promote AOL stuff. That's the way the world operates.
[01:19:30.440 --> 01:19:33.560]   And Google pulled back from that. So that's the first thing they're complaining of. The second
[01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:39.400]   thing that complaining against Google we've discussed before is that they do have power of God when
[01:19:39.400 --> 01:19:46.120]   it comes to deciding, and this is Matt Cots, whether you're, you know, a spam site or legit site.
[01:19:46.120 --> 01:19:51.080]   And I have argued that that that gets them in trouble. And they should have my ideas. They have
[01:19:51.080 --> 01:19:57.000]   a jury appears to decide those things. But those are the two cases here. So the argument,
[01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:04.280]   yeah, you say that Leo about power. But I don't want to get smashed for this. Google's not all
[01:20:04.280 --> 01:20:08.360]   powerful. It's not that powerful. It's a perception. It's a the issue.
[01:20:08.360 --> 01:20:12.440]   We're running out of time. We got to get out of here for
[01:20:12.440 --> 01:20:16.600]   Tech News today. So I just want to go through a couple more stories. Milo Medin, the guy who
[01:20:16.600 --> 01:20:21.000]   started at home, were very, very famous prominent network engineer, one of the smartest guys in
[01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:27.160]   the business, if you ask me, just named by Google to run their broadband initiative. He will be the
[01:20:27.160 --> 01:20:35.800]   person, I guess, who will announce which city or cities get the Google, you know, gigabit broadband.
[01:20:35.800 --> 01:20:42.360]   Oh boy. Yeah. Milo's great. I will try to ever to get him on. I don't think nobody understands
[01:20:42.360 --> 01:20:47.880]   infrastructure better than Milo. I got to say this, when he was excited at home, he was the guy who
[01:20:47.880 --> 01:20:52.920]   was trying to do paid period deals. Oh, interesting. And so you, you know, he was
[01:20:52.920 --> 01:20:57.240]   going, he was not Mr. Net Neutral in that age. Interesting. He was trying to go to the exact
[01:20:57.240 --> 01:21:02.760]   opposite and charge more as the ISP to give you favored treatment through.
[01:21:02.760 --> 01:21:09.960]   He lost that by the way. He lost it and beware. Yeah. I can't imagine him. That was the very
[01:21:09.960 --> 01:21:14.680]   early days. Things, you know, maybe the shape of the net was not clear yet. We should get him all
[01:21:14.680 --> 01:21:20.040]   on an ask. Yeah, I'd love to. All right. Let's get the, the, a little bit of this onion video
[01:21:20.040 --> 01:21:28.440]   and then our tip and tool and pick of the week. This is from the Onion News Network.
[01:21:28.440 --> 01:21:39.960]   The Google phone is slashing monthly fees thanks to an ad supported service that whispers ads
[01:21:39.960 --> 01:21:45.240]   right into your ear. Jeff Tate has more. Thanks, Glenn. At a shareholders meeting yesterday,
[01:21:45.240 --> 01:21:51.000]   Google announced steep price cuts made possible by a revolutionary new voice recognition software
[01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:56.680]   that can detect keywords in users, by the way, and verbally suggest related products and services.
[01:21:56.680 --> 01:22:02.760]   The best faked press conference I've ever seen. If this is not completely credible,
[01:22:02.760 --> 01:22:06.600]   you know, I don't know how they did this.
[01:22:21.480 --> 01:22:27.320]   Steve Billzner, Google spokesman, who it's exactly right. Actually looks like Mac Cuts.
[01:22:27.320 --> 01:22:31.640]   They didn't have a second voice whispering in their ear. Tech publication reviews have indeed
[01:22:31.640 --> 01:22:36.200]   been enthusiastic. Hello. Hey, mom. Mother's Day kids, plants chocolate, six, I'm doing the
[01:22:36.200 --> 01:22:41.240]   cup of red. You want to know it's fairly costing me a thing. Google also will be further offsetting
[01:22:41.240 --> 01:22:54.360]   consumer costs with ad based ringtones. It's pretty as it's three loaded dozens of new applications
[01:22:54.360 --> 01:22:58.760]   into the phone, including a GPS system that gives directions to sponsor businesses. There's a
[01:22:58.760 --> 01:23:03.960]   Dunkin Donuts in 0.6 miles. Let's go. Come on. Let's go to Dunkin Donuts. As well as state of the
[01:23:03.960 --> 01:23:12.120]   art camera software with subtle advertising imagery. Find the ad system as a possible safety concern
[01:23:12.120 --> 01:23:16.520]   pointing to a recent 911 call placed by a base in my favorite of the Google phone service.
[01:23:16.520 --> 01:23:20.120]   I just I don't know what happened. I just crashed my car. I just get it off the car.
[01:23:20.120 --> 01:23:25.000]   I'm totally at the coma starting an under 16. I'm sorry. I can't understand. Hello. Can you hear me?
[01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:27.160]   I wasn't here, but she's not moving.
[01:23:27.160 --> 01:23:30.760]   I'm on the vacation of her dreams. I'm going to get away from street resorts.com.
[01:23:30.760 --> 01:23:37.080]   Sir, I need you to speak up. Google has promised to resolve the issue in upgrades.
[01:23:37.080 --> 01:23:42.040]   In the meantime, Google has promised to resolve the issue in upgrades. This is so great. Google is
[01:23:42.040 --> 01:23:46.680]   testing out cost cutting software that will make it possible for your phone to call members of your
[01:23:46.680 --> 01:23:52.200]   contact list and mimic your voice while advertising products. Here's a sneak preview of what my
[01:23:52.200 --> 01:23:56.760]   friends would hear. Hello. Hey, just wanted to say hi and tell you about job opportunities at
[01:23:56.760 --> 01:24:02.360]   Montgomery.com.com. That job listings posted daily. Have jobs emailed to you. Sign up and find your time time.
[01:24:02.360 --> 01:24:07.400]   For time trends. I'm the real Jeff Tate. Yeah, who's also announced plans to enter the smartphone
[01:24:07.400 --> 01:24:18.120]   market, the Y phone, which will license current Google. The Fisher Breaks
[01:24:18.120 --> 01:24:26.280]   Y phone. Why? Why? Why? Oh, Onion News Network. I played the whole thing. So
[01:24:26.280 --> 01:24:30.280]   I really, really going to get screwed for that. Forget impulse. Yeah, we're going to get
[01:24:30.280 --> 01:24:33.880]   impulse. You're just going to yank us. Gina Trapani, your tip of the week.
[01:24:33.880 --> 01:24:39.800]   Gmail launched delegation this week. I think just yesterday, this means that you can give
[01:24:39.800 --> 01:24:46.280]   another account, another Gmail account access to read and send email as you to your account. So
[01:24:46.280 --> 01:24:51.080]   like if you have a family account, you want your spouse to be able to check and send email from it.
[01:24:51.080 --> 01:24:55.720]   Or if you have an assistant who you want to help you, you know, who you want to help you send
[01:24:55.720 --> 01:24:59.240]   you, you know, respond to email, you can do that. So the person who has access to read and write
[01:24:59.240 --> 01:25:04.280]   email can't change your password, can't change your settings, can just see your email and help
[01:25:04.280 --> 01:25:07.080]   you out with it. So this makes me really want to hire a virtual assistant now.
[01:25:07.080 --> 01:25:14.200]   Delegation. By the way, I told the folks who are talking to the Google Docs, folks,
[01:25:14.200 --> 01:25:18.680]   how grateful you were that you could now use your regular Google Gmail account with Google
[01:25:18.680 --> 01:25:23.160]   Google Apps. They were. Yes. Yes. That's the G-H-Pawnee feature.
[01:25:23.160 --> 01:25:27.560]   That has been really nice. Google Apps is getting parody now. It's great.
[01:25:27.560 --> 01:25:31.880]   Jeff Jarvis, your number of the weeks, sir. Number of the week is number one,
[01:25:31.880 --> 01:25:37.000]   I propose to this being Mark Zuckerberg Day, a holiday soon to be celebrated, actually.
[01:25:38.360 --> 01:25:44.920]   Is that Facebook is the number one place to work. And in the same survey of places to work,
[01:25:44.920 --> 01:25:52.600]   Google fell from 14th to 30th. Apple rose two notches to 20th. Zuckerberg,
[01:25:52.600 --> 01:25:57.480]   himself, gets a 95% approval rating, which I think is by employees, which is really interesting.
[01:25:57.480 --> 01:26:02.360]   Some employees. Wow. That's really. Yeah. But what got me was Steve Jobs got a 97% approval rating,
[01:26:02.360 --> 01:26:05.240]   and I thought he was the SOB boss of all time, wouldn't he?
[01:26:06.360 --> 01:26:12.440]   Well, you don't want to cross it. Yeah. As folks at Gizmodo well, no.
[01:26:12.440 --> 01:26:19.240]   Do you ever get invited any Apple events anymore, Joel? Yeah, we are not invited to Apple events
[01:26:19.240 --> 01:26:24.680]   anymore, which is fine, actually. It hasn't really affected our ability to do Apple coverage at all.
[01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:29.720]   But I actually kind of miss the one thing I do miss is some of the Apple PR people that handle
[01:26:29.720 --> 01:26:35.400]   like the apps or like, you know, final cut and things like that are I really like them.
[01:26:35.400 --> 01:26:37.880]   And I can't talk to them because they won't even talk to you.
[01:26:37.880 --> 01:26:42.040]   Well, not not an official capacity. Like, yeah, they don't even they don't answer emails.
[01:26:42.040 --> 01:26:45.880]   If we send an email to an Apple.com address, it just it never comes back.
[01:26:45.880 --> 01:26:51.560]   Wow. And I thought I was out. Are you sure? Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,
[01:26:51.560 --> 01:26:55.560]   are we sure that it wasn't Apple that hacked you? It could be could be
[01:26:55.560 --> 01:27:00.920]   Apple went after Gawker. Gnosis. Could be could be.
[01:27:00.920 --> 01:27:05.720]   Me the most elegant. On Tuesday with three letters, Bell's Apple.
[01:27:05.720 --> 01:27:12.680]   My my tool of the week is a keyboard replacement. Now we've talked about swipe before, which I
[01:27:12.680 --> 01:27:18.840]   still love. But I tried this Swift key. Now, if you get gingerbread, much of the functionality
[01:27:18.840 --> 01:27:23.960]   from Swift key is in gingerbread. But if you don't have gingerbread yet, I really do like Swift key
[01:27:23.960 --> 01:27:29.080]   is it is back to tapping. It's not swiping. It's not drawing, but it does
[01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:35.400]   really excellent prediction. So much so that if you type something a lot, it will remember your
[01:27:35.400 --> 01:27:40.600]   phrases and you can actually type an entire phrase just by hitting space space space space
[01:27:40.600 --> 01:27:45.880]   and letting it just fill in your text. Swift key, it's not free, but I think you can
[01:27:45.880 --> 01:27:52.360]   try it for free for a month on on your Android phone. And I have to say that I suspect Google
[01:27:52.360 --> 01:27:57.320]   was influenced by it because many of those features are now in the gingerbread keyboard.
[01:27:57.320 --> 01:28:00.840]   Swift key is great. It's got a lot of fans. Isn't it? Did you still use swipe?
[01:28:00.840 --> 01:28:04.560]   I'm using slide it.
[01:28:04.560 --> 01:28:09.080]   Slide it. Yeah, I kind of yeah, which is a swipe. It's the same same idea. Same same.
[01:28:09.080 --> 01:28:13.080]   Yeah, but I really went back and forth to Swift key and I can't decide, you know.
[01:28:13.080 --> 01:28:16.840]   Yeah, it's tough. Yeah. What's great is we have the choice.
[01:28:16.840 --> 01:28:20.440]   Yes. I couldn't use swipe with my Galaxy tab.
[01:28:20.440 --> 01:28:23.160]   I don't think it comes with swipe. Because it's a big thing.
[01:28:23.160 --> 01:28:25.640]   Yeah, I don't think it works for I don't see how I would use it.
[01:28:25.640 --> 01:28:27.000]   You can't use it if you want to thumb type.
[01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:27.720]   Thumbets. Right.
[01:28:27.720 --> 01:28:31.400]   But it does come with it, right? I mean, I think as I remember.
[01:28:31.400 --> 01:28:32.760]   Yeah, it is a choice. Yes.
[01:28:32.760 --> 01:28:33.480]   Yeah, it is a choice.
[01:28:33.480 --> 01:28:37.080]   We always the food and entertainment at the Google law do.
[01:28:37.080 --> 01:28:39.400]   Oh, the food was fantastic. The entertainment was great.
[01:28:39.400 --> 01:28:42.920]   I was impressed at the number of people, big names that they were able to get out
[01:28:42.920 --> 01:28:46.920]   to that event. Because I'm sure that that's the last thing anybody wants to do on a Monday night
[01:28:46.920 --> 01:28:53.320]   is stick around and meet media folk. But they got everybody was there and it was really fun.
[01:28:53.320 --> 01:28:55.800]   And I really had a great time and got some real insights into what they're doing.
[01:28:55.800 --> 01:28:58.840]   And I think we're going to get a number of people in to do.
[01:28:58.840 --> 01:29:03.320]   I want to do have a kind of like a who will come on and do a five minute tip on every show
[01:29:03.320 --> 01:29:07.320]   where they just say, you know, hey, here's the three things you might not have known about Google
[01:29:07.320 --> 01:29:10.840]   news. That kind of thing. And they've been trying to get that going.
[01:29:10.840 --> 01:29:13.160]   Yeah, I think we're going to get it going. There was a lot of fun.
[01:29:13.160 --> 01:29:16.200]   And you know, I came away with this phone. I don't know. It's very nice.
[01:29:16.200 --> 01:29:19.320]   They want it back though. I'm going to.
[01:29:19.320 --> 01:29:23.640]   No, it's a long one. But I'm going to buy one now that I've tried it. It's it's fantastic.
[01:29:23.640 --> 01:29:27.720]   All right. Hey, thank you everybody. Joel Johnson. Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:29:27.720 --> 01:29:31.960]   Joel is it Gizmodo. Thanks for having me. Really nice to see you again.
[01:29:31.960 --> 01:29:34.120]   Can I can I slide in a quick plug? Yeah.
[01:29:34.120 --> 01:29:40.520]   Next week, we haven't told anybody this yet. So you guys are the first to know. But on Tuesday,
[01:29:40.520 --> 01:29:46.120]   I'm heading to Afghanistan to be embedded with some Marines for a few weeks or like a couple
[01:29:46.120 --> 01:29:51.400]   weeks. So yeah, we'll be updating basically Gizmodo from Afghanistan, which will be interesting.
[01:29:51.400 --> 01:29:57.000]   Is there a gadget angle? I'm going to be reviewing a lot of gear that I use personally.
[01:29:57.000 --> 01:30:02.120]   But the story is actually more about some photojournalists that are out there doing a really cool tech
[01:30:02.120 --> 01:30:06.520]   project at base track dot org. So but yeah, there's a lot of different parts of it. It's a big story.
[01:30:06.520 --> 01:30:10.200]   I did see a story that the I can't remember if it was all of the military, just the army was
[01:30:10.200 --> 01:30:14.520]   going to suggesting iPhones or Android phones for its troops. Yeah, they haven't locked that down
[01:30:14.520 --> 01:30:18.760]   yet. But there is an interesting way. Yeah. Well, that sounds like we'll watch that.
[01:30:18.760 --> 01:30:20.760]   Gizmodo.com or is your special site for that?
[01:30:20.760 --> 01:30:23.960]   No, it'll be good. Yeah, please be useful. Godspeed, man.
[01:30:23.960 --> 01:30:29.400]   Are you good? Good. Good. Good. Good. I was nervous and I'm kind of over it now. It's like,
[01:30:29.400 --> 01:30:33.720]   you know, what do you do? Like, and it's not like I'm going to be putting myself in harm's way.
[01:30:33.720 --> 01:30:38.360]   So harm harm finds its way to you sometimes in places like. Yeah. Well, good luck.
[01:30:38.920 --> 01:30:45.000]   All right. Thanks. That sounds amazing. Yeah. Gina Trapani is at smarter where.org and think up,
