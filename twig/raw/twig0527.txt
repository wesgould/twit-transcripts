[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   This week in Google.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   And we're going to Google today, but not with Stacey, because she's at the Amazon event,
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   trying the twerking bears and stuff.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   But we'll get her a report next week.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   Aunt Pruitt is here from Twig.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   I love saying that.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   And soon to be new shows about to be announced any minute now.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   Any minute now, we're getting real.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   You could announce them on this show.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   No, we want it.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   No, we want it.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   No, we want it.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   It's top secret.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   We don't want anybody to steal.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   Aunt or the idea.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   That's Jeff Jarvis.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   He's back home.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   And, Jacey, hello, Jeff.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   Jeff, as we all know, is the Leonard Taoh Professor of journalistic innovation at the Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   at the City University of New York, Blogger@BuzzMachine.com.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   He's at Jack Jarvis.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   And in Stacey's place, she sent a surrogate, Kevin Tovel.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   Hey!
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   Where's Norman?
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   He's on my Google Photos right now, on my Google Nest Hub.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   He's downstairs.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   Okay, so we're going to talk about that in a second.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   Aboutcrombooks.com, great fella.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   And also Stacey's co-host on the IOT show.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   We talked last week, your ears might have been burning about your norm folder on this public
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   on Google Photos.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   Yes, yes.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   He has so many people that love looking at his photos on Instagram that I started a Google Photos album for Norm.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   It's public.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   And people seem to like it.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   They're subscribing.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   They're putting on their own Google Nest Hubs, I guess.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   I don't know.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   Whatever.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   It's really cool.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   Are you going to get Norm an Amazon dog collar?
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   No.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   He actually doesn't wear a collar at all.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   He didn't even care for those.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   I feel for Stacey's dog, Stacey's dog is sure to be the first dog with an Amazon IOT dog collar.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   Yeah, GPS tracker and...
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Oh, yeah, that dog.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   That dog is enjoying the IOT world.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   It's lost all its privacy.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   So, Kevin, when people say, "Oh, you're doing Norm, how do I get Norm?
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   How do I do Norm?"
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.520]   Oh, there's a link.
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:44.520]   You've got it there.
[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.000]   Maybe we can put it in the show notes or something, but you can...
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   It's a long-ass link.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   You want me to give that out?
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   Well, I didn't make it.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   How do we...
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   There's got to be...
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   I don't know.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   There seems like...
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   There's a share link there.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   Maybe that can be short.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   But we don't have Google Plus.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   I know.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   Wouldn't it be easier?
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   Wouldn't it be nice?
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   Create link.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   Yeah, well...
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   Yeah, it's kind of a long link.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   Photos.app.boo.go.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   I will ask Norm to shorten his link.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   I'm showing you a link, Norm.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   I'm showing you a link.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   Actually, can people add photos to this or is it a Norm only?
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   I believe I set it up that they can only view and leave comments.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   I don't think they can add.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   This is new to me, this activity bar.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.800]   I think this is something photos added recently, where you can see people's comments.
[00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.800]   This really does become, in a way, your very own Google Plus.
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:37.800]   Does that?
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:38.800]   Right.
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.920]   Yeah, I respond to people.
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:43.800]   We have a good time bantering about Norm and his silly photos.
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.800]   You can see in the top row of photos there, we are working on a mattress sponsorship.
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.800]   Is this a Casper Norm?
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.800]   A Casper Norm?
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:53.800]   Oh, he's not picky.
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:54.800]   He'll sleep on anything.
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:57.800]   But if he's going to get paid, that's fine.
[00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:58.800]   Norm is a Casper.
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:59.800]   True.
[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:00.800]   Such a ham.
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:01.800]   He is.
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.800]   He's asleep in most of the time.
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.800]   Others is bloody Gus.
[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:06.800]   I had to babysit Gus.
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:08.800]   People thought it was another Norm.
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:09.800]   Gus and Norm.
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:10.800]   Yep.
[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:11.800]   That's so cute.
[00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.560]   I don't know if you got the idea from, but we've mentioned Mike Elgin's nice book.
[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:22.640]   This was Mike's response to the loss of Google Plus and the pit of despair that has become
[00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:23.640]   Facebook.
[00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:29.000]   He does exactly the same thing, where he shares pictures from his life.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.280]   It's his kind of Facebook feed.
[00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.280]   I guess we should probably do a twit.
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:34.280]   Saying, huh?
[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:35.280]   We have lots of pictures.
[00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:36.760]   We got a bunch of photographers now.
[00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:39.160]   Between that and Instagram, we'll have it covered.
[00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:41.040]   See, I don't want to support Instagram.
[00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.040]   I really don't.
[00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.040]   I created Instagram.
[00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.040]   Oh, sorry.
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.040]   Hey.
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:46.040]   Hey, Instagram.
[00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:50.280]   Hey, because every ninth picture I buy something, which I really don't like.
[00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:51.280]   We'll see.
[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:52.920]   That's not Instagram's fault.
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.400]   No, it's my exact name.
[00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.000]   No, in fact, in a way, they've done too good a job.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.240]   But I do have to say that if so, I have an Instagram account, but it's private.
[00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:02.240]   Nobody can follow me.
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:06.680]   I only follow one person, my wife, because she posts pictures on Instagram that apparently
[00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:07.680]   I should see.
[00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:08.680]   Yeah.
[00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:11.440]   She's so silly.
[00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:16.000]   But I do notice if you only follow one person on Instagram, you don't get ads.
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   What?
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.840]   Like, I don't know why, but there's not maybe there's not enough pictures or something too
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:20.840]   late.
[00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:29.000]   You are a anti-social, paranoid, schizophrenic, insane, uh, loader, and you're not worth advertising
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   to.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   Okay.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   Absolutely right.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   Sounds like.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   That's why.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.680]   So why don't you guys just do a shared Google photo album?
[00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:37.680]   There's no ads ever there.
[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.120]   I mean, you know, that's what I'm saying.
[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:40.120]   That's the whole idea, right?
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:41.560]   Is do this instead of Instagram.
[00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:43.200]   Yeah, I'm going to do that.
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:44.640]   And we maybe make a twit one.
[00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:47.440]   And if we do, we'll let you know and that could go with our other.
[00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:51.680]   We're trying another thing and I'll talk more about that in the weeks to come, which is
[00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:54.800]   a forum site that we're going to start working on instead of.
[00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:55.800]   That's going to be fun.
[00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:56.800]   People could participate.
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:57.800]   Well, you know what happened?
[00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:03.960]   I got a great email from a guy who said, um, the problem with the chat, which of course
[00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:07.080]   is our primary community interface because it's live.
[00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:08.600]   So it's interactive while we're live.
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:09.600]   You have to watch live.
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:10.600]   Right.
[00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:14.240]   And if you don't watch live, the chat is meaningless because it's scrolled off.
[00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:15.240]   There's no history.
[00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:16.240]   Quickly.
[00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:21.360]   So, uh, and it's so it kind of tends to a small group of people who are there every day, but
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.240]   it isn't a way that everybody could participate.
[00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.560]   So I think we, I think he made a very good point.
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:28.360]   I think we need a way that everybody can participate in our shows.
[00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:32.240]   So we've had forums before, but there are a lot of work and I just, there are a lot of
[00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:33.240]   work.
[00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:34.240]   I got lazy again.
[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:36.280]   The chat room, no disrespect.
[00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:38.800]   It is really, really niche down.
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:41.840]   You go out in the wild and say, I R C to people.
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:42.840]   Right?
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:43.840]   What?
[00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:46.200]   Yeah, you know, but I, but I think anybody who watches our show should be.
[00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:47.200]   People to get to it.
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:48.200]   Right.
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:50.040]   I wonder if it's, we're sitting a bar.
[00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:51.040]   Right.
[00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:56.640]   I wonder if you guys could use that new feature that lets you just get snippets of YouTube
[00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:01.540]   videos, certain sections and make each one of those like in the forum and now people
[00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:03.000]   can respond to that.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   Great idea.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   See, this is why I think a forum is an opportunity to do some really interesting stuff.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   Great.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   I like forums.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   I like forums.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   I, I, that's, we set them up.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.040]   That was one of the first things I did when I set up the local news sites that worked
[00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:16.040]   on forums.
[00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:17.040]   It seems so 90s.
[00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:18.040]   That's all it does.
[00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:19.040]   It's the only thing Kevin said that.
[00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:22.000]   Hey, but it's the good old days, the 90s.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.040]   But there's something to be said for it.
[00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:28.960]   And I actually it may, I think they may come back again as people tire of Facebook and
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:33.240]   Twitter and Instagram, these big TikTok, these global phenomenon.
[00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:36.920]   Maybe they want something that is more about the community they're a part of.
[00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:42.720]   You know, why shouldn't a city have its own forum or podcast network or software.
[00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:47.280]   In hyper local, someone like in, I think, what is it?
[00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:52.240]   South Orange Maplewood, I think Maplewood, the, the hyper local site is still a forum.
[00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:53.240]   Yes.
[00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:54.240]   See, I think that's interesting.
[00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:55.760]   Patch still is around.
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:56.760]   Petaloma.
[00:08:56.760 --> 00:09:03.080]   Well, but we have a Petaloma patch and it's active and people write articles for it and
[00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:04.080]   post to it.
[00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:06.600]   I don't, what, who was patch?
[00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:07.600]   What happened to them?
[00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:12.240]   Patch was the former president of AOL.
[00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:13.240]   What?
[00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:14.240]   Help me.
[00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:15.240]   Help me.
[00:09:15.240 --> 00:09:16.240]   Help me.
[00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:17.240]   Help me.
[00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:18.240]   It's not Steve Case.
[00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:19.240]   It's a patch.
[00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:23.640]   No, former former former head of revenue at Google who then went to, oh hell.
[00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:26.480]   Oh, this is embarrassing.
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:28.320]   Former head of AOL.
[00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:29.320]   It's in.
[00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:30.320]   He sold.
[00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:31.320]   He sold the company to Verizon.
[00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:32.320]   It's owned by Hale Global now.
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:34.120]   Well, that was so, so he.
[00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:35.120]   John.
[00:09:35.120 --> 00:09:36.120]   Chat room.
[00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:37.120]   Help me.
[00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:38.120]   I remember.
[00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:39.120]   Warren.
[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.120]   No, no, no, no.
[00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:41.120]   That's the person towards the patch.
[00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:42.120]   It's a bigger guy.
[00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:43.120]   You know who I'm talking about.
[00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:44.120]   He sold AOL to Verizon.
[00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:45.120]   Warren Webster.
[00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:46.120]   No, no.
[00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:47.120]   I have.
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:49.120]   I'm going to keep throwing Warren's at you.
[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:51.120]   Oh, this is killing me.
[00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:52.120]   Tim Armstrong.
[00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:53.120]   Thank you.
[00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:54.120]   Tim Armstrong.
[00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:55.120]   Tim Armstrong.
[00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:56.120]   Yes.
[00:09:56.120 --> 00:10:02.000]   So Tim Armstrong, before he, when it was taking over AOL, he started Pat.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   No, I'm sorry.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   Before you did it well.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.400]   Just as a passion.
[00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:06.400]   He'd left Google.
[00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:08.200]   Head of revenue there.
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:13.520]   Wikipedia says there wasn't enough information about his hometown of Riverside, Connecticut.
[00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:14.520]   Exactly.
[00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:15.520]   So he did it.
[00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:24.080]   He tried to bring me into advise, but I was not appreciative of their plan to not cooperate
[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:27.160]   with local bloggers that existed instead to kill them.
[00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:29.280]   So I said that wasn't very nice.
[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:32.840]   And I feared that they were going to, they had a whole formula for what towns to go into
[00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:36.240]   and I feared it was going to redline, you know, local journalism around rich towns that
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:37.240]   had downtowns.
[00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:43.000]   Well, what's interesting is our local paper, the Petaloma Argus' Career, is in some way
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.560]   affiliated with Patch.
[00:10:44.560 --> 00:10:46.560]   So they've made, made nice.
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:47.560]   Yeah.
[00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:51.320]   So, so, so what he went, so they started the model.
[00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:53.120]   They thought they knew everything.
[00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:55.240]   They didn't really get the model down.
[00:10:55.240 --> 00:10:59.440]   They, you know, like advertisers were being charged a very high rate for very low return.
[00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:02.560]   It wasn't working as well as they thought, but then they went ahead and multiplied at
[00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:03.560]   times 900.
[00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:06.960]   So they were 900 towns across the country.
[00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:09.640]   And now it was too hard to fix the problems they had.
[00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:11.200]   They didn't get the model down.
[00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:12.680]   And so really didn't work all that well.
[00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:19.720]   So then AOL, he, he, when he took over AOL, he incorporated it into AOL, but it was controversial
[00:11:19.720 --> 00:11:20.720]   there.
[00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:21.720]   Didn't work very well.
[00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:22.800]   Feeling wasn't was a conflict.
[00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:25.400]   And so then he sold it off.
[00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:27.760]   And that's how it ended up with the current owner and the current owner.
[00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:28.760]   Yeah, it still exists.
[00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:30.760]   And I still find out things from it.
[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:33.320]   But it's a much cheaper operation, shall we say?
[00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:34.360]   Look at ours.
[00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:35.840]   This is Petaluma's patch.
[00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:38.080]   I've never heard of this in them.
[00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:43.360]   70,000 visits in the last 30 days as probably more than the Argus Courier's circulation.
[00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:51.080]   There are lots of stories here by people who don't honestly probably get paid, but people
[00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:52.080]   are doing it.
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:53.200]   There's calendars of events.
[00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:56.040]   I don't know who's putting the energy into this, but it's really great.
[00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:57.040]   They have some staff.
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:11:58.040]   They have some staff.
[00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:01.280]   They have a lot of staff that Duke, we write and stuff like that.
[00:12:01.280 --> 00:12:06.360]   If you want to find a local model that's really working, there's a company called Village Media,
[00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:11.200]   a headquarter in Soussaint Marie in Canada.
[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:16.920]   And they have, they've really succeeded in going into towns like that.
[00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:20.480]   70,000 people thereabouts and have local news.
[00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:22.720]   A guy named Jeff LG runs it.
[00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:24.760]   Google loves them.
[00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:30.320]   And so that's going to be the basis software for Google-funded Night Ritter to start three
[00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:31.320]   local experiments.
[00:12:31.320 --> 00:12:32.320]   I only read this idea.
[00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:35.120]   I feel like this is like reading a little bit.
[00:12:35.120 --> 00:12:39.280]   It's like reading grit a little bit.
[00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:44.960]   In fact, if you go to patch.com, which is the over global site, and you can enter in
[00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:50.560]   your zip code or your town, but you can also read today's top local news from Swamp Scott,
[00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:55.280]   Massachusetts comes this one, Amazon driver fired after trashing dozens of undelivered
[00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:57.640]   packages from Des Moines, Iowa.
[00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:03.880]   Iowans beer fundraiser for six kids goes flat over old tweets from Miami, Florida.
[00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:09.880]   Hey, Echo, I need a job and a big Mac from Tribeca, Fye, Dye, New York.
[00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:11.640]   See the big city getting involved.
[00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:14.120]   Metz stolen coffin is going back to Egypt.
[00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:16.920]   I just feel like across America.
[00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:17.920]   This is good.
[00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:18.920]   This is great.
[00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:23.520]   This is much more interesting than what we're reading about in our national papers.
[00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:26.880]   And here's mine in Bridgewater, New Jersey.
[00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:30.640]   Dog, comic cat stuck on roof rescued by Bonbrook police.
[00:13:30.640 --> 00:13:32.920]   That's what you want to read.
[00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:33.920]   You know what?
[00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:37.120]   It looks like it looks like Norm.
[00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:38.720]   But what's he doing with a cat on the roof?
[00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:39.720]   Are they stepping out?
[00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:40.720]   What's going on?
[00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:41.720]   I don't know.
[00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:42.720]   I'm going to get out.
[00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:43.720]   I'm going to get out.
[00:13:43.720 --> 00:13:48.880]   I have one problem with patch as I just checked on the zip code back up.
[00:13:48.880 --> 00:13:49.880]   In my hometown.
[00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:51.480]   Oh, there's no green sports.
[00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:52.480]   That's the problem.
[00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:54.040]   And then I clicked on sports.
[00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:56.440]   There's no green blank page, really.
[00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:59.240]   Home of the Clemson Tigers.
[00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:00.240]   Really?
[00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:01.240]   There's no Clemson Tigers.
[00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:03.600]   Number one team in all the land.
[00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:04.600]   There's...
[00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:05.600]   Okay, patch.
[00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:06.600]   All right, patch.
[00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:07.600]   Let's talk.
[00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:08.600]   Yeah.
[00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:09.600]   Hey, well, I got this.
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:10.600]   They need a curse.
[00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:13.000]   They have it at Facebook or Amazon today.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.640]   And so we can just talk about low.
[00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:15.640]   Oh, shut up.
[00:14:15.640 --> 00:14:16.640]   All right.
[00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:17.640]   All right.
[00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:18.640]   The producer weighs in.
[00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:23.360]   Amazon announced like 8,000 products, including...
[00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:24.360]   I'm not kidding you.
[00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:26.760]   A twerking bear.
[00:14:26.760 --> 00:14:27.920]   Did you see this?
[00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:29.920]   I miss the twerking bear.
[00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:33.480]   Technically, the twerking bear was not announced, but it was there.
[00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:36.000]   Jimmy, the twerking bear.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.560]   It's $10.30.
[00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:44.560]   It says on the back of Jimmy, the twerking bear, that's my jam.
[00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:46.200]   Here's a video of Jimmy.
[00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:48.560]   Once you've received your twerking Santa, twerking bear, you're going to get a little
[00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:51.480]   twerking Christmas bear or twerking everyday bear.
[00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:53.320]   It's time to choose your power source.
[00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:54.320]   You can have it.
[00:14:54.320 --> 00:14:55.320]   Oh, geez.
[00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:56.480]   That's why I can't twerk.
[00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:58.040]   I haven't chosen a power source.
[00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:00.720]   So you're going to stick the USB up its rear end?
[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:01.720]   That's why I'm looking.
[00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:02.720]   I want to see the twerk.
[00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:03.720]   I mean, here comes...
[00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:04.720]   Oh, my goodness.
[00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:05.720]   Oh, no.
[00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:06.720]   Oh, no.
[00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:07.720]   Alexa, wake me up.
[00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:08.720]   Oh, so I get it.
[00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:09.720]   Oh, so you can set it to twerk when you're...
[00:15:09.720 --> 00:15:10.720]   I'm set for 3PM.
[00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:17.360]   Oh, it's like the big mouth bigly best.
[00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:19.160]   It's Amazon Echo's voice.
[00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:22.280]   And when the alarm goes off the butt...
[00:15:22.280 --> 00:15:23.280]   It's...
[00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:26.000]   Remind me tomorrow at noon to call Mom.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:29.200]   I can't help but the laugh at this.
[00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:30.200]   The lipsticks pretty good.
[00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:32.280]   It's better than it was for DevNol.
[00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:33.280]   Yeah.
[00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:40.400]   Um, they also announced that you'll be able to get voices for your Amazon Echo, including
[00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:42.360]   Samuel L. Jackson.
[00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:43.360]   Please.
[00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:44.360]   Please.
[00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:45.360]   Please.
[00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:46.360]   Please.
[00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:48.360]   It may be explicit.
[00:15:48.360 --> 00:15:49.360]   Oh, MFs.
[00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:50.360]   Wow.
[00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:51.360]   Wow.
[00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:52.360]   Wow.
[00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:53.360]   That's been there.
[00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:54.360]   Can't wait.
[00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:55.360]   Oh, MFs.
[00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:56.360]   99 cents.
[00:15:56.360 --> 00:16:00.080]   They didn't say whether it was one time only and that's temporary fee.
[00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:02.080]   But did they...
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:03.080]   Kevin, were you able to...
[00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:04.280]   Because this is really up your alley.
[00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:05.960]   I know Stacy's at the event.
[00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:09.320]   Were you able to somehow find out what was going on there?
[00:16:09.320 --> 00:16:13.160]   Honestly, I was in class all afternoon and got back here just in time.
[00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:14.160]   However, for the show...
[00:16:14.160 --> 00:16:16.160]   For buried in Python.
[00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:17.160]   No, no, I moved on.
[00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:19.480]   We'll talk about that later if there's time.
[00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:24.440]   But no, Stacy actually had me right before the show edit her post that covers everything.
[00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:27.080]   So that's how I'm figuring out what's what.
[00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:32.680]   So like the rumor was 25 new Echo products.
[00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:33.680]   Yeah, 15.
[00:16:33.680 --> 00:16:36.040]   A high end, there were only 15.
[00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:37.880]   Oh, a high end Echo studio.
[00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:39.240]   12 Lizzy Amazon.
[00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:44.680]   The new Echo Show 8, which I presume is not the eighth edition, but eight inches.
[00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:45.680]   Eight inches, yes.
[00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:48.120]   Echo Dot with a clock.
[00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:51.200]   The three in one Amazon smart oven.
[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:52.200]   No, let's go.
[00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:53.200]   Let's go.
[00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:54.840]   I'll make sure we cover that.
[00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:56.200]   I wish Stacy were here for that one.
[00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:57.200]   Yeah.
[00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:58.200]   Echo Bud's earphones.
[00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:02.520]   Echo frames I wear with an Amazon's Echo built in.
[00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:04.000]   By invitation only.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.360]   It's like day one thing for experimental products.
[00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:11.760]   Too bad the twerking bears not experiment.
[00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:16.360]   A ring, not a ring doorbell, which Amazon does own, but an actual jewelry ring for your
[00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:17.360]   finger.
[00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:20.600]   Oh, what does that do?
[00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:22.160]   I guess it has Echo in your ring.
[00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:23.160]   Hopefully it does.
[00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:24.160]   And hopefully it does.
[00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:25.560]   It works well because it's $129.
[00:17:25.560 --> 00:17:27.520]   Another invite only deal.
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:29.160]   Yeah.
[00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:30.840]   This is really, really kind of amazing.
[00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:33.520]   If I go to Stacy and IOT, is her post up?
[00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:34.520]   Did you finish everything?
[00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:35.520]   It is indeed.
[00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:36.520]   Yep.
[00:17:36.520 --> 00:17:37.520]   All right.
[00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:38.520]   Well, let's go.
[00:17:38.520 --> 00:17:40.400]   I'd rather see that than somebody else's coverage.
[00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:43.600]   Everything we care about from the Echo event.
[00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:46.880]   She's allowed to write the A word, but I can't say the A word.
[00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:47.880]   No, I can't say it.
[00:17:47.880 --> 00:17:48.880]   Can't say it.
[00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:49.880]   A word.
[00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:54.040]   Why did you do that?
[00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:55.600]   Looks like a nice event in Seattle.
[00:17:55.600 --> 00:17:57.800]   I'm sure Stacy was happy to be there.
[00:17:57.800 --> 00:17:59.920]   Oh, hi, Stacy.
[00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:04.200]   Amazon's David Limp.
[00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:05.400]   Who's David Limp?
[00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:08.560]   That's the name I'm familiar with.
[00:18:08.560 --> 00:18:09.560]   I don't know.
[00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:14.040]   I don't know if the event, focusing on privacy, they spent 10 minutes talking about how they
[00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:16.960]   have handled privacy in the past.
[00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:19.760]   They do have a physical circuit that turns the microphone on and off.
[00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:22.640]   I use that all the time.
[00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:25.000]   The privacy zones on the Ring doorbell.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   Okay.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:29.040]   That's something the hello does not have.
[00:18:29.040 --> 00:18:33.600]   And Echo shows will now have a physical camera shutter, which I think is a really good idea.
[00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:37.640]   They also, in response to criticism, I might add, said they're going to make it easier for
[00:18:37.640 --> 00:18:38.920]   people to delete recordings.
[00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:43.440]   You could say Echo delete everything I said today or everything I just said.
[00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:48.120]   There will be a new home mode for camera based devices and security devices.
[00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:51.480]   That means they won't record until you leave the house.
[00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:54.040]   That's something Nest has had for some time.
[00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:55.040]   Right.
[00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:56.040]   The problem.
[00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:57.040]   They know you love the house.
[00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:58.040]   Your phone.
[00:18:58.040 --> 00:18:59.960]   The Amazon app on your phone.
[00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:03.040]   You can designate a device, whatever you want.
[00:19:03.040 --> 00:19:07.560]   But then the Amazon always knows where you are, but that's another thing.
[00:19:07.560 --> 00:19:08.560]   Yeah.
[00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:11.160]   And actually I want the cameras on it late at night when I'm home.
[00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:15.720]   So yeah, I'm not sure I want to have it, you know, but that makes sense.
[00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:16.880]   It's a privacy mode.
[00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:21.520]   And truthfully, the one reason we don't have cameras in the house is because Lisa said,
[00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:23.640]   no, that's not going to happen.
[00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:24.640]   All right.
[00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:27.280]   And she's right because she walks around naked all the time.
[00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:30.160]   So which doesn't bother me.
[00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:32.440]   I wonder why.
[00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:33.640]   No, I'm just joking.
[00:19:33.640 --> 00:19:37.800]   But it is the case of I think people maybe sensitive to cameras in the house.
[00:19:37.800 --> 00:19:40.080]   We did get that new and I take it.
[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:44.920]   You have it because you were just mentioning it, Kevin, the new Nest Home Max, next desktop
[00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:45.920]   Max.
[00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:47.640]   I really like that device.
[00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:49.200]   So I did not get one yet.
[00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:51.480]   I think Stacy has one on order.
[00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:54.480]   So we're kind of living vicariously through other people.
[00:19:54.480 --> 00:19:58.160]   She's really interested in the personalization as you walk past.
[00:19:58.160 --> 00:19:59.160]   It's weird.
[00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:00.160]   You walk up to it.
[00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:01.160]   You have to turn this on.
[00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:02.160]   It's on by off by default.
[00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:03.160]   I still do.
[00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:04.760]   And it makes a little boop.
[00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:07.880]   And it says, hi Leo, because it knows me.
[00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:10.560]   It shows my calendar, shows stuff I'd be interested in.
[00:20:10.560 --> 00:20:14.360]   It does a whole slideshow of things for me.
[00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:19.680]   And it's still just like the little baby, the best picture frame ever because if you
[00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:22.840]   use Google Photos, it's totally awesome for that.
[00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:23.840]   I like that idea.
[00:20:23.840 --> 00:20:27.000]   But where are they storing this data that shows your biometrics?
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.840]   Where is that being kept?
[00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:29.840]   I don't know.
[00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:31.560]   Because with Apple, it's on device only, right?
[00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:33.320]   So I don't know what Amazon is.
[00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:36.280]   Yeah, I mean, it's not that different than the voice match feature, right?
[00:20:36.280 --> 00:20:37.960]   I mean, it recognizes your voices.
[00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:40.480]   So you can say what's on my calendar and it will show your calendar.
[00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:41.480]   That's a good thing.
[00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:42.480]   We want that, right?
[00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:43.480]   Yeah.
[00:20:43.480 --> 00:20:44.480]   Well, some people do.
[00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:45.480]   Some people don't.
[00:20:45.480 --> 00:20:46.480]   I do.
[00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:47.480]   I like that convenience.
[00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:51.520]   But again, I have to ask because that's the world we live in today as well.
[00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:54.800]   Well, privacy concerns and who has a very good point.
[00:20:54.800 --> 00:21:01.200]   It's also the case that we have seen more and more devices asking for face recognition.
[00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:04.040]   For instance, my hello doorbell.
[00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:05.760]   And again, you have to turn it on.
[00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:08.440]   This is the Google Nest doorbell.
[00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:10.560]   Does face recognition for everybody who comes to the door?
[00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:15.400]   Now, that's really great because it will notify Michael just got home because it knows
[00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:20.440]   what he looks like or somebody I don't know just left a package on your porch.
[00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:25.320]   I think that's useful, but they also point out comply with local laws because we're
[00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:26.600]   still caveats with that.
[00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:30.480]   Yeah, we're recording people's faces and clearly sending it to the cloud.
[00:21:30.480 --> 00:21:35.600]   Well, keep in mind that I/O, the Google said it's going to take its machine learning models
[00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:38.800]   and push them down to the devices at the edge itself.
[00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:42.320]   So at some point, if not already, that data's not going to go anywhere.
[00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:44.000]   We're going to need to demand that, aren't we?
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.440]   We're going to need to say we want that.
[00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:49.920]   And if it can do it, clearly it has to be able to do it.
[00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:54.400]   The Echo Glow, which is going to really annoy Casper, the mattress manufacturer, because
[00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:59.400]   they have also a glowing lamp called the Glow.
[00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:02.960]   The difference about the Echo Glow is it has Amazon Echo built in.
[00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:10.240]   And it's for kids, which is kind of a surprise given Amazon's lawsuit about listening to
[00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:13.560]   children and targeting them with ads.
[00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:20.040]   SDK for the Echo Glow will tie into programs used by schools to manage homework.
[00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:21.520]   Are you going to bed, Billy?
[00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:28.520]   Don't you think you should finish your history homework?
[00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:32.400]   Students will be able to whitelist users who can call their kids on Echo devices.
[00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:37.600]   Well, I should hope so.
[00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:38.920]   Holy cow.
[00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:43.640]   And apparently there's an Amazon free time service, which will be available on the new
[00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:50.400]   Echo Show, which, and then if you tie in the kids' school, you'll actually be able to
[00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:55.040]   say, "Hey, Echo, how did Ant do on his math test last yesterday?"
[00:22:55.040 --> 00:22:56.040]   What?
[00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:58.720]   It's going to require the schools want to do that.
[00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:02.080]   I don't know how many are going to jump on that bandwagon right away.
[00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:04.960]   Well, parents want it.
[00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:09.200]   Yeah, my kids' schools are all tied into power school.
[00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:16.840]   I know pretty much every paper in my children, every grade on every test they take.
[00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:18.480]   Yeah, isn't that amazing?
[00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:19.480]   Just kind of weird.
[00:23:19.480 --> 00:23:22.680]   Now, when they get to an age, I think you know, Zach and Alex are a little young, but when
[00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:28.440]   I think when they get to 13 or at some point, then the weird thing happens, this happened
[00:23:28.440 --> 00:23:31.520]   with my kids, then they say, "No, you can't know what they did, how they did."
[00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:32.920]   Right, it is 13.
[00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:33.920]   Yes.
[00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:34.920]   That's so weird.
[00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:35.920]   It is 13.
[00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:36.920]   Yeah, it is.
[00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:38.600]   You can't know how they did.
[00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:42.000]   Their grades are not your, that you have to get their permission, you have to get them.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.480]   So that's happening with your kids.
[00:23:43.480 --> 00:23:47.960]   I guess I must admit, I know my 15 year olds and my 13 year olds.
[00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:49.760]   You can still know their grades?
[00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:50.760]   I don't.
[00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:57.200]   It happened to me in North Carolina before we came here when I were now 16 year old, turned
[00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:58.200]   13, turned 13.
[00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:03.640]   And I remember having to go and have him sign off on stuff.
[00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:04.640]   Isn't that weird?
[00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:05.640]   I'm like, "Dude, this is..."
[00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:06.640]   It pissed me off.
[00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:07.640]   I'm paying my college.
[00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:09.640]   I want to know how my kids are doing.
[00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:11.760]   Are they kicking those classes I'm paying for?
[00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:17.400]   And then with my oldest boy, the 21 year old, this is before he went into the US Army.
[00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:22.920]   He went to college and I had no access to any of his information.
[00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:25.360]   But I was following that because I was like, "I'm not paying for it."
[00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:26.360]   He's a grown up.
[00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:28.640]   Yeah, I was and still I didn't know.
[00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:33.040]   Here's the echo dot clock.
[00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:37.240]   By the way, now that Amazon owns Ring and Eero, there are apparently some new Ring and
[00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:38.320]   Eero stuff as well.
[00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:39.320]   But that's the clock.
[00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:40.320]   I think that's a good idea.
[00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:47.000]   That's a nice little digital clock on the side, on the fabric side of the echo.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:51.640]   There's an echo flex which plugs into the wall.
[00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:57.080]   Stacy says it's a device the size of an air freshener, has a USB socket on the bottom.
[00:24:57.080 --> 00:25:00.600]   $25, you could put the echo in every room.
[00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:03.120]   This is, yeah, that's the thing.
[00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:07.400]   Whoever's voice dominates your house, right?
[00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:09.240]   And you've got to have a device in every single room.
[00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:10.800]   It's like the old intercom.
[00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:11.800]   Yeah.
[00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:13.800]   And will Amazon do it?
[00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:18.800]   Well, I'm old enough to remember when houses had intercoms.
[00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:19.800]   Me too.
[00:25:19.800 --> 00:25:20.800]   I had to.
[00:25:20.800 --> 00:25:23.880]   So our 16-year-old goes into my office to turn off the lights.
[00:25:23.880 --> 00:25:26.760]   He said, "No, no, no, no.
[00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:28.440]   Don't touch that switch."
[00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:32.080]   I say echo, turn off lights.
[00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:33.600]   And he was like, "Non plus."
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:35.680]   The whole thing was, "What are you talking about?"
[00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:38.080]   He was like, "He's been going, I couldn't figure out."
[00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:39.080]   I finally caught him.
[00:25:39.080 --> 00:25:41.480]   Somebody's been going to turn off all the lights on my office.
[00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:43.560]   And I couldn't figure out.
[00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:44.560]   Because then nothing works.
[00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:46.800]   Because I have a sensor, a motion sensor in there.
[00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:47.800]   That's interesting.
[00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:49.760]   You get to the point where there'll be no light switches.
[00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:51.160]   Well, that's the thing.
[00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:54.200]   We're in this intermediate state where there are both light switches and voice.
[00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:55.200]   Yeah.
[00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:56.200]   Right.
[00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:57.200]   I had a lot of that.
[00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:58.200]   No, don't touch it.
[00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:01.280]   I should put a big sign.
[00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:03.480]   I can't bring myself to do that.
[00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:04.880]   So that's the echo flex.
[00:26:04.880 --> 00:26:07.080]   I think that's really interesting.
[00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:14.360]   Kudos Amazon for continuing to make the barrier of entry so easy with that 25-0 price point.
[00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:17.800]   And this is just going on for the last couple of years.
[00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:24.400]   Now, Kevin, I don't know if you're editing the job or if this, I don't have to try and
[00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:26.480]   understand this sentence.
[00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:31.560]   It also opens up an accessory market for the echo and with limp showing off a motion
[00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:36.840]   detector and a nightlight available for $15 each is with limp a company.
[00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:38.840]   So I lose actually in a rush.
[00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:39.840]   The guy.
[00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:41.400]   Oh, and with limp.
[00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:42.880]   Oh, that's the guy.
[00:26:42.880 --> 00:26:43.880]   Yeah.
[00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:47.920]   So with limp showing off that, yeah, these are comparable for the.
[00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:52.440]   What is the what is the 1499 product then?
[00:26:52.440 --> 00:26:53.440]   Is it the echo?
[00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:54.440]   Motion sensor.
[00:26:54.440 --> 00:26:55.440]   Oh, no.
[00:26:55.440 --> 00:26:56.440]   That's the guy's name.
[00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:57.440]   I know.
[00:26:57.440 --> 00:26:58.440]   I'm getting.
[00:26:58.440 --> 00:27:00.720]   I'm getting a motion detection sensor and nightlight.
[00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:03.520]   OK, but no echo built into that, I guess.
[00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:04.520]   Right.
[00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:08.760]   It just probably ties in so that way you could say if somebody walks into the room, the
[00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:10.240]   motion is detected, maybe turn away.
[00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:11.240]   Oh, yeah.
[00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:16.120]   And I do have a motion detector for my hue lights that do that, which is really great.
[00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:17.840]   The echo studio.
[00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:21.600]   So this is, she says, the answer to Sonos and the Google Max speaker.
[00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:24.040]   I love the Google Max.
[00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:26.480]   That thing is so great.
[00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:30.080]   It has Google Assistant, but it's a big enough speaker that the sound is very good.
[00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:32.040]   I remember it being pretty robust.
[00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:33.040]   It's a heavy.
[00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:34.040]   It's heavy.
[00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:37.960]   Well, any good speaker is going to be a little heavy because of the transformer.
[00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:40.880]   She says the studio is the size of an ice bucket.
[00:27:40.880 --> 00:27:41.880]   Good old Stacy.
[00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:49.040]   Oh, it's roughly the size of a cocktail shaker and two cocktail glasses.
[00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:53.440]   But it has three mid-range speakers positioned on the top two size, one pointing up to the
[00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:55.960]   top of the room, a tweeter and a base at the bottom.
[00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:56.960]   This sounds a lot like that.
[00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:57.960]   It's beautiful.
[00:27:57.960 --> 00:27:58.960]   It's beautiful.
[00:27:58.960 --> 00:27:59.960]   Sonos move.
[00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:05.720]   It's a surround sound experience in a really tiny package and is optimized to handle content
[00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:07.160]   formatted for Dolby Atmos.
[00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:10.080]   So that's why the upfiring speaker.
[00:28:10.080 --> 00:28:11.080]   It sounds terrific.
[00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:14.440]   It costs 200 bucks, 100 bucks less than the Sonos move.
[00:28:14.440 --> 00:28:21.000]   It will also take Amazon Fire TV, audio and sound and act like a sound bar, except she
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.240]   says, or maybe you said this.
[00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:25.480]   It feels like a Kevin Tofel line, except it's a sound ice bucket.
[00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:26.560]   No, it wasn't me.
[00:28:26.560 --> 00:28:29.640]   That was all hard.
[00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:31.240]   So Iro is being updated.
[00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:34.720]   There's an Iro Wi-Fi beacon product.
[00:28:34.720 --> 00:28:36.520]   It's still the same mesh tech.
[00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:38.840]   In fact, this is interesting.
[00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:44.840]   TP-Link, ASUS and Eris are also going to use Iro's TrueMesh technology.
[00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:50.360]   Now we have a de facto standard, even though she points out the Wi-Fi Alliance has its
[00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:52.440]   own mesh network standard.
[00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:55.160]   Iro seems to be kind of dominating here.
[00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:59.240]   Yeah, I wish she was here because she and I kind of agree on this.
[00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:03.920]   The E-Z Mesh standard came out maybe a year ago, and that was going to allow interoperability
[00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:09.240]   between say you bought an Iro router and you wanted to add some Google Wi-Fi beacons
[00:29:09.240 --> 00:29:10.480]   or access points.
[00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:14.680]   You could do that if E-Z Mesh was implemented, but that's not what's going on.
[00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:16.760]   Obviously, nobody's using it.
[00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:22.400]   And if people are glomming on at Iro's proprietary, E-Z Mesh isn't going to be around, I don't
[00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:23.400]   think.
[00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:27.360]   I think there should be an open standard, but Wi-Fi Alliance is not notoriously open,
[00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:31.640]   I might add, which is why they keep having trouble with their encryption specs web and
[00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:35.200]   now WPA2 because they don't publish those.
[00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:40.200]   And so crypto experts can't vet them before they implement them.
[00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:46.240]   So it may be good reason why nobody's adopting the Wi-Fi Alliance as a mesh standard.
[00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:48.240]   There's a new ring indoor camera.
[00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:53.040]   Ring of course made its name a long time sponsor on our network for their doorbells.
[00:29:53.040 --> 00:30:00.080]   They're going to build a $60 indoor camera, which still is not as cheap as the Wi-Fi,
[00:30:00.080 --> 00:30:04.720]   but maybe if it ties into Echo or maybe who knows.
[00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:12.680]   And there will be a ring alarm retrofit kit, which will connect to an existing security
[00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:15.560]   system hub already in their home.
[00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:17.320]   Ring has this alarm system.
[00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:20.160]   I don't understand, Kevin.
[00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:24.960]   So if you have say an older wired security system in your house and you want to, yeah,
[00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:29.360]   you want to expand it to have wireless connectivity, add new cameras and so on, instead of running
[00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:32.520]   wires, you would get this retrofit kit to tie it together.
[00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:33.520]   Nice.
[00:30:33.520 --> 00:30:37.120]   So you could take an existing, if you spent all the money wiring your home with an alarm
[00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:38.960]   system, you can reuse it.
[00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:42.720]   Is there a standard, how does it tie into the old system?
[00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:46.160]   The old systems are actually pretty basic, to be honest, Jeff.
[00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:49.640]   The reason people keep them around is because they have a direct phone line tie to maybe
[00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:54.080]   emergency services or a monitoring system and most of the newer things don't.
[00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:57.840]   So if you want to keep that service, because maybe it gives you peace of mind, you would
[00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:01.880]   then do this retrofit so you could add the newer modern sensors and things and still
[00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:02.880]   have your tie.
[00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:04.400]   Oh, I was thinking about the other one.
[00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:06.600]   You were tying your old system into the new in a way.
[00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:08.440]   This is tying your new system into the old.
[00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:09.440]   Right.
[00:31:09.440 --> 00:31:10.440]   In a sense, yeah.
[00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:11.440]   Yeah.
[00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:13.600]   And again, this is more of that barrier to entry.
[00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:17.040]   You know, it's just, you got a system in place already?
[00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:18.040]   We got you.
[00:31:18.040 --> 00:31:24.120]   We got the Ringstick Upcam is being updated, $99, $99, $100 and it works indoors outdoors
[00:31:24.120 --> 00:31:26.320]   or with a solar powered battery.
[00:31:26.320 --> 00:31:31.320]   So I mean, that's, you know, Ring as soon as Amazon bottom stopped advertising on our
[00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:33.760]   network, but I was all in on the Ring.
[00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:35.480]   I really liked their Ring stuff.
[00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:36.480]   Here's the smart oven.
[00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:40.920]   This is going to compete with the one of the Stacey says one job June.
[00:31:40.920 --> 00:31:43.800]   Oh, 250 bucks.
[00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:46.360]   That's less even than the newest June.
[00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:49.880]   So it's a, it's a convection oven.
[00:31:49.880 --> 00:31:50.880]   It's a microwave, I think.
[00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:51.880]   It's not a micro.
[00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:52.880]   Oh, it is a mic.
[00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:53.880]   No, no, no, no.
[00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:54.880]   They have a micro.
[00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:55.880]   No, this is a regular.
[00:31:55.880 --> 00:31:57.720]   It's a convention oven and an air fryer.
[00:31:57.720 --> 00:31:58.720]   Right.
[00:31:58.720 --> 00:31:59.720]   Right.
[00:31:59.720 --> 00:32:02.320]   Any convection oven is an air fryer, by the way.
[00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:03.320]   Yeah.
[00:32:03.320 --> 00:32:04.320]   Yeah.
[00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:05.320]   Yeah.
[00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:06.320]   Yeah.
[00:32:06.320 --> 00:32:07.320]   Yeah.
[00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:08.320]   This is similar to the June that Stacey and I both have and we bought the first version
[00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:09.320]   of that.
[00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:13.360]   So we paid out the Ying Yang for the $1500 and now it's down to $600 and I'd be curious to
[00:32:13.360 --> 00:32:16.960]   see if she gets a review unit of this because I'm very curious.
[00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:19.160]   How many toaster ovens does a girl need?
[00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:21.760]   How many road machines?
[00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:22.760]   Yeah.
[00:32:22.760 --> 00:32:26.000]   What does the June do that this doesn't do?
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:27.960]   June is Android based.
[00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:30.320]   So it doesn't have echo built into it.
[00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:33.360]   But you get downloaded recipes all the time.
[00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:35.920]   You get updates all the time.
[00:32:35.920 --> 00:32:37.520]   It has a camera in it, Jeff.
[00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:42.640]   So when you put food in, it detects what it is and then just basically presets all the
[00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:45.240]   temperature and time for the toaster oven.
[00:32:45.240 --> 00:32:46.240]   Come on.
[00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:47.240]   It's fantastic.
[00:32:47.240 --> 00:32:50.800]   Somebody explained to me why these are good ideas, these smart ovens.
[00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:53.000]   I've never come on over.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   I'll show you.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   It's easier.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   What was it?
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:00.160]   The smart microwave that had the ability to pop popcorn for you.
[00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:01.160]   That was dopey.
[00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:05.800]   But the June, I can from here see who's making toast in my house.
[00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:06.800]   Well, then.
[00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:07.800]   Right.
[00:33:07.800 --> 00:33:08.800]   Are you convinced?
[00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:11.640]   Is that good for you?
[00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:15.520]   So I'll preheat mine before I get home so that we're going to get home and so are you
[00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:16.520]   ready?
[00:33:16.520 --> 00:33:17.520]   Okay.
[00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:21.880]   And to be honest, because it's all algorithm based recipes, the food is always consistent.
[00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:22.880]   Yes.
[00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:23.880]   And it makes very good food.
[00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:24.880]   So you can say.
[00:33:24.880 --> 00:33:25.880]   It's the same every time.
[00:33:25.880 --> 00:33:28.880]   June, do your Brussels sprouts thing and it knows what to do.
[00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:32.000]   It turns on the convection when it needs to, broils when it needs to.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:33.560]   It makes it very simple.
[00:33:33.560 --> 00:33:34.560]   Okay.
[00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:35.640]   So do you make a bean dastard?
[00:33:35.640 --> 00:33:38.600]   It's ridiculously priced.
[00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:40.040]   Routine's for it?
[00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:41.040]   No.
[00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:42.040]   You can, can you?
[00:33:42.040 --> 00:33:44.040]   No, you really can't.
[00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:45.040]   That's weird.
[00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:49.120]   You think it would be an open source community of other.
[00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:55.720]   So what if you have one of those like subscription services for food and you go to put that
[00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:56.720]   in there?
[00:33:56.720 --> 00:33:57.720]   What happens?
[00:33:57.720 --> 00:34:02.320]   It scans that and assumes it's supposed to be cooked a certain temperature and so forth.
[00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:04.120]   Just you can do it manually.
[00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:05.120]   You can do it manually.
[00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:06.600]   It's a regular toaster oven.
[00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:07.600]   Okay.
[00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:09.240]   So you could do everything you would do with a regular toaster oven.
[00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:10.240]   Okay.
[00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:14.480]   So what it is, if you put a chicken breast in there, it would, the camera would say,
[00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:16.840]   chicken breast, would you like me to cook it?
[00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:17.840]   Okay.
[00:34:17.840 --> 00:34:18.960]   And it has a probe, which is nice.
[00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:21.280]   So you can have the internal temperature.
[00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:24.720]   So it's, it was way overpriced.
[00:34:24.720 --> 00:34:25.720]   What is the new price though?
[00:34:25.720 --> 00:34:26.720]   It's not 1500 bucks.
[00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:27.720]   It's 599.
[00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:29.520]   See, 599, not so.
[00:34:29.520 --> 00:34:31.080]   But now this is 250, the Amazon.
[00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:32.080]   That sounds, right.
[00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:33.080]   It's sounding better at 250.
[00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:36.640]   250 is what a Breville normal Breville toaster oven would cost.
[00:34:36.640 --> 00:34:40.800]   So if it's a decent toaster oven, that's actually a fair price.
[00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:46.840]   Echo Amazon is going to go into the earbud business, wireless noise canceling headphones
[00:34:46.840 --> 00:34:50.880]   with Amazon's Echo built in the Echo Buds.
[00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:51.880]   I love it though.
[00:34:51.880 --> 00:34:58.240]   It'll work with Google or Siri if you've got an Android or iPhone.
[00:34:58.240 --> 00:34:59.440]   That's surprising actually.
[00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:00.440]   Yeah.
[00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:04.840]   5 hours battery life in your ears, 20 hours in the case is one of those same things.
[00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:06.360]   The price is aggressive.
[00:35:06.360 --> 00:35:08.640]   Amazon's being very aggressive in pricing here.
[00:35:08.640 --> 00:35:12.160]   130 bucks is about 30 bucks less than the AirPods.
[00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:13.160]   Mm-hmm.
[00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:15.200]   They knew exactly what they were doing.
[00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:22.120]   Everything you've touched on in here was just a little bit less expensive than a competitor.
[00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:24.280]   You don't wear glasses, Ant.
[00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:26.400]   I do wear glasses just not often.
[00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:28.320]   Would you wear glasses you could talk to?
[00:35:28.320 --> 00:35:29.320]   Dane or you Vane.
[00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:32.120]   I'm not wearing, I'm wearing contacts.
[00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:33.120]   We're wearing contacts.
[00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:35.600]   I wear glasses just every now and then.
[00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:37.120]   Most of the time I can see okay.
[00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:38.120]   But like readers.
[00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:41.560]   No, they're regular prescription glasses.
[00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:48.400]   I can't imagine going through life with even the slightest fuzz.
[00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:51.520]   My eyes are actually not that bad.
[00:35:51.520 --> 00:35:56.920]   My eyes actually got a little bit better because I stopped wearing my glasses as often according
[00:35:56.920 --> 00:35:57.920]   to my doctor.
[00:35:57.920 --> 00:35:58.920]   Oh, that's true.
[00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:02.360]   If you put your glasses on right now though, when things look sharper to you than they
[00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:05.040]   do now, just slightly.
[00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:06.040]   Just slightly.
[00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:07.040]   Okay.
[00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:08.040]   I'm with you, Jeff.
[00:36:08.040 --> 00:36:12.640]   Although in order to wear contacts you have to sacrifice a cutie a little bit because your
[00:36:12.640 --> 00:36:15.120]   spectacles are more accurate than the contents.
[00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:16.120]   Oh really?
[00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:17.120]   Oh yeah.
[00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:18.120]   I never did that.
[00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:19.120]   Oh yeah.
[00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:20.120]   Curvature.
[00:36:20.120 --> 00:36:21.120]   Yeah.
[00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:22.120]   I'm just thinking about my glasses.
[00:36:22.120 --> 00:36:23.320]   When I put on my glasses everything gets just a little clearer and I'm kind of with you.
[00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:25.360]   It feels good when it's really clear.
[00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:26.960]   But my eye doctor said the same thing.
[00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:32.760]   You don't want your glasses to correct too perfectly because your eyes get lazy.
[00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:33.760]   Look at this guy.
[00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:34.760]   That's me.
[00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:35.760]   Is he lazy?
[00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:36.760]   Jeff, I believe.
[00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:37.760]   Look at him.
[00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:38.760]   Absolutely.
[00:36:38.760 --> 00:36:41.160]   So the glasses are also pretty clunky.
[00:36:41.160 --> 00:36:44.760]   Well, and it appears as a speaker, it's not bone induction.
[00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:46.360]   Oh, that would be so.
[00:36:46.360 --> 00:36:47.360]   Oh no.
[00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:48.360]   So everybody can hear Echo talk.
[00:36:48.360 --> 00:36:51.600]   So take a take a look at the go to the Amazon page.
[00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:52.600]   Echo front.
[00:36:52.600 --> 00:36:53.600]   Look at them there.
[00:36:53.600 --> 00:37:00.080]   $179.99 Google Assistant will also work.
[00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:01.640]   Let me hold on Carson.
[00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:04.600]   Let me go to the Amazon page and see if I can find him.
[00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:05.960]   So this is a beta.
[00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:10.600]   So you have to, you can go there, but you have to sign up and ask to be.
[00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:11.600]   Can I buy him now?
[00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:13.600]   No, I'm looking for Echo frames.
[00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:14.600]   Oh, that's pretty much.
[00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:15.600]   All I'm finding is.
[00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:16.600]   He's missing it.
[00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:17.600]   What?
[00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:18.600]   Right there.
[00:37:18.600 --> 00:37:19.600]   Go up.
[00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:20.600]   Yeah, put your glasses on.
[00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:21.600]   I wanted this digital.
[00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:22.600]   Oh yeah.
[00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:23.600]   That's the problem.
[00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:25.600]   I'm wearing contacts.
[00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:26.600]   Introducing.
[00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:29.880]   I like making Carson angry.
[00:37:29.880 --> 00:37:30.960]   Introducing Echo frames.
[00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:32.640]   Never minutes a moment.
[00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:35.040]   So you have to request an invitation.
[00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:36.200]   Should I request an invitation?
[00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:40.120]   You can't get your lenses, your glasses prescription in there.
[00:37:40.120 --> 00:37:41.120]   Yes.
[00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:42.120]   All right.
[00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:43.120]   Yeah.
[00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:44.120]   That means these are going to cost about $900 for me.
[00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:48.120]   What type of smartphone do you use daily?
[00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:49.120]   Both.
[00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:50.920]   How long do you wear prescription glasses every day?
[00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:52.680]   More than 10 hours.
[00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:54.800]   What size measurements are your existing glasses?
[00:37:54.800 --> 00:37:56.800]   Oh, I don't freaking know.
[00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:57.800]   Come on, Amazon.
[00:37:57.800 --> 00:37:58.800]   You got to do better.
[00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:02.040]   What's my lens with bridge width and temple length?
[00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:03.040]   Yeah.
[00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:04.040]   They're custom made.
[00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:05.040]   No, that's.
[00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:06.040]   All right.
[00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:07.040]   I'll sign up later.
[00:38:07.040 --> 00:38:11.040]   The Warby Parker and most of the glasses have these measurements printed on the inside of the
[00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:12.040]   inside.
[00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:14.120]   I know they will, but I don't have my glasses on.
[00:38:14.120 --> 00:38:15.520]   Actually.
[00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:16.520]   If somebody would bring my first.
[00:38:16.520 --> 00:38:18.520]   I can't read those little numbers without the glasses.
[00:38:18.520 --> 00:38:21.760]   Without my glasses, I can't read my glasses.
[00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:26.160]   45, 22, 142.
[00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:28.240]   You're my perfect, perfect woman.
[00:38:28.240 --> 00:38:30.640]   He's the guy that has the best eyes.
[00:38:30.640 --> 00:38:36.480]   45, 22, 152.
[00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:38.360]   Day one editions is what they call these.

[00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:47.480]   You're debate-attestable.
[00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:48.480]   Yeah.
[00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:51.360]   You know, hipsters like the big black frames, right?
[00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:52.360]   Scrolling.
[00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:53.360]   I'm not a hipster.
[00:38:53.360 --> 00:38:55.160]   There's the speaker.
[00:38:55.160 --> 00:38:57.520]   Amazon Open Ear technology.
[00:38:57.520 --> 00:38:59.120]   Direct sounds to your ears.
[00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:01.360]   Oh, you mean like a speaker?
[00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:03.240]   Opposed to your nose.
[00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:05.960]   Letting you discreetly access Alexa.
[00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:07.480]   Echo.
[00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:12.240]   With your ears uncovered, you'll be able to hear without blocking out the world around
[00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:13.240]   you.
[00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:14.240]   So people are going to hear.
[00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:15.240]   Yeah.
[00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:16.240]   There's annoying little voice.
[00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:18.280]   Can you imagine sitting there?
[00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:19.880]   You're having a lemonade.
[00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:21.200]   You say this lemonade is good.
[00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:24.760]   And you say echo and lemonade to my shopping list.
[00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:26.760]   That's going to be the new annoying.
[00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:27.760]   Don't it?
[00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:28.760]   So keep scrolling.
[00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:29.760]   Keep scrolling.
[00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:30.760]   Keep scrolling.
[00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:31.760]   Those frames look pretty good.
[00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:32.760]   It's okay.
[00:39:32.760 --> 00:39:33.760]   No, wait, wait, wait, keep going.
[00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:34.760]   Keep going.
[00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:35.760]   Keep going.
[00:39:35.760 --> 00:39:36.760]   Hope you and my.
[00:39:36.760 --> 00:39:37.760]   So now there's.
[00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:38.760]   Keep going.
[00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:39.760]   There's not a camera in them.
[00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:40.760]   Well, that's.
[00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:41.760]   No, there's no camera.
[00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:42.760]   Keep going to the picture of the glasses.
[00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:43.760]   Bear.
[00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:44.760]   Yeah.
[00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:45.760]   They're thick.
[00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:48.400]   That's for the battery.
[00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:49.800]   Also heavy.
[00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:52.000]   Mine are incredibly light these glasses.
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   Yeah.
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   Mine too.
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   Featherweight.
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   That is.
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   Those are heavy glasses.
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   That is a bit of a fail.
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   But what else could they do?
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:02.840]   They need to power him some kind of way and they need the tech somewhere.
[00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:07.160]   And I say this as somebody who wasted a fortune on Google Glass so I can't make fun.
[00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:08.160]   But you and me both.
[00:40:08.160 --> 00:40:09.160]   Don't worry, Jeff.
[00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:10.160]   You and me.
[00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:11.960]   And me, we spent as much as our June ovens.
[00:40:11.960 --> 00:40:12.960]   I was at two.
[00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:13.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:14.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:15.960]   I'm blowing money right there.
[00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:17.960]   I got I got the prescription version.
[00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:18.960]   Oh, even three.
[00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:19.960]   Oh, man.
[00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:20.960]   No, I did.
[00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:21.960]   Oh, wow.
[00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:22.960]   I can't see.
[00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:23.960]   Ouch.
[00:40:23.960 --> 00:40:24.960]   Ouch.
[00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:28.360]   You know, you can't see any numbers on these.
[00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:33.080]   You know, with all this with all this echo stuff coming out, I used to think when I go
[00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:37.800]   think back to the movie Her I used to think it would be Google that would be everywhere.
[00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:38.800]   I know.
[00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:40.200]   And now it seems like it's going to be Amazon.
[00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:42.640]   I just hope it's Scarlett Johansson.
[00:40:42.640 --> 00:40:44.640]   Echo frame.
[00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:46.640]   It's so nice to be sexist without.
[00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:50.320]   I was going to say there's more testosterone ever.
[00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:54.840]   So missing is a new genic sponsorship and Frank Thomas.
[00:40:54.840 --> 00:40:55.840]   Geez.
[00:40:55.840 --> 00:40:56.840]   I know.
[00:40:56.840 --> 00:40:57.840]   I'm sorry.
[00:40:57.840 --> 00:40:58.840]   The number on your glasses have worn off.
[00:40:58.840 --> 00:40:59.840]   It's worn off.
[00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:00.840]   I just see letters.
[00:41:00.840 --> 00:41:01.840]   Yeah.
[00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:03.440]   Well, I can go to my optometrist and say I don't want to get these.
[00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:05.640]   So your eyes were not deceiving you this time.
[00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:06.640]   They're gone.
[00:41:06.640 --> 00:41:07.640]   They're gone.
[00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:13.800]   Captive capacitive touch sensor ambient light sensor accelerometer.
[00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:19.080]   Sweat and water splash resistant IPX for to beam forming microphones.
[00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:24.280]   I don't really want to talk to echo all that's really what you get from this.
[00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:27.800]   You don't want to be without echo every anywhere ever.
[00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:29.520]   You're not getting a HUD.
[00:41:29.520 --> 00:41:30.520]   Right?
[00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:33.080]   Just no hugs and something in years.
[00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:37.720]   Echo loop titanium encased ring that also has a mic and tiny speaker.
[00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:46.600]   I'm 29 bucks haptic feedback so you know when Amazon's echo is listening invite only services
[00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:50.320]   sidewalk a new wireless protocol using the 900 speakers.
[00:41:50.320 --> 00:41:53.680]   So in other words speak to the hand.
[00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:54.680]   Yes.
[00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:55.680]   Talk to my ring.
[00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:56.680]   So title.
[00:41:56.680 --> 00:41:57.680]   Yeah.
[00:41:57.680 --> 00:41:58.680]   Yeah.
[00:41:58.680 --> 00:41:59.680]   Hard darling.
[00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:03.440]   Would you marry me and wear this speaker microphone enabled ring for the rest of your
[00:42:03.440 --> 00:42:04.440]   life.
[00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:05.440]   It's going to track you wherever you go.
[00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:07.680]   So I know you're not going to do anything to ask you without me.
[00:42:07.680 --> 00:42:08.680]   Wow.
[00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:09.680]   Right.
[00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:10.680]   Sidewalk.
[00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:11.680]   Right.
[00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:18.560]   It was is low bandwidth services over long distances.
[00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:24.600]   So it's really for the ring doorbells which are often too far from Wi-Fi to be usable.
[00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:26.440]   Oh is that it?
[00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:27.440]   Okay.
[00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:31.740]   They created their new it's not it's not there are standards as Stacy points out there's
[00:42:31.740 --> 00:42:40.340]   low route when and a sig Fox but they've decided to create another low power when protocol.
[00:42:40.340 --> 00:42:44.500]   Amazon spent some time focused on celebrity voices for the echo including a newly launched
[00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:45.980]   ability to have.
[00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:47.460]   I love this.
[00:42:47.460 --> 00:42:51.700]   Samuel L. Jackson on your vice in an explicit or clean version.
[00:42:51.700 --> 00:42:54.460]   This provoked titters in the audience again.
[00:42:54.460 --> 00:42:59.420]   Now there's Stacy is in but then also said having Jackson yelling the weather at you
[00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:02.580]   would cost 99 cents.
[00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:05.980]   Amazon has several subscription offerings with prime music prime music.
[00:43:05.980 --> 00:43:12.820]   Eero security services now with echo services of the new black aren't they that's what apples
[00:43:12.820 --> 00:43:16.940]   wants everybody wants.
[00:43:16.940 --> 00:43:24.820]   New partnership with the food network by Amazon I have to say Amazon is is pretty both impressive
[00:43:24.820 --> 00:43:26.620]   and aggressive.
[00:43:26.620 --> 00:43:32.700]   All about all the hooks and what's funny is I got the strong sense that they didn't expect
[00:43:32.700 --> 00:43:38.220]   echo to be that important when they first released it and it just took off but Amazon
[00:43:38.220 --> 00:43:39.660]   has done this time and time again.
[00:43:39.660 --> 00:43:47.340]   AWS I think that there was a whole lot of you know as much data as they deal with they
[00:43:47.340 --> 00:43:51.860]   just were looking for another way to harvest and this was it.
[00:43:51.860 --> 00:43:55.380]   But does it feel like some of these products are just thrown up against the wall and see
[00:43:55.380 --> 00:43:56.380]   what sticks.
[00:43:56.380 --> 00:43:57.380]   I mean there's a lot of.
[00:43:57.380 --> 00:43:58.380]   Amazon has always done that.
[00:43:58.380 --> 00:44:00.020]   Yeah that's their MO.
[00:44:00.020 --> 00:44:01.020]   I guess.
[00:44:01.020 --> 00:44:04.020]   I remember the dot buttons.
[00:44:04.020 --> 00:44:05.020]   The dash buttons.
[00:44:05.020 --> 00:44:09.100]   No no no no not the dash buttons.
[00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:10.100]   The dot buttons.
[00:44:10.100 --> 00:44:17.100]   They actually had like a game show style but oh yeah yeah.
[00:44:17.100 --> 00:44:18.340]   Yes yes yes.
[00:44:18.340 --> 00:44:19.340]   That didn't go anywhere.
[00:44:19.340 --> 00:44:21.300]   They've done a lot of stuff that's fine.
[00:44:21.300 --> 00:44:23.540]   That's what you should you know what that's called innovation.
[00:44:23.540 --> 00:44:31.700]   Yeah well fire funds are notoriously worst thing but I think that's great.
[00:44:31.700 --> 00:44:36.460]   And here's a Deeter Bones picture before we go to break because we also have a lot of
[00:44:36.460 --> 00:44:43.900]   other announcements to talk about Deeter Bones picture of the torquing bear.
[00:44:43.900 --> 00:44:45.820]   Wow.
[00:44:45.820 --> 00:44:48.340]   Everybody should have a.
[00:44:48.340 --> 00:44:51.980]   I like it that it you know so I bought last year I bought the big mouth Billy Bass that
[00:44:51.980 --> 00:44:53.900]   Amazon Echo talks thrilling.
[00:44:53.900 --> 00:44:55.980]   I got that for a kid he wouldn't set it up.
[00:44:55.980 --> 00:44:57.220]   He was spooked by it.
[00:44:57.220 --> 00:44:58.940]   Oh okay you bought it for the kid.
[00:44:58.940 --> 00:45:01.100]   I got I got it for myself right.
[00:45:01.100 --> 00:45:02.620]   Did he set it up?
[00:45:02.620 --> 00:45:04.100]   Yeah he set it up.
[00:45:04.100 --> 00:45:05.980]   I didn't realize by the way I apologize.
[00:45:05.980 --> 00:45:07.940]   I didn't realize Zach was sold now.
[00:45:07.940 --> 00:45:10.580]   No that's Alex actually Alex is sold.
[00:45:10.580 --> 00:45:12.380]   Well Zach sold too.
[00:45:12.380 --> 00:45:14.740]   Zach Zach is 15 Alex is 12.
[00:45:14.740 --> 00:45:16.180]   I can't believe they're so old.
[00:45:16.180 --> 00:45:17.180]   They're so old.
[00:45:17.180 --> 00:45:19.020]   Geez Louise.
[00:45:19.020 --> 00:45:22.460]   I apologize I for some reason I thought they were still little kids.
[00:45:22.460 --> 00:45:23.660]   They are in my heart.
[00:45:23.660 --> 00:45:25.180]   I know it goes so fast.
[00:45:25.180 --> 00:45:26.180]   I know.
[00:45:26.180 --> 00:45:30.660]   Let's take a little break perhaps you notice I know you did how sharp I look at my new
[00:45:30.660 --> 00:45:31.660]   dapper.
[00:45:31.660 --> 00:45:32.660]   Hey this shirt.
[00:45:32.660 --> 00:45:33.660]   Yes.
[00:45:33.660 --> 00:45:34.660]   Is that a nice shirt?
[00:45:34.660 --> 00:45:39.660]   This is a very short I've had that actually fits me in years and I got it.
[00:45:39.660 --> 00:45:41.460]   You won't believe how I got it.
[00:45:41.460 --> 00:45:47.140]   It's a tailored shirt made to order for me and the only thing I had to do to get it measured
[00:45:47.140 --> 00:45:50.380]   was take a picture of myself with my smartphone.
[00:45:50.380 --> 00:45:51.580]   It works.
[00:45:51.580 --> 00:45:53.740]   It's a tailor store.
[00:45:53.740 --> 00:45:55.980]   It is amazing.
[00:45:55.980 --> 00:45:57.460]   I have now ordered.
[00:45:57.460 --> 00:45:58.460]   I have a done effect.
[00:45:58.460 --> 00:45:59.460]   Shall I show you?
[00:45:59.460 --> 00:46:01.460]   I got us some more.
[00:46:01.460 --> 00:46:07.140]   So first of all when you go to Taylor store.com/twig you're really going to enjoy the process
[00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:12.300]   because you first you get yourself measured and they and they you do it very quickly.
[00:46:12.300 --> 00:46:13.300]   It's very easy.
[00:46:13.300 --> 00:46:15.740]   It's so weird you put the phone on the ground.
[00:46:15.740 --> 00:46:16.740]   I should do it.
[00:46:16.740 --> 00:46:17.740]   I'll show you.
[00:46:17.740 --> 00:46:18.740]   Put the phone on the ground.
[00:46:18.740 --> 00:46:21.500]   You should do it because it'd be hard for you to get shirts I bet.
[00:46:21.500 --> 00:46:22.500]   It is.
[00:46:22.500 --> 00:46:23.900]   This is why I'm so intrigued by this.
[00:46:23.900 --> 00:46:27.780]   So you put the phone on the ground you stand that gives you a frame to stand in and then
[00:46:27.780 --> 00:46:31.420]   you it takes a couple of pictures automatically and that's all.
[00:46:31.420 --> 00:46:32.420]   You turn sideways.
[00:46:32.420 --> 00:46:38.140]   It's like your mugshot before it's only two pictures but they're using machine learning
[00:46:38.140 --> 00:46:43.660]   and statistics to get your measurements and I you know I can only speak for myself.
[00:46:43.660 --> 00:46:44.860]   It was it's perfect.
[00:46:44.860 --> 00:46:46.860]   This fits perfectly.
[00:46:46.860 --> 00:46:48.940]   We have to have this tested on me as well.
[00:46:48.940 --> 00:46:50.180]   Okay deal.
[00:46:50.180 --> 00:46:53.580]   And then and then you go in and the store and you can customize it any way you want.
[00:46:53.580 --> 00:46:56.060]   So I got very normal preppy.
[00:46:56.060 --> 00:46:57.620]   This is the shirt we're going to give you by the way.
[00:46:57.620 --> 00:46:58.620]   This is that we got a special.
[00:46:58.620 --> 00:46:59.620]   Classic shirt.
[00:46:59.620 --> 00:47:00.620]   Isn't that nice class?
[00:47:00.620 --> 00:47:01.620]   But you get different buttons.
[00:47:01.620 --> 00:47:02.620]   You get a different thread.
[00:47:02.620 --> 00:47:03.620]   You can get different color styles.
[00:47:03.620 --> 00:47:05.540]   They have spread all kinds of colors.
[00:47:05.540 --> 00:47:06.900]   You can get cufflink styles.
[00:47:06.900 --> 00:47:08.180]   You can get button style.
[00:47:08.180 --> 00:47:09.180]   It goes on and on.
[00:47:09.180 --> 00:47:13.340]   It's actually almost you can you know if you want to make it easy they have a selection
[00:47:13.340 --> 00:47:15.540]   of just like this is it it's done.
[00:47:15.540 --> 00:47:17.100]   But if you like to customize look at this.
[00:47:17.100 --> 00:47:18.860]   This is I also got this.
[00:47:18.860 --> 00:47:20.820]   So this is got flamingos on it.
[00:47:20.820 --> 00:47:21.820]   I haven't opened it yet.
[00:47:21.820 --> 00:47:24.420]   I'm going to put this on and I'll wear it tomorrow.
[00:47:24.420 --> 00:47:25.780]   Spread color.
[00:47:25.780 --> 00:47:26.980]   I think this is really cool.
[00:47:26.980 --> 00:47:30.460]   So they have I got a lot of white shirts but I also maybe you noticed the other day I was
[00:47:30.460 --> 00:47:34.380]   wearing a black shirt that was also from a tailor store.
[00:47:34.380 --> 00:47:36.300]   So this is booty essentially.
[00:47:36.300 --> 00:47:37.300]   Yep.
[00:47:37.300 --> 00:47:42.220]   So the size colon me app is absolutely unique.
[00:47:42.220 --> 00:47:43.380]   No tape measure.
[00:47:43.380 --> 00:47:45.060]   No hassle.
[00:47:45.060 --> 00:47:47.940]   If by the way this is another thing now Jason howl did it.
[00:47:47.940 --> 00:47:50.540]   Now remember he's 18 feet tall.
[00:47:50.540 --> 00:47:54.060]   So when the first shirt that they sent him didn't quite wasn't quite right.
[00:47:54.060 --> 00:47:56.420]   He said no needs to be longer tail right.
[00:47:56.420 --> 00:47:58.020]   They said fine we'll send you another one.
[00:47:58.020 --> 00:47:59.020]   Keep that shirt.
[00:47:59.020 --> 00:48:01.620]   You don't even send it back if it doesn't fit perfectly.
[00:48:01.620 --> 00:48:02.620]   Nice.
[00:48:02.620 --> 00:48:06.500]   You keep the shirt they sent you donated charity if he really doesn't fit or whatever.
[00:48:06.500 --> 00:48:10.620]   You have it to your buddy and then they'll send you a new one.
[00:48:10.620 --> 00:48:12.460]   So there's no risk at all.
[00:48:12.460 --> 00:48:14.100]   Here's the other thing I think is really important.
[00:48:14.100 --> 00:48:15.700]   I want to emphasize this.
[00:48:15.700 --> 00:48:17.580]   This is a Swedish company.
[00:48:17.580 --> 00:48:24.820]   They make the shirts in Sri Lanka in a certified I don't know what the equivalent of fair
[00:48:24.820 --> 00:48:30.140]   trade is actually I do it's called GOTS global organic textile standard.
[00:48:30.140 --> 00:48:34.820]   They are certified with the workers they go there all the time at the workers are well
[00:48:34.820 --> 00:48:37.700]   paid well taken care of it's not sweatshot labor.
[00:48:37.700 --> 00:48:41.380]   They use organic fabrics.
[00:48:41.380 --> 00:48:43.340]   It is absolutely conscious.
[00:48:43.340 --> 00:48:47.700]   They told me they got so big that they had they basically took over an entire town in
[00:48:47.700 --> 00:48:48.700]   Sri Lanka.
[00:48:48.700 --> 00:48:51.940]   Everybody works for Taylor store and now they've moved to the next town.
[00:48:51.940 --> 00:48:54.180]   But these people are getting great jobs.
[00:48:54.180 --> 00:48:56.060]   They love Taylor store.
[00:48:56.060 --> 00:48:59.740]   So you can also buy these shirts knowing they're not being made in the sweatshop somewhere
[00:48:59.740 --> 00:49:00.740]   in China.
[00:49:00.740 --> 00:49:04.220]   These are made by a socially conscious company.
[00:49:04.220 --> 00:49:05.220]   I love this.
[00:49:05.220 --> 00:49:06.460]   They're also 100% carbon neutral.
[00:49:06.460 --> 00:49:07.620]   They actually inspired me.
[00:49:07.620 --> 00:49:09.860]   We're going to make Twitter 100% carbon neutral.
[00:49:09.860 --> 00:49:13.780]   They buy offsets and plant thousands of trees a year.
[00:49:13.780 --> 00:49:18.940]   They buy offsets not just for the cost of shipping the clothing or making the clothing.
[00:49:18.940 --> 00:49:23.100]   They buy offsets for the cost of driving to work for every employee.
[00:49:23.100 --> 00:49:28.780]   They basically neutralize their CO2 emissions by planning trees.
[00:49:28.780 --> 00:49:30.940]   In fact, if you ever want this is another offer.
[00:49:30.940 --> 00:49:33.740]   They said if you ever in Sri Lanka, this is for any of you.
[00:49:33.740 --> 00:49:35.420]   You want to visit the factory.
[00:49:35.420 --> 00:49:37.380]   You can see how it's made.
[00:49:37.380 --> 00:49:42.180]   But I also love this because they email you a picture of your shirt being made as it's
[00:49:42.180 --> 00:49:43.180]   being made.
[00:49:43.180 --> 00:49:44.180]   Your shirts are being made.
[00:49:44.180 --> 00:49:45.180]   Here's your shirt.
[00:49:45.180 --> 00:49:48.940]   It'll be there in a couple of days.
[00:49:48.940 --> 00:49:51.300]   Used to be getting a made to measure shirt was a luxury.
[00:49:51.300 --> 00:49:52.300]   I've always wanted one.
[00:49:52.300 --> 00:49:54.100]   I never thought I could do it.
[00:49:54.100 --> 00:49:56.900]   Taylor store does it.
[00:49:56.900 --> 00:50:00.100]   And it's so nice when your shirt fits perfectly.
[00:50:00.100 --> 00:50:03.420]   Look, I never could button my collar.
[00:50:03.420 --> 00:50:07.180]   I never, I don't know how I know exactly what my collar size is.
[00:50:07.180 --> 00:50:10.820]   I can wear a necktie completely comfortably.
[00:50:10.820 --> 00:50:12.020]   This is a first for me.
[00:50:12.020 --> 00:50:13.500]   That looks good.
[00:50:13.500 --> 00:50:16.620]   With their exclusive trial price, I've kind of buried the lead.
[00:50:16.620 --> 00:50:22.260]   Every new customer gets their first dress shirt starting at $39 plus free shipping.
[00:50:22.260 --> 00:50:24.460]   That's half the regular price.
[00:50:24.460 --> 00:50:28.340]   And boy, go check how much a tailored shirt costs is a lot less.
[00:50:28.340 --> 00:50:34.260]   Go to Taylorstore.com/twig, offer code twig, free shipping, $39 your first shirt.
[00:50:34.260 --> 00:50:36.260]   You owe it to yourself just to try it.
[00:50:36.260 --> 00:50:39.260]   There are lots of beautiful fabrics and patterns, all kinds.
[00:50:39.260 --> 00:50:42.460]   Taylorstore.com/twig, you can get the flamingo if you want.
[00:50:42.460 --> 00:50:43.460]   I can't wait to wear that.
[00:50:43.460 --> 00:50:45.100]   That is such a cool shirt.
[00:50:45.100 --> 00:50:47.100]   Taylorstore.com/twig, offer code twig.
[00:50:47.100 --> 00:50:50.540]   The brand new sponsor, Terms and Conditions, apply.
[00:50:50.540 --> 00:50:51.700]   Really great Swedish company.
[00:50:51.700 --> 00:50:56.140]   Long time listeners of Twit, I'm just thrilled you could get them on the show.
[00:50:56.140 --> 00:51:03.180]   It was really fun to talk to them and find out what they're doing.
[00:51:03.180 --> 00:51:04.180]   Thank you, Taylorstore.
[00:51:04.180 --> 00:51:07.100]   Thank you for using that special address so that you know you saw it here.
[00:51:07.100 --> 00:51:11.580]   We want them to know that they did the right thing by Twig.
[00:51:11.580 --> 00:51:15.020]   Taylorstore.com/twig, offer code twig.
[00:51:15.020 --> 00:51:17.180]   Did I cover all the Amazon crap?
[00:51:17.180 --> 00:51:18.180]   I mean, stuff.
[00:51:18.180 --> 00:51:19.180]   No, no, no.
[00:51:19.180 --> 00:51:20.180]   There's more.
[00:51:20.180 --> 00:51:21.980]   No, very important.
[00:51:21.980 --> 00:51:24.460]   Fetch, Amazon Fetch.
[00:51:24.460 --> 00:51:26.660]   Is it a little dog that gets...
[00:51:26.660 --> 00:51:28.500]   No, it's a collar.
[00:51:28.500 --> 00:51:30.260]   Wait, I wasn't joking.
[00:51:30.260 --> 00:51:33.060]   At the beginning of the show, I was asking whether Norm was going to be wearing Amazon
[00:51:33.060 --> 00:51:34.060]   Fetch.
[00:51:34.060 --> 00:51:35.860]   It is an echo-enabled collar.
[00:51:35.860 --> 00:51:37.900]   Oh, no, it's a pet tracker.
[00:51:37.900 --> 00:51:44.900]   This uses that new low frequency wide-area network sidewalk.
[00:51:44.900 --> 00:51:47.700]   Oh, it is like a little tile.
[00:51:47.700 --> 00:51:49.100]   It would hang off your collar.
[00:51:49.100 --> 00:51:50.340]   That looks maybe a little big for Norm.
[00:51:50.340 --> 00:51:51.340]   I don't know.
[00:51:51.340 --> 00:51:52.340]   What do you think?
[00:51:52.340 --> 00:51:53.340]   Yeah, that's too big for him.
[00:51:53.340 --> 00:51:54.340]   Yeah.
[00:51:54.340 --> 00:51:55.340]   Little guy.
[00:51:55.340 --> 00:51:58.780]   He's a private little bichon anyway.
[00:51:58.780 --> 00:51:59.780]   He stays inside.
[00:51:59.780 --> 00:52:00.780]   He stays with you, right?
[00:52:00.780 --> 00:52:01.780]   Oh, yeah.
[00:52:01.780 --> 00:52:03.180]   And he's on a leash when we take him out.
[00:52:03.180 --> 00:52:07.220]   Anytime you let a dog though out, no, Kevin stays with Norm.
[00:52:07.220 --> 00:52:09.220]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:52:09.220 --> 00:52:10.220]   That's very true.
[00:52:10.220 --> 00:52:11.220]   Yes.
[00:52:11.220 --> 00:52:12.220]   The other way around.
[00:52:12.220 --> 00:52:13.220]   I live in Norm's world.
[00:52:13.220 --> 00:52:14.220]   But you have a couple of dogs.
[00:52:14.220 --> 00:52:15.220]   You let them out?
[00:52:15.220 --> 00:52:16.220]   Oh, yeah.
[00:52:16.220 --> 00:52:17.220]   Yeah.
[00:52:17.220 --> 00:52:18.220]   So I think it's good to have this kind of tag.
[00:52:18.220 --> 00:52:19.220]   So without the mesh, does it really work?
[00:52:19.220 --> 00:52:23.900]   So it says here that Amazon handed out 700 devices to employees, friends, and family
[00:52:23.900 --> 00:52:27.420]   and had the LA base and completely covered by the network in three weeks.
[00:52:27.420 --> 00:52:28.420]   Oh, wow.
[00:52:28.420 --> 00:52:29.420]   So that's meshing, right?
[00:52:29.420 --> 00:52:32.180]   Oh, so it's a mesh network.
[00:52:32.180 --> 00:52:35.340]   So if there's people nearby that have it, that's why they do it with ring as well.
[00:52:35.340 --> 00:52:36.340]   I get it.
[00:52:36.340 --> 00:52:37.340]   That makes sense.
[00:52:37.340 --> 00:52:38.340]   I get it.
[00:52:38.340 --> 00:52:39.340]   Yeah, I think of it.
[00:52:39.340 --> 00:52:41.580]   It's almost like the tile Bluetooth trackers which uses crowdsource.
[00:52:41.580 --> 00:52:42.580]   Yeah.
[00:52:42.580 --> 00:52:43.580]   Call it.
[00:52:43.580 --> 00:52:44.580]   It's not a mesh.
[00:52:44.580 --> 00:52:45.580]   You're the first one with it.
[00:52:45.580 --> 00:52:46.580]   Is it worthless?
[00:52:46.580 --> 00:52:47.580]   I guess so.
[00:52:47.580 --> 00:52:51.260]   Well, unless it has some Wi-Fi thing or something else built in it.
[00:52:51.260 --> 00:52:56.300]   I wouldn't say worthless, Jeff, because you should, if your pet is within about half a
[00:52:56.300 --> 00:53:01.140]   mile, well, 500 meters, so a little more than quarter mile, you should still, I'm assuming,
[00:53:01.140 --> 00:53:03.620]   see where they are on the app because they'd still be in range.
[00:53:03.620 --> 00:53:04.620]   Oh, I see.
[00:53:04.620 --> 00:53:05.620]   Yeah.
[00:53:05.620 --> 00:53:06.620]   This is interesting.
[00:53:06.620 --> 00:53:08.140]   And Norm has short legs.
[00:53:08.140 --> 00:53:09.500]   He'd never even go 500 meters.
[00:53:09.500 --> 00:53:11.940]   Let me ask, though, an ontological question.
[00:53:11.940 --> 00:53:15.420]   Do we trust Amazon?
[00:53:15.420 --> 00:53:16.420]   I think most people do.
[00:53:16.420 --> 00:53:17.420]   With your dogs?
[00:53:17.420 --> 00:53:18.420]   With anything.
[00:53:18.420 --> 00:53:19.420]   Look at this.
[00:53:19.420 --> 00:53:24.500]   Basically, this is a play to put Amazon within five feet of you no matter where you are.
[00:53:24.500 --> 00:53:25.500]   Right?
[00:53:25.500 --> 00:53:26.500]   Yeah.
[00:53:26.500 --> 00:53:33.260]   I trust them just as much as I trust Google because of the services that they provide
[00:53:33.260 --> 00:53:35.060]   for me and my day to day.
[00:53:35.060 --> 00:53:36.300]   Get a lot of value.
[00:53:36.300 --> 00:53:37.300]   That is it.
[00:53:37.300 --> 00:53:41.060]   And I know that I am, well, actually, I'm not the customer.
[00:53:41.060 --> 00:53:44.260]   My data is the customer and the product for them.
[00:53:44.260 --> 00:53:45.540]   And I get it.
[00:53:45.540 --> 00:53:49.460]   At the same time, they provide a great service in my day to day life.
[00:53:49.460 --> 00:53:50.460]   So, yes.
[00:53:50.460 --> 00:53:55.140]   Actually, unlike Google and Facebook, the customer at Google and Facebook is an advertiser.
[00:53:55.140 --> 00:53:57.700]   It has Amazon, makes a lot of money in ads.
[00:53:57.700 --> 00:53:59.660]   But really, you are the customer at Amazon.
[00:53:59.660 --> 00:54:00.660]   Yeah.
[00:54:00.660 --> 00:54:03.500]   Because I'm making more and more and more money on ads.
[00:54:03.500 --> 00:54:04.500]   Yeah.
[00:54:04.500 --> 00:54:06.180]   So do you think, OK, so that's the question.
[00:54:06.180 --> 00:54:12.740]   I mean, if Amazon does all this on your behalf as the customer, that's good.
[00:54:12.740 --> 00:54:15.940]   If they do it on behalf of an advertiser, is that bad?
[00:54:15.940 --> 00:54:17.940]   No, I trust them.
[00:54:17.940 --> 00:54:18.940]   I trust them.
[00:54:18.940 --> 00:54:19.940]   I was convincing.
[00:54:19.940 --> 00:54:22.940]   No, just because, you know what?
[00:54:22.940 --> 00:54:27.300]   Because all of the moral, panicky, dystopian people out there are going to come smashing
[00:54:27.300 --> 00:54:29.460]   down on them the first time they do something wrong.
[00:54:29.460 --> 00:54:30.980]   That's a good point.
[00:54:30.980 --> 00:54:31.980]   They did, didn't they?
[00:54:31.980 --> 00:54:36.580]   When people found out that Amazon was listening to recordings and answers a ridiculous story
[00:54:36.580 --> 00:54:38.380]   in and of itself, because of course they were.
[00:54:38.380 --> 00:54:41.060]   It wasn't a big deal and they didn't know all your secrets.
[00:54:41.060 --> 00:54:42.980]   They were just doing quality assurance.
[00:54:42.980 --> 00:54:46.500]   But fine, everybody came pressing down on them.
[00:54:46.500 --> 00:54:47.500]   Yep.
[00:54:47.500 --> 00:54:48.500]   OK.
[00:54:48.500 --> 00:54:50.140]   It was a moral panic.
[00:54:50.140 --> 00:54:54.700]   I trust them enough because, again, with the way cookies and everything else, where
[00:54:54.700 --> 00:55:01.220]   Amazon seems to get what Ant Pruitt needs to have for day to day services, whatever.
[00:55:01.220 --> 00:55:03.860]   You know, and I don't have to think very hard about it.
[00:55:03.860 --> 00:55:10.420]   If I'm looking for a piece of hardware or what have you for a camera, a photo gig, it already
[00:55:10.420 --> 00:55:13.100]   knows what I'm looking for before I start looking.
[00:55:13.100 --> 00:55:15.700]   So I bought this new camera.
[00:55:15.700 --> 00:55:17.580]   I bought it from B&H, right?
[00:55:17.580 --> 00:55:19.540]   And I bought the lens from B&H.
[00:55:19.540 --> 00:55:21.060]   I ordered it in July.
[00:55:21.060 --> 00:55:22.940]   I got it last week.
[00:55:22.940 --> 00:55:27.020]   So when I came time to buy another lens for this camera, this time I went to Amazon.
[00:55:27.020 --> 00:55:29.620]   I got it one day.
[00:55:29.620 --> 00:55:32.260]   So it's hard not to use it.
[00:55:32.260 --> 00:55:33.260]   Exactly.
[00:55:33.260 --> 00:55:37.580]   So you're people complain about all of the energy that they use.
[00:55:37.580 --> 00:55:43.860]   But six days ago, so I guess it's within the period of the show, Bezos announced a sustainability
[00:55:43.860 --> 00:55:52.460]   plan and just beating his employees to threatening to walk out because of this.
[00:55:52.460 --> 00:55:56.340]   But he says he's going to drastically reduce carbon emissions with an ultimate goal of being
[00:55:56.340 --> 00:55:57.700]   carbon neutral by 2040.
[00:55:57.700 --> 00:56:03.180]   And to consider how they're mainly a transportation company, that's a big ask.
[00:56:03.180 --> 00:56:06.380]   Let me ask you about this because we were just talking about carbon neutral.
[00:56:06.380 --> 00:56:13.900]   I have a big vacation coming up that it turns out jet airplanes are horrible on the environment.
[00:56:13.900 --> 00:56:15.300]   But you know what's worse?
[00:56:15.300 --> 00:56:16.300]   Cruise ships.
[00:56:16.300 --> 00:56:17.300]   Lisa and I.
[00:56:17.300 --> 00:56:18.300]   Oh my god.
[00:56:18.300 --> 00:56:19.300]   Golly.
[00:56:19.300 --> 00:56:21.700]   Lisa and I are taking a two week cruise.
[00:56:21.700 --> 00:56:24.420]   I did the carbon calculations on it.
[00:56:24.420 --> 00:56:29.700]   That two week cruise for two people uses more puts more carbon in the atmosphere than one
[00:56:29.700 --> 00:56:31.420]   Englishman for a whole year.
[00:56:31.420 --> 00:56:32.820]   I did not know that.
[00:56:32.820 --> 00:56:34.420]   Wow.
[00:56:34.420 --> 00:56:37.380]   So let me ask you so that made me feel terrible.
[00:56:37.380 --> 00:56:40.140]   So I bought carbon credits.
[00:56:40.140 --> 00:56:44.780]   Now you have to research because there's carbon credits and there's carbon credits.
[00:56:44.780 --> 00:56:45.780]   Of course.
[00:56:45.780 --> 00:56:46.780]   I had one that was recommended.
[00:56:46.780 --> 00:56:48.980]   I like some carbon credits and fell off the bike.
[00:56:48.980 --> 00:56:49.980]   Hey buddy.
[00:56:49.980 --> 00:56:55.140]   I had one that was for air travel that was recommended by the Yale School of Environment
[00:56:55.140 --> 00:56:56.140]   Forestry.
[00:56:56.140 --> 00:56:58.500]   They really I think knew what they were talking about.
[00:56:58.500 --> 00:57:00.060]   So I used that one.
[00:57:00.060 --> 00:57:04.380]   And then I used I also looked around, shopped around and I think I found one that was recommended
[00:57:04.380 --> 00:57:07.500]   by the Washington Post for the cruise.
[00:57:07.500 --> 00:57:10.420]   And you know the truth is carbon credits are not expensive.
[00:57:10.420 --> 00:57:14.820]   It might be it's less than 1% of the overall cost.
[00:57:14.820 --> 00:57:17.860]   But am I a sucker?
[00:57:17.860 --> 00:57:18.860]   Or is this a good thing?
[00:57:18.860 --> 00:57:20.020]   Should people do this?
[00:57:20.020 --> 00:57:21.020]   Or you guilty?
[00:57:21.020 --> 00:57:22.020]   Or is that what you're asking?
[00:57:22.020 --> 00:57:23.020]   Yes, I was guilty.
[00:57:23.020 --> 00:57:24.900]   My guilt is a little assuage.
[00:57:24.900 --> 00:57:28.220]   But after all, I should the better thing to do would be not take the trip.
[00:57:28.220 --> 00:57:29.220]   Not the trip.
[00:57:29.220 --> 00:57:30.220]   Well, if you're running out of your car.
[00:57:30.220 --> 00:57:32.820]   You can't take the sale the the sailboat with a third.
[00:57:32.820 --> 00:57:35.300]   You're out for three weeks.
[00:57:35.300 --> 00:57:37.700]   Not bless her after I saw her speech at the UN.
[00:57:37.700 --> 00:57:40.100]   That's when I really started to feel bad.
[00:57:40.100 --> 00:57:41.820]   She's one of those people.
[00:57:41.820 --> 00:57:45.700]   She said, you know, basically it's how dare you.
[00:57:45.700 --> 00:57:46.700]   Okay.
[00:57:46.700 --> 00:57:47.700]   Okay, credit.
[00:57:47.700 --> 00:57:51.140]   Do the state rooms have options for ores?
[00:57:51.140 --> 00:57:52.700]   Like could you paddle and stuff?
[00:57:52.700 --> 00:57:53.700]   No, that's the thing.
[00:57:53.700 --> 00:58:00.380]   And it really is I like to travel and and travel is no is notoriously bad unless you're
[00:58:00.380 --> 00:58:06.380]   walking or bicycling or sailing or taking a train.
[00:58:06.380 --> 00:58:10.180]   And you know, so.
[00:58:10.180 --> 00:58:12.900]   Probably the world's worst when it comes to my environment.
[00:58:12.900 --> 00:58:15.460]   So I shouldn't be asked this question.
[00:58:15.460 --> 00:58:16.460]   You know what?
[00:58:16.460 --> 00:58:17.460]   We all are.
[00:58:17.460 --> 00:58:21.180]   So good for good for good for Amazon for doing something about it.
[00:58:21.180 --> 00:58:23.060]   They're not just buying credits by the way.
[00:58:23.060 --> 00:58:27.420]   As as this story tells you, they ordered a hundred thousand Rivian electric trucks for
[00:58:27.420 --> 00:58:28.420]   delivery.
[00:58:28.420 --> 00:58:29.820]   What an order, huh?
[00:58:29.820 --> 00:58:30.820]   That's amazing.
[00:58:30.820 --> 00:58:34.700]   But that but that tells you that they have a real company.
[00:58:34.700 --> 00:58:35.700]   Yeah.
[00:58:35.700 --> 00:58:37.700]   They stop to fly this.
[00:58:37.700 --> 00:58:41.380]   You know, USPS should have been doing this years ago.
[00:58:41.380 --> 00:58:45.380]   Those they this perfect for electric use.
[00:58:45.380 --> 00:58:46.380]   Yeah.
[00:58:46.380 --> 00:58:49.260]   And that's one of the reasons that we drive I drive an electric car.
[00:58:49.260 --> 00:58:50.260]   Right.
[00:58:50.260 --> 00:58:53.300]   We have solar 60 solar panels on the roof.
[00:58:53.300 --> 00:58:58.780]   But honestly, the carbon footprint every American has is is devastating the environment.
[00:58:58.780 --> 00:59:03.220]   So I you know, somebody says this is actually a great line.
[00:59:03.220 --> 00:59:08.140]   Carbon credits are the papal indulgence of this.
[00:59:08.140 --> 00:59:10.340]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:59:10.340 --> 00:59:13.020]   But I mean, actual trees are being planted.
[00:59:13.020 --> 00:59:14.020]   Actual money is being put in.
[00:59:14.020 --> 00:59:18.220]   I imagine you've got a recommendation by Yale what they're actually planning is Ivy.
[00:59:18.220 --> 00:59:20.740]   I've everywhere.
[00:59:20.740 --> 00:59:21.740]   God bless it.
[00:59:21.740 --> 00:59:25.980]   Mr. Jarvis, you said the USPS should have taken this this this this this this this is.
[00:59:25.980 --> 00:59:27.940]   I think all those trucks driving around.
[00:59:27.940 --> 00:59:29.660]   What about the funding who's going to pay for that?
[00:59:29.660 --> 00:59:32.420]   You think the fed they replaced they have to replace them.
[00:59:32.420 --> 00:59:34.540]   They're they're doing they're coming up to a big contract.
[00:59:34.540 --> 00:59:35.540]   Oh, okay.
[00:59:35.540 --> 00:59:37.380]   To replace all the USPS vehicles.
[00:59:37.380 --> 00:59:39.260]   Now, you're right.
[00:59:39.260 --> 00:59:45.940]   It's going to cost more to get an electric vehicle than it will a internal combustion.
[00:59:45.940 --> 00:59:46.940]   Right.
[00:59:46.940 --> 00:59:51.900]   I think when I like those vehicles, I wonder whether they pay for themselves pretty quickly.
[00:59:51.900 --> 00:59:52.900]   It's probably a push.
[00:59:52.900 --> 00:59:57.060]   Amazon has that money right here.
[00:59:57.060 --> 01:00:00.620]   They can just do it when you start talking about government.
[01:00:00.620 --> 01:00:04.740]   I just don't see it happening swiftly like that.
[01:00:04.740 --> 01:00:06.100]   Well, not with this president.
[01:00:06.100 --> 01:00:07.100]   He's done.
[01:00:07.100 --> 01:00:08.100]   Oh, New York City.
[01:00:08.100 --> 01:00:11.300]   The Postal Service has 30 electric two ton vehicles.
[01:00:11.300 --> 01:00:12.300]   Oh, 30.
[01:00:12.300 --> 01:00:17.700]   And you're also seeing mass of mass transit and some cities being converted.
[01:00:17.700 --> 01:00:19.180]   New York City just converted.
[01:00:19.180 --> 01:00:20.340]   I think what did I see?
[01:00:20.340 --> 01:00:22.860]   It was a public safety.
[01:00:22.860 --> 01:00:25.220]   NYPD is doing a lot of electric vehicles.
[01:00:25.220 --> 01:00:27.420]   So I feel like this is.
[01:00:27.420 --> 01:00:28.980]   Let's torque on them too.
[01:00:28.980 --> 01:00:29.980]   Oh, yeah.
[01:00:29.980 --> 01:00:30.980]   Yeah.
[01:00:30.980 --> 01:00:31.980]   You know what?
[01:00:31.980 --> 01:00:33.140]   There's no reason not to buy an electric car.
[01:00:33.140 --> 01:00:34.900]   They are more fun to drive.
[01:00:34.900 --> 01:00:36.380]   They're more reliable.
[01:00:36.380 --> 01:00:37.740]   They're more economical.
[01:00:37.740 --> 01:00:41.460]   I'm amazed gas vehicles have survived as long as they have.
[01:00:41.460 --> 01:00:43.460]   I have no question in my mind.
[01:00:43.460 --> 01:00:50.100]   The problem the problem for a police department is the vehicles are probably used 24 hours.
[01:00:50.100 --> 01:00:51.300]   Many of them are used 24 hours.
[01:00:51.300 --> 01:00:52.300]   Yeah.
[01:00:52.300 --> 01:00:56.580]   They're only used 8 hours, 10 hours a day.
[01:00:56.580 --> 01:00:59.260]   They could have plenty of charging time.
[01:00:59.260 --> 01:01:00.740]   Right.
[01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:03.700]   So again, am I just buying people indulgences?
[01:01:03.700 --> 01:01:06.060]   Should I just stay home?
[01:01:06.060 --> 01:01:09.420]   Oh, it's a personal choice.
[01:01:09.420 --> 01:01:14.460]   I feel a little better, at least buying carbon credits and knowing that trees will be planted.
[01:01:14.460 --> 01:01:21.980]   There's a bunch of things, projects, people in Kenya are being bought a more efficient
[01:01:21.980 --> 01:01:23.620]   stoves and generators.
[01:01:23.620 --> 01:01:26.460]   I mean, there's things you can do.
[01:01:26.460 --> 01:01:30.460]   Again, I'm the worst person to ask.
[01:01:30.460 --> 01:01:31.460]   Yeah.
[01:01:31.460 --> 01:01:32.460]   I know I am.
[01:01:32.460 --> 01:01:34.220]   Because you barbecue every day.
[01:01:34.220 --> 01:01:35.220]   Yes.
[01:01:35.220 --> 01:01:39.060]   With heat free, you know.
[01:01:39.060 --> 01:01:45.980]   So just so people know, one of these was goodtraveler.org.
[01:01:45.980 --> 01:01:49.340]   For the carbon offset?
[01:01:49.340 --> 01:01:50.340]   Yeah.
[01:01:50.340 --> 01:01:54.900]   That's the one for the crews I think that I got.
[01:01:54.900 --> 01:01:59.740]   And then the other one, I should give you both of these in case you want to do this.
[01:01:59.740 --> 01:02:03.100]   And then for the airplane, I can't remember what it was.
[01:02:03.100 --> 01:02:04.540]   I'll have to find it for you.
[01:02:04.540 --> 01:02:07.620]   For a second, I thought you were going to say that the carbon offset costs more than
[01:02:07.620 --> 01:02:08.620]   the crew's tickets.
[01:02:08.620 --> 01:02:10.540]   No, it's cheap.
[01:02:10.540 --> 01:02:11.540]   That's the interesting thing.
[01:02:11.540 --> 01:02:12.540]   Yeah.
[01:02:12.540 --> 01:02:14.340]   Maple indulgences were expensive.
[01:02:14.340 --> 01:02:17.900]   Or you're saying is roughly 1%.
[01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:18.900]   Is that what you're saying?
[01:02:18.900 --> 01:02:19.900]   Yeah.
[01:02:19.900 --> 01:02:23.540]   And then you're saying it's a little bit more expensive than the crew's.
[01:02:23.540 --> 01:02:26.180]   I mean, it's a little bit more expensive than the crew's.
[01:02:26.180 --> 01:02:29.340]   I mean, it's a little bit more expensive than the crew's.
[01:02:29.340 --> 01:02:32.140]   I mean, it's a little bit more expensive than the crew's.
[01:02:32.140 --> 01:02:35.140]   I mean, it's a little bit more expensive than the crew's.
[01:02:35.140 --> 01:02:37.980]   I mean, it's a little bit more expensive than the crew's.
[01:02:37.980 --> 01:02:45.380]   I mean, it was, I think it was 100, the total for everything that were, or by the way,
[01:02:45.380 --> 01:02:47.380]   were basically flying around the world.
[01:02:47.380 --> 01:02:48.380]   Mm-hmm.
[01:02:48.380 --> 01:02:50.260]   And I just have $700 bucks, something like that.
[01:02:50.260 --> 01:02:51.260]   Nice.
[01:02:51.260 --> 01:02:58.100]   So I just put up on the rundown, a story from earlier this year of the USPS testing vehicles
[01:02:58.100 --> 01:03:00.540]   of various types, hybrid and electric.
[01:03:00.540 --> 01:03:04.460]   They're going to buy 180,000 new mail trucks to answer your question there.
[01:03:04.460 --> 01:03:05.460]   Okay.
[01:03:05.460 --> 01:03:09.100]   A total cost of $6.3 billion over five years.
[01:03:09.100 --> 01:03:13.740]   Their target is $25,000 to $35,000 per truck.
[01:03:13.740 --> 01:03:14.740]   That's fair.
[01:03:14.740 --> 01:03:17.860]   But there is a chance now to make an impact.
[01:03:17.860 --> 01:03:18.860]   Yeah.
[01:03:18.860 --> 01:03:21.860]   So the good traveler, I'm wrong, the good traveler.
[01:03:21.860 --> 01:03:22.860]   So the next one.
[01:03:22.860 --> 01:03:27.540]   Is for airlines.
[01:03:27.540 --> 01:03:29.420]   And this one is fairly inexpensive.
[01:03:29.420 --> 01:03:35.180]   You could put in the, and by the way, you tell them, you tell them, so for every thousand
[01:03:35.180 --> 01:03:38.260]   miles of flying, it's two bucks or 400 miles of driving.
[01:03:38.260 --> 01:03:39.700]   So it's not bad.
[01:03:39.700 --> 01:03:46.700]   And you tell them what your local airport is and they try to do projects near your local
[01:03:46.700 --> 01:03:50.900]   airport, which is kind of good.
[01:03:50.900 --> 01:03:55.020]   So I think that it's kind of interesting.
[01:03:55.020 --> 01:03:58.020]   This is the one that the forestry school recommended.
[01:03:58.020 --> 01:04:02.740]   And then I'll find the other one because this is just for air travel.
[01:04:02.740 --> 01:04:06.700]   It's pretty neat having a local connection to.
[01:04:06.700 --> 01:04:07.900]   Well, it makes me feel better.
[01:04:07.900 --> 01:04:08.900]   I don't know.
[01:04:08.900 --> 01:04:11.300]   I hope it makes the world a better place.
[01:04:11.300 --> 01:04:15.640]   If things were right with the world, you should get a tax deduction for carbon credits
[01:04:15.640 --> 01:04:16.960]   to give more incentive.
[01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:18.900]   There's been more rewards and incentives.
[01:04:18.900 --> 01:04:22.080]   Besides, yeah, yes, it should be sufficient just to make up for what you're doing.
[01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:27.260]   But there could be policy decisions here that would affect how everyone operates.
[01:04:27.260 --> 01:04:28.260]   Yeah.
[01:04:28.260 --> 01:04:29.260]   Yeah.
[01:04:29.260 --> 01:04:34.180]   Mr. Jarvis, I will say I did not consider 25 to 35 K. I thought it would have been a
[01:04:34.180 --> 01:04:35.500]   little bit higher than that.
[01:04:35.500 --> 01:04:39.700]   I would have to do durability that those vehicles have to have to go.
[01:04:39.700 --> 01:04:40.860]   You know, aren't you a bolt?
[01:04:40.860 --> 01:04:41.860]   It's $30,000.
[01:04:41.860 --> 01:04:43.860]   That's a great vehicle.
[01:04:43.860 --> 01:04:45.420]   That's a great vehicle.
[01:04:45.420 --> 01:04:49.720]   Now that's expensive for what would normally be maybe an $18,000 car because the batteries
[01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:50.720]   are expensive.
[01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:52.840]   But it's going to save us a lot of money in gas.
[01:04:52.840 --> 01:04:54.800]   It's going to save us a lot of money in maintenance.
[01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:57.360]   That's $30,000 for a passenger vehicle.
[01:04:57.360 --> 01:04:58.360]   For a door passenger vehicle.
[01:04:58.360 --> 01:04:59.360]   Think about a truck.
[01:04:59.360 --> 01:05:02.520]   A mail route and what it has to deal with just for those.
[01:05:02.520 --> 01:05:05.600]   Those mail trucks look a lot like a Chevy Paul.
[01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:08.280]   They're the only thing is the steering wheels on the right.
[01:05:08.280 --> 01:05:10.200]   But other than that, there's nothing to talk about.
[01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:14.400]   I know those country roads back home can beat up a car.
[01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:18.020]   You know, there's no Rosewood dashboard in these things.
[01:05:18.020 --> 01:05:20.060]   No, no, no, I know that.
[01:05:20.060 --> 01:05:23.980]   But I'm just thinking from a maintenance standpoint, I would have assumed they would
[01:05:23.980 --> 01:05:26.020]   be a little more expensive just to.
[01:05:26.020 --> 01:05:27.020]   Well, this is bad.
[01:05:27.020 --> 01:05:28.020]   And stuff.
[01:05:28.020 --> 01:05:31.220]   But boy, those engines, electric engines are basically maintenance free.
[01:05:31.220 --> 01:05:32.220]   That's amazing.
[01:05:32.220 --> 01:05:37.360]   If you look at the difference between a gas vehicle, which is so complex and you have
[01:05:37.360 --> 01:05:39.340]   a transmission, you have a lot of other things.
[01:05:39.340 --> 01:05:41.380]   There's no transmission in electric vehicles.
[01:05:41.380 --> 01:05:44.380]   So I think maybe it's a.
[01:05:44.380 --> 01:05:45.380]   Yeah, it's.
[01:05:45.380 --> 01:05:47.380]   I mean, go ahead.
[01:05:47.380 --> 01:05:48.380]   Go ahead.
[01:05:48.380 --> 01:05:49.380]   Kevin.
[01:05:49.380 --> 01:05:54.160]   I was going to say I've had two Chevy volts, not the pre-bolt, obviously, the volts.
[01:05:54.160 --> 01:06:00.680]   And I would take it in, you know, every six to 12 months and they maybe do an oil change,
[01:06:00.680 --> 01:06:01.980]   rotate the tires.
[01:06:01.980 --> 01:06:02.980]   That's it.
[01:06:02.980 --> 01:06:03.980]   There's nothing to do.
[01:06:03.980 --> 01:06:04.980]   That's awesome.
[01:06:04.980 --> 01:06:07.820]   And the only reason they had to do the oil change is because the generator is what powers
[01:06:07.820 --> 01:06:12.220]   the battery when you're, you know, when you're at a battery juice.
[01:06:12.220 --> 01:06:13.780]   So there's nothing.
[01:06:13.780 --> 01:06:15.740]   There's nothing to them.
[01:06:15.740 --> 01:06:16.740]   Here's my question.
[01:06:16.740 --> 01:06:21.980]   Since I live in an area that gets snow and I live on a very, very steep driveway for
[01:06:21.980 --> 01:06:24.180]   that alone, I have to have four wheel drive.
[01:06:24.180 --> 01:06:27.380]   Does the torque of the electric car solve that or not?
[01:06:27.380 --> 01:06:29.680]   Well, many of them are four wheel drive.
[01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:34.540]   My Tesla was you have an engine in the front engine and back all four wheels are active.
[01:06:34.540 --> 01:06:35.540]   Mm.
[01:06:35.540 --> 01:06:36.540]   Nice.
[01:06:36.540 --> 01:06:37.540]   I don't think I make any difference.
[01:06:37.540 --> 01:06:42.100]   The biggest shoe, of course, in the cold is that lithium ion batteries, batteries really
[01:06:42.100 --> 01:06:44.140]   like to be in a very narrow range.
[01:06:44.140 --> 01:06:49.700]   But almost all these vehicles now will have heaters for the battery and cool the batteries.
[01:06:49.700 --> 01:06:51.460]   You know, they heat up when you're charging them.
[01:06:51.460 --> 01:06:58.060]   So yeah, that's part of keeping the battery reliable and long lasting.
[01:06:58.060 --> 01:06:59.180]   You know, I don't know.
[01:06:59.180 --> 01:07:00.180]   I don't know.
[01:07:00.180 --> 01:07:01.180]   You know, it's a heart.
[01:07:01.180 --> 01:07:04.900]   This is hard, but I feel like if everybody's got to do a little something, we all got to
[01:07:04.900 --> 01:07:05.900]   do a little something.
[01:07:05.900 --> 01:07:09.300]   Well, you could buy simpler computers like Chromebooks.
[01:07:09.300 --> 01:07:10.300]   Absolutely.
[01:07:10.300 --> 01:07:11.500]   Good segue.
[01:07:11.500 --> 01:07:15.260]   Let's talk about the new.
[01:07:15.260 --> 01:07:16.260]   What's it called?
[01:07:16.260 --> 01:07:17.260]   Roar word.
[01:07:17.260 --> 01:07:20.100]   Should this be a, I guess it's not changelog till it's here, right?
[01:07:20.100 --> 01:07:21.100]   Yeah.
[01:07:21.100 --> 01:07:22.100]   Right.
[01:07:22.100 --> 01:07:23.100]   No, this is not changing.
[01:07:23.100 --> 01:07:24.100]   Well, there's a bigger story than that.
[01:07:24.100 --> 01:07:27.340]   Leo, Leo, Leo, change log is just little, tiny thing.
[01:07:27.340 --> 01:07:28.340]   Oh, good.
[01:07:28.340 --> 01:07:29.340]   Okay.
[01:07:29.340 --> 01:07:30.340]   This is early.
[01:07:30.340 --> 01:07:31.340]   Shattery news.
[01:07:31.340 --> 01:07:32.340]   Hixel book the experts of all experts.
[01:07:32.340 --> 01:07:33.340]   Go.
[01:07:33.340 --> 01:07:34.340]   Let's bring here to talk about it.
[01:07:34.340 --> 01:07:35.340]   Well, we should go to big story.
[01:07:35.340 --> 01:07:38.660]   We should go to aboutchromebooks.com and read all about it, right, Kirsten?
[01:07:38.660 --> 01:07:40.900]   Yeah, at least that's where I am.
[01:07:40.900 --> 01:07:41.900]   Yeah.
[01:07:41.900 --> 01:07:45.260]   Tell us about it, Mr. T. So do we know?
[01:07:45.260 --> 01:07:48.380]   Well, we don't, I wouldn't say we know anything.
[01:07:48.380 --> 01:07:52.940]   No, we just wrote an article, your thoughts about the leaks, which I think is.
[01:07:52.940 --> 01:07:57.260]   Yes, we have leaks from nine to five Google and kudos to them.
[01:07:57.260 --> 01:08:02.940]   They claim to have good sourcing and I have a lot of data that backs up what they've said
[01:08:02.940 --> 01:08:05.380]   and I have no data to dispute what they've said.
[01:08:05.380 --> 01:08:12.620]   So I'm going to go with assuming this is what Google will announce on October 15th.
[01:08:12.620 --> 01:08:16.700]   The image that they presented is the same image that I presented back in May.
[01:08:16.700 --> 01:08:20.980]   I mean, I saw this device and it, Jeff, I don't think you're going to be happy.
[01:08:20.980 --> 01:08:22.500]   I almost want to not talk about it.
[01:08:22.500 --> 01:08:26.780]   I almost want to start by saying what Jeff do you want in the next pixel book?
[01:08:26.780 --> 01:08:27.780]   I'm kind of curious.
[01:08:27.780 --> 01:08:32.780]   I want the same one I have just newer and LTE, right?
[01:08:32.780 --> 01:08:33.780]   I'd like to see.
[01:08:33.780 --> 01:08:34.780]   Right.
[01:08:34.780 --> 01:08:38.580]   And I didn't think I would be using the, what do you call it?
[01:08:38.580 --> 01:08:41.860]   You know, roll around design to an equivalent on tablet mode.
[01:08:41.860 --> 01:08:42.860]   Yeah, I use it.
[01:08:42.860 --> 01:08:45.740]   I don't want to travel using up carbon on planes.
[01:08:45.740 --> 01:08:46.740]   I watch movies.
[01:08:46.740 --> 01:08:50.740]   You need to buy some credits, my friend, the good traveler.com.
[01:08:50.740 --> 01:08:53.300]   Is this a little better about it?
[01:08:53.300 --> 01:08:57.540]   Well, based on what we, what we know, Jeff, you won't be doing that on a plane because
[01:08:57.540 --> 01:08:58.940]   this is going to be a clamshell.
[01:08:58.940 --> 01:09:01.060]   The pixel book go is the name of this.
[01:09:01.060 --> 01:09:02.060]   I am.
[01:09:02.060 --> 01:09:04.140]   No flipping over into tablet mode.
[01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:06.380]   No pen support either apparently.
[01:09:06.380 --> 01:09:09.300]   And that's a, I bought the pen.
[01:09:09.300 --> 01:09:11.140]   I've never ever used my pen either.
[01:09:11.140 --> 01:09:12.140]   Yep.
[01:09:12.140 --> 01:09:13.140]   That's fine.
[01:09:13.140 --> 01:09:14.820]   Samsung still sells a Chromebook with pen.
[01:09:14.820 --> 01:09:16.380]   You can still go with the same.
[01:09:16.380 --> 01:09:17.380]   Yeah.
[01:09:17.380 --> 01:09:18.380]   Yeah.
[01:09:18.380 --> 01:09:21.140]   My, my Acer Chromebook spin 13 as a, as a pen, not as good, but it works.
[01:09:21.140 --> 01:09:23.260]   So that's the question.
[01:09:23.260 --> 01:09:29.420]   Pixel books have been the past been the highest priced of all Chromebooks.
[01:09:29.420 --> 01:09:30.660]   And highest end.
[01:09:30.660 --> 01:09:31.660]   And highest end.
[01:09:31.660 --> 01:09:32.660]   Oh, yeah.
[01:09:32.660 --> 01:09:34.460]   And in this sounds like it's not as high end.
[01:09:34.460 --> 01:09:40.440]   You think, well, M3, I5 or I7, this is according to nine to five Google, eight or 16 gigs of
[01:09:40.440 --> 01:09:41.440]   RAM.
[01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:43.380]   That's very high end.
[01:09:43.380 --> 01:09:47.860]   Storage options of 64, 128 and 256 gigs.
[01:09:47.860 --> 01:09:52.020]   And they say EMMC based, which is, is that's the good one, right?
[01:09:52.020 --> 01:09:53.020]   That's the good solace.
[01:09:53.020 --> 01:09:56.860]   You know, you want SSD not EMC.
[01:09:56.860 --> 01:09:57.860]   Okay.
[01:09:57.860 --> 01:09:58.860]   Right.
[01:09:58.860 --> 01:09:59.860]   Yeah, essentially.
[01:09:59.860 --> 01:10:04.660]   They're C ports, but they're USB, of course, because Chromebook doesn't support Thunderbolt.
[01:10:04.660 --> 01:10:05.660]   What?
[01:10:05.660 --> 01:10:07.220]   Well, it shouldn't.
[01:10:07.220 --> 01:10:08.220]   Why not?
[01:10:08.220 --> 01:10:11.980]   It sees a real standard Thunderbolt's Apple crap.
[01:10:11.980 --> 01:10:13.980]   Oh my God.
[01:10:13.980 --> 01:10:14.980]   There we go.
[01:10:14.980 --> 01:10:18.060]   Who wants to take this one?
[01:10:18.060 --> 01:10:21.460]   No, Thunderbolt is not Apple crap.
[01:10:21.460 --> 01:10:23.820]   It's a standard and it's actually a great standard.
[01:10:23.820 --> 01:10:24.820]   It's on your PC.
[01:10:24.820 --> 01:10:26.820]   It's on most PCs these days.
[01:10:26.820 --> 01:10:30.940]   In fact, the only people who don't seem to like it very much besides Google is oddly
[01:10:30.940 --> 01:10:31.940]   enough.
[01:10:31.940 --> 01:10:35.860]   Microsoft, which is refused to put it on its surface devices, but it is really great.
[01:10:35.860 --> 01:10:36.860]   It's super fast.
[01:10:36.860 --> 01:10:38.900]   It's supported by Windows.
[01:10:38.900 --> 01:10:40.620]   Macintosh supports it.
[01:10:40.620 --> 01:10:43.700]   Linux supports it now, but Chrome OS does not.
[01:10:43.700 --> 01:10:44.700]   Not that you need it.
[01:10:44.700 --> 01:10:52.700]   I mean, storage has never been the Cinequa-Nultra of the, I don't know what that even means.
[01:10:52.700 --> 01:10:53.700]   I'm trying to break it down.
[01:10:53.700 --> 01:10:54.700]   I was like, that sounds.
[01:10:54.700 --> 01:10:55.700]   It sounds.
[01:10:55.700 --> 01:11:03.580]   It's one known, it's a little Latin, without which nothing for the Chrome OS.
[01:11:03.580 --> 01:11:07.540]   But because you don't have to do in storage, you're supposed to do everything with the
[01:11:07.540 --> 01:11:08.540]   cloud.
[01:11:08.540 --> 01:11:12.580]   Yeah, you don't store large files often and move them around, I guess is probably the
[01:11:12.580 --> 01:11:14.420]   more accurate thing to say.
[01:11:14.420 --> 01:11:19.980]   So let's, let's, if we can go back to the processors because Google has learned from
[01:11:19.980 --> 01:11:25.580]   the Celeron debacle of the Pixel Slate that people don't want that, especially if it's
[01:11:25.580 --> 01:11:30.860]   going to have a 1080p or 4K display that it's going to be driving.
[01:11:30.860 --> 01:11:36.700]   And that's the options that you're going to see here according to what we, what we know.
[01:11:36.700 --> 01:11:45.820]   The processors are the same M3i5i7 as the Pixel Slate, meaning they are the 8th gen Y series
[01:11:45.820 --> 01:11:51.020]   chips, which are low powered, not a big upgrade from what you have today, Jeff.
[01:11:51.020 --> 01:11:52.500]   I hate to say it.
[01:11:52.500 --> 01:11:54.460]   It's just a one generation upgrade.
[01:11:54.460 --> 01:11:57.780]   And to be honest, it's almost a generation behind at this point because we now have 9th
[01:11:57.780 --> 01:11:58.980]   and 10th gen.
[01:11:58.980 --> 01:11:59.980]   It's really nice.
[01:11:59.980 --> 01:12:00.980]   Yeah.
[01:12:00.980 --> 01:12:01.980]   Exactly.
[01:12:01.980 --> 01:12:06.100]   And the reason, and I said this a couple months ago, the reason I did not wait for Pixel Slate
[01:12:06.100 --> 01:12:12.980]   and drop big money on this Acer Chromebook Spin with 16 gig of RAM is because it uses
[01:12:12.980 --> 01:12:17.580]   the U series Intel processors, which can run.
[01:12:17.580 --> 01:12:21.180]   They're more, yes, it's less of a mobile device.
[01:12:21.180 --> 01:12:25.020]   You need a fan for that, which obviously the Pixel Slate didn't, and I don't think the
[01:12:25.020 --> 01:12:27.020]   Pixel will go, will need a fan.
[01:12:27.020 --> 01:12:28.780]   But it can run longer, hotter.
[01:12:28.780 --> 01:12:30.660]   It can run longer under load.
[01:12:30.660 --> 01:12:32.500]   So I can do Android Studio on this device.
[01:12:32.500 --> 01:12:38.420]   I can do all my, uh, intelligent, my Python, my Java, everything else because it has the
[01:12:38.420 --> 01:12:40.500]   next level up processor.
[01:12:40.500 --> 01:12:43.180]   These processors were available on the Pixel Slate a year ago.
[01:12:43.180 --> 01:12:48.860]   If the Pixelbook ghosts leak specs are correct, Google could release this device a year ago.
[01:12:48.860 --> 01:12:50.900]   That's what's got me, or a cray now.
[01:12:50.900 --> 01:12:58.380]   Is there any evidence that these processors are better battery wise than the 9th gen?
[01:12:58.380 --> 01:13:02.020]   Is that the only reason they would stick around with it?
[01:13:02.020 --> 01:13:03.740]   You know, and it's a great question.
[01:13:03.740 --> 01:13:05.260]   I don't think it has anything to do with battery.
[01:13:05.260 --> 01:13:07.660]   I think it has to do with purchasing power.
[01:13:07.660 --> 01:13:13.940]   Dell, HP, Lenovo, they can get huge bulk discounts on the 9th and 10th gen Intel chips,
[01:13:13.940 --> 01:13:14.940]   right?
[01:13:14.940 --> 01:13:19.140]   Google doesn't make a lot of process, or computers with processors in them.
[01:13:19.140 --> 01:13:22.140]   They don't have that kind of bulk pull.
[01:13:22.140 --> 01:13:26.580]   So it's easier for them to just use the last year's chips, save some money, hopefully not
[01:13:26.580 --> 01:13:31.020]   charge us a lot, but the rumor is these will be priced like the Pixel Slate.
[01:13:31.020 --> 01:13:35.700]   I just, I don't know who these are going to be for, who this Pixelbook GO is for.
[01:13:35.700 --> 01:13:40.580]   I just don't get it because Leo, as you said, it's always been the high end high price model.
[01:13:40.580 --> 01:13:45.220]   Now you've got, you've got higher priced and high, well, lower priced, higher spec models
[01:13:45.220 --> 01:13:48.580]   from Acer, Lenovo, Dell, HP.
[01:13:48.580 --> 01:13:50.460]   So where does this fit in?
[01:13:50.460 --> 01:13:52.460]   I don't see it.
[01:13:52.460 --> 01:13:55.060]   Why does Google do Chromebooks?
[01:13:55.060 --> 01:13:57.700]   They need to do one to show what can be done.
[01:13:57.700 --> 01:13:58.700]   Is it a reference design?
[01:13:58.700 --> 01:13:59.700]   Right, because one that was dead.
[01:13:59.700 --> 01:14:02.420]   Is it the high end that no one else will make?
[01:14:02.420 --> 01:14:04.620]   Is it for their own staff?
[01:14:04.620 --> 01:14:10.620]   Why, I mean, clearly there's, what's nice this year compared to earlier years, perhaps,
[01:14:10.620 --> 01:14:17.460]   is there's a very nice range of Chromebooks available from 200 bucks to 1000 brands.
[01:14:17.460 --> 01:14:20.660]   So Google doesn't need to prove anything anymore.
[01:14:20.660 --> 01:14:21.660]   Right.
[01:14:21.660 --> 01:14:24.020]   So why do they make a Chromebook?
[01:14:24.020 --> 01:14:25.260]   I think it's all the above.
[01:14:25.260 --> 01:14:28.660]   I think it's a little bit of each item you just mentioned.
[01:14:28.660 --> 01:14:30.260]   It's to show what can be done.
[01:14:30.260 --> 01:14:32.980]   It's to show something unique.
[01:14:32.980 --> 01:14:37.660]   Like the Google, made by Google Chromebooks, have a dedicated assistant button, whereas
[01:14:37.660 --> 01:14:39.900]   none of the others have that, for example.
[01:14:39.900 --> 01:14:41.900]   Actually, that's changing incidentally.
[01:14:41.900 --> 01:14:42.900]   It is.
[01:14:42.900 --> 01:14:43.900]   It is.
[01:14:43.900 --> 01:14:48.260]   In fact, it changed effectively today because Chrome OS 77 hasn't been announced, but it's
[01:14:48.260 --> 01:14:49.900]   showing up on Chromebooks.
[01:14:49.900 --> 01:14:55.380]   And if you enable it and hit your search A button, the assistant will actually pop up
[01:14:55.380 --> 01:14:56.780]   for it, which is fantastic.
[01:14:56.780 --> 01:14:57.780]   Yes.
[01:14:57.780 --> 01:14:58.780]   Yeah.
[01:14:58.780 --> 01:15:01.580]   So still not a dedicated search button, although it can only be a matter of time before companies
[01:15:01.580 --> 01:15:03.580]   start putting those out.
[01:15:03.580 --> 01:15:04.580]   Yeah.
[01:15:04.580 --> 01:15:07.260]   I mean, voice button, not search.
[01:15:07.260 --> 01:15:08.260]   There is search.
[01:15:08.260 --> 01:15:12.100]   I, you know, there was a reason for Google to make its own Chromebooks before.
[01:15:12.100 --> 01:15:14.660]   Now I see less of a reason because of what you just said.
[01:15:14.660 --> 01:15:18.060]   There are a range of Chromebooks from $200,000 to $1,000.
[01:15:18.060 --> 01:15:23.020]   I paid $819 for this Chromebook, which is far more powerful than what's expected in the
[01:15:23.020 --> 01:15:29.220]   Pixelbook Go and probably less, less, less than the cost of the Pixelbook Go.
[01:15:29.220 --> 01:15:31.100]   So I just don't know.
[01:15:31.100 --> 01:15:37.100]   I almost feel like the Pixel slate didn't take off the way they hoped and they scaled
[01:15:37.100 --> 01:15:41.220]   the next Pixelbook back and just said, let's just get this out there.
[01:15:41.220 --> 01:15:42.500]   I don't know that for sure.
[01:15:42.500 --> 01:15:43.500]   It's just speculation.
[01:15:43.500 --> 01:15:44.500]   Why bother?
[01:15:44.500 --> 01:15:46.260]   Because you say there are good machines.
[01:15:46.260 --> 01:15:48.500]   It's just doesn't make a lot of sense.
[01:15:48.500 --> 01:15:54.580]   So if I don't want a fan and I'm not doing quite the heavy stuff you're doing, but I've
[01:15:54.580 --> 01:15:58.380]   loved my Pixelbook that I have, what would you recommend?
[01:15:58.380 --> 01:15:59.380]   Acer.
[01:15:59.380 --> 01:16:02.660]   Well, this, well, I mean, I like my Acer.
[01:16:02.660 --> 01:16:06.220]   It's not quite as high quality of a display and it does have a fan.
[01:16:06.220 --> 01:16:07.860]   So that's out for you, Jeff.
[01:16:07.860 --> 01:16:10.220]   What's the best display out there?
[01:16:10.220 --> 01:16:16.060]   Because Lenovo has, Lenovo's got the Yoga Chromebook C630 with a 4K option.
[01:16:16.060 --> 01:16:17.060]   Nice.
[01:16:17.060 --> 01:16:19.980]   That by the way, the rumor is this Go will also have a 4K option.
[01:16:19.980 --> 01:16:21.580]   Yes, it will have an option.
[01:16:21.580 --> 01:16:23.260]   But, but, but, but, that kills battery life.
[01:16:23.260 --> 01:16:24.260]   I should point out.
[01:16:24.260 --> 01:16:25.900]   But will those ships push it?
[01:16:25.900 --> 01:16:26.900]   Oh, yeah.
[01:16:26.900 --> 01:16:28.620]   Yes, because, yeah, it's the Intel UH-600.
[01:16:28.620 --> 01:16:31.020]   It's just a monoship that does the work.
[01:16:31.020 --> 01:16:32.020]   Oh, it is.
[01:16:32.020 --> 01:16:33.020]   Yeah.
[01:16:33.020 --> 01:16:34.020]   It's fine.
[01:16:34.020 --> 01:16:37.500]   The Lenovo with the 4K, I've seen it on sale with the U-series processor, the better
[01:16:37.500 --> 01:16:43.220]   processor, I think for 619, 620.
[01:16:43.220 --> 01:16:44.220]   Wow.
[01:16:44.220 --> 01:16:45.140]   I mean, that's, that's a sale price.
[01:16:45.140 --> 01:16:47.300]   The regular price is like 899.
[01:16:47.300 --> 01:16:50.260]   But it seems to go on sale like every two weeks, Jeff.
[01:16:50.260 --> 01:16:52.540]   White, promising.
[01:16:52.540 --> 01:16:53.540]   That is not that.
[01:16:53.540 --> 01:16:55.580]   That's a 15.4 inch display.
[01:16:55.580 --> 01:16:56.580]   Oh.
[01:16:56.580 --> 01:16:57.580]   So, yeah.
[01:16:57.580 --> 01:16:58.580]   So that's not light.
[01:16:58.580 --> 01:16:59.820]   The, the Go, see, that's the thing.
[01:16:59.820 --> 01:17:00.820]   What's with this Go name?
[01:17:00.820 --> 01:17:02.220]   That's the other thing.
[01:17:02.220 --> 01:17:05.700]   Maybe this is made, maybe more of plastic instead of metal like the Pixelbook.
[01:17:05.700 --> 01:17:06.700]   Oh, wow.
[01:17:06.700 --> 01:17:07.700]   It's lighter.
[01:17:07.700 --> 01:17:10.460]   It's, you know, so maybe that's your thing.
[01:17:10.460 --> 01:17:16.100]   I don't, I don't know until they announce it, but, you know, if you want a 4K display
[01:17:16.100 --> 01:17:17.900]   and a 13 inch screen and-
[01:17:17.900 --> 01:17:19.300]   No, no, I don't need a 4K.
[01:17:19.300 --> 01:17:20.780]   I mean, I love the machine I have now.
[01:17:20.780 --> 01:17:23.580]   It's just that it's, it's coming to the end of this useful life and I'm going to have
[01:17:23.580 --> 01:17:25.340]   to buy something long in the two.
[01:17:25.340 --> 01:17:26.340]   Is it though?
[01:17:26.340 --> 01:17:28.460]   I mean, it's, it's acting the screen.
[01:17:28.460 --> 01:17:29.900]   Well, sometimes flash black.
[01:17:29.900 --> 01:17:31.700]   It's, I'm afraid it's going to die on me.
[01:17:31.700 --> 01:17:32.700]   Oh, that's okay.
[01:17:32.700 --> 01:17:33.700]   Okay.
[01:17:33.700 --> 01:17:34.700]   Guys going to say software update.
[01:17:34.700 --> 01:17:35.700]   Well, that should be okay for six years.
[01:17:35.700 --> 01:17:39.420]   It's about the thing Leo's complained about, the bezels.
[01:17:39.420 --> 01:17:43.060]   So the rumor is about how big the bezels are on the go.
[01:17:43.060 --> 01:17:48.100]   Honestly, from what we've seen so far, it looks very much like a Pixel Slate screen
[01:17:48.100 --> 01:17:50.900]   attached to a keyboard, right?
[01:17:50.900 --> 01:17:53.100]   So, and those bezels are okay.
[01:17:53.100 --> 01:17:54.100]   They're not great.
[01:17:54.100 --> 01:17:55.100]   They're average.
[01:17:55.100 --> 01:17:56.100]   Yeah.
[01:17:56.100 --> 01:17:57.100]   Yeah.
[01:17:57.100 --> 01:17:59.260]   Actually, I wouldn't do anything to you.
[01:17:59.260 --> 01:18:06.940]   Yeah, well, that's actually a good point and I think it's 550 for the mod for the base
[01:18:06.940 --> 01:18:10.860]   model with the keyboard, which is ridiculous.
[01:18:10.860 --> 01:18:12.420]   I still like that device.
[01:18:12.420 --> 01:18:14.140]   It got a bad rap.
[01:18:14.140 --> 01:18:19.300]   Yes, for good reason when it launched back in November, but software updates have come
[01:18:19.300 --> 01:18:22.140]   along and made that thing much, much better.
[01:18:22.140 --> 01:18:29.100]   That's what I was using for my comps like classes until I got the, the, the, so.
[01:18:29.100 --> 01:18:33.380]   You know, for 550 bucks, I'd take the chance.
[01:18:33.380 --> 01:18:35.380]   That's just me.
[01:18:35.380 --> 01:18:41.580]   We were talking about you actually on Windows weekly because you are able to use a Chromebook,
[01:18:41.580 --> 01:18:42.580]   get programming done.
[01:18:42.580 --> 01:18:46.140]   Do you use Android Studio or what do you use?
[01:18:46.140 --> 01:18:48.540]   I use Android Studio for my own things.
[01:18:48.540 --> 01:18:54.260]   I use IntelliJ idea for classwork, a range of tools.
[01:18:54.260 --> 01:18:56.940]   And you do that by turning on Linux on your Chromebook.
[01:18:56.940 --> 01:18:57.940]   Oh, yeah.
[01:18:57.940 --> 01:18:58.940]   Yep.
[01:18:58.940 --> 01:19:04.620]   No, I don't, I know Jeff does not want to turn on Linux, but Android store probably, right?
[01:19:04.620 --> 01:19:07.580]   Do all modern Chromebooks now support Linux and Android stores?
[01:19:07.580 --> 01:19:11.460]   Is that because it used to be some hardware didn't, some hardware didn't.
[01:19:11.460 --> 01:19:12.460]   Correct.
[01:19:12.460 --> 01:19:13.460]   Correct.
[01:19:13.460 --> 01:19:18.700]   At Google, I.O. Google had said that all new Chromebooks going forward would have Christina
[01:19:18.700 --> 01:19:20.100]   or Linux support.
[01:19:20.100 --> 01:19:21.100]   Yes.
[01:19:21.100 --> 01:19:24.820]   And Android, the Google Play store has been standard on all new Chromebooks for about
[01:19:24.820 --> 01:19:25.820]   two years.
[01:19:25.820 --> 01:19:26.820]   Okay.
[01:19:26.820 --> 01:19:30.060]   Do you think the lakes are credible?
[01:19:30.060 --> 01:19:31.060]   I do.
[01:19:31.060 --> 01:19:32.060]   Okay.
[01:19:32.060 --> 01:19:33.060]   I do.
[01:19:33.060 --> 01:19:34.060]   And you know what?
[01:19:34.060 --> 01:19:37.220]   Some people are saying maybe go, in fact, some of my readers said this and it's very
[01:19:37.220 --> 01:19:38.620]   astute to them.
[01:19:38.620 --> 01:19:45.380]   The go name could be because it's a lower end model, just like the Android go phones.
[01:19:45.380 --> 01:19:51.900]   But what refutes that to me is a 4K display and high end amounts of storage.
[01:19:51.900 --> 01:19:54.180]   So I don't know about that.
[01:19:54.180 --> 01:19:57.860]   Some people are saying maybe there's a second better one coming out, but I've seen no evidence
[01:19:57.860 --> 01:19:59.140]   with that.
[01:19:59.140 --> 01:20:04.340]   So I tuned into Windows Weekly late.
[01:20:04.340 --> 01:20:07.380]   Was I hearing Paul Thorett actually praise Chromebooks?
[01:20:07.380 --> 01:20:08.380]   Yeah.
[01:20:08.380 --> 01:20:09.380]   Yeah.
[01:20:09.380 --> 01:20:11.300]   He said he uses it for like the second half of his day.
[01:20:11.300 --> 01:20:13.500]   He has a whole series at Thorett.com.
[01:20:13.500 --> 01:20:15.420]   It's unfortunately have to be a premium subscriber.
[01:20:15.420 --> 01:20:19.100]   I am, but he has a whole series on using a Chromebook.
[01:20:19.100 --> 01:20:20.100]   It's a great series.
[01:20:20.100 --> 01:20:21.100]   It is.
[01:20:21.100 --> 01:20:22.100]   It's really good.
[01:20:22.100 --> 01:20:23.100]   Yeah.
[01:20:23.100 --> 01:20:26.220]   But it's not a props to Paul because even though he's a Windows journalist and covers
[01:20:26.220 --> 01:20:31.340]   Windows, he has always been open to other stuff.
[01:20:31.340 --> 01:20:33.060]   And he's like us.
[01:20:33.060 --> 01:20:34.060]   He's a geek.
[01:20:34.060 --> 01:20:38.380]   He doesn't let his biases get or his not even biases.
[01:20:38.380 --> 01:20:44.020]   He doesn't let his professional interests get in the way of his wide ranging coverage.
[01:20:44.020 --> 01:20:45.020]   And I think it's great.
[01:20:45.020 --> 01:20:46.860]   I think it's really good.
[01:20:46.860 --> 01:20:47.860]   Yeah.
[01:20:47.860 --> 01:20:52.460]   Hey, big, big deal, which we'll talk about in just a second.
[01:20:52.460 --> 01:20:53.460]   Google.
[01:20:53.460 --> 01:20:56.100]   Mate, no, not you Google outstanding.
[01:20:56.100 --> 01:20:59.100]   Not that Google.
[01:20:59.100 --> 01:21:00.100]   Not that Google.
[01:21:00.100 --> 01:21:03.860]   The other Google may have made a massive computing breakthrough.
[01:21:03.860 --> 01:21:08.220]   We'll talk about it in just a minute, but first a word from our sponsor.
[01:21:08.220 --> 01:21:11.900]   This episode of this week in Google is brought to you by PayPal credit.
[01:21:11.900 --> 01:21:15.820]   Use PayPal credit for any purchases you want to make big or small.
[01:21:15.820 --> 01:21:20.020]   You might have a trip you want to take flights, car rentals, hotels, tickets, etc.
[01:21:20.020 --> 01:21:23.620]   Or a new computer, sound system, monitor phone you've been wanting to buy.
[01:21:23.620 --> 01:21:26.980]   Or for the sneaker heads out there, that seems there's always a new shoe that comes
[01:21:26.980 --> 01:21:28.660]   out you just have to have.
[01:21:28.660 --> 01:21:33.980]   You can buy what you want today and pay overtime with PayPal credit and PayPal credit off for
[01:21:33.980 --> 01:21:38.300]   six months special financing on purchases of $99 or more.
[01:21:38.300 --> 01:21:39.860]   Some great things about PayPal credit.
[01:21:39.860 --> 01:21:44.300]   It's a digital reusable credit line built into your account with PayPal.
[01:21:44.300 --> 01:21:45.580]   No card needed.
[01:21:45.580 --> 01:21:49.260]   It's accepted at millions of online stores where PayPal is accepted.
[01:21:49.260 --> 01:21:53.940]   You can use PayPal credit with your existing account with PayPal and check out is seamless.
[01:21:53.940 --> 01:21:56.780]   If you don't have an account with PayPal, you can open one for free.
[01:21:56.780 --> 01:22:01.020]   PayPal credit is great for large expenses or when something unexpected comes up.
[01:22:01.020 --> 01:22:06.060]   Applying is easy just to answer a few quick questions and get a credit decision in seconds.
[01:22:06.060 --> 01:22:10.420]   Enjoy six months special financing on purchases of $99 or more.
[01:22:10.420 --> 01:22:15.020]   Go to paypal.com/twit to learn more and apply for PayPal credit.
[01:22:15.020 --> 01:22:17.740]   Minimum monthly payments required subject to credit approval.
[01:22:17.740 --> 01:22:21.140]   It's paypal.com/twit.
[01:22:21.140 --> 01:22:24.300]   Quantum supremacy.
[01:22:24.300 --> 01:22:25.580]   I just love the phrase.
[01:22:25.580 --> 01:22:28.860]   I, for one, welcome my new Quantum Supremacy Master.
[01:22:28.860 --> 01:22:31.100]   For years we've been talking about quantum computing.
[01:22:31.100 --> 01:22:37.100]   I have, I admit for years, poo-pooed the notion of a working quantum computer.
[01:22:37.100 --> 01:22:42.740]   People were up in arms about quantum computing saying we've got to find a new form of cryptography
[01:22:42.740 --> 01:22:49.740]   because a quantum computer will be so much faster than an existing von Neumann machine
[01:22:49.740 --> 01:22:55.260]   that none of our crypto will work.
[01:22:55.260 --> 01:22:58.820]   Google's been doing some work in secret.
[01:22:58.820 --> 01:23:04.220]   NASA, which was a partner in this work, inadvertently published a paper which they almost immediately
[01:23:04.220 --> 01:23:10.540]   unpublished but before too long people were able to get a copy of it.
[01:23:10.540 --> 01:23:16.660]   The Google research paper was titled Quantum Supremacy using a programmable superconducting
[01:23:16.660 --> 01:23:18.740]   processor.
[01:23:18.740 --> 01:23:23.860]   Quantum supremacy is a term used by quantum computing folks.
[01:23:23.860 --> 01:23:29.860]   In fact, I'll point you to a really good and completely impenetrable blog post by the
[01:23:29.860 --> 01:23:34.140]   guy who coined the term, Scott Aronson.
[01:23:34.140 --> 01:23:36.180]   It's actually really great.
[01:23:36.180 --> 01:23:40.580]   Scott's Supreme Quantum Supremacy FAQ.
[01:23:40.580 --> 01:23:44.900]   He talks about what quantum supremacy is but I will attempt in my own way to define it.
[01:23:44.900 --> 01:23:53.060]   It is essentially a proof that quantum computing works if a quantum computer can do something
[01:23:53.060 --> 01:23:59.340]   significantly faster than a Turing machine can do, then that's quantum supremacy.
[01:23:59.340 --> 01:24:07.300]   In fact, in this paper it was asserted that the Google quantum computer was able to solve
[01:24:07.300 --> 01:24:14.700]   a problem 50,000 times faster than the world's fastest traditional supercomputer.
[01:24:14.700 --> 01:24:16.620]   That's amazing.
[01:24:16.620 --> 01:24:19.260]   It's not a task you would want.
[01:24:19.260 --> 01:24:24.540]   It's not solving a problem that anyone cares about but it's merely a demonstration that
[01:24:24.540 --> 01:24:26.300]   you could do it.
[01:24:26.300 --> 01:24:33.180]   It's kind of a random number thing but it was able to do it according to the paper in three
[01:24:33.180 --> 01:24:39.180]   minutes and 20 seconds what would take the world's fastest supercomputer summit 10,000
[01:24:39.180 --> 01:24:43.260]   years.
[01:24:43.260 --> 01:24:52.900]   If you read the blog by Scott Aronson you'll realize that it's more complicated than that.
[01:24:52.900 --> 01:24:57.300]   If you really care about quantum supremacy it's probably worth reading this.
[01:24:57.300 --> 01:25:03.660]   He basically confirms the post saying, "Yeah, I was involved in this.
[01:25:03.660 --> 01:25:06.220]   I've been trying not to tell anybody for a long time.
[01:25:06.220 --> 01:25:07.420]   It's been a big secret."
[01:25:07.420 --> 01:25:13.420]   Google pulled the article because they want to make a big splash when they announce it.
[01:25:13.420 --> 01:25:18.260]   Probably would behoove everybody to understand a little bit more about what this means.
[01:25:18.260 --> 01:25:22.740]   It does not mean that a quantum computer is around the corner.
[01:25:22.740 --> 01:25:27.180]   By the way, he says, "I did not create the quantum supremacy phrase.
[01:25:27.180 --> 01:25:31.620]   It was coined by John Preskel in 2012."
[01:25:31.620 --> 01:25:34.500]   He's widely considered the guy who first...
[01:25:34.500 --> 01:25:38.220]   Anyway, that establishes his Bonafide for this article.
[01:25:38.220 --> 01:25:43.340]   He talks about what the problem solved was likely to be and what it means and it doesn't
[01:25:43.340 --> 01:25:46.260]   mean a lot of things.
[01:25:46.260 --> 01:25:48.100]   This is important.
[01:25:48.100 --> 01:25:53.180]   It might in fact be the kind of thing that you'll look back and say, "Oh, I remember."
[01:25:53.180 --> 01:25:56.420]   Back in 2019, when we first...
[01:25:56.420 --> 01:26:00.180]   He likens it, Aaron's likens it to Kitty Hawk.
[01:26:00.180 --> 01:26:06.300]   The first flight of the Wright brothers, which by the way didn't become public for months,
[01:26:06.300 --> 01:26:10.900]   certainly didn't imply that we'd be able to fly across the country or across around the
[01:26:10.900 --> 01:26:12.500]   world in a jare plane.
[01:26:12.500 --> 01:26:13.500]   It was just the highest.
[01:26:13.500 --> 01:26:17.820]   But it was the first time humans flew.
[01:26:17.820 --> 01:26:20.420]   For any appreciable distance.
[01:26:20.420 --> 01:26:22.060]   That's kind of what this is.
[01:26:22.060 --> 01:26:23.060]   So...
[01:26:23.060 --> 01:26:27.460]   So what does it mean to Bitcoin?
[01:26:27.460 --> 01:26:30.140]   Well, that's an interesting question.
[01:26:30.140 --> 01:26:31.140]   Some people brought this up.
[01:26:31.140 --> 01:26:33.300]   I don't know if it means anything for Bitcoin.
[01:26:33.300 --> 01:26:41.140]   It would mean maybe if you could create a Bitcoin miner out of a quantum computer, which
[01:26:41.140 --> 01:26:43.500]   by the way, that's years and years off.
[01:26:43.500 --> 01:26:45.740]   You could perhaps make a semani.
[01:26:45.740 --> 01:26:47.580]   But that's not likely.
[01:26:47.580 --> 01:26:50.820]   These quantum computers have to be super cooled.
[01:26:50.820 --> 01:26:53.220]   They're very expensive to run.
[01:26:53.220 --> 01:26:58.140]   They're very difficult to create and they're incredibly unstable.
[01:26:58.140 --> 01:27:00.700]   So it's not a practical solution.
[01:27:00.700 --> 01:27:02.220]   Sounds like the perfect computer.
[01:27:02.220 --> 01:27:03.220]   Yeah.
[01:27:03.220 --> 01:27:04.220]   Just what you want.
[01:27:04.220 --> 01:27:10.380]   If you think you're an evil rich monster, what are you doing?
[01:27:10.380 --> 01:27:11.380]   Nothing.
[01:27:11.380 --> 01:27:12.380]   It doesn't mean anything.
[01:27:12.380 --> 01:27:16.060]   Not worth the trouble even for even evil rich monsters.
[01:27:16.060 --> 01:27:21.500]   Unless you've got the research means of NASA and Google.
[01:27:21.500 --> 01:27:22.500]   No.
[01:27:22.500 --> 01:27:24.140]   But it's fascinating.
[01:27:24.140 --> 01:27:27.100]   And anybody who watches our shows and his interest in this kind of stuff probably really
[01:27:27.100 --> 01:27:28.620]   should read Scott Aronson's blog.
[01:27:28.620 --> 01:27:31.820]   His blog is scottaronson.com.
[01:27:31.820 --> 01:27:35.500]   S-C-O-T-T-A-A-R-O-N-S-O-N.com.
[01:27:35.500 --> 01:27:39.180]   But you could also search for quantum supremacy FAQ.
[01:27:39.180 --> 01:27:40.580]   You'd probably find it already done that.
[01:27:40.580 --> 01:27:44.300]   Yeah, I doubt there's more than one.
[01:27:44.300 --> 01:27:47.580]   I think victory for Google in a right to be forgotten case.
[01:27:47.580 --> 01:27:51.340]   I'm sure Jeff, you thought, well, there's some good news out there.
[01:27:51.340 --> 01:27:52.780]   This was good news this week.
[01:27:52.780 --> 01:27:55.700]   Yeah, I mean, it's not 100% good news, but it's good news all around.
[01:27:55.700 --> 01:27:58.900]   There were two big right to be forgotten cases.
[01:27:58.900 --> 01:28:06.260]   But the most visible one was countries trying to say that we can demand that you take down
[01:28:06.260 --> 01:28:10.140]   stuff worldwide, which is to say that we would end up with the lowest common denominator
[01:28:10.140 --> 01:28:16.980]   internet, if it's Turkey or Iran or Hungary or Pick Your Country You Don't Like for what
[01:28:16.980 --> 01:28:20.740]   they're doing these days in an authoritarian government could demand that things be taken
[01:28:20.740 --> 01:28:21.740]   down around the world.
[01:28:21.740 --> 01:28:27.180]   And the Europe's court said, no, it can be taken down throughout the EU.
[01:28:27.180 --> 01:28:33.220]   And they're trying to say that the platforms have to work very hard to make sure that you
[01:28:33.220 --> 01:28:37.580]   discourage people from going to make an American search to get around it.
[01:28:37.580 --> 01:28:46.540]   But it recognized freedom of expression and recognized that one nation should not control
[01:28:46.540 --> 01:28:48.420]   the speech of the world.
[01:28:48.420 --> 01:28:52.620]   And I think it was a critically important moment.
[01:28:52.620 --> 01:28:53.620]   Good.
[01:28:53.620 --> 01:29:01.020]   Yeah, that only makes sense.
[01:29:01.020 --> 01:29:06.980]   I mean, Christ, if Google had to delete, you know, post because the French said, oh,
[01:29:06.980 --> 01:29:08.900]   it's wrong all over the world.
[01:29:08.900 --> 01:29:12.020]   That would be not a would no longer be a useful.
[01:29:12.020 --> 01:29:18.460]   And meanwhile, the other thing that happened, I think just before we came on was that Europe's
[01:29:18.460 --> 01:29:25.820]   copyright directive, which I hate, which is old industries going for protectionism, requiring
[01:29:25.820 --> 01:29:26.820]   two things.
[01:29:26.820 --> 01:29:30.540]   One, it's a link tax that that if you want to put a step it up, you're supposed to pay
[01:29:30.540 --> 01:29:31.940]   the publisher, the creator.
[01:29:31.940 --> 01:29:36.820]   And number two is copyright protection, supposedly.
[01:29:36.820 --> 01:29:41.420]   So France is the first country, of course, to implement this.
[01:29:41.420 --> 01:29:46.140]   And Google is refusing to pay publishers for their content.
[01:29:46.140 --> 01:29:50.020]   Google will only put up a snippet, a preview, which you're going to want online.
[01:29:50.020 --> 01:29:53.620]   They're only going to put it up if the publisher says, okay, you can do that for free.
[01:29:53.620 --> 01:29:57.820]   If not, they're going to put up nothing but the link itself.
[01:29:57.820 --> 01:29:59.260]   And guess who's got to get hurt there?
[01:29:59.260 --> 01:30:00.260]   Adiate publishers?
[01:30:00.260 --> 01:30:01.260]   Guess.
[01:30:01.260 --> 01:30:02.260]   Adiate publishers.
[01:30:02.260 --> 01:30:04.740]   Stupid, stupid, stupid.
[01:30:04.740 --> 01:30:07.980]   And the public, and the public, because if you want to see more sources for news and you
[01:30:07.980 --> 01:30:12.420]   want to see more things and more sampling, so it's just stupid, stupid, stupid all around,
[01:30:12.420 --> 01:30:17.940]   but these protectionist industries that think that the way to, I was at full disclosure,
[01:30:17.940 --> 01:30:24.420]   I was at Google Newsgeist in Cartagena over the weekend, where we pay our own expenses,
[01:30:24.420 --> 01:30:29.780]   but they buy the food and the booze, of which there's plenty.
[01:30:29.780 --> 01:30:33.940]   And I sat in a room again with editors and one or two publishers.
[01:30:33.940 --> 01:30:39.780]   And I sat in a similar room in the European event a few months ago, and the publishers
[01:30:39.780 --> 01:30:42.660]   are going off thinking, this is going to save them.
[01:30:42.660 --> 01:30:45.060]   We could just, if we could just hurt Google, that'll save us.
[01:30:45.060 --> 01:30:51.060]   We'll be okay again, which is just absolutely mind exploding insane.
[01:30:51.060 --> 01:30:52.340]   Protectionism doesn't work.
[01:30:52.340 --> 01:30:59.380]   It's not, it creates no value, but they're all using their political clout.
[01:30:59.380 --> 01:31:05.460]   As I said last week on the show in my medium, very long medium, dystopia of dystopian,
[01:31:05.460 --> 01:31:07.820]   I think this all goes to a bad place.
[01:31:07.820 --> 01:31:10.900]   But we saw some protection from the platforms.
[01:31:10.900 --> 01:31:18.020]   In both cases, Google fought against the copyright directive, making them pay for content,
[01:31:18.020 --> 01:31:20.220]   which would hurt the entire web.
[01:31:20.220 --> 01:31:23.580]   And Google fought against erasing history.
[01:31:23.580 --> 01:31:25.620]   So good on Google.
[01:31:25.620 --> 01:31:26.620]   Yes.
[01:31:26.620 --> 01:31:33.740]   Meanwhile, Hollywood is not the biggest Google fan right now.
[01:31:33.740 --> 01:31:34.740]   Who is?
[01:31:34.740 --> 01:31:40.300]   Well, this is an unusual story.
[01:31:40.300 --> 01:31:49.940]   On Monday evening, a bunch of Mac Pro workstations in Hollywood studios stopped working.
[01:31:49.940 --> 01:31:52.380]   These were rendering movie frames.
[01:31:52.380 --> 01:31:55.140]   They were editing video.
[01:31:55.140 --> 01:32:01.060]   Google issued a maya culpa saying, "Oh, we did that."
[01:32:01.060 --> 01:32:08.780]   Apparently a Chrome update damages the file system on Mac OS machines.
[01:32:08.780 --> 01:32:09.940]   So scary.
[01:32:09.940 --> 01:32:11.940]   Oh my God.
[01:32:11.940 --> 01:32:12.940]   So scary.
[01:32:12.940 --> 01:32:13.940]   Oh.
[01:32:13.940 --> 01:32:16.300]   And a simple little browser.
[01:32:16.300 --> 01:32:17.300]   Jeez.
[01:32:17.300 --> 01:32:19.140]   And goodness for redundancy.
[01:32:19.140 --> 01:32:20.340]   That is super scary.
[01:32:20.340 --> 01:32:22.740]   How could a browser do that?
[01:32:22.740 --> 01:32:29.620]   Well, Macintosh has something called system integrity protection, which is an awesome thing.
[01:32:29.620 --> 01:32:30.620]   SIP.
[01:32:30.620 --> 01:32:35.340]   It keeps unauthorized software from modifying protected data.
[01:32:35.340 --> 01:32:41.020]   And incidentally, it's even stronger in the new version of Mac OS, El Capitan.
[01:32:41.020 --> 01:32:43.380]   No, not El Capitan.
[01:32:43.380 --> 01:32:44.380]   Corsica.
[01:32:44.380 --> 01:32:45.380]   No, not Elba.
[01:32:45.380 --> 01:32:46.380]   No, Catalina.
[01:32:46.380 --> 01:32:48.020]   I knew it was an island.
[01:32:48.020 --> 01:32:49.020]   I knew it was an island.
[01:32:49.020 --> 01:32:50.020]   Catalina.
[01:32:50.020 --> 01:32:51.020]   So California.
[01:32:51.020 --> 01:32:53.020]   That island.
[01:32:53.020 --> 01:32:55.220]   Catalina is really aggressive.
[01:32:55.220 --> 01:32:57.420]   I find myself constantly going, "No, no, no.
[01:32:57.420 --> 01:32:58.420]   It's okay.
[01:32:58.420 --> 01:32:59.420]   Let's install this."
[01:32:59.420 --> 01:33:02.220]   And I've in the past had problems with some software not installing.
[01:33:02.220 --> 01:33:04.660]   It's just it is an issue, but it's a good thing.
[01:33:04.660 --> 01:33:08.100]   I think on balance it protects Macintosh users.
[01:33:08.100 --> 01:33:18.100]   But it turns out video editors often disable it to run their third party graphics cards.
[01:33:18.100 --> 01:33:23.060]   So the entire, for instance, the entire video editing team working on modern family.
[01:33:23.060 --> 01:33:27.140]   So modern family comes out late this week.
[01:33:27.140 --> 01:33:28.140]   You'll know why.
[01:33:28.140 --> 01:33:29.140]   Again, redundancy, redundancy.
[01:33:29.140 --> 01:33:31.900]   You have to boot into recovery mode.
[01:33:31.900 --> 01:33:38.580]   There's a long series of terminal commands that will remove the Google software update,
[01:33:38.580 --> 01:33:40.340]   restore the damage portion of the file system.
[01:33:40.340 --> 01:33:42.220]   In other words, it's not permanent.
[01:33:42.220 --> 01:33:43.700]   Thank God.
[01:33:43.700 --> 01:33:49.380]   But it just shows you the risk inherent in this.
[01:33:49.380 --> 01:33:50.380]   It was first identified.
[01:33:50.380 --> 01:33:53.540]   I want to give credit to Mr. Macintosh.
[01:33:53.540 --> 01:33:55.100]   MrMacIntosh.com.
[01:33:55.100 --> 01:33:58.500]   He was the first to discover this.
[01:33:58.500 --> 01:33:59.500]   And it's just a little thing.
[01:33:59.500 --> 01:34:01.140]   It's an easy thing to have happen.
[01:34:01.140 --> 01:34:05.140]   How hard was it to tie it to the Chrome when the machine started going?
[01:34:05.140 --> 01:34:10.140]   Well, I don't think the editors really were able to, but I think once people figured out
[01:34:10.140 --> 01:34:13.340]   that what was happening was a SimLink.
[01:34:13.340 --> 01:34:16.620]   So normally, the /var system is unavailable.
[01:34:16.620 --> 01:34:20.740]   You can't modify it with an update because that's protected by SIP.
[01:34:20.740 --> 01:34:25.700]   If you turn off SIP, then any software you can install will can modify system files.
[01:34:25.700 --> 01:34:31.500]   So there was a SimLink in the /var directory.
[01:34:31.500 --> 01:34:34.340]   Not sure why that was deleted by Chromium.
[01:34:34.340 --> 01:34:36.300]   It would take a sharp eye to figure that out.
[01:34:36.300 --> 01:34:42.340]   But that's why people figured this out.
[01:34:42.340 --> 01:34:44.460]   After rebooting, you'd install the Chrome update.
[01:34:44.460 --> 01:34:47.740]   After rebooting, you'd get a kernel panic.
[01:34:47.740 --> 01:34:49.060]   And you'd be in a boot loop.
[01:34:49.060 --> 01:34:53.660]   Kernel panic, kernel panic, kernel panic, kernel panic.
[01:34:53.660 --> 01:34:59.580]   Avid users some of the first to report the issue because they use third-party graphics
[01:34:59.580 --> 01:35:00.580]   cards.
[01:35:00.580 --> 01:35:02.700]   They turn off SIP.
[01:35:02.700 --> 01:35:04.820]   And that is nasty.
[01:35:04.820 --> 01:35:09.220]   It only affects 10.9 through 10.14 Mojave.
[01:35:09.220 --> 01:35:15.660]   Not sure if Catalina would be affected probably if you're running, not running beta operating
[01:35:15.660 --> 01:35:23.460]   system software if you're doing a national CV show on a short deadline.
[01:35:23.460 --> 01:35:26.620]   At first, some people thought it was Avid causing the problem.
[01:35:26.620 --> 01:35:28.180]   That's when I first saw the story.
[01:35:28.180 --> 01:35:29.740]   I thought it was just all Avid.
[01:35:29.740 --> 01:35:30.740]   Google said it was us.
[01:35:30.740 --> 01:35:31.740]   It was the...
[01:35:31.740 --> 01:35:32.740]   Because all of the adobe...
[01:35:32.740 --> 01:35:33.740]   The beta, beta, beta.
[01:35:33.740 --> 01:35:37.900]   And thank you, Google, for admitting it.
[01:35:37.900 --> 01:35:39.860]   And for publishing a fix.
[01:35:39.860 --> 01:35:44.580]   Even more important.
[01:35:44.580 --> 01:35:45.580]   That's...
[01:35:45.580 --> 01:35:46.580]   Was it all a one day?
[01:35:46.580 --> 01:35:47.580]   It was a crisis, but it was a one day crisis?
[01:35:47.580 --> 01:35:50.180]   No, it took more than a few days to figure it out.
[01:35:50.180 --> 01:35:51.180]   A few days, okay.
[01:35:51.180 --> 01:35:52.180]   Right.
[01:35:52.180 --> 01:35:55.460]   So some people were sitting there with dead Macs.
[01:35:55.460 --> 01:35:58.020]   That's when you go out and you buy a whole new computer.
[01:35:58.020 --> 01:35:59.260]   You spend your $50,000.
[01:35:59.260 --> 01:36:00.260]   You spend your $50,000.
[01:36:00.260 --> 01:36:01.260]   Oh, yeah.
[01:36:01.260 --> 01:36:02.260]   I mean, whoof.
[01:36:02.260 --> 01:36:04.860]   I mean, whoof.
[01:36:04.860 --> 01:36:10.580]   So anything you want to say about Chrome OS 77?
[01:36:10.580 --> 01:36:16.980]   The funny thing is, apparently it's going out to just about every Chromebook out there.
[01:36:16.980 --> 01:36:20.260]   And I have not yet seen Google mention it.
[01:36:20.260 --> 01:36:22.260]   Oh, I have it.
[01:36:22.260 --> 01:36:24.540]   I mean, I run a couple Chromebook.
[01:36:24.540 --> 01:36:26.340]   Yeah, yeah, I have it.
[01:36:26.340 --> 01:36:28.020]   I run a couple devices.
[01:36:28.020 --> 01:36:29.220]   So I run one on stable.
[01:36:29.220 --> 01:36:32.340]   This is Chrome OS 77 stable.
[01:36:32.340 --> 01:36:35.820]   And then I have Dev and Beta and whatnot on other versions.
[01:36:35.820 --> 01:36:43.140]   But on the Chrome releases blog before the show and even now, I do not see that they have
[01:36:43.140 --> 01:36:44.140]   announced this.
[01:36:44.140 --> 01:36:47.020]   Anyway, Jeff, you probably have an update waiting.
[01:36:47.020 --> 01:36:48.780]   I wouldn't do it right now, but...
[01:36:48.780 --> 01:36:49.780]   The middle of the show.
[01:36:49.780 --> 01:36:50.780]   Is it worthy update?
[01:36:50.780 --> 01:36:52.260]   Well, you can download it now.
[01:36:52.260 --> 01:36:53.260]   That's the beauty of it.
[01:36:53.260 --> 01:36:55.740]   You can download it now when you restart after the show.
[01:36:55.740 --> 01:36:56.740]   It'll be there.
[01:36:56.740 --> 01:36:59.820]   So there's no announcement of what's in it.
[01:36:59.820 --> 01:37:01.860]   I mean, I've seen some things that are in it.
[01:37:01.860 --> 01:37:06.100]   One is, as we mentioned earlier in the show, that many other Chromebooks other than the
[01:37:06.100 --> 01:37:10.900]   made by Google devices will have the Google Assistant built in, which is fantastic.
[01:37:10.900 --> 01:37:16.820]   Let's see, there's HD copy protected content support for Android apps.
[01:37:16.820 --> 01:37:24.100]   So if you have an app that uses HDMI 1.4, for example, you couldn't previously pipe that
[01:37:24.100 --> 01:37:26.100]   out from a Chromebook to a TV.
[01:37:26.100 --> 01:37:29.620]   Now you can do that if that's important to you.
[01:37:29.620 --> 01:37:34.180]   The volume control for orientation, they have fixed that on convertibles because that was
[01:37:34.180 --> 01:37:38.260]   backwards when you flipped the device upside down.
[01:37:38.260 --> 01:37:39.260]   File formats.
[01:37:39.260 --> 01:37:43.300]   You can now format external drives, flash drives, and you can pick and choose between
[01:37:43.300 --> 01:37:47.220]   your file format between FAT32 and TFS, et cetera.
[01:37:47.220 --> 01:37:48.980]   So that's kind of nice.
[01:37:48.980 --> 01:37:49.980]   But...
[01:37:49.980 --> 01:37:51.460]   You just stick the FAT32 on...
[01:37:51.460 --> 01:37:54.420]   Well, no, that's just if you're in a Chromebook world, right?
[01:37:54.420 --> 01:37:55.420]   Yeah.
[01:37:55.420 --> 01:37:59.980]   I think that might have been the default prior to.
[01:37:59.980 --> 01:38:04.780]   So not a huge amount of updates that I know of right now, but I literally just updated
[01:38:04.780 --> 01:38:09.140]   in class before I came here and haven't really dug around too much.
[01:38:09.140 --> 01:38:10.900]   I'm downloading it right now.
[01:38:10.900 --> 01:38:12.380]   There you go.
[01:38:12.380 --> 01:38:14.300]   Okay, but don't hit reboot.
[01:38:14.300 --> 01:38:15.300]   Don't restart.
[01:38:15.300 --> 01:38:16.300]   Don't worry.
[01:38:16.300 --> 01:38:17.300]   It's not...
[01:38:17.300 --> 01:38:18.900]   You're not using it for this for you.
[01:38:18.900 --> 01:38:19.900]   It's okay.
[01:38:19.900 --> 01:38:25.020]   It's weird, though, Kevin.
[01:38:25.020 --> 01:38:28.620]   Back in the day, new OS's would come out, new OS versions would come out, and all the
[01:38:28.620 --> 01:38:30.300]   new features and all those would be all excited.
[01:38:30.300 --> 01:38:34.100]   Of course, this is absolutely unnoticeable, which is the whole point of Chrome.
[01:38:34.100 --> 01:38:41.300]   But when new features come out, you don't really get a place to easily, clearly, except
[01:38:41.300 --> 01:38:44.940]   by reading you, but for the consumer.
[01:38:44.940 --> 01:38:49.500]   I think the entire new features and new commands come out and people don't even know it.
[01:38:49.500 --> 01:38:54.140]   So I agree with you, and I'll be honest, Jeff, when I was at Google working with the Chrome
[01:38:54.140 --> 01:38:58.420]   Enterprise team, I raised this issue to anybody who would listen.
[01:38:58.420 --> 01:39:01.980]   And actually, the enterprise side does do a good job of explaining what's in there for
[01:39:01.980 --> 01:39:03.220]   enterprises.
[01:39:03.220 --> 01:39:07.100]   On the other side, the consumer side, it has not been good.
[01:39:07.100 --> 01:39:13.340]   However, you will probably notice this when you update, because I'm looking right now,
[01:39:13.340 --> 01:39:18.300]   when you go in your settings in Chrome with 77, underneath the Check for Updates button,
[01:39:18.300 --> 01:39:20.980]   there's a new link called "See What's New."
[01:39:20.980 --> 01:39:23.060]   It's not like a super-detail log.
[01:39:23.060 --> 01:39:24.060]   I'm going to say--
[01:39:24.060 --> 01:39:25.060]   Well, let's try the announcement.
[01:39:25.060 --> 01:39:26.060]   We're going to do that.
[01:39:26.060 --> 01:39:27.060]   That's better than nothing, though.
[01:39:27.060 --> 01:39:28.060]   Correct.
[01:39:28.060 --> 01:39:29.060]   Correct.
[01:39:29.060 --> 01:39:33.660]   So I'm looking at it now on mine, and yeah, it's showing me the Google Assistant integration,
[01:39:33.660 --> 01:39:40.340]   the new media controls at the bottom right of your display, which is nice to have a
[01:39:40.340 --> 01:39:42.820]   new family link feature.
[01:39:42.820 --> 01:39:47.580]   The Chromebook camera app has been updated, automatic clicks, which is something if you
[01:39:47.580 --> 01:39:52.420]   for accessibility, if you just hover over a link for X amount of seconds, it will just
[01:39:52.420 --> 01:39:54.420]   click it for you.
[01:39:54.420 --> 01:39:57.580]   So that's really all they're showing in there in the "What's New?"
[01:39:57.580 --> 01:40:00.100]   But it's a step.
[01:40:00.100 --> 01:40:05.980]   Do you keep a machine on Canary?
[01:40:05.980 --> 01:40:08.860]   I generally don't do Canary.
[01:40:08.860 --> 01:40:13.940]   And for those who don't know, Canary changes almost every day, if not multiple times a
[01:40:13.940 --> 01:40:14.940]   day.
[01:40:14.940 --> 01:40:16.340]   So it's constantly--
[01:40:16.340 --> 01:40:21.380]   It's where all of the Google Chromium team software changes go into, and they push it
[01:40:21.380 --> 01:40:23.260]   out, and it gets tested, and so on.
[01:40:23.260 --> 01:40:26.140]   So you could be in the beta channel, which is less than Canary.
[01:40:26.140 --> 01:40:28.500]   How often does beta get updated?
[01:40:28.500 --> 01:40:30.580]   Beta is updated every two weeks.
[01:40:30.580 --> 01:40:35.500]   I use also the dev channel on a third device, and that's updated every couple of days or
[01:40:35.500 --> 01:40:36.500]   so.
[01:40:36.500 --> 01:40:42.460]   And Chrome OS has updated roughly over six weeks, so you can see a couple iterations in beta.
[01:40:42.460 --> 01:40:46.020]   You see far more in dev, but things are kind of maybe broken.
[01:40:46.020 --> 01:40:48.380]   I wouldn't do that on a production machine.
[01:40:48.380 --> 01:40:51.660]   My production machine for class, and I'll run stable.
[01:40:51.660 --> 01:40:53.660]   But yeah, it's nice to see.
[01:40:53.660 --> 01:40:59.420]   And the nice thing is, if you needed to restore a Chromebook, it's all of a five-minute process.
[01:40:59.420 --> 01:41:01.420]   It's like Powerwash.
[01:41:01.420 --> 01:41:02.420]   Good old-time.
[01:41:02.420 --> 01:41:03.420]   That's true.
[01:41:03.420 --> 01:41:05.340]   It's really easy to fit back out.
[01:41:05.340 --> 01:41:09.660]   Which I haven't done in probably a year, and probably it's hygiene just to do it.
[01:41:09.660 --> 01:41:11.860]   Yeah, I don't need to do it.
[01:41:11.860 --> 01:41:13.340]   Yeah.
[01:41:13.340 --> 01:41:16.180]   Just make sure that any local data that you have stored in there--
[01:41:16.180 --> 01:41:17.180]   That's all.
[01:41:17.180 --> 01:41:20.220]   That's under both free drive and copy everything off it.
[01:41:20.220 --> 01:41:22.700]   It's no big deal.
[01:41:22.700 --> 01:41:26.100]   So Facebook also had an event today.
[01:41:26.100 --> 01:41:27.260]   That's snuck up on me.
[01:41:27.260 --> 01:41:28.260]   Yeah.
[01:41:28.260 --> 01:41:29.260]   And they announced this.
[01:41:29.260 --> 01:41:31.820]   Are you going to play Horizon?
[01:41:31.820 --> 01:41:37.220]   A massively multiplayer virtual reality world.
[01:41:37.220 --> 01:41:38.900]   Get ready, ready Player One.
[01:41:38.900 --> 01:41:42.820]   This launch in closed beta early next year.
[01:41:42.820 --> 01:41:48.140]   You'll design your own avatar, hop between virtual look locales through portals called
[01:41:48.140 --> 01:41:50.020]   telepods.
[01:41:50.020 --> 01:41:52.740]   You'll watch movies and consume-- no, you won't.
[01:41:52.740 --> 01:41:56.540]   You'll watch movies and consume other media with friends and play multiplayer games together
[01:41:56.540 --> 01:41:57.780]   like wing strikers.
[01:41:57.780 --> 01:42:03.100]   It'll include human guides known as Horizon locals who can give users assistance and
[01:42:03.100 --> 01:42:06.980]   protect their safety so trolls can't run rampant.
[01:42:06.980 --> 01:42:09.220]   Wow.
[01:42:09.220 --> 01:42:14.540]   Now remember Facebook's spaces, which we played a little bit with when the Oculus Rift came
[01:42:14.540 --> 01:42:18.420]   out and was really weird and not very much fun.
[01:42:18.420 --> 01:42:20.620]   I can't say I remember spaces.
[01:42:20.620 --> 01:42:25.420]   Yeah, you'd have to have a Rift to play it.
[01:42:25.420 --> 01:42:29.340]   And when we tried it, I think on the new screensavers, oh, Shucks, I can't sign up.
[01:42:29.340 --> 01:42:32.500]   You have to have a Facebook account to play this.
[01:42:32.500 --> 01:42:33.500]   Don't.
[01:42:33.500 --> 01:42:34.900]   See what you lose?
[01:42:34.900 --> 01:42:36.860]   Oh, actually, I take it back.
[01:42:36.860 --> 01:42:38.460]   You can create an Oculus account.
[01:42:38.460 --> 01:42:41.340]   I have one because we do have an Oculus Rift.
[01:42:41.340 --> 01:42:43.620]   So-- but I don't know.
[01:42:43.620 --> 01:42:46.140]   I can't stay too long in a VR world.
[01:42:46.140 --> 01:42:48.780]   I didn't even know this event was happening today.
[01:42:48.780 --> 01:42:49.940]   And I saw the--
[01:42:49.940 --> 01:42:51.220]   It's their big Oculus event.
[01:42:51.220 --> 01:42:52.980]   Couple headlines, pop-up about it.
[01:42:52.980 --> 01:42:54.740]   Yeah.
[01:42:54.740 --> 01:42:56.060]   I like that they're updating.
[01:42:56.060 --> 01:43:00.060]   I don't think this piece mentions it, but they're updating the interface to allow you
[01:43:00.060 --> 01:43:04.260]   to use your hands more instead of using actual control.
[01:43:04.260 --> 01:43:05.100]   That's good.
[01:43:05.100 --> 01:43:08.060]   Sort of tracking fingers and digits and--
[01:43:08.060 --> 01:43:10.540]   Did you do Second Life when Second Life was big?
[01:43:10.540 --> 01:43:11.540]   I did not.
[01:43:11.540 --> 01:43:12.540]   I was it.
[01:43:12.540 --> 01:43:14.260]   I wasn't that nerdy just yet.
[01:43:14.260 --> 01:43:16.140]   You want to know what my Second Life handle is?
[01:43:16.140 --> 01:43:17.140]   What was it?
[01:43:17.140 --> 01:43:19.380]   Pruneface spatula.
[01:43:19.380 --> 01:43:24.180]   And that was randomly picked by an engine.
[01:43:24.180 --> 01:43:28.380]   But yeah, Second Life got weird towards the end.
[01:43:28.380 --> 01:43:30.140]   And actually, I think it's still going.
[01:43:30.140 --> 01:43:32.380]   Yeah, Dwight Schrute still plays it.
[01:43:32.380 --> 01:43:34.460]   Yeah, of course he does.
[01:43:34.460 --> 01:43:38.020]   He's got his own beat farm in Second Life.
[01:43:38.020 --> 01:43:40.460]   I think there was a lot of sexy stuff going on there.
[01:43:40.460 --> 01:43:42.180]   Because you could buy a nude suit.
[01:43:42.180 --> 01:43:43.180]   I heard about that.
[01:43:43.180 --> 01:43:44.180]   That was weird.
[01:43:44.180 --> 01:43:45.180]   It was weird.
[01:43:45.180 --> 01:43:46.180]   Here is a video.
[01:43:46.180 --> 01:43:48.300]   I don't think there'll be nude suits in Facebook or Verizon.
[01:43:48.300 --> 01:43:51.300]   Horizon, here's a video of talking about--
[01:43:51.300 --> 01:43:52.780]   Beyond our world.
[01:43:52.780 --> 01:43:53.780]   Oh, wait, but first of all--
[01:43:53.780 --> 01:43:54.780]   There's another one.
[01:43:54.780 --> 01:43:58.980]   Do you want to be the nerdy person while your husband's making dinner in the kitchen?
[01:43:58.980 --> 01:44:02.340]   You standing in the living room dancing with strangers?
[01:44:02.340 --> 01:44:03.340]   That's terrible.
[01:44:03.340 --> 01:44:04.340]   That's better.
[01:44:04.340 --> 01:44:05.340]   You might want to put them to work.
[01:44:05.340 --> 01:44:07.620]   On my face.
[01:44:07.620 --> 01:44:08.620]   Welcome.
[01:44:08.620 --> 01:44:09.620]   This is--
[01:44:09.620 --> 01:44:10.620]   Not actual VR footage.
[01:44:10.620 --> 01:44:12.620]   I have no legs.
[01:44:12.620 --> 01:44:13.620]   No legs.
[01:44:13.620 --> 01:44:14.620]   I am floating.
[01:44:14.620 --> 01:44:15.620]   It's orco.
[01:44:15.620 --> 01:44:18.620]   Oh, this is creepy that nobody has legs.
[01:44:18.620 --> 01:44:19.620]   It really is.
[01:44:19.620 --> 01:44:22.620]   Is this like a big quick legs?
[01:44:22.620 --> 01:44:25.620]   Remember the new Tinder Wii?
[01:44:25.620 --> 01:44:28.260]   These are like-- what do they call them?
[01:44:28.260 --> 01:44:29.260]   Wegians?
[01:44:29.260 --> 01:44:30.260]   We were ebees?
[01:44:30.260 --> 01:44:32.060]   Or people telling you not to fly.
[01:44:32.060 --> 01:44:33.420]   Her poor husband really looks kind of--
[01:44:33.420 --> 01:44:34.420]   A poor husband, really.
[01:44:34.420 --> 01:44:36.820]   A French-prout, fair trade, French-pressed morning coffee through a curly straw.
[01:44:36.820 --> 01:44:38.820]   Isn't that right, Debbie?
[01:44:38.820 --> 01:44:39.820]   Mm-hmm.
[01:44:39.820 --> 01:44:43.940]   It's not okay now, but it's a fine new thing.
[01:44:43.940 --> 01:44:44.940]   Making your mark.
[01:44:44.940 --> 01:44:47.580]   You know, it doesn't bother you so much if you don't have legs when you're sitting in
[01:44:47.580 --> 01:44:48.580]   an airplane, but boy, if you're in--
[01:44:48.580 --> 01:44:50.580]   We're making friends, but we're not struggling anymore.
[01:44:50.580 --> 01:44:51.580]   Walk around.
[01:44:51.580 --> 01:44:52.580]   This is the creepy line.
[01:44:52.580 --> 01:44:53.580]   I'm from New Zealand.
[01:44:53.580 --> 01:44:56.020]   I mean, how do you carry your wallet in this world?
[01:44:56.020 --> 01:44:57.620]   You can even build a world of your own.
[01:44:57.620 --> 01:45:02.980]   Like, these are tag poon landy.
[01:45:02.980 --> 01:45:05.020]   Or this islandy place.
[01:45:05.020 --> 01:45:07.020]   Like these cutie poon dumplings.
[01:45:07.020 --> 01:45:08.020]   Oop.
[01:45:08.020 --> 01:45:09.020]   Oop.
[01:45:09.020 --> 01:45:10.020]   Oop.
[01:45:10.020 --> 01:45:11.020]   Alright.
[01:45:11.020 --> 01:45:12.420]   In Verizon, the world is yours.
[01:45:12.420 --> 01:45:14.660]   I wish it would be like this, but this is not.
[01:45:14.660 --> 01:45:15.660]   You used to?
[01:45:15.660 --> 01:45:16.660]   What?
[01:45:16.660 --> 01:45:17.660]   Look.
[01:45:17.660 --> 01:45:18.660]   That too.
[01:45:18.660 --> 01:45:19.660]   So come.
[01:45:19.660 --> 01:45:20.660]   Join us.
[01:45:20.660 --> 01:45:21.660]   I'm never ending, ever changing.
[01:45:21.660 --> 01:45:25.660]   It's a mistake to make this video because it probably is something that you don't have
[01:45:25.660 --> 01:45:26.660]   to live in.
[01:45:26.660 --> 01:45:28.460]   It's very ready Player One.
[01:45:28.460 --> 01:45:32.780]   Look at the demographics though of the people in that video.
[01:45:32.780 --> 01:45:34.780]   What are the age groups you saw for?
[01:45:34.780 --> 01:45:37.140]   They're all 30-somethings, I guess.
[01:45:37.140 --> 01:45:39.140]   Now, do you really think?
[01:45:39.140 --> 01:45:40.140]   No.
[01:45:40.140 --> 01:45:41.140]   Right.
[01:45:41.140 --> 01:45:45.700]   The other thing they don't show you, they show you these people walking around.
[01:45:45.700 --> 01:45:48.420]   But obviously, she can't walk around.
[01:45:48.420 --> 01:45:51.540]   She'll run into her husband making breakfast.
[01:45:51.540 --> 01:45:57.620]   So you have to have other ways of motivating that are, you know, you throw a thing and
[01:45:57.620 --> 01:45:59.100]   you pull it or something.
[01:45:59.100 --> 01:46:01.380]   It's just not like that.
[01:46:01.380 --> 01:46:03.060]   So anyway.
[01:46:03.060 --> 01:46:07.940]   I appreciate the effort because again, when I read it, I was thinking ready Player One,
[01:46:07.940 --> 01:46:11.660]   but when you look at ready Player One, he had all of these extra devices, the little
[01:46:11.660 --> 01:46:12.660]   treadmill and so forth.
[01:46:12.660 --> 01:46:14.420]   Yeah, that's how you have to move around.
[01:46:14.420 --> 01:46:16.420]   Everybody's not going to do that.
[01:46:16.420 --> 01:46:17.420]   No.
[01:46:17.420 --> 01:46:18.420]   This is...
[01:46:18.420 --> 01:46:20.940]   So what's interesting about this though, one of the most popular parts of Second Life
[01:46:20.940 --> 01:46:24.100]   was the ability to build stuff, create your own stuff.
[01:46:24.100 --> 01:46:25.580]   And they are doing that.
[01:46:25.580 --> 01:46:28.900]   So you have tools that will let you create your own.
[01:46:28.900 --> 01:46:30.900]   They have a world builder.
[01:46:30.900 --> 01:46:34.300]   You create your own gaming arenas, vacation, chill spots.
[01:46:34.300 --> 01:46:35.740]   I like the idea of community.
[01:46:35.740 --> 01:46:36.740]   Tropical Island.
[01:46:36.740 --> 01:46:37.740]   There's not necessarily...
[01:46:37.740 --> 01:46:39.740]   And they did play that out, right?
[01:46:39.740 --> 01:46:40.740]   Right.
[01:46:40.740 --> 01:46:43.500]   So she had a friend who was drinking her coffee through the Swirly Straw, another one in
[01:46:43.500 --> 01:46:44.500]   New Zealand.
[01:46:44.500 --> 01:46:48.940]   You'll see nowadays, when you talk about communities, you hear it more for the people
[01:46:48.940 --> 01:46:52.820]   playing Fortnite or whatever the most popular game at the time is.
[01:46:52.820 --> 01:47:00.180]   But this is just regular people connected in another version of Facebook, if you will.
[01:47:00.180 --> 01:47:04.820]   Well, we wondered, you know, Facebook spent a lot of money on Oculus and we all wondered
[01:47:04.820 --> 01:47:05.820]   what was the plan.
[01:47:05.820 --> 01:47:06.820]   Is that too silly?
[01:47:06.820 --> 01:47:07.820]   Yeah.
[01:47:07.820 --> 01:47:08.820]   And so this is clearly the plan.
[01:47:08.820 --> 01:47:09.820]   It's just...
[01:47:09.820 --> 01:47:10.820]   Is it...
[01:47:10.820 --> 01:47:12.580]   I guess it is next generation Facebook.
[01:47:12.580 --> 01:47:13.980]   I dig that.
[01:47:13.980 --> 01:47:18.140]   But again, you just look at the demographics and look at the hardware that's going to be
[01:47:18.140 --> 01:47:20.300]   required.
[01:47:20.300 --> 01:47:25.660]   You have a hard time just getting people to watch the VR videos on their phone because
[01:47:25.660 --> 01:47:26.660]   they don't want to do that.
[01:47:26.660 --> 01:47:27.660]   Do you think it's going to be...
[01:47:27.660 --> 01:47:29.780]   Nah, you start talking about headsets and things.
[01:47:29.780 --> 01:47:34.500]   It's only going to be the people who use Facebook today, the olds, that are using this.
[01:47:34.500 --> 01:47:35.500]   Right.
[01:47:35.500 --> 01:47:38.620]   So maybe they'll all look like 30-somethings, but they'll really be 60-somethings.
[01:47:38.620 --> 01:47:40.420]   There's that.
[01:47:40.420 --> 01:47:43.620]   Jeff, I'll meet you in horizons there.
[01:47:43.620 --> 01:47:44.620]   Yeah.
[01:47:44.620 --> 01:47:45.620]   We have no legs.
[01:47:45.620 --> 01:47:46.620]   It's okay.
[01:47:46.620 --> 01:47:47.620]   It's okay.
[01:47:47.620 --> 01:47:48.620]   We can't walk anyway.
[01:47:48.620 --> 01:47:50.620]   We don't have to worry about anything.
[01:47:50.620 --> 01:47:54.820]   Don't have to have a walk around because we have no legs.
[01:47:54.820 --> 01:47:59.620]   I can sit on the virtual porch, eat a cracker from the virtual cucker barrel.
[01:47:59.620 --> 01:48:02.220]   We can play checkers, you and me.
[01:48:02.220 --> 01:48:03.220]   Oh my gosh.
[01:48:03.220 --> 01:48:04.220]   Yeah.
[01:48:04.220 --> 01:48:06.420]   Kevin, we should see ourselves out.
[01:48:06.420 --> 01:48:07.820]   I hear you.
[01:48:07.820 --> 01:48:08.820]   I hear you.
[01:48:08.820 --> 01:48:11.940]   This is why I take classes with the younglings.
[01:48:11.940 --> 01:48:16.580]   Do they play Roblox or are they too old for Roblox in your class?
[01:48:16.580 --> 01:48:17.940]   They're not doing Roblox.
[01:48:17.940 --> 01:48:20.260]   So that's the youngs are doing Roblox, right?
[01:48:20.260 --> 01:48:22.060]   That's kind of got its own world too.
[01:48:22.060 --> 01:48:25.340]   So maybe they're going to grow into this.
[01:48:25.340 --> 01:48:36.540]   Also an Oculus Connect Facebook announced they're acquiring control labs, CTRL labs that lets
[01:48:36.540 --> 01:48:39.860]   you control computers with your mind.
[01:48:39.860 --> 01:48:43.060]   Actually, they asked us a couple of.
[01:48:43.060 --> 01:48:44.340]   Here's a, you know what?
[01:48:44.340 --> 01:48:49.980]   It's so funny because the the home, the giga home that's diaspora is everywhere.
[01:48:49.980 --> 01:48:53.860]   We just read Yanko, record story and variety.
[01:48:53.860 --> 01:48:56.820]   This is Kurt Wagner writing for Bloomberg.
[01:48:56.820 --> 01:49:01.460]   All the people used to work with Kevin.
[01:49:01.460 --> 01:49:06.540]   Facebook acquired a four year old startup, closely held dozens of employees.
[01:49:06.540 --> 01:49:09.060]   They've raised tens of millions in venture capital.
[01:49:09.060 --> 01:49:14.900]   They use a bracelet to measure neuron activity in your arm to determine the movement that
[01:49:14.900 --> 01:49:18.580]   you're thinking about, even if you're not moving, which is then true.
[01:49:18.580 --> 01:49:21.940]   See, this would be good for a virtual world and translated into movement on a digital
[01:49:21.940 --> 01:49:23.740]   screen.
[01:49:23.740 --> 01:49:32.700]   So who needs the 360 degree conveyor belt or whatever that thing was, treadmill, you just
[01:49:32.700 --> 01:49:35.020]   put a little strap on your thigh.
[01:49:35.020 --> 01:49:36.020]   But the sensor on.
[01:49:36.020 --> 01:49:40.820]   And a little strap on your arms and you think walk and you think move.
[01:49:40.820 --> 01:49:46.340]   We don't know how much they spent, but Kurt says between 500 million and a billion dollars.
[01:49:46.340 --> 01:49:48.460]   Oh, holy cow.
[01:49:48.460 --> 01:49:57.180]   Now when they get those data points, I wonder, again, security standpoint of it, you know,
[01:49:57.180 --> 01:50:01.300]   who's going to take care of that data, who's going to own it.
[01:50:01.300 --> 01:50:03.420]   You could have the data about what my thigh is thinking.
[01:50:03.420 --> 01:50:04.420]   I don't care.
[01:50:04.420 --> 01:50:07.940]   Well, but if you're talking about tracking, I'll tell you what my thighs thinking right
[01:50:07.940 --> 01:50:08.940]   now.
[01:50:08.940 --> 01:50:13.420]   If you put sensors on this doing electrical impulses and you think you can read your
[01:50:13.420 --> 01:50:14.420]   mind?
[01:50:14.420 --> 01:50:18.820]   You never know.
[01:50:18.820 --> 01:50:19.820]   Another Facebook news.
[01:50:19.820 --> 01:50:26.860]   Jeff Jarvis, you tell me Facebook has decided that if a politician says it, it's okay.
[01:50:26.860 --> 01:50:34.180]   So they actually, they call people sometimes and they actually called me not because I
[01:50:34.180 --> 01:50:36.420]   work for the metal consultant for the metal or anything.
[01:50:36.420 --> 01:50:38.180]   Photos, those are always money for the school.
[01:50:38.180 --> 01:50:39.820]   Are you going to be on that committee?
[01:50:39.820 --> 01:50:41.740]   Are you going to end up being on that?
[01:50:41.740 --> 01:50:42.740]   No.
[01:50:42.740 --> 01:50:46.340]   I have too many kudos.
[01:50:46.340 --> 01:50:55.260]   So, but they called me as they were grappling with this issue about newsmakers, about newsworthiness.
[01:50:55.260 --> 01:50:57.940]   And Twitter was grappling with the same thing and Twitter beat them to the punch.
[01:50:57.940 --> 01:51:03.380]   So Twitter said, if a politician says something that otherwise would violate their rules,
[01:51:03.380 --> 01:51:08.020]   they'll leave it up and put a notice on saying, no, no.
[01:51:08.020 --> 01:51:12.900]   So, to my surprise, decided to leave it up and not put a notice on it because they think
[01:51:12.900 --> 01:51:19.820]   that's kind of meddling in politics on its own, that that notice itself has political
[01:51:19.820 --> 01:51:20.820]   impact.
[01:51:20.820 --> 01:51:26.180]   The problem with that, and I kind of get that, but the problem with that in my mind is number
[01:51:26.180 --> 01:51:31.700]   one, it creates a two tier system that politicians can do what citizens can't do and that's just
[01:51:31.700 --> 01:51:32.700]   wrong.
[01:51:32.700 --> 01:51:36.420]   I had argued to them that they should not take down the politicians thing.
[01:51:36.420 --> 01:51:40.620]   The politicians should be up there for all to see and we should see the politician's
[01:51:40.620 --> 01:51:42.020]   sins.
[01:51:42.020 --> 01:51:45.580]   I do think they should market and say, this would violate our standards.
[01:51:45.580 --> 01:51:51.580]   The reason we're leaving it up is because this person is a newsmaker of this sort, but they
[01:51:51.580 --> 01:51:53.180]   decided not to do that.
[01:51:53.180 --> 01:51:55.580]   And we'll see how it goes.
[01:51:55.580 --> 01:51:59.300]   You know what's going to happen is that certain major politicians are going to put up stuff
[01:51:59.300 --> 01:52:04.980]   and people are going to scream that it should be taken down and they're not going to because
[01:52:04.980 --> 01:52:09.660]   that's their policy now, but neither are they going to label it and there's going to be
[01:52:09.660 --> 01:52:12.100]   no repercussions for bad behavior.
[01:52:12.100 --> 01:52:16.100]   The more I pass it, the more I think it is.
[01:52:16.100 --> 01:52:19.380]   Well, yeah, I'm not crazy about the decision.
[01:52:19.380 --> 01:52:20.380]   It's passing the buck.
[01:52:20.380 --> 01:52:22.020]   Again, I don't think they should have taken it down.
[01:52:22.020 --> 01:52:26.020]   I think politicians should have to live with their infamy.
[01:52:26.020 --> 01:52:29.020]   But I think Facebook doesn't make a stand.
[01:52:29.020 --> 01:52:30.020]   Yeah.
[01:52:30.020 --> 01:52:32.060]   There's so much news today.
[01:52:32.060 --> 01:52:34.900]   I'm not going to get to it all.
[01:52:34.900 --> 01:52:41.940]   I'll do a couple of quickies here and anybody wants to say anything and jump in.
[01:52:41.940 --> 01:52:45.740]   Great interview with Maureen Dowd in the New York Times with Bob Iger, the chairman of
[01:52:45.740 --> 01:52:46.740]   Disney.
[01:52:46.740 --> 01:52:51.420]   He says, "We decided not to buy Twitter at the last minute because the nastiness on the
[01:52:51.420 --> 01:52:54.380]   platform is extraordinary."
[01:52:54.380 --> 01:52:55.380]   And thank goodness.
[01:52:55.380 --> 01:52:57.540]   Could you imagine a Disney-ified Twitter?
[01:52:57.540 --> 01:52:58.540]   Yick.
[01:52:58.540 --> 01:52:59.540]   Yick.
[01:52:59.540 --> 01:53:05.980]   Facebook and Google have ad trackers on your TV.
[01:53:05.980 --> 01:53:12.460]   The weirdest part of this story was the research that said, "Even if you don't have a Netflix
[01:53:12.460 --> 01:53:18.260]   account, the Netflix app on your Roku or other device is still watching what you're watching."
[01:53:18.260 --> 01:53:19.260]   Wait, what?
[01:53:19.260 --> 01:53:20.260]   Wait, what?
[01:53:20.260 --> 01:53:24.140]   You don't even have to have an account.
[01:53:24.140 --> 01:53:35.140]   Two Americans have been charged with tech support scamming the elderly for $10 million.
[01:53:35.140 --> 01:53:39.140]   US Attorney's Office for SDNY announced the arrests.
[01:53:39.140 --> 01:53:44.340]   Romana, Levia of Las Vegas and RFL hack of Bell Rose, New York are being charged with
[01:53:44.340 --> 01:53:49.420]   one kind of wire fraud, one kind of conspiracy to commit wire fraud.
[01:53:49.420 --> 01:53:52.260]   Each charge carries a maximum sense of 20 years in prison.
[01:53:52.260 --> 01:53:54.060]   I hope to throw the book at them.
[01:53:54.060 --> 01:54:00.740]   These are two of the many people who put pop-ups on your screen saying, "Your computer has
[01:54:00.740 --> 01:54:01.740]   a virus.
[01:54:01.740 --> 01:54:03.540]   Call us."
[01:54:03.540 --> 01:54:05.500]   And we've all encountered that, right?
[01:54:05.500 --> 01:54:06.500]   Yeah.
[01:54:06.500 --> 01:54:09.500]   I'm glad that someone is being held responsible for this.
[01:54:09.500 --> 01:54:10.500]   They made some money.
[01:54:10.500 --> 01:54:11.500]   So, for a second.
[01:54:11.500 --> 01:54:13.260]   Seventy five hundred victims, $10 million.
[01:54:13.260 --> 01:54:14.260]   Yeah.
[01:54:14.260 --> 01:54:18.140]   They made some money, but not anymore.
[01:54:18.140 --> 01:54:19.540]   Jeff and I don't see those.
[01:54:19.540 --> 01:54:20.540]   Not on Chromebooks.
[01:54:20.540 --> 01:54:21.540]   Oh, yeah, you don't.
[01:54:21.540 --> 01:54:22.540]   No.
[01:54:22.540 --> 01:54:24.220]   That's the funny thing.
[01:54:24.220 --> 01:54:27.020]   Because if the way they're doing it is a website pop-up, you probably will see it, but
[01:54:27.020 --> 01:54:28.820]   you can ignore it because you're not.
[01:54:28.820 --> 01:54:29.820]   Exactly.
[01:54:29.820 --> 01:54:30.820]   Windows.
[01:54:30.820 --> 01:54:31.820]   Let's see.
[01:54:31.820 --> 01:54:36.420]   I want to do the change lock.
[01:54:36.420 --> 01:54:37.860]   So I'm just going to go through a few things.
[01:54:37.860 --> 01:54:46.100]   Google put up a whole corpus of deep fakes so the researchers can figure out what they're
[01:54:46.100 --> 01:54:47.100]   doing, which I think is great.
[01:54:47.100 --> 01:54:51.100]   Twitter, by the way, is not on the rundown, but Twitter, which before had released a bunch
[01:54:51.100 --> 01:54:56.020]   of Russian fake tweets, now added other stuff from other countries.
[01:54:56.020 --> 01:55:01.580]   So again, the more these places reveal data for researchers, the more that's a good thing.
[01:55:01.580 --> 01:55:04.740]   Keep doing it.
[01:55:04.740 --> 01:55:14.860]   ImageNet, which is a massive database of faces, which unfortunately were categorized.
[01:55:14.860 --> 01:55:17.140]   Let me see if I can find a picture of myself.
[01:55:17.140 --> 01:55:18.140]   We're categorized.
[01:55:18.140 --> 01:55:19.740]   Oh, I can just do it in the webcam.
[01:55:19.740 --> 01:55:20.740]   Let's do this.
[01:55:20.740 --> 01:55:25.020]   So, categorized by humans, and you know how bad humans are.
[01:55:25.020 --> 01:55:27.900]   So the problem here is not the technology.
[01:55:27.900 --> 01:55:28.900]   It is the human.
[01:55:28.900 --> 01:55:30.140]   Yeah, I've bought this database.
[01:55:30.140 --> 01:55:31.300]   It's widely used.
[01:55:31.300 --> 01:55:38.700]   All right, I'm going to upload a snapshot of me and see what ImageNet roulette, which,
[01:55:38.700 --> 01:55:40.180]   by the way, oh, it stopped.
[01:55:40.180 --> 01:55:44.100]   Oh, shoot, I wanted to show you this.
[01:55:44.100 --> 01:55:50.500]   Because it, I did this before and it said that I was, oh, no, here it is.
[01:55:50.500 --> 01:55:51.500]   Here it is.
[01:55:51.500 --> 01:55:52.500]   It says I'm a news reader.
[01:55:52.500 --> 01:55:54.340]   Oh, well.
[01:55:54.340 --> 01:55:57.740]   A person or individual who reads out a broadcast news bulletin.
[01:55:57.740 --> 01:56:00.580]   Let me do it without the microphone.
[01:56:00.580 --> 01:56:03.940]   That might have given it a hit.
[01:56:03.940 --> 01:56:05.940]   Let's get that.
[01:56:05.940 --> 01:56:07.940]   My cuspin moved.
[01:56:07.940 --> 01:56:10.220]   Yeah, you're going to have to--
[01:56:10.220 --> 01:56:12.980]   Because we're allowing this to use our camera, which is so--
[01:56:12.980 --> 01:56:13.980]   By itself.
[01:56:13.980 --> 01:56:15.300]   This is an art project, by the way.
[01:56:15.300 --> 01:56:20.700]   And I don't-- I wasn't immediately clear if the ImageNet roulette, which was clown,
[01:56:20.700 --> 01:56:25.220]   buffoon, goof, goofball, Mary Andrew.
[01:56:25.220 --> 01:56:26.220]   What?
[01:56:26.220 --> 01:56:29.380]   It does know I'm an entertainer.
[01:56:29.380 --> 01:56:32.620]   A person who muses others by ridiculous behavior.
[01:56:32.620 --> 01:56:33.620]   Shh.
[01:56:33.620 --> 01:56:34.620]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:56:34.620 --> 01:56:35.620]   Shh.
[01:56:35.620 --> 01:56:37.140]   Guess what it said about me.
[01:56:37.140 --> 01:56:38.140]   What?
[01:56:38.140 --> 01:56:39.140]   Septigenarian.
[01:56:39.140 --> 01:56:40.140]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:56:40.140 --> 01:56:41.140]   F-U.
[01:56:41.140 --> 01:56:42.140]   All right.
[01:56:42.140 --> 01:56:43.140]   Come on, Ant.
[01:56:43.140 --> 01:56:48.580]   Now, really, you want to do this with somebody African-American, because that was part of
[01:56:48.580 --> 01:56:54.180]   the issue was that they would say, you know, thief, hood, you know--
[01:56:54.180 --> 01:56:55.180]   Exactly.
[01:56:55.180 --> 01:56:56.180]   That's exactly what I was curious to say.
[01:56:56.180 --> 01:56:59.500]   --take a picture, and we'll see what it'll do with Ant.
[01:56:59.500 --> 01:57:05.780]   But the good news is, after this, and an article about it in the New York Times, ImageNet said,
[01:57:05.780 --> 01:57:10.500]   yeah, we're going to go through some of these images and see if we can fix that.
[01:57:10.500 --> 01:57:11.500]   It's humans.
[01:57:11.500 --> 01:57:15.460]   It's a system set up so that the worst of humans can come out, and they're going to
[01:57:15.460 --> 01:57:16.460]   come out.
[01:57:16.460 --> 01:57:19.900]   So Ant has sent it a pretty scary picture.
[01:57:19.900 --> 01:57:21.740]   Wait a minute.
[01:57:21.740 --> 01:57:22.740]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:57:22.740 --> 01:57:23.740]   I don't know.
[01:57:23.740 --> 01:57:24.740]   You look scary, Ant.
[01:57:24.740 --> 01:57:25.740]   It's those muscles.
[01:57:25.740 --> 01:57:27.220]   Well, it's thinking.
[01:57:27.220 --> 01:57:28.220]   It's thinking.
[01:57:28.220 --> 01:57:30.220]   It's processing.
[01:57:30.220 --> 01:57:34.220]   New York Times article, I think, brought it this to light.
[01:57:34.220 --> 01:57:36.420]   And it was pretty funny with-- now, what does it say about you?
[01:57:36.420 --> 01:57:37.420]   Does it say anything?
[01:57:37.420 --> 01:57:38.420]   It's still thinking.
[01:57:38.420 --> 01:57:39.420]   It's still thinking.
[01:57:39.420 --> 01:57:40.420]   It can't classify you.
[01:57:40.420 --> 01:57:41.420]   It's just thinking.
[01:57:41.420 --> 01:57:42.420]   It's just spinning.
[01:57:42.420 --> 01:57:43.420]   It's just spinning.
[01:57:43.420 --> 01:57:44.420]   Yeah.
[01:57:44.420 --> 01:57:45.420]   I think it doesn't want to offend me.
[01:57:45.420 --> 01:57:46.420]   I give them credit for that.
[01:57:46.420 --> 01:57:52.060]   Well, in effect, maybe it was worse before because they did modify it.
[01:57:52.060 --> 01:57:55.060]   I think it's going to be a little bit more than that.
[01:57:55.060 --> 01:57:59.060]   I think it's going to be a little bit more than that.
[01:57:59.060 --> 01:58:03.660]   I think it's going to be a little bit more than that.
[01:58:03.660 --> 01:58:06.500]   I think it's going to be a little bit more than that.
[01:58:06.500 --> 01:58:12.900]   In effect, maybe it was worse before because they did modify it after this art project,
[01:58:12.900 --> 01:58:13.900]   showing.
[01:58:13.900 --> 01:58:20.100]   The CEO of WeWork has, after receiving a lot of pressure and having to put off their IPO
[01:58:20.100 --> 01:58:25.580]   resigned as chief executive, Adam Newman, though, takes a lot of money with him.
[01:58:25.580 --> 01:58:26.580]   Doesn't know.
[01:58:26.580 --> 01:58:27.580]   It always works.
[01:58:27.580 --> 01:58:30.380]   We still chair.
[01:58:30.380 --> 01:58:32.380]   Yeah.
[01:58:32.380 --> 01:58:34.380]   Yeah.
[01:58:34.380 --> 01:58:41.820]   Very good article I thought in The Hustle about the graphing calculator, the TI-83, which I
[01:58:41.820 --> 01:58:46.940]   have bought several for my high school age children because it was required.
[01:58:46.940 --> 01:58:52.620]   This is a graphing calculator that TI basically has a monopoly in.
[01:58:52.620 --> 01:58:54.380]   They don't say it's $150.
[01:58:54.380 --> 01:58:59.460]   They don't say how much money they've made, but they've sold tens of millions of them,
[01:58:59.460 --> 01:59:07.180]   only because they lobbied hard over the last 20 years to make their calculators required
[01:59:07.180 --> 01:59:11.220]   in classrooms and by the college boards, board and testing.
[01:59:11.220 --> 01:59:17.980]   They paid lobbyists to hound the Department of Education every year right around the time
[01:59:17.980 --> 01:59:21.580]   when mobile technology and apps are becoming more of a threat.
[01:59:21.580 --> 01:59:27.580]   You can get a free graphing calculator for your smartphone, but they even got the Texas
[01:59:27.580 --> 01:59:32.940]   legislature to make it mandatory for all students to take algebra to.
[01:59:32.940 --> 01:59:33.940]   Why?
[01:59:33.940 --> 01:59:37.980]   Well, because it requires a use of a TI graphing calculator.
[01:59:37.980 --> 01:59:46.580]   20 million graphing calculators sold at $100 a pop, 40% of all American high school students,
[01:59:46.580 --> 01:59:51.740]   and you don't really need one, except that you have to have one because they won't let
[01:59:51.740 --> 01:59:55.060]   you take a smartphone into the test room.
[01:59:55.060 --> 01:59:59.700]   It basically sucks, as Marcus Grant and 11th grader currently taking pre-calculus.
[01:59:59.700 --> 02:00:01.540]   It was really expensive for my family.
[02:00:01.540 --> 02:00:06.580]   There are cheaper alternatives available, but my teacher makes the TI calculator mandatory
[02:00:06.580 --> 02:00:08.580]   and there's no other option.
[02:00:08.580 --> 02:00:10.580]   It was true also at my kid's school.
[02:00:10.580 --> 02:00:13.780]   In fact, Abby lost one, so I bought three.
[02:00:13.780 --> 02:00:15.740]   Oh my gosh.
[02:00:15.740 --> 02:00:21.220]   Cassio has $50 calculators that do the same thing, but they always say, "TI."
[02:00:21.220 --> 02:00:22.900]   They say, "Get a TI calculator."
[02:00:22.900 --> 02:00:24.460]   They tell you that.
[02:00:24.460 --> 02:00:27.900]   There's a lot of students can't afford $150 for a graphing calculator.
[02:00:27.900 --> 02:00:28.900]   They don't need one.
[02:00:28.900 --> 02:00:34.100]   I remember 11th or 12th grade and needing to have to get one at ease.
[02:00:34.100 --> 02:00:35.100]   You remember us.
[02:00:35.100 --> 02:00:36.100]   Yep.
[02:00:36.100 --> 02:00:37.860]   My mother wasn't buying it.
[02:00:37.860 --> 02:00:38.860]   Good for her.
[02:00:38.860 --> 02:00:43.860]   I had a TI 1795 calculator.
[02:00:43.860 --> 02:00:45.420]   I think that's what it was.
[02:00:45.420 --> 02:00:47.100]   It was no different from your tin key.
[02:00:47.100 --> 02:00:52.140]   As a result, look what happened to your hot guys' toes now because you couldn't pass math.
[02:00:52.140 --> 02:00:55.020]   My mom's in here to use this.
[02:00:55.020 --> 02:01:01.180]   Leo, note the competition as an app reversed the model of the calculator.
[02:01:01.180 --> 02:01:02.180]   This is what's really fascinating.
[02:01:02.180 --> 02:01:03.660]   Oh, I thought that was great.
[02:01:03.660 --> 02:01:04.660]   Go ahead.
[02:01:04.660 --> 02:01:05.660]   No, you say it.
[02:01:05.660 --> 02:01:07.900]   Well, no, because I'm going to get it wrong, you have it right in front of you.
[02:01:07.900 --> 02:01:14.060]   Well, the idea is that instead of charging the user, they charge the schools.
[02:01:14.060 --> 02:01:15.380]   Okay, so wait a minute.
[02:01:15.380 --> 02:01:19.900]   We've got the results back from Ants Image Roulette.
[02:01:19.900 --> 02:01:21.460]   What did it say about you?
[02:01:21.460 --> 02:01:23.460]   Longdoer offender.
[02:01:23.460 --> 02:01:24.460]   Wow.
[02:01:24.460 --> 02:01:26.460]   That's black.
[02:01:26.460 --> 02:01:28.460]   That's right.
[02:01:28.460 --> 02:01:30.460]   Is that hurtful?
[02:01:30.460 --> 02:01:31.460]   It's hurtful.
[02:01:31.460 --> 02:01:34.260]   Yeah, that's awful.
[02:01:34.260 --> 02:01:40.540]   So the good news is at least it's been exposed thanks to this art project, Image Roulette,
[02:01:40.540 --> 02:01:42.660]   and the New York Times did a big article on it.
[02:01:42.660 --> 02:01:45.620]   That's by the way, exactly the words that they quoted.
[02:01:45.620 --> 02:01:48.700]   Where do the tags come from?
[02:01:48.700 --> 02:01:50.460]   How do the tags in this?
[02:01:50.460 --> 02:01:51.460]   Look at this.
[02:01:51.460 --> 02:01:53.460]   Remember the Amazon Mechanical Turk?
[02:01:53.460 --> 02:01:54.460]   Yeah.
[02:01:54.460 --> 02:01:56.780]   It was a really cheap crowdsourcing thing.
[02:01:56.780 --> 02:02:02.700]   They may still do it for all I know, where they pay pennies for the work.
[02:02:02.700 --> 02:02:05.740]   But people all over the world would do the work.
[02:02:05.740 --> 02:02:09.860]   And I'm guessing from some of the phrases we've even heard here that these are people,
[02:02:09.860 --> 02:02:12.620]   probably in India and other places, not in the US.
[02:02:12.620 --> 02:02:13.620]   Right.
[02:02:13.620 --> 02:02:16.020]   Although the New York Times article said they were in the US, but the Amazon Mechanical
[02:02:16.020 --> 02:02:20.180]   Turk did not make restrictions about what your geographic location was.
[02:02:20.180 --> 02:02:22.620]   They give you a couple of cents to do some job.
[02:02:22.620 --> 02:02:25.060]   For instance, label this photograph.
[02:02:25.060 --> 02:02:28.540]   So all of these photographs were labeled using the Amazon Mechanical Turk.
[02:02:28.540 --> 02:02:30.460]   And boy, the results are obvious.
[02:02:30.460 --> 02:02:35.060]   But the point of this is it shows why we've got to be really careful with face recognition
[02:02:35.060 --> 02:02:38.580]   and other AI based on machine learning.
[02:02:38.580 --> 02:02:44.940]   These databases are often corrupt, polluted for a variety of reasons.
[02:02:44.940 --> 02:02:52.020]   I mean, it's no surprise that Amazon's recognition does a terrible, it does fine with white
[02:02:52.020 --> 02:02:54.340]   people, does a terrible job with people of color.
[02:02:54.340 --> 02:02:55.340]   No surprise.
[02:02:55.340 --> 02:02:58.820]   Now we just boy, we saw that and not just saw it in action.
[02:02:58.820 --> 02:02:59.820]   Wrong do it.
[02:02:59.820 --> 02:03:00.820]   Sorry, my friend.
[02:03:00.820 --> 02:03:01.820]   It's terrible.
[02:03:01.820 --> 02:03:05.260]   It actually feels like it hurt your, it hurt your, it hurt your feelings.
[02:03:05.260 --> 02:03:06.260]   It did.
[02:03:06.260 --> 02:03:07.260]   That's sad.
[02:03:07.260 --> 02:03:09.260]   That's even in this domain.
[02:03:09.260 --> 02:03:11.340]   That was just sad.
[02:03:11.340 --> 02:03:17.900]   Wrong do it was exactly in the title, by the way, of the article.
[02:03:17.900 --> 02:03:22.220]   The only thing that I want to add is this is they call it a digital art project.
[02:03:22.220 --> 02:03:29.380]   And I mean, they say it comes from ImageNet data.
[02:03:29.380 --> 02:03:34.580]   But you know, it's interesting that came up with the same wrongdoer and offender that
[02:03:34.580 --> 02:03:38.700]   it did in the New York Times article for a 24 year old African American.
[02:03:38.700 --> 02:03:43.260]   This is why this stuff has to be trained over and over and over.
[02:03:43.260 --> 02:03:44.260]   Yeah.
[02:03:44.260 --> 02:03:45.260]   You know, it's not ready.
[02:03:45.260 --> 02:03:46.420]   And you've got to test it again.
[02:03:46.420 --> 02:03:50.700]   You also have to test it against known problems that are going to exist.
[02:03:50.700 --> 02:03:56.260]   You've got to design in the fact that people will do crap for the sake of doing crap.
[02:03:56.260 --> 02:04:02.660]   So the website we're using was designed by an American artist, Trevor Paglin, and a Microsoft
[02:04:02.660 --> 02:04:05.860]   researcher named Kate Crawford.
[02:04:05.860 --> 02:04:09.660]   Paglin said to the New York Times, "We want to show how layers of bias and racism and
[02:04:09.660 --> 02:04:12.140]   misogyny move from one system to the next.
[02:04:12.140 --> 02:04:15.420]   The point is to let people see the work that is being done behind the scenes to see how
[02:04:15.420 --> 02:04:16.420]   we're being processed."
[02:04:16.420 --> 02:04:22.780]   I'm not clear that when they say it's an art project, if these are actual results or
[02:04:22.780 --> 02:04:23.780]   if...
[02:04:23.780 --> 02:04:28.820]   Yeah, I couldn't get to the source of the problem in the article.
[02:04:28.820 --> 02:04:32.020]   Times did not do a good job of describing it.
[02:04:32.020 --> 02:04:34.420]   It is in the art and design section.
[02:04:34.420 --> 02:04:38.540]   If it's an art project, it may well be that they just automatically label every African
[02:04:38.540 --> 02:04:41.700]   American that way to kind of show the problem.
[02:04:41.700 --> 02:04:42.700]   Who knows?
[02:04:42.700 --> 02:04:43.700]   We're not really...
[02:04:43.700 --> 02:04:44.700]   We're not really...
[02:04:44.700 --> 02:04:53.420]   Kate Crawford is a legit smart AI institute person at NYU.
[02:04:53.420 --> 02:04:58.820]   So if this was done to make all technology look bad, I'd have a problem with that, if
[02:04:58.820 --> 02:05:04.380]   it was done to enable many people, what was that thing where the bot...
[02:05:04.380 --> 02:05:06.380]   The bot became horrible and racist.
[02:05:06.380 --> 02:05:08.380]   You had to make yourself buy it.
[02:05:08.380 --> 02:05:11.100]   Hey, this is Microsoft again.
[02:05:11.100 --> 02:05:13.180]   So let me get this...
[02:05:13.180 --> 02:05:14.740]   I kind of misstated this.
[02:05:14.740 --> 02:05:20.060]   ImageNet is the art project and in fact ImageNet used Amazon Mechanical Turk.
[02:05:20.060 --> 02:05:27.020]   So it sounds like those labels really were assigned, but ImageNet is not used by law
[02:05:27.020 --> 02:05:29.220]   enforcement.
[02:05:29.220 --> 02:05:33.900]   The labels originally came from another collection of data called WorldNet, which was built
[02:05:33.900 --> 02:05:39.460]   in the '80s by Princeton University researchers.
[02:05:39.460 --> 02:05:43.260]   But with those inflammatory labels included, the Stanford researchers may not have realized
[02:05:43.260 --> 02:05:44.260]   what they were doing.
[02:05:44.260 --> 02:05:45.260]   It's unclear to me.
[02:05:45.260 --> 02:05:51.580]   It's really hard to get to the base of who did what for why here.
[02:05:51.580 --> 02:05:54.460]   And this is getting shut down this week, no?
[02:05:54.460 --> 02:05:59.420]   Yeah, they said the point made were shutting it down on the 27th, which is tomorrow.
[02:05:59.420 --> 02:06:00.420]   Good.
[02:06:00.420 --> 02:06:02.100]   I think we can shut it down right now.
[02:06:02.100 --> 02:06:03.100]   It's more...
[02:06:03.100 --> 02:06:05.100]   I think this was used though by law enforcement.
[02:06:05.100 --> 02:06:06.100]   That's the thing.
[02:06:06.100 --> 02:06:07.100]   It's not clear.
[02:06:07.100 --> 02:06:08.100]   It's not clear.
[02:06:08.100 --> 02:06:13.740]   But it does really bring home the point, which is biases creep into this.
[02:06:13.740 --> 02:06:14.740]   That's what we're saying.
[02:06:14.740 --> 02:06:16.740]   Oh, it's just...
[02:06:16.740 --> 02:06:19.300]   Everybody is not ready for this power.
[02:06:19.300 --> 02:06:21.660]   Every entity is not ready for this power.
[02:06:21.660 --> 02:06:24.380]   And that's what Mistacey was trying to argue last week with.
[02:06:24.380 --> 02:06:27.900]   Yeah, we like to take, but it's not ready.
[02:06:27.900 --> 02:06:30.980]   Are you ready to buy a spot?
[02:06:30.980 --> 02:06:34.740]   Boston Dynamics robot is now available for these.
[02:06:34.740 --> 02:06:35.980]   That's get Leo to buy one.
[02:06:35.980 --> 02:06:36.980]   I really...
[02:06:36.980 --> 02:06:37.980]   You can't buy and need one.
[02:06:37.980 --> 02:06:38.980]   You can leave it.
[02:06:38.980 --> 02:06:39.980]   I need it.
[02:06:39.980 --> 02:06:40.980]   How much?
[02:06:40.980 --> 02:06:43.980]   If you find out how much it is, it's probably 10 grand a month.
[02:06:43.980 --> 02:06:44.980]   I doubt the dog.
[02:06:44.980 --> 02:06:48.580]   I don't expect it's probably 10 grand a month.
[02:06:48.580 --> 02:06:52.420]   But if you could get a robot, if we could get a robot for the studio that does this...
[02:06:52.420 --> 02:06:53.420]   Oh no.
[02:06:53.420 --> 02:07:00.820]   It looks like the toilet.
[02:07:00.820 --> 02:07:01.820]   It's working very well.
[02:07:01.820 --> 02:07:07.740]   It's a dancing robot.
[02:07:07.740 --> 02:07:13.900]   So for those of you listening and enjoying this fabulous song, "Uptown Funk" by Bruno
[02:07:13.900 --> 02:07:16.260]   Mars, which of course is going to get us taken down.
[02:07:16.260 --> 02:07:17.740]   Wow, look at that.
[02:07:17.740 --> 02:07:18.740]   Oh my goodness.
[02:07:18.740 --> 02:07:19.980]   That's a good dance.
[02:07:19.980 --> 02:07:20.980]   It's doing that.
[02:07:20.980 --> 02:07:22.820]   What do they call that when you do it?
[02:07:22.820 --> 02:07:23.820]   Running man.
[02:07:23.820 --> 02:07:24.820]   Man.
[02:07:24.820 --> 02:07:26.820]   It's got the hip action.
[02:07:26.820 --> 02:07:27.820]   Uh oh.
[02:07:27.820 --> 02:07:28.820]   Watch out.
[02:07:28.820 --> 02:07:29.820]   Here comes a claw for you.
[02:07:29.820 --> 02:07:36.820]   Oh, now it's twerking.
[02:07:36.820 --> 02:07:37.820]   Okay.
[02:07:37.820 --> 02:07:40.060]   It keeps up with the bear.
[02:07:40.060 --> 02:07:42.740]   Of course, it doesn't have much of a butt.
[02:07:42.740 --> 02:07:46.020]   The program in prowess in this is just amazing.
[02:07:46.020 --> 02:07:47.020]   That's it.
[02:07:47.020 --> 02:07:50.140]   Well for all we know, it would be easy enough to write a little program that actually has
[02:07:50.140 --> 02:07:51.380]   a human doing it.
[02:07:51.380 --> 02:07:53.900]   Yeah, it mimics it.
[02:07:53.900 --> 02:07:58.900]   So a story in Fast Company says that the cost of the early adopter, Elise, will be less
[02:07:58.900 --> 02:08:00.900]   than the price of a car.
[02:08:00.900 --> 02:08:03.900]   Well, that's a pretty broad range.
[02:08:03.900 --> 02:08:04.900]   Right.
[02:08:04.900 --> 02:08:05.900]   Which car?
[02:08:05.900 --> 02:08:06.900]   Which car?
[02:08:06.900 --> 02:08:07.900]   Are you going to show the other video?
[02:08:07.900 --> 02:08:09.660]   The other video is even better.
[02:08:09.660 --> 02:08:10.820]   You want to see the...
[02:08:10.820 --> 02:08:11.860]   This is another robot.
[02:08:11.860 --> 02:08:14.460]   This is Atlas doing gymnastics.
[02:08:14.460 --> 02:08:19.780]   This is the robot I should point out that was so mistreated by the researcher who poked
[02:08:19.780 --> 02:08:21.740]   at it with a stick and pushed it over.
[02:08:21.740 --> 02:08:22.740]   That's a lie.
[02:08:22.740 --> 02:08:25.140]   What do you mean that's a lie?
[02:08:25.140 --> 02:08:26.980]   That was faked.
[02:08:26.980 --> 02:08:31.020]   And pushed it over, one was faked.
[02:08:31.020 --> 02:08:33.140]   Now Boston Dynamics doesn't fake their...
[02:08:33.140 --> 02:08:34.980]   Wow, look at this.
[02:08:34.980 --> 02:08:36.700]   It's doing summer salts.
[02:08:36.700 --> 02:08:38.820]   It's doing splits in the air.
[02:08:38.820 --> 02:08:41.620]   It's doing back flips, flips, twists.
[02:08:41.620 --> 02:08:42.620]   Very loose.
[02:08:42.620 --> 02:08:43.620]   Retin.
[02:08:43.620 --> 02:08:44.620]   Robot.
[02:08:44.620 --> 02:08:45.620]   Retin robot.
[02:08:45.620 --> 02:08:46.620]   So there's a value to this.
[02:08:46.620 --> 02:08:48.620]   It's showing a lot of agility.
[02:08:48.620 --> 02:08:53.540]   The reason you want to buy a pedal robot is because a lot of spaces are built for humans.
[02:08:53.540 --> 02:08:57.980]   And if you want to build a, let's say, rescue robot that needs to be able to go upstairs
[02:08:57.980 --> 02:08:59.980]   and her doors do that kind of thing.
[02:08:59.980 --> 02:09:00.980]   Caves.
[02:09:00.980 --> 02:09:06.580]   It's easiest to make it be kind of human-like by pedal.
[02:09:06.580 --> 02:09:10.860]   Although Spot, which is the robotic dog, is a quadrepad.
[02:09:10.860 --> 02:09:12.340]   What you think about the...
[02:09:12.340 --> 02:09:17.860]   Wasn't it just last summer when some kids or some workers were trapped in some cave and...
[02:09:17.860 --> 02:09:20.100]   Oh, the Chilean cave?
[02:09:20.100 --> 02:09:21.100]   Miners.
[02:09:21.100 --> 02:09:22.100]   Yeah.
[02:09:22.100 --> 02:09:23.100]   Miners.
[02:09:23.100 --> 02:09:25.660]   Or the kids in Thailand or the soccer team in Thailand.
[02:09:25.660 --> 02:09:26.660]   Yeah.
[02:09:26.660 --> 02:09:27.660]   Right.
[02:09:27.660 --> 02:09:29.940]   Fortunately, Elon has a submarine for that.
[02:09:29.940 --> 02:09:30.940]   Oh, yes.
[02:09:30.940 --> 02:09:31.940]   Real quick.
[02:09:31.940 --> 02:09:33.740]   It won't be my pick of the week, but I will mention it.
[02:09:33.740 --> 02:09:41.780]   Cloudflare, which has for a long time done 1.1.1, which was a way of hiding your DNS lookups
[02:09:41.780 --> 02:09:46.100]   from your Internet service provider, has now added warp to it.
[02:09:46.100 --> 02:09:47.100]   They had promised this.
[02:09:47.100 --> 02:09:48.100]   It's sort of...
[02:09:48.100 --> 02:09:50.180]   It's a quasi-VPN.
[02:09:50.180 --> 02:09:55.140]   It's missing the features of a VPN that let you choose what country you emerge in.
[02:09:55.140 --> 02:10:00.660]   Your IP address will still be visible to the sites that you go to visit, but it will encrypt
[02:10:00.660 --> 02:10:02.780]   your data from your phone.
[02:10:02.780 --> 02:10:09.900]   It has an app for both Android and iOS, and I've turned it on, and it seems to work.
[02:10:09.900 --> 02:10:10.900]   Encrypt your phone.
[02:10:10.900 --> 02:10:16.620]   Now, they have a free version of warp, and then there's Warp Plus, which is five bucks
[02:10:16.620 --> 02:10:19.020]   a month in the US.
[02:10:19.020 --> 02:10:23.020]   Although, Cloudflare says, "It varies by region.
[02:10:23.020 --> 02:10:29.260]   We're trying to approximate the price of a McDonald's Big Mac in your area, so per month."
[02:10:29.260 --> 02:10:30.580]   So I paid the five bucks.
[02:10:30.580 --> 02:10:35.180]   It does seem as fast as not using warp, which is good for a VPN.
[02:10:35.180 --> 02:10:36.180]   Yes, really good.
[02:10:36.180 --> 02:10:40.700]   It's using their own private backbone to do Warp Plus, which gives it higher speeds.
[02:10:40.700 --> 02:10:47.660]   But you might try 1.1.1, and if you've got that, everybody now can turn on Warp, which
[02:10:47.660 --> 02:10:52.220]   will give you some additional security on Open Wi-Fi access points.
[02:10:52.220 --> 02:10:58.140]   Now, the other issue that comes up is that you are no longer directing your DNS and other
[02:10:58.140 --> 02:11:03.940]   traffic to your Internet service provider, but you aren't directing it to Cloudflare.
[02:11:03.940 --> 02:11:08.540]   I trust Cloudflare, but they are a company.
[02:11:08.540 --> 02:11:13.500]   They say we're not going to use your information in any malicious way, and I trust them when
[02:11:13.500 --> 02:11:14.500]   they say that.
[02:11:14.500 --> 02:11:16.100]   Trust them over Comcast, right?
[02:11:16.100 --> 02:11:17.100]   Pretty much.
[02:11:17.100 --> 02:11:18.940]   That's a rhetorical question.
[02:11:18.940 --> 02:11:26.460]   Yeah, but it is something to be aware of that as with any VPN, you have to trust Cloudflare's
[02:11:26.460 --> 02:11:27.460]   privacy.
[02:11:27.460 --> 02:11:30.100]   They say, "We don't write user-identifiable log data to disks.
[02:11:30.100 --> 02:11:33.620]   We'll never sell your data or use it in any way to target you.
[02:11:33.620 --> 02:11:38.340]   You don't give them any personal information in order to use it, and we will regularly
[02:11:38.340 --> 02:11:42.500]   work with outside auditors," which is all you could ask for.
[02:11:42.500 --> 02:11:46.260]   So it's a VPN, but it's a different kind of VPN.
[02:11:46.260 --> 02:11:49.500]   We should read the post at Cloudflare, blog.cloudflare.com.
[02:11:49.500 --> 02:11:50.500]   I like Cloudflare.
[02:11:50.500 --> 02:11:51.500]   Nice work.
[02:11:51.500 --> 02:11:52.500]   I am using Warp.
[02:11:52.500 --> 02:11:54.660]   I've used one Quad One for a while, 1.1.1.1.
[02:11:54.660 --> 02:11:56.660]   And I'm now turned on Warp.
[02:11:56.660 --> 02:11:58.420]   Other people use Google's, right?
[02:11:58.420 --> 02:11:59.420]   Eight.
[02:11:59.420 --> 02:12:00.420]   Quad Eight.
[02:12:00.420 --> 02:12:01.420]   That's Verizon.
[02:12:01.420 --> 02:12:02.420]   Google's.
[02:12:02.420 --> 02:12:03.420]   There's Quad Nine, which is another company.
[02:12:03.420 --> 02:12:05.300]   Google's Quad Four, I think.
[02:12:05.300 --> 02:12:06.300]   Okay.
[02:12:06.300 --> 02:12:09.180]   Yeah, so in each case, the difference...
[02:12:09.180 --> 02:12:11.380]   The other thing is I use Firefox.
[02:12:11.380 --> 02:12:17.140]   Firefox, you could turn DNS over HTTPS on, but it also uses Cloudflare.
[02:12:17.140 --> 02:12:24.220]   So pick your tomato tomato.
[02:12:24.220 --> 02:12:26.180]   Tomato tomato.
[02:12:26.180 --> 02:12:30.140]   I know John Graham Cummings was their CTO.
[02:12:30.140 --> 02:12:31.140]   I trust them.
[02:12:31.140 --> 02:12:33.180]   I think they're a very good company.
[02:12:33.180 --> 02:12:38.780]   And if anything, they'll use the data to kind of improve their DDoS service and their
[02:12:38.780 --> 02:12:40.980]   CDN service for their customers.
[02:12:40.980 --> 02:12:43.060]   But other than that, I think that's fine.
[02:12:43.060 --> 02:12:45.580]   Our show today brought to you by Monday.com.
[02:12:45.580 --> 02:12:48.500]   Monday helps teams manage work.
[02:12:48.500 --> 02:12:51.020]   You all are managers now, meeting deadlines.
[02:12:51.020 --> 02:12:52.020]   We...
[02:12:52.020 --> 02:12:53.460]   I love how Monday works.
[02:12:53.460 --> 02:12:56.580]   Builds a culture of transparency to work better together.
[02:12:56.580 --> 02:13:00.820]   Manage all your core business activities in one place from high level road maps to specific
[02:13:00.820 --> 02:13:02.380]   day-to-day tasks.
[02:13:02.380 --> 02:13:03.980]   You just have to try it.
[02:13:03.980 --> 02:13:05.220]   It is so beautiful.
[02:13:05.220 --> 02:13:07.420]   It is so modern.
[02:13:07.420 --> 02:13:08.420]   You can...
[02:13:08.420 --> 02:13:11.860]   They have apps, absolutely, but you also have the web dashboard.
[02:13:11.860 --> 02:13:16.740]   You can upload files from your computer, from Dropbox, Google Drive.
[02:13:16.740 --> 02:13:20.540]   You can build a board from scratch, but they also have hundreds of beautiful templates
[02:13:20.540 --> 02:13:21.940]   to get you started.
[02:13:21.940 --> 02:13:25.740]   You can automate your workflows with reminders and notifications.
[02:13:25.740 --> 02:13:30.220]   Monday.com is great for a team of any size, whether it's two freelancers working across
[02:13:30.220 --> 02:13:34.060]   the globe with thousands, collaborating.
[02:13:34.060 --> 02:13:35.060]   Teams love it.
[02:13:35.060 --> 02:13:39.220]   It's rid of the Excel files on the whiteboards, and most importantly, get rid of those long,
[02:13:39.220 --> 02:13:41.220]   boring meetings.
[02:13:41.220 --> 02:13:44.580]   Create accountability by assigning owners to keep track of who's doing what.
[02:13:44.580 --> 02:13:46.580]   And I love the My Week feature because it's like...
[02:13:46.580 --> 02:13:49.820]   It's almost like a personal assistant reminding you what you're going to be doing this week.
[02:13:49.820 --> 02:13:51.820]   What your team will be doing.
[02:13:51.820 --> 02:13:56.100]   You will want to hug the people that created Monday.com.
[02:13:56.100 --> 02:13:58.660]   I love it, you will, too.
[02:13:58.660 --> 02:14:00.860]   65,000 teams are already using it.
[02:14:00.860 --> 02:14:01.940]   You should be one of them.
[02:14:01.940 --> 02:14:02.940]   Go to...
[02:14:02.940 --> 02:14:04.740]   Look at that discovery.
[02:14:04.740 --> 02:14:05.740]   This is it.
[02:14:05.740 --> 02:14:06.740]   It's fantastic.
[02:14:06.740 --> 02:14:08.740]   Go to mondaymonda.com/twig.
[02:14:08.740 --> 02:14:11.300]   You've got a two-week trial.
[02:14:11.300 --> 02:14:12.460]   Why not try it?
[02:14:12.460 --> 02:14:14.460]   Monday.com/twig.
[02:14:14.460 --> 02:14:17.660]   Monday is a new way to work.
[02:14:17.660 --> 02:14:18.660]   Awesome.
[02:14:18.660 --> 02:14:19.580]   Awesome.
[02:14:19.580 --> 02:14:23.620]   Let's do the Google change log.
[02:14:23.620 --> 02:14:25.620]   The music.
[02:14:25.620 --> 02:14:27.620]   The Google change log.
[02:14:27.620 --> 02:14:30.260]   I'm going to do this fast.
[02:14:30.260 --> 02:14:33.660]   We don't have a lot of time.
[02:14:33.660 --> 02:14:35.660]   The Google Play Pass.
[02:14:35.660 --> 02:14:42.740]   As soon as Apple announced a $5 Apple Arcade, which you get 100 plus games for $5 a month,
[02:14:42.740 --> 02:14:45.540]   Google said, "Hold my beer."
[02:14:45.540 --> 02:14:50.820]   And announced Google Play Pass, $5 a month, apps as well as games without ads, without
[02:14:50.820 --> 02:14:53.260]   an app purchases.
[02:14:53.260 --> 02:14:57.660]   Of course, I immediately subscribe, especially because for the next year, it's only about
[02:14:57.660 --> 02:14:59.420]   99 a month.
[02:14:59.420 --> 02:15:02.140]   And you get a 10-day free trial.
[02:15:02.140 --> 02:15:11.140]   Play Pass has a lot of software that you might pay for, including games, Stardew Valley, Risk.
[02:15:11.140 --> 02:15:16.940]   There's a lot of other apps, though, AccuWeather, White Noise Generator, Voice Recorder Pro.
[02:15:16.940 --> 02:15:20.300]   I think this is a really interesting play from Google.
[02:15:20.300 --> 02:15:24.020]   And it is definitely a response to Apple's Arcade.
[02:15:24.020 --> 02:15:26.620]   And like Apple's Arcade, it works with the family.
[02:15:26.620 --> 02:15:33.060]   So $5 a month or actually this year $1.99 a month will give all your family members free
[02:15:33.060 --> 02:15:34.060]   games as well.
[02:15:34.060 --> 02:15:37.060]   I signed up for it and I have no idea what I signed up for.
[02:15:37.060 --> 02:15:38.060]   I know what you mean.
[02:15:38.060 --> 02:15:40.060]   You've been hanging out with Leo too much.
[02:15:40.060 --> 02:15:42.260]   I was like, "Why am I so alive?"
[02:15:42.260 --> 02:15:45.980]   I was sitting here watching all about Android last night and they brought it up and I'm
[02:15:45.980 --> 02:15:48.100]   thinking, "I guess I should look."
[02:15:48.100 --> 02:15:49.340]   I must have that.
[02:15:49.340 --> 02:15:51.220]   I must have.
[02:15:51.220 --> 02:15:52.220]   Mini Metro's a fun game.
[02:15:52.220 --> 02:15:53.220]   It's your patronage.
[02:15:53.220 --> 02:15:55.380]   Yeah, exactly.
[02:15:55.380 --> 02:16:01.160]   I mean, I think in some ways what Apple's doing and now Google is responding to the
[02:16:01.160 --> 02:16:06.620]   blight that in-app purchases have created, especially for games.
[02:16:06.620 --> 02:16:12.740]   It just kills the pleasure if you have to spend money on donuts or candy or whatever.
[02:16:12.740 --> 02:16:15.140]   And I think they're doing it.
[02:16:15.140 --> 02:16:19.060]   Google Nest Wi-Fi is adding an assistant speaker.
[02:16:19.060 --> 02:16:22.820]   We knew this for a while and this is not what it will look like.
[02:16:22.820 --> 02:16:26.380]   This is 9-5 Google's artistic rendition.
[02:16:26.380 --> 02:16:28.740]   Basically Google Wi-Fi with a Google--
[02:16:28.740 --> 02:16:30.780]   It makes me laugh every time I see it.
[02:16:30.780 --> 02:16:31.780]   Hot and hot.
[02:16:31.780 --> 02:16:34.260]   That picture, yeah.
[02:16:34.260 --> 02:16:39.140]   Don't know what to say about it, but there you go.
[02:16:39.140 --> 02:16:40.940]   When that release it will have more.
[02:16:40.940 --> 02:16:44.140]   This is a 9-5 scoop.
[02:16:44.140 --> 02:16:50.380]   They are-- Google is doing this, making assistant work even if you don't have Google Assistant.
[02:16:50.380 --> 02:16:53.700]   I mean, if you don't have internet access, that's of course important to name.
[02:16:53.700 --> 02:16:55.260]   This is really cool.
[02:16:55.260 --> 02:16:56.260]   Yeah.
[02:16:56.260 --> 02:16:59.020]   Colleen, I don't know how they do it.
[02:16:59.020 --> 02:17:00.020]   This voice.
[02:17:00.020 --> 02:17:01.020]   Yeah.
[02:17:01.020 --> 02:17:02.020]   Phone voice.
[02:17:02.020 --> 02:17:07.620]   It's on feature phones, a Vodafone in India, Idea Telecom networks in India.
[02:17:07.620 --> 02:17:09.540]   They're making the call free.
[02:17:09.540 --> 02:17:10.540]   Oh, I get it.
[02:17:10.540 --> 02:17:11.540]   You make a call.
[02:17:11.540 --> 02:17:12.540]   It's a call.
[02:17:12.540 --> 02:17:13.540]   It's a call.
[02:17:13.540 --> 02:17:14.540]   Right.
[02:17:14.540 --> 02:17:15.540]   It's a call.
[02:17:15.540 --> 02:17:16.540]   Right.
[02:17:16.540 --> 02:17:17.540]   Even though it's a feature call.
[02:17:17.540 --> 02:17:19.620]   I mean, people with feature phones can now ask questions and Vickers has a big impact on
[02:17:19.620 --> 02:17:20.620]   literacy.
[02:17:20.620 --> 02:17:21.620]   Oh, that's so cool.
[02:17:21.620 --> 02:17:22.620]   That sounds cool.
[02:17:22.620 --> 02:17:28.380]   So if you're in India on those two carriers, dial and they don't make it easy.
[02:17:28.380 --> 02:17:34.460]   0, 0, 0, 8, 0, 0, 9, 1, 9, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0.
[02:17:34.460 --> 02:17:38.820]   4, 1, 1, 2, 5, 2, 5.
[02:17:38.820 --> 02:17:41.420]   Stroke 1, 3, 3, 3.
[02:17:41.420 --> 02:17:43.780]   Notice the left question they ask for.
[02:17:43.780 --> 02:17:48.060]   What is Sachin Tendulkar famous for?
[02:17:48.060 --> 02:17:49.060]   No idea.
[02:17:49.060 --> 02:17:51.060]   I'm going to try that.
[02:17:51.060 --> 02:17:52.060]   I'm going to try to ask.
[02:17:52.060 --> 02:17:53.540]   Try asking how do I cook?
[02:17:53.540 --> 02:18:00.180]   What is Sachin Tendulkar famous for?
[02:18:00.180 --> 02:18:03.260]   I'm going to guess cricket.
[02:18:03.260 --> 02:18:04.420]   Either that or Bollywood.
[02:18:04.420 --> 02:18:09.500]   You're an airplane mode.
[02:18:09.500 --> 02:18:12.420]   What is Sachin Tendulkar famous for?
[02:18:12.420 --> 02:18:14.340]   World's youngest test cricketer.
[02:18:14.340 --> 02:18:15.340]   Cricketer.
[02:18:15.340 --> 02:18:19.860]   Oh, he also wrote the great book, Playing It My Way.
[02:18:19.860 --> 02:18:23.060]   He became the first cricketer to score 35 centuries.
[02:18:23.060 --> 02:18:24.060]   Wow.
[02:18:24.060 --> 02:18:25.060]   You're telling him.
[02:18:25.060 --> 02:18:26.980]   100 runs in a single inning.
[02:18:26.980 --> 02:18:29.060]   That's why that game goes on forever.
[02:18:29.060 --> 02:18:30.620]   Wow.
[02:18:30.620 --> 02:18:34.460]   Is that one game he had 35 centuries or just 35?
[02:18:34.460 --> 02:18:35.460]   35 centuries.
[02:18:35.460 --> 02:18:38.500]   But within a century, it's 100 runs.
[02:18:38.500 --> 02:18:43.900]   It runs in an inning.
[02:18:43.900 --> 02:18:49.820]   But also, Amazon's announced that its service now understands and speaks Hindi.
[02:18:49.820 --> 02:18:52.740]   So I'm guessing the Indian market pretty important.
[02:18:52.740 --> 02:18:54.620]   1.3 billion people.
[02:18:54.620 --> 02:18:55.620]   Yep.
[02:18:55.620 --> 02:18:56.620]   Pretty important.
[02:18:56.620 --> 02:19:04.820]   In fact, the new Apple Watch actually has faces designed for people speaking Indian languages.
[02:19:04.820 --> 02:19:05.820]   Nice.
[02:19:05.820 --> 02:19:07.300]   How about that?
[02:19:07.300 --> 02:19:08.820]   Nice, Sach.
[02:19:08.820 --> 02:19:16.820]   And now Google is promoting synonyms in search.
[02:19:16.820 --> 02:19:21.020]   I tried to test this and I typed in define synonyms.
[02:19:21.020 --> 02:19:23.620]   So it gave me synonyms for the word define.
[02:19:23.620 --> 02:19:24.620]   Oh.
[02:19:24.620 --> 02:19:28.900]   I couldn't get it to show me that I wanted to find the synonyms for synonyms.
[02:19:28.900 --> 02:19:34.020]   So if you ask for a definition, normally, if you say something like define sympathy,
[02:19:34.020 --> 02:19:38.540]   we'll give you the definition.
[02:19:38.540 --> 02:19:40.340]   But also now synonyms.
[02:19:40.340 --> 02:19:41.900]   Synonyms.
[02:19:41.900 --> 02:19:46.300]   So you no longer need your roger's the source.
[02:19:46.300 --> 02:19:48.940]   I just bought a book about Mr. roger's.
[02:19:48.940 --> 02:19:50.340]   Your roger?
[02:19:50.340 --> 02:19:55.660]   He didn't do the source until he was like my age, Septigenarium.
[02:19:55.660 --> 02:20:00.260]   You have no idea how underrated that the source is until you start writing.
[02:20:00.260 --> 02:20:01.260]   Do people...
[02:20:01.260 --> 02:20:03.860]   It's good to know that young people like you have the story.
[02:20:03.860 --> 02:20:05.380]   I have to look it up.
[02:20:05.380 --> 02:20:10.740]   I have a bookshelf of all of the obsolete tools of writer.
[02:20:10.740 --> 02:20:16.220]   Including the 26 volume Oxford English Dictionary.
[02:20:16.220 --> 02:20:18.380]   You have the entire OED.
[02:20:18.380 --> 02:20:19.380]   Oh yeah.
[02:20:19.380 --> 02:20:25.420]   Well, that was just because everyone should.
[02:20:25.420 --> 02:20:26.420]   Right.
[02:20:26.420 --> 02:20:27.420]   Wow.
[02:20:27.420 --> 02:20:31.660]   And all the dictionaries next to that and those roger's.
[02:20:31.660 --> 02:20:37.420]   Oh God, all the different books and things that you're supposed to have and then the
[02:20:37.420 --> 02:20:38.420]   style guides.
[02:20:38.420 --> 02:20:41.580]   And of course I never consult them.
[02:20:41.580 --> 02:20:42.580]   WPA.
[02:20:42.580 --> 02:20:45.780]   Right above, actually my office at home is a museum.
[02:20:45.780 --> 02:20:50.380]   Right above the Oxford English Dictionary is all the volumes of World Book Encyclopedia
[02:20:50.380 --> 02:20:51.380]   from like 1990.
[02:20:51.380 --> 02:20:53.540]   Oh man, World Book was awesome.
[02:20:53.540 --> 02:20:56.420]   Well, when I was a kid in 1965, my parents bought that.
[02:20:56.420 --> 02:20:57.980]   And I would read it.
[02:20:57.980 --> 02:20:58.980]   I loved it.
[02:20:58.980 --> 02:20:59.980]   I just thought, oh this is great.
[02:20:59.980 --> 02:21:01.740]   I'd go to the bathroom with the S volume.
[02:21:01.740 --> 02:21:02.900]   I just read it.
[02:21:02.900 --> 02:21:03.900]   So in A volume.
[02:21:03.900 --> 02:21:04.900]   In A volume.
[02:21:04.900 --> 02:21:05.900]   In A volume.
[02:21:05.900 --> 02:21:06.900]   Well, A for animals.
[02:21:06.900 --> 02:21:07.900]   I'm an animal.
[02:21:07.900 --> 02:21:10.180]   So yeah, I like old...
[02:21:10.180 --> 02:21:14.740]   So he was born in 1779.
[02:21:14.740 --> 02:21:21.940]   He didn't start working on the Thesserus until 1846.
[02:21:21.940 --> 02:21:22.940]   Wow.
[02:21:22.940 --> 02:21:23.940]   Wow.
[02:21:23.940 --> 02:21:24.940]   Yes.
[02:21:24.940 --> 02:21:25.940]   That's me.
[02:21:25.940 --> 02:21:26.940]   That's your generic guest.
[02:21:26.940 --> 02:21:28.540]   When is your tip this week?
[02:21:28.540 --> 02:21:32.620]   Actually, this is actually, believe it or not, there's also Paul Therod's tip on Windows
[02:21:32.620 --> 02:21:33.620]   Weekly.
[02:21:33.620 --> 02:21:34.620]   Oh, I had no idea.
[02:21:34.620 --> 02:21:35.620]   Yeah.
[02:21:35.620 --> 02:21:36.620]   That's funny.
[02:21:36.620 --> 02:21:37.620]   You guys are in sync.
[02:21:37.620 --> 02:21:38.620]   All right.
[02:21:38.620 --> 02:21:39.820]   Well, he's programming on a Chromebook as am I.
[02:21:39.820 --> 02:21:42.100]   I'm taking compsci classes.
[02:21:42.100 --> 02:21:46.460]   And my pick this week was a very big surprise to me.
[02:21:46.460 --> 02:21:53.460]   There's a video series on Google's YouTube about programming or how to learn Python programming,
[02:21:53.460 --> 02:21:56.420]   which is a pretty simple but powerful language to learn.
[02:21:56.420 --> 02:22:00.340]   So if you want to get into programming, I recommend it.
[02:22:00.340 --> 02:22:03.860]   This video series comes from Microsoft of all people.
[02:22:03.860 --> 02:22:06.660]   Yeah, it's like 40 some videos.
[02:22:06.660 --> 02:22:07.660]   Wow.
[02:22:07.660 --> 02:22:08.660]   Yeah.
[02:22:08.660 --> 02:22:09.660]   Nice.
[02:22:09.660 --> 02:22:10.660]   Good on them.
[02:22:10.660 --> 02:22:11.660]   That's really cool.
[02:22:11.660 --> 02:22:13.340]   Good on them.
[02:22:13.340 --> 02:22:16.900]   So it talks about Visual Studio Code, which is an excellent tool.
[02:22:16.900 --> 02:22:18.540]   You can, I think you can use that.
[02:22:18.540 --> 02:22:19.540]   There's a Linux version of it.
[02:22:19.540 --> 02:22:20.540]   So I think you can use that.
[02:22:20.540 --> 02:22:21.540]   Oh, yeah.
[02:22:21.540 --> 02:22:22.540]   No, I run that on my Chromebooks.
[02:22:22.540 --> 02:22:23.540]   Absolutely.
[02:22:23.540 --> 02:22:24.540]   I really love Visual Studio Code.
[02:22:24.540 --> 02:22:25.660]   It's clean and simple.
[02:22:25.660 --> 02:22:26.660]   It's just fantastic.
[02:22:26.660 --> 02:22:27.660]   Yeah.
[02:22:27.660 --> 02:22:28.660]   Wow.
[02:22:28.660 --> 02:22:29.660]   Look at this.
[02:22:29.660 --> 02:22:31.860]   And Python is a wonderful language to learn, I think.
[02:22:31.860 --> 02:22:32.860]   Yeah.
[02:22:32.860 --> 02:22:35.180]   I mean, you get the basics of object-oriented programming.
[02:22:35.180 --> 02:22:38.700]   You can do short little scripts.
[02:22:38.700 --> 02:22:40.180]   You can do server side things.
[02:22:40.180 --> 02:22:41.180]   It's pretty versatile.
[02:22:41.180 --> 02:22:42.180]   Yeah.
[02:22:42.180 --> 02:22:43.180]   Good job, Microsoft.
[02:22:43.180 --> 02:22:44.180]   Absolutely.
[02:22:44.180 --> 02:22:45.660]   Python for beginners.
[02:22:45.660 --> 02:22:47.900]   Just search for that on YouTube.
[02:22:47.900 --> 02:22:48.900]   Yep.
[02:22:48.900 --> 02:22:50.860]   What do you got for us?
[02:22:50.860 --> 02:22:57.500]   Well, I don't know if you know this, but I'm a black guy.
[02:22:57.500 --> 02:22:59.620]   Do you know that?
[02:22:59.620 --> 02:23:02.500]   I see no color.
[02:23:02.500 --> 02:23:04.380]   Well I want it to share.
[02:23:04.380 --> 02:23:08.220]   Although I do want to lick your head because it looks like it's chocolate and chocolate.
[02:23:08.220 --> 02:23:09.220]   Oh gosh.
[02:23:09.220 --> 02:23:10.220]   Oh gosh.
[02:23:10.220 --> 02:23:11.220]   That's going to be honored.
[02:23:11.220 --> 02:23:13.220]   That's going to be on the Twits best stuff.
[02:23:13.220 --> 02:23:14.220]   Twits best stuff.
[02:23:14.220 --> 02:23:15.220]   Oh gosh.
[02:23:15.220 --> 02:23:16.220]   Oh gosh.
[02:23:16.220 --> 02:23:17.220]   That's going to be honored.
[02:23:17.220 --> 02:23:18.220]   That's going to be on the Twits best stuff.
[02:23:18.220 --> 02:23:22.220]   Twits best stuff.
[02:23:22.220 --> 02:23:27.740]   I wanted to shout out a coffee company back home called Enderly Coffee.
[02:23:27.740 --> 02:23:29.100]   Oh, you've told me about this.
[02:23:29.100 --> 02:23:30.740]   This is so cool.
[02:23:30.740 --> 02:23:38.340]   They are, their model is coffee first, people always.
[02:23:38.340 --> 02:23:43.580]   I got to know these guys a couple of years ago through a mutual friend and they're just
[02:23:43.580 --> 02:23:50.140]   happy to go like a coffee people, but they decided to roast coffee there in Charlotte
[02:23:50.140 --> 02:23:56.300]   but also open up a coffee house in the hood of Charlotte.
[02:23:56.300 --> 02:23:58.260]   It's hood-tastic.
[02:23:58.260 --> 02:23:59.980]   That's the best way I can put it.
[02:23:59.980 --> 02:24:08.820]   But by doing so, they introduced fine coffee to the residence there, brought jobs and it
[02:24:08.820 --> 02:24:14.340]   was sort of weird that when I go to a coffee house to see a barista that looks like me,
[02:24:14.340 --> 02:24:17.500]   I'd never seen that until I went to Enderly.
[02:24:17.500 --> 02:24:21.900]   That's their approach is they're trying to expand it and bring more community love and
[02:24:21.900 --> 02:24:28.700]   more people to the world of coffee and just promote goodwill and spread coffee.
[02:24:28.700 --> 02:24:32.500]   But like I said, it's all about the people and they do a whole lot of other charitable
[02:24:32.500 --> 02:24:33.500]   things.
[02:24:33.500 --> 02:24:38.860]   There's some of the other coffee houses in the area, but their spot is the spot to go
[02:24:38.860 --> 02:24:43.780]   to and they have a lot of special events and raise money for charities and you look at
[02:24:43.780 --> 02:24:46.700]   their website, it's all family oriented.
[02:24:46.700 --> 02:24:47.700]   It's a great flush.
[02:24:47.700 --> 02:24:51.180]   Don't play with that guy.
[02:24:51.180 --> 02:24:54.820]   I still order from them because they do ship here.
[02:24:54.820 --> 02:24:55.820]   Good.
[02:24:55.820 --> 02:24:56.820]   You're supporting them.
[02:24:56.820 --> 02:24:57.820]   That's great.
[02:24:57.820 --> 02:24:58.820]   Everybody can do that.
[02:24:58.820 --> 02:24:59.820]   But that's Enderly coffee.
[02:24:59.820 --> 02:25:01.660]   They're N-D-E-R-L-Y coffee.
[02:25:01.660 --> 02:25:07.700]   They've raised a lot of money for students in the area to help kids go to college.
[02:25:07.700 --> 02:25:09.140]   That's great.
[02:25:09.140 --> 02:25:13.140]   They really do walk the walk.
[02:25:13.140 --> 02:25:14.300]   Charlotte, North Carolina.
[02:25:14.300 --> 02:25:15.300]   Enderly coffee.
[02:25:15.300 --> 02:25:16.300]   You don't have a laugh about you.
[02:25:16.300 --> 02:25:17.300]   You got heart.
[02:25:17.300 --> 02:25:18.380]   You bring some heart.
[02:25:18.380 --> 02:25:20.380]   You bring some heart to Twitter every time.
[02:25:20.380 --> 02:25:21.380]   I'm really glad.
[02:25:21.380 --> 02:25:22.380]   It's so great.
[02:25:22.380 --> 02:25:23.380]   Oh, no about that.
[02:25:23.380 --> 02:25:24.380]   Yeah, it's like a big tough guy.
[02:25:24.380 --> 02:25:28.180]   It breaks my heart that what the internet did to you earlier in the show.
[02:25:28.180 --> 02:25:30.180]   What did the internet do to him in the show?
[02:25:30.180 --> 02:25:31.180]   Oh, that thing.
[02:25:31.180 --> 02:25:32.180]   I'm a long doer.
[02:25:32.180 --> 02:25:33.180]   He's a right doer.
[02:25:33.180 --> 02:25:34.180]   I'm a right doer.
[02:25:34.180 --> 02:25:37.700]   Chocolate flavored right doer.
[02:25:37.700 --> 02:25:38.700]   Feel free to punch him.
[02:25:38.700 --> 02:25:39.700]   He's got three punch in.
[02:25:39.700 --> 02:25:40.700]   I don't want you to punch him.
[02:25:40.700 --> 02:25:45.460]   I don't want to destroy the screens over the set.
[02:25:45.460 --> 02:25:48.300]   I'd be flying that way.
[02:25:48.300 --> 02:25:49.300]   That's sweet.
[02:25:49.300 --> 02:25:50.300]   You're...
[02:25:50.300 --> 02:25:51.300]   Sorry.
[02:25:51.300 --> 02:25:54.300]   I bring tears to my eyes every time you're on here.
[02:25:54.300 --> 02:25:56.940]   Mr. Jeff Jarvis, number for us.
[02:25:56.940 --> 02:26:02.860]   So the president of the United States, according to Business Insider, said at the UN that,
[02:26:02.860 --> 02:26:07.340]   and I quote, "A free society cannot allow social media giants to silence the voices of
[02:26:07.340 --> 02:26:08.340]   the people.
[02:26:08.340 --> 02:26:11.620]   My administration has made clear to social media companies that we will uphold the right
[02:26:11.620 --> 02:26:12.980]   of free speech.
[02:26:12.980 --> 02:26:14.180]   What's that defined as?
[02:26:14.180 --> 02:26:19.300]   Quote, "A free people must never ever be enlisted in the cause of silencing, coercing,
[02:26:19.300 --> 02:26:21.260]   canceling or blacklisting their own neighbors."
[02:26:21.260 --> 02:26:25.380]   Of course, when people do just those things online, which is to say to try to silence
[02:26:25.380 --> 02:26:28.540]   coerce, cancel and blacklist their neighbors, that's called hate speech.
[02:26:28.540 --> 02:26:32.500]   That speech is taken down, and people like this man complain about it.
[02:26:32.500 --> 02:26:35.180]   The complaint, you're under why, was this a number?
[02:26:35.180 --> 02:26:40.620]   The complaint, according to Business Insider, reduced the fangs stocks by $58 billion.
[02:26:40.620 --> 02:26:43.740]   Now, of course, it's never a direct correlation.
[02:26:43.740 --> 02:26:51.900]   It's correlation not causation, but if they're blaming that comment on a severe drop in
[02:26:51.900 --> 02:26:53.580]   technology stocks.
[02:26:53.580 --> 02:26:55.660]   $58 billion?
[02:26:55.660 --> 02:27:01.980]   And that's just five stocks, fang, Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix and Google.
[02:27:01.980 --> 02:27:02.980]   Yeah.
[02:27:02.980 --> 02:27:04.700]   Chimney, Chris.
[02:27:04.700 --> 02:27:06.500]   Now, it will come back, right?
[02:27:06.500 --> 02:27:08.500]   Yeah, it'll come back.
[02:27:08.500 --> 02:27:10.340]   Wow.
[02:27:10.340 --> 02:27:13.700]   And that's tariffs, probably.
[02:27:13.700 --> 02:27:17.780]   And so as I made my point last week in my dystopia of dystopia pieces that nobody's
[02:27:17.780 --> 02:27:23.540]   read because it's too long on medium, Jeff Jarvis, medium.com/@jefjharvis, you'll find
[02:27:23.540 --> 02:27:24.540]   it.
[02:27:24.540 --> 02:27:28.500]   But what you're seeing is a pincer of the left and the right, both going after the tech
[02:27:28.500 --> 02:27:29.500]   companies.
[02:27:29.500 --> 02:27:30.500]   Yeah.
[02:27:30.500 --> 02:27:32.660]   And what worries me about that is that means they're going after the internet.
[02:27:32.660 --> 02:27:33.660]   Yeah.
[02:27:33.660 --> 02:27:36.060]   So, yeah, everybody hates the internet.
[02:27:36.060 --> 02:27:37.380]   Except us.
[02:27:37.380 --> 02:27:39.060]   We love the internet.
[02:27:39.060 --> 02:27:40.060]   Dang it.
[02:27:40.060 --> 02:27:42.180]   Hey, you know what else I love?
[02:27:42.180 --> 02:27:45.020]   At great expense to myself.
[02:27:45.020 --> 02:27:46.020]   Sonos.
[02:27:46.020 --> 02:27:50.140]   Just got the new Sonos move.
[02:27:50.140 --> 02:27:53.020]   This is the new Sonos battery powered portable speaker.
[02:27:53.020 --> 02:27:54.020]   That thing sounds great.
[02:27:54.020 --> 02:27:55.020]   Go ahead.
[02:27:55.020 --> 02:27:57.060]   Put some music on that, John controls it.
[02:27:57.060 --> 02:27:58.060]   It isn't that portable.
[02:27:58.060 --> 02:28:02.340]   It's pretty heavy because any good speaker can't be that small.
[02:28:02.340 --> 02:28:04.420]   It's also pretty expensive.
[02:28:04.420 --> 02:28:07.060]   That's why that Amazon speaker was kind of intriguing.
[02:28:07.060 --> 02:28:09.620]   This, these start at what is it?
[02:28:09.620 --> 02:28:10.620]   $3.99?
[02:28:10.620 --> 02:28:11.620]   Is it all?
[02:28:11.620 --> 02:28:13.140]   I don't see a light on it.
[02:28:13.140 --> 02:28:15.180]   Oh, I turned it off by accident.
[02:28:15.180 --> 02:28:16.180]   There you go.
[02:28:16.180 --> 02:28:17.180]   There you go.
[02:28:17.180 --> 02:28:18.260]   See, it'll be there in a minute.
[02:28:18.260 --> 02:28:19.300]   So there it is.
[02:28:19.300 --> 02:28:20.300]   There it is.
[02:28:20.300 --> 02:28:22.420]   You'll need two if you want to pair them for stereo.
[02:28:22.420 --> 02:28:27.820]   It's about the size of a home hub or a nice bucket.
[02:28:27.820 --> 02:28:29.660]   It has a charging stand.
[02:28:29.660 --> 02:28:32.900]   So that's why it went off because I lifted it off the charging stand.
[02:28:32.900 --> 02:28:33.900]   It's still charging.
[02:28:33.900 --> 02:28:34.900]   Go ahead.
[02:28:34.900 --> 02:28:35.900]   Try it now.
[02:28:35.900 --> 02:28:37.260]   I think you don't see it because the light is on.
[02:28:37.260 --> 02:28:42.180]   So the charging stand, it sits on and can play in the charging stand, but it also is
[02:28:42.180 --> 02:28:44.780]   apparently weatherproof so it can play outside of it.
[02:28:44.780 --> 02:28:45.780]   And we were pretty nervous.
[02:28:45.780 --> 02:28:48.180]   It sounded pretty good.
[02:28:48.180 --> 02:28:50.540]   There we go.
[02:28:50.540 --> 02:28:51.540]   Oh, it's on.
[02:28:51.540 --> 02:28:56.900]   But he can't see it.
[02:28:56.900 --> 02:29:00.180]   It also has a little microphone on the top so you can either use Google Assistant or
[02:29:00.180 --> 02:29:03.140]   Amazon Echo to play it.
[02:29:03.140 --> 02:29:04.420]   So I guess we won't get to play it.
[02:29:04.420 --> 02:29:06.060]   But you know what?
[02:29:06.060 --> 02:29:07.060]   It wouldn't make any sense.
[02:29:07.060 --> 02:29:09.260]   They just take it down.
[02:29:09.260 --> 02:29:13.660]   And all you'd be hearing is like a music through my microphone.
[02:29:13.660 --> 02:29:15.500]   I'm tinny for the listeners.
[02:29:15.500 --> 02:29:16.500]   Yeah.
[02:29:16.500 --> 02:29:19.500]   It sounded all right.
[02:29:19.500 --> 02:29:21.980]   That's the end of this week in Google.
[02:29:21.980 --> 02:29:23.780]   I do thank you so much for being here.
[02:29:23.780 --> 02:29:26.620]   Kevin Tofel, thanks for filling in for Stacey this week.
[02:29:26.620 --> 02:29:27.620]   Just love your stuff.
